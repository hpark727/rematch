    "facts_of_the_case": "In 2012, California applied for a waiver from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to implement its Advanced Clean Car Program, which included two key components: a Low Emission Vehicle Program to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 34% for new cars in Model Years 2017-2025, and a Zero Emission Vehicle Program requiring about 15% of manufacturers\u2019 fleets to be electric cars by 2025. The EPA granted this waiver in 2013, and automobile manufacturers began investing to meet these requirements.\n\nHowever, in 2019, under a different administration, the EPA withdrew the 2013 waiver, arguing that state greenhouse gas regulations were preempted by federal fuel economy standards, that California\u2019s standards weren\u2019t necessary to meet \u201ccompelling and extraordinary conditions,\u201d and that California could not show a direct connection between greenhouse gas emissions and its air pollution problems. After this withdrawal, several automakers like Honda, Ford, and BMW voluntarily agreed to continue meeting California\u2019s standards due to their existing investments and growing consumer demand for electric vehicles. In 2022, under yet another administration, the EPA reversed course again and reinstated the 2013 waiver, prompting challenges from various states and fuel industry groups who argued that California should not receive special treatment and that climate change is not a \u201ccompelling and extraordinary condition\u201d justifying state-specific standards. California, environmental organizations, and automobile manufacturers intervened to defend the EPA\u2019s decision.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit dismissed most of the claims for lack of standing, finding that challengers had not shown that their injuries were redressable by a favorable decision.",

      "eig_reasoning": "This action seeks to retrieve the petition for certiorari, which is the foundational document outlining the petitioners' arguments. \n\nTask EIG is very high (0.9) because the petition will detail the precise legal theory of standing being advanced by the fuel producers. It will explain their claimed injury (e.g., lost sales), the causal chain linking that injury to the EPA's waiver reinstatement, and how a favorable ruling would redress it. Understanding these specific arguments, and the precedents they rely on, is absolutely critical to predicting how the Court will analyze the standing question. Without this, any prediction would be based on a generalized understanding of standing doctrine rather than the actual case presented to the Court.\n\nDesign EIG is moderate (0.5) because this action represents a fundamental and highly generalizable strategy: begin case analysis by reading the petition. While not a novel technique, successfully executing and evaluating this step reinforces a core component of an effective SCOTUS prediction workflow. It confirms the utility of using targeted filters (`proceeding_title: 'petition'`) to efficiently locate the most important initial document, a practice applicable to nearly all cases.\n\nThe joint EIG is high because the action is essential for the current task and reinforces a key strategic principle for future tasks.",

U.S. Bank N.A., \n590 U.S. 538, 547 (2020).  Article III standing should \nnot be complicated here.  The question is whether a \nparty has standing to challenge a government action \nthat works by depressing the market for that party\u2019s \nproducts.  To ask the question is to answer it.  Private \nschools have standing to challenge a law prohibiting \nparents from sending their children to private school.  \nPublishers have standing to challenge a law banning \nbookstores from selling their books.  And here, produc-\ners and sellers of liquid fuels have standing to chal-\nlenge a rule requiring automakers to make cars that \nuse less liquid fuel, or none at all. \n\n2 \n \nThis lawsuit arises from the Biden Administration\u2019s \nefforts to force the electrification of the Nation\u2019s vehi-\ncle fleet.  In 2021, President Biden announced his \u201cgoal \nthat 50 percent of all new passenger cars and light \ntrucks sold in 2030 be zero-emission vehicles,\u201d as part \nof his administration\u2019s efforts to \u201caddress the climate \ncrisis.\u201d  86 Fed. Reg. 43,583, 43,583 (Aug. 5, 2021).  At \nthe time, electric vehicles made up around 4% of the \nnew automobile market.  So to fast-forward to the re-\nsult the President wanted\u2014fewer combustion-engine \nvehicles on the road and less liquid fuel consumed\u2014the \nfederal government pursued a multi-pronged strategy \nof federal and state regulation.  \nOn the state front, EPA turned to Section 209 of  \nthe Clean Air Act.  That unique provision broadly \npreempts States from adopting their own motor-vehicle \nemission standards.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(a).  But it per-\nmits California\u2014and California alone\u2014to obtain a nar-\nrow waiver from federal preemption.  Id. \u00a7 7543(b).  To \nreceive a special preemption waiver, California must \ndemonstrate that it \u201cneed[s]\u201d its own emission stand-\nards \u201cto meet compelling and extraordinary condi-\ntions.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7543(b)(1)(B).   \nFor decades, EPA granted Section 209(b) preemp-\ntion waivers to California to address the State\u2019s local \npollution problems, such as smog.  In recent years, \nhowever, different administrations have flip-flopped on \nwhether Section 209(b) permits EPA to grant Califor-\nnia a waiver to tackle global climate change.  Most rel-\nevant here is EPA\u2019s 2022 flip, in which it reinstated a \nonce-granted, once-revoked waiver for California\u2019s \n\u201cAdvanced Clean Cars\u201d program.  That program in-\ncludes a set of stringent greenhouse-gas emission \nstandards, as well as a mandate requiring automakers \nto meet a 22% zero-emission-vehicle target by model \n\n3 \n \nyear 2025.  Pet. App. 55a-57a.  California\u2019s governor \nexplained that the program works \u201cto end our reliance \non fossil fuels.\u201d1  \nPetitioners immediately challenged EPA\u2019s rein-\nstated waiver.  Petitioners are entities (and associa-\ntions of entities) that produce or sell liquid fuels and \nthe raw materials used to make them.  They challenged \nEPA\u2019s approval of California\u2019s standards as incon-\nsistent with the major-questions doctrine and the plain \ntext of Section 209(b), which allows for a special Cali-\nfornia exemption only for problems localized to and \nsolvable in California\u2014not for global issues like cli-\nmate change.  To establish their standing, petitioners \nsubmitted 14 declarations explaining that California\u2019s \nstandards target their products and will result in lower \nsales.  \nThe court of appeals held that petitioners lacked Ar-\nticle III standing.  The court theorized that vacating \nEPA\u2019s waiver, and thus eliminating California\u2019s coer-\ncive regulations, might not have any effect on car man-\nufacturers\u2019 decisions about the composition of their \nfleets, given market demand.  As a result, the court \nconcluded that petitioners had not shown that a favor-\nable decision would redress their economic injuries.  \nPet. App. 29a. \nThat cannot be right.  The entire point of Califor-\nnia\u2019s Advanced Clean Cars program is to reduce de-\nmand for petitioners\u2019 products:  the regulations are de-\nsigned to compel automakers to change the kind of ve-\nhicles they produce so as to decrease the amount of liq-\nuid fuel burned by drivers.  No one disputes that is the \naim of California\u2019s standards.  It is why EPA praised \n \n1 \nGovernor Gavin Newsom, Governor Newsom Statement on \nBiden Administration\u2019s Restoration of California\u2019s Clean Car \nWaiver (Mar. 9, 2022), https://perma.cc/T92E-2XM8. \n\n4 \n \nits waiver as a \u201ccritical step to confront the climate cri-\nsis.\u201d2  Eliminating the waiver and wiping California\u2019s \nAdvanced Clean Cars program off the books would \nthus be likely to remedy at least one dollar of petition-\ners\u2019 economic injuries.  Redressability here should not \nbe more complicated than that. \nThere are three doctrinal paths to that com-\nmonsense conclusion.  First, and most simply, redress-\nability is satisfied because a favorable decision would \n\u201cremove a regulatory hurdle\u201d to the sale of petitioners\u2019 \nproducts.  Energy Future Coal. v. EPA, 793 F.3d 141, \n144 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (Kavanaugh, J.); see Bennett \nv. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 169 (1997).  Second, even absent \nthat categorical rule, challengers to a government ac-\ntion may establish redressability by relying on the ac-\ntion\u2019s \u201cpredictable effect\u201d on third parties.  Depart-\nment of Commerce v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 768 \n(2019).  It is entirely predictable that California\u2019s reg-\nulation of automakers would \u201ccause downstream or up-\nstream economic injuries to others in the chain\u201d\u2014 \nespecially petitioners.  FDA v. Alliance for Hippo-\ncratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 384 (2024).  Third, at a mini-\nmum petitioners\u2019 injuries are redressable because \nEPA has now clarified that its waiver has no expiration \ndate.  Not even the court below doubted that setting \naside a perpetual waiver would likely affect automaker \nbehavior at some point in the future. \nArticle III\u2019s redressability requirement exists to \nalign injuries and remedies, so that litigants do not sue \nthe wrong parties and courts do not issue overly broad \n \n2 \nEPA, News Release:  What They Are Saying:  EPA Restora-\ntion of California Waiver Will Support State Climate Action, Im-\nprove Air Quality, and Advance our Electric Vehicle Future (Mar. \n11, 2022), https://perma.cc/896Q-N2X5 (EPA News Release).  \n\n5 \n \nrelief or advisory opinions.  The redressability require-\nment does not exist to block the intended targets of \ngovernment regulation from challenging the very reg-\nulations that threaten their existence, so that courts \ncan avoid deciding controversial or difficult questions.  \nThis Court should reverse. \nOPINION BELOW \nThe opinion of the court of appeals (Pet. App. \n1a-49a) is reported at 98 F.4th 288.  The EPA order \nunder review (Pet. App. 50a-285a) is available at \n87 Fed. Reg. 14,332. \nJURISDICTION \nThe court of appeals entered judgment on April 9, \n2024.  The petition for a writ of certiorari was filed on \nJuly 2, 2024, and granted on December 13, 2024.  This \nCourt has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nRelevant statutory provisions are reproduced in an \nappendix to this brief. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Statutory Background \n\u201cThe Clean Air Act regulates pollution-generating \nemissions from both stationary sources, such as facto-\nries and powerplants, and moving sources, such as \ncars, trucks, and aircraft.\u201d  Utility Air Regul. Grp.  \nv. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 308 (2014).  This case concerns  \nTitle II of the Act, which authorizes EPA to regulate \nemissions from new motor vehicles.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7521, \n7543.   \nTo effectuate a (mostly) uniform federal emissions \nregime, Section 209(a) of Title II broadly prohibits \nStates from \u201cadopt[ing] or attempt[ing] to enforce any \n\n6 \n \nstandard relating to the control of emissions from new \nmotor vehicles.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(a).  This preemption \nprovision prevents \u201can anarchic patchwork of federal \nand state regulatory programs, a prospect which \nthreatened to create nightmares for the manufactur-\ners.\u201d  Motor Equip. Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 627 F.2d 1095, \n1109 (D.C. Cir. 1979).   \nCongress created one exception to Section 209(a)\u2019s \nbroad preemption of state emission standards:  Section \n209(b), which authorizes EPA to \u201cwaive\u201d preemption \nfor certain standards adopted by California.  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7543(b).3  Congress granted California this special \nstatus because of the State\u2019s \u201cunique problems\u201d with \nsmog and other local issues caused by so-called \u201ccrite-\nria\u201d pollutants like particulate matter.  H.R. Rep. No. \n90-728, at 22 (1967).  In particular, California\u2019s atypical \n\u201cgeography and prevailing wind patterns,\u201d together \nwith its unusually large number of vehicles, made smog \na more persistent problem there than elsewhere.   \n49 Fed. Reg. 18,887, 18,890 (May 3, 1984) (citing  \n113 Cong. Rec. 30,948 (Nov. 2, 1967)). \nCongress limited California\u2019s ability to separately \nregulate emissions in several ways.  The onus is first \non California, which must \u201cdetermine[] that the State \nstandards will be, in the aggregate, at least as protec-\ntive of public health and welfare as applicable Federal \nstandards.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(b)(1).  After the State \nmakes that determination and files an application, \nEPA must deny a waiver if it finds that (1) California\u2019s \n \n3 \nSection 209(b) does not name California.  It instead makes a \npreemption waiver possible for \u201cany State\u201d that had adopted certain \nstandards \u201cprior to March 30, 1966.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(b)(1).  But as \nCongress was aware, California was the only State that met this cri-\nterion and \u201cis thus the only state eligible for a waiver.\u201d  Motor Equip. \nMfrs.

U.S. Bank N.A., \n590 U.S. 538, 547 (2020).  Article III standing should \nnot be complicated here.  The question is whether a \nparty has standing to challenge a government action \nthat works by depressing the market for that party\u2019s \nproducts.  To ask the question is to answer it.  Private \nschools have standing to challenge a law prohibiting \nparents from sending their children to private school.  \nPublishers have standing to challenge a law banning \nbookstores from selling their books.  And here, produc-\ners and sellers of liquid fuels have standing to chal-\nlenge a rule requiring automakers to make cars that \nuse less liquid fuel, or none at all. \n\n2 \n \nThis lawsuit arises from the Biden Administration\u2019s \nefforts to force the electrification of the Nation\u2019s vehi-\ncle fleet.  In 2021, President Biden announced his \u201cgoal \nthat 50 percent of all new passenger cars and light \ntrucks sold in 2030 be zero-emission vehicles,\u201d as part \nof his administration\u2019s efforts to \u201caddress the climate \ncrisis.\u201d  86 Fed. Reg. 43,583, 43,583 (Aug. 5, 2021).  At \nthe time, electric vehicles made up around 4% of the \nnew automobile market.  So to fast-forward to the re-\nsult the President wanted\u2014fewer combustion-engine \nvehicles on the road and less liquid fuel consumed\u2014the \nfederal government pursued a multi-pronged strategy \nof federal and state regulation.  \nOn the state front, EPA turned to Section 209 of  \nthe Clean Air Act.  That unique provision broadly \npreempts States from adopting their own motor-vehicle \nemission standards.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(a).  But it per-\nmits California\u2014and California alone\u2014to obtain a nar-\nrow waiver from federal preemption.  Id. \u00a7 7543(b).  To \nreceive a special preemption waiver, California must \ndemonstrate that it \u201cneed[s]\u201d its own emission stand-\nards \u201cto meet compelling and extraordinary condi-\ntions.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7543(b)(1)(B).   \nFor decades, EPA granted Section 209(b) preemp-\ntion waivers to California to address the State\u2019s local \npollution problems, such as smog.  In recent years, \nhowever, different administrations have flip-flopped on \nwhether Section 209(b) permits EPA to grant Califor-\nnia a waiver to tackle global climate change.  Most rel-\nevant here is EPA\u2019s 2022 flip, in which it reinstated a \nonce-granted, once-revoked waiver for California\u2019s \n\u201cAdvanced Clean Cars\u201d program.  That program in-\ncludes a set of stringent greenhouse-gas emission \nstandards, as well as a mandate requiring automakers \nto meet a 22% zero-emission-vehicle target by model \n\n3 \n \nyear 2025.  Pet. App. 55a-57a.  California\u2019s governor \nexplained that the program works \u201cto end our reliance \non fossil fuels.\u201d1  \nPetitioners immediately challenged EPA\u2019s rein-\nstated waiver.  Petitioners are entities (and associa-\ntions of entities) that produce or sell liquid fuels and \nthe raw materials used to make them.  They challenged \nEPA\u2019s approval of California\u2019s standards as incon-\nsistent with the major-questions doctrine and the plain \ntext of Section 209(b), which allows for a special Cali-\nfornia exemption only for problems localized to and \nsolvable in California\u2014not for global issues like cli-\nmate change.  To establish their standing, petitioners \nsubmitted 14 declarations explaining that California\u2019s \nstandards target their products and will result in lower \nsales.  \nThe court of appeals held that petitioners lacked Ar-\nticle III standing.  The court theorized that vacating \nEPA\u2019s waiver, and thus eliminating California\u2019s coer-\ncive regulations, might not have any effect on car man-\nufacturers\u2019 decisions about the composition of their \nfleets, given market demand.  As a result, the court \nconcluded that petitioners had not shown that a favor-\nable decision would redress their economic injuries.  \nPet. App. 29a. \nThat cannot be right.  The entire point of Califor-\nnia\u2019s Advanced Clean Cars program is to reduce de-\nmand for petitioners\u2019 products:  the regulations are de-\nsigned to compel automakers to change the kind of ve-\nhicles they produce so as to decrease the amount of liq-\nuid fuel burned by drivers.  No one disputes that is the \naim of California\u2019s standards.  It is why EPA praised \n \n1 \nGovernor Gavin Newsom, Governor Newsom Statement on \nBiden Administration\u2019s Restoration of California\u2019s Clean Car \nWaiver (Mar. 9, 2022), https://perma.cc/T92E-2XM8. \n\n4 \n \nits waiver as a \u201ccritical step to confront the climate cri-\nsis.\u201d2  Eliminating the waiver and wiping California\u2019s \nAdvanced Clean Cars program off the books would \nthus be likely to remedy at least one dollar of petition-\ners\u2019 economic injuries.  Redressability here should not \nbe more complicated than that. \nThere are three doctrinal paths to that com-\nmonsense conclusion.  First, and most simply, redress-\nability is satisfied because a favorable decision would \n\u201cremove a regulatory hurdle\u201d to the sale of petitioners\u2019 \nproducts.  Energy Future Coal. v. EPA, 793 F.3d 141, \n144 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (Kavanaugh, J.); see Bennett \nv. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 169 (1997).  Second, even absent \nthat categorical rule, challengers to a government ac-\ntion may establish redressability by relying on the ac-\ntion\u2019s \u201cpredictable effect\u201d on third parties.  Depart-\nment of Commerce v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 768 \n(2019).  It is entirely predictable that California\u2019s reg-\nulation of automakers would \u201ccause downstream or up-\nstream economic injuries to others in the chain\u201d\u2014 \nespecially petitioners.  FDA v. Alliance for Hippo-\ncratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 384 (2024).  Third, at a mini-\nmum petitioners\u2019 injuries are redressable because \nEPA has now clarified that its waiver has no expiration \ndate.  Not even the court below doubted that setting \naside a perpetual waiver would likely affect automaker \nbehavior at some point in the future. \nArticle III\u2019s redressability requirement exists to \nalign injuries and remedies, so that litigants do not sue \nthe wrong parties and courts do not issue overly broad \n \n2 \nEPA, News Release:  What They Are Saying:  EPA Restora-\ntion of California Waiver Will Support State Climate Action, Im-\nprove Air Quality, and Advance our Electric Vehicle Future (Mar. \n11, 2022), https://perma.cc/896Q-N2X5 (EPA News Release).  \n\n5 \n \nrelief or advisory opinions.  The redressability require-\nment does not exist to block the intended targets of \ngovernment regulation from challenging the very reg-\nulations that threaten their existence, so that courts \ncan avoid deciding controversial or difficult questions.  \nThis Court should reverse. \nOPINION BELOW \nThe opinion of the court of appeals (Pet. App. \n1a-49a) is reported at 98 F.4th 288.  The EPA order \nunder review (Pet. App. 50a-285a) is available at \n87 Fed. Reg. 14,332. \nJURISDICTION \nThe court of appeals entered judgment on April 9, \n2024.  The petition for a writ of certiorari was filed on \nJuly 2, 2024, and granted on December 13, 2024.  This \nCourt has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nRelevant statutory provisions are reproduced in an \nappendix to this brief. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Statutory Background \n\u201cThe Clean Air Act regulates pollution-generating \nemissions from both stationary sources, such as facto-\nries and powerplants, and moving sources, such as \ncars, trucks, and aircraft.\u201d  Utility Air Regul. Grp.  \nv. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 308 (2014).  This case concerns  \nTitle II of the Act, which authorizes EPA to regulate \nemissions from new motor vehicles.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7521, \n7543.   \nTo effectuate a (mostly) uniform federal emissions \nregime, Section 209(a) of Title II broadly prohibits \nStates from \u201cadopt[ing] or attempt[ing] to enforce any \n\n6 \n \nstandard relating to the control of emissions from new \nmotor vehicles.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(a).  This preemption \nprovision prevents \u201can anarchic patchwork of federal \nand state regulatory programs, a prospect which \nthreatened to create nightmares for the manufactur-\ners.\u201d  Motor Equip. Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 627 F.2d 1095, \n1109 (D.C. Cir. 1979).   \nCongress created one exception to Section 209(a)\u2019s \nbroad preemption of state emission standards:  Section \n209(b), which authorizes EPA to \u201cwaive\u201d preemption \nfor certain standards adopted by California.  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7543(b).3  Congress granted California this special \nstatus because of the State\u2019s \u201cunique problems\u201d with \nsmog and other local issues caused by so-called \u201ccrite-\nria\u201d pollutants like particulate matter.  H.R. Rep. No. \n90-728, at 22 (1967).  In particular, California\u2019s atypical \n\u201cgeography and prevailing wind patterns,\u201d together \nwith its unusually large number of vehicles, made smog \na more persistent problem there than elsewhere.   \n49 Fed. Reg. 18,887, 18,890 (May 3, 1984) (citing  \n113 Cong. Rec. 30,948 (Nov. 2, 1967)). \nCongress limited California\u2019s ability to separately \nregulate emissions in several ways.  The onus is first \non California, which must \u201cdetermine[] that the State \nstandards will be, in the aggregate, at least as protec-\ntive of public health and welfare as applicable Federal \nstandards.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(b)(1).  After the State \nmakes that determination and files an application, \nEPA must deny a waiver if it finds that (1) California\u2019s \n \n3 \nSection 209(b) does not name California.  It instead makes a \npreemption waiver possible for \u201cany State\u201d that had adopted certain \nstandards \u201cprior to March 30, 1966.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(b)(1).  But as \nCongress was aware, California was the only State that met this cri-\nterion and \u201cis thus the only state eligible for a waiver.\u201d  Motor Equip. \nMfrs. Ass\u2019n, 627 F.2d at 1100 n.1. \n\n7 \n \nprotectiveness determination is \u201carbitrary and capri-\ncious,\u201d id. \u00a7 7543(b)(1)(A); (2) California \u201cdoes not need \nsuch State standards to meet compelling and extraor-\ndinary conditions,\u201d id. \u00a7 7543(b)(1)(B); or (3) the pro-\nposed state standards are inconsistent with federal \nemission standards, id. \u00a7 7543(b)(1)(C). \nIn 1977, ten years after setting up this preemption \nframework, Congress amended the Clean Air Act to al-\nlow other States to follow California.  Any State may \nnow \u201cadopt and enforce\u201d California standards \u201cfor \nwhich a waiver has been granted,\u201d so long as the adopt-\ning State has an approved plan to attain the federal air-\nquality standards for criteria pollutants.  42 U.S.C.  \n\u00a7\u00a7 7507, 7408(a), 7409.  The upshot of this unusual \npreemption system is that EPA sets nationwide emis-\nsion standards; California may in limited circum-\nstances set more stringent ones for itself; and other \nStates may either apply EPA\u2019s standards or adopt Cal-\nifornia\u2019s, but may not set their own. \nB. Regulatory Background \n1. For decades, Section 209(b) worked as Congress \nhad envisioned.  EPA granted California waivers for \nthe State to set emission standards designed to combat \nlocal air-quality problems like smog.  See, e.g., 38 Fed. \nReg. 10,317, 10,318 (Apr. 26, 1973); 59 Fed. Reg. 48,625, \n48,626 (Sept. 22, 1994).  In recent years, however, Cal-\nifornia has sought to transform its unique preemption \nexception into a tool for targeting global climate \nchange.  It has done so through aggressive regulations \nthat limit vehicle greenhouse-gas emissions and force \nelectrification of the State\u2019s (and consequently the Na-\ntion\u2019s) vehicle fleet. \nCalifornia\u2019s efforts initially stalled.  In 2008, under \nPresident George W. Bush, EPA denied California\u2019s \nfirst application for a waiver for climate-change- \n\n8 \n \nfocused regulations.  California sought to impose \nstandards limiting greenhouse-gas emissions from new \nmotor vehicles in the State.  73 Fed. Reg. 12,156, \n12,156-12,157 (Mar. 6, 2008).  EPA rejected California\u2019s \napplication, explaining that Section 209(b)\u2019s preemp-\ntion waiver permitted California to enact standards to \naddress only \u201clocal and regional\u201d pollution where the \n\u201ccausal factors are local to California\u201d\u2014which obvi-\nously did not include global climate change.  Id. at \n12,163. \nThe day after President Obama took office, Califor-\nnia sought reconsideration of EPA\u2019s denial of its waiver \napplication.  EPA granted reconsideration, reversed it-\nself, and issued the waiver.  74 Fed. Reg. 32,744, 32,783 \n(July 8, 2009).  EPA \u201creject[ed]\u201d its prior conclusion \nthat Section 209(b) did not authorize California to \n\u201cpromulgate state standards designed to address \nglobal climate change problems\u201d and approved Califor-\nnia\u2019s first set of greenhouse-gas emission standards.  \nId. at 32,746.  In assessing the \u201cprotectiveness\u201d of Cal-\nifornia\u2019s standards, EPA relied on California\u2019s finding \nthat the standards \u201cwill result in a reduction in up-\nstream emissions (emission due to the production and \ntransportation of the fuel used by the vehicle) of green-\nhouse gas, criteria and toxic pollutants due to reduced \nfuel usage.\u201d  Id. at 32,750 n.36 (emphasis added) (cita-\ntion omitted).   \nA number of affected car dealers challenged EPA\u2019s \nwaiver decision.  Before the D.C. Circuit could rule, \nEPA \u201cpromulgated national greenhouse gas stand-\nards\u201d for model years 2012 through 2016, \u201cand Califor-\nnia amended its regulations to deem compliance with \nthose national standards as compliance with its own.\u201d  \nChamber of Commerce v. EPA, 642 F.3d 192, 206 (D.C. \nCir. 2011).  Pointing to those two developments, the \n\n9 \n \nD.C. Circuit held that the challenge to EPA\u2019s Section \n209(b) waiver was moot.  Ibid.   \n2. This case concerns California\u2019s next greenhouse-\ngas waiver request.  In 2012, California applied for a \nnew waiver to allow it to impose its \u201cAdvanced Clean \nCars\u201d program, which includes stricter standards \naimed at further curbing greenhouse-gas emissions \nfrom vehicles.  The proposed standards govern all new \npassenger cars, light-duty trucks, and medium-duty \npassenger vehicles sold in California for model year \n2015 through at least model year 2025.  California \npraised its Advanced Clean Cars standards as \u201csome of \nthe best tools we have\u201d \u201cto tackle the climate crisis\u201d by \n\u201creduc[ing] emissions\u201d and \u201cdriv[ing] technological in-\nnovation.\u201d  EPA News Release.   \nTwo components of the Advanced Clean Cars pro-\ngram are especially relevant here.  First, the program \nincludes greenhouse-gas emission standards that limit \ncarbon-dioxide emissions across fleets of vehicles.  \nManufacturers meet those limits by producing more \nelectric vehicles or by implementing technologies that \nreduce fuel consumption in combustion-engine vehi-\ncles, such as \u201celectric drive technologies\u201d and \u201cengine \nefficiency improvements.\u201d  78 Fed. Reg. 2,112, 2,136-\n2,137 (Jan. 9, 2013); see Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1961.3.  \nSecond, the program includes a \u201czero-emission vehicle\u201d \nmandate, which requires each car manufacturer to pro-\nduce and deliver for sale in California an increasing \npercentage of battery-electric or fuel-cell vehicles out \nof its overall fleet (or purchase regulatory \u201ccredits\u201d in-\nstead).  Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(b).  This man-\ndate culminates in a requirement that 22% of a manu-\nfacturer\u2019s passenger vehicles produced for model year \n2025, accounting for credits, must be zero-emission  \n\n10 \n \nvehicles\u2014up from 4.5% in model year 2018.4  Id.  \n\u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A).  California explained in its waiver ap-\nplication that the zero-emission-vehicle mandate \u201ccan \ndramatically reduce petroleum consumption . . . com-\npared to conventional technologies.\u201d  J.A. 28 (citation \nomitted). \nIn 2013, EPA granted the waiver, allowing Califor-\nnia \u201cto enforce its [Advanced Clean Cars] emission  \nregulations.\u201d  78 Fed. Reg. at 2,145.  EPA concluded \nthat California\u2019s standards met Section 209(b)\u2019s  \nrequirements\u2014including that they were \u201cneeded to meet \ncompelling and extraordinary conditions\u201d\u2014because \nthe threat of global climate change was itself \u201cextraor-\ndinary.\u201d  Id. at 2,129.  Notably, EPA credited Califor-\nnia\u2019s finding that the cost of its regulations would be \n\u201cmore than offset by consumer fuel savings over the \nlife of the vehicles.\u201d  Id. at 2,138.   \n3. Under the first Trump Administration, EPA re-\nverted to its original approach to Section 209(b).  In a \n2019 joint rulemaking with NHTSA, EPA rescinded the \n2013 preemption waiver for California\u2019s greenhouse-gas \nstandards and zero-emission-vehicle mandate, again \nreasoning that global climate change is not the kind of \n\u201cpeculiar,\u201d California-specific condition covered by \nSection 209(b).  84 Fed. Reg. 51,310, 51,328, 51,342 \n(Sept. 27, 2019).  EPA also found that California did not \n\u201cneed\u201d its standards to \u201cmeet\u201d climate-change condi-\ntions because California\u2019s standards would likely result \n \n4 \nCalifornia\u2019s regulations express this mandate as a \u201ccredit per-\ncentage requirement.\u201d  Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(b)(1).  Be-\ncause electric vehicles with longer ranges can generate more than \none credit, the exact percentage of electric vehicles can vary from \nmanufacturer to manufacturer.

On his first day in office, President Biden signed \nExecutive Order 13,990, directing EPA to \u201cconsider \nsuspending, revising, or rescinding\u201d the 2019 with-\ndrawal of California\u2019s 2013 waiver.  86 Fed. Reg. 7,037, \n7,037 (Jan. 20, 2021).  EPA dutifully reinstated Califor-\nnia\u2019s waiver, allowing the Advanced Clean Cars pro-\ngram to come back into effect.  Pet. App. 57a. \nIn reinstating the waiver, EPA flipped back to its \n2013 interpretation of Section 209(b).  Pet. App. 155a.  \nUnder that interpretation, California can obtain a \nwaiver so long as it \u201cneeds its program as a whole to \nmeet compelling and extraordinary conditions\u201d\u2014even \nif it does not actually need the specific standards at is-\nsue.  C.A. EPA Br. 84 (emphasis added); see Pet. App. \n158a.  In other words, California can tack on any emis-\nsion standards it likes to its exempt emissions \u201cpro-\ngram,\u201d so long as the State\u2019s local criteria-pollutant \nproblems \u201cpersist.\u201d  C.A. EPA Br. 66.  Applying that \npermissive reading of the statute, EPA concluded that \nthe waiver was justified primarily because California \nneeds its separate vehicle-emission program, as a \nwhole, to address its ongoing problems with criteria \npollutants.  Pet. App. 155a-162a, 186a-188a. \nEPA embraced the significance of its action, herald-\ning the waiver as a \u201ccritical step to confront the climate \ncrisis.\u201d  EPA News Release.  To date, 17 States and the \nDistrict of Columbia have adopted California\u2019s  \ngreenhouse-gas emission standards, its zero-emission-\nvehicle mandate, or both.  California Air Resources \nBoard (CARB), States that Have Adopted California\u2019s \nVehicle Regulations (June 2024), https://perma.cc/ \n\n12 \n \nM6LC-SVR8.  Together with California, those jurisdic-\ntions account for more than 40% of the Nation\u2019s new \nvehicle market.  Pet. App. 179a. \nC. Proceedings Below \n1.  Petitioners are entities (and trade associations \nwhose members include entities) that produce or sell \nliquid fuels\u2014gasoline, diesel, biodiesel, renewable die-\nsel, and ethanol\u2014and the raw materials used to make \nthem.  They promptly challenged EPA\u2019s waiver rein-\nstatement in the D.C. Circuit in May 2022, within 60 \ndays of the agency action.  Pet. App. 15a.   \nAlong with their opening brief in the court of ap-\npeals, petitioners filed 14 standing declarations that \nexplained how reinstating California\u2019s standards would \ndepress demand for liquid fuel, injuring them finan-\ncially in a variety of ways.  J.A. 120-184.  Fuel produc-\ners explained how reducing the demand for their prod-\nucts in California would lead to an unavoidable loss in \nbusiness.  J.A. 133-136.  For example, petitioner Dia-\nmond Alternative Energy explained that it sells renew-\nable diesel, a liquid fuel that can be used interchange-\nably with petroleum-derived diesel; that California \u201cac-\ncounts for almost all of the renewable diesel consumed \nin the United States\u201d; and that the standards would di-\nminish that demand.  J.A. 135. \nOther petitioners similarly established the negative \nimpact of California\u2019s standards on their bottom lines.  \nAn association of convenience stores explained that \nCalifornia\u2019s standards would mean its members\u2019 \u201cfuel-\ning stations sell less fuel\u201d and their convenience stores \nlose revenue because fewer customers \u201ccome through \n[their] stores.\u201d  J.A. 140.  And associations of corn \ngrowers noted that California\u2019s standards would drive \ndown demand for ethanol (which is blended into gaso-\nline), in turn \u201cdecreasing demand for the corn\u201d grown \n\n13 \n \nby their members to produce ethanol.  J.A. 130, 154, \n158, 167.   \nEPA did not contest petitioners\u2019 Article III stand-\ning below.  But California and other state and local gov-\nernment intervenors did.  J.A. 185-187.  They argued \nthat petitioners had not \u201cestablished any probability \nthat manufacturers would change course if EPA\u2019s \n[waiver] decision were vacated\u201d because automakers \nwere planning to increase electric-vehicle production \nfor independent reasons.  J.A. 187.  Their own inter-\nvention motion, however, attached declarations assert-\ning that \u201cadditional gasoline-fueled vehicles would be \nsold during these model years\u201d if EPA\u2019s waiver were \noverturned.  J.A. 115.   \nIn reply, petitioners explained that they had stand-\ning because vacating the waiver would remove a \u201cdirect \nregulatory impediment\u201d to their products\u2019 use.   \nJ.A. 210 (quoting Energy Future Coal., 793 F.3d at \n144).  Petitioners also pointed out that they were enti-\ntled to rely on the \u201creasonably predictable\u201d conduct of \ncar manufacturers.  Ibid.  Petitioners noted that Cali-\nfornia itself had predicted automakers would produce \nmore \u201czero-emission vehicles\u201d in response to its stand-\nards.  Ibid. (quoting C.A. J.A. 237).  And there was am-\nple record evidence that not all manufacturers had \u201cir-\nrevocably committed\u201d to electrification.  Ibid. (citing \nC.A. J.A. 477).  \nAt oral argument in September 2023, counsel for the \nstate and local government intervenors made argu-\nments sounding in mootness, not standing.  In response \nto questioning from the panel, California contended \nthat automakers could no longer change their produc-\ntion and sales plans for vehicles through model year \n2025\u2014the year in which the court apparently assumed \nthe waiver would end.  See C.A. Oral Arg. 1:10:27-\n\n14 \n \n1:10:31 (asserting that petitioners \u201cneed evidence that \nmanufacturers are going to change their product lines \nand sell different vehicles in model year 2025\u201d) (em-\nphasis added).  In reaction to that shifting theory of \njusticiability, petitioners moved to file a supplemental \nbrief and declarations explaining why their petitions \nwere not moot.  Petitioners also explained that the Cal-\nifornia standards covered by EPA\u2019s waiver purported \nto extend beyond model year 2025.  C.A. Pet. Supp. Br. \n5-6; see J.A. 50.  EPA remained conspicuously silent \nabout petitioners\u2019 standing and the temporal scope of \nthe waiver.   \n2. The court of appeals held that petitioners lack \nArticle III standing to challenge EPA\u2019s waiver.  Pet. \nApp. 19a.  Although the court declined to \u201cdefinitively \ndecide\u201d whether petitioners had established injury and \ncausation, it did not question either showing.  Id. at \n21a.   \nInstead, the court of appeals concluded that peti-\ntioners had failed to show that their injuries would be \nredressed if EPA\u2019s decision were set aside.  Pet. App. \n19a.  The court faulted petitioners for \u201cfail[ing] to point \nto any evidence affirmatively demonstrating that vaca-\ntur of the waiver would be substantially likely to\u201d \nprompt automakers to produce fewer electric vehicles \nor alter their prices so that more liquid-fuel-powered \nvehicles would be sold.  Id. at 23a.  It reasoned that \n\u201cunsupported assumptions regarding the future ac-\ntions of third-party market participants are insuffi-\ncient to establish Article III standing.\u201d  Id. at 29a.  The \ncourt also thought that the redressability inquiry was \n\u201ccomplicated by the relatively short duration of the \nwaiver,\u201d id. at 22a, though it disclaimed any finding \nthat the case had been \u201cmooted by the passage of \n\n15 \n \ntime,\u201d id. at 25a.  By hinging its decision on redressa-\nbility, the court effectively held that even if the waiver \nhad been vacated at the moment EPA reinstated it in \n2022, automakers might not have changed any produc-\ntion plans or prices before the end of model year 2025.  \nId. at 22a-24a.  The waiver was pointless the instant it \nwas reinstated. \nThe court of appeals declined to consider petition-\ners\u2019 supplemental brief and declarations.  Pet. App. \n30a.  The court reasoned that there was no \u201cgood \ncause\u201d to supplement the record.  Id. at 31a. \nD. Subsequent Developments \n1. Petitioners sought review in this Court.  In re-\nsponse, EPA explained that while the court of appeals \nhad based its redressability holding on the \u201crelatively \nshort duration of the waiver,\u201d Pet. App. 22a, in EPA\u2019s \nview the waiver does not actually sunset.  EPA Br. in \nOpp. 12-13.  According to EPA, California\u2019s greenhouse-\ngas standards continue to \u201cremain in force\u201d after model \nyear 2025, and \u201cthe waiver likewise does not terminate \nwith model-year 2025.\u201d  Id. at 13.   \nShortly thereafter, EPA took the same position in a \ndifferent regulatory action.  In proposing to approve \nCalifornia\u2019s request to include the Advanced Clean \nCars greenhouse-gas emission standards in the State\u2019s \nupdated state implementation plan, EPA credited Cal-\nifornia\u2019s July 2021 projections that those standards will \nreduce fuel consumption, and thus reduce nitrogen- \noxide and particulate-matter emissions, through at \nleast 2037.  89 Fed.

On December 17, 2024, EPA granted two new \nSection 209(b) preemption waivers for California, in-\ncluding for the \u201cAdvanced Clean Cars II\u201d program.  \n\n16 \n \nSee 90 Fed. Reg. 642, 642 (Jan. 6, 2025).  That program \n\u201cwill require all new passenger cars and light-duty \ntrucks delivered for sale in California to be zero- \nemission\u201d by 2035.

Starting \nwith model year 2026, Advanced Clean Cars II thus re-\nplaces the zero-emission-vehicle standards challenged \nhere, which apply through model year 2025.5 \nAdvanced Clean Cars II does not, however, amend \nthe challenged greenhouse-gas emission standards.  \nSee EPA Br. in Opp. 5; ACC II Decision Document 40 \nn.96.  Those standards will remain at the model-year \n2025 level of stringency for \u201csubsequent\u201d model years \nand will \u201ccontinue to be covered\u201d by the Advanced \nClean Cars I waiver \u201creinstated in 2022.\u201d  Cal.

They have Article III standing to chal-\nlenge an EPA waiver allowing California to enforce  \nvehicle-emission standards designed to reduce the con-\nsumption of liquid fuel.  The court of appeals was wrong \nto conclude otherwise. \nI. Although the court of appeals did not consider \nthe first two prongs of Article III\u2019s standing require-\nments, petitioners easily established that they have \n \n5 \nAt least some of petitioners plan to challenge EPA\u2019s recent \ndecision to grant that waiver, and one challenge has already been \nfiled.  American Free Enter. Chamber of Com. v. EPA, No. 25-106 \n(9th Cir.).  \n\n17 \n \nsuffered a concrete injury-in-fact fairly traceable to \nEPA\u2019s waiver.  \nA. EPA\u2019s preemption waiver for California\u2019s Ad-\nvanced Clean Cars program hits petitioners with a \nclassic pocketbook injury.  Petitioners produce liquid \nfuel and its component parts, so any reduction in de-\nmand for their products brings down their bottom \nlines.  Petitioners attested to their injuries in their \nmany standing declarations submitted to the court of \nappeals, in which they explained the details of their \nbusinesses and how reduced demand for liquid fuels \nlowers their revenues. \nB. EPA\u2019s waiver causes petitioners\u2019 injuries.  The \nwaiver allows California to enforce its zero-emission-\nvehicle mandate and its greenhouse-gas emission \nstandards\u2014both of which mandate the production of \nvehicles that use less or no liquid fuel.  California\u2019s \nstandards push the car market beyond what consumers \nwould ordinarily demand and automakers would ordi-\nnarily produce and sell; that is the point of the stand-\nards.  There is thus a clear causal connection between \nCalifornia\u2019s market intervention and petitioners\u2019  \nmarket-based injuries.  \nII.  Petitioners\u2019 injuries are redressable for three \nreasons.   \nA. Most simply, a decision vacating EPA\u2019s waiver \nwould remove a regulatory impediment to the use of \npetitioners\u2019 products.  As this Court has found in a va-\nriety of circumstances, the removal of the coercive ef-\nfect of government action on third parties alone suf-\nfices to establish redressability.  Challengers do not \nneed to supply additional record evidence of third par-\nties\u2019 likely reactions.  That is because such challengers \n(or their products) are being denied an opportunity to \n\n18 \n \ncompete in the marketplace, which vacating the gov-\nernment action will redress.  Redressability, after all, \nfocuses on the match between the judicial relief re-\nquested and the injury suffered\u2014and when challeng-\ners seek to vacate a rule targeting their products, the \nmatch is perfect.   \nB. Even if this Court declines to adopt that categor-\nical rule, petitioners can at least establish redressabil-\nity by relying on the predictable effects of the chal-\nlenged government action on third parties.  This Court \nhas time and again distinguished between speculative \nand predictable third-party responses to a judicial de-\ncision.  When a third-party response is speculative, rec-\nord evidence may be required to establish redressabil-\nity.  But when a third-party response is predictable, no \nmore is needed than a dose of common sense.   \nIt is not just predictable but obvious that allowing \nCalifornia to limit vehicles\u2019 emissions will result in less \nfuel consumption.  California\u2019s standards require that \nautomakers produce and sell more fuel-efficient cars \nand fewer cars that run on liquid fuel.  If EPA\u2019s waiver \nis set aside and California\u2019s standards are preempted, \nat least one automaker will choose to sell more vehicles \nwith lower fuel efficiency or more combustion-engine \nvehicles.  It is difficult to imagine that the parties and \ntheir many amici would have litigated this case for \nnearly three years and counting if that were not true.   \nC.  The court of appeals rejected these two straight-\nforward theories of redressability.  Instead, it imposed \nextraordinary burdens on entities indirectly affected \nby agency action, effectively requiring evidence from \nthe directly regulated entities themselves.  The court \nalso raised timing concerns that conflated redressabil-\nity and mootness, with significant consequences.  Its \nmisplaced redressability label flipped the burden of \n\n19 \n \nproof from the government to petitioners, while leaving \npetitioners without recourse to established mootness \nexceptions.   \nIf left uncorrected, the decision below would have \npractical repercussions as serious as its doctrinal er-\nrors.  A heightened redressability requirement would \nlock the courthouse doors to numerous traditional chal-\nlengers to agency action, so long as the targets of reg-\nulation have different interests than directly regulated \nparties (as is often the case).  It would also encourage \nagencies to intentionally act on shorter time horizons \nto shield their actions from review, and it would cut off \nreview of the most politically sensitive actions.  \nD.  At a minimum, petitioners\u2019 injuries are redress-\nable even under the court of appeals\u2019 mistaken reason-\ning, because EPA has now conceded that its waiver for \ncertain California standards does not sunset.  The \ncourt of appeals was concerned about what it viewed as \nthe relatively short four-year duration of the waiver.  \nBut as EPA has since explained to this Court, its \nwaiver does not expire unless California changes its \nstandards, and California has never amended its \ngreenhouse-gas standards.  Put differently, the \nwaiver\u2019s effects do not expire after model year 2025.  \nThere thus can be no plausible dispute that vacating \nthe waiver will have some effect on automaker behavior \nat some point in the future.  Standards that regulate \nmarket allocation forever are all but guaranteed to \nhave at least one dollar of economic impact. \nARGUMENT \nTo demonstrate Article III standing, a plaintiff \nmust show that he suffered a concrete injury, that the \ninjury is fairly traceable to the challenged action, and \nthat the \u201cinjury will be redressed by a favorable deci-\nsion.\u201d  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 \n\n20 \n \n(1992) (citation omitted).  Taken collectively, these re-\nquirements ensure that federal courts decide only \u201cthe \nrights of individuals,\u201d and maintain \u201ctheir proper  \nfunction in a limited and separated government.\u201d  \nTransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413, 423 (2021) \n(citations omitted). \nWhen a plaintiff is directly regulated by a chal-\nlenged agency action, \u201cthere is ordinarily little ques-\ntion\u201d that he has standing to challenge the action.  \nLujan, 504 U.S. at 561.  By contrast, when a \u201cplaintiff \nis not himself the object of the government action or \ninaction he challenges, standing is . . . ordinarily \u2018sub-\nstantially more difficult\u2019 to establish.\u201d  Id. at 562 (cita-\ntion omitted).  Nevertheless, \u201centire classes of admin-\nistrative litigation\u201d have \u201ctraditionally been brought \nby unregulated\u201d but \u201cadversely affected parties.\u201d  Cor-\nner Post, Inc. v. Board of Governors of the Fed. Rsrv. \nSys., 603 U.S. 799, 827, 833 (2024) (Kavanaugh, J., con-\ncurring); see id. at 833-837 (collecting cases).  Those \nchallenges make particular sense where government \nregulations target someone \u201cdownstream or upstream\u201d \nfrom the entities that the regulations directly govern.  \nAlliance for Hippocratic Medicine, 602 U.S. at 384. \nPetitioners here are not directly regulated, but they \nare the prime targets of government regulation.  They \neasily satisfy the three components of Article III \nstanding.  Petitioners produce, refine, or sell liquid \nfuels and the raw materials used to produce them.  \nThey promptly challenged EPA\u2019s waiver, which allows \nCalifornia to impose otherwise-preempted standards \nthat are designed to reduce the use of liquid fuel\u2014 \nhitting petitioners with a classic pocketbook injury.  \nSetting aside EPA\u2019s waiver would mean that California \n\n21 \n \ncannot enforce its standards, ending the artificial de-\npression of demand for petitioners\u2019 products.  This case \nshould be no more complicated than that. \nI. PETITIONERS SUFFERED AN INJURY-IN-\nFACT CAUSED BY EPA\u2019S ACTION \n \nThe court of appeals skipped the injury and causa-\ntion prongs of standing, resting its holding entirely on \nredressability grounds.  That may be because petition-\ners easily satisfy the first two prongs of the Article III \nstanding analysis.  Petitioners suffered concrete and \nparticularized injuries, and those injuries are fairly \ntraceable to EPA\u2019s waiver decision. \nA. Petitioners \nSuffered \nClassic \nPocketbook  \nInjuries \n \nPetitioners include businesses at every stage of the \nsupply chain for liquid fuels.  They grow the raw mate-\nrials for liquid fuel, produce and refine liquid fuel, and \nsell liquid fuel at gas stations and convenience stores.  \nSee, e.g., J.A. 127-128 (producers of corn to make etha-\nnol), 131-132 (producers and sellers of renewable liquid \nfuels), 138-139 (owners of gas stations and convenience \nstores).  Petitioners differ in the exact nature of their \nbusinesses, but they all have one thing in common:  they \nprofit from participating in the liquid-fuels market. \nBy design, California\u2019s standards operate to reduce \nthe liquid-fuels market and thus injure those who par-\nticipate in it.  That is because the Advanced Clean Cars \nstandards aim to reduce emissions by reducing liquid \nfuel combustion in vehicles.  To comply, manufacturers \nmust produce more electric vehicles, subsidize the pro-\nduction of electric vehicles, implement technologies \nthat improve the fuel efficiency of vehicles, or some \ncombination thereof.  See J.A. 8-9 (identifying possible \ncompliance technologies); 78 Fed. Reg. at 2,136-2,137 \n\n22 \n \n(same).  The standards thus force automakers to pro-\nduce a fleet of vehicles that use significantly less liquid \nfuel or no liquid fuel at all.  In fact, California repeat-\nedly represented as much when applying for the chal-\nlenged waiver.  J.A. 35, 49.  Fewer cars that run on liq-\nuid fuel, or more cars that run on less liquid fuel, means \nless liquid fuel sold.  And suppressing demand for a \nparty\u2019s product is the prototypical monetary injury-in-\nfact.  See TransUnion, 594 U.S. at 425; United States \nv. Texas, 599 U.S. 670, 676 (2023).   \nPetitioners explained these prototypical pocketbook \ninjuries in the 14 standing declarations they submitted \nwith their opening brief below.  Those declarations de-\ntail how petitioners participate in the liquid-fuel supply \nchain and how the reduction in demand caused by Cal-\nifornia\u2019s standards would financially injure their busi-\nnesses.  See J.A. 120-184.  For example, producers ex-\nplained that a \u201csignificant reduction in California\u2019s gas-\noline demand, as contemplated by the [Advanced Clean \nCars] I program, will detrimentally impact Valero\u2019s \nbusiness.\u201d  J.A. 147.  And they confirmed their inability \nto \u201cavoid financial harm\u201d by shifting production out-\nside of California or by repurposing their products.  \nJ.A. 170; see J.A. 144-145, 147-150.  As these declara-\ntions underscore, petitioners have a concrete stake in \nthe outcome:  their businesses are on the line.  \u201cThis is \na classic pocketbook injury sufficient to give [them] \nstanding.\u201d  Tyler v. Hennepin Cnty., 598 U.S. 631, 636 \n(2023).   \nB. Petitioners\u2019 Injuries Are Fairly Traceable To \nEPA\u2019s Waiver \nPetitioners likewise satisfy Article III\u2019s causation \nrequirement.  To demonstrate causation, a party must \nestablish a \u201ccausal connection between the injury and \nthe conduct complained of.\u201d  Susan B. Anthony List v. \n\n23 \n \nDriehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 158 (2014) (citation omitted).  \nThat \u201crequires only that the plaintiff\u2019s injury be fairly \ntraceable to the defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d  Lexmark Int\u2019l, \nInc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, \n134 n.6 (2014).  The connection between petitioners\u2019 in-\njuries and EPA\u2019s waiver is straightforward here.  The \nwaiver allows California\u2019s greenhouse-gas emission \nstandards and zero-emission-vehicle mandate to take \neffect, when federal law would otherwise preempt \nthem.  Pet. App. 55a-57a.  Those portions of the Ad-\nvanced Clean Cars program operate by requiring in-\ncreased fuel economy or full electrification, thereby de-\npressing demand for petitioners\u2019 products.   \nPetitioners\u2019 injuries are attributable to government \nregulation, not solely to existing consumer demand for \nelectric vehicles.  The entire purpose of California\u2019s \nstandards is to go beyond what market forces would \nnaturally produce.  That is why California described its \nregulations as \u201ccritical\u201d for \u201cemissions reductions\u201d and \n\u201ccritical for incentivizing production and deployment of \nzero-emission vehicles.\u201d  J.A. 66.  Those standards in-\nclude a 22% zero-emission-vehicle mandate, far above \nwhat the market had naturally produced.  Cal. Code \nRegs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(b)(1); see David Gohlke et al., As-\nsessment of Light-Duty Plug-in Electric Vehicles in \nthe United States, 2010\u20132021, at 1 (Nov. 1, 2022), \nhttps://perma.cc/Y6VE-2QB5.  Because California\u2019s \nstandards aim to reduce liquid-fuel use by increasing \nthe number of electric or fuel-efficient vehicles beyond \nmarket demand, petitioners have \u201clink[ed] their as-\nserted injuries to the government\u2019s regulation . . . of \nsomeone else.\u201d  Alliance for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. \nat 382. \n\n24 \n \nII. PETITIONERS\u2019 INJURIES ARE REDRESSABLE \nBecause petitioners suffered classic pocketbook in-\njuries caused by a federal regulatory action, and be-\ncause they challenged that action almost immediately, \nit would be unusual if petitioners\u2019 injuries were not re-\ndressable.  Redressability requires only that a favora-\nble judicial judgment would \u201ctake steps to slow or re-\nduce\u201d the plaintiff\u2019s injury.  Massachusetts v. EPA, \n549 U.S. 497, 525 (2007).  Thus, when a plaintiff asserts \nan economic injury, she establishes redressability if a \nfavorable decision would put even one dollar back in \nher pocket.  Uzuegbunam v. Preczewski, 592 U.S. 279, \n291 (2021).  That is no high bar.   \nThe bar is easily cleared here.  Most simply, the \nchallenged government action creates a legal hurdle to \nthe use of petitioners\u2019 products, so setting aside that \ngovernment action would provide redress.  And were \nthat not enough, petitioners can always rely on the \n\u201cpredictable effect\u201d of regulation on third parties to es-\ntablish redressability.  Department of Commerce,  \n588 U.S. at 768.  It is certainly predictable that an  \nelectric-vehicle mandate will result in fewer liquid-\nfuel-powered vehicles on the roads; that is the man-\ndate\u2019s raison d\u2019\u00eatre.  At a minimum, the decision below \nmust be vacated because it was premised on a factual \nmistake.  EPA has since confirmed that the waiver al-\nlowing California to target petitioners\u2019 products has no \ndefinite end date.  An agency action limiting the use of \npetitioners\u2019 products in perpetuity must have some \nreal-world effect. \n\n25 \n \nA. Petitioners Have Established Redressability \nBecause They Are Challenging A Regulatory \nHurdle To The Use Of Their Products \nCalifornia\u2019s Advanced Clean Cars standards re-\nquire car manufacturers to produce an increasing per-\ncentage of vehicles that consume less liquid fuel or no \nliquid fuel at all.  Because the standards impose a new \nlegal barrier to the use of petitioners\u2019 products\u2014and \nindeed reducing consumption of petitioners\u2019 products \nis how the standards achieve their intended purpose\u2014 \nvacating EPA\u2019s waiver would provide petitioners with \nredress.  Article III requires nothing more. \n1. Removing \nthe \ncoercive \neffect \nof  \ngovernment standards provides redress \na.  This Court has long recognized that removing the \n\u201cdeterminative or coercive effect\u201d of government reg-\nulation \u201cupon the action of someone else\u201d is sufficient \nto establish redressability.  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 169.  \nThus, if a plaintiff can establish the existence of a reg-\nulatory impediment that prevents its product from be-\ning used, that is enough. \nIn Bennett, this Court made clear that the removal \nof an adverse agency action\u2014even one that operates on \na third party\u2014provides redress to individuals injured \nby that action.  There, a group of ranchers challenged \na biological opinion issued by the U.S. Fish and Wild-\nlife Service, which advised the Bureau of Reclamation \nto maintain minimum water levels at several reservoirs \nthat the ranchers used.  520 U.S. at 159-160.  The gov-\nernment argued that Article III\u2019s causation and re-\ndressability requirements were not met because it was \npossible that the Bureau would independently opt to \nreduce the ranchers\u2019 access to water, even without the \nchallenged biological opinion.  Id. at 168.  This Court \nunanimously disagreed, recognizing that the biological \n\n26 \n \nopinion had a \u201cvirtually determinative effect\u201d on the \nBureau\u2019s decisions because disregarding it could ex-\npose the Bureau and its employees to liability under \nthe Endangered Species Act.  Id. at 170.  The removal \nof the \u201ccoercive\u201d force of the biological opinion on the \nBureau alone established redressability.  Id. at 171.  \nThe ranchers did not need to provide additional evi-\ndence to show that their injury was \u201cfairly traceable\u201d \nto the opinion or that it would \u201clikely be redressed\u201d if \nthe opinion were withdrawn.  Id. at 169-171. \nBennett made explicit what had been assumed in a \nlong line of this Court\u2019s cases resolving challenges to \ngovernment action brought by indirectly regulated \nparties.  For example, this Court heard a suit by pri-\nvate schools challenging as unconstitutional an Oregon \nlaw making it a crime for parents to send their children \nto private school.  Pierce v. Society of the Sisters of the \nHoly Names of Jesus and Mary, 268 U.S. 510, 534 \n(1925).  Although the parents were directly regulated, \nthe private schools were the target\u2014and there was no \ndoubt that they could bring the lawsuit.  The Court did \nnot require the schools to provide evidence that par-\nents would send their children to those schools absent \nOregon\u2019s \u201cunwarranted compulsion.\u201d  Id. at 535.  Simi-\nlarly, in CBS v. United States, this Court found that the \ntelevision network CBS could sue to challenge regula-\ntions denying a license to any broadcasting station that \nconducted certain business with CBS.  316 U.S. 407, \n421-423 (1942).  The Court did not call for evidence that \nlicensees would change course and partner with CBS if \nthe regulations were rescinded; it was enough that po-\ntential licensees intended to comply with the regula-\ntions.  Id. at 422.  \nb. The rule that removal of the \u201cunwarranted com-\npulsion\u201d of government action satisfies redressability \n\n27 \n \ncomports with the original purpose of the redressabil-\nity requirement.  As this Court has repeatedly ex-\nplained, redressability ensures that there is a \u201crela-\ntionship between \u2018the judicial relief requested\u2019 and the \n\u2018injury\u2019 suffered.\u201d  California v. Texas, 593 U.S. 659, \n660 (2021) (quoting Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 753 \nn.19 (1984)).  It thus prevents litigants from suing par-\nties or challenging laws that have \u201cnothing to do with\u201d \ntheir injuries, or requesting overly broad relief.  Id. at \n675; see Haaland v. Brackeen, 599 U.S. 255, 293 (2023) \n(redressability not established because \u201cstate officials \nwho implement [the challenged statute] are not parties \nto the suit\u201d).  And it similarly prevents courts from is-\nsuing \u201cadvisory opinion[s]\u201d that amount to nothing \nmore than \u201ca general authority to conduct oversight,\u201d \nparticularly \u201cof decisions of the elected branches of \nGovernment.\u201d  California, 593 U.S. at 673; see Brack-\neen, 599 U.S. at 294.   \nWhen a plaintiff asks a court to remove a coercive \ngovernment regulation, there is no mismatch between \ninjury and remedy.  Indeed, there is a perfect correla-\ntion between the individual\u2019s injury (which flows from \na constraint that may artificially depress market de-\nmand) and the remedy for that injury (removing the \ngovernment constraint).  And to the extent there are \ndistinct concerns about attenuation, those concerns are \nhoused in other doctrines, such as proximate-cause lim-\nitations that exclude plaintiffs whose injuries are \u201ctoo \nremote\u201d from the conduct a statute prohibits.  See, e.g., \nLexmark, 572 U.S. at 133.  As far as redressability is \nconcerned, however, Article III\u2019s demands are the \nsame whether the plaintiff is directly or indirectly reg-\nulated.   \nc. This Court should confirm the simple, clear rule \nthat the removal of a regulatory hurdle to the use of a \n\n28 \n \nchallenger\u2019s product satisfies Article III\u2019s redressabil-\nity requirement\u2014no matter whether the regulation is \nformally applied to a third party.  That rule has the \nbenefit of comporting not just with traditional under-\nstandings of redressability but also with basic logic.  As \nthen-Judge Kavanaugh put it, if \u201cthe Government pro-\nhibits or impedes Company A from using Company B\u2019s \nproduct,\u201d there is \u201cordinarily little question\u201d that Com-\npany B has standing, since Company B\u2019s product is the \nvery \u201cobject\u201d of the regulation.  Energy Future Coal., \n793 F.3d at 144.  Company B is being deprived of the \n\u201copportunity to compete in the marketplace,\u201d so a fa-\nvorable judicial decision will provide at least some re-\ndress.  Ibid.  Or as this Court has succinctly recognized, \nif a regulatory program causes an injury in fact, \u201c[i]t \nfollows\u201d that \u201ca judicial decree directing [the govern-\nment] to discontinue its program would \u2018redress\u2019 the \ninjury.\u201d  Northeastern Fla. Chapter of Associated Gen. \nConts. of Am. v. City of Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656, 666 \nn.5 (1993).  \n2. California\u2019s standards impose a new  \nregulatory hurdle to the use of petitioners\u2019 \nproducts  \nThe above rule\u2014that removal of a regulatory hurdle \nto the use of a challenger\u2019s product satisfies Article III\u2019s \nredressability requirement\u2014resolves this case.  Peti-\ntioners\u2019 injuries arise from the \u201cdeterminative or coer-\ncive effect\u201d of California\u2019s standards (allowed to go into \neffect by EPA) on third-party automakers.  Bennett, \n520 U.S. at 169.  Although California\u2019s standards do not \ndirectly impose obligations on petitioners, the stand-\nards require somebody else to make vehicles that use \nless of petitioners\u2019 products.  It should be irrelevant \nthat the requirement technically operates on automak-\ners; the government is simply reducing the use of liquid \n\n29 \n \nfuel by regulating the assembly line rather than the gas \npump.   \nAgain, the Advanced Clean Cars program includes \ntwo mechanisms that directly prevent market partici-\npants from consuming as much of petitioners\u2019 products \nas they otherwise might.  First, California\u2019s zero- \nemission-vehicle mandate requires automakers to pro-\nduce an increasing percentage of vehicles that consume \nno liquid fuel.  Second, California\u2019s greenhouse-gas \nemission standards require automakers to produce ve-\nhicles with increased fuel efficiency\u2014with a corre-\nsponding reduction in the use of liquid fuel.  Under ei-\nther mechanism, California\u2019s standards pose a legal \nbarrier to the use of petitioners\u2019 products.  In fact, Cal-\nifornia predicted that \u201c[t]he oil and gas industry, fuel \nproviders, and service stations are likely to be the most \nadversely affected by the proposed Advanced Clean \nCars program due to the substantial reductions in de-\nmand for gasoline.\u201d  J.A. 13.  Petitioners are therefore \nbeing denied the \u201copportunity to compete in the mar-\nketplace\u201d without California\u2019s interference.  Energy \nFuture Coal., 793 F.3d at 144.  Under this Court\u2019s cases \nand a traditional understanding of redressability, no \nmore record evidence is needed. \nB. Petitioners Have Established Redressability  \nBecause They Can Rely On The Predictable  \nEffect Of Emission Standards  \nEven if this Court does not apply a categorical rule \nbased on the removal of a regulatory hurdle to petition-\ners\u2019 products, petitioners can still establish redressa-\nbility through case-specific inferences about third-\nparty conduct.  Article III does not demand certainty; \nit requires that the requested remedy will likely re-\ndress petitioners\u2019 injuries.  That standard is satisfied \n\n30 \n \nhere, where the behavior of third parties is predictable \nrather than speculative. \n1. Litigants can rely on common sense  \nand basic economics to demonstrate  \nredressability \nIndirectly regulated parties have traditionally sat-\nisfied Article III\u2019s redressability requirement so long \nas the conduct of directly regulated parties is reasona-\nbly predictable.  If it is, then a favorable judicial deci-\nsion would \u201clikely\u201d redress injuries inflicted as a result \nof that third party\u2019s action\u2014which is what Article III \nrequires.  Davis v. Federal Election Comm\u2019n, 554 U.S. \n724, 733 (2008).  A contrary rule would shield from ju-\ndicial scrutiny many government actions aimed at indi-\nrectly regulated, but undeniably injured, parties. \na. When a plaintiff\u2019s injury arises from \u201cthe unfet-\ntered choices made by independent actors,\u201d a plaintiff \nmust show that the third party will behave in such a \nway as to \u201cpermit redressability of injury.\u201d  Lujan, \n504 U.S. at 562 (citation omitted).  In applying that \nrule, this Court has repeatedly distinguished between \nreliance on speculative third-party actions and reliance \non predictable third-party behavior.  Record evidence \nis required to bolster the former but not the latter. \nWhen third-party behavior is predictable, com-\nmonsense inferences can suffice.  This Court held as \nmuch in Department of Commerce, 588 U.S. 752.  \nThere, the Court concluded that a group of States with \na disproportionate share of noncitizens had standing to \nchallenge the inclusion of a citizenship question in the \ncensus.  Id. at 767.  Although the States\u2019 harm \u201cde-\npend[ed] on the independent action of third parties\u201d\u2014\nthe noncitizens living in those States\u2014it was \u201cpredict-\nable\u201d that noncitizens would be \u201creluctan[t] to answer \n\n31 \n \na citizenship question\u201d and thus potentially not re-\nspond at all.  Id. at 767-768.  The depressed population \ncount, in turn, could result in a diversion of resources \nfrom the State challengers.  Id. at 767.  The Court ac-\ncepted that predictable chain of events based on com-\nmon sense and historical practice.  Id. at 768.  It did not \nrequire the challengers to gather, for example, affida-\nvits from noncitizens asserting that they would not re-\nspond to a census with a citizenship question. \nAlthough Department of Commerce focused on cau-\nsation, its reasoning applies equally to Article III\u2019s re-\ndressability requirement.  After all, \u201ccausation and re-\ndressability . . . are often \u2018flip sides of the same coin.\u2019  \u201d  \nAlliance for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 380 (quot-\ning Sprint Commc\u2019ns Co. v. APCC Servs., Inc.,  \n554 U.S. 269, 288 (2008)).  For that reason, lower courts \nhave found Article III\u2019s redressability requirement \nsatisfied based on the predictable response of a third \nparty to a judicial decision in the plaintiff\u2019s favor.  See, \ne.g., Skyline Wesleyan Church v. California Dep\u2019t of \nManaged Health Care, 968 F.3d 738, 749-750 (9th Cir. \n2020). \nIndeed, this Court applied similar reasoning in \nMassachusetts v. EPA, when it determined that Mas-\nsachusetts satisfied Article III\u2019s redressability re-\nquirement by looking to the predictable effect on global \nclimate change of requiring EPA to regulate  \ngreenhouse-gas emissions.  549 U.S. at 525-526.  In \nfinding redressability, the Court attached \u201cconsidera-\nble significance\u201d to EPA\u2019s own statements about its \nregulatory priorities, which suggested that ordering \nEPA to set emission standards would cause fewer ve-\nhicle emissions and therefore redress petitioners\u2019 inju-\nries.  Id. at 526.  That is, the Court found that an effect \n\n32 \n \nis predictable, and sufficient to establish redressabil-\nity, when the agency itself presupposes that effect. \nb. By contrast, redressability cannot rest on mere \nspeculation.  This Court has articulated three circum-\nstances where relief is too speculative to satisfy the de-\nmands of Article III.  None is applicable here. \nFirst, when a plaintiff\u2019s causation or redressability \ntheory relies on \u201ccounterintuitive\u201d assumptions about \nthird-party behavior, the plaintiff may need to support \nthat theory with \u201cstronger evidence.\u201d  California, \n593 U.S. at 678.  That was true in California, where the \nState challengers failed to establish redressability be-\ncause they sought to attack a government healthcare \nmandate that lacked any enforcement mechanism.  The \nCourt found it \u201ccounterintuitive\u201d \u201cthat an unenforcea-\nble mandate will cause [the States\u2019] residents to enroll \nin valuable benefits programs that they would other-\nwise forgo,\u201d so the Court required \u201cstronger evidence\u201d \nthat the mandate would actually have such an effect.  \nIbid. \nSecond, redressability may also be too speculative if \na plaintiff relies on a chain of events with thin links be-\ntween them.  For example, in Alliance for Hippocratic \nMedicine, the plaintiffs relied on overly \u201ccomplicated \ncausation theories\u201d to establish their standing to sue.  \n602 U.S. at 386.  The plaintiff doctors claimed that they \nsuffered increased costs or potential liability as a result \nof the FDA\u2019s decisions to relax mifepristone regula-\ntions.  Id. at 387.  But the doctors would first have to \nexperience \u201can increase in the number of pregnant \nwomen seeking treatment\u201d for mifepristone complica-\ntions, and then those treatments would have to result \nin the doctors\u2019 being \u201csued or required to pay higher \ninsurance costs.\u201d  Id. at 391-392.  More \u201cevidence\u201d was \n\n33 \n \nneeded to prove that this chain of events was likely to \noccur.  Id. at 391.  \nThird, if the legal impact of a judicial decision is un-\nclear, redressability may be too speculative.  That was \ntrue in Brackeen, where the challenged statute was en-\nforced by non-party state officials, not the federal de-\nfendants.  As a result, this Court\u2019s opinion could at best \nserve \nas \na \n\u201cpersuasive . . . advisory \nopinion[].\u201d  \n599 U.S. at 294 (citations omitted).  A similar problem \nexisted in United States v. Texas, where the challenged \nguidelines \u201cmerely advise[d] federal officials about \nhow to exercise their prosecutorial discretion when it \ncomes to deciding which aliens to prioritize for arrest \nand removal.\u201d  599 U.S. at 691 (Gorsuch, J., concurring \nin the judgment).  And in Murthy v. Missouri, the gov-\nernment action had concluded by the time the suit was \nbrought, so a judicial decision also served a purely ad-\nvisory function.  603 U.S. 43, 72-73 (2024).  In all those \ncases, additional evidence was required to establish re-\ndressability not because the federal government was \nregulating a third party but because it was not actively \nregulating at all. \nc. The distinction between predictable effects \n(which do not require record evidence) and counterin-\ntuitive or unlikely effects (which do) is especially im-\nportant for lawsuits brought by indirectly regulated \nparties. \nThe Court reinforced this point just last Term in Al-\nliance for Hippocratic Medicine.  Even as it disap-\nproved the particular plaintiffs\u2019 standing theories, the \nCourt acknowledged \u201ca variety of familiar circum-\nstances where government regulation of a third-party \nindividual or business may be likely to cause injury in \nfact to an unregulated plaintiff.\u201d  602 U.S. at 384.  For \nexample, it is predictable that government regulation \n\n34 \n \nof one business \u201cmay cause downstream or upstream \neconomic injuries to others in the chain.\u201d  Ibid. (citing \nNational Credit Union Admin. v. First Nat\u2019l Bank & \nTrust Co., 522 U.S. 479, 488 n.4 (1998); General Motors \nCorp. v. Tracy, 519 U.S. 278, 286-287 (1997); Barlow  \nv. Collins, 397 U.S. 159, 162-164 (1970); and Associa-\ntion of Data Processing Serv. Orgs., Inc. v. Camp, 397 \nU.S. 150, 152 (1970)).  And it is predictable that when \nthe government \u201cregulates parks, national forests, or \nbodies of water,\u201d it will affect the users of those natural \nresources.  Id. at 385 (citing Summers v. Earth Island \nInst., 555 U.S. 488, 494 (2009)).  \u201cThe list goes on.\u201d  \nIbid. (citing Department of Commerce, 588 U.S. at 766-\n768).  In all such cases, plaintiffs rely on \u201ca predictable \nchain of events leading from the government action to \nthe asserted injury.\u201d  Ibid. \n2. Automakers would predictably adjust \ntheir fleets if EPA\u2019s waiver were vacated  \nThe effect of EPA\u2019s waiver on automakers is more \nthan predictable; it is obvious.  EPA\u2019s waiver puts in \nplace California\u2019s Advanced Clean Cars standards.  \nThose standards are specifically designed to reduce the \nnumber of conventional, liquid-fuel-powered vehicles \nthat would otherwise be produced.  J.A. 110, 115-116.  \nAnd no one has disputed that automakers have histor-\nically responded to California\u2019s greenhouse-gas emis-\nsion and zero-emission-vehicle standards by selling \nfewer conventional vehicles.  See 78 Fed. Reg. at 2,141-\n2,142.  After all, if that were not the historical response, \nCalifornia \u201cwould presumably not bother with such ef-\nforts.\u201d  Massachusetts, 549 U.S. at 526 (citation omit-\nted).   \nIn continuing to defend its standards, California has \nconfirmed that it is intentionally trying to reduce de-\n\n35 \n \nmand for petitioners\u2019 products.  California has repeat-\nedly told EPA that the State wants its greenhouse-gas \nemission standards to reduce the emissions that come \nfrom burning liquid fuel.  It has explained that its \nstandards increase the number of electric vehicles in \nuse, thereby avoiding the \u201cproduction and delivery of \ngasoline.\u201d  J.A. 84.  And California represented to EPA \nthat the standards were \u201ccritical not just for immediate \nemissions reductions but also\u201d for \u201cgreater emission \nreductions in the future.\u201d  J.A. 66.  If regulations are \n\u201ccritical\u201d in the government\u2019s telling, surely litigants \ncan reasonably predict that they will have some effect. \nThe bottom line here is unavoidable.  If EPA\u2019s \nwaiver is vacated, California can no longer force au-\ntomakers to make more electric vehicles or higher- \nefficiency vehicles than they would otherwise produce \nin response to market forces.  Free of government in-\nterference, automakers will respond to market de-\nmand, including by making more vehicles that run on \nmore liquid fuel or by adjusting their distribution plans \nor prices in ways that will result in more liquid-fuel-\npowered vehicle sales.  That theory of automaker be-\nhavior is far from speculative.  It is Economics 101. \nC. The \nCourt \nOf \nAppeals\u2019 \nRedressability  \nAnalysis Is Wrong \nUnder the principles discussed above, the redressa-\nbility inquiry should have been straightforward in this \ncase.  Vacating EPA\u2019s waiver would remove a legal ob-\nstacle to the use of petitioners\u2019 products, and au-\ntomaker behavior is predictable in any event.  Yet the \ncourt of appeals blinded itself to the obvious.  It con-\ncluded that petitioners do not have Article III standing \nby creating artificially high evidentiary barriers to es-\ntablishing redressability.  In so doing, the court made \n\n36 \n \nit nearly impossible for many parties indirectly af-\nfected by government action to secure judicial relief, \nand created incentives for government gamesmanship. \n1. The decision below contradicts this \nCourt\u2019s precedents and common sense  \na. The court of appeals overstated petitioners\u2019 bur-\nden to establish redressability.  Although the court \nacknowledged that it was \u201cpossible\u201d automakers would \nchange their plans and sell more liquid-fuel-powered \nvehicles or vehicles that use more liquid fuel if EPA\u2019s \nwaiver were vacated, it faulted petitioners for failing to \nsupply \u201crecord evidence\u201d to that effect, such as \u201caddi-\ntional affidavits.\u201d  Pet. App. 24a (internal quotation \nmarks omitted).  In the court\u2019s view, it was just as \nlikely that California\u2019s standards have no real-world \nimpact because some manufacturers are already sell-\ning \u201cmore qualifying vehicles in California than the \nState\u2019s standards require.\u201d  Id. at 28a (emphasis omit-\nted) (quoting J.A. 202).  And the court believed that \n\u201cunsupported assumptions regarding the future ac-\ntions of third-party market participants are insuffi-\ncient to establish Article III standing\u201d\u2014full stop.  Id. \nat 29a (internal quotation marks omitted). \nAs explained, the court of appeals\u2019 categorical evi-\ndentiary demand is doubly wrong.  First, it departs \nfrom Bennett and the D.C. Circuit\u2019s own precedent es-\ntablishing that the removal of a regulatory hurdle to \nthe use of the challenger\u2019s product satisfies redressa-\nbility.  See pp. 25-29, supra.  Indeed, the court of ap-\npeals did not even acknowledge its precedent holding \nthat \u201cremov[ing] a regulatory hurdle\u201d to the use of fuel \nsuffices to establish redressability.  Energy Future \nCoal., 793 F.3d at 144.  And second, petitioners were at \nleast entitled to rely on common sense:  automakers \nwould predictably produce more vehicles that use more \n\n37 \n \nliquid fuel if no longer subject to standards mandating \nthe production of certain quantities of electric or fuel-\nefficient vehicles.  See pp. 29-35, supra.   \nNor could the court of appeals rely on supposed \nmarket forces to justify its heightened redressability \nburden.  The limited evidence the court invoked sup-\nported the opposite conclusion.  The court relied on \nCalifornia\u2019s declaration explaining that automakers \nhad sold more electric vehicles than required in 2022\u2014\nlikely in anticipation of the increasingly stringent \nstandards for the ensuing years.  Pet. App. 28a (citing \nJ.A. 202).  That says nothing about how automakers \nwould respond if they did not need to meet California\u2019s \nstandards ever again.  The court also highlighted that \nthe intervening automakers had suggested that \u201cinter-\nnal sustainability forces and external market forces\u201d \nwere resulting in the production of more electric vehi-\ncles.  Id. at 24a n.8 (quoting C.A. Industry Resp.-Int. \nBr. 6-7).  But those automakers never said that every \nautomaker would exceed California\u2019s standards if the \nstandards were vacated.  To the contrary, as petition-\ners explained in reply, five individual automakers in-\ntervened precisely because a decision vacating the \nwaiver would put them at a \u201ccompetitive disad-\nvantage.\u201d  J.A. 211 (quoting C.A. Industry Resp.-Int. \nBr. 17).  That is, those five individual automakers were \nconcerned that other automakers\u2014many of whom have \nremained silent throughout this litigation\u2014would pull \nback their electric-vehicle numbers and instead sell \nmore liquid-fuel-powered vehicles.   \nb.  Even if petitioners were legally required to pro-\nduce record evidence to support redressability, plenty \nsuch evidence existed.  The record included 14 declara-\ntions explaining how California\u2019s standards depress de-\nmand for liquid fuel, and how petitioners\u2019 injuries \n\n38 \n \nwould be ameliorated if the waiver were vacated.  \nOther declarants further noted that California itself \nhad recently projected that the waiver would \u201creduce \nemissions through reductions in fuel production.\u201d  J.A. \n148 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see \nJ.A. 180; see also J.A. 174 (similar statements by Min-\nnesota, which has adopted California\u2019s standards).  Ad-\nditional record evidence likewise documented Califor-\nnia\u2019s position that it needs its greenhouse-gas stand-\nards to reduce motor-vehicle emissions and that doing \nso decreases liquid-fuel consumption.  That included \nCalifornia\u2019s 2021 comment representing that its stand-\nards are \u201ccritical not just for immediate emissions re-\nductions but also\u201d for \u201cgreater emission reductions in \nthe future.\u201d  J.A. 66.  And California elsewhere had \npublicly explained that the standards increase the \nnumber of electric vehicles in use, thereby avoiding \n\u201cproduction and delivery of gasoline.\u201d  J.A. 84.   \nNone of this evidence was enough for the court of \nappeals.  In context, the court apparently thought that \npetitioners could meet their burden of showing re-\ndressability only by providing affidavits from automak-\ners promising to change production or pricing if the \nwaiver were vacated.  This Court has never required \nthe endorsement of a directly regulated third party be-\nfore an indirectly regulated party can sue, and it should \nnot create such a rule now.  Doing so would make it \nimpossible for many parties indirectly affected by gov-\nernment action to secure judicial relief and would cre-\nate incentives for government gamesmanship.  See  \npp. 41-45, infra.  \n\n39 \n \n2. The \ndecision \nbelow \nconflates  \nredressability with mootness \nThe decision below creates additional doctrinal con-\nfusion because it conflates mootness and redressabil-\nity.  The court of appeals thought that the redressabil-\nity inquiry here was \u201cfurther complicated by the rela-\ntively short duration of the waiver.\u201d  Pet. App. 22a.  As \nthe court saw it, petitioners needed to demonstrate not \nonly that manufacturers were likely to respond to a ju-\ndicial decision vacating the waiver by \u201cchanging their \nfleets,\u201d but also that they \u201cwould do so relatively \nquickly\u2014by Model Year 2025\u201d\u2014the year in which the \ncourt believed EPA\u2019s waiver terminated.  Id. at 23a.  In \nthe court\u2019s view, because vehicle product cycles \u201ccan \nalso begin years before a vehicle is launched,\u201d it was \n\u201cfar from clear\u201d that automakers could \u201cchange \ncourse . . . within the model years covered by the \nwaiver.\u201d  Id. at 24a. \nThose (misplaced) timing concerns sound in moot-\nness, not redressability.  Redressability, like the other \nelements of standing, is assessed at the time the suit is \nfiled.  See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 569 n.4.  Here, petitioners \nbrought suit immediately after EPA\u2019s waiver rein-\nstatement in 2022.  At that point, the waiver was sched-\nuled to be in effect for nearly four years.  There was \nample evidence in the record that automakers are at \nleast nimble enough to change a production choice or a \nvehicle price four years in advance\u2014surely enough to \naffect a single dollar of petitioners\u2019 sales.  See pp. 37-\n38, supra; J.A. 209-211.  Indeed, the court of appeals \nrelied on a comment from Toyota explaining that some \nmanufacturers were producing their vehicle fleets one \nyear in advance\u2014which affirmatively undermines the \nnotion that no manufacturer could change plans four \nyears in advance.  Pet. App. 24a; see J.A. 98-100. \n\n40 \n \nGiven that context, the court\u2019s emphasis on the \u201crel-\natively short nature of the waiver\u201d makes sense only as \na concern that the case was approaching model year \n2025 still unresolved.  Pet. App. 25a; see C.A. Oral Arg. \n34:46-34:49 (Garcia, J.) (\u201c[Y]ou need about two more \nyears to plan and adjust how you\u2019re producing vehicles, \nand I don\u2019t see how we can assume that\u2019s going to hap-\npen by model year [20]25.\u201d).  But it \u201cis the doctrine of \nmootness, not standing, that addresses whether \u2018an in-\ntervening circumstance has deprived the plaintiff of a \npersonal stake in the outcome of the lawsuit.\u2019  \u201d  West \nVirginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, 719 (2022) (quoting \nGenesis HealthCare Corp. v. Symczyk, 569 U.S. 66, 72 \n(2013)).  Indeed, the federal government recently ex-\nplained to this Court that when its regulations operate \non a short time horizon, Article III concerns should be \nevaluated under the rubric of mootness, not redressa-\nbility.  See FCC Br. 14, FCC v. Consumers\u2019 Research, \nNo. 24-354 (explaining that the mootness doctrine ap-\nplies when \u201cthe challenged action is in its duration too \nshort to be fully litigated\u201d) (citation omitted). \nThat \u201cdistinction matters\u201d for several reasons.  \nWest Virginia, 597 U.S. at 719.  First, although plain-\ntiffs have the burden to establish Article III standing, \nthe burden flips for mootness.  EPA thus would \u201cbear[] \nthe burden to establish that a once-live case has be-\ncome moot.\u201d  Ibid.  And neither intervenors nor EPA \npointed the court of appeals to evidence sufficient to \nshow that automakers\u2019 decisions have become irrevo-\ncable.  Because the court misconstrued its mootness \nconcern as a redressability obstacle, they had no need \nto.   \nSecond, because mootness would have been a new \ndevelopment, the court below would have had to con-\n\n41 \n \nsider the supplemental record evidence that petition-\ners offered.  Counsel for the state and local government \nintervenors made arguments sounding in mootness for \nthe first time at oral argument.  In response, petition-\ners submitted supplemental declarations from individ-\nuals experienced in vehicle-emission compliance.  \nThose declarations explained that \u201cautomobile manu-\nfacturers could and likely would change their produc-\ntion, pricing, and/or distribution plans for Model Year \n2025 as late as December 2025, but at a minimum well \ninto 2025.\u201d  J.A. 215, 220.  But the court rejected peti-\ntioners\u2019 supplemental brief and accompanying declara-\ntions as too late to show redressability.  Pet. App. 31a.  \nHad the court properly characterized California\u2019s ar-\nguments as newly raised concerns about mootness, \nthere would have been no doubt about the propriety of \npetitioners\u2019 supplemental responses.   \nThird, and critically, mootness doctrine contains ex-\nceptions that redressability does not.  In particular, if \nthere is a concern about the \u201crelatively short nature of \nthe waiver,\u201d Pet. App. 25a, then the case would be an \nexcellent candidate for applying \u201cthe established ex-\nception to mootness for disputes capable of repetition, \nyet evading review.\u201d  Federal Election Comm\u2019n v. Wis-\nconsin Right To Life, Inc., 551 U.S. 449, 462 (2007).  \nBut if that concern is improperly characterized as go-\ning to redressability, the challengers are out of luck.   \n3. The decision below creates bad policy \nThe decision below stacks bad policy on top of bad \nlaw.  It would put injured businesses at the mercy of \nregulated third parties whose interests may not align, \nincentivize agency mischief, and create a one-way \nratchet in favor of regulators over the regulated. \n\n42 \n \na. To start, the court of appeals\u2019 rule means that in-\ndirectly regulated entities will often be unable to chal-\nlenge government action that undeniably injures them.  \nThat is because an indirectly regulated entity\u2019s stand-\ning will often depend on the actions of directly regu-\nlated parties.  And the interests of directly regulated \nparties and downstream or upstream entities often di-\nverge.  That was the case where \u201cworkers challenged a \nDepartment of Labor rule that unlawfully allowed em-\nployers to access inexpensive foreign labor, with the ef-\nfect of lowering American workers\u2019 wages.\u201d  Corner \nPost, 603 U.S. at 836 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring) (cit-\ning Mendoza v. Perez, 754 F.3d 1002 (D.C. Cir. 2014)).  \nIt is also the case where a business challenges under-\nregulation of a competitor.  See, e.g., Monsanto Co.  \nv. Geertson Seed Farms, 561 U.S. 139, 153-156 (2010) \n(conventional alfalfa farmers had standing to challenge \nderegulation of genetically modified alfalfa); General \nMotors Corp., 519 U.S. at 282, 286-287 (purchaser of \nnatural gas had standing to challenge Ohio\u2019s differen-\ntial tax treatment of gas sales by certain Ohio utilities \nand gas sales by out-of-state sellers).  Justiciable \nclaims of under-regulation may also come from outside \nthe industry, as when insurance companies challenged \nthe recission of vehicle safety standards.  See Motor \nVehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of U.S. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. \nIns. Co., 463 U.S. 29 (1983). \nEven when directly regulated entities and upstream \nor downstream entities are not squarely at odds, other \nconsiderations might prevent a regulated party from \njoining the effort to challenge government action.  \nMembers of the directly regulated industry may be \nmore minimally burdened by an action than down-\nstream actors.  The regulated entity may be unwilling \n\n43 \n \nto risk negative publicity by challenging a popular gov-\nernment action, especially if it has less at stake.  The \ngovernment may have effectively purchased the regu-\nlated entity\u2019s cooperation by doling out countervailing \nregulatory benefits.  Or businesses might simply lack \nthe appetite to confront their regulator in court.   \nThose risks are particularly acute in industries that \nrequire lead time to comply with standards.  In such \nindustries, regulated entities may prefer to cooperate \nwith the agency in exchange for certainty about the fu-\nture regulatory environment or other benefits. The \nagency action may still have sweeping effect, but the \nonly viable plaintiffs would have no incentive to bring \nsuit.  That was true here, where automakers had incen-\ntives to cooperate with EPA and California to obtain \nregulatory stability and to avoid the perceived negative \npublicity of interfering with California\u2019s environmental \nefforts.  In short, one industry should not be held hos-\ntage to a related industry\u2019s incentives.   \nb. The decision below creates troubling incentives \nfor agencies, too.  It teaches agencies that they can tar-\nget entire industries with crippling burdens so long as \nthey act through a conduit and placate that conduit.  \nHere, EPA, California, and several automakers en-\ntered into \u201cCalifornia Framework Agreements\u201d com-\nmitting the automakers to accede to California\u2019s stand-\nards in exchange for certain benefits like additional \nlead time.  CARB, Framework Agreements on Clean \nCars (Aug. 17, 2020), https://perma.cc/ZM4Z-GDEK.  \nHaving entered into those agreements, the select au-\ntomakers that intervened in this case were forced into \ndefending California\u2019s standards, lest they be left to \ncompete in a market undisturbed by California\u2019s artifi-\ncial distortions.  But appeasing the directly regulated \nindustry should not insulate agency action from review, \n\n44 \n \nparticularly if that action cripples numerous other in-\ndustries.  \nA too-demanding redressability standard may also \nencourage agencies to act over shorter time horizons to \navoid meaningful review.  Under the reasoning of the \ncourt below, EPA\u2019s latest waiver decision was effec-\ntively unchallengeable because it applied \u201conly\u201d over \nfour years.  Pet. App. 22a.  That reasoning would have \nthe perverse effect of shielding from review the most \nimportant and politically sensitive issues on which \npresidential administrations may disagree.  See, e.g., \nWest Virginia, 597 U.S. at 715-718 (describing the his-\ntory of EPA\u2019s Clean Power Plan across presidential ad-\nministrations).  California\u2019s Section 209(b) waivers for \nclimate-change-focused standards are a perfect exam-\nple:  EPA has granted or rescinded a waiver like clock-\nwork with each change in administration.  An inflated \nredressability standard all but guarantees that these \ncourse-changes mean that agency authority is never \nsettled, even in the most consequential cases.   \nc. Finally, the decision below creates a one-way \nratchet in favor of the regulator over the regulated.  A \nState will always have \u201ca legitimate interest in the con-\ntinued enforceability of its own statutes,\u201d regardless of \ntheir effects.  Maine v. Taylor, 477 U.S. 131, 137 (1986).  \nA State\u2019s interest in vindicating its laws would presum-\nably allow California to challenge or intervene to de-\nfend any decision granting or denying a waiver.  See \nC.A. State & Local Gov. Intervention Mot. 10 (citing \nAlaska v. Department of Transp., 868 F.2d 441, 444 \n(D.C. Cir. 1989)).  As California puts it, with EPA\u2019s \n\u201cwaiver, its standards have legal force; without it, they \ndo not,\u201d so it need not show that the waiver influences \nthe \u201cmix of cars.\u201d  Cal. Br. in Opp. 14 n.5 (citing Alli-\nance for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 382).  But under \n\n45 \n \nthe court of appeals\u2019 theory, industries targeted by \nCalifornia\u2019s laws have no such luck.   \nD. At \nThe \nVery \nLeast, \nPetitioners \nHave  \nEstablished \nRedressability \nBecause \nThe \nChallenged Waiver Continues In Perpetuity  \nIf there were any doubt that petitioners\u2019 injuries are \nredressable, EPA\u2019s recent admission that its waiver \nhas no definite end point should remove it.  Even under \nthe court of appeals\u2019 unduly high bar for redressability, \npetitioners have standing to challenge what EPA now \nfreely describes as an open-ended waiver allowing Cal-\nifornia to impose emission standards in perpetuity.  \n1.  The court of appeals\u2019 standing analysis was \npremised on its assumption that the waiver, and thus \nCalifornia\u2019s standards, would sunset after 2025.  Pet. \nApp. 14a, 22a.  As noted, the court viewed the \u201crela-\ntively short duration of the waiver\u201d as \u201ccomplicat[ing]\u201d \nthe redressability analysis.  Id. at 22a.  According to \nthe court, petitioners needed to demonstrate not only \nthat manufacturers were likely to respond to a judicial \ndecision vacating the waiver by \u201cchanging their fleets,\u201d \nbut also that manufacturers would do so \u201crelatively \nquickly\u2014by Model Year 2025.\u201d  Id. at 23a (emphasis \nadded).  And the court found it \u201cfar from clear\u201d that \nmanufacturers would change their prices or production \ncycles by model year 2025.  Id. at 24a.  \nEPA has now admitted that the D.C. Circuit\u2019s cen-\ntral premise was incorrect.  In opposing certiorari, \nEPA candidly explained that its waiver has no end \ndate.  See EPA Br. in Opp. 12-13.  \u201cContrary to the \ncourt of appeals\u2019 suggestion,\u201d EPA told this Court, the \nwaiver \u201cdoes not expire after model-year 2025.\u201d  Id. at \n12.  When this lawsuit was filed, both the zero- \nemission-vehicle mandate and the greenhouse-gas \nemission standards applied to model year 2025 \u201cand \n\n46 \n \nsubsequent.\u201d  J.A 50 (emphasis added).  In 2022, after \npetitioners sued, California amended its zero-emission-\nvehicle mandate to sunset after model year 2025.  See \np. 16, supra.  But California\u2019s greenhouse-gas emission \nstandards continue to \u201cremain in force\u201d after model \nyear 2025.  EPA Br. in Opp. 13.  So in approving the \nwaiver, EPA approved standards that do not expire un-\nless California chooses to replace them, which it has \nnot done for its greenhouse-gas standards. \nAfter this certiorari petition was fully briefed, EPA \nformalized its position that California\u2019s greenhouse-\ngas emission standards do not sunset.  In its December \n17, 2024 decision granting California\u2019s waiver request \nfor its new Advanced Clean Cars II standards, EPA \nexplained that California\u2019s \u201c[greenhouse-gas] emission \nstandards applicable to 2025 and subsequent model \nyears remain[] unchanged.\u201d  ACC II Decision Docu-\nment 40 n.96.  Those emission standards did not need \nany further approval from EPA; they \u201ccontinue to be \ncovered by EPA\u2019s [Advanced Clean Cars] I waiver is-\nsued in 2013 . . . and reinstated in 2022.\u201d  Ibid. \n2. Given EPA\u2019s newly articulated position, it should \nbe beyond question that vacating the challenged waiver \nwould ameliorate petitioners\u2019 injuries at least to some \ndegree.  Even if the court of appeals were right that it \nwould take several years for every automaker to \nchange its production cycle, Pet. App. 23a, some of the \nrelevant standards are set to govern for more than sev-\neral years.  In other words, while the court below wor-\nried that vehicle manufacturers could not change \ncourse \u201cquickly\u201d enough, ibid., speed should not have \nbeen a concern.  Vacating an indefinite waiver permit-\nting California to enforce stringent emission standards \nwould necessarily have some effect on vehicle pricing, \nproduction, or distribution at some future point\u2014\n\n47 \n \nthereby alleviating at least one dollar of the artificially \ndepressed demand for petitioners\u2019 products.   \nCalifornia and EPA have since made factual find-\nings confirming that the perpetual greenhouse-gas \nemission standards will depress demand for liquid fuel \ninto the next decade.  In recently proposing to approve \nCalifornia\u2019s request to revise its state implementation \nplan, EPA accepted California\u2019s prediction that its \ngreenhouse-gas standards would \u201cachieve additional \ncriteria pollutant emission reductions\u201d in the State \nthrough at least 2037.  89 Fed. Reg. at 82,557 & n.19 \n(citing J.A. 93-94).  Citing the same analysis it had sub-\nmitted when urging EPA to reinstate the challenged \nwaiver, California reiterated that its greenhouse-gas \nemission standards target liquid fuel.  Specifically, Cal-\nifornia attributed the criteria-pollutant reductions to \nthe \u201cavoided production and delivery of gasoline\u201d from \nautomakers\u2019 compliance with those ongoing standards.  \nId. at 82,559 & n.37 (citing J.A. 84).  That analysis\u2014\nembraced by EPA as \u201creasonable and adequately  \nsupported\u201d\u2014recognizes that California\u2019s greenhouse-\ngas emission standards will continue to affect liquid-\nfuel consumption for more than a decade.  Id. at 82,558.  \nAt least one automaker is likely to adjust a single pro-\nduction or pricing decision over that period.   \n* * * \nThis case really is this simple:  petitioners make and \nsell liquid fuels.  EPA\u2019s waiver allows California to en-\nforce standards requiring fewer cars that run on liquid \nfuel.  Indeed, California\u2019s goal is to eliminate reliance \non petitioners\u2019 products entirely.  Removing EPA\u2019s \nwaiver would thus likely cause at least a single cus-\ntomer to purchase at least a dollar\u2019s worth more of pe-\ntitioners\u2019 products.  The legality of EPA\u2019s actions may \n\n48 \n \nraise controversial statutory or political questions, but \ntheir justiciability should never have been in doubt.   \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, this Court should  \nreverse the judgment below. \n \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nERIC D.

This targeted approach dramatically increases the likelihood that the subsequent search will yield the precise arguments needed to predict the Court's reasoning, thus providing substantial information gain for solving this specific task.\n\nDesign EIG (0.7): The action demonstrates a highly effective and generalizable legal reasoning strategy: 1) Retrieve a primary source document (petition). 2) Deconstruct the legal question into its core components. 3) Identify the dispositive issue from the lower court's opinion. 4) Formulate a targeted plan to find the petitioners' counter-arguments on that specific issue. This 'focus on the crux' methodology is a cornerstone of efficient legal analysis and is a valuable pattern for the agent to learn and apply in future cases.

The core of the legal question is whether the fuel producers have Article III standing, which hinges on injury-in-fact, causation, and redressability. The D.C. Circuit dismissed the case on redressability, so I need to pay close attention to how the petitioners challenge that specific finding. I will search within the petition document for arguments related to 'standing', 'redressability', 'injury', and 'causation' to extract the key legal reasoning they are presenting to the Supreme Court. This will form the foundation of my analysis."

The query terms ('redressability', 'standing', 'injury', 'automakers', 'market') are perfectly chosen to extract the petitioners' arguments against the D.C. Circuit's holding. Filtering for the 'petition' is a crucial step, as this document will contain the petitioners' most refined arguments for why the Supreme Court should take the case and reverse the lower court's decision on standing.\n\nTask EIG is very high (0.9) because understanding how the fuel producers frame their injury and argue for redressability\u2014despite the automakers' independent market incentives\u2014is the central challenge in predicting the outcome of this standing question. The results will directly inform the analysis of how the current Court, with its specific views on standing and agency power, might react to these arguments.\n\nDesign EIG is also high (0.7) because this action exemplifies a fundamental and effective strategy: when faced with a specific legal question, the first step should be to isolate the primary arguments of the party that lost below. Using a targeted query within the petition for certiorari is a best practice that this action demonstrates. Evaluating the success of this straightforward, foundational approach provides valuable data for refining the overall case analysis methodology.",

U.S. Bank N.A., \n590 U.S. 538, 547 (2020).  Article III standing should \nnot be complicated here.  The question is whether a \nparty has standing to challenge a government action \nthat works by depressing the market for that party\u2019s \nproducts.  To ask the question is to answer it.  Private \nschools have standing to challenge a law prohibiting \nparents from sending their children to private school.  \nPublishers have standing to challenge a law banning \nbookstores from selling their books.  And here, produc-\ners and sellers of liquid fuels have standing to chal-\nlenge a rule requiring automakers to make cars that \nuse less liquid fuel, or none at all. \n\n2 \n \nThis lawsuit arises from the Biden Administration\u2019s \nefforts to force the electrification of the Nation\u2019s vehi-\ncle fleet.  In 2021, President Biden announced his \u201cgoal \nthat 50 percent of all new passenger cars and light \ntrucks sold in 2030 be zero-emission vehicles,\u201d as part \nof his administration\u2019s efforts to \u201caddress the climate \ncrisis.\u201d  86 Fed. Reg. 43,583, 43,583 (Aug. 5, 2021).  At \nthe time, electric vehicles made up around 4% of the \nnew automobile market.  So to fast-forward to the re-\nsult the President wanted\u2014fewer combustion-engine \nvehicles on the road and less liquid fuel consumed\u2014the \nfederal government pursued a multi-pronged strategy \nof federal and state regulation.  \nOn the state front, EPA turned to Section 209 of  \nthe Clean Air Act.  That unique provision broadly \npreempts States from adopting their own motor-vehicle \nemission standards.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(a).  But it per-\nmits California\u2014and California alone\u2014to obtain a nar-\nrow waiver from federal preemption.  Id. \u00a7 7543(b).  To \nreceive a special preemption waiver, California must \ndemonstrate that it \u201cneed[s]\u201d its own emission stand-\nards \u201cto meet compelling and extraordinary condi-\ntions.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7543(b)(1)(B).   \nFor decades, EPA granted Section 209(b) preemp-\ntion waivers to California to address the State\u2019s local \npollution problems, such as smog.  In recent years, \nhowever, different administrations have flip-flopped on \nwhether Section 209(b) permits EPA to grant Califor-\nnia a waiver to tackle global climate change.  Most rel-\nevant here is EPA\u2019s 2022 flip, in which it reinstated a \nonce-granted, once-revoked waiver for California\u2019s \n\u201cAdvanced Clean Cars\u201d program.  That program in-\ncludes a set of stringent greenhouse-gas emission \nstandards, as well as a mandate requiring automakers \nto meet a 22% zero-emission-vehicle target by model \n\n3 \n \nyear 2025.  Pet. App. 55a-57a.  California\u2019s governor \nexplained that the program works \u201cto end our reliance \non fossil fuels.\u201d1  \nPetitioners immediately challenged EPA\u2019s rein-\nstated waiver.  Petitioners are entities (and associa-\ntions of entities) that produce or sell liquid fuels and \nthe raw materials used to make them.  They challenged \nEPA\u2019s approval of California\u2019s standards as incon-\nsistent with the major-questions doctrine and the plain \ntext of Section 209(b), which allows for a special Cali-\nfornia exemption only for problems localized to and \nsolvable in California\u2014not for global issues like cli-\nmate change.  To establish their standing, petitioners \nsubmitted 14 declarations explaining that California\u2019s \nstandards target their products and will result in lower \nsales.  \nThe court of appeals held that petitioners lacked Ar-\nticle III standing.  The court theorized that vacating \nEPA\u2019s waiver, and thus eliminating California\u2019s coer-\ncive regulations, might not have any effect on car man-\nufacturers\u2019 decisions about the composition of their \nfleets, given market demand.  As a result, the court \nconcluded that petitioners had not shown that a favor-\nable decision would redress their economic injuries.  \nPet. App. 29a. \nThat cannot be right.  The entire point of Califor-\nnia\u2019s Advanced Clean Cars program is to reduce de-\nmand for petitioners\u2019 products:  the regulations are de-\nsigned to compel automakers to change the kind of ve-\nhicles they produce so as to decrease the amount of liq-\nuid fuel burned by drivers.  No one disputes that is the \naim of California\u2019s standards.  It is why EPA praised \n \n1 \nGovernor Gavin Newsom, Governor Newsom Statement on \nBiden Administration\u2019s Restoration of California\u2019s Clean Car \nWaiver (Mar. 9, 2022), https://perma.cc/T92E-2XM8. \n\n4 \n \nits waiver as a \u201ccritical step to confront the climate cri-\nsis.\u201d2  Eliminating the waiver and wiping California\u2019s \nAdvanced Clean Cars program off the books would \nthus be likely to remedy at least one dollar of petition-\ners\u2019 economic injuries.  Redressability here should not \nbe more complicated than that. \nThere are three doctrinal paths to that com-\nmonsense conclusion.  First, and most simply, redress-\nability is satisfied because a favorable decision would \n\u201cremove a regulatory hurdle\u201d to the sale of petitioners\u2019 \nproducts.  Energy Future Coal. v. EPA, 793 F.3d 141, \n144 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (Kavanaugh, J.); see Bennett \nv. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 169 (1997).  Second, even absent \nthat categorical rule, challengers to a government ac-\ntion may establish redressability by relying on the ac-\ntion\u2019s \u201cpredictable effect\u201d on third parties.  Depart-\nment of Commerce v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 768 \n(2019).  It is entirely predictable that California\u2019s reg-\nulation of automakers would \u201ccause downstream or up-\nstream economic injuries to others in the chain\u201d\u2014 \nespecially petitioners.  FDA v. Alliance for Hippo-\ncratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 384 (2024).  Third, at a mini-\nmum petitioners\u2019 injuries are redressable because \nEPA has now clarified that its waiver has no expiration \ndate.  Not even the court below doubted that setting \naside a perpetual waiver would likely affect automaker \nbehavior at some point in the future. \nArticle III\u2019s redressability requirement exists to \nalign injuries and remedies, so that litigants do not sue \nthe wrong parties and courts do not issue overly broad \n \n2 \nEPA, News Release:  What They Are Saying:  EPA Restora-\ntion of California Waiver Will Support State Climate Action, Im-\nprove Air Quality, and Advance our Electric Vehicle Future (Mar. \n11, 2022), https://perma.cc/896Q-N2X5 (EPA News Release).  \n\n5 \n \nrelief or advisory opinions.  The redressability require-\nment does not exist to block the intended targets of \ngovernment regulation from challenging the very reg-\nulations that threaten their existence, so that courts \ncan avoid deciding controversial or difficult questions.  \nThis Court should reverse. \nOPINION BELOW \nThe opinion of the court of appeals (Pet. App. \n1a-49a) is reported at 98 F.4th 288.  The EPA order \nunder review (Pet. App. 50a-285a) is available at \n87 Fed. Reg. 14,332. \nJURISDICTION \nThe court of appeals entered judgment on April 9, \n2024.  The petition for a writ of certiorari was filed on \nJuly 2, 2024, and granted on December 13, 2024.  This \nCourt has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nRelevant statutory provisions are reproduced in an \nappendix to this brief. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Statutory Background \n\u201cThe Clean Air Act regulates pollution-generating \nemissions from both stationary sources, such as facto-\nries and powerplants, and moving sources, such as \ncars, trucks, and aircraft.\u201d  Utility Air Regul. Grp.  \nv. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 308 (2014).  This case concerns  \nTitle II of the Act, which authorizes EPA to regulate \nemissions from new motor vehicles.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7521, \n7543.   \nTo effectuate a (mostly) uniform federal emissions \nregime, Section 209(a) of Title II broadly prohibits \nStates from \u201cadopt[ing] or attempt[ing] to enforce any \n\n6 \n \nstandard relating to the control of emissions from new \nmotor vehicles.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(a).  This preemption \nprovision prevents \u201can anarchic patchwork of federal \nand state regulatory programs, a prospect which \nthreatened to create nightmares for the manufactur-\ners.\u201d  Motor Equip. Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 627 F.2d 1095, \n1109 (D.C. Cir. 1979).   \nCongress created one exception to Section 209(a)\u2019s \nbroad preemption of state emission standards:  Section \n209(b), which authorizes EPA to \u201cwaive\u201d preemption \nfor certain standards adopted by California.  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7543(b).3  Congress granted California this special \nstatus because of the State\u2019s \u201cunique problems\u201d with \nsmog and other local issues caused by so-called \u201ccrite-\nria\u201d pollutants like particulate matter.  H.R. Rep. No. \n90-728, at 22 (1967).  In particular, California\u2019s atypical \n\u201cgeography and prevailing wind patterns,\u201d together \nwith its unusually large number of vehicles, made smog \na more persistent problem there than elsewhere.   \n49 Fed. Reg. 18,887, 18,890 (May 3, 1984) (citing  \n113 Cong. Rec. 30,948 (Nov. 2, 1967)). \nCongress limited California\u2019s ability to separately \nregulate emissions in several ways.  The onus is first \non California, which must \u201cdetermine[] that the State \nstandards will be, in the aggregate, at least as protec-\ntive of public health and welfare as applicable Federal \nstandards.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(b)(1).  After the State \nmakes that determination and files an application, \nEPA must deny a waiver if it finds that (1) California\u2019s \n \n3 \nSection 209(b) does not name California.  It instead makes a \npreemption waiver possible for \u201cany State\u201d that had adopted certain \nstandards \u201cprior to March 30, 1966.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(b)(1).  But as \nCongress was aware, California was the only State that met this cri-\nterion and \u201cis thus the only state eligible for a waiver.\u201d  Motor Equip. \nMfrs.

U.S. Bank N.A., \n590 U.S. 538, 547 (2020).  Article III standing should \nnot be complicated here.  The question is whether a \nparty has standing to challenge a government action \nthat works by depressing the market for that party\u2019s \nproducts.  To ask the question is to answer it.  Private \nschools have standing to challenge a law prohibiting \nparents from sending their children to private school.  \nPublishers have standing to challenge a law banning \nbookstores from selling their books.  And here, produc-\ners and sellers of liquid fuels have standing to chal-\nlenge a rule requiring automakers to make cars that \nuse less liquid fuel, or none at all. \n\n2 \n \nThis lawsuit arises from the Biden Administration\u2019s \nefforts to force the electrification of the Nation\u2019s vehi-\ncle fleet.  In 2021, President Biden announced his \u201cgoal \nthat 50 percent of all new passenger cars and light \ntrucks sold in 2030 be zero-emission vehicles,\u201d as part \nof his administration\u2019s efforts to \u201caddress the climate \ncrisis.\u201d  86 Fed. Reg. 43,583, 43,583 (Aug. 5, 2021).  At \nthe time, electric vehicles made up around 4% of the \nnew automobile market.  So to fast-forward to the re-\nsult the President wanted\u2014fewer combustion-engine \nvehicles on the road and less liquid fuel consumed\u2014the \nfederal government pursued a multi-pronged strategy \nof federal and state regulation.  \nOn the state front, EPA turned to Section 209 of  \nthe Clean Air Act.  That unique provision broadly \npreempts States from adopting their own motor-vehicle \nemission standards.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(a).  But it per-\nmits California\u2014and California alone\u2014to obtain a nar-\nrow waiver from federal preemption.  Id. \u00a7 7543(b).  To \nreceive a special preemption waiver, California must \ndemonstrate that it \u201cneed[s]\u201d its own emission stand-\nards \u201cto meet compelling and extraordinary condi-\ntions.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7543(b)(1)(B).   \nFor decades, EPA granted Section 209(b) preemp-\ntion waivers to California to address the State\u2019s local \npollution problems, such as smog.  In recent years, \nhowever, different administrations have flip-flopped on \nwhether Section 209(b) permits EPA to grant Califor-\nnia a waiver to tackle global climate change.  Most rel-\nevant here is EPA\u2019s 2022 flip, in which it reinstated a \nonce-granted, once-revoked waiver for California\u2019s \n\u201cAdvanced Clean Cars\u201d program.  That program in-\ncludes a set of stringent greenhouse-gas emission \nstandards, as well as a mandate requiring automakers \nto meet a 22% zero-emission-vehicle target by model \n\n3 \n \nyear 2025.  Pet. App. 55a-57a.  California\u2019s governor \nexplained that the program works \u201cto end our reliance \non fossil fuels.\u201d1  \nPetitioners immediately challenged EPA\u2019s rein-\nstated waiver.  Petitioners are entities (and associa-\ntions of entities) that produce or sell liquid fuels and \nthe raw materials used to make them.  They challenged \nEPA\u2019s approval of California\u2019s standards as incon-\nsistent with the major-questions doctrine and the plain \ntext of Section 209(b), which allows for a special Cali-\nfornia exemption only for problems localized to and \nsolvable in California\u2014not for global issues like cli-\nmate change.  To establish their standing, petitioners \nsubmitted 14 declarations explaining that California\u2019s \nstandards target their products and will result in lower \nsales.  \nThe court of appeals held that petitioners lacked Ar-\nticle III standing.  The court theorized that vacating \nEPA\u2019s waiver, and thus eliminating California\u2019s coer-\ncive regulations, might not have any effect on car man-\nufacturers\u2019 decisions about the composition of their \nfleets, given market demand.  As a result, the court \nconcluded that petitioners had not shown that a favor-\nable decision would redress their economic injuries.  \nPet. App. 29a. \nThat cannot be right.  The entire point of Califor-\nnia\u2019s Advanced Clean Cars program is to reduce de-\nmand for petitioners\u2019 products:  the regulations are de-\nsigned to compel automakers to change the kind of ve-\nhicles they produce so as to decrease the amount of liq-\nuid fuel burned by drivers.  No one disputes that is the \naim of California\u2019s standards.  It is why EPA praised \n \n1 \nGovernor Gavin Newsom, Governor Newsom Statement on \nBiden Administration\u2019s Restoration of California\u2019s Clean Car \nWaiver (Mar. 9, 2022), https://perma.cc/T92E-2XM8. \n\n4 \n \nits waiver as a \u201ccritical step to confront the climate cri-\nsis.\u201d2  Eliminating the waiver and wiping California\u2019s \nAdvanced Clean Cars program off the books would \nthus be likely to remedy at least one dollar of petition-\ners\u2019 economic injuries.  Redressability here should not \nbe more complicated than that. \nThere are three doctrinal paths to that com-\nmonsense conclusion.  First, and most simply, redress-\nability is satisfied because a favorable decision would \n\u201cremove a regulatory hurdle\u201d to the sale of petitioners\u2019 \nproducts.  Energy Future Coal. v. EPA, 793 F.3d 141, \n144 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (Kavanaugh, J.); see Bennett \nv. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 169 (1997).  Second, even absent \nthat categorical rule, challengers to a government ac-\ntion may establish redressability by relying on the ac-\ntion\u2019s \u201cpredictable effect\u201d on third parties.  Depart-\nment of Commerce v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 768 \n(2019).  It is entirely predictable that California\u2019s reg-\nulation of automakers would \u201ccause downstream or up-\nstream economic injuries to others in the chain\u201d\u2014 \nespecially petitioners.  FDA v. Alliance for Hippo-\ncratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 384 (2024).  Third, at a mini-\nmum petitioners\u2019 injuries are redressable because \nEPA has now clarified that its waiver has no expiration \ndate.  Not even the court below doubted that setting \naside a perpetual waiver would likely affect automaker \nbehavior at some point in the future. \nArticle III\u2019s redressability requirement exists to \nalign injuries and remedies, so that litigants do not sue \nthe wrong parties and courts do not issue overly broad \n \n2 \nEPA, News Release:  What They Are Saying:  EPA Restora-\ntion of California Waiver Will Support State Climate Action, Im-\nprove Air Quality, and Advance our Electric Vehicle Future (Mar. \n11, 2022), https://perma.cc/896Q-N2X5 (EPA News Release).  \n\n5 \n \nrelief or advisory opinions.  The redressability require-\nment does not exist to block the intended targets of \ngovernment regulation from challenging the very reg-\nulations that threaten their existence, so that courts \ncan avoid deciding controversial or difficult questions.  \nThis Court should reverse. \nOPINION BELOW \nThe opinion of the court of appeals (Pet. App. \n1a-49a) is reported at 98 F.4th 288.  The EPA order \nunder review (Pet. App. 50a-285a) is available at \n87 Fed. Reg. 14,332. \nJURISDICTION \nThe court of appeals entered judgment on April 9, \n2024.  The petition for a writ of certiorari was filed on \nJuly 2, 2024, and granted on December 13, 2024.  This \nCourt has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nRelevant statutory provisions are reproduced in an \nappendix to this brief. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Statutory Background \n\u201cThe Clean Air Act regulates pollution-generating \nemissions from both stationary sources, such as facto-\nries and powerplants, and moving sources, such as \ncars, trucks, and aircraft.\u201d  Utility Air Regul. Grp.  \nv. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 308 (2014).  This case concerns  \nTitle II of the Act, which authorizes EPA to regulate \nemissions from new motor vehicles.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7521, \n7543.   \nTo effectuate a (mostly) uniform federal emissions \nregime, Section 209(a) of Title II broadly prohibits \nStates from \u201cadopt[ing] or attempt[ing] to enforce any \n\n6 \n \nstandard relating to the control of emissions from new \nmotor vehicles.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(a).  This preemption \nprovision prevents \u201can anarchic patchwork of federal \nand state regulatory programs, a prospect which \nthreatened to create nightmares for the manufactur-\ners.\u201d  Motor Equip. Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 627 F.2d 1095, \n1109 (D.C. Cir. 1979).   \nCongress created one exception to Section 209(a)\u2019s \nbroad preemption of state emission standards:  Section \n209(b), which authorizes EPA to \u201cwaive\u201d preemption \nfor certain standards adopted by California.  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7543(b).3  Congress granted California this special \nstatus because of the State\u2019s \u201cunique problems\u201d with \nsmog and other local issues caused by so-called \u201ccrite-\nria\u201d pollutants like particulate matter.  H.R. Rep. No. \n90-728, at 22 (1967).  In particular, California\u2019s atypical \n\u201cgeography and prevailing wind patterns,\u201d together \nwith its unusually large number of vehicles, made smog \na more persistent problem there than elsewhere.   \n49 Fed. Reg. 18,887, 18,890 (May 3, 1984) (citing  \n113 Cong. Rec. 30,948 (Nov. 2, 1967)). \nCongress limited California\u2019s ability to separately \nregulate emissions in several ways.  The onus is first \non California, which must \u201cdetermine[] that the State \nstandards will be, in the aggregate, at least as protec-\ntive of public health and welfare as applicable Federal \nstandards.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(b)(1).  After the State \nmakes that determination and files an application, \nEPA must deny a waiver if it finds that (1) California\u2019s \n \n3 \nSection 209(b) does not name California.  It instead makes a \npreemption waiver possible for \u201cany State\u201d that had adopted certain \nstandards \u201cprior to March 30, 1966.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(b)(1).  But as \nCongress was aware, California was the only State that met this cri-\nterion and \u201cis thus the only state eligible for a waiver.\u201d  Motor Equip. \nMfrs. Ass\u2019n, 627 F.2d at 1100 n.1. \n\n7 \n \nprotectiveness determination is \u201carbitrary and capri-\ncious,\u201d id. \u00a7 7543(b)(1)(A); (2) California \u201cdoes not need \nsuch State standards to meet compelling and extraor-\ndinary conditions,\u201d id. \u00a7 7543(b)(1)(B); or (3) the pro-\nposed state standards are inconsistent with federal \nemission standards, id. \u00a7 7543(b)(1)(C). \nIn 1977, ten years after setting up this preemption \nframework, Congress amended the Clean Air Act to al-\nlow other States to follow California.  Any State may \nnow \u201cadopt and enforce\u201d California standards \u201cfor \nwhich a waiver has been granted,\u201d so long as the adopt-\ning State has an approved plan to attain the federal air-\nquality standards for criteria pollutants.  42 U.S.C.  \n\u00a7\u00a7 7507, 7408(a), 7409.  The upshot of this unusual \npreemption system is that EPA sets nationwide emis-\nsion standards; California may in limited circum-\nstances set more stringent ones for itself; and other \nStates may either apply EPA\u2019s standards or adopt Cal-\nifornia\u2019s, but may not set their own. \nB. Regulatory Background \n1. For decades, Section 209(b) worked as Congress \nhad envisioned.  EPA granted California waivers for \nthe State to set emission standards designed to combat \nlocal air-quality problems like smog.  See, e.g., 38 Fed. \nReg. 10,317, 10,318 (Apr. 26, 1973); 59 Fed. Reg. 48,625, \n48,626 (Sept. 22, 1994).  In recent years, however, Cal-\nifornia has sought to transform its unique preemption \nexception into a tool for targeting global climate \nchange.  It has done so through aggressive regulations \nthat limit vehicle greenhouse-gas emissions and force \nelectrification of the State\u2019s (and consequently the Na-\ntion\u2019s) vehicle fleet. \nCalifornia\u2019s efforts initially stalled.  In 2008, under \nPresident George W. Bush, EPA denied California\u2019s \nfirst application for a waiver for climate-change- \n\n8 \n \nfocused regulations.  California sought to impose \nstandards limiting greenhouse-gas emissions from new \nmotor vehicles in the State.  73 Fed. Reg. 12,156, \n12,156-12,157 (Mar. 6, 2008).  EPA rejected California\u2019s \napplication, explaining that Section 209(b)\u2019s preemp-\ntion waiver permitted California to enact standards to \naddress only \u201clocal and regional\u201d pollution where the \n\u201ccausal factors are local to California\u201d\u2014which obvi-\nously did not include global climate change.  Id. at \n12,163. \nThe day after President Obama took office, Califor-\nnia sought reconsideration of EPA\u2019s denial of its waiver \napplication.  EPA granted reconsideration, reversed it-\nself, and issued the waiver.  74 Fed. Reg. 32,744, 32,783 \n(July 8, 2009).  EPA \u201creject[ed]\u201d its prior conclusion \nthat Section 209(b) did not authorize California to \n\u201cpromulgate state standards designed to address \nglobal climate change problems\u201d and approved Califor-\nnia\u2019s first set of greenhouse-gas emission standards.  \nId. at 32,746.  In assessing the \u201cprotectiveness\u201d of Cal-\nifornia\u2019s standards, EPA relied on California\u2019s finding \nthat the standards \u201cwill result in a reduction in up-\nstream emissions (emission due to the production and \ntransportation of the fuel used by the vehicle) of green-\nhouse gas, criteria and toxic pollutants due to reduced \nfuel usage.\u201d  Id. at 32,750 n.36 (emphasis added) (cita-\ntion omitted).   \nA number of affected car dealers challenged EPA\u2019s \nwaiver decision.  Before the D.C. Circuit could rule, \nEPA \u201cpromulgated national greenhouse gas stand-\nards\u201d for model years 2012 through 2016, \u201cand Califor-\nnia amended its regulations to deem compliance with \nthose national standards as compliance with its own.\u201d  \nChamber of Commerce v. EPA, 642 F.3d 192, 206 (D.C. \nCir. 2011).  Pointing to those two developments, the \n\n9 \n \nD.C. Circuit held that the challenge to EPA\u2019s Section \n209(b) waiver was moot.  Ibid.   \n2. This case concerns California\u2019s next greenhouse-\ngas waiver request.  In 2012, California applied for a \nnew waiver to allow it to impose its \u201cAdvanced Clean \nCars\u201d program, which includes stricter standards \naimed at further curbing greenhouse-gas emissions \nfrom vehicles.  The proposed standards govern all new \npassenger cars, light-duty trucks, and medium-duty \npassenger vehicles sold in California for model year \n2015 through at least model year 2025.  California \npraised its Advanced Clean Cars standards as \u201csome of \nthe best tools we have\u201d \u201cto tackle the climate crisis\u201d by \n\u201creduc[ing] emissions\u201d and \u201cdriv[ing] technological in-\nnovation.\u201d  EPA News Release.   \nTwo components of the Advanced Clean Cars pro-\ngram are especially relevant here.  First, the program \nincludes greenhouse-gas emission standards that limit \ncarbon-dioxide emissions across fleets of vehicles.  \nManufacturers meet those limits by producing more \nelectric vehicles or by implementing technologies that \nreduce fuel consumption in combustion-engine vehi-\ncles, such as \u201celectric drive technologies\u201d and \u201cengine \nefficiency improvements.\u201d  78 Fed. Reg. 2,112, 2,136-\n2,137 (Jan. 9, 2013); see Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1961.3.  \nSecond, the program includes a \u201czero-emission vehicle\u201d \nmandate, which requires each car manufacturer to pro-\nduce and deliver for sale in California an increasing \npercentage of battery-electric or fuel-cell vehicles out \nof its overall fleet (or purchase regulatory \u201ccredits\u201d in-\nstead).  Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(b).  This man-\ndate culminates in a requirement that 22% of a manu-\nfacturer\u2019s passenger vehicles produced for model year \n2025, accounting for credits, must be zero-emission  \n\n10 \n \nvehicles\u2014up from 4.5% in model year 2018.4  Id.  \n\u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A).  California explained in its waiver ap-\nplication that the zero-emission-vehicle mandate \u201ccan \ndramatically reduce petroleum consumption . . . com-\npared to conventional technologies.\u201d  J.A. 28 (citation \nomitted). \nIn 2013, EPA granted the waiver, allowing Califor-\nnia \u201cto enforce its [Advanced Clean Cars] emission  \nregulations.\u201d  78 Fed. Reg. at 2,145.  EPA concluded \nthat California\u2019s standards met Section 209(b)\u2019s  \nrequirements\u2014including that they were \u201cneeded to meet \ncompelling and extraordinary conditions\u201d\u2014because \nthe threat of global climate change was itself \u201cextraor-\ndinary.\u201d  Id. at 2,129.  Notably, EPA credited Califor-\nnia\u2019s finding that the cost of its regulations would be \n\u201cmore than offset by consumer fuel savings over the \nlife of the vehicles.\u201d  Id. at 2,138.   \n3. Under the first Trump Administration, EPA re-\nverted to its original approach to Section 209(b).  In a \n2019 joint rulemaking with NHTSA, EPA rescinded the \n2013 preemption waiver for California\u2019s greenhouse-gas \nstandards and zero-emission-vehicle mandate, again \nreasoning that global climate change is not the kind of \n\u201cpeculiar,\u201d California-specific condition covered by \nSection 209(b).  84 Fed. Reg. 51,310, 51,328, 51,342 \n(Sept. 27, 2019).  EPA also found that California did not \n\u201cneed\u201d its standards to \u201cmeet\u201d climate-change condi-\ntions because California\u2019s standards would likely result \n \n4 \nCalifornia\u2019s regulations express this mandate as a \u201ccredit per-\ncentage requirement.\u201d  Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(b)(1).  Be-\ncause electric vehicles with longer ranges can generate more than \none credit, the exact percentage of electric vehicles can vary from \nmanufacturer to manufacturer.  See id. \u00a7 1962.2(d)(5); 78 Fed. Reg. \nat 2,119.  \n\n11 \n \nin \u201cno change in temperatures or physical impacts re-\nsulting from anthropogenic climate change in Califor-\nnia.\u201d  Id. at 51,341. \n4. On his first day in office, President Biden signed \nExecutive Order 13,990, directing EPA to \u201cconsider \nsuspending, revising, or rescinding\u201d the 2019 with-\ndrawal of California\u2019s 2013 waiver.  86 Fed. Reg. 7,037, \n7,037 (Jan. 20, 2021).  EPA dutifully reinstated Califor-\nnia\u2019s waiver, allowing the Advanced Clean Cars pro-\ngram to come back into effect.  Pet. App. 57a. \nIn reinstating the waiver, EPA flipped back to its \n2013 interpretation of Section 209(b).  Pet. App. 155a.  \nUnder that interpretation, California can obtain a \nwaiver so long as it \u201cneeds its program as a whole to \nmeet compelling and extraordinary conditions\u201d\u2014even \nif it does not actually need the specific standards at is-\nsue.  C.A. EPA Br. 84 (emphasis added); see Pet. App. \n158a.  In other words, California can tack on any emis-\nsion standards it likes to its exempt emissions \u201cpro-\ngram,\u201d so long as the State\u2019s local criteria-pollutant \nproblems \u201cpersist.\u201d  C.A. EPA Br. 66.  Applying that \npermissive reading of the statute, EPA concluded that \nthe waiver was justified primarily because California \nneeds its separate vehicle-emission program, as a \nwhole, to address its ongoing problems with criteria \npollutants.  Pet. App. 155a-162a, 186a-188a. \nEPA embraced the significance of its action, herald-\ning the waiver as a \u201ccritical step to confront the climate \ncrisis.\u201d  EPA News Release.  To date, 17 States and the \nDistrict of Columbia have adopted California\u2019s  \ngreenhouse-gas emission standards, its zero-emission-\nvehicle mandate, or both.  California Air Resources \nBoard (CARB), States that Have Adopted California\u2019s \nVehicle Regulations (June 2024), https://perma.cc/ \n\n12 \n \nM6LC-SVR8.  Together with California, those jurisdic-\ntions account for more than 40% of the Nation\u2019s new \nvehicle market.  Pet. App. 179a. \nC. Proceedings Below \n1.  Petitioners are entities (and trade associations \nwhose members include entities) that produce or sell \nliquid fuels\u2014gasoline, diesel, biodiesel, renewable die-\nsel, and ethanol\u2014and the raw materials used to make \nthem.  They promptly challenged EPA\u2019s waiver rein-\nstatement in the D.C. Circuit in May 2022, within 60 \ndays of the agency action.  Pet. App. 15a.   \nAlong with their opening brief in the court of ap-\npeals, petitioners filed 14 standing declarations that \nexplained how reinstating California\u2019s standards would \ndepress demand for liquid fuel, injuring them finan-\ncially in a variety of ways.  J.A. 120-184.  Fuel produc-\ners explained how reducing the demand for their prod-\nucts in California would lead to an unavoidable loss in \nbusiness.  J.A. 133-136.  For example, petitioner Dia-\nmond Alternative Energy explained that it sells renew-\nable diesel, a liquid fuel that can be used interchange-\nably with petroleum-derived diesel; that California \u201cac-\ncounts for almost all of the renewable diesel consumed \nin the United States\u201d; and that the standards would di-\nminish that demand.  J.A. 135. \nOther petitioners similarly established the negative \nimpact of California\u2019s standards on their bottom lines.  \nAn association of convenience stores explained that \nCalifornia\u2019s standards would mean its members\u2019 \u201cfuel-\ning stations sell less fuel\u201d and their convenience stores \nlose revenue because fewer customers \u201ccome through \n[their] stores.\u201d  J.A. 140.  And associations of corn \ngrowers noted that California\u2019s standards would drive \ndown demand for ethanol (which is blended into gaso-\nline), in turn \u201cdecreasing demand for the corn\u201d grown \n\n13 \n \nby their members to produce ethanol.  J.A. 130, 154, \n158, 167.   \nEPA did not contest petitioners\u2019 Article III stand-\ning below.  But California and other state and local gov-\nernment intervenors did.  J.A. 185-187.  They argued \nthat petitioners had not \u201cestablished any probability \nthat manufacturers would change course if EPA\u2019s \n[waiver] decision were vacated\u201d because automakers \nwere planning to increase electric-vehicle production \nfor independent reasons.  J.A. 187.  Their own inter-\nvention motion, however, attached declarations assert-\ning that \u201cadditional gasoline-fueled vehicles would be \nsold during these model years\u201d if EPA\u2019s waiver were \noverturned.  J.A. 115.   \nIn reply, petitioners explained that they had stand-\ning because vacating the waiver would remove a \u201cdirect \nregulatory impediment\u201d to their products\u2019 use.   \nJ.A. 210 (quoting Energy Future Coal., 793 F.3d at \n144).  Petitioners also pointed out that they were enti-\ntled to rely on the \u201creasonably predictable\u201d conduct of \ncar manufacturers.  Ibid.  Petitioners noted that Cali-\nfornia itself had predicted automakers would produce \nmore \u201czero-emission vehicles\u201d in response to its stand-\nards.  Ibid. (quoting C.A. J.A. 237).  And there was am-\nple record evidence that not all manufacturers had \u201cir-\nrevocably committed\u201d to electrification.  Ibid. (citing \nC.A. J.A. 477).  \nAt oral argument in September 2023, counsel for the \nstate and local government intervenors made argu-\nments sounding in mootness, not standing.  In response \nto questioning from the panel, California contended \nthat automakers could no longer change their produc-\ntion and sales plans for vehicles through model year \n2025\u2014the year in which the court apparently assumed \nthe waiver would end.  See C.A. Oral Arg. 1:10:27-\n\n14 \n \n1:10:31 (asserting that petitioners \u201cneed evidence that \nmanufacturers are going to change their product lines \nand sell different vehicles in model year 2025\u201d) (em-\nphasis added).  In reaction to that shifting theory of \njusticiability, petitioners moved to file a supplemental \nbrief and declarations explaining why their petitions \nwere not moot.  Petitioners also explained that the Cal-\nifornia standards covered by EPA\u2019s waiver purported \nto extend beyond model year 2025.  C.A. Pet. Supp. Br. \n5-6; see J.A. 50.  EPA remained conspicuously silent \nabout petitioners\u2019 standing and the temporal scope of \nthe waiver.   \n2. The court of appeals held that petitioners lack \nArticle III standing to challenge EPA\u2019s waiver.  Pet. \nApp. 19a.  Although the court declined to \u201cdefinitively \ndecide\u201d whether petitioners had established injury and \ncausation, it did not question either showing.  Id. at \n21a.   \nInstead, the court of appeals concluded that peti-\ntioners had failed to show that their injuries would be \nredressed if EPA\u2019s decision were set aside.  Pet. App. \n19a.  The court faulted petitioners for \u201cfail[ing] to point \nto any evidence affirmatively demonstrating that vaca-\ntur of the waiver would be substantially likely to\u201d \nprompt automakers to produce fewer electric vehicles \nor alter their prices so that more liquid-fuel-powered \nvehicles would be sold.  Id. at 23a.  It reasoned that \n\u201cunsupported assumptions regarding the future ac-\ntions of third-party market participants are insuffi-\ncient to establish Article III standing.\u201d  Id. at 29a.  The \ncourt also thought that the redressability inquiry was \n\u201ccomplicated by the relatively short duration of the \nwaiver,\u201d id. at 22a, though it disclaimed any finding \nthat the case had been \u201cmooted by the passage of \n\n15 \n \ntime,\u201d id. at 25a.  By hinging its decision on redressa-\nbility, the court effectively held that even if the waiver \nhad been vacated at the moment EPA reinstated it in \n2022, automakers might not have changed any produc-\ntion plans or prices before the end of model year 2025.  \nId. at 22a-24a.  The waiver was pointless the instant it \nwas reinstated. \nThe court of appeals declined to consider petition-\ners\u2019 supplemental brief and declarations.  Pet. App. \n30a.  The court reasoned that there was no \u201cgood \ncause\u201d to supplement the record.  Id. at 31a. \nD. Subsequent Developments \n1. Petitioners sought review in this Court.  In re-\nsponse, EPA explained that while the court of appeals \nhad based its redressability holding on the \u201crelatively \nshort duration of the waiver,\u201d Pet. App. 22a, in EPA\u2019s \nview the waiver does not actually sunset.  EPA Br. in \nOpp. 12-13.  According to EPA, California\u2019s greenhouse-\ngas standards continue to \u201cremain in force\u201d after model \nyear 2025, and \u201cthe waiver likewise does not terminate \nwith model-year 2025.\u201d  Id. at 13.   \nShortly thereafter, EPA took the same position in a \ndifferent regulatory action.  In proposing to approve \nCalifornia\u2019s request to include the Advanced Clean \nCars greenhouse-gas emission standards in the State\u2019s \nupdated state implementation plan, EPA credited Cal-\nifornia\u2019s July 2021 projections that those standards will \nreduce fuel consumption, and thus reduce nitrogen- \noxide and particulate-matter emissions, through at \nleast 2037.  89 Fed. Reg. 82,553, 82,557, 82,558 (Oct. 11, \n2024); see C.A. Reply 4 (citing California\u2019s projections); \nJ.A. 93-94. \n2. On December 17, 2024, EPA granted two new \nSection 209(b) preemption waivers for California, in-\ncluding for the \u201cAdvanced Clean Cars II\u201d program.  \n\n16 \n \nSee 90 Fed. Reg. 642, 642 (Jan. 6, 2025).  That program \n\u201cwill require all new passenger cars and light-duty \ntrucks delivered for sale in California to be zero- \nemission\u201d by 2035.

Starting \nwith model year 2026, Advanced Clean Cars II thus re-\nplaces the zero-emission-vehicle standards challenged \nhere, which apply through model year 2025.5 \nAdvanced Clean Cars II does not, however, amend \nthe challenged greenhouse-gas emission standards.  \nSee EPA Br. in Opp. 5; ACC II Decision Document 40 \nn.96.  Those standards will remain at the model-year \n2025 level of stringency for \u201csubsequent\u201d model years \nand will \u201ccontinue to be covered\u201d by the Advanced \nClean Cars I waiver \u201creinstated in 2022.\u201d  Cal.

They have Article III standing to chal-\nlenge an EPA waiver allowing California to enforce  \nvehicle-emission standards designed to reduce the con-\nsumption of liquid fuel.  The court of appeals was wrong \nto conclude otherwise. \nI. Although the court of appeals did not consider \nthe first two prongs of Article III\u2019s standing require-\nments, petitioners easily established that they have \n \n5 \nAt least some of petitioners plan to challenge EPA\u2019s recent \ndecision to grant that waiver, and one challenge has already been \nfiled.  American Free Enter. Chamber of Com. v. EPA, No. 25-106 \n(9th Cir.).  \n\n17 \n \nsuffered a concrete injury-in-fact fairly traceable to \nEPA\u2019s waiver.  \nA. EPA\u2019s preemption waiver for California\u2019s Ad-\nvanced Clean Cars program hits petitioners with a \nclassic pocketbook injury.  Petitioners produce liquid \nfuel and its component parts, so any reduction in de-\nmand for their products brings down their bottom \nlines.  Petitioners attested to their injuries in their \nmany standing declarations submitted to the court of \nappeals, in which they explained the details of their \nbusinesses and how reduced demand for liquid fuels \nlowers their revenues. \nB. EPA\u2019s waiver causes petitioners\u2019 injuries.  The \nwaiver allows California to enforce its zero-emission-\nvehicle mandate and its greenhouse-gas emission \nstandards\u2014both of which mandate the production of \nvehicles that use less or no liquid fuel.  California\u2019s \nstandards push the car market beyond what consumers \nwould ordinarily demand and automakers would ordi-\nnarily produce and sell; that is the point of the stand-\nards.  There is thus a clear causal connection between \nCalifornia\u2019s market intervention and petitioners\u2019  \nmarket-based injuries.  \nII.  Petitioners\u2019 injuries are redressable for three \nreasons.   \nA. Most simply, a decision vacating EPA\u2019s waiver \nwould remove a regulatory impediment to the use of \npetitioners\u2019 products.  As this Court has found in a va-\nriety of circumstances, the removal of the coercive ef-\nfect of government action on third parties alone suf-\nfices to establish redressability.  Challengers do not \nneed to supply additional record evidence of third par-\nties\u2019 likely reactions.  That is because such challengers \n(or their products) are being denied an opportunity to \n\n18 \n \ncompete in the marketplace, which vacating the gov-\nernment action will redress.  Redressability, after all, \nfocuses on the match between the judicial relief re-\nquested and the injury suffered\u2014and when challeng-\ners seek to vacate a rule targeting their products, the \nmatch is perfect.   \nB. Even if this Court declines to adopt that categor-\nical rule, petitioners can at least establish redressabil-\nity by relying on the predictable effects of the chal-\nlenged government action on third parties.  This Court \nhas time and again distinguished between speculative \nand predictable third-party responses to a judicial de-\ncision.  When a third-party response is speculative, rec-\nord evidence may be required to establish redressabil-\nity.  But when a third-party response is predictable, no \nmore is needed than a dose of common sense.   \nIt is not just predictable but obvious that allowing \nCalifornia to limit vehicles\u2019 emissions will result in less \nfuel consumption.  California\u2019s standards require that \nautomakers produce and sell more fuel-efficient cars \nand fewer cars that run on liquid fuel.  If EPA\u2019s waiver \nis set aside and California\u2019s standards are preempted, \nat least one automaker will choose to sell more vehicles \nwith lower fuel efficiency or more combustion-engine \nvehicles.  It is difficult to imagine that the parties and \ntheir many amici would have litigated this case for \nnearly three years and counting if that were not true.   \nC.  The court of appeals rejected these two straight-\nforward theories of redressability.  Instead, it imposed \nextraordinary burdens on entities indirectly affected \nby agency action, effectively requiring evidence from \nthe directly regulated entities themselves.  The court \nalso raised timing concerns that conflated redressabil-\nity and mootness, with significant consequences.  Its \nmisplaced redressability label flipped the burden of \n\n19 \n \nproof from the government to petitioners, while leaving \npetitioners without recourse to established mootness \nexceptions.   \nIf left uncorrected, the decision below would have \npractical repercussions as serious as its doctrinal er-\nrors.  A heightened redressability requirement would \nlock the courthouse doors to numerous traditional chal-\nlengers to agency action, so long as the targets of reg-\nulation have different interests than directly regulated \nparties (as is often the case).  It would also encourage \nagencies to intentionally act on shorter time horizons \nto shield their actions from review, and it would cut off \nreview of the most politically sensitive actions.  \nD.  At a minimum, petitioners\u2019 injuries are redress-\nable even under the court of appeals\u2019 mistaken reason-\ning, because EPA has now conceded that its waiver for \ncertain California standards does not sunset.  The \ncourt of appeals was concerned about what it viewed as \nthe relatively short four-year duration of the waiver.  \nBut as EPA has since explained to this Court, its \nwaiver does not expire unless California changes its \nstandards, and California has never amended its \ngreenhouse-gas standards.  Put differently, the \nwaiver\u2019s effects do not expire after model year 2025.  \nThere thus can be no plausible dispute that vacating \nthe waiver will have some effect on automaker behavior \nat some point in the future.  Standards that regulate \nmarket allocation forever are all but guaranteed to \nhave at least one dollar of economic impact. \nARGUMENT \nTo demonstrate Article III standing, a plaintiff \nmust show that he suffered a concrete injury, that the \ninjury is fairly traceable to the challenged action, and \nthat the \u201cinjury will be redressed by a favorable deci-\nsion.\u201d  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 \n\n20 \n \n(1992) (citation omitted).  Taken collectively, these re-\nquirements ensure that federal courts decide only \u201cthe \nrights of individuals,\u201d and maintain \u201ctheir proper  \nfunction in a limited and separated government.\u201d  \nTransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413, 423 (2021) \n(citations omitted). \nWhen a plaintiff is directly regulated by a chal-\nlenged agency action, \u201cthere is ordinarily little ques-\ntion\u201d that he has standing to challenge the action.  \nLujan, 504 U.S. at 561.  By contrast, when a \u201cplaintiff \nis not himself the object of the government action or \ninaction he challenges, standing is . . . ordinarily \u2018sub-\nstantially more difficult\u2019 to establish.\u201d  Id. at 562 (cita-\ntion omitted).  Nevertheless, \u201centire classes of admin-\nistrative litigation\u201d have \u201ctraditionally been brought \nby unregulated\u201d but \u201cadversely affected parties.\u201d  Cor-\nner Post, Inc. v. Board of Governors of the Fed. Rsrv. \nSys., 603 U.S. 799, 827, 833 (2024) (Kavanaugh, J., con-\ncurring); see id. at 833-837 (collecting cases).  Those \nchallenges make particular sense where government \nregulations target someone \u201cdownstream or upstream\u201d \nfrom the entities that the regulations directly govern.  \nAlliance for Hippocratic Medicine, 602 U.S. at 384. \nPetitioners here are not directly regulated, but they \nare the prime targets of government regulation.  They \neasily satisfy the three components of Article III \nstanding.  Petitioners produce, refine, or sell liquid \nfuels and the raw materials used to produce them.  \nThey promptly challenged EPA\u2019s waiver, which allows \nCalifornia to impose otherwise-preempted standards \nthat are designed to reduce the use of liquid fuel\u2014 \nhitting petitioners with a classic pocketbook injury.  \nSetting aside EPA\u2019s waiver would mean that California \n\n21 \n \ncannot enforce its standards, ending the artificial de-\npression of demand for petitioners\u2019 products.  This case \nshould be no more complicated than that. \nI. PETITIONERS SUFFERED AN INJURY-IN-\nFACT CAUSED BY EPA\u2019S ACTION \n \nThe court of appeals skipped the injury and causa-\ntion prongs of standing, resting its holding entirely on \nredressability grounds.  That may be because petition-\ners easily satisfy the first two prongs of the Article III \nstanding analysis.  Petitioners suffered concrete and \nparticularized injuries, and those injuries are fairly \ntraceable to EPA\u2019s waiver decision. \nA. Petitioners \nSuffered \nClassic \nPocketbook  \nInjuries \n \nPetitioners include businesses at every stage of the \nsupply chain for liquid fuels.  They grow the raw mate-\nrials for liquid fuel, produce and refine liquid fuel, and \nsell liquid fuel at gas stations and convenience stores.  \nSee, e.g., J.A. 127-128 (producers of corn to make etha-\nnol), 131-132 (producers and sellers of renewable liquid \nfuels), 138-139 (owners of gas stations and convenience \nstores).  Petitioners differ in the exact nature of their \nbusinesses, but they all have one thing in common:  they \nprofit from participating in the liquid-fuels market. \nBy design, California\u2019s standards operate to reduce \nthe liquid-fuels market and thus injure those who par-\nticipate in it.  That is because the Advanced Clean Cars \nstandards aim to reduce emissions by reducing liquid \nfuel combustion in vehicles.  To comply, manufacturers \nmust produce more electric vehicles, subsidize the pro-\nduction of electric vehicles, implement technologies \nthat improve the fuel efficiency of vehicles, or some \ncombination thereof.  See J.A. 8-9 (identifying possible \ncompliance technologies); 78 Fed. Reg. at 2,136-2,137 \n\n22 \n \n(same).  The standards thus force automakers to pro-\nduce a fleet of vehicles that use significantly less liquid \nfuel or no liquid fuel at all.  In fact, California repeat-\nedly represented as much when applying for the chal-\nlenged waiver.  J.A. 35, 49.  Fewer cars that run on liq-\nuid fuel, or more cars that run on less liquid fuel, means \nless liquid fuel sold.  And suppressing demand for a \nparty\u2019s product is the prototypical monetary injury-in-\nfact.  See TransUnion, 594 U.S. at 425; United States \nv. Texas, 599 U.S. 670, 676 (2023).   \nPetitioners explained these prototypical pocketbook \ninjuries in the 14 standing declarations they submitted \nwith their opening brief below.  Those declarations de-\ntail how petitioners participate in the liquid-fuel supply \nchain and how the reduction in demand caused by Cal-\nifornia\u2019s standards would financially injure their busi-\nnesses.  See J.A. 120-184.  For example, producers ex-\nplained that a \u201csignificant reduction in California\u2019s gas-\noline demand, as contemplated by the [Advanced Clean \nCars] I program, will detrimentally impact Valero\u2019s \nbusiness.\u201d  J.A. 147.  And they confirmed their inability \nto \u201cavoid financial harm\u201d by shifting production out-\nside of California or by repurposing their products.  \nJ.A. 170; see J.A. 144-145, 147-150.  As these declara-\ntions underscore, petitioners have a concrete stake in \nthe outcome:  their businesses are on the line.  \u201cThis is \na classic pocketbook injury sufficient to give [them] \nstanding.\u201d  Tyler v. Hennepin Cnty., 598 U.S. 631, 636 \n(2023).   \nB. Petitioners\u2019 Injuries Are Fairly Traceable To \nEPA\u2019s Waiver \nPetitioners likewise satisfy Article III\u2019s causation \nrequirement.  To demonstrate causation, a party must \nestablish a \u201ccausal connection between the injury and \nthe conduct complained of.\u201d  Susan B. Anthony List v. \n\n23 \n \nDriehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 158 (2014) (citation omitted).  \nThat \u201crequires only that the plaintiff\u2019s injury be fairly \ntraceable to the defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d  Lexmark Int\u2019l, \nInc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, \n134 n.6 (2014).  The connection between petitioners\u2019 in-\njuries and EPA\u2019s waiver is straightforward here.  The \nwaiver allows California\u2019s greenhouse-gas emission \nstandards and zero-emission-vehicle mandate to take \neffect, when federal law would otherwise preempt \nthem.  Pet. App. 55a-57a.  Those portions of the Ad-\nvanced Clean Cars program operate by requiring in-\ncreased fuel economy or full electrification, thereby de-\npressing demand for petitioners\u2019 products.   \nPetitioners\u2019 injuries are attributable to government \nregulation, not solely to existing consumer demand for \nelectric vehicles.  The entire purpose of California\u2019s \nstandards is to go beyond what market forces would \nnaturally produce.  That is why California described its \nregulations as \u201ccritical\u201d for \u201cemissions reductions\u201d and \n\u201ccritical for incentivizing production and deployment of \nzero-emission vehicles.\u201d  J.A. 66.  Those standards in-\nclude a 22% zero-emission-vehicle mandate, far above \nwhat the market had naturally produced.  Cal. Code \nRegs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(b)(1); see David Gohlke et al., As-\nsessment of Light-Duty Plug-in Electric Vehicles in \nthe United States, 2010\u20132021, at 1 (Nov. 1, 2022), \nhttps://perma.cc/Y6VE-2QB5.  Because California\u2019s \nstandards aim to reduce liquid-fuel use by increasing \nthe number of electric or fuel-efficient vehicles beyond \nmarket demand, petitioners have \u201clink[ed] their as-\nserted injuries to the government\u2019s regulation . . . of \nsomeone else.\u201d  Alliance for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. \nat 382. \n\n24 \n \nII. PETITIONERS\u2019 INJURIES ARE REDRESSABLE \nBecause petitioners suffered classic pocketbook in-\njuries caused by a federal regulatory action, and be-\ncause they challenged that action almost immediately, \nit would be unusual if petitioners\u2019 injuries were not re-\ndressable.  Redressability requires only that a favora-\nble judicial judgment would \u201ctake steps to slow or re-\nduce\u201d the plaintiff\u2019s injury.  Massachusetts v. EPA, \n549 U.S. 497, 525 (2007).  Thus, when a plaintiff asserts \nan economic injury, she establishes redressability if a \nfavorable decision would put even one dollar back in \nher pocket.  Uzuegbunam v. Preczewski, 592 U.S. 279, \n291 (2021).  That is no high bar.   \nThe bar is easily cleared here.  Most simply, the \nchallenged government action creates a legal hurdle to \nthe use of petitioners\u2019 products, so setting aside that \ngovernment action would provide redress.  And were \nthat not enough, petitioners can always rely on the \n\u201cpredictable effect\u201d of regulation on third parties to es-\ntablish redressability.  Department of Commerce,  \n588 U.S. at 768.  It is certainly predictable that an  \nelectric-vehicle mandate will result in fewer liquid-\nfuel-powered vehicles on the roads; that is the man-\ndate\u2019s raison d\u2019\u00eatre.  At a minimum, the decision below \nmust be vacated because it was premised on a factual \nmistake.  EPA has since confirmed that the waiver al-\nlowing California to target petitioners\u2019 products has no \ndefinite end date.  An agency action limiting the use of \npetitioners\u2019 products in perpetuity must have some \nreal-world effect. \n\n25 \n \nA. Petitioners Have Established Redressability \nBecause They Are Challenging A Regulatory \nHurdle To The Use Of Their Products \nCalifornia\u2019s Advanced Clean Cars standards re-\nquire car manufacturers to produce an increasing per-\ncentage of vehicles that consume less liquid fuel or no \nliquid fuel at all.  Because the standards impose a new \nlegal barrier to the use of petitioners\u2019 products\u2014and \nindeed reducing consumption of petitioners\u2019 products \nis how the standards achieve their intended purpose\u2014 \nvacating EPA\u2019s waiver would provide petitioners with \nredress.  Article III requires nothing more. \n1. Removing \nthe \ncoercive \neffect \nof  \ngovernment standards provides redress \na.  This Court has long recognized that removing the \n\u201cdeterminative or coercive effect\u201d of government reg-\nulation \u201cupon the action of someone else\u201d is sufficient \nto establish redressability.  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 169.  \nThus, if a plaintiff can establish the existence of a reg-\nulatory impediment that prevents its product from be-\ning used, that is enough. \nIn Bennett, this Court made clear that the removal \nof an adverse agency action\u2014even one that operates on \na third party\u2014provides redress to individuals injured \nby that action.  There, a group of ranchers challenged \na biological opinion issued by the U.S. Fish and Wild-\nlife Service, which advised the Bureau of Reclamation \nto maintain minimum water levels at several reservoirs \nthat the ranchers used.  520 U.S. at 159-160.  The gov-\nernment argued that Article III\u2019s causation and re-\ndressability requirements were not met because it was \npossible that the Bureau would independently opt to \nreduce the ranchers\u2019 access to water, even without the \nchallenged biological opinion.  Id. at 168.  This Court \nunanimously disagreed, recognizing that the biological \n\n26 \n \nopinion had a \u201cvirtually determinative effect\u201d on the \nBureau\u2019s decisions because disregarding it could ex-\npose the Bureau and its employees to liability under \nthe Endangered Species Act.  Id. at 170.  The removal \nof the \u201ccoercive\u201d force of the biological opinion on the \nBureau alone established redressability.  Id. at 171.  \nThe ranchers did not need to provide additional evi-\ndence to show that their injury was \u201cfairly traceable\u201d \nto the opinion or that it would \u201clikely be redressed\u201d if \nthe opinion were withdrawn.  Id. at 169-171. \nBennett made explicit what had been assumed in a \nlong line of this Court\u2019s cases resolving challenges to \ngovernment action brought by indirectly regulated \nparties.  For example, this Court heard a suit by pri-\nvate schools challenging as unconstitutional an Oregon \nlaw making it a crime for parents to send their children \nto private school.  Pierce v. Society of the Sisters of the \nHoly Names of Jesus and Mary, 268 U.S. 510, 534 \n(1925).  Although the parents were directly regulated, \nthe private schools were the target\u2014and there was no \ndoubt that they could bring the lawsuit.  The Court did \nnot require the schools to provide evidence that par-\nents would send their children to those schools absent \nOregon\u2019s \u201cunwarranted compulsion.\u201d  Id. at 535.  Simi-\nlarly, in CBS v. United States, this Court found that the \ntelevision network CBS could sue to challenge regula-\ntions denying a license to any broadcasting station that \nconducted certain business with CBS.  316 U.S. 407, \n421-423 (1942).  The Court did not call for evidence that \nlicensees would change course and partner with CBS if \nthe regulations were rescinded; it was enough that po-\ntential licensees intended to comply with the regula-\ntions.  Id. at 422.  \nb. The rule that removal of the \u201cunwarranted com-\npulsion\u201d of government action satisfies redressability \n\n27 \n \ncomports with the original purpose of the redressabil-\nity requirement.  As this Court has repeatedly ex-\nplained, redressability ensures that there is a \u201crela-\ntionship between \u2018the judicial relief requested\u2019 and the \n\u2018injury\u2019 suffered.\u201d  California v. Texas, 593 U.S. 659, \n660 (2021) (quoting Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 753 \nn.19 (1984)).  It thus prevents litigants from suing par-\nties or challenging laws that have \u201cnothing to do with\u201d \ntheir injuries, or requesting overly broad relief.  Id. at \n675; see Haaland v. Brackeen, 599 U.S. 255, 293 (2023) \n(redressability not established because \u201cstate officials \nwho implement [the challenged statute] are not parties \nto the suit\u201d).  And it similarly prevents courts from is-\nsuing \u201cadvisory opinion[s]\u201d that amount to nothing \nmore than \u201ca general authority to conduct oversight,\u201d \nparticularly \u201cof decisions of the elected branches of \nGovernment.\u201d  California, 593 U.S. at 673; see Brack-\neen, 599 U.S. at 294.   \nWhen a plaintiff asks a court to remove a coercive \ngovernment regulation, there is no mismatch between \ninjury and remedy.  Indeed, there is a perfect correla-\ntion between the individual\u2019s injury (which flows from \na constraint that may artificially depress market de-\nmand) and the remedy for that injury (removing the \ngovernment constraint).  And to the extent there are \ndistinct concerns about attenuation, those concerns are \nhoused in other doctrines, such as proximate-cause lim-\nitations that exclude plaintiffs whose injuries are \u201ctoo \nremote\u201d from the conduct a statute prohibits.  See, e.g., \nLexmark, 572 U.S. at 133.  As far as redressability is \nconcerned, however, Article III\u2019s demands are the \nsame whether the plaintiff is directly or indirectly reg-\nulated.   \nc. This Court should confirm the simple, clear rule \nthat the removal of a regulatory hurdle to the use of a \n\n28 \n \nchallenger\u2019s product satisfies Article III\u2019s redressabil-\nity requirement\u2014no matter whether the regulation is \nformally applied to a third party.  That rule has the \nbenefit of comporting not just with traditional under-\nstandings of redressability but also with basic logic.  As \nthen-Judge Kavanaugh put it, if \u201cthe Government pro-\nhibits or impedes Company A from using Company B\u2019s \nproduct,\u201d there is \u201cordinarily little question\u201d that Com-\npany B has standing, since Company B\u2019s product is the \nvery \u201cobject\u201d of the regulation.  Energy Future Coal., \n793 F.3d at 144.  Company B is being deprived of the \n\u201copportunity to compete in the marketplace,\u201d so a fa-\nvorable judicial decision will provide at least some re-\ndress.  Ibid.  Or as this Court has succinctly recognized, \nif a regulatory program causes an injury in fact, \u201c[i]t \nfollows\u201d that \u201ca judicial decree directing [the govern-\nment] to discontinue its program would \u2018redress\u2019 the \ninjury.\u201d  Northeastern Fla. Chapter of Associated Gen. \nConts. of Am. v. City of Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656, 666 \nn.5 (1993).  \n2. California\u2019s standards impose a new  \nregulatory hurdle to the use of petitioners\u2019 \nproducts  \nThe above rule\u2014that removal of a regulatory hurdle \nto the use of a challenger\u2019s product satisfies Article III\u2019s \nredressability requirement\u2014resolves this case.  Peti-\ntioners\u2019 injuries arise from the \u201cdeterminative or coer-\ncive effect\u201d of California\u2019s standards (allowed to go into \neffect by EPA) on third-party automakers.  Bennett, \n520 U.S. at 169.  Although California\u2019s standards do not \ndirectly impose obligations on petitioners, the stand-\nards require somebody else to make vehicles that use \nless of petitioners\u2019 products.  It should be irrelevant \nthat the requirement technically operates on automak-\ners; the government is simply reducing the use of liquid \n\n29 \n \nfuel by regulating the assembly line rather than the gas \npump.   \nAgain, the Advanced Clean Cars program includes \ntwo mechanisms that directly prevent market partici-\npants from consuming as much of petitioners\u2019 products \nas they otherwise might.  First, California\u2019s zero- \nemission-vehicle mandate requires automakers to pro-\nduce an increasing percentage of vehicles that consume \nno liquid fuel.  Second, California\u2019s greenhouse-gas \nemission standards require automakers to produce ve-\nhicles with increased fuel efficiency\u2014with a corre-\nsponding reduction in the use of liquid fuel.  Under ei-\nther mechanism, California\u2019s standards pose a legal \nbarrier to the use of petitioners\u2019 products.  In fact, Cal-\nifornia predicted that \u201c[t]he oil and gas industry, fuel \nproviders, and service stations are likely to be the most \nadversely affected by the proposed Advanced Clean \nCars program due to the substantial reductions in de-\nmand for gasoline.\u201d  J.A. 13.  Petitioners are therefore \nbeing denied the \u201copportunity to compete in the mar-\nketplace\u201d without California\u2019s interference.  Energy \nFuture Coal., 793 F.3d at 144.  Under this Court\u2019s cases \nand a traditional understanding of redressability, no \nmore record evidence is needed. \nB. Petitioners Have Established Redressability  \nBecause They Can Rely On The Predictable  \nEffect Of Emission Standards  \nEven if this Court does not apply a categorical rule \nbased on the removal of a regulatory hurdle to petition-\ners\u2019 products, petitioners can still establish redressa-\nbility through case-specific inferences about third-\nparty conduct.  Article III does not demand certainty; \nit requires that the requested remedy will likely re-\ndress petitioners\u2019 injuries.  That standard is satisfied \n\n30 \n \nhere, where the behavior of third parties is predictable \nrather than speculative. \n1. Litigants can rely on common sense  \nand basic economics to demonstrate  \nredressability \nIndirectly regulated parties have traditionally sat-\nisfied Article III\u2019s redressability requirement so long \nas the conduct of directly regulated parties is reasona-\nbly predictable.  If it is, then a favorable judicial deci-\nsion would \u201clikely\u201d redress injuries inflicted as a result \nof that third party\u2019s action\u2014which is what Article III \nrequires.  Davis v. Federal Election Comm\u2019n, 554 U.S. \n724, 733 (2008).  A contrary rule would shield from ju-\ndicial scrutiny many government actions aimed at indi-\nrectly regulated, but undeniably injured, parties. \na. When a plaintiff\u2019s injury arises from \u201cthe unfet-\ntered choices made by independent actors,\u201d a plaintiff \nmust show that the third party will behave in such a \nway as to \u201cpermit redressability of injury.\u201d  Lujan, \n504 U.S. at 562 (citation omitted).  In applying that \nrule, this Court has repeatedly distinguished between \nreliance on speculative third-party actions and reliance \non predictable third-party behavior.  Record evidence \nis required to bolster the former but not the latter. \nWhen third-party behavior is predictable, com-\nmonsense inferences can suffice.  This Court held as \nmuch in Department of Commerce, 588 U.S. 752.  \nThere, the Court concluded that a group of States with \na disproportionate share of noncitizens had standing to \nchallenge the inclusion of a citizenship question in the \ncensus.  Id. at 767.  Although the States\u2019 harm \u201cde-\npend[ed] on the independent action of third parties\u201d\u2014\nthe noncitizens living in those States\u2014it was \u201cpredict-\nable\u201d that noncitizens would be \u201creluctan[t] to answer \n\n31 \n \na citizenship question\u201d and thus potentially not re-\nspond at all.  Id. at 767-768.  The depressed population \ncount, in turn, could result in a diversion of resources \nfrom the State challengers.  Id. at 767.  The Court ac-\ncepted that predictable chain of events based on com-\nmon sense and historical practice.  Id. at 768.  It did not \nrequire the challengers to gather, for example, affida-\nvits from noncitizens asserting that they would not re-\nspond to a census with a citizenship question. \nAlthough Department of Commerce focused on cau-\nsation, its reasoning applies equally to Article III\u2019s re-\ndressability requirement.  After all, \u201ccausation and re-\ndressability . . . are often \u2018flip sides of the same coin.\u2019  \u201d  \nAlliance for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 380 (quot-\ning Sprint Commc\u2019ns Co. v. APCC Servs., Inc.,  \n554 U.S. 269, 288 (2008)).  For that reason, lower courts \nhave found Article III\u2019s redressability requirement \nsatisfied based on the predictable response of a third \nparty to a judicial decision in the plaintiff\u2019s favor.  See, \ne.g., Skyline Wesleyan Church v. California Dep\u2019t of \nManaged Health Care, 968 F.3d 738, 749-750 (9th Cir. \n2020). \nIndeed, this Court applied similar reasoning in \nMassachusetts v. EPA, when it determined that Mas-\nsachusetts satisfied Article III\u2019s redressability re-\nquirement by looking to the predictable effect on global \nclimate change of requiring EPA to regulate  \ngreenhouse-gas emissions.  549 U.S. at 525-526.  In \nfinding redressability, the Court attached \u201cconsidera-\nble significance\u201d to EPA\u2019s own statements about its \nregulatory priorities, which suggested that ordering \nEPA to set emission standards would cause fewer ve-\nhicle emissions and therefore redress petitioners\u2019 inju-\nries.  Id. at 526.  That is, the Court found that an effect \n\n32 \n \nis predictable, and sufficient to establish redressabil-\nity, when the agency itself presupposes that effect. \nb. By contrast, redressability cannot rest on mere \nspeculation.  This Court has articulated three circum-\nstances where relief is too speculative to satisfy the de-\nmands of Article III.  None is applicable here. \nFirst, when a plaintiff\u2019s causation or redressability \ntheory relies on \u201ccounterintuitive\u201d assumptions about \nthird-party behavior, the plaintiff may need to support \nthat theory with \u201cstronger evidence.\u201d  California, \n593 U.S. at 678.  That was true in California, where the \nState challengers failed to establish redressability be-\ncause they sought to attack a government healthcare \nmandate that lacked any enforcement mechanism.  The \nCourt found it \u201ccounterintuitive\u201d \u201cthat an unenforcea-\nble mandate will cause [the States\u2019] residents to enroll \nin valuable benefits programs that they would other-\nwise forgo,\u201d so the Court required \u201cstronger evidence\u201d \nthat the mandate would actually have such an effect.  \nIbid. \nSecond, redressability may also be too speculative if \na plaintiff relies on a chain of events with thin links be-\ntween them.  For example, in Alliance for Hippocratic \nMedicine, the plaintiffs relied on overly \u201ccomplicated \ncausation theories\u201d to establish their standing to sue.  \n602 U.S. at 386.  The plaintiff doctors claimed that they \nsuffered increased costs or potential liability as a result \nof the FDA\u2019s decisions to relax mifepristone regula-\ntions.  Id. at 387.  But the doctors would first have to \nexperience \u201can increase in the number of pregnant \nwomen seeking treatment\u201d for mifepristone complica-\ntions, and then those treatments would have to result \nin the doctors\u2019 being \u201csued or required to pay higher \ninsurance costs.\u201d  Id. at 391-392.  More \u201cevidence\u201d was \n\n33 \n \nneeded to prove that this chain of events was likely to \noccur.  Id. at 391.  \nThird, if the legal impact of a judicial decision is un-\nclear, redressability may be too speculative.  That was \ntrue in Brackeen, where the challenged statute was en-\nforced by non-party state officials, not the federal de-\nfendants.  As a result, this Court\u2019s opinion could at best \nserve \nas \na \n\u201cpersuasive . . . advisory \nopinion[].\u201d  \n599 U.S. at 294 (citations omitted).  A similar problem \nexisted in United States v. Texas, where the challenged \nguidelines \u201cmerely advise[d] federal officials about \nhow to exercise their prosecutorial discretion when it \ncomes to deciding which aliens to prioritize for arrest \nand removal.\u201d  599 U.S. at 691 (Gorsuch, J., concurring \nin the judgment).  And in Murthy v. Missouri, the gov-\nernment action had concluded by the time the suit was \nbrought, so a judicial decision also served a purely ad-\nvisory function.  603 U.S. 43, 72-73 (2024).  In all those \ncases, additional evidence was required to establish re-\ndressability not because the federal government was \nregulating a third party but because it was not actively \nregulating at all. \nc. The distinction between predictable effects \n(which do not require record evidence) and counterin-\ntuitive or unlikely effects (which do) is especially im-\nportant for lawsuits brought by indirectly regulated \nparties. \nThe Court reinforced this point just last Term in Al-\nliance for Hippocratic Medicine.  Even as it disap-\nproved the particular plaintiffs\u2019 standing theories, the \nCourt acknowledged \u201ca variety of familiar circum-\nstances where government regulation of a third-party \nindividual or business may be likely to cause injury in \nfact to an unregulated plaintiff.\u201d  602 U.S. at 384.  For \nexample, it is predictable that government regulation \n\n34 \n \nof one business \u201cmay cause downstream or upstream \neconomic injuries to others in the chain.\u201d  Ibid. (citing \nNational Credit Union Admin. v. First Nat\u2019l Bank & \nTrust Co., 522 U.S. 479, 488 n.4 (1998); General Motors \nCorp. v. Tracy, 519 U.S. 278, 286-287 (1997); Barlow  \nv. Collins, 397 U.S. 159, 162-164 (1970); and Associa-\ntion of Data Processing Serv. Orgs., Inc. v. Camp, 397 \nU.S. 150, 152 (1970)).  And it is predictable that when \nthe government \u201cregulates parks, national forests, or \nbodies of water,\u201d it will affect the users of those natural \nresources.  Id. at 385 (citing Summers v. Earth Island \nInst., 555 U.S. 488, 494 (2009)).  \u201cThe list goes on.\u201d  \nIbid. (citing Department of Commerce, 588 U.S. at 766-\n768).  In all such cases, plaintiffs rely on \u201ca predictable \nchain of events leading from the government action to \nthe asserted injury.\u201d  Ibid. \n2. Automakers would predictably adjust \ntheir fleets if EPA\u2019s waiver were vacated  \nThe effect of EPA\u2019s waiver on automakers is more \nthan predictable; it is obvious.  EPA\u2019s waiver puts in \nplace California\u2019s Advanced Clean Cars standards.  \nThose standards are specifically designed to reduce the \nnumber of conventional, liquid-fuel-powered vehicles \nthat would otherwise be produced.  J.A. 110, 115-116.  \nAnd no one has disputed that automakers have histor-\nically responded to California\u2019s greenhouse-gas emis-\nsion and zero-emission-vehicle standards by selling \nfewer conventional vehicles.  See 78 Fed. Reg. at 2,141-\n2,142.  After all, if that were not the historical response, \nCalifornia \u201cwould presumably not bother with such ef-\nforts.\u201d  Massachusetts, 549 U.S. at 526 (citation omit-\nted).   \nIn continuing to defend its standards, California has \nconfirmed that it is intentionally trying to reduce de-\n\n35 \n \nmand for petitioners\u2019 products.  California has repeat-\nedly told EPA that the State wants its greenhouse-gas \nemission standards to reduce the emissions that come \nfrom burning liquid fuel.  It has explained that its \nstandards increase the number of electric vehicles in \nuse, thereby avoiding the \u201cproduction and delivery of \ngasoline.\u201d  J.A. 84.  And California represented to EPA \nthat the standards were \u201ccritical not just for immediate \nemissions reductions but also\u201d for \u201cgreater emission \nreductions in the future.\u201d  J.A. 66.  If regulations are \n\u201ccritical\u201d in the government\u2019s telling, surely litigants \ncan reasonably predict that they will have some effect. \nThe bottom line here is unavoidable.  If EPA\u2019s \nwaiver is vacated, California can no longer force au-\ntomakers to make more electric vehicles or higher- \nefficiency vehicles than they would otherwise produce \nin response to market forces.  Free of government in-\nterference, automakers will respond to market de-\nmand, including by making more vehicles that run on \nmore liquid fuel or by adjusting their distribution plans \nor prices in ways that will result in more liquid-fuel-\npowered vehicle sales.  That theory of automaker be-\nhavior is far from speculative.  It is Economics 101. \nC. The \nCourt \nOf \nAppeals\u2019 \nRedressability  \nAnalysis Is Wrong \nUnder the principles discussed above, the redressa-\nbility inquiry should have been straightforward in this \ncase.  Vacating EPA\u2019s waiver would remove a legal ob-\nstacle to the use of petitioners\u2019 products, and au-\ntomaker behavior is predictable in any event.  Yet the \ncourt of appeals blinded itself to the obvious.  It con-\ncluded that petitioners do not have Article III standing \nby creating artificially high evidentiary barriers to es-\ntablishing redressability.  In so doing, the court made \n\n36 \n \nit nearly impossible for many parties indirectly af-\nfected by government action to secure judicial relief, \nand created incentives for government gamesmanship. \n1. The decision below contradicts this \nCourt\u2019s precedents and common sense  \na. The court of appeals overstated petitioners\u2019 bur-\nden to establish redressability.  Although the court \nacknowledged that it was \u201cpossible\u201d automakers would \nchange their plans and sell more liquid-fuel-powered \nvehicles or vehicles that use more liquid fuel if EPA\u2019s \nwaiver were vacated, it faulted petitioners for failing to \nsupply \u201crecord evidence\u201d to that effect, such as \u201caddi-\ntional affidavits.\u201d  Pet. App. 24a (internal quotation \nmarks omitted).  In the court\u2019s view, it was just as \nlikely that California\u2019s standards have no real-world \nimpact because some manufacturers are already sell-\ning \u201cmore qualifying vehicles in California than the \nState\u2019s standards require.\u201d  Id. at 28a (emphasis omit-\nted) (quoting J.A. 202).  And the court believed that \n\u201cunsupported assumptions regarding the future ac-\ntions of third-party market participants are insuffi-\ncient to establish Article III standing\u201d\u2014full stop.  Id. \nat 29a (internal quotation marks omitted). \nAs explained, the court of appeals\u2019 categorical evi-\ndentiary demand is doubly wrong.  First, it departs \nfrom Bennett and the D.C. Circuit\u2019s own precedent es-\ntablishing that the removal of a regulatory hurdle to \nthe use of the challenger\u2019s product satisfies redressa-\nbility.  See pp. 25-29, supra.  Indeed, the court of ap-\npeals did not even acknowledge its precedent holding \nthat \u201cremov[ing] a regulatory hurdle\u201d to the use of fuel \nsuffices to establish redressability.  Energy Future \nCoal., 793 F.3d at 144.  And second, petitioners were at \nleast entitled to rely on common sense:  automakers \nwould predictably produce more vehicles that use more \n\n37 \n \nliquid fuel if no longer subject to standards mandating \nthe production of certain quantities of electric or fuel-\nefficient vehicles.  See pp. 29-35, supra.   \nNor could the court of appeals rely on supposed \nmarket forces to justify its heightened redressability \nburden.  The limited evidence the court invoked sup-\nported the opposite conclusion.  The court relied on \nCalifornia\u2019s declaration explaining that automakers \nhad sold more electric vehicles than required in 2022\u2014\nlikely in anticipation of the increasingly stringent \nstandards for the ensuing years.  Pet. App. 28a (citing \nJ.A. 202).  That says nothing about how automakers \nwould respond if they did not need to meet California\u2019s \nstandards ever again.  The court also highlighted that \nthe intervening automakers had suggested that \u201cinter-\nnal sustainability forces and external market forces\u201d \nwere resulting in the production of more electric vehi-\ncles.  Id. at 24a n.8 (quoting C.A. Industry Resp.-Int. \nBr. 6-7).  But those automakers never said that every \nautomaker would exceed California\u2019s standards if the \nstandards were vacated.  To the contrary, as petition-\ners explained in reply, five individual automakers in-\ntervened precisely because a decision vacating the \nwaiver would put them at a \u201ccompetitive disad-\nvantage.\u201d  J.A. 211 (quoting C.A. Industry Resp.-Int. \nBr. 17).  That is, those five individual automakers were \nconcerned that other automakers\u2014many of whom have \nremained silent throughout this litigation\u2014would pull \nback their electric-vehicle numbers and instead sell \nmore liquid-fuel-powered vehicles.   \nb.  Even if petitioners were legally required to pro-\nduce record evidence to support redressability, plenty \nsuch evidence existed.  The record included 14 declara-\ntions explaining how California\u2019s standards depress de-\nmand for liquid fuel, and how petitioners\u2019 injuries \n\n38 \n \nwould be ameliorated if the waiver were vacated.  \nOther declarants further noted that California itself \nhad recently projected that the waiver would \u201creduce \nemissions through reductions in fuel production.\u201d  J.A. \n148 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see \nJ.A. 180; see also J.A. 174 (similar statements by Min-\nnesota, which has adopted California\u2019s standards).  Ad-\nditional record evidence likewise documented Califor-\nnia\u2019s position that it needs its greenhouse-gas stand-\nards to reduce motor-vehicle emissions and that doing \nso decreases liquid-fuel consumption.  That included \nCalifornia\u2019s 2021 comment representing that its stand-\nards are \u201ccritical not just for immediate emissions re-\nductions but also\u201d for \u201cgreater emission reductions in \nthe future.\u201d  J.A. 66.  And California elsewhere had \npublicly explained that the standards increase the \nnumber of electric vehicles in use, thereby avoiding \n\u201cproduction and delivery of gasoline.\u201d  J.A. 84.   \nNone of this evidence was enough for the court of \nappeals.  In context, the court apparently thought that \npetitioners could meet their burden of showing re-\ndressability only by providing affidavits from automak-\ners promising to change production or pricing if the \nwaiver were vacated.  This Court has never required \nthe endorsement of a directly regulated third party be-\nfore an indirectly regulated party can sue, and it should \nnot create such a rule now.  Doing so would make it \nimpossible for many parties indirectly affected by gov-\nernment action to secure judicial relief and would cre-\nate incentives for government gamesmanship.  See  \npp. 41-45, infra.  \n\n39 \n \n2. The \ndecision \nbelow \nconflates  \nredressability with mootness \nThe decision below creates additional doctrinal con-\nfusion because it conflates mootness and redressabil-\nity.  The court of appeals thought that the redressabil-\nity inquiry here was \u201cfurther complicated by the rela-\ntively short duration of the waiver.\u201d  Pet. App. 22a.  As \nthe court saw it, petitioners needed to demonstrate not \nonly that manufacturers were likely to respond to a ju-\ndicial decision vacating the waiver by \u201cchanging their \nfleets,\u201d but also that they \u201cwould do so relatively \nquickly\u2014by Model Year 2025\u201d\u2014the year in which the \ncourt believed EPA\u2019s waiver terminated.  Id. at 23a.  In \nthe court\u2019s view, because vehicle product cycles \u201ccan \nalso begin years before a vehicle is launched,\u201d it was \n\u201cfar from clear\u201d that automakers could \u201cchange \ncourse . . . within the model years covered by the \nwaiver.\u201d  Id. at 24a. \nThose (misplaced) timing concerns sound in moot-\nness, not redressability.  Redressability, like the other \nelements of standing, is assessed at the time the suit is \nfiled.  See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 569 n.4.  Here, petitioners \nbrought suit immediately after EPA\u2019s waiver rein-\nstatement in 2022.  At that point, the waiver was sched-\nuled to be in effect for nearly four years.  There was \nample evidence in the record that automakers are at \nleast nimble enough to change a production choice or a \nvehicle price four years in advance\u2014surely enough to \naffect a single dollar of petitioners\u2019 sales.  See pp. 37-\n38, supra; J.A. 209-211.  Indeed, the court of appeals \nrelied on a comment from Toyota explaining that some \nmanufacturers were producing their vehicle fleets one \nyear in advance\u2014which affirmatively undermines the \nnotion that no manufacturer could change plans four \nyears in advance.  Pet. App. 24a; see J.A. 98-100. \n\n40 \n \nGiven that context, the court\u2019s emphasis on the \u201crel-\natively short nature of the waiver\u201d makes sense only as \na concern that the case was approaching model year \n2025 still unresolved.  Pet. App. 25a; see C.A. Oral Arg. \n34:46-34:49 (Garcia, J.) (\u201c[Y]ou need about two more \nyears to plan and adjust how you\u2019re producing vehicles, \nand I don\u2019t see how we can assume that\u2019s going to hap-\npen by model year [20]25.\u201d).  But it \u201cis the doctrine of \nmootness, not standing, that addresses whether \u2018an in-\ntervening circumstance has deprived the plaintiff of a \npersonal stake in the outcome of the lawsuit.\u2019  \u201d  West \nVirginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, 719 (2022) (quoting \nGenesis HealthCare Corp. v. Symczyk, 569 U.S. 66, 72 \n(2013)).  Indeed, the federal government recently ex-\nplained to this Court that when its regulations operate \non a short time horizon, Article III concerns should be \nevaluated under the rubric of mootness, not redressa-\nbility.  See FCC Br. 14, FCC v. Consumers\u2019 Research, \nNo. 24-354 (explaining that the mootness doctrine ap-\nplies when \u201cthe challenged action is in its duration too \nshort to be fully litigated\u201d) (citation omitted). \nThat \u201cdistinction matters\u201d for several reasons.  \nWest Virginia, 597 U.S. at 719.  First, although plain-\ntiffs have the burden to establish Article III standing, \nthe burden flips for mootness.  EPA thus would \u201cbear[] \nthe burden to establish that a once-live case has be-\ncome moot.\u201d  Ibid.  And neither intervenors nor EPA \npointed the court of appeals to evidence sufficient to \nshow that automakers\u2019 decisions have become irrevo-\ncable.  Because the court misconstrued its mootness \nconcern as a redressability obstacle, they had no need \nto.   \nSecond, because mootness would have been a new \ndevelopment, the court below would have had to con-\n\n41 \n \nsider the supplemental record evidence that petition-\ners offered.  Counsel for the state and local government \nintervenors made arguments sounding in mootness for \nthe first time at oral argument.  In response, petition-\ners submitted supplemental declarations from individ-\nuals experienced in vehicle-emission compliance.  \nThose declarations explained that \u201cautomobile manu-\nfacturers could and likely would change their produc-\ntion, pricing, and/or distribution plans for Model Year \n2025 as late as December 2025, but at a minimum well \ninto 2025.\u201d  J.A. 215, 220.  But the court rejected peti-\ntioners\u2019 supplemental brief and accompanying declara-\ntions as too late to show redressability.  Pet. App. 31a.  \nHad the court properly characterized California\u2019s ar-\nguments as newly raised concerns about mootness, \nthere would have been no doubt about the propriety of \npetitioners\u2019 supplemental responses.   \nThird, and critically, mootness doctrine contains ex-\nceptions that redressability does not.  In particular, if \nthere is a concern about the \u201crelatively short nature of \nthe waiver,\u201d Pet. App. 25a, then the case would be an \nexcellent candidate for applying \u201cthe established ex-\nception to mootness for disputes capable of repetition, \nyet evading review.\u201d  Federal Election Comm\u2019n v. Wis-\nconsin Right To Life, Inc., 551 U.S. 449, 462 (2007).  \nBut if that concern is improperly characterized as go-\ning to redressability, the challengers are out of luck.   \n3. The decision below creates bad policy \nThe decision below stacks bad policy on top of bad \nlaw.  It would put injured businesses at the mercy of \nregulated third parties whose interests may not align, \nincentivize agency mischief, and create a one-way \nratchet in favor of regulators over the regulated. \n\n42 \n \na. To start, the court of appeals\u2019 rule means that in-\ndirectly regulated entities will often be unable to chal-\nlenge government action that undeniably injures them.  \nThat is because an indirectly regulated entity\u2019s stand-\ning will often depend on the actions of directly regu-\nlated parties.  And the interests of directly regulated \nparties and downstream or upstream entities often di-\nverge.  That was the case where \u201cworkers challenged a \nDepartment of Labor rule that unlawfully allowed em-\nployers to access inexpensive foreign labor, with the ef-\nfect of lowering American workers\u2019 wages.\u201d  Corner \nPost, 603 U.S. at 836 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring) (cit-\ning Mendoza v. Perez, 754 F.3d 1002 (D.C. Cir. 2014)).  \nIt is also the case where a business challenges under-\nregulation of a competitor.  See, e.g., Monsanto Co.  \nv. Geertson Seed Farms, 561 U.S. 139, 153-156 (2010) \n(conventional alfalfa farmers had standing to challenge \nderegulation of genetically modified alfalfa); General \nMotors Corp., 519 U.S. at 282, 286-287 (purchaser of \nnatural gas had standing to challenge Ohio\u2019s differen-\ntial tax treatment of gas sales by certain Ohio utilities \nand gas sales by out-of-state sellers).  Justiciable \nclaims of under-regulation may also come from outside \nthe industry, as when insurance companies challenged \nthe recission of vehicle safety standards.  See Motor \nVehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of U.S. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. \nIns. Co., 463 U.S. 29 (1983). \nEven when directly regulated entities and upstream \nor downstream entities are not squarely at odds, other \nconsiderations might prevent a regulated party from \njoining the effort to challenge government action.  \nMembers of the directly regulated industry may be \nmore minimally burdened by an action than down-\nstream actors.  The regulated entity may be unwilling \n\n43 \n \nto risk negative publicity by challenging a popular gov-\nernment action, especially if it has less at stake.  The \ngovernment may have effectively purchased the regu-\nlated entity\u2019s cooperation by doling out countervailing \nregulatory benefits.  Or businesses might simply lack \nthe appetite to confront their regulator in court.   \nThose risks are particularly acute in industries that \nrequire lead time to comply with standards.  In such \nindustries, regulated entities may prefer to cooperate \nwith the agency in exchange for certainty about the fu-\nture regulatory environment or other benefits. The \nagency action may still have sweeping effect, but the \nonly viable plaintiffs would have no incentive to bring \nsuit.  That was true here, where automakers had incen-\ntives to cooperate with EPA and California to obtain \nregulatory stability and to avoid the perceived negative \npublicity of interfering with California\u2019s environmental \nefforts.  In short, one industry should not be held hos-\ntage to a related industry\u2019s incentives.   \nb. The decision below creates troubling incentives \nfor agencies, too.  It teaches agencies that they can tar-\nget entire industries with crippling burdens so long as \nthey act through a conduit and placate that conduit.  \nHere, EPA, California, and several automakers en-\ntered into \u201cCalifornia Framework Agreements\u201d com-\nmitting the automakers to accede to California\u2019s stand-\nards in exchange for certain benefits like additional \nlead time.  CARB, Framework Agreements on Clean \nCars (Aug. 17, 2020), https://perma.cc/ZM4Z-GDEK.  \nHaving entered into those agreements, the select au-\ntomakers that intervened in this case were forced into \ndefending California\u2019s standards, lest they be left to \ncompete in a market undisturbed by California\u2019s artifi-\ncial distortions.  But appeasing the directly regulated \nindustry should not insulate agency action from review, \n\n44 \n \nparticularly if that action cripples numerous other in-\ndustries.  \nA too-demanding redressability standard may also \nencourage agencies to act over shorter time horizons to \navoid meaningful review.  Under the reasoning of the \ncourt below, EPA\u2019s latest waiver decision was effec-\ntively unchallengeable because it applied \u201conly\u201d over \nfour years.  Pet. App. 22a.  That reasoning would have \nthe perverse effect of shielding from review the most \nimportant and politically sensitive issues on which \npresidential administrations may disagree.  See, e.g., \nWest Virginia, 597 U.S. at 715-718 (describing the his-\ntory of EPA\u2019s Clean Power Plan across presidential ad-\nministrations).  California\u2019s Section 209(b) waivers for \nclimate-change-focused standards are a perfect exam-\nple:  EPA has granted or rescinded a waiver like clock-\nwork with each change in administration.  An inflated \nredressability standard all but guarantees that these \ncourse-changes mean that agency authority is never \nsettled, even in the most consequential cases.   \nc. Finally, the decision below creates a one-way \nratchet in favor of the regulator over the regulated.  A \nState will always have \u201ca legitimate interest in the con-\ntinued enforceability of its own statutes,\u201d regardless of \ntheir effects.  Maine v. Taylor, 477 U.S. 131, 137 (1986).  \nA State\u2019s interest in vindicating its laws would presum-\nably allow California to challenge or intervene to de-\nfend any decision granting or denying a waiver.  See \nC.A. State & Local Gov. Intervention Mot. 10 (citing \nAlaska v. Department of Transp., 868 F.2d 441, 444 \n(D.C. Cir. 1989)).  As California puts it, with EPA\u2019s \n\u201cwaiver, its standards have legal force; without it, they \ndo not,\u201d so it need not show that the waiver influences \nthe \u201cmix of cars.\u201d  Cal. Br. in Opp. 14 n.5 (citing Alli-\nance for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 382).  But under \n\n45 \n \nthe court of appeals\u2019 theory, industries targeted by \nCalifornia\u2019s laws have no such luck.   \nD. At \nThe \nVery \nLeast, \nPetitioners \nHave  \nEstablished \nRedressability \nBecause \nThe \nChallenged Waiver Continues In Perpetuity  \nIf there were any doubt that petitioners\u2019 injuries are \nredressable, EPA\u2019s recent admission that its waiver \nhas no definite end point should remove it.  Even under \nthe court of appeals\u2019 unduly high bar for redressability, \npetitioners have standing to challenge what EPA now \nfreely describes as an open-ended waiver allowing Cal-\nifornia to impose emission standards in perpetuity.  \n1.  The court of appeals\u2019 standing analysis was \npremised on its assumption that the waiver, and thus \nCalifornia\u2019s standards, would sunset after 2025.  Pet. \nApp. 14a, 22a.  As noted, the court viewed the \u201crela-\ntively short duration of the waiver\u201d as \u201ccomplicat[ing]\u201d \nthe redressability analysis.  Id. at 22a.  According to \nthe court, petitioners needed to demonstrate not only \nthat manufacturers were likely to respond to a judicial \ndecision vacating the waiver by \u201cchanging their fleets,\u201d \nbut also that manufacturers would do so \u201crelatively \nquickly\u2014by Model Year 2025.\u201d  Id. at 23a (emphasis \nadded).  And the court found it \u201cfar from clear\u201d that \nmanufacturers would change their prices or production \ncycles by model year 2025.  Id. at 24a.  \nEPA has now admitted that the D.C. Circuit\u2019s cen-\ntral premise was incorrect.  In opposing certiorari, \nEPA candidly explained that its waiver has no end \ndate.  See EPA Br. in Opp. 12-13.  \u201cContrary to the \ncourt of appeals\u2019 suggestion,\u201d EPA told this Court, the \nwaiver \u201cdoes not expire after model-year 2025.\u201d  Id. at \n12.  When this lawsuit was filed, both the zero- \nemission-vehicle mandate and the greenhouse-gas \nemission standards applied to model year 2025 \u201cand \n\n46 \n \nsubsequent.\u201d  J.A 50 (emphasis added).  In 2022, after \npetitioners sued, California amended its zero-emission-\nvehicle mandate to sunset after model year 2025.  See \np. 16, supra.  But California\u2019s greenhouse-gas emission \nstandards continue to \u201cremain in force\u201d after model \nyear 2025.  EPA Br. in Opp. 13.  So in approving the \nwaiver, EPA approved standards that do not expire un-\nless California chooses to replace them, which it has \nnot done for its greenhouse-gas standards. \nAfter this certiorari petition was fully briefed, EPA \nformalized its position that California\u2019s greenhouse-\ngas emission standards do not sunset.  In its December \n17, 2024 decision granting California\u2019s waiver request \nfor its new Advanced Clean Cars II standards, EPA \nexplained that California\u2019s \u201c[greenhouse-gas] emission \nstandards applicable to 2025 and subsequent model \nyears remain[] unchanged.\u201d  ACC II Decision Docu-\nment 40 n.96.  Those emission standards did not need \nany further approval from EPA; they \u201ccontinue to be \ncovered by EPA\u2019s [Advanced Clean Cars] I waiver is-\nsued in 2013 . . . and reinstated in 2022.\u201d  Ibid. \n2. Given EPA\u2019s newly articulated position, it should \nbe beyond question that vacating the challenged waiver \nwould ameliorate petitioners\u2019 injuries at least to some \ndegree.  Even if the court of appeals were right that it \nwould take several years for every automaker to \nchange its production cycle, Pet. App. 23a, some of the \nrelevant standards are set to govern for more than sev-\neral years.  In other words, while the court below wor-\nried that vehicle manufacturers could not change \ncourse \u201cquickly\u201d enough, ibid., speed should not have \nbeen a concern.  Vacating an indefinite waiver permit-\nting California to enforce stringent emission standards \nwould necessarily have some effect on vehicle pricing, \nproduction, or distribution at some future point\u2014\n\n47 \n \nthereby alleviating at least one dollar of the artificially \ndepressed demand for petitioners\u2019 products.   \nCalifornia and EPA have since made factual find-\nings confirming that the perpetual greenhouse-gas \nemission standards will depress demand for liquid fuel \ninto the next decade.  In recently proposing to approve \nCalifornia\u2019s request to revise its state implementation \nplan, EPA accepted California\u2019s prediction that its \ngreenhouse-gas standards would \u201cachieve additional \ncriteria pollutant emission reductions\u201d in the State \nthrough at least 2037.  89 Fed. Reg. at 82,557 & n.19 \n(citing J.A. 93-94).  Citing the same analysis it had sub-\nmitted when urging EPA to reinstate the challenged \nwaiver, California reiterated that its greenhouse-gas \nemission standards target liquid fuel.  Specifically, Cal-\nifornia attributed the criteria-pollutant reductions to \nthe \u201cavoided production and delivery of gasoline\u201d from \nautomakers\u2019 compliance with those ongoing standards.  \nId. at 82,559 & n.37 (citing J.A. 84).  That analysis\u2014\nembraced by EPA as \u201creasonable and adequately  \nsupported\u201d\u2014recognizes that California\u2019s greenhouse-\ngas emission standards will continue to affect liquid-\nfuel consumption for more than a decade.  Id. at 82,558.  \nAt least one automaker is likely to adjust a single pro-\nduction or pricing decision over that period.   \n* * * \nThis case really is this simple:  petitioners make and \nsell liquid fuels.  EPA\u2019s waiver allows California to en-\nforce standards requiring fewer cars that run on liquid \nfuel.  Indeed, California\u2019s goal is to eliminate reliance \non petitioners\u2019 products entirely.  Removing EPA\u2019s \nwaiver would thus likely cause at least a single cus-\ntomer to purchase at least a dollar\u2019s worth more of pe-\ntitioners\u2019 products.  The legality of EPA\u2019s actions may \n\n48 \n \nraise controversial statutory or political questions, but \ntheir justiciability should never have been in doubt.   \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, this Court should  \nreverse the judgment below. \n \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nERIC D.

The key factual issue complicating redressability is whether automakers will continue producing EVs for independent market reasons even if the waiver is vacated. This search action is exceptionally well-targeted to address this dispositive issue. \n\nTask EIG is very high (0.9) because the query ('standing redressability market automakers voluntary') and the filter ('brief of respondent') are designed to retrieve the core arguments that the Supreme Court must grapple with to decide the case. Understanding the respondent's framing of the market forces and voluntary automaker actions is critical to predicting whether the Court will agree with the D.C. Circuit or find that the injury is redressable. This information will directly shape the prediction.\n\nDesign EIG is also high (0.8) because this action exemplifies a crucial strategic step: moving from a general understanding of a case to a highly targeted inquiry into the specific legal and factual crux. It demonstrates how to use precise search terms and filters to isolate the arguments of a specific party on a dispositive issue. This is a powerful and generalizable strategy for analyzing cases that turn on fact-intensive threshold questions like standing.",

As their case progresses, they \nmust \u201cpoint to factual evidence\u201d establishing that they \nsatisfied the three elements of standing\u2014injury, cau-\nsation, and redressability\u2014as of the time they filed \nsuit.  Murthy v. Missouri, 603 U.S. 43, 57-58 (2024).  \nThe only question here is how to apply those long-set-\ntled requirements to the peculiar circumstances of this \ncase, involving a waiver of preemption under Section \n209(b) of the Clean Air Act. \nAs petitioners describe things, that question is \n\u201cstraightforward\u201d because standing is automatic here.  \nPet. Br. 35.  Petitioners profit from sales of fuel.  They \nnote that the waiver allowed California to impose \nstate standards limiting greenhouse-gas emissions \nacross automakers\u2019 fleets and requiring automakers to \nsell a certain percentage of zero-emission vehicles.  Pe-\ntitioners assert that \u201c[t]hey promptly challenged \nEPA\u2019s waiver,\u201d id. at 20; that the waiver injures peti-\ntioners and their members by \u201creduc[ing] the use of \nliquid fuel,\u201d id.; and that \u201c[s]etting aside EPA\u2019s waiver \nwould . . . end[] the artificial depression of demand for \npetitioners\u2019 products,\u201d id. at 20-21.  Standing was so \n\u201cobvious,\u201d in their view, that they did not \u201cneed to sup-\nply additional record evidence\u201d to establish redressa-\nbility.  Id. at 17, 18. \nBut \u201capplying the law of standing\u201d frequently de-\nmands a \u201cheavily fact-dependent\u201d inquiry, FDA v. All. \nfor Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 384 (2024), and pe-\ntitioners elide the most salient facts in this case.  EPA \ngranted the relevant waiver in 2013.  Petitioners did \nnot challenge that waiver and neither did anyone else.  \nIt remained in effect for more than six years before \n\n \n2 \n \nEPA withdrew it in 2019.  During those six years, in \nresponse to the state standards and wider national \nand global trends, automakers invested heavily in \nchanging their fleets and building consumer demand \nfor electric vehicles.  Consumer preferences and the \nautomobile market evolved.  Even when EPA with-\ndrew the waiver, automakers accelerated their transi-\ntion to electric vehicles and consumer demand \ncontinued to grow. \nIn 2021, when EPA invited comment on whether to \nreinstate the waiver, the state respondents supported \nreinstatement.  As their comment explained, the with-\ndrawal had exceeded EPA\u2019s authority and it deprived \nCalifornia\u2019s regulations of legal effect.  But by the time \nEPA reinstated the waiver and petitioners challenged \nthat decision in 2022, \u201c\u2018both internal sustainability \ngoals and external market forces\u2019\u201d were pushing \n\u201cmanufacturers to transition toward electric vehicles, \nirrespective of California\u2019s regulations.\u201d  Pet. App. 24a \nn.8.  Indeed, publicly available evidence submitted by \nthe state respondents showed that zero-emission vehi-\ncles sold in California in 2022 already exceeded what \nthe relevant standards required.  Consumers were \nwilling to pay substantial price premiums for those ve-\nhicles.  And automakers had strong incentives to keep \nselling them. \nWhen the court of appeals confronted petitioners\u2019 \nchallenge to the reinstatement, it had to assure itself \nof jurisdiction by evaluating whether vacatur of that \nreinstatement would likely lead automakers to make \nchoices that would redress petitioners\u2019 asserted injury.  \nGiven the circumstances when petitioners filed suit in \nMay 2022, would automakers change their fleets or \nprices in a way that would increase demand for peti-\ntioners\u2019 liquid-fuel products?  Or would automakers \n\n \n3 \n \nexceed the requirements of California\u2019s standards for \ntheir own economic and strategic reasons, even with-\nout a legal requirement to do so?  Petitioners submit-\nted no evidence addressing that critical issue.  And \ngiven that absence of proof, the court of appeals \nproperly held that petitioners failed to meet their bur-\nden of demonstrating redressability. \nPetitioners ask this Court to excuse that failure.  \nThey first urge the Court to adopt a new \u201ccategorical \nrule.\u201d  Pet. Br. 4.  Under that rule, redressability \nwould be established automatically whenever peti-\ntioners challenge a regulation that implicates the use \nof their products\u2014even if the regulation applies only \nto third parties, and even where petitioners introduce \nno evidence indicating that those third parties would \nhave acted differently in the regulation\u2019s absence.  Id.  \nIn the alternative, petitioners ask the Court to credit \ntheir unsubstantiated predictions about how au-\ntomakers might respond to a vacatur.  Id. at 30-35.  \nThose arguments find no support in this Court\u2019s prec-\nedent.  Adopting them would effectively eliminate the \nplaintiff\u2019s \u201cburden of showing that third parties will \nlikely react\u201d to a favorable judgment in a way that pro-\nvides redress.  Dep\u2019t of Com. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, \n768 (2019).  And they would allow a court to assume \nredressability even if all the evidence before it indi-\ncates that a favorable judgment would not, in fact, re-\ndress the plaintiffs\u2019 injury.  This Court should reject \npetitioners\u2019 novel standing theories and affirm the \njudgment below. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal and Regulatory Background \n1.  The Clean Air Act directs EPA to prescribe fed-\neral standards governing emissions of air pollutants \n\n \n4 \n \nfrom new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle en-\ngines.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7521.  Section 209(a) of the Act gen-\nerally preempts States and their political subdivisions \nfrom \u201cadopt[ing] or attempt[ing] to enforce any stand-\nard relating to the control of emissions from new mo-\ntor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines.\u201d  Id. \n\u00a7 7543(a).  But Section 209(b) instructs EPA to \u201cwaive \napplication of [Section 209] to any State which ha[d] \nadopted\u201d qualifying emission standards \u201cprior to \nMarch 30, 1966, if the State determines that the State \nstandards will be, in the aggregate, at least as protec-\ntive of public health and welfare as applicable Federal \nstandards.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7543(b)(1).  If a State makes that de-\ntermination, EPA must waive preemption unless it \nmakes one of three enumerated findings.  See id. \n\u00a7 7543(b)(1)(A)-(C). \nCalifornia is the only State eligible for a waiver un-\nder Section 209(b) because it was the only State that \nhad developed qualifying motor vehicle emissions \nstandards before March 30, 1966.  Pet. App. 7a.  \u201cCon-\ngress recognized that California was already the \n\u2018lead[er] in the establishment of standards for regula-\ntion of automative pollutant emissions\u2019 at a time when \nthe federal government had yet to promulgate any reg-\nulations of its own.\u201d  Engine Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 88 \nF.3d 1075, 1079 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  Congress designed \nSection 209 to allow California to continue to serve as \na \u201c\u2018laboratory for innovation,\u2019\u201d id. at 1080, while also \n\u201cavoid[ing] the economic disruption\u201d that would come \nfrom manufacturers \u201chaving to meet fifty-one separate \nsets of emission control requirements,\u201d Motor & \nEquip. Mfrs. Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. EPA, 627 F.2d 1095, 1109 \n(D.C. Cir. 1979); see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7507 (1977 \namendment allowing other States to adopt standards \n\u201cidentical to the California standards for which a \nwaiver has been granted for such model year\u201d); Pet. \n\n \n5 \n \nApp. 9a n.3 (noting that \u201cseventeen states have chosen \nto adopt some portion of the California regulations\u201d). \nCalifornia received its first waiver in 1968 and has \nreceived additional waivers in every subsequent dec-\nade.1  For instance, EPA granted a waiver in 1993 for \nCalifornia\u2019s first Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) regula-\ntion, which required a specific percentage of light-duty \nvehicles to be zero-emission vehicles with no exhaust \nor evaporative emissions.  58 Fed. Reg. 4166 (Jan. 13, \n1993).2  EPA granted another waiver, in 2009, for Cal-\nifornia\u2019s first set of regulations to control greenhouse-\ngas emissions from motor vehicles.  74 Fed. Reg. \n32,744 (July 8, 2009). \n2.  This litigation concerns a set of emissions \nstandards that California adopted in 2012 as part of \nits Advanced Clean Cars I program.  78 Fed. Reg. 2112 \n(Jan. 9, 2013).  As relevant here, those standards in-\ncluded a requirement that automakers reduce the av-\nerage greenhouse-gas emissions across the fleets of \nvehicles they sell in California.  See id. at 2114.  They \nalso included new ZEV standards, requiring manufac-\nturers to meet specified \u201cZEV credit percentage\u201d re-\nquirements.  Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(b) \n(2012).   \nA manufacturer can satisfy the \u201cZEV credit per-\ncentage\u201d in several ways:  by generating credits from \nsales of qualifying vehicles, purchasing credits from \nother manufacturers, using excess credits banked in \nprior years, or applying credits obtained by overcom-\n \n1 See EPA, Vehicle Emissions California Waivers and Authoriza-\ntions, https://tinyurl.com/3rxscztw (last visited Mar. 6, 2025). \n2  See Cal. Air Res. Bd., Low-Emission Vehicle Program,  \nhttps://tinyurl.com/49m28yze (last visited Mar. 6, 2025). \n\n \n6 \n \nplying with the greenhouse-gas emission require-\nments.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(d)(5); 78 \nFed. Reg. at 2119-2120, 2135.  The number of ZEV \ncredits generated by a vehicle sale depends on the ve-\nhicle\u2019s range when operating on electric power.  See \nCal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(d)(5).  For example, a \nplug-in hybrid vehicle with a \u201c50 mile\u201d electric range \nearns one credit, while a fully battery-electric vehicle \nwith a \u201c350 mile\u201d range earns four credits.3  As a re-\nsult, a fleet may satisfy the standards even though \nZEV sales as a percentage of light-duty vehicles sold \nis well below the applicable ZEV credit percentage re-\nquirement.  \nThe Advanced Clean Cars I standards affected \nmodel years beginning in 2017 (for greenhouse-gas \nemissions) and 2018 (for ZEV requirements).  Both \nsets of standards were originally structured to in-\ncrease in stringency through model year 2025 and re-\nmain in effect at 2025 levels for subsequent model \nyears.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1961.3(a)(1)(A) \n(2012); id. \u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2012); J.A. 50.  In 2022, \nhowever, California amended the ZEV standards (but \nnot the greenhouse-gas standards) to expire after \nmodel year 2025.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \n\u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2022).4 \n \n3 78 Fed. Reg. at 2114-2115; see Cal. Air Res. Bd., ACC II ZEV \nTechnology Assessment, at 11-12 tbl. 2 (Apr. 12, 2022) (showing \nelectric ranges of model year 2021 battery and plug-in hybrid ve-\nhicles), https://tinyurl.com/2d2db9vc (last visited Mar. 11, 2025).  \n4  California adopted that amendment because its Advanced \nClean Cars II standards included a new set of ZEV requirements \napplicable to model years 2026 and beyond.  See Cal. Code Regs. \ntit. 13, \u00a7 1962.4(a) (2022).  EPA granted a waiver for the Ad-\nvanced Clean Cars II standards on December 17, 2024.  90 Fed. \n(continued\u2026) \n\n \n7 \n \nCalifornia requested a waiver for the Advanced \nClean Cars I program in 2012.  That request described \nhow the new standards would increase production of \nzero-emission vehicles, thus decreasing emissions of \ncriteria pollutants and greenhouse gases.  J.A. 34-35, \n40-44.  EPA granted the waiver in early 2013.  78 Fed. \nReg. at 2145.  As the Federal Register notice of that \naction observed, petitions for judicial review were due \nby March 11, 2013.  Id.; see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1).  No-\nbody challenged EPA\u2019s decision to grant the waiver. \nMore than six years later, EPA withdrew the parts \nof the waiver at issue in this case.  84 Fed. Reg. 51,310 \n(Sept. 27, 2019).  By that time, automakers had made \n\u201cinvestments to meet\u201d the greenhouse-gas and ZEV \nstandards and \u201chad adjusted their fleets to comply \nwith\u201d them.  Pet. App. 12a; see id. at 124a.  Consumers \nhad grown increasingly familiar with zero-emission \nvehicles.  Even after the waiver was withdrawn, con-\nsumer demand for those vehicles continued to grow \nand automakers continued to announce plans to sell \nthem in greater numbers.  J.A. 191-192, 201-203.  By \n2020, for example, zero-emission vehicles were around \n8% of the new light-duty vehicles registered in Califor-\nnia; that figure jumped to over 12% the following \nyear.5 \nIn 2021, EPA solicited comment on whether it \nshould reinstate the waiver.  The state respondents \nsubmitted a comment in July 2021, explaining that \n \nReg. 642 (2025).  Several challenges to that waiver are now pend-\ning, including one that two of the petitioners here filed on Febru-\nary 28, 2025.  Pet. for Rev., Valero Renewable Fuels Co., LLC v. \nEPA, No. 25-1078 (D.C. Cir.).   \n5 Cal. Energy Comm\u2019n, New ZEV Sales in California, https://ti-\nnyurl.com/pt526fp5 (displaying \u201cZEV Sales Share\u201d in top-right \ncorner when 2020 and 2021 filters are selected). \n\n \n8 \n \nthe withdrawal was unlawful and poorly reasoned.  \nC.A. J.A. 188-215; see J.A. 51-68.  Auto-industry com-\nmenters emphasized the \u201cbillions of dollars of invest-\nment \nin \nelectric \nvehicle \nmanufacturing \nand \ninfrastructure\u201d that automakers had already made as \na result of the 2013 decision to grant the waiver.  J.A. \n103 (National Coalition for Advanced Transportation \ncomment); cf. J.A. 63 (California comment observing \nthat \u201cautomakers have complied with, and often over-\ncomplied with, model years 2017-2020 already\u201d).  EPA \nreinstated the waiver in March 2022.  87 Fed. Reg. \n14,332 (Mar. 14, 2022). \nB. Procedural Background \n1.  The petitioners here are various companies that \nproduce or sell liquid fuels, as well as related trade as-\nsociations.  Pet. App. 2a.  They filed petitions for re-\nview of EPA\u2019s reinstatement decision in the D.C. \nCircuit on May 12, 2022.  Id. at 15a.  The court of ap-\npeals consolidated those cases, along with another \ncase initiated by a group of States led by Ohio.  Id.  \nShortly thereafter, the state respondents here filed an \nunopposed motion for leave to intervene in support of \nEPA, as did various automakers and public-interest \norganizations.  Id. at 15a & nn.4-6; see J.A. 107.  Those \nmotions were granted.  See Pet. App. 15a. \nPetitioners principally argued that EPA\u2019s rein-\nstatement of the waiver contravened the Clean Air \nAct.  Pet. App. 16a.  Before the court of appeals could \nreach the merits of that claim, however, it had to as-\nsure itself of jurisdiction.  Under longstanding circuit \nrules, the opening brief for a petitioner seeking review \nof agency action \u201cmust set forth the basis for the claim \nof standing.\u201d  D.C. Cir. R. 28(a)(7).  And if \u201cstanding is \nnot apparent from the administrative record, the brief \nmust include arguments and evidence establishing the \n\n \n9 \n \nclaim of standing.\u201d  Id.; see also Sierra Club v. EPA, \n292 F.3d 895, 901 (D.C. Cir. 2002). \nPetitioners\u2019 opening brief below devoted just two \nparagraphs to standing.  J.A. 118-119.  Petitioners ex-\nplained that \u201cdepressing the demand\u201d for liquid fuels \n\u201cinjures petitioners and petitioners\u2019 members finan-\ncially.\u201d  Id. at 118.

As their case progresses, they \nmust \u201cpoint to factual evidence\u201d establishing that they \nsatisfied the three elements of standing\u2014injury, cau-\nsation, and redressability\u2014as of the time they filed \nsuit.  Murthy v. Missouri, 603 U.S. 43, 57-58 (2024).  \nThe only question here is how to apply those long-set-\ntled requirements to the peculiar circumstances of this \ncase, involving a waiver of preemption under Section \n209(b) of the Clean Air Act. \nAs petitioners describe things, that question is \n\u201cstraightforward\u201d because standing is automatic here.  \nPet. Br. 35.  Petitioners profit from sales of fuel.  They \nnote that the waiver allowed California to impose \nstate standards limiting greenhouse-gas emissions \nacross automakers\u2019 fleets and requiring automakers to \nsell a certain percentage of zero-emission vehicles.  Pe-\ntitioners assert that \u201c[t]hey promptly challenged \nEPA\u2019s waiver,\u201d id. at 20; that the waiver injures peti-\ntioners and their members by \u201creduc[ing] the use of \nliquid fuel,\u201d id.; and that \u201c[s]etting aside EPA\u2019s waiver \nwould . . . end[] the artificial depression of demand for \npetitioners\u2019 products,\u201d id. at 20-21.  Standing was so \n\u201cobvious,\u201d in their view, that they did not \u201cneed to sup-\nply additional record evidence\u201d to establish redressa-\nbility.  Id. at 17, 18. \nBut \u201capplying the law of standing\u201d frequently de-\nmands a \u201cheavily fact-dependent\u201d inquiry, FDA v. All. \nfor Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 384 (2024), and pe-\ntitioners elide the most salient facts in this case.  EPA \ngranted the relevant waiver in 2013.  Petitioners did \nnot challenge that waiver and neither did anyone else.  \nIt remained in effect for more than six years before \n\n \n2 \n \nEPA withdrew it in 2019.  During those six years, in \nresponse to the state standards and wider national \nand global trends, automakers invested heavily in \nchanging their fleets and building consumer demand \nfor electric vehicles.  Consumer preferences and the \nautomobile market evolved.  Even when EPA with-\ndrew the waiver, automakers accelerated their transi-\ntion to electric vehicles and consumer demand \ncontinued to grow. \nIn 2021, when EPA invited comment on whether to \nreinstate the waiver, the state respondents supported \nreinstatement.  As their comment explained, the with-\ndrawal had exceeded EPA\u2019s authority and it deprived \nCalifornia\u2019s regulations of legal effect.  But by the time \nEPA reinstated the waiver and petitioners challenged \nthat decision in 2022, \u201c\u2018both internal sustainability \ngoals and external market forces\u2019\u201d were pushing \n\u201cmanufacturers to transition toward electric vehicles, \nirrespective of California\u2019s regulations.\u201d  Pet. App. 24a \nn.8.  Indeed, publicly available evidence submitted by \nthe state respondents showed that zero-emission vehi-\ncles sold in California in 2022 already exceeded what \nthe relevant standards required.  Consumers were \nwilling to pay substantial price premiums for those ve-\nhicles.  And automakers had strong incentives to keep \nselling them. \nWhen the court of appeals confronted petitioners\u2019 \nchallenge to the reinstatement, it had to assure itself \nof jurisdiction by evaluating whether vacatur of that \nreinstatement would likely lead automakers to make \nchoices that would redress petitioners\u2019 asserted injury.  \nGiven the circumstances when petitioners filed suit in \nMay 2022, would automakers change their fleets or \nprices in a way that would increase demand for peti-\ntioners\u2019 liquid-fuel products?  Or would automakers \n\n \n3 \n \nexceed the requirements of California\u2019s standards for \ntheir own economic and strategic reasons, even with-\nout a legal requirement to do so?  Petitioners submit-\nted no evidence addressing that critical issue.  And \ngiven that absence of proof, the court of appeals \nproperly held that petitioners failed to meet their bur-\nden of demonstrating redressability. \nPetitioners ask this Court to excuse that failure.  \nThey first urge the Court to adopt a new \u201ccategorical \nrule.\u201d  Pet. Br. 4.  Under that rule, redressability \nwould be established automatically whenever peti-\ntioners challenge a regulation that implicates the use \nof their products\u2014even if the regulation applies only \nto third parties, and even where petitioners introduce \nno evidence indicating that those third parties would \nhave acted differently in the regulation\u2019s absence.  Id.  \nIn the alternative, petitioners ask the Court to credit \ntheir unsubstantiated predictions about how au-\ntomakers might respond to a vacatur.  Id. at 30-35.  \nThose arguments find no support in this Court\u2019s prec-\nedent.  Adopting them would effectively eliminate the \nplaintiff\u2019s \u201cburden of showing that third parties will \nlikely react\u201d to a favorable judgment in a way that pro-\nvides redress.  Dep\u2019t of Com. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, \n768 (2019).  And they would allow a court to assume \nredressability even if all the evidence before it indi-\ncates that a favorable judgment would not, in fact, re-\ndress the plaintiffs\u2019 injury.  This Court should reject \npetitioners\u2019 novel standing theories and affirm the \njudgment below. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal and Regulatory Background \n1.  The Clean Air Act directs EPA to prescribe fed-\neral standards governing emissions of air pollutants \n\n \n4 \n \nfrom new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle en-\ngines.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7521.  Section 209(a) of the Act gen-\nerally preempts States and their political subdivisions \nfrom \u201cadopt[ing] or attempt[ing] to enforce any stand-\nard relating to the control of emissions from new mo-\ntor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines.\u201d  Id. \n\u00a7 7543(a).  But Section 209(b) instructs EPA to \u201cwaive \napplication of [Section 209] to any State which ha[d] \nadopted\u201d qualifying emission standards \u201cprior to \nMarch 30, 1966, if the State determines that the State \nstandards will be, in the aggregate, at least as protec-\ntive of public health and welfare as applicable Federal \nstandards.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7543(b)(1).  If a State makes that de-\ntermination, EPA must waive preemption unless it \nmakes one of three enumerated findings.  See id. \n\u00a7 7543(b)(1)(A)-(C). \nCalifornia is the only State eligible for a waiver un-\nder Section 209(b) because it was the only State that \nhad developed qualifying motor vehicle emissions \nstandards before March 30, 1966.  Pet. App. 7a.  \u201cCon-\ngress recognized that California was already the \n\u2018lead[er] in the establishment of standards for regula-\ntion of automative pollutant emissions\u2019 at a time when \nthe federal government had yet to promulgate any reg-\nulations of its own.\u201d  Engine Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 88 \nF.3d 1075, 1079 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  Congress designed \nSection 209 to allow California to continue to serve as \na \u201c\u2018laboratory for innovation,\u2019\u201d id. at 1080, while also \n\u201cavoid[ing] the economic disruption\u201d that would come \nfrom manufacturers \u201chaving to meet fifty-one separate \nsets of emission control requirements,\u201d Motor & \nEquip. Mfrs. Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. EPA, 627 F.2d 1095, 1109 \n(D.C. Cir. 1979); see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7507 (1977 \namendment allowing other States to adopt standards \n\u201cidentical to the California standards for which a \nwaiver has been granted for such model year\u201d); Pet. \n\n \n5 \n \nApp. 9a n.3 (noting that \u201cseventeen states have chosen \nto adopt some portion of the California regulations\u201d). \nCalifornia received its first waiver in 1968 and has \nreceived additional waivers in every subsequent dec-\nade.1  For instance, EPA granted a waiver in 1993 for \nCalifornia\u2019s first Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) regula-\ntion, which required a specific percentage of light-duty \nvehicles to be zero-emission vehicles with no exhaust \nor evaporative emissions.  58 Fed. Reg. 4166 (Jan. 13, \n1993).2  EPA granted another waiver, in 2009, for Cal-\nifornia\u2019s first set of regulations to control greenhouse-\ngas emissions from motor vehicles.  74 Fed. Reg. \n32,744 (July 8, 2009). \n2.  This litigation concerns a set of emissions \nstandards that California adopted in 2012 as part of \nits Advanced Clean Cars I program.  78 Fed. Reg. 2112 \n(Jan. 9, 2013).  As relevant here, those standards in-\ncluded a requirement that automakers reduce the av-\nerage greenhouse-gas emissions across the fleets of \nvehicles they sell in California.  See id. at 2114.  They \nalso included new ZEV standards, requiring manufac-\nturers to meet specified \u201cZEV credit percentage\u201d re-\nquirements.  Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(b) \n(2012).   \nA manufacturer can satisfy the \u201cZEV credit per-\ncentage\u201d in several ways:  by generating credits from \nsales of qualifying vehicles, purchasing credits from \nother manufacturers, using excess credits banked in \nprior years, or applying credits obtained by overcom-\n \n1 See EPA, Vehicle Emissions California Waivers and Authoriza-\ntions, https://tinyurl.com/3rxscztw (last visited Mar. 6, 2025). \n2  See Cal.

Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(d)(5); 78 \nFed. Reg. at 2119-2120, 2135.  The number of ZEV \ncredits generated by a vehicle sale depends on the ve-\nhicle\u2019s range when operating on electric power.  See \nCal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(d)(5).  For example, a \nplug-in hybrid vehicle with a \u201c50 mile\u201d electric range \nearns one credit, while a fully battery-electric vehicle \nwith a \u201c350 mile\u201d range earns four credits.3  As a re-\nsult, a fleet may satisfy the standards even though \nZEV sales as a percentage of light-duty vehicles sold \nis well below the applicable ZEV credit percentage re-\nquirement.  \nThe Advanced Clean Cars I standards affected \nmodel years beginning in 2017 (for greenhouse-gas \nemissions) and 2018 (for ZEV requirements).  Both \nsets of standards were originally structured to in-\ncrease in stringency through model year 2025 and re-\nmain in effect at 2025 levels for subsequent model \nyears.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1961.3(a)(1)(A) \n(2012); id. \u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2012); J.A. 50.  In 2022, \nhowever, California amended the ZEV standards (but \nnot the greenhouse-gas standards) to expire after \nmodel year 2025.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \n\u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2022).4 \n \n3 78 Fed. Reg. at 2114-2115; see Cal. Air Res. Bd., ACC II ZEV \nTechnology Assessment, at 11-12 tbl. 2 (Apr. 12, 2022) (showing \nelectric ranges of model year 2021 battery and plug-in hybrid ve-\nhicles), https://tinyurl.com/2d2db9vc (last visited Mar. 11, 2025).  \n4  California adopted that amendment because its Advanced \nClean Cars II standards included a new set of ZEV requirements \napplicable to model years 2026 and beyond.  See Cal. Code Regs. \ntit. 13, \u00a7 1962.4(a) (2022).  EPA granted a waiver for the Ad-\nvanced Clean Cars II standards on December 17, 2024.  90 Fed. \n(continued\u2026) \n\n \n7 \n \nCalifornia requested a waiver for the Advanced \nClean Cars I program in 2012.  That request described \nhow the new standards would increase production of \nzero-emission vehicles, thus decreasing emissions of \ncriteria pollutants and greenhouse gases.  J.A. 34-35, \n40-44.  EPA granted the waiver in early 2013.  78 Fed. \nReg. at 2145.  As the Federal Register notice of that \naction observed, petitions for judicial review were due \nby March 11, 2013.  Id.; see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1).  No-\nbody challenged EPA\u2019s decision to grant the waiver. \nMore than six years later, EPA withdrew the parts \nof the waiver at issue in this case.  84 Fed. Reg. 51,310 \n(Sept. 27, 2019).  By that time, automakers had made \n\u201cinvestments to meet\u201d the greenhouse-gas and ZEV \nstandards and \u201chad adjusted their fleets to comply \nwith\u201d them.  Pet. App. 12a; see id. at 124a.  Consumers \nhad grown increasingly familiar with zero-emission \nvehicles.  Even after the waiver was withdrawn, con-\nsumer demand for those vehicles continued to grow \nand automakers continued to announce plans to sell \nthem in greater numbers.  J.A. 191-192, 201-203.  By \n2020, for example, zero-emission vehicles were around \n8% of the new light-duty vehicles registered in Califor-\nnia; that figure jumped to over 12% the following \nyear.5 \nIn 2021, EPA solicited comment on whether it \nshould reinstate the waiver.  The state respondents \nsubmitted a comment in July 2021, explaining that \n \nReg. 642 (2025).  Several challenges to that waiver are now pend-\ning, including one that two of the petitioners here filed on Febru-\nary 28, 2025.  Pet. for Rev., Valero Renewable Fuels Co., LLC v. \nEPA, No. 25-1078 (D.C. Cir.).   \n5 Cal. Energy Comm\u2019n, New ZEV Sales in California, https://ti-\nnyurl.com/pt526fp5 (displaying \u201cZEV Sales Share\u201d in top-right \ncorner when 2020 and 2021 filters are selected). \n\n \n8 \n \nthe withdrawal was unlawful and poorly reasoned.  \nC.A. J.A. 188-215; see J.A. 51-68.  Auto-industry com-\nmenters emphasized the \u201cbillions of dollars of invest-\nment \nin \nelectric \nvehicle \nmanufacturing \nand \ninfrastructure\u201d that automakers had already made as \na result of the 2013 decision to grant the waiver.  J.A. \n103 (National Coalition for Advanced Transportation \ncomment); cf. J.A. 63 (California comment observing \nthat \u201cautomakers have complied with, and often over-\ncomplied with, model years 2017-2020 already\u201d).  EPA \nreinstated the waiver in March 2022.  87 Fed. Reg. \n14,332 (Mar. 14, 2022). \nB. Procedural Background \n1.  The petitioners here are various companies that \nproduce or sell liquid fuels, as well as related trade as-\nsociations.  Pet. App. 2a.  They filed petitions for re-\nview of EPA\u2019s reinstatement decision in the D.C. \nCircuit on May 12, 2022.  Id. at 15a.  The court of ap-\npeals consolidated those cases, along with another \ncase initiated by a group of States led by Ohio.  Id.  \nShortly thereafter, the state respondents here filed an \nunopposed motion for leave to intervene in support of \nEPA, as did various automakers and public-interest \norganizations.  Id. at 15a & nn.4-6; see J.A. 107.  Those \nmotions were granted.  See Pet. App. 15a. \nPetitioners principally argued that EPA\u2019s rein-\nstatement of the waiver contravened the Clean Air \nAct.  Pet. App. 16a.  Before the court of appeals could \nreach the merits of that claim, however, it had to as-\nsure itself of jurisdiction.  Under longstanding circuit \nrules, the opening brief for a petitioner seeking review \nof agency action \u201cmust set forth the basis for the claim \nof standing.\u201d  D.C. Cir. R. 28(a)(7).  And if \u201cstanding is \nnot apparent from the administrative record, the brief \nmust include arguments and evidence establishing the \n\n \n9 \n \nclaim of standing.\u201d  Id.; see also Sierra Club v. EPA, \n292 F.3d 895, 901 (D.C. Cir. 2002). \nPetitioners\u2019 opening brief below devoted just two \nparagraphs to standing.  J.A. 118-119.  Petitioners ex-\nplained that \u201cdepressing the demand\u201d for liquid fuels \n\u201cinjures petitioners and petitioners\u2019 members finan-\ncially.\u201d  Id. at 118.  They cited documents from Cali-\nfornia\u2019s 2011 rulemaking in which a California agency \nhad forecast the prospect of financial injury to oil and \ngas industry participants.  Id. (citing C.A. J.A. 799, \n801, 830, 832).  Petitioners asserted that \u201c[t]his eco-\nnomic injury . . . is caused by the challenged regula-\ntory action, and this Court can redress that injury by \nsetting aside the action.\u201d  J.A. 118.  They attached 14 \ndeclarations, but the only discussion of redressability \nin those declarations consisted of unsupported asser-\ntions that vacatur would remedy petitioners\u2019 injury.  \nId. at 130, 137, 150, 154, 158, 167. \nIn response, the state respondents argued that pe-\ntitioners had failed to establish standing, emphasizing \nthat petitioners provided no evidence that vacatur of \nthe reinstatement decision in May 2022 would change \nautomakers\u2019 behavior in a way that would increase \nfuel sales.  J.A. 185-187.  The state respondents also \nsubmitted evidence undermining the likelihood of any \nsuch change:  by 2022, sales of zero-emission vehicles \nin California exceeded what was required by the rele-\nvant standards; consumer demand for those vehicles \nwas growing, as was consumer willingness to pay price \npremiums; and many manufacturers had announced \nplans for even greater zero-emission vehicle sales in \nthe future.  Id. at 191-195, 201-203.  On reply, peti-\ntioners did not submit record evidence countering the \nstate respondents\u2019 evidence about the circumstances \nin 2022.  See id. at 209-211. \n\n \n10 \n \nAt oral argument, the panel questioned petitioners \nabout jurisdiction, with a particular focus on the \u201car-\ngument that you haven\u2019t demonstrated redressabil-\nity.\u201d  C.A. Oral Arg. 25:50-26:12.  Two weeks later, \npetitioners sought leave to file a supplemental brief \nand to supplement the record with two new declara-\ntions.  Pet. App. 30a.  The proposed brief and declara-\ntions mostly addressed the separate issue of mootness.  \nSee C.A. Private Pet. Proposed Supp. Br. 1-3, 4-13.  In \na short section on standing, petitioners characterized \nthe arguments against redressability as \u201cimplausible\u201d \nand \u201cincredible,\u201d id. at 3, 4\u2014but again cited no evi-\ndence establishing how judicial relief in May 2022 \nwould have redressed their asserted injuries, and did \nnot attempt to counter the state respondents\u2019 evidence \non that point.   \n2.  The court of appeals concluded that it lacked ju-\nrisdiction to decide petitioners\u2019 challenge because pe-\ntitioners had failed to establish Article III standing.  \nPet. App. 16a-19a.  Without deciding whether petition-\ners had established injury or causation, the court ex-\nplained that petitioners fell \u201cfar short of meeting their \nburden\u201d to establish a likelihood \u201cthat their alleged \ninjuries would be redressed\u201d if the court agreed with \npetitioners\u2019 merits theory and vacated EPA\u2019s rein-\nstatement decision.  Id. at 21a. \nAs the court explained, redressability for petition-\ners \u201c\u2018hinge[d] on\u2019 the actions of third parties\u2014the au-\ntomobile manufacturers who are subject to the \nwaiver.\u201d  Pet. App. 22a.  Petitioners needed to show \nthat automakers would respond to vacatur of the rein-\nstatement \u201cby producing and selling fewer non-con-\nventional vehicles or by altering the prices of their \nvehicles such that fewer non-conventional vehicles\u2014\nand more conventional vehicles\u2014were sold.\u201d  Id.  But \n\n \n11 \n \nthe record indicated \u201cthat \u2018manufacturers are already \nselling more qualifying vehicles in California than the \nState\u2019s standards require,\u2019\u201d id. at 28a, and \u201cthat \u2018both \ninternal sustainability goals and external market \nforces\u2019 are prompting manufacturers to transition to-\nward electric vehicles, irrespective of California\u2019s reg-\nulations,\u201d id. at 24a n.8; see also id. at 28a. \nNevertheless, the court of appeals observed, peti-\ntioners \u201ctreated redressability as a foregone conclu-\nsion\u201d instead of making a factual showing.  Pet. App. \n25a.  They did not \u201cattempt[] to explain in any detail \nhow their injuries are redressable, let alone to \u2018cit[e] \nany record evidence\u2019 or to file \u2018additional affidavits or \nother evidence sufficient to support\u2019 redressability.\u201d  \nId. at 24a-25a.  Nor did petitioners \u201cmeaningfully ad-\ndress[]\u201d redressability on reply, after the state re-\nspondents \nintroduced \narguments \nand \nevidence \ncontesting redressability.  Id. at 28a.  \u201cUltimately, the \nrecord evidence, coupled with the filings of the EPA \nand intervenors, provide[d] th[e] Court with no basis \nto conclude that Petitioners\u2019 claims are redressable\u2014\na necessary element of standing that Petitioners bear \nthe burden of establishing.\u201d  Id. at 29a. \nThe court of appeals also described its understand-\ning that the challenge before it \u201cconcern[ed] only\u201d the \nreinstatement of the waiver \u201cas to Model Years 2017 \nthrough 2025.\u201d  Pet. App. 22a.  But see supra p. 6; infra \np. 44.  On that understanding, the court explained, pe-\ntitioners had to show \u201cnot only that automobile man-\nufacturers are likely to respond to a decision by this \nCourt by changing their fleets in a way that alleviates \n[petitioners\u2019] injuries in some way, but also that auto-\nmobile manufacturers would do so relatively quickly\u2014\nby Model Year 2025.\u201d  Pet. App. 23a.  That timing ele-\n\n \n12 \n \nment \u201cfurther complicated\u201d the redressability analy-\nsis,\u201d in the court\u2019s view.  Id. at 22a.  \u201c[E]ven if\u201d peti-\ntioners \nhad \nestablished \nthat \n\u201cautomobile \nmanufacturers were inclined to change course\u201d in re-\nsponse to a vacatur in a way that would increase fuel \nsales, it was \u201cfar from clear that they could do so\u201d by \nmodel year 2025.  Id. at 24a; see id. at 23a. \nFinally, the court of appeals denied petitioners\u2019 \npost-argument motion for leave to file a supplemental \nbrief and declarations.  Pet. App. 30a-32a.  The court \nexplained that, under the circumstances, petitioners \nshould have understood their obligation to address re-\ndressability in their opening brief.  Id. at 31a.  Moreo-\nver, \u201c[p]etitioners offer[ed] no explanation for having \nfailed to address redressability in their reply brief af-\nter California raised the issue in its opposition brief.\u201d  \nId. at 32a. \nPetitioners did not seek panel rehearing or rehear-\ning en banc.  They instead filed a petition for a writ of \ncertiorari respecting both the redressability question \nand the merits of their statutory claim (which the \ncourt of appeals had not reached).  This Court granted \ncertiorari on the redressability question only.6 \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nPetitioners sought a judgment vacating EPA\u2019s re-\ninstatement of a nearly decade-old waiver.  Under set-\ntled precedent, petitioners had the burden of \nestablishing that automakers would likely respond to \n \n6 This Court also denied a petition for certiorari filed by Ohio and \nother petitioners, which advanced a separate constitutional \nclaim.  See Ohio v. EPA, No. 24-13 (Dec. 16, 2024).  The court of \nappeals had held that the Ohio petitioners established standing \nto bring that claim, but it rejected the claim on the merits.  See \nPet. App. 32a-49a. \n\n \n13 \n \nthat vacatur in ways that would increase demand for \npetitioners\u2019 liquid-fuel products.  By the time they \nfiled suit in May 2022, however, the likely effect of a \nvacatur was not self-evident:  in the nine years since \nEPA first granted the waiver, automakers had made \nenormous investments in producing and marketing \nzero-emission vehicles; consumer demand for those ve-\nhicles had recently surged; and evidence before the \nCourt indicated that automakers would continue to \nsell those vehicles in large numbers regardless of the \nreinstatement or its potential vacatur.  Article III re-\nquired petitioners to introduce current evidence but-\ntressing their assertion that a vacatur in 2022 would \nlead automakers to change their fleets or prices in \nways that would increase liquid-fuel sales.  Because \npetitioners did not even attempt to do so, the court of \nappeals properly held that they failed to establish \nstanding. \nIn this Court, petitioners advance several novel \ntheories for why they had no obligation to introduce \nany evidence of redressability.  None of those theories \nis persuasive.  They first propose a categorical rule \nthat redressability is automatically established when-\never a challenged government action implicates the \nuse of the challenger\u2019s products.  Pet. Br. 17-18.  Prec-\nedent forecloses that proposal:  this Court has consist-\nently focused on the particular facts of a case\u2014and \nrequired challengers to submit specific evidence sup-\nporting redressability before obtaining a final judg-\nment.  For similar reasons, plaintiffs may not rely on \nunsupported predictions about the effects of a judg-\nment on a third party\u2019s choices.  See id. at 18.  They \nmust instead meet \u201ctheir burden of showing that third \nparties will likely react in predictable ways\u201d by intro-\nducing actual evidence.  Dep\u2019t of Com. v. New York, \n588 U.S. 752, 768 (2019).  And the fact that a statute \n\n \n14 \n \nor regulation \u201cdoes not sunset\u201d (Pet. Br. 19) does not, \nby itself, establish standing to challenge it. \nFinally, petitioners\u2019 belated attempts to identify \nrecord evidence supporting redressability cannot \nchange the outcome here.  Their briefs and declara-\ntions below were conclusory on the subject of redress-\nability.  The additional evidence they describe in this \nCourt not only comes too late, it would have been in-\nsufficient even if they had presented it below:  it con-\nsists of outdated projections that cannot substitute for \nevidence about the market as it existed when petition-\ners filed this challenge in May 2022. \nARGUMENT \nI. PETITIONERS FAILED TO ESTABLISH REDRESSA-\nBILITY \nPetitioners had the burden to establish standing.  \nAs to redressability, they had to show that judicial va-\ncatur of the reinstatement decision at the time they \nfiled suit in May 2022 would likely lead to increased \nfuel sales.  They failed to carry that burden.   \nA. It Was Petitioners\u2019 Burden to Introduce \nEvidence Establishing Each Element of \nArticle III Standing \nBefore turning to the merits of a suit, a court must \nassure itself of jurisdiction.  Summers v. Earth Island \nInst., 555 U.S. 488, 499 (2009).  The \u201cburden of estab-\nlishing\u201d jurisdiction lies with \u201cthe party asserting ju-\nrisdiction.\u201d  Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., \n511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994) (citing McNutt v. Gen. Motors \nAcceptance Corp. of Ind., 298 U.S. 178, 182-183 \n(1936)). \nStanding is \u201can essential and unchanging part\u201d of \nArticle III jurisdiction.  Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 \n\n \n15 \n \nU.S. 555, 560 (1992).  The doctrine of standing is built \non \u201cthe idea of separation of powers.\u201d  United States v. \nTexas, 599 U.S. 670, 675 (2023).  It \u201cimplements \u2018the \nFramers\u2019 concept of the proper\u2014and properly lim-\nited\u2014role of the courts in a democratic society.\u2019\u201d  FDA \nv. All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 380 (2024) \n(quoting Roberts, Article III Limits on Statutory \nStanding, 42 Duke L.J. 1219, 1220 (1993)). \nThe \u201cirreducible constitutional minimum of stand-\ning contains three elements.\u201d  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560.  \nFirst, the party bringing suit \u201cmust have suffered an \n\u2018injury in fact.\u2019\u201d  Id.  Second, that injury must \u201cbe \n\u2018fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defend-\nant, and not the result of the independent action of \nsome third party not before the court.\u2019\u201d  Id. (altera-\ntions omitted).  And third, \u201cit must be \u2018likely,\u2019 as op-\nposed to merely \u2018speculative,\u2019 that the injury will be \n\u2018redressed by a favorable decision.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 561.  Each \nelement is assessed as of the time the suit commenced.  \nMurthy v. Missouri, 603 U.S. 43, 58 (2024). \nA party seeking to invoke the jurisdiction of a fed-\neral court \u201cmust support each element of standing \n\u2018with the manner and degree of evidence required at \nthe successive stages of the litigation.\u2019\u201d  Murthy, 603 \nU.S. at 58.  At the outset of litigation, \u201c\u2018mere allega-\ntions\u2019\u201d may suffice; as the case progresses, a party \n\u201cmust . . . point to factual evidence.\u201d  Id.  A petitioner \nwho challenges agency action may be able to carry its \nburden by identifying evidence in the administrative \nrecord that establishes its standing.  See, e.g., Sierra \nClub v. EPA, 292 F.3d 895, 899-900 (D.C. Cir. 2002).  \nBut if \u201cstanding is not apparent from the administra-\ntive record,\u201d a petitioner\u2019s \u201cbrief must include argu-\nments and evidence establishing the claim of \nstanding.\u201d  D.C. Cir. R. 28(a)(7); see Sierra Club, 292 \n\n \n16 \n \nF.3d at 900; see generally 15 Redish, Moore\u2019s Federal \nPractice \u00a7\u00a7 101.31, 101.61[10] (3d ed. & Supp. 2025). \nSometimes standing analysis is straightforward.  \nFor instance, in some cases the party invoking the \ncourt\u2019s jurisdiction is itself \u201can object of\u201d the chal-\nlenged government action.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.  \nThe government might, for example, proscribe speech \nthat the plaintiff engages in.  See, e.g., Susan B. An-\nthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 161-167 (2014).  \nOr it might require a state plaintiff to engage in par-\nticular regulation.  See, e.g., West Virginia v. EPA, 597 \nU.S. 697, 718-719 (2022).  In those scenarios, \u201cthere is \nordinarily little question that the action . . . has \ncaused [the plaintiff] injury, and that a judgment pre-\nventing . . . the action will redress\u201d that injury.  Lujan, \n504 U.S. at 561-562; see All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 \nU.S. at 382. \nIn other scenarios, \u201cmuch more is needed.\u201d  Lujan, \n504 U.S. at 562.  When a party\u2019s \u201casserted injury \narises from the government\u2019s allegedly unlawful regu-\nlation . . . of someone else,\u201d for example, standing can \nbe \u201c\u2018substantially more difficult\u2019 to establish.\u201d  Id.  In \nthose cases, \u201ccausation and redressability ordinarily \nhinge on the response of\u201d that third party\u2014\u201cand per-\nhaps on the response of others as well.\u201d  Id.  Because \nthe inquiry turns on \u201cchoices made by independent ac-\ntors not before the courts,\u201d the plaintiff must \u201cadduce \nfacts showing that those choices have been or will be \nmade in such manner as to produce causation and per-\nmit redressability of injury.\u201d  Id.  For instance, if plain-\ntiffs are injured by the lack of affordable private \nhousing, they must show \u201can actionable causal rela-\ntionship\u201d between the challenged zoning ordinance \nand the choices of private third parties who build and \nsell housing.  Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 507 \n\n \n17 \n \n(1975).  Their claim may not proceed if the asserted \ninjury instead results from \u201cthe economics of the area \nhousing market.\u201d  Id. at 506; see generally id. at 508 \n(requiring the party \u201cwho seeks to challenge\u201d a gov-\nernment action to introduce \u201cspecific, concrete facts \ndemonstrating . . . that he personally would benefit in \na tangible way from the court\u2019s intervention\u201d). \nConcrete evidence from the plaintiff is especially \ncritical if another party has introduced evidence un-\ndermining the asserted theory of standing.  \u201cWhen \nchallenged by . . . an opposing party,\u201d for example, a \nplaintiff \u201cinvoking the court\u2019s jurisdiction cannot \nsimply allege a nonobvious harm, without more.\u201d  \nWittman v. Personhuballah, 578 U.S. 539, 545 (2016).  \nAnd if \u201cthere is no \u2018more,\u2019\u201d then there is no jurisdic-\ntion.  Id.; see generally Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U.S. \n77, 96-97 (2010) (when defendants raise facts calling \njurisdiction into doubt, plaintiffs \u201cmust support their \nallegations by competent proof\u201d). \nB. The Circumstances of This Case Raised a \nSerious Question as to Whether Petition-\ners\u2019 Claim Was Redressable \nAs the court of appeals recognized, this is not a case \nwhere standing is self-evident.  Petitioners comprise \ncompanies that produce or refine fuel, companies that \ndevelop biorefining technology, and various trade as-\nsociations (for energy companies, farmers, and con-\nvenience store owners).  Pet. Br. II-V, 20.  They claim \nan injury of financial harm from reduced fuel sales.  \nId. at 21-22.  But the standards at issue here do not \nregulate fuel production or sales.  Instead, the stand-\nards regulate an activity in which petitioners do not \nparticipate:  automobile sales.  Because petitioners are \nnot directly regulated by the challenged agency action, \n\n \n18 \n \nthey needed to identify evidence showing that au-\ntomakers who are subject to those standards would \nmake choices that would \u201cproduce causation and per-\nmit redressability of injury.\u201d  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 562. \nPetitioners\u2019 theory is that the state emissions \nstandards injure them by effectively requiring au-\ntomakers to sell more \u201cvehicles that use less or no liq-\nuid fuel,\u201d which reduces demand for petitioners\u2019 \nproducts.  Pet. Br. 17.  They posit that their revenues \nwould increase if the standards no longer had legal ef-\nfect, because automakers would then make and sell \nmore cars that run on liquid fuel.  Id. at 24.  That the-\nory would indeed have been \u201cstraightforward\u201d (id. at \n35) if petitioners had promptly sought review follow-\ning EPA\u2019s original approval of the waiver in 2013\u2014as \nthey recently did in challenging the Advanced Clean \nCars II waiver, see supra p. 6 n.4.7 \nIn calendar year 2013, zero-emission vehicles made \nup about 2% of light-duty vehicle sales in California.8  \nTo meet the \u201cminimum ZEV credit percentage\u201d re-\nquirements of the Advanced Clean Cars I standards, \n \n7 Petitioners have suggested that D.C. Circuit precedent prohib-\nited them from challenging the 2013 action because California \ndeemed compliance with federal standards to satisfy the state \nstandards.  See Pet. 8 (citing Chamber of Com. of U.S. v. EPA, \n642 F.3d 192, 206 (D.C. Cir. 2011)); Pet. Br. 8-9.  But California\u2019s \nZEV standards\u2014the main focus of petitioners\u2019 present chal-\nlenge\u2014never contained a \u201cdeemed-to-comply\u201d provision, and \nthus could have been challenged in 2013.  J.A. 59-60 n.14 \n(deemed-to-comply provision \u201conly applies to the [greenhouse-\ngas] standard\u201d). \n8 See Cal. Air Res.

Cal. Code \nRegs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2012).  Regulators es-\ntimated that meeting that 22% credit requirement \nwould require zero-emission vehicles to comprise \nabout 15% of light-duty new-vehicle sales by 2025.  See \nJ.A. 16, 32; 78 Fed. Reg. 2112, 2119 (Jan. 9, 2013).  Ab-\nsent the new regulatory requirement, there was no \nreason to think automakers would make that shift for \ntheir own independent reasons.  Consumers in 2013 \nwere largely unfamiliar with zero-emission vehicles or \nhad a negative impression of them.9  And automakers \nwarned that \u201cconsumer demand for ZEVs\u201d was so ane-\nmic that they might not even be able to meet the re-\nquirements for model year 2018.  78 Fed.

Br. 18, 34, 35) in \nMay 2022 that reduced sales of petitioners\u2019 fuel prod-\nucts were caused by the reinstatement of the waiver\u2014\ninstead of market forces and automakers\u2019 prior invest-\nments and plans.  Nor was it obvious that vacatur of \nthe reinstatement would likely affect automakers\u2019 fu-\nture behavior in a way that would redress the asserted \ninjury. \nIndeed, evidence submitted by the state respond-\nents indicated the opposite.  Publicly accessible sales \ndata showed that \u201czero-emission vehicles sold in cal-\nendar year 2022\u201d in California \u201cexceed what [the] \nstandards require.\u201d  J.A. 192.  For that calendar year, \nabout 19% of light-duty vehicles sold in the State qual-\nified as zero-emission vehicles under California\u2019s \nstandards\u2014exceeding the 15% that regulators had \nforecast would be needed for compliance.  Id. at 191-\n192; see supra p. 19.  The lion\u2019s share of those sales \n(16% of total light-duty sales) were battery-electric ve-\nhicles.13   \nThat represented a surge in sales of battery-elec-\ntric vehicles that far outpaced early forecasts.  The \nforecasts had projected that automakers would need \nbattery-electric vehicles to be just 3.7% of total light-\nduty sales by model year 2025 to meet the credit re-\nquirements of the ZEV standards.  J.A. 9.  The unex-\npected consumer shift to battery-electric vehicles \n(rather than plug-in hybrids, as forecasters originally \n \n13\n New \nZEV \nSales \nin \nCalifornia, \nsupra, \nhttps://ti-\nnyurl.com/pt526fp5 (displaying 262,076 \u201cBEV\u201d out of 1,581,844 \nannual light-duty sales when 2022 filter is selected). \n\n \n22 \n \nanticipated) had profound consequences for automak-\ners\u2019 compliance with the Advanced Clean Cars I stand-\nards.  Because battery-electric vehicles can travel \nlonger distances without emitting tailpipe pollutants, \nthey yield the most \u201cZEV credits\u201d for purposes of the \nstandards.  See supra p. 6.  So the fact that 16% of \nlight-duty sales were battery-electric vehicles in 2022 \nyielded a ZEV credit percentage for that year that was \nfar above the highest requirement that the standards \nwould ever impose.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \n\u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2012) (22% ZEV credit requirement \nstarting in model year 2025).  And sales in California \nin 2022 were also exceeding the most stringent re-\nquirements of the fleetwide greenhouse-gas stand-\nards, even for future years, because the battery-\nelectric vehicles also have far lower emissions than \nplug-in hybrids.  See J.A. 7. \nBy May 2022, nine years after EPA first granted a \nwaiver for the Advanced Clean Cars I standards, there \nwas substantial reason to believe that automakers \nwould exceed the standards for their own reasons even \nwithout the reinstatement.  The court of appeals could \nnot \u201cpresume[]\u201d that petitioners\u2019 challenge was re-\ndressable.  Kokkonen, 511 U.S. at 377.  Nor could it \nassume redressability based on petitioners\u2019 \u201cuna-\ndorned speculation.\u201d  Simon v. E. Ky. Welfare Rts. \nOrg., 426 U.S. 26, 44 (1976).  Article III required the \ncourt to ask whether petitioners had \u201cmet their bur-\nden\u201d by introducing evidence demonstrating that au-\ntomakers would \u201clikely react\u201d to a vacatur of the 2022 \nreinstatement in ways that would increase demand for \npetitioners\u2019 products and services.  Dep\u2019t of Com. v. \nNew York, 588 U.S. 752, 768 (2019).   \n\n \n23 \n \nC. Petitioners Did Not Introduce Evidence \nEstablishing Redressability \nPetitioners did not carry their evidentiary burden.  \nIndeed, they submitted virtually no argument or evi-\ndence bearing on the likely effect of a vacatur on the \nmarket as it existed in 2022.   \n1.  Petitioners\u2019 opening brief in the court of appeals \ndevoted one sentence to redressability.  They asserted \nthat their \u201cinjury is caused by the challenged regula-\ntory action, and this Court can redress that injury by \nsetting aside the action.\u201d  J.A. 118.  That single con-\nclusory statement was not supported by any citation \nto evidence in the administrative record or elsewhere.  \nPetitioners attached 14 standing declarations to their \nopening brief.  See J.A. 120-184.  But none of those \ndeclarations was sufficient to carry their burden. \nThe bulk of each declaration described the declar-\nant\u2019s asserted injuries, with details supporting the \n(undisputed) proposition that petitioners and their \nmembers profit from fuel sales.  The declarants had \nalmost nothing to say about the critical question going \nto causation and redressability, which \u201care often \u2018flip \nsides of the same coin.\u2019\u201d  All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 \nU.S. at 380.  That question was whether, in 2022, the \nreinstatement of the waiver or the vacatur of that re-\ninstatement would affect automakers\u2019 choices in a \nmanner leading to changes in fuel sales.   \nOf the declarants who addressed causation, some \nasserted their \u201cunderstand[ing] that California\u2019s \ngreenhouse-gas standards and zero-emission-vehicle \nmandate reduce the demand for fuel in California.\u201d  \nJ.A. 125, 140, 169, 183; see also J.A. 176.  Those asser-\ntions were not accompanied by supporting facts or any \ndiscussion of the circumstances in 2022.  Other declar-\nants invoked statements from California about how \n\n \n24 \n \nthe standards would reduce demand for liquid fuels.  \nId. at 129, 136-137, 148, 153, 157, 166, 173, 180.  Peti-\ntioners now describe those statements as \u201crecent[] \nproject[ions] that the waiver would \u2018reduce emissions \nthrough reductions in fuel production.\u2019\u201d  Pet. Br. 38 \n(citing J.A. 148, 180).  But the projections are not \u201cre-\ncent\u201d at all.  They are from California\u2019s \u201c2012 Waiver \nRequest\u201d\u2014and state rulemaking documents submit-\nted as part of that request\u2014prepared a decade before \nthe challenged reinstatement and petitioners\u2019 suit.  \nJ.A. 148, 180; see also id. at 180 (citing state estimates \nfrom 2011).  Those outdated sources did not establish \nthat any reduced fuel sales in 2022 were caused by the \nwaiver\u2019s reinstatement instead of the dramatic \nchanges in the market and consumer demand that \npredated the reinstatement.14  \nThe declarants who addressed redressability did so \nin a single boilerplate sentence asserting that petition-\ners\u2019 \u201cinjuries would be substantially ameliorated if \nEPA\u2019s decision were set aside.\u201d  J.A. 130, 137, 150, \n154, 158, 167, 181; see Pet. App. 21a-22a.  Again, not \none of the declarants addressed the state of the market \nin 2022, when petitioners filed their suit.  Nor did they \nsay a word about automakers\u2019 behavior at that time, \nor the economic and other considerations that would \nshape automakers\u2019 response to a judicial vacatur.  See \ngenerally Friends of the Earth, Inc. v.

App. 28a-29a.  Their primary contention \non reply was that the States\u2019 argument \u201cdefies com-\nmon sense.\u201d  J.A. 209.  They also quoted statements \nfrom the state respondents\u2019 July 2021 comment in sup-\nport of the reinstatement.  Id. at 210; see Pet. Br. 38 \n(citing J.A. 66).  Those statements explained why \nEPA\u2019s 2019 decision to revoke the waiver was unjusti-\nfied based on the record EPA had before it in that year, \nsee J.A. 66 (citing 84 Fed. Reg. 51,310, 51,337 (Sept. \n27, 2019)), and then described California\u2019s \u201cdemon-\nstration in its 2012 waiver request,\u201d J.A. 66.  Neither \nstatement could have taken account of the market \ndata showing that zero-emission vehicle sales tripled \nbetween 2020 and mid-2022.  See id. at 191. \nAnd petitioners\u2019 reply (J.A. 208-212) did not mean-\ningfully address that more recent data either\u2014or the \nevidence showing that market penetration of zero-\nemission vehicles in California in 2022 far exceeded \nany current or future requirement of the relevant \nstandards.  Nor did petitioners respond to the evidence \nindicating that automakers would \u201cha[ve] a similar in-\ncentive to engage in\u201d the promotion and sale of zero-\n\n \n26 \n \nemission vehicles even if the standards were not in ef-\nfect.

Because petition-\ners did not provide the court of appeals with any facts \nshowing a likelihood that vacating EPA\u2019s 2022 rein-\nstatement would redress their asserted injuries, the \ncourt properly held that it lacked jurisdiction to decide \nthe merits.

PETITIONERS IDENTIFY NO VALID BASIS FOR RE-\nVERSAL \nHaving failed \u201cto \u2018cit[e] any record evidence\u2019 or to \nfile \u2018additional affidavits or other evidence sufficient to \nsupport\u2019 redressability\u201d in the court below, Pet. App. \n24a-25a, petitioners now ask this Court to hold that \nthey did \u201cnot need to supply additional record evi-\ndence,\u201d Pet. Br. 17.  They advance three theories:  \n(i) that the Court should \u201cadopt [a] categorical rule\u201d \nthat this type of government action \u201calone suffices to \nestablish redressability,\u201d id. at 17, 18; (ii) that redress-\nability follows from the purported \u201cpredictable effects\u201d \nof the 2022 reinstatement on automakers, id. at 18; \nand (iii) that the duration of the challenged waiver, by \nitself, establishes redressability, see id. at 19, 45-47.  \nBut this Court\u2019s precedent forecloses those theories.  \nAnd petitioners\u2019 attempt to argue, in the alternative, \nthat the record contains \u201cplenty [of] evidence\u201d support-\ning redressability (id. at 37) ignores the gulf between \nthe referenced evidence and the question that mat-\ntered:  how automakers would likely have responded \nto a decision vacating the waiver in May 2022.   \n\n \n28 \n \nA. Government Regulations Implicating the \nUse of a Product Do Not Categorically Es-\ntablish Standing for Producers to Sue \nPetitioners first propose a categorical rule that re-\ndressability is automatically established in every chal-\nlenge seeking to \u201cremove a regulatory impediment to \nthe use of petitioners\u2019 products.\u201d  Pet. Br. 17.  They \nnever clarify the scope of the word \u201cimpediment.\u201d  But \nit appears that their rule would cover a flat prohibition \non the use of a product as well as any lesser restriction \nthat allegedly affects or implicates its use.  And the \nrule would apply even where (as here) the record con-\ntains evidence indicating that a favorable judgment \nwould not actually redress the asserted injury.  That \nnovel proposal finds no basis in this Court\u2019s precedent.  \nFor a court to conclude that it has jurisdiction, the \n\u201c\u2018specific facts\u2019\u201d matter\u2014as does the \u201cevidence\u201d sub-\nmitted by the parties.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561. \n1. Petitioners\u2019 proposed rule is at odds \nwith the precedent they invoke \nPetitioners point to Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154 \n(1997), as support for their proposed rule.  Pet. Br. 25-\n26.  That decision reiterated that an injury resulting \nfrom \u201cthe independent action of some third party not \nbefore the court\u201d is insufficient to establish Article III \nstanding.  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 169 (internal quotation \nmarks and emphasis omitted).  It also noted that the \nbar on standing for injuries caused by independent ac-\ntion does not \u201cexclude injury produced by determina-\ntive or coercive effect\u201d of a government action on the \nchoices of a third party.  Id.  Bennett thus confirms the \ncommon-sense proposition that a petitioner is not nec-\nessarily foreclosed from establishing redressability \njust because a third party is \u201cthe very last step in the \n\n \n29 \n \nchain of causation.\u201d  Id.; see also Lujan, 504 U.S. at \n562. \nBut Bennett hardly supports petitioners\u2019 sweeping \ntheory that redressability is automatically established \nwhenever a challenger simply asserts some \u201cregula-\ntory impediment\u201d (Pet. Br. 25) to the use of its product.  \nTo the contrary, the Court\u2019s decision underscores how \nmuch the particular facts of a case matter.  In Bennett, \nranchers and irrigation districts challenged a Fish and \nWildlife Service biological opinion that proposed min-\nimum water levels for a water project.  But a third \nparty (the Bureau of Reclamation) \u201cretain[ed] ulti-\nmate responsibility\u201d for deciding whether to adopt the \nproposal.  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 168.  With respect to \ncausation and redressability, the main question was \nwhether the Bureau would in fact feel constrained to \ndo what the Service suggested.   \nScrutinizing the facts before it, the Court deter-\nmined that\u2014\u201cin reality\u201d\u2014the biological opinion would \nhave a \u201cdeterminative or coercive effect\u201d on the Bu-\nreau\u2019s action.  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 169.  Although the \nopinion was theoretically advisory, the Service had \nacknowledged \u201cthe virtually determinative effect of its \nbiological opinions.\u201d  Id. at 170.  And the Solicitor Gen-\neral conceded that this particular opinion would have \n\u201ca powerful coercive effect\u201d on the Bureau.  Id. at 169.  \nBefore the opinion, the Bureau had operated the water \nproject \u201cin the same manner throughout the 20th cen-\ntury.\u201d  Id. at 170.  But the Bureau had notified the \nService that in the future it \u201cintended to act in accord-\nance with\u201d the recommendations in the Service\u2019s opin-\nion.16  Those facts showed that the opinion (not some \n \n16 Resp. Br., Bennett v. Spear, No. 95-813 (U.S.), 1996 WL 396714, \n(continued\u2026) \n\n \n30 \n \nother motivation) would cause the Bureau to alter its \nbehavior.  And they allowed the Court to hold that pe-\ntitioners\u2019 injury would \u201c\u2018likely\u2019 be redressed\u2014i.e., the \nBureau will not impose [the] water level restrictions\u2014\nif the Biological Opinion is set aside.\u201d  Bennett, 520 \nU.S. at 170-171.   \nThe other cases invoked by petitioners featured \nsimilar factual assessments.  In Pierce v. Society of the \nSisters of the Holy Names of Jesus & Mary, 268 U.S. \n510 (1925), the law prohibiting parents from sending \ntheir children to private schools had \u201ccaused the with-\ndrawal from [the plaintiff\u2019s] schools of children who \nwould otherwise continue.\u201d  Id. at 532 (emphasis \nadded).  In CBS, Inc. v. United States, 316 U.S. 407, \n414, 423 (1942), an affidavit from the plaintiff radio \nnetwork made clear that radio stations were in fact \n\u201ccancelling or threatening to cancel their contracts in \norder to conform to\u201d the challenged regulations.  And \nin Northeastern Florida Chapter of Associated General \nContractors v. City of Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656, 668 \n(1993), standing rested on petitioner\u2019s allegation that \nits members \u201cregularly bid on construction contracts\u201d \nand \u201cwould have bid on contracts\u201d unavailable to them \ndue to the challenged program \u201cwere they so able.\u201d  Be-\ncause those allegations \u201cha[d] not been challenged,\u201d \nthe Court \u201cassum[ed] that they [were] true.\u201d  Id. at \n668-669.17   \n \nat *27 n.14 (July 15, 1996); see also id. at *8; Bennett v. Plenert, \n1993 WL 669429, at *3 (D. Or. Nov. 18, 1993). \n17 Because of the nature of the equal protection right at issue in \nNortheastern Florida, the companies did not need to show that \nthird parties would have selected their bids\u2014just that the com-\npanies were unable to compete on an equal basis.  See, e.g., Gratz \nv. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 244, 262 (2003). \n\n \n31 \n \nNone of those cases supports a categorical rule ex-\ncusing anyone who sells a product from the obligation \nto establish redressability when challenging a regula-\ntion implicating the use of that product.  And the pos-\nture of cases like Bennett and CBS only underscores \nthe deficiency of petitioners\u2019 showing here.  The peti-\ntioners in those cases sought to survive a motion to \ndismiss, and therefore had the \u201crelatively modest\u201d \nburden of advancing \u201c\u2018general factual allegations\u2019\u201d on \nthe elements of standing.  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 168, \n171; see CBS, 316 U.S. at 414, 423; cf. Ne. Fla., 508 \nU.S. at 668-669.  Here, petitioners were seeking to ob-\ntain a final judgment.  So they needed to \u201c\u2018set forth\u2019 by \naffidavit or other evidence \u2018specific facts\u2019\u201d demonstrat-\ning that vacatur would likely redress their injury.  \nBennett, 520 U.S. at 168; see Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.  \nNo amount of after-the-fact theorizing can excuse \ntheir failure to do so.   \nFor similar reasons, Energy Future Coalition v. \nEPA, 793 F.3d 141 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (Kavanaugh, J.), \ndoes not establish standing here.  That case involved \nethanol producers who sought to challenge an EPA \nregulation prohibiting automakers from using fuel \ncontaining 30% ethanol when testing new vehicles.  Id. \nat 143-144.  The court of appeals observed that stand-\ning can be shown where judicial relief \u201cwould remove \na regulatory hurdle\u201d to the use of a petitioner\u2019s prod-\nuct.  Id. at 144; see Pet. Br. 4, 13, 28, 29, 36.  But that \nwas the starting point for the court\u2019s analysis\u2014not the \nfinish line.  Unlike the petitioners here, the challeng-\ners in Energy Future submitted a detailed standing \nanalysis, which included an economist\u2019s explanation of \nhow the regulated parties would react to the sought-\n\n \n32 \n \nafter change.18  The court was therefore able to focus \non actual record evidence establishing \u201csubstantial \nreason to think that at least some vehicle manufactur-\ners would use\u201d the fuel in testing if the challenged reg-\nulation were eliminated.  Energy Future, 793 F.3d at \n144; see also id. at 144 (describing comments from \nFord Motor Company).  And the court expressly dis-\ntinguished the case before it from a case (like this one) \nin which studies and other \u201cobjective evidence directly \nundermined petitioners\u2019 theory of standing.\u201d  Id. at \n145 n.2. \n2. Petitioners\u2019 rule would violate basic \nprinciples of Article III standing \nThat focus on the particular circumstances of the \ncase, and the allegations and evidence before the \ncourt, is compelled by core requirements of Article III. \na.  Federal courts may not exercise jurisdiction \nbased on assumptions or speculation.  See, e.g., Clap-\nper, 568 U.S. at 414; Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better \nEnv\u2019t, 523 U.S. 83, 94 (1998).  After the pleading stage, \nthey must assure themselves that standing exists by \nexamining \u201c\u2018specific facts\u2019\u201d and \u201cevidence\u201d introduced \nby the plaintiff.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561; see All. for \nHippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 384 (noting the \u201cheavily \nfact-dependent\u201d nature of the inquiry).  That obliga-\ntion takes on added significance when the circum-\nstances of a case (or evidence submitted by the \nopposing party) create serious doubts about one of the \nelements of standing.  See generally Hertz Corp., 559 \nU.S. at 96-97. \n \n18 See Pet. Br., Energy Future, No. 14-1123, 2014 WL 5035232, at \n*29-41 (D.C. Cir. Oct. 8, 2014). \n\n \n33 \n \nTo be sure, \u201cthe nature and extent of facts that \nmust be\u201d submitted by a party seeking to challenge \ngovernment action \u201cdepends considerably\u201d on the sur-\nrounding circumstances.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.  A \nplaintiff who is directly regulated by the challenged \naction, for example, may only need to submit evidence \nshowing that it is an object of that regulation, and that \nit would engage in activities proscribed by the regula-\ntion if it were allowed to do so.  Supra p. 16.  Similarly, \nif the action prohibits other companies from using the \nplaintiff\u2019s product, causation and redressability may \nfollow from basic evidence that the plaintiff sells the \nproduct and third-party companies would have used it \nabsent the regulation.  See, e.g., Energy Future, 793 \nF.3d at 144. \nBut observations about the ease of satisfying evi-\ndentiary requirements in certain types of cases do not \namount to a categorical legal rule that \u201csuffices to es-\ntablish redressability\u201d absent evidence.  Pet. Br. 17.  \nAs this Court has explained, presumptions run \nagainst jurisdiction\u2014not in favor of it.  See, e.g., Renne \nv. Geary, 501 U.S. 312, 316 (1991) (\u201cWe presume that \nfederal courts lack jurisdiction unless the contrary ap-\npears affirmatively from the record.\u201d (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted)); see also Kokkonen, 511 U.S. at \n377.   \nA court must therefore examine the facts and evi-\ndence to determine whether\u2014\u201cin reality\u201d\u2014a judgment \naddressing a challenged government action would \nlikely redress a plaintiff\u2019s asserted injury.  Bennett, \n520 U.S. at 169.  For example, if a regulation makes it \nunlawful \u201cfor soda manufacturers to use sugar,\u201d En-\nergy Future, 793 F.3d at 144, a plaintiff may establish \nstanding by pointing to the regulation and introducing \n\n \n34 \n \nevidence that it sells sugar and that some sodas con-\ntain sugar.  But not every case will be that \u201csimple\u201d \n(Pet. Br. 47).  If the regulation instead made it unlaw-\nful only for soda manufacturers to sell more than 80% \nof their beverages with sugar, and the administrative \nrecord established that sugar-free sodas already rep-\nresented 30% of the market before the regulation, that \nplaintiff would have to do more to establish redressa-\nbility. \nAs discussed above, petitioners\u2019 case does not re-\nsemble the \u201csimple\u201d scenarios, primarily because no \none challenged EPA\u2019s initial decision to grant a waiver \nin 2013.  In the ensuing decade, automakers made \nenormous investments in zero-emission vehicles and \nconsumer tastes evolved.  By May 2022, it was not at \nall clear that the presence or absence of the Advanced \nClean Cars I standards would have a determinative or \ncoercive effect on the mix of cars sold by automakers.  \nSee supra pp. 20-22.  Market forces and internal goals \nwere pushing automakers to continue their shift to-\nward electric vehicles, regardless of California\u2019s regu-\nlations.  Pet. App. 24a n.8.  Those circumstances \ndemanded actual evidence showing redressability\u2014\nnot unsupported assertions about \u201ccommon sense and \nbasic economics.\u201d  Pet. Br. 30. \nb.  Petitioners\u2019 contrary arguments demonstrate a \nmisunderstanding of this Court\u2019s precedent.  It is true \n(Pet. Br. 27) that redressability involves \u201cthe relation-\nship between \u2018the judicial relief requested\u2019 and the \u2018in-\njury\u2019 suffered.\u201d  California v. Texas, 593 U.S. 659, 671 \n(2021).  But the necessary relationship is lacking \nwhere the plaintiff fails to prove that \u201cdepress[ed] \nmarket demand\u201d for its product in fact \u201cflows from\u201d \n(Pet. Br. 27) the challenged regulation, and that vaca-\ntur would likely lead to increased demand. \n\n \n35 \n \nPetitioners also contend that, \u201c[a]s far as redressa-\nbility is concerned, . . . Article III\u2019s demands are the \nsame whether the plaintiff is directly or indirectly reg-\nulated.\u201d  Pet. Br. 27.  Justice Scalia long ago rejected \nthat notion in an opinion for the Court.  When a plain-\ntiff is not the direct object of the government action it \nchallenges, \u201cstanding is not precluded, but it is ordi-\nnarily \u2018substantially more difficult\u2019 to establish.\u201d  \nLujan, 504 U.S. at 562.  That is because the plaintiff \nmust \u201cadduce facts\u201d creating a likelihood that the \nthird parties who are directly regulated will make \n\u201cchoices . . . in such manner as to produce causation \nand permit redressability of injury.\u201d  Id.  Petitioners \ndid not do so here. \n3. Petitioners\u2019 policy arguments do not \njustify their rule \nPetitioners eventually resort to a series of \u201cpolicy\u201d \narguments.  Pet. Br. 41; see id. at 41-45.  They first \nargue that the decision below effectively \u201crequire[s] \nthe endorsement of a directly regulated third party be-\nfore an indirectly regulated party can sue.\u201d  Id. at 38.  \nThat would be a problem, they contend, because di-\nrectly regulated entities often will be unwilling or un-\nable to assist indirectly affected challengers.  See id. \nat 42.  But the court of appeals did not require peti-\ntioners to \u201cprovid[e] affidavits from automakers\u201d as a \ncondition of standing.  Id. at 38.  The court\u2019s opinion \nshowed a willingness to consider a variety of other ma-\nterials (if identified by the parties), including com-\nments in the administrative record and public \nstatements from industry participants.  See Pet. App. \n23a-24a, 28a.   \nAnd there are a range of evidentiary sources be-\nyond \u201caffidavits from automakers\u201d that bear on how \nautomakers would likely respond to a vacatur in 2022.  \n\n \n36 \n \nThe state respondents gathered facts relevant to \nstanding from public databases, news articles, securi-\nties and court filings, government reports, and corpo-\nrate announcements.  See, e.g., J.A. 190-206.  Just a \nfew days after the oral argument caused petitioners to \ntake the jurisdictional questions seriously, petitioners \nlocated retired auto executives to file supplemental \ndeclarations that purported to speak authoritatively \nabout automakers\u2019 capabilities and practices.  See J.A. \n213, 218.19  In similar contexts, other litigants have \nrelied on a variety of sources.  See, e.g., C.A. Ohio Br. \nAdd. 37-54 (economist\u2019s declaration); Duke Pwr. Co. v. \nCarolina Envt\u2019l Study Grp., Inc., 438 U.S. 59, 75-76 \n(1978) (congressional testimony); Competitive Enter. \nInst. v. FCC, 970 F.3d 372, 383 (D.C. Cir. 2020) (ex-\npert\u2019s analysis); Competitive Enter. Inst. v. NHTSA, \n901 F.2d 107, 117 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (testimony from ad-\nministrative hearing).   \nThe decision below thus does not \u201ccreat[e] artifi-\ncially high evidentiary barriers.\u201d  Pet. Br. 35.  And it \ndoes not obstruct \u201csuits by unregulated plaintiffs who \nare adversely affected by an agency\u2019s regulation of oth-\ners.\u201d  Corner Post, Inc. v. Bd. of Governors of Fed. Rsrv. \nSys., 603 U.S. 799, 826 (2024) (Kavanaugh, J., concur-\nring).  It simply ensures that any such suits are \n \n19 Those declarations are not before this Court because the court \nof appeals held that petitioners failed to establish good cause for \ntheir untimely filing, see Pet. App. 31a-32a, and petitioners did \nnot seek review of that ruling, see Pet. I; State Opp. 14-15.  In any \nevent, the declarants did not account for 2022 market conditions.  \nSee J.A. 213-222.  As to redressability, they merely asserted that \nautomakers \u201clikely would change their production, pricing, \nand/or distribution plans for Model Year 2025\u201d absent Califor-\nnia\u2019s standards.  J.A. 215, 220.  They offered no supporting de-\ntails, and focused instead on the distinct question of how quickly \nautomakers could change their fleets and prices. \n\n \n37 \n \nbrought by plaintiffs who are, in fact, adversely af-\nfected by the challenged action and would benefit from \na favorable decision.     \nNext, petitioners argue that the \u201cdecision below \ncreates troubling incentives for agencies.\u201d  Pet. Br. 43.  \nThey assert that agencies may now \u201ctarget entire in-\ndustries with crippling burdens so long as they act \nthrough a conduit and placate that conduit.\u201d  Id.20  \nAgain, however, a plaintiff whose sales are crippled as \nthe result of an agency action can invoke numerous \nsources to demonstrate a likelihood that vacatur \nwould increase sales.  Nor does this case present any \nvalid concern about \u201cencourag[ing] agencies to act over \nshorter time horizons.\u201d  Pet. Br. 44.  The underlying \nwaiver was granted in 2013 and addressed standards \nthat increased in stringency through model year 2025.  \nAny jurisdictional difficulties petitioners confronted \nresulted primarily from their own choice not to chal-\nlenge the original 2013 action.  See supra p. 18 n.7. \nFinally, petitioners argue that the court of appeals \n\u201ccreate[d] a one-way ratchet in favor of the regulator \nover the regulated\u201d by requiring petitioners to intro-\nduce evidence of standing.  Pet. Br. 44.  They contrast \nthat requirement with the principle that \u201c[a] State will \n \n20 Petitioners note that several automakers entered voluntary \nagreements with California in 2020 to continue producing more \nlow- and zero-emission vehicles.  See Pet. App. 13a-14a.  But that \nwas not a \u201ctroubling\u201d effort by EPA to \u201cinsulate\u201d the \u201centire in-\ndustr[y]\u201d from \u201creview.\u201d  Pet. Br. 43.  And petitioners \nacknowledge that \u201cmany\u201d other automakers did not enter any \nsuch agreement.  Id. at 37.  Nothing prevented petitioners from \nattempting to introduce evidence showing that the non-partici-\npating automakers would likely change their fleets in response to \na vacatur of the reinstatement. \n\n \n38 \n \nalways have \u2018a legitimate interest in the continued en-\nforceability of its own statutes.\u2019\u201d  Id. (quoting Maine v. \nTaylor, 477 U.S. 131, 137 (1986)).  But state plaintiffs \ndo introduce evidence where necessary to show that a \nfavorable judgment would redress their injuries.  See, \ne.g., Dep\u2019t of Com., 588 U.S. at 767-768.  And this \nCourt\u2019s recognition that sovereigns have a protectable \ninterest in effectuating their own statutes hardly \namounts to \u201cbad policy.\u201d  Pet. Br. 41; see Maryland v. \nKing, 567 U.S. 1301, 1303 (2012) (Roberts, C.J., in \nchambers); Maine, 477 U.S. at 137. \nThe more relevant policy consideration is the one \nunderlying Article III:  that federal courts have lim-\nited jurisdiction, and a party seeking to invoke that \njurisdiction must show that its claim falls within those \nlimits.  That policy, which reflects the Framers\u2019 vision \nof the proper role of courts in our democratic system, \nsee All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 380, requires \naffirmance here.   \nB. Unsupported Predictions About the Effect \nof a Judgment on a Third Party Are Insuf-\nficient to Establish Redressability \nPetitioners\u2019 alternative theory for why they did not \nneed to introduce evidence of redressability fails for \nsimilar reasons.  They contend that plaintiffs can es-\ntablish standing simply by asserting that the \u201ceffects \nof the challenged government action on third parties\u201d \nare \u201cpredictable\u201d\u2014and that \u201cno more is needed.\u201d  Pet. \nBr. 18.  The cases petitioners invoke for that argument \nactually demonstrate the opposite.   \nPetitioners portray Department of Commerce as \nholding that unsupported inferences and predictions \nabout \u201cthird-party behavior . . . can suffice\u201d to estab-\nlish standing.  Pet. Br. 30; see id. at 31.  In truth, that \ndecision examined whether the plaintiffs \u201cha[d] met \n\n \n39 \n \ntheir burden of showing that third parties will likely \nreact in predictable ways\u201d to a citizenship question on \nthe 2020 census, and thereby cause harm to the plain-\ntiffs.  Dep\u2019t of Com., 588 U.S. at 768 (emphasis added).  \nThe Court answered that question in the affirmative \nonly after reviewing the district court\u2019s \u201cfindings of \nfact\u201d\u2014based on extensive \u201cevidence\u201d\u2014which \u201cestab-\nlished a sufficient likelihood that the reinstatement of \na citizenship question\u201d would depress census response \nrates.  Id. at 767; see New York v. Dep\u2019t of Com., 351 F. \nSupp. 3d 502, 578-581 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (describing ex-\npert testimony, statistical data, and agency memo-\nranda).  The Court did not rely on \u201cspeculation\u201d or \npredictions alone.  Dep\u2019t of Com., 588 U.S. at 768.21 \nNor can petitioners dismiss the significance of the \nevidence before the Court in Department of Commerce \non the ground that it merely recounted \u201chistorical \npractice.\u201d  Pet. Br. 31.  The plaintiffs in that case did \nnot just reference the result of questions on prior cen-\nsuses.  They introduced detailed evidence that \u201cover-\nwhelmingly support[ed] the conclusion that the \naddition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census \nwill cause a significant net differential decline in self-\nresponse rates among noncitizen households.\u201d  New \nYork, 351 F. Supp. 3d at 578 (emphasis added). \nThe remaining authorities discussed by petitioners \n(Pet. Br. 31) do not advance their theory either.  The \nstanding analysis in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. \n497, 526 (2007), turned on evidence that included \u201cpe-\ntitioners\u2019 uncontested affidavits.\u201d  That evidence \n \n21 See also California, 593 U.S. at 678 (explaining that the plain-\ntiffs in Department of Commerce \u201crelied not only on \u2018the predict-\nable effect of Government action on the decisions of third parties\u2019 \nbut also on comprehensive studies, rather than mere \u2018specula-\ntion\u2019\u201d). \n\n \n40 \n \nshowed that \u201cthe United States transportation sector \nemit[ted] . . .  more than 6% of worldwide carbon diox-\nide emissions,\u201d id. at 524; that there was \u201ca causal con-\nnection between manmade greenhouse gas emissions \nand global warming,\u201d id. at 523, see id. at 525; and \nthat \u201c[a] reduction in domestic emissions\u201d resulting \nfrom the requested relief \u201cwould slow the pace of \nglobal emissions increases,\u201d providing partial redress \nfor petitioners\u2019 undisputed injuries, id. at 526; see id. \nat 522-523.22  In Skyline Wesleyan Church v. Califor-\nnia Department of Managed Health Care, 968 F.3d \n738, 750 (9th Cir. 2020), the plaintiff similarly offered \n\u201cevidence\u201d that regulatory enforcement had caused \nhealth insurers to abandon restrictions on abortion \ncoverage.  Specifically, \u201cseven insurers had offered \nplans with abortion coverage restrictions\u201d consistent \nwith plaintiff\u2019s religious beliefs, then \u201call seven com-\nplied\u201d with a regulator\u2019s warning to stop offering such \nplans.  Id. at 750.  Both decisions thus turned on ac-\ntual evidence, not unsupported predictions. \nPetitioners nonetheless advance a blanket rule \nthat no evidence is required if \u201cthe behavior of third \nparties is predictable rather than speculative.\u201d  Pet. \nBr. 30.  They further contend that only \u201cthree \ncircumstances\u201d exist in which third-party behavior is \nsufficiently speculative to require evidence of redress-\nability:  (i) where a plaintiff\u2019s theory relies on \u201c\u2018coun-\nterintuitive\u2019 assumptions,\u201d  id. at 32 (citing California, \n593 U.S. at 678); (ii) where it relies on an attenuated \n\u201cchain of events,\u201d Pet. Br. 32 (citing All. for Hippo-\ncratic Med., 602 U.S. at 386); and (iii) where the \u201clegal \nimpact of a judicial decision is unclear,\u201d Pet. Br. 33 \n \n22 The Court also accorded a \u201cspecial solicitude\u201d to the state peti-\ntioners, which does not apply to the private petitioners here.  \nMassachusetts, 549 U.S. at 520. \n\n \n41 \n \n(citing Murthy, 603 U.S. at 72-73, Brackeen, 599 U.S. \nat 294, and Texas, 599 U.S. at 691 (Gorsuch, J., con-\ncurring in the judgment)). \nThose arguments profoundly misunderstand this \nCourt\u2019s standing doctrine.  Challengers must always \nidentify \u201cevidence\u201d proving \u201c\u2018specific facts\u2019\u201d that estab-\nlish standing.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561; see FW/PBS, \nInc. v. City of Dallas, 493 U.S. 215, 231 (1990).  And \nthis Court\u2019s analysis of standing is \u201cnot a \u2018mechanical \nexercise\u2019\u201d\u2014particularly when it comes to suits (like \nthis one) \u201cby unregulated parties against the govern-\nment.\u201d  All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 384.  In \nsome cases, \u201cfamiliar circumstances\u201d make standing \n\u201clikely,\u201d id., and a plaintiff might be able to meet its \nburden with less evidence.  In other cases, like those \nreferenced by petitioners, the Court has pointed to cir-\ncumstances calling for \u201cfar stronger evidence\u201d of cau-\nsation and redressability.  E.g., California, 593 U.S. at \n678.  But those circumstances are not the only ones in \nwhich plaintiffs are required to introduce any evi-\ndence.  \nPetitioners\u2019 own arguments illustrate the folly of \ntheir proposed rule.  Invoking Summers v. Earth Is-\nland Institute, 555 U.S. 488, 494 (2009), petitioners ar-\ngue (Pet. Br. 34) that \u201cit is predictable that when the \ngovernment \u2018regulates parks, national forests, or bod-\nies of water,\u2019 it will affect the users of those natural \nresources.\u201d  \u201cIn all such cases,\u201d id., petitioners assert, \nno \u201c[r]ecord evidence is required,\u201d id. at 30.  But Sum-\nmers held exactly the opposite.  It reiterated that a \nplaintiff \u201cbears the burden of showing that he has \nstanding.\u201d  Summers, 555 U.S. at 493.  The Court in-\nsisted on particular evidence showing that the chal-\nlenged regulations would affect a specific site that at \nleast one of plaintiffs\u2019 members had \u201ca specific and \n\n \n42 \n \nconcrete plan\u201d to visit.  Id. at 495.  And it rejected a \n\u201chitherto unheard-of test\u201d that would premise stand-\ning on a \u201cprobability\u201d that \u201csome (unidentified) mem-\nbers have planned to visit some (unidentified) small \nparcels affected by the Forest Service\u2019s procedures and \nwill suffer (unidentified) concrete harm as a result.\u201d  \nId. at 497-498.  That sort of predictive approach\u2014un-\nsupported by concrete evidence\u2014would \u201cmake a mock-\nery of\u201d the Court\u2019s \u201cprior cases.\u201d  Id. at 498. \nC. The Duration of the Waiver Does Not, By \nItself, Establish Standing \nPetitioners also contend that they were excused \nfrom submitting evidence because the \u201cwaiver for cer-\ntain California standards does not sunset.\u201d  Pet. Br. \n19.  But the fact that the greenhouse-gas standards \nplateau starting in model year 2025, and continue at \nthe same levels in future years, supra p. 6, does not \nchange the analysis.   \n1.  Petitioners reason that because those standards \n\u201cdo not expire,\u201d a judicial vacatur \u201cwould necessarily \nhave some effect on vehicle pricing, production, or dis-\ntribution at some future point.\u201d  Pet. Br. 46 (emphasis \nadded).  This Court has previously rejected that kind \nof reasoning.  See Summers, 555 U.S. at 496 (state-\nments of \u201c\u2018some day\u2019 intentions,\u201d without \u201cany specifi-\ncation of when the some day will be,\u201d are insufficient \nto establish standing); Lujan, 504 U.S. at 564 (same).  \nAnd for good reason.  Statutes and regulations often \ndo not sunset.  The mere longevity of a challenged reg-\nulation is no substitute for \u201cspecific, concrete facts \ndemonstrating that\u201d the plaintiff is harmed by the \ngovernment\u2019s action and \u201cpersonally would benefit in \na tangible way from the court\u2019s intervention.\u201d  Warth, \n422 U.S. at 508. \n\n \n43 \n \nIn this case, moreover, the facts belie petitioners\u2019 \nassertion (Pet. Br. 19) that the duration of the green-\nhouse-gas standards eliminates any \u201cplausible dis-\npute\u201d about redressability.  By the time of this suit, \nsales of battery-electric vehicles far exceeded original \nforecasts, and those vehicles generate an outsized \nnumber of ZEV credits and produce very few green-\nhouse-gas emissions.  See supra pp. 6, 21-22.  Petition-\ners did not submit any evidence that the market would \nreverse course if those standards were no longer in \nplace in future years.  See supra p. 25. \nNor does the court of appeals\u2019 apparent misunder-\nstanding about the temporal scope of the greenhouse-\ngas standards (Pet. Br. 45) compel a different outcome.  \nThe court of appeals lacked jurisdiction because peti-\ntioners failed to introduce evidence showing that au-\ntomakers would likely respond to vacatur by \u201cselling \nfewer non-conventional vehicles or by altering the \nprices of their vehicles such that fewer non-conven-\ntional vehicles\u2014and more conventional vehicles\u2014\nwere sold.\u201d  Pet. App. 22a; see id. at 29a-30a.  The \ncourt\u2019s belief that the challenge before it \u201cconcern[ed] \nonly\u201d the reinstatement of the waiver \u201cas to Model \nYears 2017 through 2025,\u201d was a consideration that \n\u201cfurther complicated\u201d the redressability analysis.  Id. \nat 22a (emphasis added); see id. at 24a.  Setting aside \nthat additional perceived complication does not make \nup for petitioners\u2019 failure to introduce any evidence ad-\ndressing how automakers would likely respond to a \nvacatur in May 2022.  See U.S. Opp. 12-14. \n2.  Relatedly, petitioners fault EPA and the court \nof appeals for the court\u2019s \u201cincorrect\u201d premise about the \nduration of the waiver, Pet. Br. 45, which they contend \ncaused the court to improperly \u201cconflate[] mootness \n\n \n44 \n \nand redressability,\u201d id. at 39.  Those arguments are \npuzzling. \nIt has never been a secret that California\u2019s \u201cgreen-\nhouse-gas emission standards applied to model year \n2025 \u2018and subsequent.\u2019\u201d  Pet. Br. 45-46 (quoting J.A. \n50).  That was plainly described in the California Code \nof Regulations. See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \n\u00a7 1961.3(a)(1)(A); see also Cal. Code Regs., tit. 13, \n\u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2012) (similar wording in originally \nenacted ZEV provision).  Petitioners imply that the \nlower court\u2019s confusion about the duration of the \nwaiver arose because EPA failed to \u201ccandidly ex-\nplain[]\u201d the matter until the certiorari stage.  Pet. Br. \n45; see id. at 46.  But the more likely culprit was peti-\ntioners\u2019 opening brief below, which told the court that \npetitioners were challenging a program \u201ccover[ing] ve-\nhicles from model years 2015 through 2025.\u201d  C.A. Pri-\nvate Pet. Br. 9; see also C.A. Oral Arg. 33:55-34:13 \n(argument of petitioners\u2019 counsel that, to defeat stand-\ning, \u201cthe Government would need to come forward \nwith some evidence that [automakers have] now \nplanned around the restatement in a way that couldn\u2019t \nbe withdrawn by 2025\u201d). \nThe lack of clarity on this point was perhaps un-\nderstandable:  petitioners\u2019 central focus in this case \nhas always been on the ZEV standards, which will ex-\npire after model year 2025.  Pet. Br. 46.  That may be \nwhy petitioners urged this Court to resolve the merits \nof their statutory claim before \u201cCalifornia\u2019s waiver ex-\npires at the end of model year 2025,\u201d Pet. 26, even af-\nter they had belatedly acknowledged that the \ngreenhouse-gas standards apply to \u201cModel Years \n\u20182025 and subsequent,\u2019\u201d C.A. Private Pet. Proposed \nSupp. Br. 5.  But whatever the source of the confusion \n\n \n45 \n \nbelow, it did not matter to the ultimate outcome.  Re-\ngardless of the waiver\u2019s duration, petitioners failed to \nshow that automakers would respond to its reinstate-\nment (either sooner or later) by making changes that \nwould increase fuel sales.   \nIn the face of that failure, the court of appeals cor-\nrectly explained why its decision was based on stand-\ning, not mootness:  The jurisdictional problem was not \nthat petitioners\u2019 \u201cstanding arguments were sufficient \nwhen originally filed\u201d and then were \u201cmooted by the \npassage of time.\u201d  Pet. App. 25a; see generally Already, \nLLC v. Nike, Inc., 568 U.S. 85, 91 (2013).  Petitioners\u2019 \n\u201cstanding arguments were deficient from the start.\u201d  \nPet. App. 25a.  By the time petitioners filed their chal-\nlenge in May 2022, shifts in consumer demand and \nother transformations in the market made it specula-\ntive (at best) that vacating the reinstatement would \nlead to increased fuel sales in the future.  Petitioners \nnever even attempted to introduce evidence demon-\nstrating that vacatur of the reinstatement would have \nthe effects on automakers that they predicted.  Pet. \nApp. 29a-30a.   \nD. Petitioners\u2019 Post Hoc Attempts to Identify \nEvidence on Redressability Fail to Estab-\nlish Standing \nFinally, petitioners argue that if they \u201cwere legally \nrequired to produce record evidence to support re-\ndressability, plenty such evidence existed.\u201d  Pet. \nBr. 37.  But the few documents that petitioners cited \nin the court of appeals did not establish any likelihood \nthat a vacatur in 2022 would increase fuel sales, as \ndetailed in Part I.C above.  And the additional materi-\nals petitioners now point this Court to would not have \nestablished redressability even if petitioners had in-\nvoked them in a timely fashion below. \n\n \n46 \n \nPetitioners first highlight (Pet. Br. 38) a statement \nfrom an appendix to California\u2019s 2021 comment letter \nregarding the reinstatement.  See J.A. 84.  But that \nstatement relied on forecasts from 2017.  See J.A. 85 \nn.17 (citing January 2017 analysis of regulation com-\npliance scenarios); id. at 85 n.18 (citing February 2017 \nmodeling scenario).  By 2022, the earlier projections \nhad been overtaken by actual events.  See J.A. 191 (na-\ntional market share of zero-emission vehicles \u201calmost \ntripled\u201d in the period \u201cbetween 2020 and the third \nquarter of 2022\u201d). \nPetitioners also invoke declarations that the state \nrespondents filed along with their motion to intervene, \nshortly after petitioners initiated this suit.  See Pet. \nBr. 13, 34.  Those declarations (like petitioners\u2019) as-\nserted a conclusory \u201cexpect[ation]\u201d that additional \ngasoline-fueled vehicles would be sold if California\u2019s \nstandards were not in place.  J.A. 110, 111; see id. at \n115-116.  The lack of any details or contemporaneous \nevidence for those assertions reflected both time con-\nstraints (the intervention declarations were signed \nfour days after the case commenced) and the reality \nthat the States\u2019 standing and entitlement to intervene \nwere independently established for other reasons.  Cf. \nKing, 567 U.S. at 1303 (reasoning that a State suffers \n\u201congoing irreparable harm\u201d any time it \u201cis enjoined by \na court from effectuating . . . a duly enacted statute\u201d). \nAnother document referenced by petitioners (Pet. \nBr. 47) is outside the record and post-dates the deci-\nsion below:  EPA\u2019s recent request for public comment \non its proposal to incorporate the greenhouse-gas \nstandards of the Advanced Clean Cars I program into \nCalifornia\u2019s state implementation plan.  See 89 Fed. \nReg. 82,553 (Oct. 11, 2024); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7407.  To be \nsure, the underlying state estimates referenced in that \n\n \n47 \n \nproposal (see 89 Fed. Reg. at 82,557 & nn.19-20) are \npart of the record, because California submitted them \nto EPA in 2021 in connection with the reinstatement \nproceedings.  See C.A. J.A. 276.  But petitioners never \ninvoked those submissions below.  And the estimates \ntook as their baseline a projection of zero-emission ve-\nhicle penetration based on 2019 data, which did not \nanticipate the dramatic increase in sales in the follow-\ning years.23   \nNone of the materials that petitioners belatedly \nreference could have satisfied their burden to submit \nevidence about how the market would respond to va-\ncatur of the reinstatement in May 2022.  And the fact \nthat they were not \u201cset forth\u201d as \u201cthe basis for the \nclaim of standing\u201d below poses another insuperable \nobstacle for petitioners.  D.C. Cir. R. 28(a)(7).  As this \nCourt recently reminded litigants, \u201c\u2018judges are not like \npigs, hunting for truffles buried in the record.\u2019\u201d  \nMurthy, 603 U.S. at 67 n.7 (alterations omitted).  The \ncourt of appeals could not reasonably be expected to \nfocus on a few sentences scattered across thousands of \npages of record materials, which were never raised in \npetitioners\u2019 briefs.  Nor could it be expected to recall \nisolated assertions in two declarations, filed in support \nof one of five unopposed motions to intervene, that \nwere disposed of by the Clerk more than a year before \noral argument.  See C.A. Order (June 30, 2022). \nIn the end, petitioners are right that this case is \n\u201csimple\u201d (Pet. Br. 47)\u2014but not in the way they sug-\ngest.  They had the burden to introduce evidence es-\ntablishing that their claim was redressable.  Instead \n \n23  See C.A. J.A. 277 (explaining reliance on \u201cEMFAC 2021\u201d \nmodel); Cal. Air Res. Bd., EMFAC 2021 Volume III Technical \nDocument, at 6 (April 2021), https://tinyurl.com/2wsxz4uy (ex-\nplaining use of DMV data through 2019). \n\n \n48 \n \nof meeting that obligation head-on, they treated re-\ndressability as an afterthought\u2014relying on assump-\ntions and conclusory assertions, supplemented only by \noutdated projections.  And when confronted with cur-\nrent evidence from the state respondents undermining \ntheir assumption that vacatur of the reinstatement in \nMay 2022 would lead to increased fuel sales, petition-\ners offered no evidentiary response.  Because petition-\ners failed to introduce specific facts and evidence \nestablishing a likelihood of redressability, the court of \nappeals properly held that it could not reach the mer-\nits. \n\n \n49 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be af-\nfirmed. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \nROB BONTA \nAttorney General of California \nMICHAEL J.

This search action moves to the next logical and critical step: finding the petitioners' direct rebuttal to this dispositive argument.\n\nTask EIG is very high (0.9) because the petitioners' reply brief is the most likely place to find their strongest counter-arguments to the very reasoning that caused them to lose below. Understanding the strength, nature, and legal basis of their rebuttal on the 'voluntary action/market forces' point is essential to predicting whether the Supreme Court will find their standing argument persuasive. The results will directly inform the core of the prediction.\n\nDesign EIG is high (0.7) because this action exemplifies a sophisticated and generalizable legal analysis strategy: after identifying the dispositive issue in a lower court opinion, specifically search the appellant's/petitioner's reply brief for their direct counter-argument. This refines the agent's methodology from general issue-spotting to analyzing the direct back-and-forth of appellate argumentation, which is a key skill for SCOTUS prediction. It demonstrates the value of targeting specific document types (reply briefs) for specific purposes (finding rebuttals).",

See 42 \nU.S.C. 7543(a) and (b).  In 2013, EPA issued a waiver to \nallow California to impose certain vehicle-emissions \nstandards.  EPA partially withdrew that waiver in 2019 \nbut reinstated it in 2022.  Petitioners, who had not chal-\nlenged the 2013 waiver, then challenged EPA\u2019s 2022 re-\ninstatement decision.  The questions presented are as \nfollows: \n1. Whether petitioners have established the re-\ndressability component of Article III standing.  \n2. Whether EPA correctly interpreted 42 U.S.C. \n7543(b) when the agency granted California a waiver in \n2013 and reinstated that waiver in 2022.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n(III) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage\nOpinion below ................................................................................ 1 \nJurisdiction .................................................................................... 1 \nStatement ...................................................................................... 1 \nArgument ....................................................................................... 9 \nA. \nThe court of appeals\u2019 redressability holding does \nnot warrant this court\u2019s review .................................... 10 \nB. \nThis Court should not grant certiorari on a novel \nstatutory issue that no court has addressed ............... 19 \nConclusion ................................................................................... 28 \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES \nCases: \nAmerican Trucking Ass\u2019ns v.

App. 1a-49a) \nis reported at 98 F.4th 288.   \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nApril 9, 2024.  The petition for a writ of certiorari was \nfiled on July 2, 2004.  The jurisdiction of this Court is \ninvoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \nSTATEMENT \n1. Congress enacted the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act), \n42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq., \u201cto protect and enhance the qual-\nity of the Nation\u2019s air resources so as to promote the \npublic health and welfare and the productive capacity of \nits population,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 7401(b)(1).  Under the Act, \neach State generally has flexibility to determine how it \n\n2 \n \nwill meet air-quality goals.  Pet. App. 3a.  For \u201cnew mo-\ntor vehicles,\u201d however, the Act directs the Environmen-\ntal Protection Agency (EPA) to prescribe nationwide \n\u201cstandards applicable to the emission of any air pollu-\ntant  * * *  which in [its] judgment cause[s], or contrib-\nute[s] to, air pollution which may reasonably be antici-\npated to endanger public health or welfare.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n7521(a)(1).  Section 209(a) of the Act generally preempts \nany \u201cState or any political subdivision thereof\u200a\u201d from \n\u201cadopt[ing] or attempt[ing] to enforce any standard re-\nlating to the control of emissions from new motor vehi-\ncles.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7543(a).    \nIn turn, Section 209(b) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7543(b), \ncreates an exception to that preemption rule.  Section \n209(b) generally requires EPA to \u201cwaive application of \n[Section 209(a)] to any State which has adopted stand-\nards  * * *  for the control of emissions from new motor \nvehicles or new motor vehicle engines prior to March \n30, 1966, if the State determines that the State stand-\nards will be, in the aggregate, at least as protective of \npublic health and welfare as applicable Federal stand-\nards.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7543(b)(1).  Section 209(b) further \nspecifies, however, that \u201c[n]o such waiver shall be \ngranted if the Administrator finds that\u201d:  \u201c(A) the de-\ntermination of the State is arbitrary and capricious, (B) \nsuch State does not need such State standards to meet \ncompelling and extraordinary conditions, or (C) such \nState standards and accompanying enforcement proce-\ndures are not consistent with section 7521(a) of this ti-\ntle.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7543(b)(1)(A)-(C).   \nCalifornia is the only State that regulated vehicle \nemissions before March 30, 1966, so it is the only State \nthat is eligible for a waiver under Section 209(b).  En-\ngine Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 88 F.3d 1075, 1079 n.9 (D.C. \n\n3 \n \nCir. 1996).  Congress made a waiver available to Cali-\nfornia because, at the time the CAA was enacted, the \nState \u201cwas already the \u2018lead[er] in the establishment of \nstandards for regulation of automotive pollutant emis-\nsions\u2019 at a time when the federal government had yet to \npromulgate any regulations of its own.\u201d  Id. at 1079 (ci-\ntation omitted; brackets in original).  Congress also rec-\nognized \u201cthe unique problems facing California as a re-\nsult of its climate and topography.\u201d  H.R. Rep. No. 728, \n90th Cong., 1st Sess. 22 (1967).  \nUnder the original 1967 CAA provision, a waiver of \npreemption was available only if California\u2019s standards \nwere \u201cmore stringent than applicable Federal stand-\nards.\u201d  Air Quality Act of 1967, Pub. L. No. 90-148, \n\u00a7 208(b), 81 Stat. 501.  In 1977, Congress amended Sec-\ntion 209(b) to \u201cexpand California\u2019s flexibility to adopt a \ncomplete program of motor vehicle emissions control.\u201d  \nMotor & Equipment Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 627 F.2d 1095, \n1110-1111 (D.C. Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 446 U.S. 952 \n(1980); see Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977 (1977 \namendments), Pub. L. No. 95-95, \u00a7\u202f207, 91 Stat. 755.  \nThe 1977 amendments added language (quoted above) \nspecifying that, to obtain a waiver, California need only \ndetermine that its standards \u201cwill be, in the aggregate, \nat least as protective\u201d as federal standards.  \u00a7\u202f207, 91 \nStat. 755.  The 1977 amendments also allowed other \nStates to \u201cadopt and enforce\u201d vehicle-emissions stand-\nards that \u201care identical to the California standards for \nwhich a waiver has been granted for such model year.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. 7507(1); see \u00a7 177(1), 91 Stat. 750. \nSince the CAA\u2019s enactment, EPA has granted 75 \nSection 209(b) waivers for California\u2019s vehicle-emis-\nsions program.  Pet. App. 9a.  In 1993, EPA granted a \nwaiver for California\u2019s \u201c\u200a\u2018Zero Emission Vehicle\u2019 pro-\n\n4 \n \nduction requirement,\u201d which required an annually in-\ncreasing percentage of vehicles sold in California to pro-\nduce zero on-road emissions.  58 Fed. Reg. 4166, 4166 \n(Jan. 13, 1993).  And in 2009, EPA granted a waiver for \nCalifornia\u2019s first set of greenhouse-gas emission stand-\nards.  74 Fed. Reg. 32,744, 32,745-32,747 (July 8, 2009).  \nDespite its substantial regulatory efforts, California \n\u201ccontinue[s] to face significant pollution and climate \nchallenges.\u201d  Pet. App. 10a.  California is home to seven \nof the Nation\u2019s ten worst areas for ozone pollution and \nsix of the Nation\u2019s ten worst areas for small particulate \nmatter.  See 87 Fed. Reg. 14,332 14,377 n.469 (Mar. 14, \n2022).  And the State \u201cis particularly impacted by cli-\nmate change,\u201d including through \u201cincreasing risks from \nrecord-setting fires, heat waves, storm surges, sea-level \nrise, water supply shortages and extreme heat.\u201d  Id. at \n14,365; see id. at 14,334 n.10. \n2. This case concerns a set of emissions standards, \nknown as the Advanced Clean Car (ACC) program, that \nCalifornia adopted in 2012.  That program includes a \nlow-emission-vehicle program, which (as relevant here) \nestablishes \u201cstandards to regulate [greenhouse-gas] \nemissions.\u201d  78 Fed. Reg. 2112, 2114 (Jan. 9, 2013).  It \nalso includes a zero-emission-vehicle program, which \nrequires a certain percentage of manufacturers\u2019 fleets \nto be zero-emission vehicles.  See id. at 2114-2115.  Un-\nder the ACC as originally constructed, both the low-\nemission-vehicle program and the zero-emission-vehicle \nprogram increase in stringency through model-year \n2025.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1961.3(a)(1)(A) \n(2024); C.A. Admin. R. Doc. 7, at 22; C.A. Admin. R. Doc. \n811, at 1.  After model-year 2025, the programs were \ndesigned to remain in effect, with their stringency held \nconstant at 2025 levels.  See ibid.; see also 78 Fed. Reg. \n\n5 \n \nat 2119 (describing the ACC\u2019s zero-emission-vehicle re-\nquirements as extending through \u201c2025 and beyond\u201d).  \nIn 2013, EPA found \u201cthat the entire ACC program \nme[t] the criteria for a waiver of Clean Air Act preemp-\ntion and thus  * * *  grant[ed] a waiver for [California\u2019s] \nACC program.\u201d  78 Fed. Reg. at 2113; see id. at 2112. \nCalifornia amended its ACC zero-emission-vehicle \nstandards in 2022 so that they expire following model-\nyear 2025.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2 (2024).  \nCalifornia intends to replace those standards as part of \na new program known as ACC II, which includes increas-\ning zero-emission-vehicle requirements from model-\nyear 2026 through model-year 2035 and then holds the \n2035 levels constant for subsequent years.  See id. \n\u00a7 1962.4 (2024).  California has sought a CAA waiver for \nACC II, but EPA has not yet acted on that request.  In \ncontrast, California has not amended the ACC\u2019s low-\nemission-vehicle standards for greenhouse-gas emis-\nsions; those standards will continue to hold greenhouse-\ngas emissions at the stringency level set for model-year \n2025 \nin \n\u201csubsequent\u201d \nmodel \nyears. \n \nSee \nid. \n\u00a7 1961.3(a)(1)(A) (2024). \nIn 2019, \u201cafter car manufacturers had adjusted their \nfleets to comply with California\u2019s Advanced Clean Car \nProgram,\u201d Pet. App. 12a, EPA withdrew California\u2019s \nwaiver for the portions of that program that addressed \nzero-emission vehicles and set low-emission-vehicle \nstandards for greenhouse gases, 84 Fed. Reg. 51,310, \n51,310 (Sept. 27, 2019).  EPA articulated three bases for \nthe withdrawal.  See id. at 51,328-51,341.  First, EPA \nbelieved that portions of the waiver conflicted with a \nthen-recent determination by the National Highway \nTraffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) that state \ngreenhouse-gas regulations like California\u2019s were \n\n6 \n \npreempted by the Energy Policy and Conservation Act \n(EPCA), 49 U.S.C. 32919(a).  84 Fed. Reg. at 51,337-\n51,338.  Second, EPA asserted that Section 209(b) re-\nquires examination of California\u2019s emission standards in \nisolation, rather than \u201cCalifornia\u2019s entire program in \nthe aggregate.\u201d  Id. at 51,341.  Third, EPA determined \nthat California could not demonstrate that its low-emis-\nsion-vehicle standards for greenhouse gases and its \nzero-emission-vehicle regulations were needed to meet \ncompelling and extraordinary conditions because, in \nEPA\u2019s view, California could not show a \u201cparticularized \nnexus\u201d between greenhouse-gas emissions and Califor-\nnia\u2019s air-pollution problems.  Ibid. \nAfter EPA withdrew the 2013 waiver, automobile \nmanufacturers representing nearly 30% of U.S. vehicle \nsales, including Honda, Ford, Volvo, BMW, and Volks-\nwagen, entered into independent agreements with Cal-\nifornia under which the manufacturers would continue \nto meet California\u2019s low-emission-vehicle and zero-\nemission-vehicle standards.  See 87 Fed. Reg. at 14,346 \nn.115.  \u201cAutomakers were motivated to sign these \nagreements by the investments they had already made \nin updating their fleets and growing consumer demand \nfor electric vehicles.\u201d  Pet. App. 14a.   \nIn 2022, EPA reinstated California\u2019s 2013 waiver.  87 \nFed. Reg. at 14,332.  EPA identified three principal \ngrounds for its reinstatement decision.  First, EPA con-\ncluded that it had made procedural errors in 2019 when \nthe agency reconsidered the 2013 waiver.  Id. at 14,333.  \nSecond, EPA determined that the 2019 withdrawal de-\ncision had rested on a faulty interpretation and applica-\ntion of Section 209(b).  Ibid.  Third, the agency found \nthat it had improperly considered NHTSA\u2019s interpre-\n\n7 \n \ntation of EPCA, which NHTSA had since withdrawn in \nany event.  Ibid.; see Pet. App. 14a.   \n3. Petitioners, a group of entities that produce or \nsell liquid fuels and raw materials used to produce those \nfuels, sought judicial review of EPA\u2019s 2022 reinstate-\nment decision in the D.C. Circuit.  See Pet. App. 2a; 42 \nU.S.C. 7607(b)(1).1  Petitioners argued that EPA\u2019s rein-\nstatement decision exceeded the agency\u2019s authority un-\nder Section 209(b).  Pet. App. 3a.  Various States (in-\ncluding California) and localities, automakers, and envi-\nronmental organizations intervened in support of EPA.  \nId. at 15a & nn.4-6.   \nThe court of appeals dismissed petitioners\u2019 claims for \nlack of Article III standing.  Pet. App. 1a-49a.  Petition-\ners asserted that the 2022 reinstatement decision \u201cwill \ncause them economic injury.\u201d  Id. at 16a.  The court con-\ncluded, however, that petitioners had not \u201cmet their \nburden of demonstrating that those injuries are re-\ndressable\u201d by a judicial decree holding the challenged \nEPA decision invalid.  Id. at 19a. \nIn the court of appeals, petitioners \u201cargue[d] that, by \nrequiring vehicle manufacturers to sell vehicles that use \nless or no liquid fuel, California\u2019s [low-emission-vehicle] \nand [zero-emission-vehicle] requirements depress the \ndemand for liquid fuels\u201d that petitioners \u201cproduce and \nsell.\u201d  Pet. App. 19a.  \u201cThe difficulty for\u201d petitioners, the \ncourt observed, \u201cis that their claimed injuries \u2018hinge[] \non\u2019 the actions of third parties\u2014the automobile manu-\nfacturers who are subject to the waiver.\u201d  Id. at 22a \n \n1 A group of 17 States also sought judicial review.  See Pet. App. \n2a & n.1.  Those States have filed a separate petition for a writ of \ncertiorari seeking review of the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision in this case.  \nSee Ohio v. EPA, No. 24-13 (filed July 5, 2024).  The government is \nfiling a separate brief opposing that petition.   \n\n8 \n \n(citation omitted).  The court explained that petitioners\u2019 \n\u201cinjuries would be redressed only if automobile manu-\nfacturers responded to vacatur of the waiver by produc-\ning and selling fewer non-conventional vehicles or by al-\ntering the prices of their vehicles such that fewer non-\nconventional vehicles\u2014and more conventional vehicles \n\u2014were sold.\u201d  Ibid. \nThe court of appeals also observed that \u201credressabil-\nity is further complicated by the relatively short dura-\ntion of the waiver that Petitioners challenge.\u201d  Pet. App. \n22a.  The court stated that petitioners had challenged \nonly EPA\u2019s 2022 decision \u201cto reinstate the waiver it had \npreviously granted California as to Model Years 2017 \nthrough 2025.\u201d  Ibid.  So \u201cto meet their burden of \ndemonstrating redressability,\u201d the court concluded, pe-\ntitioners would need to \u201cdemonstrate a \u2018substantial \nprobability\u2019 not only that automobile manufacturers are \nlikely to respond to a decision of this Court by changing \ntheir fleets in a way that alleviates their injuries in some \nway, but also that automobile manufacturers would do \nso relatively quickly\u2014by Model Year 2025.\u201d  Id. at 23a \n(citation omitted). \nThe court of appeals determined that \u201c[t]he record \nevidence provides no basis\u201d for finding redressability.  \nPet. App. 23a.  The court first noted that petitioners had \n\u201cfail[ed] to point to any evidence affirmatively demon-\nstrating that vacatur of the waiver would be substan-\ntially likely to result in any change to automobile man-\nufacturers\u2019 vehicle fleets by Model Year 2025.\u201d  Ibid.  \nIndeed, the court found that \u201c[t]he only evidence points \nin the opposite direction, indicating that automobile \nmanufacturers need years of lead time to make changes \nto their future model year fleets.\u201d  Ibid., see id. at 23a-\n\n9 \n \n24a (citing rulemaking comments by various automak-\ners). \nThe court of appeals further emphasized record evi-\ndence showing that \u201c\u200a\u2018manufacturers are already selling \nmore qualifying vehicles in California than the State\u2019s \nstandards require,\u2019\u200a\u201d which \u201csuggest[s] that vacatur of \nthe zero-emission-vehicle mandate would not redress \nPetitioners\u2019 injuries.\u201d  Pet. App. 28a (citation omitted).  \nThe court observed that several automobile manufac-\nturers had filed a brief explaining \u201cthat \u2018both internal \nsustainability goals and external market forces\u2019 are \nprompting manufacturers to transition toward electric \nvehicles, irrespective of California\u2019s regulations.\u201d  Id. at \n24a n.8 (citation omitted).  The court thus perceived a \nlack of evidence that \u201cvacatur of the challenged waiver\u201d \nwould \u201cresult in any change on the part of automobile \nmanufacturers.\u201d  Id. at 27a. \nThe court of appeals observed that, \u201c[d]espite the \npaucity of evidence in the record regarding the redress-\nability of their injuries\u201d and \u201cthe relatively short nature \nof the waiver they challenge,\u201d petitioners \u201cseem to have \ntreated redressability as a foregone conclusion.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 24a-25a.  The court noted that petitioners had not \n\u201cattempt[ed] to explain in any detail how their injuries \nare redressable, let alone to \u2018cit[e] any record evidence\u2019 \nor to file \u2018additional affidavits or other evidence suffi-\ncient to support\u2019 redressability.\u201d  Ibid. (citation omit-\nted; second set of brackets in original).  The court there-\nfore had \u201cno basis to conclude that Petitioners\u2019 claims \nare redressable\u2014a necessary element of standing that \nPetitioners bear the burden of establishing.\u201d  Id. at 29a.  \nARGUMENT \nPetitioners ask (Pet. 15-26) this Court to review the \ncourt of appeals\u2019 holding that, in light of \u201cthe record \n\n10 \n \nevidence\u201d in this case, petitioners have not shown that \na favorable judicial ruling would redress their injuries.  \nPet. App. 29a.  The court below applied established Ar-\nticle III principles to the record here and properly con-\ncluded that petitioners had not shown that their injuries \nare redressable. That fact-bound conclusion does not \nconflict with any decision of another court of appeals or \notherwise warrant this Court\u2019s intervention. \nPetitioners also ask (Pet. 26-37) this Court to grant \ncertiorari to consider the merits of their statutory argu-\nment, even though neither the court of appeals nor any \nother court has addressed that argument.  But multiple \nthreshold issues could thwart this Court\u2019s review of that \nargument.  And in any event, this Court traditionally \nacts as a Court of review, not of first view.  Nor is there \nany compelling need to review the statutory issue now, \nparticularly because that same issue is currently pend-\ning before the D.C. Circuit in a separate case.  The pe-\ntition should be denied.     \nA. The Court Of Appeals\u2019 Redressability Holding Does Not \nWarrant This Court\u2019s Review \nApplying settled standing principles to the record \nevidence in this case, the court of appeals held that pe-\ntitioners had failed to establish that their asserted inju-\nries are redressable.  The court\u2019s conclusion was correct \nand does not warrant this Court\u2019s review.       \n1. a. \u201c[I]t is a bedrock principle that a federal court \ncannot redress \u2018injury that results from the independ-\nent action of some third party not before the court.\u2019\u200a\u201d  \nMurthy v. Missouri, 144 S. Ct. 1972, 1986 (2024) (cita-\ntion omitted).  \u201cIn keeping with this principle,\u201d  \nthe Court has \u201c\u200a\u2018been reluctant to endorse standing the-\nories that require guesswork as to how independent  \ndecisionmakers will exercise their judgment.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. \n\n11 \n \n(quoting Clapper v. Amnesty Int\u2019l USA, 568 U.S. 398, \n413 (2013)).  The Court has recently and repeatedly re-\njected, on redressability grounds, claims of Article III \nstanding that depend on such guesswork.  See, e.g., \nMurthy, 144 S. Ct. at 1995; Haaland v. Brackeen, 599 \nU.S. 255, 294 (2023); Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 \nU.S. 555, 568-571 (1992). \nHere, the court of appeals properly observed that pe-\ntitioners\u2019 asserted injuries \u201chinge on the response\u201d of a \n\u201cthird party to the government action,\u201d Defenders of \nWildlife, 504 U.S. at 562\u2014namely, \u201cthe automobile \nmanufacturers who are subject to [EPA\u2019s] waiver.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 22a.  Yet because the 2013 waiver has now been in \neffect for over a decade, automakers have made signifi-\ncant \u201cinvestments\u201d in \u201cupdating their fleets and grow-\ning consumer demand for electric vehicles.\u201d  Id. at 14a.  \nIn addition, \u201c\u200a\u2018both internal sustainability goals and ex-\nternal market forces\u2019 are prompting [them] to transi-\ntion toward electric vehicles, irrespective of California\u2019s \nregulations.\u201d  Id. at 24a n.8 (citation omitted).  And EPA \nhas promulgated federal greenhouse-gas emissions \nstandards that outpace California\u2019s comparable stand-\nards and govern model-years 2023 through 2032 (and \nthen subsequent years).

Reg. 74,434 (Dec. \n30, 2021); 89\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n82: 20240909185927661_certificate.2024-7.json (score: 0.252)\nNo. 24-7 \n \n   \nIN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES    \n    \n  _________________    \n    \n                                DIAMOND ALTERNATIVE ENERGY, LLC., ET AL.

See 42 \nU.S.C. 7543(a) and (b).  In 2013, EPA issued a waiver to \nallow California to impose certain vehicle-emissions \nstandards.  EPA partially withdrew that waiver in 2019 \nbut reinstated it in 2022.  Petitioners, who had not chal-\nlenged the 2013 waiver, then challenged EPA\u2019s 2022 re-\ninstatement decision.  The questions presented are as \nfollows: \n1. Whether petitioners have established the re-\ndressability component of Article III standing.  \n2. Whether EPA correctly interpreted 42 U.S.C. \n7543(b) when the agency granted California a waiver in \n2013 and reinstated that waiver in 2022.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n(III) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage\nOpinion below ................................................................................ 1 \nJurisdiction .................................................................................... 1 \nStatement ...................................................................................... 1 \nArgument ....................................................................................... 9 \nA. \nThe court of appeals\u2019 redressability holding does \nnot warrant this court\u2019s review .................................... 10 \nB. \nThis Court should not grant certiorari on a novel \nstatutory issue that no court has addressed ............... 19 \nConclusion ................................................................................... 28 \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES \nCases: \nAmerican Trucking Ass\u2019ns v.

App. 1a-49a) \nis reported at 98 F.4th 288.   \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nApril 9, 2024.  The petition for a writ of certiorari was \nfiled on July 2, 2004.  The jurisdiction of this Court is \ninvoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \nSTATEMENT \n1. Congress enacted the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act), \n42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq., \u201cto protect and enhance the qual-\nity of the Nation\u2019s air resources so as to promote the \npublic health and welfare and the productive capacity of \nits population,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 7401(b)(1).  Under the Act, \neach State generally has flexibility to determine how it \n\n2 \n \nwill meet air-quality goals.  Pet. App. 3a.  For \u201cnew mo-\ntor vehicles,\u201d however, the Act directs the Environmen-\ntal Protection Agency (EPA) to prescribe nationwide \n\u201cstandards applicable to the emission of any air pollu-\ntant  * * *  which in [its] judgment cause[s], or contrib-\nute[s] to, air pollution which may reasonably be antici-\npated to endanger public health or welfare.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n7521(a)(1).  Section 209(a) of the Act generally preempts \nany \u201cState or any political subdivision thereof\u200a\u201d from \n\u201cadopt[ing] or attempt[ing] to enforce any standard re-\nlating to the control of emissions from new motor vehi-\ncles.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7543(a).    \nIn turn, Section 209(b) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7543(b), \ncreates an exception to that preemption rule.  Section \n209(b) generally requires EPA to \u201cwaive application of \n[Section 209(a)] to any State which has adopted stand-\nards  * * *  for the control of emissions from new motor \nvehicles or new motor vehicle engines prior to March \n30, 1966, if the State determines that the State stand-\nards will be, in the aggregate, at least as protective of \npublic health and welfare as applicable Federal stand-\nards.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7543(b)(1).  Section 209(b) further \nspecifies, however, that \u201c[n]o such waiver shall be \ngranted if the Administrator finds that\u201d:  \u201c(A) the de-\ntermination of the State is arbitrary and capricious, (B) \nsuch State does not need such State standards to meet \ncompelling and extraordinary conditions, or (C) such \nState standards and accompanying enforcement proce-\ndures are not consistent with section 7521(a) of this ti-\ntle.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7543(b)(1)(A)-(C).   \nCalifornia is the only State that regulated vehicle \nemissions before March 30, 1966, so it is the only State \nthat is eligible for a waiver under Section 209(b).  En-\ngine Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 88 F.3d 1075, 1079 n.9 (D.C. \n\n3 \n \nCir. 1996).  Congress made a waiver available to Cali-\nfornia because, at the time the CAA was enacted, the \nState \u201cwas already the \u2018lead[er] in the establishment of \nstandards for regulation of automotive pollutant emis-\nsions\u2019 at a time when the federal government had yet to \npromulgate any regulations of its own.\u201d  Id. at 1079 (ci-\ntation omitted; brackets in original).  Congress also rec-\nognized \u201cthe unique problems facing California as a re-\nsult of its climate and topography.\u201d  H.R. Rep. No. 728, \n90th Cong., 1st Sess. 22 (1967).  \nUnder the original 1967 CAA provision, a waiver of \npreemption was available only if California\u2019s standards \nwere \u201cmore stringent than applicable Federal stand-\nards.\u201d  Air Quality Act of 1967, Pub. L. No. 90-148, \n\u00a7 208(b), 81 Stat. 501.  In 1977, Congress amended Sec-\ntion 209(b) to \u201cexpand California\u2019s flexibility to adopt a \ncomplete program of motor vehicle emissions control.\u201d  \nMotor & Equipment Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 627 F.2d 1095, \n1110-1111 (D.C. Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 446 U.S. 952 \n(1980); see Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977 (1977 \namendments), Pub. L. No. 95-95, \u00a7\u202f207, 91 Stat. 755.  \nThe 1977 amendments added language (quoted above) \nspecifying that, to obtain a waiver, California need only \ndetermine that its standards \u201cwill be, in the aggregate, \nat least as protective\u201d as federal standards.  \u00a7\u202f207, 91 \nStat. 755.  The 1977 amendments also allowed other \nStates to \u201cadopt and enforce\u201d vehicle-emissions stand-\nards that \u201care identical to the California standards for \nwhich a waiver has been granted for such model year.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. 7507(1); see \u00a7 177(1), 91 Stat. 750. \nSince the CAA\u2019s enactment, EPA has granted 75 \nSection 209(b) waivers for California\u2019s vehicle-emis-\nsions program.  Pet. App. 9a.  In 1993, EPA granted a \nwaiver for California\u2019s \u201c\u200a\u2018Zero Emission Vehicle\u2019 pro-\n\n4 \n \nduction requirement,\u201d which required an annually in-\ncreasing percentage of vehicles sold in California to pro-\nduce zero on-road emissions.  58 Fed. Reg. 4166, 4166 \n(Jan. 13, 1993).  And in 2009, EPA granted a waiver for \nCalifornia\u2019s first set of greenhouse-gas emission stand-\nards.  74 Fed. Reg. 32,744, 32,745-32,747 (July 8, 2009).  \nDespite its substantial regulatory efforts, California \n\u201ccontinue[s] to face significant pollution and climate \nchallenges.\u201d  Pet. App. 10a.  California is home to seven \nof the Nation\u2019s ten worst areas for ozone pollution and \nsix of the Nation\u2019s ten worst areas for small particulate \nmatter.  See 87 Fed. Reg. 14,332 14,377 n.469 (Mar. 14, \n2022).  And the State \u201cis particularly impacted by cli-\nmate change,\u201d including through \u201cincreasing risks from \nrecord-setting fires, heat waves, storm surges, sea-level \nrise, water supply shortages and extreme heat.\u201d  Id. at \n14,365; see id. at 14,334 n.10. \n2. This case concerns a set of emissions standards, \nknown as the Advanced Clean Car (ACC) program, that \nCalifornia adopted in 2012.  That program includes a \nlow-emission-vehicle program, which (as relevant here) \nestablishes \u201cstandards to regulate [greenhouse-gas] \nemissions.\u201d  78 Fed. Reg. 2112, 2114 (Jan. 9, 2013).  It \nalso includes a zero-emission-vehicle program, which \nrequires a certain percentage of manufacturers\u2019 fleets \nto be zero-emission vehicles.  See id. at 2114-2115.  Un-\nder the ACC as originally constructed, both the low-\nemission-vehicle program and the zero-emission-vehicle \nprogram increase in stringency through model-year \n2025.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1961.3(a)(1)(A) \n(2024); C.A. Admin. R. Doc. 7, at 22; C.A. Admin. R. Doc. \n811, at 1.  After model-year 2025, the programs were \ndesigned to remain in effect, with their stringency held \nconstant at 2025 levels.  See ibid.; see also 78 Fed. Reg. \n\n5 \n \nat 2119 (describing the ACC\u2019s zero-emission-vehicle re-\nquirements as extending through \u201c2025 and beyond\u201d).  \nIn 2013, EPA found \u201cthat the entire ACC program \nme[t] the criteria for a waiver of Clean Air Act preemp-\ntion and thus  * * *  grant[ed] a waiver for [California\u2019s] \nACC program.\u201d  78 Fed. Reg. at 2113; see id. at 2112. \nCalifornia amended its ACC zero-emission-vehicle \nstandards in 2022 so that they expire following model-\nyear 2025.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2 (2024).  \nCalifornia intends to replace those standards as part of \na new program known as ACC II, which includes increas-\ning zero-emission-vehicle requirements from model-\nyear 2026 through model-year 2035 and then holds the \n2035 levels constant for subsequent years.  See id. \n\u00a7 1962.4 (2024).  California has sought a CAA waiver for \nACC II, but EPA has not yet acted on that request.  In \ncontrast, California has not amended the ACC\u2019s low-\nemission-vehicle standards for greenhouse-gas emis-\nsions; those standards will continue to hold greenhouse-\ngas emissions at the stringency level set for model-year \n2025 \nin \n\u201csubsequent\u201d \nmodel \nyears. \n \nSee \nid. \n\u00a7 1961.3(a)(1)(A) (2024). \nIn 2019, \u201cafter car manufacturers had adjusted their \nfleets to comply with California\u2019s Advanced Clean Car \nProgram,\u201d Pet. App. 12a, EPA withdrew California\u2019s \nwaiver for the portions of that program that addressed \nzero-emission vehicles and set low-emission-vehicle \nstandards for greenhouse gases, 84 Fed. Reg. 51,310, \n51,310 (Sept. 27, 2019).  EPA articulated three bases for \nthe withdrawal.  See id. at 51,328-51,341.  First, EPA \nbelieved that portions of the waiver conflicted with a \nthen-recent determination by the National Highway \nTraffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) that state \ngreenhouse-gas regulations like California\u2019s were \n\n6 \n \npreempted by the Energy Policy and Conservation Act \n(EPCA), 49 U.S.C. 32919(a).  84 Fed. Reg. at 51,337-\n51,338.  Second, EPA asserted that Section 209(b) re-\nquires examination of California\u2019s emission standards in \nisolation, rather than \u201cCalifornia\u2019s entire program in \nthe aggregate.\u201d  Id. at 51,341.  Third, EPA determined \nthat California could not demonstrate that its low-emis-\nsion-vehicle standards for greenhouse gases and its \nzero-emission-vehicle regulations were needed to meet \ncompelling and extraordinary conditions because, in \nEPA\u2019s view, California could not show a \u201cparticularized \nnexus\u201d between greenhouse-gas emissions and Califor-\nnia\u2019s air-pollution problems.  Ibid. \nAfter EPA withdrew the 2013 waiver, automobile \nmanufacturers representing nearly 30% of U.S. vehicle \nsales, including Honda, Ford, Volvo, BMW, and Volks-\nwagen, entered into independent agreements with Cal-\nifornia under which the manufacturers would continue \nto meet California\u2019s low-emission-vehicle and zero-\nemission-vehicle standards.  See 87 Fed. Reg. at 14,346 \nn.115.  \u201cAutomakers were motivated to sign these \nagreements by the investments they had already made \nin updating their fleets and growing consumer demand \nfor electric vehicles.\u201d  Pet. App. 14a.   \nIn 2022, EPA reinstated California\u2019s 2013 waiver.  87 \nFed. Reg. at 14,332.  EPA identified three principal \ngrounds for its reinstatement decision.  First, EPA con-\ncluded that it had made procedural errors in 2019 when \nthe agency reconsidered the 2013 waiver.  Id. at 14,333.  \nSecond, EPA determined that the 2019 withdrawal de-\ncision had rested on a faulty interpretation and applica-\ntion of Section 209(b).  Ibid.  Third, the agency found \nthat it had improperly considered NHTSA\u2019s interpre-\n\n7 \n \ntation of EPCA, which NHTSA had since withdrawn in \nany event.  Ibid.; see Pet. App. 14a.   \n3. Petitioners, a group of entities that produce or \nsell liquid fuels and raw materials used to produce those \nfuels, sought judicial review of EPA\u2019s 2022 reinstate-\nment decision in the D.C. Circuit.  See Pet. App. 2a; 42 \nU.S.C. 7607(b)(1).1  Petitioners argued that EPA\u2019s rein-\nstatement decision exceeded the agency\u2019s authority un-\nder Section 209(b).  Pet. App. 3a.  Various States (in-\ncluding California) and localities, automakers, and envi-\nronmental organizations intervened in support of EPA.  \nId. at 15a & nn.4-6.   \nThe court of appeals dismissed petitioners\u2019 claims for \nlack of Article III standing.  Pet. App. 1a-49a.  Petition-\ners asserted that the 2022 reinstatement decision \u201cwill \ncause them economic injury.\u201d  Id. at 16a.  The court con-\ncluded, however, that petitioners had not \u201cmet their \nburden of demonstrating that those injuries are re-\ndressable\u201d by a judicial decree holding the challenged \nEPA decision invalid.  Id. at 19a. \nIn the court of appeals, petitioners \u201cargue[d] that, by \nrequiring vehicle manufacturers to sell vehicles that use \nless or no liquid fuel, California\u2019s [low-emission-vehicle] \nand [zero-emission-vehicle] requirements depress the \ndemand for liquid fuels\u201d that petitioners \u201cproduce and \nsell.\u201d  Pet. App. 19a.  \u201cThe difficulty for\u201d petitioners, the \ncourt observed, \u201cis that their claimed injuries \u2018hinge[] \non\u2019 the actions of third parties\u2014the automobile manu-\nfacturers who are subject to the waiver.\u201d  Id. at 22a \n \n1 A group of 17 States also sought judicial review.  See Pet. App. \n2a & n.1.  Those States have filed a separate petition for a writ of \ncertiorari seeking review of the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision in this case.  \nSee Ohio v. EPA, No. 24-13 (filed July 5, 2024).  The government is \nfiling a separate brief opposing that petition.   \n\n8 \n \n(citation omitted).  The court explained that petitioners\u2019 \n\u201cinjuries would be redressed only if automobile manu-\nfacturers responded to vacatur of the waiver by produc-\ning and selling fewer non-conventional vehicles or by al-\ntering the prices of their vehicles such that fewer non-\nconventional vehicles\u2014and more conventional vehicles \n\u2014were sold.\u201d  Ibid. \nThe court of appeals also observed that \u201credressabil-\nity is further complicated by the relatively short dura-\ntion of the waiver that Petitioners challenge.\u201d  Pet. App. \n22a.  The court stated that petitioners had challenged \nonly EPA\u2019s 2022 decision \u201cto reinstate the waiver it had \npreviously granted California as to Model Years 2017 \nthrough 2025.\u201d  Ibid.  So \u201cto meet their burden of \ndemonstrating redressability,\u201d the court concluded, pe-\ntitioners would need to \u201cdemonstrate a \u2018substantial \nprobability\u2019 not only that automobile manufacturers are \nlikely to respond to a decision of this Court by changing \ntheir fleets in a way that alleviates their injuries in some \nway, but also that automobile manufacturers would do \nso relatively quickly\u2014by Model Year 2025.\u201d  Id. at 23a \n(citation omitted). \nThe court of appeals determined that \u201c[t]he record \nevidence provides no basis\u201d for finding redressability.  \nPet. App. 23a.  The court first noted that petitioners had \n\u201cfail[ed] to point to any evidence affirmatively demon-\nstrating that vacatur of the waiver would be substan-\ntially likely to result in any change to automobile man-\nufacturers\u2019 vehicle fleets by Model Year 2025.\u201d  Ibid.  \nIndeed, the court found that \u201c[t]he only evidence points \nin the opposite direction, indicating that automobile \nmanufacturers need years of lead time to make changes \nto their future model year fleets.\u201d  Ibid., see id. at 23a-\n\n9 \n \n24a (citing rulemaking comments by various automak-\ners). \nThe court of appeals further emphasized record evi-\ndence showing that \u201c\u200a\u2018manufacturers are already selling \nmore qualifying vehicles in California than the State\u2019s \nstandards require,\u2019\u200a\u201d which \u201csuggest[s] that vacatur of \nthe zero-emission-vehicle mandate would not redress \nPetitioners\u2019 injuries.\u201d  Pet. App. 28a (citation omitted).  \nThe court observed that several automobile manufac-\nturers had filed a brief explaining \u201cthat \u2018both internal \nsustainability goals and external market forces\u2019 are \nprompting manufacturers to transition toward electric \nvehicles, irrespective of California\u2019s regulations.\u201d  Id. at \n24a n.8 (citation omitted).  The court thus perceived a \nlack of evidence that \u201cvacatur of the challenged waiver\u201d \nwould \u201cresult in any change on the part of automobile \nmanufacturers.\u201d  Id. at 27a. \nThe court of appeals observed that, \u201c[d]espite the \npaucity of evidence in the record regarding the redress-\nability of their injuries\u201d and \u201cthe relatively short nature \nof the waiver they challenge,\u201d petitioners \u201cseem to have \ntreated redressability as a foregone conclusion.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 24a-25a.  The court noted that petitioners had not \n\u201cattempt[ed] to explain in any detail how their injuries \nare redressable, let alone to \u2018cit[e] any record evidence\u2019 \nor to file \u2018additional affidavits or other evidence suffi-\ncient to support\u2019 redressability.\u201d  Ibid. (citation omit-\nted; second set of brackets in original).  The court there-\nfore had \u201cno basis to conclude that Petitioners\u2019 claims \nare redressable\u2014a necessary element of standing that \nPetitioners bear the burden of establishing.\u201d  Id. at 29a.  \nARGUMENT \nPetitioners ask (Pet. 15-26) this Court to review the \ncourt of appeals\u2019 holding that, in light of \u201cthe record \n\n10 \n \nevidence\u201d in this case, petitioners have not shown that \na favorable judicial ruling would redress their injuries.  \nPet. App. 29a.  The court below applied established Ar-\nticle III principles to the record here and properly con-\ncluded that petitioners had not shown that their injuries \nare redressable. That fact-bound conclusion does not \nconflict with any decision of another court of appeals or \notherwise warrant this Court\u2019s intervention. \nPetitioners also ask (Pet. 26-37) this Court to grant \ncertiorari to consider the merits of their statutory argu-\nment, even though neither the court of appeals nor any \nother court has addressed that argument.  But multiple \nthreshold issues could thwart this Court\u2019s review of that \nargument.  And in any event, this Court traditionally \nacts as a Court of review, not of first view.  Nor is there \nany compelling need to review the statutory issue now, \nparticularly because that same issue is currently pend-\ning before the D.C. Circuit in a separate case.  The pe-\ntition should be denied.     \nA. The Court Of Appeals\u2019 Redressability Holding Does Not \nWarrant This Court\u2019s Review \nApplying settled standing principles to the record \nevidence in this case, the court of appeals held that pe-\ntitioners had failed to establish that their asserted inju-\nries are redressable.  The court\u2019s conclusion was correct \nand does not warrant this Court\u2019s review.       \n1. a. \u201c[I]t is a bedrock principle that a federal court \ncannot redress \u2018injury that results from the independ-\nent action of some third party not before the court.\u2019\u200a\u201d  \nMurthy v. Missouri, 144 S. Ct. 1972, 1986 (2024) (cita-\ntion omitted).  \u201cIn keeping with this principle,\u201d  \nthe Court has \u201c\u200a\u2018been reluctant to endorse standing the-\nories that require guesswork as to how independent  \ndecisionmakers will exercise their judgment.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. \n\n11 \n \n(quoting Clapper v. Amnesty Int\u2019l USA, 568 U.S. 398, \n413 (2013)).  The Court has recently and repeatedly re-\njected, on redressability grounds, claims of Article III \nstanding that depend on such guesswork.  See, e.g., \nMurthy, 144 S. Ct. at 1995; Haaland v. Brackeen, 599 \nU.S. 255, 294 (2023); Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 \nU.S. 555, 568-571 (1992). \nHere, the court of appeals properly observed that pe-\ntitioners\u2019 asserted injuries \u201chinge on the response\u201d of a \n\u201cthird party to the government action,\u201d Defenders of \nWildlife, 504 U.S. at 562\u2014namely, \u201cthe automobile \nmanufacturers who are subject to [EPA\u2019s] waiver.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 22a.  Yet because the 2013 waiver has now been in \neffect for over a decade, automakers have made signifi-\ncant \u201cinvestments\u201d in \u201cupdating their fleets and grow-\ning consumer demand for electric vehicles.\u201d  Id. at 14a.  \nIn addition, \u201c\u200a\u2018both internal sustainability goals and ex-\nternal market forces\u2019 are prompting [them] to transi-\ntion toward electric vehicles, irrespective of California\u2019s \nregulations.\u201d  Id. at 24a n.8 (citation omitted).  And EPA \nhas promulgated federal greenhouse-gas emissions \nstandards that outpace California\u2019s comparable stand-\nards and govern model-years 2023 through 2032 (and \nthen subsequent years).  See 86 Fed. Reg. 74,434 (Dec. \n30, 2021); 89 Fed. Reg. 27,842 (Apr. 18, 2024); 40 C.F.R. \n86.1818-12.  As a result of these various factors, manu-\nfacturers \u201care already selling more qualifying vehicles \nin California than the State\u2019s standards require.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 28a (citation omitted); see C.A. State Resp.-Inter-\nvenors\u2019 Add. 98 (explaining that \u201cmultiple manufactur-\ners have announced plans to sell substantially more \nzero-emission vehicles in the future than [California\u2019s] \nstandards  * * *  require\u201d).    \n\n12 \n \nDespite that evidence of automakers\u2019 independent \nconduct, petitioners \u201ctreated redressability as a fore-\ngone conclusion.\u201d  Pet. App. 25a.  They did not \u201cat-\ntempt[] to explain in any detail how their injuries are \nredressable, let alone to \u2018cit[e] any record evidence\u2019 or \nto file \u2018additional affidavits or other evidence sufficient \nto support\u2019 redressability.\u201d  Id. at 24a-25a (citation \nomitted; second set of brackets in original).  Petitioners \naccordingly failed to meet their \u201cburden  * * *  to ad-\nduce facts showing that\u201d the third-party automakers \nwould act \u201cin such manner as to  * * *  permit redressa-\nbility of injury.\u201d  Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. at 562. \nThe court of appeals also relied on the \u201cshort dura-\ntion of the waiver that Petitioners challenge.\u201d  Pet. App. \n22a.  The court stated that the case \u201cconcern[s] only the \nEPA\u2019s decision, in March 2022, to reinstate the waiver \nit had previously granted California as to Model Years \n2017 through 2025.\u201d  Ibid.  To support that proposition, \nthe court cited EPA\u2019s 2022 reinstatement decision, \nwhich states that \u201c[a]s a result of this action, EPA\u2019s \n2013 waiver for the ACC program, specifically the \nwaiver for California\u2019s [greenhouse-gas] emission stand-\nards and [zero-emission vehicles] sales mandate re-\nquirements for model years (MYs) 2017 through 2025, \ncomes back into force.\u201d  87 Fed. Reg. at 14,333.   \nContrary to the court of appeals\u2019 suggestion, EPA\u2019s \n2013 waiver does not expire after model-year 2025.  As \nnoted above, in 2013, EPA found \u201cthat the entire ACC \nprogram me[t] the criteria for a waiver of Clean Air Act \npreemption and thus  * * *  grant[ed] a waiver for [Cal-\nifornia\u2019s] ACC program.\u201d  78 Fed. Reg. at 2113.  And \nalthough the 2022 reinstatement decision referenced re-\nquirements applicable through model-year 2025, it also \nnoted that, \u201cin 2013, EPA granted California\u2019s waiver \n\n13 \n \nrequest for the state\u2019s [ACC] program,\u201d and that the \n\u201cresult\u201d of the 2022 action was \u201cthe reinstatement of the \nACC program waiver.\u201d  87 Fed. Reg. at 14,332, 14,367.  \nAs originally constructed, the ACC program increased \nin stringency only through model-year 2025 but still re-\nmained in effect thereafter.  See pp. 4-5, supra.  Even \nnow, following California\u2019s enactment of ACC II, only \nthe ACC\u2019s zero-emission-vehicle program expires after \nmodel-year 2025, while the low-emission-vehicle stand-\nards for greenhouse-gas emissions remain in force \nthereafter (at 2025 levels of stringency).  See p. 5, su-\npra.  Thus, because EPA\u2019s 2013 waiver applied to the \nACC, and the ACC does not fully terminate with model-\nyear 2025, the waiver likewise does not terminate with \nmodel-year 2025.  \nIn this Court, petitioners have not challenged the \ncourt of appeals\u2019 apparent understanding that the 2013 \nwaiver sunsets after model-year 2025.  To the contrary, \npetitioners embrace that understanding (Pet. 26), argu-\ning that the Court\u2019s review of the second question pre-\nsented is urgently necessary \u201c[b]ecause California\u2019s \nwaiver expires at the end of model year 2025.\u201d  See Pet. \n4-5 (similar).  Especially given petitioners\u2019 acceptance \nof the court of appeals\u2019 apparent premise about the \nwaiver\u2019s duration, there is no basis for the Court to \ngrant certiorari to review that premise.              \nMore fundamentally, regardless of the 2013 waiver\u2019s \ncontinuing legal force, the waiver\u2019s practical effects are \ngreatly diminished by intervening changes in the mar-\nket.  The court of appeals considered multiple factors, \nand its ultimate conclusion on redressability was cor-\nrect.  As explained above, record evidence indicates \nthat, because of market forces and other independent \nfactors, \u201cvacatur of the challenged waiver may not \n\n14 \n \nresult in any change on the part of automobile manufac-\nturers.\u201d  Pet. App. 27a.  And petitioners failed to present \ntheir own evidence suggesting otherwise.  On this record \nand in light of petitioners\u2019 presentation, the court \nproperly found that petitioners had \u201cfailed to meet their \nburdens of demonstrating that their claims are redress-\nable.\u201d  Id. at 30a.      \nb. Petitioners\u2019 counterarguments lack merit.  Peti-\ntioners contend (Pet. 18) that, if EPA\u2019s waiver were va-\ncated, \u201cthen the government will no longer be forcing \nautomakers to sell more electric vehicles,\u201d so automak-\ners will \u201cmake more vehicles that run on liquid fuel, or \nthey will adjust their prices.\u201d  According to petitioners \n(ibid.), \u201c[t]hat is Economics 101, not a proposition that \nrequires an affidavit for support.\u201d \nWhile there may be cases where commonsense eco-\nnomic principles can suffice to establish redressability, \nthe court of appeals correctly held that this is not one of \nthem, given the record evidence about the automobile-\nmanufacturing market discussed above.  To be sure, pe-\ntitioners could have sought to offer their own evidence \nshowing that automakers would likely change course if \nthe challenged EPA waiver was vacated.  But petition-\ners instead provided \u201cconclusory\u201d declarations simply \nstating that petitioners\u2019 injuries \u201c\u200a\u2018would be substan-\ntially ameliorated if EPA\u2019s decision were set aside.\u2019\u200a\u201d  \nPet. App. 22a.   \nPetitioners briefly contest (Pet. 19-20) the court of \nappeals\u2019 reading of the declarations in the record.  But \nissues that \u201cturn[] entirely on an interpretation of the \nrecord in one particular case\u201d are the \u201cquintessential \nexample of the kind that [this Court] almost never re-\nview[s].\u201d  Taylor v. Riojas, 592 U.S. 7, 11 (2020) (per \ncuriam) (Alito, J., concurring in the judgment).  In any \n\n15 \n \nevent, petitioners\u2019 reading of the declarations is mis-\ntaken.  The first declaration they cite asserts that Cali-\nfornia\u2019s \u201coriginal waiver request\u201d in 2013 observed that \nthe State \u201caims to reduce emissions through \u2018reductions \nin fuel production.\u2019\u200a\u201d  C.A. Pet. Standing Decl. of Jen-\nnifer M. Swenton at 5-6 (citation omitted).  But that \n2013 statement says nothing about whether\u2014following \nthe years of \u201cinvestments [automakers] had already \nmade in updating their fleets and growing consumer de-\nmand for electric vehicles,\u201d Pet. App. 14a\u2014automakers \nwould still alter their production lines to manufacture \nmore gasoline-fueled cars if EPA\u2019s 2013 waiver were va-\ncated more than a decade later.  Petitioners also cite a \ndeclaration from a California Air Resources Board offi-\ncial stating that, \u201call else being equal,\u201d \u201cit is reasonable \nto expect that\u201d without the waiver \u201cthere would be  * * *  \nadditional gasoline-fueled vehicles produced and sold \nduring these model years.\u201d  C.A. Decl. of Sylvia Vander-\nspek at 11.  But that statement is not accompanied by \nany supporting evidence or explanation, and it conflicts \nwith automakers\u2019 own representations.          \nPetitioners further assert (Pet. 20) that \u201cthe court of \nappeals appeared to require plaintiffs to obtain affida-\nvits from the directly regulated parties\u2014here, the au-\ntomakers.\u201d  But while such affidavits would be one way \nfor petitioners to substantiate their theory of redressa-\nbility, the court below did not suggest that it is the only \nway.  Instead, the court simply noted petitioners\u2019 failure \nto produce any form of evidence indicating that au-\ntomakers would change their conduct in response to a \njudicial ruling in petitioners\u2019 favor.   \nFinally, petitioners\u2019 reliance (Pet. 17, 20) on this \nCourt\u2019s decision in Department of Commerce v. New \nYork, 588 U.S. 752 (2019), is misplaced.  There, the \n\n16 \n \nCourt held that the plaintiff States had standing to chal-\nlenge the government\u2019s reinstatement of a citizenship \nquestion on the census because that action would have \n\u201cresult[ed] in noncitizen households responding to the \ncensus at lower rates than other groups, which in turn \nwould cause them to be undercounted and lead\u201d their \nStates to lose federal funds.  Id. at 767.  The Court held \nthat the States had \u201cmet their burden of showing,\u201d in-\ncluding through historical evidence presented \u201cat trial,\u201d \nthat third-party noncitizens \u201cwill likely react in predict-\nable ways to the citizenship question.\u201d  Id. at 768.  Here, \nby contrast, petitioners presented no record evidence \nthat third-party automakers would react to vacatur of \nEPA\u2019s waiver by altering their fleets or pricing.  Pet. \nApp. 24a-25a.  Department of Commerce therefore does \nnot support petitioners\u2019 position.  \n2. a. Petitioners\u2019 assertion of a circuit conflict (Pet. \n21-24) is misconceived.  None of the decisions they cite \ninvolved record evidence affirmatively indicating that \nindependent third parties would likely not alter their \nconduct if the plaintiffs succeeded on the merits.  Peti-\ntioners identify no decision suggesting that \u201ccommon-\nsense inferences\u201d about third-party conduct (Pet. 24) \nare sufficient even in the face of such evidence.     \nIn NRDC v. NHTSA, 894 F.3d 95 (2018), the Second \nCircuit held that certain environmental groups had \nstanding to challenge an agency\u2019s indefinite delay of a \nrule that \u201cwould have increased civil penalties for viola-\ntions of\u200a\u201d fuel-economy standards.  Id. at 100.  In finding \nredressability, the court emphasized that, \u201cby automak-\ners\u2019 own admission, the increased penalty has the po-\ntential to affect [their] business decisions and compli-\nance approaches.\u201d  Id. at 105.  Here, by contrast, au-\ntomakers\u2019 public statements and actions suggest that \n\n17 \n \nthey would not change their business decisions and \ncompliance approaches even if EPA\u2019s waiver were va-\ncated. \nIn General Land Office v. Biden, 71 F.4th 264 (2023), \nthe Fifth Circuit held that States had standing to chal-\nlenge an agency\u2019s decision to divert funds away from the \nconstruction of a border wall.  Id. at 272-274.  But in \nconcluding that the States\u2019 asserted injuries were re-\ndressable, the court relied heavily on \u201cthe procedural \nposture of a motion to dismiss,\u201d which meant that the \nStates could rely solely on \u201callegations\u201d and were \u201cnot \nyet obliged to produce specific evidence.\u201d  Id. at 274.  By \ncontrast, the procedural posture here\u2014a petition for re-\nview of agency action on a full administrative record\u2014\ndoes require petitioners to produce evidence supporting \nredressability.  See Pet. App. 18a; cf. Defenders of Wild-\nlife, 504 U.S. at 563 (explaining that \u201ceach element [of \nstanding] must be supported in the same way as any \nother matter on which the plaintiff bears the burden of \nproof, i.e., with the manner and degree of evidence re-\nquired at the successive stages of the litigation\u201d).    \nIn Wieland v. HHS, 793 F.3d 949 (8th Cir. 2015), and \nSkyline Wesleyan Church v. California Department of \nManaged Health Care, 968 F.3d 738 (9th Cir. 2020), the \ncourts of appeals considered challenges to laws that had \ncaused insurers to refuse to offer certain plans that \nwould have comported with the plaintiffs\u2019 religious be-\nliefs.  See Skyline Wesleyan, 968 F.3d at 742; Wieland, \n793 F.3d at 951-952.  Both courts found that the plain-\ntiffs\u2019 conscience-based injuries were redressable, be-\ncause \u201cinsurers had previously offered plans that were \nacceptable to [the plaintiffs]\u201d before the challenged \nlaws were enacted and would \u201cpredictabl[y]\u201d do so again \nif those laws were invalidated.  Skyline Wesleyan, 968 \n\n18 \n \nF.3d at 750; see Wieland, 793 F.3d at 957.  But neither \nof those cases involved record evidence suggesting that \nmarket forces would make it unlikely for insurers to \nchange their products.   \nb. Petitioners also assert (Pet. 23-24) an intra-cir-\ncuit conflict with the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision in Energy \nFuture Coalition v. EPA, 793 F.3d 141 (2015).  As an \ninitial matter, any resolution of an intra-circuit disa-\ngreement would be the task of the court of appeals, not \nthis Court.  See Wisniewski v. United States, 353 U.S. \n901, 901-902 (1957) (per curiam).  And petitioners de-\nclined to seek rehearing en banc in this case. \nIn any event, Energy Future Coalition differs mean-\ningfully from this case.  There, biofuel producers sued \nEPA, asserting that an EPA regulation prevented an \nethanol-based fuel from being \u201cuse[d] as a test fuel\u201d by \nvehicle manufacturers.  Energy Future Coalition, 793 \nF.3d at 143.  The court concluded that the biofuel pro-\nducers had standing because \u201cif EPA permitted vehicle \nmanufacturers to use [the ethanol-based fuel] as a test \nfuel, there is substantial reason to think that at least \nsome vehicle manufacturers would use it.\u201d  Id. at 144.  \nIn support of that conclusion, the court cited comments \nfrom Ford Motor Company \u201csaying that it \u2018supports the \ndevelopment and introduction\u2019\u200a\u201d of an ethanol-based \nfuel and \u201cthat the \u2018development of such a fuel would en-\nable the first steps to the development of a new genera-\ntion of highly efficient internal combustion engine vehi-\ncles.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (citation omitted).  Here, the court of ap-\npeals cited automaker comments saying essentially the \nopposite:  That automakers would likely not produce \nmore gasoline-fueled vehicles, even if EPA\u2019s 2013 \nwaiver was vacated.   \n\n19 \n \nc. Finally, petitioners substantially overstate (Pet. \n24-25) the importance of the first question presented.  \nThe court of appeals did not suggest that plaintiffs can \nnever base standing on \u201ccommon-sense inferences \nabout how third parties behave in response to legal bar-\nriers to certain behavior.\u201d  Pet. 24.  Nor did it suggest \nthat parties who are not themselves the subject of a \nchallenged regulation \u201cmust secure the cooperation of a \ndirectly regulated party to establish standing.\u201d  Pet. 25. \nInstead, the court of appeals simply held that, where \nredressability depends on the prospect that a favorable \njudicial ruling will induce independent third parties to \nchange their conduct, and the only pertinent record ev-\nidence shows that those third parties likely will not do \nso, the plaintiff has not satisfied Article III.  The court\u2019s \nredressability holding turned substantially on distinc-\ntive characteristics of the automobile-manufacturing in-\ndustry and the many steps automakers had already \ntaken over several years to comply with\u2014and exceed\u2014\nCalifornia\u2019s standards.  See Pet. App. 23a-24a, 28a.  The \nconsequences of that holding are unlikely to be wide-\nspread. \nB. This Court Should Not Grant Certiorari On A Novel \nStatutory Issue That No Court Has Addressed \nPetitioners ask (Pet. 26-37) this Court to grant certi-\norari not only to review the redressability issue that the \ncourt of appeals decided, but also to resolve the merits \nof their statutory challenge\u2014which neither the court \nbelow nor any other court has addressed.  The Court \nshould reject that request.  This case is an extremely \npoor vehicle for deciding petitioners\u2019 statutory claim, \nand that claim lacks merit in any event.        \n \n1. a. If this Court granted certiorari on the second \nquestion presented, it could not decide that issue on the \n\n20 \n \nmerits unless it first reviewed and rejected the court of \nappeals\u2019 determination that petitioners lack Article III \nstanding.  See Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env\u2019t, \n523 U.S. 83, 94 (1998); pp. 11-16, supra.  In addition, \nEPA has raised another threshold argument that could \nimpede the Court\u2019s review of petitioners\u2019 statutory ar-\ngument:  namely, that EPA\u2019s 2019 decision to withdraw \nthe 2013 waiver was procedurally invalid because it re-\nopened a long-settled adjudication and relied on im-\nproper considerations.  See EPA C.A. Br. 53-58; 87 Fed. \nReg. at 14,344-14,352.  That argument is logically ante-\ncedent to the question whether the reinstatement deci-\nsion properly applies Section 209(b).       \nEven if the Court ultimately concluded that neither \nof those threshold obstacles bars its review of the sec-\nond question presented, a grant of certiorari on that is-\nsue would be contrary to the Court\u2019s usual practice.  \nThis Court ordinarily does not decide merits questions \n\u201cin the first instance\u201d where, as here, the court of ap-\npeals has resolved a case on threshold grounds.  Zivo-\ntofsky v. Clinton, 566 U.S. 189, 201 (2012) (citation omit-\nted).  Instead, when the Court \u201creverse[s] on a thresh-\nold question, [it] typically remand[s] for resolution of \nany claims the lower courts\u2019 error prevented them from \naddressing.\u201d  Ibid.; see, e.g., Bond v. United States, 564 \nU.S. 211, 214 (2011).    \nThat approach would make particular sense here be-\ncause the Court would otherwise be \u201cwithout the benefit \nof\u201d any \u201clower court opinions to guide [its] analysis of \nthe merits.\u201d  Zivotofsky, 566 U.S. at 201.  Indeed, no \ncourt has ever passed on the statutory question raised \nby petitioners.  The fact that this Court would be \u201cthe \nfirst to address the [second] question[] presented\u201d thus \nweighs against review.  Does 1-3 v. Mills, 142 S. Ct. 17, \n\n21 \n \n18 (2021) (Barrett, J., concurring in the denial of appli-\ncation for injunctive relief).       \nFinally, this Court\u2019s resolution of the second ques-\ntion presented would not be outcome-determinative in \nthe circumstances of this case.  Petitioners argue that \nEPA must apply Section 209(b) by evaluating whether \neach individual California emission-reduction standard \nfor which the State has sought a waiver is needed to ad-\ndress \u201cCalifornia\u2019s distinctive local pollution problems.\u201d  \nPet. 28; see Pet. 27-34.  That argument lacks merit, as \nexplained below.  But even if petitioners\u2019 interpretation \nof Section 209(b) were correct, EPA independently de-\ntermined that California\u2019s low-emission-vehicle and \nzero-emission-vehicle standards qualified for waivers \nunder that interpretation.  See 87 Fed. Reg. at 14,334 \n(\u201c[E]ven if the focus is on [California\u2019s] specific stand-\nards, when looking at the record before it, EPA erred \nin [2019] in concluding that California does not have a \ncompelling need for the specific standards at issue.\u201d).  \nIn its 2022 decision to reinstate the 2013 waiver, \nEPA found \u201cthat California is particularly impacted by \nclimate change, including increasing risks from record-\nsetting fires, heat waves, storm surges, sea-level rise, \nwater supply shortages and extreme heat.\u201d  87 Fed. \nReg. at 14,363.  And EPA determined that California \n\u201cneeds\u201d both the low-emission-vehicle and zero-emis-\nsion-vehicle standards to address the \u201ccompelling and \nextraordinary\u201d \u201cclimate-change impacts\u201d that it faces.  \nIbid.  In addition, EPA found that California faces \u201cse-\nrious criteria air pollution problems\u201d and that the zero-\nemission-vehicle standard directly reduces \u201ccriteria \npollutant concentrations in California\u201d by increasing \nthe share of vehicles that produce no criteria pollutants \nwhatsoever.  Id. at 14,363-14,364.  Indeed, California\u2019s \n\n22 \n \nvehicle program has included a zero-emission-vehicle \nstandard since 1990 for precisely that reason.  See id. at \n14,363.  Accordingly, EPA concluded that California\u2019s \nlow-emission-vehicle and zero-emission-vehicle stand-\nards were \u201cparticularly relevant\u201d to reducing \u201cCalifor-\nnia\u2019s air pollution problems.\u201d  Id. at 14,366. \nb. Petitioners ask (Pet. 36) this Court to ignore all of \nthe foregoing jurisdictional and prudential obstacles be-\ncause they contend that the second question presented \n\u201chas for too long evaded this Court\u2019s review,\u201d and that \n\u201c[t]he challenged waiver is in effect only through model \nyear 2025.\u201d  But if petitioners are correct that the chal-\nlenged waiver meaningfully affects their operations \nonly through model-year 2025, then that only further \nconfirms that this Court\u2019s intervention can do little to \nbenefit them.  If this Court granted certiorari on both \nquestions presented and ultimately held that petition-\ners have standing, it likely would not issue a merits de-\ncision until spring or summer of 2025, when model-year \n2026 cars will already be on the road.  See 40 C.F.R. \n85.2304(a) (establishing that the model year may begin \n\u201con January 2 of the calendar year preceding the year \nfor which the model year is designated,\u201d i.e., on January \n2, 2025, for model year 2026); 40 C.F.R. 85.2305(a). \nNor is there any reason to think that the statutory \nissue presented will necessarily evade judicial review.  \nNumerous Section 209(b) waivers have been reviewed \nby courts on the merits.  See, e.g., American Trucking \nAss\u2019ns v. EPA, 600 F.3d 624, 627-629 (D.C. Cir. 2010); \nMotor & Equip. Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. Nichols, 142 F.3d 449, \n462-464 (D.C. Cir. 1998).  Indeed, the precise issue of \nstatutory interpretation that petitioners raise here is \ncurrently pending before the D.C. Circuit in a case aris-\ning from EPA\u2019s 2023 waiver for California\u2019s standards \n\n23 \n \ngoverning heavy-duty vehicles and engines.  See Private \nPet. Br. 39-58, Western States Trucking Assoc., Inc. v. \nEPA, No. 23-1143 (D.C. Cir. Nov. 3, 2023); 88 Fed. Reg. \n20,688, 20,688 (Apr. 6, 2023).  That waiver applies to Cal-\nifornia standards that govern through model-year 2035 \nand beyond, see Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1963.1 (2024), \nso the challenge there will not be affected by any issues \nconcerning the duration of the waiver.2   \nMoreover, the alleged urgency here results in part \nfrom petitioners\u2019 own litigation decisions.  Petitioners \ndid not challenge EPA\u2019s 2013 waiver in 2013, when there \nwas ample time to obtain a judicial decision before \nmodel-year 2025.  Instead, they challenged only EPA\u2019s \n2022 reinstatement of the 2013 waiver, by which time \nmodel-year 2025 was fast approaching.  And once they \nfiled their challenge in the D.C. Circuit, they litigated \non a normal timeline, without seeking expedition.  Peti-\ntioners also suggest (Pet. 35-36) that granting review \nnow is necessary because California has adopted new \nstandards applicable to passenger vehicles for future \nmodel years.  But if EPA grants California a waiver for \nthose new standards\u2014which EPA has not yet done\u2014\npetitioners can challenge the waiver at that time. \n2. a. In any event, petitioners\u2019 statutory argument \nlacks merit.  Section 209(b) provides that EPA gener-\nally \u201cshall\u201d grant California a preemption waiver \u201cif the \nState determines that the State standards will be, in  \nthe aggregate, at least as protective of public health  \nand welfare as applicable Federal standards.\u201d  42 \nU.S.C. 7543(b)(1).  Section 209(b) further specifies, \n \n2 The D.C. Circuit has held Western States Trucking in abeyance \npending the court\u2019s resolution of Texas v. EPA, No. 22-1031 (argued \nSept. 14, 2023).  See Western States Trucking, supra, No. 23-1143 \n(Dec. 21, 2023).      \n\n24 \n \nhowever, that \u201c[n]o such waiver shall be granted if the \nAdministrator finds that,\u201d inter alia, \u201csuch State does \nnot need such State standards to meet compelling and \nextraordinary conditions.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7543(b)(1)(B).   \nIn its 2022 reinstatement decision, EPA concluded \nthat California\u2019s 2012 waiver request had been properly \ngranted in 2013 pursuant to Section 209(b)\u2019s criteria.  \nSee 87 Fed. Reg. at 14,358-14,361; see also 78 Fed. Reg. \nat 2113.  In reaching that conclusion, EPA affirmed that \nthe 2013 waiver grant had correctly considered Califor-\nnia\u2019s standards in the aggregate, as EPA has consist-\nently done in waiver decisions across the last five dec-\nades.  See 87 Fed. Reg. at 14,353-14,354 (discussing this \ntraditional practice); cf. Motor & Equipment Mfrs. \nAss\u2019n, 142 F.3d at 464 (agreeing with EPA that, for pur-\nposes of Section 209(b)(1)(C), \u201cCalifornia\u2019s consistency \nis to be evaluated \u2018in the aggregate,\u2019 rather than on a \none-to-one basis\u201d) (citation omitted).   \nSection 209(b)(1) requires California to base its pro-\ntectiveness determination on its \u201cstandards  * * *  in  \nthe aggregate.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7543(b)(1).  Subparagraph \n(b)(1)(B)\u2019s directive that EPA must consider whether \n\u201csuch State standards\u201d are needed \u201cto meet compelling \nand extraordinary conditions,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 7543(b)(1)(B) \n(emphasis added), therefore is likewise best understood \nto refer to the standards in the aggregate.  See Slack \nTechs., LLC v. Pirani, 598 U.S. 759, 766 (2023) (\u201cThe \nword \u2018such\u2019 usually refers to something that has already \nbeen \u2018described\u2019 or that is \u2018implied or intelligible from \nthe context or circumstances.\u2019\u200a\u201d) (citation omitted).  Be-\ncause the state standards just mentioned in paragraph \n(b)(1) have an aggregate character, \u201csuch State stand-\nards\u201d in subparagraph (b)(1)(B) have the same aggre-\ngate character.  Although petitioners contend that \n\n25 \n \n\u201cSection 209(b)\u2019s \u2018in the aggregate\u2019 language does not \ncarry down to the rest of 209(b),\u201d Pet. 32 (emphasis \nomitted), petitioners disregard the word \u201csuch,\u201d whose \nusual purpose is to make clear that such a connection \nexists. \nPetitioners further contend (Pet. 32) that EPA\u2019s ag-\ngregate approach to subparagraph (b)(1)(B) is incon-\nsistent with its approach to subparagraph (b)(1)(C).  \nBut petitioners\u2019 premise is wrong:  As EPA explained, \nit interprets subparagraph (b)(1)(C) to also \u201crefer to \nstandards in the aggregate.\u201d  87 Fed. Reg. at 14,361; see \nid. at 14,361 n.266 (explaining that EPA has evaluated \nCalifornia\u2019s \u201csuite of standards\u201d and that \u201cEPA\u2019s as-\nsessment under 209(b)(1)(C) is not in practice a stand-\nard-by-standard review\u201d); Motor & Equip. Mfrs. Ass\u2019n, \n142 F.3d at 464. \nPetitioners also advance a highly restrictive reading \nof other terms in subparagraph (b)(1)(B)\u2014like \u201c\u200a\u2018ex-\ntraordinary\u2019\u200a\u201d and \u201cneed\u201d\u2014contending that the provi-\nsion only permits standards that are \u201cessential\u201d to \nmeeting \u201cCalifornia\u2019s distinctive local pollution prob-\nlems.\u201d  Pet. 28, 31.  But that argument presupposes that \nCalifornia\u2019s standards must be evaluated individually \nrather than in the aggregate.  Petitioners appear to \nacknowledge (Pet. 32) that, if \u201cEPA\u2019s whole-program \napproach\u201d is valid, then subparagraph (b)(1)(B) is satis-\nfied even under their reading of \u201c\u200a\u2018extraordinary\u2019\u200a\u201d and \n\u201c\u200a\u2018need[].\u2019\u200a\u201d \nb. Section 209(b)\u2019s history reinforces EPA\u2019s aggre-\ngate approach.  As noted above, see p. 3, supra, the 1967 \nversion of the CAA required California\u2019s standards to \nbe \u201cmore stringent than applicable Federal standards.\u201d  \n\u00a7 208(b), 81 Stat. 501.  As amended in 1977, however, the \nstatute requires California to determine only that its \n\n26 \n \nstandards \u201cin the aggregate\u201d will be at least as protec-\ntive as federal standards.  \u00a7\u202f207, 91 Stat. 755.  That 1977 \namendment ensured that California had flexibility to \nadopt an appropriate program of \u201cemission control \nstandards,\u201d \u201ceven if those standards were in some re-\nspects less stringent than comparable federal ones.\u201d  \nMotor & Equip. Mfrs. Ass\u2019n, 142 F.3d at 464 (citation \nomitted).  As EPA recognized 40 years ago, Congress \nwould \u201cnot have given this flexibility to California and \nsimultaneously assigned to the state the seemingly im-\npossible task of establishing that \u2018extraordinary and \ncompelling conditions\u2019 exist for each less stringent \nstandard.\u201d  49 Fed. Reg. 18,887, 18,890 n.24 (May 3, \n1984). \nc. Petitioners\u2019 reliance (Pet. 33) on various \u201cclear-\nstatement rules\u201d is misplaced.  As the government\u2019s \nbrief in opposition in Ohio v. EPA, petition for cert. \npending, 24-13 (filed July 5, 2024), explains, Section \n209(b) raises no serious issue under the equal-sover-\neignty principle.  And because the petitioners in Ohio v. \nEPA argue that Congress is categorically foreclosed \nfrom subjecting different States\u2019 laws to different \npreemption standards, their approach would render \nSection 209(b) unconstitutional under either a whole-\nprogram or a standard-by-standard interpretation.  The \nconstitutional-avoidance canon therefore has no evident \nrole to play here. \nThe major-questions doctrine is likewise inapplica-\nble.  Contrary to petitioners\u2019 implication (Pet. 34), eco-\nnomic consequences standing alone have never been \nenough to trigger the major-questions doctrine.  After \nall, the doctrine is a tool for discerning \u201cthe text\u2019s most \nnatural interpretation\u201d by situating the text in \u201ccon-\ntext.\u201d  Biden v. Nebraska, 600 U.S. 477, 508 (2023) \n\n27 \n \n(Barrett, J., concurring).  So in deciding whether the \ndoctrine applies, this Court has considered not just the \n\u201ceconomic and political significance\u201d of the asserted au-\nthority, but also other surrounding circumstances, such \nas the \u201chistory and the breadth of th[at] authority.\u201d  \nWest Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, 721 (2022) (citation \nomitted); see, e.g., Nebraska, 600 U.S. at 501 (same). \nHere, neither the history nor the breadth of the pro-\nvision at issue \u201cprovide[s] a \u2018reason to hesitate.\u2019\u200a\u201d  West \nVirginia, 597 U.S. at 721 (citation omitted).  Indeed, un-\nlike the federal statutory provisions at issue in West \nVirginia and Nebraska, the waiver provision does not \n\u201cconfer[] authority upon an administrative agency\u201d to \nmake \u201c\u200a\u2018major policy decisions.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at 721, 723 (citation \nomitted).  Rather, it requires EPA to adjudicate waiver \nrequests and confines EPA\u2019s discretion to determining \nwhether specified criteria are met.  And while the  \nmajor-questions doctrine is designed in part to \u201cpre-\nserve room for lawmaking\u201d by state and local govern-\nments, id. at 739 (Gorsuch, J., concurring), restricting \nthe availability of Section 209(b) waivers (as petitioners \nrequest) would curb state power and expand federal \npower.  \nPetitioners\u2019 invocation (Pet. 34) of the federalism \ncanon is even further afield.  Petitioners contend (Pet. \n34) that, \u201cunder EPA\u2019s view, California alone among the \nStates can regulate the nation\u2019s automobile market in \nthe service of addressing climate change and forcing a \ntransition to electric vehicles.\u201d  Petitioners\u2019 proposed \nconstruction of Section 209(b), however, would not ex-\npand state regulatory authority in this sphere.  To the \ncontrary, adopting that interpretation would make it \nmore difficult for California to obtain preemption waiv-\ners, and it would correspondingly reduce other States\u2019 \n\n28 \n \npractical ability to choose between California and fed-\neral vehicle-emission standards.  Petitioners\u2019 invocation \nof the federalism canon as a ground for constraining \nstate regulatory authority would thus flip the canon on \nits head.  \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nELIZABETH B.

Circuit's decision hinged on redressability, specifically the idea that market forces and independent actions by third-party automakers would continue the trend toward EVs regardless of the EPA waiver. This search query directly targets the petitioners' counter-arguments on this exact point within the most crucial document\u2014the cert petition. Understanding how the petitioners frame their argument\u2014that a favorable ruling would indeed redress their injury despite these other factors\u2014is essential to predicting whether the Supreme Court will find they have standing. Therefore, the Task EIG is very high.\n\nFor Design EIG, this action exemplifies a sophisticated and effective legal reasoning strategy. It involves identifying the dispositive legal issue from the lower court's opinion (redressability), breaking it down into its constituent factual predicates ('market forces', 'third parties'), and then crafting a precise query to find the direct rebuttal in the key appellate document. This is a powerful, generalizable methodology for analyzing any case on appeal, making the Design EIG high as well.",

ARFFA \nSULLIVAN & CROMWELL LLP \n125 Broad Street  \nNew York, NY 10004 \n \n \n(Additional counsel on signature page) \n\n \n(I) \nQUESTIONS PRESENTED \nSection 209(a) of the Clean Air Act generally \npreempts States from adopting emission standards for \nnew motor vehicles.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(a).  But under \nSection 209(b) of that Act, EPA may grant California\u2014\nand only California\u2014a waiver from federal preemption \nto set its own vehicle-emission standards.  Before \ngranting a preemption waiver, EPA must find that Cal-\nifornia \u201cneed[s]\u201d its own emission standards \u201cto meet \ncompelling and extraordinary conditions.\u201d  \nId. \n\u00a7 7543(b)(1)(B).   \nIn 2022, EPA granted California a waiver to set its \nown standards for greenhouse-gas emissions and to \nadopt a zero-emission-vehicle mandate, both expressly \nintended to address global climate change by reducing \nCalifornia vehicles\u2019 consumption of liquid fuel.  Fuel \nproducers challenged EPA\u2019s waiver as contrary to the \ntext of Section 209(b).  The D.C. Circuit rejected the \nchallenge without reaching the merits, concluding that \nfuel producers\u2019 injuries were not redressable because \nthey had not established that vacating EPA\u2019s waiver \nwould have any effect on automakers.   \nThe questions presented are: \n1.  Whether a party may establish the redressability \ncomponent of Article III standing by relying on the  \ncoercive and predictable effects of regulation on third \nparties. \n2.  Whether EPA\u2019s preemption waiver for Califor-\nnia\u2019s greenhouse-gas emission standards and zero-\nemission-vehicle mandate is unlawful. \n\n \n(II) \n \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nPetitioners are Diamond Alternative Energy, LLC, \nAmerican Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, Clean \nFuels Development Coalition, Diamond Alternative \nEnergy, LLC, Domestic Energy Producers Alliance, \nEnergy Marketers of America, ICM, Inc., Illinois Corn \nGrowers Association, Iowa Soybean Association, Kan-\nsas Corn Growers Association, Michigan Corn Growers \nAssociation, Minnesota Soybean Growers Association, \nMissouri Corn Growers Association, National Associa-\ntion of Convenience Stores, South Dakota Soybean As-\nsociation, and Valero Renewable Fuels Company, \nLLC. \nRespondents are the Environmental Protection \nAgency and Michael S.

It starts off modestly enough:  because both \nmotor vehicles and air pollution often cross state bor-\nders, Section 209(a) entrusts EPA to enact nationwide \nvehicle-emission standards and preempts States from \nadopting their own.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(a); see id. \u00a7 7410.  \nBut then Section 209(b) does something unusual:  it  \nallows EPA to grant a waiver from preemption to a  \nsingle State\u2014California\u2014to enforce its own vehicle- \nemission standards.  To escape preemption, California \nmust demonstrate to EPA that it \u201cneed[s]\u201d its own \nemission standards \u201cto meet compelling and extraordi-\nnary conditions.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7543(b)(1)(B).  Other States \n\n2 \n \n \nmay not establish their own standards, but they may \nelect to follow EPA\u2019s or California\u2019s. \nAs a concurrent challenge of 17 States explains, \nthere are serious constitutional concerns with a statute \nthat allows only California to act as a junior-varsity \nEPA.  Still, for its first several decades, Section 209 \nworked more or less as intended.  EPA granted \npreemption waivers for California to tackle local prob-\nlems like smog in the Los Angeles basin, where the pol-\nlution was both generated by and felt by Californians.  \nBut all sensibility stopped in 2009, when California be-\ngan claiming that Section 209 authorized it to set stand-\nards to curb greenhouse gases in an effort to tackle \nglobal climate change.  For the next decade, EPA flip-\nflopped under each new Presidential Administration \nabout whether it could grant California such a waiver.  \nIn this latest order, EPA has again taken the position \nthat Section 209 permits California to operate as a \nquasi-federal regulator on global climate change.   \nThat vaunted role cannot be squared with the text, \nstructure, or purpose of Section 209.  First, climate \nchange is not an \u201cextraordinary\u201d condition within Cal-\nifornia, and thus within the meaning of Section \n209(b)(1)(B), because it is a global issue that is not lo-\ncalized to California.  Second, California does not \n\u201cneed\u201d its own emission standards to \u201cmeet\u201d global  \nclimate-change conditions, as its standards would have \nno discernable effect on climate-change-related condi-\ntions in the State (or anywhere else).  Global climate \nchange is, in short, not the kind of California-specific \ncondition that Section 209(b) carves out from preemp-\ntion. \nThe question whether California may set green-\nhouse-gas emission standards for itself and other \n\n3 \n \n \nStates is undeniably major.  California has mandated \n100% electric vehicles by 2036, and is forcing electrifi-\ncation of the country\u2019s vehicle fleet.  And the Executive \nBranch intends exactly that.  The National Highway \nTraffic Safety Administration and EPA have set their \nown fuel-economy and emission standards that impose \nde facto electric-vehicle mandates in violation of their \ngoverning statutes.  The companion challenges to those \nrules are awaiting decision by the D.C. Circuit.  See \nTexas v. EPA, No. 22-1031 (filed Feb. 28, 2022); Natu-\nral Res. Def. Council v. NHTSA, No. 22-1080 (filed \nMay 11, 2022).  But by granting California the author-\nity to outstrip even those mandates, EPA has put in \nplace a backstop to the unlawful federal rules.  Simply \nput, the waiver and authority claimed here are key \nparts of a coordinated agency strategy to convert the \nNation from liquid-fuel-powered vehicles to electric ve-\nhicles.  If that strategy seems familiar, it should.  See \nWest Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697 (2022). \nDespite the issue\u2019s importance, the D.C. Circuit has \navoided the merits of EPA\u2019s interpretation for over 15 \nyears.  It has met each challenge to EPA\u2019s waiver de-\ntermination with a different jurisdictional barrier.  \nThis time, the D.C. Circuit dodged the issue under the \nguise of redressability.  Petitioners are entities and as-\nsociations of entities that produce or sell liquid fuels \nand the raw materials used to make them.  Facing a \nregulation designed to reduce the demand for their \nproducts, petitioners\u2019 standing is self-evident.  They \nalso introduced unrebutted standing declarations \nabout how California\u2019s standards will increase the sales \nof electric vehicles and reduce the consumption of liq-\nuid fuel\u2014which, after all, is their express purpose.  See \nApp., infra, 19a-20a.  But in a per curiam opinion, the \n\n4 \n \n \nD.C. Circuit held that petitioners had not established \nredressability because they had not submitted evi-\ndence, such as affidavits from third-party automakers, \nshowing precisely how automakers would adjust their \nproduction or prices during the four years of the \nwaiver.  Id. at 30a.  \nThe D.C. Circuit\u2019s standing decision is wrong and \nwarrants this Court\u2019s review.  Under precedents of this \nCourt and even the D.C. Circuit, \u201cremov[ing] a regula-\ntory hurdle\u201d to the sale of a challenger\u2019s product suf-\nfices to establish redressability.  Energy Future Coa-\nlition v. EPA, 793 F.3d 141, 144 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (Ka-\nvanaugh, J.); see Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 169 \n(1997).  At a minimum, challengers to governmental ac-\ntion can rely on the \u201cpredictable effect\u201d of regulation \non third parties to establish causation and redressabil-\nity.  Department of Commerce v. New York, 588 U.S. \n752, 768 (2019).  Where, as here, the entire point of the \nchallenged regulation is to reduce consumption of the \nplaintiffs\u2019 products, a decision vacating the regulation \nwould obviously provide redress.  Other courts of ap-\npeals applying these principles have thus found stand-\ning without relying on the sort of affidavits that the \ncourt below demanded.  Left uncorrected, the decision \nbelow will impose an often insurmountable barrier to \nchallenges in the court of appeals that is the primary \nhome for administrative litigation.   \nThis Court should also reach the merits of petition-\ners\u2019 challenge, and finally decide whether EPA has the \nauthority to grant California a preemption waiver to \naddress global climate change.  The challenged Califor-\nnia standards are in effect only through model year \n2025, so merely correcting the D.C. Circuit\u2019s standing \nmistake may mean that no court considers the merits \n\n5 \n \n \nbefore the waiver expires.  And granting review of both \nquestions presented is also the most reasonable way to \nresolve the States\u2019 concurrent challenge to the decision \nbelow.  The States challenged EPA\u2019s waiver as uncon-\nstitutional because Section 209(b) violates the principle \nof equal sovereignty, and the court below rejected that \nconstitutional argument on the merits.  App., infra, \n49a.  Granting review of the merits would allow the \nCourt to consider whether EPA\u2019s waiver is statutorily \nauthorized before needing to reach the States\u2019 consti-\ntutional questions, raised in a separate petition.  The \nCourt should grant both this petition and the States\u2019, \nand reverse. \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe opinion of the court of appeals (App., infra, \n1a-49a) is reported at 98 F.4th 288.  The EPA order \nunder review (App., infra, 50a-285a) is available at \n87 Fed. Reg. 14,332. \nJURISDICTION \nThe court of appeals entered judgment on April 9, \n2024.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nRelevant statutory provisions are reproduced in the \nappendix to this petition.  App., infra, 286a-290a. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Legal Background \nTitle II of the Clean Air Act makes EPA the Na-\ntion\u2019s primary regulator of motor-vehicle emissions.  \n\n6 \n \n \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7410.  To effectuate a (mostly) uniform fed-\neral emissions regime, Section 209(a) of the Act prohib-\nits States from \u201cadopt[ing] or attempt[ing] to enforce \nany standard relating to the control of emissions from \nnew motor vehicles.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7543(a).  This preemption \nprovision prevents \u201can anarchic patchwork of federal \nand state regulatory programs.\u201d  Motor & Equip. \nMfrs. Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 627 F.2d 1095, 1109 (D.C. Cir. \n1979). \nCongress allowed only one exception to Section \n209(a)\u2019s broad preemption provision:  Section 209(b), \nwhich authorizes EPA to \u201cwaive\u201d preemption for Cali-\nfornia, under limited circumstances.  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7543(b).

But under \nSection 209(b) of that Act, EPA may grant California\u2014\nand only California\u2014a waiver from federal preemption \nto set its own vehicle-emission standards.  Before \ngranting a preemption waiver, EPA must find that Cal-\nifornia \u201cneed[s]\u201d its own emission standards \u201cto meet \ncompelling and extraordinary conditions.\u201d  \nId. \n\u00a7 7543(b)(1)(B).   \nIn 2022, EPA granted California a waiver to set its \nown standards for greenhouse-gas emissions and to \nadopt a zero-emission-vehicle mandate, both expressly \nintended to address global climate change by reducing \nCalifornia vehicles\u2019 consumption of liquid fuel.  Fuel \nproducers challenged EPA\u2019s waiver as contrary to the \ntext of Section 209(b).  The D.C. Circuit rejected the \nchallenge without reaching the merits, concluding that \nfuel producers\u2019 injuries were not redressable because \nthey had not established that vacating EPA\u2019s waiver \nwould have any effect on automakers.   \nThe questions presented are: \n1.  Whether a party may establish the redressability \ncomponent of Article III standing by relying on the  \ncoercive and predictable effects of regulation on third \nparties. \n2.  Whether EPA\u2019s preemption waiver for Califor-\nnia\u2019s greenhouse-gas emission standards and zero-\nemission-vehicle mandate is unlawful. \n\n \n(II) \n \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nPetitioners are Diamond Alternative Energy, LLC, \nAmerican Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, Clean \nFuels Development Coalition, Diamond Alternative \nEnergy, LLC, Domestic Energy Producers Alliance, \nEnergy Marketers of America, ICM, Inc., Illinois Corn \nGrowers Association, Iowa Soybean Association, Kan-\nsas Corn Growers Association, Michigan Corn Growers \nAssociation, Minnesota Soybean Growers Association, \nMissouri Corn Growers Association, National Associa-\ntion of Convenience Stores, South Dakota Soybean As-\nsociation, and Valero Renewable Fuels Company, \nLLC. \nRespondents are the Environmental Protection \nAgency and Michael S.

It starts off modestly enough:  because both \nmotor vehicles and air pollution often cross state bor-\nders, Section 209(a) entrusts EPA to enact nationwide \nvehicle-emission standards and preempts States from \nadopting their own.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(a); see id. \u00a7 7410.  \nBut then Section 209(b) does something unusual:  it  \nallows EPA to grant a waiver from preemption to a  \nsingle State\u2014California\u2014to enforce its own vehicle- \nemission standards.  To escape preemption, California \nmust demonstrate to EPA that it \u201cneed[s]\u201d its own \nemission standards \u201cto meet compelling and extraordi-\nnary conditions.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7543(b)(1)(B).  Other States \n\n2 \n \n \nmay not establish their own standards, but they may \nelect to follow EPA\u2019s or California\u2019s. \nAs a concurrent challenge of 17 States explains, \nthere are serious constitutional concerns with a statute \nthat allows only California to act as a junior-varsity \nEPA.  Still, for its first several decades, Section 209 \nworked more or less as intended.  EPA granted \npreemption waivers for California to tackle local prob-\nlems like smog in the Los Angeles basin, where the pol-\nlution was both generated by and felt by Californians.  \nBut all sensibility stopped in 2009, when California be-\ngan claiming that Section 209 authorized it to set stand-\nards to curb greenhouse gases in an effort to tackle \nglobal climate change.  For the next decade, EPA flip-\nflopped under each new Presidential Administration \nabout whether it could grant California such a waiver.  \nIn this latest order, EPA has again taken the position \nthat Section 209 permits California to operate as a \nquasi-federal regulator on global climate change.   \nThat vaunted role cannot be squared with the text, \nstructure, or purpose of Section 209.  First, climate \nchange is not an \u201cextraordinary\u201d condition within Cal-\nifornia, and thus within the meaning of Section \n209(b)(1)(B), because it is a global issue that is not lo-\ncalized to California.  Second, California does not \n\u201cneed\u201d its own emission standards to \u201cmeet\u201d global  \nclimate-change conditions, as its standards would have \nno discernable effect on climate-change-related condi-\ntions in the State (or anywhere else).  Global climate \nchange is, in short, not the kind of California-specific \ncondition that Section 209(b) carves out from preemp-\ntion. \nThe question whether California may set green-\nhouse-gas emission standards for itself and other \n\n3 \n \n \nStates is undeniably major.  California has mandated \n100% electric vehicles by 2036, and is forcing electrifi-\ncation of the country\u2019s vehicle fleet.  And the Executive \nBranch intends exactly that.  The National Highway \nTraffic Safety Administration and EPA have set their \nown fuel-economy and emission standards that impose \nde facto electric-vehicle mandates in violation of their \ngoverning statutes.  The companion challenges to those \nrules are awaiting decision by the D.C. Circuit.  See \nTexas v. EPA, No. 22-1031 (filed Feb. 28, 2022); Natu-\nral Res. Def. Council v. NHTSA, No. 22-1080 (filed \nMay 11, 2022).  But by granting California the author-\nity to outstrip even those mandates, EPA has put in \nplace a backstop to the unlawful federal rules.  Simply \nput, the waiver and authority claimed here are key \nparts of a coordinated agency strategy to convert the \nNation from liquid-fuel-powered vehicles to electric ve-\nhicles.  If that strategy seems familiar, it should.  See \nWest Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697 (2022). \nDespite the issue\u2019s importance, the D.C. Circuit has \navoided the merits of EPA\u2019s interpretation for over 15 \nyears.  It has met each challenge to EPA\u2019s waiver de-\ntermination with a different jurisdictional barrier.  \nThis time, the D.C. Circuit dodged the issue under the \nguise of redressability.  Petitioners are entities and as-\nsociations of entities that produce or sell liquid fuels \nand the raw materials used to make them.  Facing a \nregulation designed to reduce the demand for their \nproducts, petitioners\u2019 standing is self-evident.  They \nalso introduced unrebutted standing declarations \nabout how California\u2019s standards will increase the sales \nof electric vehicles and reduce the consumption of liq-\nuid fuel\u2014which, after all, is their express purpose.  See \nApp., infra, 19a-20a.  But in a per curiam opinion, the \n\n4 \n \n \nD.C. Circuit held that petitioners had not established \nredressability because they had not submitted evi-\ndence, such as affidavits from third-party automakers, \nshowing precisely how automakers would adjust their \nproduction or prices during the four years of the \nwaiver.  Id. at 30a.  \nThe D.C. Circuit\u2019s standing decision is wrong and \nwarrants this Court\u2019s review.  Under precedents of this \nCourt and even the D.C. Circuit, \u201cremov[ing] a regula-\ntory hurdle\u201d to the sale of a challenger\u2019s product suf-\nfices to establish redressability.  Energy Future Coa-\nlition v. EPA, 793 F.3d 141, 144 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (Ka-\nvanaugh, J.); see Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 169 \n(1997).  At a minimum, challengers to governmental ac-\ntion can rely on the \u201cpredictable effect\u201d of regulation \non third parties to establish causation and redressabil-\nity.  Department of Commerce v. New York, 588 U.S. \n752, 768 (2019).  Where, as here, the entire point of the \nchallenged regulation is to reduce consumption of the \nplaintiffs\u2019 products, a decision vacating the regulation \nwould obviously provide redress.  Other courts of ap-\npeals applying these principles have thus found stand-\ning without relying on the sort of affidavits that the \ncourt below demanded.  Left uncorrected, the decision \nbelow will impose an often insurmountable barrier to \nchallenges in the court of appeals that is the primary \nhome for administrative litigation.   \nThis Court should also reach the merits of petition-\ners\u2019 challenge, and finally decide whether EPA has the \nauthority to grant California a preemption waiver to \naddress global climate change.  The challenged Califor-\nnia standards are in effect only through model year \n2025, so merely correcting the D.C. Circuit\u2019s standing \nmistake may mean that no court considers the merits \n\n5 \n \n \nbefore the waiver expires.  And granting review of both \nquestions presented is also the most reasonable way to \nresolve the States\u2019 concurrent challenge to the decision \nbelow.  The States challenged EPA\u2019s waiver as uncon-\nstitutional because Section 209(b) violates the principle \nof equal sovereignty, and the court below rejected that \nconstitutional argument on the merits.  App., infra, \n49a.  Granting review of the merits would allow the \nCourt to consider whether EPA\u2019s waiver is statutorily \nauthorized before needing to reach the States\u2019 consti-\ntutional questions, raised in a separate petition.  The \nCourt should grant both this petition and the States\u2019, \nand reverse. \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe opinion of the court of appeals (App., infra, \n1a-49a) is reported at 98 F.4th 288.  The EPA order \nunder review (App., infra, 50a-285a) is available at \n87 Fed. Reg. 14,332. \nJURISDICTION \nThe court of appeals entered judgment on April 9, \n2024.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nRelevant statutory provisions are reproduced in the \nappendix to this petition.  App., infra, 286a-290a. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Legal Background \nTitle II of the Clean Air Act makes EPA the Na-\ntion\u2019s primary regulator of motor-vehicle emissions.  \n\n6 \n \n \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7410.  To effectuate a (mostly) uniform fed-\neral emissions regime, Section 209(a) of the Act prohib-\nits States from \u201cadopt[ing] or attempt[ing] to enforce \nany standard relating to the control of emissions from \nnew motor vehicles.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7543(a).  This preemption \nprovision prevents \u201can anarchic patchwork of federal \nand state regulatory programs.\u201d  Motor & Equip. \nMfrs. Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 627 F.2d 1095, 1109 (D.C. Cir. \n1979). \nCongress allowed only one exception to Section \n209(a)\u2019s broad preemption provision:  Section 209(b), \nwhich authorizes EPA to \u201cwaive\u201d preemption for Cali-\nfornia, under limited circumstances.  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7543(b).  Congress granted California this special \nstatus because of the State\u2019s \u201cunique problems\u201d with \nsmog and other local issues caused by criteria pollu-\ntants like ozone and particulate matter.  H.R. Rep. No. \n90-728, at 22 (1967).  California\u2019s atypical \u201cgeography \nand prevailing wind patterns,\u201d together with its unusu-\nally large number of vehicles, made smog a more per-\nsistent problem there than elsewhere.  49 Fed. Reg. \n18,887, 18,890 (May 3, 1984) (citing 113 Cong. Rec. \n30,948 (Nov. 2, 1967)).   \nCongress limited California\u2019s ability to separately \nregulate emissions in several ways.  California may ap-\nply for a waiver only if it \u201cdetermines that [its own] \nState standards will be, in the aggregate, at least as \nprotective of public health and welfare as applicable \nFederal standards.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(b)(1).  EPA must \nthen evaluate the application and deny a waiver if, \namong other things, it finds that California\u2019s protec-\ntiveness determination is \u201carbitrary and capricious,\u201d \nid. \u00a7 7543(b)(1)(A); or if California \u201cdoes not need such \n\n7 \n \n \nState standards to meet compelling and extraordinary \nconditions,\u201d id. \u00a7 7543(b)(1)(B). \nIn 1977, Congress amended the Clean Air Act to al-\nlow any other State to \u201cadopt and enforce\u201d California \nstandards \u201cfor which a waiver has been granted,\u201d so \nlong as the State has a federally approved plan to at-\ntain the air-quality standards EPA sets for criteria pol-\nlutants.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7507, 7408(a), 7409.  The upshot \nof this unusual preemption system is that EPA sets na-\ntionwide emission standards; California may in limited \ncircumstances set more stringent ones in California; \nand other States may either apply EPA\u2019s standards or \nadopt California\u2019s, but may not set their own. \nB. Regulatory Background \n1. For decades, California used its waiver author-\nity as Congress intended, to set emission standards to \ncombat local air-quality problems like smog.  See, e.g., \n38 Fed. Reg. 10,235, 10,318 (Apr. 26, 1973); 59 Fed. \nReg. 48,557, 48,626 (Sept. 22, 1994).  In recent years, \nhowever, California has sought to transform this ex-\nception for tackling localized pollution into a tool for \naddressing global climate change through forced elec-\ntrification of its vehicle fleet.   \nThat effort initially failed.  In 2008, EPA denied Cal-\nifornia\u2019s first application for a waiver allowing it to set \nemission standards to address climate change.  EPA \ndetermined that Section 209(b)\u2019s preemption waiver \npermitted California to enact standards only to ad-\ndress \u201clocal and regional\u201d pollution where the \u201ccausal \nfactors are local to California\u201d\u2014which obviously did \nnot include global climate change.  73 Fed. Reg. 12,156, \n12,163 (Mar. 6, 2008).  \n\n8 \n \n \nThe day after President Obama took office, Califor-\nnia sought reconsideration of EPA\u2019s denial of its waiver \napplication for greenhouse-gas standards.  EPA \ngranted reconsideration, reversed itself, and issued the \nwaiver.  74 Fed. Reg. 32,755, 32,783 (July 8, 2009).  A \nnumber of affected parties challenged EPA\u2019s decision, \nbut the D.C. Circuit held that the case was moot be-\ncause California had \u201cdeemed\u201d compliance with federal \nstandards to satisfy the State\u2019s standards as well.  \nChamber of Commerce v. EPA, 642 F.3d 192, 206 (D.C. \nCir. 2011).   \n2.  In 2012, California applied for a new waiver to \nallow it to impose even more standards aimed at curb-\ning greenhouse-gas emissions.  This case concerns that \n2012 waiver application and the \u201cAdvanced Clean Car\u201d \nstandards that it imposes.  Those standards govern all \nnew passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and medium-\nduty vehicles sold in California for model years 2015 \nthrough 2025. \nAs relevant here, the Advanced Clean Car stand-\nards have two key features that require a preemption \nwaiver.  First, California\u2019s greenhouse-gas emission \nstandards limit carbon-dioxide emissions and thus ef-\nfectively force manufacturers to produce and sell fewer \ncars that run on liquid fuel.  78 Fed. Reg. 2,112, 2,137 \n(Jan. 9, 2013).  Second, the California standards include \na \u201czero-emission vehicle\u201d mandate, which requires \neach car manufacturer to produce and deliver for sale \nan increasing percentage of electric or fuel-cell vehi-\ncles (or purchase regulatory \u201ccredits\u201d instead).  Cal. \nRegs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(b).  By model year 2025, the re-\nquired percentage of zero-emission vehicles will rise to \naround 22%.  Ibid.  California explained that the man-\ndated zero-emission vehicles \u201ccan dramatically reduce \n\n9 \n \n \npetroleum consumption . . . compared to conventional \ntechnologies.\u201d  Advanced Clean Cars Waiver Request \n7-9 (May 2012), https://www.regulations.gov/docu-\nment/EPA-HQ-OAR-2021-0257-0006.   \n3. In 2013, EPA granted a waiver for California\u2019s \nAdvanced Clean Cars program.  EPA concluded that \nCalifornia\u2019s standards met Section 209(b)\u2019s criteria\u2014\nincluding that they were \u201cneeded to meet compelling \nand extraordinary conditions\u201d\u2014because the threat of \nglobal climate change was itself \u201ccompelling.\u201d  78 Fed. \nReg. at 2,130.  Notably, EPA credited California\u2019s find-\ning that the cost of its regulations would be \u201cmore than \noffset by consumer fuel savings over the life of the ve-\nhicles.\u201d  78 Fed. Reg. at 2,138.  At the time, however, \nCalifornia had kept in place its \u201cdeemed to comply\u201d \nprovision, and so potential challengers were stuck with \nthe unfavorable D.C. Circuit standing precedent.  Cal-\nifornia maintained that provision until 2018, when EPA \nset less stringent standards during the Trump Admin-\nistration. \n4. After that change in Administration, EPA re-\nverted to its original approach to Section 209.  In a 2019 \njoint rulemaking with NHTSA, EPA rescinded the \n2013 preemption waiver for California\u2019s greenhouse-\ngas standards and zero-emission-vehicle mandate, \nagain reasoning that climate change is not the kind of \n\u201cpeculiar,\u201d California-specific condition covered by \nSection 209(b).  84 Fed. Reg. 51,310, 51,328, 51,339 \n(Sept. 27, 2019).  In addition, EPA found that Califor-\nnia did not \u201cneed\u201d its standards to \u201cmeet\u201d climate-\nchange conditions because California\u2019s standards \nwould likely result in \u201cno change in temperatures or \nphysical impacts resulting from anthropogenic climate \nchange in California.\u201d  Id. at 51,341 (emphasis added).  \n\n10 \n \n \nC. Proceedings Below \n1. On his first day in office, President Biden signed \nExecutive Order 13,990, directing EPA to consider \n\u201csuspending, revising, or rescinding\u201d the 2019 with-\ndrawal of California\u2019s 2013 waiver.  86 Fed. Reg. 7,037 \n(Jan. 25, 2021).  EPA dutifully followed the President\u2019s \nlead and reinstated California\u2019s waiver.  App., infra, \n57a.   \nIn granting the waiver, EPA flipped back to its 2013 \nunderstanding of Section 209(b).  It concluded that the \nwaiver was justified in part because California needs \nits emission program as a whole\u2014not the particular \nAdvanced Clean Cars program that was the subject of \nthe waiver\u2014to address its criteria-pollution problems.  \nId. at 158a-166a.  EPA also found that California \nneeded its emission standards and zero-emission vehi-\ncle mandate because the effects of global climate \nchange in California are \u201cextreme,\u201d and because there \nis a \u201clogical link\u201d between local air-pollution problems \nand greenhouse-gas emissions.  Id. at 207a, 215a.   \nTo date, 17 States and the District of Columbia have \nadopted California\u2019s greenhouse-gas standards, its \nzero-emission-vehicle mandate, or both.  CARB, States \nthat Have Adopted California\u2019s Vehicle Regulations \n(June 2024), https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/ \nadvanced-clean-cars-program/states-have-adopted-\ncalifornias-vehicle-regulations.  Together with Califor-\nnia, those jurisdictions account for more than 40% of \nthe Nation\u2019s new vehicle market.  87 Fed. Reg. 14,332, \n14,358 (Mar. 14, 2022). \n2. Petitioners are entities that produce or sell liquid \nfuels and the raw materials used to produce them, \nalong with associations whose members include such \nentities.  They challenged EPA\u2019s waiver reinstatement \n\n11 \n \n \nin the D.C. Circuit.  App., infra, 2a.  Petitioners filed \ndetailed standing declarations, explaining that the re-\ninstatement of California\u2019s standards would depress \ndemand for fuel, injuring them financially.  Id. at 19a-\n20a.  The State of Ohio, along with a coalition of 16 \nother States, separately challenged the reinstatement \non the ground that California\u2019s unique exemption from \nnationwide preemption violates the constitutional \nequal-sovereignty principle.   \nIn defending the waiver reinstatement, EPA did not \ncontest petitioners\u2019 Article III standing.  On the mer-\nits, it primarily relied on what it refers to as its \u201cwhole \nprogram\u201d approach.  Under this reading of the Clean \nAir Act, Section 209(b)(1)(B) is satisfied if \u201cCalifornia \nneeds its program as a whole to meet compelling and \nextraordinary conditions.\u201d  C.A. EPA Br. 84 (emphasis \nadded).  In other words, EPA argued that California \ncan tack on any emission standards it likes to its emis-\nsions \u201cprogram,\u201d \u201cso long as\u201d the State\u2019s criteria- \npollutant problems \u201cpersist.\u201d  Id. at 66.   \nUnlike EPA, California and other state and local in-\ntervenors challenged petitioners\u2019 standing.  They con-\ntended that automakers were independently increas-\ning electric-vehicle production in response to consumer \ndemand, and that petitioners had not \u201cestablished any \nprobability that manufacturers would change course if \nEPA\u2019s decision were vacated.\u201d  C.A. California \nBr. 13-15.  But their own intervention motion attached \ndeclarations asserting that \u201cadditional gasoline-fueled \nvehicles would be sold during these model years\u201d if \nEPA\u2019s waiver were overturned. C.A. States\u2019 Int. Mot., \nScheehle Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 17-18.  In reply, petitioners further \nexplained that they had standing because vacating the \nwaiver would remove a \u201cdirect regulatory impediment\u201d \n\n12 \n \n \nto their products\u2019 use.  C.A. Reply 4 (citing Energy Fu-\nture Coal., 793 F.3d at 144).  They also noted that Cal-\nifornia itself had told EPA that the waiver was \u201ccritical \nfor incentivizing production and deployment of zero-\nemission vehicles.\u201d  Id. (quoting C.A. J.A. 237). \nAt oral argument, however, counsel for the state \nand local intervenors began making similar arguments \nunder the rubric of mootness.  California contended \nthat automakers could no longer change their produc-\ntion and sales plans for vehicles covered by California\u2019s \nwaiver\u2014that is, through model year 2025.  In response, \npetitioners moved to file a supplemental brief explain-\ning why their petitions were not moot, along with sup-\nplemental declarations from individuals experienced in \nvehicle-emissions compliance, who explained that \u201cau-\ntomobile manufacturers could and likely would change \ntheir production, pricing, and/or distribution plans for \nModel Year 2025 as late as December 2025, but at a \nminimum well into 2025.\u201d  C.A. Pet. Standing Adden-\ndum, Kreucher Decl. \u00b6 5. \n3. The court of appeals held that petitioners lack \nArticle III standing to challenge EPA\u2019s waiver.  App., \ninfra, 30a.  Although the court declined to \u201cdefinitively \ndecide\u201d whether petitioners had established injury and \ncausation, it did not question either showing.  Id. at \n21a.  After all, petitioners had explained that \u201cby re-\nquiring vehicle manufacturers to sell vehicles that use \nless or no liquid fuel, California\u2019s . . . requirements de-\npress the demand for liquid fuel.\u201d  Id. at 19a.   \nInstead, the court of appeals concluded that peti-\ntioners had failed to show that their injuries would be \nredressed if EPA\u2019s decision were set aside.  App., in-\nfra, 30a.  The court reasoned that petitioners\u2019 claims \nwere not \u201cmooted by the passage of time,\u201d but rather \n\n13 \n \n \nthat petitioners had lacked standing from the start.  Id. \nat 25a.  The court faulted petitioners for \u201cfail[ing] to \npoint to any evidence affirmatively demonstrating that \nvacatur of the waiver would be substantially likely to\u201d \nprompt automakers to produce fewer electric vehicles \nor alter their prices so that fewer would be sold.  Id. at \n23a.  According to the court, petitioners had thus failed \nto establish that\u2014even if the waiver had been vacated \nat the moment it was reinstated in 2022\u2014automakers \nwould have changed any production or prices before \nthe end of model year 2025.  Id. at 23a-24a.   \nThe court of appeals also declined to consider peti-\ntioners\u2019 supplemental declarations.  App., infra, 30a.  \nThe court reasoned that there was no \u201cgood cause\u201d to \nsupplement the record because petitioners could not \n\u201chave reasonably believed\u201d that \u201ctheir standing was \n\u2018self-evident\u2019 from the record\u201d when they filed their \nopening brief.  Id. at 31a.   \nFinally, the court of appeals rejected the States\u2019 \nequal-sovereignty argument on the merits.  App., in-\nfra, 49a.  The court concluded that the \u201cfundamental \nprinciple of equal sovereignty\u201d does not operate \u201cas a \nlimit on the Commerce Clause or other Article I pow-\ners.\u201d  Id. at 36a (citation omitted).  \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION  \nWhen petitioners filed suit, EPA\u2019s waiver controlled \nfor the next four years.  As a matter of common sense, \nif that waiver were set aside and California were una-\nble to require automakers to produce electric vehicles \ninstead of liquid-fuel vehicles, automakers would make \nor sell at least one more liquid-fuel vehicle over the \ncourse of those four years.  That is the whole point of \nthis hard-fought litigation:  that the waiver would do \n\n14 \n \n \nsomething to reduce California vehicles\u2019 consumption \nof liquid fuel, which necessarily would shift at least a \ndollar of business away from liquid-fuel sellers.  In-\ndeed, the federal government\u2014never one shy about \nraising standing objections\u2014did not even contest peti-\ntioners\u2019 Article III standing.  Yet the court of appeals \nblinded itself to the obvious, and faulted petitioners for \nfailing to prove by affidavit how third-party automak-\ners would naturally behave. \nThis Court should grant review to ensure that the \ncourt of appeals\u2019 contrived standing decision does not \nimperil future challenges to administrative action.  The \ncourt of appeals\u2019 demand for record evidence of au-\ntomaker behavior cannot be squared with this Court\u2019s \nstanding decisions, and it conflicts with decisions from \nseveral courts of appeals.  Especially concerning, it \nwould chill many legitimate agency rule challenges \nthat hinge on third-party action. \nThis Court should also resolve the merits of peti-\ntioners\u2019 challenge to EPA\u2019s statutory authority, to-\ngether with the States\u2019 constitutional equal-sover-\neignty challenge.  For over a decade, the D.C. Circuit \nhas avoided resolving whether EPA has authority to \ngrant a preemption waiver to allow California to ad-\ndress global climate change.  The court of appeals\u2019 \ndodge of the merits here is just the latest installment.  \nEPA\u2019s (current) position that Congress granted Cali-\nfornia, alone among the States, the ability to set vehi-\ncle-emission standards to combat global climate \nchange is patently wrong, and raises serious constitu-\ntional issues for the reasons discussed in the States\u2019 an-\nticipated petition.  Without this Court\u2019s immediate re-\nview, California\u2019s unlawful standards will continue to \n\n15 \n \n \ndictate the composition of the Nation\u2019s automobile \nmarket.   \nI. THE D.C. CIRCUIT\u2019S STANDING DECISION \nWARRANTS THIS COURT\u2019S REVIEW \nA. The Decision Below Is Wrong \nIn the decision below, the D.C. Circuit erected bar-\nriers to demonstrating redressability that have no ba-\nsis in this Court\u2019s Article III jurisprudence.  These bar-\nriers are especially problematic in cases like this one, \nin which the agency action concerns a question of na-\ntional importance.  Such major questions should not be \nartificially insulated from judicial review. \n1. To demonstrate Article III standing, a plaintiff \nmust show that he suffered a concrete injury, that the \ninjury is fairly traceable to the challenged action, and \nthat his \u201cinjury will be redressed by a favorable deci-\nsion.\u201d  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 \n(1992) (internal quotation marks omitted).  A plaintiff \nseeking to demonstrate redressability does not need to \nestablish that a favorable judicial decision would com-\npletely cure his injury.  Rather, a judicial decision need \nonly \u201ctake steps to slow or reduce\u201d the injury.  Massa-\nchusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 525 (2007).  Thus, when \na plaintiff asserts an economic injury, he satisfies the \nredressability requirement if a favorable decision \nwould put even one dollar back in his pocket.  Uzueg-\nbunam v. Preczewski, 592 U.S. 279, 292 (2021). \nWhen a plaintiff is the direct object of the chal-\nlenged regulation, there is usually little question that a \nfavorable decision from the court would provide re-\ndress.  See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561-562.  The same \nshould be true when a plaintiff alleges an \u201cinjury pro-\n\n16 \n \n \nduced by determinative or coercive effect\u201d of the chal-\nlenged regulation \u201cupon the action of someone else.\u201d  \nBennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 169 (1997).  Thus, as \nthen-Judge Kavanaugh explained, if a plaintiff can \nshow that a favorable decision \u201cwould remove a regu-\nlatory hurdle\u201d to third-party conduct that would bene-\nfit the plaintiff, that is ordinarily \u201cenough to demon-\nstrate redressability.\u201d  Energy Future Coalition, \n793 F.3d at 141; see Corner Post, Inc. v. Board of Gov-\nernors of the Fed. Rsrv. Sys., 603 U.S. __ (2024) (Ka-\nvanaugh, J., concurring) (slip op., at 8) (\u201c[E]ntire clas-\nses of administrative litigation . . . have traditionally \nbeen brought by unregulated parties.\u201d).   \nEven when a plaintiff\u2019s injury arises from \u201cthe un-\nfettered choices made by independent actors,\u201d rather \nthan a rule\u2019s \u201ccoercive or determinative effect,\u201d a plain-\ntiff still may establish standing, as long as he can \u201cad-\nduce facts showing that\u201d the third party will behave in \nsuch a way as to \u201cpermit redressability of injury.\u201d  \nLujan, 504 U.S. at 562.  This Court has explained that \na plaintiff may rely on \u201cthe predictable effect of Gov-\nernment action on the decisions of third parties,\u201d and \nhas not required affidavits detailing how third parties \nwill behave.  Department of Commerce, 588 U.S. at 768 \n(emphasis added).  For example, it is predictable that \ngovernment regulation of one business \u201cmay cause \ndownstream or upstream economic injuries to others in \nthe chain.\u201d  FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, \n602 U.S. __ (2024) (slip op., at 12).  By contrast, stand-\ning may not rest on \u201cspeculation about the decisions of \nindependent actors\u201d when those decisions would be un-\nlawful or irrational.  Department of Commerce,  \n588 U.S. at 768 (internal quotation marks omitted).  \nThus, when a plaintiff\u2019s standing theory relies on \n\n17 \n \n \n\u201ccounterintuitive\u201d assumptions about third-party be-\nhavior, the plaintiff may need to support that theory \nwith \u201cstronger evidence.\u201d  California v. Texas, \n593 U.S. 659, 678 (2021). \nDepartment of Commerce illustrates the difference \nbetween predictable effects (which do not require ro-\nbust record evidence) and counterintuitive effects \n(which do).  There, the plaintiffs challenged the inclu-\nsion of a census question about citizenship, which they \ncontended would injure them by causing third-party \nnoncitizen households to decline to respond to the cen-\nsus.  588 U.S. at 766-767.  This Court concluded that \nthose effects were sufficiently predictable to establish \nthe causation element of standing\u2014which, like the re-\ndressability element, turns on the effect of government \naction (or its removal).  Id. at 768; see Alliance for Hip-\npocratic Medicine, 602 U.S. at __ (slip op., at 8) \n(\u201c[C]ausation and redressability . . . are often flip sides \nof the same coin.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).  \nThe Court did not hold that affidavits from noncitizens \nattesting that they did not plan to participate in the \ncensus were required.  The Court found it sufficient \nthat noncitizen households had responded to the cen-\nsus at lower rates in the past, and credited the plain-\ntiffs\u2019 common-sense prediction that noncitizens would \nrespond at even lower rates if the census asked about \ntheir citizenship.  See 588 U.S. at 768. \nAn effect of agency action is \u201cpredictable,\u201d rather \nthan \u201ccounterintuitive,\u201d when the agency itself intends \nor presupposes that effect.  In Massachusetts, for ex-\nample, this Court relied on EPA\u2019s own statements and \nprograms to find that ordering EPA to set emission \nstandards would redress petitioners\u2019 injuries.  549 U.S. \n\n18 \n \n \nat 526.  The Court observed that EPA promoted volun-\ntary emissions-reductions programs, and \u201cwould pre-\nsumably not bother with such efforts,\u201d unless it \nthought that emissions reductions would have some ef-\nfect on the environment.  Ibid.  In other words, an \nagency\u2019s own assumptions about the design of its rule \nare strong evidence of the rule\u2019s predictable effects. \n2. The decision below departs from this Court\u2019s \nsensible approach to redressability.  First, petitioners\u2019 \ninjury arises from the \u201cdeterminative or coercive ef-\nfect\u201d of California\u2019s standards on third-party automak-\ners.  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 169.  By requiring automak-\ners to produce vehicles that consume less or no liquid \nfuel, California\u2019s standards and EPA\u2019s waiver pose a \nlegal barrier to the use of petitioners\u2019 products that a \nfavorable decision would redress.  Under this Court\u2019s \ncases, no more is needed.  \nBut even if petitioners had to show more, the pre-\ndictable effect of EPA\u2019s waiver on automakers is obvi-\nous:  automakers will make and sell more electric vehi-\ncles to comply with California\u2019s regulations.  Other-\nwise, California and EPA \u201cwould presumably not \nbother with such efforts.\u201d  Massachusetts, 549 U.S. at \n526.  If the regulations go away, then the government \nwill no longer be forcing automakers to sell more elec-\ntric vehicles than they would otherwise produce in re-\nsponse to market forces.  So automakers will make \nmore vehicles that run on liquid fuel, or they will adjust \ntheir prices in response to consumer demand.  That is \nEconomics 101, not a proposition that requires an affi-\ndavit for support. \nThe contrast with this Court\u2019s recent decision in \nMurthy v. Missouri, 603 U.S. __ (2024), further illus-\n\n19 \n \n \ntrates the point.  Murthy involved several circum-\nstances that may call redressability into question\u2014\nnone of which is present here.  First, Murthy did not \ninvolve direct government regulation.  Here, whatever \nindependent incentives automakers may have to in-\ncrease electric-vehicle production, compliance with \nCalifornia\u2019s standards is mandatory.  Second, in \nMurthy the government\u2019s alleged influence might not \nhave mattered at all.  Id., slip op., at 12.  Here, the \nwhole point of California\u2019s standards (and EPA\u2019s \nwaiver) is to require electrification beyond what the \nmarket was demanding.  Third, and what the Court in \nMurthy called the \u201ckey point,\u201d id. at 25 n.10, the gov-\nernment action there had concluded by the time suit \nwas brought.  There was no obvious ongoing harm for \nthe courts to correct, and so this Court could only \n\u201cspeculat[e]\u201d about redressability.  Id. at 22, 24-\n25.  Here, California\u2019s standards and mandate were re-\ninstated just months before petitioners brought suit \nand are still in place today.  Unlike Murthy, this is a \ncase where redressability should be beyond question.   \nThe court of appeals nevertheless demanded that \nthe fuel-manufacturer petitioners supply additional ev-\nidence of automakers\u2019 plans.  Although the court \nacknowledged that it was \u201cpossible\u201d that automakers \nwould change their plans and sell more liquid-fuel ve-\nhicles, it faulted petitioners for failing to supply \u201crec-\nord evidence,\u201d such as \u201cadditional affidavits.\u201d  App., in-\nfra, 24a (citation omitted).  Petitioners\u2019 standing decla-\nrations already pointed out that California itself had \nprojected that a waiver would \u201creduce emissions \nthrough reductions in fuel production.\u201d  C.A. Pet. \nStanding Addendum, Swenton Decl. at 5-6 (citation \n\n20 \n \n \nomitted).  They further explained that petitioners\u2019 in-\njuries would be ameliorated if the waiver were vacated.  \nC.A. Pet. Standing Addendum, Swenton Decl. at 7.  An-\nother declaration from the California Air Resources \nBoard projected that without the standards, \u201caddi-\ntional gasoline-fueled vehicles\u201d would likely be \u201cpro-\nduced and sold during these model years.\u201d  C.A. States\u2019 \nInt. Mot., Vanderspek Decl. \u00b6 22.  But that was not \nenough for the court of appeals.  In context, it appears \nthat the only kind of evidence the court would have \nfound sufficient is an affidavit from an automaker it-\nself, promising to change its production or pricing if the \nwaiver were vacated.   \nThat requirement is doubly wrong.  First, the court \nof appeals did not even acknowledge Bennett or De-\npartment of Commerce, or recognize that this Court \nhas allowed plaintiffs to draw logical inferences about \nrational economic behavior in assessing causation and \nredressability.  The court below did not ask whether \nthe withdrawal of a special regulatory license to Cali-\nfornia will have \u201cpredictable effects\u201d on vehicle sales.  \nDepartment of Commerce, 558 U.S. at 768.  It simply \nassumed that every effect must match up to a line in an \naffidavit. \nSecond, making matters worse, the court of appeals \nappeared to require plaintiffs to obtain affidavits from \nthe directly regulated parties\u2014here, the automakers.  \nBut directly regulated parties may have good reasons \nfor not wanting to participate in the litigation.  Maybe \nthey intend to pass on the costs, or the government has \ngarnered their complicity with some carrot that makes \nup for the regulatory stick.  Indeed, that is exactly \nwhat happened here, as several automakers entered \ninto \u201cCalifornia Framework Agreements\u201d committing \n\n21 \n \n \nthemselves to acceding to California\u2019s standards in ex-\nchange for certain benefits, like additional lead time.  \nC.A. Resp.-Int. Br. 4.  \nPetitioners\u2019 standing to challenge an agency action \nshould not depend on automakers\u2019 current preferences \nto partner with them.  The contrary rule adopted below \ncreates an unworkable hurdle to establishing standing \nin agency rule challenges\u2014one with no basis in prece-\ndent or logic.   \n3.  The court\u2019s flawed approach could doom any \nchallenge to a similar time-limited agency rule that re-\nquires some lead time to implement.  Petitioners sued \nwithin 60 days of EPA\u2019s March 2022 order.  Yet the \ncourt held that petitioners already could not obtain ef-\nfective relief because of the waiver\u2019s \u201crelatively short,\u201d \nfour-year \u201cduration.\u201d  App., infra, 22a; see Davis v. \nFEC, 554 U.S. 724, 734 (2008) (standing is assessed as \nof the date \u201cwhen the suit was filed\u201d).  Additionally, by \ngrounding its determination in standing, rather than \nmootness, the court dismissed the case without even \nholding EPA to its burden of establishing mootness or \nconsidering exceptions. \nB. The Decision Below Creates A Conflict \nAmong The Courts Of Appeals  \nBy imposing artificial hurdles on Article III\u2019s re-\ndressability requirement, the court of appeals split \nfrom several other courts of appeals.  The Second, \nFifth, Eighth, and Ninth Circuits\u2014and even the D.C. \nCircuit in other cases\u2014have all found standing based \non a law\u2019s coercive or predictable effects on third par-\nties, without requiring the sort of record evidence de-\nmanded below.  Under the D.C. Circuit\u2019s approach in \n\n22 \n \n \nthis case, those cases would have been (wrongly) dis-\nmissed on standing grounds.  \nThe Second Circuit has found standing based on a \nrule\u2019s predictable effects on third parties, without re-\nquiring third-party affidavits or similar evidence.  In \nNRDC v. NHTSA, 894 F.3d 95 (2018), the court of ap-\npeals considered an environmental group\u2019s challenge \nto NHTSA\u2019s decision to delay a rule increasing civil \npenalties for violations of fuel-economy standards.  The \npetitioners asserted an environmental injury based on \nthe assumption that third-party automakers would be \nless compliant when civil penalties were lower.  Id. at \n104.  In finding standing, the court relied on \u201ccommon \nsense and basic economics,\u201d which \u201ctell us that the in-\ncreased cost of unlawful conduct will make that conduct \nless common.\u201d  Id. at 105.  Automaker intervenors \nthere had posited that penalties \u201cha[d] the potential\u201d \nto affect their decisions, ibid., but the court did not de-\nmand affidavits proving how automakers would be-\nhave. \nThe Fifth Circuit has followed the same approach.  \nIn General Land Office v. Biden, 71 F.4th 264 (2023), \nthe court of appeals considered Texas\u2019s challenge to \nthe Department of Homeland Security\u2019s decision to di-\nvert funds appropriated for the construction of a wall \nalong the United States\u2013Mexico border.  Texas as-\nserted injuries premised on the assumption that the di-\nversion of funds would cause more unlawful immigra-\ntion.  Without requiring affidavits from undocumented \nimmigrants, the Fifth Circuit adopted the common-\nsense point that \u201c[i]n the absence of longer walls, at \nleast some illegal aliens who otherwise would have \nbeen prevented from entering Texas will seek\u201d benefits \nfrom the State.  Id. at 273.   \n\n23 \n \n \nThe Eighth Circuit, too, has relied on the predicta-\nble effects on third parties to find an injury redressa-\nble, without requiring a third-party affidavit.  Wieland \nv. Department of Health & Human Services, 793 F.3d \n949 (2015), involved a challenge to provisions of the Af-\nfordable Care Act that required certain insurers to \ncover contraceptive services.  Plaintiffs, who wanted a \ncontraception-free option, satisfied the redressability \nrequirement, because although an order enjoining \nthose laws would not require insurers to offer a  \ncontraception-free option, it was \u201clikely\u201d that insurers \nwould respond that way.  Id. at 957.   \nThe Ninth Circuit has applied similar reasoning.  It \nfound standing for plaintiffs challenging a California \ndirective that required certain insurers to offer abor-\ntion coverage.  See Skyline Wesleyan Church v. Cali-\nfornia Dep\u2019t of Managed Health Care, 968 F.3d 738, \n750 (2020).  The court of appeals did not demand affi-\ndavits from the insurers, concluding both that the di-\nrective had a \u201cdeterminative or coercive effect\u201d on the \ninsurers, and that \u201cthe predictable effect\u201d of a favora-\nble judicial decision included that \u201cat least one insurer \nwould be willing to sell\u201d a plan without abortion cover-\nage.  Ibid. \nThe decision below is not even faithful to the D.C. \nCircuit\u2019s own standing precedent.  In Energy Future \nCoalition, 793 F.3d 141, a case with strikingly parallel \nfacts to this one, the D.C. Circuit held that fuel produc-\ners had standing to challenge an EPA rule effectively \nbanning vehicle manufacturers from using certain fuel \nin emissions testing.  Id. at 144.  In an opinion by then-\nJudge Kavanaugh, the court held that the plaintiffs had \nestablished redressability, reasoning that \u201cif EPA per-\nmitted vehicle manufacturers to use\u201d the contested test \n\n24 \n \n \nfuel, \u201cthere is substantial reason to think that at least \nsome vehicle manufacturers would use it.\u201d  Ibid.  The \ncourt credited the common-sense, predictable effects \nof EPA\u2019s rule on third parties.  Yet here, after criticiz-\ning petitioners for believing their standing was \u201cself-\nevident\u201d under existing precedent, App., infra, 31a, the \ncourt below failed to even address this precedent on \nwhich petitioners\u2019 standing argument was based. \nUltimately, the court of appeals\u2019 decision in this case \ncannot be squared with any of the above decisions.  In \neach of them, the court relied on common-sense infer-\nences about how third parties behave in response to le-\ngal barriers to certain behavior.  None of them de-\nmanded the specific factual showing that the court re-\nquired here.  This Court should correct the D.C. Cir-\ncuit\u2019s outlier position before it sows significant confu-\nsion in this area. \nC. The Question Presented Is Important And \nWarrants Review In This Case \nThe question presented is exceptionally important, \nand this case presents an appropriate vehicle to con-\nsider it. \n1. The decision below threatens to chill legitimate \nchallenges to agency action.  The D.C. Circuit has tra-\nditionally served as the primary home for litigation un-\nder the Administrative Procedure Act, and it is the ex-\nclusive venue for challenges to emission standards un-\nder the Clean Air Act.  That makes its new barrier to \nagency challenges especially problematic.  As the deci-\nsions in the circuit split illustrate, there are many cir-\ncumstances in which third parties directly regulated by \nan agency rule have different incentives from an in-\n\n25 \n \n \njured petitioner.  Here, the preferences of car manu-\nfacturers and fuel manufacturers may diverge, includ-\ning because car manufacturers have been offered some \nregulatory flexibility that benefits them but not fuel \nproducers.  In other cases, a similar dynamic may arise \nbetween businesses and consumers, insurers and in-\nsured parties, and any number of other sets of potential \npetitioners.  If every regulatory petitioner in the D.C. \nCircuit must secure the cooperation of a directly regu-\nlated party to establish standing, a significant swath of \nchallenges may be doomed from the start. \nThe D.C. Circuit\u2019s unnecessary and unprecedented \nhurdle also creates bad incentives for agencies.  Under \nthe D.C. Circuit\u2019s rule, agencies could intentionally \nstructure their actions to placate directly regulated \nparties and thereby foreclose future litigation.  Those \nactions would still have sweeping effect, but the di-\nrectly regulated parties\u2014who would be the only  \npotential plaintiffs\u2014would have no incentive to sue.  \nThe result is an agency roadmap of particular concern \nbecause it insulates even major decisions like this one \nfrom judicial review. \nAt bottom, the entire purpose of California\u2019s stand-\nards and EPA\u2019s waiver determination is to reduce  \nliquid-fuel usage and mandate electrification.  That \ngoal is existential to the liquid-fuel industry, even if it \ndoes not immediately threaten car manufacturers.  \nFuel manufacturers are the obvious parties to chal-\nlenge the regulations.  The fact that fuel producers are \nnot directly regulated, when they are the direct target \nof the regulations, should not prevent them from estab-\nlishing their standing to sue. \n\n26 \n \n \n2. This case presents an appropriate vehicle for ad-\ndressing this important issue.  The redressability ques-\ntion determines petitioners\u2019 standing, as neither the \ncourt of appeals nor EPA has questioned petitioners\u2019 \nshowing of injury or causation.  See App., infra, 20a.  \nEPA has raised concerns about mootness, see id. at \n25a, but the Court can decide this case before it be-\ncomes moot.  The party asserting mootness \u201cbears the \nburden to establish\u201d that the case \u201chas become moot.\u201d  \nWest Virginia, 597 U.S. at 719.  To meet that burden, \nEPA would have to show that \u201cit is impossible\u201d for the \nCourt \u201cto grant any effectual relief.\u201d  United States v. \nWashington, 596 U.S. 832, 837 (2022) (emphasis \nadded).  It is far from impossible here:  if this Court \ngrants certiorari in October Term 2024, it will presum-\nably render a decision before model year 2025 ends.  \nAnd even if EPA could somehow establish mootness, \nthis case would fall within the capable-of-repetition ex-\nception because of the order\u2019s relatively short duration \nand the likelihood that petitioners will be \u201csubjected to \nthe same action again\u201d when EPA issues future waiv-\ners.  United States v. Sanchez-Gomez, 584 U.S. 381, 391 \n(2018).   \nII. THIS COURT SHOULD ALSO REACH THE \nMERITS AND VACATE THE WAIVER  \nThis Court should also grant the second question \npresented and decide whether EPA has the authority \nto grant California a preemption waiver to address \nglobal climate change.  Because California\u2019s waiver ex-\npires at the end of model year 2025, it is quite possible \nthe D.C. Circuit will not decide the merits on remand \nin time for this Court\u2019s subsequent review.  This EPA \nwill no doubt take the same approach to its next waiver \n\n27 \n \n \ndeterminations, and petitioners will then spend years \nsuffering ongoing injury from California\u2019s next set of \nunlawful standards and mandates.  Reaching the mer-\nits now would avoid that serious unfairness.  EPA is \nwrong on the merits, and there is no reason to wait ad-\nditional years to resolve an issue the D.C. Circuit has \npunted for over a decade. \nA. EPA\u2019s Decision Is Wrong \nThe Clean Air Act does not authorize the preemp-\ntion waiver that EPA granted here.  Section 209(a) es-\ntablishes federal control over motor-vehicle-emission \nstandards.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(a).  Because of California\u2019s \nunique \u201csmog problem,\u201d Section 209(b) gives that State \nalone the right to set its own emission standards.  Mo-\ntor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the U.S., Inc. v. New York \nState Dep\u2019t of Env\u2019t Conservation, 17 F.3d 521, 526 (2d \nCir. 1994).  But Congress\u2019s baseline was nationwide \npreemption, and it tailored California\u2019s special exemp-\ntion accordingly.  As a result, EPA must find that Cal-\nifornia\u2019s standards are \u201cneed[ed]\u201d to \u201cmeet compelling \nand extraordinary conditions\u201d in California.  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7543(b)(1)(B). \nThe California regulations here do not meet the \nstatutory criteria.  First, California\u2019s standards do not \ntarget conditions \u201cextraordinary\u201d to California be-\ncause they were created to address global climate \nchange, which is by definition not a phenomenon par-\nticular to California.  Second, California does not \n\u201cneed\u201d its separate standards to \u201cmeet\u201d those condi-\ntions because, by EPA\u2019s own admission, the standards \nwill not materially reduce the impacts of climate \nchange in California or anywhere else.  And EPA\u2019s pri-\n\n28 \n \n \nmary defense\u2014that California needs its \u201cwhole pro-\ngram,\u201d even if not these particular standards\u2014lacks \nany basis in the text or common sense. \n1. Global \nclimate \nchange \nis \nnot \nan  \n\u201cextraordinary\u201d \nCalifornia \ncondition \nwithin the meaning of Section 209 \nThe Clean Air Act\u2019s text, structure, and history \ndemonstrate that the phrase \u201ccompelling and extraor-\ndinary conditions\u201d refers to California\u2019s distinctive lo-\ncal pollution problems; it does not encompass condi-\ntions with global cause and effect, like climate change. \na. California\u2019s separate emission standards must be \nneeded to meet \u201ccompelling and extraordinary condi-\ntions.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(b)(1)(B).  The plain meaning of \n\u201cextraordinary\u201d is \u201cmost unusual.\u201d  Webster\u2019s New In-\nternational Dictionary 807 (3d ed. 1961).  On its own, \nthat definition could mean \u201cmost unusual\u201d compared to \nordinary pollution problems or \u201cmost unusual\u201d com-\npared to other States\u2019 problems.  In context, it must \nmean the latter.  The Clean Air Act pairs \u201cextraordi-\nnary\u201d with \u201ccompelling,\u201d and \u201ccompelling\u201d already \ncaptures a sense of magnitude.  To avoid rendering \u201cex-\ntraordinary\u201d redundant, it must mean \u201cmost unusual\u201d \nas compared to other States.  \nRelated statutory provisions support reading the \nphrase \u201ccompelling and extraordinary\u201d to encompass \nsevere local conditions.  For example, Section 177 au-\nthorizes other States to adopt California\u2019s standards as \npart of approved plans for combatting the six criteria \npollutants that cause local pollution problems.  See \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7507.  Congress thus plainly contemplated \nthat the standards California would adopt under Sec-\n\n29 \n \n \ntion 209(b)\u2014that other States might copy under Sec-\ntion 177\u2014would help States attain local ambient air-\nquality standards within their respective borders.   \nMore generally, the structure of Section 209 makes \nclear that Section 209(b) is an exception from a uniform \nfederal regulatory regime.  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(a).  It \nwould make little sense to permit California to function \nas a junior-varsity EPA and deviate from a national \nregulatory framework to address conditions that are \nbroadly shared throughout the Nation. \nSection 209(b)\u2019s history and purpose confirm that it \nauthorizes preemption waivers only for California \nstandards aimed at local air-quality issues.  In drafting \nTitle II, Congress repeatedly identified California\u2019s \n\u201cpeculiar\u201d circumstances: its \u201cunique problems\u201d re-\nsulting from local emissions and pollution concentra-\ntions interacting with the State\u2019s distinctive \u201cclimate \nand topography.\u201d  H.R. Rep. No. 90-728, at 22 (1967).  \nAs the D.C. Circuit explained decades ago, \u201cclearly the \nintent\u201d of the waiver provision was to \u201cfocus on local \nair quality problems\u201d that \u201cmay differ substantially \nfrom those in other parts of the nation.\u201d  Ford Motor \nCo. v. EPA, 606 F.2d 1293, 1303 (1979) (emphasis \nadded).   \nb. Global climate change is not a condition \u201cextraor-\ndinary\u201d to California.  By definition, global climate \nchange is neither unique to California nor uniquely felt \nby the State.  As EPA found in 2019, when it comes to \nthe effects of climate change, California is not \u201cworse-\npositioned in relation to certain other areas.\u201d  84 Fed. \nReg. at 51,348 n.278.  In fact, \u201c[m]any parts of the \nUnited States, especially western States, may have is-\nsues [caused by climate change] related to drinking wa-\nter\u201d and \u201cwildfires, and effects on agriculture.\u201d  Id. at \n\n30 \n \n \n51,348.  In other words, \u201ceffects related to climate \nchange in California\u201d are \u201cnot sufficiently different \nfrom the conditions in the nation as a whole to justify \nseparate State standards.\u201d  Id. at 51,344.  EPA did not \nrevisit that finding in 2022.  The agency thus provided \nno basis to depart from its prior conclusion, let alone \nthe heightened showing necessary for a reversal. \nTo be sure, EPA argued below that California\u2019s \nstandards do address local conditions because they \nmay have side effects on local criteria pollution.  But \nthat argument is wrong both legally and factually.  As \na legal matter, EPA cannot contrive a new goal for Cal-\nifornia\u2019s standards not presented in California\u2019s waiver \napplication.  No one disputes that the express purpose \nof California\u2019s standards was to regulate global climate \nchange.  Moreover, EPA\u2019s argument is not supported \nby the factual record.  In the waiver reinstatement, \nEPA relied on the \u201clogical link\u201d between ozone pollu-\ntion and greenhouse gases\u2014namely, that ozone levels \nare \u201cexacerbate[d]\u201d by higher temperatures caused by \nglobal warming.  App., infra, 207a-208a.  But EPA pre-\nviously found that the State\u2019s rules would produce \n\u201clikely no change\u201d to climate-change conditions\u2014in-\ncluding rising temperatures\u2014in California.  84 Fed. \nReg. at 51,341.  If California\u2019s standards will not \nchange temperatures, then they cannot affect ozone \nlevels under EPA\u2019s \u201clogical link\u201d theory either. \n2. California does not \u201cneed\u201d its own  \nemission standards to \u201cmeet\u201d climate-\nchange conditions  \nEven if California faced \u201cextraordinary\u201d conditions \nwithin the meaning of Section 209(b) from global cli-\nmate change, it does not \u201cneed\u201d its greenhouse-gas \n\n31 \n \n \nstandards and zero-emission-vehicle mandate to \n\u201cmeet\u201d those conditions.  To the contrary, as EPA ex-\nplained in 2019, California\u2019s standards \u201cwill not mean-\ningfully address global air pollution problems of the \nsort associated with [greenhouse-gas] emissions.\u201d  \n84 Fed. Reg. at 51,347, 51,349.   \na. A Section 209(b) waiver is authorized when \n\u201cneed[ed]\u201d to \u201cmeet\u201d conditions in California\u2014that is, \nonly if the proposed California emission standards \nwould appreciably affect the conditions that warrant \nthem.  That accords with the ordinary meaning of the \nstatutory terms \u201cneed\u201d and \u201cmeet.\u201d  The verb \u201cneed\u201d \nmeans to \u201cbe necessary.\u201d  Webster\u2019s New International \nDictionary, supra, at 1512.  And the term \u201cnecessary\u201d \ntypically means \u201cessential; indispensable.\u201d  American \nHeritage Dictionary 877 (1st ed. 1969).  The verb \n\u201cmeet\u201d is complementary.  In this context, it means to \n\u201csatisfy (a demand, need, obligation).\u201d  Id. at 816.   \nPutting the terms together, two things are clear.  \nFirst, California must \u201cneed\u201d\u2014i.e., require as essential \nor very important\u2014specific standards that differ from \nfederal standards.  Second, California\u2019s standards \nmust meaningfully address the conditions that give rise \nto California\u2019s need for separate standards.  At a mini-\nmum, if the State\u2019s proposed standards have no impact \non those conditions, then they cannot be said to be nec-\nessary, essential, or indispensable to \u201cmeet\u201d the condi-\ntions the State faces.  \nb. Based on EPA\u2019s own undisturbed factual find-\nings, California does not satisfy that standard for a \npreemption waiver.  In vacating California\u2019s waiver, \nEPA previously found that California\u2019s greenhouse-\ngas standards would \u201clea[d] to little to no change\u201d in  \n\u201c[greenhouse-gas] emissions at a national level,\u201d and \n\n32 \n \n \n\u201cwould result in an indistinguishable change in global \ntemperatures\u201d and \u201clikely no change in temperatures \nor physical impacts resulting from anthropogenic cli-\nmate change in California.\u201d  84 Fed. Reg. at 51,341, \n51,353 (emphases added).  Critically, in reinstating the \nwaiver, EPA did not disturb these findings about the \nfutility of California\u2019s standards.   \n3. EPA\u2019s whole-program approach is wrong \nIn defending its reinstatement decision, EPA has \nprimarily argued that Section 209(b)(1)(B)\u2014which \npermits EPA to grant a preemption waiver only if \n\u201cneed[ed]\u201d to \u201cmeet\u201d \u201ccompelling and extraordinary \nconditions\u201d\u2014is effectively irrelevant.  Under EPA\u2019s \n\u201cwhole program\u201d approach, so long as California needs \nany separate standards at all\u2014say, to combat smog\u2014\nthe State has satisfied the \u201cneed[s] . . . to meet\u201d re-\nquirement.  See 87 Fed. Reg. at 14,335.  At that point, \nCalifornia can add on any other emission standards it \nwants and tackle global problems as it sees fit. \nEPA\u2019s whole-program approach is atextual and de-\nfies common sense.  EPA relies on language elsewhere \nin Section 209(b) requiring that California \u201cdeter-\nmine[] that the State standards will be, in the aggre-\ngate, at least as protective of public health and welfare \nas applicable [federal] standards.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7543(b)(1) (emphasis added).  But Section 209(b)\u2019s \u201cin \nthe aggregate\u201d language does not carry down to the \nrest of 209(b).  For example, Subsection (b)(1)(C) re-\nquires EPA to ensure that manufacturers have suffi-\ncient lead time to meet California\u2019s standards.  See \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7521(a)(2).  EPA does not assess whether \nmanufacturers would have adequate lead time \u201cin the \naggregate\u201d\u2014that would make no sense.  See 84 Fed. \n\n33 \n \n \nReg. at 51,332; see also C.A. Pet. Br. 46.  Similarly, \nEPA has a separate duty in Section 209(b)(1)(B) to de-\ntermine whether California \u201cneed[s] such State stand-\nards to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(b)(1)(B).  That determination, like the \nneighboring lead-time determination, is not done \u201cin \nthe aggregate.\u201d \nEPA\u2019s reading would also make the Section \n209(b)(1)(B) criteria meaningless. Congress already \ndetermined that California \u201cneed[s]\u201d its own emissions \nprogram by creating the preemption exception in the \nfirst place.  On EPA\u2019s view, however, subsection \n(b)(1)(B) serves no independent purpose so long as Cal-\nifornia has any air-quality issues.  This assertion can-\nnot withstand minimal scrutiny, as the D.C. Circuit \npanel appeared to recognize at oral argument.  See C.A. \nOral Arg. Tr. 45:30 (Wilkins, J., criticizing EPA\u2019s \n\u201cwhole program\u201d approach).  \n4. Clear-statement rules favor petitioners\u2019 \nreading \nEven if EPA\u2019s interpretation were possible, several \nclear-statement rules require petitioners\u2019 reading. \nFirst, principles of constitutional avoidance require \npetitioners\u2019 reading.  The State petitioners have ar-\ngued that Section 209(b) deviates from the \u201cfundamen-\ntal principle of equality of the states under the Consti-\ntution.\u201d  Bolln v. Nebraska, 176 U.S. 83, 89 (1900).  This \nequal-sovereignty question is at least a serious one, \nand this Court should adopt a more modest interpreta-\ntion of California\u2019s waiver authority to avoid it.  Solid \nWaste Agency of N. Cook Cty. v. U.S. Army Corps of \nEng\u2019rs, 531 U.S. 159, 160 (2001).  Even if Congress \ncould grant California the unique ability to address a \n\n34 \n \n \nlocal problem, it would be a far graver intrusion on \nequal-sovereignty principles to grant California alone \nthe ability to address global climate change.  Cf. South \nCarolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301, 328-329 (1964) \n(\u201cThe doctrine of the equality of States\u201d does not bar \n\u201cremedies for local evils which have subsequently ap-\npeared.\u201d).   \nSecond, the major-questions doctrine applies to Cal-\nifornia\u2019s efforts to tackle global climate change and \nforce a transition to electric vehicles.  This Court \u201cex-\npect[s] Congress to speak clearly if it wishes to assign \nto an agency decisions of \u2018vast economic and political \nsignificance.\u2019\u201d  Utility Air Regul. Grp. v. EPA, \n573 U.S. 302, 324 (2014) (citation omitted).  On EPA\u2019s \nview, Section 209 authorizes the agency to permit Cal-\nifornia to adopt vehicle-emission standards to tackle \nclimate change, and to force a transition to electric ve-\nhicles that would have enormous repercussions for the \nnational economy, the States\u2019 electric grids, and na-\ntional security.  This Court should \u201cgreet\u201d EPA\u2019s \u201cas-\nsertions of \u2018extravagant statutory power over the na-\ntional economy\u2019 with \u2018skepticism.\u2019\u201d  West Virginia,  \n597 U.S. at 724 (citation omitted). \nThird, the federalism canon points in the same di-\nrection.  Congress must be \u201cunmistakably clear in the \nlanguage of the statute\u201d if it \u201cintends to alter the \u2018usual \nconstitutional balance between the States and the Fed-\neral government.\u2019\u201d Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, \n460-461 (1991) (citation omitted).  Yet under EPA\u2019s \nview, California alone among the States can regulate \nthe nation\u2019s automobile market in the service of ad-\ndressing climate change and forcing a transition to \nelectric vehicles. \n\n35 \n \n \nB. The Question Presented Is Important, Is  \nImplicated In The States\u2019 Petition, And  \nRepeatedly Evades Review \nThe extent of EPA\u2019s authority to grant California a \npreemption waiver warrants this Court\u2019s immediate \nreview.  It is a question that shapes the direction of the \nentire country\u2019s automobile industry but that has re-\npeatedly evaded judicial scrutiny.  And it is a question \nantecedent to the constitutional issue that the court of \nappeals reached and that is the subject of the State pe-\ntitioners\u2019 concurrent challenge. \n1.  Section 209(b), if construed to allow California \nto tackle nationwide issues like global climate change, \nbecomes a huge source of power to regulate the coun-\ntry\u2019s economy.  California is a significant market in its \nown right, and 17 States and the District of Columbia \nhave opted into at least some of California\u2019s standards.  \nSee supra, p. 10.  Additionally, both EPA and NHTSA \nhave relied on California\u2019s standards in setting their \nrespective (and unlawful) vehicle-emission standards \naimed at forcing electrification.  See 86 Fed. Reg. \n74,434, 74,457-74,458 (Dec. 30, 2021); 87 Fed. Reg. \n25,710, 25,762-25,765 (May 2, 2022).  No wonder Cali-\nfornia\u2019s governor described its vehicle-emission rules \nas \u201cone of the most significant steps to the elimination \nof the tailpipe as we know it.\u201d  Coral Davenport et al., \nCalifornia to Ban the Sale of New Gasoline Cars, N.Y. \nTimes (Aug. 24, 2022), https://www.nytimes.com/2022/ \n08/24/climate/california-gas-cars-emissions.html. \nA wait-and-see approach would embolden California \nto stretch Section 209(b) even further.  Since petition-\ners brought this case, California has adopted its \nso-called Advanced Clean Cars II standards, along \nwith Advanced Clean Fleets and Advanced Clean \n\n36 \n \n \nTrucks rules, which collectively mandate 100% electri-\nfication of every class of new vehicles by 2036.  See \nCARB, Public Hearing to Consider the Proposed Ad-\nvanced Clean Cars II Regulations 12 (Apr. 12, 2022), \nhttp://ww2.arb.ca.gov/sites/default/files/barcu/regact/2022 \n/accii/isor.pdf.  EPA\u2019s waiver thus enables California to \nforce automakers to electrify their entire fleets in Cal-\nifornia and any State that adopts its standards. \n2. This Court should also grant review of the sec-\nond question because the States\u2019 anticipated petition \npresents a serious constitutional question that should \nbe considered together with petitioners\u2019 statutory chal-\nlenge.  The State petitioners are challenging the D.C. \nCircuit\u2019s decision holding that Section 209 does not vi-\nolate the principle of equal sovereignty.  Unless this \nCourt grants review of both questions presented here, \nthe Court will not have complete briefing on a narrower \nstatutory alternative to resolving the States\u2019 constitu-\ntional challenge.   \n3. Finally, this Court should hear the second ques-\ntion presented because it has for too long evaded this \nCourt\u2019s review and may otherwise continue to do so.  \nThe challenged waiver is in effect only through model \nyear 2025.  That means that there will likely be time for \na merits decision in this Court, or a remand and poten-\ntial merits decision in the court of appeals, but not both \nwithout having to litigate mootness issues that may \ncomplicate this Court\u2019s review.  \nPetitioners have endured decades of regulatory \nwhiplash only for the D.C. Circuit to repeatedly reject \nany legal challenges on threshold grounds.  Absent this \nCourt\u2019s review, petitioners will be back at square one, \nhaving to litigate additional challenges to EPA\u2019s next \nwaiver, all while suffering ongoing injury.  Critical \n\n37 \n \n \nAmerican industries deserve the certainty that can \nonly be provided by this Court\u2019s finally defining the ex-\ntent of EPA\u2019s authority under Section 209(b).   \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be \ngranted. \n \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nERIC D.

REGAN, IN HIS OFFICIAL \nCAPACITY AS ADMINISTRATOR OF THE U.S. \nENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY, \nRespondents, \nADVANCED ENERGY UNITED, et al., \nIntervenors\nSeptember 15, 2023, Argued; April 9, 2024, Decided\nOn Petitions for Review of a Final Action \nof the Environmental Protection Agency \n(1a)\n\n2a\nOPINION OF THE COURT\nBefore: Wilkins, Childs, and Garcia, Circuit Judges.\nOpinion for the Court filed Per Curiam.\nPer Curiam: These consolidated petitions for review \nconcern a 2022 decision by the Environmental Protection \nAgency (\u201cEPA\u201d) to reinstate the EPA\u2019s prior decision, \nin 2013, to waive federal preemption of two California \nregulations regarding automobile emissions under the \nClean Air Act. The regulations in question are a standard \nlimiting greenhouse gas emissions and a requirement that \na certain percentage of new vehicles manufactured in the \nstate each year be zero-emissions vehicles (\u201cZEV\u201d), see \n13 Cal. Code Regs. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a01961.3, 1962.2, respectively. Two \nsets of Petitioners challenge the EPA\u2019s decision. The \nfirst group of Petitioners comprises seventeen states \n(\u201cState Petitioners\u201d).1 The second group of Petitioners \nincludes entities that produce or sell liquid fuels and the \nraw materials used to produce those fuels, along with \nassociations whose members include such entities (\u201cFuel \nPetitioners\u201d).2 Both State and Fuel Petitioners claim that \n1.\u2002 State Petitioners are the State of Ohio, State of Alabama, \nState of Arkansas, State of Georgia, State of Indiana, State of \nKansas, Commonwealth of Kentucky, State of Louisiana, State of \nMississippi, State of Missouri, State of Montana, State of Nebraska, \nState of Oklahoma, State of South Carolina, State of Texas, State of \nUtah, and State of West Virginia.\n2.\u2002 Fuel Petitioners are American Fuel & Petrochemical \nManufacturers, Clean Fuels Development Coalition, Diamond \nAlternative Energy, LLC, Domestic Energy Producers Alliance, \n\n3a\nthe EPA was not authorized to grant California the waiver \nunder the Clean Air Act. Fuel Petitioners argue that the \nEPA exceeded its statutory authority under the Clean \nAir Act. State Petitioners, meanwhile, contend that the \nEPA\u2019s waiver reinstatement decision was contrary to law \nbecause the relevant California regulations are preempted \nby a separate federal statute, the Energy Policy and \nConservation Act of 1975 (\u201cEPCA\u201d), 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a032919(a). \nState Petitioners also claim that by granting a waiver \nto California alone, the EPA violated a constitutional \nrequirement that the federal government treat states \nequally in terms of their sovereign authority. We hold that \nFuel Petitioners lack standing to raise their statutory \nclaim, and that State Petitioners lack standing to raise \ntheir preemption claim, because neither set of Petitioners \nhas demonstrated that their claimed injuries would be \nredressed by a favorable decision by this Court. While \nwe hold that State Petitioners have standing to raise their \nconstitutional claim, we reject it on the merits.\nI.\nA.\nWhile the Clean Air Act typically grants states broad \ndiscretion to meet federal air quality goals, emissions \nstandards for new automobiles are promulgated at the \nEnergy Marketers of America, ICM, Inc., Illinois Corn Growers \nAssociation, Iowa Soybean Association, Kansas Corn Growers \nAssociation, Michigan Corn Growers Association, Minnesota \nSoybean Growers Association, Missouri Corn Growers Association, \nNational Association of Convenience Stores, South Dakota Soybean \nAssociation, and Valero Renewable Fuels Company, LLC.\n\n4a\nfederal level. The Clean Air Act empowers the EPA to \npromulgate federal emissions standards for those vehicles, \nsee 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07521, and it preempts any corresponding \nstate regulation, expressly preventing the adoption of \nemissions standards for new vehicles and/or engines as \nfollows:\n(a) Prohibition\nNo State or any political subdivision thereof \nshall adopt or attempt to enforce any standard \nrelating to the control of emissions from new \nmotor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines \nsubject to this part. No State shall require \ncertification, inspection, or any other approval \nrelating to the control of emissions from any \nnew motor vehicle or new motor vehicle engine \nas condition precedent to the initial retail sale, \ntitling (if any), or registration of such motor \nvehicle, motor vehicle engine, or equipment.\nId. \u00a7\u00a07543(a) (\u201cSection 209(a)\u201d). However, the Clean Air \nAct permits the EPA to waive application of Section 209(a) \nto any state under certain circumstances:\n(b) Waiver\n(1) The Administrator shall, after notice \nand opportunity for public hearing, waive \napplication of this section to any State which \nhas adopted standards (other than crankcase \nemission standards) for the control of emissions \n\n5a\nfrom new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle \nengines prior to March 30, 1966, if the State \ndetermines that the State standards will be, \nin the aggregate, at least as protective of \npublic health and welfare as applicable Federal \nstandards. No such waiver shall be granted if \nthe Administrator finds that\u2014\n(A) the determination of the State is \narbitrary and capricious,\n(B) such State does not need such State \nstandards to meet compelling and \nextraordinary conditions, or\n(C) such State standards and accompanying \nenforcement procedures are not consistent \nwith section 7521(a) of this title.\n(2) If each State standard is at least as stringent \nas the comparable applicable Federal standard, \nsuch State standard shall be deemed to be at \nleast as protective of health and welfare as such \nFederal standards for purposes of paragraph \n(1).\n(3) In the case of any new motor vehicle or new \nmotor vehicle engine to which State standards \napply pursuant to a waiver granted under \nparagraph (1), compliance with such State \nstandards shall be treated as compliance with \napplicable Federal standards for purposes of \nthis subchapter.\n\n6a\nId. \u00a7\u00a07543(b) (\u201cSection 209(b)\u201d). California is the only \nstate that had adopted standards (other than crankcase \nemission standards) for the control of emissions from new \nmotor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines as of March \n30, 1966. See Motor & Equip. Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 627 F.2d \n1095, 1100 n.1, 201 U.S. App. D.C. 109 (D.C. Cir. 1979).\nIf California applies to promulgate automobile \nemissions standards that it has determined are at least \nas protective of public health and welfare as the existing \nfederal regulations, the Clean Air Act requires the EPA to \nwaive preemption as to those regulations, unless certain \ncriteria (the \u201cwaiver denial criteria\u201d) are met. 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a07543(b). The EPA may refuse to grant a waiver only if: (1) \nCalifornia\u2019s \u201cdetermination .\u00a0.\u00a0. is arbitrary and capricious,\u201d \n(2) California \u201cdoes not need such State standards to meet \ncompelling and extraordinary conditions,\u201d or (3) the \n\u201cstandards and accompanying enforcement procedures \nare not consistent with [42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07521(a)].\u201d Id. \u00a7\u00a07543(b)\n(1)(A)\u2013(C). In other words, the federal regulations continue \nto act as the floor for emissions regulations, but California \ncan seek to enact its own more stringent regulatory \nprogram above those federal requirements.\nSections 209(a) and (b) of the Clean Air Act together \nmake up a statutory compromise between several \ncompeting interests. When Congress enacted the Clean \nAir Act in 1967, California suffered from significant air \nquality and pollution problems caused by motor vehicle \nemissions, which federal emissions regulations were \nunlikely to adequately address. See S. Rep. No. 90-403, \nat 33\u201334 (1967); H.R. Rep. No. 90-728, at 21\u201323, 96\u201397 \n\n7a\n(1967). California was also the only state with its own \nmotor vehicle emissions standards, and its leadership in \nautomobile emissions regulation had been valuable to the \nfederal government in crafting the Clean Air Act. See \nS. Rep. No. 90-403, at 33\u201334; H.R. Rep. No. 90-728, at \n21\u201323, 96\u201397. At the same time, automobile manufacturers \nwere growing concerned that other states might begin \nregulating automobile emissions, subjecting them to a \npatchwork of regulatory obligations and significantly \nincreasing manufacturing costs. See H.R. Rep. No. \n90-728, at 21; see also Engine Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 88 \nF.3d 1075, 1079, 319 U.S. App. D.C. 12 (D.C. Cir. 1996). \nCongress enacted Sections 209(a) and (b) to balance the \nfears of automobile manufacturers, California\u2019s need for \nbespoke regulation, and the federal interest in allowing \nCalifornia to test new emissions regulations. Section \n209(a) addresses the fears of automakers and ensures \nnational uniformity in automobile emissions standards \nby preempting state regulation. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07543(a). \nMeanwhile, Section 209(b) grandfathers in California\u2019s \nregulatory program and allows it to continue innovating \nnew solutions to automobile pollution. See id. \u00a7\u00a07543(b); \nsee also Engine Mfrs. Ass\u2019n, 88 F.3d at 1080.\nB.\nThe D.C. Circuit is familiar with interpreting the \nClean Air Act. Shortly following the enactment of Section \n209(b), the D.C. Circuit addressed the question of how \nCalifornia should determine that its regulations are more \nprotective than the federal regulations. See Motor & Equip. \nMfrs. Ass\u2019n, 627 F.2d at 1095. California sought to impose \n\n8a\nregulations on oxides of nitrogen that were significantly \nmore stringent than their federal counterparts. Id. at \n1110 n.32. However, due to technological constraints, \nemissions control devices could not be constructed to \nmeet both California\u2019s oxides of nitrogen standard and \na carbon monoxide standard as stringent as the federal \nstandard. Id. In an effort to impose its high oxides of \nnitrogen standard, California proposed a carbon monoxide \nstandard that was less stringent than the federal carbon \nmonoxide standard. Id. The EPA allowed California\u2019s \nstringent oxides of nitrogen standard to make up for \nits less stringent carbon monoxide standard, as long as \nits regulatory program as a whole was more protective \nthan the federal regulations. Id. Dissatisfied with this \ndecision, opponents of California\u2019s regulations argued \nthat Section 209(b) required California to show that \nits carbon monoxide standard was individually more \nprotective than the federal carbon monoxide standard. In \n1977, Congress resolved this dispute by amending Section \n209(b). The new language of Section 209(b) made explicit \nthat California need only determine that its standards are, \n\u201cin the aggregate, at least as protective of public health \nand welfare\u201d as the federal standards. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07543(b)\n(1). So long as California has made that determination, \nthe EPA must grant California a waiver unless the EPA \nfinds that any of the waiver denial criteria are met. See \nid. \u00a7\u00a07543(b)(1)(A)\u2013(C). The amendment ensures that \nCalifornia is not required to determine that each new \nproposed regulation is more protective than its federal \ncounterpart. Id. It was intended to give California the \n\u201cbroadest discretion in selecting the best means to protect \n\n9a\nthe health of its citizens and the public welfare.\u201d H.R. Rep. \nNo. 95-294, at 301\u201302 (1977).3\nAfter Congress amended Section 209(b) to provide \nthat California need only determine that its standards \nwere, \u201cin the aggregate,\u201d at least as protective as the \nfederal standards, the EPA decided to apply a similar \napproach to its analysis of whether California\u2019s proposed \nstandards met any of the waiver denial criteria. See 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07543(b)(1)(A)\u2013(C). Thus, in examining whether \nany of the waiver denial criteria applied, the EPA \nconsidered only whether California\u2019s proposed standards, \nin the aggregate, met any of the criteria\u2014not whether \neach individual standard could be denied under any of \nthe criteria. The EPA continued to evaluate California\u2019s \nwaiver applications under Section 209(b) using this \naggregate method of evaluation for decades. In the fifty-\nfive years since Section 209(b) was originally enacted, \nthe EPA has granted California seventy-five waivers \nusing the aggregate method of evaluation. See California \nState Motor Vehicle Pollution Control Standards; \nAdvanced Clean Car Program; Reconsideration of a \nPrevious Withdrawal of a Waiver of Preemption; Notice \nof Decision, 87 Fed. Reg. 14337 (Mar. 14, 2022) (\u201c2022 \nWaiver Reinstatement Decision\u201d); see also EPA, Vehicle \n3.\u2002 The 1977 Clean Air Act amendments also empowered \nother states to choose between adopting the federal standards or \nthe California standards. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07507. As of the date of this \nopinion, seventeen states have chosen to adopt some portion of \nthe California regulations. See Cal. Air Res. Bd., States that Have \nAdopted California\u2019s Vehicle Regulations, https://perma.cc/HCS4-\nX7NP (last visited Mar. 27, 2024).\n\n10a\nEmissions California Waivers and Authorizations, \nhttps://perma.cc/5T7U-L8GE (last visited Mar. 27, 2024).\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, California\u2019s emissions \nstandards focused on ozone-generating pollutants, like \nnitrogen oxides, but over time, California expanded \nits regulatory program to restrict a variety of other \nemissions, such as methane and other greenhouse gases. \nSee, e.g., California State Motor Vehicle Pollution \nControl Standards; Waiver of Federal Preemption, 43 \nFed. Reg. 25729, 25735 (June 14, 1978); California State \nMotor Vehicle Pollution Control Standards; Waiver of \nFederal Preemption Notice of Decision, 49 Fed. Reg. \n18887, 18890 (May 3, 1984). In 1993, the EPA approved \na waiver of California\u2019s first ZEV standard, which \nrequired an annually increasing percentage of vehicles \nsold in California to produce zero tailpipe emissions. \nSee California State Motor Vehicle Pollution Control \nStandards; Waiver of Federal Preemption; Decision, 58 \nFed. Reg. 4166 (Jan. 13, 1993).\nC.\nIn recent decades, California has continued to face \nsignificant pollution and climate challenges. It contains \nseven of the ten worst areas for ozone pollution in the \ncountry and six of the ten worst areas for small particulate \nmatter. See 2022 Waiver Reinstatement Decision, 87 Fed. \nReg. at 14377 n.469. It also faces \u201cincreasing risks from \nrecord-setting fires, heat waves, storm surges, sea-level \nrise, water supply shortages and extreme heat.\u201d Id. at \n14363; see also id. at 14338\u201339 & nn.37, 43. And these \nconditions are exacerbated by climate change. Id. at \n\n11a\n14350 & n.165. Moreover, pollution and climate change \nhave particularly harmful impacts on California due to its \nlarge agriculture and ocean-based economies, dependence \non an over-stressed water supply, long coastlines, and \nsusceptibility to wildfires. See California State Motor \nVehicle Pollution Control Standards; Notice of Decision \nGranting a Waiver of Clean Air Act Preemption for \nCalifornia\u2019s 2009 and Subsequent Model Year Greenhouse \nGas Emission Standards for New Motor Vehicles, 74 Fed. \nReg. 32744, 32746 (July 8, 2009).\nTo combat these challenges, in 2005, California \napplied for a waiver for a new set of regulations limiting \ngreenhouse gas emissions. See Cal. Air Res. Bd., Low-\nEmission Vehicle Greenhouse Gas Program, https://\nperma.cc/VC85-GQ2S (last visited Mar. 27, 2024). The \nrequest sparked disagreement among several subsequent \npresidential administrations. Under President George \nW. Bush\u2019s Administration, the EPA initially denied the \nwaiver on the basis that the standards were not addressing \n\u201ccompelling and extraordinary conditions.\u201d California \nState Motor Vehicle Pollution Control Standards; \nNotice of Decision Denying a Waiver of Clean Air Act \nPreemption for California\u2019s 2009 and Subsequent Model \nYear Greenhouse Gas Emission Standards for New Motor \nVehicles, 73 Fed. Reg. 12156, 12159\u201363 (Mar. 6, 2008). One \nyear later, under the Obama Administration, the EPA \ndetermined that its initial decision to deny the waiver \nhad been based on an incorrect interpretation of Section \n209(b), and ultimately granted the waiver. California \nState Motor Vehicle Pollution Control Standards; \nNotice of Decision Granting a Waiver of Clean Air Act \nPreemption for California\u2019s 2009 and Subsequent Model \n\n12a\nYear Greenhouse Gas Emission Standards for New Motor \nVehicles, 74 Fed. Reg. 32744, 32745\u201346 (July 8, 2009).\nIn 2012, California applied for the waiver at issue in \nthis case, seeking to promulgate a new set of regulations \ncalled the Advanced Clean Car Program. See California \nState Motor Vehicle Pollution Control Standards; Notice of \nDecision Granting a Waiver of Clean Air Act Preemption \nfor California\u2019s Advanced Clean Car Program and a \nWithin the Scope Confirmation for California\u2019s Zero \nEmission Vehicle Amendments for 2017 and Earlier \nModel Years, 78 Fed. Reg. 2112 (Jan. 9, 2013). The new \nregulations included a Low Emission Vehicle (\u201cLEV\u201d) \nProgram, which set emissions requirements for new cars \nin Model Years 2017 to 2025 with the goal of reducing \ncarbon dioxide emissions by thirty-four percent, and a \nZEV Program, which required around fifteen percent of \nmanufacturers\u2019 fleets to be electric cars by Model Year \n2025. Id. The EPA initially granted the waiver in 2013. \nId. In response, automobile manufacturers in California \nbegan making investments to meet both programs\u2019 \nrequirements. See, e.g., Industry Resp.-Intervenor Br. \n2\u20134.\nIn 2018, after car manufacturers had adjusted their \nfleets to comply with California\u2019s Advanced Clean Car \nProgram, the EPA changed its course. It issued a notice of \nproposed rulemaking to withdraw the portions of the 2013 \nwaiver covering California\u2019s LEV and ZEV standards. \nSee The Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles \nRule for Model Years 2021-2026 Passenger Cars and Light \nTrucks, 83 Fed. Reg. 42986 (Aug. 24, 2018).\n\n13a\nThe EPA withdrew the 2013 waiver on September \n27, 2019. The Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) \nVehicles Rule Part One: One National Program, 84 Fed. \nReg. 51310 (Sept. 27, 2019) (\u201c2019 Withdrawal Decision\u201d). \nThe EPA offered three bases for the withdrawal. Id. at \n51328\u201341. First, the 2013 waiver conflicted with a recent \ndetermination by the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration (\u201cNHTSA\u201d) that state greenhouse gas \nregulations were preempted by a provision of the EPCA \nthat prohibits states from enacting their own fuel economy \nstandards. Id. at 51337\u201338; see also 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a032902(a), \n(f) (empowering the NHTSA to set federal fuel economy \nstandards); id. \u00a7\u00a032919(a) (preempting state fuel economy \nstandards). Second, the EPA had decided that it would \nno longer follow a \u201cwhole program\u201d interpretation of \nSection 209(b), and instead would evaluate whether each \nindividual California standard met the requirement that \nit be necessary to \u201cmeet compelling and extraordinary \nconditions.\u201d 2019 Withdrawal Decision, 84 Fed. Reg. at \n51341 (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07543(b)(1)). Third, California \ncould not show that its LEV and ZEV regulations were \nnecessary to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions \nbecause California could not show a \u201cparticularized \nnexus\u201d between greenhouse gas emissions and California\u2019s \nair pollution problems. Id. According to the EPA, because \ngreenhouse gas pollution from global sources is blended \nin the atmosphere, the consequences of climate change \nfrom which California suffered were not \u201ccompelling and \nextraordinary.\u201d Id. at 51333\u201334.\nFollowing recission of the 2013 waiver, automobile \nmanufacturers such as Honda, Ford, Volvo, BMW, \n\n14a\nand Volkswagen entered into independent agreements \nwith California to continue reducing emissions. See \nRevised 2023 and Later Model Year Light-Duty Vehicle \nGreenhouse Gas Emissions Standards, 86 Fed. Reg. \n74434, 74458 (Dec. 30, 2021). Under these agreements, \nthe automakers would continue to meet the LEV \nand ZEV standards in the California regulations. Id. \nAutomakers were motivated to sign these agreements by \nthe investments they had already made in updating their \nfleets and growing consumer demand for electric vehicles. \nSee J.A. 155\u201357.\nIn 2021, under the Biden Administration, the EPA \nrevisited its 2019 withdrawal of the 2013 waiver. California \nState Motor Vehicle Pollution Control Standards; \nAdvanced Clean Car Program; Reconsideration of \na Previous Withdrawal of a Waiver of Preemption; \nOpportunity for Public Hearing and Public Comment, \n86 Fed. Reg. 22421 (Apr. 28, 2021). On March 14, 2022, the \nEPA reinstated its 2013 waiver for California\u2019s Advanced \nClean Car Program. 2022 Waiver Reinstatement Decision, \n87 Fed. Reg. at 14332. As a result of that reinstatement, \nCalifornia\u2019s LEV and ZEV standards for Model Years \n2017 through 2025 came back into force. Id. at 14333. \nThe EPA provided three explanations for its 2022 Waiver \nReinstatement Decision: the EPA exceeded its inherent \nauthority to revisit its 2013 decision; it improperly \nrejected the \u201cwhole program\u201d approach; and it improperly \nconsidered the NHTSA\u2019s view of the EPCA, which was \nbeyond the scope of Section 209(b). Id. at 14333\u201335.\n\n15a\nD.\nOn May 12, 2022, State Petitioners filed a petition \nfor review in this Court challenging the EPA\u2019s decision \nto reinstate the 2013 waiver (22-1081). That same day, \nthree groups of Fuel Petitioners filed petitions for \nreview of the same EPA action (22-1083, 22-1084, and \n22-1085). The Court consolidated these cases (22-1081). \nCalifornia and several other states and cities (collectively, \n\u201cCalifornia\u201d),4 environmental organizations, 5 and \nautomobile manufacturers6 have intervened in support \nof respondents in the consolidated case.\n4.\u2002 The state and city intervenors are the City of Los Angeles, \nthe City of New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, the District \nof Columbia, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, \nIllinois, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New \nMexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, \nand Washington.\n5.\u2002 The environmental organization intervenors are the Center \nfor Biological Diversity, the Clean Air Council, the Conservation Law \nFoundation, the Environmental Defense Fund, the Environmental \nLaw and Policy Center, the National Parks Conservation Association, \nthe Natural Resources Defense Council, the Public Citizen, the \nSierra Club, and the Union of Concerned Scientists.\n6.\u2002 The automobile manufacturer intervenors are Ford Motor \nCompany, Volkswagen Group of America, Inc., BMW of North \nAmerica, LLC, American Honda Motor Co., Inc., Volvo Car USA \nLLC, the National Coalition for Advanced Transportation, Advanced \nEnergy Economy, Calpine Corporation, National Grid USA, the New \nYork Power Authority, and the Power Companies Climate Coalition.\n\n16a\nIn their petition, Fuel Petitioners argue that the 2022 \ndecision was arbitrary and capricious and exceeded the \nEPA\u2019s authority under Section 209(b) because climate \nchange is not a \u201ccompelling and extraordinary condition,\u201d \nand California does not \u201cneed\u201d its standards to \u201cmeet\u201d \nits climate conditions. See, e.g., Fuel Pet. Br. 10\u201311. In \nchallenging the EPA\u2019s determination of California\u2019s \n\u201cneed,\u201d Fuel Petitioners argue that the EPA\u2019s aggregate \napproach is wrong. Id. Meanwhile, State Petitioners \nclaim that by granting a waiver to California, but not to \nany other state, the EPA has violated State Petitioners\u2019 \nconstitutional right to equal sovereignty. See State Pet. \nBr. 28\u201333. State Petitioners also claim that the waiver \nis contrary to the preemption of state fuel economy \nstandards set out in the EPCA. See State Pet. Br. 33\u201341.\nWe hold that neither Fuel Petitioners as to their \nstatutory claims nor State Petitioners as to their EPCA \nclaims establish standing to bring suit, and thus we do \nnot reach the merits of their claims. We reject State \nPetitioners\u2019 constitutional claim on the merits.\nII.\nA.\nWe begin with the question whether either State or \nFuel Petitioners have standing based on their assertions \nthat the waiver will cause them economic injury. Fuel \nPetitioners premise their standing as to the entirety of \ntheir petition for review on their claimed economic injury. \nState Petitioners, meanwhile, premise their standing for \n\n17a\ntheir claim that the waiver is preempted by the EPCA on \ntheir alleged economic injury.\nA \u201cshowing of standing is \u2018an essential and unchanging\u2019 \npredicate to any exercise of our jurisdiction.\u201d Fla. \nAudubon Soc. v. Bentsen, 94 F.3d 658, 663, 320 U.S. App. \nD.C. 324 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (en banc) (quoting Lujan v. Defs. \nof Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560, 112 S.\u00a0Ct. 2130, 119 L.\u00a0Ed.\u00a02d \n351 (1992)). \u201c[S]tanding is assessed as of the time a suit \ncommences.\u201d Del Monte Fresh Produce Co. v. United \nStates, 570 F.3d 316, 324, 386 U.S. App. D.C. 406 (D.C. \nCir. 2009). The \u201cirreducible constitutional minimum of \nstanding contains three elements.\u201d Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560. \nFirst, the plaintiff must have suffered an injury-in-fact\u2014\nan \u201cinvasion of a judicially cognizable interest which is (a) \nconcrete and particularized and (b) actual or imminent, \nnot conjectural or hypothetical.\u201d Bennett v. Spear, 520 \nU.S. 154, 167, 117 S.\u00a0Ct. 1154, 137 L.\u00a0Ed.\u00a02d 281 (1997). \nSecond, there must be a \u201ccausal connection between the \ninjury and the conduct complained of\u2014the injury must be \nfairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant, \nand not the result of the independent action of some third \nparty not before the court.\u201d Id. Third, \u201cit must be \u2018likely,\u2019 \nas opposed to merely \u2018speculative,\u2019 that the injury will be \n\u2018redressed by a favorable decision.\u2019\u201d Lujan, 504 U.S. at \n561 (quoting Simon v. E. Ky. Welfare Rts. Org., 426 U.S. \n26, 38, 43, 96 S.\u00a0Ct. 1917, 48 L.\u00a0Ed.\u00a02d 450 (1976)).\n\u201cA petitioner bears the burden of establishing each\u201d \nof the elements of standing. Chamber of Com. of U.S. v. \nEPA, 642 F.3d 192, 200, 395 U.S. App. D.C. 193 (D.C. \nCir. 2011). To meet that burden, a petitioner must \u201cshow \n\n18a\na \u2018substantial probability\u2019 that it has been injured, that \nthe defendant caused its injury, and that the court could \nredress that injury.\u201d Sierra Club v. EPA, 292 F.3d 895, \n899, 352 U.S. App. D.C. 191 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (quoting API v. \nUnited States EPA, 216 F.3d 50, 63, 342 U.S. App. D.C. 159 \n(D.C. Cir. 2000)). And a petitioner may not wait to attempt \nto meet its burden of demonstrating standing until after \nthe respondent contests the issue. Rather, absent \u201cgood \ncause shown,\u201d a petitioner whose standing is not readily \napparent must show that it has standing in \u201cits opening \nbrief.\u201d Id. at 900\u201301. A petitioner may carry this \u201cburden \nof production by citing any record evidence relevant to its \nclaim of standing and, if necessary, appending to its filing \nadditional affidavits or other evidence sufficient to support \nits claim.\u201d Id.; see also D.C. Cir. R. 28(a)(7).\nWhether a petitioner has standing to challenge a \nparticular government action depends, in part, upon \nwhether the petitioner is \u201can object of the action\u201d at \nissue. Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561. When a petitioner is an \nobject of the action it seeks to challenge, causation and \nredressability are usually easy to demonstrate. Id. But \nwhen, as here, the petitioner \u201cis not [it]self the object of \nthe government action or inaction he challenges, standing \nis not precluded, but is ordinarily \u2018substantially more \ndifficult\u2019 to establish.\u201d Id. at 562 (quoting Allen v. Wright, \n468 U.S. 737, 758, 104 S.\u00a0Ct. 3315, 82 L.\u00a0Ed.\u00a02d 556 (1984)). \nBecause any injury to petitioners \u201chinges on actions taken \nby manufacturers, the petitioners carry \u2018the burden of \nadduc[ing] facts showing that those [third-party] choices \nhave been or will be made in such manner as to produce \ncausation and permit redressability of injury.\u2019\u201d Chamber \n\n19a\nof Com., 642 F.3d at 201 (alterations in original) (quoting \nCtr. for Biological Diversity v. United States DOI, 563 \nF.3d 466, 477, 385 U.S. App. D.C. 257 (D.C. Cir. 2009)).\nAs we will explain, these principles compel the \nconclusion that both State and Fuel Petitioners lack \nstanding premised on their claimed economic injuries \nbecause neither group of Petitioners has met their burden \nof demonstrating that those injuries are redressable.\nB.\nFuel Petitioners argue that, by requiring vehicle \nmanufacturers to sell vehicles that use less or no liquid \nfuel, California\u2019s LEV and ZEV requirements depress \nthe demand for liquid fuels.7 Fuel Petitioners and their \nmembers, who produce and sell liquid fuels and the \nraw materials used to produce those fuels, are thereby \nfinancially injured by the reduction in demand for those \nproducts. Fuel Pet. Br. 16; Fuel Pet. Reply Br. 3\u20134. In \nsupport of Fuel Petitioners\u2019 contention that they are \neconomically injured by the waiver, Fuel Petitioners \noffer over a dozen declarations by individuals who are \naffiliated with Fuel Petitioner entities and organizations; \nthe individuals explain that the entity or organization is \n7.\u2002 Fuel Petitioners include both associations and individual \nentities. Fuel Pet. Br. 16. Because, as we explain, we conclude that \nall Fuel Petitioners have failed to establish redressability, we need \nnot address whether any of the Fuel Petitioner associations have \nestablished organizational standing. Cf. Sierra Club, 292 F.3d at \n898 (laying out the requirements for establishing organizational \nstanding).\n\n20a\ninvolved with producing or selling fuel and that the waiver \ncauses Fuel Petitioners economic injury by reducing the \ndemand for fuel and related products.\nState Petitioners, meanwhile, allege three financial \ninjuries that they contend are caused by the waiver. \nFirst, the waiver causes manufacturers to increase the \ncost of conventional vehicles elsewhere in the country in \norder to account for the cost of meeting the requirements \nimposed on manufacturers by the waiver granted to \nCalifornia. State Petitioners explain that because they \npurchase conventional vehicles, the increase in the prices \nfor those vehicles that results from the waiver causes \nState Petitioners financial harm. State Pet. Br. 14\u201315. \nSecond, State Petitioners contend that the greater shift \nto electric vehicles that results from the waiver will \ncause State Petitioners to generate less fuel-tax revenue. \nId. Finally, State Petitioners argue that the increase \nin electric vehicles caused by the waiver will affect the \nStates\u2019 electrical grids. In support of their standing \nclaims, State Petitioners offer a declaration from each \nindividual State Petitioner and a declaration from an \neconomist, Benjamin Zycher, Ph.D. Each State Petitioner\u2019s \ndeclaration states that the state purchases conventional \n(that is, gas-or diesel-powered) vehicles. State Pet. \nAdd. 6\u201336. In his declaration, Dr. Zycher contends that \nCalifornia\u2019s ZEV requirement will have several economic \nimpacts on State Petitioners, including an increase in the \ncost of conventional vehicles nationwide, a \u201cdecline in the \nquality of delivered state services,\u201d a reduction in \u201cfuel \ntax revenues available for the provision of highway and \n\n21a\nroad services,\u201d and an \u201cincrease in the costs and prices of \ndelivering electric power services.\u201d State Pet. Add. 38\u201339.\nThe EPA and California both dispute that State \nand Fuel Petitioners\u2019 allegations and evidence establish \ninjury and causation sufficient to support standing. EPA \nBr. 23\u201328 (arguing State Petitioners fail to demonstrate \nstanding); California Br. 9\u201315 (arguing both State and Fuel \nPetitioners fail to demonstrate standing). For example, \nas to causation, California argues that both groups of \nPetitioners fail to demonstrate that their alleged injuries \nare caused by the 2022 waiver reinstatement, rather than \nthe original 2013 waiver or rising consumer demand for \nelectric vehicles more generally. California Br. 11, 14. But \nthis Court need not definitively decide whether either \nset of Petitioners has established injury or causation. \nHowever robust their claims of injury and causation \nare, State and Fuel Petitioners spend considerably less \ntime explaining how those injuries are redressable. \nIndeed, even assuming that both sets of Petitioners have \nestablished injury and causation sufficient for standing, \nPetitioners\u2019 standing arguments fail for the same reason: \nBoth groups of Petitioners fall far short of meeting their \nburden of demonstrating a \u201csubstantial probability\u201d that \ntheir alleged injuries would be redressed by a favorable \ndecision by this Court. Am. Petroleum, 216 F.3d at 63; see \nalso Sierra Club, 292 F.3d at 899\u2013900.\nFuel Petitioners assert in their opening brief\u2014\nwithout explanation or citation\u2014that this Court could \nredress their injuries \u201cby setting aside the action.\u201d Fuel \nPet. Br. 16. Fuel Petitioners\u2019 declarations offer little \n\n22a\nmore; to the extent that Fuel Petitioners\u2019 declarations \ndiscuss redressability at all, the declarations state that \nthe injuries discussed therein \u201cwould be substantially \nameliorated if EPA\u2019s decision were set aside.\u201d State \nPetitioners\u2019 opening brief is similarly conclusory regarding \nredressability. State Petitioners assert that their \u201cinjuries \nare redressable because a judgment setting aside the \nwaiver would eliminate the source of their injuries.\u201d State \nPet. Br. 16. However, none of the declarations submitted \nby State Petitioners with their opening brief addresses \nredressability at all.\nThe difficulty for Fuel and State Petitioners is \nthat their claimed injuries \u201chinge[] on\u201d the actions of \nthird parties\u2014the automobile manufacturers who are \nsubject to the waiver. Chamber of Com., 642 F.3d at \n201. Redressability, too, \u201chinge[s] on the response of\u201d \nthose same automobile manufacturers. Lujan, 504 U.S. \nat 562. Both groups of Petitioners\u2019 injuries would be \nredressed only if automobile manufacturers responded \nto vacatur of the waiver by producing and selling fewer \nnon-conventional vehicles or by altering the prices of their \nvehicles such that fewer non-conventional vehicles\u2014and \nmore conventional vehicles\u2014were sold.\nAnd, aside from turning on the actions of the automobile \nmanufacturers subject to the waiver, redressability is \nfurther complicated by the relatively short duration of \nthe waiver that Petitioners challenge. These petitions \nfor review concern only the EPA\u2019s decision, in March \n2022, to reinstate the waiver it had previously granted \nCalifornia as to Model Years 2017 through 2025. See 2022 \n\n23a\nWaiver Reinstatement Decision, 87 Fed. Reg. 14337. Thus, \nto meet their burden of demonstrating redressability, \nboth sets of Petitioners must demonstrate a \u201csubstantial \nprobability\u201d not only that automobile manufacturers are \nlikely to respond to a decision by this Court by changing \ntheir fleets in a way that alleviates their injuries in some \nway, but also that automobile manufacturers would do so \nrelatively quickly\u2014by Model Year 2025. Am. Petroleum, \n216 F.3d at 63.\nThe record evidence provides no basis for us to \nconclude that manufacturers would, in fact, change course \nwith respect to the relevant model years if this Court were \nto vacate the waiver. To begin, Petitioners fail to point to \nany evidence affirmatively demonstrating that vacatur of \nthe waiver would be substantially likely to result in any \nchange to automobile manufacturers\u2019 vehicle fleets by \nModel Year 2025. The only evidence points in the opposite \ndirection, indicating that automobile manufacturers need \nyears of lead time to make changes to their future model \nyear fleets. In a comment submitted to the EPA during the \nrulemaking process regarding the EPA\u2019s 2019 recission \nof the 2013 waiver, for example, Ford Motor Company \nstated that its product cycle requires several years of \nlead time for planning, and that its \u201cregulatory lead time \n(i.e., awareness of future regulatory requirements)\u201d is \nseven years. J.A. 637. Ford explained that, as a result, \nif the regulatory landscape shifted in some way, \u201clittle \nor nothing could be done to re-optimize the company\u2019s \nproduct plans, which are largely fixed for the next few \nyears.\u201d Id. Further, the record indicates that other \nautomobile manufacturers would also require years \n\n24a\nof lead time to alter their product plans. In comments \nsubmitted to the EPA during the EPA\u2019s rulemaking \nprocess regarding the 2022 waiver reinstatement, Tesla, \nInc. and Toyota Motor North America, Inc., explained \nthat their vehicle product cycles, too, can also begin years \nbefore a vehicle is launched. J.A. 371, 477; see also J.A. \n370 n.5 (summarizing similar statements from Chrysler \nGroup LLC, Hyundai America Technical Center, Inc., \nand Mitsubishi Motors North America). Thus, even \nif automobile manufacturers were inclined to change \ncourse so as to alleviate the Petitioners\u2019 injuries within \nthe given model years, it is far from clear that they could \ndo so within the model years covered by the waiver.8 To \nbe sure, it is possible that manufacturers could change \ntheir prices without modifying their production cycles, \nwhich may redress Petitioners\u2019 injuries because pricing \ncould affect the mix of conventional and electric vehicles \npurchased. But Petitioners point us to no evidence that \nmanufacturers would change their prices by Model Year \n2025 either.\nDespite the paucity of evidence in the record \nregarding the redressability of their injuries, neither \ngroup of Petitioners attempts to explain in any detail \nhow their injuries are redressable, let alone to \u201ccit[e] any \nrecord evidence\u201d or to file \u201cadditional affidavits or other \n8.\u2002 We also note that several automobile manufacturers have \nintervened in support of the EPA in this case. Those manufacturers \nexplain in their brief in support of the EPA that \u201cboth internal \nsustainability goals and external market forces\u201d are prompting \nmanufacturers to transition toward electric vehicles, irrespective \nof California\u2019s regulations. Industry Resp.-Intervenor Br. 6\u20137.\n\n25a\nevidence sufficient to support\u201d redressability. Sierra Club, \n292 F.3d at 900\u201301. Nor, for that matter, does either set \nof Petitioners grapple with the relatively short nature of \nthe waiver they challenge. Rather, all Petitioners seem to \nhave treated redressability as a foregone conclusion. See \nCrete Carrier Corp. v. EPA, 363 F.3d 490, 494, 361 U.S. \nApp. D.C. 54 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (petitioners lacked standing \nwhere they failed to produce \u201cactual evidence\u201d regarding \nhow the regulated parties \u201cwould respond\u201d to vacatur); \nBranton v. FCC, 993 F.2d 906, 912, 301 U.S. App. D.C. 244 \n(D.C. Cir. 1993) (\u201cA court is rightly reluctant to enter a \njudgment which may have no real consequence, depending \nupon the putative cost-benefit analyses of third parties \nover whom it has no jurisdiction and about whom it has \nalmost no information.\u201d).\nWhen asked about redressability at oral argument, \ncounsel for Fuel Petitioners emphasized that \nredressability\u2014as with each prong of standing\u2014is \nassessed when a lawsuit is first filed. Oral Argument \nTranscript 74; see also Del Monte, 570 F.3d at 325 (\u201c[S]\ntanding is assessed as of the time a suit commences.\u201d). True \nenough. But that does not help Fuel Petitioners: Even \u201cas \nof the time\u201d this lawsuit commenced, Fuel Petitioners had \nfailed to point to any evidence in the record showing that \ntheir alleged injuries were redressable. Del Monte, 570 \nF.3d at 325. Put differently, the flaw in Fuel Petitioners\u2019 \nstanding arguments is not\u2014as counsel for Fuel Petitioners \ncontended at oral argument, Oral Argument Transcript \n74\u201375\u2014that their standing arguments were sufficient \nwhen originally filed, but that their claims have been \nmooted by the passage of time. Fuel Petitioners\u2019 standing \narguments were deficient from the start.\n\n26a\nState Petitioners, meanwhile, argue that, to the \nextent that there is any doubt that they have met their \nburden of demonstrating causation and redressability, this \nCourt should resolve it in their favor given the \u201cspecial \nsolicitude\u201d to which states are entitled when they seek to \nprotect their \u201cquasi-sovereign interests.\u201d Massachusetts \nv. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 518\u201320, 127 S.\u00a0Ct. 1438, 167 L.\u00a0Ed.\u00a02d \n248 (2007); see also State Pet. Br. 16. We disagree. The \n\u201cspecial solicitude\u201d afforded to states can relax standing \nrequirements only so far. Massachusetts, 549 U.S. at 520. \nEven the \u201cgreater leeway\u201d afforded to states seeking to \nprotect quasi-sovereign interests cannot save defective \nstanding claims when, as here, the record is \u201calmost \ncompletely silent\u201d with respect to an element of a state\u2019s \nstanding. Alaska v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Agric., 17 F.4th 1224, \n1230, 454 U.S. App. D.C. 493 (D.C. Cir. 2021).\nState and Fuel Petitioners\u2019 sparse treatment of \nredressability is particularly surprising because, in a \nprevious case, this Court noted that it could not presume \nredressability in essentially the same circumstances. \nIn Chamber of Commerce of the United States v. EPA, \nthe Chamber of Commerce and the National Automobile \nDealers Association, on behalf of their automobile dealer \nmembers, petitioned for review in this Court of the EPA\u2019s \ndecision to grant California a waiver, under Section 209(b), \nwith respect to automobile Model Years 2009 through 2016. \n642 F.3d at 196\u201397. There, the petitioners\u2014automobile \ndealers who, like the Petitioners in this case, were not \ndirectly subject to the waiver\u2014explained that automobile \nmanufacturers\u2019 responses to the waiver injured them in \ntwo ways. First, automobile manufacturers would respond \n\n27a\nto the waiver by altering the mix of vehicles they sold in \nCalifornia and other states; as a result, vehicle dealers \nwould be injured because they would be unable to obtain \nspecific vehicles that their customers wanted to buy. Id. at \n201. And second, the California standards would increase \nautomobile manufacturers\u2019 costs and, in turn, increase \nthe prices of the automobiles they manufactured. Id. The \nautomobile dealers believed they would be injured by those \nincreased vehicle costs because they would have to choose \nwhether to keep their prices the same, and accordingly \nlower their profit margins, or to increase their prices \nto account for the increased vehicle costs, at the risk of \nturning away customers. Id.\nThe Chamber of Commerce Court ultimately resolved \npetitioners\u2019 claims on mootness grounds, not standing. \nId. at 204, 206. But before reaching that conclusion, the \nCourt expressed serious doubts that the petitioners \nhad met their burden of demonstrating redressability. \nId. at 205. The record before the Court indicated that \nvacatur of the challenged waiver may not result in any \nchange on the part of automobile manufacturers. And, \nthe Court noted, \u201cPetitioners ha[d] offered no evidence \nto the contrary, and no evidence that, if the waiver were \nvacated, [automobile manufacturers] would proceed on \na different course more favorable to the petitioners.\u201d Id. \nat 205\u201306. So even if petitioners\u2019 claims were not moot, \ntheir failure to introduce redressability evidence made \nit\u2014at a minimum\u2014rather unclear whether their claims \nwere redressable.\nAs the EPA and intervenors correctly recognize, \nState and Fuel Petitioners\u2019 standing submissions run into \n\n28a\nprecisely the same problem here. In its response brief, \nthe EPA explains in some detail how State Petitioners \nhave failed to substantiate the redressability of their \ninjuries. EPA Br. 26. California, meanwhile, argues that \nneither group of Petitioners has provided any evidence \nthat vacatur would remedy their injuries. California \nBr. 13. Further underlining the point, California offers \nan expert declaration by Joshua M. Cunningham, \nthe Chief of the Advanced Clean Cars Branch of the \nCalifornia Air Resources Board, who explains in \nspecific terms why the Petitioners\u2019 claims are unlikely \nto be redressed by a favorable decision by this Court. \nCalifornia Add. 84\u201385; 96\u201399. Cunningham explains that \nautomobile manufacturers have already made a number \nof public commitments regarding both vehicle pricing \nand availability with respect to the remaining model \nyears covered by the challenged waiver; those public \ncommitments would tend to suggest that neither group \nof Petitioners\u2019 claims are redressable. As Cunningham \nputs it, \u201cmanufacturers have likely already made pricing \ndecisions for\u201d the remaining model years. California \nAdd. 96. Cunningham also states that \u201cmanufacturers \nare already selling more qualifying vehicles in California \nthan the State\u2019s standards require,\u201d suggesting that \nvacatur of the zero-emission vehicle mandate would not \nredress Petitioners\u2019 injuries. California Add. 98. Indeed, \nrecord evidence supports the fact that manufacturers \nalready exceed California\u2019s ZEV requirements. See J.A. \n300\u201302. Yet despite these arguments against their theory \nof redressability, neither State nor Fuel Petitioners \nmeaningfully addressed the redressability of their \n\n29a\neconomic injuries in their reply briefs.9 State Pet. Reply \nBr. 3, Fuel Pet. Reply Br. 3\u20136.\nUltimately, the record evidence, coupled with the \nfilings of the EPA and intervenors, provide this Court \nwith no basis to conclude that Petitioners\u2019 claims are \nredressable\u2014a necessary element of standing that \nPetitioners bear the burden of establishing. As in Chamber \nof Commerce, \u201cPetitioners have offered no evidence to \nthe contrary, and no evidence that, if the waiver were \nvacated, [automobile manufacturers] would proceed on \na different course more favorable to the petitioners.\u201d \n642 F.3d at 205. Rather, both State and Fuel Petitioners \n\u201coffer only assertions, not facts, to support their claims \nabout the likely response\u201d of automobile manufacturers \nto a favorable decision by this Court. Crete Carrier Corp., \n363 F.3d at 494. But \u201c[s]peculative and unsupported \nassumptions regarding the future actions of third-party \nmarket participants are insufficient to establish Article \nIII standing.\u201d Id. 10 Petitioners may not proclaim that their \n9.\u2002 This Court denied a motion by State Petitioners to file with \ntheir reply brief new evidence regarding their standing.

That proposed supplemental evidence, however, \nconcerned only State Petitioners\u2019 allegations of economic injuries \nstemming from the waiver, not the redressability of those injuries. \nECF 2019756. At any rate, the evidence was too late. See D.C. Cir. \nR. 28(a)(7).\n10.\u2002 We conclude that Petitioners have failed to introduce \nsufficient evidence to raise a dispute of fact as to whether changes \nto the remaining model year fleets are substantially likely if \nvacatur were to occur, so we have no need to refer this to a district \njudge or special master as a disputed factual issue for resolution \nbefore making our ruling on redressability. See FCC v. ITT World \n\n30a\ninjuries are redressable and expect this Court to take \nthem at their word. On this record, redressability poses \na \u201cfatal stumbling block\u201d for both sets of Petitioners. Cato \nInstitute v. SEC, 4 F.4th 91, 95, 453 U.S. App. D.C. 184 \n(D.C. Cir. 2021). We accordingly hold that both State and \nFuel Petitioners lack standing premised on their economic \ninjuries because they have failed to meet their burdens of \ndemonstrating that their claims are redressable.\nC.\nAfter oral argument, Fuel Petitioners filed a motion \nto supplement the record and to file a supplemental brief \nregarding their standing. Fuel Pet. Mot. to Supp. 1. Fuel \nPetitioners contend that the EPA and California raised for \nthe first time at oral argument the question whether Fuel \nPetitioners\u2019 claims could be redressed within the relevant \nmodel years\u2014an issue Fuel Petitioners argue pertains \nto mootness, not the redressability of their claims. Fuel \nPet. Mot. to Supp. 1\u20132. Fuel Petitioners argue that they \nshould be allowed to file new evidence with this Court to \n\u201caddress that new argument.\u201d Fuel Pet. Mot. to Supp. 1.\nWe deny Fuel Petitioners\u2019 motion to supplement \nthe record and to file a supplemental brief. As we have \nexplained, a petitioner must generally demonstrate \nstanding in its opening brief, either by \u201cciting any record \nevidence relevant to its claim of standing\u201d or, where \nnecessary, by \u201cappending to its filing additional affidavits \nCommc\u2019ns, Inc., 466 U.S. 463, 469, 104 S.\u00a0Ct. 1936, 80 L.\u00a0Ed.\u00a02d 480 \n(1984) (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02347(b)(3)); Fed.

This \nCourt has, on rare occasion, accepted late affidavits or \nother evidence in support of standing for \u201cgood cause\u201d \nshown. Am. Libr. Ass\u2019n v. FCC, 401 F.3d 489, 495\u201396, 365 \nU.S. App. D.C. 207 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (quoting Sierra Club, \n292 F.3d at 900); Nat\u2019l Council for Adoption v. Blinken, 4 \nF.4th 106, 112, 453 U.S. App. D.C. 199 (D.C. Cir. 2021). We \nhave found \u201cgood cause\u201d when, for example, \u201c\u2019the parties \nreasonably, but mistakenly, believed\u2019 that they \u2018sufficiently \ndemonstrated standing\u2019 or when they \u2018reasonably assumed \nthat their standing was self-evident.\u2019\u201d Nat\u2019l Council for \nAdoption, 4 F.4th at 111 (quoting Twin Rivers Paper Co. \nLLC v. SEC, 934 F.3d 607, 614, 443 U.S. App. D.C. 74 (D.C. \nCir. 2019)).\nNo such good cause exists here. We do not think Fuel \nPetitioners could have reasonably believed that they had \nadequately demonstrated standing or that their standing \nwas \u201cself-evident\u201d from the record when they filed their \nopening brief. Twin Rivers, 934 F.3d at 614. As this \nCourt and the Supreme Court have repeatedly explained, \nredressability is \u201c\u2019substantially more difficult\u2019 to establish\u201d \nwhen, as here, Petitioners are not directly regulated by \nthe government action they seek to challenge. Lujan, 504 \nU.S. at 562 (quoting Allen, 468 U.S. at 758). Indeed, as \nnoted above, this Court has previously expressed doubt \nthat petitioners seeking to challenge a Section 209 waiver \nhad demonstrated redressability where they had failed to \nput any such evidence in the record. Chamber of Com., 642 \nF.3d at 205. And Fuel Petitioners should have been aware \nthat redressability may pose a particularly challenging \nobstacle here, considering the relatively narrow \n\n32a\ntimeframe of the particular waiver Petitioners challenge \nand the evidence in the record showing that automobile \nmanufacturers generally require years of lead time to \nmake changes to their future model year fleets. Yet Fuel \nPetitioners failed to meaningfully address redressability \nin their opening brief at all, either by \u201cidentify[ing] .\u00a0.\u00a0. \nrecord evidence\u201d or by offering the Court evidence of their \nown. Sierra Club, 292 F.3d at 899.\nSecond, even if Fuel Petitioners reasonably believed \nthat their standing was \u201cself-evident\u201d when they filed their \nopening brief, Petitioners offer no explanation for having \nfailed to address redressability in their reply brief after \nCalifornia raised the issue in its opposition brief. Twin \nRivers, 934 F.3d at 614. In this respect, Fuel Petitioners\u2019 \nmotion relies on a false premise: Oral argument was \nplainly not the first time that California argued that \nFuel Petitioners had failed to demonstrate redressability. \nRather, as we have explained, California explicitly argued \nthat Fuel Petitioners had offered no evidence regarding \nthe redressability of their injuries, and California \nprovided the Court with a declaration that addressed \nthe point. Having failed even to attempt to respond to \nCalifornia\u2019s arguments regarding redressability at the \nreply stage, Fuel Petitioners provide this Court with no \nreason to allow them to do so now.\nIII.\nState Petitioners also argue that the EPA\u2019s 2022 \ndecision is \u201ccontrary to constitutional right\u201d under 5 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0706(2)(B) because Section 209(b) of the Clean Air \n\n33a\nAct is unconstitutional. They rely on the equal sovereignty \nprinciple, which the Supreme Court applied in Shelby \nCounty v. Holder, 570 U.S. 529, 133 S.\u00a0 Ct. 2612, 186 \nL.\u00a0Ed.\u00a02d 651 (2013), to hold that Fifteenth Amendment \nlegislation that disparately impacts states\u2019 control over \nvoting procedures must be \u201csufficiently related to the \nproblem it targets.\u201d Id. at 542 (quoting Nw. Austin Mun. \nUtil. Dist. No. One v. Holder, 557 U.S. 193, 203, 129 S.\u00a0Ct. \n2504, 174 L.\u00a0Ed.\u00a02d 140 (2009)). State Petitioners argue \nthat this principle also categorically prohibits Congress \nfrom using its Commerce Clause power in a way that \nwithdraws sovereign authority from some states but not \nothers. And Section 209(b), they say, violates that principle \nby preempting the authority of every state but California \nto regulate motor vehicle emissions. We conclude that \nState Petitioners have standing to raise this constitutional \nclaim, but we join the two other circuits to have considered \nthe issue in rejecting State Petitioners\u2019 request to extend \nthe equal sovereignty principle in this fashion. See NCAA \nv. Governor of New Jersey, 730 F.3d 208, 239 (3d Cir. 2013), \nabrogated on other grounds by Murphy v. NCAA, 584 U.S. \n453, 138 S.\u00a0Ct. 1461, 200 L.\u00a0Ed.\u00a02d 854 (2018); Mayhew v. \nBurwell, 772 F.3d 80, 95 (1st Cir. 2014).\nA.\nTo assess State Petitioners\u2019 standing for this \nconstitutional claim, we again \u201cassume that on the merits\u201d \npetitioners \u201cwould be successful.\u201d City of Waukesha v. \nEPA, 320 F.3d 228, 235, 355 U.S. App. D.C. 100 (D.C. Cir. \n2003). Assuming State Petitioners\u2019 constitutional theory \nis correct, Section 209(b) and the EPA\u2019s 2022 decision \n\n34a\nviolate their constitutionally protected interest in equal \nsovereignty by leaving them with less regulatory authority \nover vehicle emissions than California. This claimed \ninjury is akin to the type of dignitary injury recognized \nin equal protection cases. Heckler v. Mathews, 465 U.S. \n728, 739\u201340, 104 S.\u00a0Ct. 1387, 79 L.\u00a0Ed.\u00a02d 646 (1984). And, \nState Petitioners argue, invalidating the decision would \nredress that injury and restore their sovereign equality \nby removing California\u2019s greater authority.\nRespondents resist that analysis on the ground that \nState Petitioners do not ask this court to increase their \nown sovereign authority over motor vehicle emissions. \nThe States instead seek to reduce California\u2019s authority.\nThe Supreme Court has repeatedly held, however, that \nthis type of \u201cleveling down\u201d remedy is sufficient to support \nstanding when a party asserts a constitutional right to \nequality. As the Court has put it, \u201cwhen the \u2018right invoked \nis that to equal treatment,\u2019 the appropriate remedy \nis a mandate of equal treatment, a result that can be \naccomplished by withdrawal of benefits from the favored \nclass as well as by extension of benefits to the excluded \nclass.\u201d Heckler, 465 U.S. at 740 (quoting Iowa-Des Moines \nNat\u2019l Bank v. Bennett, 284 U.S. 239, 247, 52 S.\u00a0Ct. 133, 76 \nL.\u00a0Ed. 265 (1931)); see also Sessions v.

But Respondents \nhave not identified\u2014and we do not perceive\u2014any material \nreason to treat the right to equal sovereignty claimed here \n\n35a\nany differently for standing purposes.11 And under the \nlogic of the Equal Protection cases, holding Section 209(b) \nunconstitutional and vacating the waiver would redress the \nclaimed constitutional injury by leaving all states equally \npositioned, in that none could regulate vehicle emissions. \nAccordingly, unlike with their asserted economic injuries, \nState Petitioners\u2019 asserted constitutional injury can be \nredressed even absent evidence that manufacturers will \nchange their plans before the waiver expires.12\n11.\u2002 Although we find State Petitioners\u2019 claimed dignitary \nharm sufficiently analogous in kind for purposes of standing, we do \nnot suggest that this harm is commensurate with equal protection \ninjuries based on the perpetuation of \u201carchaic and stereotypic \nnotions\u201d and stigmatization of members \u201cof [a] disfavored group as \n\u2018innately inferior.\u2019\u201d Heckler, 465 U.S. at 739 (quoting Miss.

As the Supreme Court has repeatedly \nheld, standing \u201cis not dispensed in gross; rather, plaintiffs must \ndemonstrate standing for each claim that they press and for each \nform of relief that they seek.\u201d TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 \nU.S. 413, 431, 141 S.\u00a0Ct. 2190, 210 L.\u00a0Ed.\u00a02d 568 (2021); see also, e.g., \nDaimlerChrysler Corp. v.

We are aware of \nno precedent or rationale that would allow parties to bring claims \nover which we otherwise would lack jurisdiction\u2014such as State \nPetitioners\u2019 statutory preemption claim\u2014by appending another \nclaim subject to a different standing analysis.\n\n36a\nB.\nTurning to the merits, we reject State Petitioners\u2019 \ntheory. The Supreme Court has held that the Constitution \ncontains a \u201cfundamental principle of equal sovereignty.\u201d \nShelby County, 570 U.S. at 544. But neither the Supreme \nCourt nor any other court has ever applied that principle as \na limit on the Commerce Clause or other Article I powers. \nAs explained below, the rationale of Shelby County and the \ncases on which it relied in fact suggests that the principle \nimposes no such limit. The parties\u2019 remaining arguments \nconfirm that conclusion. We therefore hold that Section \n209(b) is subject to traditional rational basis review for \nCommerce Clause legislation and\u2014as no one disputes\u2014\nthat it is constitutional under that standard.\nShelby County addressed the constitutionality of the \nVoting Rights Act\u2019s (\u201cVRA\u201d) coverage formula, which \nrequired some but not all states to obtain approval from \nfederal authorities before enacting voting-related laws, a \nprocess known as preclearance. Id. at 536\u201337. The Court \ndid not disturb South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. \n301, 86 S.\u00a0Ct. 803, 15 L.\u00a0Ed.\u00a02d 769 (1966), which held that \nthe coverage formula in the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was \nconstitutional because it was \u201crational in both practice \nand theory.\u201d Shelby County, 570 U.S. at 550 (quoting \nKatzenbach, 383 U.S. at 330); see also id. at 550\u201351 \n(discussing the exceptional circumstances that supported \nKatzenbach\u2019s conclusion). Instead, the core question in \nShelby County was whether Congress had sufficient \njustification for continuing to subject those states to the \npreclearance requirement in its 2006 reauthorization of \n\n37a\nthe Voting Rights Act. Id. The Supreme Court relied in \npart on the \u201cfundamental principle of equal sovereignty,\u201d \nid. at 544, to hold that the VRA\u2019s coverage formula was \nunconstitutional because it was founded on \u201cdecades-old \ndata and eradicated practices,\u201d id. at 551, instead of being \ntailored to \u201ccurrent conditions,\u201d id. at 557. The Court did \nnot outright reject the coverage formula for treating states \ndifferently; instead, it held that the formula\u2019s \u201cdisparate \ngeographic coverage\u201d was not \u201csufficiently related to \nthe problem that it targets.\u201d Id. at 550\u201351 (quoting Nw. \nAustin, 557 U.S. at 203).\nState Petitioners do not ask us to apply Shelby \nCounty\u2019s test that a statute\u2019s \u201cdisparate geographic \ncoverage\u201d must be \u201csufficiently related to the problem that \nit targets.\u201d State Pet.

Instead, State Petitioners rely on Shelby \nCounty to argue that the equal sovereignty principle \noperates as a categorical bar on Congress\u2019s Commerce \nClause authority\u2014that is, that the principle prohibits \nCongress from enacting Commerce Clause legislation \nthat leaves some states with more sovereign authority \nthan others, regardless of Congress\u2019s reasons for doing \nso.

First, \nthe central debate in Shelby County was the scope of \nCongress\u2019s power to enforce the Fifteenth Amendment \n\u201cby appropriate legislation.\u201d 570 U.S. at 536 (quoting U.S. \nConst. amend. XV). The Court used equal sovereignty \nas a background principle in applying that phrase. Id. \nat 544\u201345. State Petitioners confirm that textual link in \ntheir brief to us, arguing that Shelby County means that \n\u201cin deciding whether such legislation was \u2018appropriate,\u2019 \ncourts must consult the background principle of equal \nsovereignty.\u201d State Pet. Br. 24.\nBut unlike the Fifteenth Amendment, Congress\u2019s \nCommerce Clause power is not limited to \u201cappropriate \nlegislation.\u201d The Commerce Clause instead declares \nunconditionally that Congress has the power \u201cto regulate \ncommerce with foreign nations, among states, and with \nthe Indian tribes.\u201d U.S. Const. art. I \u00a7\u00a08, cl. 3. As the \nSupreme Court has explained, the Commerce Clause is \n\u201ca grant of plenary authority to Congress,\u201d Hodel v. Va. \nempowers only a single State (or a single subset of States) to regulate \na matter of unique concern to that State (or that subset of States),\u201d \nsuch as if Congress were to allow just one state to regulate a mineral \nthat exists only in that state. State Pet. Br. 26\u201327. Such a law would \nfit with State Petitioners\u2019 categorical theory because it would not \n\u201cdeny sovereign authority to any State capable of exercising it.\u201d State \nPet. Reply Br. 14. As the example indicates, this suggestion is not \nsubstantively different from the theory that the equal sovereignty \nprinciple imposes a categorical limit on Congress\u2019s Commerce Clause \nauthority, and we therefore do not address it separately.\n\n39a\nSurface Mining & Reclamation Ass\u2019n, 452 U.S. 264, 276, \n101 S.\u00a0Ct. 2352, 69 L.\u00a0Ed.\u00a02d 1 (1981), and \u201cacknowledges \nno limitations\u201d other than those \u201cprescribed in the \nconstitution\u201d and \u201cexpressed in plain terms,\u201d Gibbons v. \nOgden, 22 U.S. 1, 196, 6 L.\u00a0Ed. 23 (1824).\nSecond, in requiring that the VRA\u2019s coverage formula \nbe sufficiently related to the problem it targets, Shelby \nCounty repeatedly emphasized that the VRA was \n\u201cextraordinary,\u201d 570 U.S. at 536, because it intruded on \nstates\u2019 power to regulate elections, a \u201csensitive area of \nstate and local policymaking,\u201d id. at 545 (quoting Lopez \nv. Monterey County, 525 U.S. 266, 282, 119 S.\u00a0Ct. 693, \n142 L.\u00a0Ed.\u00a02d 728 (1999)), which \u201cthe Framers of the \nConstitution intended the States to keep for themselves,\u201d \nid. at 543 (quoting Gregory v.

Because the VRA departed from \nthe traditional balance of state and federal power over \nelections, the Court required a heightened showing that \nsubjecting specific states to the preclearance requirement \nwas still \u201cappropriate\u201d considering the nation\u2019s current \nconditions. Id. at 555.\nSection 209(b) is not \u201cextraordinary\u201d in that way. The \nConstitution places regulation of all matters affecting \ninterstate commerce\u2014including vehicle emissions\u2014\nsquarely within Congress\u2019s domain, not that of the states. \nSee Miss. Comm\u2019n on Env\u2019t Quality v. EPA, 790 F.3d 138, \n180\u201383, 416 U.S. App. D.C. 69 (D.C. Cir. 2015); see also \nMassachusetts, 549 U.S. at 528\u201329. Indeed, in discussing \n\n40a\nthe Constitution\u2019s assignment to Congress of control over \ninterstate commerce the Court has stressed that \u201c[n]o other \nfederal power was so universally assumed to be necessary\u201d \nand \u201cno other state power was so readily relinquished.\u201d \nH.

Accordingly, no one \nquestions that Congress could readily preempt all states \nfrom regulating motor vehicle emissions, or that Congress \nitself could set different vehicle emissions standards for \ndifferent regions of the country. See Sec\u2019y of Agric. v. Cent. \nRoig Refin.

Shelby County does not support requiring a \nheightened justification for disparate intrusions into \nareas over which the Constitution grants Congress such \ncomprehensive control. As the Third Circuit put it, \u201cthere \nis nothing in Shelby County to indicate that the equal \nsovereignty principle is meant to apply with the same force \noutside the context of \u2018sensitive areas of state and local \npolicymaking.\u2019\u201d NCAA, 730 F.3d at 239 (quoting Shelby \nCounty, 570 U.S. at 545).\nFurther, State Petitioners ask us not only to venture \nbeyond the bounds Shelby County set for the equal \nsovereignty principle but also to dramatically increase \nits force. Recall that Shelby County did not establish \na categorical bar against Congress leaving states \nwith different levels of sovereign authority even in the \ntraditionally state-dominated context of voting; it required \nonly that Congress show the disparate treatment is \n\n41a\n\u201csufficiently related to the problem that it targets.\u201d 570 \nU.S. at 550\u201351 (quoting Nw. Austin, 557 U.S. at 204). \nIndeed, the Court reaffirmed Katzenbach\u2019s holding that \nCongress could do so with sufficient evidence. Id.

State Pet. Br. 28\u201329; State Pet. Reply Br. \n10\u201311. Given that the Constitution grants Congress \nprimacy over interstate commerce, that would be a highly \ncounterintuitive conclusion.\nState Petitioners also rely on a series of cases known \nas the equal footing cases, which Shelby County cited as \napplying the equal sovereignty principle. See 570 U.S. \nat 544. Those cases involved congressional attempts to \nplace limits on new states as a condition of admission \nto the Union and identified \u201cequal sovereignty\u201d as an \n\u201cattribute .\u00a0.\u00a0. guaranteed to\u201d each state \u201cupon admission.\u201d \nUnited States v.

Id. at 567\u201368. The Court\u2019s opinion \naddressed whether Congress\u2019s power to admit new \nstates into the Union allowed such a condition, which was \nconcededly beyond any of Congress\u2019s other enumerated \npowers. Id. The Court explained that Congress could not \nuse its admission power to require a new state to give up \n\n42a\nan aspect of sovereignty that the thirteen original states \nretained. Id. To do so, the Court concluded, would create \na \u201cunion of states unequal in power, as including states \nwhose powers were restricted only by the Constitution, \nwith others whose powers had been further restricted by \nan act of Congress accepted as a condition of admission.\u201d \nId. at 567. State Petitioners here seize on that and similar \nlanguage to support their argument that the equal \nsovereignty principle must mean Congress generally has \nno power to legislate in ways that leave the states with \nunequal sovereign authority.\nThe equal footing cases, however, do not directly \napply either outside of the admission context or to Article \nI powers like the Commerce Clause. Shelby County \nitself reaffirmed prior holdings that the doctrine is not \na \u201cbar on differential treatment outside th[e] context\u201d of \nstates\u2019 admission into the Union. 570 U.S. at 544. Shelby \nCounty, of course, drew on the equal footing cases and \nconcluded that the principle of equal sovereignty they \ndiscuss remained \u201chighly pertinent\u201d in the context of that \ncase. Id. But for all the reasons explained above, Shelby \nCounty does not extend the principle even further to any \n(let alone all) Article I legislation.\nThe equal footing cases themselves also support that \nconclusion. Those cases contemplated\u2014though, to be \nsure, only in dicta\u2014that even if Congress treated states \ndifferently at the time of admission, it would not violate \nthe equal footing guarantee so long as it acted within the \nscope of its plenary powers over interstate commerce. \nThe Court suggested in Coyle that Congress could treat \nstates differently if\u2014instead of using its admission \n\n43a\npower\u2014it enacted \u201clegislation intended as a regulation \nof commerce,\u201d because to do that would be acting \u201cwithin \nthe sphere of the plain power of Congress.\u201d 221 U.S. at \n574; see also id. at 572\u201374; Pollard v. Hagan, 44 U.S. 212, \n229\u201330, 11 L.\u00a0Ed. 565 (1845). Such a condition would not \nput states on an impermissibly unequal footing because it \n\u201cwould not operate to restrict the state\u2019s legislative power \nin respect of any matter which was not plainly within the \nregulating power of Congress.\u201d Coyle, 221 U.S. at 574. \nAccordingly, the equal footing cases fit neatly with the \nconclusion that the equal sovereignty principle is not a \ncategorical bar on Congress deploying its plenary power \nover interstate commerce in ways that differentially affect \nstates\u2019 legislative power.\nThe parties also debate whether State Petitioners\u2019 \ntheory is supported by the Constitution\u2019s text, founding \nera history, and law of nations principles. We address \neach in turn and conclude these other indicators of \nconstitutional meaning do not support State Petitioners\u2019 \ntheory.\nThe Constitution does not contain any textual provision \nsuggesting an equal sovereignty limit on Congress\u2019s \nArticle I powers generally or on the Commerce Clause in \nparticular. As already discussed, the Commerce Clause \nis a plenary grant of authority to regulate interstate \ncommerce which the Supreme Court has held is subject \nonly to those limitations \u201cprescribed in the constitution\u201d \nand \u201cexpressed in plain terms.\u201d Gibbons, 22 U.S. at 196.\nTo the extent the Constitution\u2019s text sheds light on \nthe question, it appears to cut against State Petitioners, \n\n44a\nbecause the Constitution does impose certain equality-\nbased limitations on other Article I powers. For example, \nthe text of Article I, Section 8 states that laws concerning \nbankruptcy, naturalization, and duties shall be \u201cuniform.\u201d \nSee U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7\u00a08, cl. 1, cl. 4. Similarly, Article \nI, Section 9 prohibits \u201c[p]reference .\u00a0 .\u00a0 . given by any \nRegulation of Commerce or Revenue to the Ports of one \nState over those of another.\u201d U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7\u00a09, cl. 6. \nState Petitioners argue that these textual provisions do \nnot suggest the absence of a general equal sovereignty \nlimit on Article I. As they point out, these provisions speak \nonly to whether Congress can treat states differently \nwhen Congress itself does the legislating, not whether \nCongress can allow some but not other states to exercise \nthe sovereign authority to legislate on an issue. That is, the \nprovisions guarantee the states equal treatment for only \nspecific subjects rather than equal sovereignty for only \nthose subjects. The key for present purposes, however, \nis that even though the Founders plainly knew how to \ninclude equality-based protections for states in Article I \nwhen they wished to, they did not include any mention of \nState Petitioners\u2019 broad equal sovereignty principle. The \nfact that some constitutional clauses explicitly contain an \nequality-based guarantee therefore supports a negative \ninference\u2014though perhaps only a mild one\u2014that the \nCommerce Clause is not so constrained.\nThere are, of course, \u201cconstitutional doctrines \nthat are not spelled out in the Constitution but are \nnevertheless implicit in its structure and supported by \nhistorical practice,\u201d such as the doctrine of state sovereign \nimmunity. Franchise Tax Bd. v. Hyatt, 139 S.\u00a0Ct. 1485, \n\n45a\n1498\u201399, 203 L.\u00a0Ed.\u00a02d 768 (2019). That category also \nincludes limits on the Commerce Clause, such as the Tenth \nAmendment anticommandeering doctrine, which are \nsupported by the historical context in which our federal \nstructure was created. See New York v. United States, \n505 U.S. 144, 163\u201366, 112 S.\u00a0Ct. 2408, 120 L.\u00a0Ed.\u00a02d 120 \n(1992) (discussing founding era debates supporting the \nanticommandeering doctrine). The evidence the parties \nprovide from the founding era, however, does not show \nthat State Petitioners\u2019 version of the equal sovereignty \nprinciple has a comparable historical pedigree. It is true, \nas State Petitioners urge, that the general subject of state \nsovereignty and the states\u2019 relation to each other and the \nnew federal government was a core focus at the founding. \nDespite that focus, however, State Petitioners have \nidentified no evidence that the Founders contemplated the \ntype of inviolable equal state sovereignty State Petitioners \nask us to announce.\nThe equal sovereignty debate at the founding centered \non how states would be represented in Congress, with the \nsmaller states arguing for equal representation for each \nstate and the larger states seeking \u201cequality for each \nvoter\u201d in the form of proportional representation. See \nWesberry v. Sanders, 376 U.S. 1, 11-14, 84 S.\u00a0Ct. 526, 11 \nL.\u00a0Ed.\u00a02d 481 (1964) (summarizing the Great Compromise \ndebates); Letter from James Madison to Thomas Jefferson \n(Oct. 24, 1787), in 12 The Papers of Thomas Jefferson \n270, 279 (Julian P. Boyd ed., 1955) (discussing how the \n\u201clittle States insisted on retaining their equality in both \nbranches\u201d while the \u201clarge states .\u00a0.\u00a0. urged that as the \nnew Government was to be drawn principally from the \n\n46a\npeople immediately\u201d). For example, New Jersey delegate \nWilliam Paterson used the concept of \u201cequal sovereignty\u201d \nto support his argument for a single legislative chamber \nwith an equal vote for each state. Wesberry, 376 U.S. at 11 \n(citing 3 The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, \nat 251 (Max Farrand ed., 1911)). Eventually, these debates \nled to the Great Compromise, which established two forms \nof equality central to Article I: \u201cequal sovereignty\u201d in \nthe Senate in the form of equal representation for each \nstate and equal representation for each voter in the \nHouse in the form of proportional representation. U.S. \nConst. art. I, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a02, 3; see also The Federalist No. 39, at \n255 (James Madison) (Jacob E. Cooke ed., 1961). The \nFounders\u2019 preoccupation with the manner and extent of \nstate equality under the Constitution also appears to have \nyielded the specific equality-based limits on Congress\u2019s \nlegislative authority discussed above. If the Constitution \nalso contained State Petitioners\u2019 fundamental yet unstated \nlimit on Congress\u2019s authority to legislate, one would expect \nample historical evidence of that limit at the founding. \nState Petitioners point us to none. Cf. New York, 505 U.S. \nat 163\u201366.\nIn fact, as State Petitioners admit, the Constitution \nincludes one provision that expressly allows Congress to \nenhance the sovereign authority of some states without \ngranting that authority equally to all states. State Pet. \nReply Br. 10. Article I, Section 10 provides that \u201cNo State \nshall, without the Consent of Congress, lay any Duty of \nTonnage, keep Troops, or Ships of War in time of Peace, \nenter into any Agreement or Compact with another \nState, or with a foreign Power.\u201d U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7\u00a010, \n\n47a\ncl. 3. That is, Congress has the power to grant individual \nstates greater authority to, for example, assess taxes and \neven enter compacts with foreign powers\u2014indisputably \nelements of \u201csovereignty\u201d\u2014without extending the same \nauthority to other states. See Wheeling, P. & C. Transp. \nCo. v. City of Wheeling, 99 U.S. 273, 283, 25 L.\u00a0Ed. 412 \n(1878) (\u201cTaxation, beyond all doubt, is the exercise of a \nsovereign power.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d); Cuyler v. Adams, 449 U.S. 433, \n440, 101 S.\u00a0Ct. 703, 66 L.\u00a0Ed.\u00a02d 641 (1981) (compacts \nnecessarily \u201ctend[] to the increase of political power\u201d \nfor the states (quoting U.S. Steel Corp. v. Multistate Tax \nComm\u2019n, 434 U.S. 452, 468, 98 S.\u00a0Ct. 799, 54 L.\u00a0Ed.\u00a02d \n682 (1978))). Early Congresses used Article I, Section 10 \nin this very manner, granting specific states legislative \nauthority to impose tonnage duties. See, e.g., Act of Feb. \n9, 1791, ch. 5, 1 Stat. 190 (consenting to Maryland statute \nimposing duty at Port of Baltimore); Act of Aug. 11, 1790, \nch. 43, 1 Stat. 184 (consenting to Georgia, Maryland, and \nRhode Island statutes imposing tonnage duties). If this \nprovision were\u2014as State Petitioners would have it\u2014a \nlimited exception to an otherwise generally applicable \nequal sovereignty guarantee implicit in the Constitution, \nwe would expect to see some founding era discussion \nof how the provision interacts with that broader equal \nsovereignty principle. Yet State Petitioners identify no \nevidence of that either.\nThe only affirmative support State Petitioners identify \nfor their theory comes from law of nations principles. \nThey argue that the Founders expected international \nlaw of nations principles to govern the states and that \nthose principles included a notion of equal sovereignty \n\n48a\nthat would render federal legislation unconstitutional if \nit treated states differently. State. Pet. Br. 18; State Pet. \nReply Br. 12 (\u201cAt the founding, the law of nations entitled \nall sovereigns to perfect equality.\u201d (internal quotation \nmarks omitted)). That argument is unpersuasive. \nInternational law contained no analog for the relation in \nour constitutional system between the federal government \nand the states, and so it would be surprising if the law of \nnations dictated limits on Congress\u2019s authority in relation \nto the states. And, as it turns out, the Supreme Court has \neffectively explained that the Constitution\u2019s Supremacy \nClause defeats State Petitioners\u2019 reasoning. In Gibbons, \nthe Court held that while states may have equal sovereign \nauthority to regulate commerce in the absence of federal \naction, that authority is \u201csubjected .\u00a0.\u00a0. to the superior \npower of Congress\u201d when Congress acts. 22 U.S. at 70. \nIndeed, the Gibbons Court cited the very same law of \nnations principles that State Petitioners rely on, but only \nto describe the relationship between the states when \nCongress has not acted pursuant to its commerce power. \nId. at 69\u201370. No case since Gibbons has said otherwise.\nThe nature and extent of equality between the states \nhas been a central debate throughout our country\u2019s \nhistory, from the founding to the admission of new \nstates and beyond. But State Petitioners point us to \nno meaningful support for their novel request to apply \nthe equal sovereignty principle as a categorical limit on \nCongress\u2019s power to regulate interstate commerce. The \nFirst and Third Circuits\u2014the only appellate courts to \nhave considered similar arguments\u2014have found Shelby \nCounty\u2019s discussion of the equal sovereignty principle \ninapplicable to Commerce Clause and Spending Clause \nlegislation for similar reasons. See NCAA, 730 F.3d at \n\n49a\n238\u201339 (Commerce Clause); Mayhew, 772 F.3d at 95 \n(Spending Clause).\nSection 209(b) is subject to the rational basis review \nnormally applied to Commerce Clause legislation. See \nHodel, 452 U.S. at 276\u201377. And because State Petitioners \npresent no argument that Section 209(b) or the waiver \nat issue cannot survive that review, we reject their \nconstitutional challenge.\nState Petitioners\u2019 request to set aside the \nAdministrator\u2019s decision on these grounds is denied.\nSo ordered. \n\n50a\nAPPENDIX B\nENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY\n[EPA-HQ-OAR-2021-0257; FRL-9325-01-OAR]\nCalifornia State Motor Vehicle Pollution Control \nStandards; Advanced Clean Car Program; \nReconsideration of a Previous Withdrawal of a \nWaiver of Preemption; Notice of Decision\nAGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency.\nACTION: Notice of decision.\nSUMMARY: The Environmental Protection Agency \n(EPA) has completed the reconsideration of its 2019 \naction withdrawing a 2013 Clean Air Act (CAA) waiver \nof preemption for California\u2019s greenhouse gas (GHG) \nemission standards and zero emission vehicle (ZEV) \nsale mandate, which are part of California\u2019s Advanced \nClean Car (ACC) program.

Statutory and Executive Order Reviews\n\n55a\nI.\t Executive Summary\nCAA section 209(a) generally preempts states from \nadopting emission control standards for new motor \nvehicles. But Congress created an important exception \nfrom preemption. Under CAA section 209(b), the State \nof California1 may seek a waiver of preemption, and EPA \nmust grant it unless the Agency makes one of three \nstatutory findings. California\u2019s waiver of preemption \nfor its motor vehicle emissions standards allows other \nStates to adopt and enforce identical standards pursuant \nto CAA section 177. Since the CAA was enacted, EPA \nhas granted California dozens of waivers of preemption, \npermitting California to enforce its own motor vehicle \nemission standards. \nOf particular relevance to this action, in 2013, EPA \ngranted California\u2019s waiver request for the state\u2019s \nAdvanced Clean Car (ACC) program (ACC program \nwaiver).2 California\u2019s ACC program includes both a \nLow Emission Vehicle (LEV) program, which regulates \ncriteria pollutants and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, \nas well as a Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) sales mandate. \nThese two requirements are designed to control smog- and \nsoot-causing pollutants and GHG emissions in a single \n1.\u2002  The CAA section 209(b) waiver is limited \u201cto any State \nwhich has adopted standards . . . for the control of emissions from \nnew motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines prior to March 30, \n1966,\u201d and California is the only State that had standards in place \nbefore that date. \u201cCalifornia\u201d and \u201cCalifornia Air Resources Board\u201d \n(CARB) are used interchangeably in certain instances in this notice \nwhen referring to the waiver process under section 209(b). \n2.\u2002  78 FR 2111 (January 9, 2013). \n\n56a\ncoordinated package of requirements for passenger cars, \nlight-duty trucks, and medium-duty passenger vehicles \n(as well as limited requirements related to heavy-duty \nvehicles). Between 2013 and 2019, twelve other States \nadopted one or both of California\u2019s standards as their own. \nBut in 2019, EPA partially withdrew this waiver as part of \na final action entitled \u201cThe Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient \n(SAFE) Vehicles Rule Part One: One National Program\u201d \n(SAFE 1), marking the first time the agency withdrew \na previously granted waiver.3 In addition, in the context \nof SAFE 1, EPA provided an interpretive view of CAA \nsection 177 asserting that other states were precluded \nfrom adopting California\u2019s GHG standards. \nAs Administrator of the Environmental Protection \nAgency (EPA), I am now rescinding EPA\u2019s 2019 actions in \nSAFE 1 that partially withdrew the ACC program waiver \nfor California\u2019s ACC program. I am rescinding these \nactions because (1) EPA\u2019s reconsideration of the waiver \nunder the particular facts and circumstances of this case \nwas improper; (2) EPA\u2019s reconsideration was based on a \nflawed interpretation of CAA section 209(b); (3) even under \nthat flawed interpretation, EPA misapplied the facts and \ninappropriately withdrew the waiver; (4) EPA erred in \nlooking beyond the statutory factors in CAA 209(b) to \naction taken by another agency under another statute to \njustify withdrawing the waiver; (5) that agency has also \nsince withdrawn the action EPA relied on in any event; \nand (6) EPA inappropriately provided an interpretive view \nof section 177.\n3.\u2002  84 FR 51310 (September 27, 2019). \n\n57a\nAs a result of this action, EPA\u2019s 2013 waiver for the \nACC program, specifically the waiver for California\u2019s GHG \nemission standards and ZEV sales mandate requirements \nfor model years (MYs) 2017 through 2025, comes back \ninto force.4 I am also rescinding the interpretive view set \nforth in SAFE 1 that States may not adopt California\u2019s \nGHG standards pursuant to CAA section 177 even if \nEPA has granted California a section 209 waiver for \nsuch standards. Accordingly, States may now adopt and \nenforce California\u2019s GHG standards so long as they meet \nthe requirements of Section 177, and EPA will evaluate \nany State\u2019s request to include those provisions in a SIP \nthrough a separate notice and comment process. \nSection II of this action contains a detailed history \nof EPA\u2019s waiver adjudications leading up to this action. \nIn summary, in 2012, CARB submitted the ACC waiver \nrequest to EPA, which included ample evidence of the \ncriteria pollution benefits of the GHG standards and the \nZEV sales mandate. As it had in all prior waiver decisions \nwith two exceptions (including SAFE 1), in considering the \nrequest EPA relied on its \u201ctraditional\u201d interpretation of \nsection 209(b)(1)(B), which examines whether California \n4.\u2002  In SAFE 1, EPA did not withdraw the entire 2013 waiver, but \ninstead only withdrew the waiver as it related to California\u2019s GHG \nemission standards and the ZEV sales mandate. The waiver for the \nlow-emission vehicle (LEV III) criteria pollutant standards in the \nACC program remained in place. EPA\u2019s reconsideration of SAFE \n1 and the impact on the ACC waiver therefore relates only to the \nGHG emission standards and the ZEV sales mandate, although \u201cACC \nprogram waiver\u201d is used in this document. This action rescinds the \nwaiver withdrawal in SAFE 1. In this decision, the Agency takes no \nposition on any impacts this decision may have on state law matters \nregarding implementation. \n\n58a\nneeds a separate motor vehicle program as a whole\u2014not \nspecific standards\u2014to address the state\u2019s compelling \nand extraordinary conditions. In 2013, EPA granted \nCalifornia\u2019s waiver request for its ACC program in full. \nIn 2018, however, EPA proposed to withdraw portions of \nits waiver granted in 2013 based on a new interpretation \nof section 209(b)(1)(B) that looked at whether the specific \nstandards (the GHG standards and ZEV sales mandate), as \nopposed to the program as a whole, continued to meet the \nsecond and third waiver prongs (found in sections 209(b)\n(1)(B) and (C)).5 In addition, EPA proposed to look beyond \nthe section 209(b) criteria to consider the promulgation of \na NHTSA regulation and pronouncements in SAFE 1 that \ndeclared state GHG emission standards and ZEV sales \nmandates preempted under EPCA. In 2019, after granting \nCARB a waiver for its ACC program in 2013 and after 12 \nstates had adopted all or part of the California standards \nunder section 177, EPA withdrew portions of the waiver \nfor CARB\u2019s GHG emission standards and ZEV sales \nmandates. In SAFE 1, EPA cited changed circumstances \nand was based on a new interpretation of the CAA and \nthe agency\u2019s reliance on an action by NHTSA that has \nnow been repealed.6 \n5.\u2002  EPA\u2019s 2018 proposal was jointly issued with the National \nHighway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). 83 FR 42986 \n(August 24, 2018) (the \u201cSAFE proposal\u201d). In addition to partially \nwithdrawing the waiver, that proposal proposed to set less stringent \ngreenhouse gas and CAFE standards for model years 2021-2026. \nNHTSA also proposed to make findings related to preemption under \nthe Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) and its relationship \nto state and local GHG emission standards and ZEV sales mandates. \n6.\u2002  84 FR 51310. In SAFE 1, NHTSA also finalized its action \nrelated to preemption under EPCA. NHTSA\u2019s action included both \n\n59a\nOn January 20, 2021, President Biden issued \nExecutive Order 13990, directing the Federal Agencies \nto \u201cimmediately review\u201d SAFE 1 and to consider action \n\u201csuspending, revising, or rescinding\u201d that action by \nApril 2021. On April 28, 2021, EPA announced its Notice \nof Reconsideration, including a public hearing and an \nopportunity for public comment.7 The Agency stated \nits belief that there were significant issues regarding \nwhether SAFE 1 was a valid and appropriate exercise \nof Agency authority, including the amount of time that \nhad passed since EPA\u2019s ACC program waiver decision, \nthe approach and legal interpretations used in SAFE 1, \nwhether EPA took proper account of the environmental \nconditions ( e.g., local climate and topography, number \nof motor vehicles, and local and regional air quality) in \nCalifornia, and the environmental consequences from \nthe waiver withdrawal in SAFE 1. Further, EPA stated \nit would be addressing issues raised in the related \npetitions for reconsideration of EPA\u2019s SAFE 1 action. \nIn the meantime, having reconsidered its own action, \nand also in response to Executive Order 13990, NHTSA \nrepealed its conclusion that state and local laws related \nregulatory text and well as pronouncements within the preamble \nof SAFE 1. In 2020, EPA finalized its amended and less stringent \ncarbon dioxide standards for the 2021-2026 model years in an action \ntitled \u201cThe Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles Rule for \nModel Years 2021-2026 Passenger Cars and Light Trucks\u201d (SAFE \n2). 85 FR 24174 (April 30, 2020). \n7.\u2002  \u201cCalifornia State Motor Vehicle Pollution Control Standards; \nAdvanced Clean Car Program; Reconsideration of a Previous \nWithdrawal of a Waiver of Preemption; Opportunity for Public \nHearing and Public Comment.\u201d 86 FR 22421 (April 28, 2021). \n\n60a\nto fuel economy standards, including GHG standards and \nZEV sales mandates, were preempted under EPCA,8 and \nEPA revised and made more stringent the Federal GHG \nemission standards for light-duty vehicles for 2023 and \nlater model years, under section 202(a).9 \nSection III of this action outlines the principles that \ngovern waiver reconsiderations. It sets forth the statutory \nbackground and context for the CAA preemption of \nnew motor vehicle emission standards, the criteria for \ngranting a waiver of preemption, and the ability of other \nStates to adopt and enforce California\u2019s new motor vehicle \nemission standards where a waiver has been issued if \ncertain CAA criteria are met. In brief, CAA section 209(a) \ngenerally preempts all States or political subdivisions \nfrom adopting and enforcing any standard relating to the \ncontrol of emissions from new motor vehicles or new motor \nvehicle engines. But section 209(b) contains an important \nexception that allows only California to submit a request \nto waive preemption for its standards. Importantly, \nEPA must grant the waiver unless the Administrator \nmakes at least one of three findings: (1) That California\u2019s \ndetermination that its standards will be, in the aggregate, \nat least as protective of public health and welfare as \napplicable Federal standards, is arbitrary and capricious \n(the \u201cfirst waiver prong,\u201d under section 209(b)(1)(A)); \n(2) that California does not need such State standards \nto meet compelling and extraordinary conditions (the \n\u201csecond waiver prong,\u201d under section 209(b)(1)(B)); or (3) \n8.\u2002  86 FR 74236 (December 29, 2021). \n9.\u2002  86 FR 74434 (December 30, 2021). \n\n61a\nthat California standards are not consistent with section \n202(a), which contains EPA\u2019s authority to regulate motor \nvehicles (the \u201cthird waiver prong,\u201d under section 209(b)(1)\n(C)). In the 1977 amendments to the CAA, section 177 was \nadded to allow other States that may be facing their own \nair quality concerns to adopt and enforce the California \nnew motor vehicle emission standards for which California \nhas been granted a waiver under section 209(b) if certain \ncriteria are met. \nSection III also provides more context to indicate that \nCongress intended that, when reviewing a request for a \nwaiver, EPA treat with deference the policy judgments on \nwhich California\u2019s vehicle emission standards are based. \nIt discusses the history of Congress allowing states to \nadopt more stringent standards. Ultimately, Congress \nbuilt a structure in section 209(b) that grants California \nauthority to address its air quality problems, and also \nacknowledges the needs of other states to address their \nair quality problems through section 177. Lastly, Section \nIII describes the burden and standard of proof for waiver \ndecisions.\nSection IV of this action then discusses EPA\u2019s first \nbasis for rescinding the SAFE 1 waiver withdrawal: That \nEPA did not appropriately exercise its limited authority \nto withdraw a waiver once granted. Section 209 does not \nprovide EPA with express authority to reconsider and \nwithdraw a waiver previously granted to California. EPA\u2019s \nauthority thus stems from its inherent reconsideration \nauthority. In the context of reconsidering a waiver grant, \nthat authority may only be exercised sparingly. EPA \n\n62a\nbelieves its inherent authority to reconsider a waiver \ndecision is constrained by the three waiver criteria that \nmust be considered before granting or denying a waiver \nrequest under section 209(b). EPA\u2019s reconsideration \nmay not be broader than the limits Congress placed on \nits ability to deny a waiver in the first place. EPA notes \nfurther support for limiting its exercise of reconsideration \nauthority, relevant in the context of a waiver withdrawal, \nis evidenced by Congress\u2019s creation of a state and federal \nregulatory framework to drive motor vehicle emissions \nreduction and technology innovation that depends for \nits success on the stable market signal of the waiver \ngrant\u2014automobile manufacturers must be able to depend \nreliably on the continuing validity of the waiver grant \nin order to justify the necessary investments in cleaner \nvehicle technology. Accordingly, EPA now believes it may \nonly reconsider a previously granted waiver to address a \nclerical or factual error or mistake, or where information \nshows that factual circumstances or conditions related to \nthe waiver criteria evaluated when the waiver was granted \nhave changed so significantly that the propriety of the \nwaiver grant is called into doubt. Even then, as with other \nadjudicatory actions, when choosing to undertake such a \nreconsideration EPA believes it should exercise its limited \nauthority within a reasonable timeframe and be mindful \nof reliance interests. EPA expects such occurrences will \nbe rare. The Agency\u2019s waiver withdrawal in SAFE 1 was \nnot an appropriate exercise of EPA\u2019s limited authority; \nthere was no clerical error or factual error in the ACC \nprogram waiver, and SAFE 1 did not point to any factual \ncircumstances or conditions related to the three waiver \nprongs that have changed so significantly that the \n\n63a\npropriety of the waiver grant is called into doubt. Rather, \nthe 2019 waiver withdrawal was based on a change in \nEPA\u2019s statutory interpretation, an incomplete assessment \nof the record, and another agency\u2019s action beyond the \nconfines of section 209(b). EPA erred in reconsidering a \npreviously granted waiver on these bases. Accordingly, \nEPA is rescinding its 2019 withdrawal of its 2013 ACC \nprogram waiver.\nSections V and VI further explain why, even if SAFE \n1 were an appropriate exercise of EPA\u2019s limited authority \nto reconsider its previously-granted waiver, the Agency \nwould still now rescind its waiver withdrawal.\nAs discussed in Section V, the Agency\u2019s reinterpretation \nof the second waiver prong in SAFE 1 was flawed. While \nEPA has traditionally interpreted the second waiver \nprong, section 209(b)(1)(B), to require a waiver unless \nthe Agency demonstrates that California does not \nneed its own motor vehicle emissions program, to meet \ncompelling and extraordinary conditions, the SAFE 1 \nwaiver withdrawal decision was based on a statutory \ninterpretation that calls for an examination of the need \nfor the specific standard at issue. Section V explains why \nEPA believes that its traditional interpretation is, at \nleast, the better interpretation of the second waiver prong \nbecause it is most consistent with the statutory language \nand supported by the legislative history. Accordingly, we \nreaffirm the traditional interpretation\u2014in which EPA \nreviews the need for California\u2019s motor vehicle program\u2014\nin this action.\n\n64a\nAdditionally, Section V explains why even if the \nfocus is on the specific standards, when looking at the \nrecord before it, EPA erred in SAFE 1 in concluding \nthat California does not have a compelling need for the \nspecific standards at issue\u2014the GHG emission standards \nand ZEV sales mandate. In particular, in SAFE 1, the \nAgency failed to take proper account of the nature and \nmagnitude of California\u2019s serious air quality problems, \nincluding the interrelationship between criteria and GHG \npollution.10 Section V further discusses EPA\u2019s improper \nsubstitution in SAFE 1 of its own policy preferences for \nCalifornia\u2019s, and discusses the importance of deferring to \nCalifornia\u2019s judgment on \u201cambiguous and controversial \nmatters of public policy\u201d that relate to the health and \nwelfare of its citizens.11 Based on a complete review of the \nrecord in this action, EPA now believes that, even under \nthe SAFE 1 interpretation, California needs the ZEV \nsales mandate and GHG standards at issue to address \ncompelling and extraordinary air quality conditions in \n10.\u2002  As explained herein, the requirements in the ACC program \nwere designed to work together in terms of the technologies that \nwould be used to both lower criteria emissions and GHG emissions. \nThe standards, including the ZEV sales mandate and the GHG \nemission standards, were designed to address the short- and long-\nterm air quality goals in California in terms of the criteria emission \nreductions (including upstream reductions) along GHG emission \nreductions. The air quality issues and pollutants addressed in the \nACC program are interconnected in terms of the impacts of climate \nchange on such local air quality concerns such as ozone exacerbation \nand climate effects on wildfires that affect local air quality. \n11.\u2002  40 FR 23102, 23104 (May 28, 1975); 58 FR 4166 (January \n13, 1993). \n\n65a\nthe state. EPA\u2019s findings in SAFE 1, which were based on \nthe Agency\u2019s inaccurate belief that these standards were \neither not intended to or did not result in criteria emission \nreductions to address California\u2019s National Ambient Air \nQuality Standard (NAAQS) obligations, are withdrawn. \nSection VI discusses SAFE 1\u2019s other basis for \nwithdrawing the ACC program waiver, EPCA. In SAFE \n1, EPA reached beyond the waiver criteria in section \n209(b)(1) and considered NHTSA\u2019s regulations in SAFE \n1 that state or local regulation of carbon dioxide emission \nfrom new motor vehicles (including California\u2019s ZEV sales \nmandate and GHG standards) are related to fuel economy \nand as such are preempted under EPCA. NHTSA has \nsince issued a final rule that repeals all regulatory text \nand additional pronouncements regarding preemption \nunder EPCA set forth in SAFE 1.12 This action by NHTSA \neffectively removes the underpinning and any possible \nreasoned basis for EPA\u2019s withdrawal decision based on \npreemption under EPCA in SAFE 1. Additionally, the \nAgency has historically refrained from consideration of \nfactors beyond the scope of the waiver criteria in section \n209(b)(1) and the 2013 ACC program waiver decision was \nundertaken consistent with this practice. EPA believes \nthat the consideration of EPCA preemption in SAFE 1 \nled the Agency to improperly withdraw the ACC program \nwaiver on this non-CAA basis. EPA\u2019s explanation that \nwithdrawal on this basis was justified because SAFE 1 \nwas a joint action, and its announcement that this would \nbe a single occurrence, does not justify the ACC waiver \n12\u2002  86 FR 74236. \n\n66a\nwithdrawal. Thus, EPA is rescinding the withdrawal of \nthose aspects of the ACC program waiver that were based \non NHTSA\u2019s actions in SAFE 1. \nSection VII addresses SAFE 1\u2019s interpretive view of \nsection 177 that States adopting California\u2019s new motor \nvehicle emission standards could not adopt California\u2019s \nGHG standards.13 EPA believes it was both unnecessary \nand inappropriate in a waiver proceeding to provide \nan interpretive view of the authority of states to adopt \nCalifornia standards when section 177 does not assign \nEPA any approval role in states\u2019 adoption of the standards. \nTherefore, as more fully explained in Section VII, the \nAgency is rescinding the interpretive view on section \n177 set out in SAFE 1. Section VIII discusses certain \nother considerations, including the equal sovereignty \ndoctrine and California\u2019s deemed-to-comply provision, \nand concludes that they do not disturb EPA\u2019s decision to \nrescind the 2019 waiver withdrawal action. \nSection IX contains the final decision to rescind \nthe withdrawal of the 2013 ACC program waiver. In \nsummary, I find that although EPA has inherent authority \nto reconsider its prior waiver decisions, that authority to \nreconsider is limited and may be exercised only when EPA \nhas made a clerical or factual error or mistake, or where \ninformation shows that factual circumstances or conditions \nrelated to the waiver criteria evaluated when the waiver \nwas granted have changed so significantly that the \npropriety of the waiver grant is called into doubt. Further, \n13.\u2002  84 FR at 51310, 51350. \n\n67a\nEPA\u2019s reconsideration may not be broader than the limits \nCongress placed on its ability to deny a waiver in the first \nplace. Even where those conditions are met, I believe that \nany waiver withdrawal decision should consider other \nfactors such as the length of time since the initial decision \nand California and others\u2019 reliance on the initial decision. \nBecause there were no factual or clerical errors or such \nsignificantly changed factual circumstances or conditions \nnecessary to trigger EPA\u2019s authority to reconsider its \npreviously granted waiver during the SAFE 1 proceeding, \nI believe SAFE 1 was not an appropriate exercise of \nEPA\u2019s authority to reconsider. In addition, even if it were \nan appropriate exercise, EPA should not have departed \nfrom its traditional interpretation of the second waiver \nprong (section 209(b)(1)(B)), which is properly focused on \nCalifornia\u2019s need for a separate motor vehicle emission \nprogram\u2014not specific standards\u2014to meet compelling and \nextraordinary conditions. And even under EPA\u2019s SAFE \n1 interpretation of the second waiver prong, a complete \nreview of the factual record demonstrates that California \ndoes need the GHG emission standards and ZEV sales \nmandate to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions \nin the State. Therefore, EPA should not have withdrawn \nthe ACC program waiver based upon the second waiver \nprong in SAFE 1 and recission of the withdrawal is \nwarranted. Additionally, I find that EPA inappropriately \nrelied on NHTSA\u2019s finding of preemption, now withdrawn, \nto support its waiver withdrawal, and rescind the waiver \nwithdrawal on that basis as well. Finally, independently \nin this action, I am rescinding the interpretive views of \nsection 177 that were set forth in SAFE 1, because it was \ninappropriate to include those views as part of this waiver \nproceeding.\n\n68a\nFor these reasons, I am rescinding EPA\u2019s part of \nSAFE 1 related to the CAA preemption of California\u2019s \nstandards. This recission has the effect of bringing the \nACC program waiver back into force.\nII.\t Background\nThis section provides background information needed \nto understand EPA\u2019s decision process in SAFE 1, and this \ndecision. This context includes: A summary of California\u2019s \nACC program including the record on the criteria pollutant \nbenefits of its ZEV sales mandate and GHG emission \nstandards; a review of the prior GHG emission standards \nwaivers in order to explain EPA\u2019s historical evaluation \nof the second waiver prong; an overview of the SAFE \n1 decision; a review of the petitions for reconsideration \nfiled subsequent to SAFE 1; and a description of the \nbases and scope of EPA\u2019s reconsideration of SAFE 1. \nEPA\u2019s sole purpose in soliciting public comment on its \nreconsideration was to determine whether SAFE 1 was a \nvalid and appropriate exercise of the Agency\u2019s authority. \nIn the Notice of Reconsideration, EPA therefore noted \nthat reconsideration was limited to SAFE 1 and that \nthe Agency was not reopening the ACC program waiver \ndecision.\nA.\t California\u2019s Advanced Clean Car (ACC) Program \nand EPA\u2019s 2013 Waiver\nOn June 27, 2012, CARB notified EPA of its adoption \nof the ACC program regulatory package that contained \namendments to its LEV III and ZEV sales mandate, and \nrequested a waiver of preemption under section 209(b) to \n\n69a\nenforce regulations pertaining to this program.14 The ACC \nprogram combined the control of smog- and soot-causing \npollutants and GHG emissions into a single coordinated \npackage of requirements for passenger cars, light-duty \ntrucks, and medium-duty passenger vehicles (as well as \nlimited requirements related to heavy-duty vehicles for \ncertain model years).15 \nIn its 2012 waiver request, CARB noted that the 2012 \nZEV amendments would also result in additional criteria \npollutant benefits in California in comparison to the \n14.\u2002  2012 Waiver Request, EPA-HQ-OAR-2012-0562-0004 (2012 \nWaiver Request) at 1, 3-6. CARB\u2019s LEV III standards include both \nits criteria emission standards and its GHG emission standards. \nSAFE 1 did not address the LEV III criteria emission standards \nand as such the ACC program waiver remained in place. SAFE \n1 did address CARB\u2019s GHG emission standards and ZEV sales \nmandate and this action addresses these two standards as well. \nAs noted in CARB\u2019s 2012 Waiver Request, these three standards \nare interrelated and comprehensive in order to address the State\u2019s \nserious air quality problems including its criteria pollutants and \nclimate change challenges. \n15.\u2002  As noted in CARB\u2019s waiver request, \u201c[a]t the December \n2009 hearing, the Board adopted Resolution 09-66, reaffirming \nits commitment to meeting California\u2019s long term air quality and \nclimate change reduction goals through commercialization of ZEV \ntechnologies. The Board further directed staff to consider shifting \nthe focus of the ZEV regulation to both GHG and criteria pollutant \nemission reductions, commercializing ZEVs and PHEVs in order to \nmeet the 2050 goals, and to take into consideration the new LEV fleet \nstandards and propose revisions to the ZEV regulation accordingly.\u201d \n2012 Waiver Request at 2 (emphasis added). EPA stated in SAFE \n1 that California\u2019s ZEV standard initially targeted only criteria \npollutants. 84 FR at 51329. See also 78 FR at 2118. \n\n70a\nearlier ZEV regulations and would likely provide benefits \nbeyond those achieved by complying with the LEV III \ncriteria pollutant standard for conventional vehicles only. \nCARB attributed these benefits not to vehicle emissions \nreductions specifically, but to increased electricity and \nhydrogen use that would be more than offset by decreased \ngasoline production and refinery emissions.16 CARB\u2019s \nwaiver request attributed the criteria emissions benefits \nto its LEV III criteria pollutant fleet standard and did \nnot include similar benefits from its ZEV sales mandate. \nAccording to the request, the fleet would become cleaner \nregardless of the ZEV sales mandate because the ZEV \nsales mandate is a way to comply with the LEV III \nstandards and, regardless of the ZEV sales mandate, \nmanufacturers might adjust their compliance response \nto the standard by making less polluting conventional \nvehicles. CARB further explained that because upstream \ncriteria and PM emissions are not captured in the LEV \nIII criteria pollutant standard, net upstream emissions \nare reduced through the increased use of electricity and \nconcomitant reductions in fuel production.17 \nOn August 31, 2012, EPA issued a notice of opportunity \nfor public hearing and written comment on CARB\u2019s \nrequest and solicited comment on all aspects of a full \nwaiver analysis for such request under the criteria \nof section 209(b).18 Commenters opposing the waiver \n16.\u2002  2012 Waiver Request at 6. \n17.\u2002  Id. at 15-16. \n18.\u2002  77 FR 53119 (August 31, 2012). \n\n71a\nasked EPA to deny the waiver under the second waiver \nprong, section 209(b)(1)(B), as it applied to the GHG \nprovisions in the ACC Program, calling on EPA to \nadopt an alternative interpretation of that provision \nfocusing on California\u2019s need for the specific standards. \nFollowing public notice and comment and based on its \ntraditional interpretation of section 209(b), on January \n9, 2013, EPA granted California\u2019s request for a waiver of \npreemption to enforce the ACC program regulations.19 \nThe traditional interpretation, which EPA stated is the \nbetter interpretation of section 209(b)(1)(B), calls for \nevaluating California\u2019s need for a separate motor vehicle \nemission program to meet compelling and extraordinary \nconditions.20 As explained, EPA must grant a waiver to \n19.\u2002  Set forth in the ACC program waiver decision is a summary \ndiscussion of EPA\u2019s earlier decision to depart from its traditional \ninterpretation of section 209(b)(1)(B) (the second waiver prong) in \nthe 2008 waiver denial for CARB\u2019s initial GHG standards for certain \nearlier model years along with EPA\u2019s return to the traditional \ninterpretation of the second prong in the waiver issued in 2009. 78 \nFR at 2125-31. These interpretations are discussed more fully in \nSection III. \n20.\u2002  Id. at 2128 (\u201cThe better interpretation of the text and \nlegislative history of this provision is that Congress did not intend \nthis criterion to limit California\u2019s discretion to a certain category \nof air pollution problems, to the exclusion of others. In this context \nit is important to note that air pollution problems, including local or \nregional air pollution problems, do not occur in isolation. Ozone and \nPM air pollution, traditionally seen as local or regional air pollution \nproblems, occur in a context that to some extent can involve long \nrange transport of this air pollution or its precursors. This long \nrange or global aspect of ozone and PM can have an impact on local \nor regional levels, as part of the background in which the local or \nregional air pollution problem occurs.\u201d). \n\n72a\nCalifornia unless the Administrator makes at least one of \nthe three statutorily-prescribed findings in section 209(b)\n(1). Concluding that opponents of the waiver did not meet \ntheir burden of proof to demonstrate that California does \nnot have such need, EPA found that it could not deny the \nwaiver under the second waiver prong.21 \nWithout adopting the alternative interpretation, \nEPA noted that, to the extent that it was appropriate to \nexamine the need for CARB\u2019s specific GHG standards \nto meet compelling and extraordinary conditions, EPA \nhad explained at length in its earlier 2009 GHG waiver \ndecision that California does have compelling and \nextraordinary conditions directly related to regulation \nof GHGs. This conclusion was supported by additional \nevidence submitted by CARB in the ACC program \nwaiver proceeding, including reports that demonstrate \nrecord-setting wildfires, deadly heat waves, destructive \nstorm surges, and loss of winter snowpack. Many of these \nextreme weather events and other conditions have the \npotential to dramatically affect human health and well-\n21.\u2002  Because EPA received comment on this issue during the \nACC program waiver proceeding, as it pertained to both CARB\u2019s \nGHG emission standards and ZEV sales mandate, the Agency \nrecounted the interpretive history associated with standards for \nboth GHG emissions and criteria air pollutants to explain EPA\u2019s \nbelief that section 209(b)(1)(B) should be interpreted the same \nway for all air pollutants. Id. at 2125-31 (\u201cAs discussed above, EPA \nbelieves that the better interpretation of the section 209(b)(1)(B) \ncriterion is the traditional approach of evaluating California\u2019s need \nfor a separate motor vehicle emission program to meet compelling \nand extraordinary conditions. Applying this approach with the \nreasoning noted above, with due deference to California, I cannot \ndeny the waiver.\u201d). \n\n73a\nbeing.22 Similarly, to the extent that it was appropriate to \nexamine the need for CARB\u2019s ZEV sales mandate, EPA \nnoted that the ZEV sales mandate in the ACC program \nenables California to meet both its air quality and climate \ngoals into the future. EPA recognized that CARB\u2019s \ncoordinated strategies reflected in the ACC program for \naddressing both criteria pollutants and GHGs and the \nmagnitude of the technology and energy transformation \nneeded to meet such goals.23 Therefore, EPA determined \nthat, to the extent the second waiver prong should be \ninterpreted to mean a need for the specific standards at \nissue, CARB\u2019s GHG emission standards and ZEV sales \nmandate satisfy such a finding. \nIn the context of assessing the need for the specific \nZEV sales mandate in the ACC program waiver, EPA \nnoted CARB\u2019s intent in the redesign of the ZEV regulation \n22.\u2002  Id. at 2126-29. Within the 2009 GHG waiver, and again in \nthe 2013 ACC program waiver, EPA explained that the traditional \napproach does not make section 209(b)(1)(B) a nullity, as EPA must \nstill determine whether California does not need its motor vehicle \nprogram to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions as \ndiscussed in the legislative history. Conditions in California may \none day improve such that it may no longer have a need for its motor \nvehicle program. \n23.\u2002  Id. at 2131 (\u201cWhether or not the ZEV standards achieve \nadditional reductions by themselves above and beyond the LEV III \nGHG and criteria pollutant standards, the LEV III program overall \ndoes achieve such reductions, and EPA defers to California\u2019s policy \nchoice of the appropriate technology path to pursue to achieve these \nemissions reductions. The ZEV standards are a reasonable pathway \nto reach the LEV III goals, in the context of California\u2019s longer-\nterm goals.\u201d). \n\n74a\nof addressing both criteria pollutants and GHG emissions, \nand CARB\u2019s demonstration of \u201cthe magnitude of the \ntechnology and energy transformation needed from the \ntransportation sector and associated energy production to \nmeet . . . the goals set forth by California\u2019s climate change \nrequirements\u201d and found that the ZEV standards would \nhelp California achieve those \u201clong term emission benefits \nas well as . . . some [short-term] reduction in criteria \npollutant emissions.\u201d24 \nB.\t Prior Waivers for GHG Standards\nFor over fifty years, EPA has evaluated California\u2019s \nrequests for waivers of preemption under section 209(b), \nprimarily considering CARB\u2019s motor vehicle emission \nprogram for criteria pollutants.25 More recently, the Agency \nhas worked to determine how section 209(b)(1)(B) should \nbe interpreted and applied to GHG standards, including \n24.\u2002  Id. at 2130-31.

Subsection (e) addresses the preemption \nof State or political subdivision regulation of emissions from nonroad \nengines or vehicles. Section 209(e)(2)(A) sets forth language similar \nto section 209(b) in terms of the criteria associated with EPA waiving \npreemption, in this instance for California nonroad vehicle and \nengine emission standards. Congress directed EPA to implement \nsubsection (e). See 40 CFR part 1074. EPA review of CARB requests \nsubmitted under section 209(e)(2)(A)(ii) includes consideration of \nwhether CARB needs its nonroad vehicle and engine program to \nmeet compelling and extraordinary conditions. See 78 FR 58090 \n(September 20, 2013). \n\n75a\nconsideration of the relationship of GHG standards to \nCalifornia\u2019s historical air quality problems, the public \nhealth impacts of GHG emissions on NAAQS pollutants, \nand the direct impacts of GHG emissions and climate \nchange on California and its inhabitants. While the SAFE \n1 withdrawal and revocation of the waiver for CARB\u2019s \nACC program represents a singular snapshot of this \ntask, it is important to examine EPA\u2019s long-standing and \nconsistent waiver practice in general, including EPA\u2019s \ninterpretations in prior waiver decisions pertaining to \nCARB\u2019s GHG emission standards, in order to determine \nwhether EPA properly applied the waiver criterion in \nsection 209(b)(1)(B) in SAFE 1.26 \nHistorically, EPA has consistently interpreted and \napplied the second waiver prong by considering whether \nCalifornia needed a separate motor vehicle emission \nprogram as compared to the specific standards at issue \nto meet compelling and extraordinary conditions.27 At the \nsame time, in response to commenters that have argued \nthat EPA is required to examine the specific standards \nat issue in the waiver request, EPA\u2019s practice has been to \nnevertheless review the specific standards to determine \nwhether California needs those individual standards to \nmeet compelling and extraordinary conditions.28 This \n26.\u2002  EPA notes that, in the history of EPA waiver decisions, \nit has only denied a waiver once (in 2008) and withdrawn a waiver \nonce (in 2019). Each instance was under this second waiver prong \nin section 209(b)(1)(B). \n27.\u2002  49 FR 18887, 18890 (May 3, 1984). \n28.\u2002   For example, in EPA\u2019s 2009 GHG waiver that reconsidered \nthe 2008 GHG waiver denial, the Agency noted that \u201cGiven the \n\n76a\ndoes not mean that EPA has adopted an \u201calternative \napproach\u201d and required a demonstration for the need for \nspecific standards; rather, this additional Agency review \nhas been afforded to address commenters\u2019 concerns and \nthis secondary analysis has been done to support the \nAgency\u2019s primary assessment. For example, EPA granted \nan authorization for CARB\u2019s In-use Off-road Diesel \nStandards (Fleet Requirements) that included an analysis \nunder both approaches.29 The only two departures from \nthis traditional approach occurred first in 2008 when EPA \ncomments submitted, however, EPA has also considered an \nalternative interpretation, which would evaluate whether the \nprogram or standards has a rational relationship to contributing \nto amelioration of the air pollution problems in California. Even \nunder this approach, EPA\u2019s inquiry would end there. California\u2019s \npolicy judgment that an incremental, directional improvement will \noccur and is worth pursuing is entitled, in EPA\u2019s judgment, to great \ndeference. EPA\u2019s consistent view is that it should give deference to \nCalifornia\u2019s policy judgments, as it has in past waiver decisions, \non California\u2019s choice of mechanism used to address air pollution \nproblems. EPA does not second-guess the wisdom or efficacy of \nCalifornia\u2019s standards. EPA has also considered this approach \nwith respect to the specific GHG standards themselves, as well as \nCalifornia\u2019s motor vehicle emissions program.\u201d 74 FR at 32766 (citing \nto Motor & Equip.

On \nMarch 6, 2008, EPA denied the waiver request based \non a new interpretive finding that section 209(b) was \nintended for California to enforce new motor vehicle \nemission standards that address local or regional air \npollution problems, and an Agency belief that California \ncould not demonstrate a \u201cneed\u201d under section 209(b)\n(1)(B) for standards intended to address global climate \nchange problems. EPA also employed this new alternative \ninterpretation to state a belief that the effects of climate \nchange in California are not compelling and extraordinary \nin comparison with the rest of the country. Therefore, in \nthe 2008 waiver denial, EPA did not evaluate whether \nCalifornia had a need for its motor vehicle emission \nprogram to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions \n(the traditional interpretation) but rather focused on \nthe specific GHG emission standard in isolation and not \nin conjunction with the other motor vehicle emission \nstandards for criteria pollutants.\nIn 2009, EPA initiated a reconsideration of the \n2008 waiver denial. The reconsideration resulted in \ngranting CARB a waiver for its GHG emission standards \n\n78a\ncommencing in the 2009 model year.30 In granting \nthe waiver, EPA rejected the Agency\u2019s alternative \ninterpretation of the second waiver prong announced \nin the 2008 waiver denial. Instead, EPA returned to \nits traditional approach of evaluating California\u2019s need \nfor a separate motor vehicle emission program to meet \ncompelling and extraordinary conditions because the \nAgency viewed it as the better interpretation of the \nsecond waiver prong. Under the traditional interpretation, \nEPA found that the opponents of the waiver had not met \ntheir burden of proof to demonstrate that California did \nnot need its motor vehicle emission program to meet \ncompelling and extraordinary conditions. In responding \nto comments on this issue, EPA also determined that, \neven if the alternative interpretation were to be applied, \nthe opponents of the waiver had not demonstrated that \nCalifornia did not need its GHG emissions standards to \nmeet compelling and extraordinary conditions.31 \nSince EPA\u2019s 2009 GHG waiver decision and before \nSAFE 1 the Agency applied the traditional interpretation \nof the second waiver prong in its GHG-related waiver \n30.\u2002  74 FR 32743, 32745 (July 8, 2009). \n31.\u2002  74 FR at 32759-67. For example, EPA noted that the \nanalysis of the need for CARB\u2019s GHG standards in the 2008 waiver \ndenial failed to consider that although the factors that cause ozone \nare primarily local in nature and that ozone is a local or regional \nair pollution problem, the impacts of global climate change can \nnevertheless exacerbate this local air pollution problem. EPA noted \nthat California had made a case that its greenhouse gas standards \nare linked to amelioration of its smog problems.

In the first instance, \nin 2009, CARB adopted amendments to its certification \nrequirements that would accept demonstration to the \nFederal GHG standards as compliance with CARB\u2019s \nGHG program. This provision is known as a \u201cdeemed-to-\ncomply\u201d provision.32 In 2011, EPA determined that this \ndeemed-to-comply provision was within-the-scope of the \nwaiver issued in July 2009, relying on the traditional \ninterpretation of the second waiver prong.33 As such, \n32.\u2002  California Code of Regulations, Title 13 1961(a)(1)(B). \nUnder this provision, automakers could comply with the California \nGHG standards for model years 2017-2025 by meeting Federal GHG \nstandards for the same model years. \n33.\u2002  76 FR 34693.

EPA received comment \nduring the reconsideration of SAFE 1 that questioned whether \nCARB needed its GHG standards if it was otherwise accepting \ncompliance with the Federal GHG standards. EPA addressed the \nissue in its final decision (76 FR at 34696-98) and continues to believe \nEPA\u2019s analysis applies. The existence of federal emission standards \nthat CARB may choose to harmonize with or deem as compliance \nwith its own State standards (or that CARB may choose to set \nmore stringent standards) does not on its own render California\u2019s \nas not needed. CARB continues to administer an integrated and \ncomprehensive motor vehicle emission program (including its ZEV \nsales mandate and GHG emission standards and other applicable \nemission standards for light-duty vehicles) and this program \ncontinues to evolve to address California\u2019s serious air quality issues. \nCARB\u2019s decision to select some federal emission standards as \n\n80a\nin the June 14, 2011 within-the-scope decision EPA \ndetermined that CARB\u2019s 2009 amendments did not affect \nor undermine the Agency\u2019s prior determination made in \nthe 2009 GHG waiver decision, including the technological \nfeasibility findings in section 209(b)(1)(C).34 EPA also \nacted on two requests for waivers of preemption for \nCARB\u2019s heavy-duty (HD) tractor-trailer GHG emission \nstandards.35 Once again, EPA relied upon its traditional \napproach of evaluating California\u2019s need for a separate \nmotor vehicle emission program to meet compelling and \nextraordinary conditions and found that no evidence \nhad been submitted to demonstrate that California no \nsufficient to comply with its own State emission standards does not \nnegate the overall design and purpose of section 209 of the CAA. \nIn the within-the-scope decision issued in 2011, EPA agreed with \nGlobal Automakers comment that the deemed-to-comply provision \nrenders emission benefits equally protective as between California \nand Federal programs.

Rather, EPA noted, \nthe relevant question is whether California needs its own motor \nvehicle emission program and not whether there is a need for specific \nstandards.

EPA posited that since the grant of the initial \nwaiver a reassessment of California\u2019s need for its GHG \nstandards and ZEV sales mandate under the second \nwaiver prong, section 209(b)(1)(B), was appropriate. EPA \nfurther posited that its own Federal GHG rulemaking in \nthe SAFE proposal raised questions about the feasibility \nof CARB\u2019s standards under the third waiver prong, section \n209(b)(1)(C).39 In addition, EPA reasoned that the SAFE \nproposal presented a unique situation that required \nEPA to consider the implications of NHTSA\u2019s proposed \nconclusion that California\u2019s GHG emission standards and \nZEV sales mandate were preempted by EPCA.40 EPA \n38.\u2002  The Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles Rule \nfor Model Years 2021-2026 Passenger Cars and Light Trucks, 83 \nFR at 42986. \n39.\u2002  As explained below, EPA did not make a determination \nregarding section 209(b)(1)(C) in SAFE 1. \n40.\u2002  \u201cTo the extent that NHTSA has determined that these \nstandards are void ab initio because EPCA preempts standards that \nrelate to fuel economy, that determination presents an independent \nbasis for EPA to consider the validity of the initial grant of a waiver \n\n83a\nthus also posited that state standards preempted under \nEPCA cannot be afforded a valid section 209(b) waiver \nand then proposed that it would be necessary to withdraw \nthe waiver separate and apart from section 209(b)(1)(B) \nand (C) if NHTSA finalized its interpretation regarding \npreemption under EPCA. \nDuring the SAFE 1 proceeding, EPA received \nadditional information demonstrating that the ZEV \nsales mandate plays a role in reducing criteria pollution, \nincluding CARB\u2019s comments that EPA\u2019s prior findings \nin the ACC program waiver were correct.

In the same action, EPA withdrew the \nwaiver of preemption for California to enforce the ACC \nprogram GHG and ZEV sales mandate on two grounds.45 \nFirst, in SAFE 1 the Agency posited that standards \npreempted under EPCA could not be afforded a valid \nwaiver of preemption under section 209(b).

Additionally, EPA expressed its intention \nnot to consider factors other than statutory criteria set out \nin section 209(b)(1)(A)-(C) in future waiver proceedings, \nexplaining that addressing the preemptive effect of EPCA \nand its implications for EPA\u2019s waiver for California\u2019s GHG \nstandards and ZEV sales mandate was uniquely called for \nin SAFE 1 because EPA and NHTSA were coordinating \nregulatory actions in a single notice.47 \nSecond, EPA withdrew the waiver for the GHG \nstandards and ZEV sales mandate under the second waiver \nprong, section 209(b)(1)(B), on two alternative grounds. \nSpecifically, EPA determined first that California does \nnot need the GHG standards \u201cto meet compelling and \nextraordinary conditions,\u201d under section 209(b)(1)(B), \nand second, even if California does have compelling and \nextraordinary conditions in the context of global climate \nchange, California does not \u201cneed\u201d the specific GHG \nstandards under section 209(b)(1)(B) because they will not \nmeaningfully address global air pollution problems of the \ntype associated with GHG emissions.48 EPA also reasoned \n46.\u2002  84 FR at 51338. \n47.\u2002  Id. \n48.\u2002  Id. at 51341-42. \n\n87a\nthat because CARB had characterized the ZEV sales \nmandate as a compliance mechanism for GHG standards, \nboth were \u201cclosely interrelated\u201d given the overlapping \ncompliance regimes for the ACC program, and as a result \nthe ZEV sales mandate was inextricably interconnected \nwith CARB\u2019s GHG standards.49 In support of its overall \ndetermination that the ZEV sales mandate was not needed \nto meet compelling and extraordinary conditions, EPA \nrelied on a single statement in the ACC program waiver \nsupport document where CARB did not attribute criteria \nemission reductions to the ZEV sales mandate, but rather \nnoted its LEV III criteria pollutant fleet standard was \nresponsible for those emission reductions.50 Relying on \nthis reasoning, EPA also withdrew the waiver for the ZEV \nsales mandate under the second waiver prong finding that \nCalifornia had no \u201cneed\u201d for its own ZEV sales mandate. \nIn withdrawing the waiver, EPA relied on an \nalternative view of the scope of the Agency\u2019s analysis of \nCalifornia waiver requests and posited that reading \u201csuch \nState standards\u201d as requiring EPA to only and always \nconsider California\u2019s entire motor vehicle program would \nlimit the application of this waiver prong in a way that \nEPA did not believe Congress intended.51 EPA further \n49.\u2002  Id. at 51337. \n50.\u2002  Id. at 51330. \n51.\u2002  In other words, EPA asserted that once it determines that \nCalifornia needed its very first set of submitted standards to meet \nextraordinary and compelling conditions, EPA would never have the \ndiscretion to determine that California did not need any subsequent \nstandards for which it sought a successive waiver. EPA based its \n\n88a\nnoted that the Supreme Court had found that CAA \nprovisions may apply differently to GHGs than they do to \ntraditional pollutants in UARG v. EPA, 134 S.

EPA then interpreted section 209(b)(1)(B) \nas requiring a particularized, local nexus between (1) \npollutant emissions from sources, (2) air pollution, and \n(3) resulting impact on health and welfare.52 Interpreting \nsection 209(b)(1)(C) to be limited to the specific standards \nunder the waiver, EPA stated that \u201csuch State standards\u201d \nin sections 209(b)(1)(B) and (C) should be read consistently \nwith each other, which EPA asserted was a departure \nfrom the traditional approach where this phrase in section \n209(b)(1)(B) is read as referring back to \u201cin the aggregate\u201d \nin section 209(b)(1).53 \nreading also on an assertion of ambiguity in the meaning of \u201csuch \nState standards\u201d in section 209(b)(1)(B). \n52.\u2002  Id. at 51339-40. \n53.\u2002  Id. at 51344-45.EPA notes that this SAFE 1 position was \ntaken despite the Agency previously stating in the ACC program \nwaiver that \u201cSimilarly, although the Dealers might suggest that \nEPA only be obligated to determine whether each of CARB\u2019s ACC \nregulatory components, in isolation, is consistent with section 202(a) \nwe believe the better approach is to determine the technological \nfeasibility of each standard in the context of the entire regulatory \nprogram for the particular industry category. In this case, we \nbelieve CARB has in fact recognized the interrelated, integrated \napproach the industry must take in order to address the regulatory \n\n89a\nIn the SAFE proposal, as an additional basis for \nthe waiver withdrawal, EPA proposed to find that \nCARB\u2019s ZEV sales mandate and GHG standards are not \nconsistent with section 202(a) of the CAA under the third \nwaiver prong, section 209(b)(1)(C).54 However, in the final \nSAFE 1 action, EPA and NHTSA explained they were \nnot finalizing the proposed assessment regarding the \ntechnological feasibility of the Federal GHG and CAFE \nstandards for MY 2021 through 2025 in SAFE 1, and thus \nEPA did not finalize any determination with respect to \nsection 209(b)(1)(C).55 \nIn justifying the withdrawal action in SAFE 1, \nEPA opined that the text, structure, and context of \nsection 209(b) supported EPA\u2019s authority to reconsider \nprior waiver grants. Specifically, EPA asserted that \nthe Agency\u2019s authority to reconsider the grant of ACC \ncomponents of the ACC program. As noted above, the House \nCommittee Report explained as part of the 1977 amendments to the \nClean Air Act that California was to be afforded flexibility to adopt \na complete program of motor vehicle emission controls (emphasis \nadded). As such, EPA believes that Congress intended EPA to afford \nCalifornia the broadest possible discretion in selecting the best \nmeans to protect the health of its citizens and the public welfare.32 \nEPA believes this intent extends to CARB\u2019s flexibility in designing \nits motor vehicle emission program and evaluating the aggregate \neffect of regulations within the program.\u201d 78 FR at 2217. \n54.\u2002  83 FR at 43240. \n55.\u2002  84 FR at 51350. EPA explained that it may make a \ndetermination in connection with a future final action with regard \nto Federal standards. EPA\u2019s subsequent regulation to issue Federal \nstandards did not address this issue. 85 FR 24174. \n\n90a\nprogram waiver was implicit in section 209(b) given that \nrevocation of a waiver is implied in the authority to grant \na waiver. The Agency noted that further support for the \nauthority to reconsider could be found in a single sentence \nin the 1967 legislative history of provisions now codified \nin sections 209(a) and (b) and the judicial principle that \nagencies possess inherent authority to reconsider their \ndecisions. According to the Senate report from the 1967 \nCAA amendments, the Administrator has \u201cthe right . . . \nto withdraw the waiver at any time [if] after notice and \nan opportunity for public hearing he finds that the State \nof California no longer complies with the conditions of \nthe waiver.\u201d56 EPA also noted that, subject to certain \nlimitations, administrative agencies possess inherent \nauthority to reconsider their decisions in response to \nchanged circumstances: \u201cIt is well settled that EPA has \ninherent authority to reconsider, revise, or repeal past \ndecisions to the extent permitted by law so long as the \nAgency provides a reasoned explanation.\u201d57 This authority \nexists in part because EPA\u2019s interpretations of the statutes \nit administers \u201care not carved in stone.\u201d58 \nFinally, in SAFE 1, EPA provided an interpretive \nview of section 177 as not authorizing other states to adopt \nCalifornia\u2019s GHG standards for which EPA had granted \na waiver of preemption under section 209(b). Although \nsection 177 does not require states that adopt California\u2019s \n56.\u2002  84 FR at 51332 (citing S. Rep.

EPA stated that nonattainment designations \nexist only as to criteria pollutants and GHGs are not \ncriteria pollutants; therefore, states could not adopt \nGHG standards under section 177. Notably, California in \nprevious waiver requests addressed the criteria pollutant \nbenefits of GHG emissions reductions, specifically related \nto ground level ozone.\nD.\t Petitions for Reconsideration\nAfter issuing SAFE 1, EPA received three petitions \nfor reconsideration urging the Agency to reconsider the \nwaiver withdrawal of the ACC program\u2019s GHG standards \nand ZEV sales mandate and to rescind part or all of the \nSAFE 1 action.59 The first Petition for Clarification/\nReconsideration was submitted by the State of California \nand a number of States and Cities on October 9, 2019 \n(California Petition for Clarification).60 These Petitioners \nsought both clarification and reconsideration of the scope \nof SAFE 1. Citing somewhat contradictory statements in \nthe action, they claimed that SAFE 1 created confusion \nregarding which model years of the ACC program were \n59.\u2002  The California Petition for Clarification only sought \nreconsideration of SAFE 1 to the extent it withdrew the ACC \nprogram waiver for model years outside those proposed. The other \ntwo petitions sought reconsideration of the full SAFE 1 action. \n60.\u2002  EPA-OAR-2021-0257-0015. \n\n92a\naffected by the waiver withdrawal.61 They based their \nrequest for reconsideration of the withdrawal on the \ngrounds that the SAFE 1 action relied on analyses and \njustifications not presented at proposal and, thus, was \nbeyond the scope of the proposal. \nA second Petition for Reconsideration was submitted \nby several non-governmental organizations on November \n25, 2019 (NGOs\u2019 Petition).62 These Petitioners claimed that \nEPA\u2019s reconsideration of the ACC program waiver was not \na proper exercise of agency authority because the Agency \nfailed to consider comments submitted after the formal \ncomment period\u2014which they charged as inadequate\u2014\nand because the EPA\u2019s rationale was a pretextual cover \n61.\u2002  The California Petition for Clarification notes that, \u201c[i]n the \nFinal Actions, EPA makes statements that are creating confusion, \nand, indeed, appear contradictory, concerning the temporal scope \nof its action(s)\u2014specifically, which model years are covered by the \npurported withdrawal of California\u2019s waiver for its GHG and ZEV \nstandards. In some places, EPA\u2019s statements indicate that it has \nlimited its action(s) to the model years for which it proposed to \nwithdraw and for which it now claims to have authority to withdraw\u2014\nnamely model years 2021 through 2025. In other places, however, \nEPA\u2019s statements suggest action(s) with a broader scope\u2014one \nthat would include earlier model years.\u201d Id. at 2. In SAFE 1, EPA \nwithdrew the waiver for California\u2019s GHG and ZEV standards for \nmodel years 2017-2025 on the basis of EPCA preemption and for \nmodel years 2021-2025 on the basis of the second waiver prong. \n62.\u2002  EPA-HQ-OAR-2021-0257-0014. This Petition was \njoined by The Center for Biological Diversity, Chesapeake Bay \nFoundation, Environment America, Environmental Defense Fund, \nEnvironmental Law & Policy Center, Natural Resources Defense \nCouncil, Public Citizen, Inc., Sierra Club, and the Union of Concerned \nScientists. \n\n93a\nfor the Administration\u2019s political animosity towards \nCalifornia and the oil industry\u2019s influence. The late \ncomments summarized in the Petition address SAFE 1\u2019s \nEPCA preemption and second waiver prong arguments. \nOn EPCA preemption, the summarized comments \nasserted that EPCA does not preempt GHG standards \nbecause GHG emission standards are not the \u201cfunctional \nequivalent\u201d of fuel economy standards, as SAFE 1 \nclaimed. On the second waiver prong, the summarized \ncomments asserted both that GHG and ZEV standards \ndo have criteria pollutant benefits, and that the threat of \nclimate change is compelling and extraordinary and will \nhave California-specific impacts. In addition to objections \nto SAFE 1\u2019s EPCA preemption and second waiver prong \narguments, the summarized comments asserted that ZEV \nstandards play a key role in SIPs, which were disrupted \nby SAFE 1. This disruption, Petitioners claimed, violated \n\u201cconformity\u201d rules prohibiting federal actions from \nundermining state\u2019s air quality plans.63 \nA third Petition for Reconsideration was submitted by \nseveral states and cities on November 26, 2019 (States and \nCities\u2019 Petition).64 These Petitioners sought reconsideration \n63.\u2002  These \u201clate comments\u201d can be found in the \u201cAppendix \nof Exhibits\u201d attached to the Petition for Reconsideration. These \ncomments are considered part of EPA\u2019s record for purposes of the \nreconsideration of SAFE 1. \n64.\u2002  See EPA-HQ-OAR-2021-0257-0029. This Petition was \njoined by the States of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, \nHawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, \nNew Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, \nVermont, Washington, Wisconsin, Michigan, the Commonwealths of \nMassachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, the District of Columbia, \n\n94a\nof the withdrawal on the grounds that EPA failed to \nprovide an opportunity to comment on various rationales \nand determinations, in particular on its authority to \nrevoke argument, flawed re-interpretation and application \nof the second waiver prong, its flawed new rationale for \nconsidering factors outside section 209(b) (namely, EPCA \npreemption), and its determination that states cannot \nadopt California\u2019s GHG standards under section 177. For \nexample, these Petitioners claimed they did not have an \nadequate opportunity to comment on EPA\u2019s use of equal \nsovereignty or the endangerment finding as rationales for \nits new \u201cparticularized nexus\u201d interpretation of the second \nwaiver prong. These Petitioners also claimed that EPA\u2019s \nstatements concerning the burden of proof applicable to \na waiver revocation were either unclear or inaccurate, \nparticularly whether the Agency bears the burden of proof \nin withdrawing a previously granted waiver and, if not, \nhow and why this burden of proof is different from the \nburden of proof for denying a waiver request.65 Finally, \nthese Petitioners asserted that the Agency failed to \nconsider comments, submitted after the formal comment \nperiod, that challenged EPA\u2019s interpretation of the second \nwaiver prong, including new evidence of California\u2019s need \nfor its GHG emission standards and ZEV sales mandate, \nand alleged that EPA\u2019s rationale was pretextual and \nbased on the Administration\u2019s political animosity towards \nCalifornia and on the oil industry\u2019s influence. \nand the Cities of Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, and San \nJose. \n65.\u2002  The applicable burden of proof for a waiver withdrawal is \ndiscussed in Section III of this decision. \n\n95a\nEPA notified the petitioners in the above-noted \nPetitions for Reconsideration that the Agency would \nbe considering issues raised in their petitions as part \nof the proceeding to reconsider SAFE 1. This action \naddresses these petitions in the broader context of EPA\u2019s \nadjudicatory reconsideration of SAFE 1 commenced in \nresponse to a number of significant issues with SAFE 1.\nIII.\tPrinciples Governing This Review\nThe CAA has been a paradigmatic example of \ncooperative federalism, under which \u201cStates and the \nFederal Government [are] partners in the struggle against \nair pollution.\u201d66 In Title II, Congress authorized EPA to \npromulgate emission standards for mobile sources and \ngenerally preempted states from adopting their own \nstandards.67 At the same time, Congress created an \nimportant exception for the State of California. \n66.\u2002  General Motors Corp. v. United States, 496 U.S. 530, 532 \n(1990). \n67.\u2002  \u201cThe regulatory difference [between Titles I and II] is \nexplained in part by the difficulty of subjecting motor vehicles, \nwhich readily move across state boundaries, to control by individual \nstates.\u201d Engine Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 88 F.3d 1075, 1079 (D.C. Cir. \n1996). Congress also asserted federal control in this area to avoid \n\u201cthe specter of an anarchic patchwork of federal and state regulatory \nprograms\u201d nationwide. See Motor & Equip. Mfrs. Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. EPA, \n627 F.2d 1095, 1109 (D.C. Cir. 1979) ( MEMA I ). \n\n96a\nA.\t Scope of Preemption and Waiver Criteria Under \nthe Clean Air Act\nThe legal framework for this decision stems from the \nwaiver provision first adopted by Congress in 1967, and \nsubsequent amendments. In Title II of the CAA, Congress \nestablished only two programs for control of emissions \nfrom new motor vehicles\u2014EPA emission standards \nadopted under the CAA and California emission standards \nadopted under its state law. Congress accomplished this \nby preempting all state and local governments from \nadopting or enforcing emission standards for new motor \nvehicles, while at the same time providing that California \ncould receive a waiver of preemption for its emission \nstandards and enforcement procedures in keeping with \nits prior experience regulating motor vehicles and its \nserious air quality problems. Accordingly, section 209(a) \npreempts states or political subdivisions from adopting \nor attempting to enforce any standard relating to the \ncontrol of emissions from new motor vehicles.68 Under the \nterms of section 209(b)(1), after notice and opportunity \nfor public hearing, EPA must waive the application of \nsection 209(a) to California unless the Administrator finds \n68.\u2002  42 U.S.C. 7543(a)-(a) Prohibition No State or any political \nsubdivision thereof shall adopt or attempt to enforce any standard \nrelating to the control of emissions from new motor vehicles or new \nmotor vehicle engines subject to this part. No State shall require \ncertification, inspection, or any other approval relating to the control \nof emissions from any new motor vehicle or new motor vehicle \nengine as condition precedent to the initial retail sale, titling (if \nany), or registration of such motor vehicle, motor vehicle engine, or \nequipment. \n\n97a\nat least one of three criteria to deny a waiver in section \n209(b)(1)(A)-(C) has been met.69 EPA may thus deny a \nwaiver only if it makes at least one of these three findings \nbased on evidence in the record, including arguments that \nopponents of the waiver have provided. This framework \nstruck an important balance that protected manufacturers \nfrom multiple and different state emission standards and \npreserved a pivotal role for California in the control of \nemissions from new motor vehicles. Congress intentionally \nstructured this waiver provision to restrict and limit \nEPA\u2019s ability to deny a waiver and did this to ensure that \nCalifornia had broad discretion in selecting the means \nit determined best to protect the health and welfare of \n69.\u2002  42 U.S.C. 7543(b)(1): \n(1) The Administrator shall, after notice and \nopportunity for public hearing, waive application of \nthis section to any State which has adopted standards \n(other than crankcase emission standards) for the \ncontrol of emissions from new motor vehicles or new \nmotor vehicle engines prior to March 30, 1966, if the \nState determines that the State standards will be, in \nthe aggregate, at least as protective of public health \nand welfare as applicable Federal standards. No such \nwaiver shall be granted if the Administrator finds \nthat\u2014\n(A) the determination of the State is arbitrary and \ncapricious,\n(B) such State does not need such State standards \nto meet compelling and extraordinary conditions, or\n(C) such State standards and accompanying \nenforcement procedures are not consistent with \nsection 7521(a) of this title.\n\n98a\nits citizens in recognition of both the harsh reality of \nCalifornia\u2019s air pollution and to allow California to serve \nas a pioneer and a laboratory for the nation in setting \nnew motor vehicle emission standards and developing \ncontrol technology.70 Accordingly, section 209(b) specifies \nthat EPA must grant California a waiver if California \ndetermines that its standards are, in the aggregate, at \nleast as protective of the public health and welfare as \napplicable Federal standards. \nEPA has consistently interpreted the waiver provision \nas placing the burden on the opponents of a waiver and \nEPA to demonstrate that one of the criteria for a denial \nhas been met. In this context, since 1970, EPA has \nrecognized its limited discretion in reviewing California \nwaiver requests. For over fifty years, therefore, EPA\u2019s role \nupon receiving a request for waiver of preemption from \nCalifornia has been limited and remains only to determine \nwhether it is appropriate to make any of the three findings \nspecified by the CAA. If the Agency cannot make at \nleast one of the three findings, then the waiver must be \ngranted. The three waiver criteria are also properly \nseen as criteria for a denial. This reversal of the normal \nstatutory structure embodies and is consistent with the \ncongressional intent of providing deference to California \nto maintain its own new motor vehicle emission program.\n70.\u2002  See, e.g., S. Rep. No. 403, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. 33 (1967) \n(The waiver of preemption is for California\u2019s \u201cunique problems and \npioneering efforts.\u201d); 113 Cong. Rec. 30950, 32478 (\u201c[T]he State will \nact as a testing agent for various types of controls and the country \nas a whole will be the beneficiary of this research.\u201d) (Statement of \nSen. Murphy); MEMA I, 627 F.2d 1095, 1111 (D.C. Cir. 1979). \n\n99a\nThe 1970 CAA Amendments strengthened EPA\u2019s \nauthority to regulate vehicular \u201cemission[s] of any air \npollutant,\u201d while reaffirming the corresponding breadth \nof California\u2019s entitlement to regulate those emissions \n(amending CAA section 202 and recodifying the waiver \nprovision as section 209(b), respectively). Congress also \nestablished the NAAQS program, under which EPA \nissues air quality criteria and sets standards for so-called \n\u201ccriteria\u201d pollutants, and states with regions that have \nnot \u201cattained\u201d those federal standards must submit SIPs \nindicating how they plan to attain the NAAQS (which \nis often a multi-year, comprehensive plan). With the \nCAA Amendments of 1977, Congress allowed California \nto consider the protectiveness of its standards \u201cin the \naggregate,\u201d rather than requiring that each standard \nproposed by the State be as or more stringent than its \nfederal counterpart.71 Congress also approved EPA\u2019s \ninterpretation of the waiver provision as providing \nappropriate deference to California\u2019s policy goals and \nconsistent with Congress\u2019s intent \u201cto permit California to \nproceed with its own regulatory program\u201d for new motor \nvehicle emissions.72 \nIn previous waiver decisions, EPA has noted that \nthe statute specifies particular and limited grounds for \nrejecting a waiver and has therefore limited its review \nto those grounds. EPA has also noted that the structure \nCongress established for reviewing California\u2019s decision-\nmaking is deliberately narrow, which further supports \nthis approach. This has led EPA to reject arguments that \n71.\u2002  42 U.S.C. 7543(b)(1). \n72.\u2002  H.R. Rep.

The issue of whether a proposed \nCalifornia requirement is likely to result in \nonly marginal improvement in air quality not \ncommensurate with its cost or is otherwise \nan arguably unwise exercise of regulatory \npower is not legally pertinent to my decision \nunder section 209, so long as the California \nrequirement is consistent with section 202(a) \nand is more stringent than applicable Federal \nrequirements in the sense that it may result \nin some further reduction in air pollution \nin California. Thus, my consideration of all \nthe evidence submitted concerning a waiver \ndecision is circumscribed by its relevance to \nthose questions that I may consider under \nsection 209(b).73 \nGiven the text, legislative history, and judicial \nprecedent, EPA has consistently interpreted section \n209(b) as requiring it to grant a waiver unless opponents \nof a waiver can demonstrate that one of the criteria for a \ndenial has been met.74 \n73.\u2002  78 FR at 2115 (footnote omitted). \n74.\u2002  MEMA I, 627 F.2d at 1120-21 (\u201cThe language of the statute \nand its legislative history indicate that California\u2019s regulations, and \nCalifornia\u2019s determination that they comply with the statute, when \n\n101a\nThe 1977 CAA Amendments additionally demonstrated \nthe significance of California\u2019s standards to the Nation as \na whole with Congress\u2019 adoption of a new section 177. \nSection 177 permits other states addressing their own \nair pollution problems to adopt and enforce California \nnew motor vehicle standards \u201cfor which a waiver has been \ngranted if certain criteria are met.\u201d75 Also known as the \npresented to the Administrator are presumed to satisfy the waiver \nrequirements and that the burden of proving otherwise is on whoever \nattacks them.\u201d); Motor & Equip.

This opt-in \nauthority, set forth in \u00a7177 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7507, is carefully \ncircumscribed to avoid placing an undue burden on the automobile \nmanufacturing industry.\u201d). \n\n102a\n\u201copt-in\u201d provision, section 177 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7507, \nprovides: \nNotwithstanding section 7543(a) of this \ntitle, any State which has plan provisions \napproved under this part may adopt and enforce \nfor any model year standards relating to control \nof emissions from new motor vehicles or new \nmotor vehicle engines and take such other \nactions as are referred to in section 7543(a) of \nthis title respecting such vehicles if\u2014\n(1) such standards are identical to the \nCalifornia standards for which a waiver has \nbeen granted for such model year, and\n(2) California and such State adopt \nsuch standards at least two years before \ncommencement of such model year (as \ndetermined by regulations of the Administrator).\nNothing in this section or in Subchapter II \nof this chapter shall be construed as authorizing \nany such State to prohibit or limit, directly or \nindirectly, the manufacture or sale of a new \nmotor vehicle or motor vehicle engine that is \ncertified in California as meeting California \nstandards, or to take any action of any kind to \ncreate, or have the effect of creating, a motor \nvehicle or motor vehicle engine different that a \nmotor vehicle or engine certified in California \nunder California standards (a \u201cthird vehicle\u201d) \nor otherwise create such a \u201cthird vehicle.\u201d\n\n103a\nAny state with qualifying SIP provisions may exercise \nthis option and become a \u201cSection 177 State,\u201d without \nfirst seeking the approval from EPA.76 Thus, over time, \nCongress has recognized the important state role, for \nexample, by making it easier (by allowing California \nto consider its standards \u201cin the aggregate\u201d) and by \nexpanding the opportunity (via section 177) for states to \nadopt standards different from EPA\u2019s standards.77 \n76.\u2002  In 1990 Congress amended the CAA by adding section \n209(e) to section 209.

In waiver decisions, EPA has thus recognized \nthat congressional intent in creating a limited review of \nCalifornia waiver requests based on the section 209(b)(1) \ncriteria was to ensure that the federal government did \nnot second-guess the wisdom of state policy. In an early \nwaiver decision EPA highlighted this deference:\nIt is worth noting * * * I would feel \nconstrained to approve a California approach \nto the problem which I might also feel unable \nto adopt at the federal level in my own capacity \nas a regulator. The whole approach of the Clean \nAir Act is to force the development of new types \nof emission control technology where that is \nneeded by compelling the industry to \u201ccatch \nup\u201d to some degree with newly promulgated \nstandards. Such an approach * * * may be \nattended with costs, in the shape of reduced \nproduct offering, or price or fuel economy \npenalties, and by risks that a wider number of \nvehicle classes may not be able to complete their \ndevelopment work in time. Since a balancing \nof these risks and costs against the potential \nbenefits from reduced emissions is a central \npolicy decision for any regulatory agency under \n\n105a\nthe statutory scheme outlined above, I believe I \nam required to give very substantial deference \nto California\u2019s judgments on this score.78 \nAs noted above, Congress amended the CAA in 1977. \nWithin these amendments, Congress had the opportunity \nto reexamine the waiver provision and elected to expand \nCalifornia\u2019s flexibility to adopt a complete program of \nmotor vehicle emission controls. The House Committee \nReport explained that \u201c[t]he amendment is intended to \nratify and strengthen the California waiver provision \nand to affirm the underlying intent of that provision, \ni.e., to afford California the broadest possible discretion \nin selecting the best means to protect the health of its \ncitizens and the public welfare.\u201d79 \nSAFE 1 was a departure from congressional intent \nand EPA\u2019s typical practice of deference to California \non matters of state public policy regarding how best to \naddress its serious air quality problems.

We need not decide how this standard \noperates in every waiver decision.\u201d83 The court upheld \nthe Administrator\u2019s position that to deny a waiver, there \nmust be clear and compelling evidence to show that the \nproposed procedures undermine the protectiveness of \nCalifornia\u2019s standards. The court noted that this standard \nof proof also accords with the congressional intent to \nprovide California with the broadest possible discretion in \nsetting regulations it finds protective of the public health \nand welfare.84 With respect to the consistency finding, \n82.\u2002  MEMA I, 627 F.2d at 1122. \n83.\u2002  Id. \n84.\u2002  Id. \n\n108a\nthe court did not articulate a standard of proof applicable \nto all proceedings but found that the opponents of the \nwaiver were unable to meet their burden of proof even if \nthe standard were a mere preponderance of the evidence. \nAlthough MEMA I did not explicitly consider the \nstandards of proof under section 209 concerning a waiver \nrequest for \u201cstandards,\u201d as compared to accompanying \nenforcement procedures, there is nothing in the opinion \nto suggest that the court\u2019s analysis would not apply with \nequal force to such determinations. EPA\u2019s past waiver \ndecisions have consistently made clear that: \u201c[E]ven in \nthe two areas concededly reserved for Federal judgment \nby this legislation\u2014the existence of compelling and \nextraordinary conditions and whether the standards \nare technologically feasible\u2014Congress intended that \nthe standard of EPA review of the State decision to be a \nnarrow one.\u201d85 Although EPA evaluates whether there are \ncompelling and extraordinary conditions in California, \nthe Agency nevertheless accords deference to California \non its choices for how best to address such conditions in \nlight of the legislative history of section 209(b). \n85.\u2002  See, e.g., 40 FR at 23102-03.

News 1977, p. 1380). \n\n109a\nAs noted earlier, the burden of proof in a waiver \nproceeding is on EPA and the opponents of the waiver. \nThis is clear from the statutory language stating that \nEPA \u201cshall . . . waive\u201d preemption unless one of three \nstatutory factors is met. This reading was upheld by \nthe D.C. Circuit in MEMA I, which concluded that this \nobligation rests firmly with opponents of the waiver in \na section 209 proceeding, holding that: \u201c[t]he language \nof the statute and its legislative history indicate that \nCalifornia\u2019s regulations, and California\u2019s determinations \nthat they must comply with the statute, when presented \nto the Administrator are presumed to satisfy the waiver \nrequirements and that the burden of proving otherwise \nis on whoever attacks them. California must present its \nregulations and findings at the hearing and thereafter \nthe parties opposing the waiver request bear the burden \nof persuading the Administrator that the waiver request \nshould be denied.\u201d86 \nThe Administrator\u2019s burden, on the other hand, is to \nmake a reasonable evaluation of the information in the \nrecord in coming to the waiver decision. As the court in \nMEMA I stated, \u201cHere, too, if the Administrator ignores \nevidence demonstrating that the waiver should not be \ngranted, or if he seeks to overcome that evidence with \nunsupported assumptions of his own, he runs the risk \nof having his waiver decision set aside as \u2018arbitrary and \ncapricious.\u2019\u201d87 Therefore, the Administrator\u2019s burden is \nto act \u201creasonably.\u201d88 \n86.\u2002  MEMA I, 627 F.2d at 1121. \n87.\u2002  Id. at 1126. \n88.\u2002  Id. \n\n110a\nIn this instance, EPA has withdrawn a previously \ngranted waiver and is now reconsidering whether that \nwithdrawal was an appropriate exercise of authority, \nwhether the reinterpretation of the second waiver prong \nwas appropriate, and whether EPA\u2019s evaluation and \nfindings of fact under the second waiver prong meet the \napplicable burden of proof in the context of deference to \nCalifornia\u2019s policy choices. EPA believes that the same \nburden that is applicable to those opposed to an initial \nwaiver request from CARB (this applies to any party \nincluding the Administrator as explained in MEMA I ) is \nalso applicable to EPA\u2019s actions in SAFE 1 ( e.g., the burden \nof proof of whether California does not need its standards \nto meet compelling and extraordinary conditions rests on \nthose opposing a waiver for California).89 \n89.\u2002  In EPA\u2019s 2009 evaluation of the 2008 GHG waiver denial the \nAgency applied a similar test. See 74 FR at 32745 (\u201cAfter a thorough \nevaluation of the record, I am withdrawing EPA\u2019s March 6, 2008 \nDenial and have determined that the most appropriate action in \nresponse to California\u2019s greenhouse gas waiver request is to grant \nthat request. I have determined that the waiver opponents have not \nmet their burden of proof in order for me to deny the waiver under \nany of the three criteria in section 209(b)(1).\u201d). In the context of \n2009 GHG waiver that reconsidered the Agency\u2019s 2008 GHG waiver \ndenial, EPA determined it was appropriate to apply the same burden \nof proof during the reconsideration as would apply at the time of \nthe initial waiver evaluation. EPA received comment suggesting \nthat the entire burden of proof shifts to California in order for the \nprior 2008 denial to be reversed. EPA, in response, stated that \n\u201c. . . regardless of the previous waiver denial, once California makes \nits protectiveness determination the burden of proof falls on the \nopponents of the waiver . . . . This is consistent with the legislative \nhistory, which indicates that Congress intended a narrow review by \nEPA and to preserve the broadest possible discretion for California.\u201d \nId. at 32749. EPA acknowledges that in SAFE 1 the Agency not only \n\n111a\nIV.\tEPA Did Not Appropriately Exercise Its Limited \nAuthority To Reconsider the ACC Program Waiver \nin SAFE 1\nThe first question this final action tackles is whether \nthe agency properly exercised its reconsideration authority \nto withdraw its previously-granted waiver in SAFE 1. \nEPA concludes that it did not, and on that independent \nbasis rescinds SAFE 1\u2019s waiver withdrawal.\nSection 209 does not provide EPA with express \nauthority to reconsider and withdraw a waiver previously \ngranted to California. EPA\u2019s authority thus stems from its \ninherent reconsideration authority. For several reasons, \nin the context of reconsidering a waiver grant, that \nauthority may only be exercised sparingly. First, EPA \nbelieves its inherent authority to reconsider a waiver \nadopted an interpretation of the second waiver prong which was \nsimilar to the previously rejected interpretation, but that in doing \nso also questioned its previous position that the burden of proof in \nevaluating the need for standards at issue resides with those that \noppose the waiver, including EPA. See 84 FR at 51344 n.268. In \nthis action, however, EPA now finds that the historical deference \nprovided to California regarding its policy choices on how best to \naddress its serious air quality conditions also requires that the \nburden of proof should reside in those seeking to demonstrate that \nstandards are not needed under the second waiver prong regardless \nof whether the rationale is characterized as a new interpretation or \nnot. The language of section 209(b)(1) requires California to make \na protectiveness finding under the first waiver prong. Moreover, \nnothing in section 209(b) could be read as support for drawing a \ndistinction between the burden of proof when the Agency considers \nan initial waiver request and one where the Agency reconsiders \na waiver decision based on a new interpretation of the statutory \ncriteria. That burden properly resides with opponents of the waiver. \n\n112a\ndecision is constrained by the three waiver criteria that \nmust be considered before granting or denying a waiver \nrequest under section 209(b). A contrary approach, which \ntreats reconsiderations as more broadly appropriate, \nwould undermine Congress\u2019 intent that California be \nable to exercise its policy judgments and develop motor \nvehicle controls programs to address California\u2019s air \npollution problems, and make advances which could be \nbuilt on by EPA or adopted by other states. Second, EPA \nbelieves it may only reconsider a previously granted \nwaiver to address a clerical or factual error or mistake, \nor where information shows that factual circumstances or \nconditions related to the waiver criteria evaluated when \nthe waiver was granted have changed so significantly that \nthe propriety of the waiver grant is called into doubt. Even \nwhen EPA is acting within the appropriate bounds of its \nauthority to reconsider, during that reconsideration EPA \nshould exercise its limited authority within a reasonable \ntimeframe and be mindful of reliance interests.\nThe Agency\u2019s reconsideration in SAFE 1 was not an \nappropriate exercise of authority; there was no clerical \nerror or factual error in the ACC program waiver, and \nSAFE 1 did not point to any factual circumstances or \nconditions related to the three waiver prongs that had \nchanged so significantly that the propriety of the waiver \ngrant is called into doubt. Rather, the 2019 waiver \nwithdrawal was based on a change in EPA\u2019s statutory \ninterpretation, an incomplete and inaccurate assessment \nof the record, and another agency\u2019s action beyond the \nconfines of section 209(b). EPA erred in reconsidering \na previously granted waiver on these bases. Moreover, \nin considering the passage of time between the initial \n\n113a\nwaiver and the SAFE 1 action, and the development of \nreliance interests based on the waiver, EPA finds those \nfactors do not support the reconsideration of the ACC \nprogram waiver that occurred in SAFE 1. Accordingly, \nas explained in detail below, EPA is rescinding SAFE 1\u2019s \nwithdrawal of its 2013 ACC program waiver because it \nwas an inappropriate exercise of reconsideration authority.\nA.\t Comments Received\nEPA received several comments in the reconsideration \nproceeding on the Agency\u2019s authority to reconsider \nwaivers. Comments on explicit authority focused on \nwhether any language in section 209(b)(1), on its face, \npermits EPA to reconsider a previously granted waiver. \nSome of these commenters also distinguished between \nthe denial of the 2008 waiver and the reconsideration and \ngrant of the GHG waiver in 2009, and EPA\u2019s grant of the \nACC program waiver in 2013 and the reconsideration and \nwithdrawal of the ACC program waiver in 2019.\nEPA received comments in support of and against \nthe view that EPA has inherent authority to reconsider \nwaivers. As support for EPA\u2019s implied authority to \nreconsider, one commenter cited relevant language from \nthe Senate Committee Report from 1967 that stated, \n\u201cimplicit in [\u00a7209] is the right of [EPA] to withdraw the \nwaiver [if] at any time after notice and an opportunity \nfor public hearing he finds that the State of California \nno longer complies with the conditions of that waiver.\u201d90 \n90.\u2002  Urban Air Initiative (Urban Air), Docket No. EPA-HQ-\nOAR-2021-0257-0223 at 22 (quoting S.

Otherwise, EPA would be unable to monitor \nCARB\u2019s continued compliance with the waiver conditions \nin light of updated information.91 The same commenter \nalso argued that an agency generally retains the authority \nto reconsider and correct any earlier decision unless \nCongress acts to displace the authority with a process to \nrectify the Agency\u2019s mistakes and that explicit statutory \nauthority to withdraw a waiver is therefore not necessary, \nbecause \u201cthe power to reconsider is inherent in the power \nto decide.\u201d92 The commenter claimed that, under Chevron, \n\u201c[a]n agency has a \u2018continuing\u2019 statutory obligation to \nconsider the \u2018wisdom of its policy.\u2019\u201d93 \nIn contrast, several commenters maintained that \nsection 209(b) strongly indicates that EPA\u2019s authority to \n91.\u2002  Id. at 21 (\u201cA determination that California\u2019s state standards \nare technologically feasible and appropriate requires complex \ntechnical projections at the frontiers of science, which must be \ncontinually updated \u2018if the actual future course of technology \ndiverges from expectation.\u2019\u201d (quoting NRDC Inc. v.

The 1967 legislative \nhistory provides some indication of congressional intent \nto preserve some implied authority for EPA to reconsider \nprevious waiver decisions, but also to place limitations \non it. This legislative history explains: \u201c[i]mplicit in this \nprovision is the right of the [Administrator] to withdraw \nthe waiver at any time [if] after notice and an opportunity \nfor public hearing he finds that the State of California \nno longer complies with the conditions of the waiver.\u201d142 \nThus, from the earliest days of the program it has been \nunderstood that any withdrawal of a waiver should be \ntied to the statutory criteria and California\u2019s compliance \nwith them. This legislative history must be taken into \naccount along with Congress\u2019s intent expressed in the 1977 \nlegislative history, which, as discussed previously, sought \nto ensure deference to California and to strengthen that \nstate\u2019s role in driving emissions-reducing technological \ninnovation. Congress was also mindful to ensure the \nability of other states to adopt California\u2019s standards.143 \nUltimately, EPA concludes it has authority to reconsider \npreviously-granted waivers, but that this authority may \nonly be exercised sparingly. As discussed below, there are \nseveral considerations that support narrow authority to \nreconsider waiver grants. \nFirst and most important, EPA believes its inherent \nauthority to reconsider a waiver decision is constrained \nby the three waiver criteria that must be considered \nbefore granting or denying a waiver request under section \n142.\u2002  S. Rep. No. 90-403, at 34 (1967). \n143.\u2002  See supra Section III.B. \n\n134a\n209(b). It would be inappropriate and inconsistent with \ncongressional intent for EPA to reconsider and withdraw a \nwaiver on a ground outside the limited scope of those which \nCongress specified for EPA to consider when reviewing \na waiver in the first place.144 In the few instances where \nthe Agency reconsidered prior waiver decisions prior to \nSAFE 1, EPA focused its review on the section 209(b) \nstatutory waiver criteria.145 \nA circumscribed approach to reconsideration of \nwaivers is consistent with the deference to California\u2019s \npolicy judgment that Congress built into the waiver \nprocess.146 Congress explicitly required that EPA \u201cshall\u201d \ngrant the waiver unless one of three limited criteria \nare met. The use of the word \u201cshall\u201d (versus \u201cmay\u201d) \nwas heavily debated by the enacting Congress, with \nthe successful proponents of \u201cshall\u201d explaining that \nsuch language would \u201cguarantee\u201d that California could \nregulate with the burden placed on EPA to demonstrate \n144.\u2002  See MEMA I, 627 F.2d at 1115 (noting that section 209(b) \ncreates \u201ca narrowly circumscribed proceeding requiring no broad \npolicy judgments\u201d). \n145.\u2002  EPA initiated reconsideration of certain motor-cycle \nstandards, under the third waiver prong, section 209(b)(1)(C), in \norder to \u201cvacate that portion of the waiver previously granted under \nsection 209(b).\u201d 47 FR 7306, 7309 (February 18, 1982).

EPA explained that the balancing of \nrisks and costs against potential benefits from reduced \nemissions is a central policy decision for any regulatory \nagency and substantial deference should be provided to \nCalifornia\u2019s judgement on such matters.156 \nIn addition, limiting reconsideration of waivers \nundergirds Congress\u2019 intent that California would be a \nlaboratory for the country driving emissions-reducing \ntechnological innovation when it created the program in \nthe first place. As the D.C. Circuit explained in MEMA \nI: \u201cThe history of congressional consideration of the \nCalifornia waiver provision, from its original enactment up \nthrough 1977, indicates that Congress intended the State \nto continue and expand its pioneering efforts at adopting \nand enforcing motor vehicle emission standards different \nfrom and in large measure more advanced than the \ncorresponding federal program; in short, to act as a kind \nof laboratory for innovation.\u201d157 Indeed, broad authority \nto reconsider waiver grants could undermine the very \nstructure that Congress built in Title II. Specifically, while \nEPA does not consider section 177 when reviewing waiver \nrequests under section 209, Congress built a structure \nwherein EPA must grant California a waiver under section \n209 unless one of the three statutory criteria are met, and \nthen other states may adopt California\u2019s standards under \nsection 177 as part of their overall air quality programs. \n156.\u2002  40 FR at 23104. \n157.\u2002  MEMA I, 627 F.2d at 110-11. \n\n138a\nLimited inherent authority to reconsider previously-\ngranted waivers as described in this action is important \nto the success of Congress\u2019s structure. \nFinally, even the sentence in the legislative history \nthat suggests EPA has inherent reconsideration authority \nin the first place, and which SAFE 1 relied on for its \nassertion of inherent reconsideration authority, lends \nweight to the view that this authority is limited. According \nto the Senate report from the 1967 CAA amendments, \nthe Administrator has \u201cthe right . . . to withdraw the \nwaiver at any time [if] after notice and an opportunity \nfor public hearing he finds that the State of California no \nlonger complies with the conditions of the waiver.\u201d158 That \nspecific circumstance\u2014where California does not comply \nwith the conditions of a waiver\u2014should not be expanded \nto include a gaping hole for discretionary administrative \npolicy changes. \nGiven all of the above considerations, several principles \nemerge. EPA\u2019s authority to reconsider a grant of a waiver, \nwhich is an adjudicatory action by the Administrator, is \nnot open-ended. Any reconsideration is constrained to \nthe criteria that Congress set out in section 209(b). Even \nwithin those statutory criteria, considering all of the \nfactors that weigh in favor of a narrow interpretation of the \nAgency\u2019s authority and the importance of not disrupting \nCongress\u2019s scheme, EPA believes reconsideration is \nlimited to situations where the Agency has made a clerical \nor factual error or mistake, or where information shows \n158.\u2002  S. Rep. No. 90-403, at 34 (1967). \n\n139a\nthat factual circumstances or conditions related to the \nwaiver criteria evaluated when the waiver was granted \nhave changed so significantly that the propriety of the \nwaiver grant is called into doubt. \nEven if the bases for EPA\u2019s reconsideration did satisfy \none of the foregoing conditions such that reconsideration \nmay be appropriate, during that reconsideration EPA \nbelieves it should consider the passage of time and reliance \ninterests. In the context of CAA waiver grants in general, \nand the 2013 ACC program waiver grant in particular, \nCalifornia is relying on its standards to meet short- and \nlong-term emission reduction goals.159 In addition, by the \ntime the SAFE proposal was published, twelve states had \nalready adopted at least one or both of the GHG and ZEV \nstandards.160 Several of these states incorporated these \nadopted standards into their SIPs.161 Several automakers \n159.\u2002  States and Cities at 17-18. \n160.\u2002  Id. at 17. \n161.\u2002  Id. at 10; Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources \n(Wisconsin), Docket No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2021-0257-0095 at 1 (\u201cThese \nstandards provide important and necessary reductions in both GHG \nand criteria pollutant emissions needed to meet state and local air \nquality goals and address federal CAA requirements.\u201d); Connecticut \nat 2 (\u201cThese programs enable long-term planning and yield critical \nemission reductions that are critical to meeting Connecticut\u2019s climate \ngoals as well as our statutory obligations to reach attainment with \nthe ozone NAAQs.\u201d); Delaware 2 (\u201cDelaware adopted the California \nLEV regulation and incorporated the LEV and GHG standards into \nthe State Implementation Plan. . . . Delaware will not meet air quality \ngoals without more protective vehicle emission standards.\u201d); Maine \nat 1 (\u201c[T]he LEV program was initially created to help attain and \n\n140a\nand industry groups have also indicated reliance on these \nstandards.162 \nReconsideration thus must carefully consider the \nfactors noted and should not be undertaken where \nimmense degrees of uncertainty are introduced in settled \nexpectations of California, other states, and regulated \nindustry or to allow for the continual questioning of \nEPA\u2019s decisions, thus impairing needed finality. Such \nreconsideration could frustrate congressional intent in \ndesigning the waiver program and ultimately discourage \nreliance by the recipient of EPA\u2019s waiver decision (CARB), \nstates that may have adopted CARB\u2019s regulations under \nthe terms of section 177 (and are permitted to enforce \nthe regulations once EPA grants a waiver to California) \nas well as the regulated industry.\nWe now turn to whether the reconsideration in SAFE \n1 was a proper exercise of EPA\u2019s inherent reconsideration \nauthority. As an initial matter, SAFE 1 did not assert \nthat any clerical or factual error or mistake was made \nin the 2013 ACC program waiver. Nor did SAFE 1 point \nto any evidence showing that factual circumstances or \nconditions related to the waiver criteria evaluated when \nthe waiver was granted have changed so significantly that \nmaintain the health-based National Ambient Air Quality Standards \n(NAAQS) . . . The California ZEV and GHG programs enable long-\nterm planning for both the states and the regulated community and \nhave been drivers of technological change across the industry.\u201d). \n162.\u2002  E.g., Ford at 1; Tesla at n.5, 4; Rivian (as a member of \nNCAT) at 13-14. \n\n141a\nthe propriety of the waiver grant is called into doubt. For \nexample, SAFE 1 did not assert that California was not \ncomplying with the terms of the waiver. Instead, SAFE 1\u2019s \nreconsideration was premised on retroactive application \nof discretionary policy changes. Therefore, EPA believes \nit did not appropriately exercise its inherent authority in \nSAFE 1 to reconsider the prior ACC program waiver. \nUpon reconsideration, and as further shown in Sections \nV and VI, EPA now believes that SAFE 1 amounted to \nan improper exercise of the Agency\u2019s limited inherent \nauthority to reconsider.163 \nSAFE 1 gave two primary reasons for withdrawing \nthe 2013 ACC program waiver. Neither was an appropriate \n163.\u2002  EPA acknowledges that, in the SAFE 1 proceedings, it had \nnoted that at the time of proposal that CARB had given notice that \nit was considering amending its \u201cdeemed to comply\u201d provision and \nthat by the time of SAFE 1, California had entered into agreements \nwith several automobile manufacturers to accept less stringent \nstandards than the California program or the Federal standards \nas promulgated in 2012. As noted in SAFE 1, EPA believed that \nneither of these matters were necessary for EPA\u2019s action in SAFE \n1, but that they provided further support for the action. 84 FR at \n51334 n.230. By this action, EPA finds that neither of these matters \namounted to a change in circumstances or conditions associated \nwith the three waiver criteria and EPA\u2019s evaluation of the criteria in \nthe ACC program waiver. EPA did not predicate its ACC program \nwaiver on CARB\u2019s deemed-to-comply provision or any changes to \nthe deemed-to-comply provision. (EPA does not take a position as \nto whether that provision has changed in its purpose as a result of \nCARB\u2019s 2018 amendment). Further, to the extent CARB utilized a \ndeemed-to-comply provision or uses non-regulatory mechanisms \nto achieve its air quality objectives, this had no bearing on EPA\u2019s \nassessment of whether CARB has a need for its standards under the \nsecond waiver prong at the time of SAFE 1 or now. \n\n142a\nbasis for reconsideration. First, SAFE 1 premised the \nrevocation on its interpretation of the second waiver \nprong, section 209(b)(1)(B), that called for the Agency\u2019s \nscrutiny of specific standards under the waiver rather than \nCalifornia\u2019s program as a whole. As explained in detail in \nSection V of this final action, that statutory interpretation \nis flawed, and EPA does not believe a new statutory \ninterpretation should be the basis of reconsidering the \ngrant of a waiver.\nSAFE 1 premised the withdrawal of the ACC program \nwaiver under section 209(b)(1)(B) on the perceived lack of \nrecord support on the causal link between GHG emission \nstandards and air quality conditions in California.164 Yet, \nthe underlying record from the ACC program waiver, \nand the record of SAFE 1, have shown that CARB\u2019s \nZEV sales mandate and GHG emission standards are \ndesigned to address California\u2019s serious air quality \nproblems, including both its NAAQS pollutants and \na variety of climate impacts from GHG emissions. As \ndiscussed in greater detail in Section V, EPA has since \nat least 2009 recognized that greenhouse gas pollution \nexacerbates criteria pollution, and climate change \nimpacts on California\u2019s air quality conditions ( e.g., heat \n164.\u2002  \u201cCalifornia\u2019s approach in its ACC program waiver request \ndiffered from the state\u2019s approach in its waiver request for MY 2011 \nand subsequent heavy-duty tractor-trailer GHG standards, where \nCalifornia quantified NO X emissions reductions attributed to GHG \nstandards and explained that they would contribute to PM and ozone \nNAAQS attainment.\u201d 84 FR at 51337 n.252 (citing 79 FR at 46256, \n46257 n.15, 46261, 46262 n.75). \n\n143a\nexacerbation of ozone).165 The ACC program was especially \ndesigned to address both criteria and GHG pollution, \n165.\u2002  The first HD GHG emissions standard waiver related to \ncertain new 2011 and subsequent model year tractor-trailers. 79 FR \n46256 (August 7, 2014).

This, too, was an \ninappropriate ground for reconsideration. As earlier \nnoted, EPA believes its inherent authority to reconsider a \nwaiver decision is constrained by the three waiver criteria \nthat must be considered before granting or denying a \nwaiver request under section 209(b). Preemption under \nEPCA is not one of these criteria and was not considered \nin CARB\u2019s ACC program waiver request or in EPA\u2019s \ngranting of that waiver. In fact, in its waiver grant, the \nAgency expressly found that consideration of preemption \nunder EPCA would be inappropriate and unnecessary. \nIn SAFE 1, the Agency did not premise its consideration \nof preemption under EPCA on any of the three statutory \ncriteria. Therefore, EPA believes that SAFE 1 was not \na proper exercise of the authority to reconsider on this \nbasis, and any subsequent action in SAFE 1 to withdraw \nthe ACC program waiver was inappropriate.\nAlthough SAFE 1 was an inappropriate exercise of \ninherent authority given that the Agency did not correct \na factual error and there was no change in factual \n\n146a\ncircumstances so significant that the propriety of the \nwaiver would be called into doubt, it is nevertheless \nrelevant to note that SAFE 1 did not give appropriate \nconsideration to the passage of time and the reliance \ninterests that had developed between the granting and \nthe revocation of the ACC program waiver. Several \nautomakers and industry groups have also indicated \nreliance on these standards, as previously discussed.170 \nCalifornia and section 177 states were, by the time \nof the reconsideration, into the long-term plans they \nhad developed relying on the ACC program waiver \nstandards.171 California and other states rely on waivers \n170.\u2002  E.g., Ford at 1; Tesla at n.5, 4; Rivian (as a member of \nNCAT) at 13-14. EPA notes that it received limited comment on \nwhether reliance interests had formed since the issuance of SAFE \n1 but nothing to demonstrate error in the findings regarding section \n209(b)(1)(C) made within the ACC program waiver. See Toyota, \nDocket No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2021-0381 (\u201cReinstatement of California\u2019s \nwaiver for model years 2021 and 2022 poses significant lead time \nchallenges considering that 2021 model year is well underway, and \n2022 model year vehicles are generally already designed, sourced, \ncertified to various regulatory requirements, and ready to begin \nproduction.\u201d). Further, as discussed elsewhere, the short passage of \ntime since the promulgation of SAFE 1 and ongoing litigation over \nthat action has, as automakers have noted in that briefing, prevented \nautomakers from relying on the waiver revocation. See also Twelve \nPublic Interest Organizations at 11 (noting filings by automakers \nsuggesting lack of reliance on the waiver withdrawal). \n171.\u2002  E.g., States and Cities at 17 (the length between the \nwaiver grant and reconsideration was too long \u201cby any measure.\u201d); \nTwelve Public Interest Organizations at app. 36.

EPA also received comment \nthat disagreed with this accounting of time stating that timeliness \nfor reconsidering an adjudication is measured from the date of the \nagency\u2019s decision, not from the date of activity resulting from that \ndecision. E.g., Am. Methyl, 749 F.2d at 835 (tethering timeliness \nto period for appeal of agency decision).\u201d Twelve Public Interest \nOrganizations app. 1 at 38. EPA believes it is not necessary to resolve \nthe permissible amount of time, or the existence or lack of a bright \nline, that may pass before reconsideration of its prior adjudication \nis no longer appropriate. However, EPA did not \u201ccondition\u201d its \nACC program waiver on any subsequent actions, including the \nMTE, which explicitly applied to the federal standards. See 78 FR \nat 2137. EPA expects its waiver adjudications to be final and that \nappropriate reliance may flow to affected parties. Moreover, in this \ninstance EPA did not make any final determination regarding the \nthird waiver prong at section 209(b)(1)(C). EPA notes that it has \nadministered the California waiver program for a number of decades \nand acknowledges that emission standards continue to evolve at the \nCalifornia and the federal levels. This evolution in the standards has \nrested on regulatory certainty and the enforceability of CARB\u2019s \nemission standards once a waiver has been issued by EPA under \nsection 209(b) of the CAA. As for the inclusion of the deemed-to-\ncomply provision in the California standards, California provided \ndocumentation demonstrating that the deemed-to-comply provision \nwas reliant upon the federal standards having a certain level of \nstringency, a fact that EPA had recognized.

EPA, however, did not \u201ccondition\u201d its ACC \nprogram waiver on any subsequent actions, including the \nMTE.178 EPA expects its waiver adjudications to be final \nand that appropriate reliance may flow to affected parties. \nMoreover, in this instance EPA did not make any final \ndetermination regarding the third waiver prong at section \n209(b)(1)(C). EPA notes that it has administered the \nCalifornia waiver program for a number of decades and \nacknowledges that emission standards continue to evolve \nat the California and the federal levels. This evolution in \nthe standards has rested on regulatory certainty and the \nenforceability of CARB\u2019s emission standards once a waiver \nhas been issued by EPA under section 209(b) of the CAA. \nEPA\u2019s historic practice of properly affording broad \ndiscretion to California has meant that in almost fifty \nreduce other harmful air pollutants, especially in communities of \ncolor and lower-income communities, which are disproportionately \nimpacted by vehicle pollution.

And while SAFE 1 cited prior reconsideration actions \nas support for the Agency\u2019s authority to reconsider prior \nwaiver decisions, as previously noted, EPA has historically \nlimited reconsideration of prior waived standards to \nstatutory criteria and most important, none of these \nprior reconsideration actions resulted in a revocation.179 \nAs further shown in Sections V and VI, SAFE 1 was the \nresult of a \u201cprobing substantive review of the California \nstandards,\u201d with the Agency substituting its own \njudgment for California\u2019s contrary to both congressional \nexhortation of deference to California and the Agency\u2019s \nreview practice. \nThis present reconsideration is an appropriate \nexercise of the Agency\u2019s reconsideration authority. It is not \nat all clear that the reasons for limiting reconsideration of \nwaiver grants apply to the same degree to reconsideration \nof waiver denials and withdrawals. However, EPA need not \nresolve the question in this action, because this action falls \nwell within the bounds of even the limited authority this \naction concludes the Agency possesses for reconsideration \nof waiver grants. First, this action corrects factual errors \nmade in the SAFE 1 waiver withdrawal. Specifically, \neven under SAFE 1\u2019s flawed interpretation of section \n209(b)(1)(B), SAFE 1 ignored facts demonstrating that \nCalifornia does need the specific standards at issue to meet \n179.\u2002  See, e.g., 43 FR at 7310 (affirming the grant of the waiver \nin the absence of \u201cfindings necessary to revoke California\u2019s waiver of \nFederal preemption for its motorcycle fill-pipe and fuel tank opening \nregulations.\u201d). \n\n152a\ncompelling and extraordinary conditions. Second, in this \nreconsideration EPA properly constrains its analysis to \nwhether SAFE 1 made one of the three statutory findings \nnecessary to deny a waiver. Third, this reconsideration \nis timely with respect to the finalization of SAFE 1 and \nlimited, if any, reliance interests have developed as a result \nof SAFE 1 (which has been subject to judicial review since \nits promulgation).\nC.\t Conclusion\nIn SAFE 1, EPA inappropriately exercised its limited \ninherent authority to reconsider the ACC program \nwaiver for several reasons. EPA believes its exercise of \nreconsideration authority to reinterpret the language of \nsection 209(b)(1)(B) was not taken to correct any factual \nor clerical error or based upon factual circumstances or \nconditions related to the waiver criteria evaluated when \nthe waiver was granted that have changed so significantly \nthat the propriety of the waiver grant is called into doubt. \nRather, as discussed in detail in Section V, it was based \nupon a flawed statutory interpretation and a misapplication \nof the facts under that interpretation. Likewise, EPA\u2019s \ndecision to reconsider the ACC program waiver based on \nNHTSA\u2019s rulemaking within SAFE 1, which raised issues \nbeyond the statutory waiver criteria, was inappropriate. \nFor these reasons EPA now believes it is appropriate to \nrescind its actions within SAFE 1.\n\n153a\nV.\t The SAFE 1 Interpretation of Section 209(b)(1)(B) \nwas Inappropriate and, in any Event, California \nmet its Requirements\nEven if SAFE 1\u2019s reconsideration of the 2013 program \nwaiver grant was appropriate, EPA concludes for two \nindependent reasons that its waiver withdrawal in SAFE \n1 based upon its new statutory interpretation was flawed. \nFirst, EPA concludes that the SAFE 1 interpretation of \nthe second waiver prong was not an appropriate reading \nof that second waiver prong, section 209(b)(1)(B). It bears \nnoting that the traditional interpretation is, at least, the \nbetter interpretation. Informed by but separate from the \nfactual analysis discussed next, the Agency finds that the \nnew interpretation set out in SAFE 1 was inconsistent \nwith congressional intent and contrary to the purpose \nof section 209(b). Under the traditional interpretation \nof the second waiver prong, California\u2019s need for its \nown motor vehicle program, including its GHG emission \nstandards and ZEV sales mandate, to meet compelling and \nextraordinary conditions is clear and the waiver should \nnot have been withdrawn. \nSecond, even if the interpretation in SAFE 1 were \nappropriate, EPA concludes that SAFE 1 incorrectly \nfound that California did not have a need for its specific \nstandards. EPA has evaluated California\u2019s need for both \nrequirements by applying both the traditional and the \nSAFE 1 interpretations of section 209(b)(1)(B). In doing \nso, EPA reviewed the record from the ACC program \nwaiver proceedings, including CARB\u2019s ACC program \nwaiver request and supporting documents, as well as the \ncomments received as part of the SAFE 1 proceeding and \n\n154a\nthe comments received under the present reconsideration \nof SAFE 1.180 The record review focused on salient \npronouncements and findings in the ACC program waiver \ndecision, such as the relationship of both criteria and \nGHG pollutants and the impacts of climate change on \nCalifornia\u2019s serious air quality conditions. For example, \nthe effects of climate change and the heat exacerbation \nof tropospheric ozone is well established. California\u2019s \nACC program is established, in part, to address this. \nCalifornia\u2019s program, including its GHG emission \nstandards, is also designed to address upstream criteria \nemission pollutants. The review did so primarily because \nSAFE 1 premised the withdrawal of the GHG standards at \nissue on the lack of a causal link between GHG standards \nand air quality conditions in California. The review \nincluded EPA\u2019s prior findings regarding heat exacerbation \nof ozone, a serious air quality issue recognized by EPA \nas presenting compelling and extraordinary conditions \nunder the second waiver prong. \n180.\u2002  EPA notes that it reviewed the factual record within the \nACC program waiver proceeding and finds there was no factual error \nin its evaluation of whether CARB\u2019s standards satisfied the second \nwaiver prong. EPA also notes, merely as confirming the finding it \nmade at the time of the ACC program waiver but not for purposes of \nmaking a new factual finding from that made at the time of the ACC \nprogram waiver decision, that the record and information contained \nin the SAFE 1 proceeding as well as the record and information \ncontained in the Agency\u2019s reconsideration of SAFE 1 (including late \ncomments submitted during the SAFE 1 proceeding and, in some \ncases, resubmitted during the Agency\u2019s reconsideration of SAFE 1) \nat each point in time clearly demonstrates the need of California\u2019s \nstandards (whether evaluated as a program or as specific standards) \nto meet compelling and extraordinary conditions within California. \n\n155a\nOn completion of this review, EPA finds no basis for \ndiscounting the ample record support on California\u2019s \nneed for both the GHG standards and the ZEV sales \nmandate to address compelling and extraordinary \nconditions in California when using both the traditional \nand SAFE 1 interpretation to the second waiver prong. \nAdditionally, because of the way CARB\u2019s motor vehicle \nemission standards operate in tandem and are designed \nto reduce both criteria and GHG pollution and the ways \nin which GHG pollution exacerbates California\u2019s serious \nair quality problems, including the heat exacerbation of \nozone, the Agency in SAFE 1 should not have evaluated \nCalifornia\u2019s specific \u201cneed\u201d for GHG standards. In sum, \nin reconsidering SAFE 1, and after having now reviewed \nand evaluated the complete factual record, EPA reaffirms \nthat California needs the GHG standards and ZEV sales \nmandate at issue to \u201cmeet compelling and extraordinary \nconditions.\u201d\nA.\t Historical Practice\nUnder section 209(b)(1)(B), EPA shall not grant a \nwaiver if California \u201cdoes not need such State standards \nto meet compelling and extraordinary conditions.\u201d For \nnearly the entire history of the waiver program, EPA has \nread the phrase \u201csuch State standards\u201d in section 209(b)\n(1)(B) as referring back to standards \u201cin the aggregate,\u201d \nin the root paragraph of section 209(b)(1), which calls \nfor California to make a protectiveness finding for its \nstandards. EPA has interpreted the phrase \u201cin the \naggregate\u201d as referring to California\u2019s program as a \nwhole, rather than each State standard, and as such not \n\n156a\ncalling for the Agency\u2019s standard-by-standard analysis of \nCalifornia\u2019s waiver request.181 EPA has thus reasoned that \nboth statutory provisions must be read together so that \nthe Agency reviews the same standards that California \nconsiders in making its protectiveness determination and \nto afford California discretion.182 The D.C. Circuit has \nalso stated that \u201c[t]he expansive statutory language gives \nCalifornia (and in turn EPA) a good deal of flexibility in \nassessing California\u2019s regulatory needs. We therefore find \nno basis to disturb EPA\u2019s reasonable interpretation of the \nsecond criterion.\u201d183 \n181.\u2002  \u201cThe interpretation that my inquiry under (b)(1)(B) goes \nto California\u2019s need for its own mobile source program is borne out \nnot only by the legislative history, but by the plain meaning of the \nstatue as well.\u201d 49 FR at 18890. \n182.\u2002  74 FR at 32751 n. 44;.32761 n.104.

In 2008, EPA for the first time \nanalyzed California\u2019s waiver request under an alternative \napproach and denied CARB\u2019s waiver request. EPA concluded \nthat section 209(b) was intended to allow California to \npromulgate state standards applicable to emissions from \nnew motor vehicles to address air pollution problems that \nare local or regional, but that section 209(b)(1)(B) was not \nintended to allow California to promulgate state standards \nfor emissions from new motor vehicles designed to address \nglobal climate change problems. Or, in the alternative, \nEPA concluded that effects of climate change in California \nwere not compelling and extraordinary compared to the \neffects in the rest of the country.189 EPA rejected this view \na little over a year later in 2009 by applying the traditional \ninterpretation in granting California\u2019s waiver request for \nthe same GHG standard, finding no support in the statute \nor congressional intent for the alternative application of \nthe statute.190 \n188.\u2002  74 FR at 32763-65; 76 FR 34693; 79 FR 46256; 81 FR \n95982. \n189.\u2002  73 FR at 12160-64. \n190.\u2002  74 FR at 32744, 32746, 32763 (\u201cThe text of section 209(b) \nand the legislative history, when viewed together, lead me to reject \nthe interpretation adopted in the March 6, 2008 Denial, and to \napply the traditional interpretation to the evaluation of California\u2019s \ngreenhouse gas standards for motor vehicles.

The better interpretation of the text and legislative \nhistory of this provision is that Congress did not use this criterion \nto limit California\u2019s discretion to a certain category of air pollution \nproblems, to the exclusion of others.

CARB \nalso analyzed pathways to meeting California\u2019s long term 2050 GHG \nreduction targets in the light-duty vehicle sector and determined that \nZEVs would need to reach nearly 100 percent of new vehicle sales \nbetween 2040 and 2050. CARB also notes that the \u201ccritical nature \nof the LEV III regulation is also highlighted in the recent effort to \ntake a coordinated look at strategies to meet California\u2019s multiple \nair quality and climate goals well into the future. This coordinated \nplanning effort, Vision for Clean Air: A Framework for Air Quality \nand Climate Planning (Vision for Clean Air) demonstrates the \nmagnitude of the technology and energy transformation needed \nfrom the transportation sector and associated energy production \nto meet federal standards and the goals set forth by California\u2019s \nclimate change requirements. . . . The Vision for Clean Air effort \nillustrates that in addition to the cleanup of passenger vehicles (at \nissue here) as soon as possible as required in the LEV III regulation, \ntransition to zero- and near-zero emission technologies in all on- and \noff-road engine categories is necessary to achieve the coordinated \ngoals. Therefore, EPA believes that CARB\u2019s 2018 and later MY ZEV \nstandards represent a reasonable pathway to reach these longer \nterm goals. Under EPA\u2019s traditional practice of affording CARB the \nbroadest discretion possible, and deferring to CARB on its policy \nchoices, we believe there is a rational connection between California \nZEV standards and its attainment of long term air quality goals. \nWhether or not the ZEV standards achieve additional reductions \nby themselves above and beyond the LEV III GHG and criteria \npollutant standards, the LEV III program overall does achieve \nsuch reductions, and EPA defers to California\u2019s policy choice of the \nappropriate technology path to pursue to achieve these emissions \nreductions.\u201d (footnote omitted)). \n\n164a\n(B) called for a \u201cparticularized nexus\u201d for California\u2019s \nmotor vehicle standards: \u201cCongress enacted the waiver \nauthority for California under section 209(b) against the \nbackdrop of traditional, criteria pollutant environmental \nproblems, under which all three links in this chain bear a \nparticularized nexus to specific local California features: \n(1) Criteria pollutants are emitted from the tailpipes of the \nCalifornia motor vehicle fleet; (2) those emissions of criteria \npollutants contribute to air pollution by concentrating \nlocally in elevated ambient levels, which concentration, in \nturn; (3) results in health and welfare effects ( e.g., from \nozone) that are extraordinarily aggravated in California \nas compared to other parts of the country, with this \nextraordinary situation being attributable to a confluence \nof California\u2019s peculiar characteristics, e.g., population \ndensity, transportation patterns, wind and ocean currents, \ntemperature inversions, and topography.\u201d195 As support for \nthe nexus test, EPA, for the first time in waiver decisions, \nrelied on section 202(a) and its own terms of authority to \ninform interpretation of the second waiver prong.196 In \naddition, EPA relied on legislative history to interpret \n\u201ccompelling and extraordinary\u201d conditions as a reference \nto \u201cpeculiar local conditions\u201d and \u201cunique problems\u201d in \nCalifornia.197 Accordingly, EPA reasoned that California \n195.\u2002  84 FR at 51339. \n196.\u2002  Id. at 51339-40. \n197.\u2002  Id. at 51342 (quoting S.

The analysis below walks \nthrough the statutory language and history associated \nwith this provision. As part of this discussion, the \nrelationship of this provision and California\u2019s authority \nand deference is highlighted. The two interpretations \nof the waiver prong are then reviewed, presenting the \nAgency\u2019s rationale for its findings of the inappropriate \nSAFE 1 interpretation and support for its conclusion \nabout the better interpretation. Second, as shown below, \nthe factual record before the Agency at the time of SAFE \n1 supports the GHG standards and ZEV sales mandate \nrequirements at issue under either the traditional or \nSAFE 1 interpretation of section 209(b)(1)(B).\n1.\t EPA Is Withdrawing the SAFE 1 Section 209(b)(1)(B) \nInterpretation\nExcept for two short-lived exceptions in the context of \nthe 2008 waiver denial and SAFE 1, EPA has consistently \nSierra Nevada winter snowpack in 2014-2015, three of the five \ndeadliest wildfires in state history, and back-to-back years of the \nwarmest average temperatures on record.

As further explained below, all of these aspects \nlend support to the Agency practice of not subjecting \nCalifornia\u2019s waiver requests to review of the specific \nstandards under the second waiver prong, and we agree \nthat the traditional interpretation of section 209(b) is, at \nleast, the better interpretation.\nUnder section 209(b)(1)(B), EPA must grant a waiver \nrequest unless the Agency finds that California \u201cdoes \nnot need such State standards to meet compelling and \nextraordinary conditions.\u201d EPA has historically read the \nphrase \u201csuch State standards\u201d in section 209(b)(1)(B) as \nreferring back to standards \u201cin the aggregate\u201d in section \n209(b)(1), which addresses the protectiveness finding \nthat California must make for its waiver requests. In \naddition, as EPA has explained in the past, reading the \nprovision otherwise would conflict with Congress\u2019s 1977 \namendment to the waiver provision to allow California\u2019s \nstandards to be \u201cat least as protective\u201d as the federal \nstandards \u201cin the aggregate.\u201d This amendment must \nmean that some of California\u2019s standards may be weaker \nthan federal standards counterbalanced by others that \nare stronger. If, however, a waiver can only be granted if \neach standard on its own meets a compelling need, then \nCalifornia could never have a standard that is weaker \nthan the federal standard, rendering Congress\u2019s 1977 \n\n182a\namendment inoperative. Congress would not have created \nthe option for California\u2019s individual standards to be at \nleast as protective \u201cin the aggregate\u201d and then taken that \noption away in the second waiver prong\u2019s \u201ccompelling \nneed\u201d inquiry.\nIn addition, EPA has reasoned that giving effect to \nsection 209(b)(1) means that both subparagraph (b)(1)\n(B) and paragraph (b)(1) must be read together such that \nthe Agency reviews the same standards that California \nconsiders in making its protectiveness determination. \n\u201c\u00a7209 (formerly \u00a7208) was amended to require the U.S. \nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) to consider \nCalifornia\u2019s standards as a package, so that California \ncould seek a waiver of preemption if its standards \u2018in \nthe aggregate\u2019 protected public health at least as well as \nfederal standards.\u201d238 \nEPA has thus explained the reasoning for the reading \nof \u201csuch State standards\u201d for instance, as follows:\n[I]f Congress had intended a review of the \nneed for each individual standard under (b)(1)(B), \nit is unlikely that it would have used the phrase \n\u201c. . . does not need such state standards,\u201d which \napparently refers back to the phrase \u201cState \nstandards . . . in the aggregate,\u201d as used in the \nfirst sentence of section 209(b)(1), rather than \nto the particular standard being considered. \n238.\u2002  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Since \n1967, in various amendments to section 209, Congress has \nalso not disturbed this reading of section 209(b)(1)(B) as \ncalling for the review of the standards as a whole program. \nLikewise, Congress has also not placed any additional \nconstraints on California\u2019s ability to obtain waivers beyond \nthose now contained in section 209(b)(1). The Agency has \nthus viewed the text, legislative history, and structure of \nsection 209(b)(1) as support for the program-level review of \nwaiver requests as well for the conclusion that California\u2019s \nair quality need not be worse than the rest of the country \nfor EPA to grant a waiver of preemption.

Nevertheless, to the extent that \nSAFE 1 was intended to preclude all California regulation \nof greenhouse gases, EPA believes it improper to exclude \nentirely a pollutant from a waiver under section 209(b) \nthat is otherwise preempted by section 209(a). \nIn addition, Congress has cited California\u2019s GHG \nstandards and ZEV sales mandate in subsequent \nlegislation.

However, because the Agency \nasserted in SAFE 1 that the equal sovereignty doctrine \nformed a gloss on its statutory interpretation of the three \ncriteria, EPA addresses that argument here briefly. In short, \nin SAFE 1, EPA stated that because section 209(b)(1) \nprovides \u201cextraordinary treatment\u201d to California, the \nsecond waiver prong should be interpreted to require a \n\u201cstate-specific\u201d and \u201cparticularized\u201d pollution problem. 257 \nBut section 177\u2019s grant of authority to other states to adopt \nCalifornia\u2019s standards undermines the notion that the \nregulatory scheme treats California in an extraordinary \nmanner. Indeed, if section 209(b) is interpreted to limit the \ntypes of air pollution that California may regulate, it would \ndiminish the sovereignty of California and the states \nthat adopt California\u2019s standards pursuant to section \n177 without enhancing any other state\u2019s sovereignty. \nNor does section 209(b) impose any burden on any state. \nFor these reasons, EPA agrees with commenters who \nargued that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Shelby \nCounty is inapposite. In section 209(b), Congress did \nnot authorize \u201cfederal intrusion into sensitive areas of \nstate and local policymaking.\u201d258 Rather, it underscored a \nfoundational principle of federalism\u2014allowing California \nto be a laboratory for innovation. Nor is section 209(b) \nan \u201cextraordinary departure from the traditional \ncourse of relations between the States and the Federal \nGovernment.\u201d259 To the contrary, it is just one of many \n257.\u2002  84 FR 51340, 51347. \n258.\u2002  Shelby County v.

But nothing in section \n209(b)(1)(B) can be read as calling for scrutinizing the \nspecific California standards under the waiver.260 Under \nsection 209(b)(1)(B), EPA is to grant a waiver unless \nCalifornia does not need \u201csuch State standards\u201d (plural). \nEPA interprets section 209(b)(1)(B) to refer back to the \nphrase \u201cin the aggregate\u201d in section 209(b)(1), which was \nadded in the 1977 CAA Amendments when Congress \n260.\u2002  In the 2009 GHG waiver, and again in the 2013 ACC \nprogram waiver, EPA explained that the traditional approach does \nnot make section 209(b)(1)(B) a nullity, as EPA must still determine \nwhether California does not need its motor vehicle program to \nmeet compelling and extraordinary conditions as discussed in the \nlegislative history. Conditions in California may one day improve such \nthat it may no longer have a need for its motor vehicle program, or a \nprogram designed for a particular type of air pollution problem, if \nthe underlying specific air pollutant is no longer at issue. \n\n192a\nremoved the stringency requirements for waiver of \nCalifornia standards allowing instead for standards that \nare not as stringent as comparable federal standards, so \nlong as the standards were \u201cin the aggregate, at least \nas protective of public health and welfare as applicable \nFederal standards.\u201d EPA believes that referring back \nto section 209(b)(1) is appropriate given that it precedes \nthe language prior to section 209(b)(1)(B) and is in \naccord with the deference Congress intended by the 1977 \nAmendments.261 Conversely, EPA believes that under the \nSAFE 1 interpretation California would, of necessity, be \nrequired to make a protectiveness finding for each of the \nspecific standards, and the Agency believes this would be \nan inappropriate outcome from SAFE 1. Under the 1977 \nAmendments, California can \u201cinclude some less stringent \n[standards] than the corresponding federal standards.\u201d262 \nAs previously explained, \u201cCongress could not have given \nthis flexibility to California and simultaneously assigned \nto the state the seemingly impossible task of establishing \nthat \u2018extraordinary and compelling conditions\u2019 exist for \neach standard.\u201d263 \n261.\u2002  EPA had applied the traditional interpretation of the \nsecond waiver prong prior to the 1977 Amendments. \n262.\u2002  See H.R.

Indeed, section 209(b)(1)(C) \ninvolves an analysis of feasibility that can take more than \nthe feasibility and impacts of the new standards into \naccount. The feasibility assessment conducted for a new \nwaiver request focuses on the standards in that request \nbut builds on the previous feasibility assessments made \nfor the standards already in the program and assesses any \nnew feasibility risks created by the interaction between \nthe standards in the petition and the existing standards.265 \nIn sum, EPA now views as inconsistent with \ncongressional intent the SAFE 1 interpretation, which was \na flawed interpretation and also a significant departure \nfrom the traditional interpretation under which the \n264.\u2002  Section 209(b)(1)(C) provides that no such waiver shall \nbe granted if the Administrator finds that \u201csuch State standards \nand accompanying enforcement procedures are not consistent with \nsection 7521(a) [202(a)] of this title.\u201d \n265.\u2002  For example, in the 2013 ACC waiver that contains CARB\u2019s \nLEV III criteria pollutant standards and GHG emission standards, \nas well as the ZEV sales mandate, EPA assessed information \nsubmitted by CARB regarding the technological feasibility, lead \ntime available to meet the requirements, and the cost of compliance \nand the technical and resource challenges manufacturers face in \ncomplying with the requirements to simultaneously reduce criteria \nand GHG emissions. 78 FR at 2131. \n\n194a\nAgency reviews California\u2019s need for the same standards \nas those that the State determines are \u201cin the aggregate\u201d \nas protective of public health and welfare, under section \n209(b)(1).266 EPA believes the traditional interpretation \nis, at least, the better reading of the statute. \nAs previously explained, in reviewing waiver requests \nEPA has applied the traditional interpretation in the same \nway for all air pollutants, criteria and GHG pollutants \n266.\u2002  84 FR at 51345. EPA notes that in SAFE 1 the following \nrationale was used to interpret both 209(b)(1)(C) and then connect \nit with 209(b)(1)(B): \u201c[B]ecause both sections 209(b)(1)(B) and (C) \nemploy the term \u2018such state standards,\u2019 it is appropriate for EPA \nto read the term consistently between prongs (B) and (C). Under \nsection 209(b)(1)(C), EPA conducts review of standards California \nhas submitted to EPA for the grant of a waiver to determine if they \nare consistent with section 202(a). It follows then that EPA must read \n\u2018such state standards\u2019 in section 209(b)(1)(B) as a reference to the same \nstandards in subsection (C).\u201d Although the Agency has not pointed \nto 209(b)(1)(C) as a basis of statutory construction to support the \ntraditional interpretation of 209(b)(1)(B), EPA nevertheless believes \nit is supportive. EPA notes that the term \u201csuch state standards\u201d in \n209(b)(1)(C) allows the Agency, in appropriate circumstances, to \nreview the consistency of CARB\u2019s suite of standards, for a particular \nvehicle category, with section 202(a). For example, EPA evaluated all \nof the standards (LEV III criteria pollutant, ZEV sales mandate, and \nGHG standards) of the ACC program in recognition of the aggregate \ncosts and lead time associated with CARB\u2019s standards as well as \ntechnologies that may be employed to meet more than one standard. \n78 FR 2131-45. EPA\u2019s assessment under 209(b)(1)(C) is not in practice \na standard-by-standard review. EPA believes it appropriate to read \nthe entirety of 209 together, along with its purposes, in order to \nproperly interpret its components such as 209(b)(1)(B). \n\n195a\nalike.267 In SAFE 1, however, EPA reinterpreted section \n209(b)(1)(B) and further set out a particularized nexus \ntest and applied this test separately to GHG standards \nat issue. SAFE 1 then concluded that no nexus exists for \nGHG emissions in California.268 SAFE 1 further posited \nthat California must demonstrate \u201ccompelling and \nextraordinary circumstances sufficiently different from \nthe nation as a whole to justify standards on automobile \nemissions which may, from time to time, need to be more \nstringent than national standards.\u201d269 This has resulted \nin potentially different practical results depending on \nwhether GHG standards or criteria emission pollutants \nare at issue, a distinction neither found in nor supported \nby the text of section 209(b)(1)(B) and legislative history. \n267.\u2002  74 FR at 32763-65; 76 FR at 34693; 79 FR at 46256; 81 \nFR at 95982. \n268.\u2002  SAFE 1 also relied on UARG v. EPA, 134 S. Ct. 2427 \n(2014), where the Supreme Court disagreed with the Agency\u2019s \ndecision to regulate all sources of GHG under Titles I and V as the \nconsequence of the Agency\u2019s section 202(a) endangerment finding for \nmotor vehicle GHG emissions. In EPA\u2019s view upon reconsideration \nof SAFE 1, UARG is distinguishable because here the Agency is \nacting under a specific exemption to section 202(a) that allows for \nCalifornia to set its own standards for motor vehicle GHG standards \nunder California state law, and thus, regulate major sources of GHG \nemissions within the State. California\u2019s authority to promulgate \nstandards is neither contingent nor dependent on the Agency\u2019s \nsection 202(a) endangerment finding for GHG. See 74 FR at 32778-80; \n79 FR at 46262. Moreover, as discussed above, EPA\u2019s waiver authority \nunder section 209(b) is coextensive with preemption under section \n209(a). See MEMA I, 627 F.2d at 1107.

EPA concludes it erred by not properly \nevaluating the statutory interpretation of section 209, \nthe associated legislative history including the policy \ndeference that should be afforded to California to \naddress its serious air quality problems and to serve as \na laboratory for the country, and because the \u201cneed\u201d for \na motor vehicle emission program and related standards \nwithin the program are necessarily better viewed as a \ncomprehensive and interrelated effort to address the \nrange of air quality problems facing California.286 At the \n286.\u2002  As noted previously, in the context of evaluating the \n\u201cneed\u201d for California\u2019s motor vehicle emission standards the Agency \nis informed by the legislative history from 1967 and 1977, whereby \nCalifornia is properly viewed as a laboratory for the country and \nthat its policy decisions on how best to address its serious air quality \nissues, and that deference on the question of \u201cneed\u201d is in order. \nTherefore, EPA believes it misapplied the concept of deference in \nthe context of the second waiver prong application in SAFE 1. See \ne.g., 84 FR at 51344 n.268.

This is consistent \nwith EPA\u2019s longstanding waiver practice and its integration of the \nlegislative history behind section 209.

This long \nrange or global aspect of ozone and PM can have \nan impact on local or regional levels, as part of \nthe background in which the local or regional \nair pollution problem occurs.292 \nIn the context of implementing section 209(b)(1)(B) \nand assessing the \u201cneed\u201d for California\u2019s standards even \n292.\u2002  78 FR at 2128-29.

Furthermore, wildfires can increase particulate \nair pollution in the major air basins of California. Together, these \nconsequences of climate change could offset air quality improvements \nthat have successfully reduced dangerous ozone concentrations. \nGiven this \u201cclimate penalty,\u201d as it is commonly called, air quality \nimprovement efforts in many of California\u2019s air basins will need to \nbe strengthened as temperatures increase in order to reach existing \nair quality goals.\u201d). \n\n205a\nunder the SAFE 1 interpretation, EPA sees no reason \nto distinguish between \u201clocal or regional\u201d air pollutants \nversus other pollutants that may be more globally mixed. \nRather, it is appropriate to acknowledge that all pollutants \nand their effects may play a role in creating air pollution \nproblems in California and that EPA should provide \ndeference to California in its comprehensive policy choices \nfor addressing them. Again, even if a new interpretation of \nsection 209(b)(1)(B) were appropriate in SAFE 1, and EPA \nbelieves it is not, it is important to note that historically, \ncriteria pollutant reductions have been relevant to section \n209(b)(1)(B). As previously noted, nothing in section 209(b) \ncan be read as calling for EPA to waive preemption only \nif California seeks to enforce criteria pollutant standards. \nThe Administrator is required to waive the preemption \nin section 209(a) unless California \u201cdoes not need such \nState standards to meet compelling and extraordinary \nconditions.\u201d293 As also previously noted this is in stark \ncontrast to, for example, section 211(c)(4)(C), which calls for \na waiver of preemption only if a state demonstrates that \na fuel program will result in criteria pollutant reductions \nthat will enable achievement of applicable NAAQS. \nThe first section below focuses on criteria pollution \nreduction, which has long been relevant to section 209\n(b)(1)(B). EPA has never put in doubt that California\u2019s \nserious criteria air pollution problems (such as NAAQS \nnonattainment and the factors that give rise to those \nconditions, including the geographic and climate conditions \nin the State, the number of motor vehicles in California, \n293.\u2002  CAA section 209(b)(1)(B) (emphasis added). \n\n206a\nand local and regional air quality) are \u201ccompelling and \nextraordinary,\u201d or that California \u201cneeds\u201d regulations \nthat address such emissions in order to achieve every \nfraction of criteria pollutant emissions it can achieve.294 \nThe factual record before the Agency in 2013 and again \nin 2019 includes ample documentation of criteria emission \nreductions from California\u2019s GHG standards and ZEV \nsales mandate.295 Nothing in the record is sufficient to \ndemonstrate that California does not need the ACC \nprogram (or the motor vehicle emission program) or, in \nthe context of the SAFE 1 interpretation, the specific \nGHG emission standards and the ZEV sales mandate to \nmeet compelling needs related to criteria pollution. These \nbenefits have a clear connection to California\u2019s \u201cneed\u201d for \nits specific GHG standards and ZEV sales mandate, at \nissue under the waiver. The second section below focuses \non the GHG reduction benefits of California\u2019s GHG \nstandards and ZEV sales mandate. EPA acknowledges \nthat California is particularly impacted by climate change, \nincluding increasing risks from record-setting fires, \n294.\u2002  In SAFE 1, EPA found that California\u2019s criteria pollution \nconditions remain \u201ccompelling and extraordinary and that California \nneeds standards to produce any and all reductions in criteria \npollutant emissions.\u201d 84 FR at 51344, 51346. \n295.\u2002  When California originally adopted a ZEV sales mandate \ninto its regulations, a significant factor in support of its action \nwas addressing criteria pollutant emissions. In SAFE 1 EPA \nacknowledged that California\u2019s ZEV mandate initially targeted \nonly criteria pollution. 84 FR at 51329. EPA\u2019s 2013 waiver grant \nrecognized that with California\u2019s ACC program California had \nshifted to relying on the ZEV requirements to reduce both criteria \nand GHG pollution. 78 FR at 2114. \n\n207a\nheat waves, storm surges, sea-level rise, water supply \nshortages and extreme heat, and that climate-change \nimpacts in California are therefore \u201ccompelling and \nextraordinary conditions\u201d for which California needs the \nGHG standards and ZEV sales mandate. \na.\t GHG Standards and ZEV Sales Mandates Have \nCriteria Emission Benefits\nAs shown below, criteria pollutant reductions are \ndemonstrably connected to California\u2019s \u201cneed\u201d for its \nGHG standards and ZEV sales mandate at issue under \nthe waiver.296 EPA first concluded that there is a \u201clogical \nlink between the local air pollution problem of ozone and \nGHGs\u201d in the 2009 California GHG waiver by explaining, \n296.\u2002  In response to comments arguing that upstream emission \nbenefits should not be considered in determining the criteria \npollutant benefits of CARB\u2019 standards or that it is inappropriate to \nelevate stationary source criteria pollutant emissions into a make-\nor-break factor in waivers for motor vehicle emission programs, \nEPA believes it appropriate to reiterate the air quality problems \nfacing California, as evidenced by NAAQS attainment challenges. \nWaiver practice and applicable case law, as previously noted, afford \nCalifornia wide deference in its policy and regulatory approaches \nin addressing these challenges. Therefore, EPA believes that to \nthe degree a nexus between CARB\u2019s standards and addressing its \nserious air quality problems is required, that it is reasonable to base \nthe need on related criteria emission impacts. EPA notes that, in \nsetting its federal light-duty vehicle GHG standards, it is afforded \ndiscretion under the CAA to consider upstream emission impacts \nand does include such consideration in its own rulemakings. 77 FR \n62624, 62819 (October 15, 2012) (taking fuel related upstream GHG \nemissions into account in setting compliance values for vehicle GHG \nemissions standards). \n\n208a\nfor instance, that \u201cthe impacts of global climate change can \nnevertheless exacerbate this local air pollution problem.\u201d297 \nMoreover, as previously explained, in two additional GHG \nwaiver requests and associated EPA waiver decisions since \nthe 2009 GHG waiver, EPA acknowledged that CARB had \ndemonstrated the need for GHG standards to address \ncriteria pollutant concentrations in California. In the 2014 \nHD GHG waiver request, CARB projected, for example, \n\u201creductions in NO X emissions of 3.1 tons per day in 2014 \nand one ton per day in 2020\u201d in California.298 \n297.\u2002  74 FR at 32763. According to California, \u201cCalifornia\u2019s \nhigh ozone levels-clearly a condition Congress considered-will be \nexacerbated by higher temperatures from global warming . . . [T]here \nis general consensus that temperature increases from climate change \nwill exacerbate the historic climate, topography, and population \nfactors conducive to smog formation in California, which were the \ndriving forces behind Congress\u2019s inclusion of the waiver provision \nin the Clean Air Act.\u201d Id. (quoting comments submitted by CARB \nduring the 2009 reconsideration). CARB also explained that \u201cthe \nfactors that cause ozone are primarily local in nature and [] ozone \nis a local or regional air pollution problem, the impacts of global \nclimate change can nevertheless exacerbate this local air pollution \nproblem. Whether or not local conditions are the primary cause of \nelevated concentrations of greenhouse gases and climate change, \nCalifornia has made a case that its greenhouse gas standards are \nlinked to amelioration of California\u2019s smog problems . . . . There is \na logical link between the local air pollution problem of ozone and \nCalifornia\u2019s desire to reduce GHGs as one way to address the adverse \nimpact that climate change may have on local ozone conditions.\u201d Id. \n298.\u2002  79 FR at 46261.

EPA explained that CARB had linked those \nprior waived GHG standards to criteria pollutant benefits \nbut had not done so in the ACC program waiver request: \n\u201cCalifornia\u2019s approach in its ACC program waiver request \ndiffered from the state\u2019s approach in its waiver request \nfor MY 2011 and subsequent heavy-duty tractor-trailer \nGHG standards, where California quantified NO X \nemissions reductions attributed to GHG standards and \nexplained that they would contribute to PM and ozone \nNAAQS attainment.\u201d299 Moreover, how CARB attributes \nthe pollution reductions for accounting purposes from \nits various standards does not reflect the reality of how \nthe standards deliver emissions reductions and should \nnot drive whether or not a waiver can be withdrawn. \nEPA believes, based on its historical deference to CARB \nin waiver proceedings, that CARB is entitled to this \ndiscretion. \nEPA also believes that prior waiver decisions indicate \nthat the \u201capproach\u201d taken by California in its waiver \nrequests needs to be carefully assessed and understood \nby the Agency before discounting the benefits of its \nmobile source emission standards. The characterization of \nCARB\u2019s \u201capproach,\u201d as not calling out criteria emissions \nbenefits (such as upstream criteria emission benefits) \nof GHG standards, was incorrect and should not have \n299.\u2002  84 FR at 51337 n.252 (citing 79 FR at 46256, 46257 n.15, \n46261, 46262 n.75). \n\n210a\nundermined EPA\u2019s findings and grant of the initial ACC \nprogram waiver request for the following reasons: (1) \nAs previously noted, the ACC program standards are \ninterrelated and all serve to reduce both criteria and \nGHG pollution; (2) CARB conducted a combined emissions \nanalysis of the elements of the ACC program because the \nprogram was designed to work as an integrated whole; \nand (3) EPA has always considered California\u2019s standards \nas a whole or \u201cin the aggregate\u201d under the traditional \ninterpretation of section 209(b)(1)(B).300 EPA noted the \nassociated criteria pollutant and GHG emissions benefits \nfor the whole ACC program: \u201cthe ACC program will \nresult in reductions of both criteria pollutants and GHG \nemissions that, in the aggregate, are more protective than \nthe pre-existing federal standards.\u201d301 EPA also made the \nrequisite finding that California\u2019s protectiveness finding \nfor the ACC program was not arbitrary and capricious, \nunder section 209(b)(1)(A), by explaining that \u201cCalifornia\u2019s \nZEV and GHG emission standards are an addition to its \nLEV program.\u201d302 \nIn SAFE 1, EPA further asserted that \u201cCalifornia\u2019s \nresponses to the SAFE proposal do not rebut the Agency\u2019s \nviews that the ZEV standards for MY 2021-2025 are \ninextricably interconnected with the design and purpose \n300.\u2002  ZEV ISOR, EPA-HQ-OAR-2012-0562-0008 at 72; CARB \nSupplemental Comments, EPA-HQ-OAR-2012-0562-0373 at 3. \n301.\u2002  74 FR at 2122. \n302.\u2002  Id. at 2125. \n\n211a\nof California\u2019s overall GHG reduction strategy.\u201d303 For the \nfollowing reasons, however, EPA was also incorrect in the \nassessment of criteria emission benefits of CARB\u2019s ZEV \nsales mandate. EPA focused on only the following snippet \nfrom one salient paragraph in CARB\u2019s 2012 waiver request \nas support for the lack of criteria emissions benefits: \n\u201cThere is no criteria emissions benefit from including \nthe ZEV proposal in terms of vehicle (tank-to-wheel or \nTTW) emissions. The LEV III criteria pollutant fleet \nstandard is responsible for those emission reductions in \nthe fleet; the fleet would become cleaner regardless of \nthe ZEV regulation because manufacturers would adjust \ntheir compliance response to the standard by making less \npolluting conventional vehicles.\u201d304 But, as discussed above, \nthat was merely an attribution of benefits and did not \nreflect the practical reality of how California\u2019s standards \nwork. Moreover, the paragraph in its entirety goes on to \nexplain that CARB\u2019s ZEV sales mandate would achieve \ncriteria emission reductions: \u201cHowever, since upstream \ncriteria and PM emissions are not captured in the LEV \nIII criteria pollutant standard, net upstream emissions \nare reduced through the increased use of electricity and \nconcomitant reductions in fuel production.\u201d305 \n303.\u2002  84 FR at 51337. \n304.\u2002  Id. at 51337, 51330, 51337, 51353-54, 51356, 51358. \n305.\u2002  2012 Waiver Request at 15-16. CARB also noted that \ncriteria and PM emission benefits will vary by region throughout \nthe State depending on the location of emission sources. Refinery \nemission reductions will occur primarily in the east Bay Area and \nSouth Coast region where existing refinery facilities operate. As \nrefinery operations reduce production and emissions, the input \n\n212a\nIt bears note that this attribution of criteria pollutant \nreductions was similar to the one that CARB made \nalmost a decade ago for the 2009 GHG waiver request.306 \nFor example, CARB provided \u201cextensive evidence of \nits current and serious air quality problems and the \nincreasingly stringent health-based air quality standards \nand federally required state planning efforts to meet \nthose standards firmly.\u201d307 The States and Cities also \ncommented that \u201cthe attribution CARB made as part \nof its waiver request was never intended to, and did not, \nestablish the absence of any vehicular emission benefits \nfrom the ZEV standard.\u201d EPA believes that CARB\u2019s \nstatement was merely a \u201csimplification that distinguished \nthe standards based on the primary objectives of the \ntwo, complementary standards.\u201d308 EPA agrees that the \nand output activities, such as truck and ship deliveries, will also \ndecline. This includes crude oil imported through the Los Angeles \nand Oakland ports, as well as pipeline and local gasoline truck \ndistribution statewide.

Ample record support exists on \nCalifornia\u2019s need for both GHG standards and ZEV sales \nmandate at issue to address compelling and extraordinary \nconditions in California. As noted above, in SAFE 1 EPA, \nhowever, relied on an excerpt of the ACC program waiver \nrecord to determine the lack of criteria emission benefits \nof GHG emission standards and ZEV sales mandate at \nissue.

EPA believes that the \nburden of proof had not been met in SAFE 1, based on the \ncomplete factual record, to demonstrate that California \ndid not have a need for the GHG standards and ZEV sales \nmandate under the SAFE 1 interpretation of the second \nwaiver prong nor had the burden been met to support a \n339.\u2002  Ford Motor Co. v.

EPA confirms the traditional \ninterpretation of section 209(b)(1)(B) was appropriate \nand continues to be, at least, a better interpretation \nregardless of the recission of the SAFE 1 interpretation \nof this criterion.341 \nVI.\tEPA Inappropriately Considered Preemption Under \nthe Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) in \nIts Waiver Decision\nSAFE 1\u2019s other justification for withdrawing the ACC \nprogram waiver was that California\u2019s GHG standards \nand ZEV sales mandate were preempted under EPCA. \nAs explained in detail in Section IV, EPA believes this \nbasis for reconsideration was outside the appropriate \nbounds of EPA\u2019s authority to reconsider previously \ngranted waivers. In particular, if EPA could reconsider \nand withdraw a waiver based on a factor not contained \nin the specified criteria for denial in section 209(b)(1), \nEPA could circumvent the specified criteria for denial via \nreconsideration of previously granted waiver.\nEven if it were appropriate for EPA to reconsider a \npreviously granted waiver based on non-statutory factors, \nin this action, EPA concludes that it was inappropriate to \n341.\u2002  See 84 FR at 51344 n.269. \n\n228a\nrely on preemption under EPCA as a basis for withdrawing \ncertain aspects of the ACC program waiver. In SAFE 1, a \njoint action between NHTSA and EPA, NHTSA concluded \nthat state or local regulations of tailpipe carbon dioxide \nemissions are \u201crelated to fuel economy standards\u201d and \nare therefore preempted under EPCA.342 As a direct \nresult of NHTSA\u2019s codified text and pronouncements on \npreemption set forth in SAFE 1, EPA withdrew the ACC \nprogram waiver for California\u2019s GHG standards and ZEV \nsales mandate on grounds that they were preempted under \nEPCA. In SAFE 1, EPA believed it was appropriate to \nconsider the effect of NHTSA\u2019s actions, including the \nview that California cannot enforce standards that are \nvoid ab initio, and thus EPA stated that \u201cto the extent \nthat administrative action is necessary on EPA\u2019s part to \nreflect that state of affairs, EPA hereby withdraws that \nprior grant of a waiver on this basis.\u201d343 NHTSA has \nsince issued a new final rule that formally repeals the \n342.\u2002  49 U.S.C. 32919(a) (\u201cWhen an average fuel economy \nstandard prescribed under this chapter is in effect, a State or a \npolitical subdivision of a State may not adopt or enforce a law or \nregulation related to fuel economy standards or average fuel economy \nstandards for automobiles covered by an average fuel economy \nstandard under this chapter.\u201d). NHTSA noted that a law or regulation \nhaving the direct or substantial effect of regulating or prohibiting \ntailpipe carbon dioxide emissions from automobiles or automobile \nfuel economy is a law or regulation related to fuel economy standards \nand expressly preempted under 49 U.S.C. 32919(a). 84 FR at 51317-\n18. NHTSA\u2019s rule was codified at 49 CFR 531.7 (\u201cPreemption\u201d) and \n533.7 (\u201cPreemption\u201d), as well as each Appendix B in 49 CFR part \n531 (\u201cAPPENDIX B TO PART 531\u2014PREEMPTION\u201d) and Part 533 \n(\u201cAPPENDIX B TO PART 533\u2014PREEMPTION\u201d). \n343.\u2002  84 FR at 51338. \n\n229a\ncodified text and pronouncements regarding preemption \nunder EPCA found in SAFE 1. Upon reconsideration, \nEPA now believes that, given NHTSA\u2019s repeal of its \nregulation and pronouncements in SAFE 1, preemption \nunder EPCA cannot serve as a basis for the withdrawal of \nthe ACC program waiver as it did in SAFE 1\u2014if it could \never legitimately serve as such basis. EPA thus believes \nit is appropriate to rescind the portion of the waiver \nwithdrawal that was based on preemption under EPCA. \nIn addition, given the unique consideration of \npreemption under EPCA in SAFE 1 and its effect on an \notherwise validly issued waiver under the CAA, EPA \nbelieves it is helpful to provide additional information \nregarding the Agency\u2019s historical practice and views \nto demonstrate why consideration of preemption under \nEPCA was inappropriate. Consideration of preemption \nunder EPCA is beyond the statutorily prescribed criteria \nfor EPA in section 209(b)(1). Preemption under EPCA \nwas not a factor that California addressed under the \napplicable waiver criteria in its initial request nor was it a \nfactor that EPA considered in granting the ACC program \nwaiver. Until SAFE 1, the Agency consistently refrained \nfrom reviewing waiver requests against factors beyond \nthe statutorily listed criteria under section 209(b)(1). \nThus, EPA also believes that in the reconsideration of a \nwaiver where EPA had previously declined to consider \npreemption under EPCA, SAFE 1 was contrary to \ncongressional intent and the Agency\u2019s historic practice of \nhewing to section 209(b)(1) statutory criteria in reviewing \nwaiver requests. Given this backdrop, EPA believes that \nthe joint rulemaking context of SAFE 1 was an improper \n\n230a\nbasis to deviate from EPA\u2019s long held belief to not consider \nfactors outside the scope of section 209(b)(1), especially \ngiven that the Agency indicated it would only be a \nsingular occurrence. EPA continues to view the text and \ncongressional intent of the statute, as well as subsequent \ncase law, as best supporting a limited scope of review for \nwaiver requests under section 209(b)(1)\u2014irrespective of \nwhether a waiver proceeding is undertaken either solely \nby EPA or in unison with another agency. Therefore, based \non EPA\u2019s historical practice of not considering factors \noutside of the section 209(b)(1) criteria and because EPA \nbelieves the \u201cjoint-action\u201d premise was improper, the \nAgency is rescinding its withdrawal of the ACC program \nwaiver based on preemption under EPCA.\nA.\t Historical Practice and Legislative History\nHistorically, in reviewing California\u2019s waiver requests, \nEPA has refrained from the consideration of factors \nbeyond those criteria set out in section 209(b)(1).344 \n344.\u2002  See, e.g., 43 FR at 32184 (rejecting objections to the \nprocedures at state level, objections that section 207(c)(3)(A) \nestablishes field protection, and constitutional objections all as \nbeyond the \u201cnarrow\u201d scope of the Administrator\u2019s review); 74 FR \nat 32783 (rejecting comments asking for the consideration of EPCA \nbecause it is not one of the three statutorily prescribed criteria); 78 \nFR at 2145 (again rejecting comments asking for the consideration \nof EPCA because it is outside the statutory criteria); 79 FR at \n46265 (rejecting the argument that the HD GHG Regulations \n\u201cimpermissibly regulate fuel economy\u201d because, like the commerce \nclause and Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of \n1994 (FAAAA) issues, this issue is \u201coutside the proper scope of \nreview since it is not among the criteria listed under section 209(b).\u201d). \n\n231a\nEPA has generally explained that the text, structure, \nand purpose of the California waiver provision indicate \ncongressional intent for EPA to provide significant \ndeference to California\u2019s judgment, especially on \n\u201cambiguous and controversial matters of public policy.\u201d345 \nIn section 209(a), Congress generally preempted state \nstandards relating to the control of emissions from \nnew motor vehicles and engines, but, in section 209(b), \nCongress carved out an exception for California, directing \nEPA to grant California a waiver of section 209(a) unless \nthe Agency can make a finding under section 209(b). \nCongress recognized that California\u2019s \u201ccompelling \nand extraordinary circumstances,\u201d and its historical \npractice of regulating in the area, were sufficient \u201cto \njustify standards on automobile emissions which may, \nfrom time to time, need be more stringent than national \nstandards.\u201d346 In creating the waiver program, Congress \nintended not only for California to be able to meet its own \nemission reduction needs, but also for California to act \nas \u201ca kind of laboratory for innovation\u201d for motor vehicle \nstandards and control technology.\u201d347 Thus \u201cCongress \n345.\u2002  78 FR at 2112, 2115; 40 FR at 23103-04; 58 FR 4166. \n346.\u2002  H.R.

He has no \u2018broad and impressive\u2019 authority \nto modify California regulations.\u201d354 The court further \nnoted that \u201cthere is no such thing as a \u2018general duty\u2019 on \nan administrative agency to make decisions based on \nfactors other than those Congress expressly or impliedly \n352.\u2002  See, e.g., 74 FR at 32783; 78 FR at 2145. \n353.\u2002  MEMA II, 142 F.3d at 463. \n354.\u2002  MEMA 1, 627 F.2d at 1119 (internal citations omitted). \n\n234a\nintended the agency to consider.\u201d355 Similarly, the court \nhas stated that \u201c[t]he statute does not provide for any \nprobing substantive review of the California standards \nby federal officials\u201d and that \u201cEPA\u2019s only role is to review \nCalifornia\u2019s proposed rules under a narrowly defined set \nof statutory criteria.\u201d356 Thus, the court has consistently \nrejected arguments requiring EPA to consider factors \noutside of the statutory criteria. In MEMA I, the \ncourt rejected a constitutional objection to a waiver, \nexplaining that, because \u201cthe Administrator operates in \na narrowly circumscribed proceeding requiring no broad \npolicy judgments on constitutionally sensitive matters,\u201d \n\u201c[n]othing in section 209 requires him to consider the \nconstitutional ramifications of the regulations for which \nCalifornia requests a waiver . . . although nothing in section \n209 categorically forbids\u201d it. 357 In the same case, the court \nalso rejected an antitrust objection as outside the scope \nof the Administrator\u2019s review.358 The court again upheld \nEPA\u2019s decision to not consider constitutional objections in \nAmerican Trucking Association (ATA) v. EPA, stating, \n\u201cWe agree with EPA that ATA is seeking \u2018improperly to \nengraft a type of constitutional Commerce Clause analysis \n355.\u2002  Id. at 1116-17. \n356.\u2002  Ford Motor Co. v.

Some commenters agreed that the context of a \njoint action necessitated consideration of preemption under \nEPCA because NHTSA was the agency charged with \ninterpreting and implementing EPCA and so EPA must \nconsider its findings in the same action.374 One commenter \nalso argued that the joint rulemaking of SAFE 1 would be \nconsistent with pronouncements in Massachusetts v. EPA \n(2007) on the agencies\u2019 respective statutory obligations \nand the need to avoid inconsistency and so, \u201c[o]nce NHTSA \nproposed to finalize a determination that EPCA preempts \nCalifornia\u2019s GHG motor vehicle standards, it would be \nunreasonable for the EPA to refuse to take NHTSA\u2019s \naction into account.\u201d375 \nOther commenters argued that the context of the \nrulemaking, whether joint or not, was irrelevant. One \ncommenter stated emphatically that \u201cwhat Congress \ndirected EPA to consider when it wrote Section 209(b)(1) \ndoes not change depending on whether EPA acts alone or \nwith another agency.\u201d376 Some commenters also argued \nthat the context of the rulemaking was a particularly \ninsufficient justification for revoking the waiver given \nlanguage in SAFE 1 that allowed for inconsistent \nconsideration of EPCA preemption. Several commenters \nnoted that EPA constrained the future applicability of \nSAFE 1 by explaining that the Agency would not consider \nfactors outside statutory criteria in future waiver reviews \n374.\u2002  See, e.g., CEI at 11-12; AFPM at 2, 6. \n375.\u2002  CEI at 11. \n376.\u2002  States and Cities at 20.

Commenters argued that EPA\u2019s \nauthority to look outside the statutory criteria at EPCA \nwas at least permissive, if not mandatory. According to \none commenter, \u201cEPA exaggerates the Court\u2019s position\u201d \nin MEMA I in its Reconsideration notice: \u201c[T]he court did \nnot say that the EPA is forbidden to take constitutional \nramifications into consideration, only that it is not required \nto do so.\u201d379 Another commenter agreed that MEMA I \nand MEMA II \u201cdo not preclude EPA from considering\u201d \npreemption under EPCA but then went further, saying \nthat \u201cEPA is required to consider EPCA preemption.\u201d380 \nThe commenter argued that MEMA I rejected petitioners\u2019 \nconstitutional objections to a waiver under an institutional \n377.\u2002  NESCAUM at 3; Twelve Public Interest Organizations \nat app. 1 64-65; States and Cities at 20. \n378.\u2002  SCAQMD at 7 (quoting 86 FR at 22439, n.40). \n379.\u2002  CEI at 10 (original emphasis). \n380.\u2002  AFPM at 5-6. \n\n241a\ncompetence line of reasoning, concluding that \u201c[t]he \nwaiver proceeding produces a forum ill-suited to the \nresolution of constitutional claims.\u201d381 In contrast, they \ncontinued, the waiver proceeding is an appropriate forum \nfor determining whether emission standards \u201crelate to\u201d \nfuel economy because this issue is \u201cwithin the agency\u2019s \ncompetence, as this relationship is mathematical and based \nin science rather than understandings of Constitutional \nlaw and precedent.\u201d382 However, the other commenter, \nwho agreed that EPA is not \u201cforbidden\u201d from considering \npreemption under EPCA, also noted that EPA \u201chas no \nspecial competence to interpret EPCA.\u201d383 \nSeveral commenters also argued that EPA could not \nreinstate the waiver because NHTSA concluded that \nEPCA preempts the standards, such standards were void \nab initio, and therefore \u201cthe state mandates referenced \nin CA\u2019s petition for reconsideration are not even eligible \nto be considered for a CAA waiver of preemption.\u201d384 To \n381.\u2002  Id. at 6 (quoting MEMA I, 627 F.2d 1095, 1114-15 (DC \nCir. 1979)). \n382.\u2002  Id. \n383.\u2002  CEI at 11. \n384.\u2002  NADA at 3-4; See also AFPM at 3 (\u201cSince California\u2019s \nGHG tailpipe standards and ZEV mandate are related to fuel \neconomy, they are not lawfully adopted and void ab initio \u2014and \nthere is nothing for EPA to reinstate.\u201d); Urban Air at 47-48; CEI at \n2 (\u201cBut EPCA preemption is the proverbial elephant in the room. \nIf SAFE 1\u2019s EPCA preemption argument is correct, the EPA could \nnot grant a valid CAA preemption waiver for California\u2019s tailpipe \nCO 2 standards and ZEV mandates, because EPCA had already \n\n242a\nignore this, they claimed, would violate the Supremacy \nClause of the Constitution.

Furthermore, given the context of EPA\u2019s \nreconsideration of the ACC program waiver at the time \nof SAFE 1, the Agency believes it was inappropriate to \nreconsider the validity of the waiver against criteria such \nas preemption under EPCA. In this action, based on the \ntwo independent grounds noted above, the Agency is \nrescinding the portion of SAFE 1 that withdrew the ACC \nprogram waiver based on preemption under EPCA. \n1.\t NHTSA Has Since Repealed Its Findings of \nPreemption Made in SAFE 1\nIn the Notice of Reconsideration, EPA sought comment \non the Agency\u2019s reliance on NHTSA\u2019s preemption findings \nas a basis for its withdrawal of the ACC program waiver \nin SAFE 1.

Specifically, NHTSA has issued a new final \nrule that formally repeals the codified text and additional \npronouncements regarding preemption under EPCA \nfound in SAFE 1.394 In SAFE 1, EPA stated that it was \nappropriate to consider the effect of NHTSA\u2019s actions, \nincluding the view that California cannot enforce \nstandards that are void ab initio and thus EPA stated \nthat \u201cto the extent that administrative action is necessary \non EPA\u2019s part to reflect that state of affairs, EPA hereby \nwithdraws that prior grant of a waiver on this basis.\u201d395 \nSince this condition no longer exists, EPA believes it is \nappropriate to rescind the waiver withdrawal that was \n393.\u2002  86 FR at 22429. \n394.\u2002  86 FR 74236. NHTSA notes in this rulemaking that \u201cthe \nAgency is repealing all regulatory text and appendices promulgated \nin the SAFE I Rule. In doing so, the Agency underscores that any \npositions announced in preambulatory statements of prior NHTSA \nrulemakings, including in the SAFE I Rule, which purported \nto define the scope of preemption under the Energy Policy and \nConservation Act (EPCA), do not reflect the Agency\u2019s reconsidered \nunderstanding of its proper role in matters of EPCA preemption.\u201d \n395.\u2002  EPA distinguished these previous single-agency actions \nfrom its joint action context by explaining that ignoring NHTSA\u2019s \ndetermination of preemption in the same action, \u201cwould place the \nUnited States Government in the untenable position of arguing that \none federal agency can resurrect a State provision that, as another \nfederal agency has concluded and codified, Congress has expressly \npreempted and therefore rendered void ab initio.\u201d 84 FR at 51338. \n\n246a\nbased on preemption under EPCA. EPA believes that, \nto the extent it was ever appropriate for the Agency to \nbase its action on NHTSA\u2019s finding of preemption under \nEPCA in SAFE 1, the repeal of the preemption rule makes \nit likewise appropriate to rescind the Agency\u2019s action \nin SAFE 1. This would also act to minimize regulatory \nuncertainty as to do otherwise would create further \nconfusion that resulted from the joint action in SAFE \n1 and would not appropriately reflect the current state \nof affairs under the circumstances of a unique federal \nregulation that had otherwise motivated EPA\u2019s actions \nin SAFE 1. NHTSA\u2019s recent action also supports EPA\u2019s \nbelief that its practice of limiting its review of section \n209(b) criteria, as explained below, remains appropriate \nin the context of preemption under EPCA. \n2.\t EPA Improperly Deviated From Its Historical \nPractice of Limiting Its Review to Section 209(b) \nCriteria\nSection 209(b)(1) of the Act limits the Agency\u2019s \nauthority to deny California\u2019s requests for waivers to \nthe three criteria contained therein and the Agency \nhas consistently refrained from reviewing California\u2019s \nrequests for waivers based on any other criteria. EPA \nacknowledges that California adopts its standards as \na matter of law under its state police powers, that the \nAgency\u2019s task in reviewing waiver requests is limited to \nevaluating California\u2019s request according to the criteria \nin section 209(b), and that it is appropriate to defer to \nlitigation brought by third parties in other courts, such \nas state or federal district court, for the resolution of any \n\n247a\nconstitutionality claims and assertions of inconsistency \nwith other statutes. Considering the lack of statutory and \nprecedential support as shown below, even if EPA were \nto have discretion to consider criteria outside section \n209(b), EPA now views the joint-action context of SAFE \n1 as an insufficient justification for deviating from its \nstatutory authority and the Agency\u2019s historical practice \nand therefore the Agency rescinds its actions regarding \npreemption under EPCA in SAFE 1. \nWithdrawal of the waiver was premised on NHTSA\u2019s \npreemption regulations in what EPA explained was a \njoint rulemaking action. But nothing in section 209(b) \ncan be read as calling for consideration of preemption \nunder EPCA in evaluating waiver requests regardless of \nwhether EPA engaged in joint rulemaking with another \nagency or acted alone. Specifically, under section 209(b), \nEPA must grant California a waiver of the preemption \ncontained in section 209(a) unless the Administrator \nmakes a finding under any one of the listed criteria: \n\u201cThe Administrator shall . . . waive application of the \npreemption in section 209(a) if the Administrator finds \nany of the following: \u2018(A) [California\u2019s] determination \n[that its standards in the aggregate will be at least as \nprotective] is arbitrary and capricious, (B) [California] \ndoes not need such State standards to meet compelling and \nextraordinary conditions, or (C) such State standards and \naccompanying enforcement procedures are not consistent \nwith section [202(a)].\u2019\u201d396 Evaluation of preemption under \nEPCA is not a listed criterion. \n396.\u2002  CAA section 209(b)(1)(A)-(C). \n\n248a\nNor did SAFE 1 premise preemption under EPCA on \nany of the three statutory criteria. In the ACC program \nwaiver request, CARB made a protectiveness finding \nthat, as a quantitative matter, its standards, in the \naggregate, were as protective as the Federal standards \nand did not address preemption under EPCA.397 In \nfact, while California might opt to respond to comments \non preemption under EPCA, California would not be \nexpected to take it into account in any protectiveness \nfinding made for a waiver request. It bears note that \nCalifornia\u2019s practice is not unusual because there are \nother factors and provisions of the CAA that California \ndoes not account for in making its protectiveness finding \nunder section 209(b)(1).398 In granting the ACC program \nwaiver request, EPA found that California\u2019s protectiveness \nfinding was neither arbitrary nor capricious.399 EPA \nalso responded to comments on the consideration of \npreemption under EPCA in granting the waiver but \ndismissed such objections as outside the scope of its \nreview.400 Historically, EPA draws a comparison between \nthe numerical stringency of California and federal \nstandards in making the requisite finding as to whether \nCalifornia\u2019s protectiveness determination is arbitrary and \n397.\u2002  2012 Waiver Request at 15-17. \n398.\u2002  For example, \u201cCalifornia is not required to comply with \nsection 207 to get a waiver.\u201d MEMA II, 142 F.3d 449, 467 (D.C.

As SAFE 1 also \nacknowledged, however, EPA does not \u201cadminister\u201d \nEPCA; that task falls to NHTSA.402 Instead, \u201c[i]f EPA \nconcludes that California\u2019s standards [meet section \n209(b)], it is obligated to approve California\u2019s waiver \napplication.\u201d403 EPA therefore disagrees with the comment \nthat Massachusetts provides the Agency special duty to \nconsider preemption under EPCA in a joint rulemaking \naction in reviewing waiver requests. In Massachusetts, \nthe Supreme Court recognized the potential overlap \n401.\u2002   Section 209(b)(2) provides that if each State [California] \nstandard is at least as stringent as comparable applicable Federal \nstandards then such standard shall be deemed to be as protective \nof public health and welfare as such federal standards for purposes \nof section 209(b)(1)(A). EPA acknowledges that in 1977 Congress \namended the waiver provision to allow for California to address its \nunique combination of air quality problems and that California only \nbe required to demonstrate stringency in the aggregate and that \ntherefore some pollutant standards may not be as stringent. \n402.\u2002  84 FR at 51338 (\u201cEPA agrees with commenters that EPA \nis not the agency that Congress has tasked with administering \nand interpreting EPCA. This is especially so because \u2018[t]he \nwaiver proceeding produces a forum ill-suited to the resolution of \nconstitutional claims.\u2019 MEMA I, 627 F.2d at 1115.\u201d). \n403.\u2002  MEMA II, 142 F.3d at 463. \n\n250a\nbetween NHTSA\u2019s and EPA\u2019s statutory obligations and \nconcluded that \u201cthere is no reason to think the two \nagencies cannot both administer their obligations yet \navoid inconsistency.\u201d404 As one commenter noted, EPA \nand NHTSA have previously engaged in joint actions \nthat addressed fuel economy and GHG emissions. In \nthose actions, NHTSA\u2019s role has been to set national fuel \neconomy standards and EPA\u2019s role has been to set national \nGHG standards.405 These roles are complementary, but \ndistinct. The Court acknowledged the independence of \nthese roles in Massachusetts: \u201cEPA has been charged with \nprotecting the public\u2019s \u2018health\u2019 and \u2018welfare,\u2019 42 U.S.C. \n7521(a)(1), a statutory obligation wholly independent of \nDOT\u2019s mandate to promote energy efficiency. See Energy \nPolicy and Conservation Act, \u00a72(5), 89 Stat. 874, 42 U.S.C. \n6201(5).\u201d406 \nRegarding the Agency\u2019s simultaneous pronouncement \nthat reliance on preemption under EPCA would be a \nsingular exercise that would not be repeated, statutory \nsupport or past precedent for this singular consideration \nwas also lacking.407 In fact, this singular exercise would \n404.\u2002  Massachusetts v.

Again, the result of this unique \napplication of EPA\u2019s authority is unsupported under \nsection 209(b)(1). \nAs previously noted, EPCA is generally administered \nby NHTSA and consideration of preemption under EPCA \nin reviewing waiver requests would for instance call for \nEPA to resolve the much debated and differing views as \nto what is a \u201claw or regulation related to fuel economy,\u201d \nas contemplated by 39 U.S.C. 32919(a).408 Relevant judicial \nprecedent would also appear to call into question whether \nCalifornia\u2019s GHG standards and ZEV sales mandates \nare indeed preempted under EPCA.409 But as previously \nexplained, EPA does not implement EPCA, and the \nAgency\u2019s review of waiver requests is highly deferential. \nEPA also disagrees with comments that the Agency \nmust generally consider factors outside the criteria listed \nin section 209(b), including preemption under EPCA, \nregardless of the joint- or single-agency nature of the \naction. EPA has never claimed that it has such broad \nauthority to consider factors outside section 209(b) and the \n408.\u2002  EPA takes no position on any role NHTSA might play \nunder 42 U.S.C. 32919(a) and acknowledges that NHTSA discusses \nthis in its recent final rulemaking. See generally 86 FR 74236. \n409.\u2002  See, e.g., Cent. Valley Chrysler-Jeep, Inc. v. Goldstene, \n529 F. Supp. 2d 1151, 1153-54 (E.D. Cal. 2007), as corrected Mar. 26, \n2008; Green Mountain Chrysler Plymouth Dodge Jeep v. Crombie, \n508 F. Supp. 2d 295, 300-01 (D. Vt. 2007). \n\n252a\ndecades of waiver practice, as well as judicial precedent, \nare indicative of the Agency\u2019s narrow scope of review \nfor California waiver requests: \u201c[T]he Administrator \nhas consistently held since first vested with the waiver \nauthority, [that] his inquiry under section 209 is modest \nin scope. He has no \u2018broad and impressive\u2019 authority \nto modify California regulations.\u201d410 Instead, EPA has \nconsistently declined to consider factors outside the \nthree statutory criteria listed in section 209(b).411 This \nlimited scope of review has been repeatedly upheld by \nthe courts. For example, in MEMA I, the D.C. Circuit \nstated that \u201cthere is no such thing as a \u201cgeneral duty\u201d \non an administrative agency to make decisions based on \nfactors other than those Congress expressly or impliedly \nintended the agency to consider.\u201d412 In MEMA II, the D.C. \nCircuit again rejected consideration of a factor outside the \n209(b) statutory criteria because doing so would restrict \nCalifornia\u2019s ability to \u201cexercise broad discretion.\u201d413 \n410.\u2002  MEMA I, 627 F.2d 1095, 1119 (D.C. Cir. 1979). \n411.\u2002  See, e.g., 43 FR at 32184 (rejecting objections to the \nprocedures at state level, objections that section 207(c)(3)(A) \nestablishes field protection, and constitutional objections all as \nbeyond the \u201cnarrow\u201d scope of the Administrator\u2019s review); 74 FR at \n32783 (declining to consider EPCA preemption, stating that \u201csection \n209(b) of the Clean Air Act limits our authority to deny California\u2019s \nrequests for waivers to the three criteria therein.\u201d); 79 FR at 46264 \n(reiterating that EPA can only deny a waiver request based on \nthe 209(b) statutory criteria, dismissing comments on preemption \nunder EPCA, as well as the Constitution and the implications of the \nFAAAA). \n412.\u2002  627 F.2d at 1116. \n413.\u2002  142 F.3d at 464. \n\n253a\nCommenters also claim that ignoring NHTSA\u2019s \nfinding of preemption would violate the Supremacy Clause \nof the Constitution because the necessary consequence of \nNHTSA\u2019s conclusion in SAFE 1 is that certain standards \nwere void ab initio as preempted under EPCA and as such \nthat \u201cthe state mandates referenced in [California\u2019s] petition \nfor reconsideration are not even eligible to be considered \nfor a CAA waiver of preemption.\u201d414 EPA disagrees. As \nthe D.C. Circuit has held, \u201c[t]hat [the Administrator] like \nevery other administrative officer owes allegiance to the \nConstitution does not mean that he is required to issue \nrulings of constitutional dimension.\u201d415 Thus, \u201c[n]othing in \nsection 209 requires [the Administrator] to consider the \nconstitutional ramifications of the regulations for which \nCalifornia requests a waiver.\u201d416 \nMoreover, consideration of factors beyond those set \nout in section 209(b)(1) would subject California and vehicle \nand engine manufacturers to changes in regulatory \nschemes by other federal agencies not acting under the \nauthority of the CAA.417 SAFE 1 and subsequent events \n414.\u2002  NADA at 3. \n415.\u2002  MEMA I, 627 F.2d at 1114-15. \n416.\u2002  Id. at 1115. \n417.\u2002  \u201cThe manufacture of automobiles is a complex matter, \nrequiring decisions to be made far in advance of their actual \nexecution.

Rep. No. 403, 90th Cong., \nat 730 1st Sess. (1967). \n\n254a\nperfectly encapsulate this problem. For instance, NHTSA \nhas since finalized the repeal of the regulatory provisions \nand pronouncements it made in SAFE 1 that were the \nunderpinnings for EPA withdrawing certain aspects of the \nACC program waiver and with that action the Agency\u2019s \nbasis for revocation of the waiver under EPCA has now \nevanesced.418 Additionally, this is affirmation of EPA\u2019s long \nheld view that waiver proceedings are not the appropriate \nvenue for resolving these issues, and the joint-rulemaking \ncontext is not and should never have been justification \nfor deviating from statutory authority and the Agency\u2019s \nhistorical practice. \nIt also bears note that consideration of factors beyond \nthe criteria contained in section 209(b) would not be limited \nto preemption under EPCA. Commenters suggested, \nfor instance, that EPA would not be able to \u201cignore the \nFirst Amendment,\u201d in the hypothetical situation where \nCalifornia impos[ed] standards on some manufacturers \nin retaliation for their voiced opposition to California\u2019s \nauthority as well as criminality such as \u201cbribery and \nextortion had been instrumental in assembling the \nlegislative majorities.\u201d419 In short, under the commenter\u2019s \nview, factors for consideration in waiver proceedings would \nbe innumerable. And yet these factors bear little or no \nrelation to specific criteria in section 209(b) that would \notherwise warrant the denial of a waiver request. The D.C. \nCircuit has already, several times, held that EPA is not \nrequired to consider factors outside of and unconnected \n418.\u2002  See 86 FR 74236. \n419.\u2002  CEI at 11. \n\n255a\nto these statutory criteria, especially constitutional \nobjections. In fact, regarding the commenter\u2019s example, \nthe court has already specifically rejected consideration of \nthe First Amendment in waiver evaluations. In MEMA I, \nthe court considered and upheld EPA\u2019s decision declining \nto consider a First Amendment objection to a waiver as \nbeyond the scope of agency review.420 Courts have also \nrejected objections based on the applicability of CAA \nsection 207 to California waiver requests421 and the \nCommerce Clause.422 EPA is therefore not persuaded \nby these arguments. Additionally, courts have long held \nthat administrative proceedings for California waiver \nrequests are ill-suited for consideration of constitutional \nissues. Nothing precludes commenters from challenging \nCalifornia\u2019s standards themselves\u2014whether under EPCA, \nanother statute, or the Constitution\u2014in other, better-\nsuited fora. According to the D.C. Circuit, for instance, \n[w]hile nothing in section 209 categorically forbids the \nAdministrator from listening to constitutionality-based \nchallenges, petitioners are assured through a petition of \nreview . . . that their contentions will get a hearing.\u201d423 The \nD.C. Circuit has also repeatedly stated that challenges \n420.\u2002  MEMA I, 627 F.2d 1095, 1115 (D.C. Cir. 1979). \n421.\u2002  MEMA II, 142 F.3d 449, 467 (D.C. Cir. 1998). \n422.\u2002  ATA v.

Cir. 2015) (rejecting a challenge for lack of jurisdiction \nbecause challengers objected to California\u2019s regulations themselves, \nnot EPA\u2019s approval of them in a waiver under 209(b)). \n423.\u2002  MEMA I, 627 F.2d at 1115. \n\n256a\nwhich go to the legality of California\u2019s standards \nthemselves, are better addressed directly by either \ncourts or Congress.424 Challenges based on preemption \nunder EPCA similarly go to the legality of California\u2019s \nstandards themselves and are thus more appropriate in \ncourt or addressed to Congress. \nE.\t Conclusion\nBecause the landscape of federal law has changed \nsince SAFE 1 due to NHTSA\u2019s repeal of its regulatory \ntext, appendix, and pronouncements regarding EPCA \npreemption in SAFE 1, EPA believes that it is appropriate \nto rescind its waiver withdrawal actions in SAFE 1 that \nwere predicated on the federal law context created by \nNHTSA\u2019s SAFE 1 action. On separate grounds, EPA also \nbelieves that, based on the foregoing, EPA should not have \ndeviated from its practice of limiting its waiver review \nto the criteria in section 209(b)(1). Thus, for the reasons \nstated above, EPA is rescinding those portions of SAFE \n1 that withdrew the waiver of the ACC program on the \nbasis of preemption under EPCA. \n424.\u2002  Id. at 1105. In ATA v. EPA, the D.C. Circuit rejected \na constitutional challenge to a California waiver, concluding that \nCongress made the decision to give California \u201cthe primary role \nin regulating certain mobile pollution sources\u201d so the challenger\u2019s \nargument was best directed to Congress. 600 F.3d 624, 628 (D.C. \nCir. 2010). \n\n257a\nVII.\tEPA Inappropriately Set Forth an Interpretive \nView of Section 177 in SAFE 1\nIn SAFE 1, EPA provided an interpretive view of \nsection 177 of the CAA, stating that states adopting \nCalifornia\u2019s new motor vehicle emission standards \n(section 177 states) could not adopt California\u2019s GHG \nstandards.425 In this action, EPA determines that it was \nboth inappropriate and unnecessary within a waiver \nproceeding to provide an interpretive view of the authority \nof section 177 states to adopt California standards, as EPA \nplays no statutory approval role in connection with states\u2019 \nadoption of standards identical to those standards for \nwhich a waiver has been granted to California.426 Rather, \nif a state chooses to submit such standards for inclusion \nin an SIP, EPA\u2019s role with regard to approval of these \nstandards is to review them in the same way that EPA \nreviews all SIP revisions a state submits, via a notice and \ncomment process, to ensure that the submission meets \nall statutory and regulatory requirements as part of \nthe Agency\u2019s decision whether to approve or disapprove \nthe submission. Therefore, the Agency is rescinding the \ninterpretive views on section 177 set out in SAFE 1. \n425.\u2002  84 FR at 51310, 51350. \n426.\u2002  EPA is aware of instances of States adopting California \nnew motor vehicle emission standards and not subsequently including \nsuch standards in their SIP. In these circumstances EPA has not \nplayed and would not play an approval role. \n\n258a\nA.\t SAFE 1 Interpretation\nIn the SAFE proposal, EPA proposed to conclude that \n\u201cStates may not adopt California\u2019s GHG standards pursuant \nto section 177 because the text, context, and purpose of \nsection 177 support the conclusion that this provision \nis limited to providing States the ability, under certain \ncircumstances and with certain conditions, to adopt and \nenforce standards designed to control criteria pollutants \nto address NAAQS nonattainment.\u201d427 Additionally, the \nproposal noted the title of section 177 (\u201cNew motor vehicle \nemission standards in nonattainment areas\u201d) indicates a \nlimited scope of application.428 The proposal also suggested \nthat, because \u201c[a]reas are only designated nonattainment \nwith respect to criteria pollutants,\u201d it would be \u201cillogical\u201d \nif states could use their 177 authority \u201cto adopt California \nstandards that addressed environmental problems other \nthan nonattainment of criteria pollutant standards.\u201d429 \nIn the SAFE 1 decision, EPA finalized its proposed \ninterpretive view, reiterating that \u201cthe text (including \nboth the title and main text), structural location, and \npurpose of the provision confirm that it does not apply to \nGHG standards.\u201d430 Because section 177\u2019s title references \nnonattainment areas, and because nonattainment \ndesignations only exist for criteria pollutants, EPA \n427.\u2002  83 FR at 43240. \n428.\u2002  Id. \n429.\u2002  Id. \n430.\u2002  84 FR at 51350. \n\n259a\nclaimed, states could not adopt standards for purposes \nof GHG control under section 177.431 \nAs evidence for this interpretive view, EPA again \npointed to the text and location of the section, which \nhad been the basis for the Agency\u2019s interpretation in the \nSAFE proposal. EPA acknowledged commenters who \nargued that \u201cCAA section 177 does not contain any text \nthat could be read as limiting its applicability to certain \npollutants only\u201d and that EPA had \u201cinappropriately relied \non the heading for CAA section 177 to construe a statutory \nprovision as well as arrogated authority to implement an \notherwise self-implementing provision,\u201d but disagreed \nwith these commenters.432 In addition to the evidence \nrelied on in the proposal, EPA provided examples of \nlegislative history from the 1977 amendments to support \nits interpretive view.433 \n431.\u2002  Id. \n432.\u2002  Id. \n433.\u2002  In particular, EPA cited legislative history on section \n172(b), which set forth the \u201crequisite provisions\u201d for state plans for \nnonattainment areas. Id. at 51350 n.286. According to the legislative \nhistory, one of the many factors that must be considered by a state \nplan is \u201cactual emissions of such pollutant resulting from in-use motor \nvehicles.\u201d Id.

Supporters of SAFE 1 reiterated the reasoning \nfrom the proposal and final action.440 For example, one \ncommenter wrote, \u201cIn short, \u2018the text, context, and \npurpose of Section 177 suggest\u2019 that the provision is \nlimited to motor vehicle standards \u2018designed to control \ncriteria pollutants to address NAAQS nonattainment.\u2019\u201d441 \nLike the SAFE proposal and final action, the commenter \nstated that in addition to the text and context of the \n437.\u2002  See States and Cities\u2019 Petition at 27. \n438.\u2002  Id.

In these circumstances EPA has not \nplayed and would not play an approval role. \n451.\u2002  EPA notes that although section 177 states that \u201c. . . any \nState which has plan provisions approved under this part may adopt \nand enforce for any model year standards relating to control of \nemissions from new motor vehicles . . .\u201d the language in section 177 \ndoes not require a state to submit its adopted motor vehicle emissions \nstandards for SIP approval. \n\n266a\n177 in the context of that action. EPA believes it acted \ninappropriately in providing an interpretive view in \nSAFE 1 and that such action was based on an inaccurate \nassessment of the factual record. EPA\u2019s interpretive view \nwas not compelled by any petition, request, or legislative \nor judicial mandate and was otherwise not final agency \naction.452 EPA is therefore rescinding the interpretive \nviews contained in SAFE 1. \nAs commenters have noted, section 177 does not \ndescribe a direct approval role for EPA. Section 177 says \nthat \u201cany State which has plan provisions approved under \nthis part may adopt and enforce\u201d identical California \nstandards and delineates three specific criteria for \nadoption.453 Nothing in this language or in the text of the \nrest of the section requires or allows EPA to approve such \nadoption and enforcement or directs EPA to implement \nthe section through regulation; EPA plays no statutory \napproval role in the adoption of California standards by \nother states other than action on a SIP revision, should \nthose states include the standards in their plans. In \nfact, there are only three prerequisites to adoption and \nenforcement by a state: That the state has a federally \napproved SIP, that the standards are identical (thus the \n452.\u2002  84 FR at 51338 n.256 (\u201cEPA acknowledges that its \nactions in this document may have implications for certain prior and \npotential future EPA reviews of and actions on state SIPs. . . .

EPA, 606 F.2d \n1293, 1298 (D.C. Cir. 1979). Similarly, in 1994, while enacting rules \nimplementing section 209(e)(2)(B), the parallel provision for the \nnonroad vehicle section of the California Waiver program, EPA \nnoted that section 177 states had not \u201cask[ed] for EPA authorization \nbefore they adopted the California standards, nor did EPA or the \nautomobile industry suggest that they needed such authorization.\u201d \n56 FR 36969, 36983 (1994). See also 77 FR 62637 n.54 (\u201cStates are \nnot required to seek EPA approval under the terms of section 177.\u201d). \n456.\u2002  EPA also notes that there are ample judicial avenues \nto directly challenge state adoption of California standards. For \nexample, the First and Second Circuits have already addressed \nobjections to the adoption of California standards under section 177. \nIn both Am. Auto. Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. Mass. DEP and Motor Vehicle Mfrs. \nAss\u2019n v. NYSDEC, petitioners argued that the States\u2019 adoption of \nCalifornia\u2019s low emission vehicles standards without the associated \nclean fuels plan violated section 177. 31 F.3d 18 (1st Cir. 1994); 17 \nF.3d 521 (2d Cir. 1994). \n\n268a\nSIP revision that includes that adopted standard. In that \nproceeding, EPA could determine whether the statutory \ncriteria for adoption are met for purposes of approving a \nSIP revision.

Therefore, EPA \nwithdraws its interpretive views that had been set forth \nin SAFE 1.\nVIII.\t Other Issues\nA.\t Equal Sovereignty\nAs explained in Section VI, EPA must grant \nCalifornia\u2019s waiver request unless the Agency makes \none of the specified findings in section 209(b)(1). In this \n459.\u2002  The Agency has considered whether there may be any \nreliance interests on EPA\u2019s previous interpretive view of section \n177 described in the SAFE 1 action. EPA is unaware of any such \ninterests, and none were raised in comments. \n460.\u2002  To the extent that EPA\u2019s reasoning in its SAFE 1 section \n177 determination lacked fair notice, as the States and Cities\u2019 Petition \nclaimed, such a contention is rendered moot by this action. \n\n270a\ninstance, Congress has made multiple determinations \nthrough its adoption of section 209 and subsequent \namendments, dating from 1967 through the 1990 CAA \nAmendments, regarding California\u2019s role and its relation \nto federal standard setting for mobile sources. EPA\u2019s \nlongstanding waiver practice, consistent with case law, \nhas been to refrain from considering factors beyond \nsection 209(b)(1) criteria as well as constitutional claims \nin the review of California waiver requests.461 EPA \nacknowledges that California adopts its standards \nas a matter of law under its police powers,462 that the \nAgency\u2019s task in reviewing waiver requests is properly \nlimited to evaluating California\u2019s request according to \n461.\u2002  EPA has declined to consider constitutional challenges to \nCalifornia Waivers since at least 1976. 41 FR 44212 (Oct. 7, 1976) (\u201cAn \nadditional argument against granting the waiver was raised by the \nMotorcycle Industry Council and Yamaha, who contended that the \nCARB had violated due process when adopting their standards, by \nnot allowing the manufacturers a fair and full opportunity to present \ntheir views at a State hearing. If this argument has any validity, \nthe EPA waiver hearing is not the proper forum in which to raise it. \nSection 209(b) does not require that EPA insist on any particular \nprocedures at the State level. Furthermore, a complete opportunity \nwas provided at the EPA waiver hearing for the presentation of \nviews.\u201d). See also, e.g., 43 FR at 32184 (July 25, 1978) (rejecting \nobjections to the procedures at state level, objections that section \n207(c)(3)(A) establishes field protection, and constitutional objections \nall as beyond the \u201cnarrow\u201d scope of the Administrator\u2019s review). \n462.\u2002  Central Valley Chrysler-Jeep, Inc. v. Goldstene, 529 \nF.Supp.2d 1151, 1174 (\u201cThe waiver provision of the Clean Air Act \nrecognizes that California has exercised its police power to regulate \npollution emissions from motor vehicles since before March 30, 1966; \na date that predates both the Clean Air Act and EPCA.\u201d). \n\n271a\nthe criteria in section 209(b), and that it is appropriate \nto defer to litigation brought by third parties in other \ncourts, such as state or federal court, for the resolution \nof constitutionality claims and inconsistency, if any, with \nother statutes. As further explained this practice flows \nfrom the statute and legislative history, which reflect a \nbroad policy deference that is afforded to California to \naddress its serious air quality problems (which are on-\ngoing) as well as to drive emission control innovation. And \nso, EPA has historically declined to consider constitutional \nissues in evaluating and granting section 209 waivers. In \nMEMA I, the D.C. Circuit rejected a First Amendment \nchallenge to a waiver as outside the scope of review.463 In \n2009, EPA approved a waiver (and authorization) under \nsection 209(e), granting California authority to enforce \nits Airborne Toxic Control Measure, which established \nin-use emission performance standards for engines in \ntransport refrigeration units (TRUs) and TRU generator \nsets.464 Responding to comments that the waiver reached \nbeyond California\u2019s borders in violation of the Dormant \nCommerce Clause, EPA stated that such considerations \nare not factors that EPA must consider under section \n209(e) because \u201cEPA\u2019s review of California\u2019s regulations \nis limited to the criteria that Congress directed EPA to \nreview.\u201d465 This interpretation was upheld by the D.C. \nCircuit Court of Appeals.

First, Clean Air Act Section 209(b) places no \nextraordinary burden or disadvantage on one or more States. Rather, \nthe statute benefits California by allowing the exercise of its police \npower authority to address its particular pollution control needs. \nSecond, the foundation for reserving California\u2019s authority has not \nwaned over time.

As \nsuch, commenters maintain that EPA lacks a necessary \npredicate to permit California\u2019s enforcement of its \namended GHG standards. \nOther commenters argued that the \u201cdeemed to comply\u201d \nprovision was always conditioned on the federal standards \n475.\u2002  AFPM at 7; Urban Air at 2, 18-19; NADA at 6. \n\n277a\nproviding GHG reductions that were at least equal to or \nas protective as California\u2019s program and so the 2018 \namendments did not substantively change the provision \nor affect any related reliance interests and instead were \ndesigned to clarify the provision.476 Commenters maintain \nthat CARB adopted \u201cnon-substantive amendments for its \nLEV III regulations to further clarify that the deemed-\nto-comply provision would only apply if the federal GHG \nstandards remained substantially as they were as of the \ndate of the 2017 Final Determination.\u201d477 According to \nthese commenters, California adopted these amendments \nafter EPA\u2019s withdrawal of its 2017 Final Determination \nthat had determined that its Federal GHG standards for \nmodel years 2022-2025 remained appropriate and instead \nconcluded that the federal standards for model years \n2022-2025 may be too stringent and should be revised. \nEPA notes that after the January 2017 MTE CARB \nsubsequently found that compliance with those federal \nstandards would result in equivalent or greater GHG \nbenefits than originally projected for California.478 These \ncommenters further maintain that the clarification of the \n476.\u2002  States and Cities at 58-61. (\u201cCalifornia always intended \nits standards would \u2018remain an important backstop in the event the \nnational program is weakened or terminated.\u2019 78 FR at 2,128.\u201d). \n477.\u2002  Id. at 60. \u201cFinal Determination on the Appropriateness \nof the Model Year 2022-2025 Light-Duty Vehicle Greenhouse \nGas Emissions Standards under the Midterm Evaluation\u201d (2017 \nFinal Determination) at https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPDF.\ncgi?Dockey=P100QQ91.pdf. \n478.\u2002  82 FR 14671 (March 22, 2017) and 83 FR 16077 (April \n13, 2018). \n\n278a\ndeemed-to-comply provision is immaterial to the reversal \nof the waiver withdrawal in SAFE 1 because the SAFE \n1 action was expressly based on EPA\u2019s decision to rely on \nNHTSA\u2019s preemption findings and section 209(b)(1)(B) \ndetermination, neither of which was based on CARB\u2019s \n2018 clarification rulemaking. As such, the commenters \nmaintain that the clarification of the deemed-to-comply \nprovision has no bearing on and does not preclude EPA\u2019s \nSAFE 1 waiver withdrawal.479 \nAs previously explained, under section 209(b)(1) EPA \nis to grant a waiver of preemption for California to enforce \nits own standards that would otherwise be preempted \nunder section 209(a). This preemption does not extend to \nfederal standards that are adopted under section 202(a). \nEPA explained this in responding to comments on the \ndeemed-to-comply provision in the ACC program waiver \ndecision. \u201c[T]he waiver decision affects only California\u2019s \nemission standards, not the federal standards that exist \nregardless of EPA\u2019s decision.\u201d480 This preemptive effect \nof section 209(a) does not change even when California \nchooses to allow for compliance with its standards through \nfederal standards as envisaged by the deemed-to-comply \nprovision. \nIt also bears note that in SAFE 1, EPA made clear \nthat the 2018 amendment was not a \u201cnecessary part of \nthe basis for the waiver withdrawal and other actions that \n479.\u2002  States and Cities at 60-62. \n480.\u2002  78 FR at 2124. \n\n279a\nEPA finalizes in this [SAFE1] document.481 In the Notice of \nReconsideration, EPA neither reopened nor reconsidered \nelements of the 2013 waiver that were not part of EPA\u2019s \nfindings in SAFE 1.482 As noted in this decision, EPA \nhas evaluated the factual and legal errors that occurred \nin SAFE 1. As part of this evaluation, EPA believes it \nhas considered all appropriate and relevant information \nnecessary to its review of issues associated with the \nsecond waiver prong or consideration of preemption \nunder EPCA. The Agency also recognizes that it received \ncomments from parties that raised non-germane issues to \nEPA\u2019s Notice of Reconsideration. EPA did not conduct an \nanalysis of such comments in the context of reconsidering \nthe specific actions taken in SAFE 1. EPA also makes \nclear that the result of rescinding its part of SAFE 1 is \n481.\u2002  EPA declined to \u201ctake any position at this point on what \neffect California\u2019s December 2018 amendment to its \u201cdeemed to \ncomply\u2019 provision . . . [may] have on the continued validity of the \nJanuary 2013 waiver.\u201d 84 FR at 51329, n.208, 51334, n.230. Although \nEPA claimed in SAFE 1 that the deemed to comply clarification \nconfirmed and provided further support for the SAFE 1 action, \nEPA no longer makes this claim to the extent it is relevant in its \nreconsideration and rescission of SAFE 1. The consequence of this \naction is the reinstatement of the ACC program waiver issued in 2013 \nand does not extend to other regulatory developments in California \nor by EPA that occurred subsequent to that waiver decision. \n482.\u2002  86 FR at 22423. In addition to declining to take a position \non the effect of California\u2019s 2018 amendments to its \u201cdeemed to \ncomply\u201d provision, SAFE 1 did not finalize the withdrawal of the \nwaiver under the first or third waiver prongs. EPA also notes that \nit has previously responded twice to the comments suggesting that \nCARB\u2019s deemed-to-comply provision demonstrates that California \ndoes not have a need for its own standards. See 78 FR at 2124-25. \n\n280a\nthe automatic reinstatement of the waiver granted to \nCalifornia in 2013 for its ACC program. That is the result \nof the action taken herein.483\nIX.\tDecision\nAfter review of the information submitted by CARB \nand other public commenters, the SAFE 1 action, and the \nrecord pertaining to EPA\u2019s 2013 ACC program waiver, I \nfind that EPA did not appropriately exercise its limited \ninherent authority to reconsider waiver grants in SAFE \n1. SAFE 1 did not correct a clerical or factual error, nor \ndid the factual circumstances and conditions related to the \nthree statutory criteria change prior to SAFE 1, much \nless change so significantly as to cast the propriety of the \nwaiver grant into doubt. On this basis, I am rescinding \nthe SAFE 1 action.\n483.\u2002  EPA acknowledges that motor vehicle emission standards \nin California as well as federally are periodically clarified, amended, \nor revised. For example, after California issued its first deemed-to-\ncomply regulation, EPA determined that the state\u2019s GHG standards \nwere within the scope of the 2009 waiver. While EPA believes that \nCongress intended regulatory certainty to be attached to the \nAgency\u2019s waivers issued under section 209, EPA acknowledges that \nconditions may change over time so significantly that it could merit a \nreview of California\u2019s motor vehicle emission program and applicable \nstandards therein or that would prompt California to submit a \nrelated waiver request to EPA. As explained in this decision, the \nconditions associated with the analysis of the three waiver criteria \nperformed in the ACC waiver decision did not change so as to merit \nthe SAFE 1 action. EPA recognizes that federal light-duty vehicle \nGHG emission standards have been modified twice since SAFE 1 \nwas issued; the current standards do not change EPA\u2019s conclusion \nthat SAFE 1 should be rescinded. \n\n281a\nFurthermore, after review of both the 2013 ACC \nprogram waiver record as well as the SAFE 1 record, \nto the extent that EPA did have authority to reconsider \nthe ACC program waiver, I have determined that the \nasserted bases were in error and did not justify the \nwaiver withdrawal. With respect to the Agency\u2019s first \npurported basis\u2014its discretionary decision to undertake \na reinterpretation of the second waiver prong\u2014I find \nthat the statutory interpretation adopted in SAFE 1 \nis a flawed reading of the statute, and I hereby return \nto the traditional interpretation of the second waiver \nprong, which is, at least, the better interpretation. \nUnder the traditional interpretation, which looks at the \nprogram as a whole, California clearly had a compelling \nneed for the ACC program. Even if SAFE 1\u2019s statutory \nreinterpretation, which focuses on California\u2019s compelling \nneed for the specific standards, were an appropriate \nreading, EPA did not perform a reasonable, accurate, \nand complete review of the factual record in its findings \nregarding the criteria emission benefits of CARB\u2019s ZEV \nsales mandate and GHG emission regulations. Upon \nreview, I find that SAFE 1\u2019s predicate for concluding \nthat California did not have a compelling need for these \nspecific standards was not reasonable given the record \nat the time of the ACC program waiver and once again \nduring the SAFE 1 proceeding. A reasonable, accurate, \nand complete review of the record supports the need for \nCalifornia\u2019s specific GHG emission standards and ZEV \nsales mandate to meet compelling and extraordinary \nconditions in California. This is true whether I look at \nhow these standards reduce criteria pollution, GHG \npollution, or both. In sum, although I am not adopting \n\n282a\nthe interpretation of the second waiver prong set forth \nin SAFE 1, I find that the burden of proof necessary to \ndemonstrate that CARB\u2019s ZEV sales mandate and GHG \nemission standards are not needed to meet compelling and \nextraordinary conditions has not been met under either \ninterpretation of the second waiver prong. Therefore, I \nrescind the Agency\u2019s part of the SAFE 1 action to the \nextent it relied upon the second waiver prong to withdraw \nthe ACC program waiver. \nWith regard to the applicability of preemption under \nEPCA, I find that, to the extent EPA\u2019s authority to \nreconsider the ACC program waiver rested upon NHTSA\u2019s \njoint action at the time as well as the applicability of its \nEPCA interpretation to EPA\u2019s review, this statute falls \nclearly outside the confines of section 209(b) where EPA\u2019s \nauthority to grant, deny, and reconsider waivers resides. \nIn any event, the grounds for such action under SAFE \n1 no longer exist given NHTSA\u2019s recent final action \nwithdrawing its EPCA preemption rule in its entirety.\nEach of the decisions and justifications contained in \nthis final action is severable.\nThis decision rescinds EPA\u2019s SAFE 1 action and \ntherefore, as a result, the waiver of preemption EPA \ngranted to California for its ACC program ZEV sales \nmandates and GHG emission standards issued in 2013, \nincluding for the 2017 through 2025 model years, comes \nback into force.\n\n283a\nJudicial Review\nSection 307(b)(1) of the CAA governs judicial review \nof final actions by EPA. This section provides, in part, \nthat petitions for review must be filed in the Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia Circuit: (i) When \nthe agency action consists of \u201cnationally applicable \nregulations promulgated, or final actions taken, by \nthe Administrator,\u201d or (ii) when such action is locally \nor regionally applicable, but \u201csuch action is based on \na determination of nationwide scope or effect and if in \ntaking such action the Administrator finds and publishes \nthat such action is based on such a determination.\u201d For \nlocally or regionally applicable final actions, the CAA \nreserves to EPA complete discretion whether to invoke \nthe exception in (ii).\nThis final action is \u201cnationally applicable\u201d within \nthe meaning of section 307(b)(1). In the alternative, \nto the extent a court finds this action to be locally or \nregionally applicable, the Administrator is exercising \nthe complete discretion afforded to him under the CAA \nto make and publish a finding that this action is based on \na determination of \u201cnationwide scope or effect\u201d within \nthe meaning of section 307(b)(1).484 This action rescinds \nEPA\u2019s final action in SAFE 1, which withdrew a waiver \n484.\u2002  In deciding whether to invoke the exception by making and \npublishing a finding that this final action is based on a determination \nof nationwide scope or effect, the Administrator has also taken into \naccount a number of policy considerations, including his judgment \nbalancing the benefit of obtaining the D.C. Circuit\u2019s authoritative \ncentralized review versus allowing development of the issue in other \ncontexts and the best use of agency resources. \n\n284a\nfor new motor vehicle greenhouse gas emission standards \nand ZEV sales mandate granted to California under \nsection 209(b) of the CAA. In addition to California, \nsixteen other states and the District of Columbia have \nalready adopted California\u2019s motor vehicle greenhouse gas \nstandards. The other states are New York, Massachusetts, \nVermont, Maine, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Rhode \nIsland, Washington, Oregon, Minnesota, New Jersey, \nNevada, Maryland, Virginia, Colorado, and Delaware.485 \nThese jurisdictions represent a wide geographic area \nand fall within eight different judicial circuits.486 In \naddition, this action will affect manufacturers nationwide \nwho produce vehicles to meet the emissions standards \nof these states. For these reasons, this final action is \nnationally applicable or, alternatively, the Administrator is \nexercising the complete discretion afforded to him by the \nCAA and hereby finds that this final action is based on a \ndetermination of nationwide scope or effect for purposes \nof section 307(b)(1) and is hereby publishing that finding \nin the Federal Register . \nUnder CAA section 307(b)(1), petitions for judicial \nreview of this action must be filed in the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit \n485.\u2002  The same states have adopted California\u2019s ZEV sales \nmandate regulation with the exception of Pennsylvania, Washington, \nand Delaware. \n486.\u2002  In the report on the 1977 Amendments that revised \nCAA section 307(b)(1), Congress noted that the Administrator\u2019s \ndetermination that the \u201cnationwide scope or effect\u201d exception applies \nwould be appropriate for any action that has a scope or effect beyond \na single judicial circuit. See H.R. Rep. No. 95-294 at 323-24, reprinted \nin 1977 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1402-03. \n\n285a\nwithin 60 days from the date this final action is published \nin the Federal Register . \nX.\t Statutory and Executive Order Reviews\nAs with past waiver decisions, this action is not a \nrule as defined by Executive Order 12866. Therefore, it \nis exempt from review by the Office of Management and \nBudget as required for rules and regulations by Executive \nOrder 12866.\nIn addition, this action is not a rule as defined in the \nRegulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601(2). Therefore, \nEPA has not prepared a supporting regulatory flexibility \nanalysis addressing the impact of this action on small \nbusiness entities.\nFurther, Subtitle E of the Small Business Regulatory \nEnforcement Fairness Act of 1996, also known as the \nCongressional Review Act, 5 U.S.C. 801, et seq., does not \napply because this action is not a rule for purposes of 5 \nU.S.C. 804(3). \nMichael S.

By filtering for the 'brief of respondent' (the EPA), this action seeks to uncover the primary arguments *against* standing, which is crucial for a balanced analysis and prediction. This will provide a direct counterpoint to the petitioners' claims and significantly clarify the legal battleground for this specific case (high Task EIG). Furthermore, this action exemplifies a sophisticated and generalizable strategy: isolating a key legal doctrine and then specifically searching for how a particular party (the respondent) addresses it. This refines the general approach of searching briefs and provides valuable insight into efficient information gathering for future cases (moderate-to-high Design EIG).",

As their case progresses, they \nmust \u201cpoint to factual evidence\u201d establishing that they \nsatisfied the three elements of standing\u2014injury, cau-\nsation, and redressability\u2014as of the time they filed \nsuit.  Murthy v. Missouri, 603 U.S. 43, 57-58 (2024).  \nThe only question here is how to apply those long-set-\ntled requirements to the peculiar circumstances of this \ncase, involving a waiver of preemption under Section \n209(b) of the Clean Air Act. \nAs petitioners describe things, that question is \n\u201cstraightforward\u201d because standing is automatic here.  \nPet. Br. 35.  Petitioners profit from sales of fuel.  They \nnote that the waiver allowed California to impose \nstate standards limiting greenhouse-gas emissions \nacross automakers\u2019 fleets and requiring automakers to \nsell a certain percentage of zero-emission vehicles.  Pe-\ntitioners assert that \u201c[t]hey promptly challenged \nEPA\u2019s waiver,\u201d id. at 20; that the waiver injures peti-\ntioners and their members by \u201creduc[ing] the use of \nliquid fuel,\u201d id.; and that \u201c[s]etting aside EPA\u2019s waiver \nwould . . . end[] the artificial depression of demand for \npetitioners\u2019 products,\u201d id. at 20-21.  Standing was so \n\u201cobvious,\u201d in their view, that they did not \u201cneed to sup-\nply additional record evidence\u201d to establish redressa-\nbility.  Id. at 17, 18. \nBut \u201capplying the law of standing\u201d frequently de-\nmands a \u201cheavily fact-dependent\u201d inquiry, FDA v. All. \nfor Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 384 (2024), and pe-\ntitioners elide the most salient facts in this case.  EPA \ngranted the relevant waiver in 2013.  Petitioners did \nnot challenge that waiver and neither did anyone else.  \nIt remained in effect for more than six years before \n\n \n2 \n \nEPA withdrew it in 2019.  During those six years, in \nresponse to the state standards and wider national \nand global trends, automakers invested heavily in \nchanging their fleets and building consumer demand \nfor electric vehicles.  Consumer preferences and the \nautomobile market evolved.  Even when EPA with-\ndrew the waiver, automakers accelerated their transi-\ntion to electric vehicles and consumer demand \ncontinued to grow. \nIn 2021, when EPA invited comment on whether to \nreinstate the waiver, the state respondents supported \nreinstatement.  As their comment explained, the with-\ndrawal had exceeded EPA\u2019s authority and it deprived \nCalifornia\u2019s regulations of legal effect.  But by the time \nEPA reinstated the waiver and petitioners challenged \nthat decision in 2022, \u201c\u2018both internal sustainability \ngoals and external market forces\u2019\u201d were pushing \n\u201cmanufacturers to transition toward electric vehicles, \nirrespective of California\u2019s regulations.\u201d  Pet. App. 24a \nn.8.  Indeed, publicly available evidence submitted by \nthe state respondents showed that zero-emission vehi-\ncles sold in California in 2022 already exceeded what \nthe relevant standards required.  Consumers were \nwilling to pay substantial price premiums for those ve-\nhicles.  And automakers had strong incentives to keep \nselling them. \nWhen the court of appeals confronted petitioners\u2019 \nchallenge to the reinstatement, it had to assure itself \nof jurisdiction by evaluating whether vacatur of that \nreinstatement would likely lead automakers to make \nchoices that would redress petitioners\u2019 asserted injury.  \nGiven the circumstances when petitioners filed suit in \nMay 2022, would automakers change their fleets or \nprices in a way that would increase demand for peti-\ntioners\u2019 liquid-fuel products?  Or would automakers \n\n \n3 \n \nexceed the requirements of California\u2019s standards for \ntheir own economic and strategic reasons, even with-\nout a legal requirement to do so?  Petitioners submit-\nted no evidence addressing that critical issue.  And \ngiven that absence of proof, the court of appeals \nproperly held that petitioners failed to meet their bur-\nden of demonstrating redressability. \nPetitioners ask this Court to excuse that failure.  \nThey first urge the Court to adopt a new \u201ccategorical \nrule.\u201d  Pet. Br. 4.  Under that rule, redressability \nwould be established automatically whenever peti-\ntioners challenge a regulation that implicates the use \nof their products\u2014even if the regulation applies only \nto third parties, and even where petitioners introduce \nno evidence indicating that those third parties would \nhave acted differently in the regulation\u2019s absence.  Id.  \nIn the alternative, petitioners ask the Court to credit \ntheir unsubstantiated predictions about how au-\ntomakers might respond to a vacatur.  Id. at 30-35.  \nThose arguments find no support in this Court\u2019s prec-\nedent.  Adopting them would effectively eliminate the \nplaintiff\u2019s \u201cburden of showing that third parties will \nlikely react\u201d to a favorable judgment in a way that pro-\nvides redress.  Dep\u2019t of Com. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, \n768 (2019).  And they would allow a court to assume \nredressability even if all the evidence before it indi-\ncates that a favorable judgment would not, in fact, re-\ndress the plaintiffs\u2019 injury.  This Court should reject \npetitioners\u2019 novel standing theories and affirm the \njudgment below. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal and Regulatory Background \n1.  The Clean Air Act directs EPA to prescribe fed-\neral standards governing emissions of air pollutants \n\n \n4 \n \nfrom new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle en-\ngines.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7521.  Section 209(a) of the Act gen-\nerally preempts States and their political subdivisions \nfrom \u201cadopt[ing] or attempt[ing] to enforce any stand-\nard relating to the control of emissions from new mo-\ntor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines.\u201d  Id. \n\u00a7 7543(a).  But Section 209(b) instructs EPA to \u201cwaive \napplication of [Section 209] to any State which ha[d] \nadopted\u201d qualifying emission standards \u201cprior to \nMarch 30, 1966, if the State determines that the State \nstandards will be, in the aggregate, at least as protec-\ntive of public health and welfare as applicable Federal \nstandards.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7543(b)(1).  If a State makes that de-\ntermination, EPA must waive preemption unless it \nmakes one of three enumerated findings.  See id. \n\u00a7 7543(b)(1)(A)-(C). \nCalifornia is the only State eligible for a waiver un-\nder Section 209(b) because it was the only State that \nhad developed qualifying motor vehicle emissions \nstandards before March 30, 1966.  Pet. App. 7a.  \u201cCon-\ngress recognized that California was already the \n\u2018lead[er] in the establishment of standards for regula-\ntion of automative pollutant emissions\u2019 at a time when \nthe federal government had yet to promulgate any reg-\nulations of its own.\u201d  Engine Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 88 \nF.3d 1075, 1079 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  Congress designed \nSection 209 to allow California to continue to serve as \na \u201c\u2018laboratory for innovation,\u2019\u201d id. at 1080, while also \n\u201cavoid[ing] the economic disruption\u201d that would come \nfrom manufacturers \u201chaving to meet fifty-one separate \nsets of emission control requirements,\u201d Motor & \nEquip. Mfrs. Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. EPA, 627 F.2d 1095, 1109 \n(D.C. Cir. 1979); see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7507 (1977 \namendment allowing other States to adopt standards \n\u201cidentical to the California standards for which a \nwaiver has been granted for such model year\u201d); Pet. \n\n \n5 \n \nApp. 9a n.3 (noting that \u201cseventeen states have chosen \nto adopt some portion of the California regulations\u201d). \nCalifornia received its first waiver in 1968 and has \nreceived additional waivers in every subsequent dec-\nade.1  For instance, EPA granted a waiver in 1993 for \nCalifornia\u2019s first Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) regula-\ntion, which required a specific percentage of light-duty \nvehicles to be zero-emission vehicles with no exhaust \nor evaporative emissions.  58 Fed. Reg. 4166 (Jan. 13, \n1993).2  EPA granted another waiver, in 2009, for Cal-\nifornia\u2019s first set of regulations to control greenhouse-\ngas emissions from motor vehicles.  74 Fed. Reg. \n32,744 (July 8, 2009). \n2.  This litigation concerns a set of emissions \nstandards that California adopted in 2012 as part of \nits Advanced Clean Cars I program.  78 Fed. Reg. 2112 \n(Jan. 9, 2013).  As relevant here, those standards in-\ncluded a requirement that automakers reduce the av-\nerage greenhouse-gas emissions across the fleets of \nvehicles they sell in California.  See id. at 2114.  They \nalso included new ZEV standards, requiring manufac-\nturers to meet specified \u201cZEV credit percentage\u201d re-\nquirements.  Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(b) \n(2012).   \nA manufacturer can satisfy the \u201cZEV credit per-\ncentage\u201d in several ways:  by generating credits from \nsales of qualifying vehicles, purchasing credits from \nother manufacturers, using excess credits banked in \nprior years, or applying credits obtained by overcom-\n \n1 See EPA, Vehicle Emissions California Waivers and Authoriza-\ntions, https://tinyurl.com/3rxscztw (last visited Mar. 6, 2025). \n2  See Cal. Air Res. Bd., Low-Emission Vehicle Program,  \nhttps://tinyurl.com/49m28yze (last visited Mar. 6, 2025). \n\n \n6 \n \nplying with the greenhouse-gas emission require-\nments.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(d)(5); 78 \nFed. Reg. at 2119-2120, 2135.  The number of ZEV \ncredits generated by a vehicle sale depends on the ve-\nhicle\u2019s range when operating on electric power.  See \nCal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(d)(5).  For example, a \nplug-in hybrid vehicle with a \u201c50 mile\u201d electric range \nearns one credit, while a fully battery-electric vehicle \nwith a \u201c350 mile\u201d range earns four credits.3  As a re-\nsult, a fleet may satisfy the standards even though \nZEV sales as a percentage of light-duty vehicles sold \nis well below the applicable ZEV credit percentage re-\nquirement.  \nThe Advanced Clean Cars I standards affected \nmodel years beginning in 2017 (for greenhouse-gas \nemissions) and 2018 (for ZEV requirements).  Both \nsets of standards were originally structured to in-\ncrease in stringency through model year 2025 and re-\nmain in effect at 2025 levels for subsequent model \nyears.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1961.3(a)(1)(A) \n(2012); id. \u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2012); J.A. 50.  In 2022, \nhowever, California amended the ZEV standards (but \nnot the greenhouse-gas standards) to expire after \nmodel year 2025.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \n\u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2022).4 \n \n3 78 Fed. Reg. at 2114-2115; see Cal. Air Res. Bd., ACC II ZEV \nTechnology Assessment, at 11-12 tbl. 2 (Apr. 12, 2022) (showing \nelectric ranges of model year 2021 battery and plug-in hybrid ve-\nhicles), https://tinyurl.com/2d2db9vc (last visited Mar. 11, 2025).  \n4  California adopted that amendment because its Advanced \nClean Cars II standards included a new set of ZEV requirements \napplicable to model years 2026 and beyond.  See Cal. Code Regs. \ntit. 13, \u00a7 1962.4(a) (2022).  EPA granted a waiver for the Ad-\nvanced Clean Cars II standards on December 17, 2024.  90 Fed. \n(continued\u2026) \n\n \n7 \n \nCalifornia requested a waiver for the Advanced \nClean Cars I program in 2012.  That request described \nhow the new standards would increase production of \nzero-emission vehicles, thus decreasing emissions of \ncriteria pollutants and greenhouse gases.  J.A. 34-35, \n40-44.  EPA granted the waiver in early 2013.  78 Fed. \nReg. at 2145.  As the Federal Register notice of that \naction observed, petitions for judicial review were due \nby March 11, 2013.  Id.; see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1).  No-\nbody challenged EPA\u2019s decision to grant the waiver. \nMore than six years later, EPA withdrew the parts \nof the waiver at issue in this case.  84 Fed. Reg. 51,310 \n(Sept. 27, 2019).  By that time, automakers had made \n\u201cinvestments to meet\u201d the greenhouse-gas and ZEV \nstandards and \u201chad adjusted their fleets to comply \nwith\u201d them.  Pet. App. 12a; see id. at 124a.  Consumers \nhad grown increasingly familiar with zero-emission \nvehicles.  Even after the waiver was withdrawn, con-\nsumer demand for those vehicles continued to grow \nand automakers continued to announce plans to sell \nthem in greater numbers.  J.A. 191-192, 201-203.  By \n2020, for example, zero-emission vehicles were around \n8% of the new light-duty vehicles registered in Califor-\nnia; that figure jumped to over 12% the following \nyear.5 \nIn 2021, EPA solicited comment on whether it \nshould reinstate the waiver.  The state respondents \nsubmitted a comment in July 2021, explaining that \n \nReg. 642 (2025).  Several challenges to that waiver are now pend-\ning, including one that two of the petitioners here filed on Febru-\nary 28, 2025.  Pet. for Rev., Valero Renewable Fuels Co., LLC v. \nEPA, No. 25-1078 (D.C. Cir.).   \n5 Cal. Energy Comm\u2019n, New ZEV Sales in California, https://ti-\nnyurl.com/pt526fp5 (displaying \u201cZEV Sales Share\u201d in top-right \ncorner when 2020 and 2021 filters are selected). \n\n \n8 \n \nthe withdrawal was unlawful and poorly reasoned.  \nC.A. J.A. 188-215; see J.A. 51-68.  Auto-industry com-\nmenters emphasized the \u201cbillions of dollars of invest-\nment \nin \nelectric \nvehicle \nmanufacturing \nand \ninfrastructure\u201d that automakers had already made as \na result of the 2013 decision to grant the waiver.  J.A. \n103 (National Coalition for Advanced Transportation \ncomment); cf. J.A. 63 (California comment observing \nthat \u201cautomakers have complied with, and often over-\ncomplied with, model years 2017-2020 already\u201d).  EPA \nreinstated the waiver in March 2022.  87 Fed. Reg. \n14,332 (Mar. 14, 2022). \nB. Procedural Background \n1.  The petitioners here are various companies that \nproduce or sell liquid fuels, as well as related trade as-\nsociations.  Pet. App. 2a.  They filed petitions for re-\nview of EPA\u2019s reinstatement decision in the D.C. \nCircuit on May 12, 2022.  Id. at 15a.  The court of ap-\npeals consolidated those cases, along with another \ncase initiated by a group of States led by Ohio.  Id.  \nShortly thereafter, the state respondents here filed an \nunopposed motion for leave to intervene in support of \nEPA, as did various automakers and public-interest \norganizations.  Id. at 15a & nn.4-6; see J.A. 107.  Those \nmotions were granted.  See Pet. App. 15a. \nPetitioners principally argued that EPA\u2019s rein-\nstatement of the waiver contravened the Clean Air \nAct.  Pet. App. 16a.  Before the court of appeals could \nreach the merits of that claim, however, it had to as-\nsure itself of jurisdiction.  Under longstanding circuit \nrules, the opening brief for a petitioner seeking review \nof agency action \u201cmust set forth the basis for the claim \nof standing.\u201d  D.C. Cir. R. 28(a)(7).  And if \u201cstanding is \nnot apparent from the administrative record, the brief \nmust include arguments and evidence establishing the \n\n \n9 \n \nclaim of standing.\u201d  Id.; see also Sierra Club v. EPA, \n292 F.3d 895, 901 (D.C. Cir. 2002). \nPetitioners\u2019 opening brief below devoted just two \nparagraphs to standing.  J.A. 118-119.  Petitioners ex-\nplained that \u201cdepressing the demand\u201d for liquid fuels \n\u201cinjures petitioners and petitioners\u2019 members finan-\ncially.\u201d  Id. at 118.

As their case progresses, they \nmust \u201cpoint to factual evidence\u201d establishing that they \nsatisfied the three elements of standing\u2014injury, cau-\nsation, and redressability\u2014as of the time they filed \nsuit.  Murthy v. Missouri, 603 U.S. 43, 57-58 (2024).  \nThe only question here is how to apply those long-set-\ntled requirements to the peculiar circumstances of this \ncase, involving a waiver of preemption under Section \n209(b) of the Clean Air Act. \nAs petitioners describe things, that question is \n\u201cstraightforward\u201d because standing is automatic here.  \nPet. Br. 35.  Petitioners profit from sales of fuel.  They \nnote that the waiver allowed California to impose \nstate standards limiting greenhouse-gas emissions \nacross automakers\u2019 fleets and requiring automakers to \nsell a certain percentage of zero-emission vehicles.  Pe-\ntitioners assert that \u201c[t]hey promptly challenged \nEPA\u2019s waiver,\u201d id. at 20; that the waiver injures peti-\ntioners and their members by \u201creduc[ing] the use of \nliquid fuel,\u201d id.; and that \u201c[s]etting aside EPA\u2019s waiver \nwould . . . end[] the artificial depression of demand for \npetitioners\u2019 products,\u201d id. at 20-21.  Standing was so \n\u201cobvious,\u201d in their view, that they did not \u201cneed to sup-\nply additional record evidence\u201d to establish redressa-\nbility.  Id. at 17, 18. \nBut \u201capplying the law of standing\u201d frequently de-\nmands a \u201cheavily fact-dependent\u201d inquiry, FDA v. All. \nfor Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 384 (2024), and pe-\ntitioners elide the most salient facts in this case.  EPA \ngranted the relevant waiver in 2013.  Petitioners did \nnot challenge that waiver and neither did anyone else.  \nIt remained in effect for more than six years before \n\n \n2 \n \nEPA withdrew it in 2019.  During those six years, in \nresponse to the state standards and wider national \nand global trends, automakers invested heavily in \nchanging their fleets and building consumer demand \nfor electric vehicles.  Consumer preferences and the \nautomobile market evolved.  Even when EPA with-\ndrew the waiver, automakers accelerated their transi-\ntion to electric vehicles and consumer demand \ncontinued to grow. \nIn 2021, when EPA invited comment on whether to \nreinstate the waiver, the state respondents supported \nreinstatement.  As their comment explained, the with-\ndrawal had exceeded EPA\u2019s authority and it deprived \nCalifornia\u2019s regulations of legal effect.  But by the time \nEPA reinstated the waiver and petitioners challenged \nthat decision in 2022, \u201c\u2018both internal sustainability \ngoals and external market forces\u2019\u201d were pushing \n\u201cmanufacturers to transition toward electric vehicles, \nirrespective of California\u2019s regulations.\u201d  Pet. App. 24a \nn.8.  Indeed, publicly available evidence submitted by \nthe state respondents showed that zero-emission vehi-\ncles sold in California in 2022 already exceeded what \nthe relevant standards required.  Consumers were \nwilling to pay substantial price premiums for those ve-\nhicles.  And automakers had strong incentives to keep \nselling them. \nWhen the court of appeals confronted petitioners\u2019 \nchallenge to the reinstatement, it had to assure itself \nof jurisdiction by evaluating whether vacatur of that \nreinstatement would likely lead automakers to make \nchoices that would redress petitioners\u2019 asserted injury.  \nGiven the circumstances when petitioners filed suit in \nMay 2022, would automakers change their fleets or \nprices in a way that would increase demand for peti-\ntioners\u2019 liquid-fuel products?  Or would automakers \n\n \n3 \n \nexceed the requirements of California\u2019s standards for \ntheir own economic and strategic reasons, even with-\nout a legal requirement to do so?  Petitioners submit-\nted no evidence addressing that critical issue.  And \ngiven that absence of proof, the court of appeals \nproperly held that petitioners failed to meet their bur-\nden of demonstrating redressability. \nPetitioners ask this Court to excuse that failure.  \nThey first urge the Court to adopt a new \u201ccategorical \nrule.\u201d  Pet. Br. 4.  Under that rule, redressability \nwould be established automatically whenever peti-\ntioners challenge a regulation that implicates the use \nof their products\u2014even if the regulation applies only \nto third parties, and even where petitioners introduce \nno evidence indicating that those third parties would \nhave acted differently in the regulation\u2019s absence.  Id.  \nIn the alternative, petitioners ask the Court to credit \ntheir unsubstantiated predictions about how au-\ntomakers might respond to a vacatur.  Id. at 30-35.  \nThose arguments find no support in this Court\u2019s prec-\nedent.  Adopting them would effectively eliminate the \nplaintiff\u2019s \u201cburden of showing that third parties will \nlikely react\u201d to a favorable judgment in a way that pro-\nvides redress.  Dep\u2019t of Com. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, \n768 (2019).  And they would allow a court to assume \nredressability even if all the evidence before it indi-\ncates that a favorable judgment would not, in fact, re-\ndress the plaintiffs\u2019 injury.  This Court should reject \npetitioners\u2019 novel standing theories and affirm the \njudgment below. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal and Regulatory Background \n1.  The Clean Air Act directs EPA to prescribe fed-\neral standards governing emissions of air pollutants \n\n \n4 \n \nfrom new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle en-\ngines.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7521.  Section 209(a) of the Act gen-\nerally preempts States and their political subdivisions \nfrom \u201cadopt[ing] or attempt[ing] to enforce any stand-\nard relating to the control of emissions from new mo-\ntor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines.\u201d  Id. \n\u00a7 7543(a).  But Section 209(b) instructs EPA to \u201cwaive \napplication of [Section 209] to any State which ha[d] \nadopted\u201d qualifying emission standards \u201cprior to \nMarch 30, 1966, if the State determines that the State \nstandards will be, in the aggregate, at least as protec-\ntive of public health and welfare as applicable Federal \nstandards.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7543(b)(1).  If a State makes that de-\ntermination, EPA must waive preemption unless it \nmakes one of three enumerated findings.  See id. \n\u00a7 7543(b)(1)(A)-(C). \nCalifornia is the only State eligible for a waiver un-\nder Section 209(b) because it was the only State that \nhad developed qualifying motor vehicle emissions \nstandards before March 30, 1966.  Pet. App. 7a.  \u201cCon-\ngress recognized that California was already the \n\u2018lead[er] in the establishment of standards for regula-\ntion of automative pollutant emissions\u2019 at a time when \nthe federal government had yet to promulgate any reg-\nulations of its own.\u201d  Engine Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 88 \nF.3d 1075, 1079 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  Congress designed \nSection 209 to allow California to continue to serve as \na \u201c\u2018laboratory for innovation,\u2019\u201d id. at 1080, while also \n\u201cavoid[ing] the economic disruption\u201d that would come \nfrom manufacturers \u201chaving to meet fifty-one separate \nsets of emission control requirements,\u201d Motor & \nEquip. Mfrs. Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. EPA, 627 F.2d 1095, 1109 \n(D.C. Cir. 1979); see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7507 (1977 \namendment allowing other States to adopt standards \n\u201cidentical to the California standards for which a \nwaiver has been granted for such model year\u201d); Pet. \n\n \n5 \n \nApp. 9a n.3 (noting that \u201cseventeen states have chosen \nto adopt some portion of the California regulations\u201d). \nCalifornia received its first waiver in 1968 and has \nreceived additional waivers in every subsequent dec-\nade.1  For instance, EPA granted a waiver in 1993 for \nCalifornia\u2019s first Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) regula-\ntion, which required a specific percentage of light-duty \nvehicles to be zero-emission vehicles with no exhaust \nor evaporative emissions.  58 Fed. Reg. 4166 (Jan. 13, \n1993).2  EPA granted another waiver, in 2009, for Cal-\nifornia\u2019s first set of regulations to control greenhouse-\ngas emissions from motor vehicles.  74 Fed. Reg. \n32,744 (July 8, 2009). \n2.  This litigation concerns a set of emissions \nstandards that California adopted in 2012 as part of \nits Advanced Clean Cars I program.  78 Fed. Reg. 2112 \n(Jan. 9, 2013).  As relevant here, those standards in-\ncluded a requirement that automakers reduce the av-\nerage greenhouse-gas emissions across the fleets of \nvehicles they sell in California.  See id. at 2114.  They \nalso included new ZEV standards, requiring manufac-\nturers to meet specified \u201cZEV credit percentage\u201d re-\nquirements.  Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(b) \n(2012).   \nA manufacturer can satisfy the \u201cZEV credit per-\ncentage\u201d in several ways:  by generating credits from \nsales of qualifying vehicles, purchasing credits from \nother manufacturers, using excess credits banked in \nprior years, or applying credits obtained by overcom-\n \n1 See EPA, Vehicle Emissions California Waivers and Authoriza-\ntions, https://tinyurl.com/3rxscztw (last visited Mar. 6, 2025). \n2  See Cal. Air Res. Bd., Low-Emission Vehicle Program,  \nhttps://tinyurl.com/49m28yze (last visited Mar. 6, 2025). \n\n \n6 \n \nplying with the greenhouse-gas emission require-\nments.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(d)(5); 78 \nFed. Reg. at 2119-2120, 2135.  The number of ZEV \ncredits generated by a vehicle sale depends on the ve-\nhicle\u2019s range when operating on electric power.  See \nCal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(d)(5).  For example, a \nplug-in hybrid vehicle with a \u201c50 mile\u201d electric range \nearns one credit, while a fully battery-electric vehicle \nwith a \u201c350 mile\u201d range earns four credits.3  As a re-\nsult, a fleet may satisfy the standards even though \nZEV sales as a percentage of light-duty vehicles sold \nis well below the applicable ZEV credit percentage re-\nquirement.  \nThe Advanced Clean Cars I standards affected \nmodel years beginning in 2017 (for greenhouse-gas \nemissions) and 2018 (for ZEV requirements).  Both \nsets of standards were originally structured to in-\ncrease in stringency through model year 2025 and re-\nmain in effect at 2025 levels for subsequent model \nyears.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1961.3(a)(1)(A) \n(2012); id. \u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2012); J.A. 50.  In 2022, \nhowever, California amended the ZEV standards (but \nnot the greenhouse-gas standards) to expire after \nmodel year 2025.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \n\u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2022).4 \n \n3 78 Fed. Reg. at 2114-2115; see Cal. Air Res. Bd., ACC II ZEV \nTechnology Assessment, at 11-12 tbl. 2 (Apr. 12, 2022) (showing \nelectric ranges of model year 2021 battery and plug-in hybrid ve-\nhicles), https://tinyurl.com/2d2db9vc (last visited Mar. 11, 2025).  \n4  California adopted that amendment because its Advanced \nClean Cars II standards included a new set of ZEV requirements \napplicable to model years 2026 and beyond.  See Cal. Code Regs. \ntit. 13, \u00a7 1962.4(a) (2022).  EPA granted a waiver for the Ad-\nvanced Clean Cars II standards on December 17, 2024.  90 Fed. \n(continued\u2026) \n\n \n7 \n \nCalifornia requested a waiver for the Advanced \nClean Cars I program in 2012.  That request described \nhow the new standards would increase production of \nzero-emission vehicles, thus decreasing emissions of \ncriteria pollutants and greenhouse gases.  J.A. 34-35, \n40-44.  EPA granted the waiver in early 2013.  78 Fed. \nReg. at 2145.  As the Federal Register notice of that \naction observed, petitions for judicial review were due \nby March 11, 2013.  Id.; see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1).  No-\nbody challenged EPA\u2019s decision to grant the waiver. \nMore than six years later, EPA withdrew the parts \nof the waiver at issue in this case.  84 Fed. Reg. 51,310 \n(Sept. 27, 2019).  By that time, automakers had made \n\u201cinvestments to meet\u201d the greenhouse-gas and ZEV \nstandards and \u201chad adjusted their fleets to comply \nwith\u201d them.  Pet. App. 12a; see id. at 124a.  Consumers \nhad grown increasingly familiar with zero-emission \nvehicles.  Even after the waiver was withdrawn, con-\nsumer demand for those vehicles continued to grow \nand automakers continued to announce plans to sell \nthem in greater numbers.  J.A. 191-192, 201-203.  By \n2020, for example, zero-emission vehicles were around \n8% of the new light-duty vehicles registered in Califor-\nnia; that figure jumped to over 12% the following \nyear.5 \nIn 2021, EPA solicited comment on whether it \nshould reinstate the waiver.  The state respondents \nsubmitted a comment in July 2021, explaining that \n \nReg. 642 (2025).  Several challenges to that waiver are now pend-\ning, including one that two of the petitioners here filed on Febru-\nary 28, 2025.  Pet. for Rev., Valero Renewable Fuels Co., LLC v. \nEPA, No. 25-1078 (D.C. Cir.).   \n5 Cal. Energy Comm\u2019n, New ZEV Sales in California, https://ti-\nnyurl.com/pt526fp5 (displaying \u201cZEV Sales Share\u201d in top-right \ncorner when 2020 and 2021 filters are selected). \n\n \n8 \n \nthe withdrawal was unlawful and poorly reasoned.  \nC.A. J.A. 188-215; see J.A. 51-68.  Auto-industry com-\nmenters emphasized the \u201cbillions of dollars of invest-\nment \nin \nelectric \nvehicle \nmanufacturing \nand \ninfrastructure\u201d that automakers had already made as \na result of the 2013 decision to grant the waiver.  J.A. \n103 (National Coalition for Advanced Transportation \ncomment); cf. J.A. 63 (California comment observing \nthat \u201cautomakers have complied with, and often over-\ncomplied with, model years 2017-2020 already\u201d).  EPA \nreinstated the waiver in March 2022.  87 Fed. Reg. \n14,332 (Mar. 14, 2022). \nB. Procedural Background \n1.  The petitioners here are various companies that \nproduce or sell liquid fuels, as well as related trade as-\nsociations.  Pet. App. 2a.  They filed petitions for re-\nview of EPA\u2019s reinstatement decision in the D.C. \nCircuit on May 12, 2022.  Id. at 15a.  The court of ap-\npeals consolidated those cases, along with another \ncase initiated by a group of States led by Ohio.  Id.  \nShortly thereafter, the state respondents here filed an \nunopposed motion for leave to intervene in support of \nEPA, as did various automakers and public-interest \norganizations.  Id. at 15a & nn.4-6; see J.A. 107.  Those \nmotions were granted.  See Pet. App. 15a. \nPetitioners principally argued that EPA\u2019s rein-\nstatement of the waiver contravened the Clean Air \nAct.  Pet. App. 16a.  Before the court of appeals could \nreach the merits of that claim, however, it had to as-\nsure itself of jurisdiction.  Under longstanding circuit \nrules, the opening brief for a petitioner seeking review \nof agency action \u201cmust set forth the basis for the claim \nof standing.\u201d  D.C. Cir. R. 28(a)(7).  And if \u201cstanding is \nnot apparent from the administrative record, the brief \nmust include arguments and evidence establishing the \n\n \n9 \n \nclaim of standing.\u201d  Id.; see also Sierra Club v. EPA, \n292 F.3d 895, 901 (D.C. Cir. 2002). \nPetitioners\u2019 opening brief below devoted just two \nparagraphs to standing.  J.A. 118-119.  Petitioners ex-\nplained that \u201cdepressing the demand\u201d for liquid fuels \n\u201cinjures petitioners and petitioners\u2019 members finan-\ncially.\u201d  Id. at 118.  They cited documents from Cali-\nfornia\u2019s 2011 rulemaking in which a California agency \nhad forecast the prospect of financial injury to oil and \ngas industry participants.  Id. (citing C.A. J.A. 799, \n801, 830, 832).  Petitioners asserted that \u201c[t]his eco-\nnomic injury . . . is caused by the challenged regula-\ntory action, and this Court can redress that injury by \nsetting aside the action.\u201d  J.A. 118.  They attached 14 \ndeclarations, but the only discussion of redressability \nin those declarations consisted of unsupported asser-\ntions that vacatur would remedy petitioners\u2019 injury.  \nId. at 130, 137, 150, 154, 158, 167. \nIn response, the state respondents argued that pe-\ntitioners had failed to establish standing, emphasizing \nthat petitioners provided no evidence that vacatur of \nthe reinstatement decision in May 2022 would change \nautomakers\u2019 behavior in a way that would increase \nfuel sales.  J.A. 185-187.  The state respondents also \nsubmitted evidence undermining the likelihood of any \nsuch change:  by 2022, sales of zero-emission vehicles \nin California exceeded what was required by the rele-\nvant standards; consumer demand for those vehicles \nwas growing, as was consumer willingness to pay price \npremiums; and many manufacturers had announced \nplans for even greater zero-emission vehicle sales in \nthe future.  Id. at 191-195, 201-203.  On reply, peti-\ntioners did not submit record evidence countering the \nstate respondents\u2019 evidence about the circumstances \nin 2022.  See id. at 209-211. \n\n \n10 \n \nAt oral argument, the panel questioned petitioners \nabout jurisdiction, with a particular focus on the \u201car-\ngument that you haven\u2019t demonstrated redressabil-\nity.\u201d  C.A. Oral Arg. 25:50-26:12.  Two weeks later, \npetitioners sought leave to file a supplemental brief \nand to supplement the record with two new declara-\ntions.  Pet. App. 30a.  The proposed brief and declara-\ntions mostly addressed the separate issue of mootness.  \nSee C.A. Private Pet. Proposed Supp. Br. 1-3, 4-13.  In \na short section on standing, petitioners characterized \nthe arguments against redressability as \u201cimplausible\u201d \nand \u201cincredible,\u201d id. at 3, 4\u2014but again cited no evi-\ndence establishing how judicial relief in May 2022 \nwould have redressed their asserted injuries, and did \nnot attempt to counter the state respondents\u2019 evidence \non that point.   \n2.  The court of appeals concluded that it lacked ju-\nrisdiction to decide petitioners\u2019 challenge because pe-\ntitioners had failed to establish Article III standing.  \nPet. App. 16a-19a.  Without deciding whether petition-\ners had established injury or causation, the court ex-\nplained that petitioners fell \u201cfar short of meeting their \nburden\u201d to establish a likelihood \u201cthat their alleged \ninjuries would be redressed\u201d if the court agreed with \npetitioners\u2019 merits theory and vacated EPA\u2019s rein-\nstatement decision.  Id. at 21a. \nAs the court explained, redressability for petition-\ners \u201c\u2018hinge[d] on\u2019 the actions of third parties\u2014the au-\ntomobile manufacturers who are subject to the \nwaiver.\u201d  Pet. App. 22a.  Petitioners needed to show \nthat automakers would respond to vacatur of the rein-\nstatement \u201cby producing and selling fewer non-con-\nventional vehicles or by altering the prices of their \nvehicles such that fewer non-conventional vehicles\u2014\nand more conventional vehicles\u2014were sold.\u201d  Id.  But \n\n \n11 \n \nthe record indicated \u201cthat \u2018manufacturers are already \nselling more qualifying vehicles in California than the \nState\u2019s standards require,\u2019\u201d id. at 28a, and \u201cthat \u2018both \ninternal sustainability goals and external market \nforces\u2019 are prompting manufacturers to transition to-\nward electric vehicles, irrespective of California\u2019s reg-\nulations,\u201d id. at 24a n.8; see also id. at 28a. \nNevertheless, the court of appeals observed, peti-\ntioners \u201ctreated redressability as a foregone conclu-\nsion\u201d instead of making a factual showing.  Pet. App. \n25a.  They did not \u201cattempt[] to explain in any detail \nhow their injuries are redressable, let alone to \u2018cit[e] \nany record evidence\u2019 or to file \u2018additional affidavits or \nother evidence sufficient to support\u2019 redressability.\u201d  \nId. at 24a-25a.  Nor did petitioners \u201cmeaningfully ad-\ndress[]\u201d redressability on reply, after the state re-\nspondents \nintroduced \narguments \nand \nevidence \ncontesting redressability.  Id. at 28a.  \u201cUltimately, the \nrecord evidence, coupled with the filings of the EPA \nand intervenors, provide[d] th[e] Court with no basis \nto conclude that Petitioners\u2019 claims are redressable\u2014\na necessary element of standing that Petitioners bear \nthe burden of establishing.\u201d  Id. at 29a. \nThe court of appeals also described its understand-\ning that the challenge before it \u201cconcern[ed] only\u201d the \nreinstatement of the waiver \u201cas to Model Years 2017 \nthrough 2025.\u201d  Pet. App. 22a.  But see supra p. 6; infra \np. 44.  On that understanding, the court explained, pe-\ntitioners had to show \u201cnot only that automobile man-\nufacturers are likely to respond to a decision by this \nCourt by changing their fleets in a way that alleviates \n[petitioners\u2019] injuries in some way, but also that auto-\nmobile manufacturers would do so relatively quickly\u2014\nby Model Year 2025.\u201d  Pet. App. 23a.  That timing ele-\n\n \n12 \n \nment \u201cfurther complicated\u201d the redressability analy-\nsis,\u201d in the court\u2019s view.  Id. at 22a.  \u201c[E]ven if\u201d peti-\ntioners \nhad \nestablished \nthat \n\u201cautomobile \nmanufacturers were inclined to change course\u201d in re-\nsponse to a vacatur in a way that would increase fuel \nsales, it was \u201cfar from clear that they could do so\u201d by \nmodel year 2025.  Id. at 24a; see id. at 23a. \nFinally, the court of appeals denied petitioners\u2019 \npost-argument motion for leave to file a supplemental \nbrief and declarations.  Pet. App. 30a-32a.  The court \nexplained that, under the circumstances, petitioners \nshould have understood their obligation to address re-\ndressability in their opening brief.  Id. at 31a.  Moreo-\nver, \u201c[p]etitioners offer[ed] no explanation for having \nfailed to address redressability in their reply brief af-\nter California raised the issue in its opposition brief.\u201d  \nId. at 32a. \nPetitioners did not seek panel rehearing or rehear-\ning en banc.  They instead filed a petition for a writ of \ncertiorari respecting both the redressability question \nand the merits of their statutory claim (which the \ncourt of appeals had not reached).  This Court granted \ncertiorari on the redressability question only.6 \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nPetitioners sought a judgment vacating EPA\u2019s re-\ninstatement of a nearly decade-old waiver.  Under set-\ntled precedent, petitioners had the burden of \nestablishing that automakers would likely respond to \n \n6 This Court also denied a petition for certiorari filed by Ohio and \nother petitioners, which advanced a separate constitutional \nclaim.  See Ohio v. EPA, No. 24-13 (Dec. 16, 2024).  The court of \nappeals had held that the Ohio petitioners established standing \nto bring that claim, but it rejected the claim on the merits.  See \nPet. App. 32a-49a. \n\n \n13 \n \nthat vacatur in ways that would increase demand for \npetitioners\u2019 liquid-fuel products.  By the time they \nfiled suit in May 2022, however, the likely effect of a \nvacatur was not self-evident:  in the nine years since \nEPA first granted the waiver, automakers had made \nenormous investments in producing and marketing \nzero-emission vehicles; consumer demand for those ve-\nhicles had recently surged; and evidence before the \nCourt indicated that automakers would continue to \nsell those vehicles in large numbers regardless of the \nreinstatement or its potential vacatur.  Article III re-\nquired petitioners to introduce current evidence but-\ntressing their assertion that a vacatur in 2022 would \nlead automakers to change their fleets or prices in \nways that would increase liquid-fuel sales.  Because \npetitioners did not even attempt to do so, the court of \nappeals properly held that they failed to establish \nstanding. \nIn this Court, petitioners advance several novel \ntheories for why they had no obligation to introduce \nany evidence of redressability.  None of those theories \nis persuasive.  They first propose a categorical rule \nthat redressability is automatically established when-\never a challenged government action implicates the \nuse of the challenger\u2019s products.  Pet. Br. 17-18.  Prec-\nedent forecloses that proposal:  this Court has consist-\nently focused on the particular facts of a case\u2014and \nrequired challengers to submit specific evidence sup-\nporting redressability before obtaining a final judg-\nment.  For similar reasons, plaintiffs may not rely on \nunsupported predictions about the effects of a judg-\nment on a third party\u2019s choices.  See id. at 18.  They \nmust instead meet \u201ctheir burden of showing that third \nparties will likely react in predictable ways\u201d by intro-\nducing actual evidence.  Dep\u2019t of Com. v. New York, \n588 U.S. 752, 768 (2019).  And the fact that a statute \n\n \n14 \n \nor regulation \u201cdoes not sunset\u201d (Pet. Br. 19) does not, \nby itself, establish standing to challenge it. \nFinally, petitioners\u2019 belated attempts to identify \nrecord evidence supporting redressability cannot \nchange the outcome here.  Their briefs and declara-\ntions below were conclusory on the subject of redress-\nability.  The additional evidence they describe in this \nCourt not only comes too late, it would have been in-\nsufficient even if they had presented it below:  it con-\nsists of outdated projections that cannot substitute for \nevidence about the market as it existed when petition-\ners filed this challenge in May 2022. \nARGUMENT \nI. PETITIONERS FAILED TO ESTABLISH REDRESSA-\nBILITY \nPetitioners had the burden to establish standing.  \nAs to redressability, they had to show that judicial va-\ncatur of the reinstatement decision at the time they \nfiled suit in May 2022 would likely lead to increased \nfuel sales.  They failed to carry that burden.   \nA. It Was Petitioners\u2019 Burden to Introduce \nEvidence Establishing Each Element of \nArticle III Standing \nBefore turning to the merits of a suit, a court must \nassure itself of jurisdiction.  Summers v. Earth Island \nInst., 555 U.S. 488, 499 (2009).  The \u201cburden of estab-\nlishing\u201d jurisdiction lies with \u201cthe party asserting ju-\nrisdiction.\u201d  Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., \n511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994) (citing McNutt v. Gen. Motors \nAcceptance Corp. of Ind., 298 U.S. 178, 182-183 \n(1936)). \nStanding is \u201can essential and unchanging part\u201d of \nArticle III jurisdiction.  Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 \n\n \n15 \n \nU.S. 555, 560 (1992).  The doctrine of standing is built \non \u201cthe idea of separation of powers.\u201d  United States v. \nTexas, 599 U.S. 670, 675 (2023).  It \u201cimplements \u2018the \nFramers\u2019 concept of the proper\u2014and properly lim-\nited\u2014role of the courts in a democratic society.\u2019\u201d  FDA \nv. All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 380 (2024) \n(quoting Roberts, Article III Limits on Statutory \nStanding, 42 Duke L.J. 1219, 1220 (1993)). \nThe \u201cirreducible constitutional minimum of stand-\ning contains three elements.\u201d  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560.  \nFirst, the party bringing suit \u201cmust have suffered an \n\u2018injury in fact.\u2019\u201d  Id.  Second, that injury must \u201cbe \n\u2018fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defend-\nant, and not the result of the independent action of \nsome third party not before the court.\u2019\u201d  Id. (altera-\ntions omitted).  And third, \u201cit must be \u2018likely,\u2019 as op-\nposed to merely \u2018speculative,\u2019 that the injury will be \n\u2018redressed by a favorable decision.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 561.  Each \nelement is assessed as of the time the suit commenced.  \nMurthy v. Missouri, 603 U.S. 43, 58 (2024). \nA party seeking to invoke the jurisdiction of a fed-\neral court \u201cmust support each element of standing \n\u2018with the manner and degree of evidence required at \nthe successive stages of the litigation.\u2019\u201d  Murthy, 603 \nU.S. at 58.  At the outset of litigation, \u201c\u2018mere allega-\ntions\u2019\u201d may suffice; as the case progresses, a party \n\u201cmust . . . point to factual evidence.\u201d  Id.  A petitioner \nwho challenges agency action may be able to carry its \nburden by identifying evidence in the administrative \nrecord that establishes its standing.  See, e.g., Sierra \nClub v. EPA, 292 F.3d 895, 899-900 (D.C. Cir. 2002).  \nBut if \u201cstanding is not apparent from the administra-\ntive record,\u201d a petitioner\u2019s \u201cbrief must include argu-\nments and evidence establishing the claim of \nstanding.\u201d  D.C. Cir. R. 28(a)(7); see Sierra Club, 292 \n\n \n16 \n \nF.3d at 900; see generally 15 Redish, Moore\u2019s Federal \nPractice \u00a7\u00a7 101.31, 101.61[10] (3d ed. & Supp. 2025). \nSometimes standing analysis is straightforward.  \nFor instance, in some cases the party invoking the \ncourt\u2019s jurisdiction is itself \u201can object of\u201d the chal-\nlenged government action.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.  \nThe government might, for example, proscribe speech \nthat the plaintiff engages in.  See, e.g., Susan B. An-\nthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 161-167 (2014).  \nOr it might require a state plaintiff to engage in par-\nticular regulation.  See, e.g., West Virginia v. EPA, 597 \nU.S. 697, 718-719 (2022).  In those scenarios, \u201cthere is \nordinarily little question that the action . . . has \ncaused [the plaintiff] injury, and that a judgment pre-\nventing . . . the action will redress\u201d that injury.  Lujan, \n504 U.S. at 561-562; see All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 \nU.S. at 382. \nIn other scenarios, \u201cmuch more is needed.\u201d  Lujan, \n504 U.S. at 562.  When a party\u2019s \u201casserted injury \narises from the government\u2019s allegedly unlawful regu-\nlation . . . of someone else,\u201d for example, standing can \nbe \u201c\u2018substantially more difficult\u2019 to establish.\u201d  Id.  In \nthose cases, \u201ccausation and redressability ordinarily \nhinge on the response of\u201d that third party\u2014\u201cand per-\nhaps on the response of others as well.\u201d  Id.  Because \nthe inquiry turns on \u201cchoices made by independent ac-\ntors not before the courts,\u201d the plaintiff must \u201cadduce \nfacts showing that those choices have been or will be \nmade in such manner as to produce causation and per-\nmit redressability of injury.\u201d  Id.  For instance, if plain-\ntiffs are injured by the lack of affordable private \nhousing, they must show \u201can actionable causal rela-\ntionship\u201d between the challenged zoning ordinance \nand the choices of private third parties who build and \nsell housing.  Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 507 \n\n \n17 \n \n(1975).  Their claim may not proceed if the asserted \ninjury instead results from \u201cthe economics of the area \nhousing market.\u201d  Id. at 506; see generally id. at 508 \n(requiring the party \u201cwho seeks to challenge\u201d a gov-\nernment action to introduce \u201cspecific, concrete facts \ndemonstrating . . . that he personally would benefit in \na tangible way from the court\u2019s intervention\u201d). \nConcrete evidence from the plaintiff is especially \ncritical if another party has introduced evidence un-\ndermining the asserted theory of standing.  \u201cWhen \nchallenged by . . . an opposing party,\u201d for example, a \nplaintiff \u201cinvoking the court\u2019s jurisdiction cannot \nsimply allege a nonobvious harm, without more.\u201d  \nWittman v. Personhuballah, 578 U.S. 539, 545 (2016).  \nAnd if \u201cthere is no \u2018more,\u2019\u201d then there is no jurisdic-\ntion.  Id.; see generally Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U.S. \n77, 96-97 (2010) (when defendants raise facts calling \njurisdiction into doubt, plaintiffs \u201cmust support their \nallegations by competent proof\u201d). \nB. The Circumstances of This Case Raised a \nSerious Question as to Whether Petition-\ners\u2019 Claim Was Redressable \nAs the court of appeals recognized, this is not a case \nwhere standing is self-evident.  Petitioners comprise \ncompanies that produce or refine fuel, companies that \ndevelop biorefining technology, and various trade as-\nsociations (for energy companies, farmers, and con-\nvenience store owners).  Pet. Br. II-V, 20.  They claim \nan injury of financial harm from reduced fuel sales.  \nId. at 21-22.  But the standards at issue here do not \nregulate fuel production or sales.  Instead, the stand-\nards regulate an activity in which petitioners do not \nparticipate:  automobile sales.  Because petitioners are \nnot directly regulated by the challenged agency action, \n\n \n18 \n \nthey needed to identify evidence showing that au-\ntomakers who are subject to those standards would \nmake choices that would \u201cproduce causation and per-\nmit redressability of injury.\u201d  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 562. \nPetitioners\u2019 theory is that the state emissions \nstandards injure them by effectively requiring au-\ntomakers to sell more \u201cvehicles that use less or no liq-\nuid fuel,\u201d which reduces demand for petitioners\u2019 \nproducts.  Pet. Br. 17.  They posit that their revenues \nwould increase if the standards no longer had legal ef-\nfect, because automakers would then make and sell \nmore cars that run on liquid fuel.  Id. at 24.  That the-\nory would indeed have been \u201cstraightforward\u201d (id. at \n35) if petitioners had promptly sought review follow-\ning EPA\u2019s original approval of the waiver in 2013\u2014as \nthey recently did in challenging the Advanced Clean \nCars II waiver, see supra p. 6 n.4.7 \nIn calendar year 2013, zero-emission vehicles made \nup about 2% of light-duty vehicle sales in California.8  \nTo meet the \u201cminimum ZEV credit percentage\u201d re-\nquirements of the Advanced Clean Cars I standards, \n \n7 Petitioners have suggested that D.C. Circuit precedent prohib-\nited them from challenging the 2013 action because California \ndeemed compliance with federal standards to satisfy the state \nstandards.

Cal. Code \nRegs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2012).  Regulators es-\ntimated that meeting that 22% credit requirement \nwould require zero-emission vehicles to comprise \nabout 15% of light-duty new-vehicle sales by 2025.  See \nJ.A. 16, 32; 78 Fed. Reg. 2112, 2119 (Jan. 9, 2013).  Ab-\nsent the new regulatory requirement, there was no \nreason to think automakers would make that shift for \ntheir own independent reasons.  Consumers in 2013 \nwere largely unfamiliar with zero-emission vehicles or \nhad a negative impression of them.9  And automakers \nwarned that \u201cconsumer demand for ZEVs\u201d was so ane-\nmic that they might not even be able to meet the re-\nquirements for model year 2018.  78 Fed.

Br. 18, 34, 35) in \nMay 2022 that reduced sales of petitioners\u2019 fuel prod-\nucts were caused by the reinstatement of the waiver\u2014\ninstead of market forces and automakers\u2019 prior invest-\nments and plans.  Nor was it obvious that vacatur of \nthe reinstatement would likely affect automakers\u2019 fu-\nture behavior in a way that would redress the asserted \ninjury. \nIndeed, evidence submitted by the state respond-\nents indicated the opposite.  Publicly accessible sales \ndata showed that \u201czero-emission vehicles sold in cal-\nendar year 2022\u201d in California \u201cexceed what [the] \nstandards require.\u201d  J.A. 192.  For that calendar year, \nabout 19% of light-duty vehicles sold in the State qual-\nified as zero-emission vehicles under California\u2019s \nstandards\u2014exceeding the 15% that regulators had \nforecast would be needed for compliance.  Id. at 191-\n192; see supra p. 19.  The lion\u2019s share of those sales \n(16% of total light-duty sales) were battery-electric ve-\nhicles.13   \nThat represented a surge in sales of battery-elec-\ntric vehicles that far outpaced early forecasts.  The \nforecasts had projected that automakers would need \nbattery-electric vehicles to be just 3.7% of total light-\nduty sales by model year 2025 to meet the credit re-\nquirements of the ZEV standards.  J.A. 9.  The unex-\npected consumer shift to battery-electric vehicles \n(rather than plug-in hybrids, as forecasters originally \n \n13\n New \nZEV \nSales \nin \nCalifornia, \nsupra, \nhttps://ti-\nnyurl.com/pt526fp5 (displaying 262,076 \u201cBEV\u201d out of 1,581,844 \nannual light-duty sales when 2022 filter is selected). \n\n \n22 \n \nanticipated) had profound consequences for automak-\ners\u2019 compliance with the Advanced Clean Cars I stand-\nards.  Because battery-electric vehicles can travel \nlonger distances without emitting tailpipe pollutants, \nthey yield the most \u201cZEV credits\u201d for purposes of the \nstandards.  See supra p. 6.  So the fact that 16% of \nlight-duty sales were battery-electric vehicles in 2022 \nyielded a ZEV credit percentage for that year that was \nfar above the highest requirement that the standards \nwould ever impose.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \n\u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2012) (22% ZEV credit requirement \nstarting in model year 2025).  And sales in California \nin 2022 were also exceeding the most stringent re-\nquirements of the fleetwide greenhouse-gas stand-\nards, even for future years, because the battery-\nelectric vehicles also have far lower emissions than \nplug-in hybrids.  See J.A. 7. \nBy May 2022, nine years after EPA first granted a \nwaiver for the Advanced Clean Cars I standards, there \nwas substantial reason to believe that automakers \nwould exceed the standards for their own reasons even \nwithout the reinstatement.  The court of appeals could \nnot \u201cpresume[]\u201d that petitioners\u2019 challenge was re-\ndressable.  Kokkonen, 511 U.S. at 377.

Article III required the \ncourt to ask whether petitioners had \u201cmet their bur-\nden\u201d by introducing evidence demonstrating that au-\ntomakers would \u201clikely react\u201d to a vacatur of the 2022 \nreinstatement in ways that would increase demand for \npetitioners\u2019 products and services.

Petitioners Did Not Introduce Evidence \nEstablishing Redressability \nPetitioners did not carry their evidentiary burden.  \nIndeed, they submitted virtually no argument or evi-\ndence bearing on the likely effect of a vacatur on the \nmarket as it existed in 2022.   \n1.  Petitioners\u2019 opening brief in the court of appeals \ndevoted one sentence to redressability.  They asserted \nthat their \u201cinjury is caused by the challenged regula-\ntory action, and this Court can redress that injury by \nsetting aside the action.\u201d  J.A. 118.  That single con-\nclusory statement was not supported by any citation \nto evidence in the administrative record or elsewhere.  \nPetitioners attached 14 standing declarations to their \nopening brief.  See J.A. 120-184.  But none of those \ndeclarations was sufficient to carry their burden. \nThe bulk of each declaration described the declar-\nant\u2019s asserted injuries, with details supporting the \n(undisputed) proposition that petitioners and their \nmembers profit from fuel sales.  The declarants had \nalmost nothing to say about the critical question going \nto causation and redressability, which \u201care often \u2018flip \nsides of the same coin.\u2019\u201d  All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 \nU.S. at 380.  That question was whether, in 2022, the \nreinstatement of the waiver or the vacatur of that re-\ninstatement would affect automakers\u2019 choices in a \nmanner leading to changes in fuel sales.   \nOf the declarants who addressed causation, some \nasserted their \u201cunderstand[ing] that California\u2019s \ngreenhouse-gas standards and zero-emission-vehicle \nmandate reduce the demand for fuel in California.\u201d  \nJ.A. 125, 140, 169, 183; see also J.A. 176.  Those asser-\ntions were not accompanied by supporting facts or any \ndiscussion of the circumstances in 2022.  Other declar-\nants invoked statements from California about how \n\n \n24 \n \nthe standards would reduce demand for liquid fuels.  \nId. at 129, 136-137, 148, 153, 157, 166, 173, 180.  Peti-\ntioners now describe those statements as \u201crecent[] \nproject[ions] that the waiver would \u2018reduce emissions \nthrough reductions in fuel production.\u2019\u201d  Pet. Br. 38 \n(citing J.A. 148, 180).  But the projections are not \u201cre-\ncent\u201d at all.  They are from California\u2019s \u201c2012 Waiver \nRequest\u201d\u2014and state rulemaking documents submit-\nted as part of that request\u2014prepared a decade before \nthe challenged reinstatement and petitioners\u2019 suit.  \nJ.A. 148, 180; see also id. at 180 (citing state estimates \nfrom 2011).  Those outdated sources did not establish \nthat any reduced fuel sales in 2022 were caused by the \nwaiver\u2019s reinstatement instead of the dramatic \nchanges in the market and consumer demand that \npredated the reinstatement.14  \nThe declarants who addressed redressability did so \nin a single boilerplate sentence asserting that petition-\ners\u2019 \u201cinjuries would be substantially ameliorated if \nEPA\u2019s decision were set aside.\u201d  J.A. 130, 137, 150, \n154, 158, 167, 181; see Pet. App. 21a-22a.  Again, not \none of the declarants addressed the state of the market \nin 2022, when petitioners filed their suit.  Nor did they \nsay a word about automakers\u2019 behavior at that time, \nor the economic and other considerations that would \nshape automakers\u2019 response to a judicial vacatur.

They also quoted statements \nfrom the state respondents\u2019 July 2021 comment in sup-\nport of the reinstatement.  Id. at 210; see Pet. Br. 38 \n(citing J.A. 66).  Those statements explained why \nEPA\u2019s 2019 decision to revoke the waiver was unjusti-\nfied based on the record EPA had before it in that year, \nsee J.A. 66 (citing 84 Fed. Reg. 51,310, 51,337 (Sept. \n27, 2019)), and then described California\u2019s \u201cdemon-\nstration in its 2012 waiver request,\u201d J.A. 66.  Neither \nstatement could have taken account of the market \ndata showing that zero-emission vehicle sales tripled \nbetween 2020 and mid-2022.  See id. at 191. \nAnd petitioners\u2019 reply (J.A. 208-212) did not mean-\ningfully address that more recent data either\u2014or the \nevidence showing that market penetration of zero-\nemission vehicles in California in 2022 far exceeded \nany current or future requirement of the relevant \nstandards.  Nor did petitioners respond to the evidence \nindicating that automakers would \u201cha[ve] a similar in-\ncentive to engage in\u201d the promotion and sale of zero-\n\n \n26 \n \nemission vehicles even if the standards were not in ef-\nfect.

Because petition-\ners did not provide the court of appeals with any facts \nshowing a likelihood that vacating EPA\u2019s 2022 rein-\nstatement would redress their asserted injuries, the \ncourt properly held that it lacked jurisdiction to decide \nthe merits.

PETITIONERS IDENTIFY NO VALID BASIS FOR RE-\nVERSAL \nHaving failed \u201cto \u2018cit[e] any record evidence\u2019 or to \nfile \u2018additional affidavits or other evidence sufficient to \nsupport\u2019 redressability\u201d in the court below, Pet. App. \n24a-25a, petitioners now ask this Court to hold that \nthey did \u201cnot need to supply additional record evi-\ndence,\u201d Pet. Br. 17.  They advance three theories:  \n(i) that the Court should \u201cadopt [a] categorical rule\u201d \nthat this type of government action \u201calone suffices to \nestablish redressability,\u201d id. at 17, 18; (ii) that redress-\nability follows from the purported \u201cpredictable effects\u201d \nof the 2022 reinstatement on automakers, id. at 18; \nand (iii) that the duration of the challenged waiver, by \nitself, establishes redressability, see id. at 19, 45-47.  \nBut this Court\u2019s precedent forecloses those theories.  \nAnd petitioners\u2019 attempt to argue, in the alternative, \nthat the record contains \u201cplenty [of] evidence\u201d support-\ning redressability (id. at 37) ignores the gulf between \nthe referenced evidence and the question that mat-\ntered:  how automakers would likely have responded \nto a decision vacating the waiver in May 2022.   \n\n \n28 \n \nA. Government Regulations Implicating the \nUse of a Product Do Not Categorically Es-\ntablish Standing for Producers to Sue \nPetitioners first propose a categorical rule that re-\ndressability is automatically established in every chal-\nlenge seeking to \u201cremove a regulatory impediment to \nthe use of petitioners\u2019 products.\u201d  Pet. Br. 17.  They \nnever clarify the scope of the word \u201cimpediment.\u201d  But \nit appears that their rule would cover a flat prohibition \non the use of a product as well as any lesser restriction \nthat allegedly affects or implicates its use.  And the \nrule would apply even where (as here) the record con-\ntains evidence indicating that a favorable judgment \nwould not actually redress the asserted injury.  That \nnovel proposal finds no basis in this Court\u2019s precedent.  \nFor a court to conclude that it has jurisdiction, the \n\u201c\u2018specific facts\u2019\u201d matter\u2014as does the \u201cevidence\u201d sub-\nmitted by the parties.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561. \n1. Petitioners\u2019 proposed rule is at odds \nwith the precedent they invoke \nPetitioners point to Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154 \n(1997), as support for their proposed rule.  Pet. Br. 25-\n26.  That decision reiterated that an injury resulting \nfrom \u201cthe independent action of some third party not \nbefore the court\u201d is insufficient to establish Article III \nstanding.  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 169 (internal quotation \nmarks and emphasis omitted).  It also noted that the \nbar on standing for injuries caused by independent ac-\ntion does not \u201cexclude injury produced by determina-\ntive or coercive effect\u201d of a government action on the \nchoices of a third party.  Id.  Bennett thus confirms the \ncommon-sense proposition that a petitioner is not nec-\nessarily foreclosed from establishing redressability \njust because a third party is \u201cthe very last step in the \n\n \n29 \n \nchain of causation.\u201d  Id.; see also Lujan, 504 U.S. at \n562. \nBut Bennett hardly supports petitioners\u2019 sweeping \ntheory that redressability is automatically established \nwhenever a challenger simply asserts some \u201cregula-\ntory impediment\u201d (Pet. Br. 25) to the use of its product.  \nTo the contrary, the Court\u2019s decision underscores how \nmuch the particular facts of a case matter.  In Bennett, \nranchers and irrigation districts challenged a Fish and \nWildlife Service biological opinion that proposed min-\nimum water levels for a water project.  But a third \nparty (the Bureau of Reclamation) \u201cretain[ed] ulti-\nmate responsibility\u201d for deciding whether to adopt the \nproposal.  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 168.  With respect to \ncausation and redressability, the main question was \nwhether the Bureau would in fact feel constrained to \ndo what the Service suggested.   \nScrutinizing the facts before it, the Court deter-\nmined that\u2014\u201cin reality\u201d\u2014the biological opinion would \nhave a \u201cdeterminative or coercive effect\u201d on the Bu-\nreau\u2019s action.  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 169.  Although the \nopinion was theoretically advisory, the Service had \nacknowledged \u201cthe virtually determinative effect of its \nbiological opinions.\u201d  Id. at 170.  And the Solicitor Gen-\neral conceded that this particular opinion would have \n\u201ca powerful coercive effect\u201d on the Bureau.  Id. at 169.  \nBefore the opinion, the Bureau had operated the water \nproject \u201cin the same manner throughout the 20th cen-\ntury.\u201d  Id. at 170.  But the Bureau had notified the \nService that in the future it \u201cintended to act in accord-\nance with\u201d the recommendations in the Service\u2019s opin-\nion.16  Those facts showed that the opinion (not some \n \n16 Resp. Br., Bennett v. Spear, No. 95-813 (U.S.), 1996 WL 396714, \n(continued\u2026) \n\n \n30 \n \nother motivation) would cause the Bureau to alter its \nbehavior.  And they allowed the Court to hold that pe-\ntitioners\u2019 injury would \u201c\u2018likely\u2019 be redressed\u2014i.e., the \nBureau will not impose [the] water level restrictions\u2014\nif the Biological Opinion is set aside.\u201d  Bennett, 520 \nU.S. at 170-171.   \nThe other cases invoked by petitioners featured \nsimilar factual assessments.  In Pierce v. Society of the \nSisters of the Holy Names of Jesus & Mary, 268 U.S. \n510 (1925), the law prohibiting parents from sending \ntheir children to private schools had \u201ccaused the with-\ndrawal from [the plaintiff\u2019s] schools of children who \nwould otherwise continue.\u201d  Id. at 532 (emphasis \nadded).  In CBS, Inc. v. United States, 316 U.S. 407, \n414, 423 (1942), an affidavit from the plaintiff radio \nnetwork made clear that radio stations were in fact \n\u201ccancelling or threatening to cancel their contracts in \norder to conform to\u201d the challenged regulations.

City of Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656, 668 \n(1993), standing rested on petitioner\u2019s allegation that \nits members \u201cregularly bid on construction contracts\u201d \nand \u201cwould have bid on contracts\u201d unavailable to them \ndue to the challenged program \u201cwere they so able.\u201d  Be-\ncause those allegations \u201cha[d] not been challenged,\u201d \nthe Court \u201cassum[ed] that they [were] true.\u201d  Id. at \n668-669.17   \n \nat *27 n.14 (July 15, 1996); see also id. at *8; Bennett v. Plenert, \n1993 WL 669429, at *3 (D. Or. Nov. 18, 1993). \n17 Because of the nature of the equal protection right at issue in \nNortheastern Florida, the companies did not need to show that \nthird parties would have selected their bids\u2014just that the com-\npanies were unable to compete on an equal basis.  See, e.g., Gratz \nv. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 244, 262 (2003). \n\n \n31 \n \nNone of those cases supports a categorical rule ex-\ncusing anyone who sells a product from the obligation \nto establish redressability when challenging a regula-\ntion implicating the use of that product.  And the pos-\nture of cases like Bennett and CBS only underscores \nthe deficiency of petitioners\u2019 showing here.  The peti-\ntioners in those cases sought to survive a motion to \ndismiss, and therefore had the \u201crelatively modest\u201d \nburden of advancing \u201c\u2018general factual allegations\u2019\u201d on \nthe elements of standing.  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 168, \n171; see CBS, 316 U.S. at 414, 423; cf. Ne. Fla., 508 \nU.S. at 668-669.  Here, petitioners were seeking to ob-\ntain a final judgment.  So they needed to \u201c\u2018set forth\u2019 by \naffidavit or other evidence \u2018specific facts\u2019\u201d demonstrat-\ning that vacatur would likely redress their injury.  \nBennett, 520 U.S. at 168; see Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.  \nNo amount of after-the-fact theorizing can excuse \ntheir failure to do so.   \nFor similar reasons, Energy Future Coalition v. \nEPA, 793 F.3d 141 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (Kavanaugh, J.), \ndoes not establish standing here.  That case involved \nethanol producers who sought to challenge an EPA \nregulation prohibiting automakers from using fuel \ncontaining 30% ethanol when testing new vehicles.  Id. \nat 143-144.  The court of appeals observed that stand-\ning can be shown where judicial relief \u201cwould remove \na regulatory hurdle\u201d to the use of a petitioner\u2019s prod-\nuct.  Id. at 144; see Pet. Br. 4, 13, 28, 29, 36.  But that \nwas the starting point for the court\u2019s analysis\u2014not the \nfinish line.  Unlike the petitioners here, the challeng-\ners in Energy Future submitted a detailed standing \nanalysis, which included an economist\u2019s explanation of \nhow the regulated parties would react to the sought-\n\n \n32 \n \nafter change.18  The court was therefore able to focus \non actual record evidence establishing \u201csubstantial \nreason to think that at least some vehicle manufactur-\ners would use\u201d the fuel in testing if the challenged reg-\nulation were eliminated.  Energy Future, 793 F.3d at \n144; see also id. at 144 (describing comments from \nFord Motor Company).  And the court expressly dis-\ntinguished the case before it from a case (like this one) \nin which studies and other \u201cobjective evidence directly \nundermined petitioners\u2019 theory of standing.\u201d  Id. at \n145 n.2. \n2. Petitioners\u2019 rule would violate basic \nprinciples of Article III standing \nThat focus on the particular circumstances of the \ncase, and the allegations and evidence before the \ncourt, is compelled by core requirements of Article III. \na.  Federal courts may not exercise jurisdiction \nbased on assumptions or speculation.  See, e.g., Clap-\nper, 568 U.S. at 414; Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better \nEnv\u2019t, 523 U.S. 83, 94 (1998).  After the pleading stage, \nthey must assure themselves that standing exists by \nexamining \u201c\u2018specific facts\u2019\u201d and \u201cevidence\u201d introduced \nby the plaintiff.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561; see All. for \nHippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 384 (noting the \u201cheavily \nfact-dependent\u201d nature of the inquiry).  That obliga-\ntion takes on added significance when the circum-\nstances of a case (or evidence submitted by the \nopposing party) create serious doubts about one of the \nelements of standing.  See generally Hertz Corp., 559 \nU.S. at 96-97. \n \n18 See Pet. Br., Energy Future, No. 14-1123, 2014 WL 5035232, at \n*29-41 (D.C. Cir. Oct. 8, 2014). \n\n \n33 \n \nTo be sure, \u201cthe nature and extent of facts that \nmust be\u201d submitted by a party seeking to challenge \ngovernment action \u201cdepends considerably\u201d on the sur-\nrounding circumstances.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.  A \nplaintiff who is directly regulated by the challenged \naction, for example, may only need to submit evidence \nshowing that it is an object of that regulation, and that \nit would engage in activities proscribed by the regula-\ntion if it were allowed to do so.  Supra p. 16.  Similarly, \nif the action prohibits other companies from using the \nplaintiff\u2019s product, causation and redressability may \nfollow from basic evidence that the plaintiff sells the \nproduct and third-party companies would have used it \nabsent the regulation.  See, e.g., Energy Future, 793 \nF.3d at 144. \nBut observations about the ease of satisfying evi-\ndentiary requirements in certain types of cases do not \namount to a categorical legal rule that \u201csuffices to es-\ntablish redressability\u201d absent evidence.  Pet. Br. 17.  \nAs this Court has explained, presumptions run \nagainst jurisdiction\u2014not in favor of it.  See, e.g., Renne \nv. Geary, 501 U.S. 312, 316 (1991) (\u201cWe presume that \nfederal courts lack jurisdiction unless the contrary ap-\npears affirmatively from the record.\u201d (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted)); see also Kokkonen, 511 U.S. at \n377.   \nA court must therefore examine the facts and evi-\ndence to determine whether\u2014\u201cin reality\u201d\u2014a judgment \naddressing a challenged government action would \nlikely redress a plaintiff\u2019s asserted injury.  Bennett, \n520 U.S. at 169.  For example, if a regulation makes it \nunlawful \u201cfor soda manufacturers to use sugar,\u201d En-\nergy Future, 793 F.3d at 144, a plaintiff may establish \nstanding by pointing to the regulation and introducing \n\n \n34 \n \nevidence that it sells sugar and that some sodas con-\ntain sugar.  But not every case will be that \u201csimple\u201d \n(Pet. Br. 47).  If the regulation instead made it unlaw-\nful only for soda manufacturers to sell more than 80% \nof their beverages with sugar, and the administrative \nrecord established that sugar-free sodas already rep-\nresented 30% of the market before the regulation, that \nplaintiff would have to do more to establish redressa-\nbility. \nAs discussed above, petitioners\u2019 case does not re-\nsemble the \u201csimple\u201d scenarios, primarily because no \none challenged EPA\u2019s initial decision to grant a waiver \nin 2013.  In the ensuing decade, automakers made \nenormous investments in zero-emission vehicles and \nconsumer tastes evolved.  By May 2022, it was not at \nall clear that the presence or absence of the Advanced \nClean Cars I standards would have a determinative or \ncoercive effect on the mix of cars sold by automakers.  \nSee supra pp. 20-22.  Market forces and internal goals \nwere pushing automakers to continue their shift to-\nward electric vehicles, regardless of California\u2019s regu-\nlations.  Pet. App. 24a n.8.  Those circumstances \ndemanded actual evidence showing redressability\u2014\nnot unsupported assertions about \u201ccommon sense and \nbasic economics.\u201d  Pet. Br. 30. \nb.  Petitioners\u2019 contrary arguments demonstrate a \nmisunderstanding of this Court\u2019s precedent.  It is true \n(Pet. Br. 27) that redressability involves \u201cthe relation-\nship between \u2018the judicial relief requested\u2019 and the \u2018in-\njury\u2019 suffered.\u201d  California v. Texas, 593 U.S. 659, 671 \n(2021).  But the necessary relationship is lacking \nwhere the plaintiff fails to prove that \u201cdepress[ed] \nmarket demand\u201d for its product in fact \u201cflows from\u201d \n(Pet. Br. 27) the challenged regulation, and that vaca-\ntur would likely lead to increased demand. \n\n \n35 \n \nPetitioners also contend that, \u201c[a]s far as redressa-\nbility is concerned, . . . Article III\u2019s demands are the \nsame whether the plaintiff is directly or indirectly reg-\nulated.\u201d  Pet. Br. 27.  Justice Scalia long ago rejected \nthat notion in an opinion for the Court.  When a plain-\ntiff is not the direct object of the government action it \nchallenges, \u201cstanding is not precluded, but it is ordi-\nnarily \u2018substantially more difficult\u2019 to establish.\u201d  \nLujan, 504 U.S. at 562.  That is because the plaintiff \nmust \u201cadduce facts\u201d creating a likelihood that the \nthird parties who are directly regulated will make \n\u201cchoices . . . in such manner as to produce causation \nand permit redressability of injury.\u201d  Id.  Petitioners \ndid not do so here. \n3. Petitioners\u2019 policy arguments do not \njustify their rule \nPetitioners eventually resort to a series of \u201cpolicy\u201d \narguments.  Pet. Br. 41; see id. at 41-45.  They first \nargue that the decision below effectively \u201crequire[s] \nthe endorsement of a directly regulated third party be-\nfore an indirectly regulated party can sue.\u201d  Id. at 38.  \nThat would be a problem, they contend, because di-\nrectly regulated entities often will be unwilling or un-\nable to assist indirectly affected challengers.  See id. \nat 42.  But the court of appeals did not require peti-\ntioners to \u201cprovid[e] affidavits from automakers\u201d as a \ncondition of standing.  Id. at 38.  The court\u2019s opinion \nshowed a willingness to consider a variety of other ma-\nterials (if identified by the parties), including com-\nments in the administrative record and public \nstatements from industry participants.  See Pet. App. \n23a-24a, 28a.   \nAnd there are a range of evidentiary sources be-\nyond \u201caffidavits from automakers\u201d that bear on how \nautomakers would likely respond to a vacatur in 2022.  \n\n \n36 \n \nThe state respondents gathered facts relevant to \nstanding from public databases, news articles, securi-\nties and court filings, government reports, and corpo-\nrate announcements.  See, e.g., J.A. 190-206.  Just a \nfew days after the oral argument caused petitioners to \ntake the jurisdictional questions seriously, petitioners \nlocated retired auto executives to file supplemental \ndeclarations that purported to speak authoritatively \nabout automakers\u2019 capabilities and practices.  See J.A. \n213, 218.19  In similar contexts, other litigants have \nrelied on a variety of sources.  See, e.g., C.A. Ohio Br. \nAdd. 37-54 (economist\u2019s declaration); Duke Pwr. Co. v. \nCarolina Envt\u2019l Study Grp., Inc., 438 U.S. 59, 75-76 \n(1978) (congressional testimony); Competitive Enter. \nInst. v. FCC, 970 F.3d 372, 383 (D.C. Cir. 2020) (ex-\npert\u2019s analysis); Competitive Enter. Inst. v. NHTSA, \n901 F.2d 107, 117 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (testimony from ad-\nministrative hearing).   \nThe decision below thus does not \u201ccreat[e] artifi-\ncially high evidentiary barriers.\u201d  Pet. Br. 35.  And it \ndoes not obstruct \u201csuits by unregulated plaintiffs who \nare adversely affected by an agency\u2019s regulation of oth-\ners.\u201d  Corner Post, Inc. v. Bd. of Governors of Fed. Rsrv. \nSys., 603 U.S. 799, 826 (2024) (Kavanaugh, J., concur-\nring).  It simply ensures that any such suits are \n \n19 Those declarations are not before this Court because the court \nof appeals held that petitioners failed to establish good cause for \ntheir untimely filing, see Pet. App. 31a-32a, and petitioners did \nnot seek review of that ruling, see Pet. I; State Opp. 14-15.  In any \nevent, the declarants did not account for 2022 market conditions.  \nSee J.A. 213-222.  As to redressability, they merely asserted that \nautomakers \u201clikely would change their production, pricing, \nand/or distribution plans for Model Year 2025\u201d absent Califor-\nnia\u2019s standards.  J.A. 215, 220.  They offered no supporting de-\ntails, and focused instead on the distinct question of how quickly \nautomakers could change their fleets and prices. \n\n \n37 \n \nbrought by plaintiffs who are, in fact, adversely af-\nfected by the challenged action and would benefit from \na favorable decision.     \nNext, petitioners argue that the \u201cdecision below \ncreates troubling incentives for agencies.\u201d  Pet. Br. 43.  \nThey assert that agencies may now \u201ctarget entire in-\ndustries with crippling burdens so long as they act \nthrough a conduit and placate that conduit.\u201d  Id.20  \nAgain, however, a plaintiff whose sales are crippled as \nthe result of an agency action can invoke numerous \nsources to demonstrate a likelihood that vacatur \nwould increase sales.  Nor does this case present any \nvalid concern about \u201cencourag[ing] agencies to act over \nshorter time horizons.\u201d  Pet. Br. 44.  The underlying \nwaiver was granted in 2013 and addressed standards \nthat increased in stringency through model year 2025.  \nAny jurisdictional difficulties petitioners confronted \nresulted primarily from their own choice not to chal-\nlenge the original 2013 action.  See supra p. 18 n.7. \nFinally, petitioners argue that the court of appeals \n\u201ccreate[d] a one-way ratchet in favor of the regulator \nover the regulated\u201d by requiring petitioners to intro-\nduce evidence of standing.  Pet. Br. 44.  They contrast \nthat requirement with the principle that \u201c[a] State will \n \n20 Petitioners note that several automakers entered voluntary \nagreements with California in 2020 to continue producing more \nlow- and zero-emission vehicles.  See Pet. App. 13a-14a.  But that \nwas not a \u201ctroubling\u201d effort by EPA to \u201cinsulate\u201d the \u201centire in-\ndustr[y]\u201d from \u201creview.\u201d  Pet. Br. 43.  And petitioners \nacknowledge that \u201cmany\u201d other automakers did not enter any \nsuch agreement.  Id. at 37.  Nothing prevented petitioners from \nattempting to introduce evidence showing that the non-partici-\npating automakers would likely change their fleets in response to \na vacatur of the reinstatement. \n\n \n38 \n \nalways have \u2018a legitimate interest in the continued en-\nforceability of its own statutes.\u2019\u201d  Id. (quoting Maine v. \nTaylor, 477 U.S. 131, 137 (1986)).  But state plaintiffs \ndo introduce evidence where necessary to show that a \nfavorable judgment would redress their injuries.  See, \ne.g., Dep\u2019t of Com., 588 U.S. at 767-768.  And this \nCourt\u2019s recognition that sovereigns have a protectable \ninterest in effectuating their own statutes hardly \namounts to \u201cbad policy.\u201d  Pet. Br. 41; see Maryland v. \nKing, 567 U.S. 1301, 1303 (2012) (Roberts, C.J., in \nchambers); Maine, 477 U.S. at 137. \nThe more relevant policy consideration is the one \nunderlying Article III:  that federal courts have lim-\nited jurisdiction, and a party seeking to invoke that \njurisdiction must show that its claim falls within those \nlimits.  That policy, which reflects the Framers\u2019 vision \nof the proper role of courts in our democratic system, \nsee All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 380, requires \naffirmance here.   \nB. Unsupported Predictions About the Effect \nof a Judgment on a Third Party Are Insuf-\nficient to Establish Redressability \nPetitioners\u2019 alternative theory for why they did not \nneed to introduce evidence of redressability fails for \nsimilar reasons.  They contend that plaintiffs can es-\ntablish standing simply by asserting that the \u201ceffects \nof the challenged government action on third parties\u201d \nare \u201cpredictable\u201d\u2014and that \u201cno more is needed.\u201d  Pet. \nBr. 18.  The cases petitioners invoke for that argument \nactually demonstrate the opposite.   \nPetitioners portray Department of Commerce as \nholding that unsupported inferences and predictions \nabout \u201cthird-party behavior . . . can suffice\u201d to estab-\nlish standing.  Pet. Br. 30; see id. at 31.  In truth, that \ndecision examined whether the plaintiffs \u201cha[d] met \n\n \n39 \n \ntheir burden of showing that third parties will likely \nreact in predictable ways\u201d to a citizenship question on \nthe 2020 census, and thereby cause harm to the plain-\ntiffs.  Dep\u2019t of Com., 588 U.S. at 768 (emphasis added).  \nThe Court answered that question in the affirmative \nonly after reviewing the district court\u2019s \u201cfindings of \nfact\u201d\u2014based on extensive \u201cevidence\u201d\u2014which \u201cestab-\nlished a sufficient likelihood that the reinstatement of \na citizenship question\u201d would depress census response \nrates.  Id. at 767; see New York v. Dep\u2019t of Com., 351 F. \nSupp. 3d 502, 578-581 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (describing ex-\npert testimony, statistical data, and agency memo-\nranda).  The Court did not rely on \u201cspeculation\u201d or \npredictions alone.  Dep\u2019t of Com., 588 U.S. at 768.21 \nNor can petitioners dismiss the significance of the \nevidence before the Court in Department of Commerce \non the ground that it merely recounted \u201chistorical \npractice.\u201d  Pet. Br. 31.  The plaintiffs in that case did \nnot just reference the result of questions on prior cen-\nsuses.  They introduced detailed evidence that \u201cover-\nwhelmingly support[ed] the conclusion that the \naddition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census \nwill cause a significant net differential decline in self-\nresponse rates among noncitizen households.\u201d  New \nYork, 351 F. Supp. 3d at 578 (emphasis added). \nThe remaining authorities discussed by petitioners \n(Pet. Br. 31) do not advance their theory either.  The \nstanding analysis in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. \n497, 526 (2007), turned on evidence that included \u201cpe-\ntitioners\u2019 uncontested affidavits.\u201d  That evidence \n \n21 See also California, 593 U.S. at 678 (explaining that the plain-\ntiffs in Department of Commerce \u201crelied not only on \u2018the predict-\nable effect of Government action on the decisions of third parties\u2019 \nbut also on comprehensive studies, rather than mere \u2018specula-\ntion\u2019\u201d). \n\n \n40 \n \nshowed that \u201cthe United States transportation sector \nemit[ted] . . .  more than 6% of worldwide carbon diox-\nide emissions,\u201d id. at 524; that there was \u201ca causal con-\nnection between manmade greenhouse gas emissions \nand global warming,\u201d id. at 523, see id. at 525; and \nthat \u201c[a] reduction in domestic emissions\u201d resulting \nfrom the requested relief \u201cwould slow the pace of \nglobal emissions increases,\u201d providing partial redress \nfor petitioners\u2019 undisputed injuries, id. at 526; see id. \nat 522-523.22  In Skyline Wesleyan Church v. Califor-\nnia Department of Managed Health Care, 968 F.3d \n738, 750 (9th Cir. 2020), the plaintiff similarly offered \n\u201cevidence\u201d that regulatory enforcement had caused \nhealth insurers to abandon restrictions on abortion \ncoverage.  Specifically, \u201cseven insurers had offered \nplans with abortion coverage restrictions\u201d consistent \nwith plaintiff\u2019s religious beliefs, then \u201call seven com-\nplied\u201d with a regulator\u2019s warning to stop offering such \nplans.  Id. at 750.  Both decisions thus turned on ac-\ntual evidence, not unsupported predictions. \nPetitioners nonetheless advance a blanket rule \nthat no evidence is required if \u201cthe behavior of third \nparties is predictable rather than speculative.\u201d  Pet. \nBr. 30.  They further contend that only \u201cthree \ncircumstances\u201d exist in which third-party behavior is \nsufficiently speculative to require evidence of redress-\nability:  (i) where a plaintiff\u2019s theory relies on \u201c\u2018coun-\nterintuitive\u2019 assumptions,\u201d  id. at 32 (citing California, \n593 U.S. at 678); (ii) where it relies on an attenuated \n\u201cchain of events,\u201d Pet. Br. 32 (citing All. for Hippo-\ncratic Med., 602 U.S. at 386); and (iii) where the \u201clegal \nimpact of a judicial decision is unclear,\u201d Pet. Br. 33 \n \n22 The Court also accorded a \u201cspecial solicitude\u201d to the state peti-\ntioners, which does not apply to the private petitioners here.  \nMassachusetts, 549 U.S. at 520. \n\n \n41 \n \n(citing Murthy, 603 U.S. at 72-73, Brackeen, 599 U.S. \nat 294, and Texas, 599 U.S. at 691 (Gorsuch, J., con-\ncurring in the judgment)). \nThose arguments profoundly misunderstand this \nCourt\u2019s standing doctrine.  Challengers must always \nidentify \u201cevidence\u201d proving \u201c\u2018specific facts\u2019\u201d that estab-\nlish standing.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561; see FW/PBS, \nInc. v. City of Dallas, 493 U.S. 215, 231 (1990).  And \nthis Court\u2019s analysis of standing is \u201cnot a \u2018mechanical \nexercise\u2019\u201d\u2014particularly when it comes to suits (like \nthis one) \u201cby unregulated parties against the govern-\nment.\u201d  All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 384.  In \nsome cases, \u201cfamiliar circumstances\u201d make standing \n\u201clikely,\u201d id., and a plaintiff might be able to meet its \nburden with less evidence.  In other cases, like those \nreferenced by petitioners, the Court has pointed to cir-\ncumstances calling for \u201cfar stronger evidence\u201d of cau-\nsation and redressability.  E.g., California, 593 U.S. at \n678.  But those circumstances are not the only ones in \nwhich plaintiffs are required to introduce any evi-\ndence.  \nPetitioners\u2019 own arguments illustrate the folly of \ntheir proposed rule.  Invoking Summers v. Earth Is-\nland Institute, 555 U.S. 488, 494 (2009), petitioners ar-\ngue (Pet. Br. 34) that \u201cit is predictable that when the \ngovernment \u2018regulates parks, national forests, or bod-\nies of water,\u2019 it will affect the users of those natural \nresources.\u201d  \u201cIn all such cases,\u201d id., petitioners assert, \nno \u201c[r]ecord evidence is required,\u201d id. at 30.  But Sum-\nmers held exactly the opposite.  It reiterated that a \nplaintiff \u201cbears the burden of showing that he has \nstanding.\u201d  Summers, 555 U.S. at 493.  The Court in-\nsisted on particular evidence showing that the chal-\nlenged regulations would affect a specific site that at \nleast one of plaintiffs\u2019 members had \u201ca specific and \n\n \n42 \n \nconcrete plan\u201d to visit.  Id. at 495.  And it rejected a \n\u201chitherto unheard-of test\u201d that would premise stand-\ning on a \u201cprobability\u201d that \u201csome (unidentified) mem-\nbers have planned to visit some (unidentified) small \nparcels affected by the Forest Service\u2019s procedures and \nwill suffer (unidentified) concrete harm as a result.\u201d  \nId. at 497-498.  That sort of predictive approach\u2014un-\nsupported by concrete evidence\u2014would \u201cmake a mock-\nery of\u201d the Court\u2019s \u201cprior cases.\u201d  Id. at 498. \nC. The Duration of the Waiver Does Not, By \nItself, Establish Standing \nPetitioners also contend that they were excused \nfrom submitting evidence because the \u201cwaiver for cer-\ntain California standards does not sunset.\u201d  Pet. Br. \n19.  But the fact that the greenhouse-gas standards \nplateau starting in model year 2025, and continue at \nthe same levels in future years, supra p. 6, does not \nchange the analysis.   \n1.  Petitioners reason that because those standards \n\u201cdo not expire,\u201d a judicial vacatur \u201cwould necessarily \nhave some effect on vehicle pricing, production, or dis-\ntribution at some future point.\u201d  Pet. Br. 46 (emphasis \nadded).  This Court has previously rejected that kind \nof reasoning.  See Summers, 555 U.S. at 496 (state-\nments of \u201c\u2018some day\u2019 intentions,\u201d without \u201cany specifi-\ncation of when the some day will be,\u201d are insufficient \nto establish standing); Lujan, 504 U.S. at 564 (same).  \nAnd for good reason.  Statutes and regulations often \ndo not sunset.  The mere longevity of a challenged reg-\nulation is no substitute for \u201cspecific, concrete facts \ndemonstrating that\u201d the plaintiff is harmed by the \ngovernment\u2019s action and \u201cpersonally would benefit in \na tangible way from the court\u2019s intervention.\u201d  Warth, \n422 U.S. at 508. \n\n \n43 \n \nIn this case, moreover, the facts belie petitioners\u2019 \nassertion (Pet. Br. 19) that the duration of the green-\nhouse-gas standards eliminates any \u201cplausible dis-\npute\u201d about redressability.  By the time of this suit, \nsales of battery-electric vehicles far exceeded original \nforecasts, and those vehicles generate an outsized \nnumber of ZEV credits and produce very few green-\nhouse-gas emissions.  See supra pp. 6, 21-22.  Petition-\ners did not submit any evidence that the market would \nreverse course if those standards were no longer in \nplace in future years.  See supra p. 25. \nNor does the court of appeals\u2019 apparent misunder-\nstanding about the temporal scope of the greenhouse-\ngas standards (Pet. Br. 45) compel a different outcome.  \nThe court of appeals lacked jurisdiction because peti-\ntioners failed to introduce evidence showing that au-\ntomakers would likely respond to vacatur by \u201cselling \nfewer non-conventional vehicles or by altering the \nprices of their vehicles such that fewer non-conven-\ntional vehicles\u2014and more conventional vehicles\u2014\nwere sold.\u201d  Pet. App. 22a; see id. at 29a-30a.  The \ncourt\u2019s belief that the challenge before it \u201cconcern[ed] \nonly\u201d the reinstatement of the waiver \u201cas to Model \nYears 2017 through 2025,\u201d was a consideration that \n\u201cfurther complicated\u201d the redressability analysis.  Id. \nat 22a (emphasis added); see id. at 24a.  Setting aside \nthat additional perceived complication does not make \nup for petitioners\u2019 failure to introduce any evidence ad-\ndressing how automakers would likely respond to a \nvacatur in May 2022.  See U.S. Opp. 12-14. \n2.  Relatedly, petitioners fault EPA and the court \nof appeals for the court\u2019s \u201cincorrect\u201d premise about the \nduration of the waiver, Pet. Br. 45, which they contend \ncaused the court to improperly \u201cconflate[] mootness \n\n \n44 \n \nand redressability,\u201d id. at 39.  Those arguments are \npuzzling. \nIt has never been a secret that California\u2019s \u201cgreen-\nhouse-gas emission standards applied to model year \n2025 \u2018and subsequent.\u2019\u201d  Pet. Br. 45-46 (quoting J.A. \n50).  That was plainly described in the California Code \nof Regulations. See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \n\u00a7 1961.3(a)(1)(A); see also Cal. Code Regs., tit. 13, \n\u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2012) (similar wording in originally \nenacted ZEV provision).  Petitioners imply that the \nlower court\u2019s confusion about the duration of the \nwaiver arose because EPA failed to \u201ccandidly ex-\nplain[]\u201d the matter until the certiorari stage.  Pet. Br. \n45; see id. at 46.  But the more likely culprit was peti-\ntioners\u2019 opening brief below, which told the court that \npetitioners were challenging a program \u201ccover[ing] ve-\nhicles from model years 2015 through 2025.\u201d  C.A. Pri-\nvate Pet. Br. 9; see also C.A. Oral Arg. 33:55-34:13 \n(argument of petitioners\u2019 counsel that, to defeat stand-\ning, \u201cthe Government would need to come forward \nwith some evidence that [automakers have] now \nplanned around the restatement in a way that couldn\u2019t \nbe withdrawn by 2025\u201d). \nThe lack of clarity on this point was perhaps un-\nderstandable:  petitioners\u2019 central focus in this case \nhas always been on the ZEV standards, which will ex-\npire after model year 2025.  Pet. Br. 46.  That may be \nwhy petitioners urged this Court to resolve the merits \nof their statutory claim before \u201cCalifornia\u2019s waiver ex-\npires at the end of model year 2025,\u201d Pet. 26, even af-\nter they had belatedly acknowledged that the \ngreenhouse-gas standards apply to \u201cModel Years \n\u20182025 and subsequent,\u2019\u201d C.A. Private Pet. Proposed \nSupp. Br. 5.  But whatever the source of the confusion \n\n \n45 \n \nbelow, it did not matter to the ultimate outcome.  Re-\ngardless of the waiver\u2019s duration, petitioners failed to \nshow that automakers would respond to its reinstate-\nment (either sooner or later) by making changes that \nwould increase fuel sales.   \nIn the face of that failure, the court of appeals cor-\nrectly explained why its decision was based on stand-\ning, not mootness:  The jurisdictional problem was not \nthat petitioners\u2019 \u201cstanding arguments were sufficient \nwhen originally filed\u201d and then were \u201cmooted by the \npassage of time.\u201d  Pet. App. 25a; see generally Already, \nLLC v. Nike, Inc., 568 U.S. 85, 91 (2013).  Petitioners\u2019 \n\u201cstanding arguments were deficient from the start.\u201d  \nPet. App. 25a.  By the time petitioners filed their chal-\nlenge in May 2022, shifts in consumer demand and \nother transformations in the market made it specula-\ntive (at best) that vacating the reinstatement would \nlead to increased fuel sales in the future.  Petitioners \nnever even attempted to introduce evidence demon-\nstrating that vacatur of the reinstatement would have \nthe effects on automakers that they predicted.  Pet. \nApp. 29a-30a.   \nD. Petitioners\u2019 Post Hoc Attempts to Identify \nEvidence on Redressability Fail to Estab-\nlish Standing \nFinally, petitioners argue that if they \u201cwere legally \nrequired to produce record evidence to support re-\ndressability, plenty such evidence existed.\u201d  Pet. \nBr. 37.  But the few documents that petitioners cited \nin the court of appeals did not establish any likelihood \nthat a vacatur in 2022 would increase fuel sales, as \ndetailed in Part I.C above.  And the additional materi-\nals petitioners now point this Court to would not have \nestablished redressability even if petitioners had in-\nvoked them in a timely fashion below. \n\n \n46 \n \nPetitioners first highlight (Pet. Br. 38) a statement \nfrom an appendix to California\u2019s 2021 comment letter \nregarding the reinstatement.  See J.A. 84.  But that \nstatement relied on forecasts from 2017.  See J.A. 85 \nn.17 (citing January 2017 analysis of regulation com-\npliance scenarios); id. at 85 n.18 (citing February 2017 \nmodeling scenario).  By 2022, the earlier projections \nhad been overtaken by actual events.  See J.A. 191 (na-\ntional market share of zero-emission vehicles \u201calmost \ntripled\u201d in the period \u201cbetween 2020 and the third \nquarter of 2022\u201d). \nPetitioners also invoke declarations that the state \nrespondents filed along with their motion to intervene, \nshortly after petitioners initiated this suit.  See Pet. \nBr. 13, 34.  Those declarations (like petitioners\u2019) as-\nserted a conclusory \u201cexpect[ation]\u201d that additional \ngasoline-fueled vehicles would be sold if California\u2019s \nstandards were not in place.  J.A. 110, 111; see id. at \n115-116.  The lack of any details or contemporaneous \nevidence for those assertions reflected both time con-\nstraints (the intervention declarations were signed \nfour days after the case commenced) and the reality \nthat the States\u2019 standing and entitlement to intervene \nwere independently established for other reasons.  Cf. \nKing, 567 U.S. at 1303 (reasoning that a State suffers \n\u201congoing irreparable harm\u201d any time it \u201cis enjoined by \na court from effectuating . . . a duly enacted statute\u201d). \nAnother document referenced by petitioners (Pet. \nBr. 47) is outside the record and post-dates the deci-\nsion below:  EPA\u2019s recent request for public comment \non its proposal to incorporate the greenhouse-gas \nstandards of the Advanced Clean Cars I program into \nCalifornia\u2019s state implementation plan.  See 89 Fed. \nReg. 82,553 (Oct. 11, 2024); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7407.  To be \nsure, the underlying state estimates referenced in that \n\n \n47 \n \nproposal (see 89 Fed. Reg. at 82,557 & nn.19-20) are \npart of the record, because California submitted them \nto EPA in 2021 in connection with the reinstatement \nproceedings.  See C.A. J.A. 276.  But petitioners never \ninvoked those submissions below.  And the estimates \ntook as their baseline a projection of zero-emission ve-\nhicle penetration based on 2019 data, which did not \nanticipate the dramatic increase in sales in the follow-\ning years.23   \nNone of the materials that petitioners belatedly \nreference could have satisfied their burden to submit \nevidence about how the market would respond to va-\ncatur of the reinstatement in May 2022.  And the fact \nthat they were not \u201cset forth\u201d as \u201cthe basis for the \nclaim of standing\u201d below poses another insuperable \nobstacle for petitioners.  D.C. Cir. R. 28(a)(7).  As this \nCourt recently reminded litigants, \u201c\u2018judges are not like \npigs, hunting for truffles buried in the record.\u2019\u201d  \nMurthy, 603 U.S. at 67 n.7 (alterations omitted).  The \ncourt of appeals could not reasonably be expected to \nfocus on a few sentences scattered across thousands of \npages of record materials, which were never raised in \npetitioners\u2019 briefs.  Nor could it be expected to recall \nisolated assertions in two declarations, filed in support \nof one of five unopposed motions to intervene, that \nwere disposed of by the Clerk more than a year before \noral argument.  See C.A. Order (June 30, 2022). \nIn the end, petitioners are right that this case is \n\u201csimple\u201d (Pet. Br. 47)\u2014but not in the way they sug-\ngest.  They had the burden to introduce evidence es-\ntablishing that their claim was redressable.  Instead \n \n23  See C.A. J.A. 277 (explaining reliance on \u201cEMFAC 2021\u201d \nmodel); Cal. Air Res. Bd., EMFAC 2021 Volume III Technical \nDocument, at 6 (April 2021), https://tinyurl.com/2wsxz4uy (ex-\nplaining use of DMV data through 2019). \n\n \n48 \n \nof meeting that obligation head-on, they treated re-\ndressability as an afterthought\u2014relying on assump-\ntions and conclusory assertions, supplemented only by \noutdated projections.  And when confronted with cur-\nrent evidence from the state respondents undermining \ntheir assumption that vacatur of the reinstatement in \nMay 2022 would lead to increased fuel sales, petition-\ners offered no evidentiary response.  Because petition-\ners failed to introduce specific facts and evidence \nestablishing a likelihood of redressability, the court of \nappeals properly held that it could not reach the mer-\nits. \n\n \n49 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be af-\nfirmed. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \nROB BONTA \nAttorney General of California \nMICHAEL J.

The query 'redressability standing predictable effects third parties' directly targets the core of the petitioner's necessary argument: that a favorable ruling would predictably influence automakers (the third parties) to change their production mix, thereby redressing the fuel producers' injury. Searching the petitioner's brief is the most direct way to find their specific legal theory and the precedents they rely on, which is essential for predicting the outcome. The design EIG is also significant because this action represents a sophisticated and generalizable strategy: after identifying the dispositive issue from a lower court opinion (here, redressability), the agent drills down into the petitioner's primary brief to find their counter-argument. This is a key step in moving from factual summary to focused legal analysis.",

U.S. Bank N.A., \n590 U.S. 538, 547 (2020).  Article III standing should \nnot be complicated here.  The question is whether a \nparty has standing to challenge a government action \nthat works by depressing the market for that party\u2019s \nproducts.  To ask the question is to answer it.  Private \nschools have standing to challenge a law prohibiting \nparents from sending their children to private school.  \nPublishers have standing to challenge a law banning \nbookstores from selling their books.  And here, produc-\ners and sellers of liquid fuels have standing to chal-\nlenge a rule requiring automakers to make cars that \nuse less liquid fuel, or none at all. \n\n2 \n \nThis lawsuit arises from the Biden Administration\u2019s \nefforts to force the electrification of the Nation\u2019s vehi-\ncle fleet.  In 2021, President Biden announced his \u201cgoal \nthat 50 percent of all new passenger cars and light \ntrucks sold in 2030 be zero-emission vehicles,\u201d as part \nof his administration\u2019s efforts to \u201caddress the climate \ncrisis.\u201d  86 Fed. Reg. 43,583, 43,583 (Aug. 5, 2021).  At \nthe time, electric vehicles made up around 4% of the \nnew automobile market.  So to fast-forward to the re-\nsult the President wanted\u2014fewer combustion-engine \nvehicles on the road and less liquid fuel consumed\u2014the \nfederal government pursued a multi-pronged strategy \nof federal and state regulation.  \nOn the state front, EPA turned to Section 209 of  \nthe Clean Air Act.  That unique provision broadly \npreempts States from adopting their own motor-vehicle \nemission standards.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(a).  But it per-\nmits California\u2014and California alone\u2014to obtain a nar-\nrow waiver from federal preemption.  Id. \u00a7 7543(b).  To \nreceive a special preemption waiver, California must \ndemonstrate that it \u201cneed[s]\u201d its own emission stand-\nards \u201cto meet compelling and extraordinary condi-\ntions.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7543(b)(1)(B).   \nFor decades, EPA granted Section 209(b) preemp-\ntion waivers to California to address the State\u2019s local \npollution problems, such as smog.  In recent years, \nhowever, different administrations have flip-flopped on \nwhether Section 209(b) permits EPA to grant Califor-\nnia a waiver to tackle global climate change.  Most rel-\nevant here is EPA\u2019s 2022 flip, in which it reinstated a \nonce-granted, once-revoked waiver for California\u2019s \n\u201cAdvanced Clean Cars\u201d program.  That program in-\ncludes a set of stringent greenhouse-gas emission \nstandards, as well as a mandate requiring automakers \nto meet a 22% zero-emission-vehicle target by model \n\n3 \n \nyear 2025.  Pet. App. 55a-57a.  California\u2019s governor \nexplained that the program works \u201cto end our reliance \non fossil fuels.\u201d1  \nPetitioners immediately challenged EPA\u2019s rein-\nstated waiver.  Petitioners are entities (and associa-\ntions of entities) that produce or sell liquid fuels and \nthe raw materials used to make them.  They challenged \nEPA\u2019s approval of California\u2019s standards as incon-\nsistent with the major-questions doctrine and the plain \ntext of Section 209(b), which allows for a special Cali-\nfornia exemption only for problems localized to and \nsolvable in California\u2014not for global issues like cli-\nmate change.  To establish their standing, petitioners \nsubmitted 14 declarations explaining that California\u2019s \nstandards target their products and will result in lower \nsales.  \nThe court of appeals held that petitioners lacked Ar-\nticle III standing.  The court theorized that vacating \nEPA\u2019s waiver, and thus eliminating California\u2019s coer-\ncive regulations, might not have any effect on car man-\nufacturers\u2019 decisions about the composition of their \nfleets, given market demand.  As a result, the court \nconcluded that petitioners had not shown that a favor-\nable decision would redress their economic injuries.  \nPet. App. 29a. \nThat cannot be right.  The entire point of Califor-\nnia\u2019s Advanced Clean Cars program is to reduce de-\nmand for petitioners\u2019 products:  the regulations are de-\nsigned to compel automakers to change the kind of ve-\nhicles they produce so as to decrease the amount of liq-\nuid fuel burned by drivers.  No one disputes that is the \naim of California\u2019s standards.  It is why EPA praised \n \n1 \nGovernor Gavin Newsom, Governor Newsom Statement on \nBiden Administration\u2019s Restoration of California\u2019s Clean Car \nWaiver (Mar. 9, 2022), https://perma.cc/T92E-2XM8. \n\n4 \n \nits waiver as a \u201ccritical step to confront the climate cri-\nsis.\u201d2  Eliminating the waiver and wiping California\u2019s \nAdvanced Clean Cars program off the books would \nthus be likely to remedy at least one dollar of petition-\ners\u2019 economic injuries.  Redressability here should not \nbe more complicated than that. \nThere are three doctrinal paths to that com-\nmonsense conclusion.  First, and most simply, redress-\nability is satisfied because a favorable decision would \n\u201cremove a regulatory hurdle\u201d to the sale of petitioners\u2019 \nproducts.  Energy Future Coal. v. EPA, 793 F.3d 141, \n144 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (Kavanaugh, J.); see Bennett \nv. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 169 (1997).  Second, even absent \nthat categorical rule, challengers to a government ac-\ntion may establish redressability by relying on the ac-\ntion\u2019s \u201cpredictable effect\u201d on third parties.  Depart-\nment of Commerce v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 768 \n(2019).  It is entirely predictable that California\u2019s reg-\nulation of automakers would \u201ccause downstream or up-\nstream economic injuries to others in the chain\u201d\u2014 \nespecially petitioners.  FDA v. Alliance for Hippo-\ncratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 384 (2024).  Third, at a mini-\nmum petitioners\u2019 injuries are redressable because \nEPA has now clarified that its waiver has no expiration \ndate.  Not even the court below doubted that setting \naside a perpetual waiver would likely affect automaker \nbehavior at some point in the future. \nArticle III\u2019s redressability requirement exists to \nalign injuries and remedies, so that litigants do not sue \nthe wrong parties and courts do not issue overly broad \n \n2 \nEPA, News Release:  What They Are Saying:  EPA Restora-\ntion of California Waiver Will Support State Climate Action, Im-\nprove Air Quality, and Advance our Electric Vehicle Future (Mar. \n11, 2022), https://perma.cc/896Q-N2X5 (EPA News Release).  \n\n5 \n \nrelief or advisory opinions.  The redressability require-\nment does not exist to block the intended targets of \ngovernment regulation from challenging the very reg-\nulations that threaten their existence, so that courts \ncan avoid deciding controversial or difficult questions.  \nThis Court should reverse. \nOPINION BELOW \nThe opinion of the court of appeals (Pet. App. \n1a-49a) is reported at 98 F.4th 288.  The EPA order \nunder review (Pet. App. 50a-285a) is available at \n87 Fed. Reg. 14,332. \nJURISDICTION \nThe court of appeals entered judgment on April 9, \n2024.  The petition for a writ of certiorari was filed on \nJuly 2, 2024, and granted on December 13, 2024.  This \nCourt has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nRelevant statutory provisions are reproduced in an \nappendix to this brief. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Statutory Background \n\u201cThe Clean Air Act regulates pollution-generating \nemissions from both stationary sources, such as facto-\nries and powerplants, and moving sources, such as \ncars, trucks, and aircraft.\u201d  Utility Air Regul. Grp.  \nv. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 308 (2014).  This case concerns  \nTitle II of the Act, which authorizes EPA to regulate \nemissions from new motor vehicles.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7521, \n7543.   \nTo effectuate a (mostly) uniform federal emissions \nregime, Section 209(a) of Title II broadly prohibits \nStates from \u201cadopt[ing] or attempt[ing] to enforce any \n\n6 \n \nstandard relating to the control of emissions from new \nmotor vehicles.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(a).  This preemption \nprovision prevents \u201can anarchic patchwork of federal \nand state regulatory programs, a prospect which \nthreatened to create nightmares for the manufactur-\ners.\u201d  Motor Equip. Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 627 F.2d 1095, \n1109 (D.C. Cir. 1979).   \nCongress created one exception to Section 209(a)\u2019s \nbroad preemption of state emission standards:  Section \n209(b), which authorizes EPA to \u201cwaive\u201d preemption \nfor certain standards adopted by California.  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7543(b).3  Congress granted California this special \nstatus because of the State\u2019s \u201cunique problems\u201d with \nsmog and other local issues caused by so-called \u201ccrite-\nria\u201d pollutants like particulate matter.  H.R. Rep. No. \n90-728, at 22 (1967).  In particular, California\u2019s atypical \n\u201cgeography and prevailing wind patterns,\u201d together \nwith its unusually large number of vehicles, made smog \na more persistent problem there than elsewhere.   \n49 Fed. Reg. 18,887, 18,890 (May 3, 1984) (citing  \n113 Cong. Rec. 30,948 (Nov. 2, 1967)). \nCongress limited California\u2019s ability to separately \nregulate emissions in several ways.  The onus is first \non California, which must \u201cdetermine[] that the State \nstandards will be, in the aggregate, at least as protec-\ntive of public health and welfare as applicable Federal \nstandards.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(b)(1).  After the State \nmakes that determination and files an application, \nEPA must deny a waiver if it finds that (1) California\u2019s \n \n3 \nSection 209(b) does not name California.  It instead makes a \npreemption waiver possible for \u201cany State\u201d that had adopted certain \nstandards \u201cprior to March 30, 1966.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(b)(1).  But as \nCongress was aware, California was the only State that met this cri-\nterion and \u201cis thus the only state eligible for a waiver.\u201d  Motor Equip. \nMfrs.

U.S. Bank N.A., \n590 U.S. 538, 547 (2020).  Article III standing should \nnot be complicated here.  The question is whether a \nparty has standing to challenge a government action \nthat works by depressing the market for that party\u2019s \nproducts.  To ask the question is to answer it.  Private \nschools have standing to challenge a law prohibiting \nparents from sending their children to private school.  \nPublishers have standing to challenge a law banning \nbookstores from selling their books.  And here, produc-\ners and sellers of liquid fuels have standing to chal-\nlenge a rule requiring automakers to make cars that \nuse less liquid fuel, or none at all. \n\n2 \n \nThis lawsuit arises from the Biden Administration\u2019s \nefforts to force the electrification of the Nation\u2019s vehi-\ncle fleet.  In 2021, President Biden announced his \u201cgoal \nthat 50 percent of all new passenger cars and light \ntrucks sold in 2030 be zero-emission vehicles,\u201d as part \nof his administration\u2019s efforts to \u201caddress the climate \ncrisis.\u201d  86 Fed. Reg. 43,583, 43,583 (Aug. 5, 2021).  At \nthe time, electric vehicles made up around 4% of the \nnew automobile market.  So to fast-forward to the re-\nsult the President wanted\u2014fewer combustion-engine \nvehicles on the road and less liquid fuel consumed\u2014the \nfederal government pursued a multi-pronged strategy \nof federal and state regulation.  \nOn the state front, EPA turned to Section 209 of  \nthe Clean Air Act.  That unique provision broadly \npreempts States from adopting their own motor-vehicle \nemission standards.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(a).  But it per-\nmits California\u2014and California alone\u2014to obtain a nar-\nrow waiver from federal preemption.  Id. \u00a7 7543(b).  To \nreceive a special preemption waiver, California must \ndemonstrate that it \u201cneed[s]\u201d its own emission stand-\nards \u201cto meet compelling and extraordinary condi-\ntions.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7543(b)(1)(B).   \nFor decades, EPA granted Section 209(b) preemp-\ntion waivers to California to address the State\u2019s local \npollution problems, such as smog.  In recent years, \nhowever, different administrations have flip-flopped on \nwhether Section 209(b) permits EPA to grant Califor-\nnia a waiver to tackle global climate change.  Most rel-\nevant here is EPA\u2019s 2022 flip, in which it reinstated a \nonce-granted, once-revoked waiver for California\u2019s \n\u201cAdvanced Clean Cars\u201d program.  That program in-\ncludes a set of stringent greenhouse-gas emission \nstandards, as well as a mandate requiring automakers \nto meet a 22% zero-emission-vehicle target by model \n\n3 \n \nyear 2025.  Pet. App. 55a-57a.  California\u2019s governor \nexplained that the program works \u201cto end our reliance \non fossil fuels.\u201d1  \nPetitioners immediately challenged EPA\u2019s rein-\nstated waiver.  Petitioners are entities (and associa-\ntions of entities) that produce or sell liquid fuels and \nthe raw materials used to make them.  They challenged \nEPA\u2019s approval of California\u2019s standards as incon-\nsistent with the major-questions doctrine and the plain \ntext of Section 209(b), which allows for a special Cali-\nfornia exemption only for problems localized to and \nsolvable in California\u2014not for global issues like cli-\nmate change.  To establish their standing, petitioners \nsubmitted 14 declarations explaining that California\u2019s \nstandards target their products and will result in lower \nsales.  \nThe court of appeals held that petitioners lacked Ar-\nticle III standing.  The court theorized that vacating \nEPA\u2019s waiver, and thus eliminating California\u2019s coer-\ncive regulations, might not have any effect on car man-\nufacturers\u2019 decisions about the composition of their \nfleets, given market demand.  As a result, the court \nconcluded that petitioners had not shown that a favor-\nable decision would redress their economic injuries.  \nPet. App. 29a. \nThat cannot be right.  The entire point of Califor-\nnia\u2019s Advanced Clean Cars program is to reduce de-\nmand for petitioners\u2019 products:  the regulations are de-\nsigned to compel automakers to change the kind of ve-\nhicles they produce so as to decrease the amount of liq-\nuid fuel burned by drivers.  No one disputes that is the \naim of California\u2019s standards.  It is why EPA praised \n \n1 \nGovernor Gavin Newsom, Governor Newsom Statement on \nBiden Administration\u2019s Restoration of California\u2019s Clean Car \nWaiver (Mar. 9, 2022), https://perma.cc/T92E-2XM8. \n\n4 \n \nits waiver as a \u201ccritical step to confront the climate cri-\nsis.\u201d2  Eliminating the waiver and wiping California\u2019s \nAdvanced Clean Cars program off the books would \nthus be likely to remedy at least one dollar of petition-\ners\u2019 economic injuries.  Redressability here should not \nbe more complicated than that. \nThere are three doctrinal paths to that com-\nmonsense conclusion.  First, and most simply, redress-\nability is satisfied because a favorable decision would \n\u201cremove a regulatory hurdle\u201d to the sale of petitioners\u2019 \nproducts.  Energy Future Coal. v. EPA, 793 F.3d 141, \n144 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (Kavanaugh, J.); see Bennett \nv. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 169 (1997).  Second, even absent \nthat categorical rule, challengers to a government ac-\ntion may establish redressability by relying on the ac-\ntion\u2019s \u201cpredictable effect\u201d on third parties.  Depart-\nment of Commerce v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 768 \n(2019).  It is entirely predictable that California\u2019s reg-\nulation of automakers would \u201ccause downstream or up-\nstream economic injuries to others in the chain\u201d\u2014 \nespecially petitioners.  FDA v. Alliance for Hippo-\ncratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 384 (2024).  Third, at a mini-\nmum petitioners\u2019 injuries are redressable because \nEPA has now clarified that its waiver has no expiration \ndate.  Not even the court below doubted that setting \naside a perpetual waiver would likely affect automaker \nbehavior at some point in the future. \nArticle III\u2019s redressability requirement exists to \nalign injuries and remedies, so that litigants do not sue \nthe wrong parties and courts do not issue overly broad \n \n2 \nEPA, News Release:  What They Are Saying:  EPA Restora-\ntion of California Waiver Will Support State Climate Action, Im-\nprove Air Quality, and Advance our Electric Vehicle Future (Mar. \n11, 2022), https://perma.cc/896Q-N2X5 (EPA News Release).  \n\n5 \n \nrelief or advisory opinions.  The redressability require-\nment does not exist to block the intended targets of \ngovernment regulation from challenging the very reg-\nulations that threaten their existence, so that courts \ncan avoid deciding controversial or difficult questions.  \nThis Court should reverse. \nOPINION BELOW \nThe opinion of the court of appeals (Pet. App. \n1a-49a) is reported at 98 F.4th 288.  The EPA order \nunder review (Pet. App. 50a-285a) is available at \n87 Fed. Reg. 14,332. \nJURISDICTION \nThe court of appeals entered judgment on April 9, \n2024.  The petition for a writ of certiorari was filed on \nJuly 2, 2024, and granted on December 13, 2024.  This \nCourt has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nRelevant statutory provisions are reproduced in an \nappendix to this brief. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Statutory Background \n\u201cThe Clean Air Act regulates pollution-generating \nemissions from both stationary sources, such as facto-\nries and powerplants, and moving sources, such as \ncars, trucks, and aircraft.\u201d  Utility Air Regul. Grp.  \nv. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 308 (2014).  This case concerns  \nTitle II of the Act, which authorizes EPA to regulate \nemissions from new motor vehicles.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7521, \n7543.   \nTo effectuate a (mostly) uniform federal emissions \nregime, Section 209(a) of Title II broadly prohibits \nStates from \u201cadopt[ing] or attempt[ing] to enforce any \n\n6 \n \nstandard relating to the control of emissions from new \nmotor vehicles.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(a).  This preemption \nprovision prevents \u201can anarchic patchwork of federal \nand state regulatory programs, a prospect which \nthreatened to create nightmares for the manufactur-\ners.\u201d  Motor Equip. Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 627 F.2d 1095, \n1109 (D.C. Cir. 1979).   \nCongress created one exception to Section 209(a)\u2019s \nbroad preemption of state emission standards:  Section \n209(b), which authorizes EPA to \u201cwaive\u201d preemption \nfor certain standards adopted by California.  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7543(b).3  Congress granted California this special \nstatus because of the State\u2019s \u201cunique problems\u201d with \nsmog and other local issues caused by so-called \u201ccrite-\nria\u201d pollutants like particulate matter.  H.R. Rep. No. \n90-728, at 22 (1967).  In particular, California\u2019s atypical \n\u201cgeography and prevailing wind patterns,\u201d together \nwith its unusually large number of vehicles, made smog \na more persistent problem there than elsewhere.   \n49 Fed. Reg. 18,887, 18,890 (May 3, 1984) (citing  \n113 Cong. Rec. 30,948 (Nov. 2, 1967)). \nCongress limited California\u2019s ability to separately \nregulate emissions in several ways.  The onus is first \non California, which must \u201cdetermine[] that the State \nstandards will be, in the aggregate, at least as protec-\ntive of public health and welfare as applicable Federal \nstandards.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(b)(1).  After the State \nmakes that determination and files an application, \nEPA must deny a waiver if it finds that (1) California\u2019s \n \n3 \nSection 209(b) does not name California.  It instead makes a \npreemption waiver possible for \u201cany State\u201d that had adopted certain \nstandards \u201cprior to March 30, 1966.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(b)(1).  But as \nCongress was aware, California was the only State that met this cri-\nterion and \u201cis thus the only state eligible for a waiver.\u201d  Motor Equip. \nMfrs. Ass\u2019n, 627 F.2d at 1100 n.1. \n\n7 \n \nprotectiveness determination is \u201carbitrary and capri-\ncious,\u201d id. \u00a7 7543(b)(1)(A); (2) California \u201cdoes not need \nsuch State standards to meet compelling and extraor-\ndinary conditions,\u201d id. \u00a7 7543(b)(1)(B); or (3) the pro-\nposed state standards are inconsistent with federal \nemission standards, id. \u00a7 7543(b)(1)(C). \nIn 1977, ten years after setting up this preemption \nframework, Congress amended the Clean Air Act to al-\nlow other States to follow California.  Any State may \nnow \u201cadopt and enforce\u201d California standards \u201cfor \nwhich a waiver has been granted,\u201d so long as the adopt-\ning State has an approved plan to attain the federal air-\nquality standards for criteria pollutants.  42 U.S.C.  \n\u00a7\u00a7 7507, 7408(a), 7409.  The upshot of this unusual \npreemption system is that EPA sets nationwide emis-\nsion standards; California may in limited circum-\nstances set more stringent ones for itself; and other \nStates may either apply EPA\u2019s standards or adopt Cal-\nifornia\u2019s, but may not set their own. \nB. Regulatory Background \n1. For decades, Section 209(b) worked as Congress \nhad envisioned.  EPA granted California waivers for \nthe State to set emission standards designed to combat \nlocal air-quality problems like smog.  See, e.g., 38 Fed. \nReg. 10,317, 10,318 (Apr. 26, 1973); 59 Fed. Reg. 48,625, \n48,626 (Sept. 22, 1994).  In recent years, however, Cal-\nifornia has sought to transform its unique preemption \nexception into a tool for targeting global climate \nchange.  It has done so through aggressive regulations \nthat limit vehicle greenhouse-gas emissions and force \nelectrification of the State\u2019s (and consequently the Na-\ntion\u2019s) vehicle fleet. \nCalifornia\u2019s efforts initially stalled.  In 2008, under \nPresident George W. Bush, EPA denied California\u2019s \nfirst application for a waiver for climate-change- \n\n8 \n \nfocused regulations.  California sought to impose \nstandards limiting greenhouse-gas emissions from new \nmotor vehicles in the State.  73 Fed. Reg. 12,156, \n12,156-12,157 (Mar. 6, 2008).  EPA rejected California\u2019s \napplication, explaining that Section 209(b)\u2019s preemp-\ntion waiver permitted California to enact standards to \naddress only \u201clocal and regional\u201d pollution where the \n\u201ccausal factors are local to California\u201d\u2014which obvi-\nously did not include global climate change.  Id. at \n12,163. \nThe day after President Obama took office, Califor-\nnia sought reconsideration of EPA\u2019s denial of its waiver \napplication.  EPA granted reconsideration, reversed it-\nself, and issued the waiver.  74 Fed. Reg. 32,744, 32,783 \n(July 8, 2009).  EPA \u201creject[ed]\u201d its prior conclusion \nthat Section 209(b) did not authorize California to \n\u201cpromulgate state standards designed to address \nglobal climate change problems\u201d and approved Califor-\nnia\u2019s first set of greenhouse-gas emission standards.  \nId. at 32,746.  In assessing the \u201cprotectiveness\u201d of Cal-\nifornia\u2019s standards, EPA relied on California\u2019s finding \nthat the standards \u201cwill result in a reduction in up-\nstream emissions (emission due to the production and \ntransportation of the fuel used by the vehicle) of green-\nhouse gas, criteria and toxic pollutants due to reduced \nfuel usage.\u201d  Id. at 32,750 n.36 (emphasis added) (cita-\ntion omitted).   \nA number of affected car dealers challenged EPA\u2019s \nwaiver decision.  Before the D.C. Circuit could rule, \nEPA \u201cpromulgated national greenhouse gas stand-\nards\u201d for model years 2012 through 2016, \u201cand Califor-\nnia amended its regulations to deem compliance with \nthose national standards as compliance with its own.\u201d  \nChamber of Commerce v. EPA, 642 F.3d 192, 206 (D.C. \nCir. 2011).  Pointing to those two developments, the \n\n9 \n \nD.C. Circuit held that the challenge to EPA\u2019s Section \n209(b) waiver was moot.  Ibid.   \n2. This case concerns California\u2019s next greenhouse-\ngas waiver request.  In 2012, California applied for a \nnew waiver to allow it to impose its \u201cAdvanced Clean \nCars\u201d program, which includes stricter standards \naimed at further curbing greenhouse-gas emissions \nfrom vehicles.  The proposed standards govern all new \npassenger cars, light-duty trucks, and medium-duty \npassenger vehicles sold in California for model year \n2015 through at least model year 2025.  California \npraised its Advanced Clean Cars standards as \u201csome of \nthe best tools we have\u201d \u201cto tackle the climate crisis\u201d by \n\u201creduc[ing] emissions\u201d and \u201cdriv[ing] technological in-\nnovation.\u201d  EPA News Release.   \nTwo components of the Advanced Clean Cars pro-\ngram are especially relevant here.  First, the program \nincludes greenhouse-gas emission standards that limit \ncarbon-dioxide emissions across fleets of vehicles.  \nManufacturers meet those limits by producing more \nelectric vehicles or by implementing technologies that \nreduce fuel consumption in combustion-engine vehi-\ncles, such as \u201celectric drive technologies\u201d and \u201cengine \nefficiency improvements.\u201d  78 Fed. Reg. 2,112, 2,136-\n2,137 (Jan. 9, 2013); see Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1961.3.  \nSecond, the program includes a \u201czero-emission vehicle\u201d \nmandate, which requires each car manufacturer to pro-\nduce and deliver for sale in California an increasing \npercentage of battery-electric or fuel-cell vehicles out \nof its overall fleet (or purchase regulatory \u201ccredits\u201d in-\nstead).  Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(b).  This man-\ndate culminates in a requirement that 22% of a manu-\nfacturer\u2019s passenger vehicles produced for model year \n2025, accounting for credits, must be zero-emission  \n\n10 \n \nvehicles\u2014up from 4.5% in model year 2018.4  Id.  \n\u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A).  California explained in its waiver ap-\nplication that the zero-emission-vehicle mandate \u201ccan \ndramatically reduce petroleum consumption . . . com-\npared to conventional technologies.\u201d  J.A. 28 (citation \nomitted). \nIn 2013, EPA granted the waiver, allowing Califor-\nnia \u201cto enforce its [Advanced Clean Cars] emission  \nregulations.\u201d  78 Fed. Reg. at 2,145.  EPA concluded \nthat California\u2019s standards met Section 209(b)\u2019s  \nrequirements\u2014including that they were \u201cneeded to meet \ncompelling and extraordinary conditions\u201d\u2014because \nthe threat of global climate change was itself \u201cextraor-\ndinary.\u201d  Id. at 2,129.  Notably, EPA credited Califor-\nnia\u2019s finding that the cost of its regulations would be \n\u201cmore than offset by consumer fuel savings over the \nlife of the vehicles.\u201d  Id. at 2,138.   \n3. Under the first Trump Administration, EPA re-\nverted to its original approach to Section 209(b).  In a \n2019 joint rulemaking with NHTSA, EPA rescinded the \n2013 preemption waiver for California\u2019s greenhouse-gas \nstandards and zero-emission-vehicle mandate, again \nreasoning that global climate change is not the kind of \n\u201cpeculiar,\u201d California-specific condition covered by \nSection 209(b).  84 Fed. Reg. 51,310, 51,328, 51,342 \n(Sept. 27, 2019).  EPA also found that California did not \n\u201cneed\u201d its standards to \u201cmeet\u201d climate-change condi-\ntions because California\u2019s standards would likely result \n \n4 \nCalifornia\u2019s regulations express this mandate as a \u201ccredit per-\ncentage requirement.\u201d  Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(b)(1).  Be-\ncause electric vehicles with longer ranges can generate more than \none credit, the exact percentage of electric vehicles can vary from \nmanufacturer to manufacturer.

On his first day in office, President Biden signed \nExecutive Order 13,990, directing EPA to \u201cconsider \nsuspending, revising, or rescinding\u201d the 2019 with-\ndrawal of California\u2019s 2013 waiver.  86 Fed. Reg. 7,037, \n7,037 (Jan. 20, 2021).  EPA dutifully reinstated Califor-\nnia\u2019s waiver, allowing the Advanced Clean Cars pro-\ngram to come back into effect.  Pet. App. 57a. \nIn reinstating the waiver, EPA flipped back to its \n2013 interpretation of Section 209(b).  Pet. App. 155a.  \nUnder that interpretation, California can obtain a \nwaiver so long as it \u201cneeds its program as a whole to \nmeet compelling and extraordinary conditions\u201d\u2014even \nif it does not actually need the specific standards at is-\nsue.  C.A. EPA Br. 84 (emphasis added); see Pet. App. \n158a.  In other words, California can tack on any emis-\nsion standards it likes to its exempt emissions \u201cpro-\ngram,\u201d so long as the State\u2019s local criteria-pollutant \nproblems \u201cpersist.\u201d  C.A. EPA Br. 66.  Applying that \npermissive reading of the statute, EPA concluded that \nthe waiver was justified primarily because California \nneeds its separate vehicle-emission program, as a \nwhole, to address its ongoing problems with criteria \npollutants.  Pet. App. 155a-162a, 186a-188a. \nEPA embraced the significance of its action, herald-\ning the waiver as a \u201ccritical step to confront the climate \ncrisis.\u201d  EPA News Release.  To date, 17 States and the \nDistrict of Columbia have adopted California\u2019s  \ngreenhouse-gas emission standards, its zero-emission-\nvehicle mandate, or both.  California Air Resources \nBoard (CARB), States that Have Adopted California\u2019s \nVehicle Regulations (June 2024), https://perma.cc/ \n\n12 \n \nM6LC-SVR8.  Together with California, those jurisdic-\ntions account for more than 40% of the Nation\u2019s new \nvehicle market.  Pet. App. 179a. \nC. Proceedings Below \n1.  Petitioners are entities (and trade associations \nwhose members include entities) that produce or sell \nliquid fuels\u2014gasoline, diesel, biodiesel, renewable die-\nsel, and ethanol\u2014and the raw materials used to make \nthem.  They promptly challenged EPA\u2019s waiver rein-\nstatement in the D.C. Circuit in May 2022, within 60 \ndays of the agency action.  Pet. App. 15a.   \nAlong with their opening brief in the court of ap-\npeals, petitioners filed 14 standing declarations that \nexplained how reinstating California\u2019s standards would \ndepress demand for liquid fuel, injuring them finan-\ncially in a variety of ways.  J.A. 120-184.  Fuel produc-\ners explained how reducing the demand for their prod-\nucts in California would lead to an unavoidable loss in \nbusiness.  J.A. 133-136.  For example, petitioner Dia-\nmond Alternative Energy explained that it sells renew-\nable diesel, a liquid fuel that can be used interchange-\nably with petroleum-derived diesel; that California \u201cac-\ncounts for almost all of the renewable diesel consumed \nin the United States\u201d; and that the standards would di-\nminish that demand.  J.A. 135. \nOther petitioners similarly established the negative \nimpact of California\u2019s standards on their bottom lines.  \nAn association of convenience stores explained that \nCalifornia\u2019s standards would mean its members\u2019 \u201cfuel-\ning stations sell less fuel\u201d and their convenience stores \nlose revenue because fewer customers \u201ccome through \n[their] stores.\u201d  J.A. 140.  And associations of corn \ngrowers noted that California\u2019s standards would drive \ndown demand for ethanol (which is blended into gaso-\nline), in turn \u201cdecreasing demand for the corn\u201d grown \n\n13 \n \nby their members to produce ethanol.  J.A. 130, 154, \n158, 167.   \nEPA did not contest petitioners\u2019 Article III stand-\ning below.  But California and other state and local gov-\nernment intervenors did.  J.A. 185-187.  They argued \nthat petitioners had not \u201cestablished any probability \nthat manufacturers would change course if EPA\u2019s \n[waiver] decision were vacated\u201d because automakers \nwere planning to increase electric-vehicle production \nfor independent reasons.  J.A. 187.  Their own inter-\nvention motion, however, attached declarations assert-\ning that \u201cadditional gasoline-fueled vehicles would be \nsold during these model years\u201d if EPA\u2019s waiver were \noverturned.  J.A. 115.   \nIn reply, petitioners explained that they had stand-\ning because vacating the waiver would remove a \u201cdirect \nregulatory impediment\u201d to their products\u2019 use.   \nJ.A. 210 (quoting Energy Future Coal., 793 F.3d at \n144).  Petitioners also pointed out that they were enti-\ntled to rely on the \u201creasonably predictable\u201d conduct of \ncar manufacturers.  Ibid.  Petitioners noted that Cali-\nfornia itself had predicted automakers would produce \nmore \u201czero-emission vehicles\u201d in response to its stand-\nards.  Ibid. (quoting C.A. J.A. 237).  And there was am-\nple record evidence that not all manufacturers had \u201cir-\nrevocably committed\u201d to electrification.  Ibid. (citing \nC.A. J.A. 477).  \nAt oral argument in September 2023, counsel for the \nstate and local government intervenors made argu-\nments sounding in mootness, not standing.  In response \nto questioning from the panel, California contended \nthat automakers could no longer change their produc-\ntion and sales plans for vehicles through model year \n2025\u2014the year in which the court apparently assumed \nthe waiver would end.  See C.A. Oral Arg. 1:10:27-\n\n14 \n \n1:10:31 (asserting that petitioners \u201cneed evidence that \nmanufacturers are going to change their product lines \nand sell different vehicles in model year 2025\u201d) (em-\nphasis added).  In reaction to that shifting theory of \njusticiability, petitioners moved to file a supplemental \nbrief and declarations explaining why their petitions \nwere not moot.  Petitioners also explained that the Cal-\nifornia standards covered by EPA\u2019s waiver purported \nto extend beyond model year 2025.  C.A. Pet. Supp. Br. \n5-6; see J.A. 50.  EPA remained conspicuously silent \nabout petitioners\u2019 standing and the temporal scope of \nthe waiver.   \n2. The court of appeals held that petitioners lack \nArticle III standing to challenge EPA\u2019s waiver.  Pet. \nApp. 19a.  Although the court declined to \u201cdefinitively \ndecide\u201d whether petitioners had established injury and \ncausation, it did not question either showing.  Id. at \n21a.   \nInstead, the court of appeals concluded that peti-\ntioners had failed to show that their injuries would be \nredressed if EPA\u2019s decision were set aside.  Pet. App. \n19a.  The court faulted petitioners for \u201cfail[ing] to point \nto any evidence affirmatively demonstrating that vaca-\ntur of the waiver would be substantially likely to\u201d \nprompt automakers to produce fewer electric vehicles \nor alter their prices so that more liquid-fuel-powered \nvehicles would be sold.  Id. at 23a.  It reasoned that \n\u201cunsupported assumptions regarding the future ac-\ntions of third-party market participants are insuffi-\ncient to establish Article III standing.\u201d  Id. at 29a.  The \ncourt also thought that the redressability inquiry was \n\u201ccomplicated by the relatively short duration of the \nwaiver,\u201d id. at 22a, though it disclaimed any finding \nthat the case had been \u201cmooted by the passage of \n\n15 \n \ntime,\u201d id. at 25a.  By hinging its decision on redressa-\nbility, the court effectively held that even if the waiver \nhad been vacated at the moment EPA reinstated it in \n2022, automakers might not have changed any produc-\ntion plans or prices before the end of model year 2025.  \nId. at 22a-24a.  The waiver was pointless the instant it \nwas reinstated. \nThe court of appeals declined to consider petition-\ners\u2019 supplemental brief and declarations.  Pet. App. \n30a.  The court reasoned that there was no \u201cgood \ncause\u201d to supplement the record.  Id. at 31a. \nD. Subsequent Developments \n1. Petitioners sought review in this Court.  In re-\nsponse, EPA explained that while the court of appeals \nhad based its redressability holding on the \u201crelatively \nshort duration of the waiver,\u201d Pet. App. 22a, in EPA\u2019s \nview the waiver does not actually sunset.  EPA Br. in \nOpp. 12-13.  According to EPA, California\u2019s greenhouse-\ngas standards continue to \u201cremain in force\u201d after model \nyear 2025, and \u201cthe waiver likewise does not terminate \nwith model-year 2025.\u201d  Id. at 13.   \nShortly thereafter, EPA took the same position in a \ndifferent regulatory action.  In proposing to approve \nCalifornia\u2019s request to include the Advanced Clean \nCars greenhouse-gas emission standards in the State\u2019s \nupdated state implementation plan, EPA credited Cal-\nifornia\u2019s July 2021 projections that those standards will \nreduce fuel consumption, and thus reduce nitrogen- \noxide and particulate-matter emissions, through at \nleast 2037.  89 Fed.

On December 17, 2024, EPA granted two new \nSection 209(b) preemption waivers for California, in-\ncluding for the \u201cAdvanced Clean Cars II\u201d program.  \n\n16 \n \nSee 90 Fed. Reg. 642, 642 (Jan. 6, 2025).  That program \n\u201cwill require all new passenger cars and light-duty \ntrucks delivered for sale in California to be zero- \nemission\u201d by 2035.

Starting \nwith model year 2026, Advanced Clean Cars II thus re-\nplaces the zero-emission-vehicle standards challenged \nhere, which apply through model year 2025.5 \nAdvanced Clean Cars II does not, however, amend \nthe challenged greenhouse-gas emission standards.  \nSee EPA Br. in Opp. 5; ACC II Decision Document 40 \nn.96.  Those standards will remain at the model-year \n2025 level of stringency for \u201csubsequent\u201d model years \nand will \u201ccontinue to be covered\u201d by the Advanced \nClean Cars I waiver \u201creinstated in 2022.\u201d  Cal.

They have Article III standing to chal-\nlenge an EPA waiver allowing California to enforce  \nvehicle-emission standards designed to reduce the con-\nsumption of liquid fuel.  The court of appeals was wrong \nto conclude otherwise. \nI. Although the court of appeals did not consider \nthe first two prongs of Article III\u2019s standing require-\nments, petitioners easily established that they have \n \n5 \nAt least some of petitioners plan to challenge EPA\u2019s recent \ndecision to grant that waiver, and one challenge has already been \nfiled.  American Free Enter. Chamber of Com. v. EPA, No. 25-106 \n(9th Cir.).  \n\n17 \n \nsuffered a concrete injury-in-fact fairly traceable to \nEPA\u2019s waiver.  \nA. EPA\u2019s preemption waiver for California\u2019s Ad-\nvanced Clean Cars program hits petitioners with a \nclassic pocketbook injury.  Petitioners produce liquid \nfuel and its component parts, so any reduction in de-\nmand for their products brings down their bottom \nlines.  Petitioners attested to their injuries in their \nmany standing declarations submitted to the court of \nappeals, in which they explained the details of their \nbusinesses and how reduced demand for liquid fuels \nlowers their revenues. \nB. EPA\u2019s waiver causes petitioners\u2019 injuries.  The \nwaiver allows California to enforce its zero-emission-\nvehicle mandate and its greenhouse-gas emission \nstandards\u2014both of which mandate the production of \nvehicles that use less or no liquid fuel.  California\u2019s \nstandards push the car market beyond what consumers \nwould ordinarily demand and automakers would ordi-\nnarily produce and sell; that is the point of the stand-\nards.  There is thus a clear causal connection between \nCalifornia\u2019s market intervention and petitioners\u2019  \nmarket-based injuries.  \nII.  Petitioners\u2019 injuries are redressable for three \nreasons.   \nA. Most simply, a decision vacating EPA\u2019s waiver \nwould remove a regulatory impediment to the use of \npetitioners\u2019 products.  As this Court has found in a va-\nriety of circumstances, the removal of the coercive ef-\nfect of government action on third parties alone suf-\nfices to establish redressability.  Challengers do not \nneed to supply additional record evidence of third par-\nties\u2019 likely reactions.  That is because such challengers \n(or their products) are being denied an opportunity to \n\n18 \n \ncompete in the marketplace, which vacating the gov-\nernment action will redress.  Redressability, after all, \nfocuses on the match between the judicial relief re-\nquested and the injury suffered\u2014and when challeng-\ners seek to vacate a rule targeting their products, the \nmatch is perfect.   \nB. Even if this Court declines to adopt that categor-\nical rule, petitioners can at least establish redressabil-\nity by relying on the predictable effects of the chal-\nlenged government action on third parties.  This Court \nhas time and again distinguished between speculative \nand predictable third-party responses to a judicial de-\ncision.  When a third-party response is speculative, rec-\nord evidence may be required to establish redressabil-\nity.  But when a third-party response is predictable, no \nmore is needed than a dose of common sense.   \nIt is not just predictable but obvious that allowing \nCalifornia to limit vehicles\u2019 emissions will result in less \nfuel consumption.  California\u2019s standards require that \nautomakers produce and sell more fuel-efficient cars \nand fewer cars that run on liquid fuel.  If EPA\u2019s waiver \nis set aside and California\u2019s standards are preempted, \nat least one automaker will choose to sell more vehicles \nwith lower fuel efficiency or more combustion-engine \nvehicles.  It is difficult to imagine that the parties and \ntheir many amici would have litigated this case for \nnearly three years and counting if that were not true.   \nC.  The court of appeals rejected these two straight-\nforward theories of redressability.  Instead, it imposed \nextraordinary burdens on entities indirectly affected \nby agency action, effectively requiring evidence from \nthe directly regulated entities themselves.  The court \nalso raised timing concerns that conflated redressabil-\nity and mootness, with significant consequences.  Its \nmisplaced redressability label flipped the burden of \n\n19 \n \nproof from the government to petitioners, while leaving \npetitioners without recourse to established mootness \nexceptions.   \nIf left uncorrected, the decision below would have \npractical repercussions as serious as its doctrinal er-\nrors.  A heightened redressability requirement would \nlock the courthouse doors to numerous traditional chal-\nlengers to agency action, so long as the targets of reg-\nulation have different interests than directly regulated \nparties (as is often the case).  It would also encourage \nagencies to intentionally act on shorter time horizons \nto shield their actions from review, and it would cut off \nreview of the most politically sensitive actions.  \nD.  At a minimum, petitioners\u2019 injuries are redress-\nable even under the court of appeals\u2019 mistaken reason-\ning, because EPA has now conceded that its waiver for \ncertain California standards does not sunset.  The \ncourt of appeals was concerned about what it viewed as \nthe relatively short four-year duration of the waiver.  \nBut as EPA has since explained to this Court, its \nwaiver does not expire unless California changes its \nstandards, and California has never amended its \ngreenhouse-gas standards.  Put differently, the \nwaiver\u2019s effects do not expire after model year 2025.  \nThere thus can be no plausible dispute that vacating \nthe waiver will have some effect on automaker behavior \nat some point in the future.  Standards that regulate \nmarket allocation forever are all but guaranteed to \nhave at least one dollar of economic impact. \nARGUMENT \nTo demonstrate Article III standing, a plaintiff \nmust show that he suffered a concrete injury, that the \ninjury is fairly traceable to the challenged action, and \nthat the \u201cinjury will be redressed by a favorable deci-\nsion.\u201d  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 \n\n20 \n \n(1992) (citation omitted).  Taken collectively, these re-\nquirements ensure that federal courts decide only \u201cthe \nrights of individuals,\u201d and maintain \u201ctheir proper  \nfunction in a limited and separated government.\u201d  \nTransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413, 423 (2021) \n(citations omitted). \nWhen a plaintiff is directly regulated by a chal-\nlenged agency action, \u201cthere is ordinarily little ques-\ntion\u201d that he has standing to challenge the action.  \nLujan, 504 U.S. at 561.  By contrast, when a \u201cplaintiff \nis not himself the object of the government action or \ninaction he challenges, standing is . . . ordinarily \u2018sub-\nstantially more difficult\u2019 to establish.\u201d  Id. at 562 (cita-\ntion omitted).  Nevertheless, \u201centire classes of admin-\nistrative litigation\u201d have \u201ctraditionally been brought \nby unregulated\u201d but \u201cadversely affected parties.\u201d  Cor-\nner Post, Inc. v. Board of Governors of the Fed. Rsrv. \nSys., 603 U.S. 799, 827, 833 (2024) (Kavanaugh, J., con-\ncurring); see id. at 833-837 (collecting cases).  Those \nchallenges make particular sense where government \nregulations target someone \u201cdownstream or upstream\u201d \nfrom the entities that the regulations directly govern.  \nAlliance for Hippocratic Medicine, 602 U.S. at 384. \nPetitioners here are not directly regulated, but they \nare the prime targets of government regulation.  They \neasily satisfy the three components of Article III \nstanding.  Petitioners produce, refine, or sell liquid \nfuels and the raw materials used to produce them.  \nThey promptly challenged EPA\u2019s waiver, which allows \nCalifornia to impose otherwise-preempted standards \nthat are designed to reduce the use of liquid fuel\u2014 \nhitting petitioners with a classic pocketbook injury.  \nSetting aside EPA\u2019s waiver would mean that California \n\n21 \n \ncannot enforce its standards, ending the artificial de-\npression of demand for petitioners\u2019 products.  This case \nshould be no more complicated than that. \nI. PETITIONERS SUFFERED AN INJURY-IN-\nFACT CAUSED BY EPA\u2019S ACTION \n \nThe court of appeals skipped the injury and causa-\ntion prongs of standing, resting its holding entirely on \nredressability grounds.  That may be because petition-\ners easily satisfy the first two prongs of the Article III \nstanding analysis.  Petitioners suffered concrete and \nparticularized injuries, and those injuries are fairly \ntraceable to EPA\u2019s waiver decision. \nA. Petitioners \nSuffered \nClassic \nPocketbook  \nInjuries \n \nPetitioners include businesses at every stage of the \nsupply chain for liquid fuels.  They grow the raw mate-\nrials for liquid fuel, produce and refine liquid fuel, and \nsell liquid fuel at gas stations and convenience stores.  \nSee, e.g., J.A. 127-128 (producers of corn to make etha-\nnol), 131-132 (producers and sellers of renewable liquid \nfuels), 138-139 (owners of gas stations and convenience \nstores).  Petitioners differ in the exact nature of their \nbusinesses, but they all have one thing in common:  they \nprofit from participating in the liquid-fuels market. \nBy design, California\u2019s standards operate to reduce \nthe liquid-fuels market and thus injure those who par-\nticipate in it.  That is because the Advanced Clean Cars \nstandards aim to reduce emissions by reducing liquid \nfuel combustion in vehicles.  To comply, manufacturers \nmust produce more electric vehicles, subsidize the pro-\nduction of electric vehicles, implement technologies \nthat improve the fuel efficiency of vehicles, or some \ncombination thereof.  See J.A. 8-9 (identifying possible \ncompliance technologies); 78 Fed. Reg. at 2,136-2,137 \n\n22 \n \n(same).  The standards thus force automakers to pro-\nduce a fleet of vehicles that use significantly less liquid \nfuel or no liquid fuel at all.  In fact, California repeat-\nedly represented as much when applying for the chal-\nlenged waiver.  J.A. 35, 49.  Fewer cars that run on liq-\nuid fuel, or more cars that run on less liquid fuel, means \nless liquid fuel sold.  And suppressing demand for a \nparty\u2019s product is the prototypical monetary injury-in-\nfact.  See TransUnion, 594 U.S. at 425; United States \nv. Texas, 599 U.S. 670, 676 (2023).   \nPetitioners explained these prototypical pocketbook \ninjuries in the 14 standing declarations they submitted \nwith their opening brief below.  Those declarations de-\ntail how petitioners participate in the liquid-fuel supply \nchain and how the reduction in demand caused by Cal-\nifornia\u2019s standards would financially injure their busi-\nnesses.  See J.A. 120-184.  For example, producers ex-\nplained that a \u201csignificant reduction in California\u2019s gas-\noline demand, as contemplated by the [Advanced Clean \nCars] I program, will detrimentally impact Valero\u2019s \nbusiness.\u201d  J.A. 147.  And they confirmed their inability \nto \u201cavoid financial harm\u201d by shifting production out-\nside of California or by repurposing their products.  \nJ.A. 170; see J.A. 144-145, 147-150.  As these declara-\ntions underscore, petitioners have a concrete stake in \nthe outcome:  their businesses are on the line.  \u201cThis is \na classic pocketbook injury sufficient to give [them] \nstanding.\u201d  Tyler v. Hennepin Cnty., 598 U.S. 631, 636 \n(2023).   \nB. Petitioners\u2019 Injuries Are Fairly Traceable To \nEPA\u2019s Waiver \nPetitioners likewise satisfy Article III\u2019s causation \nrequirement.  To demonstrate causation, a party must \nestablish a \u201ccausal connection between the injury and \nthe conduct complained of.\u201d  Susan B. Anthony List v. \n\n23 \n \nDriehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 158 (2014) (citation omitted).  \nThat \u201crequires only that the plaintiff\u2019s injury be fairly \ntraceable to the defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d  Lexmark Int\u2019l, \nInc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, \n134 n.6 (2014).  The connection between petitioners\u2019 in-\njuries and EPA\u2019s waiver is straightforward here.  The \nwaiver allows California\u2019s greenhouse-gas emission \nstandards and zero-emission-vehicle mandate to take \neffect, when federal law would otherwise preempt \nthem.  Pet. App. 55a-57a.  Those portions of the Ad-\nvanced Clean Cars program operate by requiring in-\ncreased fuel economy or full electrification, thereby de-\npressing demand for petitioners\u2019 products.   \nPetitioners\u2019 injuries are attributable to government \nregulation, not solely to existing consumer demand for \nelectric vehicles.  The entire purpose of California\u2019s \nstandards is to go beyond what market forces would \nnaturally produce.  That is why California described its \nregulations as \u201ccritical\u201d for \u201cemissions reductions\u201d and \n\u201ccritical for incentivizing production and deployment of \nzero-emission vehicles.\u201d  J.A. 66.  Those standards in-\nclude a 22% zero-emission-vehicle mandate, far above \nwhat the market had naturally produced.  Cal. Code \nRegs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(b)(1); see David Gohlke et al., As-\nsessment of Light-Duty Plug-in Electric Vehicles in \nthe United States, 2010\u20132021, at 1 (Nov. 1, 2022), \nhttps://perma.cc/Y6VE-2QB5.  Because California\u2019s \nstandards aim to reduce liquid-fuel use by increasing \nthe number of electric or fuel-efficient vehicles beyond \nmarket demand, petitioners have \u201clink[ed] their as-\nserted injuries to the government\u2019s regulation . . . of \nsomeone else.\u201d  Alliance for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. \nat 382. \n\n24 \n \nII. PETITIONERS\u2019 INJURIES ARE REDRESSABLE \nBecause petitioners suffered classic pocketbook in-\njuries caused by a federal regulatory action, and be-\ncause they challenged that action almost immediately, \nit would be unusual if petitioners\u2019 injuries were not re-\ndressable.  Redressability requires only that a favora-\nble judicial judgment would \u201ctake steps to slow or re-\nduce\u201d the plaintiff\u2019s injury.  Massachusetts v. EPA, \n549 U.S. 497, 525 (2007).  Thus, when a plaintiff asserts \nan economic injury, she establishes redressability if a \nfavorable decision would put even one dollar back in \nher pocket.  Uzuegbunam v. Preczewski, 592 U.S. 279, \n291 (2021).  That is no high bar.   \nThe bar is easily cleared here.  Most simply, the \nchallenged government action creates a legal hurdle to \nthe use of petitioners\u2019 products, so setting aside that \ngovernment action would provide redress.  And were \nthat not enough, petitioners can always rely on the \n\u201cpredictable effect\u201d of regulation on third parties to es-\ntablish redressability.  Department of Commerce,  \n588 U.S. at 768.  It is certainly predictable that an  \nelectric-vehicle mandate will result in fewer liquid-\nfuel-powered vehicles on the roads; that is the man-\ndate\u2019s raison d\u2019\u00eatre.  At a minimum, the decision below \nmust be vacated because it was premised on a factual \nmistake.  EPA has since confirmed that the waiver al-\nlowing California to target petitioners\u2019 products has no \ndefinite end date.  An agency action limiting the use of \npetitioners\u2019 products in perpetuity must have some \nreal-world effect. \n\n25 \n \nA. Petitioners Have Established Redressability \nBecause They Are Challenging A Regulatory \nHurdle To The Use Of Their Products \nCalifornia\u2019s Advanced Clean Cars standards re-\nquire car manufacturers to produce an increasing per-\ncentage of vehicles that consume less liquid fuel or no \nliquid fuel at all.  Because the standards impose a new \nlegal barrier to the use of petitioners\u2019 products\u2014and \nindeed reducing consumption of petitioners\u2019 products \nis how the standards achieve their intended purpose\u2014 \nvacating EPA\u2019s waiver would provide petitioners with \nredress.  Article III requires nothing more. \n1. Removing \nthe \ncoercive \neffect \nof  \ngovernment standards provides redress \na.  This Court has long recognized that removing the \n\u201cdeterminative or coercive effect\u201d of government reg-\nulation \u201cupon the action of someone else\u201d is sufficient \nto establish redressability.  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 169.  \nThus, if a plaintiff can establish the existence of a reg-\nulatory impediment that prevents its product from be-\ning used, that is enough. \nIn Bennett, this Court made clear that the removal \nof an adverse agency action\u2014even one that operates on \na third party\u2014provides redress to individuals injured \nby that action.  There, a group of ranchers challenged \na biological opinion issued by the U.S. Fish and Wild-\nlife Service, which advised the Bureau of Reclamation \nto maintain minimum water levels at several reservoirs \nthat the ranchers used.  520 U.S. at 159-160.  The gov-\nernment argued that Article III\u2019s causation and re-\ndressability requirements were not met because it was \npossible that the Bureau would independently opt to \nreduce the ranchers\u2019 access to water, even without the \nchallenged biological opinion.  Id. at 168.  This Court \nunanimously disagreed, recognizing that the biological \n\n26 \n \nopinion had a \u201cvirtually determinative effect\u201d on the \nBureau\u2019s decisions because disregarding it could ex-\npose the Bureau and its employees to liability under \nthe Endangered Species Act.  Id. at 170.  The removal \nof the \u201ccoercive\u201d force of the biological opinion on the \nBureau alone established redressability.  Id. at 171.  \nThe ranchers did not need to provide additional evi-\ndence to show that their injury was \u201cfairly traceable\u201d \nto the opinion or that it would \u201clikely be redressed\u201d if \nthe opinion were withdrawn.  Id. at 169-171. \nBennett made explicit what had been assumed in a \nlong line of this Court\u2019s cases resolving challenges to \ngovernment action brought by indirectly regulated \nparties.  For example, this Court heard a suit by pri-\nvate schools challenging as unconstitutional an Oregon \nlaw making it a crime for parents to send their children \nto private school.  Pierce v. Society of the Sisters of the \nHoly Names of Jesus and Mary, 268 U.S. 510, 534 \n(1925).  Although the parents were directly regulated, \nthe private schools were the target\u2014and there was no \ndoubt that they could bring the lawsuit.  The Court did \nnot require the schools to provide evidence that par-\nents would send their children to those schools absent \nOregon\u2019s \u201cunwarranted compulsion.\u201d  Id. at 535.  Simi-\nlarly, in CBS v. United States, this Court found that the \ntelevision network CBS could sue to challenge regula-\ntions denying a license to any broadcasting station that \nconducted certain business with CBS.  316 U.S. 407, \n421-423 (1942).  The Court did not call for evidence that \nlicensees would change course and partner with CBS if \nthe regulations were rescinded; it was enough that po-\ntential licensees intended to comply with the regula-\ntions.  Id. at 422.  \nb. The rule that removal of the \u201cunwarranted com-\npulsion\u201d of government action satisfies redressability \n\n27 \n \ncomports with the original purpose of the redressabil-\nity requirement.  As this Court has repeatedly ex-\nplained, redressability ensures that there is a \u201crela-\ntionship between \u2018the judicial relief requested\u2019 and the \n\u2018injury\u2019 suffered.\u201d  California v. Texas, 593 U.S. 659, \n660 (2021) (quoting Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 753 \nn.19 (1984)).  It thus prevents litigants from suing par-\nties or challenging laws that have \u201cnothing to do with\u201d \ntheir injuries, or requesting overly broad relief.  Id. at \n675; see Haaland v. Brackeen, 599 U.S. 255, 293 (2023) \n(redressability not established because \u201cstate officials \nwho implement [the challenged statute] are not parties \nto the suit\u201d).  And it similarly prevents courts from is-\nsuing \u201cadvisory opinion[s]\u201d that amount to nothing \nmore than \u201ca general authority to conduct oversight,\u201d \nparticularly \u201cof decisions of the elected branches of \nGovernment.\u201d  California, 593 U.S. at 673; see Brack-\neen, 599 U.S. at 294.   \nWhen a plaintiff asks a court to remove a coercive \ngovernment regulation, there is no mismatch between \ninjury and remedy.  Indeed, there is a perfect correla-\ntion between the individual\u2019s injury (which flows from \na constraint that may artificially depress market de-\nmand) and the remedy for that injury (removing the \ngovernment constraint).  And to the extent there are \ndistinct concerns about attenuation, those concerns are \nhoused in other doctrines, such as proximate-cause lim-\nitations that exclude plaintiffs whose injuries are \u201ctoo \nremote\u201d from the conduct a statute prohibits.  See, e.g., \nLexmark, 572 U.S. at 133.  As far as redressability is \nconcerned, however, Article III\u2019s demands are the \nsame whether the plaintiff is directly or indirectly reg-\nulated.   \nc. This Court should confirm the simple, clear rule \nthat the removal of a regulatory hurdle to the use of a \n\n28 \n \nchallenger\u2019s product satisfies Article III\u2019s redressabil-\nity requirement\u2014no matter whether the regulation is \nformally applied to a third party.  That rule has the \nbenefit of comporting not just with traditional under-\nstandings of redressability but also with basic logic.  As \nthen-Judge Kavanaugh put it, if \u201cthe Government pro-\nhibits or impedes Company A from using Company B\u2019s \nproduct,\u201d there is \u201cordinarily little question\u201d that Com-\npany B has standing, since Company B\u2019s product is the \nvery \u201cobject\u201d of the regulation.  Energy Future Coal., \n793 F.3d at 144.  Company B is being deprived of the \n\u201copportunity to compete in the marketplace,\u201d so a fa-\nvorable judicial decision will provide at least some re-\ndress.  Ibid.  Or as this Court has succinctly recognized, \nif a regulatory program causes an injury in fact, \u201c[i]t \nfollows\u201d that \u201ca judicial decree directing [the govern-\nment] to discontinue its program would \u2018redress\u2019 the \ninjury.\u201d  Northeastern Fla. Chapter of Associated Gen. \nConts. of Am. v. City of Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656, 666 \nn.5 (1993).  \n2. California\u2019s standards impose a new  \nregulatory hurdle to the use of petitioners\u2019 \nproducts  \nThe above rule\u2014that removal of a regulatory hurdle \nto the use of a challenger\u2019s product satisfies Article III\u2019s \nredressability requirement\u2014resolves this case.  Peti-\ntioners\u2019 injuries arise from the \u201cdeterminative or coer-\ncive effect\u201d of California\u2019s standards (allowed to go into \neffect by EPA) on third-party automakers.  Bennett, \n520 U.S. at 169.  Although California\u2019s standards do not \ndirectly impose obligations on petitioners, the stand-\nards require somebody else to make vehicles that use \nless of petitioners\u2019 products.  It should be irrelevant \nthat the requirement technically operates on automak-\ners; the government is simply reducing the use of liquid \n\n29 \n \nfuel by regulating the assembly line rather than the gas \npump.   \nAgain, the Advanced Clean Cars program includes \ntwo mechanisms that directly prevent market partici-\npants from consuming as much of petitioners\u2019 products \nas they otherwise might.  First, California\u2019s zero- \nemission-vehicle mandate requires automakers to pro-\nduce an increasing percentage of vehicles that consume \nno liquid fuel.  Second, California\u2019s greenhouse-gas \nemission standards require automakers to produce ve-\nhicles with increased fuel efficiency\u2014with a corre-\nsponding reduction in the use of liquid fuel.  Under ei-\nther mechanism, California\u2019s standards pose a legal \nbarrier to the use of petitioners\u2019 products.  In fact, Cal-\nifornia predicted that \u201c[t]he oil and gas industry, fuel \nproviders, and service stations are likely to be the most \nadversely affected by the proposed Advanced Clean \nCars program due to the substantial reductions in de-\nmand for gasoline.\u201d  J.A. 13.  Petitioners are therefore \nbeing denied the \u201copportunity to compete in the mar-\nketplace\u201d without California\u2019s interference.  Energy \nFuture Coal., 793 F.3d at 144.  Under this Court\u2019s cases \nand a traditional understanding of redressability, no \nmore record evidence is needed. \nB. Petitioners Have Established Redressability  \nBecause They Can Rely On The Predictable  \nEffect Of Emission Standards  \nEven if this Court does not apply a categorical rule \nbased on the removal of a regulatory hurdle to petition-\ners\u2019 products, petitioners can still establish redressa-\nbility through case-specific inferences about third-\nparty conduct.  Article III does not demand certainty; \nit requires that the requested remedy will likely re-\ndress petitioners\u2019 injuries.  That standard is satisfied \n\n30 \n \nhere, where the behavior of third parties is predictable \nrather than speculative. \n1. Litigants can rely on common sense  \nand basic economics to demonstrate  \nredressability \nIndirectly regulated parties have traditionally sat-\nisfied Article III\u2019s redressability requirement so long \nas the conduct of directly regulated parties is reasona-\nbly predictable.  If it is, then a favorable judicial deci-\nsion would \u201clikely\u201d redress injuries inflicted as a result \nof that third party\u2019s action\u2014which is what Article III \nrequires.  Davis v. Federal Election Comm\u2019n, 554 U.S. \n724, 733 (2008).  A contrary rule would shield from ju-\ndicial scrutiny many government actions aimed at indi-\nrectly regulated, but undeniably injured, parties. \na. When a plaintiff\u2019s injury arises from \u201cthe unfet-\ntered choices made by independent actors,\u201d a plaintiff \nmust show that the third party will behave in such a \nway as to \u201cpermit redressability of injury.\u201d  Lujan, \n504 U.S. at 562 (citation omitted).  In applying that \nrule, this Court has repeatedly distinguished between \nreliance on speculative third-party actions and reliance \non predictable third-party behavior.  Record evidence \nis required to bolster the former but not the latter. \nWhen third-party behavior is predictable, com-\nmonsense inferences can suffice.  This Court held as \nmuch in Department of Commerce, 588 U.S. 752.  \nThere, the Court concluded that a group of States with \na disproportionate share of noncitizens had standing to \nchallenge the inclusion of a citizenship question in the \ncensus.  Id. at 767.  Although the States\u2019 harm \u201cde-\npend[ed] on the independent action of third parties\u201d\u2014\nthe noncitizens living in those States\u2014it was \u201cpredict-\nable\u201d that noncitizens would be \u201creluctan[t] to answer \n\n31 \n \na citizenship question\u201d and thus potentially not re-\nspond at all.  Id. at 767-768.  The depressed population \ncount, in turn, could result in a diversion of resources \nfrom the State challengers.  Id. at 767.  The Court ac-\ncepted that predictable chain of events based on com-\nmon sense and historical practice.  Id. at 768.  It did not \nrequire the challengers to gather, for example, affida-\nvits from noncitizens asserting that they would not re-\nspond to a census with a citizenship question. \nAlthough Department of Commerce focused on cau-\nsation, its reasoning applies equally to Article III\u2019s re-\ndressability requirement.  After all, \u201ccausation and re-\ndressability . . . are often \u2018flip sides of the same coin.\u2019  \u201d  \nAlliance for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 380 (quot-\ning Sprint Commc\u2019ns Co. v. APCC Servs., Inc.,  \n554 U.S. 269, 288 (2008)).  For that reason, lower courts \nhave found Article III\u2019s redressability requirement \nsatisfied based on the predictable response of a third \nparty to a judicial decision in the plaintiff\u2019s favor.  See, \ne.g., Skyline Wesleyan Church v. California Dep\u2019t of \nManaged Health Care, 968 F.3d 738, 749-750 (9th Cir. \n2020). \nIndeed, this Court applied similar reasoning in \nMassachusetts v. EPA, when it determined that Mas-\nsachusetts satisfied Article III\u2019s redressability re-\nquirement by looking to the predictable effect on global \nclimate change of requiring EPA to regulate  \ngreenhouse-gas emissions.  549 U.S. at 525-526.  In \nfinding redressability, the Court attached \u201cconsidera-\nble significance\u201d to EPA\u2019s own statements about its \nregulatory priorities, which suggested that ordering \nEPA to set emission standards would cause fewer ve-\nhicle emissions and therefore redress petitioners\u2019 inju-\nries.  Id. at 526.  That is, the Court found that an effect \n\n32 \n \nis predictable, and sufficient to establish redressabil-\nity, when the agency itself presupposes that effect. \nb. By contrast, redressability cannot rest on mere \nspeculation.  This Court has articulated three circum-\nstances where relief is too speculative to satisfy the de-\nmands of Article III.  None is applicable here. \nFirst, when a plaintiff\u2019s causation or redressability \ntheory relies on \u201ccounterintuitive\u201d assumptions about \nthird-party behavior, the plaintiff may need to support \nthat theory with \u201cstronger evidence.\u201d  California, \n593 U.S. at 678.  That was true in California, where the \nState challengers failed to establish redressability be-\ncause they sought to attack a government healthcare \nmandate that lacked any enforcement mechanism.  The \nCourt found it \u201ccounterintuitive\u201d \u201cthat an unenforcea-\nble mandate will cause [the States\u2019] residents to enroll \nin valuable benefits programs that they would other-\nwise forgo,\u201d so the Court required \u201cstronger evidence\u201d \nthat the mandate would actually have such an effect.  \nIbid. \nSecond, redressability may also be too speculative if \na plaintiff relies on a chain of events with thin links be-\ntween them.  For example, in Alliance for Hippocratic \nMedicine, the plaintiffs relied on overly \u201ccomplicated \ncausation theories\u201d to establish their standing to sue.  \n602 U.S. at 386.  The plaintiff doctors claimed that they \nsuffered increased costs or potential liability as a result \nof the FDA\u2019s decisions to relax mifepristone regula-\ntions.  Id. at 387.  But the doctors would first have to \nexperience \u201can increase in the number of pregnant \nwomen seeking treatment\u201d for mifepristone complica-\ntions, and then those treatments would have to result \nin the doctors\u2019 being \u201csued or required to pay higher \ninsurance costs.\u201d  Id. at 391-392.  More \u201cevidence\u201d was \n\n33 \n \nneeded to prove that this chain of events was likely to \noccur.  Id. at 391.  \nThird, if the legal impact of a judicial decision is un-\nclear, redressability may be too speculative.  That was \ntrue in Brackeen, where the challenged statute was en-\nforced by non-party state officials, not the federal de-\nfendants.  As a result, this Court\u2019s opinion could at best \nserve \nas \na \n\u201cpersuasive . . . advisory \nopinion[].\u201d  \n599 U.S. at 294 (citations omitted).  A similar problem \nexisted in United States v. Texas, where the challenged \nguidelines \u201cmerely advise[d] federal officials about \nhow to exercise their prosecutorial discretion when it \ncomes to deciding which aliens to prioritize for arrest \nand removal.\u201d  599 U.S. at 691 (Gorsuch, J., concurring \nin the judgment).  And in Murthy v. Missouri, the gov-\nernment action had concluded by the time the suit was \nbrought, so a judicial decision also served a purely ad-\nvisory function.  603 U.S. 43, 72-73 (2024).  In all those \ncases, additional evidence was required to establish re-\ndressability not because the federal government was \nregulating a third party but because it was not actively \nregulating at all. \nc. The distinction between predictable effects \n(which do not require record evidence) and counterin-\ntuitive or unlikely effects (which do) is especially im-\nportant for lawsuits brought by indirectly regulated \nparties. \nThe Court reinforced this point just last Term in Al-\nliance for Hippocratic Medicine.  Even as it disap-\nproved the particular plaintiffs\u2019 standing theories, the \nCourt acknowledged \u201ca variety of familiar circum-\nstances where government regulation of a third-party \nindividual or business may be likely to cause injury in \nfact to an unregulated plaintiff.\u201d  602 U.S. at 384.  For \nexample, it is predictable that government regulation \n\n34 \n \nof one business \u201cmay cause downstream or upstream \neconomic injuries to others in the chain.\u201d  Ibid. (citing \nNational Credit Union Admin. v. First Nat\u2019l Bank & \nTrust Co., 522 U.S. 479, 488 n.4 (1998); General Motors \nCorp. v. Tracy, 519 U.S. 278, 286-287 (1997); Barlow  \nv. Collins, 397 U.S. 159, 162-164 (1970); and Associa-\ntion of Data Processing Serv. Orgs., Inc. v. Camp, 397 \nU.S. 150, 152 (1970)).  And it is predictable that when \nthe government \u201cregulates parks, national forests, or \nbodies of water,\u201d it will affect the users of those natural \nresources.  Id. at 385 (citing Summers v. Earth Island \nInst., 555 U.S. 488, 494 (2009)).  \u201cThe list goes on.\u201d  \nIbid. (citing Department of Commerce, 588 U.S. at 766-\n768).  In all such cases, plaintiffs rely on \u201ca predictable \nchain of events leading from the government action to \nthe asserted injury.\u201d  Ibid. \n2. Automakers would predictably adjust \ntheir fleets if EPA\u2019s waiver were vacated  \nThe effect of EPA\u2019s waiver on automakers is more \nthan predictable; it is obvious.  EPA\u2019s waiver puts in \nplace California\u2019s Advanced Clean Cars standards.  \nThose standards are specifically designed to reduce the \nnumber of conventional, liquid-fuel-powered vehicles \nthat would otherwise be produced.  J.A. 110, 115-116.  \nAnd no one has disputed that automakers have histor-\nically responded to California\u2019s greenhouse-gas emis-\nsion and zero-emission-vehicle standards by selling \nfewer conventional vehicles.  See 78 Fed. Reg. at 2,141-\n2,142.  After all, if that were not the historical response, \nCalifornia \u201cwould presumably not bother with such ef-\nforts.\u201d  Massachusetts, 549 U.S. at 526 (citation omit-\nted).   \nIn continuing to defend its standards, California has \nconfirmed that it is intentionally trying to reduce de-\n\n35 \n \nmand for petitioners\u2019 products.  California has repeat-\nedly told EPA that the State wants its greenhouse-gas \nemission standards to reduce the emissions that come \nfrom burning liquid fuel.  It has explained that its \nstandards increase the number of electric vehicles in \nuse, thereby avoiding the \u201cproduction and delivery of \ngasoline.\u201d  J.A. 84.  And California represented to EPA \nthat the standards were \u201ccritical not just for immediate \nemissions reductions but also\u201d for \u201cgreater emission \nreductions in the future.\u201d  J.A. 66.  If regulations are \n\u201ccritical\u201d in the government\u2019s telling, surely litigants \ncan reasonably predict that they will have some effect. \nThe bottom line here is unavoidable.  If EPA\u2019s \nwaiver is vacated, California can no longer force au-\ntomakers to make more electric vehicles or higher- \nefficiency vehicles than they would otherwise produce \nin response to market forces.  Free of government in-\nterference, automakers will respond to market de-\nmand, including by making more vehicles that run on \nmore liquid fuel or by adjusting their distribution plans \nor prices in ways that will result in more liquid-fuel-\npowered vehicle sales.  That theory of automaker be-\nhavior is far from speculative.  It is Economics 101. \nC. The \nCourt \nOf \nAppeals\u2019 \nRedressability  \nAnalysis Is Wrong \nUnder the principles discussed above, the redressa-\nbility inquiry should have been straightforward in this \ncase.  Vacating EPA\u2019s waiver would remove a legal ob-\nstacle to the use of petitioners\u2019 products, and au-\ntomaker behavior is predictable in any event.  Yet the \ncourt of appeals blinded itself to the obvious.  It con-\ncluded that petitioners do not have Article III standing \nby creating artificially high evidentiary barriers to es-\ntablishing redressability.  In so doing, the court made \n\n36 \n \nit nearly impossible for many parties indirectly af-\nfected by government action to secure judicial relief, \nand created incentives for government gamesmanship. \n1. The decision below contradicts this \nCourt\u2019s precedents and common sense  \na. The court of appeals overstated petitioners\u2019 bur-\nden to establish redressability.  Although the court \nacknowledged that it was \u201cpossible\u201d automakers would \nchange their plans and sell more liquid-fuel-powered \nvehicles or vehicles that use more liquid fuel if EPA\u2019s \nwaiver were vacated, it faulted petitioners for failing to \nsupply \u201crecord evidence\u201d to that effect, such as \u201caddi-\ntional affidavits.\u201d  Pet. App. 24a (internal quotation \nmarks omitted).  In the court\u2019s view, it was just as \nlikely that California\u2019s standards have no real-world \nimpact because some manufacturers are already sell-\ning \u201cmore qualifying vehicles in California than the \nState\u2019s standards require.\u201d  Id. at 28a (emphasis omit-\nted) (quoting J.A. 202).  And the court believed that \n\u201cunsupported assumptions regarding the future ac-\ntions of third-party market participants are insuffi-\ncient to establish Article III standing\u201d\u2014full stop.  Id. \nat 29a (internal quotation marks omitted). \nAs explained, the court of appeals\u2019 categorical evi-\ndentiary demand is doubly wrong.  First, it departs \nfrom Bennett and the D.C. Circuit\u2019s own precedent es-\ntablishing that the removal of a regulatory hurdle to \nthe use of the challenger\u2019s product satisfies redressa-\nbility.  See pp. 25-29, supra.  Indeed, the court of ap-\npeals did not even acknowledge its precedent holding \nthat \u201cremov[ing] a regulatory hurdle\u201d to the use of fuel \nsuffices to establish redressability.  Energy Future \nCoal., 793 F.3d at 144.  And second, petitioners were at \nleast entitled to rely on common sense:  automakers \nwould predictably produce more vehicles that use more \n\n37 \n \nliquid fuel if no longer subject to standards mandating \nthe production of certain quantities of electric or fuel-\nefficient vehicles.  See pp. 29-35, supra.   \nNor could the court of appeals rely on supposed \nmarket forces to justify its heightened redressability \nburden.  The limited evidence the court invoked sup-\nported the opposite conclusion.  The court relied on \nCalifornia\u2019s declaration explaining that automakers \nhad sold more electric vehicles than required in 2022\u2014\nlikely in anticipation of the increasingly stringent \nstandards for the ensuing years.  Pet. App. 28a (citing \nJ.A. 202).  That says nothing about how automakers \nwould respond if they did not need to meet California\u2019s \nstandards ever again.  The court also highlighted that \nthe intervening automakers had suggested that \u201cinter-\nnal sustainability forces and external market forces\u201d \nwere resulting in the production of more electric vehi-\ncles.  Id. at 24a n.8 (quoting C.A. Industry Resp.-Int. \nBr. 6-7).  But those automakers never said that every \nautomaker would exceed California\u2019s standards if the \nstandards were vacated.  To the contrary, as petition-\ners explained in reply, five individual automakers in-\ntervened precisely because a decision vacating the \nwaiver would put them at a \u201ccompetitive disad-\nvantage.\u201d  J.A. 211 (quoting C.A. Industry Resp.-Int. \nBr. 17).  That is, those five individual automakers were \nconcerned that other automakers\u2014many of whom have \nremained silent throughout this litigation\u2014would pull \nback their electric-vehicle numbers and instead sell \nmore liquid-fuel-powered vehicles.   \nb.  Even if petitioners were legally required to pro-\nduce record evidence to support redressability, plenty \nsuch evidence existed.  The record included 14 declara-\ntions explaining how California\u2019s standards depress de-\nmand for liquid fuel, and how petitioners\u2019 injuries \n\n38 \n \nwould be ameliorated if the waiver were vacated.  \nOther declarants further noted that California itself \nhad recently projected that the waiver would \u201creduce \nemissions through reductions in fuel production.\u201d  J.A. \n148 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see \nJ.A. 180; see also J.A. 174 (similar statements by Min-\nnesota, which has adopted California\u2019s standards).  Ad-\nditional record evidence likewise documented Califor-\nnia\u2019s position that it needs its greenhouse-gas stand-\nards to reduce motor-vehicle emissions and that doing \nso decreases liquid-fuel consumption.  That included \nCalifornia\u2019s 2021 comment representing that its stand-\nards are \u201ccritical not just for immediate emissions re-\nductions but also\u201d for \u201cgreater emission reductions in \nthe future.\u201d  J.A. 66.  And California elsewhere had \npublicly explained that the standards increase the \nnumber of electric vehicles in use, thereby avoiding \n\u201cproduction and delivery of gasoline.\u201d  J.A. 84.   \nNone of this evidence was enough for the court of \nappeals.  In context, the court apparently thought that \npetitioners could meet their burden of showing re-\ndressability only by providing affidavits from automak-\ners promising to change production or pricing if the \nwaiver were vacated.  This Court has never required \nthe endorsement of a directly regulated third party be-\nfore an indirectly regulated party can sue, and it should \nnot create such a rule now.  Doing so would make it \nimpossible for many parties indirectly affected by gov-\nernment action to secure judicial relief and would cre-\nate incentives for government gamesmanship.  See  \npp. 41-45, infra.  \n\n39 \n \n2. The \ndecision \nbelow \nconflates  \nredressability with mootness \nThe decision below creates additional doctrinal con-\nfusion because it conflates mootness and redressabil-\nity.  The court of appeals thought that the redressabil-\nity inquiry here was \u201cfurther complicated by the rela-\ntively short duration of the waiver.\u201d  Pet. App. 22a.  As \nthe court saw it, petitioners needed to demonstrate not \nonly that manufacturers were likely to respond to a ju-\ndicial decision vacating the waiver by \u201cchanging their \nfleets,\u201d but also that they \u201cwould do so relatively \nquickly\u2014by Model Year 2025\u201d\u2014the year in which the \ncourt believed EPA\u2019s waiver terminated.  Id. at 23a.  In \nthe court\u2019s view, because vehicle product cycles \u201ccan \nalso begin years before a vehicle is launched,\u201d it was \n\u201cfar from clear\u201d that automakers could \u201cchange \ncourse . . . within the model years covered by the \nwaiver.\u201d  Id. at 24a. \nThose (misplaced) timing concerns sound in moot-\nness, not redressability.  Redressability, like the other \nelements of standing, is assessed at the time the suit is \nfiled.  See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 569 n.4.  Here, petitioners \nbrought suit immediately after EPA\u2019s waiver rein-\nstatement in 2022.  At that point, the waiver was sched-\nuled to be in effect for nearly four years.  There was \nample evidence in the record that automakers are at \nleast nimble enough to change a production choice or a \nvehicle price four years in advance\u2014surely enough to \naffect a single dollar of petitioners\u2019 sales.  See pp. 37-\n38, supra; J.A. 209-211.  Indeed, the court of appeals \nrelied on a comment from Toyota explaining that some \nmanufacturers were producing their vehicle fleets one \nyear in advance\u2014which affirmatively undermines the \nnotion that no manufacturer could change plans four \nyears in advance.  Pet. App. 24a; see J.A. 98-100. \n\n40 \n \nGiven that context, the court\u2019s emphasis on the \u201crel-\natively short nature of the waiver\u201d makes sense only as \na concern that the case was approaching model year \n2025 still unresolved.  Pet. App. 25a; see C.A. Oral Arg. \n34:46-34:49 (Garcia, J.) (\u201c[Y]ou need about two more \nyears to plan and adjust how you\u2019re producing vehicles, \nand I don\u2019t see how we can assume that\u2019s going to hap-\npen by model year [20]25.\u201d).  But it \u201cis the doctrine of \nmootness, not standing, that addresses whether \u2018an in-\ntervening circumstance has deprived the plaintiff of a \npersonal stake in the outcome of the lawsuit.\u2019  \u201d  West \nVirginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, 719 (2022) (quoting \nGenesis HealthCare Corp. v. Symczyk, 569 U.S. 66, 72 \n(2013)).  Indeed, the federal government recently ex-\nplained to this Court that when its regulations operate \non a short time horizon, Article III concerns should be \nevaluated under the rubric of mootness, not redressa-\nbility.  See FCC Br. 14, FCC v. Consumers\u2019 Research, \nNo. 24-354 (explaining that the mootness doctrine ap-\nplies when \u201cthe challenged action is in its duration too \nshort to be fully litigated\u201d) (citation omitted). \nThat \u201cdistinction matters\u201d for several reasons.  \nWest Virginia, 597 U.S. at 719.  First, although plain-\ntiffs have the burden to establish Article III standing, \nthe burden flips for mootness.  EPA thus would \u201cbear[] \nthe burden to establish that a once-live case has be-\ncome moot.\u201d  Ibid.  And neither intervenors nor EPA \npointed the court of appeals to evidence sufficient to \nshow that automakers\u2019 decisions have become irrevo-\ncable.  Because the court misconstrued its mootness \nconcern as a redressability obstacle, they had no need \nto.   \nSecond, because mootness would have been a new \ndevelopment, the court below would have had to con-\n\n41 \n \nsider the supplemental record evidence that petition-\ners offered.  Counsel for the state and local government \nintervenors made arguments sounding in mootness for \nthe first time at oral argument.  In response, petition-\ners submitted supplemental declarations from individ-\nuals experienced in vehicle-emission compliance.  \nThose declarations explained that \u201cautomobile manu-\nfacturers could and likely would change their produc-\ntion, pricing, and/or distribution plans for Model Year \n2025 as late as December 2025, but at a minimum well \ninto 2025.\u201d  J.A. 215, 220.  But the court rejected peti-\ntioners\u2019 supplemental brief and accompanying declara-\ntions as too late to show redressability.  Pet. App. 31a.  \nHad the court properly characterized California\u2019s ar-\nguments as newly raised concerns about mootness, \nthere would have been no doubt about the propriety of \npetitioners\u2019 supplemental responses.   \nThird, and critically, mootness doctrine contains ex-\nceptions that redressability does not.  In particular, if \nthere is a concern about the \u201crelatively short nature of \nthe waiver,\u201d Pet. App. 25a, then the case would be an \nexcellent candidate for applying \u201cthe established ex-\nception to mootness for disputes capable of repetition, \nyet evading review.\u201d  Federal Election Comm\u2019n v. Wis-\nconsin Right To Life, Inc., 551 U.S. 449, 462 (2007).  \nBut if that concern is improperly characterized as go-\ning to redressability, the challengers are out of luck.   \n3. The decision below creates bad policy \nThe decision below stacks bad policy on top of bad \nlaw.  It would put injured businesses at the mercy of \nregulated third parties whose interests may not align, \nincentivize agency mischief, and create a one-way \nratchet in favor of regulators over the regulated. \n\n42 \n \na. To start, the court of appeals\u2019 rule means that in-\ndirectly regulated entities will often be unable to chal-\nlenge government action that undeniably injures them.  \nThat is because an indirectly regulated entity\u2019s stand-\ning will often depend on the actions of directly regu-\nlated parties.  And the interests of directly regulated \nparties and downstream or upstream entities often di-\nverge.  That was the case where \u201cworkers challenged a \nDepartment of Labor rule that unlawfully allowed em-\nployers to access inexpensive foreign labor, with the ef-\nfect of lowering American workers\u2019 wages.\u201d  Corner \nPost, 603 U.S. at 836 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring) (cit-\ning Mendoza v. Perez, 754 F.3d 1002 (D.C. Cir. 2014)).  \nIt is also the case where a business challenges under-\nregulation of a competitor.  See, e.g., Monsanto Co.  \nv. Geertson Seed Farms, 561 U.S. 139, 153-156 (2010) \n(conventional alfalfa farmers had standing to challenge \nderegulation of genetically modified alfalfa); General \nMotors Corp., 519 U.S. at 282, 286-287 (purchaser of \nnatural gas had standing to challenge Ohio\u2019s differen-\ntial tax treatment of gas sales by certain Ohio utilities \nand gas sales by out-of-state sellers).  Justiciable \nclaims of under-regulation may also come from outside \nthe industry, as when insurance companies challenged \nthe recission of vehicle safety standards.  See Motor \nVehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of U.S. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. \nIns. Co., 463 U.S. 29 (1983). \nEven when directly regulated entities and upstream \nor downstream entities are not squarely at odds, other \nconsiderations might prevent a regulated party from \njoining the effort to challenge government action.  \nMembers of the directly regulated industry may be \nmore minimally burdened by an action than down-\nstream actors.  The regulated entity may be unwilling \n\n43 \n \nto risk negative publicity by challenging a popular gov-\nernment action, especially if it has less at stake.  The \ngovernment may have effectively purchased the regu-\nlated entity\u2019s cooperation by doling out countervailing \nregulatory benefits.  Or businesses might simply lack \nthe appetite to confront their regulator in court.   \nThose risks are particularly acute in industries that \nrequire lead time to comply with standards.  In such \nindustries, regulated entities may prefer to cooperate \nwith the agency in exchange for certainty about the fu-\nture regulatory environment or other benefits. The \nagency action may still have sweeping effect, but the \nonly viable plaintiffs would have no incentive to bring \nsuit.  That was true here, where automakers had incen-\ntives to cooperate with EPA and California to obtain \nregulatory stability and to avoid the perceived negative \npublicity of interfering with California\u2019s environmental \nefforts.  In short, one industry should not be held hos-\ntage to a related industry\u2019s incentives.   \nb. The decision below creates troubling incentives \nfor agencies, too.  It teaches agencies that they can tar-\nget entire industries with crippling burdens so long as \nthey act through a conduit and placate that conduit.  \nHere, EPA, California, and several automakers en-\ntered into \u201cCalifornia Framework Agreements\u201d com-\nmitting the automakers to accede to California\u2019s stand-\nards in exchange for certain benefits like additional \nlead time.  CARB, Framework Agreements on Clean \nCars (Aug. 17, 2020), https://perma.cc/ZM4Z-GDEK.  \nHaving entered into those agreements, the select au-\ntomakers that intervened in this case were forced into \ndefending California\u2019s standards, lest they be left to \ncompete in a market undisturbed by California\u2019s artifi-\ncial distortions.  But appeasing the directly regulated \nindustry should not insulate agency action from review, \n\n44 \n \nparticularly if that action cripples numerous other in-\ndustries.  \nA too-demanding redressability standard may also \nencourage agencies to act over shorter time horizons to \navoid meaningful review.  Under the reasoning of the \ncourt below, EPA\u2019s latest waiver decision was effec-\ntively unchallengeable because it applied \u201conly\u201d over \nfour years.  Pet. App. 22a.  That reasoning would have \nthe perverse effect of shielding from review the most \nimportant and politically sensitive issues on which \npresidential administrations may disagree.  See, e.g., \nWest Virginia, 597 U.S. at 715-718 (describing the his-\ntory of EPA\u2019s Clean Power Plan across presidential ad-\nministrations).  California\u2019s Section 209(b) waivers for \nclimate-change-focused standards are a perfect exam-\nple:  EPA has granted or rescinded a waiver like clock-\nwork with each change in administration.  An inflated \nredressability standard all but guarantees that these \ncourse-changes mean that agency authority is never \nsettled, even in the most consequential cases.   \nc. Finally, the decision below creates a one-way \nratchet in favor of the regulator over the regulated.  A \nState will always have \u201ca legitimate interest in the con-\ntinued enforceability of its own statutes,\u201d regardless of \ntheir effects.  Maine v. Taylor, 477 U.S. 131, 137 (1986).  \nA State\u2019s interest in vindicating its laws would presum-\nably allow California to challenge or intervene to de-\nfend any decision granting or denying a waiver.  See \nC.A. State & Local Gov. Intervention Mot. 10 (citing \nAlaska v. Department of Transp., 868 F.2d 441, 444 \n(D.C. Cir. 1989)).  As California puts it, with EPA\u2019s \n\u201cwaiver, its standards have legal force; without it, they \ndo not,\u201d so it need not show that the waiver influences \nthe \u201cmix of cars.\u201d  Cal. Br. in Opp. 14 n.5 (citing Alli-\nance for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 382).  But under \n\n45 \n \nthe court of appeals\u2019 theory, industries targeted by \nCalifornia\u2019s laws have no such luck.   \nD. At \nThe \nVery \nLeast, \nPetitioners \nHave  \nEstablished \nRedressability \nBecause \nThe \nChallenged Waiver Continues In Perpetuity  \nIf there were any doubt that petitioners\u2019 injuries are \nredressable, EPA\u2019s recent admission that its waiver \nhas no definite end point should remove it.  Even under \nthe court of appeals\u2019 unduly high bar for redressability, \npetitioners have standing to challenge what EPA now \nfreely describes as an open-ended waiver allowing Cal-\nifornia to impose emission standards in perpetuity.  \n1.  The court of appeals\u2019 standing analysis was \npremised on its assumption that the waiver, and thus \nCalifornia\u2019s standards, would sunset after 2025.  Pet. \nApp. 14a, 22a.  As noted, the court viewed the \u201crela-\ntively short duration of the waiver\u201d as \u201ccomplicat[ing]\u201d \nthe redressability analysis.  Id. at 22a.  According to \nthe court, petitioners needed to demonstrate not only \nthat manufacturers were likely to respond to a judicial \ndecision vacating the waiver by \u201cchanging their fleets,\u201d \nbut also that manufacturers would do so \u201crelatively \nquickly\u2014by Model Year 2025.\u201d  Id. at 23a (emphasis \nadded).  And the court found it \u201cfar from clear\u201d that \nmanufacturers would change their prices or production \ncycles by model year 2025.  Id. at 24a.  \nEPA has now admitted that the D.C. Circuit\u2019s cen-\ntral premise was incorrect.  In opposing certiorari, \nEPA candidly explained that its waiver has no end \ndate.  See EPA Br. in Opp. 12-13.  \u201cContrary to the \ncourt of appeals\u2019 suggestion,\u201d EPA told this Court, the \nwaiver \u201cdoes not expire after model-year 2025.\u201d  Id. at \n12.  When this lawsuit was filed, both the zero- \nemission-vehicle mandate and the greenhouse-gas \nemission standards applied to model year 2025 \u201cand \n\n46 \n \nsubsequent.\u201d  J.A 50 (emphasis added).  In 2022, after \npetitioners sued, California amended its zero-emission-\nvehicle mandate to sunset after model year 2025.  See \np. 16, supra.  But California\u2019s greenhouse-gas emission \nstandards continue to \u201cremain in force\u201d after model \nyear 2025.  EPA Br. in Opp. 13.  So in approving the \nwaiver, EPA approved standards that do not expire un-\nless California chooses to replace them, which it has \nnot done for its greenhouse-gas standards. \nAfter this certiorari petition was fully briefed, EPA \nformalized its position that California\u2019s greenhouse-\ngas emission standards do not sunset.  In its December \n17, 2024 decision granting California\u2019s waiver request \nfor its new Advanced Clean Cars II standards, EPA \nexplained that California\u2019s \u201c[greenhouse-gas] emission \nstandards applicable to 2025 and subsequent model \nyears remain[] unchanged.\u201d  ACC II Decision Docu-\nment 40 n.96.  Those emission standards did not need \nany further approval from EPA; they \u201ccontinue to be \ncovered by EPA\u2019s [Advanced Clean Cars] I waiver is-\nsued in 2013 . . . and reinstated in 2022.\u201d  Ibid. \n2. Given EPA\u2019s newly articulated position, it should \nbe beyond question that vacating the challenged waiver \nwould ameliorate petitioners\u2019 injuries at least to some \ndegree.  Even if the court of appeals were right that it \nwould take several years for every automaker to \nchange its production cycle, Pet. App. 23a, some of the \nrelevant standards are set to govern for more than sev-\neral years.  In other words, while the court below wor-\nried that vehicle manufacturers could not change \ncourse \u201cquickly\u201d enough, ibid., speed should not have \nbeen a concern.  Vacating an indefinite waiver permit-\nting California to enforce stringent emission standards \nwould necessarily have some effect on vehicle pricing, \nproduction, or distribution at some future point\u2014\n\n47 \n \nthereby alleviating at least one dollar of the artificially \ndepressed demand for petitioners\u2019 products.   \nCalifornia and EPA have since made factual find-\nings confirming that the perpetual greenhouse-gas \nemission standards will depress demand for liquid fuel \ninto the next decade.  In recently proposing to approve \nCalifornia\u2019s request to revise its state implementation \nplan, EPA accepted California\u2019s prediction that its \ngreenhouse-gas standards would \u201cachieve additional \ncriteria pollutant emission reductions\u201d in the State \nthrough at least 2037.  89 Fed. Reg. at 82,557 & n.19 \n(citing J.A. 93-94).  Citing the same analysis it had sub-\nmitted when urging EPA to reinstate the challenged \nwaiver, California reiterated that its greenhouse-gas \nemission standards target liquid fuel.  Specifically, Cal-\nifornia attributed the criteria-pollutant reductions to \nthe \u201cavoided production and delivery of gasoline\u201d from \nautomakers\u2019 compliance with those ongoing standards.  \nId. at 82,559 & n.37 (citing J.A. 84).  That analysis\u2014\nembraced by EPA as \u201creasonable and adequately  \nsupported\u201d\u2014recognizes that California\u2019s greenhouse-\ngas emission standards will continue to affect liquid-\nfuel consumption for more than a decade.  Id. at 82,558.  \nAt least one automaker is likely to adjust a single pro-\nduction or pricing decision over that period.   \n* * * \nThis case really is this simple:  petitioners make and \nsell liquid fuels.  EPA\u2019s waiver allows California to en-\nforce standards requiring fewer cars that run on liquid \nfuel.  Indeed, California\u2019s goal is to eliminate reliance \non petitioners\u2019 products entirely.  Removing EPA\u2019s \nwaiver would thus likely cause at least a single cus-\ntomer to purchase at least a dollar\u2019s worth more of pe-\ntitioners\u2019 products.  The legality of EPA\u2019s actions may \n\n48 \n \nraise controversial statutory or political questions, but \ntheir justiciability should never have been in doubt.   \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, this Court should  \nreverse the judgment below. \n \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nERIC D.

No such authorization shall be granted \nif the Administrator finds that\u2014 \n(i) the determination of California is arbitrary \nand capricious,  \n(ii) California does not need such California \nstandards to meet compelling and extraordi-\nnary conditions, or  \n(iii) California standards and accompanying \nenforcement procedures are not consistent \nwith this section.  \n(B) Any State other than California which has \nplan provisions approved under part D of sub-\nchapter I may adopt and enforce, after notice to \nthe Administrator, for any period, standards re-\nlating to control of emissions from nonroad vehi-\ncles or engines (other than those referred to in \nsubparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1)) and \ntake such other actions as are referred to in sub-\nparagraph (A) of this paragraph respecting such \nvehicles or engines if\u2014  \n(i) such standards and implementation and en-\nforcement are identical, for the period con-\ncerned, to the California standards authorized \nby the Administrator under subparagraph (A), \nand  \n\n6a \n \n \n(ii) California and such State adopt such stand-\nards at least 2 years before commencement of \nthe period for which the standards take effect.  \nThe Administrator shall issue regulations to \nimplement this subsection.",

These alternative legal and economic theories could be persuasive to the Court. Therefore, the potential to significantly shift my understanding of the strength of the petitioners' case and my ultimate prediction is high (Task EIG). This action also represents a sophisticated strategic step: identifying the dispositive issue from the lower court and specifically seeking out supporting arguments from amici on that point. This is a valuable, repeatable strategy for analyzing cases that turn on a narrow legal doctrine, thus improving the overall prediction methodology (Design EIG).",

Cato\u2019s Robert A. \nLevy Center for Constitutional Studies was estab-\nlished in 1989 to promote the principles of limited con-\nstitutional government that are the foundation of lib-\nerty. Toward those ends, Cato publishes books and \nstudies, conducts conferences, produces the annual \nCato Supreme Court Review, and files amicus briefs.  \nThis case interests Cato because the petitioners \npresented a clear \u201ccase or controversy\u201d when they filed \nthis lawsuit challenging the coercive effect of federal \nand state regulations on their businesses. Yet the \nlower court dismissed the suit, applying a flawed con-\nception of Article III standing that defies common \nsense. Cato has experienced a similar fate, having had \nits own case dismissed by the D.C. Circuit on similar \ngrounds. Cato wishes to highlight lower courts\u2019 misuse \nof standing doctrines to dismiss meritorious, viable \nchallenges to government regulation. This overly strict \ninterpretation of standing doctrine departs from the \nConstitution\u2019s original meaning and should be put to \nan end. \n \n \n \n \n \n1 Rule 37 statement: No part of this brief was authored by any \nparty\u2019s counsel, and no person or entity other than amicus funded \nits preparation or submission. \n\n2 \n \n \nINTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF \nARGUMENT \nDecades ago, Congress granted California special \nstatus under the Clean Air Act to remedy environmen-\ntal concerns unique to California, such as high smog \nlevels in the Los Angeles Basin. Pet. Br. 2. However, \nthe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has \ngiven California excessive latitude\u2014via regulatory \nwaiver from federal law\u2014to pass a series of regula-\ntions intended to reduce fuel emissions and the \namount of fuel used in the state. Because a high per-\ncentage of automobile and fuel products are sold in \nCalifornia, these state regulations will have a national \nand global impact on the economy.  \nDiamond Alternative Energy and other producers \nof liquid fuel (and raw materials for liquid fuel) sued \nto block enforcement of and set aside an EPA waiver. \nThe fuel producers filed declarations explaining that \nCalifornia\u2019s strict automobile emissions regulations \nwould cause fewer fuel-producing cars to be sold, de-\npressing fuel sales and harming them financially. \nHowever, the D.C. Circuit concluded that the fuel pro-\nducers had failed to demonstrate that vacating the \nEPA waiver would change auto sales or increase fuel \npurchases. See Pet. Br. 13. Therefore, it held that the \nfuel industry\u2019s claimed injuries were not shown to be \nredressable and that they lacked standing to sue. Id. \nat 23a.  \nThe decision below demonstrates that lower courts\u2019 \napplication of standing doctrine too often has strayed \nunacceptably from this Court\u2019s precedents and from \nthe original meaning of Article III\u2019s Case or Contro-\nversy Clause. Increasingly, invocations of standing \ndoctrine have become a tool for judicial abdication, \n\n3 \n \n \neven when important rights and issues are at stake. \nStanding has been used as a gating mechanism to \navoid taking up difficult or unpalatable legal chal-\nlenges.  \nIndeed, the Cato Institute recently fell victim to the \nD.C. Circuit\u2019s dubious redressability standards in a \nFirst Amendment case against the Securities and Ex-\nchange Commission (SEC). See Cato Inst. v. SEC, 4 \nF.4th 91, 92 (D.C. Cir. 2021). Many Americans have \nbeen subjected to SEC investigation, and one ap-\nproached Cato about publishing criticisms of the SEC\u2019s \nprosecutorial tactics. Id. at 93. However, the SEC\u2019s \nlongstanding requirement2 that anyone settling an \nSEC investigation must agree to never publicly deny \nthe SEC\u2019s (unproven) allegations prevented Cato from \npublishing its planned manuscript. Id. Cato therefore \nchallenged the SEC\u2019s gag requirement as a violation of \nthe First Amendment rights of the prospective author \nand of Cato as a publisher.  \nBut the district court and D.C. Circuit held that \nCato lacked standing to sue. See id. The D.C. Circuit\u2019s \nperplexing rationale was that Cato\u2019s free speech injury \nwas not redressable. The court speculated that even if \nit declared the SEC gag policy unconstitutional and \nunenforceable, \u201ca [district] court may institute crimi-\nnal contempt proceedings against\u201d Cato\u2019s commis-\nsioned authors \u201cabsent the SEC\u2019s consent.\u201d Id. at 95. \nThis implausible conjecture\u2014that a district court \nwould enforce an unconstitutional, defunct policy\u2014\n \n2 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 202.5. \n\n4 \n \n \nsignals that some lower courts are misapplying the \npurpose and demands of standing doctrine.   \nIn much the same way, the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision \nbelow is perplexing and conjectural. The court cited os-\ntensible standing deficiencies, obviating the need to \nevaluate the merits of petitioners\u2019 numerous claimed \ninjuries. Notably, \u201credressability\u201d is only the latest ju-\nrisdictional shield that has blocked review of the EPA\u2019s \ncontested decision shaping the nation\u2019s energy con-\nsumption and car options. \u201c[T]he D.C. Circuit has \navoided the merits of EPA\u2019s interpretation for over 15 \nyears. It has met each challenge to EPA\u2019s waiver de-\ntermination with a different jurisdictional barrier.\u201d \nPet. Br. 3. \nThat liquid fuel producers will suffer harm if the \nEPA waiver remains intact is obvious and predicta-\nble\u2014California policy is intended to depress liquid fuel \nconsumption. The petitioners have presented a legal \n\u201ccase or controversy,\u201d and both sides have spent signif-\nicant time and resources litigating that controversy. A \ndecision setting aside the waiver will mitigate the im-\nminent future harm that liquid fuel producers antici-\npate. Therefore, Article III courts have not just the au-\nthority but the duty to rule on the legality of the EPA\u2019s \nwaiver and California\u2019s regulations.  \nThis Court should reverse and hold that plaintiffs \nlike Diamond Alternative Energy and the other peti-\ntioners in this case have standing to sue. The courts \nbelow misconstrued precedent to search for and find a \nstanding deficiency. The fuel producers are an obvious \nand intended target of California\u2019s onerous fuel regu-\nlations and their injury is redressable. \n\n5 \n \n \nARGUMENT \nI. \nLOWER COURTS STRAIN TO FIND STAND-\nING DEFICIENCIES IN ORDER TO PREMA-\nTURELY DISMISS CASES AND CONTRO-\nVERSIES. \nStanding doctrine provides plaintiffs a threshold to \nmeet to prevent \u201cturning judges into advice column-\nists.\u201d Uzuegbunam v. Preczewski, 592 U.S. 279, 296 \n(2021) (Roberts, C.J., dissenting). Unfortunately, in re-\ncent decades this doctrine has become increasingly \nmuddled and subject to manipulation by the govern-\nment, leaving injured plaintiffs like Diamond Alterna-\ntive Energy no legal remedy for their injuries. \nModern standing doctrine bears little resemblance \nto the historical requirements derived from the Case \nor Controversy Clause of Article III. U.S. CONST. art. \nIII, \u00a7 2, cl. 1. The original understanding of Article III \nset out three conditions for standing: a plaintiff must \n(1) \u201cassert a legal right in a form prescribed by law,\u201d \n(2) not \u201cdeliberately manufacture a lawsuit,\u201d and (3) \n\u201cpresent a legal question that called for interpretation \nby an independent federal judge who was an expert in \nfederal law.\u201d Robert J. Pushaw, Jr., The Court Contin-\nues to Confuse Standing: The Pitfalls of Faux Article \nIII \u201cOriginalism,\u201d 31 GEO. MASON L. REV. 893, 895 \n(2024). For more than 150 years, the courts applied \nthese elements to determine standing. Id.  \nToday\u2019s three-prong standing test\u2014injury in fact, \ncausation, and redressability\u2014originated as a prag-\nmatic judicial reaction to prevent courts from being \noverwhelmed by Americans\u2019 challenges to New Deal \nagencies\u2019 numerous encroachments into private life \nand commerce. See id. at 896; Lujan v. Defs. of \n\n6 \n \n \nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560\u201361 (1992) (summarizing \nthe standing test). The test \u201cwas fashioned out of other \ndoctrinal materials largely through the conscious ef-\nforts of Justices Brandeis and Frankfurter.\u201d Steven L. \nWinter, The Metaphor of Standing and the Problem of \nSelf-Governance, 40 STAN. L. REV. 1371, 1374 (1988). \nThis Court only formalized the three prongs of the \nmodern standing test in the 1970s. See Pushaw, The \nCourt Continues to Confuse Standing, supra, at 897, \n906; Ass\u2019n of Data Processing Serv. Orgs. v. Camp, 397 \nU.S. 150, 152\u201354 (1970) (establishing the \u201cinjury-in-\nfact\u201d requirement); Linda R.S. v. Richard D., 410 U.S. \n614, 617\u201319 (1973) (introducing the \u201ccausation\u201d and \n\u201credressability\u201d prongs). \nTo the extent the modern prongs lead to the same \noutcomes as the original understanding of Article III, \nthey can be relatively innocuous. Unfortunately, how-\never, lower courts have too often used the modern \nprongs as opportunities to find standing deficiencies \nand prematurely dismiss cases.3 Inquiries directed at \nthe single core question, whether a suit presents a \n \n3 Some lower-court opinions have protested that strict barriers to \nstanding are compelled by the Constitution and that neither Con-\ngress nor the courts have discretion to lower them. These argu-\nments are dubious considering the liberal standing requirements \nthat Congress has established in areas like Freedom of Infor-\nmation Act (FOIA) litigation. Courts freely acquiesce to Con-\ngress\u2019s assertion that any citizen has a right to make FOIA re-\nquests for almost any reason, even simple curiosity. See Evan \nTsen Lee & Josephine Mason Ellis, The Standing Doctrine\u2019s Dirty \nLittle Secret, 107 NW. U.L. REV. 169, 173 (2015); 5 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(iii). No injury is required, and neither causation \nnor redressability must be established to have standing to bring \nan action under FOIA. If that is constitutional, then courts in \nmany other areas of the law have applied a far stricter test for \nstanding than the Constitution requires. \n\n7 \n \n \n\u201ccase or controversy,\u201d are too often tossed aside. Stand-\ning has increasingly become a tool for judicial abdica-\ntion, as courts use standing to create procedural road-\nblocks for plaintiffs with genuine injuries. See Pushaw, \nThe Court Continues to Confuse Standing, supra, at \n895.4 By erecting high thresholds for standing, courts \ncan dismiss complaints that do in fact raise a legal case \nor controversy, leaving plaintiffs who have valid \nclaims without a remedy.  \nThe use of standing doctrine to truncate litigation \nhas grown particularly in environmental and regula-\ntory cases. See id. at 894. In these contexts, standing \nrequirements are often used to dismiss claims from in-\ndustries or individuals who will suffer from govern-\nment regulations but whose injuries are characterized \nas indirect or speculative. Even when plaintiffs suffer \nimmediate and direct harm due to government regula-\ntions, they are still too often denied the opportunity to \nhave their claims heard. See id.  \nThese overly strict applications of standing doc-\ntrine are not just inconsistent with the original mean-\ning of the Constitution, they are also inconsistent with \nthis Court\u2019s precedent. This Court\u2019s decision in Depart-\nment of Commerce v. New York makes plain that when \nregulations will have a \u201cpredictable effect,\u201d that effect \ncan establish redressability. 588 U.S. 752, 768 (2019). \nThe D.C. Circuit erred, then, in requiring plaintiffs to \n \n4 The New Deal and Burger Courts used an early version of the \nmodern standing test to deny relief to plaintiffs challenging gov-\nernment power, first to block \u201cbusinesses challenging progressive \nlegislation, then \u201cto foreclose litigation by disadvantaged groups \nattacking conservative statutes.\u201d Tracey E. George & Robert J. \nPushaw Jr., How is Constitutional Law Made?, 100 MICH. L. REV. \n1265, 1274\u201375 (2002). \n\n8 \n \n \nsomehow \u201cprove\u201d that vacatur would increase the \nmanufacture and sales of fuel-consuming vehicles. \nThis Court\u2019s redressability standard permits plaintiffs \nto point to the predictable and likely effects of a legal \nremedy.  \nProperly applied, standing doctrine ensures that \ncourts adjudicate only real-world disputes and that \nthey do not issue advisory opinions. However, the D.C. \nCircuit\u2019s decision in this case illustrates that the doc-\ntrine is too often used as an arbitrary barrier for par-\nties who have genuine grievances. California has been \nexplicit about its desire to reduce the use of fuel \nthrough the passage of emissions regulations. See Ad-\nvanced Clean Cars Program, CAL. AIR RES. BD. (last \nvisited Jan. 26, 2025).5 The primary purpose of these \nregulations is to reduce fuel use in the state. While the \nregulations bind vehicle manufacturers, those manu-\nfacturers are not the sole targets of California\u2019s regu-\nlations. And the current regulations are just the begin-\nning of a scheme to eliminate all gas-powered vehicles \nand depress fuel consumption. Id. (\u201cBy 2035 all new \npassenger cars, trucks and SUVs sold in California \nwill be zero emissions.\u201d). \nCalifornia\u2019s regulations are designed to reduce \nemissions from vehicles, which will, by necessity, re-\nduce fuel consumption. EPA and California\u2019s regula-\ntory bodies have been explicit about the objective of the \nregulations, and they defend them because of their be-\nlief in the close nexus between emissions and climate \nchange. As this Court said in Massachusetts v. EPA, \n\u201cEPA would presumably not bother with such efforts if \n \n5 Available at https://tinyurl.com/4xtva7nf (last visited Jan. 26, \n2025). \n\n9 \n \n \nit thought emissions reductions would have no discern-\nable impact on future global warming.\u201d 549 U.S. 497, \n526 (2007) (internal quotations omitted). The same \nlogic applies here.  \nPetitioners logically argue that strict emissions \nrules will depress demand for their products, thus \nharming their economic interests as a third party to \nthe EPA\u2019s actions. That should be enough to show a \nredressable injury. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, this Court should re-\nverse the decision of the D.C. Circuit. \n ........................................... Respectfully submitted, \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFebruary 3, 2025 \nThomas A.

Cato\u2019s Robert A. \nLevy Center for Constitutional Studies was estab-\nlished in 1989 to promote the principles of limited con-\nstitutional government that are the foundation of lib-\nerty. Toward those ends, Cato publishes books and \nstudies, conducts conferences, produces the annual \nCato Supreme Court Review, and files amicus briefs.  \nThis case interests Cato because the petitioners \npresented a clear \u201ccase or controversy\u201d when they filed \nthis lawsuit challenging the coercive effect of federal \nand state regulations on their businesses. Yet the \nlower court dismissed the suit, applying a flawed con-\nception of Article III standing that defies common \nsense. Cato has experienced a similar fate, having had \nits own case dismissed by the D.C. Circuit on similar \ngrounds. Cato wishes to highlight lower courts\u2019 misuse \nof standing doctrines to dismiss meritorious, viable \nchallenges to government regulation. This overly strict \ninterpretation of standing doctrine departs from the \nConstitution\u2019s original meaning and should be put to \nan end. \n \n \n \n \n \n1 Rule 37 statement: No part of this brief was authored by any \nparty\u2019s counsel, and no person or entity other than amicus funded \nits preparation or submission. \n\n2 \n \n \nINTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF \nARGUMENT \nDecades ago, Congress granted California special \nstatus under the Clean Air Act to remedy environmen-\ntal concerns unique to California, such as high smog \nlevels in the Los Angeles Basin.

Because a high per-\ncentage of automobile and fuel products are sold in \nCalifornia, these state regulations will have a national \nand global impact on the economy.  \nDiamond Alternative Energy and other producers \nof liquid fuel (and raw materials for liquid fuel) sued \nto block enforcement of and set aside an EPA waiver. \nThe fuel producers filed declarations explaining that \nCalifornia\u2019s strict automobile emissions regulations \nwould cause fewer fuel-producing cars to be sold, de-\npressing fuel sales and harming them financially. \nHowever, the D.C. Circuit concluded that the fuel pro-\nducers had failed to demonstrate that vacating the \nEPA waiver would change auto sales or increase fuel \npurchases. See Pet. Br. 13. Therefore, it held that the \nfuel industry\u2019s claimed injuries were not shown to be \nredressable and that they lacked standing to sue. Id. \nat 23a.  \nThe decision below demonstrates that lower courts\u2019 \napplication of standing doctrine too often has strayed \nunacceptably from this Court\u2019s precedents and from \nthe original meaning of Article III\u2019s Case or Contro-\nversy Clause. Increasingly, invocations of standing \ndoctrine have become a tool for judicial abdication, \n\n3 \n \n \neven when important rights and issues are at stake. \nStanding has been used as a gating mechanism to \navoid taking up difficult or unpalatable legal chal-\nlenges.  \nIndeed, the Cato Institute recently fell victim to the \nD.C. Circuit\u2019s dubious redressability standards in a \nFirst Amendment case against the Securities and Ex-\nchange Commission (SEC). See Cato Inst. v. SEC, 4 \nF.4th 91, 92 (D.C. Cir. 2021). Many Americans have \nbeen subjected to SEC investigation, and one ap-\nproached Cato about publishing criticisms of the SEC\u2019s \nprosecutorial tactics. Id. at 93. However, the SEC\u2019s \nlongstanding requirement2 that anyone settling an \nSEC investigation must agree to never publicly deny \nthe SEC\u2019s (unproven) allegations prevented Cato from \npublishing its planned manuscript. Id. Cato therefore \nchallenged the SEC\u2019s gag requirement as a violation of \nthe First Amendment rights of the prospective author \nand of Cato as a publisher.  \nBut the district court and D.C. Circuit held that \nCato lacked standing to sue. See id. The D.C. Circuit\u2019s \nperplexing rationale was that Cato\u2019s free speech injury \nwas not redressable. The court speculated that even if \nit declared the SEC gag policy unconstitutional and \nunenforceable, \u201ca [district] court may institute crimi-\nnal contempt proceedings against\u201d Cato\u2019s commis-\nsioned authors \u201cabsent the SEC\u2019s consent.\u201d Id. at 95. \nThis implausible conjecture\u2014that a district court \nwould enforce an unconstitutional, defunct policy\u2014\n \n2 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 202.5. \n\n4 \n \n \nsignals that some lower courts are misapplying the \npurpose and demands of standing doctrine.   \nIn much the same way, the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision \nbelow is perplexing and conjectural. The court cited os-\ntensible standing deficiencies, obviating the need to \nevaluate the merits of petitioners\u2019 numerous claimed \ninjuries. Notably, \u201credressability\u201d is only the latest ju-\nrisdictional shield that has blocked review of the EPA\u2019s \ncontested decision shaping the nation\u2019s energy con-\nsumption and car options. \u201c[T]he D.C. Circuit has \navoided the merits of EPA\u2019s interpretation for over 15 \nyears. It has met each challenge to EPA\u2019s waiver de-\ntermination with a different jurisdictional barrier.\u201d \nPet. Br. 3. \nThat liquid fuel producers will suffer harm if the \nEPA waiver remains intact is obvious and predicta-\nble\u2014California policy is intended to depress liquid fuel \nconsumption. The petitioners have presented a legal \n\u201ccase or controversy,\u201d and both sides have spent signif-\nicant time and resources litigating that controversy. A \ndecision setting aside the waiver will mitigate the im-\nminent future harm that liquid fuel producers antici-\npate. Therefore, Article III courts have not just the au-\nthority but the duty to rule on the legality of the EPA\u2019s \nwaiver and California\u2019s regulations.  \nThis Court should reverse and hold that plaintiffs \nlike Diamond Alternative Energy and the other peti-\ntioners in this case have standing to sue. The courts \nbelow misconstrued precedent to search for and find a \nstanding deficiency. The fuel producers are an obvious \nand intended target of California\u2019s onerous fuel regu-\nlations and their injury is redressable. \n\n5 \n \n \nARGUMENT \nI. \nLOWER COURTS STRAIN TO FIND STAND-\nING DEFICIENCIES IN ORDER TO PREMA-\nTURELY DISMISS CASES AND CONTRO-\nVERSIES. \nStanding doctrine provides plaintiffs a threshold to \nmeet to prevent \u201cturning judges into advice column-\nists.\u201d Uzuegbunam v. Preczewski, 592 U.S. 279, 296 \n(2021) (Roberts, C.J., dissenting). Unfortunately, in re-\ncent decades this doctrine has become increasingly \nmuddled and subject to manipulation by the govern-\nment, leaving injured plaintiffs like Diamond Alterna-\ntive Energy no legal remedy for their injuries. \nModern standing doctrine bears little resemblance \nto the historical requirements derived from the Case \nor Controversy Clause of Article III. U.S. CONST. art. \nIII, \u00a7 2, cl. 1. The original understanding of Article III \nset out three conditions for standing: a plaintiff must \n(1) \u201cassert a legal right in a form prescribed by law,\u201d \n(2) not \u201cdeliberately manufacture a lawsuit,\u201d and (3) \n\u201cpresent a legal question that called for interpretation \nby an independent federal judge who was an expert in \nfederal law.\u201d Robert J. Pushaw, Jr., The Court Contin-\nues to Confuse Standing: The Pitfalls of Faux Article \nIII \u201cOriginalism,\u201d 31 GEO. MASON L. REV. 893, 895 \n(2024). For more than 150 years, the courts applied \nthese elements to determine standing. Id.  \nToday\u2019s three-prong standing test\u2014injury in fact, \ncausation, and redressability\u2014originated as a prag-\nmatic judicial reaction to prevent courts from being \noverwhelmed by Americans\u2019 challenges to New Deal \nagencies\u2019 numerous encroachments into private life \nand commerce. See id. at 896; Lujan v. Defs. of \n\n6 \n \n \nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560\u201361 (1992) (summarizing \nthe standing test). The test \u201cwas fashioned out of other \ndoctrinal materials largely through the conscious ef-\nforts of Justices Brandeis and Frankfurter.\u201d Steven L. \nWinter, The Metaphor of Standing and the Problem of \nSelf-Governance, 40 STAN. L. REV. 1371, 1374 (1988). \nThis Court only formalized the three prongs of the \nmodern standing test in the 1970s. See Pushaw, The \nCourt Continues to Confuse Standing, supra, at 897, \n906; Ass\u2019n of Data Processing Serv. Orgs. v. Camp, 397 \nU.S. 150, 152\u201354 (1970) (establishing the \u201cinjury-in-\nfact\u201d requirement); Linda R.S. v. Richard D., 410 U.S. \n614, 617\u201319 (1973) (introducing the \u201ccausation\u201d and \n\u201credressability\u201d prongs). \nTo the extent the modern prongs lead to the same \noutcomes as the original understanding of Article III, \nthey can be relatively innocuous. Unfortunately, how-\never, lower courts have too often used the modern \nprongs as opportunities to find standing deficiencies \nand prematurely dismiss cases.3 Inquiries directed at \nthe single core question, whether a suit presents a \n \n3 Some lower-court opinions have protested that strict barriers to \nstanding are compelled by the Constitution and that neither Con-\ngress nor the courts have discretion to lower them. These argu-\nments are dubious considering the liberal standing requirements \nthat Congress has established in areas like Freedom of Infor-\nmation Act (FOIA) litigation. Courts freely acquiesce to Con-\ngress\u2019s assertion that any citizen has a right to make FOIA re-\nquests for almost any reason, even simple curiosity. See Evan \nTsen Lee & Josephine Mason Ellis, The Standing Doctrine\u2019s Dirty \nLittle Secret, 107 NW. U.L. REV. 169, 173 (2015); 5 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 552(a)(6)(E)(iii). No injury is required, and neither causation \nnor redressability must be established to have standing to bring \nan action under FOIA. If that is constitutional, then courts in \nmany other areas of the law have applied a far stricter test for \nstanding than the Constitution requires. \n\n7 \n \n \n\u201ccase or controversy,\u201d are too often tossed aside. Stand-\ning has increasingly become a tool for judicial abdica-\ntion, as courts use standing to create procedural road-\nblocks for plaintiffs with genuine injuries. See Pushaw, \nThe Court Continues to Confuse Standing, supra, at \n895.4 By erecting high thresholds for standing, courts \ncan dismiss complaints that do in fact raise a legal case \nor controversy, leaving plaintiffs who have valid \nclaims without a remedy.  \nThe use of standing doctrine to truncate litigation \nhas grown particularly in environmental and regula-\ntory cases. See id. at 894. In these contexts, standing \nrequirements are often used to dismiss claims from in-\ndustries or individuals who will suffer from govern-\nment regulations but whose injuries are characterized \nas indirect or speculative. Even when plaintiffs suffer \nimmediate and direct harm due to government regula-\ntions, they are still too often denied the opportunity to \nhave their claims heard. See id.  \nThese overly strict applications of standing doc-\ntrine are not just inconsistent with the original mean-\ning of the Constitution, they are also inconsistent with \nthis Court\u2019s precedent. This Court\u2019s decision in Depart-\nment of Commerce v. New York makes plain that when \nregulations will have a \u201cpredictable effect,\u201d that effect \ncan establish redressability. 588 U.S. 752, 768 (2019). \nThe D.C. Circuit erred, then, in requiring plaintiffs to \n \n4 The New Deal and Burger Courts used an early version of the \nmodern standing test to deny relief to plaintiffs challenging gov-\nernment power, first to block \u201cbusinesses challenging progressive \nlegislation, then \u201cto foreclose litigation by disadvantaged groups \nattacking conservative statutes.\u201d Tracey E. George & Robert J. \nPushaw Jr., How is Constitutional Law Made?, 100 MICH. L. REV. \n1265, 1274\u201375 (2002). \n\n8 \n \n \nsomehow \u201cprove\u201d that vacatur would increase the \nmanufacture and sales of fuel-consuming vehicles. \nThis Court\u2019s redressability standard permits plaintiffs \nto point to the predictable and likely effects of a legal \nremedy.  \nProperly applied, standing doctrine ensures that \ncourts adjudicate only real-world disputes and that \nthey do not issue advisory opinions. However, the D.C. \nCircuit\u2019s decision in this case illustrates that the doc-\ntrine is too often used as an arbitrary barrier for par-\nties who have genuine grievances. California has been \nexplicit about its desire to reduce the use of fuel \nthrough the passage of emissions regulations. See Ad-\nvanced Clean Cars Program, CAL. AIR RES. BD. (last \nvisited Jan. 26, 2025).5 The primary purpose of these \nregulations is to reduce fuel use in the state. While the \nregulations bind vehicle manufacturers, those manu-\nfacturers are not the sole targets of California\u2019s regu-\nlations. And the current regulations are just the begin-\nning of a scheme to eliminate all gas-powered vehicles \nand depress fuel consumption. Id. (\u201cBy 2035 all new \npassenger cars, trucks and SUVs sold in California \nwill be zero emissions.\u201d). \nCalifornia\u2019s regulations are designed to reduce \nemissions from vehicles, which will, by necessity, re-\nduce fuel consumption. EPA and California\u2019s regula-\ntory bodies have been explicit about the objective of the \nregulations, and they defend them because of their be-\nlief in the close nexus between emissions and climate \nchange. As this Court said in Massachusetts v. EPA, \n\u201cEPA would presumably not bother with such efforts if \n \n5 Available at https://tinyurl.com/4xtva7nf (last visited Jan. 26, \n2025). \n\n9 \n \n \nit thought emissions reductions would have no discern-\nable impact on future global warming.\u201d 549 U.S. 497, \n526 (2007) (internal quotations omitted). The same \nlogic applies here.  \nPetitioners logically argue that strict emissions \nrules will depress demand for their products, thus \nharming their economic interests as a third party to \nthe EPA\u2019s actions. That should be enough to show a \nredressable injury. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, this Court should re-\nverse the decision of the D.C. Circuit. \n ........................................... Respectfully submitted, \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFebruary 3, 2025 \nThomas A.

Understanding these counterarguments is crucial for a balanced prediction of how the Supreme Court will weigh the issue. This moves beyond general case facts into the granular legal battle. The Design EIG is also high because this action demonstrates a sophisticated strategy: after identifying the dispositive legal issue, it systematically seeks out the arguments from a specific side (respondents' supporters) using precise filters.

As their case progresses, they \nmust \u201cpoint to factual evidence\u201d establishing that they \nsatisfied the three elements of standing\u2014injury, cau-\nsation, and redressability\u2014as of the time they filed \nsuit.  Murthy v. Missouri, 603 U.S. 43, 57-58 (2024).  \nThe only question here is how to apply those long-set-\ntled requirements to the peculiar circumstances of this \ncase, involving a waiver of preemption under Section \n209(b) of the Clean Air Act. \nAs petitioners describe things, that question is \n\u201cstraightforward\u201d because standing is automatic here.  \nPet. Br. 35.  Petitioners profit from sales of fuel.  They \nnote that the waiver allowed California to impose \nstate standards limiting greenhouse-gas emissions \nacross automakers\u2019 fleets and requiring automakers to \nsell a certain percentage of zero-emission vehicles.  Pe-\ntitioners assert that \u201c[t]hey promptly challenged \nEPA\u2019s waiver,\u201d id. at 20; that the waiver injures peti-\ntioners and their members by \u201creduc[ing] the use of \nliquid fuel,\u201d id.; and that \u201c[s]etting aside EPA\u2019s waiver \nwould . . . end[] the artificial depression of demand for \npetitioners\u2019 products,\u201d id. at 20-21.  Standing was so \n\u201cobvious,\u201d in their view, that they did not \u201cneed to sup-\nply additional record evidence\u201d to establish redressa-\nbility.  Id. at 17, 18. \nBut \u201capplying the law of standing\u201d frequently de-\nmands a \u201cheavily fact-dependent\u201d inquiry, FDA v. All. \nfor Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 384 (2024), and pe-\ntitioners elide the most salient facts in this case.  EPA \ngranted the relevant waiver in 2013.  Petitioners did \nnot challenge that waiver and neither did anyone else.  \nIt remained in effect for more than six years before \n\n \n2 \n \nEPA withdrew it in 2019.  During those six years, in \nresponse to the state standards and wider national \nand global trends, automakers invested heavily in \nchanging their fleets and building consumer demand \nfor electric vehicles.  Consumer preferences and the \nautomobile market evolved.  Even when EPA with-\ndrew the waiver, automakers accelerated their transi-\ntion to electric vehicles and consumer demand \ncontinued to grow. \nIn 2021, when EPA invited comment on whether to \nreinstate the waiver, the state respondents supported \nreinstatement.  As their comment explained, the with-\ndrawal had exceeded EPA\u2019s authority and it deprived \nCalifornia\u2019s regulations of legal effect.  But by the time \nEPA reinstated the waiver and petitioners challenged \nthat decision in 2022, \u201c\u2018both internal sustainability \ngoals and external market forces\u2019\u201d were pushing \n\u201cmanufacturers to transition toward electric vehicles, \nirrespective of California\u2019s regulations.\u201d  Pet. App. 24a \nn.8.  Indeed, publicly available evidence submitted by \nthe state respondents showed that zero-emission vehi-\ncles sold in California in 2022 already exceeded what \nthe relevant standards required.  Consumers were \nwilling to pay substantial price premiums for those ve-\nhicles.  And automakers had strong incentives to keep \nselling them. \nWhen the court of appeals confronted petitioners\u2019 \nchallenge to the reinstatement, it had to assure itself \nof jurisdiction by evaluating whether vacatur of that \nreinstatement would likely lead automakers to make \nchoices that would redress petitioners\u2019 asserted injury.  \nGiven the circumstances when petitioners filed suit in \nMay 2022, would automakers change their fleets or \nprices in a way that would increase demand for peti-\ntioners\u2019 liquid-fuel products?  Or would automakers \n\n \n3 \n \nexceed the requirements of California\u2019s standards for \ntheir own economic and strategic reasons, even with-\nout a legal requirement to do so?  Petitioners submit-\nted no evidence addressing that critical issue.  And \ngiven that absence of proof, the court of appeals \nproperly held that petitioners failed to meet their bur-\nden of demonstrating redressability. \nPetitioners ask this Court to excuse that failure.  \nThey first urge the Court to adopt a new \u201ccategorical \nrule.\u201d  Pet. Br. 4.  Under that rule, redressability \nwould be established automatically whenever peti-\ntioners challenge a regulation that implicates the use \nof their products\u2014even if the regulation applies only \nto third parties, and even where petitioners introduce \nno evidence indicating that those third parties would \nhave acted differently in the regulation\u2019s absence.  Id.  \nIn the alternative, petitioners ask the Court to credit \ntheir unsubstantiated predictions about how au-\ntomakers might respond to a vacatur.  Id. at 30-35.  \nThose arguments find no support in this Court\u2019s prec-\nedent.  Adopting them would effectively eliminate the \nplaintiff\u2019s \u201cburden of showing that third parties will \nlikely react\u201d to a favorable judgment in a way that pro-\nvides redress.  Dep\u2019t of Com. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, \n768 (2019).  And they would allow a court to assume \nredressability even if all the evidence before it indi-\ncates that a favorable judgment would not, in fact, re-\ndress the plaintiffs\u2019 injury.  This Court should reject \npetitioners\u2019 novel standing theories and affirm the \njudgment below. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal and Regulatory Background \n1.  The Clean Air Act directs EPA to prescribe fed-\neral standards governing emissions of air pollutants \n\n \n4 \n \nfrom new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle en-\ngines.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7521.  Section 209(a) of the Act gen-\nerally preempts States and their political subdivisions \nfrom \u201cadopt[ing] or attempt[ing] to enforce any stand-\nard relating to the control of emissions from new mo-\ntor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines.\u201d  Id. \n\u00a7 7543(a).  But Section 209(b) instructs EPA to \u201cwaive \napplication of [Section 209] to any State which ha[d] \nadopted\u201d qualifying emission standards \u201cprior to \nMarch 30, 1966, if the State determines that the State \nstandards will be, in the aggregate, at least as protec-\ntive of public health and welfare as applicable Federal \nstandards.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7543(b)(1).  If a State makes that de-\ntermination, EPA must waive preemption unless it \nmakes one of three enumerated findings.  See id. \n\u00a7 7543(b)(1)(A)-(C). \nCalifornia is the only State eligible for a waiver un-\nder Section 209(b) because it was the only State that \nhad developed qualifying motor vehicle emissions \nstandards before March 30, 1966.  Pet. App. 7a.  \u201cCon-\ngress recognized that California was already the \n\u2018lead[er] in the establishment of standards for regula-\ntion of automative pollutant emissions\u2019 at a time when \nthe federal government had yet to promulgate any reg-\nulations of its own.\u201d  Engine Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 88 \nF.3d 1075, 1079 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  Congress designed \nSection 209 to allow California to continue to serve as \na \u201c\u2018laboratory for innovation,\u2019\u201d id. at 1080, while also \n\u201cavoid[ing] the economic disruption\u201d that would come \nfrom manufacturers \u201chaving to meet fifty-one separate \nsets of emission control requirements,\u201d Motor & \nEquip. Mfrs. Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. EPA, 627 F.2d 1095, 1109 \n(D.C. Cir. 1979); see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7507 (1977 \namendment allowing other States to adopt standards \n\u201cidentical to the California standards for which a \nwaiver has been granted for such model year\u201d); Pet. \n\n \n5 \n \nApp. 9a n.3 (noting that \u201cseventeen states have chosen \nto adopt some portion of the California regulations\u201d). \nCalifornia received its first waiver in 1968 and has \nreceived additional waivers in every subsequent dec-\nade.1  For instance, EPA granted a waiver in 1993 for \nCalifornia\u2019s first Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) regula-\ntion, which required a specific percentage of light-duty \nvehicles to be zero-emission vehicles with no exhaust \nor evaporative emissions.  58 Fed. Reg. 4166 (Jan. 13, \n1993).2  EPA granted another waiver, in 2009, for Cal-\nifornia\u2019s first set of regulations to control greenhouse-\ngas emissions from motor vehicles.  74 Fed. Reg. \n32,744 (July 8, 2009). \n2.  This litigation concerns a set of emissions \nstandards that California adopted in 2012 as part of \nits Advanced Clean Cars I program.  78 Fed. Reg. 2112 \n(Jan. 9, 2013).  As relevant here, those standards in-\ncluded a requirement that automakers reduce the av-\nerage greenhouse-gas emissions across the fleets of \nvehicles they sell in California.  See id. at 2114.  They \nalso included new ZEV standards, requiring manufac-\nturers to meet specified \u201cZEV credit percentage\u201d re-\nquirements.  Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(b) \n(2012).   \nA manufacturer can satisfy the \u201cZEV credit per-\ncentage\u201d in several ways:  by generating credits from \nsales of qualifying vehicles, purchasing credits from \nother manufacturers, using excess credits banked in \nprior years, or applying credits obtained by overcom-\n \n1 See EPA, Vehicle Emissions California Waivers and Authoriza-\ntions, https://tinyurl.com/3rxscztw (last visited Mar. 6, 2025). \n2  See Cal. Air Res. Bd., Low-Emission Vehicle Program,  \nhttps://tinyurl.com/49m28yze (last visited Mar. 6, 2025). \n\n \n6 \n \nplying with the greenhouse-gas emission require-\nments.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(d)(5); 78 \nFed. Reg. at 2119-2120, 2135.  The number of ZEV \ncredits generated by a vehicle sale depends on the ve-\nhicle\u2019s range when operating on electric power.  See \nCal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(d)(5).  For example, a \nplug-in hybrid vehicle with a \u201c50 mile\u201d electric range \nearns one credit, while a fully battery-electric vehicle \nwith a \u201c350 mile\u201d range earns four credits.3  As a re-\nsult, a fleet may satisfy the standards even though \nZEV sales as a percentage of light-duty vehicles sold \nis well below the applicable ZEV credit percentage re-\nquirement.  \nThe Advanced Clean Cars I standards affected \nmodel years beginning in 2017 (for greenhouse-gas \nemissions) and 2018 (for ZEV requirements).  Both \nsets of standards were originally structured to in-\ncrease in stringency through model year 2025 and re-\nmain in effect at 2025 levels for subsequent model \nyears.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1961.3(a)(1)(A) \n(2012); id. \u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2012); J.A. 50.  In 2022, \nhowever, California amended the ZEV standards (but \nnot the greenhouse-gas standards) to expire after \nmodel year 2025.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \n\u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2022).4 \n \n3 78 Fed. Reg. at 2114-2115; see Cal. Air Res. Bd., ACC II ZEV \nTechnology Assessment, at 11-12 tbl. 2 (Apr. 12, 2022) (showing \nelectric ranges of model year 2021 battery and plug-in hybrid ve-\nhicles), https://tinyurl.com/2d2db9vc (last visited Mar. 11, 2025).  \n4  California adopted that amendment because its Advanced \nClean Cars II standards included a new set of ZEV requirements \napplicable to model years 2026 and beyond.  See Cal. Code Regs. \ntit. 13, \u00a7 1962.4(a) (2022).  EPA granted a waiver for the Ad-\nvanced Clean Cars II standards on December 17, 2024.  90 Fed. \n(continued\u2026) \n\n \n7 \n \nCalifornia requested a waiver for the Advanced \nClean Cars I program in 2012.  That request described \nhow the new standards would increase production of \nzero-emission vehicles, thus decreasing emissions of \ncriteria pollutants and greenhouse gases.  J.A. 34-35, \n40-44.  EPA granted the waiver in early 2013.  78 Fed. \nReg. at 2145.  As the Federal Register notice of that \naction observed, petitions for judicial review were due \nby March 11, 2013.  Id.; see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1).  No-\nbody challenged EPA\u2019s decision to grant the waiver. \nMore than six years later, EPA withdrew the parts \nof the waiver at issue in this case.  84 Fed. Reg. 51,310 \n(Sept. 27, 2019).  By that time, automakers had made \n\u201cinvestments to meet\u201d the greenhouse-gas and ZEV \nstandards and \u201chad adjusted their fleets to comply \nwith\u201d them.  Pet. App. 12a; see id. at 124a.  Consumers \nhad grown increasingly familiar with zero-emission \nvehicles.  Even after the waiver was withdrawn, con-\nsumer demand for those vehicles continued to grow \nand automakers continued to announce plans to sell \nthem in greater numbers.  J.A. 191-192, 201-203.  By \n2020, for example, zero-emission vehicles were around \n8% of the new light-duty vehicles registered in Califor-\nnia; that figure jumped to over 12% the following \nyear.5 \nIn 2021, EPA solicited comment on whether it \nshould reinstate the waiver.  The state respondents \nsubmitted a comment in July 2021, explaining that \n \nReg. 642 (2025).  Several challenges to that waiver are now pend-\ning, including one that two of the petitioners here filed on Febru-\nary 28, 2025.  Pet. for Rev., Valero Renewable Fuels Co., LLC v. \nEPA, No. 25-1078 (D.C. Cir.).   \n5 Cal. Energy Comm\u2019n, New ZEV Sales in California, https://ti-\nnyurl.com/pt526fp5 (displaying \u201cZEV Sales Share\u201d in top-right \ncorner when 2020 and 2021 filters are selected). \n\n \n8 \n \nthe withdrawal was unlawful and poorly reasoned.  \nC.A. J.A. 188-215; see J.A. 51-68.  Auto-industry com-\nmenters emphasized the \u201cbillions of dollars of invest-\nment \nin \nelectric \nvehicle \nmanufacturing \nand \ninfrastructure\u201d that automakers had already made as \na result of the 2013 decision to grant the waiver.  J.A. \n103 (National Coalition for Advanced Transportation \ncomment); cf. J.A. 63 (California comment observing \nthat \u201cautomakers have complied with, and often over-\ncomplied with, model years 2017-2020 already\u201d).  EPA \nreinstated the waiver in March 2022.  87 Fed. Reg. \n14,332 (Mar. 14, 2022). \nB. Procedural Background \n1.  The petitioners here are various companies that \nproduce or sell liquid fuels, as well as related trade as-\nsociations.  Pet. App. 2a.  They filed petitions for re-\nview of EPA\u2019s reinstatement decision in the D.C. \nCircuit on May 12, 2022.  Id. at 15a.  The court of ap-\npeals consolidated those cases, along with another \ncase initiated by a group of States led by Ohio.  Id.  \nShortly thereafter, the state respondents here filed an \nunopposed motion for leave to intervene in support of \nEPA, as did various automakers and public-interest \norganizations.  Id. at 15a & nn.4-6; see J.A. 107.  Those \nmotions were granted.  See Pet. App. 15a. \nPetitioners principally argued that EPA\u2019s rein-\nstatement of the waiver contravened the Clean Air \nAct.  Pet. App. 16a.  Before the court of appeals could \nreach the merits of that claim, however, it had to as-\nsure itself of jurisdiction.  Under longstanding circuit \nrules, the opening brief for a petitioner seeking review \nof agency action \u201cmust set forth the basis for the claim \nof standing.\u201d  D.C. Cir. R. 28(a)(7).  And if \u201cstanding is \nnot apparent from the administrative record, the brief \nmust include arguments and evidence establishing the \n\n \n9 \n \nclaim of standing.\u201d  Id.; see also Sierra Club v. EPA, \n292 F.3d 895, 901 (D.C. Cir. 2002). \nPetitioners\u2019 opening brief below devoted just two \nparagraphs to standing.  J.A. 118-119.  Petitioners ex-\nplained that \u201cdepressing the demand\u201d for liquid fuels \n\u201cinjures petitioners and petitioners\u2019 members finan-\ncially.\u201d  Id. at 118.  They cited documents from Cali-\nfornia\u2019s 2011 rulemaking in which a California agency \nhad forecast the p\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n23: 20250312124415114_24-720-20Certificate20of20Service20for20State20Respondents20Brief.json (score: 0.286)\nE-Mail Address: 1115 H Street, NE.\n\nbriefs@wilsonepes.com Washington, D.C. 20002\nWeb Site: \u2018Tel (202) 789-0096\n\n\u2018wwew.willonepes.com Fax (202) 842-4896\nNo. 24-7\n\nDIAMOND ALTERNATIVE ENERGY, LLC, ef al.,\n\nPetitioners,\n\nENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY, ef al.,\nRespondents.\n\nAFFIDAVIT OF SERVICE\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that on March 12, 2025, three (3) copies of the BRIEF FOR THE STATE\nRESPONDENTS in the above-captioned case were served, as required by U.S. Supreme Court\nRule 29.5(c), on the following:\n\nJEFFREY B.

As their case progresses, they \nmust \u201cpoint to factual evidence\u201d establishing that they \nsatisfied the three elements of standing\u2014injury, cau-\nsation, and redressability\u2014as of the time they filed \nsuit.  Murthy v. Missouri, 603 U.S. 43, 57-58 (2024).  \nThe only question here is how to apply those long-set-\ntled requirements to the peculiar circumstances of this \ncase, involving a waiver of preemption under Section \n209(b) of the Clean Air Act. \nAs petitioners describe things, that question is \n\u201cstraightforward\u201d because standing is automatic here.  \nPet. Br. 35.  Petitioners profit from sales of fuel.  They \nnote that the waiver allowed California to impose \nstate standards limiting greenhouse-gas emissions \nacross automakers\u2019 fleets and requiring automakers to \nsell a certain percentage of zero-emission vehicles.  Pe-\ntitioners assert that \u201c[t]hey promptly challenged \nEPA\u2019s waiver,\u201d id. at 20; that the waiver injures peti-\ntioners and their members by \u201creduc[ing] the use of \nliquid fuel,\u201d id.; and that \u201c[s]etting aside EPA\u2019s waiver \nwould . . . end[] the artificial depression of demand for \npetitioners\u2019 products,\u201d id. at 20-21.  Standing was so \n\u201cobvious,\u201d in their view, that they did not \u201cneed to sup-\nply additional record evidence\u201d to establish redressa-\nbility.  Id. at 17, 18. \nBut \u201capplying the law of standing\u201d frequently de-\nmands a \u201cheavily fact-dependent\u201d inquiry, FDA v. All. \nfor Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 384 (2024), and pe-\ntitioners elide the most salient facts in this case.  EPA \ngranted the relevant waiver in 2013.  Petitioners did \nnot challenge that waiver and neither did anyone else.  \nIt remained in effect for more than six years before \n\n \n2 \n \nEPA withdrew it in 2019.  During those six years, in \nresponse to the state standards and wider national \nand global trends, automakers invested heavily in \nchanging their fleets and building consumer demand \nfor electric vehicles.  Consumer preferences and the \nautomobile market evolved.  Even when EPA with-\ndrew the waiver, automakers accelerated their transi-\ntion to electric vehicles and consumer demand \ncontinued to grow. \nIn 2021, when EPA invited comment on whether to \nreinstate the waiver, the state respondents supported \nreinstatement.  As their comment explained, the with-\ndrawal had exceeded EPA\u2019s authority and it deprived \nCalifornia\u2019s regulations of legal effect.  But by the time \nEPA reinstated the waiver and petitioners challenged \nthat decision in 2022, \u201c\u2018both internal sustainability \ngoals and external market forces\u2019\u201d were pushing \n\u201cmanufacturers to transition toward electric vehicles, \nirrespective of California\u2019s regulations.\u201d  Pet. App. 24a \nn.8.  Indeed, publicly available evidence submitted by \nthe state respondents showed that zero-emission vehi-\ncles sold in California in 2022 already exceeded what \nthe relevant standards required.  Consumers were \nwilling to pay substantial price premiums for those ve-\nhicles.  And automakers had strong incentives to keep \nselling them. \nWhen the court of appeals confronted petitioners\u2019 \nchallenge to the reinstatement, it had to assure itself \nof jurisdiction by evaluating whether vacatur of that \nreinstatement would likely lead automakers to make \nchoices that would redress petitioners\u2019 asserted injury.  \nGiven the circumstances when petitioners filed suit in \nMay 2022, would automakers change their fleets or \nprices in a way that would increase demand for peti-\ntioners\u2019 liquid-fuel products?  Or would automakers \n\n \n3 \n \nexceed the requirements of California\u2019s standards for \ntheir own economic and strategic reasons, even with-\nout a legal requirement to do so?  Petitioners submit-\nted no evidence addressing that critical issue.  And \ngiven that absence of proof, the court of appeals \nproperly held that petitioners failed to meet their bur-\nden of demonstrating redressability. \nPetitioners ask this Court to excuse that failure.  \nThey first urge the Court to adopt a new \u201ccategorical \nrule.\u201d  Pet. Br. 4.  Under that rule, redressability \nwould be established automatically whenever peti-\ntioners challenge a regulation that implicates the use \nof their products\u2014even if the regulation applies only \nto third parties, and even where petitioners introduce \nno evidence indicating that those third parties would \nhave acted differently in the regulation\u2019s absence.  Id.  \nIn the alternative, petitioners ask the Court to credit \ntheir unsubstantiated predictions about how au-\ntomakers might respond to a vacatur.  Id. at 30-35.  \nThose arguments find no support in this Court\u2019s prec-\nedent.  Adopting them would effectively eliminate the \nplaintiff\u2019s \u201cburden of showing that third parties will \nlikely react\u201d to a favorable judgment in a way that pro-\nvides redress.  Dep\u2019t of Com. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, \n768 (2019).  And they would allow a court to assume \nredressability even if all the evidence before it indi-\ncates that a favorable judgment would not, in fact, re-\ndress the plaintiffs\u2019 injury.  This Court should reject \npetitioners\u2019 novel standing theories and affirm the \njudgment below. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal and Regulatory Background \n1.  The Clean Air Act directs EPA to prescribe fed-\neral standards governing emissions of air pollutants \n\n \n4 \n \nfrom new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle en-\ngines.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7521.  Section 209(a) of the Act gen-\nerally preempts States and their political subdivisions \nfrom \u201cadopt[ing] or attempt[ing] to enforce any stand-\nard relating to the control of emissions from new mo-\ntor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines.\u201d  Id. \n\u00a7 7543(a).  But Section 209(b) instructs EPA to \u201cwaive \napplication of [Section 209] to any State which ha[d] \nadopted\u201d qualifying emission standards \u201cprior to \nMarch 30, 1966, if the State determines that the State \nstandards will be, in the aggregate, at least as protec-\ntive of public health and welfare as applicable Federal \nstandards.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7543(b)(1).  If a State makes that de-\ntermination, EPA must waive preemption unless it \nmakes one of three enumerated findings.  See id. \n\u00a7 7543(b)(1)(A)-(C). \nCalifornia is the only State eligible for a waiver un-\nder Section 209(b) because it was the only State that \nhad developed qualifying motor vehicle emissions \nstandards before March 30, 1966.  Pet. App. 7a.  \u201cCon-\ngress recognized that California was already the \n\u2018lead[er] in the establishment of standards for regula-\ntion of automative pollutant emissions\u2019 at a time when \nthe federal government had yet to promulgate any reg-\nulations of its own.\u201d  Engine Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 88 \nF.3d 1075, 1079 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  Congress designed \nSection 209 to allow California to continue to serve as \na \u201c\u2018laboratory for innovation,\u2019\u201d id. at 1080, while also \n\u201cavoid[ing] the economic disruption\u201d that would come \nfrom manufacturers \u201chaving to meet fifty-one separate \nsets of emission control requirements,\u201d Motor & \nEquip. Mfrs. Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. EPA, 627 F.2d 1095, 1109 \n(D.C. Cir. 1979); see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7507 (1977 \namendment allowing other States to adopt standards \n\u201cidentical to the California standards for which a \nwaiver has been granted for such model year\u201d); Pet. \n\n \n5 \n \nApp. 9a n.3 (noting that \u201cseventeen states have chosen \nto adopt some portion of the California regulations\u201d). \nCalifornia received its first waiver in 1968 and has \nreceived additional waivers in every subsequent dec-\nade.1  For instance, EPA granted a waiver in 1993 for \nCalifornia\u2019s first Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) regula-\ntion, which required a specific percentage of light-duty \nvehicles to be zero-emission vehicles with no exhaust \nor evaporative emissions.  58 Fed. Reg. 4166 (Jan. 13, \n1993).2  EPA granted another waiver, in 2009, for Cal-\nifornia\u2019s first set of regulations to control greenhouse-\ngas emissions from motor vehicles.  74 Fed. Reg. \n32,744 (July 8, 2009). \n2.  This litigation concerns a set of emissions \nstandards that California adopted in 2012 as part of \nits Advanced Clean Cars I program.  78 Fed. Reg. 2112 \n(Jan. 9, 2013).  As relevant here, those standards in-\ncluded a requirement that automakers reduce the av-\nerage greenhouse-gas emissions across the fleets of \nvehicles they sell in California.  See id. at 2114.  They \nalso included new ZEV standards, requiring manufac-\nturers to meet specified \u201cZEV credit percentage\u201d re-\nquirements.  Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(b) \n(2012).   \nA manufacturer can satisfy the \u201cZEV credit per-\ncentage\u201d in several ways:  by generating credits from \nsales of qualifying vehicles, purchasing credits from \nother manufacturers, using excess credits banked in \nprior years, or applying credits obtained by overcom-\n \n1 See EPA, Vehicle Emissions California Waivers and Authoriza-\ntions, https://tinyurl.com/3rxscztw (last visited Mar. 6, 2025). \n2  See Cal. Air Res. Bd., Low-Emission Vehicle Program,  \nhttps://tinyurl.com/49m28yze (last visited Mar. 6, 2025). \n\n \n6 \n \nplying with the greenhouse-gas emission require-\nments.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(d)(5); 78 \nFed. Reg. at 2119-2120, 2135.  The number of ZEV \ncredits generated by a vehicle sale depends on the ve-\nhicle\u2019s range when operating on electric power.  See \nCal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(d)(5).  For example, a \nplug-in hybrid vehicle with a \u201c50 mile\u201d electric range \nearns one credit, while a fully battery-electric vehicle \nwith a \u201c350 mile\u201d range earns four credits.3  As a re-\nsult, a fleet may satisfy the standards even though \nZEV sales as a percentage of light-duty vehicles sold \nis well below the applicable ZEV credit percentage re-\nquirement.  \nThe Advanced Clean Cars I standards affected \nmodel years beginning in 2017 (for greenhouse-gas \nemissions) and 2018 (for ZEV requirements).  Both \nsets of standards were originally structured to in-\ncrease in stringency through model year 2025 and re-\nmain in effect at 2025 levels for subsequent model \nyears.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1961.3(a)(1)(A) \n(2012); id. \u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2012); J.A. 50.  In 2022, \nhowever, California amended the ZEV standards (but \nnot the greenhouse-gas standards) to expire after \nmodel year 2025.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \n\u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2022).4 \n \n3 78 Fed. Reg. at 2114-2115; see Cal. Air Res. Bd., ACC II ZEV \nTechnology Assessment, at 11-12 tbl. 2 (Apr. 12, 2022) (showing \nelectric ranges of model year 2021 battery and plug-in hybrid ve-\nhicles), https://tinyurl.com/2d2db9vc (last visited Mar. 11, 2025).  \n4  California adopted that amendment because its Advanced \nClean Cars II standards included a new set of ZEV requirements \napplicable to model years 2026 and beyond.  See Cal. Code Regs. \ntit. 13, \u00a7 1962.4(a) (2022).  EPA granted a waiver for the Ad-\nvanced Clean Cars II standards on December 17, 2024.  90 Fed. \n(continued\u2026) \n\n \n7 \n \nCalifornia requested a waiver for the Advanced \nClean Cars I program in 2012.  That request described \nhow the new standards would increase production of \nzero-emission vehicles, thus decreasing emissions of \ncriteria pollutants and greenhouse gases.  J.A. 34-35, \n40-44.  EPA granted the waiver in early 2013.  78 Fed. \nReg. at 2145.  As the Federal Register notice of that \naction observed, petitions for judicial review were due \nby March 11, 2013.  Id.; see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1).  No-\nbody challenged EPA\u2019s decision to grant the waiver. \nMore than six years later, EPA withdrew the parts \nof the waiver at issue in this case.  84 Fed. Reg. 51,310 \n(Sept. 27, 2019).  By that time, automakers had made \n\u201cinvestments to meet\u201d the greenhouse-gas and ZEV \nstandards and \u201chad adjusted their fleets to comply \nwith\u201d them.  Pet. App. 12a; see id. at 124a.  Consumers \nhad grown increasingly familiar with zero-emission \nvehicles.  Even after the waiver was withdrawn, con-\nsumer demand for those vehicles continued to grow \nand automakers continued to announce plans to sell \nthem in greater numbers.  J.A. 191-192, 201-203.  By \n2020, for example, zero-emission vehicles were around \n8% of the new light-duty vehicles registered in Califor-\nnia; that figure jumped to over 12% the following \nyear.5 \nIn 2021, EPA solicited comment on whether it \nshould reinstate the waiver.  The state respondents \nsubmitted a comment in July 2021, explaining that \n \nReg. 642 (2025).  Several challenges to that waiver are now pend-\ning, including one that two of the petitioners here filed on Febru-\nary 28, 2025.  Pet. for Rev., Valero Renewable Fuels Co., LLC v. \nEPA, No. 25-1078 (D.C. Cir.).   \n5 Cal. Energy Comm\u2019n, New ZEV Sales in California, https://ti-\nnyurl.com/pt526fp5 (displaying \u201cZEV Sales Share\u201d in top-right \ncorner when 2020 and 2021 filters are selected). \n\n \n8 \n \nthe withdrawal was unlawful and poorly reasoned.  \nC.A. J.A. 188-215; see J.A. 51-68.  Auto-industry com-\nmenters emphasized the \u201cbillions of dollars of invest-\nment \nin \nelectric \nvehicle \nmanufacturing \nand \ninfrastructure\u201d that automakers had already made as \na result of the 2013 decision to grant the waiver.  J.A. \n103 (National Coalition for Advanced Transportation \ncomment); cf. J.A. 63 (California comment observing \nthat \u201cautomakers have complied with, and often over-\ncomplied with, model years 2017-2020 already\u201d).  EPA \nreinstated the waiver in March 2022.  87 Fed. Reg. \n14,332 (Mar. 14, 2022). \nB. Procedural Background \n1.  The petitioners here are various companies that \nproduce or sell liquid fuels, as well as related trade as-\nsociations.  Pet. App. 2a.  They filed petitions for re-\nview of EPA\u2019s reinstatement decision in the D.C. \nCircuit on May 12, 2022.  Id. at 15a.  The court of ap-\npeals consolidated those cases, along with another \ncase initiated by a group of States led by Ohio.  Id.  \nShortly thereafter, the state respondents here filed an \nunopposed motion for leave to intervene in support of \nEPA, as did various automakers and public-interest \norganizations.  Id. at 15a & nn.4-6; see J.A. 107.  Those \nmotions were granted.  See Pet. App. 15a. \nPetitioners principally argued that EPA\u2019s rein-\nstatement of the waiver contravened the Clean Air \nAct.  Pet. App. 16a.  Before the court of appeals could \nreach the merits of that claim, however, it had to as-\nsure itself of jurisdiction.  Under longstanding circuit \nrules, the opening brief for a petitioner seeking review \nof agency action \u201cmust set forth the basis for the claim \nof standing.\u201d  D.C. Cir. R. 28(a)(7).  And if \u201cstanding is \nnot apparent from the administrative record, the brief \nmust include arguments and evidence establishing the \n\n \n9 \n \nclaim of standing.\u201d  Id.; see also Sierra Club v. EPA, \n292 F.3d 895, 901 (D.C. Cir. 2002). \nPetitioners\u2019 opening brief below devoted just two \nparagraphs to standing.  J.A. 118-119.  Petitioners ex-\nplained that \u201cdepressing the demand\u201d for liquid fuels \n\u201cinjures petitioners and petitioners\u2019 members finan-\ncially.\u201d  Id. at 118.  They cited documents from Cali-\nfornia\u2019s 2011 rulemaking in which a California agency \nhad forecast the prospect of financial injury to oil and \ngas industry participants.  Id. (citing C.A. J.A. 799, \n801, 830, 832).  Petitioners asserted that \u201c[t]his eco-\nnomic injury . . . is caused by the challenged regula-\ntory action, and this Court can redress that injury by \nsetting aside the action.\u201d  J.A. 118.  They attached 14 \ndeclarations, but the only discussion of redressability \nin those declarations consisted of unsupported asser-\ntions that vacatur would remedy petitioners\u2019 injury.  \nId. at 130, 137, 150, 154, 158, 167. \nIn response, the state respondents argued that pe-\ntitioners had failed to establish standing, emphasizing \nthat petitioners provided no evidence that vacatur of \nthe reinstatement decision in May 2022 would change \nautomakers\u2019 behavior in a way that would increase \nfuel sales.  J.A. 185-187.  The state respondents also \nsubmitted evidence undermining the likelihood of any \nsuch change:  by 2022, sales of zero-emission vehicles \nin California exceeded what was required by the rele-\nvant standards; consumer demand for those vehicles \nwas growing, as was consumer willingness to pay price \npremiums; and many manufacturers had announced \nplans for even greater zero-emission vehicle sales in \nthe future.  Id. at 191-195, 201-203.  On reply, peti-\ntioners did not submit record evidence countering the \nstate respondents\u2019 evidence about the circumstances \nin 2022.  See id. at 209-211. \n\n \n10 \n \nAt oral argument, the panel questioned petitioners \nabout jurisdiction, with a particular focus on the \u201car-\ngument that you haven\u2019t demonstrated redressabil-\nity.\u201d  C.A. Oral Arg. 25:50-26:12.  Two weeks later, \npetitioners sought leave to file a supplemental brief \nand to supplement the record with two new declara-\ntions.  Pet. App. 30a.  The proposed brief and declara-\ntions mostly addressed the separate issue of mootness.  \nSee C.A. Private Pet. Proposed Supp. Br. 1-3, 4-13.  In \na short section on standing, petitioners characterized \nthe arguments against redressability as \u201cimplausible\u201d \nand \u201cincredible,\u201d id. at 3, 4\u2014but again cited no evi-\ndence establishing how judicial relief in May 2022 \nwould have redressed their asserted injuries, and did \nnot attempt to counter the state respondents\u2019 evidence \non that point.   \n2.  The court of appeals concluded that it lacked ju-\nrisdiction to decide petitioners\u2019 challenge because pe-\ntitioners had failed to establish Article III standing.  \nPet. App. 16a-19a.  Without deciding whether petition-\ners had established injury or causation, the court ex-\nplained that petitioners fell \u201cfar short of meeting their \nburden\u201d to establish a likelihood \u201cthat their alleged \ninjuries would be redressed\u201d if the court agreed with \npetitioners\u2019 merits theory and vacated EPA\u2019s rein-\nstatement decision.  Id. at 21a. \nAs the court explained, redressability for petition-\ners \u201c\u2018hinge[d] on\u2019 the actions of third parties\u2014the au-\ntomobile manufacturers who are subject to the \nwaiver.\u201d  Pet. App. 22a.  Petitioners needed to show \nthat automakers would respond to vacatur of the rein-\nstatement \u201cby producing and selling fewer non-con-\nventional vehicles or by altering the prices of their \nvehicles such that fewer non-conventional vehicles\u2014\nand more conventional vehicles\u2014were sold.\u201d  Id.  But \n\n \n11 \n \nthe record indicated \u201cthat \u2018manufacturers are already \nselling more qualifying vehicles in California than the \nState\u2019s standards require,\u2019\u201d id. at 28a, and \u201cthat \u2018both \ninternal sustainability goals and external market \nforces\u2019 are prompting manufacturers to transition to-\nward electric vehicles, irrespective of California\u2019s reg-\nulations,\u201d id. at 24a n.8; see also id. at 28a. \nNevertheless, the court of appeals observed, peti-\ntioners \u201ctreated redressability as a foregone conclu-\nsion\u201d instead of making a factual showing.  Pet. App. \n25a.  They did not \u201cattempt[] to explain in any detail \nhow their injuries are redressable, let alone to \u2018cit[e] \nany record evidence\u2019 or to file \u2018additional affidavits or \nother evidence sufficient to support\u2019 redressability.\u201d  \nId. at 24a-25a.  Nor did petitioners \u201cmeaningfully ad-\ndress[]\u201d redressability on reply, after the state re-\nspondents \nintroduced \narguments \nand \nevidence \ncontesting redressability.  Id. at 28a.  \u201cUltimately, the \nrecord evidence, coupled with the filings of the EPA \nand intervenors, provide[d] th[e] Court with no basis \nto conclude that Petitioners\u2019 claims are redressable\u2014\na necessary element of standing that Petitioners bear \nthe burden of establishing.\u201d  Id. at 29a. \nThe court of appeals also described its understand-\ning that the challenge before it \u201cconcern[ed] only\u201d the \nreinstatement of the waiver \u201cas to Model Years 2017 \nthrough 2025.\u201d  Pet. App. 22a.  But see supra p. 6; infra \np. 44.  On that understanding, the court explained, pe-\ntitioners had to show \u201cnot only that automobile man-\nufacturers are likely to respond to a decision by this \nCourt by changing their fleets in a way that alleviates \n[petitioners\u2019] injuries in some way, but also that auto-\nmobile manufacturers would do so relatively quickly\u2014\nby Model Year 2025.\u201d  Pet. App. 23a.  That timing ele-\n\n \n12 \n \nment \u201cfurther complicated\u201d the redressability analy-\nsis,\u201d in the court\u2019s view.  Id. at 22a.  \u201c[E]ven if\u201d peti-\ntioners \nhad \nestablished \nthat \n\u201cautomobile \nmanufacturers were inclined to change course\u201d in re-\nsponse to a vacatur in a way that would increase fuel \nsales, it was \u201cfar from clear that they could do so\u201d by \nmodel year 2025.  Id. at 24a; see id. at 23a. \nFinally, the court of appeals denied petitioners\u2019 \npost-argument motion for leave to file a supplemental \nbrief and declarations.  Pet. App. 30a-32a.  The court \nexplained that, under the circumstances, petitioners \nshould have understood their obligation to address re-\ndressability in their opening brief.  Id. at 31a.  Moreo-\nver, \u201c[p]etitioners offer[ed] no explanation for having \nfailed to address redressability in their reply brief af-\nter California raised the issue in its opposition brief.\u201d  \nId. at 32a. \nPetitioners did not seek panel rehearing or rehear-\ning en banc.  They instead filed a petition for a writ of \ncertiorari respecting both the redressability question \nand the merits of their statutory claim (which the \ncourt of appeals had not reached).  This Court granted \ncertiorari on the redressability question only.6 \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nPetitioners sought a judgment vacating EPA\u2019s re-\ninstatement of a nearly decade-old waiver.  Under set-\ntled precedent, petitioners had the burden of \nestablishing that automakers would likely respond to \n \n6 This Court also denied a petition for certiorari filed by Ohio and \nother petitioners, which advanced a separate constitutional \nclaim.  See Ohio v. EPA, No. 24-13 (Dec. 16, 2024).  The court of \nappeals had held that the Ohio petitioners established standing \nto bring that claim, but it rejected the claim on the merits.  See \nPet. App. 32a-49a. \n\n \n13 \n \nthat vacatur in ways that would increase demand for \npetitioners\u2019 liquid-fuel products.  By the time they \nfiled suit in May 2022, however, the likely effect of a \nvacatur was not self-evident:  in the nine years since \nEPA first granted the waiver, automakers had made \nenormous investments in producing and marketing \nzero-emission vehicles; consumer demand for those ve-\nhicles had recently surged; and evidence before the \nCourt indicated that automakers would continue to \nsell those vehicles in large numbers regardless of the \nreinstatement or its potential vacatur.  Article III re-\nquired petitioners to introduce current evidence but-\ntressing their assertion that a vacatur in 2022 would \nlead automakers to change their fleets or prices in \nways that would increase liquid-fuel sales.  Because \npetitioners did not even attempt to do so, the court of \nappeals properly held that they failed to establish \nstanding. \nIn this Court, petitioners advance several novel \ntheories for why they had no obligation to introduce \nany evidence of redressability.  None of those theories \nis persuasive.  They first propose a categorical rule \nthat redressability is automatically established when-\never a challenged government action implicates the \nuse of the challenger\u2019s products.  Pet. Br. 17-18.  Prec-\nedent forecloses that proposal:  this Court has consist-\nently focused on the particular facts of a case\u2014and \nrequired challengers to submit specific evidence sup-\nporting redressability before obtaining a final judg-\nment.  For similar reasons, plaintiffs may not rely on \nunsupported predictions about the effects of a judg-\nment on a third party\u2019s choices.  See id. at 18.  They \nmust instead meet \u201ctheir burden of showing that third \nparties will likely react in predictable ways\u201d by intro-\nducing actual evidence.  Dep\u2019t of Com. v. New York, \n588 U.S. 752, 768 (2019).  And the fact that a statute \n\n \n14 \n \nor regulation \u201cdoes not sunset\u201d (Pet. Br. 19) does not, \nby itself, establish standing to challenge it. \nFinally, petitioners\u2019 belated attempts to identify \nrecord evidence supporting redressability cannot \nchange the outcome here.  Their briefs and declara-\ntions below were conclusory on the subject of redress-\nability.  The additional evidence they describe in this \nCourt not only comes too late, it would have been in-\nsufficient even if they had presented it below:  it con-\nsists of outdated projections that cannot substitute for \nevidence about the market as it existed when petition-\ners filed this challenge in May 2022. \nARGUMENT \nI. PETITIONERS FAILED TO ESTABLISH REDRESSA-\nBILITY \nPetitioners had the burden to establish standing.  \nAs to redressability, they had to show that judicial va-\ncatur of the reinstatement decision at the time they \nfiled suit in May 2022 would likely lead to increased \nfuel sales.  They failed to carry that burden.   \nA. It Was Petitioners\u2019 Burden to Introduce \nEvidence Establishing Each Element of \nArticle III Standing \nBefore turning to the merits of a suit, a court must \nassure itself of jurisdiction.  Summers v. Earth Island \nInst., 555 U.S. 488, 499 (2009).  The \u201cburden of estab-\nlishing\u201d jurisdiction lies with \u201cthe party asserting ju-\nrisdiction.\u201d  Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., \n511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994) (citing McNutt v. Gen. Motors \nAcceptance Corp. of Ind., 298 U.S. 178, 182-183 \n(1936)). \nStanding is \u201can essential and unchanging part\u201d of \nArticle III jurisdiction.  Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 \n\n \n15 \n \nU.S. 555, 560 (1992).  The doctrine of standing is built \non \u201cthe idea of separation of powers.\u201d  United States v. \nTexas, 599 U.S. 670, 675 (2023).  It \u201cimplements \u2018the \nFramers\u2019 concept of the proper\u2014and properly lim-\nited\u2014role of the courts in a democratic society.\u2019\u201d  FDA \nv. All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 380 (2024) \n(quoting Roberts, Article III Limits on Statutory \nStanding, 42 Duke L.J. 1219, 1220 (1993)). \nThe \u201cirreducible constitutional minimum of stand-\ning contains three elements.\u201d  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560.  \nFirst, the party bringing suit \u201cmust have suffered an \n\u2018injury in fact.\u2019\u201d  Id.  Second, that injury must \u201cbe \n\u2018fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defend-\nant, and not the result of the independent action of \nsome third party not before the court.\u2019\u201d  Id. (altera-\ntions omitted).  And third, \u201cit must be \u2018likely,\u2019 as op-\nposed to merely \u2018speculative,\u2019 that the injury will be \n\u2018redressed by a favorable decision.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 561.  Each \nelement is assessed as of the time the suit commenced.  \nMurthy v. Missouri, 603 U.S. 43, 58 (2024). \nA party seeking to invoke the jurisdiction of a fed-\neral court \u201cmust support each element of standing \n\u2018with the manner and degree of evidence required at \nthe successive stages of the litigation.\u2019\u201d  Murthy, 603 \nU.S. at 58.  At the outset of litigation, \u201c\u2018mere allega-\ntions\u2019\u201d may suffice; as the case progresses, a party \n\u201cmust . . . point to factual evidence.\u201d  Id.  A petitioner \nwho challenges agency action may be able to carry its \nburden by identifying evidence in the administrative \nrecord that establishes its standing.  See, e.g., Sierra \nClub v. EPA, 292 F.3d 895, 899-900 (D.C. Cir. 2002).  \nBut if \u201cstanding is not apparent from the administra-\ntive record,\u201d a petitioner\u2019s \u201cbrief must include argu-\nments and evidence establishing the claim of \nstanding.\u201d  D.C. Cir. R. 28(a)(7); see Sierra Club, 292 \n\n \n16 \n \nF.3d at 900; see generally 15 Redish, Moore\u2019s Federal \nPractice \u00a7\u00a7 101.31, 101.61[10] (3d ed. & Supp. 2025). \nSometimes standing analysis is straightforward.  \nFor instance, in some cases the party invoking the \ncourt\u2019s jurisdiction is itself \u201can object of\u201d the chal-\nlenged government action.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.  \nThe government might, for example, proscribe speech \nthat the plaintiff engages in.  See, e.g., Susan B. An-\nthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 161-167 (2014).  \nOr it might require a state plaintiff to engage in par-\nticular regulation.  See, e.g., West Virginia v. EPA, 597 \nU.S. 697, 718-719 (2022).  In those scenarios, \u201cthere is \nordinarily little question that the action . . . has \ncaused [the plaintiff] injury, and that a judgment pre-\nventing . . . the action will redress\u201d that injury.  Lujan, \n504 U.S. at 561-562; see All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 \nU.S. at 382. \nIn other scenarios, \u201cmuch more is needed.\u201d  Lujan, \n504 U.S. at 562.  When a party\u2019s \u201casserted injury \narises from the government\u2019s allegedly unlawful regu-\nlation . . . of someone else,\u201d for example, standing can \nbe \u201c\u2018substantially more difficult\u2019 to establish.\u201d  Id.  In \nthose cases, \u201ccausation and redressability ordinarily \nhinge on the response of\u201d that third party\u2014\u201cand per-\nhaps on the response of others as well.\u201d  Id.  Because \nthe inquiry turns on \u201cchoices made by independent ac-\ntors not before the courts,\u201d the plaintiff must \u201cadduce \nfacts showing that those choices have been or will be \nmade in such manner as to produce causation and per-\nmit redressability of injury.\u201d  Id.  For instance, if plain-\ntiffs are injured by the lack of affordable private \nhousing, they must show \u201can actionable causal rela-\ntionship\u201d between the challenged zoning ordinance \nand the choices of private third parties who build and \nsell housing.  Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 507 \n\n \n17 \n \n(1975).  Their claim may not proceed if the asserted \ninjury instead results from \u201cthe economics of the area \nhousing market.\u201d  Id. at 506; see generally id. at 508 \n(requiring the party \u201cwho seeks to challenge\u201d a gov-\nernment action to introduce \u201cspecific, concrete facts \ndemonstrating . . . that he personally would benefit in \na tangible way from the court\u2019s intervention\u201d). \nConcrete evidence from the plaintiff is especially \ncritical if another party has introduced evidence un-\ndermining the asserted theory of standing.  \u201cWhen \nchallenged by . . . an opposing party,\u201d for example, a \nplaintiff \u201cinvoking the court\u2019s jurisdiction cannot \nsimply allege a nonobvious harm, without more.\u201d  \nWittman v. Personhuballah, 578 U.S. 539, 545 (2016).  \nAnd if \u201cthere is no \u2018more,\u2019\u201d then there is no jurisdic-\ntion.  Id.; see generally Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U.S. \n77, 96-97 (2010) (when defendants raise facts calling \njurisdiction into doubt, plaintiffs \u201cmust support their \nallegations by competent proof\u201d). \nB. The Circumstances of This Case Raised a \nSerious Question as to Whether Petition-\ners\u2019 Claim Was Redressable \nAs the court of appeals recognized, this is not a case \nwhere standing is self-evident.  Petitioners comprise \ncompanies that produce or refine fuel, companies that \ndevelop biorefining technology, and various trade as-\nsociations (for energy companies, farmers, and con-\nvenience store owners).  Pet. Br. II-V, 20.  They claim \nan injury of financial harm from reduced fuel sales.  \nId. at 21-22.  But the standards at issue here do not \nregulate fuel production or sales.  Instead, the stand-\nards regulate an activity in which petitioners do not \nparticipate:  automobile sales.  Because petitioners are \nnot directly regulated by the challenged agency action, \n\n \n18 \n \nthey needed to identify evidence showing that au-\ntomakers who are subject to those standards would \nmake choices that would \u201cproduce causation and per-\nmit redressability of injury.\u201d  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 562. \nPetitioners\u2019 theory is that the state emissions \nstandards injure them by effectively requiring au-\ntomakers to sell more \u201cvehicles that use less or no liq-\nuid fuel,\u201d which reduces demand for petitioners\u2019 \nproducts.  Pet. Br. 17.  They posit that their revenues \nwould increase if the standards no longer had legal ef-\nfect, because automakers would then make and sell \nmore cars that run on liquid fuel.  Id. at 24.  That the-\nory would indeed have been \u201cstraightforward\u201d (id. at \n35) if petitioners had promptly sought review follow-\ning EPA\u2019s original approval of the waiver in 2013\u2014as \nthey recently did in challenging the Advanced Clean \nCars II waiver, see supra p. 6 n.4.7 \nIn calendar year 2013, zero-emission vehicles made \nup about 2% of light-duty vehicle sales in California.8  \nTo meet the \u201cminimum ZEV credit percentage\u201d re-\nquirements of the Advanced Clean Cars I standards, \n \n7 Petitioners have suggested that D.C. Circuit precedent prohib-\nited them from challenging the 2013 action because California \ndeemed compliance with federal standards to satisfy the state \nstandards.  See Pet. 8 (citing Chamber of Com. of U.S. v. EPA, \n642 F.3d 192, 206 (D.C. Cir. 2011)); Pet. Br. 8-9.  But California\u2019s \nZEV standards\u2014the main focus of petitioners\u2019 present chal-\nlenge\u2014never contained a \u201cdeemed-to-comply\u201d provision, and \nthus could have been challenged in 2013.  J.A. 59-60 n.14 \n(deemed-to-comply provision \u201conly applies to the [greenhouse-\ngas] standard\u201d). \n8 See Cal. Air Res. Bd., California\u2019s Advanced Clean Cars Mid-\nterm Review, App. B, at B15 fig. 9 (Jan. 18, 2017), https://ti-\nnyurl.com/yrzdx3t4. \n\n \n19 \n \nautomakers needed to grow their zero-emission vehi-\ncle sales many times over:  they would have to meet a \nminimum credit percentage of 4.5% by model year \n2018, rising to 22% by model year 2025.  Cal. Code \nRegs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2012).  Regulators es-\ntimated that meeting that 22% credit requirement \nwould require zero-emission vehicles to comprise \nabout 15% of light-duty new-vehicle sales by 2025.  See \nJ.A. 16, 32; 78 Fed. Reg. 2112, 2119 (Jan. 9, 2013).  Ab-\nsent the new regulatory requirement, there was no \nreason to think automakers would make that shift for \ntheir own independent reasons.  Consumers in 2013 \nwere largely unfamiliar with zero-emission vehicles or \nhad a negative impression of them.9  And automakers \nwarned that \u201cconsumer demand for ZEVs\u201d was so ane-\nmic that they might not even be able to meet the re-\nquirements for model year 2018.  78 Fed. Reg. at 2140.   \nBut petitioner challenged EPA\u2019s reinstatement of \nthe waiver nearly a decade later.  By then, companies \nhad been \u201cmaking investments\u201d for years \u201cin updating \ntheir fleets and growing consumer demand for electric \nvehicles.\u201d  Pet. App. 12a, 14a.

And they had in-\nvested in \u201cconsumer outreach\u201d and \u201ceducation\u201d to \nboost demand.11 \nSome of those investments might have been in re-\nsponse to the California standards\u2014but not all.  \nGlobal demand and industry trends also spurred au-\ntomakers to invest in developing and marketing zero-\nemission vehicles.12  And even during the multi-year \nperiod when California\u2019s waiver was withdrawn, au-\ntomakers had \u201caccelerat[ed their] transition to electri-\nfied vehicles across a wide range of vehicle segments.\u201d  \n86 Fed.

App. 13a-14a.   \nWhatever their cause, automakers\u2019 enormous in-\nvestments in electric vehicles since 2013 resulted in a \ndramatic increase in demand for zero-emission vehi-\ncles between 2020 and 2022.  See J.A. 191 (national \nmarket share of qualifying vehicles \u201calmost tripled\u201d \nacross that two-year period).

Br. 18, 34, 35) in \nMay 2022 that reduced sales of petitioners\u2019 fuel prod-\nucts were caused by the reinstatement of the waiver\u2014\ninstead of market forces and automakers\u2019 prior invest-\nments and plans.  Nor was it obvious that vacatur of \nthe reinstatement would likely affect automakers\u2019 fu-\nture behavior in a way that would redress the asserted \ninjury. \nIndeed, evidence submitted by the state respond-\nents indicated the opposite.  Publicly accessible sales \ndata showed that \u201czero-emission vehicles sold in cal-\nendar year 2022\u201d in California \u201cexceed what [the] \nstandards require.\u201d  J.A. 192.  For that calendar year, \nabout 19% of light-duty vehicles sold in the State qual-\nified as zero-emission vehicles under California\u2019s \nstandards\u2014exceeding the 15% that regulators had \nforecast would be needed for compliance.  Id. at 191-\n192; see supra p. 19.  The lion\u2019s share of those sales \n(16% of total light-duty sales) were battery-electric ve-\nhicles.13   \nThat represented a surge in sales of battery-elec-\ntric vehicles that far outpaced early forecasts.  The \nforecasts had projected that automakers would need \nbattery-electric vehicles to be just 3.7% of total light-\nduty sales by model year 2025 to meet the credit re-\nquirements of the ZEV standards.  J.A. 9.  The unex-\npected consumer shift to battery-electric vehicles \n(rather than plug-in hybrids, as forecasters originally \n \n13\n New \nZEV \nSales \nin \nCalifornia, \nsupra, \nhttps://ti-\nnyurl.com/pt526fp5 (displaying 262,076 \u201cBEV\u201d out of 1,581,844 \nannual light-duty sales when 2022 filter is selected). \n\n \n22 \n \nanticipated) had profound consequences for automak-\ners\u2019 compliance with the Advanced Clean Cars I stand-\nards.  Because battery-electric vehicles can travel \nlonger distances without emitting tailpipe pollutants, \nthey yield the most \u201cZEV credits\u201d for purposes of the \nstandards.  See supra p. 6.  So the fact that 16% of \nlight-duty sales were battery-electric vehicles in 2022 \nyielded a ZEV credit percentage for that year that was \nfar above the highest requirement that the standards \nwould ever impose.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \n\u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2012) (22% ZEV credit requirement \nstarting in model year 2025).  And sales in California \nin 2022 were also exceeding the most stringent re-\nquirements of the fleetwide greenhouse-gas stand-\nards, even for future years, because the battery-\nelectric vehicles also have far lower emissions than \nplug-in hybrids.  See J.A. 7. \nBy May 2022, nine years after EPA first granted a \nwaiver for the Advanced Clean Cars I standards, there \nwas substantial reason to believe that automakers \nwould exceed the standards for their own reasons even \nwithout the reinstatement.  The court of appeals could \nnot \u201cpresume[]\u201d that petitioners\u2019 challenge was re-\ndressable.  Kokkonen, 511 U.S. at 377.  Nor could it \nassume redressability based on petitioners\u2019 \u201cuna-\ndorned speculation.\u201d  Simon v. E. Ky. Welfare Rts. \nOrg., 426 U.S. 26, 44 (1976).  Article III required the \ncourt to ask whether petitioners had \u201cmet their bur-\nden\u201d by introducing evidence demonstrating that au-\ntomakers would \u201clikely react\u201d to a vacatur of the 2022 \nreinstatement in ways that would increase demand for \npetitioners\u2019 products and services.  Dep\u2019t of Com. v. \nNew York, 588 U.S. 752, 768 (2019).   \n\n \n23 \n \nC. Petitioners Did Not Introduce Evidence \nEstablishing Redressability \nPetitioners did not carry their evidentiary burden.  \nIndeed, they submitted virtually no argument or evi-\ndence bearing on the likely effect of a vacatur on the \nmarket as it existed in 2022.   \n1.  Petitioners\u2019 opening brief in the court of appeals \ndevoted one sentence to redressability.  They asserted \nthat their \u201cinjury is caused by the challenged regula-\ntory action, and this Court can redress that injury by \nsetting aside the action.\u201d  J.A. 118.  That single con-\nclusory statement was not supported by any citation \nto evidence in the administrative record or elsewhere.  \nPetitioners attached 14 standing declarations to their \nopening brief.  See J.A. 120-184.  But none of those \ndeclarations was sufficient to carry their burden. \nThe bulk of each declaration described the declar-\nant\u2019s asserted injuries, with details supporting the \n(undisputed) proposition that petitioners and their \nmembers profit from fuel sales.  The declarants had \nalmost nothing to say about the critical question going \nto causation and redressability, which \u201care often \u2018flip \nsides of the same coin.\u2019\u201d  All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 \nU.S. at 380.  That question was whether, in 2022, the \nreinstatement of the waiver or the vacatur of that re-\ninstatement would affect automakers\u2019 choices in a \nmanner leading to changes in fuel sales.   \nOf the declarants who addressed causation, some \nasserted their \u201cunderstand[ing] that California\u2019s \ngreenhouse-gas standards and zero-emission-vehicle \nmandate reduce the demand for fuel in California.\u201d  \nJ.A. 125, 140, 169, 183; see also J.A. 176.  Those asser-\ntions were not accompanied by supporting facts or any \ndiscussion of the circumstances in 2022.  Other declar-\nants invoked statements from California about how \n\n \n24 \n \nthe standards would reduce demand for liquid fuels.  \nId. at 129, 136-137, 148, 153, 157, 166, 173, 180.  Peti-\ntioners now describe those statements as \u201crecent[] \nproject[ions] that the waiver would \u2018reduce emissions \nthrough reductions in fuel production.\u2019\u201d  Pet. Br. 38 \n(citing J.A. 148, 180).  But the projections are not \u201cre-\ncent\u201d at all.  They are from California\u2019s \u201c2012 Waiver \nRequest\u201d\u2014and state rulemaking documents submit-\nted as part of that request\u2014prepared a decade before \nthe challenged reinstatement and petitioners\u2019 suit.  \nJ.A. 148, 180; see also id. at 180 (citing state estimates \nfrom 2011).  Those outdated sources did not establish \nthat any reduced fuel sales in 2022 were caused by the \nwaiver\u2019s reinstatement instead of the dramatic \nchanges in the market and consumer demand that \npredated the reinstatement.14  \nThe declarants who addressed redressability did so \nin a single boilerplate sentence asserting that petition-\ners\u2019 \u201cinjuries would be substantially ameliorated if \nEPA\u2019s decision were set aside.\u201d  J.A. 130, 137, 150, \n154, 158, 167, 181; see Pet. App. 21a-22a.  Again, not \none of the declarants addressed the state of the market \nin 2022, when petitioners filed their suit.  Nor did they \nsay a word about automakers\u2019 behavior at that time, \nor the economic and other considerations that would \nshape automakers\u2019 response to a judicial vacatur.  See \ngenerally Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Env\u2019t \nServs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 201 (2000) (Scalia, J., \ndissenting) (discussing this Court\u2019s \u201crefus[al] to find \n \n14 One declarant also referenced a 2020 report by a Minnesota \nagency.  J.A. 174; see Pet. Br. 38.  But the national market share \nof qualifying vehicles \u201calmost tripled\u201d between 2020 and 2022.  \nJ.A. 191.  In any event, petitioners\u2019 briefs in the court of appeals \nnever mentioned effects on the Minnesota market as a basis for \nstanding. \n\n \n25 \n \nstanding based on the \u2018conclusory allegations of an af-\nfidavit\u2019\u201d); Lujan v. Nat\u2019l Wildlife Fed\u2019n, 497 U.S. 871, \n898-899 (1990) (\u201cagree[ing]\u201d that an affidavit was \u201cin-\nsufficient to establish [the challenger\u2019s] right to seek \njudicial review\u201d where it was \u201c\u2018conclusory and com-\npletely devoid of specific facts\u2019\u201d with respect to the key \nissue). \nEven after the state respondents submitted their \nown evidence addressing those subjects and undercut-\nting petitioners\u2019 theory of redressability, supra p. 9, \npetitioners did not \u201cmeaningfully address[] the re-\ndressability of their economic injuries in their reply \nbrief[].\u201d  Pet. App. 28a-29a.  Their primary contention \non reply was that the States\u2019 argument \u201cdefies com-\nmon sense.\u201d  J.A. 209.  They also quoted statements \nfrom the state respondents\u2019 July 2021 comment in sup-\nport of the reinstatement.  Id. at 210; see Pet. Br. 38 \n(citing J.A. 66).  Those statements explained why \nEPA\u2019s 2019 decision to revoke the waiver was unjusti-\nfied based on the record EPA had before it in that year, \nsee J.A. 66 (citing 84 Fed. Reg. 51,310, 51,337 (Sept. \n27, 2019)), and then described California\u2019s \u201cdemon-\nstration in its 2012 waiver request,\u201d J.A. 66.  Neither \nstatement could have taken account of the market \ndata showing that zero-emission vehicle sales tripled \nbetween 2020 and mid-2022.  See id. at 191. \nAnd petitioners\u2019 reply (J.A. 208-212) did not mean-\ningfully address that more recent data either\u2014or the \nevidence showing that market penetration of zero-\nemission vehicles in California in 2022 far exceeded \nany current or future requirement of the relevant \nstandards.  Nor did petitioners respond to the evidence \nindicating that automakers would \u201cha[ve] a similar in-\ncentive to engage in\u201d the promotion and sale of zero-\n\n \n26 \n \nemission vehicles even if the standards were not in ef-\nfect.  Clapper v. Amnesty Int\u2019l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 417 \n(2013); see Warth, 422 U.S. at 506 (no standing where \nevidence suggested that plaintiffs\u2019 injury was \u201cthe con-\nsequence of the economics of the . . . market\u201d).15 \nIn short, petitioners\u2019 initial submission relied on \nthe \u201cpossibility, unsubstantiated by allegations of fact, \nthat their situation . . . might improve were the court \nto afford relief.\u201d  Warth, 422 U.S. at 507.  And petition-\ners\u2019 submission on reply neglected their duty to \u201csup-\nport their allegations by competent proof,\u201d once \n\u201cchallenged on allegations of jurisdictional facts.\u201d  \nHertz Corp., 559 U.S. at 96-97.   \n2.  Article III demanded more.  This Court has re-\npeatedly rejected theories of redressability that de-\npend on \u201c\u2018guesswork as to how independent \ndecisionmakers will exercise their judgment\u2019\u201d instead \nof concrete evidence submitted by the party seeking to \ninvoke federal jurisdiction.  Murthy, 603 U.S. at 57; \nsee, e.g., id. at 73-74; Haaland v. Brackeen, 599 U.S. \n255, 293-294 (2023); Lujan, 504 U.S. at 568-571 (plu-\nrality opinion); Simon, 426 U.S. at 42-43.  \u201cA federal \ncourt cannot ignore\u201d a party\u2019s failure to establish re-\ndressability \u201cwithout overstepping its assigned role in \nour system of adjudicating only actual cases and con-\ntroversies.\u201d  Simon, 426 U.S. at 39.  Because petition-\ners did not provide the court of appeals with any facts \nshowing a likelihood that vacating EPA\u2019s 2022 rein-\nstatement would redress their asserted injuries, the \ncourt properly held that it lacked jurisdiction to decide \nthe merits.  Pet. App. 30a. \n \n15 See generally Nat\u2019l Council for Adoption v. Blinken, 4 F.4th \n106, 111-112 (D.C. Cir. 2021) (discussing when standing evidence \nmay be introduced on reply).   \n\n \n27 \n \nNo one can doubt petitioners\u2019 desire to obtain an \nimmediate and definitive judicial resolution of their \nmerits theories.  See Pet. 26-27.  But the requirements \nof Article III often \u201cmean[] that the federal courts de-\ncide some contested legal questions later rather than \nsooner.\u201d  All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 380.  \nThe court of appeals properly adhered to those re-\nquirements here, refusing to reach the merits after pe-\ntitioners forewent any genuine effort to introduce facts \nestablishing a likelihood that vacatur of the 2022 re-\ninstatement would increase demand for their prod-\nucts. \nII. PETITIONERS IDENTIFY NO VALID BASIS FOR RE-\nVERSAL \nHaving failed \u201cto \u2018cit[e] any record evidence\u2019 or to \nfile \u2018additional affidavits or other evidence sufficient to \nsupport\u2019 redressability\u201d in the court below, Pet. App. \n24a-25a, petitioners now ask this Court to hold that \nthey did \u201cnot need to supply additional record evi-\ndence,\u201d Pet. Br. 17.  They advance three theories:  \n(i) that the Court should \u201cadopt [a] categorical rule\u201d \nthat this type of government action \u201calone suffices to \nestablish redressability,\u201d id. at 17, 18; (ii) that redress-\nability follows from the purported \u201cpredictable effects\u201d \nof the 2022 reinstatement on automakers, id. at 18; \nand (iii) that the duration of the challenged waiver, by \nitself, establishes redressability, see id. at 19, 45-47.  \nBut this Court\u2019s precedent forecloses those theories.  \nAnd petitioners\u2019 attempt to argue, in the alternative, \nthat the record contains \u201cplenty [of] evidence\u201d support-\ning redressability (id. at 37) ignores the gulf between \nthe referenced evidence and the question that mat-\ntered:  how automakers would likely have responded \nto a decision vacating the waiver in May 2022.   \n\n \n28 \n \nA. Government Regulations Implicating the \nUse of a Product Do Not Categorically Es-\ntablish Standing for Producers to Sue \nPetitioners first propose a categorical rule that re-\ndressability is automatically established in every chal-\nlenge seeking to \u201cremove a regulatory impediment to \nthe use of petitioners\u2019 products.\u201d  Pet. Br. 17.  They \nnever clarify the scope of the word \u201cimpediment.\u201d  But \nit appears that their rule would cover a flat prohibition \non the use of a product as well as any lesser restriction \nthat allegedly affects or implicates its use.  And the \nrule would apply even where (as here) the record con-\ntains evidence indicating that a favorable judgment \nwould not actually redress the asserted injury.  That \nnovel proposal finds no basis in this Court\u2019s precedent.  \nFor a court to conclude that it has jurisdiction, the \n\u201c\u2018specific facts\u2019\u201d matter\u2014as does the \u201cevidence\u201d sub-\nmitted by the parties.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561. \n1. Petitioners\u2019 proposed rule is at odds \nwith the precedent they invoke \nPetitioners point to Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154 \n(1997), as support for their proposed rule.  Pet. Br. 25-\n26.  That decision reiterated that an injury resulting \nfrom \u201cthe independent action of some third party not \nbefore the court\u201d is insufficient to establish Article III \nstanding.  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 169 (internal quotation \nmarks and emphasis omitted).  It also noted that the \nbar on standing for injuries caused by independent ac-\ntion does not \u201cexclude injury produced by determina-\ntive or coercive effect\u201d of a government action on the \nchoices of a third party.  Id.  Bennett thus confirms the \ncommon-sense proposition that a petitioner is not nec-\nessarily foreclosed from establishing redressability \njust because a third party is \u201cthe very last step in the \n\n \n29 \n \nchain of causation.\u201d  Id.; see also Lujan, 504 U.S. at \n562. \nBut Bennett hardly supports petitioners\u2019 sweeping \ntheory that redressability is automatically established \nwhenever a challenger simply asserts some \u201cregula-\ntory impediment\u201d (Pet. Br. 25) to the use of its product.  \nTo the contrary, the Court\u2019s decision underscores how \nmuch the particular facts of a case matter.  In Bennett, \nranchers and irrigation districts challenged a Fish and \nWildlife Service biological opinion that proposed min-\nimum water levels for a water project.  But a third \nparty (the Bureau of Reclamation) \u201cretain[ed] ulti-\nmate responsibility\u201d for deciding whether to adopt the \nproposal.  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 168.  With respect to \ncausation and redressability, the main question was \nwhether the Bureau would in fact feel constrained to \ndo what the Service suggested.   \nScrutinizing the facts before it, the Court deter-\nmined that\u2014\u201cin reality\u201d\u2014the biological opinion would \nhave a \u201cdeterminative or coercive effect\u201d on the Bu-\nreau\u2019s action.  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 169.  Although the \nopinion was theoretically advisory, the Service had \nacknowledged \u201cthe virtually determinative effect of its \nbiological opinions.\u201d  Id. at 170.  And the Solicitor Gen-\neral conceded that this particular opinion would have \n\u201ca powerful coercive effect\u201d on the Bureau.  Id. at 169.  \nBefore the opinion, the Bureau had operated the water \nproject \u201cin the same manner throughout the 20th cen-\ntury.\u201d  Id. at 170.  But the Bureau had notified the \nService that in the future it \u201cintended to act in accord-\nance with\u201d the recommendations in the Service\u2019s opin-\nion.16  Those facts showed that the opinion (not some \n \n16 Resp. Br., Bennett v. Spear, No. 95-813 (U.S.), 1996 WL 396714, \n(continued\u2026) \n\n \n30 \n \nother motivation) would cause the Bureau to alter its \nbehavior.  And they allowed the Court to hold that pe-\ntitioners\u2019 injury would \u201c\u2018likely\u2019 be redressed\u2014i.e., the \nBureau will not impose [the] water level restrictions\u2014\nif the Biological Opinion is set aside.\u201d  Bennett, 520 \nU.S. at 170-171.   \nThe other cases invoked by petitioners featured \nsimilar factual assessments.  In Pierce v. Society of the \nSisters of the Holy Names of Jesus & Mary, 268 U.S. \n510 (1925), the law prohibiting parents from sending \ntheir children to private schools had \u201ccaused the with-\ndrawal from [the plaintiff\u2019s] schools of children who \nwould otherwise continue.\u201d  Id. at 532 (emphasis \nadded).  In CBS, Inc. v. United States, 316 U.S. 407, \n414, 423 (1942), an affidavit from the plaintiff radio \nnetwork made clear that radio stations were in fact \n\u201ccancelling or threatening to cancel their contracts in \norder to conform to\u201d the challenged regulations.  And \nin Northeastern Florida Chapter of Associated General \nContractors v. City of Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656, 668 \n(1993), standing rested on petitioner\u2019s allegation that \nits members \u201cregularly bid on construction contracts\u201d \nand \u201cwould have bid on contracts\u201d unavailable to them \ndue to the challenged program \u201cwere they so able.\u201d  Be-\ncause those allegations \u201cha[d] not been challenged,\u201d \nthe Court \u201cassum[ed] that they [were] true.\u201d  Id. at \n668-669.17   \n \nat *27 n.14 (July 15, 1996); see also id. at *8; Bennett v. Plenert, \n1993 WL 669429, at *3 (D. Or. Nov. 18, 1993). \n17 Because of the nature of the equal protection right at issue in \nNortheastern Florida, the companies did not need to show that \nthird parties would have selected their bids\u2014just that the com-\npanies were unable to compete on an equal basis.  See, e.g., Gratz \nv. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 244, 262 (2003). \n\n \n31 \n \nNone of those cases supports a categorical rule ex-\ncusing anyone who sells a product from the obligation \nto establish redressability when challenging a regula-\ntion implicating the use of that product.  And the pos-\nture of cases like Bennett and CBS only underscores \nthe deficiency of petitioners\u2019 showing here.  The peti-\ntioners in those cases sought to survive a motion to \ndismiss, and therefore had the \u201crelatively modest\u201d \nburden of advancing \u201c\u2018general factual allegations\u2019\u201d on \nthe elements of standing.  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 168, \n171; see CBS, 316 U.S. at 414, 423; cf. Ne. Fla., 508 \nU.S. at 668-669.  Here, petitioners were seeking to ob-\ntain a final judgment.  So they needed to \u201c\u2018set forth\u2019 by \naffidavit or other evidence \u2018specific facts\u2019\u201d demonstrat-\ning that vacatur would likely redress their injury.  \nBennett, 520 U.S. at 168; see Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.  \nNo amount of after-the-fact theorizing can excuse \ntheir failure to do so.   \nFor similar reasons, Energy Future Coalition v. \nEPA, 793 F.3d 141 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (Kavanaugh, J.), \ndoes not establish standing here.  That case involved \nethanol producers who sought to challenge an EPA \nregulation prohibiting automakers from using fuel \ncontaining 30% ethanol when testing new vehicles.  Id. \nat 143-144.  The court of appeals observed that stand-\ning can be shown where judicial relief \u201cwould remove \na regulatory hurdle\u201d to the use of a petitioner\u2019s prod-\nuct.  Id. at 144; see Pet. Br. 4, 13, 28, 29, 36.  But that \nwas the starting point for the court\u2019s analysis\u2014not the \nfinish line.  Unlike the petitioners here, the challeng-\ners in Energy Future submitted a detailed standing \nanalysis, which included an economist\u2019s explanation of \nhow the regulated parties would react to the sought-\n\n \n32 \n \nafter change.18  The court was therefore able to focus \non actual record evidence establishing \u201csubstantial \nreason to think that at least some vehicle manufactur-\ners would use\u201d the fuel in testing if the challenged reg-\nulation were eliminated.  Energy Future, 793 F.3d at \n144; see also id. at 144 (describing comments from \nFord Motor Company).  And the court expressly dis-\ntinguished the case before it from a case (like this one) \nin which studies and other \u201cobjective evidence directly \nundermined petitioners\u2019 theory of standing.\u201d  Id. at \n145 n.2. \n2. Petitioners\u2019 rule would violate basic \nprinciples of Article III standing \nThat focus on the particular circumstances of the \ncase, and the allegations and evidence before the \ncourt, is compelled by core requirements of Article III. \na.  Federal courts may not exercise jurisdiction \nbased on assumptions or speculation.  See, e.g., Clap-\nper, 568 U.S. at 414; Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better \nEnv\u2019t, 523 U.S. 83, 94 (1998).  After the pleading stage, \nthey must assure themselves that standing exists by \nexamining \u201c\u2018specific facts\u2019\u201d and \u201cevidence\u201d introduced \nby the plaintiff.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561; see All. for \nHippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 384 (noting the \u201cheavily \nfact-dependent\u201d nature of the inquiry).  That obliga-\ntion takes on added significance when the circum-\nstances of a case (or evidence submitted by the \nopposing party) create serious doubts about one of the \nelements of standing.  See generally Hertz Corp., 559 \nU.S. at 96-97. \n \n18 See Pet. Br., Energy Future, No. 14-1123, 2014 WL 5035232, at \n*29-41 (D.C. Cir. Oct. 8, 2014). \n\n \n33 \n \nTo be sure, \u201cthe nature and extent of facts that \nmust be\u201d submitted by a party seeking to challenge \ngovernment action \u201cdepends considerably\u201d on the sur-\nrounding circumstances.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.  A \nplaintiff who is directly regulated by the challenged \naction, for example, may only need to submit evidence \nshowing that it is an object of that regulation, and that \nit would engage in activities proscribed by the regula-\ntion if it were allowed to do so.  Supra p. 16.  Similarly, \nif the action prohibits other companies from using the \nplaintiff\u2019s product, causation and redressability may \nfollow from basic evidence that the plaintiff sells the \nproduct and third-party companies would have used it \nabsent the regulation.  See, e.g., Energy Future, 793 \nF.3d at 144. \nBut observations about the ease of satisfying evi-\ndentiary requirements in certain types of cases do not \namount to a categorical legal rule that \u201csuffices to es-\ntablish redressability\u201d absent evidence.  Pet. Br. 17.  \nAs this Court has explained, presumptions run \nagainst jurisdiction\u2014not in favor of it.  See, e.g., Renne \nv. Geary, 501 U.S. 312, 316 (1991) (\u201cWe presume that \nfederal courts lack jurisdiction unless the contrary ap-\npears affirmatively from the record.\u201d (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted)); see also Kokkonen, 511 U.S. at \n377.   \nA court must therefore examine the facts and evi-\ndence to determine whether\u2014\u201cin reality\u201d\u2014a judgment \naddressing a challenged government action would \nlikely redress a plaintiff\u2019s asserted injury.  Bennett, \n520 U.S. at 169.  For example, if a regulation makes it \nunlawful \u201cfor soda manufacturers to use sugar,\u201d En-\nergy Future, 793 F.3d at 144, a plaintiff may establish \nstanding by pointing to the regulation and introducing \n\n \n34 \n \nevidence that it sells sugar and that some sodas con-\ntain sugar.  But not every case will be that \u201csimple\u201d \n(Pet. Br. 47).  If the regulation instead made it unlaw-\nful only for soda manufacturers to sell more than 80% \nof their beverages with sugar, and the administrative \nrecord established that sugar-free sodas already rep-\nresented 30% of the market before the regulation, that \nplaintiff would have to do more to establish redressa-\nbility. \nAs discussed above, petitioners\u2019 case does not re-\nsemble the \u201csimple\u201d scenarios, primarily because no \none challenged EPA\u2019s initial decision to grant a waiver \nin 2013.  In the ensuing decade, automakers made \nenormous investments in zero-emission vehicles and \nconsumer tastes evolved.  By May 2022, it was not at \nall clear that the presence or absence of the Advanced \nClean Cars I standards would have a determinative or \ncoercive effect on the mix of cars sold by automakers.  \nSee supra pp. 20-22.  Market forces and internal goals \nwere pushing automakers to continue their shift to-\nward electric vehicles, regardless of California\u2019s regu-\nlations.  Pet. App. 24a n.8.  Those circumstances \ndemanded actual evidence showing redressability\u2014\nnot unsupported assertions about \u201ccommon sense and \nbasic economics.\u201d  Pet. Br. 30. \nb.  Petitioners\u2019 contrary arguments demonstrate a \nmisunderstanding of this Court\u2019s precedent.  It is true \n(Pet. Br. 27) that redressability involves \u201cthe relation-\nship between \u2018the judicial relief requested\u2019 and the \u2018in-\njury\u2019 suffered.\u201d  California v. Texas, 593 U.S. 659, 671 \n(2021).  But the necessary relationship is lacking \nwhere the plaintiff fails to prove that \u201cdepress[ed] \nmarket demand\u201d for its product in fact \u201cflows from\u201d \n(Pet. Br. 27) the challenged regulation, and that vaca-\ntur would likely lead to increased demand. \n\n \n35 \n \nPetitioners also contend that, \u201c[a]s far as redressa-\nbility is concerned, . . . Article III\u2019s demands are the \nsame whether the plaintiff is directly or indirectly reg-\nulated.\u201d  Pet. Br. 27.  Justice Scalia long ago rejected \nthat notion in an opinion for the Court.  When a plain-\ntiff is not the direct object of the government action it \nchallenges, \u201cstanding is not precluded, but it is ordi-\nnarily \u2018substantially more difficult\u2019 to establish.\u201d  \nLujan, 504 U.S. at 562.  That is because the plaintiff \nmust \u201cadduce facts\u201d creating a likelihood that the \nthird parties who are directly regulated will make \n\u201cchoices . . . in such manner as to produce causation \nand permit redressability of injury.\u201d  Id.  Petitioners \ndid not do so here. \n3. Petitioners\u2019 policy arguments do not \njustify their rule \nPetitioners eventually resort to a series of \u201cpolicy\u201d \narguments.  Pet. Br. 41; see id. at 41-45.  They first \nargue that the decision below effectively \u201crequire[s] \nthe endorsement of a directly regulated third party be-\nfore an indirectly regulated party can sue.\u201d  Id. at 38.  \nThat would be a problem, they contend, because di-\nrectly regulated entities often will be unwilling or un-\nable to assist indirectly affected challengers.  See id. \nat 42.  But the court of appeals did not require peti-\ntioners to \u201cprovid[e] affidavits from automakers\u201d as a \ncondition of standing.  Id. at 38.  The court\u2019s opinion \nshowed a willingness to consider a variety of other ma-\nterials (if identified by the parties), including com-\nments in the administrative record and public \nstatements from industry participants.  See Pet. App. \n23a-24a, 28a.   \nAnd there are a range of evidentiary sources be-\nyond \u201caffidavits from automakers\u201d that bear on how \nautomakers would likely respond to a vacatur in 2022.  \n\n \n36 \n \nThe state respondents gathered facts relevant to \nstanding from public databases, news articles, securi-\nties and court filings, government reports, and corpo-\nrate announcements.  See, e.g., J.A. 190-206.  Just a \nfew days after the oral argument caused petitioners to \ntake the jurisdictional questions seriously, petitioners \nlocated retired auto executives to file supplemental \ndeclarations that purported to speak authoritatively \nabout automakers\u2019 capabilities and practices.  See J.A. \n213, 218.19  In similar contexts, other litigants have \nrelied on a variety of sources.  See, e.g., C.A. Ohio Br. \nAdd. 37-54 (economist\u2019s declaration); Duke Pwr. Co. v. \nCarolina Envt\u2019l Study Grp., Inc., 438 U.S. 59, 75-76 \n(1978) (congressional testimony); Competitive Enter. \nInst. v. FCC, 970 F.3d 372, 383 (D.C. Cir. 2020) (ex-\npert\u2019s analysis); Competitive Enter. Inst. v. NHTSA, \n901 F.2d 107, 117 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (testimony from ad-\nministrative hearing).   \nThe decision below thus does not \u201ccreat[e] artifi-\ncially high evidentiary barriers.\u201d  Pet. Br. 35.  And it \ndoes not obstruct \u201csuits by unregulated plaintiffs who \nare adversely affected by an agency\u2019s regulation of oth-\ners.\u201d  Corner Post, Inc. v. Bd. of Governors of Fed. Rsrv. \nSys., 603 U.S. 799, 826 (2024) (Kavanaugh, J., concur-\nring).  It simply ensures that any such suits are \n \n19 Those declarations are not before this Court because the court \nof appeals held that petitioners failed to establish good cause for \ntheir untimely filing, see Pet. App. 31a-32a, and petitioners did \nnot seek review of that ruling, see Pet. I; State Opp. 14-15.  In any \nevent, the declarants did not account for 2022 market conditions.  \nSee J.A. 213-222.  As to redressability, they merely asserted that \nautomakers \u201clikely would change their production, pricing, \nand/or distribution plans for Model Year 2025\u201d absent Califor-\nnia\u2019s standards.  J.A. 215, 220.  They offered no supporting de-\ntails, and focused instead on the distinct question of how quickly \nautomakers could change their fleets and prices. \n\n \n37 \n \nbrought by plaintiffs who are, in fact, adversely af-\nfected by the challenged action and would benefit from \na favorable decision.     \nNext, petitioners argue that the \u201cdecision below \ncreates troubling incentives for agencies.\u201d  Pet. Br. 43.  \nThey assert that agencies may now \u201ctarget entire in-\ndustries with crippling burdens so long as they act \nthrough a conduit and placate that conduit.\u201d  Id.20  \nAgain, however, a plaintiff whose sales are crippled as \nthe result of an agency action can invoke numerous \nsources to demonstrate a likelihood that vacatur \nwould increase sales.  Nor does this case present any \nvalid concern about \u201cencourag[ing] agencies to act over \nshorter time horizons.\u201d  Pet. Br. 44.  The underlying \nwaiver was granted in 2013 and addressed standards \nthat increased in stringency through model year 2025.  \nAny jurisdictional difficulties petitioners confronted \nresulted primarily from their own choice not to chal-\nlenge the original 2013 action.  See supra p. 18 n.7. \nFinally, petitioners argue that the court of appeals \n\u201ccreate[d] a one-way ratchet in favor of the regulator \nover the regulated\u201d by requiring petitioners to intro-\nduce evidence of standing.  Pet. Br. 44.  They contrast \nthat requirement with the principle that \u201c[a] State will \n \n20 Petitioners note that several automakers entered voluntary \nagreements with California in 2020 to continue producing more \nlow- and zero-emission vehicles.  See Pet. App. 13a-14a.  But that \nwas not a \u201ctroubling\u201d effort by EPA to \u201cinsulate\u201d the \u201centire in-\ndustr[y]\u201d from \u201creview.\u201d  Pet. Br. 43.  And petitioners \nacknowledge that \u201cmany\u201d other automakers did not enter any \nsuch agreement.  Id. at 37.  Nothing prevented petitioners from \nattempting to introduce evidence showing that the non-partici-\npating automakers would likely change their fleets in response to \na vacatur of the reinstatement. \n\n \n38 \n \nalways have \u2018a legitimate interest in the continued en-\nforceability of its own statutes.\u2019\u201d  Id. (quoting Maine v. \nTaylor, 477 U.S. 131, 137 (1986)).  But state plaintiffs \ndo introduce evidence where necessary to show that a \nfavorable judgment would redress their injuries.  See, \ne.g., Dep\u2019t of Com., 588 U.S. at 767-768.  And this \nCourt\u2019s recognition that sovereigns have a protectable \ninterest in effectuating their own statutes hardly \namounts to \u201cbad policy.\u201d  Pet. Br. 41; see Maryland v. \nKing, 567 U.S. 1301, 1303 (2012) (Roberts, C.J., in \nchambers); Maine, 477 U.S. at 137. \nThe more relevant policy consideration is the one \nunderlying Article III:  that federal courts have lim-\nited jurisdiction, and a party seeking to invoke that \njurisdiction must show that its claim falls within those \nlimits.  That policy, which reflects the Framers\u2019 vision \nof the proper role of courts in our democratic system, \nsee All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 380, requires \naffirmance here.   \nB. Unsupported Predictions About the Effect \nof a Judgment on a Third Party Are Insuf-\nficient to Establish Redressability \nPetitioners\u2019 alternative theory for why they did not \nneed to introduce evidence of redressability fails for \nsimilar reasons.  They contend that plaintiffs can es-\ntablish standing simply by asserting that the \u201ceffects \nof the challenged government action on third parties\u201d \nare \u201cpredictable\u201d\u2014and that \u201cno more is needed.\u201d  Pet. \nBr. 18.  The cases petitioners invoke for that argument \nactually demonstrate the opposite.   \nPetitioners portray Department of Commerce as \nholding that unsupported inferences and predictions \nabout \u201cthird-party behavior . . . can suffice\u201d to estab-\nlish standing.  Pet. Br. 30; see id. at 31.  In truth, that \ndecision examined whether the plaintiffs \u201cha[d] met \n\n \n39 \n \ntheir burden of showing that third parties will likely \nreact in predictable ways\u201d to a citizenship question on \nthe 2020 census, and thereby cause harm to the plain-\ntiffs.  Dep\u2019t of Com., 588 U.S. at 768 (emphasis added).  \nThe Court answered that question in the affirmative \nonly after reviewing the district court\u2019s \u201cfindings of \nfact\u201d\u2014based on extensive \u201cevidence\u201d\u2014which \u201cestab-\nlished a sufficient likelihood that the reinstatement of \na citizenship question\u201d would depress census response \nrates.  Id. at 767; see New York v. Dep\u2019t of Com., 351 F. \nSupp. 3d 502, 578-581 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (describing ex-\npert testimony, statistical data, and agency memo-\nranda).  The Court did not rely on \u201cspeculation\u201d or \npredictions alone.  Dep\u2019t of Com., 588 U.S. at 768.21 \nNor can petitioners dismiss the significance of the \nevidence before the Court in Department of Commerce \non the ground that it merely recounted \u201chistorical \npractice.\u201d  Pet. Br. 31.  The plaintiffs in that case did \nnot just reference the result of questions on prior cen-\nsuses.  They introduced detailed evidence that \u201cover-\nwhelmingly support[ed] the conclusion that the \naddition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census \nwill cause a significant net differential decline in self-\nresponse rates among noncitizen households.\u201d  New \nYork, 351 F. Supp. 3d at 578 (emphasis added). \nThe remaining authorities discussed by petitioners \n(Pet. Br. 31) do not advance their theory either.  The \nstanding analysis in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. \n497, 526 (2007), turned on evidence that included \u201cpe-\ntitioners\u2019 uncontested affidavits.\u201d  That evidence \n \n21 See also California, 593 U.S. at 678 (explaining that the plain-\ntiffs in Department of Commerce \u201crelied not only on \u2018the predict-\nable effect of Government action on the decisions of third parties\u2019 \nbut also on comprehensive studies, rather than mere \u2018specula-\ntion\u2019\u201d). \n\n \n40 \n \nshowed that \u201cthe United States transportation sector \nemit[ted] . . .  more than 6% of worldwide carbon diox-\nide emissions,\u201d id. at 524; that there was \u201ca causal con-\nnection between manmade greenhouse gas emissions \nand global warming,\u201d id. at 523, see id. at 525; and \nthat \u201c[a] reduction in domestic emissions\u201d resulting \nfrom the requested relief \u201cwould slow the pace of \nglobal emissions increases,\u201d providing partial redress \nfor petitioners\u2019 undisputed injuries, id. at 526; see id. \nat 522-523.22  In Skyline Wesleyan Church v. Califor-\nnia Department of Managed Health Care, 968 F.3d \n738, 750 (9th Cir. 2020), the plaintiff similarly offered \n\u201cevidence\u201d that regulatory enforcement had caused \nhealth insurers to abandon restrictions on abortion \ncoverage.  Specifically, \u201cseven insurers had offered \nplans with abortion coverage restrictions\u201d consistent \nwith plaintiff\u2019s religious beliefs, then \u201call seven com-\nplied\u201d with a regulator\u2019s warning to stop offering such \nplans.  Id. at 750.  Both decisions thus turned on ac-\ntual evidence, not unsupported predictions. \nPetitioners nonetheless advance a blanket rule \nthat no evidence is required if \u201cthe behavior of third \nparties is predictable rather than speculative.\u201d  Pet. \nBr. 30.  They further contend that only \u201cthree \ncircumstances\u201d exist in which third-party behavior is \nsufficiently speculative to require evidence of redress-\nability:  (i) where a plaintiff\u2019s theory relies on \u201c\u2018coun-\nterintuitive\u2019 assumptions,\u201d  id. at 32 (citing California, \n593 U.S. at 678); (ii) where it relies on an attenuated \n\u201cchain of events,\u201d Pet. Br. 32 (citing All. for Hippo-\ncratic Med., 602 U.S. at 386); and (iii) where the \u201clegal \nimpact of a judicial decision is unclear,\u201d Pet. Br. 33 \n \n22 The Court also accorded a \u201cspecial solicitude\u201d to the state peti-\ntioners, which does not apply to the private petitioners here.  \nMassachusetts, 549 U.S. at 520. \n\n \n41 \n \n(citing Murthy, 603 U.S. at 72-73, Brackeen, 599 U.S. \nat 294, and Texas, 599 U.S. at 691 (Gorsuch, J., con-\ncurring in the judgment)). \nThose arguments profoundly misunderstand this \nCourt\u2019s standing doctrine.  Challengers must always \nidentify \u201cevidence\u201d proving \u201c\u2018specific facts\u2019\u201d that estab-\nlish standing.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561; see FW/PBS, \nInc. v. City of Dallas, 493 U.S. 215, 231 (1990).  And \nthis Court\u2019s analysis of standing is \u201cnot a \u2018mechanical \nexercise\u2019\u201d\u2014particularly when it comes to suits (like \nthis one) \u201cby unregulated parties against the govern-\nment.\u201d  All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 384.  In \nsome cases, \u201cfamiliar circumstances\u201d make standing \n\u201clikely,\u201d id., and a plaintiff might be able to meet its \nburden with less evidence.  In other cases, like those \nreferenced by petitioners, the Court has pointed to cir-\ncumstances calling for \u201cfar stronger evidence\u201d of cau-\nsation and redressability.  E.g., California, 593 U.S. at \n678.  But those circumstances are not the only ones in \nwhich plaintiffs are required to introduce any evi-\ndence.  \nPetitioners\u2019 own arguments illustrate the folly of \ntheir proposed rule.  Invoking Summers v. Earth Is-\nland Institute, 555 U.S. 488, 494 (2009), petitioners ar-\ngue (Pet. Br. 34) that \u201cit is predictable that when the \ngovernment \u2018regulates parks, national forests, or bod-\nies of water,\u2019 it will affect the users of those natural \nresources.\u201d  \u201cIn all such cases,\u201d id., petitioners assert, \nno \u201c[r]ecord evidence is required,\u201d id. at 30.  But Sum-\nmers held exactly the opposite.  It reiterated that a \nplaintiff \u201cbears the burden of showing that he has \nstanding.\u201d  Summers, 555 U.S. at 493.  The Court in-\nsisted on particular evidence showing that the chal-\nlenged regulations would affect a specific site that at \nleast one of plaintiffs\u2019 members had \u201ca specific and \n\n \n42 \n \nconcrete plan\u201d to visit.  Id. at 495.  And it rejected a \n\u201chitherto unheard-of test\u201d that would premise stand-\ning on a \u201cprobability\u201d that \u201csome (unidentified) mem-\nbers have planned to visit some (unidentified) small \nparcels affected by the Forest Service\u2019s procedures and \nwill suffer (unidentified) concrete harm as a result.\u201d  \nId. at 497-498.  That sort of predictive approach\u2014un-\nsupported by concrete evidence\u2014would \u201cmake a mock-\nery of\u201d the Court\u2019s \u201cprior cases.\u201d  Id. at 498. \nC. The Duration of the Waiver Does Not, By \nItself, Establish Standing \nPetitioners also contend that they were excused \nfrom submitting evidence because the \u201cwaiver for cer-\ntain California standards does not sunset.\u201d  Pet. Br. \n19.  But the fact that the greenhouse-gas standards \nplateau starting in model year 2025, and continue at \nthe same levels in future years, supra p. 6, does not \nchange the analysis.   \n1.  Petitioners reason that because those standards \n\u201cdo not expire,\u201d a judicial vacatur \u201cwould necessarily \nhave some effect on vehicle pricing, production, or dis-\ntribution at some future point.\u201d  Pet. Br. 46 (emphasis \nadded).  This Court has previously rejected that kind \nof reasoning.  See Summers, 555 U.S. at 496 (state-\nments of \u201c\u2018some day\u2019 intentions,\u201d without \u201cany specifi-\ncation of when the some day will be,\u201d are insufficient \nto establish standing); Lujan, 504 U.S. at 564 (same).  \nAnd for good reason.  Statutes and regulations often \ndo not sunset.  The mere longevity of a challenged reg-\nulation is no substitute for \u201cspecific, concrete facts \ndemonstrating that\u201d the plaintiff is harmed by the \ngovernment\u2019s action and \u201cpersonally would benefit in \na tangible way from the court\u2019s intervention.\u201d  Warth, \n422 U.S. at 508. \n\n \n43 \n \nIn this case, moreover, the facts belie petitioners\u2019 \nassertion (Pet. Br. 19) that the duration of the green-\nhouse-gas standards eliminates any \u201cplausible dis-\npute\u201d about redressability.  By the time of this suit, \nsales of battery-electric vehicles far exceeded original \nforecasts, and those vehicles generate an outsized \nnumber of ZEV credits and produce very few green-\nhouse-gas emissions.  See supra pp. 6, 21-22.  Petition-\ners did not submit any evidence that the market would \nreverse course if those standards were no longer in \nplace in future years.  See supra p. 25. \nNor does the court of appeals\u2019 apparent misunder-\nstanding about the temporal scope of the greenhouse-\ngas standards (Pet. Br. 45) compel a different outcome.  \nThe court of appeals lacked jurisdiction because peti-\ntioners failed to introduce evidence showing that au-\ntomakers would likely respond to vacatur by \u201cselling \nfewer non-conventional vehicles or by altering the \nprices of their vehicles such that fewer non-conven-\ntional vehicles\u2014and more conventional vehicles\u2014\nwere sold.\u201d  Pet. App. 22a; see id. at 29a-30a.  The \ncourt\u2019s belief that the challenge before it \u201cconcern[ed] \nonly\u201d the reinstatement of the waiver \u201cas to Model \nYears 2017 through 2025,\u201d was a consideration that \n\u201cfurther complicated\u201d the redressability analysis.  Id. \nat 22a (emphasis added); see id. at 24a.  Setting aside \nthat additional perceived complication does not make \nup for petitioners\u2019 failure to introduce any evidence ad-\ndressing how automakers would likely respond to a \nvacatur in May 2022.  See U.S. Opp. 12-14. \n2.  Relatedly, petitioners fault EPA and the court \nof appeals for the court\u2019s \u201cincorrect\u201d premise about the \nduration of the waiver, Pet. Br. 45, which they contend \ncaused the court to improperly \u201cconflate[] mootness \n\n \n44 \n \nand redressability,\u201d id. at 39.  Those arguments are \npuzzling. \nIt has never been a secret that California\u2019s \u201cgreen-\nhouse-gas emission standards applied to model year \n2025 \u2018and subsequent.\u2019\u201d  Pet. Br. 45-46 (quoting J.A. \n50).  That was plainly described in the California Code \nof Regulations. See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \n\u00a7 1961.3(a)(1)(A); see also Cal. Code Regs., tit. 13, \n\u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2012) (similar wording in originally \nenacted ZEV provision).  Petitioners imply that the \nlower court\u2019s confusion about the duration of the \nwaiver arose because EPA failed to \u201ccandidly ex-\nplain[]\u201d the matter until the certiorari stage.  Pet. Br. \n45; see id. at 46.  But the more likely culprit was peti-\ntioners\u2019 opening brief below, which told the court that \npetitioners were challenging a program \u201ccover[ing] ve-\nhicles from model years 2015 through 2025.\u201d  C.A. Pri-\nvate Pet. Br. 9; see also C.A. Oral Arg. 33:55-34:13 \n(argument of petitioners\u2019 counsel that, to defeat stand-\ning, \u201cthe Government would need to come forward \nwith some evidence that [automakers have] now \nplanned around the restatement in a way that couldn\u2019t \nbe withdrawn by 2025\u201d). \nThe lack of clarity on this point was perhaps un-\nderstandable:  petitioners\u2019 central focus in this case \nhas always been on the ZEV standards, which will ex-\npire after model year 2025.  Pet. Br. 46.  That may be \nwhy petitioners urged this Court to resolve the merits \nof their statutory claim before \u201cCalifornia\u2019s waiver ex-\npires at the end of model year 2025,\u201d Pet. 26, even af-\nter they had belatedly acknowledged that the \ngreenhouse-gas standards apply to \u201cModel Years \n\u20182025 and subsequent,\u2019\u201d C.A. Private Pet. Proposed \nSupp. Br. 5.  But whatever the source of the confusion \n\n \n45 \n \nbelow, it did not matter to the ultimate outcome.  Re-\ngardless of the waiver\u2019s duration, petitioners failed to \nshow that automakers would respond to its reinstate-\nment (either sooner or later) by making changes that \nwould increase fuel sales.   \nIn the face of that failure, the court of appeals cor-\nrectly explained why its decision was based on stand-\ning, not mootness:  The jurisdictional problem was not \nthat petitioners\u2019 \u201cstanding arguments were sufficient \nwhen originally filed\u201d and then were \u201cmooted by the \npassage of time.\u201d  Pet. App. 25a; see generally Already, \nLLC v. Nike, Inc., 568 U.S. 85, 91 (2013).  Petitioners\u2019 \n\u201cstanding arguments were deficient from the start.\u201d  \nPet. App. 25a.  By the time petitioners filed their chal-\nlenge in May 2022, shifts in consumer demand and \nother transformations in the market made it specula-\ntive (at best) that vacating the reinstatement would \nlead to increased fuel sales in the future.  Petitioners \nnever even attempted to introduce evidence demon-\nstrating that vacatur of the reinstatement would have \nthe effects on automakers that they predicted.  Pet. \nApp. 29a-30a.   \nD. Petitioners\u2019 Post Hoc Attempts to Identify \nEvidence on Redressability Fail to Estab-\nlish Standing \nFinally, petitioners argue that if they \u201cwere legally \nrequired to produce record evidence to support re-\ndressability, plenty such evidence existed.\u201d  Pet. \nBr. 37.  But the few documents that petitioners cited \nin the court of appeals did not establish any likelihood \nthat a vacatur in 2022 would increase fuel sales, as \ndetailed in Part I.C above.  And the additional materi-\nals petitioners now point this Court to would not have \nestablished redressability even if petitioners had in-\nvoked them in a timely fashion below. \n\n \n46 \n \nPetitioners first highlight (Pet. Br. 38) a statement \nfrom an appendix to California\u2019s 2021 comment letter \nregarding the reinstatement.  See J.A. 84.  But that \nstatement relied on forecasts from 2017.  See J.A. 85 \nn.17 (citing January 2017 analysis of regulation com-\npliance scenarios); id. at 85 n.18 (citing February 2017 \nmodeling scenario).  By 2022, the earlier projections \nhad been overtaken by actual events.  See J.A. 191 (na-\ntional market share of zero-emission vehicles \u201calmost \ntripled\u201d in the period \u201cbetween 2020 and the third \nquarter of 2022\u201d). \nPetitioners also invoke declarations that the state \nrespondents filed along with their motion to intervene, \nshortly after petitioners initiated this suit.  See Pet. \nBr. 13, 34.  Those declarations (like petitioners\u2019) as-\nserted a conclusory \u201cexpect[ation]\u201d that additional \ngasoline-fueled vehicles would be sold if California\u2019s \nstandards were not in place.  J.A. 110, 111; see id. at \n115-116.  The lack of any details or contemporaneous \nevidence for those assertions reflected both time con-\nstraints (the intervention declarations were signed \nfour days after the case commenced) and the reality \nthat the States\u2019 standing and entitlement to intervene \nwere independently established for other reasons.  Cf. \nKing, 567 U.S. at 1303 (reasoning that a State suffers \n\u201congoing irreparable harm\u201d any time it \u201cis enjoined by \na court from effectuating . . . a duly enacted statute\u201d). \nAnother document referenced by petitioners (Pet. \nBr. 47) is outside the record and post-dates the deci-\nsion below:  EPA\u2019s recent request for public comment \non its proposal to incorporate the greenhouse-gas \nstandards of the Advanced Clean Cars I program into \nCalifornia\u2019s state implementation plan.  See 89 Fed. \nReg. 82,553 (Oct. 11, 2024); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7407.  To be \nsure, the underlying state estimates referenced in that \n\n \n47 \n \nproposal (see 89 Fed. Reg. at 82,557 & nn.19-20) are \npart of the record, because California submitted them \nto EPA in 2021 in connection with the reinstatement \nproceedings.  See C.A. J.A. 276.  But petitioners never \ninvoked those submissions below.  And the estimates \ntook as their baseline a projection of zero-emission ve-\nhicle penetration based on 2019 data, which did not \nanticipate the dramatic increase in sales in the follow-\ning years.23   \nNone of the materials that petitioners belatedly \nreference could have satisfied their burden to submit \nevidence about how the market would respond to va-\ncatur of the reinstatement in May 2022.  And the fact \nthat they were not \u201cset forth\u201d as \u201cthe basis for the \nclaim of standing\u201d below poses another insuperable \nobstacle for petitioners.  D.C. Cir. R. 28(a)(7).  As this \nCourt recently reminded litigants, \u201c\u2018judges are not like \npigs, hunting for truffles buried in the record.\u2019\u201d  \nMurthy, 603 U.S. at 67 n.7 (alterations omitted).  The \ncourt of appeals could not reasonably be expected to \nfocus on a few sentences scattered across thousands of \npages of record materials, which were never raised in \npetitioners\u2019 briefs.  Nor could it be expected to recall \nisolated assertions in two declarations, filed in support \nof one of five unopposed motions to intervene, that \nwere disposed of by the Clerk more than a year before \noral argument.  See C.A. Order (June 30, 2022). \nIn the end, petitioners are right that this case is \n\u201csimple\u201d (Pet. Br. 47)\u2014but not in the way they sug-\ngest.  They had the burden to introduce evidence es-\ntablishing that their claim was redressable.  Instead \n \n23  See C.A. J.A. 277 (explaining reliance on \u201cEMFAC 2021\u201d \nmodel); Cal. Air Res. Bd., EMFAC 2021 Volume III Technical \nDocument, at 6 (April 2021), https://tinyurl.com/2wsxz4uy (ex-\nplaining use of DMV data through 2019). \n\n \n48 \n \nof meeting that obligation head-on, they treated re-\ndressability as an afterthought\u2014relying on assump-\ntions and conclusory assertions, supplemented only by \noutdated projections.  And when confronted with cur-\nrent evidence from the state respondents undermining \ntheir assumption that vacatur of the reinstatement in \nMay 2022 would lead to increased fuel sales, petition-\ners offered no evidentiary response.  Because petition-\ners failed to introduce specific facts and evidence \nestablishing a likelihood of redressability, the court of \nappeals properly held that it could not reach the mer-\nits. \n\n \n49 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be af-\nfirmed. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \nROB BONTA \nAttorney General of California \nMICHAEL J.

Circuit's standing decision is critical to predicting the Supreme Court's analysis. The information gain is very high as it will directly provide one of the core sets of arguments the Court will evaluate.\n\nFrom a design perspective, this action is also very informative. It demonstrates a sophisticated and efficient strategy: isolating a key legal issue (standing) and then systematically examining the primary brief of a principal party (the respondent) on that issue. Using the `field_filters` to target the 'brief of respondent' is a precise and effective use of the search tool, representing a best practice for legal analysis that is highly generalizable to other cases.

As their case progresses, they \nmust \u201cpoint to factual evidence\u201d establishing that they \nsatisfied the three elements of standing\u2014injury, cau-\nsation, and redressability\u2014as of the time they filed \nsuit.  Murthy v. Missouri, 603 U.S. 43, 57-58 (2024).  \nThe only question here is how to apply those long-set-\ntled requirements to the peculiar circumstances of this \ncase, involving a waiver of preemption under Section \n209(b) of the Clean Air Act. \nAs petitioners describe things, that question is \n\u201cstraightforward\u201d because standing is automatic here.  \nPet. Br. 35.  Petitioners profit from sales of fuel.  They \nnote that the waiver allowed California to impose \nstate standards limiting greenhouse-gas emissions \nacross automakers\u2019 fleets and requiring automakers to \nsell a certain percentage of zero-emission vehicles.  Pe-\ntitioners assert that \u201c[t]hey promptly challenged \nEPA\u2019s waiver,\u201d id. at 20; that the waiver injures peti-\ntioners and their members by \u201creduc[ing] the use of \nliquid fuel,\u201d id.; and that \u201c[s]etting aside EPA\u2019s waiver \nwould . . . end[] the artificial depression of demand for \npetitioners\u2019 products,\u201d id. at 20-21.  Standing was so \n\u201cobvious,\u201d in their view, that they did not \u201cneed to sup-\nply additional record evidence\u201d to establish redressa-\nbility.  Id. at 17, 18. \nBut \u201capplying the law of standing\u201d frequently de-\nmands a \u201cheavily fact-dependent\u201d inquiry, FDA v. All. \nfor Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 384 (2024), and pe-\ntitioners elide the most salient facts in this case.  EPA \ngranted the relevant waiver in 2013.  Petitioners did \nnot challenge that waiver and neither did anyone else.  \nIt remained in effect for more than six years before \n\n \n2 \n \nEPA withdrew it in 2019.  During those six years, in \nresponse to the state standards and wider national \nand global trends, automakers invested heavily in \nchanging their fleets and building consumer demand \nfor electric vehicles.  Consumer preferences and the \nautomobile market evolved.  Even when EPA with-\ndrew the waiver, automakers accelerated their transi-\ntion to electric vehicles and consumer demand \ncontinued to grow. \nIn 2021, when EPA invited comment on whether to \nreinstate the waiver, the state respondents supported \nreinstatement.  As their comment explained, the with-\ndrawal had exceeded EPA\u2019s authority and it deprived \nCalifornia\u2019s regulations of legal effect.  But by the time \nEPA reinstated the waiver and petitioners challenged \nthat decision in 2022, \u201c\u2018both internal sustainability \ngoals and external market forces\u2019\u201d were pushing \n\u201cmanufacturers to transition toward electric vehicles, \nirrespective of California\u2019s regulations.\u201d  Pet. App. 24a \nn.8.  Indeed, publicly available evidence submitted by \nthe state respondents showed that zero-emission vehi-\ncles sold in California in 2022 already exceeded what \nthe relevant standards required.  Consumers were \nwilling to pay substantial price premiums for those ve-\nhicles.  And automakers had strong incentives to keep \nselling them. \nWhen the court of appeals confronted petitioners\u2019 \nchallenge to the reinstatement, it had to assure itself \nof jurisdiction by evaluating whether vacatur of that \nreinstatement would likely lead automakers to make \nchoices that would redress petitioners\u2019 asserted injury.  \nGiven the circumstances when petitioners filed suit in \nMay 2022, would automakers change their fleets or \nprices in a way that would increase demand for peti-\ntioners\u2019 liquid-fuel products?  Or would automakers \n\n \n3 \n \nexceed the requirements of California\u2019s standards for \ntheir own economic and strategic reasons, even with-\nout a legal requirement to do so?  Petitioners submit-\nted no evidence addressing that critical issue.  And \ngiven that absence of proof, the court of appeals \nproperly held that petitioners failed to meet their bur-\nden of demonstrating redressability. \nPetitioners ask this Court to excuse that failure.  \nThey first urge the Court to adopt a new \u201ccategorical \nrule.\u201d  Pet. Br. 4.  Under that rule, redressability \nwould be established automatically whenever peti-\ntioners challenge a regulation that implicates the use \nof their products\u2014even if the regulation applies only \nto third parties, and even where petitioners introduce \nno evidence indicating that those third parties would \nhave acted differently in the regulation\u2019s absence.  Id.  \nIn the alternative, petitioners ask the Court to credit \ntheir unsubstantiated predictions about how au-\ntomakers might respond to a vacatur.  Id. at 30-35.  \nThose arguments find no support in this Court\u2019s prec-\nedent.  Adopting them would effectively eliminate the \nplaintiff\u2019s \u201cburden of showing that third parties will \nlikely react\u201d to a favorable judgment in a way that pro-\nvides redress.  Dep\u2019t of Com. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, \n768 (2019).  And they would allow a court to assume \nredressability even if all the evidence before it indi-\ncates that a favorable judgment would not, in fact, re-\ndress the plaintiffs\u2019 injury.  This Court should reject \npetitioners\u2019 novel standing theories and affirm the \njudgment below. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal and Regulatory Background \n1.  The Clean Air Act directs EPA to prescribe fed-\neral standards governing emissions of air pollutants \n\n \n4 \n \nfrom new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle en-\ngines.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7521.  Section 209(a) of the Act gen-\nerally preempts States and their political subdivisions \nfrom \u201cadopt[ing] or attempt[ing] to enforce any stand-\nard relating to the control of emissions from new mo-\ntor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines.\u201d  Id. \n\u00a7 7543(a).  But Section 209(b) instructs EPA to \u201cwaive \napplication of [Section 209] to any State which ha[d] \nadopted\u201d qualifying emission standards \u201cprior to \nMarch 30, 1966, if the State determines that the State \nstandards will be, in the aggregate, at least as protec-\ntive of public health and welfare as applicable Federal \nstandards.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7543(b)(1).  If a State makes that de-\ntermination, EPA must waive preemption unless it \nmakes one of three enumerated findings.  See id. \n\u00a7 7543(b)(1)(A)-(C). \nCalifornia is the only State eligible for a waiver un-\nder Section 209(b) because it was the only State that \nhad developed qualifying motor vehicle emissions \nstandards before March 30, 1966.  Pet. App. 7a.  \u201cCon-\ngress recognized that California was already the \n\u2018lead[er] in the establishment of standards for regula-\ntion of automative pollutant emissions\u2019 at a time when \nthe federal government had yet to promulgate any reg-\nulations of its own.\u201d  Engine Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 88 \nF.3d 1075, 1079 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  Congress designed \nSection 209 to allow California to continue to serve as \na \u201c\u2018laboratory for innovation,\u2019\u201d id. at 1080, while also \n\u201cavoid[ing] the economic disruption\u201d that would come \nfrom manufacturers \u201chaving to meet fifty-one separate \nsets of emission control requirements,\u201d Motor & \nEquip. Mfrs. Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. EPA, 627 F.2d 1095, 1109 \n(D.C. Cir. 1979); see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7507 (1977 \namendment allowing other States to adopt standards \n\u201cidentical to the California standards for which a \nwaiver has been granted for such model year\u201d); Pet. \n\n \n5 \n \nApp. 9a n.3 (noting that \u201cseventeen states have chosen \nto adopt some portion of the California regulations\u201d). \nCalifornia received its first waiver in 1968 and has \nreceived additional waivers in every subsequent dec-\nade.1  For instance, EPA granted a waiver in 1993 for \nCalifornia\u2019s first Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) regula-\ntion, which required a specific percentage of light-duty \nvehicles to be zero-emission vehicles with no exhaust \nor evaporative emissions.  58 Fed. Reg. 4166 (Jan. 13, \n1993).2  EPA granted another waiver, in 2009, for Cal-\nifornia\u2019s first set of regulations to control greenhouse-\ngas emissions from motor vehicles.  74 Fed. Reg. \n32,744 (July 8, 2009). \n2.  This litigation concerns a set of emissions \nstandards that California adopted in 2012 as part of \nits Advanced Clean Cars I program.  78 Fed. Reg. 2112 \n(Jan. 9, 2013).  As relevant here, those standards in-\ncluded a requirement that automakers reduce the av-\nerage greenhouse-gas emissions across the fleets of \nvehicles they sell in California.  See id. at 2114.  They \nalso included new ZEV standards, requiring manufac-\nturers to meet specified \u201cZEV credit percentage\u201d re-\nquirements.  Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(b) \n(2012).   \nA manufacturer can satisfy the \u201cZEV credit per-\ncentage\u201d in several ways:  by generating credits from \nsales of qualifying vehicles, purchasing credits from \nother manufacturers, using excess credits banked in \nprior years, or applying credits obtained by overcom-\n \n1 See EPA, Vehicle Emissions California Waivers and Authoriza-\ntions, https://tinyurl.com/3rxscztw (last visited Mar. 6, 2025). \n2  See Cal. Air Res. Bd., Low-Emission Vehicle Program,  \nhttps://tinyurl.com/49m28yze (last visited Mar. 6, 2025). \n\n \n6 \n \nplying with the greenhouse-gas emission require-\nments.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(d)(5); 78 \nFed. Reg. at 2119-2120, 2135.  The number of ZEV \ncredits generated by a vehicle sale depends on the ve-\nhicle\u2019s range when operating on electric power.  See \nCal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(d)(5).  For example, a \nplug-in hybrid vehicle with a \u201c50 mile\u201d electric range \nearns one credit, while a fully battery-electric vehicle \nwith a \u201c350 mile\u201d range earns four credits.3  As a re-\nsult, a fleet may satisfy the standards even though \nZEV sales as a percentage of light-duty vehicles sold \nis well below the applicable ZEV credit percentage re-\nquirement.  \nThe Advanced Clean Cars I standards affected \nmodel years beginning in 2017 (for greenhouse-gas \nemissions) and 2018 (for ZEV requirements).  Both \nsets of standards were originally structured to in-\ncrease in stringency through model year 2025 and re-\nmain in effect at 2025 levels for subsequent model \nyears.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1961.3(a)(1)(A) \n(2012); id. \u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2012); J.A. 50.  In 2022, \nhowever, California amended the ZEV standards (but \nnot the greenhouse-gas standards) to expire after \nmodel year 2025.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \n\u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2022).4 \n \n3 78 Fed. Reg. at 2114-2115; see Cal. Air Res. Bd., ACC II ZEV \nTechnology Assessment, at 11-12 tbl. 2 (Apr. 12, 2022) (showing \nelectric ranges of model year 2021 battery and plug-in hybrid ve-\nhicles), https://tinyurl.com/2d2db9vc (last visited Mar. 11, 2025).  \n4  California adopted that amendment because its Advanced \nClean Cars II standards included a new set of ZEV requirements \napplicable to model years 2026 and beyond.  See Cal. Code Regs. \ntit. 13, \u00a7 1962.4(a) (2022).  EPA granted a waiver for the Ad-\nvanced Clean Cars II standards on December 17, 2024.  90 Fed. \n(continued\u2026) \n\n \n7 \n \nCalifornia requested a waiver for the Advanced \nClean Cars I program in 2012.  That request described \nhow the new standards would increase production of \nzero-emission vehicles, thus decreasing emissions of \ncriteria pollutants and greenhouse gases.  J.A. 34-35, \n40-44.  EPA granted the waiver in early 2013.  78 Fed. \nReg. at 2145.  As the Federal Register notice of that \naction observed, petitions for judicial review were due \nby March 11, 2013.  Id.; see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1).  No-\nbody challenged EPA\u2019s decision to grant the waiver. \nMore than six years later, EPA withdrew the parts \nof the waiver at issue in this case.  84 Fed. Reg. 51,310 \n(Sept. 27, 2019).  By that time, automakers had made \n\u201cinvestments to meet\u201d the greenhouse-gas and ZEV \nstandards and \u201chad adjusted their fleets to comply \nwith\u201d them.  Pet. App. 12a; see id. at 124a.  Consumers \nhad grown increasingly familiar with zero-emission \nvehicles.  Even after the waiver was withdrawn, con-\nsumer demand for those vehicles continued to grow \nand automakers continued to announce plans to sell \nthem in greater numbers.  J.A. 191-192, 201-203.  By \n2020, for example, zero-emission vehicles were around \n8% of the new light-duty vehicles registered in Califor-\nnia; that figure jumped to over 12% the following \nyear.5 \nIn 2021, EPA solicited comment on whether it \nshould reinstate the waiver.  The state respondents \nsubmitted a comment in July 2021, explaining that \n \nReg. 642 (2025).  Several challenges to that waiver are now pend-\ning, including one that two of the petitioners here filed on Febru-\nary 28, 2025.

J.A. 188-215; see J.A. 51-68.  Auto-industry com-\nmenters emphasized the \u201cbillions of dollars of invest-\nment \nin \nelectric \nvehicle \nmanufacturing \nand \ninfrastructure\u201d that automakers had already made as \na result of the 2013 decision to grant the waiver.  J.A. \n103 (National Coalition for Advanced Transportation \ncomment); cf. J.A. 63 (California comment observing \nthat \u201cautomakers have complied with, and often over-\ncomplied with, model years 2017-2020 already\u201d).  EPA \nreinstated the waiver in March 2022.  87 Fed. Reg. \n14,332 (Mar. 14, 2022). \nB. Procedural Background \n1.  The petitioners here are various companies that \nproduce or sell liquid fuels, as well as related trade as-\nsociations.  Pet. App. 2a.  They filed petitions for re-\nview of EPA\u2019s reinstatement decision in the D.C. \nCircuit on May 12, 2022.  Id. at 15a.  The court of ap-\npeals consolidated those cases, along with another \ncase initiated by a group of States led by Ohio.  Id.  \nShortly thereafter, the state respondents here filed an \nunopposed motion for leave to intervene in support of \nEPA, as did various automakers and public-interest \norganizations.  Id. at 15a & nn.4-6; see J.A. 107.  Those \nmotions were granted.  See Pet. App. 15a. \nPetitioners principally argued that EPA\u2019s rein-\nstatement of the waiver contravened the Clean Air \nAct.  Pet. App. 16a.  Before the court of appeals could \nreach the merits of that claim, however, it had to as-\nsure itself of jurisdiction.  Under longstanding circuit \nrules, the opening brief for a petitioner seeking review \nof agency action \u201cmust set forth the basis for the claim \nof standing.\u201d  D.C. Cir. R. 28(a)(7).  And if \u201cstanding is \nnot apparent from the administrative record, the brief \nmust include arguments and evidence establishing the \n\n \n9 \n \nclaim of standing.\u201d  Id.; see also Sierra Club v. EPA, \n292 F.3d 895, 901 (D.C. Cir. 2002). \nPetitioners\u2019 opening brief below devoted just two \nparagraphs to standing.  J.A. 118-119.  Petitioners ex-\nplained that \u201cdepressing the demand\u201d for liquid fuels \n\u201cinjures petitioners and petitioners\u2019 members finan-\ncially.\u201d  Id. at 118.

As their case progresses, they \nmust \u201cpoint to factual evidence\u201d establishing that they \nsatisfied the three elements of standing\u2014injury, cau-\nsation, and redressability\u2014as of the time they filed \nsuit.  Murthy v. Missouri, 603 U.S. 43, 57-58 (2024).  \nThe only question here is how to apply those long-set-\ntled requirements to the peculiar circumstances of this \ncase, involving a waiver of preemption under Section \n209(b) of the Clean Air Act. \nAs petitioners describe things, that question is \n\u201cstraightforward\u201d because standing is automatic here.  \nPet. Br. 35.  Petitioners profit from sales of fuel.  They \nnote that the waiver allowed California to impose \nstate standards limiting greenhouse-gas emissions \nacross automakers\u2019 fleets and requiring automakers to \nsell a certain percentage of zero-emission vehicles.  Pe-\ntitioners assert that \u201c[t]hey promptly challenged \nEPA\u2019s waiver,\u201d id. at 20; that the waiver injures peti-\ntioners and their members by \u201creduc[ing] the use of \nliquid fuel,\u201d id.; and that \u201c[s]etting aside EPA\u2019s waiver \nwould . . . end[] the artificial depression of demand for \npetitioners\u2019 products,\u201d id. at 20-21.  Standing was so \n\u201cobvious,\u201d in their view, that they did not \u201cneed to sup-\nply additional record evidence\u201d to establish redressa-\nbility.  Id. at 17, 18. \nBut \u201capplying the law of standing\u201d frequently de-\nmands a \u201cheavily fact-dependent\u201d inquiry, FDA v. All. \nfor Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 384 (2024), and pe-\ntitioners elide the most salient facts in this case.  EPA \ngranted the relevant waiver in 2013.  Petitioners did \nnot challenge that waiver and neither did anyone else.  \nIt remained in effect for more than six years before \n\n \n2 \n \nEPA withdrew it in 2019.  During those six years, in \nresponse to the state standards and wider national \nand global trends, automakers invested heavily in \nchanging their fleets and building consumer demand \nfor electric vehicles.  Consumer preferences and the \nautomobile market evolved.  Even when EPA with-\ndrew the waiver, automakers accelerated their transi-\ntion to electric vehicles and consumer demand \ncontinued to grow. \nIn 2021, when EPA invited comment on whether to \nreinstate the waiver, the state respondents supported \nreinstatement.  As their comment explained, the with-\ndrawal had exceeded EPA\u2019s authority and it deprived \nCalifornia\u2019s regulations of legal effect.  But by the time \nEPA reinstated the waiver and petitioners challenged \nthat decision in 2022, \u201c\u2018both internal sustainability \ngoals and external market forces\u2019\u201d were pushing \n\u201cmanufacturers to transition toward electric vehicles, \nirrespective of California\u2019s regulations.\u201d  Pet. App. 24a \nn.8.  Indeed, publicly available evidence submitted by \nthe state respondents showed that zero-emission vehi-\ncles sold in California in 2022 already exceeded what \nthe relevant standards required.  Consumers were \nwilling to pay substantial price premiums for those ve-\nhicles.  And automakers had strong incentives to keep \nselling them. \nWhen the court of appeals confronted petitioners\u2019 \nchallenge to the reinstatement, it had to assure itself \nof jurisdiction by evaluating whether vacatur of that \nreinstatement would likely lead automakers to make \nchoices that would redress petitioners\u2019 asserted injury.  \nGiven the circumstances when petitioners filed suit in \nMay 2022, would automakers change their fleets or \nprices in a way that would increase demand for peti-\ntioners\u2019 liquid-fuel products?  Or would automakers \n\n \n3 \n \nexceed the requirements of California\u2019s standards for \ntheir own economic and strategic reasons, even with-\nout a legal requirement to do so?  Petitioners submit-\nted no evidence addressing that critical issue.  And \ngiven that absence of proof, the court of appeals \nproperly held that petitioners failed to meet their bur-\nden of demonstrating redressability. \nPetitioners ask this Court to excuse that failure.  \nThey first urge the Court to adopt a new \u201ccategorical \nrule.\u201d  Pet. Br. 4.  Under that rule, redressability \nwould be established automatically whenever peti-\ntioners challenge a regulation that implicates the use \nof their products\u2014even if the regulation applies only \nto third parties, and even where petitioners introduce \nno evidence indicating that those third parties would \nhave acted differently in the regulation\u2019s absence.  Id.  \nIn the alternative, petitioners ask the Court to credit \ntheir unsubstantiated predictions about how au-\ntomakers might respond to a vacatur.  Id. at 30-35.  \nThose arguments find no support in this Court\u2019s prec-\nedent.  Adopting them would effectively eliminate the \nplaintiff\u2019s \u201cburden of showing that third parties will \nlikely react\u201d to a favorable judgment in a way that pro-\nvides redress.  Dep\u2019t of Com. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, \n768 (2019).  And they would allow a court to assume \nredressability even if all the evidence before it indi-\ncates that a favorable judgment would not, in fact, re-\ndress the plaintiffs\u2019 injury.  This Court should reject \npetitioners\u2019 novel standing theories and affirm the \njudgment below. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal and Regulatory Background \n1.  The Clean Air Act directs EPA to prescribe fed-\neral standards governing emissions of air pollutants \n\n \n4 \n \nfrom new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle en-\ngines.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7521.  Section 209(a) of the Act gen-\nerally preempts States and their political subdivisions \nfrom \u201cadopt[ing] or attempt[ing] to enforce any stand-\nard relating to the control of emissions from new mo-\ntor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines.\u201d  Id. \n\u00a7 7543(a).  But Section 209(b) instructs EPA to \u201cwaive \napplication of [Section 209] to any State which ha[d] \nadopted\u201d qualifying emission standards \u201cprior to \nMarch 30, 1966, if the State determines that the State \nstandards will be, in the aggregate, at least as protec-\ntive of public health and welfare as applicable Federal \nstandards.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7543(b)(1).  If a State makes that de-\ntermination, EPA must waive preemption unless it \nmakes one of three enumerated findings.  See id. \n\u00a7 7543(b)(1)(A)-(C). \nCalifornia is the only State eligible for a waiver un-\nder Section 209(b) because it was the only State that \nhad developed qualifying motor vehicle emissions \nstandards before March 30, 1966.  Pet. App. 7a.  \u201cCon-\ngress recognized that California was already the \n\u2018lead[er] in the establishment of standards for regula-\ntion of automative pollutant emissions\u2019 at a time when \nthe federal government had yet to promulgate any reg-\nulations of its own.\u201d  Engine Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 88 \nF.3d 1075, 1079 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  Congress designed \nSection 209 to allow California to continue to serve as \na \u201c\u2018laboratory for innovation,\u2019\u201d id. at 1080, while also \n\u201cavoid[ing] the economic disruption\u201d that would come \nfrom manufacturers \u201chaving to meet fifty-one separate \nsets of emission control requirements,\u201d Motor & \nEquip. Mfrs. Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. EPA, 627 F.2d 1095, 1109 \n(D.C. Cir. 1979); see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7507 (1977 \namendment allowing other States to adopt standards \n\u201cidentical to the California standards for which a \nwaiver has been granted for such model year\u201d); Pet. \n\n \n5 \n \nApp. 9a n.3 (noting that \u201cseventeen states have chosen \nto adopt some portion of the California regulations\u201d). \nCalifornia received its first waiver in 1968 and has \nreceived additional waivers in every subsequent dec-\nade.1  For instance, EPA granted a waiver in 1993 for \nCalifornia\u2019s first Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) regula-\ntion, which required a specific percentage of light-duty \nvehicles to be zero-emission vehicles with no exhaust \nor evaporative emissions.  58 Fed. Reg. 4166 (Jan. 13, \n1993).2  EPA granted another waiver, in 2009, for Cal-\nifornia\u2019s first set of regulations to control greenhouse-\ngas emissions from motor vehicles.  74 Fed. Reg. \n32,744 (July 8, 2009). \n2.  This litigation concerns a set of emissions \nstandards that California adopted in 2012 as part of \nits Advanced Clean Cars I program.  78 Fed. Reg. 2112 \n(Jan. 9, 2013).  As relevant here, those standards in-\ncluded a requirement that automakers reduce the av-\nerage greenhouse-gas emissions across the fleets of \nvehicles they sell in California.  See id. at 2114.  They \nalso included new ZEV standards, requiring manufac-\nturers to meet specified \u201cZEV credit percentage\u201d re-\nquirements.  Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(b) \n(2012).   \nA manufacturer can satisfy the \u201cZEV credit per-\ncentage\u201d in several ways:  by generating credits from \nsales of qualifying vehicles, purchasing credits from \nother manufacturers, using excess credits banked in \nprior years, or applying credits obtained by overcom-\n \n1 See EPA, Vehicle Emissions California Waivers and Authoriza-\ntions, https://tinyurl.com/3rxscztw (last visited Mar. 6, 2025). \n2  See Cal. Air Res. Bd., Low-Emission Vehicle Program,  \nhttps://tinyurl.com/49m28yze (last visited Mar. 6, 2025). \n\n \n6 \n \nplying with the greenhouse-gas emission require-\nments.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(d)(5); 78 \nFed. Reg. at 2119-2120, 2135.  The number of ZEV \ncredits generated by a vehicle sale depends on the ve-\nhicle\u2019s range when operating on electric power.  See \nCal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(d)(5).  For example, a \nplug-in hybrid vehicle with a \u201c50 mile\u201d electric range \nearns one credit, while a fully battery-electric vehicle \nwith a \u201c350 mile\u201d range earns four credits.3  As a re-\nsult, a fleet may satisfy the standards even though \nZEV sales as a percentage of light-duty vehicles sold \nis well below the applicable ZEV credit percentage re-\nquirement.  \nThe Advanced Clean Cars I standards affected \nmodel years beginning in 2017 (for greenhouse-gas \nemissions) and 2018 (for ZEV requirements).  Both \nsets of standards were originally structured to in-\ncrease in stringency through model year 2025 and re-\nmain in effect at 2025 levels for subsequent model \nyears.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1961.3(a)(1)(A) \n(2012); id. \u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2012); J.A. 50.  In 2022, \nhowever, California amended the ZEV standards (but \nnot the greenhouse-gas standards) to expire after \nmodel year 2025.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \n\u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2022).4 \n \n3 78 Fed. Reg. at 2114-2115; see Cal. Air Res. Bd., ACC II ZEV \nTechnology Assessment, at 11-12 tbl. 2 (Apr. 12, 2022) (showing \nelectric ranges of model year 2021 battery and plug-in hybrid ve-\nhicles), https://tinyurl.com/2d2db9vc (last visited Mar. 11, 2025).  \n4  California adopted that amendment because its Advanced \nClean Cars II standards included a new set of ZEV requirements \napplicable to model years 2026 and beyond.  See Cal. Code Regs. \ntit. 13, \u00a7 1962.4(a) (2022).  EPA granted a waiver for the Ad-\nvanced Clean Cars II standards on December 17, 2024.  90 Fed. \n(continued\u2026) \n\n \n7 \n \nCalifornia requested a waiver for the Advanced \nClean Cars I program in 2012.  That request described \nhow the new standards would increase production of \nzero-emission vehicles, thus decreasing emissions of \ncriteria pollutants and greenhouse gases.  J.A. 34-35, \n40-44.  EPA granted the waiver in early 2013.  78 Fed. \nReg. at 2145.  As the Federal Register notice of that \naction observed, petitions for judicial review were due \nby March 11, 2013.  Id.; see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1).  No-\nbody challenged EPA\u2019s decision to grant the waiver. \nMore than six years later, EPA withdrew the parts \nof the waiver at issue in this case.  84 Fed. Reg. 51,310 \n(Sept. 27, 2019).  By that time, automakers had made \n\u201cinvestments to meet\u201d the greenhouse-gas and ZEV \nstandards and \u201chad adjusted their fleets to comply \nwith\u201d them.  Pet. App. 12a; see id. at 124a.  Consumers \nhad grown increasingly familiar with zero-emission \nvehicles.  Even after the waiver was withdrawn, con-\nsumer demand for those vehicles continued to grow \nand automakers continued to announce plans to sell \nthem in greater numbers.  J.A. 191-192, 201-203.  By \n2020, for example, zero-emission vehicles were around \n8% of the new light-duty vehicles registered in Califor-\nnia; that figure jumped to over 12% the following \nyear.5 \nIn 2021, EPA solicited comment on whether it \nshould reinstate the waiver.  The state respondents \nsubmitted a comment in July 2021, explaining that \n \nReg. 642 (2025).  Several challenges to that waiver are now pend-\ning, including one that two of the petitioners here filed on Febru-\nary 28, 2025.  Pet. for Rev., Valero Renewable Fuels Co., LLC v. \nEPA, No. 25-1078 (D.C. Cir.).   \n5 Cal. Energy Comm\u2019n, New ZEV Sales in California, https://ti-\nnyurl.com/pt526fp5 (displaying \u201cZEV Sales Share\u201d in top-right \ncorner when 2020 and 2021 filters are selected). \n\n \n8 \n \nthe withdrawal was unlawful and poorly reasoned.  \nC.A. J.A. 188-215; see J.A. 51-68.  Auto-industry com-\nmenters emphasized the \u201cbillions of dollars of invest-\nment \nin \nelectric \nvehicle \nmanufacturing \nand \ninfrastructure\u201d that automakers had already made as \na result of the 2013 decision to grant the waiver.  J.A. \n103 (National Coalition for Advanced Transportation \ncomment); cf. J.A. 63 (California comment observing \nthat \u201cautomakers have complied with, and often over-\ncomplied with, model years 2017-2020 already\u201d).  EPA \nreinstated the waiver in March 2022.  87 Fed. Reg. \n14,332 (Mar. 14, 2022). \nB. Procedural Background \n1.  The petitioners here are various companies that \nproduce or sell liquid fuels, as well as related trade as-\nsociations.  Pet. App. 2a.  They filed petitions for re-\nview of EPA\u2019s reinstatement decision in the D.C. \nCircuit on May 12, 2022.  Id. at 15a.  The court of ap-\npeals consolidated those cases, along with another \ncase initiated by a group of States led by Ohio.  Id.  \nShortly thereafter, the state respondents here filed an \nunopposed motion for leave to intervene in support of \nEPA, as did various automakers and public-interest \norganizations.  Id. at 15a & nn.4-6; see J.A. 107.  Those \nmotions were granted.  See Pet. App. 15a. \nPetitioners principally argued that EPA\u2019s rein-\nstatement of the waiver contravened the Clean Air \nAct.  Pet. App. 16a.  Before the court of appeals could \nreach the merits of that claim, however, it had to as-\nsure itself of jurisdiction.  Under longstanding circuit \nrules, the opening brief for a petitioner seeking review \nof agency action \u201cmust set forth the basis for the claim \nof standing.\u201d  D.C. Cir. R. 28(a)(7).  And if \u201cstanding is \nnot apparent from the administrative record, the brief \nmust include arguments and evidence establishing the \n\n \n9 \n \nclaim of standing.\u201d  Id.; see also Sierra Club v. EPA, \n292 F.3d 895, 901 (D.C. Cir. 2002). \nPetitioners\u2019 opening brief below devoted just two \nparagraphs to standing.  J.A. 118-119.  Petitioners ex-\nplained that \u201cdepressing the demand\u201d for liquid fuels \n\u201cinjures petitioners and petitioners\u2019 members finan-\ncially.\u201d  Id. at 118.  They cited documents from Cali-\nfornia\u2019s 2011 rulemaking in which a California agency \nhad forecast the prospect of financial injury to oil and \ngas industry participants.  Id. (citing C.A. J.A. 799, \n801, 830, 832).  Petitioners asserted that \u201c[t]his eco-\nnomic injury . . . is caused by the challenged regula-\ntory action, and this Court can redress that injury by \nsetting aside the action.\u201d  J.A. 118.  They attached 14 \ndeclarations, but the only discussion of redressability \nin those declarations consisted of unsupported asser-\ntions that vacatur would remedy petitioners\u2019 injury.  \nId. at 130, 137, 150, 154, 158, 167. \nIn response, the state respondents argued that pe-\ntitioners had failed to establish standing, emphasizing \nthat petitioners provided no evidence that vacatur of \nthe reinstatement decision in May 2022 would change \nautomakers\u2019 behavior in a way that would increase \nfuel sales.  J.A. 185-187.  The state respondents also \nsubmitted evidence undermining the likelihood of any \nsuch change:  by 2022, sales of zero-emission vehicles \nin California exceeded what was required by the rele-\nvant standards; consumer demand for those vehicles \nwas growing, as was consumer willingness to pay price \npremiums; and many manufacturers had announced \nplans for even greater zero-emission vehicle sales in \nthe future.  Id. at 191-195, 201-203.  On reply, peti-\ntioners did not submit record evidence countering the \nstate respondents\u2019 evidence about the circumstances \nin 2022.  See id. at 209-211. \n\n \n10 \n \nAt oral argument, the panel questioned petitioners \nabout jurisdiction, with a particular focus on the \u201car-\ngument that you haven\u2019t demonstrated redressabil-\nity.\u201d  C.A. Oral Arg. 25:50-26:12.  Two weeks later, \npetitioners sought leave to file a supplemental brief \nand to supplement the record with two new declara-\ntions.  Pet. App. 30a.  The proposed brief and declara-\ntions mostly addressed the separate issue of mootness.  \nSee C.A. Private Pet. Proposed Supp. Br. 1-3, 4-13.  In \na short section on standing, petitioners characterized \nthe arguments against redressability as \u201cimplausible\u201d \nand \u201cincredible,\u201d id. at 3, 4\u2014but again cited no evi-\ndence establishing how judicial relief in May 2022 \nwould have redressed their asserted injuries, and did \nnot attempt to counter the state respondents\u2019 evidence \non that point.   \n2.  The court of appeals concluded that it lacked ju-\nrisdiction to decide petitioners\u2019 challenge because pe-\ntitioners had failed to establish Article III standing.  \nPet. App. 16a-19a.  Without deciding whether petition-\ners had established injury or causation, the court ex-\nplained that petitioners fell \u201cfar short of meeting their \nburden\u201d to establish a likelihood \u201cthat their alleged \ninjuries would be redressed\u201d if the court agreed with \npetitioners\u2019 merits theory and vacated EPA\u2019s rein-\nstatement decision.  Id. at 21a. \nAs the court explained, redressability for petition-\ners \u201c\u2018hinge[d] on\u2019 the actions of third parties\u2014the au-\ntomobile manufacturers who are subject to the \nwaiver.\u201d  Pet. App. 22a.  Petitioners needed to show \nthat automakers would respond to vacatur of the rein-\nstatement \u201cby producing and selling fewer non-con-\nventional vehicles or by altering the prices of their \nvehicles such that fewer non-conventional vehicles\u2014\nand more conventional vehicles\u2014were sold.\u201d  Id.  But \n\n \n11 \n \nthe record indicated \u201cthat \u2018manufacturers are already \nselling more qualifying vehicles in California than the \nState\u2019s standards require,\u2019\u201d id. at 28a, and \u201cthat \u2018both \ninternal sustainability goals and external market \nforces\u2019 are prompting manufacturers to transition to-\nward electric vehicles, irrespective of California\u2019s reg-\nulations,\u201d id. at 24a n.8; see also id. at 28a. \nNevertheless, the court of appeals observed, peti-\ntioners \u201ctreated redressability as a foregone conclu-\nsion\u201d instead of making a factual showing.  Pet. App. \n25a.  They did not \u201cattempt[] to explain in any detail \nhow their injuries are redressable, let alone to \u2018cit[e] \nany record evidence\u2019 or to file \u2018additional affidavits or \nother evidence sufficient to support\u2019 redressability.\u201d  \nId. at 24a-25a.  Nor did petitioners \u201cmeaningfully ad-\ndress[]\u201d redressability on reply, after the state re-\nspondents \nintroduced \narguments \nand \nevidence \ncontesting redressability.  Id. at 28a.  \u201cUltimately, the \nrecord evidence, coupled with the filings of the EPA \nand intervenors, provide[d] th[e] Court with no basis \nto conclude that Petitioners\u2019 claims are redressable\u2014\na necessary element of standing that Petitioners bear \nthe burden of establishing.\u201d  Id. at 29a. \nThe court of appeals also described its understand-\ning that the challenge before it \u201cconcern[ed] only\u201d the \nreinstatement of the waiver \u201cas to Model Years 2017 \nthrough 2025.\u201d  Pet. App. 22a.  But see supra p. 6; infra \np. 44.  On that understanding, the court explained, pe-\ntitioners had to show \u201cnot only that automobile man-\nufacturers are likely to respond to a decision by this \nCourt by changing their fleets in a way that alleviates \n[petitioners\u2019] injuries in some way, but also that auto-\nmobile manufacturers would do so relatively quickly\u2014\nby Model Year 2025.\u201d  Pet. App. 23a.  That timing ele-\n\n \n12 \n \nment \u201cfurther complicated\u201d the redressability analy-\nsis,\u201d in the court\u2019s view.  Id. at 22a.  \u201c[E]ven if\u201d peti-\ntioners \nhad \nestablished \nthat \n\u201cautomobile \nmanufacturers were inclined to change course\u201d in re-\nsponse to a vacatur in a way that would increase fuel \nsales, it was \u201cfar from clear that they could do so\u201d by \nmodel year 2025.  Id. at 24a; see id. at 23a. \nFinally, the court of appeals denied petitioners\u2019 \npost-argument motion for leave to file a supplemental \nbrief and declarations.  Pet. App. 30a-32a.  The court \nexplained that, under the circumstances, petitioners \nshould have understood their obligation to address re-\ndressability in their opening brief.  Id. at 31a.  Moreo-\nver, \u201c[p]etitioners offer[ed] no explanation for having \nfailed to address redressability in their reply brief af-\nter California raised the issue in its opposition brief.\u201d  \nId. at 32a. \nPetitioners did not seek panel rehearing or rehear-\ning en banc.  They instead filed a petition for a writ of \ncertiorari respecting both the redressability question \nand the merits of their statutory claim (which the \ncourt of appeals had not reached).  This Court granted \ncertiorari on the redressability question only.6 \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nPetitioners sought a judgment vacating EPA\u2019s re-\ninstatement of a nearly decade-old waiver.  Under set-\ntled precedent, petitioners had the burden of \nestablishing that automakers would likely respond to \n \n6 This Court also denied a petition for certiorari filed by Ohio and \nother petitioners, which advanced a separate constitutional \nclaim.  See Ohio v. EPA, No. 24-13 (Dec. 16, 2024).  The court of \nappeals had held that the Ohio petitioners established standing \nto bring that claim, but it rejected the claim on the merits.  See \nPet. App. 32a-49a. \n\n \n13 \n \nthat vacatur in ways that would increase demand for \npetitioners\u2019 liquid-fuel products.  By the time they \nfiled suit in May 2022, however, the likely effect of a \nvacatur was not self-evident:  in the nine years since \nEPA first granted the waiver, automakers had made \nenormous investments in producing and marketing \nzero-emission vehicles; consumer demand for those ve-\nhicles had recently surged; and evidence before the \nCourt indicated that automakers would continue to \nsell those vehicles in large numbers regardless of the \nreinstatement or its potential vacatur.  Article III re-\nquired petitioners to introduce current evidence but-\ntressing their assertion that a vacatur in 2022 would \nlead automakers to change their fleets or prices in \nways that would increase liquid-fuel sales.  Because \npetitioners did not even attempt to do so, the court of \nappeals properly held that they failed to establish \nstanding. \nIn this Court, petitioners advance several novel \ntheories for why they had no obligation to introduce \nany evidence of redressability.  None of those theories \nis persuasive.  They first propose a categorical rule \nthat redressability is automatically established when-\never a challenged government action implicates the \nuse of the challenger\u2019s products.  Pet. Br. 17-18.  Prec-\nedent forecloses that proposal:  this Court has consist-\nently focused on the particular facts of a case\u2014and \nrequired challengers to submit specific evidence sup-\nporting redressability before obtaining a final judg-\nment.  For similar reasons, plaintiffs may not rely on \nunsupported predictions about the effects of a judg-\nment on a third party\u2019s choices.  See id. at 18.  They \nmust instead meet \u201ctheir burden of showing that third \nparties will likely react in predictable ways\u201d by intro-\nducing actual evidence.  Dep\u2019t of Com. v. New York, \n588 U.S. 752, 768 (2019).  And the fact that a statute \n\n \n14 \n \nor regulation \u201cdoes not sunset\u201d (Pet. Br. 19) does not, \nby itself, establish standing to challenge it. \nFinally, petitioners\u2019 belated attempts to identify \nrecord evidence supporting redressability cannot \nchange the outcome here.  Their briefs and declara-\ntions below were conclusory on the subject of redress-\nability.  The additional evidence they describe in this \nCourt not only comes too late, it would have been in-\nsufficient even if they had presented it below:  it con-\nsists of outdated projections that cannot substitute for \nevidence about the market as it existed when petition-\ners filed this challenge in May 2022. \nARGUMENT \nI. PETITIONERS FAILED TO ESTABLISH REDRESSA-\nBILITY \nPetitioners had the burden to establish standing.  \nAs to redressability, they had to show that judicial va-\ncatur of the reinstatement decision at the time they \nfiled suit in May 2022 would likely lead to increased \nfuel sales.  They failed to carry that burden.   \nA. It Was Petitioners\u2019 Burden to Introduce \nEvidence Establishing Each Element of \nArticle III Standing \nBefore turning to the merits of a suit, a court must \nassure itself of jurisdiction.  Summers v. Earth Island \nInst., 555 U.S. 488, 499 (2009).  The \u201cburden of estab-\nlishing\u201d jurisdiction lies with \u201cthe party asserting ju-\nrisdiction.\u201d  Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., \n511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994) (citing McNutt v. Gen. Motors \nAcceptance Corp. of Ind., 298 U.S. 178, 182-183 \n(1936)). \nStanding is \u201can essential and unchanging part\u201d of \nArticle III jurisdiction.  Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 \n\n \n15 \n \nU.S. 555, 560 (1992).  The doctrine of standing is built \non \u201cthe idea of separation of powers.\u201d  United States v. \nTexas, 599 U.S. 670, 675 (2023).  It \u201cimplements \u2018the \nFramers\u2019 concept of the proper\u2014and properly lim-\nited\u2014role of the courts in a democratic society.\u2019\u201d  FDA \nv. All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 380 (2024) \n(quoting Roberts, Article III Limits on Statutory \nStanding, 42 Duke L.J. 1219, 1220 (1993)). \nThe \u201cirreducible constitutional minimum of stand-\ning contains three elements.\u201d  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560.  \nFirst, the party bringing suit \u201cmust have suffered an \n\u2018injury in fact.\u2019\u201d  Id.  Second, that injury must \u201cbe \n\u2018fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defend-\nant, and not the result of the independent action of \nsome third party not before the court.\u2019\u201d  Id. (altera-\ntions omitted).  And third, \u201cit must be \u2018likely,\u2019 as op-\nposed to merely \u2018speculative,\u2019 that the injury will be \n\u2018redressed by a favorable decision.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 561.  Each \nelement is assessed as of the time the suit commenced.  \nMurthy v. Missouri, 603 U.S. 43, 58 (2024). \nA party seeking to invoke the jurisdiction of a fed-\neral court \u201cmust support each element of standing \n\u2018with the manner and degree of evidence required at \nthe successive stages of the litigation.\u2019\u201d  Murthy, 603 \nU.S. at 58.  At the outset of litigation, \u201c\u2018mere allega-\ntions\u2019\u201d may suffice; as the case progresses, a party \n\u201cmust . . . point to factual evidence.\u201d  Id.  A petitioner \nwho challenges agency action may be able to carry its \nburden by identifying evidence in the administrative \nrecord that establishes its standing.  See, e.g., Sierra \nClub v. EPA, 292 F.3d 895, 899-900 (D.C. Cir. 2002).  \nBut if \u201cstanding is not apparent from the administra-\ntive record,\u201d a petitioner\u2019s \u201cbrief must include argu-\nments and evidence establishing the claim of \nstanding.\u201d  D.C. Cir. R. 28(a)(7); see Sierra Club, 292 \n\n \n16 \n \nF.3d at 900; see generally 15 Redish, Moore\u2019s Federal \nPractice \u00a7\u00a7 101.31, 101.61[10] (3d ed. & Supp. 2025). \nSometimes standing analysis is straightforward.  \nFor instance, in some cases the party invoking the \ncourt\u2019s jurisdiction is itself \u201can object of\u201d the chal-\nlenged government action.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.  \nThe government might, for example, proscribe speech \nthat the plaintiff engages in.  See, e.g., Susan B. An-\nthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 161-167 (2014).  \nOr it might require a state plaintiff to engage in par-\nticular regulation.  See, e.g., West Virginia v. EPA, 597 \nU.S. 697, 718-719 (2022).  In those scenarios, \u201cthere is \nordinarily little question that the action . . . has \ncaused [the plaintiff] injury, and that a judgment pre-\nventing . . . the action will redress\u201d that injury.  Lujan, \n504 U.S. at 561-562; see All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 \nU.S. at 382. \nIn other scenarios, \u201cmuch more is needed.\u201d  Lujan, \n504 U.S. at 562.  When a party\u2019s \u201casserted injury \narises from the government\u2019s allegedly unlawful regu-\nlation . . . of someone else,\u201d for example, standing can \nbe \u201c\u2018substantially more difficult\u2019 to establish.\u201d  Id.  In \nthose cases, \u201ccausation and redressability ordinarily \nhinge on the response of\u201d that third party\u2014\u201cand per-\nhaps on the response of others as well.\u201d  Id.  Because \nthe inquiry turns on \u201cchoices made by independent ac-\ntors not before the courts,\u201d the plaintiff must \u201cadduce \nfacts showing that those choices have been or will be \nmade in such manner as to produce causation and per-\nmit redressability of injury.\u201d  Id.  For instance, if plain-\ntiffs are injured by the lack of affordable private \nhousing, they must show \u201can actionable causal rela-\ntionship\u201d between the challenged zoning ordinance \nand the choices of private third parties who build and \nsell housing.  Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 507 \n\n \n17 \n \n(1975).  Their claim may not proceed if the asserted \ninjury instead results from \u201cthe economics of the area \nhousing market.\u201d  Id. at 506; see generally id. at 508 \n(requiring the party \u201cwho seeks to challenge\u201d a gov-\nernment action to introduce \u201cspecific, concrete facts \ndemonstrating . . . that he personally would benefit in \na tangible way from the court\u2019s intervention\u201d). \nConcrete evidence from the plaintiff is especially \ncritical if another party has introduced evidence un-\ndermining the asserted theory of standing.  \u201cWhen \nchallenged by . . . an opposing party,\u201d for example, a \nplaintiff \u201cinvoking the court\u2019s jurisdiction cannot \nsimply allege a nonobvious harm, without more.\u201d  \nWittman v. Personhuballah, 578 U.S. 539, 545 (2016).  \nAnd if \u201cthere is no \u2018more,\u2019\u201d then there is no jurisdic-\ntion.  Id.; see generally Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U.S. \n77, 96-97 (2010) (when defendants raise facts calling \njurisdiction into doubt, plaintiffs \u201cmust support their \nallegations by competent proof\u201d). \nB. The Circumstances of This Case Raised a \nSerious Question as to Whether Petition-\ners\u2019 Claim Was Redressable \nAs the court of appeals recognized, this is not a case \nwhere standing is self-evident.  Petitioners comprise \ncompanies that produce or refine fuel, companies that \ndevelop biorefining technology, and various trade as-\nsociations (for energy companies, farmers, and con-\nvenience store owners).  Pet. Br. II-V, 20.  They claim \nan injury of financial harm from reduced fuel sales.  \nId. at 21-22.  But the standards at issue here do not \nregulate fuel production or sales.  Instead, the stand-\nards regulate an activity in which petitioners do not \nparticipate:  automobile sales.  Because petitioners are \nnot directly regulated by the challenged agency action, \n\n \n18 \n \nthey needed to identify evidence showing that au-\ntomakers who are subject to those standards would \nmake choices that would \u201cproduce causation and per-\nmit redressability of injury.\u201d  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 562. \nPetitioners\u2019 theory is that the state emissions \nstandards injure them by effectively requiring au-\ntomakers to sell more \u201cvehicles that use less or no liq-\nuid fuel,\u201d which reduces demand for petitioners\u2019 \nproducts.  Pet. Br. 17.  They posit that their revenues \nwould increase if the standards no longer had legal ef-\nfect, because automakers would then make and sell \nmore cars that run on liquid fuel.  Id. at 24.  That the-\nory would indeed have been \u201cstraightforward\u201d (id. at \n35) if petitioners had promptly sought review follow-\ning EPA\u2019s original approval of the waiver in 2013\u2014as \nthey recently did in challenging the Advanced Clean \nCars II waiver, see supra p. 6 n.4.7 \nIn calendar year 2013, zero-emission vehicles made \nup about 2% of light-duty vehicle sales in California.8  \nTo meet the \u201cminimum ZEV credit percentage\u201d re-\nquirements of the Advanced Clean Cars I standards, \n \n7 Petitioners have suggested that D.C. Circuit precedent prohib-\nited them from challenging the 2013 action because California \ndeemed compliance with federal standards to satisfy the state \nstandards.  See Pet. 8 (citing Chamber of Com. of U.S. v. EPA, \n642 F.3d 192, 206 (D.C. Cir. 2011)); Pet. Br. 8-9.  But California\u2019s \nZEV standards\u2014the main focus of petitioners\u2019 present chal-\nlenge\u2014never contained a \u201cdeemed-to-comply\u201d provision, and \nthus could have been challenged in 2013.  J.A. 59-60 n.14 \n(deemed-to-comply provision \u201conly applies to the [greenhouse-\ngas] standard\u201d). \n8 See Cal. Air Res. Bd., California\u2019s Advanced Clean Cars Mid-\nterm Review, App. B, at B15 fig. 9 (Jan. 18, 2017), https://ti-\nnyurl.com/yrzdx3t4. \n\n \n19 \n \nautomakers needed to grow their zero-emission vehi-\ncle sales many times over:  they would have to meet a \nminimum credit percentage of 4.5% by model year \n2018, rising to 22% by model year 2025.  Cal. Code \nRegs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2012).  Regulators es-\ntimated that meeting that 22% credit requirement \nwould require zero-emission vehicles to comprise \nabout 15% of light-duty new-vehicle sales by 2025.  See \nJ.A. 16, 32; 78 Fed. Reg. 2112, 2119 (Jan. 9, 2013).  Ab-\nsent the new regulatory requirement, there was no \nreason to think automakers would make that shift for \ntheir own independent reasons.  Consumers in 2013 \nwere largely unfamiliar with zero-emission vehicles or \nhad a negative impression of them.9  And automakers \nwarned that \u201cconsumer demand for ZEVs\u201d was so ane-\nmic that they might not even be able to meet the re-\nquirements for model year 2018.  78 Fed. Reg. at 2140.   \nBut petitioner challenged EPA\u2019s reinstatement of \nthe waiver nearly a decade later.  By then, companies \nhad been \u201cmaking investments\u201d for years \u201cin updating \ntheir fleets and growing consumer demand for electric \nvehicles.\u201d  Pet. App. 12a, 14a.

App. 13a-14a.   \nWhatever their cause, automakers\u2019 enormous in-\nvestments in electric vehicles since 2013 resulted in a \ndramatic increase in demand for zero-emission vehi-\ncles between 2020 and 2022.  See J.A. 191 (national \nmarket share of qualifying vehicles \u201calmost tripled\u201d \nacross that two-year period).

Br. 18, 34, 35) in \nMay 2022 that reduced sales of petitioners\u2019 fuel prod-\nucts were caused by the reinstatement of the waiver\u2014\ninstead of market forces and automakers\u2019 prior invest-\nments and plans.  Nor was it obvious that vacatur of \nthe reinstatement would likely affect automakers\u2019 fu-\nture behavior in a way that would redress the asserted \ninjury. \nIndeed, evidence submitted by the state respond-\nents indicated the opposite.  Publicly accessible sales \ndata showed that \u201czero-emission vehicles sold in cal-\nendar year 2022\u201d in California \u201cexceed what [the] \nstandards require.\u201d  J.A. 192.  For that calendar year, \nabout 19% of light-duty vehicles sold in the State qual-\nified as zero-emission vehicles under California\u2019s \nstandards\u2014exceeding the 15% that regulators had \nforecast would be needed for compliance.  Id. at 191-\n192; see supra p. 19.  The lion\u2019s share of those sales \n(16% of total light-duty sales) were battery-electric ve-\nhicles.13   \nThat represented a surge in sales of battery-elec-\ntric vehicles that far outpaced early forecasts.  The \nforecasts had projected that automakers would need \nbattery-electric vehicles to be just 3.7% of total light-\nduty sales by model year 2025 to meet the credit re-\nquirements of the ZEV standards.  J.A. 9.  The unex-\npected consumer shift to battery-electric vehicles \n(rather than plug-in hybrids, as forecasters originally \n \n13\n New \nZEV \nSales \nin \nCalifornia, \nsupra, \nhttps://ti-\nnyurl.com/pt526fp5 (displaying 262,076 \u201cBEV\u201d out of 1,581,844 \nannual light-duty sales when 2022 filter is selected). \n\n \n22 \n \nanticipated) had profound consequences for automak-\ners\u2019 compliance with the Advanced Clean Cars I stand-\nards.  Because battery-electric vehicles can travel \nlonger distances without emitting tailpipe pollutants, \nthey yield the most \u201cZEV credits\u201d for purposes of the \nstandards.  See supra p. 6.  So the fact that 16% of \nlight-duty sales were battery-electric vehicles in 2022 \nyielded a ZEV credit percentage for that year that was \nfar above the highest requirement that the standards \nwould ever impose.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \n\u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2012) (22% ZEV credit requirement \nstarting in model year 2025).  And sales in California \nin 2022 were also exceeding the most stringent re-\nquirements of the fleetwide greenhouse-gas stand-\nards, even for future years, because the battery-\nelectric vehicles also have far lower emissions than \nplug-in hybrids.  See J.A. 7. \nBy May 2022, nine years after EPA first granted a \nwaiver for the Advanced Clean Cars I standards, there \nwas substantial reason to believe that automakers \nwould exceed the standards for their own reasons even \nwithout the reinstatement.  The court of appeals could \nnot \u201cpresume[]\u201d that petitioners\u2019 challenge was re-\ndressable.  Kokkonen, 511 U.S. at 377.  Nor could it \nassume redressability based on petitioners\u2019 \u201cuna-\ndorned speculation.\u201d  Simon v. E. Ky. Welfare Rts. \nOrg., 426 U.S. 26, 44 (1976).  Article III required the \ncourt to ask whether petitioners had \u201cmet their bur-\nden\u201d by introducing evidence demonstrating that au-\ntomakers would \u201clikely react\u201d to a vacatur of the 2022 \nreinstatement in ways that would increase demand for \npetitioners\u2019 products and services.  Dep\u2019t of Com. v. \nNew York, 588 U.S. 752, 768 (2019).   \n\n \n23 \n \nC. Petitioners Did Not Introduce Evidence \nEstablishing Redressability \nPetitioners did not carry their evidentiary burden.  \nIndeed, they submitted virtually no argument or evi-\ndence bearing on the likely effect of a vacatur on the \nmarket as it existed in 2022.   \n1.  Petitioners\u2019 opening brief in the court of appeals \ndevoted one sentence to redressability.  They asserted \nthat their \u201cinjury is caused by the challenged regula-\ntory action, and this Court can redress that injury by \nsetting aside the action.\u201d  J.A. 118.  That single con-\nclusory statement was not supported by any citation \nto evidence in the administrative record or elsewhere.  \nPetitioners attached 14 standing declarations to their \nopening brief.  See J.A. 120-184.  But none of those \ndeclarations was sufficient to carry their burden. \nThe bulk of each declaration described the declar-\nant\u2019s asserted injuries, with details supporting the \n(undisputed) proposition that petitioners and their \nmembers profit from fuel sales.  The declarants had \nalmost nothing to say about the critical question going \nto causation and redressability, which \u201care often \u2018flip \nsides of the same coin.\u2019\u201d  All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 \nU.S. at 380.  That question was whether, in 2022, the \nreinstatement of the waiver or the vacatur of that re-\ninstatement would affect automakers\u2019 choices in a \nmanner leading to changes in fuel sales.   \nOf the declarants who addressed causation, some \nasserted their \u201cunderstand[ing] that California\u2019s \ngreenhouse-gas standards and zero-emission-vehicle \nmandate reduce the demand for fuel in California.\u201d  \nJ.A. 125, 140, 169, 183; see also J.A. 176.  Those asser-\ntions were not accompanied by supporting facts or any \ndiscussion of the circumstances in 2022.

Those outdated sources did not establish \nthat any reduced fuel sales in 2022 were caused by the \nwaiver\u2019s reinstatement instead of the dramatic \nchanges in the market and consumer demand that \npredated the reinstatement.14  \nThe declarants who addressed redressability did so \nin a single boilerplate sentence asserting that petition-\ners\u2019 \u201cinjuries would be substantially ameliorated if \nEPA\u2019s decision were set aside.\u201d  J.A. 130, 137, 150, \n154, 158, 167, 181; see Pet. App. 21a-22a.  Again, not \none of the declarants addressed the state of the market \nin 2022, when petitioners filed their suit.  Nor did they \nsay a word about automakers\u2019 behavior at that time, \nor the economic and other considerations that would \nshape automakers\u2019 response to a judicial vacatur.  See \ngenerally Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Env\u2019t \nServs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 201 (2000) (Scalia, J., \ndissenting) (discussing this Court\u2019s \u201crefus[al] to find \n \n14 One declarant also referenced a 2020 report by a Minnesota \nagency.  J.A. 174; see Pet. Br. 38.  But the national market share \nof qualifying vehicles \u201calmost tripled\u201d between 2020 and 2022.  \nJ.A. 191.  In any event, petitioners\u2019 briefs in the court of appeals \nnever mentioned effects on the Minnesota market as a basis for \nstanding. \n\n \n25 \n \nstanding based on the \u2018conclusory allegations of an af-\nfidavit\u2019\u201d); Lujan v. Nat\u2019l Wildlife Fed\u2019n, 497 U.S. 871, \n898-899 (1990) (\u201cagree[ing]\u201d that an affidavit was \u201cin-\nsufficient to establish [the challenger\u2019s] right to seek \njudicial review\u201d where it was \u201c\u2018conclusory and com-\npletely devoid of specific facts\u2019\u201d with respect to the key \nissue). \nEven after the state respondents submitted their \nown evidence addressing those subjects and undercut-\nting petitioners\u2019 theory of redressability, supra p. 9, \npetitioners did not \u201cmeaningfully address[] the re-\ndressability of their economic injuries in their reply \nbrief[].\u201d  Pet. App. 28a-29a.  Their primary contention \non reply was that the States\u2019 argument \u201cdefies com-\nmon sense.\u201d  J.A. 209.  They also quoted statements \nfrom the state respondents\u2019 July 2021 comment in sup-\nport of the reinstatement.  Id. at 210; see Pet. Br. 38 \n(citing J.A. 66).  Those statements explained why \nEPA\u2019s 2019 decision to revoke the waiver was unjusti-\nfied based on the record EPA had before it in that year, \nsee J.A. 66 (citing 84 Fed. Reg. 51,310, 51,337 (Sept. \n27, 2019)), and then described California\u2019s \u201cdemon-\nstration in its 2012 waiver request,\u201d J.A. 66.  Neither \nstatement could have taken account of the market \ndata showing that zero-emission vehicle sales tripled \nbetween 2020 and mid-2022.  See id. at 191. \nAnd petitioners\u2019 reply (J.A. 208-212) did not mean-\ningfully address that more recent data either\u2014or the \nevidence showing that market penetration of zero-\nemission vehicles in California in 2022 far exceeded \nany current or future requirement of the relevant \nstandards.  Nor did petitioners respond to the evidence \nindicating that automakers would \u201cha[ve] a similar in-\ncentive to engage in\u201d the promotion and sale of zero-\n\n \n26 \n \nemission vehicles even if the standards were not in ef-\nfect.  Clapper v. Amnesty Int\u2019l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 417 \n(2013); see Warth, 422 U.S. at 506 (no standing where \nevidence suggested that plaintiffs\u2019 injury was \u201cthe con-\nsequence of the economics of the . . . market\u201d).15 \nIn short, petitioners\u2019 initial submission relied on \nthe \u201cpossibility, unsubstantiated by allegations of fact, \nthat their situation . . . might improve were the court \nto afford relief.\u201d  Warth, 422 U.S. at 507.  And petition-\ners\u2019 submission on reply neglected their duty to \u201csup-\nport their allegations by competent proof,\u201d once \n\u201cchallenged on allegations of jurisdictional facts.\u201d  \nHertz Corp., 559 U.S. at 96-97.   \n2.  Article III demanded more.  This Court has re-\npeatedly rejected theories of redressability that de-\npend on \u201c\u2018guesswork as to how independent \ndecisionmakers will exercise their judgment\u2019\u201d instead \nof concrete evidence submitted by the party seeking to \ninvoke federal jurisdiction.  Murthy, 603 U.S. at 57; \nsee, e.g., id. at 73-74; Haaland v. Brackeen, 599 U.S. \n255, 293-294 (2023); Lujan, 504 U.S. at 568-571 (plu-\nrality opinion); Simon, 426 U.S. at 42-43.  \u201cA federal \ncourt cannot ignore\u201d a party\u2019s failure to establish re-\ndressability \u201cwithout overstepping its assigned role in \nour system of adjudicating only actual cases and con-\ntroversies.\u201d  Simon, 426 U.S. at 39.  Because petition-\ners did not provide the court of appeals with any facts \nshowing a likelihood that vacating EPA\u2019s 2022 rein-\nstatement would redress their asserted injuries, the \ncourt properly held that it lacked jurisdiction to decide \nthe merits.  Pet. App. 30a. \n \n15 See generally Nat\u2019l Council for Adoption v. Blinken, 4 F.4th \n106, 111-112 (D.C. Cir. 2021) (discussing when standing evidence \nmay be introduced on reply).   \n\n \n27 \n \nNo one can doubt petitioners\u2019 desire to obtain an \nimmediate and definitive judicial resolution of their \nmerits theories.  See Pet. 26-27.  But the requirements \nof Article III often \u201cmean[] that the federal courts de-\ncide some contested legal questions later rather than \nsooner.\u201d  All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 380.  \nThe court of appeals properly adhered to those re-\nquirements here, refusing to reach the merits after pe-\ntitioners forewent any genuine effort to introduce facts \nestablishing a likelihood that vacatur of the 2022 re-\ninstatement would increase demand for their prod-\nucts. \nII. PETITIONERS IDENTIFY NO VALID BASIS FOR RE-\nVERSAL \nHaving failed \u201cto \u2018cit[e] any record evidence\u2019 or to \nfile \u2018additional affidavits or other evidence sufficient to \nsupport\u2019 redressability\u201d in the court below, Pet. App. \n24a-25a, petitioners now ask this Court to hold that \nthey did \u201cnot need to supply additional record evi-\ndence,\u201d Pet. Br. 17.  They advance three theories:  \n(i) that the Court should \u201cadopt [a] categorical rule\u201d \nthat this type of government action \u201calone suffices to \nestablish redressability,\u201d id. at 17, 18; (ii) that redress-\nability follows from the purported \u201cpredictable effects\u201d \nof the 2022 reinstatement on automakers, id. at 18; \nand (iii) that the duration of the challenged waiver, by \nitself, establishes redressability, see id. at 19, 45-47.  \nBut this Court\u2019s precedent forecloses those theories.  \nAnd petitioners\u2019 attempt to argue, in the alternative, \nthat the record contains \u201cplenty [of] evidence\u201d support-\ning redressability (id. at 37) ignores the gulf between \nthe referenced evidence and the question that mat-\ntered:  how automakers would likely have responded \nto a decision vacating the waiver in May 2022.   \n\n \n28 \n \nA. Government Regulations Implicating the \nUse of a Product Do Not Categorically Es-\ntablish Standing for Producers to Sue \nPetitioners first propose a categorical rule that re-\ndressability is automatically established in every chal-\nlenge seeking to \u201cremove a regulatory impediment to \nthe use of petitioners\u2019 products.\u201d  Pet. Br. 17.  They \nnever clarify the scope of the word \u201cimpediment.\u201d  But \nit appears that their rule would cover a flat prohibition \non the use of a product as well as any lesser restriction \nthat allegedly affects or implicates its use.  And the \nrule would apply even where (as here) the record con-\ntains evidence indicating that a favorable judgment \nwould not actually redress the asserted injury.  That \nnovel proposal finds no basis in this Court\u2019s precedent.  \nFor a court to conclude that it has jurisdiction, the \n\u201c\u2018specific facts\u2019\u201d matter\u2014as does the \u201cevidence\u201d sub-\nmitted by the parties.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561. \n1. Petitioners\u2019 proposed rule is at odds \nwith the precedent they invoke \nPetitioners point to Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154 \n(1997), as support for their proposed rule.  Pet. Br. 25-\n26.  That decision reiterated that an injury resulting \nfrom \u201cthe independent action of some third party not \nbefore the court\u201d is insufficient to establish Article III \nstanding.  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 169 (internal quotation \nmarks and emphasis omitted).  It also noted that the \nbar on standing for injuries caused by independent ac-\ntion does not \u201cexclude injury produced by determina-\ntive or coercive effect\u201d of a government action on the \nchoices of a third party.  Id.  Bennett thus confirms the \ncommon-sense proposition that a petitioner is not nec-\nessarily foreclosed from establishing redressability \njust because a third party is \u201cthe very last step in the \n\n \n29 \n \nchain of causation.\u201d  Id.; see also Lujan, 504 U.S. at \n562. \nBut Bennett hardly supports petitioners\u2019 sweeping \ntheory that redressability is automatically established \nwhenever a challenger simply asserts some \u201cregula-\ntory impediment\u201d (Pet. Br. 25) to the use of its product.  \nTo the contrary, the Court\u2019s decision underscores how \nmuch the particular facts of a case matter.  In Bennett, \nranchers and irrigation districts challenged a Fish and \nWildlife Service biological opinion that proposed min-\nimum water levels for a water project.  But a third \nparty (the Bureau of Reclamation) \u201cretain[ed] ulti-\nmate responsibility\u201d for deciding whether to adopt the \nproposal.  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 168.  With respect to \ncausation and redressability, the main question was \nwhether the Bureau would in fact feel constrained to \ndo what the Service suggested.   \nScrutinizing the facts before it, the Court deter-\nmined that\u2014\u201cin reality\u201d\u2014the biological opinion would \nhave a \u201cdeterminative or coercive effect\u201d on the Bu-\nreau\u2019s action.  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 169.  Although the \nopinion was theoretically advisory, the Service had \nacknowledged \u201cthe virtually determinative effect of its \nbiological opinions.\u201d  Id. at 170.  And the Solicitor Gen-\neral conceded that this particular opinion would have \n\u201ca powerful coercive effect\u201d on the Bureau.  Id. at 169.  \nBefore the opinion, the Bureau had operated the water \nproject \u201cin the same manner throughout the 20th cen-\ntury.\u201d  Id. at 170.  But the Bureau had notified the \nService that in the future it \u201cintended to act in accord-\nance with\u201d the recommendations in the Service\u2019s opin-\nion.16  Those facts showed that the opinion (not some \n \n16 Resp. Br., Bennett v. Spear, No. 95-813 (U.S.), 1996 WL 396714, \n(continued\u2026) \n\n \n30 \n \nother motivation) would cause the Bureau to alter its \nbehavior.  And they allowed the Court to hold that pe-\ntitioners\u2019 injury would \u201c\u2018likely\u2019 be redressed\u2014i.e., the \nBureau will not impose [the] water level restrictions\u2014\nif the Biological Opinion is set aside.\u201d  Bennett, 520 \nU.S. at 170-171.   \nThe other cases invoked by petitioners featured \nsimilar factual assessments.  In Pierce v. Society of the \nSisters of the Holy Names of Jesus & Mary, 268 U.S. \n510 (1925), the law prohibiting parents from sending \ntheir children to private schools had \u201ccaused the with-\ndrawal from [the plaintiff\u2019s] schools of children who \nwould otherwise continue.\u201d  Id. at 532 (emphasis \nadded).  In CBS, Inc. v. United States, 316 U.S. 407, \n414, 423 (1942), an affidavit from the plaintiff radio \nnetwork made clear that radio stations were in fact \n\u201ccancelling or threatening to cancel their contracts in \norder to conform to\u201d the challenged regulations.  And \nin Northeastern Florida Chapter of Associated General \nContractors v. City of Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656, 668 \n(1993), standing rested on petitioner\u2019s allegation that \nits members \u201cregularly bid on construction contracts\u201d \nand \u201cwould have bid on contracts\u201d unavailable to them \ndue to the challenged program \u201cwere they so able.\u201d  Be-\ncause those allegations \u201cha[d] not been challenged,\u201d \nthe Court \u201cassum[ed] that they [were] true.\u201d  Id. at \n668-669.17   \n \nat *27 n.14 (July 15, 1996); see also id. at *8; Bennett v. Plenert, \n1993 WL 669429, at *3 (D. Or. Nov. 18, 1993). \n17 Because of the nature of the equal protection right at issue in \nNortheastern Florida, the companies did not need to show that \nthird parties would have selected their bids\u2014just that the com-\npanies were unable to compete on an equal basis.  See, e.g., Gratz \nv. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 244, 262 (2003). \n\n \n31 \n \nNone of those cases supports a categorical rule ex-\ncusing anyone who sells a product from the obligation \nto establish redressability when challenging a regula-\ntion implicating the use of that product.  And the pos-\nture of cases like Bennett and CBS only underscores \nthe deficiency of petitioners\u2019 showing here.  The peti-\ntioners in those cases sought to survive a motion to \ndismiss, and therefore had the \u201crelatively modest\u201d \nburden of advancing \u201c\u2018general factual allegations\u2019\u201d on \nthe elements of standing.  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 168, \n171; see CBS, 316 U.S. at 414, 423; cf. Ne. Fla., 508 \nU.S. at 668-669.  Here, petitioners were seeking to ob-\ntain a final judgment.  So they needed to \u201c\u2018set forth\u2019 by \naffidavit or other evidence \u2018specific facts\u2019\u201d demonstrat-\ning that vacatur would likely redress their injury.  \nBennett, 520 U.S. at 168; see Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.  \nNo amount of after-the-fact theorizing can excuse \ntheir failure to do so.   \nFor similar reasons, Energy Future Coalition v. \nEPA, 793 F.3d 141 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (Kavanaugh, J.), \ndoes not establish standing here.  That case involved \nethanol producers who sought to challenge an EPA \nregulation prohibiting automakers from using fuel \ncontaining 30% ethanol when testing new vehicles.  Id. \nat 143-144.  The court of appeals observed that stand-\ning can be shown where judicial relief \u201cwould remove \na regulatory hurdle\u201d to the use of a petitioner\u2019s prod-\nuct.  Id. at 144; see Pet. Br. 4, 13, 28, 29, 36.  But that \nwas the starting point for the court\u2019s analysis\u2014not the \nfinish line.  Unlike the petitioners here, the challeng-\ners in Energy Future submitted a detailed standing \nanalysis, which included an economist\u2019s explanation of \nhow the regulated parties would react to the sought-\n\n \n32 \n \nafter change.18  The court was therefore able to focus \non actual record evidence establishing \u201csubstantial \nreason to think that at least some vehicle manufactur-\ners would use\u201d the fuel in testing if the challenged reg-\nulation were eliminated.  Energy Future, 793 F.3d at \n144; see also id. at 144 (describing comments from \nFord Motor Company).  And the court expressly dis-\ntinguished the case before it from a case (like this one) \nin which studies and other \u201cobjective evidence directly \nundermined petitioners\u2019 theory of standing.\u201d  Id. at \n145 n.2. \n2. Petitioners\u2019 rule would violate basic \nprinciples of Article III standing \nThat focus on the particular circumstances of the \ncase, and the allegations and evidence before the \ncourt, is compelled by core requirements of Article III. \na.  Federal courts may not exercise jurisdiction \nbased on assumptions or speculation.  See, e.g., Clap-\nper, 568 U.S. at 414; Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better \nEnv\u2019t, 523 U.S. 83, 94 (1998).  After the pleading stage, \nthey must assure themselves that standing exists by \nexamining \u201c\u2018specific facts\u2019\u201d and \u201cevidence\u201d introduced \nby the plaintiff.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561; see All. for \nHippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 384 (noting the \u201cheavily \nfact-dependent\u201d nature of the inquiry).  That obliga-\ntion takes on added significance when the circum-\nstances of a case (or evidence submitted by the \nopposing party) create serious doubts about one of the \nelements of standing.  See generally Hertz Corp., 559 \nU.S. at 96-97. \n \n18 See Pet. Br., Energy Future, No. 14-1123, 2014 WL 5035232, at \n*29-41 (D.C. Cir. Oct. 8, 2014). \n\n \n33 \n \nTo be sure, \u201cthe nature and extent of facts that \nmust be\u201d submitted by a party seeking to challenge \ngovernment action \u201cdepends considerably\u201d on the sur-\nrounding circumstances.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.  A \nplaintiff who is directly regulated by the challenged \naction, for example, may only need to submit evidence \nshowing that it is an object of that regulation, and that \nit would engage in activities proscribed by the regula-\ntion if it were allowed to do so.  Supra p. 16.  Similarly, \nif the action prohibits other companies from using the \nplaintiff\u2019s product, causation and redressability may \nfollow from basic evidence that the plaintiff sells the \nproduct and third-party companies would have used it \nabsent the regulation.  See, e.g., Energy Future, 793 \nF.3d at 144. \nBut observations about the ease of satisfying evi-\ndentiary requirements in certain types of cases do not \namount to a categorical legal rule that \u201csuffices to es-\ntablish redressability\u201d absent evidence.  Pet. Br. 17.  \nAs this Court has explained, presumptions run \nagainst jurisdiction\u2014not in favor of it.  See, e.g., Renne \nv. Geary, 501 U.S. 312, 316 (1991) (\u201cWe presume that \nfederal courts lack jurisdiction unless the contrary ap-\npears affirmatively from the record.\u201d (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted)); see also Kokkonen, 511 U.S. at \n377.   \nA court must therefore examine the facts and evi-\ndence to determine whether\u2014\u201cin reality\u201d\u2014a judgment \naddressing a challenged government action would \nlikely redress a plaintiff\u2019s asserted injury.  Bennett, \n520 U.S. at 169.  For example, if a regulation makes it \nunlawful \u201cfor soda manufacturers to use sugar,\u201d En-\nergy Future, 793 F.3d at 144, a plaintiff may establish \nstanding by pointing to the regulation and introducing \n\n \n34 \n \nevidence that it sells sugar and that some sodas con-\ntain sugar.  But not every case will be that \u201csimple\u201d \n(Pet. Br. 47).  If the regulation instead made it unlaw-\nful only for soda manufacturers to sell more than 80% \nof their beverages with sugar, and the administrative \nrecord established that sugar-free sodas already rep-\nresented 30% of the market before the regulation, that \nplaintiff would have to do more to establish redressa-\nbility. \nAs discussed above, petitioners\u2019 case does not re-\nsemble the \u201csimple\u201d scenarios, primarily because no \none challenged EPA\u2019s initial decision to grant a waiver \nin 2013.  In the ensuing decade, automakers made \nenormous investments in zero-emission vehicles and \nconsumer tastes evolved.  By May 2022, it was not at \nall clear that the presence or absence of the Advanced \nClean Cars I standards would have a determinative or \ncoercive effect on the mix of cars sold by automakers.  \nSee supra pp. 20-22.  Market forces and internal goals \nwere pushing automakers to continue their shift to-\nward electric vehicles, regardless of California\u2019s regu-\nlations.  Pet. App. 24a n.8.  Those circumstances \ndemanded actual evidence showing redressability\u2014\nnot unsupported assertions about \u201ccommon sense and \nbasic economics.\u201d  Pet. Br. 30. \nb.  Petitioners\u2019 contrary arguments demonstrate a \nmisunderstanding of this Court\u2019s precedent.  It is true \n(Pet. Br. 27) that redressability involves \u201cthe relation-\nship between \u2018the judicial relief requested\u2019 and the \u2018in-\njury\u2019 suffered.\u201d  California v. Texas, 593 U.S. 659, 671 \n(2021).  But the necessary relationship is lacking \nwhere the plaintiff fails to prove that \u201cdepress[ed] \nmarket demand\u201d for its product in fact \u201cflows from\u201d \n(Pet. Br. 27) the challenged regulation, and that vaca-\ntur would likely lead to increased demand. \n\n \n35 \n \nPetitioners also contend that, \u201c[a]s far as redressa-\nbility is concerned, . . . Article III\u2019s demands are the \nsame whether the plaintiff is directly or indirectly reg-\nulated.\u201d  Pet. Br. 27.  Justice Scalia long ago rejected \nthat notion in an opinion for the Court.  When a plain-\ntiff is not the direct object of the government action it \nchallenges, \u201cstanding is not precluded, but it is ordi-\nnarily \u2018substantially more difficult\u2019 to establish.\u201d  \nLujan, 504 U.S. at 562.  That is because the plaintiff \nmust \u201cadduce facts\u201d creating a likelihood that the \nthird parties who are directly regulated will make \n\u201cchoices . . . in such manner as to produce causation \nand permit redressability of injury.\u201d  Id.  Petitioners \ndid not do so here. \n3. Petitioners\u2019 policy arguments do not \njustify their rule \nPetitioners eventually resort to a series of \u201cpolicy\u201d \narguments.  Pet. Br. 41; see id. at 41-45.  They first \nargue that the decision below effectively \u201crequire[s] \nthe endorsement of a directly regulated third party be-\nfore an indirectly regulated party can sue.\u201d  Id. at 38.  \nThat would be a problem, they contend, because di-\nrectly regulated entities often will be unwilling or un-\nable to assist indirectly affected challengers.  See id. \nat 42.  But the court of appeals did not require peti-\ntioners to \u201cprovid[e] affidavits from automakers\u201d as a \ncondition of standing.  Id. at 38.  The court\u2019s opinion \nshowed a willingness to consider a variety of other ma-\nterials (if identified by the parties), including com-\nments in the administrative record and public \nstatements from industry participants.  See Pet. App. \n23a-24a, 28a.   \nAnd there are a range of evidentiary sources be-\nyond \u201caffidavits from automakers\u201d that bear on how \nautomakers would likely respond to a vacatur in 2022.  \n\n \n36 \n \nThe state respondents gathered facts relevant to \nstanding from public databases, news articles, securi-\nties and court filings, government reports, and corpo-\nrate announcements.  See, e.g., J.A. 190-206.  Just a \nfew days after the oral argument caused petitioners to \ntake the jurisdictional questions seriously, petitioners \nlocated retired auto executives to file supplemental \ndeclarations that purported to speak authoritatively \nabout automakers\u2019 capabilities and practices.  See J.A. \n213, 218.19  In similar contexts, other litigants have \nrelied on a variety of sources.  See, e.g., C.A. Ohio Br. \nAdd. 37-54 (economist\u2019s declaration); Duke Pwr. Co. v. \nCarolina Envt\u2019l Study Grp., Inc., 438 U.S. 59, 75-76 \n(1978) (congressional testimony); Competitive Enter. \nInst. v. FCC, 970 F.3d 372, 383 (D.C. Cir. 2020) (ex-\npert\u2019s analysis); Competitive Enter. Inst. v. NHTSA, \n901 F.2d 107, 117 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (testimony from ad-\nministrative hearing).   \nThe decision below thus does not \u201ccreat[e] artifi-\ncially high evidentiary barriers.\u201d  Pet. Br. 35.  And it \ndoes not obstruct \u201csuits by unregulated plaintiffs who \nare adversely affected by an agency\u2019s regulation of oth-\ners.\u201d  Corner Post, Inc. v. Bd. of Governors of Fed. Rsrv. \nSys., 603 U.S. 799, 826 (2024) (Kavanaugh, J., concur-\nring).  It simply ensures that any such suits are \n \n19 Those declarations are not before this Court because the court \nof appeals held that petitioners failed to establish good cause for \ntheir untimely filing, see Pet. App. 31a-32a, and petitioners did \nnot seek review of that ruling, see Pet. I; State Opp. 14-15.  In any \nevent, the declarants did not account for 2022 market conditions.  \nSee J.A. 213-222.  As to redressability, they merely asserted that \nautomakers \u201clikely would change their production, pricing, \nand/or distribution plans for Model Year 2025\u201d absent Califor-\nnia\u2019s standards.  J.A. 215, 220.  They offered no supporting de-\ntails, and focused instead on the distinct question of how quickly \nautomakers could change their fleets and prices. \n\n \n37 \n \nbrought by plaintiffs who are, in fact, adversely af-\nfected by the challenged action and would benefit from \na favorable decision.     \nNext, petitioners argue that the \u201cdecision below \ncreates troubling incentives for agencies.\u201d  Pet. Br. 43.  \nThey assert that agencies may now \u201ctarget entire in-\ndustries with crippling burdens so long as they act \nthrough a conduit and placate that conduit.\u201d  Id.20  \nAgain, however, a plaintiff whose sales are crippled as \nthe result of an agency action can invoke numerous \nsources to demonstrate a likelihood that vacatur \nwould increase sales.  Nor does this case present any \nvalid concern about \u201cencourag[ing] agencies to act over \nshorter time horizons.\u201d  Pet. Br. 44.  The underlying \nwaiver was granted in 2013 and addressed standards \nthat increased in stringency through model year 2025.  \nAny jurisdictional difficulties petitioners confronted \nresulted primarily from their own choice not to chal-\nlenge the original 2013 action.  See supra p. 18 n.7. \nFinally, petitioners argue that the court of appeals \n\u201ccreate[d] a one-way ratchet in favor of the regulator \nover the regulated\u201d by requiring petitioners to intro-\nduce evidence of standing.  Pet. Br. 44.  They contrast \nthat requirement with the principle that \u201c[a] State will \n \n20 Petitioners note that several automakers entered voluntary \nagreements with California in 2020 to continue producing more \nlow- and zero-emission vehicles.  See Pet. App. 13a-14a.  But that \nwas not a \u201ctroubling\u201d effort by EPA to \u201cinsulate\u201d the \u201centire in-\ndustr[y]\u201d from \u201creview.\u201d  Pet. Br. 43.  And petitioners \nacknowledge that \u201cmany\u201d other automakers did not enter any \nsuch agreement.  Id. at 37.  Nothing prevented petitioners from \nattempting to introduce evidence showing that the non-partici-\npating automakers would likely change their fleets in response to \na vacatur of the reinstatement. \n\n \n38 \n \nalways have \u2018a legitimate interest in the continued en-\nforceability of its own statutes.\u2019\u201d  Id. (quoting Maine v. \nTaylor, 477 U.S. 131, 137 (1986)).  But state plaintiffs \ndo introduce evidence where necessary to show that a \nfavorable judgment would redress their injuries.  See, \ne.g., Dep\u2019t of Com., 588 U.S. at 767-768.  And this \nCourt\u2019s recognition that sovereigns have a protectable \ninterest in effectuating their own statutes hardly \namounts to \u201cbad policy.\u201d  Pet. Br. 41; see Maryland v. \nKing, 567 U.S. 1301, 1303 (2012) (Roberts, C.J., in \nchambers); Maine, 477 U.S. at 137. \nThe more relevant policy consideration is the one \nunderlying Article III:  that federal courts have lim-\nited jurisdiction, and a party seeking to invoke that \njurisdiction must show that its claim falls within those \nlimits.  That policy, which reflects the Framers\u2019 vision \nof the proper role of courts in our democratic system, \nsee All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 380, requires \naffirmance here.   \nB. Unsupported Predictions About the Effect \nof a Judgment on a Third Party Are Insuf-\nficient to Establish Redressability \nPetitioners\u2019 alternative theory for why they did not \nneed to introduce evidence of redressability fails for \nsimilar reasons.  They contend that plaintiffs can es-\ntablish standing simply by asserting that the \u201ceffects \nof the challenged government action on third parties\u201d \nare \u201cpredictable\u201d\u2014and that \u201cno more is needed.\u201d  Pet. \nBr. 18.  The cases petitioners invoke for that argument \nactually demonstrate the opposite.   \nPetitioners portray Department of Commerce as \nholding that unsupported inferences and predictions \nabout \u201cthird-party behavior . . . can suffice\u201d to estab-\nlish standing.  Pet. Br. 30; see id. at 31.  In truth, that \ndecision examined whether the plaintiffs \u201cha[d] met \n\n \n39 \n \ntheir burden of showing that third parties will likely \nreact in predictable ways\u201d to a citizenship question on \nthe 2020 census, and thereby cause harm to the plain-\ntiffs.  Dep\u2019t of Com., 588 U.S. at 768 (emphasis added).  \nThe Court answered that question in the affirmative \nonly after reviewing the district court\u2019s \u201cfindings of \nfact\u201d\u2014based on extensive \u201cevidence\u201d\u2014which \u201cestab-\nlished a sufficient likelihood that the reinstatement of \na citizenship question\u201d would depress census response \nrates.  Id. at 767; see New York v. Dep\u2019t of Com., 351 F. \nSupp. 3d 502, 578-581 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (describing ex-\npert testimony, statistical data, and agency memo-\nranda).  The Court did not rely on \u201cspeculation\u201d or \npredictions alone.  Dep\u2019t of Com., 588 U.S. at 768.21 \nNor can petitioners dismiss the significance of the \nevidence before the Court in Department of Commerce \non the ground that it merely recounted \u201chistorical \npractice.\u201d  Pet. Br. 31.  The plaintiffs in that case did \nnot just reference the result of questions on prior cen-\nsuses.  They introduced detailed evidence that \u201cover-\nwhelmingly support[ed] the conclusion that the \naddition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census \nwill cause a significant net differential decline in self-\nresponse rates among noncitizen households.\u201d  New \nYork, 351 F. Supp. 3d at 578 (emphasis added). \nThe remaining authorities discussed by petitioners \n(Pet. Br. 31) do not advance their theory either.  The \nstanding analysis in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. \n497, 526 (2007), turned on evidence that included \u201cpe-\ntitioners\u2019 uncontested affidavits.\u201d  That evidence \n \n21 See also California, 593 U.S. at 678 (explaining that the plain-\ntiffs in Department of Commerce \u201crelied not only on \u2018the predict-\nable effect of Government action on the decisions of third parties\u2019 \nbut also on comprehensive studies, rather than mere \u2018specula-\ntion\u2019\u201d). \n\n \n40 \n \nshowed that \u201cthe United States transportation sector \nemit[ted] . . .  more than 6% of worldwide carbon diox-\nide emissions,\u201d id. at 524; that there was \u201ca causal con-\nnection between manmade greenhouse gas emissions \nand global warming,\u201d id. at 523, see id. at 525; and \nthat \u201c[a] reduction in domestic emissions\u201d resulting \nfrom the requested relief \u201cwould slow the pace of \nglobal emissions increases,\u201d providing partial redress \nfor petitioners\u2019 undisputed injuries, id. at 526; see id. \nat 522-523.22  In Skyline Wesleyan Church v. Califor-\nnia Department of Managed Health Care, 968 F.3d \n738, 750 (9th Cir. 2020), the plaintiff similarly offered \n\u201cevidence\u201d that regulatory enforcement had caused \nhealth insurers to abandon restrictions on abortion \ncoverage.  Specifically, \u201cseven insurers had offered \nplans with abortion coverage restrictions\u201d consistent \nwith plaintiff\u2019s religious beliefs, then \u201call seven com-\nplied\u201d with a regulator\u2019s warning to stop offering such \nplans.  Id. at 750.  Both decisions thus turned on ac-\ntual evidence, not unsupported predictions. \nPetitioners nonetheless advance a blanket rule \nthat no evidence is required if \u201cthe behavior of third \nparties is predictable rather than speculative.\u201d  Pet. \nBr. 30.  They further contend that only \u201cthree \ncircumstances\u201d exist in which third-party behavior is \nsufficiently speculative to require evidence of redress-\nability:  (i) where a plaintiff\u2019s theory relies on \u201c\u2018coun-\nterintuitive\u2019 assumptions,\u201d  id. at 32 (citing California, \n593 U.S. at 678); (ii) where it relies on an attenuated \n\u201cchain of events,\u201d Pet. Br. 32 (citing All. for Hippo-\ncratic Med., 602 U.S. at 386); and (iii) where the \u201clegal \nimpact of a judicial decision is unclear,\u201d Pet. Br. 33 \n \n22 The Court also accorded a \u201cspecial solicitude\u201d to the state peti-\ntioners, which does not apply to the private petitioners here.  \nMassachusetts, 549 U.S. at 520. \n\n \n41 \n \n(citing Murthy, 603 U.S. at 72-73, Brackeen, 599 U.S. \nat 294, and Texas, 599 U.S. at 691 (Gorsuch, J., con-\ncurring in the judgment)). \nThose arguments profoundly misunderstand this \nCourt\u2019s standing doctrine.  Challengers must always \nidentify \u201cevidence\u201d proving \u201c\u2018specific facts\u2019\u201d that estab-\nlish standing.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561; see FW/PBS, \nInc. v. City of Dallas, 493 U.S. 215, 231 (1990).  And \nthis Court\u2019s analysis of standing is \u201cnot a \u2018mechanical \nexercise\u2019\u201d\u2014particularly when it comes to suits (like \nthis one) \u201cby unregulated parties against the govern-\nment.\u201d  All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 384.  In \nsome cases, \u201cfamiliar circumstances\u201d make standing \n\u201clikely,\u201d id., and a plaintiff might be able to meet its \nburden with less evidence.  In other cases, like those \nreferenced by petitioners, the Court has pointed to cir-\ncumstances calling for \u201cfar stronger evidence\u201d of cau-\nsation and redressability.  E.g., California, 593 U.S. at \n678.  But those circumstances are not the only ones in \nwhich plaintiffs are required to introduce any evi-\ndence.  \nPetitioners\u2019 own arguments illustrate the folly of \ntheir proposed rule.  Invoking Summers v. Earth Is-\nland Institute, 555 U.S. 488, 494 (2009), petitioners ar-\ngue (Pet. Br. 34) that \u201cit is predictable that when the \ngovernment \u2018regulates parks, national forests, or bod-\nies of water,\u2019 it will affect the users of those natural \nresources.\u201d  \u201cIn all such cases,\u201d id., petitioners assert, \nno \u201c[r]ecord evidence is required,\u201d id. at 30.  But Sum-\nmers held exactly the opposite.  It reiterated that a \nplaintiff \u201cbears the burden of showing that he has \nstanding.\u201d  Summers, 555 U.S. at 493.  The Court in-\nsisted on particular evidence showing that the chal-\nlenged regulations would affect a specific site that at \nleast one of plaintiffs\u2019 members had \u201ca specific and \n\n \n42 \n \nconcrete plan\u201d to visit.  Id. at 495.  And it rejected a \n\u201chitherto unheard-of test\u201d that would premise stand-\ning on a \u201cprobability\u201d that \u201csome (unidentified) mem-\nbers have planned to visit some (unidentified) small \nparcels affected by the Forest Service\u2019s procedures and \nwill suffer (unidentified) concrete harm as a result.\u201d  \nId. at 497-498.  That sort of predictive approach\u2014un-\nsupported by concrete evidence\u2014would \u201cmake a mock-\nery of\u201d the Court\u2019s \u201cprior cases.\u201d  Id. at 498. \nC. The Duration of the Waiver Does Not, By \nItself, Establish Standing \nPetitioners also contend that they were excused \nfrom submitting evidence because the \u201cwaiver for cer-\ntain California standards does not sunset.\u201d  Pet. Br. \n19.  But the fact that the greenhouse-gas standards \nplateau starting in model year 2025, and continue at \nthe same levels in future years, supra p. 6, does not \nchange the analysis.   \n1.  Petitioners reason that because those standards \n\u201cdo not expire,\u201d a judicial vacatur \u201cwould necessarily \nhave some effect on vehicle pricing, production, or dis-\ntribution at some future point.\u201d  Pet. Br. 46 (emphasis \nadded).  This Court has previously rejected that kind \nof reasoning.  See Summers, 555 U.S. at 496 (state-\nments of \u201c\u2018some day\u2019 intentions,\u201d without \u201cany specifi-\ncation of when the some day will be,\u201d are insufficient \nto establish standing); Lujan, 504 U.S. at 564 (same).  \nAnd for good reason.  Statutes and regulations often \ndo not sunset.  The mere longevity of a challenged reg-\nulation is no substitute for \u201cspecific, concrete facts \ndemonstrating that\u201d the plaintiff is harmed by the \ngovernment\u2019s action and \u201cpersonally would benefit in \na tangible way from the court\u2019s intervention.\u201d  Warth, \n422 U.S. at 508. \n\n \n43 \n \nIn this case, moreover, the facts belie petitioners\u2019 \nassertion (Pet. Br. 19) that the duration of the green-\nhouse-gas standards eliminates any \u201cplausible dis-\npute\u201d about redressability.  By the time of this suit, \nsales of battery-electric vehicles far exceeded original \nforecasts, and those vehicles generate an outsized \nnumber of ZEV credits and produce very few green-\nhouse-gas emissions.  See supra pp. 6, 21-22.  Petition-\ners did not submit any evidence that the market would \nreverse course if those standards were no longer in \nplace in future years.  See supra p. 25. \nNor does the court of appeals\u2019 apparent misunder-\nstanding about the temporal scope of the greenhouse-\ngas standards (Pet. Br. 45) compel a different outcome.  \nThe court of appeals lacked jurisdiction because peti-\ntioners failed to introduce evidence showing that au-\ntomakers would likely respond to vacatur by \u201cselling \nfewer non-conventional vehicles or by altering the \nprices of their vehicles such that fewer non-conven-\ntional vehicles\u2014and more conventional vehicles\u2014\nwere sold.\u201d  Pet. App. 22a; see id. at 29a-30a.  The \ncourt\u2019s belief that the challenge before it \u201cconcern[ed] \nonly\u201d the reinstatement of the waiver \u201cas to Model \nYears 2017 through 2025,\u201d was a consideration that \n\u201cfurther complicated\u201d the redressability analysis.  Id. \nat 22a (emphasis added); see id. at 24a.  Setting aside \nthat additional perceived complication does not make \nup for petitioners\u2019 failure to introduce any evidence ad-\ndressing how automakers would likely respond to a \nvacatur in May 2022.  See U.S. Opp. 12-14. \n2.  Relatedly, petitioners fault EPA and the court \nof appeals for the court\u2019s \u201cincorrect\u201d premise about the \nduration of the waiver, Pet. Br. 45, which they contend \ncaused the court to improperly \u201cconflate[] mootness \n\n \n44 \n \nand redressability,\u201d id. at 39.  Those arguments are \npuzzling. \nIt has never been a secret that California\u2019s \u201cgreen-\nhouse-gas emission standards applied to model year \n2025 \u2018and subsequent.\u2019\u201d  Pet. Br. 45-46 (quoting J.A. \n50).  That was plainly described in the California Code \nof Regulations. See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \n\u00a7 1961.3(a)(1)(A); see also Cal. Code Regs., tit. 13, \n\u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2012) (similar wording in originally \nenacted ZEV provision).  Petitioners imply that the \nlower court\u2019s confusion about the duration of the \nwaiver arose because EPA failed to \u201ccandidly ex-\nplain[]\u201d the matter until the certiorari stage.  Pet. Br. \n45; see id. at 46.  But the more likely culprit was peti-\ntioners\u2019 opening brief below, which told the court that \npetitioners were challenging a program \u201ccover[ing] ve-\nhicles from model years 2015 through 2025.\u201d  C.A. Pri-\nvate Pet. Br. 9; see also C.A. Oral Arg. 33:55-34:13 \n(argument of petitioners\u2019 counsel that, to defeat stand-\ning, \u201cthe Government would need to come forward \nwith some evidence that [automakers have] now \nplanned around the restatement in a way that couldn\u2019t \nbe withdrawn by 2025\u201d). \nThe lack of clarity on this point was perhaps un-\nderstandable:  petitioners\u2019 central focus in this case \nhas always been on the ZEV standards, which will ex-\npire after model year 2025.  Pet. Br. 46.  That may be \nwhy petitioners urged this Court to resolve the merits \nof their statutory claim before \u201cCalifornia\u2019s waiver ex-\npires at the end of model year 2025,\u201d Pet. 26, even af-\nter they had belatedly acknowledged that the \ngreenhouse-gas standards apply to \u201cModel Years \n\u20182025 and subsequent,\u2019\u201d C.A. Private Pet. Proposed \nSupp. Br. 5.  But whatever the source of the confusion \n\n \n45 \n \nbelow, it did not matter to the ultimate outcome.  Re-\ngardless of the waiver\u2019s duration, petitioners failed to \nshow that automakers would respond to its reinstate-\nment (either sooner or later) by making changes that \nwould increase fuel sales.   \nIn the face of that failure, the court of appeals cor-\nrectly explained why its decision was based on stand-\ning, not mootness:  The jurisdictional problem was not \nthat petitioners\u2019 \u201cstanding arguments were sufficient \nwhen originally filed\u201d and then were \u201cmooted by the \npassage of time.\u201d  Pet. App. 25a; see generally Already, \nLLC v. Nike, Inc., 568 U.S. 85, 91 (2013).  Petitioners\u2019 \n\u201cstanding arguments were deficient from the start.\u201d  \nPet. App. 25a.  By the time petitioners filed their chal-\nlenge in May 2022, shifts in consumer demand and \nother transformations in the market made it specula-\ntive (at best) that vacating the reinstatement would \nlead to increased fuel sales in the future.  Petitioners \nnever even attempted to introduce evidence demon-\nstrating that vacatur of the reinstatement would have \nthe effects on automakers that they predicted.  Pet. \nApp. 29a-30a.   \nD. Petitioners\u2019 Post Hoc Attempts to Identify \nEvidence on Redressability Fail to Estab-\nlish Standing \nFinally, petitioners argue that if they \u201cwere legally \nrequired to produce record evidence to support re-\ndressability, plenty such evidence existed.\u201d  Pet. \nBr. 37.  But the few documents that petitioners cited \nin the court of appeals did not establish any likelihood \nthat a vacatur in 2022 would increase fuel sales, as \ndetailed in Part I.C above.  And the additional materi-\nals petitioners now point this Court to would not have \nestablished redressability even if petitioners had in-\nvoked them in a timely fashion below. \n\n \n46 \n \nPetitioners first highlight (Pet. Br. 38) a statement \nfrom an appendix to California\u2019s 2021 comment letter \nregarding the reinstatement.  See J.A. 84.  But that \nstatement relied on forecasts from 2017.  See J.A. 85 \nn.17 (citing January 2017 analysis of regulation com-\npliance scenarios); id. at 85 n.18 (citing February 2017 \nmodeling scenario).  By 2022, the earlier projections \nhad been overtaken by actual events.  See J.A. 191 (na-\ntional market share of zero-emission vehicles \u201calmost \ntripled\u201d in the period \u201cbetween 2020 and the third \nquarter of 2022\u201d). \nPetitioners also invoke declarations that the state \nrespondents filed along with their motion to intervene, \nshortly after petitioners initiated this suit.  See Pet. \nBr. 13, 34.  Those declarations (like petitioners\u2019) as-\nserted a conclusory \u201cexpect[ation]\u201d that additional \ngasoline-fueled vehicles would be sold if California\u2019s \nstandards were not in place.  J.A. 110, 111; see id. at \n115-116.  The lack of any details or contemporaneous \nevidence for those assertions reflected both time con-\nstraints (the intervention declarations were signed \nfour days after the case commenced) and the reality \nthat the States\u2019 standing and entitlement to intervene \nwere independently established for other reasons.  Cf. \nKing, 567 U.S. at 1303 (reasoning that a State suffers \n\u201congoing irreparable harm\u201d any time it \u201cis enjoined by \na court from effectuating . . . a duly enacted statute\u201d). \nAnother document referenced by petitioners (Pet. \nBr. 47) is outside the record and post-dates the deci-\nsion below:  EPA\u2019s recent request for public comment \non its proposal to incorporate the greenhouse-gas \nstandards of the Advanced Clean Cars I program into \nCalifornia\u2019s state implementation plan.  See 89 Fed. \nReg. 82,553 (Oct. 11, 2024); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7407.  To be \nsure, the underlying state estimates referenced in that \n\n \n47 \n \nproposal (see 89 Fed. Reg. at 82,557 & nn.19-20) are \npart of the record, because California submitted them \nto EPA in 2021 in connection with the reinstatement \nproceedings.  See C.A. J.A. 276.  But petitioners never \ninvoked those submissions below.  And the estimates \ntook as their baseline a projection of zero-emission ve-\nhicle penetration based on 2019 data, which did not \nanticipate the dramatic increase in sales in the follow-\ning years.23   \nNone of the materials that petitioners belatedly \nreference could have satisfied their burden to submit \nevidence about how the market would respond to va-\ncatur of the reinstatement in May 2022.  And the fact \nthat they were not \u201cset forth\u201d as \u201cthe basis for the \nclaim of standing\u201d below poses another insuperable \nobstacle for petitioners.  D.C. Cir. R. 28(a)(7).  As this \nCourt recently reminded litigants, \u201c\u2018judges are not like \npigs, hunting for truffles buried in the record.\u2019\u201d  \nMurthy, 603 U.S. at 67 n.7 (alterations omitted).  The \ncourt of appeals could not reasonably be expected to \nfocus on a few sentences scattered across thousands of \npages of record materials, which were never raised in \npetitioners\u2019 briefs.  Nor could it be expected to recall \nisolated assertions in two declarations, filed in support \nof one of five unopposed motions to intervene, that \nwere disposed of by the Clerk more than a year before \noral argument.  See C.A. Order (June 30, 2022). \nIn the end, petitioners are right that this case is \n\u201csimple\u201d (Pet. Br. 47)\u2014but not in the way they sug-\ngest.  They had the burden to introduce evidence es-\ntablishing that their claim was redressable.  Instead \n \n23  See C.A. J.A. 277 (explaining reliance on \u201cEMFAC 2021\u201d \nmodel); Cal. Air Res. Bd., EMFAC 2021 Volume III Technical \nDocument, at 6 (April 2021), https://tinyurl.com/2wsxz4uy (ex-\nplaining use of DMV data through 2019). \n\n \n48 \n \nof meeting that obligation head-on, they treated re-\ndressability as an afterthought\u2014relying on assump-\ntions and conclusory assertions, supplemented only by \noutdated projections.  And when confronted with cur-\nrent evidence from the state respondents undermining \ntheir assumption that vacatur of the reinstatement in \nMay 2022 would lead to increased fuel sales, petition-\ners offered no evidentiary response.  Because petition-\ners failed to introduce specific facts and evidence \nestablishing a likelihood of redressability, the court of \nappeals properly held that it could not reach the mer-\nits. \n\n \n49 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be af-\nfirmed. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \nROB BONTA \nAttorney General of California \nMICHAEL J.

U.S. Bank N.A., \n590 U.S. 538, 547 (2020).  Article III standing should \nnot be complicated here.  The question is whether a \nparty has standing to challenge a government action \nthat works by depressing the market for that party\u2019s \nproducts.  To ask the question is to answer it.  Private \nschools have standing to challenge a law prohibiting \nparents from sending their children to private school.  \nPublishers have standing to challenge a law banning \nbookstores from selling their books.  And here, produc-\ners and sellers of liquid fuels have standing to chal-\nlenge a rule requiring automakers to make cars that \nuse less liquid fuel, or none at all. \n\n2 \n \nThis lawsuit arises from the Biden Administration\u2019s \nefforts to force the electrification of the Nation\u2019s vehi-\ncle fleet.  In 2021, President Biden announced his \u201cgoal \nthat 50 percent of all new passenger cars and light \ntrucks sold in 2030 be zero-emission vehicles,\u201d as part \nof his administration\u2019s efforts to \u201caddress the climate \ncrisis.\u201d  86 Fed. Reg. 43,583, 43,583 (Aug. 5, 2021).  At \nthe time, electric vehicles made up around 4% of the \nnew automobile market.  So to fast-forward to the re-\nsult the President wanted\u2014fewer combustion-engine \nvehicles on the road and less liquid fuel consumed\u2014the \nfederal government pursued a multi-pronged strategy \nof federal and state regulation.  \nOn the state front, EPA turned to Section 209 of  \nthe Clean Air Act.  That unique provision broadly \npreempts States from adopting their own motor-vehicle \nemission standards.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(a).  But it per-\nmits California\u2014and California alone\u2014to obtain a nar-\nrow waiver from federal preemption.  Id. \u00a7 7543(b).  To \nreceive a special preemption waiver, California must \ndemonstrate that it \u201cneed[s]\u201d its own emission stand-\nards \u201cto meet compelling and extraordinary condi-\ntions.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7543(b)(1)(B).   \nFor decades, EPA granted Section 209(b) preemp-\ntion waivers to California to address the State\u2019s local \npollution problems, such as smog.  In recent years, \nhowever, different administrations have flip-flopped on \nwhether Section 209(b) permits EPA to grant Califor-\nnia a waiver to tackle global climate change.  Most rel-\nevant here is EPA\u2019s 2022 flip, in which it reinstated a \nonce-granted, once-revoked waiver for California\u2019s \n\u201cAdvanced Clean Cars\u201d program.  That program in-\ncludes a set of stringent greenhouse-gas emission \nstandards, as well as a mandate requiring automakers \nto meet a 22% zero-emission-vehicle target by model \n\n3 \n \nyear 2025.  Pet. App. 55a-57a.  California\u2019s governor \nexplained that the program works \u201cto end our reliance \non fossil fuels.\u201d1  \nPetitioners immediately challenged EPA\u2019s rein-\nstated waiver.  Petitioners are entities (and associa-\ntions of entities) that produce or sell liquid fuels and \nthe raw materials used to make them.  They challenged \nEPA\u2019s approval of California\u2019s standards as incon-\nsistent with the major-questions doctrine and the plain \ntext of Section 209(b), which allows for a special Cali-\nfornia exemption only for problems localized to and \nsolvable in California\u2014not for global issues like cli-\nmate change.  To establish their standing, petitioners \nsubmitted 14 declarations explaining that California\u2019s \nstandards target their products and will result in lower \nsales.  \nThe court of appeals held that petitioners lacked Ar-\nticle III standing.  The court theorized that vacating \nEPA\u2019s waiver, and thus eliminating California\u2019s coer-\ncive regulations, might not have any effect on car man-\nufacturers\u2019 decisions about the composition of their \nfleets, given market demand.  As a result, the court \nconcluded that petitioners had not shown that a favor-\nable decision would redress their economic injuries.  \nPet. App. 29a. \nThat cannot be right.  The entire point of Califor-\nnia\u2019s Advanced Clean Cars program is to reduce de-\nmand for petitioners\u2019 products:  the regulations are de-\nsigned to compel automakers to change the kind of ve-\nhicles they produce so as to decrease the amount of liq-\nuid fuel burned by drivers.  No one disputes that is the \naim of California\u2019s standards.  It is why EPA praised \n \n1 \nGovernor Gavin Newsom, Governor Newsom Statement on \nBiden Administration\u2019s Restoration of California\u2019s Clean Car \nWaiver (Mar. 9, 2022), https://perma.cc/T92E-2XM8. \n\n4 \n \nits waiver as a \u201ccritical step to confront the climate cri-\nsis.\u201d2  Eliminating the waiver and wiping California\u2019s \nAdvanced Clean Cars program off the books would \nthus be likely to remedy at least one dollar of petition-\ners\u2019 economic injuries.  Redressability here should not \nbe more complicated than that. \nThere are three doctrinal paths to that com-\nmonsense conclusion.  First, and most simply, redress-\nability is satisfied because a favorable decision would \n\u201cremove a regulatory hurdle\u201d to the sale of petitioners\u2019 \nproducts.  Energy Future Coal. v. EPA, 793 F.3d 141, \n144 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (Kavanaugh, J.); see Bennett \nv. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 169 (1997).  Second, even absent \nthat categorical rule, challengers to a government ac-\ntion may establish redressability by relying on the ac-\ntion\u2019s \u201cpredictable effect\u201d on third parties.  Depart-\nment of Commerce v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 768 \n(2019).  It is entirely predictable that California\u2019s reg-\nulation of automakers would \u201ccause downstream or up-\nstream economic injuries to others in the chain\u201d\u2014 \nespecially petitioners.  FDA v. Alliance for Hippo-\ncratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 384 (2024).  Third, at a mini-\nmum petitioners\u2019 injuries are redressable because \nEPA has now clarified that its waiver has no expiration \ndate.  Not even the court below doubted that setting \naside a perpetual waiver would likely affect automaker \nbehavior at some point in the future. \nArticle III\u2019s redressability requirement exists to \nalign injuries and remedies, so that litigants do not sue \nthe wrong parties and courts do not issue overly broad \n \n2 \nEPA, News Release:  What They Are Saying:  EPA Restora-\ntion of California Waiver Will Support State Climate Action, Im-\nprove Air Quality, and Advance our Electric Vehicle Future (Mar. \n11, 2022), https://perma.cc/896Q-N2X5 (EPA News Release).  \n\n5 \n \nrelief or advisory opinions.  The redressability require-\nment does not exist to block the intended targets of \ngovernment regulation from challenging the very reg-\nulations that threaten their existence, so that courts \ncan avoid deciding controversial or difficult questions.  \nThis Court should reverse. \nOPINION BELOW \nThe opinion of the court of appeals (Pet. App. \n1a-49a) is reported at 98 F.4th 288.  The EPA order \nunder review (Pet. App. 50a-285a) is available at \n87 Fed. Reg. 14,332. \nJURISDICTION \nThe court of appeals entered judgment on April 9, \n2024.  The petition for a writ of certiorari was filed on \nJuly 2, 2024, and granted on December 13, 2024.  This \nCourt has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nRelevant statutory provisions are reproduced in an \nappendix to this brief. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Statutory Background \n\u201cThe Clean Air Act regulates pollution-generating \nemissions from both stationary sources, such as facto-\nries and powerplants, and moving sources, such as \ncars, trucks, and aircraft.\u201d  Utility Air Regul. Grp.  \nv. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 308 (2014).  This case concerns  \nTitle II of the Act, which authorizes EPA to regulate \nemissions from new motor vehicles.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7521, \n7543.   \nTo effectuate a (mostly) uniform federal emissions \nregime, Section 209(a) of Title II broadly prohibits \nStates from \u201cadopt[ing] or attempt[ing] to enforce any \n\n6 \n \nstandard relating to the control of emissions from new \nmotor vehicles.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(a).  This preemption \nprovision prevents \u201can anarchic patchwork of federal \nand state regulatory programs, a prospect which \nthreatened to create nightmares for the manufactur-\ners.\u201d  Motor Equip. Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 627 F.2d 1095, \n1109 (D.C. Cir. 1979).   \nCongress created one exception to Section 209(a)\u2019s \nbroad preemption of state emission standards:  Section \n209(b), which authorizes EPA to \u201cwaive\u201d preemption \nfor certain standards adopted by California.  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7543(b).3  Congress granted California this special \nstatus because of the State\u2019s \u201cunique problems\u201d with \nsmog and other local issues caused by so-called \u201ccrite-\nria\u201d pollutants like particulate matter.  H.R. Rep. No. \n90-728, at 22 (1967).  In particular, California\u2019s atypical \n\u201cgeography and prevailing wind patterns,\u201d together \nwith its unusually large number of vehicles, made smog \na more persistent problem there than elsewhere.   \n49 Fed. Reg. 18,887, 18,890 (May 3, 1984) (citing  \n113 Cong. Rec. 30,948 (Nov. 2, 1967)). \nCongress limited California\u2019s ability to separately \nregulate emissions in several ways.  The onus is first \non California, which must \u201cdetermine[] that the State \nstandards will be, in the aggregate, at least as protec-\ntive of public health and welfare as applicable Federal \nstandards.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(b)(1).  After the State \nmakes that determination and files an application, \nEPA must deny a waiver if it finds that (1) California\u2019s \n \n3 \nSection 209(b) does not name California.  It instead makes a \npreemption waiver possible for \u201cany State\u201d that had adopted certain \nstandards \u201cprior to March 30, 1966.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(b)(1).  But as \nCongress was aware, California was the only State that met this cri-\nterion and \u201cis thus the only state eligible for a waiver.\u201d  Motor Equip. \nMfrs.

U.S. Bank N.A., \n590 U.S. 538, 547 (2020).  Article III standing should \nnot be complicated here.  The question is whether a \nparty has standing to challenge a government action \nthat works by depressing the market for that party\u2019s \nproducts.  To ask the question is to answer it.  Private \nschools have standing to challenge a law prohibiting \nparents from sending their children to private school.  \nPublishers have standing to challenge a law banning \nbookstores from selling their books.  And here, produc-\ners and sellers of liquid fuels have standing to chal-\nlenge a rule requiring automakers to make cars that \nuse less liquid fuel, or none at all. \n\n2 \n \nThis lawsuit arises from the Biden Administration\u2019s \nefforts to force the electrification of the Nation\u2019s vehi-\ncle fleet.  In 2021, President Biden announced his \u201cgoal \nthat 50 percent of all new passenger cars and light \ntrucks sold in 2030 be zero-emission vehicles,\u201d as part \nof his administration\u2019s efforts to \u201caddress the climate \ncrisis.\u201d  86 Fed. Reg. 43,583, 43,583 (Aug. 5, 2021).  At \nthe time, electric vehicles made up around 4% of the \nnew automobile market.  So to fast-forward to the re-\nsult the President wanted\u2014fewer combustion-engine \nvehicles on the road and less liquid fuel consumed\u2014the \nfederal government pursued a multi-pronged strategy \nof federal and state regulation.  \nOn the state front, EPA turned to Section 209 of  \nthe Clean Air Act.  That unique provision broadly \npreempts States from adopting their own motor-vehicle \nemission standards.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(a).  But it per-\nmits California\u2014and California alone\u2014to obtain a nar-\nrow waiver from federal preemption.  Id. \u00a7 7543(b).  To \nreceive a special preemption waiver, California must \ndemonstrate that it \u201cneed[s]\u201d its own emission stand-\nards \u201cto meet compelling and extraordinary condi-\ntions.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7543(b)(1)(B).   \nFor decades, EPA granted Section 209(b) preemp-\ntion waivers to California to address the State\u2019s local \npollution problems, such as smog.  In recent years, \nhowever, different administrations have flip-flopped on \nwhether Section 209(b) permits EPA to grant Califor-\nnia a waiver to tackle global climate change.  Most rel-\nevant here is EPA\u2019s 2022 flip, in which it reinstated a \nonce-granted, once-revoked waiver for California\u2019s \n\u201cAdvanced Clean Cars\u201d program.  That program in-\ncludes a set of stringent greenhouse-gas emission \nstandards, as well as a mandate requiring automakers \nto meet a 22% zero-emission-vehicle target by model \n\n3 \n \nyear 2025.  Pet. App. 55a-57a.  California\u2019s governor \nexplained that the program works \u201cto end our reliance \non fossil fuels.\u201d1  \nPetitioners immediately challenged EPA\u2019s rein-\nstated waiver.  Petitioners are entities (and associa-\ntions of entities) that produce or sell liquid fuels and \nthe raw materials used to make them.  They challenged \nEPA\u2019s approval of California\u2019s standards as incon-\nsistent with the major-questions doctrine and the plain \ntext of Section 209(b), which allows for a special Cali-\nfornia exemption only for problems localized to and \nsolvable in California\u2014not for global issues like cli-\nmate change.  To establish their standing, petitioners \nsubmitted 14 declarations explaining that California\u2019s \nstandards target their products and will result in lower \nsales.  \nThe court of appeals held that petitioners lacked Ar-\nticle III standing.  The court theorized that vacating \nEPA\u2019s waiver, and thus eliminating California\u2019s coer-\ncive regulations, might not have any effect on car man-\nufacturers\u2019 decisions about the composition of their \nfleets, given market demand.  As a result, the court \nconcluded that petitioners had not shown that a favor-\nable decision would redress their economic injuries.  \nPet. App. 29a. \nThat cannot be right.  The entire point of Califor-\nnia\u2019s Advanced Clean Cars program is to reduce de-\nmand for petitioners\u2019 products:  the regulations are de-\nsigned to compel automakers to change the kind of ve-\nhicles they produce so as to decrease the amount of liq-\nuid fuel burned by drivers.  No one disputes that is the \naim of California\u2019s standards.  It is why EPA praised \n \n1 \nGovernor Gavin Newsom, Governor Newsom Statement on \nBiden Administration\u2019s Restoration of California\u2019s Clean Car \nWaiver (Mar. 9, 2022), https://perma.cc/T92E-2XM8. \n\n4 \n \nits waiver as a \u201ccritical step to confront the climate cri-\nsis.\u201d2  Eliminating the waiver and wiping California\u2019s \nAdvanced Clean Cars program off the books would \nthus be likely to remedy at least one dollar of petition-\ners\u2019 economic injuries.  Redressability here should not \nbe more complicated than that. \nThere are three doctrinal paths to that com-\nmonsense conclusion.  First, and most simply, redress-\nability is satisfied because a favorable decision would \n\u201cremove a regulatory hurdle\u201d to the sale of petitioners\u2019 \nproducts.  Energy Future Coal. v. EPA, 793 F.3d 141, \n144 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (Kavanaugh, J.); see Bennett \nv. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 169 (1997).  Second, even absent \nthat categorical rule, challengers to a government ac-\ntion may establish redressability by relying on the ac-\ntion\u2019s \u201cpredictable effect\u201d on third parties.  Depart-\nment of Commerce v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 768 \n(2019).  It is entirely predictable that California\u2019s reg-\nulation of automakers would \u201ccause downstream or up-\nstream economic injuries to others in the chain\u201d\u2014 \nespecially petitioners.  FDA v. Alliance for Hippo-\ncratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 384 (2024).  Third, at a mini-\nmum petitioners\u2019 injuries are redressable because \nEPA has now clarified that its waiver has no expiration \ndate.  Not even the court below doubted that setting \naside a perpetual waiver would likely affect automaker \nbehavior at some point in the future. \nArticle III\u2019s redressability requirement exists to \nalign injuries and remedies, so that litigants do not sue \nthe wrong parties and courts do not issue overly broad \n \n2 \nEPA, News Release:  What They Are Saying:  EPA Restora-\ntion of California Waiver Will Support State Climate Action, Im-\nprove Air Quality, and Advance our Electric Vehicle Future (Mar. \n11, 2022), https://perma.cc/896Q-N2X5 (EPA News Release).  \n\n5 \n \nrelief or advisory opinions.  The redressability require-\nment does not exist to block the intended targets of \ngovernment regulation from challenging the very reg-\nulations that threaten their existence, so that courts \ncan avoid deciding controversial or difficult questions.  \nThis Court should reverse. \nOPINION BELOW \nThe opinion of the court of appeals (Pet. App. \n1a-49a) is reported at 98 F.4th 288.  The EPA order \nunder review (Pet. App. 50a-285a) is available at \n87 Fed. Reg. 14,332. \nJURISDICTION \nThe court of appeals entered judgment on April 9, \n2024.  The petition for a writ of certiorari was filed on \nJuly 2, 2024, and granted on December 13, 2024.  This \nCourt has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nRelevant statutory provisions are reproduced in an \nappendix to this brief. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Statutory Background \n\u201cThe Clean Air Act regulates pollution-generating \nemissions from both stationary sources, such as facto-\nries and powerplants, and moving sources, such as \ncars, trucks, and aircraft.\u201d  Utility Air Regul. Grp.  \nv. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 308 (2014).  This case concerns  \nTitle II of the Act, which authorizes EPA to regulate \nemissions from new motor vehicles.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7521, \n7543.   \nTo effectuate a (mostly) uniform federal emissions \nregime, Section 209(a) of Title II broadly prohibits \nStates from \u201cadopt[ing] or attempt[ing] to enforce any \n\n6 \n \nstandard relating to the control of emissions from new \nmotor vehicles.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(a).  This preemption \nprovision prevents \u201can anarchic patchwork of federal \nand state regulatory programs, a prospect which \nthreatened to create nightmares for the manufactur-\ners.\u201d  Motor Equip. Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 627 F.2d 1095, \n1109 (D.C. Cir. 1979).   \nCongress created one exception to Section 209(a)\u2019s \nbroad preemption of state emission standards:  Section \n209(b), which authorizes EPA to \u201cwaive\u201d preemption \nfor certain standards adopted by California.  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7543(b).3  Congress granted California this special \nstatus because of the State\u2019s \u201cunique problems\u201d with \nsmog and other local issues caused by so-called \u201ccrite-\nria\u201d pollutants like particulate matter.  H.R. Rep. No. \n90-728, at 22 (1967).  In particular, California\u2019s atypical \n\u201cgeography and prevailing wind patterns,\u201d together \nwith its unusually large number of vehicles, made smog \na more persistent problem there than elsewhere.   \n49 Fed. Reg. 18,887, 18,890 (May 3, 1984) (citing  \n113 Cong. Rec. 30,948 (Nov. 2, 1967)). \nCongress limited California\u2019s ability to separately \nregulate emissions in several ways.  The onus is first \non California, which must \u201cdetermine[] that the State \nstandards will be, in the aggregate, at least as protec-\ntive of public health and welfare as applicable Federal \nstandards.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(b)(1).  After the State \nmakes that determination and files an application, \nEPA must deny a waiver if it finds that (1) California\u2019s \n \n3 \nSection 209(b) does not name California.  It instead makes a \npreemption waiver possible for \u201cany State\u201d that had adopted certain \nstandards \u201cprior to March 30, 1966.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7543(b)(1).  But as \nCongress was aware, California was the only State that met this cri-\nterion and \u201cis thus the only state eligible for a waiver.\u201d  Motor Equip. \nMfrs. Ass\u2019n, 627 F.2d at 1100 n.1. \n\n7 \n \nprotectiveness determination is \u201carbitrary and capri-\ncious,\u201d id. \u00a7 7543(b)(1)(A); (2) California \u201cdoes not need \nsuch State standards to meet compelling and extraor-\ndinary conditions,\u201d id. \u00a7 7543(b)(1)(B); or (3) the pro-\nposed state standards are inconsistent with federal \nemission standards, id. \u00a7 7543(b)(1)(C). \nIn 1977, ten years after setting up this preemption \nframework, Congress amended the Clean Air Act to al-\nlow other States to follow California.  Any State may \nnow \u201cadopt and enforce\u201d California standards \u201cfor \nwhich a waiver has been granted,\u201d so long as the adopt-\ning State has an approved plan to attain the federal air-\nquality standards for criteria pollutants.  42 U.S.C.  \n\u00a7\u00a7 7507, 7408(a), 7409.  The upshot of this unusual \npreemption system is that EPA sets nationwide emis-\nsion standards; California may in limited circum-\nstances set more stringent ones for itself; and other \nStates may either apply EPA\u2019s standards or adopt Cal-\nifornia\u2019s, but may not set their own. \nB. Regulatory Background \n1. For decades, Section 209(b) worked as Congress \nhad envisioned.  EPA granted California waivers for \nthe State to set emission standards designed to combat \nlocal air-quality problems like smog.  See, e.g., 38 Fed. \nReg. 10,317, 10,318 (Apr. 26, 1973); 59 Fed. Reg. 48,625, \n48,626 (Sept. 22, 1994).  In recent years, however, Cal-\nifornia has sought to transform its unique preemption \nexception into a tool for targeting global climate \nchange.  It has done so through aggressive regulations \nthat limit vehicle greenhouse-gas emissions and force \nelectrification of the State\u2019s (and consequently the Na-\ntion\u2019s) vehicle fleet. \nCalifornia\u2019s efforts initially stalled.  In 2008, under \nPresident George W. Bush, EPA denied California\u2019s \nfirst application for a waiver for climate-change- \n\n8 \n \nfocused regulations.  California sought to impose \nstandards limiting greenhouse-gas emissions from new \nmotor vehicles in the State.  73 Fed. Reg. 12,156, \n12,156-12,157 (Mar. 6, 2008).  EPA rejected California\u2019s \napplication, explaining that Section 209(b)\u2019s preemp-\ntion waiver permitted California to enact standards to \naddress only \u201clocal and regional\u201d pollution where the \n\u201ccausal factors are local to California\u201d\u2014which obvi-\nously did not include global climate change.  Id. at \n12,163. \nThe day after President Obama took office, Califor-\nnia sought reconsideration of EPA\u2019s denial of its waiver \napplication.  EPA granted reconsideration, reversed it-\nself, and issued the waiver.  74 Fed. Reg. 32,744, 32,783 \n(July 8, 2009).  EPA \u201creject[ed]\u201d its prior conclusion \nthat Section 209(b) did not authorize California to \n\u201cpromulgate state standards designed to address \nglobal climate change problems\u201d and approved Califor-\nnia\u2019s first set of greenhouse-gas emission standards.  \nId. at 32,746.  In assessing the \u201cprotectiveness\u201d of Cal-\nifornia\u2019s standards, EPA relied on California\u2019s finding \nthat the standards \u201cwill result in a reduction in up-\nstream emissions (emission due to the production and \ntransportation of the fuel used by the vehicle) of green-\nhouse gas, criteria and toxic pollutants due to reduced \nfuel usage.\u201d  Id. at 32,750 n.36 (emphasis added) (cita-\ntion omitted).   \nA number of affected car dealers challenged EPA\u2019s \nwaiver decision.  Before the D.C. Circuit could rule, \nEPA \u201cpromulgated national greenhouse gas stand-\nards\u201d for model years 2012 through 2016, \u201cand Califor-\nnia amended its regulations to deem compliance with \nthose national standards as compliance with its own.\u201d  \nChamber of Commerce v. EPA, 642 F.3d 192, 206 (D.C. \nCir. 2011).  Pointing to those two developments, the \n\n9 \n \nD.C. Circuit held that the challenge to EPA\u2019s Section \n209(b) waiver was moot.  Ibid.   \n2. This case concerns California\u2019s next greenhouse-\ngas waiver request.  In 2012, California applied for a \nnew waiver to allow it to impose its \u201cAdvanced Clean \nCars\u201d program, which includes stricter standards \naimed at further curbing greenhouse-gas emissions \nfrom vehicles.  The proposed standards govern all new \npassenger cars, light-duty trucks, and medium-duty \npassenger vehicles sold in California for model year \n2015 through at least model year 2025.  California \npraised its Advanced Clean Cars standards as \u201csome of \nthe best tools we have\u201d \u201cto tackle the climate crisis\u201d by \n\u201creduc[ing] emissions\u201d and \u201cdriv[ing] technological in-\nnovation.\u201d  EPA News Release.   \nTwo components of the Advanced Clean Cars pro-\ngram are especially relevant here.  First, the program \nincludes greenhouse-gas emission standards that limit \ncarbon-dioxide emissions across fleets of vehicles.  \nManufacturers meet those limits by producing more \nelectric vehicles or by implementing technologies that \nreduce fuel consumption in combustion-engine vehi-\ncles, such as \u201celectric drive technologies\u201d and \u201cengine \nefficiency improvements.\u201d  78 Fed. Reg. 2,112, 2,136-\n2,137 (Jan. 9, 2013); see Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1961.3.  \nSecond, the program includes a \u201czero-emission vehicle\u201d \nmandate, which requires each car manufacturer to pro-\nduce and deliver for sale in California an increasing \npercentage of battery-electric or fuel-cell vehicles out \nof its overall fleet (or purchase regulatory \u201ccredits\u201d in-\nstead).  Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(b).  This man-\ndate culminates in a requirement that 22% of a manu-\nfacturer\u2019s passenger vehicles produced for model year \n2025, accounting for credits, must be zero-emission  \n\n10 \n \nvehicles\u2014up from 4.5% in model year 2018.4  Id.  \n\u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A).  California explained in its waiver ap-\nplication that the zero-emission-vehicle mandate \u201ccan \ndramatically reduce petroleum consumption . . . com-\npared to conventional technologies.\u201d  J.A. 28 (citation \nomitted). \nIn 2013, EPA granted the waiver, allowing Califor-\nnia \u201cto enforce its [Advanced Clean Cars] emission  \nregulations.\u201d  78 Fed. Reg. at 2,145.  EPA concluded \nthat California\u2019s standards met Section 209(b)\u2019s  \nrequirements\u2014including that they were \u201cneeded to meet \ncompelling and extraordinary conditions\u201d\u2014because \nthe threat of global climate change was itself \u201cextraor-\ndinary.\u201d  Id. at 2,129.  Notably, EPA credited Califor-\nnia\u2019s finding that the cost of its regulations would be \n\u201cmore than offset by consumer fuel savings over the \nlife of the vehicles.\u201d  Id. at 2,138.   \n3. Under the first Trump Administration, EPA re-\nverted to its original approach to Section 209(b).  In a \n2019 joint rulemaking with NHTSA, EPA rescinded the \n2013 preemption waiver for California\u2019s greenhouse-gas \nstandards and zero-emission-vehicle mandate, again \nreasoning that global climate change is not the kind of \n\u201cpeculiar,\u201d California-specific condition covered by \nSection 209(b).  84 Fed. Reg. 51,310, 51,328, 51,342 \n(Sept. 27, 2019).  EPA also found that California did not \n\u201cneed\u201d its standards to \u201cmeet\u201d climate-change condi-\ntions because California\u2019s standards would likely result \n \n4 \nCalifornia\u2019s regulations express this mandate as a \u201ccredit per-\ncentage requirement.\u201d  Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(b)(1).  Be-\ncause electric vehicles with longer ranges can generate more than \none credit, the exact percentage of electric vehicles can vary from \nmanufacturer to manufacturer.  See id. \u00a7 1962.2(d)(5); 78 Fed. Reg. \nat 2,119.  \n\n11 \n \nin \u201cno change in temperatures or physical impacts re-\nsulting from anthropogenic climate change in Califor-\nnia.\u201d  Id. at 51,341. \n4. On his first day in office, President Biden signed \nExecutive Order 13,990, directing EPA to \u201cconsider \nsuspending, revising, or rescinding\u201d the 2019 with-\ndrawal of California\u2019s 2013 waiver.  86 Fed. Reg. 7,037, \n7,037 (Jan. 20, 2021).  EPA dutifully reinstated Califor-\nnia\u2019s waiver, allowing the Advanced Clean Cars pro-\ngram to come back into effect.  Pet. App. 57a. \nIn reinstating the waiver, EPA flipped back to its \n2013 interpretation of Section 209(b).  Pet. App. 155a.  \nUnder that interpretation, California can obtain a \nwaiver so long as it \u201cneeds its program as a whole to \nmeet compelling and extraordinary conditions\u201d\u2014even \nif it does not actually need the specific standards at is-\nsue.  C.A. EPA Br. 84 (emphasis added); see Pet. App. \n158a.  In other words, California can tack on any emis-\nsion standards it likes to its exempt emissions \u201cpro-\ngram,\u201d so long as the State\u2019s local criteria-pollutant \nproblems \u201cpersist.\u201d  C.A. EPA Br. 66.  Applying that \npermissive reading of the statute, EPA concluded that \nthe waiver was justified primarily because California \nneeds its separate vehicle-emission program, as a \nwhole, to address its ongoing problems with criteria \npollutants.  Pet. App. 155a-162a, 186a-188a. \nEPA embraced the significance of its action, herald-\ning the waiver as a \u201ccritical step to confront the climate \ncrisis.\u201d  EPA News Release.  To date, 17 States and the \nDistrict of Columbia have adopted California\u2019s  \ngreenhouse-gas emission standards, its zero-emission-\nvehicle mandate, or both.  California Air Resources \nBoard (CARB), States that Have Adopted California\u2019s \nVehicle Regulations (June 2024), https://perma.cc/ \n\n12 \n \nM6LC-SVR8.  Together with California, those jurisdic-\ntions account for more than 40% of the Nation\u2019s new \nvehicle market.  Pet. App. 179a. \nC. Proceedings Below \n1.  Petitioners are entities (and trade associations \nwhose members include entities) that produce or sell \nliquid fuels\u2014gasoline, diesel, biodiesel, renewable die-\nsel, and ethanol\u2014and the raw materials used to make \nthem.  They promptly challenged EPA\u2019s waiver rein-\nstatement in the D.C. Circuit in May 2022, within 60 \ndays of the agency action.  Pet. App. 15a.   \nAlong with their opening brief in the court of ap-\npeals, petitioners filed 14 standing declarations that \nexplained how reinstating California\u2019s standards would \ndepress demand for liquid fuel, injuring them finan-\ncially in a variety of ways.  J.A. 120-184.  Fuel produc-\ners explained how reducing the demand for their prod-\nucts in California would lead to an unavoidable loss in \nbusiness.  J.A. 133-136.  For example, petitioner Dia-\nmond Alternative Energy explained that it sells renew-\nable diesel, a liquid fuel that can be used interchange-\nably with petroleum-derived diesel; that California \u201cac-\ncounts for almost all of the renewable diesel consumed \nin the United States\u201d; and that the standards would di-\nminish that demand.  J.A. 135. \nOther petitioners similarly established the negative \nimpact of California\u2019s standards on their bottom lines.  \nAn association of convenience stores explained that \nCalifornia\u2019s standards would mean its members\u2019 \u201cfuel-\ning stations sell less fuel\u201d and their convenience stores \nlose revenue because fewer customers \u201ccome through \n[their] stores.\u201d  J.A. 140.  And associations of corn \ngrowers noted that California\u2019s standards would drive \ndown demand for ethanol (which is blended into gaso-\nline), in turn \u201cdecreasing demand for the corn\u201d grown \n\n13 \n \nby their members to produce ethanol.  J.A. 130, 154, \n158, 167.   \nEPA did not contest petitioners\u2019 Article III stand-\ning below.  But California and other state and local gov-\nernment intervenors did.  J.A. 185-187.  They argued \nthat petitioners had not \u201cestablished any probability \nthat manufacturers would change course if EPA\u2019s \n[waiver] decision were vacated\u201d because automakers \nwere planning to increase electric-vehicle production \nfor independent reasons.  J.A. 187.  Their own inter-\nvention motion, however, attached declarations assert-\ning that \u201cadditional gasoline-fueled vehicles would be \nsold during these model years\u201d if EPA\u2019s waiver were \noverturned.  J.A. 115.   \nIn reply, petitioners explained that they had stand-\ning because vacating the waiver would remove a \u201cdirect \nregulatory impediment\u201d to their products\u2019 use.   \nJ.A. 210 (quoting Energy Future Coal., 793 F.3d at \n144).  Petitioners also pointed out that they were enti-\ntled to rely on the \u201creasonably predictable\u201d conduct of \ncar manufacturers.  Ibid.  Petitioners noted that Cali-\nfornia itself had predicted automakers would produce \nmore \u201czero-emission vehicles\u201d in response to its stand-\nards.  Ibid. (quoting C.A. J.A. 237).  And there was am-\nple record evidence that not all manufacturers had \u201cir-\nrevocably committed\u201d to electrification.  Ibid. (citing \nC.A. J.A. 477).  \nAt oral argument in September 2023, counsel for the \nstate and local government intervenors made argu-\nments sounding in mootness, not standing.  In response \nto questioning from the panel, California contended \nthat automakers could no longer change their produc-\ntion and sales plans for vehicles through model year \n2025\u2014the year in which the court apparently assumed \nthe waiver would end.  See C.A. Oral Arg. 1:10:27-\n\n14 \n \n1:10:31 (asserting that petitioners \u201cneed evidence that \nmanufacturers are going to change their product lines \nand sell different vehicles in model year 2025\u201d) (em-\nphasis added).  In reaction to that shifting theory of \njusticiability, petitioners moved to file a supplemental \nbrief and declarations explaining why their petitions \nwere not moot.  Petitioners also explained that the Cal-\nifornia standards covered by EPA\u2019s waiver purported \nto extend beyond model year 2025.  C.A. Pet. Supp. Br. \n5-6; see J.A. 50.  EPA remained conspicuously silent \nabout petitioners\u2019 standing and the temporal scope of \nthe waiver.   \n2. The court of appeals held that petitioners lack \nArticle III standing to challenge EPA\u2019s waiver.  Pet. \nApp. 19a.  Although the court declined to \u201cdefinitively \ndecide\u201d whether petitioners had established injury and \ncausation, it did not question either showing.  Id. at \n21a.   \nInstead, the court of appeals concluded that peti-\ntioners had failed to show that their injuries would be \nredressed if EPA\u2019s decision were set aside.  Pet. App. \n19a.  The court faulted petitioners for \u201cfail[ing] to point \nto any evidence affirmatively demonstrating that vaca-\ntur of the waiver would be substantially likely to\u201d \nprompt automakers to produce fewer electric vehicles \nor alter their prices so that more liquid-fuel-powered \nvehicles would be sold.  Id. at 23a.  It reasoned that \n\u201cunsupported assumptions regarding the future ac-\ntions of third-party market participants are insuffi-\ncient to establish Article III standing.\u201d  Id. at 29a.  The \ncourt also thought that the redressability inquiry was \n\u201ccomplicated by the relatively short duration of the \nwaiver,\u201d id. at 22a, though it disclaimed any finding \nthat the case had been \u201cmooted by the passage of \n\n15 \n \ntime,\u201d id. at 25a.  By hinging its decision on redressa-\nbility, the court effectively held that even if the waiver \nhad been vacated at the moment EPA reinstated it in \n2022, automakers might not have changed any produc-\ntion plans or prices before the end of model year 2025.  \nId. at 22a-24a.  The waiver was pointless the instant it \nwas reinstated. \nThe court of appeals declined to consider petition-\ners\u2019 supplemental brief and declarations.  Pet. App. \n30a.  The court reasoned that there was no \u201cgood \ncause\u201d to supplement the record.  Id. at 31a. \nD. Subsequent Developments \n1. Petitioners sought review in this Court.  In re-\nsponse, EPA explained that while the court of appeals \nhad based its redressability holding on the \u201crelatively \nshort duration of the waiver,\u201d Pet. App. 22a, in EPA\u2019s \nview the waiver does not actually sunset.  EPA Br. in \nOpp. 12-13.  According to EPA, California\u2019s greenhouse-\ngas standards continue to \u201cremain in force\u201d after model \nyear 2025, and \u201cthe waiver likewise does not terminate \nwith model-year 2025.\u201d  Id. at 13.   \nShortly thereafter, EPA took the same position in a \ndifferent regulatory action.  In proposing to approve \nCalifornia\u2019s request to include the Advanced Clean \nCars greenhouse-gas emission standards in the State\u2019s \nupdated state implementation plan, EPA credited Cal-\nifornia\u2019s July 2021 projections that those standards will \nreduce fuel consumption, and thus reduce nitrogen- \noxide and particulate-matter emissions, through at \nleast 2037.  89 Fed. Reg. 82,553, 82,557, 82,558 (Oct. 11, \n2024); see C.A. Reply 4 (citing California\u2019s projections); \nJ.A. 93-94. \n2. On December 17, 2024, EPA granted two new \nSection 209(b) preemption waivers for California, in-\ncluding for the \u201cAdvanced Clean Cars II\u201d program.  \n\n16 \n \nSee 90 Fed. Reg. 642, 642 (Jan. 6, 2025).  That program \n\u201cwill require all new passenger cars and light-duty \ntrucks delivered for sale in California to be zero- \nemission\u201d by 2035.

They have Article III standing to chal-\nlenge an EPA waiver allowing California to enforce  \nvehicle-emission standards designed to reduce the con-\nsumption of liquid fuel.  The court of appeals was wrong \nto conclude otherwise. \nI. Although the court of appeals did not consider \nthe first two prongs of Article III\u2019s standing require-\nments, petitioners easily established that they have \n \n5 \nAt least some of petitioners plan to challenge EPA\u2019s recent \ndecision to grant that waiver, and one challenge has already been \nfiled.  American Free Enter. Chamber of Com. v. EPA, No. 25-106 \n(9th Cir.).  \n\n17 \n \nsuffered a concrete injury-in-fact fairly traceable to \nEPA\u2019s waiver.  \nA. EPA\u2019s preemption waiver for California\u2019s Ad-\nvanced Clean Cars program hits petitioners with a \nclassic pocketbook injury.  Petitioners produce liquid \nfuel and its component parts, so any reduction in de-\nmand for their products brings down their bottom \nlines.  Petitioners attested to their injuries in their \nmany standing declarations submitted to the court of \nappeals, in which they explained the details of their \nbusinesses and how reduced demand for liquid fuels \nlowers their revenues. \nB. EPA\u2019s waiver causes petitioners\u2019 injuries.  The \nwaiver allows California to enforce its zero-emission-\nvehicle mandate and its greenhouse-gas emission \nstandards\u2014both of which mandate the production of \nvehicles that use less or no liquid fuel.  California\u2019s \nstandards push the car market beyond what consumers \nwould ordinarily demand and automakers would ordi-\nnarily produce and sell; that is the point of the stand-\nards.  There is thus a clear causal connection between \nCalifornia\u2019s market intervention and petitioners\u2019  \nmarket-based injuries.  \nII.  Petitioners\u2019 injuries are redressable for three \nreasons.   \nA. Most simply, a decision vacating EPA\u2019s waiver \nwould remove a regulatory impediment to the use of \npetitioners\u2019 products.  As this Court has found in a va-\nriety of circumstances, the removal of the coercive ef-\nfect of government action on third parties alone suf-\nfices to establish redressability.  Challengers do not \nneed to supply additional record evidence of third par-\nties\u2019 likely reactions.  That is because such challengers \n(or their products) are being denied an opportunity to \n\n18 \n \ncompete in the marketplace, which vacating the gov-\nernment action will redress.  Redressability, after all, \nfocuses on the match between the judicial relief re-\nquested and the injury suffered\u2014and when challeng-\ners seek to vacate a rule targeting their products, the \nmatch is perfect.   \nB. Even if this Court declines to adopt that categor-\nical rule, petitioners can at least establish redressabil-\nity by relying on the predictable effects of the chal-\nlenged government action on third parties.  This Court \nhas time and again distinguished between speculative \nand predictable third-party responses to a judicial de-\ncision.  When a third-party response is speculative, rec-\nord evidence may be required to establish redressabil-\nity.  But when a third-party response is predictable, no \nmore is needed than a dose of common sense.   \nIt is not just predictable but obvious that allowing \nCalifornia to limit vehicles\u2019 emissions will result in less \nfuel consumption.  California\u2019s standards require that \nautomakers produce and sell more fuel-efficient cars \nand fewer cars that run on liquid fuel.  If EPA\u2019s waiver \nis set aside and California\u2019s standards are preempted, \nat least one automaker will choose to sell more vehicles \nwith lower fuel efficiency or more combustion-engine \nvehicles.  It is difficult to imagine that the parties and \ntheir many amici would have litigated this case for \nnearly three years and counting if that were not true.   \nC.  The court of appeals rejected these two straight-\nforward theories of redressability.  Instead, it imposed \nextraordinary burdens on entities indirectly affected \nby agency action, effectively requiring evidence from \nthe directly regulated entities themselves.  The court \nalso raised timing concerns that conflated redressabil-\nity and mootness, with significant consequences.  Its \nmisplaced redressability label flipped the burden of \n\n19 \n \nproof from the government to petitioners, while leaving \npetitioners without recourse to established mootness \nexceptions.   \nIf left uncorrected, the decision below would have \npractical repercussions as serious as its doctrinal er-\nrors.  A heightened redressability requirement would \nlock the courthouse doors to numerous traditional chal-\nlengers to agency action, so long as the targets of reg-\nulation have different interests than directly regulated \nparties (as is often the case).  It would also encourage \nagencies to intentionally act on shorter time horizons \nto shield their actions from review, and it would cut off \nreview of the most politically sensitive actions.  \nD.  At a minimum, petitioners\u2019 injuries are redress-\nable even under the court of appeals\u2019 mistaken reason-\ning, because EPA has now conceded that its waiver for \ncertain California standards does not sunset.  The \ncourt of appeals was concerned about what it viewed as \nthe relatively short four-year duration of the waiver.  \nBut as EPA has since explained to this Court, its \nwaiver does not expire unless California changes its \nstandards, and California has never amended its \ngreenhouse-gas standards.  Put differently, the \nwaiver\u2019s effects do not expire after model year 2025.  \nThere thus can be no plausible dispute that vacating \nthe waiver will have some effect on automaker behavior \nat some point in the future.  Standards that regulate \nmarket allocation forever are all but guaranteed to \nhave at least one dollar of economic impact. \nARGUMENT \nTo demonstrate Article III standing, a plaintiff \nmust show that he suffered a concrete injury, that the \ninjury is fairly traceable to the challenged action, and \nthat the \u201cinjury will be redressed by a favorable deci-\nsion.\u201d  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 \n\n20 \n \n(1992) (citation omitted).  Taken collectively, these re-\nquirements ensure that federal courts decide only \u201cthe \nrights of individuals,\u201d and maintain \u201ctheir proper  \nfunction in a limited and separated government.\u201d  \nTransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413, 423 (2021) \n(citations omitted). \nWhen a plaintiff is directly regulated by a chal-\nlenged agency action, \u201cthere is ordinarily little ques-\ntion\u201d that he has standing to challenge the action.  \nLujan, 504 U.S. at 561.  By contrast, when a \u201cplaintiff \nis not himself the object of the government action or \ninaction he challenges, standing is . . . ordinarily \u2018sub-\nstantially more difficult\u2019 to establish.\u201d  Id. at 562 (cita-\ntion omitted).  Nevertheless, \u201centire classes of admin-\nistrative litigation\u201d have \u201ctraditionally been brought \nby unregulated\u201d but \u201cadversely affected parties.\u201d  Cor-\nner Post, Inc. v. Board of Governors of the Fed. Rsrv. \nSys., 603 U.S. 799, 827, 833 (2024) (Kavanaugh, J., con-\ncurring); see id. at 833-837 (collecting cases).  Those \nchallenges make particular sense where government \nregulations target someone \u201cdownstream or upstream\u201d \nfrom the entities that the regulations directly govern.  \nAlliance for Hippocratic Medicine, 602 U.S. at 384. \nPetitioners here are not directly regulated, but they \nare the prime targets of government regulation.  They \neasily satisfy the three components of Article III \nstanding.  Petitioners produce, refine, or sell liquid \nfuels and the raw materials used to produce them.  \nThey promptly challenged EPA\u2019s waiver, which allows \nCalifornia to impose otherwise-preempted standards \nthat are designed to reduce the use of liquid fuel\u2014 \nhitting petitioners with a classic pocketbook injury.  \nSetting aside EPA\u2019s waiver would mean that California \n\n21 \n \ncannot enforce its standards, ending the artificial de-\npression of demand for petitioners\u2019 products.  This case \nshould be no more complicated than that. \nI. PETITIONERS SUFFERED AN INJURY-IN-\nFACT CAUSED BY EPA\u2019S ACTION \n \nThe court of appeals skipped the injury and causa-\ntion prongs of standing, resting its holding entirely on \nredressability grounds.  That may be because petition-\ners easily satisfy the first two prongs of the Article III \nstanding analysis.  Petitioners suffered concrete and \nparticularized injuries, and those injuries are fairly \ntraceable to EPA\u2019s waiver decision. \nA. Petitioners \nSuffered \nClassic \nPocketbook  \nInjuries \n \nPetitioners include businesses at every stage of the \nsupply chain for liquid fuels.  They grow the raw mate-\nrials for liquid fuel, produce and refine liquid fuel, and \nsell liquid fuel at gas stations and convenience stores.  \nSee, e.g., J.A. 127-128 (producers of corn to make etha-\nnol), 131-132 (producers and sellers of renewable liquid \nfuels), 138-139 (owners of gas stations and convenience \nstores).  Petitioners differ in the exact nature of their \nbusinesses, but they all have one thing in common:  they \nprofit from participating in the liquid-fuels market. \nBy design, California\u2019s standards operate to reduce \nthe liquid-fuels market and thus injure those who par-\nticipate in it.  That is because the Advanced Clean Cars \nstandards aim to reduce emissions by reducing liquid \nfuel combustion in vehicles.  To comply, manufacturers \nmust produce more electric vehicles, subsidize the pro-\nduction of electric vehicles, implement technologies \nthat improve the fuel efficiency of vehicles, or some \ncombination thereof.  See J.A. 8-9 (identifying possible \ncompliance technologies); 78 Fed. Reg. at 2,136-2,137 \n\n22 \n \n(same).  The standards thus force automakers to pro-\nduce a fleet of vehicles that use significantly less liquid \nfuel or no liquid fuel at all.  In fact, California repeat-\nedly represented as much when applying for the chal-\nlenged waiver.  J.A. 35, 49.  Fewer cars that run on liq-\nuid fuel, or more cars that run on less liquid fuel, means \nless liquid fuel sold.  And suppressing demand for a \nparty\u2019s product is the prototypical monetary injury-in-\nfact.  See TransUnion, 594 U.S. at 425; United States \nv. Texas, 599 U.S. 670, 676 (2023).   \nPetitioners explained these prototypical pocketbook \ninjuries in the 14 standing declarations they submitted \nwith their opening brief below.  Those declarations de-\ntail how petitioners participate in the liquid-fuel supply \nchain and how the reduction in demand caused by Cal-\nifornia\u2019s standards would financially injure their busi-\nnesses.  See J.A. 120-184.  For example, producers ex-\nplained that a \u201csignificant reduction in California\u2019s gas-\noline demand, as contemplated by the [Advanced Clean \nCars] I program, will detrimentally impact Valero\u2019s \nbusiness.\u201d  J.A. 147.  And they confirmed their inability \nto \u201cavoid financial harm\u201d by shifting production out-\nside of California or by repurposing their products.  \nJ.A. 170; see J.A. 144-145, 147-150.  As these declara-\ntions underscore, petitioners have a concrete stake in \nthe outcome:  their businesses are on the line.  \u201cThis is \na classic pocketbook injury sufficient to give [them] \nstanding.\u201d  Tyler v. Hennepin Cnty., 598 U.S. 631, 636 \n(2023).   \nB. Petitioners\u2019 Injuries Are Fairly Traceable To \nEPA\u2019s Waiver \nPetitioners likewise satisfy Article III\u2019s causation \nrequirement.  To demonstrate causation, a party must \nestablish a \u201ccausal connection between the injury and \nthe conduct complained of.\u201d  Susan B. Anthony List v. \n\n23 \n \nDriehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 158 (2014) (citation omitted).  \nThat \u201crequires only that the plaintiff\u2019s injury be fairly \ntraceable to the defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d  Lexmark Int\u2019l, \nInc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, \n134 n.6 (2014).  The connection between petitioners\u2019 in-\njuries and EPA\u2019s waiver is straightforward here.  The \nwaiver allows California\u2019s greenhouse-gas emission \nstandards and zero-emission-vehicle mandate to take \neffect, when federal law would otherwise preempt \nthem.  Pet. App. 55a-57a.  Those portions of the Ad-\nvanced Clean Cars program operate by requiring in-\ncreased fuel economy or full electrification, thereby de-\npressing demand for petitioners\u2019 products.   \nPetitioners\u2019 injuries are attributable to government \nregulation, not solely to existing consumer demand for \nelectric vehicles.  The entire purpose of California\u2019s \nstandards is to go beyond what market forces would \nnaturally produce.  That is why California described its \nregulations as \u201ccritical\u201d for \u201cemissions reductions\u201d and \n\u201ccritical for incentivizing production and deployment of \nzero-emission vehicles.\u201d  J.A. 66.  Those standards in-\nclude a 22% zero-emission-vehicle mandate, far above \nwhat the market had naturally produced.  Cal. Code \nRegs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(b)(1); see David Gohlke et al., As-\nsessment of Light-Duty Plug-in Electric Vehicles in \nthe United States, 2010\u20132021, at 1 (Nov. 1, 2022), \nhttps://perma.cc/Y6VE-2QB5.  Because California\u2019s \nstandards aim to reduce liquid-fuel use by increasing \nthe number of electric or fuel-efficient vehicles beyond \nmarket demand, petitioners have \u201clink[ed] their as-\nserted injuries to the government\u2019s regulation . . . of \nsomeone else.\u201d  Alliance for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. \nat 382. \n\n24 \n \nII. PETITIONERS\u2019 INJURIES ARE REDRESSABLE \nBecause petitioners suffered classic pocketbook in-\njuries caused by a federal regulatory action, and be-\ncause they challenged that action almost immediately, \nit would be unusual if petitioners\u2019 injuries were not re-\ndressable.  Redressability requires only that a favora-\nble judicial judgment would \u201ctake steps to slow or re-\nduce\u201d the plaintiff\u2019s injury.  Massachusetts v. EPA, \n549 U.S. 497, 525 (2007).  Thus, when a plaintiff asserts \nan economic injury, she establishes redressability if a \nfavorable decision would put even one dollar back in \nher pocket.  Uzuegbunam v. Preczewski, 592 U.S. 279, \n291 (2021).  That is no high bar.   \nThe bar is easily cleared here.  Most simply, the \nchallenged government action creates a legal hurdle to \nthe use of petitioners\u2019 products, so setting aside that \ngovernment action would provide redress.  And were \nthat not enough, petitioners can always rely on the \n\u201cpredictable effect\u201d of regulation on third parties to es-\ntablish redressability.  Department of Commerce,  \n588 U.S. at 768.  It is certainly predictable that an  \nelectric-vehicle mandate will result in fewer liquid-\nfuel-powered vehicles on the roads; that is the man-\ndate\u2019s raison d\u2019\u00eatre.  At a minimum, the decision below \nmust be vacated because it was premised on a factual \nmistake.  EPA has since confirmed that the waiver al-\nlowing California to target petitioners\u2019 products has no \ndefinite end date.  An agency action limiting the use of \npetitioners\u2019 products in perpetuity must have some \nreal-world effect. \n\n25 \n \nA. Petitioners Have Established Redressability \nBecause They Are Challenging A Regulatory \nHurdle To The Use Of Their Products \nCalifornia\u2019s Advanced Clean Cars standards re-\nquire car manufacturers to produce an increasing per-\ncentage of vehicles that consume less liquid fuel or no \nliquid fuel at all.  Because the standards impose a new \nlegal barrier to the use of petitioners\u2019 products\u2014and \nindeed reducing consumption of petitioners\u2019 products \nis how the standards achieve their intended purpose\u2014 \nvacating EPA\u2019s waiver would provide petitioners with \nredress.  Article III requires nothing more. \n1. Removing \nthe \ncoercive \neffect \nof  \ngovernment standards provides redress \na.  This Court has long recognized that removing the \n\u201cdeterminative or coercive effect\u201d of government reg-\nulation \u201cupon the action of someone else\u201d is sufficient \nto establish redressability.  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 169.  \nThus, if a plaintiff can establish the existence of a reg-\nulatory impediment that prevents its product from be-\ning used, that is enough. \nIn Bennett, this Court made clear that the removal \nof an adverse agency action\u2014even one that operates on \na third party\u2014provides redress to individuals injured \nby that action.  There, a group of ranchers challenged \na biological opinion issued by the U.S. Fish and Wild-\nlife Service, which advised the Bureau of Reclamation \nto maintain minimum water levels at several reservoirs \nthat the ranchers used.  520 U.S. at 159-160.  The gov-\nernment argued that Article III\u2019s causation and re-\ndressability requirements were not met because it was \npossible that the Bureau would independently opt to \nreduce the ranchers\u2019 access to water, even without the \nchallenged biological opinion.  Id. at 168.  This Court \nunanimously disagreed, recognizing that the biological \n\n26 \n \nopinion had a \u201cvirtually determinative effect\u201d on the \nBureau\u2019s decisions because disregarding it could ex-\npose the Bureau and its employees to liability under \nthe Endangered Species Act.  Id. at 170.  The removal \nof the \u201ccoercive\u201d force of the biological opinion on the \nBureau alone established redressability.  Id. at 171.  \nThe ranchers did not need to provide additional evi-\ndence to show that their injury was \u201cfairly traceable\u201d \nto the opinion or that it would \u201clikely be redressed\u201d if \nthe opinion were withdrawn.  Id. at 169-171. \nBennett made explicit what had been assumed in a \nlong line of this Court\u2019s cases resolving challenges to \ngovernment action brought by indirectly regulated \nparties.  For example, this Court heard a suit by pri-\nvate schools challenging as unconstitutional an Oregon \nlaw making it a crime for parents to send their children \nto private school.  Pierce v. Society of the Sisters of the \nHoly Names of Jesus and Mary, 268 U.S. 510, 534 \n(1925).  Although the parents were directly regulated, \nthe private schools were the target\u2014and there was no \ndoubt that they could bring the lawsuit.  The Court did \nnot require the schools to provide evidence that par-\nents would send their children to those schools absent \nOregon\u2019s \u201cunwarranted compulsion.\u201d  Id. at 535.  Simi-\nlarly, in CBS v. United States, this Court found that the \ntelevision network CBS could sue to challenge regula-\ntions denying a license to any broadcasting station that \nconducted certain business with CBS.  316 U.S. 407, \n421-423 (1942).  The Court did not call for evidence that \nlicensees would change course and partner with CBS if \nthe regulations were rescinded; it was enough that po-\ntential licensees intended to comply with the regula-\ntions.  Id. at 422.  \nb. The rule that removal of the \u201cunwarranted com-\npulsion\u201d of government action satisfies redressability \n\n27 \n \ncomports with the original purpose of the redressabil-\nity requirement.  As this Court has repeatedly ex-\nplained, redressability ensures that there is a \u201crela-\ntionship between \u2018the judicial relief requested\u2019 and the \n\u2018injury\u2019 suffered.\u201d  California v. Texas, 593 U.S. 659, \n660 (2021) (quoting Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 753 \nn.19 (1984)).  It thus prevents litigants from suing par-\nties or challenging laws that have \u201cnothing to do with\u201d \ntheir injuries, or requesting overly broad relief.  Id. at \n675; see Haaland v. Brackeen, 599 U.S. 255, 293 (2023) \n(redressability not established because \u201cstate officials \nwho implement [the challenged statute] are not parties \nto the suit\u201d).  And it similarly prevents courts from is-\nsuing \u201cadvisory opinion[s]\u201d that amount to nothing \nmore than \u201ca general authority to conduct oversight,\u201d \nparticularly \u201cof decisions of the elected branches of \nGovernment.\u201d  California, 593 U.S. at 673; see Brack-\neen, 599 U.S. at 294.   \nWhen a plaintiff asks a court to remove a coercive \ngovernment regulation, there is no mismatch between \ninjury and remedy.  Indeed, there is a perfect correla-\ntion between the individual\u2019s injury (which flows from \na constraint that may artificially depress market de-\nmand) and the remedy for that injury (removing the \ngovernment constraint).  And to the extent there are \ndistinct concerns about attenuation, those concerns are \nhoused in other doctrines, such as proximate-cause lim-\nitations that exclude plaintiffs whose injuries are \u201ctoo \nremote\u201d from the conduct a statute prohibits.  See, e.g., \nLexmark, 572 U.S. at 133.  As far as redressability is \nconcerned, however, Article III\u2019s demands are the \nsame whether the plaintiff is directly or indirectly reg-\nulated.   \nc. This Court should confirm the simple, clear rule \nthat the removal of a regulatory hurdle to the use of a \n\n28 \n \nchallenger\u2019s product satisfies Article III\u2019s redressabil-\nity requirement\u2014no matter whether the regulation is \nformally applied to a third party.  That rule has the \nbenefit of comporting not just with traditional under-\nstandings of redressability but also with basic logic.  As \nthen-Judge Kavanaugh put it, if \u201cthe Government pro-\nhibits or impedes Company A from using Company B\u2019s \nproduct,\u201d there is \u201cordinarily little question\u201d that Com-\npany B has standing, since Company B\u2019s product is the \nvery \u201cobject\u201d of the regulation.  Energy Future Coal., \n793 F.3d at 144.  Company B is being deprived of the \n\u201copportunity to compete in the marketplace,\u201d so a fa-\nvorable judicial decision will provide at least some re-\ndress.  Ibid.  Or as this Court has succinctly recognized, \nif a regulatory program causes an injury in fact, \u201c[i]t \nfollows\u201d that \u201ca judicial decree directing [the govern-\nment] to discontinue its program would \u2018redress\u2019 the \ninjury.\u201d  Northeastern Fla. Chapter of Associated Gen. \nConts. of Am. v. City of Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656, 666 \nn.5 (1993).  \n2. California\u2019s standards impose a new  \nregulatory hurdle to the use of petitioners\u2019 \nproducts  \nThe above rule\u2014that removal of a regulatory hurdle \nto the use of a challenger\u2019s product satisfies Article III\u2019s \nredressability requirement\u2014resolves this case.  Peti-\ntioners\u2019 injuries arise from the \u201cdeterminative or coer-\ncive effect\u201d of California\u2019s standards (allowed to go into \neffect by EPA) on third-party automakers.  Bennett, \n520 U.S. at 169.  Although California\u2019s standards do not \ndirectly impose obligations on petitioners, the stand-\nards require somebody else to make vehicles that use \nless of petitioners\u2019 products.  It should be irrelevant \nthat the requirement technically operates on automak-\ners; the government is simply reducing the use of liquid \n\n29 \n \nfuel by regulating the assembly line rather than the gas \npump.   \nAgain, the Advanced Clean Cars program includes \ntwo mechanisms that directly prevent market partici-\npants from consuming as much of petitioners\u2019 products \nas they otherwise might.  First, California\u2019s zero- \nemission-vehicle mandate requires automakers to pro-\nduce an increasing percentage of vehicles that consume \nno liquid fuel.  Second, California\u2019s greenhouse-gas \nemission standards require automakers to produce ve-\nhicles with increased fuel efficiency\u2014with a corre-\nsponding reduction in the use of liquid fuel.  Under ei-\nther mechanism, California\u2019s standards pose a legal \nbarrier to the use of petitioners\u2019 products.  In fact, Cal-\nifornia predicted that \u201c[t]he oil and gas industry, fuel \nproviders, and service stations are likely to be the most \nadversely affected by the proposed Advanced Clean \nCars program due to the substantial reductions in de-\nmand for gasoline.\u201d  J.A. 13.  Petitioners are therefore \nbeing denied the \u201copportunity to compete in the mar-\nketplace\u201d without California\u2019s interference.  Energy \nFuture Coal., 793 F.3d at 144.  Under this Court\u2019s cases \nand a traditional understanding of redressability, no \nmore record evidence is needed. \nB. Petitioners Have Established Redressability  \nBecause They Can Rely On The Predictable  \nEffect Of Emission Standards  \nEven if this Court does not apply a categorical rule \nbased on the removal of a regulatory hurdle to petition-\ners\u2019 products, petitioners can still establish redressa-\nbility through case-specific inferences about third-\nparty conduct.  Article III does not demand certainty; \nit requires that the requested remedy will likely re-\ndress petitioners\u2019 injuries.  That standard is satisfied \n\n30 \n \nhere, where the behavior of third parties is predictable \nrather than speculative. \n1. Litigants can rely on common sense  \nand basic economics to demonstrate  \nredressability \nIndirectly regulated parties have traditionally sat-\nisfied Article III\u2019s redressability requirement so long \nas the conduct of directly regulated parties is reasona-\nbly predictable.  If it is, then a favorable judicial deci-\nsion would \u201clikely\u201d redress injuries inflicted as a result \nof that third party\u2019s action\u2014which is what Article III \nrequires.  Davis v. Federal Election Comm\u2019n, 554 U.S. \n724, 733 (2008).  A contrary rule would shield from ju-\ndicial scrutiny many government actions aimed at indi-\nrectly regulated, but undeniably injured, parties. \na. When a plaintiff\u2019s injury arises from \u201cthe unfet-\ntered choices made by independent actors,\u201d a plaintiff \nmust show that the third party will behave in such a \nway as to \u201cpermit redressability of injury.\u201d  Lujan, \n504 U.S. at 562 (citation omitted).  In applying that \nrule, this Court has repeatedly distinguished between \nreliance on speculative third-party actions and reliance \non predictable third-party behavior.  Record evidence \nis required to bolster the former but not the latter. \nWhen third-party behavior is predictable, com-\nmonsense inferences can suffice.  This Court held as \nmuch in Department of Commerce, 588 U.S. 752.  \nThere, the Court concluded that a group of States with \na disproportionate share of noncitizens had standing to \nchallenge the inclusion of a citizenship question in the \ncensus.  Id. at 767.  Although the States\u2019 harm \u201cde-\npend[ed] on the independent action of third parties\u201d\u2014\nthe noncitizens living in those States\u2014it was \u201cpredict-\nable\u201d that noncitizens would be \u201creluctan[t] to answer \n\n31 \n \na citizenship question\u201d and thus potentially not re-\nspond at all.  Id. at 767-768.  The depressed population \ncount, in turn, could result in a diversion of resources \nfrom the State challengers.  Id. at 767.  The Court ac-\ncepted that predictable chain of events based on com-\nmon sense and historical practice.  Id. at 768.  It did not \nrequire the challengers to gather, for example, affida-\nvits from noncitizens asserting that they would not re-\nspond to a census with a citizenship question. \nAlthough Department of Commerce focused on cau-\nsation, its reasoning applies equally to Article III\u2019s re-\ndressability requirement.  After all, \u201ccausation and re-\ndressability . . . are often \u2018flip sides of the same coin.\u2019  \u201d  \nAlliance for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 380 (quot-\ning Sprint Commc\u2019ns Co. v. APCC Servs., Inc.,  \n554 U.S. 269, 288 (2008)).  For that reason, lower courts \nhave found Article III\u2019s redressability requirement \nsatisfied based on the predictable response of a third \nparty to a judicial decision in the plaintiff\u2019s favor.  See, \ne.g., Skyline Wesleyan Church v. California Dep\u2019t of \nManaged Health Care, 968 F.3d 738, 749-750 (9th Cir. \n2020). \nIndeed, this Court applied similar reasoning in \nMassachusetts v. EPA, when it determined that Mas-\nsachusetts satisfied Article III\u2019s redressability re-\nquirement by looking to the predictable effect on global \nclimate change of requiring EPA to regulate  \ngreenhouse-gas emissions.  549 U.S. at 525-526.  In \nfinding redressability, the Court attached \u201cconsidera-\nble significance\u201d to EPA\u2019s own statements about its \nregulatory priorities, which suggested that ordering \nEPA to set emission standards would cause fewer ve-\nhicle emissions and therefore redress petitioners\u2019 inju-\nries.  Id. at 526.  That is, the Court found that an effect \n\n32 \n \nis predictable, and sufficient to establish redressabil-\nity, when the agency itself presupposes that effect. \nb. By contrast, redressability cannot rest on mere \nspeculation.  This Court has articulated three circum-\nstances where relief is too speculative to satisfy the de-\nmands of Article III.  None is applicable here. \nFirst, when a plaintiff\u2019s causation or redressability \ntheory relies on \u201ccounterintuitive\u201d assumptions about \nthird-party behavior, the plaintiff may need to support \nthat theory with \u201cstronger evidence.\u201d  California, \n593 U.S. at 678.  That was true in California, where the \nState challengers failed to establish redressability be-\ncause they sought to attack a government healthcare \nmandate that lacked any enforcement mechanism.  The \nCourt found it \u201ccounterintuitive\u201d \u201cthat an unenforcea-\nble mandate will cause [the States\u2019] residents to enroll \nin valuable benefits programs that they would other-\nwise forgo,\u201d so the Court required \u201cstronger evidence\u201d \nthat the mandate would actually have such an effect.  \nIbid. \nSecond, redressability may also be too speculative if \na plaintiff relies on a chain of events with thin links be-\ntween them.  For example, in Alliance for Hippocratic \nMedicine, the plaintiffs relied on overly \u201ccomplicated \ncausation theories\u201d to establish their standing to sue.  \n602 U.S. at 386.  The plaintiff doctors claimed that they \nsuffered increased costs or potential liability as a result \nof the FDA\u2019s decisions to relax mifepristone regula-\ntions.  Id. at 387.  But the doctors would first have to \nexperience \u201can increase in the number of pregnant \nwomen seeking treatment\u201d for mifepristone complica-\ntions, and then those treatments would have to result \nin the doctors\u2019 being \u201csued or required to pay higher \ninsurance costs.\u201d  Id. at 391-392.  More \u201cevidence\u201d was \n\n33 \n \nneeded to prove that this chain of events was likely to \noccur.  Id. at 391.  \nThird, if the legal impact of a judicial decision is un-\nclear, redressability may be too speculative.  That was \ntrue in Brackeen, where the challenged statute was en-\nforced by non-party state officials, not the federal de-\nfendants.  As a result, this Court\u2019s opinion could at best \nserve \nas \na \n\u201cpersuasive . . . advisory \nopinion[].\u201d  \n599 U.S. at 294 (citations omitted).  A similar problem \nexisted in United States v. Texas, where the challenged \nguidelines \u201cmerely advise[d] federal officials about \nhow to exercise their prosecutorial discretion when it \ncomes to deciding which aliens to prioritize for arrest \nand removal.\u201d  599 U.S. at 691 (Gorsuch, J., concurring \nin the judgment).  And in Murthy v. Missouri, the gov-\nernment action had concluded by the time the suit was \nbrought, so a judicial decision also served a purely ad-\nvisory function.  603 U.S. 43, 72-73 (2024).  In all those \ncases, additional evidence was required to establish re-\ndressability not because the federal government was \nregulating a third party but because it was not actively \nregulating at all. \nc. The distinction between predictable effects \n(which do not require record evidence) and counterin-\ntuitive or unlikely effects (which do) is especially im-\nportant for lawsuits brought by indirectly regulated \nparties. \nThe Court reinforced this point just last Term in Al-\nliance for Hippocratic Medicine.  Even as it disap-\nproved the particular plaintiffs\u2019 standing theories, the \nCourt acknowledged \u201ca variety of familiar circum-\nstances where government regulation of a third-party \nindividual or business may be likely to cause injury in \nfact to an unregulated plaintiff.\u201d  602 U.S. at 384.  For \nexample, it is predictable that government regulation \n\n34 \n \nof one business \u201cmay cause downstream or upstream \neconomic injuries to others in the chain.\u201d  Ibid. (citing \nNational Credit Union Admin. v. First Nat\u2019l Bank & \nTrust Co., 522 U.S. 479, 488 n.4 (1998); General Motors \nCorp. v. Tracy, 519 U.S. 278, 286-287 (1997); Barlow  \nv. Collins, 397 U.S. 159, 162-164 (1970); and Associa-\ntion of Data Processing Serv. Orgs., Inc. v. Camp, 397 \nU.S. 150, 152 (1970)).  And it is predictable that when \nthe government \u201cregulates parks, national forests, or \nbodies of water,\u201d it will affect the users of those natural \nresources.  Id. at 385 (citing Summers v. Earth Island \nInst., 555 U.S. 488, 494 (2009)).  \u201cThe list goes on.\u201d  \nIbid. (citing Department of Commerce, 588 U.S. at 766-\n768).  In all such cases, plaintiffs rely on \u201ca predictable \nchain of events leading from the government action to \nthe asserted injury.\u201d  Ibid. \n2. Automakers would predictably adjust \ntheir fleets if EPA\u2019s waiver were vacated  \nThe effect of EPA\u2019s waiver on automakers is more \nthan predictable; it is obvious.  EPA\u2019s waiver puts in \nplace California\u2019s Advanced Clean Cars standards.  \nThose standards are specifically designed to reduce the \nnumber of conventional, liquid-fuel-powered vehicles \nthat would otherwise be produced.  J.A. 110, 115-116.  \nAnd no one has disputed that automakers have histor-\nically responded to California\u2019s greenhouse-gas emis-\nsion and zero-emission-vehicle standards by selling \nfewer conventional vehicles.  See 78 Fed. Reg. at 2,141-\n2,142.  After all, if that were not the historical response, \nCalifornia \u201cwould presumably not bother with such ef-\nforts.\u201d  Massachusetts, 549 U.S. at 526 (citation omit-\nted).   \nIn continuing to defend its standards, California has \nconfirmed that it is intentionally trying to reduce de-\n\n35 \n \nmand for petitioners\u2019 products.  California has repeat-\nedly told EPA that the State wants its greenhouse-gas \nemission standards to reduce the emissions that come \nfrom burning liquid fuel.  It has explained that its \nstandards increase the number of electric vehicles in \nuse, thereby avoiding the \u201cproduction and delivery of \ngasoline.\u201d  J.A. 84.  And California represented to EPA \nthat the standards were \u201ccritical not just for immediate \nemissions reductions but also\u201d for \u201cgreater emission \nreductions in the future.\u201d  J.A. 66.  If regulations are \n\u201ccritical\u201d in the government\u2019s telling, surely litigants \ncan reasonably predict that they will have some effect. \nThe bottom line here is unavoidable.  If EPA\u2019s \nwaiver is vacated, California can no longer force au-\ntomakers to make more electric vehicles or higher- \nefficiency vehicles than they would otherwise produce \nin response to market forces.  Free of government in-\nterference, automakers will respond to market de-\nmand, including by making more vehicles that run on \nmore liquid fuel or by adjusting their distribution plans \nor prices in ways that will result in more liquid-fuel-\npowered vehicle sales.  That theory of automaker be-\nhavior is far from speculative.  It is Economics 101. \nC. The \nCourt \nOf \nAppeals\u2019 \nRedressability  \nAnalysis Is Wrong \nUnder the principles discussed above, the redressa-\nbility inquiry should have been straightforward in this \ncase.  Vacating EPA\u2019s waiver would remove a legal ob-\nstacle to the use of petitioners\u2019 products, and au-\ntomaker behavior is predictable in any event.  Yet the \ncourt of appeals blinded itself to the obvious.  It con-\ncluded that petitioners do not have Article III standing \nby creating artificially high evidentiary barriers to es-\ntablishing redressability.  In so doing, the court made \n\n36 \n \nit nearly impossible for many parties indirectly af-\nfected by government action to secure judicial relief, \nand created incentives for government gamesmanship. \n1. The decision below contradicts this \nCourt\u2019s precedents and common sense  \na. The court of appeals overstated petitioners\u2019 bur-\nden to establish redressability.  Although the court \nacknowledged that it was \u201cpossible\u201d automakers would \nchange their plans and sell more liquid-fuel-powered \nvehicles or vehicles that use more liquid fuel if EPA\u2019s \nwaiver were vacated, it faulted petitioners for failing to \nsupply \u201crecord evidence\u201d to that effect, such as \u201caddi-\ntional affidavits.\u201d  Pet. App. 24a (internal quotation \nmarks omitted).  In the court\u2019s view, it was just as \nlikely that California\u2019s standards have no real-world \nimpact because some manufacturers are already sell-\ning \u201cmore qualifying vehicles in California than the \nState\u2019s standards require.\u201d  Id. at 28a (emphasis omit-\nted) (quoting J.A. 202).  And the court believed that \n\u201cunsupported assumptions regarding the future ac-\ntions of third-party market participants are insuffi-\ncient to establish Article III standing\u201d\u2014full stop.  Id. \nat 29a (internal quotation marks omitted). \nAs explained, the court of appeals\u2019 categorical evi-\ndentiary demand is doubly wrong.  First, it departs \nfrom Bennett and the D.C. Circuit\u2019s own precedent es-\ntablishing that the removal of a regulatory hurdle to \nthe use of the challenger\u2019s product satisfies redressa-\nbility.  See pp. 25-29, supra.  Indeed, the court of ap-\npeals did not even acknowledge its precedent holding \nthat \u201cremov[ing] a regulatory hurdle\u201d to the use of fuel \nsuffices to establish redressability.  Energy Future \nCoal., 793 F.3d at 144.  And second, petitioners were at \nleast entitled to rely on common sense:  automakers \nwould predictably produce more vehicles that use more \n\n37 \n \nliquid fuel if no longer subject to standards mandating \nthe production of certain quantities of electric or fuel-\nefficient vehicles.  See pp. 29-35, supra.   \nNor could the court of appeals rely on supposed \nmarket forces to justify its heightened redressability \nburden.  The limited evidence the court invoked sup-\nported the opposite conclusion.  The court relied on \nCalifornia\u2019s declaration explaining that automakers \nhad sold more electric vehicles than required in 2022\u2014\nlikely in anticipation of the increasingly stringent \nstandards for the ensuing years.  Pet. App. 28a (citing \nJ.A. 202).  That says nothing about how automakers \nwould respond if they did not need to meet California\u2019s \nstandards ever again.  The court also highlighted that \nthe intervening automakers had suggested that \u201cinter-\nnal sustainability forces and external market forces\u201d \nwere resulting in the production of more electric vehi-\ncles.  Id. at 24a n.8 (quoting C.A. Industry Resp.-Int. \nBr. 6-7).  But those automakers never said that every \nautomaker would exceed California\u2019s standards if the \nstandards were vacated.  To the contrary, as petition-\ners explained in reply, five individual automakers in-\ntervened precisely because a decision vacating the \nwaiver would put them at a \u201ccompetitive disad-\nvantage.\u201d  J.A. 211 (quoting C.A. Industry Resp.-Int. \nBr. 17).  That is, those five individual automakers were \nconcerned that other automakers\u2014many of whom have \nremained silent throughout this litigation\u2014would pull \nback their electric-vehicle numbers and instead sell \nmore liquid-fuel-powered vehicles.   \nb.  Even if petitioners were legally required to pro-\nduce record evidence to support redressability, plenty \nsuch evidence existed.  The record included 14 declara-\ntions explaining how California\u2019s standards depress de-\nmand for liquid fuel, and how petitioners\u2019 injuries \n\n38 \n \nwould be ameliorated if the waiver were vacated.  \nOther declarants further noted that California itself \nhad recently projected that the waiver would \u201creduce \nemissions through reductions in fuel production.\u201d  J.A. \n148 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see \nJ.A. 180; see also J.A. 174 (similar statements by Min-\nnesota, which has adopted California\u2019s standards).  Ad-\nditional record evidence likewise documented Califor-\nnia\u2019s position that it needs its greenhouse-gas stand-\nards to reduce motor-vehicle emissions and that doing \nso decreases liquid-fuel consumption.  That included \nCalifornia\u2019s 2021 comment representing that its stand-\nards are \u201ccritical not just for immediate emissions re-\nductions but also\u201d for \u201cgreater emission reductions in \nthe future.\u201d  J.A. 66.  And California elsewhere had \npublicly explained that the standards increase the \nnumber of electric vehicles in use, thereby avoiding \n\u201cproduction and delivery of gasoline.\u201d  J.A. 84.   \nNone of this evidence was enough for the court of \nappeals.  In context, the court apparently thought that \npetitioners could meet their burden of showing re-\ndressability only by providing affidavits from automak-\ners promising to change production or pricing if the \nwaiver were vacated.  This Court has never required \nthe endorsement of a directly regulated third party be-\nfore an indirectly regulated party can sue, and it should \nnot create such a rule now.  Doing so would make it \nimpossible for many parties indirectly affected by gov-\nernment action to secure judicial relief and would cre-\nate incentives for government gamesmanship.  See  \npp. 41-45, infra.  \n\n39 \n \n2. The \ndecision \nbelow \nconflates  \nredressability with mootness \nThe decision below creates additional doctrinal con-\nfusion because it conflates mootness and redressabil-\nity.  The court of appeals thought that the redressabil-\nity inquiry here was \u201cfurther complicated by the rela-\ntively short duration of the waiver.\u201d  Pet. App. 22a.  As \nthe court saw it, petitioners needed to demonstrate not \nonly that manufacturers were likely to respond to a ju-\ndicial decision vacating the waiver by \u201cchanging their \nfleets,\u201d but also that they \u201cwould do so relatively \nquickly\u2014by Model Year 2025\u201d\u2014the year in which the \ncourt believed EPA\u2019s waiver terminated.  Id. at 23a.  In \nthe court\u2019s view, because vehicle product cycles \u201ccan \nalso begin years before a vehicle is launched,\u201d it was \n\u201cfar from clear\u201d that automakers could \u201cchange \ncourse . . . within the model years covered by the \nwaiver.\u201d  Id. at 24a. \nThose (misplaced) timing concerns sound in moot-\nness, not redressability.  Redressability, like the other \nelements of standing, is assessed at the time the suit is \nfiled.  See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 569 n.4.  Here, petitioners \nbrought suit immediately after EPA\u2019s waiver rein-\nstatement in 2022.  At that point, the waiver was sched-\nuled to be in effect for nearly four years.  There was \nample evidence in the record that automakers are at \nleast nimble enough to change a production choice or a \nvehicle price four years in advance\u2014surely enough to \naffect a single dollar of petitioners\u2019 sales.  See pp. 37-\n38, supra; J.A. 209-211.  Indeed, the court of appeals \nrelied on a comment from Toyota explaining that some \nmanufacturers were producing their vehicle fleets one \nyear in advance\u2014which affirmatively undermines the \nnotion that no manufacturer could change plans four \nyears in advance.  Pet. App. 24a; see J.A. 98-100. \n\n40 \n \nGiven that context, the court\u2019s emphasis on the \u201crel-\natively short nature of the waiver\u201d makes sense only as \na concern that the case was approaching model year \n2025 still unresolved.  Pet. App. 25a; see C.A. Oral Arg. \n34:46-34:49 (Garcia, J.) (\u201c[Y]ou need about two more \nyears to plan and adjust how you\u2019re producing vehicles, \nand I don\u2019t see how we can assume that\u2019s going to hap-\npen by model year [20]25.\u201d).  But it \u201cis the doctrine of \nmootness, not standing, that addresses whether \u2018an in-\ntervening circumstance has deprived the plaintiff of a \npersonal stake in the outcome of the lawsuit.\u2019  \u201d  West \nVirginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, 719 (2022) (quoting \nGenesis HealthCare Corp. v. Symczyk, 569 U.S. 66, 72 \n(2013)).  Indeed, the federal government recently ex-\nplained to this Court that when its regulations operate \non a short time horizon, Article III concerns should be \nevaluated under the rubric of mootness, not redressa-\nbility.  See FCC Br. 14, FCC v. Consumers\u2019 Research, \nNo. 24-354 (explaining that the mootness doctrine ap-\nplies when \u201cthe challenged action is in its duration too \nshort to be fully litigated\u201d) (citation omitted). \nThat \u201cdistinction matters\u201d for several reasons.  \nWest Virginia, 597 U.S. at 719.  First, although plain-\ntiffs have the burden to establish Article III standing, \nthe burden flips for mootness.  EPA thus would \u201cbear[] \nthe burden to establish that a once-live case has be-\ncome moot.\u201d  Ibid.  And neither intervenors nor EPA \npointed the court of appeals to evidence sufficient to \nshow that automakers\u2019 decisions have become irrevo-\ncable.  Because the court misconstrued its mootness \nconcern as a redressability obstacle, they had no need \nto.   \nSecond, because mootness would have been a new \ndevelopment, the court below would have had to con-\n\n41 \n \nsider the supplemental record evidence that petition-\ners offered.  Counsel for the state and local government \nintervenors made arguments sounding in mootness for \nthe first time at oral argument.  In response, petition-\ners submitted supplemental declarations from individ-\nuals experienced in vehicle-emission compliance.  \nThose declarations explained that \u201cautomobile manu-\nfacturers could and likely would change their produc-\ntion, pricing, and/or distribution plans for Model Year \n2025 as late as December 2025, but at a minimum well \ninto 2025.\u201d  J.A. 215, 220.  But the court rejected peti-\ntioners\u2019 supplemental brief and accompanying declara-\ntions as too late to show redressability.  Pet. App. 31a.  \nHad the court properly characterized California\u2019s ar-\nguments as newly raised concerns about mootness, \nthere would have been no doubt about the propriety of \npetitioners\u2019 supplemental responses.   \nThird, and critically, mootness doctrine contains ex-\nceptions that redressability does not.  In particular, if \nthere is a concern about the \u201crelatively short nature of \nthe waiver,\u201d Pet. App. 25a, then the case would be an \nexcellent candidate for applying \u201cthe established ex-\nception to mootness for disputes capable of repetition, \nyet evading review.\u201d  Federal Election Comm\u2019n v. Wis-\nconsin Right To Life, Inc., 551 U.S. 449, 462 (2007).  \nBut if that concern is improperly characterized as go-\ning to redressability, the challengers are out of luck.   \n3. The decision below creates bad policy \nThe decision below stacks bad policy on top of bad \nlaw.  It would put injured businesses at the mercy of \nregulated third parties whose interests may not align, \nincentivize agency mischief, and create a one-way \nratchet in favor of regulators over the regulated. \n\n42 \n \na. To start, the court of appeals\u2019 rule means that in-\ndirectly regulated entities will often be unable to chal-\nlenge government action that undeniably injures them.  \nThat is because an indirectly regulated entity\u2019s stand-\ning will often depend on the actions of directly regu-\nlated parties.  And the interests of directly regulated \nparties and downstream or upstream entities often di-\nverge.  That was the case where \u201cworkers challenged a \nDepartment of Labor rule that unlawfully allowed em-\nployers to access inexpensive foreign labor, with the ef-\nfect of lowering American workers\u2019 wages.\u201d  Corner \nPost, 603 U.S. at 836 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring) (cit-\ning Mendoza v. Perez, 754 F.3d 1002 (D.C. Cir. 2014)).  \nIt is also the case where a business challenges under-\nregulation of a competitor.  See, e.g., Monsanto Co.  \nv. Geertson Seed Farms, 561 U.S. 139, 153-156 (2010) \n(conventional alfalfa farmers had standing to challenge \nderegulation of genetically modified alfalfa); General \nMotors Corp., 519 U.S. at 282, 286-287 (purchaser of \nnatural gas had standing to challenge Ohio\u2019s differen-\ntial tax treatment of gas sales by certain Ohio utilities \nand gas sales by out-of-state sellers).  Justiciable \nclaims of under-regulation may also come from outside \nthe industry, as when insurance companies challenged \nthe recission of vehicle safety standards.  See Motor \nVehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of U.S. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. \nIns. Co., 463 U.S. 29 (1983). \nEven when directly regulated entities and upstream \nor downstream entities are not squarely at odds, other \nconsiderations might prevent a regulated party from \njoining the effort to challenge government action.  \nMembers of the directly regulated industry may be \nmore minimally burdened by an action than down-\nstream actors.  The regulated entity may be unwilling \n\n43 \n \nto risk negative publicity by challenging a popular gov-\nernment action, especially if it has less at stake.  The \ngovernment may have effectively purchased the regu-\nlated entity\u2019s cooperation by doling out countervailing \nregulatory benefits.  Or businesses might simply lack \nthe appetite to confront their regulator in court.   \nThose risks are particularly acute in industries that \nrequire lead time to comply with standards.  In such \nindustries, regulated entities may prefer to cooperate \nwith the agency in exchange for certainty about the fu-\nture regulatory environment or other benefits. The \nagency action may still have sweeping effect, but the \nonly viable plaintiffs would have no incentive to bring \nsuit.  That was true here, where automakers had incen-\ntives to cooperate with EPA and California to obtain \nregulatory stability and to avoid the perceived negative \npublicity of interfering with California\u2019s environmental \nefforts.  In short, one industry should not be held hos-\ntage to a related industry\u2019s incentives.   \nb. The decision below creates troubling incentives \nfor agencies, too.  It teaches agencies that they can tar-\nget entire industries with crippling burdens so long as \nthey act through a conduit and placate that conduit.  \nHere, EPA, California, and several automakers en-\ntered into \u201cCalifornia Framework Agreements\u201d com-\nmitting the automakers to accede to California\u2019s stand-\nards in exchange for certain benefits like additional \nlead time.  CARB, Framework Agreements on Clean \nCars (Aug. 17, 2020), https://perma.cc/ZM4Z-GDEK.  \nHaving entered into those agreements, the select au-\ntomakers that intervened in this case were forced into \ndefending California\u2019s standards, lest they be left to \ncompete in a market undisturbed by California\u2019s artifi-\ncial distortions.  But appeasing the directly regulated \nindustry should not insulate agency action from review, \n\n44 \n \nparticularly if that action cripples numerous other in-\ndustries.  \nA too-demanding redressability standard may also \nencourage agencies to act over shorter time horizons to \navoid meaningful review.  Under the reasoning of the \ncourt below, EPA\u2019s latest waiver decision was effec-\ntively unchallengeable because it applied \u201conly\u201d over \nfour years.  Pet. App. 22a.  That reasoning would have \nthe perverse effect of shielding from review the most \nimportant and politically sensitive issues on which \npresidential administrations may disagree.  See, e.g., \nWest Virginia, 597 U.S. at 715-718 (describing the his-\ntory of EPA\u2019s Clean Power Plan across presidential ad-\nministrations).  California\u2019s Section 209(b) waivers for \nclimate-change-focused standards are a perfect exam-\nple:  EPA has granted or rescinded a waiver like clock-\nwork with each change in administration.  An inflated \nredressability standard all but guarantees that these \ncourse-changes mean that agency authority is never \nsettled, even in the most consequential cases.   \nc. Finally, the decision below creates a one-way \nratchet in favor of the regulator over the regulated.  A \nState will always have \u201ca legitimate interest in the con-\ntinued enforceability of its own statutes,\u201d regardless of \ntheir effects.  Maine v. Taylor, 477 U.S. 131, 137 (1986).  \nA State\u2019s interest in vindicating its laws would presum-\nably allow California to challenge or intervene to de-\nfend any decision granting or denying a waiver.  See \nC.A. State & Local Gov. Intervention Mot. 10 (citing \nAlaska v. Department of Transp., 868 F.2d 441, 444 \n(D.C. Cir. 1989)).  As California puts it, with EPA\u2019s \n\u201cwaiver, its standards have legal force; without it, they \ndo not,\u201d so it need not show that the waiver influences \nthe \u201cmix of cars.\u201d  Cal. Br. in Opp. 14 n.5 (citing Alli-\nance for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 382).  But under \n\n45 \n \nthe court of appeals\u2019 theory, industries targeted by \nCalifornia\u2019s laws have no such luck.   \nD. At \nThe \nVery \nLeast, \nPetitioners \nHave  \nEstablished \nRedressability \nBecause \nThe \nChallenged Waiver Continues In Perpetuity  \nIf there were any doubt that petitioners\u2019 injuries are \nredressable, EPA\u2019s recent admission that its waiver \nhas no definite end point should remove it.  Even under \nthe court of appeals\u2019 unduly high bar for redressability, \npetitioners have standing to challenge what EPA now \nfreely describes as an open-ended waiver allowing Cal-\nifornia to impose emission standards in perpetuity.  \n1.  The court of appeals\u2019 standing analysis was \npremised on its assumption that the waiver, and thus \nCalifornia\u2019s standards, would sunset after 2025.  Pet. \nApp. 14a, 22a.  As noted, the court viewed the \u201crela-\ntively short duration of the waiver\u201d as \u201ccomplicat[ing]\u201d \nthe redressability analysis.  Id. at 22a.  According to \nthe court, petitioners needed to demonstrate not only \nthat manufacturers were likely to respond to a judicial \ndecision vacating the waiver by \u201cchanging their fleets,\u201d \nbut also that manufacturers would do so \u201crelatively \nquickly\u2014by Model Year 2025.\u201d  Id. at 23a (emphasis \nadded).  And the court found it \u201cfar from clear\u201d that \nmanufacturers would change their prices or production \ncycles by model year 2025.  Id. at 24a.  \nEPA has now admitted that the D.C. Circuit\u2019s cen-\ntral premise was incorrect.  In opposing certiorari, \nEPA candidly explained that its waiver has no end \ndate.  See EPA Br. in Opp. 12-13.  \u201cContrary to the \ncourt of appeals\u2019 suggestion,\u201d EPA told this Court, the \nwaiver \u201cdoes not expire after model-year 2025.\u201d  Id. at \n12.  When this lawsuit was filed, both the zero- \nemission-vehicle mandate and the greenhouse-gas \nemission standards applied to model year 2025 \u201cand \n\n46 \n \nsubsequent.\u201d  J.A 50 (emphasis added).  In 2022, after \npetitioners sued, California amended its zero-emission-\nvehicle mandate to sunset after model year 2025.  See \np. 16, supra.  But California\u2019s greenhouse-gas emission \nstandards continue to \u201cremain in force\u201d after model \nyear 2025.  EPA Br. in Opp. 13.  So in approving the \nwaiver, EPA approved standards that do not expire un-\nless California chooses to replace them, which it has \nnot done for its greenhouse-gas standards. \nAfter this certiorari petition was fully briefed, EPA \nformalized its position that California\u2019s greenhouse-\ngas emission standards do not sunset.  In its December \n17, 2024 decision granting California\u2019s waiver request \nfor its new Advanced Clean Cars II standards, EPA \nexplained that California\u2019s \u201c[greenhouse-gas] emission \nstandards applicable to 2025 and subsequent model \nyears remain[] unchanged.\u201d  ACC II Decision Docu-\nment 40 n.96.  Those emission standards did not need \nany further approval from EPA; they \u201ccontinue to be \ncovered by EPA\u2019s [Advanced Clean Cars] I waiver is-\nsued in 2013 . . . and reinstated in 2022.\u201d  Ibid. \n2. Given EPA\u2019s newly articulated position, it should \nbe beyond question that vacating the challenged waiver \nwould ameliorate petitioners\u2019 injuries at least to some \ndegree.  Even if the court of appeals were right that it \nwould take several years for every automaker to \nchange its production cycle, Pet. App. 23a, some of the \nrelevant standards are set to govern for more than sev-\neral years.  In other words, while the court below wor-\nried that vehicle manufacturers could not change \ncourse \u201cquickly\u201d enough, ibid., speed should not have \nbeen a concern.  Vacating an indefinite waiver permit-\nting California to enforce stringent emission standards \nwould necessarily have some effect on vehicle pricing, \nproduction, or distribution at some future point\u2014\n\n47 \n \nthereby alleviating at least one dollar of the artificially \ndepressed demand for petitioners\u2019 products.   \nCalifornia and EPA have since made factual find-\nings confirming that the perpetual greenhouse-gas \nemission standards will depress demand for liquid fuel \ninto the next decade.  In recently proposing to approve \nCalifornia\u2019s request to revise its state implementation \nplan, EPA accepted California\u2019s prediction that its \ngreenhouse-gas standards would \u201cachieve additional \ncriteria pollutant emission reductions\u201d in the State \nthrough at least 2037.  89 Fed. Reg. at 82,557 & n.19 \n(citing J.A. 93-94).  Citing the same analysis it had sub-\nmitted when urging EPA to reinstate the challenged \nwaiver, California reiterated that its greenhouse-gas \nemission standards target liquid fuel.  Specifically, Cal-\nifornia attributed the criteria-pollutant reductions to \nthe \u201cavoided production and delivery of gasoline\u201d from \nautomakers\u2019 compliance with those ongoing standards.  \nId. at 82,559 & n.37 (citing J.A. 84).  That analysis\u2014\nembraced by EPA as \u201creasonable and adequately  \nsupported\u201d\u2014recognizes that California\u2019s greenhouse-\ngas emission standards will continue to affect liquid-\nfuel consumption for more than a decade.  Id. at 82,558.  \nAt least one automaker is likely to adjust a single pro-\nduction or pricing decision over that period.   \n* * * \nThis case really is this simple:  petitioners make and \nsell liquid fuels.  EPA\u2019s waiver allows California to en-\nforce standards requiring fewer cars that run on liquid \nfuel.  Indeed, California\u2019s goal is to eliminate reliance \non petitioners\u2019 products entirely.  Removing EPA\u2019s \nwaiver would thus likely cause at least a single cus-\ntomer to purchase at least a dollar\u2019s worth more of pe-\ntitioners\u2019 products.  The legality of EPA\u2019s actions may \n\n48 \n \nraise controversial statutory or political questions, but \ntheir justiciability should never have been in doubt.   \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, this Court should  \nreverse the judgment below. \n \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nERIC D.

The previous searches have likely established the petitioners' position; this action provides the necessary counterpoint. For design, this action reinforces a fundamental and crucial strategy: systematically gathering and analyzing the merits briefs from both sides of a case.

As their case progresses, they \nmust \u201cpoint to factual evidence\u201d establishing that they \nsatisfied the three elements of standing\u2014injury, cau-\nsation, and redressability\u2014as of the time they filed \nsuit.  Murthy v. Missouri, 603 U.S. 43, 57-58 (2024).  \nThe only question here is how to apply those long-set-\ntled requirements to the peculiar circumstances of this \ncase, involving a waiver of preemption under Section \n209(b) of the Clean Air Act. \nAs petitioners describe things, that question is \n\u201cstraightforward\u201d because standing is automatic here.  \nPet. Br. 35.  Petitioners profit from sales of fuel.  They \nnote that the waiver allowed California to impose \nstate standards limiting greenhouse-gas emissions \nacross automakers\u2019 fleets and requiring automakers to \nsell a certain percentage of zero-emission vehicles.  Pe-\ntitioners assert that \u201c[t]hey promptly challenged \nEPA\u2019s waiver,\u201d id. at 20; that the waiver injures peti-\ntioners and their members by \u201creduc[ing] the use of \nliquid fuel,\u201d id.; and that \u201c[s]etting aside EPA\u2019s waiver \nwould . . . end[] the artificial depression of demand for \npetitioners\u2019 products,\u201d id. at 20-21.  Standing was so \n\u201cobvious,\u201d in their view, that they did not \u201cneed to sup-\nply additional record evidence\u201d to establish redressa-\nbility.  Id. at 17, 18. \nBut \u201capplying the law of standing\u201d frequently de-\nmands a \u201cheavily fact-dependent\u201d inquiry, FDA v. All. \nfor Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 384 (2024), and pe-\ntitioners elide the most salient facts in this case.  EPA \ngranted the relevant waiver in 2013.  Petitioners did \nnot challenge that waiver and neither did anyone else.  \nIt remained in effect for more than six years before \n\n \n2 \n \nEPA withdrew it in 2019.  During those six years, in \nresponse to the state standards and wider national \nand global trends, automakers invested heavily in \nchanging their fleets and building consumer demand \nfor electric vehicles.  Consumer preferences and the \nautomobile market evolved.  Even when EPA with-\ndrew the waiver, automakers accelerated their transi-\ntion to electric vehicles and consumer demand \ncontinued to grow. \nIn 2021, when EPA invited comment on whether to \nreinstate the waiver, the state respondents supported \nreinstatement.  As their comment explained, the with-\ndrawal had exceeded EPA\u2019s authority and it deprived \nCalifornia\u2019s regulations of legal effect.  But by the time \nEPA reinstated the waiver and petitioners challenged \nthat decision in 2022, \u201c\u2018both internal sustainability \ngoals and external market forces\u2019\u201d were pushing \n\u201cmanufacturers to transition toward electric vehicles, \nirrespective of California\u2019s regulations.\u201d  Pet. App. 24a \nn.8.  Indeed, publicly available evidence submitted by \nthe state respondents showed that zero-emission vehi-\ncles sold in California in 2022 already exceeded what \nthe relevant standards required.  Consumers were \nwilling to pay substantial price premiums for those ve-\nhicles.  And automakers had strong incentives to keep \nselling them. \nWhen the court of appeals confronted petitioners\u2019 \nchallenge to the reinstatement, it had to assure itself \nof jurisdiction by evaluating whether vacatur of that \nreinstatement would likely lead automakers to make \nchoices that would redress petitioners\u2019 asserted injury.  \nGiven the circumstances when petitioners filed suit in \nMay 2022, would automakers change their fleets or \nprices in a way that would increase demand for peti-\ntioners\u2019 liquid-fuel products?  Or would automakers \n\n \n3 \n \nexceed the requirements of California\u2019s standards for \ntheir own economic and strategic reasons, even with-\nout a legal requirement to do so?  Petitioners submit-\nted no evidence addressing that critical issue.  And \ngiven that absence of proof, the court of appeals \nproperly held that petitioners failed to meet their bur-\nden of demonstrating redressability. \nPetitioners ask this Court to excuse that failure.  \nThey first urge the Court to adopt a new \u201ccategorical \nrule.\u201d  Pet. Br. 4.  Under that rule, redressability \nwould be established automatically whenever peti-\ntioners challenge a regulation that implicates the use \nof their products\u2014even if the regulation applies only \nto third parties, and even where petitioners introduce \nno evidence indicating that those third parties would \nhave acted differently in the regulation\u2019s absence.  Id.  \nIn the alternative, petitioners ask the Court to credit \ntheir unsubstantiated predictions about how au-\ntomakers might respond to a vacatur.  Id. at 30-35.  \nThose arguments find no support in this Court\u2019s prec-\nedent.  Adopting them would effectively eliminate the \nplaintiff\u2019s \u201cburden of showing that third parties will \nlikely react\u201d to a favorable judgment in a way that pro-\nvides redress.  Dep\u2019t of Com. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, \n768 (2019).  And they would allow a court to assume \nredressability even if all the evidence before it indi-\ncates that a favorable judgment would not, in fact, re-\ndress the plaintiffs\u2019 injury.  This Court should reject \npetitioners\u2019 novel standing theories and affirm the \njudgment below. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal and Regulatory Background \n1.  The Clean Air Act directs EPA to prescribe fed-\neral standards governing emissions of air pollutants \n\n \n4 \n \nfrom new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle en-\ngines.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7521.  Section 209(a) of the Act gen-\nerally preempts States and their political subdivisions \nfrom \u201cadopt[ing] or attempt[ing] to enforce any stand-\nard relating to the control of emissions from new mo-\ntor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines.\u201d  Id. \n\u00a7 7543(a).  But Section 209(b) instructs EPA to \u201cwaive \napplication of [Section 209] to any State which ha[d] \nadopted\u201d qualifying emission standards \u201cprior to \nMarch 30, 1966, if the State determines that the State \nstandards will be, in the aggregate, at least as protec-\ntive of public health and welfare as applicable Federal \nstandards.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7543(b)(1).  If a State makes that de-\ntermination, EPA must waive preemption unless it \nmakes one of three enumerated findings.  See id. \n\u00a7 7543(b)(1)(A)-(C). \nCalifornia is the only State eligible for a waiver un-\nder Section 209(b) because it was the only State that \nhad developed qualifying motor vehicle emissions \nstandards before March 30, 1966.  Pet. App. 7a.  \u201cCon-\ngress recognized that California was already the \n\u2018lead[er] in the establishment of standards for regula-\ntion of automative pollutant emissions\u2019 at a time when \nthe federal government had yet to promulgate any reg-\nulations of its own.\u201d  Engine Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 88 \nF.3d 1075, 1079 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  Congress designed \nSection 209 to allow California to continue to serve as \na \u201c\u2018laboratory for innovation,\u2019\u201d id. at 1080, while also \n\u201cavoid[ing] the economic disruption\u201d that would come \nfrom manufacturers \u201chaving to meet fifty-one separate \nsets of emission control requirements,\u201d Motor & \nEquip. Mfrs. Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. EPA, 627 F.2d 1095, 1109 \n(D.C. Cir. 1979); see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7507 (1977 \namendment allowing other States to adopt standards \n\u201cidentical to the California standards for which a \nwaiver has been granted for such model year\u201d); Pet. \n\n \n5 \n \nApp. 9a n.3 (noting that \u201cseventeen states have chosen \nto adopt some portion of the California regulations\u201d). \nCalifornia received its first waiver in 1968 and has \nreceived additional waivers in every subsequent dec-\nade.1  For instance, EPA granted a waiver in 1993 for \nCalifornia\u2019s first Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) regula-\ntion, which required a specific percentage of light-duty \nvehicles to be zero-emission vehicles with no exhaust \nor evaporative emissions.  58 Fed. Reg. 4166 (Jan. 13, \n1993).2  EPA granted another waiver, in 2009, for Cal-\nifornia\u2019s first set of regulations to control greenhouse-\ngas emissions from motor vehicles.  74 Fed. Reg. \n32,744 (July 8, 2009). \n2.  This litigation concerns a set of emissions \nstandards that California adopted in 2012 as part of \nits Advanced Clean Cars I program.  78 Fed. Reg. 2112 \n(Jan. 9, 2013).  As relevant here, those standards in-\ncluded a requirement that automakers reduce the av-\nerage greenhouse-gas emissions across the fleets of \nvehicles they sell in California.  See id. at 2114.  They \nalso included new ZEV standards, requiring manufac-\nturers to meet specified \u201cZEV credit percentage\u201d re-\nquirements.  Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(b) \n(2012).   \nA manufacturer can satisfy the \u201cZEV credit per-\ncentage\u201d in several ways:  by generating credits from \nsales of qualifying vehicles, purchasing credits from \nother manufacturers, using excess credits banked in \nprior years, or applying credits obtained by overcom-\n \n1 See EPA, Vehicle Emissions California Waivers and Authoriza-\ntions, https://tinyurl.com/3rxscztw (last visited Mar. 6, 2025). \n2  See Cal. Air Res. Bd., Low-Emission Vehicle Program,  \nhttps://tinyurl.com/49m28yze (last visited Mar. 6, 2025). \n\n \n6 \n \nplying with the greenhouse-gas emission require-\nments.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(d)(5); 78 \nFed. Reg. at 2119-2120, 2135.  The number of ZEV \ncredits generated by a vehicle sale depends on the ve-\nhicle\u2019s range when operating on electric power.  See \nCal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(d)(5).  For example, a \nplug-in hybrid vehicle with a \u201c50 mile\u201d electric range \nearns one credit, while a fully battery-electric vehicle \nwith a \u201c350 mile\u201d range earns four credits.3  As a re-\nsult, a fleet may satisfy the standards even though \nZEV sales as a percentage of light-duty vehicles sold \nis well below the applicable ZEV credit percentage re-\nquirement.  \nThe Advanced Clean Cars I standards affected \nmodel years beginning in 2017 (for greenhouse-gas \nemissions) and 2018 (for ZEV requirements).  Both \nsets of standards were originally structured to in-\ncrease in stringency through model year 2025 and re-\nmain in effect at 2025 levels for subsequent model \nyears.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1961.3(a)(1)(A) \n(2012); id. \u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2012); J.A. 50.  In 2022, \nhowever, California amended the ZEV standards (but \nnot the greenhouse-gas standards) to expire after \nmodel year 2025.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \n\u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2022).4 \n \n3 78 Fed. Reg. at 2114-2115; see Cal. Air Res. Bd., ACC II ZEV \nTechnology Assessment, at 11-12 tbl. 2 (Apr. 12, 2022) (showing \nelectric ranges of model year 2021 battery and plug-in hybrid ve-\nhicles), https://tinyurl.com/2d2db9vc (last visited Mar. 11, 2025).  \n4  California adopted that amendment because its Advanced \nClean Cars II standards included a new set of ZEV requirements \napplicable to model years 2026 and beyond.  See Cal. Code Regs. \ntit. 13, \u00a7 1962.4(a) (2022).  EPA granted a waiver for the Ad-\nvanced Clean Cars II standards on December 17, 2024.  90 Fed. \n(continued\u2026) \n\n \n7 \n \nCalifornia requested a waiver for the Advanced \nClean Cars I program in 2012.  That request described \nhow the new standards would increase production of \nzero-emission vehicles, thus decreasing emissions of \ncriteria pollutants and greenhouse gases.  J.A. 34-35, \n40-44.  EPA granted the waiver in early 2013.  78 Fed. \nReg. at 2145.  As the Federal Register notice of that \naction observed, petitions for judicial review were due \nby March 11, 2013.  Id.; see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1).  No-\nbody challenged EPA\u2019s decision to grant the waiver. \nMore than six years later, EPA withdrew the parts \nof the waiver at issue in this case.  84 Fed. Reg. 51,310 \n(Sept. 27, 2019).  By that time, automakers had made \n\u201cinvestments to meet\u201d the greenhouse-gas and ZEV \nstandards and \u201chad adjusted their fleets to comply \nwith\u201d them.  Pet. App. 12a; see id. at 124a.  Consumers \nhad grown increasingly familiar with zero-emission \nvehicles.  Even after the waiver was withdrawn, con-\nsumer demand for those vehicles continued to grow \nand automakers continued to announce plans to sell \nthem in greater numbers.  J.A. 191-192, 201-203.  By \n2020, for example, zero-emission vehicles were around \n8% of the new light-duty vehicles registered in Califor-\nnia; that figure jumped to over 12% the following \nyear.5 \nIn 2021, EPA solicited comment on whether it \nshould reinstate the waiver.  The state respondents \nsubmitted a comment in July 2021, explaining that \n \nReg. 642 (2025).  Several challenges to that waiver are now pend-\ning, including one that two of the petitioners here filed on Febru-\nary 28, 2025.  Pet. for Rev., Valero Renewable Fuels Co., LLC v. \nEPA, No. 25-1078 (D.C. Cir.).   \n5 Cal. Energy Comm\u2019n, New ZEV Sales in California, https://ti-\nnyurl.com/pt526fp5 (displaying \u201cZEV Sales Share\u201d in top-right \ncorner when 2020 and 2021 filters are selected). \n\n \n8 \n \nthe withdrawal was unlawful and poorly reasoned.  \nC.A. J.A. 188-215; see J.A. 51-68.  Auto-industry com-\nmenters emphasized the \u201cbillions of dollars of invest-\nment \nin \nelectric \nvehicle \nmanufacturing \nand \ninfrastructure\u201d that automakers had already made as \na result of the 2013 decision to grant the waiver.  J.A. \n103 (National Coalition for Advanced Transportation \ncomment); cf. J.A. 63 (California comment observing \nthat \u201cautomakers have complied with, and often over-\ncomplied with, model years 2017-2020 already\u201d).  EPA \nreinstated the waiver in March 2022.  87 Fed. Reg. \n14,332 (Mar. 14, 2022). \nB. Procedural Background \n1.  The petitioners here are various companies that \nproduce or sell liquid fuels, as well as related trade as-\nsociations.  Pet. App. 2a.  They filed petitions for re-\nview of EPA\u2019s reinstatement decision in the D.C. \nCircuit on May 12, 2022.  Id. at 15a.  The court of ap-\npeals consolidated those cases, along with another \ncase initiated by a group of States led by Ohio.  Id.  \nShortly thereafter, the state respondents here filed an \nunopposed motion for leave to intervene in support of \nEPA, as did various automakers and public-interest \norganizations.  Id. at 15a & nn.4-6; see J.A. 107.  Those \nmotions were granted.  See Pet. App. 15a. \nPetitioners principally argued that EPA\u2019s rein-\nstatement of the waiver contravened the Clean Air \nAct.  Pet. App. 16a.  Before the court of appeals could \nreach the merits of that claim, however, it had to as-\nsure itself of jurisdiction.  Under longstanding circuit \nrules, the opening brief for a petitioner seeking review \nof agency action \u201cmust set forth the basis for the claim \nof standing.\u201d  D.C. Cir. R. 28(a)(7).  And if \u201cstanding is \nnot apparent from the administrative record, the brief \nmust include arguments and evidence establishing the \n\n \n9 \n \nclaim of standing.\u201d  Id.; see also Sierra Club v. EPA, \n292 F.3d 895, 901 (D.C. Cir. 2002). \nPetitioners\u2019 opening brief below devoted just two \nparagraphs to standing.  J.A. 118-119.  Petitioners ex-\nplained that \u201cdepressing the demand\u201d for liquid fuels \n\u201cinjures petitioners and petitioners\u2019 members finan-\ncially.\u201d  Id. at 118.

As their case progresses, they \nmust \u201cpoint to factual evidence\u201d establishing that they \nsatisfied the three elements of standing\u2014injury, cau-\nsation, and redressability\u2014as of the time they filed \nsuit.  Murthy v. Missouri, 603 U.S. 43, 57-58 (2024).  \nThe only question here is how to apply those long-set-\ntled requirements to the peculiar circumstances of this \ncase, involving a waiver of preemption under Section \n209(b) of the Clean Air Act. \nAs petitioners describe things, that question is \n\u201cstraightforward\u201d because standing is automatic here.  \nPet. Br. 35.  Petitioners profit from sales of fuel.  They \nnote that the waiver allowed California to impose \nstate standards limiting greenhouse-gas emissions \nacross automakers\u2019 fleets and requiring automakers to \nsell a certain percentage of zero-emission vehicles.  Pe-\ntitioners assert that \u201c[t]hey promptly challenged \nEPA\u2019s waiver,\u201d id. at 20; that the waiver injures peti-\ntioners and their members by \u201creduc[ing] the use of \nliquid fuel,\u201d id.; and that \u201c[s]etting aside EPA\u2019s waiver \nwould . . . end[] the artificial depression of demand for \npetitioners\u2019 products,\u201d id. at 20-21.  Standing was so \n\u201cobvious,\u201d in their view, that they did not \u201cneed to sup-\nply additional record evidence\u201d to establish redressa-\nbility.  Id. at 17, 18. \nBut \u201capplying the law of standing\u201d frequently de-\nmands a \u201cheavily fact-dependent\u201d inquiry, FDA v. All. \nfor Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 384 (2024), and pe-\ntitioners elide the most salient facts in this case.  EPA \ngranted the relevant waiver in 2013.  Petitioners did \nnot challenge that waiver and neither did anyone else.  \nIt remained in effect for more than six years before \n\n \n2 \n \nEPA withdrew it in 2019.  During those six years, in \nresponse to the state standards and wider national \nand global trends, automakers invested heavily in \nchanging their fleets and building consumer demand \nfor electric vehicles.  Consumer preferences and the \nautomobile market evolved.  Even when EPA with-\ndrew the waiver, automakers accelerated their transi-\ntion to electric vehicles and consumer demand \ncontinued to grow. \nIn 2021, when EPA invited comment on whether to \nreinstate the waiver, the state respondents supported \nreinstatement.  As their comment explained, the with-\ndrawal had exceeded EPA\u2019s authority and it deprived \nCalifornia\u2019s regulations of legal effect.  But by the time \nEPA reinstated the waiver and petitioners challenged \nthat decision in 2022, \u201c\u2018both internal sustainability \ngoals and external market forces\u2019\u201d were pushing \n\u201cmanufacturers to transition toward electric vehicles, \nirrespective of California\u2019s regulations.\u201d  Pet. App. 24a \nn.8.  Indeed, publicly available evidence submitted by \nthe state respondents showed that zero-emission vehi-\ncles sold in California in 2022 already exceeded what \nthe relevant standards required.  Consumers were \nwilling to pay substantial price premiums for those ve-\nhicles.  And automakers had strong incentives to keep \nselling them. \nWhen the court of appeals confronted petitioners\u2019 \nchallenge to the reinstatement, it had to assure itself \nof jurisdiction by evaluating whether vacatur of that \nreinstatement would likely lead automakers to make \nchoices that would redress petitioners\u2019 asserted injury.  \nGiven the circumstances when petitioners filed suit in \nMay 2022, would automakers change their fleets or \nprices in a way that would increase demand for peti-\ntioners\u2019 liquid-fuel products?  Or would automakers \n\n \n3 \n \nexceed the requirements of California\u2019s standards for \ntheir own economic and strategic reasons, even with-\nout a legal requirement to do so?  Petitioners submit-\nted no evidence addressing that critical issue.  And \ngiven that absence of proof, the court of appeals \nproperly held that petitioners failed to meet their bur-\nden of demonstrating redressability. \nPetitioners ask this Court to excuse that failure.  \nThey first urge the Court to adopt a new \u201ccategorical \nrule.\u201d  Pet. Br. 4.  Under that rule, redressability \nwould be established automatically whenever peti-\ntioners challenge a regulation that implicates the use \nof their products\u2014even if the regulation applies only \nto third parties, and even where petitioners introduce \nno evidence indicating that those third parties would \nhave acted differently in the regulation\u2019s absence.  Id.  \nIn the alternative, petitioners ask the Court to credit \ntheir unsubstantiated predictions about how au-\ntomakers might respond to a vacatur.  Id. at 30-35.  \nThose arguments find no support in this Court\u2019s prec-\nedent.  Adopting them would effectively eliminate the \nplaintiff\u2019s \u201cburden of showing that third parties will \nlikely react\u201d to a favorable judgment in a way that pro-\nvides redress.  Dep\u2019t of Com. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, \n768 (2019).  And they would allow a court to assume \nredressability even if all the evidence before it indi-\ncates that a favorable judgment would not, in fact, re-\ndress the plaintiffs\u2019 injury.  This Court should reject \npetitioners\u2019 novel standing theories and affirm the \njudgment below. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal and Regulatory Background \n1.  The Clean Air Act directs EPA to prescribe fed-\neral standards governing emissions of air pollutants \n\n \n4 \n \nfrom new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle en-\ngines.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7521.  Section 209(a) of the Act gen-\nerally preempts States and their political subdivisions \nfrom \u201cadopt[ing] or attempt[ing] to enforce any stand-\nard relating to the control of emissions from new mo-\ntor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines.\u201d  Id. \n\u00a7 7543(a).  But Section 209(b) instructs EPA to \u201cwaive \napplication of [Section 209] to any State which ha[d] \nadopted\u201d qualifying emission standards \u201cprior to \nMarch 30, 1966, if the State determines that the State \nstandards will be, in the aggregate, at least as protec-\ntive of public health and welfare as applicable Federal \nstandards.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7543(b)(1).  If a State makes that de-\ntermination, EPA must waive preemption unless it \nmakes one of three enumerated findings.  See id. \n\u00a7 7543(b)(1)(A)-(C). \nCalifornia is the only State eligible for a waiver un-\nder Section 209(b) because it was the only State that \nhad developed qualifying motor vehicle emissions \nstandards before March 30, 1966.  Pet. App. 7a.  \u201cCon-\ngress recognized that California was already the \n\u2018lead[er] in the establishment of standards for regula-\ntion of automative pollutant emissions\u2019 at a time when \nthe federal government had yet to promulgate any reg-\nulations of its own.\u201d  Engine Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 88 \nF.3d 1075, 1079 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  Congress designed \nSection 209 to allow California to continue to serve as \na \u201c\u2018laboratory for innovation,\u2019\u201d id. at 1080, while also \n\u201cavoid[ing] the economic disruption\u201d that would come \nfrom manufacturers \u201chaving to meet fifty-one separate \nsets of emission control requirements,\u201d Motor & \nEquip. Mfrs. Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. EPA, 627 F.2d 1095, 1109 \n(D.C. Cir. 1979); see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7507 (1977 \namendment allowing other States to adopt standards \n\u201cidentical to the California standards for which a \nwaiver has been granted for such model year\u201d); Pet. \n\n \n5 \n \nApp. 9a n.3 (noting that \u201cseventeen states have chosen \nto adopt some portion of the California regulations\u201d). \nCalifornia received its first waiver in 1968 and has \nreceived additional waivers in every subsequent dec-\nade.1  For instance, EPA granted a waiver in 1993 for \nCalifornia\u2019s first Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) regula-\ntion, which required a specific percentage of light-duty \nvehicles to be zero-emission vehicles with no exhaust \nor evaporative emissions.  58 Fed. Reg. 4166 (Jan. 13, \n1993).2  EPA granted another waiver, in 2009, for Cal-\nifornia\u2019s first set of regulations to control greenhouse-\ngas emissions from motor vehicles.  74 Fed. Reg. \n32,744 (July 8, 2009). \n2.  This litigation concerns a set of emissions \nstandards that California adopted in 2012 as part of \nits Advanced Clean Cars I program.  78 Fed. Reg. 2112 \n(Jan. 9, 2013).  As relevant here, those standards in-\ncluded a requirement that automakers reduce the av-\nerage greenhouse-gas emissions across the fleets of \nvehicles they sell in California.  See id. at 2114.  They \nalso included new ZEV standards, requiring manufac-\nturers to meet specified \u201cZEV credit percentage\u201d re-\nquirements.  Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(b) \n(2012).   \nA manufacturer can satisfy the \u201cZEV credit per-\ncentage\u201d in several ways:  by generating credits from \nsales of qualifying vehicles, purchasing credits from \nother manufacturers, using excess credits banked in \nprior years, or applying credits obtained by overcom-\n \n1 See EPA, Vehicle Emissions California Waivers and Authoriza-\ntions, https://tinyurl.com/3rxscztw (last visited Mar. 6, 2025). \n2  See Cal. Air Res. Bd., Low-Emission Vehicle Program,  \nhttps://tinyurl.com/49m28yze (last visited Mar. 6, 2025). \n\n \n6 \n \nplying with the greenhouse-gas emission require-\nments.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(d)(5); 78 \nFed. Reg. at 2119-2120, 2135.  The number of ZEV \ncredits generated by a vehicle sale depends on the ve-\nhicle\u2019s range when operating on electric power.  See \nCal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(d)(5).  For example, a \nplug-in hybrid vehicle with a \u201c50 mile\u201d electric range \nearns one credit, while a fully battery-electric vehicle \nwith a \u201c350 mile\u201d range earns four credits.3  As a re-\nsult, a fleet may satisfy the standards even though \nZEV sales as a percentage of light-duty vehicles sold \nis well below the applicable ZEV credit percentage re-\nquirement.  \nThe Advanced Clean Cars I standards affected \nmodel years beginning in 2017 (for greenhouse-gas \nemissions) and 2018 (for ZEV requirements).  Both \nsets of standards were originally structured to in-\ncrease in stringency through model year 2025 and re-\nmain in effect at 2025 levels for subsequent model \nyears.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1961.3(a)(1)(A) \n(2012); id. \u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2012); J.A. 50.  In 2022, \nhowever, California amended the ZEV standards (but \nnot the greenhouse-gas standards) to expire after \nmodel year 2025.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \n\u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2022).4 \n \n3 78 Fed. Reg. at 2114-2115; see Cal. Air Res. Bd., ACC II ZEV \nTechnology Assessment, at 11-12 tbl. 2 (Apr. 12, 2022) (showing \nelectric ranges of model year 2021 battery and plug-in hybrid ve-\nhicles), https://tinyurl.com/2d2db9vc (last visited Mar. 11, 2025).  \n4  California adopted that amendment because its Advanced \nClean Cars II standards included a new set of ZEV requirements \napplicable to model years 2026 and beyond.  See Cal. Code Regs. \ntit. 13, \u00a7 1962.4(a) (2022).  EPA granted a waiver for the Ad-\nvanced Clean Cars II standards on December 17, 2024.  90 Fed. \n(continued\u2026) \n\n \n7 \n \nCalifornia requested a waiver for the Advanced \nClean Cars I program in 2012.  That request described \nhow the new standards would increase production of \nzero-emission vehicles, thus decreasing emissions of \ncriteria pollutants and greenhouse gases.  J.A. 34-35, \n40-44.  EPA granted the waiver in early 2013.  78 Fed. \nReg. at 2145.  As the Federal Register notice of that \naction observed, petitions for judicial review were due \nby March 11, 2013.  Id.; see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1).  No-\nbody challenged EPA\u2019s decision to grant the waiver. \nMore than six years later, EPA withdrew the parts \nof the waiver at issue in this case.  84 Fed. Reg. 51,310 \n(Sept. 27, 2019).  By that time, automakers had made \n\u201cinvestments to meet\u201d the greenhouse-gas and ZEV \nstandards and \u201chad adjusted their fleets to comply \nwith\u201d them.  Pet. App. 12a; see id. at 124a.  Consumers \nhad grown increasingly familiar with zero-emission \nvehicles.  Even after the waiver was withdrawn, con-\nsumer demand for those vehicles continued to grow \nand automakers continued to announce plans to sell \nthem in greater numbers.  J.A. 191-192, 201-203.  By \n2020, for example, zero-emission vehicles were around \n8% of the new light-duty vehicles registered in Califor-\nnia; that figure jumped to over 12% the following \nyear.5 \nIn 2021, EPA solicited comment on whether it \nshould reinstate the waiver.  The state respondents \nsubmitted a comment in July 2021, explaining that \n \nReg. 642 (2025).  Several challenges to that waiver are now pend-\ning, including one that two of the petitioners here filed on Febru-\nary 28, 2025.  Pet. for Rev., Valero Renewable Fuels Co., LLC v. \nEPA, No. 25-1078 (D.C. Cir.).   \n5 Cal. Energy Comm\u2019n, New ZEV Sales in California, https://ti-\nnyurl.com/pt526fp5 (displaying \u201cZEV Sales Share\u201d in top-right \ncorner when 2020 and 2021 filters are selected). \n\n \n8 \n \nthe withdrawal was unlawful and poorly reasoned.  \nC.A. J.A. 188-215; see J.A. 51-68.  Auto-industry com-\nmenters emphasized the \u201cbillions of dollars of invest-\nment \nin \nelectric \nvehicle \nmanufacturing \nand \ninfrastructure\u201d that automakers had already made as \na result of the 2013 decision to grant the waiver.  J.A. \n103 (National Coalition for Advanced Transportation \ncomment); cf. J.A. 63 (California comment observing \nthat \u201cautomakers have complied with, and often over-\ncomplied with, model years 2017-2020 already\u201d).  EPA \nreinstated the waiver in March 2022.  87 Fed. Reg. \n14,332 (Mar. 14, 2022). \nB. Procedural Background \n1.  The petitioners here are various companies that \nproduce or sell liquid fuels, as well as related trade as-\nsociations.  Pet. App. 2a.  They filed petitions for re-\nview of EPA\u2019s reinstatement decision in the D.C. \nCircuit on May 12, 2022.  Id. at 15a.  The court of ap-\npeals consolidated those cases, along with another \ncase initiated by a group of States led by Ohio.  Id.  \nShortly thereafter, the state respondents here filed an \nunopposed motion for leave to intervene in support of \nEPA, as did various automakers and public-interest \norganizations.  Id. at 15a & nn.4-6; see J.A. 107.  Those \nmotions were granted.  See Pet. App. 15a. \nPetitioners principally argued that EPA\u2019s rein-\nstatement of the waiver contravened the Clean Air \nAct.  Pet. App. 16a.  Before the court of appeals could \nreach the merits of that claim, however, it had to as-\nsure itself of jurisdiction.  Under longstanding circuit \nrules, the opening brief for a petitioner seeking review \nof agency action \u201cmust set forth the basis for the claim \nof standing.\u201d  D.C. Cir. R. 28(a)(7).  And if \u201cstanding is \nnot apparent from the administrative record, the brief \nmust include arguments and evidence establishing the \n\n \n9 \n \nclaim of standing.\u201d  Id.; see also Sierra Club v. EPA, \n292 F.3d 895, 901 (D.C. Cir. 2002). \nPetitioners\u2019 opening brief below devoted just two \nparagraphs to standing.  J.A. 118-119.  Petitioners ex-\nplained that \u201cdepressing the demand\u201d for liquid fuels \n\u201cinjures petitioners and petitioners\u2019 members finan-\ncially.\u201d  Id. at 118.  They cited documents from Cali-\nfornia\u2019s 2011 rulemaking in which a California agency \nhad forecast the prospect of financial injury to oil and \ngas industry participants.  Id. (citing C.A. J.A. 799, \n801, 830, 832).  Petitioners asserted that \u201c[t]his eco-\nnomic injury . . . is caused by the challenged regula-\ntory action, and this Court can redress that injury by \nsetting aside the action.\u201d  J.A. 118.  They attached 14 \ndeclarations, but the only discussion of redressability \nin those declarations consisted of unsupported asser-\ntions that vacatur would remedy petitioners\u2019 injury.  \nId. at 130, 137, 150, 154, 158, 167. \nIn response, the state respondents argued that pe-\ntitioners had failed to establish standing, emphasizing \nthat petitioners provided no evidence that vacatur of \nthe reinstatement decision in May 2022 would change \nautomakers\u2019 behavior in a way that would increase \nfuel sales.  J.A. 185-187.  The state respondents also \nsubmitted evidence undermining the likelihood of any \nsuch change:  by 2022, sales of zero-emission vehicles \nin California exceeded what was required by the rele-\nvant standards; consumer demand for those vehicles \nwas growing, as was consumer willingness to pay price \npremiums; and many manufacturers had announced \nplans for even greater zero-emission vehicle sales in \nthe future.  Id. at 191-195, 201-203.  On reply, peti-\ntioners did not submit record evidence countering the \nstate respondents\u2019 evidence about the circumstances \nin 2022.  See id. at 209-211. \n\n \n10 \n \nAt oral argument, the panel questioned petitioners \nabout jurisdiction, with a particular focus on the \u201car-\ngument that you haven\u2019t demonstrated redressabil-\nity.\u201d  C.A. Oral Arg. 25:50-26:12.  Two weeks later, \npetitioners sought leave to file a supplemental brief \nand to supplement the record with two new declara-\ntions.  Pet. App. 30a.  The proposed brief and declara-\ntions mostly addressed the separate issue of mootness.  \nSee C.A. Private Pet. Proposed Supp. Br. 1-3, 4-13.  In \na short section on standing, petitioners characterized \nthe arguments against redressability as \u201cimplausible\u201d \nand \u201cincredible,\u201d id. at 3, 4\u2014but again cited no evi-\ndence establishing how judicial relief in May 2022 \nwould have redressed their asserted injuries, and did \nnot attempt to counter the state respondents\u2019 evidence \non that point.   \n2.  The court of appeals concluded that it lacked ju-\nrisdiction to decide petitioners\u2019 challenge because pe-\ntitioners had failed to establish Article III standing.  \nPet. App. 16a-19a.  Without deciding whether petition-\ners had established injury or causation, the court ex-\nplained that petitioners fell \u201cfar short of meeting their \nburden\u201d to establish a likelihood \u201cthat their alleged \ninjuries would be redressed\u201d if the court agreed with \npetitioners\u2019 merits theory and vacated EPA\u2019s rein-\nstatement decision.  Id. at 21a. \nAs the court explained, redressability for petition-\ners \u201c\u2018hinge[d] on\u2019 the actions of third parties\u2014the au-\ntomobile manufacturers who are subject to the \nwaiver.\u201d  Pet. App. 22a.  Petitioners needed to show \nthat automakers would respond to vacatur of the rein-\nstatement \u201cby producing and selling fewer non-con-\nventional vehicles or by altering the prices of their \nvehicles such that fewer non-conventional vehicles\u2014\nand more conventional vehicles\u2014were sold.\u201d  Id.  But \n\n \n11 \n \nthe record indicated \u201cthat \u2018manufacturers are already \nselling more qualifying vehicles in California than the \nState\u2019s standards require,\u2019\u201d id. at 28a, and \u201cthat \u2018both \ninternal sustainability goals and external market \nforces\u2019 are prompting manufacturers to transition to-\nward electric vehicles, irrespective of California\u2019s reg-\nulations,\u201d id. at 24a n.8; see also id. at 28a. \nNevertheless, the court of appeals observed, peti-\ntioners \u201ctreated redressability as a foregone conclu-\nsion\u201d instead of making a factual showing.  Pet. App. \n25a.  They did not \u201cattempt[] to explain in any detail \nhow their injuries are redressable, let alone to \u2018cit[e] \nany record evidence\u2019 or to file \u2018additional affidavits or \nother evidence sufficient to support\u2019 redressability.\u201d  \nId. at 24a-25a.  Nor did petitioners \u201cmeaningfully ad-\ndress[]\u201d redressability on reply, after the state re-\nspondents \nintroduced \narguments \nand \nevidence \ncontesting redressability.  Id. at 28a.  \u201cUltimately, the \nrecord evidence, coupled with the filings of the EPA \nand intervenors, provide[d] th[e] Court with no basis \nto conclude that Petitioners\u2019 claims are redressable\u2014\na necessary element of standing that Petitioners bear \nthe burden of establishing.\u201d  Id. at 29a. \nThe court of appeals also described its understand-\ning that the challenge before it \u201cconcern[ed] only\u201d the \nreinstatement of the waiver \u201cas to Model Years 2017 \nthrough 2025.\u201d  Pet. App. 22a.  But see supra p. 6; infra \np. 44.  On that understanding, the court explained, pe-\ntitioners had to show \u201cnot only that automobile man-\nufacturers are likely to respond to a decision by this \nCourt by changing their fleets in a way that alleviates \n[petitioners\u2019] injuries in some way, but also that auto-\nmobile manufacturers would do so relatively quickly\u2014\nby Model Year 2025.\u201d  Pet. App. 23a.  That timing ele-\n\n \n12 \n \nment \u201cfurther complicated\u201d the redressability analy-\nsis,\u201d in the court\u2019s view.  Id. at 22a.  \u201c[E]ven if\u201d peti-\ntioners \nhad \nestablished \nthat \n\u201cautomobile \nmanufacturers were inclined to change course\u201d in re-\nsponse to a vacatur in a way that would increase fuel \nsales, it was \u201cfar from clear that they could do so\u201d by \nmodel year 2025.  Id. at 24a; see id. at 23a. \nFinally, the court of appeals denied petitioners\u2019 \npost-argument motion for leave to file a supplemental \nbrief and declarations.  Pet. App. 30a-32a.  The court \nexplained that, under the circumstances, petitioners \nshould have understood their obligation to address re-\ndressability in their opening brief.  Id. at 31a.  Moreo-\nver, \u201c[p]etitioners offer[ed] no explanation for having \nfailed to address redressability in their reply brief af-\nter California raised the issue in its opposition brief.\u201d  \nId. at 32a. \nPetitioners did not seek panel rehearing or rehear-\ning en banc.  They instead filed a petition for a writ of \ncertiorari respecting both the redressability question \nand the merits of their statutory claim (which the \ncourt of appeals had not reached).  This Court granted \ncertiorari on the redressability question only.6 \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nPetitioners sought a judgment vacating EPA\u2019s re-\ninstatement of a nearly decade-old waiver.  Under set-\ntled precedent, petitioners had the burden of \nestablishing that automakers would likely respond to \n \n6 This Court also denied a petition for certiorari filed by Ohio and \nother petitioners, which advanced a separate constitutional \nclaim.  See Ohio v. EPA, No. 24-13 (Dec. 16, 2024).  The court of \nappeals had held that the Ohio petitioners established standing \nto bring that claim, but it rejected the claim on the merits.  See \nPet. App. 32a-49a. \n\n \n13 \n \nthat vacatur in ways that would increase demand for \npetitioners\u2019 liquid-fuel products.  By the time they \nfiled suit in May 2022, however, the likely effect of a \nvacatur was not self-evident:  in the nine years since \nEPA first granted the waiver, automakers had made \nenormous investments in producing and marketing \nzero-emission vehicles; consumer demand for those ve-\nhicles had recently surged; and evidence before the \nCourt indicated that automakers would continue to \nsell those vehicles in large numbers regardless of the \nreinstatement or its potential vacatur.  Article III re-\nquired petitioners to introduce current evidence but-\ntressing their assertion that a vacatur in 2022 would \nlead automakers to change their fleets or prices in \nways that would increase liquid-fuel sales.  Because \npetitioners did not even attempt to do so, the court of \nappeals properly held that they failed to establish \nstanding. \nIn this Court, petitioners advance several novel \ntheories for why they had no obligation to introduce \nany evidence of redressability.  None of those theories \nis persuasive.  They first propose a categorical rule \nthat redressability is automatically established when-\never a challenged government action implicates the \nuse of the challenger\u2019s products.  Pet. Br. 17-18.  Prec-\nedent forecloses that proposal:  this Court has consist-\nently focused on the particular facts of a case\u2014and \nrequired challengers to submit specific evidence sup-\nporting redressability before obtaining a final judg-\nment.  For similar reasons, plaintiffs may not rely on \nunsupported predictions about the effects of a judg-\nment on a third party\u2019s choices.  See id. at 18.  They \nmust instead meet \u201ctheir burden of showing that third \nparties will likely react in predictable ways\u201d by intro-\nducing actual evidence.  Dep\u2019t of Com. v. New York, \n588 U.S. 752, 768 (2019).  And the fact that a statute \n\n \n14 \n \nor regulation \u201cdoes not sunset\u201d (Pet. Br. 19) does not, \nby itself, establish standing to challenge it. \nFinally, petitioners\u2019 belated attempts to identify \nrecord evidence supporting redressability cannot \nchange the outcome here.  Their briefs and declara-\ntions below were conclusory on the subject of redress-\nability.  The additional evidence they describe in this \nCourt not only comes too late, it would have been in-\nsufficient even if they had presented it below:  it con-\nsists of outdated projections that cannot substitute for \nevidence about the market as it existed when petition-\ners filed this challenge in May 2022. \nARGUMENT \nI. PETITIONERS FAILED TO ESTABLISH REDRESSA-\nBILITY \nPetitioners had the burden to establish standing.  \nAs to redressability, they had to show that judicial va-\ncatur of the reinstatement decision at the time they \nfiled suit in May 2022 would likely lead to increased \nfuel sales.  They failed to carry that burden.   \nA. It Was Petitioners\u2019 Burden to Introduce \nEvidence Establishing Each Element of \nArticle III Standing \nBefore turning to the merits of a suit, a court must \nassure itself of jurisdiction.  Summers v. Earth Island \nInst., 555 U.S. 488, 499 (2009).  The \u201cburden of estab-\nlishing\u201d jurisdiction lies with \u201cthe party asserting ju-\nrisdiction.\u201d  Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., \n511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994) (citing McNutt v. Gen.

Defs. of Wildlife, 504 \n\n \n15 \n \nU.S. 555, 560 (1992).  The doctrine of standing is built \non \u201cthe idea of separation of powers.\u201d  United States v. \nTexas, 599 U.S. 670, 675 (2023).  It \u201cimplements \u2018the \nFramers\u2019 concept of the proper\u2014and properly lim-\nited\u2014role of the courts in a democratic society.\u2019\u201d  FDA \nv. All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 380 (2024) \n(quoting Roberts, Article III Limits on Statutory \nStanding, 42 Duke L.J. 1219, 1220 (1993)). \nThe \u201cirreducible constitutional minimum of stand-\ning contains three elements.\u201d  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560.  \nFirst, the party bringing suit \u201cmust have suffered an \n\u2018injury in fact.\u2019\u201d  Id.  Second, that injury must \u201cbe \n\u2018fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defend-\nant, and not the result of the independent action of \nsome third party not before the court.\u2019\u201d  Id. (altera-\ntions omitted).  And third, \u201cit must be \u2018likely,\u2019 as op-\nposed to merely \u2018speculative,\u2019 that the injury will be \n\u2018redressed by a favorable decision.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 561.  Each \nelement is assessed as of the time the suit commenced.  \nMurthy v. Missouri, 603 U.S. 43, 58 (2024). \nA party seeking to invoke the jurisdiction of a fed-\neral court \u201cmust support each element of standing \n\u2018with the manner and degree of evidence required at \nthe successive stages of the litigation.\u2019\u201d  Murthy, 603 \nU.S. at 58.  At the outset of litigation, \u201c\u2018mere allega-\ntions\u2019\u201d may suffice; as the case progresses, a party \n\u201cmust . . . point to factual evidence.\u201d  Id.  A petitioner \nwho challenges agency action may be able to carry its \nburden by identifying evidence in the administrative \nrecord that establishes its standing.  See, e.g., Sierra \nClub v. EPA, 292 F.3d 895, 899-900 (D.C. Cir. 2002).  \nBut if \u201cstanding is not apparent from the administra-\ntive record,\u201d a petitioner\u2019s \u201cbrief must include argu-\nments and evidence establishing the claim of \nstanding.\u201d  D.C. Cir. R. 28(a)(7); see Sierra Club, 292 \n\n \n16 \n \nF.3d at 900; see generally 15 Redish, Moore\u2019s Federal \nPractice \u00a7\u00a7 101.31, 101.61[10] (3d ed. & Supp. 2025). \nSometimes standing analysis is straightforward.  \nFor instance, in some cases the party invoking the \ncourt\u2019s jurisdiction is itself \u201can object of\u201d the chal-\nlenged government action.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.  \nThe government might, for example, proscribe speech \nthat the plaintiff engages in.  See, e.g., Susan B. An-\nthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 161-167 (2014).  \nOr it might require a state plaintiff to engage in par-\nticular regulation.  See, e.g., West Virginia v. EPA, 597 \nU.S. 697, 718-719 (2022).  In those scenarios, \u201cthere is \nordinarily little question that the action . . . has \ncaused [the plaintiff] injury, and that a judgment pre-\nventing . . . the action will redress\u201d that injury.  Lujan, \n504 U.S. at 561-562; see All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 \nU.S. at 382. \nIn other scenarios, \u201cmuch more is needed.\u201d  Lujan, \n504 U.S. at 562.  When a party\u2019s \u201casserted injury \narises from the government\u2019s allegedly unlawful regu-\nlation . . . of someone else,\u201d for example, standing can \nbe \u201c\u2018substantially more difficult\u2019 to establish.\u201d  Id.  In \nthose cases, \u201ccausation and redressability ordinarily \nhinge on the response of\u201d that third party\u2014\u201cand per-\nhaps on the response of others as well.\u201d  Id.  Because \nthe inquiry turns on \u201cchoices made by independent ac-\ntors not before the courts,\u201d the plaintiff must \u201cadduce \nfacts showing that those choices have been or will be \nmade in such manner as to produce causation and per-\nmit redressability of injury.\u201d  Id.  For instance, if plain-\ntiffs are injured by the lack of affordable private \nhousing, they must show \u201can actionable causal rela-\ntionship\u201d between the challenged zoning ordinance \nand the choices of private third parties who build and \nsell housing.  Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 507 \n\n \n17 \n \n(1975).  Their claim may not proceed if the asserted \ninjury instead results from \u201cthe economics of the area \nhousing market.\u201d  Id. at 506; see generally id. at 508 \n(requiring the party \u201cwho seeks to challenge\u201d a gov-\nernment action to introduce \u201cspecific, concrete facts \ndemonstrating . . . that he personally would benefit in \na tangible way from the court\u2019s intervention\u201d). \nConcrete evidence from the plaintiff is especially \ncritical if another party has introduced evidence un-\ndermining the asserted theory of standing.  \u201cWhen \nchallenged by . . . an opposing party,\u201d for example, a \nplaintiff \u201cinvoking the court\u2019s jurisdiction cannot \nsimply allege a nonobvious harm, without more.\u201d  \nWittman v. Personhuballah, 578 U.S. 539, 545 (2016).  \nAnd if \u201cthere is no \u2018more,\u2019\u201d then there is no jurisdic-\ntion.  Id.; see generally Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U.S. \n77, 96-97 (2010) (when defendants raise facts calling \njurisdiction into doubt, plaintiffs \u201cmust support their \nallegations by competent proof\u201d). \nB. The Circumstances of This Case Raised a \nSerious Question as to Whether Petition-\ners\u2019 Claim Was Redressable \nAs the court of appeals recognized, this is not a case \nwhere standing is self-evident.  Petitioners comprise \ncompanies that produce or refine fuel, companies that \ndevelop biorefining technology, and various trade as-\nsociations (for energy companies, farmers, and con-\nvenience store owners).  Pet. Br. II-V, 20.  They claim \nan injury of financial harm from reduced fuel sales.  \nId. at 21-22.  But the standards at issue here do not \nregulate fuel production or sales.  Instead, the stand-\nards regulate an activity in which petitioners do not \nparticipate:  automobile sales.  Because petitioners are \nnot directly regulated by the challenged agency action, \n\n \n18 \n \nthey needed to identify evidence showing that au-\ntomakers who are subject to those standards would \nmake choices that would \u201cproduce causation and per-\nmit redressability of injury.\u201d  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 562. \nPetitioners\u2019 theory is that the state emissions \nstandards injure them by effectively requiring au-\ntomakers to sell more \u201cvehicles that use less or no liq-\nuid fuel,\u201d which reduces demand for petitioners\u2019 \nproducts.  Pet. Br. 17.  They posit that their revenues \nwould increase if the standards no longer had legal ef-\nfect, because automakers would then make and sell \nmore cars that run on liquid fuel.  Id. at 24.  That the-\nory would indeed have been \u201cstraightforward\u201d (id. at \n35) if petitioners had promptly sought review follow-\ning EPA\u2019s original approval of the waiver in 2013\u2014as \nthey recently did in challenging the Advanced Clean \nCars II waiver, see supra p. 6 n.4.7 \nIn calendar year 2013, zero-emission vehicles made \nup about 2% of light-duty vehicle sales in California.8  \nTo meet the \u201cminimum ZEV credit percentage\u201d re-\nquirements of the Advanced Clean Cars I standards, \n \n7 Petitioners have suggested that D.C. Circuit precedent prohib-\nited them from challenging the 2013 action because California \ndeemed compliance with federal standards to satisfy the state \nstandards.  See Pet. 8 (citing Chamber of Com. of U.S. v. EPA, \n642 F.3d 192, 206 (D.C. Cir. 2011)); Pet. Br. 8-9.  But California\u2019s \nZEV standards\u2014the main focus of petitioners\u2019 present chal-\nlenge\u2014never contained a \u201cdeemed-to-comply\u201d provision, and \nthus could have been challenged in 2013.  J.A. 59-60 n.14 \n(deemed-to-comply provision \u201conly applies to the [greenhouse-\ngas] standard\u201d). \n8 See Cal. Air Res. Bd., California\u2019s Advanced Clean Cars Mid-\nterm Review, App. B, at B15 fig. 9 (Jan. 18, 2017), https://ti-\nnyurl.com/yrzdx3t4. \n\n \n19 \n \nautomakers needed to grow their zero-emission vehi-\ncle sales many times over:  they would have to meet a \nminimum credit percentage of 4.5% by model year \n2018, rising to 22% by model year 2025.  Cal. Code \nRegs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2012).  Regulators es-\ntimated that meeting that 22% credit requirement \nwould require zero-emission vehicles to comprise \nabout 15% of light-duty new-vehicle sales by 2025.  See \nJ.A. 16, 32; 78 Fed. Reg. 2112, 2119 (Jan. 9, 2013).  Ab-\nsent the new regulatory requirement, there was no \nreason to think automakers would make that shift for \ntheir own independent reasons.  Consumers in 2013 \nwere largely unfamiliar with zero-emission vehicles or \nhad a negative impression of them.9  And automakers \nwarned that \u201cconsumer demand for ZEVs\u201d was so ane-\nmic that they might not even be able to meet the re-\nquirements for model year 2018.  78 Fed. Reg. at 2140.   \nBut petitioner challenged EPA\u2019s reinstatement of \nthe waiver nearly a decade later.  By then, companies \nhad been \u201cmaking investments\u201d for years \u201cin updating \ntheir fleets and growing consumer demand for electric \nvehicles.\u201d  Pet. App. 12a, 14a.

See J.A. 191 (national \nmarket share of qualifying vehicles \u201calmost tripled\u201d \nacross that two-year period).

Br. 18, 34, 35) in \nMay 2022 that reduced sales of petitioners\u2019 fuel prod-\nucts were caused by the reinstatement of the waiver\u2014\ninstead of market forces and automakers\u2019 prior invest-\nments and plans.  Nor was it obvious that vacatur of \nthe reinstatement would likely affect automakers\u2019 fu-\nture behavior in a way that would redress the asserted \ninjury. \nIndeed, evidence submitted by the state respond-\nents indicated the opposite.  Publicly accessible sales \ndata showed that \u201czero-emission vehicles sold in cal-\nendar year 2022\u201d in California \u201cexceed what [the] \nstandards require.\u201d  J.A. 192.  For that calendar year, \nabout 19% of light-duty vehicles sold in the State qual-\nified as zero-emission vehicles under California\u2019s \nstandards\u2014exceeding the 15% that regulators had \nforecast would be needed for compliance.  Id. at 191-\n192; see supra p. 19.  The lion\u2019s share of those sales \n(16% of total light-duty sales) were battery-electric ve-\nhicles.13   \nThat represented a surge in sales of battery-elec-\ntric vehicles that far outpaced early forecasts.  The \nforecasts had projected that automakers would need \nbattery-electric vehicles to be just 3.7% of total light-\nduty sales by model year 2025 to meet the credit re-\nquirements of the ZEV standards.  J.A. 9.  The unex-\npected consumer shift to battery-electric vehicles \n(rather than plug-in hybrids, as forecasters originally \n \n13\n New \nZEV \nSales \nin \nCalifornia, \nsupra, \nhttps://ti-\nnyurl.com/pt526fp5 (displaying 262,076 \u201cBEV\u201d out of 1,581,844 \nannual light-duty sales when 2022 filter is selected). \n\n \n22 \n \nanticipated) had profound consequences for automak-\ners\u2019 compliance with the Advanced Clean Cars I stand-\nards.  Because battery-electric vehicles can travel \nlonger distances without emitting tailpipe pollutants, \nthey yield the most \u201cZEV credits\u201d for purposes of the \nstandards.  See supra p. 6.  So the fact that 16% of \nlight-duty sales were battery-electric vehicles in 2022 \nyielded a ZEV credit percentage for that year that was \nfar above the highest requirement that the standards \nwould ever impose.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \n\u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2012) (22% ZEV credit requirement \nstarting in model year 2025).  And sales in California \nin 2022 were also exceeding the most stringent re-\nquirements of the fleetwide greenhouse-gas stand-\nards, even for future years, because the battery-\nelectric vehicles also have far lower emissions than \nplug-in hybrids.  See J.A. 7. \nBy May 2022, nine years after EPA first granted a \nwaiver for the Advanced Clean Cars I standards, there \nwas substantial reason to believe that automakers \nwould exceed the standards for their own reasons even \nwithout the reinstatement.  The court of appeals could \nnot \u201cpresume[]\u201d that petitioners\u2019 challenge was re-\ndressable.  Kokkonen, 511 U.S. at 377.  Nor could it \nassume redressability based on petitioners\u2019 \u201cuna-\ndorned speculation.\u201d  Simon v. E. Ky. Welfare Rts. \nOrg., 426 U.S. 26, 44 (1976).  Article III required the \ncourt to ask whether petitioners had \u201cmet their bur-\nden\u201d by introducing evidence demonstrating that au-\ntomakers would \u201clikely react\u201d to a vacatur of the 2022 \nreinstatement in ways that would increase demand for \npetitioners\u2019 products and services.  Dep\u2019t of Com. v. \nNew York, 588 U.S. 752, 768 (2019).   \n\n \n23 \n \nC. Petitioners Did Not Introduce Evidence \nEstablishing Redressability \nPetitioners did not carry their evidentiary burden.  \nIndeed, they submitted virtually no argument or evi-\ndence bearing on the likely effect of a vacatur on the \nmarket as it existed in 2022.   \n1.  Petitioners\u2019 opening brief in the court of appeals \ndevoted one sentence to redressability.  They asserted \nthat their \u201cinjury is caused by the challenged regula-\ntory action, and this Court can redress that injury by \nsetting aside the action.\u201d  J.A. 118.  That single con-\nclusory statement was not supported by any citation \nto evidence in the administrative record or elsewhere.  \nPetitioners attached 14 standing declarations to their \nopening brief.  See J.A. 120-184.  But none of those \ndeclarations was sufficient to carry their burden. \nThe bulk of each declaration described the declar-\nant\u2019s asserted injuries, with details supporting the \n(undisputed) proposition that petitioners and their \nmembers profit from fuel sales.  The declarants had \nalmost nothing to say about the critical question going \nto causation and redressability, which \u201care often \u2018flip \nsides of the same coin.\u2019\u201d  All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 \nU.S. at 380.  That question was whether, in 2022, the \nreinstatement of the waiver or the vacatur of that re-\ninstatement would affect automakers\u2019 choices in a \nmanner leading to changes in fuel sales.   \nOf the declarants who addressed causation, some \nasserted their \u201cunderstand[ing] that California\u2019s \ngreenhouse-gas standards and zero-emission-vehicle \nmandate reduce the demand for fuel in California.\u201d  \nJ.A. 125, 140, 169, 183; see also J.A. 176.  Those asser-\ntions were not accompanied by supporting facts or any \ndiscussion of the circumstances in 2022.  Other declar-\nants invoked statements from California about how \n\n \n24 \n \nthe standards would reduce demand for liquid fuels.  \nId. at 129, 136-137, 148, 153, 157, 166, 173, 180.  Peti-\ntioners now describe those statements as \u201crecent[] \nproject[ions] that the waiver would \u2018reduce emissions \nthrough reductions in fuel production.\u2019\u201d  Pet. Br. 38 \n(citing J.A. 148, 180).  But the projections are not \u201cre-\ncent\u201d at all.  They are from California\u2019s \u201c2012 Waiver \nRequest\u201d\u2014and state rulemaking documents submit-\nted as part of that request\u2014prepared a decade before \nthe challenged reinstatement and petitioners\u2019 suit.  \nJ.A. 148, 180; see also id. at 180 (citing state estimates \nfrom 2011).  Those outdated sources did not establish \nthat any reduced fuel sales in 2022 were caused by the \nwaiver\u2019s reinstatement instead of the dramatic \nchanges in the market and consumer demand that \npredated the reinstatement.14  \nThe declarants who addressed redressability did so \nin a single boilerplate sentence asserting that petition-\ners\u2019 \u201cinjuries would be substantially ameliorated if \nEPA\u2019s decision were set aside.\u201d  J.A. 130, 137, 150, \n154, 158, 167, 181; see Pet. App. 21a-22a.  Again, not \none of the declarants addressed the state of the market \nin 2022, when petitioners filed their suit.  Nor did they \nsay a word about automakers\u2019 behavior at that time, \nor the economic and other considerations that would \nshape automakers\u2019 response to a judicial vacatur.  See \ngenerally Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Env\u2019t \nServs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 201 (2000) (Scalia, J., \ndissenting) (discussing this Court\u2019s \u201crefus[al] to find \n \n14 One declarant also referenced a 2020 report by a Minnesota \nagency.

And petition-\ners\u2019 submission on reply neglected their duty to \u201csup-\nport their allegations by competent proof,\u201d once \n\u201cchallenged on allegations of jurisdictional facts.\u201d  \nHertz Corp., 559 U.S. at 96-97.   \n2.  Article III demanded more.  This Court has re-\npeatedly rejected theories of redressability that de-\npend on \u201c\u2018guesswork as to how independent \ndecisionmakers will exercise their judgment\u2019\u201d instead \nof concrete evidence submitted by the party seeking to \ninvoke federal jurisdiction.  Murthy, 603 U.S. at 57; \nsee, e.g., id. at 73-74; Haaland v. Brackeen, 599 U.S. \n255, 293-294 (2023); Lujan, 504 U.S. at 568-571 (plu-\nrality opinion); Simon, 426 U.S. at 42-43.  \u201cA federal \ncourt cannot ignore\u201d a party\u2019s failure to establish re-\ndressability \u201cwithout overstepping its assigned role in \nour system of adjudicating only actual cases and con-\ntroversies.\u201d  Simon, 426 U.S. at 39.  Because petition-\ners did not provide the court of appeals with any facts \nshowing a likelihood that vacating EPA\u2019s 2022 rein-\nstatement would redress their asserted injuries, the \ncourt properly held that it lacked jurisdiction to decide \nthe merits.  Pet. App. 30a. \n \n15 See generally Nat\u2019l Council for Adoption v. Blinken, 4 F.4th \n106, 111-112 (D.C. Cir. 2021) (discussing when standing evidence \nmay be introduced on reply).   \n\n \n27 \n \nNo one can doubt petitioners\u2019 desire to obtain an \nimmediate and definitive judicial resolution of their \nmerits theories.  See Pet. 26-27.  But the requirements \nof Article III often \u201cmean[] that the federal courts de-\ncide some contested legal questions later rather than \nsooner.\u201d  All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 380.  \nThe court of appeals properly adhered to those re-\nquirements here, refusing to reach the merits after pe-\ntitioners forewent any genuine effort to introduce facts \nestablishing a likelihood that vacatur of the 2022 re-\ninstatement would increase demand for their prod-\nucts. \nII. PETITIONERS IDENTIFY NO VALID BASIS FOR RE-\nVERSAL \nHaving failed \u201cto \u2018cit[e] any record evidence\u2019 or to \nfile \u2018additional affidavits or other evidence sufficient to \nsupport\u2019 redressability\u201d in the court below, Pet. App. \n24a-25a, petitioners now ask this Court to hold that \nthey did \u201cnot need to supply additional record evi-\ndence,\u201d Pet. Br. 17.  They advance three theories:  \n(i) that the Court should \u201cadopt [a] categorical rule\u201d \nthat this type of government action \u201calone suffices to \nestablish redressability,\u201d id. at 17, 18; (ii) that redress-\nability follows from the purported \u201cpredictable effects\u201d \nof the 2022 reinstatement on automakers, id. at 18; \nand (iii) that the duration of the challenged waiver, by \nitself, establishes redressability, see id. at 19, 45-47.  \nBut this Court\u2019s precedent forecloses those theories.  \nAnd petitioners\u2019 attempt to argue, in the alternative, \nthat the record contains \u201cplenty [of] evidence\u201d support-\ning redressability (id. at 37) ignores the gulf between \nthe referenced evidence and the question that mat-\ntered:  how automakers would likely have responded \nto a decision vacating the waiver in May 2022.   \n\n \n28 \n \nA. Government Regulations Implicating the \nUse of a Product Do Not Categorically Es-\ntablish Standing for Producers to Sue \nPetitioners first propose a categorical rule that re-\ndressability is automatically established in every chal-\nlenge seeking to \u201cremove a regulatory impediment to \nthe use of petitioners\u2019 products.\u201d  Pet. Br. 17.  They \nnever clarify the scope of the word \u201cimpediment.\u201d  But \nit appears that their rule would cover a flat prohibition \non the use of a product as well as any lesser restriction \nthat allegedly affects or implicates its use.  And the \nrule would apply even where (as here) the record con-\ntains evidence indicating that a favorable judgment \nwould not actually redress the asserted injury.  That \nnovel proposal finds no basis in this Court\u2019s precedent.  \nFor a court to conclude that it has jurisdiction, the \n\u201c\u2018specific facts\u2019\u201d matter\u2014as does the \u201cevidence\u201d sub-\nmitted by the parties.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561. \n1. Petitioners\u2019 proposed rule is at odds \nwith the precedent they invoke \nPetitioners point to Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154 \n(1997), as support for their proposed rule.  Pet. Br. 25-\n26.  That decision reiterated that an injury resulting \nfrom \u201cthe independent action of some third party not \nbefore the court\u201d is insufficient to establish Article III \nstanding.  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 169 (internal quotation \nmarks and emphasis omitted).  It also noted that the \nbar on standing for injuries caused by independent ac-\ntion does not \u201cexclude injury produced by determina-\ntive or coercive effect\u201d of a government action on the \nchoices of a third party.  Id.  Bennett thus confirms the \ncommon-sense proposition that a petitioner is not nec-\nessarily foreclosed from establishing redressability \njust because a third party is \u201cthe very last step in the \n\n \n29 \n \nchain of causation.\u201d  Id.; see also Lujan, 504 U.S. at \n562. \nBut Bennett hardly supports petitioners\u2019 sweeping \ntheory that redressability is automatically established \nwhenever a challenger simply asserts some \u201cregula-\ntory impediment\u201d (Pet. Br. 25) to the use of its product.  \nTo the contrary, the Court\u2019s decision underscores how \nmuch the particular facts of a case matter.  In Bennett, \nranchers and irrigation districts challenged a Fish and \nWildlife Service biological opinion that proposed min-\nimum water levels for a water project.  But a third \nparty (the Bureau of Reclamation) \u201cretain[ed] ulti-\nmate responsibility\u201d for deciding whether to adopt the \nproposal.  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 168.  With respect to \ncausation and redressability, the main question was \nwhether the Bureau would in fact feel constrained to \ndo what the Service suggested.   \nScrutinizing the facts before it, the Court deter-\nmined that\u2014\u201cin reality\u201d\u2014the biological opinion would \nhave a \u201cdeterminative or coercive effect\u201d on the Bu-\nreau\u2019s action.  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 169.  Although the \nopinion was theoretically advisory, the Service had \nacknowledged \u201cthe virtually determinative effect of its \nbiological opinions.\u201d  Id. at 170.  And the Solicitor Gen-\neral conceded that this particular opinion would have \n\u201ca powerful coercive effect\u201d on the Bureau.  Id. at 169.  \nBefore the opinion, the Bureau had operated the water \nproject \u201cin the same manner throughout the 20th cen-\ntury.\u201d  Id. at 170.  But the Bureau had notified the \nService that in the future it \u201cintended to act in accord-\nance with\u201d the recommendations in the Service\u2019s opin-\nion.16  Those facts showed that the opinion (not some \n \n16 Resp. Br., Bennett v. Spear, No. 95-813 (U.S.), 1996 WL 396714, \n(continued\u2026) \n\n \n30 \n \nother motivation) would cause the Bureau to alter its \nbehavior.  And they allowed the Court to hold that pe-\ntitioners\u2019 injury would \u201c\u2018likely\u2019 be redressed\u2014i.e., the \nBureau will not impose [the] water level restrictions\u2014\nif the Biological Opinion is set aside.\u201d  Bennett, 520 \nU.S. at 170-171.   \nThe other cases invoked by petitioners featured \nsimilar factual assessments.  In Pierce v. Society of the \nSisters of the Holy Names of Jesus & Mary, 268 U.S. \n510 (1925), the law prohibiting parents from sending \ntheir children to private schools had \u201ccaused the with-\ndrawal from [the plaintiff\u2019s] schools of children who \nwould otherwise continue.\u201d  Id. at 532 (emphasis \nadded).  In CBS, Inc. v. United States, 316 U.S. 407, \n414, 423 (1942), an affidavit from the plaintiff radio \nnetwork made clear that radio stations were in fact \n\u201ccancelling or threatening to cancel their contracts in \norder to conform to\u201d the challenged regulations.  And \nin Northeastern Florida Chapter of Associated General \nContractors v. City of Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656, 668 \n(1993), standing rested on petitioner\u2019s allegation that \nits members \u201cregularly bid on construction contracts\u201d \nand \u201cwould have bid on contracts\u201d unavailable to them \ndue to the challenged program \u201cwere they so able.\u201d  Be-\ncause those allegations \u201cha[d] not been challenged,\u201d \nthe Court \u201cassum[ed] that they [were] true.\u201d  Id. at \n668-669.17   \n \nat *27 n.14 (July 15, 1996); see also id. at *8; Bennett v. Plenert, \n1993 WL 669429, at *3 (D. Or. Nov. 18, 1993). \n17 Because of the nature of the equal protection right at issue in \nNortheastern Florida, the companies did not need to show that \nthird parties would have selected their bids\u2014just that the com-\npanies were unable to compete on an equal basis.  See, e.g., Gratz \nv. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 244, 262 (2003). \n\n \n31 \n \nNone of those cases supports a categorical rule ex-\ncusing anyone who sells a product from the obligation \nto establish redressability when challenging a regula-\ntion implicating the use of that product.  And the pos-\nture of cases like Bennett and CBS only underscores \nthe deficiency of petitioners\u2019 showing here.  The peti-\ntioners in those cases sought to survive a motion to \ndismiss, and therefore had the \u201crelatively modest\u201d \nburden of advancing \u201c\u2018general factual allegations\u2019\u201d on \nthe elements of standing.  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 168, \n171; see CBS, 316 U.S. at 414, 423; cf. Ne. Fla., 508 \nU.S. at 668-669.  Here, petitioners were seeking to ob-\ntain a final judgment.  So they needed to \u201c\u2018set forth\u2019 by \naffidavit or other evidence \u2018specific facts\u2019\u201d demonstrat-\ning that vacatur would likely redress their injury.  \nBennett, 520 U.S. at 168; see Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.  \nNo amount of after-the-fact theorizing can excuse \ntheir failure to do so.   \nFor similar reasons, Energy Future Coalition v. \nEPA, 793 F.3d 141 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (Kavanaugh, J.), \ndoes not establish standing here.  That case involved \nethanol producers who sought to challenge an EPA \nregulation prohibiting automakers from using fuel \ncontaining 30% ethanol when testing new vehicles.  Id. \nat 143-144.  The court of appeals observed that stand-\ning can be shown where judicial relief \u201cwould remove \na regulatory hurdle\u201d to the use of a petitioner\u2019s prod-\nuct.  Id. at 144; see Pet. Br. 4, 13, 28, 29, 36.  But that \nwas the starting point for the court\u2019s analysis\u2014not the \nfinish line.  Unlike the petitioners here, the challeng-\ners in Energy Future submitted a detailed standing \nanalysis, which included an economist\u2019s explanation of \nhow the regulated parties would react to the sought-\n\n \n32 \n \nafter change.18  The court was therefore able to focus \non actual record evidence establishing \u201csubstantial \nreason to think that at least some vehicle manufactur-\ners would use\u201d the fuel in testing if the challenged reg-\nulation were eliminated.  Energy Future, 793 F.3d at \n144; see also id. at 144 (describing comments from \nFord Motor Company).  And the court expressly dis-\ntinguished the case before it from a case (like this one) \nin which studies and other \u201cobjective evidence directly \nundermined petitioners\u2019 theory of standing.\u201d  Id. at \n145 n.2. \n2. Petitioners\u2019 rule would violate basic \nprinciples of Article III standing \nThat focus on the particular circumstances of the \ncase, and the allegations and evidence before the \ncourt, is compelled by core requirements of Article III. \na.  Federal courts may not exercise jurisdiction \nbased on assumptions or speculation.  See, e.g., Clap-\nper, 568 U.S. at 414; Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better \nEnv\u2019t, 523 U.S. 83, 94 (1998).  After the pleading stage, \nthey must assure themselves that standing exists by \nexamining \u201c\u2018specific facts\u2019\u201d and \u201cevidence\u201d introduced \nby the plaintiff.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561; see All. for \nHippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 384 (noting the \u201cheavily \nfact-dependent\u201d nature of the inquiry).  That obliga-\ntion takes on added significance when the circum-\nstances of a case (or evidence submitted by the \nopposing party) create serious doubts about one of the \nelements of standing.  See generally Hertz Corp., 559 \nU.S. at 96-97. \n \n18 See Pet. Br., Energy Future, No. 14-1123, 2014 WL 5035232, at \n*29-41 (D.C. Cir. Oct. 8, 2014). \n\n \n33 \n \nTo be sure, \u201cthe nature and extent of facts that \nmust be\u201d submitted by a party seeking to challenge \ngovernment action \u201cdepends considerably\u201d on the sur-\nrounding circumstances.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.  A \nplaintiff who is directly regulated by the challenged \naction, for example, may only need to submit evidence \nshowing that it is an object of that regulation, and that \nit would engage in activities proscribed by the regula-\ntion if it were allowed to do so.  Supra p. 16.  Similarly, \nif the action prohibits other companies from using the \nplaintiff\u2019s product, causation and redressability may \nfollow from basic evidence that the plaintiff sells the \nproduct and third-party companies would have used it \nabsent the regulation.  See, e.g., Energy Future, 793 \nF.3d at 144. \nBut observations about the ease of satisfying evi-\ndentiary requirements in certain types of cases do not \namount to a categorical legal rule that \u201csuffices to es-\ntablish redressability\u201d absent evidence.  Pet. Br. 17.  \nAs this Court has explained, presumptions run \nagainst jurisdiction\u2014not in favor of it.  See, e.g., Renne \nv. Geary, 501 U.S. 312, 316 (1991) (\u201cWe presume that \nfederal courts lack jurisdiction unless the contrary ap-\npears affirmatively from the record.\u201d (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted)); see also Kokkonen, 511 U.S. at \n377.   \nA court must therefore examine the facts and evi-\ndence to determine whether\u2014\u201cin reality\u201d\u2014a judgment \naddressing a challenged government action would \nlikely redress a plaintiff\u2019s asserted injury.  Bennett, \n520 U.S. at 169.  For example, if a regulation makes it \nunlawful \u201cfor soda manufacturers to use sugar,\u201d En-\nergy Future, 793 F.3d at 144, a plaintiff may establish \nstanding by pointing to the regulation and introducing \n\n \n34 \n \nevidence that it sells sugar and that some sodas con-\ntain sugar.  But not every case will be that \u201csimple\u201d \n(Pet. Br. 47).  If the regulation instead made it unlaw-\nful only for soda manufacturers to sell more than 80% \nof their beverages with sugar, and the administrative \nrecord established that sugar-free sodas already rep-\nresented 30% of the market before the regulation, that \nplaintiff would have to do more to establish redressa-\nbility. \nAs discussed above, petitioners\u2019 case does not re-\nsemble the \u201csimple\u201d scenarios, primarily because no \none challenged EPA\u2019s initial decision to grant a waiver \nin 2013.  In the ensuing decade, automakers made \nenormous investments in zero-emission vehicles and \nconsumer tastes evolved.  By May 2022, it was not at \nall clear that the presence or absence of the Advanced \nClean Cars I standards would have a determinative or \ncoercive effect on the mix of cars sold by automakers.  \nSee supra pp. 20-22.  Market forces and internal goals \nwere pushing automakers to continue their shift to-\nward electric vehicles, regardless of California\u2019s regu-\nlations.  Pet. App. 24a n.8.  Those circumstances \ndemanded actual evidence showing redressability\u2014\nnot unsupported assertions about \u201ccommon sense and \nbasic economics.\u201d  Pet. Br. 30. \nb.  Petitioners\u2019 contrary arguments demonstrate a \nmisunderstanding of this Court\u2019s precedent.  It is true \n(Pet. Br. 27) that redressability involves \u201cthe relation-\nship between \u2018the judicial relief requested\u2019 and the \u2018in-\njury\u2019 suffered.\u201d  California v. Texas, 593 U.S. 659, 671 \n(2021).  But the necessary relationship is lacking \nwhere the plaintiff fails to prove that \u201cdepress[ed] \nmarket demand\u201d for its product in fact \u201cflows from\u201d \n(Pet. Br. 27) the challenged regulation, and that vaca-\ntur would likely lead to increased demand. \n\n \n35 \n \nPetitioners also contend that, \u201c[a]s far as redressa-\nbility is concerned, . . . Article III\u2019s demands are the \nsame whether the plaintiff is directly or indirectly reg-\nulated.\u201d  Pet. Br. 27.  Justice Scalia long ago rejected \nthat notion in an opinion for the Court.  When a plain-\ntiff is not the direct object of the government action it \nchallenges, \u201cstanding is not precluded, but it is ordi-\nnarily \u2018substantially more difficult\u2019 to establish.\u201d  \nLujan, 504 U.S. at 562.  That is because the plaintiff \nmust \u201cadduce facts\u201d creating a likelihood that the \nthird parties who are directly regulated will make \n\u201cchoices . . . in such manner as to produce causation \nand permit redressability of injury.\u201d  Id.  Petitioners \ndid not do so here. \n3. Petitioners\u2019 policy arguments do not \njustify their rule \nPetitioners eventually resort to a series of \u201cpolicy\u201d \narguments.  Pet. Br. 41; see id. at 41-45.  They first \nargue that the decision below effectively \u201crequire[s] \nthe endorsement of a directly regulated third party be-\nfore an indirectly regulated party can sue.\u201d  Id. at 38.  \nThat would be a problem, they contend, because di-\nrectly regulated entities often will be unwilling or un-\nable to assist indirectly affected challengers.  See id. \nat 42.  But the court of appeals did not require peti-\ntioners to \u201cprovid[e] affidavits from automakers\u201d as a \ncondition of standing.  Id. at 38.  The court\u2019s opinion \nshowed a willingness to consider a variety of other ma-\nterials (if identified by the parties), including com-\nments in the administrative record and public \nstatements from industry participants.  See Pet. App. \n23a-24a, 28a.   \nAnd there are a range of evidentiary sources be-\nyond \u201caffidavits from automakers\u201d that bear on how \nautomakers would likely respond to a vacatur in 2022.  \n\n \n36 \n \nThe state respondents gathered facts relevant to \nstanding from public databases, news articles, securi-\nties and court filings, government reports, and corpo-\nrate announcements.  See, e.g., J.A. 190-206.  Just a \nfew days after the oral argument caused petitioners to \ntake the jurisdictional questions seriously, petitioners \nlocated retired auto executives to file supplemental \ndeclarations that purported to speak authoritatively \nabout automakers\u2019 capabilities and practices.  See J.A. \n213, 218.19  In similar contexts, other litigants have \nrelied on a variety of sources.  See, e.g., C.A. Ohio Br. \nAdd. 37-54 (economist\u2019s declaration); Duke Pwr. Co. v. \nCarolina Envt\u2019l Study Grp., Inc., 438 U.S. 59, 75-76 \n(1978) (congressional testimony); Competitive Enter. \nInst. v. FCC, 970 F.3d 372, 383 (D.C. Cir. 2020) (ex-\npert\u2019s analysis); Competitive Enter. Inst. v. NHTSA, \n901 F.2d 107, 117 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (testimony from ad-\nministrative hearing).   \nThe decision below thus does not \u201ccreat[e] artifi-\ncially high evidentiary barriers.\u201d  Pet. Br. 35.  And it \ndoes not obstruct \u201csuits by unregulated plaintiffs who \nare adversely affected by an agency\u2019s regulation of oth-\ners.\u201d  Corner Post, Inc. v. Bd. of Governors of Fed. Rsrv. \nSys., 603 U.S. 799, 826 (2024) (Kavanaugh, J., concur-\nring).  It simply ensures that any such suits are \n \n19 Those declarations are not before this Court because the court \nof appeals held that petitioners failed to establish good cause for \ntheir untimely filing, see Pet. App. 31a-32a, and petitioners did \nnot seek review of that ruling, see Pet. I; State Opp. 14-15.  In any \nevent, the declarants did not account for 2022 market conditions.  \nSee J.A. 213-222.  As to redressability, they merely asserted that \nautomakers \u201clikely would change their production, pricing, \nand/or distribution plans for Model Year 2025\u201d absent Califor-\nnia\u2019s standards.  J.A. 215, 220.  They offered no supporting de-\ntails, and focused instead on the distinct question of how quickly \nautomakers could change their fleets and prices. \n\n \n37 \n \nbrought by plaintiffs who are, in fact, adversely af-\nfected by the challenged action and would benefit from \na favorable decision.     \nNext, petitioners argue that the \u201cdecision below \ncreates troubling incentives for agencies.\u201d  Pet. Br. 43.  \nThey assert that agencies may now \u201ctarget entire in-\ndustries with crippling burdens so long as they act \nthrough a conduit and placate that conduit.\u201d  Id.20  \nAgain, however, a plaintiff whose sales are crippled as \nthe result of an agency action can invoke numerous \nsources to demonstrate a likelihood that vacatur \nwould increase sales.  Nor does this case present any \nvalid concern about \u201cencourag[ing] agencies to act over \nshorter time horizons.\u201d  Pet. Br. 44.  The underlying \nwaiver was granted in 2013 and addressed standards \nthat increased in stringency through model year 2025.  \nAny jurisdictional difficulties petitioners confronted \nresulted primarily from their own choice not to chal-\nlenge the original 2013 action.  See supra p. 18 n.7. \nFinally, petitioners argue that the court of appeals \n\u201ccreate[d] a one-way ratchet in favor of the regulator \nover the regulated\u201d by requiring petitioners to intro-\nduce evidence of standing.  Pet. Br. 44.  They contrast \nthat requirement with the principle that \u201c[a] State will \n \n20 Petitioners note that several automakers entered voluntary \nagreements with California in 2020 to continue producing more \nlow- and zero-emission vehicles.  See Pet. App. 13a-14a.  But that \nwas not a \u201ctroubling\u201d effort by EPA to \u201cinsulate\u201d the \u201centire in-\ndustr[y]\u201d from \u201creview.\u201d  Pet. Br. 43.  And petitioners \nacknowledge that \u201cmany\u201d other automakers did not enter any \nsuch agreement.  Id. at 37.  Nothing prevented petitioners from \nattempting to introduce evidence showing that the non-partici-\npating automakers would likely change their fleets in response to \na vacatur of the reinstatement. \n\n \n38 \n \nalways have \u2018a legitimate interest in the continued en-\nforceability of its own statutes.\u2019\u201d  Id. (quoting Maine v. \nTaylor, 477 U.S. 131, 137 (1986)).  But state plaintiffs \ndo introduce evidence where necessary to show that a \nfavorable judgment would redress their injuries.  See, \ne.g., Dep\u2019t of Com., 588 U.S. at 767-768.  And this \nCourt\u2019s recognition that sovereigns have a protectable \ninterest in effectuating their own statutes hardly \namounts to \u201cbad policy.\u201d  Pet. Br. 41; see Maryland v. \nKing, 567 U.S. 1301, 1303 (2012) (Roberts, C.J., in \nchambers); Maine, 477 U.S. at 137. \nThe more relevant policy consideration is the one \nunderlying Article III:  that federal courts have lim-\nited jurisdiction, and a party seeking to invoke that \njurisdiction must show that its claim falls within those \nlimits.  That policy, which reflects the Framers\u2019 vision \nof the proper role of courts in our democratic system, \nsee All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 380, requires \naffirmance here.   \nB. Unsupported Predictions About the Effect \nof a Judgment on a Third Party Are Insuf-\nficient to Establish Redressability \nPetitioners\u2019 alternative theory for why they did not \nneed to introduce evidence of redressability fails for \nsimilar reasons.  They contend that plaintiffs can es-\ntablish standing simply by asserting that the \u201ceffects \nof the challenged government action on third parties\u201d \nare \u201cpredictable\u201d\u2014and that \u201cno more is needed.\u201d  Pet. \nBr. 18.  The cases petitioners invoke for that argument \nactually demonstrate the opposite.   \nPetitioners portray Department of Commerce as \nholding that unsupported inferences and predictions \nabout \u201cthird-party behavior . . . can suffice\u201d to estab-\nlish standing.  Pet. Br. 30; see id. at 31.  In truth, that \ndecision examined whether the plaintiffs \u201cha[d] met \n\n \n39 \n \ntheir burden of showing that third parties will likely \nreact in predictable ways\u201d to a citizenship question on \nthe 2020 census, and thereby cause harm to the plain-\ntiffs.  Dep\u2019t of Com., 588 U.S. at 768 (emphasis added).  \nThe Court answered that question in the affirmative \nonly after reviewing the district court\u2019s \u201cfindings of \nfact\u201d\u2014based on extensive \u201cevidence\u201d\u2014which \u201cestab-\nlished a sufficient likelihood that the reinstatement of \na citizenship question\u201d would depress census response \nrates.  Id. at 767; see New York v. Dep\u2019t of Com., 351 F. \nSupp. 3d 502, 578-581 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (describing ex-\npert testimony, statistical data, and agency memo-\nranda).  The Court did not rely on \u201cspeculation\u201d or \npredictions alone.  Dep\u2019t of Com., 588 U.S. at 768.21 \nNor can petitioners dismiss the significance of the \nevidence before the Court in Department of Commerce \non the ground that it merely recounted \u201chistorical \npractice.\u201d  Pet. Br. 31.  The plaintiffs in that case did \nnot just reference the result of questions on prior cen-\nsuses.  They introduced detailed evidence that \u201cover-\nwhelmingly support[ed] the conclusion that the \naddition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census \nwill cause a significant net differential decline in self-\nresponse rates among noncitizen households.\u201d  New \nYork, 351 F. Supp. 3d at 578 (emphasis added). \nThe remaining authorities discussed by petitioners \n(Pet. Br. 31) do not advance their theory either.  The \nstanding analysis in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. \n497, 526 (2007), turned on evidence that included \u201cpe-\ntitioners\u2019 uncontested affidavits.\u201d  That evidence \n \n21 See also California, 593 U.S. at 678 (explaining that the plain-\ntiffs in Department of Commerce \u201crelied not only on \u2018the predict-\nable effect of Government action on the decisions of third parties\u2019 \nbut also on comprehensive studies, rather than mere \u2018specula-\ntion\u2019\u201d). \n\n \n40 \n \nshowed that \u201cthe United States transportation sector \nemit[ted] . . .  more than 6% of worldwide carbon diox-\nide emissions,\u201d id. at 524; that there was \u201ca causal con-\nnection between manmade greenhouse gas emissions \nand global warming,\u201d id. at 523, see id. at 525; and \nthat \u201c[a] reduction in domestic emissions\u201d resulting \nfrom the requested relief \u201cwould slow the pace of \nglobal emissions increases,\u201d providing partial redress \nfor petitioners\u2019 undisputed injuries, id. at 526; see id. \nat 522-523.22  In Skyline Wesleyan Church v. Califor-\nnia Department of Managed Health Care, 968 F.3d \n738, 750 (9th Cir. 2020), the plaintiff similarly offered \n\u201cevidence\u201d that regulatory enforcement had caused \nhealth insurers to abandon restrictions on abortion \ncoverage.  Specifically, \u201cseven insurers had offered \nplans with abortion coverage restrictions\u201d consistent \nwith plaintiff\u2019s religious beliefs, then \u201call seven com-\nplied\u201d with a regulator\u2019s warning to stop offering such \nplans.  Id. at 750.  Both decisions thus turned on ac-\ntual evidence, not unsupported predictions. \nPetitioners nonetheless advance a blanket rule \nthat no evidence is required if \u201cthe behavior of third \nparties is predictable rather than speculative.\u201d  Pet. \nBr. 30.  They further contend that only \u201cthree \ncircumstances\u201d exist in which third-party behavior is \nsufficiently speculative to require evidence of redress-\nability:  (i) where a plaintiff\u2019s theory relies on \u201c\u2018coun-\nterintuitive\u2019 assumptions,\u201d  id. at 32 (citing California, \n593 U.S. at 678); (ii) where it relies on an attenuated \n\u201cchain of events,\u201d Pet. Br. 32 (citing All. for Hippo-\ncratic Med., 602 U.S. at 386); and (iii) where the \u201clegal \nimpact of a judicial decision is unclear,\u201d Pet. Br. 33 \n \n22 The Court also accorded a \u201cspecial solicitude\u201d to the state peti-\ntioners, which does not apply to the private petitioners here.  \nMassachusetts, 549 U.S. at 520. \n\n \n41 \n \n(citing Murthy, 603 U.S. at 72-73, Brackeen, 599 U.S. \nat 294, and Texas, 599 U.S. at 691 (Gorsuch, J., con-\ncurring in the judgment)). \nThose arguments profoundly misunderstand this \nCourt\u2019s standing doctrine.  Challengers must always \nidentify \u201cevidence\u201d proving \u201c\u2018specific facts\u2019\u201d that estab-\nlish standing.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561; see FW/PBS, \nInc. v. City of Dallas, 493 U.S. 215, 231 (1990).  And \nthis Court\u2019s analysis of standing is \u201cnot a \u2018mechanical \nexercise\u2019\u201d\u2014particularly when it comes to suits (like \nthis one) \u201cby unregulated parties against the govern-\nment.\u201d  All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 384.  In \nsome cases, \u201cfamiliar circumstances\u201d make standing \n\u201clikely,\u201d id., and a plaintiff might be able to meet its \nburden with less evidence.  In other cases, like those \nreferenced by petitioners, the Court has pointed to cir-\ncumstances calling for \u201cfar stronger evidence\u201d of cau-\nsation and redressability.  E.g., California, 593 U.S. at \n678.  But those circumstances are not the only ones in \nwhich plaintiffs are required to introduce any evi-\ndence.  \nPetitioners\u2019 own arguments illustrate the folly of \ntheir proposed rule.  Invoking Summers v. Earth Is-\nland Institute, 555 U.S. 488, 494 (2009), petitioners ar-\ngue (Pet. Br. 34) that \u201cit is predictable that when the \ngovernment \u2018regulates parks, national forests, or bod-\nies of water,\u2019 it will affect the users of those natural \nresources.\u201d  \u201cIn all such cases,\u201d id., petitioners assert, \nno \u201c[r]ecord evidence is required,\u201d id. at 30.  But Sum-\nmers held exactly the opposite.  It reiterated that a \nplaintiff \u201cbears the burden of showing that he has \nstanding.\u201d  Summers, 555 U.S. at 493.  The Court in-\nsisted on particular evidence showing that the chal-\nlenged regulations would affect a specific site that at \nleast one of plaintiffs\u2019 members had \u201ca specific and \n\n \n42 \n \nconcrete plan\u201d to visit.  Id. at 495.  And it rejected a \n\u201chitherto unheard-of test\u201d that would premise stand-\ning on a \u201cprobability\u201d that \u201csome (unidentified) mem-\nbers have planned to visit some (unidentified) small \nparcels affected by the Forest Service\u2019s procedures and \nwill suffer (unidentified) concrete harm as a result.\u201d  \nId. at 497-498.  That sort of predictive approach\u2014un-\nsupported by concrete evidence\u2014would \u201cmake a mock-\nery of\u201d the Court\u2019s \u201cprior cases.\u201d  Id. at 498. \nC. The Duration of the Waiver Does Not, By \nItself, Establish Standing \nPetitioners also contend that they were excused \nfrom submitting evidence because the \u201cwaiver for cer-\ntain California standards does not sunset.\u201d  Pet. Br. \n19.  But the fact that the greenhouse-gas standards \nplateau starting in model year 2025, and continue at \nthe same levels in future years, supra p. 6, does not \nchange the analysis.   \n1.  Petitioners reason that because those standards \n\u201cdo not expire,\u201d a judicial vacatur \u201cwould necessarily \nhave some effect on vehicle pricing, production, or dis-\ntribution at some future point.\u201d  Pet. Br. 46 (emphasis \nadded).  This Court has previously rejected that kind \nof reasoning.  See Summers, 555 U.S. at 496 (state-\nments of \u201c\u2018some day\u2019 intentions,\u201d without \u201cany specifi-\ncation of when the some day will be,\u201d are insufficient \nto establish standing); Lujan, 504 U.S. at 564 (same).  \nAnd for good reason.  Statutes and regulations often \ndo not sunset.  The mere longevity of a challenged reg-\nulation is no substitute for \u201cspecific, concrete facts \ndemonstrating that\u201d the plaintiff is harmed by the \ngovernment\u2019s action and \u201cpersonally would benefit in \na tangible way from the court\u2019s intervention.\u201d  Warth, \n422 U.S. at 508. \n\n \n43 \n \nIn this case, moreover, the facts belie petitioners\u2019 \nassertion (Pet. Br. 19) that the duration of the green-\nhouse-gas standards eliminates any \u201cplausible dis-\npute\u201d about redressability.  By the time of this suit, \nsales of battery-electric vehicles far exceeded original \nforecasts, and those vehicles generate an outsized \nnumber of ZEV credits and produce very few green-\nhouse-gas emissions.  See supra pp. 6, 21-22.  Petition-\ners did not submit any evidence that the market would \nreverse course if those standards were no longer in \nplace in future years.  See supra p. 25. \nNor does the court of appeals\u2019 apparent misunder-\nstanding about the temporal scope of the greenhouse-\ngas standards (Pet. Br. 45) compel a different outcome.  \nThe court of appeals lacked jurisdiction because peti-\ntioners failed to introduce evidence showing that au-\ntomakers would likely respond to vacatur by \u201cselling \nfewer non-conventional vehicles or by altering the \nprices of their vehicles such that fewer non-conven-\ntional vehicles\u2014and more conventional vehicles\u2014\nwere sold.\u201d  Pet. App. 22a; see id. at 29a-30a.  The \ncourt\u2019s belief that the challenge before it \u201cconcern[ed] \nonly\u201d the reinstatement of the waiver \u201cas to Model \nYears 2017 through 2025,\u201d was a consideration that \n\u201cfurther complicated\u201d the redressability analysis.  Id. \nat 22a (emphasis added); see id. at 24a.  Setting aside \nthat additional perceived complication does not make \nup for petitioners\u2019 failure to introduce any evidence ad-\ndressing how automakers would likely respond to a \nvacatur in May 2022.  See U.S. Opp. 12-14. \n2.  Relatedly, petitioners fault EPA and the court \nof appeals for the court\u2019s \u201cincorrect\u201d premise about the \nduration of the waiver, Pet. Br. 45, which they contend \ncaused the court to improperly \u201cconflate[] mootness \n\n \n44 \n \nand redressability,\u201d id. at 39.  Those arguments are \npuzzling. \nIt has never been a secret that California\u2019s \u201cgreen-\nhouse-gas emission standards applied to model year \n2025 \u2018and subsequent.\u2019\u201d  Pet. Br. 45-46 (quoting J.A. \n50).  That was plainly described in the California Code \nof Regulations. See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \n\u00a7 1961.3(a)(1)(A); see also Cal. Code Regs., tit. 13, \n\u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2012) (similar wording in originally \nenacted ZEV provision).  Petitioners imply that the \nlower court\u2019s confusion about the duration of the \nwaiver arose because EPA failed to \u201ccandidly ex-\nplain[]\u201d the matter until the certiorari stage.  Pet. Br. \n45; see id. at 46.  But the more likely culprit was peti-\ntioners\u2019 opening brief below, which told the court that \npetitioners were challenging a program \u201ccover[ing] ve-\nhicles from model years 2015 through 2025.\u201d  C.A. Pri-\nvate Pet. Br. 9; see also C.A. Oral Arg. 33:55-34:13 \n(argument of petitioners\u2019 counsel that, to defeat stand-\ning, \u201cthe Government would need to come forward \nwith some evidence that [automakers have] now \nplanned around the restatement in a way that couldn\u2019t \nbe withdrawn by 2025\u201d). \nThe lack of clarity on this point was perhaps un-\nderstandable:  petitioners\u2019 central focus in this case \nhas always been on the ZEV standards, which will ex-\npire after model year 2025.  Pet. Br. 46.  That may be \nwhy petitioners urged this Court to resolve the merits \nof their statutory claim before \u201cCalifornia\u2019s waiver ex-\npires at the end of model year 2025,\u201d Pet. 26, even af-\nter they had belatedly acknowledged that the \ngreenhouse-gas standards apply to \u201cModel Years \n\u20182025 and subsequent,\u2019\u201d C.A. Private Pet. Proposed \nSupp. Br. 5.  But whatever the source of the confusion \n\n \n45 \n \nbelow, it did not matter to the ultimate outcome.  Re-\ngardless of the waiver\u2019s duration, petitioners failed to \nshow that automakers would respond to its reinstate-\nment (either sooner or later) by making changes that \nwould increase fuel sales.   \nIn the face of that failure, the court of appeals cor-\nrectly explained why its decision was based on stand-\ning, not mootness:  The jurisdictional problem was not \nthat petitioners\u2019 \u201cstanding arguments were sufficient \nwhen originally filed\u201d and then were \u201cmooted by the \npassage of time.\u201d  Pet. App. 25a; see generally Already, \nLLC v. Nike, Inc., 568 U.S. 85, 91 (2013).  Petitioners\u2019 \n\u201cstanding arguments were deficient from the start.\u201d  \nPet. App. 25a.  By the time petitioners filed their chal-\nlenge in May 2022, shifts in consumer demand and \nother transformations in the market made it specula-\ntive (at best) that vacating the reinstatement would \nlead to increased fuel sales in the future.  Petitioners \nnever even attempted to introduce evidence demon-\nstrating that vacatur of the reinstatement would have \nthe effects on automakers that they predicted.  Pet. \nApp. 29a-30a.   \nD. Petitioners\u2019 Post Hoc Attempts to Identify \nEvidence on Redressability Fail to Estab-\nlish Standing \nFinally, petitioners argue that if they \u201cwere legally \nrequired to produce record evidence to support re-\ndressability, plenty such evidence existed.\u201d  Pet. \nBr. 37.  But the few documents that petitioners cited \nin the court of appeals did not establish any likelihood \nthat a vacatur in 2022 would increase fuel sales, as \ndetailed in Part I.C above.  And the additional materi-\nals petitioners now point this Court to would not have \nestablished redressability even if petitioners had in-\nvoked them in a timely fashion below. \n\n \n46 \n \nPetitioners first highlight (Pet. Br. 38) a statement \nfrom an appendix to California\u2019s 2021 comment letter \nregarding the reinstatement.  See J.A. 84.  But that \nstatement relied on forecasts from 2017.  See J.A. 85 \nn.17 (citing January 2017 analysis of regulation com-\npliance scenarios); id. at 85 n.18 (citing February 2017 \nmodeling scenario).  By 2022, the earlier projections \nhad been overtaken by actual events.  See J.A. 191 (na-\ntional market share of zero-emission vehicles \u201calmost \ntripled\u201d in the period \u201cbetween 2020 and the third \nquarter of 2022\u201d). \nPetitioners also invoke declarations that the state \nrespondents filed along with their motion to intervene, \nshortly after petitioners initiated this suit.  See Pet. \nBr. 13, 34.  Those declarations (like petitioners\u2019) as-\nserted a conclusory \u201cexpect[ation]\u201d that additional \ngasoline-fueled vehicles would be sold if California\u2019s \nstandards were not in place.  J.A. 110, 111; see id. at \n115-116.  The lack of any details or contemporaneous \nevidence for those assertions reflected both time con-\nstraints (the intervention declarations were signed \nfour days after the case commenced) and the reality \nthat the States\u2019 standing and entitlement to intervene \nwere independently established for other reasons.  Cf. \nKing, 567 U.S. at 1303 (reasoning that a State suffers \n\u201congoing irreparable harm\u201d any time it \u201cis enjoined by \na court from effectuating . . . a duly enacted statute\u201d). \nAnother document referenced by petitioners (Pet. \nBr. 47) is outside the record and post-dates the deci-\nsion below:  EPA\u2019s recent request for public comment \non its proposal to incorporate the greenhouse-gas \nstandards of the Advanced Clean Cars I program into \nCalifornia\u2019s state implementation plan.  See 89 Fed. \nReg. 82,553 (Oct. 11, 2024); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7407.  To be \nsure, the underlying state estimates referenced in that \n\n \n47 \n \nproposal (see 89 Fed. Reg. at 82,557 & nn.19-20) are \npart of the record, because California submitted them \nto EPA in 2021 in connection with the reinstatement \nproceedings.  See C.A. J.A. 276.  But petitioners never \ninvoked those submissions below.  And the estimates \ntook as their baseline a projection of zero-emission ve-\nhicle penetration based on 2019 data, which did not \nanticipate the dramatic increase in sales in the follow-\ning years.23   \nNone of the materials that petitioners belatedly \nreference could have satisfied their burden to submit \nevidence about how the market would respond to va-\ncatur of the reinstatement in May 2022.  And the fact \nthat they were not \u201cset forth\u201d as \u201cthe basis for the \nclaim of standing\u201d below poses another insuperable \nobstacle for petitioners.  D.C. Cir. R. 28(a)(7).  As this \nCourt recently reminded litigants, \u201c\u2018judges are not like \npigs, hunting for truffles buried in the record.\u2019\u201d  \nMurthy, 603 U.S. at 67 n.7 (alterations omitted).  The \ncourt of appeals could not reasonably be expected to \nfocus on a few sentences scattered across thousands of \npages of record materials, which were never raised in \npetitioners\u2019 briefs.  Nor could it be expected to recall \nisolated assertions in two declarations, filed in support \nof one of five unopposed motions to intervene, that \nwere disposed of by the Clerk more than a year before \noral argument.  See C.A. Order (June 30, 2022). \nIn the end, petitioners are right that this case is \n\u201csimple\u201d (Pet. Br. 47)\u2014but not in the way they sug-\ngest.  They had the burden to introduce evidence es-\ntablishing that their claim was redressable.  Instead \n \n23  See C.A. J.A. 277 (explaining reliance on \u201cEMFAC 2021\u201d \nmodel); Cal. Air Res. Bd., EMFAC 2021 Volume III Technical \nDocument, at 6 (April 2021), https://tinyurl.com/2wsxz4uy (ex-\nplaining use of DMV data through 2019). \n\n \n48 \n \nof meeting that obligation head-on, they treated re-\ndressability as an afterthought\u2014relying on assump-\ntions and conclusory assertions, supplemented only by \noutdated projections.  And when confronted with cur-\nrent evidence from the state respondents undermining \ntheir assumption that vacatur of the reinstatement in \nMay 2022 would lead to increased fuel sales, petition-\ners offered no evidentiary response.  Because petition-\ners failed to introduce specific facts and evidence \nestablishing a likelihood of redressability, the court of \nappeals properly held that it could not reach the mer-\nits. \n\n \n49 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be af-\nfirmed. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \nROB BONTA \nAttorney General of California \nMICHAEL J.

As their case progresses, they \nmust \u201cpoint to factual evidence\u201d establishing that they \nsatisfied the three elements of standing\u2014injury, cau-\nsation, and redressability\u2014as of the time they filed \nsuit.  Murthy v. Missouri, 603 U.S. 43, 57-58 (2024).  \nThe only question here is how to apply those long-set-\ntled requirements to the peculiar circumstances of this \ncase, involving a waiver of preemption under Section \n209(b) of the Clean Air Act. \nAs petitioners describe things, that question is \n\u201cstraightforward\u201d because standing is automatic here.  \nPet. Br. 35.  Petitioners profit from sales of fuel.  They \nnote that the waiver allowed California to impose \nstate standards limiting greenhouse-gas emissions \nacross automakers\u2019 fleets and requiring automakers to \nsell a certain percentage of zero-emission vehicles.  Pe-\ntitioners assert that \u201c[t]hey promptly challenged \nEPA\u2019s waiver,\u201d id. at 20; that the waiver injures peti-\ntioners and their members by \u201creduc[ing] the use of \nliquid fuel,\u201d id.; and that \u201c[s]etting aside EPA\u2019s waiver \nwould . . . end[] the artificial depression of demand for \npetitioners\u2019 products,\u201d id. at 20-21.  Standing was so \n\u201cobvious,\u201d in their view, that they did not \u201cneed to sup-\nply additional record evidence\u201d to establish redressa-\nbility.  Id. at 17, 18. \nBut \u201capplying the law of standing\u201d frequently de-\nmands a \u201cheavily fact-dependent\u201d inquiry, FDA v. All. \nfor Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 384 (2024), and pe-\ntitioners elide the most salient facts in this case.  EPA \ngranted the relevant waiver in 2013.  Petitioners did \nnot challenge that waiver and neither did anyone else.  \nIt remained in effect for more than six years before \n\n \n2 \n \nEPA withdrew it in 2019.  During those six years, in \nresponse to the state standards and wider national \nand global trends, automakers invested heavily in \nchanging their fleets and building consumer demand \nfor electric vehicles.  Consumer preferences and the \nautomobile market evolved.  Even when EPA with-\ndrew the waiver, automakers accelerated their transi-\ntion to electric vehicles and consumer demand \ncontinued to grow. \nIn 2021, when EPA invited comment on whether to \nreinstate the waiver, the state respondents supported \nreinstatement.  As their comment explained, the with-\ndrawal had exceeded EPA\u2019s authority and it deprived \nCalifornia\u2019s regulations of legal effect.  But by the time \nEPA reinstated the waiver and petitioners challenged \nthat decision in 2022, \u201c\u2018both internal sustainability \ngoals and external market forces\u2019\u201d were pushing \n\u201cmanufacturers to transition toward electric vehicles, \nirrespective of California\u2019s regulations.\u201d  Pet. App. 24a \nn.8.  Indeed, publicly available evidence submitted by \nthe state respondents showed that zero-emission vehi-\ncles sold in California in 2022 already exceeded what \nthe relevant standards required.  Consumers were \nwilling to pay substantial price premiums for those ve-\nhicles.  And automakers had strong incentives to keep \nselling them. \nWhen the court of appeals confronted petitioners\u2019 \nchallenge to the reinstatement, it had to assure itself \nof jurisdiction by evaluating whether vacatur of that \nreinstatement would likely lead automakers to make \nchoices that would redress petitioners\u2019 asserted injury.  \nGiven the circumstances when petitioners filed suit in \nMay 2022, would automakers change their fleets or \nprices in a way that would increase demand for peti-\ntioners\u2019 liquid-fuel products?  Or would automakers \n\n \n3 \n \nexceed the requirements of California\u2019s standards for \ntheir own economic and strategic reasons, even with-\nout a legal requirement to do so?  Petitioners submit-\nted no evidence addressing that critical issue.  And \ngiven that absence of proof, the court of appeals \nproperly held that petitioners failed to meet their bur-\nden of demonstrating redressability. \nPetitioners ask this Court to excuse that failure.  \nThey first urge the Court to adopt a new \u201ccategorical \nrule.\u201d  Pet. Br. 4.  Under that rule, redressability \nwould be established automatically whenever peti-\ntioners challenge a regulation that implicates the use \nof their products\u2014even if the regulation applies only \nto third parties, and even where petitioners introduce \nno evidence indicating that those third parties would \nhave acted differently in the regulation\u2019s absence.  Id.  \nIn the alternative, petitioners ask the Court to credit \ntheir unsubstantiated predictions about how au-\ntomakers might respond to a vacatur.  Id. at 30-35.  \nThose arguments find no support in this Court\u2019s prec-\nedent.  Adopting them would effectively eliminate the \nplaintiff\u2019s \u201cburden of showing that third parties will \nlikely react\u201d to a favorable judgment in a way that pro-\nvides redress.  Dep\u2019t of Com. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, \n768 (2019).  And they would allow a court to assume \nredressability even if all the evidence before it indi-\ncates that a favorable judgment would not, in fact, re-\ndress the plaintiffs\u2019 injury.  This Court should reject \npetitioners\u2019 novel standing theories and affirm the \njudgment below. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal and Regulatory Background \n1.  The Clean Air Act directs EPA to prescribe fed-\neral standards governing emissions of air pollutants \n\n \n4 \n \nfrom new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle en-\ngines.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7521.  Section 209(a) of the Act gen-\nerally preempts States and their political subdivisions \nfrom \u201cadopt[ing] or attempt[ing] to enforce any stand-\nard relating to the control of emissions from new mo-\ntor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines.\u201d  Id. \n\u00a7 7543(a).  But Section 209(b) instructs EPA to \u201cwaive \napplication of [Section 209] to any State which ha[d] \nadopted\u201d qualifying emission standards \u201cprior to \nMarch 30, 1966, if the State determines that the State \nstandards will be, in the aggregate, at least as protec-\ntive of public health and welfare as applicable Federal \nstandards.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7543(b)(1).  If a State makes that de-\ntermination, EPA must waive preemption unless it \nmakes one of three enumerated findings.  See id. \n\u00a7 7543(b)(1)(A)-(C). \nCalifornia is the only State eligible for a waiver un-\nder Section 209(b) because it was the only State that \nhad developed qualifying motor vehicle emissions \nstandards before March 30, 1966.  Pet. App. 7a.  \u201cCon-\ngress recognized that California was already the \n\u2018lead[er] in the establishment of standards for regula-\ntion of automative pollutant emissions\u2019 at a time when \nthe federal government had yet to promulgate any reg-\nulations of its own.\u201d  Engine Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 88 \nF.3d 1075, 1079 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  Congress designed \nSection 209 to allow California to continue to serve as \na \u201c\u2018laboratory for innovation,\u2019\u201d id. at 1080, while also \n\u201cavoid[ing] the economic disruption\u201d that would come \nfrom manufacturers \u201chaving to meet fifty-one separate \nsets of emission control requirements,\u201d Motor & \nEquip. Mfrs. Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. EPA, 627 F.2d 1095, 1109 \n(D.C. Cir. 1979); see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7507 (1977 \namendment allowing other States to adopt standards \n\u201cidentical to the California standards for which a \nwaiver has been granted for such model year\u201d); Pet. \n\n \n5 \n \nApp. 9a n.3 (noting that \u201cseventeen states have chosen \nto adopt some portion of the California regulations\u201d). \nCalifornia received its first waiver in 1968 and has \nreceived additional waivers in every subsequent dec-\nade.1  For instance, EPA granted a waiver in 1993 for \nCalifornia\u2019s first Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) regula-\ntion, which required a specific percentage of light-duty \nvehicles to be zero-emission vehicles with no exhaust \nor evaporative emissions.  58 Fed. Reg. 4166 (Jan. 13, \n1993).2  EPA granted another waiver, in 2009, for Cal-\nifornia\u2019s first set of regulations to control greenhouse-\ngas emissions from motor vehicles.  74 Fed. Reg. \n32,744 (July 8, 2009). \n2.  This litigation concerns a set of emissions \nstandards that California adopted in 2012 as part of \nits Advanced Clean Cars I program.  78 Fed. Reg. 2112 \n(Jan. 9, 2013).  As relevant here, those standards in-\ncluded a requirement that automakers reduce the av-\nerage greenhouse-gas emissions across the fleets of \nvehicles they sell in California.  See id. at 2114.  They \nalso included new ZEV standards, requiring manufac-\nturers to meet specified \u201cZEV credit percentage\u201d re-\nquirements.  Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(b) \n(2012).   \nA manufacturer can satisfy the \u201cZEV credit per-\ncentage\u201d in several ways:  by generating credits from \nsales of qualifying vehicles, purchasing credits from \nother manufacturers, using excess credits banked in \nprior years, or applying credits obtained by overcom-\n \n1 See EPA, Vehicle Emissions California Waivers and Authoriza-\ntions, https://tinyurl.com/3rxscztw (last visited Mar. 6, 2025). \n2  See Cal. Air Res. Bd., Low-Emission Vehicle Program,  \nhttps://tinyurl.com/49m28yze (last visited Mar. 6, 2025). \n\n \n6 \n \nplying with the greenhouse-gas emission require-\nments.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(d)(5); 78 \nFed. Reg. at 2119-2120, 2135.  The number of ZEV \ncredits generated by a vehicle sale depends on the ve-\nhicle\u2019s range when operating on electric power.  See \nCal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(d)(5).  For example, a \nplug-in hybrid vehicle with a \u201c50 mile\u201d electric range \nearns one credit, while a fully battery-electric vehicle \nwith a \u201c350 mile\u201d range earns four credits.3  As a re-\nsult, a fleet may satisfy the standards even though \nZEV sales as a percentage of light-duty vehicles sold \nis well below the applicable ZEV credit percentage re-\nquirement.  \nThe Advanced Clean Cars I standards affected \nmodel years beginning in 2017 (for greenhouse-gas \nemissions) and 2018 (for ZEV requirements).  Both \nsets of standards were originally structured to in-\ncrease in stringency through model year 2025 and re-\nmain in effect at 2025 levels for subsequent model \nyears.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1961.3(a)(1)(A) \n(2012); id. \u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2012); J.A. 50.  In 2022, \nhowever, California amended the ZEV standards (but \nnot the greenhouse-gas standards) to expire after \nmodel year 2025.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \n\u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2022).4 \n \n3 78 Fed. Reg. at 2114-2115; see Cal. Air Res. Bd., ACC II ZEV \nTechnology Assessment, at 11-12 tbl. 2 (Apr. 12, 2022) (showing \nelectric ranges of model year 2021 battery and plug-in hybrid ve-\nhicles), https://tinyurl.com/2d2db9vc (last visited Mar. 11, 2025).  \n4  California adopted that amendment because its Advanced \nClean Cars II standards included a new set of ZEV requirements \napplicable to model years 2026 and beyond.  See Cal. Code Regs. \ntit. 13, \u00a7 1962.4(a) (2022).  EPA granted a waiver for the Ad-\nvanced Clean Cars II standards on December 17, 2024.  90 Fed. \n(continued\u2026) \n\n \n7 \n \nCalifornia requested a waiver for the Advanced \nClean Cars I program in 2012.  That request described \nhow the new standards would increase production of \nzero-emission vehicles, thus decreasing emissions of \ncriteria pollutants and greenhouse gases.  J.A. 34-35, \n40-44.  EPA granted the waiver in early 2013.  78 Fed. \nReg. at 2145.  As the Federal Register notice of that \naction observed, petitions for judicial review were due \nby March 11, 2013.  Id.; see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1).  No-\nbody challenged EPA\u2019s decision to grant the waiver. \nMore than six years later, EPA withdrew the parts \nof the waiver at issue in this case.  84 Fed. Reg. 51,310 \n(Sept. 27, 2019).  By that time, automakers had made \n\u201cinvestments to meet\u201d the greenhouse-gas and ZEV \nstandards and \u201chad adjusted their fleets to comply \nwith\u201d them.  Pet. App. 12a; see id. at 124a.  Consumers \nhad grown increasingly familiar with zero-emission \nvehicles.  Even after the waiver was withdrawn, con-\nsumer demand for those vehicles continued to grow \nand automakers continued to announce plans to sell \nthem in greater numbers.  J.A. 191-192, 201-203.  By \n2020, for example, zero-emission vehicles were around \n8% of the new light-duty vehicles registered in Califor-\nnia; that figure jumped to over 12% the following \nyear.5 \nIn 2021, EPA solicited comment on whether it \nshould reinstate the waiver.  The state respondents \nsubmitted a comment in July 2021, explaining that \n \nReg. 642 (2025).  Several challenges to that waiver are now pend-\ning, including one that two of the petitioners here filed on Febru-\nary 28, 2025.  Pet. for Rev., Valero Renewable Fuels Co., LLC v. \nEPA, No. 25-1078 (D.C. Cir.).   \n5 Cal. Energy Comm\u2019n, New ZEV Sales in California, https://ti-\nnyurl.com/pt526fp5 (displaying \u201cZEV Sales Share\u201d in top-right \ncorner when 2020 and 2021 filters are selected). \n\n \n8 \n \nthe withdrawal was unlawful and poorly reasoned.  \nC.A. J.A. 188-215; see J.A. 51-68.  Auto-industry com-\nmenters emphasized the \u201cbillions of dollars of invest-\nment \nin \nelectric \nvehicle \nmanufacturing \nand \ninfrastructure\u201d that automakers had already made as \na result of the 2013 decision to grant the waiver.  J.A. \n103 (National Coalition for Advanced Transportation \ncomment); cf. J.A. 63 (California comment observing \nthat \u201cautomakers have complied with, and often over-\ncomplied with, model years 2017-2020 already\u201d).  EPA \nreinstated the waiver in March 2022.  87 Fed. Reg. \n14,332 (Mar. 14, 2022). \nB. Procedural Background \n1.  The petitioners here are various companies that \nproduce or sell liquid fuels, as well as related trade as-\nsociations.  Pet. App. 2a.  They filed petitions for re-\nview of EPA\u2019s reinstatement decision in the D.C. \nCircuit on May 12, 2022.  Id. at 15a.  The court of ap-\npeals consolidated those cases, along with another \ncase initiated by a group of States led by Ohio.  Id.  \nShortly thereafter, the state respondents here filed an \nunopposed motion for leave to intervene in support of \nEPA, as did various automakers and public-interest \norganizations.  Id. at 15a & nn.4-6; see J.A. 107.  Those \nmotions were granted.  See Pet. App. 15a. \nPetitioners principally argued that EPA\u2019s rein-\nstatement of the waiver contravened the Clean Air \nAct.  Pet. App. 16a.  Before the court of appeals could \nreach the merits of that claim, however, it had to as-\nsure itself of jurisdiction.  Under longstanding circuit \nrules, the opening brief for a petitioner seeking review \nof agency action \u201cmust set forth the basis for the claim \nof standing.\u201d  D.C. Cir. R. 28(a)(7).  And if \u201cstanding is \nnot apparent from the administrative record, the brief \nmust include arguments and evidence establishing the \n\n \n9 \n \nclaim of standing.\u201d  Id.; see also Sierra Club v. EPA, \n292 F.3d 895, 901 (D.C. Cir. 2002). \nPetitioners\u2019 opening brief below devoted just two \nparagraphs to standing.  J.A. 118-119.  Petitioners ex-\nplained that \u201cdepressing the demand\u201d for liquid fuels \n\u201cinjures petitioners and petitioners\u2019 members finan-\ncially.\u201d  Id. at 118.

As their case progresses, they \nmust \u201cpoint to factual evidence\u201d establishing that they \nsatisfied the three elements of standing\u2014injury, cau-\nsation, and redressability\u2014as of the time they filed \nsuit.  Murthy v. Missouri, 603 U.S. 43, 57-58 (2024).  \nThe only question here is how to apply those long-set-\ntled requirements to the peculiar circumstances of this \ncase, involving a waiver of preemption under Section \n209(b) of the Clean Air Act. \nAs petitioners describe things, that question is \n\u201cstraightforward\u201d because standing is automatic here.  \nPet. Br. 35.  Petitioners profit from sales of fuel.  They \nnote that the waiver allowed California to impose \nstate standards limiting greenhouse-gas emissions \nacross automakers\u2019 fleets and requiring automakers to \nsell a certain percentage of zero-emission vehicles.  Pe-\ntitioners assert that \u201c[t]hey promptly challenged \nEPA\u2019s waiver,\u201d id. at 20; that the waiver injures peti-\ntioners and their members by \u201creduc[ing] the use of \nliquid fuel,\u201d id.; and that \u201c[s]etting aside EPA\u2019s waiver \nwould . . . end[] the artificial depression of demand for \npetitioners\u2019 products,\u201d id. at 20-21.  Standing was so \n\u201cobvious,\u201d in their view, that they did not \u201cneed to sup-\nply additional record evidence\u201d to establish redressa-\nbility.  Id. at 17, 18. \nBut \u201capplying the law of standing\u201d frequently de-\nmands a \u201cheavily fact-dependent\u201d inquiry, FDA v. All. \nfor Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 384 (2024), and pe-\ntitioners elide the most salient facts in this case.  EPA \ngranted the relevant waiver in 2013.  Petitioners did \nnot challenge that waiver and neither did anyone else.  \nIt remained in effect for more than six years before \n\n \n2 \n \nEPA withdrew it in 2019.  During those six years, in \nresponse to the state standards and wider national \nand global trends, automakers invested heavily in \nchanging their fleets and building consumer demand \nfor electric vehicles.  Consumer preferences and the \nautomobile market evolved.  Even when EPA with-\ndrew the waiver, automakers accelerated their transi-\ntion to electric vehicles and consumer demand \ncontinued to grow. \nIn 2021, when EPA invited comment on whether to \nreinstate the waiver, the state respondents supported \nreinstatement.  As their comment explained, the with-\ndrawal had exceeded EPA\u2019s authority and it deprived \nCalifornia\u2019s regulations of legal effect.  But by the time \nEPA reinstated the waiver and petitioners challenged \nthat decision in 2022, \u201c\u2018both internal sustainability \ngoals and external market forces\u2019\u201d were pushing \n\u201cmanufacturers to transition toward electric vehicles, \nirrespective of California\u2019s regulations.\u201d  Pet. App. 24a \nn.8.  Indeed, publicly available evidence submitted by \nthe state respondents showed that zero-emission vehi-\ncles sold in California in 2022 already exceeded what \nthe relevant standards required.  Consumers were \nwilling to pay substantial price premiums for those ve-\nhicles.  And automakers had strong incentives to keep \nselling them. \nWhen the court of appeals confronted petitioners\u2019 \nchallenge to the reinstatement, it had to assure itself \nof jurisdiction by evaluating whether vacatur of that \nreinstatement would likely lead automakers to make \nchoices that would redress petitioners\u2019 asserted injury.  \nGiven the circumstances when petitioners filed suit in \nMay 2022, would automakers change their fleets or \nprices in a way that would increase demand for peti-\ntioners\u2019 liquid-fuel products?  Or would automakers \n\n \n3 \n \nexceed the requirements of California\u2019s standards for \ntheir own economic and strategic reasons, even with-\nout a legal requirement to do so?  Petitioners submit-\nted no evidence addressing that critical issue.  And \ngiven that absence of proof, the court of appeals \nproperly held that petitioners failed to meet their bur-\nden of demonstrating redressability. \nPetitioners ask this Court to excuse that failure.  \nThey first urge the Court to adopt a new \u201ccategorical \nrule.\u201d  Pet. Br. 4.  Under that rule, redressability \nwould be established automatically whenever peti-\ntioners challenge a regulation that implicates the use \nof their products\u2014even if the regulation applies only \nto third parties, and even where petitioners introduce \nno evidence indicating that those third parties would \nhave acted differently in the regulation\u2019s absence.  Id.  \nIn the alternative, petitioners ask the Court to credit \ntheir unsubstantiated predictions about how au-\ntomakers might respond to a vacatur.  Id. at 30-35.  \nThose arguments find no support in this Court\u2019s prec-\nedent.  Adopting them would effectively eliminate the \nplaintiff\u2019s \u201cburden of showing that third parties will \nlikely react\u201d to a favorable judgment in a way that pro-\nvides redress.  Dep\u2019t of Com. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, \n768 (2019).  And they would allow a court to assume \nredressability even if all the evidence before it indi-\ncates that a favorable judgment would not, in fact, re-\ndress the plaintiffs\u2019 injury.  This Court should reject \npetitioners\u2019 novel standing theories and affirm the \njudgment below. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal and Regulatory Background \n1.  The Clean Air Act directs EPA to prescribe fed-\neral standards governing emissions of air pollutants \n\n \n4 \n \nfrom new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle en-\ngines.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7521.  Section 209(a) of the Act gen-\nerally preempts States and their political subdivisions \nfrom \u201cadopt[ing] or attempt[ing] to enforce any stand-\nard relating to the control of emissions from new mo-\ntor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines.\u201d  Id. \n\u00a7 7543(a).  But Section 209(b) instructs EPA to \u201cwaive \napplication of [Section 209] to any State which ha[d] \nadopted\u201d qualifying emission standards \u201cprior to \nMarch 30, 1966, if the State determines that the State \nstandards will be, in the aggregate, at least as protec-\ntive of public health and welfare as applicable Federal \nstandards.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7543(b)(1).  If a State makes that de-\ntermination, EPA must waive preemption unless it \nmakes one of three enumerated findings.  See id. \n\u00a7 7543(b)(1)(A)-(C). \nCalifornia is the only State eligible for a waiver un-\nder Section 209(b) because it was the only State that \nhad developed qualifying motor vehicle emissions \nstandards before March 30, 1966.  Pet. App. 7a.  \u201cCon-\ngress recognized that California was already the \n\u2018lead[er] in the establishment of standards for regula-\ntion of automative pollutant emissions\u2019 at a time when \nthe federal government had yet to promulgate any reg-\nulations of its own.\u201d  Engine Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 88 \nF.3d 1075, 1079 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  Congress designed \nSection 209 to allow California to continue to serve as \na \u201c\u2018laboratory for innovation,\u2019\u201d id. at 1080, while also \n\u201cavoid[ing] the economic disruption\u201d that would come \nfrom manufacturers \u201chaving to meet fifty-one separate \nsets of emission control requirements,\u201d Motor & \nEquip. Mfrs. Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. EPA, 627 F.2d 1095, 1109 \n(D.C. Cir. 1979); see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7507 (1977 \namendment allowing other States to adopt standards \n\u201cidentical to the California standards for which a \nwaiver has been granted for such model year\u201d); Pet. \n\n \n5 \n \nApp. 9a n.3 (noting that \u201cseventeen states have chosen \nto adopt some portion of the California regulations\u201d). \nCalifornia received its first waiver in 1968 and has \nreceived additional waivers in every subsequent dec-\nade.1  For instance, EPA granted a waiver in 1993 for \nCalifornia\u2019s first Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) regula-\ntion, which required a specific percentage of light-duty \nvehicles to be zero-emission vehicles with no exhaust \nor evaporative emissions.  58 Fed. Reg. 4166 (Jan. 13, \n1993).2  EPA granted another waiver, in 2009, for Cal-\nifornia\u2019s first set of regulations to control greenhouse-\ngas emissions from motor vehicles.  74 Fed. Reg. \n32,744 (July 8, 2009). \n2.  This litigation concerns a set of emissions \nstandards that California adopted in 2012 as part of \nits Advanced Clean Cars I program.  78 Fed. Reg. 2112 \n(Jan. 9, 2013).  As relevant here, those standards in-\ncluded a requirement that automakers reduce the av-\nerage greenhouse-gas emissions across the fleets of \nvehicles they sell in California.  See id. at 2114.  They \nalso included new ZEV standards, requiring manufac-\nturers to meet specified \u201cZEV credit percentage\u201d re-\nquirements.  Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(b) \n(2012).   \nA manufacturer can satisfy the \u201cZEV credit per-\ncentage\u201d in several ways:  by generating credits from \nsales of qualifying vehicles, purchasing credits from \nother manufacturers, using excess credits banked in \nprior years, or applying credits obtained by overcom-\n \n1 See EPA, Vehicle Emissions California Waivers and Authoriza-\ntions, https://tinyurl.com/3rxscztw (last visited Mar. 6, 2025). \n2  See Cal. Air Res. Bd., Low-Emission Vehicle Program,  \nhttps://tinyurl.com/49m28yze (last visited Mar. 6, 2025). \n\n \n6 \n \nplying with the greenhouse-gas emission require-\nments.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(d)(5); 78 \nFed. Reg. at 2119-2120, 2135.  The number of ZEV \ncredits generated by a vehicle sale depends on the ve-\nhicle\u2019s range when operating on electric power.  See \nCal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(d)(5).  For example, a \nplug-in hybrid vehicle with a \u201c50 mile\u201d electric range \nearns one credit, while a fully battery-electric vehicle \nwith a \u201c350 mile\u201d range earns four credits.3  As a re-\nsult, a fleet may satisfy the standards even though \nZEV sales as a percentage of light-duty vehicles sold \nis well below the applicable ZEV credit percentage re-\nquirement.  \nThe Advanced Clean Cars I standards affected \nmodel years beginning in 2017 (for greenhouse-gas \nemissions) and 2018 (for ZEV requirements).  Both \nsets of standards were originally structured to in-\ncrease in stringency through model year 2025 and re-\nmain in effect at 2025 levels for subsequent model \nyears.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1961.3(a)(1)(A) \n(2012); id. \u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2012); J.A. 50.  In 2022, \nhowever, California amended the ZEV standards (but \nnot the greenhouse-gas standards) to expire after \nmodel year 2025.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \n\u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2022).4 \n \n3 78 Fed. Reg. at 2114-2115; see Cal. Air Res. Bd., ACC II ZEV \nTechnology Assessment, at 11-12 tbl. 2 (Apr. 12, 2022) (showing \nelectric ranges of model year 2021 battery and plug-in hybrid ve-\nhicles), https://tinyurl.com/2d2db9vc (last visited Mar. 11, 2025).  \n4  California adopted that amendment because its Advanced \nClean Cars II standards included a new set of ZEV requirements \napplicable to model years 2026 and beyond.  See Cal. Code Regs. \ntit. 13, \u00a7 1962.4(a) (2022).  EPA granted a waiver for the Ad-\nvanced Clean Cars II standards on December 17, 2024.  90 Fed. \n(continued\u2026) \n\n \n7 \n \nCalifornia requested a waiver for the Advanced \nClean Cars I program in 2012.  That request described \nhow the new standards would increase production of \nzero-emission vehicles, thus decreasing emissions of \ncriteria pollutants and greenhouse gases.  J.A. 34-35, \n40-44.  EPA granted the waiver in early 2013.  78 Fed. \nReg. at 2145.  As the Federal Register notice of that \naction observed, petitions for judicial review were due \nby March 11, 2013.  Id.; see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1).  No-\nbody challenged EPA\u2019s decision to grant the waiver. \nMore than six years later, EPA withdrew the parts \nof the waiver at issue in this case.  84 Fed. Reg. 51,310 \n(Sept. 27, 2019).  By that time, automakers had made \n\u201cinvestments to meet\u201d the greenhouse-gas and ZEV \nstandards and \u201chad adjusted their fleets to comply \nwith\u201d them.  Pet. App. 12a; see id. at 124a.  Consumers \nhad grown increasingly familiar with zero-emission \nvehicles.  Even after the waiver was withdrawn, con-\nsumer demand for those vehicles continued to grow \nand automakers continued to announce plans to sell \nthem in greater numbers.  J.A. 191-192, 201-203.  By \n2020, for example, zero-emission vehicles were around \n8% of the new light-duty vehicles registered in Califor-\nnia; that figure jumped to over 12% the following \nyear.5 \nIn 2021, EPA solicited comment on whether it \nshould reinstate the waiver.  The state respondents \nsubmitted a comment in July 2021, explaining that \n \nReg. 642 (2025).  Several challenges to that waiver are now pend-\ning, including one that two of the petitioners here filed on Febru-\nary 28, 2025.  Pet. for Rev., Valero Renewable Fuels Co., LLC v. \nEPA, No. 25-1078 (D.C. Cir.).   \n5 Cal. Energy Comm\u2019n, New ZEV Sales in California, https://ti-\nnyurl.com/pt526fp5 (displaying \u201cZEV Sales Share\u201d in top-right \ncorner when 2020 and 2021 filters are selected). \n\n \n8 \n \nthe withdrawal was unlawful and poorly reasoned.  \nC.A. J.A. 188-215; see J.A. 51-68.  Auto-industry com-\nmenters emphasized the \u201cbillions of dollars of invest-\nment \nin \nelectric \nvehicle \nmanufacturing \nand \ninfrastructure\u201d that automakers had already made as \na result of the 2013 decision to grant the waiver.  J.A. \n103 (National Coalition for Advanced Transportation \ncomment); cf. J.A. 63 (California comment observing \nthat \u201cautomakers have complied with, and often over-\ncomplied with, model years 2017-2020 already\u201d).  EPA \nreinstated the waiver in March 2022.  87 Fed. Reg. \n14,332 (Mar. 14, 2022). \nB. Procedural Background \n1.  The petitioners here are various companies that \nproduce or sell liquid fuels, as well as related trade as-\nsociations.  Pet. App. 2a.  They filed petitions for re-\nview of EPA\u2019s reinstatement decision in the D.C. \nCircuit on May 12, 2022.  Id. at 15a.  The court of ap-\npeals consolidated those cases, along with another \ncase initiated by a group of States led by Ohio.  Id.  \nShortly thereafter, the state respondents here filed an \nunopposed motion for leave to intervene in support of \nEPA, as did various automakers and public-interest \norganizations.  Id. at 15a & nn.4-6; see J.A. 107.  Those \nmotions were granted.  See Pet. App. 15a. \nPetitioners principally argued that EPA\u2019s rein-\nstatement of the waiver contravened the Clean Air \nAct.  Pet. App. 16a.  Before the court of appeals could \nreach the merits of that claim, however, it had to as-\nsure itself of jurisdiction.  Under longstanding circuit \nrules, the opening brief for a petitioner seeking review \nof agency action \u201cmust set forth the basis for the claim \nof standing.\u201d  D.C. Cir. R. 28(a)(7).  And if \u201cstanding is \nnot apparent from the administrative record, the brief \nmust include arguments and evidence establishing the \n\n \n9 \n \nclaim of standing.\u201d  Id.; see also Sierra Club v. EPA, \n292 F.3d 895, 901 (D.C. Cir. 2002). \nPetitioners\u2019 opening brief below devoted just two \nparagraphs to standing.  J.A. 118-119.  Petitioners ex-\nplained that \u201cdepressing the demand\u201d for liquid fuels \n\u201cinjures petitioners and petitioners\u2019 members finan-\ncially.\u201d  Id. at 118.  They cited documents from Cali-\nfornia\u2019s 2011 rulemaking in which a California agency \nhad forecast the prospect of financial injury to oil and \ngas industry participants.  Id. (citing C.A. J.A. 799, \n801, 830, 832).  Petitioners asserted that \u201c[t]his eco-\nnomic injury . . . is caused by the challenged regula-\ntory action, and this Court can redress that injury by \nsetting aside the action.\u201d  J.A. 118.  They attached 14 \ndeclarations, but the only discussion of redressability \nin those declarations consisted of unsupported asser-\ntions that vacatur would remedy petitioners\u2019 injury.  \nId. at 130, 137, 150, 154, 158, 167. \nIn response, the state respondents argued that pe-\ntitioners had failed to establish standing, emphasizing \nthat petitioners provided no evidence that vacatur of \nthe reinstatement decision in May 2022 would change \nautomakers\u2019 behavior in a way that would increase \nfuel sales.  J.A. 185-187.  The state respondents also \nsubmitted evidence undermining the likelihood of any \nsuch change:  by 2022, sales of zero-emission vehicles \nin California exceeded what was required by the rele-\nvant standards; consumer demand for those vehicles \nwas growing, as was consumer willingness to pay price \npremiums; and many manufacturers had announced \nplans for even greater zero-emission vehicle sales in \nthe future.  Id. at 191-195, 201-203.  On reply, peti-\ntioners did not submit record evidence countering the \nstate respondents\u2019 evidence about the circumstances \nin 2022.  See id. at 209-211. \n\n \n10 \n \nAt oral argument, the panel questioned petitioners \nabout jurisdiction, with a particular focus on the \u201car-\ngument that you haven\u2019t demonstrated redressabil-\nity.\u201d  C.A. Oral Arg. 25:50-26:12.  Two weeks later, \npetitioners sought leave to file a supplemental brief \nand to supplement the record with two new declara-\ntions.  Pet. App. 30a.  The proposed brief and declara-\ntions mostly addressed the separate issue of mootness.  \nSee C.A. Private Pet. Proposed Supp. Br. 1-3, 4-13.  In \na short section on standing, petitioners characterized \nthe arguments against redressability as \u201cimplausible\u201d \nand \u201cincredible,\u201d id. at 3, 4\u2014but again cited no evi-\ndence establishing how judicial relief in May 2022 \nwould have redressed their asserted injuries, and did \nnot attempt to counter the state respondents\u2019 evidence \non that point.   \n2.  The court of appeals concluded that it lacked ju-\nrisdiction to decide petitioners\u2019 challenge because pe-\ntitioners had failed to establish Article III standing.  \nPet. App. 16a-19a.  Without deciding whether petition-\ners had established injury or causation, the court ex-\nplained that petitioners fell \u201cfar short of meeting their \nburden\u201d to establish a likelihood \u201cthat their alleged \ninjuries would be redressed\u201d if the court agreed with \npetitioners\u2019 merits theory and vacated EPA\u2019s rein-\nstatement decision.  Id. at 21a. \nAs the court explained, redressability for petition-\ners \u201c\u2018hinge[d] on\u2019 the actions of third parties\u2014the au-\ntomobile manufacturers who are subject to the \nwaiver.\u201d  Pet. App. 22a.  Petitioners needed to show \nthat automakers would respond to vacatur of the rein-\nstatement \u201cby producing and selling fewer non-con-\nventional vehicles or by altering the prices of their \nvehicles such that fewer non-conventional vehicles\u2014\nand more conventional vehicles\u2014were sold.\u201d  Id.  But \n\n \n11 \n \nthe record indicated \u201cthat \u2018manufacturers are already \nselling more qualifying vehicles in California than the \nState\u2019s standards require,\u2019\u201d id. at 28a, and \u201cthat \u2018both \ninternal sustainability goals and external market \nforces\u2019 are prompting manufacturers to transition to-\nward electric vehicles, irrespective of California\u2019s reg-\nulations,\u201d id. at 24a n.8; see also id. at 28a. \nNevertheless, the court of appeals observed, peti-\ntioners \u201ctreated redressability as a foregone conclu-\nsion\u201d instead of making a factual showing.  Pet. App. \n25a.  They did not \u201cattempt[] to explain in any detail \nhow their injuries are redressable, let alone to \u2018cit[e] \nany record evidence\u2019 or to file \u2018additional affidavits or \nother evidence sufficient to support\u2019 redressability.\u201d  \nId. at 24a-25a.  Nor did petitioners \u201cmeaningfully ad-\ndress[]\u201d redressability on reply, after the state re-\nspondents \nintroduced \narguments \nand \nevidence \ncontesting redressability.  Id. at 28a.  \u201cUltimately, the \nrecord evidence, coupled with the filings of the EPA \nand intervenors, provide[d] th[e] Court with no basis \nto conclude that Petitioners\u2019 claims are redressable\u2014\na necessary element of standing that Petitioners bear \nthe burden of establishing.\u201d  Id. at 29a. \nThe court of appeals also described its understand-\ning that the challenge before it \u201cconcern[ed] only\u201d the \nreinstatement of the waiver \u201cas to Model Years 2017 \nthrough 2025.\u201d  Pet. App. 22a.  But see supra p. 6; infra \np. 44.  On that understanding, the court explained, pe-\ntitioners had to show \u201cnot only that automobile man-\nufacturers are likely to respond to a decision by this \nCourt by changing their fleets in a way that alleviates \n[petitioners\u2019] injuries in some way, but also that auto-\nmobile manufacturers would do so relatively quickly\u2014\nby Model Year 2025.\u201d  Pet. App. 23a.  That timing ele-\n\n \n12 \n \nment \u201cfurther complicated\u201d the redressability analy-\nsis,\u201d in the court\u2019s view.  Id. at 22a.  \u201c[E]ven if\u201d peti-\ntioners \nhad \nestablished \nthat \n\u201cautomobile \nmanufacturers were inclined to change course\u201d in re-\nsponse to a vacatur in a way that would increase fuel \nsales, it was \u201cfar from clear that they could do so\u201d by \nmodel year 2025.  Id. at 24a; see id. at 23a. \nFinally, the court of appeals denied petitioners\u2019 \npost-argument motion for leave to file a supplemental \nbrief and declarations.  Pet. App. 30a-32a.  The court \nexplained that, under the circumstances, petitioners \nshould have understood their obligation to address re-\ndressability in their opening brief.  Id. at 31a.  Moreo-\nver, \u201c[p]etitioners offer[ed] no explanation for having \nfailed to address redressability in their reply brief af-\nter California raised the issue in its opposition brief.\u201d  \nId. at 32a. \nPetitioners did not seek panel rehearing or rehear-\ning en banc.  They instead filed a petition for a writ of \ncertiorari respecting both the redressability question \nand the merits of their statutory claim (which the \ncourt of appeals had not reached).  This Court granted \ncertiorari on the redressability question only.6 \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nPetitioners sought a judgment vacating EPA\u2019s re-\ninstatement of a nearly decade-old waiver.  Under set-\ntled precedent, petitioners had the burden of \nestablishing that automakers would likely respond to \n \n6 This Court also denied a petition for certiorari filed by Ohio and \nother petitioners, which advanced a separate constitutional \nclaim.  See Ohio v. EPA, No. 24-13 (Dec. 16, 2024).  The court of \nappeals had held that the Ohio petitioners established standing \nto bring that claim, but it rejected the claim on the merits.  See \nPet. App. 32a-49a. \n\n \n13 \n \nthat vacatur in ways that would increase demand for \npetitioners\u2019 liquid-fuel products.  By the time they \nfiled suit in May 2022, however, the likely effect of a \nvacatur was not self-evident:  in the nine years since \nEPA first granted the waiver, automakers had made \nenormous investments in producing and marketing \nzero-emission vehicles; consumer demand for those ve-\nhicles had recently surged; and evidence before the \nCourt indicated that automakers would continue to \nsell those vehicles in large numbers regardless of the \nreinstatement or its potential vacatur.  Article III re-\nquired petitioners to introduce current evidence but-\ntressing their assertion that a vacatur in 2022 would \nlead automakers to change their fleets or prices in \nways that would increase liquid-fuel sales.  Because \npetitioners did not even attempt to do so, the court of \nappeals properly held that they failed to establish \nstanding. \nIn this Court, petitioners advance several novel \ntheories for why they had no obligation to introduce \nany evidence of redressability.  None of those theories \nis persuasive.  They first propose a categorical rule \nthat redressability is automatically established when-\never a challenged government action implicates the \nuse of the challenger\u2019s products.  Pet. Br. 17-18.  Prec-\nedent forecloses that proposal:  this Court has consist-\nently focused on the particular facts of a case\u2014and \nrequired challengers to submit specific evidence sup-\nporting redressability before obtaining a final judg-\nment.  For similar reasons, plaintiffs may not rely on \nunsupported predictions about the effects of a judg-\nment on a third party\u2019s choices.  See id. at 18.  They \nmust instead meet \u201ctheir burden of showing that third \nparties will likely react in predictable ways\u201d by intro-\nducing actual evidence.  Dep\u2019t of Com. v. New York, \n588 U.S. 752, 768 (2019).  And the fact that a statute \n\n \n14 \n \nor regulation \u201cdoes not sunset\u201d (Pet. Br. 19) does not, \nby itself, establish standing to challenge it. \nFinally, petitioners\u2019 belated attempts to identify \nrecord evidence supporting redressability cannot \nchange the outcome here.  Their briefs and declara-\ntions below were conclusory on the subject of redress-\nability.  The additional evidence they describe in this \nCourt not only comes too late, it would have been in-\nsufficient even if they had presented it below:  it con-\nsists of outdated projections that cannot substitute for \nevidence about the market as it existed when petition-\ners filed this challenge in May 2022. \nARGUMENT \nI. PETITIONERS FAILED TO ESTABLISH REDRESSA-\nBILITY \nPetitioners had the burden to establish standing.  \nAs to redressability, they had to show that judicial va-\ncatur of the reinstatement decision at the time they \nfiled suit in May 2022 would likely lead to increased \nfuel sales.  They failed to carry that burden.   \nA. It Was Petitioners\u2019 Burden to Introduce \nEvidence Establishing Each Element of \nArticle III Standing \nBefore turning to the merits of a suit, a court must \nassure itself of jurisdiction.  Summers v. Earth Island \nInst., 555 U.S. 488, 499 (2009).  The \u201cburden of estab-\nlishing\u201d jurisdiction lies with \u201cthe party asserting ju-\nrisdiction.\u201d  Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., \n511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994) (citing McNutt v. Gen. Motors \nAcceptance Corp. of Ind., 298 U.S. 178, 182-183 \n(1936)). \nStanding is \u201can essential and unchanging part\u201d of \nArticle III jurisdiction.  Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 \n\n \n15 \n \nU.S. 555, 560 (1992).  The doctrine of standing is built \non \u201cthe idea of separation of powers.\u201d  United States v. \nTexas, 599 U.S. 670, 675 (2023).  It \u201cimplements \u2018the \nFramers\u2019 concept of the proper\u2014and properly lim-\nited\u2014role of the courts in a democratic society.\u2019\u201d  FDA \nv. All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 380 (2024) \n(quoting Roberts, Article III Limits on Statutory \nStanding, 42 Duke L.J. 1219, 1220 (1993)). \nThe \u201cirreducible constitutional minimum of stand-\ning contains three elements.\u201d  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560.  \nFirst, the party bringing suit \u201cmust have suffered an \n\u2018injury in fact.\u2019\u201d  Id.  Second, that injury must \u201cbe \n\u2018fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defend-\nant, and not the result of the independent action of \nsome third party not before the court.\u2019\u201d  Id. (altera-\ntions omitted).  And third, \u201cit must be \u2018likely,\u2019 as op-\nposed to merely \u2018speculative,\u2019 that the injury will be \n\u2018redressed by a favorable decision.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 561.  Each \nelement is assessed as of the time the suit commenced.  \nMurthy v. Missouri, 603 U.S. 43, 58 (2024). \nA party seeking to invoke the jurisdiction of a fed-\neral court \u201cmust support each element of standing \n\u2018with the manner and degree of evidence required at \nthe successive stages of the litigation.\u2019\u201d  Murthy, 603 \nU.S. at 58.  At the outset of litigation, \u201c\u2018mere allega-\ntions\u2019\u201d may suffice; as the case progresses, a party \n\u201cmust . . . point to factual evidence.\u201d  Id.  A petitioner \nwho challenges agency action may be able to carry its \nburden by identifying evidence in the administrative \nrecord that establishes its standing.  See, e.g., Sierra \nClub v. EPA, 292 F.3d 895, 899-900 (D.C. Cir. 2002).  \nBut if \u201cstanding is not apparent from the administra-\ntive record,\u201d a petitioner\u2019s \u201cbrief must include argu-\nments and evidence establishing the claim of \nstanding.\u201d  D.C. Cir. R. 28(a)(7); see Sierra Club, 292 \n\n \n16 \n \nF.3d at 900; see generally 15 Redish, Moore\u2019s Federal \nPractice \u00a7\u00a7 101.31, 101.61[10] (3d ed. & Supp. 2025). \nSometimes standing analysis is straightforward.  \nFor instance, in some cases the party invoking the \ncourt\u2019s jurisdiction is itself \u201can object of\u201d the chal-\nlenged government action.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.  \nThe government might, for example, proscribe speech \nthat the plaintiff engages in.  See, e.g., Susan B. An-\nthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 161-167 (2014).  \nOr it might require a state plaintiff to engage in par-\nticular regulation.  See, e.g., West Virginia v. EPA, 597 \nU.S. 697, 718-719 (2022).  In those scenarios, \u201cthere is \nordinarily little question that the action . . . has \ncaused [the plaintiff] injury, and that a judgment pre-\nventing . . . the action will redress\u201d that injury.  Lujan, \n504 U.S. at 561-562; see All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 \nU.S. at 382. \nIn other scenarios, \u201cmuch more is needed.\u201d  Lujan, \n504 U.S. at 562.  When a party\u2019s \u201casserted injury \narises from the government\u2019s allegedly unlawful regu-\nlation . . . of someone else,\u201d for example, standing can \nbe \u201c\u2018substantially more difficult\u2019 to establish.\u201d  Id.  In \nthose cases, \u201ccausation and redressability ordinarily \nhinge on the response of\u201d that third party\u2014\u201cand per-\nhaps on the response of others as well.\u201d  Id.  Because \nthe inquiry turns on \u201cchoices made by independent ac-\ntors not before the courts,\u201d the plaintiff must \u201cadduce \nfacts showing that those choices have been or will be \nmade in such manner as to produce causation and per-\nmit redressability of injury.\u201d  Id.  For instance, if plain-\ntiffs are injured by the lack of affordable private \nhousing, they must show \u201can actionable causal rela-\ntionship\u201d between the challenged zoning ordinance \nand the choices of private third parties who build and \nsell housing.  Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 507 \n\n \n17 \n \n(1975).  Their claim may not proceed if the asserted \ninjury instead results from \u201cthe economics of the area \nhousing market.\u201d  Id. at 506; see generally id. at 508 \n(requiring the party \u201cwho seeks to challenge\u201d a gov-\nernment action to introduce \u201cspecific, concrete facts \ndemonstrating . . . that he personally would benefit in \na tangible way from the court\u2019s intervention\u201d). \nConcrete evidence from the plaintiff is especially \ncritical if another party has introduced evidence un-\ndermining the asserted theory of standing.  \u201cWhen \nchallenged by . . . an opposing party,\u201d for example, a \nplaintiff \u201cinvoking the court\u2019s jurisdiction cannot \nsimply allege a nonobvious harm, without more.\u201d  \nWittman v. Personhuballah, 578 U.S. 539, 545 (2016).  \nAnd if \u201cthere is no \u2018more,\u2019\u201d then there is no jurisdic-\ntion.  Id.; see generally Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U.S. \n77, 96-97 (2010) (when defendants raise facts calling \njurisdiction into doubt, plaintiffs \u201cmust support their \nallegations by competent proof\u201d). \nB. The Circumstances of This Case Raised a \nSerious Question as to Whether Petition-\ners\u2019 Claim Was Redressable \nAs the court of appeals recognized, this is not a case \nwhere standing is self-evident.  Petitioners comprise \ncompanies that produce or refine fuel, companies that \ndevelop biorefining technology, and various trade as-\nsociations (for energy companies, farmers, and con-\nvenience store owners).  Pet. Br. II-V, 20.  They claim \nan injury of financial harm from reduced fuel sales.  \nId. at 21-22.  But the standards at issue here do not \nregulate fuel production or sales.  Instead, the stand-\nards regulate an activity in which petitioners do not \nparticipate:  automobile sales.  Because petitioners are \nnot directly regulated by the challenged agency action, \n\n \n18 \n \nthey needed to identify evidence showing that au-\ntomakers who are subject to those standards would \nmake choices that would \u201cproduce causation and per-\nmit redressability of injury.\u201d  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 562. \nPetitioners\u2019 theory is that the state emissions \nstandards injure them by effectively requiring au-\ntomakers to sell more \u201cvehicles that use less or no liq-\nuid fuel,\u201d which reduces demand for petitioners\u2019 \nproducts.  Pet. Br. 17.  They posit that their revenues \nwould increase if the standards no longer had legal ef-\nfect, because automakers would then make and sell \nmore cars that run on liquid fuel.  Id. at 24.  That the-\nory would indeed have been \u201cstraightforward\u201d (id. at \n35) if petitioners had promptly sought review follow-\ning EPA\u2019s original approval of the waiver in 2013\u2014as \nthey recently did in challenging the Advanced Clean \nCars II waiver, see supra p. 6 n.4.7 \nIn calendar year 2013, zero-emission vehicles made \nup about 2% of light-duty vehicle sales in California.8  \nTo meet the \u201cminimum ZEV credit percentage\u201d re-\nquirements of the Advanced Clean Cars I standards, \n \n7 Petitioners have suggested that D.C. Circuit precedent prohib-\nited them from challenging the 2013 action because California \ndeemed compliance with federal standards to satisfy the state \nstandards.  See Pet. 8 (citing Chamber of Com. of U.S. v. EPA, \n642 F.3d 192, 206 (D.C. Cir. 2011)); Pet. Br. 8-9.  But California\u2019s \nZEV standards\u2014the main focus of petitioners\u2019 present chal-\nlenge\u2014never contained a \u201cdeemed-to-comply\u201d provision, and \nthus could have been challenged in 2013.  J.A. 59-60 n.14 \n(deemed-to-comply provision \u201conly applies to the [greenhouse-\ngas] standard\u201d). \n8 See Cal. Air Res. Bd., California\u2019s Advanced Clean Cars Mid-\nterm Review, App. B, at B15 fig. 9 (Jan. 18, 2017), https://ti-\nnyurl.com/yrzdx3t4. \n\n \n19 \n \nautomakers needed to grow their zero-emission vehi-\ncle sales many times over:  they would have to meet a \nminimum credit percentage of 4.5% by model year \n2018, rising to 22% by model year 2025.  Cal. Code \nRegs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2012).  Regulators es-\ntimated that meeting that 22% credit requirement \nwould require zero-emission vehicles to comprise \nabout 15% of light-duty new-vehicle sales by 2025.  See \nJ.A. 16, 32; 78 Fed. Reg. 2112, 2119 (Jan. 9, 2013).  Ab-\nsent the new regulatory requirement, there was no \nreason to think automakers would make that shift for \ntheir own independent reasons.  Consumers in 2013 \nwere largely unfamiliar with zero-emission vehicles or \nhad a negative impression of them.9  And automakers \nwarned that \u201cconsumer demand for ZEVs\u201d was so ane-\nmic that they might not even be able to meet the re-\nquirements for model year 2018.  78 Fed. Reg. at 2140.   \nBut petitioner challenged EPA\u2019s reinstatement of \nthe waiver nearly a decade later.  By then, companies \nhad been \u201cmaking investments\u201d for years \u201cin updating \ntheir fleets and growing consumer demand for electric \nvehicles.\u201d  Pet. App. 12a, 14a.  They had built factories \nto make batteries and electric cars.

Br. 18, 34, 35) in \nMay 2022 that reduced sales of petitioners\u2019 fuel prod-\nucts were caused by the reinstatement of the waiver\u2014\ninstead of market forces and automakers\u2019 prior invest-\nments and plans.  Nor was it obvious that vacatur of \nthe reinstatement would likely affect automakers\u2019 fu-\nture behavior in a way that would redress the asserted \ninjury. \nIndeed, evidence submitted by the state respond-\nents indicated the opposite.  Publicly accessible sales \ndata showed that \u201czero-emission vehicles sold in cal-\nendar year 2022\u201d in California \u201cexceed what [the] \nstandards require.\u201d  J.A. 192.  For that calendar year, \nabout 19% of light-duty vehicles sold in the State qual-\nified as zero-emission vehicles under California\u2019s \nstandards\u2014exceeding the 15% that regulators had \nforecast would be needed for compliance.  Id. at 191-\n192; see supra p. 19.  The lion\u2019s share of those sales \n(16% of total light-duty sales) were battery-electric ve-\nhicles.13   \nThat represented a surge in sales of battery-elec-\ntric vehicles that far outpaced early forecasts.  The \nforecasts had projected that automakers would need \nbattery-electric vehicles to be just 3.7% of total light-\nduty sales by model year 2025 to meet the credit re-\nquirements of the ZEV standards.  J.A. 9.  The unex-\npected consumer shift to battery-electric vehicles \n(rather than plug-in hybrids, as forecasters originally \n \n13\n New \nZEV \nSales \nin \nCalifornia, \nsupra, \nhttps://ti-\nnyurl.com/pt526fp5 (displaying 262,076 \u201cBEV\u201d out of 1,581,844 \nannual light-duty sales when 2022 filter is selected). \n\n \n22 \n \nanticipated) had profound consequences for automak-\ners\u2019 compliance with the Advanced Clean Cars I stand-\nards.  Because battery-electric vehicles can travel \nlonger distances without emitting tailpipe pollutants, \nthey yield the most \u201cZEV credits\u201d for purposes of the \nstandards.  See supra p. 6.  So the fact that 16% of \nlight-duty sales were battery-electric vehicles in 2022 \nyielded a ZEV credit percentage for that year that was \nfar above the highest requirement that the standards \nwould ever impose.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \n\u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2012) (22% ZEV credit requirement \nstarting in model year 2025).  And sales in California \nin 2022 were also exceeding the most stringent re-\nquirements of the fleetwide greenhouse-gas stand-\nards, even for future years, because the battery-\nelectric vehicles also have far lower emissions than \nplug-in hybrids.  See J.A. 7. \nBy May 2022, nine years after EPA first granted a \nwaiver for the Advanced Clean Cars I standards, there \nwas substantial reason to believe that automakers \nwould exceed the standards for their own reasons even \nwithout the reinstatement.  The court of appeals could \nnot \u201cpresume[]\u201d that petitioners\u2019 challenge was re-\ndressable.  Kokkonen, 511 U.S. at 377.  Nor could it \nassume redressability based on petitioners\u2019 \u201cuna-\ndorned speculation.\u201d  Simon v. E. Ky. Welfare Rts. \nOrg., 426 U.S. 26, 44 (1976).  Article III required the \ncourt to ask whether petitioners had \u201cmet their bur-\nden\u201d by introducing evidence demonstrating that au-\ntomakers would \u201clikely react\u201d to a vacatur of the 2022 \nreinstatement in ways that would increase demand for \npetitioners\u2019 products and services.  Dep\u2019t of Com. v. \nNew York, 588 U.S. 752, 768 (2019).   \n\n \n23 \n \nC. Petitioners Did Not Introduce Evidence \nEstablishing Redressability \nPetitioners did not carry their evidentiary burden.  \nIndeed, they submitted virtually no argument or evi-\ndence bearing on the likely effect of a vacatur on the \nmarket as it existed in 2022.   \n1.  Petitioners\u2019 opening brief in the court of appeals \ndevoted one sentence to redressability.  They asserted \nthat their \u201cinjury is caused by the challenged regula-\ntory action, and this Court can redress that injury by \nsetting aside the action.\u201d  J.A. 118.  That single con-\nclusory statement was not supported by any citation \nto evidence in the administrative record or elsewhere.  \nPetitioners attached 14 standing declarations to their \nopening brief.  See J.A. 120-184.  But none of those \ndeclarations was sufficient to carry their burden. \nThe bulk of each declaration described the declar-\nant\u2019s asserted injuries, with details supporting the \n(undisputed) proposition that petitioners and their \nmembers profit from fuel sales.  The declarants had \nalmost nothing to say about the critical question going \nto causation and redressability, which \u201care often \u2018flip \nsides of the same coin.\u2019\u201d  All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 \nU.S. at 380.  That question was whether, in 2022, the \nreinstatement of the waiver or the vacatur of that re-\ninstatement would affect automakers\u2019 choices in a \nmanner leading to changes in fuel sales.   \nOf the declarants who addressed causation, some \nasserted their \u201cunderstand[ing] that California\u2019s \ngreenhouse-gas standards and zero-emission-vehicle \nmandate reduce the demand for fuel in California.\u201d  \nJ.A. 125, 140, 169, 183; see also J.A. 176.  Those asser-\ntions were not accompanied by supporting facts or any \ndiscussion of the circumstances in 2022.  Other declar-\nants invoked statements from California about how \n\n \n24 \n \nthe standards would reduce demand for liquid fuels.  \nId. at 129, 136-137, 148, 153, 157, 166, 173, 180.  Peti-\ntioners now describe those statements as \u201crecent[] \nproject[ions] that the waiver would \u2018reduce emissions \nthrough reductions in fuel production.\u2019\u201d  Pet. Br. 38 \n(citing J.A. 148, 180).  But the projections are not \u201cre-\ncent\u201d at all.  They are from California\u2019s \u201c2012 Waiver \nRequest\u201d\u2014and state rulemaking documents submit-\nted as part of that request\u2014prepared a decade before \nthe challenged reinstatement and petitioners\u2019 suit.  \nJ.A. 148, 180; see also id. at 180 (citing state estimates \nfrom 2011).  Those outdated sources did not establish \nthat any reduced fuel sales in 2022 were caused by the \nwaiver\u2019s reinstatement instead of the dramatic \nchanges in the market and consumer demand that \npredated the reinstatement.14  \nThe declarants who addressed redressability did so \nin a single boilerplate sentence asserting that petition-\ners\u2019 \u201cinjuries would be substantially ameliorated if \nEPA\u2019s decision were set aside.\u201d  J.A. 130, 137, 150, \n154, 158, 167, 181; see Pet. App. 21a-22a.  Again, not \none of the declarants addressed the state of the market \nin 2022, when petitioners filed their suit.  Nor did they \nsay a word about automakers\u2019 behavior at that time, \nor the economic and other considerations that would \nshape automakers\u2019 response to a judicial vacatur.  See \ngenerally Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Env\u2019t \nServs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 201 (2000) (Scalia, J., \ndissenting) (discussing this Court\u2019s \u201crefus[al] to find \n \n14 One declarant also referenced a 2020 report by a Minnesota \nagency.

In any event, petitioners\u2019 briefs in the court of appeals \nnever mentioned effects on the Minnesota market as a basis for \nstanding. \n\n \n25 \n \nstanding based on the \u2018conclusory allegations of an af-\nfidavit\u2019\u201d); Lujan v. Nat\u2019l Wildlife Fed\u2019n, 497 U.S. 871, \n898-899 (1990) (\u201cagree[ing]\u201d that an affidavit was \u201cin-\nsufficient to establish [the challenger\u2019s] right to seek \njudicial review\u201d where it was \u201c\u2018conclusory and com-\npletely devoid of specific facts\u2019\u201d with respect to the key \nissue). \nEven after the state respondents submitted their \nown evidence addressing those subjects and undercut-\nting petitioners\u2019 theory of redressability, supra p. 9, \npetitioners did not \u201cmeaningfully address[] the re-\ndressability of their economic injuries in their reply \nbrief[].\u201d  Pet. App. 28a-29a.  Their primary contention \non reply was that the States\u2019 argument \u201cdefies com-\nmon sense.\u201d  J.A. 209.  They also quoted statements \nfrom the state respondents\u2019 July 2021 comment in sup-\nport of the reinstatement.  Id. at 210; see Pet. Br. 38 \n(citing J.A. 66).  Those statements explained why \nEPA\u2019s 2019 decision to revoke the waiver was unjusti-\nfied based on the record EPA had before it in that year, \nsee J.A. 66 (citing 84 Fed. Reg. 51,310, 51,337 (Sept. \n27, 2019)), and then described California\u2019s \u201cdemon-\nstration in its 2012 waiver request,\u201d J.A. 66.  Neither \nstatement could have taken account of the market \ndata showing that zero-emission vehicle sales tripled \nbetween 2020 and mid-2022.  See id. at 191. \nAnd petitioners\u2019 reply (J.A. 208-212) did not mean-\ningfully address that more recent data either\u2014or the \nevidence showing that market penetration of zero-\nemission vehicles in California in 2022 far exceeded \nany current or future requirement of the relevant \nstandards.  Nor did petitioners respond to the evidence \nindicating that automakers would \u201cha[ve] a similar in-\ncentive to engage in\u201d the promotion and sale of zero-\n\n \n26 \n \nemission vehicles even if the standards were not in ef-\nfect.  Clapper v. Amnesty Int\u2019l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 417 \n(2013); see Warth, 422 U.S. at 506 (no standing where \nevidence suggested that plaintiffs\u2019 injury was \u201cthe con-\nsequence of the economics of the . . . market\u201d).15 \nIn short, petitioners\u2019 initial submission relied on \nthe \u201cpossibility, unsubstantiated by allegations of fact, \nthat their situation . . . might improve were the court \nto afford relief.\u201d  Warth, 422 U.S. at 507.  And petition-\ners\u2019 submission on reply neglected their duty to \u201csup-\nport their allegations by competent proof,\u201d once \n\u201cchallenged on allegations of jurisdictional facts.\u201d  \nHertz Corp., 559 U.S. at 96-97.   \n2.  Article III demanded more.  This Court has re-\npeatedly rejected theories of redressability that de-\npend on \u201c\u2018guesswork as to how independent \ndecisionmakers will exercise their judgment\u2019\u201d instead \nof concrete evidence submitted by the party seeking to \ninvoke federal jurisdiction.  Murthy, 603 U.S. at 57; \nsee, e.g., id. at 73-74; Haaland v. Brackeen, 599 U.S. \n255, 293-294 (2023); Lujan, 504 U.S. at 568-571 (plu-\nrality opinion); Simon, 426 U.S. at 42-43.  \u201cA federal \ncourt cannot ignore\u201d a party\u2019s failure to establish re-\ndressability \u201cwithout overstepping its assigned role in \nour system of adjudicating only actual cases and con-\ntroversies.\u201d  Simon, 426 U.S. at 39.  Because petition-\ners did not provide the court of appeals with any facts \nshowing a likelihood that vacating EPA\u2019s 2022 rein-\nstatement would redress their asserted injuries, the \ncourt properly held that it lacked jurisdiction to decide \nthe merits.  Pet. App. 30a. \n \n15 See generally Nat\u2019l Council for Adoption v. Blinken, 4 F.4th \n106, 111-112 (D.C. Cir. 2021) (discussing when standing evidence \nmay be introduced on reply).   \n\n \n27 \n \nNo one can doubt petitioners\u2019 desire to obtain an \nimmediate and definitive judicial resolution of their \nmerits theories.  See Pet. 26-27.  But the requirements \nof Article III often \u201cmean[] that the federal courts de-\ncide some contested legal questions later rather than \nsooner.\u201d  All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 380.  \nThe court of appeals properly adhered to those re-\nquirements here, refusing to reach the merits after pe-\ntitioners forewent any genuine effort to introduce facts \nestablishing a likelihood that vacatur of the 2022 re-\ninstatement would increase demand for their prod-\nucts. \nII. PETITIONERS IDENTIFY NO VALID BASIS FOR RE-\nVERSAL \nHaving failed \u201cto \u2018cit[e] any record evidence\u2019 or to \nfile \u2018additional affidavits or other evidence sufficient to \nsupport\u2019 redressability\u201d in the court below, Pet. App. \n24a-25a, petitioners now ask this Court to hold that \nthey did \u201cnot need to supply additional record evi-\ndence,\u201d Pet. Br. 17.  They advance three theories:  \n(i) that the Court should \u201cadopt [a] categorical rule\u201d \nthat this type of government action \u201calone suffices to \nestablish redressability,\u201d id. at 17, 18; (ii) that redress-\nability follows from the purported \u201cpredictable effects\u201d \nof the 2022 reinstatement on automakers, id. at 18; \nand (iii) that the duration of the challenged waiver, by \nitself, establishes redressability, see id. at 19, 45-47.  \nBut this Court\u2019s precedent forecloses those theories.  \nAnd petitioners\u2019 attempt to argue, in the alternative, \nthat the record contains \u201cplenty [of] evidence\u201d support-\ning redressability (id. at 37) ignores the gulf between \nthe referenced evidence and the question that mat-\ntered:  how automakers would likely have responded \nto a decision vacating the waiver in May 2022.   \n\n \n28 \n \nA. Government Regulations Implicating the \nUse of a Product Do Not Categorically Es-\ntablish Standing for Producers to Sue \nPetitioners first propose a categorical rule that re-\ndressability is automatically established in every chal-\nlenge seeking to \u201cremove a regulatory impediment to \nthe use of petitioners\u2019 products.\u201d  Pet. Br. 17.  They \nnever clarify the scope of the word \u201cimpediment.\u201d  But \nit appears that their rule would cover a flat prohibition \non the use of a product as well as any lesser restriction \nthat allegedly affects or implicates its use.  And the \nrule would apply even where (as here) the record con-\ntains evidence indicating that a favorable judgment \nwould not actually redress the asserted injury.  That \nnovel proposal finds no basis in this Court\u2019s precedent.  \nFor a court to conclude that it has jurisdiction, the \n\u201c\u2018specific facts\u2019\u201d matter\u2014as does the \u201cevidence\u201d sub-\nmitted by the parties.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561. \n1. Petitioners\u2019 proposed rule is at odds \nwith the precedent they invoke \nPetitioners point to Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154 \n(1997), as support for their proposed rule.  Pet. Br. 25-\n26.  That decision reiterated that an injury resulting \nfrom \u201cthe independent action of some third party not \nbefore the court\u201d is insufficient to establish Article III \nstanding.  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 169 (internal quotation \nmarks and emphasis omitted).  It also noted that the \nbar on standing for injuries caused by independent ac-\ntion does not \u201cexclude injury produced by determina-\ntive or coercive effect\u201d of a government action on the \nchoices of a third party.  Id.  Bennett thus confirms the \ncommon-sense proposition that a petitioner is not nec-\nessarily foreclosed from establishing redressability \njust because a third party is \u201cthe very last step in the \n\n \n29 \n \nchain of causation.\u201d  Id.; see also Lujan, 504 U.S. at \n562. \nBut Bennett hardly supports petitioners\u2019 sweeping \ntheory that redressability is automatically established \nwhenever a challenger simply asserts some \u201cregula-\ntory impediment\u201d (Pet. Br. 25) to the use of its product.  \nTo the contrary, the Court\u2019s decision underscores how \nmuch the particular facts of a case matter.  In Bennett, \nranchers and irrigation districts challenged a Fish and \nWildlife Service biological opinion that proposed min-\nimum water levels for a water project.  But a third \nparty (the Bureau of Reclamation) \u201cretain[ed] ulti-\nmate responsibility\u201d for deciding whether to adopt the \nproposal.  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 168.  With respect to \ncausation and redressability, the main question was \nwhether the Bureau would in fact feel constrained to \ndo what the Service suggested.   \nScrutinizing the facts before it, the Court deter-\nmined that\u2014\u201cin reality\u201d\u2014the biological opinion would \nhave a \u201cdeterminative or coercive effect\u201d on the Bu-\nreau\u2019s action.  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 169.  Although the \nopinion was theoretically advisory, the Service had \nacknowledged \u201cthe virtually determinative effect of its \nbiological opinions.\u201d  Id. at 170.  And the Solicitor Gen-\neral conceded that this particular opinion would have \n\u201ca powerful coercive effect\u201d on the Bureau.  Id. at 169.  \nBefore the opinion, the Bureau had operated the water \nproject \u201cin the same manner throughout the 20th cen-\ntury.\u201d  Id. at 170.  But the Bureau had notified the \nService that in the future it \u201cintended to act in accord-\nance with\u201d the recommendations in the Service\u2019s opin-\nion.16  Those facts showed that the opinion (not some \n \n16 Resp. Br., Bennett v. Spear, No. 95-813 (U.S.), 1996 WL 396714, \n(continued\u2026) \n\n \n30 \n \nother motivation) would cause the Bureau to alter its \nbehavior.  And they allowed the Court to hold that pe-\ntitioners\u2019 injury would \u201c\u2018likely\u2019 be redressed\u2014i.e., the \nBureau will not impose [the] water level restrictions\u2014\nif the Biological Opinion is set aside.\u201d  Bennett, 520 \nU.S. at 170-171.   \nThe other cases invoked by petitioners featured \nsimilar factual assessments.  In Pierce v. Society of the \nSisters of the Holy Names of Jesus & Mary, 268 U.S. \n510 (1925), the law prohibiting parents from sending \ntheir children to private schools had \u201ccaused the with-\ndrawal from [the plaintiff\u2019s] schools of children who \nwould otherwise continue.\u201d  Id. at 532 (emphasis \nadded).  In CBS, Inc. v. United States, 316 U.S. 407, \n414, 423 (1942), an affidavit from the plaintiff radio \nnetwork made clear that radio stations were in fact \n\u201ccancelling or threatening to cancel their contracts in \norder to conform to\u201d the challenged regulations.  And \nin Northeastern Florida Chapter of Associated General \nContractors v. City of Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656, 668 \n(1993), standing rested on petitioner\u2019s allegation that \nits members \u201cregularly bid on construction contracts\u201d \nand \u201cwould have bid on contracts\u201d unavailable to them \ndue to the challenged program \u201cwere they so able.\u201d  Be-\ncause those allegations \u201cha[d] not been challenged,\u201d \nthe Court \u201cassum[ed] that they [were] true.\u201d  Id. at \n668-669.17   \n \nat *27 n.14 (July 15, 1996); see also id. at *8; Bennett v. Plenert, \n1993 WL 669429, at *3 (D. Or. Nov. 18, 1993). \n17 Because of the nature of the equal protection right at issue in \nNortheastern Florida, the companies did not need to show that \nthird parties would have selected their bids\u2014just that the com-\npanies were unable to compete on an equal basis.  See, e.g., Gratz \nv. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 244, 262 (2003). \n\n \n31 \n \nNone of those cases supports a categorical rule ex-\ncusing anyone who sells a product from the obligation \nto establish redressability when challenging a regula-\ntion implicating the use of that product.  And the pos-\nture of cases like Bennett and CBS only underscores \nthe deficiency of petitioners\u2019 showing here.  The peti-\ntioners in those cases sought to survive a motion to \ndismiss, and therefore had the \u201crelatively modest\u201d \nburden of advancing \u201c\u2018general factual allegations\u2019\u201d on \nthe elements of standing.  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 168, \n171; see CBS, 316 U.S. at 414, 423; cf. Ne. Fla., 508 \nU.S. at 668-669.  Here, petitioners were seeking to ob-\ntain a final judgment.  So they needed to \u201c\u2018set forth\u2019 by \naffidavit or other evidence \u2018specific facts\u2019\u201d demonstrat-\ning that vacatur would likely redress their injury.  \nBennett, 520 U.S. at 168; see Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.  \nNo amount of after-the-fact theorizing can excuse \ntheir failure to do so.   \nFor similar reasons, Energy Future Coalition v. \nEPA, 793 F.3d 141 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (Kavanaugh, J.), \ndoes not establish standing here.  That case involved \nethanol producers who sought to challenge an EPA \nregulation prohibiting automakers from using fuel \ncontaining 30% ethanol when testing new vehicles.  Id. \nat 143-144.  The court of appeals observed that stand-\ning can be shown where judicial relief \u201cwould remove \na regulatory hurdle\u201d to the use of a petitioner\u2019s prod-\nuct.  Id. at 144; see Pet. Br. 4, 13, 28, 29, 36.  But that \nwas the starting point for the court\u2019s analysis\u2014not the \nfinish line.  Unlike the petitioners here, the challeng-\ners in Energy Future submitted a detailed standing \nanalysis, which included an economist\u2019s explanation of \nhow the regulated parties would react to the sought-\n\n \n32 \n \nafter change.18  The court was therefore able to focus \non actual record evidence establishing \u201csubstantial \nreason to think that at least some vehicle manufactur-\ners would use\u201d the fuel in testing if the challenged reg-\nulation were eliminated.  Energy Future, 793 F.3d at \n144; see also id. at 144 (describing comments from \nFord Motor Company).  And the court expressly dis-\ntinguished the case before it from a case (like this one) \nin which studies and other \u201cobjective evidence directly \nundermined petitioners\u2019 theory of standing.\u201d  Id. at \n145 n.2. \n2. Petitioners\u2019 rule would violate basic \nprinciples of Article III standing \nThat focus on the particular circumstances of the \ncase, and the allegations and evidence before the \ncourt, is compelled by core requirements of Article III. \na.  Federal courts may not exercise jurisdiction \nbased on assumptions or speculation.  See, e.g., Clap-\nper, 568 U.S. at 414; Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better \nEnv\u2019t, 523 U.S. 83, 94 (1998).  After the pleading stage, \nthey must assure themselves that standing exists by \nexamining \u201c\u2018specific facts\u2019\u201d and \u201cevidence\u201d introduced \nby the plaintiff.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561; see All. for \nHippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 384 (noting the \u201cheavily \nfact-dependent\u201d nature of the inquiry).  That obliga-\ntion takes on added significance when the circum-\nstances of a case (or evidence submitted by the \nopposing party) create serious doubts about one of the \nelements of standing.  See generally Hertz Corp., 559 \nU.S. at 96-97. \n \n18 See Pet. Br., Energy Future, No. 14-1123, 2014 WL 5035232, at \n*29-41 (D.C. Cir. Oct. 8, 2014). \n\n \n33 \n \nTo be sure, \u201cthe nature and extent of facts that \nmust be\u201d submitted by a party seeking to challenge \ngovernment action \u201cdepends considerably\u201d on the sur-\nrounding circumstances.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.  A \nplaintiff who is directly regulated by the challenged \naction, for example, may only need to submit evidence \nshowing that it is an object of that regulation, and that \nit would engage in activities proscribed by the regula-\ntion if it were allowed to do so.  Supra p. 16.  Similarly, \nif the action prohibits other companies from using the \nplaintiff\u2019s product, causation and redressability may \nfollow from basic evidence that the plaintiff sells the \nproduct and third-party companies would have used it \nabsent the regulation.  See, e.g., Energy Future, 793 \nF.3d at 144. \nBut observations about the ease of satisfying evi-\ndentiary requirements in certain types of cases do not \namount to a categorical legal rule that \u201csuffices to es-\ntablish redressability\u201d absent evidence.  Pet. Br. 17.  \nAs this Court has explained, presumptions run \nagainst jurisdiction\u2014not in favor of it.  See, e.g., Renne \nv. Geary, 501 U.S. 312, 316 (1991) (\u201cWe presume that \nfederal courts lack jurisdiction unless the contrary ap-\npears affirmatively from the record.\u201d (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted)); see also Kokkonen, 511 U.S. at \n377.   \nA court must therefore examine the facts and evi-\ndence to determine whether\u2014\u201cin reality\u201d\u2014a judgment \naddressing a challenged government action would \nlikely redress a plaintiff\u2019s asserted injury.  Bennett, \n520 U.S. at 169.  For example, if a regulation makes it \nunlawful \u201cfor soda manufacturers to use sugar,\u201d En-\nergy Future, 793 F.3d at 144, a plaintiff may establish \nstanding by pointing to the regulation and introducing \n\n \n34 \n \nevidence that it sells sugar and that some sodas con-\ntain sugar.  But not every case will be that \u201csimple\u201d \n(Pet. Br. 47).  If the regulation instead made it unlaw-\nful only for soda manufacturers to sell more than 80% \nof their beverages with sugar, and the administrative \nrecord established that sugar-free sodas already rep-\nresented 30% of the market before the regulation, that \nplaintiff would have to do more to establish redressa-\nbility. \nAs discussed above, petitioners\u2019 case does not re-\nsemble the \u201csimple\u201d scenarios, primarily because no \none challenged EPA\u2019s initial decision to grant a waiver \nin 2013.  In the ensuing decade, automakers made \nenormous investments in zero-emission vehicles and \nconsumer tastes evolved.  By May 2022, it was not at \nall clear that the presence or absence of the Advanced \nClean Cars I standards would have a determinative or \ncoercive effect on the mix of cars sold by automakers.  \nSee supra pp. 20-22.  Market forces and internal goals \nwere pushing automakers to continue their shift to-\nward electric vehicles, regardless of California\u2019s regu-\nlations.  Pet. App. 24a n.8.  Those circumstances \ndemanded actual evidence showing redressability\u2014\nnot unsupported assertions about \u201ccommon sense and \nbasic economics.\u201d  Pet. Br. 30. \nb.  Petitioners\u2019 contrary arguments demonstrate a \nmisunderstanding of this Court\u2019s precedent.  It is true \n(Pet. Br. 27) that redressability involves \u201cthe relation-\nship between \u2018the judicial relief requested\u2019 and the \u2018in-\njury\u2019 suffered.\u201d  California v. Texas, 593 U.S. 659, 671 \n(2021).  But the necessary relationship is lacking \nwhere the plaintiff fails to prove that \u201cdepress[ed] \nmarket demand\u201d for its product in fact \u201cflows from\u201d \n(Pet. Br. 27) the challenged regulation, and that vaca-\ntur would likely lead to increased demand. \n\n \n35 \n \nPetitioners also contend that, \u201c[a]s far as redressa-\nbility is concerned, . . . Article III\u2019s demands are the \nsame whether the plaintiff is directly or indirectly reg-\nulated.\u201d  Pet. Br. 27.  Justice Scalia long ago rejected \nthat notion in an opinion for the Court.  When a plain-\ntiff is not the direct object of the government action it \nchallenges, \u201cstanding is not precluded, but it is ordi-\nnarily \u2018substantially more difficult\u2019 to establish.\u201d  \nLujan, 504 U.S. at 562.  That is because the plaintiff \nmust \u201cadduce facts\u201d creating a likelihood that the \nthird parties who are directly regulated will make \n\u201cchoices . . . in such manner as to produce causation \nand permit redressability of injury.\u201d  Id.  Petitioners \ndid not do so here. \n3. Petitioners\u2019 policy arguments do not \njustify their rule \nPetitioners eventually resort to a series of \u201cpolicy\u201d \narguments.  Pet. Br. 41; see id. at 41-45.  They first \nargue that the decision below effectively \u201crequire[s] \nthe endorsement of a directly regulated third party be-\nfore an indirectly regulated party can sue.\u201d  Id. at 38.  \nThat would be a problem, they contend, because di-\nrectly regulated entities often will be unwilling or un-\nable to assist indirectly affected challengers.  See id. \nat 42.  But the court of appeals did not require peti-\ntioners to \u201cprovid[e] affidavits from automakers\u201d as a \ncondition of standing.  Id. at 38.  The court\u2019s opinion \nshowed a willingness to consider a variety of other ma-\nterials (if identified by the parties), including com-\nments in the administrative record and public \nstatements from industry participants.  See Pet. App. \n23a-24a, 28a.   \nAnd there are a range of evidentiary sources be-\nyond \u201caffidavits from automakers\u201d that bear on how \nautomakers would likely respond to a vacatur in 2022.  \n\n \n36 \n \nThe state respondents gathered facts relevant to \nstanding from public databases, news articles, securi-\nties and court filings, government reports, and corpo-\nrate announcements.  See, e.g., J.A. 190-206.  Just a \nfew days after the oral argument caused petitioners to \ntake the jurisdictional questions seriously, petitioners \nlocated retired auto executives to file supplemental \ndeclarations that purported to speak authoritatively \nabout automakers\u2019 capabilities and practices.  See J.A. \n213, 218.19  In similar contexts, other litigants have \nrelied on a variety of sources.  See, e.g., C.A. Ohio Br. \nAdd. 37-54 (economist\u2019s declaration); Duke Pwr. Co. v. \nCarolina Envt\u2019l Study Grp., Inc., 438 U.S. 59, 75-76 \n(1978) (congressional testimony); Competitive Enter. \nInst. v. FCC, 970 F.3d 372, 383 (D.C. Cir. 2020) (ex-\npert\u2019s analysis); Competitive Enter. Inst. v. NHTSA, \n901 F.2d 107, 117 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (testimony from ad-\nministrative hearing).   \nThe decision below thus does not \u201ccreat[e] artifi-\ncially high evidentiary barriers.\u201d  Pet. Br. 35.  And it \ndoes not obstruct \u201csuits by unregulated plaintiffs who \nare adversely affected by an agency\u2019s regulation of oth-\ners.\u201d  Corner Post, Inc. v. Bd. of Governors of Fed. Rsrv. \nSys., 603 U.S. 799, 826 (2024) (Kavanaugh, J., concur-\nring).  It simply ensures that any such suits are \n \n19 Those declarations are not before this Court because the court \nof appeals held that petitioners failed to establish good cause for \ntheir untimely filing, see Pet. App. 31a-32a, and petitioners did \nnot seek review of that ruling, see Pet. I; State Opp. 14-15.  In any \nevent, the declarants did not account for 2022 market conditions.  \nSee J.A. 213-222.  As to redressability, they merely asserted that \nautomakers \u201clikely would change their production, pricing, \nand/or distribution plans for Model Year 2025\u201d absent Califor-\nnia\u2019s standards.  J.A. 215, 220.  They offered no supporting de-\ntails, and focused instead on the distinct question of how quickly \nautomakers could change their fleets and prices. \n\n \n37 \n \nbrought by plaintiffs who are, in fact, adversely af-\nfected by the challenged action and would benefit from \na favorable decision.     \nNext, petitioners argue that the \u201cdecision below \ncreates troubling incentives for agencies.\u201d  Pet. Br. 43.  \nThey assert that agencies may now \u201ctarget entire in-\ndustries with crippling burdens so long as they act \nthrough a conduit and placate that conduit.\u201d  Id.20  \nAgain, however, a plaintiff whose sales are crippled as \nthe result of an agency action can invoke numerous \nsources to demonstrate a likelihood that vacatur \nwould increase sales.  Nor does this case present any \nvalid concern about \u201cencourag[ing] agencies to act over \nshorter time horizons.\u201d  Pet. Br. 44.  The underlying \nwaiver was granted in 2013 and addressed standards \nthat increased in stringency through model year 2025.  \nAny jurisdictional difficulties petitioners confronted \nresulted primarily from their own choice not to chal-\nlenge the original 2013 action.  See supra p. 18 n.7. \nFinally, petitioners argue that the court of appeals \n\u201ccreate[d] a one-way ratchet in favor of the regulator \nover the regulated\u201d by requiring petitioners to intro-\nduce evidence of standing.  Pet. Br. 44.  They contrast \nthat requirement with the principle that \u201c[a] State will \n \n20 Petitioners note that several automakers entered voluntary \nagreements with California in 2020 to continue producing more \nlow- and zero-emission vehicles.  See Pet. App. 13a-14a.  But that \nwas not a \u201ctroubling\u201d effort by EPA to \u201cinsulate\u201d the \u201centire in-\ndustr[y]\u201d from \u201creview.\u201d  Pet. Br. 43.  And petitioners \nacknowledge that \u201cmany\u201d other automakers did not enter any \nsuch agreement.  Id. at 37.  Nothing prevented petitioners from \nattempting to introduce evidence showing that the non-partici-\npating automakers would likely change their fleets in response to \na vacatur of the reinstatement. \n\n \n38 \n \nalways have \u2018a legitimate interest in the continued en-\nforceability of its own statutes.\u2019\u201d  Id. (quoting Maine v. \nTaylor, 477 U.S. 131, 137 (1986)).  But state plaintiffs \ndo introduce evidence where necessary to show that a \nfavorable judgment would redress their injuries.  See, \ne.g., Dep\u2019t of Com., 588 U.S. at 767-768.  And this \nCourt\u2019s recognition that sovereigns have a protectable \ninterest in effectuating their own statutes hardly \namounts to \u201cbad policy.\u201d  Pet. Br. 41; see Maryland v. \nKing, 567 U.S. 1301, 1303 (2012) (Roberts, C.J., in \nchambers); Maine, 477 U.S. at 137. \nThe more relevant policy consideration is the one \nunderlying Article III:  that federal courts have lim-\nited jurisdiction, and a party seeking to invoke that \njurisdiction must show that its claim falls within those \nlimits.  That policy, which reflects the Framers\u2019 vision \nof the proper role of courts in our democratic system, \nsee All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 380, requires \naffirmance here.   \nB. Unsupported Predictions About the Effect \nof a Judgment on a Third Party Are Insuf-\nficient to Establish Redressability \nPetitioners\u2019 alternative theory for why they did not \nneed to introduce evidence of redressability fails for \nsimilar reasons.  They contend that plaintiffs can es-\ntablish standing simply by asserting that the \u201ceffects \nof the challenged government action on third parties\u201d \nare \u201cpredictable\u201d\u2014and that \u201cno more is needed.\u201d  Pet. \nBr. 18.  The cases petitioners invoke for that argument \nactually demonstrate the opposite.   \nPetitioners portray Department of Commerce as \nholding that unsupported inferences and predictions \nabout \u201cthird-party behavior . . . can suffice\u201d to estab-\nlish standing.  Pet. Br. 30; see id. at 31.  In truth, that \ndecision examined whether the plaintiffs \u201cha[d] met \n\n \n39 \n \ntheir burden of showing that third parties will likely \nreact in predictable ways\u201d to a citizenship question on \nthe 2020 census, and thereby cause harm to the plain-\ntiffs.  Dep\u2019t of Com., 588 U.S. at 768 (emphasis added).  \nThe Court answered that question in the affirmative \nonly after reviewing the district court\u2019s \u201cfindings of \nfact\u201d\u2014based on extensive \u201cevidence\u201d\u2014which \u201cestab-\nlished a sufficient likelihood that the reinstatement of \na citizenship question\u201d would depress census response \nrates.  Id. at 767; see New York v. Dep\u2019t of Com., 351 F. \nSupp. 3d 502, 578-581 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (describing ex-\npert testimony, statistical data, and agency memo-\nranda).  The Court did not rely on \u201cspeculation\u201d or \npredictions alone.  Dep\u2019t of Com., 588 U.S. at 768.21 \nNor can petitioners dismiss the significance of the \nevidence before the Court in Department of Commerce \non the ground that it merely recounted \u201chistorical \npractice.\u201d  Pet. Br. 31.  The plaintiffs in that case did \nnot just reference the result of questions on prior cen-\nsuses.  They introduced detailed evidence that \u201cover-\nwhelmingly support[ed] the conclusion that the \naddition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census \nwill cause a significant net differential decline in self-\nresponse rates among noncitizen households.\u201d  New \nYork, 351 F. Supp. 3d at 578 (emphasis added). \nThe remaining authorities discussed by petitioners \n(Pet. Br. 31) do not advance their theory either.  The \nstanding analysis in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. \n497, 526 (2007), turned on evidence that included \u201cpe-\ntitioners\u2019 uncontested affidavits.\u201d  That evidence \n \n21 See also California, 593 U.S. at 678 (explaining that the plain-\ntiffs in Department of Commerce \u201crelied not only on \u2018the predict-\nable effect of Government action on the decisions of third parties\u2019 \nbut also on comprehensive studies, rather than mere \u2018specula-\ntion\u2019\u201d). \n\n \n40 \n \nshowed that \u201cthe United States transportation sector \nemit[ted] . . .  more than 6% of worldwide carbon diox-\nide emissions,\u201d id. at 524; that there was \u201ca causal con-\nnection between manmade greenhouse gas emissions \nand global warming,\u201d id. at 523, see id. at 525; and \nthat \u201c[a] reduction in domestic emissions\u201d resulting \nfrom the requested relief \u201cwould slow the pace of \nglobal emissions increases,\u201d providing partial redress \nfor petitioners\u2019 undisputed injuries, id. at 526; see id. \nat 522-523.22  In Skyline Wesleyan Church v. Califor-\nnia Department of Managed Health Care, 968 F.3d \n738, 750 (9th Cir. 2020), the plaintiff similarly offered \n\u201cevidence\u201d that regulatory enforcement had caused \nhealth insurers to abandon restrictions on abortion \ncoverage.  Specifically, \u201cseven insurers had offered \nplans with abortion coverage restrictions\u201d consistent \nwith plaintiff\u2019s religious beliefs, then \u201call seven com-\nplied\u201d with a regulator\u2019s warning to stop offering such \nplans.  Id. at 750.  Both decisions thus turned on ac-\ntual evidence, not unsupported predictions. \nPetitioners nonetheless advance a blanket rule \nthat no evidence is required if \u201cthe behavior of third \nparties is predictable rather than speculative.\u201d  Pet. \nBr. 30.  They further contend that only \u201cthree \ncircumstances\u201d exist in which third-party behavior is \nsufficiently speculative to require evidence of redress-\nability:  (i) where a plaintiff\u2019s theory relies on \u201c\u2018coun-\nterintuitive\u2019 assumptions,\u201d  id. at 32 (citing California, \n593 U.S. at 678); (ii) where it relies on an attenuated \n\u201cchain of events,\u201d Pet. Br. 32 (citing All. for Hippo-\ncratic Med., 602 U.S. at 386); and (iii) where the \u201clegal \nimpact of a judicial decision is unclear,\u201d Pet. Br. 33 \n \n22 The Court also accorded a \u201cspecial solicitude\u201d to the state peti-\ntioners, which does not apply to the private petitioners here.  \nMassachusetts, 549 U.S. at 520. \n\n \n41 \n \n(citing Murthy, 603 U.S. at 72-73, Brackeen, 599 U.S. \nat 294, and Texas, 599 U.S. at 691 (Gorsuch, J., con-\ncurring in the judgment)). \nThose arguments profoundly misunderstand this \nCourt\u2019s standing doctrine.  Challengers must always \nidentify \u201cevidence\u201d proving \u201c\u2018specific facts\u2019\u201d that estab-\nlish standing.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561; see FW/PBS, \nInc. v. City of Dallas, 493 U.S. 215, 231 (1990).  And \nthis Court\u2019s analysis of standing is \u201cnot a \u2018mechanical \nexercise\u2019\u201d\u2014particularly when it comes to suits (like \nthis one) \u201cby unregulated parties against the govern-\nment.\u201d  All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 384.  In \nsome cases, \u201cfamiliar circumstances\u201d make standing \n\u201clikely,\u201d id., and a plaintiff might be able to meet its \nburden with less evidence.  In other cases, like those \nreferenced by petitioners, the Court has pointed to cir-\ncumstances calling for \u201cfar stronger evidence\u201d of cau-\nsation and redressability.  E.g., California, 593 U.S. at \n678.  But those circumstances are not the only ones in \nwhich plaintiffs are required to introduce any evi-\ndence.  \nPetitioners\u2019 own arguments illustrate the folly of \ntheir proposed rule.  Invoking Summers v. Earth Is-\nland Institute, 555 U.S. 488, 494 (2009), petitioners ar-\ngue (Pet. Br. 34) that \u201cit is predictable that when the \ngovernment \u2018regulates parks, national forests, or bod-\nies of water,\u2019 it will affect the users of those natural \nresources.\u201d  \u201cIn all such cases,\u201d id., petitioners assert, \nno \u201c[r]ecord evidence is required,\u201d id. at 30.  But Sum-\nmers held exactly the opposite.  It reiterated that a \nplaintiff \u201cbears the burden of showing that he has \nstanding.\u201d  Summers, 555 U.S. at 493.  The Court in-\nsisted on particular evidence showing that the chal-\nlenged regulations would affect a specific site that at \nleast one of plaintiffs\u2019 members had \u201ca specific and \n\n \n42 \n \nconcrete plan\u201d to visit.  Id. at 495.  And it rejected a \n\u201chitherto unheard-of test\u201d that would premise stand-\ning on a \u201cprobability\u201d that \u201csome (unidentified) mem-\nbers have planned to visit some (unidentified) small \nparcels affected by the Forest Service\u2019s procedures and \nwill suffer (unidentified) concrete harm as a result.\u201d  \nId. at 497-498.  That sort of predictive approach\u2014un-\nsupported by concrete evidence\u2014would \u201cmake a mock-\nery of\u201d the Court\u2019s \u201cprior cases.\u201d  Id. at 498. \nC. The Duration of the Waiver Does Not, By \nItself, Establish Standing \nPetitioners also contend that they were excused \nfrom submitting evidence because the \u201cwaiver for cer-\ntain California standards does not sunset.\u201d  Pet. Br. \n19.  But the fact that the greenhouse-gas standards \nplateau starting in model year 2025, and continue at \nthe same levels in future years, supra p. 6, does not \nchange the analysis.   \n1.  Petitioners reason that because those standards \n\u201cdo not expire,\u201d a judicial vacatur \u201cwould necessarily \nhave some effect on vehicle pricing, production, or dis-\ntribution at some future point.\u201d  Pet. Br. 46 (emphasis \nadded).  This Court has previously rejected that kind \nof reasoning.  See Summers, 555 U.S. at 496 (state-\nments of \u201c\u2018some day\u2019 intentions,\u201d without \u201cany specifi-\ncation of when the some day will be,\u201d are insufficient \nto establish standing); Lujan, 504 U.S. at 564 (same).  \nAnd for good reason.  Statutes and regulations often \ndo not sunset.  The mere longevity of a challenged reg-\nulation is no substitute for \u201cspecific, concrete facts \ndemonstrating that\u201d the plaintiff is harmed by the \ngovernment\u2019s action and \u201cpersonally would benefit in \na tangible way from the court\u2019s intervention.\u201d  Warth, \n422 U.S. at 508. \n\n \n43 \n \nIn this case, moreover, the facts belie petitioners\u2019 \nassertion (Pet. Br. 19) that the duration of the green-\nhouse-gas standards eliminates any \u201cplausible dis-\npute\u201d about redressability.  By the time of this suit, \nsales of battery-electric vehicles far exceeded original \nforecasts, and those vehicles generate an outsized \nnumber of ZEV credits and produce very few green-\nhouse-gas emissions.  See supra pp. 6, 21-22.  Petition-\ners did not submit any evidence that the market would \nreverse course if those standards were no longer in \nplace in future years.  See supra p. 25. \nNor does the court of appeals\u2019 apparent misunder-\nstanding about the temporal scope of the greenhouse-\ngas standards (Pet. Br. 45) compel a different outcome.  \nThe court of appeals lacked jurisdiction because peti-\ntioners failed to introduce evidence showing that au-\ntomakers would likely respond to vacatur by \u201cselling \nfewer non-conventional vehicles or by altering the \nprices of their vehicles such that fewer non-conven-\ntional vehicles\u2014and more conventional vehicles\u2014\nwere sold.\u201d  Pet. App. 22a; see id. at 29a-30a.  The \ncourt\u2019s belief that the challenge before it \u201cconcern[ed] \nonly\u201d the reinstatement of the waiver \u201cas to Model \nYears 2017 through 2025,\u201d was a consideration that \n\u201cfurther complicated\u201d the redressability analysis.  Id. \nat 22a (emphasis added); see id. at 24a.  Setting aside \nthat additional perceived complication does not make \nup for petitioners\u2019 failure to introduce any evidence ad-\ndressing how automakers would likely respond to a \nvacatur in May 2022.  See U.S. Opp. 12-14. \n2.  Relatedly, petitioners fault EPA and the court \nof appeals for the court\u2019s \u201cincorrect\u201d premise about the \nduration of the waiver, Pet. Br. 45, which they contend \ncaused the court to improperly \u201cconflate[] mootness \n\n \n44 \n \nand redressability,\u201d id. at 39.  Those arguments are \npuzzling. \nIt has never been a secret that California\u2019s \u201cgreen-\nhouse-gas emission standards applied to model year \n2025 \u2018and subsequent.\u2019\u201d  Pet. Br. 45-46 (quoting J.A. \n50).  That was plainly described in the California Code \nof Regulations. See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \n\u00a7 1961.3(a)(1)(A); see also Cal. Code Regs., tit. 13, \n\u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2012) (similar wording in originally \nenacted ZEV provision).  Petitioners imply that the \nlower court\u2019s confusion about the duration of the \nwaiver arose because EPA failed to \u201ccandidly ex-\nplain[]\u201d the matter until the certiorari stage.  Pet. Br. \n45; see id. at 46.  But the more likely culprit was peti-\ntioners\u2019 opening brief below, which told the court that \npetitioners were challenging a program \u201ccover[ing] ve-\nhicles from model years 2015 through 2025.\u201d  C.A. Pri-\nvate Pet. Br. 9; see also C.A. Oral Arg. 33:55-34:13 \n(argument of petitioners\u2019 counsel that, to defeat stand-\ning, \u201cthe Government would need to come forward \nwith some evidence that [automakers have] now \nplanned around the restatement in a way that couldn\u2019t \nbe withdrawn by 2025\u201d). \nThe lack of clarity on this point was perhaps un-\nderstandable:  petitioners\u2019 central focus in this case \nhas always been on the ZEV standards, which will ex-\npire after model year 2025.  Pet. Br. 46.  That may be \nwhy petitioners urged this Court to resolve the merits \nof their statutory claim before \u201cCalifornia\u2019s waiver ex-\npires at the end of model year 2025,\u201d Pet. 26, even af-\nter they had belatedly acknowledged that the \ngreenhouse-gas standards apply to \u201cModel Years \n\u20182025 and subsequent,\u2019\u201d C.A. Private Pet. Proposed \nSupp. Br. 5.  But whatever the source of the confusion \n\n \n45 \n \nbelow, it did not matter to the ultimate outcome.  Re-\ngardless of the waiver\u2019s duration, petitioners failed to \nshow that automakers would respond to its reinstate-\nment (either sooner or later) by making changes that \nwould increase fuel sales.   \nIn the face of that failure, the court of appeals cor-\nrectly explained why its decision was based on stand-\ning, not mootness:  The jurisdictional problem was not \nthat petitioners\u2019 \u201cstanding arguments were sufficient \nwhen originally filed\u201d and then were \u201cmooted by the \npassage of time.\u201d  Pet. App. 25a; see generally Already, \nLLC v. Nike, Inc., 568 U.S. 85, 91 (2013).  Petitioners\u2019 \n\u201cstanding arguments were deficient from the start.\u201d  \nPet. App. 25a.  By the time petitioners filed their chal-\nlenge in May 2022, shifts in consumer demand and \nother transformations in the market made it specula-\ntive (at best) that vacating the reinstatement would \nlead to increased fuel sales in the future.  Petitioners \nnever even attempted to introduce evidence demon-\nstrating that vacatur of the reinstatement would have \nthe effects on automakers that they predicted.  Pet. \nApp. 29a-30a.   \nD. Petitioners\u2019 Post Hoc Attempts to Identify \nEvidence on Redressability Fail to Estab-\nlish Standing \nFinally, petitioners argue that if they \u201cwere legally \nrequired to produce record evidence to support re-\ndressability, plenty such evidence existed.\u201d  Pet. \nBr. 37.  But the few documents that petitioners cited \nin the court of appeals did not establish any likelihood \nthat a vacatur in 2022 would increase fuel sales, as \ndetailed in Part I.C above.  And the additional materi-\nals petitioners now point this Court to would not have \nestablished redressability even if petitioners had in-\nvoked them in a timely fashion below. \n\n \n46 \n \nPetitioners first highlight (Pet. Br. 38) a statement \nfrom an appendix to California\u2019s 2021 comment letter \nregarding the reinstatement.  See J.A. 84.  But that \nstatement relied on forecasts from 2017.  See J.A. 85 \nn.17 (citing January 2017 analysis of regulation com-\npliance scenarios); id. at 85 n.18 (citing February 2017 \nmodeling scenario).  By 2022, the earlier projections \nhad been overtaken by actual events.  See J.A. 191 (na-\ntional market share of zero-emission vehicles \u201calmost \ntripled\u201d in the period \u201cbetween 2020 and the third \nquarter of 2022\u201d). \nPetitioners also invoke declarations that the state \nrespondents filed along with their motion to intervene, \nshortly after petitioners initiated this suit.  See Pet. \nBr. 13, 34.  Those declarations (like petitioners\u2019) as-\nserted a conclusory \u201cexpect[ation]\u201d that additional \ngasoline-fueled vehicles would be sold if California\u2019s \nstandards were not in place.  J.A. 110, 111; see id. at \n115-116.  The lack of any details or contemporaneous \nevidence for those assertions reflected both time con-\nstraints (the intervention declarations were signed \nfour days after the case commenced) and the reality \nthat the States\u2019 standing and entitlement to intervene \nwere independently established for other reasons.  Cf. \nKing, 567 U.S. at 1303 (reasoning that a State suffers \n\u201congoing irreparable harm\u201d any time it \u201cis enjoined by \na court from effectuating . . . a duly enacted statute\u201d). \nAnother document referenced by petitioners (Pet. \nBr. 47) is outside the record and post-dates the deci-\nsion below:  EPA\u2019s recent request for public comment \non its proposal to incorporate the greenhouse-gas \nstandards of the Advanced Clean Cars I program into \nCalifornia\u2019s state implementation plan.  See 89 Fed. \nReg. 82,553 (Oct. 11, 2024); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7407.  To be \nsure, the underlying state estimates referenced in that \n\n \n47 \n \nproposal (see 89 Fed. Reg. at 82,557 & nn.19-20) are \npart of the record, because California submitted them \nto EPA in 2021 in connection with the reinstatement \nproceedings.  See C.A. J.A. 276.  But petitioners never \ninvoked those submissions below.  And the estimates \ntook as their baseline a projection of zero-emission ve-\nhicle penetration based on 2019 data, which did not \nanticipate the dramatic increase in sales in the follow-\ning years.23   \nNone of the materials that petitioners belatedly \nreference could have satisfied their burden to submit \nevidence about how the market would respond to va-\ncatur of the reinstatement in May 2022.  And the fact \nthat they were not \u201cset forth\u201d as \u201cthe basis for the \nclaim of standing\u201d below poses another insuperable \nobstacle for petitioners.  D.C. Cir. R. 28(a)(7).  As this \nCourt recently reminded litigants, \u201c\u2018judges are not like \npigs, hunting for truffles buried in the record.\u2019\u201d  \nMurthy, 603 U.S. at 67 n.7 (alterations omitted).  The \ncourt of appeals could not reasonably be expected to \nfocus on a few sentences scattered across thousands of \npages of record materials, which were never raised in \npetitioners\u2019 briefs.  Nor could it be expected to recall \nisolated assertions in two declarations, filed in support \nof one of five unopposed motions to intervene, that \nwere disposed of by the Clerk more than a year before \noral argument.  See C.A. Order (June 30, 2022). \nIn the end, petitioners are right that this case is \n\u201csimple\u201d (Pet. Br. 47)\u2014but not in the way they sug-\ngest.  They had the burden to introduce evidence es-\ntablishing that their claim was redressable.  Instead \n \n23  See C.A. J.A. 277 (explaining reliance on \u201cEMFAC 2021\u201d \nmodel); Cal. Air Res. Bd., EMFAC 2021 Volume III Technical \nDocument, at 6 (April 2021), https://tinyurl.com/2wsxz4uy (ex-\nplaining use of DMV data through 2019). \n\n \n48 \n \nof meeting that obligation head-on, they treated re-\ndressability as an afterthought\u2014relying on assump-\ntions and conclusory assertions, supplemented only by \noutdated projections.  And when confronted with cur-\nrent evidence from the state respondents undermining \ntheir assumption that vacatur of the reinstatement in \nMay 2022 would lead to increased fuel sales, petition-\ners offered no evidentiary response.  Because petition-\ners failed to introduce specific facts and evidence \nestablishing a likelihood of redressability, the court of \nappeals properly held that it could not reach the mer-\nits. \n\n \n49 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be af-\nfirmed. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \nROB BONTA \nAttorney General of California \nMICHAEL J.

As their case progresses, they \nmust \u201cpoint to factual evidence\u201d establishing that they \nsatisfied the three elements of standing\u2014injury, cau-\nsation, and redressability\u2014as of the time they filed \nsuit.  Murthy v. Missouri, 603 U.S. 43, 57-58 (2024).  \nThe only question here is how to apply those long-set-\ntled requirements to the peculiar circumstances of this \ncase, involving a waiver of preemption under Section \n209(b) of the Clean Air Act. \nAs petitioners describe things, that question is \n\u201cstraightforward\u201d because standing is automatic here.  \nPet. Br. 35.  Petitioners profit from sales of fuel.  They \nnote that the waiver allowed California to impose \nstate standards limiting greenhouse-gas emissions \nacross automakers\u2019 fleets and requiring automakers to \nsell a certain percentage of zero-emission vehicles.  Pe-\ntitioners assert that \u201c[t]hey promptly challenged \nEPA\u2019s waiver,\u201d id. at 20; that the waiver injures peti-\ntioners and their members by \u201creduc[ing] the use of \nliquid fuel,\u201d id.; and that \u201c[s]etting aside EPA\u2019s waiver \nwould . . . end[] the artificial depression of demand for \npetitioners\u2019 products,\u201d id. at 20-21.  Standing was so \n\u201cobvious,\u201d in their view, that they did not \u201cneed to sup-\nply additional record evidence\u201d to establish redressa-\nbility.  Id. at 17, 18. \nBut \u201capplying the law of standing\u201d frequently de-\nmands a \u201cheavily fact-dependent\u201d inquiry, FDA v. All. \nfor Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 384 (2024), and pe-\ntitioners elide the most salient facts in this case.  EPA \ngranted the relevant waiver in 2013.  Petitioners did \nnot challenge that waiver and neither did anyone else.  \nIt remained in effect for more than six years before \n\n \n2 \n \nEPA withdrew it in 2019.  During those six years, in \nresponse to the state standards and wider national \nand global trends, automakers invested heavily in \nchanging their fleets and building consumer demand \nfor electric vehicles.  Consumer preferences and the \nautomobile market evolved.  Even when EPA with-\ndrew the waiver, automakers accelerated their transi-\ntion to electric vehicles and consumer demand \ncontinued to grow. \nIn 2021, when EPA invited comment on whether to \nreinstate the waiver, the state respondents supported \nreinstatement.  As their comment explained, the with-\ndrawal had exceeded EPA\u2019s authority and it deprived \nCalifornia\u2019s regulations of legal effect.  But by the time \nEPA reinstated the waiver and petitioners challenged \nthat decision in 2022, \u201c\u2018both internal sustainability \ngoals and external market forces\u2019\u201d were pushing \n\u201cmanufacturers to transition toward electric vehicles, \nirrespective of California\u2019s regulations.\u201d  Pet. App. 24a \nn.8.  Indeed, publicly available evidence submitted by \nthe state respondents showed that zero-emission vehi-\ncles sold in California in 2022 already exceeded what \nthe relevant standards required.  Consumers were \nwilling to pay substantial price premiums for those ve-\nhicles.  And automakers had strong incentives to keep \nselling them. \nWhen the court of appeals confronted petitioners\u2019 \nchallenge to the reinstatement, it had to assure itself \nof jurisdiction by evaluating whether vacatur of that \nreinstatement would likely lead automakers to make \nchoices that would redress petitioners\u2019 asserted injury.  \nGiven the circumstances when petitioners filed suit in \nMay 2022, would automakers change their fleets or \nprices in a way that would increase demand for peti-\ntioners\u2019 liquid-fuel products?  Or would automakers \n\n \n3 \n \nexceed the requirements of California\u2019s standards for \ntheir own economic and strategic reasons, even with-\nout a legal requirement to do so?  Petitioners submit-\nted no evidence addressing that critical issue.  And \ngiven that absence of proof, the court of appeals \nproperly held that petitioners failed to meet their bur-\nden of demonstrating redressability. \nPetitioners ask this Court to excuse that failure.  \nThey first urge the Court to adopt a new \u201ccategorical \nrule.\u201d  Pet. Br. 4.  Under that rule, redressability \nwould be established automatically whenever peti-\ntioners challenge a regulation that implicates the use \nof their products\u2014even if the regulation applies only \nto third parties, and even where petitioners introduce \nno evidence indicating that those third parties would \nhave acted differently in the regulation\u2019s absence.  Id.  \nIn the alternative, petitioners ask the Court to credit \ntheir unsubstantiated predictions about how au-\ntomakers might respond to a vacatur.  Id. at 30-35.  \nThose arguments find no support in this Court\u2019s prec-\nedent.  Adopting them would effectively eliminate the \nplaintiff\u2019s \u201cburden of showing that third parties will \nlikely react\u201d to a favorable judgment in a way that pro-\nvides redress.  Dep\u2019t of Com. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, \n768 (2019).  And they would allow a court to assume \nredressability even if all the evidence before it indi-\ncates that a favorable judgment would not, in fact, re-\ndress the plaintiffs\u2019 injury.  This Court should reject \npetitioners\u2019 novel standing theories and affirm the \njudgment below. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal and Regulatory Background \n1.  The Clean Air Act directs EPA to prescribe fed-\neral standards governing emissions of air pollutants \n\n \n4 \n \nfrom new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle en-\ngines.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7521.  Section 209(a) of the Act gen-\nerally preempts States and their political subdivisions \nfrom \u201cadopt[ing] or attempt[ing] to enforce any stand-\nard relating to the control of emissions from new mo-\ntor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines.\u201d  Id. \n\u00a7 7543(a).  But Section 209(b) instructs EPA to \u201cwaive \napplication of [Section 209] to any State which ha[d] \nadopted\u201d qualifying emission standards \u201cprior to \nMarch 30, 1966, if the State determines that the State \nstandards will be, in the aggregate, at least as protec-\ntive of public health and welfare as applicable Federal \nstandards.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7543(b)(1).  If a State makes that de-\ntermination, EPA must waive preemption unless it \nmakes one of three enumerated findings.  See id. \n\u00a7 7543(b)(1)(A)-(C). \nCalifornia is the only State eligible for a waiver un-\nder Section 209(b) because it was the only State that \nhad developed qualifying motor vehicle emissions \nstandards before March 30, 1966.  Pet. App. 7a.  \u201cCon-\ngress recognized that California was already the \n\u2018lead[er] in the establishment of standards for regula-\ntion of automative pollutant emissions\u2019 at a time when \nthe federal government had yet to promulgate any reg-\nulations of its own.\u201d  Engine Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 88 \nF.3d 1075, 1079 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  Congress designed \nSection 209 to allow California to continue to serve as \na \u201c\u2018laboratory for innovation,\u2019\u201d id. at 1080, while also \n\u201cavoid[ing] the economic disruption\u201d that would come \nfrom manufacturers \u201chaving to meet fifty-one separate \nsets of emission control requirements,\u201d Motor & \nEquip. Mfrs. Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. EPA, 627 F.2d 1095, 1109 \n(D.C. Cir. 1979); see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7507 (1977 \namendment allowing other States to adopt standards \n\u201cidentical to the California standards for which a \nwaiver has been granted for such model year\u201d); Pet. \n\n \n5 \n \nApp. 9a n.3 (noting that \u201cseventeen states have chosen \nto adopt some portion of the California regulations\u201d). \nCalifornia received its first waiver in 1968 and has \nreceived additional waivers in every subsequent dec-\nade.1  For instance, EPA granted a waiver in 1993 for \nCalifornia\u2019s first Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) regula-\ntion, which required a specific percentage of light-duty \nvehicles to be zero-emission vehicles with no exhaust \nor evaporative emissions.  58 Fed. Reg. 4166 (Jan. 13, \n1993).2  EPA granted another waiver, in 2009, for Cal-\nifornia\u2019s first set of regulations to control greenhouse-\ngas emissions from motor vehicles.  74 Fed. Reg. \n32,744 (July 8, 2009). \n2.  This litigation concerns a set of emissions \nstandards that California adopted in 2012 as part of \nits Advanced Clean Cars I program.  78 Fed. Reg. 2112 \n(Jan. 9, 2013).  As relevant here, those standards in-\ncluded a requirement that automakers reduce the av-\nerage greenhouse-gas emissions across the fleets of \nvehicles they sell in California.  See id. at 2114.  They \nalso included new ZEV standards, requiring manufac-\nturers to meet specified \u201cZEV credit percentage\u201d re-\nquirements.  Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(b) \n(2012).   \nA manufacturer can satisfy the \u201cZEV credit per-\ncentage\u201d in several ways:  by generating credits from \nsales of qualifying vehicles, purchasing credits from \nother manufacturers, using excess credits banked in \nprior years, or applying credits obtained by overcom-\n \n1 See EPA, Vehicle Emissions California Waivers and Authoriza-\ntions, https://tinyurl.com/3rxscztw (last visited Mar. 6, 2025). \n2  See Cal. Air Res. Bd., Low-Emission Vehicle Program,  \nhttps://tinyurl.com/49m28yze (last visited Mar. 6, 2025). \n\n \n6 \n \nplying with the greenhouse-gas emission require-\nments.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(d)(5); 78 \nFed. Reg. at 2119-2120, 2135.  The number of ZEV \ncredits generated by a vehicle sale depends on the ve-\nhicle\u2019s range when operating on electric power.  See \nCal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(d)(5).  For example, a \nplug-in hybrid vehicle with a \u201c50 mile\u201d electric range \nearns one credit, while a fully battery-electric vehicle \nwith a \u201c350 mile\u201d range earns four credits.3  As a re-\nsult, a fleet may satisfy the standards even though \nZEV sales as a percentage of light-duty vehicles sold \nis well below the applicable ZEV credit percentage re-\nquirement.  \nThe Advanced Clean Cars I standards affected \nmodel years beginning in 2017 (for greenhouse-gas \nemissions) and 2018 (for ZEV requirements).  Both \nsets of standards were originally structured to in-\ncrease in stringency through model year 2025 and re-\nmain in effect at 2025 levels for subsequent model \nyears.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1961.3(a)(1)(A) \n(2012); id. \u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2012); J.A. 50.  In 2022, \nhowever, California amended the ZEV standards (but \nnot the greenhouse-gas standards) to expire after \nmodel year 2025.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \n\u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2022).4 \n \n3 78 Fed. Reg. at 2114-2115; see Cal. Air Res. Bd., ACC II ZEV \nTechnology Assessment, at 11-12 tbl. 2 (Apr. 12, 2022) (showing \nelectric ranges of model year 2021 battery and plug-in hybrid ve-\nhicles), https://tinyurl.com/2d2db9vc (last visited Mar. 11, 2025).  \n4  California adopted that amendment because its Advanced \nClean Cars II standards included a new set of ZEV requirements \napplicable to model years 2026 and beyond.  See Cal. Code Regs. \ntit. 13, \u00a7 1962.4(a) (2022).  EPA granted a waiver for the Ad-\nvanced Clean Cars II standards on December 17, 2024.  90 Fed. \n(continued\u2026) \n\n \n7 \n \nCalifornia requested a waiver for the Advanced \nClean Cars I program in 2012.  That request described \nhow the new standards would increase production of \nzero-emission vehicles, thus decreasing emissions of \ncriteria pollutants and greenhouse gases.  J.A. 34-35, \n40-44.  EPA granted the waiver in early 2013.  78 Fed. \nReg. at 2145.  As the Federal Register notice of that \naction observed, petitions for judicial review were due \nby March 11, 2013.  Id.; see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1).  No-\nbody challenged EPA\u2019s decision to grant the waiver. \nMore than six years later, EPA withdrew the parts \nof the waiver at issue in this case.  84 Fed. Reg. 51,310 \n(Sept. 27, 2019).  By that time, automakers had made \n\u201cinvestments to meet\u201d the greenhouse-gas and ZEV \nstandards and \u201chad adjusted their fleets to comply \nwith\u201d them.  Pet. App. 12a; see id. at 124a.  Consumers \nhad grown increasingly familiar with zero-emission \nvehicles.  Even after the waiver was withdrawn, con-\nsumer demand for those vehicles continued to grow \nand automakers continued to announce plans to sell \nthem in greater numbers.  J.A. 191-192, 201-203.  By \n2020, for example, zero-emission vehicles were around \n8% of the new light-duty vehicles registered in Califor-\nnia; that figure jumped to over 12% the following \nyear.5 \nIn 2021, EPA solicited comment on whether it \nshould reinstate the waiver.  The state respondents \nsubmitted a comment in July 2021, explaining that \n \nReg. 642 (2025).  Several challenges to that waiver are now pend-\ning, including one that two of the petitioners here filed on Febru-\nary 28, 2025.

The petitioners here are various companies that \nproduce or sell liquid fuels, as well as related trade as-\nsociations.  Pet. App. 2a.  They filed petitions for re-\nview of EPA\u2019s reinstatement decision in the D.C. \nCircuit on May 12, 2022.  Id. at 15a.  The court of ap-\npeals consolidated those cases, along with another \ncase initiated by a group of States led by Ohio.  Id.  \nShortly thereafter, the state respondents here filed an \nunopposed motion for leave to intervene in support of \nEPA, as did various automakers and public-interest \norganizations.  Id. at 15a & nn.4-6; see J.A. 107.  Those \nmotions were granted.  See Pet. App. 15a. \nPetitioners principally argued that EPA\u2019s rein-\nstatement of the waiver contravened the Clean Air \nAct.  Pet. App. 16a.  Before the court of appeals could \nreach the merits of that claim, however, it had to as-\nsure itself of jurisdiction.  Under longstanding circuit \nrules, the opening brief for a petitioner seeking review \nof agency action \u201cmust set forth the basis for the claim \nof standing.\u201d  D.C. Cir. R. 28(a)(7).  And if \u201cstanding is \nnot apparent from the administrative record, the brief \nmust include arguments and evidence establishing the \n\n \n9 \n \nclaim of standing.\u201d  Id.; see also Sierra Club v. EPA, \n292 F.3d 895, 901 (D.C. Cir. 2002). \nPetitioners\u2019 opening brief below devoted just two \nparagraphs to standing.  J.A. 118-119.  Petitioners ex-\nplained that \u201cdepressing the demand\u201d for liquid fuels \n\u201cinjures petitioners and petitioners\u2019 members finan-\ncially.\u201d  Id. at 118.

As their case progresses, they \nmust \u201cpoint to factual evidence\u201d establishing that they \nsatisfied the three elements of standing\u2014injury, cau-\nsation, and redressability\u2014as of the time they filed \nsuit.  Murthy v. Missouri, 603 U.S. 43, 57-58 (2024).  \nThe only question here is how to apply those long-set-\ntled requirements to the peculiar circumstances of this \ncase, involving a waiver of preemption under Section \n209(b) of the Clean Air Act. \nAs petitioners describe things, that question is \n\u201cstraightforward\u201d because standing is automatic here.  \nPet. Br. 35.  Petitioners profit from sales of fuel.  They \nnote that the waiver allowed California to impose \nstate standards limiting greenhouse-gas emissions \nacross automakers\u2019 fleets and requiring automakers to \nsell a certain percentage of zero-emission vehicles.  Pe-\ntitioners assert that \u201c[t]hey promptly challenged \nEPA\u2019s waiver,\u201d id. at 20; that the waiver injures peti-\ntioners and their members by \u201creduc[ing] the use of \nliquid fuel,\u201d id.; and that \u201c[s]etting aside EPA\u2019s waiver \nwould . . . end[] the artificial depression of demand for \npetitioners\u2019 products,\u201d id. at 20-21.  Standing was so \n\u201cobvious,\u201d in their view, that they did not \u201cneed to sup-\nply additional record evidence\u201d to establish redressa-\nbility.  Id. at 17, 18. \nBut \u201capplying the law of standing\u201d frequently de-\nmands a \u201cheavily fact-dependent\u201d inquiry, FDA v. All. \nfor Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 384 (2024), and pe-\ntitioners elide the most salient facts in this case.  EPA \ngranted the relevant waiver in 2013.  Petitioners did \nnot challenge that waiver and neither did anyone else.  \nIt remained in effect for more than six years before \n\n \n2 \n \nEPA withdrew it in 2019.  During those six years, in \nresponse to the state standards and wider national \nand global trends, automakers invested heavily in \nchanging their fleets and building consumer demand \nfor electric vehicles.  Consumer preferences and the \nautomobile market evolved.  Even when EPA with-\ndrew the waiver, automakers accelerated their transi-\ntion to electric vehicles and consumer demand \ncontinued to grow. \nIn 2021, when EPA invited comment on whether to \nreinstate the waiver, the state respondents supported \nreinstatement.  As their comment explained, the with-\ndrawal had exceeded EPA\u2019s authority and it deprived \nCalifornia\u2019s regulations of legal effect.  But by the time \nEPA reinstated the waiver and petitioners challenged \nthat decision in 2022, \u201c\u2018both internal sustainability \ngoals and external market forces\u2019\u201d were pushing \n\u201cmanufacturers to transition toward electric vehicles, \nirrespective of California\u2019s regulations.\u201d  Pet. App. 24a \nn.8.  Indeed, publicly available evidence submitted by \nthe state respondents showed that zero-emission vehi-\ncles sold in California in 2022 already exceeded what \nthe relevant standards required.  Consumers were \nwilling to pay substantial price premiums for those ve-\nhicles.  And automakers had strong incentives to keep \nselling them. \nWhen the court of appeals confronted petitioners\u2019 \nchallenge to the reinstatement, it had to assure itself \nof jurisdiction by evaluating whether vacatur of that \nreinstatement would likely lead automakers to make \nchoices that would redress petitioners\u2019 asserted injury.  \nGiven the circumstances when petitioners filed suit in \nMay 2022, would automakers change their fleets or \nprices in a way that would increase demand for peti-\ntioners\u2019 liquid-fuel products?  Or would automakers \n\n \n3 \n \nexceed the requirements of California\u2019s standards for \ntheir own economic and strategic reasons, even with-\nout a legal requirement to do so?  Petitioners submit-\nted no evidence addressing that critical issue.  And \ngiven that absence of proof, the court of appeals \nproperly held that petitioners failed to meet their bur-\nden of demonstrating redressability. \nPetitioners ask this Court to excuse that failure.  \nThey first urge the Court to adopt a new \u201ccategorical \nrule.\u201d  Pet. Br. 4.  Under that rule, redressability \nwould be established automatically whenever peti-\ntioners challenge a regulation that implicates the use \nof their products\u2014even if the regulation applies only \nto third parties, and even where petitioners introduce \nno evidence indicating that those third parties would \nhave acted differently in the regulation\u2019s absence.  Id.  \nIn the alternative, petitioners ask the Court to credit \ntheir unsubstantiated predictions about how au-\ntomakers might respond to a vacatur.  Id. at 30-35.  \nThose arguments find no support in this Court\u2019s prec-\nedent.  Adopting them would effectively eliminate the \nplaintiff\u2019s \u201cburden of showing that third parties will \nlikely react\u201d to a favorable judgment in a way that pro-\nvides redress.  Dep\u2019t of Com. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, \n768 (2019).  And they would allow a court to assume \nredressability even if all the evidence before it indi-\ncates that a favorable judgment would not, in fact, re-\ndress the plaintiffs\u2019 injury.  This Court should reject \npetitioners\u2019 novel standing theories and affirm the \njudgment below. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal and Regulatory Background \n1.  The Clean Air Act directs EPA to prescribe fed-\neral standards governing emissions of air pollutants \n\n \n4 \n \nfrom new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle en-\ngines.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7521.  Section 209(a) of the Act gen-\nerally preempts States and their political subdivisions \nfrom \u201cadopt[ing] or attempt[ing] to enforce any stand-\nard relating to the control of emissions from new mo-\ntor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines.\u201d  Id. \n\u00a7 7543(a).  But Section 209(b) instructs EPA to \u201cwaive \napplication of [Section 209] to any State which ha[d] \nadopted\u201d qualifying emission standards \u201cprior to \nMarch 30, 1966, if the State determines that the State \nstandards will be, in the aggregate, at least as protec-\ntive of public health and welfare as applicable Federal \nstandards.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7543(b)(1).  If a State makes that de-\ntermination, EPA must waive preemption unless it \nmakes one of three enumerated findings.  See id. \n\u00a7 7543(b)(1)(A)-(C). \nCalifornia is the only State eligible for a waiver un-\nder Section 209(b) because it was the only State that \nhad developed qualifying motor vehicle emissions \nstandards before March 30, 1966.  Pet. App. 7a.  \u201cCon-\ngress recognized that California was already the \n\u2018lead[er] in the establishment of standards for regula-\ntion of automative pollutant emissions\u2019 at a time when \nthe federal government had yet to promulgate any reg-\nulations of its own.\u201d  Engine Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 88 \nF.3d 1075, 1079 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  Congress designed \nSection 209 to allow California to continue to serve as \na \u201c\u2018laboratory for innovation,\u2019\u201d id. at 1080, while also \n\u201cavoid[ing] the economic disruption\u201d that would come \nfrom manufacturers \u201chaving to meet fifty-one separate \nsets of emission control requirements,\u201d Motor & \nEquip. Mfrs. Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. EPA, 627 F.2d 1095, 1109 \n(D.C. Cir. 1979); see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7507 (1977 \namendment allowing other States to adopt standards \n\u201cidentical to the California standards for which a \nwaiver has been granted for such model year\u201d); Pet. \n\n \n5 \n \nApp. 9a n.3 (noting that \u201cseventeen states have chosen \nto adopt some portion of the California regulations\u201d). \nCalifornia received its first waiver in 1968 and has \nreceived additional waivers in every subsequent dec-\nade.1  For instance, EPA granted a waiver in 1993 for \nCalifornia\u2019s first Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) regula-\ntion, which required a specific percentage of light-duty \nvehicles to be zero-emission vehicles with no exhaust \nor evaporative emissions.  58 Fed. Reg. 4166 (Jan. 13, \n1993).2  EPA granted another waiver, in 2009, for Cal-\nifornia\u2019s first set of regulations to control greenhouse-\ngas emissions from motor vehicles.  74 Fed. Reg. \n32,744 (July 8, 2009). \n2.  This litigation concerns a set of emissions \nstandards that California adopted in 2012 as part of \nits Advanced Clean Cars I program.  78 Fed. Reg. 2112 \n(Jan. 9, 2013).  As relevant here, those standards in-\ncluded a requirement that automakers reduce the av-\nerage greenhouse-gas emissions across the fleets of \nvehicles they sell in California.  See id. at 2114.  They \nalso included new ZEV standards, requiring manufac-\nturers to meet specified \u201cZEV credit percentage\u201d re-\nquirements.  Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(b) \n(2012).   \nA manufacturer can satisfy the \u201cZEV credit per-\ncentage\u201d in several ways:  by generating credits from \nsales of qualifying vehicles, purchasing credits from \nother manufacturers, using excess credits banked in \nprior years, or applying credits obtained by overcom-\n \n1 See EPA, Vehicle Emissions California Waivers and Authoriza-\ntions, https://tinyurl.com/3rxscztw (last visited Mar. 6, 2025). \n2  See Cal. Air Res. Bd., Low-Emission Vehicle Program,  \nhttps://tinyurl.com/49m28yze (last visited Mar. 6, 2025). \n\n \n6 \n \nplying with the greenhouse-gas emission require-\nments.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(d)(5); 78 \nFed. Reg. at 2119-2120, 2135.  The number of ZEV \ncredits generated by a vehicle sale depends on the ve-\nhicle\u2019s range when operating on electric power.  See \nCal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(d)(5).  For example, a \nplug-in hybrid vehicle with a \u201c50 mile\u201d electric range \nearns one credit, while a fully battery-electric vehicle \nwith a \u201c350 mile\u201d range earns four credits.3  As a re-\nsult, a fleet may satisfy the standards even though \nZEV sales as a percentage of light-duty vehicles sold \nis well below the applicable ZEV credit percentage re-\nquirement.  \nThe Advanced Clean Cars I standards affected \nmodel years beginning in 2017 (for greenhouse-gas \nemissions) and 2018 (for ZEV requirements).  Both \nsets of standards were originally structured to in-\ncrease in stringency through model year 2025 and re-\nmain in effect at 2025 levels for subsequent model \nyears.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1961.3(a)(1)(A) \n(2012); id. \u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2012); J.A. 50.  In 2022, \nhowever, California amended the ZEV standards (but \nnot the greenhouse-gas standards) to expire after \nmodel year 2025.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \n\u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2022).4 \n \n3 78 Fed. Reg. at 2114-2115; see Cal. Air Res. Bd., ACC II ZEV \nTechnology Assessment, at 11-12 tbl. 2 (Apr. 12, 2022) (showing \nelectric ranges of model year 2021 battery and plug-in hybrid ve-\nhicles), https://tinyurl.com/2d2db9vc (last visited Mar. 11, 2025).  \n4  California adopted that amendment because its Advanced \nClean Cars II standards included a new set of ZEV requirements \napplicable to model years 2026 and beyond.  See Cal. Code Regs. \ntit. 13, \u00a7 1962.4(a) (2022).  EPA granted a waiver for the Ad-\nvanced Clean Cars II standards on December 17, 2024.  90 Fed. \n(continued\u2026) \n\n \n7 \n \nCalifornia requested a waiver for the Advanced \nClean Cars I program in 2012.  That request described \nhow the new standards would increase production of \nzero-emission vehicles, thus decreasing emissions of \ncriteria pollutants and greenhouse gases.  J.A. 34-35, \n40-44.  EPA granted the waiver in early 2013.  78 Fed. \nReg. at 2145.  As the Federal Register notice of that \naction observed, petitions for judicial review were due \nby March 11, 2013.  Id.; see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1).  No-\nbody challenged EPA\u2019s decision to grant the waiver. \nMore than six years later, EPA withdrew the parts \nof the waiver at issue in this case.  84 Fed. Reg. 51,310 \n(Sept. 27, 2019).  By that time, automakers had made \n\u201cinvestments to meet\u201d the greenhouse-gas and ZEV \nstandards and \u201chad adjusted their fleets to comply \nwith\u201d them.  Pet. App. 12a; see id. at 124a.  Consumers \nhad grown increasingly familiar with zero-emission \nvehicles.  Even after the waiver was withdrawn, con-\nsumer demand for those vehicles continued to grow \nand automakers continued to announce plans to sell \nthem in greater numbers.  J.A. 191-192, 201-203.  By \n2020, for example, zero-emission vehicles were around \n8% of the new light-duty vehicles registered in Califor-\nnia; that figure jumped to over 12% the following \nyear.5 \nIn 2021, EPA solicited comment on whether it \nshould reinstate the waiver.  The state respondents \nsubmitted a comment in July 2021, explaining that \n \nReg. 642 (2025).  Several challenges to that waiver are now pend-\ning, including one that two of the petitioners here filed on Febru-\nary 28, 2025.  Pet. for Rev., Valero Renewable Fuels Co., LLC v. \nEPA, No. 25-1078 (D.C. Cir.).   \n5 Cal. Energy Comm\u2019n, New ZEV Sales in California, https://ti-\nnyurl.com/pt526fp5 (displaying \u201cZEV Sales Share\u201d in top-right \ncorner when 2020 and 2021 filters are selected). \n\n \n8 \n \nthe withdrawal was unlawful and poorly reasoned.  \nC.A. J.A. 188-215; see J.A. 51-68.  Auto-industry com-\nmenters emphasized the \u201cbillions of dollars of invest-\nment \nin \nelectric \nvehicle \nmanufacturing \nand \ninfrastructure\u201d that automakers had already made as \na result of the 2013 decision to grant the waiver.  J.A. \n103 (National Coalition for Advanced Transportation \ncomment); cf. J.A. 63 (California comment observing \nthat \u201cautomakers have complied with, and often over-\ncomplied with, model years 2017-2020 already\u201d).  EPA \nreinstated the waiver in March 2022.  87 Fed. Reg. \n14,332 (Mar. 14, 2022). \nB. Procedural Background \n1.  The petitioners here are various companies that \nproduce or sell liquid fuels, as well as related trade as-\nsociations.  Pet. App. 2a.  They filed petitions for re-\nview of EPA\u2019s reinstatement decision in the D.C. \nCircuit on May 12, 2022.  Id. at 15a.  The court of ap-\npeals consolidated those cases, along with another \ncase initiated by a group of States led by Ohio.  Id.  \nShortly thereafter, the state respondents here filed an \nunopposed motion for leave to intervene in support of \nEPA, as did various automakers and public-interest \norganizations.  Id. at 15a & nn.4-6; see J.A. 107.  Those \nmotions were granted.  See Pet. App. 15a. \nPetitioners principally argued that EPA\u2019s rein-\nstatement of the waiver contravened the Clean Air \nAct.  Pet. App. 16a.  Before the court of appeals could \nreach the merits of that claim, however, it had to as-\nsure itself of jurisdiction.  Under longstanding circuit \nrules, the opening brief for a petitioner seeking review \nof agency action \u201cmust set forth the basis for the claim \nof standing.\u201d  D.C. Cir. R. 28(a)(7).  And if \u201cstanding is \nnot apparent from the administrative record, the brief \nmust include arguments and evidence establishing the \n\n \n9 \n \nclaim of standing.\u201d  Id.; see also Sierra Club v. EPA, \n292 F.3d 895, 901 (D.C. Cir. 2002). \nPetitioners\u2019 opening brief below devoted just two \nparagraphs to standing.  J.A. 118-119.  Petitioners ex-\nplained that \u201cdepressing the demand\u201d for liquid fuels \n\u201cinjures petitioners and petitioners\u2019 members finan-\ncially.\u201d  Id. at 118.  They cited documents from Cali-\nfornia\u2019s 2011 rulemaking in which a California agency \nhad forecast the prospect of financial injury to oil and \ngas industry participants.  Id. (citing C.A. J.A. 799, \n801, 830, 832).  Petitioners asserted that \u201c[t]his eco-\nnomic injury . . . is caused by the challenged regula-\ntory action, and this Court can redress that injury by \nsetting aside the action.\u201d  J.A. 118.  They attached 14 \ndeclarations, but the only discussion of redressability \nin those declarations consisted of unsupported asser-\ntions that vacatur would remedy petitioners\u2019 injury.  \nId. at 130, 137, 150, 154, 158, 167. \nIn response, the state respondents argued that pe-\ntitioners had failed to establish standing, emphasizing \nthat petitioners provided no evidence that vacatur of \nthe reinstatement decision in May 2022 would change \nautomakers\u2019 behavior in a way that would increase \nfuel sales.  J.A. 185-187.  The state respondents also \nsubmitted evidence undermining the likelihood of any \nsuch change:  by 2022, sales of zero-emission vehicles \nin California exceeded what was required by the rele-\nvant standards; consumer demand for those vehicles \nwas growing, as was consumer willingness to pay price \npremiums; and many manufacturers had announced \nplans for even greater zero-emission vehicle sales in \nthe future.  Id. at 191-195, 201-203.  On reply, peti-\ntioners did not submit record evidence countering the \nstate respondents\u2019 evidence about the circumstances \nin 2022.  See id. at 209-211. \n\n \n10 \n \nAt oral argument, the panel questioned petitioners \nabout jurisdiction, with a particular focus on the \u201car-\ngument that you haven\u2019t demonstrated redressabil-\nity.\u201d  C.A. Oral Arg. 25:50-26:12.  Two weeks later, \npetitioners sought leave to file a supplemental brief \nand to supplement the record with two new declara-\ntions.  Pet. App. 30a.  The proposed brief and declara-\ntions mostly addressed the separate issue of mootness.  \nSee C.A. Private Pet. Proposed Supp. Br. 1-3, 4-13.  In \na short section on standing, petitioners characterized \nthe arguments against redressability as \u201cimplausible\u201d \nand \u201cincredible,\u201d id. at 3, 4\u2014but again cited no evi-\ndence establishing how judicial relief in May 2022 \nwould have redressed their asserted injuries, and did \nnot attempt to counter the state respondents\u2019 evidence \non that point.   \n2.  The court of appeals concluded that it lacked ju-\nrisdiction to decide petitioners\u2019 challenge because pe-\ntitioners had failed to establish Article III standing.  \nPet. App. 16a-19a.  Without deciding whether petition-\ners had established injury or causation, the court ex-\nplained that petitioners fell \u201cfar short of meeting their \nburden\u201d to establish a likelihood \u201cthat their alleged \ninjuries would be redressed\u201d if the court agreed with \npetitioners\u2019 merits theory and vacated EPA\u2019s rein-\nstatement decision.  Id. at 21a. \nAs the court explained, redressability for petition-\ners \u201c\u2018hinge[d] on\u2019 the actions of third parties\u2014the au-\ntomobile manufacturers who are subject to the \nwaiver.\u201d  Pet. App. 22a.  Petitioners needed to show \nthat automakers would respond to vacatur of the rein-\nstatement \u201cby producing and selling fewer non-con-\nventional vehicles or by altering the prices of their \nvehicles such that fewer non-conventional vehicles\u2014\nand more conventional vehicles\u2014were sold.\u201d  Id.  But \n\n \n11 \n \nthe record indicated \u201cthat \u2018manufacturers are already \nselling more qualifying vehicles in California than the \nState\u2019s standards require,\u2019\u201d id. at 28a, and \u201cthat \u2018both \ninternal sustainability goals and external market \nforces\u2019 are prompting manufacturers to transition to-\nward electric vehicles, irrespective of California\u2019s reg-\nulations,\u201d id. at 24a n.8; see also id. at 28a. \nNevertheless, the court of appeals observed, peti-\ntioners \u201ctreated redressability as a foregone conclu-\nsion\u201d instead of making a factual showing.  Pet. App. \n25a.  They did not \u201cattempt[] to explain in any detail \nhow their injuries are redressable, let alone to \u2018cit[e] \nany record evidence\u2019 or to file \u2018additional affidavits or \nother evidence sufficient to support\u2019 redressability.\u201d  \nId. at 24a-25a.  Nor did petitioners \u201cmeaningfully ad-\ndress[]\u201d redressability on reply, after the state re-\nspondents \nintroduced \narguments \nand \nevidence \ncontesting redressability.  Id. at 28a.  \u201cUltimately, the \nrecord evidence, coupled with the filings of the EPA \nand intervenors, provide[d] th[e] Court with no basis \nto conclude that Petitioners\u2019 claims are redressable\u2014\na necessary element of standing that Petitioners bear \nthe burden of establishing.\u201d  Id. at 29a. \nThe court of appeals also described its understand-\ning that the challenge before it \u201cconcern[ed] only\u201d the \nreinstatement of the waiver \u201cas to Model Years 2017 \nthrough 2025.\u201d  Pet. App. 22a.  But see supra p. 6; infra \np. 44.  On that understanding, the court explained, pe-\ntitioners had to show \u201cnot only that automobile man-\nufacturers are likely to respond to a decision by this \nCourt by changing their fleets in a way that alleviates \n[petitioners\u2019] injuries in some way, but also that auto-\nmobile manufacturers would do so relatively quickly\u2014\nby Model Year 2025.\u201d  Pet. App. 23a.  That timing ele-\n\n \n12 \n \nment \u201cfurther complicated\u201d the redressability analy-\nsis,\u201d in the court\u2019s view.  Id. at 22a.  \u201c[E]ven if\u201d peti-\ntioners \nhad \nestablished \nthat \n\u201cautomobile \nmanufacturers were inclined to change course\u201d in re-\nsponse to a vacatur in a way that would increase fuel \nsales, it was \u201cfar from clear that they could do so\u201d by \nmodel year 2025.  Id. at 24a; see id. at 23a. \nFinally, the court of appeals denied petitioners\u2019 \npost-argument motion for leave to file a supplemental \nbrief and declarations.  Pet. App. 30a-32a.  The court \nexplained that, under the circumstances, petitioners \nshould have understood their obligation to address re-\ndressability in their opening brief.  Id. at 31a.  Moreo-\nver, \u201c[p]etitioners offer[ed] no explanation for having \nfailed to address redressability in their reply brief af-\nter California raised the issue in its opposition brief.\u201d  \nId. at 32a. \nPetitioners did not seek panel rehearing or rehear-\ning en banc.  They instead filed a petition for a writ of \ncertiorari respecting both the redressability question \nand the merits of their statutory claim (which the \ncourt of appeals had not reached).  This Court granted \ncertiorari on the redressability question only.6 \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nPetitioners sought a judgment vacating EPA\u2019s re-\ninstatement of a nearly decade-old waiver.  Under set-\ntled precedent, petitioners had the burden of \nestablishing that automakers would likely respond to \n \n6 This Court also denied a petition for certiorari filed by Ohio and \nother petitioners, which advanced a separate constitutional \nclaim.  See Ohio v. EPA, No. 24-13 (Dec. 16, 2024).  The court of \nappeals had held that the Ohio petitioners established standing \nto bring that claim, but it rejected the claim on the merits.  See \nPet. App. 32a-49a. \n\n \n13 \n \nthat vacatur in ways that would increase demand for \npetitioners\u2019 liquid-fuel products.  By the time they \nfiled suit in May 2022, however, the likely effect of a \nvacatur was not self-evident:  in the nine years since \nEPA first granted the waiver, automakers had made \nenormous investments in producing and marketing \nzero-emission vehicles; consumer demand for those ve-\nhicles had recently surged; and evidence before the \nCourt indicated that automakers would continue to \nsell those vehicles in large numbers regardless of the \nreinstatement or its potential vacatur.  Article III re-\nquired petitioners to introduce current evidence but-\ntressing their assertion that a vacatur in 2022 would \nlead automakers to change their fleets or prices in \nways that would increase liquid-fuel sales.  Because \npetitioners did not even attempt to do so, the court of \nappeals properly held that they failed to establish \nstanding. \nIn this Court, petitioners advance several novel \ntheories for why they had no obligation to introduce \nany evidence of redressability.  None of those theories \nis persuasive.  They first propose a categorical rule \nthat redressability is automatically established when-\never a challenged government action implicates the \nuse of the challenger\u2019s products.  Pet. Br. 17-18.  Prec-\nedent forecloses that proposal:  this Court has consist-\nently focused on the particular facts of a case\u2014and \nrequired challengers to submit specific evidence sup-\nporting redressability before obtaining a final judg-\nment.  For similar reasons, plaintiffs may not rely on \nunsupported predictions about the effects of a judg-\nment on a third party\u2019s choices.  See id. at 18.  They \nmust instead meet \u201ctheir burden of showing that third \nparties will likely react in predictable ways\u201d by intro-\nducing actual evidence.  Dep\u2019t of Com. v. New York, \n588 U.S. 752, 768 (2019).  And the fact that a statute \n\n \n14 \n \nor regulation \u201cdoes not sunset\u201d (Pet. Br. 19) does not, \nby itself, establish standing to challenge it. \nFinally, petitioners\u2019 belated attempts to identify \nrecord evidence supporting redressability cannot \nchange the outcome here.  Their briefs and declara-\ntions below were conclusory on the subject of redress-\nability.  The additional evidence they describe in this \nCourt not only comes too late, it would have been in-\nsufficient even if they had presented it below:  it con-\nsists of outdated projections that cannot substitute for \nevidence about the market as it existed when petition-\ners filed this challenge in May 2022. \nARGUMENT \nI. PETITIONERS FAILED TO ESTABLISH REDRESSA-\nBILITY \nPetitioners had the burden to establish standing.  \nAs to redressability, they had to show that judicial va-\ncatur of the reinstatement decision at the time they \nfiled suit in May 2022 would likely lead to increased \nfuel sales.  They failed to carry that burden.   \nA. It Was Petitioners\u2019 Burden to Introduce \nEvidence Establishing Each Element of \nArticle III Standing \nBefore turning to the merits of a suit, a court must \nassure itself of jurisdiction.  Summers v. Earth Island \nInst., 555 U.S. 488, 499 (2009).  The \u201cburden of estab-\nlishing\u201d jurisdiction lies with \u201cthe party asserting ju-\nrisdiction.\u201d  Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., \n511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994) (citing McNutt v. Gen. Motors \nAcceptance Corp. of Ind., 298 U.S. 178, 182-183 \n(1936)). \nStanding is \u201can essential and unchanging part\u201d of \nArticle III jurisdiction.  Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 \n\n \n15 \n \nU.S. 555, 560 (1992).  The doctrine of standing is built \non \u201cthe idea of separation of powers.\u201d  United States v. \nTexas, 599 U.S. 670, 675 (2023).  It \u201cimplements \u2018the \nFramers\u2019 concept of the proper\u2014and properly lim-\nited\u2014role of the courts in a democratic society.\u2019\u201d  FDA \nv. All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 380 (2024) \n(quoting Roberts, Article III Limits on Statutory \nStanding, 42 Duke L.J. 1219, 1220 (1993)). \nThe \u201cirreducible constitutional minimum of stand-\ning contains three elements.\u201d  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560.  \nFirst, the party bringing suit \u201cmust have suffered an \n\u2018injury in fact.\u2019\u201d  Id.  Second, that injury must \u201cbe \n\u2018fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defend-\nant, and not the result of the independent action of \nsome third party not before the court.\u2019\u201d  Id. (altera-\ntions omitted).  And third, \u201cit must be \u2018likely,\u2019 as op-\nposed to merely \u2018speculative,\u2019 that the injury will be \n\u2018redressed by a favorable decision.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 561.  Each \nelement is assessed as of the time the suit commenced.  \nMurthy v. Missouri, 603 U.S. 43, 58 (2024). \nA party seeking to invoke the jurisdiction of a fed-\neral court \u201cmust support each element of standing \n\u2018with the manner and degree of evidence required at \nthe successive stages of the litigation.\u2019\u201d  Murthy, 603 \nU.S. at 58.  At the outset of litigation, \u201c\u2018mere allega-\ntions\u2019\u201d may suffice; as the case progresses, a party \n\u201cmust . . . point to factual evidence.\u201d  Id.  A petitioner \nwho challenges agency action may be able to carry its \nburden by identifying evidence in the administrative \nrecord that establishes its standing.  See, e.g., Sierra \nClub v. EPA, 292 F.3d 895, 899-900 (D.C. Cir. 2002).  \nBut if \u201cstanding is not apparent from the administra-\ntive record,\u201d a petitioner\u2019s \u201cbrief must include argu-\nments and evidence establishing the claim of \nstanding.\u201d  D.C. Cir. R. 28(a)(7); see Sierra Club, 292 \n\n \n16 \n \nF.3d at 900; see generally 15 Redish, Moore\u2019s Federal \nPractice \u00a7\u00a7 101.31, 101.61[10] (3d ed. & Supp. 2025). \nSometimes standing analysis is straightforward.  \nFor instance, in some cases the party invoking the \ncourt\u2019s jurisdiction is itself \u201can object of\u201d the chal-\nlenged government action.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.  \nThe government might, for example, proscribe speech \nthat the plaintiff engages in.  See, e.g., Susan B. An-\nthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 161-167 (2014).  \nOr it might require a state plaintiff to engage in par-\nticular regulation.  See, e.g., West Virginia v. EPA, 597 \nU.S. 697, 718-719 (2022).  In those scenarios, \u201cthere is \nordinarily little question that the action . . . has \ncaused [the plaintiff] injury, and that a judgment pre-\nventing . . . the action will redress\u201d that injury.  Lujan, \n504 U.S. at 561-562; see All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 \nU.S. at 382. \nIn other scenarios, \u201cmuch more is needed.\u201d  Lujan, \n504 U.S. at 562.  When a party\u2019s \u201casserted injury \narises from the government\u2019s allegedly unlawful regu-\nlation . . . of someone else,\u201d for example, standing can \nbe \u201c\u2018substantially more difficult\u2019 to establish.\u201d  Id.  In \nthose cases, \u201ccausation and redressability ordinarily \nhinge on the response of\u201d that third party\u2014\u201cand per-\nhaps on the response of others as well.\u201d  Id.  Because \nthe inquiry turns on \u201cchoices made by independent ac-\ntors not before the courts,\u201d the plaintiff must \u201cadduce \nfacts showing that those choices have been or will be \nmade in such manner as to produce causation and per-\nmit redressability of injury.\u201d  Id.  For instance, if plain-\ntiffs are injured by the lack of affordable private \nhousing, they must show \u201can actionable causal rela-\ntionship\u201d between the challenged zoning ordinance \nand the choices of private third parties who build and \nsell housing.  Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 507 \n\n \n17 \n \n(1975).  Their claim may not proceed if the asserted \ninjury instead results from \u201cthe economics of the area \nhousing market.\u201d  Id. at 506; see generally id. at 508 \n(requiring the party \u201cwho seeks to challenge\u201d a gov-\nernment action to introduce \u201cspecific, concrete facts \ndemonstrating . . . that he personally would benefit in \na tangible way from the court\u2019s intervention\u201d). \nConcrete evidence from the plaintiff is especially \ncritical if another party has introduced evidence un-\ndermining the asserted theory of standing.  \u201cWhen \nchallenged by . . . an opposing party,\u201d for example, a \nplaintiff \u201cinvoking the court\u2019s jurisdiction cannot \nsimply allege a nonobvious harm, without more.\u201d  \nWittman v. Personhuballah, 578 U.S. 539, 545 (2016).  \nAnd if \u201cthere is no \u2018more,\u2019\u201d then there is no jurisdic-\ntion.  Id.; see generally Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U.S. \n77, 96-97 (2010) (when defendants raise facts calling \njurisdiction into doubt, plaintiffs \u201cmust support their \nallegations by competent proof\u201d). \nB. The Circumstances of This Case Raised a \nSerious Question as to Whether Petition-\ners\u2019 Claim Was Redressable \nAs the court of appeals recognized, this is not a case \nwhere standing is self-evident.  Petitioners comprise \ncompanies that produce or refine fuel, companies that \ndevelop biorefining technology, and various trade as-\nsociations (for energy companies, farmers, and con-\nvenience store owners).  Pet. Br. II-V, 20.  They claim \nan injury of financial harm from reduced fuel sales.  \nId. at 21-22.  But the standards at issue here do not \nregulate fuel production or sales.  Instead, the stand-\nards regulate an activity in which petitioners do not \nparticipate:  automobile sales.  Because petitioners are \nnot directly regulated by the challenged agency action, \n\n \n18 \n \nthey needed to identify evidence showing that au-\ntomakers who are subject to those standards would \nmake choices that would \u201cproduce causation and per-\nmit redressability of injury.\u201d  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 562. \nPetitioners\u2019 theory is that the state emissions \nstandards injure them by effectively requiring au-\ntomakers to sell more \u201cvehicles that use less or no liq-\nuid fuel,\u201d which reduces demand for petitioners\u2019 \nproducts.  Pet. Br. 17.  They posit that their revenues \nwould increase if the standards no longer had legal ef-\nfect, because automakers would then make and sell \nmore cars that run on liquid fuel.  Id. at 24.  That the-\nory would indeed have been \u201cstraightforward\u201d (id. at \n35) if petitioners had promptly sought review follow-\ning EPA\u2019s original approval of the waiver in 2013\u2014as \nthey recently did in challenging the Advanced Clean \nCars II waiver, see supra p. 6 n.4.7 \nIn calendar year 2013, zero-emission vehicles made \nup about 2% of light-duty vehicle sales in California.8  \nTo meet the \u201cminimum ZEV credit percentage\u201d re-\nquirements of the Advanced Clean Cars I standards, \n \n7 Petitioners have suggested that D.C. Circuit precedent prohib-\nited them from challenging the 2013 action because California \ndeemed compliance with federal standards to satisfy the state \nstandards.  See Pet. 8 (citing Chamber of Com. of U.S. v. EPA, \n642 F.3d 192, 206 (D.C. Cir. 2011)); Pet. Br. 8-9.  But California\u2019s \nZEV standards\u2014the main focus of petitioners\u2019 present chal-\nlenge\u2014never contained a \u201cdeemed-to-comply\u201d provision, and \nthus could have been challenged in 2013.  J.A. 59-60 n.14 \n(deemed-to-comply provision \u201conly applies to the [greenhouse-\ngas] standard\u201d). \n8 See Cal. Air Res. Bd., California\u2019s Advanced Clean Cars Mid-\nterm Review, App. B, at B15 fig. 9 (Jan. 18, 2017), https://ti-\nnyurl.com/yrzdx3t4. \n\n \n19 \n \nautomakers needed to grow their zero-emission vehi-\ncle sales many times over:  they would have to meet a \nminimum credit percentage of 4.5% by model year \n2018, rising to 22% by model year 2025.  Cal. Code \nRegs. tit. 13, \u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2012).  Regulators es-\ntimated that meeting that 22% credit requirement \nwould require zero-emission vehicles to comprise \nabout 15% of light-duty new-vehicle sales by 2025.  See \nJ.A. 16, 32; 78 Fed. Reg. 2112, 2119 (Jan. 9, 2013).  Ab-\nsent the new regulatory requirement, there was no \nreason to think automakers would make that shift for \ntheir own independent reasons.  Consumers in 2013 \nwere largely unfamiliar with zero-emission vehicles or \nhad a negative impression of them.9  And automakers \nwarned that \u201cconsumer demand for ZEVs\u201d was so ane-\nmic that they might not even be able to meet the re-\nquirements for model year 2018.  78 Fed. Reg. at 2140.   \nBut petitioner challenged EPA\u2019s reinstatement of \nthe waiver nearly a decade later.  By then, companies \nhad been \u201cmaking investments\u201d for years \u201cin updating \ntheir fleets and growing consumer demand for electric \nvehicles.\u201d  Pet. App. 12a, 14a.

And they had in-\nvested in \u201cconsumer outreach\u201d and \u201ceducation\u201d to \nboost demand.11 \nSome of those investments might have been in re-\nsponse to the California standards\u2014but not all.  \nGlobal demand and industry trends also spurred au-\ntomakers to invest in developing and marketing zero-\nemission vehicles.12  And even during the multi-year \nperiod when California\u2019s waiver was withdrawn, au-\ntomakers had \u201caccelerat[ed their] transition to electri-\nfied vehicles across a wide range of vehicle segments.\u201d  \n86 Fed.

App. 13a-14a.   \nWhatever their cause, automakers\u2019 enormous in-\nvestments in electric vehicles since 2013 resulted in a \ndramatic increase in demand for zero-emission vehi-\ncles between 2020 and 2022.  See J.A. 191 (national \nmarket share of qualifying vehicles \u201calmost tripled\u201d \nacross that two-year period).

Br. 18, 34, 35) in \nMay 2022 that reduced sales of petitioners\u2019 fuel prod-\nucts were caused by the reinstatement of the waiver\u2014\ninstead of market forces and automakers\u2019 prior invest-\nments and plans.  Nor was it obvious that vacatur of \nthe reinstatement would likely affect automakers\u2019 fu-\nture behavior in a way that would redress the asserted \ninjury. \nIndeed, evidence submitted by the state respond-\nents indicated the opposite.  Publicly accessible sales \ndata showed that \u201czero-emission vehicles sold in cal-\nendar year 2022\u201d in California \u201cexceed what [the] \nstandards require.\u201d  J.A. 192.  For that calendar year, \nabout 19% of light-duty vehicles sold in the State qual-\nified as zero-emission vehicles under California\u2019s \nstandards\u2014exceeding the 15% that regulators had \nforecast would be needed for compliance.  Id. at 191-\n192; see supra p. 19.  The lion\u2019s share of those sales \n(16% of total light-duty sales) were battery-electric ve-\nhicles.13   \nThat represented a surge in sales of battery-elec-\ntric vehicles that far outpaced early forecasts.  The \nforecasts had projected that automakers would need \nbattery-electric vehicles to be just 3.7% of total light-\nduty sales by model year 2025 to meet the credit re-\nquirements of the ZEV standards.  J.A. 9.  The unex-\npected consumer shift to battery-electric vehicles \n(rather than plug-in hybrids, as forecasters originally \n \n13\n New \nZEV \nSales \nin \nCalifornia, \nsupra, \nhttps://ti-\nnyurl.com/pt526fp5 (displaying 262,076 \u201cBEV\u201d out of 1,581,844 \nannual light-duty sales when 2022 filter is selected). \n\n \n22 \n \nanticipated) had profound consequences for automak-\ners\u2019 compliance with the Advanced Clean Cars I stand-\nards.  Because battery-electric vehicles can travel \nlonger distances without emitting tailpipe pollutants, \nthey yield the most \u201cZEV credits\u201d for purposes of the \nstandards.  See supra p. 6.  So the fact that 16% of \nlight-duty sales were battery-electric vehicles in 2022 \nyielded a ZEV credit percentage for that year that was \nfar above the highest requirement that the standards \nwould ever impose.  See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \n\u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2012) (22% ZEV credit requirement \nstarting in model year 2025).  And sales in California \nin 2022 were also exceeding the most stringent re-\nquirements of the fleetwide greenhouse-gas stand-\nards, even for future years, because the battery-\nelectric vehicles also have far lower emissions than \nplug-in hybrids.  See J.A. 7. \nBy May 2022, nine years after EPA first granted a \nwaiver for the Advanced Clean Cars I standards, there \nwas substantial reason to believe that automakers \nwould exceed the standards for their own reasons even \nwithout the reinstatement.  The court of appeals could \nnot \u201cpresume[]\u201d that petitioners\u2019 challenge was re-\ndressable.  Kokkonen, 511 U.S. at 377.  Nor could it \nassume redressability based on petitioners\u2019 \u201cuna-\ndorned speculation.\u201d  Simon v. E. Ky. Welfare Rts. \nOrg., 426 U.S. 26, 44 (1976).  Article III required the \ncourt to ask whether petitioners had \u201cmet their bur-\nden\u201d by introducing evidence demonstrating that au-\ntomakers would \u201clikely react\u201d to a vacatur of the 2022 \nreinstatement in ways that would increase demand for \npetitioners\u2019 products and services.  Dep\u2019t of Com. v. \nNew York, 588 U.S. 752, 768 (2019).   \n\n \n23 \n \nC. Petitioners Did Not Introduce Evidence \nEstablishing Redressability \nPetitioners did not carry their evidentiary burden.  \nIndeed, they submitted virtually no argument or evi-\ndence bearing on the likely effect of a vacatur on the \nmarket as it existed in 2022.   \n1.  Petitioners\u2019 opening brief in the court of appeals \ndevoted one sentence to redressability.  They asserted \nthat their \u201cinjury is caused by the challenged regula-\ntory action, and this Court can redress that injury by \nsetting aside the action.\u201d  J.A. 118.  That single con-\nclusory statement was not supported by any citation \nto evidence in the administrative record or elsewhere.  \nPetitioners attached 14 standing declarations to their \nopening brief.  See J.A. 120-184.  But none of those \ndeclarations was sufficient to carry their burden. \nThe bulk of each declaration described the declar-\nant\u2019s asserted injuries, with details supporting the \n(undisputed) proposition that petitioners and their \nmembers profit from fuel sales.  The declarants had \nalmost nothing to say about the critical question going \nto causation and redressability, which \u201care often \u2018flip \nsides of the same coin.\u2019\u201d  All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 \nU.S. at 380.  That question was whether, in 2022, the \nreinstatement of the waiver or the vacatur of that re-\ninstatement would affect automakers\u2019 choices in a \nmanner leading to changes in fuel sales.   \nOf the declarants who addressed causation, some \nasserted their \u201cunderstand[ing] that California\u2019s \ngreenhouse-gas standards and zero-emission-vehicle \nmandate reduce the demand for fuel in California.\u201d  \nJ.A. 125, 140, 169, 183; see also J.A. 176.  Those asser-\ntions were not accompanied by supporting facts or any \ndiscussion of the circumstances in 2022.  Other declar-\nants invoked statements from California about how \n\n \n24 \n \nthe standards would reduce demand for liquid fuels.  \nId. at 129, 136-137, 148, 153, 157, 166, 173, 180.  Peti-\ntioners now describe those statements as \u201crecent[] \nproject[ions] that the waiver would \u2018reduce emissions \nthrough reductions in fuel production.\u2019\u201d  Pet. Br. 38 \n(citing J.A. 148, 180).  But the projections are not \u201cre-\ncent\u201d at all.  They are from California\u2019s \u201c2012 Waiver \nRequest\u201d\u2014and state rulemaking documents submit-\nted as part of that request\u2014prepared a decade before \nthe challenged reinstatement and petitioners\u2019 suit.  \nJ.A. 148, 180; see also id. at 180 (citing state estimates \nfrom 2011).  Those outdated sources did not establish \nthat any reduced fuel sales in 2022 were caused by the \nwaiver\u2019s reinstatement instead of the dramatic \nchanges in the market and consumer demand that \npredated the reinstatement.14  \nThe declarants who addressed redressability did so \nin a single boilerplate sentence asserting that petition-\ners\u2019 \u201cinjuries would be substantially ameliorated if \nEPA\u2019s decision were set aside.\u201d  J.A. 130, 137, 150, \n154, 158, 167, 181; see Pet. App. 21a-22a.  Again, not \none of the declarants addressed the state of the market \nin 2022, when petitioners filed their suit.  Nor did they \nsay a word about automakers\u2019 behavior at that time, \nor the economic and other considerations that would \nshape automakers\u2019 response to a judicial vacatur.

Laidlaw Env\u2019t \nServs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 201 (2000) (Scalia, J., \ndissenting) (discussing this Court\u2019s \u201crefus[al] to find \n \n14 One declarant also referenced a 2020 report by a Minnesota \nagency.  J.A. 174; see Pet. Br. 38.  But the national market share \nof qualifying vehicles \u201calmost tripled\u201d between 2020 and 2022.  \nJ.A. 191.  In any event, petitioners\u2019 briefs in the court of appeals \nnever mentioned effects on the Minnesota market as a basis for \nstanding. \n\n \n25 \n \nstanding based on the \u2018conclusory allegations of an af-\nfidavit\u2019\u201d); Lujan v. Nat\u2019l Wildlife Fed\u2019n, 497 U.S. 871, \n898-899 (1990) (\u201cagree[ing]\u201d that an affidavit was \u201cin-\nsufficient to establish [the challenger\u2019s] right to seek \njudicial review\u201d where it was \u201c\u2018conclusory and com-\npletely devoid of specific facts\u2019\u201d with respect to the key \nissue). \nEven after the state respondents submitted their \nown evidence addressing those subjects and undercut-\nting petitioners\u2019 theory of redressability, supra p. 9, \npetitioners did not \u201cmeaningfully address[] the re-\ndressability of their economic injuries in their reply \nbrief[].\u201d  Pet. App. 28a-29a.  Their primary contention \non reply was that the States\u2019 argument \u201cdefies com-\nmon sense.\u201d  J.A. 209.  They also quoted statements \nfrom the state respondents\u2019 July 2021 comment in sup-\nport of the reinstatement.  Id. at 210; see Pet. Br. 38 \n(citing J.A. 66).  Those statements explained why \nEPA\u2019s 2019 decision to revoke the waiver was unjusti-\nfied based on the record EPA had before it in that year, \nsee J.A. 66 (citing 84 Fed. Reg. 51,310, 51,337 (Sept. \n27, 2019)), and then described California\u2019s \u201cdemon-\nstration in its 2012 waiver request,\u201d J.A. 66.  Neither \nstatement could have taken account of the market \ndata showing that zero-emission vehicle sales tripled \nbetween 2020 and mid-2022.  See id. at 191. \nAnd petitioners\u2019 reply (J.A. 208-212) did not mean-\ningfully address that more recent data either\u2014or the \nevidence showing that market penetration of zero-\nemission vehicles in California in 2022 far exceeded \nany current or future requirement of the relevant \nstandards.  Nor did petitioners respond to the evidence \nindicating that automakers would \u201cha[ve] a similar in-\ncentive to engage in\u201d the promotion and sale of zero-\n\n \n26 \n \nemission vehicles even if the standards were not in ef-\nfect.  Clapper v. Amnesty Int\u2019l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 417 \n(2013); see Warth, 422 U.S. at 506 (no standing where \nevidence suggested that plaintiffs\u2019 injury was \u201cthe con-\nsequence of the economics of the . . . market\u201d).15 \nIn short, petitioners\u2019 initial submission relied on \nthe \u201cpossibility, unsubstantiated by allegations of fact, \nthat their situation . . . might improve were the court \nto afford relief.\u201d  Warth, 422 U.S. at 507.  And petition-\ners\u2019 submission on reply neglected their duty to \u201csup-\nport their allegations by competent proof,\u201d once \n\u201cchallenged on allegations of jurisdictional facts.\u201d  \nHertz Corp., 559 U.S. at 96-97.   \n2.  Article III demanded more.  This Court has re-\npeatedly rejected theories of redressability that de-\npend on \u201c\u2018guesswork as to how independent \ndecisionmakers will exercise their judgment\u2019\u201d instead \nof concrete evidence submitted by the party seeking to \ninvoke federal jurisdiction.  Murthy, 603 U.S. at 57; \nsee, e.g., id. at 73-74; Haaland v. Brackeen, 599 U.S. \n255, 293-294 (2023); Lujan, 504 U.S. at 568-571 (plu-\nrality opinion); Simon, 426 U.S. at 42-43.  \u201cA federal \ncourt cannot ignore\u201d a party\u2019s failure to establish re-\ndressability \u201cwithout overstepping its assigned role in \nour system of adjudicating only actual cases and con-\ntroversies.\u201d  Simon, 426 U.S. at 39.  Because petition-\ners did not provide the court of appeals with any facts \nshowing a likelihood that vacating EPA\u2019s 2022 rein-\nstatement would redress their asserted injuries, the \ncourt properly held that it lacked jurisdiction to decide \nthe merits.  Pet. App. 30a. \n \n15 See generally Nat\u2019l Council for Adoption v. Blinken, 4 F.4th \n106, 111-112 (D.C. Cir. 2021) (discussing when standing evidence \nmay be introduced on reply).   \n\n \n27 \n \nNo one can doubt petitioners\u2019 desire to obtain an \nimmediate and definitive judicial resolution of their \nmerits theories.  See Pet. 26-27.  But the requirements \nof Article III often \u201cmean[] that the federal courts de-\ncide some contested legal questions later rather than \nsooner.\u201d  All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 380.  \nThe court of appeals properly adhered to those re-\nquirements here, refusing to reach the merits after pe-\ntitioners forewent any genuine effort to introduce facts \nestablishing a likelihood that vacatur of the 2022 re-\ninstatement would increase demand for their prod-\nucts. \nII. PETITIONERS IDENTIFY NO VALID BASIS FOR RE-\nVERSAL \nHaving failed \u201cto \u2018cit[e] any record evidence\u2019 or to \nfile \u2018additional affidavits or other evidence sufficient to \nsupport\u2019 redressability\u201d in the court below, Pet. App. \n24a-25a, petitioners now ask this Court to hold that \nthey did \u201cnot need to supply additional record evi-\ndence,\u201d Pet. Br. 17.  They advance three theories:  \n(i) that the Court should \u201cadopt [a] categorical rule\u201d \nthat this type of government action \u201calone suffices to \nestablish redressability,\u201d id. at 17, 18; (ii) that redress-\nability follows from the purported \u201cpredictable effects\u201d \nof the 2022 reinstatement on automakers, id. at 18; \nand (iii) that the duration of the challenged waiver, by \nitself, establishes redressability, see id. at 19, 45-47.  \nBut this Court\u2019s precedent forecloses those theories.  \nAnd petitioners\u2019 attempt to argue, in the alternative, \nthat the record contains \u201cplenty [of] evidence\u201d support-\ning redressability (id. at 37) ignores the gulf between \nthe referenced evidence and the question that mat-\ntered:  how automakers would likely have responded \nto a decision vacating the waiver in May 2022.   \n\n \n28 \n \nA. Government Regulations Implicating the \nUse of a Product Do Not Categorically Es-\ntablish Standing for Producers to Sue \nPetitioners first propose a categorical rule that re-\ndressability is automatically established in every chal-\nlenge seeking to \u201cremove a regulatory impediment to \nthe use of petitioners\u2019 products.\u201d  Pet. Br. 17.  They \nnever clarify the scope of the word \u201cimpediment.\u201d  But \nit appears that their rule would cover a flat prohibition \non the use of a product as well as any lesser restriction \nthat allegedly affects or implicates its use.  And the \nrule would apply even where (as here) the record con-\ntains evidence indicating that a favorable judgment \nwould not actually redress the asserted injury.  That \nnovel proposal finds no basis in this Court\u2019s precedent.  \nFor a court to conclude that it has jurisdiction, the \n\u201c\u2018specific facts\u2019\u201d matter\u2014as does the \u201cevidence\u201d sub-\nmitted by the parties.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561. \n1. Petitioners\u2019 proposed rule is at odds \nwith the precedent they invoke \nPetitioners point to Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154 \n(1997), as support for their proposed rule.  Pet. Br. 25-\n26.  That decision reiterated that an injury resulting \nfrom \u201cthe independent action of some third party not \nbefore the court\u201d is insufficient to establish Article III \nstanding.  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 169 (internal quotation \nmarks and emphasis omitted).  It also noted that the \nbar on standing for injuries caused by independent ac-\ntion does not \u201cexclude injury produced by determina-\ntive or coercive effect\u201d of a government action on the \nchoices of a third party.  Id.  Bennett thus confirms the \ncommon-sense proposition that a petitioner is not nec-\nessarily foreclosed from establishing redressability \njust because a third party is \u201cthe very last step in the \n\n \n29 \n \nchain of causation.\u201d  Id.; see also Lujan, 504 U.S. at \n562. \nBut Bennett hardly supports petitioners\u2019 sweeping \ntheory that redressability is automatically established \nwhenever a challenger simply asserts some \u201cregula-\ntory impediment\u201d (Pet. Br. 25) to the use of its product.  \nTo the contrary, the Court\u2019s decision underscores how \nmuch the particular facts of a case matter.  In Bennett, \nranchers and irrigation districts challenged a Fish and \nWildlife Service biological opinion that proposed min-\nimum water levels for a water project.  But a third \nparty (the Bureau of Reclamation) \u201cretain[ed] ulti-\nmate responsibility\u201d for deciding whether to adopt the \nproposal.  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 168.  With respect to \ncausation and redressability, the main question was \nwhether the Bureau would in fact feel constrained to \ndo what the Service suggested.   \nScrutinizing the facts before it, the Court deter-\nmined that\u2014\u201cin reality\u201d\u2014the biological opinion would \nhave a \u201cdeterminative or coercive effect\u201d on the Bu-\nreau\u2019s action.  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 169.  Although the \nopinion was theoretically advisory, the Service had \nacknowledged \u201cthe virtually determinative effect of its \nbiological opinions.\u201d  Id. at 170.  And the Solicitor Gen-\neral conceded that this particular opinion would have \n\u201ca powerful coercive effect\u201d on the Bureau.  Id. at 169.  \nBefore the opinion, the Bureau had operated the water \nproject \u201cin the same manner throughout the 20th cen-\ntury.\u201d  Id. at 170.  But the Bureau had notified the \nService that in the future it \u201cintended to act in accord-\nance with\u201d the recommendations in the Service\u2019s opin-\nion.16  Those facts showed that the opinion (not some \n \n16 Resp. Br., Bennett v. Spear, No. 95-813 (U.S.), 1996 WL 396714, \n(continued\u2026) \n\n \n30 \n \nother motivation) would cause the Bureau to alter its \nbehavior.  And they allowed the Court to hold that pe-\ntitioners\u2019 injury would \u201c\u2018likely\u2019 be redressed\u2014i.e., the \nBureau will not impose [the] water level restrictions\u2014\nif the Biological Opinion is set aside.\u201d  Bennett, 520 \nU.S. at 170-171.   \nThe other cases invoked by petitioners featured \nsimilar factual assessments.  In Pierce v. Society of the \nSisters of the Holy Names of Jesus & Mary, 268 U.S. \n510 (1925), the law prohibiting parents from sending \ntheir children to private schools had \u201ccaused the with-\ndrawal from [the plaintiff\u2019s] schools of children who \nwould otherwise continue.\u201d  Id. at 532 (emphasis \nadded).  In CBS, Inc. v. United States, 316 U.S. 407, \n414, 423 (1942), an affidavit from the plaintiff radio \nnetwork made clear that radio stations were in fact \n\u201ccancelling or threatening to cancel their contracts in \norder to conform to\u201d the challenged regulations.  And \nin Northeastern Florida Chapter of Associated General \nContractors v. City of Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656, 668 \n(1993), standing rested on petitioner\u2019s allegation that \nits members \u201cregularly bid on construction contracts\u201d \nand \u201cwould have bid on contracts\u201d unavailable to them \ndue to the challenged program \u201cwere they so able.\u201d  Be-\ncause those allegations \u201cha[d] not been challenged,\u201d \nthe Court \u201cassum[ed] that they [were] true.\u201d  Id. at \n668-669.17   \n \nat *27 n.14 (July 15, 1996); see also id. at *8; Bennett v. Plenert, \n1993 WL 669429, at *3 (D. Or. Nov. 18, 1993). \n17 Because of the nature of the equal protection right at issue in \nNortheastern Florida, the companies did not need to show that \nthird parties would have selected their bids\u2014just that the com-\npanies were unable to compete on an equal basis.  See, e.g., Gratz \nv. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 244, 262 (2003). \n\n \n31 \n \nNone of those cases supports a categorical rule ex-\ncusing anyone who sells a product from the obligation \nto establish redressability when challenging a regula-\ntion implicating the use of that product.  And the pos-\nture of cases like Bennett and CBS only underscores \nthe deficiency of petitioners\u2019 showing here.  The peti-\ntioners in those cases sought to survive a motion to \ndismiss, and therefore had the \u201crelatively modest\u201d \nburden of advancing \u201c\u2018general factual allegations\u2019\u201d on \nthe elements of standing.  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 168, \n171; see CBS, 316 U.S. at 414, 423; cf. Ne. Fla., 508 \nU.S. at 668-669.  Here, petitioners were seeking to ob-\ntain a final judgment.  So they needed to \u201c\u2018set forth\u2019 by \naffidavit or other evidence \u2018specific facts\u2019\u201d demonstrat-\ning that vacatur would likely redress their injury.  \nBennett, 520 U.S. at 168; see Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.  \nNo amount of after-the-fact theorizing can excuse \ntheir failure to do so.   \nFor similar reasons, Energy Future Coalition v. \nEPA, 793 F.3d 141 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (Kavanaugh, J.), \ndoes not establish standing here.  That case involved \nethanol producers who sought to challenge an EPA \nregulation prohibiting automakers from using fuel \ncontaining 30% ethanol when testing new vehicles.  Id. \nat 143-144.  The court of appeals observed that stand-\ning can be shown where judicial relief \u201cwould remove \na regulatory hurdle\u201d to the use of a petitioner\u2019s prod-\nuct.  Id. at 144; see Pet. Br. 4, 13, 28, 29, 36.  But that \nwas the starting point for the court\u2019s analysis\u2014not the \nfinish line.  Unlike the petitioners here, the challeng-\ners in Energy Future submitted a detailed standing \nanalysis, which included an economist\u2019s explanation of \nhow the regulated parties would react to the sought-\n\n \n32 \n \nafter change.18  The court was therefore able to focus \non actual record evidence establishing \u201csubstantial \nreason to think that at least some vehicle manufactur-\ners would use\u201d the fuel in testing if the challenged reg-\nulation were eliminated.  Energy Future, 793 F.3d at \n144; see also id. at 144 (describing comments from \nFord Motor Company).  And the court expressly dis-\ntinguished the case before it from a case (like this one) \nin which studies and other \u201cobjective evidence directly \nundermined petitioners\u2019 theory of standing.\u201d  Id. at \n145 n.2. \n2. Petitioners\u2019 rule would violate basic \nprinciples of Article III standing \nThat focus on the particular circumstances of the \ncase, and the allegations and evidence before the \ncourt, is compelled by core requirements of Article III. \na.  Federal courts may not exercise jurisdiction \nbased on assumptions or speculation.  See, e.g., Clap-\nper, 568 U.S. at 414; Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better \nEnv\u2019t, 523 U.S. 83, 94 (1998).  After the pleading stage, \nthey must assure themselves that standing exists by \nexamining \u201c\u2018specific facts\u2019\u201d and \u201cevidence\u201d introduced \nby the plaintiff.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561; see All. for \nHippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 384 (noting the \u201cheavily \nfact-dependent\u201d nature of the inquiry).  That obliga-\ntion takes on added significance when the circum-\nstances of a case (or evidence submitted by the \nopposing party) create serious doubts about one of the \nelements of standing.  See generally Hertz Corp., 559 \nU.S. at 96-97. \n \n18 See Pet. Br., Energy Future, No. 14-1123, 2014 WL 5035232, at \n*29-41 (D.C. Cir. Oct. 8, 2014). \n\n \n33 \n \nTo be sure, \u201cthe nature and extent of facts that \nmust be\u201d submitted by a party seeking to challenge \ngovernment action \u201cdepends considerably\u201d on the sur-\nrounding circumstances.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.  A \nplaintiff who is directly regulated by the challenged \naction, for example, may only need to submit evidence \nshowing that it is an object of that regulation, and that \nit would engage in activities proscribed by the regula-\ntion if it were allowed to do so.  Supra p. 16.  Similarly, \nif the action prohibits other companies from using the \nplaintiff\u2019s product, causation and redressability may \nfollow from basic evidence that the plaintiff sells the \nproduct and third-party companies would have used it \nabsent the regulation.  See, e.g., Energy Future, 793 \nF.3d at 144. \nBut observations about the ease of satisfying evi-\ndentiary requirements in certain types of cases do not \namount to a categorical legal rule that \u201csuffices to es-\ntablish redressability\u201d absent evidence.  Pet. Br. 17.  \nAs this Court has explained, presumptions run \nagainst jurisdiction\u2014not in favor of it.  See, e.g., Renne \nv. Geary, 501 U.S. 312, 316 (1991) (\u201cWe presume that \nfederal courts lack jurisdiction unless the contrary ap-\npears affirmatively from the record.\u201d (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted)); see also Kokkonen, 511 U.S. at \n377.   \nA court must therefore examine the facts and evi-\ndence to determine whether\u2014\u201cin reality\u201d\u2014a judgment \naddressing a challenged government action would \nlikely redress a plaintiff\u2019s asserted injury.  Bennett, \n520 U.S. at 169.  For example, if a regulation makes it \nunlawful \u201cfor soda manufacturers to use sugar,\u201d En-\nergy Future, 793 F.3d at 144, a plaintiff may establish \nstanding by pointing to the regulation and introducing \n\n \n34 \n \nevidence that it sells sugar and that some sodas con-\ntain sugar.  But not every case will be that \u201csimple\u201d \n(Pet. Br. 47).  If the regulation instead made it unlaw-\nful only for soda manufacturers to sell more than 80% \nof their beverages with sugar, and the administrative \nrecord established that sugar-free sodas already rep-\nresented 30% of the market before the regulation, that \nplaintiff would have to do more to establish redressa-\nbility. \nAs discussed above, petitioners\u2019 case does not re-\nsemble the \u201csimple\u201d scenarios, primarily because no \none challenged EPA\u2019s initial decision to grant a waiver \nin 2013.  In the ensuing decade, automakers made \nenormous investments in zero-emission vehicles and \nconsumer tastes evolved.  By May 2022, it was not at \nall clear that the presence or absence of the Advanced \nClean Cars I standards would have a determinative or \ncoercive effect on the mix of cars sold by automakers.  \nSee supra pp. 20-22.  Market forces and internal goals \nwere pushing automakers to continue their shift to-\nward electric vehicles, regardless of California\u2019s regu-\nlations.  Pet. App. 24a n.8.  Those circumstances \ndemanded actual evidence showing redressability\u2014\nnot unsupported assertions about \u201ccommon sense and \nbasic economics.\u201d  Pet. Br. 30. \nb.  Petitioners\u2019 contrary arguments demonstrate a \nmisunderstanding of this Court\u2019s precedent.  It is true \n(Pet. Br. 27) that redressability involves \u201cthe relation-\nship between \u2018the judicial relief requested\u2019 and the \u2018in-\njury\u2019 suffered.\u201d  California v. Texas, 593 U.S. 659, 671 \n(2021).  But the necessary relationship is lacking \nwhere the plaintiff fails to prove that \u201cdepress[ed] \nmarket demand\u201d for its product in fact \u201cflows from\u201d \n(Pet. Br. 27) the challenged regulation, and that vaca-\ntur would likely lead to increased demand. \n\n \n35 \n \nPetitioners also contend that, \u201c[a]s far as redressa-\nbility is concerned, . . . Article III\u2019s demands are the \nsame whether the plaintiff is directly or indirectly reg-\nulated.\u201d  Pet. Br. 27.  Justice Scalia long ago rejected \nthat notion in an opinion for the Court.  When a plain-\ntiff is not the direct object of the government action it \nchallenges, \u201cstanding is not precluded, but it is ordi-\nnarily \u2018substantially more difficult\u2019 to establish.\u201d  \nLujan, 504 U.S. at 562.  That is because the plaintiff \nmust \u201cadduce facts\u201d creating a likelihood that the \nthird parties who are directly regulated will make \n\u201cchoices . . . in such manner as to produce causation \nand permit redressability of injury.\u201d  Id.  Petitioners \ndid not do so here. \n3. Petitioners\u2019 policy arguments do not \njustify their rule \nPetitioners eventually resort to a series of \u201cpolicy\u201d \narguments.  Pet. Br. 41; see id. at 41-45.  They first \nargue that the decision below effectively \u201crequire[s] \nthe endorsement of a directly regulated third party be-\nfore an indirectly regulated party can sue.\u201d  Id. at 38.  \nThat would be a problem, they contend, because di-\nrectly regulated entities often will be unwilling or un-\nable to assist indirectly affected challengers.  See id. \nat 42.  But the court of appeals did not require peti-\ntioners to \u201cprovid[e] affidavits from automakers\u201d as a \ncondition of standing.  Id. at 38.  The court\u2019s opinion \nshowed a willingness to consider a variety of other ma-\nterials (if identified by the parties), including com-\nments in the administrative record and public \nstatements from industry participants.  See Pet. App. \n23a-24a, 28a.   \nAnd there are a range of evidentiary sources be-\nyond \u201caffidavits from automakers\u201d that bear on how \nautomakers would likely respond to a vacatur in 2022.  \n\n \n36 \n \nThe state respondents gathered facts relevant to \nstanding from public databases, news articles, securi-\nties and court filings, government reports, and corpo-\nrate announcements.  See, e.g., J.A. 190-206.  Just a \nfew days after the oral argument caused petitioners to \ntake the jurisdictional questions seriously, petitioners \nlocated retired auto executives to file supplemental \ndeclarations that purported to speak authoritatively \nabout automakers\u2019 capabilities and practices.  See J.A. \n213, 218.19  In similar contexts, other litigants have \nrelied on a variety of sources.  See, e.g., C.A. Ohio Br. \nAdd. 37-54 (economist\u2019s declaration); Duke Pwr. Co. v. \nCarolina Envt\u2019l Study Grp., Inc., 438 U.S. 59, 75-76 \n(1978) (congressional testimony); Competitive Enter. \nInst. v. FCC, 970 F.3d 372, 383 (D.C. Cir. 2020) (ex-\npert\u2019s analysis); Competitive Enter. Inst. v. NHTSA, \n901 F.2d 107, 117 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (testimony from ad-\nministrative hearing).   \nThe decision below thus does not \u201ccreat[e] artifi-\ncially high evidentiary barriers.\u201d  Pet. Br. 35.  And it \ndoes not obstruct \u201csuits by unregulated plaintiffs who \nare adversely affected by an agency\u2019s regulation of oth-\ners.\u201d  Corner Post, Inc. v. Bd. of Governors of Fed. Rsrv. \nSys., 603 U.S. 799, 826 (2024) (Kavanaugh, J., concur-\nring).  It simply ensures that any such suits are \n \n19 Those declarations are not before this Court because the court \nof appeals held that petitioners failed to establish good cause for \ntheir untimely filing, see Pet. App. 31a-32a, and petitioners did \nnot seek review of that ruling, see Pet. I; State Opp. 14-15.  In any \nevent, the declarants did not account for 2022 market conditions.  \nSee J.A. 213-222.  As to redressability, they merely asserted that \nautomakers \u201clikely would change their production, pricing, \nand/or distribution plans for Model Year 2025\u201d absent Califor-\nnia\u2019s standards.  J.A. 215, 220.  They offered no supporting de-\ntails, and focused instead on the distinct question of how quickly \nautomakers could change their fleets and prices. \n\n \n37 \n \nbrought by plaintiffs who are, in fact, adversely af-\nfected by the challenged action and would benefit from \na favorable decision.     \nNext, petitioners argue that the \u201cdecision below \ncreates troubling incentives for agencies.\u201d  Pet. Br. 43.  \nThey assert that agencies may now \u201ctarget entire in-\ndustries with crippling burdens so long as they act \nthrough a conduit and placate that conduit.\u201d  Id.20  \nAgain, however, a plaintiff whose sales are crippled as \nthe result of an agency action can invoke numerous \nsources to demonstrate a likelihood that vacatur \nwould increase sales.  Nor does this case present any \nvalid concern about \u201cencourag[ing] agencies to act over \nshorter time horizons.\u201d  Pet. Br. 44.  The underlying \nwaiver was granted in 2013 and addressed standards \nthat increased in stringency through model year 2025.  \nAny jurisdictional difficulties petitioners confronted \nresulted primarily from their own choice not to chal-\nlenge the original 2013 action.  See supra p. 18 n.7. \nFinally, petitioners argue that the court of appeals \n\u201ccreate[d] a one-way ratchet in favor of the regulator \nover the regulated\u201d by requiring petitioners to intro-\nduce evidence of standing.  Pet. Br. 44.  They contrast \nthat requirement with the principle that \u201c[a] State will \n \n20 Petitioners note that several automakers entered voluntary \nagreements with California in 2020 to continue producing more \nlow- and zero-emission vehicles.  See Pet. App. 13a-14a.  But that \nwas not a \u201ctroubling\u201d effort by EPA to \u201cinsulate\u201d the \u201centire in-\ndustr[y]\u201d from \u201creview.\u201d  Pet. Br. 43.  And petitioners \nacknowledge that \u201cmany\u201d other automakers did not enter any \nsuch agreement.  Id. at 37.  Nothing prevented petitioners from \nattempting to introduce evidence showing that the non-partici-\npating automakers would likely change their fleets in response to \na vacatur of the reinstatement. \n\n \n38 \n \nalways have \u2018a legitimate interest in the continued en-\nforceability of its own statutes.\u2019\u201d  Id. (quoting Maine v. \nTaylor, 477 U.S. 131, 137 (1986)).  But state plaintiffs \ndo introduce evidence where necessary to show that a \nfavorable judgment would redress their injuries.  See, \ne.g., Dep\u2019t of Com., 588 U.S. at 767-768.  And this \nCourt\u2019s recognition that sovereigns have a protectable \ninterest in effectuating their own statutes hardly \namounts to \u201cbad policy.\u201d  Pet. Br. 41; see Maryland v. \nKing, 567 U.S. 1301, 1303 (2012) (Roberts, C.J., in \nchambers); Maine, 477 U.S. at 137. \nThe more relevant policy consideration is the one \nunderlying Article III:  that federal courts have lim-\nited jurisdiction, and a party seeking to invoke that \njurisdiction must show that its claim falls within those \nlimits.  That policy, which reflects the Framers\u2019 vision \nof the proper role of courts in our democratic system, \nsee All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 380, requires \naffirmance here.   \nB. Unsupported Predictions About the Effect \nof a Judgment on a Third Party Are Insuf-\nficient to Establish Redressability \nPetitioners\u2019 alternative theory for why they did not \nneed to introduce evidence of redressability fails for \nsimilar reasons.  They contend that plaintiffs can es-\ntablish standing simply by asserting that the \u201ceffects \nof the challenged government action on third parties\u201d \nare \u201cpredictable\u201d\u2014and that \u201cno more is needed.\u201d  Pet. \nBr. 18.  The cases petitioners invoke for that argument \nactually demonstrate the opposite.   \nPetitioners portray Department of Commerce as \nholding that unsupported inferences and predictions \nabout \u201cthird-party behavior . . . can suffice\u201d to estab-\nlish standing.  Pet. Br. 30; see id. at 31.  In truth, that \ndecision examined whether the plaintiffs \u201cha[d] met \n\n \n39 \n \ntheir burden of showing that third parties will likely \nreact in predictable ways\u201d to a citizenship question on \nthe 2020 census, and thereby cause harm to the plain-\ntiffs.  Dep\u2019t of Com., 588 U.S. at 768 (emphasis added).  \nThe Court answered that question in the affirmative \nonly after reviewing the district court\u2019s \u201cfindings of \nfact\u201d\u2014based on extensive \u201cevidence\u201d\u2014which \u201cestab-\nlished a sufficient likelihood that the reinstatement of \na citizenship question\u201d would depress census response \nrates.  Id. at 767; see New York v. Dep\u2019t of Com., 351 F. \nSupp. 3d 502, 578-581 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (describing ex-\npert testimony, statistical data, and agency memo-\nranda).  The Court did not rely on \u201cspeculation\u201d or \npredictions alone.  Dep\u2019t of Com., 588 U.S. at 768.21 \nNor can petitioners dismiss the significance of the \nevidence before the Court in Department of Commerce \non the ground that it merely recounted \u201chistorical \npractice.\u201d  Pet. Br. 31.  The plaintiffs in that case did \nnot just reference the result of questions on prior cen-\nsuses.  They introduced detailed evidence that \u201cover-\nwhelmingly support[ed] the conclusion that the \naddition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census \nwill cause a significant net differential decline in self-\nresponse rates among noncitizen households.\u201d  New \nYork, 351 F. Supp. 3d at 578 (emphasis added). \nThe remaining authorities discussed by petitioners \n(Pet. Br. 31) do not advance their theory either.  The \nstanding analysis in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. \n497, 526 (2007), turned on evidence that included \u201cpe-\ntitioners\u2019 uncontested affidavits.\u201d  That evidence \n \n21 See also California, 593 U.S. at 678 (explaining that the plain-\ntiffs in Department of Commerce \u201crelied not only on \u2018the predict-\nable effect of Government action on the decisions of third parties\u2019 \nbut also on comprehensive studies, rather than mere \u2018specula-\ntion\u2019\u201d). \n\n \n40 \n \nshowed that \u201cthe United States transportation sector \nemit[ted] . . .  more than 6% of worldwide carbon diox-\nide emissions,\u201d id. at 524; that there was \u201ca causal con-\nnection between manmade greenhouse gas emissions \nand global warming,\u201d id. at 523, see id. at 525; and \nthat \u201c[a] reduction in domestic emissions\u201d resulting \nfrom the requested relief \u201cwould slow the pace of \nglobal emissions increases,\u201d providing partial redress \nfor petitioners\u2019 undisputed injuries, id. at 526; see id. \nat 522-523.22  In Skyline Wesleyan Church v. Califor-\nnia Department of Managed Health Care, 968 F.3d \n738, 750 (9th Cir. 2020), the plaintiff similarly offered \n\u201cevidence\u201d that regulatory enforcement had caused \nhealth insurers to abandon restrictions on abortion \ncoverage.  Specifically, \u201cseven insurers had offered \nplans with abortion coverage restrictions\u201d consistent \nwith plaintiff\u2019s religious beliefs, then \u201call seven com-\nplied\u201d with a regulator\u2019s warning to stop offering such \nplans.  Id. at 750.  Both decisions thus turned on ac-\ntual evidence, not unsupported predictions. \nPetitioners nonetheless advance a blanket rule \nthat no evidence is required if \u201cthe behavior of third \nparties is predictable rather than speculative.\u201d  Pet. \nBr. 30.  They further contend that only \u201cthree \ncircumstances\u201d exist in which third-party behavior is \nsufficiently speculative to require evidence of redress-\nability:  (i) where a plaintiff\u2019s theory relies on \u201c\u2018coun-\nterintuitive\u2019 assumptions,\u201d  id. at 32 (citing California, \n593 U.S. at 678); (ii) where it relies on an attenuated \n\u201cchain of events,\u201d Pet. Br. 32 (citing All. for Hippo-\ncratic Med., 602 U.S. at 386); and (iii) where the \u201clegal \nimpact of a judicial decision is unclear,\u201d Pet. Br. 33 \n \n22 The Court also accorded a \u201cspecial solicitude\u201d to the state peti-\ntioners, which does not apply to the private petitioners here.  \nMassachusetts, 549 U.S. at 520. \n\n \n41 \n \n(citing Murthy, 603 U.S. at 72-73, Brackeen, 599 U.S. \nat 294, and Texas, 599 U.S. at 691 (Gorsuch, J., con-\ncurring in the judgment)). \nThose arguments profoundly misunderstand this \nCourt\u2019s standing doctrine.  Challengers must always \nidentify \u201cevidence\u201d proving \u201c\u2018specific facts\u2019\u201d that estab-\nlish standing.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561; see FW/PBS, \nInc. v. City of Dallas, 493 U.S. 215, 231 (1990).  And \nthis Court\u2019s analysis of standing is \u201cnot a \u2018mechanical \nexercise\u2019\u201d\u2014particularly when it comes to suits (like \nthis one) \u201cby unregulated parties against the govern-\nment.\u201d  All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 384.  In \nsome cases, \u201cfamiliar circumstances\u201d make standing \n\u201clikely,\u201d id., and a plaintiff might be able to meet its \nburden with less evidence.  In other cases, like those \nreferenced by petitioners, the Court has pointed to cir-\ncumstances calling for \u201cfar stronger evidence\u201d of cau-\nsation and redressability.  E.g., California, 593 U.S. at \n678.  But those circumstances are not the only ones in \nwhich plaintiffs are required to introduce any evi-\ndence.  \nPetitioners\u2019 own arguments illustrate the folly of \ntheir proposed rule.  Invoking Summers v. Earth Is-\nland Institute, 555 U.S. 488, 494 (2009), petitioners ar-\ngue (Pet. Br. 34) that \u201cit is predictable that when the \ngovernment \u2018regulates parks, national forests, or bod-\nies of water,\u2019 it will affect the users of those natural \nresources.\u201d  \u201cIn all such cases,\u201d id., petitioners assert, \nno \u201c[r]ecord evidence is required,\u201d id. at 30.  But Sum-\nmers held exactly the opposite.  It reiterated that a \nplaintiff \u201cbears the burden of showing that he has \nstanding.\u201d  Summers, 555 U.S. at 493.  The Court in-\nsisted on particular evidence showing that the chal-\nlenged regulations would affect a specific site that at \nleast one of plaintiffs\u2019 members had \u201ca specific and \n\n \n42 \n \nconcrete plan\u201d to visit.  Id. at 495.  And it rejected a \n\u201chitherto unheard-of test\u201d that would premise stand-\ning on a \u201cprobability\u201d that \u201csome (unidentified) mem-\nbers have planned to visit some (unidentified) small \nparcels affected by the Forest Service\u2019s procedures and \nwill suffer (unidentified) concrete harm as a result.\u201d  \nId. at 497-498.  That sort of predictive approach\u2014un-\nsupported by concrete evidence\u2014would \u201cmake a mock-\nery of\u201d the Court\u2019s \u201cprior cases.\u201d  Id. at 498. \nC. The Duration of the Waiver Does Not, By \nItself, Establish Standing \nPetitioners also contend that they were excused \nfrom submitting evidence because the \u201cwaiver for cer-\ntain California standards does not sunset.\u201d  Pet. Br. \n19.  But the fact that the greenhouse-gas standards \nplateau starting in model year 2025, and continue at \nthe same levels in future years, supra p. 6, does not \nchange the analysis.   \n1.  Petitioners reason that because those standards \n\u201cdo not expire,\u201d a judicial vacatur \u201cwould necessarily \nhave some effect on vehicle pricing, production, or dis-\ntribution at some future point.\u201d  Pet. Br. 46 (emphasis \nadded).  This Court has previously rejected that kind \nof reasoning.  See Summers, 555 U.S. at 496 (state-\nments of \u201c\u2018some day\u2019 intentions,\u201d without \u201cany specifi-\ncation of when the some day will be,\u201d are insufficient \nto establish standing); Lujan, 504 U.S. at 564 (same).  \nAnd for good reason.  Statutes and regulations often \ndo not sunset.  The mere longevity of a challenged reg-\nulation is no substitute for \u201cspecific, concrete facts \ndemonstrating that\u201d the plaintiff is harmed by the \ngovernment\u2019s action and \u201cpersonally would benefit in \na tangible way from the court\u2019s intervention.\u201d  Warth, \n422 U.S. at 508. \n\n \n43 \n \nIn this case, moreover, the facts belie petitioners\u2019 \nassertion (Pet. Br. 19) that the duration of the green-\nhouse-gas standards eliminates any \u201cplausible dis-\npute\u201d about redressability.  By the time of this suit, \nsales of battery-electric vehicles far exceeded original \nforecasts, and those vehicles generate an outsized \nnumber of ZEV credits and produce very few green-\nhouse-gas emissions.  See supra pp. 6, 21-22.  Petition-\ners did not submit any evidence that the market would \nreverse course if those standards were no longer in \nplace in future years.  See supra p. 25. \nNor does the court of appeals\u2019 apparent misunder-\nstanding about the temporal scope of the greenhouse-\ngas standards (Pet. Br. 45) compel a different outcome.  \nThe court of appeals lacked jurisdiction because peti-\ntioners failed to introduce evidence showing that au-\ntomakers would likely respond to vacatur by \u201cselling \nfewer non-conventional vehicles or by altering the \nprices of their vehicles such that fewer non-conven-\ntional vehicles\u2014and more conventional vehicles\u2014\nwere sold.\u201d  Pet. App. 22a; see id. at 29a-30a.  The \ncourt\u2019s belief that the challenge before it \u201cconcern[ed] \nonly\u201d the reinstatement of the waiver \u201cas to Model \nYears 2017 through 2025,\u201d was a consideration that \n\u201cfurther complicated\u201d the redressability analysis.  Id. \nat 22a (emphasis added); see id. at 24a.  Setting aside \nthat additional perceived complication does not make \nup for petitioners\u2019 failure to introduce any evidence ad-\ndressing how automakers would likely respond to a \nvacatur in May 2022.  See U.S. Opp. 12-14. \n2.  Relatedly, petitioners fault EPA and the court \nof appeals for the court\u2019s \u201cincorrect\u201d premise about the \nduration of the waiver, Pet. Br. 45, which they contend \ncaused the court to improperly \u201cconflate[] mootness \n\n \n44 \n \nand redressability,\u201d id. at 39.  Those arguments are \npuzzling. \nIt has never been a secret that California\u2019s \u201cgreen-\nhouse-gas emission standards applied to model year \n2025 \u2018and subsequent.\u2019\u201d  Pet. Br. 45-46 (quoting J.A. \n50).  That was plainly described in the California Code \nof Regulations. See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, \n\u00a7 1961.3(a)(1)(A); see also Cal. Code Regs., tit. 13, \n\u00a7 1962.2(b)(1)(A) (2012) (similar wording in originally \nenacted ZEV provision).  Petitioners imply that the \nlower court\u2019s confusion about the duration of the \nwaiver arose because EPA failed to \u201ccandidly ex-\nplain[]\u201d the matter until the certiorari stage.  Pet. Br. \n45; see id. at 46.  But the more likely culprit was peti-\ntioners\u2019 opening brief below, which told the court that \npetitioners were challenging a program \u201ccover[ing] ve-\nhicles from model years 2015 through 2025.\u201d  C.A. Pri-\nvate Pet. Br. 9; see also C.A. Oral Arg. 33:55-34:13 \n(argument of petitioners\u2019 counsel that, to defeat stand-\ning, \u201cthe Government would need to come forward \nwith some evidence that [automakers have] now \nplanned around the restatement in a way that couldn\u2019t \nbe withdrawn by 2025\u201d). \nThe lack of clarity on this point was perhaps un-\nderstandable:  petitioners\u2019 central focus in this case \nhas always been on the ZEV standards, which will ex-\npire after model year 2025.  Pet. Br. 46.  That may be \nwhy petitioners urged this Court to resolve the merits \nof their statutory claim before \u201cCalifornia\u2019s waiver ex-\npires at the end of model year 2025,\u201d Pet. 26, even af-\nter they had belatedly acknowledged that the \ngreenhouse-gas standards apply to \u201cModel Years \n\u20182025 and subsequent,\u2019\u201d C.A. Private Pet. Proposed \nSupp. Br. 5.  But whatever the source of the confusion \n\n \n45 \n \nbelow, it did not matter to the ultimate outcome.  Re-\ngardless of the waiver\u2019s duration, petitioners failed to \nshow that automakers would respond to its reinstate-\nment (either sooner or later) by making changes that \nwould increase fuel sales.   \nIn the face of that failure, the court of appeals cor-\nrectly explained why its decision was based on stand-\ning, not mootness:  The jurisdictional problem was not \nthat petitioners\u2019 \u201cstanding arguments were sufficient \nwhen originally filed\u201d and then were \u201cmooted by the \npassage of time.\u201d  Pet. App. 25a; see generally Already, \nLLC v. Nike, Inc., 568 U.S. 85, 91 (2013).  Petitioners\u2019 \n\u201cstanding arguments were deficient from the start.\u201d  \nPet. App. 25a.  By the time petitioners filed their chal-\nlenge in May 2022, shifts in consumer demand and \nother transformations in the market made it specula-\ntive (at best) that vacating the reinstatement would \nlead to increased fuel sales in the future.  Petitioners \nnever even attempted to introduce evidence demon-\nstrating that vacatur of the reinstatement would have \nthe effects on automakers that they predicted.  Pet. \nApp. 29a-30a.   \nD. Petitioners\u2019 Post Hoc Attempts to Identify \nEvidence on Redressability Fail to Estab-\nlish Standing \nFinally, petitioners argue that if they \u201cwere legally \nrequired to produce record evidence to support re-\ndressability, plenty such evidence existed.\u201d  Pet. \nBr. 37.  But the few documents that petitioners cited \nin the court of appeals did not establish any likelihood \nthat a vacatur in 2022 would increase fuel sales, as \ndetailed in Part I.C above.  And the additional materi-\nals petitioners now point this Court to would not have \nestablished redressability even if petitioners had in-\nvoked them in a timely fashion below. \n\n \n46 \n \nPetitioners first highlight (Pet. Br. 38) a statement \nfrom an appendix to California\u2019s 2021 comment letter \nregarding the reinstatement.  See J.A. 84.  But that \nstatement relied on forecasts from 2017.  See J.A. 85 \nn.17 (citing January 2017 analysis of regulation com-\npliance scenarios); id. at 85 n.18 (citing February 2017 \nmodeling scenario).  By 2022, the earlier projections \nhad been overtaken by actual events.  See J.A. 191 (na-\ntional market share of zero-emission vehicles \u201calmost \ntripled\u201d in the period \u201cbetween 2020 and the third \nquarter of 2022\u201d). \nPetitioners also invoke declarations that the state \nrespondents filed along with their motion to intervene, \nshortly after petitioners initiated this suit.  See Pet. \nBr. 13, 34.  Those declarations (like petitioners\u2019) as-\nserted a conclusory \u201cexpect[ation]\u201d that additional \ngasoline-fueled vehicles would be sold if California\u2019s \nstandards were not in place.  J.A. 110, 111; see id. at \n115-116.  The lack of any details or contemporaneous \nevidence for those assertions reflected both time con-\nstraints (the intervention declarations were signed \nfour days after the case commenced) and the reality \nthat the States\u2019 standing and entitlement to intervene \nwere independently established for other reasons.  Cf. \nKing, 567 U.S. at 1303 (reasoning that a State suffers \n\u201congoing irreparable harm\u201d any time it \u201cis enjoined by \na court from effectuating . . . a duly enacted statute\u201d). \nAnother document referenced by petitioners (Pet. \nBr. 47) is outside the record and post-dates the deci-\nsion below:  EPA\u2019s recent request for public comment \non its proposal to incorporate the greenhouse-gas \nstandards of the Advanced Clean Cars I program into \nCalifornia\u2019s state implementation plan.  See 89 Fed. \nReg. 82,553 (Oct. 11, 2024); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7407.  To be \nsure, the underlying state estimates referenced in that \n\n \n47 \n \nproposal (see 89 Fed. Reg. at 82,557 & nn.19-20) are \npart of the record, because California submitted them \nto EPA in 2021 in connection with the reinstatement \nproceedings.  See C.A. J.A. 276.  But petitioners never \ninvoked those submissions below.  And the estimates \ntook as their baseline a projection of zero-emission ve-\nhicle penetration based on 2019 data, which did not \nanticipate the dramatic increase in sales in the follow-\ning years.23   \nNone of the materials that petitioners belatedly \nreference could have satisfied their burden to submit \nevidence about how the market would respond to va-\ncatur of the reinstatement in May 2022.  And the fact \nthat they were not \u201cset forth\u201d as \u201cthe basis for the \nclaim of standing\u201d below poses another insuperable \nobstacle for petitioners.  D.C. Cir. R. 28(a)(7).  As this \nCourt recently reminded litigants, \u201c\u2018judges are not like \npigs, hunting for truffles buried in the record.\u2019\u201d  \nMurthy, 603 U.S. at 67 n.7 (alterations omitted).  The \ncourt of appeals could not reasonably be expected to \nfocus on a few sentences scattered across thousands of \npages of record materials, which were never raised in \npetitioners\u2019 briefs.  Nor could it be expected to recall \nisolated assertions in two declarations, filed in support \nof one of five unopposed motions to intervene, that \nwere disposed of by the Clerk more than a year before \noral argument.  See C.A. Order (June 30, 2022). \nIn the end, petitioners are right that this case is \n\u201csimple\u201d (Pet. Br. 47)\u2014but not in the way they sug-\ngest.  They had the burden to introduce evidence es-\ntablishing that their claim was redressable.  Instead \n \n23  See C.A. J.A. 277 (explaining reliance on \u201cEMFAC 2021\u201d \nmodel); Cal. Air Res. Bd., EMFAC 2021 Volume III Technical \nDocument, at 6 (April 2021), https://tinyurl.com/2wsxz4uy (ex-\nplaining use of DMV data through 2019). \n\n \n48 \n \nof meeting that obligation head-on, they treated re-\ndressability as an afterthought\u2014relying on assump-\ntions and conclusory assertions, supplemented only by \noutdated projections.  And when confronted with cur-\nrent evidence from the state respondents undermining \ntheir assumption that vacatur of the reinstatement in \nMay 2022 would lead to increased fuel sales, petition-\ners offered no evidentiary response.  Because petition-\ners failed to introduce specific facts and evidence \nestablishing a likelihood of redressability, the court of \nappeals properly held that it could not reach the mer-\nits. \n\n \n49 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be af-\nfirmed. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \nROB BONTA \nAttorney General of California \nMICHAEL J.
