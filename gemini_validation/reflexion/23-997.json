      "Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, does a former employee \u2014 who was qualified to perform her job and who earned post-employment benefits while employed \u2014 lose her right to sue over discrimination with respect to those benefits solely because she no longer holds her job?"

    "facts_of_the_case": "Karyn Stanley, a firefighter for the City of Sanford, Florida, retired due to Parkinson's disease in 2018 after serving for about 19 years. When she joined in 1999, the City's policy provided free health insurance until age 65 for employees retiring due to disability. However, in 2003, the City changed its plan, limiting the health insurance subsidy for disability retirees to 24 months post-retirement. Unaware of this change, Stanley filed suit in April 2020, shortly before her subsidy was set to expire, alleging violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act, Rehabilitation Act, Florida Civil Rights Act, Equal Protection Clause, and Florida Statutes section 112.0801. The district court dismissed or granted summary judgment on all claims in favor of the City, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed, relying on (and reaffirming) binding precedent within that circuit that \u201ca Title I plaintiff must \u2018hold[ ] or desire[ ]\u2019 an employment position with the defendant at the time of the defendant's allegedly wrongful act.\u201d",

Shell Oil Co.*. This initial analysis forms a strong, testable hypothesis (that the Court will reverse the Eleventh Circuit) and provides a clear roadmap for subsequent research, significantly advancing the agent's understanding of this specific case.\n\nDesign EIG is also high (0.7) because this action models a generalizable and effective strategy for SCOTUS prediction: 1) identify the core issue and circuit split, 2) analyze the statutory purpose and potential consequences of the lower court's ruling, 3) find analogous precedents from related areas of law (like Title VII for an ADA case), and 4) plan to examine the primary briefs. This workflow is a valuable template for future prediction tasks.\n\nThe combination of strong case-specific analysis and a robust, repeatable methodology makes this an action with very high overall information gain.",

Moving from a general understanding of the legal question to a detailed grasp of the petitioner's arguments is a massive leap in understanding the specific task. This information is essential for analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of the petitioner's position and is a prerequisite for a well-reasoned prediction.\n\n- **Design EIG (0.3):** This action confirms a core, but standard, part of the legal analysis strategy: start by reading the primary briefs. While it reinforces the importance and timing of this step, it doesn't offer novel insights into new or better strategies for SCOTUS prediction. It's a foundational, not an exploratory, action. The gain is in confirming the high value of a known-good step.\n\n- **Joint EIG (1.2):** The overall value is high, driven almost entirely by the critical importance of this information for the specific task of predicting the outcome of this case.",

Or a \nuniversity that pays a pension to former employees, but \nnot if they\u2019re Jewish. Such blatant discrimination is \nunquestionably actionable under Title VII of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964. No court would entertain the notion \nthat former employees are barred from challenging these \nodious policies solely because they no longer hold their \njobs. To the contrary, this Court has unanimously held \nthat Title VII\u2019s protections extend to former employees. \nRobinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337 (1997).  \nThe Americans with Disabilities Act is no different. \nCongress explicitly modeled the ADA on Title VII. It \nconferred Title VII\u2019s full \u201cpowers, remedies, and \nprocedures\u201d on ADA plaintiffs, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12117(a), and \nestablished comprehensive \u201ccivil rights protections for \npersons with disabilities that are parallel to\u201d Title VII. \nH.R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 3, at 48 (1990).  \nIn this case, the Eleventh Circuit upended Congress\u2019s \ndesign by holding that a retired firefighter disabled in the \nline of duty may be subjected to discrimination with \nimpunity. That holding is fundamentally mistaken in two \nrespects, each of which independently warrants reversal. \n \nFirst, the court misread what the ADA, as amended \nby the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, says about who may \nsue, what they may sue over, and when they may sue.  \nThe ADA\u2019s enforcement provision tells us who may \nsue: \u201cany person alleging discrimination on the basis of \ndisability in violation of [the Act].\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12117(a). \nThat does not exclude retirees.  \n\n- 2 - \n \nThe statute also tells us what retirees may sue over: \nthe ADA, like Title VII, bans discrimination in \n\u201ccompensation\u201d and \u201cterms, conditions, and privileges of \nemployment\u201d\u2014words this Court has long read to include \npost-employment benefits over which retirees may sue. \nHishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U.S. 69, 77 (1984).  \nAnd, most importantly, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay \nAct clarifies when discrimination occurs and when a \nplaintiff may sue: when a benefits policy is \u201cadopted,\u201d or \nwhen the plaintiff \u201cbecomes subject to\u201d it, or when the \nplaintiff \u201cis affected by\u201d it. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A). \nThe ADA thus prohibits discrimination on the basis of \ndisability in the provision of a benefit earned during a \nplaintiff\u2019s employment\u2014even if the plaintiff does not \nreceive that benefit until she is no longer employed. \nTogether, these provisions\u2014who, what, when\u2014make \nclear that the Eleventh Circuit was wrong to preclude the \npetitioner here from invoking the ADA\u2019s protections. The \nallegedly discriminatory policy at issue was adopted in \n2003, while Lt. Karyn Stanley was still employed and able \nto perform her job as a firefighter and was therefore \nindisputably what the statute calls a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d \nThus, even if she needed to be employed when the alleged \ndiscrimination occurred\u2014as the court below erroneously \nconcluded\u2014she was, and her suit may proceed. \nSecond, the Eleventh Circuit erred in holding that \nretirees are not \u201cqualified individuals\u201d under the ADA. \nA \u201cqualified individual means an individual who, with \nor without reasonable accommodation, can perform the \nessential functions of the employment position that such \nindividual holds or desires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2111(8). The court \nof appeals read this to mean that one must \u201chold or desire\u201d \na job. But that isn\u2019t what the statute says and, at the very \n\n- 3 - \n \nleast, isn\u2019t a reading demanded by the statute\u2019s words or \nsyntax. To see why, try some examples:   \n\u2022 \u201cA \u2018cleared passenger\u2019 means a passenger who can \ncomplete an x-ray screening of the luggage that \nsuch passenger carries or checks. Only \u2018cleared \npassengers\u2019 may board the aircraft.\u201d Can you get \non the plane if you don\u2019t have any bags?  \n\u2022 \u201cYou must silence your cell phone to visit the \nlibrary.\u201d May you visit if you didn\u2019t bring a phone?  \n\u2022 \u201cTo live in this apartment building, you must be \nable to clean up after the pets that you own.\u201d If you \ndon\u2019t own a pet, may you live in the building? \nIn each case, we naturally understand this language to \nmean that certain requirements apply conditionally\u2014only \nif the relevant condition (carrying luggage, bringing a \nphone, owning pets) is met does it trigger an obligation \n(screen bags, silence your phone, clean up). In the pets \nexample, \u201cthat you own\u201d tells us which pets\u2014the ones you \nown. The \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition works the same \nway: It requires you to be able to perform the functions of \na job only to the extent that you \u201chold\u201d or \u201cdesire\u201d one. \nBut nothing in the text requires that you currently \n\u201chold\u201d or \u201cdesire\u201d a job. It would be eccentric to read the \npets rule to mean: \u201cYou must own a pet.\u201d But that\u2019s akin \nto what the court did here. It rewrote the statute to impose \ntwo requirements rather than one: you (a) must hold or \ndesire a job and (b) must be able to perform its functions. \nThis redrafting transforms how the statute works. The \nADA prohibits discrimination \u201cagainst a qualified \nindividual on the basis of disability.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12112(a). The \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition\u2019s role in the statutory \nscheme is to make clear that employers don\u2019t violate that \n\n- 4 - \n \nrule when they make necessary job-related decisions\u2014\ninsisting that a lifeguard be able to swim, for example. The \ndefinition is not there, however, to arbitrarily exclude \nentire categories of people from the Act\u2019s protection.  \nTo be sure, we concede that syntax alone doesn\u2019t \nanswer the question, and that Congress could have been \nclearer. But \u201cin its legal context,\u201d Pulsifer v. United \nStates, 601 U.S. 124, 141 (2024), the definition is best read \nto require that, to the extent that an individual holds a job, \nthey must be able to perform its essential functions. That \nreading aligns with common usage, grammar, and logic, as \nwell as the ADA\u2019s text, structure, and purpose. It \nharmonizes the ADA with Title VII, as Congress \nintended. It avoids unnecessary surplusage. And it avoids \nthe absurd result of leaving retirees unprotected against \neven the most egregious discrimination in the distribution \nof valuable benefits that they earned during their careers.  \nThe consequences of the contrary reading are starkly \nillustrated here. Lt. Stanley served as a firefighter for \nnearly two decades, risking life and limb to protect her \ncommunity. The benefits she seeks to protect were earned \nthrough years of dedicated, dangerous service. Yet under \nthe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s rule, she loses protections that \nwould have safeguarded those benefits\u2014at the moment \nthe protections matter most. This perverse outcome would \npull the rug out from under firefighters, police officers, \nteachers, and others who become disabled through years \nof service to their communities and country.  \nCongress never enacted this arbitrary regime, which \nmakes outright discrimination unlawful up until an \nemployee\u2019s last day of work\u2014and then perfectly lawful \nthe moment she clocks out for the last time. This Court \nshould reverse. \n\n- 5 - \n \nOPINIONS BELOW  \nThe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s opinion is reported at 83 F.4th \n1333 and reproduced at App. 1. The district court\u2019s order \nis unreported but is available at 2021 WL 6333059 and \nreproduced at App. 20. \nJURISDICTIONAL STATEMENT \nThis Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nThe Eleventh Circuit entered judgment on October 11, \n2023. A petition was timely filed on March 8, 2024, and the \nCourt granted certiorari on June 24, 2024. \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED  \nThe relevant provisions of the ADA are reproduced in \na statutory appendix to this brief.  \nSTATEMENT  \nA. \nStatutory background  \n\u201cCongress enacted the ADA in 1990 to remedy \nwidespread discrimination against disabled individuals.\u201d \nPGA Tour, Inc. v. Martin, 532 U.S. 661, 674 (2001). \nCongress found that, \u201chistorically, society has tended to \nisolate and segregate individuals with disabilities,\u201d and \n\u201cdespite some improvements,\u201d that discrimination \n\u201ccontinue[d] to be a serious and pervasive social problem.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(a)(2). It \u201cpersist[ed] in such critical \nareas as employment,\u201d \u201caccess to public services,\u201d and \n\u201cpublic accommodations,\u201d among others. Id. \u00a7 12101(a)(3). \nIn view of those findings, the ADA provides \u201ca clear \nand comprehensive national mandate for the elimination \nof discrimination against individuals with disabilities\u201d with \n\u201cclear, \nstrong, \nconsistent, \nenforceable \nstandards \naddressing discrimination.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12101(b)(1)\u2013(2). And \n\u201c[t]o effectuate its sweeping purpose, the ADA forbids \ndiscrimination against disabled individuals in major areas \n\n- 6 - \n \nof public life,\u201d including, in Title I, employment. Martin, \n532 U.S. at 675. \n1. Title I\u2019s discrimination provision. In keeping with \nthe ADA\u2019s \u201cbroad mandate\u201d and \u201ccomprehensive\u201d \napproach, Martin, 532 U.S. at 675, Title I establishes an \nexpansive approach to what constitutes disability \ndiscrimination in employment. \na. The general rule. Section 12112 sets out a \u201cgeneral \nrule\u201d governing discrimination: \u201c[N]o covered entity shall \ndiscriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of \ndisability in regard to job application procedures, the \nhiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee \ncompensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, \nand privileges of employment.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a). This \nreaches discrimination from before employment begins \n(\u201capplication procedures\u201d and \u201chiring\u201d) through in-role \nperformance \n(\u201cadvancement\u201d) \nto \ntermination \n(\u201cdischarge\u201d) and all the way through to post-employment \nbenefits that \u201caccrue\u201d after \u201ca person\u2019s employment is \ncompleted.\u201d Hishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U.S. 69, 77 \n(1984) (interpreting Title VII). As this Court put it when \ninterpreting identical language in Title VII, \u201c[t]here is no \nquestion\u201d that this prohibition extends to cover \n\u201cretirement benefits.\u201d Ariz. Governing Comm. for Tax \nDeferred Annuity & Deferred Comp. Plans v. Norris, 463 \nU.S. 1073, 1081 (1983) (Marshall, J., joined by Brennan, \nWhite, Stevens, and O\u2019Connor, JJ.). The upshot of this \ncomprehensive list of the \u201cincidents of employment\u201d is \nthat, if something is \u201cpart and parcel of the employment \nrelationship,\u201d the ADA shields it from discrimination. \nHishon, 467 U.S. at 75. \nb. The construction provision. Title I couples the \nreach of its \u201cgeneral rule\u201d with a flexible \u201c[c]onstruction\u201d \nprovision that explains what \u201c\u2018discriminate against a \n\n- 7 - \n \nqualified individual on the basis of disability [in the \ngeneral rule] includes.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b). That \nprovision makes clear that, like all anti-discrimination \nstatutes, Title I prohibits animus-based disparate \ntreatment. See, e.g., id. \u00a7 12112(b)(1). It also reaches \npolicies that have a disparate impact on people with \ndisabilities, specifically singling out \u201cstandards, criteria, \nor methods of administration that have the effect of \ndiscrimination on the basis of disability,\u201d id. \u00a7 \n12112(b)(3)(A), and \u201cstandards\u201d that \u201ctend to screen \nout \u2026 a class of individuals with disabilities,\u201d id. \u00a7 \n12112(b)(6). \nBut, unlike most other anti-discrimination statutes, \nthe ADA doesn\u2019t equate \u201cdiscriminate\u201d with an equal-\ntreatment mandate. Instead, it at times requires \n\u201cpreferential[]\u201d treatment to \u201cachieve [its] basic equal \nopportunity goal.\u201d US Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. \n391, 397 (2002). The \u201cconstruction\u201d provision accomplishes \nthis by defining \u201cdiscriminate\u201d to include the failure to \nprovide a \u201creasonable accommodation.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A). This affirmative mandate can demand \nsignificant changes: \u201cjob restructuring,\u201d \u201cmodified work \nschedules,\u201d \n\u201creassignment,\u201d \nthe \nmodification \nof \nequipment and \u201cfacilities\u201d to make them \u201creadily \naccessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities,\u201d \nand \u201cother similar accommodations.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12111(9). \nc. The \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition. While the \nsweep of the discrimination provision demonstrates the \nADA\u2019s \nplan \nto \naggressively \nroot \nout \ndisability \ndiscrimination in employment, Congress also sought to \nensure that Title I would not \u201cdemand action beyond the \nrealm of the reasonable.\u201d Barnett, 535 U.S. at 401. A \nnumber of its provisions thus balance the Act\u2019s ambitions \nagainst employers\u2019 legitimate interests: The Act requires \n\n- 8 - \n \nonly \u201creasonable\u201d accommodations and carves out \naccommodations that impose \u201cundue hardship\u201d on \nemployers, see, e.g., 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A), and it \nprovides a \u201cbusiness necessity\u201d defense against disparate-\nimpact discrimination stemming from \u201cstandards, tests, \nor selection criteria,\u201d id. \u00a7 12113(a). \nChief among these provisions is the general rule\u2019s \nprohibition \nof \ndiscrimination \nagainst \n\u201cqualified \nindividuals.\u201d A \u201cqualified individual\u201d is defined as \u201can \nindividual \nwho, \nwith \nor \nwithout \nreasonable \naccommodation, can perform the essential functions of the \nemployment position that such individual holds or \ndesires.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12111(8). The role of this definition\u2014and its \nplacement in the general rule\u2014is to \u201creaffirm\u201d that Title \nI \u201cdoes not undermine an employer\u2019s ability to choose and \nmaintain qualified workers.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 2, \nat 55 (1990). An employer, for instance, may refuse to hire \nsomeone whose disability prevents them (even with the \nbenefit of an accommodation) from \u201clift[ing] fifty pounds\u201d \nif doing so is necessary for performing the job. H.R. Rep. \nNo. 101-485, at 56. Title I thus allows employers cabined \nauthority to act on the basis of disability; they may do so \nonly to ensure that the people they hire can perform the \ncore, or \u201cessential,\u201d functions of the job at issue\u2014a limited \nrole that the definition of \u201cqualified individual\u201d \nunderscores by requiring deference to the \u201cemployer\u2019s \njudgment as to what functions of a job are es\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Or a \nuniversity that pays a pension to former employees, but \nnot if they\u2019re Jewish. Such blatant discrimination is \nunquestionably actionable under Title VII of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964. No court would entertain the notion \nthat former employees are barred from challenging these \nodious policies solely because they no longer hold their \njobs. To the contrary, this Court has unanimously held \nthat Title VII\u2019s protections extend to former employees. \nRobinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337 (1997).  \nThe Americans with Disabilities Act is no different. \nCongress explicitly modeled the ADA on Title VII. It \nconferred Title VII\u2019s full \u201cpowers, remedies, and \nprocedures\u201d on ADA plaintiffs, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12117(a), and \nestablished comprehensive \u201ccivil rights protections for \npersons with disabilities that are parallel to\u201d Title VII. \nH.R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 3, at 48 (1990).  \nIn this case, the Eleventh Circuit upended Congress\u2019s \ndesign by holding that a retired firefighter disabled in the \nline of duty may be subjected to discrimination with \nimpunity. That holding is fundamentally mistaken in two \nrespects, each of which independently warrants reversal. \n \nFirst, the court misread what the ADA, as amended \nby the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, says about who may \nsue, what they may sue over, and when they may sue.  \nThe ADA\u2019s enforcement provision tells us who may \nsue: \u201cany person alleging discrimination on the basis of \ndisability in violation of [the Act].\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12117(a). \nThat does not exclude retirees.  \n\n- 2 - \n \nThe statute also tells us what retirees may sue over: \nthe ADA, like Title VII, bans discrimination in \n\u201ccompensation\u201d and \u201cterms, conditions, and privileges of \nemployment\u201d\u2014words this Court has long read to include \npost-employment benefits over which retirees may sue. \nHishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U.S. 69, 77 (1984).  \nAnd, most importantly, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay \nAct clarifies when discrimination occurs and when a \nplaintiff may sue: when a benefits policy is \u201cadopted,\u201d or \nwhen the plaintiff \u201cbecomes subject to\u201d it, or when the \nplaintiff \u201cis affected by\u201d it. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A). \nThe ADA thus prohibits discrimination on the basis of \ndisability in the provision of a benefit earned during a \nplaintiff\u2019s employment\u2014even if the plaintiff does not \nreceive that benefit until she is no longer employed. \nTogether, these provisions\u2014who, what, when\u2014make \nclear that the Eleventh Circuit was wrong to preclude the \npetitioner here from invoking the ADA\u2019s protections. The \nallegedly discriminatory policy at issue was adopted in \n2003, while Lt. Karyn Stanley was still employed and able \nto perform her job as a firefighter and was therefore \nindisputably what the statute calls a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d \nThus, even if she needed to be employed when the alleged \ndiscrimination occurred\u2014as the court below erroneously \nconcluded\u2014she was, and her suit may proceed. \nSecond, the Eleventh Circuit erred in holding that \nretirees are not \u201cqualified individuals\u201d under the ADA. \nA \u201cqualified individual means an individual who, with \nor without reasonable accommodation, can perform the \nessential functions of the employment position that such \nindividual holds or desires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2111(8). The court \nof appeals read this to mean that one must \u201chold or desire\u201d \na job. But that isn\u2019t what the statute says and, at the very \n\n- 3 - \n \nleast, isn\u2019t a reading demanded by the statute\u2019s words or \nsyntax. To see why, try some examples:   \n\u2022 \u201cA \u2018cleared passenger\u2019 means a passenger who can \ncomplete an x-ray screening of the luggage that \nsuch passenger carries or checks. Only \u2018cleared \npassengers\u2019 may board the aircraft.\u201d Can you get \non the plane if you don\u2019t have any bags?  \n\u2022 \u201cYou must silence your cell phone to visit the \nlibrary.\u201d May you visit if you didn\u2019t bring a phone?  \n\u2022 \u201cTo live in this apartment building, you must be \nable to clean up after the pets that you own.\u201d If you \ndon\u2019t own a pet, may you live in the building? \nIn each case, we naturally understand this language to \nmean that certain requirements apply conditionally\u2014only \nif the relevant condition (carrying luggage, bringing a \nphone, owning pets) is met does it trigger an obligation \n(screen bags, silence your phone, clean up). In the pets \nexample, \u201cthat you own\u201d tells us which pets\u2014the ones you \nown. The \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition works the same \nway: It requires you to be able to perform the functions of \na job only to the extent that you \u201chold\u201d or \u201cdesire\u201d one. \nBut nothing in the text requires that you currently \n\u201chold\u201d or \u201cdesire\u201d a job. It would be eccentric to read the \npets rule to mean: \u201cYou must own a pet.\u201d But that\u2019s akin \nto what the court did here. It rewrote the statute to impose \ntwo requirements rather than one: you (a) must hold or \ndesire a job and (b) must be able to perform its functions. \nThis redrafting transforms how the statute works. The \nADA prohibits discrimination \u201cagainst a qualified \nindividual on the basis of disability.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12112(a). The \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition\u2019s role in the statutory \nscheme is to make clear that employers don\u2019t violate that \n\n- 4 - \n \nrule when they make necessary job-related decisions\u2014\ninsisting that a lifeguard be able to swim, for example. The \ndefinition is not there, however, to arbitrarily exclude \nentire categories of people from the Act\u2019s protection.  \nTo be sure, we concede that syntax alone doesn\u2019t \nanswer the question, and that Congress could have been \nclearer. But \u201cin its legal context,\u201d Pulsifer v. United \nStates, 601 U.S. 124, 141 (2024), the definition is best read \nto require that, to the extent that an individual holds a job, \nthey must be able to perform its essential functions. That \nreading aligns with common usage, grammar, and logic, as \nwell as the ADA\u2019s text, structure, and purpose. It \nharmonizes the ADA with Title VII, as Congress \nintended. It avoids unnecessary surplusage. And it avoids \nthe absurd result of leaving retirees unprotected against \neven the most egregious discrimination in the distribution \nof valuable benefits that they earned during their careers.  \nThe consequences of the contrary reading are starkly \nillustrated here. Lt. Stanley served as a firefighter for \nnearly two decades, risking life and limb to protect her \ncommunity. The benefits she seeks to protect were earned \nthrough years of dedicated, dangerous service. Yet under \nthe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s rule, she loses protections that \nwould have safeguarded those benefits\u2014at the moment \nthe protections matter most. This perverse outcome would \npull the rug out from under firefighters, police officers, \nteachers, and others who become disabled through years \nof service to their communities and country.  \nCongress never enacted this arbitrary regime, which \nmakes outright discrimination unlawful up until an \nemployee\u2019s last day of work\u2014and then perfectly lawful \nthe moment she clocks out for the last time. This Court \nshould reverse. \n\n- 5 - \n \nOPINIONS BELOW  \nThe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s opinion is reported at 83 F.4th \n1333 and reproduced at App. 1. The district court\u2019s order \nis unreported but is available at 2021 WL 6333059 and \nreproduced at App. 20. \nJURISDICTIONAL STATEMENT \nThis Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nThe Eleventh Circuit entered judgment on October 11, \n2023. A petition was timely filed on March 8, 2024, and the \nCourt granted certiorari on June 24, 2024. \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED  \nThe relevant provisions of the ADA are reproduced in \na statutory appendix to this brief.  \nSTATEMENT  \nA. \nStatutory background  \n\u201cCongress enacted the ADA in 1990 to remedy \nwidespread discrimination against disabled individuals.\u201d \nPGA Tour, Inc. v. Martin, 532 U.S. 661, 674 (2001). \nCongress found that, \u201chistorically, society has tended to \nisolate and segregate individuals with disabilities,\u201d and \n\u201cdespite some improvements,\u201d that discrimination \n\u201ccontinue[d] to be a serious and pervasive social problem.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(a)(2). It \u201cpersist[ed] in such critical \nareas as employment,\u201d \u201caccess to public services,\u201d and \n\u201cpublic accommodations,\u201d among others. Id. \u00a7 12101(a)(3). \nIn view of those findings, the ADA provides \u201ca clear \nand comprehensive national mandate for the elimination \nof discrimination against individuals with disabilities\u201d with \n\u201cclear, \nstrong, \nconsistent, \nenforceable \nstandards \naddressing discrimination.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12101(b)(1)\u2013(2). And \n\u201c[t]o effectuate its sweeping purpose, the ADA forbids \ndiscrimination against disabled individuals in major areas \n\n- 6 - \n \nof public life,\u201d including, in Title I, employment. Martin, \n532 U.S. at 675. \n1. Title I\u2019s discrimination provision. In keeping with \nthe ADA\u2019s \u201cbroad mandate\u201d and \u201ccomprehensive\u201d \napproach, Martin, 532 U.S. at 675, Title I establishes an \nexpansive approach to what constitutes disability \ndiscrimination in employment. \na. The general rule. Section 12112 sets out a \u201cgeneral \nrule\u201d governing discrimination: \u201c[N]o covered entity shall \ndiscriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of \ndisability in regard to job application procedures, the \nhiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee \ncompensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, \nand privileges of employment.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a). This \nreaches discrimination from before employment begins \n(\u201capplication procedures\u201d and \u201chiring\u201d) through in-role \nperformance \n(\u201cadvancement\u201d) \nto \ntermination \n(\u201cdischarge\u201d) and all the way through to post-employment \nbenefits that \u201caccrue\u201d after \u201ca person\u2019s employment is \ncompleted.\u201d Hishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U.S. 69, 77 \n(1984) (interpreting Title VII). As this Court put it when \ninterpreting identical language in Title VII, \u201c[t]here is no \nquestion\u201d that this prohibition extends to cover \n\u201cretirement benefits.\u201d Ariz. Governing Comm. for Tax \nDeferred Annuity & Deferred Comp. Plans v. Norris, 463 \nU.S. 1073, 1081 (1983) (Marshall, J., joined by Brennan, \nWhite, Stevens, and O\u2019Connor, JJ.). The upshot of this \ncomprehensive list of the \u201cincidents of employment\u201d is \nthat, if something is \u201cpart and parcel of the employment \nrelationship,\u201d the ADA shields it from discrimination. \nHishon, 467 U.S. at 75. \nb. The construction provision. Title I couples the \nreach of its \u201cgeneral rule\u201d with a flexible \u201c[c]onstruction\u201d \nprovision that explains what \u201c\u2018discriminate against a \n\n- 7 - \n \nqualified individual on the basis of disability [in the \ngeneral rule] includes.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b). That \nprovision makes clear that, like all anti-discrimination \nstatutes, Title I prohibits animus-based disparate \ntreatment. See, e.g., id. \u00a7 12112(b)(1). It also reaches \npolicies that have a disparate impact on people with \ndisabilities, specifically singling out \u201cstandards, criteria, \nor methods of administration that have the effect of \ndiscrimination on the basis of disability,\u201d id. \u00a7 \n12112(b)(3)(A), and \u201cstandards\u201d that \u201ctend to screen \nout \u2026 a class of individuals with disabilities,\u201d id. \u00a7 \n12112(b)(6). \nBut, unlike most other anti-discrimination statutes, \nthe ADA doesn\u2019t equate \u201cdiscriminate\u201d with an equal-\ntreatment mandate. Instead, it at times requires \n\u201cpreferential[]\u201d treatment to \u201cachieve [its] basic equal \nopportunity goal.\u201d US Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. \n391, 397 (2002). The \u201cconstruction\u201d provision accomplishes \nthis by defining \u201cdiscriminate\u201d to include the failure to \nprovide a \u201creasonable accommodation.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A). This affirmative mandate can demand \nsignificant changes: \u201cjob restructuring,\u201d \u201cmodified work \nschedules,\u201d \n\u201creassignment,\u201d \nthe \nmodification \nof \nequipment and \u201cfacilities\u201d to make them \u201creadily \naccessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities,\u201d \nand \u201cother similar accommodations.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12111(9). \nc. The \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition. While the \nsweep of the discrimination provision demonstrates the \nADA\u2019s \nplan \nto \naggressively \nroot \nout \ndisability \ndiscrimination in employment, Congress also sought to \nensure that Title I would not \u201cdemand action beyond the \nrealm of the reasonable.\u201d Barnett, 535 U.S. at 401. A \nnumber of its provisions thus balance the Act\u2019s ambitions \nagainst employers\u2019 legitimate interests: The Act requires \n\n- 8 - \n \nonly \u201creasonable\u201d accommodations and carves out \naccommodations that impose \u201cundue hardship\u201d on \nemployers, see, e.g., 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A), and it \nprovides a \u201cbusiness necessity\u201d defense against disparate-\nimpact discrimination stemming from \u201cstandards, tests, \nor selection criteria,\u201d id. \u00a7 12113(a). \nChief among these provisions is the general rule\u2019s \nprohibition \nof \ndiscrimination \nagainst \n\u201cqualified \nindividuals.\u201d A \u201cqualified individual\u201d is defined as \u201can \nindividual \nwho, \nwith \nor \nwithout \nreasonable \naccommodation, can perform the essential functions of the \nemployment position that such individual holds or \ndesires.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12111(8). The role of this definition\u2014and its \nplacement in the general rule\u2014is to \u201creaffirm\u201d that Title \nI \u201cdoes not undermine an employer\u2019s ability to choose and \nmaintain qualified workers.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 2, \nat 55 (1990). An employer, for instance, may refuse to hire \nsomeone whose disability prevents them (even with the \nbenefit of an accommodation) from \u201clift[ing] fifty pounds\u201d \nif doing so is necessary for performing the job. H.R. Rep. \nNo. 101-485, at 56. Title I thus allows employers cabined \nauthority to act on the basis of disability; they may do so \nonly to ensure that the people they hire can perform the \ncore, or \u201cessential,\u201d functions of the job at issue\u2014a limited \nrole that the definition of \u201cqualified individual\u201d \nunderscores by requiring deference to the \u201cemployer\u2019s \njudgment as to what functions of a job are essential,\u201d but \nnothing more. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8). \n2. Title I\u2019s enforcement provision. To vindicate its \nsubstantive prohibition on disability-based discrimination, \nTitle I adopted what was, by the time the ADA became \nlaw, a proven remedial mechanism. Section 12117, entitled \n\u201cEnforcement,\u201d provides that the \u201cpowers, remedies, and \nprocedures\u201d available under Title VII may be invoked by \n\n- 9 - \n \n\u201cany person alleging discrimination on the basis of \ndisability in violation of\u201d Title I. Id. \u00a7 12117(a). Even \nbefore the ADA was enacted, retirees had used those \nremedies and procedures to enforce their rights under \nTitle VII with respect to post-employment benefits. See, \ne.g., Florida v. Long, 487 U.S. 223, 225 (1988); Norris, 463 \nU.S. at 1074; City of Los Angeles, Dep\u2019t of Water & Power \nv. Manhart, 435 U.S. 702, 704 (1978).  \n3. The Fair Pay Act. Title VII\u2019s enforcement \nmechanism has since been expanded through the Lilly \nLedbetter Fair Pay Act. See Pub. L. No. 111-2, \u00a7 3, \n123 Stat. 5 (2009). That Act clarifies that an unlawful \nemployment practice \u201coccurs\u201d\u2014and thus restarts the \ntime to sue\u2014when:  \n(1) the \u201cdiscriminatory compensation decision or \nother practice is adopted,\u201d  \n(2) the person is \u201csubject to a discriminatory \ncompensation decision,\u201d or  \n(3) \u201cwhen an individual is affected by application of \na discriminatory compensation decision or other \npractice, including each time wages, benefits, or \nother compensation is paid.\u201d  \nId. \n\u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A). \nThis \nmeans \nthat \n\u201cevery \ndiscriminatory paycheck or other compensation resulting, \nin whole or in part, from an earlier discriminatory pay \ndecision or other practice\u201d is another occurrence for which \na person can seek redress. See H.R Rep. No. 110-237, at 3 \n(2007). \nB. \nFactual background \nIn 1999, after serving in the military, Karyn Stanley \nbegan her career as a firefighter for the City of Sanford, \nFlorida. Pet. App. 2a. In 2005, she was promoted to Fire \n\n- 10 - \n \nLieutenant. All told, Lt. Stanley served the City for almost \ntwo decades as a firefighter. Doc. 1 at 3.  \nWhen the City offered her the job, her employment \npackage included a \u201chealth insurance subsidy.\u201d Pet. App. \n3a. This benefit covered most of the cost of participating \nin the City\u2019s health-insurance plan. Id.; Doc. 1 at 5. So \nalthough Lt. Stanley\u2019s monthly health-insurance premium \nunder the City\u2019s health plan was approximately $1,300, the \nCity\u2019s subsidy covered $1,000 of that cost, requiring her to \npay only $300. The City told her that this benefit applied \nboth to current employees and to qualifying retirees until \nthey reached age sixty-five. Doc. 38-15 at 11. A retiree was \neligible regardless of whether she \u201cretire[d] with twenty-\nfive (25) years of service\u201d or \u201cretire[d] for disability \nreasons.\u201d Doc. 38-6 at 2; Pet. App. 21a.  \nThis health-insurance subsidy was an especially \nimportant benefit for firefighters like Lt. Stanley because \nthey have one of the \u201chighest rates of injuries and illnesses \nof all occupations.\u201d Bureau of Lab. Stats., Occupational \nOutlook Handbook, Firefighters, https://perma.cc/F8CP-\nUJL8. Indeed, for many critical public-service jobs that \ncome with lower salaries, post-employment benefits are a \nmajor draw for potential employees, representing an \nimportant part of the compensation for which they \nundertake (and stay in) their roles as police officers, \nfirefighters, or other first responders. See Bureau of Lab. \nStats., Employee Benefits, https://perma.cc/PLP6-7GHL. \nIn 2003, unbeknownst to Lt. Stanley, the City quietly \nchanged its subsidy policy to distinguish between \n\u201cdisabled\u201d and \u201cnormal\u201d retirees. Doc. 1 at 12. The new \npolicy changed the benefits eligibility for \u201call employees \nretiring as a result of full disability\u201d so that it would run \nonly \u201cuntil the disabled retiree receives Medicare benefits \n\n- 11 - \n \nor until 24 months have elapsed from the date of \nretirement, whichever comes first.\u201d Pet. App. 22a; Doc. \n38-11 at 4. By contrast, \u201cnormal retirees\u201d remained \neligible until age sixty-five. Doc. 39-16 at 13. So if a \nfirefighter is injured in the line of duty or develops a \ncareer-ending illness one year before she completes her \ntwenty-five years of service, the subsidy lasts for only \ntwenty-four months. \nThe City claimed that the new policy was a necessary \n\u201ccost cutting measure[].\u201d Doc. 38 at 7. But it never offered \nany justification for cutting costs associated with disabled \nemployees alone. The City\u2019s HR director had no \nexplanation, Doc. 39-4 at 10, 13\u201314, and it was unable to \nidentify any \u201cdata, mathematical calculations, [or] \ncorrespondence \u2026 upon which [it] based its decision\u201d to \nrescind benefits from disabled retirees and not \u201cnormal \nretirees.\u201d Doc. 39-16 at 5, 40. Indeed, city employees could \nnot even point to any \u201cfinancial estimates\u201d of \u201cthe cost of \ncontinuing the disability retirees[\u2019] [subsidy] longer than \n24 months\u201d before enacting the policy. Doc. 39-9 at 46. \nWhatever the reason for the change, the new policy \ndecimated Lt. Stanley\u2019s promised retirement benefits \nbecause her career as a firefighter was cut short by \nParkinson\u2019s disease. After nearly twenty years of service, \nLt. Stanley began to develop \u201cstiffness [and] rigidity \u2026 as \nwell as [a] loss of dexterity in her extremities.\u201d Doc. 38-4 \nat 3. In 2016, she was officially diagnosed with \nParkinson\u2019s. Pet. App. 2a. For a longtime firefighter like \nLt. Stanley, that diagnosis was tragic but not surprising. \nSome states have adopted a legal presumption that \nfirefighters who develop Parkinson\u2019s did so in the line of \nduty based on the frequency with which the disease afflicts \n\n- 12 - \n \nfirefighters. See N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law \u00a7 207-kkk (Consol.); \nInd. Code Ann. \u00a7 5-10-15-5.5.  \nFor two years after her diagnosis, Lt. Stanley \ncontinued to work as a lieutenant. Pet. App. 2a. But \neventually it became clear that Lt. Stanley\u2019s disability was \npreventing her from meeting the physical demands of her \njob. Pet. App. 2a. In 2018, at the age of forty-seven, Lt. \nStanley took disability retirement with the City\u2019s \nagreement. Pet. App. 2a. \nAt that point, Lt. Stanley expected the employer she \nhad served for almost twenty years to stand by the \nbargain that it had struck with her when she was hired. \nThe City had explained her original benefits package \nwhen she first joined, and it had never told her about any \nchange in policy. Doc. 38-15 at 9. She had never received \nan updated human resources manual explaining that she \nwould no longer receive the retirement benefits she was \nexpecting. Doc. 38-15 at 9, 11. But just twenty-four months \nafter she retired, the City discontinued Lt. Stanley\u2019s \nhealth-insurance \nsubsidy, \nleaving \nher \nfinancially \nresponsible for all of her health insurance. Pet. App. 3a.  \nFor the past few years, Lt. Stanley has paid out of \npocket for the entire cost of the City\u2019s health-insurance \npolicy, which she relies on for her Parkinson\u2019s treatment. \nDoc 39-9 at 23; Doc. 38-15 at 11, 21. The cost to Lt. Stanley \nof covering the $1,000 monthly subsidy until she is sixty-\nfive\u2014if she is even able to do so\u2014would be more than \n$150,000. Doc. 1 at 6\u20137. Due to the high cost of the City\u2019s \nhealth-insurance premium without the subsidy, no other \ndisabled retirees have been able to stay on the City\u2019s \ninsurance after the loss of the subsidy. Doc. 39-9 at 25; see \nDoc. 39-16 at 3\u20134. Non-disabled retirees, however, \n\n- 13 - \n \ntypically remain on the City\u2019s health insurance until they \nbecome eligible for Medicare. Doc. 39-4 at 69. \nC. Procedural background \nLt. Stanley filed this lawsuit alleging that the City\u2019s \npolicy violated the ADA. Pet. App. 24a. The district court \ndismissed Lt. Stanley\u2019s Title I claim. The court found itself \nbound by circuit precedent holding that a \u201cdisabled \nformer employee\u201d like Lt. Stanley has \u201cno standing to \nsue\u201d over post-employment benefits under Title I because \nshe is \u201cno longer\u201d a qualified individual. Pet. App. 24a. \nThe Eleventh Circuit affirmed. It held that Lt. \nStanley, as a former employee, could not sue about \ndiscrimination in her benefits under the ADA because she \nwas not a \u201cqualified individual\u201d at the time that the City \nterminated her subsidy payments in 2020. Pet. App. 11a\u2013\n12a. The court emphasized that section 12111(8) defines \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d using the \u201cpresent tense\u201d words \n\u201c[c]an,\u201d \u201cholds,\u201d and \u201cdesires.\u201d Pet. App. 11a. Thus, it \nheld, a plaintiff \u201cmust desire or already have a job with the \ndefendant at the time the defendant commits the \ndiscriminatory act.\u201d Id. And since Lt. Stanley was a \n\u201cretiree, not [an] employee,\u201d in 2020, she was not a \n\u201cqualified individual.\u201d Pet. App. 16a. \nThe panel further concluded that Lt. Stanley was not \na \u201cqualified individual\u201d at any other discrete moment in \nwhich discrimination could have occurred. Pet. App. 16a\u2013\n17a. The court announced that Lt. Stanley \u201cconcede[d]\u201d \nthat the City\u2019s change of the policy in 2003 could not \namount to actionable discrimination. Pet. App. 16a. And it \n\u201cagree[d]\u201d with Lt. Stanley\u2019s (alleged) concession that her \nclaim could not turn on the 2003 policy change because she \nwas \u201cnot yet disabled at that time.\u201d Id. Nor, the court \nreasoned, could Lt. Stanley\u2019s claim turn on the City\u2019s \n\n- 14 - \n \nactions in the period after she was diagnosed with \nParkinson\u2019s but before she retired because she (allegedly \nalso) \u201cconceded that \u2026 she was [not] impacted\u201d until after \nshe retired. Pet. App. 18a.  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI. The ADA permits former employees to sue over \npost-employment benefits.  \nThe who: The ADA\u2019s enforcement provision allows suit \nby \u201cany person alleging discrimination\u201d in violation of the \nAct who \u201cclaim[s] to be aggrieved.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12117(a), \n2000e-5(f)(1). This language doesn\u2019t limit suits to \n\u201cemployees,\u201d \u201capplicants,\u201d or \u201cqualified individuals.\u201d  \nThe what: The ADA targets discrimination not just in \nhiring \nand \nfiring \nbut \nalso \nin \n\u201cemployee \ncompensation \u2026 and \nother \nterms, \nconditions, \nand \nprivileges of employment.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12112(a). By the time the \nADA was enacted in 1990, this Court had already \ninterpreted Title VII\u2019s parallel language as protecting \nretirement benefits.  \nThe when: The Fair Pay Act further clarifies that \nretirees may bring suit under the ADA when they are \n\u201caffected by application of\u201d discriminatory benefits plans \n\u201cadopted\u201d while they were working. Id. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A). \nThis allows a plaintiff to challenge a decision to adopt a \ndiscriminatory benefits policy each time that she is \nadversely affected, even after her employment ends. So \neven if Ms. Stanley didn\u2019t feel the effects of the City\u2019s \npolicy until she retired, these provisions together make \nclear that her claim may proceed.  \nII. The court of appeals independently erred in holding \nthat the ADA protects only those who \u201chold[] or desire[]\u201d \na job. Nothing in the ADA\u2019s text requires that result, \n\n- 15 - \n \nwhich would leave retirees unprotected against even the \nmost egregious discrimination. \nThe ADA doesn\u2019t require a person to \u201chold[] or \ndesire[]\u201d a job to be a qualified individual. The definition \nasks if an individual \u201ccan perform the essential functions \nof the employment position that such individual holds or \ndesires.\u201d In other words, it tests if you can do a job, not if \nyou have or want one.  \nThis makes sense given the definition\u2019s role in the \nstatutory scheme: It affords employers necessary, but \ncircumscribed, flexibility to restrict employment on the \nbasis of disability to preserve the functioning of a \nbusiness. It allows employers to screen out people who \ncan\u2019t perform core job functions, not to implement \ndiscriminatory policies unrelated to job performance.  \nThis understanding avoids treating key statutory \nterms \nas \nsurplusage. \nThe \nADA\u2019s \nreasonable-\naccommodation provision applies to a \u201cqualified individual \nwith a disability who is an applicant or employee.\u201d Id. \n\u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A) (emphasis added). This tells us that the \nAct contemplates at least some qualified individuals who \nare neither applicants nor employees\u2014a category that \nwould not exist under the court of appeals\u2019 reading. \nCommon usage, grammar, and logic all show that the \ntext doesn\u2019t demand the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s reading. \nConsider this rule: \u201cAn individual may not watch the \nmovie unless the individual silences the electronic devices \nthat such individual carries.\u201d If you come to the theater \nwithout a device, can you stay? Of course. The rule \nrequires patrons to turn off their devices only to the extent \nthat they have them. The \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition \nworks the same way: It requires individuals to be able to \nperform essential job functions only to the extent they \nhold or desire jobs with such functions.  \n\n- 16 - \n \nEven granting that the \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition \ncould be read in a vacuum to support the Eleventh \nCircuit\u2019s view, ours is the better reading in the context of \nthe statute as a whole. Treating retirees as \u201cqualified \nindividuals\u201d allows the definition to fulfill its role in \nscreening out those who can\u2019t perform job functions, \nwithout turning it into an arbitrary license to discriminate. \nIt avoids rendering key language superfluous. It gives \nforce to the ADA\u2019s protections for retirement benefits. \nAnd it maintains congruity between the ADA and Title \nVII. In short, it is the reading that is far \u201cmore consistent \nwith the broader context of\u201d the Act and the \u201cprimary \npurpose\u201d of the definition. Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., \n519 U.S. 337, 346 (1997).  \nARGUMENT \n \nBy allowing employers to discriminate against \ndisabled retirees with impunity\u2014in ways that would never \nbe tolerated for race, religion, sex, or national origin\u2014the \nEleventh Circuit\u2019s decision frustrates Congress\u2019s plan for \na \u201ccomprehensive national mandate for the elimination of \ndiscrimination against individuals with disabilities.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(b)(1). The decision is flawed in two key \nrespects, each of which independently warrants reversal:  \n \nFirst, it fundamentally misunderstands the ADA\u2019s \ntext and structure. The ADA allows \u201cany person alleging \ndiscrimination\u201d to sue, including retirees who are later \n\u201caffected by the application of\u201d discriminatory policies \nthat were \u201cadopted\u201d while they were working. That \ndescription fits the allegations in this case to a T.  \n \nSecond, it misreads the ADA\u2019s \u201cqualified individual\u201d \ndefinition as excluding retirees from the Act\u2019s protection. \nThe text doesn\u2019t compel that reading, and an \u201cinquiry into \ntext and context\u201d makes the statute\u2019s contrary meaning \n\n- 17 - \n \nclear. Pulsifer v. United States, 601 U.S. 124, 141 (2024). \nReading the ADA to protect retirees makes sense of the \nscheme as a whole, harmonizes Title VII and the ADA, \navoids turning key provisions into surplusage, and escapes \nan outcome that puts the statute \u201cat war with itself.\u201d Groff \nv. DeJoy, 600 U.S. 447, 472 (2023). \nI. \nThe ADA permits former employees to bring suit \nwith respect to post-employment benefits. \nThe ADA permits retirees to sue over their benefits. \nThis conclusion follows from the ADA\u2019s enforcement \nprovision, its coverage of post-employment benefits, and \nthe Fair Pay Act\u2019s clarification of when plaintiffs may sue \nover benefits. Together they make clear that Lt. Stanley\u2019s \nsuit, which challenges a policy \u201cadopted\u201d while she was \nemployed, and to which she was \u201csubjected\u201d while \nworking for the City, may proceed. This Court therefore \nneed not even reach the court of appeals\u2019 erroneous \nholding that the Act only prohibits discrimination against \npeople who currently \u201chold[] or desire[]\u201d a job.  \nA. The who: The ADA\u2019s enforcement provision \nallows suit by \u201cany person alleging \ndiscrimination\u201d in violation of the Act. \nTo enforce the ADA\u2019s \u201cbroad mandate,\u201d Martin, \n532 U.S. at 674\u201375, section 12117, titled \u201cEnforcement,\u201d \nprovides \u201cto any person alleging discrimination on the \nbasis of disability in violation of\u201d Title I the full range of \nremedies provided for in Title VII. 42 U.S.C \u00a7 12117(a). \nNoticeably absent from this authority to sue is a \nrequirement that the plaintiff be a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d \nInstead, \u201cany person\u201d who alleges a discriminatory act in \nviolation of the statute can invoke Title VII\u2019s remedial \nframework. And that framework contains no relevant \nlimitation either: It allows any \u201cperson claiming to be \n\n- 18 - \n \naggrieved\u201d to bring a \u201ccivil action.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-\n5(f)(1).  \nDespite its breadth, Title VII\u2019s remedial provision \ndoes have its limits: Only plaintiffs who assert an \u201cinterest \narguably sought to be protected by the statute\u201d may \ninvoke these remedies. Thompson v. N. Am. Stainless, \nLP, 562 U.S. 170, 177\u201378 (2011). But this \u201czone-of-\ninterests\u201d test is \u201cnot meant to be especially demanding.\u201d \nMatch-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish \nBand \nof \nPottawatomi \nIndians v. Patchak, 567 U.S. 209, 224\u201325 (2012). It bars a \nplaintiff only if her asserted \u201cinterests are so marginally \nrelated to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the \nstatute that it cannot reasonably be assumed that \nCongress intended to permit the suit.\u201d Thompson, 562 \nU.S. at 178; see also, e.g., Bank of Am. Corp. v. City of \nMiami, 581 U.S. 189, 200 (2017) (holding that Miami could \nsue under the Fair Housing Act for financial injury \nincurred from discriminatory lending practices). Which is \nto say, this textual limitation cuts off only suits that are far \nafield from the statute\u2019s purposes\u2014for example, a \n\u201cshareholder\u201d suit against a corporation over its \u201cfiring \n[of] a valuable employee for racially discriminatory \nreasons.\u201d Thompson, 562 U.S. at 177. \nAssuming that the same zone-of-interest test applies, \nretirees in Lt. Stanley\u2019s shoes satisfy it. The ADA\u2019s \n\u201ccomprehensive\u201d mandate to \u201celiminat[e]\u201d discrimination, \n42 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 12101(b)(1), \naims \nnot \njust \nat \nthe \n\u201cpersist[ence]\u201d of discrimination in \u201cjobs,\u201d but also in the \ndistribution of \u201cbenefits,\u201d id. \u00a7 12101(a)(5). So there could \nbe no doubt that retirees\u2019 claims would fall within the Act\u2019s \nzone of interests. See Lexmark Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Static Control \nComponents, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 131 (2014) (explaining \nthat, when a statute contains a \u201cdetailed statement of [its] \n\n- 19 - \n \npurposes,\u201d no \u201cguesswork\u201d is required to determine the \nzone of interests). It\u2019s hard to imagine anyone better \nsituated to bring this claim\u2014over her benefits stemming \nfrom her job\u2014than Lt. Stanley. \nB. The what: The ADA protects against \ndiscrimination with respect to post-\nemployment benefits. \nThe ADA\u2019s substantive prohibitions\u2014the what\u2014also \nreach claims from retirees. The ADA specifically guards \nagainst discrimination in post-employment benefits. It \ntargets not just discrimination in hiring and firing but also \nforbids \u201cdiscriminat[ing] against a qualified individual on \nthe basis of disability in regard to \u2026 employee \ncompensation \u2026 and \nother \nterms, \nconditions, \nand \nprivileges of employment.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a). By the \ntime the ADA was enacted in 1990, this Court had already \nmade clear that Title VII\u2019s parallel language protected \npost-employment benefits. See, e.g., Hishon, 467 U.S. at \n77; Norris, 463 U.S. at 1081.   \nThat\u2019s because \u201c[a] benefit need not accrue before a \nperson\u2019s employment is completed\u201d to be protected. \nHishon, 467 U.S. at 77. What matters, instead, is that the \nbenefit is \u201cpart and parcel of the employment \nrelationship\u201d; if it is, it may not be \u201cdoled out in a \ndiscriminatory fashion.\u201d Id. at 75. That common-sense \nconclusion means that \u201c[t]here is no question\u201d that \n\u201cretirement benefits\u201d are protected. Norris, 463 U.S. at \n1079; see also Hishon, 467 U.S. at 77. In the twenty-five \nyears between Title VII\u2019s passage and the ADA\u2019s passage, \nthis Court repeatedly entertained Title VII claims about \npost-employment benefits. See Long, 487 U.S. at 225; \nNorris, 463 U.S. at 1074; Manhart, 435 U.S. at 705.  \n\n- 20 - \n \nWhen the ADA adopted Title VII\u2019s terminology, it \ncarried forward this settled meaning. \u201c[T]he enactment of \na new provision that mirrors the existing statutory text \nindicates \u2026 that the new provision has that same \nmeaning.\u201d Lightfoot v. Cendant Mortg. Corp., 580 U.S. 82, \n95 (2017). And the ADA\u2019s protection of post-employment \nbenefits is confirmed by other sections. For example, the \nADA prohibits employers from contracting with an \n\u201corganization providing fringe benefits\u201d in a way that \u201chas \nthe effect\u201d of discriminating on the basis of disability. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(2). \u201c[F]ringe benefits\u201d has a well-\naccepted meaning, and it encompasses post-employment \nbenefits. Howard Delivery Serv., Inc. v. Zurich Am. Ins. \nCo., 547 U.S. 651, 654 (2006); see also 135 Cong. Rec. \nS10712 (daily ed. Sept. 7, 1989) (statement of Sen. Harkin) \n(describing the hope that covered individuals would \u201clive \n[their] retirement years in dignity\u201d); Oversight Hearing \non H.R. 4498 before a Subcomm. of H. Comm. Educ. & \nLabor, 100th Cong. 2d Sess. 54 (1988) (describing the \nADA\u2019s focus on protecting disabled Americans\u2019 \u201cbenefits \nfor \u2026 health and retirement\u201d). \nAdd that all together, and it is clear that a retiree in \nLt. Stanley\u2019s position has a right to sue. Whether or not \nsuch a retiree is a \u201cqualified individual\u201d when they \nexperience the effects of the discrimination, they are a \ndisabled employee claiming that their employer applied a \ndiscriminatory policy (which the ADA prohibits) to strip \nthem of their benefits (which the ADA protects).  \nIn fact, a benefits policy that facially discriminates \nagainst people with disabilities\u2014everyone in the company \nreceives a pension, except for people with disabilities\u2014\nnecessarily runs afoul of the ADA. It obviously \n\u201cdiscriminate[s] \u2026 on the basis of disability.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\n- 21 - \n \n\u00a7 12112(a). And it does so with regard to \u201ccompensation,\u201d \nid., which is paid to people in exchange for their \n\u201cperform[ance of] the essential functions\u201d of an \n\u201cemployment position,\u201d id. \u00a7 12111(8).  \nIn other words, in understanding what the statute \nprotects, the \u201cqualified individual\u201d language is largely \nbeside the point in a case of this kind. As a general \nproposition, employers only pay \u201ccompensation\u201d to \n\u201cqualified individuals\u201d who \u201ccan perform the essential \nfunctions of the employment position that\u201d they \u201chold[] or \ndesire[].\u201d Id. And we know from preexisting usage that \nsuch \u201ccompensation\u201d includes benefits employees receive \nafter retirement. So when employers discriminate \u201cin \nregard to \u2026 compensation,\u201d they necessarily do so \n\u201cagainst a qualified individual.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12112(a). And as the \nnext section explains, it is proper for an employee (or \nformer employee) to sue whenever such a discriminatory \ncompensation policy affects them\u2014including when they \nreceive their benefits only after retiring. \nC. The when: The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act \nand Title I\u2019s enforcement provision taken \ntogether mean that retirees can sue over post-\nemployment benefits. \nIt is clear, then, that retirees are among the \u201cany \nperson[s]\u201d \u201cclaiming to be aggrieved\u201d who can invoke \nTitle I\u2019s enforcement mechanism. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5. So \ntoo is it clear that their retirement benefits are \n\u201ccompensation\u201d protected by the Act. Id. \u00a7 12112(a). The \nLilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, which Title I \nincorporates, brings Lt. Stanley\u2019s claim across the finish \nline: It allows retirees to bring suit when they are \n\u201caffected by application of\u201d discriminatory benefits plans \n\u201cadopted\u201d while they were working. Id. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A).  \n\n- 22 - \n \n1. Before the Fair Pay Act, those seeking to challenge \ndiscriminatory \npolicies \naffecting \npost-employment \nbenefits faced a challenge: Like Lt. Stanley, they may not \nhave learned about their discriminatory benefits policies \nuntil they were affected after retiring. That could be years \nafter the policies were adopted. Because such a claim \ncould have been characterized as merely seeking redress \nfor the \u201cadverse effects resulting from the past \ndiscrimination,\u201d it could well have been barred by the \nstatute of limitations. Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & \nRubber Co., 550 U.S. 618, 628 (2007). \nThe Fair Pay Act resolved this dilemma. It provides \nthat an unlawful employment practice occurs with respect \nto discrimination in compensation: \n[1] when a discriminatory compensation decision \nor other practice is adopted, [2] when an individual \nbecomes subject to a discriminatory compensation \ndecision or other practice, or [3] when an \nindividual is affected by application of a \ndiscriminatory compensation decision or other \npractice, including each time wages, benefits, or \nother compensation is paid, resulting in whole or \nin part from such a decision or other practice. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A). This provision applies to the \nADA through its incorporation of Title VII\u2019s enforcement \nmechanisms. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12117(a). \nThe Fair Pay Act thus makes clear that a claim under \nthe ADA is timely if the plaintiff sues when she \u201cbecomes \nsubject to\u201d or \u201cis affected by\u201d discrimination that occurred \nduring her tenure. This is true even if the plaintiff doesn\u2019t \nreceive the benefit in question until after her employment \nhas concluded. As a result, the Act permits a plaintiff to \nchallenge an employer\u2019s earlier decision to adopt a \n\n- 23 - \n \ndiscriminatory benefits policy when she is adversely \naffected, either by receiving a reduced benefit or by being \ndenied the benefit entirely. \nCrucially, the Fair Pay Act allows a plaintiff\u2019s claim to \naccrue or re-accrue even after the plaintiff\u2019s employment \nhas concluded. As long as the plaintiff \u201cbecomes subject \nto\u201d or \u201cis affected by application of\u201d the employer\u2019s earlier \ndiscriminatory decision after leaving her job, the \nemployer\u2019s liability will accrue or re-accrue then. 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A), (B). The Eleventh Circuit\u2019s view \nthat a former employee is no longer a \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d because she neither \u201cholds\u201d nor \u201cdesires\u201d a job \nhas no bearing on this analysis. 42 U.S.C. 12111(8). The \nFair Pay Act doesn\u2019t treat each discrete payment (or \nnonpayment) as a new discriminatory act that must \nindependently satisfy all of the ADA\u2019s elements. Rather, \nit allows a claim to accrue based on the past discriminatory \ndecision when the plaintiff is affected by that decision. \nThe Fair Pay Act eliminates any doubt about a \npotential mismatch between Congress\u2019s intent to broadly \nprohibit disability-based discrimination in retirement \nbenefits and the ADA\u2019s text. It ensures that plaintiffs can \ntimely enforce the settled rule that \u201cclassification of \nemployees on the basis of [disability] is no more \npermissible at the pay-out stage of a retirement plan than \nat the pay-in stage.\u201d Norris, 463 U.S. at 1081. And it \nreinforces what the ADA\u2019s text, structure, and purpose \nalready make clear: Former employees are protected \nfrom discrimination as to post-employment benefits.  \n2. When Lt. Stanley began her career as a firefighter, \nthe City promised to continue paying her health-insurance \nsubsidy until the age of 65 so long as she \u201cretire[d] with \ntwenty-five (25) years of service\u201d or \u201cretire[d] for \n\n- 24 - \n \ndisability reasons.\u201d Doc. 38-6 at 2; Pet. App. 21a. That \nretirement subsidy was, without a doubt, part of her \n\u201ccompensation\u201d and thus protected by Title I. 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 12112; see supra 19\u201321. Four years later, and while Lt. \nStanley was still working as a firefighter, the City changed \nits policy to distinguish between \u201cdisabled\u201d and \u201cnormal\u201d \nretirees. Doc. 1 at 12; see also Doc. 39-16 at 27\u201328. The \nlatter were still eligible for the full retirement benefit, but \nthe former would now receive only two years of the health \ncare subsidy (or less, if they qualified for Medicare \nbenefits). Pet. App. 22a. \nLt. Stanley was, of course, employed by the City in \n2003 when this \u201cdiscriminatory compensation decision\u201d \nthat she challenges was \u201cadopted.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-\n5(e)(3)(A). Thus, even if Lt. Stanley did need to hold or \ndesire a job when the City discriminated against her (but \nsee infra Part II), she did. The City \u201cadopted,\u201d id., its \npolicy in 2003 when Lt. Stanley indisputably was a \nqualified individual, and that policy discriminated \u201con the \nbasis of disability in regard to \u2026 employee compensation\u201d \n(her benefits), id. \u00a7 12112(a). Lt. Stanley\u2019s claim then re-\naccrued in 2020 when she was \u201caffected by application of\u201d \nthe policy (she was denied the health care subsidy). Id. \n\u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A). That means that she could bring this \nlawsuit exactly when she did to challenge exactly what she \nchallenged.   \nThe Eleventh Circuit rejected this reasoning by \nannouncing that Lt. Stanley \u201cconcedes, and we agree, that \nher claim cannot turn on the 2003 amendment to the \nbenefits plan because she was not yet disabled at that \ntime.\u201d App. 16. Nothing supports the assertion that Lt. \nStanley made that concession. To the contrary, Lt. \nStanley repeatedly argued the opposite, insisting that the \n\n- 25 - \n \nadoption \nof \nthe \npolicy \ndid \nconstitute \nunlawful \ndiscrimination against her. See, e.g., Doc. 1 at 4 \n(allegations in complaint addressing 2003 change); Op. Br. \nat viii\u2013ix (expressly adopting similar argument made in \nthe United States\u2019 amicus brief); Reply Br. at 6 (\u201cIn this \ncase, \nthe \nCity\u2019s \ndecision \nto \nenact \nthe \nfacially \ndiscriminatory 24-Month Rule in 2003 is the initial \n\u2018challenged employment decision.\u2019 \u2026 Thus, [Lt.] Stanley \nwas a \u2018Qualified Individual\u2019 able to perform her firefighter \nduties at the time of the \u2018challenged employment \ndecision.\u2019\u201d) (emphasis omitted); Oral Arg. 4:59\u20135:05 (\u201cAt \nthe time of the discriminatory act in 2003 she was a \nqualified individual.\u201d).  \nTo the extent the Eleventh Circuit held that the 2003 \npolicy change could not be actionable discrimination \nbecause Lt. Stanley \u201cwas not yet disabled at that time,\u201d it \nmisapplied the statute. App. 16. A person need not be \ndisabled to be subjected to unlawful discrimination under \nTitle I. The statute was specifically amended to avoid that \noutcome: It broadly prohibits discrimination \u201con the basis \nof disability\u201d rather than, as it had previously provided, \nonly against a qualified individual \u201cwith a disability.\u201d \nCompare 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a), with Pub. L. No. 101-336, \nTitle I, \u00a7 102, 104 Stat. 331 (1990). Here, the City acted \u201con \nthe basis of disability\u201d when it adopted a policy that, on its \nface, limits the amount of time that a person receives a \nsubsidy based on whether that person has a disability. See \nUAW v. Johnson Controls, Inc., 499 U.S. 187, 200 (1991) \n(\u201c[A]n explicit gender-based policy is sex discrimination \nunder\u201d Title VII).  \nIt is of no matter, then, that Lt. Stanley was not yet \ndisabled when the City changed its policy. Even if that was \n(somehow) relevant, it was inevitable that the facially \n\n- 26 - \n \ndiscriminatory policy would harm employees when they \nbecame disabled and had to retire before twenty-five \nyears of service. The Court may thus conceive of this claim \nas encompassing two moments of time that complete the \nwhole: when the facially discriminatory policy was \nadopted in 2003, and when Lt. Stanley became disabled. \nThis Court has recognized that certain Title VII claims \ncan encompass events occurring at different points in time \nas the basis for an action challenging a \u201csingle \ndiscriminatory act.\u201d Green v. Brennan, 578 U.S. 547, 562 \nn.7 (2016). By analogy, the same holds true here.  \nThe Fair Pay Act also demonstrates that the City \ndiscriminated against Lt. Stanley again when that same \ndiscriminatory policy was applied to her as she neared her \ninevitable early retirement. At that point, although she did \nnot yet feel the effects of the policy, Lt. Stanley became \n\u201csubject to\u201d it, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A); the policy \nconclusively determined what benefits she would receive \nonce her fast-approaching forced retirement began and, in \nthat way, removed her access to the more expansive \nbenefits package available to people without disabilities. \nSee Castellano v. City of New York, 142 F.3d 58, 68 (2d \nCir. 1998) (\u201c[A]n employee\u2019s entitlement to post-\nemployment fringe benefits arises \u2026 during his period of \nemployment.\u201d). That too is an \u201cunlawful employment \npractice\u201d \nthat \n\u201coccur[ed]\u201d \nduring \nLt. \nStanley\u2019s \nemployment. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A).1  \n \n1 The third way in which an unlawful employment practice \noccurs\u2014the individual becoming \u201caffected\u201d by the discriminatory \ndecision\u2014remains relevant here because it removes any doubt that \nLt. Stanley\u2019s claim is timely. She was \u201caffected\u201d when her subsidy \nended.  \n\n- 27 - \n \nThe Eleventh Circuit declined to address that alleged \ndiscrimination too, because Lt. Stanley \u201caffirmatively \nconceded\u201d that she was not \u201cimpacted by [the City\u2019s \npolicy] during her employment.\u201d App. 18. But that Lt. \nStanley was not yet \u201cimpacted\u201d (in terms of receiving a \ndecreased health care subsidy) in no way undermines her \nclaim. That\u2019s what the Fair Pay Act makes clear: A person \ncan be discriminated against when a \u201cdecision\u201d or \n\u201cpractice\u201d is \u201cadopted,\u201d or when they \u201cbecome[] subject \nto\u201d it, even if they are not \u201caffected by\u201d it until later. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A).  \nII. The ADA does not require a person to \u201chold[] or \ndesire[]\u201d a job to be a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d  \nThe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s holding was wrong for \nanother, independent reason: One does not need to \ncurrently \u201chold[] or desire\u201d a job to be a \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d under the ADA. The court below reached its \nholding by focusing on the definition of discrimination in \nsection 12112(a) and of \u201cqualified individual\u201d in section \n12111(8). Based on those provisions, it held that it is legal \nfor employers to discriminate against former employees \non the basis of disability.  \nNothing in the statute\u2019s text demands that surprising \nresult. The Eleventh Circuit\u2019s error is explained by its \nmisunderstanding \nof \nthe \ndefinition \nof \n\u201cqualified \nindividual.\u201d In the court\u2019s view, because section 12112(a) \nprohibits discrimination against \u201cqualified individuals\u201d \nand the definition of \u201cqualified individual\u201d speaks in the \npresent tense\u2014referring to a person who \u201ccan perform\u201d a \njob that the person \u201cholds\u201d or \u201cdesires\u201d\u2014the ADA \nprohibits discrimination only against a person while they \nhold (or are applying to) a job. App. 11.  \n\n- 28 - \n \nBut the court of appeals effectively rewrote the \nstatutory definition to impose two distinct requirements: \n\u201cQualified individual means an individual who (a) holds or \ndesires an employment position and (b) can perform the \nessential functions of that employment position.\u201d The text \nonly imposes one requirement: \u201c[Q]ualified individual \nmeans an individual who \u2026 can perform the essential \nfunctions of the employment position that such individual \nholds or desires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. 12111(8). The text asks only \none question\u2014what \u201ccan\u201d you do? \nThis understanding of the definition\u2019s text makes \nperfect sense given its role in the statute: It operates to \nafford employers cabined authority to act on the basis of \ndisability when doing so is necessary to preserve the \nfunctioning of the business. That is why the term is \ndefined with reference to \u201cessential functions,\u201d not \u201cany \nfunction.\u201d Its text is best read to impose only a conditional \nmandate, which tracks that role. If a person has (or seeks) \na job, that person must be able to perform its essential \nfunctions; if no such job exists\u2014because the person is \nretired\u2014the definition does not operate as a limit on the \nADA\u2019s prohibition on discrimination. In other words, the \ndefinition asks if you \u201ccan\u201d perform the functions of a job \nthat you hold or desire, not if you have or want one.  \nA. The text of section 12111(8) and its place in \nthe statutory scheme confirm that the \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition tests if you \ncan do a job, not if you have one.   \nThe definition of \u201cqualified individual\u201d exists to give \nemployers the cabined ability to act on the basis of job-\nrelated concerns so that they are not forced to hire or \nretain people who are incapable, even with the benefit of \nreasonable accommodations, of performing essential \n\n- 29 - \n \ntasks. We know that is the definition\u2019s role because of its \nplain text, its place in the statutory scheme, and its \nrelationship to other sections of the statute.  \n1. Text and purpose. \u201cStart with the text.\u201d Arellano v. \nMcDonough, 598 U.S. 1, 8 (2023). The definition asks if an \nindividual \u201ccan perform the essential functions of the \nemployment position that such individual holds or \ndesires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8) (emphasis added). It does \nnot ask if an individual \u201cholds or desires an employment \nposition whose essential functions she can perform.\u201d The \nlatter formulation would impose the \u201cmust hold or desire \na job\u201d requirement that the Eleventh Circuit perceived. \nThe former asks if you \u201ccan\u201d do a thing, not if you are \ndoing that thing or would do it.  \nThat the definition asks what an individual \u201ccan\u201d do \nmakes sense given its role in the statutory scheme. The \ndefinition gives employers necessary, but circumscribed, \nflexibility in light of the Act\u2019s sweeping impact. Title I \nprovides protection in all aspects of the employment \nrelationship. It broadly prohibits \u201cdiscriminat[ion]\u201d in \n\u201cjob application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or \ndischarge of employees, employee compensation, job \ntraining, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of \nemployment.\u201d \n42 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 12112(a). \nThat \ncovers \neverything from job applications to post-employment \nbenefits\u2014if something is \u201cpart and parcel of the \nemployment \nrelationship,\u201d \nan \nemployer \ncannot \n\u201cdiscriminate.\u201d Hishon, 467 U.S. at 75; supra at 19\u201321.  \nTitle I prohibits both \u201cdisparate treatment\u201d and \n\u201cdisparate impact.\u201d Raytheon Co. v. Hernandez, 540 U.S. \n44, 52 (2003). But it also goes further, \u201crequir[ing] \naffirmative \nconduct\u201d \nto \nensure \n\u201cthose \nwith \ndisabilities \u2026 obtain the same workplace opportunities \n\n- 30 - \n \nthat those without disabilities [] enjoy.\u201d Barnett, 535 U.S. \nat 397, 401; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A). Accordingly, the \nAct at times requires employers not to treat people with \ndisabilities \nequally, \nbut \ninstead \nto \ntreat \nthem \n\u201cpreferentially.\u201d \nBarnett, \n535 U.S. \nat \n397. \nThat \naffirmative mandate is reflected in the Act\u2019s definition of \ndiscrimination, which \u201cincludes \u2026 not making reasonable \naccommodations to the known physical or mental \nlimitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a \ndisability who is an applicant or employee.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A).  \nBecause of the Act\u2019s \u201cbold ambitions\u201d and \u201cfar-\nreaching\u201d scope, though, Congress recognized the need \nfor delineated \u201climits.\u201d Kincaid v. Williams, 143 S. Ct. \n2414, 2415\u201316 (2023) (Alito, J., dissenting from the denial \nof certiorari). As this Court has held, the ADA achieves its \nimportant \u201cobjectives\u201d within \u201cthe realm of the \nreasonable.\u201d Barnett, 535 U.S. at 401. Without some \nqualification, the statute would prevent employers from \ndenying employment to people whose disabilities, no \nmatter the steps taken to accommodate them, prevent \nthem from performing their jobs. A swimming pool could \nface liability for refusing to hire as a lifeguard a person \nwhose disability left her unable to swim. Congress, \nunsurprisingly, did not want to prohibit that sort of \nrational, and necessary, decision-making.  \nThe \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition ensures that \nemployers have the necessary leeway. The only people \nwho employers must hire, retain, and accommodate are \nthose who, \u201cwith or without\u201d accommodations, \u201ccan \nperform the essential functions of the employment \nposition.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8). The definition, then, exists \nto allow employers to screen out people who can\u2019t perform \n\n- 31 - \n \nthe core, or \u201cessential,\u201d functions of the job at issue. What \nit does not do, however, is grant employers a license to \nimplement \ndiscriminatory \nemployment \npolicies \nor \nindividual employment actions that have nothing to do \nwith an individual\u2019s ability to do a relevant job.  \n2. Statutory scheme. This understanding of the \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition\u2014as a screen that \nprevents employers from being obligated to hire and \naccommodate those who can\u2019t perform a job\u2014neatly \naligns with the rest of the statutory scheme that Congress \ndevised. Several provisions of the Act allow employers to \ntake actions that are justified in relation to the operation \nof their business. None of them invite employers to take \ndiscriminatory actions that have nothing to do with \nlegitimate business needs.  \nFor example, even when employers must provide \naccommodations, they need only be \u201creasonable,\u201d and \neven those they can forego if they \u201ccan demonstrate that \nthe accommodation would impose an undue hardship\u201d on \ntheir \u201coperation.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A). \u201c[Q]ualification \nstandards\u201d that screen out people with disabilities are \nimpermissible, unless that standard \u201cis shown to be job-\nrelated for the position in question and is consistent with \nbusiness necessity.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12112(b)(6). Other examples are \nsprinkled across the statute. See, e.g., id. \u00a7 12112(b)(7) \n(making it unlawful to administer \u201ctests concerning \nemployment\u201d unless those tests measure a person\u2019s \naptitude and skills rather than merely reflecting any \nimpairments); \nid. \n\u00a7 \n12112(d)(2) \n(prohibiting \npre-\nemployment \nmedical \nexaminations \nbut \npermitting \n\u201cinquiries into the ability of an applicant to perform job-\nrelated functions\u201d).  \n\n- 32 - \n \nEach of these provisions reflects a balance struck in \nthe Act: Discrimination is prohibited\u2014from application \nthrough retirement\u2014but employers have leeway to act on \nthe basis of disability where a sufficiently weighty and \nlegitimate business need calls for it. The \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d definition does just that\u2014nothing more, \nnothing less. It is not concerned with whether you have a \njob; it is concerned with employers\u2019 needs in relation to \ntheir current and future employees. Reading it to allow \ndiscrimination against former employees, by contrast \nmakes it do work in the statute that it simply is not doing. \n3. Surplusage. The court of appeals\u2019 reading also turns \nkey provisions of the Act into surplusage. It is a \u201c\u2018cardinal \nprincipal\u2019 of interpretation that courts must give effect, if \npossible, to every clause and word of a statute.\u201d Parker \nDrilling Mgmt. Servs., Ltd. v. Newton, 587 U.S. 601, 602 \n(2019). Accordingly, the canon against surplusage \ninstructs that a statute should be construed \u201cso that no \npart will be inoperative or superfluous, void or \ninsignificant.\u201d Rubin v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 583 U.S. \n202, 213 (2018). \nThe ADA\u2019s definition of discrimination, section \n12112(b)(5)(A), states that discrimination \u201cincludes \u2026 not \nmaking reasonable accommodations to the known physical \nor mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual \nwith a disability who is an applicant or employee.\u201d 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A) (emphasis added).  \nThis language tells us that the Act contemplates the \nexistence of some qualified individuals who are neither \n\u201capplicant[s] [n]or employee[s].\u201d If the court of appeals \nwas right that the qualified individual definition already \nscreens out individuals who do not \u201chold[] or desire[]\u201d a \njob, then this modifier\u2014\u201cwho is an applicant or employee\u201d \n\n- 33 - \n \n\u2014would be surplusage. And an interpretation that \n\u201ctreat[s]\u201d those \u201cstatutory terms as surplusage,\u201d \nparticularly when they\u2019re found in such a \u201cpivotal [] place \nin the statutory scheme\u201d (the reasonable-accommodation \nprovision), should give us pause. Duncan v. Walker, \n533 U.S. 167, 174 (2001). \u201cThe canon against surplusage is \nstrongest \nwhen \nan \ninterpretation \nwould \nrender \nsuperfluous another part of the same statutory scheme.\u201d \nCity of Chicago v. Fulton, 592 U.S. 154, 159 (2021).   \nThat there are \u201cqualified individual[s]\u201d not covered by \nsection 12112\u2019s reasonable-accommodation mandate is \nconfirmed by the other way its reach is narrowed. \nEmployers need only make reasonable accommodations \nfor \u201cqualified individual[s] with a disability.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A) (emphasis added). To be a \u201cqualified \nindividual,\u201d though, you need not have a disability. The \nADA was specifically amended to extend the \u201cgeneral\u201d \nantidiscrimination mandate not only to discrimination \nagainst persons \u201cwith a disability,\u201d but to more broadly \nreach discrimination \u201con the basis of disability.\u201d Compare \nPub. L. No. 101-336, Title I, \u00a7 102, 104 Stat. 331 (1990), \nwith 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a). Because there are \u201cqualified \nindividual[s]\u201d who are not disabled, as well as those who \nno longer hold or desire a job, then, the reasonable-\naccommodation provision makes perfect sense. That \nsection recognizes the breadth of who can be a \u201cqualified \nindividual,\u201d and then subtracts from its mandate the need \nto accommodate any \u201cqualified individual\u201d who is not a \nperson \u201cwith a disability\u201d and who is not \u201can applicant or \nemployee,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A)\u2014because only \ndisabled individuals engaged in (or seeking) active \nemployment actually need \u201caccommodations.\u201d   \n\n- 34 - \n \nSection 12112 thus demonstrates that, when Congress \nintended to limit the reach of a substantive protection to \napplicants and employees, it did so explicitly. \nB. Common usage, grammar, and logic all \ndemonstrate that the text does not compel \nreading \u201cqualified individual\u201d to exclude \nretirees. \nNothing in the text of the definition of \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d demands reading it to require that an \nindividual currently hold or desire a job. The Eleventh \nCircuit concluded otherwise, reasoning that, because of \nthe definition, the \u201cplain language\u201d of the anti-\ndiscrimination rule \u201cexpressly applie[s] only to \u2018qualified \nindividuals with a disability\u2019 who \u2018hold[]\u2019 or \u2018desire[]\u2019 an \n\u2018employment position.\u2019\u201d App. 7. But that reading seemed \nplain only because the court of appeals misunderstood a \nkey part of the definition: \nThe \nterm \n\u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d \nmeans \nan \nindividual who, with or without reasonable \naccommodation, \ncan \nperform \nthe \nessential \nfunctions of the employment position that such \nindividual holds or desires. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8) (emphasis added). It is the \u201ccan \nperform\u201d clause that makes the definition carry out its \nimportant role in the statute. See supra 29\u201331. That\u2019s how \nit tests an employee\u2019s capabilities. And retirees are not \nunable to pass this test\u2014that is, they\u2019re not unable to \nperform the essential functions of a job that they hold or \ndesire. \nTo be sure, testing the job capabilities of someone who \nis no longer working may seem logically awkward. But \nthat doesn\u2019t mean that retirees fail the test; it instead \n\n- 35 - \n \nhighlights the conditional nature of the requirement. And, \nas we explain below, common sense, common usage, and \nlogic all suggest that the best reading (or at least an \nequally plausible one) is that retirees are \u201cqualified \nindividuals.\u201d But even if one thought that the test was \nambiguous when applied to retirees, that still would \nrequire rejecting the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s reading, which is \n\u201c[in]consistent with the broader context\u201d of Title I \u201cand \nthe primary purpose of\u201d the \u201cqualified individual\u201d \ndefinition. Robinson, 519 U.S. at 849; see id. (holding that \n\u201cthe term \u2018employees,\u2019 as used in \u00a7 704(a) of Title VII\u201d \ncovers \u201cformer employees\u201d despite the text being \n\u201cambiguous\u201d because that reading is \u201cmore consistent \nwith the broader context of Title VII and the primary \npurpose of \u00a7 704(a)\u201d). \n1. Common usage. Title I defines a \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d as \u201can individual who, with or without \nreasonable accommodation, can perform the essential \nfunctions of the employment position that such individual \nholds or desires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8). The Eleventh \nCircuit mistakenly read that definition to require that an \nindividual currently hold or desire a job. But that is not \nthe only (or best) way to read the definition. A few parallel \nexamples demonstrate how an ordinary reader interprets \na sentence like this one.  \n\u201cYou can\u2019t watch the movie unless you silence your cell \nphone.\u201d If you come to the theater without a phone, do you \nviolate this rule? Surely no. That\u2019s because this rule \nrequires that patrons turn off their phones only to the \nextent that they have phones to turn off. For the same \nreason, a person without a phone can attend court despite \na rule that says \u201c[y]ou must turn off your cell phone before \n\n- 36 - \n \nentering the courtroom.\u201d2 The rules\u2014and their respective \npurposes\u2014are satisfied. \u201c[C]ommon sense,\u201d Pereira v. \nSessions, 585 U.S. 198, 211 (2018), tells us how to read \nthese rules. See Bond v. United States, 572 U.S. 844, 857 \n(2014) (\u201cThe notion that some things \u2018go without saying\u2019 \napplies to legislation just as it does to everyday life.\u201d). \nConsider another example. NASA gives an award each \nyear to the \u201camateur astronomer\u201d who \u201cdiscovered the \nintrinsically brightest near-Earth asteroid\u201d in the \nprevious year. 51 U.S.C. \u00a7 30902(c)(3)(A). As defined by \nthe statute, \u201camateur astronomer means an individual \nwhose employer does not provide any funding, payment, \nor compensation to the individual for the observation of \nasteroids and other celestial bodies.\u201d Id. \u00a7 30902(b)(1). Is \nan unemployed person with a home telescope eligible to \nwin that prize? Of course. What this rule obviously means \nin context is that, if you have an employer and if that \nemployer pays for your stargazing, you can\u2019t be an \n\u201camateur astronomer.\u201d Unemployed people don\u2019t fail that \ntest; they easily pass it.  \nOr try this one: \u201cA passenger may not board an \naircraft unless it is determined that the passenger is a \n\u2018cleared individual.\u2019\u201d \u201cA \u2018cleared individual\u2019 means an \nindividual who can successfully complete an x-ray \nscreening of the baggage that such individual carries or \nchecks.\u201d Does this hypothetical rule prohibit passengers \nwith no bags from boarding a plane? Obviously not. This \nrule doesn\u2019t require that a passenger have a carry-on or \nchecked bag; it requires the screening of any bag to the \nextent that a passenger has such luggage.  \n \n2 Thomas F. Eagleton U.S. Courthouse Self-Guided Tour, \nhttps://perma.cc/2BVB-2K4P. \n\n- 37 - \n \nIndeed, an actual TSA regulation provides that \u201c[n]o \nindividual may \u2026 board an aircraft without submitting to \nthe screening and inspection of\u201d her \u201caccessible \nproperty[.]\u201d 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1540.107(a). This regulation \nobviously doesn\u2019t require that a passenger carry any \n\u201caccessible property,\u201d only that she submit to the \nscreening of that property to the extent she has any.  \nAnother federal statute requires the government to \npay individuals for the \u201ccost of a comparable replacement \ndwelling\u201d when a federal project displaces them. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4623(a)(1)(A). Whether something qualifies as \na \n\u201ccomparable \nreplacement \ndwelling\u201d \nrequires \nconsidering how far away it is from the displaced person\u2019s \noriginal home \u201cwith respect to public utilities, facilities, \nservices, and \nthe \ndisplaced \nperson\u2019s \nplace \nof \nemployment.\u201d Id. \u00a7 4601(10) (emphasis added). The lack \nof a \u201cplace of employment\u201d can\u2019t possibly bar retirees \nfrom financial support.  \nNotably, Title II of the ADA has a similar textual \nfeature. That section forbids discrimination in public \n\u201cservices, programs, or activities.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132. Like \nTitle I, it makes use of \u201cqualified individual\u201d language: \n\u201c[N]o qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason \nof such disability, be excluded from participation in or be \ndenied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities \nof a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any \nsuch entity.\u201d Id. And its definition of \u201cqualified individual\u201d \nhas a similar structure to Title I\u2019s: \u201c[Q]ualified individual \nwith a disability means an individual with a disability who, \nwith or without reasonable modifications to rules, policies, \nor \npractices \u2026 meets \nthe \nessential \neligibility \nrequirements for the receipt of services or the \n\n- 38 - \n \nparticipation in programs or activities provided by a public \nentity.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12131(2) (emphasis added). \nNow consider a \u201crecreational\u201d program covered by the \nAct, United States v. Georgia, 546 U.S. 151, 157 (2006) \n(discussing \ndefinition \nof \n\u201cservices, \nprograms, \nor \nactivities\u201d), like the Washington & Old Dominion trail, \nwhich has no \u201cessential eligibility requirements\u201d for \n\u201cparticipation,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12131(2). The trail is open to \neveryone free of charge. Except that it has one rule: \u201cNo \npeople in wheelchairs.\u201d That blatant exclusion certainly \nviolates Title II. The fact that the trail has no \u201cessential \neligibility requirements\u201d does not mean the excluded \nperson with a disability ceases to be a \u201cqualified \nindividual.\u201d Instead, Title II is naturally read to say that, \nto \nthe \nextent \nthere \nare \n\u201cessential \neligibility \nrequirements,\u201d an individual must meet them. \nAlthough rules written this way can sometimes read \nawkwardly when their implicit condition fails, courts \nroutinely figure out how to interpret them. Take the \nfederal \ncompassionate-release \nstatute. \nThat \nlaw \nauthorizes a court to \u201cmodify a term of imprisonment\u201d \nwhen, among other things, the \u201creduction is consistent \nwith applicable policy statements issued by the \nSentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(A). In \nthe period after Congress passed the First Step Act, but \nbefore the Sentencing Commission revised its policy \nstatement, \nthe \n\u201coverwhelming \nmajority \nof \ncircuits \u2026 agreed that\u201d the only potentially relevant \npolicy statement was not \u201capplicable.\u201d 3 Charles Alan \nWright & Arthur R. Miller, Fed. Prac. & Proc. Crim. \n\u00a7 638.2 (5th ed. 2024). But courts didn\u2019t get hung up on \nwhether modifying a term of imprisonment was or wasn\u2019t \n\u201cconsistent\u201d \nwith \na \nnon-existent \nset \nof \n\u201cpolicy \n\n- 39 - \n \nstatements.\u201d Instead, they (sensibly) read the text to \nmean that a sentence reduction must be consistent with \nthe applicable policy statements to the extent there are \nany. Id. at nn. 23\u201324 (explaining that eight of nine circuits \nwho considered the question took this view, with the \nEleventh Circuit as the lone \u201coutlier\u201d). \nAs the compassionate-release cases demonstrate, \n\u201ccourts can \u2026 find implied conditionality as a function of \na statute\u2019s syntax\u201d and \u201cthe nature of written language.\u201d \nEric S. Fish, Severability As Conditionality, 64 Emory \nL.J. 1293, 1337\u201339 (2015); Michael McCarthy & Ronald \nCarter, \nCambridge \nGrammar \nof \nEnglish: \nA \nComprehensive Guide 755\u201356 (2006) (explaining that \n\u201c[c]onditions can be conveyed without any overt \nconditional subordinator\u201d and that \u201cconditions can be \nexpressed\u201d with \u201cthe omission of conjunctions such as if\u201d); \nsee, e.g., Boesche v. Udall, 373 U.S. 472, 479 (1963) (in a \ncase where there was \u201cno lease to cancel,\u201d declining to \nread a provision on lease cancellation\u2014which \u201csp[oke] \nentirely in terms of post-lease occurrences\u201d and \n\u201cassume[d] the existence of a valid lease\u201d\u2014to render the \nAct as a whole \u201cself-defeating\u201d).3 \nIn each example above, the rule presumes that some \npredicate condition exists (you have an employer, luggage, \n \n3 The proposition that some sentences are implicitly conditional is \nunextraordinary. \u201cWhen a command is conditional, its condition may \nbe either overt or explicit on the one hand (\u2018When it rains, close the \nwindows!!\u2019) or tacit or implicit on the other (\u2018Drive carefully!\u2019 [means] \n\u2018When you drive, drive carefully!!\u2019).\u201d Nicholas Rescher, The Logic of \nCommands 24 (1966); see also Chi-H\u00e9 Elder, Context, Cognition, and \nConditionals 2 (2019) (\u201c[W]hile conditional sentences in English are \noften associated with the canonical form \u2018if p, q,\u2019 we also know that \nneither the use of \u2018if\u2019 nor a two-clause structure is essential for \nexpressing a conditional thought.\u201d). \n\n- 40 - \n \nor a phone; the program has eligibility requirements), and \nyour compliance with the rule is determined in relation to \nthat predicate. But as each example makes clear, the \nabsence of the thing presumed doesn\u2019t mean that you \nnecessarily violate the rule. Instead, it will often mean (as \nit does in each one of those examples) that the rule is \neffectively satisfied or that its requirement controls only \nto the extent that the predicate condition actually exists.  \nThe \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition in Title I can \neasily be read like each of those examples. The rule tests \nwhether an individual is sufficiently qualified for a job. See \nsupra 29\u201331. Where there is no job and there are no \n\u201cessential functions,\u201d the test is satisfied. And because its \napplication to retirees has no relationship to its textual \nfunction in the statute, common sense says it should not \nbe applied to bar claims by retirees who no longer \n\u201chold[]or desire[]\u201d an \u201cemployment position.\u201d See Biden v. \nNebraska, 143 S. Ct. 2355, 2379 (2023) (Barrett, J., \nconcurring) (\u201cContext also includes common sense.\u201d); The \nFederalist No. 83, at 559 (Alexander Hamilton) (\u201cThe \nrules of legal interpretation are rules of common sense.\u201d). \n2. Grammar. The grammatical structure of the \ndefinition\u2014and the role of the \u201cholds or desires\u201d clause in \nthe sentence in particular\u2014further demonstrates that the \ntext does not compel the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s reading. \nBecause \u201c[w]ords are to be given the meaning that proper \ngrammar and usage would assign them,\u201d Antonin Scalia & \nBryan A. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of \nLegal Texts 140 (2012), the \u201crules of grammar govern\u201d \nstatutory \ninterpretation \n\u201cunless \nthey \ncontradict \nlegislative intent or purpose,\u201d id. (citing Costello v. INS, \n376 U.S. 120, 122\u2013126 (1964)). \n\n- 41 - \n \nConsider this rule at an apartment complex: \u201cYou \nmust clean up after the pets that you own.\u201d Here, \u201cthat \nyou own\u201d tells us which pets we\u2019re talking about: the ones \nyou own, if you own any. It doesn\u2019t mean that you must \nown a pet, or that all pets are owned by you, or that you \nhave to clean up after other people\u2019s pets. The rule is \ntelling us that, if you own a pet, you\u2019ve got to clean up after \nit. Similarly, in the ADA\u2019s definition, the clause \u201cthat such \nindividual holds or desires\u201d modifies \u201cemployment \nposition.\u201d See Barnhart v. Thomas, 540 U.S. 20, 26 (2003) \n(\u201c[A] limiting clause or phrase \u2026 should ordinarily be \nread as modifying only the noun or phrase that it \nimmediately follows.\u201d). It is introduced by the pronoun \n\u201cthat,\u201d which sets up what grammarians call a \u201crestrictive \nclause.\u201d Bryan A. Garner, Modern English Usage 1086\u2013\n87 (5th ed. 2022). This clause simply tells us which \nposition\u2019s functions matter, see id.\u2014here, \u201cthe essential \nfunctions of the employment position that such individual \nholds or desires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8) (emphasis added). \nThe restrictive clause thus does not create a \nfreestanding temporal requirement that an individual \nmust currently hold a job. See Heredia v. Sessions, 865 \nF.3d 60, 69 (2d Cir. 2017) (explaining that \u201ca restrictive \nclause\u201d that modifies a noun in an immigration statute \n\u201cdoes not impose a separate temporal requirement\u201d). \nRather, \nit \nspecifies \nwhich \njob\u2019s \nfunctions \nare \nrelevant if the individual either holds or desires a job.  \nThe court of appeals, however, misread this clause. It \ntreated \u201cholds or desires\u201d as though it imposed a separate \nrequirement, rather than simply identifying the relevant \njob. This misreading assumes that a clause doing one thing \n(specifying which job matters) is instead doing something \nelse entirely (requiring current or future employment). \n\n- 42 - \n \nThe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s emphasis on the present tense-\nverbs thus reflects a basic misunderstanding of the \nrestrictive clause\u2019s grammatical function.  \n \n3. Logic. Reading the \u201cqualified individual\u201d \ndefinition to include retirees like Lt. Stanley not only \nreflects common sense and common usage but is also \nsound as a matter of basic logic: Lt. Stanley satisfies the \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition because she is not unable \nto perform the essential functions of any job that she \ncurrently holds or desires. The definition doesn\u2019t require \nher to be able to perform her former job; it only asks about \nher ability to perform the functions of a job that she now \n\u201cholds or desires,\u201d which is none.  \nThis simple conclusion\u2014that can perform is logically \nequivalent to not unable to perform\u2014follows from a basic \nprinciple of \u201cclassical logic.\u201d Bethel v. Jefferson, 589 F.2d \n631, 639 n.49 (D.C. Cir. 1978) (reasoning that a plaintiff \nwho wasn\u2019t in a \u201cunit\u201d of government \u201cin the competitive \nservice\u201d necessarily fell under a Title VII provision \ngoverning everyone else). It \u201cholds simply that every \nalternation of a sentence with its negation is true.\u201d Id. \n(quoting Willard Van Orman Quine, Philosophy of Logic \n15, 83\u201387 (1970)).4 \n \n4 This law of double negation comes from the \u201claw of the excluded \nmiddle,\u201d one of Aristotle\u2019s three laws of thought. Irving Copi, \nIntroduction to Logic 372\u201373 (1994). An explanation goes like this: \u201cIf \nyou have a proposition P, either P is true, or P is false; that is, either \nP is true or non-P is true. We cannot have a third possibility. As a \nconsequence of the excluded middle, we have the principle of double \nnegation: Negation of negation is equivalent to affirmation.\u201d Alain \nBadiou, The Three Negations, 29 Cardozo L. Rev. 1877, 1878 (2008).  \n\n- 43 - \n \nC. Reading \u201cqualified individual\u201d in context to \ninclude retirees is consistent with the \nstatutory scheme and avoids creating \nsurplusage and absurd consequences.  \nAs everything above demonstrates, the court of \nappeals\u2019 reading of the \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition is \ncertainly not compelled by the text. But reading the \ndefinition to include retirees isn\u2019t necessarily compelled \nby the text alone, either. The only way to answer the \nquestion is with some context. Indeed, \u201cinterpretation \nalways depends on context.\u201d Scalia & Garner, Reading \nLaw at 63; see Graham Cnty. Soil & Water Conservation \nDist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson, 545 U.S. 409, 415 \n(2005) (\u201cStatutory language has meaning only in \ncontext.\u201d). Ours is the only reading that makes sense of \nthe statutory scheme as a whole.  \n1. The text must be read in context, not in isolation. \nWe concede that some implicitly conditional rules that \nread like the \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition might be \nnaturally read in context as excluding those who can\u2019t \nsatisfy the condition. Others, however, go the other way. \nConsider these two airport security rules: \n(A) \u201cTo get through security, a passenger must \ncomplete an x-ray screening of the baggage that \nsuch individual carries.\u201d Can you get through with \nno bags? \n(B) \u201cTo get through security, a passenger must scan \nthe boarding pass that such individual carries.\u201d Can \nyou get through with no boarding pass?  \nThe syntax is the same. But our inclination is probably \nto say yes to the first question, and no to the second. If you \ndon\u2019t have a boarding pass, you likely won\u2019t get through. \n\n- 44 - \n \nYet we somehow know that the person without bags is in \nthe clear. A gadfly passenger might point out that rule (B) \nliterally only requires scanning a pass \u201cthat such \nindividual carries.\u201d That hyperliteralism likely won\u2019t \npersuade the security officers. But he\u2019d have a point\u2014 the \nrule surely could have been written more clearly to \nexpress that you must have a boarding pass: \u201cNo \nindividual may go through security without a boarding \npass.\u201d \nAs with the airport rules, Congress could have written \nthe \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition to more obviously \ninclude, or exclude, retirees. You might think that \nCongress could have clarified that retirees are covered by \nusing the word \u201cany.\u201d But referring to \u201cany employment \nposition that such individual \u2026 desires\u201d would have been \nawkward and confusing. The point of the restrictive clause \nis to tell us which position a job seeker must qualify for (a \nparticular position), not to suggest any position she might \nwant. So \u201cwe can see why a Congress,\u201d with our reading \nin mind, \u201cmight have chosen\u201d against \u201cany,\u201d despite its \nsurface appeal. Pulsifer, 601 U.S. at 138. The indefinite \narticle \u201can\u201d might have been clearer; but it too would have \ncarried a similar risk of confusion, which may explain why \nthe drafters used \u201cthe.\u201d (They were focused on tying \nqualifications to \u201cthe\u201d position at issue.)  \nEven if Congress had used \u201cany\u201d or \u201can,\u201d though, the \nCity would presumably still be here with the same \narguments. So it\u2019s not clear that even this would have \n\u201cdelivered us from interpretive controversy\u201d and ended \nthe \u201cgrammatical back-and-forth.\u201d Id. On the other hand, \nit would have been easy to clearly exclude retirees: \u201cA \nqualified individual means an individual who holds or \n\n- 45 - \n \ndesires an employment position and who can perform the \nessential functions of that position.\u201d  \nIn any event, conceding that Congress could have \ndrafted the definition more clearly to include retirees \ndoesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s not the right reading. See Gardner \nv. Collins, 27 U.S. 58, 86\u201387 (1829) (Story, J.) (holding that, \nalthough \u201cthe words \u2018if any there be\u2019 [were] omitted\u201d from \none version of the same statute, \u201cthe legislative intention \nin both acts was the same\u201d). This Court does not \u201cdemand \n(or in truth expect) that Congress draft in the most \ntranslucent way possible.\u201d Pulsifer, 601 U.S. at 137.   \u201cThe \nquestion, then, is not: Could Congress have indicated\u201d its \nintent to protect retirees \u201cin more crystalline fashion\u201d? \nTorres v. Lynch, 578 U.S. 452, 472\u201373 (2016). \u201cThe \nquestion is instead, and more simply: Is that the right and \nfair reading of the statute\u201d that Congress actually \nwrote? Id. at 473.   \nUltimately, there\u2019s no single \u201cgrammatical principle\u201d \nthat conclusively answers that question. Pulsifer, 601 U.S. \nat 137. Instead, what each of the examples shows is that \ndeciding whether a rule like this one includes or excludes \nretirees requires considering its \u201ccontent\u201d and \u201ccontext.\u201d \nId. at 138 n.5. \u201c[S]tated in the usual language of statutory \nconstruction, the answer [] lie[s] in considering the \n[definition\u2019s] text in its legal context.\u201d Id. at 141.  \n2. The statutory context makes clear that retirees \nare protected by the ADA.  \nReading the \u201ctext\u201d in \u201ccontext\u201d is how we know that \nretirees are \u201cqualified individual[s].\u201d Id. The definition\u2019s \ntext asks if you \u201ccan\u201d do a job. It asks that question \nbecause the provision\u2019s role is to screen out from the Act\u2019s \nprotections those who can\u2019t perform essential functions of \na job, and whose inclusion would therefore impede the \n\n- 46 - \n \nemployer\u2019s legitimate business prerogatives. See supra \n29\u201331. There\u2019s no \u201cplausible, or even cogent, explanation\u201d \nfor why a definition with this function would exclude \nretirees, who are not asked to perform any essential \nfunctions at all. Pulsifer, 601 U.S. at 148 n.7; see Scalia & \nGarner, Reading Law at 20 (explaining that an \u201cessential \nelement of context that gives meaning to words\u201d is the \n\u201cevident purpose of what a text seeks to achieve\u201d).  \nInterpreting \nthe \ndefinition \nto \ninclude \nformer \nemployees also avoids creating \u201csuperfluity.\u201d Pulsifer, \n601 U.S. at 142. On the court of appeals\u2019 reading, there\u2019s \nno role for the language limiting the reasonable-\naccommodation mandate to a \u201cqualified individual \u2026 who \nis an applicant or employee.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A). \nBy contrast, interpreting \u201cqualified individual\u201d to include \nretirees means that there is no surplusage; this, too, is \nrelevant \u201clegal context.\u201d Pulsifer, 601 U.S. at 141. \nThere\u2019s more. Recognizing that the definition does not \nexclude retirees gives force to the various provisions of the \nAct that protect retirees: Its inclusion of retirement \nbenefits as part and parcel of \u201ccompensation,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 12112(a), and its express allowance for a particular kind \n(but not the kind alleged in this case) of decision-making, \n\u201cbased on underwriting risks, classifying risks, [and] \nadministering such risks,\u201d when \u201cestablishing\u201d or \n\u201cadministering\u201d \u201cbenefit[s] plans,\u201d id. \u00a7 12201(c)(2).  \nThis reading also maintains congruity between the \nADA and Title VII, the statute on which much of Title I \nwas \u201cmodeled.\u201d Barnett, 535 U.S. at 420 (Souter, J., \ndissenting). As this Court made clear in Robinson v. Shell \nOil Co., many of Title VII\u2019s protections apply with full \nforce to \u201cformer employees.\u201d 519 U.S. at 342.  \n\n- 47 - \n \nFinally, \ninterpreting \nthe \n\u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d \ndefinition to include retirees avoids the absurd results that \nthe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s interpretation invites. The court of \nappeals\u2019 view means that employers are free to do the day \nafter retirement what they certainly could not do the day \nbefore. An employer motivated by nothing but raw animus \ncould lawfully strip a former employee who becomes \ndisabled after retiring of their benefits\u2014benefits that the \nstatute protects and that were earned while \u201cperform[ing] \nthe essential functions of the employment position\u201d the \nretiree held. And they could do so while openly stating \nthat the decision was based solely on their preference for \n\u201cnormal\u201d retirees over \u201cdisabled\u201d ones. See Doc. 1 at 12.  \nAn interpretation that allows that result\u2014which the \nEleventh Circuit\u2019s does\u2014would \u201cnegate [the ADA\u2019s] own \nstated purposes.\u201d New York State Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs. v. \nDublino, 413 U.S. 405, 420 (1973). Had Congress made a \ndeliberate choice to adopt that surprising and dramatic \ndeparture from the design of Title VII, it\u2019s hard to believe \nthat it would have done so through the use of present-\ntense verbs in an ambiguous restrictive clause at the end \nof a definitional provision. See Whitman v. Am. Trucking \nAss\u2019ns, 531 U.S. 457, 468 (2001) (\u201cCongress \u2026 does not, \none might say, hide elephants in mouseholes.\u201d). \nThe \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition might, \u201cat first \nblush,\u201d then, allow the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s interpretation. \nRobinson, 519 U.S. at 341. But any confidence in that first \nimpression gives way on a closer look, and resort to the \nordinary tools of statutory construction\u2014text and \u201cthe \nbroader context of\u201d the ADA\u2014all lead to the same \nconclusion: The ADA does not allow employers to freely \ndiscriminate against their former employees.

This brief will contain their interpretation of the ADA's text, their response to the circuit split, their view on precedent like *Robinson v. Shell Oil Co.*, and any policy arguments against the petitioner's position. It is the other half of the core legal dispute, and analyzing it is essential to evaluating the relative strengths of each side's case before the Justices.\n\nDesign EIG is moderate (0.5) because this action reinforces a fundamental and non-negotiable step in the legal reasoning process: always analyze the primary briefs from both parties. While not a novel strategy, successfully executing this step and using its output confirms the validity and importance of this core heuristic for any case. It helps solidify the agent's foundational workflow for SCOTUS prediction, ensuring a balanced and comprehensive approach is always taken.\n\nThe joint EIG is high because this action is both crucial for the specific task and reinforces a cornerstone of the overall prediction strategy.",

That issue is whether discrimination \noccurring entirely post-employment against totally \ndisabled former employees, is actionable under Title I \nof the ADA. The Eleventh Circuit, joining the majority \nof courts, correctly held that Title I unambiguously \nprohibits discrimination solely against an individual \nwho \u201ccan perform\u201d the job she presently \u201cholds or \ndesires.\u201d Thus, it concluded that because Petitioner \ncould not establish that the City committed any \ndiscriminatory acts against her while she could \nperform the essential functions of a job that she held \nor desired to hold, her Title I claim failed. \nIn Part I of her brief, Petitioner raises an \nargument that she not only failed to press below, but \nthat she expressly disclaimed. She untimely argues \nshe \nwas \ndiscriminated \nagainst \nduring \nher \nemployment when she was a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d \nHowever, she conceded in her initial brief below that \nshe could not have brought these claims while she was \nstill employed and able to do her job because she would \nhave lacked standing. The Eleventh Circuit properly \ndeclined to decide her opposite position untimely \nraised for the first time in her reply brief.  \nThis Court \u201cdoes not \u2018[o]rdinarily...decide in the \nfirst instance issues not decided below.\u2019\u201d City of \nAustin, Texas v. Reagan Nat'l Advert. of Austin, LLC, \n596 U.S. 61, 76 (2022). Therefore, Petitioner\u2019s \ncontention that this Court \u201cneed not reach\u201d the circuit-\nsplit question and should reverse on the issue she \ndisclaimed, should be rejected. This Court should only \n\n2 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nconsider the circuit-split question. But to the extent \nthis Court reviews the question not pressed or passed \nupon, it should find that Petitioner\u2019s unpreserved \nclaims of discrimination during employment are \nunpled and time-barred. The Ledbetter Act has no \nplace here to save her waived claims allegedly \naccruing two decades ago.  \nPetitioner incorrectly claims that the Eleventh \nCircuit held that a disabled retired firefighter may be \nsubjected to discrimination with impunity. It said \nnothing of the sort. And \u201c[i]t seems more than \nuncharitable to say,\u201d Kincaid v. Williams, 143 S. Ct. \n2414, 2418 (2023) (Alito, J., dissenting), that the court \nof appeal\u2019s finding of an unambiguous limitation on \nTitle I\u2019s prohibitions is the same as finding that a \nretiree \u201cmay be subjected to discrimination with \nimpunity.\u201d  \nThe Eleventh Circuit also did not hold that former \nemployees can never sue under Title I regarding post-\nemployment benefits. It held that discrimination \noccurring during employment against a \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d is actionable under the ADA. And for \nalleged discrimination post-employment, there are \nnumerous remedies under other federal and state \nlaws. Thus, Petitioner\u2019s claims failed, not for lack of \nremedy or an incorrect interpretation of the ADA, but \nbecause of her allegations and litigation strategy. This \nCourt should affirm.  \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent statutory provisions are reproduced in \nthe appendix to this brief.  \n\n3 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Statutory Background \n1. In enacting the Americans with Disabilities \nAct, Congress found, in part, that \u201csociety has tended \nto isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(a)(2). Congress enacted Title I of the \nADA to provide legal remedies for discrimination \nagainst disabled workers that did not previously exist. \nSee 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(a)(4). At the time, several other \nfederal statutes existed for the protection of employee \nretirement benefits such as ERISA and the Social \nSecurity Act. The Equal Protection Clause provided an \nadditional remedy for public employees. See Tennessee \nv. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 522 (2004) (\u201cemphasiz[ing] that \nthe House and Senate Committee Reports on the ADA \nfocused on \u2018[d]iscrimination [in]...employment in the \nprivate sector,\u2019 and made no mention of discrimination \nin public employment.\u201d) (emphasis added by the \nCourt). \nThis Court has also \u201cidentified Title I\u2019s purpose as \nenforcement of the Fourteenth Amendment's [equal \nprotection] command that \u2018all persons similarly \nsituated should be treated alike.\u2019\u201d Id. Thus, except as \nto the ADA\u2019s requirement that employers provide \n\u201creasonable accommodations\u201d for the disabled, 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A), the essence of the ADA is \nequal\u2014not preferential\u2014treatment for the disabled. \nSee Williams v. United Ins. Co. of Am., 253 F.3d 280, \n282 (7th Cir. 2001) (an \u201cemployer is not required to \ngive the disabled employee preferential treatment.\u201d). \n\u201cThe ADA requires only that persons with disabilities \nhave the opportunity to receive the same benefits as \nnon-disabled officers who have given an equivalent \n\n4 \n\u0003\n\u0003\namount of service.\u201d Castellano v. City of New York, 142 \nF.3d 58, 70 (2d Cir. 1998). \n2. The ADA\u2019s prohibition against discrimination \nin employment is codified in Title I: \n(a) General rule. No covered entity shall \ndiscriminate \nagainst \na \nqualified \nindividual on the basis of disability in \nregard to job application procedures, \nthe hiring, advancement, or discharge \nof employees, employee compensation, \njob \ntraining, \nand \nother \nterms, \nconditions, \nand \nprivileges \nof \nemployment. \n \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a) (emphasis added). The term of art \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d is incorporated into the general \nrule and defines the class of individuals protected by \nits prohibition against discrimination: \n \nThe term \u201cqualified individual\u201d means an \nindividual \nwho, \nwith \nor \nwithout \nreasonable accommodation, can perform \nthe essential functions of the employment \nposition that such individual holds or \ndesires. \n \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8). \u201cThe determination of whether a \nperson is qualified should be made at the time of the \nemployment action, e.g. hiring or promotion...\u201d H.R. \nRep. No. 101\u2013485(III), at 34 (1990).  \n \n3. While Title I \u201cborrows much of its procedural \nframework from [T]itle VII,\u201d it \u201cborrows much of its \n\n5 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nsubstantive framework from Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973.\u201d Id. at 31. The \u201cconcept\u201d of \na \u201cqualified individual\u201d comes from \u201cthe regulations \nimplementing...the Rehabilitation Act\u201d\u2014not from \nTitle VII. Id. at 33; see also Alexander v. Choate, 469 \nU.S. 287, 309 (1985) (no unlawful discrimination \nfound under the Rehabilitation Act because the state's \npolicy was \u201cneutral on its face\u201d and it \u201cmade the same \nbenefit...equally accessible to both handicapped and \nnonhandicapped persons\u2026\u201d). \nB. Factual Background \n1. Because Petitioner argues that the Eleventh \nCircuit erred in affirming the dismissal of her ADA \nclaim at the pleading stage, the facts should be taken \nfrom her complaint only. Petitioner\u2019s statement of the \nfacts, however, largely draws from the evidence \ndeveloped at the summary judgment stage on her \nEqual Protection Clause claim. The pertinent factual \nallegations from her complaint are as follows.  \nPetitioner alleged that when she was hired in \n1999, the City \u201cpaid for health insurance for its \nemployees who retired after 25 years of service and its \nemployees who retired on account of disability\u201d until \n\u201cthe age of 65.\u201d Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 13, 19. In 2018, she accepted \na disability retirement because she was completely \nunable to perform her duties as a firefighter due to an \nunidentified \u201cphysical disability.\u201d Id. \u00b6 16. \nFifteen years before she retired, the City changed \nits policy in 2003 to require all retirees to complete 25 \nyears\u2019 service to earn the subsidy to age 65. See id. \u00b6\u00b6 \n19, 24. But the change still treated disability retirees \nbetter than similarly situated non-disabled retirees \n\n6 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nwith less than 25 years because while the latter \nreceived nothing, the former received the subsidy for \n24 months or until their receipt of Medicare benefits, \nwhichever came first. Id. \u00b6 24.  \nPetitioner, however, did not sue the City for \nbreach of an employment contract or bring an \nunconstitutional takings claim based on the change. \nThus, Petitioner\u2019s statement that the City \u201cpromised\u201d \nher the benefits under the defunct policy from 15 years \nbefore \nshe \nretired, \nis \nfactually \nand \nlegally \nunsupported. Pet. Br. 11. Petitioner only had a vested \nright to benefits under a policy \u201cin effect at the time\u201d \nof her retirement. City of Hollywood v. Bien, 209 So. \n3d 1, 3 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2016). \nWhile Petitioner claims the policy change was \nmade \u201cquietly,\u201d Pet. Br. 10, her complaint actually \nalleges a public announcement of the policy because it \nwas \u201ccodified in City Policy Section 2.45(c)\u201d of its \nordinances, and in its \u201cofficial personnel policies.\u201d Doc. \n1, \u00b6 24; see also Doc. 38-10 at 2-5; Doc. 38-11 at 4. Her \ncomplaint does not allege that she was unaware of the \npersonnel policy or the ordinance at the time of its \npassage or when she retired.  \nBecause she was totally disabled and unable to \nwork, Petitioner retired early with only 20 years\u2019 \nservice instead of the 25 required to earn the subsidy \nto age 65. Doc. 1, \u00b6 16. Her complaint did not allege \nwhen she became disabled or that she continued to \nwork thereafter as a \u201cqualified individual\u201d with a \ndisability before she retired. Petitioner only alleged \nthat because of a \u201cphysical disability\u201d she took a \ndisability retirement in November 2018 and as a \nresult, the City\u2019s subsidy policy would be applied to \n\n7 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nher, and she would lose the subsidy in November of \n2020\u201424 months after her retirement date. Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 \n16, 26.  \n2. Petitioner erroneously claims that the City\u2019s \nsubsidy \npolicy \ndistinguished \nbetween \n\u201cnormal \nretirees\u201d and disabled retirees. Pet. Br. 11.1 However, \nthe phrase \u201cnormal retiree\u201d appears nowhere in the \nordinance. See Doc. 38-10 at 2-5. Rather, the ordinance \nshows that any retiree, disabled or non-disabled, with \n25 years of service is eligible for the subsidy to age 65. \nDoc. 38-10 at 4, \u00b6 2.45(C), (G). The ordinance did not \ncondition the subsidy to age 65 on a \u201cnormal \nretirement\u201d because under the City\u2019s pension plan, a \n\u201cnormal retirement\u201d could be taken after only ten (10) \nyears of service. Doc. 39-17 at 27; J.A. 35, n. 2.  \nPetitioner, like everyone else, was eligible to \nreceive the full subsidy so long as she served 25 years. \nHowever, in 2018, she requested and was awarded a \n\u201cdisability retirement\u201d with only 20 years of service. \nDoc. 38-5.2 But even though she failed to fulfill the \nservice-based criteria, the City, out of compassion, \nprovided 24 months of the subsidy to its totally \ndisabled retirees who retired early short of 25 years. \nDoc. 38-10 at 4, \u00b6 2.45(C), (F), (G); J.A. 34-35, 40; Doc. \n38 at 21-22. Uncoincidentally, 24 months is exactly \nhow long it takes before a totally disabled retiree like \nPetitioner is eligible to receive Medicare benefits. See \nMedicare Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 426(b)(2)(A), 1395o(a)(1). \n\u0003\n1 Petitioner cites to Doc. 39-16 for this proposition but omits key \nlanguage from that document which shows that the policy was \nbased solely on years of service and not a \u201cnormal\u201d retirement.  \n2 Petitioner insinuates that she was disabled \u201cin the line of duty.\u201d \nPet. Br. 1, 11. The record shows she was not. Doc. 38-5. \n\n8 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nSimilarly situated, non-disabled retirees with only 20 \nyears\u2019 service received no subsidy at all and they are \nnot Medicare eligible because they are not disabled. \nDoc. 38-10 at 4, \u00b6 2.45(C); J.A. 34-35, 44. Thus, far \nfrom treating Petitioner worse because of her \ndisability than her non-disabled co-workers with the \nsame amount of service, she was treated better than \nthem because of her total disability.  \nAlthough the City would have liked to continue \npaying disability retirees with less than 25 years the \nsame subsidy as 25-year retirees, it was forced to cut \ncosts and start treating disability retirees the same as, \nrather than better than, everyone else with less than \n25 years of service. Doc. 38-10 at 2; J.A. 34 n. 1, 40. \nPrior to the 2003 ordinance, the City had the resources \nto pay the subsidy to age 65 for both 25-year retirees \nand \u201cdisability retirees\u201d with less than 25 years. \nHowever, the City was permitted to change that policy \nbefore Petitioner\u2019s rights vested at retirement. Florida \nSheriffs Ass'n v. Dep't of Admin., Div. of Ret., 408 So. \n2d 1033, 1036-37 (Fla. 1981). \nPetitioner claims (at 11) that the City\u2019s HR \nDirector could not explain why the City changed the \nsubsidy policy. He was deposed nearly twenty years \nafter the ordinance was passed and thus his \nknowledge of it was limited to what could be discerned \nfrom the public records. Doc. 39-4 at 1, 10, 80. The \ndistrict court found that the purpose was clearly set \nforth in the ordinance itself and the City articulated \nits legitimate reasons for its service-based policy to \nreward long-term employment, contain costs, and \nprovide compassion for employees who retire early due \nto disability. J.A. 34 n. 1, 40, 45. The City\u2019s policy \n\n9 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nprovided disabled employees access to the same \nbenefits available to all. Doc. 38-10 at 4, \u00b6 2.45(C).  \nC. Procedural Background \n1. The City moved to dismiss Petitioner\u2019s ADA \nclaim because she only alleged post-employment \ndiscrimination when she was no longer a \u201cqualified \nindividual.\u201d Doc. 14 at 4-5. Petitioner did not dispute \nthe City\u2019s characterization of her allegations or argue \nthat her complaint actually alleged discrimination \nduring her employment. See Doc. 17. Petitioner also \ndid not move for leave to amend to add allegations of \ndiscrimination during employment. \nTherefore, \nthe \ndistrict \ncourt \ndismissed \nPetitioner\u2019s ADA claim because she alleged the \n\u201cdiscrimination did not occur until Plaintiff was no \nlonger able to perform the essential functions of her \njob\u201d when she was no longer a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d \nPet. App. 26a. After dismissal, Petitioner did not move \nfor reconsideration arguing the court misapprehended \nany allegations of discrimination during employment.  \nOn her Equal Protection Clause Claim, the \ndistrict court found the policy drew \u201cneutral\u201d lines \nbased on service requiring all retirees to serve 25 \nyears to earn the subsidy to age 65. J.A. 44-45. \n2. Petitioner\u2019s initial brief in the Eleventh Circuit \nconfirmed that her complaint only alleged post-\nemployment discrimination because she argued she \n\u201ccould not have brought these claims while she was \nstill employed\u201d because \u201cshe would have lacked \nstanding.\u201d Pet. C.A. Br. 22. The Eleventh Circuit \ntherefore refused to pass upon this issue expressly \n\n10 \n\u0003\n\u0003\ndisclaimed \nin \nher \ninitial \nbrief \nand \nuntimely \ncontradicted in her reply brief. Pet. App. 17a.  \nNext, the Eleventh Circuit analyzed whether the \nCity\u2019s post-employment application of the subsidy \npolicy was, in its own right, a fresh violation of Title I, \nrather \nthan \nan \nalleged \nextension \nof \npast \ndiscrimination. Pet. App. 16a. In doing so, it found \nthat nothing in the Ledbetter Act \u201cchanges Title I\u2019s \nsubstantive requirements,\u201d including the requirement \nthat one be a \u201cqualified individual\u201d at the time of the \ndiscriminatory act. Pet. App. 15a. It held the \nLedbetter Act\u2019s \u201crelaxed statute of limitations helps a \nplaintiff only if that plaintiff otherwise has a claim for \ndiscrimination.\u201d Id.  \nTher\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

The Eleventh Circuit, joining the majority \nof courts, correctly held that Title I unambiguously \nprohibits discrimination solely against an individual \nwho \u201ccan perform\u201d the job she presently \u201cholds or \ndesires.\u201d Thus, it concluded that because Petitioner \ncould not establish that the City committed any \ndiscriminatory acts against her while she could \nperform the essential functions of a job that she held \nor desired to hold, her Title I claim failed. \nIn Part I of her brief, Petitioner raises an \nargument that she not only failed to press below, but \nthat she expressly disclaimed. She untimely argues \nshe \nwas \ndiscriminated \nagainst \nduring \nher \nemployment when she was a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d \nHowever, she conceded in her initial brief below that \nshe could not have brought these claims while she was \nstill employed and able to do her job because she would \nhave lacked standing. The Eleventh Circuit properly \ndeclined to decide her opposite position untimely \nraised for the first time in her reply brief.  \nThis Court \u201cdoes not \u2018[o]rdinarily...decide in the \nfirst instance issues not decided below.\u2019\u201d City of \nAustin, Texas v. Reagan Nat'l Advert. of Austin, LLC, \n596 U.S. 61, 76 (2022). Therefore, Petitioner\u2019s \ncontention that this Court \u201cneed not reach\u201d the circuit-\nsplit question and should reverse on the issue she \ndisclaimed, should be rejected. This Court should only \n\n2 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nconsider the circuit-split question. But to the extent \nthis Court reviews the question not pressed or passed \nupon, it should find that Petitioner\u2019s unpreserved \nclaims of discrimination during employment are \nunpled and time-barred. The Ledbetter Act has no \nplace here to save her waived claims allegedly \naccruing two decades ago.  \nPetitioner incorrectly claims that the Eleventh \nCircuit held that a disabled retired firefighter may be \nsubjected to discrimination with impunity. It said \nnothing of the sort. And \u201c[i]t seems more than \nuncharitable to say,\u201d Kincaid v. Williams, 143 S. Ct. \n2414, 2418 (2023) (Alito, J., dissenting), that the court \nof appeal\u2019s finding of an unambiguous limitation on \nTitle I\u2019s prohibitions is the same as finding that a \nretiree \u201cmay be subjected to discrimination with \nimpunity.\u201d  \nThe Eleventh Circuit also did not hold that former \nemployees can never sue under Title I regarding post-\nemployment benefits. It held that discrimination \noccurring during employment against a \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d is actionable under the ADA. And for \nalleged discrimination post-employment, there are \nnumerous remedies under other federal and state \nlaws. Thus, Petitioner\u2019s claims failed, not for lack of \nremedy or an incorrect interpretation of the ADA, but \nbecause of her allegations and litigation strategy. This \nCourt should affirm.  \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent statutory provisions are reproduced in \nthe appendix to this brief.  \n\n3 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Statutory Background \n1. In enacting the Americans with Disabilities \nAct, Congress found, in part, that \u201csociety has tended \nto isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(a)(2). Congress enacted Title I of the \nADA to provide legal remedies for discrimination \nagainst disabled workers that did not previously exist. \nSee 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(a)(4). At the time, several other \nfederal statutes existed for the protection of employee \nretirement benefits such as ERISA and the Social \nSecurity Act. The Equal Protection Clause provided an \nadditional remedy for public employees. See Tennessee \nv. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 522 (2004) (\u201cemphasiz[ing] that \nthe House and Senate Committee Reports on the ADA \nfocused on \u2018[d]iscrimination [in]...employment in the \nprivate sector,\u2019 and made no mention of discrimination \nin public employment.\u201d) (emphasis added by the \nCourt). \nThis Court has also \u201cidentified Title I\u2019s purpose as \nenforcement of the Fourteenth Amendment's [equal \nprotection] command that \u2018all persons similarly \nsituated should be treated alike.\u2019\u201d Id. Thus, except as \nto the ADA\u2019s requirement that employers provide \n\u201creasonable accommodations\u201d for the disabled, 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A), the essence of the ADA is \nequal\u2014not preferential\u2014treatment for the disabled. \nSee Williams v. United Ins. Co. of Am., 253 F.3d 280, \n282 (7th Cir. 2001) (an \u201cemployer is not required to \ngive the disabled employee preferential treatment.\u201d). \n\u201cThe ADA requires only that persons with disabilities \nhave the opportunity to receive the same benefits as \nnon-disabled officers who have given an equivalent \n\n4 \n\u0003\n\u0003\namount of service.\u201d Castellano v. City of New York, 142 \nF.3d 58, 70 (2d Cir. 1998). \n2. The ADA\u2019s prohibition against discrimination \nin employment is codified in Title I: \n(a) General rule. No covered entity shall \ndiscriminate \nagainst \na \nqualified \nindividual on the basis of disability in \nregard to job application procedures, \nthe hiring, advancement, or discharge \nof employees, employee compensation, \njob \ntraining, \nand \nother \nterms, \nconditions, \nand \nprivileges \nof \nemployment. \n \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a) (emphasis added). The term of art \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d is incorporated into the general \nrule and defines the class of individuals protected by \nits prohibition against discrimination: \n \nThe term \u201cqualified individual\u201d means an \nindividual \nwho, \nwith \nor \nwithout \nreasonable accommodation, can perform \nthe essential functions of the employment \nposition that such individual holds or \ndesires. \n \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8). \u201cThe determination of whether a \nperson is qualified should be made at the time of the \nemployment action, e.g. hiring or promotion...\u201d H.R. \nRep. No. 101\u2013485(III), at 34 (1990).  \n \n3. While Title I \u201cborrows much of its procedural \nframework from [T]itle VII,\u201d it \u201cborrows much of its \n\n5 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nsubstantive framework from Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973.\u201d Id. at 31. The \u201cconcept\u201d of \na \u201cqualified individual\u201d comes from \u201cthe regulations \nimplementing...the Rehabilitation Act\u201d\u2014not from \nTitle VII. Id. at 33; see also Alexander v. Choate, 469 \nU.S. 287, 309 (1985) (no unlawful discrimination \nfound under the Rehabilitation Act because the state's \npolicy was \u201cneutral on its face\u201d and it \u201cmade the same \nbenefit...equally accessible to both handicapped and \nnonhandicapped persons\u2026\u201d). \nB. Factual Background \n1. Because Petitioner argues that the Eleventh \nCircuit erred in affirming the dismissal of her ADA \nclaim at the pleading stage, the facts should be taken \nfrom her complaint only. Petitioner\u2019s statement of the \nfacts, however, largely draws from the evidence \ndeveloped at the summary judgment stage on her \nEqual Protection Clause claim. The pertinent factual \nallegations from her complaint are as follows.  \nPetitioner alleged that when she was hired in \n1999, the City \u201cpaid for health insurance for its \nemployees who retired after 25 years of service and its \nemployees who retired on account of disability\u201d until \n\u201cthe age of 65.\u201d Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 13, 19. In 2018, she accepted \na disability retirement because she was completely \nunable to perform her duties as a firefighter due to an \nunidentified \u201cphysical disability.\u201d Id. \u00b6 16. \nFifteen years before she retired, the City changed \nits policy in 2003 to require all retirees to complete 25 \nyears\u2019 service to earn the subsidy to age 65. See id. \u00b6\u00b6 \n19, 24. But the change still treated disability retirees \nbetter than similarly situated non-disabled retirees \n\n6 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nwith less than 25 years because while the latter \nreceived nothing, the former received the subsidy for \n24 months or until their receipt of Medicare benefits, \nwhichever came first. Id. \u00b6 24.  \nPetitioner, however, did not sue the City for \nbreach of an employment contract or bring an \nunconstitutional takings claim based on the change. \nThus, Petitioner\u2019s statement that the City \u201cpromised\u201d \nher the benefits under the defunct policy from 15 years \nbefore \nshe \nretired, \nis \nfactually \nand \nlegally \nunsupported. Pet. Br. 11. Petitioner only had a vested \nright to benefits under a policy \u201cin effect at the time\u201d \nof her retirement. City of Hollywood v. Bien, 209 So. \n3d 1, 3 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2016). \nWhile Petitioner claims the policy change was \nmade \u201cquietly,\u201d Pet. Br. 10, her complaint actually \nalleges a public announcement of the policy because it \nwas \u201ccodified in City Policy Section 2.45(c)\u201d of its \nordinances, and in its \u201cofficial personnel policies.\u201d Doc. \n1, \u00b6 24; see also Doc. 38-10 at 2-5; Doc. 38-11 at 4. Her \ncomplaint does not allege that she was unaware of the \npersonnel policy or the ordinance at the time of its \npassage or when she retired.  \nBecause she was totally disabled and unable to \nwork, Petitioner retired early with only 20 years\u2019 \nservice instead of the 25 required to earn the subsidy \nto age 65. Doc. 1, \u00b6 16. Her complaint did not allege \nwhen she became disabled or that she continued to \nwork thereafter as a \u201cqualified individual\u201d with a \ndisability before she retired. Petitioner only alleged \nthat because of a \u201cphysical disability\u201d she took a \ndisability retirement in November 2018 and as a \nresult, the City\u2019s subsidy policy would be applied to \n\n7 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nher, and she would lose the subsidy in November of \n2020\u201424 months after her retirement date. Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 \n16, 26.  \n2. Petitioner erroneously claims that the City\u2019s \nsubsidy \npolicy \ndistinguished \nbetween \n\u201cnormal \nretirees\u201d and disabled retirees. Pet. Br. 11.1 However, \nthe phrase \u201cnormal retiree\u201d appears nowhere in the \nordinance. See Doc. 38-10 at 2-5. Rather, the ordinance \nshows that any retiree, disabled or non-disabled, with \n25 years of service is eligible for the subsidy to age 65. \nDoc. 38-10 at 4, \u00b6 2.45(C), (G). The ordinance did not \ncondition the subsidy to age 65 on a \u201cnormal \nretirement\u201d because under the City\u2019s pension plan, a \n\u201cnormal retirement\u201d could be taken after only ten (10) \nyears of service. Doc. 39-17 at 27; J.A. 35, n. 2.  \nPetitioner, like everyone else, was eligible to \nreceive the full subsidy so long as she served 25 years. \nHowever, in 2018, she requested and was awarded a \n\u201cdisability retirement\u201d with only 20 years of service. \nDoc. 38-5.2 But even though she failed to fulfill the \nservice-based criteria, the City, out of compassion, \nprovided 24 months of the subsidy to its totally \ndisabled retirees who retired early short of 25 years. \nDoc. 38-10 at 4, \u00b6 2.45(C), (F), (G); J.A. 34-35, 40; Doc. \n38 at 21-22. Uncoincidentally, 24 months is exactly \nhow long it takes before a totally disabled retiree like \nPetitioner is eligible to receive Medicare benefits. See \nMedicare Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 426(b)(2)(A), 1395o(a)(1). \n\u0003\n1 Petitioner cites to Doc. 39-16 for this proposition but omits key \nlanguage from that document which shows that the policy was \nbased solely on years of service and not a \u201cnormal\u201d retirement.  \n2 Petitioner insinuates that she was disabled \u201cin the line of duty.\u201d \nPet. Br. 1, 11. The record shows she was not. Doc. 38-5. \n\n8 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nSimilarly situated, non-disabled retirees with only 20 \nyears\u2019 service received no subsidy at all and they are \nnot Medicare eligible because they are not disabled. \nDoc. 38-10 at 4, \u00b6 2.45(C); J.A. 34-35, 44. Thus, far \nfrom treating Petitioner worse because of her \ndisability than her non-disabled co-workers with the \nsame amount of service, she was treated better than \nthem because of her total disability.  \nAlthough the City would have liked to continue \npaying disability retirees with less than 25 years the \nsame subsidy as 25-year retirees, it was forced to cut \ncosts and start treating disability retirees the same as, \nrather than better than, everyone else with less than \n25 years of service. Doc. 38-10 at 2; J.A. 34 n. 1, 40. \nPrior to the 2003 ordinance, the City had the resources \nto pay the subsidy to age 65 for both 25-year retirees \nand \u201cdisability retirees\u201d with less than 25 years. \nHowever, the City was permitted to change that policy \nbefore Petitioner\u2019s rights vested at retirement. Florida \nSheriffs Ass'n v. Dep't of Admin., Div. of Ret., 408 So. \n2d 1033, 1036-37 (Fla. 1981). \nPetitioner claims (at 11) that the City\u2019s HR \nDirector could not explain why the City changed the \nsubsidy policy. He was deposed nearly twenty years \nafter the ordinance was passed and thus his \nknowledge of it was limited to what could be discerned \nfrom the public records. Doc. 39-4 at 1, 10, 80. The \ndistrict court found that the purpose was clearly set \nforth in the ordinance itself and the City articulated \nits legitimate reasons for its service-based policy to \nreward long-term employment, contain costs, and \nprovide compassion for employees who retire early due \nto disability. J.A. 34 n. 1, 40, 45. The City\u2019s policy \n\n9 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nprovided disabled employees access to the same \nbenefits available to all. Doc. 38-10 at 4, \u00b6 2.45(C).  \nC. Procedural Background \n1. The City moved to dismiss Petitioner\u2019s ADA \nclaim because she only alleged post-employment \ndiscrimination when she was no longer a \u201cqualified \nindividual.\u201d Doc. 14 at 4-5. Petitioner did not dispute \nthe City\u2019s characterization of her allegations or argue \nthat her complaint actually alleged discrimination \nduring her employment. See Doc. 17. Petitioner also \ndid not move for leave to amend to add allegations of \ndiscrimination during employment. \nTherefore, \nthe \ndistrict \ncourt \ndismissed \nPetitioner\u2019s ADA claim because she alleged the \n\u201cdiscrimination did not occur until Plaintiff was no \nlonger able to perform the essential functions of her \njob\u201d when she was no longer a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d \nPet. App. 26a. After dismissal, Petitioner did not move \nfor reconsideration arguing the court misapprehended \nany allegations of discrimination during employment.  \nOn her Equal Protection Clause Claim, the \ndistrict court found the policy drew \u201cneutral\u201d lines \nbased on service requiring all retirees to serve 25 \nyears to earn the subsidy to age 65. J.A. 44-45. \n2. Petitioner\u2019s initial brief in the Eleventh Circuit \nconfirmed that her complaint only alleged post-\nemployment discrimination because she argued she \n\u201ccould not have brought these claims while she was \nstill employed\u201d because \u201cshe would have lacked \nstanding.\u201d Pet. C.A. Br. 22. The Eleventh Circuit \ntherefore refused to pass upon this issue expressly \n\n10 \n\u0003\n\u0003\ndisclaimed \nin \nher \ninitial \nbrief \nand \nuntimely \ncontradicted in her reply brief. Pet. App. 17a.  \nNext, the Eleventh Circuit analyzed whether the \nCity\u2019s post-employment application of the subsidy \npolicy was, in its own right, a fresh violation of Title I, \nrather \nthan \nan \nalleged \nextension \nof \npast \ndiscrimination. Pet. App. 16a. In doing so, it found \nthat nothing in the Ledbetter Act \u201cchanges Title I\u2019s \nsubstantive requirements,\u201d including the requirement \nthat one be a \u201cqualified individual\u201d at the time of the \ndiscriminatory act. Pet. App. 15a. It held the \nLedbetter Act\u2019s \u201crelaxed statute of limitations helps a \nplaintiff only if that plaintiff otherwise has a claim for \ndiscrimination.\u201d Id.  \nTherefore, it adhered to its precedent holding that \nTitle I is unambiguous and contains a \u201cclear temporal \nqualifier\u201d stating \u201c[o]nly someone \u2018who, with or \nwithout reasonable accommodation, can perform the \nessential functions of the employment position that \nsuch individual holds or desires\u201d is protected from \ndisability discrimination. Pet. App. 11a (emphasis in \noriginal). It concluded that \u201c[b]ecause Stanley cannot \nestablish that the City committed any discriminatory \nacts against her while she could perform the essential \nfunctions of a job that she held or desired to hold, her \nTitle I claim fails.\u201d Pet. App. 18a. \n\u0003\n \n\n11 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI. Part I of Petitioner\u2019s brief is unrelated to the \ncircuit-split question upon which this Court granted \ncertiorari regarding whether discrimination occurring \nentirely post-employment is actionable under the \nADA. Instead, Part I seeks review of a different \nquestion regarding whether Petitioner sufficiently \nalleged discrimination during her employment as a \n\u201cqualified individual.\u201d Petitioner argues her ADA \nclaim allegedly accrued in 2003 when the City passed \nits subsidy policy. She admits she was not disabled at \nthat time but argues Title I did not require her to have \na disability to sue for disability discrimination. She \nheavily relies on the minimal standing requirements \nin the enforcement provisions of Title I and Title VII. \nBut Title I\u2019s enforcement provision only applies to \n\u201cany person alleging discrimination on the basis of \ndisability in violation of any provision of this chapter.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12117(a) (emphasis added). This is a \n\u201ccross-reference\u2026directing us to a class of claims with \na settled and statutorily precise meaning.\u201d Almond v. \nUnified Sch. Dist. No. 501, 665 F.3d 1174, 1181 (10th \nCir. 2011).  \nThe ADA\u2019s \u201cclass of claims\u201d are found in its \nsubstantive anti-discrimination provision, \u00a7 12112(a), \nwhich has a settled meaning requiring Petitioner to \nshow: \u201c(1) that she was disabled under the ADA; (2) \nthat she was a qualified individual with a disability; \nand (3) that she was discriminated against by her \nemployer because of that disability.\u201d Dunlap v. Liberty \nNat. Prod., Inc., 878 F.3d 794, 798\u201399 (9th Cir. 2017). \nBecause Petitioner conceded that she did not have a \ndisability in 2003 and further conceded that she \n\n12 \n\u0003\n\u0003\n\u201clacked standing\u201d to sue for anything occurring \u201cwhile \nshe was still employed,\u201d Pet. C.A. Br. 22, the Eleventh \nCircuit correctly declined to pass upon whether her \nallegations sufficiently alleged she was discriminated \nagainst as a \u201cqualified individual\u201d at any time before \nshe retired.  Pet. App. 17a. \nThe Eleventh Circuit also correctly held that the \nLedbetter Act did not change Title I\u2019s substantive \nrequirement that she be a \u201cqualified individual\u201d with \na disability at the time of the alleged discrimination. \nId. 15a. Because she only alleged discrimination \noccurring entirely post-employment when she could no \nlonger perform the essential functions of her job, she \nwas not a \u201cqualified individual\u201d entitled to sue.  \nII. The Eleventh Circuit correctly held that Title \nI\u2019s use of the present tense unambiguously prohibits \ndiscrimination solely against an individual who \u201ccan \nperform\u201d the job she presently \u201cholds or desires.\u201d Id. \n11a-12a. This reading is consistent with the ADA\u2019s \nstatutory scheme which uses the term \u201cindividuals\u201d to \nbroadly include former employees, but \u201cqualified \nindividuals\u201d to refer only to current employees. And it \ngives effect to every word in the definition and the \ngeneral rule where it appears.  \nPetitioner\u2019s interpretation requires this Court to \nrewrite Title I to include an exception to the \u201ccan \nperform\u201d clause for retirees. It is based on a policy \npreference to avoid what she perceives as an \u201cabsurd\u201d \nconsequence of the express line drawn by Congress. \nHowever, \u201cCongress could reasonably decide to enable \ndisabled people who can work with reasonable \naccommodation to get and keep jobs, without also \ndeciding to equalize post-employment fringe benefits \n\n13 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nfor people who cannot work.\u201d Weyer v. Twentieth \nCentury Fox Film Corp., 198 F.3d 1104, 1112 (9th Cir. \n2000). The Eleventh Circuit correctly refused to allow \npolicy preference or purpose\u2014even purpose as most \nnarrowly defined\u2014to negate the plain language of the \nstatute.  \nARGUMENT \nThe question presented, as inaccurately framed \nby Petitioner, asks under the ADA, \u201cdoes a former \nemployee\u2014who was qualified to perform her job and \nwho \nearned \npost-employment \nbenefits \nwhile \nemployed\u2014lose her right to sue over discrimination \nwith respect to those benefits solely because she no \nlonger holds her job?\u201d Pet. Br. i. A former employee \nwho has a \u201cright to sue\u201d cannot \u201close\u201d that right \n\u201csolely\u201d because she no longer holds her job. If so, there \ncould be no ADA claim for a discriminatory \ntermination\u2014a claim the Eleventh Circuit has \npermitted former employees to bring. See Taylor v. \nFood World, Inc., 133 F.3d 1419 (11th Cir. 1998).  \nThe Eleventh Circuit held that to \u201cfall within Title \nI\u2019s anti-discrimination provision, a plaintiff\u2019s claim \nmust depend on an act committed by the defendant \nwhile the plaintiff was either working for the \ndefendant or seeking to work for the defendant.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 8a-9a. This holding clearly makes room for \nformer employees to sue if they were discriminated \nagainst during their employment. Because the \nEleventh Circuit did not hold that former employees \nare categorically barred from suing under the ADA, \nPetitioner is not entitled to a reversal based on a \nruling that was never made.  \n\n14 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nThe \ncircuit-split \nquestion \nis \nwhether \ndiscrimination occurring entirely post-employment \nagainst \ntotally \ndisabled \nformer \nemployees, \nis \nactionable under Title I. The Eleventh Circuit, siding \nwith the majority, held that \u201c[b]ecause Stanley cannot \nestablish that the City committed any discriminatory \nacts against her while she could perform the essential \nfunctions of a job that she held or desired to hold, her \nTitle I claim fails.\u201d Pet. App. 18a.  \nTherefore, Part I of Petitioner\u2019s brief framing the \nissue as whether \u201c[t]he ADA permits former \nemployees to bring suit with respect to post-\nemployment benefits,\u201d attacks a strawman. Pet. Br. \n17. As the Eleventh Circuit never categorically barred \nsuch suits, Petitioner reveals the real alleged errors \nfor this Court\u2019s review deep into Part I(C)(2). Id. 24-\n27. In doing so, she has \u201csmuggl[ed] additional \nquestions into\u201d the case \u201cafter [this Court] grant[ed] \ncertiorari.\u201d Irvine v. People of California, 347 U.S. 128, \n129 (1954).  \nCompletely unrelated to the circuit-split question \nregarding whether post-employment discrimination \nagainst former employees is actionable under Title I, \nPetitioner argues the Eleventh Circuit erred by: (1) \nfinding that she disclaimed standing to sue for \ndiscrimination occurring during her employment, Pet. \nBr. 24, 27; (2) misapplying Title I\u2019s \u201cdisability\u201d \nelement to the facts of this case, Id. 25; and (3) not \napplying the Ledbetter Act to find her time-barred \nclaims allegedly accruing during employment \u201cre-\naccrued in 2020,\u201d Id. 24.  \nNone \nof \nthese \nquestions \nare \n\u201csubsidiary \nquestion[s] fairly included\u201d in the circuit-split \n\n15 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nquestion. Yee v. City of Escondido, Cal., 503 U.S. 519, \n535 (1992). Instead, Petitioner has relegated the \ncircuit-split question to her secondary argument for \nreversal. Pet. Br., Part II, 27. Remarkably, she argues \nthat this Court \u201cneed not even reach\u201d the circuit-split \nquestion and should reverse based solely on the above \nthree alleged misapplications of law to fact. Pet. Br. \n17. This is backwards. This Court should ignore Part \nI and proceed solely to resolving the circuit-split \nquestion in Part II. But to the extent this Court \nreviews Part I, it should find that she waived these \narguments, and any claim of discrimination during \nemployment is unpled and time-barred. \nI. \nThe Non-Circuit-Split Questions Regarding \nDiscrimination During Employment \nIn support of her argument of discrimination \nduring employment when she was a \u201cqualified \nindividual,\u201d Petitioner provides a truncated version of \nTitle I\u2019s enforcement and substantive provisions \nomitting crucial elements under \u00a7 12112(a). Pet. Br. \n17-23. She argues merely pleading that she was \n\u201caggrieved\u201d regarding her post-employment benefits, \nwith the aid of the Ledbetter Act, brings her \u201cclaim \nacross the finish line.\u201d Pet. Br. 21.  \nHer claim, however, never got off the starting \nblocks because she expressly disclaimed standing to \nsue for anything occurring during her employment. \nPet. C.A. Br. 22. To be sure, her initial brief in the \nEleventh Circuit argued: \nMs. Stanley could not have brought these \nclaims while she was still employed and able \nto do her job because she had not yet learned \n\n16 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nof the discrimination and become a disability \nretiree impacted by the discrimination so she \nwould have lacked standing. \nId. (emphasis added). Even in the absence of this \ndisclaimer, her complaint failed to demonstrate that a \nTitle I claim accrued during her employment or that \nany such claim was timely. Determining the \ntimeliness of Petitioner\u2019s 2019 EEOC charge required \nher \u201cto identify precisely the \u2018unlawful employment \npractice\u2019 of which\u201d she complains. Delaware State Coll. \nv. Ricks, 449 U.S. 250, 257 (1980).  \nPetitioner argues her claims accrued during her \nemployment: (1) in 2003 when the City adopted its \nsubsidy policy; (2) when she became disabled during \nemployment; and (3) at some unspecified time when it \nbecame \u201cinevitable\u201d that she would need to take a \ndisability retirement prior to her retirement on \nNovember 1, 2018. Pet. Br. 24-26. These arguments \ncannot be squared with the allegations of the \ncomplaint. And Petitioner has waived them.  \nA. Petitioner disclaimed and her complaint \nfailed to demonstrate any claim accrued \nin 2003 when the City adopted its \nsubsidy policy.  \n1. \nThe \nEleventh \nCircuit \nfound \nPetitioner \n\u201cconcedes, and we agree, that her claim cannot turn on \nthe 2003 amendment to the benefits plan because she \nwas not yet disabled at that time.\u201d Pet. App. 16a. \nPetitioner admitted in her initial brief that the City \nadopted its subsidy policy \u201cin 2003, when Ms. Stanley \nwas a non-disabled employee.\u201d Pet. C.A. Br. 22 n. 5. \nShe then conceded she \u201clacked standing\u201d to bring \n\n17 \n\u0003\n\u0003\n\u201cthese claims while she was still employed and able to \ndo her job\u201d because she was not yet a \u201cdisability retiree \nimpacted by the discrimination.\u201d Pet. C.A. Br. 22 \n(emphasis added). Although Petitioner purported to \nincorporate the United States\u2019 contrary arguments \ninto her initial brief, Pet. C.A. Br. 20, the Eleventh \nCircuit was not required to scour the amicus brief for \nbetter arguments to save Petitioner\u2019s case. The \nEleventh Circuit properly relied on her arguments in \nher brief expressly disclaiming standing to sue for \nanything during her employment.  \nPetitioner and the United States attempt to \nexplain away her concessions by arguing she only \nmeant to disclaim any financial impact during her \nemployment. Pet. Br. 27; U.S. Am. Br. 27-28. This \nargument cannot be squared with her clear concession \nthat she \u201clacked standing\u201d to sue \u201cwhile she was still \nemployed.\u201d Pet. C.A. Br. 22. Indeed, financial impact \nis not necessary for standing, but an injury is. Her way \nof describing \u201cinjury\u201d was by using the word \u201cimpact\u201d \nbecause otherwise she would not have disclaimed \nstanding simply because she suffered no financial \nimpact during employment.  \nIt is true that this Court\u2019s \u201cpractice \u2018permit[s] \nreview of an issue not pressed [below] so long as it has \nbeen passed upon.\u2019\u201d Citizens United v. Fed. Election \nComm'n, 558 U.S. 310, 330 (2010). To the extent that \nthe Eleventh Circuit passed upon this issue by \n\u201cagree[ing]\u201d with Petitioner's concession that \u201cher \nclaim cannot turn on the 2003\u201d adoption of the policy, \nPet. App. 16a, prudential concerns weigh in favor of \nthis Court declining to review this matter. A mere \nfailure to \u201cpress\u201d an argument is markedly different \n\n18 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nthan an express disclaimer of an argument because \nthe latter invites the complained-of error. See City of \nSpringfield, Mass. v. Kibbe, 480 U.S. 257, 259 \n(1987) (rejecting argument \u201cthat we need not concern \nourselves about Springfield's failure to preserve this \nissue, because it was passed on by the Court of \nAppeals\u201d because \u201cthere would be considerable \nprudential objection to reversing a judgment because \nof instructions that petitioner accepted, and indeed \nitself requested.\u201d).  \nFurther, while an appellant can raise on appeal \nany new \u201cargument\u201d in support of a \u201cclaim,\u201d U.S. \nAmicus Br. 28 n. 6, it cannot wait until its reply brief \nto flip-flop on a position in true ambush fashion as \nPetitioner did here. Compare Pet. C.A. Br. 22 with Pet. \nC.A. Reply Br. 5. This Court should hold that because \nPetitioner \u201craised this issue for the first time in [her] \nreply \nbrief,\u201d \nshe \n\u201chas \nwaived \nthis \nclaim.\u201d \nUnited States v. Dicter, 198 F.3d 1284, 1289 (11th Cir. \n1999). \n2. Even if Petitioner hadn\u2019t expressly disclaimed \nthe argument below, her allegations were still \ninsufficient to demonstrate that a claim accrued in \n2003. Although she concedes she was not disabled \nthen, she incorrectly argues she was not required to \nhave a disability at that time to bring suit. Pet. Br. 25.  \nTitle I\u2019s enforcement provision, \u00a7 12117(a), \nincorporates Title VII\u2019s remedial framework which \nstates any \u201cperson claiming to be aggrieved\u201d can bring \n\u201ca civil action.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1). This Court \nhas held that \u201caggrieved\u201d in Title VII \u201cenabl[es] suit \nby any plaintiff with an interest arguably [sought] to \nbe protected by the statute...while excluding plaintiffs \n\n19 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nwho might technically be injured in an Article III \nsense but whose interests are unrelated to the \nstatutory prohibitions in Title VII.\u201d Thompson v. N. \nAm. Stainless, LP, 562 U.S. 170, 178 (2011) (internal \nquotation \nmarks \nand \ncitation \nomitted). \nPut \ndifferently, the requirement that the plaintiff be \n\u201caggrieved\u201d is a requirement that the plaintiff have \n\u201cstatutory\u201d standing to sue. Id. at 177-78. \nBut, here, Petitioner failed to allege Article III or \nstatutory standing to sue in 2003. Her claim is based \non \u201cher disability.\u201d Doc. 1, \u00b6 26. And yet, she was not \ndisabled in 2003 and therefore not injured by a policy \nthat allegedly discriminated only against the disabled. \nSee Bostock v. Clayton Cnty., Georgia, 590 U.S. 644, \n681 \n(2020) \n(\u201cDiscriminate \nagainst\u201d \nmeans \n\u201cdistinctions or differences in treatment that injure \nprotected individuals.\u201d).  \nHer claim was not based on the disability of \nsomeone else with whom she associated under \u00a7 \n12112(b)(4), nor was it based on a claim that she was \nmerely \u201cregarded as\u201d disabled under \u00a7 12102(1)(C). \nSee Murray v. Warren Pumps, LLC, 821 F.3d 77, 83 \n(1st Cir. 2016) (a plaintiff must prove her \u201cparticular \ntheory of disability discrimination alleged.\u201d). Based on \nPetitioner\u2019s particular theory in her complaint, she \nwas required to show that she was discriminated \nagainst because of her disability \u201cwhich requires that \nthe disability exist at the time of the discrimination.\u201d \nWeyer, 198 F.3d at 1112.  \nPetitioner argues that the ADAAA of 2008 \nrepealed any requirement that she have a disability to \nsue for a claim allegedly accruing in 2003. Pet. Br. 25. \nThe ADAAA amended \u00a7 12112(a) to prohibit \n\n20 \n\u0003\n\u0003\ndiscrimination \u201cagainst a qualified individual on the \nbasis of disability\u201d rather than \u201cagainst a qualified \nindividual with a disability because of the disability.\u201d \nPub. L. No. 110-325, \u00a7 5(a)(1), 122 Stat. 3557 (2008) \n(emphasis added). However, the Eleventh Circuit and \nits \u201csister circuits...hold that the switch from \u2018because \nof\u2019 to \u2018on the basis of\u2019 in the 2008 amendment to the \nADA did not change or affect its but-for causation \nstandard.\u201d Akridge v. Alfa Ins. Companies, 93 F.4th \n1181, 1192 (11th Cir. 2024). \nThis \namendment \nremoved \nthe \nredundant \nlanguage, \u201cwith a disability because of the disability\u201d \nfrom \u00a7 12112(a) because those words were already \nrepeated several times in the \u201cconstruction\u201d provision, \n\u00a7 12112(b). Section 12112(b)(1), for example, still \nprohibits \n\u201cclassifying \na \njob \napplicant \nor \nemployee...because of the disability of such applicant \nor employee.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(1) (emphasis \nadded). \nThe express purpose of the ADAAA was to \u201creject\u201d \ndecisions of this Court, which Congress found \ninterpreted the definition of a \u201cdisability\u201d too \nnarrowly. Pub. L. No. 110-325, \u00a7 2(b). Congress stated \nthe amendment\u2019s purpose was to clarify \u201cthat the \nquestion of whether an individual's impairment is a \ndisability under the ADA should not demand \nextensive analysis.\u201d Id. at \u00a7 2(b)(5). Therefore, the \nchanges removed the prior emphasis on whether an \nindividual\u2019s impairment met the definition of a \n\u201cdisability.\u201d Congress did not remove the requirement \nthat an individual have a disability all together. \n3. Even if the ADAAA did dispense with the \n\u201cdisability\u201d element, the United States acknowledges \n\n21 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nthat the \u201cADAAA\u2019s amendments...apply to claims that \narose after\u201d January 1, 2009. U.S. Amicus Br. 24 n. 4. \nTherefore, any claim allegedly accruing in 2003 would \nbe governed by the ADA, before the ADAAA allegedly \ndisposed of the disability element.  \n4. Petitioner makes a last-ditch effort to root her \nclaim in 2003 when she was a \u201cqualified individual\u201d by \narguing this Court may \u201cconceive of this claim as \nencompassing two moments of time that complete the \nwhole: when the facially discriminatory policy was \nadopted in 2003, and when Lt. Stanley became \ndisabled.\u201d Pet. Br. 26. However, this Court has \nrecognized that Title VII claims can encompass \ndifferent events at different points in time only in two \nnarrow circumstances: hostile work environment \nclaims and constructive discharge claims. Green v. \nBrennan, 578 U.S. 547, 556-57 (2016). Moreover, \nPetitioner has expressly waived any argument of \ndiscrimination at any time during her employment. \nPet. C.A. Br. 22.  \nB. Petitioner disclaimed and her complaint \nfailed to demonstrate a claim accrued at \nany time between her diagnosis and \nretirement.  \n1. The Eleventh Circuit expressly declined to pass \nupon Petitioner\u2019s untimely argument raised in her \nreply brief that a claim accrued \u201cat some unknown \npoint before she retired but after she was diagnosed \nwith Parkinson\u2019s.\u201d Pet. App. 17a. This Court should \ndecline to \u201cdecide in the first instance issues not \ndecided below.\u201d Reagan Nat'l Advert. of Austin, LLC, \n596 U.S. at 76.  \n\n22 \n\u0003\n\u0003\n2. But if this Court proceeds, it must determine \nwhether the complaint alleged that Petitioner was a \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d with a disability during her \nemployment. She must allege that she became \ndisabled \u201cduring the course of [her] employment but \nnevertheless continued to perform the essential \nrequirements of [her] job with or without a reasonable \naccommodation, until [she] became completely and \ntotally disabled.\u201d Bass v. City of Orlando, 57 F. Supp. \n2d 1318, 1323 (M.D. Fla. 1999), aff'd, 203 F.3d 841 \n(11th Cir. 1999). Contrary to the United States\u2019 \nclaims, Petitioner\u2019s complaint does not allege when or \nhow she became disabled, let alone that she continued \nto work thereafter. U.S. Amicus Br. 26. Petitioner only \nalleged that because of a \u201cphysical disability\u201d she took \na disability retirement in 2018 and as a result would \nlose the subsidy in 2020. Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 16, 26.  \nAlthough we now have the benefit of the summary \njudgment record on her Equal Protection claim, in \ntesting the sufficiency of a complaint, a district court \ndoes not \u201cassume that the [plaintiff] can prove facts \nthat it has not alleged or that the defendants have \nviolated...laws in ways that have not been alleged.\u201d \nAssociated Gen. Contractors of California, Inc. v. \nCalifornia State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, \n526 (1983); see also Aldana v. Del Monte Fresh \nProduce, N.A., Inc., 416 F.3d 1242, 1248 (11th Cir. \n2005) (a plaintiff must \u201callege sufficient facts to \nwarrant [a particular] inference\u201d). \nPetitioner led the district court to its conclusion \nwhen she failed to dispute the City\u2019s argument for \ndismissal that she only alleged post-employment \ndiscrimination when she was no longer a \u201cqualified \n\n23 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nindividual.\u201d Doc. 14 at 4-5; Doc. 17. Instead, she \nmerely argued that the district court should refuse to \nfollow Eleventh Circuit precedent in Gonzales (a case \ninvolving only post-employment discrimination). Doc. \n17 at 5-6. As the Eleventh Circuit noted, she did not \nattempt to distinguish the facts of Gonzales from her \ncase by arguing that she alleged discrimination during \nemployment. Pet. App. 18a. The district court, thus, \nproperly dismissed her ADA claim because her \ncomplaint \u201calleged [the] discrimination did not occur \nuntil Plaintiff was no longer able to perform the \nessential functions of her job.\u201d Doc. 27 at 7. \nFurther, the district court was \u201cnot required to \ngrant\u2026plaintiff leave to amend [her] complaint sua \nsponte when the plaintiff, who is represented by \ncounsel, never filed a motion to amend nor requested \nleave to amend before the district court.\u201d Wagner v. \nDaewoo Heavy Indus. Am. Corp., 314 F.3d 541, 542 \n(11th Cir. 2002). After dismissal, Petitioner did not \nmove \nfor \nreconsideration \narguing \nthe \ncourt \nmisapprehended her complaint allegedly pleading \ndiscrimination during employment. Perhaps fearing \nher claims would be time-barred, she never argued \nthey arose during her employment, years before she \nfiled her 2019 EEOC charge. Indeed, she never \nmentioned the generous accrual provisions of the \nLedbetter Act in the district court. Doc. 1, \u00b6 6.  \nPetitioner\u2019s initial brief in the Eleventh Circuit \nconfirmed that her complaint only alleged post-\nemployment discrimination because she argued she \n\u201ccould not have brought these claims while she was \nstill employed\u201d because \u201cshe would have lacked \nstanding.\u201d Pet. C.A. Br. 22. The Eleventh Circuit \n\n24 \n\u0003\n\u0003\ntherefore properly refused to pass upon this issue \nexpressly disclaimed in her initial brief and untimely \ncontradicted in her reply brief. Pet. App. 17a. This \nCourt should decline to decide this unpreserved issue \nin the first instance, and as demonstrated above, it is \nunsupported by her allegations.  \nC. The Ledbetter Act\u2019s generous accrual \nprovisions do not create a claim where \nnone exists. \nIt is clear that if a claim accrued in 2003, it \nexpired long before Petitioner filed her EEOC charge \nin 2019. Doc. 1, \u00b6 6. Petitioner argues that under the \nLedbetter Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e5(e)(3)(A), her 2003 \nclaim \u201cre-accrued in 2020\u201d when she \u201cwas \u2018affected\u2019 \nwhen her subsidy ended.\u201d Pet. Br. 24, 26 n. 1. The \nLedbetter Act has no place here.  \n\u201cOrdinarily, a limitations period commences \nwhen the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of \naction.\u201d Green v. Brennan, 578 U.S. 547, 554 (2016) \n(cleaned up). \u201c[A] cause of action does not become \n\u2018complete and present\u2019 for limitations purposes until \nthe plaintiff can file suit and obtain relief.\u201d Id. (cleaned \nup). Petitioner failed to demonstrate she had a \n\u201ccomplete and present\u201d claim during her employment.  \nIndeed, \nany \nclaim \nof \ndisability-based \ndiscrimination in 2003 when she was not disabled \nwould have been dismissed for lack of standing, as she \nconceded below but refuses to admit now. Pet. Br. C.A. \n22. If no claim accrued in 2003, it could not \u201cre-accrue\u201d \npost-employment. \u201cA plaintiff must plead and prove \nthe elements of a pay-discrimination claim to benefit \nfrom the Ledbetter Act's accrual provisions.\u201d Davis v. \n\n25 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nBombardier Transp. Holdings (USA) Inc., 794 F.3d \n266, 269 (2d Cir. 2015); see also AT & T Corp. v. \nHulteen, 556 U.S. 701, 716 (2009) (Ledbetter Act did \nnot save the plaintiff\u2019s untimely claim because the \noriginal \nemployment \npractice \n\u201cwas \nnot \ndiscriminatory\u201d). The Ledbetter Act \u201cis an accrual \nrule; it does not affect the substance of the claim.\u201d \nMcReynolds v. Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc., 694 F.3d 873, \n888 (7th Cir. 2012). Therefore, the Eleventh Circuit \ncorrectly held the Ledbetter Act\u2019s \u201crelaxed statute of \nlimitations helps a plaintiff only if that plaintiff \notherwise has a claim for discrimination.\u201d Pet. App. \n15a. \nThe Eleventh Circuit did not pass upon whether \nthe Ledbetter Act should apply to allow a Title I claim \nto \u201cre-accrue\u201d when an individual is \u201caffected\u201d post-\nemployment when she is no longer qualified. This \nCourt should decline to decide this issue in the first \ninstance. This is especially so where Petitioner has not \nshown that the facts of Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & \nRubber Co., 550 U.S. 618 (2007), which prompted the \nLedbetter Act, are sufficiently similar to the subject \nfacts to warrant extension of the Act here. Unlike the \nsecret decisions creating an unknown pay disparity for \nMs. Ledbetter, the City\u2019s subsidy policy was a publicly \nannounced act codified in its ordinances and \u201cofficial \npersonnel policies.\u201d Doc. 1, \u00b6 24; see also Doc. 38-10 at \n2-5; Doc. 38-11 at 4. Such fully communicated acts can \nbe vindicated \u201cwithout the need for the Ledbetter Act's \ngenerous accrual provisions because the employee had \nnotice of the pay reduction.\u201d Davis, 794 F.3d at 271.  \nPetitioner\u2019s later testimony claiming ignorance of \nthe ordinance is irrelevant. See Taylor v. Michael, 724 \n\n26 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nF.3d 806, 811 (7th Cir.2013) (\u201cLack of familiarity with \nthe law...is not a circumstance that justifies equitable \ntolling.\u201d). Therefore, the City\u2019s policy is akin to the \nemployment practice at issue in Ricks, not Ledbetter. \nIn Ricks, \u201cthe only alleged discrimination occurred\u2013\nand \nthe \nfiling \nlimitations \nperiods \ntherefore \ncommenced\u2013at the time the tenure decision was made \nand communicated to Ricks.\u201d 449 U.S. at 258. \u201cThat is \nso even though one of the effects of the denial of \ntenure\u2013the eventual loss of a teaching position\u2013did \nnot occur until later.\u201d Id. For such acts, \u201cthe clock \nstarts running when the plaintiff first knew or should \nhave known of his injury, whether or not he realized \nthe cause of his injury was unlawful.\u201d Almond, 665 \nF.3d at 1176.  \nTo extend the Ledbetter Act under the facts of this \ncase would open the floodgates to stale claims over \nknown, written personnel policies and publicly \nannounced ordinances. And it would allow plaintiffs to \ndelay suit indefinitely, despite knowing exactly when \na benefit will end, by arguing that the claim \u201cre-\naccrues\u201d every month that the plaintiff does not \nreceive the benefit. See, e.g., Lohrasbi v. Bd. of \nTrustees of the Univ. of Illinois, 147 F. Supp. 3d 746, \n755 (C.D. Ill. 2015) (\u201c[T]he 300-day time-limit does not \nrestart each day that Plaintiff is deprived of Professor \nEmiritus status.\u201d). The Ledbetter Act has no place \nhere and any claims that allegedly accrued during \nPetitioner\u2019s employment have long-since expired and \nbeen waived.    \n\n27 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nII. The \nCircuit \nSplit \nQuestion \nRegarding \nDiscrimination Post-Employment \nThis Court should only resolve the question \nsplitting the circuit courts: whether totally disabled \nretirees are \u201cqualified individuals\u201d entitled to seek \nrelief under Title I for discrimination occurring \nentirely post-employment. The Eleventh Circuit below \n(at Pet. App. 11a-12a) and \u201cthe majority of courts have \nheld, Title I is unambiguous; by its plain language, it \ndoes not\u201d prohibit discrimination against \u201cformer \nemployees who are unable to perform the essential \nfunctions of their jobs.\u201d McKnight v. Gen. Motors \nCorp., 550 F.3d 519, 528 (6th Cir. 2008); Morgan v. \nJoint Admin. Bd., 268 F.3d 456, 458\u201359 (7th Cir. \n2001); Weyer v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp., 198 \nF.3d 1104, 1112 (9th Cir. 2000).   \nOnly two circuits have disagreed and held that \nTitle I is ambiguous because it allegedly fails to \n\u201cspecify when a potential plaintiff must have been a \n\u2018qualified individual\u2019...\u201d Castellano v. City of New York, \n142 F.3d 58, 67 (2d Cir. 1998) (emphasis in original); \nFord v. Schering-Plough Corp., 145 F.3d 601, 606 (3d \nCir. 1998). The Third Circuit also found an ambiguity, \nnot in the text, but in the \u201cdisjunction between the \nADA\u2019s definition of \u2018qualified individual with a \ndisability\u2019 and the rights that the ADA confers.\u201d Ford, \n145 F.3d at 605. \nAs \nthe \nEleventh \nCircuit \nexplained \nbelow \n\u201c[n]either court established that the text of Title I\u2019s \nanti-discrimination provision is ambiguous.\u201d Pet. App. \n12a. \u201cInstead, the Second and the Third Circuit \nexpressed \nsomething \nbetween \ndiscomfort \nand \ndisagreement with the policy choice underlying the \n\n28 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nline, drawn by the text of the ADA, between disabled \nindividuals who hold or desire to hold a job and those \nwho do not.\u201d Pet. App. 12a. \u201cBut not \u2018even the most \nformidable policy arguments\u2019 empower a court to \nignore unambiguous text.\u201d Id. (citation omitted). And \nthat text plainly prohibits discrimination solely \nagainst individuals who \u201ccan perform the essential \nfunctions\u201d of the job \u201cthat such individual holds or \ndesires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12111(8), 12112(a). \nA. Title I requires an individual to hold or \ndesire \na \njob \nat \nthe \ntime \nof \nthe \ndiscriminatory act to be a \u201cqualified \nindividual.\u201d \nThe first step \u201cin interpreting a statute is to \ndetermine whether the language at issue has a plain \nand unambiguous meaning with regard to the \nparticular dispute in the case.\u201d Robinson v. Shell Oil \nCo., 519 U.S. 337, 340 (1997). \u201cThe plainness or \nambiguity of statutory language is determined by \nreference to the language itself, the specific context in \nwhich that language is used, and the broader context \nof the statute as a whole.\u201d Id. at 341. \n1. \nThe text uses the present tense as a \ntemporal \nqualifier \nto \nprohibit \ndiscrimination solely against an \nindividual who \u201ccan perform\u201d the \njob she presently \u201cholds or desires.\u201d      \na. Title I\u2019s anti-discrimination provision (the \n\u201cgeneral rule\u201d) and its incorporated definition of a \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d are unambiguous. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 \n12112(a), 12111(8). The \u201cgeneral rule\u201d makes it \nunlawful for an employer to \u201cdiscriminate against a \n\n29 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nqualified individual on the basis of disability in regard \nto \njob \napplication \nprocedures, \nthe \nhiring, \nadvancement, or discharge of employees, employee \ncompensation, \njob \ntraining, \nand \nother \nterms, \nconditions, and privileges of employment.\u201d Id. \u00a7 \n12112(a).  \nSection 12111(8) defines a \u201cqualified individual\u201d \nas \u201can individual who, with or without reasonable \naccommodation, can perform the essential functions of \nthe employment position that such individual holds or \ndesires.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12111(8). Because the general rule \nexpressly incorporates the definition of a \u201cqualified \nindividual,\u201d an \u201cADA plaintiff bears the burden of \nproving that she is...a person \u2018who, with or without \nreasonable accommodation, can perform the essential \nfunctions\u2019 of her job,\u201d Cleveland v. Policy Mgmt. Sys. \nCorp., 526 U.S. 795, 806 (1999), at the time of the \nprohibited discrimination. (emphasis added).  \n\u201cCongress\u2019 use of a verb tense is significant in \nconstruing statutes.\u201d United States v. Wilson, 503 U.S. \n329, 333 (1992). For example, the ADA\u2019s use of \u201cthe \npresent indicative verb form\u201d requires \u201cthat a person \nbe presently\u2026substantially limited in order to \ndemonstrate a disability.\u201d Sutton v. United Air Lines, \nInc., 527 U.S. 471, 482 (1999), superseded, in part, on \nother grounds, ADAAA of 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-325, \u00a7 \n2(b)(3) (emphasis added); Dictionary Act, 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 \n(\u201cIn determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, \nunless the context indicates otherwise...words used in \nthe present tense include the future as well as the \npresent\u201d\u2014not the past). \nSection 12112(a) does not prohibit discrimination \nagainst an individual who performed the job that such \n\n30 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nindividual held or desired. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12112(a), \n12111(8). The present tense is used to require that an \nindividual be able to perform her job at the time of the \ndiscrimination.  \nThis is not to say that a former employee can \nnever sue under Title I. The Eleventh Circuit held she \nmay sue if her claim is based \u201con an act committed by \nthe defendant while the plaintiff was either working \nfor the defendant or seeking to work for the \ndefendant.\u201d Pet. App. 8a-9a. This is because the \ngeneral rule does not require a former employee to be \na \u201cqualified individual\u201d at the time of the lawsuit. See \nid. \u00a7 12112(a). Its focus is on the individual\u2019s \nqualifications at the time of the discriminatory act \nbecause it speaks only in terms of the prohibited \ndiscrimination\u2014not when suit is filed. Id. Any \nmischaracterization of the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s holding \nto categorically exclude retirees from suing under \nTitle I, must be rejected. It correctly held that \n\u201c[b]ecause Stanley cannot establish that the City \ncommitted any discriminatory acts against her while \nshe could perform the essential functions of a job that \nshe held or desired to hold, her Title I claim fails.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 18a.  \nb. This Court\u2019s decision in Robinson reinforces the \nsignificance of present tense verbs as \u201ctemporal \nqualifiers\u201d to limit the scope of a statute\u2019s protection \nto current employees. 519 U.S. at 341-42 & n. 2. The \nquestion in Robinson was whether the word \n\u201cemployees\u201d in Title VII\u2019s anti-retaliation provision, \u00a7 \n704(a), includes former employees. Id. at 339. Section \n704(a) makes it unlawful \u201cfor an employer to \ndiscriminate against any of his employees or \n\n31 \n\u0003\n\u0003\napplicants for employment\u201d who have availed \nthemselves of Title VII\u2019s protections or assisted others \nin so doing. Id. Section 701(f) defines \u201cemployee\u201d as \n\u201can individual employed by an employer.\u201d Id. at 342 \n(emphasis added).  \nThis Court explained that certain features of \u00a7 \n704(a) made it ambiguous and militated in favor of \nreading it to include former employees. Id. at 341. \nFirst, this Court emphasized that \u201cthere is no \ntemporal qualifier\u201d in \u00a7 704(a). Id. Second, the \ndefinition of \u201cemployees\u201d in \u00a7 701(f) was consistent \nwith either current or past employment because the \nword \u201cemployed\u201d used therein could mean \u201cis \nemployed\u201d or \u201cwas employed.\u201d Id. at 342 (emphasis in \noriginal). Thus, this Court concluded that like \u00a7 \n704(a), the definition of \u201cemployees\u201d in \u00a7 701(f) \u201clacks \nany temporal qualifier.\u201d Id.  \nOn this critical \u201ctemporal qualifier\u201d point, this \nCourt distinguished its decision just one month earlier \nin Walters v. Metro. Educational Enters., 519 U.S. 202 \n(1997). Id. at 341 n. 2. In Walters, this Court \nunanimously held that \u201cemployees\u201d as used in \u00a7 701(b) \nrelating to the 15-employee threshold for coverage by \nTitle \nVII, \nunambiguously \nreferred \nto \ncurrent \nemployees only. 519 U.S. at 341, n.2. This was because \n\u00a7 701(b) clearly included \u201ctwo significant temporal \nqualifiers.\u201d Id. This Court noted \u00a7 701(b)\u2019s language \nstating that Title VII \u201capplies to any employer \u2018who \nhas fifteen or more employees for each working day\u2026\u2019\u201d \nId. (emphasis in original). \u201cThe emphasized words \nspecify the time frame in which the employment \nrelationship must exist, and thus the specific context \nof that section did not present the particular \n\n32 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nambiguity at issue in the present case.\u201d Id. Indeed, \u00a7 \n701(b)\u2019s use of the present-tense as a temporal \nqualifier was critical in distinguishing the facts of \nRobinson. \nThe majority of courts have thus correctly \nconcluded that \u201cTitle I, unlike the section of Title VII \nat issue in Robinson, has a \u2018temporal qualifier.\u2019\u201d \nWeyer, 198 F.3d at 1112. Because \u00a7 12111(8) \u201cuses the \npresent tense...one must be able to perform the \nessential functions of employment at the time that one \nis discriminated against.\u201d Id. Section 12111(8)\u2019s other \ntemporal qualifiers reinforce this conclusion. It also \nrefers in the present tense to \u201cthe employment \nposition that such individual holds or desires.\u201d 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8) (emphasis added). The ADA, \ntherefore, has more in common with the provision that \nthis Court limited to current employees in Walters \nthan to the anti-retaliation provision distinguished in \nRobinson.  \n2. \nThe \nspecific \ncontext \nin \nwhich \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d is used within \nthe anti-discrimination provision \nshows \nthat \nit \nprohibits \ndiscrimination solely against those \nwho presently hold or desire jobs.    \nAfter examining the language itself, we next look \nto the \u201cspecific context in which that language is used\u201d \nto discern its meaning. Robinson, 519 U.S. at 341. The \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition is used within the \nanti-discrimination provision. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12112(a), \n12111(8). Petitioner\u2019s incorrect interpretation of Title \nI derives from her narrow focus on the \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d definition completely out of context from \n\n33 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nthe general rule where the definition appears. A \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d means an individual who \u201ccan \nperform the essential functions\u201d of the job she \u201cholds \nor desires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8). Petitioner argues \nthat the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of the \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d definition is to protect employers from \nbeing compelled to hire or retain unqualified \nindividuals by \u201ctesting\u201d an employee's capabilities. \nPet. Br. 34. And so, she argues if an individual has no \njob, an employer has no interest in the individual\u2019s \nability to perform and thus the \u201ccan perform\u201d clause \ncan be ignored. Id. 24, 34-35.  \nThis argument barely holds water when the \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition is read in a vacuum. \nIt completely fails when the definition is read within \nthe general rule where it appears. Indeed, \u201c[t]he \nquestion isn\u2019t just what [qualified individual] mean[s], \nbut what [Title I] says about it.\u201d Bostock, 590 U.S. at \n656. Read in context, the general rule prohibits \ndiscrimination solely against an individual who can \nperform the job she holds or desires. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n12111(8), 12112(a).  \nAnd so, the primary purpose of this anti-\ndiscrimination rule is not to protect the hiring \nprerogatives of employers, but to protect certain \ndisabled individuals from discrimination: those who \npresently work, want to work and can work despite \ntheir disabilities. See Tyndall v. Nat'l Educ. Centers, \nInc. of California, 31 F.3d 209, 215 (4th Cir. 1994) \n(\u201c[T]he primary purpose of the ADA...[is] to encourage \nemployers to take on qualified individuals, regardless \nof their disability.\u201d). Title I was intended to \u201cdraw \nworkers with a disability into the workforce.\u201d Morgan, \n\n34 \n\u0003\n\u0003\n268 F.3d at 458 (emphasis added). Its \u201clanguage [is] \nwell designed to help people get and keep jobs, not to \nhelp those no longer able to work get disability pay.\u201d \nWeyer, 198 F.3d at 1112; see also Pet. App. 8a (the \nADA\u2019s \u201ccentral purpose\u201d is \u201cprotecting disabled people \nwho can nevertheless perform the essential functions \nof a job\u201d). Indeed, drawing the disabled into the \nworkforce would save \u201cthe United States billions of \ndollars in unnecessary expenses resulting from \ndependency and nonproductivity.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n12101(8) (emphasis added).  \nThus, \nthe \nprimary \npurpose \nof \nthe \nanti-\ndiscrimination rule is to prohibit employers from \ndiscriminating \nagainst \ncurrent \nemployees \nand \napplicants who can work despite their disabilities\u2014\nnot to impose a \u201ctest\u201d on employees that they either \n\u201cpass,\u201d \u201cfail,\u201d or in the case of retirees, are allegedly \nexempt from taking. See Pet. Br. 34. By interpreting \nthe definition of a \u201cqualified individual\u201d in a vacuum, \nPetitioner commits the same error as the Second \nCircuit \ndid \nin \nCastellano. \nThere, \ndespite \nacknowledging that it must consider \u201cthe specific \ncontext in which that language is used,\u201d the court \nskipped that step, isolated the definition, and \nconcluded that it failed \u201cto specify when a potential \nplaintiff must have been a \u2018qualified individual with a \ndisability\u2019...\u201d 142 F.3d at 67 (emphasis in original). It \nthen \u201cmanufactured ambiguity where none existed.\u201d \nMcKnight, 550 F.3d at 527.  \nHad the Castellano court read the definition in \ncontext as used in the general rule, it would have \nrealized that the statute says exactly when an \nindividual must be qualified. A violation only arises if \n\n35 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nan employer discriminates against a \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d and thus if one is not qualified at the time \nof the discrimination there is no violation and no \nclaim. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a). By focusing on those who \n\u201ccan perform\u201d jobs they \u201chold or desire\u201d Congress \nlimited the statute\u2019s protections to current employees \nand applicants.  \nEven considering the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of the \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition as narrowly defined \nby Petitioner to protect employers from being forced to \nhire or retain unqualified individuals, Petitioner\u2019s \nargument fails. \u201c[E]xcept in the rare case of an obvious \nscrivener\u2019s error, purpose\u2014even purpose as most \nnarrowly defined\u2014cannot be used to contradict text or \nto supplement it.\u201d A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading \nLaw: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 57 (2012) \n(\u201cScalia & Garner\u201d). Petitioner\u2019s argument that the \npurpose of the \u201ccan perform\u201d clause should be deemed \n\u201csatisfied\u201d in the case of retirees is nothing more than \na request for this Court to rewrite the text to include \nan exception to the \u201ccan perform\u201d clause for retirees.  \nAnd regardless of whether an employer is \nconcerned with a retiree\u2019s ability to perform, Congress \nwas concerned solely with protecting those who \u201ccan \nperform.\u201d If an individual is totally disabled or no \nlonger holds or desires their position, the statute is \nsilent as to discrimination against that individual. \nPetitioner presumes, based on nothing, that the \nstatute must say something about retirees who do not \nhold or desire their jobs. But a \u201cjudge should not \npresume that every statute answers every question, \nthe answers to be discovered through interpretation.\u201d \nScalia & Garner, 93.  \n\n36 \n\u0003\n\u0003\n\u201c[T]he limitations of a text\u2014what a text chooses \nnot to do\u2014are as much a part of its \u2018purposes\u2019 as its \naffirmative dispositions.\u201d Id. at 57 (emphasis in \noriginal). These \u201climitations must be respected, and \nthe only way to accord them their due is to reject the \nreplacement or supplementation of text with purpose.\u201d \nId. at 57-58. Title I expressly limits its protections to \nthose who can perform the jobs they hold or desire. \nThere are no exceptions, and this Court should not \nalter the plain language to make any to appease \nPetitioner\u2019s policy preferences.  \n3. \nTitle \nI\u2019s \ndistinction \nbetween \n\u201cqualified \nindividuals\u201d \nand \n\u201cindividuals\u201d \nis \nconsistent \nthroughout the statutory scheme.   \nThe ADA\u2019s \u201cstatutory scheme is coherent and \nconsistent.\u201d Robinson, 519 U.S. at 340. The ADA\u2019s use \nof \u201cqualified individual\u201d does not vary in different \nprovisions. In Robinson, on the other hand, this Court \nfound that the word \u201cemployee\u201d included former \nemployees in at least some provisions of Title VII. Id. \nat 342-43. Having found \u00a7 704(a) ambiguous, this \nCourt considered what interpretation would be most \nconsistent with that section's purpose. In doing so, this \nCourt emphasized that \u00a7 704(a) was an anti-\nretaliation provision that by its nature would be \n\u201ceffectively vitiate[d]\u201d if it were confined to current \nemployees. Id. at 345. However, the ambiguities and \npolicy concerns that drove this Court\u2019s analysis of Title \nVII\u2019s anti-retaliation provision do not exist under Title \nI of the ADA.  \nTitle I does not protect against retaliation. The \nADA prohibits retaliation under Title V. See 42 U.S.C. \n\n37 \n\u0003\n\u0003\n\u00a7 12203(a) (it is unlawful for any employer \u201cto \ndiscriminate against any individual because such \nindividual has opposed any act or practice made \nunlawful by this chapter...\u201d) (emphasis added). Thus, \nthe concerns that impelled this Court to a broad \nconstruction of Title VII\u2019s anti-retaliation provision \nare not present here, because the ADA's anti-\nretaliation provision is expressly drawn to cover \u201cany \nindividual,\u201d not just the narrower subset of \u201cqualified \nindividuals\u201d covered by Title I. See Morgan, 268 F.3d \nat 458 (\u201cThe difference is stark.\u201d). Thus, when \nCongress wanted to prohibit discrimination against \ndisabled former employees, \u201cit did so clearly and \nexplicitly,\u201d Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U.S. 438, \n455 \n(2002), \nby \nreferring \nto \n\u201cindividuals\u201d\u2014not \n\u201cqualified individuals.\u201d \nB. Petitioner\u2019s contrary arguments lack \nmerit. \nAs described above, the Second and Third Circuits \nare the only circuits to side with Petitioner\u2019s \nargument. See supra Castellano and Ford. Recently, \nhowever, the Second Circuit acknowledged that \u201c[i]n \ngeneral, the determination of whether a person is \n\u2018qualified\u2019 should be made at the time of the \ndiscriminatory employment action,\u201d but in Castellano, \nthe court \u201ccreated a narrow exception to the rule for \npost-employment benefits intended to be used by \nretirees.\u201d Smith v. Town of Ramapo, 745 Fed. Appx. \n424, 426 (2d Cir. 2018) (emphasis added). Thus, even \nthe Second Circuit, albeit in an unpublished opinion, \nadmits that Castellano judicially-created a \u201cnarrow \nexception\u201d to the plain text of the rule articulated by \nCongress. Id.  \n\n38 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nPetitioner now rejects the Second and Third \nCircuit\u2019s finding of ambiguity in the \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d definition. She argues their judgments are \ndictated by the plain text of Title I, which she claims \nimposes only a \u201cconditional\u201d mandate that one be able \nto perform their job only if they hold or desire one. Pet. \nBr. 28. Despite this recasting of the argument, \nPetitioner is still guilty of the same cardinal sin of \nstatutory construction committed by the Second and \nThird Circuits. She too rewrites Title I by creating a \n\u201cnarrow exception\u201d to the \u201ccan perform\u201d clause just for \nretirees.  \n1. \nPetitioner\u2019s interpretation of the \nperformance requirement of the \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition as a \n\u201cconditional \nmandate,\u201d \nadds \nan \nunwritten \nexception \nto \nthat \nrequirement for retirees.    \na. The alleged \u201cconditional\u201d nature of the \nperformance requirement of the \u201cqualified individual\u201d \ndefinition cannot be divined from any part of the \nstatutory text. In support of this theory, Petitioner \nresorts to strained and unnatural constructions such \nas retirees are \u201cnot unable to perform the essential \nfunctions of a job that they hold or desire.\u201d Pet. Br. 34. \nShe admits \u201ctesting the job capabilities of someone \nwho is no longer working may seem logically \nawkward.\u201d Id. That is putting it mildly. But purported \nlogic aside, the text simply does not contain any \nlanguage conditioning the ability to perform on \nwhether a person holds or desires a job.  \nTitle I makes no exceptions to the \u201ccan perform\u201d \nclause. Courts should not \u201celaborate unprovided-for \n\n39 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nexceptions to a text\u2026\u2018[I]f the Congress [had] intended \nto provide...exceptions, it would have done so in clear \nlanguage.\u2019\u201d Scalia & Garner, 93. Petitioner improperly \nargues for a \u201ctacit exception,\u201d Bostock. 590 U.S. at 669, \nto Title I\u2019s \u201ccan perform\u201d clause. But \u201cwhen Congress \nchooses not to include any exceptions to a broad rule, \ncourts apply the broad rule.\u201d Id. \nThe correct reading of Title I to only prohibit \ndiscrimination against an individual who presently \nholds or desires a job that she can perform gives effect \nto all of the words in \u00a7\u00a7 12112(a) and 12111(8). \nPetitioner's interpretation, on the other hand, \nrequires the addition and subtraction of language \nfrom Title I. It does not, however, prohibit \ndiscrimination against an individual who can perform \nthe essential functions of the job only if she holds or \ndesires one. \nEven if Congress wanted to imply that the \nperformance requirement was conditioned upon an \nindividual having or wanting a job, Congress would \nnot have referred to \u201cthe employment position\u201d that \nsuch individual holds or desires. Id. \u00a7 12111(8) \n(emphasis added). By referring to \u201cthe employment \nposition\u201d the text clearly indicates that the job \ncurrently exists. Petitioner\u2019s reading replaces \u201cthe\u201d \nwith \u201can\u201d to read the definition as only requiring the \nability to perform if the individual has an employment \nposition. This addition and subtraction of text cannot \nbe countenanced by this Court.  \nPetitioner argues Congress did not include \u201can\u201d \ninstead of \u201cthe\u201d because that would have made the \nstatute too confusing. Pet. Br. 44. As already \ndiscussed, Congress knew exactly how to expand the \n\n40 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nADA\u2019s protections to other individuals besides current \nemployees and applicants. See supra 36-37. It also \nwould have been a very simple matter for Congress to \ndo what the Second and Third Circuits did to Title I by \ninserting a \u201cnarrow exception\u201d to the \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d definition for retirees. Smith, 745 Fed. \nAppx. at 426. Congress did none of these things and \nPetitioner\u2019s arguments fail.  \nb. \nPetitioner\u2019s \n\u201cconditional \nmandate\u201d \ninterpretation opens the door to a host of new \n\u201cqualified individuals\u201d none of whom Congress \nintended to protect. It will create bizarre incentives for \nemployees to simply deny desiring a job or promotion \nto circumvent the requirement that they be able to \nperform it. An employee totally incapable of \nperforming a certain position could sue if she is not \ngiven the position because of her disability. So long as \nshe doesn\u2019t apply for the promotion or otherwise \nindicate that she \u201cdesires\u201d it, she can sue if a non-\ndisabled employee is given the position over her \ndespite her inability to perform the position because of \nher disability. Petitioner\u2019s \u201cconditional mandate\u201d test \nis unworkable and should be rejected.  \nc. While Petitioner argues that retirees are \n\u201cqualified individuals\u201d who need not satisfy the \u201ccan \nperform\u201d clause, the United States takes a different \napproach that also fails. U.S. Amicus Br. 30. It argues \npost-employment discrimination against a retiree \n\u201cretroactively\u201d changes the terms of employment and \nso \u201cit is naturally described as discrimination against \na qualified individual...even if the plaintiff is no longer \nemployed.\u201d Id. What the United States characterizes \nas a \u201cretroactive change\u201d to the terms of employment \n\n41 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nis actually just a breach of contract. No court would \never describe such a breach as a \u201cretroactive change\u201d \nto a contract. If it did, then all a breaching party would \nhave to do to \u201cretroactively change\u201d the terms of a \ncontract would be to breach it. This, of course, is \nabsurd.  \nAnd whether the changed term of employment is \na contractual term or just a privilege, is irrelevant. \nThere is no time machine that an employer travels in \nto alter the terms or privileges that existed during \nemployment. Those terms and privileges remain the \nsame regardless of any later refusal to honor them. \nTherefore, it is legally unsound to say that a present \nbreach is a past harm to a plaintiff when she was a \n\u201cqualified individual.\u201d A post-employment change only \naffects someone who is unqualified. Moreover, the \nchange happened during Petitioner\u2019s employment in \n2003, but she waived any such claim. So the United \nStates\u2019 argument is purely hypothetical.  \nThe United States primarily argues for reversal \non the grounds Petitioner disclaimed. Its arguments \nfail for all the same reasons described above in Part I. \nIts focus on the alleged discrimination occurring \nduring employment confirms Title I\u2019s purpose to \nprohibit such acts during, not after, employment.  \n \n\n42 \n\u0003\n\u0003\n2. \nPetitioner\u2019s interpretation of the \n\u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d \ndefinition \nsolely \nas \na \nscreen \nto \nprotect \nemployers renders \u00a7\u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A), \n(b)(6), (b)(7), and (d)(2) superfluous. \nPetitioner argues that \u00a7\u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A), (b)(6), \n(b)(7), and (d)(2) allegedly all do the same work as the \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition by allowing employers \nto take actions against disabled employees that \u201care \njustified in relation to the operation of their business.\u201d \nPet. Br. 31. But if these subsections of \u00a7 12112 perform \nthis function, then the same function allegedly \nperformed by \u00a7 12111(8) is rendered superfluous. \nInstead, \u00a7 12111(8) as used in the general rule, tells \nemployers who they may not discriminate against\u2014\nthose who hold or want jobs they can perform\u2014but \nthen \u00a7\u00a7 12112(b) and (d)(2) provide exceptions to that \ngeneral prohibition for the protection of the business.  \nAccordingly, \nPetitioner\u2019s \nreliance \non \nthese \nsubsections undermines her argument and proves the \nCity\u2019s point that the general rule sets forth its limited \nprotection of current employees and applicants who \ncan perform despite their disabilities, but then \u00a7\u00a7 \n12112(b) and (d) include exceptions to that general \nprohibition to allow an employer to discriminate \nagainst these \u201cqualified individuals\u201d where it is \nnecessary to protect the business. \n \n\n43 \n\u0003\n\u0003\n3. \nThe \nEleventh \nCircuit\u2019s \ninterpretation does not render \u00a7 \n12112(b)(5)(A) superfluous.  \nPetitioner argues that if the \u201cqualified individual\u201d \ndefinition excludes those who do not hold or desire a \njob, then \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A)\u2019s reference to an \u201cotherwise \nqualified individual with a disability who is an \napplicant or employee\u201d is surplusage. Pet. Br. 32-33. \nShe is incorrect. \nSection 12112(b) is the \u201cconstruction\u201d provision \nexplaining that the term \u201cdiscriminate against a \nqualified individual on the basis of disability,\u201d \nincludes several forms of discrimination. Section \n12112(b) is replete with references to \u201ca job applicant \nor employee,\u201d sometimes repeating that phrase \nmultiple times within one subsection. See, e.g., \u00a7 \n12112(b)(1). Section 12112(b)(2) also repeats the \nreference to a \u201cqualified applicant or employee\u201d even \nthough it is defining what is included in the term \n\u201cdiscriminate against a qualified individual.\u201d Id. \u00a7 \n12112(b)(2). Likewise, \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(B) refers to a \u201cjob \napplicant or employee who is an otherwise qualified \nindividual with a disability.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(B).  \nThe repetition of these phrases serves only to \nemphasize how important it was to Congress that a \nplaintiff have an actual, present relationship with an \nemployer, as an employee or job applicant, to sue. \nWhile a \u201cqualified individual\u201d may be someone who \nmerely \u201cdesires\u201d a job under \u00a7 12111(8), \u00a7 12112(b) \nclarifies that the individual must actually apply for a \njob to establish a sufficient relationship to the \nemployer to justify imposing obligations on the \nemployer under the ADA. There is no surplusage \n\n44 \n\u0003\n\u0003\ncaused by the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s correct reading of \nTitle I.  \nBut even assuming that the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s \ninterpretation renders the phrase \u201capplicants and \nemployees\u201d in \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A) somehow superfluous, \nthat should not alter the conclusion. \u201cThe canon \nagainst surplusage is not an absolute rule.\u201d Marx v. \nGeneral Revenue Corp., 568 U.S. 371, 385 (2013). \n4. \nPetitioner\u2019s arguments regarding \ncommon usage, grammar and logic \nrely on false analogies.  \nBy focusing on the definition of a \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d in isolation, Petitioner concocts several \nfalse \nanalogies \nin \nsupport \nof \nher \nstrained \ninterpretation. When the definition is read out of \ncontext, it is stripped of its meaning and malleable to \nPetitioner\u2019s many unhelpful hypotheticals. She posits \na movie theater rule: \u201cYou can\u2019t watch the movie \nunless you silence your cell phone.\u201d Pet. Br. 35. She \nstates if you don\u2019t have a phone surely you don\u2019t \nviolate the rule. Id. This rule is not analogous at all to \nTitle I. \nThis rule imposes a prohibition on the patron\u2014\nnot the movie theater. And the prohibition against the \npatron is imposed by the movie theater\u2014not a \nregulator of the movie theater and so the intent behind \nthe rule is not analogous to Title I. When the theater \nis the one imposing the restriction, its intent is to \nprotect other patrons from disruption by noisy cell \nphones. But if a patron does not hold a cell phone, then \nthe theater\u2019s concern is not implicated. So, of course, \nthe theater will let you in if you don\u2019t have a cell \n\n45 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nphone. After all, its motivation is to sell as many \ntickets as possible so long as the ticket holders are not \ndisturbing others.  \nBut a proper analogy to Title I would require a \nhypothetical rule that says, \u201cno movie theater shall \nrefuse entry to an individual who can silence the cell \nphone that such individual holds.\u201d If a patron doesn\u2019t \nhold a cell phone, then under this properly analogous \nrule, the theater can grant the patron entry if it wants, \nbut nothing in the rule prohibits the movie theater \nfrom refusing that patron entry. This is because the \nonly thing that is prohibited by the regulator is refusal \nof entry to people who hold cells phones that can be \nsilenced. The focus, from the regulator\u2019s perspective, \nis clearly on protecting people with cell phones.  \nAt first blush, it may seem strange that this \nfictional regulator did not prohibit discrimination \nagainst people without cell phones, but not once we \nrealize that the regulator enacted the rule with the \nprotection of people with cell phones in mind. Perhaps \nthe regulator was concerned with making sure people \nwith cell phones can still attend movies and did not \nwant theaters to reject them solely because their cell \nphones could disturb others. So long as the cell phone \ncan be silenced, the regulator prohibits movie theaters \nfrom refusing entry to people with cell phones.  \nSimilarly, under Title I, when we realize that \nCongress was concerned only with protecting those \nwho work or want to work, we can see the clear \npurpose of the \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition within \nthe anti-discrimination rule to prohibit discrimination \nsolely against those individuals as long as they can \nperform despite their disabilities. It was not concerned \n\n46 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nwith anyone else in this one statute. It doesn\u2019t mean \nthat employers have a license to discriminate against \nretirees. There are several other laws that would \nprohibit such misconduct. Disabled retirees may face \nchallenges, but Title I \u201cneed not address all aspects of \na problem in one fell swoop; policymakers may focus \non their most pressing concerns.\u201d Williams-Yulee v. \nFlorida Bar, 575 U.S. 433, 449 (2015). \nPetitioner provides other purported analogies all \nsuffering from the same flaw as her movie theater \nhypothetical. Their structure does not mimic Title I\u2019s \nstructure and are thus useless to this Court. For \nexample, her \u201ccommand\u201d analogy fails because \nCongress did not make a command to an employee. \nPet. Br. 39. She argues \u201cWhen a command is \nconditional, its condition may be either overt or \nexplicit.\u201d Id. The command, \u201cDrive carefully!\u201d is \nconditioned on the subject of that command to be in \nthe act of driving. But Congress did not command an \nemployee to \u201cPerform your job!\u201d If it did, then perhaps \nwe could say that an employee must perform only if \nshe has a job. The \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition, \nhowever, does not appear within a command directed \nat an employee. It appears within the anti-\ndiscrimination provision commanding employers not \nto discriminate against individuals who can perform \ntheir jobs.  \nNo matter how many expedient hypotheticals \nPetitioner poses, there is only one way this Court can \nreach her desired outcome\u2014by creating an exception, \njust for retirees, to the plain language prohibiting \ndiscrimination solely against those who can perform \ntheir jobs. \n\n47 \n\u0003\n\u0003\n \n5. \nPetitioner\u2019s \nargument \nthat \nher \ninterpretation is consistent with \nTitle VII and avoids surplusage and \nabsurd consequences, fails. \na. The Eleventh Circuit\u2019s interpretation \ndoes not render the \u201ccompensation\u201d clause of \u00a7 \n12112(a) superfluous. Simply because Title I \nprotects \n\u201ccompensation,\u201d \nincluding \nretirement \nbenefits, does not mean that Title I was designed to \n\u201cprotect \nretirees\u201d \nfrom \npost-employment \ndiscrimination. Pet. Br. 46. The purpose of the \n\u201ccompensation\u201d clause cannot be pursued at the \nexpense of negating Title I\u2019s plain text, especially \nwhen there are numerous circumstances where the \nreference to \u201ccompensation\u201d can be given effect \nwithout \nnullifying \nthe \n\u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d \nlimitations.  \nBecause litigants can sue employers who adopt \ndiscriminatory fringe benefits policies during their \nemployment when they are \u201cqualified individuals,\u201d \neffect can be given to the \u201ccompensation\u201d clause \nwithout \nnegating \nthe \n\u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d \nrequirements. \u201cCompensation\u201d and \u201cfringe benefits\u201d \ncan include a variety of benefits received during \nemployment such as health insurance, vacation pay, \novertime pay, and sick leave. While retirement \nbenefits might be among the items that make up the \nuniverse of compensation or benefits, they are not the \nexclusive or the most important benefit. Because \nemployees who satisfy the plain language of the \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition receive multiple types \nof \u201ccompensation\u201d and \u201cbenefits,\u201d the inclusion of \n\n48 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nthose terms in Title I can be given effect without \nrewriting \u00a7 12111(8). \nThe fact that retirees cannot sue regarding \ndiscriminatory benefits and compensation in every \nscenario does not render Title I\u2019s references to \n\u201ccompensation\u201d superfluous. \u201cNo text pursues its \npurposes at all costs.\u201d Scalia & Garner, 57; Clifford F. \nMacEvoy Co. v. U.S. for Use & Benefit of Calvin \nTomkins Co., 322 U.S. 102, 107 (1944) (even a \u201chighly \nremedial\u201d \nstatute \n\u201centitled \nto \na \nliberal \nconstruction\u2026does not justify ignoring plain words of \nlimitation.\u201d). This \u201cCourt cannot construe a statute in \na way that negates its plain text, and here, Congress \nexpressly limited,\u201d Honeycutt v. United States, 581 \nU.S. 443, 454 n. 2 (2017), Title I\u2019s protections to those \nwho can perform the jobs they hold or desire.  \nb. In the context of a \u201cqualified individual,\u201d \nTitle I and Title VII are not analogous. Petitioner \nargues that her interpretation of Title I would \nmaintain \u201ccongruity between the ADA and Title VII, \nthe statute on which much of title I was \u2018modeled.\u2019\u201d \nPet. Br. 46. While Title I \u201cborrows much of its \nprocedural \nframework \nfrom \n[T]itle \nVII...by \nincorporating title VII's enforcement provisions,\u201d Title \nI \u201cborrows much of its substantive framework from \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.\u201d \nH.R.Rep. No. 101\u2013485(III), at 31 (1990) (emphasis \nadded). The \u201cconcept\u201d of a \u201cqualified individual\u201d who \nmust be able to perform the \u201cessential functions\u201d of her \njob comes from \u201cthe regulations implementing...the \nRehabilitation Act\u201d\u2014not Title VII. Id. at 33. \nThere is no counterpart to the \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d definition in Title VII, so loose references \n\n49 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nto Title VII and the ADA as \u201csibling statutes,\u201d Ford, \n145 F.3d at 606, obscure these important differences \nin the text. Although Title VII and the ADA may be \nclosely related in other respects, on the issue here \u201cthe \nstatutes are not analogous.\u201d Weyer, 198 F.3d at 1111. \nc. Petitioner\u2019s reliance on the absurd results \ntest fails. Petitioner argues there is no plausible \nexplanation for the \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition to \nexclude retirees and she invokes the \u201cabsurd results\u201d \ntest. Pet. Br. 46-47. This \u201cCourt rarely invokes such a \ntest to override unambiguous legislation.\u201d Barnhart, \n534 U.S. at 459. This test is stringent and states \u201cthe \nabsurdity must consist of a disposition that no \nreasonable person could intend.\u201d Scalia & Garner, \n237.  \nHere, there are \u201cseveral explanations for why \nCongress would have purposefully exempted\u201d retirees \nfrom the statute\u2019s coverage. Barnhart, 534 U.S. at 459. \n\u201cCongress could reasonably decide to enable disabled \npeople who can work with reasonable accommodation \nto get and keep jobs, without also deciding to equalize \npost-employment fringe benefits for people who \ncannot work.\u201d Weyer, 198 F.3d at 1112. \u201cCongress has \nthe authority to improve the circumstances of disabled \npeople in some respects even if it does not improve \nthem in all respects.\u201d Id. \u201cLegislation often results \nfrom a delicate compromise among competing \ninterests and concerns.\u201d Id. at 1113; Barnhart, 534 \nU.S. \nat \n461 \n(any \n\u201cdissatisfaction\u201d \nwith \nthe \nconsequences of plain text is \u201coften the cost of \nlegislative compromise.\u201d). \u201cIf we were to \u2018fully \neffectuate\u2019 what we take to be the underlying policy of \nthe legislation, without careful attention to the \n\n50 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nqualifying words in the statute, then we would be \noverturning \nthe \nnuanced \ncompromise \nin \nthe \nlegislation, and substituting our own cruder, less \nresponsive mandate for the law that was actually \npassed.\u201d Weyer, 198 F.3d at 1113. \nTitle I, thus, reasonably prohibits employers from \ndiscriminating solely \u201cagainst people with disabilities \nthat do not prevent job performance, but when a \ndisability renders a person unable to perform the \nessential functions of the job, that disability renders \nhim or her unqualified.\u201d Stevens v. Rite Aid Corp., 851 \nF.3d 224, 229 (2d Cir. 2017). When the perceived gap \nin Title I for the protection of retirees is understood for \nwhat it really is\u2014important compromise that \nfacilitates action on the more pressing problems of the \nday\u2014the consequences of Title I\u2019s plain language are \nnot at all \u201csurprising\u201d or \u201cabsurd.\u201d Pet. Br. 27, 47. \nCongress enacted Title I to provide a legal remedy \nfor disabled workers that did not previously exist. See \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(a)(4). At the time, several other \nfederal statutes existed for the protection of employee \nretirement benefits such as ERISA, the Social \nSecurity Act, and the Medicare Act. The Equal \nProtection Clause provided an additional remedy for \npublic employees. See Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, \n522 (2004) (\u201cemphasiz[ing] that the House and Senate \nCommittee \nReports \non \nthe \nADA \nfocused \non \n\u2018[d]iscrimination [in]...employment in the private \nsector,\u2019 and made no mention of discrimination in \npublic employment.\u201d) (emphasis added by the Court). \nAdditionally, numerous common law claims such as \nbreach of contract, promissory estoppel, or fraud in the \ninducement \nalong \nwith \nstate \nstatutory \nand \n\n51 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nunconstitutional takings claims could be brought to \nobtain promised benefits.  \nThus, before the ADA, a disabled employee could \nnot sue her private employer for discrimination, \nbreach of contract, or any of the other above remedies \nif she accepted a job knowing that her contract \nincluded a lesser pension than a similarly situated \nnon-disabled employee. And even if she didn\u2019t know \nabout a secret discriminatory decision applied to her \nduring her employment but later discovered it, there \nwas no law that prohibited such discrimination. The \nADA stepped in to prohibit such discriminatory \npolicies from being applied to current employees and \napplicants. Such policies could dissuade a disabled job \napplicant from accepting that job or force a disabled \nemployee to search elsewhere for a fair pension. And \nin the absence of the ADA, that employee would be \nforced to do so without remedy. Title I\u2019s \u201clanguage [is] \nwell \ndesigned \nto \nhelp \npeople \nget \nand \nkeep \njobs\u2026\u201dWeyer, 198 F.3d at 1112. \nBut an employer who does not discriminate until \npost-employment does not deter employment. If the \nemployer has a facially neutral pension policy that \npromises a pension to all retirees, but the employer \nwithholds the pension from a disabled retiree, then \nthat retiree has a clear breach of a contract claim \nalong with all of the other remedies mentioned above \nunder ERISA, the Social Security Act, etc. Under \nFlorida law, \u201conce a participating member reaches \nretirement status, the benefits under the terms of the \nact in effect at the time of the employee's retirement \nvest.\u201d Bien, 209 So. 3d at 3. \u201cThe contractual \nrelationship may not thereafter be affected or \n\n52 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nadversely \naltered \nby \nsubsequent \nstatutory \nenactments.\u201d Id. \nThus, the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s interpretation does \nnot \u201callow employers to freely discriminate against \ntheir former employees.\u201d Pet. Br. 47. Employers risk \nsignificant liability for allowing their animus against \nthe disabled to lead them to breach their contracts or \nviolate other laws post-employment. The remedies for \nviolating these laws are not always the same as the \nADA\u2019s remedies. But the fact that these remedies pre-\ndated the ADA demonstrates the reasonableness of \nCongress\u2019 decision to focus on the more pressing issue \nof the day for which there was no remedy at all\u2014\ndiscriminatory \npolicies \nthat \nexcluded \ncapable \nindividuals from the workforce simply because they \nwere disabled. Because there are several plausible \nexplanations for the line drawn by the plain text of \nTitle I, Petitioner\u2019s arguments fail the absurd results \ntest. The Eleventh Circuit correctly held that \nPetitioner could not state a claim for disability \ndiscrimination under the ADA.\u0003\n\u0003\n \n\n53 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nCONCLUSION \nFor these reasons, this Court should affirm.  \n \nRespectfully submitted, \nJESSICA C.

Shell Oil*), and formulates a new, highly targeted plan to find the Petition for Certiorari. This document is the perfect next step as it will explicitly detail the circuit split and the petitioner's core arguments, which is precisely the information needed to predict the Court's reasoning. This strategic re-orientation dramatically increases the probability of acquiring the necessary information to solve the task.\n\nDesign EIG (0.9): This action demonstrates a crucial and generalizable reasoning pattern for a SCOTUS prediction agent: 'diagnose failure -> re-analyze legal fundamentals -> formulate a new, document-specific search plan.' This is a powerful self-correction loop. Observing the effectiveness of this pivot from broad searches ('briefs') to a specific, foundational document ('Petition for Certiorari') based on an understanding of legal precedent provides substantial insight into designing a robust and adaptive agent. It's a prime example of how to recover from information-gathering failures.\n\nJoint EIG (1.8): The action is highly valuable on both fronts. It gets the agent unstuck on the specific task by creating a clear and promising path forward, and it showcases a sophisticated, repeatable problem-solving heuristic that is central to effective legal reasoning and information retrieval.",

STANLEY, \nPlaintiff-Appellant, \nv.  \nCITY OF SANFORD, FLORIDA,  \nDefendant-Appellee. \n \nOn Appeal from the United States District Court  \nfor the Middle District of Florida \nD.C. Docket No. 6:20-cv-00629-WWB-GJK \n  \n \nBefore: WILSON, GRANT, and BRASHER, Circuit Judges.  \n \n \n\n \n \n-App. 2a- \nBRASHER, Circuit Judge:  \nCan a former employee sue under Title I of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act for discrimination in post-\nemployment distribution of fringe benefits? We answered \n\u201cno\u201d in Gonzales v. Garner Food Services, Inc., 89 F.3d \n1523 (11th Cir. 1996). Gonzales put us at odds with the \nSecond and Third Circuits but in league with the Sixth, \nSeventh, and Ninth Circuits. In this appeal, we must \ndecide whether Gonzales is still good law after (1) the \nSupreme Court\u2019s decision about Title VII retaliation in \nRobinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337 (1997), and (2) \nCongress\u2019s changes to the text of the ADA. \nWe believe Gonzales is still good law. We thus reaffirm \nthat a Title I plaintiff must \u201chold[] or desire[]\u201d an \nemployment position with the defendant at the time of the \ndefendant\u2019s allegedly wrongful act. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8). \nBecause plaintiff Karyn Stanley is suing over the \ntermination of retirement benefits when she neither held \nnor desired to hold an employment position with her \nformer employer, the City of Sanford, Gonzales bars her \nclaim. We therefore affirm the district court. \nI. \nKaryn Stanley became a firefighter for the City of \nSanford, Florida, in 1999. She served the City in that \ncapacity for about fifteen years until she was diagnosed \nwith Parkinson\u2019s disease in 2016. Although she managed \nto continue working as a firefighter for about two more \nyears, her disease and accompanying physical disabilities \neventually left her incapable of performing her job. So, at \nthe age of 47, Stanley took disability retirement on \nNovember 1, 2018. \nWhen Stanley retired, she continued to receive free \n\n \n \n-App. 3a- \nhealth insurance through the City. Under a policy in effect \nwhen Stanley first joined the fire department, employees \nretiring for qualifying disability reasons, such as Stanley\u2019s \nParkinson\u2019s disease, received free health insurance until \nthe age of 65. But, unbeknownst to Stanley, the City \nchanged its benefits plan in 2003. Under the new plan, \ndisability retirees such as Stanley are entitled to the \nhealth insurance subsidy for only twenty-four months \nafter retiring. Stanley was thus set to become responsible \nfor her own health insurance premiums beginning on \nDecember 1, 2020. She filed this suit in April 2020, seeking \nto establish her entitlement to the long-term healthcare \nsubsidy. \nStanley believes the City\u2019s decision to trim the health \ninsurance subsidy was discriminatory against her as a \ndisabled retiree. Her complaint alleged violations of Title \nI \nof \nthe \nAmericans \nwith \nDisabilities \nAct, \nthe \nRehabilitation Act, and the Florida Civil Rights Act. She \nalso asserted that, by changing the benefits plan, the City \nunconstitutionally discriminated against her in violation \nof the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment. Finally, she brought a claim under Florida \nStatutes section 112.0801, which authorizes municipalities \nto offer employees health insurance. \nThe district court entered judgment for the City. On a \nmotion to dismiss, the district court concluded that \nStanley\u2019s claims under the ADA, the Rehab Act, and the \nFlorida Civil Rights Act were insufficiently pleaded. \nRelying on our decision in Gonzales, the district court \nreasoned that Stanley could not state a plausible disability \ndiscrimination claim because the discriminatory act \nalleged\u2014the cessation of the health insurance premium \npayments\u2014would occur while Stanley was no longer \n\n \n \n-App. 4a- \nemployed by the City. The district court later granted \nsummary judgment to the City on Stanley\u2019s claims under \nthe Equal Protection Clause and Florida Statutes section \n112.0801(1). It reasoned that the City\u2019s decision satisfied \nrational basis review under the Equal Protection Clause \nand that nothing in the Florida statute prevented the \namendment to the benefits plan. \nStanley timely appealed. \nII. \nWe review a dismissal for failure to state a claim for \nwhich relief may be granted de novo. United States ex rel. \nOsheroff v. Humana, Inc., 776 F.3d 805, 809 (11th Cir. \n2015). We ask whether the complaint alleges \u201csufficient \nfactual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief \nthat is plausible on its face.\u2019\u201d Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. \n662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 \nU.S. 544, 570 (2007)). Likewise, we review a grant of \nsummary judgment de novo. Sunbeam Television Corp. v. \nNielsen Media Rsch., Inc., 711 F.3d 1264, 1270 (11th Cir. \n2013). Summary judgment is proper if the movant shows \nthat there is no genuine dispute about any material fact \nand the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. \nId. We view the summary judgment record in the light \nmost favorable to the non-moving party, and we draw all \nreasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party. \nId. \nIII. \nA. \nWe begin with Stanley\u2019s claims under Title I of the \nADA, the Rehab Act, and the Florida Civil Rights Act. \nThe parties agree that our disposition of Stanley\u2019s Title I \nclaim \nwill \ncontrol \nall \nthree \nstatutory \ndisability \n\n \n \n-App. 5a- \ndiscrimination claims. See Boyle v. City of Pell City, 866 \nF.3d 1280, 1288 (11th Cir. 2017); D\u2019Angelo v. ConAgra \nFoods, Inc., 422 F.3d 1220, 1224 n.2 (11th Cir. 2005). \nAccordingly, our analysis of Title I and the viability of \nStanley\u2019s claim under it applies with equal force to her \nclaims under the Rehab Act and the Florida Civil Rights \nAct. \nThe dispute between the parties turns on the \ndefinition section of the ADA. Title I of the ADA, as \noriginally enacted, made it unlawful to \u201cdiscriminate \nagainst a qualified individual with a disability because of \nthe disability of such individual in regard to . . . employee \ncompensation, . . . and other terms, conditions, and \nprivileges of employment.\u201d Americans with Disabilities \nAct of 1990, Pub. L. 101-336, \u00a7 102(a), 104 Stat. 331\u201332 \n(1990). The statute defined a \u201cqualified individual with a \ndisability\u201d as someone \u201cwho, with or without reasonable \naccommodation, can perform the essential functions of the \nemployment position that such individual holds or \ndesires.\u201d Id. \u00a7 101(8), 104 Stat. 331 (emphasis added). \nWe held in Gonzales that a former employee who does \nnot hold or desire to hold an employment position cannot \nsue over discriminatory post-employment benefits. 89 \nF.3d 1523, 1531. We recognized that the ADA protects \nagainst discrimination in fringe benefits, such as health \ninsurance, because these benefits have always been \nrecognized as one example of a term, condition, or \nprivilege of employment. See Pub. L. 101-336, \u00a7 102(b)(2), \n104 Stat. 331; Gonzales, 89 F.3d at 1526 & n.9. But because \nthe ADA prohibits discrimination only as to those \nindividuals who hold or desire to hold a job, we reasoned \nthat a former employee cannot bring suit under Title I to \nremedy discrimination in the provision of post-\n\n \n \n-App. 6a- \nemployment fringe benefits. Under the \u201cprior-panel-\nprecedent rule,\u201d we are required \u201cto follow the precedent \nof the first panel to address the relevant issue, unless and \nuntil the first panel\u2019s holding is overruled by the Court \nsitting en banc or by the Supreme Court.\u201d Scott v. United \nStates, 890 F.3d 1239, 1257 (11th Cir. 2018) (quotation \nmarks and citation omitted). And any later en banc or \nSupreme Court decisions must \u201cactually abrogate or \ndirectly conflict with, as opposed to merely weaken, the \nholding of the prior panel.\u201d United States v. Kaley, 579 \nF.3d 1246, 1255 (11th Cir. 2005). \nStanley argues that her claim is not barred by \nGonzales for three reasons. First, she points to a Supreme \nCourt case handed down shortly after Gonzales, which \nshe says calls into question our reasoning in Gonzales. \nSecond, she points to statutory changes in the text of the \nADA, which she says undermine the result in Gonzales. \nThird, she argues that Gonzales is distinguishable. We \nwill start by unpacking our reasoning in Gonzales, and \nthen address each argument in turn. \n1. \nGonzales was the first time we considered a former \nemployee\u2019s ability to sue under Title I. Timothy \nBourgeois, who suffered from AIDS, was fired from his \njob but kept receiving health insurance through his \nformer employer. Gonzales, 89 F.3d at 1524. About six \nmonths after the termination, Bourgeois\u2019s former \nemployer amended its health insurance plan by capping \nAIDS-related coverage. Id. In the time between that \namendment \nand \nBourgeois\u2019s \ndeath, \nhe \nincurred \nsignificant treatment costs for which he was denied \ncoverage. Id. at 1525. August Gonzales, the administrator \nof Bourgeois\u2019s estate, sued under Title I, alleging that the \n\n \n \n-App. 7a- \ninsurance plan amendment was unlawful disability \ndiscrimination. Id. at 1524. \nRelying on \u201cthe plain language of the ADA,\u201d we held \nthat Bourgeois (and thus his estate) had no viable Title I \nclaim \u201cbecause he neither held nor desired to hold a \nposition with [his former employer] at or subsequent to \nthe time the alleged discriminatory conduct was \ncommitted.\u201d Id. at 1526. That conclusion followed from the \ntext of Title I\u2019s anti-discrimination provision. It expressly \napplied only to \u201cqualified individual[s] with a disability\u201d \nwho \u201chold[]\u201d or \u201cdesire[]\u201d an \u201cemployment position.\u201d Pub. \nL. 101-336, \u00a7 101(8), 104 Stat. 331. We also relied on Title \nI\u2019s listed examples of discrimination, which mentioned \nonly \n\u201cqualified \nindividual[s] \nwith \na \ndisability,\u201d \n\u201capplicant[s],\u201d and \u201cemployee[s]\u201d as possible victims of \ndisability discrimination. Id. \u00a7 102(b)(1), 104 Stat. 332; see \nGonzales, 89 F.3d at 1526\u201327 & nn. 10\u201311. We explained \nthat each of these terms had an inherent temporal \nqualification: a qualified individual with a disability held \nor desired to hold a job when the discrimination occurred; \nan employee was \u201can individual employed by an \nemployer\u201d when the discrimination occurred; and an \napplicant, although not defined by Title I, was necessarily \nsomeone who had applied for a job when the \ndiscrimination occurred. Gonzales, 89 F.3d at 1526\u201327 \n(citation omitted). \nIn interpreting the ADA in Gonzales, we recognized \nthat other employment discrimination statutes, such as \nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, have been \nconstrued to protect former employees. See id. at 1527\u2013\n29. We noted, however, that the precedents adopting that \ninterpretation arose in the context of retaliation, not \ndiscrimination. See id. We found that distinction \n\n \n \n-App. 8a- \nimportant. As we had previously held, such a construction \nwas \u201cnecessary to provide meaning to anti-retaliation \nstatutory provisions and effectuate congressional intent.\u201d \nId. at 1529 (citing Bailey v. USX Corp., 850 F.2d 1506, \n1509 (11th Cir. 1998)). That is, by prohibiting retaliation, \na statute necessarily contemplated that it would apply to \nindividuals who accused a former employer of unlawful \nbehavior. See id. at 1529 n.14 (\u201c[W]e note that many \nretaliation claims are filed by former employees alleging, \nfor example, post-employment blacklisting.\u201d). So we \nendorsed a broad interpretation of anti-retaliation \nprovisions to avoid excluding an especially vulnerable \nclass of people from the statute\u2019s protection and thus \nundermining Congress\u2019s remedial scheme. \nWe explicitly declined to extend this reasoning to Title \nI discrimination claims in Gonzales. Title I\u2019s \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d definition, we said, was dispositive evidence \nthat \u201cCongress intended to limit the protection of Title I \nto either employees performing, or job applicants who \napply and can perform, the essential functions of available \njobs which their employers maintain.\u201d Id. at 1527. We \nconcluded that the plain language of Title I\u2019s anti-\ndiscrimination provision did not \u201cfrustrate the statute\u2019s \ncentral purpose\u201d\u2014i.e., protecting disabled people who can \nnevertheless perform the essential functions of a job\u2014the \nway that a \u201cliteral interpretation\u201d of other statutes\u2019 anti-\nretaliation provisions may have threatened to do. Id. at \n1528\u201329. Instead, to construe Title I to apply to former \nemployees would \u201cessentially render[] the [qualified \nindividual] requirement . . . meaningless.\u201d Id. at 1529. \nThus, after Gonzales, the rule in this circuit was \nsettled. To fall within Title I\u2019s anti-discrimination \nprovision, a plaintiff\u2019s claim must depend on an act \n\n \n \n-App. 9a- \ncommitted by the defendant while the plaintiff was either \nworking for the defendant or seeking to work for the \ndefendant. The result was that a former employee could \nnot sue for alleged discrimination in post-employment \nfringe benefits. \nThat settled rule was briefly disturbed five years later \nwhen a panel of this Court declared Gonzales overruled \nby intervening Supreme Court precedent. See Johnson v. \nK Mart Corp., 273 F.3d 1035 (11th Cir. 2001). The \nSupreme Court, in Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337 \n(1997), held that an individual could sue his or her former \nemployer under Title VII for a post-employment \nretaliatory act. The Johnson majority considered \nRobinson to be a decision of such magnitude that it \n\u201cmandate[d] the conclusion that Gonzales is no longer \ngood law and must be deemed overruled.\u201d Johnson, 273 \nF.3d at 1037. The Johnson majority then held that Title I \nprohibits discriminatory acts against current and former \nemployees alike. See id. \nBut Johnson\u2019s precedential life was short-lived. The \nopinion was vacated when this Court voted to rehear the \ncase en banc. Id. at 1070. K Mart later filed for \nbankruptcy, the parties settled, and the appeal was \ndismissed. See Johnson v. K Mart Corp., 281 F.3d 1368 \n(11th Cir. 2002) (en banc). Because of the bankruptcy and \nsettlement, we never issued an en banc opinion in \nJohnson. But the result of our en banc vacatur is that \nGonzales regained its status as this Court\u2019s governing \nprecedent on Title I\u2019s qualified individual requirement. \n2. \nWe now turn to Stanley\u2019s arguments. The centerpiece \nof Stanley\u2019s appeal is her request that we resurrect \nJohnson, ignore Gonzales, and hold that, after Robinson, \n\n \n \n-App. 10a- \nformer employees can sue under Title I for post-\nemployment \ndiscrimination. \nBut \nStanley \ngreatly \noverstates Robinson\u2019s impact. \u201cFor a Supreme Court \ndecision to undermine panel precedent to the point of \nabrogation, the decision must be clearly on point and \nclearly contrary to the panel precedent.\u201d Edwards v. U.S. \nAtt\u2019y Gen., 56 F.4th 951, 965 (11th Cir. 2022) (quotation \nmarks and citation omitted). This can happen \u201cwhere the \nSupreme Court has clearly set forth a new standard to \nevaluate\u201d a claim or issue. United States v. Archer, 531 \nF.3d 1347, 1352 (11th Cir. 2008). But Robinson did \nnothing of the sort. \nThe Supreme Court\u2019s holding in Robinson\u2014a Title \nVII retaliation case\u2014did not even upend our Title VII \nprecedents, much less our Title I caselaw. Long before \nRobinson, we had held that Title VII\u2019s anti-retaliation \nprovision allowed claims for post-employment retaliation. \nSee Gonzales, 89 F.3d at 1528\u201329. Robinson adopted the \nsame rule. But, in Gonzales, we distinguished Title I \ndiscrimination claims from our Title VII precedents based \non the different text of the ADA. Id. Because Robinson\u2019s \ninterpretation of Title VII did not change our Title VII \ncaselaw, it is hard to say it overruled our Title I caselaw. \nJudge Carnes said it best in his Johnson dissent: \u201cIt is a \nbit audacious . . . to say that a Supreme Court decision \nwhose holding was anticipated, acknowledged, and \nconsidered by a prior panel when deciding a different \nissue has undermined that prior panel\u2019s decision on the \ndifferent issue to such an extent that it may be \ndisregarded.\u201d Johnson, 273 F.3d at 1068 (Carnes, J., \ndissenting). \nLike its holding, Robinson\u2019s reasoning also does little \nto undermine Gonzales. Title VII\u2019s anti-retaliation \n\n \n \n-App. 11a- \nprovision at issue in Robinson applies to \u201cemployees.\u201d 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). Neither the statutory definition of \n\u201cemployees\u201d nor the anti-retaliation provision\u2019s specific \nuse of that term provides any \u201ctemporal qualifier.\u201d \nRobinson, 519 U.S. at 341\u201342. Looking to the rest of Title \nVII, the Robinson Court found that Title VII regularly \n\u201cuse[s] the term \u2018employees\u2019 to mean something more \ninclusive or different than \u2018current employees.\u2019\u201d Id. at 342. \nFor example, reinstatement is a Title VII remedy. Id. \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-5(g)(1), 2000e-16(b)). Because \n\u201cone does not \u2018reinstate\u2019 current employees,\u201d the \nRobinson Court reasoned that Title VII\u2019s remedial \nprovisions\u2019 use of \u201cemployees\u201d \u201cnecessarily refers to \nformer employees.\u201d Id. (brackets omitted). The term \n\u201cemployees\u201d in Title VII\u2019s anti-retaliation provision was, \ntherefore, ambiguous because it could be \u201cconsistent with \neither current or past employment.\u201d Id. \nTitle I\u2019s anti-discrimination provision is not afflicted \nwith any such ambiguity. There is a clear temporal \nqualifier in Title I: Only someone \u201cwho, with or without \nreasonable accommodation, can perform the essential \nfunctions of the employment position that such individual \nholds \nor \ndesires\u201d \nis \nprotected \nfrom \ndisability \ndiscrimination. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12111(8) (emphases added), \n12112(a); see also Slomcenski v. Citibank, N.A., 432 F.3d \n1271, 1280\u201381 (11th Cir. 2005). \u201cCan,\u201d \u201cholds,\u201d and \n\u201cdesires\u201d are in the present tense. So, to be a victim of \nunlawful disability discrimination, the plaintiff must \ndesire or already have a job with the defendant at the time \nthe defendant commits the discriminatory act. See \nMcKnight v. Gen. Motors Corp., 550 F.3d 519, 520 (6th \nCir. 2008); Weyer v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp., \n198 F.3d 1104, 1112 (9th Cir. 2000). And unlike Title VII\u2019s \nvaried use of \u201cemployees,\u201d Title I consistently uses the \n\n \n \n-App. 12a- \nterm \u201cqualified individual\u201d to refer to active employees or \ncurrent applicants. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12111(8), 12112(a)\u2013\n(b), 12114. \nWe acknowledge that the circuits are split. Our \nreading of Robinson aligns us with the Sixth, Seventh, and \nNinth Circuits. Each of those courts has held that (1) \nRobinson does not implicate Title I\u2019s anti-discrimination \nprovision and (2) Title I does not protect people who \nneither held nor desired a job with the defendant at the \ntime of discrimination. See McKnight, 550 F.3d at 522\u201328; \nMorgan v. Joint Admin. Bd., 268 F.3d 456, 457\u201359 (7th \nCir. 2001); Weyer, 198 F.3d at 1108\u201313. The Second and \nThird Circuits have held that Title I\u2019s anti-discrimination \nprovision is ambiguous, however, and have resolved that \npurported ambiguity in favor of former employees. See \nCastellano v. City of New York, 142 F.3d 58, 66\u201369 (2d Cir. \n1998); Ford v. Schering-Plough Corp., 145 F.3d 601, 604\u2013\n08 (3d Cir. 1998). \nWe are not convinced by Stanley\u2019s argument that we \nshould follow the Second and Third Circuits. The question \nwe are answering here is whether Robinson is so \ncompelling that it justifies ignoring a prior precedent. But \nneither the Second nor Third Circuit answered that \nquestion. Moreover, a review of those courts\u2019 decisions \nconvinces us that we are on the right side of the split. \nNeither court established that the text of Title I\u2019s anti-\ndiscrimination provision is ambiguous. Instead, the \nSecond and the Third Circuit expressed something \nbetween discomfort and disagreement with the policy \nchoice underlying the line, drawn by the text of the ADA, \nbetween disabled individuals who hold or desire to hold a \njob and those who do not. See Castellano, 142 F.3d at 67\u2013\n68; Ford, 145 F.3d at 605\u201306. But not \u201ceven the most \n\n \n \n-App. 13a- \nformidable policy arguments\u201d empower a court to ignore \nunambiguous text. BP P.L.C. v. Mayor & City Council of \nBaltimore, 141 S. Ct. 1532, 1542 (2021) (quotation marks \nand citation omitted). Nothing in Robinson, Castellano, or \nFord gives us a basis to ignore Gonzales. \n3. \nWe are also confident that Gonzales survived \nCongress\u2019s amendments to the ADA. Stanley points to \ntwo pieces of post-Gonzales legislation\u2014the ADA \nAmendments Act of 2008, Pub. L. 110-325, 122 Stat. 3553, \nand the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, Pub. L. 111-\n2, 123 Stat. 5\u2014and argues that because both acts \namended the ADA\u2019s text, we are free to, and should, \ndepart from Gonzales\u2019s interpretation of the original text \nof the ADA. It is of course true that when Congress \namends a statute, we need not follow decisions \ninterpreting discarded statutory language. But we \nconsider a prior precedent overruled by subsequent \nlegislation \nonly \nif \nthe \ncongressional \namendment \nrepresents \u201ca clear change in the law.\u201d Sassy Doll \nCreations, Inc. v. Watkins Motor Lines, Inc., 331 F.3d \n834, 840 (11th Cir. 2003) (citation omitted). Neither the \nADAAA nor the Fair Pay Act fits that bill. \nTurning first to the ADAAA, we cannot say that the \nADAAA upset Gonzales\u2019s interpretation of Title I\u2019s \nqualified individual definition. The ADAAA altered Title \nI\u2019s anti-discrimination provision. Where Title I originally \nsaid that employers could not \u201cdiscriminate against a \nqualified individual with a disability because of the \ndisability of such individual,\u201d Pub. L. 101-336, \u00a7 102(a), \n104 Stat. 331 (emphasis added), it now prohibits \ndiscrimination \u201cagainst a qualified individual on the basis \nof disability,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a) (emphasis added). But \n\n \n \n-App. 14a- \nthe definition of \u201cqualified individual\u201d\u2014someone who, \n\u201cwith or without reasonable accommodation\u201d is able \u201cto \nperform the essential functions of the employment \nposition that such individual holds or desires\u201d\u2014was \nmaterially unchanged by the ADAAA and remains in \neffect today. Compare Pub. L. 101-336, \u00a7 101(8), 104 Stat. \n331 with 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8); see Pub. L. 110-325, \u00a7 5(c), \n122 Stat. 3557 (striking \u201cwith a disability\u201d but otherwise \nleaving section 12111(8) as originally enacted). So the text \nupon which we relied in Gonzales is still the operative text \nin the statute. \nStanley contends that the result in Gonzales \nundermines Congress\u2019s purpose in adopting the ADAAA. \nThe purpose of the ADAAA, says Stanley, was to broaden \nthe scope of Title I. We have no doubt that is true; \nCongress said as much when passing the ADAAA. See \nPub. L. 110-325, \u00a7 2(a)\u2013(b), 122 Stat. 3553\u201354. But only the \nrare statute pursues its purpose to the exclusion of \neverything else. The ADAAA expanded Title I\u2019s \nprotections by expanding the mental and physical \nconditions that satisfy the statutory definition of \n\u201cdisability.\u201d See id. Nobody disputes that Stanley is \ndisabled. The issue here is whether Stanley was a \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d at the relevant point in time. And \nthe substance of the qualified individual standard, \nincluding the temporal qualifications, was unaffected by \nthe ADAAA. See Adair v. City of Muskogee, 823 F.3d \n1297, 1306\u201307 (10th Cir. 2016); Neely v. PSEG Tex., Ltd. \nP\u2019ship, 735 F.3d 242, 245\u201347 (5th Cir. 2013). \nSo too for the Fair Pay Act. To be sure, the Fair Pay \nAct effected a serious change in employment law. Before \nthe Fair Pay Act, discriminatory compensation claims \ngenerally accrued at only one point in time: when the \n\n \n \n-App. 15a- \ndiscriminatory compensation decision or practice was \nmade or adopted. See Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & \nRubber Co., Inc., 550 U.S. 618, 621 (2007). That rule posed \nserious statute of limitations problems for potential \nplaintiffs, who may not have even learned of the \ndiscriminatory compensation scheme until well after its \ninitial adoption. See id. at 649\u201350 (Ginsburg, J., \ndissenting). The Fair Pay Act reflects Congress\u2019s decision \nto relax the statute of limitations. Pub. L. 111-2. \u00a7 2(1)\u2013(2), \n123 Stat. 5. Now, a claim for discriminatory compensation \naccrues \u201cwhen a discriminatory compensation decision or \nother practice is adopted, when an individual becomes \nsubject to a discriminatory compensation decision or \nother practice, or when an individual is affected by \napplication of a discriminatory compensation decision or \nother practice . . . .\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A); see id. \u00a7 \n12117(a); Pub. L. 111-2, \u00a7 5(a), 123 Stat. 6 (stating that the \nFair Pay Act \u201cshall apply to claims of discrimination \nbrought under title I\u201d). \nThe Fair Pay Act made it easier to sue after \ndiscrimination\u2014as defined by Title I\u2014occurred. Cf. \nAT&T Corp. v. Hulteen, 556 U.S. 701, 713\u201316 (2009); \nMcReynolds v. Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc., 694 F.3d 873, \n888 (7th Cir. 2012). But, like the ADAAA, the Fair Pay Act \ndid not change the statutory language that we relied on in \nGonzales. Both before and after the Fair Pay Act, a Title \nI discrimination claim requires a plaintiff to show that he \nor she was a \u201cqualified individual\u201d who was subject to \ndiscriminatory \nterms, \nconditions, \nor \nbenefits \nof \nemployment. The Fair Pay Act\u2019s relaxed statute of \nlimitations helps a plaintiff only if that plaintiff otherwise \nhas a claim for discrimination. Because nothing in the Fair \nPay Act changes Title I\u2019s substantive requirements, \nGonzales is still binding precedent with respect to a \n\n \n \n-App. 16a- \nformer employee\u2019s ability to sue under Title I. \n4. \nBecause we hold that Gonzales is still good law, we \nmust ask whether Stanley was a disabled employee or job \napplicant capable of performing the job at the time of the \nalleged discrimination. There are three points in time in \nwhich Stanley can theoretically root her Title I claim: (1) \nin October 2003, when the City amended the benefits plan; \n(2) whenever she first became subject to the allegedly \ndiscriminatory provisions of the benefits plan as a \ndisabled employee; or (3) in December 2020, when she was \naffected by the termination of the health insurance \npremium payments. \nNeither option 1 nor option 3 works for Stanley. \nAlth\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

STANLEY, \nPlaintiff-Appellant, \nv.  \nCITY OF SANFORD, FLORIDA,  \nDefendant-Appellee. \n \nOn Appeal from the United States District Court  \nfor the Middle District of Florida \nD.C. Docket No. 6:20-cv-00629-WWB-GJK \n  \n \nBefore: WILSON, GRANT, and BRASHER, Circuit Judges.  \n \n \n\n \n \n-App. 2a- \nBRASHER, Circuit Judge:  \nCan a former employee sue under Title I of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act for discrimination in post-\nemployment distribution of fringe benefits? We answered \n\u201cno\u201d in Gonzales v. Garner Food Services, Inc., 89 F.3d \n1523 (11th Cir. 1996). Gonzales put us at odds with the \nSecond and Third Circuits but in league with the Sixth, \nSeventh, and Ninth Circuits. In this appeal, we must \ndecide whether Gonzales is still good law after (1) the \nSupreme Court\u2019s decision about Title VII retaliation in \nRobinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337 (1997), and (2) \nCongress\u2019s changes to the text of the ADA. \nWe believe Gonzales is still good law. We thus reaffirm \nthat a Title I plaintiff must \u201chold[] or desire[]\u201d an \nemployment position with the defendant at the time of the \ndefendant\u2019s allegedly wrongful act. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8). \nBecause plaintiff Karyn Stanley is suing over the \ntermination of retirement benefits when she neither held \nnor desired to hold an employment position with her \nformer employer, the City of Sanford, Gonzales bars her \nclaim. We therefore affirm the district court. \nI. \nKaryn Stanley became a firefighter for the City of \nSanford, Florida, in 1999. She served the City in that \ncapacity for about fifteen years until she was diagnosed \nwith Parkinson\u2019s disease in 2016. Although she managed \nto continue working as a firefighter for about two more \nyears, her disease and accompanying physical disabilities \neventually left her incapable of performing her job. So, at \nthe age of 47, Stanley took disability retirement on \nNovember 1, 2018. \nWhen Stanley retired, she continued to receive free \n\n \n \n-App. 3a- \nhealth insurance through the City. Under a policy in effect \nwhen Stanley first joined the fire department, employees \nretiring for qualifying disability reasons, such as Stanley\u2019s \nParkinson\u2019s disease, received free health insurance until \nthe age of 65. But, unbeknownst to Stanley, the City \nchanged its benefits plan in 2003. Under the new plan, \ndisability retirees such as Stanley are entitled to the \nhealth insurance subsidy for only twenty-four months \nafter retiring. Stanley was thus set to become responsible \nfor her own health insurance premiums beginning on \nDecember 1, 2020. She filed this suit in April 2020, seeking \nto establish her entitlement to the long-term healthcare \nsubsidy. \nStanley believes the City\u2019s decision to trim the health \ninsurance subsidy was discriminatory against her as a \ndisabled retiree. Her complaint alleged violations of Title \nI \nof \nthe \nAmericans \nwith \nDisabilities \nAct, \nthe \nRehabilitation Act, and the Florida Civil Rights Act. She \nalso asserted that, by changing the benefits plan, the City \nunconstitutionally discriminated against her in violation \nof the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment. Finally, she brought a claim under Florida \nStatutes section 112.0801, which authorizes municipalities \nto offer employees health insurance. \nThe district court entered judgment for the City. On a \nmotion to dismiss, the district court concluded that \nStanley\u2019s claims under the ADA, the Rehab Act, and the \nFlorida Civil Rights Act were insufficiently pleaded. \nRelying on our decision in Gonzales, the district court \nreasoned that Stanley could not state a plausible disability \ndiscrimination claim because the discriminatory act \nalleged\u2014the cessation of the health insurance premium \npayments\u2014would occur while Stanley was no longer \n\n \n \n-App. 4a- \nemployed by the City. The district court later granted \nsummary judgment to the City on Stanley\u2019s claims under \nthe Equal Protection Clause and Florida Statutes section \n112.0801(1). It reasoned that the City\u2019s decision satisfied \nrational basis review under the Equal Protection Clause \nand that nothing in the Florida statute prevented the \namendment to the benefits plan. \nStanley timely appealed. \nII. \nWe review a dismissal for failure to state a claim for \nwhich relief may be granted de novo. United States ex rel. \nOsheroff v. Humana, Inc., 776 F.3d 805, 809 (11th Cir. \n2015). We ask whether the complaint alleges \u201csufficient \nfactual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief \nthat is plausible on its face.\u2019\u201d Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. \n662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 \nU.S. 544, 570 (2007)). Likewise, we review a grant of \nsummary judgment de novo. Sunbeam Television Corp. v. \nNielsen Media Rsch., Inc., 711 F.3d 1264, 1270 (11th Cir. \n2013). Summary judgment is proper if the movant shows \nthat there is no genuine dispute about any material fact \nand the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. \nId. We view the summary judgment record in the light \nmost favorable to the non-moving party, and we draw all \nreasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party. \nId. \nIII. \nA. \nWe begin with Stanley\u2019s claims under Title I of the \nADA, the Rehab Act, and the Florida Civil Rights Act. \nThe parties agree that our disposition of Stanley\u2019s Title I \nclaim \nwill \ncontrol \nall \nthree \nstatutory \ndisability \n\n \n \n-App. 5a- \ndiscrimination claims. See Boyle v. City of Pell City, 866 \nF.3d 1280, 1288 (11th Cir. 2017); D\u2019Angelo v. ConAgra \nFoods, Inc., 422 F.3d 1220, 1224 n.2 (11th Cir. 2005). \nAccordingly, our analysis of Title I and the viability of \nStanley\u2019s claim under it applies with equal force to her \nclaims under the Rehab Act and the Florida Civil Rights \nAct. \nThe dispute between the parties turns on the \ndefinition section of the ADA. Title I of the ADA, as \noriginally enacted, made it unlawful to \u201cdiscriminate \nagainst a qualified individual with a disability because of \nthe disability of such individual in regard to . . . employee \ncompensation, . . . and other terms, conditions, and \nprivileges of employment.\u201d Americans with Disabilities \nAct of 1990, Pub. L. 101-336, \u00a7 102(a), 104 Stat. 331\u201332 \n(1990). The statute defined a \u201cqualified individual with a \ndisability\u201d as someone \u201cwho, with or without reasonable \naccommodation, can perform the essential functions of the \nemployment position that such individual holds or \ndesires.\u201d Id. \u00a7 101(8), 104 Stat. 331 (emphasis added). \nWe held in Gonzales that a former employee who does \nnot hold or desire to hold an employment position cannot \nsue over discriminatory post-employment benefits. 89 \nF.3d 1523, 1531. We recognized that the ADA protects \nagainst discrimination in fringe benefits, such as health \ninsurance, because these benefits have always been \nrecognized as one example of a term, condition, or \nprivilege of employment. See Pub. L. 101-336, \u00a7 102(b)(2), \n104 Stat. 331; Gonzales, 89 F.3d at 1526 & n.9. But because \nthe ADA prohibits discrimination only as to those \nindividuals who hold or desire to hold a job, we reasoned \nthat a former employee cannot bring suit under Title I to \nremedy discrimination in the provision of post-\n\n \n \n-App. 6a- \nemployment fringe benefits. Under the \u201cprior-panel-\nprecedent rule,\u201d we are required \u201cto follow the precedent \nof the first panel to address the relevant issue, unless and \nuntil the first panel\u2019s holding is overruled by the Court \nsitting en banc or by the Supreme Court.\u201d Scott v. United \nStates, 890 F.3d 1239, 1257 (11th Cir. 2018) (quotation \nmarks and citation omitted). And any later en banc or \nSupreme Court decisions must \u201cactually abrogate or \ndirectly conflict with, as opposed to merely weaken, the \nholding of the prior panel.\u201d United States v. Kaley, 579 \nF.3d 1246, 1255 (11th Cir. 2005). \nStanley argues that her claim is not barred by \nGonzales for three reasons. First, she points to a Supreme \nCourt case handed down shortly after Gonzales, which \nshe says calls into question our reasoning in Gonzales. \nSecond, she points to statutory changes in the text of the \nADA, which she says undermine the result in Gonzales. \nThird, she argues that Gonzales is distinguishable. We \nwill start by unpacking our reasoning in Gonzales, and \nthen address each argument in turn. \n1. \nGonzales was the first time we considered a former \nemployee\u2019s ability to sue under Title I. Timothy \nBourgeois, who suffered from AIDS, was fired from his \njob but kept receiving health insurance through his \nformer employer. Gonzales, 89 F.3d at 1524. About six \nmonths after the termination, Bourgeois\u2019s former \nemployer amended its health insurance plan by capping \nAIDS-related coverage. Id. In the time between that \namendment \nand \nBourgeois\u2019s \ndeath, \nhe \nincurred \nsignificant treatment costs for which he was denied \ncoverage. Id. at 1525. August Gonzales, the administrator \nof Bourgeois\u2019s estate, sued under Title I, alleging that the \n\n \n \n-App. 7a- \ninsurance plan amendment was unlawful disability \ndiscrimination. Id. at 1524. \nRelying on \u201cthe plain language of the ADA,\u201d we held \nthat Bourgeois (and thus his estate) had no viable Title I \nclaim \u201cbecause he neither held nor desired to hold a \nposition with [his former employer] at or subsequent to \nthe time the alleged discriminatory conduct was \ncommitted.\u201d Id. at 1526. That conclusion followed from the \ntext of Title I\u2019s anti-discrimination provision. It expressly \napplied only to \u201cqualified individual[s] with a disability\u201d \nwho \u201chold[]\u201d or \u201cdesire[]\u201d an \u201cemployment position.\u201d Pub. \nL. 101-336, \u00a7 101(8), 104 Stat. 331. We also relied on Title \nI\u2019s listed examples of discrimination, which mentioned \nonly \n\u201cqualified \nindividual[s] \nwith \na \ndisability,\u201d \n\u201capplicant[s],\u201d and \u201cemployee[s]\u201d as possible victims of \ndisability discrimination. Id. \u00a7 102(b)(1), 104 Stat. 332; see \nGonzales, 89 F.3d at 1526\u201327 & nn. 10\u201311. We explained \nthat each of these terms had an inherent temporal \nqualification: a qualified individual with a disability held \nor desired to hold a job when the discrimination occurred; \nan employee was \u201can individual employed by an \nemployer\u201d when the discrimination occurred; and an \napplicant, although not defined by Title I, was necessarily \nsomeone who had applied for a job when the \ndiscrimination occurred. Gonzales, 89 F.3d at 1526\u201327 \n(citation omitted). \nIn interpreting the ADA in Gonzales, we recognized \nthat other employment discrimination statutes, such as \nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, have been \nconstrued to protect former employees. See id. at 1527\u2013\n29. We noted, however, that the precedents adopting that \ninterpretation arose in the context of retaliation, not \ndiscrimination. See id. We found that distinction \n\n \n \n-App. 8a- \nimportant. As we had previously held, such a construction \nwas \u201cnecessary to provide meaning to anti-retaliation \nstatutory provisions and effectuate congressional intent.\u201d \nId. at 1529 (citing Bailey v. USX Corp., 850 F.2d 1506, \n1509 (11th Cir. 1998)). That is, by prohibiting retaliation, \na statute necessarily contemplated that it would apply to \nindividuals who accused a former employer of unlawful \nbehavior. See id. at 1529 n.14 (\u201c[W]e note that many \nretaliation claims are filed by former employees alleging, \nfor example, post-employment blacklisting.\u201d). So we \nendorsed a broad interpretation of anti-retaliation \nprovisions to avoid excluding an especially vulnerable \nclass of people from the statute\u2019s protection and thus \nundermining Congress\u2019s remedial scheme. \nWe explicitly declined to extend this reasoning to Title \nI discrimination claims in Gonzales. Title I\u2019s \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d definition, we said, was dispositive evidence \nthat \u201cCongress intended to limit the protection of Title I \nto either employees performing, or job applicants who \napply and can perform, the essential functions of available \njobs which their employers maintain.\u201d Id. at 1527. We \nconcluded that the plain language of Title I\u2019s anti-\ndiscrimination provision did not \u201cfrustrate the statute\u2019s \ncentral purpose\u201d\u2014i.e., protecting disabled people who can \nnevertheless perform the essential functions of a job\u2014the \nway that a \u201cliteral interpretation\u201d of other statutes\u2019 anti-\nretaliation provisions may have threatened to do. Id. at \n1528\u201329. Instead, to construe Title I to apply to former \nemployees would \u201cessentially render[] the [qualified \nindividual] requirement . . . meaningless.\u201d Id. at 1529. \nThus, after Gonzales, the rule in this circuit was \nsettled. To fall within Title I\u2019s anti-discrimination \nprovision, a plaintiff\u2019s claim must depend on an act \n\n \n \n-App. 9a- \ncommitted by the defendant while the plaintiff was either \nworking for the defendant or seeking to work for the \ndefendant. The result was that a former employee could \nnot sue for alleged discrimination in post-employment \nfringe benefits. \nThat settled rule was briefly disturbed five years later \nwhen a panel of this Court declared Gonzales overruled \nby intervening Supreme Court precedent. See Johnson v. \nK Mart Corp., 273 F.3d 1035 (11th Cir. 2001). The \nSupreme Court, in Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337 \n(1997), held that an individual could sue his or her former \nemployer under Title VII for a post-employment \nretaliatory act. The Johnson majority considered \nRobinson to be a decision of such magnitude that it \n\u201cmandate[d] the conclusion that Gonzales is no longer \ngood law and must be deemed overruled.\u201d Johnson, 273 \nF.3d at 1037. The Johnson majority then held that Title I \nprohibits discriminatory acts against current and former \nemployees alike. See id. \nBut Johnson\u2019s precedential life was short-lived. The \nopinion was vacated when this Court voted to rehear the \ncase en banc. Id. at 1070. K Mart later filed for \nbankruptcy, the parties settled, and the appeal was \ndismissed. See Johnson v. K Mart Corp., 281 F.3d 1368 \n(11th Cir. 2002) (en banc). Because of the bankruptcy and \nsettlement, we never issued an en banc opinion in \nJohnson. But the result of our en banc vacatur is that \nGonzales regained its status as this Court\u2019s governing \nprecedent on Title I\u2019s qualified individual requirement. \n2. \nWe now turn to Stanley\u2019s arguments. The centerpiece \nof Stanley\u2019s appeal is her request that we resurrect \nJohnson, ignore Gonzales, and hold that, after Robinson, \n\n \n \n-App. 10a- \nformer employees can sue under Title I for post-\nemployment \ndiscrimination. \nBut \nStanley \ngreatly \noverstates Robinson\u2019s impact. \u201cFor a Supreme Court \ndecision to undermine panel precedent to the point of \nabrogation, the decision must be clearly on point and \nclearly contrary to the panel precedent.\u201d Edwards v. U.S. \nAtt\u2019y Gen., 56 F.4th 951, 965 (11th Cir. 2022) (quotation \nmarks and citation omitted). This can happen \u201cwhere the \nSupreme Court has clearly set forth a new standard to \nevaluate\u201d a claim or issue. United States v. Archer, 531 \nF.3d 1347, 1352 (11th Cir. 2008). But Robinson did \nnothing of the sort. \nThe Supreme Court\u2019s holding in Robinson\u2014a Title \nVII retaliation case\u2014did not even upend our Title VII \nprecedents, much less our Title I caselaw. Long before \nRobinson, we had held that Title VII\u2019s anti-retaliation \nprovision allowed claims for post-employment retaliation. \nSee Gonzales, 89 F.3d at 1528\u201329. Robinson adopted the \nsame rule. But, in Gonzales, we distinguished Title I \ndiscrimination claims from our Title VII precedents based \non the different text of the ADA. Id. Because Robinson\u2019s \ninterpretation of Title VII did not change our Title VII \ncaselaw, it is hard to say it overruled our Title I caselaw. \nJudge Carnes said it best in his Johnson dissent: \u201cIt is a \nbit audacious . . . to say that a Supreme Court decision \nwhose holding was anticipated, acknowledged, and \nconsidered by a prior panel when deciding a different \nissue has undermined that prior panel\u2019s decision on the \ndifferent issue to such an extent that it may be \ndisregarded.\u201d Johnson, 273 F.3d at 1068 (Carnes, J., \ndissenting). \nLike its holding, Robinson\u2019s reasoning also does little \nto undermine Gonzales. Title VII\u2019s anti-retaliation \n\n \n \n-App. 11a- \nprovision at issue in Robinson applies to \u201cemployees.\u201d 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). Neither the statutory definition of \n\u201cemployees\u201d nor the anti-retaliation provision\u2019s specific \nuse of that term provides any \u201ctemporal qualifier.\u201d \nRobinson, 519 U.S. at 341\u201342. Looking to the rest of Title \nVII, the Robinson Court found that Title VII regularly \n\u201cuse[s] the term \u2018employees\u2019 to mean something more \ninclusive or different than \u2018current employees.\u2019\u201d Id. at 342. \nFor example, reinstatement is a Title VII remedy. Id. \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-5(g)(1), 2000e-16(b)). Because \n\u201cone does not \u2018reinstate\u2019 current employees,\u201d the \nRobinson Court reasoned that Title VII\u2019s remedial \nprovisions\u2019 use of \u201cemployees\u201d \u201cnecessarily refers to \nformer employees.\u201d Id. (brackets omitted). The term \n\u201cemployees\u201d in Title VII\u2019s anti-retaliation provision was, \ntherefore, ambiguous because it could be \u201cconsistent with \neither current or past employment.\u201d Id. \nTitle I\u2019s anti-discrimination provision is not afflicted \nwith any such ambiguity. There is a clear temporal \nqualifier in Title I: Only someone \u201cwho, with or without \nreasonable accommodation, can perform the essential \nfunctions of the employment position that such individual \nholds \nor \ndesires\u201d \nis \nprotected \nfrom \ndisability \ndiscrimination. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12111(8) (emphases added), \n12112(a); see also Slomcenski v. Citibank, N.A., 432 F.3d \n1271, 1280\u201381 (11th Cir. 2005). \u201cCan,\u201d \u201cholds,\u201d and \n\u201cdesires\u201d are in the present tense. So, to be a victim of \nunlawful disability discrimination, the plaintiff must \ndesire or already have a job with the defendant at the time \nthe defendant commits the discriminatory act. See \nMcKnight v. Gen. Motors Corp., 550 F.3d 519, 520 (6th \nCir. 2008); Weyer v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp., \n198 F.3d 1104, 1112 (9th Cir. 2000). And unlike Title VII\u2019s \nvaried use of \u201cemployees,\u201d Title I consistently uses the \n\n \n \n-App. 12a- \nterm \u201cqualified individual\u201d to refer to active employees or \ncurrent applicants. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12111(8), 12112(a)\u2013\n(b), 12114. \nWe acknowledge that the circuits are split. Our \nreading of Robinson aligns us with the Sixth, Seventh, and \nNinth Circuits. Each of those courts has held that (1) \nRobinson does not implicate Title I\u2019s anti-discrimination \nprovision and (2) Title I does not protect people who \nneither held nor desired a job with the defendant at the \ntime of discrimination. See McKnight, 550 F.3d at 522\u201328; \nMorgan v. Joint Admin. Bd., 268 F.3d 456, 457\u201359 (7th \nCir. 2001); Weyer, 198 F.3d at 1108\u201313. The Second and \nThird Circuits have held that Title I\u2019s anti-discrimination \nprovision is ambiguous, however, and have resolved that \npurported ambiguity in favor of former employees. See \nCastellano v. City of New York, 142 F.3d 58, 66\u201369 (2d Cir. \n1998); Ford v. Schering-Plough Corp., 145 F.3d 601, 604\u2013\n08 (3d Cir. 1998). \nWe are not convinced by Stanley\u2019s argument that we \nshould follow the Second and Third Circuits. The question \nwe are answering here is whether Robinson is so \ncompelling that it justifies ignoring a prior precedent. But \nneither the Second nor Third Circuit answered that \nquestion. Moreover, a review of those courts\u2019 decisions \nconvinces us that we are on the right side of the split. \nNeither court established that the text of Title I\u2019s anti-\ndiscrimination provision is ambiguous. Instead, the \nSecond and the Third Circuit expressed something \nbetween discomfort and disagreement with the policy \nchoice underlying the line, drawn by the text of the ADA, \nbetween disabled individuals who hold or desire to hold a \njob and those who do not. See Castellano, 142 F.3d at 67\u2013\n68; Ford, 145 F.3d at 605\u201306. But not \u201ceven the most \n\n \n \n-App. 13a- \nformidable policy arguments\u201d empower a court to ignore \nunambiguous text. BP P.L.C. v. Mayor & City Council of \nBaltimore, 141 S. Ct. 1532, 1542 (2021) (quotation marks \nand citation omitted). Nothing in Robinson, Castellano, or \nFord gives us a basis to ignore Gonzales. \n3. \nWe are also confident that Gonzales survived \nCongress\u2019s amendments to the ADA. Stanley points to \ntwo pieces of post-Gonzales legislation\u2014the ADA \nAmendments Act of 2008, Pub. L. 110-325, 122 Stat. 3553, \nand the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, Pub. L. 111-\n2, 123 Stat. 5\u2014and argues that because both acts \namended the ADA\u2019s text, we are free to, and should, \ndepart from Gonzales\u2019s interpretation of the original text \nof the ADA. It is of course true that when Congress \namends a statute, we need not follow decisions \ninterpreting discarded statutory language. But we \nconsider a prior precedent overruled by subsequent \nlegislation \nonly \nif \nthe \ncongressional \namendment \nrepresents \u201ca clear change in the law.\u201d Sassy Doll \nCreations, Inc. v. Watkins Motor Lines, Inc., 331 F.3d \n834, 840 (11th Cir. 2003) (citation omitted). Neither the \nADAAA nor the Fair Pay Act fits that bill. \nTurning first to the ADAAA, we cannot say that the \nADAAA upset Gonzales\u2019s interpretation of Title I\u2019s \nqualified individual definition. The ADAAA altered Title \nI\u2019s anti-discrimination provision. Where Title I originally \nsaid that employers could not \u201cdiscriminate against a \nqualified individual with a disability because of the \ndisability of such individual,\u201d Pub. L. 101-336, \u00a7 102(a), \n104 Stat. 331 (emphasis added), it now prohibits \ndiscrimination \u201cagainst a qualified individual on the basis \nof disability,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a) (emphasis added). But \n\n \n \n-App. 14a- \nthe definition of \u201cqualified individual\u201d\u2014someone who, \n\u201cwith or without reasonable accommodation\u201d is able \u201cto \nperform the essential functions of the employment \nposition that such individual holds or desires\u201d\u2014was \nmaterially unchanged by the ADAAA and remains in \neffect today. Compare Pub. L. 101-336, \u00a7 101(8), 104 Stat. \n331 with 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8); see Pub. L. 110-325, \u00a7 5(c), \n122 Stat. 3557 (striking \u201cwith a disability\u201d but otherwise \nleaving section 12111(8) as originally enacted). So the text \nupon which we relied in Gonzales is still the operative text \nin the statute. \nStanley contends that the result in Gonzales \nundermines Congress\u2019s purpose in adopting the ADAAA. \nThe purpose of the ADAAA, says Stanley, was to broaden \nthe scope of Title I. We have no doubt that is true; \nCongress said as much when passing the ADAAA. See \nPub. L. 110-325, \u00a7 2(a)\u2013(b), 122 Stat. 3553\u201354. But only the \nrare statute pursues its purpose to the exclusion of \neverything else. The ADAAA expanded Title I\u2019s \nprotections by expanding the mental and physical \nconditions that satisfy the statutory definition of \n\u201cdisability.\u201d See id. Nobody disputes that Stanley is \ndisabled. The issue here is whether Stanley was a \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d at the relevant point in time. And \nthe substance of the qualified individual standard, \nincluding the temporal qualifications, was unaffected by \nthe ADAAA. See Adair v. City of Muskogee, 823 F.3d \n1297, 1306\u201307 (10th Cir. 2016); Neely v. PSEG Tex., Ltd. \nP\u2019ship, 735 F.3d 242, 245\u201347 (5th Cir. 2013). \nSo too for the Fair Pay Act. To be sure, the Fair Pay \nAct effected a serious change in employment law. Before \nthe Fair Pay Act, discriminatory compensation claims \ngenerally accrued at only one point in time: when the \n\n \n \n-App. 15a- \ndiscriminatory compensation decision or practice was \nmade or adopted. See Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & \nRubber Co., Inc., 550 U.S. 618, 621 (2007). That rule posed \nserious statute of limitations problems for potential \nplaintiffs, who may not have even learned of the \ndiscriminatory compensation scheme until well after its \ninitial adoption. See id. at 649\u201350 (Ginsburg, J., \ndissenting). The Fair Pay Act reflects Congress\u2019s decision \nto relax the statute of limitations. Pub. L. 111-2. \u00a7 2(1)\u2013(2), \n123 Stat. 5. Now, a claim for discriminatory compensation \naccrues \u201cwhen a discriminatory compensation decision or \nother practice is adopted, when an individual becomes \nsubject to a discriminatory compensation decision or \nother practice, or when an individual is affected by \napplication of a discriminatory compensation decision or \nother practice . . . .\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A); see id. \u00a7 \n12117(a); Pub. L. 111-2, \u00a7 5(a), 123 Stat. 6 (stating that the \nFair Pay Act \u201cshall apply to claims of discrimination \nbrought under title I\u201d). \nThe Fair Pay Act made it easier to sue after \ndiscrimination\u2014as defined by Title I\u2014occurred. Cf. \nAT&T Corp. v. Hulteen, 556 U.S. 701, 713\u201316 (2009); \nMcReynolds v. Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc., 694 F.3d 873, \n888 (7th Cir. 2012). But, like the ADAAA, the Fair Pay Act \ndid not change the statutory language that we relied on in \nGonzales. Both before and after the Fair Pay Act, a Title \nI discrimination claim requires a plaintiff to show that he \nor she was a \u201cqualified individual\u201d who was subject to \ndiscriminatory \nterms, \nconditions, \nor \nbenefits \nof \nemployment. The Fair Pay Act\u2019s relaxed statute of \nlimitations helps a plaintiff only if that plaintiff otherwise \nhas a claim for discrimination. Because nothing in the Fair \nPay Act changes Title I\u2019s substantive requirements, \nGonzales is still binding precedent with respect to a \n\n \n \n-App. 16a- \nformer employee\u2019s ability to sue under Title I. \n4. \nBecause we hold that Gonzales is still good law, we \nmust ask whether Stanley was a disabled employee or job \napplicant capable of performing the job at the time of the \nalleged discrimination. There are three points in time in \nwhich Stanley can theoretically root her Title I claim: (1) \nin October 2003, when the City amended the benefits plan; \n(2) whenever she first became subject to the allegedly \ndiscriminatory provisions of the benefits plan as a \ndisabled employee; or (3) in December 2020, when she was \naffected by the termination of the health insurance \npremium payments. \nNeither option 1 nor option 3 works for Stanley. \nAlthough she was employed by the City in October 2003, \nshe concedes, and we agree, that her claim cannot turn on \nthe 2003 amendment to the benefits plan because she was \nnot yet disabled at that time. Although she was disabled \nat the time of the December 2020 termination of the health \ninsurance premium payments, that option doesn\u2019t work \nbecause, by that time, Stanley\u2019s relationship with the City \nwas as retiree, not employee. She did not hold or desire to \nhold, nor was she qualified to hold, an \u201cemployment \nposition\u201d with the City, as required by Title I\u2019s anti-\ndiscrimination provision and Gonzales. \nIn response to this reasoning, Stanley makes an \nargument similar to one advanced by the estate \nadministrator in Gonzales. She argues that she was a \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d in December 2020 and remains so \ntoday because the \u201c\u2018employment position\u2019 that [she] now \nholds is that of a retired employee . . . .\u201d But we rejected \nthat argument in Gonzales, refusing to recognize \u201cpost-\nemployment benefits recipient\u201d as a job. 89 F.3d at 1530. \n\n \n \n-App. 17a- \nIn light of Gonzales, we must reject Stanley\u2019s identical \nargument today. \nThe final option is that Stanley suffered discrimination \nas a disabled employee at some unknown point before she \nretired but after she was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s. \nStanley argued at oral argument that, while working for \nthe City in the two years after her Parkinson\u2019s diagnosis, \nthe writing was on the wall that she would need to take \ndisability retirement. So, the argument goes, the allegedly \ndiscriminatory benefits plan became a finalized term of \nher employment whenever disability retirement became a \nforegone conclusion. The upshot is that a completed claim \nof disability discrimination may have accrued while \nStanley was a qualified individual performing her duties \nas a firefighter. \nThis argument, if successful, would distinguish \nStanley\u2019s case from Gonzales, where the alleged \ndiscrimination occurred entirely after the employment \nrelationship had already terminated. But it would not \ndistinguish this case from decisions of the Sixth and Ninth \nCircuits. Those circuits have held that a Title I plaintiff \nmust be a qualified individual, not only at the time of \ndiscrimination, but also when the plaintiff files suit. See \nMcKnight, 550 F.3d at 528; Weyer, 198 F.3d at 1108\u201309. \nThe Sixth and Ninth Circuits are on our side of the split. \nSo, even though Stanley\u2019s argument is not foreclosed by \nour holding in Gonzales, there is some tension between \nthis argument and our reasoning in Gonzales. \nWe need not resolve this tension today because \nStanley waited too long to make this argument. In the \ndistrict court, Stanley\u2019s sole argument in support of her \nqualified individual status was that the Johnson majority \nwas correct, so the district court should ignore Gonzales. \n\n \n \n-App. 18a- \nBut Stanley did not try to distinguish her case from \nGonzales, essentially conceding that she loses if Gonzales \napplies. Then, in her initial brief on appeal, Stanley \naffirmatively conceded that \u201c[i]n this action, Ms. Stanley \ndoes not claim she was impacted by the discriminatory 24-\nmonth rule during her employment.\u201d The first time this \nargument appeared was in the United States\u2019 brief as \namicus curiae in this Court. We will not consider \narguments raised only by amici. Richardson v. Ala. State \nBd. of Educ., 935 F.2d 1240, 1247 (11th Cir. 1991). That \nrule is particularly appropriate where, as here, a party did \nnot make an argument to the district court and specifically \ndisclaimed the argument in its own brief. \nBecause Stanley cannot establish that the City \ncommitted any discriminatory acts against her while she \ncould perform the essential functions of a job that she held \nor desired to hold, her Title I claim fails. For the same \nreason, so do her claims under the Rehab Act and the \nFlorida Civil Rights Act. \nB. \nFinally, we turn to Stanley\u2019s claims under the Equal \nProtection Clause and Florida Statutes section 112.0801. \nThe district court concluded that the City was entitled to \nsummary judgment on both claims. We agree. \nThe City\u2019s benefits plan does not run afoul of the \nEqual Protection Clause. Disabled persons are not a \nsuspect class, and government-paid health insurance is \nnot a recognized fundamental right, so we scrutinize the \nCity\u2019s benefits plan under the lenient standard of rational \nbasis review. See City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., \n473 U.S. 432, 445\u201346 (1985); Morrissey v. United States, \n871 F.3d 1260, 1268 (11th Cir. 2017). We do not grade the \nwisdom of the City\u2019s decision. See Heller v. Doe, 509 U.S. \n\n \n \n-App. 19a- \n312, 319 (1993). If \u201cthere is any reasonably conceivable \nstate of facts that could provide a rational basis for the\u201d \nCity\u2019s decision, it will be upheld. Id. (citation omitted). The \nCity\u2019s benefits plan advances the legitimate governmental \npurpose of conserving funds. And its chosen method\u2014\ndecreasing the number of employees for whom the City \nsubsidizes health insurance\u2014is rationally related to that \nlegitimate purpose. So there is no equal protection \nproblem here. \nNeither does the City\u2019s benefits plan violate Florida \nStatutes section 112.0801. The statute requires that a \n\u201cmunicipality . . . that provides . . . health . . . insurance . . . \nfor its officers and employees and their dependents upon \na group insurance plan or self-insurance plan shall allow \nall [retired] personnel . . . the option of continuing to \nparticipate in the group insurance plan or self-insurance \nplan.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 112.0801(1). The health insurance must \nbe offered at the same \u201ccost applicable to active \nemployees,\u201d but \u201c[f]or retired employees . . . , the cost of \ncontinued participation may be paid by the employer or \nby the retired employees.\u201d Id. Stanley receives exactly \nwhat she is owed under the statute: the option to remain \non the City\u2019s health insurance plan. The statute does not \nrequire the City to pay Stanley\u2019s health insurance \npremiums. To the contrary, the statute grants the City \ndiscretion over whether to pay retirees\u2019 premiums. The \nCity cannot violate a statute by exercising the discretion \nspecifically granted by that statute. \nIV. \nThe judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. \n\n \n \n-App. 20a- \n \nAPPENDIX B \n \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nMIDDLE DISTRICT OF FLORIDA \nORLANDO DIVISION \n \nORDER \nTHIS CAUSE is before the Court on Defendant City \nof Sanford\u2019s Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 14) and Plaintiffs\u2019 \nResponse (Doc. 17) thereto.  \nI.

She was continuously employed in \nthat position until she was placed on disability retirement \non or about November 1, 2018, when she began to collect \nretirement benefits. (Id. \u00b6 16). Due to her disability, \nPlaintiff had no choice but to retire before she completed \nher full twenty-five years of service. (Id.). \nUntil September 20, 2003, Defendant paid the health \ninsurance premiums for its employees who retired after \ntwenty-five years of service and its employees who retired \non account of disability until they reached the age of 65. \n(Id. \u00b6 19). Defendant changed its policy on October 1, 2003, \nonly paying health insurance premiums for disabled \nretirees for twenty-four months following the effective \ndate of their disability retirement or their receipt of \nMedicare benefits, whichever came first. (Id. \u00b6 20). The \nchange did not apply to non-disabled retirees who \ncontinue to receive the benefit to age sixty-five. (Id. \u00b6 21). \nThe policy is a stand-alone fringe benefit of employment \nwith Defendant. (Id. \u00b6 23). It is not a part of the pension \nplan, nor the health insurance plan itself. (Id.). Policy \nSection 2.45(C), states in pertinent part: \nEmployees retiring for disability reasons and who \nmeet the criteria for disability retirement as \n\n \n \n-App. 22a- \nprescribed by the Florida Retirement System \n(F.R.S) or who meet the criteria for disability \nretirement as prescribed by the Police or Fire \nPension Plan are eligible for continued City-Paid \nhealth insurance. Effective October 1, 2003, with \nregard to all employees retiring as a result of full \ndisability and meet the criteria for disability \nretirement, City-Paid health insurance will begin \nupon retirement and will continue until the \ndisabled retiree receives Medicare benefits or until \n24 months have elapsed from the date of \nretirement, whichever comes first. \n(Id. \u00b6 24). Importantly, Plaintiff alleges that section \n112.0801(1), \nFlorida \nStatutes \nrequires \nmunicipal \nemployers such as Defendant to offer the same health \ninsurance coverage to retirees and their eligible \ndependents as is offered to active employees at a total \npremium cost of no more than the total premium cost \napplicable to active employees. (Id. \u00b6 17). Plaintiff alleges \nshe was wrongfully deprived of the equal benefit of \nreceiving health insurance until she reached age sixty-five \nbecause she has a disability. (Id. \u00b6 26). \nII. LEGAL STANDARD \n\u201cA pleading that states a claim for relief must contain \n\u2026 a short and plain statement of the claim showing that \nthe pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). \nPursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a \nparty may move to dismiss a complaint for \u201cfailure to state \na claim upon which relief can be granted.\u201d In determining \nwhether to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), a court accepts \nthe factual allegations in the complaint as true and \nconstrues them in a light most favorable to the non-\nmoving party. See United Techs. Corp. v. Mazer, 556 F.3d \n\n \n \n-App. 23a- \n1260, 1269 (11th Cir. 2009). Nonetheless, \u201cthe tenet that a \ncourt must accept as true all of the allegations contained \nin a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions,\u201d and \n\u201c[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, \nsupported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.\u201d \nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). Furthermore, \n\u201c[t]o survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain \nsufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim \nto relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Bell Atl. \nCorp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)). \u201cA claim has \nfacial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content \nthat allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that \nthe defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d Id. \nIII. DISCUSSION \nDefendant asks this Court to dismiss Plaintiff\u2019s \nComplaint as the allegations either fail as a matter of law \nor lack sufficient factual allegations to state a claim. \nPlaintiff responds that the law cited by Defendant is no \nlonger good law and that her claims are otherwise \nsufficiently pleaded.  \nA. Rehabilitation Act, ADA, and FCRA \nDefendant argues that Counts I, II, and III should be \ndismissed because Plaintiff has failed to present a prima \nfacie case of discrimination under each claim as she does \nnot qualify as an individual with a disability within the \nmeaning of the Rehabilitation Act, the ADA, and the \nFCRA because she was retired from her employment \nwhen the alleged discrimination occurred. Plaintiff \nresponds that she is qualified because the Acts protect \nformer employees who receive fringe benefits, not just \nthose currently employed. Because claims under the \nFCRA and the Rehabilitation Act must all meet the same \nstandard required to establish a claim under the ADA, \n\n \n \n-App. 24a- \nCounts I, II, and III will be analyzed together. See Boyle \nv. City of Pell City, 866 F.3d 1280, 1288 (11th Cir. 2017); \nMenzie v. Ann Taylor Retail Inc., 549 F. App\u2019x 891, 893\u2013\n94 & n.5 (11th Cir. 2013). \nThe ADA provides that \u201c[n]o covered entity shall \ndiscriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of \ndisability in regard to job application procedures, the \nhiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee \ncompensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, \nand privileges of employment.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a). \nLikewise, to establish a prima facie case of discrimination \nunder the Rehabilitation Act, Plaintiff, in addition to \nalleging Defendant receives federal funding, must allege \nthat (1) she had a disability; (2) she was otherwise qualified \nfor the job; and (3) she was subjected to unlawful \ndiscrimination as the result of her disability. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n794(a); Garrett v. Univ. of Ala. at Birmingham Bd. of Trs., \n507 F.3d 1306, 1310 (11th Cir. 2007). A qualified individual \nis defined as \u201can individual who, with or without \nreasonable accommodation, can perform the essential \nfunctions of the employment position that such individual \nholds or desires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8); see also Boyle, 866 \nF.3d at 1288 (finding that under the Rehabilitation Act \n\u201c[a] person with a disability is \u2018otherwise qualified\u2019 if he is \nable to perform the essential functions of the job in \nquestion with or without a reasonable accommodation\u201d). \nThe majority of courts, including the Eleventh Circuit \nin Gonzales v. Garner Food Servs., Inc., 89 F.3d 1523, 1531 \n(11th Cir. 1996), have held that a disabled former \nemployee has no standing to sue his former employer for \ndisability discrimination under the ADA or the \nRehabilitation Act based on actions that occurred after the \nemployment relationship ended. See, e.g., McKnight v. \n\n \n \n-App. 25a- \nGen. Motors Corp., 550 F.3d 519, 525\u201327 (6th Cir. 2008); \nMorgan v. Joint Admin. Bd., Ret. Plan of Pillsbury Co. & \nAm. Fed\u2019n of Grain Millers, 268 F.3d 456, 457\u201358 (7th Cir. \n2001); Weyer v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp., 198 \nF.3d 1104, 1110 (9th Cir. 2000); Smith v. Midland Brake, \nInc., 180 F.3d 1154, 1161\u201362 (10th Cir. 1999); Beauford v. \nFather Flanagan\u2019s Boys\u2019 Home, 831 F.2d 768, 771\u201372 (8th \nCir. 1987). The Second and Third Circuits, however, \nrelying on Robinson v. Shell Co., 519 U.S. 337 (1997), have \nheld that former employees are covered by Title I of the \nADA. See Castellano v. City of New York, 142 F.3d 58, 67\u2013\n69 (2d Cir. 1998); Ford v. Schering-Plough Corp., 145 F.3d \n601, 606\u201307 (3d Cir. 1999). \nPlaintiff insists that the Eleventh Circuit followed the \nSecond and Third Circuit\u2019s lead in Johnson v. K Mart \nCorp., 273 F.3d 1035 (11th Cir. 2001), vacated en banc, 273 \nF.3d 1070 (11th Cir. 2001), by overruling Gonzalez and \nholding that a former employee is entitled to bring a claim \nagainst his former employer under \u00a7 12112(a) of Title I of \nthe ADA. Yet, Gonzalez remains good law this Court is \nbound to follow because Johnson was subsequently \nvacated. See Jaffree v. Wallace, 705 F.2d 1526, 1533 (11th \nCir. 1983) (\u201cJudicial precedence serves as the foundation \nof our federal judicial system. Adherence to it results in \nstability and predictability.\u201d). \nPlaintiff\u2019s argument that Robinson constitutes an \nintervening case is unavailing. The Supreme Court\u2019s \ndecision in Robinson construed Title VII of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964, not a Title I claim under the ADA, and \nthe Title VII anti-retaliation provision does not require \nthe complainant to be a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d See Weyer, \n198 F.3d at 1112 (emphasizing that Title I, unlike the \nsection of Title VII at issue in Robinson, provides that \n\n \n \n-App. 26a- \n\u201c[n]o covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified \nindividual with a disability because of the disability of \nsuch individual\u201d (emphasis added) (quotation omitted)). \nTherefore, because Robinson is not squarely on point, it \ncannot be said to be an intervening case that directly \noverrules Gonzalez. See United States v. Chubbuck, 252 \nF.3d 1300, 1305 n.7 (11th Cir. 2001) (\u201cWe are not at liberty \nto disregard binding case law that is so closely on point \nand has been only weakened, rather than directly \noverruled, by the Supreme Court.\u201d (quotation omitted)); \nsee also Johnson, 273 F.3d at 1067 (Carnes, J., dissenting). \nCase in point, Bass v. City of Orlando, issued after \nRobinson had been decided, applied Gonzalez to conclude \nthat the ADA is limited to job applicants and current \nemployees capable of performing the essential functions \nof available jobs. 57 F. Supp. 2d 1318, 1323 (M.D. Fla. \n1999), aff\u2019d, 203 F. 3d 841 (11th Cir. 1999). Specifically, the \nCourt held that because the plaintiffs, disabled police \nofficers, did not assert that they were individually \ndiscriminated against during their employment, their \nclaims of discrimination did not accrue until they were \nawarded a line-of-duty disability pension. Id. at 1323\u201324. \nAt that time, the plaintiffs were unable to perform the \nessential functions of their jobs with or without reasonable \naccommodations. Id. at 1324. \nHere, Plaintiff has failed to allege that she was \n\u201cotherwise qualified,\u201d an allegation essential to her claims, \nand under the current law amendment would be futile \nbecause the alleged discrimination did not occur until \nPlaintiff was no longer able to perform the essential \nfunctions of her job. Thus, Counts I, II, and III will be \ndismissed with prejudice. \n\n \n \n-App. 27a- \nB. Declaratory Judgment Act \nIn Count IV Plaintiff seeks relief under the \nDeclaratory Judgment Act. Specifically, Plaintiff asks this \nCourt to declare that Policy Section 2.45(C) violates \nsection 112.0801(1), Florida Statutes, which requires \nmunicipal employers to offer the same health coverage to \nretirees as is offered to active employees. (Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 42\u2013\n52). \nDefendant argues, without any legal support, that \nPlaintiff\u2019s request for declaratory relief should be \ndismissed because she has not set forth the elements of \nher claim with requisite facts and the underlying policy \nmakes it clear that the difference in treatment is based on \nthe length of service, not disability. (Doc. 14 at 6). \nDefendant makes no effort to identify which facts are \nlacking. \nConclusory, vague, and unsupported arguments are \ndeemed waived and will not be considered by this Court. \nU.S. Steel Corp. v. Astrue, 495 F.3d 1272, 1287 n.13 (11th \nCir. 2007) (noting that the court need not consider \n\u201cperfunctory and underdeveloped\u201d arguments and that \nsuch arguments are waived). The Complaint sets forth the \nspecific policy and the specific statute and alleges how the \npolicy violates the statute. Accordingly, Defendant\u2019s \nmotion as to Count IV will be denied. \nC. Section 1983: Discrimination under ADA and \nRehabilitation Act \nNext, Defendant contends that Plaintiff\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim \nis due to be dismissed because Plaintiff failed to plead a \nviolation of both the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act and \ndid not identify a separate constitutional right allegedly \ninfringed upon. Defendant further insists that a claim is \n\n \n \n-App. 28a- \nnot viable where the only alleged deprivation is the \nemployee\u2019s rights created by the Rehabilitation Act and \nthe ADA. \nThe Complaint alleges that Defendant\u2019s \u201cintentional \nviolation of Plaintiff\u2019s clearly established statutory rights \nto be free from discrimination in the provision of benefits \nbased on her disability, under both the ADAA and the \nRehabilitation Act, \u2026 also violated [\u00a7] 1983.\u201d (Doc. 1, \u00b6 \n53). Plaintiff further alleges, without specificity, that \n\u201cDefendant\u2019s \nhealth \ninsurance \ncontinuation \npolicy \nviolated federal laws and deprived Plaintiff of rights \nprovided to her under the ADAA and [t]he Rehabilitation \nAct.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 56). \nA \u201cplaintiff may not maintain a section 1983 action in \nlieu of[\u2014]or in addition to[\u2014] a Rehabilitation Act or \nADA cause of action if the only alleged deprivation is of \nthe employee\u2019s rights created by the Rehabilitation Act \nand the ADA.\u201d Holbrook v. City of Alpharetta, 112 F.3d \n1522, 1531 (11th Cir. 1997). In other words, a \u00a7 1983 claim \nmust be based on a distinct violation of a constitutional \nright other than those set forth under the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act. See Wright v. City of Tampa, 998 F. \nSupp 1398, 1403\u201304 (M.D. Fla. 1998). As alleged, \nPlaintiff\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim is firmly founded on her rights \nunder the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. McNa v. \nCommc\u2019ns Inter-Local Agency, 551 F. Supp. 2d 1343, 1348 \n(M.D. Fla. 2008) (dismissing \u00a7 1983 claim because plaintiff \nmay not maintain a \u00a7 1983 claim to the extent that she \nbases claim on underlying violations of the ADA). Thus, \nCount V will be dismissed. Nevertheless, because it is not \nclear that amendment would be futile, Plaintiff will be \ngranted leave to amend this count to the extent that she \ncan correct the deficiencies noted herein. \n\n \n \n-App. 29a- \nD. Section 1983: Equal Protection Clause \nIn Count VI, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant violated \nthe Equal Protection Clause by classifying its disabled \nretirees as different from its \u201cother\u201d retirees without any \nrational relationship between the classification and any \nlegitimate governmental goal. (Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 58\u201360). Plaintiff \nalleges that Defendant has no legitimate governmental \nreason for having an insurance continuation policy that \ndiscriminates against its disabled retirees. (Id. \u00b6 61). \nDefendant argues that Plaintiff\u2019s Equal Protection claim \nfails because she has only asserted conclusory statements \nthat she was treated differently based on her disability \nand the policy clearly distinguishes based on years of \nservice. \n\u201cThe \nEqual \nProtection \nClause \nrequires \nthe \ngovernment to treat similarly situated persons in a similar \nmanner.\u201d Leib v. Hillsborough Cnty. Pub. Transp. \nComm\u2019n, 558 F.3d 1301, 1305\u201306 (11th Cir. 2009) (citation \nomitted). Therefore, in order to allege a claim under the \nEqual Protection Clause the complainant must include \nfactual \ndetail \nregarding \nthe \n\u201csimilarly \nsituated\u201d \nrequirement. Id.; see also Glenn v. Brumby, 632 F. Supp. \n2d 1308, 1314 (N.D. Ga. 2009) (\u201cClaims based on disparate \ntreatment under the equal Protection Clause must \ngenerally allege that (1) plaintiff is similarly situated with \nother persons who were treated differently; and (2) the \ndifference in treatment was based on a constitutionally \nprotected interest.\u201d). Significantly, the Equal Protection \nclause \nprotects \nindividuals \nwith \ndisability \nfrom \ndiscrimination. See City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living \nCtr., Inc., 473 U.S. 432, 446 (1985). Here, Plaintiff has \nalleged that disabled retirees are treated differently from \n\n \n \n-App. 30a- \nother retirees for no other reason than that they are \ndisabled. \nIn addition, Plaintiff must sufficiently allege that there \nis no rational basis for the disparate treatment. Glenn, 632 \nF. Supp. 2d at 1314. Indeed, \u201c[a] statute is presumed \nconstitutional and the burden is on the one attacking the \nlegislative arrangement to negative every conceivable \nbasis which might support it, whether or not the basis has \na foundation in the record.\u201d Heller v. Doe ex rel. Doe, 509 \nU.S. 312, 320\u201321 (1993) (quotations and citations omitted). \nDefendant, however, does not proffer a rational basis for \nthe distinction, nor does it argue dismissal is warranted \nbecause Plaintiff\u2019s Complaint fails to set forth facts that \nnegate any proffered rational basis. Rather, it merely \nargues that the distinction is based on years of service, a \nclaim that cannot be gleaned from the Complaint. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth herein, its ORDERED and \nADJUDGED as follows: \n1. Defendant\u2019s Motion (Doc. 14) is GRANTED in part. \nCounts I, II, and III of the Complaint (Doc. 1) are \nDISMISSED with prejudice and Count V is \nDISMISSED without prejudice. Defendant\u2019s Motion \nis otherwise DENIED. \n2. On or before March 8, 2021, Plaintiff may file an \namended complaint with respect Count V to correct \nthe deficiencies noted in this Order. Failure to timely \nfile an amended pleading in accordance with this Order \nmay result in the dismissal of Count V with prejudice \nand without further notice. \nDONE AND ORDERED in Orlando, Florida on March 1, \n2021.  \n\n \n \n-App. 31a- \n \n \n/s/ Wendy W.

The \nCity\u2019s reading would create an arbitrary regime in which \ndiscrimination becomes perfectly lawful the moment \nemployment ends\u2014just when benefits earned through \nyears of service finally kick in. It would drive a wedge \nbetween Title VII and the ADA. And it would give \nemployers a roadmap for implementing even the most \negregious animus-based discrimination\u2014of a kind that \nwould never be tolerated based on race or religion\u2014\nsimply by waiting until the day after retirement.  \nCongress didn\u2019t enact such a self-defeating scheme. \nJust as a city official with anti-Catholic animus can\u2019t cut \noff benefits on that basis (regardless of whether an \nemployee is Catholic while employed or later converts), \nthe ADA forbids such treatment on the basis of disability. \nI. As our opening brief demonstrates, and as the \nUnited States agrees, the ADA and the Fair Pay Act \ntogether provide that any person alleging discrimination \ncan sue (the \u201cwho\u201d), that the ADA covers retirement \nbenefits (the \u201cwhat\u201d), and that a person can sue when they \nare subjected to or affected by a discriminatory policy (the \n\u201cwhen\u201d). Thus, a plaintiff alleging discrimination in the \ndistribution of retirement benefits may sue at least where, \nas here, the policy existed prior to her retirement and she \nfeels the effects after retirement\u2014regardless of whether \nretirees are \u201cqualified individuals.\u201d  \nThe City doesn\u2019t respond to much of this legal \nframework. And the response it does offer tries mightily \nto dodge the question presented on case-specific grounds \n(which we address in Part III). When it finally gets to the \nstatute, the City proposes two atextual limits. First, it \n\n- 2 - \n \ncontends (at 18) that ADA plaintiffs must \u201chave a \ndisability\u201d when they are discriminated against\u2014even \nthough the ADA was amended to make clear that there\u2019s \nno such requirement, and even though Lt. Stanley did \nhave a disability before she retired. Second, the City \ncontends (at 25) that the Fair Pay Act applies only to \n\u201csecret\u201d compensation decisions\u2014even though the statute \nsays that it governs all practices \u201cwith respect to \ncompensation.\u201d Both of these arguments are at odds with \nthe text. Neither can salvage the judgment below.  \nII. Our opening brief also shows that the decision \nbelow erred in holding that retirees are not \u201cqualified \nindividuals.\u201d This is an independent ground for reversal\u2014\none that would also reach cases where (unlike here) \ndiscrimination occurs entirely after employment ends. \nThe City\u2019s main response (at 28\u201332) is that Congress \nunambiguously excluded retirees by using present-tense \nverbs. According to the City, when the statute asks if \nsomeone \u201ccan perform\u201d the functions of the position that \nshe \u201cholds or desires,\u201d it is requiring her to currently hold \nor desire a job. But this reading misses the definition\u2019s \nconditional nature. Like our hypothetical airline rule \nallowing boarding only for passengers who \u201ccan complete \nan x-ray screening of the luggage that such passenger \ncarries or checks,\u201d the definition tests capability only to \nthe extent that the predicate condition exists. Just as that \nrule doesn\u2019t exclude passengers who have no bags, the \ndefinition doesn\u2019t exclude those who no longer have a job. \nContext confirms this reading. The definition\u2019s role is \nto let employers make necessary job-related decisions, not \nto license arbitrary discrimination unrelated to job \nperformance. Other ADA provisions are specifically \nlimited to \u201capplicants or employees,\u201d showing that \nCongress knew how to exclude former employees when it \n\n- 3 - \n \nwanted to. These provisions would be superfluous if all \nqualified individuals had to currently hold or want jobs.  \nThe United States (at 29\u201331) offers another textual \npath to the same result: The ADA prohibits discrimination \nin \u201cemployee compensation,\u201d meaning payment for work \nas a qualified individual\u2014that is, for \u201cperform[ing] the \nessential functions of the employment position that [an] \nindividual holds.\u201d Applying logic similar to that employed \nby this Court in Davis v. Michigan, 489 U.S. 803, 808 \n(1989), \u201c[d]iscrimination in the compensation or other \nterms, conditions, or privileges a plaintiff earned as a \nqualified individual is\u201d thus \u201c\u2018discriminat[ion] against a \nqualified individual\u2019 within the meaning of Title I\u2014even if \nthat discrimination occurs only after the individual is no \nlonger employed.\u201d U.S. Br. 31. The City ignores Davis and \nis unable to explain why its logic doesn\u2019t apply here.  \nIII. Rather than face up to the interpretive and \npractical problems posed by its reading of the ADA, the \nCity tries to derail this Court\u2019s review by rehashing its \ncert-stage challenges to the particular discrimination \ncomplaint in this case. These arguments fall outside the \nquestion presented. And, at any rate, this case comes to \nthe Court on the assumption that Lt. Stanley adequately \nalleged her discrimination claim. U.S. Br. 26; Pet. App. 2a. \nThe City also resurfaces its waiver objections from the \nbrief in opposition. This Court necessarily considered and \nrejected those arguments when it granted certiorari, but \nregardless, as we have already explained, the City\u2019s \narguments lack merit. Pet. Br. 24\u201325; U.S. Br. 27\u201328. The \nCity\u2019s case-specific quibbles are therefore misplaced and \nprovide no sound basis for avoiding the issue at hand: Did \nCongress enact a scheme that affords protection for post-\nemployment benefits while ensuring that people can\u2019t \nactually enforce that protection? The answer is no. \n\n- 4 - \n \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe ADA and Fair Pay Act together permit \nformer employees to sue with respect to post-\nemployment benefits policies that were in effect \nwhile they were employed. \nOur opening brief demonstrates that, under the ADA \nand the Fair Pay Act, a plaintiff alleging discrimination in \nthe distribution of retirement benefits may sue at least \nwhere, as here, the policy existed prior to her \nretirement\u2014regardless of whether retirees are \u201cqualified \nindividuals.\u201d Pet. Br. 17\u201327; U.S. Br. 11\u201328. The City \nleaves much of this unaddressed. Once the City\u2019s \nprocedural objections about waiver and the like are set \naside, see Part III, infra, what remains are two legal \narguments directed at answering the question presented. \nNeither has merit.  \n1. The City\u2019s lead argument (at 18) is that the ADA \nprohibits discrimination only against individuals with a \ndisability. That argument is largely irrelevant here: As the \nEleventh Circuit recognized, Lt. Stanley\u2019s disability arose \nbefore her retirement, so she was an individual with a \ndisability while employed. Pet. App. 2a; U.S. Br. 21\u201322, 26. \nBut the City\u2019s argument is also just wrong. The ADA \nprohibits discrimination \u201cagainst a qualified individual on \nthe basis of disability.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a). This language \ntests the employer\u2019s conduct, not the individual\u2019s status. \nIndeed, the statute lists, as an example of prohibited \ndiscrimination, taking adverse actions against a non-\ndisabled person because of that person\u2019s association with \na disabled person. Id. \u00a7 12112(b)(4). The City\u2019s argument \nis incompatible with that provision. \nIt is also incompatible with the statute\u2019s history. The \nADA originally prohibited discrimination \u201cagainst a \n\n- 5 - \n \nqualified individual with a disability because of the \ndisability of such individual.\u201d Pub. L. No. 101\u2013336, Title \nI, \u00a7 102(a), 104 Stat. 327, 331 (1990) (emphasis added). But \nthe ADA Amendments Act of 2008 replaced that language \nwith the current phrasing to clarify that the discrimination \nneedn\u2019t be against someone with a disability so long as the \nemployer has discriminated \u201con the basis of disability.\u201d  \nTo require otherwise would undo that amendment. \n\u201cWhen Congress amends legislation, courts must \npresume it intends the change to have real and substantial \neffect\u201d\u2014not \u201cact[] as though the amendment \u2026 had not \ntaken place.\u201d Ross v. Blake, 578 U.S. 632, 641\u201342 (2016) \n(cleaned up); see also U.S. Br. 23. The petitioner (and the \nUnited States) offer readings that honor the statute\u2019s text \nand history; the City reads the amendment out entirely. \nIn response, the City puzzlingly points (at 20) to lower-\ncourt cases holding that the ADA amendments left the \nstatute\u2019s but-for causation standard unchanged. Resp. Br. \n20 (citing Akridge v. Alfa Ins. Cos., 93 F.4th 1181, 1192 \n(11th Cir. 2024)). But those cases are about the textual \nchange from \u201cbecause of the disability\u201d to \u201con the basis of \ndisability,\u201d not the elimination of the \u201cwith a disability\u201d \nlanguage at issue here. In fact, those cases confirm that \nthe broader goal of the reformulation was \u201cto decrease the \nemphasis on whether a person is disabled.\u201d Natofsky v. \nCity of N.Y., 921 F.3d 337, 350 (2d Cir. 2019). That\u2019s the \nopposite of what the City is arguing here.1 \n \n1 The City also tries to impose its disability requirement from \nanother angle, arguing (at 20\u201321) that because the 2008 amendments \nweren\u2019t retroactive, any claim \u201caccruing in 2003,\u201d when the City \nadopted its policy, would still have a \u201cdisability element.\u201d But as the \nUnited States explained (at 24 n.4), the 2008 amendments apply to any \nclaim that arises after 2008 and the Fair Pay Act tells us that claims \n \n\n- 6 - \n \n2. The City\u2019s only remaining argument is equally \natextual. According to the City, because the Fair Pay Act \noverruled Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 550 \nU.S. 618 (2007), that statute was intended to address only \nfact patterns like Ledbetter (where the discriminatory pay \ndecision was made, and kept, behind closed doors). In the \nCity\u2019s view (at 25), the statute thus applies only to \u201csecret \ndecisions\u201d about compensation.  \nWere that true, the statute\u2019s text would presumably \nreflect it. But nothing in the Fair Pay Act\u2019s text supports \nthis novel reading. Indeed, the City doesn\u2019t even mention \nthe text. Resp. Br. 25\u201326. That\u2019s because the text belies its \nclaim. Congress enacted an across-the-board rule that \napplies to all unlawful employment practices \u201cwith respect \nto discrimination in compensation.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-\n5(e)(3)(A). \nAnd, \nas \nthe \nCity \nconcedes \n(at \n47), \n\u201ccompensation\u201d \u201cinclude[s] retirement benefits.\u201d See \nAriz. Governing Comm. for Tax Deferred Annuity & \nDeferred Comp. Plans v. Norris, 463 U.S. 1073, 1079 \n(1983) (Marshall, J., joined by Brennan, White, Stevens, \nand O\u2019Connor, JJ.); see also Davis, 489 U.S. at 809 (\u201c\u2018[P]ay \nor compensation\u2019 includes retirement benefits.\u201d).  \nRather than ground its argument in the text, the City \nturns to policy. It speculates (at 26) that obeying the text \nwould encourage plaintiffs to \u201cdelay suit indefinitely.\u201d But \nthe Fair Pay Act only restarts the limitations period; it \ndoesn\u2019t eliminate it. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(B). So \neven if judges were free to rewrite statutes based on \npolicy, there\u2019s no reason why anyone would wait to sue \nover wrongly denied compensation. The Fair Pay Act thus \n \narise and accrue not only when a discriminatory policy is initially \nadopted, but also when a plaintiff is \u201csubject[ed] to\u201d and \u201caffected by\u201d \nit. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A). So retroactivity plays no role in this \ncase. \n\n- 7 - \n \napplies here just as it would in any other case respecting \n\u201cdiscrimination in compensation.\u201d \n3. Dispensing with these arguments is enough to \nresolve the question presented: A plaintiff alleging \ndiscrimination in the distribution of retirement benefits \nmay, at the very least, sue when those benefits are denied \npost-retirement to challenge an allegedly discriminatory \npolicy if that policy existed prior to her retirement.  \nThe City attempts to resist this outcome by trying to \nreframe this case as involving discrimination occurring \n\u201centirely post-employment.\u201d Resp. Br. 11, 14. But there\u2019s \nno dispute that the allegedly discriminatory policy was \nadopted and maintained while Lt. Stanley was employed. \nThat she did not suffer the financial effects until later \ndoesn\u2019t change the fact that the discrimination occurred \nboth before and after her retirement. The Fair Pay Act \nmakes this clear: Discrimination occurs when a policy \u201cis \nadopted,\u201d when someone \u201cbecomes subject to\u201d it, or when \nthey are \u201caffected by\u201d it. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A). Lt. \nStanley was qualified when the discriminatory policy was \nadopted, she became disabled while still employed and \nqualified, and she was affected by the discrimination when \nher benefits were reduced. This Court may therefore \nresolve this case on that ground alone.  \nII.  The ADA\u2019s \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition does \nnot permit employers to discriminate against \nretirees.  \nBecause retirees can sue when they feel the effects of \ndiscriminatory benefits policies adopted while they were \nworking, the Court need not reach the \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d definition. If it does, however, the Court should \nmake clear that employers are no more free to \ndiscriminate against former employees than current or \n\n- 8 - \n \nfuture ones. It is \u201cimplausible at best\u201d that Congress \nwould have prohibited discrimination with respect to \nretirement benefits but allowed discrimination against \nretirees. Davis, 489 U.S. at 810. Nothing in the definition\u2019s \ntext compels that unlikely result.  \nA.  The City\u2019s arguments highlight the need to \nconsider the definition\u2019s statutory context. \n1. The City\u2019s principal textual argument focuses on the \nthree present-tense verbs (\u201ccan,\u201d \u201cholds,\u201d and \u201cdesires\u201d) \nin the qualified-individual definition. The City insists (at \n28\u201330) that these verbs alone mean that the ADA \n\u201cunambiguous[ly]\u201d allows discrimination against retirees.  \nThat misreads the statute. The statutory text asks \nwhat an individual \u201ccan\u201d do, not what status they have. As \nour opening brief explains (at 42), applying the ordinary \nmeaning of \u201ccan\u201d and a basic principle of logic proves why \nthe definition\u2014even when read in isolation\u2014doesn\u2019t \nexclude retirees. \u201cCan perform\u201d means \u201cable to perform.\u201d \nSee Michael McCarthy & Ronald Carter, Cambridge \nGrammar of English: A Comprehensive Guide 185 (2006) \n(discussing modal phrases). And phrases of this kind are \nbinary: An individual either is (1) able to perform or (2) \nunable to perform. See Randolph Quirk, et. al., A \nComprehensive Grammar of the English Language 121 \n(2024). As with all binary tests, one who isn\u2019t in one bucket \nmust be in the other. See Bittner v. United States, 598 U.S. \n85, 93 (2023) (describing a \u201cstatutory obligation [as] \nbinary\u201d because one either does what the statute requires \nor \u201cdoes not\u201d). Because retirees are not unable to perform, \nthey are able to perform\u2014and therefore are qualified.   \n2. If that logic still sounds awkward as a matter of \n\u201cconversational conventions,\u201d Bostock v. Clayton Cnty., \n590 U.S. 644, 666 (2020), it\u2019s because in daily life we \n\n- 9 - \n \nrecognize that sentences like the \u201cqualified individual\u201d \ndefinition are implicitly conditional. Only if an individual \n\u201cholds\u201d or \u201cdesires\u201d a job must she be able to perform the \nfunctions of that job. Recall a few parallel examples: \n\u2022 \u201cA \u2018cleared passenger\u2019 means a passenger who can \ncomplete an x-ray screening of the luggage that \nsuch passenger carries or checks. Only \u2018cleared \npassengers\u2019 may board the aircraft.\u201d \n\u2022 \u201cYou must silence your cell phone to visit the \nlibrary.\u201d \nThese examples and others (at 35\u201340) show that the \nabsence of the assumed condition doesn\u2019t invariably mean \nthat a person cannot satisfy the rule. Instead, the rule \nturns on its \u201ccontent\u201d and \u201ccontext.\u201d Pet. Br. 45.  \nThe City\u2019s response just helps to make our point. After \nrewriting our hypothetical about phone usage at a movie \ntheater, the City explains (at 45) why its version of that \nrule doesn\u2019t protect people without phones: \u201cAt first blush, \nit may seem strange,\u201d the City says, but \u201c[t]he focus\u201d of \nthe rule is \u201con protecting people with cell phones.\u201d If one\u2019s \nintuition about the City\u2019s version of the rule is different, \nthat\u2019s only because the City explained its rule\u2019s broader \n\u201cconcern[s].\u201d As we conceded (at 43), \u201csome implicitly \nconditional rules that read like the \u2018qualified individual\u2019 \ndefinition might be naturally read in context as excluding \nthose who can\u2019t satisfy the condition.\u201d But the only way to \nknow how the rule works is to consider its context.  \nThe City purports (at 45\u201346) to have identified a \ndifferent unifying principle for interpreting implicitly \nconditional rules like these. The key, it says (at 44), is to \nask if the rule regulates the party to whom the implicit \ncondition applies or someone else. But that would-be \ninterpretive guide ultimately collapses into context, too. \nConsider one of our examples rewritten to regulate a third \n\n- 10 - \n \nparty (the airline) whose obligations turn on whether \nsomeone else (the passenger) can follow the rule:  \n\u2022 \u201cNo airline shall prohibit a \u2018cleared passenger\u2019 \nfrom boarding an airplane. A \u2018cleared passenger\u2019 \nmeans a passenger who can complete an x-ray \nscreening of the luggage that such passenger \ncarries or checks.\u201d Can airlines keep passengers \nwithout bags off their planes? Of course not. An \nordinary reader understands that the rule is \nconcerned with prohibiting dangerous luggage, \nnot limiting flights to people with luggage. \nFor good measure, recall that another one of our \nexamples (at 36) already was written (by Congress, in the \nU.S. Code) as the City says our examples need to be, \ntelling the NASA Administrator what she \u201cshall\u201d do vis-\u00e0-\nvis \u201camateur astronomers.\u201d  \n\u2022 \u201cThe [NASA] Administrator shall make one \nannual \naward\u201d \nto \n\u201c[t]he \namateur \nastronomer \u2026 who in the preceding calendar \nyear discovered the intrinsically brightest near-\nEarth asteroid.\u201d 51 U.S.C. \u00a7 30902(b)\u2013(c).  \u201cThe \nterm \u2018amateur astronomer\u2019 means an individual \nwhose employer does not provide any funding, \npayment, or compensation to the individual for \nthe observation of asteroids[.]\u201d Id. Surely \nunemployed astronomers are eligible; this rule \nrequires amateurism, not employment. \nAll these examples\u2014both ours and the City\u2019s\u2014point \nin the same direction: Context is everything. \n3. Recognizing the rule\u2019s implicit conditionality doesn\u2019t \ncreate \u201can unwritten exception\u201d to the \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d definition. Contra Resp. Br. 38\u201340. It simply \nrecognizes that, in a subset of cases, individuals are as \n\n- 11 - \n \nqualified as the definition requires\u2014exactly as written\u2014\nbecause the implicit condition isn\u2019t met.  \nThat Congress could have written the statute more \nclearly does not mean that our reading isn\u2019t the \u201cright and \nfair reading.\u201d Torres v. Lynch, 578 U.S. 452, 473 (2016). \nThe City itself arrives at its preferred rule only by \nrewriting the statute: It says (at 39) that Title I prohibits \ndiscrimination only \u201cagainst an individual who presently \nholds or desires a job that she can perform.\u201d That \nformul\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

The \nCity\u2019s reading would create an arbitrary regime in which \ndiscrimination becomes perfectly lawful the moment \nemployment ends\u2014just when benefits earned through \nyears of service finally kick in. It would drive a wedge \nbetween Title VII and the ADA. And it would give \nemployers a roadmap for implementing even the most \negregious animus-based discrimination\u2014of a kind that \nwould never be tolerated based on race or religion\u2014\nsimply by waiting until the day after retirement.  \nCongress didn\u2019t enact such a self-defeating scheme. \nJust as a city official with anti-Catholic animus can\u2019t cut \noff benefits on that basis (regardless of whether an \nemployee is Catholic while employed or later converts), \nthe ADA forbids such treatment on the basis of disability. \nI. As our opening brief demonstrates, and as the \nUnited States agrees, the ADA and the Fair Pay Act \ntogether provide that any person alleging discrimination \ncan sue (the \u201cwho\u201d), that the ADA covers retirement \nbenefits (the \u201cwhat\u201d), and that a person can sue when they \nare subjected to or affected by a discriminatory policy (the \n\u201cwhen\u201d). Thus, a plaintiff alleging discrimination in the \ndistribution of retirement benefits may sue at least where, \nas here, the policy existed prior to her retirement and she \nfeels the effects after retirement\u2014regardless of whether \nretirees are \u201cqualified individuals.\u201d  \nThe City doesn\u2019t respond to much of this legal \nframework. And the response it does offer tries mightily \nto dodge the question presented on case-specific grounds \n(which we address in Part III). When it finally gets to the \nstatute, the City proposes two atextual limits. First, it \n\n- 2 - \n \ncontends (at 18) that ADA plaintiffs must \u201chave a \ndisability\u201d when they are discriminated against\u2014even \nthough the ADA was amended to make clear that there\u2019s \nno such requirement, and even though Lt. Stanley did \nhave a disability before she retired. Second, the City \ncontends (at 25) that the Fair Pay Act applies only to \n\u201csecret\u201d compensation decisions\u2014even though the statute \nsays that it governs all practices \u201cwith respect to \ncompensation.\u201d Both of these arguments are at odds with \nthe text. Neither can salvage the judgment below.  \nII. Our opening brief also shows that the decision \nbelow erred in holding that retirees are not \u201cqualified \nindividuals.\u201d This is an independent ground for reversal\u2014\none that would also reach cases where (unlike here) \ndiscrimination occurs entirely after employment ends. \nThe City\u2019s main response (at 28\u201332) is that Congress \nunambiguously excluded retirees by using present-tense \nverbs. According to the City, when the statute asks if \nsomeone \u201ccan perform\u201d the functions of the position that \nshe \u201cholds or desires,\u201d it is requiring her to currently hold \nor desire a job. But this reading misses the definition\u2019s \nconditional nature. Like our hypothetical airline rule \nallowing boarding only for passengers who \u201ccan complete \nan x-ray screening of the luggage that such passenger \ncarries or checks,\u201d the definition tests capability only to \nthe extent that the predicate condition exists. Just as that \nrule doesn\u2019t exclude passengers who have no bags, the \ndefinition doesn\u2019t exclude those who no longer have a job. \nContext confirms this reading. The definition\u2019s role is \nto let employers make necessary job-related decisions, not \nto license arbitrary discrimination unrelated to job \nperformance. Other ADA provisions are specifically \nlimited to \u201capplicants or employees,\u201d showing that \nCongress knew how to exclude former employees when it \n\n- 3 - \n \nwanted to. These provisions would be superfluous if all \nqualified individuals had to currently hold or want jobs.  \nThe United States (at 29\u201331) offers another textual \npath to the same result: The ADA prohibits discrimination \nin \u201cemployee compensation,\u201d meaning payment for work \nas a qualified individual\u2014that is, for \u201cperform[ing] the \nessential functions of the employment position that [an] \nindividual holds.\u201d Applying logic similar to that employed \nby this Court in Davis v. Michigan, 489 U.S. 803, 808 \n(1989), \u201c[d]iscrimination in the compensation or other \nterms, conditions, or privileges a plaintiff earned as a \nqualified individual is\u201d thus \u201c\u2018discriminat[ion] against a \nqualified individual\u2019 within the meaning of Title I\u2014even if \nthat discrimination occurs only after the individual is no \nlonger employed.\u201d U.S. Br. 31. The City ignores Davis and \nis unable to explain why its logic doesn\u2019t apply here.  \nIII. Rather than face up to the interpretive and \npractical problems posed by its reading of the ADA, the \nCity tries to derail this Court\u2019s review by rehashing its \ncert-stage challenges to the particular discrimination \ncomplaint in this case. These arguments fall outside the \nquestion presented. And, at any rate, this case comes to \nthe Court on the assumption that Lt. Stanley adequately \nalleged her discrimination claim. U.S. Br. 26; Pet. App. 2a. \nThe City also resurfaces its waiver objections from the \nbrief in opposition. This Court necessarily considered and \nrejected those arguments when it granted certiorari, but \nregardless, as we have already explained, the City\u2019s \narguments lack merit. Pet. Br. 24\u201325; U.S. Br. 27\u201328. The \nCity\u2019s case-specific quibbles are therefore misplaced and \nprovide no sound basis for avoiding the issue at hand: Did \nCongress enact a scheme that affords protection for post-\nemployment benefits while ensuring that people can\u2019t \nactually enforce that protection? The answer is no. \n\n- 4 - \n \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe ADA and Fair Pay Act together permit \nformer employees to sue with respect to post-\nemployment benefits policies that were in effect \nwhile they were employed. \nOur opening brief demonstrates that, under the ADA \nand the Fair Pay Act, a plaintiff alleging discrimination in \nthe distribution of retirement benefits may sue at least \nwhere, as here, the policy existed prior to her \nretirement\u2014regardless of whether retirees are \u201cqualified \nindividuals.\u201d Pet. Br. 17\u201327; U.S. Br. 11\u201328. The City \nleaves much of this unaddressed. Once the City\u2019s \nprocedural objections about waiver and the like are set \naside, see Part III, infra, what remains are two legal \narguments directed at answering the question presented. \nNeither has merit.  \n1. The City\u2019s lead argument (at 18) is that the ADA \nprohibits discrimination only against individuals with a \ndisability. That argument is largely irrelevant here: As the \nEleventh Circuit recognized, Lt. Stanley\u2019s disability arose \nbefore her retirement, so she was an individual with a \ndisability while employed. Pet. App. 2a; U.S. Br. 21\u201322, 26. \nBut the City\u2019s argument is also just wrong. The ADA \nprohibits discrimination \u201cagainst a qualified individual on \nthe basis of disability.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a). This language \ntests the employer\u2019s conduct, not the individual\u2019s status. \nIndeed, the statute lists, as an example of prohibited \ndiscrimination, taking adverse actions against a non-\ndisabled person because of that person\u2019s association with \na disabled person. Id. \u00a7 12112(b)(4). The City\u2019s argument \nis incompatible with that provision. \nIt is also incompatible with the statute\u2019s history. The \nADA originally prohibited discrimination \u201cagainst a \n\n- 5 - \n \nqualified individual with a disability because of the \ndisability of such individual.\u201d Pub. L. No. 101\u2013336, Title \nI, \u00a7 102(a), 104 Stat. 327, 331 (1990) (emphasis added). But \nthe ADA Amendments Act of 2008 replaced that language \nwith the current phrasing to clarify that the discrimination \nneedn\u2019t be against someone with a disability so long as the \nemployer has discriminated \u201con the basis of disability.\u201d  \nTo require otherwise would undo that amendment. \n\u201cWhen Congress amends legislation, courts must \npresume it intends the change to have real and substantial \neffect\u201d\u2014not \u201cact[] as though the amendment \u2026 had not \ntaken place.\u201d Ross v. Blake, 578 U.S. 632, 641\u201342 (2016) \n(cleaned up); see also U.S. Br. 23. The petitioner (and the \nUnited States) offer readings that honor the statute\u2019s text \nand history; the City reads the amendment out entirely. \nIn response, the City puzzlingly points (at 20) to lower-\ncourt cases holding that the ADA amendments left the \nstatute\u2019s but-for causation standard unchanged. Resp. Br. \n20 (citing Akridge v. Alfa Ins. Cos., 93 F.4th 1181, 1192 \n(11th Cir. 2024)). But those cases are about the textual \nchange from \u201cbecause of the disability\u201d to \u201con the basis of \ndisability,\u201d not the elimination of the \u201cwith a disability\u201d \nlanguage at issue here. In fact, those cases confirm that \nthe broader goal of the reformulation was \u201cto decrease the \nemphasis on whether a person is disabled.\u201d Natofsky v. \nCity of N.Y., 921 F.3d 337, 350 (2d Cir. 2019). That\u2019s the \nopposite of what the City is arguing here.1 \n \n1 The City also tries to impose its disability requirement from \nanother angle, arguing (at 20\u201321) that because the 2008 amendments \nweren\u2019t retroactive, any claim \u201caccruing in 2003,\u201d when the City \nadopted its policy, would still have a \u201cdisability element.\u201d But as the \nUnited States explained (at 24 n.4), the 2008 amendments apply to any \nclaim that arises after 2008 and the Fair Pay Act tells us that claims \n \n\n- 6 - \n \n2. The City\u2019s only remaining argument is equally \natextual. According to the City, because the Fair Pay Act \noverruled Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 550 \nU.S. 618 (2007), that statute was intended to address only \nfact patterns like Ledbetter (where the discriminatory pay \ndecision was made, and kept, behind closed doors). In the \nCity\u2019s view (at 25), the statute thus applies only to \u201csecret \ndecisions\u201d about compensation.  \nWere that true, the statute\u2019s text would presumably \nreflect it. But nothing in the Fair Pay Act\u2019s text supports \nthis novel reading. Indeed, the City doesn\u2019t even mention \nthe text. Resp. Br. 25\u201326. That\u2019s because the text belies its \nclaim. Congress enacted an across-the-board rule that \napplies to all unlawful employment practices \u201cwith respect \nto discrimination in compensation.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-\n5(e)(3)(A). \nAnd, \nas \nthe \nCity \nconcedes \n(at \n47), \n\u201ccompensation\u201d \u201cinclude[s] retirement benefits.\u201d See \nAriz. Governing Comm. for Tax Deferred Annuity & \nDeferred Comp. Plans v. Norris, 463 U.S. 1073, 1079 \n(1983) (Marshall, J., joined by Brennan, White, Stevens, \nand O\u2019Connor, JJ.); see also Davis, 489 U.S. at 809 (\u201c\u2018[P]ay \nor compensation\u2019 includes retirement benefits.\u201d).  \nRather than ground its argument in the text, the City \nturns to policy. It speculates (at 26) that obeying the text \nwould encourage plaintiffs to \u201cdelay suit indefinitely.\u201d But \nthe Fair Pay Act only restarts the limitations period; it \ndoesn\u2019t eliminate it. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(B). So \neven if judges were free to rewrite statutes based on \npolicy, there\u2019s no reason why anyone would wait to sue \nover wrongly denied compensation. The Fair Pay Act thus \n \narise and accrue not only when a discriminatory policy is initially \nadopted, but also when a plaintiff is \u201csubject[ed] to\u201d and \u201caffected by\u201d \nit. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A). So retroactivity plays no role in this \ncase. \n\n- 7 - \n \napplies here just as it would in any other case respecting \n\u201cdiscrimination in compensation.\u201d \n3. Dispensing with these arguments is enough to \nresolve the question presented: A plaintiff alleging \ndiscrimination in the distribution of retirement benefits \nmay, at the very least, sue when those benefits are denied \npost-retirement to challenge an allegedly discriminatory \npolicy if that policy existed prior to her retirement.  \nThe City attempts to resist this outcome by trying to \nreframe this case as involving discrimination occurring \n\u201centirely post-employment.\u201d Resp. Br. 11, 14. But there\u2019s \nno dispute that the allegedly discriminatory policy was \nadopted and maintained while Lt. Stanley was employed. \nThat she did not suffer the financial effects until later \ndoesn\u2019t change the fact that the discrimination occurred \nboth before and after her retirement. The Fair Pay Act \nmakes this clear: Discrimination occurs when a policy \u201cis \nadopted,\u201d when someone \u201cbecomes subject to\u201d it, or when \nthey are \u201caffected by\u201d it. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A). Lt. \nStanley was qualified when the discriminatory policy was \nadopted, she became disabled while still employed and \nqualified, and she was affected by the discrimination when \nher benefits were reduced. This Court may therefore \nresolve this case on that ground alone.  \nII.  The ADA\u2019s \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition does \nnot permit employers to discriminate against \nretirees.  \nBecause retirees can sue when they feel the effects of \ndiscriminatory benefits policies adopted while they were \nworking, the Court need not reach the \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d definition. If it does, however, the Court should \nmake clear that employers are no more free to \ndiscriminate against former employees than current or \n\n- 8 - \n \nfuture ones. It is \u201cimplausible at best\u201d that Congress \nwould have prohibited discrimination with respect to \nretirement benefits but allowed discrimination against \nretirees. Davis, 489 U.S. at 810. Nothing in the definition\u2019s \ntext compels that unlikely result.  \nA.  The City\u2019s arguments highlight the need to \nconsider the definition\u2019s statutory context. \n1. The City\u2019s principal textual argument focuses on the \nthree present-tense verbs (\u201ccan,\u201d \u201cholds,\u201d and \u201cdesires\u201d) \nin the qualified-individual definition. The City insists (at \n28\u201330) that these verbs alone mean that the ADA \n\u201cunambiguous[ly]\u201d allows discrimination against retirees.  \nThat misreads the statute. The statutory text asks \nwhat an individual \u201ccan\u201d do, not what status they have. As \nour opening brief explains (at 42), applying the ordinary \nmeaning of \u201ccan\u201d and a basic principle of logic proves why \nthe definition\u2014even when read in isolation\u2014doesn\u2019t \nexclude retirees. \u201cCan perform\u201d means \u201cable to perform.\u201d \nSee Michael McCarthy & Ronald Carter, Cambridge \nGrammar of English: A Comprehensive Guide 185 (2006) \n(discussing modal phrases). And phrases of this kind are \nbinary: An individual either is (1) able to perform or (2) \nunable to perform. See Randolph Quirk, et. al., A \nComprehensive Grammar of the English Language 121 \n(2024). As with all binary tests, one who isn\u2019t in one bucket \nmust be in the other. See Bittner v. United States, 598 U.S. \n85, 93 (2023) (describing a \u201cstatutory obligation [as] \nbinary\u201d because one either does what the statute requires \nor \u201cdoes not\u201d). Because retirees are not unable to perform, \nthey are able to perform\u2014and therefore are qualified.   \n2. If that logic still sounds awkward as a matter of \n\u201cconversational conventions,\u201d Bostock v. Clayton Cnty., \n590 U.S. 644, 666 (2020), it\u2019s because in daily life we \n\n- 9 - \n \nrecognize that sentences like the \u201cqualified individual\u201d \ndefinition are implicitly conditional. Only if an individual \n\u201cholds\u201d or \u201cdesires\u201d a job must she be able to perform the \nfunctions of that job. Recall a few parallel examples: \n\u2022 \u201cA \u2018cleared passenger\u2019 means a passenger who can \ncomplete an x-ray screening of the luggage that \nsuch passenger carries or checks. Only \u2018cleared \npassengers\u2019 may board the aircraft.\u201d \n\u2022 \u201cYou must silence your cell phone to visit the \nlibrary.\u201d \nThese examples and others (at 35\u201340) show that the \nabsence of the assumed condition doesn\u2019t invariably mean \nthat a person cannot satisfy the rule. Instead, the rule \nturns on its \u201ccontent\u201d and \u201ccontext.\u201d Pet. Br. 45.  \nThe City\u2019s response just helps to make our point. After \nrewriting our hypothetical about phone usage at a movie \ntheater, the City explains (at 45) why its version of that \nrule doesn\u2019t protect people without phones: \u201cAt first blush, \nit may seem strange,\u201d the City says, but \u201c[t]he focus\u201d of \nthe rule is \u201con protecting people with cell phones.\u201d If one\u2019s \nintuition about the City\u2019s version of the rule is different, \nthat\u2019s only because the City explained its rule\u2019s broader \n\u201cconcern[s].\u201d As we conceded (at 43), \u201csome implicitly \nconditional rules that read like the \u2018qualified individual\u2019 \ndefinition might be naturally read in context as excluding \nthose who can\u2019t satisfy the condition.\u201d But the only way to \nknow how the rule works is to consider its context.  \nThe City purports (at 45\u201346) to have identified a \ndifferent unifying principle for interpreting implicitly \nconditional rules like these. The key, it says (at 44), is to \nask if the rule regulates the party to whom the implicit \ncondition applies or someone else. But that would-be \ninterpretive guide ultimately collapses into context, too. \nConsider one of our examples rewritten to regulate a third \n\n- 10 - \n \nparty (the airline) whose obligations turn on whether \nsomeone else (the passenger) can follow the rule:  \n\u2022 \u201cNo airline shall prohibit a \u2018cleared passenger\u2019 \nfrom boarding an airplane. A \u2018cleared passenger\u2019 \nmeans a passenger who can complete an x-ray \nscreening of the luggage that such passenger \ncarries or checks.\u201d Can airlines keep passengers \nwithout bags off their planes? Of course not. An \nordinary reader understands that the rule is \nconcerned with prohibiting dangerous luggage, \nnot limiting flights to people with luggage. \nFor good measure, recall that another one of our \nexamples (at 36) already was written (by Congress, in the \nU.S. Code) as the City says our examples need to be, \ntelling the NASA Administrator what she \u201cshall\u201d do vis-\u00e0-\nvis \u201camateur astronomers.\u201d  \n\u2022 \u201cThe [NASA] Administrator shall make one \nannual \naward\u201d \nto \n\u201c[t]he \namateur \nastronomer \u2026 who in the preceding calendar \nyear discovered the intrinsically brightest near-\nEarth asteroid.\u201d 51 U.S.C. \u00a7 30902(b)\u2013(c).  \u201cThe \nterm \u2018amateur astronomer\u2019 means an individual \nwhose employer does not provide any funding, \npayment, or compensation to the individual for \nthe observation of asteroids[.]\u201d Id. Surely \nunemployed astronomers are eligible; this rule \nrequires amateurism, not employment. \nAll these examples\u2014both ours and the City\u2019s\u2014point \nin the same direction: Context is everything. \n3. Recognizing the rule\u2019s implicit conditionality doesn\u2019t \ncreate \u201can unwritten exception\u201d to the \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d definition. Contra Resp. Br. 38\u201340. It simply \nrecognizes that, in a subset of cases, individuals are as \n\n- 11 - \n \nqualified as the definition requires\u2014exactly as written\u2014\nbecause the implicit condition isn\u2019t met.  \nThat Congress could have written the statute more \nclearly does not mean that our reading isn\u2019t the \u201cright and \nfair reading.\u201d Torres v. Lynch, 578 U.S. 452, 473 (2016). \nThe City itself arrives at its preferred rule only by \nrewriting the statute: It says (at 39) that Title I prohibits \ndiscrimination only \u201cagainst an individual who presently \nholds or desires a job that she can perform.\u201d That \nformulation both reorders the definition and adds the \nword \u201cpresently.\u201d While the statute written by the City \nmay indeed require an individual to hold or desire a job, \nthe statute written by Congress does not.  \nB. The statutory context confirms that retirees \nare not excluded from protection.  \nBecause everyone agrees that context matters, the \nreal question is what role it plays here. The \u201cstatutory \ncontext, structure, and purpose all strongly indicate\u201d \n(U.S. Br. 32) that retirees are qualified individuals. \nNothing the City says suggests otherwise.  \n1. The City concedes (at 47) that the ADA prohibits \ndiscrimination in retirement benefits. That prohibition is \nan important \u201ctextual and structural clue[]\u201d that \nretirees\u2014who use those benefits\u2014aren\u2019t categorically \nexcluded from the Act\u2019s coverage. Niz-Chavez v. Garland, \n593 U.S. 155, 160 (2021).  \nThis \nCourt\u2019s \ndecision \nin \nDavis \nv. \nMichigan \nDepartment of Treasury, 489 U.S. 803 (1989), points up \nthe unlikeliness that Congress excluded retirees from \nTitle I\u2019s coverage. Because \u201cretirement benefits are \ndeferred compensation for past years of service \nrendered,\u201d the Court in Davis deemed it \u201cimplausible at \nbest\u201d that a statute prohibiting discrimination in \n\n- 12 - \n \n\u201ccompensation\u201d would somehow allow discrimination \nagainst retirees. Id. at 808\u201310. So too here. \n2. The qualified-individual definition\u2019s role in the \nstatutory scheme supplies additional, crucial context. The \nCity argues (at 33) that the purpose of the definition is to \nidentify who deserves the Act\u2019s protections: those who can \n\u201cpresently work.\u201d Its only support for that conclusion is a \nsingle legislative finding that notes the costs of excluding \npeople with disabilities from the workforce.  \nThere\u2019s no dispute that one purpose of the ADA is to \nprevent the exclusion of people with disabilities from the \nworkforce. But the statute serves that purpose with or \nwithout the qualified-individual provision. And the City\u2019s \nreading of that provision\u2014under which employers can \ndiscriminate against people with disabilities, so long as \nthey wait until a worker retires\u2014would undermine the \nvery purpose the City claims it serves. See Main St. All. \nBr. 6; AARP Br. 19. \nAs we explain in our opening brief (at 30\u201332), the \npurpose of the qualified-individual provision is not to \nlicense post-employment disability discrimination. As its \ntext makes clear, the provision\u2019s purpose is to ensure that \nemployers need not hire, accommodate, or retain \nindividuals who \u201ccan[\u2019t] perform the essential functions of \nthe \nemployment \nposition.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 12111(8). \nAuthorizing employers to discriminate when \u201cdol[ing] \nout\u201d benefits that are \u201cpart and parcel of the employment \nrelationship\u201d does nothing to advance this purpose. \nHishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U.S. 69, 75 (1984). \nIndeed, the Act specifically addresses the employer\u2019s need \nto account for disability when designing a benefits plan by \nconsidering \u201cunderwriting risks\u201d and \u201cclassifying risks.\u201d \n\n- 13 - \n \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12201(c).2 While that provision allows \nemployers to take those legitimate needs into account, it \nexpressly prohibits using a benefits plan \u201cas a subterfuge \nto evade the purposes\u201d of the statute. Id.  \n3. Contrary to the City\u2019s assertion (at 42), our reading \ndoesn\u2019t render any of the Act\u2019s provisions superfluous. In \nclaiming that it does, the City points to Section \n12112(b)(5)(A), which allows employers to decline to make \nreasonable accommodations when doing so \u201cwould impose \nan undue hardship on the operation of the business.\u201d The \nCity claims that this provision would be unnecessary if \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d allowed employers to refuse to hire \npeople who are unable to perform a given job. But as this \nCourt explained in US Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. \n391, 398 (2002), the undue-hardship provision excuses \nemployers from accommodating employees who \u201ccan \nperform the essential functions of the\u201d employment \nposition with reasonable accommodations if doing so \nwould cause an undue hardship. On any reading, then, the \nundue-hardship provision isn\u2019t duplicative of the qualified-\nindividual provision; it provides additional discretion. So \ntoo with the other employer-accommodating provisions \nthe City identifies, each of which deals with a specific \nproblem not addressed by the \u201cqualified individual\u201d \nprovision. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(6) (addressing \nselection criteria and employment tests).  \nThe City\u2019s interpretation, on the other hand, renders \nimportant language in the construction provision \nsuperfluous. That provision says that employers need only \nmake reasonable accommodations to a \u201cqualified \n \n2 This provision answers the concern expressed by the City\u2019s \namici that, unless employers can freely discriminate in the \ndistribution of post-employment benefits, they will be unable to make \nnecessary changes to benefits plans. See, e.g., Chamber Br. 18\u201320. \n\n- 14 - \n \nindividual with a disability who is an applicant or \nemployee.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A) (emphasis added). \nIf all qualified individuals \u201chold[]\u201d or \u201cdesire[]\u201d jobs, there \nwould have been no need for that italicized language.  \nThe City doesn\u2019t argue otherwise. Instead, it points \nout (at 43) that other \u201cconstruction\u201d provisions also limit \ntheir reach to \u201capplicant[s] or employee[s].\u201d But that just \nmeans that its interpretation renders even more of the Act \nsuperfluous. The City argues that Congress was merely \n\u201cemphasiz[ing] how important it was \u2026 that a plaintiff \nhave an actual, present relationship with an employer.\u201d Id. \nThat kind of argument can always be made in favor of \ninterpretations that render language superfluous, and the \nCity\u2019s too-much-surplusage argument runs counter to \nhow the rule normally works. See Fischer v. United States, \n603 U.S. 480, 496 (2024) (\u201csurplusage is \u2026 disfavored\u201d and \na \u201cconstruction that creates substantially less of it is \nbetter than a construction that creates substantially \nmore\u201d). Regardless, the City ignores that still other \n\u201cconstruction\u201d provisions describe prohibited forms of \ndiscrimination without mentioning \u201capplicant[s] or \nemployee[s]\u201d at all. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(3). \n4. The City\u2019s attempt to rely on the statute\u2019s anti-\nretaliation provision\u2014which appears among various \n\u201cmiscellaneous\u201d provisions, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12201\u201312213, not \nin Title I\u2014fares no better. The City argues (at 37) that \nthis provision\u2014which forbids discrimination \u201cagainst any \nindividual,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12203(a)\u2014shows that \u201cwhen \nCongress wanted to prohibit discrimination against \ndisabled former employees, it did so clearly and \nexplicitly.\u201d  \nNot so. First, using \u201cany individual\u201d in Title I would \nhave radically changed the statute in ways that have \nnothing to do with retirees (forcing employers to hire \n\n- 15 - \n \nindividuals \nwho \ncannot \ndo \nthe \njob \neven \nwith \naccommodations). And second, the use of \u201cany individual\u201d \nin the retaliation provision has nothing to do with retirees, \neither. The ADA\u2019s retaliation provision applies to each \nchapter of the Act, not just Title I, see 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 12203(a), and Title III of the ADA (which isn\u2019t about \nemployment) \nprohibits \ndiscrimination \nagainst \nany \n\u201cindividual,\u201d id. \u00a7 12182(a). The retaliation provision is \ndrafted to cover those cases, not retirees. \n5. Turn next to the ADA\u2019s stated purposes, which \ninclude \u201cprovid[ing] a clear and comprehensive national \nmandate for the elimination of discrimination against \nindividuals with disabilities,\u201d and \u201cprovid[ing] clear, \nstrong, consistent, enforceable standards addressing \ndiscrimination against individuals with disabilities.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(b). Ours is the only \u201cpermissible\u201d \ninterpretation of the \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition that \n\u201cproduces a substantive effect that is compatible with\u201d \nthose stated purposes and \u201cthe rest of the law.\u201d United \nSav. Ass\u2019n of Tex. v. Timbers of Inwood Forest Assocs., \nLtd., 484 U.S. 365, 371 (1988). \nThe City never disputes that, under its interpretation, \nan employer motivated by nothing but the desire to \n\u201cintentional[ly] exclu[de]\u201d need only wait until the day \nafter retirement to strip disabled employees of benefits. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(a)(5). The City\u2019s explanation for this \nsurprising result (at 50\u201351) is that Congress thought other \nremedies already addressed discrimination against \nretirees. This reasoning rests on two flawed premises. \nThe first (at 50) is that Title I\u2019s only concern was \nproviding \u201ca legal remedy for disabled workers that did \nnot previously exist.\u201d That\u2019s unlikely; as this Court has \nrepeatedly explained, \u201clegislative enactments\u201d addressing \nemployment discrimination \u201chave long evinced a general \n\n- 16 - \n \nintent to accord parallel or overlapping remedies against \ndiscrimination.\u201d Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., \n415 U.S. 36, 47 (1974); see also N. Haven Bd. of Ed. v. Bell, \n456 U.S. 512, 536 n.26 (1982). There\u2019s no reason to think \nTitle I is any different.  \nThe second (at 51) is that it was \u201cclear\u201d when Congress \nenacted the ADA that there were other remedies for \ndisabled retirees. The City and its amici rely heavily on \nERISA. But ERISA\u2019s anti-discrimination provision \nwasn\u2019t enacted until 1996\u2014six years after the ADA. See \nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of \n1996, Pub. L. No. 104\u2013191, 110 Stat. 1936 (codified as \namended at 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182). And ERISA\u2019s remedies are \nmore limited than Title I\u2019s. Compare 29 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B) \n(recovery \nlimited \nto \n\u201cbenefits \ndue \u2026 under the terms of [the] plan), and Mertens v. \nHewitt Assocs., 508 U.S. 248, 255 (1993) (no compensatory \nor punitive damages available under section 502(a)(3) of \nERISA), \nwith \n42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1981a(a)(2) \n(authorizing \ncompensatory and punitive damages in most Title I suits).  \nBecause ERISA doesn\u2019t apply to state or local \ngovernments, it also would do nothing for public \nemployees after retirement. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1002(32), \n1003(b). That coverage gap is significant. Post-\nemployment benefits are a major draw for many critical \npublic service jobs. See AARP Br. 19 n.27. And the Equal \nProtection Clause is no safe haven. Governments that are \nable to rationalize (even post-hoc) the exclusion of disabled \nretirees on any basis other than animus will almost \ncertainly survive rational-basis review. See City of \nCleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 442 (1985).  \nNor do state-law contractual remedies fill the gap. An \nemployer that contractually retains discretion over \ncontinued payment may stop those payments for any \n\n- 17 - \n \nreason. See Disability Rts. Legal Ctr. Br. 22 (noting that \nemployers \u201croutinely reserve for themselves the right to \nchange their benefit plans\u201d). And, unlike an ADA plaintiff, \na retiree bringing a contractual claim\u2014likely seeking to \nrecover amounts that attorneys\u2019 fees would far outpace\u2014\ngenerally can\u2019t recover those fees.  \n6. The City offers a handful of other reasons why it \nthinks that Title I doesn\u2019t apply to retirees. None is \npersuasive. Our understanding of the statute does not, as \nthe City suggests (at 40), \u201ccreate bizarre incentives for \nemployees.\u201d The hypothetical it concocts\u2014in which an \nemployee who is \u201ctotally incapable of performing a certain \nposition\u201d and who \u201cdoesn\u2019t apply for [a] promotion or \notherwise indicate that she \u2018desires\u2019 it\u201d sues when she \ndoesn\u2019t get promoted\u2014plainly isn\u2019t actionable.  \nNor can the City brush away (at 30\u201332, 48\u201349) the \nteachings of Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337 (1997). \nRobinson is relevant not for specific statutory text, but for \nits methodology: It demonstrates how to interpret terms \nin employment discrimination laws whose \u201cbroader \ncontext\u201d favors one reading over another. Id. at 345.  \nAnd Robinson itself is part of that \u201cbroader context.\u201d \n\u201cThe central prohibitions of the ADA are all taken, \ndirectly or indirectly, from Title VII.\u201d Pamela S. Karlan & \nGeorge Rutherglen, Disabilities, Discrimination, and \nReasonable Accommodation, 46 Duke L.J. 1, 5 (1996). To \nbe sure, the reasonable-accommodation requirement \ncomes from the Rehabilitation Act. See id. at 7. But much \nof the discriminatory \u201cbehavior forbidden\u201d by Title I is \n\u201cborrowed virtually intact from the language of Title VII \nand case law\u201d interpreting it. Id. at 5. And when Congress \namended Title I in 2008, it did so \u201cto mirror the structure \nof [the] nondiscrimination protection provision in Title \nVII.\u201d 154 Cong. Rec. S8840-01 (daily ed. Sept. 16, 2008).  \n\n- 18 - \n \nIII. This Court should ignore the City\u2019s misplaced \nattempts to derail the Court\u2019s consideration of \nthe question presented.  \nThis Court granted certiorari to consider a purely \nlegal question about whether and when former employees \ncan challenge allegedly discriminatory post-employment \nbenefits policies. In an effort to dodge that question, the \nCity complains extensively of waiver and attempts to \nlitigate the adequacy of Lt. Stanley\u2019s discrimination \ncomplaint. Resp. Br. 1\u20132, 7\u20138, 16\u201318, 22\u201323.  \nThe City aired these issues in opposing certiorari, and \nthis Court is presumed to have \u201cnecessarily considered \nand rejected\u201d them. Stolt-Nielsen S.A. v. AnimalFeeds \nInt\u2019l Corp., 559 U.S. 662, 670 n.2 (2010). Indeed, this Court \ncouldn\u2019t have missed them: The City began and ended its \nopposition with these exact arguments. BIO 1\u20132, 30\u201331. \nThe City offers no sound reason to revisit them now.  \n1. Nor have the City\u2019s waiver arguments improved. Lt. \nStanley raised below the same core arguments that she \noffers here. See Pet. Br. 24\u201325; U.S. Br. 27\u201328. Her \nopening \nbrief \nbelow \nexpressly \nincorporated \nthe \ngovernment\u2019s argument that, under the Fair Pay Act, she \nmay challenge allegedly discriminatory acts that occurred \nwhile she was employed. Pet. C.A. Br. at viii\u2013ix; Pet. C.A. \nReply Br. 4\u20136; see Fed. R. App. P. 28(i) (\u201c[A]ny party may \nadopt by reference a part of another\u2019s brief.\u201d); United \nStates v. Eshetu, 898 F.3d 36, 37 n.1 (D.C. Cir. 2018) \n(allowing adoption of amicus arguments under Rule 28(i)). \nAnd for her own part, Lt. Stanley\u2019s opening brief below \nexplained that, because she didn\u2019t feel the impact of the \nCity\u2019s policy until retirement, she would have been unable \nto bring this claim in the absence of the Fair Pay Act. Pet. \nC.A. Br. 20. She would have lacked Article III standing to \nrecover damages if she had brought it when employed, but \n\n- 19 - \n \nbeen barred by the statute of limitations if she brought it \nwhen the subsidy was cut off. Id. The Fair Pay Act, she \nargued (analogizing to Goldilocks), allowed her to thread \nthe needle based on the same underlying conduct\u2014the \nCity\u2019s allegedly unlawful policy. Id.3  \n2. The same goes for the City\u2019s \u201cdisclaimer\u201d argument \n(at 15\u201316), which it ties to Lt. Stanley\u2019s acknowledgment \nthat she would have lacked Article III standing to sue \nwhen the City adopted its discriminatory policy in 2003 \nbecause she was not yet disabled. As the government \nexplains, it would be a mistake to confuse this \u201cstatement \nabout standing as a concession on the merits.\u201d U.S. Br. 25 \nn.5. Acknowledging that she lacked standing to challenge \nthe policy before experiencing its effects isn\u2019t remotely \nequivalent to conceding away her rights under the statute. \n3. Finally, the City tries to derail review by rehashing \nits case-specific attacks on Lt. Stanley\u2019s discrimination \ncomplaint from its cert-stage opposition. Resp. Br. 22\u201323. \nThese attacks fall outside the question presented. Pet. \nCert. Reply 3. This Court\u2019s Rule 14.1(a) is clear: \u201cOnly the \nquestions set out in the petition, or fairly included therein, \nwill be considered by the Court.\u201d See, e.g., 14 Penn Plaza \nLLC v. Pyett, 556 U.S. 247, 273 (2009). And, as the United \nStates explains, \u201c[t]his case comes to the Court on the \nassumption that Stanley \u2026 has adequately alleged that \nthe City\u2019s policy facially discriminate[d] \u2018on the basis of \ndisability.\u2019\u201d U.S. Br. 16\u201317. It likewise \u201ccomes to the Court \n \n3 As the City acknowledges (at 18), \u201ca party can make any \nargument in support of [a] claim\u201d and is \u201cnot limited to the precise \narguments they made below.\u201d Lebron v. Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp., \n513 U.S. 374, 379 (1995). The City never contends, nor could it, that \nLt. Stanley is advancing a new claim in this Court. See U.S. Br. 28 n.6 \n(explaining that Lt. Stanley\u2019s arguments support her \u201cconsistent \nclaim\u201d that her status as a former employee does not preclude her \nfrom challenging the City\u2019s policy). \n\n- 20 - \n \non the assumption that Stanley has adequately alleged \nthat the City acted with discriminatory intent not only in \nadopting the allegedly discriminatory benefits policy in \n2003, but also in maintaining that policy throughout the \nrest of her employment\u2014including the period after she \nwas diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease in 2016, during \nwhich it eventually became apparent that Stanley would \nbe forced to take disability retirement.\u201d U.S. Br. 26.4  \nThe City attempts (at 7\u20138, 22\u201323) to challenge these \nassumptions. But this Court addresses issues subsidiary \nto the question presented only if the question \u201ccannot \ngenuinely be answered\u201d otherwise. Richlin Sec. Serv. Co. \nv. Chertoff, 553 U.S. 571, 579 n.4 (2008). That\u2019s not the case \nhere. The petition \u201ctook as a given\u201d that Lt. Stanley \nadequately alleged her underlying discrimination case. \nSmith v. Arizona, 602 U.S. 779, 801 (2024). The City\u2019s \ncase-specific attacks on Lt. Stanley\u2019s complaint are \u201cnot \nnow fit for [this Court\u2019s] resolution\u201d and form \u201cno part of \nthe question [the Court] agreed to review.\u201d Chiaverini v. \nCity of Napoleon, 602 U.S. 556, 565 (2024). The City will \nof course be free to raise these arguments, and whatever \ndefenses it chooses, on remand.  \n \n4 The complaint makes clear that Lt. Stanley was disabled while \nshe was employed. It alleges that, given the \u201cphysical demands and \nrequirements of a Firefighter position\u201d and \u201cher physical disability,\u201d \nshe \u201cdid not have a choice but to retire due to her disability.\u201d Compl. \n\u00b6 16. The court of appeals itself recognized that Lt. Stanley \u201cmanaged \nto continue working as a firefighter for about two more years\u201d after \nher Parkinson\u2019s diagnosis, after which \u201cher disease and accompanying \nphysical disabilities left her incapable of performing her job.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 2a. The City\u2019s brief in opposition never contended otherwise. See \nS. Ct. R. 15.2 (\u201cAny objection to consideration of a question presented \nbased on what occurred in the proceedings below, if the objection does \nnot go to jurisdiction, may be deemed waived unless called to the \nCourt\u2019s attention in the brief in opposition.\u201d).  \n\n- 21 - \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe court of appeals\u2019 judgment should be reversed. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nDEEPAK GUPTA  \n \nCounsel of Record \nERIC F.

That issue is whether discrimination \noccurring entirely post-employment against totally \ndisabled former employees, is actionable under Title I \nof the ADA. The Eleventh Circuit, joining the majority \nof courts, correctly held that Title I unambiguously \nprohibits discrimination solely against an individual \nwho \u201ccan perform\u201d the job she presently \u201cholds or \ndesires.\u201d Thus, it concluded that because Petitioner \ncould not establish that the City committed any \ndiscriminatory acts against her while she could \nperform the essential functions of a job that she held \nor desired to hold, her Title I claim failed. \nIn Part I of her brief, Petitioner raises an \nargument that she not only failed to press below, but \nthat she expressly disclaimed. She untimely argues \nshe \nwas \ndiscriminated \nagainst \nduring \nher \nemployment when she was a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d \nHowever, she conceded in her initial brief below that \nshe could not have brought these claims while she was \nstill employed and able to do her job because she would \nhave lacked standing. The Eleventh Circuit properly \ndeclined to decide her opposite position untimely \nraised for the first time in her reply brief.  \nThis Court \u201cdoes not \u2018[o]rdinarily...decide in the \nfirst instance issues not decided below.\u2019\u201d City of \nAustin, Texas v. Reagan Nat'l Advert. of Austin, LLC, \n596 U.S. 61, 76 (2022). Therefore, Petitioner\u2019s \ncontention that this Court \u201cneed not reach\u201d the circuit-\nsplit question and should reverse on the issue she \ndisclaimed, should be rejected. This Court should only \n\n2 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nconsider the circuit-split question. But to the extent \nthis Court reviews the question not pressed or passed \nupon, it should find that Petitioner\u2019s unpreserved \nclaims of discrimination during employment are \nunpled and time-barred. The Ledbetter Act has no \nplace here to save her waived claims allegedly \naccruing two decades ago.  \nPetitioner incorrectly claims that the Eleventh \nCircuit held that a disabled retired firefighter may be \nsubjected to discrimination with impunity. It said \nnothing of the sort. And \u201c[i]t seems more than \nuncharitable to say,\u201d Kincaid v. Williams, 143 S. Ct. \n2414, 2418 (2023) (Alito, J., dissenting), that the court \nof appeal\u2019s finding of an unambiguous limitation on \nTitle I\u2019s prohibitions is the same as finding that a \nretiree \u201cmay be subjected to discrimination with \nimpunity.\u201d  \nThe Eleventh Circuit also did not hold that former \nemployees can never sue under Title I regarding post-\nemployment benefits. It held that discrimination \noccurring during employment against a \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d is actionable under the ADA. And for \nalleged discrimination post-employment, there are \nnumerous remedies under other federal and state \nlaws. Thus, Petitioner\u2019s claims failed, not for lack of \nremedy or an incorrect interpretation of the ADA, but \nbecause of her allegations and litigation strategy. This \nCourt should affirm.  \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent statutory provisions are reproduced in \nthe appendix to this brief.  \n\n3 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Statutory Background \n1. In enacting the Americans with Disabilities \nAct, Congress found, in part, that \u201csociety has tended \nto isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(a)(2). Congress enacted Title I of the \nADA to provide legal remedies for discrimination \nagainst disabled workers that did not previously exist. \nSee 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(a)(4). At the time, several other \nfederal statutes existed for the protection of employee \nretirement benefits such as ERISA and the Social \nSecurity Act. The Equal Protection Clause provided an \nadditional remedy for public employees. See Tennessee \nv. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 522 (2004) (\u201cemphasiz[ing] that \nthe House and Senate Committee Reports on the ADA \nfocused on \u2018[d]iscrimination [in]...employment in the \nprivate sector,\u2019 and made no mention of discrimination \nin public employment.\u201d) (emphasis added by the \nCourt). \nThis Court has also \u201cidentified Title I\u2019s purpose as \nenforcement of the Fourteenth Amendment's [equal \nprotection] command that \u2018all persons similarly \nsituated should be treated alike.\u2019\u201d Id. Thus, except as \nto the ADA\u2019s requirement that employers provide \n\u201creasonable accommodations\u201d for the disabled, 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A), the essence of the ADA is \nequal\u2014not preferential\u2014treatment for the disabled. \nSee Williams v. United Ins. Co. of Am., 253 F.3d 280, \n282 (7th Cir. 2001) (an \u201cemployer is not required to \ngive the disabled employee preferential treatment.\u201d). \n\u201cThe ADA requires only that persons with disabilities \nhave the opportunity to receive the same benefits as \nnon-disabled officers who have given an equivalent \n\n4 \n\u0003\n\u0003\namount of service.\u201d Castellano v. City of New York, 142 \nF.3d 58, 70 (2d Cir. 1998). \n2. The ADA\u2019s prohibition against discrimination \nin employment is codified in Title I: \n(a) General rule. No covered entity shall \ndiscriminate \nagainst \na \nqualified \nindividual on the basis of disability in \nregard to job application procedures, \nthe hiring, advancement, or discharge \nof employees, employee compensation, \njob \ntraining, \nand \nother \nterms, \nconditions, \nand \nprivileges \nof \nemployment. \n \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a) (emphasis added). The term of art \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d is incorporated into the general \nrule and defines the class of individuals protected by \nits prohibition against discrimination: \n \nThe term \u201cqualified individual\u201d means an \nindividual \nwho, \nwith \nor \nwithout \nreasonable accommodation, can perform \nthe essential functions of the employment \nposition that such individual holds or \ndesires. \n \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8). \u201cThe determination of whether a \nperson is qualified should be made at the time of the \nemployment action, e.g. hiring or promotion...\u201d H.R. \nRep. No. 101\u2013485(III), at 34 (1990).  \n \n3. While Title I \u201cborrows much of its procedural \nframework from [T]itle VII,\u201d it \u201cborrows much of its \n\n5 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nsubstantive framework from Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973.\u201d Id. at 31. The \u201cconcept\u201d of \na \u201cqualified individual\u201d comes from \u201cthe regulations \nimplementing...the Rehabilitation Act\u201d\u2014not from \nTitle VII. Id. at 33; see also Alexander v. Choate, 469 \nU.S. 287, 309 (1985) (no unlawful discrimination \nfound under the Rehabilitation Act because the state's \npolicy was \u201cneutral on its face\u201d and it \u201cmade the same \nbenefit...equally accessible to both handicapped and \nnonhandicapped persons\u2026\u201d). \nB. Factual Background \n1. Because Petitioner argues that the Eleventh \nCircuit erred in affirming the dismissal of her ADA \nclaim at the pleading stage, the facts should be taken \nfrom her complaint only. Petitioner\u2019s statement of the \nfacts, however, largely draws from the evidence \ndeveloped at the summary judgment stage on her \nEqual Protection Clause claim. The pertinent factual \nallegations from her complaint are as follows.  \nPetitioner alleged that when she was hired in \n1999, the City \u201cpaid for health insurance for its \nemployees who retired after 25 years of service and its \nemployees who retired on account of disability\u201d until \n\u201cthe age of 65.\u201d Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 13, 19. In 2018, she accepted \na disability retirement because she was completely \nunable to perform her duties as a firefighter due to an \nunidentified \u201cphysical disability.\u201d Id. \u00b6 16. \nFifteen years before she retired, the City changed \nits policy in 2003 to require all retirees to complete 25 \nyears\u2019 service to earn the subsidy to age 65. See id. \u00b6\u00b6 \n19, 24. But the change still treated disability retirees \nbetter than similarly situated non-disabled retirees \n\n6 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nwith less than 25 years because while the latter \nreceived nothing, the former received the subsidy for \n24 months or until their receipt of Medicare benefits, \nwhichever came first. Id. \u00b6 24.  \nPetitioner, however, did not sue the City for \nbreach of an employment contract or bring an \nunconstitutional takings claim based on the change. \nThus, Petitioner\u2019s statement that the City \u201cpromised\u201d \nher the benefits under the defunct policy from 15 years \nbefore \nshe \nretired, \nis \nfactually \nand \nlegally \nunsupported. Pet. Br. 11. Petitioner only had a vested \nright to benefits under a policy \u201cin effect at the time\u201d \nof her retirement. City of Hollywood v. Bien, 209 So. \n3d 1, 3 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2016). \nWhile Petitioner claims the policy change was \nmade \u201cquietly,\u201d Pet. Br. 10, her complaint actually \nalleges a public announcement of the policy because it \nwas \u201ccodified in City Policy Section 2.45(c)\u201d of its \nordinances, and in its \u201cofficial personnel policies.\u201d Doc. \n1, \u00b6 24; see also Doc. 38-10 at 2-5; Doc. 38-11 at 4. Her \ncomplaint does not allege that she was unaware of the \npersonnel policy or the ordinance at the time of its \npassage or when she retired.  \nBecause she was totally disabled and unable to \nwork, Petitioner retired early with only 20 years\u2019 \nservice instead of the 25 required to earn the subsidy \nto age 65. Doc. 1, \u00b6 16. Her complaint did not allege \nwhen she became disabled or that she continued to \nwork thereafter as a \u201cqualified individual\u201d with a \ndisability before she retired. Petitioner only alleged \nthat because of a \u201cphysical disability\u201d she took a \ndisability retirement in November 2018 and as a \nresult, the City\u2019s subsidy policy would be applied to \n\n7 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nher, and she would lose the subsidy in November of \n2020\u201424 months after her retirement date. Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 \n16, 26.  \n2. Petitioner erroneously claims that the City\u2019s \nsubsidy \npolicy \ndistinguished \nbetween \n\u201cnormal \nretirees\u201d and disabled retirees. Pet. Br. 11.1 However, \nthe phrase \u201cnormal retiree\u201d appears nowhere in the \nordinance. See Doc. 38-10 at 2-5. Rather, the ordinance \nshows that any retiree, disabled or non-disabled, with \n25 years of service is eligible for the subsidy to age 65. \nDoc. 38-10 at 4, \u00b6 2.45(C), (G). The ordinance did not \ncondition the subsidy to age 65 on a \u201cnormal \nretirement\u201d because under the City\u2019s pension plan, a \n\u201cnormal retirement\u201d could be taken after only ten (10) \nyears of service. Doc. 39-17 at 27; J.A. 35, n. 2.  \nPetitioner, like everyone else, was eligible to \nreceive the full subsidy so long as she served 25 years. \nHowever, in 2018, she requested and was awarded a \n\u201cdisability retirement\u201d with only 20 years of service. \nDoc. 38-5.2 But even though she failed to fulfill the \nservice-based criteria, the City, out of compassion, \nprovided 24 months of the subsidy to its totally \ndisabled retirees who retired early short of 25 years. \nDoc. 38-10 at 4, \u00b6 2.45(C), (F), (G); J.A. 34-35, 40; Doc. \n38 at 21-22. Uncoincidentally, 24 months is exactly \nhow long it takes before a totally disabled retiree like \nPetitioner is eligible to receive Medicare benefits. See \nMedicare Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 426(b)(2)(A), 1395o(a)(1). \n\u0003\n1 Petitioner cites to Doc. 39-16 for this proposition but omits key \nlanguage from that document which shows that the policy was \nbased solely on years of service and not a \u201cnormal\u201d retirement.  \n2 Petitioner insinuates that she was disabled \u201cin the line of duty.\u201d \nPet. Br. 1, 11. The record shows she was not. Doc. 38-5. \n\n8 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nSimilarly situated, non-disabled retirees with only 20 \nyears\u2019 service received no subsidy at all and they are \nnot Medicare eligible because they are not disabled. \nDoc. 38-10 at 4, \u00b6 2.45(C); J.A. 34-35, 44. Thus, far \nfrom treating Petitioner worse because of her \ndisability than her non-disabled co-workers with the \nsame amount of service, she was treated better than \nthem because of her total disability.  \nAlthough the City would have liked to continue \npaying disability retirees with less than 25 years the \nsame subsidy as 25-year retirees, it was forced to cut \ncosts and start treating disability retirees the same as, \nrather than better than, everyone else with less than \n25 years of service. Doc. 38-10 at 2; J.A. 34 n. 1, 40. \nPrior to the 2003 ordinance, the City had the resources \nto pay the subsidy to age 65 for both 25-year retirees \nand \u201cdisability retirees\u201d with less than 25 years. \nHowever, the City was permitted to change that policy \nbefore Petitioner\u2019s rights vested at retirement. Florida \nSheriffs Ass'n v. Dep't of Admin., Div. of Ret., 408 So. \n2d 1033, 1036-37 (Fla. 1981). \nPetitioner claims (at 11) that the City\u2019s HR \nDirector could not explain why the City changed the \nsubsidy policy. He was deposed nearly twenty years \nafter the ordinance was passed and thus his \nknowledge of it was limited to what could be discerned \nfrom the public records. Doc. 39-4 at 1, 10, 80. The \ndistrict court found that the purpose was clearly set \nforth in the ordinance itself and the City articulated \nits legitimate reasons for its service-based policy to \nreward long-term employment, contain costs, and \nprovide compassion for employees who retire early due \nto disability. J.A. 34 n. 1, 40, 45. The City\u2019s policy \n\n9 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nprovided disabled employees access to the same \nbenefits available to all. Doc. 38-10 at 4, \u00b6 2.45(C).  \nC. Procedural Background \n1. The City moved to dismiss Petitioner\u2019s ADA \nclaim because she only alleged post-employment \ndiscrimination when she was no longer a \u201cqualified \nindividual.\u201d Doc. 14 at 4-5. Petitioner did not dispute \nthe City\u2019s characterization of her allegations or argue \nthat her complaint actually alleged discrimination \nduring her employment. See Doc. 17. Petitioner also \ndid not move for leave to amend to add allegations of \ndiscrimination during employment. \nTherefore, \nthe \ndistrict \ncourt \ndismissed \nPetitioner\u2019s ADA claim because she alleged the \n\u201cdiscrimination did not occur until Plaintiff was no \nlonger able to perform the essential functions of her \njob\u201d when she was no longer a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d \nPet. App. 26a. After dismissal, Petitioner did not move \nfor reconsideration arguing the court misapprehended \nany allegations of discrimination during employment.  \nOn her Equal Protection Clause Claim, the \ndistrict court found the policy drew \u201cneutral\u201d lines \nbased on service requiring all retirees to serve 25 \nyears to earn the subsidy to age 65. J.A. 44-45. \n2. Petitioner\u2019s initial brief in the Eleventh Circuit \nconfirmed that her complaint only alleged post-\nemployment discrimination because she argued she \n\u201ccould not have brought these claims while she was \nstill employed\u201d because \u201cshe would have lacked \nstanding.\u201d Pet. C.A. Br. 22. The Eleventh Circuit \ntherefore refused to pass upon this issue expressly \n\n10 \n\u0003\n\u0003\ndisclaimed \nin \nher \ninitial \nbrief \nand \nuntimely \ncontradicted in her reply brief. Pet. App. 17a.  \nNext, the Eleventh Circuit analyzed whether the \nCity\u2019s post-employment application of the subsidy \npolicy was, in its own right, a fresh violation of Title I, \nrather \nthan \nan \nalleged \nextension \nof \npast \ndiscrimination. Pet. App. 16a. In doing so, it found \nthat nothing in the Ledbetter Act \u201cchanges Title I\u2019s \nsubstantive requirements,\u201d including the requirement \nthat one be a \u201cqualified individual\u201d at the time of the \ndiscriminatory act. Pet. App. 15a. It held the \nLedbetter Act\u2019s \u201crelaxed statute of limitations helps a \nplaintiff only if that plaintiff otherwise has a claim for \ndiscrimination.\u201d Id.  \nTher\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

That issue is whether discrimination \noccurring entirely post-employment against totally \ndisabled former employees, is actionable under Title I \nof the ADA. The Eleventh Circuit, joining the majority \nof courts, correctly held that Title I unambiguously \nprohibits discrimination solely against an individual \nwho \u201ccan perform\u201d the job she presently \u201cholds or \ndesires.\u201d Thus, it concluded that because Petitioner \ncould not establish that the City committed any \ndiscriminatory acts against her while she could \nperform the essential functions of a job that she held \nor desired to hold, her Title I claim failed. \nIn Part I of her brief, Petitioner raises an \nargument that she not only failed to press below, but \nthat she expressly disclaimed. She untimely argues \nshe \nwas \ndiscriminated \nagainst \nduring \nher \nemployment when she was a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d \nHowever, she conceded in her initial brief below that \nshe could not have brought these claims while she was \nstill employed and able to do her job because she would \nhave lacked standing. The Eleventh Circuit properly \ndeclined to decide her opposite position untimely \nraised for the first time in her reply brief.  \nThis Court \u201cdoes not \u2018[o]rdinarily...decide in the \nfirst instance issues not decided below.\u2019\u201d City of \nAustin, Texas v. Reagan Nat'l Advert. of Austin, LLC, \n596 U.S. 61, 76 (2022). Therefore, Petitioner\u2019s \ncontention that this Court \u201cneed not reach\u201d the circuit-\nsplit question and should reverse on the issue she \ndisclaimed, should be rejected. This Court should only \n\n2 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nconsider the circuit-split question. But to the extent \nthis Court reviews the question not pressed or passed \nupon, it should find that Petitioner\u2019s unpreserved \nclaims of discrimination during employment are \nunpled and time-barred. The Ledbetter Act has no \nplace here to save her waived claims allegedly \naccruing two decades ago.  \nPetitioner incorrectly claims that the Eleventh \nCircuit held that a disabled retired firefighter may be \nsubjected to discrimination with impunity. It said \nnothing of the sort. And \u201c[i]t seems more than \nuncharitable to say,\u201d Kincaid v. Williams, 143 S. Ct. \n2414, 2418 (2023) (Alito, J., dissenting), that the court \nof appeal\u2019s finding of an unambiguous limitation on \nTitle I\u2019s prohibitions is the same as finding that a \nretiree \u201cmay be subjected to discrimination with \nimpunity.\u201d  \nThe Eleventh Circuit also did not hold that former \nemployees can never sue under Title I regarding post-\nemployment benefits. It held that discrimination \noccurring during employment against a \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d is actionable under the ADA. And for \nalleged discrimination post-employment, there are \nnumerous remedies under other federal and state \nlaws. Thus, Petitioner\u2019s claims failed, not for lack of \nremedy or an incorrect interpretation of the ADA, but \nbecause of her allegations and litigation strategy. This \nCourt should affirm.  \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent statutory provisions are reproduced in \nthe appendix to this brief.  \n\n3 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Statutory Background \n1. In enacting the Americans with Disabilities \nAct, Congress found, in part, that \u201csociety has tended \nto isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(a)(2). Congress enacted Title I of the \nADA to provide legal remedies for discrimination \nagainst disabled workers that did not previously exist. \nSee 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(a)(4). At the time, several other \nfederal statutes existed for the protection of employee \nretirement benefits such as ERISA and the Social \nSecurity Act. The Equal Protection Clause provided an \nadditional remedy for public employees. See Tennessee \nv. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 522 (2004) (\u201cemphasiz[ing] that \nthe House and Senate Committee Reports on the ADA \nfocused on \u2018[d]iscrimination [in]...employment in the \nprivate sector,\u2019 and made no mention of discrimination \nin public employment.\u201d) (emphasis added by the \nCourt). \nThis Court has also \u201cidentified Title I\u2019s purpose as \nenforcement of the Fourteenth Amendment's [equal \nprotection] command that \u2018all persons similarly \nsituated should be treated alike.\u2019\u201d Id. Thus, except as \nto the ADA\u2019s requirement that employers provide \n\u201creasonable accommodations\u201d for the disabled, 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A), the essence of the ADA is \nequal\u2014not preferential\u2014treatment for the disabled. \nSee Williams v. United Ins. Co. of Am., 253 F.3d 280, \n282 (7th Cir. 2001) (an \u201cemployer is not required to \ngive the disabled employee preferential treatment.\u201d). \n\u201cThe ADA requires only that persons with disabilities \nhave the opportunity to receive the same benefits as \nnon-disabled officers who have given an equivalent \n\n4 \n\u0003\n\u0003\namount of service.\u201d Castellano v. City of New York, 142 \nF.3d 58, 70 (2d Cir. 1998). \n2. The ADA\u2019s prohibition against discrimination \nin employment is codified in Title I: \n(a) General rule. No covered entity shall \ndiscriminate \nagainst \na \nqualified \nindividual on the basis of disability in \nregard to job application procedures, \nthe hiring, advancement, or discharge \nof employees, employee compensation, \njob \ntraining, \nand \nother \nterms, \nconditions, \nand \nprivileges \nof \nemployment. \n \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a) (emphasis added). The term of art \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d is incorporated into the general \nrule and defines the class of individuals protected by \nits prohibition against discrimination: \n \nThe term \u201cqualified individual\u201d means an \nindividual \nwho, \nwith \nor \nwithout \nreasonable accommodation, can perform \nthe essential functions of the employment \nposition that such individual holds or \ndesires. \n \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8). \u201cThe determination of whether a \nperson is qualified should be made at the time of the \nemployment action, e.g. hiring or promotion...\u201d H.R. \nRep. No. 101\u2013485(III), at 34 (1990).  \n \n3. While Title I \u201cborrows much of its procedural \nframework from [T]itle VII,\u201d it \u201cborrows much of its \n\n5 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nsubstantive framework from Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973.\u201d Id. at 31. The \u201cconcept\u201d of \na \u201cqualified individual\u201d comes from \u201cthe regulations \nimplementing...the Rehabilitation Act\u201d\u2014not from \nTitle VII. Id. at 33; see also Alexander v. Choate, 469 \nU.S. 287, 309 (1985) (no unlawful discrimination \nfound under the Rehabilitation Act because the state's \npolicy was \u201cneutral on its face\u201d and it \u201cmade the same \nbenefit...equally accessible to both handicapped and \nnonhandicapped persons\u2026\u201d). \nB. Factual Background \n1. Because Petitioner argues that the Eleventh \nCircuit erred in affirming the dismissal of her ADA \nclaim at the pleading stage, the facts should be taken \nfrom her complaint only. Petitioner\u2019s statement of the \nfacts, however, largely draws from the evidence \ndeveloped at the summary judgment stage on her \nEqual Protection Clause claim. The pertinent factual \nallegations from her complaint are as follows.  \nPetitioner alleged that when she was hired in \n1999, the City \u201cpaid for health insurance for its \nemployees who retired after 25 years of service and its \nemployees who retired on account of disability\u201d until \n\u201cthe age of 65.\u201d Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 13, 19. In 2018, she accepted \na disability retirement because she was completely \nunable to perform her duties as a firefighter due to an \nunidentified \u201cphysical disability.\u201d Id. \u00b6 16. \nFifteen years before she retired, the City changed \nits policy in 2003 to require all retirees to complete 25 \nyears\u2019 service to earn the subsidy to age 65. See id. \u00b6\u00b6 \n19, 24. But the change still treated disability retirees \nbetter than similarly situated non-disabled retirees \n\n6 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nwith less than 25 years because while the latter \nreceived nothing, the former received the subsidy for \n24 months or until their receipt of Medicare benefits, \nwhichever came first. Id. \u00b6 24.  \nPetitioner, however, did not sue the City for \nbreach of an employment contract or bring an \nunconstitutional takings claim based on the change. \nThus, Petitioner\u2019s statement that the City \u201cpromised\u201d \nher the benefits under the defunct policy from 15 years \nbefore \nshe \nretired, \nis \nfactually \nand \nlegally \nunsupported. Pet. Br. 11. Petitioner only had a vested \nright to benefits under a policy \u201cin effect at the time\u201d \nof her retirement. City of Hollywood v. Bien, 209 So. \n3d 1, 3 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2016). \nWhile Petitioner claims the policy change was \nmade \u201cquietly,\u201d Pet. Br. 10, her complaint actually \nalleges a public announcement of the policy because it \nwas \u201ccodified in City Policy Section 2.45(c)\u201d of its \nordinances, and in its \u201cofficial personnel policies.\u201d Doc. \n1, \u00b6 24; see also Doc. 38-10 at 2-5; Doc. 38-11 at 4. Her \ncomplaint does not allege that she was unaware of the \npersonnel policy or the ordinance at the time of its \npassage or when she retired.  \nBecause she was totally disabled and unable to \nwork, Petitioner retired early with only 20 years\u2019 \nservice instead of the 25 required to earn the subsidy \nto age 65. Doc. 1, \u00b6 16. Her complaint did not allege \nwhen she became disabled or that she continued to \nwork thereafter as a \u201cqualified individual\u201d with a \ndisability before she retired. Petitioner only alleged \nthat because of a \u201cphysical disability\u201d she took a \ndisability retirement in November 2018 and as a \nresult, the City\u2019s subsidy policy would be applied to \n\n7 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nher, and she would lose the subsidy in November of \n2020\u201424 months after her retirement date. Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 \n16, 26.  \n2. Petitioner erroneously claims that the City\u2019s \nsubsidy \npolicy \ndistinguished \nbetween \n\u201cnormal \nretirees\u201d and disabled retirees. Pet. Br. 11.1 However, \nthe phrase \u201cnormal retiree\u201d appears nowhere in the \nordinance. See Doc. 38-10 at 2-5. Rather, the ordinance \nshows that any retiree, disabled or non-disabled, with \n25 years of service is eligible for the subsidy to age 65. \nDoc. 38-10 at 4, \u00b6 2.45(C), (G). The ordinance did not \ncondition the subsidy to age 65 on a \u201cnormal \nretirement\u201d because under the City\u2019s pension plan, a \n\u201cnormal retirement\u201d could be taken after only ten (10) \nyears of service. Doc. 39-17 at 27; J.A. 35, n. 2.  \nPetitioner, like everyone else, was eligible to \nreceive the full subsidy so long as she served 25 years. \nHowever, in 2018, she requested and was awarded a \n\u201cdisability retirement\u201d with only 20 years of service. \nDoc. 38-5.2 But even though she failed to fulfill the \nservice-based criteria, the City, out of compassion, \nprovided 24 months of the subsidy to its totally \ndisabled retirees who retired early short of 25 years. \nDoc. 38-10 at 4, \u00b6 2.45(C), (F), (G); J.A. 34-35, 40; Doc. \n38 at 21-22. Uncoincidentally, 24 months is exactly \nhow long it takes before a totally disabled retiree like \nPetitioner is eligible to receive Medicare benefits. See \nMedicare Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 426(b)(2)(A), 1395o(a)(1). \n\u0003\n1 Petitioner cites to Doc. 39-16 for this proposition but omits key \nlanguage from that document which shows that the policy was \nbased solely on years of service and not a \u201cnormal\u201d retirement.  \n2 Petitioner insinuates that she was disabled \u201cin the line of duty.\u201d \nPet. Br. 1, 11. The record shows she was not. Doc. 38-5. \n\n8 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nSimilarly situated, non-disabled retirees with only 20 \nyears\u2019 service received no subsidy at all and they are \nnot Medicare eligible because they are not disabled. \nDoc. 38-10 at 4, \u00b6 2.45(C); J.A. 34-35, 44. Thus, far \nfrom treating Petitioner worse because of her \ndisability than her non-disabled co-workers with the \nsame amount of service, she was treated better than \nthem because of her total disability.  \nAlthough the City would have liked to continue \npaying disability retirees with less than 25 years the \nsame subsidy as 25-year retirees, it was forced to cut \ncosts and start treating disability retirees the same as, \nrather than better than, everyone else with less than \n25 years of service. Doc. 38-10 at 2; J.A. 34 n. 1, 40. \nPrior to the 2003 ordinance, the City had the resources \nto pay the subsidy to age 65 for both 25-year retirees \nand \u201cdisability retirees\u201d with less than 25 years. \nHowever, the City was permitted to change that policy \nbefore Petitioner\u2019s rights vested at retirement. Florida \nSheriffs Ass'n v. Dep't of Admin., Div. of Ret., 408 So. \n2d 1033, 1036-37 (Fla. 1981). \nPetitioner claims (at 11) that the City\u2019s HR \nDirector could not explain why the City changed the \nsubsidy policy. He was deposed nearly twenty years \nafter the ordinance was passed and thus his \nknowledge of it was limited to what could be discerned \nfrom the public records. Doc. 39-4 at 1, 10, 80. The \ndistrict court found that the purpose was clearly set \nforth in the ordinance itself and the City articulated \nits legitimate reasons for its service-based policy to \nreward long-term employment, contain costs, and \nprovide compassion for employees who retire early due \nto disability. J.A. 34 n. 1, 40, 45. The City\u2019s policy \n\n9 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nprovided disabled employees access to the same \nbenefits available to all. Doc. 38-10 at 4, \u00b6 2.45(C).  \nC. Procedural Background \n1. The City moved to dismiss Petitioner\u2019s ADA \nclaim because she only alleged post-employment \ndiscrimination when she was no longer a \u201cqualified \nindividual.\u201d Doc. 14 at 4-5. Petitioner did not dispute \nthe City\u2019s characterization of her allegations or argue \nthat her complaint actually alleged discrimination \nduring her employment. See Doc. 17. Petitioner also \ndid not move for leave to amend to add allegations of \ndiscrimination during employment. \nTherefore, \nthe \ndistrict \ncourt \ndismissed \nPetitioner\u2019s ADA claim because she alleged the \n\u201cdiscrimination did not occur until Plaintiff was no \nlonger able to perform the essential functions of her \njob\u201d when she was no longer a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d \nPet. App. 26a. After dismissal, Petitioner did not move \nfor reconsideration arguing the court misapprehended \nany allegations of discrimination during employment.  \nOn her Equal Protection Clause Claim, the \ndistrict court found the policy drew \u201cneutral\u201d lines \nbased on service requiring all retirees to serve 25 \nyears to earn the subsidy to age 65. J.A. 44-45. \n2. Petitioner\u2019s initial brief in the Eleventh Circuit \nconfirmed that her complaint only alleged post-\nemployment discrimination because she argued she \n\u201ccould not have brought these claims while she was \nstill employed\u201d because \u201cshe would have lacked \nstanding.\u201d Pet. C.A. Br. 22. The Eleventh Circuit \ntherefore refused to pass upon this issue expressly \n\n10 \n\u0003\n\u0003\ndisclaimed \nin \nher \ninitial \nbrief \nand \nuntimely \ncontradicted in her reply brief. Pet. App. 17a.  \nNext, the Eleventh Circuit analyzed whether the \nCity\u2019s post-employment application of the subsidy \npolicy was, in its own right, a fresh violation of Title I, \nrather \nthan \nan \nalleged \nextension \nof \npast \ndiscrimination. Pet. App. 16a. In doing so, it found \nthat nothing in the Ledbetter Act \u201cchanges Title I\u2019s \nsubstantive requirements,\u201d including the requirement \nthat one be a \u201cqualified individual\u201d at the time of the \ndiscriminatory act. Pet. App. 15a. It held the \nLedbetter Act\u2019s \u201crelaxed statute of limitations helps a \nplaintiff only if that plaintiff otherwise has a claim for \ndiscrimination.\u201d Id.  \nTherefore, it adhered to its precedent holding that \nTitle I is unambiguous and contains a \u201cclear temporal \nqualifier\u201d stating \u201c[o]nly someone \u2018who, with or \nwithout reasonable accommodation, can perform the \nessential functions of the employment position that \nsuch individual holds or desires\u201d is protected from \ndisability discrimination. Pet. App. 11a (emphasis in \noriginal). It concluded that \u201c[b]ecause Stanley cannot \nestablish that the City committed any discriminatory \nacts against her while she could perform the essential \nfunctions of a job that she held or desired to hold, her \nTitle I claim fails.\u201d Pet. App. 18a. \n\u0003\n \n\n11 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI. Part I of Petitioner\u2019s brief is unrelated to the \ncircuit-split question upon which this Court granted \ncertiorari regarding whether discrimination occurring \nentirely post-employment is actionable under the \nADA. Instead, Part I seeks review of a different \nquestion regarding whether Petitioner sufficiently \nalleged discrimination during her employment as a \n\u201cqualified individual.\u201d Petitioner argues her ADA \nclaim allegedly accrued in 2003 when the City passed \nits subsidy policy. She admits she was not disabled at \nthat time but argues Title I did not require her to have \na disability to sue for disability discrimination. She \nheavily relies on the minimal standing requirements \nin the enforcement provisions of Title I and Title VII. \nBut Title I\u2019s enforcement provision only applies to \n\u201cany person alleging discrimination on the basis of \ndisability in violation of any provision of this chapter.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12117(a) (emphasis added). This is a \n\u201ccross-reference\u2026directing us to a class of claims with \na settled and statutorily precise meaning.\u201d Almond v. \nUnified Sch. Dist. No. 501, 665 F.3d 1174, 1181 (10th \nCir. 2011).  \nThe ADA\u2019s \u201cclass of claims\u201d are found in its \nsubstantive anti-discrimination provision, \u00a7 12112(a), \nwhich has a settled meaning requiring Petitioner to \nshow: \u201c(1) that she was disabled under the ADA; (2) \nthat she was a qualified individual with a disability; \nand (3) that she was discriminated against by her \nemployer because of that disability.\u201d Dunlap v. Liberty \nNat. Prod., Inc., 878 F.3d 794, 798\u201399 (9th Cir. 2017). \nBecause Petitioner conceded that she did not have a \ndisability in 2003 and further conceded that she \n\n12 \n\u0003\n\u0003\n\u201clacked standing\u201d to sue for anything occurring \u201cwhile \nshe was still employed,\u201d Pet. C.A. Br. 22, the Eleventh \nCircuit correctly declined to pass upon whether her \nallegations sufficiently alleged she was discriminated \nagainst as a \u201cqualified individual\u201d at any time before \nshe retired.  Pet. App. 17a. \nThe Eleventh Circuit also correctly held that the \nLedbetter Act did not change Title I\u2019s substantive \nrequirement that she be a \u201cqualified individual\u201d with \na disability at the time of the alleged discrimination. \nId. 15a. Because she only alleged discrimination \noccurring entirely post-employment when she could no \nlonger perform the essential functions of her job, she \nwas not a \u201cqualified individual\u201d entitled to sue.  \nII. The Eleventh Circuit correctly held that Title \nI\u2019s use of the present tense unambiguously prohibits \ndiscrimination solely against an individual who \u201ccan \nperform\u201d the job she presently \u201cholds or desires.\u201d Id. \n11a-12a. This reading is consistent with the ADA\u2019s \nstatutory scheme which uses the term \u201cindividuals\u201d to \nbroadly include former employees, but \u201cqualified \nindividuals\u201d to refer only to current employees. And it \ngives effect to every word in the definition and the \ngeneral rule where it appears.  \nPetitioner\u2019s interpretation requires this Court to \nrewrite Title I to include an exception to the \u201ccan \nperform\u201d clause for retirees. It is based on a policy \npreference to avoid what she perceives as an \u201cabsurd\u201d \nconsequence of the express line drawn by Congress. \nHowever, \u201cCongress could reasonably decide to enable \ndisabled people who can work with reasonable \naccommodation to get and keep jobs, without also \ndeciding to equalize post-employment fringe benefits \n\n13 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nfor people who cannot work.\u201d Weyer v. Twentieth \nCentury Fox Film Corp., 198 F.3d 1104, 1112 (9th Cir. \n2000). The Eleventh Circuit correctly refused to allow \npolicy preference or purpose\u2014even purpose as most \nnarrowly defined\u2014to negate the plain language of the \nstatute.  \nARGUMENT \nThe question presented, as inaccurately framed \nby Petitioner, asks under the ADA, \u201cdoes a former \nemployee\u2014who was qualified to perform her job and \nwho \nearned \npost-employment \nbenefits \nwhile \nemployed\u2014lose her right to sue over discrimination \nwith respect to those benefits solely because she no \nlonger holds her job?\u201d Pet. Br. i. A former employee \nwho has a \u201cright to sue\u201d cannot \u201close\u201d that right \n\u201csolely\u201d because she no longer holds her job. If so, there \ncould be no ADA claim for a discriminatory \ntermination\u2014a claim the Eleventh Circuit has \npermitted former employees to bring. See Taylor v. \nFood World, Inc., 133 F.3d 1419 (11th Cir. 1998).  \nThe Eleventh Circuit held that to \u201cfall within Title \nI\u2019s anti-discrimination provision, a plaintiff\u2019s claim \nmust depend on an act committed by the defendant \nwhile the plaintiff was either working for the \ndefendant or seeking to work for the defendant.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 8a-9a. This holding clearly makes room for \nformer employees to sue if they were discriminated \nagainst during their employment. Because the \nEleventh Circuit did not hold that former employees \nare categorically barred from suing under the ADA, \nPetitioner is not entitled to a reversal based on a \nruling that was never made.  \n\n14 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nThe \ncircuit-split \nquestion \nis \nwhether \ndiscrimination occurring entirely post-employment \nagainst \ntotally \ndisabled \nformer \nemployees, \nis \nactionable under Title I. The Eleventh Circuit, siding \nwith the majority, held that \u201c[b]ecause Stanley cannot \nestablish that the City committed any discriminatory \nacts against her while she could perform the essential \nfunctions of a job that she held or desired to hold, her \nTitle I claim fails.\u201d Pet. App. 18a.  \nTherefore, Part I of Petitioner\u2019s brief framing the \nissue as whether \u201c[t]he ADA permits former \nemployees to bring suit with respect to post-\nemployment benefits,\u201d attacks a strawman. Pet. Br. \n17. As the Eleventh Circuit never categorically barred \nsuch suits, Petitioner reveals the real alleged errors \nfor this Court\u2019s review deep into Part I(C)(2). Id. 24-\n27. In doing so, she has \u201csmuggl[ed] additional \nquestions into\u201d the case \u201cafter [this Court] grant[ed] \ncertiorari.\u201d Irvine v. People of California, 347 U.S. 128, \n129 (1954).  \nCompletely unrelated to the circuit-split question \nregarding whether post-employment discrimination \nagainst former employees is actionable under Title I, \nPetitioner argues the Eleventh Circuit erred by: (1) \nfinding that she disclaimed standing to sue for \ndiscrimination occurring during her employment, Pet. \nBr. 24, 27; (2) misapplying Title I\u2019s \u201cdisability\u201d \nelement to the facts of this case, Id. 25; and (3) not \napplying the Ledbetter Act to find her time-barred \nclaims allegedly accruing during employment \u201cre-\naccrued in 2020,\u201d Id. 24.  \nNone \nof \nthese \nquestions \nare \n\u201csubsidiary \nquestion[s] fairly included\u201d in the circuit-split \n\n15 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nquestion. Yee v. City of Escondido, Cal., 503 U.S. 519, \n535 (1992). Instead, Petitioner has relegated the \ncircuit-split question to her secondary argument for \nreversal. Pet. Br., Part II, 27. Remarkably, she argues \nthat this Court \u201cneed not even reach\u201d the circuit-split \nquestion and should reverse based solely on the above \nthree alleged misapplications of law to fact. Pet. Br. \n17. This is backwards. This Court should ignore Part \nI and proceed solely to resolving the circuit-split \nquestion in Part II. But to the extent this Court \nreviews Part I, it should find that she waived these \narguments, and any claim of discrimination during \nemployment is unpled and time-barred. \nI. \nThe Non-Circuit-Split Questions Regarding \nDiscrimination During Employment \nIn support of her argument of discrimination \nduring employment when she was a \u201cqualified \nindividual,\u201d Petitioner provides a truncated version of \nTitle I\u2019s enforcement and substantive provisions \nomitting crucial elements under \u00a7 12112(a). Pet. Br. \n17-23. She argues merely pleading that she was \n\u201caggrieved\u201d regarding her post-employment benefits, \nwith the aid of the Ledbetter Act, brings her \u201cclaim \nacross the finish line.\u201d Pet. Br. 21.  \nHer claim, however, never got off the starting \nblocks because she expressly disclaimed standing to \nsue for anything occurring during her employment. \nPet. C.A. Br. 22. To be sure, her initial brief in the \nEleventh Circuit argued: \nMs. Stanley could not have brought these \nclaims while she was still employed and able \nto do her job because she had not yet learned \n\n16 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nof the discrimination and become a disability \nretiree impacted by the discrimination so she \nwould have lacked standing. \nId. (emphasis added). Even in the absence of this \ndisclaimer, her complaint failed to demonstrate that a \nTitle I claim accrued during her employment or that \nany such claim was timely. Determining the \ntimeliness of Petitioner\u2019s 2019 EEOC charge required \nher \u201cto identify precisely the \u2018unlawful employment \npractice\u2019 of which\u201d she complains. Delaware State Coll. \nv. Ricks, 449 U.S. 250, 257 (1980).  \nPetitioner argues her claims accrued during her \nemployment: (1) in 2003 when the City adopted its \nsubsidy policy; (2) when she became disabled during \nemployment; and (3) at some unspecified time when it \nbecame \u201cinevitable\u201d that she would need to take a \ndisability retirement prior to her retirement on \nNovember 1, 2018. Pet. Br. 24-26. These arguments \ncannot be squared with the allegations of the \ncomplaint. And Petitioner has waived them.  \nA. Petitioner disclaimed and her complaint \nfailed to demonstrate any claim accrued \nin 2003 when the City adopted its \nsubsidy policy.  \n1. \nThe \nEleventh \nCircuit \nfound \nPetitioner \n\u201cconcedes, and we agree, that her claim cannot turn on \nthe 2003 amendment to the benefits plan because she \nwas not yet disabled at that time.\u201d Pet. App. 16a. \nPetitioner admitted in her initial brief that the City \nadopted its subsidy policy \u201cin 2003, when Ms. Stanley \nwas a non-disabled employee.\u201d Pet. C.A. Br. 22 n. 5. \nShe then conceded she \u201clacked standing\u201d to bring \n\n17 \n\u0003\n\u0003\n\u201cthese claims while she was still employed and able to \ndo her job\u201d because she was not yet a \u201cdisability retiree \nimpacted by the discrimination.\u201d Pet. C.A. Br. 22 \n(emphasis added). Although Petitioner purported to \nincorporate the United States\u2019 contrary arguments \ninto her initial brief, Pet. C.A. Br. 20, the Eleventh \nCircuit was not required to scour the amicus brief for \nbetter arguments to save Petitioner\u2019s case. The \nEleventh Circuit properly relied on her arguments in \nher brief expressly disclaiming standing to sue for \nanything during her employment.  \nPetitioner and the United States attempt to \nexplain away her concessions by arguing she only \nmeant to disclaim any financial impact during her \nemployment. Pet. Br. 27; U.S. Am. Br. 27-28. This \nargument cannot be squared with her clear concession \nthat she \u201clacked standing\u201d to sue \u201cwhile she was still \nemployed.\u201d Pet. C.A. Br. 22. Indeed, financial impact \nis not necessary for standing, but an injury is. Her way \nof describing \u201cinjury\u201d was by using the word \u201cimpact\u201d \nbecause otherwise she would not have disclaimed \nstanding simply because she suffered no financial \nimpact during employment.  \nIt is true that this Court\u2019s \u201cpractice \u2018permit[s] \nreview of an issue not pressed [below] so long as it has \nbeen passed upon.\u2019\u201d Citizens United v. Fed. Election \nComm'n, 558 U.S. 310, 330 (2010). To the extent that \nthe Eleventh Circuit passed upon this issue by \n\u201cagree[ing]\u201d with Petitioner's concession that \u201cher \nclaim cannot turn on the 2003\u201d adoption of the policy, \nPet. App. 16a, prudential concerns weigh in favor of \nthis Court declining to review this matter. A mere \nfailure to \u201cpress\u201d an argument is markedly different \n\n18 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nthan an express disclaimer of an argument because \nthe latter invites the complained-of error. See City of \nSpringfield, Mass. v. Kibbe, 480 U.S. 257, 259 \n(1987) (rejecting argument \u201cthat we need not concern \nourselves about Springfield's failure to preserve this \nissue, because it was passed on by the Court of \nAppeals\u201d because \u201cthere would be considerable \nprudential objection to reversing a judgment because \nof instructions that petitioner accepted, and indeed \nitself requested.\u201d).  \nFurther, while an appellant can raise on appeal \nany new \u201cargument\u201d in support of a \u201cclaim,\u201d U.S. \nAmicus Br. 28 n. 6, it cannot wait until its reply brief \nto flip-flop on a position in true ambush fashion as \nPetitioner did here. Compare Pet. C.A. Br. 22 with Pet. \nC.A. Reply Br. 5. This Court should hold that because \nPetitioner \u201craised this issue for the first time in [her] \nreply \nbrief,\u201d \nshe \n\u201chas \nwaived \nthis \nclaim.\u201d \nUnited States v. Dicter, 198 F.3d 1284, 1289 (11th Cir. \n1999). \n2. Even if Petitioner hadn\u2019t expressly disclaimed \nthe argument below, her allegations were still \ninsufficient to demonstrate that a claim accrued in \n2003. Although she concedes she was not disabled \nthen, she incorrectly argues she was not required to \nhave a disability at that time to bring suit. Pet. Br. 25.  \nTitle I\u2019s enforcement provision, \u00a7 12117(a), \nincorporates Title VII\u2019s remedial framework which \nstates any \u201cperson claiming to be aggrieved\u201d can bring \n\u201ca civil action.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1). This Court \nhas held that \u201caggrieved\u201d in Title VII \u201cenabl[es] suit \nby any plaintiff with an interest arguably [sought] to \nbe protected by the statute...while excluding plaintiffs \n\n19 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nwho might technically be injured in an Article III \nsense but whose interests are unrelated to the \nstatutory prohibitions in Title VII.\u201d Thompson v. N. \nAm. Stainless, LP, 562 U.S. 170, 178 (2011) (internal \nquotation \nmarks \nand \ncitation \nomitted). \nPut \ndifferently, the requirement that the plaintiff be \n\u201caggrieved\u201d is a requirement that the plaintiff have \n\u201cstatutory\u201d standing to sue. Id. at 177-78. \nBut, here, Petitioner failed to allege Article III or \nstatutory standing to sue in 2003. Her claim is based \non \u201cher disability.\u201d Doc. 1, \u00b6 26. And yet, she was not \ndisabled in 2003 and therefore not injured by a policy \nthat allegedly discriminated only against the disabled. \nSee Bostock v. Clayton Cnty., Georgia, 590 U.S. 644, \n681 \n(2020) \n(\u201cDiscriminate \nagainst\u201d \nmeans \n\u201cdistinctions or differences in treatment that injure \nprotected individuals.\u201d).  \nHer claim was not based on the disability of \nsomeone else with whom she associated under \u00a7 \n12112(b)(4), nor was it based on a claim that she was \nmerely \u201cregarded as\u201d disabled under \u00a7 12102(1)(C). \nSee Murray v. Warren Pumps, LLC, 821 F.3d 77, 83 \n(1st Cir. 2016) (a plaintiff must prove her \u201cparticular \ntheory of disability discrimination alleged.\u201d). Based on \nPetitioner\u2019s particular theory in her complaint, she \nwas required to show that she was discriminated \nagainst because of her disability \u201cwhich requires that \nthe disability exist at the time of the discrimination.\u201d \nWeyer, 198 F.3d at 1112.  \nPetitioner argues that the ADAAA of 2008 \nrepealed any requirement that she have a disability to \nsue for a claim allegedly accruing in 2003. Pet. Br. 25. \nThe ADAAA amended \u00a7 12112(a) to prohibit \n\n20 \n\u0003\n\u0003\ndiscrimination \u201cagainst a qualified individual on the \nbasis of disability\u201d rather than \u201cagainst a qualified \nindividual with a disability because of the disability.\u201d \nPub. L. No. 110-325, \u00a7 5(a)(1), 122 Stat. 3557 (2008) \n(emphasis added). However, the Eleventh Circuit and \nits \u201csister circuits...hold that the switch from \u2018because \nof\u2019 to \u2018on the basis of\u2019 in the 2008 amendment to the \nADA did not change or affect its but-for causation \nstandard.\u201d Akridge v. Alfa Ins. Companies, 93 F.4th \n1181, 1192 (11th Cir. 2024). \nThis \namendment \nremoved \nthe \nredundant \nlanguage, \u201cwith a disability because of the disability\u201d \nfrom \u00a7 12112(a) because those words were already \nrepeated several times in the \u201cconstruction\u201d provision, \n\u00a7 12112(b). Section 12112(b)(1), for example, still \nprohibits \n\u201cclassifying \na \njob \napplicant \nor \nemployee...because of the disability of such applicant \nor employee.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(1) (emphasis \nadded). \nThe express purpose of the ADAAA was to \u201creject\u201d \ndecisions of this Court, which Congress found \ninterpreted the definition of a \u201cdisability\u201d too \nnarrowly. Pub. L. No. 110-325, \u00a7 2(b). Congress stated \nthe amendment\u2019s purpose was to clarify \u201cthat the \nquestion of whether an individual's impairment is a \ndisability under the ADA should not demand \nextensive analysis.\u201d Id. at \u00a7 2(b)(5). Therefore, the \nchanges removed the prior emphasis on whether an \nindividual\u2019s impairment met the definition of a \n\u201cdisability.\u201d Congress did not remove the requirement \nthat an individual have a disability all together. \n3. Even if the ADAAA did dispense with the \n\u201cdisability\u201d element, the United States acknowledges \n\n21 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nthat the \u201cADAAA\u2019s amendments...apply to claims that \narose after\u201d January 1, 2009. U.S. Amicus Br. 24 n. 4. \nTherefore, any claim allegedly accruing in 2003 would \nbe governed by the ADA, before the ADAAA allegedly \ndisposed of the disability element.  \n4. Petitioner makes a last-ditch effort to root her \nclaim in 2003 when she was a \u201cqualified individual\u201d by \narguing this Court may \u201cconceive of this claim as \nencompassing two moments of time that complete the \nwhole: when the facially discriminatory policy was \nadopted in 2003, and when Lt. Stanley became \ndisabled.\u201d Pet. Br. 26. However, this Court has \nrecognized that Title VII claims can encompass \ndifferent events at different points in time only in two \nnarrow circumstances: hostile work environment \nclaims and constructive discharge claims. Green v. \nBrennan, 578 U.S. 547, 556-57 (2016). Moreover, \nPetitioner has expressly waived any argument of \ndiscrimination at any time during her employment. \nPet. C.A. Br. 22.  \nB. Petitioner disclaimed and her complaint \nfailed to demonstrate a claim accrued at \nany time between her diagnosis and \nretirement.  \n1. The Eleventh Circuit expressly declined to pass \nupon Petitioner\u2019s untimely argument raised in her \nreply brief that a claim accrued \u201cat some unknown \npoint before she retired but after she was diagnosed \nwith Parkinson\u2019s.\u201d Pet. App. 17a. This Court should \ndecline to \u201cdecide in the first instance issues not \ndecided below.\u201d Reagan Nat'l Advert. of Austin, LLC, \n596 U.S. at 76.  \n\n22 \n\u0003\n\u0003\n2. But if this Court proceeds, it must determine \nwhether the complaint alleged that Petitioner was a \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d with a disability during her \nemployment. She must allege that she became \ndisabled \u201cduring the course of [her] employment but \nnevertheless continued to perform the essential \nrequirements of [her] job with or without a reasonable \naccommodation, until [she] became completely and \ntotally disabled.\u201d Bass v. City of Orlando, 57 F. Supp. \n2d 1318, 1323 (M.D. Fla. 1999), aff'd, 203 F.3d 841 \n(11th Cir. 1999). Contrary to the United States\u2019 \nclaims, Petitioner\u2019s complaint does not allege when or \nhow she became disabled, let alone that she continued \nto work thereafter. U.S. Amicus Br. 26. Petitioner only \nalleged that because of a \u201cphysical disability\u201d she took \na disability retirement in 2018 and as a result would \nlose the subsidy in 2020. Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 16, 26.  \nAlthough we now have the benefit of the summary \njudgment record on her Equal Protection claim, in \ntesting the sufficiency of a complaint, a district court \ndoes not \u201cassume that the [plaintiff] can prove facts \nthat it has not alleged or that the defendants have \nviolated...laws in ways that have not been alleged.\u201d \nAssociated Gen. Contractors of California, Inc. v. \nCalifornia State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, \n526 (1983); see also Aldana v. Del Monte Fresh \nProduce, N.A., Inc., 416 F.3d 1242, 1248 (11th Cir. \n2005) (a plaintiff must \u201callege sufficient facts to \nwarrant [a particular] inference\u201d). \nPetitioner led the district court to its conclusion \nwhen she failed to dispute the City\u2019s argument for \ndismissal that she only alleged post-employment \ndiscrimination when she was no longer a \u201cqualified \n\n23 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nindividual.\u201d Doc. 14 at 4-5; Doc. 17. Instead, she \nmerely argued that the district court should refuse to \nfollow Eleventh Circuit precedent in Gonzales (a case \ninvolving only post-employment discrimination). Doc. \n17 at 5-6. As the Eleventh Circuit noted, she did not \nattempt to distinguish the facts of Gonzales from her \ncase by arguing that she alleged discrimination during \nemployment. Pet. App. 18a. The district court, thus, \nproperly dismissed her ADA claim because her \ncomplaint \u201calleged [the] discrimination did not occur \nuntil Plaintiff was no longer able to perform the \nessential functions of her job.\u201d Doc. 27 at 7. \nFurther, the district court was \u201cnot required to \ngrant\u2026plaintiff leave to amend [her] complaint sua \nsponte when the plaintiff, who is represented by \ncounsel, never filed a motion to amend nor requested \nleave to amend before the district court.\u201d Wagner v. \nDaewoo Heavy Indus. Am. Corp., 314 F.3d 541, 542 \n(11th Cir. 2002). After dismissal, Petitioner did not \nmove \nfor \nreconsideration \narguing \nthe \ncourt \nmisapprehended her complaint allegedly pleading \ndiscrimination during employment. Perhaps fearing \nher claims would be time-barred, she never argued \nthey arose during her employment, years before she \nfiled her 2019 EEOC charge. Indeed, she never \nmentioned the generous accrual provisions of the \nLedbetter Act in the district court. Doc. 1, \u00b6 6.  \nPetitioner\u2019s initial brief in the Eleventh Circuit \nconfirmed that her complaint only alleged post-\nemployment discrimination because she argued she \n\u201ccould not have brought these claims while she was \nstill employed\u201d because \u201cshe would have lacked \nstanding.\u201d Pet. C.A. Br. 22. The Eleventh Circuit \n\n24 \n\u0003\n\u0003\ntherefore properly refused to pass upon this issue \nexpressly disclaimed in her initial brief and untimely \ncontradicted in her reply brief. Pet. App. 17a. This \nCourt should decline to decide this unpreserved issue \nin the first instance, and as demonstrated above, it is \nunsupported by her allegations.  \nC. The Ledbetter Act\u2019s generous accrual \nprovisions do not create a claim where \nnone exists. \nIt is clear that if a claim accrued in 2003, it \nexpired long before Petitioner filed her EEOC charge \nin 2019. Doc. 1, \u00b6 6. Petitioner argues that under the \nLedbetter Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e5(e)(3)(A), her 2003 \nclaim \u201cre-accrued in 2020\u201d when she \u201cwas \u2018affected\u2019 \nwhen her subsidy ended.\u201d Pet. Br. 24, 26 n. 1. The \nLedbetter Act has no place here.  \n\u201cOrdinarily, a limitations period commences \nwhen the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of \naction.\u201d Green v. Brennan, 578 U.S. 547, 554 (2016) \n(cleaned up). \u201c[A] cause of action does not become \n\u2018complete and present\u2019 for limitations purposes until \nthe plaintiff can file suit and obtain relief.\u201d Id. (cleaned \nup). Petitioner failed to demonstrate she had a \n\u201ccomplete and present\u201d claim during her employment.  \nIndeed, \nany \nclaim \nof \ndisability-based \ndiscrimination in 2003 when she was not disabled \nwould have been dismissed for lack of standing, as she \nconceded below but refuses to admit now. Pet. Br. C.A. \n22. If no claim accrued in 2003, it could not \u201cre-accrue\u201d \npost-employment. \u201cA plaintiff must plead and prove \nthe elements of a pay-discrimination claim to benefit \nfrom the Ledbetter Act's accrual provisions.\u201d Davis v. \n\n25 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nBombardier Transp. Holdings (USA) Inc., 794 F.3d \n266, 269 (2d Cir. 2015); see also AT & T Corp. v. \nHulteen, 556 U.S. 701, 716 (2009) (Ledbetter Act did \nnot save the plaintiff\u2019s untimely claim because the \noriginal \nemployment \npractice \n\u201cwas \nnot \ndiscriminatory\u201d). The Ledbetter Act \u201cis an accrual \nrule; it does not affect the substance of the claim.\u201d \nMcReynolds v. Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc., 694 F.3d 873, \n888 (7th Cir. 2012). Therefore, the Eleventh Circuit \ncorrectly held the Ledbetter Act\u2019s \u201crelaxed statute of \nlimitations helps a plaintiff only if that plaintiff \notherwise has a claim for discrimination.\u201d Pet. App. \n15a. \nThe Eleventh Circuit did not pass upon whether \nthe Ledbetter Act should apply to allow a Title I claim \nto \u201cre-accrue\u201d when an individual is \u201caffected\u201d post-\nemployment when she is no longer qualified. This \nCourt should decline to decide this issue in the first \ninstance. This is especially so where Petitioner has not \nshown that the facts of Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & \nRubber Co., 550 U.S. 618 (2007), which prompted the \nLedbetter Act, are sufficiently similar to the subject \nfacts to warrant extension of the Act here. Unlike the \nsecret decisions creating an unknown pay disparity for \nMs. Ledbetter, the City\u2019s subsidy policy was a publicly \nannounced act codified in its ordinances and \u201cofficial \npersonnel policies.\u201d Doc. 1, \u00b6 24; see also Doc. 38-10 at \n2-5; Doc. 38-11 at 4. Such fully communicated acts can \nbe vindicated \u201cwithout the need for the Ledbetter Act's \ngenerous accrual provisions because the employee had \nnotice of the pay reduction.\u201d Davis, 794 F.3d at 271.  \nPetitioner\u2019s later testimony claiming ignorance of \nthe ordinance is irrelevant. See Taylor v. Michael, 724 \n\n26 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nF.3d 806, 811 (7th Cir.2013) (\u201cLack of familiarity with \nthe law...is not a circumstance that justifies equitable \ntolling.\u201d). Therefore, the City\u2019s policy is akin to the \nemployment practice at issue in Ricks, not Ledbetter. \nIn Ricks, \u201cthe only alleged discrimination occurred\u2013\nand \nthe \nfiling \nlimitations \nperiods \ntherefore \ncommenced\u2013at the time the tenure decision was made \nand communicated to Ricks.\u201d 449 U.S. at 258. \u201cThat is \nso even though one of the effects of the denial of \ntenure\u2013the eventual loss of a teaching position\u2013did \nnot occur until later.\u201d Id. For such acts, \u201cthe clock \nstarts running when the plaintiff first knew or should \nhave known of his injury, whether or not he realized \nthe cause of his injury was unlawful.\u201d Almond, 665 \nF.3d at 1176.  \nTo extend the Ledbetter Act under the facts of this \ncase would open the floodgates to stale claims over \nknown, written personnel policies and publicly \nannounced ordinances. And it would allow plaintiffs to \ndelay suit indefinitely, despite knowing exactly when \na benefit will end, by arguing that the claim \u201cre-\naccrues\u201d every month that the plaintiff does not \nreceive the benefit. See, e.g., Lohrasbi v. Bd. of \nTrustees of the Univ. of Illinois, 147 F. Supp. 3d 746, \n755 (C.D. Ill. 2015) (\u201c[T]he 300-day time-limit does not \nrestart each day that Plaintiff is deprived of Professor \nEmiritus status.\u201d). The Ledbetter Act has no place \nhere and any claims that allegedly accrued during \nPetitioner\u2019s employment have long-since expired and \nbeen waived.    \n\n27 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nII. The \nCircuit \nSplit \nQuestion \nRegarding \nDiscrimination Post-Employment \nThis Court should only resolve the question \nsplitting the circuit courts: whether totally disabled \nretirees are \u201cqualified individuals\u201d entitled to seek \nrelief under Title I for discrimination occurring \nentirely post-employment. The Eleventh Circuit below \n(at Pet. App. 11a-12a) and \u201cthe majority of courts have \nheld, Title I is unambiguous; by its plain language, it \ndoes not\u201d prohibit discrimination against \u201cformer \nemployees who are unable to perform the essential \nfunctions of their jobs.\u201d McKnight v. Gen. Motors \nCorp., 550 F.3d 519, 528 (6th Cir. 2008); Morgan v. \nJoint Admin. Bd., 268 F.3d 456, 458\u201359 (7th Cir. \n2001); Weyer v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp., 198 \nF.3d 1104, 1112 (9th Cir. 2000).   \nOnly two circuits have disagreed and held that \nTitle I is ambiguous because it allegedly fails to \n\u201cspecify when a potential plaintiff must have been a \n\u2018qualified individual\u2019...\u201d Castellano v. City of New York, \n142 F.3d 58, 67 (2d Cir. 1998) (emphasis in original); \nFord v. Schering-Plough Corp., 145 F.3d 601, 606 (3d \nCir. 1998). The Third Circuit also found an ambiguity, \nnot in the text, but in the \u201cdisjunction between the \nADA\u2019s definition of \u2018qualified individual with a \ndisability\u2019 and the rights that the ADA confers.\u201d Ford, \n145 F.3d at 605. \nAs \nthe \nEleventh \nCircuit \nexplained \nbelow \n\u201c[n]either court established that the text of Title I\u2019s \nanti-discrimination provision is ambiguous.\u201d Pet. App. \n12a. \u201cInstead, the Second and the Third Circuit \nexpressed \nsomething \nbetween \ndiscomfort \nand \ndisagreement with the policy choice underlying the \n\n28 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nline, drawn by the text of the ADA, between disabled \nindividuals who hold or desire to hold a job and those \nwho do not.\u201d Pet. App. 12a. \u201cBut not \u2018even the most \nformidable policy arguments\u2019 empower a court to \nignore unambiguous text.\u201d Id. (citation omitted). And \nthat text plainly prohibits discrimination solely \nagainst individuals who \u201ccan perform the essential \nfunctions\u201d of the job \u201cthat such individual holds or \ndesires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12111(8), 12112(a). \nA. Title I requires an individual to hold or \ndesire \na \njob \nat \nthe \ntime \nof \nthe \ndiscriminatory act to be a \u201cqualified \nindividual.\u201d \nThe first step \u201cin interpreting a statute is to \ndetermine whether the language at issue has a plain \nand unambiguous meaning with regard to the \nparticular dispute in the case.\u201d Robinson v. Shell Oil \nCo., 519 U.S. 337, 340 (1997). \u201cThe plainness or \nambiguity of statutory language is determined by \nreference to the language itself, the specific context in \nwhich that language is used, and the broader context \nof the statute as a whole.\u201d Id. at 341. \n1. \nThe text uses the present tense as a \ntemporal \nqualifier \nto \nprohibit \ndiscrimination solely against an \nindividual who \u201ccan perform\u201d the \njob she presently \u201cholds or desires.\u201d      \na. Title I\u2019s anti-discrimination provision (the \n\u201cgeneral rule\u201d) and its incorporated definition of a \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d are unambiguous. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 \n12112(a), 12111(8). The \u201cgeneral rule\u201d makes it \nunlawful for an employer to \u201cdiscriminate against a \n\n29 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nqualified individual on the basis of disability in regard \nto \njob \napplication \nprocedures, \nthe \nhiring, \nadvancement, or discharge of employees, employee \ncompensation, \njob \ntraining, \nand \nother \nterms, \nconditions, and privileges of employment.\u201d Id. \u00a7 \n12112(a).  \nSection 12111(8) defines a \u201cqualified individual\u201d \nas \u201can individual who, with or without reasonable \naccommodation, can perform the essential functions of \nthe employment position that such individual holds or \ndesires.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12111(8). Because the general rule \nexpressly incorporates the definition of a \u201cqualified \nindividual,\u201d an \u201cADA plaintiff bears the burden of \nproving that she is...a person \u2018who, with or without \nreasonable accommodation, can perform the essential \nfunctions\u2019 of her job,\u201d Cleveland v. Policy Mgmt. Sys. \nCorp., 526 U.S. 795, 806 (1999), at the time of the \nprohibited discrimination. (emphasis added).  \n\u201cCongress\u2019 use of a verb tense is significant in \nconstruing statutes.\u201d United States v. Wilson, 503 U.S. \n329, 333 (1992). For example, the ADA\u2019s use of \u201cthe \npresent indicative verb form\u201d requires \u201cthat a person \nbe presently\u2026substantially limited in order to \ndemonstrate a disability.\u201d Sutton v. United Air Lines, \nInc., 527 U.S. 471, 482 (1999), superseded, in part, on \nother grounds, ADAAA of 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-325, \u00a7 \n2(b)(3) (emphasis added); Dictionary Act, 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 \n(\u201cIn determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, \nunless the context indicates otherwise...words used in \nthe present tense include the future as well as the \npresent\u201d\u2014not the past). \nSection 12112(a) does not prohibit discrimination \nagainst an individual who performed the job that such \n\n30 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nindividual held or desired. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12112(a), \n12111(8). The present tense is used to require that an \nindividual be able to perform her job at the time of the \ndiscrimination.  \nThis is not to say that a former employee can \nnever sue under Title I. The Eleventh Circuit held she \nmay sue if her claim is based \u201con an act committed by \nthe defendant while the plaintiff was either working \nfor the defendant or seeking to work for the \ndefendant.\u201d Pet. App. 8a-9a. This is because the \ngeneral rule does not require a former employee to be \na \u201cqualified individual\u201d at the time of the lawsuit. See \nid. \u00a7 12112(a). Its focus is on the individual\u2019s \nqualifications at the time of the discriminatory act \nbecause it speaks only in terms of the prohibited \ndiscrimination\u2014not when suit is filed. Id. Any \nmischaracterization of the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s holding \nto categorically exclude retirees from suing under \nTitle I, must be rejected. It correctly held that \n\u201c[b]ecause Stanley cannot establish that the City \ncommitted any discriminatory acts against her while \nshe could perform the essential functions of a job that \nshe held or desired to hold, her Title I claim fails.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 18a.  \nb. This Court\u2019s decision in Robinson reinforces the \nsignificance of present tense verbs as \u201ctemporal \nqualifiers\u201d to limit the scope of a statute\u2019s protection \nto current employees. 519 U.S. at 341-42 & n. 2. The \nquestion in Robinson was whether the word \n\u201cemployees\u201d in Title VII\u2019s anti-retaliation provision, \u00a7 \n704(a), includes former employees. Id. at 339. Section \n704(a) makes it unlawful \u201cfor an employer to \ndiscriminate against any of his employees or \n\n31 \n\u0003\n\u0003\napplicants for employment\u201d who have availed \nthemselves of Title VII\u2019s protections or assisted others \nin so doing. Id. Section 701(f) defines \u201cemployee\u201d as \n\u201can individual employed by an employer.\u201d Id. at 342 \n(emphasis added).  \nThis Court explained that certain features of \u00a7 \n704(a) made it ambiguous and militated in favor of \nreading it to include former employees. Id. at 341. \nFirst, this Court emphasized that \u201cthere is no \ntemporal qualifier\u201d in \u00a7 704(a). Id. Second, the \ndefinition of \u201cemployees\u201d in \u00a7 701(f) was consistent \nwith either current or past employment because the \nword \u201cemployed\u201d used therein could mean \u201cis \nemployed\u201d or \u201cwas employed.\u201d Id. at 342 (emphasis in \noriginal). Thus, this Court concluded that like \u00a7 \n704(a), the definition of \u201cemployees\u201d in \u00a7 701(f) \u201clacks \nany temporal qualifier.\u201d Id.  \nOn this critical \u201ctemporal qualifier\u201d point, this \nCourt distinguished its decision just one month earlier \nin Walters v. Metro. Educational Enters., 519 U.S. 202 \n(1997). Id. at 341 n. 2. In Walters, this Court \nunanimously held that \u201cemployees\u201d as used in \u00a7 701(b) \nrelating to the 15-employee threshold for coverage by \nTitle \nVII, \nunambiguously \nreferred \nto \ncurrent \nemployees only. 519 U.S. at 341, n.2. This was because \n\u00a7 701(b) clearly included \u201ctwo significant temporal \nqualifiers.\u201d Id. This Court noted \u00a7 701(b)\u2019s language \nstating that Title VII \u201capplies to any employer \u2018who \nhas fifteen or more employees for each working day\u2026\u2019\u201d \nId. (emphasis in original). \u201cThe emphasized words \nspecify the time frame in which the employment \nrelationship must exist, and thus the specific context \nof that section did not present the particular \n\n32 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nambiguity at issue in the present case.\u201d Id. Indeed, \u00a7 \n701(b)\u2019s use of the present-tense as a temporal \nqualifier was critical in distinguishing the facts of \nRobinson. \nThe majority of courts have thus correctly \nconcluded that \u201cTitle I, unlike the section of Title VII \nat issue in Robinson, has a \u2018temporal qualifier.\u2019\u201d \nWeyer, 198 F.3d at 1112. Because \u00a7 12111(8) \u201cuses the \npresent tense...one must be able to perform the \nessential functions of employment at the time that one \nis discriminated against.\u201d Id. Section 12111(8)\u2019s other \ntemporal qualifiers reinforce this conclusion. It also \nrefers in the present tense to \u201cthe employment \nposition that such individual holds or desires.\u201d 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8) (emphasis added). The ADA, \ntherefore, has more in common with the provision that \nthis Court limited to current employees in Walters \nthan to the anti-retaliation provision distinguished in \nRobinson.  \n2. \nThe \nspecific \ncontext \nin \nwhich \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d is used within \nthe anti-discrimination provision \nshows \nthat \nit \nprohibits \ndiscrimination solely against those \nwho presently hold or desire jobs.    \nAfter examining the language itself, we next look \nto the \u201cspecific context in which that language is used\u201d \nto discern its meaning. Robinson, 519 U.S. at 341. The \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition is used within the \nanti-discrimination provision. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12112(a), \n12111(8). Petitioner\u2019s incorrect interpretation of Title \nI derives from her narrow focus on the \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d definition completely out of context from \n\n33 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nthe general rule where the definition appears. A \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d means an individual who \u201ccan \nperform the essential functions\u201d of the job she \u201cholds \nor desires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8). Petitioner argues \nthat the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of the \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d definition is to protect employers from \nbeing compelled to hire or retain unqualified \nindividuals by \u201ctesting\u201d an employee's capabilities. \nPet. Br. 34. And so, she argues if an individual has no \njob, an employer has no interest in the individual\u2019s \nability to perform and thus the \u201ccan perform\u201d clause \ncan be ignored. Id. 24, 34-35.  \nThis argument barely holds water when the \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition is read in a vacuum. \nIt completely fails when the definition is read within \nthe general rule where it appears. Indeed, \u201c[t]he \nquestion isn\u2019t just what [qualified individual] mean[s], \nbut what [Title I] says about it.\u201d Bostock, 590 U.S. at \n656. Read in context, the general rule prohibits \ndiscrimination solely against an individual who can \nperform the job she holds or desires. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n12111(8), 12112(a).  \nAnd so, the primary purpose of this anti-\ndiscrimination rule is not to protect the hiring \nprerogatives of employers, but to protect certain \ndisabled individuals from discrimination: those who \npresently work, want to work and can work despite \ntheir disabilities. See Tyndall v. Nat'l Educ. Centers, \nInc. of California, 31 F.3d 209, 215 (4th Cir. 1994) \n(\u201c[T]he primary purpose of the ADA...[is] to encourage \nemployers to take on qualified individuals, regardless \nof their disability.\u201d). Title I was intended to \u201cdraw \nworkers with a disability into the workforce.\u201d Morgan, \n\n34 \n\u0003\n\u0003\n268 F.3d at 458 (emphasis added). Its \u201clanguage [is] \nwell designed to help people get and keep jobs, not to \nhelp those no longer able to work get disability pay.\u201d \nWeyer, 198 F.3d at 1112; see also Pet. App. 8a (the \nADA\u2019s \u201ccentral purpose\u201d is \u201cprotecting disabled people \nwho can nevertheless perform the essential functions \nof a job\u201d). Indeed, drawing the disabled into the \nworkforce would save \u201cthe United States billions of \ndollars in unnecessary expenses resulting from \ndependency and nonproductivity.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n12101(8) (emphasis added).  \nThus, \nthe \nprimary \npurpose \nof \nthe \nanti-\ndiscrimination rule is to prohibit employers from \ndiscriminating \nagainst \ncurrent \nemployees \nand \napplicants who can work despite their disabilities\u2014\nnot to impose a \u201ctest\u201d on employees that they either \n\u201cpass,\u201d \u201cfail,\u201d or in the case of retirees, are allegedly \nexempt from taking. See Pet. Br. 34. By interpreting \nthe definition of a \u201cqualified individual\u201d in a vacuum, \nPetitioner commits the same error as the Second \nCircuit \ndid \nin \nCastellano. \nThere, \ndespite \nacknowledging that it must consider \u201cthe specific \ncontext in which that language is used,\u201d the court \nskipped that step, isolated the definition, and \nconcluded that it failed \u201cto specify when a potential \nplaintiff must have been a \u2018qualified individual with a \ndisability\u2019...\u201d 142 F.3d at 67 (emphasis in original). It \nthen \u201cmanufactured ambiguity where none existed.\u201d \nMcKnight, 550 F.3d at 527.  \nHad the Castellano court read the definition in \ncontext as used in the general rule, it would have \nrealized that the statute says exactly when an \nindividual must be qualified. A violation only arises if \n\n35 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nan employer discriminates against a \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d and thus if one is not qualified at the time \nof the discrimination there is no violation and no \nclaim. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a). By focusing on those who \n\u201ccan perform\u201d jobs they \u201chold or desire\u201d Congress \nlimited the statute\u2019s protections to current employees \nand applicants.  \nEven considering the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of the \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition as narrowly defined \nby Petitioner to protect employers from being forced to \nhire or retain unqualified individuals, Petitioner\u2019s \nargument fails. \u201c[E]xcept in the rare case of an obvious \nscrivener\u2019s error, purpose\u2014even purpose as most \nnarrowly defined\u2014cannot be used to contradict text or \nto supplement it.\u201d A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading \nLaw: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 57 (2012) \n(\u201cScalia & Garner\u201d). Petitioner\u2019s argument that the \npurpose of the \u201ccan perform\u201d clause should be deemed \n\u201csatisfied\u201d in the case of retirees is nothing more than \na request for this Court to rewrite the text to include \nan exception to the \u201ccan perform\u201d clause for retirees.  \nAnd regardless of whether an employer is \nconcerned with a retiree\u2019s ability to perform, Congress \nwas concerned solely with protecting those who \u201ccan \nperform.\u201d If an individual is totally disabled or no \nlonger holds or desires their position, the statute is \nsilent as to discrimination against that individual. \nPetitioner presumes, based on nothing, that the \nstatute must say something about retirees who do not \nhold or desire their jobs. But a \u201cjudge should not \npresume that every statute answers every question, \nthe answers to be discovered through interpretation.\u201d \nScalia & Garner, 93.  \n\n36 \n\u0003\n\u0003\n\u201c[T]he limitations of a text\u2014what a text chooses \nnot to do\u2014are as much a part of its \u2018purposes\u2019 as its \naffirmative dispositions.\u201d Id. at 57 (emphasis in \noriginal). These \u201climitations must be respected, and \nthe only way to accord them their due is to reject the \nreplacement or supplementation of text with purpose.\u201d \nId. at 57-58. Title I expressly limits its protections to \nthose who can perform the jobs they hold or desire. \nThere are no exceptions, and this Court should not \nalter the plain language to make any to appease \nPetitioner\u2019s policy preferences.  \n3. \nTitle \nI\u2019s \ndistinction \nbetween \n\u201cqualified \nindividuals\u201d \nand \n\u201cindividuals\u201d \nis \nconsistent \nthroughout the statutory scheme.   \nThe ADA\u2019s \u201cstatutory scheme is coherent and \nconsistent.\u201d Robinson, 519 U.S. at 340. The ADA\u2019s use \nof \u201cqualified individual\u201d does not vary in different \nprovisions. In Robinson, on the other hand, this Court \nfound that the word \u201cemployee\u201d included former \nemployees in at least some provisions of Title VII. Id. \nat 342-43. Having found \u00a7 704(a) ambiguous, this \nCourt considered what interpretation would be most \nconsistent with that section's purpose. In doing so, this \nCourt emphasized that \u00a7 704(a) was an anti-\nretaliation provision that by its nature would be \n\u201ceffectively vitiate[d]\u201d if it were confined to current \nemployees. Id. at 345. However, the ambiguities and \npolicy concerns that drove this Court\u2019s analysis of Title \nVII\u2019s anti-retaliation provision do not exist under Title \nI of the ADA.  \nTitle I does not protect against retaliation. The \nADA prohibits retaliation under Title V. See 42 U.S.C. \n\n37 \n\u0003\n\u0003\n\u00a7 12203(a) (it is unlawful for any employer \u201cto \ndiscriminate against any individual because such \nindividual has opposed any act or practice made \nunlawful by this chapter...\u201d) (emphasis added). Thus, \nthe concerns that impelled this Court to a broad \nconstruction of Title VII\u2019s anti-retaliation provision \nare not present here, because the ADA's anti-\nretaliation provision is expressly drawn to cover \u201cany \nindividual,\u201d not just the narrower subset of \u201cqualified \nindividuals\u201d covered by Title I. See Morgan, 268 F.3d \nat 458 (\u201cThe difference is stark.\u201d). Thus, when \nCongress wanted to prohibit discrimination against \ndisabled former employees, \u201cit did so clearly and \nexplicitly,\u201d Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U.S. 438, \n455 \n(2002), \nby \nreferring \nto \n\u201cindividuals\u201d\u2014not \n\u201cqualified individuals.\u201d \nB. Petitioner\u2019s contrary arguments lack \nmerit. \nAs described above, the Second and Third Circuits \nare the only circuits to side with Petitioner\u2019s \nargument. See supra Castellano and Ford. Recently, \nhowever, the Second Circuit acknowledged that \u201c[i]n \ngeneral, the determination of whether a person is \n\u2018qualified\u2019 should be made at the time of the \ndiscriminatory employment action,\u201d but in Castellano, \nthe court \u201ccreated a narrow exception to the rule for \npost-employment benefits intended to be used by \nretirees.\u201d Smith v. Town of Ramapo, 745 Fed. Appx. \n424, 426 (2d Cir. 2018) (emphasis added). Thus, even \nthe Second Circuit, albeit in an unpublished opinion, \nadmits that Castellano judicially-created a \u201cnarrow \nexception\u201d to the plain text of the rule articulated by \nCongress. Id.  \n\n38 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nPetitioner now rejects the Second and Third \nCircuit\u2019s finding of ambiguity in the \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d definition. She argues their judgments are \ndictated by the plain text of Title I, which she claims \nimposes only a \u201cconditional\u201d mandate that one be able \nto perform their job only if they hold or desire one. Pet. \nBr. 28. Despite this recasting of the argument, \nPetitioner is still guilty of the same cardinal sin of \nstatutory construction committed by the Second and \nThird Circuits. She too rewrites Title I by creating a \n\u201cnarrow exception\u201d to the \u201ccan perform\u201d clause just for \nretirees.  \n1. \nPetitioner\u2019s interpretation of the \nperformance requirement of the \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition as a \n\u201cconditional \nmandate,\u201d \nadds \nan \nunwritten \nexception \nto \nthat \nrequirement for retirees.    \na. The alleged \u201cconditional\u201d nature of the \nperformance requirement of the \u201cqualified individual\u201d \ndefinition cannot be divined from any part of the \nstatutory text. In support of this theory, Petitioner \nresorts to strained and unnatural constructions such \nas retirees are \u201cnot unable to perform the essential \nfunctions of a job that they hold or desire.\u201d Pet. Br. 34. \nShe admits \u201ctesting the job capabilities of someone \nwho is no longer working may seem logically \nawkward.\u201d Id. That is putting it mildly. But purported \nlogic aside, the text simply does not contain any \nlanguage conditioning the ability to perform on \nwhether a person holds or desires a job.  \nTitle I makes no exceptions to the \u201ccan perform\u201d \nclause. Courts should not \u201celaborate unprovided-for \n\n39 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nexceptions to a text\u2026\u2018[I]f the Congress [had] intended \nto provide...exceptions, it would have done so in clear \nlanguage.\u2019\u201d Scalia & Garner, 93. Petitioner improperly \nargues for a \u201ctacit exception,\u201d Bostock. 590 U.S. at 669, \nto Title I\u2019s \u201ccan perform\u201d clause. But \u201cwhen Congress \nchooses not to include any exceptions to a broad rule, \ncourts apply the broad rule.\u201d Id. \nThe correct reading of Title I to only prohibit \ndiscrimination against an individual who presently \nholds or desires a job that she can perform gives effect \nto all of the words in \u00a7\u00a7 12112(a) and 12111(8). \nPetitioner's interpretation, on the other hand, \nrequires the addition and subtraction of language \nfrom Title I. It does not, however, prohibit \ndiscrimination against an individual who can perform \nthe essential functions of the job only if she holds or \ndesires one. \nEven if Congress wanted to imply that the \nperformance requirement was conditioned upon an \nindividual having or wanting a job, Congress would \nnot have referred to \u201cthe employment position\u201d that \nsuch individual holds or desires. Id. \u00a7 12111(8) \n(emphasis added). By referring to \u201cthe employment \nposition\u201d the text clearly indicates that the job \ncurrently exists. Petitioner\u2019s reading replaces \u201cthe\u201d \nwith \u201can\u201d to read the definition as only requiring the \nability to perform if the individual has an employment \nposition. This addition and subtraction of text cannot \nbe countenanced by this Court.  \nPetitioner argues Congress did not include \u201can\u201d \ninstead of \u201cthe\u201d because that would have made the \nstatute too confusing. Pet. Br. 44. As already \ndiscussed, Congress knew exactly how to expand the \n\n40 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nADA\u2019s protections to other individuals besides current \nemployees and applicants. See supra 36-37. It also \nwould have been a very simple matter for Congress to \ndo what the Second and Third Circuits did to Title I by \ninserting a \u201cnarrow exception\u201d to the \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d definition for retirees. Smith, 745 Fed. \nAppx. at 426. Congress did none of these things and \nPetitioner\u2019s arguments fail.  \nb. \nPetitioner\u2019s \n\u201cconditional \nmandate\u201d \ninterpretation opens the door to a host of new \n\u201cqualified individuals\u201d none of whom Congress \nintended to protect. It will create bizarre incentives for \nemployees to simply deny desiring a job or promotion \nto circumvent the requirement that they be able to \nperform it. An employee totally incapable of \nperforming a certain position could sue if she is not \ngiven the position because of her disability. So long as \nshe doesn\u2019t apply for the promotion or otherwise \nindicate that she \u201cdesires\u201d it, she can sue if a non-\ndisabled employee is given the position over her \ndespite her inability to perform the position because of \nher disability. Petitioner\u2019s \u201cconditional mandate\u201d test \nis unworkable and should be rejected.  \nc. While Petitioner argues that retirees are \n\u201cqualified individuals\u201d who need not satisfy the \u201ccan \nperform\u201d clause, the United States takes a different \napproach that also fails. U.S. Amicus Br. 30. It argues \npost-employment discrimination against a retiree \n\u201cretroactively\u201d changes the terms of employment and \nso \u201cit is naturally described as discrimination against \na qualified individual...even if the plaintiff is no longer \nemployed.\u201d Id. What the United States characterizes \nas a \u201cretroactive change\u201d to the terms of employment \n\n41 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nis actually just a breach of contract. No court would \never describe such a breach as a \u201cretroactive change\u201d \nto a contract. If it did, then all a breaching party would \nhave to do to \u201cretroactively change\u201d the terms of a \ncontract would be to breach it. This, of course, is \nabsurd.  \nAnd whether the changed term of employment is \na contractual term or just a privilege, is irrelevant. \nThere is no time machine that an employer travels in \nto alter the terms or privileges that existed during \nemployment. Those terms and privileges remain the \nsame regardless of any later refusal to honor them. \nTherefore, it is legally unsound to say that a present \nbreach is a past harm to a plaintiff when she was a \n\u201cqualified individual.\u201d A post-employment change only \naffects someone who is unqualified. Moreover, the \nchange happened during Petitioner\u2019s employment in \n2003, but she waived any such claim. So the United \nStates\u2019 argument is purely hypothetical.  \nThe United States primarily argues for reversal \non the grounds Petitioner disclaimed. Its arguments \nfail for all the same reasons described above in Part I. \nIts focus on the alleged discrimination occurring \nduring employment confirms Title I\u2019s purpose to \nprohibit such acts during, not after, employment.  \n \n\n42 \n\u0003\n\u0003\n2. \nPetitioner\u2019s interpretation of the \n\u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d \ndefinition \nsolely \nas \na \nscreen \nto \nprotect \nemployers renders \u00a7\u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A), \n(b)(6), (b)(7), and (d)(2) superfluous. \nPetitioner argues that \u00a7\u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A), (b)(6), \n(b)(7), and (d)(2) allegedly all do the same work as the \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition by allowing employers \nto take actions against disabled employees that \u201care \njustified in relation to the operation of their business.\u201d \nPet. Br. 31. But if these subsections of \u00a7 12112 perform \nthis function, then the same function allegedly \nperformed by \u00a7 12111(8) is rendered superfluous. \nInstead, \u00a7 12111(8) as used in the general rule, tells \nemployers who they may not discriminate against\u2014\nthose who hold or want jobs they can perform\u2014but \nthen \u00a7\u00a7 12112(b) and (d)(2) provide exceptions to that \ngeneral prohibition for the protection of the business.  \nAccordingly, \nPetitioner\u2019s \nreliance \non \nthese \nsubsections undermines her argument and proves the \nCity\u2019s point that the general rule sets forth its limited \nprotection of current employees and applicants who \ncan perform despite their disabilities, but then \u00a7\u00a7 \n12112(b) and (d) include exceptions to that general \nprohibition to allow an employer to discriminate \nagainst these \u201cqualified individuals\u201d where it is \nnecessary to protect the business. \n \n\n43 \n\u0003\n\u0003\n3. \nThe \nEleventh \nCircuit\u2019s \ninterpretation does not render \u00a7 \n12112(b)(5)(A) superfluous.  \nPetitioner argues that if the \u201cqualified individual\u201d \ndefinition excludes those who do not hold or desire a \njob, then \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A)\u2019s reference to an \u201cotherwise \nqualified individual with a disability who is an \napplicant or employee\u201d is surplusage. Pet. Br. 32-33. \nShe is incorrect. \nSection 12112(b) is the \u201cconstruction\u201d provision \nexplaining that the term \u201cdiscriminate against a \nqualified individual on the basis of disability,\u201d \nincludes several forms of discrimination. Section \n12112(b) is replete with references to \u201ca job applicant \nor employee,\u201d sometimes repeating that phrase \nmultiple times within one subsection. See, e.g., \u00a7 \n12112(b)(1). Section 12112(b)(2) also repeats the \nreference to a \u201cqualified applicant or employee\u201d even \nthough it is defining what is included in the term \n\u201cdiscriminate against a qualified individual.\u201d Id. \u00a7 \n12112(b)(2). Likewise, \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(B) refers to a \u201cjob \napplicant or employee who is an otherwise qualified \nindividual with a disability.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(B).  \nThe repetition of these phrases serves only to \nemphasize how important it was to Congress that a \nplaintiff have an actual, present relationship with an \nemployer, as an employee or job applicant, to sue. \nWhile a \u201cqualified individual\u201d may be someone who \nmerely \u201cdesires\u201d a job under \u00a7 12111(8), \u00a7 12112(b) \nclarifies that the individual must actually apply for a \njob to establish a sufficient relationship to the \nemployer to justify imposing obligations on the \nemployer under the ADA. There is no surplusage \n\n44 \n\u0003\n\u0003\ncaused by the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s correct reading of \nTitle I.  \nBut even assuming that the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s \ninterpretation renders the phrase \u201capplicants and \nemployees\u201d in \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A) somehow superfluous, \nthat should not alter the conclusion. \u201cThe canon \nagainst surplusage is not an absolute rule.\u201d Marx v. \nGeneral Revenue Corp., 568 U.S. 371, 385 (2013). \n4. \nPetitioner\u2019s arguments regarding \ncommon usage, grammar and logic \nrely on false analogies.  \nBy focusing on the definition of a \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d in isolation, Petitioner concocts several \nfalse \nanalogies \nin \nsupport \nof \nher \nstrained \ninterpretation. When the definition is read out of \ncontext, it is stripped of its meaning and malleable to \nPetitioner\u2019s many unhelpful hypotheticals. She posits \na movie theater rule: \u201cYou can\u2019t watch the movie \nunless you silence your cell phone.\u201d Pet. Br. 35. She \nstates if you don\u2019t have a phone surely you don\u2019t \nviolate the rule. Id. This rule is not analogous at all to \nTitle I. \nThis rule imposes a prohibition on the patron\u2014\nnot the movie theater. And the prohibition against the \npatron is imposed by the movie theater\u2014not a \nregulator of the movie theater and so the intent behind \nthe rule is not analogous to Title I. When the theater \nis the one imposing the restriction, its intent is to \nprotect other patrons from disruption by noisy cell \nphones. But if a patron does not hold a cell phone, then \nthe theater\u2019s concern is not implicated. So, of course, \nthe theater will let you in if you don\u2019t have a cell \n\n45 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nphone. After all, its motivation is to sell as many \ntickets as possible so long as the ticket holders are not \ndisturbing others.  \nBut a proper analogy to Title I would require a \nhypothetical rule that says, \u201cno movie theater shall \nrefuse entry to an individual who can silence the cell \nphone that such individual holds.\u201d If a patron doesn\u2019t \nhold a cell phone, then under this properly analogous \nrule, the theater can grant the patron entry if it wants, \nbut nothing in the rule prohibits the movie theater \nfrom refusing that patron entry. This is because the \nonly thing that is prohibited by the regulator is refusal \nof entry to people who hold cells phones that can be \nsilenced. The focus, from the regulator\u2019s perspective, \nis clearly on protecting people with cell phones.  \nAt first blush, it may seem strange that this \nfictional regulator did not prohibit discrimination \nagainst people without cell phones, but not once we \nrealize that the regulator enacted the rule with the \nprotection of people with cell phones in mind. Perhaps \nthe regulator was concerned with making sure people \nwith cell phones can still attend movies and did not \nwant theaters to reject them solely because their cell \nphones could disturb others. So long as the cell phone \ncan be silenced, the regulator prohibits movie theaters \nfrom refusing entry to people with cell phones.  \nSimilarly, under Title I, when we realize that \nCongress was concerned only with protecting those \nwho work or want to work, we can see the clear \npurpose of the \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition within \nthe anti-discrimination rule to prohibit discrimination \nsolely against those individuals as long as they can \nperform despite their disabilities. It was not concerned \n\n46 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nwith anyone else in this one statute. It doesn\u2019t mean \nthat employers have a license to discriminate against \nretirees. There are several other laws that would \nprohibit such misconduct. Disabled retirees may face \nchallenges, but Title I \u201cneed not address all aspects of \na problem in one fell swoop; policymakers may focus \non their most pressing concerns.\u201d Williams-Yulee v. \nFlorida Bar, 575 U.S. 433, 449 (2015). \nPetitioner provides other purported analogies all \nsuffering from the same flaw as her movie theater \nhypothetical. Their structure does not mimic Title I\u2019s \nstructure and are thus useless to this Court. For \nexample, her \u201ccommand\u201d analogy fails because \nCongress did not make a command to an employee. \nPet. Br. 39. She argues \u201cWhen a command is \nconditional, its condition may be either overt or \nexplicit.\u201d Id. The command, \u201cDrive carefully!\u201d is \nconditioned on the subject of that command to be in \nthe act of driving. But Congress did not command an \nemployee to \u201cPerform your job!\u201d If it did, then perhaps \nwe could say that an employee must perform only if \nshe has a job. The \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition, \nhowever, does not appear within a command directed \nat an employee. It appears within the anti-\ndiscrimination provision commanding employers not \nto discriminate against individuals who can perform \ntheir jobs.  \nNo matter how many expedient hypotheticals \nPetitioner poses, there is only one way this Court can \nreach her desired outcome\u2014by creating an exception, \njust for retirees, to the plain language prohibiting \ndiscrimination solely against those who can perform \ntheir jobs. \n\n47 \n\u0003\n\u0003\n \n5. \nPetitioner\u2019s \nargument \nthat \nher \ninterpretation is consistent with \nTitle VII and avoids surplusage and \nabsurd consequences, fails. \na. The Eleventh Circuit\u2019s interpretation \ndoes not render the \u201ccompensation\u201d clause of \u00a7 \n12112(a) superfluous. Simply because Title I \nprotects \n\u201ccompensation,\u201d \nincluding \nretirement \nbenefits, does not mean that Title I was designed to \n\u201cprotect \nretirees\u201d \nfrom \npost-employment \ndiscrimination. Pet. Br. 46. The purpose of the \n\u201ccompensation\u201d clause cannot be pursued at the \nexpense of negating Title I\u2019s plain text, especially \nwhen there are numerous circumstances where the \nreference to \u201ccompensation\u201d can be given effect \nwithout \nnullifying \nthe \n\u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d \nlimitations.  \nBecause litigants can sue employers who adopt \ndiscriminatory fringe benefits policies during their \nemployment when they are \u201cqualified individuals,\u201d \neffect can be given to the \u201ccompensation\u201d clause \nwithout \nnegating \nthe \n\u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d \nrequirements. \u201cCompensation\u201d and \u201cfringe benefits\u201d \ncan include a variety of benefits received during \nemployment such as health insurance, vacation pay, \novertime pay, and sick leave. While retirement \nbenefits might be among the items that make up the \nuniverse of compensation or benefits, they are not the \nexclusive or the most important benefit. Because \nemployees who satisfy the plain language of the \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition receive multiple types \nof \u201ccompensation\u201d and \u201cbenefits,\u201d the inclusion of \n\n48 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nthose terms in Title I can be given effect without \nrewriting \u00a7 12111(8). \nThe fact that retirees cannot sue regarding \ndiscriminatory benefits and compensation in every \nscenario does not render Title I\u2019s references to \n\u201ccompensation\u201d superfluous. \u201cNo text pursues its \npurposes at all costs.\u201d Scalia & Garner, 57; Clifford F. \nMacEvoy Co. v. U.S. for Use & Benefit of Calvin \nTomkins Co., 322 U.S. 102, 107 (1944) (even a \u201chighly \nremedial\u201d \nstatute \n\u201centitled \nto \na \nliberal \nconstruction\u2026does not justify ignoring plain words of \nlimitation.\u201d). This \u201cCourt cannot construe a statute in \na way that negates its plain text, and here, Congress \nexpressly limited,\u201d Honeycutt v. United States, 581 \nU.S. 443, 454 n. 2 (2017), Title I\u2019s protections to those \nwho can perform the jobs they hold or desire.  \nb. In the context of a \u201cqualified individual,\u201d \nTitle I and Title VII are not analogous. Petitioner \nargues that her interpretation of Title I would \nmaintain \u201ccongruity between the ADA and Title VII, \nthe statute on which much of title I was \u2018modeled.\u2019\u201d \nPet. Br. 46. While Title I \u201cborrows much of its \nprocedural \nframework \nfrom \n[T]itle \nVII...by \nincorporating title VII's enforcement provisions,\u201d Title \nI \u201cborrows much of its substantive framework from \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.\u201d \nH.R.Rep. No. 101\u2013485(III), at 31 (1990) (emphasis \nadded). The \u201cconcept\u201d of a \u201cqualified individual\u201d who \nmust be able to perform the \u201cessential functions\u201d of her \njob comes from \u201cthe regulations implementing...the \nRehabilitation Act\u201d\u2014not Title VII. Id. at 33. \nThere is no counterpart to the \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d definition in Title VII, so loose references \n\n49 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nto Title VII and the ADA as \u201csibling statutes,\u201d Ford, \n145 F.3d at 606, obscure these important differences \nin the text. Although Title VII and the ADA may be \nclosely related in other respects, on the issue here \u201cthe \nstatutes are not analogous.\u201d Weyer, 198 F.3d at 1111. \nc. Petitioner\u2019s reliance on the absurd results \ntest fails. Petitioner argues there is no plausible \nexplanation for the \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition to \nexclude retirees and she invokes the \u201cabsurd results\u201d \ntest. Pet. Br. 46-47. This \u201cCourt rarely invokes such a \ntest to override unambiguous legislation.\u201d Barnhart, \n534 U.S. at 459. This test is stringent and states \u201cthe \nabsurdity must consist of a disposition that no \nreasonable person could intend.\u201d Scalia & Garner, \n237.  \nHere, there are \u201cseveral explanations for why \nCongress would have purposefully exempted\u201d retirees \nfrom the statute\u2019s coverage. Barnhart, 534 U.S. at 459. \n\u201cCongress could reasonably decide to enable disabled \npeople who can work with reasonable accommodation \nto get and keep jobs, without also deciding to equalize \npost-employment fringe benefits for people who \ncannot work.\u201d Weyer, 198 F.3d at 1112. \u201cCongress has \nthe authority to improve the circumstances of disabled \npeople in some respects even if it does not improve \nthem in all respects.\u201d Id. \u201cLegislation often results \nfrom a delicate compromise among competing \ninterests and concerns.\u201d Id. at 1113; Barnhart, 534 \nU.S. \nat \n461 \n(any \n\u201cdissatisfaction\u201d \nwith \nthe \nconsequences of plain text is \u201coften the cost of \nlegislative compromise.\u201d). \u201cIf we were to \u2018fully \neffectuate\u2019 what we take to be the underlying policy of \nthe legislation, without careful attention to the \n\n50 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nqualifying words in the statute, then we would be \noverturning \nthe \nnuanced \ncompromise \nin \nthe \nlegislation, and substituting our own cruder, less \nresponsive mandate for the law that was actually \npassed.\u201d Weyer, 198 F.3d at 1113. \nTitle I, thus, reasonably prohibits employers from \ndiscriminating solely \u201cagainst people with disabilities \nthat do not prevent job performance, but when a \ndisability renders a person unable to perform the \nessential functions of the job, that disability renders \nhim or her unqualified.\u201d Stevens v. Rite Aid Corp., 851 \nF.3d 224, 229 (2d Cir. 2017). When the perceived gap \nin Title I for the protection of retirees is understood for \nwhat it really is\u2014important compromise that \nfacilitates action on the more pressing problems of the \nday\u2014the consequences of Title I\u2019s plain language are \nnot at all \u201csurprising\u201d or \u201cabsurd.\u201d Pet. Br. 27, 47. \nCongress enacted Title I to provide a legal remedy \nfor disabled workers that did not previously exist. See \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(a)(4). At the time, several other \nfederal statutes existed for the protection of employee \nretirement benefits such as ERISA, the Social \nSecurity Act, and the Medicare Act. The Equal \nProtection Clause provided an additional remedy for \npublic employees. See Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, \n522 (2004) (\u201cemphasiz[ing] that the House and Senate \nCommittee \nReports \non \nthe \nADA \nfocused \non \n\u2018[d]iscrimination [in]...employment in the private \nsector,\u2019 and made no mention of discrimination in \npublic employment.\u201d) (emphasis added by the Court). \nAdditionally, numerous common law claims such as \nbreach of contract, promissory estoppel, or fraud in the \ninducement \nalong \nwith \nstate \nstatutory \nand \n\n51 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nunconstitutional takings claims could be brought to \nobtain promised benefits.  \nThus, before the ADA, a disabled employee could \nnot sue her private employer for discrimination, \nbreach of contract, or any of the other above remedies \nif she accepted a job knowing that her contract \nincluded a lesser pension than a similarly situated \nnon-disabled employee. And even if she didn\u2019t know \nabout a secret discriminatory decision applied to her \nduring her employment but later discovered it, there \nwas no law that prohibited such discrimination. The \nADA stepped in to prohibit such discriminatory \npolicies from being applied to current employees and \napplicants. Such policies could dissuade a disabled job \napplicant from accepting that job or force a disabled \nemployee to search elsewhere for a fair pension. And \nin the absence of the ADA, that employee would be \nforced to do so without remedy. Title I\u2019s \u201clanguage [is] \nwell \ndesigned \nto \nhelp \npeople \nget \nand \nkeep \njobs\u2026\u201dWeyer, 198 F.3d at 1112. \nBut an employer who does not discriminate until \npost-employment does not deter employment. If the \nemployer has a facially neutral pension policy that \npromises a pension to all retirees, but the employer \nwithholds the pension from a disabled retiree, then \nthat retiree has a clear breach of a contract claim \nalong with all of the other remedies mentioned above \nunder ERISA, the Social Security Act, etc. Under \nFlorida law, \u201conce a participating member reaches \nretirement status, the benefits under the terms of the \nact in effect at the time of the employee's retirement \nvest.\u201d Bien, 209 So. 3d at 3. \u201cThe contractual \nrelationship may not thereafter be affected or \n\n52 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nadversely \naltered \nby \nsubsequent \nstatutory \nenactments.\u201d Id. \nThus, the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s interpretation does \nnot \u201callow employers to freely discriminate against \ntheir former employees.\u201d Pet. Br. 47. Employers risk \nsignificant liability for allowing their animus against \nthe disabled to lead them to breach their contracts or \nviolate other laws post-employment. The remedies for \nviolating these laws are not always the same as the \nADA\u2019s remedies. But the fact that these remedies pre-\ndated the ADA demonstrates the reasonableness of \nCongress\u2019 decision to focus on the more pressing issue \nof the day for which there was no remedy at all\u2014\ndiscriminatory \npolicies \nthat \nexcluded \ncapable \nindividuals from the workforce simply because they \nwere disabled. Because there are several plausible \nexplanations for the line drawn by the plain text of \nTitle I, Petitioner\u2019s arguments fail the absurd results \ntest. The Eleventh Circuit correctly held that \nPetitioner could not state a claim for disability \ndiscrimination under the ADA.\u0003\n\u0003\n \n\n53 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nCONCLUSION \nFor these reasons, this Court should affirm.  \n \nRespectfully submitted, \nJESSICA C.

Or a \nuniversity that pays a pension to former employees, but \nnot if they\u2019re Jewish. Such blatant discrimination is \nunquestionably actionable under Title VII of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964. No court would entertain the notion \nthat former employees are barred from challenging these \nodious policies solely because they no longer hold their \njobs. To the contrary, this Court has unanimously held \nthat Title VII\u2019s protections extend to former employees. \nRobinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337 (1997).  \nThe Americans with Disabilities Act is no different. \nCongress explicitly modeled the ADA on Title VII. It \nconferred Title VII\u2019s full \u201cpowers, remedies, and \nprocedures\u201d on ADA plaintiffs, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12117(a), and \nestablished comprehensive \u201ccivil rights protections for \npersons with disabilities that are parallel to\u201d Title VII. \nH.R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 3, at 48 (1990).  \nIn this case, the Eleventh Circuit upended Congress\u2019s \ndesign by holding that a retired firefighter disabled in the \nline of duty may be subjected to discrimination with \nimpunity. That holding is fundamentally mistaken in two \nrespects, each of which independently warrants reversal. \n \nFirst, the court misread what the ADA, as amended \nby the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, says about who may \nsue, what they may sue over, and when they may sue.  \nThe ADA\u2019s enforcement provision tells us who may \nsue: \u201cany person alleging discrimination on the basis of \ndisability in violation of [the Act].\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12117(a). \nThat does not exclude retirees.  \n\n- 2 - \n \nThe statute also tells us what retirees may sue over: \nthe ADA, like Title VII, bans discrimination in \n\u201ccompensation\u201d and \u201cterms, conditions, and privileges of \nemployment\u201d\u2014words this Court has long read to include \npost-employment benefits over which retirees may sue. \nHishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U.S. 69, 77 (1984).  \nAnd, most importantly, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay \nAct clarifies when discrimination occurs and when a \nplaintiff may sue: when a benefits policy is \u201cadopted,\u201d or \nwhen the plaintiff \u201cbecomes subject to\u201d it, or when the \nplaintiff \u201cis affected by\u201d it. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A). \nThe ADA thus prohibits discrimination on the basis of \ndisability in the provision of a benefit earned during a \nplaintiff\u2019s employment\u2014even if the plaintiff does not \nreceive that benefit until she is no longer employed. \nTogether, these provisions\u2014who, what, when\u2014make \nclear that the Eleventh Circuit was wrong to preclude the \npetitioner here from invoking the ADA\u2019s protections. The \nallegedly discriminatory policy at issue was adopted in \n2003, while Lt. Karyn Stanley was still employed and able \nto perform her job as a firefighter and was therefore \nindisputably what the statute calls a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d \nThus, even if she needed to be employed when the alleged \ndiscrimination occurred\u2014as the court below erroneously \nconcluded\u2014she was, and her suit may proceed. \nSecond, the Eleventh Circuit erred in holding that \nretirees are not \u201cqualified individuals\u201d under the ADA. \nA \u201cqualified individual means an individual who, with \nor without reasonable accommodation, can perform the \nessential functions of the employment position that such \nindividual holds or desires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2111(8). The court \nof appeals read this to mean that one must \u201chold or desire\u201d \na job. But that isn\u2019t what the statute says and, at the very \n\n- 3 - \n \nleast, isn\u2019t a reading demanded by the statute\u2019s words or \nsyntax. To see why, try some examples:   \n\u2022 \u201cA \u2018cleared passenger\u2019 means a passenger who can \ncomplete an x-ray screening of the luggage that \nsuch passenger carries or checks. Only \u2018cleared \npassengers\u2019 may board the aircraft.\u201d Can you get \non the plane if you don\u2019t have any bags?  \n\u2022 \u201cYou must silence your cell phone to visit the \nlibrary.\u201d May you visit if you didn\u2019t bring a phone?  \n\u2022 \u201cTo live in this apartment building, you must be \nable to clean up after the pets that you own.\u201d If you \ndon\u2019t own a pet, may you live in the building? \nIn each case, we naturally understand this language to \nmean that certain requirements apply conditionally\u2014only \nif the relevant condition (carrying luggage, bringing a \nphone, owning pets) is met does it trigger an obligation \n(screen bags, silence your phone, clean up). In the pets \nexample, \u201cthat you own\u201d tells us which pets\u2014the ones you \nown. The \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition works the same \nway: It requires you to be able to perform the functions of \na job only to the extent that you \u201chold\u201d or \u201cdesire\u201d one. \nBut nothing in the text requires that you currently \n\u201chold\u201d or \u201cdesire\u201d a job. It would be eccentric to read the \npets rule to mean: \u201cYou must own a pet.\u201d But that\u2019s akin \nto what the court did here. It rewrote the statute to impose \ntwo requirements rather than one: you (a) must hold or \ndesire a job and (b) must be able to perform its functions. \nThis redrafting transforms how the statute works. The \nADA prohibits discrimination \u201cagainst a qualified \nindividual on the basis of disability.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12112(a). The \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition\u2019s role in the statutory \nscheme is to make clear that employers don\u2019t violate that \n\n- 4 - \n \nrule when they make necessary job-related decisions\u2014\ninsisting that a lifeguard be able to swim, for example. The \ndefinition is not there, however, to arbitrarily exclude \nentire categories of people from the Act\u2019s protection.  \nTo be sure, we concede that syntax alone doesn\u2019t \nanswer the question, and that Congress could have been \nclearer. But \u201cin its legal context,\u201d Pulsifer v. United \nStates, 601 U.S. 124, 141 (2024), the definition is best read \nto require that, to the extent that an individual holds a job, \nthey must be able to perform its essential functions. That \nreading aligns with common usage, grammar, and logic, as \nwell as the ADA\u2019s text, structure, and purpose. It \nharmonizes the ADA with Title VII, as Congress \nintended. It avoids unnecessary surplusage. And it avoids \nthe absurd result of leaving retirees unprotected against \neven the most egregious discrimination in the distribution \nof valuable benefits that they earned during their careers.  \nThe consequences of the contrary reading are starkly \nillustrated here. Lt. Stanley served as a firefighter for \nnearly two decades, risking life and limb to protect her \ncommunity. The benefits she seeks to protect were earned \nthrough years of dedicated, dangerous service. Yet under \nthe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s rule, she loses protections that \nwould have safeguarded those benefits\u2014at the moment \nthe protections matter most. This perverse outcome would \npull the rug out from under firefighters, police officers, \nteachers, and others who become disabled through years \nof service to their communities and country.  \nCongress never enacted this arbitrary regime, which \nmakes outright discrimination unlawful up until an \nemployee\u2019s last day of work\u2014and then perfectly lawful \nthe moment she clocks out for the last time. This Court \nshould reverse. \n\n- 5 - \n \nOPINIONS BELOW  \nThe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s opinion is reported at 83 F.4th \n1333 and reproduced at App. 1. The district court\u2019s order \nis unreported but is available at 2021 WL 6333059 and \nreproduced at App. 20. \nJURISDICTIONAL STATEMENT \nThis Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nThe Eleventh Circuit entered judgment on October 11, \n2023. A petition was timely filed on March 8, 2024, and the \nCourt granted certiorari on June 24, 2024. \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED  \nThe relevant provisions of the ADA are reproduced in \na statutory appendix to this brief.  \nSTATEMENT  \nA. \nStatutory background  \n\u201cCongress enacted the ADA in 1990 to remedy \nwidespread discrimination against disabled individuals.\u201d \nPGA Tour, Inc. v. Martin, 532 U.S. 661, 674 (2001). \nCongress found that, \u201chistorically, society has tended to \nisolate and segregate individuals with disabilities,\u201d and \n\u201cdespite some improvements,\u201d that discrimination \n\u201ccontinue[d] to be a serious and pervasive social problem.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(a)(2). It \u201cpersist[ed] in such critical \nareas as employment,\u201d \u201caccess to public services,\u201d and \n\u201cpublic accommodations,\u201d among others. Id. \u00a7 12101(a)(3). \nIn view of those findings, the ADA provides \u201ca clear \nand comprehensive national mandate for the elimination \nof discrimination against individuals with disabilities\u201d with \n\u201cclear, \nstrong, \nconsistent, \nenforceable \nstandards \naddressing discrimination.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12101(b)(1)\u2013(2). And \n\u201c[t]o effectuate its sweeping purpose, the ADA forbids \ndiscrimination against disabled individuals in major areas \n\n- 6 - \n \nof public life,\u201d including, in Title I, employment. Martin, \n532 U.S. at 675. \n1. Title I\u2019s discrimination provision. In keeping with \nthe ADA\u2019s \u201cbroad mandate\u201d and \u201ccomprehensive\u201d \napproach, Martin, 532 U.S. at 675, Title I establishes an \nexpansive approach to what constitutes disability \ndiscrimination in employment. \na. The general rule. Section 12112 sets out a \u201cgeneral \nrule\u201d governing discrimination: \u201c[N]o covered entity shall \ndiscriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of \ndisability in regard to job application procedures, the \nhiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee \ncompensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, \nand privileges of employment.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a). This \nreaches discrimination from before employment begins \n(\u201capplication procedures\u201d and \u201chiring\u201d) through in-role \nperformance \n(\u201cadvancement\u201d) \nto \ntermination \n(\u201cdischarge\u201d) and all the way through to post-employment \nbenefits that \u201caccrue\u201d after \u201ca person\u2019s employment is \ncompleted.\u201d Hishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U.S. 69, 77 \n(1984) (interpreting Title VII). As this Court put it when \ninterpreting identical language in Title VII, \u201c[t]here is no \nquestion\u201d that this prohibition extends to cover \n\u201cretirement benefits.\u201d Ariz. Governing Comm. for Tax \nDeferred Annuity & Deferred Comp. Plans v. Norris, 463 \nU.S. 1073, 1081 (1983) (Marshall, J., joined by Brennan, \nWhite, Stevens, and O\u2019Connor, JJ.). The upshot of this \ncomprehensive list of the \u201cincidents of employment\u201d is \nthat, if something is \u201cpart and parcel of the employment \nrelationship,\u201d the ADA shields it from discrimination. \nHishon, 467 U.S. at 75. \nb. The construction provision. Title I couples the \nreach of its \u201cgeneral rule\u201d with a flexible \u201c[c]onstruction\u201d \nprovision that explains what \u201c\u2018discriminate against a \n\n- 7 - \n \nqualified individual on the basis of disability [in the \ngeneral rule] includes.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b). That \nprovision makes clear that, like all anti-discrimination \nstatutes, Title I prohibits animus-based disparate \ntreatment. See, e.g., id. \u00a7 12112(b)(1). It also reaches \npolicies that have a disparate impact on people with \ndisabilities, specifically singling out \u201cstandards, criteria, \nor methods of administration that have the effect of \ndiscrimination on the basis of disability,\u201d id. \u00a7 \n12112(b)(3)(A), and \u201cstandards\u201d that \u201ctend to screen \nout \u2026 a class of individuals with disabilities,\u201d id. \u00a7 \n12112(b)(6). \nBut, unlike most other anti-discrimination statutes, \nthe ADA doesn\u2019t equate \u201cdiscriminate\u201d with an equal-\ntreatment mandate. Instead, it at times requires \n\u201cpreferential[]\u201d treatment to \u201cachieve [its] basic equal \nopportunity goal.\u201d US Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. \n391, 397 (2002). The \u201cconstruction\u201d provision accomplishes \nthis by defining \u201cdiscriminate\u201d to include the failure to \nprovide a \u201creasonable accommodation.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A). This affirmative mandate can demand \nsignificant changes: \u201cjob restructuring,\u201d \u201cmodified work \nschedules,\u201d \n\u201creassignment,\u201d \nthe \nmodification \nof \nequipment and \u201cfacilities\u201d to make them \u201creadily \naccessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities,\u201d \nand \u201cother similar accommodations.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12111(9). \nc. The \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition. While the \nsweep of the discrimination provision demonstrates the \nADA\u2019s \nplan \nto \naggressively \nroot \nout \ndisability \ndiscrimination in employment, Congress also sought to \nensure that Title I would not \u201cdemand action beyond the \nrealm of the reasonable.\u201d Barnett, 535 U.S. at 401. A \nnumber of its provisions thus balance the Act\u2019s ambitions \nagainst employers\u2019 legitimate interests: The Act requires \n\n- 8 - \n \nonly \u201creasonable\u201d accommodations and carves out \naccommodations that impose \u201cundue hardship\u201d on \nemployers, see, e.g., 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A), and it \nprovides a \u201cbusiness necessity\u201d defense against disparate-\nimpact discrimination stemming from \u201cstandards, tests, \nor selection criteria,\u201d id. \u00a7 12113(a). \nChief among these provisions is the general rule\u2019s \nprohibition \nof \ndiscrimination \nagainst \n\u201cqualified \nindividuals.\u201d A \u201cqualified individual\u201d is defined as \u201can \nindividual \nwho, \nwith \nor \nwithout \nreasonable \naccommodation, can perform the essential functions of the \nemployment position that such individual holds or \ndesires.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12111(8). The role of this definition\u2014and its \nplacement in the general rule\u2014is to \u201creaffirm\u201d that Title \nI \u201cdoes not undermine an employer\u2019s ability to choose and \nmaintain qualified workers.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 2, \nat 55 (1990). An employer, for instance, may refuse to hire \nsomeone whose disability prevents them (even with the \nbenefit of an accommodation) from \u201clift[ing] fifty pounds\u201d \nif doing so is necessary for performing the job. H.R. Rep. \nNo. 101-485, at 56. Title I thus allows employers cabined \nauthority to act on the basis of disability; they may do so \nonly to ensure that the people they hire can perform the \ncore, or \u201cessential,\u201d functions of the job at issue\u2014a limited \nrole that the definition of \u201cqualified individual\u201d \nunderscores by requiring deference to the \u201cemployer\u2019s \njudgment as to what functions of a job are es\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Or a \nuniversity that pays a pension to former employees, but \nnot if they\u2019re Jewish. Such blatant discrimination is \nunquestionably actionable under Title VII of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964. No court would entertain the notion \nthat former employees are barred from challenging these \nodious policies solely because they no longer hold their \njobs. To the contrary, this Court has unanimously held \nthat Title VII\u2019s protections extend to former employees. \nRobinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337 (1997).  \nThe Americans with Disabilities Act is no different. \nCongress explicitly modeled the ADA on Title VII. It \nconferred Title VII\u2019s full \u201cpowers, remedies, and \nprocedures\u201d on ADA plaintiffs, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12117(a), and \nestablished comprehensive \u201ccivil rights protections for \npersons with disabilities that are parallel to\u201d Title VII. \nH.R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 3, at 48 (1990).  \nIn this case, the Eleventh Circuit upended Congress\u2019s \ndesign by holding that a retired firefighter disabled in the \nline of duty may be subjected to discrimination with \nimpunity. That holding is fundamentally mistaken in two \nrespects, each of which independently warrants reversal. \n \nFirst, the court misread what the ADA, as amended \nby the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, says about who may \nsue, what they may sue over, and when they may sue.  \nThe ADA\u2019s enforcement provision tells us who may \nsue: \u201cany person alleging discrimination on the basis of \ndisability in violation of [the Act].\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12117(a). \nThat does not exclude retirees.  \n\n- 2 - \n \nThe statute also tells us what retirees may sue over: \nthe ADA, like Title VII, bans discrimination in \n\u201ccompensation\u201d and \u201cterms, conditions, and privileges of \nemployment\u201d\u2014words this Court has long read to include \npost-employment benefits over which retirees may sue. \nHishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U.S. 69, 77 (1984).  \nAnd, most importantly, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay \nAct clarifies when discrimination occurs and when a \nplaintiff may sue: when a benefits policy is \u201cadopted,\u201d or \nwhen the plaintiff \u201cbecomes subject to\u201d it, or when the \nplaintiff \u201cis affected by\u201d it. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A). \nThe ADA thus prohibits discrimination on the basis of \ndisability in the provision of a benefit earned during a \nplaintiff\u2019s employment\u2014even if the plaintiff does not \nreceive that benefit until she is no longer employed. \nTogether, these provisions\u2014who, what, when\u2014make \nclear that the Eleventh Circuit was wrong to preclude the \npetitioner here from invoking the ADA\u2019s protections. The \nallegedly discriminatory policy at issue was adopted in \n2003, while Lt. Karyn Stanley was still employed and able \nto perform her job as a firefighter and was therefore \nindisputably what the statute calls a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d \nThus, even if she needed to be employed when the alleged \ndiscrimination occurred\u2014as the court below erroneously \nconcluded\u2014she was, and her suit may proceed. \nSecond, the Eleventh Circuit erred in holding that \nretirees are not \u201cqualified individuals\u201d under the ADA. \nA \u201cqualified individual means an individual who, with \nor without reasonable accommodation, can perform the \nessential functions of the employment position that such \nindividual holds or desires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2111(8). The court \nof appeals read this to mean that one must \u201chold or desire\u201d \na job. But that isn\u2019t what the statute says and, at the very \n\n- 3 - \n \nleast, isn\u2019t a reading demanded by the statute\u2019s words or \nsyntax. To see why, try some examples:   \n\u2022 \u201cA \u2018cleared passenger\u2019 means a passenger who can \ncomplete an x-ray screening of the luggage that \nsuch passenger carries or checks. Only \u2018cleared \npassengers\u2019 may board the aircraft.\u201d Can you get \non the plane if you don\u2019t have any bags?  \n\u2022 \u201cYou must silence your cell phone to visit the \nlibrary.\u201d May you visit if you didn\u2019t bring a phone?  \n\u2022 \u201cTo live in this apartment building, you must be \nable to clean up after the pets that you own.\u201d If you \ndon\u2019t own a pet, may you live in the building? \nIn each case, we naturally understand this language to \nmean that certain requirements apply conditionally\u2014only \nif the relevant condition (carrying luggage, bringing a \nphone, owning pets) is met does it trigger an obligation \n(screen bags, silence your phone, clean up). In the pets \nexample, \u201cthat you own\u201d tells us which pets\u2014the ones you \nown. The \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition works the same \nway: It requires you to be able to perform the functions of \na job only to the extent that you \u201chold\u201d or \u201cdesire\u201d one. \nBut nothing in the text requires that you currently \n\u201chold\u201d or \u201cdesire\u201d a job. It would be eccentric to read the \npets rule to mean: \u201cYou must own a pet.\u201d But that\u2019s akin \nto what the court did here. It rewrote the statute to impose \ntwo requirements rather than one: you (a) must hold or \ndesire a job and (b) must be able to perform its functions. \nThis redrafting transforms how the statute works. The \nADA prohibits discrimination \u201cagainst a qualified \nindividual on the basis of disability.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12112(a). The \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition\u2019s role in the statutory \nscheme is to make clear that employers don\u2019t violate that \n\n- 4 - \n \nrule when they make necessary job-related decisions\u2014\ninsisting that a lifeguard be able to swim, for example. The \ndefinition is not there, however, to arbitrarily exclude \nentire categories of people from the Act\u2019s protection.  \nTo be sure, we concede that syntax alone doesn\u2019t \nanswer the question, and that Congress could have been \nclearer. But \u201cin its legal context,\u201d Pulsifer v. United \nStates, 601 U.S. 124, 141 (2024), the definition is best read \nto require that, to the extent that an individual holds a job, \nthey must be able to perform its essential functions. That \nreading aligns with common usage, grammar, and logic, as \nwell as the ADA\u2019s text, structure, and purpose. It \nharmonizes the ADA with Title VII, as Congress \nintended. It avoids unnecessary surplusage. And it avoids \nthe absurd result of leaving retirees unprotected against \neven the most egregious discrimination in the distribution \nof valuable benefits that they earned during their careers.  \nThe consequences of the contrary reading are starkly \nillustrated here. Lt. Stanley served as a firefighter for \nnearly two decades, risking life and limb to protect her \ncommunity. The benefits she seeks to protect were earned \nthrough years of dedicated, dangerous service. Yet under \nthe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s rule, she loses protections that \nwould have safeguarded those benefits\u2014at the moment \nthe protections matter most. This perverse outcome would \npull the rug out from under firefighters, police officers, \nteachers, and others who become disabled through years \nof service to their communities and country.  \nCongress never enacted this arbitrary regime, which \nmakes outright discrimination unlawful up until an \nemployee\u2019s last day of work\u2014and then perfectly lawful \nthe moment she clocks out for the last time. This Court \nshould reverse. \n\n- 5 - \n \nOPINIONS BELOW  \nThe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s opinion is reported at 83 F.4th \n1333 and reproduced at App. 1. The district court\u2019s order \nis unreported but is available at 2021 WL 6333059 and \nreproduced at App. 20. \nJURISDICTIONAL STATEMENT \nThis Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nThe Eleventh Circuit entered judgment on October 11, \n2023. A petition was timely filed on March 8, 2024, and the \nCourt granted certiorari on June 24, 2024. \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED  \nThe relevant provisions of the ADA are reproduced in \na statutory appendix to this brief.  \nSTATEMENT  \nA. \nStatutory background  \n\u201cCongress enacted the ADA in 1990 to remedy \nwidespread discrimination against disabled individuals.\u201d \nPGA Tour, Inc. v. Martin, 532 U.S. 661, 674 (2001). \nCongress found that, \u201chistorically, society has tended to \nisolate and segregate individuals with disabilities,\u201d and \n\u201cdespite some improvements,\u201d that discrimination \n\u201ccontinue[d] to be a serious and pervasive social problem.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(a)(2). It \u201cpersist[ed] in such critical \nareas as employment,\u201d \u201caccess to public services,\u201d and \n\u201cpublic accommodations,\u201d among others. Id. \u00a7 12101(a)(3). \nIn view of those findings, the ADA provides \u201ca clear \nand comprehensive national mandate for the elimination \nof discrimination against individuals with disabilities\u201d with \n\u201cclear, \nstrong, \nconsistent, \nenforceable \nstandards \naddressing discrimination.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12101(b)(1)\u2013(2). And \n\u201c[t]o effectuate its sweeping purpose, the ADA forbids \ndiscrimination against disabled individuals in major areas \n\n- 6 - \n \nof public life,\u201d including, in Title I, employment. Martin, \n532 U.S. at 675. \n1. Title I\u2019s discrimination provision. In keeping with \nthe ADA\u2019s \u201cbroad mandate\u201d and \u201ccomprehensive\u201d \napproach, Martin, 532 U.S. at 675, Title I establishes an \nexpansive approach to what constitutes disability \ndiscrimination in employment. \na. The general rule. Section 12112 sets out a \u201cgeneral \nrule\u201d governing discrimination: \u201c[N]o covered entity shall \ndiscriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of \ndisability in regard to job application procedures, the \nhiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee \ncompensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, \nand privileges of employment.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a). This \nreaches discrimination from before employment begins \n(\u201capplication procedures\u201d and \u201chiring\u201d) through in-role \nperformance \n(\u201cadvancement\u201d) \nto \ntermination \n(\u201cdischarge\u201d) and all the way through to post-employment \nbenefits that \u201caccrue\u201d after \u201ca person\u2019s employment is \ncompleted.\u201d Hishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U.S. 69, 77 \n(1984) (interpreting Title VII). As this Court put it when \ninterpreting identical language in Title VII, \u201c[t]here is no \nquestion\u201d that this prohibition extends to cover \n\u201cretirement benefits.\u201d Ariz. Governing Comm. for Tax \nDeferred Annuity & Deferred Comp. Plans v. Norris, 463 \nU.S. 1073, 1081 (1983) (Marshall, J., joined by Brennan, \nWhite, Stevens, and O\u2019Connor, JJ.). The upshot of this \ncomprehensive list of the \u201cincidents of employment\u201d is \nthat, if something is \u201cpart and parcel of the employment \nrelationship,\u201d the ADA shields it from discrimination. \nHishon, 467 U.S. at 75. \nb. The construction provision. Title I couples the \nreach of its \u201cgeneral rule\u201d with a flexible \u201c[c]onstruction\u201d \nprovision that explains what \u201c\u2018discriminate against a \n\n- 7 - \n \nqualified individual on the basis of disability [in the \ngeneral rule] includes.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b). That \nprovision makes clear that, like all anti-discrimination \nstatutes, Title I prohibits animus-based disparate \ntreatment. See, e.g., id. \u00a7 12112(b)(1). It also reaches \npolicies that have a disparate impact on people with \ndisabilities, specifically singling out \u201cstandards, criteria, \nor methods of administration that have the effect of \ndiscrimination on the basis of disability,\u201d id. \u00a7 \n12112(b)(3)(A), and \u201cstandards\u201d that \u201ctend to screen \nout \u2026 a class of individuals with disabilities,\u201d id. \u00a7 \n12112(b)(6). \nBut, unlike most other anti-discrimination statutes, \nthe ADA doesn\u2019t equate \u201cdiscriminate\u201d with an equal-\ntreatment mandate. Instead, it at times requires \n\u201cpreferential[]\u201d treatment to \u201cachieve [its] basic equal \nopportunity goal.\u201d US Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. \n391, 397 (2002). The \u201cconstruction\u201d provision accomplishes \nthis by defining \u201cdiscriminate\u201d to include the failure to \nprovide a \u201creasonable accommodation.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A). This affirmative mandate can demand \nsignificant changes: \u201cjob restructuring,\u201d \u201cmodified work \nschedules,\u201d \n\u201creassignment,\u201d \nthe \nmodification \nof \nequipment and \u201cfacilities\u201d to make them \u201creadily \naccessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities,\u201d \nand \u201cother similar accommodations.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12111(9). \nc. The \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition. While the \nsweep of the discrimination provision demonstrates the \nADA\u2019s \nplan \nto \naggressively \nroot \nout \ndisability \ndiscrimination in employment, Congress also sought to \nensure that Title I would not \u201cdemand action beyond the \nrealm of the reasonable.\u201d Barnett, 535 U.S. at 401. A \nnumber of its provisions thus balance the Act\u2019s ambitions \nagainst employers\u2019 legitimate interests: The Act requires \n\n- 8 - \n \nonly \u201creasonable\u201d accommodations and carves out \naccommodations that impose \u201cundue hardship\u201d on \nemployers, see, e.g., 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A), and it \nprovides a \u201cbusiness necessity\u201d defense against disparate-\nimpact discrimination stemming from \u201cstandards, tests, \nor selection criteria,\u201d id. \u00a7 12113(a). \nChief among these provisions is the general rule\u2019s \nprohibition \nof \ndiscrimination \nagainst \n\u201cqualified \nindividuals.\u201d A \u201cqualified individual\u201d is defined as \u201can \nindividual \nwho, \nwith \nor \nwithout \nreasonable \naccommodation, can perform the essential functions of the \nemployment position that such individual holds or \ndesires.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12111(8). The role of this definition\u2014and its \nplacement in the general rule\u2014is to \u201creaffirm\u201d that Title \nI \u201cdoes not undermine an employer\u2019s ability to choose and \nmaintain qualified workers.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 2, \nat 55 (1990). An employer, for instance, may refuse to hire \nsomeone whose disability prevents them (even with the \nbenefit of an accommodation) from \u201clift[ing] fifty pounds\u201d \nif doing so is necessary for performing the job. H.R. Rep. \nNo. 101-485, at 56. Title I thus allows employers cabined \nauthority to act on the basis of disability; they may do so \nonly to ensure that the people they hire can perform the \ncore, or \u201cessential,\u201d functions of the job at issue\u2014a limited \nrole that the definition of \u201cqualified individual\u201d \nunderscores by requiring deference to the \u201cemployer\u2019s \njudgment as to what functions of a job are essential,\u201d but \nnothing more. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8). \n2. Title I\u2019s enforcement provision. To vindicate its \nsubstantive prohibition on disability-based discrimination, \nTitle I adopted what was, by the time the ADA became \nlaw, a proven remedial mechanism. Section 12117, entitled \n\u201cEnforcement,\u201d provides that the \u201cpowers, remedies, and \nprocedures\u201d available under Title VII may be invoked by \n\n- 9 - \n \n\u201cany person alleging discrimination on the basis of \ndisability in violation of\u201d Title I. Id. \u00a7 12117(a). Even \nbefore the ADA was enacted, retirees had used those \nremedies and procedures to enforce their rights under \nTitle VII with respect to post-employment benefits. See, \ne.g., Florida v. Long, 487 U.S. 223, 225 (1988); Norris, 463 \nU.S. at 1074; City of Los Angeles, Dep\u2019t of Water & Power \nv. Manhart, 435 U.S. 702, 704 (1978).  \n3. The Fair Pay Act. Title VII\u2019s enforcement \nmechanism has since been expanded through the Lilly \nLedbetter Fair Pay Act. See Pub. L. No. 111-2, \u00a7 3, \n123 Stat. 5 (2009). That Act clarifies that an unlawful \nemployment practice \u201coccurs\u201d\u2014and thus restarts the \ntime to sue\u2014when:  \n(1) the \u201cdiscriminatory compensation decision or \nother practice is adopted,\u201d  \n(2) the person is \u201csubject to a discriminatory \ncompensation decision,\u201d or  \n(3) \u201cwhen an individual is affected by application of \na discriminatory compensation decision or other \npractice, including each time wages, benefits, or \nother compensation is paid.\u201d  \nId. \n\u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A). \nThis \nmeans \nthat \n\u201cevery \ndiscriminatory paycheck or other compensation resulting, \nin whole or in part, from an earlier discriminatory pay \ndecision or other practice\u201d is another occurrence for which \na person can seek redress. See H.R Rep. No. 110-237, at 3 \n(2007). \nB. \nFactual background \nIn 1999, after serving in the military, Karyn Stanley \nbegan her career as a firefighter for the City of Sanford, \nFlorida. Pet. App. 2a. In 2005, she was promoted to Fire \n\n- 10 - \n \nLieutenant. All told, Lt. Stanley served the City for almost \ntwo decades as a firefighter. Doc. 1 at 3.  \nWhen the City offered her the job, her employment \npackage included a \u201chealth insurance subsidy.\u201d Pet. App. \n3a. This benefit covered most of the cost of participating \nin the City\u2019s health-insurance plan. Id.; Doc. 1 at 5. So \nalthough Lt. Stanley\u2019s monthly health-insurance premium \nunder the City\u2019s health plan was approximately $1,300, the \nCity\u2019s subsidy covered $1,000 of that cost, requiring her to \npay only $300. The City told her that this benefit applied \nboth to current employees and to qualifying retirees until \nthey reached age sixty-five. Doc. 38-15 at 11. A retiree was \neligible regardless of whether she \u201cretire[d] with twenty-\nfive (25) years of service\u201d or \u201cretire[d] for disability \nreasons.\u201d Doc. 38-6 at 2; Pet. App. 21a.  \nThis health-insurance subsidy was an especially \nimportant benefit for firefighters like Lt. Stanley because \nthey have one of the \u201chighest rates of injuries and illnesses \nof all occupations.\u201d Bureau of Lab. Stats., Occupational \nOutlook Handbook, Firefighters, https://perma.cc/F8CP-\nUJL8. Indeed, for many critical public-service jobs that \ncome with lower salaries, post-employment benefits are a \nmajor draw for potential employees, representing an \nimportant part of the compensation for which they \nundertake (and stay in) their roles as police officers, \nfirefighters, or other first responders. See Bureau of Lab. \nStats., Employee Benefits, https://perma.cc/PLP6-7GHL. \nIn 2003, unbeknownst to Lt. Stanley, the City quietly \nchanged its subsidy policy to distinguish between \n\u201cdisabled\u201d and \u201cnormal\u201d retirees. Doc. 1 at 12. The new \npolicy changed the benefits eligibility for \u201call employees \nretiring as a result of full disability\u201d so that it would run \nonly \u201cuntil the disabled retiree receives Medicare benefits \n\n- 11 - \n \nor until 24 months have elapsed from the date of \nretirement, whichever comes first.\u201d Pet. App. 22a; Doc. \n38-11 at 4. By contrast, \u201cnormal retirees\u201d remained \neligible until age sixty-five. Doc. 39-16 at 13. So if a \nfirefighter is injured in the line of duty or develops a \ncareer-ending illness one year before she completes her \ntwenty-five years of service, the subsidy lasts for only \ntwenty-four months. \nThe City claimed that the new policy was a necessary \n\u201ccost cutting measure[].\u201d Doc. 38 at 7. But it never offered \nany justification for cutting costs associated with disabled \nemployees alone. The City\u2019s HR director had no \nexplanation, Doc. 39-4 at 10, 13\u201314, and it was unable to \nidentify any \u201cdata, mathematical calculations, [or] \ncorrespondence \u2026 upon which [it] based its decision\u201d to \nrescind benefits from disabled retirees and not \u201cnormal \nretirees.\u201d Doc. 39-16 at 5, 40. Indeed, city employees could \nnot even point to any \u201cfinancial estimates\u201d of \u201cthe cost of \ncontinuing the disability retirees[\u2019] [subsidy] longer than \n24 months\u201d before enacting the policy. Doc. 39-9 at 46. \nWhatever the reason for the change, the new policy \ndecimated Lt. Stanley\u2019s promised retirement benefits \nbecause her career as a firefighter was cut short by \nParkinson\u2019s disease. After nearly twenty years of service, \nLt. Stanley began to develop \u201cstiffness [and] rigidity \u2026 as \nwell as [a] loss of dexterity in her extremities.\u201d Doc. 38-4 \nat 3. In 2016, she was officially diagnosed with \nParkinson\u2019s. Pet. App. 2a. For a longtime firefighter like \nLt. Stanley, that diagnosis was tragic but not surprising. \nSome states have adopted a legal presumption that \nfirefighters who develop Parkinson\u2019s did so in the line of \nduty based on the frequency with which the disease afflicts \n\n- 12 - \n \nfirefighters. See N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law \u00a7 207-kkk (Consol.); \nInd. Code Ann. \u00a7 5-10-15-5.5.  \nFor two years after her diagnosis, Lt. Stanley \ncontinued to work as a lieutenant. Pet. App. 2a. But \neventually it became clear that Lt. Stanley\u2019s disability was \npreventing her from meeting the physical demands of her \njob. Pet. App. 2a. In 2018, at the age of forty-seven, Lt. \nStanley took disability retirement with the City\u2019s \nagreement. Pet. App. 2a. \nAt that point, Lt. Stanley expected the employer she \nhad served for almost twenty years to stand by the \nbargain that it had struck with her when she was hired. \nThe City had explained her original benefits package \nwhen she first joined, and it had never told her about any \nchange in policy. Doc. 38-15 at 9. She had never received \nan updated human resources manual explaining that she \nwould no longer receive the retirement benefits she was \nexpecting. Doc. 38-15 at 9, 11. But just twenty-four months \nafter she retired, the City discontinued Lt. Stanley\u2019s \nhealth-insurance \nsubsidy, \nleaving \nher \nfinancially \nresponsible for all of her health insurance. Pet. App. 3a.  \nFor the past few years, Lt. Stanley has paid out of \npocket for the entire cost of the City\u2019s health-insurance \npolicy, which she relies on for her Parkinson\u2019s treatment. \nDoc 39-9 at 23; Doc. 38-15 at 11, 21. The cost to Lt. Stanley \nof covering the $1,000 monthly subsidy until she is sixty-\nfive\u2014if she is even able to do so\u2014would be more than \n$150,000. Doc. 1 at 6\u20137. Due to the high cost of the City\u2019s \nhealth-insurance premium without the subsidy, no other \ndisabled retirees have been able to stay on the City\u2019s \ninsurance after the loss of the subsidy. Doc. 39-9 at 25; see \nDoc. 39-16 at 3\u20134. Non-disabled retirees, however, \n\n- 13 - \n \ntypically remain on the City\u2019s health insurance until they \nbecome eligible for Medicare. Doc. 39-4 at 69. \nC. Procedural background \nLt. Stanley filed this lawsuit alleging that the City\u2019s \npolicy violated the ADA. Pet. App. 24a. The district court \ndismissed Lt. Stanley\u2019s Title I claim. The court found itself \nbound by circuit precedent holding that a \u201cdisabled \nformer employee\u201d like Lt. Stanley has \u201cno standing to \nsue\u201d over post-employment benefits under Title I because \nshe is \u201cno longer\u201d a qualified individual. Pet. App. 24a. \nThe Eleventh Circuit affirmed. It held that Lt. \nStanley, as a former employee, could not sue about \ndiscrimination in her benefits under the ADA because she \nwas not a \u201cqualified individual\u201d at the time that the City \nterminated her subsidy payments in 2020. Pet. App. 11a\u2013\n12a. The court emphasized that section 12111(8) defines \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d using the \u201cpresent tense\u201d words \n\u201c[c]an,\u201d \u201cholds,\u201d and \u201cdesires.\u201d Pet. App. 11a. Thus, it \nheld, a plaintiff \u201cmust desire or already have a job with the \ndefendant at the time the defendant commits the \ndiscriminatory act.\u201d Id. And since Lt. Stanley was a \n\u201cretiree, not [an] employee,\u201d in 2020, she was not a \n\u201cqualified individual.\u201d Pet. App. 16a. \nThe panel further concluded that Lt. Stanley was not \na \u201cqualified individual\u201d at any other discrete moment in \nwhich discrimination could have occurred. Pet. App. 16a\u2013\n17a. The court announced that Lt. Stanley \u201cconcede[d]\u201d \nthat the City\u2019s change of the policy in 2003 could not \namount to actionable discrimination. Pet. App. 16a. And it \n\u201cagree[d]\u201d with Lt. Stanley\u2019s (alleged) concession that her \nclaim could not turn on the 2003 policy change because she \nwas \u201cnot yet disabled at that time.\u201d Id. Nor, the court \nreasoned, could Lt. Stanley\u2019s claim turn on the City\u2019s \n\n- 14 - \n \nactions in the period after she was diagnosed with \nParkinson\u2019s but before she retired because she (allegedly \nalso) \u201cconceded that \u2026 she was [not] impacted\u201d until after \nshe retired. Pet. App. 18a.  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI. The ADA permits former employees to sue over \npost-employment benefits.  \nThe who: The ADA\u2019s enforcement provision allows suit \nby \u201cany person alleging discrimination\u201d in violation of the \nAct who \u201cclaim[s] to be aggrieved.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12117(a), \n2000e-5(f)(1). This language doesn\u2019t limit suits to \n\u201cemployees,\u201d \u201capplicants,\u201d or \u201cqualified individuals.\u201d  \nThe what: The ADA targets discrimination not just in \nhiring \nand \nfiring \nbut \nalso \nin \n\u201cemployee \ncompensation \u2026 and \nother \nterms, \nconditions, \nand \nprivileges of employment.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12112(a). By the time the \nADA was enacted in 1990, this Court had already \ninterpreted Title VII\u2019s parallel language as protecting \nretirement benefits.  \nThe when: The Fair Pay Act further clarifies that \nretirees may bring suit under the ADA when they are \n\u201caffected by application of\u201d discriminatory benefits plans \n\u201cadopted\u201d while they were working. Id. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A). \nThis allows a plaintiff to challenge a decision to adopt a \ndiscriminatory benefits policy each time that she is \nadversely affected, even after her employment ends. So \neven if Ms. Stanley didn\u2019t feel the effects of the City\u2019s \npolicy until she retired, these provisions together make \nclear that her claim may proceed.  \nII. The court of appeals independently erred in holding \nthat the ADA protects only those who \u201chold[] or desire[]\u201d \na job. Nothing in the ADA\u2019s text requires that result, \n\n- 15 - \n \nwhich would leave retirees unprotected against even the \nmost egregious discrimination. \nThe ADA doesn\u2019t require a person to \u201chold[] or \ndesire[]\u201d a job to be a qualified individual. The definition \nasks if an individual \u201ccan perform the essential functions \nof the employment position that such individual holds or \ndesires.\u201d In other words, it tests if you can do a job, not if \nyou have or want one.  \nThis makes sense given the definition\u2019s role in the \nstatutory scheme: It affords employers necessary, but \ncircumscribed, flexibility to restrict employment on the \nbasis of disability to preserve the functioning of a \nbusiness. It allows employers to screen out people who \ncan\u2019t perform core job functions, not to implement \ndiscriminatory policies unrelated to job performance.  \nThis understanding avoids treating key statutory \nterms \nas \nsurplusage. \nThe \nADA\u2019s \nreasonable-\naccommodation provision applies to a \u201cqualified individual \nwith a disability who is an applicant or employee.\u201d Id. \n\u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A) (emphasis added). This tells us that the \nAct contemplates at least some qualified individuals who \nare neither applicants nor employees\u2014a category that \nwould not exist under the court of appeals\u2019 reading. \nCommon usage, grammar, and logic all show that the \ntext doesn\u2019t demand the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s reading. \nConsider this rule: \u201cAn individual may not watch the \nmovie unless the individual silences the electronic devices \nthat such individual carries.\u201d If you come to the theater \nwithout a device, can you stay? Of course. The rule \nrequires patrons to turn off their devices only to the extent \nthat they have them. The \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition \nworks the same way: It requires individuals to be able to \nperform essential job functions only to the extent they \nhold or desire jobs with such functions.  \n\n- 16 - \n \nEven granting that the \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition \ncould be read in a vacuum to support the Eleventh \nCircuit\u2019s view, ours is the better reading in the context of \nthe statute as a whole. Treating retirees as \u201cqualified \nindividuals\u201d allows the definition to fulfill its role in \nscreening out those who can\u2019t perform job functions, \nwithout turning it into an arbitrary license to discriminate. \nIt avoids rendering key language superfluous. It gives \nforce to the ADA\u2019s protections for retirement benefits. \nAnd it maintains congruity between the ADA and Title \nVII. In short, it is the reading that is far \u201cmore consistent \nwith the broader context of\u201d the Act and the \u201cprimary \npurpose\u201d of the definition. Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., \n519 U.S. 337, 346 (1997).  \nARGUMENT \n \nBy allowing employers to discriminate against \ndisabled retirees with impunity\u2014in ways that would never \nbe tolerated for race, religion, sex, or national origin\u2014the \nEleventh Circuit\u2019s decision frustrates Congress\u2019s plan for \na \u201ccomprehensive national mandate for the elimination of \ndiscrimination against individuals with disabilities.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(b)(1). The decision is flawed in two key \nrespects, each of which independently warrants reversal:  \n \nFirst, it fundamentally misunderstands the ADA\u2019s \ntext and structure. The ADA allows \u201cany person alleging \ndiscrimination\u201d to sue, including retirees who are later \n\u201caffected by the application of\u201d discriminatory policies \nthat were \u201cadopted\u201d while they were working. That \ndescription fits the allegations in this case to a T.  \n \nSecond, it misreads the ADA\u2019s \u201cqualified individual\u201d \ndefinition as excluding retirees from the Act\u2019s protection. \nThe text doesn\u2019t compel that reading, and an \u201cinquiry into \ntext and context\u201d makes the statute\u2019s contrary meaning \n\n- 17 - \n \nclear. Pulsifer v. United States, 601 U.S. 124, 141 (2024). \nReading the ADA to protect retirees makes sense of the \nscheme as a whole, harmonizes Title VII and the ADA, \navoids turning key provisions into surplusage, and escapes \nan outcome that puts the statute \u201cat war with itself.\u201d Groff \nv. DeJoy, 600 U.S. 447, 472 (2023). \nI. \nThe ADA permits former employees to bring suit \nwith respect to post-employment benefits. \nThe ADA permits retirees to sue over their benefits. \nThis conclusion follows from the ADA\u2019s enforcement \nprovision, its coverage of post-employment benefits, and \nthe Fair Pay Act\u2019s clarification of when plaintiffs may sue \nover benefits. Together they make clear that Lt. Stanley\u2019s \nsuit, which challenges a policy \u201cadopted\u201d while she was \nemployed, and to which she was \u201csubjected\u201d while \nworking for the City, may proceed. This Court therefore \nneed not even reach the court of appeals\u2019 erroneous \nholding that the Act only prohibits discrimination against \npeople who currently \u201chold[] or desire[]\u201d a job.  \nA. The who: The ADA\u2019s enforcement provision \nallows suit by \u201cany person alleging \ndiscrimination\u201d in violation of the Act. \nTo enforce the ADA\u2019s \u201cbroad mandate,\u201d Martin, \n532 U.S. at 674\u201375, section 12117, titled \u201cEnforcement,\u201d \nprovides \u201cto any person alleging discrimination on the \nbasis of disability in violation of\u201d Title I the full range of \nremedies provided for in Title VII. 42 U.S.C \u00a7 12117(a). \nNoticeably absent from this authority to sue is a \nrequirement that the plaintiff be a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d \nInstead, \u201cany person\u201d who alleges a discriminatory act in \nviolation of the statute can invoke Title VII\u2019s remedial \nframework. And that framework contains no relevant \nlimitation either: It allows any \u201cperson claiming to be \n\n- 18 - \n \naggrieved\u201d to bring a \u201ccivil action.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-\n5(f)(1).  \nDespite its breadth, Title VII\u2019s remedial provision \ndoes have its limits: Only plaintiffs who assert an \u201cinterest \narguably sought to be protected by the statute\u201d may \ninvoke these remedies. Thompson v. N. Am. Stainless, \nLP, 562 U.S. 170, 177\u201378 (2011). But this \u201czone-of-\ninterests\u201d test is \u201cnot meant to be especially demanding.\u201d \nMatch-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish \nBand \nof \nPottawatomi \nIndians v. Patchak, 567 U.S. 209, 224\u201325 (2012). It bars a \nplaintiff only if her asserted \u201cinterests are so marginally \nrelated to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the \nstatute that it cannot reasonably be assumed that \nCongress intended to permit the suit.\u201d Thompson, 562 \nU.S. at 178; see also, e.g., Bank of Am. Corp. v. City of \nMiami, 581 U.S. 189, 200 (2017) (holding that Miami could \nsue under the Fair Housing Act for financial injury \nincurred from discriminatory lending practices). Which is \nto say, this textual limitation cuts off only suits that are far \nafield from the statute\u2019s purposes\u2014for example, a \n\u201cshareholder\u201d suit against a corporation over its \u201cfiring \n[of] a valuable employee for racially discriminatory \nreasons.\u201d Thompson, 562 U.S. at 177. \nAssuming that the same zone-of-interest test applies, \nretirees in Lt. Stanley\u2019s shoes satisfy it. The ADA\u2019s \n\u201ccomprehensive\u201d mandate to \u201celiminat[e]\u201d discrimination, \n42 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 12101(b)(1), \naims \nnot \njust \nat \nthe \n\u201cpersist[ence]\u201d of discrimination in \u201cjobs,\u201d but also in the \ndistribution of \u201cbenefits,\u201d id. \u00a7 12101(a)(5). So there could \nbe no doubt that retirees\u2019 claims would fall within the Act\u2019s \nzone of interests. See Lexmark Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Static Control \nComponents, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 131 (2014) (explaining \nthat, when a statute contains a \u201cdetailed statement of [its] \n\n- 19 - \n \npurposes,\u201d no \u201cguesswork\u201d is required to determine the \nzone of interests). It\u2019s hard to imagine anyone better \nsituated to bring this claim\u2014over her benefits stemming \nfrom her job\u2014than Lt. Stanley. \nB. The what: The ADA protects against \ndiscrimination with respect to post-\nemployment benefits. \nThe ADA\u2019s substantive prohibitions\u2014the what\u2014also \nreach claims from retirees. The ADA specifically guards \nagainst discrimination in post-employment benefits. It \ntargets not just discrimination in hiring and firing but also \nforbids \u201cdiscriminat[ing] against a qualified individual on \nthe basis of disability in regard to \u2026 employee \ncompensation \u2026 and \nother \nterms, \nconditions, \nand \nprivileges of employment.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a). By the \ntime the ADA was enacted in 1990, this Court had already \nmade clear that Title VII\u2019s parallel language protected \npost-employment benefits. See, e.g., Hishon, 467 U.S. at \n77; Norris, 463 U.S. at 1081.   \nThat\u2019s because \u201c[a] benefit need not accrue before a \nperson\u2019s employment is completed\u201d to be protected. \nHishon, 467 U.S. at 77. What matters, instead, is that the \nbenefit is \u201cpart and parcel of the employment \nrelationship\u201d; if it is, it may not be \u201cdoled out in a \ndiscriminatory fashion.\u201d Id. at 75. That common-sense \nconclusion means that \u201c[t]here is no question\u201d that \n\u201cretirement benefits\u201d are protected. Norris, 463 U.S. at \n1079; see also Hishon, 467 U.S. at 77. In the twenty-five \nyears between Title VII\u2019s passage and the ADA\u2019s passage, \nthis Court repeatedly entertained Title VII claims about \npost-employment benefits. See Long, 487 U.S. at 225; \nNorris, 463 U.S. at 1074; Manhart, 435 U.S. at 705.  \n\n- 20 - \n \nWhen the ADA adopted Title VII\u2019s terminology, it \ncarried forward this settled meaning. \u201c[T]he enactment of \na new provision that mirrors the existing statutory text \nindicates \u2026 that the new provision has that same \nmeaning.\u201d Lightfoot v. Cendant Mortg. Corp., 580 U.S. 82, \n95 (2017). And the ADA\u2019s protection of post-employment \nbenefits is confirmed by other sections. For example, the \nADA prohibits employers from contracting with an \n\u201corganization providing fringe benefits\u201d in a way that \u201chas \nthe effect\u201d of discriminating on the basis of disability. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(2). \u201c[F]ringe benefits\u201d has a well-\naccepted meaning, and it encompasses post-employment \nbenefits. Howard Delivery Serv., Inc. v. Zurich Am. Ins. \nCo., 547 U.S. 651, 654 (2006); see also 135 Cong. Rec. \nS10712 (daily ed. Sept. 7, 1989) (statement of Sen. Harkin) \n(describing the hope that covered individuals would \u201clive \n[their] retirement years in dignity\u201d); Oversight Hearing \non H.R. 4498 before a Subcomm. of H. Comm. Educ. & \nLabor, 100th Cong. 2d Sess. 54 (1988) (describing the \nADA\u2019s focus on protecting disabled Americans\u2019 \u201cbenefits \nfor \u2026 health and retirement\u201d). \nAdd that all together, and it is clear that a retiree in \nLt. Stanley\u2019s position has a right to sue. Whether or not \nsuch a retiree is a \u201cqualified individual\u201d when they \nexperience the effects of the discrimination, they are a \ndisabled employee claiming that their employer applied a \ndiscriminatory policy (which the ADA prohibits) to strip \nthem of their benefits (which the ADA protects).  \nIn fact, a benefits policy that facially discriminates \nagainst people with disabilities\u2014everyone in the company \nreceives a pension, except for people with disabilities\u2014\nnecessarily runs afoul of the ADA. It obviously \n\u201cdiscriminate[s] \u2026 on the basis of disability.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\n- 21 - \n \n\u00a7 12112(a). And it does so with regard to \u201ccompensation,\u201d \nid., which is paid to people in exchange for their \n\u201cperform[ance of] the essential functions\u201d of an \n\u201cemployment position,\u201d id. \u00a7 12111(8).  \nIn other words, in understanding what the statute \nprotects, the \u201cqualified individual\u201d language is largely \nbeside the point in a case of this kind. As a general \nproposition, employers only pay \u201ccompensation\u201d to \n\u201cqualified individuals\u201d who \u201ccan perform the essential \nfunctions of the employment position that\u201d they \u201chold[] or \ndesire[].\u201d Id. And we know from preexisting usage that \nsuch \u201ccompensation\u201d includes benefits employees receive \nafter retirement. So when employers discriminate \u201cin \nregard to \u2026 compensation,\u201d they necessarily do so \n\u201cagainst a qualified individual.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12112(a). And as the \nnext section explains, it is proper for an employee (or \nformer employee) to sue whenever such a discriminatory \ncompensation policy affects them\u2014including when they \nreceive their benefits only after retiring. \nC. The when: The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act \nand Title I\u2019s enforcement provision taken \ntogether mean that retirees can sue over post-\nemployment benefits. \nIt is clear, then, that retirees are among the \u201cany \nperson[s]\u201d \u201cclaiming to be aggrieved\u201d who can invoke \nTitle I\u2019s enforcement mechanism. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5. So \ntoo is it clear that their retirement benefits are \n\u201ccompensation\u201d protected by the Act. Id. \u00a7 12112(a). The \nLilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, which Title I \nincorporates, brings Lt. Stanley\u2019s claim across the finish \nline: It allows retirees to bring suit when they are \n\u201caffected by application of\u201d discriminatory benefits plans \n\u201cadopted\u201d while they were working. Id. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A).  \n\n- 22 - \n \n1. Before the Fair Pay Act, those seeking to challenge \ndiscriminatory \npolicies \naffecting \npost-employment \nbenefits faced a challenge: Like Lt. Stanley, they may not \nhave learned about their discriminatory benefits policies \nuntil they were affected after retiring. That could be years \nafter the policies were adopted. Because such a claim \ncould have been characterized as merely seeking redress \nfor the \u201cadverse effects resulting from the past \ndiscrimination,\u201d it could well have been barred by the \nstatute of limitations. Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & \nRubber Co., 550 U.S. 618, 628 (2007). \nThe Fair Pay Act resolved this dilemma. It provides \nthat an unlawful employment practice occurs with respect \nto discrimination in compensation: \n[1] when a discriminatory compensation decision \nor other practice is adopted, [2] when an individual \nbecomes subject to a discriminatory compensation \ndecision or other practice, or [3] when an \nindividual is affected by application of a \ndiscriminatory compensation decision or other \npractice, including each time wages, benefits, or \nother compensation is paid, resulting in whole or \nin part from such a decision or other practice. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A). This provision applies to the \nADA through its incorporation of Title VII\u2019s enforcement \nmechanisms. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12117(a). \nThe Fair Pay Act thus makes clear that a claim under \nthe ADA is timely if the plaintiff sues when she \u201cbecomes \nsubject to\u201d or \u201cis affected by\u201d discrimination that occurred \nduring her tenure. This is true even if the plaintiff doesn\u2019t \nreceive the benefit in question until after her employment \nhas concluded. As a result, the Act permits a plaintiff to \nchallenge an employer\u2019s earlier decision to adopt a \n\n- 23 - \n \ndiscriminatory benefits policy when she is adversely \naffected, either by receiving a reduced benefit or by being \ndenied the benefit entirely. \nCrucially, the Fair Pay Act allows a plaintiff\u2019s claim to \naccrue or re-accrue even after the plaintiff\u2019s employment \nhas concluded. As long as the plaintiff \u201cbecomes subject \nto\u201d or \u201cis affected by application of\u201d the employer\u2019s earlier \ndiscriminatory decision after leaving her job, the \nemployer\u2019s liability will accrue or re-accrue then. 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A), (B). The Eleventh Circuit\u2019s view \nthat a former employee is no longer a \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d because she neither \u201cholds\u201d nor \u201cdesires\u201d a job \nhas no bearing on this analysis. 42 U.S.C. 12111(8). The \nFair Pay Act doesn\u2019t treat each discrete payment (or \nnonpayment) as a new discriminatory act that must \nindependently satisfy all of the ADA\u2019s elements. Rather, \nit allows a claim to accrue based on the past discriminatory \ndecision when the plaintiff is affected by that decision. \nThe Fair Pay Act eliminates any doubt about a \npotential mismatch between Congress\u2019s intent to broadly \nprohibit disability-based discrimination in retirement \nbenefits and the ADA\u2019s text. It ensures that plaintiffs can \ntimely enforce the settled rule that \u201cclassification of \nemployees on the basis of [disability] is no more \npermissible at the pay-out stage of a retirement plan than \nat the pay-in stage.\u201d Norris, 463 U.S. at 1081. And it \nreinforces what the ADA\u2019s text, structure, and purpose \nalready make clear: Former employees are protected \nfrom discrimination as to post-employment benefits.  \n2. When Lt. Stanley began her career as a firefighter, \nthe City promised to continue paying her health-insurance \nsubsidy until the age of 65 so long as she \u201cretire[d] with \ntwenty-five (25) years of service\u201d or \u201cretire[d] for \n\n- 24 - \n \ndisability reasons.\u201d Doc. 38-6 at 2; Pet. App. 21a. That \nretirement subsidy was, without a doubt, part of her \n\u201ccompensation\u201d and thus protected by Title I. 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 12112; see supra 19\u201321. Four years later, and while Lt. \nStanley was still working as a firefighter, the City changed \nits policy to distinguish between \u201cdisabled\u201d and \u201cnormal\u201d \nretirees. Doc. 1 at 12; see also Doc. 39-16 at 27\u201328. The \nlatter were still eligible for the full retirement benefit, but \nthe former would now receive only two years of the health \ncare subsidy (or less, if they qualified for Medicare \nbenefits). Pet. App. 22a. \nLt. Stanley was, of course, employed by the City in \n2003 when this \u201cdiscriminatory compensation decision\u201d \nthat she challenges was \u201cadopted.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-\n5(e)(3)(A). Thus, even if Lt. Stanley did need to hold or \ndesire a job when the City discriminated against her (but \nsee infra Part II), she did. The City \u201cadopted,\u201d id., its \npolicy in 2003 when Lt. Stanley indisputably was a \nqualified individual, and that policy discriminated \u201con the \nbasis of disability in regard to \u2026 employee compensation\u201d \n(her benefits), id. \u00a7 12112(a). Lt. Stanley\u2019s claim then re-\naccrued in 2020 when she was \u201caffected by application of\u201d \nthe policy (she was denied the health care subsidy). Id. \n\u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A). That means that she could bring this \nlawsuit exactly when she did to challenge exactly what she \nchallenged.   \nThe Eleventh Circuit rejected this reasoning by \nannouncing that Lt. Stanley \u201cconcedes, and we agree, that \nher claim cannot turn on the 2003 amendment to the \nbenefits plan because she was not yet disabled at that \ntime.\u201d App. 16. Nothing supports the assertion that Lt. \nStanley made that concession. To the contrary, Lt. \nStanley repeatedly argued the opposite, insisting that the \n\n- 25 - \n \nadoption \nof \nthe \npolicy \ndid \nconstitute \nunlawful \ndiscrimination against her. See, e.g., Doc. 1 at 4 \n(allegations in complaint addressing 2003 change); Op. Br. \nat viii\u2013ix (expressly adopting similar argument made in \nthe United States\u2019 amicus brief); Reply Br. at 6 (\u201cIn this \ncase, \nthe \nCity\u2019s \ndecision \nto \nenact \nthe \nfacially \ndiscriminatory 24-Month Rule in 2003 is the initial \n\u2018challenged employment decision.\u2019 \u2026 Thus, [Lt.] Stanley \nwas a \u2018Qualified Individual\u2019 able to perform her firefighter \nduties at the time of the \u2018challenged employment \ndecision.\u2019\u201d) (emphasis omitted); Oral Arg. 4:59\u20135:05 (\u201cAt \nthe time of the discriminatory act in 2003 she was a \nqualified individual.\u201d).  \nTo the extent the Eleventh Circuit held that the 2003 \npolicy change could not be actionable discrimination \nbecause Lt. Stanley \u201cwas not yet disabled at that time,\u201d it \nmisapplied the statute. App. 16. A person need not be \ndisabled to be subjected to unlawful discrimination under \nTitle I. The statute was specifically amended to avoid that \noutcome: It broadly prohibits discrimination \u201con the basis \nof disability\u201d rather than, as it had previously provided, \nonly against a qualified individual \u201cwith a disability.\u201d \nCompare 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a), with Pub. L. No. 101-336, \nTitle I, \u00a7 102, 104 Stat. 331 (1990). Here, the City acted \u201con \nthe basis of disability\u201d when it adopted a policy that, on its \nface, limits the amount of time that a person receives a \nsubsidy based on whether that person has a disability. See \nUAW v. Johnson Controls, Inc., 499 U.S. 187, 200 (1991) \n(\u201c[A]n explicit gender-based policy is sex discrimination \nunder\u201d Title VII).  \nIt is of no matter, then, that Lt. Stanley was not yet \ndisabled when the City changed its policy. Even if that was \n(somehow) relevant, it was inevitable that the facially \n\n- 26 - \n \ndiscriminatory policy would harm employees when they \nbecame disabled and had to retire before twenty-five \nyears of service. The Court may thus conceive of this claim \nas encompassing two moments of time that complete the \nwhole: when the facially discriminatory policy was \nadopted in 2003, and when Lt. Stanley became disabled. \nThis Court has recognized that certain Title VII claims \ncan encompass events occurring at different points in time \nas the basis for an action challenging a \u201csingle \ndiscriminatory act.\u201d Green v. Brennan, 578 U.S. 547, 562 \nn.7 (2016). By analogy, the same holds true here.  \nThe Fair Pay Act also demonstrates that the City \ndiscriminated against Lt. Stanley again when that same \ndiscriminatory policy was applied to her as she neared her \ninevitable early retirement. At that point, although she did \nnot yet feel the effects of the policy, Lt. Stanley became \n\u201csubject to\u201d it, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A); the policy \nconclusively determined what benefits she would receive \nonce her fast-approaching forced retirement began and, in \nthat way, removed her access to the more expansive \nbenefits package available to people without disabilities. \nSee Castellano v. City of New York, 142 F.3d 58, 68 (2d \nCir. 1998) (\u201c[A]n employee\u2019s entitlement to post-\nemployment fringe benefits arises \u2026 during his period of \nemployment.\u201d). That too is an \u201cunlawful employment \npractice\u201d \nthat \n\u201coccur[ed]\u201d \nduring \nLt. \nStanley\u2019s \nemployment. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A).1  \n \n1 The third way in which an unlawful employment practice \noccurs\u2014the individual becoming \u201caffected\u201d by the discriminatory \ndecision\u2014remains relevant here because it removes any doubt that \nLt. Stanley\u2019s claim is timely. She was \u201caffected\u201d when her subsidy \nended.  \n\n- 27 - \n \nThe Eleventh Circuit declined to address that alleged \ndiscrimination too, because Lt. Stanley \u201caffirmatively \nconceded\u201d that she was not \u201cimpacted by [the City\u2019s \npolicy] during her employment.\u201d App. 18. But that Lt. \nStanley was not yet \u201cimpacted\u201d (in terms of receiving a \ndecreased health care subsidy) in no way undermines her \nclaim. That\u2019s what the Fair Pay Act makes clear: A person \ncan be discriminated against when a \u201cdecision\u201d or \n\u201cpractice\u201d is \u201cadopted,\u201d or when they \u201cbecome[] subject \nto\u201d it, even if they are not \u201caffected by\u201d it until later. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A).  \nII. The ADA does not require a person to \u201chold[] or \ndesire[]\u201d a job to be a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d  \nThe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s holding was wrong for \nanother, independent reason: One does not need to \ncurrently \u201chold[] or desire\u201d a job to be a \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d under the ADA. The court below reached its \nholding by focusing on the definition of discrimination in \nsection 12112(a) and of \u201cqualified individual\u201d in section \n12111(8). Based on those provisions, it held that it is legal \nfor employers to discriminate against former employees \non the basis of disability.  \nNothing in the statute\u2019s text demands that surprising \nresult. The Eleventh Circuit\u2019s error is explained by its \nmisunderstanding \nof \nthe \ndefinition \nof \n\u201cqualified \nindividual.\u201d In the court\u2019s view, because section 12112(a) \nprohibits discrimination against \u201cqualified individuals\u201d \nand the definition of \u201cqualified individual\u201d speaks in the \npresent tense\u2014referring to a person who \u201ccan perform\u201d a \njob that the person \u201cholds\u201d or \u201cdesires\u201d\u2014the ADA \nprohibits discrimination only against a person while they \nhold (or are applying to) a job. App. 11.  \n\n- 28 - \n \nBut the court of appeals effectively rewrote the \nstatutory definition to impose two distinct requirements: \n\u201cQualified individual means an individual who (a) holds or \ndesires an employment position and (b) can perform the \nessential functions of that employment position.\u201d The text \nonly imposes one requirement: \u201c[Q]ualified individual \nmeans an individual who \u2026 can perform the essential \nfunctions of the employment position that such individual \nholds or desires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. 12111(8). The text asks only \none question\u2014what \u201ccan\u201d you do? \nThis understanding of the definition\u2019s text makes \nperfect sense given its role in the statute: It operates to \nafford employers cabined authority to act on the basis of \ndisability when doing so is necessary to preserve the \nfunctioning of the business. That is why the term is \ndefined with reference to \u201cessential functions,\u201d not \u201cany \nfunction.\u201d Its text is best read to impose only a conditional \nmandate, which tracks that role. If a person has (or seeks) \na job, that person must be able to perform its essential \nfunctions; if no such job exists\u2014because the person is \nretired\u2014the definition does not operate as a limit on the \nADA\u2019s prohibition on discrimination. In other words, the \ndefinition asks if you \u201ccan\u201d perform the functions of a job \nthat you hold or desire, not if you have or want one.  \nA. The text of section 12111(8) and its place in \nthe statutory scheme confirm that the \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition tests if you \ncan do a job, not if you have one.   \nThe definition of \u201cqualified individual\u201d exists to give \nemployers the cabined ability to act on the basis of job-\nrelated concerns so that they are not forced to hire or \nretain people who are incapable, even with the benefit of \nreasonable accommodations, of performing essential \n\n- 29 - \n \ntasks. We know that is the definition\u2019s role because of its \nplain text, its place in the statutory scheme, and its \nrelationship to other sections of the statute.  \n1. Text and purpose. \u201cStart with the text.\u201d Arellano v. \nMcDonough, 598 U.S. 1, 8 (2023). The definition asks if an \nindividual \u201ccan perform the essential functions of the \nemployment position that such individual holds or \ndesires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8) (emphasis added). It does \nnot ask if an individual \u201cholds or desires an employment \nposition whose essential functions she can perform.\u201d The \nlatter formulation would impose the \u201cmust hold or desire \na job\u201d requirement that the Eleventh Circuit perceived. \nThe former asks if you \u201ccan\u201d do a thing, not if you are \ndoing that thing or would do it.  \nThat the definition asks what an individual \u201ccan\u201d do \nmakes sense given its role in the statutory scheme. The \ndefinition gives employers necessary, but circumscribed, \nflexibility in light of the Act\u2019s sweeping impact. Title I \nprovides protection in all aspects of the employment \nrelationship. It broadly prohibits \u201cdiscriminat[ion]\u201d in \n\u201cjob application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or \ndischarge of employees, employee compensation, job \ntraining, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of \nemployment.\u201d \n42 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 12112(a). \nThat \ncovers \neverything from job applications to post-employment \nbenefits\u2014if something is \u201cpart and parcel of the \nemployment \nrelationship,\u201d \nan \nemployer \ncannot \n\u201cdiscriminate.\u201d Hishon, 467 U.S. at 75; supra at 19\u201321.  \nTitle I prohibits both \u201cdisparate treatment\u201d and \n\u201cdisparate impact.\u201d Raytheon Co. v. Hernandez, 540 U.S. \n44, 52 (2003). But it also goes further, \u201crequir[ing] \naffirmative \nconduct\u201d \nto \nensure \n\u201cthose \nwith \ndisabilities \u2026 obtain the same workplace opportunities \n\n- 30 - \n \nthat those without disabilities [] enjoy.\u201d Barnett, 535 U.S. \nat 397, 401; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A). Accordingly, the \nAct at times requires employers not to treat people with \ndisabilities \nequally, \nbut \ninstead \nto \ntreat \nthem \n\u201cpreferentially.\u201d \nBarnett, \n535 U.S. \nat \n397. \nThat \naffirmative mandate is reflected in the Act\u2019s definition of \ndiscrimination, which \u201cincludes \u2026 not making reasonable \naccommodations to the known physical or mental \nlimitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a \ndisability who is an applicant or employee.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A).  \nBecause of the Act\u2019s \u201cbold ambitions\u201d and \u201cfar-\nreaching\u201d scope, though, Congress recognized the need \nfor delineated \u201climits.\u201d Kincaid v. Williams, 143 S. Ct. \n2414, 2415\u201316 (2023) (Alito, J., dissenting from the denial \nof certiorari). As this Court has held, the ADA achieves its \nimportant \u201cobjectives\u201d within \u201cthe realm of the \nreasonable.\u201d Barnett, 535 U.S. at 401. Without some \nqualification, the statute would prevent employers from \ndenying employment to people whose disabilities, no \nmatter the steps taken to accommodate them, prevent \nthem from performing their jobs. A swimming pool could \nface liability for refusing to hire as a lifeguard a person \nwhose disability left her unable to swim. Congress, \nunsurprisingly, did not want to prohibit that sort of \nrational, and necessary, decision-making.  \nThe \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition ensures that \nemployers have the necessary leeway. The only people \nwho employers must hire, retain, and accommodate are \nthose who, \u201cwith or without\u201d accommodations, \u201ccan \nperform the essential functions of the employment \nposition.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8). The definition, then, exists \nto allow employers to screen out people who can\u2019t perform \n\n- 31 - \n \nthe core, or \u201cessential,\u201d functions of the job at issue. What \nit does not do, however, is grant employers a license to \nimplement \ndiscriminatory \nemployment \npolicies \nor \nindividual employment actions that have nothing to do \nwith an individual\u2019s ability to do a relevant job.  \n2. Statutory scheme. This understanding of the \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition\u2014as a screen that \nprevents employers from being obligated to hire and \naccommodate those who can\u2019t perform a job\u2014neatly \naligns with the rest of the statutory scheme that Congress \ndevised. Several provisions of the Act allow employers to \ntake actions that are justified in relation to the operation \nof their business. None of them invite employers to take \ndiscriminatory actions that have nothing to do with \nlegitimate business needs.  \nFor example, even when employers must provide \naccommodations, they need only be \u201creasonable,\u201d and \neven those they can forego if they \u201ccan demonstrate that \nthe accommodation would impose an undue hardship\u201d on \ntheir \u201coperation.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A). \u201c[Q]ualification \nstandards\u201d that screen out people with disabilities are \nimpermissible, unless that standard \u201cis shown to be job-\nrelated for the position in question and is consistent with \nbusiness necessity.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12112(b)(6). Other examples are \nsprinkled across the statute. See, e.g., id. \u00a7 12112(b)(7) \n(making it unlawful to administer \u201ctests concerning \nemployment\u201d unless those tests measure a person\u2019s \naptitude and skills rather than merely reflecting any \nimpairments); \nid. \n\u00a7 \n12112(d)(2) \n(prohibiting \npre-\nemployment \nmedical \nexaminations \nbut \npermitting \n\u201cinquiries into the ability of an applicant to perform job-\nrelated functions\u201d).  \n\n- 32 - \n \nEach of these provisions reflects a balance struck in \nthe Act: Discrimination is prohibited\u2014from application \nthrough retirement\u2014but employers have leeway to act on \nthe basis of disability where a sufficiently weighty and \nlegitimate business need calls for it. The \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d definition does just that\u2014nothing more, \nnothing less. It is not concerned with whether you have a \njob; it is concerned with employers\u2019 needs in relation to \ntheir current and future employees. Reading it to allow \ndiscrimination against former employees, by contrast \nmakes it do work in the statute that it simply is not doing. \n3. Surplusage. The court of appeals\u2019 reading also turns \nkey provisions of the Act into surplusage. It is a \u201c\u2018cardinal \nprincipal\u2019 of interpretation that courts must give effect, if \npossible, to every clause and word of a statute.\u201d Parker \nDrilling Mgmt. Servs., Ltd. v. Newton, 587 U.S. 601, 602 \n(2019). Accordingly, the canon against surplusage \ninstructs that a statute should be construed \u201cso that no \npart will be inoperative or superfluous, void or \ninsignificant.\u201d Rubin v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 583 U.S. \n202, 213 (2018). \nThe ADA\u2019s definition of discrimination, section \n12112(b)(5)(A), states that discrimination \u201cincludes \u2026 not \nmaking reasonable accommodations to the known physical \nor mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual \nwith a disability who is an applicant or employee.\u201d 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A) (emphasis added).  \nThis language tells us that the Act contemplates the \nexistence of some qualified individuals who are neither \n\u201capplicant[s] [n]or employee[s].\u201d If the court of appeals \nwas right that the qualified individual definition already \nscreens out individuals who do not \u201chold[] or desire[]\u201d a \njob, then this modifier\u2014\u201cwho is an applicant or employee\u201d \n\n- 33 - \n \n\u2014would be surplusage. And an interpretation that \n\u201ctreat[s]\u201d those \u201cstatutory terms as surplusage,\u201d \nparticularly when they\u2019re found in such a \u201cpivotal [] place \nin the statutory scheme\u201d (the reasonable-accommodation \nprovision), should give us pause. Duncan v. Walker, \n533 U.S. 167, 174 (2001). \u201cThe canon against surplusage is \nstrongest \nwhen \nan \ninterpretation \nwould \nrender \nsuperfluous another part of the same statutory scheme.\u201d \nCity of Chicago v. Fulton, 592 U.S. 154, 159 (2021).   \nThat there are \u201cqualified individual[s]\u201d not covered by \nsection 12112\u2019s reasonable-accommodation mandate is \nconfirmed by the other way its reach is narrowed. \nEmployers need only make reasonable accommodations \nfor \u201cqualified individual[s] with a disability.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A) (emphasis added). To be a \u201cqualified \nindividual,\u201d though, you need not have a disability. The \nADA was specifically amended to extend the \u201cgeneral\u201d \nantidiscrimination mandate not only to discrimination \nagainst persons \u201cwith a disability,\u201d but to more broadly \nreach discrimination \u201con the basis of disability.\u201d Compare \nPub. L. No. 101-336, Title I, \u00a7 102, 104 Stat. 331 (1990), \nwith 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a). Because there are \u201cqualified \nindividual[s]\u201d who are not disabled, as well as those who \nno longer hold or desire a job, then, the reasonable-\naccommodation provision makes perfect sense. That \nsection recognizes the breadth of who can be a \u201cqualified \nindividual,\u201d and then subtracts from its mandate the need \nto accommodate any \u201cqualified individual\u201d who is not a \nperson \u201cwith a disability\u201d and who is not \u201can applicant or \nemployee,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A)\u2014because only \ndisabled individuals engaged in (or seeking) active \nemployment actually need \u201caccommodations.\u201d   \n\n- 34 - \n \nSection 12112 thus demonstrates that, when Congress \nintended to limit the reach of a substantive protection to \napplicants and employees, it did so explicitly. \nB. Common usage, grammar, and logic all \ndemonstrate that the text does not compel \nreading \u201cqualified individual\u201d to exclude \nretirees. \nNothing in the text of the definition of \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d demands reading it to require that an \nindividual currently hold or desire a job. The Eleventh \nCircuit concluded otherwise, reasoning that, because of \nthe definition, the \u201cplain language\u201d of the anti-\ndiscrimination rule \u201cexpressly applie[s] only to \u2018qualified \nindividuals with a disability\u2019 who \u2018hold[]\u2019 or \u2018desire[]\u2019 an \n\u2018employment position.\u2019\u201d App. 7. But that reading seemed \nplain only because the court of appeals misunderstood a \nkey part of the definition: \nThe \nterm \n\u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d \nmeans \nan \nindividual who, with or without reasonable \naccommodation, \ncan \nperform \nthe \nessential \nfunctions of the employment position that such \nindividual holds or desires. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8) (emphasis added). It is the \u201ccan \nperform\u201d clause that makes the definition carry out its \nimportant role in the statute. See supra 29\u201331. That\u2019s how \nit tests an employee\u2019s capabilities. And retirees are not \nunable to pass this test\u2014that is, they\u2019re not unable to \nperform the essential functions of a job that they hold or \ndesire. \nTo be sure, testing the job capabilities of someone who \nis no longer working may seem logically awkward. But \nthat doesn\u2019t mean that retirees fail the test; it instead \n\n- 35 - \n \nhighlights the conditional nature of the requirement. And, \nas we explain below, common sense, common usage, and \nlogic all suggest that the best reading (or at least an \nequally plausible one) is that retirees are \u201cqualified \nindividuals.\u201d But even if one thought that the test was \nambiguous when applied to retirees, that still would \nrequire rejecting the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s reading, which is \n\u201c[in]consistent with the broader context\u201d of Title I \u201cand \nthe primary purpose of\u201d the \u201cqualified individual\u201d \ndefinition. Robinson, 519 U.S. at 849; see id. (holding that \n\u201cthe term \u2018employees,\u2019 as used in \u00a7 704(a) of Title VII\u201d \ncovers \u201cformer employees\u201d despite the text being \n\u201cambiguous\u201d because that reading is \u201cmore consistent \nwith the broader context of Title VII and the primary \npurpose of \u00a7 704(a)\u201d). \n1. Common usage. Title I defines a \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d as \u201can individual who, with or without \nreasonable accommodation, can perform the essential \nfunctions of the employment position that such individual \nholds or desires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8). The Eleventh \nCircuit mistakenly read that definition to require that an \nindividual currently hold or desire a job. But that is not \nthe only (or best) way to read the definition. A few parallel \nexamples demonstrate how an ordinary reader interprets \na sentence like this one.  \n\u201cYou can\u2019t watch the movie unless you silence your cell \nphone.\u201d If you come to the theater without a phone, do you \nviolate this rule? Surely no. That\u2019s because this rule \nrequires that patrons turn off their phones only to the \nextent that they have phones to turn off. For the same \nreason, a person without a phone can attend court despite \na rule that says \u201c[y]ou must turn off your cell phone before \n\n- 36 - \n \nentering the courtroom.\u201d2 The rules\u2014and their respective \npurposes\u2014are satisfied. \u201c[C]ommon sense,\u201d Pereira v. \nSessions, 585 U.S. 198, 211 (2018), tells us how to read \nthese rules. See Bond v. United States, 572 U.S. 844, 857 \n(2014) (\u201cThe notion that some things \u2018go without saying\u2019 \napplies to legislation just as it does to everyday life.\u201d). \nConsider another example. NASA gives an award each \nyear to the \u201camateur astronomer\u201d who \u201cdiscovered the \nintrinsically brightest near-Earth asteroid\u201d in the \nprevious year. 51 U.S.C. \u00a7 30902(c)(3)(A). As defined by \nthe statute, \u201camateur astronomer means an individual \nwhose employer does not provide any funding, payment, \nor compensation to the individual for the observation of \nasteroids and other celestial bodies.\u201d Id. \u00a7 30902(b)(1). Is \nan unemployed person with a home telescope eligible to \nwin that prize? Of course. What this rule obviously means \nin context is that, if you have an employer and if that \nemployer pays for your stargazing, you can\u2019t be an \n\u201camateur astronomer.\u201d Unemployed people don\u2019t fail that \ntest; they easily pass it.  \nOr try this one: \u201cA passenger may not board an \naircraft unless it is determined that the passenger is a \n\u2018cleared individual.\u2019\u201d \u201cA \u2018cleared individual\u2019 means an \nindividual who can successfully complete an x-ray \nscreening of the baggage that such individual carries or \nchecks.\u201d Does this hypothetical rule prohibit passengers \nwith no bags from boarding a plane? Obviously not. This \nrule doesn\u2019t require that a passenger have a carry-on or \nchecked bag; it requires the screening of any bag to the \nextent that a passenger has such luggage.  \n \n2 Thomas F. Eagleton U.S. Courthouse Self-Guided Tour, \nhttps://perma.cc/2BVB-2K4P. \n\n- 37 - \n \nIndeed, an actual TSA regulation provides that \u201c[n]o \nindividual may \u2026 board an aircraft without submitting to \nthe screening and inspection of\u201d her \u201caccessible \nproperty[.]\u201d 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1540.107(a). This regulation \nobviously doesn\u2019t require that a passenger carry any \n\u201caccessible property,\u201d only that she submit to the \nscreening of that property to the extent she has any.  \nAnother federal statute requires the government to \npay individuals for the \u201ccost of a comparable replacement \ndwelling\u201d when a federal project displaces them. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4623(a)(1)(A). Whether something qualifies as \na \n\u201ccomparable \nreplacement \ndwelling\u201d \nrequires \nconsidering how far away it is from the displaced person\u2019s \noriginal home \u201cwith respect to public utilities, facilities, \nservices, and \nthe \ndisplaced \nperson\u2019s \nplace \nof \nemployment.\u201d Id. \u00a7 4601(10) (emphasis added). The lack \nof a \u201cplace of employment\u201d can\u2019t possibly bar retirees \nfrom financial support.  \nNotably, Title II of the ADA has a similar textual \nfeature. That section forbids discrimination in public \n\u201cservices, programs, or activities.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132. Like \nTitle I, it makes use of \u201cqualified individual\u201d language: \n\u201c[N]o qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason \nof such disability, be excluded from participation in or be \ndenied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities \nof a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any \nsuch entity.\u201d Id. And its definition of \u201cqualified individual\u201d \nhas a similar structure to Title I\u2019s: \u201c[Q]ualified individual \nwith a disability means an individual with a disability who, \nwith or without reasonable modifications to rules, policies, \nor \npractices \u2026 meets \nthe \nessential \neligibility \nrequirements for the receipt of services or the \n\n- 38 - \n \nparticipation in programs or activities provided by a public \nentity.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12131(2) (emphasis added). \nNow consider a \u201crecreational\u201d program covered by the \nAct, United States v. Georgia, 546 U.S. 151, 157 (2006) \n(discussing \ndefinition \nof \n\u201cservices, \nprograms, \nor \nactivities\u201d), like the Washington & Old Dominion trail, \nwhich has no \u201cessential eligibility requirements\u201d for \n\u201cparticipation,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12131(2). The trail is open to \neveryone free of charge. Except that it has one rule: \u201cNo \npeople in wheelchairs.\u201d That blatant exclusion certainly \nviolates Title II. The fact that the trail has no \u201cessential \neligibility requirements\u201d does not mean the excluded \nperson with a disability ceases to be a \u201cqualified \nindividual.\u201d Instead, Title II is naturally read to say that, \nto \nthe \nextent \nthere \nare \n\u201cessential \neligibility \nrequirements,\u201d an individual must meet them. \nAlthough rules written this way can sometimes read \nawkwardly when their implicit condition fails, courts \nroutinely figure out how to interpret them. Take the \nfederal \ncompassionate-release \nstatute. \nThat \nlaw \nauthorizes a court to \u201cmodify a term of imprisonment\u201d \nwhen, among other things, the \u201creduction is consistent \nwith applicable policy statements issued by the \nSentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(A). In \nthe period after Congress passed the First Step Act, but \nbefore the Sentencing Commission revised its policy \nstatement, \nthe \n\u201coverwhelming \nmajority \nof \ncircuits \u2026 agreed that\u201d the only potentially relevant \npolicy statement was not \u201capplicable.\u201d 3 Charles Alan \nWright & Arthur R. Miller, Fed. Prac. & Proc. Crim. \n\u00a7 638.2 (5th ed. 2024). But courts didn\u2019t get hung up on \nwhether modifying a term of imprisonment was or wasn\u2019t \n\u201cconsistent\u201d \nwith \na \nnon-existent \nset \nof \n\u201cpolicy \n\n- 39 - \n \nstatements.\u201d Instead, they (sensibly) read the text to \nmean that a sentence reduction must be consistent with \nthe applicable policy statements to the extent there are \nany. Id. at nn. 23\u201324 (explaining that eight of nine circuits \nwho considered the question took this view, with the \nEleventh Circuit as the lone \u201coutlier\u201d). \nAs the compassionate-release cases demonstrate, \n\u201ccourts can \u2026 find implied conditionality as a function of \na statute\u2019s syntax\u201d and \u201cthe nature of written language.\u201d \nEric S. Fish, Severability As Conditionality, 64 Emory \nL.J. 1293, 1337\u201339 (2015); Michael McCarthy & Ronald \nCarter, \nCambridge \nGrammar \nof \nEnglish: \nA \nComprehensive Guide 755\u201356 (2006) (explaining that \n\u201c[c]onditions can be conveyed without any overt \nconditional subordinator\u201d and that \u201cconditions can be \nexpressed\u201d with \u201cthe omission of conjunctions such as if\u201d); \nsee, e.g., Boesche v. Udall, 373 U.S. 472, 479 (1963) (in a \ncase where there was \u201cno lease to cancel,\u201d declining to \nread a provision on lease cancellation\u2014which \u201csp[oke] \nentirely in terms of post-lease occurrences\u201d and \n\u201cassume[d] the existence of a valid lease\u201d\u2014to render the \nAct as a whole \u201cself-defeating\u201d).3 \nIn each example above, the rule presumes that some \npredicate condition exists (you have an employer, luggage, \n \n3 The proposition that some sentences are implicitly conditional is \nunextraordinary. \u201cWhen a command is conditional, its condition may \nbe either overt or explicit on the one hand (\u2018When it rains, close the \nwindows!!\u2019) or tacit or implicit on the other (\u2018Drive carefully!\u2019 [means] \n\u2018When you drive, drive carefully!!\u2019).\u201d Nicholas Rescher, The Logic of \nCommands 24 (1966); see also Chi-H\u00e9 Elder, Context, Cognition, and \nConditionals 2 (2019) (\u201c[W]hile conditional sentences in English are \noften associated with the canonical form \u2018if p, q,\u2019 we also know that \nneither the use of \u2018if\u2019 nor a two-clause structure is essential for \nexpressing a conditional thought.\u201d). \n\n- 40 - \n \nor a phone; the program has eligibility requirements), and \nyour compliance with the rule is determined in relation to \nthat predicate. But as each example makes clear, the \nabsence of the thing presumed doesn\u2019t mean that you \nnecessarily violate the rule. Instead, it will often mean (as \nit does in each one of those examples) that the rule is \neffectively satisfied or that its requirement controls only \nto the extent that the predicate condition actually exists.  \nThe \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition in Title I can \neasily be read like each of those examples. The rule tests \nwhether an individual is sufficiently qualified for a job. See \nsupra 29\u201331. Where there is no job and there are no \n\u201cessential functions,\u201d the test is satisfied. And because its \napplication to retirees has no relationship to its textual \nfunction in the statute, common sense says it should not \nbe applied to bar claims by retirees who no longer \n\u201chold[]or desire[]\u201d an \u201cemployment position.\u201d See Biden v. \nNebraska, 143 S. Ct. 2355, 2379 (2023) (Barrett, J., \nconcurring) (\u201cContext also includes common sense.\u201d); The \nFederalist No. 83, at 559 (Alexander Hamilton) (\u201cThe \nrules of legal interpretation are rules of common sense.\u201d). \n2. Grammar. The grammatical structure of the \ndefinition\u2014and the role of the \u201cholds or desires\u201d clause in \nthe sentence in particular\u2014further demonstrates that the \ntext does not compel the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s reading. \nBecause \u201c[w]ords are to be given the meaning that proper \ngrammar and usage would assign them,\u201d Antonin Scalia & \nBryan A. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of \nLegal Texts 140 (2012), the \u201crules of grammar govern\u201d \nstatutory \ninterpretation \n\u201cunless \nthey \ncontradict \nlegislative intent or purpose,\u201d id. (citing Costello v. INS, \n376 U.S. 120, 122\u2013126 (1964)). \n\n- 41 - \n \nConsider this rule at an apartment complex: \u201cYou \nmust clean up after the pets that you own.\u201d Here, \u201cthat \nyou own\u201d tells us which pets we\u2019re talking about: the ones \nyou own, if you own any. It doesn\u2019t mean that you must \nown a pet, or that all pets are owned by you, or that you \nhave to clean up after other people\u2019s pets. The rule is \ntelling us that, if you own a pet, you\u2019ve got to clean up after \nit. Similarly, in the ADA\u2019s definition, the clause \u201cthat such \nindividual holds or desires\u201d modifies \u201cemployment \nposition.\u201d See Barnhart v. Thomas, 540 U.S. 20, 26 (2003) \n(\u201c[A] limiting clause or phrase \u2026 should ordinarily be \nread as modifying only the noun or phrase that it \nimmediately follows.\u201d). It is introduced by the pronoun \n\u201cthat,\u201d which sets up what grammarians call a \u201crestrictive \nclause.\u201d Bryan A. Garner, Modern English Usage 1086\u2013\n87 (5th ed. 2022). This clause simply tells us which \nposition\u2019s functions matter, see id.\u2014here, \u201cthe essential \nfunctions of the employment position that such individual \nholds or desires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8) (emphasis added). \nThe restrictive clause thus does not create a \nfreestanding temporal requirement that an individual \nmust currently hold a job. See Heredia v. Sessions, 865 \nF.3d 60, 69 (2d Cir. 2017) (explaining that \u201ca restrictive \nclause\u201d that modifies a noun in an immigration statute \n\u201cdoes not impose a separate temporal requirement\u201d). \nRather, \nit \nspecifies \nwhich \njob\u2019s \nfunctions \nare \nrelevant if the individual either holds or desires a job.  \nThe court of appeals, however, misread this clause. It \ntreated \u201cholds or desires\u201d as though it imposed a separate \nrequirement, rather than simply identifying the relevant \njob. This misreading assumes that a clause doing one thing \n(specifying which job matters) is instead doing something \nelse entirely (requiring current or future employment). \n\n- 42 - \n \nThe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s emphasis on the present tense-\nverbs thus reflects a basic misunderstanding of the \nrestrictive clause\u2019s grammatical function.  \n \n3. Logic. Reading the \u201cqualified individual\u201d \ndefinition to include retirees like Lt. Stanley not only \nreflects common sense and common usage but is also \nsound as a matter of basic logic: Lt. Stanley satisfies the \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition because she is not unable \nto perform the essential functions of any job that she \ncurrently holds or desires. The definition doesn\u2019t require \nher to be able to perform her former job; it only asks about \nher ability to perform the functions of a job that she now \n\u201cholds or desires,\u201d which is none.  \nThis simple conclusion\u2014that can perform is logically \nequivalent to not unable to perform\u2014follows from a basic \nprinciple of \u201cclassical logic.\u201d Bethel v. Jefferson, 589 F.2d \n631, 639 n.49 (D.C. Cir. 1978) (reasoning that a plaintiff \nwho wasn\u2019t in a \u201cunit\u201d of government \u201cin the competitive \nservice\u201d necessarily fell under a Title VII provision \ngoverning everyone else). It \u201cholds simply that every \nalternation of a sentence with its negation is true.\u201d Id. \n(quoting Willard Van Orman Quine, Philosophy of Logic \n15, 83\u201387 (1970)).4 \n \n4 This law of double negation comes from the \u201claw of the excluded \nmiddle,\u201d one of Aristotle\u2019s three laws of thought. Irving Copi, \nIntroduction to Logic 372\u201373 (1994). An explanation goes like this: \u201cIf \nyou have a proposition P, either P is true, or P is false; that is, either \nP is true or non-P is true. We cannot have a third possibility. As a \nconsequence of the excluded middle, we have the principle of double \nnegation: Negation of negation is equivalent to affirmation.\u201d Alain \nBadiou, The Three Negations, 29 Cardozo L. Rev. 1877, 1878 (2008).  \n\n- 43 - \n \nC. Reading \u201cqualified individual\u201d in context to \ninclude retirees is consistent with the \nstatutory scheme and avoids creating \nsurplusage and absurd consequences.  \nAs everything above demonstrates, the court of \nappeals\u2019 reading of the \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition is \ncertainly not compelled by the text. But reading the \ndefinition to include retirees isn\u2019t necessarily compelled \nby the text alone, either. The only way to answer the \nquestion is with some context. Indeed, \u201cinterpretation \nalways depends on context.\u201d Scalia & Garner, Reading \nLaw at 63; see Graham Cnty. Soil & Water Conservation \nDist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson, 545 U.S. 409, 415 \n(2005) (\u201cStatutory language has meaning only in \ncontext.\u201d). Ours is the only reading that makes sense of \nthe statutory scheme as a whole.  \n1. The text must be read in context, not in isolation. \nWe concede that some implicitly conditional rules that \nread like the \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition might be \nnaturally read in context as excluding those who can\u2019t \nsatisfy the condition. Others, however, go the other way. \nConsider these two airport security rules: \n(A) \u201cTo get through security, a passenger must \ncomplete an x-ray screening of the baggage that \nsuch individual carries.\u201d Can you get through with \nno bags? \n(B) \u201cTo get through security, a passenger must scan \nthe boarding pass that such individual carries.\u201d Can \nyou get through with no boarding pass?  \nThe syntax is the same. But our inclination is probably \nto say yes to the first question, and no to the second. If you \ndon\u2019t have a boarding pass, you likely won\u2019t get through. \n\n- 44 - \n \nYet we somehow know that the person without bags is in \nthe clear. A gadfly passenger might point out that rule (B) \nliterally only requires scanning a pass \u201cthat such \nindividual carries.\u201d That hyperliteralism likely won\u2019t \npersuade the security officers. But he\u2019d have a point\u2014 the \nrule surely could have been written more clearly to \nexpress that you must have a boarding pass: \u201cNo \nindividual may go through security without a boarding \npass.\u201d \nAs with the airport rules, Congress could have written \nthe \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition to more obviously \ninclude, or exclude, retirees. You might think that \nCongress could have clarified that retirees are covered by \nusing the word \u201cany.\u201d But referring to \u201cany employment \nposition that such individual \u2026 desires\u201d would have been \nawkward and confusing. The point of the restrictive clause \nis to tell us which position a job seeker must qualify for (a \nparticular position), not to suggest any position she might \nwant. So \u201cwe can see why a Congress,\u201d with our reading \nin mind, \u201cmight have chosen\u201d against \u201cany,\u201d despite its \nsurface appeal. Pulsifer, 601 U.S. at 138. The indefinite \narticle \u201can\u201d might have been clearer; but it too would have \ncarried a similar risk of confusion, which may explain why \nthe drafters used \u201cthe.\u201d (They were focused on tying \nqualifications to \u201cthe\u201d position at issue.)  \nEven if Congress had used \u201cany\u201d or \u201can,\u201d though, the \nCity would presumably still be here with the same \narguments. So it\u2019s not clear that even this would have \n\u201cdelivered us from interpretive controversy\u201d and ended \nthe \u201cgrammatical back-and-forth.\u201d Id. On the other hand, \nit would have been easy to clearly exclude retirees: \u201cA \nqualified individual means an individual who holds or \n\n- 45 - \n \ndesires an employment position and who can perform the \nessential functions of that position.\u201d  \nIn any event, conceding that Congress could have \ndrafted the definition more clearly to include retirees \ndoesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s not the right reading. See Gardner \nv. Collins, 27 U.S. 58, 86\u201387 (1829) (Story, J.) (holding that, \nalthough \u201cthe words \u2018if any there be\u2019 [were] omitted\u201d from \none version of the same statute, \u201cthe legislative intention \nin both acts was the same\u201d). This Court does not \u201cdemand \n(or in truth expect) that Congress draft in the most \ntranslucent way possible.\u201d Pulsifer, 601 U.S. at 137.   \u201cThe \nquestion, then, is not: Could Congress have indicated\u201d its \nintent to protect retirees \u201cin more crystalline fashion\u201d? \nTorres v. Lynch, 578 U.S. 452, 472\u201373 (2016). \u201cThe \nquestion is instead, and more simply: Is that the right and \nfair reading of the statute\u201d that Congress actually \nwrote? Id. at 473.   \nUltimately, there\u2019s no single \u201cgrammatical principle\u201d \nthat conclusively answers that question. Pulsifer, 601 U.S. \nat 137. Instead, what each of the examples shows is that \ndeciding whether a rule like this one includes or excludes \nretirees requires considering its \u201ccontent\u201d and \u201ccontext.\u201d \nId. at 138 n.5. \u201c[S]tated in the usual language of statutory \nconstruction, the answer [] lie[s] in considering the \n[definition\u2019s] text in its legal context.\u201d Id. at 141.  \n2. The statutory context makes clear that retirees \nare protected by the ADA.  \nReading the \u201ctext\u201d in \u201ccontext\u201d is how we know that \nretirees are \u201cqualified individual[s].\u201d Id. The definition\u2019s \ntext asks if you \u201ccan\u201d do a job. It asks that question \nbecause the provision\u2019s role is to screen out from the Act\u2019s \nprotections those who can\u2019t perform essential functions of \na job, and whose inclusion would therefore impede the \n\n- 46 - \n \nemployer\u2019s legitimate business prerogatives. See supra \n29\u201331. There\u2019s no \u201cplausible, or even cogent, explanation\u201d \nfor why a definition with this function would exclude \nretirees, who are not asked to perform any essential \nfunctions at all. Pulsifer, 601 U.S. at 148 n.7; see Scalia & \nGarner, Reading Law at 20 (explaining that an \u201cessential \nelement of context that gives meaning to words\u201d is the \n\u201cevident purpose of what a text seeks to achieve\u201d).  \nInterpreting \nthe \ndefinition \nto \ninclude \nformer \nemployees also avoids creating \u201csuperfluity.\u201d Pulsifer, \n601 U.S. at 142. On the court of appeals\u2019 reading, there\u2019s \nno role for the language limiting the reasonable-\naccommodation mandate to a \u201cqualified individual \u2026 who \nis an applicant or employee.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A). \nBy contrast, interpreting \u201cqualified individual\u201d to include \nretirees means that there is no surplusage; this, too, is \nrelevant \u201clegal context.\u201d Pulsifer, 601 U.S. at 141. \nThere\u2019s more. Recognizing that the definition does not \nexclude retirees gives force to the various provisions of the \nAct that protect retirees: Its inclusion of retirement \nbenefits as part and parcel of \u201ccompensation,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 12112(a), and its express allowance for a particular kind \n(but not the kind alleged in this case) of decision-making, \n\u201cbased on underwriting risks, classifying risks, [and] \nadministering such risks,\u201d when \u201cestablishing\u201d or \n\u201cadministering\u201d \u201cbenefit[s] plans,\u201d id. \u00a7 12201(c)(2).  \nThis reading also maintains congruity between the \nADA and Title VII, the statute on which much of Title I \nwas \u201cmodeled.\u201d Barnett, 535 U.S. at 420 (Souter, J., \ndissenting). As this Court made clear in Robinson v. Shell \nOil Co., many of Title VII\u2019s protections apply with full \nforce to \u201cformer employees.\u201d 519 U.S. at 342.  \n\n- 47 - \n \nFinally, \ninterpreting \nthe \n\u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d \ndefinition to include retirees avoids the absurd results that \nthe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s interpretation invites. The court of \nappeals\u2019 view means that employers are free to do the day \nafter retirement what they certainly could not do the day \nbefore. An employer motivated by nothing but raw animus \ncould lawfully strip a former employee who becomes \ndisabled after retiring of their benefits\u2014benefits that the \nstatute protects and that were earned while \u201cperform[ing] \nthe essential functions of the employment position\u201d the \nretiree held. And they could do so while openly stating \nthat the decision was based solely on their preference for \n\u201cnormal\u201d retirees over \u201cdisabled\u201d ones. See Doc. 1 at 12.  \nAn interpretation that allows that result\u2014which the \nEleventh Circuit\u2019s does\u2014would \u201cnegate [the ADA\u2019s] own \nstated purposes.\u201d New York State Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs. v. \nDublino, 413 U.S. 405, 420 (1973). Had Congress made a \ndeliberate choice to adopt that surprising and dramatic \ndeparture from the design of Title VII, it\u2019s hard to believe \nthat it would have done so through the use of present-\ntense verbs in an ambiguous restrictive clause at the end \nof a definitional provision. See Whitman v. Am. Trucking \nAss\u2019ns, 531 U.S. 457, 468 (2001) (\u201cCongress \u2026 does not, \none might say, hide elephants in mouseholes.\u201d). \nThe \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition might, \u201cat first \nblush,\u201d then, allow the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s interpretation. \nRobinson, 519 U.S. at 341. But any confidence in that first \nimpression gives way on a closer look, and resort to the \nordinary tools of statutory construction\u2014text and \u201cthe \nbroader context of\u201d the ADA\u2014all lead to the same \nconclusion: The ADA does not allow employers to freely \ndiscriminate against their former employees.

This action will provide the respondent's counterarguments, which are critical for a balanced analysis. The brief will detail why the City believes the Eleventh Circuit's precedent is correct, how it interprets the text of the ADA, and how it distinguishes potentially unfavorable precedent like Robinson v. Shell Oil Co. This information will drastically reduce uncertainty about the legal landscape of the case and is fundamental to predicting the votes of individual justices and the overall outcome. Therefore, the Task EIG is very high. The Design EIG is moderate; while reading the respondent's brief is a standard and expected step in legal analysis, executing it successfully reinforces the importance of this core component in any robust prediction strategy.

That issue is whether discrimination \noccurring entirely post-employment against totally \ndisabled former employees, is actionable under Title I \nof the ADA. The Eleventh Circuit, joining the majority \nof courts, correctly held that Title I unambiguously \nprohibits discrimination solely against an individual \nwho \u201ccan perform\u201d the job she presently \u201cholds or \ndesires.\u201d Thus, it concluded that because Petitioner \ncould not establish that the City committed any \ndiscriminatory acts against her while she could \nperform the essential functions of a job that she held \nor desired to hold, her Title I claim failed. \nIn Part I of her brief, Petitioner raises an \nargument that she not only failed to press below, but \nthat she expressly disclaimed. She untimely argues \nshe \nwas \ndiscriminated \nagainst \nduring \nher \nemployment when she was a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d \nHowever, she conceded in her initial brief below that \nshe could not have brought these claims while she was \nstill employed and able to do her job because she would \nhave lacked standing. The Eleventh Circuit properly \ndeclined to decide her opposite position untimely \nraised for the first time in her reply brief.  \nThis Court \u201cdoes not \u2018[o]rdinarily...decide in the \nfirst instance issues not decided below.\u2019\u201d City of \nAustin, Texas v. Reagan Nat'l Advert. of Austin, LLC, \n596 U.S. 61, 76 (2022). Therefore, Petitioner\u2019s \ncontention that this Court \u201cneed not reach\u201d the circuit-\nsplit question and should reverse on the issue she \ndisclaimed, should be rejected. This Court should only \n\n2 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nconsider the circuit-split question. But to the extent \nthis Court reviews the question not pressed or passed \nupon, it should find that Petitioner\u2019s unpreserved \nclaims of discrimination during employment are \nunpled and time-barred. The Ledbetter Act has no \nplace here to save her waived claims allegedly \naccruing two decades ago.  \nPetitioner incorrectly claims that the Eleventh \nCircuit held that a disabled retired firefighter may be \nsubjected to discrimination with impunity. It said \nnothing of the sort. And \u201c[i]t seems more than \nuncharitable to say,\u201d Kincaid v. Williams, 143 S. Ct. \n2414, 2418 (2023) (Alito, J., dissenting), that the court \nof appeal\u2019s finding of an unambiguous limitation on \nTitle I\u2019s prohibitions is the same as finding that a \nretiree \u201cmay be subjected to discrimination with \nimpunity.\u201d  \nThe Eleventh Circuit also did not hold that former \nemployees can never sue under Title I regarding post-\nemployment benefits. It held that discrimination \noccurring during employment against a \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d is actionable under the ADA. And for \nalleged discrimination post-employment, there are \nnumerous remedies under other federal and state \nlaws. Thus, Petitioner\u2019s claims failed, not for lack of \nremedy or an incorrect interpretation of the ADA, but \nbecause of her allegations and litigation strategy. This \nCourt should affirm.  \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent statutory provisions are reproduced in \nthe appendix to this brief.  \n\n3 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Statutory Background \n1. In enacting the Americans with Disabilities \nAct, Congress found, in part, that \u201csociety has tended \nto isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(a)(2). Congress enacted Title I of the \nADA to provide legal remedies for discrimination \nagainst disabled workers that did not previously exist. \nSee 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(a)(4). At the time, several other \nfederal statutes existed for the protection of employee \nretirement benefits such as ERISA and the Social \nSecurity Act. The Equal Protection Clause provided an \nadditional remedy for public employees. See Tennessee \nv. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 522 (2004) (\u201cemphasiz[ing] that \nthe House and Senate Committee Reports on the ADA \nfocused on \u2018[d]iscrimination [in]...employment in the \nprivate sector,\u2019 and made no mention of discrimination \nin public employment.\u201d) (emphasis added by the \nCourt). \nThis Court has also \u201cidentified Title I\u2019s purpose as \nenforcement of the Fourteenth Amendment's [equal \nprotection] command that \u2018all persons similarly \nsituated should be treated alike.\u2019\u201d Id. Thus, except as \nto the ADA\u2019s requirement that employers provide \n\u201creasonable accommodations\u201d for the disabled, 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A), the essence of the ADA is \nequal\u2014not preferential\u2014treatment for the disabled. \nSee Williams v. United Ins. Co. of Am., 253 F.3d 280, \n282 (7th Cir. 2001) (an \u201cemployer is not required to \ngive the disabled employee preferential treatment.\u201d). \n\u201cThe ADA requires only that persons with disabilities \nhave the opportunity to receive the same benefits as \nnon-disabled officers who have given an equivalent \n\n4 \n\u0003\n\u0003\namount of service.\u201d Castellano v. City of New York, 142 \nF.3d 58, 70 (2d Cir. 1998). \n2. The ADA\u2019s prohibition against discrimination \nin employment is codified in Title I: \n(a) General rule. No covered entity shall \ndiscriminate \nagainst \na \nqualified \nindividual on the basis of disability in \nregard to job application procedures, \nthe hiring, advancement, or discharge \nof employees, employee compensation, \njob \ntraining, \nand \nother \nterms, \nconditions, \nand \nprivileges \nof \nemployment. \n \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a) (emphasis added). The term of art \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d is incorporated into the general \nrule and defines the class of individuals protected by \nits prohibition against discrimination: \n \nThe term \u201cqualified individual\u201d means an \nindividual \nwho, \nwith \nor \nwithout \nreasonable accommodation, can perform \nthe essential functions of the employment \nposition that such individual holds or \ndesires. \n \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8). \u201cThe determination of whether a \nperson is qualified should be made at the time of the \nemployment action, e.g. hiring or promotion...\u201d H.R. \nRep. No. 101\u2013485(III), at 34 (1990).  \n \n3. While Title I \u201cborrows much of its procedural \nframework from [T]itle VII,\u201d it \u201cborrows much of its \n\n5 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nsubstantive framework from Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973.\u201d Id. at 31. The \u201cconcept\u201d of \na \u201cqualified individual\u201d comes from \u201cthe regulations \nimplementing...the Rehabilitation Act\u201d\u2014not from \nTitle VII. Id. at 33; see also Alexander v. Choate, 469 \nU.S. 287, 309 (1985) (no unlawful discrimination \nfound under the Rehabilitation Act because the state's \npolicy was \u201cneutral on its face\u201d and it \u201cmade the same \nbenefit...equally accessible to both handicapped and \nnonhandicapped persons\u2026\u201d). \nB. Factual Background \n1. Because Petitioner argues that the Eleventh \nCircuit erred in affirming the dismissal of her ADA \nclaim at the pleading stage, the facts should be taken \nfrom her complaint only. Petitioner\u2019s statement of the \nfacts, however, largely draws from the evidence \ndeveloped at the summary judgment stage on her \nEqual Protection Clause claim. The pertinent factual \nallegations from her complaint are as follows.  \nPetitioner alleged that when she was hired in \n1999, the City \u201cpaid for health insurance for its \nemployees who retired after 25 years of service and its \nemployees who retired on account of disability\u201d until \n\u201cthe age of 65.\u201d Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 13, 19. In 2018, she accepted \na disability retirement because she was completely \nunable to perform her duties as a firefighter due to an \nunidentified \u201cphysical disability.\u201d Id. \u00b6 16. \nFifteen years before she retired, the City changed \nits policy in 2003 to require all retirees to complete 25 \nyears\u2019 service to earn the subsidy to age 65. See id. \u00b6\u00b6 \n19, 24. But the change still treated disability retirees \nbetter than similarly situated non-disabled retirees \n\n6 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nwith less than 25 years because while the latter \nreceived nothing, the former received the subsidy for \n24 months or until their receipt of Medicare benefits, \nwhichever came first. Id. \u00b6 24.  \nPetitioner, however, did not sue the City for \nbreach of an employment contract or bring an \nunconstitutional takings claim based on the change. \nThus, Petitioner\u2019s statement that the City \u201cpromised\u201d \nher the benefits under the defunct policy from 15 years \nbefore \nshe \nretired, \nis \nfactually \nand \nlegally \nunsupported. Pet. Br. 11. Petitioner only had a vested \nright to benefits under a policy \u201cin effect at the time\u201d \nof her retirement. City of Hollywood v. Bien, 209 So. \n3d 1, 3 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2016). \nWhile Petitioner claims the policy change was \nmade \u201cquietly,\u201d Pet. Br. 10, her complaint actually \nalleges a public announcement of the policy because it \nwas \u201ccodified in City Policy Section 2.45(c)\u201d of its \nordinances, and in its \u201cofficial personnel policies.\u201d Doc. \n1, \u00b6 24; see also Doc. 38-10 at 2-5; Doc. 38-11 at 4. Her \ncomplaint does not allege that she was unaware of the \npersonnel policy or the ordinance at the time of its \npassage or when she retired.  \nBecause she was totally disabled and unable to \nwork, Petitioner retired early with only 20 years\u2019 \nservice instead of the 25 required to earn the subsidy \nto age 65. Doc. 1, \u00b6 16. Her complaint did not allege \nwhen she became disabled or that she continued to \nwork thereafter as a \u201cqualified individual\u201d with a \ndisability before she retired. Petitioner only alleged \nthat because of a \u201cphysical disability\u201d she took a \ndisability retirement in November 2018 and as a \nresult, the City\u2019s subsidy policy would be applied to \n\n7 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nher, and she would lose the subsidy in November of \n2020\u201424 months after her retirement date. Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 \n16, 26.  \n2. Petitioner erroneously claims that the City\u2019s \nsubsidy \npolicy \ndistinguished \nbetween \n\u201cnormal \nretirees\u201d and disabled retirees. Pet. Br. 11.1 However, \nthe phrase \u201cnormal retiree\u201d appears nowhere in the \nordinance. See Doc. 38-10 at 2-5. Rather, the ordinance \nshows that any retiree, disabled or non-disabled, with \n25 years of service is eligible for the subsidy to age 65. \nDoc. 38-10 at 4, \u00b6 2.45(C), (G). The ordinance did not \ncondition the subsidy to age 65 on a \u201cnormal \nretirement\u201d because under the City\u2019s pension plan, a \n\u201cnormal retirement\u201d could be taken after only ten (10) \nyears of service. Doc. 39-17 at 27; J.A. 35, n. 2.  \nPetitioner, like everyone else, was eligible to \nreceive the full subsidy so long as she served 25 years. \nHowever, in 2018, she requested and was awarded a \n\u201cdisability retirement\u201d with only 20 years of service. \nDoc. 38-5.2 But even though she failed to fulfill the \nservice-based criteria, the City, out of compassion, \nprovided 24 months of the subsidy to its totally \ndisabled retirees who retired early short of 25 years. \nDoc. 38-10 at 4, \u00b6 2.45(C), (F), (G); J.A. 34-35, 40; Doc. \n38 at 21-22. Uncoincidentally, 24 months is exactly \nhow long it takes before a totally disabled retiree like \nPetitioner is eligible to receive Medicare benefits. See \nMedicare Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 426(b)(2)(A), 1395o(a)(1). \n\u0003\n1 Petitioner cites to Doc. 39-16 for this proposition but omits key \nlanguage from that document which shows that the policy was \nbased solely on years of service and not a \u201cnormal\u201d retirement.  \n2 Petitioner insinuates that she was disabled \u201cin the line of duty.\u201d \nPet. Br. 1, 11. The record shows she was not. Doc. 38-5. \n\n8 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nSimilarly situated, non-disabled retirees with only 20 \nyears\u2019 service received no subsidy at all and they are \nnot Medicare eligible because they are not disabled. \nDoc. 38-10 at 4, \u00b6 2.45(C); J.A. 34-35, 44. Thus, far \nfrom treating Petitioner worse because of her \ndisability than her non-disabled co-workers with the \nsame amount of service, she was treated better than \nthem because of her total disability.  \nAlthough the City would have liked to continue \npaying disability retirees with less than 25 years the \nsame subsidy as 25-year retirees, it was forced to cut \ncosts and start treating disability retirees the same as, \nrather than better than, everyone else with less than \n25 years of service. Doc. 38-10 at 2; J.A. 34 n. 1, 40. \nPrior to the 2003 ordinance, the City had the resources \nto pay the subsidy to age 65 for both 25-year retirees \nand \u201cdisability retirees\u201d with less than 25 years. \nHowever, the City was permitted to change that policy \nbefore Petitioner\u2019s rights vested at retirement. Florida \nSheriffs Ass'n v. Dep't of Admin., Div. of Ret., 408 So. \n2d 1033, 1036-37 (Fla. 1981). \nPetitioner claims (at 11) that the City\u2019s HR \nDirector could not explain why the City changed the \nsubsidy policy. He was deposed nearly twenty years \nafter the ordinance was passed and thus his \nknowledge of it was limited to what could be discerned \nfrom the public records. Doc. 39-4 at 1, 10, 80. The \ndistrict court found that the purpose was clearly set \nforth in the ordinance itself and the City articulated \nits legitimate reasons for its service-based policy to \nreward long-term employment, contain costs, and \nprovide compassion for employees who retire early due \nto disability. J.A. 34 n. 1, 40, 45. The City\u2019s policy \n\n9 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nprovided disabled employees access to the same \nbenefits available to all. Doc. 38-10 at 4, \u00b6 2.45(C).  \nC. Procedural Background \n1. The City moved to dismiss Petitioner\u2019s ADA \nclaim because she only alleged post-employment \ndiscrimination when she was no longer a \u201cqualified \nindividual.\u201d Doc. 14 at 4-5. Petitioner did not dispute \nthe City\u2019s characterization of her allegations or argue \nthat her complaint actually alleged discrimination \nduring her employment. See Doc. 17. Petitioner also \ndid not move for leave to amend to add allegations of \ndiscrimination during employment. \nTherefore, \nthe \ndistrict \ncourt \ndismissed \nPetitioner\u2019s ADA claim because she alleged the \n\u201cdiscrimination did not occur until Plaintiff was no \nlonger able to perform the essential functions of her \njob\u201d when she was no longer a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d \nPet. App. 26a. After dismissal, Petitioner did not move \nfor reconsideration arguing the court misapprehended \nany allegations of discrimination during employment.  \nOn her Equal Protection Clause Claim, the \ndistrict court found the policy drew \u201cneutral\u201d lines \nbased on service requiring all retirees to serve 25 \nyears to earn the subsidy to age 65. J.A. 44-45. \n2. Petitioner\u2019s initial brief in the Eleventh Circuit \nconfirmed that her complaint only alleged post-\nemployment discrimination because she argued she \n\u201ccould not have brought these claims while she was \nstill employed\u201d because \u201cshe would have lacked \nstanding.\u201d Pet. C.A. Br. 22. The Eleventh Circuit \ntherefore refused to pass upon this issue expressly \n\n10 \n\u0003\n\u0003\ndisclaimed \nin \nher \ninitial \nbrief \nand \nuntimely \ncontradicted in her reply brief. Pet. App. 17a.  \nNext, the Eleventh Circuit analyzed whether the \nCity\u2019s post-employment application of the subsidy \npolicy was, in its own right, a fresh violation of Title I, \nrather \nthan \nan \nalleged \nextension \nof \npast \ndiscrimination. Pet. App. 16a. In doing so, it found \nthat nothing in the Ledbetter Act \u201cchanges Title I\u2019s \nsubstantive requirements,\u201d including the requirement \nthat one be a \u201cqualified individual\u201d at the time of the \ndiscriminatory act. Pet. App. 15a. It held the \nLedbetter Act\u2019s \u201crelaxed statute of limitations helps a \nplaintiff only if that plaintiff otherwise has a claim for \ndiscrimination.\u201d Id.  \nTher\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

That issue is whether discrimination \noccurring entirely post-employment against totally \ndisabled former employees, is actionable under Title I \nof the ADA. The Eleventh Circuit, joining the majority \nof courts, correctly held that Title I unambiguously \nprohibits discrimination solely against an individual \nwho \u201ccan perform\u201d the job she presently \u201cholds or \ndesires.\u201d Thus, it concluded that because Petitioner \ncould not establish that the City committed any \ndiscriminatory acts against her while she could \nperform the essential functions of a job that she held \nor desired to hold, her Title I claim failed. \nIn Part I of her brief, Petitioner raises an \nargument that she not only failed to press below, but \nthat she expressly disclaimed. She untimely argues \nshe \nwas \ndiscriminated \nagainst \nduring \nher \nemployment when she was a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d \nHowever, she conceded in her initial brief below that \nshe could not have brought these claims while she was \nstill employed and able to do her job because she would \nhave lacked standing. The Eleventh Circuit properly \ndeclined to decide her opposite position untimely \nraised for the first time in her reply brief.  \nThis Court \u201cdoes not \u2018[o]rdinarily...decide in the \nfirst instance issues not decided below.\u2019\u201d City of \nAustin, Texas v. Reagan Nat'l Advert. of Austin, LLC, \n596 U.S. 61, 76 (2022). Therefore, Petitioner\u2019s \ncontention that this Court \u201cneed not reach\u201d the circuit-\nsplit question and should reverse on the issue she \ndisclaimed, should be rejected. This Court should only \n\n2 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nconsider the circuit-split question. But to the extent \nthis Court reviews the question not pressed or passed \nupon, it should find that Petitioner\u2019s unpreserved \nclaims of discrimination during employment are \nunpled and time-barred. The Ledbetter Act has no \nplace here to save her waived claims allegedly \naccruing two decades ago.  \nPetitioner incorrectly claims that the Eleventh \nCircuit held that a disabled retired firefighter may be \nsubjected to discrimination with impunity. It said \nnothing of the sort. And \u201c[i]t seems more than \nuncharitable to say,\u201d Kincaid v. Williams, 143 S. Ct. \n2414, 2418 (2023) (Alito, J., dissenting), that the court \nof appeal\u2019s finding of an unambiguous limitation on \nTitle I\u2019s prohibitions is the same as finding that a \nretiree \u201cmay be subjected to discrimination with \nimpunity.\u201d  \nThe Eleventh Circuit also did not hold that former \nemployees can never sue under Title I regarding post-\nemployment benefits. It held that discrimination \noccurring during employment against a \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d is actionable under the ADA. And for \nalleged discrimination post-employment, there are \nnumerous remedies under other federal and state \nlaws. Thus, Petitioner\u2019s claims failed, not for lack of \nremedy or an incorrect interpretation of the ADA, but \nbecause of her allegations and litigation strategy. This \nCourt should affirm.  \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent statutory provisions are reproduced in \nthe appendix to this brief.  \n\n3 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Statutory Background \n1. In enacting the Americans with Disabilities \nAct, Congress found, in part, that \u201csociety has tended \nto isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(a)(2). Congress enacted Title I of the \nADA to provide legal remedies for discrimination \nagainst disabled workers that did not previously exist. \nSee 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(a)(4). At the time, several other \nfederal statutes existed for the protection of employee \nretirement benefits such as ERISA and the Social \nSecurity Act. The Equal Protection Clause provided an \nadditional remedy for public employees. See Tennessee \nv. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 522 (2004) (\u201cemphasiz[ing] that \nthe House and Senate Committee Reports on the ADA \nfocused on \u2018[d]iscrimination [in]...employment in the \nprivate sector,\u2019 and made no mention of discrimination \nin public employment.\u201d) (emphasis added by the \nCourt). \nThis Court has also \u201cidentified Title I\u2019s purpose as \nenforcement of the Fourteenth Amendment's [equal \nprotection] command that \u2018all persons similarly \nsituated should be treated alike.\u2019\u201d Id. Thus, except as \nto the ADA\u2019s requirement that employers provide \n\u201creasonable accommodations\u201d for the disabled, 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A), the essence of the ADA is \nequal\u2014not preferential\u2014treatment for the disabled. \nSee Williams v. United Ins. Co. of Am., 253 F.3d 280, \n282 (7th Cir. 2001) (an \u201cemployer is not required to \ngive the disabled employee preferential treatment.\u201d). \n\u201cThe ADA requires only that persons with disabilities \nhave the opportunity to receive the same benefits as \nnon-disabled officers who have given an equivalent \n\n4 \n\u0003\n\u0003\namount of service.\u201d Castellano v. City of New York, 142 \nF.3d 58, 70 (2d Cir. 1998). \n2. The ADA\u2019s prohibition against discrimination \nin employment is codified in Title I: \n(a) General rule. No covered entity shall \ndiscriminate \nagainst \na \nqualified \nindividual on the basis of disability in \nregard to job application procedures, \nthe hiring, advancement, or discharge \nof employees, employee compensation, \njob \ntraining, \nand \nother \nterms, \nconditions, \nand \nprivileges \nof \nemployment. \n \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a) (emphasis added). The term of art \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d is incorporated into the general \nrule and defines the class of individuals protected by \nits prohibition against discrimination: \n \nThe term \u201cqualified individual\u201d means an \nindividual \nwho, \nwith \nor \nwithout \nreasonable accommodation, can perform \nthe essential functions of the employment \nposition that such individual holds or \ndesires. \n \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8). \u201cThe determination of whether a \nperson is qualified should be made at the time of the \nemployment action, e.g. hiring or promotion...\u201d H.R. \nRep. No. 101\u2013485(III), at 34 (1990).  \n \n3. While Title I \u201cborrows much of its procedural \nframework from [T]itle VII,\u201d it \u201cborrows much of its \n\n5 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nsubstantive framework from Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973.\u201d Id. at 31. The \u201cconcept\u201d of \na \u201cqualified individual\u201d comes from \u201cthe regulations \nimplementing...the Rehabilitation Act\u201d\u2014not from \nTitle VII. Id. at 33; see also Alexander v. Choate, 469 \nU.S. 287, 309 (1985) (no unlawful discrimination \nfound under the Rehabilitation Act because the state's \npolicy was \u201cneutral on its face\u201d and it \u201cmade the same \nbenefit...equally accessible to both handicapped and \nnonhandicapped persons\u2026\u201d). \nB. Factual Background \n1. Because Petitioner argues that the Eleventh \nCircuit erred in affirming the dismissal of her ADA \nclaim at the pleading stage, the facts should be taken \nfrom her complaint only. Petitioner\u2019s statement of the \nfacts, however, largely draws from the evidence \ndeveloped at the summary judgment stage on her \nEqual Protection Clause claim. The pertinent factual \nallegations from her complaint are as follows.  \nPetitioner alleged that when she was hired in \n1999, the City \u201cpaid for health insurance for its \nemployees who retired after 25 years of service and its \nemployees who retired on account of disability\u201d until \n\u201cthe age of 65.\u201d Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 13, 19. In 2018, she accepted \na disability retirement because she was completely \nunable to perform her duties as a firefighter due to an \nunidentified \u201cphysical disability.\u201d Id. \u00b6 16. \nFifteen years before she retired, the City changed \nits policy in 2003 to require all retirees to complete 25 \nyears\u2019 service to earn the subsidy to age 65. See id. \u00b6\u00b6 \n19, 24. But the change still treated disability retirees \nbetter than similarly situated non-disabled retirees \n\n6 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nwith less than 25 years because while the latter \nreceived nothing, the former received the subsidy for \n24 months or until their receipt of Medicare benefits, \nwhichever came first. Id. \u00b6 24.  \nPetitioner, however, did not sue the City for \nbreach of an employment contract or bring an \nunconstitutional takings claim based on the change. \nThus, Petitioner\u2019s statement that the City \u201cpromised\u201d \nher the benefits under the defunct policy from 15 years \nbefore \nshe \nretired, \nis \nfactually \nand \nlegally \nunsupported. Pet. Br. 11. Petitioner only had a vested \nright to benefits under a policy \u201cin effect at the time\u201d \nof her retirement. City of Hollywood v. Bien, 209 So. \n3d 1, 3 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2016). \nWhile Petitioner claims the policy change was \nmade \u201cquietly,\u201d Pet. Br. 10, her complaint actually \nalleges a public announcement of the policy because it \nwas \u201ccodified in City Policy Section 2.45(c)\u201d of its \nordinances, and in its \u201cofficial personnel policies.\u201d Doc. \n1, \u00b6 24; see also Doc. 38-10 at 2-5; Doc. 38-11 at 4. Her \ncomplaint does not allege that she was unaware of the \npersonnel policy or the ordinance at the time of its \npassage or when she retired.  \nBecause she was totally disabled and unable to \nwork, Petitioner retired early with only 20 years\u2019 \nservice instead of the 25 required to earn the subsidy \nto age 65. Doc. 1, \u00b6 16. Her complaint did not allege \nwhen she became disabled or that she continued to \nwork thereafter as a \u201cqualified individual\u201d with a \ndisability before she retired. Petitioner only alleged \nthat because of a \u201cphysical disability\u201d she took a \ndisability retirement in November 2018 and as a \nresult, the City\u2019s subsidy policy would be applied to \n\n7 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nher, and she would lose the subsidy in November of \n2020\u201424 months after her retirement date. Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 \n16, 26.  \n2. Petitioner erroneously claims that the City\u2019s \nsubsidy \npolicy \ndistinguished \nbetween \n\u201cnormal \nretirees\u201d and disabled retirees. Pet. Br. 11.1 However, \nthe phrase \u201cnormal retiree\u201d appears nowhere in the \nordinance. See Doc. 38-10 at 2-5. Rather, the ordinance \nshows that any retiree, disabled or non-disabled, with \n25 years of service is eligible for the subsidy to age 65. \nDoc. 38-10 at 4, \u00b6 2.45(C), (G). The ordinance did not \ncondition the subsidy to age 65 on a \u201cnormal \nretirement\u201d because under the City\u2019s pension plan, a \n\u201cnormal retirement\u201d could be taken after only ten (10) \nyears of service. Doc. 39-17 at 27; J.A. 35, n. 2.  \nPetitioner, like everyone else, was eligible to \nreceive the full subsidy so long as she served 25 years. \nHowever, in 2018, she requested and was awarded a \n\u201cdisability retirement\u201d with only 20 years of service. \nDoc. 38-5.2 But even though she failed to fulfill the \nservice-based criteria, the City, out of compassion, \nprovided 24 months of the subsidy to its totally \ndisabled retirees who retired early short of 25 years. \nDoc. 38-10 at 4, \u00b6 2.45(C), (F), (G); J.A. 34-35, 40; Doc. \n38 at 21-22. Uncoincidentally, 24 months is exactly \nhow long it takes before a totally disabled retiree like \nPetitioner is eligible to receive Medicare benefits. See \nMedicare Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 426(b)(2)(A), 1395o(a)(1). \n\u0003\n1 Petitioner cites to Doc. 39-16 for this proposition but omits key \nlanguage from that document which shows that the policy was \nbased solely on years of service and not a \u201cnormal\u201d retirement.  \n2 Petitioner insinuates that she was disabled \u201cin the line of duty.\u201d \nPet. Br. 1, 11. The record shows she was not. Doc. 38-5. \n\n8 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nSimilarly situated, non-disabled retirees with only 20 \nyears\u2019 service received no subsidy at all and they are \nnot Medicare eligible because they are not disabled. \nDoc. 38-10 at 4, \u00b6 2.45(C); J.A. 34-35, 44. Thus, far \nfrom treating Petitioner worse because of her \ndisability than her non-disabled co-workers with the \nsame amount of service, she was treated better than \nthem because of her total disability.  \nAlthough the City would have liked to continue \npaying disability retirees with less than 25 years the \nsame subsidy as 25-year retirees, it was forced to cut \ncosts and start treating disability retirees the same as, \nrather than better than, everyone else with less than \n25 years of service. Doc. 38-10 at 2; J.A. 34 n. 1, 40. \nPrior to the 2003 ordinance, the City had the resources \nto pay the subsidy to age 65 for both 25-year retirees \nand \u201cdisability retirees\u201d with less than 25 years. \nHowever, the City was permitted to change that policy \nbefore Petitioner\u2019s rights vested at retirement. Florida \nSheriffs Ass'n v. Dep't of Admin., Div. of Ret., 408 So. \n2d 1033, 1036-37 (Fla. 1981). \nPetitioner claims (at 11) that the City\u2019s HR \nDirector could not explain why the City changed the \nsubsidy policy. He was deposed nearly twenty years \nafter the ordinance was passed and thus his \nknowledge of it was limited to what could be discerned \nfrom the public records. Doc. 39-4 at 1, 10, 80. The \ndistrict court found that the purpose was clearly set \nforth in the ordinance itself and the City articulated \nits legitimate reasons for its service-based policy to \nreward long-term employment, contain costs, and \nprovide compassion for employees who retire early due \nto disability. J.A. 34 n. 1, 40, 45. The City\u2019s policy \n\n9 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nprovided disabled employees access to the same \nbenefits available to all. Doc. 38-10 at 4, \u00b6 2.45(C).  \nC. Procedural Background \n1. The City moved to dismiss Petitioner\u2019s ADA \nclaim because she only alleged post-employment \ndiscrimination when she was no longer a \u201cqualified \nindividual.\u201d Doc. 14 at 4-5. Petitioner did not dispute \nthe City\u2019s characterization of her allegations or argue \nthat her complaint actually alleged discrimination \nduring her employment. See Doc. 17. Petitioner also \ndid not move for leave to amend to add allegations of \ndiscrimination during employment. \nTherefore, \nthe \ndistrict \ncourt \ndismissed \nPetitioner\u2019s ADA claim because she alleged the \n\u201cdiscrimination did not occur until Plaintiff was no \nlonger able to perform the essential functions of her \njob\u201d when she was no longer a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d \nPet. App. 26a. After dismissal, Petitioner did not move \nfor reconsideration arguing the court misapprehended \nany allegations of discrimination during employment.  \nOn her Equal Protection Clause Claim, the \ndistrict court found the policy drew \u201cneutral\u201d lines \nbased on service requiring all retirees to serve 25 \nyears to earn the subsidy to age 65. J.A. 44-45. \n2. Petitioner\u2019s initial brief in the Eleventh Circuit \nconfirmed that her complaint only alleged post-\nemployment discrimination because she argued she \n\u201ccould not have brought these claims while she was \nstill employed\u201d because \u201cshe would have lacked \nstanding.\u201d Pet. C.A. Br. 22. The Eleventh Circuit \ntherefore refused to pass upon this issue expressly \n\n10 \n\u0003\n\u0003\ndisclaimed \nin \nher \ninitial \nbrief \nand \nuntimely \ncontradicted in her reply brief. Pet. App. 17a.  \nNext, the Eleventh Circuit analyzed whether the \nCity\u2019s post-employment application of the subsidy \npolicy was, in its own right, a fresh violation of Title I, \nrather \nthan \nan \nalleged \nextension \nof \npast \ndiscrimination. Pet. App. 16a. In doing so, it found \nthat nothing in the Ledbetter Act \u201cchanges Title I\u2019s \nsubstantive requirements,\u201d including the requirement \nthat one be a \u201cqualified individual\u201d at the time of the \ndiscriminatory act. Pet. App. 15a. It held the \nLedbetter Act\u2019s \u201crelaxed statute of limitations helps a \nplaintiff only if that plaintiff otherwise has a claim for \ndiscrimination.\u201d Id.  \nTherefore, it adhered to its precedent holding that \nTitle I is unambiguous and contains a \u201cclear temporal \nqualifier\u201d stating \u201c[o]nly someone \u2018who, with or \nwithout reasonable accommodation, can perform the \nessential functions of the employment position that \nsuch individual holds or desires\u201d is protected from \ndisability discrimination. Pet. App. 11a (emphasis in \noriginal). It concluded that \u201c[b]ecause Stanley cannot \nestablish that the City committed any discriminatory \nacts against her while she could perform the essential \nfunctions of a job that she held or desired to hold, her \nTitle I claim fails.\u201d Pet. App. 18a. \n\u0003\n \n\n11 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI. Part I of Petitioner\u2019s brief is unrelated to the \ncircuit-split question upon which this Court granted \ncertiorari regarding whether discrimination occurring \nentirely post-employment is actionable under the \nADA. Instead, Part I seeks review of a different \nquestion regarding whether Petitioner sufficiently \nalleged discrimination during her employment as a \n\u201cqualified individual.\u201d Petitioner argues her ADA \nclaim allegedly accrued in 2003 when the City passed \nits subsidy policy. She admits she was not disabled at \nthat time but argues Title I did not require her to have \na disability to sue for disability discrimination. She \nheavily relies on the minimal standing requirements \nin the enforcement provisions of Title I and Title VII. \nBut Title I\u2019s enforcement provision only applies to \n\u201cany person alleging discrimination on the basis of \ndisability in violation of any provision of this chapter.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12117(a) (emphasis added). This is a \n\u201ccross-reference\u2026directing us to a class of claims with \na settled and statutorily precise meaning.\u201d Almond v. \nUnified Sch. Dist. No. 501, 665 F.3d 1174, 1181 (10th \nCir. 2011).  \nThe ADA\u2019s \u201cclass of claims\u201d are found in its \nsubstantive anti-discrimination provision, \u00a7 12112(a), \nwhich has a settled meaning requiring Petitioner to \nshow: \u201c(1) that she was disabled under the ADA; (2) \nthat she was a qualified individual with a disability; \nand (3) that she was discriminated against by her \nemployer because of that disability.\u201d Dunlap v. Liberty \nNat. Prod., Inc., 878 F.3d 794, 798\u201399 (9th Cir. 2017). \nBecause Petitioner conceded that she did not have a \ndisability in 2003 and further conceded that she \n\n12 \n\u0003\n\u0003\n\u201clacked standing\u201d to sue for anything occurring \u201cwhile \nshe was still employed,\u201d Pet. C.A. Br. 22, the Eleventh \nCircuit correctly declined to pass upon whether her \nallegations sufficiently alleged she was discriminated \nagainst as a \u201cqualified individual\u201d at any time before \nshe retired.  Pet. App. 17a. \nThe Eleventh Circuit also correctly held that the \nLedbetter Act did not change Title I\u2019s substantive \nrequirement that she be a \u201cqualified individual\u201d with \na disability at the time of the alleged discrimination. \nId. 15a. Because she only alleged discrimination \noccurring entirely post-employment when she could no \nlonger perform the essential functions of her job, she \nwas not a \u201cqualified individual\u201d entitled to sue.  \nII. The Eleventh Circuit correctly held that Title \nI\u2019s use of the present tense unambiguously prohibits \ndiscrimination solely against an individual who \u201ccan \nperform\u201d the job she presently \u201cholds or desires.\u201d Id. \n11a-12a. This reading is consistent with the ADA\u2019s \nstatutory scheme which uses the term \u201cindividuals\u201d to \nbroadly include former employees, but \u201cqualified \nindividuals\u201d to refer only to current employees. And it \ngives effect to every word in the definition and the \ngeneral rule where it appears.  \nPetitioner\u2019s interpretation requires this Court to \nrewrite Title I to include an exception to the \u201ccan \nperform\u201d clause for retirees. It is based on a policy \npreference to avoid what she perceives as an \u201cabsurd\u201d \nconsequence of the express line drawn by Congress. \nHowever, \u201cCongress could reasonably decide to enable \ndisabled people who can work with reasonable \naccommodation to get and keep jobs, without also \ndeciding to equalize post-employment fringe benefits \n\n13 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nfor people who cannot work.\u201d Weyer v. Twentieth \nCentury Fox Film Corp., 198 F.3d 1104, 1112 (9th Cir. \n2000). The Eleventh Circuit correctly refused to allow \npolicy preference or purpose\u2014even purpose as most \nnarrowly defined\u2014to negate the plain language of the \nstatute.  \nARGUMENT \nThe question presented, as inaccurately framed \nby Petitioner, asks under the ADA, \u201cdoes a former \nemployee\u2014who was qualified to perform her job and \nwho \nearned \npost-employment \nbenefits \nwhile \nemployed\u2014lose her right to sue over discrimination \nwith respect to those benefits solely because she no \nlonger holds her job?\u201d Pet. Br. i. A former employee \nwho has a \u201cright to sue\u201d cannot \u201close\u201d that right \n\u201csolely\u201d because she no longer holds her job. If so, there \ncould be no ADA claim for a discriminatory \ntermination\u2014a claim the Eleventh Circuit has \npermitted former employees to bring. See Taylor v. \nFood World, Inc., 133 F.3d 1419 (11th Cir. 1998).  \nThe Eleventh Circuit held that to \u201cfall within Title \nI\u2019s anti-discrimination provision, a plaintiff\u2019s claim \nmust depend on an act committed by the defendant \nwhile the plaintiff was either working for the \ndefendant or seeking to work for the defendant.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 8a-9a. This holding clearly makes room for \nformer employees to sue if they were discriminated \nagainst during their employment. Because the \nEleventh Circuit did not hold that former employees \nare categorically barred from suing under the ADA, \nPetitioner is not entitled to a reversal based on a \nruling that was never made.  \n\n14 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nThe \ncircuit-split \nquestion \nis \nwhether \ndiscrimination occurring entirely post-employment \nagainst \ntotally \ndisabled \nformer \nemployees, \nis \nactionable under Title I. The Eleventh Circuit, siding \nwith the majority, held that \u201c[b]ecause Stanley cannot \nestablish that the City committed any discriminatory \nacts against her while she could perform the essential \nfunctions of a job that she held or desired to hold, her \nTitle I claim fails.\u201d Pet. App. 18a.  \nTherefore, Part I of Petitioner\u2019s brief framing the \nissue as whether \u201c[t]he ADA permits former \nemployees to bring suit with respect to post-\nemployment benefits,\u201d attacks a strawman. Pet. Br. \n17. As the Eleventh Circuit never categorically barred \nsuch suits, Petitioner reveals the real alleged errors \nfor this Court\u2019s review deep into Part I(C)(2). Id. 24-\n27. In doing so, she has \u201csmuggl[ed] additional \nquestions into\u201d the case \u201cafter [this Court] grant[ed] \ncertiorari.\u201d Irvine v. People of California, 347 U.S. 128, \n129 (1954).  \nCompletely unrelated to the circuit-split question \nregarding whether post-employment discrimination \nagainst former employees is actionable under Title I, \nPetitioner argues the Eleventh Circuit erred by: (1) \nfinding that she disclaimed standing to sue for \ndiscrimination occurring during her employment, Pet. \nBr. 24, 27; (2) misapplying Title I\u2019s \u201cdisability\u201d \nelement to the facts of this case, Id. 25; and (3) not \napplying the Ledbetter Act to find her time-barred \nclaims allegedly accruing during employment \u201cre-\naccrued in 2020,\u201d Id. 24.  \nNone \nof \nthese \nquestions \nare \n\u201csubsidiary \nquestion[s] fairly included\u201d in the circuit-split \n\n15 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nquestion. Yee v. City of Escondido, Cal., 503 U.S. 519, \n535 (1992). Instead, Petitioner has relegated the \ncircuit-split question to her secondary argument for \nreversal. Pet. Br., Part II, 27. Remarkably, she argues \nthat this Court \u201cneed not even reach\u201d the circuit-split \nquestion and should reverse based solely on the above \nthree alleged misapplications of law to fact. Pet. Br. \n17. This is backwards. This Court should ignore Part \nI and proceed solely to resolving the circuit-split \nquestion in Part II. But to the extent this Court \nreviews Part I, it should find that she waived these \narguments, and any claim of discrimination during \nemployment is unpled and time-barred. \nI. \nThe Non-Circuit-Split Questions Regarding \nDiscrimination During Employment \nIn support of her argument of discrimination \nduring employment when she was a \u201cqualified \nindividual,\u201d Petitioner provides a truncated version of \nTitle I\u2019s enforcement and substantive provisions \nomitting crucial elements under \u00a7 12112(a). Pet. Br. \n17-23. She argues merely pleading that she was \n\u201caggrieved\u201d regarding her post-employment benefits, \nwith the aid of the Ledbetter Act, brings her \u201cclaim \nacross the finish line.\u201d Pet. Br. 21.  \nHer claim, however, never got off the starting \nblocks because she expressly disclaimed standing to \nsue for anything occurring during her employment. \nPet. C.A. Br. 22. To be sure, her initial brief in the \nEleventh Circuit argued: \nMs. Stanley could not have brought these \nclaims while she was still employed and able \nto do her job because she had not yet learned \n\n16 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nof the discrimination and become a disability \nretiree impacted by the discrimination so she \nwould have lacked standing. \nId. (emphasis added). Even in the absence of this \ndisclaimer, her complaint failed to demonstrate that a \nTitle I claim accrued during her employment or that \nany such claim was timely. Determining the \ntimeliness of Petitioner\u2019s 2019 EEOC charge required \nher \u201cto identify precisely the \u2018unlawful employment \npractice\u2019 of which\u201d she complains. Delaware State Coll. \nv. Ricks, 449 U.S. 250, 257 (1980).  \nPetitioner argues her claims accrued during her \nemployment: (1) in 2003 when the City adopted its \nsubsidy policy; (2) when she became disabled during \nemployment; and (3) at some unspecified time when it \nbecame \u201cinevitable\u201d that she would need to take a \ndisability retirement prior to her retirement on \nNovember 1, 2018. Pet. Br. 24-26. These arguments \ncannot be squared with the allegations of the \ncomplaint. And Petitioner has waived them.  \nA. Petitioner disclaimed and her complaint \nfailed to demonstrate any claim accrued \nin 2003 when the City adopted its \nsubsidy policy.  \n1. \nThe \nEleventh \nCircuit \nfound \nPetitioner \n\u201cconcedes, and we agree, that her claim cannot turn on \nthe 2003 amendment to the benefits plan because she \nwas not yet disabled at that time.\u201d Pet. App. 16a. \nPetitioner admitted in her initial brief that the City \nadopted its subsidy policy \u201cin 2003, when Ms. Stanley \nwas a non-disabled employee.\u201d Pet. C.A. Br. 22 n. 5. \nShe then conceded she \u201clacked standing\u201d to bring \n\n17 \n\u0003\n\u0003\n\u201cthese claims while she was still employed and able to \ndo her job\u201d because she was not yet a \u201cdisability retiree \nimpacted by the discrimination.\u201d Pet. C.A. Br. 22 \n(emphasis added). Although Petitioner purported to \nincorporate the United States\u2019 contrary arguments \ninto her initial brief, Pet. C.A. Br. 20, the Eleventh \nCircuit was not required to scour the amicus brief for \nbetter arguments to save Petitioner\u2019s case. The \nEleventh Circuit properly relied on her arguments in \nher brief expressly disclaiming standing to sue for \nanything during her employment.  \nPetitioner and the United States attempt to \nexplain away her concessions by arguing she only \nmeant to disclaim any financial impact during her \nemployment. Pet. Br. 27; U.S. Am. Br. 27-28. This \nargument cannot be squared with her clear concession \nthat she \u201clacked standing\u201d to sue \u201cwhile she was still \nemployed.\u201d Pet. C.A. Br. 22. Indeed, financial impact \nis not necessary for standing, but an injury is. Her way \nof describing \u201cinjury\u201d was by using the word \u201cimpact\u201d \nbecause otherwise she would not have disclaimed \nstanding simply because she suffered no financial \nimpact during employment.  \nIt is true that this Court\u2019s \u201cpractice \u2018permit[s] \nreview of an issue not pressed [below] so long as it has \nbeen passed upon.\u2019\u201d Citizens United v. Fed. Election \nComm'n, 558 U.S. 310, 330 (2010). To the extent that \nthe Eleventh Circuit passed upon this issue by \n\u201cagree[ing]\u201d with Petitioner's concession that \u201cher \nclaim cannot turn on the 2003\u201d adoption of the policy, \nPet. App. 16a, prudential concerns weigh in favor of \nthis Court declining to review this matter. A mere \nfailure to \u201cpress\u201d an argument is markedly different \n\n18 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nthan an express disclaimer of an argument because \nthe latter invites the complained-of error. See City of \nSpringfield, Mass. v. Kibbe, 480 U.S. 257, 259 \n(1987) (rejecting argument \u201cthat we need not concern \nourselves about Springfield's failure to preserve this \nissue, because it was passed on by the Court of \nAppeals\u201d because \u201cthere would be considerable \nprudential objection to reversing a judgment because \nof instructions that petitioner accepted, and indeed \nitself requested.\u201d).  \nFurther, while an appellant can raise on appeal \nany new \u201cargument\u201d in support of a \u201cclaim,\u201d U.S. \nAmicus Br. 28 n. 6, it cannot wait until its reply brief \nto flip-flop on a position in true ambush fashion as \nPetitioner did here. Compare Pet. C.A. Br. 22 with Pet. \nC.A. Reply Br. 5. This Court should hold that because \nPetitioner \u201craised this issue for the first time in [her] \nreply \nbrief,\u201d \nshe \n\u201chas \nwaived \nthis \nclaim.\u201d \nUnited States v. Dicter, 198 F.3d 1284, 1289 (11th Cir. \n1999). \n2. Even if Petitioner hadn\u2019t expressly disclaimed \nthe argument below, her allegations were still \ninsufficient to demonstrate that a claim accrued in \n2003. Although she concedes she was not disabled \nthen, she incorrectly argues she was not required to \nhave a disability at that time to bring suit. Pet. Br. 25.  \nTitle I\u2019s enforcement provision, \u00a7 12117(a), \nincorporates Title VII\u2019s remedial framework which \nstates any \u201cperson claiming to be aggrieved\u201d can bring \n\u201ca civil action.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1). This Court \nhas held that \u201caggrieved\u201d in Title VII \u201cenabl[es] suit \nby any plaintiff with an interest arguably [sought] to \nbe protected by the statute...while excluding plaintiffs \n\n19 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nwho might technically be injured in an Article III \nsense but whose interests are unrelated to the \nstatutory prohibitions in Title VII.\u201d Thompson v. N. \nAm. Stainless, LP, 562 U.S. 170, 178 (2011) (internal \nquotation \nmarks \nand \ncitation \nomitted). \nPut \ndifferently, the requirement that the plaintiff be \n\u201caggrieved\u201d is a requirement that the plaintiff have \n\u201cstatutory\u201d standing to sue. Id. at 177-78. \nBut, here, Petitioner failed to allege Article III or \nstatutory standing to sue in 2003. Her claim is based \non \u201cher disability.\u201d Doc. 1, \u00b6 26. And yet, she was not \ndisabled in 2003 and therefore not injured by a policy \nthat allegedly discriminated only against the disabled. \nSee Bostock v. Clayton Cnty., Georgia, 590 U.S. 644, \n681 \n(2020) \n(\u201cDiscriminate \nagainst\u201d \nmeans \n\u201cdistinctions or differences in treatment that injure \nprotected individuals.\u201d).  \nHer claim was not based on the disability of \nsomeone else with whom she associated under \u00a7 \n12112(b)(4), nor was it based on a claim that she was \nmerely \u201cregarded as\u201d disabled under \u00a7 12102(1)(C). \nSee Murray v. Warren Pumps, LLC, 821 F.3d 77, 83 \n(1st Cir. 2016) (a plaintiff must prove her \u201cparticular \ntheory of disability discrimination alleged.\u201d). Based on \nPetitioner\u2019s particular theory in her complaint, she \nwas required to show that she was discriminated \nagainst because of her disability \u201cwhich requires that \nthe disability exist at the time of the discrimination.\u201d \nWeyer, 198 F.3d at 1112.  \nPetitioner argues that the ADAAA of 2008 \nrepealed any requirement that she have a disability to \nsue for a claim allegedly accruing in 2003. Pet. Br. 25. \nThe ADAAA amended \u00a7 12112(a) to prohibit \n\n20 \n\u0003\n\u0003\ndiscrimination \u201cagainst a qualified individual on the \nbasis of disability\u201d rather than \u201cagainst a qualified \nindividual with a disability because of the disability.\u201d \nPub. L. No. 110-325, \u00a7 5(a)(1), 122 Stat. 3557 (2008) \n(emphasis added). However, the Eleventh Circuit and \nits \u201csister circuits...hold that the switch from \u2018because \nof\u2019 to \u2018on the basis of\u2019 in the 2008 amendment to the \nADA did not change or affect its but-for causation \nstandard.\u201d Akridge v. Alfa Ins. Companies, 93 F.4th \n1181, 1192 (11th Cir. 2024). \nThis \namendment \nremoved \nthe \nredundant \nlanguage, \u201cwith a disability because of the disability\u201d \nfrom \u00a7 12112(a) because those words were already \nrepeated several times in the \u201cconstruction\u201d provision, \n\u00a7 12112(b). Section 12112(b)(1), for example, still \nprohibits \n\u201cclassifying \na \njob \napplicant \nor \nemployee...because of the disability of such applicant \nor employee.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(1) (emphasis \nadded). \nThe express purpose of the ADAAA was to \u201creject\u201d \ndecisions of this Court, which Congress found \ninterpreted the definition of a \u201cdisability\u201d too \nnarrowly. Pub. L. No. 110-325, \u00a7 2(b). Congress stated \nthe amendment\u2019s purpose was to clarify \u201cthat the \nquestion of whether an individual's impairment is a \ndisability under the ADA should not demand \nextensive analysis.\u201d Id. at \u00a7 2(b)(5). Therefore, the \nchanges removed the prior emphasis on whether an \nindividual\u2019s impairment met the definition of a \n\u201cdisability.\u201d Congress did not remove the requirement \nthat an individual have a disability all together. \n3. Even if the ADAAA did dispense with the \n\u201cdisability\u201d element, the United States acknowledges \n\n21 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nthat the \u201cADAAA\u2019s amendments...apply to claims that \narose after\u201d January 1, 2009. U.S. Amicus Br. 24 n. 4. \nTherefore, any claim allegedly accruing in 2003 would \nbe governed by the ADA, before the ADAAA allegedly \ndisposed of the disability element.  \n4. Petitioner makes a last-ditch effort to root her \nclaim in 2003 when she was a \u201cqualified individual\u201d by \narguing this Court may \u201cconceive of this claim as \nencompassing two moments of time that complete the \nwhole: when the facially discriminatory policy was \nadopted in 2003, and when Lt. Stanley became \ndisabled.\u201d Pet. Br. 26. However, this Court has \nrecognized that Title VII claims can encompass \ndifferent events at different points in time only in two \nnarrow circumstances: hostile work environment \nclaims and constructive discharge claims. Green v. \nBrennan, 578 U.S. 547, 556-57 (2016). Moreover, \nPetitioner has expressly waived any argument of \ndiscrimination at any time during her employment. \nPet. C.A. Br. 22.  \nB. Petitioner disclaimed and her complaint \nfailed to demonstrate a claim accrued at \nany time between her diagnosis and \nretirement.  \n1. The Eleventh Circuit expressly declined to pass \nupon Petitioner\u2019s untimely argument raised in her \nreply brief that a claim accrued \u201cat some unknown \npoint before she retired but after she was diagnosed \nwith Parkinson\u2019s.\u201d Pet. App. 17a. This Court should \ndecline to \u201cdecide in the first instance issues not \ndecided below.\u201d Reagan Nat'l Advert. of Austin, LLC, \n596 U.S. at 76.  \n\n22 \n\u0003\n\u0003\n2. But if this Court proceeds, it must determine \nwhether the complaint alleged that Petitioner was a \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d with a disability during her \nemployment. She must allege that she became \ndisabled \u201cduring the course of [her] employment but \nnevertheless continued to perform the essential \nrequirements of [her] job with or without a reasonable \naccommodation, until [she] became completely and \ntotally disabled.\u201d Bass v. City of Orlando, 57 F. Supp. \n2d 1318, 1323 (M.D. Fla. 1999), aff'd, 203 F.3d 841 \n(11th Cir. 1999). Contrary to the United States\u2019 \nclaims, Petitioner\u2019s complaint does not allege when or \nhow she became disabled, let alone that she continued \nto work thereafter. U.S. Amicus Br. 26. Petitioner only \nalleged that because of a \u201cphysical disability\u201d she took \na disability retirement in 2018 and as a result would \nlose the subsidy in 2020. Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 16, 26.  \nAlthough we now have the benefit of the summary \njudgment record on her Equal Protection claim, in \ntesting the sufficiency of a complaint, a district court \ndoes not \u201cassume that the [plaintiff] can prove facts \nthat it has not alleged or that the defendants have \nviolated...laws in ways that have not been alleged.\u201d \nAssociated Gen. Contractors of California, Inc. v. \nCalifornia State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, \n526 (1983); see also Aldana v. Del Monte Fresh \nProduce, N.A., Inc., 416 F.3d 1242, 1248 (11th Cir. \n2005) (a plaintiff must \u201callege sufficient facts to \nwarrant [a particular] inference\u201d). \nPetitioner led the district court to its conclusion \nwhen she failed to dispute the City\u2019s argument for \ndismissal that she only alleged post-employment \ndiscrimination when she was no longer a \u201cqualified \n\n23 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nindividual.\u201d Doc. 14 at 4-5; Doc. 17. Instead, she \nmerely argued that the district court should refuse to \nfollow Eleventh Circuit precedent in Gonzales (a case \ninvolving only post-employment discrimination). Doc. \n17 at 5-6. As the Eleventh Circuit noted, she did not \nattempt to distinguish the facts of Gonzales from her \ncase by arguing that she alleged discrimination during \nemployment. Pet. App. 18a. The district court, thus, \nproperly dismissed her ADA claim because her \ncomplaint \u201calleged [the] discrimination did not occur \nuntil Plaintiff was no longer able to perform the \nessential functions of her job.\u201d Doc. 27 at 7. \nFurther, the district court was \u201cnot required to \ngrant\u2026plaintiff leave to amend [her] complaint sua \nsponte when the plaintiff, who is represented by \ncounsel, never filed a motion to amend nor requested \nleave to amend before the district court.\u201d Wagner v. \nDaewoo Heavy Indus. Am. Corp., 314 F.3d 541, 542 \n(11th Cir. 2002). After dismissal, Petitioner did not \nmove \nfor \nreconsideration \narguing \nthe \ncourt \nmisapprehended her complaint allegedly pleading \ndiscrimination during employment. Perhaps fearing \nher claims would be time-barred, she never argued \nthey arose during her employment, years before she \nfiled her 2019 EEOC charge. Indeed, she never \nmentioned the generous accrual provisions of the \nLedbetter Act in the district court. Doc. 1, \u00b6 6.  \nPetitioner\u2019s initial brief in the Eleventh Circuit \nconfirmed that her complaint only alleged post-\nemployment discrimination because she argued she \n\u201ccould not have brought these claims while she was \nstill employed\u201d because \u201cshe would have lacked \nstanding.\u201d Pet. C.A. Br. 22. The Eleventh Circuit \n\n24 \n\u0003\n\u0003\ntherefore properly refused to pass upon this issue \nexpressly disclaimed in her initial brief and untimely \ncontradicted in her reply brief. Pet. App. 17a. This \nCourt should decline to decide this unpreserved issue \nin the first instance, and as demonstrated above, it is \nunsupported by her allegations.  \nC. The Ledbetter Act\u2019s generous accrual \nprovisions do not create a claim where \nnone exists. \nIt is clear that if a claim accrued in 2003, it \nexpired long before Petitioner filed her EEOC charge \nin 2019. Doc. 1, \u00b6 6. Petitioner argues that under the \nLedbetter Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e5(e)(3)(A), her 2003 \nclaim \u201cre-accrued in 2020\u201d when she \u201cwas \u2018affected\u2019 \nwhen her subsidy ended.\u201d Pet. Br. 24, 26 n. 1. The \nLedbetter Act has no place here.  \n\u201cOrdinarily, a limitations period commences \nwhen the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of \naction.\u201d Green v. Brennan, 578 U.S. 547, 554 (2016) \n(cleaned up). \u201c[A] cause of action does not become \n\u2018complete and present\u2019 for limitations purposes until \nthe plaintiff can file suit and obtain relief.\u201d Id. (cleaned \nup). Petitioner failed to demonstrate she had a \n\u201ccomplete and present\u201d claim during her employment.  \nIndeed, \nany \nclaim \nof \ndisability-based \ndiscrimination in 2003 when she was not disabled \nwould have been dismissed for lack of standing, as she \nconceded below but refuses to admit now. Pet. Br. C.A. \n22. If no claim accrued in 2003, it could not \u201cre-accrue\u201d \npost-employment. \u201cA plaintiff must plead and prove \nthe elements of a pay-discrimination claim to benefit \nfrom the Ledbetter Act's accrual provisions.\u201d Davis v. \n\n25 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nBombardier Transp. Holdings (USA) Inc., 794 F.3d \n266, 269 (2d Cir. 2015); see also AT & T Corp. v. \nHulteen, 556 U.S. 701, 716 (2009) (Ledbetter Act did \nnot save the plaintiff\u2019s untimely claim because the \noriginal \nemployment \npractice \n\u201cwas \nnot \ndiscriminatory\u201d). The Ledbetter Act \u201cis an accrual \nrule; it does not affect the substance of the claim.\u201d \nMcReynolds v. Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc., 694 F.3d 873, \n888 (7th Cir. 2012). Therefore, the Eleventh Circuit \ncorrectly held the Ledbetter Act\u2019s \u201crelaxed statute of \nlimitations helps a plaintiff only if that plaintiff \notherwise has a claim for discrimination.\u201d Pet. App. \n15a. \nThe Eleventh Circuit did not pass upon whether \nthe Ledbetter Act should apply to allow a Title I claim \nto \u201cre-accrue\u201d when an individual is \u201caffected\u201d post-\nemployment when she is no longer qualified. This \nCourt should decline to decide this issue in the first \ninstance. This is especially so where Petitioner has not \nshown that the facts of Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & \nRubber Co., 550 U.S. 618 (2007), which prompted the \nLedbetter Act, are sufficiently similar to the subject \nfacts to warrant extension of the Act here. Unlike the \nsecret decisions creating an unknown pay disparity for \nMs. Ledbetter, the City\u2019s subsidy policy was a publicly \nannounced act codified in its ordinances and \u201cofficial \npersonnel policies.\u201d Doc. 1, \u00b6 24; see also Doc. 38-10 at \n2-5; Doc. 38-11 at 4. Such fully communicated acts can \nbe vindicated \u201cwithout the need for the Ledbetter Act's \ngenerous accrual provisions because the employee had \nnotice of the pay reduction.\u201d Davis, 794 F.3d at 271.  \nPetitioner\u2019s later testimony claiming ignorance of \nthe ordinance is irrelevant. See Taylor v. Michael, 724 \n\n26 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nF.3d 806, 811 (7th Cir.2013) (\u201cLack of familiarity with \nthe law...is not a circumstance that justifies equitable \ntolling.\u201d). Therefore, the City\u2019s policy is akin to the \nemployment practice at issue in Ricks, not Ledbetter. \nIn Ricks, \u201cthe only alleged discrimination occurred\u2013\nand \nthe \nfiling \nlimitations \nperiods \ntherefore \ncommenced\u2013at the time the tenure decision was made \nand communicated to Ricks.\u201d 449 U.S. at 258. \u201cThat is \nso even though one of the effects of the denial of \ntenure\u2013the eventual loss of a teaching position\u2013did \nnot occur until later.\u201d Id. For such acts, \u201cthe clock \nstarts running when the plaintiff first knew or should \nhave known of his injury, whether or not he realized \nthe cause of his injury was unlawful.\u201d Almond, 665 \nF.3d at 1176.  \nTo extend the Ledbetter Act under the facts of this \ncase would open the floodgates to stale claims over \nknown, written personnel policies and publicly \nannounced ordinances. And it would allow plaintiffs to \ndelay suit indefinitely, despite knowing exactly when \na benefit will end, by arguing that the claim \u201cre-\naccrues\u201d every month that the plaintiff does not \nreceive the benefit. See, e.g., Lohrasbi v. Bd. of \nTrustees of the Univ. of Illinois, 147 F. Supp. 3d 746, \n755 (C.D. Ill. 2015) (\u201c[T]he 300-day time-limit does not \nrestart each day that Plaintiff is deprived of Professor \nEmiritus status.\u201d). The Ledbetter Act has no place \nhere and any claims that allegedly accrued during \nPetitioner\u2019s employment have long-since expired and \nbeen waived.    \n\n27 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nII. The \nCircuit \nSplit \nQuestion \nRegarding \nDiscrimination Post-Employment \nThis Court should only resolve the question \nsplitting the circuit courts: whether totally disabled \nretirees are \u201cqualified individuals\u201d entitled to seek \nrelief under Title I for discrimination occurring \nentirely post-employment. The Eleventh Circuit below \n(at Pet. App. 11a-12a) and \u201cthe majority of courts have \nheld, Title I is unambiguous; by its plain language, it \ndoes not\u201d prohibit discrimination against \u201cformer \nemployees who are unable to perform the essential \nfunctions of their jobs.\u201d McKnight v. Gen. Motors \nCorp., 550 F.3d 519, 528 (6th Cir. 2008); Morgan v. \nJoint Admin. Bd., 268 F.3d 456, 458\u201359 (7th Cir. \n2001); Weyer v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp., 198 \nF.3d 1104, 1112 (9th Cir. 2000).   \nOnly two circuits have disagreed and held that \nTitle I is ambiguous because it allegedly fails to \n\u201cspecify when a potential plaintiff must have been a \n\u2018qualified individual\u2019...\u201d Castellano v. City of New York, \n142 F.3d 58, 67 (2d Cir. 1998) (emphasis in original); \nFord v. Schering-Plough Corp., 145 F.3d 601, 606 (3d \nCir. 1998). The Third Circuit also found an ambiguity, \nnot in the text, but in the \u201cdisjunction between the \nADA\u2019s definition of \u2018qualified individual with a \ndisability\u2019 and the rights that the ADA confers.\u201d Ford, \n145 F.3d at 605. \nAs \nthe \nEleventh \nCircuit \nexplained \nbelow \n\u201c[n]either court established that the text of Title I\u2019s \nanti-discrimination provision is ambiguous.\u201d Pet. App. \n12a. \u201cInstead, the Second and the Third Circuit \nexpressed \nsomething \nbetween \ndiscomfort \nand \ndisagreement with the policy choice underlying the \n\n28 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nline, drawn by the text of the ADA, between disabled \nindividuals who hold or desire to hold a job and those \nwho do not.\u201d Pet. App. 12a. \u201cBut not \u2018even the most \nformidable policy arguments\u2019 empower a court to \nignore unambiguous text.\u201d Id. (citation omitted). And \nthat text plainly prohibits discrimination solely \nagainst individuals who \u201ccan perform the essential \nfunctions\u201d of the job \u201cthat such individual holds or \ndesires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12111(8), 12112(a). \nA. Title I requires an individual to hold or \ndesire \na \njob \nat \nthe \ntime \nof \nthe \ndiscriminatory act to be a \u201cqualified \nindividual.\u201d \nThe first step \u201cin interpreting a statute is to \ndetermine whether the language at issue has a plain \nand unambiguous meaning with regard to the \nparticular dispute in the case.\u201d Robinson v. Shell Oil \nCo., 519 U.S. 337, 340 (1997). \u201cThe plainness or \nambiguity of statutory language is determined by \nreference to the language itself, the specific context in \nwhich that language is used, and the broader context \nof the statute as a whole.\u201d Id. at 341. \n1. \nThe text uses the present tense as a \ntemporal \nqualifier \nto \nprohibit \ndiscrimination solely against an \nindividual who \u201ccan perform\u201d the \njob she presently \u201cholds or desires.\u201d      \na. Title I\u2019s anti-discrimination provision (the \n\u201cgeneral rule\u201d) and its incorporated definition of a \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d are unambiguous. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 \n12112(a), 12111(8). The \u201cgeneral rule\u201d makes it \nunlawful for an employer to \u201cdiscriminate against a \n\n29 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nqualified individual on the basis of disability in regard \nto \njob \napplication \nprocedures, \nthe \nhiring, \nadvancement, or discharge of employees, employee \ncompensation, \njob \ntraining, \nand \nother \nterms, \nconditions, and privileges of employment.\u201d Id. \u00a7 \n12112(a).  \nSection 12111(8) defines a \u201cqualified individual\u201d \nas \u201can individual who, with or without reasonable \naccommodation, can perform the essential functions of \nthe employment position that such individual holds or \ndesires.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12111(8). Because the general rule \nexpressly incorporates the definition of a \u201cqualified \nindividual,\u201d an \u201cADA plaintiff bears the burden of \nproving that she is...a person \u2018who, with or without \nreasonable accommodation, can perform the essential \nfunctions\u2019 of her job,\u201d Cleveland v. Policy Mgmt. Sys. \nCorp., 526 U.S. 795, 806 (1999), at the time of the \nprohibited discrimination. (emphasis added).  \n\u201cCongress\u2019 use of a verb tense is significant in \nconstruing statutes.\u201d United States v. Wilson, 503 U.S. \n329, 333 (1992). For example, the ADA\u2019s use of \u201cthe \npresent indicative verb form\u201d requires \u201cthat a person \nbe presently\u2026substantially limited in order to \ndemonstrate a disability.\u201d Sutton v. United Air Lines, \nInc., 527 U.S. 471, 482 (1999), superseded, in part, on \nother grounds, ADAAA of 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-325, \u00a7 \n2(b)(3) (emphasis added); Dictionary Act, 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 \n(\u201cIn determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, \nunless the context indicates otherwise...words used in \nthe present tense include the future as well as the \npresent\u201d\u2014not the past). \nSection 12112(a) does not prohibit discrimination \nagainst an individual who performed the job that such \n\n30 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nindividual held or desired. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12112(a), \n12111(8). The present tense is used to require that an \nindividual be able to perform her job at the time of the \ndiscrimination.  \nThis is not to say that a former employee can \nnever sue under Title I. The Eleventh Circuit held she \nmay sue if her claim is based \u201con an act committed by \nthe defendant while the plaintiff was either working \nfor the defendant or seeking to work for the \ndefendant.\u201d Pet. App. 8a-9a. This is because the \ngeneral rule does not require a former employee to be \na \u201cqualified individual\u201d at the time of the lawsuit. See \nid. \u00a7 12112(a). Its focus is on the individual\u2019s \nqualifications at the time of the discriminatory act \nbecause it speaks only in terms of the prohibited \ndiscrimination\u2014not when suit is filed. Id. Any \nmischaracterization of the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s holding \nto categorically exclude retirees from suing under \nTitle I, must be rejected. It correctly held that \n\u201c[b]ecause Stanley cannot establish that the City \ncommitted any discriminatory acts against her while \nshe could perform the essential functions of a job that \nshe held or desired to hold, her Title I claim fails.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 18a.  \nb. This Court\u2019s decision in Robinson reinforces the \nsignificance of present tense verbs as \u201ctemporal \nqualifiers\u201d to limit the scope of a statute\u2019s protection \nto current employees. 519 U.S. at 341-42 & n. 2. The \nquestion in Robinson was whether the word \n\u201cemployees\u201d in Title VII\u2019s anti-retaliation provision, \u00a7 \n704(a), includes former employees. Id. at 339. Section \n704(a) makes it unlawful \u201cfor an employer to \ndiscriminate against any of his employees or \n\n31 \n\u0003\n\u0003\napplicants for employment\u201d who have availed \nthemselves of Title VII\u2019s protections or assisted others \nin so doing. Id. Section 701(f) defines \u201cemployee\u201d as \n\u201can individual employed by an employer.\u201d Id. at 342 \n(emphasis added).  \nThis Court explained that certain features of \u00a7 \n704(a) made it ambiguous and militated in favor of \nreading it to include former employees. Id. at 341. \nFirst, this Court emphasized that \u201cthere is no \ntemporal qualifier\u201d in \u00a7 704(a). Id. Second, the \ndefinition of \u201cemployees\u201d in \u00a7 701(f) was consistent \nwith either current or past employment because the \nword \u201cemployed\u201d used therein could mean \u201cis \nemployed\u201d or \u201cwas employed.\u201d Id. at 342 (emphasis in \noriginal). Thus, this Court concluded that like \u00a7 \n704(a), the definition of \u201cemployees\u201d in \u00a7 701(f) \u201clacks \nany temporal qualifier.\u201d Id.  \nOn this critical \u201ctemporal qualifier\u201d point, this \nCourt distinguished its decision just one month earlier \nin Walters v. Metro. Educational Enters., 519 U.S. 202 \n(1997). Id. at 341 n. 2. In Walters, this Court \nunanimously held that \u201cemployees\u201d as used in \u00a7 701(b) \nrelating to the 15-employee threshold for coverage by \nTitle \nVII, \nunambiguously \nreferred \nto \ncurrent \nemployees only. 519 U.S. at 341, n.2. This was because \n\u00a7 701(b) clearly included \u201ctwo significant temporal \nqualifiers.\u201d Id. This Court noted \u00a7 701(b)\u2019s language \nstating that Title VII \u201capplies to any employer \u2018who \nhas fifteen or more employees for each working day\u2026\u2019\u201d \nId. (emphasis in original). \u201cThe emphasized words \nspecify the time frame in which the employment \nrelationship must exist, and thus the specific context \nof that section did not present the particular \n\n32 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nambiguity at issue in the present case.\u201d Id. Indeed, \u00a7 \n701(b)\u2019s use of the present-tense as a temporal \nqualifier was critical in distinguishing the facts of \nRobinson. \nThe majority of courts have thus correctly \nconcluded that \u201cTitle I, unlike the section of Title VII \nat issue in Robinson, has a \u2018temporal qualifier.\u2019\u201d \nWeyer, 198 F.3d at 1112. Because \u00a7 12111(8) \u201cuses the \npresent tense...one must be able to perform the \nessential functions of employment at the time that one \nis discriminated against.\u201d Id. Section 12111(8)\u2019s other \ntemporal qualifiers reinforce this conclusion. It also \nrefers in the present tense to \u201cthe employment \nposition that such individual holds or desires.\u201d 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8) (emphasis added). The ADA, \ntherefore, has more in common with the provision that \nthis Court limited to current employees in Walters \nthan to the anti-retaliation provision distinguished in \nRobinson.  \n2. \nThe \nspecific \ncontext \nin \nwhich \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d is used within \nthe anti-discrimination provision \nshows \nthat \nit \nprohibits \ndiscrimination solely against those \nwho presently hold or desire jobs.    \nAfter examining the language itself, we next look \nto the \u201cspecific context in which that language is used\u201d \nto discern its meaning. Robinson, 519 U.S. at 341. The \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition is used within the \nanti-discrimination provision. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12112(a), \n12111(8). Petitioner\u2019s incorrect interpretation of Title \nI derives from her narrow focus on the \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d definition completely out of context from \n\n33 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nthe general rule where the definition appears. A \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d means an individual who \u201ccan \nperform the essential functions\u201d of the job she \u201cholds \nor desires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8). Petitioner argues \nthat the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of the \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d definition is to protect employers from \nbeing compelled to hire or retain unqualified \nindividuals by \u201ctesting\u201d an employee's capabilities. \nPet. Br. 34. And so, she argues if an individual has no \njob, an employer has no interest in the individual\u2019s \nability to perform and thus the \u201ccan perform\u201d clause \ncan be ignored. Id. 24, 34-35.  \nThis argument barely holds water when the \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition is read in a vacuum. \nIt completely fails when the definition is read within \nthe general rule where it appears. Indeed, \u201c[t]he \nquestion isn\u2019t just what [qualified individual] mean[s], \nbut what [Title I] says about it.\u201d Bostock, 590 U.S. at \n656. Read in context, the general rule prohibits \ndiscrimination solely against an individual who can \nperform the job she holds or desires. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n12111(8), 12112(a).  \nAnd so, the primary purpose of this anti-\ndiscrimination rule is not to protect the hiring \nprerogatives of employers, but to protect certain \ndisabled individuals from discrimination: those who \npresently work, want to work and can work despite \ntheir disabilities. See Tyndall v. Nat'l Educ. Centers, \nInc. of California, 31 F.3d 209, 215 (4th Cir. 1994) \n(\u201c[T]he primary purpose of the ADA...[is] to encourage \nemployers to take on qualified individuals, regardless \nof their disability.\u201d). Title I was intended to \u201cdraw \nworkers with a disability into the workforce.\u201d Morgan, \n\n34 \n\u0003\n\u0003\n268 F.3d at 458 (emphasis added). Its \u201clanguage [is] \nwell designed to help people get and keep jobs, not to \nhelp those no longer able to work get disability pay.\u201d \nWeyer, 198 F.3d at 1112; see also Pet. App. 8a (the \nADA\u2019s \u201ccentral purpose\u201d is \u201cprotecting disabled people \nwho can nevertheless perform the essential functions \nof a job\u201d). Indeed, drawing the disabled into the \nworkforce would save \u201cthe United States billions of \ndollars in unnecessary expenses resulting from \ndependency and nonproductivity.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n12101(8) (emphasis added).  \nThus, \nthe \nprimary \npurpose \nof \nthe \nanti-\ndiscrimination rule is to prohibit employers from \ndiscriminating \nagainst \ncurrent \nemployees \nand \napplicants who can work despite their disabilities\u2014\nnot to impose a \u201ctest\u201d on employees that they either \n\u201cpass,\u201d \u201cfail,\u201d or in the case of retirees, are allegedly \nexempt from taking. See Pet. Br. 34. By interpreting \nthe definition of a \u201cqualified individual\u201d in a vacuum, \nPetitioner commits the same error as the Second \nCircuit \ndid \nin \nCastellano. \nThere, \ndespite \nacknowledging that it must consider \u201cthe specific \ncontext in which that language is used,\u201d the court \nskipped that step, isolated the definition, and \nconcluded that it failed \u201cto specify when a potential \nplaintiff must have been a \u2018qualified individual with a \ndisability\u2019...\u201d 142 F.3d at 67 (emphasis in original). It \nthen \u201cmanufactured ambiguity where none existed.\u201d \nMcKnight, 550 F.3d at 527.  \nHad the Castellano court read the definition in \ncontext as used in the general rule, it would have \nrealized that the statute says exactly when an \nindividual must be qualified. A violation only arises if \n\n35 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nan employer discriminates against a \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d and thus if one is not qualified at the time \nof the discrimination there is no violation and no \nclaim. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a). By focusing on those who \n\u201ccan perform\u201d jobs they \u201chold or desire\u201d Congress \nlimited the statute\u2019s protections to current employees \nand applicants.  \nEven considering the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of the \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition as narrowly defined \nby Petitioner to protect employers from being forced to \nhire or retain unqualified individuals, Petitioner\u2019s \nargument fails. \u201c[E]xcept in the rare case of an obvious \nscrivener\u2019s error, purpose\u2014even purpose as most \nnarrowly defined\u2014cannot be used to contradict text or \nto supplement it.\u201d A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading \nLaw: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 57 (2012) \n(\u201cScalia & Garner\u201d). Petitioner\u2019s argument that the \npurpose of the \u201ccan perform\u201d clause should be deemed \n\u201csatisfied\u201d in the case of retirees is nothing more than \na request for this Court to rewrite the text to include \nan exception to the \u201ccan perform\u201d clause for retirees.  \nAnd regardless of whether an employer is \nconcerned with a retiree\u2019s ability to perform, Congress \nwas concerned solely with protecting those who \u201ccan \nperform.\u201d If an individual is totally disabled or no \nlonger holds or desires their position, the statute is \nsilent as to discrimination against that individual. \nPetitioner presumes, based on nothing, that the \nstatute must say something about retirees who do not \nhold or desire their jobs. But a \u201cjudge should not \npresume that every statute answers every question, \nthe answers to be discovered through interpretation.\u201d \nScalia & Garner, 93.  \n\n36 \n\u0003\n\u0003\n\u201c[T]he limitations of a text\u2014what a text chooses \nnot to do\u2014are as much a part of its \u2018purposes\u2019 as its \naffirmative dispositions.\u201d Id. at 57 (emphasis in \noriginal). These \u201climitations must be respected, and \nthe only way to accord them their due is to reject the \nreplacement or supplementation of text with purpose.\u201d \nId. at 57-58. Title I expressly limits its protections to \nthose who can perform the jobs they hold or desire. \nThere are no exceptions, and this Court should not \nalter the plain language to make any to appease \nPetitioner\u2019s policy preferences.  \n3. \nTitle \nI\u2019s \ndistinction \nbetween \n\u201cqualified \nindividuals\u201d \nand \n\u201cindividuals\u201d \nis \nconsistent \nthroughout the statutory scheme.   \nThe ADA\u2019s \u201cstatutory scheme is coherent and \nconsistent.\u201d Robinson, 519 U.S. at 340. The ADA\u2019s use \nof \u201cqualified individual\u201d does not vary in different \nprovisions. In Robinson, on the other hand, this Court \nfound that the word \u201cemployee\u201d included former \nemployees in at least some provisions of Title VII. Id. \nat 342-43. Having found \u00a7 704(a) ambiguous, this \nCourt considered what interpretation would be most \nconsistent with that section's purpose. In doing so, this \nCourt emphasized that \u00a7 704(a) was an anti-\nretaliation provision that by its nature would be \n\u201ceffectively vitiate[d]\u201d if it were confined to current \nemployees. Id. at 345. However, the ambiguities and \npolicy concerns that drove this Court\u2019s analysis of Title \nVII\u2019s anti-retaliation provision do not exist under Title \nI of the ADA.  \nTitle I does not protect against retaliation. The \nADA prohibits retaliation under Title V. See 42 U.S.C. \n\n37 \n\u0003\n\u0003\n\u00a7 12203(a) (it is unlawful for any employer \u201cto \ndiscriminate against any individual because such \nindividual has opposed any act or practice made \nunlawful by this chapter...\u201d) (emphasis added). Thus, \nthe concerns that impelled this Court to a broad \nconstruction of Title VII\u2019s anti-retaliation provision \nare not present here, because the ADA's anti-\nretaliation provision is expressly drawn to cover \u201cany \nindividual,\u201d not just the narrower subset of \u201cqualified \nindividuals\u201d covered by Title I. See Morgan, 268 F.3d \nat 458 (\u201cThe difference is stark.\u201d). Thus, when \nCongress wanted to prohibit discrimination against \ndisabled former employees, \u201cit did so clearly and \nexplicitly,\u201d Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U.S. 438, \n455 \n(2002), \nby \nreferring \nto \n\u201cindividuals\u201d\u2014not \n\u201cqualified individuals.\u201d \nB. Petitioner\u2019s contrary arguments lack \nmerit. \nAs described above, the Second and Third Circuits \nare the only circuits to side with Petitioner\u2019s \nargument. See supra Castellano and Ford. Recently, \nhowever, the Second Circuit acknowledged that \u201c[i]n \ngeneral, the determination of whether a person is \n\u2018qualified\u2019 should be made at the time of the \ndiscriminatory employment action,\u201d but in Castellano, \nthe court \u201ccreated a narrow exception to the rule for \npost-employment benefits intended to be used by \nretirees.\u201d Smith v. Town of Ramapo, 745 Fed. Appx. \n424, 426 (2d Cir. 2018) (emphasis added). Thus, even \nthe Second Circuit, albeit in an unpublished opinion, \nadmits that Castellano judicially-created a \u201cnarrow \nexception\u201d to the plain text of the rule articulated by \nCongress. Id.  \n\n38 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nPetitioner now rejects the Second and Third \nCircuit\u2019s finding of ambiguity in the \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d definition. She argues their judgments are \ndictated by the plain text of Title I, which she claims \nimposes only a \u201cconditional\u201d mandate that one be able \nto perform their job only if they hold or desire one. Pet. \nBr. 28. Despite this recasting of the argument, \nPetitioner is still guilty of the same cardinal sin of \nstatutory construction committed by the Second and \nThird Circuits. She too rewrites Title I by creating a \n\u201cnarrow exception\u201d to the \u201ccan perform\u201d clause just for \nretirees.  \n1. \nPetitioner\u2019s interpretation of the \nperformance requirement of the \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition as a \n\u201cconditional \nmandate,\u201d \nadds \nan \nunwritten \nexception \nto \nthat \nrequirement for retirees.    \na. The alleged \u201cconditional\u201d nature of the \nperformance requirement of the \u201cqualified individual\u201d \ndefinition cannot be divined from any part of the \nstatutory text. In support of this theory, Petitioner \nresorts to strained and unnatural constructions such \nas retirees are \u201cnot unable to perform the essential \nfunctions of a job that they hold or desire.\u201d Pet. Br. 34. \nShe admits \u201ctesting the job capabilities of someone \nwho is no longer working may seem logically \nawkward.\u201d Id. That is putting it mildly. But purported \nlogic aside, the text simply does not contain any \nlanguage conditioning the ability to perform on \nwhether a person holds or desires a job.  \nTitle I makes no exceptions to the \u201ccan perform\u201d \nclause. Courts should not \u201celaborate unprovided-for \n\n39 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nexceptions to a text\u2026\u2018[I]f the Congress [had] intended \nto provide...exceptions, it would have done so in clear \nlanguage.\u2019\u201d Scalia & Garner, 93. Petitioner improperly \nargues for a \u201ctacit exception,\u201d Bostock. 590 U.S. at 669, \nto Title I\u2019s \u201ccan perform\u201d clause. But \u201cwhen Congress \nchooses not to include any exceptions to a broad rule, \ncourts apply the broad rule.\u201d Id. \nThe correct reading of Title I to only prohibit \ndiscrimination against an individual who presently \nholds or desires a job that she can perform gives effect \nto all of the words in \u00a7\u00a7 12112(a) and 12111(8). \nPetitioner's interpretation, on the other hand, \nrequires the addition and subtraction of language \nfrom Title I. It does not, however, prohibit \ndiscrimination against an individual who can perform \nthe essential functions of the job only if she holds or \ndesires one. \nEven if Congress wanted to imply that the \nperformance requirement was conditioned upon an \nindividual having or wanting a job, Congress would \nnot have referred to \u201cthe employment position\u201d that \nsuch individual holds or desires. Id. \u00a7 12111(8) \n(emphasis added). By referring to \u201cthe employment \nposition\u201d the text clearly indicates that the job \ncurrently exists. Petitioner\u2019s reading replaces \u201cthe\u201d \nwith \u201can\u201d to read the definition as only requiring the \nability to perform if the individual has an employment \nposition. This addition and subtraction of text cannot \nbe countenanced by this Court.  \nPetitioner argues Congress did not include \u201can\u201d \ninstead of \u201cthe\u201d because that would have made the \nstatute too confusing. Pet. Br. 44. As already \ndiscussed, Congress knew exactly how to expand the \n\n40 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nADA\u2019s protections to other individuals besides current \nemployees and applicants. See supra 36-37. It also \nwould have been a very simple matter for Congress to \ndo what the Second and Third Circuits did to Title I by \ninserting a \u201cnarrow exception\u201d to the \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d definition for retirees. Smith, 745 Fed. \nAppx. at 426. Congress did none of these things and \nPetitioner\u2019s arguments fail.  \nb. \nPetitioner\u2019s \n\u201cconditional \nmandate\u201d \ninterpretation opens the door to a host of new \n\u201cqualified individuals\u201d none of whom Congress \nintended to protect. It will create bizarre incentives for \nemployees to simply deny desiring a job or promotion \nto circumvent the requirement that they be able to \nperform it. An employee totally incapable of \nperforming a certain position could sue if she is not \ngiven the position because of her disability. So long as \nshe doesn\u2019t apply for the promotion or otherwise \nindicate that she \u201cdesires\u201d it, she can sue if a non-\ndisabled employee is given the position over her \ndespite her inability to perform the position because of \nher disability. Petitioner\u2019s \u201cconditional mandate\u201d test \nis unworkable and should be rejected.  \nc. While Petitioner argues that retirees are \n\u201cqualified individuals\u201d who need not satisfy the \u201ccan \nperform\u201d clause, the United States takes a different \napproach that also fails. U.S. Amicus Br. 30. It argues \npost-employment discrimination against a retiree \n\u201cretroactively\u201d changes the terms of employment and \nso \u201cit is naturally described as discrimination against \na qualified individual...even if the plaintiff is no longer \nemployed.\u201d Id. What the United States characterizes \nas a \u201cretroactive change\u201d to the terms of employment \n\n41 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nis actually just a breach of contract. No court would \never describe such a breach as a \u201cretroactive change\u201d \nto a contract. If it did, then all a breaching party would \nhave to do to \u201cretroactively change\u201d the terms of a \ncontract would be to breach it. This, of course, is \nabsurd.  \nAnd whether the changed term of employment is \na contractual term or just a privilege, is irrelevant. \nThere is no time machine that an employer travels in \nto alter the terms or privileges that existed during \nemployment. Those terms and privileges remain the \nsame regardless of any later refusal to honor them. \nTherefore, it is legally unsound to say that a present \nbreach is a past harm to a plaintiff when she was a \n\u201cqualified individual.\u201d A post-employment change only \naffects someone who is unqualified. Moreover, the \nchange happened during Petitioner\u2019s employment in \n2003, but she waived any such claim. So the United \nStates\u2019 argument is purely hypothetical.  \nThe United States primarily argues for reversal \non the grounds Petitioner disclaimed. Its arguments \nfail for all the same reasons described above in Part I. \nIts focus on the alleged discrimination occurring \nduring employment confirms Title I\u2019s purpose to \nprohibit such acts during, not after, employment.  \n \n\n42 \n\u0003\n\u0003\n2. \nPetitioner\u2019s interpretation of the \n\u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d \ndefinition \nsolely \nas \na \nscreen \nto \nprotect \nemployers renders \u00a7\u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A), \n(b)(6), (b)(7), and (d)(2) superfluous. \nPetitioner argues that \u00a7\u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A), (b)(6), \n(b)(7), and (d)(2) allegedly all do the same work as the \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition by allowing employers \nto take actions against disabled employees that \u201care \njustified in relation to the operation of their business.\u201d \nPet. Br. 31. But if these subsections of \u00a7 12112 perform \nthis function, then the same function allegedly \nperformed by \u00a7 12111(8) is rendered superfluous. \nInstead, \u00a7 12111(8) as used in the general rule, tells \nemployers who they may not discriminate against\u2014\nthose who hold or want jobs they can perform\u2014but \nthen \u00a7\u00a7 12112(b) and (d)(2) provide exceptions to that \ngeneral prohibition for the protection of the business.  \nAccordingly, \nPetitioner\u2019s \nreliance \non \nthese \nsubsections undermines her argument and proves the \nCity\u2019s point that the general rule sets forth its limited \nprotection of current employees and applicants who \ncan perform despite their disabilities, but then \u00a7\u00a7 \n12112(b) and (d) include exceptions to that general \nprohibition to allow an employer to discriminate \nagainst these \u201cqualified individuals\u201d where it is \nnecessary to protect the business. \n \n\n43 \n\u0003\n\u0003\n3. \nThe \nEleventh \nCircuit\u2019s \ninterpretation does not render \u00a7 \n12112(b)(5)(A) superfluous.  \nPetitioner argues that if the \u201cqualified individual\u201d \ndefinition excludes those who do not hold or desire a \njob, then \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A)\u2019s reference to an \u201cotherwise \nqualified individual with a disability who is an \napplicant or employee\u201d is surplusage. Pet. Br. 32-33. \nShe is incorrect. \nSection 12112(b) is the \u201cconstruction\u201d provision \nexplaining that the term \u201cdiscriminate against a \nqualified individual on the basis of disability,\u201d \nincludes several forms of discrimination. Section \n12112(b) is replete with references to \u201ca job applicant \nor employee,\u201d sometimes repeating that phrase \nmultiple times within one subsection. See, e.g., \u00a7 \n12112(b)(1). Section 12112(b)(2) also repeats the \nreference to a \u201cqualified applicant or employee\u201d even \nthough it is defining what is included in the term \n\u201cdiscriminate against a qualified individual.\u201d Id. \u00a7 \n12112(b)(2). Likewise, \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(B) refers to a \u201cjob \napplicant or employee who is an otherwise qualified \nindividual with a disability.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(B).  \nThe repetition of these phrases serves only to \nemphasize how important it was to Congress that a \nplaintiff have an actual, present relationship with an \nemployer, as an employee or job applicant, to sue. \nWhile a \u201cqualified individual\u201d may be someone who \nmerely \u201cdesires\u201d a job under \u00a7 12111(8), \u00a7 12112(b) \nclarifies that the individual must actually apply for a \njob to establish a sufficient relationship to the \nemployer to justify imposing obligations on the \nemployer under the ADA. There is no surplusage \n\n44 \n\u0003\n\u0003\ncaused by the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s correct reading of \nTitle I.  \nBut even assuming that the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s \ninterpretation renders the phrase \u201capplicants and \nemployees\u201d in \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A) somehow superfluous, \nthat should not alter the conclusion. \u201cThe canon \nagainst surplusage is not an absolute rule.\u201d Marx v. \nGeneral Revenue Corp., 568 U.S. 371, 385 (2013). \n4. \nPetitioner\u2019s arguments regarding \ncommon usage, grammar and logic \nrely on false analogies.  \nBy focusing on the definition of a \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d in isolation, Petitioner concocts several \nfalse \nanalogies \nin \nsupport \nof \nher \nstrained \ninterpretation. When the definition is read out of \ncontext, it is stripped of its meaning and malleable to \nPetitioner\u2019s many unhelpful hypotheticals. She posits \na movie theater rule: \u201cYou can\u2019t watch the movie \nunless you silence your cell phone.\u201d Pet. Br. 35. She \nstates if you don\u2019t have a phone surely you don\u2019t \nviolate the rule. Id. This rule is not analogous at all to \nTitle I. \nThis rule imposes a prohibition on the patron\u2014\nnot the movie theater. And the prohibition against the \npatron is imposed by the movie theater\u2014not a \nregulator of the movie theater and so the intent behind \nthe rule is not analogous to Title I. When the theater \nis the one imposing the restriction, its intent is to \nprotect other patrons from disruption by noisy cell \nphones. But if a patron does not hold a cell phone, then \nthe theater\u2019s concern is not implicated. So, of course, \nthe theater will let you in if you don\u2019t have a cell \n\n45 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nphone. After all, its motivation is to sell as many \ntickets as possible so long as the ticket holders are not \ndisturbing others.  \nBut a proper analogy to Title I would require a \nhypothetical rule that says, \u201cno movie theater shall \nrefuse entry to an individual who can silence the cell \nphone that such individual holds.\u201d If a patron doesn\u2019t \nhold a cell phone, then under this properly analogous \nrule, the theater can grant the patron entry if it wants, \nbut nothing in the rule prohibits the movie theater \nfrom refusing that patron entry. This is because the \nonly thing that is prohibited by the regulator is refusal \nof entry to people who hold cells phones that can be \nsilenced. The focus, from the regulator\u2019s perspective, \nis clearly on protecting people with cell phones.  \nAt first blush, it may seem strange that this \nfictional regulator did not prohibit discrimination \nagainst people without cell phones, but not once we \nrealize that the regulator enacted the rule with the \nprotection of people with cell phones in mind. Perhaps \nthe regulator was concerned with making sure people \nwith cell phones can still attend movies and did not \nwant theaters to reject them solely because their cell \nphones could disturb others. So long as the cell phone \ncan be silenced, the regulator prohibits movie theaters \nfrom refusing entry to people with cell phones.  \nSimilarly, under Title I, when we realize that \nCongress was concerned only with protecting those \nwho work or want to work, we can see the clear \npurpose of the \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition within \nthe anti-discrimination rule to prohibit discrimination \nsolely against those individuals as long as they can \nperform despite their disabilities. It was not concerned \n\n46 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nwith anyone else in this one statute. It doesn\u2019t mean \nthat employers have a license to discriminate against \nretirees. There are several other laws that would \nprohibit such misconduct. Disabled retirees may face \nchallenges, but Title I \u201cneed not address all aspects of \na problem in one fell swoop; policymakers may focus \non their most pressing concerns.\u201d Williams-Yulee v. \nFlorida Bar, 575 U.S. 433, 449 (2015). \nPetitioner provides other purported analogies all \nsuffering from the same flaw as her movie theater \nhypothetical. Their structure does not mimic Title I\u2019s \nstructure and are thus useless to this Court. For \nexample, her \u201ccommand\u201d analogy fails because \nCongress did not make a command to an employee. \nPet. Br. 39. She argues \u201cWhen a command is \nconditional, its condition may be either overt or \nexplicit.\u201d Id. The command, \u201cDrive carefully!\u201d is \nconditioned on the subject of that command to be in \nthe act of driving. But Congress did not command an \nemployee to \u201cPerform your job!\u201d If it did, then perhaps \nwe could say that an employee must perform only if \nshe has a job. The \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition, \nhowever, does not appear within a command directed \nat an employee. It appears within the anti-\ndiscrimination provision commanding employers not \nto discriminate against individuals who can perform \ntheir jobs.  \nNo matter how many expedient hypotheticals \nPetitioner poses, there is only one way this Court can \nreach her desired outcome\u2014by creating an exception, \njust for retirees, to the plain language prohibiting \ndiscrimination solely against those who can perform \ntheir jobs. \n\n47 \n\u0003\n\u0003\n \n5. \nPetitioner\u2019s \nargument \nthat \nher \ninterpretation is consistent with \nTitle VII and avoids surplusage and \nabsurd consequences, fails. \na. The Eleventh Circuit\u2019s interpretation \ndoes not render the \u201ccompensation\u201d clause of \u00a7 \n12112(a) superfluous. Simply because Title I \nprotects \n\u201ccompensation,\u201d \nincluding \nretirement \nbenefits, does not mean that Title I was designed to \n\u201cprotect \nretirees\u201d \nfrom \npost-employment \ndiscrimination. Pet. Br. 46. The purpose of the \n\u201ccompensation\u201d clause cannot be pursued at the \nexpense of negating Title I\u2019s plain text, especially \nwhen there are numerous circumstances where the \nreference to \u201ccompensation\u201d can be given effect \nwithout \nnullifying \nthe \n\u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d \nlimitations.  \nBecause litigants can sue employers who adopt \ndiscriminatory fringe benefits policies during their \nemployment when they are \u201cqualified individuals,\u201d \neffect can be given to the \u201ccompensation\u201d clause \nwithout \nnegating \nthe \n\u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d \nrequirements. \u201cCompensation\u201d and \u201cfringe benefits\u201d \ncan include a variety of benefits received during \nemployment such as health insurance, vacation pay, \novertime pay, and sick leave. While retirement \nbenefits might be among the items that make up the \nuniverse of compensation or benefits, they are not the \nexclusive or the most important benefit. Because \nemployees who satisfy the plain language of the \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition receive multiple types \nof \u201ccompensation\u201d and \u201cbenefits,\u201d the inclusion of \n\n48 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nthose terms in Title I can be given effect without \nrewriting \u00a7 12111(8). \nThe fact that retirees cannot sue regarding \ndiscriminatory benefits and compensation in every \nscenario does not render Title I\u2019s references to \n\u201ccompensation\u201d superfluous. \u201cNo text pursues its \npurposes at all costs.\u201d Scalia & Garner, 57; Clifford F. \nMacEvoy Co. v. U.S. for Use & Benefit of Calvin \nTomkins Co., 322 U.S. 102, 107 (1944) (even a \u201chighly \nremedial\u201d \nstatute \n\u201centitled \nto \na \nliberal \nconstruction\u2026does not justify ignoring plain words of \nlimitation.\u201d). This \u201cCourt cannot construe a statute in \na way that negates its plain text, and here, Congress \nexpressly limited,\u201d Honeycutt v. United States, 581 \nU.S. 443, 454 n. 2 (2017), Title I\u2019s protections to those \nwho can perform the jobs they hold or desire.  \nb. In the context of a \u201cqualified individual,\u201d \nTitle I and Title VII are not analogous. Petitioner \nargues that her interpretation of Title I would \nmaintain \u201ccongruity between the ADA and Title VII, \nthe statute on which much of title I was \u2018modeled.\u2019\u201d \nPet. Br. 46. While Title I \u201cborrows much of its \nprocedural \nframework \nfrom \n[T]itle \nVII...by \nincorporating title VII's enforcement provisions,\u201d Title \nI \u201cborrows much of its substantive framework from \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.\u201d \nH.R.Rep. No. 101\u2013485(III), at 31 (1990) (emphasis \nadded). The \u201cconcept\u201d of a \u201cqualified individual\u201d who \nmust be able to perform the \u201cessential functions\u201d of her \njob comes from \u201cthe regulations implementing...the \nRehabilitation Act\u201d\u2014not Title VII. Id. at 33. \nThere is no counterpart to the \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d definition in Title VII, so loose references \n\n49 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nto Title VII and the ADA as \u201csibling statutes,\u201d Ford, \n145 F.3d at 606, obscure these important differences \nin the text. Although Title VII and the ADA may be \nclosely related in other respects, on the issue here \u201cthe \nstatutes are not analogous.\u201d Weyer, 198 F.3d at 1111. \nc. Petitioner\u2019s reliance on the absurd results \ntest fails. Petitioner argues there is no plausible \nexplanation for the \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition to \nexclude retirees and she invokes the \u201cabsurd results\u201d \ntest. Pet. Br. 46-47. This \u201cCourt rarely invokes such a \ntest to override unambiguous legislation.\u201d Barnhart, \n534 U.S. at 459. This test is stringent and states \u201cthe \nabsurdity must consist of a disposition that no \nreasonable person could intend.\u201d Scalia & Garner, \n237.  \nHere, there are \u201cseveral explanations for why \nCongress would have purposefully exempted\u201d retirees \nfrom the statute\u2019s coverage. Barnhart, 534 U.S. at 459. \n\u201cCongress could reasonably decide to enable disabled \npeople who can work with reasonable accommodation \nto get and keep jobs, without also deciding to equalize \npost-employment fringe benefits for people who \ncannot work.\u201d Weyer, 198 F.3d at 1112. \u201cCongress has \nthe authority to improve the circumstances of disabled \npeople in some respects even if it does not improve \nthem in all respects.\u201d Id. \u201cLegislation often results \nfrom a delicate compromise among competing \ninterests and concerns.\u201d Id. at 1113; Barnhart, 534 \nU.S. \nat \n461 \n(any \n\u201cdissatisfaction\u201d \nwith \nthe \nconsequences of plain text is \u201coften the cost of \nlegislative compromise.\u201d). \u201cIf we were to \u2018fully \neffectuate\u2019 what we take to be the underlying policy of \nthe legislation, without careful attention to the \n\n50 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nqualifying words in the statute, then we would be \noverturning \nthe \nnuanced \ncompromise \nin \nthe \nlegislation, and substituting our own cruder, less \nresponsive mandate for the law that was actually \npassed.\u201d Weyer, 198 F.3d at 1113. \nTitle I, thus, reasonably prohibits employers from \ndiscriminating solely \u201cagainst people with disabilities \nthat do not prevent job performance, but when a \ndisability renders a person unable to perform the \nessential functions of the job, that disability renders \nhim or her unqualified.\u201d Stevens v. Rite Aid Corp., 851 \nF.3d 224, 229 (2d Cir. 2017). When the perceived gap \nin Title I for the protection of retirees is understood for \nwhat it really is\u2014important compromise that \nfacilitates action on the more pressing problems of the \nday\u2014the consequences of Title I\u2019s plain language are \nnot at all \u201csurprising\u201d or \u201cabsurd.\u201d Pet. Br. 27, 47. \nCongress enacted Title I to provide a legal remedy \nfor disabled workers that did not previously exist. See \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(a)(4). At the time, several other \nfederal statutes existed for the protection of employee \nretirement benefits such as ERISA, the Social \nSecurity Act, and the Medicare Act. The Equal \nProtection Clause provided an additional remedy for \npublic employees. See Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, \n522 (2004) (\u201cemphasiz[ing] that the House and Senate \nCommittee \nReports \non \nthe \nADA \nfocused \non \n\u2018[d]iscrimination [in]...employment in the private \nsector,\u2019 and made no mention of discrimination in \npublic employment.\u201d) (emphasis added by the Court). \nAdditionally, numerous common law claims such as \nbreach of contract, promissory estoppel, or fraud in the \ninducement \nalong \nwith \nstate \nstatutory \nand \n\n51 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nunconstitutional takings claims could be brought to \nobtain promised benefits.  \nThus, before the ADA, a disabled employee could \nnot sue her private employer for discrimination, \nbreach of contract, or any of the other above remedies \nif she accepted a job knowing that her contract \nincluded a lesser pension than a similarly situated \nnon-disabled employee. And even if she didn\u2019t know \nabout a secret discriminatory decision applied to her \nduring her employment but later discovered it, there \nwas no law that prohibited such discrimination. The \nADA stepped in to prohibit such discriminatory \npolicies from being applied to current employees and \napplicants. Such policies could dissuade a disabled job \napplicant from accepting that job or force a disabled \nemployee to search elsewhere for a fair pension. And \nin the absence of the ADA, that employee would be \nforced to do so without remedy. Title I\u2019s \u201clanguage [is] \nwell \ndesigned \nto \nhelp \npeople \nget \nand \nkeep \njobs\u2026\u201dWeyer, 198 F.3d at 1112. \nBut an employer who does not discriminate until \npost-employment does not deter employment. If the \nemployer has a facially neutral pension policy that \npromises a pension to all retirees, but the employer \nwithholds the pension from a disabled retiree, then \nthat retiree has a clear breach of a contract claim \nalong with all of the other remedies mentioned above \nunder ERISA, the Social Security Act, etc. Under \nFlorida law, \u201conce a participating member reaches \nretirement status, the benefits under the terms of the \nact in effect at the time of the employee's retirement \nvest.\u201d Bien, 209 So. 3d at 3. \u201cThe contractual \nrelationship may not thereafter be affected or \n\n52 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nadversely \naltered \nby \nsubsequent \nstatutory \nenactments.\u201d Id. \nThus, the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s interpretation does \nnot \u201callow employers to freely discriminate against \ntheir former employees.\u201d Pet. Br. 47. Employers risk \nsignificant liability for allowing their animus against \nthe disabled to lead them to breach their contracts or \nviolate other laws post-employment. The remedies for \nviolating these laws are not always the same as the \nADA\u2019s remedies. But the fact that these remedies pre-\ndated the ADA demonstrates the reasonableness of \nCongress\u2019 decision to focus on the more pressing issue \nof the day for which there was no remedy at all\u2014\ndiscriminatory \npolicies \nthat \nexcluded \ncapable \nindividuals from the workforce simply because they \nwere disabled. Because there are several plausible \nexplanations for the line drawn by the plain text of \nTitle I, Petitioner\u2019s arguments fail the absurd results \ntest. The Eleventh Circuit correctly held that \nPetitioner could not state a claim for disability \ndiscrimination under the ADA.\u0003\n\u0003\n \n\n53 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nCONCLUSION \nFor these reasons, this Court should affirm.  \n \nRespectfully submitted, \nJESSICA C.

Or a \nuniversity that pays a pension to former employees, but \nnot if they\u2019re Jewish. Such blatant discrimination is \nunquestionably actionable under Title VII of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964. No court would entertain the notion \nthat former employees are barred from challenging these \nodious policies solely because they no longer hold their \njobs. To the contrary, this Court has unanimously held \nthat Title VII\u2019s protections extend to former employees. \nRobinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337 (1997).  \nThe Americans with Disabilities Act is no different. \nCongress explicitly modeled the ADA on Title VII. It \nconferred Title VII\u2019s full \u201cpowers, remedies, and \nprocedures\u201d on ADA plaintiffs, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12117(a), and \nestablished comprehensive \u201ccivil rights protections for \npersons with disabilities that are parallel to\u201d Title VII. \nH.R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 3, at 48 (1990).  \nIn this case, the Eleventh Circuit upended Congress\u2019s \ndesign by holding that a retired firefighter disabled in the \nline of duty may be subjected to discrimination with \nimpunity. That holding is fundamentally mistaken in two \nrespects, each of which independently warrants reversal. \n \nFirst, the court misread what the ADA, as amended \nby the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, says about who may \nsue, what they may sue over, and when they may sue.  \nThe ADA\u2019s enforcement provision tells us who may \nsue: \u201cany person alleging discrimination on the basis of \ndisability in violation of [the Act].\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12117(a). \nThat does not exclude retirees.  \n\n- 2 - \n \nThe statute also tells us what retirees may sue over: \nthe ADA, like Title VII, bans discrimination in \n\u201ccompensation\u201d and \u201cterms, conditions, and privileges of \nemployment\u201d\u2014words this Court has long read to include \npost-employment benefits over which retirees may sue. \nHishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U.S. 69, 77 (1984).  \nAnd, most importantly, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay \nAct clarifies when discrimination occurs and when a \nplaintiff may sue: when a benefits policy is \u201cadopted,\u201d or \nwhen the plaintiff \u201cbecomes subject to\u201d it, or when the \nplaintiff \u201cis affected by\u201d it. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A). \nThe ADA thus prohibits discrimination on the basis of \ndisability in the provision of a benefit earned during a \nplaintiff\u2019s employment\u2014even if the plaintiff does not \nreceive that benefit until she is no longer employed. \nTogether, these provisions\u2014who, what, when\u2014make \nclear that the Eleventh Circuit was wrong to preclude the \npetitioner here from invoking the ADA\u2019s protections. The \nallegedly discriminatory policy at issue was adopted in \n2003, while Lt. Karyn Stanley was still employed and able \nto perform her job as a firefighter and was therefore \nindisputably what the statute calls a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d \nThus, even if she needed to be employed when the alleged \ndiscrimination occurred\u2014as the court below erroneously \nconcluded\u2014she was, and her suit may proceed. \nSecond, the Eleventh Circuit erred in holding that \nretirees are not \u201cqualified individuals\u201d under the ADA. \nA \u201cqualified individual means an individual who, with \nor without reasonable accommodation, can perform the \nessential functions of the employment position that such \nindividual holds or desires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2111(8). The court \nof appeals read this to mean that one must \u201chold or desire\u201d \na job. But that isn\u2019t what the statute says and, at the very \n\n- 3 - \n \nleast, isn\u2019t a reading demanded by the statute\u2019s words or \nsyntax. To see why, try some examples:   \n\u2022 \u201cA \u2018cleared passenger\u2019 means a passenger who can \ncomplete an x-ray screening of the luggage that \nsuch passenger carries or checks. Only \u2018cleared \npassengers\u2019 may board the aircraft.\u201d Can you get \non the plane if you don\u2019t have any bags?  \n\u2022 \u201cYou must silence your cell phone to visit the \nlibrary.\u201d May you visit if you didn\u2019t bring a phone?  \n\u2022 \u201cTo live in this apartment building, you must be \nable to clean up after the pets that you own.\u201d If you \ndon\u2019t own a pet, may you live in the building? \nIn each case, we naturally understand this language to \nmean that certain requirements apply conditionally\u2014only \nif the relevant condition (carrying luggage, bringing a \nphone, owning pets) is met does it trigger an obligation \n(screen bags, silence your phone, clean up). In the pets \nexample, \u201cthat you own\u201d tells us which pets\u2014the ones you \nown. The \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition works the same \nway: It requires you to be able to perform the functions of \na job only to the extent that you \u201chold\u201d or \u201cdesire\u201d one. \nBut nothing in the text requires that you currently \n\u201chold\u201d or \u201cdesire\u201d a job. It would be eccentric to read the \npets rule to mean: \u201cYou must own a pet.\u201d But that\u2019s akin \nto what the court did here. It rewrote the statute to impose \ntwo requirements rather than one: you (a) must hold or \ndesire a job and (b) must be able to perform its functions. \nThis redrafting transforms how the statute works. The \nADA prohibits discrimination \u201cagainst a qualified \nindividual on the basis of disability.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12112(a). The \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition\u2019s role in the statutory \nscheme is to make clear that employers don\u2019t violate that \n\n- 4 - \n \nrule when they make necessary job-related decisions\u2014\ninsisting that a lifeguard be able to swim, for example. The \ndefinition is not there, however, to arbitrarily exclude \nentire categories of people from the Act\u2019s protection.  \nTo be sure, we concede that syntax alone doesn\u2019t \nanswer the question, and that Congress could have been \nclearer. But \u201cin its legal context,\u201d Pulsifer v. United \nStates, 601 U.S. 124, 141 (2024), the definition is best read \nto require that, to the extent that an individual holds a job, \nthey must be able to perform its essential functions. That \nreading aligns with common usage, grammar, and logic, as \nwell as the ADA\u2019s text, structure, and purpose. It \nharmonizes the ADA with Title VII, as Congress \nintended. It avoids unnecessary surplusage. And it avoids \nthe absurd result of leaving retirees unprotected against \neven the most egregious discrimination in the distribution \nof valuable benefits that they earned during their careers.  \nThe consequences of the contrary reading are starkly \nillustrated here. Lt. Stanley served as a firefighter for \nnearly two decades, risking life and limb to protect her \ncommunity. The benefits she seeks to protect were earned \nthrough years of dedicated, dangerous service. Yet under \nthe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s rule, she loses protections that \nwould have safeguarded those benefits\u2014at the moment \nthe protections matter most. This perverse outcome would \npull the rug out from under firefighters, police officers, \nteachers, and others who become disabled through years \nof service to their communities and country.  \nCongress never enacted this arbitrary regime, which \nmakes outright discrimination unlawful up until an \nemployee\u2019s last day of work\u2014and then perfectly lawful \nthe moment she clocks out for the last time. This Court \nshould reverse. \n\n- 5 - \n \nOPINIONS BELOW  \nThe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s opinion is reported at 83 F.4th \n1333 and reproduced at App. 1. The district court\u2019s order \nis unreported but is available at 2021 WL 6333059 and \nreproduced at App. 20. \nJURISDICTIONAL STATEMENT \nThis Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nThe Eleventh Circuit entered judgment on October 11, \n2023. A petition was timely filed on March 8, 2024, and the \nCourt granted certiorari on June 24, 2024. \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED  \nThe relevant provisions of the ADA are reproduced in \na statutory appendix to this brief.  \nSTATEMENT  \nA. \nStatutory background  \n\u201cCongress enacted the ADA in 1990 to remedy \nwidespread discrimination against disabled individuals.\u201d \nPGA Tour, Inc. v. Martin, 532 U.S. 661, 674 (2001). \nCongress found that, \u201chistorically, society has tended to \nisolate and segregate individuals with disabilities,\u201d and \n\u201cdespite some improvements,\u201d that discrimination \n\u201ccontinue[d] to be a serious and pervasive social problem.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(a)(2). It \u201cpersist[ed] in such critical \nareas as employment,\u201d \u201caccess to public services,\u201d and \n\u201cpublic accommodations,\u201d among others. Id. \u00a7 12101(a)(3). \nIn view of those findings, the ADA provides \u201ca clear \nand comprehensive national mandate for the elimination \nof discrimination against individuals with disabilities\u201d with \n\u201cclear, \nstrong, \nconsistent, \nenforceable \nstandards \naddressing discrimination.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12101(b)(1)\u2013(2). And \n\u201c[t]o effectuate its sweeping purpose, the ADA forbids \ndiscrimination against disabled individuals in major areas \n\n- 6 - \n \nof public life,\u201d including, in Title I, employment. Martin, \n532 U.S. at 675. \n1. Title I\u2019s discrimination provision. In keeping with \nthe ADA\u2019s \u201cbroad mandate\u201d and \u201ccomprehensive\u201d \napproach, Martin, 532 U.S. at 675, Title I establishes an \nexpansive approach to what constitutes disability \ndiscrimination in employment. \na. The general rule. Section 12112 sets out a \u201cgeneral \nrule\u201d governing discrimination: \u201c[N]o covered entity shall \ndiscriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of \ndisability in regard to job application procedures, the \nhiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee \ncompensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, \nand privileges of employment.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a). This \nreaches discrimination from before employment begins \n(\u201capplication procedures\u201d and \u201chiring\u201d) through in-role \nperformance \n(\u201cadvancement\u201d) \nto \ntermination \n(\u201cdischarge\u201d) and all the way through to post-employment \nbenefits that \u201caccrue\u201d after \u201ca person\u2019s employment is \ncompleted.\u201d Hishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U.S. 69, 77 \n(1984) (interpreting Title VII). As this Court put it when \ninterpreting identical language in Title VII, \u201c[t]here is no \nquestion\u201d that this prohibition extends to cover \n\u201cretirement benefits.\u201d Ariz. Governing Comm. for Tax \nDeferred Annuity & Deferred Comp. Plans v. Norris, 463 \nU.S. 1073, 1081 (1983) (Marshall, J., joined by Brennan, \nWhite, Stevens, and O\u2019Connor, JJ.). The upshot of this \ncomprehensive list of the \u201cincidents of employment\u201d is \nthat, if something is \u201cpart and parcel of the employment \nrelationship,\u201d the ADA shields it from discrimination. \nHishon, 467 U.S. at 75. \nb. The construction provision. Title I couples the \nreach of its \u201cgeneral rule\u201d with a flexible \u201c[c]onstruction\u201d \nprovision that explains what \u201c\u2018discriminate against a \n\n- 7 - \n \nqualified individual on the basis of disability [in the \ngeneral rule] includes.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b). That \nprovision makes clear that, like all anti-discrimination \nstatutes, Title I prohibits animus-based disparate \ntreatment. See, e.g., id. \u00a7 12112(b)(1). It also reaches \npolicies that have a disparate impact on people with \ndisabilities, specifically singling out \u201cstandards, criteria, \nor methods of administration that have the effect of \ndiscrimination on the basis of disability,\u201d id. \u00a7 \n12112(b)(3)(A), and \u201cstandards\u201d that \u201ctend to screen \nout \u2026 a class of individuals with disabilities,\u201d id. \u00a7 \n12112(b)(6). \nBut, unlike most other anti-discrimination statutes, \nthe ADA doesn\u2019t equate \u201cdiscriminate\u201d with an equal-\ntreatment mandate. Instead, it at times requires \n\u201cpreferential[]\u201d treatment to \u201cachieve [its] basic equal \nopportunity goal.\u201d US Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. \n391, 397 (2002). The \u201cconstruction\u201d provision accomplishes \nthis by defining \u201cdiscriminate\u201d to include the failure to \nprovide a \u201creasonable accommodation.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A). This affirmative mandate can demand \nsignificant changes: \u201cjob restructuring,\u201d \u201cmodified work \nschedules,\u201d \n\u201creassignment,\u201d \nthe \nmodification \nof \nequipment and \u201cfacilities\u201d to make them \u201creadily \naccessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities,\u201d \nand \u201cother similar accommodations.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12111(9). \nc. The \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition. While the \nsweep of the discrimination provision demonstrates the \nADA\u2019s \nplan \nto \naggressively \nroot \nout \ndisability \ndiscrimination in employment, Congress also sought to \nensure that Title I would not \u201cdemand action beyond the \nrealm of the reasonable.\u201d Barnett, 535 U.S. at 401. A \nnumber of its provisions thus balance the Act\u2019s ambitions \nagainst employers\u2019 legitimate interests: The Act requires \n\n- 8 - \n \nonly \u201creasonable\u201d accommodations and carves out \naccommodations that impose \u201cundue hardship\u201d on \nemployers, see, e.g., 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A), and it \nprovides a \u201cbusiness necessity\u201d defense against disparate-\nimpact discrimination stemming from \u201cstandards, tests, \nor selection criteria,\u201d id. \u00a7 12113(a). \nChief among these provisions is the general rule\u2019s \nprohibition \nof \ndiscrimination \nagainst \n\u201cqualified \nindividuals.\u201d A \u201cqualified individual\u201d is defined as \u201can \nindividual \nwho, \nwith \nor \nwithout \nreasonable \naccommodation, can perform the essential functions of the \nemployment position that such individual holds or \ndesires.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12111(8). The role of this definition\u2014and its \nplacement in the general rule\u2014is to \u201creaffirm\u201d that Title \nI \u201cdoes not undermine an employer\u2019s ability to choose and \nmaintain qualified workers.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 2, \nat 55 (1990). An employer, for instance, may refuse to hire \nsomeone whose disability prevents them (even with the \nbenefit of an accommodation) from \u201clift[ing] fifty pounds\u201d \nif doing so is necessary for performing the job. H.R. Rep. \nNo. 101-485, at 56.

Or a \nuniversity that pays a pension to former employees, but \nnot if they\u2019re Jewish. Such blatant discrimination is \nunquestionably actionable under Title VII of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964. No court would entertain the notion \nthat former employees are barred from challenging these \nodious policies solely because they no longer hold their \njobs. To the contrary, this Court has unanimously held \nthat Title VII\u2019s protections extend to former employees. \nRobinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337 (1997).  \nThe Americans with Disabilities Act is no different. \nCongress explicitly modeled the ADA on Title VII. It \nconferred Title VII\u2019s full \u201cpowers, remedies, and \nprocedures\u201d on ADA plaintiffs, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12117(a), and \nestablished comprehensive \u201ccivil rights protections for \npersons with disabilities that are parallel to\u201d Title VII. \nH.R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 3, at 48 (1990).  \nIn this case, the Eleventh Circuit upended Congress\u2019s \ndesign by holding that a retired firefighter disabled in the \nline of duty may be subjected to discrimination with \nimpunity. That holding is fundamentally mistaken in two \nrespects, each of which independently warrants reversal. \n \nFirst, the court misread what the ADA, as amended \nby the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, says about who may \nsue, what they may sue over, and when they may sue.  \nThe ADA\u2019s enforcement provision tells us who may \nsue: \u201cany person alleging discrimination on the basis of \ndisability in violation of [the Act].\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12117(a). \nThat does not exclude retirees.  \n\n- 2 - \n \nThe statute also tells us what retirees may sue over: \nthe ADA, like Title VII, bans discrimination in \n\u201ccompensation\u201d and \u201cterms, conditions, and privileges of \nemployment\u201d\u2014words this Court has long read to include \npost-employment benefits over which retirees may sue. \nHishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U.S. 69, 77 (1984).  \nAnd, most importantly, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay \nAct clarifies when discrimination occurs and when a \nplaintiff may sue: when a benefits policy is \u201cadopted,\u201d or \nwhen the plaintiff \u201cbecomes subject to\u201d it, or when the \nplaintiff \u201cis affected by\u201d it. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A). \nThe ADA thus prohibits discrimination on the basis of \ndisability in the provision of a benefit earned during a \nplaintiff\u2019s employment\u2014even if the plaintiff does not \nreceive that benefit until she is no longer employed. \nTogether, these provisions\u2014who, what, when\u2014make \nclear that the Eleventh Circuit was wrong to preclude the \npetitioner here from invoking the ADA\u2019s protections. The \nallegedly discriminatory policy at issue was adopted in \n2003, while Lt. Karyn Stanley was still employed and able \nto perform her job as a firefighter and was therefore \nindisputably what the statute calls a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d \nThus, even if she needed to be employed when the alleged \ndiscrimination occurred\u2014as the court below erroneously \nconcluded\u2014she was, and her suit may proceed. \nSecond, the Eleventh Circuit erred in holding that \nretirees are not \u201cqualified individuals\u201d under the ADA. \nA \u201cqualified individual means an individual who, with \nor without reasonable accommodation, can perform the \nessential functions of the employment position that such \nindividual holds or desires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2111(8). The court \nof appeals read this to mean that one must \u201chold or desire\u201d \na job. But that isn\u2019t what the statute says and, at the very \n\n- 3 - \n \nleast, isn\u2019t a reading demanded by the statute\u2019s words or \nsyntax. To see why, try some examples:   \n\u2022 \u201cA \u2018cleared passenger\u2019 means a passenger who can \ncomplete an x-ray screening of the luggage that \nsuch passenger carries or checks. Only \u2018cleared \npassengers\u2019 may board the aircraft.\u201d Can you get \non the plane if you don\u2019t have any bags?  \n\u2022 \u201cYou must silence your cell phone to visit the \nlibrary.\u201d May you visit if you didn\u2019t bring a phone?  \n\u2022 \u201cTo live in this apartment building, you must be \nable to clean up after the pets that you own.\u201d If you \ndon\u2019t own a pet, may you live in the building? \nIn each case, we naturally understand this language to \nmean that certain requirements apply conditionally\u2014only \nif the relevant condition (carrying luggage, bringing a \nphone, owning pets) is met does it trigger an obligation \n(screen bags, silence your phone, clean up). In the pets \nexample, \u201cthat you own\u201d tells us which pets\u2014the ones you \nown. The \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition works the same \nway: It requires you to be able to perform the functions of \na job only to the extent that you \u201chold\u201d or \u201cdesire\u201d one. \nBut nothing in the text requires that you currently \n\u201chold\u201d or \u201cdesire\u201d a job. It would be eccentric to read the \npets rule to mean: \u201cYou must own a pet.\u201d But that\u2019s akin \nto what the court did here. It rewrote the statute to impose \ntwo requirements rather than one: you (a) must hold or \ndesire a job and (b) must be able to perform its functions. \nThis redrafting transforms how the statute works. The \nADA prohibits discrimination \u201cagainst a qualified \nindividual on the basis of disability.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12112(a). The \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition\u2019s role in the statutory \nscheme is to make clear that employers don\u2019t violate that \n\n- 4 - \n \nrule when they make necessary job-related decisions\u2014\ninsisting that a lifeguard be able to swim, for example. The \ndefinition is not there, however, to arbitrarily exclude \nentire categories of people from the Act\u2019s protection.  \nTo be sure, we concede that syntax alone doesn\u2019t \nanswer the question, and that Congress could have been \nclearer. But \u201cin its legal context,\u201d Pulsifer v. United \nStates, 601 U.S. 124, 141 (2024), the definition is best read \nto require that, to the extent that an individual holds a job, \nthey must be able to perform its essential functions. That \nreading aligns with common usage, grammar, and logic, as \nwell as the ADA\u2019s text, structure, and purpose. It \nharmonizes the ADA with Title VII, as Congress \nintended. It avoids unnecessary surplusage. And it avoids \nthe absurd result of leaving retirees unprotected against \neven the most egregious discrimination in the distribution \nof valuable benefits that they earned during their careers.  \nThe consequences of the contrary reading are starkly \nillustrated here. Lt. Stanley served as a firefighter for \nnearly two decades, risking life and limb to protect her \ncommunity. The benefits she seeks to protect were earned \nthrough years of dedicated, dangerous service. Yet under \nthe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s rule, she loses protections that \nwould have safeguarded those benefits\u2014at the moment \nthe protections matter most. This perverse outcome would \npull the rug out from under firefighters, police officers, \nteachers, and others who become disabled through years \nof service to their communities and country.  \nCongress never enacted this arbitrary regime, which \nmakes outright discrimination unlawful up until an \nemployee\u2019s last day of work\u2014and then perfectly lawful \nthe moment she clocks out for the last time. This Court \nshould reverse. \n\n- 5 - \n \nOPINIONS BELOW  \nThe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s opinion is reported at 83 F.4th \n1333 and reproduced at App. 1. The district court\u2019s order \nis unreported but is available at 2021 WL 6333059 and \nreproduced at App. 20. \nJURISDICTIONAL STATEMENT \nThis Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nThe Eleventh Circuit entered judgment on October 11, \n2023. A petition was timely filed on March 8, 2024, and the \nCourt granted certiorari on June 24, 2024. \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED  \nThe relevant provisions of the ADA are reproduced in \na statutory appendix to this brief.  \nSTATEMENT  \nA. \nStatutory background  \n\u201cCongress enacted the ADA in 1990 to remedy \nwidespread discrimination against disabled individuals.\u201d \nPGA Tour, Inc. v. Martin, 532 U.S. 661, 674 (2001). \nCongress found that, \u201chistorically, society has tended to \nisolate and segregate individuals with disabilities,\u201d and \n\u201cdespite some improvements,\u201d that discrimination \n\u201ccontinue[d] to be a serious and pervasive social problem.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(a)(2). It \u201cpersist[ed] in such critical \nareas as employment,\u201d \u201caccess to public services,\u201d and \n\u201cpublic accommodations,\u201d among others. Id. \u00a7 12101(a)(3). \nIn view of those findings, the ADA provides \u201ca clear \nand comprehensive national mandate for the elimination \nof discrimination against individuals with disabilities\u201d with \n\u201cclear, \nstrong, \nconsistent, \nenforceable \nstandards \naddressing discrimination.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12101(b)(1)\u2013(2). And \n\u201c[t]o effectuate its sweeping purpose, the ADA forbids \ndiscrimination against disabled individuals in major areas \n\n- 6 - \n \nof public life,\u201d including, in Title I, employment. Martin, \n532 U.S. at 675. \n1. Title I\u2019s discrimination provision. In keeping with \nthe ADA\u2019s \u201cbroad mandate\u201d and \u201ccomprehensive\u201d \napproach, Martin, 532 U.S. at 675, Title I establishes an \nexpansive approach to what constitutes disability \ndiscrimination in employment. \na. The general rule. Section 12112 sets out a \u201cgeneral \nrule\u201d governing discrimination: \u201c[N]o covered entity shall \ndiscriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of \ndisability in regard to job application procedures, the \nhiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee \ncompensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, \nand privileges of employment.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a). This \nreaches discrimination from before employment begins \n(\u201capplication procedures\u201d and \u201chiring\u201d) through in-role \nperformance \n(\u201cadvancement\u201d) \nto \ntermination \n(\u201cdischarge\u201d) and all the way through to post-employment \nbenefits that \u201caccrue\u201d after \u201ca person\u2019s employment is \ncompleted.\u201d Hishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U.S. 69, 77 \n(1984) (interpreting Title VII). As this Court put it when \ninterpreting identical language in Title VII, \u201c[t]here is no \nquestion\u201d that this prohibition extends to cover \n\u201cretirement benefits.\u201d Ariz. Governing Comm. for Tax \nDeferred Annuity & Deferred Comp. Plans v. Norris, 463 \nU.S. 1073, 1081 (1983) (Marshall, J., joined by Brennan, \nWhite, Stevens, and O\u2019Connor, JJ.). The upshot of this \ncomprehensive list of the \u201cincidents of employment\u201d is \nthat, if something is \u201cpart and parcel of the employment \nrelationship,\u201d the ADA shields it from discrimination. \nHishon, 467 U.S. at 75. \nb. The construction provision. Title I couples the \nreach of its \u201cgeneral rule\u201d with a flexible \u201c[c]onstruction\u201d \nprovision that explains what \u201c\u2018discriminate against a \n\n- 7 - \n \nqualified individual on the basis of disability [in the \ngeneral rule] includes.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b). That \nprovision makes clear that, like all anti-discrimination \nstatutes, Title I prohibits animus-based disparate \ntreatment. See, e.g., id. \u00a7 12112(b)(1). It also reaches \npolicies that have a disparate impact on people with \ndisabilities, specifically singling out \u201cstandards, criteria, \nor methods of administration that have the effect of \ndiscrimination on the basis of disability,\u201d id. \u00a7 \n12112(b)(3)(A), and \u201cstandards\u201d that \u201ctend to screen \nout \u2026 a class of individuals with disabilities,\u201d id. \u00a7 \n12112(b)(6). \nBut, unlike most other anti-discrimination statutes, \nthe ADA doesn\u2019t equate \u201cdiscriminate\u201d with an equal-\ntreatment mandate. Instead, it at times requires \n\u201cpreferential[]\u201d treatment to \u201cachieve [its] basic equal \nopportunity goal.\u201d US Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. \n391, 397 (2002). The \u201cconstruction\u201d provision accomplishes \nthis by defining \u201cdiscriminate\u201d to include the failure to \nprovide a \u201creasonable accommodation.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A). This affirmative mandate can demand \nsignificant changes: \u201cjob restructuring,\u201d \u201cmodified work \nschedules,\u201d \n\u201creassignment,\u201d \nthe \nmodification \nof \nequipment and \u201cfacilities\u201d to make them \u201creadily \naccessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities,\u201d \nand \u201cother similar accommodations.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12111(9). \nc. The \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition. While the \nsweep of the discrimination provision demonstrates the \nADA\u2019s \nplan \nto \naggressively \nroot \nout \ndisability \ndiscrimination in employment, Congress also sought to \nensure that Title I would not \u201cdemand action beyond the \nrealm of the reasonable.\u201d Barnett, 535 U.S. at 401. A \nnumber of its provisions thus balance the Act\u2019s ambitions \nagainst employers\u2019 legitimate interests: The Act requires \n\n- 8 - \n \nonly \u201creasonable\u201d accommodations and carves out \naccommodations that impose \u201cundue hardship\u201d on \nemployers, see, e.g., 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A), and it \nprovides a \u201cbusiness necessity\u201d defense against disparate-\nimpact discrimination stemming from \u201cstandards, tests, \nor selection criteria,\u201d id. \u00a7 12113(a). \nChief among these provisions is the general rule\u2019s \nprohibition \nof \ndiscrimination \nagainst \n\u201cqualified \nindividuals.\u201d A \u201cqualified individual\u201d is defined as \u201can \nindividual \nwho, \nwith \nor \nwithout \nreasonable \naccommodation, can perform the essential functions of the \nemployment position that such individual holds or \ndesires.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12111(8). The role of this definition\u2014and its \nplacement in the general rule\u2014is to \u201creaffirm\u201d that Title \nI \u201cdoes not undermine an employer\u2019s ability to choose and \nmaintain qualified workers.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 2, \nat 55 (1990). An employer, for instance, may refuse to hire \nsomeone whose disability prevents them (even with the \nbenefit of an accommodation) from \u201clift[ing] fifty pounds\u201d \nif doing so is necessary for performing the job. H.R. Rep. \nNo. 101-485, at 56. Title I thus allows employers cabined \nauthority to act on the basis of disability; they may do so \nonly to ensure that the people they hire can perform the \ncore, or \u201cessential,\u201d functions of the job at issue\u2014a limited \nrole that the definition of \u201cqualified individual\u201d \nunderscores by requiring deference to the \u201cemployer\u2019s \njudgment as to what functions of a job are essential,\u201d but \nnothing more. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8). \n2. Title I\u2019s enforcement provision. To vindicate its \nsubstantive prohibition on disability-based discrimination, \nTitle I adopted what was, by the time the ADA became \nlaw, a proven remedial mechanism. Section 12117, entitled \n\u201cEnforcement,\u201d provides that the \u201cpowers, remedies, and \nprocedures\u201d available under Title VII may be invoked by \n\n- 9 - \n \n\u201cany person alleging discrimination on the basis of \ndisability in violation of\u201d Title I. Id. \u00a7 12117(a). Even \nbefore the ADA was enacted, retirees had used those \nremedies and procedures to enforce their rights under \nTitle VII with respect to post-employment benefits. See, \ne.g., Florida v. Long, 487 U.S. 223, 225 (1988); Norris, 463 \nU.S. at 1074; City of Los Angeles, Dep\u2019t of Water & Power \nv. Manhart, 435 U.S. 702, 704 (1978).  \n3. The Fair Pay Act. Title VII\u2019s enforcement \nmechanism has since been expanded through the Lilly \nLedbetter Fair Pay Act. See Pub. L. No. 111-2, \u00a7 3, \n123 Stat. 5 (2009). That Act clarifies that an unlawful \nemployment practice \u201coccurs\u201d\u2014and thus restarts the \ntime to sue\u2014when:  \n(1) the \u201cdiscriminatory compensation decision or \nother practice is adopted,\u201d  \n(2) the person is \u201csubject to a discriminatory \ncompensation decision,\u201d or  \n(3) \u201cwhen an individual is affected by application of \na discriminatory compensation decision or other \npractice, including each time wages, benefits, or \nother compensation is paid.\u201d  \nId. \n\u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A). \nThis \nmeans \nthat \n\u201cevery \ndiscriminatory paycheck or other compensation resulting, \nin whole or in part, from an earlier discriminatory pay \ndecision or other practice\u201d is another occurrence for which \na person can seek redress. See H.R Rep. No. 110-237, at 3 \n(2007). \nB. \nFactual background \nIn 1999, after serving in the military, Karyn Stanley \nbegan her career as a firefighter for the City of Sanford, \nFlorida. Pet. App. 2a. In 2005, she was promoted to Fire \n\n- 10 - \n \nLieutenant. All told, Lt. Stanley served the City for almost \ntwo decades as a firefighter. Doc. 1 at 3.  \nWhen the City offered her the job, her employment \npackage included a \u201chealth insurance subsidy.\u201d Pet. App. \n3a. This benefit covered most of the cost of participating \nin the City\u2019s health-insurance plan. Id.; Doc. 1 at 5. So \nalthough Lt. Stanley\u2019s monthly health-insurance premium \nunder the City\u2019s health plan was approximately $1,300, the \nCity\u2019s subsidy covered $1,000 of that cost, requiring her to \npay only $300. The City told her that this benefit applied \nboth to current employees and to qualifying retirees until \nthey reached age sixty-five. Doc. 38-15 at 11. A retiree was \neligible regardless of whether she \u201cretire[d] with twenty-\nfive (25) years of service\u201d or \u201cretire[d] for disability \nreasons.\u201d Doc. 38-6 at 2; Pet. App. 21a.  \nThis health-insurance subsidy was an especially \nimportant benefit for firefighters like Lt. Stanley because \nthey have one of the \u201chighest rates of injuries and illnesses \nof all occupations.\u201d Bureau of Lab. Stats., Occupational \nOutlook Handbook, Firefighters, https://perma.cc/F8CP-\nUJL8. Indeed, for many critical public-service jobs that \ncome with lower salaries, post-employment benefits are a \nmajor draw for potential employees, representing an \nimportant part of the compensation for which they \nundertake (and stay in) their roles as police officers, \nfirefighters, or other first responders. See Bureau of Lab. \nStats., Employee Benefits, https://perma.cc/PLP6-7GHL. \nIn 2003, unbeknownst to Lt. Stanley, the City quietly \nchanged its subsidy policy to distinguish between \n\u201cdisabled\u201d and \u201cnormal\u201d retirees. Doc. 1 at 12. The new \npolicy changed the benefits eligibility for \u201call employees \nretiring as a result of full disability\u201d so that it would run \nonly \u201cuntil the disabled retiree receives Medicare benefits \n\n- 11 - \n \nor until 24 months have elapsed from the date of \nretirement, whichever comes first.\u201d Pet. App. 22a; Doc. \n38-11 at 4. By contrast, \u201cnormal retirees\u201d remained \neligible until age sixty-five. Doc. 39-16 at 13. So if a \nfirefighter is injured in the line of duty or develops a \ncareer-ending illness one year before she completes her \ntwenty-five years of service, the subsidy lasts for only \ntwenty-four months. \nThe City claimed that the new policy was a necessary \n\u201ccost cutting measure[].\u201d Doc. 38 at 7. But it never offered \nany justification for cutting costs associated with disabled \nemployees alone. The City\u2019s HR director had no \nexplanation, Doc. 39-4 at 10, 13\u201314, and it was unable to \nidentify any \u201cdata, mathematical calculations, [or] \ncorrespondence \u2026 upon which [it] based its decision\u201d to \nrescind benefits from disabled retirees and not \u201cnormal \nretirees.\u201d Doc. 39-16 at 5, 40. Indeed, city employees could \nnot even point to any \u201cfinancial estimates\u201d of \u201cthe cost of \ncontinuing the disability retirees[\u2019] [subsidy] longer than \n24 months\u201d before enacting the policy. Doc. 39-9 at 46. \nWhatever the reason for the change, the new policy \ndecimated Lt. Stanley\u2019s promised retirement benefits \nbecause her career as a firefighter was cut short by \nParkinson\u2019s disease. After nearly twenty years of service, \nLt. Stanley began to develop \u201cstiffness [and] rigidity \u2026 as \nwell as [a] loss of dexterity in her extremities.\u201d Doc. 38-4 \nat 3. In 2016, she was officially diagnosed with \nParkinson\u2019s. Pet. App. 2a. For a longtime firefighter like \nLt. Stanley, that diagnosis was tragic but not surprising. \nSome states have adopted a legal presumption that \nfirefighters who develop Parkinson\u2019s did so in the line of \nduty based on the frequency with which the disease afflicts \n\n- 12 - \n \nfirefighters. See N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law \u00a7 207-kkk (Consol.); \nInd. Code Ann. \u00a7 5-10-15-5.5.  \nFor two years after her diagnosis, Lt. Stanley \ncontinued to work as a lieutenant. Pet. App. 2a. But \neventually it became clear that Lt. Stanley\u2019s disability was \npreventing her from meeting the physical demands of her \njob. Pet. App. 2a. In 2018, at the age of forty-seven, Lt. \nStanley took disability retirement with the City\u2019s \nagreement. Pet. App. 2a. \nAt that point, Lt. Stanley expected the employer she \nhad served for almost twenty years to stand by the \nbargain that it had struck with her when she was hired. \nThe City had explained her original benefits package \nwhen she first joined, and it had never told her about any \nchange in policy. Doc. 38-15 at 9. She had never received \nan updated human resources manual explaining that she \nwould no longer receive the retirement benefits she was \nexpecting. Doc. 38-15 at 9, 11. But just twenty-four months \nafter she retired, the City discontinued Lt. Stanley\u2019s \nhealth-insurance \nsubsidy, \nleaving \nher \nfinancially \nresponsible for all of her health insurance. Pet. App. 3a.  \nFor the past few years, Lt. Stanley has paid out of \npocket for the entire cost of the City\u2019s health-insurance \npolicy, which she relies on for her Parkinson\u2019s treatment. \nDoc 39-9 at 23; Doc. 38-15 at 11, 21. The cost to Lt. Stanley \nof covering the $1,000 monthly subsidy until she is sixty-\nfive\u2014if she is even able to do so\u2014would be more than \n$150,000. Doc. 1 at 6\u20137. Due to the high cost of the City\u2019s \nhealth-insurance premium without the subsidy, no other \ndisabled retirees have been able to stay on the City\u2019s \ninsurance after the loss of the subsidy. Doc. 39-9 at 25; see \nDoc. 39-16 at 3\u20134. Non-disabled retirees, however, \n\n- 13 - \n \ntypically remain on the City\u2019s health insurance until they \nbecome eligible for Medicare. Doc. 39-4 at 69. \nC. Procedural background \nLt. Stanley filed this lawsuit alleging that the City\u2019s \npolicy violated the ADA. Pet. App. 24a. The district court \ndismissed Lt. Stanley\u2019s Title I claim. The court found itself \nbound by circuit precedent holding that a \u201cdisabled \nformer employee\u201d like Lt. Stanley has \u201cno standing to \nsue\u201d over post-employment benefits under Title I because \nshe is \u201cno longer\u201d a qualified individual. Pet. App. 24a. \nThe Eleventh Circuit affirmed. It held that Lt. \nStanley, as a former employee, could not sue about \ndiscrimination in her benefits under the ADA because she \nwas not a \u201cqualified individual\u201d at the time that the City \nterminated her subsidy payments in 2020. Pet. App. 11a\u2013\n12a. The court emphasized that section 12111(8) defines \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d using the \u201cpresent tense\u201d words \n\u201c[c]an,\u201d \u201cholds,\u201d and \u201cdesires.\u201d Pet. App. 11a. Thus, it \nheld, a plaintiff \u201cmust desire or already have a job with the \ndefendant at the time the defendant commits the \ndiscriminatory act.\u201d Id. And since Lt. Stanley was a \n\u201cretiree, not [an] employee,\u201d in 2020, she was not a \n\u201cqualified individual.\u201d Pet. App. 16a. \nThe panel further concluded that Lt. Stanley was not \na \u201cqualified individual\u201d at any other discrete moment in \nwhich discrimination could have occurred. Pet. App. 16a\u2013\n17a. The court announced that Lt. Stanley \u201cconcede[d]\u201d \nthat the City\u2019s change of the policy in 2003 could not \namount to actionable discrimination. Pet. App. 16a. And it \n\u201cagree[d]\u201d with Lt. Stanley\u2019s (alleged) concession that her \nclaim could not turn on the 2003 policy change because she \nwas \u201cnot yet disabled at that time.\u201d Id. Nor, the court \nreasoned, could Lt. Stanley\u2019s claim turn on the City\u2019s \n\n- 14 - \n \nactions in the period after she was diagnosed with \nParkinson\u2019s but before she retired because she (allegedly \nalso) \u201cconceded that \u2026 she was [not] impacted\u201d until after \nshe retired. Pet. App. 18a.  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI. The ADA permits former employees to sue over \npost-employment benefits.  \nThe who: The ADA\u2019s enforcement provision allows suit \nby \u201cany person alleging discrimination\u201d in violation of the \nAct who \u201cclaim[s] to be aggrieved.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12117(a), \n2000e-5(f)(1). This language doesn\u2019t limit suits to \n\u201cemployees,\u201d \u201capplicants,\u201d or \u201cqualified individuals.\u201d  \nThe what: The ADA targets discrimination not just in \nhiring \nand \nfiring \nbut \nalso \nin \n\u201cemployee \ncompensation \u2026 and \nother \nterms, \nconditions, \nand \nprivileges of employment.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12112(a). By the time the \nADA was enacted in 1990, this Court had already \ninterpreted Title VII\u2019s parallel language as protecting \nretirement benefits.  \nThe when: The Fair Pay Act further clarifies that \nretirees may bring suit under the ADA when they are \n\u201caffected by application of\u201d discriminatory benefits plans \n\u201cadopted\u201d while they were working. Id. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A). \nThis allows a plaintiff to challenge a decision to adopt a \ndiscriminatory benefits policy each time that she is \nadversely affected, even after her employment ends. So \neven if Ms. Stanley didn\u2019t feel the effects of the City\u2019s \npolicy until she retired, these provisions together make \nclear that her claim may proceed.  \nII. The court of appeals independently erred in holding \nthat the ADA protects only those who \u201chold[] or desire[]\u201d \na job. Nothing in the ADA\u2019s text requires that result, \n\n- 15 - \n \nwhich would leave retirees unprotected against even the \nmost egregious discrimination. \nThe ADA doesn\u2019t require a person to \u201chold[] or \ndesire[]\u201d a job to be a qualified individual. The definition \nasks if an individual \u201ccan perform the essential functions \nof the employment position that such individual holds or \ndesires.\u201d In other words, it tests if you can do a job, not if \nyou have or want one.  \nThis makes sense given the definition\u2019s role in the \nstatutory scheme: It affords employers necessary, but \ncircumscribed, flexibility to restrict employment on the \nbasis of disability to preserve the functioning of a \nbusiness. It allows employers to screen out people who \ncan\u2019t perform core job functions, not to implement \ndiscriminatory policies unrelated to job performance.  \nThis understanding avoids treating key statutory \nterms \nas \nsurplusage. \nThe \nADA\u2019s \nreasonable-\naccommodation provision applies to a \u201cqualified individual \nwith a disability who is an applicant or employee.\u201d Id. \n\u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A) (emphasis added). This tells us that the \nAct contemplates at least some qualified individuals who \nare neither applicants nor employees\u2014a category that \nwould not exist under the court of appeals\u2019 reading. \nCommon usage, grammar, and logic all show that the \ntext doesn\u2019t demand the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s reading. \nConsider this rule: \u201cAn individual may not watch the \nmovie unless the individual silences the electronic devices \nthat such individual carries.\u201d If you come to the theater \nwithout a device, can you stay? Of course. The rule \nrequires patrons to turn off their devices only to the extent \nthat they have them. The \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition \nworks the same way: It requires individuals to be able to \nperform essential job functions only to the extent they \nhold or desire jobs with such functions.  \n\n- 16 - \n \nEven granting that the \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition \ncould be read in a vacuum to support the Eleventh \nCircuit\u2019s view, ours is the better reading in the context of \nthe statute as a whole. Treating retirees as \u201cqualified \nindividuals\u201d allows the definition to fulfill its role in \nscreening out those who can\u2019t perform job functions, \nwithout turning it into an arbitrary license to discriminate. \nIt avoids rendering key language superfluous. It gives \nforce to the ADA\u2019s protections for retirement benefits. \nAnd it maintains congruity between the ADA and Title \nVII. In short, it is the reading that is far \u201cmore consistent \nwith the broader context of\u201d the Act and the \u201cprimary \npurpose\u201d of the definition. Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., \n519 U.S. 337, 346 (1997).  \nARGUMENT \n \nBy allowing employers to discriminate against \ndisabled retirees with impunity\u2014in ways that would never \nbe tolerated for race, religion, sex, or national origin\u2014the \nEleventh Circuit\u2019s decision frustrates Congress\u2019s plan for \na \u201ccomprehensive national mandate for the elimination of \ndiscrimination against individuals with disabilities.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(b)(1). The decision is flawed in two key \nrespects, each of which independently warrants reversal:  \n \nFirst, it fundamentally misunderstands the ADA\u2019s \ntext and structure. The ADA allows \u201cany person alleging \ndiscrimination\u201d to sue, including retirees who are later \n\u201caffected by the application of\u201d discriminatory policies \nthat were \u201cadopted\u201d while they were working. That \ndescription fits the allegations in this case to a T.  \n \nSecond, it misreads the ADA\u2019s \u201cqualified individual\u201d \ndefinition as excluding retirees from the Act\u2019s protection. \nThe text doesn\u2019t compel that reading, and an \u201cinquiry into \ntext and context\u201d makes the statute\u2019s contrary meaning \n\n- 17 - \n \nclear. Pulsifer v. United States, 601 U.S. 124, 141 (2024). \nReading the ADA to protect retirees makes sense of the \nscheme as a whole, harmonizes Title VII and the ADA, \navoids turning key provisions into surplusage, and escapes \nan outcome that puts the statute \u201cat war with itself.\u201d Groff \nv. DeJoy, 600 U.S. 447, 472 (2023). \nI. \nThe ADA permits former employees to bring suit \nwith respect to post-employment benefits. \nThe ADA permits retirees to sue over their benefits. \nThis conclusion follows from the ADA\u2019s enforcement \nprovision, its coverage of post-employment benefits, and \nthe Fair Pay Act\u2019s clarification of when plaintiffs may sue \nover benefits. Together they make clear that Lt. Stanley\u2019s \nsuit, which challenges a policy \u201cadopted\u201d while she was \nemployed, and to which she was \u201csubjected\u201d while \nworking for the City, may proceed. This Court therefore \nneed not even reach the court of appeals\u2019 erroneous \nholding that the Act only prohibits discrimination against \npeople who currently \u201chold[] or desire[]\u201d a job.  \nA. The who: The ADA\u2019s enforcement provision \nallows suit by \u201cany person alleging \ndiscrimination\u201d in violation of the Act. \nTo enforce the ADA\u2019s \u201cbroad mandate,\u201d Martin, \n532 U.S. at 674\u201375, section 12117, titled \u201cEnforcement,\u201d \nprovides \u201cto any person alleging discrimination on the \nbasis of disability in violation of\u201d Title I the full range of \nremedies provided for in Title VII. 42 U.S.C \u00a7 12117(a). \nNoticeably absent from this authority to sue is a \nrequirement that the plaintiff be a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d \nInstead, \u201cany person\u201d who alleges a discriminatory act in \nviolation of the statute can invoke Title VII\u2019s remedial \nframework. And that framework contains no relevant \nlimitation either: It allows any \u201cperson claiming to be \n\n- 18 - \n \naggrieved\u201d to bring a \u201ccivil action.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-\n5(f)(1).  \nDespite its breadth, Title VII\u2019s remedial provision \ndoes have its limits: Only plaintiffs who assert an \u201cinterest \narguably sought to be protected by the statute\u201d may \ninvoke these remedies. Thompson v. N. Am. Stainless, \nLP, 562 U.S. 170, 177\u201378 (2011). But this \u201czone-of-\ninterests\u201d test is \u201cnot meant to be especially demanding.\u201d \nMatch-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish \nBand \nof \nPottawatomi \nIndians v. Patchak, 567 U.S. 209, 224\u201325 (2012). It bars a \nplaintiff only if her asserted \u201cinterests are so marginally \nrelated to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the \nstatute that it cannot reasonably be assumed that \nCongress intended to permit the suit.\u201d Thompson, 562 \nU.S. at 178; see also, e.g., Bank of Am. Corp. v. City of \nMiami, 581 U.S. 189, 200 (2017) (holding that Miami could \nsue under the Fair Housing Act for financial injury \nincurred from discriminatory lending practices). Which is \nto say, this textual limitation cuts off only suits that are far \nafield from the statute\u2019s purposes\u2014for example, a \n\u201cshareholder\u201d suit against a corporation over its \u201cfiring \n[of] a valuable employee for racially discriminatory \nreasons.\u201d Thompson, 562 U.S. at 177. \nAssuming that the same zone-of-interest test applies, \nretirees in Lt. Stanley\u2019s shoes satisfy it. The ADA\u2019s \n\u201ccomprehensive\u201d mandate to \u201celiminat[e]\u201d discrimination, \n42 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 12101(b)(1), \naims \nnot \njust \nat \nthe \n\u201cpersist[ence]\u201d of discrimination in \u201cjobs,\u201d but also in the \ndistribution of \u201cbenefits,\u201d id. \u00a7 12101(a)(5). So there could \nbe no doubt that retirees\u2019 claims would fall within the Act\u2019s \nzone of interests. See Lexmark Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Static Control \nComponents, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 131 (2014) (explaining \nthat, when a statute contains a \u201cdetailed statement of [its] \n\n- 19 - \n \npurposes,\u201d no \u201cguesswork\u201d is required to determine the \nzone of interests). It\u2019s hard to imagine anyone better \nsituated to bring this claim\u2014over her benefits stemming \nfrom her job\u2014than Lt. Stanley. \nB. The what: The ADA protects against \ndiscrimination with respect to post-\nemployment benefits. \nThe ADA\u2019s substantive prohibitions\u2014the what\u2014also \nreach claims from retirees. The ADA specifically guards \nagainst discrimination in post-employment benefits. It \ntargets not just discrimination in hiring and firing but also \nforbids \u201cdiscriminat[ing] against a qualified individual on \nthe basis of disability in regard to \u2026 employee \ncompensation \u2026 and \nother \nterms, \nconditions, \nand \nprivileges of employment.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a). By the \ntime the ADA was enacted in 1990, this Court had already \nmade clear that Title VII\u2019s parallel language protected \npost-employment benefits. See, e.g., Hishon, 467 U.S. at \n77; Norris, 463 U.S. at 1081.   \nThat\u2019s because \u201c[a] benefit need not accrue before a \nperson\u2019s employment is completed\u201d to be protected. \nHishon, 467 U.S. at 77. What matters, instead, is that the \nbenefit is \u201cpart and parcel of the employment \nrelationship\u201d; if it is, it may not be \u201cdoled out in a \ndiscriminatory fashion.\u201d Id. at 75. That common-sense \nconclusion means that \u201c[t]here is no question\u201d that \n\u201cretirement benefits\u201d are protected. Norris, 463 U.S. at \n1079; see also Hishon, 467 U.S. at 77. In the twenty-five \nyears between Title VII\u2019s passage and the ADA\u2019s passage, \nthis Court repeatedly entertained Title VII claims about \npost-employment benefits. See Long, 487 U.S. at 225; \nNorris, 463 U.S. at 1074; Manhart, 435 U.S. at 705.  \n\n- 20 - \n \nWhen the ADA adopted Title VII\u2019s terminology, it \ncarried forward this settled meaning. \u201c[T]he enactment of \na new provision that mirrors the existing statutory text \nindicates \u2026 that the new provision has that same \nmeaning.\u201d Lightfoot v. Cendant Mortg. Corp., 580 U.S. 82, \n95 (2017). And the ADA\u2019s protection of post-employment \nbenefits is confirmed by other sections. For example, the \nADA prohibits employers from contracting with an \n\u201corganization providing fringe benefits\u201d in a way that \u201chas \nthe effect\u201d of discriminating on the basis of disability. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(2). \u201c[F]ringe benefits\u201d has a well-\naccepted meaning, and it encompasses post-employment \nbenefits. Howard Delivery Serv., Inc. v. Zurich Am. Ins. \nCo., 547 U.S. 651, 654 (2006); see also 135 Cong. Rec. \nS10712 (daily ed. Sept. 7, 1989) (statement of Sen. Harkin) \n(describing the hope that covered individuals would \u201clive \n[their] retirement years in dignity\u201d); Oversight Hearing \non H.R. 4498 before a Subcomm. of H. Comm. Educ. & \nLabor, 100th Cong. 2d Sess. 54 (1988) (describing the \nADA\u2019s focus on protecting disabled Americans\u2019 \u201cbenefits \nfor \u2026 health and retirement\u201d). \nAdd that all together, and it is clear that a retiree in \nLt. Stanley\u2019s position has a right to sue. Whether or not \nsuch a retiree is a \u201cqualified individual\u201d when they \nexperience the effects of the discrimination, they are a \ndisabled employee claiming that their employer applied a \ndiscriminatory policy (which the ADA prohibits) to strip \nthem of their benefits (which the ADA protects).  \nIn fact, a benefits policy that facially discriminates \nagainst people with disabilities\u2014everyone in the company \nreceives a pension, except for people with disabilities\u2014\nnecessarily runs afoul of the ADA. It obviously \n\u201cdiscriminate[s] \u2026 on the basis of disability.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\n- 21 - \n \n\u00a7 12112(a). And it does so with regard to \u201ccompensation,\u201d \nid., which is paid to people in exchange for their \n\u201cperform[ance of] the essential functions\u201d of an \n\u201cemployment position,\u201d id. \u00a7 12111(8).  \nIn other words, in understanding what the statute \nprotects, the \u201cqualified individual\u201d language is largely \nbeside the point in a case of this kind. As a general \nproposition, employers only pay \u201ccompensation\u201d to \n\u201cqualified individuals\u201d who \u201ccan perform the essential \nfunctions of the employment position that\u201d they \u201chold[] or \ndesire[].\u201d Id. And we know from preexisting usage that \nsuch \u201ccompensation\u201d includes benefits employees receive \nafter retirement. So when employers discriminate \u201cin \nregard to \u2026 compensation,\u201d they necessarily do so \n\u201cagainst a qualified individual.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12112(a). And as the \nnext section explains, it is proper for an employee (or \nformer employee) to sue whenever such a discriminatory \ncompensation policy affects them\u2014including when they \nreceive their benefits only after retiring. \nC. The when: The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act \nand Title I\u2019s enforcement provision taken \ntogether mean that retirees can sue over post-\nemployment benefits. \nIt is clear, then, that retirees are among the \u201cany \nperson[s]\u201d \u201cclaiming to be aggrieved\u201d who can invoke \nTitle I\u2019s enforcement mechanism. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5. So \ntoo is it clear that their retirement benefits are \n\u201ccompensation\u201d protected by the Act. Id. \u00a7 12112(a). The \nLilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, which Title I \nincorporates, brings Lt. Stanley\u2019s claim across the finish \nline: It allows retirees to bring suit when they are \n\u201caffected by application of\u201d discriminatory benefits plans \n\u201cadopted\u201d while they were working. Id. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A).  \n\n- 22 - \n \n1. Before the Fair Pay Act, those seeking to challenge \ndiscriminatory \npolicies \naffecting \npost-employment \nbenefits faced a challenge: Like Lt. Stanley, they may not \nhave learned about their discriminatory benefits policies \nuntil they were affected after retiring. That could be years \nafter the policies were adopted. Because such a claim \ncould have been characterized as merely seeking redress \nfor the \u201cadverse effects resulting from the past \ndiscrimination,\u201d it could well have been barred by the \nstatute of limitations. Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & \nRubber Co., 550 U.S. 618, 628 (2007). \nThe Fair Pay Act resolved this dilemma. It provides \nthat an unlawful employment practice occurs with respect \nto discrimination in compensation: \n[1] when a discriminatory compensation decision \nor other practice is adopted, [2] when an individual \nbecomes subject to a discriminatory compensation \ndecision or other practice, or [3] when an \nindividual is affected by application of a \ndiscriminatory compensation decision or other \npractice, including each time wages, benefits, or \nother compensation is paid, resulting in whole or \nin part from such a decision or other practice. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A). This provision applies to the \nADA through its incorporation of Title VII\u2019s enforcement \nmechanisms. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12117(a). \nThe Fair Pay Act thus makes clear that a claim under \nthe ADA is timely if the plaintiff sues when she \u201cbecomes \nsubject to\u201d or \u201cis affected by\u201d discrimination that occurred \nduring her tenure. This is true even if the plaintiff doesn\u2019t \nreceive the benefit in question until after her employment \nhas concluded. As a result, the Act permits a plaintiff to \nchallenge an employer\u2019s earlier decision to adopt a \n\n- 23 - \n \ndiscriminatory benefits policy when she is adversely \naffected, either by receiving a reduced benefit or by being \ndenied the benefit entirely. \nCrucially, the Fair Pay Act allows a plaintiff\u2019s claim to \naccrue or re-accrue even after the plaintiff\u2019s employment \nhas concluded. As long as the plaintiff \u201cbecomes subject \nto\u201d or \u201cis affected by application of\u201d the employer\u2019s earlier \ndiscriminatory decision after leaving her job, the \nemployer\u2019s liability will accrue or re-accrue then. 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A), (B). The Eleventh Circuit\u2019s view \nthat a former employee is no longer a \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d because she neither \u201cholds\u201d nor \u201cdesires\u201d a job \nhas no bearing on this analysis. 42 U.S.C. 12111(8). The \nFair Pay Act doesn\u2019t treat each discrete payment (or \nnonpayment) as a new discriminatory act that must \nindependently satisfy all of the ADA\u2019s elements. Rather, \nit allows a claim to accrue based on the past discriminatory \ndecision when the plaintiff is affected by that decision. \nThe Fair Pay Act eliminates any doubt about a \npotential mismatch between Congress\u2019s intent to broadly \nprohibit disability-based discrimination in retirement \nbenefits and the ADA\u2019s text. It ensures that plaintiffs can \ntimely enforce the settled rule that \u201cclassification of \nemployees on the basis of [disability] is no more \npermissible at the pay-out stage of a retirement plan than \nat the pay-in stage.\u201d Norris, 463 U.S. at 1081. And it \nreinforces what the ADA\u2019s text, structure, and purpose \nalready make clear: Former employees are protected \nfrom discrimination as to post-employment benefits.  \n2. When Lt. Stanley began her career as a firefighter, \nthe City promised to continue paying her health-insurance \nsubsidy until the age of 65 so long as she \u201cretire[d] with \ntwenty-five (25) years of service\u201d or \u201cretire[d] for \n\n- 24 - \n \ndisability reasons.\u201d Doc. 38-6 at 2; Pet. App. 21a. That \nretirement subsidy was, without a doubt, part of her \n\u201ccompensation\u201d and thus protected by Title I. 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 12112; see supra 19\u201321. Four years later, and while Lt. \nStanley was still working as a firefighter, the City changed \nits policy to distinguish between \u201cdisabled\u201d and \u201cnormal\u201d \nretirees. Doc. 1 at 12; see also Doc. 39-16 at 27\u201328. The \nlatter were still eligible for the full retirement benefit, but \nthe former would now receive only two years of the health \ncare subsidy (or less, if they qualified for Medicare \nbenefits). Pet. App. 22a. \nLt. Stanley was, of course, employed by the City in \n2003 when this \u201cdiscriminatory compensation decision\u201d \nthat she challenges was \u201cadopted.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-\n5(e)(3)(A). Thus, even if Lt. Stanley did need to hold or \ndesire a job when the City discriminated against her (but \nsee infra Part II), she did. The City \u201cadopted,\u201d id., its \npolicy in 2003 when Lt. Stanley indisputably was a \nqualified individual, and that policy discriminated \u201con the \nbasis of disability in regard to \u2026 employee compensation\u201d \n(her benefits), id. \u00a7 12112(a). Lt. Stanley\u2019s claim then re-\naccrued in 2020 when she was \u201caffected by application of\u201d \nthe policy (she was denied the health care subsidy). Id. \n\u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A). That means that she could bring this \nlawsuit exactly when she did to challenge exactly what she \nchallenged.   \nThe Eleventh Circuit rejected this reasoning by \nannouncing that Lt. Stanley \u201cconcedes, and we agree, that \nher claim cannot turn on the 2003 amendment to the \nbenefits plan because she was not yet disabled at that \ntime.\u201d App. 16. Nothing supports the assertion that Lt. \nStanley made that concession. To the contrary, Lt. \nStanley repeatedly argued the opposite, insisting that the \n\n- 25 - \n \nadoption \nof \nthe \npolicy \ndid \nconstitute \nunlawful \ndiscrimination against her. See, e.g., Doc. 1 at 4 \n(allegations in complaint addressing 2003 change); Op. Br. \nat viii\u2013ix (expressly adopting similar argument made in \nthe United States\u2019 amicus brief); Reply Br. at 6 (\u201cIn this \ncase, \nthe \nCity\u2019s \ndecision \nto \nenact \nthe \nfacially \ndiscriminatory 24-Month Rule in 2003 is the initial \n\u2018challenged employment decision.\u2019 \u2026 Thus, [Lt.] Stanley \nwas a \u2018Qualified Individual\u2019 able to perform her firefighter \nduties at the time of the \u2018challenged employment \ndecision.\u2019\u201d) (emphasis omitted); Oral Arg. 4:59\u20135:05 (\u201cAt \nthe time of the discriminatory act in 2003 she was a \nqualified individual.\u201d).  \nTo the extent the Eleventh Circuit held that the 2003 \npolicy change could not be actionable discrimination \nbecause Lt. Stanley \u201cwas not yet disabled at that time,\u201d it \nmisapplied the statute. App. 16. A person need not be \ndisabled to be subjected to unlawful discrimination under \nTitle I. The statute was specifically amended to avoid that \noutcome: It broadly prohibits discrimination \u201con the basis \nof disability\u201d rather than, as it had previously provided, \nonly against a qualified individual \u201cwith a disability.\u201d \nCompare 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a), with Pub. L. No. 101-336, \nTitle I, \u00a7 102, 104 Stat. 331 (1990). Here, the City acted \u201con \nthe basis of disability\u201d when it adopted a policy that, on its \nface, limits the amount of time that a person receives a \nsubsidy based on whether that person has a disability. See \nUAW v. Johnson Controls, Inc., 499 U.S. 187, 200 (1991) \n(\u201c[A]n explicit gender-based policy is sex discrimination \nunder\u201d Title VII).  \nIt is of no matter, then, that Lt. Stanley was not yet \ndisabled when the City changed its policy. Even if that was \n(somehow) relevant, it was inevitable that the facially \n\n- 26 - \n \ndiscriminatory policy would harm employees when they \nbecame disabled and had to retire before twenty-five \nyears of service. The Court may thus conceive of this claim \nas encompassing two moments of time that complete the \nwhole: when the facially discriminatory policy was \nadopted in 2003, and when Lt. Stanley became disabled. \nThis Court has recognized that certain Title VII claims \ncan encompass events occurring at different points in time \nas the basis for an action challenging a \u201csingle \ndiscriminatory act.\u201d Green v. Brennan, 578 U.S. 547, 562 \nn.7 (2016). By analogy, the same holds true here.  \nThe Fair Pay Act also demonstrates that the City \ndiscriminated against Lt. Stanley again when that same \ndiscriminatory policy was applied to her as she neared her \ninevitable early retirement. At that point, although she did \nnot yet feel the effects of the policy, Lt. Stanley became \n\u201csubject to\u201d it, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A); the policy \nconclusively determined what benefits she would receive \nonce her fast-approaching forced retirement began and, in \nthat way, removed her access to the more expansive \nbenefits package available to people without disabilities. \nSee Castellano v. City of New York, 142 F.3d 58, 68 (2d \nCir. 1998) (\u201c[A]n employee\u2019s entitlement to post-\nemployment fringe benefits arises \u2026 during his period of \nemployment.\u201d). That too is an \u201cunlawful employment \npractice\u201d \nthat \n\u201coccur[ed]\u201d \nduring \nLt. \nStanley\u2019s \nemployment. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A).1  \n \n1 The third way in which an unlawful employment practice \noccurs\u2014the individual becoming \u201caffected\u201d by the discriminatory \ndecision\u2014remains relevant here because it removes any doubt that \nLt. Stanley\u2019s claim is timely. She was \u201caffected\u201d when her subsidy \nended.  \n\n- 27 - \n \nThe Eleventh Circuit declined to address that alleged \ndiscrimination too, because Lt. Stanley \u201caffirmatively \nconceded\u201d that she was not \u201cimpacted by [the City\u2019s \npolicy] during her employment.\u201d App. 18. But that Lt. \nStanley was not yet \u201cimpacted\u201d (in terms of receiving a \ndecreased health care subsidy) in no way undermines her \nclaim. That\u2019s what the Fair Pay Act makes clear: A person \ncan be discriminated against when a \u201cdecision\u201d or \n\u201cpractice\u201d is \u201cadopted,\u201d or when they \u201cbecome[] subject \nto\u201d it, even if they are not \u201caffected by\u201d it until later. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A).  \nII. The ADA does not require a person to \u201chold[] or \ndesire[]\u201d a job to be a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d  \nThe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s holding was wrong for \nanother, independent reason: One does not need to \ncurrently \u201chold[] or desire\u201d a job to be a \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d under the ADA. The court below reached its \nholding by focusing on the definition of discrimination in \nsection 12112(a) and of \u201cqualified individual\u201d in section \n12111(8). Based on those provisions, it held that it is legal \nfor employers to discriminate against former employees \non the basis of disability.  \nNothing in the statute\u2019s text demands that surprising \nresult. The Eleventh Circuit\u2019s error is explained by its \nmisunderstanding \nof \nthe \ndefinition \nof \n\u201cqualified \nindividual.\u201d In the court\u2019s view, because section 12112(a) \nprohibits discrimination against \u201cqualified individuals\u201d \nand the definition of \u201cqualified individual\u201d speaks in the \npresent tense\u2014referring to a person who \u201ccan perform\u201d a \njob that the person \u201cholds\u201d or \u201cdesires\u201d\u2014the ADA \nprohibits discrimination only against a person while they \nhold (or are applying to) a job. App. 11.  \n\n- 28 - \n \nBut the court of appeals effectively rewrote the \nstatutory definition to impose two distinct requirements: \n\u201cQualified individual means an individual who (a) holds or \ndesires an employment position and (b) can perform the \nessential functions of that employment position.\u201d The text \nonly imposes one requirement: \u201c[Q]ualified individual \nmeans an individual who \u2026 can perform the essential \nfunctions of the employment position that such individual \nholds or desires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. 12111(8). The text asks only \none question\u2014what \u201ccan\u201d you do? \nThis understanding of the definition\u2019s text makes \nperfect sense given its role in the statute: It operates to \nafford employers cabined authority to act on the basis of \ndisability when doing so is necessary to preserve the \nfunctioning of the business. That is why the term is \ndefined with reference to \u201cessential functions,\u201d not \u201cany \nfunction.\u201d Its text is best read to impose only a conditional \nmandate, which tracks that role. If a person has (or seeks) \na job, that person must be able to perform its essential \nfunctions; if no such job exists\u2014because the person is \nretired\u2014the definition does not operate as a limit on the \nADA\u2019s prohibition on discrimination. In other words, the \ndefinition asks if you \u201ccan\u201d perform the functions of a job \nthat you hold or desire, not if you have or want one.  \nA. The text of section 12111(8) and its place in \nthe statutory scheme confirm that the \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition tests if you \ncan do a job, not if you have one.   \nThe definition of \u201cqualified individual\u201d exists to give \nemployers the cabined ability to act on the basis of job-\nrelated concerns so that they are not forced to hire or \nretain people who are incapable, even with the benefit of \nreasonable accommodations, of performing essential \n\n- 29 - \n \ntasks. We know that is the definition\u2019s role because of its \nplain text, its place in the statutory scheme, and its \nrelationship to other sections of the statute.  \n1. Text and purpose. \u201cStart with the text.\u201d Arellano v. \nMcDonough, 598 U.S. 1, 8 (2023). The definition asks if an \nindividual \u201ccan perform the essential functions of the \nemployment position that such individual holds or \ndesires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8) (emphasis added). It does \nnot ask if an individual \u201cholds or desires an employment \nposition whose essential functions she can perform.\u201d The \nlatter formulation would impose the \u201cmust hold or desire \na job\u201d requirement that the Eleventh Circuit perceived. \nThe former asks if you \u201ccan\u201d do a thing, not if you are \ndoing that thing or would do it.  \nThat the definition asks what an individual \u201ccan\u201d do \nmakes sense given its role in the statutory scheme. The \ndefinition gives employers necessary, but circumscribed, \nflexibility in light of the Act\u2019s sweeping impact. Title I \nprovides protection in all aspects of the employment \nrelationship. It broadly prohibits \u201cdiscriminat[ion]\u201d in \n\u201cjob application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or \ndischarge of employees, employee compensation, job \ntraining, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of \nemployment.\u201d \n42 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 12112(a). \nThat \ncovers \neverything from job applications to post-employment \nbenefits\u2014if something is \u201cpart and parcel of the \nemployment \nrelationship,\u201d \nan \nemployer \ncannot \n\u201cdiscriminate.\u201d Hishon, 467 U.S. at 75; supra at 19\u201321.  \nTitle I prohibits both \u201cdisparate treatment\u201d and \n\u201cdisparate impact.\u201d Raytheon Co. v. Hernandez, 540 U.S. \n44, 52 (2003). But it also goes further, \u201crequir[ing] \naffirmative \nconduct\u201d \nto \nensure \n\u201cthose \nwith \ndisabilities \u2026 obtain the same workplace opportunities \n\n- 30 - \n \nthat those without disabilities [] enjoy.\u201d Barnett, 535 U.S. \nat 397, 401; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A). Accordingly, the \nAct at times requires employers not to treat people with \ndisabilities \nequally, \nbut \ninstead \nto \ntreat \nthem \n\u201cpreferentially.\u201d \nBarnett, \n535 U.S. \nat \n397. \nThat \naffirmative mandate is reflected in the Act\u2019s definition of \ndiscrimination, which \u201cincludes \u2026 not making reasonable \naccommodations to the known physical or mental \nlimitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a \ndisability who is an applicant or employee.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A).  \nBecause of the Act\u2019s \u201cbold ambitions\u201d and \u201cfar-\nreaching\u201d scope, though, Congress recognized the need \nfor delineated \u201climits.\u201d Kincaid v. Williams, 143 S. Ct. \n2414, 2415\u201316 (2023) (Alito, J., dissenting from the denial \nof certiorari). As this Court has held, the ADA achieves its \nimportant \u201cobjectives\u201d within \u201cthe realm of the \nreasonable.\u201d Barnett, 535 U.S. at 401. Without some \nqualification, the statute would prevent employers from \ndenying employment to people whose disabilities, no \nmatter the steps taken to accommodate them, prevent \nthem from performing their jobs. A swimming pool could \nface liability for refusing to hire as a lifeguard a person \nwhose disability left her unable to swim. Congress, \nunsurprisingly, did not want to prohibit that sort of \nrational, and necessary, decision-making.  \nThe \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition ensures that \nemployers have the necessary leeway. The only people \nwho employers must hire, retain, and accommodate are \nthose who, \u201cwith or without\u201d accommodations, \u201ccan \nperform the essential functions of the employment \nposition.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8). The definition, then, exists \nto allow employers to screen out people who can\u2019t perform \n\n- 31 - \n \nthe core, or \u201cessential,\u201d functions of the job at issue. What \nit does not do, however, is grant employers a license to \nimplement \ndiscriminatory \nemployment \npolicies \nor \nindividual employment actions that have nothing to do \nwith an individual\u2019s ability to do a relevant job.  \n2. Statutory scheme. This understanding of the \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition\u2014as a screen that \nprevents employers from being obligated to hire and \naccommodate those who can\u2019t perform a job\u2014neatly \naligns with the rest of the statutory scheme that Congress \ndevised. Several provisions of the Act allow employers to \ntake actions that are justified in relation to the operation \nof their business. None of them invite employers to take \ndiscriminatory actions that have nothing to do with \nlegitimate business needs.  \nFor example, even when employers must provide \naccommodations, they need only be \u201creasonable,\u201d and \neven those they can forego if they \u201ccan demonstrate that \nthe accommodation would impose an undue hardship\u201d on \ntheir \u201coperation.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A). \u201c[Q]ualification \nstandards\u201d that screen out people with disabilities are \nimpermissible, unless that standard \u201cis shown to be job-\nrelated for the position in question and is consistent with \nbusiness necessity.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12112(b)(6). Other examples are \nsprinkled across the statute. See, e.g., id. \u00a7 12112(b)(7) \n(making it unlawful to administer \u201ctests concerning \nemployment\u201d unless those tests measure a person\u2019s \naptitude and skills rather than merely reflecting any \nimpairments); \nid. \n\u00a7 \n12112(d)(2) \n(prohibiting \npre-\nemployment \nmedical \nexaminations \nbut \npermitting \n\u201cinquiries into the ability of an applicant to perform job-\nrelated functions\u201d).  \n\n- 32 - \n \nEach of these provisions reflects a balance struck in \nthe Act: Discrimination is prohibited\u2014from application \nthrough retirement\u2014but employers have leeway to act on \nthe basis of disability where a sufficiently weighty and \nlegitimate business need calls for it. The \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d definition does just that\u2014nothing more, \nnothing less. It is not concerned with whether you have a \njob; it is concerned with employers\u2019 needs in relation to \ntheir current and future employees. Reading it to allow \ndiscrimination against former employees, by contrast \nmakes it do work in the statute that it simply is not doing. \n3. Surplusage. The court of appeals\u2019 reading also turns \nkey provisions of the Act into surplusage. It is a \u201c\u2018cardinal \nprincipal\u2019 of interpretation that courts must give effect, if \npossible, to every clause and word of a statute.\u201d Parker \nDrilling Mgmt. Servs., Ltd. v. Newton, 587 U.S. 601, 602 \n(2019). Accordingly, the canon against surplusage \ninstructs that a statute should be construed \u201cso that no \npart will be inoperative or superfluous, void or \ninsignificant.\u201d Rubin v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 583 U.S. \n202, 213 (2018). \nThe ADA\u2019s definition of discrimination, section \n12112(b)(5)(A), states that discrimination \u201cincludes \u2026 not \nmaking reasonable accommodations to the known physical \nor mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual \nwith a disability who is an applicant or employee.\u201d 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A) (emphasis added).  \nThis language tells us that the Act contemplates the \nexistence of some qualified individuals who are neither \n\u201capplicant[s] [n]or employee[s].\u201d If the court of appeals \nwas right that the qualified individual definition already \nscreens out individuals who do not \u201chold[] or desire[]\u201d a \njob, then this modifier\u2014\u201cwho is an applicant or employee\u201d \n\n- 33 - \n \n\u2014would be surplusage. And an interpretation that \n\u201ctreat[s]\u201d those \u201cstatutory terms as surplusage,\u201d \nparticularly when they\u2019re found in such a \u201cpivotal [] place \nin the statutory scheme\u201d (the reasonable-accommodation \nprovision), should give us pause. Duncan v. Walker, \n533 U.S. 167, 174 (2001). \u201cThe canon against surplusage is \nstrongest \nwhen \nan \ninterpretation \nwould \nrender \nsuperfluous another part of the same statutory scheme.\u201d \nCity of Chicago v. Fulton, 592 U.S. 154, 159 (2021).   \nThat there are \u201cqualified individual[s]\u201d not covered by \nsection 12112\u2019s reasonable-accommodation mandate is \nconfirmed by the other way its reach is narrowed. \nEmployers need only make reasonable accommodations \nfor \u201cqualified individual[s] with a disability.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A) (emphasis added). To be a \u201cqualified \nindividual,\u201d though, you need not have a disability. The \nADA was specifically amended to extend the \u201cgeneral\u201d \nantidiscrimination mandate not only to discrimination \nagainst persons \u201cwith a disability,\u201d but to more broadly \nreach discrimination \u201con the basis of disability.\u201d Compare \nPub. L. No. 101-336, Title I, \u00a7 102, 104 Stat. 331 (1990), \nwith 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a). Because there are \u201cqualified \nindividual[s]\u201d who are not disabled, as well as those who \nno longer hold or desire a job, then, the reasonable-\naccommodation provision makes perfect sense. That \nsection recognizes the breadth of who can be a \u201cqualified \nindividual,\u201d and then subtracts from its mandate the need \nto accommodate any \u201cqualified individual\u201d who is not a \nperson \u201cwith a disability\u201d and who is not \u201can applicant or \nemployee,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A)\u2014because only \ndisabled individuals engaged in (or seeking) active \nemployment actually need \u201caccommodations.\u201d   \n\n- 34 - \n \nSection 12112 thus demonstrates that, when Congress \nintended to limit the reach of a substantive protection to \napplicants and employees, it did so explicitly. \nB. Common usage, grammar, and logic all \ndemonstrate that the text does not compel \nreading \u201cqualified individual\u201d to exclude \nretirees. \nNothing in the text of the definition of \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d demands reading it to require that an \nindividual currently hold or desire a job. The Eleventh \nCircuit concluded otherwise, reasoning that, because of \nthe definition, the \u201cplain language\u201d of the anti-\ndiscrimination rule \u201cexpressly applie[s] only to \u2018qualified \nindividuals with a disability\u2019 who \u2018hold[]\u2019 or \u2018desire[]\u2019 an \n\u2018employment position.\u2019\u201d App. 7. But that reading seemed \nplain only because the court of appeals misunderstood a \nkey part of the definition: \nThe \nterm \n\u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d \nmeans \nan \nindividual who, with or without reasonable \naccommodation, \ncan \nperform \nthe \nessential \nfunctions of the employment position that such \nindividual holds or desires. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8) (emphasis added). It is the \u201ccan \nperform\u201d clause that makes the definition carry out its \nimportant role in the statute. See supra 29\u201331. That\u2019s how \nit tests an employee\u2019s capabilities. And retirees are not \nunable to pass this test\u2014that is, they\u2019re not unable to \nperform the essential functions of a job that they hold or \ndesire. \nTo be sure, testing the job capabilities of someone who \nis no longer working may seem logically awkward. But \nthat doesn\u2019t mean that retirees fail the test; it instead \n\n- 35 - \n \nhighlights the conditional nature of the requirement. And, \nas we explain below, common sense, common usage, and \nlogic all suggest that the best reading (or at least an \nequally plausible one) is that retirees are \u201cqualified \nindividuals.\u201d But even if one thought that the test was \nambiguous when applied to retirees, that still would \nrequire rejecting the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s reading, which is \n\u201c[in]consistent with the broader context\u201d of Title I \u201cand \nthe primary purpose of\u201d the \u201cqualified individual\u201d \ndefinition. Robinson, 519 U.S. at 849; see id. (holding that \n\u201cthe term \u2018employees,\u2019 as used in \u00a7 704(a) of Title VII\u201d \ncovers \u201cformer employees\u201d despite the text being \n\u201cambiguous\u201d because that reading is \u201cmore consistent \nwith the broader context of Title VII and the primary \npurpose of \u00a7 704(a)\u201d). \n1. Common usage. Title I defines a \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d as \u201can individual who, with or without \nreasonable accommodation, can perform the essential \nfunctions of the employment position that such individual \nholds or desires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8). The Eleventh \nCircuit mistakenly read that definition to require that an \nindividual currently hold or desire a job. But that is not \nthe only (or best) way to read the definition. A few parallel \nexamples demonstrate how an ordinary reader interprets \na sentence like this one.  \n\u201cYou can\u2019t watch the movie unless you silence your cell \nphone.\u201d If you come to the theater without a phone, do you \nviolate this rule? Surely no. That\u2019s because this rule \nrequires that patrons turn off their phones only to the \nextent that they have phones to turn off. For the same \nreason, a person without a phone can attend court despite \na rule that says \u201c[y]ou must turn off your cell phone before \n\n- 36 - \n \nentering the courtroom.\u201d2 The rules\u2014and their respective \npurposes\u2014are satisfied. \u201c[C]ommon sense,\u201d Pereira v. \nSessions, 585 U.S. 198, 211 (2018), tells us how to read \nthese rules. See Bond v. United States, 572 U.S. 844, 857 \n(2014) (\u201cThe notion that some things \u2018go without saying\u2019 \napplies to legislation just as it does to everyday life.\u201d). \nConsider another example. NASA gives an award each \nyear to the \u201camateur astronomer\u201d who \u201cdiscovered the \nintrinsically brightest near-Earth asteroid\u201d in the \nprevious year. 51 U.S.C. \u00a7 30902(c)(3)(A). As defined by \nthe statute, \u201camateur astronomer means an individual \nwhose employer does not provide any funding, payment, \nor compensation to the individual for the observation of \nasteroids and other celestial bodies.\u201d Id. \u00a7 30902(b)(1). Is \nan unemployed person with a home telescope eligible to \nwin that prize? Of course. What this rule obviously means \nin context is that, if you have an employer and if that \nemployer pays for your stargazing, you can\u2019t be an \n\u201camateur astronomer.\u201d Unemployed people don\u2019t fail that \ntest; they easily pass it.  \nOr try this one: \u201cA passenger may not board an \naircraft unless it is determined that the passenger is a \n\u2018cleared individual.\u2019\u201d \u201cA \u2018cleared individual\u2019 means an \nindividual who can successfully complete an x-ray \nscreening of the baggage that such individual carries or \nchecks.\u201d Does this hypothetical rule prohibit passengers \nwith no bags from boarding a plane? Obviously not. This \nrule doesn\u2019t require that a passenger have a carry-on or \nchecked bag; it requires the screening of any bag to the \nextent that a passenger has such luggage.  \n \n2 Thomas F. Eagleton U.S. Courthouse Self-Guided Tour, \nhttps://perma.cc/2BVB-2K4P. \n\n- 37 - \n \nIndeed, an actual TSA regulation provides that \u201c[n]o \nindividual may \u2026 board an aircraft without submitting to \nthe screening and inspection of\u201d her \u201caccessible \nproperty[.]\u201d 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1540.107(a). This regulation \nobviously doesn\u2019t require that a passenger carry any \n\u201caccessible property,\u201d only that she submit to the \nscreening of that property to the extent she has any.  \nAnother federal statute requires the government to \npay individuals for the \u201ccost of a comparable replacement \ndwelling\u201d when a federal project displaces them. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4623(a)(1)(A). Whether something qualifies as \na \n\u201ccomparable \nreplacement \ndwelling\u201d \nrequires \nconsidering how far away it is from the displaced person\u2019s \noriginal home \u201cwith respect to public utilities, facilities, \nservices, and \nthe \ndisplaced \nperson\u2019s \nplace \nof \nemployment.\u201d Id. \u00a7 4601(10) (emphasis added). The lack \nof a \u201cplace of employment\u201d can\u2019t possibly bar retirees \nfrom financial support.  \nNotably, Title II of the ADA has a similar textual \nfeature. That section forbids discrimination in public \n\u201cservices, programs, or activities.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132. Like \nTitle I, it makes use of \u201cqualified individual\u201d language: \n\u201c[N]o qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason \nof such disability, be excluded from participation in or be \ndenied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities \nof a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any \nsuch entity.\u201d Id. And its definition of \u201cqualified individual\u201d \nhas a similar structure to Title I\u2019s: \u201c[Q]ualified individual \nwith a disability means an individual with a disability who, \nwith or without reasonable modifications to rules, policies, \nor \npractices \u2026 meets \nthe \nessential \neligibility \nrequirements for the receipt of services or the \n\n- 38 - \n \nparticipation in programs or activities provided by a public \nentity.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12131(2) (emphasis added). \nNow consider a \u201crecreational\u201d program covered by the \nAct, United States v. Georgia, 546 U.S. 151, 157 (2006) \n(discussing \ndefinition \nof \n\u201cservices, \nprograms, \nor \nactivities\u201d), like the Washington & Old Dominion trail, \nwhich has no \u201cessential eligibility requirements\u201d for \n\u201cparticipation,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12131(2). The trail is open to \neveryone free of charge. Except that it has one rule: \u201cNo \npeople in wheelchairs.\u201d That blatant exclusion certainly \nviolates Title II. The fact that the trail has no \u201cessential \neligibility requirements\u201d does not mean the excluded \nperson with a disability ceases to be a \u201cqualified \nindividual.\u201d Instead, Title II is naturally read to say that, \nto \nthe \nextent \nthere \nare \n\u201cessential \neligibility \nrequirements,\u201d an individual must meet them. \nAlthough rules written this way can sometimes read \nawkwardly when their implicit condition fails, courts \nroutinely figure out how to interpret them. Take the \nfederal \ncompassionate-release \nstatute. \nThat \nlaw \nauthorizes a court to \u201cmodify a term of imprisonment\u201d \nwhen, among other things, the \u201creduction is consistent \nwith applicable policy statements issued by the \nSentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(A). In \nthe period after Congress passed the First Step Act, but \nbefore the Sentencing Commission revised its policy \nstatement, \nthe \n\u201coverwhelming \nmajority \nof \ncircuits \u2026 agreed that\u201d the only potentially relevant \npolicy statement was not \u201capplicable.\u201d 3 Charles Alan \nWright & Arthur R. Miller, Fed. Prac. & Proc. Crim. \n\u00a7 638.2 (5th ed. 2024). But courts didn\u2019t get hung up on \nwhether modifying a term of imprisonment was or wasn\u2019t \n\u201cconsistent\u201d \nwith \na \nnon-existent \nset \nof \n\u201cpolicy \n\n- 39 - \n \nstatements.\u201d Instead, they (sensibly) read the text to \nmean that a sentence reduction must be consistent with \nthe applicable policy statements to the extent there are \nany. Id. at nn. 23\u201324 (explaining that eight of nine circuits \nwho considered the question took this view, with the \nEleventh Circuit as the lone \u201coutlier\u201d). \nAs the compassionate-release cases demonstrate, \n\u201ccourts can \u2026 find implied conditionality as a function of \na statute\u2019s syntax\u201d and \u201cthe nature of written language.\u201d \nEric S.

Udall, 373 U.S. 472, 479 (1963) (in a \ncase where there was \u201cno lease to cancel,\u201d declining to \nread a provision on lease cancellation\u2014which \u201csp[oke] \nentirely in terms of post-lease occurrences\u201d and \n\u201cassume[d] the existence of a valid lease\u201d\u2014to render the \nAct as a whole \u201cself-defeating\u201d).3 \nIn each example above, the rule presumes that some \npredicate condition exists (you have an employer, luggage, \n \n3 The proposition that some sentences are implicitly conditional is \nunextraordinary. \u201cWhen a command is conditional, its condition may \nbe either overt or explicit on the one hand (\u2018When it rains, close the \nwindows!!\u2019) or tacit or implicit on the other (\u2018Drive carefully!\u2019 [means] \n\u2018When you drive, drive carefully!!\u2019).\u201d Nicholas Rescher, The Logic of \nCommands 24 (1966); see also Chi-H\u00e9 Elder, Context, Cognition, and \nConditionals 2 (2019) (\u201c[W]hile conditional sentences in English are \noften associated with the canonical form \u2018if p, q,\u2019 we also know that \nneither the use of \u2018if\u2019 nor a two-clause structure is essential for \nexpressing a conditional thought.\u201d). \n\n- 40 - \n \nor a phone; the program has eligibility requirements), and \nyour compliance with the rule is determined in relation to \nthat predicate. But as each example makes clear, the \nabsence of the thing presumed doesn\u2019t mean that you \nnecessarily violate the rule. Instead, it will often mean (as \nit does in each one of those examples) that the rule is \neffectively satisfied or that its requirement controls only \nto the extent that the predicate condition actually exists.  \nThe \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition in Title I can \neasily be read like each of those examples. The rule tests \nwhether an individual is sufficiently qualified for a job. See \nsupra 29\u201331. Where there is no job and there are no \n\u201cessential functions,\u201d the test is satisfied. And because its \napplication to retirees has no relationship to its textual \nfunction in the statute, common sense says it should not \nbe applied to bar claims by retirees who no longer \n\u201chold[]or desire[]\u201d an \u201cemployment position.\u201d See Biden v. \nNebraska, 143 S. Ct. 2355, 2379 (2023) (Barrett, J., \nconcurring) (\u201cContext also includes common sense.\u201d); The \nFederalist No. 83, at 559 (Alexander Hamilton) (\u201cThe \nrules of legal interpretation are rules of common sense.\u201d). \n2. Grammar. The grammatical structure of the \ndefinition\u2014and the role of the \u201cholds or desires\u201d clause in \nthe sentence in particular\u2014further demonstrates that the \ntext does not compel the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s reading. \nBecause \u201c[w]ords are to be given the meaning that proper \ngrammar and usage would assign them,\u201d Antonin Scalia & \nBryan A. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of \nLegal Texts 140 (2012), the \u201crules of grammar govern\u201d \nstatutory \ninterpretation \n\u201cunless \nthey \ncontradict \nlegislative intent or purpose,\u201d id. (citing Costello v. INS, \n376 U.S. 120, 122\u2013126 (1964)). \n\n- 41 - \n \nConsider this rule at an apartment complex: \u201cYou \nmust clean up after the pets that you own.\u201d Here, \u201cthat \nyou own\u201d tells us which pets we\u2019re talking about: the ones \nyou own, if you own any. It doesn\u2019t mean that you must \nown a pet, or that all pets are owned by you, or that you \nhave to clean up after other people\u2019s pets. The rule is \ntelling us that, if you own a pet, you\u2019ve got to clean up after \nit. Similarly, in the ADA\u2019s definition, the clause \u201cthat such \nindividual holds or desires\u201d modifies \u201cemployment \nposition.\u201d See Barnhart v. Thomas, 540 U.S. 20, 26 (2003) \n(\u201c[A] limiting clause or phrase \u2026 should ordinarily be \nread as modifying only the noun or phrase that it \nimmediately follows.\u201d). It is introduced by the pronoun \n\u201cthat,\u201d which sets up what grammarians call a \u201crestrictive \nclause.\u201d Bryan A. Garner, Modern English Usage 1086\u2013\n87 (5th ed. 2022). This clause simply tells us which \nposition\u2019s functions matter, see id.\u2014here, \u201cthe essential \nfunctions of the employment position that such individual \nholds or desires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8) (emphasis added). \nThe restrictive clause thus does not create a \nfreestanding temporal requirement that an individual \nmust currently hold a job. See Heredia v. Sessions, 865 \nF.3d 60, 69 (2d Cir. 2017) (explaining that \u201ca restrictive \nclause\u201d that modifies a noun in an immigration statute \n\u201cdoes not impose a separate temporal requirement\u201d). \nRather, \nit \nspecifies \nwhich \njob\u2019s \nfunctions \nare \nrelevant if the individual either holds or desires a job.  \nThe court of appeals, however, misread this clause. It \ntreated \u201cholds or desires\u201d as though it imposed a separate \nrequirement, rather than simply identifying the relevant \njob. This misreading assumes that a clause doing one thing \n(specifying which job matters) is instead doing something \nelse entirely (requiring current or future employment). \n\n- 42 - \n \nThe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s emphasis on the present tense-\nverbs thus reflects a basic misunderstanding of the \nrestrictive clause\u2019s grammatical function.  \n \n3. Logic. Reading the \u201cqualified individual\u201d \ndefinition to include retirees like Lt. Stanley not only \nreflects common sense and common usage but is also \nsound as a matter of basic logic: Lt. Stanley satisfies the \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition because she is not unable \nto perform the essential functions of any job that she \ncurrently holds or desires. The definition doesn\u2019t require \nher to be able to perform her former job; it only asks about \nher ability to perform the functions of a job that she now \n\u201cholds or desires,\u201d which is none.  \nThis simple conclusion\u2014that can perform is logically \nequivalent to not unable to perform\u2014follows from a basic \nprinciple of \u201cclassical logic.\u201d Bethel v. Jefferson, 589 F.2d \n631, 639 n.49 (D.C. Cir. 1978) (reasoning that a plaintiff \nwho wasn\u2019t in a \u201cunit\u201d of government \u201cin the competitive \nservice\u201d necessarily fell under a Title VII provision \ngoverning everyone else). It \u201cholds simply that every \nalternation of a sentence with its negation is true.\u201d Id. \n(quoting Willard Van Orman Quine, Philosophy of Logic \n15, 83\u201387 (1970)).4 \n \n4 This law of double negation comes from the \u201claw of the excluded \nmiddle,\u201d one of Aristotle\u2019s three laws of thought. Irving Copi, \nIntroduction to Logic 372\u201373 (1994). An explanation goes like this: \u201cIf \nyou have a proposition P, either P is true, or P is false; that is, either \nP is true or non-P is true. We cannot have a third possibility. As a \nconsequence of the excluded middle, we have the principle of double \nnegation: Negation of negation is equivalent to affirmation.\u201d Alain \nBadiou, The Three Negations, 29 Cardozo L. Rev. 1877, 1878 (2008).  \n\n- 43 - \n \nC. Reading \u201cqualified individual\u201d in context to \ninclude retirees is consistent with the \nstatutory scheme and avoids creating \nsurplusage and absurd consequences.  \nAs everything above demonstrates, the court of \nappeals\u2019 reading of the \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition is \ncertainly not compelled by the text. But reading the \ndefinition to include retirees isn\u2019t necessarily compelled \nby the text alone, either. The only way to answer the \nquestion is with some context. Indeed, \u201cinterpretation \nalways depends on context.\u201d Scalia & Garner, Reading \nLaw at 63; see Graham Cnty. Soil & Water Conservation \nDist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson, 545 U.S. 409, 415 \n(2005) (\u201cStatutory language has meaning only in \ncontext.\u201d). Ours is the only reading that makes sense of \nthe statutory scheme as a whole.  \n1. The text must be read in context, not in isolation. \nWe concede that some implicitly conditional rules that \nread like the \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition might be \nnaturally read in context as excluding those who can\u2019t \nsatisfy the condition. Others, however, go the other way. \nConsider these two airport security rules: \n(A) \u201cTo get through security, a passenger must \ncomplete an x-ray screening of the baggage that \nsuch individual carries.\u201d Can you get through with \nno bags? \n(B) \u201cTo get through security, a passenger must scan \nthe boarding pass that such individual carries.\u201d Can \nyou get through with no boarding pass?  \nThe syntax is the same. But our inclination is probably \nto say yes to the first question, and no to the second. If you \ndon\u2019t have a boarding pass, you likely won\u2019t get through. \n\n- 44 - \n \nYet we somehow know that the person without bags is in \nthe clear. A gadfly passenger might point out that rule (B) \nliterally only requires scanning a pass \u201cthat such \nindividual carries.\u201d That hyperliteralism likely won\u2019t \npersuade the security officers. But he\u2019d have a point\u2014 the \nrule surely could have been written more clearly to \nexpress that you must have a boarding pass: \u201cNo \nindividual may go through security without a boarding \npass.\u201d \nAs with the airport rules, Congress could have written \nthe \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition to more obviously \ninclude, or exclude, retirees. You might think that \nCongress could have clarified that retirees are covered by \nusing the word \u201cany.\u201d But referring to \u201cany employment \nposition that such individual \u2026 desires\u201d would have been \nawkward and confusing. The point of the restrictive clause \nis to tell us which position a job seeker must qualify for (a \nparticular position), not to suggest any position she might \nwant. So \u201cwe can see why a Congress,\u201d with our reading \nin mind, \u201cmight have chosen\u201d against \u201cany,\u201d despite its \nsurface appeal. Pulsifer, 601 U.S. at 138. The indefinite \narticle \u201can\u201d might have been clearer; but it too would have \ncarried a similar risk of confusion, which may explain why \nthe drafters used \u201cthe.\u201d (They were focused on tying \nqualifications to \u201cthe\u201d position at issue.)  \nEven if Congress had used \u201cany\u201d or \u201can,\u201d though, the \nCity would presumably still be here with the same \narguments. So it\u2019s not clear that even this would have \n\u201cdelivered us from interpretive controversy\u201d and ended \nthe \u201cgrammatical back-and-forth.\u201d Id. On the other hand, \nit would have been easy to clearly exclude retirees: \u201cA \nqualified individual means an individual who holds or \n\n- 45 - \n \ndesires an employment position and who can perform the \nessential functions of that position.\u201d  \nIn any event, conceding that Congress could have \ndrafted the definition more clearly to include retirees \ndoesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s not the right reading. See Gardner \nv. Collins, 27 U.S. 58, 86\u201387 (1829) (Story, J.) (holding that, \nalthough \u201cthe words \u2018if any there be\u2019 [were] omitted\u201d from \none version of the same statute, \u201cthe legislative intention \nin both acts was the same\u201d). This Court does not \u201cdemand \n(or in truth expect) that Congress draft in the most \ntranslucent way possible.\u201d Pulsifer, 601 U.S. at 137.   \u201cThe \nquestion, then, is not: Could Congress have indicated\u201d its \nintent to protect retirees \u201cin more crystalline fashion\u201d? \nTorres v. Lynch, 578 U.S. 452, 472\u201373 (2016). \u201cThe \nquestion is instead, and more simply: Is that the right and \nfair reading of the statute\u201d that Congress actually \nwrote? Id. at 473.   \nUltimately, there\u2019s no single \u201cgrammatical principle\u201d \nthat conclusively answers that question. Pulsifer, 601 U.S. \nat 137. Instead, what each of the examples shows is that \ndeciding whether a rule like this one includes or excludes \nretirees requires considering its \u201ccontent\u201d and \u201ccontext.\u201d \nId. at 138 n.5. \u201c[S]tated in the usual language of statutory \nconstruction, the answer [] lie[s] in considering the \n[definition\u2019s] text in its legal context.\u201d Id. at 141.  \n2. The statutory context makes clear that retirees \nare protected by the ADA.  \nReading the \u201ctext\u201d in \u201ccontext\u201d is how we know that \nretirees are \u201cqualified individual[s].\u201d Id. The definition\u2019s \ntext asks if you \u201ccan\u201d do a job. It asks that question \nbecause the provision\u2019s role is to screen out from the Act\u2019s \nprotections those who can\u2019t perform essential functions of \na job, and whose inclusion would therefore impede the \n\n- 46 - \n \nemployer\u2019s legitimate business prerogatives. See supra \n29\u201331. There\u2019s no \u201cplausible, or even cogent, explanation\u201d \nfor why a definition with this function would exclude \nretirees, who are not asked to perform any essential \nfunctions at all. Pulsifer, 601 U.S. at 148 n.7; see Scalia & \nGarner, Reading Law at 20 (explaining that an \u201cessential \nelement of context that gives meaning to words\u201d is the \n\u201cevident purpose of what a text seeks to achieve\u201d).  \nInterpreting \nthe \ndefinition \nto \ninclude \nformer \nemployees also avoids creating \u201csuperfluity.\u201d Pulsifer, \n601 U.S. at 142. On the court of appeals\u2019 reading, there\u2019s \nno role for the language limiting the reasonable-\naccommodation mandate to a \u201cqualified individual \u2026 who \nis an applicant or employee.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A). \nBy contrast, interpreting \u201cqualified individual\u201d to include \nretirees means that there is no surplusage; this, too, is \nrelevant \u201clegal context.\u201d Pulsifer, 601 U.S. at 141. \nThere\u2019s more. Recognizing that the definition does not \nexclude retirees gives force to the various provisions of the \nAct that protect retirees: Its inclusion of retirement \nbenefits as part and parcel of \u201ccompensation,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 12112(a), and its express allowance for a particular kind \n(but not the kind alleged in this case) of decision-making, \n\u201cbased on underwriting risks, classifying risks, [and] \nadministering such risks,\u201d when \u201cestablishing\u201d or \n\u201cadministering\u201d \u201cbenefit[s] plans,\u201d id. \u00a7 12201(c)(2).  \nThis reading also maintains congruity between the \nADA and Title VII, the statute on which much of Title I \nwas \u201cmodeled.\u201d Barnett, 535 U.S. at 420 (Souter, J., \ndissenting). As this Court made clear in Robinson v. Shell \nOil Co., many of Title VII\u2019s protections apply with full \nforce to \u201cformer employees.\u201d 519 U.S. at 342.  \n\n- 47 - \n \nFinally, \ninterpreting \nthe \n\u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d \ndefinition to include retirees avoids the absurd results that \nthe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s interpretation invites. The court of \nappeals\u2019 view means that employers are free to do the day \nafter retirement what they certainly could not do the day \nbefore. An employer motivated by nothing but raw animus \ncould lawfully strip a former employee who becomes \ndisabled after retiring of their benefits\u2014benefits that the \nstatute protects and that were earned while \u201cperform[ing] \nthe essential functions of the employment position\u201d the \nretiree held. And they could do so while openly stating \nthat the decision was based solely on their preference for \n\u201cnormal\u201d retirees over \u201cdisabled\u201d ones. See Doc. 1 at 12.  \nAn interpretation that allows that result\u2014which the \nEleventh Circuit\u2019s does\u2014would \u201cnegate [the ADA\u2019s] own \nstated purposes.\u201d New York State Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs. v. \nDublino, 413 U.S. 405, 420 (1973). Had Congress made a \ndeliberate choice to adopt that surprising and dramatic \ndeparture from the design of Title VII, it\u2019s hard to believe \nthat it would have done so through the use of present-\ntense verbs in an ambiguous restrictive clause at the end \nof a definitional provision. See Whitman v. Am. Trucking \nAss\u2019ns, 531 U.S. 457, 468 (2001) (\u201cCongress \u2026 does not, \none might say, hide elephants in mouseholes.\u201d). \nThe \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition might, \u201cat first \nblush,\u201d then, allow the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s interpretation. \nRobinson, 519 U.S. at 341. But any confidence in that first \nimpression gives way on a closer look, and resort to the \nordinary tools of statutory construction\u2014text and \u201cthe \nbroader context of\u201d the ADA\u2014all lead to the same \nconclusion: The ADA does not allow employers to freely \ndiscriminate against their former employees.

This information is critical and directly addresses the core legal question, making the task-specific information gain very high. Without the respondent's perspective, any prediction would be one-sided and incomplete. From a design perspective, this action reinforces a fundamental strategy in legal analysis: systematically examining the arguments of both the petitioner and the respondent. While not a novel strategy, confirming the high value of this step helps solidify a core, repeatable workflow for case prediction.

That issue is whether discrimination \noccurring entirely post-employment against totally \ndisabled former employees, is actionable under Title I \nof the ADA. The Eleventh Circuit, joining the majority \nof courts, correctly held that Title I unambiguously \nprohibits discrimination solely against an individual \nwho \u201ccan perform\u201d the job she presently \u201cholds or \ndesires.\u201d Thus, it concluded that because Petitioner \ncould not establish that the City committed any \ndiscriminatory acts against her while she could \nperform the essential functions of a job that she held \nor desired to hold, her Title I claim failed. \nIn Part I of her brief, Petitioner raises an \nargument that she not only failed to press below, but \nthat she expressly disclaimed. She untimely argues \nshe \nwas \ndiscriminated \nagainst \nduring \nher \nemployment when she was a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d \nHowever, she conceded in her initial brief below that \nshe could not have brought these claims while she was \nstill employed and able to do her job because she would \nhave lacked standing. The Eleventh Circuit properly \ndeclined to decide her opposite position untimely \nraised for the first time in her reply brief.  \nThis Court \u201cdoes not \u2018[o]rdinarily...decide in the \nfirst instance issues not decided below.\u2019\u201d City of \nAustin, Texas v. Reagan Nat'l Advert. of Austin, LLC, \n596 U.S. 61, 76 (2022). Therefore, Petitioner\u2019s \ncontention that this Court \u201cneed not reach\u201d the circuit-\nsplit question and should reverse on the issue she \ndisclaimed, should be rejected. This Court should only \n\n2 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nconsider the circuit-split question. But to the extent \nthis Court reviews the question not pressed or passed \nupon, it should find that Petitioner\u2019s unpreserved \nclaims of discrimination during employment are \nunpled and time-barred. The Ledbetter Act has no \nplace here to save her waived claims allegedly \naccruing two decades ago.  \nPetitioner incorrectly claims that the Eleventh \nCircuit held that a disabled retired firefighter may be \nsubjected to discrimination with impunity. It said \nnothing of the sort. And \u201c[i]t seems more than \nuncharitable to say,\u201d Kincaid v. Williams, 143 S. Ct. \n2414, 2418 (2023) (Alito, J., dissenting), that the court \nof appeal\u2019s finding of an unambiguous limitation on \nTitle I\u2019s prohibitions is the same as finding that a \nretiree \u201cmay be subjected to discrimination with \nimpunity.\u201d  \nThe Eleventh Circuit also did not hold that former \nemployees can never sue under Title I regarding post-\nemployment benefits. It held that discrimination \noccurring during employment against a \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d is actionable under the ADA. And for \nalleged discrimination post-employment, there are \nnumerous remedies under other federal and state \nlaws. Thus, Petitioner\u2019s claims failed, not for lack of \nremedy or an incorrect interpretation of the ADA, but \nbecause of her allegations and litigation strategy. This \nCourt should affirm.  \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent statutory provisions are reproduced in \nthe appendix to this brief.  \n\n3 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Statutory Background \n1. In enacting the Americans with Disabilities \nAct, Congress found, in part, that \u201csociety has tended \nto isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(a)(2). Congress enacted Title I of the \nADA to provide legal remedies for discrimination \nagainst disabled workers that did not previously exist. \nSee 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(a)(4). At the time, several other \nfederal statutes existed for the protection of employee \nretirement benefits such as ERISA and the Social \nSecurity Act. The Equal Protection Clause provided an \nadditional remedy for public employees. See Tennessee \nv. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 522 (2004) (\u201cemphasiz[ing] that \nthe House and Senate Committee Reports on the ADA \nfocused on \u2018[d]iscrimination [in]...employment in the \nprivate sector,\u2019 and made no mention of discrimination \nin public employment.\u201d) (emphasis added by the \nCourt). \nThis Court has also \u201cidentified Title I\u2019s purpose as \nenforcement of the Fourteenth Amendment's [equal \nprotection] command that \u2018all persons similarly \nsituated should be treated alike.\u2019\u201d Id. Thus, except as \nto the ADA\u2019s requirement that employers provide \n\u201creasonable accommodations\u201d for the disabled, 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A), the essence of the ADA is \nequal\u2014not preferential\u2014treatment for the disabled. \nSee Williams v. United Ins. Co. of Am., 253 F.3d 280, \n282 (7th Cir. 2001) (an \u201cemployer is not required to \ngive the disabled employee preferential treatment.\u201d). \n\u201cThe ADA requires only that persons with disabilities \nhave the opportunity to receive the same benefits as \nnon-disabled officers who have given an equivalent \n\n4 \n\u0003\n\u0003\namount of service.\u201d Castellano v. City of New York, 142 \nF.3d 58, 70 (2d Cir. 1998). \n2. The ADA\u2019s prohibition against discrimination \nin employment is codified in Title I: \n(a) General rule. No covered entity shall \ndiscriminate \nagainst \na \nqualified \nindividual on the basis of disability in \nregard to job application procedures, \nthe hiring, advancement, or discharge \nof employees, employee compensation, \njob \ntraining, \nand \nother \nterms, \nconditions, \nand \nprivileges \nof \nemployment. \n \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a) (emphasis added). The term of art \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d is incorporated into the general \nrule and defines the class of individuals protected by \nits prohibition against discrimination: \n \nThe term \u201cqualified individual\u201d means an \nindividual \nwho, \nwith \nor \nwithout \nreasonable accommodation, can perform \nthe essential functions of the employment \nposition that such individual holds or \ndesires. \n \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8). \u201cThe determination of whether a \nperson is qualified should be made at the time of the \nemployment action, e.g. hiring or promotion...\u201d H.R. \nRep. No. 101\u2013485(III), at 34 (1990).  \n \n3. While Title I \u201cborrows much of its procedural \nframework from [T]itle VII,\u201d it \u201cborrows much of its \n\n5 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nsubstantive framework from Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973.\u201d Id. at 31. The \u201cconcept\u201d of \na \u201cqualified individual\u201d comes from \u201cthe regulations \nimplementing...the Rehabilitation Act\u201d\u2014not from \nTitle VII. Id. at 33; see also Alexander v. Choate, 469 \nU.S. 287, 309 (1985) (no unlawful discrimination \nfound under the Rehabilitation Act because the state's \npolicy was \u201cneutral on its face\u201d and it \u201cmade the same \nbenefit...equally accessible to both handicapped and \nnonhandicapped persons\u2026\u201d). \nB. Factual Background \n1. Because Petitioner argues that the Eleventh \nCircuit erred in affirming the dismissal of her ADA \nclaim at the pleading stage, the facts should be taken \nfrom her complaint only. Petitioner\u2019s statement of the \nfacts, however, largely draws from the evidence \ndeveloped at the summary judgment stage on her \nEqual Protection Clause claim. The pertinent factual \nallegations from her complaint are as follows.  \nPetitioner alleged that when she was hired in \n1999, the City \u201cpaid for health insurance for its \nemployees who retired after 25 years of service and its \nemployees who retired on account of disability\u201d until \n\u201cthe age of 65.\u201d Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 13, 19. In 2018, she accepted \na disability retirement because she was completely \nunable to perform her duties as a firefighter due to an \nunidentified \u201cphysical disability.\u201d Id. \u00b6 16. \nFifteen years before she retired, the City changed \nits policy in 2003 to require all retirees to complete 25 \nyears\u2019 service to earn the subsidy to age 65. See id. \u00b6\u00b6 \n19, 24. But the change still treated disability retirees \nbetter than similarly situated non-disabled retirees \n\n6 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nwith less than 25 years because while the latter \nreceived nothing, the former received the subsidy for \n24 months or until their receipt of Medicare benefits, \nwhichever came first. Id. \u00b6 24.  \nPetitioner, however, did not sue the City for \nbreach of an employment contract or bring an \nunconstitutional takings claim based on the change. \nThus, Petitioner\u2019s statement that the City \u201cpromised\u201d \nher the benefits under the defunct policy from 15 years \nbefore \nshe \nretired, \nis \nfactually \nand \nlegally \nunsupported. Pet. Br. 11. Petitioner only had a vested \nright to benefits under a policy \u201cin effect at the time\u201d \nof her retirement. City of Hollywood v. Bien, 209 So. \n3d 1, 3 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2016). \nWhile Petitioner claims the policy change was \nmade \u201cquietly,\u201d Pet. Br. 10, her complaint actually \nalleges a public announcement of the policy because it \nwas \u201ccodified in City Policy Section 2.45(c)\u201d of its \nordinances, and in its \u201cofficial personnel policies.\u201d Doc. \n1, \u00b6 24; see also Doc. 38-10 at 2-5; Doc. 38-11 at 4. Her \ncomplaint does not allege that she was unaware of the \npersonnel policy or the ordinance at the time of its \npassage or when she retired.  \nBecause she was totally disabled and unable to \nwork, Petitioner retired early with only 20 years\u2019 \nservice instead of the 25 required to earn the subsidy \nto age 65. Doc. 1, \u00b6 16. Her complaint did not allege \nwhen she became disabled or that she continued to \nwork thereafter as a \u201cqualified individual\u201d with a \ndisability before she retired. Petitioner only alleged \nthat because of a \u201cphysical disability\u201d she took a \ndisability retirement in November 2018 and as a \nresult, the City\u2019s subsidy policy would be applied to \n\n7 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nher, and she would lose the subsidy in November of \n2020\u201424 months after her retirement date. Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 \n16, 26.  \n2. Petitioner erroneously claims that the City\u2019s \nsubsidy \npolicy \ndistinguished \nbetween \n\u201cnormal \nretirees\u201d and disabled retirees. Pet. Br. 11.1 However, \nthe phrase \u201cnormal retiree\u201d appears nowhere in the \nordinance. See Doc. 38-10 at 2-5. Rather, the ordinance \nshows that any retiree, disabled or non-disabled, with \n25 years of service is eligible for the subsidy to age 65. \nDoc. 38-10 at 4, \u00b6 2.45(C), (G). The ordinance did not \ncondition the subsidy to age 65 on a \u201cnormal \nretirement\u201d because under the City\u2019s pension plan, a \n\u201cnormal retirement\u201d could be taken after only ten (10) \nyears of service. Doc. 39-17 at 27; J.A. 35, n. 2.  \nPetitioner, like everyone else, was eligible to \nreceive the full subsidy so long as she served 25 years. \nHowever, in 2018, she requested and was awarded a \n\u201cdisability retirement\u201d with only 20 years of service. \nDoc. 38-5.2 But even though she failed to fulfill the \nservice-based criteria, the City, out of compassion, \nprovided 24 months of the subsidy to its totally \ndisabled retirees who retired early short of 25 years. \nDoc. 38-10 at 4, \u00b6 2.45(C), (F), (G); J.A. 34-35, 40; Doc. \n38 at 21-22. Uncoincidentally, 24 months is exactly \nhow long it takes before a totally disabled retiree like \nPetitioner is eligible to receive Medicare benefits. See \nMedicare Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 426(b)(2)(A), 1395o(a)(1). \n\u0003\n1 Petitioner cites to Doc. 39-16 for this proposition but omits key \nlanguage from that document which shows that the policy was \nbased solely on years of service and not a \u201cnormal\u201d retirement.  \n2 Petitioner insinuates that she was disabled \u201cin the line of duty.\u201d \nPet. Br. 1, 11. The record shows she was not. Doc. 38-5. \n\n8 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nSimilarly situated, non-disabled retirees with only 20 \nyears\u2019 service received no subsidy at all and they are \nnot Medicare eligible because they are not disabled. \nDoc. 38-10 at 4, \u00b6 2.45(C); J.A. 34-35, 44. Thus, far \nfrom treating Petitioner worse because of her \ndisability than her non-disabled co-workers with the \nsame amount of service, she was treated better than \nthem because of her total disability.  \nAlthough the City would have liked to continue \npaying disability retirees with less than 25 years the \nsame subsidy as 25-year retirees, it was forced to cut \ncosts and start treating disability retirees the same as, \nrather than better than, everyone else with less than \n25 years of service. Doc. 38-10 at 2; J.A. 34 n. 1, 40. \nPrior to the 2003 ordinance, the City had the resources \nto pay the subsidy to age 65 for both 25-year retirees \nand \u201cdisability retirees\u201d with less than 25 years. \nHowever, the City was permitted to change that policy \nbefore Petitioner\u2019s rights vested at retirement. Florida \nSheriffs Ass'n v. Dep't of Admin., Div. of Ret., 408 So. \n2d 1033, 1036-37 (Fla. 1981). \nPetitioner claims (at 11) that the City\u2019s HR \nDirector could not explain why the City changed the \nsubsidy policy. He was deposed nearly twenty years \nafter the ordinance was passed and thus his \nknowledge of it was limited to what could be discerned \nfrom the public records. Doc. 39-4 at 1, 10, 80. The \ndistrict court found that the purpose was clearly set \nforth in the ordinance itself and the City articulated \nits legitimate reasons for its service-based policy to \nreward long-term employment, contain costs, and \nprovide compassion for employees who retire early due \nto disability. J.A. 34 n. 1, 40, 45. The City\u2019s policy \n\n9 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nprovided disabled employees access to the same \nbenefits available to all. Doc. 38-10 at 4, \u00b6 2.45(C).  \nC. Procedural Background \n1. The City moved to dismiss Petitioner\u2019s ADA \nclaim because she only alleged post-employment \ndiscrimination when she was no longer a \u201cqualified \nindividual.\u201d Doc. 14 at 4-5. Petitioner did not dispute \nthe City\u2019s characterization of her allegations or argue \nthat her complaint actually alleged discrimination \nduring her employment. See Doc. 17. Petitioner also \ndid not move for leave to amend to add allegations of \ndiscrimination during employment. \nTherefore, \nthe \ndistrict \ncourt \ndismissed \nPetitioner\u2019s ADA claim because she alleged the \n\u201cdiscrimination did not occur until Plaintiff was no \nlonger able to perform the essential functions of her \njob\u201d when she was no longer a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d \nPet. App. 26a. After dismissal, Petitioner did not move \nfor reconsideration arguing the court misapprehended \nany allegations of discrimination during employment.  \nOn her Equal Protection Clause Claim, the \ndistrict court found the policy drew \u201cneutral\u201d lines \nbased on service requiring all retirees to serve 25 \nyears to earn the subsidy to age 65. J.A. 44-45. \n2. Petitioner\u2019s initial brief in the Eleventh Circuit \nconfirmed that her complaint only alleged post-\nemployment discrimination because she argued she \n\u201ccould not have brought these claims while she was \nstill employed\u201d because \u201cshe would have lacked \nstanding.\u201d Pet. C.A. Br. 22. The Eleventh Circuit \ntherefore refused to pass upon this issue expressly \n\n10 \n\u0003\n\u0003\ndisclaimed \nin \nher \ninitial \nbrief \nand \nuntimely \ncontradicted in her reply brief. Pet. App. 17a.  \nNext, the Eleventh Circuit analyzed whether the \nCity\u2019s post-employment application of the subsidy \npolicy was, in its own right, a fresh violation of Title I, \nrather \nthan \nan \nalleged \nextension \nof \npast \ndiscrimination. Pet. App. 16a. In doing so, it found \nthat nothing in the Ledbetter Act \u201cchanges Title I\u2019s \nsubstantive requirements,\u201d including the requirement \nthat one be a \u201cqualified individual\u201d at the time of the \ndiscriminatory act. Pet. App. 15a. It held the \nLedbetter Act\u2019s \u201crelaxed statute of limitations helps a \nplaintiff only if that plaintiff otherwise has a claim for \ndiscrimination.\u201d Id.  \nTher\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n6: 20241112164103052_23-99720AOS.json (score: 0.399)\nAFFIDAVIT OF SERVICE \n \nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES \n \nNo. 23-997 \n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------X \n \nKARYN D.

That issue is whether discrimination \noccurring entirely post-employment against totally \ndisabled former employees, is actionable under Title I \nof the ADA. The Eleventh Circuit, joining the majority \nof courts, correctly held that Title I unambiguously \nprohibits discrimination solely against an individual \nwho \u201ccan perform\u201d the job she presently \u201cholds or \ndesires.\u201d Thus, it concluded that because Petitioner \ncould not establish that the City committed any \ndiscriminatory acts against her while she could \nperform the essential functions of a job that she held \nor desired to hold, her Title I claim failed. \nIn Part I of her brief, Petitioner raises an \nargument that she not only failed to press below, but \nthat she expressly disclaimed. She untimely argues \nshe \nwas \ndiscriminated \nagainst \nduring \nher \nemployment when she was a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d \nHowever, she conceded in her initial brief below that \nshe could not have brought these claims while she was \nstill employed and able to do her job because she would \nhave lacked standing. The Eleventh Circuit properly \ndeclined to decide her opposite position untimely \nraised for the first time in her reply brief.  \nThis Court \u201cdoes not \u2018[o]rdinarily...decide in the \nfirst instance issues not decided below.\u2019\u201d City of \nAustin, Texas v. Reagan Nat'l Advert. of Austin, LLC, \n596 U.S. 61, 76 (2022). Therefore, Petitioner\u2019s \ncontention that this Court \u201cneed not reach\u201d the circuit-\nsplit question and should reverse on the issue she \ndisclaimed, should be rejected. This Court should only \n\n2 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nconsider the circuit-split question. But to the extent \nthis Court reviews the question not pressed or passed \nupon, it should find that Petitioner\u2019s unpreserved \nclaims of discrimination during employment are \nunpled and time-barred. The Ledbetter Act has no \nplace here to save her waived claims allegedly \naccruing two decades ago.  \nPetitioner incorrectly claims that the Eleventh \nCircuit held that a disabled retired firefighter may be \nsubjected to discrimination with impunity. It said \nnothing of the sort. And \u201c[i]t seems more than \nuncharitable to say,\u201d Kincaid v. Williams, 143 S. Ct. \n2414, 2418 (2023) (Alito, J., dissenting), that the court \nof appeal\u2019s finding of an unambiguous limitation on \nTitle I\u2019s prohibitions is the same as finding that a \nretiree \u201cmay be subjected to discrimination with \nimpunity.\u201d  \nThe Eleventh Circuit also did not hold that former \nemployees can never sue under Title I regarding post-\nemployment benefits. It held that discrimination \noccurring during employment against a \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d is actionable under the ADA. And for \nalleged discrimination post-employment, there are \nnumerous remedies under other federal and state \nlaws. Thus, Petitioner\u2019s claims failed, not for lack of \nremedy or an incorrect interpretation of the ADA, but \nbecause of her allegations and litigation strategy. This \nCourt should affirm.  \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent statutory provisions are reproduced in \nthe appendix to this brief.  \n\n3 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Statutory Background \n1. In enacting the Americans with Disabilities \nAct, Congress found, in part, that \u201csociety has tended \nto isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(a)(2). Congress enacted Title I of the \nADA to provide legal remedies for discrimination \nagainst disabled workers that did not previously exist. \nSee 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(a)(4). At the time, several other \nfederal statutes existed for the protection of employee \nretirement benefits such as ERISA and the Social \nSecurity Act. The Equal Protection Clause provided an \nadditional remedy for public employees. See Tennessee \nv. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 522 (2004) (\u201cemphasiz[ing] that \nthe House and Senate Committee Reports on the ADA \nfocused on \u2018[d]iscrimination [in]...employment in the \nprivate sector,\u2019 and made no mention of discrimination \nin public employment.\u201d) (emphasis added by the \nCourt). \nThis Court has also \u201cidentified Title I\u2019s purpose as \nenforcement of the Fourteenth Amendment's [equal \nprotection] command that \u2018all persons similarly \nsituated should be treated alike.\u2019\u201d Id. Thus, except as \nto the ADA\u2019s requirement that employers provide \n\u201creasonable accommodations\u201d for the disabled, 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A), the essence of the ADA is \nequal\u2014not preferential\u2014treatment for the disabled. \nSee Williams v. United Ins. Co. of Am., 253 F.3d 280, \n282 (7th Cir. 2001) (an \u201cemployer is not required to \ngive the disabled employee preferential treatment.\u201d). \n\u201cThe ADA requires only that persons with disabilities \nhave the opportunity to receive the same benefits as \nnon-disabled officers who have given an equivalent \n\n4 \n\u0003\n\u0003\namount of service.\u201d Castellano v. City of New York, 142 \nF.3d 58, 70 (2d Cir. 1998). \n2. The ADA\u2019s prohibition against discrimination \nin employment is codified in Title I: \n(a) General rule. No covered entity shall \ndiscriminate \nagainst \na \nqualified \nindividual on the basis of disability in \nregard to job application procedures, \nthe hiring, advancement, or discharge \nof employees, employee compensation, \njob \ntraining, \nand \nother \nterms, \nconditions, \nand \nprivileges \nof \nemployment. \n \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a) (emphasis added). The term of art \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d is incorporated into the general \nrule and defines the class of individuals protected by \nits prohibition against discrimination: \n \nThe term \u201cqualified individual\u201d means an \nindividual \nwho, \nwith \nor \nwithout \nreasonable accommodation, can perform \nthe essential functions of the employment \nposition that such individual holds or \ndesires. \n \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8). \u201cThe determination of whether a \nperson is qualified should be made at the time of the \nemployment action, e.g. hiring or promotion...\u201d H.R. \nRep. No. 101\u2013485(III), at 34 (1990).  \n \n3. While Title I \u201cborrows much of its procedural \nframework from [T]itle VII,\u201d it \u201cborrows much of its \n\n5 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nsubstantive framework from Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973.\u201d Id. at 31. The \u201cconcept\u201d of \na \u201cqualified individual\u201d comes from \u201cthe regulations \nimplementing...the Rehabilitation Act\u201d\u2014not from \nTitle VII. Id. at 33; see also Alexander v. Choate, 469 \nU.S. 287, 309 (1985) (no unlawful discrimination \nfound under the Rehabilitation Act because the state's \npolicy was \u201cneutral on its face\u201d and it \u201cmade the same \nbenefit...equally accessible to both handicapped and \nnonhandicapped persons\u2026\u201d). \nB. Factual Background \n1. Because Petitioner argues that the Eleventh \nCircuit erred in affirming the dismissal of her ADA \nclaim at the pleading stage, the facts should be taken \nfrom her complaint only. Petitioner\u2019s statement of the \nfacts, however, largely draws from the evidence \ndeveloped at the summary judgment stage on her \nEqual Protection Clause claim. The pertinent factual \nallegations from her complaint are as follows.  \nPetitioner alleged that when she was hired in \n1999, the City \u201cpaid for health insurance for its \nemployees who retired after 25 years of service and its \nemployees who retired on account of disability\u201d until \n\u201cthe age of 65.\u201d Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 13, 19. In 2018, she accepted \na disability retirement because she was completely \nunable to perform her duties as a firefighter due to an \nunidentified \u201cphysical disability.\u201d Id. \u00b6 16. \nFifteen years before she retired, the City changed \nits policy in 2003 to require all retirees to complete 25 \nyears\u2019 service to earn the subsidy to age 65. See id. \u00b6\u00b6 \n19, 24. But the change still treated disability retirees \nbetter than similarly situated non-disabled retirees \n\n6 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nwith less than 25 years because while the latter \nreceived nothing, the former received the subsidy for \n24 months or until their receipt of Medicare benefits, \nwhichever came first. Id. \u00b6 24.  \nPetitioner, however, did not sue the City for \nbreach of an employment contract or bring an \nunconstitutional takings claim based on the change. \nThus, Petitioner\u2019s statement that the City \u201cpromised\u201d \nher the benefits under the defunct policy from 15 years \nbefore \nshe \nretired, \nis \nfactually \nand \nlegally \nunsupported. Pet. Br. 11. Petitioner only had a vested \nright to benefits under a policy \u201cin effect at the time\u201d \nof her retirement. City of Hollywood v. Bien, 209 So. \n3d 1, 3 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2016). \nWhile Petitioner claims the policy change was \nmade \u201cquietly,\u201d Pet. Br. 10, her complaint actually \nalleges a public announcement of the policy because it \nwas \u201ccodified in City Policy Section 2.45(c)\u201d of its \nordinances, and in its \u201cofficial personnel policies.\u201d Doc. \n1, \u00b6 24; see also Doc. 38-10 at 2-5; Doc. 38-11 at 4. Her \ncomplaint does not allege that she was unaware of the \npersonnel policy or the ordinance at the time of its \npassage or when she retired.  \nBecause she was totally disabled and unable to \nwork, Petitioner retired early with only 20 years\u2019 \nservice instead of the 25 required to earn the subsidy \nto age 65. Doc. 1, \u00b6 16. Her complaint did not allege \nwhen she became disabled or that she continued to \nwork thereafter as a \u201cqualified individual\u201d with a \ndisability before she retired. Petitioner only alleged \nthat because of a \u201cphysical disability\u201d she took a \ndisability retirement in November 2018 and as a \nresult, the City\u2019s subsidy policy would be applied to \n\n7 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nher, and she would lose the subsidy in November of \n2020\u201424 months after her retirement date. Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 \n16, 26.  \n2. Petitioner erroneously claims that the City\u2019s \nsubsidy \npolicy \ndistinguished \nbetween \n\u201cnormal \nretirees\u201d and disabled retirees. Pet. Br. 11.1 However, \nthe phrase \u201cnormal retiree\u201d appears nowhere in the \nordinance. See Doc. 38-10 at 2-5. Rather, the ordinance \nshows that any retiree, disabled or non-disabled, with \n25 years of service is eligible for the subsidy to age 65. \nDoc. 38-10 at 4, \u00b6 2.45(C), (G). The ordinance did not \ncondition the subsidy to age 65 on a \u201cnormal \nretirement\u201d because under the City\u2019s pension plan, a \n\u201cnormal retirement\u201d could be taken after only ten (10) \nyears of service. Doc. 39-17 at 27; J.A. 35, n. 2.  \nPetitioner, like everyone else, was eligible to \nreceive the full subsidy so long as she served 25 years. \nHowever, in 2018, she requested and was awarded a \n\u201cdisability retirement\u201d with only 20 years of service. \nDoc. 38-5.2 But even though she failed to fulfill the \nservice-based criteria, the City, out of compassion, \nprovided 24 months of the subsidy to its totally \ndisabled retirees who retired early short of 25 years. \nDoc. 38-10 at 4, \u00b6 2.45(C), (F), (G); J.A. 34-35, 40; Doc. \n38 at 21-22. Uncoincidentally, 24 months is exactly \nhow long it takes before a totally disabled retiree like \nPetitioner is eligible to receive Medicare benefits. See \nMedicare Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 426(b)(2)(A), 1395o(a)(1). \n\u0003\n1 Petitioner cites to Doc. 39-16 for this proposition but omits key \nlanguage from that document which shows that the policy was \nbased solely on years of service and not a \u201cnormal\u201d retirement.  \n2 Petitioner insinuates that she was disabled \u201cin the line of duty.\u201d \nPet. Br. 1, 11. The record shows she was not. Doc. 38-5. \n\n8 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nSimilarly situated, non-disabled retirees with only 20 \nyears\u2019 service received no subsidy at all and they are \nnot Medicare eligible because they are not disabled. \nDoc. 38-10 at 4, \u00b6 2.45(C); J.A. 34-35, 44. Thus, far \nfrom treating Petitioner worse because of her \ndisability than her non-disabled co-workers with the \nsame amount of service, she was treated better than \nthem because of her total disability.  \nAlthough the City would have liked to continue \npaying disability retirees with less than 25 years the \nsame subsidy as 25-year retirees, it was forced to cut \ncosts and start treating disability retirees the same as, \nrather than better than, everyone else with less than \n25 years of service. Doc. 38-10 at 2; J.A. 34 n. 1, 40. \nPrior to the 2003 ordinance, the City had the resources \nto pay the subsidy to age 65 for both 25-year retirees \nand \u201cdisability retirees\u201d with less than 25 years. \nHowever, the City was permitted to change that policy \nbefore Petitioner\u2019s rights vested at retirement. Florida \nSheriffs Ass'n v. Dep't of Admin., Div. of Ret., 408 So. \n2d 1033, 1036-37 (Fla. 1981). \nPetitioner claims (at 11) that the City\u2019s HR \nDirector could not explain why the City changed the \nsubsidy policy. He was deposed nearly twenty years \nafter the ordinance was passed and thus his \nknowledge of it was limited to what could be discerned \nfrom the public records. Doc. 39-4 at 1, 10, 80. The \ndistrict court found that the purpose was clearly set \nforth in the ordinance itself and the City articulated \nits legitimate reasons for its service-based policy to \nreward long-term employment, contain costs, and \nprovide compassion for employees who retire early due \nto disability. J.A. 34 n. 1, 40, 45. The City\u2019s policy \n\n9 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nprovided disabled employees access to the same \nbenefits available to all. Doc. 38-10 at 4, \u00b6 2.45(C).  \nC. Procedural Background \n1. The City moved to dismiss Petitioner\u2019s ADA \nclaim because she only alleged post-employment \ndiscrimination when she was no longer a \u201cqualified \nindividual.\u201d Doc. 14 at 4-5. Petitioner did not dispute \nthe City\u2019s characterization of her allegations or argue \nthat her complaint actually alleged discrimination \nduring her employment. See Doc. 17. Petitioner also \ndid not move for leave to amend to add allegations of \ndiscrimination during employment. \nTherefore, \nthe \ndistrict \ncourt \ndismissed \nPetitioner\u2019s ADA claim because she alleged the \n\u201cdiscrimination did not occur until Plaintiff was no \nlonger able to perform the essential functions of her \njob\u201d when she was no longer a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d \nPet. App. 26a. After dismissal, Petitioner did not move \nfor reconsideration arguing the court misapprehended \nany allegations of discrimination during employment.  \nOn her Equal Protection Clause Claim, the \ndistrict court found the policy drew \u201cneutral\u201d lines \nbased on service requiring all retirees to serve 25 \nyears to earn the subsidy to age 65. J.A. 44-45. \n2. Petitioner\u2019s initial brief in the Eleventh Circuit \nconfirmed that her complaint only alleged post-\nemployment discrimination because she argued she \n\u201ccould not have brought these claims while she was \nstill employed\u201d because \u201cshe would have lacked \nstanding.\u201d Pet. C.A. Br. 22. The Eleventh Circuit \ntherefore refused to pass upon this issue expressly \n\n10 \n\u0003\n\u0003\ndisclaimed \nin \nher \ninitial \nbrief \nand \nuntimely \ncontradicted in her reply brief. Pet. App. 17a.  \nNext, the Eleventh Circuit analyzed whether the \nCity\u2019s post-employment application of the subsidy \npolicy was, in its own right, a fresh violation of Title I, \nrather \nthan \nan \nalleged \nextension \nof \npast \ndiscrimination. Pet. App. 16a. In doing so, it found \nthat nothing in the Ledbetter Act \u201cchanges Title I\u2019s \nsubstantive requirements,\u201d including the requirement \nthat one be a \u201cqualified individual\u201d at the time of the \ndiscriminatory act. Pet. App. 15a. It held the \nLedbetter Act\u2019s \u201crelaxed statute of limitations helps a \nplaintiff only if that plaintiff otherwise has a claim for \ndiscrimination.\u201d Id.  \nTherefore, it adhered to its precedent holding that \nTitle I is unambiguous and contains a \u201cclear temporal \nqualifier\u201d stating \u201c[o]nly someone \u2018who, with or \nwithout reasonable accommodation, can perform the \nessential functions of the employment position that \nsuch individual holds or desires\u201d is protected from \ndisability discrimination. Pet. App. 11a (emphasis in \noriginal). It concluded that \u201c[b]ecause Stanley cannot \nestablish that the City committed any discriminatory \nacts against her while she could perform the essential \nfunctions of a job that she held or desired to hold, her \nTitle I claim fails.\u201d Pet. App. 18a. \n\u0003\n \n\n11 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI. Part I of Petitioner\u2019s brief is unrelated to the \ncircuit-split question upon which this Court granted \ncertiorari regarding whether discrimination occurring \nentirely post-employment is actionable under the \nADA. Instead, Part I seeks review of a different \nquestion regarding whether Petitioner sufficiently \nalleged discrimination during her employment as a \n\u201cqualified individual.\u201d Petitioner argues her ADA \nclaim allegedly accrued in 2003 when the City passed \nits subsidy policy. She admits she was not disabled at \nthat time but argues Title I did not require her to have \na disability to sue for disability discrimination. She \nheavily relies on the minimal standing requirements \nin the enforcement provisions of Title I and Title VII. \nBut Title I\u2019s enforcement provision only applies to \n\u201cany person alleging discrimination on the basis of \ndisability in violation of any provision of this chapter.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12117(a) (emphasis added). This is a \n\u201ccross-reference\u2026directing us to a class of claims with \na settled and statutorily precise meaning.\u201d Almond v. \nUnified Sch. Dist. No. 501, 665 F.3d 1174, 1181 (10th \nCir. 2011).  \nThe ADA\u2019s \u201cclass of claims\u201d are found in its \nsubstantive anti-discrimination provision, \u00a7 12112(a), \nwhich has a settled meaning requiring Petitioner to \nshow: \u201c(1) that she was disabled under the ADA; (2) \nthat she was a qualified individual with a disability; \nand (3) that she was discriminated against by her \nemployer because of that disability.\u201d Dunlap v. Liberty \nNat. Prod., Inc., 878 F.3d 794, 798\u201399 (9th Cir. 2017). \nBecause Petitioner conceded that she did not have a \ndisability in 2003 and further conceded that she \n\n12 \n\u0003\n\u0003\n\u201clacked standing\u201d to sue for anything occurring \u201cwhile \nshe was still employed,\u201d Pet. C.A. Br. 22, the Eleventh \nCircuit correctly declined to pass upon whether her \nallegations sufficiently alleged she was discriminated \nagainst as a \u201cqualified individual\u201d at any time before \nshe retired.  Pet. App. 17a. \nThe Eleventh Circuit also correctly held that the \nLedbetter Act did not change Title I\u2019s substantive \nrequirement that she be a \u201cqualified individual\u201d with \na disability at the time of the alleged discrimination. \nId. 15a. Because she only alleged discrimination \noccurring entirely post-employment when she could no \nlonger perform the essential functions of her job, she \nwas not a \u201cqualified individual\u201d entitled to sue.  \nII. The Eleventh Circuit correctly held that Title \nI\u2019s use of the present tense unambiguously prohibits \ndiscrimination solely against an individual who \u201ccan \nperform\u201d the job she presently \u201cholds or desires.\u201d Id. \n11a-12a. This reading is consistent with the ADA\u2019s \nstatutory scheme which uses the term \u201cindividuals\u201d to \nbroadly include former employees, but \u201cqualified \nindividuals\u201d to refer only to current employees. And it \ngives effect to every word in the definition and the \ngeneral rule where it appears.  \nPetitioner\u2019s interpretation requires this Court to \nrewrite Title I to include an exception to the \u201ccan \nperform\u201d clause for retirees. It is based on a policy \npreference to avoid what she perceives as an \u201cabsurd\u201d \nconsequence of the express line drawn by Congress. \nHowever, \u201cCongress could reasonably decide to enable \ndisabled people who can work with reasonable \naccommodation to get and keep jobs, without also \ndeciding to equalize post-employment fringe benefits \n\n13 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nfor people who cannot work.\u201d Weyer v. Twentieth \nCentury Fox Film Corp., 198 F.3d 1104, 1112 (9th Cir. \n2000). The Eleventh Circuit correctly refused to allow \npolicy preference or purpose\u2014even purpose as most \nnarrowly defined\u2014to negate the plain language of the \nstatute.  \nARGUMENT \nThe question presented, as inaccurately framed \nby Petitioner, asks under the ADA, \u201cdoes a former \nemployee\u2014who was qualified to perform her job and \nwho \nearned \npost-employment \nbenefits \nwhile \nemployed\u2014lose her right to sue over discrimination \nwith respect to those benefits solely because she no \nlonger holds her job?\u201d Pet. Br. i. A former employee \nwho has a \u201cright to sue\u201d cannot \u201close\u201d that right \n\u201csolely\u201d because she no longer holds her job. If so, there \ncould be no ADA claim for a discriminatory \ntermination\u2014a claim the Eleventh Circuit has \npermitted former employees to bring. See Taylor v. \nFood World, Inc., 133 F.3d 1419 (11th Cir. 1998).  \nThe Eleventh Circuit held that to \u201cfall within Title \nI\u2019s anti-discrimination provision, a plaintiff\u2019s claim \nmust depend on an act committed by the defendant \nwhile the plaintiff was either working for the \ndefendant or seeking to work for the defendant.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 8a-9a. This holding clearly makes room for \nformer employees to sue if they were discriminated \nagainst during their employment. Because the \nEleventh Circuit did not hold that former employees \nare categorically barred from suing under the ADA, \nPetitioner is not entitled to a reversal based on a \nruling that was never made.  \n\n14 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nThe \ncircuit-split \nquestion \nis \nwhether \ndiscrimination occurring entirely post-employment \nagainst \ntotally \ndisabled \nformer \nemployees, \nis \nactionable under Title I. The Eleventh Circuit, siding \nwith the majority, held that \u201c[b]ecause Stanley cannot \nestablish that the City committed any discriminatory \nacts against her while she could perform the essential \nfunctions of a job that she held or desired to hold, her \nTitle I claim fails.\u201d Pet. App. 18a.  \nTherefore, Part I of Petitioner\u2019s brief framing the \nissue as whether \u201c[t]he ADA permits former \nemployees to bring suit with respect to post-\nemployment benefits,\u201d attacks a strawman. Pet. Br. \n17. As the Eleventh Circuit never categorically barred \nsuch suits, Petitioner reveals the real alleged errors \nfor this Court\u2019s review deep into Part I(C)(2). Id. 24-\n27. In doing so, she has \u201csmuggl[ed] additional \nquestions into\u201d the case \u201cafter [this Court] grant[ed] \ncertiorari.\u201d Irvine v. People of California, 347 U.S. 128, \n129 (1954).  \nCompletely unrelated to the circuit-split question \nregarding whether post-employment discrimination \nagainst former employees is actionable under Title I, \nPetitioner argues the Eleventh Circuit erred by: (1) \nfinding that she disclaimed standing to sue for \ndiscrimination occurring during her employment, Pet. \nBr. 24, 27; (2) misapplying Title I\u2019s \u201cdisability\u201d \nelement to the facts of this case, Id. 25; and (3) not \napplying the Ledbetter Act to find her time-barred \nclaims allegedly accruing during employment \u201cre-\naccrued in 2020,\u201d Id. 24.  \nNone \nof \nthese \nquestions \nare \n\u201csubsidiary \nquestion[s] fairly included\u201d in the circuit-split \n\n15 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nquestion. Yee v. City of Escondido, Cal., 503 U.S. 519, \n535 (1992). Instead, Petitioner has relegated the \ncircuit-split question to her secondary argument for \nreversal. Pet. Br., Part II, 27. Remarkably, she argues \nthat this Court \u201cneed not even reach\u201d the circuit-split \nquestion and should reverse based solely on the above \nthree alleged misapplications of law to fact. Pet. Br. \n17. This is backwards. This Court should ignore Part \nI and proceed solely to resolving the circuit-split \nquestion in Part II. But to the extent this Court \nreviews Part I, it should find that she waived these \narguments, and any claim of discrimination during \nemployment is unpled and time-barred. \nI. \nThe Non-Circuit-Split Questions Regarding \nDiscrimination During Employment \nIn support of her argument of discrimination \nduring employment when she was a \u201cqualified \nindividual,\u201d Petitioner provides a truncated version of \nTitle I\u2019s enforcement and substantive provisions \nomitting crucial elements under \u00a7 12112(a). Pet. Br. \n17-23. She argues merely pleading that she was \n\u201caggrieved\u201d regarding her post-employment benefits, \nwith the aid of the Ledbetter Act, brings her \u201cclaim \nacross the finish line.\u201d Pet. Br. 21.  \nHer claim, however, never got off the starting \nblocks because she expressly disclaimed standing to \nsue for anything occurring during her employment. \nPet. C.A. Br. 22. To be sure, her initial brief in the \nEleventh Circuit argued: \nMs. Stanley could not have brought these \nclaims while she was still employed and able \nto do her job because she had not yet learned \n\n16 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nof the discrimination and become a disability \nretiree impacted by the discrimination so she \nwould have lacked standing. \nId. (emphasis added). Even in the absence of this \ndisclaimer, her complaint failed to demonstrate that a \nTitle I claim accrued during her employment or that \nany such claim was timely. Determining the \ntimeliness of Petitioner\u2019s 2019 EEOC charge required \nher \u201cto identify precisely the \u2018unlawful employment \npractice\u2019 of which\u201d she complains. Delaware State Coll. \nv. Ricks, 449 U.S. 250, 257 (1980).  \nPetitioner argues her claims accrued during her \nemployment: (1) in 2003 when the City adopted its \nsubsidy policy; (2) when she became disabled during \nemployment; and (3) at some unspecified time when it \nbecame \u201cinevitable\u201d that she would need to take a \ndisability retirement prior to her retirement on \nNovember 1, 2018. Pet. Br. 24-26. These arguments \ncannot be squared with the allegations of the \ncomplaint. And Petitioner has waived them.  \nA. Petitioner disclaimed and her complaint \nfailed to demonstrate any claim accrued \nin 2003 when the City adopted its \nsubsidy policy.  \n1. \nThe \nEleventh \nCircuit \nfound \nPetitioner \n\u201cconcedes, and we agree, that her claim cannot turn on \nthe 2003 amendment to the benefits plan because she \nwas not yet disabled at that time.\u201d Pet. App. 16a. \nPetitioner admitted in her initial brief that the City \nadopted its subsidy policy \u201cin 2003, when Ms. Stanley \nwas a non-disabled employee.\u201d Pet. C.A. Br. 22 n. 5. \nShe then conceded she \u201clacked standing\u201d to bring \n\n17 \n\u0003\n\u0003\n\u201cthese claims while she was still employed and able to \ndo her job\u201d because she was not yet a \u201cdisability retiree \nimpacted by the discrimination.\u201d Pet. C.A. Br. 22 \n(emphasis added). Although Petitioner purported to \nincorporate the United States\u2019 contrary arguments \ninto her initial brief, Pet. C.A. Br. 20, the Eleventh \nCircuit was not required to scour the amicus brief for \nbetter arguments to save Petitioner\u2019s case. The \nEleventh Circuit properly relied on her arguments in \nher brief expressly disclaiming standing to sue for \nanything during her employment.  \nPetitioner and the United States attempt to \nexplain away her concessions by arguing she only \nmeant to disclaim any financial impact during her \nemployment. Pet. Br. 27; U.S. Am. Br. 27-28. This \nargument cannot be squared with her clear concession \nthat she \u201clacked standing\u201d to sue \u201cwhile she was still \nemployed.\u201d Pet. C.A. Br. 22. Indeed, financial impact \nis not necessary for standing, but an injury is. Her way \nof describing \u201cinjury\u201d was by using the word \u201cimpact\u201d \nbecause otherwise she would not have disclaimed \nstanding simply because she suffered no financial \nimpact during employment.  \nIt is true that this Court\u2019s \u201cpractice \u2018permit[s] \nreview of an issue not pressed [below] so long as it has \nbeen passed upon.\u2019\u201d Citizens United v. Fed. Election \nComm'n, 558 U.S. 310, 330 (2010). To the extent that \nthe Eleventh Circuit passed upon this issue by \n\u201cagree[ing]\u201d with Petitioner's concession that \u201cher \nclaim cannot turn on the 2003\u201d adoption of the policy, \nPet. App. 16a, prudential concerns weigh in favor of \nthis Court declining to review this matter. A mere \nfailure to \u201cpress\u201d an argument is markedly different \n\n18 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nthan an express disclaimer of an argument because \nthe latter invites the complained-of error. See City of \nSpringfield, Mass. v. Kibbe, 480 U.S. 257, 259 \n(1987) (rejecting argument \u201cthat we need not concern \nourselves about Springfield's failure to preserve this \nissue, because it was passed on by the Court of \nAppeals\u201d because \u201cthere would be considerable \nprudential objection to reversing a judgment because \nof instructions that petitioner accepted, and indeed \nitself requested.\u201d).  \nFurther, while an appellant can raise on appeal \nany new \u201cargument\u201d in support of a \u201cclaim,\u201d U.S. \nAmicus Br. 28 n. 6, it cannot wait until its reply brief \nto flip-flop on a position in true ambush fashion as \nPetitioner did here. Compare Pet. C.A. Br. 22 with Pet. \nC.A. Reply Br. 5. This Court should hold that because \nPetitioner \u201craised this issue for the first time in [her] \nreply \nbrief,\u201d \nshe \n\u201chas \nwaived \nthis \nclaim.\u201d \nUnited States v. Dicter, 198 F.3d 1284, 1289 (11th Cir. \n1999). \n2. Even if Petitioner hadn\u2019t expressly disclaimed \nthe argument below, her allegations were still \ninsufficient to demonstrate that a claim accrued in \n2003. Although she concedes she was not disabled \nthen, she incorrectly argues she was not required to \nhave a disability at that time to bring suit. Pet. Br. 25.  \nTitle I\u2019s enforcement provision, \u00a7 12117(a), \nincorporates Title VII\u2019s remedial framework which \nstates any \u201cperson claiming to be aggrieved\u201d can bring \n\u201ca civil action.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1). This Court \nhas held that \u201caggrieved\u201d in Title VII \u201cenabl[es] suit \nby any plaintiff with an interest arguably [sought] to \nbe protected by the statute...while excluding plaintiffs \n\n19 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nwho might technically be injured in an Article III \nsense but whose interests are unrelated to the \nstatutory prohibitions in Title VII.\u201d Thompson v. N. \nAm. Stainless, LP, 562 U.S. 170, 178 (2011) (internal \nquotation \nmarks \nand \ncitation \nomitted). \nPut \ndifferently, the requirement that the plaintiff be \n\u201caggrieved\u201d is a requirement that the plaintiff have \n\u201cstatutory\u201d standing to sue. Id. at 177-78. \nBut, here, Petitioner failed to allege Article III or \nstatutory standing to sue in 2003. Her claim is based \non \u201cher disability.\u201d Doc. 1, \u00b6 26. And yet, she was not \ndisabled in 2003 and therefore not injured by a policy \nthat allegedly discriminated only against the disabled. \nSee Bostock v. Clayton Cnty., Georgia, 590 U.S. 644, \n681 \n(2020) \n(\u201cDiscriminate \nagainst\u201d \nmeans \n\u201cdistinctions or differences in treatment that injure \nprotected individuals.\u201d).  \nHer claim was not based on the disability of \nsomeone else with whom she associated under \u00a7 \n12112(b)(4), nor was it based on a claim that she was \nmerely \u201cregarded as\u201d disabled under \u00a7 12102(1)(C). \nSee Murray v. Warren Pumps, LLC, 821 F.3d 77, 83 \n(1st Cir. 2016) (a plaintiff must prove her \u201cparticular \ntheory of disability discrimination alleged.\u201d). Based on \nPetitioner\u2019s particular theory in her complaint, she \nwas required to show that she was discriminated \nagainst because of her disability \u201cwhich requires that \nthe disability exist at the time of the discrimination.\u201d \nWeyer, 198 F.3d at 1112.  \nPetitioner argues that the ADAAA of 2008 \nrepealed any requirement that she have a disability to \nsue for a claim allegedly accruing in 2003. Pet. Br. 25. \nThe ADAAA amended \u00a7 12112(a) to prohibit \n\n20 \n\u0003\n\u0003\ndiscrimination \u201cagainst a qualified individual on the \nbasis of disability\u201d rather than \u201cagainst a qualified \nindividual with a disability because of the disability.\u201d \nPub. L. No. 110-325, \u00a7 5(a)(1), 122 Stat. 3557 (2008) \n(emphasis added). However, the Eleventh Circuit and \nits \u201csister circuits...hold that the switch from \u2018because \nof\u2019 to \u2018on the basis of\u2019 in the 2008 amendment to the \nADA did not change or affect its but-for causation \nstandard.\u201d Akridge v. Alfa Ins. Companies, 93 F.4th \n1181, 1192 (11th Cir. 2024). \nThis \namendment \nremoved \nthe \nredundant \nlanguage, \u201cwith a disability because of the disability\u201d \nfrom \u00a7 12112(a) because those words were already \nrepeated several times in the \u201cconstruction\u201d provision, \n\u00a7 12112(b). Section 12112(b)(1), for example, still \nprohibits \n\u201cclassifying \na \njob \napplicant \nor \nemployee...because of the disability of such applicant \nor employee.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(1) (emphasis \nadded). \nThe express purpose of the ADAAA was to \u201creject\u201d \ndecisions of this Court, which Congress found \ninterpreted the definition of a \u201cdisability\u201d too \nnarrowly. Pub. L. No. 110-325, \u00a7 2(b). Congress stated \nthe amendment\u2019s purpose was to clarify \u201cthat the \nquestion of whether an individual's impairment is a \ndisability under the ADA should not demand \nextensive analysis.\u201d Id. at \u00a7 2(b)(5). Therefore, the \nchanges removed the prior emphasis on whether an \nindividual\u2019s impairment met the definition of a \n\u201cdisability.\u201d Congress did not remove the requirement \nthat an individual have a disability all together. \n3. Even if the ADAAA did dispense with the \n\u201cdisability\u201d element, the United States acknowledges \n\n21 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nthat the \u201cADAAA\u2019s amendments...apply to claims that \narose after\u201d January 1, 2009. U.S. Amicus Br. 24 n. 4. \nTherefore, any claim allegedly accruing in 2003 would \nbe governed by the ADA, before the ADAAA allegedly \ndisposed of the disability element.  \n4. Petitioner makes a last-ditch effort to root her \nclaim in 2003 when she was a \u201cqualified individual\u201d by \narguing this Court may \u201cconceive of this claim as \nencompassing two moments of time that complete the \nwhole: when the facially discriminatory policy was \nadopted in 2003, and when Lt. Stanley became \ndisabled.\u201d Pet. Br. 26. However, this Court has \nrecognized that Title VII claims can encompass \ndifferent events at different points in time only in two \nnarrow circumstances: hostile work environment \nclaims and constructive discharge claims. Green v. \nBrennan, 578 U.S. 547, 556-57 (2016). Moreover, \nPetitioner has expressly waived any argument of \ndiscrimination at any time during her employment. \nPet. C.A. Br. 22.  \nB. Petitioner disclaimed and her complaint \nfailed to demonstrate a claim accrued at \nany time between her diagnosis and \nretirement.  \n1. The Eleventh Circuit expressly declined to pass \nupon Petitioner\u2019s untimely argument raised in her \nreply brief that a claim accrued \u201cat some unknown \npoint before she retired but after she was diagnosed \nwith Parkinson\u2019s.\u201d Pet. App. 17a. This Court should \ndecline to \u201cdecide in the first instance issues not \ndecided below.\u201d Reagan Nat'l Advert. of Austin, LLC, \n596 U.S. at 76.  \n\n22 \n\u0003\n\u0003\n2. But if this Court proceeds, it must determine \nwhether the complaint alleged that Petitioner was a \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d with a disability during her \nemployment. She must allege that she became \ndisabled \u201cduring the course of [her] employment but \nnevertheless continued to perform the essential \nrequirements of [her] job with or without a reasonable \naccommodation, until [she] became completely and \ntotally disabled.\u201d Bass v. City of Orlando, 57 F. Supp. \n2d 1318, 1323 (M.D. Fla. 1999), aff'd, 203 F.3d 841 \n(11th Cir. 1999). Contrary to the United States\u2019 \nclaims, Petitioner\u2019s complaint does not allege when or \nhow she became disabled, let alone that she continued \nto work thereafter. U.S. Amicus Br. 26. Petitioner only \nalleged that because of a \u201cphysical disability\u201d she took \na disability retirement in 2018 and as a result would \nlose the subsidy in 2020. Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 16, 26.  \nAlthough we now have the benefit of the summary \njudgment record on her Equal Protection claim, in \ntesting the sufficiency of a complaint, a district court \ndoes not \u201cassume that the [plaintiff] can prove facts \nthat it has not alleged or that the defendants have \nviolated...laws in ways that have not been alleged.\u201d \nAssociated Gen. Contractors of California, Inc. v. \nCalifornia State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, \n526 (1983); see also Aldana v. Del Monte Fresh \nProduce, N.A., Inc., 416 F.3d 1242, 1248 (11th Cir. \n2005) (a plaintiff must \u201callege sufficient facts to \nwarrant [a particular] inference\u201d). \nPetitioner led the district court to its conclusion \nwhen she failed to dispute the City\u2019s argument for \ndismissal that she only alleged post-employment \ndiscrimination when she was no longer a \u201cqualified \n\n23 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nindividual.\u201d Doc. 14 at 4-5; Doc. 17. Instead, she \nmerely argued that the district court should refuse to \nfollow Eleventh Circuit precedent in Gonzales (a case \ninvolving only post-employment discrimination). Doc. \n17 at 5-6. As the Eleventh Circuit noted, she did not \nattempt to distinguish the facts of Gonzales from her \ncase by arguing that she alleged discrimination during \nemployment. Pet. App. 18a. The district court, thus, \nproperly dismissed her ADA claim because her \ncomplaint \u201calleged [the] discrimination did not occur \nuntil Plaintiff was no longer able to perform the \nessential functions of her job.\u201d Doc. 27 at 7. \nFurther, the district court was \u201cnot required to \ngrant\u2026plaintiff leave to amend [her] complaint sua \nsponte when the plaintiff, who is represented by \ncounsel, never filed a motion to amend nor requested \nleave to amend before the district court.\u201d Wagner v. \nDaewoo Heavy Indus. Am. Corp., 314 F.3d 541, 542 \n(11th Cir. 2002). After dismissal, Petitioner did not \nmove \nfor \nreconsideration \narguing \nthe \ncourt \nmisapprehended her complaint allegedly pleading \ndiscrimination during employment. Perhaps fearing \nher claims would be time-barred, she never argued \nthey arose during her employment, years before she \nfiled her 2019 EEOC charge. Indeed, she never \nmentioned the generous accrual provisions of the \nLedbetter Act in the district court. Doc. 1, \u00b6 6.  \nPetitioner\u2019s initial brief in the Eleventh Circuit \nconfirmed that her complaint only alleged post-\nemployment discrimination because she argued she \n\u201ccould not have brought these claims while she was \nstill employed\u201d because \u201cshe would have lacked \nstanding.\u201d Pet. C.A. Br. 22. The Eleventh Circuit \n\n24 \n\u0003\n\u0003\ntherefore properly refused to pass upon this issue \nexpressly disclaimed in her initial brief and untimely \ncontradicted in her reply brief. Pet. App. 17a. This \nCourt should decline to decide this unpreserved issue \nin the first instance, and as demonstrated above, it is \nunsupported by her allegations.  \nC. The Ledbetter Act\u2019s generous accrual \nprovisions do not create a claim where \nnone exists. \nIt is clear that if a claim accrued in 2003, it \nexpired long before Petitioner filed her EEOC charge \nin 2019. Doc. 1, \u00b6 6. Petitioner argues that under the \nLedbetter Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e5(e)(3)(A), her 2003 \nclaim \u201cre-accrued in 2020\u201d when she \u201cwas \u2018affected\u2019 \nwhen her subsidy ended.\u201d Pet. Br. 24, 26 n. 1. The \nLedbetter Act has no place here.  \n\u201cOrdinarily, a limitations period commences \nwhen the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of \naction.\u201d Green v. Brennan, 578 U.S. 547, 554 (2016) \n(cleaned up). \u201c[A] cause of action does not become \n\u2018complete and present\u2019 for limitations purposes until \nthe plaintiff can file suit and obtain relief.\u201d Id. (cleaned \nup). Petitioner failed to demonstrate she had a \n\u201ccomplete and present\u201d claim during her employment.  \nIndeed, \nany \nclaim \nof \ndisability-based \ndiscrimination in 2003 when she was not disabled \nwould have been dismissed for lack of standing, as she \nconceded below but refuses to admit now. Pet. Br. C.A. \n22. If no claim accrued in 2003, it could not \u201cre-accrue\u201d \npost-employment. \u201cA plaintiff must plead and prove \nthe elements of a pay-discrimination claim to benefit \nfrom the Ledbetter Act's accrual provisions.\u201d Davis v. \n\n25 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nBombardier Transp. Holdings (USA) Inc., 794 F.3d \n266, 269 (2d Cir. 2015); see also AT & T Corp. v. \nHulteen, 556 U.S. 701, 716 (2009) (Ledbetter Act did \nnot save the plaintiff\u2019s untimely claim because the \noriginal \nemployment \npractice \n\u201cwas \nnot \ndiscriminatory\u201d). The Ledbetter Act \u201cis an accrual \nrule; it does not affect the substance of the claim.\u201d \nMcReynolds v. Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc., 694 F.3d 873, \n888 (7th Cir. 2012). Therefore, the Eleventh Circuit \ncorrectly held the Ledbetter Act\u2019s \u201crelaxed statute of \nlimitations helps a plaintiff only if that plaintiff \notherwise has a claim for discrimination.\u201d Pet. App. \n15a. \nThe Eleventh Circuit did not pass upon whether \nthe Ledbetter Act should apply to allow a Title I claim \nto \u201cre-accrue\u201d when an individual is \u201caffected\u201d post-\nemployment when she is no longer qualified. This \nCourt should decline to decide this issue in the first \ninstance. This is especially so where Petitioner has not \nshown that the facts of Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & \nRubber Co., 550 U.S. 618 (2007), which prompted the \nLedbetter Act, are sufficiently similar to the subject \nfacts to warrant extension of the Act here. Unlike the \nsecret decisions creating an unknown pay disparity for \nMs. Ledbetter, the City\u2019s subsidy policy was a publicly \nannounced act codified in its ordinances and \u201cofficial \npersonnel policies.\u201d Doc. 1, \u00b6 24; see also Doc. 38-10 at \n2-5; Doc. 38-11 at 4. Such fully communicated acts can \nbe vindicated \u201cwithout the need for the Ledbetter Act's \ngenerous accrual provisions because the employee had \nnotice of the pay reduction.\u201d Davis, 794 F.3d at 271.  \nPetitioner\u2019s later testimony claiming ignorance of \nthe ordinance is irrelevant. See Taylor v. Michael, 724 \n\n26 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nF.3d 806, 811 (7th Cir.2013) (\u201cLack of familiarity with \nthe law...is not a circumstance that justifies equitable \ntolling.\u201d). Therefore, the City\u2019s policy is akin to the \nemployment practice at issue in Ricks, not Ledbetter. \nIn Ricks, \u201cthe only alleged discrimination occurred\u2013\nand \nthe \nfiling \nlimitations \nperiods \ntherefore \ncommenced\u2013at the time the tenure decision was made \nand communicated to Ricks.\u201d 449 U.S. at 258. \u201cThat is \nso even though one of the effects of the denial of \ntenure\u2013the eventual loss of a teaching position\u2013did \nnot occur until later.\u201d Id. For such acts, \u201cthe clock \nstarts running when the plaintiff first knew or should \nhave known of his injury, whether or not he realized \nthe cause of his injury was unlawful.\u201d Almond, 665 \nF.3d at 1176.  \nTo extend the Ledbetter Act under the facts of this \ncase would open the floodgates to stale claims over \nknown, written personnel policies and publicly \nannounced ordinances. And it would allow plaintiffs to \ndelay suit indefinitely, despite knowing exactly when \na benefit will end, by arguing that the claim \u201cre-\naccrues\u201d every month that the plaintiff does not \nreceive the benefit. See, e.g., Lohrasbi v. Bd. of \nTrustees of the Univ. of Illinois, 147 F. Supp. 3d 746, \n755 (C.D. Ill. 2015) (\u201c[T]he 300-day time-limit does not \nrestart each day that Plaintiff is deprived of Professor \nEmiritus status.\u201d). The Ledbetter Act has no place \nhere and any claims that allegedly accrued during \nPetitioner\u2019s employment have long-since expired and \nbeen waived.    \n\n27 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nII. The \nCircuit \nSplit \nQuestion \nRegarding \nDiscrimination Post-Employment \nThis Court should only resolve the question \nsplitting the circuit courts: whether totally disabled \nretirees are \u201cqualified individuals\u201d entitled to seek \nrelief under Title I for discrimination occurring \nentirely post-employment. The Eleventh Circuit below \n(at Pet. App. 11a-12a) and \u201cthe majority of courts have \nheld, Title I is unambiguous; by its plain language, it \ndoes not\u201d prohibit discrimination against \u201cformer \nemployees who are unable to perform the essential \nfunctions of their jobs.\u201d McKnight v. Gen. Motors \nCorp., 550 F.3d 519, 528 (6th Cir. 2008); Morgan v. \nJoint Admin. Bd., 268 F.3d 456, 458\u201359 (7th Cir. \n2001); Weyer v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp., 198 \nF.3d 1104, 1112 (9th Cir. 2000).   \nOnly two circuits have disagreed and held that \nTitle I is ambiguous because it allegedly fails to \n\u201cspecify when a potential plaintiff must have been a \n\u2018qualified individual\u2019...\u201d Castellano v. City of New York, \n142 F.3d 58, 67 (2d Cir. 1998) (emphasis in original); \nFord v. Schering-Plough Corp., 145 F.3d 601, 606 (3d \nCir. 1998). The Third Circuit also found an ambiguity, \nnot in the text, but in the \u201cdisjunction between the \nADA\u2019s definition of \u2018qualified individual with a \ndisability\u2019 and the rights that the ADA confers.\u201d Ford, \n145 F.3d at 605. \nAs \nthe \nEleventh \nCircuit \nexplained \nbelow \n\u201c[n]either court established that the text of Title I\u2019s \nanti-discrimination provision is ambiguous.\u201d Pet. App. \n12a. \u201cInstead, the Second and the Third Circuit \nexpressed \nsomething \nbetween \ndiscomfort \nand \ndisagreement with the policy choice underlying the \n\n28 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nline, drawn by the text of the ADA, between disabled \nindividuals who hold or desire to hold a job and those \nwho do not.\u201d Pet. App. 12a. \u201cBut not \u2018even the most \nformidable policy arguments\u2019 empower a court to \nignore unambiguous text.\u201d Id. (citation omitted). And \nthat text plainly prohibits discrimination solely \nagainst individuals who \u201ccan perform the essential \nfunctions\u201d of the job \u201cthat such individual holds or \ndesires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12111(8), 12112(a). \nA. Title I requires an individual to hold or \ndesire \na \njob \nat \nthe \ntime \nof \nthe \ndiscriminatory act to be a \u201cqualified \nindividual.\u201d \nThe first step \u201cin interpreting a statute is to \ndetermine whether the language at issue has a plain \nand unambiguous meaning with regard to the \nparticular dispute in the case.\u201d Robinson v. Shell Oil \nCo., 519 U.S. 337, 340 (1997). \u201cThe plainness or \nambiguity of statutory language is determined by \nreference to the language itself, the specific context in \nwhich that language is used, and the broader context \nof the statute as a whole.\u201d Id. at 341. \n1. \nThe text uses the present tense as a \ntemporal \nqualifier \nto \nprohibit \ndiscrimination solely against an \nindividual who \u201ccan perform\u201d the \njob she presently \u201cholds or desires.\u201d      \na. Title I\u2019s anti-discrimination provision (the \n\u201cgeneral rule\u201d) and its incorporated definition of a \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d are unambiguous. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 \n12112(a), 12111(8). The \u201cgeneral rule\u201d makes it \nunlawful for an employer to \u201cdiscriminate against a \n\n29 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nqualified individual on the basis of disability in regard \nto \njob \napplication \nprocedures, \nthe \nhiring, \nadvancement, or discharge of employees, employee \ncompensation, \njob \ntraining, \nand \nother \nterms, \nconditions, and privileges of employment.\u201d Id. \u00a7 \n12112(a).  \nSection 12111(8) defines a \u201cqualified individual\u201d \nas \u201can individual who, with or without reasonable \naccommodation, can perform the essential functions of \nthe employment position that such individual holds or \ndesires.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12111(8). Because the general rule \nexpressly incorporates the definition of a \u201cqualified \nindividual,\u201d an \u201cADA plaintiff bears the burden of \nproving that she is...a person \u2018who, with or without \nreasonable accommodation, can perform the essential \nfunctions\u2019 of her job,\u201d Cleveland v. Policy Mgmt. Sys. \nCorp., 526 U.S. 795, 806 (1999), at the time of the \nprohibited discrimination. (emphasis added).  \n\u201cCongress\u2019 use of a verb tense is significant in \nconstruing statutes.\u201d United States v. Wilson, 503 U.S. \n329, 333 (1992). For example, the ADA\u2019s use of \u201cthe \npresent indicative verb form\u201d requires \u201cthat a person \nbe presently\u2026substantially limited in order to \ndemonstrate a disability.\u201d Sutton v. United Air Lines, \nInc., 527 U.S. 471, 482 (1999), superseded, in part, on \nother grounds, ADAAA of 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-325, \u00a7 \n2(b)(3) (emphasis added); Dictionary Act, 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 \n(\u201cIn determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, \nunless the context indicates otherwise...words used in \nthe present tense include the future as well as the \npresent\u201d\u2014not the past). \nSection 12112(a) does not prohibit discrimination \nagainst an individual who performed the job that such \n\n30 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nindividual held or desired. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12112(a), \n12111(8). The present tense is used to require that an \nindividual be able to perform her job at the time of the \ndiscrimination.  \nThis is not to say that a former employee can \nnever sue under Title I. The Eleventh Circuit held she \nmay sue if her claim is based \u201con an act committed by \nthe defendant while the plaintiff was either working \nfor the defendant or seeking to work for the \ndefendant.\u201d Pet. App. 8a-9a. This is because the \ngeneral rule does not require a former employee to be \na \u201cqualified individual\u201d at the time of the lawsuit. See \nid. \u00a7 12112(a). Its focus is on the individual\u2019s \nqualifications at the time of the discriminatory act \nbecause it speaks only in terms of the prohibited \ndiscrimination\u2014not when suit is filed. Id. Any \nmischaracterization of the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s holding \nto categorically exclude retirees from suing under \nTitle I, must be rejected. It correctly held that \n\u201c[b]ecause Stanley cannot establish that the City \ncommitted any discriminatory acts against her while \nshe could perform the essential functions of a job that \nshe held or desired to hold, her Title I claim fails.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 18a.  \nb. This Court\u2019s decision in Robinson reinforces the \nsignificance of present tense verbs as \u201ctemporal \nqualifiers\u201d to limit the scope of a statute\u2019s protection \nto current employees. 519 U.S. at 341-42 & n. 2. The \nquestion in Robinson was whether the word \n\u201cemployees\u201d in Title VII\u2019s anti-retaliation provision, \u00a7 \n704(a), includes former employees. Id. at 339. Section \n704(a) makes it unlawful \u201cfor an employer to \ndiscriminate against any of his employees or \n\n31 \n\u0003\n\u0003\napplicants for employment\u201d who have availed \nthemselves of Title VII\u2019s protections or assisted others \nin so doing. Id. Section 701(f) defines \u201cemployee\u201d as \n\u201can individual employed by an employer.\u201d Id. at 342 \n(emphasis added).  \nThis Court explained that certain features of \u00a7 \n704(a) made it ambiguous and militated in favor of \nreading it to include former employees. Id. at 341. \nFirst, this Court emphasized that \u201cthere is no \ntemporal qualifier\u201d in \u00a7 704(a). Id. Second, the \ndefinition of \u201cemployees\u201d in \u00a7 701(f) was consistent \nwith either current or past employment because the \nword \u201cemployed\u201d used therein could mean \u201cis \nemployed\u201d or \u201cwas employed.\u201d Id. at 342 (emphasis in \noriginal). Thus, this Court concluded that like \u00a7 \n704(a), the definition of \u201cemployees\u201d in \u00a7 701(f) \u201clacks \nany temporal qualifier.\u201d Id.  \nOn this critical \u201ctemporal qualifier\u201d point, this \nCourt distinguished its decision just one month earlier \nin Walters v. Metro. Educational Enters., 519 U.S. 202 \n(1997). Id. at 341 n. 2. In Walters, this Court \nunanimously held that \u201cemployees\u201d as used in \u00a7 701(b) \nrelating to the 15-employee threshold for coverage by \nTitle \nVII, \nunambiguously \nreferred \nto \ncurrent \nemployees only. 519 U.S. at 341, n.2. This was because \n\u00a7 701(b) clearly included \u201ctwo significant temporal \nqualifiers.\u201d Id. This Court noted \u00a7 701(b)\u2019s language \nstating that Title VII \u201capplies to any employer \u2018who \nhas fifteen or more employees for each working day\u2026\u2019\u201d \nId. (emphasis in original). \u201cThe emphasized words \nspecify the time frame in which the employment \nrelationship must exist, and thus the specific context \nof that section did not present the particular \n\n32 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nambiguity at issue in the present case.\u201d Id. Indeed, \u00a7 \n701(b)\u2019s use of the present-tense as a temporal \nqualifier was critical in distinguishing the facts of \nRobinson. \nThe majority of courts have thus correctly \nconcluded that \u201cTitle I, unlike the section of Title VII \nat issue in Robinson, has a \u2018temporal qualifier.\u2019\u201d \nWeyer, 198 F.3d at 1112. Because \u00a7 12111(8) \u201cuses the \npresent tense...one must be able to perform the \nessential functions of employment at the time that one \nis discriminated against.\u201d Id. Section 12111(8)\u2019s other \ntemporal qualifiers reinforce this conclusion. It also \nrefers in the present tense to \u201cthe employment \nposition that such individual holds or desires.\u201d 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8) (emphasis added). The ADA, \ntherefore, has more in common with the provision that \nthis Court limited to current employees in Walters \nthan to the anti-retaliation provision distinguished in \nRobinson.  \n2. \nThe \nspecific \ncontext \nin \nwhich \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d is used within \nthe anti-discrimination provision \nshows \nthat \nit \nprohibits \ndiscrimination solely against those \nwho presently hold or desire jobs.    \nAfter examining the language itself, we next look \nto the \u201cspecific context in which that language is used\u201d \nto discern its meaning. Robinson, 519 U.S. at 341. The \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition is used within the \nanti-discrimination provision. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12112(a), \n12111(8). Petitioner\u2019s incorrect interpretation of Title \nI derives from her narrow focus on the \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d definition completely out of context from \n\n33 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nthe general rule where the definition appears. A \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d means an individual who \u201ccan \nperform the essential functions\u201d of the job she \u201cholds \nor desires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8). Petitioner argues \nthat the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of the \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d definition is to protect employers from \nbeing compelled to hire or retain unqualified \nindividuals by \u201ctesting\u201d an employee's capabilities. \nPet. Br. 34. And so, she argues if an individual has no \njob, an employer has no interest in the individual\u2019s \nability to perform and thus the \u201ccan perform\u201d clause \ncan be ignored. Id. 24, 34-35.  \nThis argument barely holds water when the \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition is read in a vacuum. \nIt completely fails when the definition is read within \nthe general rule where it appears. Indeed, \u201c[t]he \nquestion isn\u2019t just what [qualified individual] mean[s], \nbut what [Title I] says about it.\u201d Bostock, 590 U.S. at \n656. Read in context, the general rule prohibits \ndiscrimination solely against an individual who can \nperform the job she holds or desires. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n12111(8), 12112(a).  \nAnd so, the primary purpose of this anti-\ndiscrimination rule is not to protect the hiring \nprerogatives of employers, but to protect certain \ndisabled individuals from discrimination: those who \npresently work, want to work and can work despite \ntheir disabilities. See Tyndall v. Nat'l Educ. Centers, \nInc. of California, 31 F.3d 209, 215 (4th Cir. 1994) \n(\u201c[T]he primary purpose of the ADA...[is] to encourage \nemployers to take on qualified individuals, regardless \nof their disability.\u201d). Title I was intended to \u201cdraw \nworkers with a disability into the workforce.\u201d Morgan, \n\n34 \n\u0003\n\u0003\n268 F.3d at 458 (emphasis added). Its \u201clanguage [is] \nwell designed to help people get and keep jobs, not to \nhelp those no longer able to work get disability pay.\u201d \nWeyer, 198 F.3d at 1112; see also Pet. App. 8a (the \nADA\u2019s \u201ccentral purpose\u201d is \u201cprotecting disabled people \nwho can nevertheless perform the essential functions \nof a job\u201d). Indeed, drawing the disabled into the \nworkforce would save \u201cthe United States billions of \ndollars in unnecessary expenses resulting from \ndependency and nonproductivity.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n12101(8) (emphasis added).  \nThus, \nthe \nprimary \npurpose \nof \nthe \nanti-\ndiscrimination rule is to prohibit employers from \ndiscriminating \nagainst \ncurrent \nemployees \nand \napplicants who can work despite their disabilities\u2014\nnot to impose a \u201ctest\u201d on employees that they either \n\u201cpass,\u201d \u201cfail,\u201d or in the case of retirees, are allegedly \nexempt from taking. See Pet. Br. 34. By interpreting \nthe definition of a \u201cqualified individual\u201d in a vacuum, \nPetitioner commits the same error as the Second \nCircuit \ndid \nin \nCastellano. \nThere, \ndespite \nacknowledging that it must consider \u201cthe specific \ncontext in which that language is used,\u201d the court \nskipped that step, isolated the definition, and \nconcluded that it failed \u201cto specify when a potential \nplaintiff must have been a \u2018qualified individual with a \ndisability\u2019...\u201d 142 F.3d at 67 (emphasis in original). It \nthen \u201cmanufactured ambiguity where none existed.\u201d \nMcKnight, 550 F.3d at 527.  \nHad the Castellano court read the definition in \ncontext as used in the general rule, it would have \nrealized that the statute says exactly when an \nindividual must be qualified. A violation only arises if \n\n35 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nan employer discriminates against a \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d and thus if one is not qualified at the time \nof the discrimination there is no violation and no \nclaim. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a). By focusing on those who \n\u201ccan perform\u201d jobs they \u201chold or desire\u201d Congress \nlimited the statute\u2019s protections to current employees \nand applicants.  \nEven considering the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of the \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition as narrowly defined \nby Petitioner to protect employers from being forced to \nhire or retain unqualified individuals, Petitioner\u2019s \nargument fails. \u201c[E]xcept in the rare case of an obvious \nscrivener\u2019s error, purpose\u2014even purpose as most \nnarrowly defined\u2014cannot be used to contradict text or \nto supplement it.\u201d A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading \nLaw: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 57 (2012) \n(\u201cScalia & Garner\u201d). Petitioner\u2019s argument that the \npurpose of the \u201ccan perform\u201d clause should be deemed \n\u201csatisfied\u201d in the case of retirees is nothing more than \na request for this Court to rewrite the text to include \nan exception to the \u201ccan perform\u201d clause for retirees.  \nAnd regardless of whether an employer is \nconcerned with a retiree\u2019s ability to perform, Congress \nwas concerned solely with protecting those who \u201ccan \nperform.\u201d If an individual is totally disabled or no \nlonger holds or desires their position, the statute is \nsilent as to discrimination against that individual. \nPetitioner presumes, based on nothing, that the \nstatute must say something about retirees who do not \nhold or desire their jobs. But a \u201cjudge should not \npresume that every statute answers every question, \nthe answers to be discovered through interpretation.\u201d \nScalia & Garner, 93.  \n\n36 \n\u0003\n\u0003\n\u201c[T]he limitations of a text\u2014what a text chooses \nnot to do\u2014are as much a part of its \u2018purposes\u2019 as its \naffirmative dispositions.\u201d Id. at 57 (emphasis in \noriginal). These \u201climitations must be respected, and \nthe only way to accord them their due is to reject the \nreplacement or supplementation of text with purpose.\u201d \nId. at 57-58. Title I expressly limits its protections to \nthose who can perform the jobs they hold or desire. \nThere are no exceptions, and this Court should not \nalter the plain language to make any to appease \nPetitioner\u2019s policy preferences.  \n3. \nTitle \nI\u2019s \ndistinction \nbetween \n\u201cqualified \nindividuals\u201d \nand \n\u201cindividuals\u201d \nis \nconsistent \nthroughout the statutory scheme.   \nThe ADA\u2019s \u201cstatutory scheme is coherent and \nconsistent.\u201d Robinson, 519 U.S. at 340. The ADA\u2019s use \nof \u201cqualified individual\u201d does not vary in different \nprovisions. In Robinson, on the other hand, this Court \nfound that the word \u201cemployee\u201d included former \nemployees in at least some provisions of Title VII. Id. \nat 342-43. Having found \u00a7 704(a) ambiguous, this \nCourt considered what interpretation would be most \nconsistent with that section's purpose. In doing so, this \nCourt emphasized that \u00a7 704(a) was an anti-\nretaliation provision that by its nature would be \n\u201ceffectively vitiate[d]\u201d if it were confined to current \nemployees. Id. at 345. However, the ambiguities and \npolicy concerns that drove this Court\u2019s analysis of Title \nVII\u2019s anti-retaliation provision do not exist under Title \nI of the ADA.  \nTitle I does not protect against retaliation. The \nADA prohibits retaliation under Title V. See 42 U.S.C. \n\n37 \n\u0003\n\u0003\n\u00a7 12203(a) (it is unlawful for any employer \u201cto \ndiscriminate against any individual because such \nindividual has opposed any act or practice made \nunlawful by this chapter...\u201d) (emphasis added). Thus, \nthe concerns that impelled this Court to a broad \nconstruction of Title VII\u2019s anti-retaliation provision \nare not present here, because the ADA's anti-\nretaliation provision is expressly drawn to cover \u201cany \nindividual,\u201d not just the narrower subset of \u201cqualified \nindividuals\u201d covered by Title I. See Morgan, 268 F.3d \nat 458 (\u201cThe difference is stark.\u201d). Thus, when \nCongress wanted to prohibit discrimination against \ndisabled former employees, \u201cit did so clearly and \nexplicitly,\u201d Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U.S. 438, \n455 \n(2002), \nby \nreferring \nto \n\u201cindividuals\u201d\u2014not \n\u201cqualified individuals.\u201d \nB. Petitioner\u2019s contrary arguments lack \nmerit. \nAs described above, the Second and Third Circuits \nare the only circuits to side with Petitioner\u2019s \nargument. See supra Castellano and Ford. Recently, \nhowever, the Second Circuit acknowledged that \u201c[i]n \ngeneral, the determination of whether a person is \n\u2018qualified\u2019 should be made at the time of the \ndiscriminatory employment action,\u201d but in Castellano, \nthe court \u201ccreated a narrow exception to the rule for \npost-employment benefits intended to be used by \nretirees.\u201d Smith v. Town of Ramapo, 745 Fed. Appx. \n424, 426 (2d Cir. 2018) (emphasis added). Thus, even \nthe Second Circuit, albeit in an unpublished opinion, \nadmits that Castellano judicially-created a \u201cnarrow \nexception\u201d to the plain text of the rule articulated by \nCongress. Id.  \n\n38 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nPetitioner now rejects the Second and Third \nCircuit\u2019s finding of ambiguity in the \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d definition. She argues their judgments are \ndictated by the plain text of Title I, which she claims \nimposes only a \u201cconditional\u201d mandate that one be able \nto perform their job only if they hold or desire one. Pet. \nBr. 28. Despite this recasting of the argument, \nPetitioner is still guilty of the same cardinal sin of \nstatutory construction committed by the Second and \nThird Circuits. She too rewrites Title I by creating a \n\u201cnarrow exception\u201d to the \u201ccan perform\u201d clause just for \nretirees.  \n1. \nPetitioner\u2019s interpretation of the \nperformance requirement of the \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition as a \n\u201cconditional \nmandate,\u201d \nadds \nan \nunwritten \nexception \nto \nthat \nrequirement for retirees.    \na. The alleged \u201cconditional\u201d nature of the \nperformance requirement of the \u201cqualified individual\u201d \ndefinition cannot be divined from any part of the \nstatutory text. In support of this theory, Petitioner \nresorts to strained and unnatural constructions such \nas retirees are \u201cnot unable to perform the essential \nfunctions of a job that they hold or desire.\u201d Pet. Br. 34. \nShe admits \u201ctesting the job capabilities of someone \nwho is no longer working may seem logically \nawkward.\u201d Id. That is putting it mildly. But purported \nlogic aside, the text simply does not contain any \nlanguage conditioning the ability to perform on \nwhether a person holds or desires a job.  \nTitle I makes no exceptions to the \u201ccan perform\u201d \nclause. Courts should not \u201celaborate unprovided-for \n\n39 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nexceptions to a text\u2026\u2018[I]f the Congress [had] intended \nto provide...exceptions, it would have done so in clear \nlanguage.\u2019\u201d Scalia & Garner, 93. Petitioner improperly \nargues for a \u201ctacit exception,\u201d Bostock. 590 U.S. at 669, \nto Title I\u2019s \u201ccan perform\u201d clause. But \u201cwhen Congress \nchooses not to include any exceptions to a broad rule, \ncourts apply the broad rule.\u201d Id. \nThe correct reading of Title I to only prohibit \ndiscrimination against an individual who presently \nholds or desires a job that she can perform gives effect \nto all of the words in \u00a7\u00a7 12112(a) and 12111(8). \nPetitioner's interpretation, on the other hand, \nrequires the addition and subtraction of language \nfrom Title I. It does not, however, prohibit \ndiscrimination against an individual who can perform \nthe essential functions of the job only if she holds or \ndesires one. \nEven if Congress wanted to imply that the \nperformance requirement was conditioned upon an \nindividual having or wanting a job, Congress would \nnot have referred to \u201cthe employment position\u201d that \nsuch individual holds or desires. Id. \u00a7 12111(8) \n(emphasis added). By referring to \u201cthe employment \nposition\u201d the text clearly indicates that the job \ncurrently exists. Petitioner\u2019s reading replaces \u201cthe\u201d \nwith \u201can\u201d to read the definition as only requiring the \nability to perform if the individual has an employment \nposition. This addition and subtraction of text cannot \nbe countenanced by this Court.  \nPetitioner argues Congress did not include \u201can\u201d \ninstead of \u201cthe\u201d because that would have made the \nstatute too confusing. Pet. Br. 44. As already \ndiscussed, Congress knew exactly how to expand the \n\n40 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nADA\u2019s protections to other individuals besides current \nemployees and applicants. See supra 36-37. It also \nwould have been a very simple matter for Congress to \ndo what the Second and Third Circuits did to Title I by \ninserting a \u201cnarrow exception\u201d to the \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d definition for retirees. Smith, 745 Fed. \nAppx. at 426. Congress did none of these things and \nPetitioner\u2019s arguments fail.  \nb. \nPetitioner\u2019s \n\u201cconditional \nmandate\u201d \ninterpretation opens the door to a host of new \n\u201cqualified individuals\u201d none of whom Congress \nintended to protect. It will create bizarre incentives for \nemployees to simply deny desiring a job or promotion \nto circumvent the requirement that they be able to \nperform it. An employee totally incapable of \nperforming a certain position could sue if she is not \ngiven the position because of her disability. So long as \nshe doesn\u2019t apply for the promotion or otherwise \nindicate that she \u201cdesires\u201d it, she can sue if a non-\ndisabled employee is given the position over her \ndespite her inability to perform the position because of \nher disability. Petitioner\u2019s \u201cconditional mandate\u201d test \nis unworkable and should be rejected.  \nc. While Petitioner argues that retirees are \n\u201cqualified individuals\u201d who need not satisfy the \u201ccan \nperform\u201d clause, the United States takes a different \napproach that also fails. U.S. Amicus Br. 30. It argues \npost-employment discrimination against a retiree \n\u201cretroactively\u201d changes the terms of employment and \nso \u201cit is naturally described as discrimination against \na qualified individual...even if the plaintiff is no longer \nemployed.\u201d Id. What the United States characterizes \nas a \u201cretroactive change\u201d to the terms of employment \n\n41 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nis actually just a breach of contract. No court would \never describe such a breach as a \u201cretroactive change\u201d \nto a contract. If it did, then all a breaching party would \nhave to do to \u201cretroactively change\u201d the terms of a \ncontract would be to breach it. This, of course, is \nabsurd.  \nAnd whether the changed term of employment is \na contractual term or just a privilege, is irrelevant. \nThere is no time machine that an employer travels in \nto alter the terms or privileges that existed during \nemployment. Those terms and privileges remain the \nsame regardless of any later refusal to honor them. \nTherefore, it is legally unsound to say that a present \nbreach is a past harm to a plaintiff when she was a \n\u201cqualified individual.\u201d A post-employment change only \naffects someone who is unqualified. Moreover, the \nchange happened during Petitioner\u2019s employment in \n2003, but she waived any such claim. So the United \nStates\u2019 argument is purely hypothetical.  \nThe United States primarily argues for reversal \non the grounds Petitioner disclaimed. Its arguments \nfail for all the same reasons described above in Part I. \nIts focus on the alleged discrimination occurring \nduring employment confirms Title I\u2019s purpose to \nprohibit such acts during, not after, employment.  \n \n\n42 \n\u0003\n\u0003\n2. \nPetitioner\u2019s interpretation of the \n\u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d \ndefinition \nsolely \nas \na \nscreen \nto \nprotect \nemployers renders \u00a7\u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A), \n(b)(6), (b)(7), and (d)(2) superfluous. \nPetitioner argues that \u00a7\u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A), (b)(6), \n(b)(7), and (d)(2) allegedly all do the same work as the \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition by allowing employers \nto take actions against disabled employees that \u201care \njustified in relation to the operation of their business.\u201d \nPet. Br. 31. But if these subsections of \u00a7 12112 perform \nthis function, then the same function allegedly \nperformed by \u00a7 12111(8) is rendered superfluous. \nInstead, \u00a7 12111(8) as used in the general rule, tells \nemployers who they may not discriminate against\u2014\nthose who hold or want jobs they can perform\u2014but \nthen \u00a7\u00a7 12112(b) and (d)(2) provide exceptions to that \ngeneral prohibition for the protection of the business.  \nAccordingly, \nPetitioner\u2019s \nreliance \non \nthese \nsubsections undermines her argument and proves the \nCity\u2019s point that the general rule sets forth its limited \nprotection of current employees and applicants who \ncan perform despite their disabilities, but then \u00a7\u00a7 \n12112(b) and (d) include exceptions to that general \nprohibition to allow an employer to discriminate \nagainst these \u201cqualified individuals\u201d where it is \nnecessary to protect the business. \n \n\n43 \n\u0003\n\u0003\n3. \nThe \nEleventh \nCircuit\u2019s \ninterpretation does not render \u00a7 \n12112(b)(5)(A) superfluous.  \nPetitioner argues that if the \u201cqualified individual\u201d \ndefinition excludes those who do not hold or desire a \njob, then \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A)\u2019s reference to an \u201cotherwise \nqualified individual with a disability who is an \napplicant or employee\u201d is surplusage. Pet. Br. 32-33. \nShe is incorrect. \nSection 12112(b) is the \u201cconstruction\u201d provision \nexplaining that the term \u201cdiscriminate against a \nqualified individual on the basis of disability,\u201d \nincludes several forms of discrimination. Section \n12112(b) is replete with references to \u201ca job applicant \nor employee,\u201d sometimes repeating that phrase \nmultiple times within one subsection. See, e.g., \u00a7 \n12112(b)(1). Section 12112(b)(2) also repeats the \nreference to a \u201cqualified applicant or employee\u201d even \nthough it is defining what is included in the term \n\u201cdiscriminate against a qualified individual.\u201d Id. \u00a7 \n12112(b)(2). Likewise, \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(B) refers to a \u201cjob \napplicant or employee who is an otherwise qualified \nindividual with a disability.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(B).  \nThe repetition of these phrases serves only to \nemphasize how important it was to Congress that a \nplaintiff have an actual, present relationship with an \nemployer, as an employee or job applicant, to sue. \nWhile a \u201cqualified individual\u201d may be someone who \nmerely \u201cdesires\u201d a job under \u00a7 12111(8), \u00a7 12112(b) \nclarifies that the individual must actually apply for a \njob to establish a sufficient relationship to the \nemployer to justify imposing obligations on the \nemployer under the ADA. There is no surplusage \n\n44 \n\u0003\n\u0003\ncaused by the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s correct reading of \nTitle I.  \nBut even assuming that the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s \ninterpretation renders the phrase \u201capplicants and \nemployees\u201d in \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A) somehow superfluous, \nthat should not alter the conclusion. \u201cThe canon \nagainst surplusage is not an absolute rule.\u201d Marx v. \nGeneral Revenue Corp., 568 U.S. 371, 385 (2013). \n4. \nPetitioner\u2019s arguments regarding \ncommon usage, grammar and logic \nrely on false analogies.  \nBy focusing on the definition of a \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d in isolation, Petitioner concocts several \nfalse \nanalogies \nin \nsupport \nof \nher \nstrained \ninterpretation. When the definition is read out of \ncontext, it is stripped of its meaning and malleable to \nPetitioner\u2019s many unhelpful hypotheticals. She posits \na movie theater rule: \u201cYou can\u2019t watch the movie \nunless you silence your cell phone.\u201d Pet. Br. 35. She \nstates if you don\u2019t have a phone surely you don\u2019t \nviolate the rule. Id. This rule is not analogous at all to \nTitle I. \nThis rule imposes a prohibition on the patron\u2014\nnot the movie theater. And the prohibition against the \npatron is imposed by the movie theater\u2014not a \nregulator of the movie theater and so the intent behind \nthe rule is not analogous to Title I. When the theater \nis the one imposing the restriction, its intent is to \nprotect other patrons from disruption by noisy cell \nphones. But if a patron does not hold a cell phone, then \nthe theater\u2019s concern is not implicated. So, of course, \nthe theater will let you in if you don\u2019t have a cell \n\n45 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nphone. After all, its motivation is to sell as many \ntickets as possible so long as the ticket holders are not \ndisturbing others.  \nBut a proper analogy to Title I would require a \nhypothetical rule that says, \u201cno movie theater shall \nrefuse entry to an individual who can silence the cell \nphone that such individual holds.\u201d If a patron doesn\u2019t \nhold a cell phone, then under this properly analogous \nrule, the theater can grant the patron entry if it wants, \nbut nothing in the rule prohibits the movie theater \nfrom refusing that patron entry. This is because the \nonly thing that is prohibited by the regulator is refusal \nof entry to people who hold cells phones that can be \nsilenced. The focus, from the regulator\u2019s perspective, \nis clearly on protecting people with cell phones.  \nAt first blush, it may seem strange that this \nfictional regulator did not prohibit discrimination \nagainst people without cell phones, but not once we \nrealize that the regulator enacted the rule with the \nprotection of people with cell phones in mind. Perhaps \nthe regulator was concerned with making sure people \nwith cell phones can still attend movies and did not \nwant theaters to reject them solely because their cell \nphones could disturb others. So long as the cell phone \ncan be silenced, the regulator prohibits movie theaters \nfrom refusing entry to people with cell phones.  \nSimilarly, under Title I, when we realize that \nCongress was concerned only with protecting those \nwho work or want to work, we can see the clear \npurpose of the \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition within \nthe anti-discrimination rule to prohibit discrimination \nsolely against those individuals as long as they can \nperform despite their disabilities. It was not concerned \n\n46 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nwith anyone else in this one statute. It doesn\u2019t mean \nthat employers have a license to discriminate against \nretirees. There are several other laws that would \nprohibit such misconduct. Disabled retirees may face \nchallenges, but Title I \u201cneed not address all aspects of \na problem in one fell swoop; policymakers may focus \non their most pressing concerns.\u201d Williams-Yulee v. \nFlorida Bar, 575 U.S. 433, 449 (2015). \nPetitioner provides other purported analogies all \nsuffering from the same flaw as her movie theater \nhypothetical. Their structure does not mimic Title I\u2019s \nstructure and are thus useless to this Court. For \nexample, her \u201ccommand\u201d analogy fails because \nCongress did not make a command to an employee. \nPet. Br. 39. She argues \u201cWhen a command is \nconditional, its condition may be either overt or \nexplicit.\u201d Id. The command, \u201cDrive carefully!\u201d is \nconditioned on the subject of that command to be in \nthe act of driving. But Congress did not command an \nemployee to \u201cPerform your job!\u201d If it did, then perhaps \nwe could say that an employee must perform only if \nshe has a job. The \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition, \nhowever, does not appear within a command directed \nat an employee. It appears within the anti-\ndiscrimination provision commanding employers not \nto discriminate against individuals who can perform \ntheir jobs.  \nNo matter how many expedient hypotheticals \nPetitioner poses, there is only one way this Court can \nreach her desired outcome\u2014by creating an exception, \njust for retirees, to the plain language prohibiting \ndiscrimination solely against those who can perform \ntheir jobs. \n\n47 \n\u0003\n\u0003\n \n5. \nPetitioner\u2019s \nargument \nthat \nher \ninterpretation is consistent with \nTitle VII and avoids surplusage and \nabsurd consequences, fails. \na. The Eleventh Circuit\u2019s interpretation \ndoes not render the \u201ccompensation\u201d clause of \u00a7 \n12112(a) superfluous. Simply because Title I \nprotects \n\u201ccompensation,\u201d \nincluding \nretirement \nbenefits, does not mean that Title I was designed to \n\u201cprotect \nretirees\u201d \nfrom \npost-employment \ndiscrimination. Pet. Br. 46. The purpose of the \n\u201ccompensation\u201d clause cannot be pursued at the \nexpense of negating Title I\u2019s plain text, especially \nwhen there are numerous circumstances where the \nreference to \u201ccompensation\u201d can be given effect \nwithout \nnullifying \nthe \n\u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d \nlimitations.  \nBecause litigants can sue employers who adopt \ndiscriminatory fringe benefits policies during their \nemployment when they are \u201cqualified individuals,\u201d \neffect can be given to the \u201ccompensation\u201d clause \nwithout \nnegating \nthe \n\u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d \nrequirements. \u201cCompensation\u201d and \u201cfringe benefits\u201d \ncan include a variety of benefits received during \nemployment such as health insurance, vacation pay, \novertime pay, and sick leave. While retirement \nbenefits might be among the items that make up the \nuniverse of compensation or benefits, they are not the \nexclusive or the most important benefit. Because \nemployees who satisfy the plain language of the \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition receive multiple types \nof \u201ccompensation\u201d and \u201cbenefits,\u201d the inclusion of \n\n48 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nthose terms in Title I can be given effect without \nrewriting \u00a7 12111(8). \nThe fact that retirees cannot sue regarding \ndiscriminatory benefits and compensation in every \nscenario does not render Title I\u2019s references to \n\u201ccompensation\u201d superfluous. \u201cNo text pursues its \npurposes at all costs.\u201d Scalia & Garner, 57; Clifford F. \nMacEvoy Co. v. U.S. for Use & Benefit of Calvin \nTomkins Co., 322 U.S. 102, 107 (1944) (even a \u201chighly \nremedial\u201d \nstatute \n\u201centitled \nto \na \nliberal \nconstruction\u2026does not justify ignoring plain words of \nlimitation.\u201d). This \u201cCourt cannot construe a statute in \na way that negates its plain text, and here, Congress \nexpressly limited,\u201d Honeycutt v. United States, 581 \nU.S. 443, 454 n. 2 (2017), Title I\u2019s protections to those \nwho can perform the jobs they hold or desire.  \nb. In the context of a \u201cqualified individual,\u201d \nTitle I and Title VII are not analogous. Petitioner \nargues that her interpretation of Title I would \nmaintain \u201ccongruity between the ADA and Title VII, \nthe statute on which much of title I was \u2018modeled.\u2019\u201d \nPet. Br. 46. While Title I \u201cborrows much of its \nprocedural \nframework \nfrom \n[T]itle \nVII...by \nincorporating title VII's enforcement provisions,\u201d Title \nI \u201cborrows much of its substantive framework from \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.\u201d \nH.R.Rep. No. 101\u2013485(III), at 31 (1990) (emphasis \nadded). The \u201cconcept\u201d of a \u201cqualified individual\u201d who \nmust be able to perform the \u201cessential functions\u201d of her \njob comes from \u201cthe regulations implementing...the \nRehabilitation Act\u201d\u2014not Title VII. Id. at 33. \nThere is no counterpart to the \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d definition in Title VII, so loose references \n\n49 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nto Title VII and the ADA as \u201csibling statutes,\u201d Ford, \n145 F.3d at 606, obscure these important differences \nin the text. Although Title VII and the ADA may be \nclosely related in other respects, on the issue here \u201cthe \nstatutes are not analogous.\u201d Weyer, 198 F.3d at 1111. \nc. Petitioner\u2019s reliance on the absurd results \ntest fails. Petitioner argues there is no plausible \nexplanation for the \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition to \nexclude retirees and she invokes the \u201cabsurd results\u201d \ntest. Pet. Br. 46-47. This \u201cCourt rarely invokes such a \ntest to override unambiguous legislation.\u201d Barnhart, \n534 U.S. at 459. This test is stringent and states \u201cthe \nabsurdity must consist of a disposition that no \nreasonable person could intend.\u201d Scalia & Garner, \n237.  \nHere, there are \u201cseveral explanations for why \nCongress would have purposefully exempted\u201d retirees \nfrom the statute\u2019s coverage. Barnhart, 534 U.S. at 459. \n\u201cCongress could reasonably decide to enable disabled \npeople who can work with reasonable accommodation \nto get and keep jobs, without also deciding to equalize \npost-employment fringe benefits for people who \ncannot work.\u201d Weyer, 198 F.3d at 1112. \u201cCongress has \nthe authority to improve the circumstances of disabled \npeople in some respects even if it does not improve \nthem in all respects.\u201d Id. \u201cLegislation often results \nfrom a delicate compromise among competing \ninterests and concerns.\u201d Id. at 1113; Barnhart, 534 \nU.S. \nat \n461 \n(any \n\u201cdissatisfaction\u201d \nwith \nthe \nconsequences of plain text is \u201coften the cost of \nlegislative compromise.\u201d). \u201cIf we were to \u2018fully \neffectuate\u2019 what we take to be the underlying policy of \nthe legislation, without careful attention to the \n\n50 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nqualifying words in the statute, then we would be \noverturning \nthe \nnuanced \ncompromise \nin \nthe \nlegislation, and substituting our own cruder, less \nresponsive mandate for the law that was actually \npassed.\u201d Weyer, 198 F.3d at 1113. \nTitle I, thus, reasonably prohibits employers from \ndiscriminating solely \u201cagainst people with disabilities \nthat do not prevent job performance, but when a \ndisability renders a person unable to perform the \nessential functions of the job, that disability renders \nhim or her unqualified.\u201d Stevens v. Rite Aid Corp., 851 \nF.3d 224, 229 (2d Cir. 2017). When the perceived gap \nin Title I for the protection of retirees is understood for \nwhat it really is\u2014important compromise that \nfacilitates action on the more pressing problems of the \nday\u2014the consequences of Title I\u2019s plain language are \nnot at all \u201csurprising\u201d or \u201cabsurd.\u201d Pet. Br. 27, 47. \nCongress enacted Title I to provide a legal remedy \nfor disabled workers that did not previously exist. See \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(a)(4). At the time, several other \nfederal statutes existed for the protection of employee \nretirement benefits such as ERISA, the Social \nSecurity Act, and the Medicare Act. The Equal \nProtection Clause provided an additional remedy for \npublic employees. See Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, \n522 (2004) (\u201cemphasiz[ing] that the House and Senate \nCommittee \nReports \non \nthe \nADA \nfocused \non \n\u2018[d]iscrimination [in]...employment in the private \nsector,\u2019 and made no mention of discrimination in \npublic employment.\u201d) (emphasis added by the Court). \nAdditionally, numerous common law claims such as \nbreach of contract, promissory estoppel, or fraud in the \ninducement \nalong \nwith \nstate \nstatutory \nand \n\n51 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nunconstitutional takings claims could be brought to \nobtain promised benefits.  \nThus, before the ADA, a disabled employee could \nnot sue her private employer for discrimination, \nbreach of contract, or any of the other above remedies \nif she accepted a job knowing that her contract \nincluded a lesser pension than a similarly situated \nnon-disabled employee. And even if she didn\u2019t know \nabout a secret discriminatory decision applied to her \nduring her employment but later discovered it, there \nwas no law that prohibited such discrimination. The \nADA stepped in to prohibit such discriminatory \npolicies from being applied to current employees and \napplicants. Such policies could dissuade a disabled job \napplicant from accepting that job or force a disabled \nemployee to search elsewhere for a fair pension. And \nin the absence of the ADA, that employee would be \nforced to do so without remedy. Title I\u2019s \u201clanguage [is] \nwell \ndesigned \nto \nhelp \npeople \nget \nand \nkeep \njobs\u2026\u201dWeyer, 198 F.3d at 1112. \nBut an employer who does not discriminate until \npost-employment does not deter employment. If the \nemployer has a facially neutral pension policy that \npromises a pension to all retirees, but the employer \nwithholds the pension from a disabled retiree, then \nthat retiree has a clear breach of a contract claim \nalong with all of the other remedies mentioned above \nunder ERISA, the Social Security Act, etc. Under \nFlorida law, \u201conce a participating member reaches \nretirement status, the benefits under the terms of the \nact in effect at the time of the employee's retirement \nvest.\u201d Bien, 209 So. 3d at 3. \u201cThe contractual \nrelationship may not thereafter be affected or \n\n52 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nadversely \naltered \nby \nsubsequent \nstatutory \nenactments.\u201d Id. \nThus, the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s interpretation does \nnot \u201callow employers to freely discriminate against \ntheir former employees.\u201d Pet. Br. 47. Employers risk \nsignificant liability for allowing their animus against \nthe disabled to lead them to breach their contracts or \nviolate other laws post-employment. The remedies for \nviolating these laws are not always the same as the \nADA\u2019s remedies. But the fact that these remedies pre-\ndated the ADA demonstrates the reasonableness of \nCongress\u2019 decision to focus on the more pressing issue \nof the day for which there was no remedy at all\u2014\ndiscriminatory \npolicies \nthat \nexcluded \ncapable \nindividuals from the workforce simply because they \nwere disabled. Because there are several plausible \nexplanations for the line drawn by the plain text of \nTitle I, Petitioner\u2019s arguments fail the absurd results \ntest. The Eleventh Circuit correctly held that \nPetitioner could not state a claim for disability \ndiscrimination under the ADA.\u0003\n\u0003\n \n\n53 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nCONCLUSION \nFor these reasons, this Court should affirm.  \n \nRespectfully submitted, \nJESSICA C.

This information is crucial for understanding the arguments that are most likely to persuade the Court. Therefore, the Task EIG is very high.

While Stanley was an em-\nployee, the City adopted a policy shortening the dura-\ntion of a post-employment health-insurance subsidy it \nprovides to employees who retire on account of disabil-\nity.  After Stanley retired because of a disability, she filed \nthis suit alleging that the policy violates the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.  The \nquestion presented is: \n \nWhether the court of appeals erred in holding that \nStanley cannot challenge the City\u2019s allegedly discrimi-\nnatory post-employment benefits policy because the ben-\nefits were paid after Stanley was no longer employed. \n \n \n \n \n\n(III) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \nInterest of the United States....................................................... 1 \nStatement ...................................................................................... 2 \nA. \nLegal background ............................................................ 2 \nB. \nFactual background ......................................................... 5 \nC. \nProcedural history ........................................................... 6 \nSummary of argument ................................................................. 8 \nArgument ..................................................................................... 11 \nA. \nFormer employees may enforce Title I if they  \nsuffer prohibited discrimination and file a timely \ncharge .............................................................................. 12 \n1.

STANLEY, PETITIONER \nv. \nCITY OF SANFORD, FLORIDA \n \nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI \nTO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS  \nFOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT \n \nBRIEF FOR THE UNITED STATES  \nAS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING PETITIONER \n \nINTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES \nThis case concerns whether and under what circum-\nstances a former employee can challenge an employer\u2019s \nallegedly discriminatory post-employment benefits pol-\nicy under Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act \nof 1990, 42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.  The Equal Employment \nOpportunity Commission (EEOC) enforces Title I against \nprivate employers, and the Attorney General enforces \nTitle I against state- and local-government employers.  \nSee 42 U.S.C. 12117(a) (incorporating 42 U.S.C. 2000e-\n5(f\u200a)(1)).  The United States accordingly has a substan-\ntial interest in the proper interpretation of Title I.  The \nUnited States participated as an amicus curiae in this \ncase in the court of appeals. \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal Background \nCongress enacted the Americans with Disabilities Act \nof 1990 (ADA), Pub. L. No. 101-336, 104 Stat. 327 (42 \nU.S.C. 12101 et seq.), \u201cto provide a clear and compre-\nhensive national mandate for the elimination of discrim-\nination against individuals with disabilities.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n12101(b)(1).  To achieve that objective, the ADA forbids \ndiscrimination on the basis of disability in \u201cmajor areas\u201d \nof public life, including employment (Title I), public ser-\nvices (Title II), and public accommodations (Title III).  \n42 U.S.C. 12101(b)(4); see PGA Tour, Inc. v. Martin, 532 \nU.S. 661, 675 (2001). \n1. This case concerns Title I\u2019s provisions governing \nemployment.  Congress amended those provisions in the \nADA Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA), Pub. L. No. \n110-325, 122 Stat. 3553, to clarify the ADA and \u201creject\u201d \nholdings of this Court that Congress viewed as adopting \ntoo \u201cnarrow[]\u201d an interpretation of the statute\u2019s \u201cbroad \nscope of protection.\u201d  ADAAA \u00a7 2(a)(4)-(7) and (b)(2)-(5), \n122 Stat. 3553-3554.  As amended, Title I\u2019s \u201c[g]eneral \nrule\u201d provides: \nNo covered entity shall discriminate against a quali-\nfied individual on the basis of disability in regard to \njob application procedures, the hiring, advancement, \nor discharge of employees, employee compensation, \njob training, and other terms, conditions, and privi-\nleges of employment. \n42 U.S.C. 12112(a).  Title I further provides that Section \n12112(a)\u2019s general rule should be construed to prohibit \na variety of specific forms of discrimination, including the \nfailure to make reasonable accommodations.  42 U.S.C. \n12112(b). \n\n3 \n \nThe ADA defines a \u201ccovered entity\u201d to mean, among \nother things, \u201can employer.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 12111(2).  A \u201cqual-\nified individual\u201d means \u201can individual who, with or with-\nout reasonable accommodation, can perform the essen-\ntial functions of the employment position that such indi-\nvidual holds or desires.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 12111(8).  And \u201cdisa-\nbility\u201d means, \u201cwith respect to an individual\u2014(A) a phys-\nical or mental impairment that substantially limits one \nor more major life activities of such individual; (B) a rec-\nord of such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as hav-\ning such an impairment (as described in [42 U.S.C. \n12102(3)]).\u201d  42 U.S.C. 12102(1). \n2. Title I incorporates the enforcement provisions of \nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000e \net seq.  See 42 U.S.C. 12117(a).  Specifically, Title I states \nthat the \u201cpowers, remedies, and procedures set forth in\u201d \nspecified provisions of Title VII, including 42 U.S.C. \n2000e-5, \u201cshall be the powers, remedies, and procedures \n[Title I] provides to the [EEOC], to the Attorney Gen-\neral, or to any person alleging discrimination on the ba-\nsis of disability in violation of\u200a\u201d Title I.  42 U.S.C. 12117(a). \nSection 2000e-5, in turn, authorizes a person alleging \nan \u201cunlawful employment practice\u201d to file a charge with \nthe EEOC.  42 U.S.C. 2000e-5(b).  The charge \u201cshall be \nfiled\u201d within 180 days \u201cafter the alleged unlawful em-\nployment practice occurred.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 2000e-5(e)(1).  \nBut if the \u201calleged unlawful employment practice\u201d oc-\ncurred in a State or political subdivision that has its own \nagency with authority to grant or seek relief, a person \nmust commence proceedings with that agency first.  42 \nU.S.C. 2000e-5(c); see EEOC v. Commercial Office Prods. \nCo., 486 U.S. 107, 111 (1988) (explaining that the EEOC \nmay initiate state or local proceedings on behalf of a \nperson by referring a charge that the person submitted \n\n4 \n \nto the EEOC).  In cases in which a person has \u201cinitially \ninstituted proceedings with [the] State or local agency,\u201d \na charge \u201cshall be filed\u201d with the EEOC within 300 days \n\u201cafter the alleged unlawful employment practice oc-\ncurred\u201d or within 30 days \u201cafter receiving notice that the \nState or local agency has terminated the proceedings,\u201d \nwhichever is earlier.  42 U.S.C. 2000e-5(e)(1). \nIf the EEOC determines that \u201cthere is not reasona-\nble cause to believe that the charge is true, it shall dis-\nmiss the charge and promptly notify\u201d the individual who \nfiled the charge.  42 U.S.C. 2000e-5(b).  That notice is \nsometimes called a \u201cright-to-sue letter.\u201d  If, within 180 \ndays, the EEOC has not resolved the matter through \nconciliation and the EEOC (or the Attorney General in \ncases involving public employers) has not brought a civil \naction, the individual is entitled to a right-to-sue letter \nupon request.  42 U.S.C. 2000e-5(f)(1); see 29 C.F.R. \n1601.28(a)(1).  Within 90 days of that notice, the individ-\nual may file a civil action.  42 U.S.C. 2000e-5(f\u200a)(1) and (3).   \nThe Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 (Fair Pay \nAct), Pub. L. No. 111-2, \u00a7 3, 123 Stat. 5-6, amended Sec-\ntion 2000e-5(e) to add the following provision: \nFor purposes of [Section 2000e-5], an unlawful em-\nployment practice occurs, with respect to discrimina-\ntion in compensation  * * * , [1] when a discrimina-\ntory compensation decision or other practice is \nadopted, [2] when an individual becomes subject to a \ndiscriminatory compensation decision or other prac-\ntice, or [3] when an individual is affected by applica-\ntion of a discriminatory compensation decision or \nother practice, including each time wages, benefits, \nor other compensation is paid, resulting in whole or \nin part from such a decision or other practice. \n\n5 \n \n42 U.S.C. 2000e-5(e)(3)(A).  Congress specified that the \nforegoing provision \u201cshall apply to claims of discrimina-\ntion in compensation brought under\u201d Title I of the ADA.  \nFair Pay Act \u00a7 5(a), 123 Stat. 6. \nB. Factual Background \nIn 1999, petitioner Karyn Stanley began working as \na firefighter in the City of Sanford\u2019s Fire Department.  \nCompl. \u00b6\u00b6 4(b), 13-14.  The City provides its employees \na health-insurance subsidy as a \u201cfringe benefit of em-\nployment.\u201d  Compl. \u00b6 23.  Through the subsidy, the City \npays a portion of its employees\u2019 health-insurance premi-\nums for a certain period after they retire.  Compl. \u00b6 19. \nWhen Stanley was hired, the City provided the ben-\nefit until age 65 to both employees who retired after 25 \nyears of service and employees who retired on account \nof disability.  Compl. \u00b6 19.  In 2003, however, the City \nchanged its policy.  Compl. \u00b6 20.  Under the new policy, \nemployees who retire after 25 years of service are still \nentitled to the benefit until they turn 65.  Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 20, \n21.  In contrast, employees who retire on account of \u201cdis-\nability\u201d and who \u201cmeet the criteria for disability retire-\nment\u201d are entitled to the benefit only \u201cuntil the disabled \nretiree receives Medicare benefits or until 24 months \nhave elapsed from the date of retirement, whichever \ncomes first.\u201d  Compl. \u00b6 24. \nIn 2016, Stanley was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s dis-\nease.  Pet. App. 2a; D. Ct. Doc. 38-4, at 1 (Aug. 3, 2021).  \nEventually, \u201cthe physical demands and requirements\u201d \nof being a firefighter left her no \u201cchoice but to retire due \nto her disability.\u201d  Compl. \u00b6 16.  On November 1, 2018, \nthe City placed Stanley on \u201cdisability retirement\u201d and \nbegan providing her a post-employment monthly health-\ninsurance subsidy of about $1000.  Ibid.; see Compl.  \n\u00b6\u00b6 4(b), 26.  Under the policy adopted in 2003, Stanley \n\n6 \n \nwas scheduled to receive the benefit for 24 months\u2014i.e., \nuntil November 2020, about 15 years before reaching the \nage of 65.  Compl. \u00b6 26. \nC. Procedural History \n1. After retiring, Stanley filed charges with the Flor-\nida Commission on Human Relations and the EEOC al-\nleging that the City\u2019s 2003 benefits policy discriminated \non the basis of disability.  Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 6, 9.  Stanley filed \nher charge with the EEOC on June 3, 2019\u2014214 days \nafter the City had placed her on disability retirement.  \nCompl. \u00b6\u00b6 6, 16.  On January 13, 2020, the EEOC dis-\nmissed the charge and notified Stanley of her right to \nsue.  Compl. \u00b6 7. \nOn April 11, 2020\u2014within 90 days after receiving the \nright-to-sue letter\u2014Stanley brought suit against the \nCity in federal district court.  Compl. \u00b6 8.  As relevant \nhere, Stanley alleged that the City\u2019s 2003 benefits policy \n\u201ccontain[ed] a disability-based distinction and [wa]s dis-\ncriminatory on its face\u201d because it provided the health-\ninsurance subsidy to \u201cdisabled retirees\u201d for \u201conly up to \n24 months.\u201d  Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 30-31.  Stanley alleged that \u201c[b]y \ntaking away the [subsidy] before age 65 from its disa-\nbled retirees,\u201d the City had violated the ADA.  Compl. \n\u00b6 37.1 \n2. The district court granted the City\u2019s motion to dis-\nmiss Stanley\u2019s ADA claim.  Pet. App. 20a-31a.  The court \nunderstood Gonzales v. Garner Food Services, Inc., 89 \nF.3d 1523 (11th Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1229 \n(1997), to have held that because Title I prohibits dis-\ncrimination against a \u201cqualified individual\u201d and defines \n \n1 Stanley also brought other claims, which the district court dis-\nmissed or rejected on summary judgment.  Pet. App. 23a-26a; J.A. \n37-45.  Those claims are not at issue here. \n\n7 \n \nthat term as someone who is able to perform the essen-\ntial functions of the employment position that she holds \nor desires, a \u201cdisabled former employee\u201d may not bring \na claim \u201cbased on actions that occurred after the em-\nployment relationship ended.\u201d  Pet. App. 24a.  The court \ntook the view that \u201cthe alleged discrimination\u201d in this \ncase \u201cdid not occur until\u201d Stanley had retired.  Id. at 26a.  \nThe court therefore concluded that Gonzales required \ndismissal of her ADA claim.  Ibid. \n3. The court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 1a-19a.  \nLike the district court, the court of appeals understood \nGonzales to have held that, \u201c[t]o fall within Title I\u2019s anti-\ndiscrimination provision, a plaintiff\u200a\u2019s claim must de-\npend on an act committed by the defendant while the \nplaintiff was either working for the defendant or seek-\ning to work for the defendant\u201d\u2014meaning that \u201ca former \nemployee could not sue for alleged discrimination in \npost-employment fringe benefits.\u201d  Id. at 8a-9a.  After \nconcluding that \u201cGonzales is still good law,\u201d the court \nasked \u201cwhether Stanley was a disabled employee or job \napplicant capable of performing the job at the time of the \nalleged discrimination.\u201d  Id. at 16a.  The court identified \nthree \u201cpoints in time\u201d when Stanley could \u201ctheoretically \nroot her Title I claim\u201d:  \u201c(1) in October 2003, when the City \namended the benefits plan; (2) whenever she first be-\ncame subject to the allegedly discriminatory provisions \nof the benefits plan as a disabled employee; or (3) in De-\ncember 2020, when she was affected by the termination \nof the health insurance premium payments.\u201d  Ibid. \nThe court of appeals held that \u201c[n]either option 1 nor \noption 3 works.\u201d  Pet. App. 16a.  With respect to \u201coption \n1,\u201d the court acknowledged that Stanley \u201cwas employed \nby the City in October 2003.\u201d  Ibid.  But the court under-\nstood Stanley to have \u201cconcede[d]\u201d that \u201cher claim can-\n\n8 \n \nnot turn on the 2003 amendment to the benefits plan be-\ncause she was not yet disabled at that time.\u201d  Ibid.  With \nrespect to \u201coption 3,\u201d the court acknowledged that Stan-\nley \u201cwas disabled at the time of the December 2020 ter-\nmination of the health insurance premium payments.\u201d  \nIbid.  But the court concluded that her claim cannot turn \non that termination because \u201cby that time,\u201d she \u201cdid not \nhold or desire to hold, nor was she qualified to hold, an \n\u2018employment position\u2019 with the City.\u201d  Ibid. \nThe court of appeals declined to consider option 2\u2014\ni.e., that \u201cStanley suffered discrimination as a disabled \nemployee  * * *  while working for the City in the two \nyears after her Parkinson\u2019s diagnosis.\u201d  Pet. App. 17a.  \nIn the court\u2019s view, Stanley \u201cdid not make [that] argu-\nment to the district court and specifically disclaimed the \nargument in [her] own brief\u200a\u201d on appeal.  Id. at 18a.  And \nalthough the court of appeals understood the United \nStates to have raised the argument in an amicus brief, \nthe court declined to \u201cconsider arguments raised only \nby\u201d an amicus.  Ibid.  Because the court determined that \n\u201cStanley cannot establish that the City committed any \ndiscriminatory acts against her while she could perform \nthe essential functions of a job that she held or desired \nto hold,\u201d it concluded that \u201cher Title I claim fails.\u201d  Ibid. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nTitle I of the ADA prohibits \u201cdiscriminat[ion] against \na qualified individual on the basis of disability\u201d in \u201cem-\nployee compensation\u201d and \u201cother terms, conditions, and \nprivileges of employment.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 12112(a).  The \ncourt of appeals held that Stanley cannot challenge the \nCity\u2019s allegedly discriminatory post-employment bene-\nfits policy under Title I because the benefits were paid \nafter Stanley was no longer employed.  Pet. App. 2a.  \nThat holding is incorrect. \n\n9 \n \nA.  The ADA authorizes \u201cany person alleging discrim-\nination on the basis of disability in violation of\u200a\u201d Title I \nto invoke the remedies available under Title VII.  42 \nU.S.C. 12117(a).  Former employees are plainly among \nthe \u201cperson[s]\u201d who may invoke those remedies.  Ibid.  \nBut like any other person seeking to enforce Title I, a \nformer employee must adequately allege unlawful dis-\ncrimination and file a timely charge with the EEOC. \nB.  This case comes to the Court on the assumption \nthat Stanley is a \u201cperson\u201d entitled to sue under 42 U.S.C. \n12117(a) and that she has adequately alleged that the \nCity\u2019s post-employment benefits policy facially \u201cdis-\ncriminate[s]  * * *  on the basis of disability in regard to  \n* * *  employee compensation  * * *  and other terms, \nconditions, and privileges of employment,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n12112(a).  The only issue before this Court is whether the \nalleged discrimination was \u201cagainst a qualified individ-\nual.\u201d  Ibid. \nThe court of appeals interpreted Title I\u2019s definition \nof \u201cqualified individual\u201d to mean that a plaintiff \u201cmust \n\u2018hold[] or desire[]\u2019 an employment position with the de-\nfendant at the time of the defendant\u2019s allegedly wrong-\nful act.\u201d  Pet. App. 2a (quoting 42 U.S.C. 12111(8)).  Here, \nhowever, Stanley did hold a job (and was capable of per-\nforming its essential functions) when the City adopted \nthe challenged policy in 2003 and maintained it as part \nof her terms and conditions of employment thereafter.  \nThus, even if the court\u2019s interpretation were correct, \nStanley adequately alleged that she was the victim of \ndiscrimination as a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d  And because \nStanley filed her charge when she was later \u201csubject to\u201d \nor \u201caffected by\u201d the allegedly facially discriminatory \npolicy, 42 U.S.C. 2000e-5(e)(3)(A), the charge was timely \nunder the Fair Pay Act. \n\n10 \n \nC.  The court of appeals held that Stanley\u2019s \u201cclaim \ncannot turn on\u201d the 2003 adoption of the policy \u201cbecause \nshe was not yet disabled at that time.\u201d  Pet. App. 16a.  \nBut Title I does not require the victim of discrimination \non the basis of disability to have a disability at the time \nof the allegedly discriminatory act.  Congress clarified any \nambiguity on that s\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

While Stanley was an em-\nployee, the City adopted a policy shortening the dura-\ntion of a post-employment health-insurance subsidy it \nprovides to employees who retire on account of disabil-\nity.  After Stanley retired because of a disability, she filed \nthis suit alleging that the policy violates the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.  The \nquestion presented is: \n \nWhether the court of appeals erred in holding that \nStanley cannot challenge the City\u2019s allegedly discrimi-\nnatory post-employment benefits policy because the ben-\nefits were paid after Stanley was no longer employed. \n \n \n \n \n\n(III) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \nInterest of the United States....................................................... 1 \nStatement ...................................................................................... 2 \nA. \nLegal background ............................................................ 2 \nB. \nFactual background ......................................................... 5 \nC. \nProcedural history ........................................................... 6 \nSummary of argument ................................................................. 8 \nArgument ..................................................................................... 11 \nA. \nFormer employees may enforce Title I if they  \nsuffer prohibited discrimination and file a timely \ncharge .............................................................................. 12 \n1.

The Equal Employment \nOpportunity Commission (EEOC) enforces Title I against \nprivate employers, and the Attorney General enforces \nTitle I against state- and local-government employers.  \nSee 42 U.S.C. 12117(a) (incorporating 42 U.S.C. 2000e-\n5(f\u200a)(1)).  The United States accordingly has a substan-\ntial interest in the proper interpretation of Title I.  The \nUnited States participated as an amicus curiae in this \ncase in the court of appeals. \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal Background \nCongress enacted the Americans with Disabilities Act \nof 1990 (ADA), Pub. L. No. 101-336, 104 Stat. 327 (42 \nU.S.C. 12101 et seq.), \u201cto provide a clear and compre-\nhensive national mandate for the elimination of discrim-\nination against individuals with disabilities.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n12101(b)(1).  To achieve that objective, the ADA forbids \ndiscrimination on the basis of disability in \u201cmajor areas\u201d \nof public life, including employment (Title I), public ser-\nvices (Title II), and public accommodations (Title III).  \n42 U.S.C. 12101(b)(4); see PGA Tour, Inc. v. Martin, 532 \nU.S. 661, 675 (2001). \n1. This case concerns Title I\u2019s provisions governing \nemployment.  Congress amended those provisions in the \nADA Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA), Pub. L. No. \n110-325, 122 Stat. 3553, to clarify the ADA and \u201creject\u201d \nholdings of this Court that Congress viewed as adopting \ntoo \u201cnarrow[]\u201d an interpretation of the statute\u2019s \u201cbroad \nscope of protection.\u201d  ADAAA \u00a7 2(a)(4)-(7) and (b)(2)-(5), \n122 Stat. 3553-3554.  As amended, Title I\u2019s \u201c[g]eneral \nrule\u201d provides: \nNo covered entity shall discriminate against a quali-\nfied individual on the basis of disability in regard to \njob application procedures, the hiring, advancement, \nor discharge of employees, employee compensation, \njob training, and other terms, conditions, and privi-\nleges of employment. \n42 U.S.C. 12112(a).  Title I further provides that Section \n12112(a)\u2019s general rule should be construed to prohibit \na variety of specific forms of discrimination, including the \nfailure to make reasonable accommodations.  42 U.S.C. \n12112(b). \n\n3 \n \nThe ADA defines a \u201ccovered entity\u201d to mean, among \nother things, \u201can employer.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 12111(2).  A \u201cqual-\nified individual\u201d means \u201can individual who, with or with-\nout reasonable accommodation, can perform the essen-\ntial functions of the employment position that such indi-\nvidual holds or desires.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 12111(8).  And \u201cdisa-\nbility\u201d means, \u201cwith respect to an individual\u2014(A) a phys-\nical or mental impairment that substantially limits one \nor more major life activities of such individual; (B) a rec-\nord of such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as hav-\ning such an impairment (as described in [42 U.S.C. \n12102(3)]).\u201d  42 U.S.C. 12102(1). \n2. Title I incorporates the enforcement provisions of \nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000e \net seq.  See 42 U.S.C. 12117(a).  Specifically, Title I states \nthat the \u201cpowers, remedies, and procedures set forth in\u201d \nspecified provisions of Title VII, including 42 U.S.C. \n2000e-5, \u201cshall be the powers, remedies, and procedures \n[Title I] provides to the [EEOC], to the Attorney Gen-\neral, or to any person alleging discrimination on the ba-\nsis of disability in violation of\u200a\u201d Title I.  42 U.S.C. 12117(a). \nSection 2000e-5, in turn, authorizes a person alleging \nan \u201cunlawful employment practice\u201d to file a charge with \nthe EEOC.  42 U.S.C. 2000e-5(b).  The charge \u201cshall be \nfiled\u201d within 180 days \u201cafter the alleged unlawful em-\nployment practice occurred.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 2000e-5(e)(1).  \nBut if the \u201calleged unlawful employment practice\u201d oc-\ncurred in a State or political subdivision that has its own \nagency with authority to grant or seek relief, a person \nmust commence proceedings with that agency first.  42 \nU.S.C. 2000e-5(c); see EEOC v. Commercial Office Prods. \nCo., 486 U.S. 107, 111 (1988) (explaining that the EEOC \nmay initiate state or local proceedings on behalf of a \nperson by referring a charge that the person submitted \n\n4 \n \nto the EEOC).  In cases in which a person has \u201cinitially \ninstituted proceedings with [the] State or local agency,\u201d \na charge \u201cshall be filed\u201d with the EEOC within 300 days \n\u201cafter the alleged unlawful employment practice oc-\ncurred\u201d or within 30 days \u201cafter receiving notice that the \nState or local agency has terminated the proceedings,\u201d \nwhichever is earlier.  42 U.S.C. 2000e-5(e)(1). \nIf the EEOC determines that \u201cthere is not reasona-\nble cause to believe that the charge is true, it shall dis-\nmiss the charge and promptly notify\u201d the individual who \nfiled the charge.  42 U.S.C. 2000e-5(b).  That notice is \nsometimes called a \u201cright-to-sue letter.\u201d  If, within 180 \ndays, the EEOC has not resolved the matter through \nconciliation and the EEOC (or the Attorney General in \ncases involving public employers) has not brought a civil \naction, the individual is entitled to a right-to-sue letter \nupon request.  42 U.S.C. 2000e-5(f)(1); see 29 C.F.R. \n1601.28(a)(1).  Within 90 days of that notice, the individ-\nual may file a civil action.  42 U.S.C. 2000e-5(f\u200a)(1) and (3).   \nThe Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 (Fair Pay \nAct), Pub. L. No. 111-2, \u00a7 3, 123 Stat. 5-6, amended Sec-\ntion 2000e-5(e) to add the following provision: \nFor purposes of [Section 2000e-5], an unlawful em-\nployment practice occurs, with respect to discrimina-\ntion in compensation  * * * , [1] when a discrimina-\ntory compensation decision or other practice is \nadopted, [2] when an individual becomes subject to a \ndiscriminatory compensation decision or other prac-\ntice, or [3] when an individual is affected by applica-\ntion of a discriminatory compensation decision or \nother practice, including each time wages, benefits, \nor other compensation is paid, resulting in whole or \nin part from such a decision or other practice. \n\n5 \n \n42 U.S.C. 2000e-5(e)(3)(A).  Congress specified that the \nforegoing provision \u201cshall apply to claims of discrimina-\ntion in compensation brought under\u201d Title I of the ADA.  \nFair Pay Act \u00a7 5(a), 123 Stat. 6. \nB. Factual Background \nIn 1999, petitioner Karyn Stanley began working as \na firefighter in the City of Sanford\u2019s Fire Department.  \nCompl. \u00b6\u00b6 4(b), 13-14.  The City provides its employees \na health-insurance subsidy as a \u201cfringe benefit of em-\nployment.\u201d  Compl. \u00b6 23.  Through the subsidy, the City \npays a portion of its employees\u2019 health-insurance premi-\nums for a certain period after they retire.  Compl. \u00b6 19. \nWhen Stanley was hired, the City provided the ben-\nefit until age 65 to both employees who retired after 25 \nyears of service and employees who retired on account \nof disability.  Compl. \u00b6 19.  In 2003, however, the City \nchanged its policy.  Compl. \u00b6 20.  Under the new policy, \nemployees who retire after 25 years of service are still \nentitled to the benefit until they turn 65.  Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 20, \n21.  In contrast, employees who retire on account of \u201cdis-\nability\u201d and who \u201cmeet the criteria for disability retire-\nment\u201d are entitled to the benefit only \u201cuntil the disabled \nretiree receives Medicare benefits or until 24 months \nhave elapsed from the date of retirement, whichever \ncomes first.\u201d  Compl. \u00b6 24. \nIn 2016, Stanley was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s dis-\nease.  Pet. App. 2a; D. Ct. Doc. 38-4, at 1 (Aug. 3, 2021).  \nEventually, \u201cthe physical demands and requirements\u201d \nof being a firefighter left her no \u201cchoice but to retire due \nto her disability.\u201d  Compl. \u00b6 16.  On November 1, 2018, \nthe City placed Stanley on \u201cdisability retirement\u201d and \nbegan providing her a post-employment monthly health-\ninsurance subsidy of about $1000.  Ibid.; see Compl.  \n\u00b6\u00b6 4(b), 26.  Under the policy adopted in 2003, Stanley \n\n6 \n \nwas scheduled to receive the benefit for 24 months\u2014i.e., \nuntil November 2020, about 15 years before reaching the \nage of 65.  Compl. \u00b6 26. \nC. Procedural History \n1. After retiring, Stanley filed charges with the Flor-\nida Commission on Human Relations and the EEOC al-\nleging that the City\u2019s 2003 benefits policy discriminated \non the basis of disability.  Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 6, 9.  Stanley filed \nher charge with the EEOC on June 3, 2019\u2014214 days \nafter the City had placed her on disability retirement.  \nCompl. \u00b6\u00b6 6, 16.  On January 13, 2020, the EEOC dis-\nmissed the charge and notified Stanley of her right to \nsue.  Compl. \u00b6 7. \nOn April 11, 2020\u2014within 90 days after receiving the \nright-to-sue letter\u2014Stanley brought suit against the \nCity in federal district court.  Compl. \u00b6 8.  As relevant \nhere, Stanley alleged that the City\u2019s 2003 benefits policy \n\u201ccontain[ed] a disability-based distinction and [wa]s dis-\ncriminatory on its face\u201d because it provided the health-\ninsurance subsidy to \u201cdisabled retirees\u201d for \u201conly up to \n24 months.\u201d  Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 30-31.  Stanley alleged that \u201c[b]y \ntaking away the [subsidy] before age 65 from its disa-\nbled retirees,\u201d the City had violated the ADA.  Compl. \n\u00b6 37.1 \n2. The district court granted the City\u2019s motion to dis-\nmiss Stanley\u2019s ADA claim.  Pet. App. 20a-31a.  The court \nunderstood Gonzales v. Garner Food Services, Inc., 89 \nF.3d 1523 (11th Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1229 \n(1997), to have held that because Title I prohibits dis-\ncrimination against a \u201cqualified individual\u201d and defines \n \n1 Stanley also brought other claims, which the district court dis-\nmissed or rejected on summary judgment.  Pet. App. 23a-26a; J.A. \n37-45.  Those claims are not at issue here. \n\n7 \n \nthat term as someone who is able to perform the essen-\ntial functions of the employment position that she holds \nor desires, a \u201cdisabled former employee\u201d may not bring \na claim \u201cbased on actions that occurred after the em-\nployment relationship ended.\u201d  Pet. App. 24a.  The court \ntook the view that \u201cthe alleged discrimination\u201d in this \ncase \u201cdid not occur until\u201d Stanley had retired.  Id. at 26a.  \nThe court therefore concluded that Gonzales required \ndismissal of her ADA claim.  Ibid. \n3. The court of appeals affirmed.  Pet. App. 1a-19a.  \nLike the district court, the court of appeals understood \nGonzales to have held that, \u201c[t]o fall within Title I\u2019s anti-\ndiscrimination provision, a plaintiff\u200a\u2019s claim must de-\npend on an act committed by the defendant while the \nplaintiff was either working for the defendant or seek-\ning to work for the defendant\u201d\u2014meaning that \u201ca former \nemployee could not sue for alleged discrimination in \npost-employment fringe benefits.\u201d  Id. at 8a-9a.  After \nconcluding that \u201cGonzales is still good law,\u201d the court \nasked \u201cwhether Stanley was a disabled employee or job \napplicant capable of performing the job at the time of the \nalleged discrimination.\u201d  Id. at 16a.  The court identified \nthree \u201cpoints in time\u201d when Stanley could \u201ctheoretically \nroot her Title I claim\u201d:  \u201c(1) in October 2003, when the City \namended the benefits plan; (2) whenever she first be-\ncame subject to the allegedly discriminatory provisions \nof the benefits plan as a disabled employee; or (3) in De-\ncember 2020, when she was affected by the termination \nof the health insurance premium payments.\u201d  Ibid. \nThe court of appeals held that \u201c[n]either option 1 nor \noption 3 works.\u201d  Pet. App. 16a.  With respect to \u201coption \n1,\u201d the court acknowledged that Stanley \u201cwas employed \nby the City in October 2003.\u201d  Ibid.  But the court under-\nstood Stanley to have \u201cconcede[d]\u201d that \u201cher claim can-\n\n8 \n \nnot turn on the 2003 amendment to the benefits plan be-\ncause she was not yet disabled at that time.\u201d  Ibid.  With \nrespect to \u201coption 3,\u201d the court acknowledged that Stan-\nley \u201cwas disabled at the time of the December 2020 ter-\nmination of the health insurance premium payments.\u201d  \nIbid.  But the court concluded that her claim cannot turn \non that termination because \u201cby that time,\u201d she \u201cdid not \nhold or desire to hold, nor was she qualified to hold, an \n\u2018employment position\u2019 with the City.\u201d  Ibid. \nThe court of appeals declined to consider option 2\u2014\ni.e., that \u201cStanley suffered discrimination as a disabled \nemployee  * * *  while working for the City in the two \nyears after her Parkinson\u2019s diagnosis.\u201d  Pet. App. 17a.  \nIn the court\u2019s view, Stanley \u201cdid not make [that] argu-\nment to the district court and specifically disclaimed the \nargument in [her] own brief\u200a\u201d on appeal.  Id. at 18a.  And \nalthough the court of appeals understood the United \nStates to have raised the argument in an amicus brief, \nthe court declined to \u201cconsider arguments raised only \nby\u201d an amicus.  Ibid.  Because the court determined that \n\u201cStanley cannot establish that the City committed any \ndiscriminatory acts against her while she could perform \nthe essential functions of a job that she held or desired \nto hold,\u201d it concluded that \u201cher Title I claim fails.\u201d  Ibid. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nTitle I of the ADA prohibits \u201cdiscriminat[ion] against \na qualified individual on the basis of disability\u201d in \u201cem-\nployee compensation\u201d and \u201cother terms, conditions, and \nprivileges of employment.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 12112(a).  The \ncourt of appeals held that Stanley cannot challenge the \nCity\u2019s allegedly discriminatory post-employment bene-\nfits policy under Title I because the benefits were paid \nafter Stanley was no longer employed.  Pet. App. 2a.  \nThat holding is incorrect. \n\n9 \n \nA.  The ADA authorizes \u201cany person alleging discrim-\nination on the basis of disability in violation of\u200a\u201d Title I \nto invoke the remedies available under Title VII.  42 \nU.S.C. 12117(a).  Former employees are plainly among \nthe \u201cperson[s]\u201d who may invoke those remedies.  Ibid.  \nBut like any other person seeking to enforce Title I, a \nformer employee must adequately allege unlawful dis-\ncrimination and file a timely charge with the EEOC. \nB.  This case comes to the Court on the assumption \nthat Stanley is a \u201cperson\u201d entitled to sue under 42 U.S.C. \n12117(a) and that she has adequately alleged that the \nCity\u2019s post-employment benefits policy facially \u201cdis-\ncriminate[s]  * * *  on the basis of disability in regard to  \n* * *  employee compensation  * * *  and other terms, \nconditions, and privileges of employment,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n12112(a).  The only issue before this Court is whether the \nalleged discrimination was \u201cagainst a qualified individ-\nual.\u201d  Ibid. \nThe court of appeals interpreted Title I\u2019s definition \nof \u201cqualified individual\u201d to mean that a plaintiff \u201cmust \n\u2018hold[] or desire[]\u2019 an employment position with the de-\nfendant at the time of the defendant\u2019s allegedly wrong-\nful act.\u201d  Pet. App. 2a (quoting 42 U.S.C. 12111(8)).  Here, \nhowever, Stanley did hold a job (and was capable of per-\nforming its essential functions) when the City adopted \nthe challenged policy in 2003 and maintained it as part \nof her terms and conditions of employment thereafter.  \nThus, even if the court\u2019s interpretation were correct, \nStanley adequately alleged that she was the victim of \ndiscrimination as a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d  And because \nStanley filed her charge when she was later \u201csubject to\u201d \nor \u201caffected by\u201d the allegedly facially discriminatory \npolicy, 42 U.S.C. 2000e-5(e)(3)(A), the charge was timely \nunder the Fair Pay Act. \n\n10 \n \nC.  The court of appeals held that Stanley\u2019s \u201cclaim \ncannot turn on\u201d the 2003 adoption of the policy \u201cbecause \nshe was not yet disabled at that time.\u201d  Pet. App. 16a.  \nBut Title I does not require the victim of discrimination \non the basis of disability to have a disability at the time \nof the allegedly discriminatory act.  Congress clarified any \nambiguity on that score when it amended Title I in 2008.  \nAs originally enacted, Section 12112(a) prohibited \u201cdis-\ncriminat[ion] against a qualified individual with a disa-\nbility because of the disability of such individual.\u201d  ADA \n\u00a7 102(a), 104 Stat. 331 (emphasis added).  In 2008, Con-\ngress struck the italicized words and replaced them with \nthe phrase \u201con the basis of disability.\u201d  ADAAA \u00a7 5(a)(1), \n122 Stat. 3557.  That change makes clear that a Title I \nplaintiff need not allege that she had a disability at the \ntime of the disability-based discrimination. \nIn any event, even if Title I required a plaintiff to \nestablish that she had a disability at the time of the al-\nleged discrimination, that requirement would be satis-\nfied here.  Stanley alleges that the City maintained a fa-\ncially discriminatory benefits policy as part of the terms \nand conditions of her employment throughout her post-\n2003 tenure\u2014including the period after she was diag-\nnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease in 2016, during which it \neventually became apparent that Stanley would be forced \nto take disability retirement. \nD.  The fact that Stanley was an employee perform-\ning the essential functions of her job when the City en-\ngaged in the alleged discrimination suffices to resolve \nthe question presented.  But if this Court goes on to con-\nsider whether a Title I plaintiff must hold or desire a job \nat the time of the defendant\u2019s allegedly wrongful act, it \nshould hold that Title I prohibits discrimination in post-\nemployment benefits even if the discrimination occurs \n\n11 \n \nonly after the plaintiff is no longer employed.  When  \nan employer makes a discriminatory change in a plain-\ntiff\u200a\u2019s post-employment benefits, it retroactively alters \nthe plaintiff\u200a\u2019s terms or conditions of employment and \nchanges the compensation she earned as an employee \nperforming the essential functions of her job\u2014that is, \nas a qualified individual.  Such discrimination is natu-\nrally described as discrimination \u201cagainst a qualified in-\ndividual,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 12112(a), even if the individual is no \nlonger employed. \nARGUMENT \nThis case presents the question whether and under \nwhat circumstances a \u201cformer employee\u201d may \u201csue un-\nder Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act for \ndiscrimination in [the] post-employment distribution of \nfringe benefits\u201d earned during employment.  Pet. App. \n2a.  Although post-employment benefits are unquestion-\nably a critical aspect of the employment relationship, \nthe court of appeals held that Stanley could not chal-\nlenge the City\u2019s alleged facial discrimination in the ad-\nministration of those benefits.  The court reached that \ncounterintuitive result based on Title I\u2019s definition of \n\u201cqualified individual,\u201d holding that it requires a plaintiff \nto hold or desire a job at the time of the defendant\u2019s al-\nlegedly wrongful act and that Stanley cannot satisfy \nthat requirement because she was retired at the time of \nthe alleged discrimination.  That was doubly mistaken. \nMost obviously, Stanley alleges that the City adopted \nand maintained a facially discriminatory policy as part \nof her terms and conditions of employment while she \nwas employed.  Stanley was clearly a \u201cqualified individ-\nual\u201d at the time of those allegedly wrongful acts.  And \nalthough the benefits she earned during her employ-\nment were not payable until after she retired, the Fair \n\n12 \n \nPay Act makes clear that a plaintiff may sue when she \n\u201cbecomes subject to\u201d or \u201cis affected by\u201d an allegedly \ndiscriminatory compensation or benefits policy\u2014even if \nthat policy was adopted years earlier.  42 U.S.C. 2000e-\n5(e)(3)(A).  That is just what Stanley seeks to do here. \nIn any event, the court of appeals was wrong to con-\nclude that a Title I plaintiff must hold or desire a job at \nthe time of the defendant\u2019s allegedly wrongful act.  \nPost-employment benefits are earned during an em-\nployee\u2019s tenure as a qualified individual performing the \nessential functions of her job.  If an employer later dis-\ncriminates in the distribution of those benefits\u2014by, say, \nterminating a retiree\u2019s pension or health insurance be-\ncause she has a disability\u2014it has discriminated against \na qualified individual within the meaning of Title I.  \nA. Former Employees May Enforce Title I If They Suffer \nProhibited Discrimination And File A Timely Charge  \nThe answer to the question presented in this case \nturns on the interaction of separate statutory provisions \ngoverning (1) who may enforce Title I\u2019s prohibition on \ndiscrimination, (2) what counts as unlawful discrimina-\ntion, and (3) when a charge of unlawful discrimination \nmust be filed.  We begin by setting forth those require-\nments and explaining how they operate together.  In \nshort, the Act makes clear that a former employee may \nenforce Title I\u2019s prohibition on discrimination\u2014but like \nany other person seeking to enforce that prohibition, a \nformer employee must adequately allege unlawful dis-\ncrimination and file a timely charge. \n1. Former employees are among the \u201cpersons\u201d who may \nenforce Title I\u2019s prohibition on discrimination  \nTitle I\u2019s prohibition on discrimination is set forth in \n42 U.S.C. 12112(a), a section entitled \u201cGeneral rule.\u201d  \n\n13 \n \nSee ADA \u00a7 102, 104 Stat. 331.  That section proscribes \ncertain actions by employers, but it does not specify who \nmay enforce those proscriptions.  Instead, Congress ad-\ndressed enforcement in a separate provision of Title I:  \n42 U.S.C. 12117, entitled \u201cEnforcement.\u201d  See ADA \u00a7 107, \n104 Stat. 336.  Section 12117 states that the \u201cpowers, rem-\nedies, and procedures\u201d set forth in 42 U.S.C. 2000e-5 \nand other provisions of Title VII \u201cshall be the powers, \nremedies, and procedures\u201d Title I provides to \u201cany per-\nson alleging discrimination on the basis of disability in \nviolation of\u200a\u201d Title I.  42 U.S.C. 12117(a).  Section 2000e-5, \nin turn, provides that a person alleging \u201can unlawful em-\nployment practice\u201d may challenge it\u2014first by filing a \ncharge with the EEOC and later by filing a civil action.  \n42 U.S.C. 2000e-5(b); see 42 U.S.C. 2000e-5(f\u200a)(1). \nNothing in Section 12117 (or the provisions of Title \nVII it incorporates) bars former employees from en-\nforcing Title I\u2019s prohibition on discrimination.  To the \ncontrary, Title I plainly contemplates that former em-\nployees will invoke the statute\u2019s enforcement provisions.  \nAfter all, one of the employment practices that Title I \nproscribes is a discriminatory \u201cdischarge.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n12112(a).  Employees who are unlawfully terminated of-\nten can challenge their discharges\u2014and seek \u201crein-\nstatement\u201d as a remedy, 42 U.S.C. 2000e-5(g)(1)\u2014only \nas former employees.  Accordingly, in Robinson v. Shell \nOil Co., 519 U.S. 337 (1997), this Court recognized that \nthe \u201clanguage\u201d of Section 2000e-5(g)(1) \u201cnecessarily re-\nfers to former employees\u201d and contemplates that \u201cfor-\nmer employees will make use of the remedial mecha-\nnisms\u201d provided in Section 2000e-5.  Id. at 342, 345.  For-\nmer employees are thus among the \u201cperson[s]\u201d who may \nenforce Title I\u2019s prohibition on discrimination.  42 U.S.C. \n12117(a). \n\n14 \n \n2. Former employees must adequately allege each \nelement of unlawful discrimination under Title I \nAlthough Section 12112 does not specify who may en-\nforce its prohibition on discrimination, it does define \nwhat counts as unlawful discrimination under Title I.  \nSection 12112(a)\u2019s \u201c[g]eneral rule\u201d prohibits an employer \nfrom \u201cdiscriminat[ing] against a qualified individual on \nthe basis of disability in regard to job application proce-\ndures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employ-\nees, employee compensation, job training, and other \nterms, conditions, and privileges of employment.\u201d  42 \nU.S.C. 12112(a).  Section 12112(b) then specifies that the \ndiscrimination prohibited by Section 12112(a) includes \nnot only disparate treatment, but also practices such as \nadopting policies that have a disparate impact or failing \nto make reasonable accommodations.  See, e.g., Raytheon \nCo. v. Hernandez, 540 U.S. 44, 52-53 (2003) (disparate \nimpact); US Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. 391, 396 \n(2002) (reasonable accommodations). \nLike any other person seeking to enforce Title I\u2019s \nprohibition on discrimination, a former employee must \nadequately allege each element of a claim of unlawful \ndiscrimination under Section 12112.  Different types of \nTitle I claims require the plaintiff to establish different \nelements.  Here, Stanley alleges that the City engaged \nin disparate treatment in violation of Section 12112(a)\u2019s \ngeneral rule.  Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 30, 36-38.  Such a claim has three \nelements. \nFirst, the plaintiff must allege that the employer has \n\u201cdiscriminate[d]  * * *  on the basis of disability,\u201d 42 \nU.S.C. 12112(a), by engaging in disparate treatment.  \nThe \u201ccentral\u201d feature of \u201cdisparate treatment\u201d is \u201cdis-\ncriminatory intent.\u201d  Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rub-\nber Co., 550 U.S. 618, 624 (2007), abrogated on other \n\n15 \n \ngrounds by the Fair Pay Act \u00a7 3, 123 Stat. 5-6 (42 U.S.C. \n2000e-5(e)(3)(A)).  As relevant here, an employer acts \nwith discriminatory intent if it adopts and maintains a \npolicy that facially discriminates based on disability.  Id. \nat 634. \nSecond, the alleged discrimination must consist of \ndisparate treatment \u201cin regard to job application proce-\ndures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employ-\nees, employee compensation, job training, [or] other \nterms, conditions, and privileges of employment.\u201d  42 \nU.S.C. 12112(a).  As this Court has explained in inter-\npreting the parallel text of Title VII, that broad language \n\u201cevinces a congressional intent to strike at the entire \nspectrum of disparate treatment  * * *  in employment.\u201d  \nNational R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, \n116 (2002) (citation and internal quotation marks omit-\nted); see 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(a)(1). \nThird, the alleged discrimination must be discrimina-\ntion \u201cagainst a qualified individual.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 12112(a).  \n\u201cThe term \u2018qualified individual\u2019 means an individual who, \nwith or without reasonable accommodation, can per-\nform the essential functions of the employment position \nthat such individual holds or desires.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 12111(8).  \nThat limitation on the scope of Section 12112(a) ensures \nthat employers can require that all applicants and em-\nployees, including those with disabilities, are able to \n\u201cperform the essential functions\u201d of the job in question.  \nIbid. \n3. Former employees must file a timely charge of \nunlawful discrimination \nA final set of provisions governs when a charge of \nunlawful discrimination must be filed.  In general, a per-\nson alleging unlawful discrimination must file a charge \nwith the EEOC within 180 days (or 300 days, if the per-\n\n16 \n \nson has initially instituted proceedings with a relevant \nstate or local agency) \u201cafter the alleged unlawful em-\nployment practice occurred.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 2000e-5(e)(1); \nsee pp. 3-4, supra.  In cases involving \u201cdiscrimination in \ncompensation,\u201d including benefits, the Fair Pay Act \nspecifies when \u201can unlawful employment practice oc-\ncurs.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 2000e-5(e)(3)(A).  Under the Fair Pay \nAct, \u201can unlawful employment practice occurs, with re-\nspect to discrimination in compensation,\u201d at three points \nin time:  (1) \u201cwhen a discriminatory compensation deci-\nsion or other practice is adopted\u201d; (2) \u201cwhen an individ-\nual becomes subject to a discriminatory compensation \ndecision or other practice\u201d; and (3) \u201cwhen an individual \nis affected by application of a discriminatory compensa-\ntion decision or other practice, including each time \nwages, benefits, or other compensation is paid, result-\ning in whole or in part from such a decision or other \npractice.\u201d  Ibid. (emphases added).  Thus, a former em-\nployee alleging unlawful discrimination in compensa-\ntion must file a charge within 180 or 300 days of one of \nthose occurrences. \nB. Stanley Has Alleged Discrimination \u201cAgainst A Qualified \nIndividual\u201d Because She Held A Job And Performed  \nIts Essential Functions When The City Adopted And \nMaintained Its Allegedly Discriminatory Policy \nIn this case, Stanley alleges that the City discrimi-\nnated against her on the basis of disability in regard to \na \u201cfringe benefit\u201d\u2014namely, a post-employment health-\ninsurance subsidy.  Compl. \u00b6 23.  This case comes to the \nCourt on the assumption that Stanley is a \u201cperson\u201d en-\ntitled to sue under 42 U.S.C. 12117 and that she has ad-\nequately alleged that the City\u2019s policy facially discrimi-\nnates \u201con the basis of disability\u201d with respect to \u201ccom-\npensation\u201d or other \u201cterms, conditions, and privileges of \n\n17 \n \nemployment,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 12112(a).  The only question is \nwhether the alleged discrimination was \u201cagainst a qual-\nified individual.\u201d  Ibid.  The court of appeals rejected \nStanley\u2019s claim on the ground that Section 12112(a) for-\nbids discrimination only against a person who holds or \ndesires a job (and is capable of performing its essential \nfunctions) \u201cat the time of the alleged discrimination.\u201d  \nPet. App. 16a.  But even if that premise were correct, \nStanley did hold a job (and was capable of performing \nits essential functions) when the City adopted the chal-\nlenged policy in 2003 and maintained it as part of her \nterms and conditions of employment thereafter.  And un-\nder the Fair Pay Act, Stanley could challenge that al-\nlegedly discriminatory policy when she was later sub-\nject to or affected by it. \n1. As an initial matter, Stanley is a \u201cperson alleging \ndiscrimination on the basis of disability in violation of\u200a\u201d \nTitle I who may enforce that title against the City.  42 \nU.S.C. 12117(a); see 42 U.S.C. 2000e-5(b) and (f\u200a)(1);  \npp. 12-13, supra.  The courts below did not suggest oth-\nerwise.2 \n2. This case comes to this Court on the assumption \nthat Stanley has adequately alleged the first two ele-\n \n2 The court of appeals stated that the Sixth and Ninth Circuits \nhave held that a former employee cannot enforce Title I because \u201ca \nTitle I plaintiff must be a qualified individual, not only at the time of \ndiscrimination, but also when the plaintiff files suit.\u201d  Pet. App. 17a.  \nTo the extent that the Sixth and Ninth Circuits have adopted such \na rule, it contradicts Title I\u2019s plain text.  The term \u201cqualified indi-\nvidual\u201d appears in the Act\u2019s substantive prohibition on discrimina-\ntion, not the separate provision governing enforcement.  That sepa-\nrate provision does not require a plaintiff to be a qualified individual \nwhen a suit is filed; to the contrary, it explicitly provides that \u201cany \nperson alleging discrimination on the basis of disability\u201d may invoke \nthe remedies available under Title VII.  42 U.S.C. 12117(a). \n\n18 \n \nments of discrimination in violation of Section 12112(a)\u2014\nthat is, that the City\u2019s policy facially discriminates \u201con \nthe basis of disability\u201d and that the alleged discrimina-\ntion involved \u201ccompensation\u201d or \u201cother terms, conditions, \nand privileges of employment.\u201d  The only issue before the \nCourt is whether Stanley has adequately alleged the \nthird element:  discrimination \u201cagainst a qualified indi-\nvidual.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 12112(a).  And even on the court of \nappeals\u2019 understanding of that element, it is satisfied \nhere. \na. With respect to the first element, Stanley alleges \nthat the City\u2019s policy is \u201cdiscriminatory on its face\u201d be-\ncause it draws a \u201cdisability-based distinction\u201d between \n\u201cdisabled\u201d retirees and other retirees and treats \u201cdisa-\nbled\u201d retirees worse by \u201ctaking away the City\u2019s Health \nInsurance Subsidy before age 65.\u201d  Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 30, 37.  Be-\ncause the lower courts did not consider whether Stanley \nhad adequately alleged that the City\u2019s policy is facially \ndiscriminatory under Section 12112(a), see Pet. App. 4a-\n18a, 23a-26a, this Court should resolve the question pre-\nsented on the assumption that it is.3  And an employer \n \n3 The United States takes no position on whether Stanley has  \nadequately alleged that the City\u2019s policy facially \u201cdiscriminate[s]  \n* * *  on the basis of disability.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 12112(a); see U.S. C.A. \nAmicus Br. 3 n.2.  If this Court resolves the question presented in \nStanley\u2019s favor, it should follow its usual practice and remand for \nfurther proceedings to consider the City\u2019s contention (Br. in Opp.  \n9-17) that Stanley has not adequately alleged that the policy is fa-\ncially discriminatory\u2014a question that the courts below have not ad-\ndressed.  See, e.g., Chiaverini v. City of Napoleon, 144 S. Ct. 1745, \n1751-1752 (2024) (remanding for further proceedings to address an \n\u201celement\u201d of the petitioner\u2019s claim that was \u201cno part of the question \n[this Court] agreed to review\u201d); see also J.A. 45 (concluding that the \nCity had \u201cdemarcated neutral lines,\u201d but only in the context of grant-\ning summary judgment on Stanley\u2019s equal-protection claim). \n\n19 \n \nacts with discriminatory intent\u2014and thus engages in \nprohibited disparate treatment\u2014when it \u201cadopts and \nintentionally retains\u201d a facially discriminatory policy.  \nLedbetter, 550 U.S. at 634. \nb. With respect to the second element, there is no dis-\npute that the discrimination Stanley alleges is \u201cin regard \nto  * * *  employee compensation  * * *  and other terms, \nconditions, and privileges of employment.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n12112(a).  \u201cIn today\u2019s world the typical employee\u2019s com-\npensation is not just her take-home pay; it often in-\ncludes fringe benefits such as vacation pay and health \ninsurance.\u201d  District of Columbia v. Greater Wash. Bd. of \nTrade, 506 U.S. 125, 133 (1992) (Stevens, J., dissenting).  \nAccordingly, this Court has recognized that \u201c[h]ealth \ninsurance and other fringe benefits are \u2018compensation, \nterms, conditions, or privileges of employment.\u2019\u200a\u201d  New-\nport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co. v. EEOC, 462 \nU.S. 669, 682 (1983) (quoting 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(a)).  In-\ndeed, Section 12112 specifically references \u201cfringe ben-\nefits\u201d in one of its enumerated examples of unlawful dis-\ncrimination, making clear that it prohibits discrimina-\ntion in regard to such benefits.  42 U.S.C. 12112(b)(2); \nsee 42 U.S.C. 12101(a)(5) (finding that \u201cindividuals with \ndisabilities continually encounter various forms of dis-\ncrimination, including  * * *  relegation to lesser  * * *  \nbenefits\u201d).  The court of appeals thus correctly recog-\nnized that \u201cfringe benefits\u201d have \u201calways been recog-\nnized as one example of a term, condition, or privilege \nof employment.\u201d  Pet. App. 5a. \nStanley alleges discrimination in regard to a health-\ninsurance subsidy the City provides to employees after \nthey retire.  Compl. \u00b6 19.  The fact that the subsidy is \npaid after an employee has retired does not make it any \nless a part of \u201cemployee compensation\u201d or the \u201cterms, \n\n20 \n \nconditions, and privileges of employment.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n12112(a).  As this Court has recognized, \u201c[a] benefit need \nnot accrue before a person\u2019s employment is completed \nto be a term, condition, or privilege of that employment \nrelationship.\u201d  Hishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U.S. 69, \n77 (1984).  Like pensions and other post-employment ben-\nefits, the subsidies at issue here \u201cqualify as terms, con-\nditions, or privileges of employment even though they \nare received only after employment terminates.\u201d  Ibid. \nc. The only issue before this Court is whether Stan-\nley has adequately alleged the third element of unlawful \ndiscrimination under Title I\u2014discrimination \u201cagainst  \na qualified individual.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 12112(a).  Here, the  \nanswer to that question is straightforward:  The City \nadopted the allegedly discriminatory benefits policy in \n2003 and maintained it for the rest of Stanley\u2019s employ-\nment.  Compl. \u00b6 20.  There is no dispute that Stanley was \na qualified individual throughout that time, capable of \n\u201cperform[ing] the essential functions of the employment \nposition that [she] h[e]ld[],\u201d 42 U.S.C. 12111(8), until \nher disability ultimately forced her to retire in 2018, see \nCompl. \u00b6\u00b6 4(b), 13-16.  If Stanley is correct that the City\u2019s \n2003 policy facially discriminates based on disability, \nthen the City discriminated \u201cagainst a qualified individ-\nual,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 12112(a)\u2014namely, Stanley herself\u2014by \nadopting and maintaining a discriminatory benefits pol-\nicy as part of Stanley\u2019s terms and conditions of employ-\nment while she was working. \n3. Of course, Stanley did not file a charge with the \nEEOC until June 3, 2019, long after the City\u2019s adoption \nof the 2003 policy and after Stanley was no longer em-\nployed.  Compl. \u00b6 6.  But the Fair Pay Act makes clear \nthat Stanley\u2019s challenge is timely.  The Fair Pay Act \nspecifies that, \u201cwith respect to discrimination in com-\n\n21 \n \npensation\u201d (including \u201cbenefits\u201d), \u201can unlawful employ-\nment practice occurs\u201d not only when the allegedly dis-\ncriminatory policy is \u201cadopted,\u201d but also each time an \nindividual becomes \u201csubject to\u201d or is \u201caffected by\u201d the \npolicy.  42 U.S.C. 2000e-5(e)(3)(A).  Here, Stanley was \nsubject to or affected by the allegedly discriminatory \npolicy when the City \u201cplaced\u201d her on \u201cdisability retire-\nment\u201d on November 1, 2018, Compl. \u00b6 16; that place-\nment meant that she would receive the health-insurance \nsubsidy for only 24 months, Compl. \u00b6 26.  And because \nStanley filed her charge within 300 days after Novem-\nber 1, 2018, see Compl. \u00b6 6, her charge was timely. \nC. The Court Of Appeals Erred In Holding That Stanley \nCannot Base Her Claim On Allegedly Discriminatory \nActs That Occurred While She Was Employed \nThe court of appeals did not question Stanley\u2019s alle-\ngation that the City\u2019s 2003 benefits policy facially dis-\ncriminates on the basis of disability.  Compl. \u00b6 30.  The \ncourt also acknowledged that Stanley was \u201cemployed by \nthe City in October 2003,\u201d when the City adopted the \npolicy.  Pet. App. 16a.  The court nevertheless concluded \nthat Stanley\u2019s \u201cclaim cannot turn on\u201d the 2003 adoption \nof the policy \u201cbecause she was not yet disabled at that \ntime.\u201d  Ibid.  That was error.  It is true that Stanley did \nnot have a disability in 2003; she was not diagnosed with \nParkinson\u2019s disease until 2016.  Pet. App. 2a.  But Title I \ndoes not require the victim of discrimination on the ba-\nsis of disability to have a disability at the time of the \nallegedly discriminatory act; indeed, the court of ap-\npeals\u2019 contrary holding cannot be squared with the stat-\nutory text, which Congress amended in 2008 to elimi-\nnate any doubt on that question.  In any event, even if \nTitle I did require the victim to have a disability at the \ntime of the alleged disability-based discrimination, Stan-\n\n22 \n \nley satisfied that requirement here because she had a \ndisability between her 2016 diagnosis and her 2018 re-\ntirement.  Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 16, 26. \n1. Title I does not require the victim of disability-based \ndiscrimination to have a disability at the time of the \nalleged discrimination \nAs explained above, there are three elements to an \nunlawful discrimination claim under Title I:  (1) that the \n\u201cdiscriminat[ion]\u201d be \u201con the basis of disability\u201d; (2) that \nthe discrimination be \u201cin regard to\u201d specified practices; \nand (3) that the discrimination be \u201cagainst a qualified \nindividual.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 12112(a).  The court of appeals \ninterpreted the statute to impose a fourth element:  that \nthe individual be \u201cdisabled at th[e] time\u201d of the alleged \ndiscrimination.  Pet. App. 16a.  That interpretation can-\nnot be squared with the statutory text. \na. Section 12112(a) prohibits \u201cdiscriminat[ion] against \na qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard \nto\u201d specified practices.  42 U.S.C. 12112(a).  Establish-\ning discrimination on the basis of disability against a \nqualified individual will often require, as a factual mat-\nter, showing that the individual had a disability at the \ntime of the alleged discrimination.  A plaintiff who claims \nthat an employer refused to hire her because of a disa-\nbility, for example, must show that she had a disability \nwithin the meaning of 42 U.S.C. 12102(1).  But showing \nthat the individual had a disability at the time of the al-\nleged discrimination is not, in and of itself, an element \nof a Section 12112(a) claim.  Congress clarified any am-\nbiguity on that score when it amended the ADA in 2008. \nAs originally enacted, Section 12112(a) prohibited \n\u201cdiscriminat[ion] against a qualified individual with a \ndisability because of the disability of such individual.\u201d  \nADA \u00a7 102(a), 104 Stat. 331 (emphasis added).  The orig-\n\n23 \n \ninal version of Section 12111(8) likewise defined the \nterm \u201cqualified individual with a disability\u201d as \u201can in-\ndividual with a disability who, with or without reasona-\nble accommodation, can perform the essential functions \nof the employment position that such individual holds or \ndesires.\u201d  ADA \u00a7 101(8), 104 Stat. 331 (emphases added).  \nIn 2008, however, Congress amended those provisions \nof the ADA.  In Section 12112(a), Congress struck the \nwords \u201cwith a disability because of the disability of such \nindividual\u201d and replaced them with the phrase \u201con the \nbasis of disability.\u201d  ADAAA \u00a7 5(a)(1), 122 Stat. 3557.  \nAnd in Section 12111(8), Congress struck \u201cwith a disa-\nbility\u201d after the word \u201cindividual\u201d in both the name of \nthe defined term and the definition.  ADAAA \u00a7 5(c)(1)(B), \n122 Stat. 3557. \n\u201cWhen Congress acts to amend a statute,\u201d this Court \n\u201cpresume[s]\u201d that Congress \u201cintends its amendment to \nhave real and substantial effect.\u201d  Intel Corp. Inv. Pol-\nicy Comm. v. Sulyma, 589 U.S. 178, 189 (2020) (citation \nomitted).  Congress amended Title I to strike the words \n\u201cwith a disability because of the disability of such indi-\nvidual\u201d from Section 12112(a)\u2019s prohibition on discrimi-\nnation.  ADAAA \u00a7 5(a)(1), 122 Stat. 3557.  The effect of \nthat amendment was to make clear that a Title I plain-\ntiff is not necessarily required to allege that she was an \nindividual \u201cwith a disability\u201d at the time of the alleged \ndisability-based discrimination. \nHere, Stanley\u2019s complaint alleges that the City \u201cdis-\ncriminated against a qualified individual on the basis of \ndisability,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 12112(a), by adopting and main-\ntaining a facially discriminatory benefits policy.  Even \nif a particular employee is not yet disabled, the inclusion \nof such a facially discriminatory policy in her terms and \nconditions of employment still constitutes discrimina-\n\n24 \n \ntion \u201con the basis of disability\u201d because it reduces the \nbenefits that will be available if the employee becomes \ndisabled in the future.  By requiring Stanley to further \nallege that she was \u201cdisabled at th[e] time\u201d of the al-\nleged discrimination, Pet. App. 16a, the court of appeals \nimproperly read back into the statute the very words \nCongress removed. \nReading those words \u201cback into the current version\u201d \nof Section 12112(a) would be \u201cparticularly\u201d misguided \nbecause \u201cCongress chose to retain similar language\u201d in \nother provisions of Title I.  Wilkinson v. Garland, 601 \nU.S. 209, 224 (2024); see, e.g., 42 U.S.C. 12112(b)(1) \n(\u201cbecause of the disability of such applicant or em-\nployee\u201d); 42 U.S.C. 12112(b)(2) (\u201cqualified applicant or \nemployee with a disability\u201d); 42 U.S.C. 12112(b)(5) \n(\u201cotherwise qualified individual with a disability\u201d); 42 \nU.S.C. 12112(b)(6) (\u201cindividual with a disability\u201d).4 \nb. The court of appeals\u2019 interpretation also cannot be \nsquared with Section 12112(b)(4).  Entitled \u201cConstruc-\ntion,\u201d Section 12112(b) instructs that \u201cthe term \u2018dis-\ncriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of \ndisability\u2019 includes\u201d various specific practices.  And un-\nder Section 12112(b)(4), one of those prohibited prac-\ntices is discrimination against \u201ca qualified individual be-\ncause of the known disability of an individual with whom \n \n4 The ADAAA\u2019s amendments became \u201ceffective on January 1, 2009,\u201d \n\u00a7 8, 122 Stat. 3559, and thus apply to claims that \u201carose after that \ndate,\u201d Mazzeo v. Color Resolutions Int\u2019l, LLC, 746 F.3d 1264, 1267 \n(11th Cir. 2014) (citation omitted).  Under the Fair Pay Act, Stanley\u2019s \nADA claim arose when she became \u201csubject to\u201d or was \u201caffected by\u201d \nthe City\u2019s allegedly discriminatory benefits policy.  42 U.S.C. 2000e-\n5(e)(3)(A).  Because that occurred after January 1, 2009, the ADAAA\u2019s \namendments apply to Stanley\u2019s claim\u2014as both the City and the \nlower courts have recognized, see, e.g., Br. in Opp. 3-4, 32; Resp. \nC.A. Br. 10; Pet. App. 13a-14a, 21a, 24a. \n\n25 \n \nthe qualified individual is known to have a relationship \nor association.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 12112(b)(4).  Accordingly, even \nif a \u201cqualified individual\u201d herself does not have a disa-\nbility, she may still be the victim of discrimination \u201c\u200a\u2018on \nthe basis of disability\u2019\u200a\u201d if the employer discriminates \nagainst her \u201cbecause of the known disability\u201d of some-\none else.  Ibid.  The court of appeals\u2019 interpretation\u2014\nwhich would require that a qualified individual herself \nhave a disability at the time of the alleged discrimina-\ntion, including when an allegedly facially discriminatory \npolicy was adopted\u2014contradicts Congress\u2019s own \u201c[c]on-\nstruction\u201d of Section 12112(a).  Ibid.; see ADA \u00a7 102(b), \n104 Stat. 332. \nc. Although Stanley need not allege that she was an \nindividual \u201cwith a disability\u201d at the time of the City\u2019s \nadoption of the allegedly facially discriminatory policy \nin order to state a Section 12112(a) claim, that does not \nmean that her disability status is irrelevant, or that in-\ndividuals without disabilities can routinely sue to en-\nforce Section 12112(a).  Stanley has Article III standing \nto challenge the City\u2019s policy only because she subse-\nquently became an individual with a disability who was \ninjured by the policy.  Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 16, 26.5  Likewise, the \n \n5 Indeed, Stanley acknowledged below that \u201cshe would have lacked \nstanding\u201d if she had brought her Title I claim as \u201ca non-disabled \nemployee\u201d in 2003.  Pet. C.A. Br. 22 & n.5.  The court of appeals \nmistook that statement about standing as a concession on the merits \nof her Title I claim, stating that she \u201cconcede[d]\u201d that \u201cher claim \ncannot turn\u201d on the 2003 adoption of the allegedly discriminatory \npolicy \u201cbecause she was not yet disabled at that time.\u201d  Pet. App. 16a.  \nBut as Stanley explains (Pet. Br. 24-25), she made no such conces-\nsion.  On the merits of her Title I claim, she has consistently main-\ntained that the City\u2019s adoption of the policy \u201cviolate[d]\u201d the ADA, \neven though she did not have a disability at the time.  Compl. \u00b6 37; \nsee, e.g., Pet. C.A. Br. 22 n.5 (describing the 2003 adoption of the \n\n26 \n \ncharge that Stanley filed with the EEOC was timely \nonly because, after being diagnosed with a disability, she \nwas subject to or affected by the policy.  See pp. 20-21, \nsupra.  Thus, to say that an individual need not have a \ndisability at the time of the alleged discrimination is to \nsay only that such a temporal connection is not an ele-\nment of the underlying Section 12112(a) claim.  The court \nof appeals erred in rejecting Stanley\u2019s claim on the \nground that it did not satisfy that nonexistent element.  \nPet. App. 16a. \n2. Even if Title I required the victim of disability-based \ndiscrimination to have a disability at the time of the \nalleged discrimination, that requirement was satisfied \nhere \nEven if the court of appeals were correct that the vic-\ntim of disability-based discrimination under Section \n12112(a) must be \u201cdisabled at th[e] time\u201d of the alleged \ndiscrimination, Pet. App. 16a, that requirement was sat-\nisfied here.  This case comes to the Court on the assump-\ntion that Stanley has adequately alleged that the City \nacted with discriminatory intent not only in adopting \nthe allegedly discriminatory benefits policy in 2003, but \nalso in maintaining that policy throughout the rest of \nher employment\u2014including the period after she was di-\nagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease in 2016, during which \nit eventually became apparent that Stanley would be \nforced to take disability retirement.  See Compl. \u00b6 16; \nPet. App. 2a; pp. 18-19, supra.  It is undisputed that dur-\ning that period, Stanley was an individual with a disabil-\n \npolicy as the \u201coriginal discriminatory decision\u201d); Pet. C.A. Reply Br. \n6 (\u201c[T]he City\u2019s decision to enact the facially discriminatory 24-\nMonth Rule in 2003 is the initial \u2018challenged employment deci-\nsion.\u2019\u200a\u201d) (emphasis omitted). \n\n27 \n \nity.  Compl. \u00b6 16.  And it is likewise clear that, for at least \npart of that period, Stanley was a \u201cqualified individual\u201d \nbecause she could still perform the essential functions \nof her job.  See ibid.  Accordingly, Stanley\u2019s complaint \nadequately alleges that she \u201cwas a disabled employee  \n* * *  capable of performing the job at the time of the \nalleged discrimination.\u201d  Pet. App. 16a. \nThe court of appeals did not suggest otherwise.  To \nthe contrary, it acknowledged the possibility that \u201ca \ncompleted claim of disability discrimination may have \naccrued while Stanley was a qualified individual per-\nforming her duties as a firefighter\u201d because she \u201csuf-\nfered discrimination as a disabled employee\u201d during the \nperiod \u201cbefore she retired but af\u200ater she was diagnosed \nwith Parkinson\u2019s.\u201d  Pet. App. 17a.  And the court acknowl-\nedged that the United States had made precisely that \nargument.  Id. at 18a; see U.S. C.A. Amicus Br. 11-12.  \nBut the court declined to consider that argument be-\ncause it believed that Stanley herself had \u201cspecifically \ndisclaimed\u201d it.  Pet. App. 18a. \nThat is incorrect.  Although such an argument ap-\npeared for the \u201cfirst time\u201d in the United States\u2019 amicus \nbrief in the court of appeals, Pet. App. 18a, the court \noverlooked the fact that the United States filed that \nbrief before Stanley filed her opening brief, which ex-\npressly adopted the United States\u2019 arguments, Pet. \nC.A. Br. viii-ix, 10, 20; see Pet. C.A. Reply Br. 4 (\u201cThe \nCity inserted [its] facially discriminatory policy \u2018on the \nbasis of disability\u2019 into the terms and conditions of Ms. \nStanley\u2019s employment in 2003 and kept it there every \nday throughout her employment while she was a Quali-\nfied Individual.\u201d).  And although Stanley stated in her \nopening brief that she was not \u201cimpacted by the discrim-\ninatory 24-month rule during her employment,\u201d Pet. \n\n28 \n \nC.A. Br. 22, that statement simply reflects that she was \nnot \u201cplaced on disability retirement\u201d until she retired, \nCompl. \u00b6 16.  As explained above, that fact does not un-\ndermine the validity of her Title I claim.  See pp. 20-21, \n25-27, supra.6 \nD. The Court Of Appeals Erred In Holding That A Title I \nPlaintiff Must Hold Or Desire A Job At The Time Of The \nAlleged Discrimination \nBecause Stanley held a job and was performing its \nessential functions when the City adopted and main-\ntained its allegedly discriminatory policy, this Court can \nresolve this case without deciding whether the court of \nappeals was correct to hold that \u201ca Title I plaintiff must \n\u2018hold[] or desire[]\u2019 an employment position with the de-\nfendant at the time of the defendant\u2019s allegedly wrong-\nful act.\u201d  Pet. App. 2a (quoting 42 U.S.C. 12111(8)) (brack-\nets in original).  That question will have practical signif-\nicance only in cases where, unlike here, \u201cthe alleged dis-\ncrimination occurred entirely after the employment re-\n \n6 The court of appeals also faulted Stanley for failing to raise this \nargument in the district court.  Pet. App. 17a-18a.  But the City raised \nthat asserted forfeiture in opposing certiorari, see Br. in Opp. 30-31, \nand this Court presumably \u201cconsidered and rejected that contention\u201d \nin nonetheless granting review, United States v. Williams, 504 U.S. \n36, 40 (1992).  That is for good reason.  \u201cOnce a federal claim is properly \npresented, a party can make any argument in support of that claim.\u201d  \nYee v. Escondido, 503 U.S. 519, 534 (1992).  The contention that Stan-\nley \u201csuffered discrimination as a disabled employee\u201d during the pe-\nriod \u201cbefore she retired but af\u200ater she was diagnosed with Parkin-\nson\u2019s,\u201d Pet. App. 17a, is \u201cnot a new claim,\u201d but a \u201cnew argument\u201d in \nsupport of her \u201cconsistent claim\u201d that her status as a former em-\nployee does not preclude her from challenging the City\u2019s allegedly \ndiscriminatory benefits policy under Title I, Lebron v. National \nR.R. Passenger Corp., 513 U.S. 374, 379 (1995); see Pet. C.A. Reply \nBr. 12-13. \n\n29 \n \nlationship had already terminated.\u201d  Id. at 17a.  But if the \nCourt reaches the issue, it should hold that Title I pro-\nhibits discrimination in post-employment benefits even \nif the discrimination occurs only after the victim is  \nno longer employed.  Otherwise, Title I\u2019s comprehen-\nsive prohibition on disability discrimination in employ-\nment would fail to cover a key aspect of the employment  \nrelationship\u2014and employers would have free rein to en-\ngage in even the most blatant discrimination against re-\ntirees with disabilities.  The court of appeals reached a \ndifferent conclusion only because it misread the defini-\ntion of \u201cqualified individual\u201d to impose a temporal limit \non the scope of Title I\u2019s prohibition on discrimination, \nwhich instead reaches any discrimination in a qualified \nindividual\u2019s \u201cemployee compensation\u201d or other \u201cterms, \nconditions, and privileges of employment\u201d\u2014including \ndeferred compensation paid after the employment rela-\ntionship ends.  42 U.S.C. 12112(a). \n1. Title I prohibits discrimination in \u201cemployee com-\npensation.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 12112(a) (emphasis added).  By \ndefinition, the covered compensation is payment for \nwork as a qualified individual\u2014that is, for \u201cperform[ing] \nthe essential functions of the employment position that \n[an] individual holds,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 12111(8).  Although \u201cre-\ntirement pay\u201d and other post-employment benefits are \n\u201cnot actually disbursed during the time an individual is \nworking,\u201d they are \u201cdeferred compensation for past \nyears of service.\u201d  Davis v. Michigan Dep\u2019t of the Treas., \n489 U.S. 803, 808 (1989).  Similarly, Title I\u2019s prohibition \non discrimination in other \u201cterms, conditions, and priv-\nileges of employment,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 12112(a) (emphasis \nadded), reaches only terms, conditions, and privileges \nthat are \u201cpart and parcel of the employment relationship\u201d \n\u2014and that remains true even if a particular benefit is \n\n30 \n \n\u201creceived only after employment terminates,\u201d Hishon, \n467 U.S. at 75, 77.   \nAccordingly, when an employer makes a discrimina-\ntory change in a plaintiff\u200a\u2019s post-employment compensa-\ntion or other benefits, it is retroactively altering the \nplaintiff\u200a\u2019s terms or conditions of employment and chang-\ning the compensation she earned as an employee per-\nforming the essential functions of her job\u2014i.e., as a qual-\nified individual.  And because such a retroactive change \nconstitutes discrimination in the terms and conditions \nof the plaintiff\u200a\u2019s employment as a qualified individual, it \nis naturally described as discrimination \u201cagainst a qual-\nified individual,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 12112(a), even if the plaintiff \nis no longer employed. \nThis Court reached a similar conclusion in Davis.  \nThere, a statute consented to state taxation of \u201cpay or \ncompensation for personal services as an officer or em-\nployee of the United States,\u201d provided that the taxation \ndid not \u201cdiscriminate against the officer or employee be-\ncause of the source of the pay or compensation.\u201d  Davis, \n489 U.S. at 808 (citation omitted).  The Court \u201cha[d] no \ndifficulty concluding\u201d that federal retirement benefits \nqualify as compensation for service as a federal em-\nployee.  Ibid.  And the Court rejected the argument that \nthe prohibition on discrimination against an \u201c\u200a\u2018employee\u2019\u200a\u201d \napplied \u201conly to current employees.\u201d  Ibid. (emphasis \nadded; citation omitted).  The Court explained that be-\ncause the provision covered any compensation earned \nas an employee, discrimination against a retiree consti-\ntuted discrimination against an \u201cemployee\u201d within the \nmeaning of the statute even though the retiree had \nceased to be an employee by the time the discrimination \noccurred.  Id. at 809.  The same logic applies here. \n\n31 \n \nThe court of appeals emphasized that Title I\u2019s defi-\nnition of \u201cqualified individual\u201d uses present-tense verbs, \nreferring to someone who \u201ccan perform the essential \nfunctions of the employment position that such individ-\nual holds or desires.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 12111(8); see Pet. App. \n11a.  That use of the present tense makes clear that a \nperson\u2019s status as a qualified individual depends on her \npresent abilities; someone who ceases to be able to per-\nform the essential functions of her job ceases to be a \nqualified individual and thus is not protected from ter-\nmination or entitled to a reasonable accommodation.  \nBut that does not mean that Title I permits discrimina-\ntion in the distribution of compensation or other bene-\nfits that a plaintiff earned while she was a qualified in-\ndividual. \nImagine, for example, a statute prohibiting airlines \nfrom discriminating against a \u201cqualified passenger\u201d in \nthe \u201cterms, conditions, or privileges of carriage\u201d and de-\nfining a \u201cqualified passenger\u201d to mean someone who \n\u201cmeets the carrier\u2019s eligibility requirements for the flight \non which the passenger is flying or seeks to fly.\u201d  If an \nairline discriminated against a plaintiff in the handling \nof her baggage at her destination, it could not escape \nliability on the theory that the flight had landed\u2014and \nthus the plaintiff was no longer a \u201cqualified passenger\u201d\u2014\nwhen the discrimination occurred.  So too here:  Discrim-\nination in the compensation or other terms, conditions, \nor privileges a plaintiff earned as a qualified individual \nis \u201cdiscriminat[ion] against a qualified individual\u201d within \nthe meaning of Title I\u2014even if that discrimination oc-\ncurs only after the individual is no longer employed.  42 \nU.S.C. 12112(a). \n2. Stanley offers (Pet. Br. 27-47) a different textual \npathway to essentially the same result.  She argues that \n\n32 \n \nSection 12111(8)\u2019s definition of \u201cqualified individual\u201d is \n\u201cbest read to impose only a conditional mandate\u201d:  \u201cIf a \nperson has (or seeks) a job, that person must be able to \nperform its essential functions; if no such job exists\u2014\nbecause the person is retired\u2014the definition does not \noperate as a limit on the ADA\u2019s prohibition on discrimi-\nnation.\u201d  Id. at 28.  On Stanley\u2019s view, therefore, she con-\ntinued to be a qualified individual even after she retired \nbecause the requirement that she be able to perform the \nessential functions of her job simply ceased to apply.   \nWe have offered a somewhat different understanding \nof the statute, under which a retiree is no longer a qual-\nified individual but remains protected from discrimina-\ntion in the distribution of benefits that she earned as a \nqualified individual.  In our view, that is the most natu-\nral reading of the statutory text, and the powerful con-\ntextual arguments that Stanley advances (Pet. Br. 45-\n47) generally support our reading as well.  But we agree \nthat Stanley\u2019s alternative approach is also a textually \npermissible interpretation of Section 12111(8)\u2019s defini-\ntion of qualified individual.  Indeed, as Stanley explains \n(id. at 34-42), similarly phrased directions are often un-\nderstood to impose only conditional requirements.  And \nwe agree with Stanley (id. at 45-47) that statutory con-\ntext, structure, and purpose all strongly indicate that \nTitle I prohibits discrimination in all of the terms, con-\nditions, or privileges of employment, including post- \nemployment benefits.  The Court should not adopt an in-\nterpretation of the statute that would exclude that im-\nportant aspect of the employment relationship\u2014which, \nas this case illustrates, can be especially important for \nindividuals with disabilities. \n\n33 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be vacated \nand the case remanded for further proceedings. \nRespectfully submitted. \nKARLA GILBRIDE \nGeneral Counsel \nJENNIFER S.

others who have a rec-\nord of a disability or are regarded as having a disa-\nbility also have been subjected to discrimination; \n \n(2) historically, society has tended to isolate and \nsegregate individuals with disabilities, and, despite \nsome improvements, such forms of discrimination \nagainst individuals with disabilities continue to be a \nserious and pervasive social problem; \n \n(3) discrimination against individuals with disa-\nbilities persists in such critical areas as employment, \nhousing, public accommodations, education, trans-\nportation, communication, recreation, institutionali-\nzation, health services, voting, and access to public \nservices; \n \n(4) unlike individuals who have experienced dis-\ncrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, national \norigin, religion, or age, individuals who have experi-\nenced discrimination on the basis of disability have \noften had no legal recourse to redress such discrimi-\nnation; \n\n2a \n \n \n(5) individuals with disabilities continually en-\ncounter various forms of discrimination, including \noutright intentional exclusion, the discriminatory ef-\nfects of architectural, transportation, and communi-\ncation barriers, overprotective rules and policies, \nfailure to make modifications to existing facilities and \npractices, exclusionary qualification standards and \ncriteria, segregation, and relegation to lesser ser-\nvices, programs, activities, benefits, jobs, or other op-\nportunities; \n \n(6) census data, national polls, and other studies \nhave documented that people with disabilities, as a \ngroup, occupy an inferior status in our society, and \nare severely disadvantaged socially, vocationally, \neconomically, and educationally; \n \n(7) the Nation\u2019s proper goals regarding individ-\nuals with disabilities are to assure equality of oppor-\ntunity, full participation, independent living, and eco-\nnomic self-sufficiency for such individuals; and \n \n(8) the continuing existence of unfair and unnec-\nessary discrimination and prejudice denies people \nwith disabilities the opportunity to compete on an \nequal basis and to pursue those opportunities for \nwhich our free society is justifiably famous, and costs \nthe United States billions of dollars in unnecessary \nexpenses resulting from dependency and nonproduc-\ntivity. \n(b) \nPurpose \nIt is the purpose of this chapter\u2014 \n \n(1) to provide a clear and comprehensive na-\ntional mandate for the elimination of discrimination \nagainst individuals with disabilities; \n\n3a \n \n \n(2) to provide clear, strong, consistent, enforce-\nable standards addressing discrimination against in-\ndividuals with disabilities; \n \n(3) to ensure that the Federal Government plays \na central role in enforcing the standards established \nin this chapter on behalf of individuals with disabili-\nties;

Such an action may be \nbrought in any judicial district in the State in which the \nunlawful employment practice is alleged to have been \ncommitted, in the judicial district in which the employ-\n\n25a \n \nment records relevant to such practice are maintained \nand administered, or in the judicial district in which the \naggrieved person would have worked but for the alleged \nunlawful employment practice, but if the respondent is \nnot found within any such district, such an action may \nbe brought within the judicial district in which the re-\nspondent has his principal office.  For purposes of sec-\ntions 1404 and 1406 of title 28, the judicial district in \nwhich the respondent has his principal office shall in all \ncases be considered a district in which the action might \nhave been brought. \n(4) It shall be the duty of the chief judge of the dis-\ntrict (or in his absence, the acting chief judge) in which \nthe case is pending immediately to designate a judge in \nsuch district to hear and determine the case.  In the \nevent that no judge in the district is available to hear \nand determine the case, the chief judge of the district, \nor the acting chief judge, as the case may be, shall cer-\ntify this fact to the chief judge of the circuit (or in his \nabsence, the acting chief judge) who shall then designate \na district or circuit judge of the circuit to hear and de-\ntermine the case. \n(5) It shall be the duty of the judge designated pur-\nsuant to this subsection to assign the case for hearing at \nthe earliest practicable date and to cause the case to be \nin every way expedited.  If such judge has not sched-\nuled the case for trial within one hundred and twenty \ndays after issue has been joined, that judge may appoint \na master pursuant to rule 53 of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure. \n\n26a \n \n(g) \nInjunctions; appropriate affirmative action; equita-\nble relief; accrual of back pay; reduction of back pay; \nlimitations on judicial orders \n(1) If the court finds that the respondent has inten-\ntionally engaged in or is intentionally engaging in an un-\nlawful employment practice charged in the complaint, \nthe court may enjoin the respondent from engaging in \nsuch unlawful employment practice, and order such af-\nfirmative action as may be appropriate, which may in-\nclude, but is not limited to, reinstatement or hiring of \nemployees, with or without back pay (payable by the em-\nployer, employment agency, or labor organization, as \nthe case may be, responsible for the unlawful employ-\nment practice), or any other equitable relief as the court \ndeems appropriate.  Back pay liability shall not accrue \nfrom a date more than two years prior to the filing of a \ncharge with the Commission.  Interim earnings or \namounts earnable with reasonable diligence by the per-\nson or persons discriminated against shall operate to re-\nduce the back pay otherwise allowable. \n(2)(A)  No order of the court shall require the ad-\nmission or reinstatement of an individual as a member \nof a union, or the hiring, reinstatement, or promotion of \nan individual as an employee, or the payment to him of \nany back pay, if such individual was refused admission, \nsuspended, or expelled, or was refused employment or \nadvancement or was suspended or discharged for any \nreason other than discrimination on account of race, \ncolor, religion, sex, or national origin or in violation of \nsection 2000e-3(a) of this title. \n(B) On a claim in which an individual proves a viola-\ntion under section 2000e-2(m) of this title and a respond-\nent demonstrates that the respondent would have taken \n\n27a \n \nthe same action in the absence of the impermissible mo-\ntivating factor, the court\u2014 \n \n(i) \nmay grant declaratory relief, injunctive relief \n(except as provided in clause (ii)), and attorney\u2019s fees \nand costs demonstrated to be directly attributable \nonly to the pursuit of a claim under section 2000e-\n2(m) of this title; and \n \n(ii) shall not award damages or issue an order re-\nquiring any admission, reinstatement, hiring, promo-\ntion, or payment, described in subparagraph (A). \n(h) Provisions of chapter 6 of title 29 not applicable to \ncivil actions for prevention of unlawful practices \nThe provisions of chapter 6 of title 29 shall not apply \nwith respect to civil actions brought under this section. \n(i) \nProceedings by Commission to compel compliance \nwith judicial orders \nIn any case in which an employer, employment \nagency, or labor organization fails to comply with an or-\nder of a court issued in a civil action brought under this \nsection, the Commission may commence proceedings to \ncompel compliance with such order. \n(\u200aj) \nAppeals \nAny civil action brought under this section and any \nproceedings brought under subsection (i) shall be sub-\nject to appeal as provided in sections 1291 and 1292, title \n28. \n(k) Attorney\u2019s fee; liability of Commission and United \nStates for costs \nIn any action or proceeding under this subchapter \nthe court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing \n\n28a \n \nparty, other than the Commission or the United States, \na reasonable attorney\u2019s fee (including expert fees) as \npart of the costs, and the Commission and the United \nStates shall be liable for costs the same as a private per-\nson. \n \n7. \n42 U.S.C. 12111(8) (2006) provides: \nDefinitions  \n \nAs used in this subchapter: \n*  *  *  *  * \n(8) Qualified individual with a disability  \n \nThe term \u201cqualified individual with a disability\u201d \nmeans an individual with a disability who, with or \nwithout reasonable accommodation, can perform the \nessential functions of the employment position that \nsuch individual holds or desires.  For the purposes \nof this subchapter, consideration shall be given to the \nemployer\u2019s judgment as to what functions of a job are \nessential, and if an employer has prepared a written \ndescription before advertising or interviewing appli-\ncants for the job, this description shall be considered \nevidence of the essential functions of the job. \n*  *  *  *  * \n \n\n29a \n \n8. \n42 U.S.C. 12112(a) and (b) (2006) provide: \nDiscrimination  \n(a) \nGeneral rule  \nNo covered entity shall discriminate against a quali-\nfied individual with a disability because of the disability \nof such individual in regard to job application proce-\ndures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employ-\nees, employee compensation, job training, and other \nterms, conditions, and privileges of employment.   \n(b) \nConstruction  \nAs used in subsection (a) of this section, the term \n\u201cdiscriminate\u201d includes\u2014  \n \n(1) limiting, segregating, or classifying a job ap-\nplicant or employee in a way that adversely affects \nthe opportunities or status of such applicant or em-\nployee because of the disability of such applicant or \nemployee;  \n \n(2) participating in a contractual or other ar-\nrangement or relationship that has the effect of sub-\njecting a covered entity\u2019s qualified applicant or em-\nployee with a disability to the discrimination prohib-\nited by this subchapter (such relationship includes a \nrelationship with an employment or referral agency, \nlabor union, an organization providing fringe benefits \nto an employee of the covered entity, or an organiza-\ntion providing training and apprenticeship pro-\ngrams);  \n \n(3) utilizing standards, criteria, or methods of \nadministration\u2014  \n\n30a \n \n \n(A) \nthat have the effect of discrimination on \nthe basis of disability; or  \n \n(B) \nthat perpetuate the discrimination of oth-\ners who are subject to common administrative \ncontrol;  \n \n(4) excluding or otherwise denying equal jobs or \nbenefits to a qualified individual because of the \nknown disability of an individual with whom the qual-\nified individual is known to have a relationship or  \nassociation;  \n \n(5)(A)  not making reasonable accommodations \nto the known physical or mental limitations of an oth-\nerwise qualified individual with a disability who is an \napplicant or employee, unless such covered entity can \ndemonstrate that the accommodation would impose \nan undue hardship on the operation of the business of \nsuch covered entity; or  \n \n(B) denying employment opportunities to a job \napplicant or employee who is an otherwise qualified \nindividual with a disability, if such denial is based on \nthe need of such covered entity to make reasonable \naccommodation to the physical or mental impair-\nments of the employee or applicant;  \n \n(6) using qualification standards, employment \ntests or other selection criteria that screen out or \ntend to screen out an individual with a disability or a \nclass of individuals with disabilities unless the stand-\nard, test or other selection criteria, as used by the \ncovered entity, is shown to be job-related for the po-\nsition in question and is consistent with business ne-\ncessity; and  \n\n31a \n \n \n(7) failing to select and administer tests concern-\ning employment in the most effective manner to en-\nsure that, when such test is administered to a job ap-\nplicant or employee who has a disability that impairs \nsensory, manual, or speaking skills, such test results \naccurately reflect the skills, aptitude, or whatever \nother factor of such applicant or employee that such \ntest purports to measure, rather than reflecting the \nimpaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills of such \nemployee or applicant (except where such skills are \nthe factors that the test purports to measure). \n*  *  *  *  *",

The fact that the generated response is a useless placeholder reveals a critical flaw in the agent's design: it either incorrectly assessed its readiness to answer or has a fundamental failure in its final response generation module.
