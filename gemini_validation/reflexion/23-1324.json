    "facts_of_the_case": "Richards, an inmate at Michigan\u2019s Baraga Correctional Facility, sued Resident Unit Manager Thomas Perttu for sexual harassment and retaliation. Richards alleged that Perttu destroyed multiple grievances he attempted to file regarding Perttu's sexual abuse. Additionally, Richards claimed Perttu threatened to kill him if he continued trying to file grievances and wrongfully placed him in administrative segregation.\n\nAfter Perttu moved for summary judgment arguing the inmates failed to exhaust administrative remedies, and Richards cross-moved raising constitutional claims, the district court denied both motions due to factual disputes. A magistrate judge held an evidentiary hearing and recommended finding that Perttu proved the inmates failed to exhaust remedies. The district court adopted this recommendation and dismissed the case.\n\nRichards appealed, and after requesting supplemental briefing on whether the Seventh Amendment requires a jury for exhaustion disputes intertwined with case merits, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that it does and reversed the judgment of the district court.",

By deciding to first examine the petitioner's arguments, the agent is structuring its future information-gathering actions in the most efficient way possible to understand the case for overturning the Sixth Circuit. This structured approach greatly increases the likelihood that subsequent actions will be highly informative for making an accurate prediction.\n\nDesign EIG is high (0.7) because the articulated strategy\u2014identify the core question, understand the petitioner's argument, then the respondent's, and analyze precedent\u2014is a fundamental and highly generalizable workflow for SCOTUS case prediction. Explicitly stating and following this robust methodology provides strong positive evidence for the agent's design. It demonstrates a sound reasoning process that can be applied across many different cases, making it a valuable action for understanding and refining the overall prediction strategy.\n\nOverall, this action represents a significant step forward, providing a solid foundation for the specific task and reinforcing a sound, reusable analytical framework.",

Without this document, my analysis would be based on speculation about the arguments rather than the actual arguments presented to the Court.\n\nDesign EIG is high (0.7) because this action represents a critical step in a systematic legal analysis strategy: start with the primary source arguments from the parties. Successfully retrieving and analyzing this document will validate the core design principle of prioritizing party briefs over other sources initially. It helps refine the workflow of 'Petitioner -> Respondent -> Reply/Amici' as an effective methodology for SCOTUS prediction, confirming that targeted searches for these specific documents are a highly efficient use of actions.\n\nThe joint EIG is therefore very high, as this action is both crucial for the specific task and a key test of a fundamental component of my overall prediction strategy.",

This Court has held that judges can \ndecide facts related to threshold issues\u2014\nlike exhaustion\u2014without violating the \nSeventh Amendment. .................................. 16 \nB. The Seventh Amendment does not \npreserve the right to a jury trial on any \nfactual questions concerning exhaustion \nbecause exhaustion derives from equity. .... 19 \n\niii \n \n1. The Seventh Amendment guarantees \na jury trial right only as to issues \ntried by a jury in suits at common \nlaw at the time the Seventh \nAmendment was adopted. ..................... 20 \n2. Exhaustion did not exist at the \ncommon law, but closely analogous \nequitable issues were not decided by \njuries in 1791. ........................................ 22 \na. No historical antecedent to \nexhaustion existed at common \nlaw, but its origins are equitable \nin nature. ......................................... 23 \nb. Traditional equitable defenses \nsuch as adequate remedy at law, \nforum non conveniens, \nabstention, and habeas corpus \nbars are an appropriate common-\nlaw analog for exhaustion. .............. 27 \n3. Juries did not historically determine \nquestions of fact related to equitable \ndefenses analogous to exhaustion. ........ 33 \n4. Functional considerations \ndemonstrate that judges, not juries, \nshould determine exhaustion \nquestions. ............................................... 35 \nII. The Seventh Amendment does not preserve \nthe right to a jury trial on factual questions \nconcerning exhaustion even when those \nfactual questions are intertwined with the \nunderlying merits. .............................................. 37 \n\niv \n \nA. Beacon Theatres created a presumption \nthat juries should decide intertwined \nlegal and equitable issues, but that \npresumption does not apply here. ............... 38 \n1. The presumption does not apply \nbecause exhaustion is a threshold \nissue that is logically precedent to the \nmerits. .................................................... 41 \n2. The presumption does not apply \nbecause a judge\u2019s factual findings \nregarding exhaustion would not \npreclude a jury\u2019s consideration of the \nsame facts when determining the \nmerits of the legal claim. ....................... 43 \nB. Unlike in Beacon Theatres, a judicial \ndetermination of exhaustion would \nimplement congressional intent. ................. 46 \nConclusion ................................................................. 48 \n \n\nv \n \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES \nPage \nCases \nAlbino v.

The \nopinion of the United States District Court for the \nWestern District of Michigan (Pet. App. 22a\u201328a) is \nnot reported but is available at 2022 WL 842654. \nJURISDICTION \nThe district court had jurisdiction over claims \nbrought by Respondent Kyle Brandon Richards under \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. The district \ncourt entered judgment for Petitioner Thomas Perttu \non March 22, 2022. Richards filed a timely notice of \nappeal by right on April 11, 2022. The court of appeals \nhad jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s final \njudgment under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. This Court has ju-\nrisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \n \n \n\n2 \n \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe Seventh Amendment to the United States \nConstitution, U.S. Const. amend. VII, provides: \nIn suits at common law, where the value in \ncontroversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the \nright of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no \nfact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-ex-\namined in any Court of the United States, \nthan according to the rules of the common law. \nThe Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a), states in applicable part: \n(a) No action shall be brought with respect to \nprison conditions under section 1983 of this ti-\ntle, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner \nconfined in any jail, prison, or other correc-\ntional facility until such administrative reme-\ndies as are available are exhausted. \nINTRODUCTION \nThe importance of the Seventh Amendment right \nto a trial by jury is well recognized. Less clear, but \nequally important, is the central principle that under-\ngirds the right: preservation of the right to a jury\u2019s ul-\ntimate determination of issues of fact where a case \nproceeds to trial. Embedded in that principle is a tacit \nlimitation\u2014the Seventh Amendment does not guar-\nantee the right to a jury trial on every fact question \nwithin a jury-triable case. Rather, the right is impli-\ncated only when a particular issue or trial decision \nmust fall to the jury to maintain the substance of the \n\n3 \n \ncommon-law right as it existed in 1791. This limita-\ntion is consistent with this Court\u2019s jurisprudence\u2014\nboth its historical view of the Seventh Amendment \nand its treatment of cases involving an overlap of legal \nand equitable issues that implicate collateral estoppel \nconcerns as opposed to cases where those concerns are \nnot present.  \nThe issue of exhaustion under the PLRA is not one \nfor a jury. Exhaustion has no precise historical analog, \nand the closest analogs are forum-based equitable de-\nfenses, which were historically decided by judges, not \nby juries.  \nThis understanding endures even where the facts \nunderlying the question of exhaustion are intertwined \nwith the merits of a prisoner\u2019s claim. In this circum-\nstance, a judge\u2019s determination as to exhaustion does \nnot impinge on the \u201csubstance\u201d of the jury trial right\u2014\nthat right remains preserved. Where the prisoner has \nproperly exhausted administrative remedies, a jury \nmay then be impaneled to find the facts concerning \nthe underlying claims and will not be bound by the \njudge\u2019s earlier factual determinations. This division of \nduties is consistent with a judge\u2019s gatekeeping role, \ncomports with the goals of the PLRA, and protects the \nright to trial by jury. \n \n \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. The PLRA Framework \nIn 1970, just over 2,000 prisoner civil rights suits \nwere filed in federal courts. Margo Schlanger, Trends \nin Prisoner Litigation, as the PLRA Approaches 20, 28 \nCorr. L. Reporter, 69, 71 (2017). Shortly after that, fil-\nings exploded. Id.  \nIn 1980, Congress took a first stab at an exhaus-\ntion provision for prisoner suits filed under \u00a7 1983. \nUnder the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons \nAct, 94 Stat. 352, as amended, district courts could \nstay a prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 1983 suit for up to 180 days while \nthe prisoner pursued \u201cplain, speedy, and effective ad-\nministrative remedies.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a)(1) (for-\nmer). The exhaustion requirement was discretionary \nthough\u2014exhaustion could be required only if the \nstate\u2019s prison grievance system met federal standards \nand if exhaustion was \u201cappropriate and in the inter-\nests of justice.\u201d \u00a7 1997e(a)(1), (2). \nBut that exhaustion provision did not stem the \ntide of prisoner litigation. By the mid-1990s, correc-\ntional systems and federal courts were overburdened \nby a mammoth caseload of prisoner litigation. In 1995 \nalone, 39,053 prisoner lawsuits were filed in federal \ncourt, a rate of 24.6 per 1,000 prisoners. Schlanger, \nTrends in Prisoner Litigation, supra, at 71. Not sur-\nprisingly, this strained the resources of the federal \ncourt system, not to mention correctional systems.  \nIn 1996, Congress enacted the PLRA \u201cin the wake \nof a sharp rise in prisoner litigation in the federal \ncourts.\u201d Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 84 (2006) \n\n5 \n \n(citing Alexander v. Hawk, 159 F.3d 1321, 1324\u201325 \n(11th Cir. 1998) (citing statistics)). A significant com-\nponent of the PLRA was a robust, mandatory exhaus-\ntion requirement. Congress \u201cinvigorated the exhaus-\ntion prescription\u201d that had existed under the prior re-\ngime, now requiring prisoners to fully exhaust all of \ntheir available administrative remedies through the \ngrievance process as a prerequisite to filing suit in fed-\neral court. Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 524 (2002).  \nAs stated by this Court, \u201cBeyond doubt, Congress \nenacted \u00a7 1997e(a) to reduce the quantity and improve \nthe quality of prisoner suits.\u201d Id. at 524. To further \nthis end, \u201cCongress afforded corrections officials time \nand opportunity to address complaints internally\u201d \nprior to prisoners seeking relief in federal court. Id. at \n525. By giving correctional officials the opportunity to \naddress grievances, \u201ccorrective action taken in re-\nsponse to an inmate\u2019s grievance might improve prison \nadministration and satisfy the inmate, thereby obvi-\nating the need for litigation.\u201d Id. (citing Booth v. \nChurner, 532 U.S. 731, 737 (2001)). In addition, a \nprison\u2019s \u201cinternal review might \u2018filter out some frivo-\nlous claims.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting Booth, 532 U.S. at 737). \nAnd the administrative record created by the prisons\u2019 \ninternal grievance processes would facilitate consider-\nation of those \u201ccases ultimately brought to court.\u201d Id. \n(citations omitted).  \nThe PLRA has been tremendously successful in \nreducing the burden on both prison officials and fed-\neral courts. From the peak of filings in 1995, within \nfive years of the passage of the PLRA prisoner law-\nsuits had fallen by 43%, even though the total prisoner \npopulation grew by 23%. Margo Schlanger, Inmate \n\n6 \n \nLitigation, 116 Harv. L. Rev. 1555, 1694 (2003). This \ndecline continued for several more years. By 2006, the \ndecline reached 60%. Margo Schlanger & Giovanna \nShay, Preserving the Rule of Law in America\u2019s Jails \nand Prisons: The Case for Amending the Prison Liti-\ngation Reform Act, 11 U. Pa. J. Const. L. 139, 141\u201342 \n(2008). Although the decline gradually plateaued, by \n2014, prisoners filed 25,324 lawsuits, a rate of 11.6 per \n1,000 prisoners. Schlanger, Trends in Prisoner Litiga-\ntion, supra, at 71. Compared to 1995, this represents \na 34% decrease in the number of prisoner lawsuits and \na 53% decline in the rate of lawsuits filed per 1,000 \nprisoners. See id. The exhaustion requirement has \nbeen a critical component of the PLRA\u2019s success.  \nB. MDOC\u2019s grievance process \nThe Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC) \nhas two separate processes for grievances. One is the \nstandard grievance procedure, governed by MDOC \nPolicy Directive 03.02.130, which is not applicable \nhere. J.A. 41\u201361. The other is the administrative pro-\ncess under the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA), \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 15601, et seq., and the Prohibited Sexual \nConduct Involving Prisoners policy (effective date \n04/24/2017), governed by MDOC Policy Directive \n03.03.140. J.A. 62\u201387.  \nThe PREA grievance procedure applies to Rich-\nards\u2019 claims of sexual abuse, harassment, and miscon-\nduct. MDOC uses a two-step process for PREA griev-\nances, both of which must be exhausted. J.A. 74\u201375. \nMDOC will not facially reject or deny grievances al-\nleging sexual abuse. J.A. 74\u201375. Instead, such \n\n7 \n \ngrievances must be investigated. J.A. 76. \u201cA prisoner \nmay file a PREA grievance at any time.\u201d J.A. 75.  \nA prisoner initiates the first step of the process by \nfiling a PREA Prisoner Grievance Form (Step I). \nJ.A. 75. Prisoners may grieve retaliation for reporting \nsexual abuse, harassment, or misconduct through the \nPREA grievance process. J.A. 72\u201373. PREA griev-\nances may not be referred to MDOC staff who are the \nsubject of the grievance. J.A. 76.  \nAt Step I, the PREA Coordinator1 must ensure \nthat \u201ca written response is provided to the prisoner \nwithin 60 calendar days of receipt of the Step I PREA \nGrievance,\u201d although an extension of up to 70 calen-\ndar days may be requested. J.A. 76\u201377. Prisoners \nmust be notified in writing of any extensions and the \ndue date for a response. J.A. 76\u201377.  \nPrisoners may appeal a Step I decision to Step II \nif they are unsatisfied with the response or the re-\nsponse was not timely. J.A. 77. MDOC\u2019s response to a \nStep II appeal is due within 90 calendar days of re-\nceipt, absent an extension, and it constitutes the final \ndecision in the matter. J.A. 77.  \nC. District Court Proceedings and Eviden-\ntiary Hearing \nRichards and co-Plaintiffs Kenneth Damon Pruitt \nand Robert Kissee filed suit under \u00a7 1983, alleging \nthat Perttu, a Resident Unit Manager (RUM) for the \nMDOC, sexually harassed them and other prisoners, \n \n1 Every prison has a PREA Coordinator designated by the war-\nden. J.A. 67.  \n\n8 \n \nretaliated against them, and destroyed their property, \nin violation of the First, Fifth, and Eighth Amend-\nments. J.A. 1\u201338. Perttu moved for summary judg-\nment, asserting that Richards and his co-Plaintiffs \nfailed to exhaust administrative remedies before filing \ntheir complaint. Pet. App. 3a. Richards and his co-\nPlaintiffs alleged that Perttu had destroyed their \ngrievances or otherwise prevented them from being \nprocessed, making the grievance process unavailable. \nPet. App. 30a, 37a, 59a\u201360a. \nThe district court denied Perttu\u2019s motion, finding \nthat there was a question of fact as to whether the \ngrievance process was available to Richards due to his \nallegation that Perttu interfered with his grievance \nfilings. Pet. App. 79a\u201381a, 83a.  \nFollowing this ruling, the magistrate judge con-\nducted an evidentiary hearing on the issue of exhaus-\ntion. J.A. 88\u2013368. Evaluating the testimony, evidence, \nand arguments presented, the magistrate judge rec-\nommended that the district court conclude that Perttu \ncarried his burden of establishing \u201cthat Plaintiffs \nfailed to exhaust any of their claims before filing suit,\u201d \nPet. App. 64a, 76a, and that the \u201cadministrative rem-\nedies were generally available\u201d to Richards and his co-\nPlaintiffs. Pet. App. 68a.  \nIn reaching that conclusion, the magistrate judge \nfound that Richards\u2019 direct examinations, which re-\nlied on leading questions, undermined the credibility \nof his witnesses. Pet. App. 69a. The magistrate judge \nthen discussed how the circumstances surrounding \nthe alleged observations of Perttu destroying griev-\nances similarly undermined Plaintiffs\u2019 credibility. Pet. \nApp. 71a\u201373a. Notably, the evidence \u201cdemonstrate[d] \n\n9 \n \nthat RUM Perttu could not, and in fact did not, inter-\ncept and destroy all grievances filed by Plaintiffs in \nthe relevant time\u201d: \n[E]ven on the dates that RUM Perttu worked, \nhe testified that he only works from 7:00am to \n3:30pm. Moreover, RUM Perttu did not work \nseven days a week every week from June 2019 \nto March 2020. Indeed, on at least one of the \ndates on which Richards alleges Perttu de-\nstroyed his grievances, January 1, 2020, \nPerttu testified that he was not working due \nto the New Years holiday. \nPet. App. 73a\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

District Court Proceedings and \nEvidentiary Hearing ...................................... 7 \nD. Sixth Circuit Proceedings ............................ 11 \nSummary of Argument ............................................. 13 \nArgument .................................................................. 16 \nI. \nThe Seventh Amendment does not preserve \nthe right to a jury trial on factual questions \nconcerning exhaustion. ....................................... 16 \nA. This Court has held that judges can \ndecide facts related to threshold issues\u2014\nlike exhaustion\u2014without violating the \nSeventh Amendment. .................................. 16 \nB. The Seventh Amendment does not \npreserve the right to a jury trial on any \nfactual questions concerning exhaustion \nbecause exhaustion derives from equity. .... 19 \n\niii \n \n1. The Seventh Amendment guarantees \na jury trial right only as to issues \ntried by a jury in suits at common \nlaw at the time the Seventh \nAmendment was adopted. ..................... 20 \n2. Exhaustion did not exist at the \ncommon law, but closely analogous \nequitable issues were not decided by \njuries in 1791. ........................................ 22 \na. No historical antecedent to \nexhaustion existed at common \nlaw, but its origins are equitable \nin nature. ......................................... 23 \nb. Traditional equitable defenses \nsuch as adequate remedy at law, \nforum non conveniens, \nabstention, and habeas corpus \nbars are an appropriate common-\nlaw analog for exhaustion. .............. 27 \n3. Juries did not historically determine \nquestions of fact related to equitable \ndefenses analogous to exhaustion. ........ 33 \n4. Functional considerations \ndemonstrate that judges, not juries, \nshould determine exhaustion \nquestions. ............................................... 35 \nII. The Seventh Amendment does not preserve \nthe right to a jury trial on factual questions \nconcerning exhaustion even when those \nfactual questions are intertwined with the \nunderlying merits. .............................................. 37 \n\niv \n \nA. Beacon Theatres created a presumption \nthat juries should decide intertwined \nlegal and equitable issues, but that \npresumption does not apply here. ............... 38 \n1. The presumption does not apply \nbecause exhaustion is a threshold \nissue that is logically precedent to the \nmerits. .................................................... 41 \n2. The presumption does not apply \nbecause a judge\u2019s factual findings \nregarding exhaustion would not \npreclude a jury\u2019s consideration of the \nsame facts when determining the \nmerits of the legal claim. ....................... 43 \nB. Unlike in Beacon Theatres, a judicial \ndetermination of exhaustion would \nimplement congressional intent. ................. 46 \nConclusion ................................................................. 48 \n \n\nv \n \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES \nPage \nCases \nAlbino v.

The \nopinion of the United States District Court for the \nWestern District of Michigan (Pet. App. 22a\u201328a) is \nnot reported but is available at 2022 WL 842654. \nJURISDICTION \nThe district court had jurisdiction over claims \nbrought by Respondent Kyle Brandon Richards under \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. The district \ncourt entered judgment for Petitioner Thomas Perttu \non March 22, 2022. Richards filed a timely notice of \nappeal by right on April 11, 2022. The court of appeals \nhad jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s final \njudgment under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. This Court has ju-\nrisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \n \n \n\n2 \n \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe Seventh Amendment to the United States \nConstitution, U.S. Const. amend. VII, provides: \nIn suits at common law, where the value in \ncontroversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the \nright of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no \nfact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-ex-\namined in any Court of the United States, \nthan according to the rules of the common law. \nThe Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a), states in applicable part: \n(a) No action shall be brought with respect to \nprison conditions under section 1983 of this ti-\ntle, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner \nconfined in any jail, prison, or other correc-\ntional facility until such administrative reme-\ndies as are available are exhausted. \nINTRODUCTION \nThe importance of the Seventh Amendment right \nto a trial by jury is well recognized. Less clear, but \nequally important, is the central principle that under-\ngirds the right: preservation of the right to a jury\u2019s ul-\ntimate determination of issues of fact where a case \nproceeds to trial. Embedded in that principle is a tacit \nlimitation\u2014the Seventh Amendment does not guar-\nantee the right to a jury trial on every fact question \nwithin a jury-triable case. Rather, the right is impli-\ncated only when a particular issue or trial decision \nmust fall to the jury to maintain the substance of the \n\n3 \n \ncommon-law right as it existed in 1791. This limita-\ntion is consistent with this Court\u2019s jurisprudence\u2014\nboth its historical view of the Seventh Amendment \nand its treatment of cases involving an overlap of legal \nand equitable issues that implicate collateral estoppel \nconcerns as opposed to cases where those concerns are \nnot present.  \nThe issue of exhaustion under the PLRA is not one \nfor a jury. Exhaustion has no precise historical analog, \nand the closest analogs are forum-based equitable de-\nfenses, which were historically decided by judges, not \nby juries.  \nThis understanding endures even where the facts \nunderlying the question of exhaustion are intertwined \nwith the merits of a prisoner\u2019s claim. In this circum-\nstance, a judge\u2019s determination as to exhaustion does \nnot impinge on the \u201csubstance\u201d of the jury trial right\u2014\nthat right remains preserved. Where the prisoner has \nproperly exhausted administrative remedies, a jury \nmay then be impaneled to find the facts concerning \nthe underlying claims and will not be bound by the \njudge\u2019s earlier factual determinations. This division of \nduties is consistent with a judge\u2019s gatekeeping role, \ncomports with the goals of the PLRA, and protects the \nright to trial by jury. \n \n \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. The PLRA Framework \nIn 1970, just over 2,000 prisoner civil rights suits \nwere filed in federal courts. Margo Schlanger, Trends \nin Prisoner Litigation, as the PLRA Approaches 20, 28 \nCorr. L. Reporter, 69, 71 (2017). Shortly after that, fil-\nings exploded. Id.  \nIn 1980, Congress took a first stab at an exhaus-\ntion provision for prisoner suits filed under \u00a7 1983. \nUnder the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons \nAct, 94 Stat. 352, as amended, district courts could \nstay a prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 1983 suit for up to 180 days while \nthe prisoner pursued \u201cplain, speedy, and effective ad-\nministrative remedies.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a)(1) (for-\nmer). The exhaustion requirement was discretionary \nthough\u2014exhaustion could be required only if the \nstate\u2019s prison grievance system met federal standards \nand if exhaustion was \u201cappropriate and in the inter-\nests of justice.\u201d \u00a7 1997e(a)(1), (2). \nBut that exhaustion provision did not stem the \ntide of prisoner litigation. By the mid-1990s, correc-\ntional systems and federal courts were overburdened \nby a mammoth caseload of prisoner litigation. In 1995 \nalone, 39,053 prisoner lawsuits were filed in federal \ncourt, a rate of 24.6 per 1,000 prisoners. Schlanger, \nTrends in Prisoner Litigation, supra, at 71. Not sur-\nprisingly, this strained the resources of the federal \ncourt system, not to mention correctional systems.  \nIn 1996, Congress enacted the PLRA \u201cin the wake \nof a sharp rise in prisoner litigation in the federal \ncourts.\u201d Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 84 (2006) \n\n5 \n \n(citing Alexander v. Hawk, 159 F.3d 1321, 1324\u201325 \n(11th Cir. 1998) (citing statistics)). A significant com-\nponent of the PLRA was a robust, mandatory exhaus-\ntion requirement. Congress \u201cinvigorated the exhaus-\ntion prescription\u201d that had existed under the prior re-\ngime, now requiring prisoners to fully exhaust all of \ntheir available administrative remedies through the \ngrievance process as a prerequisite to filing suit in fed-\neral court. Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 524 (2002).  \nAs stated by this Court, \u201cBeyond doubt, Congress \nenacted \u00a7 1997e(a) to reduce the quantity and improve \nthe quality of prisoner suits.\u201d Id. at 524. To further \nthis end, \u201cCongress afforded corrections officials time \nand opportunity to address complaints internally\u201d \nprior to prisoners seeking relief in federal court. Id. at \n525. By giving correctional officials the opportunity to \naddress grievances, \u201ccorrective action taken in re-\nsponse to an inmate\u2019s grievance might improve prison \nadministration and satisfy the inmate, thereby obvi-\nating the need for litigation.\u201d Id. (citing Booth v. \nChurner, 532 U.S. 731, 737 (2001)). In addition, a \nprison\u2019s \u201cinternal review might \u2018filter out some frivo-\nlous claims.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting Booth, 532 U.S. at 737). \nAnd the administrative record created by the prisons\u2019 \ninternal grievance processes would facilitate consider-\nation of those \u201ccases ultimately brought to court.\u201d Id. \n(citations omitted).  \nThe PLRA has been tremendously successful in \nreducing the burden on both prison officials and fed-\neral courts. From the peak of filings in 1995, within \nfive years of the passage of the PLRA prisoner law-\nsuits had fallen by 43%, even though the total prisoner \npopulation grew by 23%. Margo Schlanger, Inmate \n\n6 \n \nLitigation, 116 Harv. L. Rev. 1555, 1694 (2003). This \ndecline continued for several more years. By 2006, the \ndecline reached 60%. Margo Schlanger & Giovanna \nShay, Preserving the Rule of Law in America\u2019s Jails \nand Prisons: The Case for Amending the Prison Liti-\ngation Reform Act, 11 U. Pa. J. Const. L. 139, 141\u201342 \n(2008). Although the decline gradually plateaued, by \n2014, prisoners filed 25,324 lawsuits, a rate of 11.6 per \n1,000 prisoners. Schlanger, Trends in Prisoner Litiga-\ntion, supra, at 71. Compared to 1995, this represents \na 34% decrease in the number of prisoner lawsuits and \na 53% decline in the rate of lawsuits filed per 1,000 \nprisoners. See id. The exhaustion requirement has \nbeen a critical component of the PLRA\u2019s success.  \nB. MDOC\u2019s grievance process \nThe Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC) \nhas two separate processes for grievances. One is the \nstandard grievance procedure, governed by MDOC \nPolicy Directive 03.02.130, which is not applicable \nhere. J.A. 41\u201361. The other is the administrative pro-\ncess under the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA), \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 15601, et seq., and the Prohibited Sexual \nConduct Involving Prisoners policy (effective date \n04/24/2017), governed by MDOC Policy Directive \n03.03.140. J.A. 62\u201387.  \nThe PREA grievance procedure applies to Rich-\nards\u2019 claims of sexual abuse, harassment, and miscon-\nduct. MDOC uses a two-step process for PREA griev-\nances, both of which must be exhausted. J.A. 74\u201375. \nMDOC will not facially reject or deny grievances al-\nleging sexual abuse. J.A. 74\u201375. Instead, such \n\n7 \n \ngrievances must be investigated. J.A. 76. \u201cA prisoner \nmay file a PREA grievance at any time.\u201d J.A. 75.  \nA prisoner initiates the first step of the process by \nfiling a PREA Prisoner Grievance Form (Step I). \nJ.A. 75. Prisoners may grieve retaliation for reporting \nsexual abuse, harassment, or misconduct through the \nPREA grievance process. J.A. 72\u201373. PREA griev-\nances may not be referred to MDOC staff who are the \nsubject of the grievance. J.A. 76.  \nAt Step I, the PREA Coordinator1 must ensure \nthat \u201ca written response is provided to the prisoner \nwithin 60 calendar days of receipt of the Step I PREA \nGrievance,\u201d although an extension of up to 70 calen-\ndar days may be requested. J.A. 76\u201377. Prisoners \nmust be notified in writing of any extensions and the \ndue date for a response. J.A. 76\u201377.  \nPrisoners may appeal a Step I decision to Step II \nif they are unsatisfied with the response or the re-\nsponse was not timely. J.A. 77. MDOC\u2019s response to a \nStep II appeal is due within 90 calendar days of re-\nceipt, absent an extension, and it constitutes the final \ndecision in the matter. J.A. 77.  \nC. District Court Proceedings and Eviden-\ntiary Hearing \nRichards and co-Plaintiffs Kenneth Damon Pruitt \nand Robert Kissee filed suit under \u00a7 1983, alleging \nthat Perttu, a Resident Unit Manager (RUM) for the \nMDOC, sexually harassed them and other prisoners, \n \n1 Every prison has a PREA Coordinator designated by the war-\nden. J.A. 67.  \n\n8 \n \nretaliated against them, and destroyed their property, \nin violation of the First, Fifth, and Eighth Amend-\nments. J.A. 1\u201338. Perttu moved for summary judg-\nment, asserting that Richards and his co-Plaintiffs \nfailed to exhaust administrative remedies before filing \ntheir complaint. Pet. App. 3a. Richards and his co-\nPlaintiffs alleged that Perttu had destroyed their \ngrievances or otherwise prevented them from being \nprocessed, making the grievance process unavailable. \nPet. App. 30a, 37a, 59a\u201360a. \nThe district court denied Perttu\u2019s motion, finding \nthat there was a question of fact as to whether the \ngrievance process was available to Richards due to his \nallegation that Perttu interfered with his grievance \nfilings. Pet. App. 79a\u201381a, 83a.  \nFollowing this ruling, the magistrate judge con-\nducted an evidentiary hearing on the issue of exhaus-\ntion. J.A. 88\u2013368. Evaluating the testimony, evidence, \nand arguments presented, the magistrate judge rec-\nommended that the district court conclude that Perttu \ncarried his burden of establishing \u201cthat Plaintiffs \nfailed to exhaust any of their claims before filing suit,\u201d \nPet. App. 64a, 76a, and that the \u201cadministrative rem-\nedies were generally available\u201d to Richards and his co-\nPlaintiffs. Pet. App. 68a.  \nIn reaching that conclusion, the magistrate judge \nfound that Richards\u2019 direct examinations, which re-\nlied on leading questions, undermined the credibility \nof his witnesses. Pet. App. 69a. The magistrate judge \nthen discussed how the circumstances surrounding \nthe alleged observations of Perttu destroying griev-\nances similarly undermined Plaintiffs\u2019 credibility. Pet. \nApp. 71a\u201373a. Notably, the evidence \u201cdemonstrate[d] \n\n9 \n \nthat RUM Perttu could not, and in fact did not, inter-\ncept and destroy all grievances filed by Plaintiffs in \nthe relevant time\u201d: \n[E]ven on the dates that RUM Perttu worked, \nhe testified that he only works from 7:00am to \n3:30pm. Moreover, RUM Perttu did not work \nseven days a week every week from June 2019 \nto March 2020. Indeed, on at least one of the \ndates on which Richards alleges Perttu de-\nstroyed his grievances, January 1, 2020, \nPerttu testified that he was not working due \nto the New Years holiday. \nPet. App. 73a. \nMoreover, the evidence showed that Richards had \naccess to the grievance process: \nBut even had Perttu been working every hour \nof every day . . . Richards actually took ad-\nvantage of the grievance procedure by filing \nStep I grievance forms twenty-six times be-\ntween June 6, 2019, and April 23, 2020.  \n* * * \nMoreover, of Richards\u2019s six Step I grievance \nforms entered into evidence, three specifically \ngrieved RUM Perttu, undermining any allega-\ntion that Perttu sorted through the grievances \nand discarded those directed towards him.  \nPet. App. 73a\u201374a.  \n\n10 \n \nThe magistrate judge noted that \u201cRichards\u2019s suc-\ncessful use of the grievance procedure . . . directly con-\ntradicts Plaintiffs\u2019 claim that administrative remedies \nwere effectively unavailable, and Plaintiffs\u2019 failure \n[to] use any of the alternative reporting methods . . . \ncasts doubt on their alleged attempts to file PREA \ngrievances.\u201d Pet. App. 75a.  \nThe magistrate judge found that \u201cPlaintiffs pro-\nvided no evidence that RUM Perttu\u201d influenced the \ncorrections officers he supervised to destroy or not \nprocess their grievances. Pet. App. 75a. Indeed, \u201cthe \ncredibility of Plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses was undermined by \ntheir inability to independently recollect the time or \nlocation of RUM Perttu\u2019s alleged destruction of Plain-\ntiff\u2019s grievances, as well as the unlikely circumstances \nunder which they claimed they observed such destruc-\ntion.\u201d Pet. App. 75a\u201376a. For instance, as a matter of \n\u201ccommon sense,\u201d Perttu could not have been \u201cpresent \nto intercept every grievance\u201d filed by Plaintiffs. Pet. \nApp. 76a. Based on these findings, the magistrate \njudge recommended that the district court conclude \nthat Richards and his co-Plaintiffs failed to exhaust \ntheir claims against Perttu and dismiss their claims \nwithout prejudice. Pet. App. 76a.  \nRichards and his co-Plaintiffs filed nine objec-\ntions, which the district court overruled. Pet. App. \n22a\u201328a. The district court adopted the report and \nrecommendation and entered judgment for Perttu. \nPet. App. 29a. Richards alone appealed the district \ncourt\u2019s ruling.  \n\n11 \n \nD. Sixth Circuit Proceedings \nOn appeal, Richards argued that the district court \nerred by not granting him a jury trial to resolve the \nexhaustion issue, which he claimed was intertwined \nwith the merits of his case.  \nThe Sixth Circuit began its analysis by discussing \nwhether the exhaustion issue was intertwined with \nRichards\u2019 underlying retaliation claim, noting that \nRichards alleged that Perttu destroyed his grievances, \npreventing him from exhausting the grievance re-\nquirements. Richards\u2019 complaint, the Sixth Circuit \nsaid, \u201clays out several specific instances when Perttu \nallegedly destroyed grievances that Richards had in-\ntended to file.\u201d Pet. App. 2a\u20133a. This allegedly \u201cinter-\nfered with Richards\u2019s speech.\u201d Pet. App. 10a. Under \nthese circumstances, the court concluded that \u201cthe \nfactual disputes regarding exhaustion . . . are inter-\ntwined with the merits of Richards\u2019s retaliation \nclaim.\u201d Pet. App. 12a. \nThe Sixth Circuit turned its attention to whether \nthis intertwining implicated the Seventh Amendment \nright to a jury trial. The court recognized that, in Lee \nv. Willey, 789 F.3d 673 (6th Cir. 2015), it held that the \nprisoner had no right to a jury trial for an exhaustion \ndefense under the PLRA. Pet. App. 13a. But the court \nnoted that Lee did not govern the present case because \nthe disputed facts of the exhaustion issue were not \n\u201c \u2018bound up with the merits of the underlying dis-\npute.\u2019 \u201d Pet. App. 13a (quoting Lee, 789 F.3d at 678).  \nThe Sixth Circuit then looked to the other circuits, \nnoting that only the Seventh Circuit had squarely ad-\ndressed the issue, in Pavey v. Conley, 544 F.3d 739 \n\n12 \n \n(7th Cir. 2008). There, the Seventh Circuit held that \nprisoners had no right to a jury trial to determine \nwhether they had exhausted their administrative \nremedies under the PLRA, regardless of whether the \nexhaustion issue is intertwined with the merits of the \ncase. Pet. App. 14a (citing Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741\u201342). \nAccording to the Seventh Circuit, \u201c[j]uries decide \ncases, not issues of judicial traffic control.\u201d Pavey, 544 \nF.3d at 741. The Ninth Circuit agreed with the rea-\nsoning of Pavey in Albino v. Baca, 747 F.3d 1162, 1171 \n(9th Cir. 2014) (en banc) (citations omitted). Pet. App. \n14a. \nInstead of following the reasoning of the Seventh \nand Ninth Circuits, the Sixth Circuit found \u201cseveral \ndistrict-court decisions in the Second Circuit\u201d more \nconvincing. Pet. App. 15a\u201317a. It ultimately con-\ncluded that \u201cRichards was stripped of his right to a \njury\u2019s resolution of the ultimate dispute\u201d because he \nwas denied a jury trial on the exhaustion issue. Pet. \nApp. 17a (internal citation omitted). The Sixth Circuit \nalso relied on Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Co. v. Rail-\nway Express Agency, Inc., 253 F.2d 780, 784 (6th Cir. \n1958). Pet. App. 17a\u201319a. In Fireman\u2019s Fund, the \nSixth Circuit had held that when jurisdiction is inter-\ntwined with the merits of the case, the issue cannot be \nsummarily decided where factual claims would not be \nsubject to cross-examination. 253 F.2d at 784 (\u201cthe \nmerits of a controversy could be summarily decided, \npartly on affidavits without the right of cross-exami-\nnation\u201d) (citation omitted). \nThe Sixth Circuit held that the district court erred \nby ordering an evidentiary hearing rather than a jury \ntrial on the issue of exhaustion, \u201cemphasiz[ing] that a \n\n13 \n \njury trial is appropriate in these circumstances only if \nthe district court finds that genuine disputes of mate-\nrial fact concerning PLRA exhaustion are \u2018decisive of \nthe merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claim.\u2019 \u201d Pet. App. 19a \n(quoting Fireman\u2019s Fund, 253 F.2d at 784). \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe PLRA mandates that prisoners exhaust ad-\nministrative remedies before filing a lawsuit in fed-\neral court. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). Despite this precon-\ndition to suit, the Sixth Circuit held that prisoners are \nentitled to a jury trial when exhaustion disputes are \nintertwined with the merits of their claims. This con-\nclusion is not grounded in the Seventh Amendment. \n1. The Seventh Amendment permits courts to re-\nsolve disputed facts bearing on whether prisoners \nhave exhausted their claims. The Amendment pre-\nserves the right to a jury trial as it existed under the \nEnglish common law in 1791. Consistent with the \nAmendment\u2019s language, this Court has adhered to a \n\u201chistorical test,\u201d which asks two questions: (1) \nwhether the cause of action at issue \u201ceither was tried \nat law at the time of the founding or is at least analo-\ngous to one that was,\u201d Markman v. Westview Instru-\nments, Inc., 517 U.S. 370, 376 (1996) (citation omit-\nted), and (2) \u201c[i]f the action in question belongs in the \nlaw category, . . . whether the particular [issue] . . . \nmust fall to the jury in order to preserve the substance \nof the common-law right as it existed in 1791,\u201d id.  \nThis case turns on the second question, which, as \nthis Court has emphasized, \u201cmust depend on whether \nthe jury must shoulder this responsibility as neces-\nsary to preserve the \u2018substance of the common-law \n\n14 \n \nright of trial by jury.\u2019 \u201d Tull v. United States, 481 U.S. \n412, 426 (1987) (quoting Colgrove v. Battin, 413 U.S. \n149, 157 (1973)). The Court answers this question \nmuch like its first\u2014by using a historical method, and \n\u201c[w]here there is no exact antecedent,\u201d by \u201ccomparing \nthe modern practice to earlier ones whose allocation \nto court or jury we do know.\u201d Markman, 517 U.S. at \n378 (citations omitted).  \nExhaustion did not exist in 1791, and it was not \nuntil the twentieth century that courts fully articu-\nlated the doctrine. Thus, there is no exact antecedent \nto look to for answers. But exhaustion\u2019s roots in courts \nof equity provide helpful guidance. Exhaustion was \napplied by those courts to promote an orderly proce-\ndure whereby an administrative forum was the appro-\npriate starting point for a dispute. Other forum-based \nequitable defenses\u2014such as the adequate remedy at \nlaw doctrine, forum non conveniens, abstention, and \nhabeas corpus bars\u2014therefore provide a suitable his-\ntorical analog.  \nAt common law, these defenses were not afforded \na jury trial right. This was true regardless of whether \nthose defenses were interposed in courts of law, in \nwhich case a court of equity would first dispose of the \nissue. Only where an issue at law remained would \nthat issue be jury-triable. Because these equitable de-\nfenses were not subject to a jury determination at \ncommon law, neither should exhaustion.  \nEven if these historical analogs are insufficient, \nfunctional considerations should guide this Court\u2019s \ndecision. In this regard, the PLRA\u2019s goals\u2014\u201cto reduce \nthe quantity and improve the quality of prisoner \nsuits,\u201d \nPorter, \n534 \nU.S. \nat \n524\u2014would \nbe \n\n15 \n \ncompromised, if not outright defeated, by a jury trial \non exhaustion. The PLRA allows prison officials the \nopportunity to address prisoner complaints prior to \nfederal-court interference. This, in turn, obviates the \nneed for some prisoner lawsuits and creates an admin-\nistrative record for those that are filed.  \nJudges also frequently decide threshold issues \nand are thus better positioned than juries to decide \nexhaustion questions. And due to the significant num-\nber of prisoner cases judges see, they are particularly \nwell-equipped to deal with questions about a prison\u2019s \ninternal operations. Consequently, an exhaustion \nquestion should be allocated to the judge, not a jury.  \n2. That a question of exhaustion is intertwined \nwith the merits of a prisoner\u2019s claim does not change \nthis outcome. While Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, \n359 U.S. 500 (1959), establishes a general rule priori-\ntizing legal issues over equitable ones, it is a pruden-\ntial rule that is premised on the recognition that an \nequitable determination could have a collateral-estop-\npel effect on the merits of a legal claim. These con-\ncerns are not present for an exhaustion determina-\ntion, which is a threshold, pre-merits ruling that the \njury may revisit if an exhausted claim goes to trial. \nFurther, this Court has previously considered \nwhether application of the Beacon Theatres rule would \nundermine a federal statute. Here, the PLRA\u2019s pur-\nposes would be severely undercut by a jury trial on ex-\nhaustion.  \nFor these reasons, the Seventh Amendment does \nnot preserve the right to a jury trial on exhaustion of \nadministrative remedies where disputed facts regard-\ning exhaustion are intertwined with merits of a claim. \n\n16 \n \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe Seventh Amendment does not preserve \nthe right to a jury trial on factual questions \nconcerning exhaustion. \nJudges frequently decide disputed questions of \nfact without violating the Seventh Amendment, par-\nticularly with respect to threshold issues. It is thus no \nsurprise that all courts of appeal to have considered \nthe issue have held that \u201cjudges may resolve factual \ndisputes relevant to the exhaustion issue without the \nparticipation of a jury.\u201d Small v. Camden Cnty., 728 \nF.3d 265, 269\u201371 (3d Cir. 2013); see also Lee, 789 F.3d \nat 677\u201378; Albino, 747 F.3d at 1170\u201371; Messa v. \nGoord, 652 F.3d 305, 308\u201310 (2d Cir. 2011) (per cu-\nriam); Dillon v. Rogers, 596 F.3d 260, 270\u201372 (5th Cir. \n2010); Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741\u201342; Bryant v. Rich, 530 \nF.3d 1368, 1373\u201377 (11th Cir. 2008). These holdings \nare consistent with the Seventh Amendment, which \napplies only to issues tried by a jury in suits at com-\nmon law in 1791. Exhaustion, although unknown at \ncommon law, is rooted in equity and closely analogous \nto traditional equitable defenses, which were not his-\ntorically determined by juries.  \nA. This Court has held that judges can de-\ncide facts related to threshold issues\u2014\nlike exhaustion\u2014without violating the \nSeventh Amendment.  \nAs a general matter, \u201cissues of law are to be re-\nsolved by the court and issues of fact are to be deter-\nmined by the jury.\u201d Baltimore & Carolina Line, Inc. v. \nRedman, 295 U.S. 654, 657 (1935). But this broad \nproposition overstates the Amendment\u2019s sweep, for \n\n17 \n \n\u201cthe Seventh Amendment was never intended to es-\ntablish the jury as the exclusive mechanism for fact-\nfinding in civil cases.\u201d Atlas Roofing Co. v. Occupa-\ntional Safety & Health Review Comm\u2019n, 430 U.S. 442, \n460 (1977); see also Galloway v. United States, 319 \nU.S. 372, 390 (1943) (\u201cThe jury was not absolute mas-\nter of fact in 1791.\u201d). In this vein, this Court has held \nthat the Seventh Amendment \u201cwas designed to pre-\nserve the basic institution of jury trial in only its most \nfundamental elements, not the great mass of proce-\ndural forms and details, varying even then [in 1791] \nso widely among common-law jurisdictions.\u201d Gallo-\nway, 319 U.S. at 392; see also Walker v. N. M. & S. P. \nR. Co., 165 U.S. 593, 596 (1897) (\u201cThe seventh amend-\nment . . . does not attempt to regulate matters of \npleading or practice[.]\u201d).  \nJudges thus frequently decide disputed questions \nof fact without violating the Seventh Amendment. For \nexample, this Court has held that judges may decide \nquestions of fact related to subject-matter jurisdiction, \nWetmore v. Rymer, 169 U.S. 115, 120\u201322 (1898); dis-\ncovery disputes, Herbert v. Lando, 441 U.S. 153, 177 \n(1979); class certifications, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. \nDukes, 564 U.S. 338, 351\u201352 (2011); evidentiary objec-\ntions, Galloway, 319 U.S. at 390; motions for sum-\nmary judgment, Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 \nU.S. 322, 336 (1979); motions for directed verdict, Gal-\nloway, 283 U.S. at 391\u201395; and motions to set aside \nthe verdict, Gasoline Products Co. v. Champlin Refin-\ning Co., 283 U.S. 494, 497\u201398 (1943).  \n \n \n\n18 \n \nThis makes sense for at least two reasons. First, a \njudge\u2019s ability to determine fact disputes related to \nthreshold questions is consistent with the under-\nstanding that \u201c \u2018[t]he Seventh Amendment does not \nconfer the right to a trial, but only the right to have a \njury hear the case once it is determined that the litiga-\ntion should proceed before a court.\u2019 \u201d Caley v. Gulf-\nstream Aerospace Corp., 428 F.3d 1359, 1371 (11th \nCir. 2005) (quoting Am. Heritage Life Ins. Co. v. Orr, \n294 F.3d 702, 711 (5th Cir. 2002)), cert. denied, 548 \nU.S. 1128 (2006). In this sense a judge acts as a gate-\nkeeper, guarding the courthouse doors from those who \nseek entry but have not yet satisfied mandatory pre-\nconditions to suit. Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741 (\u201cJuries de-\ncide cases, not issues of judicial traffic control.\u201d).  \nSecond, and relatedly, \u201c[t]he limitation imposed \nby the [Seventh] [A]mendment is merely that enjoy-\nment of the right of trial by jury be not obstructed, and \nthat the ultimate determination of issues of fact by the \njury be not interfered with.\u201d In re Peterson, 253 U.S. \n300, 310 (1920) (emphasis added). In other words, the \nSeventh Amendment \u201cis concerned with substance \nand not with form.\u201d Dimick v. Schiedt, 293 U.S. 474, \n490 (1935); see also id. (\u201cThere is nothing in its history \nor language to suggest that the amendment had any \npurpose but to preserve the essentials of the jury trial \nas it was known to the common law before the adop-\ntion of the Constitution.\u201d); Walker, 165 U.S. at 596 \n(\u201cSo long as this substance of right is preserved, the \nprocedure by which this result shall be reached is \nwholly within the discretion of the legislature . . . .\u201d). \nWhere the jury\u2019s ultimate determination of the facts is \nnot obviated, the judge may serve as factfinder. \n\n19 \n \nBoth of these underpinnings apply with full force \nin the exhaustion context. Exhaustion is a threshold \nquestion. Under the PLRA, \u201c[u]ntil the issue of ex-\nhaustion is resolved, the court cannot know whether \nit is to decide the case or the prison authorities are to.\u201d \nPavey, 544 F.3d at 741. Further, a judge\u2019s exhaustion \ndetermination does not interfere with a jury\u2019s ulti-\nmate factfinding responsibility because dismissals for \nfailure to exhaust are generally without prejudice.2 \nSee Snider v. Melindez, 199 F.3d 108, 111\u201312 (2d Cir. \n1999) (explaining that exhaustion \u201cis often a tempo-\nrary, curable, procedural flaw\u201d). A prisoner may later \nrefile the lawsuit, so long as the prison\u2019s grievance \nprocedure is satisfied. And if the prisoner\u2019s case ulti-\nmately proceeds to trial, the jury may revisit facts \nfound by the judge that may have been relevant to the \nexhaustion determination. See Part II; see also Pavey, \n544 F.3d at 742.  \nB. The Seventh Amendment does not pre-\nserve the right to a jury trial on any fac-\ntual questions concerning exhaustion be-\ncause exhaustion derives from equity.  \nAlthough the types of claims Richards brought are \nthose to which a jury trial applies, this Court has \n \n2 Along these lines, some courts have identified exhaustion as \nmatter in abatement, Bryant, 530 F.3d at 1374; Small, 728 F.3d \nat 269 n.3 (citation omitted), which is unsurprising since \u201cabate-\nment defense[s] defeat the particular action for procedural de-\nfects that are unrelated to the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claim,\u201d and \nthe plaintiff can therefore \u201ctypically correct the defects and pro-\nceed in another action,\u201d Hyman v. City of Gastonia, 466 F.3d 284, \n287 (4th Cir. 2006) (citing Bowles v. Wilke, 175 F.2d 35, 38 (7th \nCir. 1949)).  \n\n20 \n \nrecognized the need for a separate historical analysis \nfor particular issues or trial decisions within jury-ap-\npropriate claims. Under this analysis, there is no ex-\nact antecedent for exhaustion. But its equitable ori-\ngins and the characteristics of the doctrine show that \nits closest parallel lies in equitable defenses\u2014which \nwere historically decided by judges, not juries.  \n1. The Seventh Amendment guarantees \na jury trial right only as to issues \ntried by a jury in suits at common law \nat the time the Seventh Amendment \nwas adopted.  \nThe Seventh Amendment \u201cpreserve[s]\u201d the right \nto jury trial \u201c[i]n Suits at common law.\u201d U.S. Const. \namend. VII. Because the Amendment speaks in terms \nof preservation, this Court has long held that the \nscope of the right must be determined by reference to \nhistory. Indeed, \u201c[f]rom the beginning, it has been re-\ngarded as but subservient to the single purpose of the \nAmendment, to preserve the essentials of the jury \ntrial in actions at law, serving to distinguish them \nfrom suits in equity and admiralty[.]\u201d Dimick, 293 \nU.S. at 490\u201391 (citation omitted); Granfinanciera, \nS.A. v. Nordberg, 492 U.S. 33, 42 (1989) (explaining \nthat the Seventh Amendment applies to actions \u201cthat \nare analogous to common-law causes of action ordi-\nnarily decided in English law courts in the late 18th \ncentury, as opposed to those customarily heard by \ncourts of equity or admiralty\u201d) (citation omitted). Con-\nsistent with this command, \u201cresort must be had to the \nappropriate rules of the common law established at \nthe time of the adoption of that constitutional provi-\nsion in 1791.\u201d Dimick, 293 U.S. at 476. See also \n\n21 \n \nBaltimore & Carolina Line, Inc., 295 U.S. at 657 \n(\u201c[T]he right of trial by jury thus preserved is the right \nwhich existed under the English common law when \nthe Amendment was adopted.\u201d).  \nThis historical lens does not mean that the right \nto a jury trial is available only in suits \u201cwhich the com-\nmon law recognized among its old and settled proceed-\nings.\u201d Parsons v. Bedford, Breedlove & Robeson, 28 \nU.S. 433, 447 (1830). As this Court has noted, histori-\ncal analysis allows for reasoning by analogy. There-\nfore, the determination whether the Seventh Amend-\nment confers a right to a jury trial entails a two-part \ninquiry. A court first considers whether it is \u201c \u2018dealing \nwith a cause of action that either was tried at law at \nthe time of the founding or is at least analogous to one \nthat was.\u2019 \u201d City of Monterey v. Del Monte Dunes at \nMonterey, Ltd., 526 U.S. 687, 708 (1999) (quoting \nMarkman, 517 U.S. at 376). If a court determines that \n\u201cthe action in question belongs in the law category,\u201d it \nmust \u201cthen ask whether the particular trial decision \nmust fall to the jury in order to preserve the substance \nof the common-law right as it existed in 1791.\u201d Mark-\nman, 517 U.S. at 708 (emphasis added). See also Tull, \n481 U.S. at 426 (\u201c \u2018Only those incidents which are re-\ngarded as fundamental, as inherent in and of the es-\nsence of the system of trial by jury, are placed beyond \nthe reach of the legislature.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting Colgrove, 413 \nU.S. at 156 n.11.).  \nAs applied to this case, the first inquiry is \nstraightforward. While the scope of prisoners\u2019 federal \nrights was significantly limited at common law, see, \ne.g., Ruffin v. Commonwealth, 62 Va. 790, 799 (1871); \nBethea v. Crouse, 417 F.2d 504, 505 (10th Cir. 1969), \n\n22 \n \nfollowing Del Monte Dunes, 526 U.S. at 720\u201321, the \ntypes of claims that Richards brought\u2014\u00a7 1983 claims \nfor damages\u2014are those for which a jury trial applies.  \nThis conclusion is not the end of the inquiry, \nthough. Rather, it leads to the second question\u2014\nwhether the particular issue of exhaustion is \u201cproper \nfor determination by the jury.\u201d3 Id. at 718; see also id. \nat 731 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and in concurring \nin the judgment) (\u201cTo say that respondents had the \nright to a jury trial on their \u00a7 1983 claim is not to say \nthat they were entitled to have the jury decide every \nissue.\u201d); Google LLC v. Oracle Am., Inc. 593 U.S. 1, 25 \n(2021) (rejecting an argument that the jury should de-\ncide a fair-use defense). As explained below, it is not.  \n2. Exhaustion did not exist at the com-\nmon law, but closely analogous equi-\ntable issues were not decided by ju-\nries in 1791.  \nTo answer the second question\u2014whether exhaus-\ntion should be determined by a judge or jury\u2014this \nCourt again looks to history, asking \u201cwhether the par-\nticular issue, or analogous ones, were decided by judge \nor by jury in suits at common law at the time the Sev-\nenth Amendment was adopted.\u201d Del Monte Dunes, 526 \nU.S. at 718; see also Markman, 517 U.S. at 378 \n(\u201cWhere there is no exact antecedent, the best hope \n \n3 The practice of submitting some issues for judicial determina-\ntion, while others are submitted to the jury, is consistent with \nFed. R. Civ. P. 39(a) and (a)(2), which provides that a \u201ctrial on all \nissues so demanded must be by jury unless . . . the court . . . finds \nthat on some or all of those issues there is no federal right to a \njury trial.\u201d (Emphasis added).  \n\n23 \n \nlies in comparing the modern practice to earlier ones \nwhose allocation to court or jury we do know . . . seek-\ning the best analogy we can draw between an old and \nthe new.\u201d) (citations omitted); Tull, 481 U.S. at 420\u2013\n21 (explaining that courts must search the common \nlaw for \u201cappropriate analogies\u201d instead of a \u201cprecisely \nanalogous common-law cause of action\u201d). \nAlthough no exact antecedent for exhaustion ex-\nisted at common law, its origins lie in equity. These \norigins and exhaustion\u2019s characteristics result in an \nappropriate analog\u2014equitable defenses\u2014for which \nthere was no traditional right to a jury trial. \na. No historical antecedent to exhaustion \nexisted at common law, but its origins \nare equitable in nature. \nThe doctrine of exhaustion \u201cis as old as federal ad-\nministrative law,\u201d meaning that it did not begin to \ntake shape until the creation of the Interstate Com-\nmerce Commission in 1887. Raoul Berger, Exhaustion \nof Administrative Remedies, 48 Yale L.J. 981, 981 n.1 \n(1939). Intended as a rule of \u201corderly\u201d procedure de-\nsigned to allow administrative bodies to perform their \nstatutory functions without preliminary interference \nfrom the courts, United States v. Sing Tuck, 194 U.S. \n161, 168 (1904), the concept first arose in tax cases in \nwhich courts of equity refused to grant injunctive re-\nlief where a plaintiff failed to pursue administrative \nremedies.  \nIn Dundee Mortgage Trust Invest Co. v. Charlton, \n32 F. 192, 192\u201393 (C.C.D. Ore. 1887), for example, a \ncorporation brought suit in equity to enjoin the \n\n24 \n \ncollection of its taxes, arguing that the county asses-\nsor and county board of equalization had erred in their \nassessment. While the court agreed that the corpora-\ntion \u201cappear[ed] to be entitled to an injunction,\u201d id. at \n193, it nevertheless held that the corporation was not \nentitled to relief because it did not seek redress from \nthe county board of equalization, as provided by stat-\nute, id. at 193\u201394. \u201c[T]he plaintiff, having neglected to \navail itself of this means of redress, cannot maintain \na suit for relief in this court.\u201d Id. at 195; see also Alt-\nschul v. Gittings, 86 F. 200, 202 (C.C.D. Ore. 1898) \n(No. 2,236) (same); Brown v. Drain, 112 F. 582, 585 \n(C.C.S.D. Cal. 1901) (\u201cThe remedy of one who consid-\ners himself unfairly assessed is to apply for redress to \nthe statutory tribunal, if one is provided with the \npower to review.\u201d).  \nThe exhaustion concept was applied in courts of \nequity in other contexts as well. In Sing Tuck, an im-\nmigration case in which the Court denied a writ a ha-\nbeas corpus, the Court concluded that the petitioner \nfailed to comply with the \u201cmode of procedure which \nmust be followed before there can be resort to the \ncourts.\u201d 194 U.S. at 167. Explaining that \u201cit is one of \nthe necessities of the administration of justice that \neven fundamental questions should be determined in \nan orderly way,\u201d the Court reasoned that the peti-\ntioner failed to first file an appeal with the Secretary \nof Commerce and Labor. Id. at 168. The Court analo-\ngized the exhaustion requirement to habeas corpus \ncases arising out of state confinement:  \nA familiar illustration is that of a person im-\nprisoned upon criminal process by a state \ncourt, under a state law alleged to be \n\n25 \n \nunconstitutional. If the law is unconstitu-\ntional the prisoner is wrongfully held. Yet, ex-\ncept under exceptional circumstances, the \ncourts of the United States do not interfere by \nhabeas corpus. The prisoner must, in the first \nplace, take his case to the highest court of the \nstate to which he can go, and after that he gen-\nerally is left to the remedy by writ of error if \nhe wishes to bring the case here.  \nId. (citations omitted). Because the petitioner failed to \nfirst resort to his administrative remedy, any attempt \n\u201cto swamp the courts by resort to them in the first in-\nstance[ ] must fail.\u201d Id. at 170; see also id. (\u201c[B]efore \nthe courts can be called upon, the preliminary sifting \nprocess provided by the statutes must be gone through \nwith. Whether after that a further trial may be had \nwe do not decide.\u201d). Other cases highlight exhaustion\u2019s \nequitable origins. E.g. Pittsburgh Ry. v. Bd. of Pub. \nWorks, 172 U.S. 32, 47 (1898); United States v. Abilene \n& S. Ry. Co., 265 U.S. 274, 282 (1924); United States \nv. Ill. Cent. R.R. Co., 291 U.S. 457, 463 (1934); Natural \nGas Pipeline Co. v. Slattery, 302 U.S. 300, 310\u201311 \n(1937).  \nWhile these cases confirm exhaustion\u2019s equitable \norigins, the doctrine, as we understand it today, did \nnot fully emerge until the twentieth century. See John \nF. Duffy, Administrative Common Law in Judicial Re-\nview, 77 Tex. L. Rev. 113, 154 (1998) (explaining that \n\u201c[i]n the early part of th[e] [twentieth] century, the \ndoctrine was still quite amorphous, and as late as the \n1920\u2019s, courts were still using other equitable doc-\ntrines . . . to decide cases that would later be consid-\nered exhaustion precedents\u201d). Indeed, it was only in \n\n26 \n \n1938, in Myers v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Co., 303 \nU.S. 41 (1938), that this Court expressly articulated \nthe modern underpinning of the doctrine. See Duffy, \nsupra, at 155.  \nIn Myers, the Court declined a request to enjoin \nthe National Labor Relations Board\u2019s administrative \nproceedings despite allegations that the NLRB lacked \njurisdiction. Id. at 43, 46. The Court refused to grant \ninjunctive relief, in part on the ground that \u201cno one is \nentitled to judicial relief for a supposed or threatened \ninjury until the prescribed administrative remedy has \nbeen exhausted.\u201d Id. at 50. The Court recognized the \nexhaustion doctrine\u2019s equitable roots, see id. at 51 n.9 \n(\u201cThe rule has been most frequently applied in equity \nwhere relief by injunction was sought\u201d) (citation omit-\nted), and noted the extension of the doctrine to courts \nof law, id. (\u201cbecause the rule is one of judicial admin-\nistration\u2014not merely a rule governing the exercise of \ndiscretion\u2014it is applicable to proceedings at law as \nwell as suits in equity\u201d) (citations omitted). Myers \nstands as \u201cthe seminal decision\u201d on the exhaustion \ndoctrine and has been described as \u201ccomplet[ing] the \ndoctrine\u2019s evolution.\u201d Duffy, supra, at 155. \nIn short, although exhaustion has deep roots in \nequity, the doctrine as we know it today was unknown \nin the late eighteenth century. Consequently, there is \nno \u201cclear historical evidence that the very . . . ques-\ntion\u201d of exhaustion was a question for the jury under \nthe common law. Markman, 517 U.S. at 377. \n\n27 \n \nb. Traditional equitable defenses such as \nadequate remedy at law, forum non \nconveniens, abstention, and habeas \ncorpus bars are an appropriate com-\nmon-law analog for exhaustion.  \nWith no precise analog existing in the English \ncommon law, \u201cthe best hope lies in comparing the \nmodern practice to earlier ones whose allocation to \ncourt or jury we do know, . . . seeking the best analogy \nwe can draw between the old and the new.\u201d Markman, \n517 U.S. at 378 (citations omitted). In this regard, this \nCourt has instructed that the analog be \u201cappropriate\u201d \nrather than \u201cprecise[ ],\u201d Tull, 481 U.S. at 420\u201321, and \ncan be drawn on the basis of function, Markman, 517 \nU.S. at 379\u201380.  \nExhaustion\u2019s foundations in courts of equity pro-\nvide a logical starting point in the search for an appro-\npriate analog. As explained in the prior section, from \nits earliest articulations, it was viewed as a limitation, \nalbeit discretionary, on a court\u2019s equitable jurisdic-\ntion. See Charlton, 32 F. at 195; Altschul, 86 F. at 202. \nIn other words, a court of equity would not exercise its \nextraordinary powers where a plaintiff failed to avail \nitself of an available administrative process. Gorham \nMfg. Co. v. State Tax Comm\u2019n of N.Y., 266 U.S. 265, \n270 (1924) (holding that the petitioner, \u201chaving failed \nto avail itself of the administrative remedy provided \nby the statute . . . was not entitled to maintain a bill \nin equity\u201d); Ill.

Bryan, 937 F.3d 738, 748 (6th \nCir. 2019) (noting that \u201cthe exhaustion \u2018doctrine had \nits origin in a discretionary rule adopted by courts of \nequity to the effect that a petitioner will be denied eq-\nuitable relief when he has failed to pursue an availa-\nble administrative remedy by which he might obtain \nthe same relief.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting Smith v. United States, \n199 F.2d 377, 381 (1st Cir. 1952)).  \nThus, historically, exhaustion was an equitable \ndefense applied by courts when another forum\u2014an \nadministrative tribunal or agency\u2014was the more ap-\npropriate starting point for a dispute. Tracking this \nprinciple, this Court has said that exhaustion \u201cserves \nthe twin purposes of protecting administrative agency \nauthority and promoting judicial efficiency.\u201d McCar-\nthy v. Madigan, 503 U.S. 140, 145 (1992), superseded \nby statute, \u00a7 1997e(a), as recognized in Woodford, 548 \nU.S. at 84\u201385. As to the first purpose, the exhaustion \nrequirement \u201crecognizes the notion, grounded in def-\nerence to Congress\u2019 delegation of authority to coordi-\nnate branches of Government, that agencies, not the \ncourts, ought to have primary responsibility for the \nprograms that Congress has charged them to admin-\nister.\u201d Id.; see id. (\u201cThe exhaustion doctrine recognizes \nthe commonsense notion of dispute resolution that an \nagency ought to have an opportunity to correct its own \nmistakes . . . before it is haled into federal court.\u201d) (em-\nphasis added); Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 492 \n(1973) (\u201cSince the[ ] internal problems of state prisons \ninvolve issues so peculiarly within state authority and \n\n29 \n \nexpertise, the States have an important interest in not \nbeing bypassed in the correction of those problems.\u201d). \nAs to the second purpose, \u201c[w]hen an agency has the \nopportunity to correct its own errors, a judicial contro-\nversy may well be mooted, or at least piecemeal ap-\npeals may be avoided.\u201d McCarthy, 503 U.S. at 145 (ci-\ntations omitted).  \nThese twin purposes call back to early articula-\ntions of the exhaustion doctrine as a rule of \u201corderly\u201d \nprocedure. Sing Tuck, 194 U.S. at 168, 173. And alt-\nhough the exhaustion doctrine was discretionary, as \nopposed to jurisdictional, Slattery, 302 U.S. at 311 (ex-\nplaining that the rule \u201crests in the sound discretion \nwhich guides exercise of equity jurisdiction\u201d) (cita-\ntions omitted); Abilene & S. Ry. Co., 265 U.S. at 282, \nit nevertheless was treated by courts of equity as a \nthreshold inquiry, see Sing Tuck, 194 U.S. at 168, 170.  \nThese guideposts offer a clear path in the search \nfor an appropriate common law analog. Indeed, ex-\nhaustion\u2019s origins as a forum-based equitable defense \ncall to mind other similar equitable defenses\u2014the ad-\nequate remedy at law doctrine, forum non conveniens, \nabstention, and habeas corpus bars.  \nAdequate remedy at law. The adequate remedy at \nlaw doctrine was a fundamental principle guiding \ncourts of equity. These courts \u201cstood ready to fashion \nremedies for legal wrongs, so long as the basic require-\nments of equity\u2014such as irreparable injury and no \nadequate remedy at law\u2014were met.\u201d Duffy, supra, at \n124. See also Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 43\u201344 \n(1971) (\u201cOne is the basic doctrine of equity jurispru-\ndence that courts of equity should not act . . . when the \nmoving party has an adequate remedy at law and will \n\n30 \n \nnot suffer irreparable injury if denied equitable re-\nlief.\u201d); Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U.S. \n374, 381 (1992) (\u201cIt is a \u2018basic doctrine of equity juris-\nprudence that courts of equity should not act . . . when \nthe moving party has an adequate remedy at law[.]\u2019 \u201d) \n(citations omitted).  \nThe adequate remedy at law doctrine was \ngrounded in comity and federalism concerns, with fed-\neral equity courts refusing to provide relief where it \nwas available at law in federal courts of law, Great \nLakes Co. v. Huffman, 319 U.S. 293, 297 (1943) (cita-\ntion omitted), as well as in state proceedings, Trainor \nv. Hernandez, 431 U.S. 434, 441 (1977). This doctrine, \nlike exhaustion, thus focused on whether a court of eq-\nuity should defer to another court (or forum) to hear \nthe dispute. And, like exhaustion, courts viewed the \ndoctrine as a threshold issue. Brown, Bonnell & Co. v. \nLake Superior Iron Co., 134 U.S. 530, 536 (1890) (ex-\nplaining that the adequate remedy at law objection \n\u201cshould be taken at the earliest opportunity\u201d). \nForum non conveniens. Under this equitable, com-\nmon-law doctrine, a federal court may dismiss an ac-\ntion in favor of an alternative forum when, among \nother things, \u201cthe chosen forum [is] inappropriate be-\ncause of considerations affecting the court\u2019s own ad-\nministration and legal problems.\u201d Koster v. Am. Lum-\nbermens Mut. Cas. Co., 330 U.S. 518, 524 (1947); see \nalso Gulf Oil Corp. v. Gilbert, 330 U.S. 501, 506\u201307 \n(1947) (explaining that the doctrine is premised on the \nassumption that there are \u201cat least two forums in \nwhich the defendant is amenable to process\u201d). Both fo-\nrum non conveniens and exhaustion therefore permit \ncourts to consider judicial efficiency in deciding \n\n31 \n \nwhether they are the appropriate forum for a case to \nbe heard. See Sinochem Int\u2019l Co. v. Malaysia Int\u2019l \nShipping Corp., 549 U.S. 422, 432 (2007) (\u201cA district \ncourt . . . may dispose of an action by a forum non con-\nveniens dismissal, bypassing questions of subject-mat-\nter and personal jurisdiction, when considerations of \nconvenience, fairness, and judicial economy so war-\nrant.\u201d).  \nAbstention. \u201c[E]xhaustion of administrative reme-\ndies\u201d in general and \u201cabstention\u201d are \u201crelated doc-\ntrines.\u201d McCarthy, 503 U.S. at 144. As with exhaus-\ntion, the power of a federal court to dismiss a case via \nabstention \u201cderives from the discretion historically \nenjoyed by courts of equity.\u201d Quackenbush v. Allstate \nIns. Co., 517 U.S. 706, 728 (1996). The driving princi-\nples behind exhaustion and abstention also share a \ncommon root\u2014deference to state or administrative \nauthority. See id. at 728 (quoting Burford v. Sun Oil \nCo., 319 U.S. 315, 334 (1943)). Younger abstention, for \nexample, respects a \u201cState\u2019s interest in pursuing an \nongoing state proceeding,\u201d Ohio Bureau of Emp. \nServs. v. Hodory, 431 U.S. 471, 477 (1977) (citations \nomitted), barring a federal court from enjoining a \nstate prosecution, a civil enforcement action, or a \nunique state action that \u201cimplicate[s] a State\u2019s inter-\nest in enforcing the orders and judgments of its \ncourts,\u201d Sprint Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v. Jacobs, 571 U.S. 69, \n72\u201373 (2013). Likewise, PLRA exhaustion requires a \nfederal court to stay its hand where a state has not \nhad its full opportunity to regulate its own prisons by \nconsidering a prisoner\u2019s grievance. \nHabeas Corpus. Federal habeas principles rein-\nforce the analogy between exhaustion and equitable \n\n32 \n \ndefenses. Indeed, this Court explicitly linked PLRA \nexhaustion requirements to certain habeas defenses, \ndeeming them \u201csubstantively similar.\u201d Woodford, 548 \nU.S. at 92; see also Schlesinger v. Councilman, 420 \nU.S. 738, 756 (1975) (noting that \u201cthe practical consid-\nerations supporting . . . the exhaustion requirement in \nhabeas corpus . . . are similar to those that underlie \nthe requirement of exhaustion of administrative rem-\nedies\u201d) (citation omitted).  \nHabeas exhaustion, like PLRA exhaustion, \nsounds in equity. Withrow v. Williams, 507 U.S. 680, \n699 (1993) (\u201cConcerns for equity and federalism reso-\nnate throughout our habeas jurisprudence.\u201d) (Scalia, \nJ., concurring in part); Erica Hashimoto, Reclaiming \nthe Equitable Heritage of Habeas, 108 Nw. U. L. Rev. \n139, 142 (2013) (habeas defenses \u201cshare features that \ncorrespond with the [habeas] remedy\u2019s historical equi-\ntable origins\u201d). Premised on the same equitable under-\npinnings as administrative exhaustion, habeas ex-\nhaustion requires a prisoner to avail himself of all \n\u201cavailable\u201d state-court remedies before entering fed-\neral court to seek a writ of habeas corpus. 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2254(c); see also O\u2019Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U.S. \n838, 847 (1999). \nThe doctrine of procedural default, 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2254(b)(1)(A), (c), another limitation on habeas re-\nlief, also shares similarities with exhaustion. It pre-\nvents federal court review of a claim that has not been \nproperly presented to the state courts. Woodford, 548 \nU.S. at 92. Procedural default guards against \u201cover-\nturning a state-court conviction without the state \ncourts having had an opportunity to correct the con-\nstitutional violation in the first instance.\u201d Id. (quoting \n\n33 \n \nO\u2019Sullivan, 526 U.S. at 845). That requirement mir-\nrors PLRA exhaustion\u2014giving prison systems the op-\nportunity to correct violations before litigating in fed-\neral court. See Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509, 518\u201319 \n(1982). \n3. Juries did not historically determine \nquestions of fact related to equitable \ndefenses analogous to exhaustion.  \nWith these similarities in mind, these equitable \ndefenses offer a sound analog to exhaustion, and \neighteenth-century practices concerning these de-\nfenses are instructive. It is well understood that a \nplaintiff is not entitled to have a jury determine a dis-\nputed affirmative defense that is equitable in nature. \nLiberty Oil Co. v. Condon Nat\u2019l Bank, 260 U.S. 235, \n242\u201343 (1922) (\u201cThe equitable defense makes the is-\nsue equitable, and it is to be tried to the judge as a \nchancellor.\u201d); Tull, 481 U.S. at 417 (\u201c[T]hose actions \nthat are analogous to 18th-century cases tried in \ncourts of equity . . . do not require a jury trial.\u201d) (cita-\ntion omitted); Granite State Ins. Co. v. Smart Modular \nTechs., 76 F.3d 1023, 1027 (9th Cir. 1996) (\u201cA litigant \nis not entitled to have a jury resolve a disputed affirm-\native defense if the defense is equitable in nature.\u201d) \n(citation omitted); Smith v. World Ins. Co., 38 F.3d \n1456, 1462 (8th Cir. 1994) (\u201c[T]he determination of eq-\nuitable defenses and equitable remedies is a matter \nfor the court to decide, not the jury.\u201d). This was true \neven where an equitable defense was \u201cinterposed in \n[an] action at law,\u201d in which circumstance the equita-\nble defense was generally \u201cfirst . . . disposed of as in a \ncourt of equity, and then, if an issue at law remain[ed], \nit [was] triable to a jury.\u201d Liberty Oil Co., 260 U.S. at \n\n34 \n \n242 (citations omitted). This equity-first order of oper-\nations was laid out by this Court over 100 years ago:  \nThe same order is preserved as under the sys-\ntem of separate courts. If a defendant at law \nhad an equitable defense, he resorted to a bill \nin equity to enjoin the suit at law, until he \ncould make his equitable defense effective by \na hearing before the chancellor. The hearing \non that bill was before the chancellor, and not \nbefore a jury, and, if the prayer of the bill was \ngranted, the injunction against the suit at law \nwas made perpetual, and no jury trial ensued. \nIf the injunction was denied, the suit at law \nproceeded to verdict and judgment. This was \nthe practice in the courts of law and chancery \nin England when our Constitution and the \nSeventh Amendment were adopted, and it is \nin the light of such practice that the Seventh \nAmendment is to be construed. \nId. at 243.  \n* * * \nIn sum, exhaustion was not part of the common \nlaw in 1791, and it has its origins in equity. This his-\ntorical background, along with exhaustion\u2019s func-\ntional similarities to forum-based equitable defenses \nsuch as adequate remedy at law, forum non conven-\niens, abstention, and habeas bars\u2014all historically \nnon-jury issues\u2014leads to the conclusion that the Sev-\nenth Amendment does not require juries to try ex-\nhaustion inquiries.  \n\n35 \n \n4. Functional considerations demon-\nstrate that judges, not juries, should \ndetermine exhaustion questions.  \nEven if history did not provide a clear answer, this \nCourt can, as a last resort, \u201clook elsewhere\u201d\u2015including \nat \u201cstatutory policies\u201d and the respective skills of \njudges and juries\u2015to inform the proper allocation be-\ntween a court or jury for purposes of the Seventh \nAmendment. Markman, 517 U.S. at 384; see also Del \nMonte Dunes, 526 U.S. at 718 (citation omitted). \nBeginning with the statutory policies at issue, the \nPLRA\u2019s statutory history is well documented. \u201cCon-\ngress enacted the [PLRA] . . . in 1996 in the wake of a \nsharp rise in prisoner litigation in the federal courts.\u201d \nWoodford, 548 U.S. at 84 (citing Alexander, 159 F.3d \nat 1324\u201325). The statute thus contains a variety of \ngatekeeping provisions \u201cdesigned to bring this litiga-\ntion under control.\u201d Id. (citations omitted). A \u201ccenter-\npiece\u201d of this effort is the PLRA\u2019s exhaustion require-\nment. Id. (citation omitted). \nThe PLRA\u2019s exhaustion requirement was, \u201cbeyond \ndoubt,\u201d \u201cenacted . . . to reduce the quantity and im-\nprove the quality of prisoner suits[.]\u201d Porter, 534 U.S. \nat 524. To this end, the provision \u201cafford[s] corrections \nofficials time and opportunity to address complaints \ninternally before allowing the initiation of a federal \ncase.\u201d Id. at 525 (emphasis added); see also Woodford, \n548 U.S. at 93 (\u201cThe PLRA attempts to eliminate un-\nwarranted federal-court interference with the admin-\nistration of prisons . . . .\u201d). This might \u201cobviat[e] the \nneed for litigation\u201d in some instances, or it might \u201cfil-\nter out some frivolous claims.\u201d Porter, 534 U.S. at 525 \n(citing Booth, 532 U.S. at 737). For cases that do make \n\n36 \n \nit to court, \u201cadjudication could be facilitated by an ad-\nministrative record that clarifies the contours of the \ncontroversy.\u201d Id. (citing Booth, 532 U.S. at 737); see \nalso Woodford, 548 U.S. at 95 (\u201cWhen a grievance is \nfiled shortly after the event giving rise to the griev-\nance, witnesses can be identified and questioned while \nmemories are still fresh, and evidence can be gathered \nand preserved.\u201d). These goals mirror the purposes of \ntraditional administrative exhaustion\u2014they safe-\nguard \u201cadministrative agency authority and pro-\nmot[e] judicial efficiency.\u201d McCarthy, 503 U.S. at 145.  \nThese goals would be severely undercut if a court \nwere to permit an exhaustion question to go to the \njury. Prison officials would be denied the opportunity \nto address and potentially rectify complaints inter-\nnally. Unexhausted claims could proceed to discovery \nwithout the benefits of full administrative record. \nMost critically, exhaustion questions would require ei-\nther a mini-jury trial before the merits adjudication or \na jury trial heard simultaneously with the merits. In \neither scenario, judicial resources and jurors\u2019 time \nwould be expended on claims that should never have \nreached the courthouse doors. Such a result directly \ncontradicts the PLRA\u2019s aims. \nOn the second point, judges\u2019 established role as \ngatekeepers in prisoner lawsuits supports the conclu-\nsion that judges, not juries, are \u201cbetter suited\u201d to as-\ncertain a prisoner\u2019s compliance with the exhaustion \nrequirement. See Markman, 517 U.S. at 384, 388\u201389 \n(consulting \u201cexisting precedent\u201d and considering \u201cthe \nrelative interpretive skills of judges and juries\u201d); Del \nMonte Dunes, 526 U.S. at 720 (looking to \u201cconsidera-\ntions of process and function\u201d). As explained in Part \n\n37 \n \nI(A), judges routinely resolve threshold issues and act \nas gatekeepers on factual questions that would other-\nwise be presented to the jury. This is especially true \nin PLRA cases, where, due to the sheer volume of pris-\noner lawsuits, Alexander, 159 F.3d at 1324, judges are \nwell-acquainted with the internal operations of prison \nsystems and their multi-level grievance processes. \nThe screening requirement of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A rein-\nforces this notion, as judges already ensure compli-\nance with other aspects of the PLRA. This knowledge \nbase has well prepared the judiciary to settle ques-\ntions surrounding exhaustion under the PLRA. \nThese considerations provide sufficient reason to \ntreat the disposition of questions of fact concerning ex-\nhaustion like many other factfinding responsibilities \nceded to judges in the normal course of litigation.  \nII. The Seventh Amendment does not preserve \nthe right to a jury trial on factual questions \nconcerning exhaustion even when those fac-\ntual questions are intertwined with the un-\nderlying merits. \nAt common law, the Seventh Amendment did not \npreserve the right to a jury trial on equitable defenses \nsuch as exhaustion. Following the merger of the courts \nof law and equity in 1938, however, courts have recog-\nnized that \u201c[d]ifficulties may arise . . . when the legal \nand equitable issues overlap and the evidence is inter-\ntwined.\u201d Danjaq LLC v. Sony Corp., 263 F.3d 942, 962 \n(9th Cir. 2001); Ross v. Bernhard, 396 U.S. 531, 536\u2013\n39 (1970). This Court has held that, as a prudential \nmatter, where factual issues overlap between legal \nand equitable issues, jury-triable issues should \n\n38 \n \ngenerally be prioritized. See, e.g., Beacon Theatres, \n359 U.S. at 510\u201311; Dairy Queen, Inc. v. Wood, 369 \nU.S. 469, 472\u201373 (1962).  \nBut exhaustion remains a threshold precondition \nto suit that, by its nature, must be determined before \nthe merits. With that that order of operation in mind, \nthis Court has applied the Beacon Theatres principle \nonly where an equitable claim could, through collat-\neral estoppel or res judicata, bar a subsequent jury \ntrial on a legal claim. Exhaustion does not present \nsuch a circumstance. And, in any event, this Court has \nconsidered departure from the Beacon Theatres pru-\ndential rule when it would undercut congressional in-\ntent, as it would here. For these reasons, Richards \ndoes not have a jury trial right on factual questions \nconcerning exhaustion\u2014even when those questions \nare intertwined with the merits of his claims.  \nA. Beacon Theatres created a presumption \nthat juries should decide intertwined le-\ngal and equitable issues, but that pre-\nsumption does not apply here.  \nBeacon Theatres stands for the proposition that, \nwhere legal and equitable claims are grounded in the \nsame set of facts, the right to a jury trial on the legal \nclaims should prevail, precluding a prior determina-\ntion of the equitable claims. This \u201cgeneral prudential \nrule,\u201d Parklane Hosiery, 439 U.S. at 334, is primarily \nconcerned with the collateral estoppel or res judicata \neffect that an inverse ordering would present, id. See \nalso Katchen v. Landy, 382 U.S. 323, 339\u201340 (1966) \n(explaining that Beacon Theatres announced an \u201cequi-\ntable doctrine,\u201d not a bright-line rule). Consequently, \n\n39 \n \nall order-of-trial problems should, \u201cwherever possi-\nble,\u201d be resolved in favor of granting a jury trial to pre-\nserve the Seventh Amendment right. Beacon Thea-\ntres, 359 U.S. at 510. The resolution of an exhaustion \nquestion, however, does not present such a scenario.  \nBeacon Theatres involved a dispute between two \ntheatres regarding the validity of contracts in which \nthe film distributors had given one of the theatres, \nFox, the exclusive right to show \u201cfirst run pictures\u201d in \nthe area. Id. at 502. Because another theatre, Beacon, \n\u201cnotified Fox that it considered [the] contracts . . . to \nbe overt acts in violation of antitrust laws,\u201d id., Fox \nfiled suit seeking both declaratory judgment and an \ninjunction against Beacon asserting an antitrust \nclaim against it. Id. at 502\u201303. Beacon then filed a \ncounterclaim and cross-claim that the contracts vio-\nlated antitrust laws and requested treble damages. Id. \nat 503. Despite an issue of common fact among the \ncomplaint and counterclaim and Beacon\u2019s request for \na jury trial on legal issues, the district court ordered \nFox\u2019s claims, which were traditional suits in equity, to \nbe tried by the court before a determination of Bea-\ncon\u2019s claims. Id. at 503\u201304. The court of appeals af-\nfirmed, holding that the district judge could try the \nequitable claim first, even if it might preclude a jury \ntrial on the legal claims. Id. at 505.  \nThis Court disagreed. Reasoning that trying the \nequitable claims first could, by way of collateral estop-\npel or res judicata, bar a subsequent trial on the mer-\nits of Beacon\u2019s legal claims, the Court held that order-\nof-trial problems be resolved in favor of granting a \njury trial unless there are \u201cimperative circumstances, \ncircumstances which in view of the flexible procedures \n\n40 \n \nof the Federal Rules we cannot now anticipate.\u201d Id. at \n508; see id. at 504 (\u201c[I]f Beacon would have been enti-\ntled to a jury trial in a treble damage suit against Fox, \nit cannot be deprived of the right merely because Fox \ntook advantage of the availability of declaratory relief \nto sue Beacon first.\u201d); see also Parklane Hosiery, 439 \nU.S. at 333 (\u201cRecognition that an equitable determi-\nnation could have collateral-estoppel effect in a subse-\nquent legal action was the major premise of . . . Beacon \nTheatres.\u201d).  \nDairy Queen, decided three years later, involved \nsimilar timing concerns. There, the claims were both \nlegal (monetary damages for breach of contract) and \nequitable (relief in the form of injunction), and the dis-\ntrict court denied the defendants\u2019 demand for a jury \ntrial on the ground that the jury claim was only \u201cinci-\ndental\u201d to the non-jury claim. 369 U.S. at 470. This \nCourt, relying on Beacon Theatres, explained that \u201cthe \nright to trial by jury may [not] be lost as to legal issues \nwhere those are characterized as \u2018incidental\u2019 to equi-\ntable issues.\u201d Id. Again, the Court was concerned with \nthe preclusive effect that a determination on equitable \nissues would have on legal ones. Id. at 472\u201373. \nBeacon Theatres is therefore instructive in deter-\nmining the order of trial on merits-based arguments. \nWhere a party has a right to a jury trial on a legal \nclaim, the order of trial should be arranged to preserve \nthat right. This is consistent with \u201c[t]he limitation im-\nposed by the [Seventh] [A]mendment . . . that the ul-\ntimate determination of issues of fact by the jury be \nnot interfered with.\u201d In re Peterson, 253 U.S. at 310 \n(emphasis added); see also Markman, 517 U.S. at 377 \n(asking \u201cwhether a particular issue . . . is itself \n\n41 \n \nnecessarily a jury issue, the guarantee being essential \nto preserve the right to a jury\u2019s resolution of the ulti-\nmate dispute\u201d). \nExhaustion questions, whether intertwined with \nthe merits or not, do not raise the same concerns as \nthose in Beacon Theatres for two interrelated reasons. \nFirst, unlike the substantive claims in Beacon Thea-\ntres, exhaustion is a threshold precondition to reach-\ning the merits. Second, unlike the concerns of collat-\neral estoppel or res judicata in Beacon Theatres, a \njudge\u2019s factual findings on exhaustion would not pre-\nclude a jury\u2019s ability to consider those same facts when \ndetermining the merits of the legal claim.  \n1. The presumption does not apply be-\ncause exhaustion is a threshold issue \nthat is logically precedent to the mer-\nits.  \nBeacon Theatres involved competing causes of ac-\ntion\u2014claims for declaratory and injunctive relief on \nthe one hand and claims for treble damages on the \nother. Under the historical equity-first order of opera-\ntions, see Liberty Oil Co., 260 U.S. at 242, the latter \nmerits claims would have been bound by the determi-\nnation of the former and thus never tried before a jury. \nThis Court held that this would violate the Seventh \nAmendment.  \nNo such scenario is present here. Unlike the \nclaims at issue in Beacon Theatres, exhaustion is a \nthreshold precondition to suit that, by its nature, \nmust be determined before the merits. Given that it is \na rule of \u201corderly\u201d procedure, Sing Tuck, 194 U.S. at \n\n42 \n \n168, \u201c[u]ntil the issue of exhaustion is resolved, a \ncourt cannot know whether it is to decide the case or \nthe prison authorities are to,\u201d Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741. \nSee also Perez v. Wis. Dep\u2019t of Corr., 182 F.3d 532, 534 \n(7th Cir. 1999) (explaining that exhaustion is \u201cde-\nsigned to prevent [a] decision on the merits\u201d). To do \notherwise would flip exhaustion on its head\u2014defer-\nence to agency authority would be bypassed and judi-\ncial efficiency lost. See McCarthy, 503 U.S. at 145; Pe-\nrez, 182 F.3d at 534 (explaining that \u201c[e]xamining the \nmerits first and then ordering a case dismissed on ex-\nhaustion grounds . . . would disregard the statutory \napproach\u201d).  \nBecause exhaustion is a threshold issue, it does \nnot have any bearing on a prisoner\u2019s jury trial right. \nIndeed, \u201c \u2018[t]he Seventh Amendment does not confer \nthe right to a trial, but only the right to have a jury \nhear the case once it is determined that the litigation \nshould proceed before a court.\u2019 \u201d Caley, 428 F.3d at \n1372 (quoting Am. Heritage Life Ins. Co., 294 F.3d at \n711); see also Sydnor v. Conseco Fin. Serv. Corp., 252 \nF.3d 302, 307 (4th Cir. 2001) (same). In contrast to \nBeacon Theatres, in which there were competing equi-\ntable and legal causes of action, exhaustion presents \na threshold precondition to suit. Legal claims that are \nsubject to trial by jury may be tried by that jury only \nafter determination of the threshold issue. Beacon \nTheatres is therefore distinguishable and does not \ncompel a different result.  \n\n43 \n \n2. The presumption does not apply be-\ncause a judge\u2019s factual findings re-\ngarding exhaustion would not pre-\nclude a jury\u2019s consideration of the \nsame facts when determining the \nmerits of the legal claim.  \nThis case differs from Beacon Theatres for a sec-\nond reason. A jury can reexamine factual determina-\ntion made by a judge regarding exhaustion when de-\nciding the merits of the claim.  \nBoth Beacon Theatres and Dairy Queen involved \ncircumstances in which the right to a jury trial on a \nlegal issue would be lost through the determination of \nan equitable issue. And Beacon Theatres itself recog-\nnized that there would be cases in which a trial court \nhas \u201cdiscretion in deciding whether the legal or equi-\ntable cause should be tried first,\u201d 359 U.S. at 510, \nkeeping in mind that this discretion \u201cmust, wherever \npossible, be exercised to preserve jury trial.\u201d Id. See \nalso Markman, 517 U.S. at 377 (asking whether the \njury must hear this question to \u201cpreserve the \u2018sub-\nstance of the common-law right of trial by jury\u2019 \u201d) \n(quoting Tull, 481 U.S. at 426) (emphasis omitted). \nHere, that right can be preserved through a jury\u2019s \nability to reexamine the fact questions common to ex-\nhaustion and the underlying legal claim at trial. As \nexplained in Pavey:  \n[A]ny finding that the judge makes, relating \nto exhaustion, that might affect the merits \nmay be reexamined by the jury if\u2014and only \nafter\u2014the prisoner overcomes the exhaustion \ndefense and the case proceeds to the merits. \n544 F.3d at 742.  \n\n44 \n \nThis approach is consistent with the \u201cflexible\u201d na-\nture of collateral estoppel. Duvall v. Att\u2019y Gen. of the \nUnited States, 436 F.3d 382, 390 (3d Cir. 2006) \n(\u201cCourts and commentators have consistently recog-\nnized that collateral estoppel was borne of equity and \nis therefore \u2018flexible,\u2019 bending to satisfy its underlying \npurpose in light of the nature of the proceedings.\u201d) (ci-\ntation omitted); United States v. Stauffer Chem. Co., \n464 U.S. 165, 176 (1984) (White, J., concurring) (ex-\nplaining that collateral estoppel \u201cis a flexible, judge-\nmade doctrine\u201d). Cf. Parklane Hosiery, 439 U.S. at 331 \n(explaining that trial courts have \u201cbroad discretion\u201d in \ndetermining \nwhen \noffensive \ncollateral \nestoppel \n\u201cshould be applied\u201d). \nPavey\u2019s pragmatic approach disposes of the pri-\nmary concern at issue in Beacon Theatres and Dairy \nQueen\u2014namely, that the \u201cright to a jury trial of legal \nissues [would] be lost through prior determination of \nequitable claims.\u201d 359 U.S. at 511 (citation omitted). \nFollowing Pavey\u2019s approach, \u201c[i]f and when the judge \ndetermines that the prisoner has properly exhausted \nhis administrative remedies, the case will proceed to \npretrial discovery, and if necessary a trial, on the mer-\nits[.]\u201d 544 F.3d at 742; see also id. at 741 (explaining \nthat \u201cin many cases the only consequence of a failure \nto exhaust is that the prisoner must go back to the \nbottom rung of the administrative ladder\u201d).4 Then, \u201cif \nthere is a jury trial, the jury will make all necessary \nfindings of fact without being bound by (or even \n \n4 This approach also allays the concerns in Fireman\u2019s Fund, \nwhich the Sixth Circuit relied on below, that \u201cthe merits of a con-\ntroversy could be summarily decided\u201d \u201cwithout the ordinary inci-\ndents of trial.\u201d 253 F.2d at 784 (citing Smithers v. Smith, 204 \nU.S. 632, 645 (1907)).  \n\n45 \n \ninformed of) any of the findings made by the district \njudge in determining that the prisoner had exhausted \nhis administrative remedies.\u201d5 Id. In short, the \u201csub-\nstance of the common-law right of trial by jury\u201d is pre-\nserved. Colgrove, 413 U.S. at 156.  \nOf course, some prisoners will be unable to refile \ntheir lawsuit after a judge\u2019s determination that they \nfailed to properly exhaust administrative remedies. \nSee Pavey, 544 F.3d at 742 (explaining that where a \njudge decides that \u201cthe failure to exhaust was the pris-\noner\u2019s fault . . . the case is over\u201d). But this is simply a \nconsequence of the exhaustion requirement function-\ning as intended. See, e.g., Woodford, 548 U.S. at 89\u2013\n92 (discussing the purposes of exhaustion); id. at 95 \n(\u201cA prisoner who does not want to participate in the \nprison grievance system will have little incentive to \ncomply with the system\u2019s procedural rules unless non-\ncompliance carries a sanction.\u201d). And again, this con-\nsequence has no bearing on the Seventh Amendment, \nwhich guarantees a jury trial only after it is deter-\nmined that the case belongs in court.  \n \n5 As recognized in Pavey, the ability of a prisoner to refile a case \nafter proper exhaustion \u201cdistinguishes the issue of exhaustion \nfrom [other] deadline lines issues that juries decide.\u201d Id. at 741. \nFor example, \u201c[a] statute of limitations defense if successfully in-\nterposed ends the litigation rather than shunting it to another \nforum.\u201d Id.; see also Messa, 652 F.3d at 309\u201310 (explaining that \nthe doctrines of exhaustion and statutes of limitations \u201cplay . . . \nimportant\u2014and distinct\u2014roles in our system of justice\u201d) (cita-\ntion omitted).  \n\n46 \n \nB. Unlike in Beacon Theatres, a judicial de-\ntermination of exhaustion would imple-\nment congressional intent.  \nEven assuming Beacon Theatres applies generally \nto threshold issues that would not implicate the jury\u2019s \nultimate determination of the merits, its presumption \nshould not apply in the PLRA exhaustion context.  \nPost-Beacon Theatres, this Court has noted the \nlimitations of its order-of-trial presumption. In \nKatchen, for example, the Court explained that \u201c[b]oth \nBeacon Theatres and Dairy Queen recognize that \nthere might be situations in which the Courts could \nproceed to resolve the equitable claims first even \nthough the results might be dispositive of the issues \ninvolved in the legal claim.\u201d 382 U.S. at 339 (emphasis \nadded). The Katchen Court addressed \u201cthe mode of \nprocedure for trying out the issue\u201d of voidable prefer-\nences against an estate in bankruptcy proceedings. \n382 U.S. at 325, 326. Recognizing the equitable juris-\ndiction of bankruptcy courts and the \u201cspecific statu-\ntory scheme contemplating the prompt trial of a dis-\nputed claim but without the intervention of a jury,\u201d \nthis Court permitted a bankruptcy court to decide the \npreference issues in an equitable proceeding notwith-\nstanding the argument that it would \u201crender unneces-\nsary a trial in a [legal] action.\u201d Id. at 336, 339. The \nCourt rejected the petitioner\u2019s reliance on Beacon The-\natres and Dairy Queen, noting that the rule of those \ncases \u201cis itself an equitable doctrine\u201d and that appli-\ncation of the rule would \u201cdismember a scheme which \nCongress has prescribed.\u201d Id. at 339; see also id. at \n339\u201340 (\u201cBoth Beacon Theatres and Dairy Queen rec-\nognize that there might be situations in which the \nCourt could proceed to resolve the equitable claim \n\n47 \n \nfirst even though the results might be dispositive of \nthe issues involved in the legal claim.\u201d); but see Gran-\nfinanciera, 492 U.S. at 58\u201359 (noting the limitations \non the scope of Congress\u2019s ability to \u201cdivest [parties] of \ntheir Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial\u201d).  \nAs in Katchen, this case involves a specific statu-\ntory scheme whose purpose would be compromised ab-\nsent prompt resolution of disputed facts by the court. \nSee Katchen, 383 U.S. at 339. Congress passed the \nPLRA \u201cto reduce the quantity and improve the quality \nof prisoner suits.\u201d Porter, 534 U.S. at 524. The \u201cinvig-\norated\u201d exhaustion requirements is the \u201ccenterpiece\u201d \nof this legislation, Woodford, 548 U.S. at 84, and it \nserves dual purposes. It allows prisons to rectify their \nown mistakes before they are \u201chaled into federal \ncourt,\u201d id. at 89, and promotes judicial efficiency by \nreducing litigation and creating an administrative \nrecord for the litigation that does occur, id. \nAllowing potentially unexhausted claims to pro-\nceed to a jury trial subverts both purposes. See also \nPart I(B)(4). This subversion is further reason why the \nprudential rule set forth in Beacon Theatres should \nnot apply to PLRA exhaustion.  \nThat an exhaustion question is intertwined with \nthe merits of a prisoner\u2019s claim does not transform ex-\nhaustion into a jury-triable issue. Exhaustion is a \nthreshold issue that is logically precedent to the mer-\nits. And Beacon Theatres\u2019 presumption would not ap-\nply where any judicial determination of overlapping \nfacts remains subject to later review by a jury in a trial \non the merits. Finally, that a judicial determination of  \n \n \n\n48 \n \nexhaustion would implement congressional intent \nserves as yet another reason why Beacon Theatres\u2019 \nprudential rule should not apply to exhaustion ques-\ntions. \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be  \nreversed.  \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nAnn M.

Because he \nalleges that their retaliation included destroying his \nprison grievances and preventing him from utilizing \nthe grievance process, the question of whether he \nfailed to exhaust available administrative remedies \nis inextricably intertwined with the core merits of \nhis claim. This is a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim for money \ndamages, so the Seventh Amendment clearly gives \nMr. Richards a right to jury trial on the merits of his \nclaims.  Nonetheless, the magistrate judge conducted \na bench trial, heard evidence from both sides, found \nas a fact that the testimony of Respondent and his \nco-plaintiffs was not credible, and recommended \ndismissal on the ground that they failed to exhaust \navailable \nprison \nremedies. \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt \naccepted that recommendation. \n \nThe Sixth Circuit correctly held that this process \nviolated \nthe \nSeventh \nAmendment, \ngiven \nthe \nsubstantial overlap between the factual disputes \nrelated to exhaustion and the actual merits of \nRichards\u2019 claims. In so doing, and as the petition \nexplains, the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision created an \nacknowledged circuit split with the Seventh Circuit\u2019s \ndecision in Pavey v. Conley, 544 F.3d 739 (7th Cir. \n2008). The en banc Ninth Circuit has also endorsed \nthe relevant holding of Pavey in Albino v. Baca, 747 \nF.3d 1162, 1171 (9th Cir. 2014) (en banc), though the \nSixth Circuit characterized the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \nlanguage as dicta. Pet. App. 14a. On the other side of \n\n2 \n \n \nthe equation, several district courts in the Second \nCircuit have like, the Sixth Circuit, disagreed with \nPavey.  \n \nNonetheless, review of this shallow split would \nbe premature. The Sixth Circuit is clearly right\u2014\nand the Seventh and Ninth Circuits clearly wrong\u2014\non the Seventh Amendment question. Indeed, there \nare strong arguments that the Seventh Amendment \ndoes not permit judicial resolution of facts related to \nexhaustion \neven \nwhen \nthose \nfacts \nare \nnot \nintertwined with the merits. When the facts are \nintertwined, it is black-letter law that judges should \ndefer to juries even as to facts (like amount-in-\ncontroversy) that also bear on subject matter \njurisdiction. Several circuits that generally permit \njudge resolution of exhaustion questions have \nreserved decision on whether a different rule might \nbe necessary when those facts are intertwined with \nthe merits. There is every reason to expect that \nthose circuits will ultimately side with the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s cogent analysis in this case and reject the \nSeventh Circuit\u2019s puzzling and illogical Pavey \ndecision. Indeed the Seventh and Ninth Circuits may \nwell reconsider the question en banc without this \nCourt\u2019s intervention. \n \nThe petition argues at length that convening a \njury to decide factual disputes bearing on exhaustion \nof remedies would defeat Congress\u2019s intent to \nstreamline \nprisoner \nlitigation \nin \nthe \nPrison \nLitigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d). It says time and \nagain that early bench trial resolution of exhaustion \nquestions is necessary to bar \u201cfrivolous claims at the \nearliest possible juncture.\u201d  Pet. at 2; see also id. at 9, \n16. But the PLRA\u2019s actual pre-screening provision, \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, notably does not provide for such \n\n3 \n \n \na procedure. The Sixth Circuit here also ruled that \nRichards\u2019 \u201cserious and detailed allegations cannot \nreasonably be considered frivolous,\u201d Pet. App. 8a, \nand observed that the defendant did \u201cnot directly \ncontest whether his alleged actions were motivated \nby Richards\u2019s protected conduct.\u201d  96 F.4th at 918\u2013\n19.  The petition challenges neither ruling.   \n \nThis Court has repeatedly rejected arguments \nlike these suggesting that the PLRA sets up \nexhaustion as some kind of special and jurisdictional \nprecondition to suit. See, e.g., Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. \n199, 216 (2007) (\u201cfailure to exhaust is an affirmative \ndefense under the PLRA\u201d); see also Woodford v. Ngo, \n548 U.S. 81, 101 (2006) (concluding that \u201cthe PLRA \nexhaustion requirement is not jurisdictional\u201d). The \nproblem of intertwined exhaustion and merits \nfactual disputes also is presented only in a subset of \nPLRA cases.  And in any event the question is not \nwhether jury resolution of disputed facts can be \nsquared with a statute\u2019s purpose, but rather whether \nthat statute\u2019s application can be squared with the \nConstitution. As this Court has repeatedly made \nclear, questions about Congress\u2019s intent must take a \nback-seat to the historic role of the jury at common \nlaw. Yet Michigan would hand Congress the keys to \nthe car and strap the Seventh Amendment to the \nroof. This Court should decline that invitation. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n4 \n \n \nI. THE \nSIXTH \nCIRCUIT\u2019S \nDECISION \nIS \n \nCLEARLY CORRECT \n \nA. \nThe \nSixth \nCircuit \nCorrectly \nRecognized That Facts Intertwined \nWith The Merits Should Always Be \nDecided By Juries  \n \nThe petition argues that a factual dispute about \nexhaustion is just a \u201cthreshold issue to determine \nwhether \na \nprisoner \nhas \nmet \na \nprocedural \nrequirement to take his or her case to a jury,\u201d and \nthat therefore the Seventh Amendment is not \nimplicated by analogy to other threshold issues like \nabstention and venue. Pet. 19. These arguments \nmirror Judge Posner\u2019s \u201cgeneralization\u201d in Pavey that \n\u201c[j]uries decide cases, not issues of judicial traffic \ncontrol.\u201d 544 F.3d at 741. But they bear little \nresemblance to an actual Seventh Amendment \nanalysis. \n \nUnder this Court\u2019s precedents, \u00a7 1983\u2014the \nfoundation of Richards\u2019s action\u2014is clearly analogous \nto causes of action that were \u201ctried at law at the time \nof the founding.\u201d Markman v. Westview Instruments, \nInc., 517 U.S. 370, 376 (1996); City of Monterey v. Del \nMonte Dunes at Monterey, Ltd., 526 U.S. 687, 718 \n(1999). So the precise Seventh Amendment question \nis \u201cwhether the particular trial decision,\u201d a factual \ndispute about exhaustion that overlaps with the \nmerits, \u201cmust fall to the jury in order to preserve the \nsubstance of the common-law right as it existed in \n1791.\u201d Markman, 517 U.S. at 376. To figure that out, \n\u201cwe look to history to determine whether the \nparticular issues, or analogous ones, were decided by \njudge or by jury in suits at common law at the time \n\n5 \n \n \nthe Seventh Amendment was adopted.\u201d Del Monte \nDunes, 526 U.S. at 718. And \u201cwhere history does not \nprovide a clear answer, we look to precedent and \nfunctional considerations.\u201d Id. \nThe Sixth Circuit rightly acknowledged that \nunder this Court\u2019s precedents \u201c\u2018many procedural \ndevices developed since 1791 that have diminished the \ncivil jury\u2019s historic domain,\u2019\u201d such as directed verdicts \nand summary judgment, \u201c\u2018have been found not to be \ninconsistent with the Seventh Amendment.\u2019\u201d Pet. App. \n16a-17a (quoting Parklane Hosiery Co., Inc. v. Shore, \n439 U.S. 322, 336 (1979)). But it then recognized the \nkey distinction between those devices and what \nhappened here: none of them \u201cpermit a judge to decide \ngenuine disputes of material fact at a preliminary \nstage of the case that would normally be reserved for \nthe jury.\u201d Pet. App. 17a. The magistrate judge\u2019s \nfactfinding in this case\u2014including explicit credibility \ndeterminations\u2014directly invaded the merits and \n\u201cstripped [Richards] of his \u2018right to a jury\u2019s resolution \nof the ultimate dispute.\u2019\u201d Pet. App. 17a (quoting \nMarkman, 517 U.S. at 377).  \nTo buttress the point, the Sixth Circuit cited its \nlongstanding holding that factual disputes about the \namount in controversy should be deferred to the jury \non the merits in diversity cases, even though that \nissue also has implications for subject matter \njurisdiction. See Pet. App. 17a-18a; Fireman\u2019s Fund \nInsurance Co v. Railway Express Agency, 253 F.2d \n780 (6th Cir. 1958). Because \u201cFireman\u2019s Fund \nrequires that certain cases be heard and determined \non the merits even when constitutionally implicated \njurisdictional disputes might procedurally terminate \nthe proceedings,\u201d the court explained, \u201cwe are all the \nmore convinced that the result should be the same \n\n6 \n \n \nwhen the lesser concern of an affirmative defense, \nsuch as the PLRA\u2019s requirement to exhaust \nadministrative remedies, implicates the merits of a \nclaim.\u201d Pet. App. 19a. After all, \u201c[u]nlike exhaustion, \nan absence of subject-matter jurisdiction implicates \na federal court\u2019s ability to even hear the case.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 19a. Fireman\u2019s Fund also explains why its \nholding is not inconsistent with the general rule that \njudges ordinarily are allowed to hear evidence and to \ndetermine facts necessary to the court\u2019s jurisdiction: \n\u201csuch hearings usually involve factual issues \npertaining only to the question of jurisdiction, not \nincluding factual issues which would be decisive of \nthe merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claim.\u201d 253 F.2d at 784. \nThe petition criticizes the Sixth Circuit\u2019s reliance \non Fireman\u2019s Fund on the ground that \u201cthe case did \nnot discuss or rely on the Seventh Amendment.\u201d Pet. \n20. That is only superficially true. Fireman\u2019s Fund \nrelied on this Court\u2019s decision in Smithers v. Smith, \n204 U.S. 632 (1907), which similarly held that a \ndispute about amount in controversy should be \ndeferred to a jury trial when that issue is intertwined \nwith the merits. And Smithers clearly does rely on \nSeventh Amendment principles, at least in part. This \nCourt explained that judicial discretion to find \njurisdictional facts \u201cobviously is not unlimited, . . . lest \nunder the guise of determining jurisdiction, the merits \nof the controversy between the parties be summarily \ndecided without the ordinary incidents of a trial, \nincluding the right to a jury.\u201d 204 U.S. at 645 \n(emphasis added). \u201cFor it must not be forgotten,\u201d this \nCourt wrote, \u201cthat where, in good faith, one has \nbrought into court a cause of action which, as stated \nby him, is clearly within its jurisdiction, he has the \nright to try its merits in the manner provided by the \n\n7 \n \n \nConstitution and law, and cannot be compelled to \nsubmit to a trial of another kind.\u201d Id. \nFireman\u2019s Fund also relied on this Court\u2019s \nopinion in Land v. Dollar, 330 U.S. 731 (1947), \nwhich considered a suit by a steamship company\u2019s \nstockholders against the U.S. Maritime Commission \nto recover stock previously given to the Commission. \nThis Court held that the district court erred in \ndeciding a jurisdictional sovereign immunity question, \nbecause \u201cthis is the type of case where the question of \njurisdiction is dependent on decision of the merits.\u201d \n330 U.S. at 735. \u201c[I]f the allegations of the petition \n[were] true, the shares of stock never were property of \nthe United States,\u201d so the district court had \n\u201cjurisdiction to determine its jurisdiction\u201d and should \ninstead have \u201cproceed[ed] to a decision on the merits.\u201d \nId. at 738\u201339. Land v. Dollar does not explicitly \ninvoke the right to jury trial, but the principles it \nrelied on are plainly intended to protect that right. \nIt is longstanding black letter law that \u201c[i]n a case \nin which there is a right to jury trial, a dismissal for \nlack of jurisdiction that improperly summarily decides \nthe substantive issues also violates the parties\u2019 \nSeventh Amendment rights.\u201d 8 Moore\u2019s Federal \nPractice \u00a7 38.34[1][c][i] (3d ed. 2009) (\u201cTrial on Merits \nRequired \nWhen \nJurisdictional \nDetermination \nDepends on Determination of Merits.\u201d).1 Factual \n                                                 \n1 See also 5C Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \n\u00a7 1350 (3d ed. 2004) (\u201cThe court may postpone a decision until \nevidence is submitted at trial if the jurisdictional issue is \nintertwined with the merits of the case.\u201d); Joshua S. Moskovitz, \nNote, The Usual Practice: Raising and Deciding Failure to \nExhaust Administrative Remedies as an Affirmative Defense \nunder the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 31 Cardozo L. Rev. 1859, \n1899 n.248 (2010) (Moskovitz) (collecting sources).  \n\n8 \n \n \nquestions bearing on both personal jurisdiction and \nvenue are also reserved for trial and submitted to the \njury when they are intertwined with the core merits of \nthe case.2 And in the related context of civil actions \npresenting both legal and equitable claims, this Court \nhas consistently held that the jury trial right cannot \n\u201cbe impaired by any blending with a claim, properly \ncognizable at law, of a demand for equitable relief in \naid of the legal action, or during its pendency.\u201d Scott v. \nNeely, 140 U.S. 106, 109\u201310 (1891); see also Ross v. \nBernhard, 396 U.S. 531, 537\u201338, 538 n.10 (1970) \n(\u201c[W]here equitable and legal claims are joined in the \nsame action, [the] right to jury trial on the legal \nclaims . . . must not be infringed.\u201d). \nThe rule that factual issues bearing on the merits \nmust always be decided by a jury has very deep roots. \nAt common law, defendants could dispute a plaintiff\u2019s \ndeclaration (i.e., complaint) by either demurrer or \nplea. John Jay McKelvey, Principles of Common-Law \nPleading \u00a7 93, at 68\u201369 (1894) (McKelvey). A \ndemurrer, like a modern-day 12(b)(6) or purely legal \n12(b)(1) motion, accepted the facts as alleged and \n\u201craise[d] a question of law for the determination of the \ncourt\u201d about the declaration\u2019s sufficiency. Benjamin J. \n                                                 \n2 See, e.g., Brown v. Slenker, 220 F.3d 411, 419 (5th Cir. 2000) \n(\u201c[Personal j]urisdiction remains intertwined with the merits, and \non remand both must be decided at a new trial, based on valid \njury findings.\u201d); Kierulff Assocs. v. Luria Bros. & Co., 240 F. Supp. \n640, 642 (S.D.N.Y. 1965) (\u201cWhere venue and the merits of an \naction are intertwined, it is often better to wait until trial where a \nfull presentation of the issue can be made, rather than rule \npreliminarily on a motion.\u201d); Fastener Corp. v. Spotnails, Inc., 291 \nF. Supp. 974, 976 (N.D. Ill. 1968) (\u201c[T]he venue question merge[d] \nwith the issue of infringement on the merits . . . .\u201d).  \n\n9 \n \n \nShipman, Handbook of Common-Law Pleading \u00a7\u00a7 8\u20139, \nat 28 (3d ed. 1923) (Shipman).  \nAs an alternative to the demurrer, there were \nvarious types of pleas. The plea in traverse denied the \ndeclaration\u2019s factual allegations and triggered a jury \ntrial. \u201cWhere an allegation is traversed, or denied, it is \nevident that a question is at once raised between the \nparties; and it is a question of fact . . . .\u201d Shipman \n\u00a7 167, at 302; see also Richard Ross Perry, Common-\nLaw Pleading: Its History and Principles 179\u201380 \n(1897) (Perry). \u201c[T]he tender and acceptance of an \nissue of fact close[d] all pleading in the action, as there \n[was] then nothing left but a trial, which [disposed] of \nthe action on its merits.\u201d Shipman \u00a7 15, at 32\u201333.  \nThe common law permitted various other types of \npleas\u2014such as a plea in abatement or plea in bar\u2014\nthat might raise legal or factual issues collateral to \nthe merits. But critically, if any such plea actually \ncontradicted the factual allegations of the plaintiff\u2019s \ndeclaration, the common law would have regarded it \nas a traverse and proceeded immediately to a trial by \njury. \u201cThe word traverse . . . is synonymous with the \nword denial. Where the defendant intends to rely for \nhis defense upon the fact that the allegations \ncontained in the declaration as to the subject matter of \nthe action are untrue, he must put in the plea known \nas a traverse.\u201d McKelvey \u00a7 185, at 118; see also Perry, \nat 275. Therefore in a case (like this one) where the \nfacts relevant to a threshold defect were intertwined \nwith the merits, it would not even have been possible \nto frame the issue for a purely judicial decision at \ncommon law. \nThe petition argues that a bench trial before a \nmagistrate judge gave Mr. Richards many of the other \nimportant protections of a trial, such as a right to \n\n10 \n \n \npresent \nevidence \nand \ncross \nexamine \nopposing \nwitnesses. Pet. 20-21. No doubt those rights are \nimportant. But the right to trial by jury in civil cases \nis separately and specially protected by the Seventh \nAmendment. This Court recently recognized that \n\u201cthe right to trial by jury is \u2018of such importance and \noccupies so firm a place in our history and \njurisprudence that any seeming curtailment of the \nright has always been and \u2018should be scrutinized \nwith the utmost case.\u2019\u201d SEC v. Jarkesy, Slip Op. at 7 \n(2024) (quoting Dimick v. Schiedt, 293 U.S. 474, 486 \n(1935)). And that is by no means a newfound \nsentiment: Justice Story once explained that the civil \njury trial right is \u201cjustly dear to the American \npeople. It has always been an object of deep interest \nand solicitude, and every encroachment upon it has \nbeen watched with great jealousy.\u201d Parsons v. \nBedford, Breedlove & Robeson, 28 U.S. 433, 466 \n(1830). The Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision is entirely \nconsistent with that tradition. \n \n \nB. \nThe Seventh Circuit\u2019s Decision In \n \nPavey Makes No Sense  \nThe Seventh and Ninth Circuit decisions, by \ncontrast, do not genuinely grapple with the Seventh \nAmendment problem and clearly get the answer \nwrong.  \nJudge Posner\u2019s opinion in Pavey takes for \ngranted that questions of subject matter jurisdiction \n\u201coften . . . turn[] on factual issues that may be \ngenuinely debatable, but even if so the issues are \nresolved by the judge,\u201d without recognizing that an \nopposite rule applies when jurisdictional facts are \nintertwined with the merits. Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741. \nThe Pavey opinion then leaps from the observation \n\n11 \n \n \nthat judges sometimes are permitted to decide \nquestions of fact relevant to preliminary threshold \nissues to an entirely unwarranted \u201cgeneralization\u201d \nthat juries do not decide any questions that can be \ncharacterized as matters of \u201cjudicial traffic control.\u201d \nId.  \nIn reaching that conclusion, Pavey wrongly \ncharacterizes exhaustion as just an issue of \u201cjudicial \ntraffic control\u201d on the naked assertion that \u201cin many \ncases\u201d exhaustion is simply a question of the choice \nof forum because \u201cthe only consequence of a failure \nto exhaust is that the prisoner must go back to the \nbottom rung of the administrative ladder.\u201d Id. \u201cThat \ndistinguishes the issue of exhaustion from deadline \nissues that juries decide,\u201d the Seventh Circuit \nreasoned, because \u201c[a] statute of limitations defense \nif successfully interposed ends the litigation rather \nthan shunting it to another forum.\u201d The Seventh \nCircuit acknowledged, however, that in that actual \ncase the defendant \u201cwould no longer have any \nadministrative remedies\u201d if the exhaustion issue was \nresolved against him, so the issue was entirely \ndispositive of the merits. Id. Surely this Court \nunderstands that that will almost always be true in \nPLRA cases. Prisons have grievance and appeal \nprocesses with extremely tight filing windows\u2014\nmeasured in days. By the time an exhaustion issue \nis raised in federal court, those deadlines will \ngenerally be years in the past and will make it \nimpossible for the plaintiff to go back and seek \nfurther exhaustion. See Alison M. Mikkor, Correcting \nfor Bias and Blind Spots in PLRA Exhaustion Law, \n21 George Mason L. Rev. 573, 584 (2014) (\u201cIn the \nlast few years, many corrections departments have \nalso reduced the amount of time within which a \n\n12 \n \n \nprisoner must file her initial grievance and any \nsubsequent appeals.  In the light of the deference \nshown to [these internal] rules in the PLRA \nexhaustion analysis, this reduction means that for \nprisoners in some systems there is effectively only a \ntwo- or three-day statute of limitations on their \nconstitutional claims.\u201d) (footnotes omitted).   \nFinally, the Seventh Circuit reasoned that, \u201c[b]y \nanalogy to the cases that require that claims at law \nbe decided before equitable claims when both types \nof claim are presented,\u201d a jury later hearing the case \non the merits would not be bound by any exhaustion \nfindings the judge made. Id. at 742. But as the Sixth \nCircuit correctly explained, that line of reasoning \n\u201crings hollow\u201d because \u201cif the prisoner\u2019s case is \ndismissed for failure to exhaust his or her \nadministrative remedies\u201d then \u201ca jury would never \nbe assembled to resolve the factual disputes\u201d on the \nmerits. Pet. App. 15a. \nIn Albino v. Baca, the en banc Ninth Circuit \nappeared to embrace Pavey, with the court noting \nthat \u201c[w]e agree with the Seventh Circuit that, if a \nfactual finding on a disputed question is relevant \nboth to exhaustion and to the merits, a judge\u2019s \nfinding made in the course of deciding exhaustion is \nnot binding on a jury deciding the merits of the suit.\u201d \n747 F.3d\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Rev. 1859 (2010) ...................... 7, 15, 16 \n \nRichard Ross Perry, Common-Law Pleading: Its \nHistory and Principles (1897) ............................... 9, 17 \n \n\n1 \n \n \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE WRIT \n \n \nRespondent Kyle Brandon Richards filed this \ncivil rights lawsuit alleging, among other things, \nthat \nMichigan \ncorrectional \nofficers \nsexually \nassaulted him and retaliated against him for \nexercising his First Amendment rights. Because he \nalleges that their retaliation included destroying his \nprison grievances and preventing him from utilizing \nthe grievance process, the question of whether he \nfailed to exhaust available administrative remedies \nis inextricably intertwined with the core merits of \nhis claim. This is a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim for money \ndamages, so the Seventh Amendment clearly gives \nMr. Richards a right to jury trial on the merits of his \nclaims.  Nonetheless, the magistrate judge conducted \na bench trial, heard evidence from both sides, found \nas a fact that the testimony of Respondent and his \nco-plaintiffs was not credible, and recommended \ndismissal on the ground that they failed to exhaust \navailable \nprison \nremedies. \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt \naccepted that recommendation. \n \nThe Sixth Circuit correctly held that this process \nviolated \nthe \nSeventh \nAmendment, \ngiven \nthe \nsubstantial overlap between the factual disputes \nrelated to exhaustion and the actual merits of \nRichards\u2019 claims. In so doing, and as the petition \nexplains, the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision created an \nacknowledged circuit split with the Seventh Circuit\u2019s \ndecision in Pavey v. Conley, 544 F.3d 739 (7th Cir. \n2008). The en banc Ninth Circuit has also endorsed \nthe relevant holding of Pavey in Albino v. Baca, 747 \nF.3d 1162, 1171 (9th Cir. 2014) (en banc), though the \nSixth Circuit characterized the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \nlanguage as dicta. Pet. App. 14a. On the other side of \n\n2 \n \n \nthe equation, several district courts in the Second \nCircuit have like, the Sixth Circuit, disagreed with \nPavey.  \n \nNonetheless, review of this shallow split would \nbe premature. The Sixth Circuit is clearly right\u2014\nand the Seventh and Ninth Circuits clearly wrong\u2014\non the Seventh Amendment question. Indeed, there \nare strong arguments that the Seventh Amendment \ndoes not permit judicial resolution of facts related to \nexhaustion \neven \nwhen \nthose \nfacts \nare \nnot \nintertwined with the merits. When the facts are \nintertwined, it is black-letter law that judges should \ndefer to juries even as to facts (like amount-in-\ncontroversy) that also bear on subject matter \njurisdiction. Several circuits that generally permit \njudge resolution of exhaustion questions have \nreserved decision on whether a different rule might \nbe necessary when those facts are intertwined with \nthe merits. There is every reason to expect that \nthose circuits will ultimately side with the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s cogent analysis in this case and reject the \nSeventh Circuit\u2019s puzzling and illogical Pavey \ndecision. Indeed the Seventh and Ninth Circuits may \nwell reconsider the question en banc without this \nCourt\u2019s intervention. \n \nThe petition argues at length that convening a \njury to decide factual disputes bearing on exhaustion \nof remedies would defeat Congress\u2019s intent to \nstreamline \nprisoner \nlitigation \nin \nthe \nPrison \nLitigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d). It says time and \nagain that early bench trial resolution of exhaustion \nquestions is necessary to bar \u201cfrivolous claims at the \nearliest possible juncture.\u201d  Pet. at 2; see also id. at 9, \n16. But the PLRA\u2019s actual pre-screening provision, \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, notably does not provide for such \n\n3 \n \n \na procedure. The Sixth Circuit here also ruled that \nRichards\u2019 \u201cserious and detailed allegations cannot \nreasonably be considered frivolous,\u201d Pet. App. 8a, \nand observed that the defendant did \u201cnot directly \ncontest whether his alleged actions were motivated \nby Richards\u2019s protected conduct.\u201d  96 F.4th at 918\u2013\n19.  The petition challenges neither ruling.   \n \nThis Court has repeatedly rejected arguments \nlike these suggesting that the PLRA sets up \nexhaustion as some kind of special and jurisdictional \nprecondition to suit. See, e.g., Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. \n199, 216 (2007) (\u201cfailure to exhaust is an affirmative \ndefense under the PLRA\u201d); see also Woodford v. Ngo, \n548 U.S. 81, 101 (2006) (concluding that \u201cthe PLRA \nexhaustion requirement is not jurisdictional\u201d). The \nproblem of intertwined exhaustion and merits \nfactual disputes also is presented only in a subset of \nPLRA cases.  And in any event the question is not \nwhether jury resolution of disputed facts can be \nsquared with a statute\u2019s purpose, but rather whether \nthat statute\u2019s application can be squared with the \nConstitution. As this Court has repeatedly made \nclear, questions about Congress\u2019s intent must take a \nback-seat to the historic role of the jury at common \nlaw. Yet Michigan would hand Congress the keys to \nthe car and strap the Seventh Amendment to the \nroof. This Court should decline that invitation. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n4 \n \n \nI. THE \nSIXTH \nCIRCUIT\u2019S \nDECISION \nIS \n \nCLEARLY CORRECT \n \nA. \nThe \nSixth \nCircuit \nCorrectly \nRecognized That Facts Intertwined \nWith The Merits Should Always Be \nDecided By Juries  \n \nThe petition argues that a factual dispute about \nexhaustion is just a \u201cthreshold issue to determine \nwhether \na \nprisoner \nhas \nmet \na \nprocedural \nrequirement to take his or her case to a jury,\u201d and \nthat therefore the Seventh Amendment is not \nimplicated by analogy to other threshold issues like \nabstention and venue. Pet. 19. These arguments \nmirror Judge Posner\u2019s \u201cgeneralization\u201d in Pavey that \n\u201c[j]uries decide cases, not issues of judicial traffic \ncontrol.\u201d 544 F.3d at 741. But they bear little \nresemblance to an actual Seventh Amendment \nanalysis. \n \nUnder this Court\u2019s precedents, \u00a7 1983\u2014the \nfoundation of Richards\u2019s action\u2014is clearly analogous \nto causes of action that were \u201ctried at law at the time \nof the founding.\u201d Markman v. Westview Instruments, \nInc., 517 U.S. 370, 376 (1996); City of Monterey v. Del \nMonte Dunes at Monterey, Ltd., 526 U.S. 687, 718 \n(1999). So the precise Seventh Amendment question \nis \u201cwhether the particular trial decision,\u201d a factual \ndispute about exhaustion that overlaps with the \nmerits, \u201cmust fall to the jury in order to preserve the \nsubstance of the common-law right as it existed in \n1791.\u201d Markman, 517 U.S. at 376. To figure that out, \n\u201cwe look to history to determine whether the \nparticular issues, or analogous ones, were decided by \njudge or by jury in suits at common law at the time \n\n5 \n \n \nthe Seventh Amendment was adopted.\u201d Del Monte \nDunes, 526 U.S. at 718. And \u201cwhere history does not \nprovide a clear answer, we look to precedent and \nfunctional considerations.\u201d Id. \nThe Sixth Circuit rightly acknowledged that \nunder this Court\u2019s precedents \u201c\u2018many procedural \ndevices developed since 1791 that have diminished the \ncivil jury\u2019s historic domain,\u2019\u201d such as directed verdicts \nand summary judgment, \u201c\u2018have been found not to be \ninconsistent with the Seventh Amendment.\u2019\u201d Pet. App. \n16a-17a (quoting Parklane Hosiery Co., Inc. v. Shore, \n439 U.S. 322, 336 (1979)). But it then recognized the \nkey distinction between those devices and what \nhappened here: none of them \u201cpermit a judge to decide \ngenuine disputes of material fact at a preliminary \nstage of the case that would normally be reserved for \nthe jury.\u201d Pet. App. 17a. The magistrate judge\u2019s \nfactfinding in this case\u2014including explicit credibility \ndeterminations\u2014directly invaded the merits and \n\u201cstripped [Richards] of his \u2018right to a jury\u2019s resolution \nof the ultimate dispute.\u2019\u201d Pet. App. 17a (quoting \nMarkman, 517 U.S. at 377).  \nTo buttress the point, the Sixth Circuit cited its \nlongstanding holding that factual disputes about the \namount in controversy should be deferred to the jury \non the merits in diversity cases, even though that \nissue also has implications for subject matter \njurisdiction. See Pet. App. 17a-18a; Fireman\u2019s Fund \nInsurance Co v. Railway Express Agency, 253 F.2d \n780 (6th Cir. 1958). Because \u201cFireman\u2019s Fund \nrequires that certain cases be heard and determined \non the merits even when constitutionally implicated \njurisdictional disputes might procedurally terminate \nthe proceedings,\u201d the court explained, \u201cwe are all the \nmore convinced that the result should be the same \n\n6 \n \n \nwhen the lesser concern of an affirmative defense, \nsuch as the PLRA\u2019s requirement to exhaust \nadministrative remedies, implicates the merits of a \nclaim.\u201d Pet. App. 19a. After all, \u201c[u]nlike exhaustion, \nan absence of subject-matter jurisdiction implicates \na federal court\u2019s ability to even hear the case.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 19a. Fireman\u2019s Fund also explains why its \nholding is not inconsistent with the general rule that \njudges ordinarily are allowed to hear evidence and to \ndetermine facts necessary to the court\u2019s jurisdiction: \n\u201csuch hearings usually involve factual issues \npertaining only to the question of jurisdiction, not \nincluding factual issues which would be decisive of \nthe merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claim.\u201d 253 F.2d at 784. \nThe petition criticizes the Sixth Circuit\u2019s reliance \non Fireman\u2019s Fund on the ground that \u201cthe case did \nnot discuss or rely on the Seventh Amendment.\u201d Pet. \n20. That is only superficially true. Fireman\u2019s Fund \nrelied on this Court\u2019s decision in Smithers v. Smith, \n204 U.S. 632 (1907), which similarly held that a \ndispute about amount in controversy should be \ndeferred to a jury trial when that issue is intertwined \nwith the merits. And Smithers clearly does rely on \nSeventh Amendment principles, at least in part. This \nCourt explained that judicial discretion to find \njurisdictional facts \u201cobviously is not unlimited, . . . lest \nunder the guise of determining jurisdiction, the merits \nof the controversy between the parties be summarily \ndecided without the ordinary incidents of a trial, \nincluding the right to a jury.\u201d 204 U.S. at 645 \n(emphasis added). \u201cFor it must not be forgotten,\u201d this \nCourt wrote, \u201cthat where, in good faith, one has \nbrought into court a cause of action which, as stated \nby him, is clearly within its jurisdiction, he has the \nright to try its merits in the manner provided by the \n\n7 \n \n \nConstitution and law, and cannot be compelled to \nsubmit to a trial of another kind.\u201d Id. \nFireman\u2019s Fund also relied on this Court\u2019s \nopinion in Land v. Dollar, 330 U.S. 731 (1947), \nwhich considered a suit by a steamship company\u2019s \nstockholders against the U.S. Maritime Commission \nto recover stock previously given to the Commission. \nThis Court held that the district court erred in \ndeciding a jurisdictional sovereign immunity question, \nbecause \u201cthis is the type of case where the question of \njurisdiction is dependent on decision of the merits.\u201d \n330 U.S. at 735. \u201c[I]f the allegations of the petition \n[were] true, the shares of stock never were property of \nthe United States,\u201d so the district court had \n\u201cjurisdiction to determine its jurisdiction\u201d and should \ninstead have \u201cproceed[ed] to a decision on the merits.\u201d \nId. at 738\u201339. Land v. Dollar does not explicitly \ninvoke the right to jury trial, but the principles it \nrelied on are plainly intended to protect that right. \nIt is longstanding black letter law that \u201c[i]n a case \nin which there is a right to jury trial, a dismissal for \nlack of jurisdiction that improperly summarily decides \nthe substantive issues also violates the parties\u2019 \nSeventh Amendment rights.\u201d 8 Moore\u2019s Federal \nPractice \u00a7 38.34[1][c][i] (3d ed. 2009) (\u201cTrial on Merits \nRequired \nWhen \nJurisdictional \nDetermination \nDepends on Determination of Merits.\u201d).1 Factual \n                                                 \n1 See also 5C Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \n\u00a7 1350 (3d ed. 2004) (\u201cThe court may postpone a decision until \nevidence is submitted at trial if the jurisdictional issue is \nintertwined with the merits of the case.\u201d); Joshua S. Moskovitz, \nNote, The Usual Practice: Raising and Deciding Failure to \nExhaust Administrative Remedies as an Affirmative Defense \nunder the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 31 Cardozo L. Rev. 1859, \n1899 n.248 (2010) (Moskovitz) (collecting sources).  \n\n8 \n \n \nquestions bearing on both personal jurisdiction and \nvenue are also reserved for trial and submitted to the \njury when they are intertwined with the core merits of \nthe case.2 And in the related context of civil actions \npresenting both legal and equitable claims, this Court \nhas consistently held that the jury trial right cannot \n\u201cbe impaired by any blending with a claim, properly \ncognizable at law, of a demand for equitable relief in \naid of the legal action, or during its pendency.\u201d Scott v. \nNeely, 140 U.S. 106, 109\u201310 (1891); see also Ross v. \nBernhard, 396 U.S. 531, 537\u201338, 538 n.10 (1970) \n(\u201c[W]here equitable and legal claims are joined in the \nsame action, [the] right to jury trial on the legal \nclaims . . . must not be infringed.\u201d). \nThe rule that factual issues bearing on the merits \nmust always be decided by a jury has very deep roots. \nAt common law, defendants could dispute a plaintiff\u2019s \ndeclaration (i.e., complaint) by either demurrer or \nplea. John Jay McKelvey, Principles of Common-Law \nPleading \u00a7 93, at 68\u201369 (1894) (McKelvey). A \ndemurrer, like a modern-day 12(b)(6) or purely legal \n12(b)(1) motion, accepted the facts as alleged and \n\u201craise[d] a question of law for the determination of the \ncourt\u201d about the declaration\u2019s sufficiency. Benjamin J. \n                                                 \n2 See, e.g., Brown v. Slenker, 220 F.3d 411, 419 (5th Cir. 2000) \n(\u201c[Personal j]urisdiction remains intertwined with the merits, and \non remand both must be decided at a new trial, based on valid \njury findings.\u201d); Kierulff Assocs. v. Luria Bros. & Co., 240 F. Supp. \n640, 642 (S.D.N.Y. 1965) (\u201cWhere venue and the merits of an \naction are intertwined, it is often better to wait until trial where a \nfull presentation of the issue can be made, rather than rule \npreliminarily on a motion.\u201d); Fastener Corp. v. Spotnails, Inc., 291 \nF. Supp. 974, 976 (N.D. Ill. 1968) (\u201c[T]he venue question merge[d] \nwith the issue of infringement on the merits . . . .\u201d).  \n\n9 \n \n \nShipman, Handbook of Common-Law Pleading \u00a7\u00a7 8\u20139, \nat 28 (3d ed. 1923) (Shipman).  \nAs an alternative to the demurrer, there were \nvarious types of pleas. The plea in traverse denied the \ndeclaration\u2019s factual allegations and triggered a jury \ntrial. \u201cWhere an allegation is traversed, or denied, it is \nevident that a question is at once raised between the \nparties; and it is a question of fact . . . .\u201d Shipman \n\u00a7 167, at 302; see also Richard Ross Perry, Common-\nLaw Pleading: Its History and Principles 179\u201380 \n(1897) (Perry). \u201c[T]he tender and acceptance of an \nissue of fact close[d] all pleading in the action, as there \n[was] then nothing left but a trial, which [disposed] of \nthe action on its merits.\u201d Shipman \u00a7 15, at 32\u201333.  \nThe common law permitted various other types of \npleas\u2014such as a plea in abatement or plea in bar\u2014\nthat might raise legal or factual issues collateral to \nthe merits. But critically, if any such plea actually \ncontradicted the factual allegations of the plaintiff\u2019s \ndeclaration, the common law would have regarded it \nas a traverse and proceeded immediately to a trial by \njury. \u201cThe word traverse . . . is synonymous with the \nword denial. Where the defendant intends to rely for \nhis defense upon the fact that the allegations \ncontained in the declaration as to the subject matter of \nthe action are untrue, he must put in the plea known \nas a traverse.\u201d McKelvey \u00a7 185, at 118; see also Perry, \nat 275. Therefore in a case (like this one) where the \nfacts relevant to a threshold defect were intertwined \nwith the merits, it would not even have been possible \nto frame the issue for a purely judicial decision at \ncommon law. \nThe petition argues that a bench trial before a \nmagistrate judge gave Mr. Richards many of the other \nimportant protections of a trial, such as a right to \n\n10 \n \n \npresent \nevidence \nand \ncross \nexamine \nopposing \nwitnesses. Pet. 20-21. No doubt those rights are \nimportant. But the right to trial by jury in civil cases \nis separately and specially protected by the Seventh \nAmendment. This Court recently recognized that \n\u201cthe right to trial by jury is \u2018of such importance and \noccupies so firm a place in our history and \njurisprudence that any seeming curtailment of the \nright has always been and \u2018should be scrutinized \nwith the utmost case.\u2019\u201d SEC v. Jarkesy, Slip Op. at 7 \n(2024) (quoting Dimick v. Schiedt, 293 U.S. 474, 486 \n(1935)). And that is by no means a newfound \nsentiment: Justice Story once explained that the civil \njury trial right is \u201cjustly dear to the American \npeople. It has always been an object of deep interest \nand solicitude, and every encroachment upon it has \nbeen watched with great jealousy.\u201d Parsons v. \nBedford, Breedlove & Robeson, 28 U.S. 433, 466 \n(1830). The Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision is entirely \nconsistent with that tradition. \n \n \nB. \nThe Seventh Circuit\u2019s Decision In \n \nPavey Makes No Sense  \nThe Seventh and Ninth Circuit decisions, by \ncontrast, do not genuinely grapple with the Seventh \nAmendment problem and clearly get the answer \nwrong.  \nJudge Posner\u2019s opinion in Pavey takes for \ngranted that questions of subject matter jurisdiction \n\u201coften . . . turn[] on factual issues that may be \ngenuinely debatable, but even if so the issues are \nresolved by the judge,\u201d without recognizing that an \nopposite rule applies when jurisdictional facts are \nintertwined with the merits. Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741. \nThe Pavey opinion then leaps from the observation \n\n11 \n \n \nthat judges sometimes are permitted to decide \nquestions of fact relevant to preliminary threshold \nissues to an entirely unwarranted \u201cgeneralization\u201d \nthat juries do not decide any questions that can be \ncharacterized as matters of \u201cjudicial traffic control.\u201d \nId.  \nIn reaching that conclusion, Pavey wrongly \ncharacterizes exhaustion as just an issue of \u201cjudicial \ntraffic control\u201d on the naked assertion that \u201cin many \ncases\u201d exhaustion is simply a question of the choice \nof forum because \u201cthe only consequence of a failure \nto exhaust is that the prisoner must go back to the \nbottom rung of the administrative ladder.\u201d Id. \u201cThat \ndistinguishes the issue of exhaustion from deadline \nissues that juries decide,\u201d the Seventh Circuit \nreasoned, because \u201c[a] statute of limitations defense \nif successfully interposed ends the litigation rather \nthan shunting it to another forum.\u201d The Seventh \nCircuit acknowledged, however, that in that actual \ncase the defendant \u201cwould no longer have any \nadministrative remedies\u201d if the exhaustion issue was \nresolved against him, so the issue was entirely \ndispositive of the merits. Id. Surely this Court \nunderstands that that will almost always be true in \nPLRA cases. Prisons have grievance and appeal \nprocesses with extremely tight filing windows\u2014\nmeasured in days. By the time an exhaustion issue \nis raised in federal court, those deadlines will \ngenerally be years in the past and will make it \nimpossible for the plaintiff to go back and seek \nfurther exhaustion. See Alison M. Mikkor, Correcting \nfor Bias and Blind Spots in PLRA Exhaustion Law, \n21 George Mason L. Rev. 573, 584 (2014) (\u201cIn the \nlast few years, many corrections departments have \nalso reduced the amount of time within which a \n\n12 \n \n \nprisoner must file her initial grievance and any \nsubsequent appeals.  In the light of the deference \nshown to [these internal] rules in the PLRA \nexhaustion analysis, this reduction means that for \nprisoners in some systems there is effectively only a \ntwo- or three-day statute of limitations on their \nconstitutional claims.\u201d) (footnotes omitted).   \nFinally, the Seventh Circuit reasoned that, \u201c[b]y \nanalogy to the cases that require that claims at law \nbe decided before equitable claims when both types \nof claim are presented,\u201d a jury later hearing the case \non the merits would not be bound by any exhaustion \nfindings the judge made. Id. at 742. But as the Sixth \nCircuit correctly explained, that line of reasoning \n\u201crings hollow\u201d because \u201cif the prisoner\u2019s case is \ndismissed for failure to exhaust his or her \nadministrative remedies\u201d then \u201ca jury would never \nbe assembled to resolve the factual disputes\u201d on the \nmerits. Pet. App. 15a. \nIn Albino v. Baca, the en banc Ninth Circuit \nappeared to embrace Pavey, with the court noting \nthat \u201c[w]e agree with the Seventh Circuit that, if a \nfactual finding on a disputed question is relevant \nboth to exhaustion and to the merits, a judge\u2019s \nfinding made in the course of deciding exhaustion is \nnot binding on a jury deciding the merits of the suit.\u201d \n747 F.3d at 1171. But the claims at issue in Albino \ndid not actually implicate the underlying merits, and \nelsewhere in its opinion the Ninth Circuit used less \ndefinitive language:  \u201cExhaustion should be decided, \nif feasible, before reaching the merits of a prisoner's \nclaim.\u201d  Id. (emphasis added); see also id. (\u201cWe \nreiterate that, if feasible, disputed factual questions \nrelevant to exhaustion should be decided at the very \nbeginning of the litigation.\u201d). Now that the Sixth \n\n13 \n \n \nCircuit has explained the flaws in the Seventh \nCircuit\u2019s reasoning it seems unlikely that other \ncircuits will follow along. Indeed, there is reason to \nhope that the Seventh and Ninth Circuits will \nreconsider their position en banc without a need for \nthis Court\u2019s intervention.  \nThis \nCourt \nalso \nmay \nbenefit \nfrom \nmore \npercolation. Among the courts of appeals, only the \nSixth and Seventh Circuits have addressed the issue \npresented head-on. Several district courts in the \nSecond Circuit have parted ways with Pavey. Other \ncircuits have identified the problem as well and will \nalmost certainly in due course wrestle with it more \nfully. See Small v. Camden County, 728 F.3d 265, \n270 (3d Cir. 2013) (\u201c[T]he Seventh Amendment is not \nimplicated as long as the facts are not bound up with \nthe merits of the underlying dispute.\u201d); Messa v. \nGoord, 652 F.3d 305, 309 (2d Cir. 2011) (\u201c[T]he \nfactual disputes relating to exhaustion are not \nintertwined with the merits . . . .\u201d); Dillon v. Rogers, \n596 F.3d 260, 272 n.2 (5th Cir. 2010) (\u201cWe do not \ndetermine today who should serve as factfinder \nwhen facts concerning exhaustion also go to the \nmerits of a prisoner\u2019s claim.\u201d). And, given the \nfavorable decision in the Sixth Circuit, prisoners will \nbe more likely to raise the issue going forward. \n \nC. \nExhaustion \nFacts \nShould \nBe \nDecided By Juries Even When They \nAre Not Intertwined With The \nMerits \n \nThe Sixth Circuit decided this case against the \nbackdrop of its own precedent holding that facts \nrelated to exhaustion can be resolved by judges when \n\n14 \n \n \nthey are not intertwined with the merits. That \nassumption is widely shared by the lower courts. \nAlthough it is not necessary to reach the issue in this \ncase, the Court should understand that that \nassumption is probably wrong. The reason goes back \nto the issue the Seventh Circuit failed to wrestle \nwith in Pavey: that a finding of non-exhaustion in \nthe PLRA context will almost always bar the claim \nforever. \nRecall that at common law a defendant who \ncould not or chose not to demur could either file a \ntraverse or a plea. There were a variety of pleas, but \nthe most common were \u201cpleas in abatement\u201d and \n\u201cpleas in bar.\u201d The plea in abatement was one of the \n\u201cdilatory pleas,\u201d which raised a class of common law \ndefenses that merely \u201cdelay[ed] the plaintiff\u2019s action \ninstead of dealing with the merits of his claim.\u201d \nGeorge L. Clark, Common Law Pleading \u00a7 59, at 131 \n(1931) (Clark); McKelvey \u00a7 132, at 93 (\u201cJudgment \nupon the dilatory plea was not final, . . . it did not \ndetermine the case upon the merits.\u201d).3 A plea in \nabatement, if successful, \u201cdispose[d] of the particular \nsuit\u201d but allowed the plaintiff to \u201ccommence anew \nupon the same cause of action in the same court\u201d so \nlong as the plaintiff avoided the mistake that caused \nthe original abating. McKelvey \u00a7 131, at 92. Typically, \na plea in abatement related to the parties\u2019 identities, a \nmisnomer in the declaration of facts, or a defect in the \n                                                 \n3 The other dilatory pleas were pleas to the jurisdiction and pleas \nin suspension of the action. Clark \u00a7 59, at 132. Pleas to the \njurisdiction attacked a court\u2019s subject matter or personal \njurisdiction, disposing of the case entirely before that court if \nsuccessful. McKelvey \u00a7\u00a7 131, 134, at 92, 95. Pleas in suspension of \nthe action sought to identify the plaintiff\u2019s temporary incapacity \nto bring suit. Id. \u00a7 131, at 92; Clark \u00a7 60, at 134; Shipman \u00a7 230, \nat 400. \n\n15 \n \n \nplaintiff\u2019s writ. Id. \u00a7\u00a7 134\u2013135, at 95; Moskovitz, at \n1885. Defects in the plaintiff\u2019s writ included \u201cwrong \nvenue,\u201d that the \u201caction was brought prematurely,\u201d \nthat \u201cthe same claim was pending in another court,\u201d \nthat \u201cthe parties were misnamed,\u201d or that \u201ca \nnecessary party was not joined or . . . was misjoined.\u201d \nMoskovitz, at 1885.  \nMany lower courts have broadly analogized \nexhaustion of administrative remedies to the old \nplea in abatement, and held that there is no Seventh \nAmendment right to jury factfinding because \nsupposedly factual disputes relevant to a plea in \nabatement were resolved by judges. See, e.g., Bryant \nv. Rich, 530 F.3d 1368, 1374 (11th Cir. 2008) \n(\u201cExhaustion of administrative remedies is a matter \nin abatement, and ordinarily does not deal with the \nmerits.\u201d (cleaned up) (quoting 5C Wright & Miller \n\u00a7 1360, at 78 n.15)); Albino, 747 F.3d at 1168. That \nassumption is actually disputed by scholars.4 \nRegardless, the analogy is wrong. The dilatory pleas \n(including abatement) \u201cdid not determine the case \nupon the merits.\u201d McKelvey \u00a7 132, at 93. A plea in \nabatement merely \u201cdelay[ed] the plaintiff\u2019s action \ninstead of dealing with the merits of his claim.\u201d Clark \n\u00a7 59, at 131. By definition, therefore, a plea in \nabatement could not present an argument that the \n                                                 \n4 Pleas in abatement typically tendered an issue of law properly \n\u201celiminated on demurrer\u201d by the judge. A.C. Umbreit, Outline \nof the Law of Common Law Pleading, 4 Marq. L. Rev. 130, 133 \n(1920). But if the plaintiff did not demur, \u201c[t]here is extensive \nhistorical support that a factual dispute on a matter in \nabatement \n[could \nalso \nbe] \ndecided \nby \nthe \njury . . . as \ndocumented in civil cases, in criminal cases, and in numerous \ntreatises.\u201d Moskovitz, at 1896 & nn.234\u201336 (collecting sources \nsupporting jury resolution of fact disputes posed by various \ndilatory pleas). \n\n16 \n \n \nplaintiff\u2019s claim was permanently barred. Matters in \nabatement \u201ccould only go so far as to defeat the \npresent action, and not to demonstrate that the \nplaintiff was permanently disabled from bringing the \nclaim.\u201d Moskovitz, at 1886. Any plea in abatement \nbased on a prematurity defect necessarily alleged that \nthe action was curably premature. See, e.g., Shipman \n\u00a7 225, at 390 n.18 (citing Grand Lodge Bhd. of R.R. \nTrainmen v. Randolph, 57 N.E. 882 (1900), as an \nexample of a plea in abatement alleging \u201cfailure to \nexhaust remedies provided in [a] contract\u201d). Again, \nhowever, in most PLRA cases the very short prison \ngrievance timelines will have expired long before suit \nso a finding of non-exhaustion will permanently bar \nthe claim. \nIn common law terms, an affirmative defense that \nwould permanently end the litigation would have been \nraised by a \u201cplea in bar,\u201d and specifically a variant \ncalled a plea \u201cin discharge.\u201d Pleas in bar could be pled \nnegatively, as a traverse denying the factual \nallegations, or affirmatively, as a confession and \navoidance admitting the facts but denying their legal \neffect by alleging new facts. Shipman \u00a7 197\u2013199, at \n348. Pleas in confession and avoidance were divided \ninto two categories: pleas in justification or excuse and \npleas in discharge. Id. Pleas in discharge included \nbankruptcy, release, payment, and the statute of \nlimitations\u2014all of which alleged that the plaintiff\u2019s \ncause of action had \u201cbeen discharged by some matter \nsubsequent, either of fact or of law.\u201d Id \u00a7 198(b), at \n348; id. \u00a7 199, at 350; cf. Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c)(1). \nLike a statute of limitations issue, an exhaustion \ndefect arises after a \u00a7 1983 claim accrues and \ntherefore is more analogous to a matter in discharge \nthan in abatement. And a judge would never have \n\n17 \n \n \ndecided disputed facts posed by a plea in discharge. If \nthe plea contained a traverse disputing the plaintiff\u2019s \nfacts, the issue was joined and a jury trial was \ntriggered. If the plea was instead framed as a \nconfession and avoidance, then the ball was in the \nplaintiff\u2019s court. See Perry, at 179\u201380, 272\u201373. The \nplaintiff could respond with his own demurrer, \naccepting the new facts alleged in avoidance but \ndenying their legal effect, which would frame up an \nissue of law for the judge. Id. Or the plaintiff could \nrespond with a traverse to the plea, joining issue on \nthe merits and triggering a trial. See id. There were \nsome other ways to procure judicial decision of a true \nquestion of law, such as the arcane concept of \u201cexpress \ncolor\u201d in trespass actions.5 As far as counsel can \ndetermine, however, a defendant could never procure \njudicial resolution of disputed facts relevant to a \ndispositive affirmative defense like exhaustion. \n \nII.  \nTHE \nPETITION \nOVERSTATES \nTHE \nSUPPOSED \nCONFLICT \nWITH \nTHE \nPLRA\u2019S PURPOSES, WHICH DO NOT \nTRUMP THE SEVENTH AMENDMENT \nIN ANY EVENT \n \nThe Seventh Circuit justified its distortion of \ntraditional jury trial principles because it thought \n\u201c[t]he alternative . . . is unsatisfactory\u201d and \u201cwould \nthwart Congress\u2019s effort to bar trials of prisoner \n                                                 \n5 See Shipman \u00a7\u00a7 200\u2013202, at 350\u201355; Perry, at 274\u201376. Even \nthen, if the issue of law was not \u201cwholly foreign to the merits of \nthe cause,\u201d Shipman \u00a7 202, at 354\u201355, and could not be \n\u201csegregate[d] . . . from the remaining matters of fact,\u201d Perry, at \n275, then the defendant could not withdraw the matter from the \njury.  \n\n18 \n \n \ncases in which the prisoner has failed to exhaust his \nadministrative remedies.\u201d Pavey, 544 F.3d at 742. \nThe petition doubles down on that position, devoting \nbarrels of ink to arguing that Congress intended to \nmake exhaustion a \u201cthreshold issue[] of judicial \nadministration,\u201d Pet. 17 (quoting Lee v. Willey, 789 \nF.3d 673, 678 (6th Cir. 2015)), to weed out frivolous \nclaims. The petition notably ignores the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s conclusion that Richards\u2019s allegations were \n\u201cserious and detailed\u201d and could not \u201creasonably be \nconsidered frivolous.\u201d Pet. App. 8a. Instead, the \npetition elects to criticizes the Sixth Circuit for \n\u201cfail[ing] \nto \ngive \ndeference\u201d \nin \nits \nSeventh \nAmendment \nanalysis \nto \nCongress\u2019s \nsupposed \nobjectives, Pet. 20. \nAll of this is both irrelevant and overstated. It is \nirrelevant because Congress\u2019s desire to reduce the \nworkload of the federal courts does not give it a free \npass to violate the Bill of Rights. If the Seventh \nAmendment protects a right to jury resolution of all \nfacts intertwined with the merits of a legal claim \n(and it does) then the Seventh Amendment controls. \nCongress has ample tools to address this perceived \nproblem without violating the jury trial right, and it \nhas used them\u2014aggressively.  \nThese concerns are overstated for a couple of \nreasons. First, in Woodford and Jones this Court has \nalready rejected the once-pervasive arguments and \nholdings that PLRA exhaustion is a jurisdictional or \nquasi-jurisdictional right not to face litigation at all, \nwhich necessarily must be resolved before anything \nelse happens in a case. Prior to Woodford and Jones, \nthe lower courts invented procedural vehicles found \nnowhere \nin \nthe \nFederal \nRules, \nsuch \nas \nthe \n\u201cunenumerated 12(b) motion,\u201d Wyatt v. Terhune, 315 \n\n19 \n \n \nF.3d 1108 (9th Cir. 2003); requiring prisoner plaintiffs \nto plead exhaustion with specificity up front; or \ndismissing entire complaints if any claim was not \nexhausted. See Jones, 549 U.S. at 203 (holding that \nthese innovations \u201cexceed[ed] the proper limits on the \njudicial role\u201d). But this Court held that exhaustion is \nan ordinary affirmative defense. See id. at 212-214. \nAffirmative defenses (all of them) must be raised by \nanswer under Rule 8(c), which places the burden of \nproof on the defendant and leaves the question to be \nresolved in the ordinary course through summary \njudgment or trial. No doubt the lower courts find those \nholdings inconvenient (or \u201cunsatisfactory,\u201d Pavey, 544 \nF.3d at 742), but they represent this Court\u2019s \nconclusion that in fact Congress did not intend to \nmake exhaustion of administrative remedies some \nkind of threshold super-requirement. When it wants \nto, Congress knows how to write jurisdictional \nstatutes, or immunity statutes like the Foreign \nSovereign Immunities Act, which create a vehicle for \nthreshold resolution of some important issue before \nanything else happens. It did not take that course in \nthe PLRA, and this Court has already said so. See id. \nat 216 (noting the conspicuous \u201cfailure of Congress to \ninclude exhaustion in terms among the enumerated \ngrounds justifying dismissal upon early screening\u201d). \nSecond, the Sixth Circuit\u2019s holding is narrow and \nthere is no reason to think it will have a dramatic \nimpact on prisoner litigation. The Sixth Circuit \n\u201cemphasize[d] that a jury trial is appropriate in \nthese circumstances only if the district court finds \nthat genuine disputes of material fact concerning \nPLRA exhaustion are decisive of the merits of the \nplaintiff\u2019s claim.\u201d Pet. App. 19a. (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). The petition argues that every \n\n20 \n \n \nprisoner suit will somehow allege exhaustion facts \nintertwined with the merits, but the ordinary rules \nof civil procedure are up to that challenge\u2014and if \nnot this Court has, \u201c[i]n a series of recent cases, . . . \nexplained that courts should generally not depart \nfrom the usual practice under the Federal Rules on \nthe basis of perceived policy concerns.\u201d See id. at \n212. The Sixth Circuit\u2019s rule has already been \napplied in district courts throughout the Second \nCircuit for more than a decade without issue. See \nPet. App. 15a-16a.  \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nThe petition should be denied.  \n \n \n \n \n \nJ.

This Court has held that judges can \ndecide facts related to threshold issues\u2014\nlike exhaustion\u2014without violating the \nSeventh Amendment. .................................. 16 \nB. The Seventh Amendment does not \npreserve the right to a jury trial on any \nfactual questions concerning exhaustion \nbecause exhaustion derives from equity. .... 19 \n\niii \n \n1. The Seventh Amendment guarantees \na jury trial right only as to issues \ntried by a jury in suits at common \nlaw at the time the Seventh \nAmendment was adopted. ..................... 20 \n2. Exhaustion did not exist at the \ncommon law, but closely analogous \nequitable issues were not decided by \njuries in 1791. ........................................ 22 \na. No historical antecedent to \nexhaustion existed at common \nlaw, but its origins are equitable \nin nature. ......................................... 23 \nb. Traditional equitable defenses \nsuch as adequate remedy at law, \nforum non conveniens, \nabstention, and habeas corpus \nbars are an appropriate common-\nlaw analog for exhaustion. .............. 27 \n3. Juries did not historically determine \nquestions of fact related to equitable \ndefenses analogous to exhaustion. ........ 33 \n4. Functional considerations \ndemonstrate that judges, not juries, \nshould determine exhaustion \nquestions. ............................................... 35 \nII. The Seventh Amendment does not preserve \nthe right to a jury trial on factual questions \nconcerning exhaustion even when those \nfactual questions are intertwined with the \nunderlying merits. .............................................. 37 \n\niv \n \nA. Beacon Theatres created a presumption \nthat juries should decide intertwined \nlegal and equitable issues, but that \npresumption does not apply here. ............... 38 \n1. The presumption does not apply \nbecause exhaustion is a threshold \nissue that is logically precedent to the \nmerits. .................................................... 41 \n2. The presumption does not apply \nbecause a judge\u2019s factual findings \nregarding exhaustion would not \npreclude a jury\u2019s consideration of the \nsame facts when determining the \nmerits of the legal claim. ....................... 43 \nB.

The \nopinion of the United States District Court for the \nWestern District of Michigan (Pet. App. 22a\u201328a) is \nnot reported but is available at 2022 WL 842654. \nJURISDICTION \nThe district court had jurisdiction over claims \nbrought by Respondent Kyle Brandon Richards under \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. The district \ncourt entered judgment for Petitioner Thomas Perttu \non March 22, 2022. Richards filed a timely notice of \nappeal by right on April 11, 2022. The court of appeals \nhad jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s final \njudgment under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. This Court has ju-\nrisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \n \n \n\n2 \n \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe Seventh Amendment to the United States \nConstitution, U.S. Const. amend. VII, provides: \nIn suits at common law, where the value in \ncontroversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the \nright of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no \nfact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-ex-\namined in any Court of the United States, \nthan according to the rules of the common law. \nThe Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a), states in applicable part: \n(a) No action shall be brought with respect to \nprison conditions under section 1983 of this ti-\ntle, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner \nconfined in any jail, prison, or other correc-\ntional facility until such administrative reme-\ndies as are available are exhausted. \nINTRODUCTION \nThe importance of the Seventh Amendment right \nto a trial by jury is well recognized. Less clear, but \nequally important, is the central principle that under-\ngirds the right: preservation of the right to a jury\u2019s ul-\ntimate determination of issues of fact where a case \nproceeds to trial. Embedded in that principle is a tacit \nlimitation\u2014the Seventh Amendment does not guar-\nantee the right to a jury trial on every fact question \nwithin a jury-triable case. Rather, the right is impli-\ncated only when a particular issue or trial decision \nmust fall to the jury to maintain the substance of the \n\n3 \n \ncommon-law right as it existed in 1791. This limita-\ntion is consistent with this Court\u2019s jurisprudence\u2014\nboth its historical view of the Seventh Amendment \nand its treatment of cases involving an overlap of legal \nand equitable issues that implicate collateral estoppel \nconcerns as opposed to cases where those concerns are \nnot present.  \nThe issue of exhaustion under the PLRA is not one \nfor a jury. Exhaustion has no precise historical analog, \nand the closest analogs are forum-based equitable de-\nfenses, which were historically decided by judges, not \nby juries.  \nThis understanding endures even where the facts \nunderlying the question of exhaustion are intertwined \nwith the merits of a prisoner\u2019s claim. In this circum-\nstance, a judge\u2019s determination as to exhaustion does \nnot impinge on the \u201csubstance\u201d of the jury trial right\u2014\nthat right remains preserved. Where the prisoner has \nproperly exhausted administrative remedies, a jury \nmay then be impaneled to find the facts concerning \nthe underlying claims and will not be bound by the \njudge\u2019s earlier factual determinations. This division of \nduties is consistent with a judge\u2019s gatekeeping role, \ncomports with the goals of the PLRA, and protects the \nright to trial by jury. \n \n \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. The PLRA Framework \nIn 1970, just over 2,000 prisoner civil rights suits \nwere filed in federal courts. Margo Schlanger, Trends \nin Prisoner Litigation, as the PLRA Approaches 20, 28 \nCorr. L. Reporter, 69, 71 (2017). Shortly after that, fil-\nings exploded. Id.  \nIn 1980, Congress took a first stab at an exhaus-\ntion provision for prisoner suits filed under \u00a7 1983. \nUnder the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons \nAct, 94 Stat. 352, as amended, district courts could \nstay a prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 1983 suit for up to 180 days while \nthe prisoner pursued \u201cplain, speedy, and effective ad-\nministrative remedies.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a)(1) (for-\nmer). The exhaustion requirement was discretionary \nthough\u2014exhaustion could be required only if the \nstate\u2019s prison grievance system met federal standards \nand if exhaustion was \u201cappropriate and in the inter-\nests of justice.\u201d \u00a7 1997e(a)(1), (2). \nBut that exhaustion provision did not stem the \ntide of prisoner litigation. By the mid-1990s, correc-\ntional systems and federal courts were overburdened \nby a mammoth caseload of prisoner litigation. In 1995 \nalone, 39,053 prisoner lawsuits were filed in federal \ncourt, a rate of 24.6 per 1,000 prisoners. Schlanger, \nTrends in Prisoner Litigation, supra, at 71. Not sur-\nprisingly, this strained the resources of the federal \ncourt system, not to mention correctional systems.  \nIn 1996, Congress enacted the PLRA \u201cin the wake \nof a sharp rise in prisoner litigation in the federal \ncourts.\u201d Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 84 (2006) \n\n5 \n \n(citing Alexander v. Hawk, 159 F.3d 1321, 1324\u201325 \n(11th Cir. 1998) (citing statistics)). A significant com-\nponent of the PLRA was a robust, mandatory exhaus-\ntion requirement. Congress \u201cinvigorated the exhaus-\ntion prescription\u201d that had existed under the prior re-\ngime, now requiring prisoners to fully exhaust all of \ntheir available administrative remedies through the \ngrievance process as a prerequisite to filing suit in fed-\neral court. Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 524 (2002).  \nAs stated by this Court, \u201cBeyond doubt, Congress \nenacted \u00a7 1997e(a) to reduce the quantity and improve \nthe quality of prisoner suits.\u201d Id. at 524. To further \nthis end, \u201cCongress afforded corrections officials time \nand opportunity to address complaints internally\u201d \nprior to prisoners seeking relief in federal court. Id. at \n525. By giving correctional officials the opportunity to \naddress grievances, \u201ccorrective action taken in re-\nsponse to an inmate\u2019s grievance might improve prison \nadministration and satisfy the inmate, thereby obvi-\nating the need for litigation.\u201d Id. (citing Booth v. \nChurner, 532 U.S. 731, 737 (2001)). In addition, a \nprison\u2019s \u201cinternal review might \u2018filter out some frivo-\nlous claims.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting Booth, 532 U.S. at 737). \nAnd the administrative record created by the prisons\u2019 \ninternal grievance processes would facilitate consider-\nation of those \u201ccases ultimately brought to court.\u201d Id. \n(citations omitted).  \nThe PLRA has been tremendously successful in \nreducing the burden on both prison officials and fed-\neral courts. From the peak of filings in 1995, within \nfive years of the passage of the PLRA prisoner law-\nsuits had fallen by 43%, even though the total prisoner \npopulation grew by 23%. Margo Schlanger, Inmate \n\n6 \n \nLitigation, 116 Harv. L. Rev. 1555, 1694 (2003). This \ndecline continued for several more years. By 2006, the \ndecline reached 60%. Margo Schlanger & Giovanna \nShay, Preserving the Rule of Law in America\u2019s Jails \nand Prisons: The Case for Amending the Prison Liti-\ngation Reform Act, 11 U. Pa. J. Const. L. 139, 141\u201342 \n(2008). Although the decline gradually plateaued, by \n2014, prisoners filed 25,324 lawsuits, a rate of 11.6 per \n1,000 prisoners. Schlanger, Trends in Prisoner Litiga-\ntion, supra, at 71. Compared to 1995, this represents \na 34% decrease in the number of prisoner lawsuits and \na 53% decline in the rate of lawsuits filed per 1,000 \nprisoners. See id. The exhaustion requirement has \nbeen a critical component of the PLRA\u2019s success.  \nB. MDOC\u2019s grievance process \nThe Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC) \nhas two separate processes for grievances. One is the \nstandard grievance procedure, governed by MDOC \nPolicy Directive 03.02.130, which is not applicable \nhere. J.A. 41\u201361. The other is the administrative pro-\ncess under the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA), \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 15601, et seq., and the Prohibited Sexual \nConduct Involving Prisoners policy (effective date \n04/24/2017), governed by MDOC Policy Directive \n03.03.140. J.A. 62\u201387.  \nThe PREA grievance procedure applies to Rich-\nards\u2019 claims of sexual abuse, harassment, and miscon-\nduct. MDOC uses a two-step process for PREA griev-\nances, both of which must be exhausted. J.A. 74\u201375. \nMDOC will not facially reject or deny grievances al-\nleging sexual abuse. J.A. 74\u201375. Instead, such \n\n7 \n \ngrievances must be investigated. J.A. 76. \u201cA prisoner \nmay file a PREA grievance at any time.\u201d J.A. 75.  \nA prisoner initiates the first step of the process by \nfiling a PREA Prisoner Grievance Form (Step I). \nJ.A. 75. Prisoners may grieve retaliation for reporting \nsexual abuse, harassment, or misconduct through the \nPREA grievance process. J.A. 72\u201373. PREA griev-\nances may not be referred to MDOC staff who are the \nsubject of the grievance. J.A. 76.  \nAt Step I, the PREA Coordinator1 must ensure \nthat \u201ca written response is provided to the prisoner \nwithin 60 calendar days of receipt of the Step I PREA \nGrievance,\u201d although an extension of up to 70 calen-\ndar days may be requested. J.A. 76\u201377. Prisoners \nmust be notified in writing of any extensions and the \ndue date for a response. J.A. 76\u201377.  \nPrisoners may appeal a Step I decision to Step II \nif they are unsatisfied with the response or the re-\nsponse was not timely. J.A. 77. MDOC\u2019s response to a \nStep II appeal is due within 90 calendar days of re-\nceipt, absent an extension, and it constitutes the final \ndecision in the matter. J.A. 77.  \nC. District Court Proceedings and Eviden-\ntiary Hearing \nRichards and co-Plaintiffs Kenneth Damon Pruitt \nand Robert Kissee filed suit under \u00a7 1983, alleging \nthat Perttu, a Resident Unit Manager (RUM) for the \nMDOC, sexually harassed them and other prisoners, \n \n1 Every prison has a PREA Coordinator designated by the war-\nden. J.A. 67.  \n\n8 \n \nretaliated against them, and destroyed their property, \nin violation of the First, Fifth, and Eighth Amend-\nments. J.A. 1\u201338. Perttu moved for summary judg-\nment, asserting that Richards and his co-Plaintiffs \nfailed to exhaust administrative remedies before filing \ntheir complaint. Pet. App. 3a. Richards and his co-\nPlaintiffs alleged that Perttu had destroyed their \ngrievances or otherwise prevented them from being \nprocessed, making the grievance process unavailable. \nPet. App. 30a, 37a, 59a\u201360a. \nThe district court denied Perttu\u2019s motion, finding \nthat there was a question of fact as to whether the \ngrievance process was available to Richards due to his \nallegation that Perttu interfered with his grievance \nfilings. Pet. App. 79a\u201381a, 83a.  \nFollowing this ruling, the magistrate judge con-\nducted an evidentiary hearing on the issue of exhaus-\ntion. J.A. 88\u2013368. Evaluating the testimony, evidence, \nand arguments presented, the magistrate judge rec-\nommended that the district court conclude that Perttu \ncarried his burden of establishing \u201cthat Plaintiffs \nfailed to exhaust any of their claims before filing suit,\u201d \nPet. App. 64a, 76a, and that the \u201cadministrative rem-\nedies were generally available\u201d to Richards and his co-\nPlaintiffs. Pet. App. 68a.  \nIn reaching that conclusion, the magistrate judge \nfound that Richards\u2019 direct examinations, which re-\nlied on leading questions, undermined the credibility \nof his witnesses. Pet. App. 69a. The magistrate judge \nthen discussed how the circumstances surrounding \nthe alleged observations of Perttu destroying griev-\nances similarly undermined Plaintiffs\u2019 credibility. Pet. \nApp. 71a\u201373a. Notably, the evidence \u201cdemonstrate[d] \n\n9 \n \nthat RUM Perttu could not, and in fact did not, inter-\ncept and destroy all grievances filed by Plaintiffs in \nthe relevant time\u201d: \n[E]ven on the dates that RUM Perttu worked, \nhe testified that he only works from 7:00am to \n3:30pm. Moreover, RUM Perttu did not work \nseven days a week every week from June 2019 \nto March 2020. Indeed, on at least one of the \ndates on which Richards alleges Perttu de-\nstroyed his grievances, January 1, 2020, \nPerttu testified that he was not working due \nto the New Years holiday. \nPet. App. 73a\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n12: 20241202140409082_23-132420Richards20PS20for20Merit20JA20A.json (score: 0.482)\nNo. 23-1324 \n \nIn the Supreme Court of the United States \n \nTHOMAS PERTTU, PETITIONER \n \nv. \n \nKYLE BRANDON RICHARDS \n \n \nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE  \nUNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT \n \n \nPROOF OF SERVICE \n \nThe undersigned certifies that on Monday, December 2, 2024, she served the \nMerits Brief, Joint Appendix, and Certificate of Compliance by e-filing and e-mailing \nsame to the email addresses provided: \n\u2022 JSCOTTBALLENGER@GMAIL.COM \n\u2022 mxc6ab@virginia.edu \n \nPaper copies will be served by Cockle Legal Briefs/Counsel Press upon: \n \nJ.

This Court has held that judges can \ndecide facts related to threshold issues\u2014\nlike exhaustion\u2014without violating the \nSeventh Amendment. .................................. 16 \nB. The Seventh Amendment does not \npreserve the right to a jury trial on any \nfactual questions concerning exhaustion \nbecause exhaustion derives from equity. .... 19 \n\niii \n \n1. The Seventh Amendment guarantees \na jury trial right only as to issues \ntried by a jury in suits at common \nlaw at the time the Seventh \nAmendment was adopted. ..................... 20 \n2. Exhaustion did not exist at the \ncommon law, but closely analogous \nequitable issues were not decided by \njuries in 1791. ........................................ 22 \na. No historical antecedent to \nexhaustion existed at common \nlaw, but its origins are equitable \nin nature. ......................................... 23 \nb. Traditional equitable defenses \nsuch as adequate remedy at law, \nforum non conveniens, \nabstention, and habeas corpus \nbars are an appropriate common-\nlaw analog for exhaustion. .............. 27 \n3. Juries did not historically determine \nquestions of fact related to equitable \ndefenses analogous to exhaustion. ........ 33 \n4. Functional considerations \ndemonstrate that judges, not juries, \nshould determine exhaustion \nquestions. ............................................... 35 \nII. The Seventh Amendment does not preserve \nthe right to a jury trial on factual questions \nconcerning exhaustion even when those \nfactual questions are intertwined with the \nunderlying merits. .............................................. 37 \n\niv \n \nA. Beacon Theatres created a presumption \nthat juries should decide intertwined \nlegal and equitable issues, but that \npresumption does not apply here. ............... 38 \n1. The presumption does not apply \nbecause exhaustion is a threshold \nissue that is logically precedent to the \nmerits. .................................................... 41 \n2. The presumption does not apply \nbecause a judge\u2019s factual findings \nregarding exhaustion would not \npreclude a jury\u2019s consideration of the \nsame facts when determining the \nmerits of the legal claim. ....................... 43 \nB. Unlike in Beacon Theatres, a judicial \ndetermination of exhaustion would \nimplement congressional intent. ................. 46 \nConclusion ................................................................. 48 \n \n\nv \n \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES \nPage \nCases \nAlbino v.

The \nopinion of the United States District Court for the \nWestern District of Michigan (Pet. App. 22a\u201328a) is \nnot reported but is available at 2022 WL 842654. \nJURISDICTION \nThe district court had jurisdiction over claims \nbrought by Respondent Kyle Brandon Richards under \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. The district \ncourt entered judgment for Petitioner Thomas Perttu \non March 22, 2022. Richards filed a timely notice of \nappeal by right on April 11, 2022. The court of appeals \nhad jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s final \njudgment under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. This Court has ju-\nrisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \n \n \n\n2 \n \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe Seventh Amendment to the United States \nConstitution, U.S. Const. amend. VII, provides: \nIn suits at common law, where the value in \ncontroversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the \nright of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no \nfact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-ex-\namined in any Court of the United States, \nthan according to the rules of the common law. \nThe Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a), states in applicable part: \n(a) No action shall be brought with respect to \nprison conditions under section 1983 of this ti-\ntle, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner \nconfined in any jail, prison, or other correc-\ntional facility until such administrative reme-\ndies as are available are exhausted. \nINTRODUCTION \nThe importance of the Seventh Amendment right \nto a trial by jury is well recognized. Less clear, but \nequally important, is the central principle that under-\ngirds the right: preservation of the right to a jury\u2019s ul-\ntimate determination of issues of fact where a case \nproceeds to trial. Embedded in that principle is a tacit \nlimitation\u2014the Seventh Amendment does not guar-\nantee the right to a jury trial on every fact question \nwithin a jury-triable case. Rather, the right is impli-\ncated only when a particular issue or trial decision \nmust fall to the jury to maintain the substance of the \n\n3 \n \ncommon-law right as it existed in 1791. This limita-\ntion is consistent with this Court\u2019s jurisprudence\u2014\nboth its historical view of the Seventh Amendment \nand its treatment of cases involving an overlap of legal \nand equitable issues that implicate collateral estoppel \nconcerns as opposed to cases where those concerns are \nnot present.  \nThe issue of exhaustion under the PLRA is not one \nfor a jury. Exhaustion has no precise historical analog, \nand the closest analogs are forum-based equitable de-\nfenses, which were historically decided by judges, not \nby juries.  \nThis understanding endures even where the facts \nunderlying the question of exhaustion are intertwined \nwith the merits of a prisoner\u2019s claim. In this circum-\nstance, a judge\u2019s determination as to exhaustion does \nnot impinge on the \u201csubstance\u201d of the jury trial right\u2014\nthat right remains preserved. Where the prisoner has \nproperly exhausted administrative remedies, a jury \nmay then be impaneled to find the facts concerning \nthe underlying claims and will not be bound by the \njudge\u2019s earlier factual determinations. This division of \nduties is consistent with a judge\u2019s gatekeeping role, \ncomports with the goals of the PLRA, and protects the \nright to trial by jury. \n \n \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. The PLRA Framework \nIn 1970, just over 2,000 prisoner civil rights suits \nwere filed in federal courts. Margo Schlanger, Trends \nin Prisoner Litigation, as the PLRA Approaches 20, 28 \nCorr. L. Reporter, 69, 71 (2017). Shortly after that, fil-\nings exploded. Id.  \nIn 1980, Congress took a first stab at an exhaus-\ntion provision for prisoner suits filed under \u00a7 1983. \nUnder the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons \nAct, 94 Stat. 352, as amended, district courts could \nstay a prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 1983 suit for up to 180 days while \nthe prisoner pursued \u201cplain, speedy, and effective ad-\nministrative remedies.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a)(1) (for-\nmer). The exhaustion requirement was discretionary \nthough\u2014exhaustion could be required only if the \nstate\u2019s prison grievance system met federal standards \nand if exhaustion was \u201cappropriate and in the inter-\nests of justice.\u201d \u00a7 1997e(a)(1), (2). \nBut that exhaustion provision did not stem the \ntide of prisoner litigation. By the mid-1990s, correc-\ntional systems and federal courts were overburdened \nby a mammoth caseload of prisoner litigation. In 1995 \nalone, 39,053 prisoner lawsuits were filed in federal \ncourt, a rate of 24.6 per 1,000 prisoners. Schlanger, \nTrends in Prisoner Litigation, supra, at 71. Not sur-\nprisingly, this strained the resources of the federal \ncourt system, not to mention correctional systems.  \nIn 1996, Congress enacted the PLRA \u201cin the wake \nof a sharp rise in prisoner litigation in the federal \ncourts.\u201d Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 84 (2006) \n\n5 \n \n(citing Alexander v. Hawk, 159 F.3d 1321, 1324\u201325 \n(11th Cir. 1998) (citing statistics)). A significant com-\nponent of the PLRA was a robust, mandatory exhaus-\ntion requirement. Congress \u201cinvigorated the exhaus-\ntion prescription\u201d that had existed under the prior re-\ngime, now requiring prisoners to fully exhaust all of \ntheir available administrative remedies through the \ngrievance process as a prerequisite to filing suit in fed-\neral court. Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 524 (2002).  \nAs stated by this Court, \u201cBeyond doubt, Congress \nenacted \u00a7 1997e(a) to reduce the quantity and improve \nthe quality of prisoner suits.\u201d Id. at 524. To further \nthis end, \u201cCongress afforded corrections officials time \nand opportunity to address complaints internally\u201d \nprior to prisoners seeking relief in federal court. Id. at \n525. By giving correctional officials the opportunity to \naddress grievances, \u201ccorrective action taken in re-\nsponse to an inmate\u2019s grievance might improve prison \nadministration and satisfy the inmate, thereby obvi-\nating the need for litigation.\u201d Id. (citing Booth v. \nChurner, 532 U.S. 731, 737 (2001)). In addition, a \nprison\u2019s \u201cinternal review might \u2018filter out some frivo-\nlous claims.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting Booth, 532 U.S. at 737). \nAnd the administrative record created by the prisons\u2019 \ninternal grievance processes would facilitate consider-\nation of those \u201ccases ultimately brought to court.\u201d Id. \n(citations omitted).  \nThe PLRA has been tremendously successful in \nreducing the burden on both prison officials and fed-\neral courts. From the peak of filings in 1995, within \nfive years of the passage of the PLRA prisoner law-\nsuits had fallen by 43%, even though the total prisoner \npopulation grew by 23%. Margo Schlanger, Inmate \n\n6 \n \nLitigation, 116 Harv. L. Rev. 1555, 1694 (2003). This \ndecline continued for several more years. By 2006, the \ndecline reached 60%. Margo Schlanger & Giovanna \nShay, Preserving the Rule of Law in America\u2019s Jails \nand Prisons: The Case for Amending the Prison Liti-\ngation Reform Act, 11 U. Pa. J. Const. L. 139, 141\u201342 \n(2008). Although the decline gradually plateaued, by \n2014, prisoners filed 25,324 lawsuits, a rate of 11.6 per \n1,000 prisoners. Schlanger, Trends in Prisoner Litiga-\ntion, supra, at 71. Compared to 1995, this represents \na 34% decrease in the number of prisoner lawsuits and \na 53% decline in the rate of lawsuits filed per 1,000 \nprisoners. See id. The exhaustion requirement has \nbeen a critical component of the PLRA\u2019s success.  \nB. MDOC\u2019s grievance process \nThe Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC) \nhas two separate processes for grievances. One is the \nstandard grievance procedure, governed by MDOC \nPolicy Directive 03.02.130, which is not applicable \nhere. J.A. 41\u201361. The other is the administrative pro-\ncess under the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA), \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 15601, et seq., and the Prohibited Sexual \nConduct Involving Prisoners policy (effective date \n04/24/2017), governed by MDOC Policy Directive \n03.03.140. J.A. 62\u201387.  \nThe PREA grievance procedure applies to Rich-\nards\u2019 claims of sexual abuse, harassment, and miscon-\nduct. MDOC uses a two-step process for PREA griev-\nances, both of which must be exhausted. J.A. 74\u201375. \nMDOC will not facially reject or deny grievances al-\nleging sexual abuse. J.A. 74\u201375. Instead, such \n\n7 \n \ngrievances must be investigated. J.A. 76. \u201cA prisoner \nmay file a PREA grievance at any time.\u201d J.A. 75.  \nA prisoner initiates the first step of the process by \nfiling a PREA Prisoner Grievance Form (Step I). \nJ.A. 75. Prisoners may grieve retaliation for reporting \nsexual abuse, harassment, or misconduct through the \nPREA grievance process. J.A. 72\u201373. PREA griev-\nances may not be referred to MDOC staff who are the \nsubject of the grievance. J.A. 76.  \nAt Step I, the PREA Coordinator1 must ensure \nthat \u201ca written response is provided to the prisoner \nwithin 60 calendar days of receipt of the Step I PREA \nGrievance,\u201d although an extension of up to 70 calen-\ndar days may be requested. J.A. 76\u201377. Prisoners \nmust be notified in writing of any extensions and the \ndue date for a response. J.A. 76\u201377.  \nPrisoners may appeal a Step I decision to Step II \nif they are unsatisfied with the response or the re-\nsponse was not timely. J.A. 77. MDOC\u2019s response to a \nStep II appeal is due within 90 calendar days of re-\nceipt, absent an extension, and it constitutes the final \ndecision in the matter. J.A. 77.  \nC. District Court Proceedings and Eviden-\ntiary Hearing \nRichards and co-Plaintiffs Kenneth Damon Pruitt \nand Robert Kissee filed suit under \u00a7 1983, alleging \nthat Perttu, a Resident Unit Manager (RUM) for the \nMDOC, sexually harassed them and other prisoners, \n \n1 Every prison has a PREA Coordinator designated by the war-\nden. J.A. 67.  \n\n8 \n \nretaliated against them, and destroyed their property, \nin violation of the First, Fifth, and Eighth Amend-\nments. J.A. 1\u201338. Perttu moved for summary judg-\nment, asserting that Richards and his co-Plaintiffs \nfailed to exhaust administrative remedies before filing \ntheir complaint. Pet. App. 3a. Richards and his co-\nPlaintiffs alleged that Perttu had destroyed their \ngrievances or otherwise prevented them from being \nprocessed, making the grievance process unavailable. \nPet. App. 30a, 37a, 59a\u201360a. \nThe district court denied Perttu\u2019s motion, finding \nthat there was a question of fact as to whether the \ngrievance process was available to Richards due to his \nallegation that Perttu interfered with his grievance \nfilings. Pet. App. 79a\u201381a, 83a.  \nFollowing this ruling, the magistrate judge con-\nducted an evidentiary hearing on the issue of exhaus-\ntion. J.A. 88\u2013368. Evaluating the testimony, evidence, \nand arguments presented, the magistrate judge rec-\nommended that the district court conclude that Perttu \ncarried his burden of establishing \u201cthat Plaintiffs \nfailed to exhaust any of their claims before filing suit,\u201d \nPet. App. 64a, 76a, and that the \u201cadministrative rem-\nedies were generally available\u201d to Richards and his co-\nPlaintiffs. Pet. App. 68a.  \nIn reaching that conclusion, the magistrate judge \nfound that Richards\u2019 direct examinations, which re-\nlied on leading questions, undermined the credibility \nof his witnesses. Pet. App. 69a. The magistrate judge \nthen discussed how the circumstances surrounding \nthe alleged observations of Perttu destroying griev-\nances similarly undermined Plaintiffs\u2019 credibility. Pet. \nApp. 71a\u201373a. Notably, the evidence \u201cdemonstrate[d] \n\n9 \n \nthat RUM Perttu could not, and in fact did not, inter-\ncept and destroy all grievances filed by Plaintiffs in \nthe relevant time\u201d: \n[E]ven on the dates that RUM Perttu worked, \nhe testified that he only works from 7:00am to \n3:30pm. Moreover, RUM Perttu did not work \nseven days a week every week from June 2019 \nto March 2020. Indeed, on at least one of the \ndates on which Richards alleges Perttu de-\nstroyed his grievances, January 1, 2020, \nPerttu testified that he was not working due \nto the New Years holiday. \nPet. App. 73a. \nMoreover, the evidence showed that Richards had \naccess to the grievance process: \nBut even had Perttu been working every hour \nof every day . . . Richards actually took ad-\nvantage of the grievance procedure by filing \nStep I grievance forms twenty-six times be-\ntween June 6, 2019, and April 23, 2020.  \n* * * \nMoreover, of Richards\u2019s six Step I grievance \nforms entered into evidence, three specifically \ngrieved RUM Perttu, undermining any allega-\ntion that Perttu sorted through the grievances \nand discarded those directed towards him.  \nPet. App. 73a\u201374a.  \n\n10 \n \nThe magistrate judge noted that \u201cRichards\u2019s suc-\ncessful use of the grievance procedure . . . directly con-\ntradicts Plaintiffs\u2019 claim that administrative remedies \nwere effectively unavailable, and Plaintiffs\u2019 failure \n[to] use any of the alternative reporting methods . . . \ncasts doubt on their alleged attempts to file PREA \ngrievances.\u201d Pet. App. 75a.  \nThe magistrate judge found that \u201cPlaintiffs pro-\nvided no evidence that RUM Perttu\u201d influenced the \ncorrections officers he supervised to destroy or not \nprocess their grievances. Pet. App. 75a. Indeed, \u201cthe \ncredibility of Plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses was undermined by \ntheir inability to independently recollect the time or \nlocation of RUM Perttu\u2019s alleged destruction of Plain-\ntiff\u2019s grievances, as well as the unlikely circumstances \nunder which they claimed they observed such destruc-\ntion.\u201d Pet. App. 75a\u201376a. For instance, as a matter of \n\u201ccommon sense,\u201d Perttu could not have been \u201cpresent \nto intercept every grievance\u201d filed by Plaintiffs. Pet. \nApp. 76a. Based on these findings, the magistrate \njudge recommended that the district court conclude \nthat Richards and his co-Plaintiffs failed to exhaust \ntheir claims against Perttu and dismiss their claims \nwithout prejudice. Pet. App. 76a.  \nRichards and his co-Plaintiffs filed nine objec-\ntions, which the district court overruled. Pet. App. \n22a\u201328a. The district court adopted the report and \nrecommendation and entered judgment for Perttu. \nPet. App. 29a. Richards alone appealed the district \ncourt\u2019s ruling.  \n\n11 \n \nD. Sixth Circuit Proceedings \nOn appeal, Richards argued that the district court \nerred by not granting him a jury trial to resolve the \nexhaustion issue, which he claimed was intertwined \nwith the merits of his case.  \nThe Sixth Circuit began its analysis by discussing \nwhether the exhaustion issue was intertwined with \nRichards\u2019 underlying retaliation claim, noting that \nRichards alleged that Perttu destroyed his grievances, \npreventing him from exhausting the grievance re-\nquirements. Richards\u2019 complaint, the Sixth Circuit \nsaid, \u201clays out several specific instances when Perttu \nallegedly destroyed grievances that Richards had in-\ntended to file.\u201d Pet. App. 2a\u20133a. This allegedly \u201cinter-\nfered with Richards\u2019s speech.\u201d Pet. App. 10a. Under \nthese circumstances, the court concluded that \u201cthe \nfactual disputes regarding exhaustion . . . are inter-\ntwined with the merits of Richards\u2019s retaliation \nclaim.\u201d Pet. App. 12a. \nThe Sixth Circuit turned its attention to whether \nthis intertwining implicated the Seventh Amendment \nright to a jury trial. The court recognized that, in Lee \nv. Willey, 789 F.3d 673 (6th Cir. 2015), it held that the \nprisoner had no right to a jury trial for an exhaustion \ndefense under the PLRA. Pet. App. 13a. But the court \nnoted that Lee did not govern the present case because \nthe disputed facts of the exhaustion issue were not \n\u201c \u2018bound up with the merits of the underlying dis-\npute.\u2019 \u201d Pet. App. 13a (quoting Lee, 789 F.3d at 678).  \nThe Sixth Circuit then looked to the other circuits, \nnoting that only the Seventh Circuit had squarely ad-\ndressed the issue, in Pavey v. Conley, 544 F.3d 739 \n\n12 \n \n(7th Cir. 2008). There, the Seventh Circuit held that \nprisoners had no right to a jury trial to determine \nwhether they had exhausted their administrative \nremedies under the PLRA, regardless of whether the \nexhaustion issue is intertwined with the merits of the \ncase. Pet. App. 14a (citing Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741\u201342). \nAccording to the Seventh Circuit, \u201c[j]uries decide \ncases, not issues of judicial traffic control.\u201d Pavey, 544 \nF.3d at 741. The Ninth Circuit agreed with the rea-\nsoning of Pavey in Albino v. Baca, 747 F.3d 1162, 1171 \n(9th Cir. 2014) (en banc) (citations omitted). Pet. App. \n14a. \nInstead of following the reasoning of the Seventh \nand Ninth Circuits, the Sixth Circuit found \u201cseveral \ndistrict-court decisions in the Second Circuit\u201d more \nconvincing. Pet. App. 15a\u201317a. It ultimately con-\ncluded that \u201cRichards was stripped of his right to a \njury\u2019s resolution of the ultimate dispute\u201d because he \nwas denied a jury trial on the exhaustion issue. Pet. \nApp. 17a (internal citation omitted). The Sixth Circuit \nalso relied on Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Co. v. Rail-\nway Express Agency, Inc., 253 F.2d 780, 784 (6th Cir. \n1958). Pet. App. 17a\u201319a. In Fireman\u2019s Fund, the \nSixth Circuit had held that when jurisdiction is inter-\ntwined with the merits of the case, the issue cannot be \nsummarily decided where factual claims would not be \nsubject to cross-examination. 253 F.2d at 784 (\u201cthe \nmerits of a controversy could be summarily decided, \npartly on affidavits without the right of cross-exami-\nnation\u201d) (citation omitted). \nThe Sixth Circuit held that the district court erred \nby ordering an evidentiary hearing rather than a jury \ntrial on the issue of exhaustion, \u201cemphasiz[ing] that a \n\n13 \n \njury trial is appropriate in these circumstances only if \nthe district court finds that genuine disputes of mate-\nrial fact concerning PLRA exhaustion are \u2018decisive of \nthe merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claim.\u2019 \u201d Pet. App. 19a \n(quoting Fireman\u2019s Fund, 253 F.2d at 784). \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe PLRA mandates that prisoners exhaust ad-\nministrative remedies before filing a lawsuit in fed-\neral court. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). Despite this precon-\ndition to suit, the Sixth Circuit held that prisoners are \nentitled to a jury trial when exhaustion disputes are \nintertwined with the merits of their claims. This con-\nclusion is not grounded in the Seventh Amendment. \n1. The Seventh Amendment permits courts to re-\nsolve disputed facts bearing on whether prisoners \nhave exhausted their claims. The Amendment pre-\nserves the right to a jury trial as it existed under the \nEnglish common law in 1791. Consistent with the \nAmendment\u2019s language, this Court has adhered to a \n\u201chistorical test,\u201d which asks two questions: (1) \nwhether the cause of action at issue \u201ceither was tried \nat law at the time of the founding or is at least analo-\ngous to one that was,\u201d Markman v. Westview Instru-\nments, Inc., 517 U.S. 370, 376 (1996) (citation omit-\nted), and (2) \u201c[i]f the action in question belongs in the \nlaw category, . . . whether the particular [issue] . . . \nmust fall to the jury in order to preserve the substance \nof the common-law right as it existed in 1791,\u201d id.  \nThis case turns on the second question, which, as \nthis Court has emphasized, \u201cmust depend on whether \nthe jury must shoulder this responsibility as neces-\nsary to preserve the \u2018substance of the common-law \n\n14 \n \nright of trial by jury.\u2019 \u201d Tull v. United States, 481 U.S. \n412, 426 (1987) (quoting Colgrove v. Battin, 413 U.S. \n149, 157 (1973)). The Court answers this question \nmuch like its first\u2014by using a historical method, and \n\u201c[w]here there is no exact antecedent,\u201d by \u201ccomparing \nthe modern practice to earlier ones whose allocation \nto court or jury we do know.\u201d Markman, 517 U.S. at \n378 (citations omitted).  \nExhaustion did not exist in 1791, and it was not \nuntil the twentieth century that courts fully articu-\nlated the doctrine. Thus, there is no exact antecedent \nto look to for answers. But exhaustion\u2019s roots in courts \nof equity provide helpful guidance. Exhaustion was \napplied by those courts to promote an orderly proce-\ndure whereby an administrative forum was the appro-\npriate starting point for a dispute. Other forum-based \nequitable defenses\u2014such as the adequate remedy at \nlaw doctrine, forum non conveniens, abstention, and \nhabeas corpus bars\u2014therefore provide a suitable his-\ntorical analog.  \nAt common law, these defenses were not afforded \na jury trial right. This was true regardless of whether \nthose defenses were interposed in courts of law, in \nwhich case a court of equity would first dispose of the \nissue. Only where an issue at law remained would \nthat issue be jury-triable. Because these equitable de-\nfenses were not subject to a jury determination at \ncommon law, neither should exhaustion.  \nEven if these historical analogs are insufficient, \nfunctional considerations should guide this Court\u2019s \ndecision. In this regard, the PLRA\u2019s goals\u2014\u201cto reduce \nthe quantity and improve the quality of prisoner \nsuits,\u201d \nPorter, \n534 \nU.S. \nat \n524\u2014would \nbe \n\n15 \n \ncompromised, if not outright defeated, by a jury trial \non exhaustion. The PLRA allows prison officials the \nopportunity to address prisoner complaints prior to \nfederal-court interference. This, in turn, obviates the \nneed for some prisoner lawsuits and creates an admin-\nistrative record for those that are filed.  \nJudges also frequently decide threshold issues \nand are thus better positioned than juries to decide \nexhaustion questions. And due to the significant num-\nber of prisoner cases judges see, they are particularly \nwell-equipped to deal with questions about a prison\u2019s \ninternal operations. Consequently, an exhaustion \nquestion should be allocated to the judge, not a jury.  \n2. That a question of exhaustion is intertwined \nwith the merits of a prisoner\u2019s claim does not change \nthis outcome. While Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, \n359 U.S. 500 (1959), establishes a general rule priori-\ntizing legal issues over equitable ones, it is a pruden-\ntial rule that is premised on the recognition that an \nequitable determination could have a collateral-estop-\npel effect on the merits of a legal claim. These con-\ncerns are not present for an exhaustion determina-\ntion, which is a threshold, pre-merits ruling that the \njury may revisit if an exhausted claim goes to trial. \nFurther, this Court has previously considered \nwhether application of the Beacon Theatres rule would \nundermine a federal statute. Here, the PLRA\u2019s pur-\nposes would be severely undercut by a jury trial on ex-\nhaustion.  \nFor these reasons, the Seventh Amendment does \nnot preserve the right to a jury trial on exhaustion of \nadministrative remedies where disputed facts regard-\ning exhaustion are intertwined with merits of a claim. \n\n16 \n \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe Seventh Amendment does not preserve \nthe right to a jury trial on factual questions \nconcerning exhaustion. \nJudges frequently decide disputed questions of \nfact without violating the Seventh Amendment, par-\nticularly with respect to threshold issues. It is thus no \nsurprise that all courts of appeal to have considered \nthe issue have held that \u201cjudges may resolve factual \ndisputes relevant to the exhaustion issue without the \nparticipation of a jury.\u201d Small v. Camden Cnty., 728 \nF.3d 265, 269\u201371 (3d Cir. 2013); see also Lee, 789 F.3d \nat 677\u201378; Albino, 747 F.3d at 1170\u201371; Messa v. \nGoord, 652 F.3d 305, 308\u201310 (2d Cir. 2011) (per cu-\nriam); Dillon v. Rogers, 596 F.3d 260, 270\u201372 (5th Cir. \n2010); Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741\u201342; Bryant v. Rich, 530 \nF.3d 1368, 1373\u201377 (11th Cir. 2008). These holdings \nare consistent with the Seventh Amendment, which \napplies only to issues tried by a jury in suits at com-\nmon law in 1791. Exhaustion, although unknown at \ncommon law, is rooted in equity and closely analogous \nto traditional equitable defenses, which were not his-\ntorically determined by juries.  \nA. This Court has held that judges can de-\ncide facts related to threshold issues\u2014\nlike exhaustion\u2014without violating the \nSeventh Amendment.  \nAs a general matter, \u201cissues of law are to be re-\nsolved by the court and issues of fact are to be deter-\nmined by the jury.\u201d Baltimore & Carolina Line, Inc. v. \nRedman, 295 U.S. 654, 657 (1935). But this broad \nproposition overstates the Amendment\u2019s sweep, for \n\n17 \n \n\u201cthe Seventh Amendment was never intended to es-\ntablish the jury as the exclusive mechanism for fact-\nfinding in civil cases.\u201d Atlas Roofing Co. v. Occupa-\ntional Safety & Health Review Comm\u2019n, 430 U.S. 442, \n460 (1977); see also Galloway v. United States, 319 \nU.S. 372, 390 (1943) (\u201cThe jury was not absolute mas-\nter of fact in 1791.\u201d). In this vein, this Court has held \nthat the Seventh Amendment \u201cwas designed to pre-\nserve the basic institution of jury trial in only its most \nfundamental elements, not the great mass of proce-\ndural forms and details, varying even then [in 1791] \nso widely among common-law jurisdictions.\u201d Gallo-\nway, 319 U.S. at 392; see also Walker v. N. M. & S. P. \nR. Co., 165 U.S. 593, 596 (1897) (\u201cThe seventh amend-\nment . . . does not attempt to regulate matters of \npleading or practice[.]\u201d).  \nJudges thus frequently decide disputed questions \nof fact without violating the Seventh Amendment. For \nexample, this Court has held that judges may decide \nquestions of fact related to subject-matter jurisdiction, \nWetmore v. Rymer, 169 U.S. 115, 120\u201322 (1898); dis-\ncovery disputes, Herbert v. Lando, 441 U.S. 153, 177 \n(1979); class certifications, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. \nDukes, 564 U.S. 338, 351\u201352 (2011); evidentiary objec-\ntions, Galloway, 319 U.S. at 390; motions for sum-\nmary judgment, Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 \nU.S. 322, 336 (1979); motions for directed verdict, Gal-\nloway, 283 U.S. at 391\u201395; and motions to set aside \nthe verdict, Gasoline Products Co. v. Champlin Refin-\ning Co., 283 U.S. 494, 497\u201398 (1943).  \n \n \n\n18 \n \nThis makes sense for at least two reasons. First, a \njudge\u2019s ability to determine fact disputes related to \nthreshold questions is consistent with the under-\nstanding that \u201c \u2018[t]he Seventh Amendment does not \nconfer the right to a trial, but only the right to have a \njury hear the case once it is determined that the litiga-\ntion should proceed before a court.\u2019 \u201d Caley v. Gulf-\nstream Aerospace Corp., 428 F.3d 1359, 1371 (11th \nCir. 2005) (quoting Am. Heritage Life Ins. Co. v. Orr, \n294 F.3d 702, 711 (5th Cir. 2002)), cert. denied, 548 \nU.S. 1128 (2006). In this sense a judge acts as a gate-\nkeeper, guarding the courthouse doors from those who \nseek entry but have not yet satisfied mandatory pre-\nconditions to suit. Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741 (\u201cJuries de-\ncide cases, not issues of judicial traffic control.\u201d).  \nSecond, and relatedly, \u201c[t]he limitation imposed \nby the [Seventh] [A]mendment is merely that enjoy-\nment of the right of trial by jury be not obstructed, and \nthat the ultimate determination of issues of fact by the \njury be not interfered with.\u201d In re Peterson, 253 U.S. \n300, 310 (1920) (emphasis added). In other words, the \nSeventh Amendment \u201cis concerned with substance \nand not with form.\u201d Dimick v. Schiedt, 293 U.S. 474, \n490 (1935); see also id. (\u201cThere is nothing in its history \nor language to suggest that the amendment had any \npurpose but to preserve the essentials of the jury trial \nas it was known to the common law before the adop-\ntion of the Constitution.\u201d); Walker, 165 U.S. at 596 \n(\u201cSo long as this substance of right is preserved, the \nprocedure by which this result shall be reached is \nwholly within the discretion of the legislature . . . .\u201d). \nWhere the jury\u2019s ultimate determination of the facts is \nnot obviated, the judge may serve as factfinder. \n\n19 \n \nBoth of these underpinnings apply with full force \nin the exhaustion context. Exhaustion is a threshold \nquestion. Under the PLRA, \u201c[u]ntil the issue of ex-\nhaustion is resolved, the court cannot know whether \nit is to decide the case or the prison authorities are to.\u201d \nPavey, 544 F.3d at 741. Further, a judge\u2019s exhaustion \ndetermination does not interfere with a jury\u2019s ulti-\nmate factfinding responsibility because dismissals for \nfailure to exhaust are generally without prejudice.2 \nSee Snider v. Melindez, 199 F.3d 108, 111\u201312 (2d Cir. \n1999) (explaining that exhaustion \u201cis often a tempo-\nrary, curable, procedural flaw\u201d). A prisoner may later \nrefile the lawsuit, so long as the prison\u2019s grievance \nprocedure is satisfied. And if the prisoner\u2019s case ulti-\nmately proceeds to trial, the jury may revisit facts \nfound by the judge that may have been relevant to the \nexhaustion determination. See Part II; see also Pavey, \n544 F.3d at 742.  \nB. The Seventh Amendment does not pre-\nserve the right to a jury trial on any fac-\ntual questions concerning exhaustion be-\ncause exhaustion derives from equity.  \nAlthough the types of claims Richards brought are \nthose to which a jury trial applies, this Court has \n \n2 Along these lines, some courts have identified exhaustion as \nmatter in abatement, Bryant, 530 F.3d at 1374; Small, 728 F.3d \nat 269 n.3 (citation omitted), which is unsurprising since \u201cabate-\nment defense[s] defeat the particular action for procedural de-\nfects that are unrelated to the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claim,\u201d and \nthe plaintiff can therefore \u201ctypically correct the defects and pro-\nceed in another action,\u201d Hyman v. City of Gastonia, 466 F.3d 284, \n287 (4th Cir. 2006) (citing Bowles v. Wilke, 175 F.2d 35, 38 (7th \nCir. 1949)).  \n\n20 \n \nrecognized the need for a separate historical analysis \nfor particular issues or trial decisions within jury-ap-\npropriate claims. Under this analysis, there is no ex-\nact antecedent for exhaustion. But its equitable ori-\ngins and the characteristics of the doctrine show that \nits closest parallel lies in equitable defenses\u2014which \nwere historically decided by judges, not juries.  \n1. The Seventh Amendment guarantees \na jury trial right only as to issues \ntried by a jury in suits at common law \nat the time the Seventh Amendment \nwas adopted.  \nThe Seventh Amendment \u201cpreserve[s]\u201d the right \nto jury trial \u201c[i]n Suits at common law.\u201d U.S. Const. \namend. VII. Because the Amendment speaks in terms \nof preservation, this Court has long held that the \nscope of the right must be determined by reference to \nhistory. Indeed, \u201c[f]rom the beginning, it has been re-\ngarded as but subservient to the single purpose of the \nAmendment, to preserve the essentials of the jury \ntrial in actions at law, serving to distinguish them \nfrom suits in equity and admiralty[.]\u201d Dimick, 293 \nU.S. at 490\u201391 (citation omitted); Granfinanciera, \nS.A. v. Nordberg, 492 U.S. 33, 42 (1989) (explaining \nthat the Seventh Amendment applies to actions \u201cthat \nare analogous to common-law causes of action ordi-\nnarily decided in English law courts in the late 18th \ncentury, as opposed to those customarily heard by \ncourts of equity or admiralty\u201d) (citation omitted). Con-\nsistent with this command, \u201cresort must be had to the \nappropriate rules of the common law established at \nthe time of the adoption of that constitutional provi-\nsion in 1791.\u201d Dimick, 293 U.S. at 476. See also \n\n21 \n \nBaltimore & Carolina Line, Inc., 295 U.S. at 657 \n(\u201c[T]he right of trial by jury thus preserved is the right \nwhich existed under the English common law when \nthe Amendment was adopted.\u201d).  \nThis historical lens does not mean that the right \nto a jury trial is available only in suits \u201cwhich the com-\nmon law recognized among its old and settled proceed-\nings.\u201d Parsons v. Bedford, Breedlove & Robeson, 28 \nU.S. 433, 447 (1830). As this Court has noted, histori-\ncal analysis allows for reasoning by analogy. There-\nfore, the determination whether the Seventh Amend-\nment confers a right to a jury trial entails a two-part \ninquiry. A court first considers whether it is \u201c \u2018dealing \nwith a cause of action that either was tried at law at \nthe time of the founding or is at least analogous to one \nthat was.\u2019 \u201d City of Monterey v. Del Monte Dunes at \nMonterey, Ltd., 526 U.S. 687, 708 (1999) (quoting \nMarkman, 517 U.S. at 376). If a court determines that \n\u201cthe action in question belongs in the law category,\u201d it \nmust \u201cthen ask whether the particular trial decision \nmust fall to the jury in order to preserve the substance \nof the common-law right as it existed in 1791.\u201d Mark-\nman, 517 U.S. at 708 (emphasis added). See also Tull, \n481 U.S. at 426 (\u201c \u2018Only those incidents which are re-\ngarded as fundamental, as inherent in and of the es-\nsence of the system of trial by jury, are placed beyond \nthe reach of the legislature.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting Colgrove, 413 \nU.S. at 156 n.11.).  \nAs applied to this case, the first inquiry is \nstraightforward. While the scope of prisoners\u2019 federal \nrights was significantly limited at common law, see, \ne.g., Ruffin v. Commonwealth, 62 Va. 790, 799 (1871); \nBethea v. Crouse, 417 F.2d 504, 505 (10th Cir. 1969), \n\n22 \n \nfollowing Del Monte Dunes, 526 U.S. at 720\u201321, the \ntypes of claims that Richards brought\u2014\u00a7 1983 claims \nfor damages\u2014are those for which a jury trial applies.  \nThis conclusion is not the end of the inquiry, \nthough. Rather, it leads to the second question\u2014\nwhether the particular issue of exhaustion is \u201cproper \nfor determination by the jury.\u201d3 Id. at 718; see also id. \nat 731 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and in concurring \nin the judgment) (\u201cTo say that respondents had the \nright to a jury trial on their \u00a7 1983 claim is not to say \nthat they were entitled to have the jury decide every \nissue.\u201d); Google LLC v. Oracle Am., Inc. 593 U.S. 1, 25 \n(2021) (rejecting an argument that the jury should de-\ncide a fair-use defense). As explained below, it is not.  \n2. Exhaustion did not exist at the com-\nmon law, but closely analogous equi-\ntable issues were not decided by ju-\nries in 1791.  \nTo answer the second question\u2014whether exhaus-\ntion should be determined by a judge or jury\u2014this \nCourt again looks to history, asking \u201cwhether the par-\nticular issue, or analogous ones, were decided by judge \nor by jury in suits at common law at the time the Sev-\nenth Amendment was adopted.\u201d Del Monte Dunes, 526 \nU.S. at 718; see also Markman, 517 U.S. at 378 \n(\u201cWhere there is no exact antecedent, the best hope \n \n3 The practice of submitting some issues for judicial determina-\ntion, while others are submitted to the jury, is consistent with \nFed.

These \norigins and exhaustion\u2019s characteristics result in an \nappropriate analog\u2014equitable defenses\u2014for which \nthere was no traditional right to a jury trial. \na. No historical antecedent to exhaustion \nexisted at common law, but its origins \nare equitable in nature. \nThe doctrine of exhaustion \u201cis as old as federal ad-\nministrative law,\u201d meaning that it did not begin to \ntake shape until the creation of the Interstate Com-\nmerce Commission in 1887. Raoul Berger, Exhaustion \nof Administrative Remedies, 48 Yale L.J. 981, 981 n.1 \n(1939). Intended as a rule of \u201corderly\u201d procedure de-\nsigned to allow administrative bodies to perform their \nstatutory functions without preliminary interference \nfrom the courts, United States v. Sing Tuck, 194 U.S. \n161, 168 (1904), the concept first arose in tax cases in \nwhich courts of equity refused to grant injunctive re-\nlief where a plaintiff failed to pursue administrative \nremedies.  \nIn Dundee Mortgage Trust Invest Co. v. Charlton, \n32 F. 192, 192\u201393 (C.C.D. Ore. 1887), for example, a \ncorporation brought suit in equity to enjoin the \n\n24 \n \ncollection of its taxes, arguing that the county asses-\nsor and county board of equalization had erred in their \nassessment. While the court agreed that the corpora-\ntion \u201cappear[ed] to be entitled to an injunction,\u201d id. at \n193, it nevertheless held that the corporation was not \nentitled to relief because it did not seek redress from \nthe county board of equalization, as provided by stat-\nute, id. at 193\u201394. \u201c[T]he plaintiff, having neglected to \navail itself of this means of redress, cannot maintain \na suit for relief in this court.\u201d Id. at 195; see also Alt-\nschul v. Gittings, 86 F. 200, 202 (C.C.D. Ore. 1898) \n(No. 2,236) (same); Brown v. Drain, 112 F. 582, 585 \n(C.C.S.D. Cal. 1901) (\u201cThe remedy of one who consid-\ners himself unfairly assessed is to apply for redress to \nthe statutory tribunal, if one is provided with the \npower to review.\u201d).  \nThe exhaustion concept was applied in courts of \nequity in other contexts as well. In Sing Tuck, an im-\nmigration case in which the Court denied a writ a ha-\nbeas corpus, the Court concluded that the petitioner \nfailed to comply with the \u201cmode of procedure which \nmust be followed before there can be resort to the \ncourts.\u201d 194 U.S. at 167. Explaining that \u201cit is one of \nthe necessities of the administration of justice that \neven fundamental questions should be determined in \nan orderly way,\u201d the Court reasoned that the peti-\ntioner failed to first file an appeal with the Secretary \nof Commerce and Labor. Id. at 168. The Court analo-\ngized the exhaustion requirement to habeas corpus \ncases arising out of state confinement:  \nA familiar illustration is that of a person im-\nprisoned upon criminal process by a state \ncourt, under a state law alleged to be \n\n25 \n \nunconstitutional. If the law is unconstitu-\ntional the prisoner is wrongfully held. Yet, ex-\ncept under exceptional circumstances, the \ncourts of the United States do not interfere by \nhabeas corpus. The prisoner must, in the first \nplace, take his case to the highest court of the \nstate to which he can go, and after that he gen-\nerally is left to the remedy by writ of error if \nhe wishes to bring the case here.  \nId. (citations omitted). Because the petitioner failed to \nfirst resort to his administrative remedy, any attempt \n\u201cto swamp the courts by resort to them in the first in-\nstance[ ] must fail.\u201d Id. at 170; see also id. (\u201c[B]efore \nthe courts can be called upon, the preliminary sifting \nprocess provided by the statutes must be gone through \nwith. Whether after that a further trial may be had \nwe do not decide.\u201d). Other cases highlight exhaustion\u2019s \nequitable origins. E.g. Pittsburgh Ry. v. Bd. of Pub. \nWorks, 172 U.S. 32, 47 (1898); United States v. Abilene \n& S. Ry. Co., 265 U.S. 274, 282 (1924); United States \nv. Ill. Cent. R.R. Co., 291 U.S. 457, 463 (1934); Natural \nGas Pipeline Co. v. Slattery, 302 U.S. 300, 310\u201311 \n(1937).  \nWhile these cases confirm exhaustion\u2019s equitable \norigins, the doctrine, as we understand it today, did \nnot fully emerge until the twentieth century. See John \nF. Duffy, Administrative Common Law in Judicial Re-\nview, 77 Tex. L. Rev. 113, 154 (1998) (explaining that \n\u201c[i]n the early part of th[e] [twentieth] century, the \ndoctrine was still quite amorphous, and as late as the \n1920\u2019s, courts were still using other equitable doc-\ntrines . . . to decide cases that would later be consid-\nered exhaustion precedents\u201d). Indeed, it was only in \n\n26 \n \n1938, in Myers v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Co., 303 \nU.S. 41 (1938), that this Court expressly articulated \nthe modern underpinning of the doctrine. See Duffy, \nsupra, at 155.  \nIn Myers, the Court declined a request to enjoin \nthe National Labor Relations Board\u2019s administrative \nproceedings despite allegations that the NLRB lacked \njurisdiction. Id. at 43, 46. The Court refused to grant \ninjunctive relief, in part on the ground that \u201cno one is \nentitled to judicial relief for a supposed or threatened \ninjury until the prescribed administrative remedy has \nbeen exhausted.\u201d Id. at 50. The Court recognized the \nexhaustion doctrine\u2019s equitable roots, see id. at 51 n.9 \n(\u201cThe rule has been most frequently applied in equity \nwhere relief by injunction was sought\u201d) (citation omit-\nted), and noted the extension of the doctrine to courts \nof law, id. (\u201cbecause the rule is one of judicial admin-\nistration\u2014not merely a rule governing the exercise of \ndiscretion\u2014it is applicable to proceedings at law as \nwell as suits in equity\u201d) (citations omitted). Myers \nstands as \u201cthe seminal decision\u201d on the exhaustion \ndoctrine and has been described as \u201ccomplet[ing] the \ndoctrine\u2019s evolution.\u201d Duffy, supra, at 155. \nIn short, although exhaustion has deep roots in \nequity, the doctrine as we know it today was unknown \nin the late eighteenth century. Consequently, there is \nno \u201cclear historical evidence that the very . . . ques-\ntion\u201d of exhaustion was a question for the jury under \nthe common law. Markman, 517 U.S. at 377. \n\n27 \n \nb. Traditional equitable defenses such as \nadequate remedy at law, forum non \nconveniens, abstention, and habeas \ncorpus bars are an appropriate com-\nmon-law analog for exhaustion.  \nWith no precise analog existing in the English \ncommon law, \u201cthe best hope lies in comparing the \nmodern practice to earlier ones whose allocation to \ncourt or jury we do know, . . . seeking the best analogy \nwe can draw between the old and the new.\u201d Markman, \n517 U.S. at 378 (citations omitted). In this regard, this \nCourt has instructed that the analog be \u201cappropriate\u201d \nrather than \u201cprecise[ ],\u201d Tull, 481 U.S. at 420\u201321, and \ncan be drawn on the basis of function, Markman, 517 \nU.S. at 379\u201380.  \nExhaustion\u2019s foundations in courts of equity pro-\nvide a logical starting point in the search for an appro-\npriate analog. As explained in the prior section, from \nits earliest articulations, it was viewed as a limitation, \nalbeit discretionary, on a court\u2019s equitable jurisdic-\ntion. See Charlton, 32 F. at 195; Altschul, 86 F. at 202. \nIn other words, a court of equity would not exercise its \nextraordinary powers where a plaintiff failed to avail \nitself of an available administrative process. Gorham \nMfg. Co. v. State Tax Comm\u2019n of N.Y., 266 U.S. 265, \n270 (1924) (holding that the petitioner, \u201chaving failed \nto avail itself of the administrative remedy provided \nby the statute . . . was not entitled to maintain a bill \nin equity\u201d); Ill. Cent. R.R. Co., 291 U.S. at 463 (\u201cThe \nvarious steps to be taken constitute parts of the ad-\nministrative process which must be completed before \nthe extraordinary powers of a court of equity may be \ninvoked.\u201d) (citation omitted); Slattery, 302 U.S. 300, \n310\u201311 (1937) (\u201cThe rule that a suitor must exhaust \n\n28 \n \nhis administrative remedies before seeking the ex-\ntraordinary relief of a court of equity . . . is of special \nforce when resort is had to the federal courts to re-\nstrain the action of state officers.\u201d) (citations omitted); \nIsland Creek Coal Co. v. Bryan, 937 F.3d 738, 748 (6th \nCir. 2019) (noting that \u201cthe exhaustion \u2018doctrine had \nits origin in a discretionary rule adopted by courts of \nequity to the effect that a petitioner will be denied eq-\nuitable relief when he has failed to pursue an availa-\nble administrative remedy by which he might obtain \nthe same relief.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting Smith v. United States, \n199 F.2d 377, 381 (1st Cir. 1952)).  \nThus, historically, exhaustion was an equitable \ndefense applied by courts when another forum\u2014an \nadministrative tribunal or agency\u2014was the more ap-\npropriate starting point for a dispute. Tracking this \nprinciple, this Court has said that exhaustion \u201cserves \nthe twin purposes of protecting administrative agency \nauthority and promoting judicial efficiency.\u201d McCar-\nthy v. Madigan, 503 U.S. 140, 145 (1992), superseded \nby statute, \u00a7 1997e(a), as recognized in Woodford, 548 \nU.S. at 84\u201385. As to the first purpose, the exhaustion \nrequirement \u201crecognizes the notion, grounded in def-\nerence to Congress\u2019 delegation of authority to coordi-\nnate branches of Government, that agencies, not the \ncourts, ought to have primary responsibility for the \nprograms that Congress has charged them to admin-\nister.\u201d Id.; see id. (\u201cThe exhaustion doctrine recognizes \nthe commonsense notion of dispute resolution that an \nagency ought to have an opportunity to correct its own \nmistakes . . . before it is haled into federal court.\u201d) (em-\nphasis added); Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 492 \n(1973) (\u201cSince the[ ] internal problems of state prisons \ninvolve issues so peculiarly within state authority and \n\n29 \n \nexpertise, the States have an important interest in not \nbeing bypassed in the correction of those problems.\u201d). \nAs to the second purpose, \u201c[w]hen an agency has the \nopportunity to correct its own errors, a judicial contro-\nversy may well be mooted, or at least piecemeal ap-\npeals may be avoided.\u201d McCarthy, 503 U.S. at 145 (ci-\ntations omitted).  \nThese twin purposes call back to early articula-\ntions of the exhaustion doctrine as a rule of \u201corderly\u201d \nprocedure. Sing Tuck, 194 U.S. at 168, 173. And alt-\nhough the exhaustion doctrine was discretionary, as \nopposed to jurisdictional, Slattery, 302 U.S. at 311 (ex-\nplaining that the rule \u201crests in the sound discretion \nwhich guides exercise of equity jurisdiction\u201d) (cita-\ntions omitted); Abilene & S. Ry. Co., 265 U.S. at 282, \nit nevertheless was treated by courts of equity as a \nthreshold inquiry, see Sing Tuck, 194 U.S. at 168, 170.  \nThese guideposts offer a clear path in the search \nfor an appropriate common law analog. Indeed, ex-\nhaustion\u2019s origins as a forum-based equitable defense \ncall to mind other similar equitable defenses\u2014the ad-\nequate remedy at law doctrine, forum non conveniens, \nabstention, and habeas corpus bars.  \nAdequate remedy at law. The adequate remedy at \nlaw doctrine was a fundamental principle guiding \ncourts of equity. These courts \u201cstood ready to fashion \nremedies for legal wrongs, so long as the basic require-\nments of equity\u2014such as irreparable injury and no \nadequate remedy at law\u2014were met.\u201d Duffy, supra, at \n124. See also Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 43\u201344 \n(1971) (\u201cOne is the basic doctrine of equity jurispru-\ndence that courts of equity should not act . . . when the \nmoving party has an adequate remedy at law and will \n\n30 \n \nnot suffer irreparable injury if denied equitable re-\nlief.\u201d); Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U.S. \n374, 381 (1992) (\u201cIt is a \u2018basic doctrine of equity juris-\nprudence that courts of equity should not act . . . when \nthe moving party has an adequate remedy at law[.]\u2019 \u201d) \n(citations omitted).  \nThe adequate remedy at law doctrine was \ngrounded in comity and federalism concerns, with fed-\neral equity courts refusing to provide relief where it \nwas available at law in federal courts of law, Great \nLakes Co. v. Huffman, 319 U.S. 293, 297 (1943) (cita-\ntion omitted), as well as in state proceedings, Trainor \nv. Hernandez, 431 U.S. 434, 441 (1977). This doctrine, \nlike exhaustion, thus focused on whether a court of eq-\nuity should defer to another court (or forum) to hear \nthe dispute. And, like exhaustion, courts viewed the \ndoctrine as a threshold issue. Brown, Bonnell & Co. v. \nLake Superior Iron Co., 134 U.S. 530, 536 (1890) (ex-\nplaining that the adequate remedy at law objection \n\u201cshould be taken at the earliest opportunity\u201d). \nForum non conveniens. Under this equitable, com-\nmon-law doctrine, a federal court may dismiss an ac-\ntion in favor of an alternative forum when, among \nother things, \u201cthe chosen forum [is] inappropriate be-\ncause of considerations affecting the court\u2019s own ad-\nministration and legal problems.\u201d Koster v. Am. Lum-\nbermens Mut. Cas. Co., 330 U.S. 518, 524 (1947); see \nalso Gulf Oil Corp. v. Gilbert, 330 U.S. 501, 506\u201307 \n(1947) (explaining that the doctrine is premised on the \nassumption that there are \u201cat least two forums in \nwhich the defendant is amenable to process\u201d). Both fo-\nrum non conveniens and exhaustion therefore permit \ncourts to consider judicial efficiency in deciding \n\n31 \n \nwhether they are the appropriate forum for a case to \nbe heard. See Sinochem Int\u2019l Co. v. Malaysia Int\u2019l \nShipping Corp., 549 U.S. 422, 432 (2007) (\u201cA district \ncourt . . . may dispose of an action by a forum non con-\nveniens dismissal, bypassing questions of subject-mat-\nter and personal jurisdiction, when considerations of \nconvenience, fairness, and judicial economy so war-\nrant.\u201d).  \nAbstention. \u201c[E]xhaustion of administrative reme-\ndies\u201d in general and \u201cabstention\u201d are \u201crelated doc-\ntrines.\u201d McCarthy, 503 U.S. at 144. As with exhaus-\ntion, the power of a federal court to dismiss a case via \nabstention \u201cderives from the discretion historically \nenjoyed by courts of equity.\u201d Quackenbush v. Allstate \nIns. Co., 517 U.S. 706, 728 (1996). The driving princi-\nples behind exhaustion and abstention also share a \ncommon root\u2014deference to state or administrative \nauthority. See id. at 728 (quoting Burford v. Sun Oil \nCo., 319 U.S. 315, 334 (1943)). Younger abstention, for \nexample, respects a \u201cState\u2019s interest in pursuing an \nongoing state proceeding,\u201d Ohio Bureau of Emp. \nServs. v. Hodory, 431 U.S. 471, 477 (1977) (citations \nomitted), barring a federal court from enjoining a \nstate prosecution, a civil enforcement action, or a \nunique state action that \u201cimplicate[s] a State\u2019s inter-\nest in enforcing the orders and judgments of its \ncourts,\u201d Sprint Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v. Jacobs, 571 U.S. 69, \n72\u201373 (2013). Likewise, PLRA exhaustion requires a \nfederal court to stay its hand where a state has not \nhad its full opportunity to regulate its own prisons by \nconsidering a prisoner\u2019s grievance. \nHabeas Corpus. Federal habeas principles rein-\nforce the analogy between exhaustion and equitable \n\n32 \n \ndefenses. Indeed, this Court explicitly linked PLRA \nexhaustion requirements to certain habeas defenses, \ndeeming them \u201csubstantively similar.\u201d Woodford, 548 \nU.S. at 92; see also Schlesinger v. Councilman, 420 \nU.S. 738, 756 (1975) (noting that \u201cthe practical consid-\nerations supporting . . . the exhaustion requirement in \nhabeas corpus . . . are similar to those that underlie \nthe requirement of exhaustion of administrative rem-\nedies\u201d) (citation omitted).  \nHabeas exhaustion, like PLRA exhaustion, \nsounds in equity. Withrow v. Williams, 507 U.S. 680, \n699 (1993) (\u201cConcerns for equity and federalism reso-\nnate throughout our habeas jurisprudence.\u201d) (Scalia, \nJ., concurring in part); Erica Hashimoto, Reclaiming \nthe Equitable Heritage of Habeas, 108 Nw. U. L. Rev. \n139, 142 (2013) (habeas defenses \u201cshare features that \ncorrespond with the [habeas] remedy\u2019s historical equi-\ntable origins\u201d). Premised on the same equitable under-\npinnings as administrative exhaustion, habeas ex-\nhaustion requires a prisoner to avail himself of all \n\u201cavailable\u201d state-court remedies before entering fed-\neral court to seek a writ of habeas corpus. 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2254(c); see also O\u2019Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U.S. \n838, 847 (1999). \nThe doctrine of procedural default, 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2254(b)(1)(A), (c), another limitation on habeas re-\nlief, also shares similarities with exhaustion. It pre-\nvents federal court review of a claim that has not been \nproperly presented to the state courts. Woodford, 548 \nU.S. at 92. Procedural default guards against \u201cover-\nturning a state-court conviction without the state \ncourts having had an opportunity to correct the con-\nstitutional violation in the first instance.\u201d Id. (quoting \n\n33 \n \nO\u2019Sullivan, 526 U.S. at 845). That requirement mir-\nrors PLRA exhaustion\u2014giving prison systems the op-\nportunity to correct violations before litigating in fed-\neral court. See Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509, 518\u201319 \n(1982). \n3. Juries did not historically determine \nquestions of fact related to equitable \ndefenses analogous to exhaustion.  \nWith these similarities in mind, these equitable \ndefenses offer a sound analog to exhaustion, and \neighteenth-century practices concerning these de-\nfenses are instructive. It is well understood that a \nplaintiff is not entitled to have a jury determine a dis-\nputed affirmative defense that is equitable in nature. \nLiberty Oil Co. v. Condon Nat\u2019l Bank, 260 U.S. 235, \n242\u201343 (1922) (\u201cThe equitable defense makes the is-\nsue equitable, and it is to be tried to the judge as a \nchancellor.\u201d); Tull, 481 U.S. at 417 (\u201c[T]hose actions \nthat are analogous to 18th-century cases tried in \ncourts of equity . . . do not require a jury trial.\u201d) (cita-\ntion omitted); Granite State Ins. Co. v. Smart Modular \nTechs., 76 F.3d 1023, 1027 (9th Cir. 1996) (\u201cA litigant \nis not entitled to have a jury resolve a disputed affirm-\native defense if the defense is equitable in nature.\u201d) \n(citation omitted); Smith v. World Ins. Co., 38 F.3d \n1456, 1462 (8th Cir. 1994) (\u201c[T]he determination of eq-\nuitable defenses and equitable remedies is a matter \nfor the court to decide, not the jury.\u201d). This was true \neven where an equitable defense was \u201cinterposed in \n[an] action at law,\u201d in which circumstance the equita-\nble defense was generally \u201cfirst . . . disposed of as in a \ncourt of equity, and then, if an issue at law remain[ed], \nit [was] triable to a jury.\u201d Liberty Oil Co., 260 U.S. at \n\n34 \n \n242 (citations omitted). This equity-first order of oper-\nations was laid out by this Court over 100 years ago:  \nThe same order is preserved as under the sys-\ntem of separate courts. If a defendant at law \nhad an equitable defense, he resorted to a bill \nin equity to enjoin the suit at law, until he \ncould make his equitable defense effective by \na hearing before the chancellor. The hearing \non that bill was before the chancellor, and not \nbefore a jury, and, if the prayer of the bill was \ngranted, the injunction against the suit at law \nwas made perpetual, and no jury trial ensued. \nIf the injunction was denied, the suit at law \nproceeded to verdict and judgment. This was \nthe practice in the courts of law and chancery \nin England when our Constitution and the \nSeventh Amendment were adopted, and it is \nin the light of such practice that the Seventh \nAmendment is to be construed. \nId. at 243.  \n* * * \nIn sum, exhaustion was not part of the common \nlaw in 1791, and it has its origins in equity. This his-\ntorical background, along with exhaustion\u2019s func-\ntional similarities to forum-based equitable defenses \nsuch as adequate remedy at law, forum non conven-\niens, abstention, and habeas bars\u2014all historically \nnon-jury issues\u2014leads to the conclusion that the Sev-\nenth Amendment does not require juries to try ex-\nhaustion inquiries.  \n\n35 \n \n4. Functional considerations demon-\nstrate that judges, not juries, should \ndetermine exhaustion questions.  \nEven if history did not provide a clear answer, this \nCourt can, as a last resort, \u201clook elsewhere\u201d\u2015including \nat \u201cstatutory policies\u201d and the respective skills of \njudges and juries\u2015to inform the proper allocation be-\ntween a court or jury for purposes of the Seventh \nAmendment. Markman, 517 U.S. at 384; see also Del \nMonte Dunes, 526 U.S. at 718 (citation omitted). \nBeginning with the statutory policies at issue, the \nPLRA\u2019s statutory history is well documented. \u201cCon-\ngress enacted the [PLRA] . . . in 1996 in the wake of a \nsharp rise in prisoner litigation in the federal courts.\u201d \nWoodford, 548 U.S. at 84 (citing Alexander, 159 F.3d \nat 1324\u201325). The statute thus contains a variety of \ngatekeeping provisions \u201cdesigned to bring this litiga-\ntion under control.\u201d Id. (citations omitted). A \u201ccenter-\npiece\u201d of this effort is the PLRA\u2019s exhaustion require-\nment. Id. (citation omitted). \nThe PLRA\u2019s exhaustion requirement was, \u201cbeyond \ndoubt,\u201d \u201cenacted . . . to reduce the quantity and im-\nprove the quality of prisoner suits[.]\u201d Porter, 534 U.S. \nat 524. To this end, the provision \u201cafford[s] corrections \nofficials time and opportunity to address complaints \ninternally before allowing the initiation of a federal \ncase.\u201d Id. at 525 (emphasis added); see also Woodford, \n548 U.S. at 93 (\u201cThe PLRA attempts to eliminate un-\nwarranted federal-court interference with the admin-\nistration of prisons . . . .\u201d). This might \u201cobviat[e] the \nneed for litigation\u201d in some instances, or it might \u201cfil-\nter out some frivolous claims.\u201d Porter, 534 U.S. at 525 \n(citing Booth, 532 U.S. at 737). For cases that do make \n\n36 \n \nit to court, \u201cadjudication could be facilitated by an ad-\nministrative record that clarifies the contours of the \ncontroversy.\u201d Id. (citing Booth, 532 U.S. at 737); see \nalso Woodford, 548 U.S. at 95 (\u201cWhen a grievance is \nfiled shortly after the event giving rise to the griev-\nance, witnesses can be identified and questioned while \nmemories are still fresh, and evidence can be gathered \nand preserved.\u201d). These goals mirror the purposes of \ntraditional administrative exhaustion\u2014they safe-\nguard \u201cadministrative agency authority and pro-\nmot[e] judicial efficiency.\u201d McCarthy, 503 U.S. at 145.  \nThese goals would be severely undercut if a court \nwere to permit an exhaustion question to go to the \njury. Prison officials would be denied the opportunity \nto address and potentially rectify complaints inter-\nnally. Unexhausted claims could proceed to discovery \nwithout the benefits of full administrative record. \nMost critically, exhaustion questions would require ei-\nther a mini-jury trial before the merits adjudication or \na jury trial heard simultaneously with the merits. In \neither scenario, judicial resources and jurors\u2019 time \nwould be expended on claims that should never have \nreached the courthouse doors. Such a result directly \ncontradicts the PLRA\u2019s aims. \nOn the second point, judges\u2019 established role as \ngatekeepers in prisoner lawsuits supports the conclu-\nsion that judges, not juries, are \u201cbetter suited\u201d to as-\ncertain a prisoner\u2019s compliance with the exhaustion \nrequirement. See Markman, 517 U.S. at 384, 388\u201389 \n(consulting \u201cexisting precedent\u201d and considering \u201cthe \nrelative interpretive skills of judges and juries\u201d); Del \nMonte Dunes, 526 U.S. at 720 (looking to \u201cconsidera-\ntions of process and function\u201d). As explained in Part \n\n37 \n \nI(A), judges routinely resolve threshold issues and act \nas gatekeepers on factual questions that would other-\nwise be presented to the jury. This is especially true \nin PLRA cases, where, due to the sheer volume of pris-\noner lawsuits, Alexander, 159 F.3d at 1324, judges are \nwell-acquainted with the internal operations of prison \nsystems and their multi-level grievance processes. \nThe screening requirement of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A rein-\nforces this notion, as judges already ensure compli-\nance with other aspects of the PLRA. This knowledge \nbase has well prepared the judiciary to settle ques-\ntions surrounding exhaustion under the PLRA. \nThese considerations provide sufficient reason to \ntreat the disposition of questions of fact concerning ex-\nhaustion like many other factfinding responsibilities \nceded to judges in the normal course of litigation.  \nII. The Seventh Amendment does not preserve \nthe right to a jury trial on factual questions \nconcerning exhaustion even when those fac-\ntual questions are intertwined with the un-\nderlying merits. \nAt common law, the Seventh Amendment did not \npreserve the right to a jury trial on equitable defenses \nsuch as exhaustion. Following the merger of the courts \nof law and equity in 1938, however, courts have recog-\nnized that \u201c[d]ifficulties may arise . . . when the legal \nand equitable issues overlap and the evidence is inter-\ntwined.\u201d Danjaq LLC v. Sony Corp., 263 F.3d 942, 962 \n(9th Cir. 2001); Ross v. Bernhard, 396 U.S. 531, 536\u2013\n39 (1970). This Court has held that, as a prudential \nmatter, where factual issues overlap between legal \nand equitable issues, jury-triable issues should \n\n38 \n \ngenerally be prioritized. See, e.g., Beacon Theatres, \n359 U.S. at 510\u201311; Dairy Queen, Inc. v. Wood, 369 \nU.S. 469, 472\u201373 (1962).  \nBut exhaustion remains a threshold precondition \nto suit that, by its nature, must be determined before \nthe merits. With that that order of operation in mind, \nthis Court has applied the Beacon Theatres principle \nonly where an equitable claim could, through collat-\neral estoppel or res judicata, bar a subsequent jury \ntrial on a legal claim. Exhaustion does not present \nsuch a circumstance. And, in any event, this Court has \nconsidered departure from the Beacon Theatres pru-\ndential rule when it would undercut congressional in-\ntent, as it would here. For these reasons, Richards \ndoes not have a jury trial right on factual questions \nconcerning exhaustion\u2014even when those questions \nare intertwined with the merits of his claims.  \nA. Beacon Theatres created a presumption \nthat juries should decide intertwined le-\ngal and equitable issues, but that pre-\nsumption does not apply here.  \nBeacon Theatres stands for the proposition that, \nwhere legal and equitable claims are grounded in the \nsame set of facts, the right to a jury trial on the legal \nclaims should prevail, precluding a prior determina-\ntion of the equitable claims. This \u201cgeneral prudential \nrule,\u201d Parklane Hosiery, 439 U.S. at 334, is primarily \nconcerned with the collateral estoppel or res judicata \neffect that an inverse ordering would present, id. See \nalso Katchen v. Landy, 382 U.S. 323, 339\u201340 (1966) \n(explaining that Beacon Theatres announced an \u201cequi-\ntable doctrine,\u201d not a bright-line rule). Consequently, \n\n39 \n \nall order-of-trial problems should, \u201cwherever possi-\nble,\u201d be resolved in favor of granting a jury trial to pre-\nserve the Seventh Amendment right. Beacon Thea-\ntres, 359 U.S. at 510. The resolution of an exhaustion \nquestion, however, does not present such a scenario.  \nBeacon Theatres involved a dispute between two \ntheatres regarding the validity of contracts in which \nthe film distributors had given one of the theatres, \nFox, the exclusive right to show \u201cfirst run pictures\u201d in \nthe area. Id. at 502. Because another theatre, Beacon, \n\u201cnotified Fox that it considered [the] contracts . . . to \nbe overt acts in violation of antitrust laws,\u201d id., Fox \nfiled suit seeking both declaratory judgment and an \ninjunction against Beacon asserting an antitrust \nclaim against it. Id. at 502\u201303. Beacon then filed a \ncounterclaim and cross-claim that the contracts vio-\nlated antitrust laws and requested treble damages. Id. \nat 503. Despite an issue of common fact among the \ncomplaint and counterclaim and Beacon\u2019s request for \na jury trial on legal issues, the district court ordered \nFox\u2019s claims, which were traditional suits in equity, to \nbe tried by the court before a determination of Bea-\ncon\u2019s claims. Id. at 503\u201304. The court of appeals af-\nfirmed, holding that the district judge could try the \nequitable claim first, even if it might preclude a jury \ntrial on the legal claims. Id. at 505.  \nThis Court disagreed. Reasoning that trying the \nequitable claims first could, by way of collateral estop-\npel or res judicata, bar a subsequent trial on the mer-\nits of Beacon\u2019s legal claims, the Court held that order-\nof-trial problems be resolved in favor of granting a \njury trial unless there are \u201cimperative circumstances, \ncircumstances which in view of the flexible procedures \n\n40 \n \nof the Federal Rules we cannot now anticipate.\u201d Id. at \n508; see id. at 504 (\u201c[I]f Beacon would have been enti-\ntled to a jury trial in a treble damage suit against Fox, \nit cannot be deprived of the right merely because Fox \ntook advantage of the availability of declaratory relief \nto sue Beacon first.\u201d); see also Parklane Hosiery, 439 \nU.S. at 333 (\u201cRecognition that an equitable determi-\nnation could have collateral-estoppel effect in a subse-\nquent legal action was the major premise of . . . Beacon \nTheatres.\u201d).  \nDairy Queen, decided three years later, involved \nsimilar timing concerns. There, the claims were both \nlegal (monetary damages for breach of contract) and \nequitable (relief in the form of injunction), and the dis-\ntrict court denied the defendants\u2019 demand for a jury \ntrial on the ground that the jury claim was only \u201cinci-\ndental\u201d to the non-jury claim. 369 U.S. at 470. This \nCourt, relying on Beacon Theatres, explained that \u201cthe \nright to trial by jury may [not] be lost as to legal issues \nwhere those are characterized as \u2018incidental\u2019 to equi-\ntable issues.\u201d Id. Again, the Court was concerned with \nthe preclusive effect that a determination on equitable \nissues would have on legal ones. Id. at 472\u201373. \nBeacon Theatres is therefore instructive in deter-\nmining the order of trial on merits-based arguments. \nWhere a party has a right to a jury trial on a legal \nclaim, the order of trial should be arranged to preserve \nthat right. This is consistent with \u201c[t]he limitation im-\nposed by the [Seventh] [A]mendment . . . that the ul-\ntimate determination of issues of fact by the jury be \nnot interfered with.\u201d In re Peterson, 253 U.S. at 310 \n(emphasis added); see also Markman, 517 U.S. at 377 \n(asking \u201cwhether a particular issue . . . is itself \n\n41 \n \nnecessarily a jury issue, the guarantee being essential \nto preserve the right to a jury\u2019s resolution of the ulti-\nmate dispute\u201d). \nExhaustion questions, whether intertwined with \nthe merits or not, do not raise the same concerns as \nthose in Beacon Theatres for two interrelated reasons. \nFirst, unlike the substantive claims in Beacon Thea-\ntres, exhaustion is a threshold precondition to reach-\ning the merits. Second, unlike the concerns of collat-\neral estoppel or res judicata in Beacon Theatres, a \njudge\u2019s factual findings on exhaustion would not pre-\nclude a jury\u2019s ability to consider those same facts when \ndetermining the merits of the legal claim.  \n1. The presumption does not apply be-\ncause exhaustion is a threshold issue \nthat is logically precedent to the mer-\nits.  \nBeacon Theatres involved competing causes of ac-\ntion\u2014claims for declaratory and injunctive relief on \nthe one hand and claims for treble damages on the \nother. Under the historical equity-first order of opera-\ntions, see Liberty Oil Co., 260 U.S. at 242, the latter \nmerits claims would have been bound by the determi-\nnation of the former and thus never tried before a jury. \nThis Court held that this would violate the Seventh \nAmendment.  \nNo such scenario is present here. Unlike the \nclaims at issue in Beacon Theatres, exhaustion is a \nthreshold precondition to suit that, by its nature, \nmust be determined before the merits. Given that it is \na rule of \u201corderly\u201d procedure, Sing Tuck, 194 U.S. at \n\n42 \n \n168, \u201c[u]ntil the issue of exhaustion is resolved, a \ncourt cannot know whether it is to decide the case or \nthe prison authorities are to,\u201d Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741. \nSee also Perez v. Wis. Dep\u2019t of Corr., 182 F.3d 532, 534 \n(7th Cir. 1999) (explaining that exhaustion is \u201cde-\nsigned to prevent [a] decision on the merits\u201d). To do \notherwise would flip exhaustion on its head\u2014defer-\nence to agency authority would be bypassed and judi-\ncial efficiency lost. See McCarthy, 503 U.S. at 145; Pe-\nrez, 182 F.3d at 534 (explaining that \u201c[e]xamining the \nmerits first and then ordering a case dismissed on ex-\nhaustion grounds . . . would disregard the statutory \napproach\u201d).  \nBecause exhaustion is a threshold issue, it does \nnot have any bearing on a prisoner\u2019s jury trial right. \nIndeed, \u201c \u2018[t]he Seventh Amendment does not confer \nthe right to a trial, but only the right to have a jury \nhear the case once it is determined that the litigation \nshould proceed before a court.\u2019 \u201d Caley, 428 F.3d at \n1372 (quoting Am. Heritage Life Ins. Co., 294 F.3d at \n711); see also Sydnor v. Conseco Fin. Serv. Corp., 252 \nF.3d 302, 307 (4th Cir. 2001) (same). In contrast to \nBeacon Theatres, in which there were competing equi-\ntable and legal causes of action, exhaustion presents \na threshold precondition to suit. Legal claims that are \nsubject to trial by jury may be tried by that jury only \nafter determination of the threshold issue. Beacon \nTheatres is therefore distinguishable and does not \ncompel a different result.  \n\n43 \n \n2. The presumption does not apply be-\ncause a judge\u2019s factual findings re-\ngarding exhaustion would not pre-\nclude a jury\u2019s consideration of the \nsame facts when determining the \nmerits of the legal claim.  \nThis case differs from Beacon Theatres for a sec-\nond reason. A jury can reexamine factual determina-\ntion made by a judge regarding exhaustion when de-\nciding the merits of the claim.  \nBoth Beacon Theatres and Dairy Queen involved \ncircumstances in which the right to a jury trial on a \nlegal issue would be lost through the determination of \nan equitable issue. And Beacon Theatres itself recog-\nnized that there would be cases in which a trial court \nhas \u201cdiscretion in deciding whether the legal or equi-\ntable cause should be tried first,\u201d 359 U.S. at 510, \nkeeping in mind that this discretion \u201cmust, wherever \npossible, be exercised to preserve jury trial.\u201d Id. See \nalso Markman, 517 U.S. at 377 (asking whether the \njury must hear this question to \u201cpreserve the \u2018sub-\nstance of the common-law right of trial by jury\u2019 \u201d) \n(quoting Tull, 481 U.S. at 426) (emphasis omitted). \nHere, that right can be preserved through a jury\u2019s \nability to reexamine the fact questions common to ex-\nhaustion and the underlying legal claim at trial. As \nexplained in Pavey:  \n[A]ny finding that the judge makes, relating \nto exhaustion, that might affect the merits \nmay be reexamined by the jury if\u2014and only \nafter\u2014the prisoner overcomes the exhaustion \ndefense and the case proceeds to the merits. \n544 F.3d at 742.  \n\n44 \n \nThis approach is consistent with the \u201cflexible\u201d na-\nture of collateral estoppel. Duvall v. Att\u2019y Gen. of the \nUnited States, 436 F.3d 382, 390 (3d Cir. 2006) \n(\u201cCourts and commentators have consistently recog-\nnized that collateral estoppel was borne of equity and \nis therefore \u2018flexible,\u2019 bending to satisfy its underlying \npurpose in light of the nature of the proceedings.\u201d) (ci-\ntation omitted); United States v. Stauffer Chem. Co., \n464 U.S. 165, 176 (1984) (White, J., concurring) (ex-\nplaining that collateral estoppel \u201cis a flexible, judge-\nmade doctrine\u201d). Cf. Parklane Hosiery, 439 U.S. at 331 \n(explaining that trial courts have \u201cbroad discretion\u201d in \ndetermining \nwhen \noffensive \ncollateral \nestoppel \n\u201cshould be applied\u201d). \nPavey\u2019s pragmatic approach disposes of the pri-\nmary concern at issue in Beacon Theatres and Dairy \nQueen\u2014namely, that the \u201cright to a jury trial of legal \nissues [would] be lost through prior determination of \nequitable claims.\u201d 359 U.S. at 511 (citation omitted). \nFollowing Pavey\u2019s approach, \u201c[i]f and when the judge \ndetermines that the prisoner has properly exhausted \nhis administrative remedies, the case will proceed to \npretrial discovery, and if necessary a trial, on the mer-\nits[.]\u201d 544 F.3d at 742; see also id. at 741 (explaining \nthat \u201cin many cases the only consequence of a failure \nto exhaust is that the prisoner must go back to the \nbottom rung of the administrative ladder\u201d).4 Then, \u201cif \nthere is a jury trial, the jury will make all necessary \nfindings of fact without being bound by (or even \n \n4 This approach also allays the concerns in Fireman\u2019s Fund, \nwhich the Sixth Circuit relied on below, that \u201cthe merits of a con-\ntroversy could be summarily decided\u201d \u201cwithout the ordinary inci-\ndents of trial.\u201d 253 F.2d at 784 (citing Smithers v. Smith, 204 \nU.S. 632, 645 (1907)).  \n\n45 \n \ninformed of) any of the findings made by the district \njudge in determining that the prisoner had exhausted \nhis administrative remedies.\u201d5 Id. In short, the \u201csub-\nstance of the common-law right of trial by jury\u201d is pre-\nserved. Colgrove, 413 U.S. at 156.  \nOf course, some prisoners will be unable to refile \ntheir lawsuit after a judge\u2019s determination that they \nfailed to properly exhaust administrative remedies. \nSee Pavey, 544 F.3d at 742 (explaining that where a \njudge decides that \u201cthe failure to exhaust was the pris-\noner\u2019s fault . . . the case is over\u201d). But this is simply a \nconsequence of the exhaustion requirement function-\ning as intended. See, e.g., Woodford, 548 U.S. at 89\u2013\n92 (discussing the purposes of exhaustion); id. at 95 \n(\u201cA prisoner who does not want to participate in the \nprison grievance system will have little incentive to \ncomply with the system\u2019s procedural rules unless non-\ncompliance carries a sanction.\u201d). And again, this con-\nsequence has no bearing on the Seventh Amendment, \nwhich guarantees a jury trial only after it is deter-\nmined that the case belongs in court.  \n \n5 As recognized in Pavey, the ability of a prisoner to refile a case \nafter proper exhaustion \u201cdistinguishes the issue of exhaustion \nfrom [other] deadline lines issues that juries decide.\u201d Id. at 741. \nFor example, \u201c[a] statute of limitations defense if successfully in-\nterposed ends the litigation rather than shunting it to another \nforum.\u201d Id.; see also Messa, 652 F.3d at 309\u201310 (explaining that \nthe doctrines of exhaustion and statutes of limitations \u201cplay . . . \nimportant\u2014and distinct\u2014roles in our system of justice\u201d) (cita-\ntion omitted).  \n\n46 \n \nB. Unlike in Beacon Theatres, a judicial de-\ntermination of exhaustion would imple-\nment congressional intent.  \nEven assuming Beacon Theatres applies generally \nto threshold issues that would not implicate the jury\u2019s \nultimate determination of the merits, its presumption \nshould not apply in the PLRA exhaustion context.  \nPost-Beacon Theatres, this Court has noted the \nlimitations of its order-of-trial presumption. In \nKatchen, for example, the Court explained that \u201c[b]oth \nBeacon Theatres and Dairy Queen recognize that \nthere might be situations in which the Courts could \nproceed to resolve the equitable claims first even \nthough the results might be dispositive of the issues \ninvolved in the legal claim.\u201d 382 U.S. at 339 (emphasis \nadded). The Katchen Court addressed \u201cthe mode of \nprocedure for trying out the issue\u201d of voidable prefer-\nences against an estate in bankruptcy proceedings. \n382 U.S. at 325, 326. Recognizing the equitable juris-\ndiction of bankruptcy courts and the \u201cspecific statu-\ntory scheme contemplating the prompt trial of a dis-\nputed claim but without the intervention of a jury,\u201d \nthis Court permitted a bankruptcy court to decide the \npreference issues in an equitable proceeding notwith-\nstanding the argument that it would \u201crender unneces-\nsary a trial in a [legal] action.\u201d Id. at 336, 339. The \nCourt rejected the petitioner\u2019s reliance on Beacon The-\natres and Dairy Queen, noting that the rule of those \ncases \u201cis itself an equitable doctrine\u201d and that appli-\ncation of the rule would \u201cdismember a scheme which \nCongress has prescribed.\u201d Id. at 339; see also id. at \n339\u201340 (\u201cBoth Beacon Theatres and Dairy Queen rec-\nognize that there might be situations in which the \nCourt could proceed to resolve the equitable claim \n\n47 \n \nfirst even though the results might be dispositive of \nthe issues involved in the legal claim.\u201d); but see Gran-\nfinanciera, 492 U.S. at 58\u201359 (noting the limitations \non the scope of Congress\u2019s ability to \u201cdivest [parties] of \ntheir Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial\u201d).  \nAs in Katchen, this case involves a specific statu-\ntory scheme whose purpose would be compromised ab-\nsent prompt resolution of disputed facts by the court. \nSee Katchen, 383 U.S. at 339. Congress passed the \nPLRA \u201cto reduce the quantity and improve the quality \nof prisoner suits.\u201d Porter, 534 U.S. at 524. The \u201cinvig-\norated\u201d exhaustion requirements is the \u201ccenterpiece\u201d \nof this legislation, Woodford, 548 U.S. at 84, and it \nserves dual purposes. It allows prisons to rectify their \nown mistakes before they are \u201chaled into federal \ncourt,\u201d id. at 89, and promotes judicial efficiency by \nreducing litigation and creating an administrative \nrecord for the litigation that does occur, id. \nAllowing potentially unexhausted claims to pro-\nceed to a jury trial subverts both purposes. See also \nPart I(B)(4). This subversion is further reason why the \nprudential rule set forth in Beacon Theatres should \nnot apply to PLRA exhaustion.  \nThat an exhaustion question is intertwined with \nthe merits of a prisoner\u2019s claim does not transform ex-\nhaustion into a jury-triable issue. Exhaustion is a \nthreshold issue that is logically precedent to the mer-\nits. And Beacon Theatres\u2019 presumption would not ap-\nply where any judicial determination of overlapping \nfacts remains subject to later review by a jury in a trial \non the merits. Finally, that a judicial determination of  \n \n \n\n48 \n \nexhaustion would implement congressional intent \nserves as yet another reason why Beacon Theatres\u2019 \nprudential rule should not apply to exhaustion ques-\ntions. \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be  \nreversed.  \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nAnn M.

Because he \nalleges that their retaliation included destroying his \nprison grievances and preventing him from utilizing \nthe grievance process, the question of whether he \nfailed to exhaust available administrative remedies \nis inextricably intertwined with the core merits of \nhis claim. This is a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim for money \ndamages, so the Seventh Amendment clearly gives \nMr. Richards a right to jury trial on the merits of his \nclaims.  Nonetheless, the magistrate judge conducted \na bench trial, heard evidence from both sides, found \nas a fact that the testimony of Respondent and his \nco-plaintiffs was not credible, and recommended \ndismissal on the ground that they failed to exhaust \navailable \nprison \nremedies. \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt \naccepted that recommendation. \n \nThe Sixth Circuit correctly held that this process \nviolated \nthe \nSeventh \nAmendment, \ngiven \nthe \nsubstantial overlap between the factual disputes \nrelated to exhaustion and the actual merits of \nRichards\u2019 claims. In so doing, and as the petition \nexplains, the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision created an \nacknowledged circuit split with the Seventh Circuit\u2019s \ndecision in Pavey v. Conley, 544 F.3d 739 (7th Cir. \n2008). The en banc Ninth Circuit has also endorsed \nthe relevant holding of Pavey in Albino v. Baca, 747 \nF.3d 1162, 1171 (9th Cir. 2014) (en banc), though the \nSixth Circuit characterized the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \nlanguage as dicta. Pet. App. 14a. On the other side of \n\n2 \n \n \nthe equation, several district courts in the Second \nCircuit have like, the Sixth Circuit, disagreed with \nPavey.  \n \nNonetheless, review of this shallow split would \nbe premature. The Sixth Circuit is clearly right\u2014\nand the Seventh and Ninth Circuits clearly wrong\u2014\non the Seventh Amendment question. Indeed, there \nare strong arguments that the Seventh Amendment \ndoes not permit judicial resolution of facts related to \nexhaustion \neven \nwhen \nthose \nfacts \nare \nnot \nintertwined with the merits. When the facts are \nintertwined, it is black-letter law that judges should \ndefer to juries even as to facts (like amount-in-\ncontroversy) that also bear on subject matter \njurisdiction. Several circuits that generally permit \njudge resolution of exhaustion questions have \nreserved decision on whether a different rule might \nbe necessary when those facts are intertwined with \nthe merits. There is every reason to expect that \nthose circuits will ultimately side with the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s cogent analysis in this case and reject the \nSeventh Circuit\u2019s puzzling and illogical Pavey \ndecision. Indeed the Seventh and Ninth Circuits may \nwell reconsider the question en banc without this \nCourt\u2019s intervention. \n \nThe petition argues at length that convening a \njury to decide factual disputes bearing on exhaustion \nof remedies would defeat Congress\u2019s intent to \nstreamline \nprisoner \nlitigation \nin \nthe \nPrison \nLitigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d). It says time and \nagain that early bench trial resolution of exhaustion \nquestions is necessary to bar \u201cfrivolous claims at the \nearliest possible juncture.\u201d  Pet. at 2; see also id. at 9, \n16. But the PLRA\u2019s actual pre-screening provision, \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, notably does not provide for such \n\n3 \n \n \na procedure. The Sixth Circuit here also ruled that \nRichards\u2019 \u201cserious and detailed allegations cannot \nreasonably be considered frivolous,\u201d Pet. App. 8a, \nand observed that the defendant did \u201cnot directly \ncontest whether his alleged actions were motivated \nby Richards\u2019s protected conduct.\u201d  96 F.4th at 918\u2013\n19.  The petition challenges neither ruling.   \n \nThis Court has repeatedly rejected arguments \nlike these suggesting that the PLRA sets up \nexhaustion as some kind of special and jurisdictional \nprecondition to suit. See, e.g., Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. \n199, 216 (2007) (\u201cfailure to exhaust is an affirmative \ndefense under the PLRA\u201d); see also Woodford v. Ngo, \n548 U.S. 81, 101 (2006) (concluding that \u201cthe PLRA \nexhaustion requirement is not jurisdictional\u201d). The \nproblem of intertwined exhaustion and merits \nfactual disputes also is presented only in a subset of \nPLRA cases.  And in any event the question is not \nwhether jury resolution of disputed facts can be \nsquared with a statute\u2019s purpose, but rather whether \nthat statute\u2019s application can be squared with the \nConstitution. As this Court has repeatedly made \nclear, questions about Congress\u2019s intent must take a \nback-seat to the historic role of the jury at common \nlaw. Yet Michigan would hand Congress the keys to \nthe car and strap the Seventh Amendment to the \nroof. This Court should decline that invitation. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n4 \n \n \nI. THE \nSIXTH \nCIRCUIT\u2019S \nDECISION \nIS \n \nCLEARLY CORRECT \n \nA. \nThe \nSixth \nCircuit \nCorrectly \nRecognized That Facts Intertwined \nWith The Merits Should Always Be \nDecided By Juries  \n \nThe petition argues that a factual dispute about \nexhaustion is just a \u201cthreshold issue to determine \nwhether \na \nprisoner \nhas \nmet \na \nprocedural \nrequirement to take his or her case to a jury,\u201d and \nthat therefore the Seventh Amendment is not \nimplicated by analogy to other threshold issues like \nabstention and venue. Pet. 19. These arguments \nmirror Judge Posner\u2019s \u201cgeneralization\u201d in Pavey that \n\u201c[j]uries decide cases, not issues of judicial traffic \ncontrol.\u201d 544 F.3d at 741. But they bear little \nresemblance to an actual Seventh Amendment \nanalysis. \n \nUnder this Court\u2019s precedents, \u00a7 1983\u2014the \nfoundation of Richards\u2019s action\u2014is clearly analogous \nto causes of action that were \u201ctried at law at the time \nof the founding.\u201d Markman v. Westview Instruments, \nInc., 517 U.S. 370, 376 (1996); City of Monterey v. Del \nMonte Dunes at Monterey, Ltd., 526 U.S. 687, 718 \n(1999). So the precise Seventh Amendment question \nis \u201cwhether the particular trial decision,\u201d a factual \ndispute about exhaustion that overlaps with the \nmerits, \u201cmust fall to the jury in order to preserve the \nsubstance of the common-law right as it existed in \n1791.\u201d Markman, 517 U.S. at 376. To figure that out, \n\u201cwe look to history to determine whether the \nparticular issues, or analogous ones, were decided by \njudge or by jury in suits at common law at the time \n\n5 \n \n \nthe Seventh Amendment was adopted.\u201d Del Monte \nDunes, 526 U.S. at 718. And \u201cwhere history does not \nprovide a clear answer, we look to precedent and \nfunctional considerations.\u201d Id. \nThe Sixth Circuit rightly acknowledged that \nunder this Court\u2019s precedents \u201c\u2018many procedural \ndevices developed since 1791 that have diminished the \ncivil jury\u2019s historic domain,\u2019\u201d such as directed verdicts \nand summary judgment, \u201c\u2018have been found not to be \ninconsistent with the Seventh Amendment.\u2019\u201d Pet. App. \n16a-17a (quoting Parklane Hosiery Co., Inc. v. Shore, \n439 U.S. 322, 336 (1979)). But it then recognized the \nkey distinction between those devices and what \nhappened here: none of them \u201cpermit a judge to decide \ngenuine disputes of material fact at a preliminary \nstage of the case that would normally be reserved for \nthe jury.\u201d Pet. App. 17a. The magistrate judge\u2019s \nfactfinding in this case\u2014including explicit credibility \ndeterminations\u2014directly invaded the merits and \n\u201cstripped [Richards] of his \u2018right to a jury\u2019s resolution \nof the ultimate dispute.\u2019\u201d Pet. App. 17a (quoting \nMarkman, 517 U.S. at 377).  \nTo buttress the point, the Sixth Circuit cited its \nlongstanding holding that factual disputes about the \namount in controversy should be deferred to the jury \non the merits in diversity cases, even though that \nissue also has implications for subject matter \njurisdiction. See Pet. App. 17a-18a; Fireman\u2019s Fund \nInsurance Co v. Railway Express Agency, 253 F.2d \n780 (6th Cir. 1958). Because \u201cFireman\u2019s Fund \nrequires that certain cases be heard and determined \non the merits even when constitutionally implicated \njurisdictional disputes might procedurally terminate \nthe proceedings,\u201d the court explained, \u201cwe are all the \nmore convinced that the result should be the same \n\n6 \n \n \nwhen the lesser concern of an affirmative defense, \nsuch as the PLRA\u2019s requirement to exhaust \nadministrative remedies, implicates the merits of a \nclaim.\u201d Pet. App. 19a. After all, \u201c[u]nlike exhaustion, \nan absence of subject-matter jurisdiction implicates \na federal court\u2019s ability to even hear the case.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 19a. Fireman\u2019s Fund also explains why its \nholding is not inconsistent with the general rule that \njudges ordinarily are allowed to hear evidence and to \ndetermine facts necessary to the court\u2019s jurisdiction: \n\u201csuch hearings usually involve factual issues \npertaining only to the question of jurisdiction, not \nincluding factual issues which would be decisive of \nthe merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claim.\u201d 253 F.2d at 784. \nThe petition criticizes the Sixth Circuit\u2019s reliance \non Fireman\u2019s Fund on the ground that \u201cthe case did \nnot discuss or rely on the Seventh Amendment.\u201d Pet. \n20. That is only superficially true. Fireman\u2019s Fund \nrelied on this Court\u2019s decision in Smithers v. Smith, \n204 U.S. 632 (1907), which similarly held that a \ndispute about amount in controversy should be \ndeferred to a jury trial when that issue is intertwined \nwith the merits. And Smithers clearly does rely on \nSeventh Amendment principles, at least in part. This \nCourt explained that judicial discretion to find \njurisdictional facts \u201cobviously is not unlimited, . . . lest \nunder the guise of determining jurisdiction, the merits \nof the controversy between the parties be summarily \ndecided without the ordinary incidents of a trial, \nincluding the right to a jury.\u201d 204 U.S. at 645 \n(emphasis added). \u201cFor it must not be forgotten,\u201d this \nCourt wrote, \u201cthat where, in good faith, one has \nbrought into court a cause of action which, as stated \nby him, is clearly within its jurisdiction, he has the \nright to try its merits in the manner provided by the \n\n7 \n \n \nConstitution and law, and cannot be compelled to \nsubmit to a trial of another kind.\u201d Id. \nFireman\u2019s Fund also relied on this Court\u2019s \nopinion in Land v. Dollar, 330 U.S. 731 (1947), \nwhich considered a suit by a steamship company\u2019s \nstockholders against the U.S. Maritime Commission \nto recover stock previously given to the Commission. \nThis Court held that the district court erred in \ndeciding a jurisdictional sovereign immunity question, \nbecause \u201cthis is the type of case where the question of \njurisdiction is dependent on decision of the merits.\u201d \n330 U.S. at 735. \u201c[I]f the allegations of the petition \n[were] true, the shares of stock never were property of \nthe United States,\u201d so the district court had \n\u201cjurisdiction to determine its jurisdiction\u201d and should \ninstead have \u201cproceed[ed] to a decision on the merits.\u201d \nId. at 738\u201339. Land v. Dollar does not explicitly \ninvoke the right to jury trial, but the principles it \nrelied on are plainly intended to protect that right. \nIt is longstanding black letter law that \u201c[i]n a case \nin which there is a right to jury trial, a dismissal for \nlack of jurisdiction that improperly summarily decides \nthe substantive issues also violates the parties\u2019 \nSeventh Amendment rights.\u201d 8 Moore\u2019s Federal \nPractice \u00a7 38.34[1][c][i] (3d ed. 2009) (\u201cTrial on Merits \nRequired \nWhen \nJurisdictional \nDetermination \nDepends on Determination of Merits.\u201d).1 Factual \n                                                 \n1 See also 5C Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \n\u00a7 1350 (3d ed. 2004) (\u201cThe court may postpone a decision until \nevidence is submitted at trial if the jurisdictional issue is \nintertwined with the merits of the case.\u201d); Joshua S. Moskovitz, \nNote, The Usual Practice: Raising and Deciding Failure to \nExhaust Administrative Remedies as an Affirmative Defense \nunder the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 31 Cardozo L. Rev. 1859, \n1899 n.248 (2010) (Moskovitz) (collecting sources).  \n\n8 \n \n \nquestions bearing on both personal jurisdiction and \nvenue are also reserved for trial and submitted to the \njury when they are intertwined with the core merits of \nthe case.2 And in the related context of civil actions \npresenting both legal and equitable claims, this Court \nhas consistently held that the jury trial right cannot \n\u201cbe impaired by any blending with a claim, properly \ncognizable at law, of a demand for equitable relief in \naid of the legal action, or during its pendency.\u201d Scott v. \nNeely, 140 U.S. 106, 109\u201310 (1891); see also Ross v. \nBernhard, 396 U.S. 531, 537\u201338, 538 n.10 (1970) \n(\u201c[W]here equitable and legal claims are joined in the \nsame action, [the] right to jury trial on the legal \nclaims . . . must not be infringed.\u201d). \nThe rule that factual issues bearing on the merits \nmust always be decided by a jury has very deep roots. \nAt common law, defendants could dispute a plaintiff\u2019s \ndeclaration (i.e., complaint) by either demurrer or \nplea. John Jay McKelvey, Principles of Common-Law \nPleading \u00a7 93, at 68\u201369 (1894) (McKelvey). A \ndemurrer, like a modern-day 12(b)(6) or purely legal \n12(b)(1) motion, accepted the facts as alleged and \n\u201craise[d] a question of law for the determination of the \ncourt\u201d about the declaration\u2019s sufficiency. Benjamin J. \n                                                 \n2 See, e.g., Brown v. Slenker, 220 F.3d 411, 419 (5th Cir. 2000) \n(\u201c[Personal j]urisdiction remains intertwined with the merits, and \non remand both must be decided at a new trial, based on valid \njury findings.\u201d); Kierulff Assocs. v. Luria Bros. & Co., 240 F. Supp. \n640, 642 (S.D.N.Y. 1965) (\u201cWhere venue and the merits of an \naction are intertwined, it is often better to wait until trial where a \nfull presentation of the issue can be made, rather than rule \npreliminarily on a motion.\u201d); Fastener Corp. v. Spotnails, Inc., 291 \nF. Supp. 974, 976 (N.D. Ill. 1968) (\u201c[T]he venue question merge[d] \nwith the issue of infringement on the merits . . . .\u201d).  \n\n9 \n \n \nShipman, Handbook of Common-Law Pleading \u00a7\u00a7 8\u20139, \nat 28 (3d ed. 1923) (Shipman).  \nAs an alternative to the demurrer, there were \nvarious types of pleas. The plea in traverse denied the \ndeclaration\u2019s factual allegations and triggered a jury \ntrial. \u201cWhere an allegation is traversed, or denied, it is \nevident that a question is at once raised between the \nparties; and it is a question of fact . . . .\u201d Shipman \n\u00a7 167, at 302; see also Richard Ross Perry, Common-\nLaw Pleading: Its History and Principles 179\u201380 \n(1897) (Perry). \u201c[T]he tender and acceptance of an \nissue of fact close[d] all pleading in the action, as there \n[was] then nothing left but a trial, which [disposed] of \nthe action on its merits.\u201d Shipman \u00a7 15, at 32\u201333.  \nThe common law permitted various other types of \npleas\u2014such as a plea in abatement or plea in bar\u2014\nthat might raise legal or factual issues collateral to \nthe merits. But critically, if any such plea actually \ncontradicted the factual allegations of the plaintiff\u2019s \ndeclaration, the common law would have regarded it \nas a traverse and proceeded immediately to a trial by \njury. \u201cThe word traverse . . . is synonymous with the \nword denial. Where the defendant intends to rely for \nhis defense upon the fact that the allegations \ncontained in the declaration as to the subject matter of \nthe action are untrue, he must put in the plea known \nas a traverse.\u201d McKelvey \u00a7 185, at 118; see also Perry, \nat 275. Therefore in a case (like this one) where the \nfacts relevant to a threshold defect were intertwined \nwith the merits, it would not even have been possible \nto frame the issue for a purely judicial decision at \ncommon law. \nThe petition argues that a bench trial before a \nmagistrate judge gave Mr. Richards many of the other \nimportant protections of a trial, such as a right to \n\n10 \n \n \npresent \nevidence \nand \ncross \nexamine \nopposing \nwitnesses. Pet. 20-21. No doubt those rights are \nimportant. But the right to trial by jury in civil cases \nis separately and specially protected by the Seventh \nAmendment. This Court recently recognized that \n\u201cthe right to trial by jury is \u2018of such importance and \noccupies so firm a place in our history and \njurisprudence that any seeming curtailment of the \nright has always been and \u2018should be scrutinized \nwith the utmost case.\u2019\u201d SEC v. Jarkesy, Slip Op. at 7 \n(2024) (quoting Dimick v. Schiedt, 293 U.S. 474, 486 \n(1935)). And that is by no means a newfound \nsentiment: Justice Story once explained that the civil \njury trial right is \u201cjustly dear to the American \npeople. It has always been an object of deep interest \nand solicitude, and every encroachment upon it has \nbeen watched with great jealousy.\u201d Parsons v. \nBedford, Breedlove & Robeson, 28 U.S. 433, 466 \n(1830). The Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision is entirely \nconsistent with that tradition. \n \n \nB. \nThe Seventh Circuit\u2019s Decision In \n \nPavey Makes No Sense  \nThe Seventh and Ninth Circuit decisions, by \ncontrast, do not genuinely grapple with the Seventh \nAmendment problem and clearly get the answer \nwrong.  \nJudge Posner\u2019s opinion in Pavey takes for \ngranted that questions of subject matter jurisdiction \n\u201coften . . . turn[] on factual issues that may be \ngenuinely debatable, but even if so the issues are \nresolved by the judge,\u201d without recognizing that an \nopposite rule applies when jurisdictional facts are \nintertwined with the merits. Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741. \nThe Pavey opinion then leaps from the observation \n\n11 \n \n \nthat judges sometimes are permitted to decide \nquestions of fact relevant to preliminary threshold \nissues to an entirely unwarranted \u201cgeneralization\u201d \nthat juries do not decide any questions that can be \ncharacterized as matters of \u201cjudicial traffic control.\u201d \nId.  \nIn reaching that conclusion, Pavey wrongly \ncharacterizes exhaustion as just an issue of \u201cjudicial \ntraffic control\u201d on the naked assertion that \u201cin many \ncases\u201d exhaustion is simply a question of the choice \nof forum because \u201cthe only consequence of a failure \nto exhaust is that the prisoner must go back to the \nbottom rung of the administrative ladder.\u201d Id. \u201cThat \ndistinguishes the issue of exhaustion from deadline \nissues that juries decide,\u201d the Seventh Circuit \nreasoned, because \u201c[a] statute of limitations defense \nif successfully interposed ends the litigation rather \nthan shunting it to another forum.\u201d The Seventh \nCircuit acknowledged, however, that in that actual \ncase the defendant \u201cwould no longer have any \nadministrative remedies\u201d if the exhaustion issue was \nresolved against him, so the issue was entirely \ndispositive of the merits. Id. Surely this Court \nunderstands that that will almost always be true in \nPLRA cases. Prisons have grievance and appeal \nprocesses with extremely tight filing windows\u2014\nmeasured in days. By the time an exhaustion issue \nis raised in federal court, those deadlines will \ngenerally be years in the past and will make it \nimpossible for the plaintiff to go back and seek \nfurther exhaustion. See Alison M. Mikkor, Correcting \nfor Bias and Blind Spots in PLRA Exhaustion Law, \n21 George Mason L. Rev. 573, 584 (2014) (\u201cIn the \nlast few years, many corrections departments have \nalso reduced the amount of time within which a \n\n12 \n \n \nprisoner must file her initial grievance and any \nsubsequent appeals.  In the light of the deference \nshown to [these internal] rules in the PLRA \nexhaustion analysis, this reduction means that for \nprisoners in some systems there is effectively only a \ntwo- or three-day statute of limitations on their \nconstitutional claims.\u201d) (footnotes omitted).   \nFinally, the Seventh Circuit reasoned that, \u201c[b]y \nanalogy to the cases that require that claims at law \nbe decided before equitable claims when both types \nof claim are presented,\u201d a jury later hearing the case \non the merits would not be bound by any exhaustion \nfindings the judge made. Id. at 742. But as the Sixth \nCircuit correctly explained, that line of reasoning \n\u201crings hollow\u201d because \u201cif the prisoner\u2019s case is \ndismissed for failure to exhaust his or her \nadministrative remedies\u201d then \u201ca jury would never \nbe assembled to resolve the factual disputes\u201d on the \nmerits. Pet. App. 15a. \nIn Albino v. Baca, the en banc Ninth Circuit \nappeared to embrace Pavey, with the court noting \nthat \u201c[w]e agree with the Seventh Circuit that, if a \nfactual finding on a disputed question is relevant \nboth to exhaustion and to the merits, a judge\u2019s \nfinding made in the course of deciding exhaustion is \nnot binding on a jury deciding the merits of the suit.\u201d \n747 F.3d\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Because he \nalleges that their retaliation included destroying his \nprison grievances and preventing him from utilizing \nthe grievance process, the question of whether he \nfailed to exhaust available administrative remedies \nis inextricably intertwined with the core merits of \nhis claim. This is a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim for money \ndamages, so the Seventh Amendment clearly gives \nMr. Richards a right to jury trial on the merits of his \nclaims.  Nonetheless, the magistrate judge conducted \na bench trial, heard evidence from both sides, found \nas a fact that the testimony of Respondent and his \nco-plaintiffs was not credible, and recommended \ndismissal on the ground that they failed to exhaust \navailable \nprison \nremedies. \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt \naccepted that recommendation. \n \nThe Sixth Circuit correctly held that this process \nviolated \nthe \nSeventh \nAmendment, \ngiven \nthe \nsubstantial overlap between the factual disputes \nrelated to exhaustion and the actual merits of \nRichards\u2019 claims. In so doing, and as the petition \nexplains, the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision created an \nacknowledged circuit split with the Seventh Circuit\u2019s \ndecision in Pavey v. Conley, 544 F.3d 739 (7th Cir. \n2008). The en banc Ninth Circuit has also endorsed \nthe relevant holding of Pavey in Albino v. Baca, 747 \nF.3d 1162, 1171 (9th Cir. 2014) (en banc), though the \nSixth Circuit characterized the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \nlanguage as dicta. Pet. App. 14a. On the other side of \n\n2 \n \n \nthe equation, several district courts in the Second \nCircuit have like, the Sixth Circuit, disagreed with \nPavey.  \n \nNonetheless, review of this shallow split would \nbe premature. The Sixth Circuit is clearly right\u2014\nand the Seventh and Ninth Circuits clearly wrong\u2014\non the Seventh Amendment question. Indeed, there \nare strong arguments that the Seventh Amendment \ndoes not permit judicial resolution of facts related to \nexhaustion \neven \nwhen \nthose \nfacts \nare \nnot \nintertwined with the merits. When the facts are \nintertwined, it is black-letter law that judges should \ndefer to juries even as to facts (like amount-in-\ncontroversy) that also bear on subject matter \njurisdiction. Several circuits that generally permit \njudge resolution of exhaustion questions have \nreserved decision on whether a different rule might \nbe necessary when those facts are intertwined with \nthe merits. There is every reason to expect that \nthose circuits will ultimately side with the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s cogent analysis in this case and reject the \nSeventh Circuit\u2019s puzzling and illogical Pavey \ndecision. Indeed the Seventh and Ninth Circuits may \nwell reconsider the question en banc without this \nCourt\u2019s intervention. \n \nThe petition argues at length that convening a \njury to decide factual disputes bearing on exhaustion \nof remedies would defeat Congress\u2019s intent to \nstreamline \nprisoner \nlitigation \nin \nthe \nPrison \nLitigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d). It says time and \nagain that early bench trial resolution of exhaustion \nquestions is necessary to bar \u201cfrivolous claims at the \nearliest possible juncture.\u201d  Pet. at 2; see also id. at 9, \n16. But the PLRA\u2019s actual pre-screening provision, \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, notably does not provide for such \n\n3 \n \n \na procedure. The Sixth Circuit here also ruled that \nRichards\u2019 \u201cserious and detailed allegations cannot \nreasonably be considered frivolous,\u201d Pet. App. 8a, \nand observed that the defendant did \u201cnot directly \ncontest whether his alleged actions were motivated \nby Richards\u2019s protected conduct.\u201d  96 F.4th at 918\u2013\n19.  The petition challenges neither ruling.   \n \nThis Court has repeatedly rejected arguments \nlike these suggesting that the PLRA sets up \nexhaustion as some kind of special and jurisdictional \nprecondition to suit. See, e.g., Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. \n199, 216 (2007) (\u201cfailure to exhaust is an affirmative \ndefense under the PLRA\u201d); see also Woodford v. Ngo, \n548 U.S. 81, 101 (2006) (concluding that \u201cthe PLRA \nexhaustion requirement is not jurisdictional\u201d). The \nproblem of intertwined exhaustion and merits \nfactual disputes also is presented only in a subset of \nPLRA cases.  And in any event the question is not \nwhether jury resolution of disputed facts can be \nsquared with a statute\u2019s purpose, but rather whether \nthat statute\u2019s application can be squared with the \nConstitution. As this Court has repeatedly made \nclear, questions about Congress\u2019s intent must take a \nback-seat to the historic role of the jury at common \nlaw. Yet Michigan would hand Congress the keys to \nthe car and strap the Seventh Amendment to the \nroof. This Court should decline that invitation. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n4 \n \n \nI. THE \nSIXTH \nCIRCUIT\u2019S \nDECISION \nIS \n \nCLEARLY CORRECT \n \nA. \nThe \nSixth \nCircuit \nCorrectly \nRecognized That Facts Intertwined \nWith The Merits Should Always Be \nDecided By Juries  \n \nThe petition argues that a factual dispute about \nexhaustion is just a \u201cthreshold issue to determine \nwhether \na \nprisoner \nhas \nmet \na \nprocedural \nrequirement to take his or her case to a jury,\u201d and \nthat therefore the Seventh Amendment is not \nimplicated by analogy to other threshold issues like \nabstention and venue. Pet. 19. These arguments \nmirror Judge Posner\u2019s \u201cgeneralization\u201d in Pavey that \n\u201c[j]uries decide cases, not issues of judicial traffic \ncontrol.\u201d 544 F.3d at 741. But they bear little \nresemblance to an actual Seventh Amendment \nanalysis. \n \nUnder this Court\u2019s precedents, \u00a7 1983\u2014the \nfoundation of Richards\u2019s action\u2014is clearly analogous \nto causes of action that were \u201ctried at law at the time \nof the founding.\u201d Markman v. Westview Instruments, \nInc., 517 U.S. 370, 376 (1996); City of Monterey v. Del \nMonte Dunes at Monterey, Ltd., 526 U.S. 687, 718 \n(1999). So the precise Seventh Amendment question \nis \u201cwhether the particular trial decision,\u201d a factual \ndispute about exhaustion that overlaps with the \nmerits, \u201cmust fall to the jury in order to preserve the \nsubstance of the common-law right as it existed in \n1791.\u201d Markman, 517 U.S. at 376. To figure that out, \n\u201cwe look to history to determine whether the \nparticular issues, or analogous ones, were decided by \njudge or by jury in suits at common law at the time \n\n5 \n \n \nthe Seventh Amendment was adopted.\u201d Del Monte \nDunes, 526 U.S. at 718. And \u201cwhere history does not \nprovide a clear answer, we look to precedent and \nfunctional considerations.\u201d Id. \nThe Sixth Circuit rightly acknowledged that \nunder this Court\u2019s precedents \u201c\u2018many procedural \ndevices developed since 1791 that have diminished the \ncivil jury\u2019s historic domain,\u2019\u201d such as directed verdicts \nand summary judgment, \u201c\u2018have been found not to be \ninconsistent with the Seventh Amendment.\u2019\u201d Pet. App. \n16a-17a (quoting Parklane Hosiery Co., Inc. v. Shore, \n439 U.S. 322, 336 (1979)). But it then recognized the \nkey distinction between those devices and what \nhappened here: none of them \u201cpermit a judge to decide \ngenuine disputes of material fact at a preliminary \nstage of the case that would normally be reserved for \nthe jury.\u201d Pet. App. 17a. The magistrate judge\u2019s \nfactfinding in this case\u2014including explicit credibility \ndeterminations\u2014directly invaded the merits and \n\u201cstripped [Richards] of his \u2018right to a jury\u2019s resolution \nof the ultimate dispute.\u2019\u201d Pet. App. 17a (quoting \nMarkman, 517 U.S. at 377).  \nTo buttress the point, the Sixth Circuit cited its \nlongstanding holding that factual disputes about the \namount in controversy should be deferred to the jury \non the merits in diversity cases, even though that \nissue also has implications for subject matter \njurisdiction. See Pet. App. 17a-18a; Fireman\u2019s Fund \nInsurance Co v. Railway Express Agency, 253 F.2d \n780 (6th Cir. 1958). Because \u201cFireman\u2019s Fund \nrequires that certain cases be heard and determined \non the merits even when constitutionally implicated \njurisdictional disputes might procedurally terminate \nthe proceedings,\u201d the court explained, \u201cwe are all the \nmore convinced that the result should be the same \n\n6 \n \n \nwhen the lesser concern of an affirmative defense, \nsuch as the PLRA\u2019s requirement to exhaust \nadministrative remedies, implicates the merits of a \nclaim.\u201d Pet. App. 19a. After all, \u201c[u]nlike exhaustion, \nan absence of subject-matter jurisdiction implicates \na federal court\u2019s ability to even hear the case.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 19a. Fireman\u2019s Fund also explains why its \nholding is not inconsistent with the general rule that \njudges ordinarily are allowed to hear evidence and to \ndetermine facts necessary to the court\u2019s jurisdiction: \n\u201csuch hearings usually involve factual issues \npertaining only to the question of jurisdiction, not \nincluding factual issues which would be decisive of \nthe merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claim.\u201d 253 F.2d at 784. \nThe petition criticizes the Sixth Circuit\u2019s reliance \non Fireman\u2019s Fund on the ground that \u201cthe case did \nnot discuss or rely on the Seventh Amendment.\u201d Pet. \n20. That is only superficially true. Fireman\u2019s Fund \nrelied on this Court\u2019s decision in Smithers v. Smith, \n204 U.S. 632 (1907), which similarly held that a \ndispute about amount in controversy should be \ndeferred to a jury trial when that issue is intertwined \nwith the merits. And Smithers clearly does rely on \nSeventh Amendment principles, at least in part. This \nCourt explained that judicial discretion to find \njurisdictional facts \u201cobviously is not unlimited, . . . lest \nunder the guise of determining jurisdiction, the merits \nof the controversy between the parties be summarily \ndecided without the ordinary incidents of a trial, \nincluding the right to a jury.\u201d 204 U.S. at 645 \n(emphasis added). \u201cFor it must not be forgotten,\u201d this \nCourt wrote, \u201cthat where, in good faith, one has \nbrought into court a cause of action which, as stated \nby him, is clearly within its jurisdiction, he has the \nright to try its merits in the manner provided by the \n\n7 \n \n \nConstitution and law, and cannot be compelled to \nsubmit to a trial of another kind.\u201d Id. \nFireman\u2019s Fund also relied on this Court\u2019s \nopinion in Land v. Dollar, 330 U.S. 731 (1947), \nwhich considered a suit by a steamship company\u2019s \nstockholders against the U.S. Maritime Commission \nto recover stock previously given to the Commission. \nThis Court held that the district court erred in \ndeciding a jurisdictional sovereign immunity question, \nbecause \u201cthis is the type of case where the question of \njurisdiction is dependent on decision of the merits.\u201d \n330 U.S. at 735. \u201c[I]f the allegations of the petition \n[were] true, the shares of stock never were property of \nthe United States,\u201d so the district court had \n\u201cjurisdiction to determine its jurisdiction\u201d and should \ninstead have \u201cproceed[ed] to a decision on the merits.\u201d \nId. at 738\u201339. Land v. Dollar does not explicitly \ninvoke the right to jury trial, but the principles it \nrelied on are plainly intended to protect that right. \nIt is longstanding black letter law that \u201c[i]n a case \nin which there is a right to jury trial, a dismissal for \nlack of jurisdiction that improperly summarily decides \nthe substantive issues also violates the parties\u2019 \nSeventh Amendment rights.\u201d 8 Moore\u2019s Federal \nPractice \u00a7 38.34[1][c][i] (3d ed. 2009) (\u201cTrial on Merits \nRequired \nWhen \nJurisdictional \nDetermination \nDepends on Determination of Merits.\u201d).1 Factual \n                                                 \n1 See also 5C Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \n\u00a7 1350 (3d ed. 2004) (\u201cThe court may postpone a decision until \nevidence is submitted at trial if the jurisdictional issue is \nintertwined with the merits of the case.\u201d); Joshua S. Moskovitz, \nNote, The Usual Practice: Raising and Deciding Failure to \nExhaust Administrative Remedies as an Affirmative Defense \nunder the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 31 Cardozo L. Rev. 1859, \n1899 n.248 (2010) (Moskovitz) (collecting sources).  \n\n8 \n \n \nquestions bearing on both personal jurisdiction and \nvenue are also reserved for trial and submitted to the \njury when they are intertwined with the core merits of \nthe case.2 And in the related context of civil actions \npresenting both legal and equitable claims, this Court \nhas consistently held that the jury trial right cannot \n\u201cbe impaired by any blending with a claim, properly \ncognizable at law, of a demand for equitable relief in \naid of the legal action, or during its pendency.\u201d Scott v. \nNeely, 140 U.S. 106, 109\u201310 (1891); see also Ross v. \nBernhard, 396 U.S. 531, 537\u201338, 538 n.10 (1970) \n(\u201c[W]here equitable and legal claims are joined in the \nsame action, [the] right to jury trial on the legal \nclaims . . . must not be infringed.\u201d). \nThe rule that factual issues bearing on the merits \nmust always be decided by a jury has very deep roots. \nAt common law, defendants could dispute a plaintiff\u2019s \ndeclaration (i.e., complaint) by either demurrer or \nplea. John Jay McKelvey, Principles of Common-Law \nPleading \u00a7 93, at 68\u201369 (1894) (McKelvey). A \ndemurrer, like a modern-day 12(b)(6) or purely legal \n12(b)(1) motion, accepted the facts as alleged and \n\u201craise[d] a question of law for the determination of the \ncourt\u201d about the declaration\u2019s sufficiency. Benjamin J. \n                                                 \n2 See, e.g., Brown v. Slenker, 220 F.3d 411, 419 (5th Cir. 2000) \n(\u201c[Personal j]urisdiction remains intertwined with the merits, and \non remand both must be decided at a new trial, based on valid \njury findings.\u201d); Kierulff Assocs. v. Luria Bros. & Co., 240 F. Supp. \n640, 642 (S.D.N.Y. 1965) (\u201cWhere venue and the merits of an \naction are intertwined, it is often better to wait until trial where a \nfull presentation of the issue can be made, rather than rule \npreliminarily on a motion.\u201d); Fastener Corp. v. Spotnails, Inc., 291 \nF. Supp. 974, 976 (N.D. Ill. 1968) (\u201c[T]he venue question merge[d] \nwith the issue of infringement on the merits . . . .\u201d).  \n\n9 \n \n \nShipman, Handbook of Common-Law Pleading \u00a7\u00a7 8\u20139, \nat 28 (3d ed. 1923) (Shipman).  \nAs an alternative to the demurrer, there were \nvarious types of pleas. The plea in traverse denied the \ndeclaration\u2019s factual allegations and triggered a jury \ntrial. \u201cWhere an allegation is traversed, or denied, it is \nevident that a question is at once raised between the \nparties; and it is a question of fact . . . .\u201d Shipman \n\u00a7 167, at 302; see also Richard Ross Perry, Common-\nLaw Pleading: Its History and Principles 179\u201380 \n(1897) (Perry). \u201c[T]he tender and acceptance of an \nissue of fact close[d] all pleading in the action, as there \n[was] then nothing left but a trial, which [disposed] of \nthe action on its merits.\u201d Shipman \u00a7 15, at 32\u201333.  \nThe common law permitted various other types of \npleas\u2014such as a plea in abatement or plea in bar\u2014\nthat might raise legal or factual issues collateral to \nthe merits. But critically, if any such plea actually \ncontradicted the factual allegations of the plaintiff\u2019s \ndeclaration, the common law would have regarded it \nas a traverse and proceeded immediately to a trial by \njury. \u201cThe word traverse . . . is synonymous with the \nword denial. Where the defendant intends to rely for \nhis defense upon the fact that the allegations \ncontained in the declaration as to the subject matter of \nthe action are untrue, he must put in the plea known \nas a traverse.\u201d McKelvey \u00a7 185, at 118; see also Perry, \nat 275. Therefore in a case (like this one) where the \nfacts relevant to a threshold defect were intertwined \nwith the merits, it would not even have been possible \nto frame the issue for a purely judicial decision at \ncommon law. \nThe petition argues that a bench trial before a \nmagistrate judge gave Mr. Richards many of the other \nimportant protections of a trial, such as a right to \n\n10 \n \n \npresent \nevidence \nand \ncross \nexamine \nopposing \nwitnesses. Pet. 20-21. No doubt those rights are \nimportant. But the right to trial by jury in civil cases \nis separately and specially protected by the Seventh \nAmendment. This Court recently recognized that \n\u201cthe right to trial by jury is \u2018of such importance and \noccupies so firm a place in our history and \njurisprudence that any seeming curtailment of the \nright has always been and \u2018should be scrutinized \nwith the utmost case.\u2019\u201d SEC v. Jarkesy, Slip Op. at 7 \n(2024) (quoting Dimick v. Schiedt, 293 U.S. 474, 486 \n(1935)). And that is by no means a newfound \nsentiment: Justice Story once explained that the civil \njury trial right is \u201cjustly dear to the American \npeople. It has always been an object of deep interest \nand solicitude, and every encroachment upon it has \nbeen watched with great jealousy.\u201d Parsons v. \nBedford, Breedlove & Robeson, 28 U.S. 433, 466 \n(1830). The Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision is entirely \nconsistent with that tradition. \n \n \nB. \nThe Seventh Circuit\u2019s Decision In \n \nPavey Makes No Sense  \nThe Seventh and Ninth Circuit decisions, by \ncontrast, do not genuinely grapple with the Seventh \nAmendment problem and clearly get the answer \nwrong.  \nJudge Posner\u2019s opinion in Pavey takes for \ngranted that questions of subject matter jurisdiction \n\u201coften . . . turn[] on factual issues that may be \ngenuinely debatable, but even if so the issues are \nresolved by the judge,\u201d without recognizing that an \nopposite rule applies when jurisdictional facts are \nintertwined with the merits. Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741. \nThe Pavey opinion then leaps from the observation \n\n11 \n \n \nthat judges sometimes are permitted to decide \nquestions of fact relevant to preliminary threshold \nissues to an entirely unwarranted \u201cgeneralization\u201d \nthat juries do not decide any questions that can be \ncharacterized as matters of \u201cjudicial traffic control.\u201d \nId.  \nIn reaching that conclusion, Pavey wrongly \ncharacterizes exhaustion as just an issue of \u201cjudicial \ntraffic control\u201d on the naked assertion that \u201cin many \ncases\u201d exhaustion is simply a question of the choice \nof forum because \u201cthe only consequence of a failure \nto exhaust is that the prisoner must go back to the \nbottom rung of the administrative ladder.\u201d Id. \u201cThat \ndistinguishes the issue of exhaustion from deadline \nissues that juries decide,\u201d the Seventh Circuit \nreasoned, because \u201c[a] statute of limitations defense \nif successfully interposed ends the litigation rather \nthan shunting it to another forum.\u201d The Seventh \nCircuit acknowledged, however, that in that actual \ncase the defendant \u201cwould no longer have any \nadministrative remedies\u201d if the exhaustion issue was \nresolved against him, so the issue was entirely \ndispositive of the merits. Id. Surely this Court \nunderstands that that will almost always be true in \nPLRA cases. Prisons have grievance and appeal \nprocesses with extremely tight filing windows\u2014\nmeasured in days. By the time an exhaustion issue \nis raised in federal court, those deadlines will \ngenerally be years in the past and will make it \nimpossible for the plaintiff to go back and seek \nfurther exhaustion. See Alison M. Mikkor, Correcting \nfor Bias and Blind Spots in PLRA Exhaustion Law, \n21 George Mason L. Rev. 573, 584 (2014) (\u201cIn the \nlast few years, many corrections departments have \nalso reduced the amount of time within which a \n\n12 \n \n \nprisoner must file her initial grievance and any \nsubsequent appeals.  In the light of the deference \nshown to [these internal] rules in the PLRA \nexhaustion analysis, this reduction means that for \nprisoners in some systems there is effectively only a \ntwo- or three-day statute of limitations on their \nconstitutional claims.\u201d) (footnotes omitted).   \nFinally, the Seventh Circuit reasoned that, \u201c[b]y \nanalogy to the cases that require that claims at law \nbe decided before equitable claims when both types \nof claim are presented,\u201d a jury later hearing the case \non the merits would not be bound by any exhaustion \nfindings the judge made. Id. at 742. But as the Sixth \nCircuit correctly explained, that line of reasoning \n\u201crings hollow\u201d because \u201cif the prisoner\u2019s case is \ndismissed for failure to exhaust his or her \nadministrative remedies\u201d then \u201ca jury would never \nbe assembled to resolve the factual disputes\u201d on the \nmerits. Pet. App. 15a. \nIn Albino v. Baca, the en banc Ninth Circuit \nappeared to embrace Pavey, with the court noting \nthat \u201c[w]e agree with the Seventh Circuit that, if a \nfactual finding on a disputed question is relevant \nboth to exhaustion and to the merits, a judge\u2019s \nfinding made in the course of deciding exhaustion is \nnot binding on a jury deciding the merits of the suit.\u201d \n747 F.3d at 1171. But the claims at issue in Albino \ndid not actually implicate the underlying merits, and \nelsewhere in its opinion the Ninth Circuit used less \ndefinitive language:  \u201cExhaustion should be decided, \nif feasible, before reaching the merits of a prisoner's \nclaim.\u201d  Id. (emphasis added); see also id. (\u201cWe \nreiterate that, if feasible, disputed factual questions \nrelevant to exhaustion should be decided at the very \nbeginning of the litigation.\u201d). Now that the Sixth \n\n13 \n \n \nCircuit has explained the flaws in the Seventh \nCircuit\u2019s reasoning it seems unlikely that other \ncircuits will follow along. Indeed, there is reason to \nhope that the Seventh and Ninth Circuits will \nreconsider their position en banc without a need for \nthis Court\u2019s intervention.  \nThis \nCourt \nalso \nmay \nbenefit \nfrom \nmore \npercolation. Among the courts of appeals, only the \nSixth and Seventh Circuits have addressed the issue \npresented head-on. Several district courts in the \nSecond Circuit have parted ways with Pavey. Other \ncircuits have identified the problem as well and will \nalmost certainly in due course wrestle with it more \nfully. See Small v. Camden County, 728 F.3d 265, \n270 (3d Cir. 2013) (\u201c[T]he Seventh Amendment is not \nimplicated as long as the facts are not bound up with \nthe merits of the underlying dispute.\u201d); Messa v. \nGoord, 652 F.3d 305, 309 (2d Cir. 2011) (\u201c[T]he \nfactual disputes relating to exhaustion are not \nintertwined with the merits . . . .\u201d); Dillon v. Rogers, \n596 F.3d 260, 272 n.2 (5th Cir. 2010) (\u201cWe do not \ndetermine today who should serve as factfinder \nwhen facts concerning exhaustion also go to the \nmerits of a prisoner\u2019s claim.\u201d). And, given the \nfavorable decision in the Sixth Circuit, prisoners will \nbe more likely to raise the issue going forward. \n \nC. \nExhaustion \nFacts \nShould \nBe \nDecided By Juries Even When They \nAre Not Intertwined With The \nMerits \n \nThe Sixth Circuit decided this case against the \nbackdrop of its own precedent holding that facts \nrelated to exhaustion can be resolved by judges when \n\n14 \n \n \nthey are not intertwined with the merits. That \nassumption is widely shared by the lower courts. \nAlthough it is not necessary to reach the issue in this \ncase, the Court should understand that that \nassumption is probably wrong. The reason goes back \nto the issue the Seventh Circuit failed to wrestle \nwith in Pavey: that a finding of non-exhaustion in \nthe PLRA context will almost always bar the claim \nforever. \nRecall that at common law a defendant who \ncould not or chose not to demur could either file a \ntraverse or a plea. There were a variety of pleas, but \nthe most common were \u201cpleas in abatement\u201d and \n\u201cpleas in bar.\u201d The plea in abatement was one of the \n\u201cdilatory pleas,\u201d which raised a class of common law \ndefenses that merely \u201cdelay[ed] the plaintiff\u2019s action \ninstead of dealing with the merits of his claim.\u201d \nGeorge L. Clark, Common Law Pleading \u00a7 59, at 131 \n(1931) (Clark); McKelvey \u00a7 132, at 93 (\u201cJudgment \nupon the dilatory plea was not final, . . . it did not \ndetermine the case upon the merits.\u201d).3 A plea in \nabatement, if successful, \u201cdispose[d] of the particular \nsuit\u201d but allowed the plaintiff to \u201ccommence anew \nupon the same cause of action in the same court\u201d so \nlong as the plaintiff avoided the mistake that caused \nthe original abating. McKelvey \u00a7 131, at 92. Typically, \na plea in abatement related to the parties\u2019 identities, a \nmisnomer in the declaration of facts, or a defect in the \n                                                 \n3 The other dilatory pleas were pleas to the jurisdiction and pleas \nin suspension of the action. Clark \u00a7 59, at 132. Pleas to the \njurisdiction attacked a court\u2019s subject matter or personal \njurisdiction, disposing of the case entirely before that court if \nsuccessful. McKelvey \u00a7\u00a7 131, 134, at 92, 95. Pleas in suspension of \nthe action sought to identify the plaintiff\u2019s temporary incapacity \nto bring suit. Id. \u00a7 131, at 92; Clark \u00a7 60, at 134; Shipman \u00a7 230, \nat 400. \n\n15 \n \n \nplaintiff\u2019s writ. Id. \u00a7\u00a7 134\u2013135, at 95; Moskovitz, at \n1885. Defects in the plaintiff\u2019s writ included \u201cwrong \nvenue,\u201d that the \u201caction was brought prematurely,\u201d \nthat \u201cthe same claim was pending in another court,\u201d \nthat \u201cthe parties were misnamed,\u201d or that \u201ca \nnecessary party was not joined or . . . was misjoined.\u201d \nMoskovitz, at 1885.  \nMany lower courts have broadly analogized \nexhaustion of administrative remedies to the old \nplea in abatement, and held that there is no Seventh \nAmendment right to jury factfinding because \nsupposedly factual disputes relevant to a plea in \nabatement were resolved by judges. See, e.g., Bryant \nv. Rich, 530 F.3d 1368, 1374 (11th Cir. 2008) \n(\u201cExhaustion of administrative remedies is a matter \nin abatement, and ordinarily does not deal with the \nmerits.\u201d (cleaned up) (quoting 5C Wright & Miller \n\u00a7 1360, at 78 n.15)); Albino, 747 F.3d at 1168. That \nassumption is actually disputed by scholars.4 \nRegardless, the analogy is wrong. The dilatory pleas \n(including abatement) \u201cdid not determine the case \nupon the merits.\u201d McKelvey \u00a7 132, at 93. A plea in \nabatement merely \u201cdelay[ed] the plaintiff\u2019s action \ninstead of dealing with the merits of his claim.\u201d Clark \n\u00a7 59, at 131. By definition, therefore, a plea in \nabatement could not present an argument that the \n                                                 \n4 Pleas in abatement typically tendered an issue of law properly \n\u201celiminated on demurrer\u201d by the judge. A.C. Umbreit, Outline \nof the Law of Common Law Pleading, 4 Marq. L. Rev. 130, 133 \n(1920). But if the plaintiff did not demur, \u201c[t]here is extensive \nhistorical support that a factual dispute on a matter in \nabatement \n[could \nalso \nbe] \ndecided \nby \nthe \njury . . . as \ndocumented in civil cases, in criminal cases, and in numerous \ntreatises.\u201d Moskovitz, at 1896 & nn.234\u201336 (collecting sources \nsupporting jury resolution of fact disputes posed by various \ndilatory pleas). \n\n16 \n \n \nplaintiff\u2019s claim was permanently barred. Matters in \nabatement \u201ccould only go so far as to defeat the \npresent action, and not to demonstrate that the \nplaintiff was permanently disabled from bringing the \nclaim.\u201d Moskovitz, at 1886. Any plea in abatement \nbased on a prematurity defect necessarily alleged that \nthe action was curably premature. See, e.g., Shipman \n\u00a7 225, at 390 n.18 (citing Grand Lodge Bhd. of R.R. \nTrainmen v. Randolph, 57 N.E. 882 (1900), as an \nexample of a plea in abatement alleging \u201cfailure to \nexhaust remedies provided in [a] contract\u201d). Again, \nhowever, in most PLRA cases the very short prison \ngrievance timelines will have expired long before suit \nso a finding of non-exhaustion will permanently bar \nthe claim. \nIn common law terms, an affirmative defense that \nwould permanently end the litigation would have been \nraised by a \u201cplea in bar,\u201d and specifically a variant \ncalled a plea \u201cin discharge.\u201d Pleas in bar could be pled \nnegatively, as a traverse denying the factual \nallegations, or affirmatively, as a confession and \navoidance admitting the facts but denying their legal \neffect by alleging new facts. Shipman \u00a7 197\u2013199, at \n348. Pleas in confession and avoidance were divided \ninto two categories: pleas in justification or excuse and \npleas in discharge. Id. Pleas in discharge included \nbankruptcy, release, payment, and the statute of \nlimitations\u2014all of which alleged that the plaintiff\u2019s \ncause of action had \u201cbeen discharged by some matter \nsubsequent, either of fact or of law.\u201d Id \u00a7 198(b), at \n348; id. \u00a7 199, at 350; cf. Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c)(1). \nLike a statute of limitations issue, an exhaustion \ndefect arises after a \u00a7 1983 claim accrues and \ntherefore is more analogous to a matter in discharge \nthan in abatement. And a judge would never have \n\n17 \n \n \ndecided disputed facts posed by a plea in discharge. If \nthe plea contained a traverse disputing the plaintiff\u2019s \nfacts, the issue was joined and a jury trial was \ntriggered. If the plea was instead framed as a \nconfession and avoidance, then the ball was in the \nplaintiff\u2019s court. See Perry, at 179\u201380, 272\u201373. The \nplaintiff could respond with his own demurrer, \naccepting the new facts alleged in avoidance but \ndenying their legal effect, which would frame up an \nissue of law for the judge. Id. Or the plaintiff could \nrespond with a traverse to the plea, joining issue on \nthe merits and triggering a trial. See id. There were \nsome other ways to procure judicial decision of a true \nquestion of law, such as the arcane concept of \u201cexpress \ncolor\u201d in trespass actions.5 As far as counsel can \ndetermine, however, a defendant could never procure \njudicial resolution of disputed facts relevant to a \ndispositive affirmative defense like exhaustion. \n \nII.  \nTHE \nPETITION \nOVERSTATES \nTHE \nSUPPOSED \nCONFLICT \nWITH \nTHE \nPLRA\u2019S PURPOSES, WHICH DO NOT \nTRUMP THE SEVENTH AMENDMENT \nIN ANY EVENT \n \nThe Seventh Circuit justified its distortion of \ntraditional jury trial principles because it thought \n\u201c[t]he alternative . . . is unsatisfactory\u201d and \u201cwould \nthwart Congress\u2019s effort to bar trials of prisoner \n                                                 \n5 See Shipman \u00a7\u00a7 200\u2013202, at 350\u201355; Perry, at 274\u201376. Even \nthen, if the issue of law was not \u201cwholly foreign to the merits of \nthe cause,\u201d Shipman \u00a7 202, at 354\u201355, and could not be \n\u201csegregate[d] . . . from the remaining matters of fact,\u201d Perry, at \n275, then the defendant could not withdraw the matter from the \njury.  \n\n18 \n \n \ncases in which the prisoner has failed to exhaust his \nadministrative remedies.\u201d Pavey, 544 F.3d at 742. \nThe petition doubles down on that position, devoting \nbarrels of ink to arguing that Congress intended to \nmake exhaustion a \u201cthreshold issue[] of judicial \nadministration,\u201d Pet. 17 (quoting Lee v. Willey, 789 \nF.3d 673, 678 (6th Cir. 2015)), to weed out frivolous \nclaims. The petition notably ignores the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s conclusion that Richards\u2019s allegations were \n\u201cserious and detailed\u201d and could not \u201creasonably be \nconsidered frivolous.\u201d Pet. App. 8a. Instead, the \npetition elects to criticizes the Sixth Circuit for \n\u201cfail[ing] \nto \ngive \ndeference\u201d \nin \nits \nSeventh \nAmendment \nanalysis \nto \nCongress\u2019s \nsupposed \nobjectives, Pet. 20. \nAll of this is both irrelevant and overstated. It is \nirrelevant because Congress\u2019s desire to reduce the \nworkload of the federal courts does not give it a free \npass to violate the Bill of Rights. If the Seventh \nAmendment protects a right to jury resolution of all \nfacts intertwined with the merits of a legal claim \n(and it does) then the Seventh Amendment controls. \nCongress has ample tools to address this perceived \nproblem without violating the jury trial right, and it \nhas used them\u2014aggressively.  \nThese concerns are overstated for a couple of \nreasons. First, in Woodford and Jones this Court has \nalready rejected the once-pervasive arguments and \nholdings that PLRA exhaustion is a jurisdictional or \nquasi-jurisdictional right not to face litigation at all, \nwhich necessarily must be resolved before anything \nelse happens in a case. Prior to Woodford and Jones, \nthe lower courts invented procedural vehicles found \nnowhere \nin \nthe \nFederal \nRules, \nsuch \nas \nthe \n\u201cunenumerated 12(b) motion,\u201d Wyatt v. Terhune, 315 \n\n19 \n \n \nF.3d 1108 (9th Cir. 2003); requiring prisoner plaintiffs \nto plead exhaustion with specificity up front; or \ndismissing entire complaints if any claim was not \nexhausted. See Jones, 549 U.S. at 203 (holding that \nthese innovations \u201cexceed[ed] the proper limits on the \njudicial role\u201d). But this Court held that exhaustion is \nan ordinary affirmative defense. See id. at 212-214. \nAffirmative defenses (all of them) must be raised by \nanswer under Rule 8(c), which places the burden of \nproof on the defendant and leaves the question to be \nresolved in the ordinary course through summary \njudgment or trial. No doubt the lower courts find those \nholdings inconvenient (or \u201cunsatisfactory,\u201d Pavey, 544 \nF.3d at 742), but they represent this Court\u2019s \nconclusion that in fact Congress did not intend to \nmake exhaustion of administrative remedies some \nkind of threshold super-requirement. When it wants \nto, Congress knows how to write jurisdictional \nstatutes, or immunity statutes like the Foreign \nSovereign Immunities Act, which create a vehicle for \nthreshold resolution of some important issue before \nanything else happens. It did not take that course in \nthe PLRA, and this Court has already said so. See id. \nat 216 (noting the conspicuous \u201cfailure of Congress to \ninclude exhaustion in terms among the enumerated \ngrounds justifying dismissal upon early screening\u201d). \nSecond, the Sixth Circuit\u2019s holding is narrow and \nthere is no reason to think it will have a dramatic \nimpact on prisoner litigation. The Sixth Circuit \n\u201cemphasize[d] that a jury trial is appropriate in \nthese circumstances only if the district court finds \nthat genuine disputes of material fact concerning \nPLRA exhaustion are decisive of the merits of the \nplaintiff\u2019s claim.\u201d Pet. App. 19a. (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). The petition argues that every \n\n20 \n \n \nprisoner suit will somehow allege exhaustion facts \nintertwined with the merits, but the ordinary rules \nof civil procedure are up to that challenge\u2014and if \nnot this Court has, \u201c[i]n a series of recent cases, . . . \nexplained that courts should generally not depart \nfrom the usual practice under the Federal Rules on \nthe basis of perceived policy concerns.\u201d See id. at \n212. The Sixth Circuit\u2019s rule has already been \napplied in district courts throughout the Second \nCircuit for more than a decade without issue. See \nPet. App. 15a-16a.  \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nThe petition should be denied.  \n \n \n \n \n \nJ.

This Court has held that judges can \ndecide facts related to threshold issues\u2014\nlike exhaustion\u2014without violating the \nSeventh Amendment. .................................. 16 \nB. The Seventh Amendment does not \npreserve the right to a jury trial on any \nfactual questions concerning exhaustion \nbecause exhaustion derives from equity. .... 19 \n\niii \n \n1. The Seventh Amendment guarantees \na jury trial right only as to issues \ntried by a jury in suits at common \nlaw at the time the Seventh \nAmendment was adopted. ..................... 20 \n2. Exhaustion did not exist at the \ncommon law, but closely analogous \nequitable issues were not decided by \njuries in 1791. ........................................ 22 \na. No historical antecedent to \nexhaustion existed at common \nlaw, but its origins are equitable \nin nature. ......................................... 23 \nb. Traditional equitable defenses \nsuch as adequate remedy at law, \nforum non conveniens, \nabstention, and habeas corpus \nbars are an appropriate common-\nlaw analog for exhaustion. .............. 27 \n3. Juries did not historically determine \nquestions of fact related to equitable \ndefenses analogous to exhaustion. ........ 33 \n4. Functional considerations \ndemonstrate that judges, not juries, \nshould determine exhaustion \nquestions. ............................................... 35 \nII. The Seventh Amendment does not preserve \nthe right to a jury trial on factual questions \nconcerning exhaustion even when those \nfactual questions are intertwined with the \nunderlying merits. .............................................. 37 \n\niv \n \nA. Beacon Theatres created a presumption \nthat juries should decide intertwined \nlegal and equitable issues, but that \npresumption does not apply here. ............... 38 \n1. The presumption does not apply \nbecause exhaustion is a threshold \nissue that is logically precedent to the \nmerits. .................................................... 41 \n2. The presumption does not apply \nbecause a judge\u2019s factual findings \nregarding exhaustion would not \npreclude a jury\u2019s consideration of the \nsame facts when determining the \nmerits of the legal claim. ....................... 43 \nB.

The \nopinion of the United States District Court for the \nWestern District of Michigan (Pet. App. 22a\u201328a) is \nnot reported but is available at 2022 WL 842654. \nJURISDICTION \nThe district court had jurisdiction over claims \nbrought by Respondent Kyle Brandon Richards under \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. The district \ncourt entered judgment for Petitioner Thomas Perttu \non March 22, 2022. Richards filed a timely notice of \nappeal by right on April 11, 2022. The court of appeals \nhad jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s final \njudgment under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. This Court has ju-\nrisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \n \n \n\n2 \n \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe Seventh Amendment to the United States \nConstitution, U.S. Const. amend. VII, provides: \nIn suits at common law, where the value in \ncontroversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the \nright of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no \nfact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-ex-\namined in any Court of the United States, \nthan according to the rules of the common law. \nThe Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a), states in applicable part: \n(a) No action shall be brought with respect to \nprison conditions under section 1983 of this ti-\ntle, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner \nconfined in any jail, prison, or other correc-\ntional facility until such administrative reme-\ndies as are available are exhausted. \nINTRODUCTION \nThe importance of the Seventh Amendment right \nto a trial by jury is well recognized. Less clear, but \nequally important, is the central principle that under-\ngirds the right: preservation of the right to a jury\u2019s ul-\ntimate determination of issues of fact where a case \nproceeds to trial. Embedded in that principle is a tacit \nlimitation\u2014the Seventh Amendment does not guar-\nantee the right to a jury trial on every fact question \nwithin a jury-triable case. Rather, the right is impli-\ncated only when a particular issue or trial decision \nmust fall to the jury to maintain the substance of the \n\n3 \n \ncommon-law right as it existed in 1791. This limita-\ntion is consistent with this Court\u2019s jurisprudence\u2014\nboth its historical view of the Seventh Amendment \nand its treatment of cases involving an overlap of legal \nand equitable issues that implicate collateral estoppel \nconcerns as opposed to cases where those concerns are \nnot present.  \nThe issue of exhaustion under the PLRA is not one \nfor a jury. Exhaustion has no precise historical analog, \nand the closest analogs are forum-based equitable de-\nfenses, which were historically decided by judges, not \nby juries.  \nThis understanding endures even where the facts \nunderlying the question of exhaustion are intertwined \nwith the merits of a prisoner\u2019s claim. In this circum-\nstance, a judge\u2019s determination as to exhaustion does \nnot impinge on the \u201csubstance\u201d of the jury trial right\u2014\nthat right remains preserved. Where the prisoner has \nproperly exhausted administrative remedies, a jury \nmay then be impaneled to find the facts concerning \nthe underlying claims and will not be bound by the \njudge\u2019s earlier factual determinations. This division of \nduties is consistent with a judge\u2019s gatekeeping role, \ncomports with the goals of the PLRA, and protects the \nright to trial by jury. \n \n \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. The PLRA Framework \nIn 1970, just over 2,000 prisoner civil rights suits \nwere filed in federal courts. Margo Schlanger, Trends \nin Prisoner Litigation, as the PLRA Approaches 20, 28 \nCorr. L. Reporter, 69, 71 (2017). Shortly after that, fil-\nings exploded. Id.  \nIn 1980, Congress took a first stab at an exhaus-\ntion provision for prisoner suits filed under \u00a7 1983. \nUnder the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons \nAct, 94 Stat. 352, as amended, district courts could \nstay a prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 1983 suit for up to 180 days while \nthe prisoner pursued \u201cplain, speedy, and effective ad-\nministrative remedies.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a)(1) (for-\nmer). The exhaustion requirement was discretionary \nthough\u2014exhaustion could be required only if the \nstate\u2019s prison grievance system met federal standards \nand if exhaustion was \u201cappropriate and in the inter-\nests of justice.\u201d \u00a7 1997e(a)(1), (2). \nBut that exhaustion provision did not stem the \ntide of prisoner litigation. By the mid-1990s, correc-\ntional systems and federal courts were overburdened \nby a mammoth caseload of prisoner litigation. In 1995 \nalone, 39,053 prisoner lawsuits were filed in federal \ncourt, a rate of 24.6 per 1,000 prisoners. Schlanger, \nTrends in Prisoner Litigation, supra, at 71. Not sur-\nprisingly, this strained the resources of the federal \ncourt system, not to mention correctional systems.  \nIn 1996, Congress enacted the PLRA \u201cin the wake \nof a sharp rise in prisoner litigation in the federal \ncourts.\u201d Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 84 (2006) \n\n5 \n \n(citing Alexander v. Hawk, 159 F.3d 1321, 1324\u201325 \n(11th Cir. 1998) (citing statistics)). A significant com-\nponent of the PLRA was a robust, mandatory exhaus-\ntion requirement. Congress \u201cinvigorated the exhaus-\ntion prescription\u201d that had existed under the prior re-\ngime, now requiring prisoners to fully exhaust all of \ntheir available administrative remedies through the \ngrievance process as a prerequisite to filing suit in fed-\neral court. Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 524 (2002).  \nAs stated by this Court, \u201cBeyond doubt, Congress \nenacted \u00a7 1997e(a) to reduce the quantity and improve \nthe quality of prisoner suits.\u201d Id. at 524. To further \nthis end, \u201cCongress afforded corrections officials time \nand opportunity to address complaints internally\u201d \nprior to prisoners seeking relief in federal court. Id. at \n525. By giving correctional officials the opportunity to \naddress grievances, \u201ccorrective action taken in re-\nsponse to an inmate\u2019s grievance might improve prison \nadministration and satisfy the inmate, thereby obvi-\nating the need for litigation.\u201d Id. (citing Booth v. \nChurner, 532 U.S. 731, 737 (2001)). In addition, a \nprison\u2019s \u201cinternal review might \u2018filter out some frivo-\nlous claims.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting Booth, 532 U.S. at 737). \nAnd the administrative record created by the prisons\u2019 \ninternal grievance processes would facilitate consider-\nation of those \u201ccases ultimately brought to court.\u201d Id. \n(citations omitted).  \nThe PLRA has been tremendously successful in \nreducing the burden on both prison officials and fed-\neral courts. From the peak of filings in 1995, within \nfive years of the passage of the PLRA prisoner law-\nsuits had fallen by 43%, even though the total prisoner \npopulation grew by 23%. Margo Schlanger, Inmate \n\n6 \n \nLitigation, 116 Harv. L. Rev. 1555, 1694 (2003). This \ndecline continued for several more years. By 2006, the \ndecline reached 60%. Margo Schlanger & Giovanna \nShay, Preserving the Rule of Law in America\u2019s Jails \nand Prisons: The Case for Amending the Prison Liti-\ngation Reform Act, 11 U. Pa. J. Const. L. 139, 141\u201342 \n(2008). Although the decline gradually plateaued, by \n2014, prisoners filed 25,324 lawsuits, a rate of 11.6 per \n1,000 prisoners. Schlanger, Trends in Prisoner Litiga-\ntion, supra, at 71. Compared to 1995, this represents \na 34% decrease in the number of prisoner lawsuits and \na 53% decline in the rate of lawsuits filed per 1,000 \nprisoners. See id. The exhaustion requirement has \nbeen a critical component of the PLRA\u2019s success.  \nB. MDOC\u2019s grievance process \nThe Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC) \nhas two separate processes for grievances. One is the \nstandard grievance procedure, governed by MDOC \nPolicy Directive 03.02.130, which is not applicable \nhere. J.A. 41\u201361. The other is the administrative pro-\ncess under the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA), \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 15601, et seq., and the Prohibited Sexual \nConduct Involving Prisoners policy (effective date \n04/24/2017), governed by MDOC Policy Directive \n03.03.140. J.A. 62\u201387.  \nThe PREA grievance procedure applies to Rich-\nards\u2019 claims of sexual abuse, harassment, and miscon-\nduct. MDOC uses a two-step process for PREA griev-\nances, both of which must be exhausted. J.A. 74\u201375. \nMDOC will not facially reject or deny grievances al-\nleging sexual abuse. J.A. 74\u201375. Instead, such \n\n7 \n \ngrievances must be investigated. J.A. 76. \u201cA prisoner \nmay file a PREA grievance at any time.\u201d J.A. 75.  \nA prisoner initiates the first step of the process by \nfiling a PREA Prisoner Grievance Form (Step I). \nJ.A. 75. Prisoners may grieve retaliation for reporting \nsexual abuse, harassment, or misconduct through the \nPREA grievance process. J.A. 72\u201373. PREA griev-\nances may not be referred to MDOC staff who are the \nsubject of the grievance. J.A. 76.  \nAt Step I, the PREA Coordinator1 must ensure \nthat \u201ca written response is provided to the prisoner \nwithin 60 calendar days of receipt of the Step I PREA \nGrievance,\u201d although an extension of up to 70 calen-\ndar days may be requested. J.A. 76\u201377. Prisoners \nmust be notified in writing of any extensions and the \ndue date for a response. J.A. 76\u201377.  \nPrisoners may appeal a Step I decision to Step II \nif they are unsatisfied with the response or the re-\nsponse was not timely. J.A. 77. MDOC\u2019s response to a \nStep II appeal is due within 90 calendar days of re-\nceipt, absent an extension, and it constitutes the final \ndecision in the matter. J.A. 77.  \nC. District Court Proceedings and Eviden-\ntiary Hearing \nRichards and co-Plaintiffs Kenneth Damon Pruitt \nand Robert Kissee filed suit under \u00a7 1983, alleging \nthat Perttu, a Resident Unit Manager (RUM) for the \nMDOC, sexually harassed them and other prisoners, \n \n1 Every prison has a PREA Coordinator designated by the war-\nden. J.A. 67.  \n\n8 \n \nretaliated against them, and destroyed their property, \nin violation of the First, Fifth, and Eighth Amend-\nments. J.A. 1\u201338. Perttu moved for summary judg-\nment, asserting that Richards and his co-Plaintiffs \nfailed to exhaust administrative remedies before filing \ntheir complaint. Pet. App. 3a. Richards and his co-\nPlaintiffs alleged that Perttu had destroyed their \ngrievances or otherwise prevented them from being \nprocessed, making the grievance process unavailable. \nPet. App. 30a, 37a, 59a\u201360a. \nThe district court denied Perttu\u2019s motion, finding \nthat there was a question of fact as to whether the \ngrievance process was available to Richards due to his \nallegation that Perttu interfered with his grievance \nfilings. Pet. App. 79a\u201381a, 83a.  \nFollowing this ruling, the magistrate judge con-\nducted an evidentiary hearing on the issue of exhaus-\ntion. J.A. 88\u2013368. Evaluating the testimony, evidence, \nand arguments presented, the magistrate judge rec-\nommended that the district court conclude that Perttu \ncarried his burden of establishing \u201cthat Plaintiffs \nfailed to exhaust any of their claims before filing suit,\u201d \nPet. App. 64a, 76a, and that the \u201cadministrative rem-\nedies were generally available\u201d to Richards and his co-\nPlaintiffs. Pet. App. 68a.  \nIn reaching that conclusion, the magistrate judge \nfound that Richards\u2019 direct examinations, which re-\nlied on leading questions, undermined the credibility \nof his witnesses. Pet. App. 69a. The magistrate judge \nthen discussed how the circumstances surrounding \nthe alleged observations of Perttu destroying griev-\nances similarly undermined Plaintiffs\u2019 credibility. Pet. \nApp. 71a\u201373a. Notably, the evidence \u201cdemonstrate[d] \n\n9 \n \nthat RUM Perttu could not, and in fact did not, inter-\ncept and destroy all grievances filed by Plaintiffs in \nthe relevant time\u201d: \n[E]ven on the dates that RUM Perttu worked, \nhe testified that he only works from 7:00am to \n3:30pm. Moreover, RUM Perttu did not work \nseven days a week every week from June 2019 \nto March 2020. Indeed, on at least one of the \ndates on which Richards alleges Perttu de-\nstroyed his grievances, January 1, 2020, \nPerttu testified that he was not working due \nto the New Years holiday. \nPet. App. 73a\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

This Court has held that judges can \ndecide facts related to threshold issues\u2014\nlike exhaustion\u2014without violating the \nSeventh Amendment. .................................. 16 \nB. The Seventh Amendment does not \npreserve the right to a jury trial on any \nfactual questions concerning exhaustion \nbecause exhaustion derives from equity. .... 19 \n\niii \n \n1. The Seventh Amendment guarantees \na jury trial right only as to issues \ntried by a jury in suits at common \nlaw at the time the Seventh \nAmendment was adopted. ..................... 20 \n2. Exhaustion did not exist at the \ncommon law, but closely analogous \nequitable issues were not decided by \njuries in 1791. ........................................ 22 \na. No historical antecedent to \nexhaustion existed at common \nlaw, but its origins are equitable \nin nature. ......................................... 23 \nb. Traditional equitable defenses \nsuch as adequate remedy at law, \nforum non conveniens, \nabstention, and habeas corpus \nbars are an appropriate common-\nlaw analog for exhaustion. .............. 27 \n3. Juries did not historically determine \nquestions of fact related to equitable \ndefenses analogous to exhaustion. ........ 33 \n4. Functional considerations \ndemonstrate that judges, not juries, \nshould determine exhaustion \nquestions. ............................................... 35 \nII. The Seventh Amendment does not preserve \nthe right to a jury trial on factual questions \nconcerning exhaustion even when those \nfactual questions are intertwined with the \nunderlying merits. .............................................. 37 \n\niv \n \nA. Beacon Theatres created a presumption \nthat juries should decide intertwined \nlegal and equitable issues, but that \npresumption does not apply here. ............... 38 \n1. The presumption does not apply \nbecause exhaustion is a threshold \nissue that is logically precedent to the \nmerits. .................................................... 41 \n2. The presumption does not apply \nbecause a judge\u2019s factual findings \nregarding exhaustion would not \npreclude a jury\u2019s consideration of the \nsame facts when determining the \nmerits of the legal claim. ....................... 43 \nB. Unlike in Beacon Theatres, a judicial \ndetermination of exhaustion would \nimplement congressional intent. ................. 46 \nConclusion ................................................................. 48 \n \n\nv \n \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES \nPage \nCases \nAlbino v.

App. 22a\u201328a) is \nnot reported but is available at 2022 WL 842654. \nJURISDICTION \nThe district court had jurisdiction over claims \nbrought by Respondent Kyle Brandon Richards under \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. The district \ncourt entered judgment for Petitioner Thomas Perttu \non March 22, 2022. Richards filed a timely notice of \nappeal by right on April 11, 2022. The court of appeals \nhad jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s final \njudgment under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. This Court has ju-\nrisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \n \n \n\n2 \n \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe Seventh Amendment to the United States \nConstitution, U.S. Const. amend. VII, provides: \nIn suits at common law, where the value in \ncontroversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the \nright of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no \nfact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-ex-\namined in any Court of the United States, \nthan according to the rules of the common law. \nThe Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a), states in applicable part: \n(a) No action shall be brought with respect to \nprison conditions under section 1983 of this ti-\ntle, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner \nconfined in any jail, prison, or other correc-\ntional facility until such administrative reme-\ndies as are available are exhausted. \nINTRODUCTION \nThe importance of the Seventh Amendment right \nto a trial by jury is well recognized. Less clear, but \nequally important, is the central principle that under-\ngirds the right: preservation of the right to a jury\u2019s ul-\ntimate determination of issues of fact where a case \nproceeds to trial. Embedded in that principle is a tacit \nlimitation\u2014the Seventh Amendment does not guar-\nantee the right to a jury trial on every fact question \nwithin a jury-triable case. Rather, the right is impli-\ncated only when a particular issue or trial decision \nmust fall to the jury to maintain the substance of the \n\n3 \n \ncommon-law right as it existed in 1791. This limita-\ntion is consistent with this Court\u2019s jurisprudence\u2014\nboth its historical view of the Seventh Amendment \nand its treatment of cases involving an overlap of legal \nand equitable issues that implicate collateral estoppel \nconcerns as opposed to cases where those concerns are \nnot present.  \nThe issue of exhaustion under the PLRA is not one \nfor a jury. Exhaustion has no precise historical analog, \nand the closest analogs are forum-based equitable de-\nfenses, which were historically decided by judges, not \nby juries.  \nThis understanding endures even where the facts \nunderlying the question of exhaustion are intertwined \nwith the merits of a prisoner\u2019s claim. In this circum-\nstance, a judge\u2019s determination as to exhaustion does \nnot impinge on the \u201csubstance\u201d of the jury trial right\u2014\nthat right remains preserved. Where the prisoner has \nproperly exhausted administrative remedies, a jury \nmay then be impaneled to find the facts concerning \nthe underlying claims and will not be bound by the \njudge\u2019s earlier factual determinations. This division of \nduties is consistent with a judge\u2019s gatekeeping role, \ncomports with the goals of the PLRA, and protects the \nright to trial by jury. \n \n \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. The PLRA Framework \nIn 1970, just over 2,000 prisoner civil rights suits \nwere filed in federal courts. Margo Schlanger, Trends \nin Prisoner Litigation, as the PLRA Approaches 20, 28 \nCorr. L. Reporter, 69, 71 (2017). Shortly after that, fil-\nings exploded. Id.  \nIn 1980, Congress took a first stab at an exhaus-\ntion provision for prisoner suits filed under \u00a7 1983. \nUnder the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons \nAct, 94 Stat. 352, as amended, district courts could \nstay a prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 1983 suit for up to 180 days while \nthe prisoner pursued \u201cplain, speedy, and effective ad-\nministrative remedies.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a)(1) (for-\nmer). The exhaustion requirement was discretionary \nthough\u2014exhaustion could be required only if the \nstate\u2019s prison grievance system met federal standards \nand if exhaustion was \u201cappropriate and in the inter-\nests of justice.\u201d \u00a7 1997e(a)(1), (2). \nBut that exhaustion provision did not stem the \ntide of prisoner litigation. By the mid-1990s, correc-\ntional systems and federal courts were overburdened \nby a mammoth caseload of prisoner litigation. In 1995 \nalone, 39,053 prisoner lawsuits were filed in federal \ncourt, a rate of 24.6 per 1,000 prisoners. Schlanger, \nTrends in Prisoner Litigation, supra, at 71. Not sur-\nprisingly, this strained the resources of the federal \ncourt system, not to mention correctional systems.  \nIn 1996, Congress enacted the PLRA \u201cin the wake \nof a sharp rise in prisoner litigation in the federal \ncourts.\u201d Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 84 (2006) \n\n5 \n \n(citing Alexander v. Hawk, 159 F.3d 1321, 1324\u201325 \n(11th Cir. 1998) (citing statistics)). A significant com-\nponent of the PLRA was a robust, mandatory exhaus-\ntion requirement. Congress \u201cinvigorated the exhaus-\ntion prescription\u201d that had existed under the prior re-\ngime, now requiring prisoners to fully exhaust all of \ntheir available administrative remedies through the \ngrievance process as a prerequisite to filing suit in fed-\neral court. Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 524 (2002).  \nAs stated by this Court, \u201cBeyond doubt, Congress \nenacted \u00a7 1997e(a) to reduce the quantity and improve \nthe quality of prisoner suits.\u201d Id. at 524. To further \nthis end, \u201cCongress afforded corrections officials time \nand opportunity to address complaints internally\u201d \nprior to prisoners seeking relief in federal court. Id. at \n525. By giving correctional officials the opportunity to \naddress grievances, \u201ccorrective action taken in re-\nsponse to an inmate\u2019s grievance might improve prison \nadministration and satisfy the inmate, thereby obvi-\nating the need for litigation.\u201d Id. (citing Booth v. \nChurner, 532 U.S. 731, 737 (2001)). In addition, a \nprison\u2019s \u201cinternal review might \u2018filter out some frivo-\nlous claims.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting Booth, 532 U.S. at 737). \nAnd the administrative record created by the prisons\u2019 \ninternal grievance processes would facilitate consider-\nation of those \u201ccases ultimately brought to court.\u201d Id. \n(citations omitted).  \nThe PLRA has been tremendously successful in \nreducing the burden on both prison officials and fed-\neral courts. From the peak of filings in 1995, within \nfive years of the passage of the PLRA prisoner law-\nsuits had fallen by 43%, even though the total prisoner \npopulation grew by 23%. Margo Schlanger, Inmate \n\n6 \n \nLitigation, 116 Harv. L. Rev. 1555, 1694 (2003). This \ndecline continued for several more years. By 2006, the \ndecline reached 60%. Margo Schlanger & Giovanna \nShay, Preserving the Rule of Law in America\u2019s Jails \nand Prisons: The Case for Amending the Prison Liti-\ngation Reform Act, 11 U. Pa. J. Const. L. 139, 141\u201342 \n(2008). Although the decline gradually plateaued, by \n2014, prisoners filed 25,324 lawsuits, a rate of 11.6 per \n1,000 prisoners. Schlanger, Trends in Prisoner Litiga-\ntion, supra, at 71. Compared to 1995, this represents \na 34% decrease in the number of prisoner lawsuits and \na 53% decline in the rate of lawsuits filed per 1,000 \nprisoners. See id. The exhaustion requirement has \nbeen a critical component of the PLRA\u2019s success.  \nB. MDOC\u2019s grievance process \nThe Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC) \nhas two separate processes for grievances. One is the \nstandard grievance procedure, governed by MDOC \nPolicy Directive 03.02.130, which is not applicable \nhere. J.A. 41\u201361. The other is the administrative pro-\ncess under the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA), \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 15601, et seq., and the Prohibited Sexual \nConduct Involving Prisoners policy (effective date \n04/24/2017), governed by MDOC Policy Directive \n03.03.140. J.A. 62\u201387.  \nThe PREA grievance procedure applies to Rich-\nards\u2019 claims of sexual abuse, harassment, and miscon-\nduct. MDOC uses a two-step process for PREA griev-\nances, both of which must be exhausted. J.A. 74\u201375. \nMDOC will not facially reject or deny grievances al-\nleging sexual abuse. J.A. 74\u201375. Instead, such \n\n7 \n \ngrievances must be investigated. J.A. 76. \u201cA prisoner \nmay file a PREA grievance at any time.\u201d J.A. 75.  \nA prisoner initiates the first step of the process by \nfiling a PREA Prisoner Grievance Form (Step I). \nJ.A. 75. Prisoners may grieve retaliation for reporting \nsexual abuse, harassment, or misconduct through the \nPREA grievance process. J.A. 72\u201373. PREA griev-\nances may not be referred to MDOC staff who are the \nsubject of the grievance. J.A. 76.  \nAt Step I, the PREA Coordinator1 must ensure \nthat \u201ca written response is provided to the prisoner \nwithin 60 calendar days of receipt of the Step I PREA \nGrievance,\u201d although an extension of up to 70 calen-\ndar days may be requested. J.A. 76\u201377. Prisoners \nmust be notified in writing of any extensions and the \ndue date for a response. J.A. 76\u201377.  \nPrisoners may appeal a Step I decision to Step II \nif they are unsatisfied with the response or the re-\nsponse was not timely. J.A. 77. MDOC\u2019s response to a \nStep II appeal is due within 90 calendar days of re-\nceipt, absent an extension, and it constitutes the final \ndecision in the matter. J.A. 77.  \nC. District Court Proceedings and Eviden-\ntiary Hearing \nRichards and co-Plaintiffs Kenneth Damon Pruitt \nand Robert Kissee filed suit under \u00a7 1983, alleging \nthat Perttu, a Resident Unit Manager (RUM) for the \nMDOC, sexually harassed them and other prisoners, \n \n1 Every prison has a PREA Coordinator designated by the war-\nden. J.A. 67.  \n\n8 \n \nretaliated against them, and destroyed their property, \nin violation of the First, Fifth, and Eighth Amend-\nments. J.A. 1\u201338. Perttu moved for summary judg-\nment, asserting that Richards and his co-Plaintiffs \nfailed to exhaust administrative remedies before filing \ntheir complaint. Pet. App. 3a. Richards and his co-\nPlaintiffs alleged that Perttu had destroyed their \ngrievances or otherwise prevented them from being \nprocessed, making the grievance process unavailable. \nPet. App. 30a, 37a, 59a\u201360a. \nThe district court denied Perttu\u2019s motion, finding \nthat there was a question of fact as to whether the \ngrievance process was available to Richards due to his \nallegation that Perttu interfered with his grievance \nfilings. Pet. App. 79a\u201381a, 83a.  \nFollowing this ruling, the magistrate judge con-\nducted an evidentiary hearing on the issue of exhaus-\ntion. J.A. 88\u2013368. Evaluating the testimony, evidence, \nand arguments presented, the magistrate judge rec-\nommended that the district court conclude that Perttu \ncarried his burden of establishing \u201cthat Plaintiffs \nfailed to exhaust any of their claims before filing suit,\u201d \nPet. App. 64a, 76a, and that the \u201cadministrative rem-\nedies were generally available\u201d to Richards and his co-\nPlaintiffs. Pet. App. 68a.  \nIn reaching that conclusion, the magistrate judge \nfound that Richards\u2019 direct examinations, which re-\nlied on leading questions, undermined the credibility \nof his witnesses. Pet. App. 69a. The magistrate judge \nthen discussed how the circumstances surrounding \nthe alleged observations of Perttu destroying griev-\nances similarly undermined Plaintiffs\u2019 credibility. Pet. \nApp. 71a\u201373a. Notably, the evidence \u201cdemonstrate[d] \n\n9 \n \nthat RUM Perttu could not, and in fact did not, inter-\ncept and destroy all grievances filed by Plaintiffs in \nthe relevant time\u201d: \n[E]ven on the dates that RUM Perttu worked, \nhe testified that he only works from 7:00am to \n3:30pm. Moreover, RUM Perttu did not work \nseven days a week every week from June 2019 \nto March 2020. Indeed, on at least one of the \ndates on which Richards alleges Perttu de-\nstroyed his grievances, January 1, 2020, \nPerttu testified that he was not working due \nto the New Years holiday. \nPet. App. 73a. \nMoreover, the evidence showed that Richards had \naccess to the grievance process: \nBut even had Perttu been working every hour \nof every day . . . Richards actually took ad-\nvantage of the grievance procedure by filing \nStep I grievance forms twenty-six times be-\ntween June 6, 2019, and April 23, 2020.  \n* * * \nMoreover, of Richards\u2019s six Step I grievance \nforms entered into evidence, three specifically \ngrieved RUM Perttu, undermining any allega-\ntion that Perttu sorted through the grievances \nand discarded those directed towards him.  \nPet. App. 73a\u201374a.  \n\n10 \n \nThe magistrate judge noted that \u201cRichards\u2019s suc-\ncessful use of the grievance procedure . . . directly con-\ntradicts Plaintiffs\u2019 claim that administrative remedies \nwere effectively unavailable, and Plaintiffs\u2019 failure \n[to] use any of the alternative reporting methods . . . \ncasts doubt on their alleged attempts to file PREA \ngrievances.\u201d Pet. App. 75a.  \nThe magistrate judge found that \u201cPlaintiffs pro-\nvided no evidence that RUM Perttu\u201d influenced the \ncorrections officers he supervised to destroy or not \nprocess their grievances. Pet. App. 75a. Indeed, \u201cthe \ncredibility of Plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses was undermined by \ntheir inability to independently recollect the time or \nlocation of RUM Perttu\u2019s alleged destruction of Plain-\ntiff\u2019s grievances, as well as the unlikely circumstances \nunder which they claimed they observed such destruc-\ntion.\u201d Pet. App. 75a\u201376a. For instance, as a matter of \n\u201ccommon sense,\u201d Perttu could not have been \u201cpresent \nto intercept every grievance\u201d filed by Plaintiffs. Pet. \nApp. 76a. Based on these findings, the magistrate \njudge recommended that the district court conclude \nthat Richards and his co-Plaintiffs failed to exhaust \ntheir claims against Perttu and dismiss their claims \nwithout prejudice. Pet. App. 76a.  \nRichards and his co-Plaintiffs filed nine objec-\ntions, which the district court overruled. Pet. App. \n22a\u201328a. The district court adopted the report and \nrecommendation and entered judgment for Perttu. \nPet. App. 29a. Richards alone appealed the district \ncourt\u2019s ruling.  \n\n11 \n \nD. Sixth Circuit Proceedings \nOn appeal, Richards argued that the district court \nerred by not granting him a jury trial to resolve the \nexhaustion issue, which he claimed was intertwined \nwith the merits of his case.  \nThe Sixth Circuit began its analysis by discussing \nwhether the exhaustion issue was intertwined with \nRichards\u2019 underlying retaliation claim, noting that \nRichards alleged that Perttu destroyed his grievances, \npreventing him from exhausting the grievance re-\nquirements. Richards\u2019 complaint, the Sixth Circuit \nsaid, \u201clays out several specific instances when Perttu \nallegedly destroyed grievances that Richards had in-\ntended to file.\u201d Pet. App. 2a\u20133a. This allegedly \u201cinter-\nfered with Richards\u2019s speech.\u201d Pet. App. 10a. Under \nthese circumstances, the court concluded that \u201cthe \nfactual disputes regarding exhaustion . . . are inter-\ntwined with the merits of Richards\u2019s retaliation \nclaim.\u201d Pet. App. 12a. \nThe Sixth Circuit turned its attention to whether \nthis intertwining implicated the Seventh Amendment \nright to a jury trial. The court recognized that, in Lee \nv. Willey, 789 F.3d 673 (6th Cir. 2015), it held that the \nprisoner had no right to a jury trial for an exhaustion \ndefense under the PLRA. Pet. App. 13a. But the court \nnoted that Lee did not govern the present case because \nthe disputed facts of the exhaustion issue were not \n\u201c \u2018bound up with the merits of the underlying dis-\npute.\u2019 \u201d Pet. App. 13a (quoting Lee, 789 F.3d at 678).  \nThe Sixth Circuit then looked to the other circuits, \nnoting that only the Seventh Circuit had squarely ad-\ndressed the issue, in Pavey v. Conley, 544 F.3d 739 \n\n12 \n \n(7th Cir. 2008). There, the Seventh Circuit held that \nprisoners had no right to a jury trial to determine \nwhether they had exhausted their administrative \nremedies under the PLRA, regardless of whether the \nexhaustion issue is intertwined with the merits of the \ncase. Pet. App. 14a (citing Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741\u201342). \nAccording to the Seventh Circuit, \u201c[j]uries decide \ncases, not issues of judicial traffic control.\u201d Pavey, 544 \nF.3d at 741. The Ninth Circuit agreed with the rea-\nsoning of Pavey in Albino v. Baca, 747 F.3d 1162, 1171 \n(9th Cir. 2014) (en banc) (citations omitted). Pet. App. \n14a. \nInstead of following the reasoning of the Seventh \nand Ninth Circuits, the Sixth Circuit found \u201cseveral \ndistrict-court decisions in the Second Circuit\u201d more \nconvincing. Pet. App. 15a\u201317a. It ultimately con-\ncluded that \u201cRichards was stripped of his right to a \njury\u2019s resolution of the ultimate dispute\u201d because he \nwas denied a jury trial on the exhaustion issue. Pet. \nApp. 17a (internal citation omitted). The Sixth Circuit \nalso relied on Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Co. v. Rail-\nway Express Agency, Inc., 253 F.2d 780, 784 (6th Cir. \n1958). Pet. App. 17a\u201319a. In Fireman\u2019s Fund, the \nSixth Circuit had held that when jurisdiction is inter-\ntwined with the merits of the case, the issue cannot be \nsummarily decided where factual claims would not be \nsubject to cross-examination. 253 F.2d at 784 (\u201cthe \nmerits of a controversy could be summarily decided, \npartly on affidavits without the right of cross-exami-\nnation\u201d) (citation omitted). \nThe Sixth Circuit held that the district court erred \nby ordering an evidentiary hearing rather than a jury \ntrial on the issue of exhaustion, \u201cemphasiz[ing] that a \n\n13 \n \njury trial is appropriate in these circumstances only if \nthe district court finds that genuine disputes of mate-\nrial fact concerning PLRA exhaustion are \u2018decisive of \nthe merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claim.\u2019 \u201d Pet. App. 19a \n(quoting Fireman\u2019s Fund, 253 F.2d at 784). \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe PLRA mandates that prisoners exhaust ad-\nministrative remedies before filing a lawsuit in fed-\neral court. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). Despite this precon-\ndition to suit, the Sixth Circuit held that prisoners are \nentitled to a jury trial when exhaustion disputes are \nintertwined with the merits of their claims. This con-\nclusion is not grounded in the Seventh Amendment. \n1. The Seventh Amendment permits courts to re-\nsolve disputed facts bearing on whether prisoners \nhave exhausted their claims. The Amendment pre-\nserves the right to a jury trial as it existed under the \nEnglish common law in 1791. Consistent with the \nAmendment\u2019s language, this Court has adhered to a \n\u201chistorical test,\u201d which asks two questions: (1) \nwhether the cause of action at issue \u201ceither was tried \nat law at the time of the founding or is at least analo-\ngous to one that was,\u201d Markman v. Westview Instru-\nments, Inc., 517 U.S. 370, 376 (1996) (citation omit-\nted), and (2) \u201c[i]f the action in question belongs in the \nlaw category, . . . whether the particular [issue] . . . \nmust fall to the jury in order to preserve the substance \nof the common-law right as it existed in 1791,\u201d id.  \nThis case turns on the second question, which, as \nthis Court has emphasized, \u201cmust depend on whether \nthe jury must shoulder this responsibility as neces-\nsary to preserve the \u2018substance of the common-law \n\n14 \n \nright of trial by jury.\u2019 \u201d Tull v. United States, 481 U.S. \n412, 426 (1987) (quoting Colgrove v. Battin, 413 U.S. \n149, 157 (1973)). The Court answers this question \nmuch like its first\u2014by using a historical method, and \n\u201c[w]here there is no exact antecedent,\u201d by \u201ccomparing \nthe modern practice to earlier ones whose allocation \nto court or jury we do know.\u201d Markman, 517 U.S. at \n378 (citations omitted).  \nExhaustion did not exist in 1791, and it was not \nuntil the twentieth century that courts fully articu-\nlated the doctrine. Thus, there is no exact antecedent \nto look to for answers. But exhaustion\u2019s roots in courts \nof equity provide helpful guidance. Exhaustion was \napplied by those courts to promote an orderly proce-\ndure whereby an administrative forum was the appro-\npriate starting point for a dispute. Other forum-based \nequitable defenses\u2014such as the adequate remedy at \nlaw doctrine, forum non conveniens, abstention, and \nhabeas corpus bars\u2014therefore provide a suitable his-\ntorical analog.  \nAt common law, these defenses were not afforded \na jury trial right. This was true regardless of whether \nthose defenses were interposed in courts of law, in \nwhich case a court of equity would first dispose of the \nissue. Only where an issue at law remained would \nthat issue be jury-triable. Because these equitable de-\nfenses were not subject to a jury determination at \ncommon law, neither should exhaustion.  \nEven if these historical analogs are insufficient, \nfunctional considerations should guide this Court\u2019s \ndecision. In this regard, the PLRA\u2019s goals\u2014\u201cto reduce \nthe quantity and improve the quality of prisoner \nsuits,\u201d \nPorter, \n534 \nU.S. \nat \n524\u2014would \nbe \n\n15 \n \ncompromised, if not outright defeated, by a jury trial \non exhaustion. The PLRA allows prison officials the \nopportunity to address prisoner complaints prior to \nfederal-court interference. This, in turn, obviates the \nneed for some prisoner lawsuits and creates an admin-\nistrative record for those that are filed.  \nJudges also frequently decide threshold issues \nand are thus better positioned than juries to decide \nexhaustion questions. And due to the significant num-\nber of prisoner cases judges see, they are particularly \nwell-equipped to deal with questions about a prison\u2019s \ninternal operations. Consequently, an exhaustion \nquestion should be allocated to the judge, not a jury.  \n2. That a question of exhaustion is intertwined \nwith the merits of a prisoner\u2019s claim does not change \nthis outcome. While Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, \n359 U.S. 500 (1959), establishes a general rule priori-\ntizing legal issues over equitable ones, it is a pruden-\ntial rule that is premised on the recognition that an \nequitable determination could have a collateral-estop-\npel effect on the merits of a legal claim. These con-\ncerns are not present for an exhaustion determina-\ntion, which is a threshold, pre-merits ruling that the \njury may revisit if an exhausted claim goes to trial. \nFurther, this Court has previously considered \nwhether application of the Beacon Theatres rule would \nundermine a federal statute. Here, the PLRA\u2019s pur-\nposes would be severely undercut by a jury trial on ex-\nhaustion.  \nFor these reasons, the Seventh Amendment does \nnot preserve the right to a jury trial on exhaustion of \nadministrative remedies where disputed facts regard-\ning exhaustion are intertwined with merits of a claim. \n\n16 \n \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe Seventh Amendment does not preserve \nthe right to a jury trial on factual questions \nconcerning exhaustion. \nJudges frequently decide disputed questions of \nfact without violating the Seventh Amendment, par-\nticularly with respect to threshold issues. It is thus no \nsurprise that all courts of appeal to have considered \nthe issue have held that \u201cjudges may resolve factual \ndisputes relevant to the exhaustion issue without the \nparticipation of a jury.\u201d Small v. Camden Cnty., 728 \nF.3d 265, 269\u201371 (3d Cir. 2013); see also Lee, 789 F.3d \nat 677\u201378; Albino, 747 F.3d at 1170\u201371; Messa v. \nGoord, 652 F.3d 305, 308\u201310 (2d Cir. 2011) (per cu-\nriam); Dillon v. Rogers, 596 F.3d 260, 270\u201372 (5th Cir. \n2010); Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741\u201342; Bryant v. Rich, 530 \nF.3d 1368, 1373\u201377 (11th Cir. 2008). These holdings \nare consistent with the Seventh Amendment, which \napplies only to issues tried by a jury in suits at com-\nmon law in 1791. Exhaustion, although unknown at \ncommon law, is rooted in equity and closely analogous \nto traditional equitable defenses, which were not his-\ntorically determined by juries.  \nA. This Court has held that judges can de-\ncide facts related to threshold issues\u2014\nlike exhaustion\u2014without violating the \nSeventh Amendment.  \nAs a general matter, \u201cissues of law are to be re-\nsolved by the court and issues of fact are to be deter-\nmined by the jury.\u201d Baltimore & Carolina Line, Inc. v. \nRedman, 295 U.S. 654, 657 (1935). But this broad \nproposition overstates the Amendment\u2019s sweep, for \n\n17 \n \n\u201cthe Seventh Amendment was never intended to es-\ntablish the jury as the exclusive mechanism for fact-\nfinding in civil cases.\u201d Atlas Roofing Co. v. Occupa-\ntional Safety & Health Review Comm\u2019n, 430 U.S. 442, \n460 (1977); see also Galloway v. United States, 319 \nU.S. 372, 390 (1943) (\u201cThe jury was not absolute mas-\nter of fact in 1791.\u201d). In this vein, this Court has held \nthat the Seventh Amendment \u201cwas designed to pre-\nserve the basic institution of jury trial in only its most \nfundamental elements, not the great mass of proce-\ndural forms and details, varying even then [in 1791] \nso widely among common-law jurisdictions.\u201d Gallo-\nway, 319 U.S. at 392; see also Walker v. N. M. & S. P. \nR. Co., 165 U.S. 593, 596 (1897) (\u201cThe seventh amend-\nment . . . does not attempt to regulate matters of \npleading or practice[.]\u201d).  \nJudges thus frequently decide disputed questions \nof fact without violating the Seventh Amendment. For \nexample, this Court has held that judges may decide \nquestions of fact related to subject-matter jurisdiction, \nWetmore v. Rymer, 169 U.S. 115, 120\u201322 (1898); dis-\ncovery disputes, Herbert v. Lando, 441 U.S. 153, 177 \n(1979); class certifications, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. \nDukes, 564 U.S. 338, 351\u201352 (2011); evidentiary objec-\ntions, Galloway, 319 U.S. at 390; motions for sum-\nmary judgment, Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 \nU.S. 322, 336 (1979); motions for directed verdict, Gal-\nloway, 283 U.S. at 391\u201395; and motions to set aside \nthe verdict, Gasoline Products Co. v. Champlin Refin-\ning Co., 283 U.S. 494, 497\u201398 (1943).  \n \n \n\n18 \n \nThis makes sense for at least two reasons. First, a \njudge\u2019s ability to determine fact disputes related to \nthreshold questions is consistent with the under-\nstanding that \u201c \u2018[t]he Seventh Amendment does not \nconfer the right to a trial, but only the right to have a \njury hear the case once it is determined that the litiga-\ntion should proceed before a court.\u2019 \u201d Caley v. Gulf-\nstream Aerospace Corp., 428 F.3d 1359, 1371 (11th \nCir. 2005) (quoting Am. Heritage Life Ins. Co. v. Orr, \n294 F.3d 702, 711 (5th Cir. 2002)), cert. denied, 548 \nU.S. 1128 (2006). In this sense a judge acts as a gate-\nkeeper, guarding the courthouse doors from those who \nseek entry but have not yet satisfied mandatory pre-\nconditions to suit. Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741 (\u201cJuries de-\ncide cases, not issues of judicial traffic control.\u201d).  \nSecond, and relatedly, \u201c[t]he limitation imposed \nby the [Seventh] [A]mendment is merely that enjoy-\nment of the right of trial by jury be not obstructed, and \nthat the ultimate determination of issues of fact by the \njury be not interfered with.\u201d In re Peterson, 253 U.S. \n300, 310 (1920) (emphasis added). In other words, the \nSeventh Amendment \u201cis concerned with substance \nand not with form.\u201d Dimick v. Schiedt, 293 U.S. 474, \n490 (1935); see also id. (\u201cThere is nothing in its history \nor language to suggest that the amendment had any \npurpose but to preserve the essentials of the jury trial \nas it was known to the common law before the adop-\ntion of the Constitution.\u201d); Walker, 165 U.S. at 596 \n(\u201cSo long as this substance of right is preserved, the \nprocedure by which this result shall be reached is \nwholly within the discretion of the legislature . . . .\u201d). \nWhere the jury\u2019s ultimate determination of the facts is \nnot obviated, the judge may serve as factfinder. \n\n19 \n \nBoth of these underpinnings apply with full force \nin the exhaustion context. Exhaustion is a threshold \nquestion. Under the PLRA, \u201c[u]ntil the issue of ex-\nhaustion is resolved, the court cannot know whether \nit is to decide the case or the prison authorities are to.\u201d \nPavey, 544 F.3d at 741. Further, a judge\u2019s exhaustion \ndetermination does not interfere with a jury\u2019s ulti-\nmate factfinding responsibility because dismissals for \nfailure to exhaust are generally without prejudice.2 \nSee Snider v. Melindez, 199 F.3d 108, 111\u201312 (2d Cir. \n1999) (explaining that exhaustion \u201cis often a tempo-\nrary, curable, procedural flaw\u201d). A prisoner may later \nrefile the lawsuit, so long as the prison\u2019s grievance \nprocedure is satisfied. And if the prisoner\u2019s case ulti-\nmately proceeds to trial, the jury may revisit facts \nfound by the judge that may have been relevant to the \nexhaustion determination. See Part II; see also Pavey, \n544 F.3d at 742.  \nB. The Seventh Amendment does not pre-\nserve the right to a jury trial on any fac-\ntual questions concerning exhaustion be-\ncause exhaustion derives from equity.  \nAlthough the types of claims Richards brought are \nthose to which a jury trial applies, this Court has \n \n2 Along these lines, some courts have identified exhaustion as \nmatter in abatement, Bryant, 530 F.3d at 1374; Small, 728 F.3d \nat 269 n.3 (citation omitted), which is unsurprising since \u201cabate-\nment defense[s] defeat the particular action for procedural de-\nfects that are unrelated to the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claim,\u201d and \nthe plaintiff can therefore \u201ctypically correct the defects and pro-\nceed in another action,\u201d Hyman v. City of Gastonia, 466 F.3d 284, \n287 (4th Cir. 2006) (citing Bowles v. Wilke, 175 F.2d 35, 38 (7th \nCir. 1949)).  \n\n20 \n \nrecognized the need for a separate historical analysis \nfor particular issues or trial decisions within jury-ap-\npropriate claims. Under this analysis, there is no ex-\nact antecedent for exhaustion. But its equitable ori-\ngins and the characteristics of the doctrine show that \nits closest parallel lies in equitable defenses\u2014which \nwere historically decided by judges, not juries.  \n1. The Seventh Amendment guarantees \na jury trial right only as to issues \ntried by a jury in suits at common law \nat the time the Seventh Amendment \nwas adopted.  \nThe Seventh Amendment \u201cpreserve[s]\u201d the right \nto jury trial \u201c[i]n Suits at common law.\u201d U.S. Const. \namend. VII. Because the Amendment speaks in terms \nof preservation, this Court has long held that the \nscope of the right must be determined by reference to \nhistory. Indeed, \u201c[f]rom the beginning, it has been re-\ngarded as but subservient to the single purpose of the \nAmendment, to preserve the essentials of the jury \ntrial in actions at law, serving to distinguish them \nfrom suits in equity and admiralty[.]\u201d Dimick, 293 \nU.S. at 490\u201391 (citation omitted); Granfinanciera, \nS.A. v. Nordberg, 492 U.S. 33, 42 (1989) (explaining \nthat the Seventh Amendment applies to actions \u201cthat \nare analogous to common-law causes of action ordi-\nnarily decided in English law courts in the late 18th \ncentury, as opposed to those customarily heard by \ncourts of equity or admiralty\u201d) (citation omitted). Con-\nsistent with this command, \u201cresort must be had to the \nappropriate rules of the common law established at \nthe time of the adoption of that constitutional provi-\nsion in 1791.\u201d Dimick, 293 U.S. at 476. See also \n\n21 \n \nBaltimore & Carolina Line, Inc., 295 U.S. at 657 \n(\u201c[T]he right of trial by jury thus preserved is the right \nwhich existed under the English common law when \nthe Amendment was adopted.\u201d).  \nThis historical lens does not mean that the right \nto a jury trial is available only in suits \u201cwhich the com-\nmon law recognized among its old and settled proceed-\nings.\u201d Parsons v. Bedford, Breedlove & Robeson, 28 \nU.S. 433, 447 (1830). As this Court has noted, histori-\ncal analysis allows for reasoning by analogy. There-\nfore, the determination whether the Seventh Amend-\nment confers a right to a jury trial entails a two-part \ninquiry. A court first considers whether it is \u201c \u2018dealing \nwith a cause of action that either was tried at law at \nthe time of the founding or is at least analogous to one \nthat was.\u2019 \u201d City of Monterey v. Del Monte Dunes at \nMonterey, Ltd., 526 U.S. 687, 708 (1999) (quoting \nMarkman, 517 U.S. at 376). If a court determines that \n\u201cthe action in question belongs in the law category,\u201d it \nmust \u201cthen ask whether the particular trial decision \nmust fall to the jury in order to preserve the substance \nof the common-law right as it existed in 1791.\u201d Mark-\nman, 517 U.S. at 708 (emphasis added). See also Tull, \n481 U.S. at 426 (\u201c \u2018Only those incidents which are re-\ngarded as fundamental, as inherent in and of the es-\nsence of the system of trial by jury, are placed beyond \nthe reach of the legislature.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting Colgrove, 413 \nU.S. at 156 n.11.).  \nAs applied to this case, the first inquiry is \nstraightforward. While the scope of prisoners\u2019 federal \nrights was significantly limited at common law, see, \ne.g., Ruffin v. Commonwealth, 62 Va. 790, 799 (1871); \nBethea v. Crouse, 417 F.2d 504, 505 (10th Cir. 1969), \n\n22 \n \nfollowing Del Monte Dunes, 526 U.S. at 720\u201321, the \ntypes of claims that Richards brought\u2014\u00a7 1983 claims \nfor damages\u2014are those for which a jury trial applies.  \nThis conclusion is not the end of the inquiry, \nthough. Rather, it leads to the second question\u2014\nwhether the particular issue of exhaustion is \u201cproper \nfor determination by the jury.\u201d3 Id. at 718; see also id. \nat 731 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and in concurring \nin the judgment) (\u201cTo say that respondents had the \nright to a jury trial on their \u00a7 1983 claim is not to say \nthat they were entitled to have the jury decide every \nissue.\u201d); Google LLC v. Oracle Am., Inc. 593 U.S. 1, 25 \n(2021) (rejecting an argument that the jury should de-\ncide a fair-use defense). As explained below, it is not.  \n2. Exhaustion did not exist at the com-\nmon law, but closely analogous equi-\ntable issues were not decided by ju-\nries in 1791.  \nTo answer the second question\u2014whether exhaus-\ntion should be determined by a judge or jury\u2014this \nCourt again looks to history, asking \u201cwhether the par-\nticular issue, or analogous ones, were decided by judge \nor by jury in suits at common law at the time the Sev-\nenth Amendment was adopted.\u201d Del Monte Dunes, 526 \nU.S. at 718; see also Markman, 517 U.S. at 378 \n(\u201cWhere there is no exact antecedent, the best hope \n \n3 The practice of submitting some issues for judicial determina-\ntion, while others are submitted to the jury, is consistent with \nFed. R. Civ. P. 39(a) and (a)(2), which provides that a \u201ctrial on all \nissues so demanded must be by jury unless . . . the court . . . finds \nthat on some or all of those issues there is no federal right to a \njury trial.\u201d (Emphasis added).  \n\n23 \n \nlies in comparing the modern practice to earlier ones \nwhose allocation to court or jury we do know . . . seek-\ning the best analogy we can draw between an old and \nthe new.\u201d) (citations omitted); Tull, 481 U.S. at 420\u2013\n21 (explaining that courts must search the common \nlaw for \u201cappropriate analogies\u201d instead of a \u201cprecisely \nanalogous common-law cause of action\u201d). \nAlthough no exact antecedent for exhaustion ex-\nisted at common law, its origins lie in equity. These \norigins and exhaustion\u2019s characteristics result in an \nappropriate analog\u2014equitable defenses\u2014for which \nthere was no traditional right to a jury trial. \na. No historical antecedent to exhaustion \nexisted at common law, but its origins \nare equitable in nature. \nThe doctrine of exhaustion \u201cis as old as federal ad-\nministrative law,\u201d meaning that it did not begin to \ntake shape until the creation of the Interstate Com-\nmerce Commission in 1887. Raoul Berger, Exhaustion \nof Administrative Remedies, 48 Yale L.J. 981, 981 n.1 \n(1939). Intended as a rule of \u201corderly\u201d procedure de-\nsigned to allow administrative bodies to perform their \nstatutory functions without preliminary interference \nfrom the courts, United States v. Sing Tuck, 194 U.S. \n161, 168 (1904), the concept first arose in tax cases in \nwhich courts of equity refused to grant injunctive re-\nlief where a plaintiff failed to pursue administrative \nremedies.  \nIn Dundee Mortgage Trust Invest Co. v. Charlton, \n32 F. 192, 192\u201393 (C.C.D. Ore. 1887), for example, a \ncorporation brought suit in equity to enjoin the \n\n24 \n \ncollection of its taxes, arguing that the county asses-\nsor and county board of equalization had erred in their \nassessment. While the court agreed that the corpora-\ntion \u201cappear[ed] to be entitled to an injunction,\u201d id. at \n193, it nevertheless held that the corporation was not \nentitled to relief because it did not seek redress from \nthe county board of equalization, as provided by stat-\nute, id. at 193\u201394. \u201c[T]he plaintiff, having neglected to \navail itself of this means of redress, cannot maintain \na suit for relief in this court.\u201d Id. at 195; see also Alt-\nschul v. Gittings, 86 F. 200, 202 (C.C.D. Ore. 1898) \n(No. 2,236) (same); Brown v. Drain, 112 F. 582, 585 \n(C.C.S.D. Cal. 1901) (\u201cThe remedy of one who consid-\ners himself unfairly assessed is to apply for redress to \nthe statutory tribunal, if one is provided with the \npower to review.\u201d).  \nThe exhaustion concept was applied in courts of \nequity in other contexts as well. In Sing Tuck, an im-\nmigration case in which the Court denied a writ a ha-\nbeas corpus, the Court concluded that the petitioner \nfailed to comply with the \u201cmode of procedure which \nmust be followed before there can be resort to the \ncourts.\u201d 194 U.S. at 167. Explaining that \u201cit is one of \nthe necessities of the administration of justice that \neven fundamental questions should be determined in \nan orderly way,\u201d the Court reasoned that the peti-\ntioner failed to first file an appeal with the Secretary \nof Commerce and Labor. Id. at 168. The Court analo-\ngized the exhaustion requirement to habeas corpus \ncases arising out of state confinement:  \nA familiar illustration is that of a person im-\nprisoned upon criminal process by a state \ncourt, under a state law alleged to be \n\n25 \n \nunconstitutional. If the law is unconstitu-\ntional the prisoner is wrongfully held. Yet, ex-\ncept under exceptional circumstances, the \ncourts of the United States do not interfere by \nhabeas corpus. The prisoner must, in the first \nplace, take his case to the highest court of the \nstate to which he can go, and after that he gen-\nerally is left to the remedy by writ of error if \nhe wishes to bring the case here.  \nId. (citations omitted). Because the petitioner failed to \nfirst resort to his administrative remedy, any attempt \n\u201cto swamp the courts by resort to them in the first in-\nstance[ ] must fail.\u201d Id. at 170; see also id. (\u201c[B]efore \nthe courts can be called upon, the preliminary sifting \nprocess provided by the statutes must be gone through \nwith. Whether after that a further trial may be had \nwe do not decide.\u201d). Other cases highlight exhaustion\u2019s \nequitable origins. E.g. Pittsburgh Ry. v. Bd. of Pub. \nWorks, 172 U.S. 32, 47 (1898); United States v. Abilene \n& S. Ry. Co., 265 U.S. 274, 282 (1924); United States \nv. Ill. Cent. R.R. Co., 291 U.S. 457, 463 (1934); Natural \nGas Pipeline Co. v. Slattery, 302 U.S. 300, 310\u201311 \n(1937).  \nWhile these cases confirm exhaustion\u2019s equitable \norigins, the doctrine, as we understand it today, did \nnot fully emerge until the twentieth century. See John \nF. Duffy, Administrative Common Law in Judicial Re-\nview, 77 Tex. L. Rev. 113, 154 (1998) (explaining that \n\u201c[i]n the early part of th[e] [twentieth] century, the \ndoctrine was still quite amorphous, and as late as the \n1920\u2019s, courts were still using other equitable doc-\ntrines . . . to decide cases that would later be consid-\nered exhaustion precedents\u201d). Indeed, it was only in \n\n26 \n \n1938, in Myers v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Co., 303 \nU.S. 41 (1938), that this Court expressly articulated \nthe modern underpinning of the doctrine. See Duffy, \nsupra, at 155.  \nIn Myers, the Court declined a request to enjoin \nthe National Labor Relations Board\u2019s administrative \nproceedings despite allegations that the NLRB lacked \njurisdiction. Id. at 43, 46. The Court refused to grant \ninjunctive relief, in part on the ground that \u201cno one is \nentitled to judicial relief for a supposed or threatened \ninjury until the prescribed administrative remedy has \nbeen exhausted.\u201d Id. at 50. The Court recognized the \nexhaustion doctrine\u2019s equitable roots, see id. at 51 n.9 \n(\u201cThe rule has been most frequently applied in equity \nwhere relief by injunction was sought\u201d) (citation omit-\nted), and noted the extension of the doctrine to courts \nof law, id. (\u201cbecause the rule is one of judicial admin-\nistration\u2014not merely a rule governing the exercise of \ndiscretion\u2014it is applicable to proceedings at law as \nwell as suits in equity\u201d) (citations omitted). Myers \nstands as \u201cthe seminal decision\u201d on the exhaustion \ndoctrine and has been described as \u201ccomplet[ing] the \ndoctrine\u2019s evolution.\u201d Duffy, supra, at 155. \nIn short, although exhaustion has deep roots in \nequity, the doctrine as we know it today was unknown \nin the late eighteenth century. Consequently, there is \nno \u201cclear historical evidence that the very . . . ques-\ntion\u201d of exhaustion was a question for the jury under \nthe common law. Markman, 517 U.S. at 377. \n\n27 \n \nb. Traditional equitable defenses such as \nadequate remedy at law, forum non \nconveniens, abstention, and habeas \ncorpus bars are an appropriate com-\nmon-law analog for exhaustion.  \nWith no precise analog existing in the English \ncommon law, \u201cthe best hope lies in comparing the \nmodern practice to earlier ones whose allocation to \ncourt or jury we do know, . . . seeking the best analogy \nwe can draw between the old and the new.\u201d Markman, \n517 U.S. at 378 (citations omitted). In this regard, this \nCourt has instructed that the analog be \u201cappropriate\u201d \nrather than \u201cprecise[ ],\u201d Tull, 481 U.S. at 420\u201321, and \ncan be drawn on the basis of function, Markman, 517 \nU.S. at 379\u201380.  \nExhaustion\u2019s foundations in courts of equity pro-\nvide a logical starting point in the search for an appro-\npriate analog. As explained in the prior section, from \nits earliest articulations, it was viewed as a limitation, \nalbeit discretionary, on a court\u2019s equitable jurisdic-\ntion. See Charlton, 32 F. at 195; Altschul, 86 F. at 202. \nIn other words, a court of equity would not exercise its \nextraordinary powers where a plaintiff failed to avail \nitself of an available administrative process. Gorham \nMfg. Co. v. State Tax Comm\u2019n of N.Y., 266 U.S. 265, \n270 (1924) (holding that the petitioner, \u201chaving failed \nto avail itself of the administrative remedy provided \nby the statute . . . was not entitled to maintain a bill \nin equity\u201d); Ill. Cent. R.R. Co., 291 U.S. at 463 (\u201cThe \nvarious steps to be taken constitute parts of the ad-\nministrative process which must be completed before \nthe extraordinary powers of a court of equity may be \ninvoked.\u201d) (citation omitted); Slattery, 302 U.S. 300, \n310\u201311 (1937) (\u201cThe rule that a suitor must exhaust \n\n28 \n \nhis administrative remedies before seeking the ex-\ntraordinary relief of a court of equity . . . is of special \nforce when resort is had to the federal courts to re-\nstrain the action of state officers.\u201d) (citations omitted); \nIsland Creek Coal Co. v. Bryan, 937 F.3d 738, 748 (6th \nCir. 2019) (noting that \u201cthe exhaustion \u2018doctrine had \nits origin in a discretionary rule adopted by courts of \nequity to the effect that a petitioner will be denied eq-\nuitable relief when he has failed to pursue an availa-\nble administrative remedy by which he might obtain \nthe same relief.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting Smith v. United States, \n199 F.2d 377, 381 (1st Cir. 1952)).  \nThus, historically, exhaustion was an equitable \ndefense applied by courts when another forum\u2014an \nadministrative tribunal or agency\u2014was the more ap-\npropriate starting point for a dispute. Tracking this \nprinciple, this Court has said that exhaustion \u201cserves \nthe twin purposes of protecting administrative agency \nauthority and promoting judicial efficiency.\u201d McCar-\nthy v. Madigan, 503 U.S. 140, 145 (1992), superseded \nby statute, \u00a7 1997e(a), as recognized in Woodford, 548 \nU.S. at 84\u201385. As to the first purpose, the exhaustion \nrequirement \u201crecognizes the notion, grounded in def-\nerence to Congress\u2019 delegation of authority to coordi-\nnate branches of Government, that agencies, not the \ncourts, ought to have primary responsibility for the \nprograms that Congress has charged them to admin-\nister.\u201d Id.; see id. (\u201cThe exhaustion doctrine recognizes \nthe commonsense notion of dispute resolution that an \nagency ought to have an opportunity to correct its own \nmistakes . . . before it is haled into federal court.\u201d) (em-\nphasis added); Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 492 \n(1973) (\u201cSince the[ ] internal problems of state prisons \ninvolve issues so peculiarly within state authority and \n\n29 \n \nexpertise, the States have an important interest in not \nbeing bypassed in the correction of those problems.\u201d). \nAs to the second purpose, \u201c[w]hen an agency has the \nopportunity to correct its own errors, a judicial contro-\nversy may well be mooted, or at least piecemeal ap-\npeals may be avoided.\u201d McCarthy, 503 U.S. at 145 (ci-\ntations omitted).  \nThese twin purposes call back to early articula-\ntions of the exhaustion doctrine as a rule of \u201corderly\u201d \nprocedure. Sing Tuck, 194 U.S. at 168, 173. And alt-\nhough the exhaustion doctrine was discretionary, as \nopposed to jurisdictional, Slattery, 302 U.S. at 311 (ex-\nplaining that the rule \u201crests in the sound discretion \nwhich guides exercise of equity jurisdiction\u201d) (cita-\ntions omitted); Abilene & S. Ry. Co., 265 U.S. at 282, \nit nevertheless was treated by courts of equity as a \nthreshold inquiry, see Sing Tuck, 194 U.S. at 168, 170.  \nThese guideposts offer a clear path in the search \nfor an appropriate common law analog. Indeed, ex-\nhaustion\u2019s origins as a forum-based equitable defense \ncall to mind other similar equitable defenses\u2014the ad-\nequate remedy at law doctrine, forum non conveniens, \nabstention, and habeas corpus bars.  \nAdequate remedy at law. The adequate remedy at \nlaw doctrine was a fundamental principle guiding \ncourts of equity. These courts \u201cstood ready to fashion \nremedies for legal wrongs, so long as the basic require-\nments of equity\u2014such as irreparable injury and no \nadequate remedy at law\u2014were met.\u201d Duffy, supra, at \n124. See also Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 43\u201344 \n(1971) (\u201cOne is the basic doctrine of equity jurispru-\ndence that courts of equity should not act . . . when the \nmoving party has an adequate remedy at law and will \n\n30 \n \nnot suffer irreparable injury if denied equitable re-\nlief.\u201d); Morales v.

Huffman, 319 U.S. 293, 297 (1943) (cita-\ntion omitted), as well as in state proceedings, Trainor \nv. Hernandez, 431 U.S. 434, 441 (1977). This doctrine, \nlike exhaustion, thus focused on whether a court of eq-\nuity should defer to another court (or forum) to hear \nthe dispute. And, like exhaustion, courts viewed the \ndoctrine as a threshold issue. Brown, Bonnell & Co. v. \nLake Superior Iron Co., 134 U.S. 530, 536 (1890) (ex-\nplaining that the adequate remedy at law objection \n\u201cshould be taken at the earliest opportunity\u201d). \nForum non conveniens. Under this equitable, com-\nmon-law doctrine, a federal court may dismiss an ac-\ntion in favor of an alternative forum when, among \nother things, \u201cthe chosen forum [is] inappropriate be-\ncause of considerations affecting the court\u2019s own ad-\nministration and legal problems.\u201d Koster v. Am. Lum-\nbermens Mut. Cas. Co., 330 U.S. 518, 524 (1947); see \nalso Gulf Oil Corp. v.

Both fo-\nrum non conveniens and exhaustion therefore permit \ncourts to consider judicial efficiency in deciding \n\n31 \n \nwhether they are the appropriate forum for a case to \nbe heard. See Sinochem Int\u2019l Co. v. Malaysia Int\u2019l \nShipping Corp., 549 U.S. 422, 432 (2007) (\u201cA district \ncourt . . . may dispose of an action by a forum non con-\nveniens dismissal, bypassing questions of subject-mat-\nter and personal jurisdiction, when considerations of \nconvenience, fairness, and judicial economy so war-\nrant.\u201d).  \nAbstention. \u201c[E]xhaustion of administrative reme-\ndies\u201d in general and \u201cabstention\u201d are \u201crelated doc-\ntrines.\u201d McCarthy, 503 U.S. at 144. As with exhaus-\ntion, the power of a federal court to dismiss a case via \nabstention \u201cderives from the discretion historically \nenjoyed by courts of equity.\u201d Quackenbush v. Allstate \nIns. Co., 517 U.S. 706, 728 (1996). The driving princi-\nples behind exhaustion and abstention also share a \ncommon root\u2014deference to state or administrative \nauthority. See id. at 728 (quoting Burford v. Sun Oil \nCo., 319 U.S. 315, 334 (1943)). Younger abstention, for \nexample, respects a \u201cState\u2019s interest in pursuing an \nongoing state proceeding,\u201d Ohio Bureau of Emp. \nServs. v. Hodory, 431 U.S. 471, 477 (1977) (citations \nomitted), barring a federal court from enjoining a \nstate prosecution, a civil enforcement action, or a \nunique state action that \u201cimplicate[s] a State\u2019s inter-\nest in enforcing the orders and judgments of its \ncourts,\u201d Sprint Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v. Jacobs, 571 U.S. 69, \n72\u201373 (2013). Likewise, PLRA exhaustion requires a \nfederal court to stay its hand where a state has not \nhad its full opportunity to regulate its own prisons by \nconsidering a prisoner\u2019s grievance. \nHabeas Corpus. Federal habeas principles rein-\nforce the analogy between exhaustion and equitable \n\n32 \n \ndefenses. Indeed, this Court explicitly linked PLRA \nexhaustion requirements to certain habeas defenses, \ndeeming them \u201csubstantively similar.\u201d Woodford, 548 \nU.S. at 92; see also Schlesinger v. Councilman, 420 \nU.S. 738, 756 (1975) (noting that \u201cthe practical consid-\nerations supporting . . . the exhaustion requirement in \nhabeas corpus . . . are similar to those that underlie \nthe requirement of exhaustion of administrative rem-\nedies\u201d) (citation omitted).  \nHabeas exhaustion, like PLRA exhaustion, \nsounds in equity. Withrow v. Williams, 507 U.S. 680, \n699 (1993) (\u201cConcerns for equity and federalism reso-\nnate throughout our habeas jurisprudence.\u201d) (Scalia, \nJ., concurring in part); Erica Hashimoto, Reclaiming \nthe Equitable Heritage of Habeas, 108 Nw. U. L. Rev. \n139, 142 (2013) (habeas defenses \u201cshare features that \ncorrespond with the [habeas] remedy\u2019s historical equi-\ntable origins\u201d). Premised on the same equitable under-\npinnings as administrative exhaustion, habeas ex-\nhaustion requires a prisoner to avail himself of all \n\u201cavailable\u201d state-court remedies before entering fed-\neral court to seek a writ of habeas corpus. 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2254(c); see also O\u2019Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U.S. \n838, 847 (1999). \nThe doctrine of procedural default, 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2254(b)(1)(A), (c), another limitation on habeas re-\nlief, also shares similarities with exhaustion. It pre-\nvents federal court review of a claim that has not been \nproperly presented to the state courts. Woodford, 548 \nU.S. at 92. Procedural default guards against \u201cover-\nturning a state-court conviction without the state \ncourts having had an opportunity to correct the con-\nstitutional violation in the first instance.\u201d Id. (quoting \n\n33 \n \nO\u2019Sullivan, 526 U.S. at 845). That requirement mir-\nrors PLRA exhaustion\u2014giving prison systems the op-\nportunity to correct violations before litigating in fed-\neral court. See Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509, 518\u201319 \n(1982). \n3. Juries did not historically determine \nquestions of fact related to equitable \ndefenses analogous to exhaustion.  \nWith these similarities in mind, these equitable \ndefenses offer a sound analog to exhaustion, and \neighteenth-century practices concerning these de-\nfenses are instructive. It is well understood that a \nplaintiff is not entitled to have a jury determine a dis-\nputed affirmative defense that is equitable in nature. \nLiberty Oil Co. v. Condon Nat\u2019l Bank, 260 U.S. 235, \n242\u201343 (1922) (\u201cThe equitable defense makes the is-\nsue equitable, and it is to be tried to the judge as a \nchancellor.\u201d); Tull, 481 U.S. at 417 (\u201c[T]hose actions \nthat are analogous to 18th-century cases tried in \ncourts of equity . . . do not require a jury trial.\u201d) (cita-\ntion omitted); Granite State Ins. Co. v. Smart Modular \nTechs., 76 F.3d 1023, 1027 (9th Cir. 1996) (\u201cA litigant \nis not entitled to have a jury resolve a disputed affirm-\native defense if the defense is equitable in nature.\u201d) \n(citation omitted); Smith v. World Ins. Co., 38 F.3d \n1456, 1462 (8th Cir. 1994) (\u201c[T]he determination of eq-\nuitable defenses and equitable remedies is a matter \nfor the court to decide, not the jury.\u201d). This was true \neven where an equitable defense was \u201cinterposed in \n[an] action at law,\u201d in which circumstance the equita-\nble defense was generally \u201cfirst . . . disposed of as in a \ncourt of equity, and then, if an issue at law remain[ed], \nit [was] triable to a jury.\u201d Liberty Oil Co., 260 U.S. at \n\n34 \n \n242 (citations omitted). This equity-first order of oper-\nations was laid out by this Court over 100 years ago:  \nThe same order is preserved as under the sys-\ntem of separate courts. If a defendant at law \nhad an equitable defense, he resorted to a bill \nin equity to enjoin the suit at law, until he \ncould make his equitable defense effective by \na hearing before the chancellor. The hearing \non that bill was before the chancellor, and not \nbefore a jury, and, if the prayer of the bill was \ngranted, the injunction against the suit at law \nwas made perpetual, and no jury trial ensued. \nIf the injunction was denied, the suit at law \nproceeded to verdict and judgment. This was \nthe practice in the courts of law and chancery \nin England when our Constitution and the \nSeventh Amendment were adopted, and it is \nin the light of such practice that the Seventh \nAmendment is to be construed. \nId. at 243.  \n* * * \nIn sum, exhaustion was not part of the common \nlaw in 1791, and it has its origins in equity. This his-\ntorical background, along with exhaustion\u2019s func-\ntional similarities to forum-based equitable defenses \nsuch as adequate remedy at law, forum non conven-\niens, abstention, and habeas bars\u2014all historically \nnon-jury issues\u2014leads to the conclusion that the Sev-\nenth Amendment does not require juries to try ex-\nhaustion inquiries.  \n\n35 \n \n4. Functional considerations demon-\nstrate that judges, not juries, should \ndetermine exhaustion questions.  \nEven if history did not provide a clear answer, this \nCourt can, as a last resort, \u201clook elsewhere\u201d\u2015including \nat \u201cstatutory policies\u201d and the respective skills of \njudges and juries\u2015to inform the proper allocation be-\ntween a court or jury for purposes of the Seventh \nAmendment. Markman, 517 U.S. at 384; see also Del \nMonte Dunes, 526 U.S. at 718 (citation omitted). \nBeginning with the statutory policies at issue, the \nPLRA\u2019s statutory history is well documented. \u201cCon-\ngress enacted the [PLRA] . . . in 1996 in the wake of a \nsharp rise in prisoner litigation in the federal courts.\u201d \nWoodford, 548 U.S. at 84 (citing Alexander, 159 F.3d \nat 1324\u201325). The statute thus contains a variety of \ngatekeeping provisions \u201cdesigned to bring this litiga-\ntion under control.\u201d Id. (citations omitted). A \u201ccenter-\npiece\u201d of this effort is the PLRA\u2019s exhaustion require-\nment. Id. (citation omitted). \nThe PLRA\u2019s exhaustion requirement was, \u201cbeyond \ndoubt,\u201d \u201cenacted . . . to reduce the quantity and im-\nprove the quality of prisoner suits[.]\u201d Porter, 534 U.S. \nat 524. To this end, the provision \u201cafford[s] corrections \nofficials time and opportunity to address complaints \ninternally before allowing the initiation of a federal \ncase.\u201d Id. at 525 (emphasis added); see also Woodford, \n548 U.S. at 93 (\u201cThe PLRA attempts to eliminate un-\nwarranted federal-court interference with the admin-\nistration of prisons . . . .\u201d). This might \u201cobviat[e] the \nneed for litigation\u201d in some instances, or it might \u201cfil-\nter out some frivolous claims.\u201d Porter, 534 U.S. at 525 \n(citing Booth, 532 U.S. at 737). For cases that do make \n\n36 \n \nit to court, \u201cadjudication could be facilitated by an ad-\nministrative record that clarifies the contours of the \ncontroversy.\u201d Id. (citing Booth, 532 U.S. at 737); see \nalso Woodford, 548 U.S. at 95 (\u201cWhen a grievance is \nfiled shortly after the event giving rise to the griev-\nance, witnesses can be identified and questioned while \nmemories are still fresh, and evidence can be gathered \nand preserved.\u201d). These goals mirror the purposes of \ntraditional administrative exhaustion\u2014they safe-\nguard \u201cadministrative agency authority and pro-\nmot[e] judicial efficiency.\u201d McCarthy, 503 U.S. at 145.  \nThese goals would be severely undercut if a court \nwere to permit an exhaustion question to go to the \njury. Prison officials would be denied the opportunity \nto address and potentially rectify complaints inter-\nnally. Unexhausted claims could proceed to discovery \nwithout the benefits of full administrative record. \nMost critically, exhaustion questions would require ei-\nther a mini-jury trial before the merits adjudication or \na jury trial heard simultaneously with the merits. In \neither scenario, judicial resources and jurors\u2019 time \nwould be expended on claims that should never have \nreached the courthouse doors. Such a result directly \ncontradicts the PLRA\u2019s aims. \nOn the second point, judges\u2019 established role as \ngatekeepers in prisoner lawsuits supports the conclu-\nsion that judges, not juries, are \u201cbetter suited\u201d to as-\ncertain a prisoner\u2019s compliance with the exhaustion \nrequirement. See Markman, 517 U.S. at 384, 388\u201389 \n(consulting \u201cexisting precedent\u201d and considering \u201cthe \nrelative interpretive skills of judges and juries\u201d); Del \nMonte Dunes, 526 U.S. at 720 (looking to \u201cconsidera-\ntions of process and function\u201d). As explained in Part \n\n37 \n \nI(A), judges routinely resolve threshold issues and act \nas gatekeepers on factual questions that would other-\nwise be presented to the jury. This is especially true \nin PLRA cases, where, due to the sheer volume of pris-\noner lawsuits, Alexander, 159 F.3d at 1324, judges are \nwell-acquainted with the internal operations of prison \nsystems and their multi-level grievance processes. \nThe screening requirement of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A rein-\nforces this notion, as judges already ensure compli-\nance with other aspects of the PLRA. This knowledge \nbase has well prepared the judiciary to settle ques-\ntions surrounding exhaustion under the PLRA. \nThese considerations provide sufficient reason to \ntreat the disposition of questions of fact concerning ex-\nhaustion like many other factfinding responsibilities \nceded to judges in the normal course of litigation.  \nII. The Seventh Amendment does not preserve \nthe right to a jury trial on factual questions \nconcerning exhaustion even when those fac-\ntual questions are intertwined with the un-\nderlying merits. \nAt common law, the Seventh Amendment did not \npreserve the right to a jury trial on equitable defenses \nsuch as exhaustion. Following the merger of the courts \nof law and equity in 1938, however, courts have recog-\nnized that \u201c[d]ifficulties may arise . . . when the legal \nand equitable issues overlap and the evidence is inter-\ntwined.\u201d Danjaq LLC v. Sony Corp., 263 F.3d 942, 962 \n(9th Cir. 2001); Ross v. Bernhard, 396 U.S. 531, 536\u2013\n39 (1970). This Court has held that, as a prudential \nmatter, where factual issues overlap between legal \nand equitable issues, jury-triable issues should \n\n38 \n \ngenerally be prioritized. See, e.g., Beacon Theatres, \n359 U.S. at 510\u201311; Dairy Queen, Inc. v. Wood, 369 \nU.S. 469, 472\u201373 (1962).  \nBut exhaustion remains a threshold precondition \nto suit that, by its nature, must be determined before \nthe merits. With that that order of operation in mind, \nthis Court has applied the Beacon Theatres principle \nonly where an equitable claim could, through collat-\neral estoppel or res judicata, bar a subsequent jury \ntrial on a legal claim. Exhaustion does not present \nsuch a circumstance. And, in any event, this Court has \nconsidered departure from the Beacon Theatres pru-\ndential rule when it would undercut congressional in-\ntent, as it would here. For these reasons, Richards \ndoes not have a jury trial right on factual questions \nconcerning exhaustion\u2014even when those questions \nare intertwined with the merits of his claims.  \nA. Beacon Theatres created a presumption \nthat juries should decide intertwined le-\ngal and equitable issues, but that pre-\nsumption does not apply here.  \nBeacon Theatres stands for the proposition that, \nwhere legal and equitable claims are grounded in the \nsame set of facts, the right to a jury trial on the legal \nclaims should prevail, precluding a prior determina-\ntion of the equitable claims. This \u201cgeneral prudential \nrule,\u201d Parklane Hosiery, 439 U.S. at 334, is primarily \nconcerned with the collateral estoppel or res judicata \neffect that an inverse ordering would present, id. See \nalso Katchen v. Landy, 382 U.S. 323, 339\u201340 (1966) \n(explaining that Beacon Theatres announced an \u201cequi-\ntable doctrine,\u201d not a bright-line rule). Consequently, \n\n39 \n \nall order-of-trial problems should, \u201cwherever possi-\nble,\u201d be resolved in favor of granting a jury trial to pre-\nserve the Seventh Amendment right. Beacon Thea-\ntres, 359 U.S. at 510. The resolution of an exhaustion \nquestion, however, does not present such a scenario.  \nBeacon Theatres involved a dispute between two \ntheatres regarding the validity of contracts in which \nthe film distributors had given one of the theatres, \nFox, the exclusive right to show \u201cfirst run pictures\u201d in \nthe area. Id. at 502. Because another theatre, Beacon, \n\u201cnotified Fox that it considered [the] contracts . . . to \nbe overt acts in violation of antitrust laws,\u201d id., Fox \nfiled suit seeking both declaratory judgment and an \ninjunction against Beacon asserting an antitrust \nclaim against it. Id. at 502\u201303. Beacon then filed a \ncounterclaim and cross-claim that the contracts vio-\nlated antitrust laws and requested treble damages. Id. \nat 503. Despite an issue of common fact among the \ncomplaint and counterclaim and Beacon\u2019s request for \na jury trial on legal issues, the district court ordered \nFox\u2019s claims, which were traditional suits in equity, to \nbe tried by the court before a determination of Bea-\ncon\u2019s claims. Id. at 503\u201304. The court of appeals af-\nfirmed, holding that the district judge could try the \nequitable claim first, even if it might preclude a jury \ntrial on the legal claims. Id. at 505.  \nThis Court disagreed. Reasoning that trying the \nequitable claims first could, by way of collateral estop-\npel or res judicata, bar a subsequent trial on the mer-\nits of Beacon\u2019s legal claims, the Court held that order-\nof-trial problems be resolved in favor of granting a \njury trial unless there are \u201cimperative circumstances, \ncircumstances which in view of the flexible procedures \n\n40 \n \nof the Federal Rules we cannot now anticipate.\u201d Id. at \n508; see id. at 504 (\u201c[I]f Beacon would have been enti-\ntled to a jury trial in a treble damage suit against Fox, \nit cannot be deprived of the right merely because Fox \ntook advantage of the availability of declaratory relief \nto sue Beacon first.\u201d); see also Parklane Hosiery, 439 \nU.S. at 333 (\u201cRecognition that an equitable determi-\nnation could have collateral-estoppel effect in a subse-\nquent legal action was the major premise of . . . Beacon \nTheatres.\u201d).  \nDairy Queen, decided three years later, involved \nsimilar timing concerns. There, the claims were both \nlegal (monetary damages for breach of contract) and \nequitable (relief in the form of injunction), and the dis-\ntrict court denied the defendants\u2019 demand for a jury \ntrial on the ground that the jury claim was only \u201cinci-\ndental\u201d to the non-jury claim. 369 U.S. at 470. This \nCourt, relying on Beacon Theatres, explained that \u201cthe \nright to trial by jury may [not] be lost as to legal issues \nwhere those are characterized as \u2018incidental\u2019 to equi-\ntable issues.\u201d Id. Again, the Court was concerned with \nthe preclusive effect that a determination on equitable \nissues would have on legal ones. Id. at 472\u201373. \nBeacon Theatres is therefore instructive in deter-\nmining the order of trial on merits-based arguments. \nWhere a party has a right to a jury trial on a legal \nclaim, the order of trial should be arranged to preserve \nthat right. This is consistent with \u201c[t]he limitation im-\nposed by the [Seventh] [A]mendment . . . that the ul-\ntimate determination of issues of fact by the jury be \nnot interfered with.\u201d In re Peterson, 253 U.S. at 310 \n(emphasis added); see also Markman, 517 U.S. at 377 \n(asking \u201cwhether a particular issue . . . is itself \n\n41 \n \nnecessarily a jury issue, the guarantee being essential \nto preserve the right to a jury\u2019s resolution of the ulti-\nmate dispute\u201d). \nExhaustion questions, whether intertwined with \nthe merits or not, do not raise the same concerns as \nthose in Beacon Theatres for two interrelated reasons. \nFirst, unlike the substantive claims in Beacon Thea-\ntres, exhaustion is a threshold precondition to reach-\ning the merits. Second, unlike the concerns of collat-\neral estoppel or res judicata in Beacon Theatres, a \njudge\u2019s factual findings on exhaustion would not pre-\nclude a jury\u2019s ability to consider those same facts when \ndetermining the merits of the legal claim.  \n1. The presumption does not apply be-\ncause exhaustion is a threshold issue \nthat is logically precedent to the mer-\nits.  \nBeacon Theatres involved competing causes of ac-\ntion\u2014claims for declaratory and injunctive relief on \nthe one hand and claims for treble damages on the \nother. Under the historical equity-first order of opera-\ntions, see Liberty Oil Co., 260 U.S. at 242, the latter \nmerits claims would have been bound by the determi-\nnation of the former and thus never tried before a jury. \nThis Court held that this would violate the Seventh \nAmendment.  \nNo such scenario is present here. Unlike the \nclaims at issue in Beacon Theatres, exhaustion is a \nthreshold precondition to suit that, by its nature, \nmust be determined before the merits. Given that it is \na rule of \u201corderly\u201d procedure, Sing Tuck, 194 U.S. at \n\n42 \n \n168, \u201c[u]ntil the issue of exhaustion is resolved, a \ncourt cannot know whether it is to decide the case or \nthe prison authorities are to,\u201d Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741. \nSee also Perez v. Wis. Dep\u2019t of Corr., 182 F.3d 532, 534 \n(7th Cir. 1999) (explaining that exhaustion is \u201cde-\nsigned to prevent [a] decision on the merits\u201d). To do \notherwise would flip exhaustion on its head\u2014defer-\nence to agency authority would be bypassed and judi-\ncial efficiency lost. See McCarthy, 503 U.S. at 145; Pe-\nrez, 182 F.3d at 534 (explaining that \u201c[e]xamining the \nmerits first and then ordering a case dismissed on ex-\nhaustion grounds . . . would disregard the statutory \napproach\u201d).  \nBecause exhaustion is a threshold issue, it does \nnot have any bearing on a prisoner\u2019s jury trial right. \nIndeed, \u201c \u2018[t]he Seventh Amendment does not confer \nthe right to a trial, but only the right to have a jury \nhear the case once it is determined that the litigation \nshould proceed before a court.\u2019 \u201d Caley, 428 F.3d at \n1372 (quoting Am. Heritage Life Ins. Co., 294 F.3d at \n711); see also Sydnor v. Conseco Fin. Serv. Corp., 252 \nF.3d 302, 307 (4th Cir. 2001) (same). In contrast to \nBeacon Theatres, in which there were competing equi-\ntable and legal causes of action, exhaustion presents \na threshold precondition to suit. Legal claims that are \nsubject to trial by jury may be tried by that jury only \nafter determination of the threshold issue. Beacon \nTheatres is therefore distinguishable and does not \ncompel a different result.  \n\n43 \n \n2. The presumption does not apply be-\ncause a judge\u2019s factual findings re-\ngarding exhaustion would not pre-\nclude a jury\u2019s consideration of the \nsame facts when determining the \nmerits of the legal claim.  \nThis case differs from Beacon Theatres for a sec-\nond reason. A jury can reexamine factual determina-\ntion made by a judge regarding exhaustion when de-\nciding the merits of the claim.  \nBoth Beacon Theatres and Dairy Queen involved \ncircumstances in which the right to a jury trial on a \nlegal issue would be lost through the determination of \nan equitable issue. And Beacon Theatres itself recog-\nnized that there would be cases in which a trial court \nhas \u201cdiscretion in deciding whether the legal or equi-\ntable cause should be tried first,\u201d 359 U.S. at 510, \nkeeping in mind that this discretion \u201cmust, wherever \npossible, be exercised to preserve jury trial.\u201d Id. See \nalso Markman, 517 U.S. at 377 (asking whether the \njury must hear this question to \u201cpreserve the \u2018sub-\nstance of the common-law right of trial by jury\u2019 \u201d) \n(quoting Tull, 481 U.S. at 426) (emphasis omitted). \nHere, that right can be preserved through a jury\u2019s \nability to reexamine the fact questions common to ex-\nhaustion and the underlying legal claim at trial. As \nexplained in Pavey:  \n[A]ny finding that the judge makes, relating \nto exhaustion, that might affect the merits \nmay be reexamined by the jury if\u2014and only \nafter\u2014the prisoner overcomes the exhaustion \ndefense and the case proceeds to the merits. \n544 F.3d at 742.  \n\n44 \n \nThis approach is consistent with the \u201cflexible\u201d na-\nture of collateral estoppel. Duvall v. Att\u2019y Gen. of the \nUnited States, 436 F.3d 382, 390 (3d Cir. 2006) \n(\u201cCourts and commentators have consistently recog-\nnized that collateral estoppel was borne of equity and \nis therefore \u2018flexible,\u2019 bending to satisfy its underlying \npurpose in light of the nature of the proceedings.\u201d) (ci-\ntation omitted); United States v. Stauffer Chem. Co., \n464 U.S. 165, 176 (1984) (White, J., concurring) (ex-\nplaining that collateral estoppel \u201cis a flexible, judge-\nmade doctrine\u201d). Cf. Parklane Hosiery, 439 U.S. at 331 \n(explaining that trial courts have \u201cbroad discretion\u201d in \ndetermining \nwhen \noffensive \ncollateral \nestoppel \n\u201cshould be applied\u201d). \nPavey\u2019s pragmatic approach disposes of the pri-\nmary concern at issue in Beacon Theatres and Dairy \nQueen\u2014namely, that the \u201cright to a jury trial of legal \nissues [would] be lost through prior determination of \nequitable claims.\u201d 359 U.S. at 511 (citation omitted). \nFollowing Pavey\u2019s approach, \u201c[i]f and when the judge \ndetermines that the prisoner has properly exhausted \nhis administrative remedies, the case will proceed to \npretrial discovery, and if necessary a trial, on the mer-\nits[.]\u201d 544 F.3d at 742; see also id. at 741 (explaining \nthat \u201cin many cases the only consequence of a failure \nto exhaust is that the prisoner must go back to the \nbottom rung of the administrative ladder\u201d).4 Then, \u201cif \nthere is a jury trial, the jury will make all necessary \nfindings of fact without being bound by (or even \n \n4 This approach also allays the concerns in Fireman\u2019s Fund, \nwhich the Sixth Circuit relied on below, that \u201cthe merits of a con-\ntroversy could be summarily decided\u201d \u201cwithout the ordinary inci-\ndents of trial.\u201d 253 F.2d at 784 (citing Smithers v. Smith, 204 \nU.S. 632, 645 (1907)).  \n\n45 \n \ninformed of) any of the findings made by the district \njudge in determining that the prisoner had exhausted \nhis administrative remedies.\u201d5 Id. In short, the \u201csub-\nstance of the common-law right of trial by jury\u201d is pre-\nserved. Colgrove, 413 U.S. at 156.  \nOf course, some prisoners will be unable to refile \ntheir lawsuit after a judge\u2019s determination that they \nfailed to properly exhaust administrative remedies. \nSee Pavey, 544 F.3d at 742 (explaining that where a \njudge decides that \u201cthe failure to exhaust was the pris-\noner\u2019s fault . . . the case is over\u201d). But this is simply a \nconsequence of the exhaustion requirement function-\ning as intended. See, e.g., Woodford, 548 U.S. at 89\u2013\n92 (discussing the purposes of exhaustion); id. at 95 \n(\u201cA prisoner who does not want to participate in the \nprison grievance system will have little incentive to \ncomply with the system\u2019s procedural rules unless non-\ncompliance carries a sanction.\u201d). And again, this con-\nsequence has no bearing on the Seventh Amendment, \nwhich guarantees a jury trial only after it is deter-\nmined that the case belongs in court.  \n \n5 As recognized in Pavey, the ability of a prisoner to refile a case \nafter proper exhaustion \u201cdistinguishes the issue of exhaustion \nfrom [other] deadline lines issues that juries decide.\u201d Id. at 741. \nFor example, \u201c[a] statute of limitations defense if successfully in-\nterposed ends the litigation rather than shunting it to another \nforum.\u201d Id.; see also Messa, 652 F.3d at 309\u201310 (explaining that \nthe doctrines of exhaustion and statutes of limitations \u201cplay . . . \nimportant\u2014and distinct\u2014roles in our system of justice\u201d) (cita-\ntion omitted).  \n\n46 \n \nB. Unlike in Beacon Theatres, a judicial de-\ntermination of exhaustion would imple-\nment congressional intent.  \nEven assuming Beacon Theatres applies generally \nto threshold issues that would not implicate the jury\u2019s \nultimate determination of the merits, its presumption \nshould not apply in the PLRA exhaustion context.  \nPost-Beacon Theatres, this Court has noted the \nlimitations of its order-of-trial presumption. In \nKatchen, for example, the Court explained that \u201c[b]oth \nBeacon Theatres and Dairy Queen recognize that \nthere might be situations in which the Courts could \nproceed to resolve the equitable claims first even \nthough the results might be dispositive of the issues \ninvolved in the legal claim.\u201d 382 U.S. at 339 (emphasis \nadded). The Katchen Court addressed \u201cthe mode of \nprocedure for trying out the issue\u201d of voidable prefer-\nences against an estate in bankruptcy proceedings. \n382 U.S. at 325, 326. Recognizing the equitable juris-\ndiction of bankruptcy courts and the \u201cspecific statu-\ntory scheme contemplating the prompt trial of a dis-\nputed claim but without the intervention of a jury,\u201d \nthis Court permitted a bankruptcy court to decide the \npreference issues in an equitable proceeding notwith-\nstanding the argument that it would \u201crender unneces-\nsary a trial in a [legal] action.\u201d Id. at 336, 339. The \nCourt rejected the petitioner\u2019s reliance on Beacon The-\natres and Dairy Queen, noting that the rule of those \ncases \u201cis itself an equitable doctrine\u201d and that appli-\ncation of the rule would \u201cdismember a scheme which \nCongress has prescribed.\u201d Id. at 339; see also id. at \n339\u201340 (\u201cBoth Beacon Theatres and Dairy Queen rec-\nognize that there might be situations in which the \nCourt could proceed to resolve the equitable claim \n\n47 \n \nfirst even though the results might be dispositive of \nthe issues involved in the legal claim.\u201d); but see Gran-\nfinanciera, 492 U.S. at 58\u201359 (noting the limitations \non the scope of Congress\u2019s ability to \u201cdivest [parties] of \ntheir Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial\u201d).  \nAs in Katchen, this case involves a specific statu-\ntory scheme whose purpose would be compromised ab-\nsent prompt resolution of disputed facts by the court. \nSee Katchen, 383 U.S. at 339. Congress passed the \nPLRA \u201cto reduce the quantity and improve the quality \nof prisoner suits.\u201d Porter, 534 U.S. at 524. The \u201cinvig-\norated\u201d exhaustion requirements is the \u201ccenterpiece\u201d \nof this legislation, Woodford, 548 U.S. at 84, and it \nserves dual purposes. It allows prisons to rectify their \nown mistakes before they are \u201chaled into federal \ncourt,\u201d id. at 89, and promotes judicial efficiency by \nreducing litigation and creating an administrative \nrecord for the litigation that does occur, id. \nAllowing potentially unexhausted claims to pro-\nceed to a jury trial subverts both purposes. See also \nPart I(B)(4). This subversion is further reason why the \nprudential rule set forth in Beacon Theatres should \nnot apply to PLRA exhaustion.  \nThat an exhaustion question is intertwined with \nthe merits of a prisoner\u2019s claim does not transform ex-\nhaustion into a jury-triable issue. Exhaustion is a \nthreshold issue that is logically precedent to the mer-\nits. And Beacon Theatres\u2019 presumption would not ap-\nply where any judicial determination of overlapping \nfacts remains subject to later review by a jury in a trial \non the merits. Finally, that a judicial determination of  \n \n \n\n48 \n \nexhaustion would implement congressional intent \nserves as yet another reason why Beacon Theatres\u2019 \nprudential rule should not apply to exhaustion ques-\ntions. \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be  \nreversed.  \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nAnn M.

It will detail the petitioner's interpretation of the PLRA, the Seventh Amendment, and relevant precedent. Understanding these arguments is absolutely essential to predicting how the Court will rule, as it constitutes one entire side of the legal dispute the Justices will be resolving. Without this, any analysis would be incomplete and speculative.\n\nDesign EIG is moderate (0.5) because this action reinforces a fundamental, best-practice step in any SCOTUS case analysis: reading the primary briefs. While not a novel or complex strategy, confirming the high value of this basic step is important for validating the overall design of the legal reasoning process. It solidifies the principle that analysis must begin with the parties' own arguments.\n\nThe joint EIG is high because the critical importance of this information for the specific task outweighs the fact that the strategy itself is a well-established one.",

This Court has held that judges can \ndecide facts related to threshold issues\u2014\nlike exhaustion\u2014without violating the \nSeventh Amendment. .................................. 16 \nB. The Seventh Amendment does not \npreserve the right to a jury trial on any \nfactual questions concerning exhaustion \nbecause exhaustion derives from equity. .... 19 \n\niii \n \n1. The Seventh Amendment guarantees \na jury trial right only as to issues \ntried by a jury in suits at common \nlaw at the time the Seventh \nAmendment was adopted. ..................... 20 \n2. Exhaustion did not exist at the \ncommon law, but closely analogous \nequitable issues were not decided by \njuries in 1791. ........................................ 22 \na. No historical antecedent to \nexhaustion existed at common \nlaw, but its origins are equitable \nin nature. ......................................... 23 \nb. Traditional equitable defenses \nsuch as adequate remedy at law, \nforum non conveniens, \nabstention, and habeas corpus \nbars are an appropriate common-\nlaw analog for exhaustion. .............. 27 \n3. Juries did not historically determine \nquestions of fact related to equitable \ndefenses analogous to exhaustion. ........ 33 \n4. Functional considerations \ndemonstrate that judges, not juries, \nshould determine exhaustion \nquestions. ............................................... 35 \nII. The Seventh Amendment does not preserve \nthe right to a jury trial on factual questions \nconcerning exhaustion even when those \nfactual questions are intertwined with the \nunderlying merits. .............................................. 37 \n\niv \n \nA. Beacon Theatres created a presumption \nthat juries should decide intertwined \nlegal and equitable issues, but that \npresumption does not apply here. ............... 38 \n1. The presumption does not apply \nbecause exhaustion is a threshold \nissue that is logically precedent to the \nmerits. .................................................... 41 \n2. The presumption does not apply \nbecause a judge\u2019s factual findings \nregarding exhaustion would not \npreclude a jury\u2019s consideration of the \nsame facts when determining the \nmerits of the legal claim. ....................... 43 \nB. Unlike in Beacon Theatres, a judicial \ndetermination of exhaustion would \nimplement congressional intent. ................. 46 \nConclusion ................................................................. 48 \n \n\nv \n \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES \nPage \nCases \nAlbino v.

This Court has ju-\nrisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \n \n \n\n2 \n \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe Seventh Amendment to the United States \nConstitution, U.S. Const. amend. VII, provides: \nIn suits at common law, where the value in \ncontroversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the \nright of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no \nfact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-ex-\namined in any Court of the United States, \nthan according to the rules of the common law. \nThe Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a), states in applicable part: \n(a) No action shall be brought with respect to \nprison conditions under section 1983 of this ti-\ntle, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner \nconfined in any jail, prison, or other correc-\ntional facility until such administrative reme-\ndies as are available are exhausted. \nINTRODUCTION \nThe importance of the Seventh Amendment right \nto a trial by jury is well recognized. Less clear, but \nequally important, is the central principle that under-\ngirds the right: preservation of the right to a jury\u2019s ul-\ntimate determination of issues of fact where a case \nproceeds to trial. Embedded in that principle is a tacit \nlimitation\u2014the Seventh Amendment does not guar-\nantee the right to a jury trial on every fact question \nwithin a jury-triable case. Rather, the right is impli-\ncated only when a particular issue or trial decision \nmust fall to the jury to maintain the substance of the \n\n3 \n \ncommon-law right as it existed in 1791. This limita-\ntion is consistent with this Court\u2019s jurisprudence\u2014\nboth its historical view of the Seventh Amendment \nand its treatment of cases involving an overlap of legal \nand equitable issues that implicate collateral estoppel \nconcerns as opposed to cases where those concerns are \nnot present.  \nThe issue of exhaustion under the PLRA is not one \nfor a jury. Exhaustion has no precise historical analog, \nand the closest analogs are forum-based equitable de-\nfenses, which were historically decided by judges, not \nby juries.  \nThis understanding endures even where the facts \nunderlying the question of exhaustion are intertwined \nwith the merits of a prisoner\u2019s claim. In this circum-\nstance, a judge\u2019s determination as to exhaustion does \nnot impinge on the \u201csubstance\u201d of the jury trial right\u2014\nthat right remains preserved. Where the prisoner has \nproperly exhausted administrative remedies, a jury \nmay then be impaneled to find the facts concerning \nthe underlying claims and will not be bound by the \njudge\u2019s earlier factual determinations. This division of \nduties is consistent with a judge\u2019s gatekeeping role, \ncomports with the goals of the PLRA, and protects the \nright to trial by jury. \n \n \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. The PLRA Framework \nIn 1970, just over 2,000 prisoner civil rights suits \nwere filed in federal courts. Margo Schlanger, Trends \nin Prisoner Litigation, as the PLRA Approaches 20, 28 \nCorr. L. Reporter, 69, 71 (2017). Shortly after that, fil-\nings exploded. Id.  \nIn 1980, Congress took a first stab at an exhaus-\ntion provision for prisoner suits filed under \u00a7 1983. \nUnder the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons \nAct, 94 Stat. 352, as amended, district courts could \nstay a prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 1983 suit for up to 180 days while \nthe prisoner pursued \u201cplain, speedy, and effective ad-\nministrative remedies.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a)(1) (for-\nmer). The exhaustion requirement was discretionary \nthough\u2014exhaustion could be required only if the \nstate\u2019s prison grievance system met federal standards \nand if exhaustion was \u201cappropriate and in the inter-\nests of justice.\u201d \u00a7 1997e(a)(1), (2). \nBut that exhaustion provision did not stem the \ntide of prisoner litigation. By the mid-1990s, correc-\ntional systems and federal courts were overburdened \nby a mammoth caseload of prisoner litigation. In 1995 \nalone, 39,053 prisoner lawsuits were filed in federal \ncourt, a rate of 24.6 per 1,000 prisoners. Schlanger, \nTrends in Prisoner Litigation, supra, at 71. Not sur-\nprisingly, this strained the resources of the federal \ncourt system, not to mention correctional systems.  \nIn 1996, Congress enacted the PLRA \u201cin the wake \nof a sharp rise in prisoner litigation in the federal \ncourts.\u201d Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 84 (2006) \n\n5 \n \n(citing Alexander v. Hawk, 159 F.3d 1321, 1324\u201325 \n(11th Cir. 1998) (citing statistics)). A significant com-\nponent of the PLRA was a robust, mandatory exhaus-\ntion requirement. Congress \u201cinvigorated the exhaus-\ntion prescription\u201d that had existed under the prior re-\ngime, now requiring prisoners to fully exhaust all of \ntheir available administrative remedies through the \ngrievance process as a prerequisite to filing suit in fed-\neral court. Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 524 (2002).  \nAs stated by this Court, \u201cBeyond doubt, Congress \nenacted \u00a7 1997e(a) to reduce the quantity and improve \nthe quality of prisoner suits.\u201d Id. at 524. To further \nthis end, \u201cCongress afforded corrections officials time \nand opportunity to address complaints internally\u201d \nprior to prisoners seeking relief in federal court. Id. at \n525. By giving correctional officials the opportunity to \naddress grievances, \u201ccorrective action taken in re-\nsponse to an inmate\u2019s grievance might improve prison \nadministration and satisfy the inmate, thereby obvi-\nating the need for litigation.\u201d Id. (citing Booth v. \nChurner, 532 U.S. 731, 737 (2001)). In addition, a \nprison\u2019s \u201cinternal review might \u2018filter out some frivo-\nlous claims.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting Booth, 532 U.S. at 737). \nAnd the administrative record created by the prisons\u2019 \ninternal grievance processes would facilitate consider-\nation of those \u201ccases ultimately brought to court.\u201d Id. \n(citations omitted).  \nThe PLRA has been tremendously successful in \nreducing the burden on both prison officials and fed-\neral courts. From the peak of filings in 1995, within \nfive years of the passage of the PLRA prisoner law-\nsuits had fallen by 43%, even though the total prisoner \npopulation grew by 23%. Margo Schlanger, Inmate \n\n6 \n \nLitigation, 116 Harv. L. Rev. 1555, 1694 (2003). This \ndecline continued for several more years. By 2006, the \ndecline reached 60%. Margo Schlanger & Giovanna \nShay, Preserving the Rule of Law in America\u2019s Jails \nand Prisons: The Case for Amending the Prison Liti-\ngation Reform Act, 11 U. Pa. J. Const. L. 139, 141\u201342 \n(2008). Although the decline gradually plateaued, by \n2014, prisoners filed 25,324 lawsuits, a rate of 11.6 per \n1,000 prisoners. Schlanger, Trends in Prisoner Litiga-\ntion, supra, at 71. Compared to 1995, this represents \na 34% decrease in the number of prisoner lawsuits and \na 53% decline in the rate of lawsuits filed per 1,000 \nprisoners. See id. The exhaustion requirement has \nbeen a critical component of the PLRA\u2019s success.  \nB. MDOC\u2019s grievance process \nThe Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC) \nhas two separate processes for grievances. One is the \nstandard grievance procedure, governed by MDOC \nPolicy Directive 03.02.130, which is not applicable \nhere. J.A. 41\u201361. The other is the administrative pro-\ncess under the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA), \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 15601, et seq., and the Prohibited Sexual \nConduct Involving Prisoners policy (effective date \n04/24/2017), governed by MDOC Policy Directive \n03.03.140. J.A. 62\u201387.  \nThe PREA grievance procedure applies to Rich-\nards\u2019 claims of sexual abuse, harassment, and miscon-\nduct. MDOC uses a two-step process for PREA griev-\nances, both of which must be exhausted. J.A. 74\u201375. \nMDOC will not facially reject or deny grievances al-\nleging sexual abuse. J.A. 74\u201375. Instead, such \n\n7 \n \ngrievances must be investigated. J.A. 76. \u201cA prisoner \nmay file a PREA grievance at any time.\u201d J.A. 75.  \nA prisoner initiates the first step of the process by \nfiling a PREA Prisoner Grievance Form (Step I). \nJ.A. 75. Prisoners may grieve retaliation for reporting \nsexual abuse, harassment, or misconduct through the \nPREA grievance process. J.A. 72\u201373. PREA griev-\nances may not be referred to MDOC staff who are the \nsubject of the grievance. J.A. 76.  \nAt Step I, the PREA Coordinator1 must ensure \nthat \u201ca written response is provided to the prisoner \nwithin 60 calendar days of receipt of the Step I PREA \nGrievance,\u201d although an extension of up to 70 calen-\ndar days may be requested. J.A. 76\u201377. Prisoners \nmust be notified in writing of any extensions and the \ndue date for a response. J.A. 76\u201377.  \nPrisoners may appeal a Step I decision to Step II \nif they are unsatisfied with the response or the re-\nsponse was not timely. J.A. 77. MDOC\u2019s response to a \nStep II appeal is due within 90 calendar days of re-\nceipt, absent an extension, and it constitutes the final \ndecision in the matter. J.A. 77.  \nC. District Court Proceedings and Eviden-\ntiary Hearing \nRichards and co-Plaintiffs Kenneth Damon Pruitt \nand Robert Kissee filed suit under \u00a7 1983, alleging \nthat Perttu, a Resident Unit Manager (RUM) for the \nMDOC, sexually harassed them and other prisoners, \n \n1 Every prison has a PREA Coordinator designated by the war-\nden. J.A. 67.  \n\n8 \n \nretaliated against them, and destroyed their property, \nin violation of the First, Fifth, and Eighth Amend-\nments. J.A. 1\u201338. Perttu moved for summary judg-\nment, asserting that Richards and his co-Plaintiffs \nfailed to exhaust administrative remedies before filing \ntheir complaint. Pet. App. 3a. Richards and his co-\nPlaintiffs alleged that Perttu had destroyed their \ngrievances or otherwise prevented them from being \nprocessed, making the grievance process unavailable. \nPet. App. 30a, 37a, 59a\u201360a. \nThe district court denied Perttu\u2019s motion, finding \nthat there was a question of fact as to whether the \ngrievance process was available to Richards due to his \nallegation that Perttu interfered with his grievance \nfilings. Pet. App. 79a\u201381a, 83a.  \nFollowing this ruling, the magistrate judge con-\nducted an evidentiary hearing on the issue of exhaus-\ntion. J.A. 88\u2013368. Evaluating the testimony, evidence, \nand arguments presented, the magistrate judge rec-\nommended that the district court conclude that Perttu \ncarried his burden of establishing \u201cthat Plaintiffs \nfailed to exhaust any of their claims before filing suit,\u201d \nPet. App. 64a, 76a, and that the \u201cadministrative rem-\nedies were generally available\u201d to Richards and his co-\nPlaintiffs. Pet. App. 68a.  \nIn reaching that conclusion, the magistrate judge \nfound that Richards\u2019 direct examinations, which re-\nlied on leading questions, undermined the credibility \nof his witnesses. Pet. App. 69a. The magistrate judge \nthen discussed how the circumstances surrounding \nthe alleged observations of Perttu destroying griev-\nances similarly undermined Plaintiffs\u2019 credibility. Pet. \nApp. 71a\u201373a. Notably, the evidence \u201cdemonstrate[d] \n\n9 \n \nthat RUM Perttu could not, and in fact did not, inter-\ncept and destroy all grievances filed by Plaintiffs in \nthe relevant time\u201d: \n[E]ven on the dates that RUM Perttu worked, \nhe testified that he only works from 7:00am to \n3:30pm. Moreover, RUM Perttu did not work \nseven days a week every week from June 2019 \nto March 2020. Indeed, on at least one of the \ndates on which Richards alleges Perttu de-\nstroyed his grievances, January 1, 2020, \nPerttu testified that he was not working due \nto the New Years holiday. \nPet. App. 73a\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

This Court has held that judges can \ndecide facts related to threshold issues\u2014\nlike exhaustion\u2014without violating the \nSeventh Amendment. .................................. 16 \nB. The Seventh Amendment does not \npreserve the right to a jury trial on any \nfactual questions concerning exhaustion \nbecause exhaustion derives from equity. .... 19 \n\niii \n \n1. The Seventh Amendment guarantees \na jury trial right only as to issues \ntried by a jury in suits at common \nlaw at the time the Seventh \nAmendment was adopted. ..................... 20 \n2. Exhaustion did not exist at the \ncommon law, but closely analogous \nequitable issues were not decided by \njuries in 1791. ........................................ 22 \na. No historical antecedent to \nexhaustion existed at common \nlaw, but its origins are equitable \nin nature. ......................................... 23 \nb. Traditional equitable defenses \nsuch as adequate remedy at law, \nforum non conveniens, \nabstention, and habeas corpus \nbars are an appropriate common-\nlaw analog for exhaustion. .............. 27 \n3.

The \nopinion of the United States District Court for the \nWestern District of Michigan (Pet. App. 22a\u201328a) is \nnot reported but is available at 2022 WL 842654. \nJURISDICTION \nThe district court had jurisdiction over claims \nbrought by Respondent Kyle Brandon Richards under \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. The district \ncourt entered judgment for Petitioner Thomas Perttu \non March 22, 2022. Richards filed a timely notice of \nappeal by right on April 11, 2022. The court of appeals \nhad jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s final \njudgment under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. This Court has ju-\nrisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \n \n \n\n2 \n \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe Seventh Amendment to the United States \nConstitution, U.S. Const. amend. VII, provides: \nIn suits at common law, where the value in \ncontroversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the \nright of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no \nfact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-ex-\namined in any Court of the United States, \nthan according to the rules of the common law. \nThe Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a), states in applicable part: \n(a) No action shall be brought with respect to \nprison conditions under section 1983 of this ti-\ntle, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner \nconfined in any jail, prison, or other correc-\ntional facility until such administrative reme-\ndies as are available are exhausted. \nINTRODUCTION \nThe importance of the Seventh Amendment right \nto a trial by jury is well recognized. Less clear, but \nequally important, is the central principle that under-\ngirds the right: preservation of the right to a jury\u2019s ul-\ntimate determination of issues of fact where a case \nproceeds to trial. Embedded in that principle is a tacit \nlimitation\u2014the Seventh Amendment does not guar-\nantee the right to a jury trial on every fact question \nwithin a jury-triable case. Rather, the right is impli-\ncated only when a particular issue or trial decision \nmust fall to the jury to maintain the substance of the \n\n3 \n \ncommon-law right as it existed in 1791. This limita-\ntion is consistent with this Court\u2019s jurisprudence\u2014\nboth its historical view of the Seventh Amendment \nand its treatment of cases involving an overlap of legal \nand equitable issues that implicate collateral estoppel \nconcerns as opposed to cases where those concerns are \nnot present.  \nThe issue of exhaustion under the PLRA is not one \nfor a jury. Exhaustion has no precise historical analog, \nand the closest analogs are forum-based equitable de-\nfenses, which were historically decided by judges, not \nby juries.  \nThis understanding endures even where the facts \nunderlying the question of exhaustion are intertwined \nwith the merits of a prisoner\u2019s claim. In this circum-\nstance, a judge\u2019s determination as to exhaustion does \nnot impinge on the \u201csubstance\u201d of the jury trial right\u2014\nthat right remains preserved. Where the prisoner has \nproperly exhausted administrative remedies, a jury \nmay then be impaneled to find the facts concerning \nthe underlying claims and will not be bound by the \njudge\u2019s earlier factual determinations. This division of \nduties is consistent with a judge\u2019s gatekeeping role, \ncomports with the goals of the PLRA, and protects the \nright to trial by jury. \n \n \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. The PLRA Framework \nIn 1970, just over 2,000 prisoner civil rights suits \nwere filed in federal courts. Margo Schlanger, Trends \nin Prisoner Litigation, as the PLRA Approaches 20, 28 \nCorr. L. Reporter, 69, 71 (2017). Shortly after that, fil-\nings exploded. Id.  \nIn 1980, Congress took a first stab at an exhaus-\ntion provision for prisoner suits filed under \u00a7 1983. \nUnder the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons \nAct, 94 Stat. 352, as amended, district courts could \nstay a prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 1983 suit for up to 180 days while \nthe prisoner pursued \u201cplain, speedy, and effective ad-\nministrative remedies.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a)(1) (for-\nmer). The exhaustion requirement was discretionary \nthough\u2014exhaustion could be required only if the \nstate\u2019s prison grievance system met federal standards \nand if exhaustion was \u201cappropriate and in the inter-\nests of justice.\u201d \u00a7 1997e(a)(1), (2). \nBut that exhaustion provision did not stem the \ntide of prisoner litigation. By the mid-1990s, correc-\ntional systems and federal courts were overburdened \nby a mammoth caseload of prisoner litigation. In 1995 \nalone, 39,053 prisoner lawsuits were filed in federal \ncourt, a rate of 24.6 per 1,000 prisoners. Schlanger, \nTrends in Prisoner Litigation, supra, at 71. Not sur-\nprisingly, this strained the resources of the federal \ncourt system, not to mention correctional systems.  \nIn 1996, Congress enacted the PLRA \u201cin the wake \nof a sharp rise in prisoner litigation in the federal \ncourts.\u201d Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 84 (2006) \n\n5 \n \n(citing Alexander v. Hawk, 159 F.3d 1321, 1324\u201325 \n(11th Cir. 1998) (citing statistics)). A significant com-\nponent of the PLRA was a robust, mandatory exhaus-\ntion requirement. Congress \u201cinvigorated the exhaus-\ntion prescription\u201d that had existed under the prior re-\ngime, now requiring prisoners to fully exhaust all of \ntheir available administrative remedies through the \ngrievance process as a prerequisite to filing suit in fed-\neral court. Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 524 (2002).  \nAs stated by this Court, \u201cBeyond doubt, Congress \nenacted \u00a7 1997e(a) to reduce the quantity and improve \nthe quality of prisoner suits.\u201d Id. at 524. To further \nthis end, \u201cCongress afforded corrections officials time \nand opportunity to address complaints internally\u201d \nprior to prisoners seeking relief in federal court. Id. at \n525. By giving correctional officials the opportunity to \naddress grievances, \u201ccorrective action taken in re-\nsponse to an inmate\u2019s grievance might improve prison \nadministration and satisfy the inmate, thereby obvi-\nating the need for litigation.\u201d Id. (citing Booth v. \nChurner, 532 U.S. 731, 737 (2001)). In addition, a \nprison\u2019s \u201cinternal review might \u2018filter out some frivo-\nlous claims.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting Booth, 532 U.S. at 737). \nAnd the administrative record created by the prisons\u2019 \ninternal grievance processes would facilitate consider-\nation of those \u201ccases ultimately brought to court.\u201d Id. \n(citations omitted).  \nThe PLRA has been tremendously successful in \nreducing the burden on both prison officials and fed-\neral courts. From the peak of filings in 1995, within \nfive years of the passage of the PLRA prisoner law-\nsuits had fallen by 43%, even though the total prisoner \npopulation grew by 23%. Margo Schlanger, Inmate \n\n6 \n \nLitigation, 116 Harv. L. Rev. 1555, 1694 (2003). This \ndecline continued for several more years. By 2006, the \ndecline reached 60%. Margo Schlanger & Giovanna \nShay, Preserving the Rule of Law in America\u2019s Jails \nand Prisons: The Case for Amending the Prison Liti-\ngation Reform Act, 11 U. Pa. J. Const. L. 139, 141\u201342 \n(2008). Although the decline gradually plateaued, by \n2014, prisoners filed 25,324 lawsuits, a rate of 11.6 per \n1,000 prisoners. Schlanger, Trends in Prisoner Litiga-\ntion, supra, at 71. Compared to 1995, this represents \na 34% decrease in the number of prisoner lawsuits and \na 53% decline in the rate of lawsuits filed per 1,000 \nprisoners. See id. The exhaustion requirement has \nbeen a critical component of the PLRA\u2019s success.  \nB. MDOC\u2019s grievance process \nThe Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC) \nhas two separate processes for grievances. One is the \nstandard grievance procedure, governed by MDOC \nPolicy Directive 03.02.130, which is not applicable \nhere. J.A. 41\u201361. The other is the administrative pro-\ncess under the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA), \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 15601, et seq., and the Prohibited Sexual \nConduct Involving Prisoners policy (effective date \n04/24/2017), governed by MDOC Policy Directive \n03.03.140. J.A. 62\u201387.  \nThe PREA grievance procedure applies to Rich-\nards\u2019 claims of sexual abuse, harassment, and miscon-\nduct. MDOC uses a two-step process for PREA griev-\nances, both of which must be exhausted. J.A. 74\u201375. \nMDOC will not facially reject or deny grievances al-\nleging sexual abuse. J.A. 74\u201375. Instead, such \n\n7 \n \ngrievances must be investigated. J.A. 76. \u201cA prisoner \nmay file a PREA grievance at any time.\u201d J.A. 75.  \nA prisoner initiates the first step of the process by \nfiling a PREA Prisoner Grievance Form (Step I). \nJ.A. 75. Prisoners may grieve retaliation for reporting \nsexual abuse, harassment, or misconduct through the \nPREA grievance process. J.A. 72\u201373. PREA griev-\nances may not be referred to MDOC staff who are the \nsubject of the grievance. J.A. 76.  \nAt Step I, the PREA Coordinator1 must ensure \nthat \u201ca written response is provided to the prisoner \nwithin 60 calendar days of receipt of the Step I PREA \nGrievance,\u201d although an extension of up to 70 calen-\ndar days may be requested. J.A. 76\u201377. Prisoners \nmust be notified in writing of any extensions and the \ndue date for a response. J.A. 76\u201377.  \nPrisoners may appeal a Step I decision to Step II \nif they are unsatisfied with the response or the re-\nsponse was not timely. J.A. 77. MDOC\u2019s response to a \nStep II appeal is due within 90 calendar days of re-\nceipt, absent an extension, and it constitutes the final \ndecision in the matter. J.A. 77.  \nC. District Court Proceedings and Eviden-\ntiary Hearing \nRichards and co-Plaintiffs Kenneth Damon Pruitt \nand Robert Kissee filed suit under \u00a7 1983, alleging \nthat Perttu, a Resident Unit Manager (RUM) for the \nMDOC, sexually harassed them and other prisoners, \n \n1 Every prison has a PREA Coordinator designated by the war-\nden. J.A. 67.  \n\n8 \n \nretaliated against them, and destroyed their property, \nin violation of the First, Fifth, and Eighth Amend-\nments. J.A. 1\u201338. Perttu moved for summary judg-\nment, asserting that Richards and his co-Plaintiffs \nfailed to exhaust administrative remedies before filing \ntheir complaint. Pet. App. 3a. Richards and his co-\nPlaintiffs alleged that Perttu had destroyed their \ngrievances or otherwise prevented them from being \nprocessed, making the grievance process unavailable. \nPet. App. 30a, 37a, 59a\u201360a. \nThe district court denied Perttu\u2019s motion, finding \nthat there was a question of fact as to whether the \ngrievance process was available to Richards due to his \nallegation that Perttu interfered with his grievance \nfilings. Pet. App. 79a\u201381a, 83a.  \nFollowing this ruling, the magistrate judge con-\nducted an evidentiary hearing on the issue of exhaus-\ntion. J.A. 88\u2013368. Evaluating the testimony, evidence, \nand arguments presented, the magistrate judge rec-\nommended that the district court conclude that Perttu \ncarried his burden of establishing \u201cthat Plaintiffs \nfailed to exhaust any of their claims before filing suit,\u201d \nPet. App. 64a, 76a, and that the \u201cadministrative rem-\nedies were generally available\u201d to Richards and his co-\nPlaintiffs. Pet. App. 68a.  \nIn reaching that conclusion, the magistrate judge \nfound that Richards\u2019 direct examinations, which re-\nlied on leading questions, undermined the credibility \nof his witnesses. Pet. App. 69a. The magistrate judge \nthen discussed how the circumstances surrounding \nthe alleged observations of Perttu destroying griev-\nances similarly undermined Plaintiffs\u2019 credibility. Pet. \nApp. 71a\u201373a. Notably, the evidence \u201cdemonstrate[d] \n\n9 \n \nthat RUM Perttu could not, and in fact did not, inter-\ncept and destroy all grievances filed by Plaintiffs in \nthe relevant time\u201d: \n[E]ven on the dates that RUM Perttu worked, \nhe testified that he only works from 7:00am to \n3:30pm. Moreover, RUM Perttu did not work \nseven days a week every week from June 2019 \nto March 2020. Indeed, on at least one of the \ndates on which Richards alleges Perttu de-\nstroyed his grievances, January 1, 2020, \nPerttu testified that he was not working due \nto the New Years holiday. \nPet. App. 73a. \nMoreover, the evidence showed that Richards had \naccess to the grievance process: \nBut even had Perttu been working every hour \nof every day . . . Richards actually took ad-\nvantage of the grievance procedure by filing \nStep I grievance forms twenty-six times be-\ntween June 6, 2019, and April 23, 2020.  \n* * * \nMoreover, of Richards\u2019s six Step I grievance \nforms entered into evidence, three specifically \ngrieved RUM Perttu, undermining any allega-\ntion that Perttu sorted through the grievances \nand discarded those directed towards him.  \nPet. App. 73a\u201374a.  \n\n10 \n \nThe magistrate judge noted that \u201cRichards\u2019s suc-\ncessful use of the grievance procedure . . . directly con-\ntradicts Plaintiffs\u2019 claim that administrative remedies \nwere effectively unavailable, and Plaintiffs\u2019 failure \n[to] use any of the alternative reporting methods . . . \ncasts doubt on their alleged attempts to file PREA \ngrievances.\u201d Pet. App. 75a.  \nThe magistrate judge found that \u201cPlaintiffs pro-\nvided no evidence that RUM Perttu\u201d influenced the \ncorrections officers he supervised to destroy or not \nprocess their grievances. Pet. App. 75a. Indeed, \u201cthe \ncredibility of Plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses was undermined by \ntheir inability to independently recollect the time or \nlocation of RUM Perttu\u2019s alleged destruction of Plain-\ntiff\u2019s grievances, as well as the unlikely circumstances \nunder which they claimed they observed such destruc-\ntion.\u201d Pet. App. 75a\u201376a. For instance, as a matter of \n\u201ccommon sense,\u201d Perttu could not have been \u201cpresent \nto intercept every grievance\u201d filed by Plaintiffs. Pet. \nApp. 76a. Based on these findings, the magistrate \njudge recommended that the district court conclude \nthat Richards and his co-Plaintiffs failed to exhaust \ntheir claims against Perttu and dismiss their claims \nwithout prejudice. Pet. App. 76a.  \nRichards and his co-Plaintiffs filed nine objec-\ntions, which the district court overruled. Pet. App. \n22a\u201328a. The district court adopted the report and \nrecommendation and entered judgment for Perttu. \nPet. App. 29a. Richards alone appealed the district \ncourt\u2019s ruling.  \n\n11 \n \nD. Sixth Circuit Proceedings \nOn appeal, Richards argued that the district court \nerred by not granting him a jury trial to resolve the \nexhaustion issue, which he claimed was intertwined \nwith the merits of his case.  \nThe Sixth Circuit began its analysis by discussing \nwhether the exhaustion issue was intertwined with \nRichards\u2019 underlying retaliation claim, noting that \nRichards alleged that Perttu destroyed his grievances, \npreventing him from exhausting the grievance re-\nquirements. Richards\u2019 complaint, the Sixth Circuit \nsaid, \u201clays out several specific instances when Perttu \nallegedly destroyed grievances that Richards had in-\ntended to file.\u201d Pet. App. 2a\u20133a. This allegedly \u201cinter-\nfered with Richards\u2019s speech.\u201d Pet. App. 10a. Under \nthese circumstances, the court concluded that \u201cthe \nfactual disputes regarding exhaustion . . . are inter-\ntwined with the merits of Richards\u2019s retaliation \nclaim.\u201d Pet. App. 12a. \nThe Sixth Circuit turned its attention to whether \nthis intertwining implicated the Seventh Amendment \nright to a jury trial. The court recognized that, in Lee \nv. Willey, 789 F.3d 673 (6th Cir. 2015), it held that the \nprisoner had no right to a jury trial for an exhaustion \ndefense under the PLRA. Pet. App. 13a. But the court \nnoted that Lee did not govern the present case because \nthe disputed facts of the exhaustion issue were not \n\u201c \u2018bound up with the merits of the underlying dis-\npute.\u2019 \u201d Pet. App. 13a (quoting Lee, 789 F.3d at 678).  \nThe Sixth Circuit then looked to the other circuits, \nnoting that only the Seventh Circuit had squarely ad-\ndressed the issue, in Pavey v. Conley, 544 F.3d 739 \n\n12 \n \n(7th Cir. 2008). There, the Seventh Circuit held that \nprisoners had no right to a jury trial to determine \nwhether they had exhausted their administrative \nremedies under the PLRA, regardless of whether the \nexhaustion issue is intertwined with the merits of the \ncase. Pet. App. 14a (citing Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741\u201342). \nAccording to the Seventh Circuit, \u201c[j]uries decide \ncases, not issues of judicial traffic control.\u201d Pavey, 544 \nF.3d at 741. The Ninth Circuit agreed with the rea-\nsoning of Pavey in Albino v. Baca, 747 F.3d 1162, 1171 \n(9th Cir. 2014) (en banc) (citations omitted). Pet. App. \n14a. \nInstead of following the reasoning of the Seventh \nand Ninth Circuits, the Sixth Circuit found \u201cseveral \ndistrict-court decisions in the Second Circuit\u201d more \nconvincing. Pet. App. 15a\u201317a. It ultimately con-\ncluded that \u201cRichards was stripped of his right to a \njury\u2019s resolution of the ultimate dispute\u201d because he \nwas denied a jury trial on the exhaustion issue. Pet. \nApp. 17a (internal citation omitted). The Sixth Circuit \nalso relied on Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Co. v. Rail-\nway Express Agency, Inc., 253 F.2d 780, 784 (6th Cir. \n1958). Pet. App. 17a\u201319a. In Fireman\u2019s Fund, the \nSixth Circuit had held that when jurisdiction is inter-\ntwined with the merits of the case, the issue cannot be \nsummarily decided where factual claims would not be \nsubject to cross-examination. 253 F.2d at 784 (\u201cthe \nmerits of a controversy could be summarily decided, \npartly on affidavits without the right of cross-exami-\nnation\u201d) (citation omitted). \nThe Sixth Circuit held that the district court erred \nby ordering an evidentiary hearing rather than a jury \ntrial on the issue of exhaustion, \u201cemphasiz[ing] that a \n\n13 \n \njury trial is appropriate in these circumstances only if \nthe district court finds that genuine disputes of mate-\nrial fact concerning PLRA exhaustion are \u2018decisive of \nthe merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claim.\u2019 \u201d Pet. App. 19a \n(quoting Fireman\u2019s Fund, 253 F.2d at 784). \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe PLRA mandates that prisoners exhaust ad-\nministrative remedies before filing a lawsuit in fed-\neral court. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). Despite this precon-\ndition to suit, the Sixth Circuit held that prisoners are \nentitled to a jury trial when exhaustion disputes are \nintertwined with the merits of their claims. This con-\nclusion is not grounded in the Seventh Amendment. \n1. The Seventh Amendment permits courts to re-\nsolve disputed facts bearing on whether prisoners \nhave exhausted their claims. The Amendment pre-\nserves the right to a jury trial as it existed under the \nEnglish common law in 1791. Consistent with the \nAmendment\u2019s language, this Court has adhered to a \n\u201chistorical test,\u201d which asks two questions: (1) \nwhether the cause of action at issue \u201ceither was tried \nat law at the time of the founding or is at least analo-\ngous to one that was,\u201d Markman v. Westview Instru-\nments, Inc., 517 U.S. 370, 376 (1996) (citation omit-\nted), and (2) \u201c[i]f the action in question belongs in the \nlaw category, . . . whether the particular [issue] . . . \nmust fall to the jury in order to preserve the substance \nof the common-law right as it existed in 1791,\u201d id.  \nThis case turns on the second question, which, as \nthis Court has emphasized, \u201cmust depend on whether \nthe jury must shoulder this responsibility as neces-\nsary to preserve the \u2018substance of the common-law \n\n14 \n \nright of trial by jury.\u2019 \u201d Tull v. United States, 481 U.S. \n412, 426 (1987) (quoting Colgrove v. Battin, 413 U.S. \n149, 157 (1973)). The Court answers this question \nmuch like its first\u2014by using a historical method, and \n\u201c[w]here there is no exact antecedent,\u201d by \u201ccomparing \nthe modern practice to earlier ones whose allocation \nto court or jury we do know.\u201d Markman, 517 U.S. at \n378 (citations omitted).  \nExhaustion did not exist in 1791, and it was not \nuntil the twentieth century that courts fully articu-\nlated the doctrine. Thus, there is no exact antecedent \nto look to for answers. But exhaustion\u2019s roots in courts \nof equity provide helpful guidance. Exhaustion was \napplied by those courts to promote an orderly proce-\ndure whereby an administrative forum was the appro-\npriate starting point for a dispute. Other forum-based \nequitable defenses\u2014such as the adequate remedy at \nlaw doctrine, forum non conveniens, abstention, and \nhabeas corpus bars\u2014therefore provide a suitable his-\ntorical analog.  \nAt common law, these defenses were not afforded \na jury trial right. This was true regardless of whether \nthose defenses were interposed in courts of law, in \nwhich case a court of equity would first dispose of the \nissue. Only where an issue at law remained would \nthat issue be jury-triable. Because these equitable de-\nfenses were not subject to a jury determination at \ncommon law, neither should exhaustion.  \nEven if these historical analogs are insufficient, \nfunctional considerations should guide this Court\u2019s \ndecision. In this regard, the PLRA\u2019s goals\u2014\u201cto reduce \nthe quantity and improve the quality of prisoner \nsuits,\u201d \nPorter, \n534 \nU.S. \nat \n524\u2014would \nbe \n\n15 \n \ncompromised, if not outright defeated, by a jury trial \non exhaustion. The PLRA allows prison officials the \nopportunity to address prisoner complaints prior to \nfederal-court interference. This, in turn, obviates the \nneed for some prisoner lawsuits and creates an admin-\nistrative record for those that are filed.  \nJudges also frequently decide threshold issues \nand are thus better positioned than juries to decide \nexhaustion questions. And due to the significant num-\nber of prisoner cases judges see, they are particularly \nwell-equipped to deal with questions about a prison\u2019s \ninternal operations. Consequently, an exhaustion \nquestion should be allocated to the judge, not a jury.  \n2. That a question of exhaustion is intertwined \nwith the merits of a prisoner\u2019s claim does not change \nthis outcome. While Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, \n359 U.S. 500 (1959), establishes a general rule priori-\ntizing legal issues over equitable ones, it is a pruden-\ntial rule that is premised on the recognition that an \nequitable determination could have a collateral-estop-\npel effect on the merits of a legal claim. These con-\ncerns are not present for an exhaustion determina-\ntion, which is a threshold, pre-merits ruling that the \njury may revisit if an exhausted claim goes to trial. \nFurther, this Court has previously considered \nwhether application of the Beacon Theatres rule would \nundermine a federal statute. Here, the PLRA\u2019s pur-\nposes would be severely undercut by a jury trial on ex-\nhaustion.  \nFor these reasons, the Seventh Amendment does \nnot preserve the right to a jury trial on exhaustion of \nadministrative remedies where disputed facts regard-\ning exhaustion are intertwined with merits of a claim. \n\n16 \n \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe Seventh Amendment does not preserve \nthe right to a jury trial on factual questions \nconcerning exhaustion. \nJudges frequently decide disputed questions of \nfact without violating the Seventh Amendment, par-\nticularly with respect to threshold issues. It is thus no \nsurprise that all courts of appeal to have considered \nthe issue have held that \u201cjudges may resolve factual \ndisputes relevant to the exhaustion issue without the \nparticipation of a jury.\u201d Small v. Camden Cnty., 728 \nF.3d 265, 269\u201371 (3d Cir. 2013); see also Lee, 789 F.3d \nat 677\u201378; Albino, 747 F.3d at 1170\u201371; Messa v. \nGoord, 652 F.3d 305, 308\u201310 (2d Cir. 2011) (per cu-\nriam); Dillon v. Rogers, 596 F.3d 260, 270\u201372 (5th Cir. \n2010); Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741\u201342; Bryant v. Rich, 530 \nF.3d 1368, 1373\u201377 (11th Cir. 2008). These holdings \nare consistent with the Seventh Amendment, which \napplies only to issues tried by a jury in suits at com-\nmon law in 1791. Exhaustion, although unknown at \ncommon law, is rooted in equity and closely analogous \nto traditional equitable defenses, which were not his-\ntorically determined by juries.  \nA. This Court has held that judges can de-\ncide facts related to threshold issues\u2014\nlike exhaustion\u2014without violating the \nSeventh Amendment.  \nAs a general matter, \u201cissues of law are to be re-\nsolved by the court and issues of fact are to be deter-\nmined by the jury.\u201d Baltimore & Carolina Line, Inc. v. \nRedman, 295 U.S. 654, 657 (1935). But this broad \nproposition overstates the Amendment\u2019s sweep, for \n\n17 \n \n\u201cthe Seventh Amendment was never intended to es-\ntablish the jury as the exclusive mechanism for fact-\nfinding in civil cases.\u201d Atlas Roofing Co. v. Occupa-\ntional Safety & Health Review Comm\u2019n, 430 U.S. 442, \n460 (1977); see also Galloway v. United States, 319 \nU.S. 372, 390 (1943) (\u201cThe jury was not absolute mas-\nter of fact in 1791.\u201d). In this vein, this Court has held \nthat the Seventh Amendment \u201cwas designed to pre-\nserve the basic institution of jury trial in only its most \nfundamental elements, not the great mass of proce-\ndural forms and details, varying even then [in 1791] \nso widely among common-law jurisdictions.\u201d Gallo-\nway, 319 U.S. at 392; see also Walker v. N. M. & S. P. \nR. Co., 165 U.S. 593, 596 (1897) (\u201cThe seventh amend-\nment . . . does not attempt to regulate matters of \npleading or practice[.]\u201d).  \nJudges thus frequently decide disputed questions \nof fact without violating the Seventh Amendment. For \nexample, this Court has held that judges may decide \nquestions of fact related to subject-matter jurisdiction, \nWetmore v. Rymer, 169 U.S. 115, 120\u201322 (1898); dis-\ncovery disputes, Herbert v. Lando, 441 U.S. 153, 177 \n(1979); class certifications, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. \nDukes, 564 U.S. 338, 351\u201352 (2011); evidentiary objec-\ntions, Galloway, 319 U.S. at 390; motions for sum-\nmary judgment, Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 \nU.S. 322, 336 (1979); motions for directed verdict, Gal-\nloway, 283 U.S. at 391\u201395; and motions to set aside \nthe verdict, Gasoline Products Co. v. Champlin Refin-\ning Co., 283 U.S. 494, 497\u201398 (1943).  \n \n \n\n18 \n \nThis makes sense for at least two reasons. First, a \njudge\u2019s ability to determine fact disputes related to \nthreshold questions is consistent with the under-\nstanding that \u201c \u2018[t]he Seventh Amendment does not \nconfer the right to a trial, but only the right to have a \njury hear the case once it is determined that the litiga-\ntion should proceed before a court.\u2019 \u201d Caley v. Gulf-\nstream Aerospace Corp., 428 F.3d 1359, 1371 (11th \nCir. 2005) (quoting Am. Heritage Life Ins. Co. v. Orr, \n294 F.3d 702, 711 (5th Cir. 2002)), cert. denied, 548 \nU.S. 1128 (2006). In this sense a judge acts as a gate-\nkeeper, guarding the courthouse doors from those who \nseek entry but have not yet satisfied mandatory pre-\nconditions to suit. Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741 (\u201cJuries de-\ncide cases, not issues of judicial traffic control.\u201d).  \nSecond, and relatedly, \u201c[t]he limitation imposed \nby the [Seventh] [A]mendment is merely that enjoy-\nment of the right of trial by jury be not obstructed, and \nthat the ultimate determination of issues of fact by the \njury be not interfered with.\u201d In re Peterson, 253 U.S. \n300, 310 (1920) (emphasis added). In other words, the \nSeventh Amendment \u201cis concerned with substance \nand not with form.\u201d Dimick v. Schiedt, 293 U.S. 474, \n490 (1935); see also id. (\u201cThere is nothing in its history \nor language to suggest that the amendment had any \npurpose but to preserve the essentials of the jury trial \nas it was known to the common law before the adop-\ntion of the Constitution.\u201d); Walker, 165 U.S. at 596 \n(\u201cSo long as this substance of right is preserved, the \nprocedure by which this result shall be reached is \nwholly within the discretion of the legislature . . . .\u201d). \nWhere the jury\u2019s ultimate determination of the facts is \nnot obviated, the judge may serve as factfinder. \n\n19 \n \nBoth of these underpinnings apply with full force \nin the exhaustion context. Exhaustion is a threshold \nquestion. Under the PLRA, \u201c[u]ntil the issue of ex-\nhaustion is resolved, the court cannot know whether \nit is to decide the case or the prison authorities are to.\u201d \nPavey, 544 F.3d at 741. Further, a judge\u2019s exhaustion \ndetermination does not interfere with a jury\u2019s ulti-\nmate factfinding responsibility because dismissals for \nfailure to exhaust are generally without prejudice.2 \nSee Snider v. Melindez, 199 F.3d 108, 111\u201312 (2d Cir. \n1999) (explaining that exhaustion \u201cis often a tempo-\nrary, curable, procedural flaw\u201d). A prisoner may later \nrefile the lawsuit, so long as the prison\u2019s grievance \nprocedure is satisfied. And if the prisoner\u2019s case ulti-\nmately proceeds to trial, the jury may revisit facts \nfound by the judge that may have been relevant to the \nexhaustion determination. See Part II; see also Pavey, \n544 F.3d at 742.  \nB. The Seventh Amendment does not pre-\nserve the right to a jury trial on any fac-\ntual questions concerning exhaustion be-\ncause exhaustion derives from equity.  \nAlthough the types of claims Richards brought are \nthose to which a jury trial applies, this Court has \n \n2 Along these lines, some courts have identified exhaustion as \nmatter in abatement, Bryant, 530 F.3d at 1374; Small, 728 F.3d \nat 269 n.3 (citation omitted), which is unsurprising since \u201cabate-\nment defense[s] defeat the particular action for procedural de-\nfects that are unrelated to the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claim,\u201d and \nthe plaintiff can therefore \u201ctypically correct the defects and pro-\nceed in another action,\u201d Hyman v. City of Gastonia, 466 F.3d 284, \n287 (4th Cir. 2006) (citing Bowles v. Wilke, 175 F.2d 35, 38 (7th \nCir. 1949)).  \n\n20 \n \nrecognized the need for a separate historical analysis \nfor particular issues or trial decisions within jury-ap-\npropriate claims. Under this analysis, there is no ex-\nact antecedent for exhaustion. But its equitable ori-\ngins and the characteristics of the doctrine show that \nits closest parallel lies in equitable defenses\u2014which \nwere historically decided by judges, not juries.  \n1. The Seventh Amendment guarantees \na jury trial right only as to issues \ntried by a jury in suits at common law \nat the time the Seventh Amendment \nwas adopted.  \nThe Seventh Amendment \u201cpreserve[s]\u201d the right \nto jury trial \u201c[i]n Suits at common law.\u201d U.S. Const. \namend. VII. Because the Amendment speaks in terms \nof preservation, this Court has long held that the \nscope of the right must be determined by reference to \nhistory. Indeed, \u201c[f]rom the beginning, it has been re-\ngarded as but subservient to the single purpose of the \nAmendment, to preserve the essentials of the jury \ntrial in actions at law, serving to distinguish them \nfrom suits in equity and admiralty[.]\u201d Dimick, 293 \nU.S. at 490\u201391 (citation omitted); Granfinanciera, \nS.A. v. Nordberg, 492 U.S. 33, 42 (1989) (explaining \nthat the Seventh Amendment applies to actions \u201cthat \nare analogous to common-law causes of action ordi-\nnarily decided in English law courts in the late 18th \ncentury, as opposed to those customarily heard by \ncourts of equity or admiralty\u201d) (citation omitted). Con-\nsistent with this command, \u201cresort must be had to the \nappropriate rules of the common law established at \nthe time of the adoption of that constitutional provi-\nsion in 1791.\u201d Dimick, 293 U.S. at 476. See also \n\n21 \n \nBaltimore & Carolina Line, Inc., 295 U.S. at 657 \n(\u201c[T]he right of trial by jury thus preserved is the right \nwhich existed under the English common law when \nthe Amendment was adopted.\u201d).  \nThis historical lens does not mean that the right \nto a jury trial is available only in suits \u201cwhich the com-\nmon law recognized among its old and settled proceed-\nings.\u201d Parsons v. Bedford, Breedlove & Robeson, 28 \nU.S. 433, 447 (1830). As this Court has noted, histori-\ncal analysis allows for reasoning by analogy. There-\nfore, the determination whether the Seventh Amend-\nment confers a right to a jury trial entails a two-part \ninquiry. A court first considers whether it is \u201c \u2018dealing \nwith a cause of action that either was tried at law at \nthe time of the founding or is at least analogous to one \nthat was.\u2019 \u201d City of Monterey v. Del Monte Dunes at \nMonterey, Ltd., 526 U.S. 687, 708 (1999) (quoting \nMarkman, 517 U.S. at 376). If a court determines that \n\u201cthe action in question belongs in the law category,\u201d it \nmust \u201cthen ask whether the particular trial decision \nmust fall to the jury in order to preserve the substance \nof the common-law right as it existed in 1791.\u201d Mark-\nman, 517 U.S. at 708 (emphasis added). See also Tull, \n481 U.S. at 426 (\u201c \u2018Only those incidents which are re-\ngarded as fundamental, as inherent in and of the es-\nsence of the system of trial by jury, are placed beyond \nthe reach of the legislature.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting Colgrove, 413 \nU.S. at 156 n.11.).  \nAs applied to this case, the first inquiry is \nstraightforward. While the scope of prisoners\u2019 federal \nrights was significantly limited at common law, see, \ne.g., Ruffin v. Commonwealth, 62 Va. 790, 799 (1871); \nBethea v. Crouse, 417 F.2d 504, 505 (10th Cir. 1969), \n\n22 \n \nfollowing Del Monte Dunes, 526 U.S. at 720\u201321, the \ntypes of claims that Richards brought\u2014\u00a7 1983 claims \nfor damages\u2014are those for which a jury trial applies.  \nThis conclusion is not the end of the inquiry, \nthough. Rather, it leads to the second question\u2014\nwhether the particular issue of exhaustion is \u201cproper \nfor determination by the jury.\u201d3 Id. at 718; see also id. \nat 731 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and in concurring \nin the judgment) (\u201cTo say that respondents had the \nright to a jury trial on their \u00a7 1983 claim is not to say \nthat they were entitled to have the jury decide every \nissue.\u201d); Google LLC v. Oracle Am., Inc. 593 U.S. 1, 25 \n(2021) (rejecting an argument that the jury should de-\ncide a fair-use defense). As explained below, it is not.  \n2. Exhaustion did not exist at the com-\nmon law, but closely analogous equi-\ntable issues were not decided by ju-\nries in 1791.  \nTo answer the second question\u2014whether exhaus-\ntion should be determined by a judge or jury\u2014this \nCourt again looks to history, asking \u201cwhether the par-\nticular issue, or analogous ones, were decided by judge \nor by jury in suits at common law at the time the Sev-\nenth Amendment was adopted.\u201d Del Monte Dunes, 526 \nU.S. at 718; see also Markman, 517 U.S. at 378 \n(\u201cWhere there is no exact antecedent, the best hope \n \n3 The practice of submitting some issues for judicial determina-\ntion, while others are submitted to the jury, is consistent with \nFed. R. Civ. P. 39(a) and (a)(2), which provides that a \u201ctrial on all \nissues so demanded must be by jury unless . . . the court . . . finds \nthat on some or all of those issues there is no federal right to a \njury trial.\u201d (Emphasis added).  \n\n23 \n \nlies in comparing the modern practice to earlier ones \nwhose allocation to court or jury we do know . . . seek-\ning the best analogy we can draw between an old and \nthe new.\u201d) (citations omitted); Tull, 481 U.S. at 420\u2013\n21 (explaining that courts must search the common \nlaw for \u201cappropriate analogies\u201d instead of a \u201cprecisely \nanalogous common-law cause of action\u201d). \nAlthough no exact antecedent for exhaustion ex-\nisted at common law, its origins lie in equity. These \norigins and exhaustion\u2019s characteristics result in an \nappropriate analog\u2014equitable defenses\u2014for which \nthere was no traditional right to a jury trial. \na. No historical antecedent to exhaustion \nexisted at common law, but its origins \nare equitable in nature. \nThe doctrine of exhaustion \u201cis as old as federal ad-\nministrative law,\u201d meaning that it did not begin to \ntake shape until the creation of the Interstate Com-\nmerce Commission in 1887. Raoul Berger, Exhaustion \nof Administrative Remedies, 48 Yale L.J. 981, 981 n.1 \n(1939). Intended as a rule of \u201corderly\u201d procedure de-\nsigned to allow administrative bodies to perform their \nstatutory functions without preliminary interference \nfrom the courts, United States v. Sing Tuck, 194 U.S. \n161, 168 (1904), the concept first arose in tax cases in \nwhich courts of equity refused to grant injunctive re-\nlief where a plaintiff failed to pursue administrative \nremedies.  \nIn Dundee Mortgage Trust Invest Co. v. Charlton, \n32 F. 192, 192\u201393 (C.C.D. Ore. 1887), for example, a \ncorporation brought suit in equity to enjoin the \n\n24 \n \ncollection of its taxes, arguing that the county asses-\nsor and county board of equalization had erred in their \nassessment. While the court agreed that the corpora-\ntion \u201cappear[ed] to be entitled to an injunction,\u201d id. at \n193, it nevertheless held that the corporation was not \nentitled to relief because it did not seek redress from \nthe county board of equalization, as provided by stat-\nute, id. at 193\u201394. \u201c[T]he plaintiff, having neglected to \navail itself of this means of redress, cannot maintain \na suit for relief in this court.\u201d Id. at 195; see also Alt-\nschul v. Gittings, 86 F. 200, 202 (C.C.D. Ore. 1898) \n(No. 2,236) (same); Brown v. Drain, 112 F. 582, 585 \n(C.C.S.D. Cal. 1901) (\u201cThe remedy of one who consid-\ners himself unfairly assessed is to apply for redress to \nthe statutory tribunal, if one is provided with the \npower to review.\u201d).  \nThe exhaustion concept was applied in courts of \nequity in other contexts as well. In Sing Tuck, an im-\nmigration case in which the Court denied a writ a ha-\nbeas corpus, the Court concluded that the petitioner \nfailed to comply with the \u201cmode of procedure which \nmust be followed before there can be resort to the \ncourts.\u201d 194 U.S. at 167. Explaining that \u201cit is one of \nthe necessities of the administration of justice that \neven fundamental questions should be determined in \nan orderly way,\u201d the Court reasoned that the peti-\ntioner failed to first file an appeal with the Secretary \nof Commerce and Labor. Id. at 168. The Court analo-\ngized the exhaustion requirement to habeas corpus \ncases arising out of state confinement:  \nA familiar illustration is that of a person im-\nprisoned upon criminal process by a state \ncourt, under a state law alleged to be \n\n25 \n \nunconstitutional. If the law is unconstitu-\ntional the prisoner is wrongfully held. Yet, ex-\ncept under exceptional circumstances, the \ncourts of the United States do not interfere by \nhabeas corpus. The prisoner must, in the first \nplace, take his case to the highest court of the \nstate to which he can go, and after that he gen-\nerally is left to the remedy by writ of error if \nhe wishes to bring the case here.  \nId. (citations omitted). Because the petitioner failed to \nfirst resort to his administrative remedy, any attempt \n\u201cto swamp the courts by resort to them in the first in-\nstance[ ] must fail.\u201d Id. at 170; see also id. (\u201c[B]efore \nthe courts can be called upon, the preliminary sifting \nprocess provided by the statutes must be gone through \nwith. Whether after that a further trial may be had \nwe do not decide.\u201d). Other cases highlight exhaustion\u2019s \nequitable origins. E.g. Pittsburgh Ry. v. Bd. of Pub. \nWorks, 172 U.S. 32, 47 (1898); United States v. Abilene \n& S. Ry. Co., 265 U.S. 274, 282 (1924); United States \nv. Ill. Cent. R.R. Co., 291 U.S. 457, 463 (1934); Natural \nGas Pipeline Co. v. Slattery, 302 U.S. 300, 310\u201311 \n(1937).  \nWhile these cases confirm exhaustion\u2019s equitable \norigins, the doctrine, as we understand it today, did \nnot fully emerge until the twentieth century. See John \nF. Duffy, Administrative Common Law in Judicial Re-\nview, 77 Tex. L. Rev. 113, 154 (1998) (explaining that \n\u201c[i]n the early part of th[e] [twentieth] century, the \ndoctrine was still quite amorphous, and as late as the \n1920\u2019s, courts were still using other equitable doc-\ntrines . . . to decide cases that would later be consid-\nered exhaustion precedents\u201d). Indeed, it was only in \n\n26 \n \n1938, in Myers v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Co., 303 \nU.S. 41 (1938), that this Court expressly articulated \nthe modern underpinning of the doctrine. See Duffy, \nsupra, at 155.  \nIn Myers, the Court declined a request to enjoin \nthe National Labor Relations Board\u2019s administrative \nproceedings despite allegations that the NLRB lacked \njurisdiction. Id. at 43, 46. The Court refused to grant \ninjunctive relief, in part on the ground that \u201cno one is \nentitled to judicial relief for a supposed or threatened \ninjury until the prescribed administrative remedy has \nbeen exhausted.\u201d Id. at 50. The Court recognized the \nexhaustion doctrine\u2019s equitable roots, see id. at 51 n.9 \n(\u201cThe rule has been most frequently applied in equity \nwhere relief by injunction was sought\u201d) (citation omit-\nted), and noted the extension of the doctrine to courts \nof law, id. (\u201cbecause the rule is one of judicial admin-\nistration\u2014not merely a rule governing the exercise of \ndiscretion\u2014it is applicable to proceedings at law as \nwell as suits in equity\u201d) (citations omitted). Myers \nstands as \u201cthe seminal decision\u201d on the exhaustion \ndoctrine and has been described as \u201ccomplet[ing] the \ndoctrine\u2019s evolution.\u201d Duffy, supra, at 155. \nIn short, although exhaustion has deep roots in \nequity, the doctrine as we know it today was unknown \nin the late eighteenth century. Consequently, there is \nno \u201cclear historical evidence that the very . . . ques-\ntion\u201d of exhaustion was a question for the jury under \nthe common law. Markman, 517 U.S. at 377. \n\n27 \n \nb. Traditional equitable defenses such as \nadequate remedy at law, forum non \nconveniens, abstention, and habeas \ncorpus bars are an appropriate com-\nmon-law analog for exhaustion.  \nWith no precise analog existing in the English \ncommon law, \u201cthe best hope lies in comparing the \nmodern practice to earlier ones whose allocation to \ncourt or jury we do know, . . . seeking the best analogy \nwe can draw between the old and the new.\u201d Markman, \n517 U.S. at 378 (citations omitted). In this regard, this \nCourt has instructed that the analog be \u201cappropriate\u201d \nrather than \u201cprecise[ ],\u201d Tull, 481 U.S. at 420\u201321, and \ncan be drawn on the basis of function, Markman, 517 \nU.S. at 379\u201380.  \nExhaustion\u2019s foundations in courts of equity pro-\nvide a logical starting point in the search for an appro-\npriate analog. As explained in the prior section, from \nits earliest articulations, it was viewed as a limitation, \nalbeit discretionary, on a court\u2019s equitable jurisdic-\ntion. See Charlton, 32 F. at 195; Altschul, 86 F. at 202. \nIn other words, a court of equity would not exercise its \nextraordinary powers where a plaintiff failed to avail \nitself of an available administrative process. Gorham \nMfg. Co. v. State Tax Comm\u2019n of N.Y., 266 U.S. 265, \n270 (1924) (holding that the petitioner, \u201chaving failed \nto avail itself of the administrative remedy provided \nby the statute . . . was not entitled to maintain a bill \nin equity\u201d); Ill. Cent. R.R. Co., 291 U.S. at 463 (\u201cThe \nvarious steps to be taken constitute parts of the ad-\nministrative process which must be completed before \nthe extraordinary powers of a court of equity may be \ninvoked.\u201d) (citation omitted); Slattery, 302 U.S. 300, \n310\u201311 (1937) (\u201cThe rule that a suitor must exhaust \n\n28 \n \nhis administrative remedies before seeking the ex-\ntraordinary relief of a court of equity . . . is of special \nforce when resort is had to the federal courts to re-\nstrain the action of state officers.\u201d) (citations omitted); \nIsland Creek Coal Co. v. Bryan, 937 F.3d 738, 748 (6th \nCir. 2019) (noting that \u201cthe exhaustion \u2018doctrine had \nits origin in a discretionary rule adopted by courts of \nequity to the effect that a petitioner will be denied eq-\nuitable relief when he has failed to pursue an availa-\nble administrative remedy by which he might obtain \nthe same relief.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting Smith v. United States, \n199 F.2d 377, 381 (1st Cir. 1952)).  \nThus, historically, exhaustion was an equitable \ndefense applied by courts when another forum\u2014an \nadministrative tribunal or agency\u2014was the more ap-\npropriate starting point for a dispute. Tracking this \nprinciple, this Court has said that exhaustion \u201cserves \nthe twin purposes of protecting administrative agency \nauthority and promoting judicial efficiency.\u201d McCar-\nthy v. Madigan, 503 U.S. 140, 145 (1992), superseded \nby statute, \u00a7 1997e(a), as recognized in Woodford, 548 \nU.S. at 84\u201385. As to the first purpose, the exhaustion \nrequirement \u201crecognizes the notion, grounded in def-\nerence to Congress\u2019 delegation of authority to coordi-\nnate branches of Government, that agencies, not the \ncourts, ought to have primary responsibility for the \nprograms that Congress has charged them to admin-\nister.\u201d Id.; see id. (\u201cThe exhaustion doctrine recognizes \nthe commonsense notion of dispute resolution that an \nagency ought to have an opportunity to correct its own \nmistakes . . . before it is haled into federal court.\u201d) (em-\nphasis added); Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 492 \n(1973) (\u201cSince the[ ] internal problems of state prisons \ninvolve issues so peculiarly within state authority and \n\n29 \n \nexpertise, the States have an important interest in not \nbeing bypassed in the correction of those problems.\u201d). \nAs to the second purpose, \u201c[w]hen an agency has the \nopportunity to correct its own errors, a judicial contro-\nversy may well be mooted, or at least piecemeal ap-\npeals may be avoided.\u201d McCarthy, 503 U.S. at 145 (ci-\ntations omitted).  \nThese twin purposes call back to early articula-\ntions of the exhaustion doctrine as a rule of \u201corderly\u201d \nprocedure. Sing Tuck, 194 U.S. at 168, 173. And alt-\nhough the exhaustion doctrine was discretionary, as \nopposed to jurisdictional, Slattery, 302 U.S. at 311 (ex-\nplaining that the rule \u201crests in the sound discretion \nwhich guides exercise of equity jurisdiction\u201d) (cita-\ntions omitted); Abilene & S. Ry. Co., 265 U.S. at 282, \nit nevertheless was treated by courts of equity as a \nthreshold inquiry, see Sing Tuck, 194 U.S. at 168, 170.  \nThese guideposts offer a clear path in the search \nfor an appropriate common law analog. Indeed, ex-\nhaustion\u2019s origins as a forum-based equitable defense \ncall to mind other similar equitable defenses\u2014the ad-\nequate remedy at law doctrine, forum non conveniens, \nabstention, and habeas corpus bars.  \nAdequate remedy at law. The adequate remedy at \nlaw doctrine was a fundamental principle guiding \ncourts of equity. These courts \u201cstood ready to fashion \nremedies for legal wrongs, so long as the basic require-\nments of equity\u2014such as irreparable injury and no \nadequate remedy at law\u2014were met.\u201d Duffy, supra, at \n124. See also Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 43\u201344 \n(1971) (\u201cOne is the basic doctrine of equity jurispru-\ndence that courts of equity should not act . . . when the \nmoving party has an adequate remedy at law and will \n\n30 \n \nnot suffer irreparable injury if denied equitable re-\nlief.\u201d); Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U.S. \n374, 381 (1992) (\u201cIt is a \u2018basic doctrine of equity juris-\nprudence that courts of equity should not act . . . when \nthe moving party has an adequate remedy at law[.]\u2019 \u201d) \n(citations omitted).  \nThe adequate remedy at law doctrine was \ngrounded in comity and federalism concerns, with fed-\neral equity courts refusing to provide relief where it \nwas available at law in federal courts of law, Great \nLakes Co. v. Huffman, 319 U.S. 293, 297 (1943) (cita-\ntion omitted), as well as in state proceedings, Trainor \nv. Hernandez, 431 U.S. 434, 441 (1977). This doctrine, \nlike exhaustion, thus focused on whether a court of eq-\nuity should defer to another court (or forum) to hear \nthe dispute. And, like exhaustion, courts viewed the \ndoctrine as a threshold issue. Brown, Bonnell & Co. v. \nLake Superior Iron Co., 134 U.S. 530, 536 (1890) (ex-\nplaining that the adequate remedy at law objection \n\u201cshould be taken at the earliest opportunity\u201d). \nForum non conveniens. Under this equitable, com-\nmon-law doctrine, a federal court may dismiss an ac-\ntion in favor of an alternative forum when, among \nother things, \u201cthe chosen forum [is] inappropriate be-\ncause of considerations affecting the court\u2019s own ad-\nministration and legal problems.\u201d Koster v. Am. Lum-\nbermens Mut. Cas. Co., 330 U.S. 518, 524 (1947); see \nalso Gulf Oil Corp. v. Gilbert, 330 U.S. 501, 506\u201307 \n(1947) (explaining that the doctrine is premised on the \nassumption that there are \u201cat least two forums in \nwhich the defendant is amenable to process\u201d). Both fo-\nrum non conveniens and exhaustion therefore permit \ncourts to consider judicial efficiency in deciding \n\n31 \n \nwhether they are the appropriate forum for a case to \nbe heard. See Sinochem Int\u2019l Co. v. Malaysia Int\u2019l \nShipping Corp., 549 U.S. 422, 432 (2007) (\u201cA district \ncourt . . . may dispose of an action by a forum non con-\nveniens dismissal, bypassing questions of subject-mat-\nter and personal jurisdiction, when considerations of \nconvenience, fairness, and judicial economy so war-\nrant.\u201d).  \nAbstention. \u201c[E]xhaustion of administrative reme-\ndies\u201d in general and \u201cabstention\u201d are \u201crelated doc-\ntrines.\u201d McCarthy, 503 U.S. at 144. As with exhaus-\ntion, the power of a federal court to dismiss a case via \nabstention \u201cderives from the discretion historically \nenjoyed by courts of equity.\u201d Quackenbush v. Allstate \nIns. Co., 517 U.S. 706, 728 (1996). The driving princi-\nples behind exhaustion and abstention also share a \ncommon root\u2014deference to state or administrative \nauthority. See id. at 728 (quoting Burford v. Sun Oil \nCo., 319 U.S. 315, 334 (1943)). Younger abstention, for \nexample, respects a \u201cState\u2019s interest in pursuing an \nongoing state proceeding,\u201d Ohio Bureau of Emp. \nServs. v. Hodory, 431 U.S. 471, 477 (1977) (citations \nomitted), barring a federal court from enjoining a \nstate prosecution, a civil enforcement action, or a \nunique state action that \u201cimplicate[s] a State\u2019s inter-\nest in enforcing the orders and judgments of its \ncourts,\u201d Sprint Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v. Jacobs, 571 U.S. 69, \n72\u201373 (2013). Likewise, PLRA exhaustion requires a \nfederal court to stay its hand where a state has not \nhad its full opportunity to regulate its own prisons by \nconsidering a prisoner\u2019s grievance. \nHabeas Corpus. Federal habeas principles rein-\nforce the analogy between exhaustion and equitable \n\n32 \n \ndefenses. Indeed, this Court explicitly linked PLRA \nexhaustion requirements to certain habeas defenses, \ndeeming them \u201csubstantively similar.\u201d Woodford, 548 \nU.S. at 92; see also Schlesinger v. Councilman, 420 \nU.S. 738, 756 (1975) (noting that \u201cthe practical consid-\nerations supporting . . . the exhaustion requirement in \nhabeas corpus . . . are similar to those that underlie \nthe requirement of exhaustion of administrative rem-\nedies\u201d) (citation omitted).  \nHabeas exhaustion, like PLRA exhaustion, \nsounds in equity. Withrow v. Williams, 507 U.S. 680, \n699 (1993) (\u201cConcerns for equity and federalism reso-\nnate throughout our habeas jurisprudence.\u201d) (Scalia, \nJ., concurring in part); Erica Hashimoto, Reclaiming \nthe Equitable Heritage of Habeas, 108 Nw. U. L. Rev. \n139, 142 (2013) (habeas defenses \u201cshare features that \ncorrespond with the [habeas] remedy\u2019s historical equi-\ntable origins\u201d). Premised on the same equitable under-\npinnings as administrative exhaustion, habeas ex-\nhaustion requires a prisoner to avail himself of all \n\u201cavailable\u201d state-court remedies before entering fed-\neral court to seek a writ of habeas corpus. 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2254(c); see also O\u2019Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U.S. \n838, 847 (1999). \nThe doctrine of procedural default, 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2254(b)(1)(A), (c), another limitation on habeas re-\nlief, also shares similarities with exhaustion. It pre-\nvents federal court review of a claim that has not been \nproperly presented to the state courts. Woodford, 548 \nU.S. at 92. Procedural default guards against \u201cover-\nturning a state-court conviction without the state \ncourts having had an opportunity to correct the con-\nstitutional violation in the first instance.\u201d Id. (quoting \n\n33 \n \nO\u2019Sullivan, 526 U.S. at 845). That requirement mir-\nrors PLRA exhaustion\u2014giving prison systems the op-\nportunity to correct violations before litigating in fed-\neral court. See Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509, 518\u201319 \n(1982). \n3. Juries did not historically determine \nquestions of fact related to equitable \ndefenses analogous to exhaustion.  \nWith these similarities in mind, these equitable \ndefenses offer a sound analog to exhaustion, and \neighteenth-century practices concerning these de-\nfenses are instructive. It is well understood that a \nplaintiff is not entitled to have a jury determine a dis-\nputed affirmative defense that is equitable in nature. \nLiberty Oil Co. v. Condon Nat\u2019l Bank, 260 U.S. 235, \n242\u201343 (1922) (\u201cThe equitable defense makes the is-\nsue equitable, and it is to be tried to the judge as a \nchancellor.\u201d); Tull, 481 U.S. at 417 (\u201c[T]hose actions \nthat are analogous to 18th-century cases tried in \ncourts of equity . . . do not require a jury trial.\u201d) (cita-\ntion omitted); Granite State Ins. Co. v. Smart Modular \nTechs., 76 F.3d 1023, 1027 (9th Cir. 1996) (\u201cA litigant \nis not entitled to have a jury resolve a disputed affirm-\native defense if the defense is equitable in nature.\u201d) \n(citation omitted); Smith v. World Ins. Co., 38 F.3d \n1456, 1462 (8th Cir. 1994) (\u201c[T]he determination of eq-\nuitable defenses and equitable remedies is a matter \nfor the court to decide, not the jury.\u201d). This was true \neven where an equitable defense was \u201cinterposed in \n[an] action at law,\u201d in which circumstance the equita-\nble defense was generally \u201cfirst . . . disposed of as in a \ncourt of equity, and then, if an issue at law remain[ed], \nit [was] triable to a jury.\u201d Liberty Oil Co., 260 U.S. at \n\n34 \n \n242 (citations omitted). This equity-first order of oper-\nations was laid out by this Court over 100 years ago:  \nThe same order is preserved as under the sys-\ntem of separate courts. If a defendant at law \nhad an equitable defense, he resorted to a bill \nin equity to enjoin the suit at law, until he \ncould make his equitable defense effective by \na hearing before the chancellor. The hearing \non that bill was before the chancellor, and not \nbefore a jury, and, if the prayer of the bill was \ngranted, the injunction against the suit at law \nwas made perpetual, and no jury trial ensued. \nIf the injunction was denied, the suit at law \nproceeded to verdict and judgment. This was \nthe practice in the courts of law and chancery \nin England when our Constitution and the \nSeventh Amendment were adopted, and it is \nin the light of such practice that the Seventh \nAmendment is to be construed. \nId. at 243.  \n* * * \nIn sum, exhaustion was not part of the common \nlaw in 1791, and it has its origins in equity. This his-\ntorical background, along with exhaustion\u2019s func-\ntional similarities to forum-based equitable defenses \nsuch as adequate remedy at law, forum non conven-\niens, abstention, and habeas bars\u2014all historically \nnon-jury issues\u2014leads to the conclusion that the Sev-\nenth Amendment does not require juries to try ex-\nhaustion inquiries.  \n\n35 \n \n4. Functional considerations demon-\nstrate that judges, not juries, should \ndetermine exhaustion questions.  \nEven if history did not provide a clear answer, this \nCourt can, as a last resort, \u201clook elsewhere\u201d\u2015including \nat \u201cstatutory policies\u201d and the respective skills of \njudges and juries\u2015to inform the proper allocation be-\ntween a court or jury for purposes of the Seventh \nAmendment. Markman, 517 U.S. at 384; see also Del \nMonte Dunes, 526 U.S. at 718 (citation omitted). \nBeginning with the statutory policies at issue, the \nPLRA\u2019s statutory history is well documented. \u201cCon-\ngress enacted the [PLRA] . . . in 1996 in the wake of a \nsharp rise in prisoner litigation in the federal courts.\u201d \nWoodford, 548 U.S. at 84 (citing Alexander, 159 F.3d \nat 1324\u201325). The statute thus contains a variety of \ngatekeeping provisions \u201cdesigned to bring this litiga-\ntion under control.\u201d Id. (citations omitted). A \u201ccenter-\npiece\u201d of this effort is the PLRA\u2019s exhaustion require-\nment. Id. (citation omitted). \nThe PLRA\u2019s exhaustion requirement was, \u201cbeyond \ndoubt,\u201d \u201cenacted . . . to reduce the quantity and im-\nprove the quality of prisoner suits[.]\u201d Porter, 534 U.S. \nat 524. To this end, the provision \u201cafford[s] corrections \nofficials time and opportunity to address complaints \ninternally before allowing the initiation of a federal \ncase.\u201d Id. at 525 (emphasis added); see also Woodford, \n548 U.S. at 93 (\u201cThe PLRA attempts to eliminate un-\nwarranted federal-court interference with the admin-\nistration of prisons . . . .\u201d). This might \u201cobviat[e] the \nneed for litigation\u201d in some instances, or it might \u201cfil-\nter out some frivolous claims.\u201d Porter, 534 U.S. at 525 \n(citing Booth, 532 U.S. at 737). For cases that do make \n\n36 \n \nit to court, \u201cadjudication could be facilitated by an ad-\nministrative record that clarifies the contours of the \ncontroversy.\u201d Id. (citing Booth, 532 U.S. at 737); see \nalso Woodford, 548 U.S. at 95 (\u201cWhen a grievance is \nfiled shortly after the event giving rise to the griev-\nance, witnesses can be identified and questioned while \nmemories are still fresh, and evidence can be gathered \nand preserved.\u201d). These goals mirror the purposes of \ntraditional administrative exhaustion\u2014they safe-\nguard \u201cadministrative agency authority and pro-\nmot[e] judicial efficiency.\u201d McCarthy, 503 U.S. at 145.  \nThese goals would be severely undercut if a court \nwere to permit an exhaustion question to go to the \njury. Prison officials would be denied the opportunity \nto address and potentially rectify complaints inter-\nnally. Unexhausted claims could proceed to discovery \nwithout the benefits of full administrative record. \nMost critically, exhaustion questions would require ei-\nther a mini-jury trial before the merits adjudication or \na jury trial heard simultaneously with the merits. In \neither scenario, judicial resources and jurors\u2019 time \nwould be expended on claims that should never have \nreached the courthouse doors. Such a result directly \ncontradicts the PLRA\u2019s aims. \nOn the second point, judges\u2019 established role as \ngatekeepers in prisoner lawsuits supports the conclu-\nsion that judges, not juries, are \u201cbetter suited\u201d to as-\ncertain a prisoner\u2019s compliance with the exhaustion \nrequirement. See Markman, 517 U.S. at 384, 388\u201389 \n(consulting \u201cexisting precedent\u201d and considering \u201cthe \nrelative interpretive skills of judges and juries\u201d); Del \nMonte Dunes, 526 U.S. at 720 (looking to \u201cconsidera-\ntions of process and function\u201d). As explained in Part \n\n37 \n \nI(A), judges routinely resolve threshold issues and act \nas gatekeepers on factual questions that would other-\nwise be presented to the jury. This is especially true \nin PLRA cases, where, due to the sheer volume of pris-\noner lawsuits, Alexander, 159 F.3d at 1324, judges are \nwell-acquainted with the internal operations of prison \nsystems and their multi-level grievance processes. \nThe screening requirement of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A rein-\nforces this notion, as judges already ensure compli-\nance with other aspects of the PLRA. This knowledge \nbase has well prepared the judiciary to settle ques-\ntions surrounding exhaustion under the PLRA. \nThese considerations provide sufficient reason to \ntreat the disposition of questions of fact concerning ex-\nhaustion like many other factfinding responsibilities \nceded to judges in the normal course of litigation.  \nII. The Seventh Amendment does not preserve \nthe right to a jury trial on factual questions \nconcerning exhaustion even when those fac-\ntual questions are intertwined with the un-\nderlying merits. \nAt common law, the Seventh Amendment did not \npreserve the right to a jury trial on equitable defenses \nsuch as exhaustion. Following the merger of the courts \nof law and equity in 1938, however, courts have recog-\nnized that \u201c[d]ifficulties may arise . . . when the legal \nand equitable issues overlap and the evidence is inter-\ntwined.\u201d Danjaq LLC v. Sony Corp., 263 F.3d 942, 962 \n(9th Cir. 2001); Ross v. Bernhard, 396 U.S. 531, 536\u2013\n39 (1970). This Court has held that, as a prudential \nmatter, where factual issues overlap between legal \nand equitable issues, jury-triable issues should \n\n38 \n \ngenerally be prioritized. See, e.g., Beacon Theatres, \n359 U.S. at 510\u201311; Dairy Queen, Inc. v. Wood, 369 \nU.S. 469, 472\u201373 (1962).  \nBut exhaustion remains a threshold precondition \nto suit that, by its nature, must be determined before \nthe merits. With that that order of operation in mind, \nthis Court has applied the Beacon Theatres principle \nonly where an equitable claim could, through collat-\neral estoppel or res judicata, bar a subsequent jury \ntrial on a legal claim. Exhaustion does not present \nsuch a circumstance. And, in any event, this Court has \nconsidered departure from the Beacon Theatres pru-\ndential rule when it would undercut congressional in-\ntent, as it would here. For these reasons, Richards \ndoes not have a jury trial right on factual questions \nconcerning exhaustion\u2014even when those questions \nare intertwined with the merits of his claims.  \nA. Beacon Theatres created a presumption \nthat juries should decide intertwined le-\ngal and equitable issues, but that pre-\nsumption does not apply here.  \nBeacon Theatres stands for the proposition that, \nwhere legal and equitable claims are grounded in the \nsame set of facts, the right to a jury trial on the legal \nclaims should prevail, precluding a prior determina-\ntion of the equitable claims. This \u201cgeneral prudential \nrule,\u201d Parklane Hosiery, 439 U.S. at 334, is primarily \nconcerned with the collateral estoppel or res judicata \neffect that an inverse ordering would present, id. See \nalso Katchen v. Landy, 382 U.S. 323, 339\u201340 (1966) \n(explaining that Beacon Theatres announced an \u201cequi-\ntable doctrine,\u201d not a bright-line rule). Consequently, \n\n39 \n \nall order-of-trial problems should, \u201cwherever possi-\nble,\u201d be resolved in favor of granting a jury trial to pre-\nserve the Seventh Amendment right. Beacon Thea-\ntres, 359 U.S. at 510. The resolution of an exhaustion \nquestion, however, does not present such a scenario.  \nBeacon Theatres involved a dispute between two \ntheatres regarding the validity of contracts in which \nthe film distributors had given one of the theatres, \nFox, the exclusive right to show \u201cfirst run pictures\u201d in \nthe area. Id. at 502. Because another theatre, Beacon, \n\u201cnotified Fox that it considered [the] contracts . . . to \nbe overt acts in violation of antitrust laws,\u201d id., Fox \nfiled suit seeking both declaratory judgment and an \ninjunction against Beacon asserting an antitrust \nclaim against it. Id. at 502\u201303. Beacon then filed a \ncounterclaim and cross-claim that the contracts vio-\nlated antitrust laws and requested treble damages. Id. \nat 503. Despite an issue of common fact among the \ncomplaint and counterclaim and Beacon\u2019s request for \na jury trial on legal issues, the district court ordered \nFox\u2019s claims, which were traditional suits in equity, to \nbe tried by the court before a determination of Bea-\ncon\u2019s claims. Id. at 503\u201304. The court of appeals af-\nfirmed, holding that the district judge could try the \nequitable claim first, even if it might preclude a jury \ntrial on the legal claims. Id. at 505.  \nThis Court disagreed. Reasoning that trying the \nequitable claims first could, by way of collateral estop-\npel or res judicata, bar a subsequent trial on the mer-\nits of Beacon\u2019s legal claims, the Court held that order-\nof-trial problems be resolved in favor of granting a \njury trial unless there are \u201cimperative circumstances, \ncircumstances which in view of the flexible procedures \n\n40 \n \nof the Federal Rules we cannot now anticipate.\u201d Id. at \n508; see id. at 504 (\u201c[I]f Beacon would have been enti-\ntled to a jury trial in a treble damage suit against Fox, \nit cannot be deprived of the right merely because Fox \ntook advantage of the availability of declaratory relief \nto sue Beacon first.\u201d); see also Parklane Hosiery, 439 \nU.S. at 333 (\u201cRecognition that an equitable determi-\nnation could have collateral-estoppel effect in a subse-\nquent legal action was the major premise of . . . Beacon \nTheatres.\u201d).  \nDairy Queen, decided three years later, involved \nsimilar timing concerns. There, the claims were both \nlegal (monetary damages for breach of contract) and \nequitable (relief in the form of injunction), and the dis-\ntrict court denied the defendants\u2019 demand for a jury \ntrial on the ground that the jury claim was only \u201cinci-\ndental\u201d to the non-jury claim. 369 U.S. at 470. This \nCourt, relying on Beacon Theatres, explained that \u201cthe \nright to trial by jury may [not] be lost as to legal issues \nwhere those are characterized as \u2018incidental\u2019 to equi-\ntable issues.\u201d Id. Again, the Court was concerned with \nthe preclusive effect that a determination on equitable \nissues would have on legal ones. Id. at 472\u201373. \nBeacon Theatres is therefore instructive in deter-\nmining the order of trial on merits-based arguments. \nWhere a party has a right to a jury trial on a legal \nclaim, the order of trial should be arranged to preserve \nthat right. This is consistent with \u201c[t]he limitation im-\nposed by the [Seventh] [A]mendment . . . that the ul-\ntimate determination of issues of fact by the jury be \nnot interfered with.\u201d In re Peterson, 253 U.S. at 310 \n(emphasis added); see also Markman, 517 U.S. at 377 \n(asking \u201cwhether a particular issue . . . is itself \n\n41 \n \nnecessarily a jury issue, the guarantee being essential \nto preserve the right to a jury\u2019s resolution of the ulti-\nmate dispute\u201d). \nExhaustion questions, whether intertwined with \nthe merits or not, do not raise the same concerns as \nthose in Beacon Theatres for two interrelated reasons. \nFirst, unlike the substantive claims in Beacon Thea-\ntres, exhaustion is a threshold precondition to reach-\ning the merits. Second, unlike the concerns of collat-\neral estoppel or res judicata in Beacon Theatres, a \njudge\u2019s factual findings on exhaustion would not pre-\nclude a jury\u2019s ability to consider those same facts when \ndetermining the merits of the legal claim.  \n1. The presumption does not apply be-\ncause exhaustion is a threshold issue \nthat is logically precedent to the mer-\nits.  \nBeacon Theatres involved competing causes of ac-\ntion\u2014claims for declaratory and injunctive relief on \nthe one hand and claims for treble damages on the \nother. Under the historical equity-first order of opera-\ntions, see Liberty Oil Co., 260 U.S. at 242, the latter \nmerits claims would have been bound by the determi-\nnation of the former and thus never tried before a jury. \nThis Court held that this would violate the Seventh \nAmendment.  \nNo such scenario is present here. Unlike the \nclaims at issue in Beacon Theatres, exhaustion is a \nthreshold precondition to suit that, by its nature, \nmust be determined before the merits. Given that it is \na rule of \u201corderly\u201d procedure, Sing Tuck, 194 U.S. at \n\n42 \n \n168, \u201c[u]ntil the issue of exhaustion is resolved, a \ncourt cannot know whether it is to decide the case or \nthe prison authorities are to,\u201d Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741. \nSee also Perez v. Wis. Dep\u2019t of Corr., 182 F.3d 532, 534 \n(7th Cir. 1999) (explaining that exhaustion is \u201cde-\nsigned to prevent [a] decision on the merits\u201d). To do \notherwise would flip exhaustion on its head\u2014defer-\nence to agency authority would be bypassed and judi-\ncial efficiency lost. See McCarthy, 503 U.S. at 145; Pe-\nrez, 182 F.3d at 534 (explaining that \u201c[e]xamining the \nmerits first and then ordering a case dismissed on ex-\nhaustion grounds . . . would disregard the statutory \napproach\u201d).  \nBecause exhaustion is a threshold issue, it does \nnot have any bearing on a prisoner\u2019s jury trial right. \nIndeed, \u201c \u2018[t]he Seventh Amendment does not confer \nthe right to a trial, but only the right to have a jury \nhear the case once it is determined that the litigation \nshould proceed before a court.\u2019 \u201d Caley, 428 F.3d at \n1372 (quoting Am. Heritage Life Ins. Co., 294 F.3d at \n711); see also Sydnor v. Conseco Fin. Serv. Corp., 252 \nF.3d 302, 307 (4th Cir. 2001) (same). In contrast to \nBeacon Theatres, in which there were competing equi-\ntable and legal causes of action, exhaustion presents \na threshold precondition to suit. Legal claims that are \nsubject to trial by jury may be tried by that jury only \nafter determination of the threshold issue. Beacon \nTheatres is therefore distinguishable and does not \ncompel a different result.  \n\n43 \n \n2. The presumption does not apply be-\ncause a judge\u2019s factual findings re-\ngarding exhaustion would not pre-\nclude a jury\u2019s consideration of the \nsame facts when determining the \nmerits of the legal claim.  \nThis case differs from Beacon Theatres for a sec-\nond reason. A jury can reexamine factual determina-\ntion made by a judge regarding exhaustion when de-\nciding the merits of the claim.  \nBoth Beacon Theatres and Dairy Queen involved \ncircumstances in which the right to a jury trial on a \nlegal issue would be lost through the determination of \nan equitable issue. And Beacon Theatres itself recog-\nnized that there would be cases in which a trial court \nhas \u201cdiscretion in deciding whether the legal or equi-\ntable cause should be tried first,\u201d 359 U.S. at 510, \nkeeping in mind that this discretion \u201cmust, wherever \npossible, be exercised to preserve jury trial.\u201d Id. See \nalso Markman, 517 U.S. at 377 (asking whether the \njury must hear this question to \u201cpreserve the \u2018sub-\nstance of the common-law right of trial by jury\u2019 \u201d) \n(quoting Tull, 481 U.S. at 426) (emphasis omitted). \nHere, that right can be preserved through a jury\u2019s \nability to reexamine the fact questions common to ex-\nhaustion and the underlying legal claim at trial. As \nexplained in Pavey:  \n[A]ny finding that the judge makes, relating \nto exhaustion, that might affect the merits \nmay be reexamined by the jury if\u2014and only \nafter\u2014the prisoner overcomes the exhaustion \ndefense and the case proceeds to the merits. \n544 F.3d at 742.  \n\n44 \n \nThis approach is consistent with the \u201cflexible\u201d na-\nture of collateral estoppel. Duvall v. Att\u2019y Gen. of the \nUnited States, 436 F.3d 382, 390 (3d Cir. 2006) \n(\u201cCourts and commentators have consistently recog-\nnized that collateral estoppel was borne of equity and \nis therefore \u2018flexible,\u2019 bending to satisfy its underlying \npurpose in light of the nature of the proceedings.\u201d) (ci-\ntation omitted); United States v. Stauffer Chem. Co., \n464 U.S. 165, 176 (1984) (White, J., concurring) (ex-\nplaining that collateral estoppel \u201cis a flexible, judge-\nmade doctrine\u201d). Cf. Parklane Hosiery, 439 U.S. at 331 \n(explaining that trial courts have \u201cbroad discretion\u201d in \ndetermining \nwhen \noffensive \ncollateral \nestoppel \n\u201cshould be applied\u201d). \nPavey\u2019s pragmatic approach disposes of the pri-\nmary concern at issue in Beacon Theatres and Dairy \nQueen\u2014namely, that the \u201cright to a jury trial of legal \nissues [would] be lost through prior determination of \nequitable claims.\u201d 359 U.S. at 511 (citation omitted). \nFollowing Pavey\u2019s approach, \u201c[i]f and when the judge \ndetermines that the prisoner has properly exhausted \nhis administrative remedies, the case will proceed to \npretrial discovery, and if necessary a trial, on the mer-\nits[.]\u201d 544 F.3d at 742; see also id. at 741 (explaining \nthat \u201cin many cases the only consequence of a failure \nto exhaust is that the prisoner must go back to the \nbottom rung of the administrative ladder\u201d).4 Then, \u201cif \nthere is a jury trial, the jury will make all necessary \nfindings of fact without being bound by (or even \n \n4 This approach also allays the concerns in Fireman\u2019s Fund, \nwhich the Sixth Circuit relied on below, that \u201cthe merits of a con-\ntroversy could be summarily decided\u201d \u201cwithout the ordinary inci-\ndents of trial.\u201d 253 F.2d at 784 (citing Smithers v. Smith, 204 \nU.S. 632, 645 (1907)).  \n\n45 \n \ninformed of) any of the findings made by the district \njudge in determining that the prisoner had exhausted \nhis administrative remedies.\u201d5 Id. In short, the \u201csub-\nstance of the common-law right of trial by jury\u201d is pre-\nserved. Colgrove, 413 U.S. at 156.  \nOf course, some prisoners will be unable to refile \ntheir lawsuit after a judge\u2019s determination that they \nfailed to properly exhaust administrative remedies. \nSee Pavey, 544 F.3d at 742 (explaining that where a \njudge decides that \u201cthe failure to exhaust was the pris-\noner\u2019s fault . . . the case is over\u201d). But this is simply a \nconsequence of the exhaustion requirement function-\ning as intended. See, e.g., Woodford, 548 U.S. at 89\u2013\n92 (discussing the purposes of exhaustion); id. at 95 \n(\u201cA prisoner who does not want to participate in the \nprison grievance system will have little incentive to \ncomply with the system\u2019s procedural rules unless non-\ncompliance carries a sanction.\u201d). And again, this con-\nsequence has no bearing on the Seventh Amendment, \nwhich guarantees a jury trial only after it is deter-\nmined that the case belongs in court.  \n \n5 As recognized in Pavey, the ability of a prisoner to refile a case \nafter proper exhaustion \u201cdistinguishes the issue of exhaustion \nfrom [other] deadline lines issues that juries decide.\u201d Id. at 741. \nFor example, \u201c[a] statute of limitations defense if successfully in-\nterposed ends the litigation rather than shunting it to another \nforum.\u201d Id.; see also Messa, 652 F.3d at 309\u201310 (explaining that \nthe doctrines of exhaustion and statutes of limitations \u201cplay . . . \nimportant\u2014and distinct\u2014roles in our system of justice\u201d) (cita-\ntion omitted).  \n\n46 \n \nB. Unlike in Beacon Theatres, a judicial de-\ntermination of exhaustion would imple-\nment congressional intent.  \nEven assuming Beacon Theatres applies generally \nto threshold issues that would not implicate the jury\u2019s \nultimate determination of the merits, its presumption \nshould not apply in the PLRA exhaustion context.  \nPost-Beacon Theatres, this Court has noted the \nlimitations of its order-of-trial presumption. In \nKatchen, for example, the Court explained that \u201c[b]oth \nBeacon Theatres and Dairy Queen recognize that \nthere might be situations in which the Courts could \nproceed to resolve the equitable claims first even \nthough the results might be dispositive of the issues \ninvolved in the legal claim.\u201d 382 U.S. at 339 (emphasis \nadded). The Katchen Court addressed \u201cthe mode of \nprocedure for trying out the issue\u201d of voidable prefer-\nences against an estate in bankruptcy proceedings. \n382 U.S. at 325, 326. Recognizing the equitable juris-\ndiction of bankruptcy courts and the \u201cspecific statu-\ntory scheme contemplating the prompt trial of a dis-\nputed claim but without the intervention of a jury,\u201d \nthis Court permitted a bankruptcy court to decide the \npreference issues in an equitable proceeding notwith-\nstanding the argument that it would \u201crender unneces-\nsary a trial in a [legal] action.\u201d Id. at 336, 339. The \nCourt rejected the petitioner\u2019s reliance on Beacon The-\natres and Dairy Queen, noting that the rule of those \ncases \u201cis itself an equitable doctrine\u201d and that appli-\ncation of the rule would \u201cdismember a scheme which \nCongress has prescribed.\u201d Id. at 339; see also id. at \n339\u201340 (\u201cBoth Beacon Theatres and Dairy Queen rec-\nognize that there might be situations in which the \nCourt could proceed to resolve the equitable claim \n\n47 \n \nfirst even though the results might be dispositive of \nthe issues involved in the legal claim.\u201d); but see Gran-\nfinanciera, 492 U.S. at 58\u201359 (noting the limitations \non the scope of Congress\u2019s ability to \u201cdivest [parties] of \ntheir Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial\u201d).  \nAs in Katchen, this case involves a specific statu-\ntory scheme whose purpose would be compromised ab-\nsent prompt resolution of disputed facts by the court. \nSee Katchen, 383 U.S. at 339. Congress passed the \nPLRA \u201cto reduce the quantity and improve the quality \nof prisoner suits.\u201d Porter, 534 U.S. at 524. The \u201cinvig-\norated\u201d exhaustion requirements is the \u201ccenterpiece\u201d \nof this legislation, Woodford, 548 U.S. at 84, and it \nserves dual purposes. It allows prisons to rectify their \nown mistakes before they are \u201chaled into federal \ncourt,\u201d id. at 89, and promotes judicial efficiency by \nreducing litigation and creating an administrative \nrecord for the litigation that does occur, id. \nAllowing potentially unexhausted claims to pro-\nceed to a jury trial subverts both purposes. See also \nPart I(B)(4). This subversion is further reason why the \nprudential rule set forth in Beacon Theatres should \nnot apply to PLRA exhaustion.  \nThat an exhaustion question is intertwined with \nthe merits of a prisoner\u2019s claim does not transform ex-\nhaustion into a jury-triable issue. Exhaustion is a \nthreshold issue that is logically precedent to the mer-\nits. And Beacon Theatres\u2019 presumption would not ap-\nply where any judicial determination of overlapping \nfacts remains subject to later review by a jury in a trial \non the merits. Finally, that a judicial determination of  \n \n \n\n48 \n \nexhaustion would implement congressional intent \nserves as yet another reason why Beacon Theatres\u2019 \nprudential rule should not apply to exhaustion ques-\ntions. \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be  \nreversed.  \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nAnn M.

Because he \nalleges that their retaliation included destroying his \nprison grievances and preventing him from utilizing \nthe grievance process, the question of whether he \nfailed to exhaust available administrative remedies \nis inextricably intertwined with the core merits of \nhis claim. This is a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim for money \ndamages, so the Seventh Amendment clearly gives \nMr. Richards a right to jury trial on the merits of his \nclaims.  Nonetheless, the magistrate judge conducted \na bench trial, heard evidence from both sides, found \nas a fact that the testimony of Respondent and his \nco-plaintiffs was not credible, and recommended \ndismissal on the ground that they failed to exhaust \navailable \nprison \nremedies. \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt \naccepted that recommendation. \n \nThe Sixth Circuit correctly held that this process \nviolated \nthe \nSeventh \nAmendment, \ngiven \nthe \nsubstantial overlap between the factual disputes \nrelated to exhaustion and the actual merits of \nRichards\u2019 claims. In so doing, and as the petition \nexplains, the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision created an \nacknowledged circuit split with the Seventh Circuit\u2019s \ndecision in Pavey v. Conley, 544 F.3d 739 (7th Cir. \n2008). The en banc Ninth Circuit has also endorsed \nthe relevant holding of Pavey in Albino v. Baca, 747 \nF.3d 1162, 1171 (9th Cir. 2014) (en banc), though the \nSixth Circuit characterized the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \nlanguage as dicta. Pet. App. 14a. On the other side of \n\n2 \n \n \nthe equation, several district courts in the Second \nCircuit have like, the Sixth Circuit, disagreed with \nPavey.  \n \nNonetheless, review of this shallow split would \nbe premature. The Sixth Circuit is clearly right\u2014\nand the Seventh and Ninth Circuits clearly wrong\u2014\non the Seventh Amendment question. Indeed, there \nare strong arguments that the Seventh Amendment \ndoes not permit judicial resolution of facts related to \nexhaustion \neven \nwhen \nthose \nfacts \nare \nnot \nintertwined with the merits. When the facts are \nintertwined, it is black-letter law that judges should \ndefer to juries even as to facts (like amount-in-\ncontroversy) that also bear on subject matter \njurisdiction. Several circuits that generally permit \njudge resolution of exhaustion questions have \nreserved decision on whether a different rule might \nbe necessary when those facts are intertwined with \nthe merits. There is every reason to expect that \nthose circuits will ultimately side with the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s cogent analysis in this case and reject the \nSeventh Circuit\u2019s puzzling and illogical Pavey \ndecision. Indeed the Seventh and Ninth Circuits may \nwell reconsider the question en banc without this \nCourt\u2019s intervention. \n \nThe petition argues at length that convening a \njury to decide factual disputes bearing on exhaustion \nof remedies would defeat Congress\u2019s intent to \nstreamline \nprisoner \nlitigation \nin \nthe \nPrison \nLitigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d). It says time and \nagain that early bench trial resolution of exhaustion \nquestions is necessary to bar \u201cfrivolous claims at the \nearliest possible juncture.\u201d  Pet. at 2; see also id. at 9, \n16. But the PLRA\u2019s actual pre-screening provision, \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, notably does not provide for such \n\n3 \n \n \na procedure. The Sixth Circuit here also ruled that \nRichards\u2019 \u201cserious and detailed allegations cannot \nreasonably be considered frivolous,\u201d Pet. App. 8a, \nand observed that the defendant did \u201cnot directly \ncontest whether his alleged actions were motivated \nby Richards\u2019s protected conduct.\u201d  96 F.4th at 918\u2013\n19.  The petition challenges neither ruling.   \n \nThis Court has repeatedly rejected arguments \nlike these suggesting that the PLRA sets up \nexhaustion as some kind of special and jurisdictional \nprecondition to suit. See, e.g., Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. \n199, 216 (2007) (\u201cfailure to exhaust is an affirmative \ndefense under the PLRA\u201d); see also Woodford v. Ngo, \n548 U.S. 81, 101 (2006) (concluding that \u201cthe PLRA \nexhaustion requirement is not jurisdictional\u201d). The \nproblem of intertwined exhaustion and merits \nfactual disputes also is presented only in a subset of \nPLRA cases.  And in any event the question is not \nwhether jury resolution of disputed facts can be \nsquared with a statute\u2019s purpose, but rather whether \nthat statute\u2019s application can be squared with the \nConstitution. As this Court has repeatedly made \nclear, questions about Congress\u2019s intent must take a \nback-seat to the historic role of the jury at common \nlaw. Yet Michigan would hand Congress the keys to \nthe car and strap the Seventh Amendment to the \nroof. This Court should decline that invitation. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n4 \n \n \nI. THE \nSIXTH \nCIRCUIT\u2019S \nDECISION \nIS \n \nCLEARLY CORRECT \n \nA. \nThe \nSixth \nCircuit \nCorrectly \nRecognized That Facts Intertwined \nWith The Merits Should Always Be \nDecided By Juries  \n \nThe petition argues that a factual dispute about \nexhaustion is just a \u201cthreshold issue to determine \nwhether \na \nprisoner \nhas \nmet \na \nprocedural \nrequirement to take his or her case to a jury,\u201d and \nthat therefore the Seventh Amendment is not \nimplicated by analogy to other threshold issues like \nabstention and venue. Pet. 19. These arguments \nmirror Judge Posner\u2019s \u201cgeneralization\u201d in Pavey that \n\u201c[j]uries decide cases, not issues of judicial traffic \ncontrol.\u201d 544 F.3d at 741. But they bear little \nresemblance to an actual Seventh Amendment \nanalysis. \n \nUnder this Court\u2019s precedents, \u00a7 1983\u2014the \nfoundation of Richards\u2019s action\u2014is clearly analogous \nto causes of action that were \u201ctried at law at the time \nof the founding.\u201d Markman v. Westview Instruments, \nInc., 517 U.S. 370, 376 (1996); City of Monterey v. Del \nMonte Dunes at Monterey, Ltd., 526 U.S. 687, 718 \n(1999). So the precise Seventh Amendment question \nis \u201cwhether the particular trial decision,\u201d a factual \ndispute about exhaustion that overlaps with the \nmerits, \u201cmust fall to the jury in order to preserve the \nsubstance of the common-law right as it existed in \n1791.\u201d Markman, 517 U.S. at 376. To figure that out, \n\u201cwe look to history to determine whether the \nparticular issues, or analogous ones, were decided by \njudge or by jury in suits at common law at the time \n\n5 \n \n \nthe Seventh Amendment was adopted.\u201d Del Monte \nDunes, 526 U.S. at 718. And \u201cwhere history does not \nprovide a clear answer, we look to precedent and \nfunctional considerations.\u201d Id. \nThe Sixth Circuit rightly acknowledged that \nunder this Court\u2019s precedents \u201c\u2018many procedural \ndevices developed since 1791 that have diminished the \ncivil jury\u2019s historic domain,\u2019\u201d such as directed verdicts \nand summary judgment, \u201c\u2018have been found not to be \ninconsistent with the Seventh Amendment.\u2019\u201d Pet. App. \n16a-17a (quoting Parklane Hosiery Co., Inc. v. Shore, \n439 U.S. 322, 336 (1979)). But it then recognized the \nkey distinction between those devices and what \nhappened here: none of them \u201cpermit a judge to decide \ngenuine disputes of material fact at a preliminary \nstage of the case that would normally be reserved for \nthe jury.\u201d Pet. App. 17a. The magistrate judge\u2019s \nfactfinding in this case\u2014including explicit credibility \ndeterminations\u2014directly invaded the merits and \n\u201cstripped [Richards] of his \u2018right to a jury\u2019s resolution \nof the ultimate dispute.\u2019\u201d Pet. App. 17a (quoting \nMarkman, 517 U.S. at 377).  \nTo buttress the point, the Sixth Circuit cited its \nlongstanding holding that factual disputes about the \namount in controversy should be deferred to the jury \non the merits in diversity cases, even though that \nissue also has implications for subject matter \njurisdiction. See Pet. App. 17a-18a; Fireman\u2019s Fund \nInsurance Co v. Railway Express Agency, 253 F.2d \n780 (6th Cir. 1958). Because \u201cFireman\u2019s Fund \nrequires that certain cases be heard and determined \non the merits even when constitutionally implicated \njurisdictional disputes might procedurally terminate \nthe proceedings,\u201d the court explained, \u201cwe are all the \nmore convinced that the result should be the same \n\n6 \n \n \nwhen the lesser concern of an affirmative defense, \nsuch as the PLRA\u2019s requirement to exhaust \nadministrative remedies, implicates the merits of a \nclaim.\u201d Pet. App. 19a. After all, \u201c[u]nlike exhaustion, \nan absence of subject-matter jurisdiction implicates \na federal court\u2019s ability to even hear the case.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 19a. Fireman\u2019s Fund also explains why its \nholding is not inconsistent with the general rule that \njudges ordinarily are allowed to hear evidence and to \ndetermine facts necessary to the court\u2019s jurisdiction: \n\u201csuch hearings usually involve factual issues \npertaining only to the question of jurisdiction, not \nincluding factual issues which would be decisive of \nthe merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claim.\u201d 253 F.2d at 784. \nThe petition criticizes the Sixth Circuit\u2019s reliance \non Fireman\u2019s Fund on the ground that \u201cthe case did \nnot discuss or rely on the Seventh Amendment.\u201d Pet. \n20. That is only superficially true. Fireman\u2019s Fund \nrelied on this Court\u2019s decision in Smithers v. Smith, \n204 U.S. 632 (1907), which similarly held that a \ndispute about amount in controversy should be \ndeferred to a jury trial when that issue is intertwined \nwith the merits. And Smithers clearly does rely on \nSeventh Amendment principles, at least in part. This \nCourt explained that judicial discretion to find \njurisdictional facts \u201cobviously is not unlimited, . . . lest \nunder the guise of determining jurisdiction, the merits \nof the controversy between the parties be summarily \ndecided without the ordinary incidents of a trial, \nincluding the right to a jury.\u201d 204 U.S. at 645 \n(emphasis added). \u201cFor it must not be forgotten,\u201d this \nCourt wrote, \u201cthat where, in good faith, one has \nbrought into court a cause of action which, as stated \nby him, is clearly within its jurisdiction, he has the \nright to try its merits in the manner provided by the \n\n7 \n \n \nConstitution and law, and cannot be compelled to \nsubmit to a trial of another kind.\u201d Id. \nFireman\u2019s Fund also relied on this Court\u2019s \nopinion in Land v. Dollar, 330 U.S. 731 (1947), \nwhich considered a suit by a steamship company\u2019s \nstockholders against the U.S. Maritime Commission \nto recover stock previously given to the Commission. \nThis Court held that the district court erred in \ndeciding a jurisdictional sovereign immunity question, \nbecause \u201cthis is the type of case where the question of \njurisdiction is dependent on decision of the merits.\u201d \n330 U.S. at 735. \u201c[I]f the allegations of the petition \n[were] true, the shares of stock never were property of \nthe United States,\u201d so the district court had \n\u201cjurisdiction to determine its jurisdiction\u201d and should \ninstead have \u201cproceed[ed] to a decision on the merits.\u201d \nId. at 738\u201339. Land v. Dollar does not explicitly \ninvoke the right to jury trial, but the principles it \nrelied on are plainly intended to protect that right. \nIt is longstanding black letter law that \u201c[i]n a case \nin which there is a right to jury trial, a dismissal for \nlack of jurisdiction that improperly summarily decides \nthe substantive issues also violates the parties\u2019 \nSeventh Amendment rights.\u201d 8 Moore\u2019s Federal \nPractice \u00a7 38.34[1][c][i] (3d ed. 2009) (\u201cTrial on Merits \nRequired \nWhen \nJurisdictional \nDetermination \nDepends on Determination of Merits.\u201d).1 Factual \n                                                 \n1 See also 5C Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \n\u00a7 1350 (3d ed. 2004) (\u201cThe court may postpone a decision until \nevidence is submitted at trial if the jurisdictional issue is \nintertwined with the merits of the case.\u201d); Joshua S. Moskovitz, \nNote, The Usual Practice: Raising and Deciding Failure to \nExhaust Administrative Remedies as an Affirmative Defense \nunder the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 31 Cardozo L. Rev. 1859, \n1899 n.248 (2010) (Moskovitz) (collecting sources).  \n\n8 \n \n \nquestions bearing on both personal jurisdiction and \nvenue are also reserved for trial and submitted to the \njury when they are intertwined with the core merits of \nthe case.2 And in the related context of civil actions \npresenting both legal and equitable claims, this Court \nhas consistently held that the jury trial right cannot \n\u201cbe impaired by any blending with a claim, properly \ncognizable at law, of a demand for equitable relief in \naid of the legal action, or during its pendency.\u201d Scott v. \nNeely, 140 U.S. 106, 109\u201310 (1891); see also Ross v. \nBernhard, 396 U.S. 531, 537\u201338, 538 n.10 (1970) \n(\u201c[W]here equitable and legal claims are joined in the \nsame action, [the] right to jury trial on the legal \nclaims . . . must not be infringed.\u201d). \nThe rule that factual issues bearing on the merits \nmust always be decided by a jury has very deep roots. \nAt common law, defendants could dispute a plaintiff\u2019s \ndeclaration (i.e., complaint) by either demurrer or \nplea. John Jay McKelvey, Principles of Common-Law \nPleading \u00a7 93, at 68\u201369 (1894) (McKelvey). A \ndemurrer, like a modern-day 12(b)(6) or purely legal \n12(b)(1) motion, accepted the facts as alleged and \n\u201craise[d] a question of law for the determination of the \ncourt\u201d about the declaration\u2019s sufficiency. Benjamin J. \n                                                 \n2 See, e.g., Brown v. Slenker, 220 F.3d 411, 419 (5th Cir. 2000) \n(\u201c[Personal j]urisdiction remains intertwined with the merits, and \non remand both must be decided at a new trial, based on valid \njury findings.\u201d); Kierulff Assocs. v. Luria Bros. & Co., 240 F. Supp. \n640, 642 (S.D.N.Y. 1965) (\u201cWhere venue and the merits of an \naction are intertwined, it is often better to wait until trial where a \nfull presentation of the issue can be made, rather than rule \npreliminarily on a motion.\u201d); Fastener Corp. v. Spotnails, Inc., 291 \nF. Supp. 974, 976 (N.D. Ill. 1968) (\u201c[T]he venue question merge[d] \nwith the issue of infringement on the merits . . . .\u201d).  \n\n9 \n \n \nShipman, Handbook of Common-Law Pleading \u00a7\u00a7 8\u20139, \nat 28 (3d ed. 1923) (Shipman).  \nAs an alternative to the demurrer, there were \nvarious types of pleas. The plea in traverse denied the \ndeclaration\u2019s factual allegations and triggered a jury \ntrial. \u201cWhere an allegation is traversed, or denied, it is \nevident that a question is at once raised between the \nparties; and it is a question of fact . . . .\u201d Shipman \n\u00a7 167, at 302; see also Richard Ross Perry, Common-\nLaw Pleading: Its History and Principles 179\u201380 \n(1897) (Perry). \u201c[T]he tender and acceptance of an \nissue of fact close[d] all pleading in the action, as there \n[was] then nothing left but a trial, which [disposed] of \nthe action on its merits.\u201d Shipman \u00a7 15, at 32\u201333.  \nThe common law permitted various other types of \npleas\u2014such as a plea in abatement or plea in bar\u2014\nthat might raise legal or factual issues collateral to \nthe merits. But critically, if any such plea actually \ncontradicted the factual allegations of the plaintiff\u2019s \ndeclaration, the common law would have regarded it \nas a traverse and proceeded immediately to a trial by \njury. \u201cThe word traverse . . . is synonymous with the \nword denial. Where the defendant intends to rely for \nhis defense upon the fact that the allegations \ncontained in the declaration as to the subject matter of \nthe action are untrue, he must put in the plea known \nas a traverse.\u201d McKelvey \u00a7 185, at 118; see also Perry, \nat 275. Therefore in a case (like this one) where the \nfacts relevant to a threshold defect were intertwined \nwith the merits, it would not even have been possible \nto frame the issue for a purely judicial decision at \ncommon law. \nThe petition argues that a bench trial before a \nmagistrate judge gave Mr. Richards many of the other \nimportant protections of a trial, such as a right to \n\n10 \n \n \npresent \nevidence \nand \ncross \nexamine \nopposing \nwitnesses. Pet. 20-21. No doubt those rights are \nimportant. But the right to trial by jury in civil cases \nis separately and specially protected by the Seventh \nAmendment. This Court recently recognized that \n\u201cthe right to trial by jury is \u2018of such importance and \noccupies so firm a place in our history and \njurisprudence that any seeming curtailment of the \nright has always been and \u2018should be scrutinized \nwith the utmost case.\u2019\u201d SEC v. Jarkesy, Slip Op. at 7 \n(2024) (quoting Dimick v. Schiedt, 293 U.S. 474, 486 \n(1935)). And that is by no means a newfound \nsentiment: Justice Story once explained that the civil \njury trial right is \u201cjustly dear to the American \npeople. It has always been an object of deep interest \nand solicitude, and every encroachment upon it has \nbeen watched with great jealousy.\u201d Parsons v. \nBedford, Breedlove & Robeson, 28 U.S. 433, 466 \n(1830). The Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision is entirely \nconsistent with that tradition. \n \n \nB. \nThe Seventh Circuit\u2019s Decision In \n \nPavey Makes No Sense  \nThe Seventh and Ninth Circuit decisions, by \ncontrast, do not genuinely grapple with the Seventh \nAmendment problem and clearly get the answer \nwrong.  \nJudge Posner\u2019s opinion in Pavey takes for \ngranted that questions of subject matter jurisdiction \n\u201coften . . . turn[] on factual issues that may be \ngenuinely debatable, but even if so the issues are \nresolved by the judge,\u201d without recognizing that an \nopposite rule applies when jurisdictional facts are \nintertwined with the merits. Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741. \nThe Pavey opinion then leaps from the observation \n\n11 \n \n \nthat judges sometimes are permitted to decide \nquestions of fact relevant to preliminary threshold \nissues to an entirely unwarranted \u201cgeneralization\u201d \nthat juries do not decide any questions that can be \ncharacterized as matters of \u201cjudicial traffic control.\u201d \nId.  \nIn reaching that conclusion, Pavey wrongly \ncharacterizes exhaustion as just an issue of \u201cjudicial \ntraffic control\u201d on the naked assertion that \u201cin many \ncases\u201d exhaustion is simply a question of the choice \nof forum because \u201cthe only consequence of a failure \nto exhaust is that the prisoner must go back to the \nbottom rung of the administrative ladder.\u201d Id. \u201cThat \ndistinguishes the issue of exhaustion from deadline \nissues that juries decide,\u201d the Seventh Circuit \nreasoned, because \u201c[a] statute of limitations defense \nif successfully interposed ends the litigation rather \nthan shunting it to another forum.\u201d The Seventh \nCircuit acknowledged, however, that in that actual \ncase the defendant \u201cwould no longer have any \nadministrative remedies\u201d if the exhaustion issue was \nresolved against him, so the issue was entirely \ndispositive of the merits. Id. Surely this Court \nunderstands that that will almost always be true in \nPLRA cases. Prisons have grievance and appeal \nprocesses with extremely tight filing windows\u2014\nmeasured in days. By the time an exhaustion issue \nis raised in federal court, those deadlines will \ngenerally be years in the past and will make it \nimpossible for the plaintiff to go back and seek \nfurther exhaustion. See Alison M. Mikkor, Correcting \nfor Bias and Blind Spots in PLRA Exhaustion Law, \n21 George Mason L. Rev. 573, 584 (2014) (\u201cIn the \nlast few years, many corrections departments have \nalso reduced the amount of time within which a \n\n12 \n \n \nprisoner must file her initial grievance and any \nsubsequent appeals.  In the light of the deference \nshown to [these internal] rules in the PLRA \nexhaustion analysis, this reduction means that for \nprisoners in some systems there is effectively only a \ntwo- or three-day statute of limitations on their \nconstitutional claims.\u201d) (footnotes omitted).   \nFinally, the Seventh Circuit reasoned that, \u201c[b]y \nanalogy to the cases that require that claims at law \nbe decided before equitable claims when both types \nof claim are presented,\u201d a jury later hearing the case \non the merits would not be bound by any exhaustion \nfindings the judge made. Id. at 742. But as the Sixth \nCircuit correctly explained, that line of reasoning \n\u201crings hollow\u201d because \u201cif the prisoner\u2019s case is \ndismissed for failure to exhaust his or her \nadministrative remedies\u201d then \u201ca jury would never \nbe assembled to resolve the factual disputes\u201d on the \nmerits. Pet. App. 15a. \nIn Albino v. Baca, the en banc Ninth Circuit \nappeared to embrace Pavey, with the court noting \nthat \u201c[w]e agree with the Seventh Circuit that, if a \nfactual finding on a disputed question is relevant \nboth to exhaustion and to the merits, a judge\u2019s \nfinding made in the course of deciding exhaustion is \nnot binding on a jury deciding the merits of the suit.\u201d \n747 F.3d\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Rev. 1859 (2010) ...................... 7, 15, 16 \n \nRichard Ross Perry, Common-Law Pleading: Its \nHistory and Principles (1897) ............................... 9, 17 \n \n\n1 \n \n \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE WRIT \n \n \nRespondent Kyle Brandon Richards filed this \ncivil rights lawsuit alleging, among other things, \nthat \nMichigan \ncorrectional \nofficers \nsexually \nassaulted him and retaliated against him for \nexercising his First Amendment rights. Because he \nalleges that their retaliation included destroying his \nprison grievances and preventing him from utilizing \nthe grievance process, the question of whether he \nfailed to exhaust available administrative remedies \nis inextricably intertwined with the core merits of \nhis claim. This is a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim for money \ndamages, so the Seventh Amendment clearly gives \nMr. Richards a right to jury trial on the merits of his \nclaims.  Nonetheless, the magistrate judge conducted \na bench trial, heard evidence from both sides, found \nas a fact that the testimony of Respondent and his \nco-plaintiffs was not credible, and recommended \ndismissal on the ground that they failed to exhaust \navailable \nprison \nremedies. \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt \naccepted that recommendation. \n \nThe Sixth Circuit correctly held that this process \nviolated \nthe \nSeventh \nAmendment, \ngiven \nthe \nsubstantial overlap between the factual disputes \nrelated to exhaustion and the actual merits of \nRichards\u2019 claims. In so doing, and as the petition \nexplains, the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision created an \nacknowledged circuit split with the Seventh Circuit\u2019s \ndecision in Pavey v. Conley, 544 F.3d 739 (7th Cir. \n2008). The en banc Ninth Circuit has also endorsed \nthe relevant holding of Pavey in Albino v. Baca, 747 \nF.3d 1162, 1171 (9th Cir. 2014) (en banc), though the \nSixth Circuit characterized the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \nlanguage as dicta. Pet. App. 14a. On the other side of \n\n2 \n \n \nthe equation, several district courts in the Second \nCircuit have like, the Sixth Circuit, disagreed with \nPavey.  \n \nNonetheless, review of this shallow split would \nbe premature. The Sixth Circuit is clearly right\u2014\nand the Seventh and Ninth Circuits clearly wrong\u2014\non the Seventh Amendment question. Indeed, there \nare strong arguments that the Seventh Amendment \ndoes not permit judicial resolution of facts related to \nexhaustion \neven \nwhen \nthose \nfacts \nare \nnot \nintertwined with the merits. When the facts are \nintertwined, it is black-letter law that judges should \ndefer to juries even as to facts (like amount-in-\ncontroversy) that also bear on subject matter \njurisdiction. Several circuits that generally permit \njudge resolution of exhaustion questions have \nreserved decision on whether a different rule might \nbe necessary when those facts are intertwined with \nthe merits. There is every reason to expect that \nthose circuits will ultimately side with the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s cogent analysis in this case and reject the \nSeventh Circuit\u2019s puzzling and illogical Pavey \ndecision. Indeed the Seventh and Ninth Circuits may \nwell reconsider the question en banc without this \nCourt\u2019s intervention. \n \nThe petition argues at length that convening a \njury to decide factual disputes bearing on exhaustion \nof remedies would defeat Congress\u2019s intent to \nstreamline \nprisoner \nlitigation \nin \nthe \nPrison \nLitigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d). It says time and \nagain that early bench trial resolution of exhaustion \nquestions is necessary to bar \u201cfrivolous claims at the \nearliest possible juncture.\u201d  Pet. at 2; see also id. at 9, \n16. But the PLRA\u2019s actual pre-screening provision, \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, notably does not provide for such \n\n3 \n \n \na procedure. The Sixth Circuit here also ruled that \nRichards\u2019 \u201cserious and detailed allegations cannot \nreasonably be considered frivolous,\u201d Pet. App. 8a, \nand observed that the defendant did \u201cnot directly \ncontest whether his alleged actions were motivated \nby Richards\u2019s protected conduct.\u201d  96 F.4th at 918\u2013\n19.  The petition challenges neither ruling.   \n \nThis Court has repeatedly rejected arguments \nlike these suggesting that the PLRA sets up \nexhaustion as some kind of special and jurisdictional \nprecondition to suit. See, e.g., Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. \n199, 216 (2007) (\u201cfailure to exhaust is an affirmative \ndefense under the PLRA\u201d); see also Woodford v. Ngo, \n548 U.S. 81, 101 (2006) (concluding that \u201cthe PLRA \nexhaustion requirement is not jurisdictional\u201d). The \nproblem of intertwined exhaustion and merits \nfactual disputes also is presented only in a subset of \nPLRA cases.  And in any event the question is not \nwhether jury resolution of disputed facts can be \nsquared with a statute\u2019s purpose, but rather whether \nthat statute\u2019s application can be squared with the \nConstitution. As this Court has repeatedly made \nclear, questions about Congress\u2019s intent must take a \nback-seat to the historic role of the jury at common \nlaw. Yet Michigan would hand Congress the keys to \nthe car and strap the Seventh Amendment to the \nroof. This Court should decline that invitation. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n4 \n \n \nI. THE \nSIXTH \nCIRCUIT\u2019S \nDECISION \nIS \n \nCLEARLY CORRECT \n \nA. \nThe \nSixth \nCircuit \nCorrectly \nRecognized That Facts Intertwined \nWith The Merits Should Always Be \nDecided By Juries  \n \nThe petition argues that a factual dispute about \nexhaustion is just a \u201cthreshold issue to determine \nwhether \na \nprisoner \nhas \nmet \na \nprocedural \nrequirement to take his or her case to a jury,\u201d and \nthat therefore the Seventh Amendment is not \nimplicated by analogy to other threshold issues like \nabstention and venue. Pet. 19. These arguments \nmirror Judge Posner\u2019s \u201cgeneralization\u201d in Pavey that \n\u201c[j]uries decide cases, not issues of judicial traffic \ncontrol.\u201d 544 F.3d at 741. But they bear little \nresemblance to an actual Seventh Amendment \nanalysis. \n \nUnder this Court\u2019s precedents, \u00a7 1983\u2014the \nfoundation of Richards\u2019s action\u2014is clearly analogous \nto causes of action that were \u201ctried at law at the time \nof the founding.\u201d Markman v. Westview Instruments, \nInc., 517 U.S. 370, 376 (1996); City of Monterey v. Del \nMonte Dunes at Monterey, Ltd., 526 U.S. 687, 718 \n(1999). So the precise Seventh Amendment question \nis \u201cwhether the particular trial decision,\u201d a factual \ndispute about exhaustion that overlaps with the \nmerits, \u201cmust fall to the jury in order to preserve the \nsubstance of the common-law right as it existed in \n1791.\u201d Markman, 517 U.S. at 376. To figure that out, \n\u201cwe look to history to determine whether the \nparticular issues, or analogous ones, were decided by \njudge or by jury in suits at common law at the time \n\n5 \n \n \nthe Seventh Amendment was adopted.\u201d Del Monte \nDunes, 526 U.S. at 718. And \u201cwhere history does not \nprovide a clear answer, we look to precedent and \nfunctional considerations.\u201d Id. \nThe Sixth Circuit rightly acknowledged that \nunder this Court\u2019s precedents \u201c\u2018many procedural \ndevices developed since 1791 that have diminished the \ncivil jury\u2019s historic domain,\u2019\u201d such as directed verdicts \nand summary judgment, \u201c\u2018have been found not to be \ninconsistent with the Seventh Amendment.\u2019\u201d Pet. App. \n16a-17a (quoting Parklane Hosiery Co., Inc. v. Shore, \n439 U.S. 322, 336 (1979)). But it then recognized the \nkey distinction between those devices and what \nhappened here: none of them \u201cpermit a judge to decide \ngenuine disputes of material fact at a preliminary \nstage of the case that would normally be reserved for \nthe jury.\u201d Pet. App. 17a. The magistrate judge\u2019s \nfactfinding in this case\u2014including explicit credibility \ndeterminations\u2014directly invaded the merits and \n\u201cstripped [Richards] of his \u2018right to a jury\u2019s resolution \nof the ultimate dispute.\u2019\u201d Pet. App. 17a (quoting \nMarkman, 517 U.S. at 377).  \nTo buttress the point, the Sixth Circuit cited its \nlongstanding holding that factual disputes about the \namount in controversy should be deferred to the jury \non the merits in diversity cases, even though that \nissue also has implications for subject matter \njurisdiction. See Pet. App. 17a-18a; Fireman\u2019s Fund \nInsurance Co v. Railway Express Agency, 253 F.2d \n780 (6th Cir. 1958). Because \u201cFireman\u2019s Fund \nrequires that certain cases be heard and determined \non the merits even when constitutionally implicated \njurisdictional disputes might procedurally terminate \nthe proceedings,\u201d the court explained, \u201cwe are all the \nmore convinced that the result should be the same \n\n6 \n \n \nwhen the lesser concern of an affirmative defense, \nsuch as the PLRA\u2019s requirement to exhaust \nadministrative remedies, implicates the merits of a \nclaim.\u201d Pet. App. 19a. After all, \u201c[u]nlike exhaustion, \nan absence of subject-matter jurisdiction implicates \na federal court\u2019s ability to even hear the case.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 19a. Fireman\u2019s Fund also explains why its \nholding is not inconsistent with the general rule that \njudges ordinarily are allowed to hear evidence and to \ndetermine facts necessary to the court\u2019s jurisdiction: \n\u201csuch hearings usually involve factual issues \npertaining only to the question of jurisdiction, not \nincluding factual issues which would be decisive of \nthe merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claim.\u201d 253 F.2d at 784. \nThe petition criticizes the Sixth Circuit\u2019s reliance \non Fireman\u2019s Fund on the ground that \u201cthe case did \nnot discuss or rely on the Seventh Amendment.\u201d Pet. \n20. That is only superficially true. Fireman\u2019s Fund \nrelied on this Court\u2019s decision in Smithers v. Smith, \n204 U.S. 632 (1907), which similarly held that a \ndispute about amount in controversy should be \ndeferred to a jury trial when that issue is intertwined \nwith the merits. And Smithers clearly does rely on \nSeventh Amendment principles, at least in part. This \nCourt explained that judicial discretion to find \njurisdictional facts \u201cobviously is not unlimited, . . . lest \nunder the guise of determining jurisdiction, the merits \nof the controversy between the parties be summarily \ndecided without the ordinary incidents of a trial, \nincluding the right to a jury.\u201d 204 U.S. at 645 \n(emphasis added). \u201cFor it must not be forgotten,\u201d this \nCourt wrote, \u201cthat where, in good faith, one has \nbrought into court a cause of action which, as stated \nby him, is clearly within its jurisdiction, he has the \nright to try its merits in the manner provided by the \n\n7 \n \n \nConstitution and law, and cannot be compelled to \nsubmit to a trial of another kind.\u201d Id. \nFireman\u2019s Fund also relied on this Court\u2019s \nopinion in Land v. Dollar, 330 U.S. 731 (1947), \nwhich considered a suit by a steamship company\u2019s \nstockholders against the U.S. Maritime Commission \nto recover stock previously given to the Commission. \nThis Court held that the district court erred in \ndeciding a jurisdictional sovereign immunity question, \nbecause \u201cthis is the type of case where the question of \njurisdiction is dependent on decision of the merits.\u201d \n330 U.S. at 735. \u201c[I]f the allegations of the petition \n[were] true, the shares of stock never were property of \nthe United States,\u201d so the district court had \n\u201cjurisdiction to determine its jurisdiction\u201d and should \ninstead have \u201cproceed[ed] to a decision on the merits.\u201d \nId. at 738\u201339. Land v. Dollar does not explicitly \ninvoke the right to jury trial, but the principles it \nrelied on are plainly intended to protect that right. \nIt is longstanding black letter law that \u201c[i]n a case \nin which there is a right to jury trial, a dismissal for \nlack of jurisdiction that improperly summarily decides \nthe substantive issues also violates the parties\u2019 \nSeventh Amendment rights.\u201d 8 Moore\u2019s Federal \nPractice \u00a7 38.34[1][c][i] (3d ed. 2009) (\u201cTrial on Merits \nRequired \nWhen \nJurisdictional \nDetermination \nDepends on Determination of Merits.\u201d).1 Factual \n                                                 \n1 See also 5C Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \n\u00a7 1350 (3d ed. 2004) (\u201cThe court may postpone a decision until \nevidence is submitted at trial if the jurisdictional issue is \nintertwined with the merits of the case.\u201d); Joshua S. Moskovitz, \nNote, The Usual Practice: Raising and Deciding Failure to \nExhaust Administrative Remedies as an Affirmative Defense \nunder the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 31 Cardozo L. Rev. 1859, \n1899 n.248 (2010) (Moskovitz) (collecting sources).  \n\n8 \n \n \nquestions bearing on both personal jurisdiction and \nvenue are also reserved for trial and submitted to the \njury when they are intertwined with the core merits of \nthe case.2 And in the related context of civil actions \npresenting both legal and equitable claims, this Court \nhas consistently held that the jury trial right cannot \n\u201cbe impaired by any blending with a claim, properly \ncognizable at law, of a demand for equitable relief in \naid of the legal action, or during its pendency.\u201d Scott v. \nNeely, 140 U.S. 106, 109\u201310 (1891); see also Ross v. \nBernhard, 396 U.S. 531, 537\u201338, 538 n.10 (1970) \n(\u201c[W]here equitable and legal claims are joined in the \nsame action, [the] right to jury trial on the legal \nclaims . . . must not be infringed.\u201d). \nThe rule that factual issues bearing on the merits \nmust always be decided by a jury has very deep roots. \nAt common law, defendants could dispute a plaintiff\u2019s \ndeclaration (i.e., complaint) by either demurrer or \nplea. John Jay McKelvey, Principles of Common-Law \nPleading \u00a7 93, at 68\u201369 (1894) (McKelvey). A \ndemurrer, like a modern-day 12(b)(6) or purely legal \n12(b)(1) motion, accepted the facts as alleged and \n\u201craise[d] a question of law for the determination of the \ncourt\u201d about the declaration\u2019s sufficiency. Benjamin J. \n                                                 \n2 See, e.g., Brown v. Slenker, 220 F.3d 411, 419 (5th Cir. 2000) \n(\u201c[Personal j]urisdiction remains intertwined with the merits, and \non remand both must be decided at a new trial, based on valid \njury findings.\u201d); Kierulff Assocs. v. Luria Bros. & Co., 240 F. Supp. \n640, 642 (S.D.N.Y. 1965) (\u201cWhere venue and the merits of an \naction are intertwined, it is often better to wait until trial where a \nfull presentation of the issue can be made, rather than rule \npreliminarily on a motion.\u201d); Fastener Corp. v. Spotnails, Inc., 291 \nF. Supp. 974, 976 (N.D. Ill. 1968) (\u201c[T]he venue question merge[d] \nwith the issue of infringement on the merits . . . .\u201d).  \n\n9 \n \n \nShipman, Handbook of Common-Law Pleading \u00a7\u00a7 8\u20139, \nat 28 (3d ed. 1923) (Shipman).  \nAs an alternative to the demurrer, there were \nvarious types of pleas. The plea in traverse denied the \ndeclaration\u2019s factual allegations and triggered a jury \ntrial. \u201cWhere an allegation is traversed, or denied, it is \nevident that a question is at once raised between the \nparties; and it is a question of fact . . . .\u201d Shipman \n\u00a7 167, at 302; see also Richard Ross Perry, Common-\nLaw Pleading: Its History and Principles 179\u201380 \n(1897) (Perry). \u201c[T]he tender and acceptance of an \nissue of fact close[d] all pleading in the action, as there \n[was] then nothing left but a trial, which [disposed] of \nthe action on its merits.\u201d Shipman \u00a7 15, at 32\u201333.  \nThe common law permitted various other types of \npleas\u2014such as a plea in abatement or plea in bar\u2014\nthat might raise legal or factual issues collateral to \nthe merits. But critically, if any such plea actually \ncontradicted the factual allegations of the plaintiff\u2019s \ndeclaration, the common law would have regarded it \nas a traverse and proceeded immediately to a trial by \njury. \u201cThe word traverse . . . is synonymous with the \nword denial. Where the defendant intends to rely for \nhis defense upon the fact that the allegations \ncontained in the declaration as to the subject matter of \nthe action are untrue, he must put in the plea known \nas a traverse.\u201d McKelvey \u00a7 185, at 118; see also Perry, \nat 275. Therefore in a case (like this one) where the \nfacts relevant to a threshold defect were intertwined \nwith the merits, it would not even have been possible \nto frame the issue for a purely judicial decision at \ncommon law. \nThe petition argues that a bench trial before a \nmagistrate judge gave Mr. Richards many of the other \nimportant protections of a trial, such as a right to \n\n10 \n \n \npresent \nevidence \nand \ncross \nexamine \nopposing \nwitnesses. Pet. 20-21. No doubt those rights are \nimportant. But the right to trial by jury in civil cases \nis separately and specially protected by the Seventh \nAmendment. This Court recently recognized that \n\u201cthe right to trial by jury is \u2018of such importance and \noccupies so firm a place in our history and \njurisprudence that any seeming curtailment of the \nright has always been and \u2018should be scrutinized \nwith the utmost case.\u2019\u201d SEC v. Jarkesy, Slip Op. at 7 \n(2024) (quoting Dimick v. Schiedt, 293 U.S. 474, 486 \n(1935)). And that is by no means a newfound \nsentiment: Justice Story once explained that the civil \njury trial right is \u201cjustly dear to the American \npeople. It has always been an object of deep interest \nand solicitude, and every encroachment upon it has \nbeen watched with great jealousy.\u201d Parsons v. \nBedford, Breedlove & Robeson, 28 U.S. 433, 466 \n(1830). The Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision is entirely \nconsistent with that tradition. \n \n \nB. \nThe Seventh Circuit\u2019s Decision In \n \nPavey Makes No Sense  \nThe Seventh and Ninth Circuit decisions, by \ncontrast, do not genuinely grapple with the Seventh \nAmendment problem and clearly get the answer \nwrong.  \nJudge Posner\u2019s opinion in Pavey takes for \ngranted that questions of subject matter jurisdiction \n\u201coften . . . turn[] on factual issues that may be \ngenuinely debatable, but even if so the issues are \nresolved by the judge,\u201d without recognizing that an \nopposite rule applies when jurisdictional facts are \nintertwined with the merits. Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741. \nThe Pavey opinion then leaps from the observation \n\n11 \n \n \nthat judges sometimes are permitted to decide \nquestions of fact relevant to preliminary threshold \nissues to an entirely unwarranted \u201cgeneralization\u201d \nthat juries do not decide any questions that can be \ncharacterized as matters of \u201cjudicial traffic control.\u201d \nId.  \nIn reaching that conclusion, Pavey wrongly \ncharacterizes exhaustion as just an issue of \u201cjudicial \ntraffic control\u201d on the naked assertion that \u201cin many \ncases\u201d exhaustion is simply a question of the choice \nof forum because \u201cthe only consequence of a failure \nto exhaust is that the prisoner must go back to the \nbottom rung of the administrative ladder.\u201d Id. \u201cThat \ndistinguishes the issue of exhaustion from deadline \nissues that juries decide,\u201d the Seventh Circuit \nreasoned, because \u201c[a] statute of limitations defense \nif successfully interposed ends the litigation rather \nthan shunting it to another forum.\u201d The Seventh \nCircuit acknowledged, however, that in that actual \ncase the defendant \u201cwould no longer have any \nadministrative remedies\u201d if the exhaustion issue was \nresolved against him, so the issue was entirely \ndispositive of the merits. Id. Surely this Court \nunderstands that that will almost always be true in \nPLRA cases. Prisons have grievance and appeal \nprocesses with extremely tight filing windows\u2014\nmeasured in days. By the time an exhaustion issue \nis raised in federal court, those deadlines will \ngenerally be years in the past and will make it \nimpossible for the plaintiff to go back and seek \nfurther exhaustion. See Alison M. Mikkor, Correcting \nfor Bias and Blind Spots in PLRA Exhaustion Law, \n21 George Mason L. Rev. 573, 584 (2014) (\u201cIn the \nlast few years, many corrections departments have \nalso reduced the amount of time within which a \n\n12 \n \n \nprisoner must file her initial grievance and any \nsubsequent appeals.  In the light of the deference \nshown to [these internal] rules in the PLRA \nexhaustion analysis, this reduction means that for \nprisoners in some systems there is effectively only a \ntwo- or three-day statute of limitations on their \nconstitutional claims.\u201d) (footnotes omitted).   \nFinally, the Seventh Circuit reasoned that, \u201c[b]y \nanalogy to the cases that require that claims at law \nbe decided before equitable claims when both types \nof claim are presented,\u201d a jury later hearing the case \non the merits would not be bound by any exhaustion \nfindings the judge made. Id. at 742. But as the Sixth \nCircuit correctly explained, that line of reasoning \n\u201crings hollow\u201d because \u201cif the prisoner\u2019s case is \ndismissed for failure to exhaust his or her \nadministrative remedies\u201d then \u201ca jury would never \nbe assembled to resolve the factual disputes\u201d on the \nmerits. Pet. App. 15a. \nIn Albino v. Baca, the en banc Ninth Circuit \nappeared to embrace Pavey, with the court noting \nthat \u201c[w]e agree with the Seventh Circuit that, if a \nfactual finding on a disputed question is relevant \nboth to exhaustion and to the merits, a judge\u2019s \nfinding made in the course of deciding exhaustion is \nnot binding on a jury deciding the merits of the suit.\u201d \n747 F.3d at 1171. But the claims at issue in Albino \ndid not actually implicate the underlying merits, and \nelsewhere in its opinion the Ninth Circuit used less \ndefinitive language:  \u201cExhaustion should be decided, \nif feasible, before reaching the merits of a prisoner's \nclaim.\u201d  Id. (emphasis added); see also id. (\u201cWe \nreiterate that, if feasible, disputed factual questions \nrelevant to exhaustion should be decided at the very \nbeginning of the litigation.\u201d). Now that the Sixth \n\n13 \n \n \nCircuit has explained the flaws in the Seventh \nCircuit\u2019s reasoning it seems unlikely that other \ncircuits will follow along. Indeed, there is reason to \nhope that the Seventh and Ninth Circuits will \nreconsider their position en banc without a need for \nthis Court\u2019s intervention.  \nThis \nCourt \nalso \nmay \nbenefit \nfrom \nmore \npercolation. Among the courts of appeals, only the \nSixth and Seventh Circuits have addressed the issue \npresented head-on. Several district courts in the \nSecond Circuit have parted ways with Pavey. Other \ncircuits have identified the problem as well and will \nalmost certainly in due course wrestle with it more \nfully. See Small v. Camden County, 728 F.3d 265, \n270 (3d Cir. 2013) (\u201c[T]he Seventh Amendment is not \nimplicated as long as the facts are not bound up with \nthe merits of the underlying dispute.\u201d); Messa v. \nGoord, 652 F.3d 305, 309 (2d Cir. 2011) (\u201c[T]he \nfactual disputes relating to exhaustion are not \nintertwined with the merits . . . .\u201d); Dillon v. Rogers, \n596 F.3d 260, 272 n.2 (5th Cir. 2010) (\u201cWe do not \ndetermine today who should serve as factfinder \nwhen facts concerning exhaustion also go to the \nmerits of a prisoner\u2019s claim.\u201d). And, given the \nfavorable decision in the Sixth Circuit, prisoners will \nbe more likely to raise the issue going forward. \n \nC. \nExhaustion \nFacts \nShould \nBe \nDecided By Juries Even When They \nAre Not Intertwined With The \nMerits \n \nThe Sixth Circuit decided this case against the \nbackdrop of its own precedent holding that facts \nrelated to exhaustion can be resolved by judges when \n\n14 \n \n \nthey are not intertwined with the merits. That \nassumption is widely shared by the lower courts. \nAlthough it is not necessary to reach the issue in this \ncase, the Court should understand that that \nassumption is probably wrong. The reason goes back \nto the issue the Seventh Circuit failed to wrestle \nwith in Pavey: that a finding of non-exhaustion in \nthe PLRA context will almost always bar the claim \nforever. \nRecall that at common law a defendant who \ncould not or chose not to demur could either file a \ntraverse or a plea. There were a variety of pleas, but \nthe most common were \u201cpleas in abatement\u201d and \n\u201cpleas in bar.\u201d The plea in abatement was one of the \n\u201cdilatory pleas,\u201d which raised a class of common law \ndefenses that merely \u201cdelay[ed] the plaintiff\u2019s action \ninstead of dealing with the merits of his claim.\u201d \nGeorge L. Clark, Common Law Pleading \u00a7 59, at 131 \n(1931) (Clark); McKelvey \u00a7 132, at 93 (\u201cJudgment \nupon the dilatory plea was not final, . . . it did not \ndetermine the case upon the merits.\u201d).3 A plea in \nabatement, if successful, \u201cdispose[d] of the particular \nsuit\u201d but allowed the plaintiff to \u201ccommence anew \nupon the same cause of action in the same court\u201d so \nlong as the plaintiff avoided the mistake that caused \nthe original abating. McKelvey \u00a7 131, at 92. Typically, \na plea in abatement related to the parties\u2019 identities, a \nmisnomer in the declaration of facts, or a defect in the \n                                                 \n3 The other dilatory pleas were pleas to the jurisdiction and pleas \nin suspension of the action. Clark \u00a7 59, at 132. Pleas to the \njurisdiction attacked a court\u2019s subject matter or personal \njurisdiction, disposing of the case entirely before that court if \nsuccessful. McKelvey \u00a7\u00a7 131, 134, at 92, 95. Pleas in suspension of \nthe action sought to identify the plaintiff\u2019s temporary incapacity \nto bring suit. Id. \u00a7 131, at 92; Clark \u00a7 60, at 134; Shipman \u00a7 230, \nat 400. \n\n15 \n \n \nplaintiff\u2019s writ. Id. \u00a7\u00a7 134\u2013135, at 95; Moskovitz, at \n1885. Defects in the plaintiff\u2019s writ included \u201cwrong \nvenue,\u201d that the \u201caction was brought prematurely,\u201d \nthat \u201cthe same claim was pending in another court,\u201d \nthat \u201cthe parties were misnamed,\u201d or that \u201ca \nnecessary party was not joined or . . . was misjoined.\u201d \nMoskovitz, at 1885.  \nMany lower courts have broadly analogized \nexhaustion of administrative remedies to the old \nplea in abatement, and held that there is no Seventh \nAmendment right to jury factfinding because \nsupposedly factual disputes relevant to a plea in \nabatement were resolved by judges. See, e.g., Bryant \nv. Rich, 530 F.3d 1368, 1374 (11th Cir. 2008) \n(\u201cExhaustion of administrative remedies is a matter \nin abatement, and ordinarily does not deal with the \nmerits.\u201d (cleaned up) (quoting 5C Wright & Miller \n\u00a7 1360, at 78 n.15)); Albino, 747 F.3d at 1168. That \nassumption is actually disputed by scholars.4 \nRegardless, the analogy is wrong. The dilatory pleas \n(including abatement) \u201cdid not determine the case \nupon the merits.\u201d McKelvey \u00a7 132, at 93. A plea in \nabatement merely \u201cdelay[ed] the plaintiff\u2019s action \ninstead of dealing with the merits of his claim.\u201d Clark \n\u00a7 59, at 131. By definition, therefore, a plea in \nabatement could not present an argument that the \n                                                 \n4 Pleas in abatement typically tendered an issue of law properly \n\u201celiminated on demurrer\u201d by the judge. A.C. Umbreit, Outline \nof the Law of Common Law Pleading, 4 Marq. L. Rev. 130, 133 \n(1920). But if the plaintiff did not demur, \u201c[t]here is extensive \nhistorical support that a factual dispute on a matter in \nabatement \n[could \nalso \nbe] \ndecided \nby \nthe \njury . . . as \ndocumented in civil cases, in criminal cases, and in numerous \ntreatises.\u201d Moskovitz, at 1896 & nn.234\u201336 (collecting sources \nsupporting jury resolution of fact disputes posed by various \ndilatory pleas). \n\n16 \n \n \nplaintiff\u2019s claim was permanently barred. Matters in \nabatement \u201ccould only go so far as to defeat the \npresent action, and not to demonstrate that the \nplaintiff was permanently disabled from bringing the \nclaim.\u201d Moskovitz, at 1886. Any plea in abatement \nbased on a prematurity defect necessarily alleged that \nthe action was curably premature. See, e.g., Shipman \n\u00a7 225, at 390 n.18 (citing Grand Lodge Bhd. of R.R. \nTrainmen v. Randolph, 57 N.E. 882 (1900), as an \nexample of a plea in abatement alleging \u201cfailure to \nexhaust remedies provided in [a] contract\u201d). Again, \nhowever, in most PLRA cases the very short prison \ngrievance timelines will have expired long before suit \nso a finding of non-exhaustion will permanently bar \nthe claim. \nIn common law terms, an affirmative defense that \nwould permanently end the litigation would have been \nraised by a \u201cplea in bar,\u201d and specifically a variant \ncalled a plea \u201cin discharge.\u201d Pleas in bar could be pled \nnegatively, as a traverse denying the factual \nallegations, or affirmatively, as a confession and \navoidance admitting the facts but denying their legal \neffect by alleging new facts. Shipman \u00a7 197\u2013199, at \n348. Pleas in confession and avoidance were divided \ninto two categories: pleas in justification or excuse and \npleas in discharge. Id. Pleas in discharge included \nbankruptcy, release, payment, and the statute of \nlimitations\u2014all of which alleged that the plaintiff\u2019s \ncause of action had \u201cbeen discharged by some matter \nsubsequent, either of fact or of law.\u201d Id \u00a7 198(b), at \n348; id. \u00a7 199, at 350; cf. Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c)(1). \nLike a statute of limitations issue, an exhaustion \ndefect arises after a \u00a7 1983 claim accrues and \ntherefore is more analogous to a matter in discharge \nthan in abatement. And a judge would never have \n\n17 \n \n \ndecided disputed facts posed by a plea in discharge. If \nthe plea contained a traverse disputing the plaintiff\u2019s \nfacts, the issue was joined and a jury trial was \ntriggered. If the plea was instead framed as a \nconfession and avoidance, then the ball was in the \nplaintiff\u2019s court. See Perry, at 179\u201380, 272\u201373. The \nplaintiff could respond with his own demurrer, \naccepting the new facts alleged in avoidance but \ndenying their legal effect, which would frame up an \nissue of law for the judge. Id. Or the plaintiff could \nrespond with a traverse to the plea, joining issue on \nthe merits and triggering a trial. See id. There were \nsome other ways to procure judicial decision of a true \nquestion of law, such as the arcane concept of \u201cexpress \ncolor\u201d in trespass actions.5 As far as counsel can \ndetermine, however, a defendant could never procure \njudicial resolution of disputed facts relevant to a \ndispositive affirmative defense like exhaustion. \n \nII.  \nTHE \nPETITION \nOVERSTATES \nTHE \nSUPPOSED \nCONFLICT \nWITH \nTHE \nPLRA\u2019S PURPOSES, WHICH DO NOT \nTRUMP THE SEVENTH AMENDMENT \nIN ANY EVENT \n \nThe Seventh Circuit justified its distortion of \ntraditional jury trial principles because it thought \n\u201c[t]he alternative . . . is unsatisfactory\u201d and \u201cwould \nthwart Congress\u2019s effort to bar trials of prisoner \n                                                 \n5 See Shipman \u00a7\u00a7 200\u2013202, at 350\u201355; Perry, at 274\u201376. Even \nthen, if the issue of law was not \u201cwholly foreign to the merits of \nthe cause,\u201d Shipman \u00a7 202, at 354\u201355, and could not be \n\u201csegregate[d] . . . from the remaining matters of fact,\u201d Perry, at \n275, then the defendant could not withdraw the matter from the \njury.  \n\n18 \n \n \ncases in which the prisoner has failed to exhaust his \nadministrative remedies.\u201d Pavey, 544 F.3d at 742. \nThe petition doubles down on that position, devoting \nbarrels of ink to arguing that Congress intended to \nmake exhaustion a \u201cthreshold issue[] of judicial \nadministration,\u201d Pet. 17 (quoting Lee v. Willey, 789 \nF.3d 673, 678 (6th Cir. 2015)), to weed out frivolous \nclaims. The petition notably ignores the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s conclusion that Richards\u2019s allegations were \n\u201cserious and detailed\u201d and could not \u201creasonably be \nconsidered frivolous.\u201d Pet. App. 8a. Instead, the \npetition elects to criticizes the Sixth Circuit for \n\u201cfail[ing] \nto \ngive \ndeference\u201d \nin \nits \nSeventh \nAmendment \nanalysis \nto \nCongress\u2019s \nsupposed \nobjectives, Pet. 20. \nAll of this is both irrelevant and overstated. It is \nirrelevant because Congress\u2019s desire to reduce the \nworkload of the federal courts does not give it a free \npass to violate the Bill of Rights. If the Seventh \nAmendment protects a right to jury resolution of all \nfacts intertwined with the merits of a legal claim \n(and it does) then the Seventh Amendment controls. \nCongress has ample tools to address this perceived \nproblem without violating the jury trial right, and it \nhas used them\u2014aggressively.  \nThese concerns are overstated for a couple of \nreasons. First, in Woodford and Jones this Court has \nalready rejected the once-pervasive arguments and \nholdings that PLRA exhaustion is a jurisdictional or \nquasi-jurisdictional right not to face litigation at all, \nwhich necessarily must be resolved before anything \nelse happens in a case. Prior to Woodford and Jones, \nthe lower courts invented procedural vehicles found \nnowhere \nin \nthe \nFederal \nRules, \nsuch \nas \nthe \n\u201cunenumerated 12(b) motion,\u201d Wyatt v. Terhune, 315 \n\n19 \n \n \nF.3d 1108 (9th Cir. 2003); requiring prisoner plaintiffs \nto plead exhaustion with specificity up front; or \ndismissing entire complaints if any claim was not \nexhausted. See Jones, 549 U.S. at 203 (holding that \nthese innovations \u201cexceed[ed] the proper limits on the \njudicial role\u201d). But this Court held that exhaustion is \nan ordinary affirmative defense. See id. at 212-214. \nAffirmative defenses (all of them) must be raised by \nanswer under Rule 8(c), which places the burden of \nproof on the defendant and leaves the question to be \nresolved in the ordinary course through summary \njudgment or trial. No doubt the lower courts find those \nholdings inconvenient (or \u201cunsatisfactory,\u201d Pavey, 544 \nF.3d at 742), but they represent this Court\u2019s \nconclusion that in fact Congress did not intend to \nmake exhaustion of administrative remedies some \nkind of threshold super-requirement. When it wants \nto, Congress knows how to write jurisdictional \nstatutes, or immunity statutes like the Foreign \nSovereign Immunities Act, which create a vehicle for \nthreshold resolution of some important issue before \nanything else happens. It did not take that course in \nthe PLRA, and this Court has already said so. See id. \nat 216 (noting the conspicuous \u201cfailure of Congress to \ninclude exhaustion in terms among the enumerated \ngrounds justifying dismissal upon early screening\u201d). \nSecond, the Sixth Circuit\u2019s holding is narrow and \nthere is no reason to think it will have a dramatic \nimpact on prisoner litigation. The Sixth Circuit \n\u201cemphasize[d] that a jury trial is appropriate in \nthese circumstances only if the district court finds \nthat genuine disputes of material fact concerning \nPLRA exhaustion are decisive of the merits of the \nplaintiff\u2019s claim.\u201d Pet. App. 19a. (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). The petition argues that every \n\n20 \n \n \nprisoner suit will somehow allege exhaustion facts \nintertwined with the merits, but the ordinary rules \nof civil procedure are up to that challenge\u2014and if \nnot this Court has, \u201c[i]n a series of recent cases, . . . \nexplained that courts should generally not depart \nfrom the usual practice under the Federal Rules on \nthe basis of perceived policy concerns.\u201d See id. at \n212. The Sixth Circuit\u2019s rule has already been \napplied in district courts throughout the Second \nCircuit for more than a decade without issue. See \nPet. App. 15a-16a.  \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nThe petition should be denied.  \n \n \n \n \n \nJ.

It will detail their interpretation of the Seventh Amendment, the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), and relevant precedents. Without this information, any prediction would be based on a superficial understanding of the legal question. This action is critical for moving from a general awareness of the case to a deep analysis of the specific arguments the Justices will be evaluating.\n\nDesign EIG is moderate (0.4). The action of reading the petitioner's brief is a fundamental and well-established step in legal analysis. While not a novel strategy, its successful execution and the high value of the information it yields reinforce the importance of a structured, primary-source-first approach to case analysis. It helps confirm that a core part of the prediction process design is to systematically gather and analyze the primary briefs from the parties involved. It doesn't teach a new method, but it solidifies the value of an existing one.\n\nJoint EIG is high (1.3) because the massive gain in task-specific knowledge is essential for making an informed prediction, and the action also serves to validate a core component of the overall strategic design.",

This Court has held that judges can \ndecide facts related to threshold issues\u2014\nlike exhaustion\u2014without violating the \nSeventh Amendment. .................................. 16 \nB. The Seventh Amendment does not \npreserve the right to a jury trial on any \nfactual questions concerning exhaustion \nbecause exhaustion derives from equity. .... 19 \n\niii \n \n1. The Seventh Amendment guarantees \na jury trial right only as to issues \ntried by a jury in suits at common \nlaw at the time the Seventh \nAmendment was adopted. ..................... 20 \n2. Exhaustion did not exist at the \ncommon law, but closely analogous \nequitable issues were not decided by \njuries in 1791. ........................................ 22 \na. No historical antecedent to \nexhaustion existed at common \nlaw, but its origins are equitable \nin nature. ......................................... 23 \nb. Traditional equitable defenses \nsuch as adequate remedy at law, \nforum non conveniens, \nabstention, and habeas corpus \nbars are an appropriate common-\nlaw analog for exhaustion. .............. 27 \n3.

The \nopinion of the United States District Court for the \nWestern District of Michigan (Pet. App. 22a\u201328a) is \nnot reported but is available at 2022 WL 842654. \nJURISDICTION \nThe district court had jurisdiction over claims \nbrought by Respondent Kyle Brandon Richards under \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. The district \ncourt entered judgment for Petitioner Thomas Perttu \non March 22, 2022. Richards filed a timely notice of \nappeal by right on April 11, 2022. The court of appeals \nhad jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s final \njudgment under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. This Court has ju-\nrisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \n \n \n\n2 \n \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe Seventh Amendment to the United States \nConstitution, U.S. Const. amend. VII, provides: \nIn suits at common law, where the value in \ncontroversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the \nright of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no \nfact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-ex-\namined in any Court of the United States, \nthan according to the rules of the common law. \nThe Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a), states in applicable part: \n(a) No action shall be brought with respect to \nprison conditions under section 1983 of this ti-\ntle, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner \nconfined in any jail, prison, or other correc-\ntional facility until such administrative reme-\ndies as are available are exhausted. \nINTRODUCTION \nThe importance of the Seventh Amendment right \nto a trial by jury is well recognized. Less clear, but \nequally important, is the central principle that under-\ngirds the right: preservation of the right to a jury\u2019s ul-\ntimate determination of issues of fact where a case \nproceeds to trial. Embedded in that principle is a tacit \nlimitation\u2014the Seventh Amendment does not guar-\nantee the right to a jury trial on every fact question \nwithin a jury-triable case. Rather, the right is impli-\ncated only when a particular issue or trial decision \nmust fall to the jury to maintain the substance of the \n\n3 \n \ncommon-law right as it existed in 1791. This limita-\ntion is consistent with this Court\u2019s jurisprudence\u2014\nboth its historical view of the Seventh Amendment \nand its treatment of cases involving an overlap of legal \nand equitable issues that implicate collateral estoppel \nconcerns as opposed to cases where those concerns are \nnot present.  \nThe issue of exhaustion under the PLRA is not one \nfor a jury. Exhaustion has no precise historical analog, \nand the closest analogs are forum-based equitable de-\nfenses, which were historically decided by judges, not \nby juries.  \nThis understanding endures even where the facts \nunderlying the question of exhaustion are intertwined \nwith the merits of a prisoner\u2019s claim. In this circum-\nstance, a judge\u2019s determination as to exhaustion does \nnot impinge on the \u201csubstance\u201d of the jury trial right\u2014\nthat right remains preserved. Where the prisoner has \nproperly exhausted administrative remedies, a jury \nmay then be impaneled to find the facts concerning \nthe underlying claims and will not be bound by the \njudge\u2019s earlier factual determinations. This division of \nduties is consistent with a judge\u2019s gatekeeping role, \ncomports with the goals of the PLRA, and protects the \nright to trial by jury. \n \n \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. The PLRA Framework \nIn 1970, just over 2,000 prisoner civil rights suits \nwere filed in federal courts. Margo Schlanger, Trends \nin Prisoner Litigation, as the PLRA Approaches 20, 28 \nCorr. L. Reporter, 69, 71 (2017). Shortly after that, fil-\nings exploded. Id.  \nIn 1980, Congress took a first stab at an exhaus-\ntion provision for prisoner suits filed under \u00a7 1983. \nUnder the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons \nAct, 94 Stat. 352, as amended, district courts could \nstay a prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 1983 suit for up to 180 days while \nthe prisoner pursued \u201cplain, speedy, and effective ad-\nministrative remedies.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a)(1) (for-\nmer). The exhaustion requirement was discretionary \nthough\u2014exhaustion could be required only if the \nstate\u2019s prison grievance system met federal standards \nand if exhaustion was \u201cappropriate and in the inter-\nests of justice.\u201d \u00a7 1997e(a)(1), (2). \nBut that exhaustion provision did not stem the \ntide of prisoner litigation. By the mid-1990s, correc-\ntional systems and federal courts were overburdened \nby a mammoth caseload of prisoner litigation. In 1995 \nalone, 39,053 prisoner lawsuits were filed in federal \ncourt, a rate of 24.6 per 1,000 prisoners. Schlanger, \nTrends in Prisoner Litigation, supra, at 71. Not sur-\nprisingly, this strained the resources of the federal \ncourt system, not to mention correctional systems.  \nIn 1996, Congress enacted the PLRA \u201cin the wake \nof a sharp rise in prisoner litigation in the federal \ncourts.\u201d Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 84 (2006) \n\n5 \n \n(citing Alexander v. Hawk, 159 F.3d 1321, 1324\u201325 \n(11th Cir. 1998) (citing statistics)). A significant com-\nponent of the PLRA was a robust, mandatory exhaus-\ntion requirement. Congress \u201cinvigorated the exhaus-\ntion prescription\u201d that had existed under the prior re-\ngime, now requiring prisoners to fully exhaust all of \ntheir available administrative remedies through the \ngrievance process as a prerequisite to filing suit in fed-\neral court. Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 524 (2002).  \nAs stated by this Court, \u201cBeyond doubt, Congress \nenacted \u00a7 1997e(a) to reduce the quantity and improve \nthe quality of prisoner suits.\u201d Id. at 524. To further \nthis end, \u201cCongress afforded corrections officials time \nand opportunity to address complaints internally\u201d \nprior to prisoners seeking relief in federal court. Id. at \n525. By giving correctional officials the opportunity to \naddress grievances, \u201ccorrective action taken in re-\nsponse to an inmate\u2019s grievance might improve prison \nadministration and satisfy the inmate, thereby obvi-\nating the need for litigation.\u201d Id. (citing Booth v. \nChurner, 532 U.S. 731, 737 (2001)). In addition, a \nprison\u2019s \u201cinternal review might \u2018filter out some frivo-\nlous claims.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting Booth, 532 U.S. at 737). \nAnd the administrative record created by the prisons\u2019 \ninternal grievance processes would facilitate consider-\nation of those \u201ccases ultimately brought to court.\u201d Id. \n(citations omitted).  \nThe PLRA has been tremendously successful in \nreducing the burden on both prison officials and fed-\neral courts. From the peak of filings in 1995, within \nfive years of the passage of the PLRA prisoner law-\nsuits had fallen by 43%, even though the total prisoner \npopulation grew by 23%. Margo Schlanger, Inmate \n\n6 \n \nLitigation, 116 Harv. L. Rev. 1555, 1694 (2003). This \ndecline continued for several more years. By 2006, the \ndecline reached 60%. Margo Schlanger & Giovanna \nShay, Preserving the Rule of Law in America\u2019s Jails \nand Prisons: The Case for Amending the Prison Liti-\ngation Reform Act, 11 U. Pa. J. Const. L. 139, 141\u201342 \n(2008). Although the decline gradually plateaued, by \n2014, prisoners filed 25,324 lawsuits, a rate of 11.6 per \n1,000 prisoners. Schlanger, Trends in Prisoner Litiga-\ntion, supra, at 71. Compared to 1995, this represents \na 34% decrease in the number of prisoner lawsuits and \na 53% decline in the rate of lawsuits filed per 1,000 \nprisoners. See id. The exhaustion requirement has \nbeen a critical component of the PLRA\u2019s success.  \nB. MDOC\u2019s grievance process \nThe Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC) \nhas two separate processes for grievances. One is the \nstandard grievance procedure, governed by MDOC \nPolicy Directive 03.02.130, which is not applicable \nhere. J.A. 41\u201361. The other is the administrative pro-\ncess under the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA), \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 15601, et seq., and the Prohibited Sexual \nConduct Involving Prisoners policy (effective date \n04/24/2017), governed by MDOC Policy Directive \n03.03.140. J.A. 62\u201387.  \nThe PREA grievance procedure applies to Rich-\nards\u2019 claims of sexual abuse, harassment, and miscon-\nduct. MDOC uses a two-step process for PREA griev-\nances, both of which must be exhausted. J.A. 74\u201375. \nMDOC will not facially reject or deny grievances al-\nleging sexual abuse. J.A. 74\u201375. Instead, such \n\n7 \n \ngrievances must be investigated. J.A. 76. \u201cA prisoner \nmay file a PREA grievance at any time.\u201d J.A. 75.  \nA prisoner initiates the first step of the process by \nfiling a PREA Prisoner Grievance Form (Step I). \nJ.A. 75. Prisoners may grieve retaliation for reporting \nsexual abuse, harassment, or misconduct through the \nPREA grievance process. J.A. 72\u201373. PREA griev-\nances may not be referred to MDOC staff who are the \nsubject of the grievance. J.A. 76.  \nAt Step I, the PREA Coordinator1 must ensure \nthat \u201ca written response is provided to the prisoner \nwithin 60 calendar days of receipt of the Step I PREA \nGrievance,\u201d although an extension of up to 70 calen-\ndar days may be requested. J.A. 76\u201377. Prisoners \nmust be notified in writing of any extensions and the \ndue date for a response. J.A. 76\u201377.  \nPrisoners may appeal a Step I decision to Step II \nif they are unsatisfied with the response or the re-\nsponse was not timely. J.A. 77. MDOC\u2019s response to a \nStep II appeal is due within 90 calendar days of re-\nceipt, absent an extension, and it constitutes the final \ndecision in the matter. J.A. 77.  \nC. District Court Proceedings and Eviden-\ntiary Hearing \nRichards and co-Plaintiffs Kenneth Damon Pruitt \nand Robert Kissee filed suit under \u00a7 1983, alleging \nthat Perttu, a Resident Unit Manager (RUM) for the \nMDOC, sexually harassed them and other prisoners, \n \n1 Every prison has a PREA Coordinator designated by the war-\nden. J.A. 67.  \n\n8 \n \nretaliated against them, and destroyed their property, \nin violation of the First, Fifth, and Eighth Amend-\nments. J.A. 1\u201338. Perttu moved for summary judg-\nment, asserting that Richards and his co-Plaintiffs \nfailed to exhaust administrative remedies before filing \ntheir complaint. Pet. App. 3a. Richards and his co-\nPlaintiffs alleged that Perttu had destroyed their \ngrievances or otherwise prevented them from being \nprocessed, making the grievance process unavailable. \nPet. App. 30a, 37a, 59a\u201360a. \nThe district court denied Perttu\u2019s motion, finding \nthat there was a question of fact as to whether the \ngrievance process was available to Richards due to his \nallegation that Perttu interfered with his grievance \nfilings. Pet. App. 79a\u201381a, 83a.  \nFollowing this ruling, the magistrate judge con-\nducted an evidentiary hearing on the issue of exhaus-\ntion. J.A. 88\u2013368. Evaluating the testimony, evidence, \nand arguments presented, the magistrate judge rec-\nommended that the district court conclude that Perttu \ncarried his burden of establishing \u201cthat Plaintiffs \nfailed to exhaust any of their claims before filing suit,\u201d \nPet. App. 64a, 76a, and that the \u201cadministrative rem-\nedies were generally available\u201d to Richards and his co-\nPlaintiffs. Pet. App. 68a.  \nIn reaching that conclusion, the magistrate judge \nfound that Richards\u2019 direct examinations, which re-\nlied on leading questions, undermined the credibility \nof his witnesses. Pet. App. 69a. The magistrate judge \nthen discussed how the circumstances surrounding \nthe alleged observations of Perttu destroying griev-\nances similarly undermined Plaintiffs\u2019 credibility. Pet. \nApp. 71a\u201373a. Notably, the evidence \u201cdemonstrate[d] \n\n9 \n \nthat RUM Perttu could not, and in fact did not, inter-\ncept and destroy all grievances filed by Plaintiffs in \nthe relevant time\u201d: \n[E]ven on the dates that RUM Perttu worked, \nhe testified that he only works from 7:00am to \n3:30pm. Moreover, RUM Perttu did not work \nseven days a week every week from June 2019 \nto March 2020. Indeed, on at least one of the \ndates on which Richards alleges Perttu de-\nstroyed his grievances, January 1, 2020, \nPerttu testified that he was not working due \nto the New Years holiday. \nPet. App. 73a\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

This Court has held that judges can \ndecide facts related to threshold issues\u2014\nlike exhaustion\u2014without violating the \nSeventh Amendment. .................................. 16 \nB. The Seventh Amendment does not \npreserve the right to a jury trial on any \nfactual questions concerning exhaustion \nbecause exhaustion derives from equity. .... 19 \n\niii \n \n1. The Seventh Amendment guarantees \na jury trial right only as to issues \ntried by a jury in suits at common \nlaw at the time the Seventh \nAmendment was adopted. ..................... 20 \n2. Exhaustion did not exist at the \ncommon law, but closely analogous \nequitable issues were not decided by \njuries in 1791. ........................................ 22 \na. No historical antecedent to \nexhaustion existed at common \nlaw, but its origins are equitable \nin nature. ......................................... 23 \nb. Traditional equitable defenses \nsuch as adequate remedy at law, \nforum non conveniens, \nabstention, and habeas corpus \nbars are an appropriate common-\nlaw analog for exhaustion. .............. 27 \n3. Juries did not historically determine \nquestions of fact related to equitable \ndefenses analogous to exhaustion. ........ 33 \n4. Functional considerations \ndemonstrate that judges, not juries, \nshould determine exhaustion \nquestions. ............................................... 35 \nII. The Seventh Amendment does not preserve \nthe right to a jury trial on factual questions \nconcerning exhaustion even when those \nfactual questions are intertwined with the \nunderlying merits. .............................................. 37 \n\niv \n \nA. Beacon Theatres created a presumption \nthat juries should decide intertwined \nlegal and equitable issues, but that \npresumption does not apply here. ............... 38 \n1. The presumption does not apply \nbecause exhaustion is a threshold \nissue that is logically precedent to the \nmerits. .................................................... 41 \n2. The presumption does not apply \nbecause a judge\u2019s factual findings \nregarding exhaustion would not \npreclude a jury\u2019s consideration of the \nsame facts when determining the \nmerits of the legal claim. ....................... 43 \nB. Unlike in Beacon Theatres, a judicial \ndetermination of exhaustion would \nimplement congressional intent. ................. 46 \nConclusion ................................................................. 48 \n \n\nv \n \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES \nPage \nCases \nAlbino v.

The \nopinion of the United States District Court for the \nWestern District of Michigan (Pet. App. 22a\u201328a) is \nnot reported but is available at 2022 WL 842654. \nJURISDICTION \nThe district court had jurisdiction over claims \nbrought by Respondent Kyle Brandon Richards under \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. The district \ncourt entered judgment for Petitioner Thomas Perttu \non March 22, 2022. Richards filed a timely notice of \nappeal by right on April 11, 2022. The court of appeals \nhad jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s final \njudgment under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. This Court has ju-\nrisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \n \n \n\n2 \n \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe Seventh Amendment to the United States \nConstitution, U.S. Const. amend. VII, provides: \nIn suits at common law, where the value in \ncontroversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the \nright of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no \nfact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-ex-\namined in any Court of the United States, \nthan according to the rules of the common law. \nThe Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a), states in applicable part: \n(a) No action shall be brought with respect to \nprison conditions under section 1983 of this ti-\ntle, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner \nconfined in any jail, prison, or other correc-\ntional facility until such administrative reme-\ndies as are available are exhausted. \nINTRODUCTION \nThe importance of the Seventh Amendment right \nto a trial by jury is well recognized. Less clear, but \nequally important, is the central principle that under-\ngirds the right: preservation of the right to a jury\u2019s ul-\ntimate determination of issues of fact where a case \nproceeds to trial. Embedded in that principle is a tacit \nlimitation\u2014the Seventh Amendment does not guar-\nantee the right to a jury trial on every fact question \nwithin a jury-triable case. Rather, the right is impli-\ncated only when a particular issue or trial decision \nmust fall to the jury to maintain the substance of the \n\n3 \n \ncommon-law right as it existed in 1791. This limita-\ntion is consistent with this Court\u2019s jurisprudence\u2014\nboth its historical view of the Seventh Amendment \nand its treatment of cases involving an overlap of legal \nand equitable issues that implicate collateral estoppel \nconcerns as opposed to cases where those concerns are \nnot present.  \nThe issue of exhaustion under the PLRA is not one \nfor a jury. Exhaustion has no precise historical analog, \nand the closest analogs are forum-based equitable de-\nfenses, which were historically decided by judges, not \nby juries.  \nThis understanding endures even where the facts \nunderlying the question of exhaustion are intertwined \nwith the merits of a prisoner\u2019s claim. In this circum-\nstance, a judge\u2019s determination as to exhaustion does \nnot impinge on the \u201csubstance\u201d of the jury trial right\u2014\nthat right remains preserved. Where the prisoner has \nproperly exhausted administrative remedies, a jury \nmay then be impaneled to find the facts concerning \nthe underlying claims and will not be bound by the \njudge\u2019s earlier factual determinations. This division of \nduties is consistent with a judge\u2019s gatekeeping role, \ncomports with the goals of the PLRA, and protects the \nright to trial by jury. \n \n \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. The PLRA Framework \nIn 1970, just over 2,000 prisoner civil rights suits \nwere filed in federal courts. Margo Schlanger, Trends \nin Prisoner Litigation, as the PLRA Approaches 20, 28 \nCorr. L. Reporter, 69, 71 (2017). Shortly after that, fil-\nings exploded. Id.  \nIn 1980, Congress took a first stab at an exhaus-\ntion provision for prisoner suits filed under \u00a7 1983. \nUnder the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons \nAct, 94 Stat. 352, as amended, district courts could \nstay a prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 1983 suit for up to 180 days while \nthe prisoner pursued \u201cplain, speedy, and effective ad-\nministrative remedies.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a)(1) (for-\nmer). The exhaustion requirement was discretionary \nthough\u2014exhaustion could be required only if the \nstate\u2019s prison grievance system met federal standards \nand if exhaustion was \u201cappropriate and in the inter-\nests of justice.\u201d \u00a7 1997e(a)(1), (2). \nBut that exhaustion provision did not stem the \ntide of prisoner litigation. By the mid-1990s, correc-\ntional systems and federal courts were overburdened \nby a mammoth caseload of prisoner litigation. In 1995 \nalone, 39,053 prisoner lawsuits were filed in federal \ncourt, a rate of 24.6 per 1,000 prisoners. Schlanger, \nTrends in Prisoner Litigation, supra, at 71. Not sur-\nprisingly, this strained the resources of the federal \ncourt system, not to mention correctional systems.  \nIn 1996, Congress enacted the PLRA \u201cin the wake \nof a sharp rise in prisoner litigation in the federal \ncourts.\u201d Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 84 (2006) \n\n5 \n \n(citing Alexander v. Hawk, 159 F.3d 1321, 1324\u201325 \n(11th Cir. 1998) (citing statistics)). A significant com-\nponent of the PLRA was a robust, mandatory exhaus-\ntion requirement. Congress \u201cinvigorated the exhaus-\ntion prescription\u201d that had existed under the prior re-\ngime, now requiring prisoners to fully exhaust all of \ntheir available administrative remedies through the \ngrievance process as a prerequisite to filing suit in fed-\neral court. Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 524 (2002).  \nAs stated by this Court, \u201cBeyond doubt, Congress \nenacted \u00a7 1997e(a) to reduce the quantity and improve \nthe quality of prisoner suits.\u201d Id. at 524. To further \nthis end, \u201cCongress afforded corrections officials time \nand opportunity to address complaints internally\u201d \nprior to prisoners seeking relief in federal court. Id. at \n525. By giving correctional officials the opportunity to \naddress grievances, \u201ccorrective action taken in re-\nsponse to an inmate\u2019s grievance might improve prison \nadministration and satisfy the inmate, thereby obvi-\nating the need for litigation.\u201d Id. (citing Booth v. \nChurner, 532 U.S. 731, 737 (2001)). In addition, a \nprison\u2019s \u201cinternal review might \u2018filter out some frivo-\nlous claims.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting Booth, 532 U.S. at 737). \nAnd the administrative record created by the prisons\u2019 \ninternal grievance processes would facilitate consider-\nation of those \u201ccases ultimately brought to court.\u201d Id. \n(citations omitted).  \nThe PLRA has been tremendously successful in \nreducing the burden on both prison officials and fed-\neral courts. From the peak of filings in 1995, within \nfive years of the passage of the PLRA prisoner law-\nsuits had fallen by 43%, even though the total prisoner \npopulation grew by 23%. Margo Schlanger, Inmate \n\n6 \n \nLitigation, 116 Harv. L. Rev. 1555, 1694 (2003). This \ndecline continued for several more years. By 2006, the \ndecline reached 60%. Margo Schlanger & Giovanna \nShay, Preserving the Rule of Law in America\u2019s Jails \nand Prisons: The Case for Amending the Prison Liti-\ngation Reform Act, 11 U. Pa. J. Const. L. 139, 141\u201342 \n(2008). Although the decline gradually plateaued, by \n2014, prisoners filed 25,324 lawsuits, a rate of 11.6 per \n1,000 prisoners. Schlanger, Trends in Prisoner Litiga-\ntion, supra, at 71. Compared to 1995, this represents \na 34% decrease in the number of prisoner lawsuits and \na 53% decline in the rate of lawsuits filed per 1,000 \nprisoners. See id. The exhaustion requirement has \nbeen a critical component of the PLRA\u2019s success.  \nB. MDOC\u2019s grievance process \nThe Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC) \nhas two separate processes for grievances. One is the \nstandard grievance procedure, governed by MDOC \nPolicy Directive 03.02.130, which is not applicable \nhere. J.A. 41\u201361. The other is the administrative pro-\ncess under the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA), \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 15601, et seq., and the Prohibited Sexual \nConduct Involving Prisoners policy (effective date \n04/24/2017), governed by MDOC Policy Directive \n03.03.140. J.A. 62\u201387.  \nThe PREA grievance procedure applies to Rich-\nards\u2019 claims of sexual abuse, harassment, and miscon-\nduct. MDOC uses a two-step process for PREA griev-\nances, both of which must be exhausted. J.A. 74\u201375. \nMDOC will not facially reject or deny grievances al-\nleging sexual abuse. J.A. 74\u201375. Instead, such \n\n7 \n \ngrievances must be investigated. J.A. 76. \u201cA prisoner \nmay file a PREA grievance at any time.\u201d J.A. 75.  \nA prisoner initiates the first step of the process by \nfiling a PREA Prisoner Grievance Form (Step I). \nJ.A. 75. Prisoners may grieve retaliation for reporting \nsexual abuse, harassment, or misconduct through the \nPREA grievance process. J.A. 72\u201373. PREA griev-\nances may not be referred to MDOC staff who are the \nsubject of the grievance. J.A. 76.  \nAt Step I, the PREA Coordinator1 must ensure \nthat \u201ca written response is provided to the prisoner \nwithin 60 calendar days of receipt of the Step I PREA \nGrievance,\u201d although an extension of up to 70 calen-\ndar days may be requested. J.A. 76\u201377. Prisoners \nmust be notified in writing of any extensions and the \ndue date for a response. J.A. 76\u201377.  \nPrisoners may appeal a Step I decision to Step II \nif they are unsatisfied with the response or the re-\nsponse was not timely. J.A. 77. MDOC\u2019s response to a \nStep II appeal is due within 90 calendar days of re-\nceipt, absent an extension, and it constitutes the final \ndecision in the matter. J.A. 77.  \nC. District Court Proceedings and Eviden-\ntiary Hearing \nRichards and co-Plaintiffs Kenneth Damon Pruitt \nand Robert Kissee filed suit under \u00a7 1983, alleging \nthat Perttu, a Resident Unit Manager (RUM) for the \nMDOC, sexually harassed them and other prisoners, \n \n1 Every prison has a PREA Coordinator designated by the war-\nden. J.A. 67.  \n\n8 \n \nretaliated against them, and destroyed their property, \nin violation of the First, Fifth, and Eighth Amend-\nments. J.A. 1\u201338. Perttu moved for summary judg-\nment, asserting that Richards and his co-Plaintiffs \nfailed to exhaust administrative remedies before filing \ntheir complaint. Pet. App. 3a. Richards and his co-\nPlaintiffs alleged that Perttu had destroyed their \ngrievances or otherwise prevented them from being \nprocessed, making the grievance process unavailable. \nPet. App. 30a, 37a, 59a\u201360a. \nThe district court denied Perttu\u2019s motion, finding \nthat there was a question of fact as to whether the \ngrievance process was available to Richards due to his \nallegation that Perttu interfered with his grievance \nfilings. Pet. App. 79a\u201381a, 83a.  \nFollowing this ruling, the magistrate judge con-\nducted an evidentiary hearing on the issue of exhaus-\ntion. J.A. 88\u2013368. Evaluating the testimony, evidence, \nand arguments presented, the magistrate judge rec-\nommended that the district court conclude that Perttu \ncarried his burden of establishing \u201cthat Plaintiffs \nfailed to exhaust any of their claims before filing suit,\u201d \nPet. App. 64a, 76a, and that the \u201cadministrative rem-\nedies were generally available\u201d to Richards and his co-\nPlaintiffs. Pet. App. 68a.  \nIn reaching that conclusion, the magistrate judge \nfound that Richards\u2019 direct examinations, which re-\nlied on leading questions, undermined the credibility \nof his witnesses. Pet. App. 69a. The magistrate judge \nthen discussed how the circumstances surrounding \nthe alleged observations of Perttu destroying griev-\nances similarly undermined Plaintiffs\u2019 credibility. Pet. \nApp. 71a\u201373a. Notably, the evidence \u201cdemonstrate[d] \n\n9 \n \nthat RUM Perttu could not, and in fact did not, inter-\ncept and destroy all grievances filed by Plaintiffs in \nthe relevant time\u201d: \n[E]ven on the dates that RUM Perttu worked, \nhe testified that he only works from 7:00am to \n3:30pm. Moreover, RUM Perttu did not work \nseven days a week every week from June 2019 \nto March 2020. Indeed, on at least one of the \ndates on which Richards alleges Perttu de-\nstroyed his grievances, January 1, 2020, \nPerttu testified that he was not working due \nto the New Years holiday. \nPet. App. 73a. \nMoreover, the evidence showed that Richards had \naccess to the grievance process: \nBut even had Perttu been working every hour \nof every day . . . Richards actually took ad-\nvantage of the grievance procedure by filing \nStep I grievance forms twenty-six times be-\ntween June 6, 2019, and April 23, 2020.  \n* * * \nMoreover, of Richards\u2019s six Step I grievance \nforms entered into evidence, three specifically \ngrieved RUM Perttu, undermining any allega-\ntion that Perttu sorted through the grievances \nand discarded those directed towards him.  \nPet. App. 73a\u201374a.  \n\n10 \n \nThe magistrate judge noted that \u201cRichards\u2019s suc-\ncessful use of the grievance procedure . . . directly con-\ntradicts Plaintiffs\u2019 claim that administrative remedies \nwere effectively unavailable, and Plaintiffs\u2019 failure \n[to] use any of the alternative reporting methods . . . \ncasts doubt on their alleged attempts to file PREA \ngrievances.\u201d Pet. App. 75a.  \nThe magistrate judge found that \u201cPlaintiffs pro-\nvided no evidence that RUM Perttu\u201d influenced the \ncorrections officers he supervised to destroy or not \nprocess their grievances. Pet. App. 75a. Indeed, \u201cthe \ncredibility of Plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses was undermined by \ntheir inability to independently recollect the time or \nlocation of RUM Perttu\u2019s alleged destruction of Plain-\ntiff\u2019s grievances, as well as the unlikely circumstances \nunder which they claimed they observed such destruc-\ntion.\u201d Pet. App. 75a\u201376a. For instance, as a matter of \n\u201ccommon sense,\u201d Perttu could not have been \u201cpresent \nto intercept every grievance\u201d filed by Plaintiffs. Pet. \nApp. 76a. Based on these findings, the magistrate \njudge recommended that the district court conclude \nthat Richards and his co-Plaintiffs failed to exhaust \ntheir claims against Perttu and dismiss their claims \nwithout prejudice. Pet. App. 76a.  \nRichards and his co-Plaintiffs filed nine objec-\ntions, which the district court overruled. Pet. App. \n22a\u201328a. The district court adopted the report and \nrecommendation and entered judgment for Perttu. \nPet. App. 29a. Richards alone appealed the district \ncourt\u2019s ruling.  \n\n11 \n \nD. Sixth Circuit Proceedings \nOn appeal, Richards argued that the district court \nerred by not granting him a jury trial to resolve the \nexhaustion issue, which he claimed was intertwined \nwith the merits of his case.  \nThe Sixth Circuit began its analysis by discussing \nwhether the exhaustion issue was intertwined with \nRichards\u2019 underlying retaliation claim, noting that \nRichards alleged that Perttu destroyed his grievances, \npreventing him from exhausting the grievance re-\nquirements. Richards\u2019 complaint, the Sixth Circuit \nsaid, \u201clays out several specific instances when Perttu \nallegedly destroyed grievances that Richards had in-\ntended to file.\u201d Pet. App. 2a\u20133a. This allegedly \u201cinter-\nfered with Richards\u2019s speech.\u201d Pet. App. 10a. Under \nthese circumstances, the court concluded that \u201cthe \nfactual disputes regarding exhaustion . . . are inter-\ntwined with the merits of Richards\u2019s retaliation \nclaim.\u201d Pet. App. 12a. \nThe Sixth Circuit turned its attention to whether \nthis intertwining implicated the Seventh Amendment \nright to a jury trial. The court recognized that, in Lee \nv. Willey, 789 F.3d 673 (6th Cir. 2015), it held that the \nprisoner had no right to a jury trial for an exhaustion \ndefense under the PLRA. Pet. App. 13a. But the court \nnoted that Lee did not govern the present case because \nthe disputed facts of the exhaustion issue were not \n\u201c \u2018bound up with the merits of the underlying dis-\npute.\u2019 \u201d Pet. App. 13a (quoting Lee, 789 F.3d at 678).  \nThe Sixth Circuit then looked to the other circuits, \nnoting that only the Seventh Circuit had squarely ad-\ndressed the issue, in Pavey v. Conley, 544 F.3d 739 \n\n12 \n \n(7th Cir. 2008). There, the Seventh Circuit held that \nprisoners had no right to a jury trial to determine \nwhether they had exhausted their administrative \nremedies under the PLRA, regardless of whether the \nexhaustion issue is intertwined with the merits of the \ncase. Pet. App. 14a (citing Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741\u201342). \nAccording to the Seventh Circuit, \u201c[j]uries decide \ncases, not issues of judicial traffic control.\u201d Pavey, 544 \nF.3d at 741. The Ninth Circuit agreed with the rea-\nsoning of Pavey in Albino v. Baca, 747 F.3d 1162, 1171 \n(9th Cir. 2014) (en banc) (citations omitted). Pet. App. \n14a. \nInstead of following the reasoning of the Seventh \nand Ninth Circuits, the Sixth Circuit found \u201cseveral \ndistrict-court decisions in the Second Circuit\u201d more \nconvincing. Pet. App. 15a\u201317a. It ultimately con-\ncluded that \u201cRichards was stripped of his right to a \njury\u2019s resolution of the ultimate dispute\u201d because he \nwas denied a jury trial on the exhaustion issue. Pet. \nApp. 17a (internal citation omitted). The Sixth Circuit \nalso relied on Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Co. v. Rail-\nway Express Agency, Inc., 253 F.2d 780, 784 (6th Cir. \n1958). Pet. App. 17a\u201319a. In Fireman\u2019s Fund, the \nSixth Circuit had held that when jurisdiction is inter-\ntwined with the merits of the case, the issue cannot be \nsummarily decided where factual claims would not be \nsubject to cross-examination. 253 F.2d at 784 (\u201cthe \nmerits of a controversy could be summarily decided, \npartly on affidavits without the right of cross-exami-\nnation\u201d) (citation omitted). \nThe Sixth Circuit held that the district court erred \nby ordering an evidentiary hearing rather than a jury \ntrial on the issue of exhaustion, \u201cemphasiz[ing] that a \n\n13 \n \njury trial is appropriate in these circumstances only if \nthe district court finds that genuine disputes of mate-\nrial fact concerning PLRA exhaustion are \u2018decisive of \nthe merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claim.\u2019 \u201d Pet. App. 19a \n(quoting Fireman\u2019s Fund, 253 F.2d at 784). \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe PLRA mandates that prisoners exhaust ad-\nministrative remedies before filing a lawsuit in fed-\neral court. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). Despite this precon-\ndition to suit, the Sixth Circuit held that prisoners are \nentitled to a jury trial when exhaustion disputes are \nintertwined with the merits of their claims. This con-\nclusion is not grounded in the Seventh Amendment. \n1. The Seventh Amendment permits courts to re-\nsolve disputed facts bearing on whether prisoners \nhave exhausted their claims. The Amendment pre-\nserves the right to a jury trial as it existed under the \nEnglish common law in 1791. Consistent with the \nAmendment\u2019s language, this Court has adhered to a \n\u201chistorical test,\u201d which asks two questions: (1) \nwhether the cause of action at issue \u201ceither was tried \nat law at the time of the founding or is at least analo-\ngous to one that was,\u201d Markman v. Westview Instru-\nments, Inc., 517 U.S. 370, 376 (1996) (citation omit-\nted), and (2) \u201c[i]f the action in question belongs in the \nlaw category, . . . whether the particular [issue] . . . \nmust fall to the jury in order to preserve the substance \nof the common-law right as it existed in 1791,\u201d id.  \nThis case turns on the second question, which, as \nthis Court has emphasized, \u201cmust depend on whether \nthe jury must shoulder this responsibility as neces-\nsary to preserve the \u2018substance of the common-law \n\n14 \n \nright of trial by jury.\u2019 \u201d Tull v. United States, 481 U.S. \n412, 426 (1987) (quoting Colgrove v. Battin, 413 U.S. \n149, 157 (1973)). The Court answers this question \nmuch like its first\u2014by using a historical method, and \n\u201c[w]here there is no exact antecedent,\u201d by \u201ccomparing \nthe modern practice to earlier ones whose allocation \nto court or jury we do know.\u201d Markman, 517 U.S. at \n378 (citations omitted).  \nExhaustion did not exist in 1791, and it was not \nuntil the twentieth century that courts fully articu-\nlated the doctrine. Thus, there is no exact antecedent \nto look to for answers. But exhaustion\u2019s roots in courts \nof equity provide helpful guidance. Exhaustion was \napplied by those courts to promote an orderly proce-\ndure whereby an administrative forum was the appro-\npriate starting point for a dispute. Other forum-based \nequitable defenses\u2014such as the adequate remedy at \nlaw doctrine, forum non conveniens, abstention, and \nhabeas corpus bars\u2014therefore provide a suitable his-\ntorical analog.  \nAt common law, these defenses were not afforded \na jury trial right. This was true regardless of whether \nthose defenses were interposed in courts of law, in \nwhich case a court of equity would first dispose of the \nissue. Only where an issue at law remained would \nthat issue be jury-triable. Because these equitable de-\nfenses were not subject to a jury determination at \ncommon law, neither should exhaustion.  \nEven if these historical analogs are insufficient, \nfunctional considerations should guide this Court\u2019s \ndecision. In this regard, the PLRA\u2019s goals\u2014\u201cto reduce \nthe quantity and improve the quality of prisoner \nsuits,\u201d \nPorter, \n534 \nU.S. \nat \n524\u2014would \nbe \n\n15 \n \ncompromised, if not outright defeated, by a jury trial \non exhaustion. The PLRA allows prison officials the \nopportunity to address prisoner complaints prior to \nfederal-court interference. This, in turn, obviates the \nneed for some prisoner lawsuits and creates an admin-\nistrative record for those that are filed.  \nJudges also frequently decide threshold issues \nand are thus better positioned than juries to decide \nexhaustion questions. And due to the significant num-\nber of prisoner cases judges see, they are particularly \nwell-equipped to deal with questions about a prison\u2019s \ninternal operations. Consequently, an exhaustion \nquestion should be allocated to the judge, not a jury.  \n2. That a question of exhaustion is intertwined \nwith the merits of a prisoner\u2019s claim does not change \nthis outcome. While Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, \n359 U.S. 500 (1959), establishes a general rule priori-\ntizing legal issues over equitable ones, it is a pruden-\ntial rule that is premised on the recognition that an \nequitable determination could have a collateral-estop-\npel effect on the merits of a legal claim. These con-\ncerns are not present for an exhaustion determina-\ntion, which is a threshold, pre-merits ruling that the \njury may revisit if an exhausted claim goes to trial. \nFurther, this Court has previously considered \nwhether application of the Beacon Theatres rule would \nundermine a federal statute. Here, the PLRA\u2019s pur-\nposes would be severely undercut by a jury trial on ex-\nhaustion.  \nFor these reasons, the Seventh Amendment does \nnot preserve the right to a jury trial on exhaustion of \nadministrative remedies where disputed facts regard-\ning exhaustion are intertwined with merits of a claim. \n\n16 \n \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe Seventh Amendment does not preserve \nthe right to a jury trial on factual questions \nconcerning exhaustion. \nJudges frequently decide disputed questions of \nfact without violating the Seventh Amendment, par-\nticularly with respect to threshold issues. It is thus no \nsurprise that all courts of appeal to have considered \nthe issue have held that \u201cjudges may resolve factual \ndisputes relevant to the exhaustion issue without the \nparticipation of a jury.\u201d Small v. Camden Cnty., 728 \nF.3d 265, 269\u201371 (3d Cir. 2013); see also Lee, 789 F.3d \nat 677\u201378; Albino, 747 F.3d at 1170\u201371; Messa v. \nGoord, 652 F.3d 305, 308\u201310 (2d Cir. 2011) (per cu-\nriam); Dillon v. Rogers, 596 F.3d 260, 270\u201372 (5th Cir. \n2010); Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741\u201342; Bryant v. Rich, 530 \nF.3d 1368, 1373\u201377 (11th Cir. 2008). These holdings \nare consistent with the Seventh Amendment, which \napplies only to issues tried by a jury in suits at com-\nmon law in 1791. Exhaustion, although unknown at \ncommon law, is rooted in equity and closely analogous \nto traditional equitable defenses, which were not his-\ntorically determined by juries.  \nA. This Court has held that judges can de-\ncide facts related to threshold issues\u2014\nlike exhaustion\u2014without violating the \nSeventh Amendment.  \nAs a general matter, \u201cissues of law are to be re-\nsolved by the court and issues of fact are to be deter-\nmined by the jury.\u201d Baltimore & Carolina Line, Inc. v. \nRedman, 295 U.S. 654, 657 (1935). But this broad \nproposition overstates the Amendment\u2019s sweep, for \n\n17 \n \n\u201cthe Seventh Amendment was never intended to es-\ntablish the jury as the exclusive mechanism for fact-\nfinding in civil cases.\u201d Atlas Roofing Co. v. Occupa-\ntional Safety & Health Review Comm\u2019n, 430 U.S. 442, \n460 (1977); see also Galloway v. United States, 319 \nU.S. 372, 390 (1943) (\u201cThe jury was not absolute mas-\nter of fact in 1791.\u201d). In this vein, this Court has held \nthat the Seventh Amendment \u201cwas designed to pre-\nserve the basic institution of jury trial in only its most \nfundamental elements, not the great mass of proce-\ndural forms and details, varying even then [in 1791] \nso widely among common-law jurisdictions.\u201d Gallo-\nway, 319 U.S. at 392; see also Walker v. N. M. & S. P. \nR. Co., 165 U.S. 593, 596 (1897) (\u201cThe seventh amend-\nment . . . does not attempt to regulate matters of \npleading or practice[.]\u201d).  \nJudges thus frequently decide disputed questions \nof fact without violating the Seventh Amendment. For \nexample, this Court has held that judges may decide \nquestions of fact related to subject-matter jurisdiction, \nWetmore v. Rymer, 169 U.S. 115, 120\u201322 (1898); dis-\ncovery disputes, Herbert v. Lando, 441 U.S. 153, 177 \n(1979); class certifications, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. \nDukes, 564 U.S. 338, 351\u201352 (2011); evidentiary objec-\ntions, Galloway, 319 U.S. at 390; motions for sum-\nmary judgment, Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 \nU.S. 322, 336 (1979); motions for directed verdict, Gal-\nloway, 283 U.S. at 391\u201395; and motions to set aside \nthe verdict, Gasoline Products Co. v. Champlin Refin-\ning Co., 283 U.S. 494, 497\u201398 (1943).  \n \n \n\n18 \n \nThis makes sense for at least two reasons. First, a \njudge\u2019s ability to determine fact disputes related to \nthreshold questions is consistent with the under-\nstanding that \u201c \u2018[t]he Seventh Amendment does not \nconfer the right to a trial, but only the right to have a \njury hear the case once it is determined that the litiga-\ntion should proceed before a court.\u2019 \u201d Caley v. Gulf-\nstream Aerospace Corp., 428 F.3d 1359, 1371 (11th \nCir. 2005) (quoting Am. Heritage Life Ins. Co. v. Orr, \n294 F.3d 702, 711 (5th Cir. 2002)), cert. denied, 548 \nU.S. 1128 (2006). In this sense a judge acts as a gate-\nkeeper, guarding the courthouse doors from those who \nseek entry but have not yet satisfied mandatory pre-\nconditions to suit. Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741 (\u201cJuries de-\ncide cases, not issues of judicial traffic control.\u201d).  \nSecond, and relatedly, \u201c[t]he limitation imposed \nby the [Seventh] [A]mendment is merely that enjoy-\nment of the right of trial by jury be not obstructed, and \nthat the ultimate determination of issues of fact by the \njury be not interfered with.\u201d In re Peterson, 253 U.S. \n300, 310 (1920) (emphasis added). In other words, the \nSeventh Amendment \u201cis concerned with substance \nand not with form.\u201d Dimick v. Schiedt, 293 U.S. 474, \n490 (1935); see also id. (\u201cThere is nothing in its history \nor language to suggest that the amendment had any \npurpose but to preserve the essentials of the jury trial \nas it was known to the common law before the adop-\ntion of the Constitution.\u201d); Walker, 165 U.S. at 596 \n(\u201cSo long as this substance of right is preserved, the \nprocedure by which this result shall be reached is \nwholly within the discretion of the legislature . . . .\u201d). \nWhere the jury\u2019s ultimate determination of the facts is \nnot obviated, the judge may serve as factfinder. \n\n19 \n \nBoth of these underpinnings apply with full force \nin the exhaustion context. Exhaustion is a threshold \nquestion. Under the PLRA, \u201c[u]ntil the issue of ex-\nhaustion is resolved, the court cannot know whether \nit is to decide the case or the prison authorities are to.\u201d \nPavey, 544 F.3d at 741. Further, a judge\u2019s exhaustion \ndetermination does not interfere with a jury\u2019s ulti-\nmate factfinding responsibility because dismissals for \nfailure to exhaust are generally without prejudice.2 \nSee Snider v. Melindez, 199 F.3d 108, 111\u201312 (2d Cir. \n1999) (explaining that exhaustion \u201cis often a tempo-\nrary, curable, procedural flaw\u201d). A prisoner may later \nrefile the lawsuit, so long as the prison\u2019s grievance \nprocedure is satisfied. And if the prisoner\u2019s case ulti-\nmately proceeds to trial, the jury may revisit facts \nfound by the judge that may have been relevant to the \nexhaustion determination. See Part II; see also Pavey, \n544 F.3d at 742.  \nB. The Seventh Amendment does not pre-\nserve the right to a jury trial on any fac-\ntual questions concerning exhaustion be-\ncause exhaustion derives from equity.  \nAlthough the types of claims Richards brought are \nthose to which a jury trial applies, this Court has \n \n2 Along these lines, some courts have identified exhaustion as \nmatter in abatement, Bryant, 530 F.3d at 1374; Small, 728 F.3d \nat 269 n.3 (citation omitted), which is unsurprising since \u201cabate-\nment defense[s] defeat the particular action for procedural de-\nfects that are unrelated to the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claim,\u201d and \nthe plaintiff can therefore \u201ctypically correct the defects and pro-\nceed in another action,\u201d Hyman v. City of Gastonia, 466 F.3d 284, \n287 (4th Cir. 2006) (citing Bowles v. Wilke, 175 F.2d 35, 38 (7th \nCir. 1949)).  \n\n20 \n \nrecognized the need for a separate historical analysis \nfor particular issues or trial decisions within jury-ap-\npropriate claims. Under this analysis, there is no ex-\nact antecedent for exhaustion. But its equitable ori-\ngins and the characteristics of the doctrine show that \nits closest parallel lies in equitable defenses\u2014which \nwere historically decided by judges, not juries.  \n1. The Seventh Amendment guarantees \na jury trial right only as to issues \ntried by a jury in suits at common law \nat the time the Seventh Amendment \nwas adopted.  \nThe Seventh Amendment \u201cpreserve[s]\u201d the right \nto jury trial \u201c[i]n Suits at common law.\u201d U.S. Const. \namend. VII. Because the Amendment speaks in terms \nof preservation, this Court has long held that the \nscope of the right must be determined by reference to \nhistory. Indeed, \u201c[f]rom the beginning, it has been re-\ngarded as but subservient to the single purpose of the \nAmendment, to preserve the essentials of the jury \ntrial in actions at law, serving to distinguish them \nfrom suits in equity and admiralty[.]\u201d Dimick, 293 \nU.S. at 490\u201391 (citation omitted); Granfinanciera, \nS.A. v. Nordberg, 492 U.S. 33, 42 (1989) (explaining \nthat the Seventh Amendment applies to actions \u201cthat \nare analogous to common-law causes of action ordi-\nnarily decided in English law courts in the late 18th \ncentury, as opposed to those customarily heard by \ncourts of equity or admiralty\u201d) (citation omitted). Con-\nsistent with this command, \u201cresort must be had to the \nappropriate rules of the common law established at \nthe time of the adoption of that constitutional provi-\nsion in 1791.\u201d Dimick, 293 U.S. at 476. See also \n\n21 \n \nBaltimore & Carolina Line, Inc., 295 U.S. at 657 \n(\u201c[T]he right of trial by jury thus preserved is the right \nwhich existed under the English common law when \nthe Amendment was adopted.\u201d).  \nThis historical lens does not mean that the right \nto a jury trial is available only in suits \u201cwhich the com-\nmon law recognized among its old and settled proceed-\nings.\u201d Parsons v. Bedford, Breedlove & Robeson, 28 \nU.S. 433, 447 (1830). As this Court has noted, histori-\ncal analysis allows for reasoning by analogy. There-\nfore, the determination whether the Seventh Amend-\nment confers a right to a jury trial entails a two-part \ninquiry. A court first considers whether it is \u201c \u2018dealing \nwith a cause of action that either was tried at law at \nthe time of the founding or is at least analogous to one \nthat was.\u2019 \u201d City of Monterey v. Del Monte Dunes at \nMonterey, Ltd., 526 U.S. 687, 708 (1999) (quoting \nMarkman, 517 U.S. at 376). If a court determines that \n\u201cthe action in question belongs in the law category,\u201d it \nmust \u201cthen ask whether the particular trial decision \nmust fall to the jury in order to preserve the substance \nof the common-law right as it existed in 1791.\u201d Mark-\nman, 517 U.S. at 708 (emphasis added). See also Tull, \n481 U.S. at 426 (\u201c \u2018Only those incidents which are re-\ngarded as fundamental, as inherent in and of the es-\nsence of the system of trial by jury, are placed beyond \nthe reach of the legislature.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting Colgrove, 413 \nU.S. at 156 n.11.).  \nAs applied to this case, the first inquiry is \nstraightforward. While the scope of prisoners\u2019 federal \nrights was significantly limited at common law, see, \ne.g., Ruffin v. Commonwealth, 62 Va. 790, 799 (1871); \nBethea v. Crouse, 417 F.2d 504, 505 (10th Cir. 1969), \n\n22 \n \nfollowing Del Monte Dunes, 526 U.S. at 720\u201321, the \ntypes of claims that Richards brought\u2014\u00a7 1983 claims \nfor damages\u2014are those for which a jury trial applies.  \nThis conclusion is not the end of the inquiry, \nthough. Rather, it leads to the second question\u2014\nwhether the particular issue of exhaustion is \u201cproper \nfor determination by the jury.\u201d3 Id. at 718; see also id. \nat 731 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and in concurring \nin the judgment) (\u201cTo say that respondents had the \nright to a jury trial on their \u00a7 1983 claim is not to say \nthat they were entitled to have the jury decide every \nissue.\u201d); Google LLC v. Oracle Am., Inc. 593 U.S. 1, 25 \n(2021) (rejecting an argument that the jury should de-\ncide a fair-use defense). As explained below, it is not.  \n2. Exhaustion did not exist at the com-\nmon law, but closely analogous equi-\ntable issues were not decided by ju-\nries in 1791.  \nTo answer the second question\u2014whether exhaus-\ntion should be determined by a judge or jury\u2014this \nCourt again looks to history, asking \u201cwhether the par-\nticular issue, or analogous ones, were decided by judge \nor by jury in suits at common law at the time the Sev-\nenth Amendment was adopted.\u201d Del Monte Dunes, 526 \nU.S. at 718; see also Markman, 517 U.S. at 378 \n(\u201cWhere there is no exact antecedent, the best hope \n \n3 The practice of submitting some issues for judicial determina-\ntion, while others are submitted to the jury, is consistent with \nFed. R. Civ. P. 39(a) and (a)(2), which provides that a \u201ctrial on all \nissues so demanded must be by jury unless . . . the court . . . finds \nthat on some or all of those issues there is no federal right to a \njury trial.\u201d (Emphasis added).  \n\n23 \n \nlies in comparing the modern practice to earlier ones \nwhose allocation to court or jury we do know . . . seek-\ning the best analogy we can draw between an old and \nthe new.\u201d) (citations omitted); Tull, 481 U.S. at 420\u2013\n21 (explaining that courts must search the common \nlaw for \u201cappropriate analogies\u201d instead of a \u201cprecisely \nanalogous common-law cause of action\u201d). \nAlthough no exact antecedent for exhaustion ex-\nisted at common law, its origins lie in equity. These \norigins and exhaustion\u2019s characteristics result in an \nappropriate analog\u2014equitable defenses\u2014for which \nthere was no traditional right to a jury trial. \na. No historical antecedent to exhaustion \nexisted at common law, but its origins \nare equitable in nature. \nThe doctrine of exhaustion \u201cis as old as federal ad-\nministrative law,\u201d meaning that it did not begin to \ntake shape until the creation of the Interstate Com-\nmerce Commission in 1887. Raoul Berger, Exhaustion \nof Administrative Remedies, 48 Yale L.J. 981, 981 n.1 \n(1939). Intended as a rule of \u201corderly\u201d procedure de-\nsigned to allow administrative bodies to perform their \nstatutory functions without preliminary interference \nfrom the courts, United States v. Sing Tuck, 194 U.S. \n161, 168 (1904), the concept first arose in tax cases in \nwhich courts of equity refused to grant injunctive re-\nlief where a plaintiff failed to pursue administrative \nremedies.  \nIn Dundee Mortgage Trust Invest Co. v. Charlton, \n32 F. 192, 192\u201393 (C.C.D. Ore. 1887), for example, a \ncorporation brought suit in equity to enjoin the \n\n24 \n \ncollection of its taxes, arguing that the county asses-\nsor and county board of equalization had erred in their \nassessment. While the court agreed that the corpora-\ntion \u201cappear[ed] to be entitled to an injunction,\u201d id. at \n193, it nevertheless held that the corporation was not \nentitled to relief because it did not seek redress from \nthe county board of equalization, as provided by stat-\nute, id. at 193\u201394. \u201c[T]he plaintiff, having neglected to \navail itself of this means of redress, cannot maintain \na suit for relief in this court.\u201d Id. at 195; see also Alt-\nschul v. Gittings, 86 F. 200, 202 (C.C.D. Ore. 1898) \n(No. 2,236) (same); Brown v. Drain, 112 F. 582, 585 \n(C.C.S.D. Cal. 1901) (\u201cThe remedy of one who consid-\ners himself unfairly assessed is to apply for redress to \nthe statutory tribunal, if one is provided with the \npower to review.\u201d).  \nThe exhaustion concept was applied in courts of \nequity in other contexts as well. In Sing Tuck, an im-\nmigration case in which the Court denied a writ a ha-\nbeas corpus, the Court concluded that the petitioner \nfailed to comply with the \u201cmode of procedure which \nmust be followed before there can be resort to the \ncourts.\u201d 194 U.S. at 167. Explaining that \u201cit is one of \nthe necessities of the administration of justice that \neven fundamental questions should be determined in \nan orderly way,\u201d the Court reasoned that the peti-\ntioner failed to first file an appeal with the Secretary \nof Commerce and Labor. Id. at 168. The Court analo-\ngized the exhaustion requirement to habeas corpus \ncases arising out of state confinement:  \nA familiar illustration is that of a person im-\nprisoned upon criminal process by a state \ncourt, under a state law alleged to be \n\n25 \n \nunconstitutional. If the law is unconstitu-\ntional the prisoner is wrongfully held. Yet, ex-\ncept under exceptional circumstances, the \ncourts of the United States do not interfere by \nhabeas corpus. The prisoner must, in the first \nplace, take his case to the highest court of the \nstate to which he can go, and after that he gen-\nerally is left to the remedy by writ of error if \nhe wishes to bring the case here.  \nId. (citations omitted). Because the petitioner failed to \nfirst resort to his administrative remedy, any attempt \n\u201cto swamp the courts by resort to them in the first in-\nstance[ ] must fail.\u201d Id. at 170; see also id. (\u201c[B]efore \nthe courts can be called upon, the preliminary sifting \nprocess provided by the statutes must be gone through \nwith. Whether after that a further trial may be had \nwe do not decide.\u201d). Other cases highlight exhaustion\u2019s \nequitable origins. E.g. Pittsburgh Ry. v. Bd. of Pub. \nWorks, 172 U.S. 32, 47 (1898); United States v. Abilene \n& S. Ry. Co., 265 U.S. 274, 282 (1924); United States \nv. Ill. Cent. R.R. Co., 291 U.S. 457, 463 (1934); Natural \nGas Pipeline Co. v. Slattery, 302 U.S. 300, 310\u201311 \n(1937).  \nWhile these cases confirm exhaustion\u2019s equitable \norigins, the doctrine, as we understand it today, did \nnot fully emerge until the twentieth century. See John \nF. Duffy, Administrative Common Law in Judicial Re-\nview, 77 Tex. L. Rev. 113, 154 (1998) (explaining that \n\u201c[i]n the early part of th[e] [twentieth] century, the \ndoctrine was still quite amorphous, and as late as the \n1920\u2019s, courts were still using other equitable doc-\ntrines . . . to decide cases that would later be consid-\nered exhaustion precedents\u201d). Indeed, it was only in \n\n26 \n \n1938, in Myers v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Co., 303 \nU.S. 41 (1938), that this Court expressly articulated \nthe modern underpinning of the doctrine. See Duffy, \nsupra, at 155.  \nIn Myers, the Court declined a request to enjoin \nthe National Labor Relations Board\u2019s administrative \nproceedings despite allegations that the NLRB lacked \njurisdiction. Id. at 43, 46. The Court refused to grant \ninjunctive relief, in part on the ground that \u201cno one is \nentitled to judicial relief for a supposed or threatened \ninjury until the prescribed administrative remedy has \nbeen exhausted.\u201d Id. at 50. The Court recognized the \nexhaustion doctrine\u2019s equitable roots, see id. at 51 n.9 \n(\u201cThe rule has been most frequently applied in equity \nwhere relief by injunction was sought\u201d) (citation omit-\nted), and noted the extension of the doctrine to courts \nof law, id. (\u201cbecause the rule is one of judicial admin-\nistration\u2014not merely a rule governing the exercise of \ndiscretion\u2014it is applicable to proceedings at law as \nwell as suits in equity\u201d) (citations omitted). Myers \nstands as \u201cthe seminal decision\u201d on the exhaustion \ndoctrine and has been described as \u201ccomplet[ing] the \ndoctrine\u2019s evolution.\u201d Duffy, supra, at 155. \nIn short, although exhaustion has deep roots in \nequity, the doctrine as we know it today was unknown \nin the late eighteenth century. Consequently, there is \nno \u201cclear historical evidence that the very . . . ques-\ntion\u201d of exhaustion was a question for the jury under \nthe common law. Markman, 517 U.S. at 377. \n\n27 \n \nb. Traditional equitable defenses such as \nadequate remedy at law, forum non \nconveniens, abstention, and habeas \ncorpus bars are an appropriate com-\nmon-law analog for exhaustion.  \nWith no precise analog existing in the English \ncommon law, \u201cthe best hope lies in comparing the \nmodern practice to earlier ones whose allocation to \ncourt or jury we do know, . . . seeking the best analogy \nwe can draw between the old and the new.\u201d Markman, \n517 U.S. at 378 (citations omitted). In this regard, this \nCourt has instructed that the analog be \u201cappropriate\u201d \nrather than \u201cprecise[ ],\u201d Tull, 481 U.S. at 420\u201321, and \ncan be drawn on the basis of function, Markman, 517 \nU.S. at 379\u201380.  \nExhaustion\u2019s foundations in courts of equity pro-\nvide a logical starting point in the search for an appro-\npriate analog. As explained in the prior section, from \nits earliest articulations, it was viewed as a limitation, \nalbeit discretionary, on a court\u2019s equitable jurisdic-\ntion. See Charlton, 32 F. at 195; Altschul, 86 F. at 202. \nIn other words, a court of equity would not exercise its \nextraordinary powers where a plaintiff failed to avail \nitself of an available administrative process. Gorham \nMfg. Co. v. State Tax Comm\u2019n of N.Y., 266 U.S. 265, \n270 (1924) (holding that the petitioner, \u201chaving failed \nto avail itself of the administrative remedy provided \nby the statute . . . was not entitled to maintain a bill \nin equity\u201d); Ill. Cent. R.R. Co., 291 U.S. at 463 (\u201cThe \nvarious steps to be taken constitute parts of the ad-\nministrative process which must be completed before \nthe extraordinary powers of a court of equity may be \ninvoked.\u201d) (citation omitted); Slattery, 302 U.S. 300, \n310\u201311 (1937) (\u201cThe rule that a suitor must exhaust \n\n28 \n \nhis administrative remedies before seeking the ex-\ntraordinary relief of a court of equity . . . is of special \nforce when resort is had to the federal courts to re-\nstrain the action of state officers.\u201d) (citations omitted); \nIsland Creek Coal Co. v. Bryan, 937 F.3d 738, 748 (6th \nCir. 2019) (noting that \u201cthe exhaustion \u2018doctrine had \nits origin in a discretionary rule adopted by courts of \nequity to the effect that a petitioner will be denied eq-\nuitable relief when he has failed to pursue an availa-\nble administrative remedy by which he might obtain \nthe same relief.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting Smith v. United States, \n199 F.2d 377, 381 (1st Cir. 1952)).  \nThus, historically, exhaustion was an equitable \ndefense applied by courts when another forum\u2014an \nadministrative tribunal or agency\u2014was the more ap-\npropriate starting point for a dispute. Tracking this \nprinciple, this Court has said that exhaustion \u201cserves \nthe twin purposes of protecting administrative agency \nauthority and promoting judicial efficiency.\u201d McCar-\nthy v. Madigan, 503 U.S. 140, 145 (1992), superseded \nby statute, \u00a7 1997e(a), as recognized in Woodford, 548 \nU.S. at 84\u201385. As to the first purpose, the exhaustion \nrequirement \u201crecognizes the notion, grounded in def-\nerence to Congress\u2019 delegation of authority to coordi-\nnate branches of Government, that agencies, not the \ncourts, ought to have primary responsibility for the \nprograms that Congress has charged them to admin-\nister.\u201d Id.; see id. (\u201cThe exhaustion doctrine recognizes \nthe commonsense notion of dispute resolution that an \nagency ought to have an opportunity to correct its own \nmistakes . . . before it is haled into federal court.\u201d) (em-\nphasis added); Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 492 \n(1973) (\u201cSince the[ ] internal problems of state prisons \ninvolve issues so peculiarly within state authority and \n\n29 \n \nexpertise, the States have an important interest in not \nbeing bypassed in the correction of those problems.\u201d). \nAs to the second purpose, \u201c[w]hen an agency has the \nopportunity to correct its own errors, a judicial contro-\nversy may well be mooted, or at least piecemeal ap-\npeals may be avoided.\u201d McCarthy, 503 U.S. at 145 (ci-\ntations omitted).  \nThese twin purposes call back to early articula-\ntions of the exhaustion doctrine as a rule of \u201corderly\u201d \nprocedure. Sing Tuck, 194 U.S. at 168, 173. And alt-\nhough the exhaustion doctrine was discretionary, as \nopposed to jurisdictional, Slattery, 302 U.S. at 311 (ex-\nplaining that the rule \u201crests in the sound discretion \nwhich guides exercise of equity jurisdiction\u201d) (cita-\ntions omitted); Abilene & S. Ry. Co., 265 U.S. at 282, \nit nevertheless was treated by courts of equity as a \nthreshold inquiry, see Sing Tuck, 194 U.S. at 168, 170.  \nThese guideposts offer a clear path in the search \nfor an appropriate common law analog. Indeed, ex-\nhaustion\u2019s origins as a forum-based equitable defense \ncall to mind other similar equitable defenses\u2014the ad-\nequate remedy at law doctrine, forum non conveniens, \nabstention, and habeas corpus bars.  \nAdequate remedy at law. The adequate remedy at \nlaw doctrine was a fundamental principle guiding \ncourts of equity. These courts \u201cstood ready to fashion \nremedies for legal wrongs, so long as the basic require-\nments of equity\u2014such as irreparable injury and no \nadequate remedy at law\u2014were met.\u201d Duffy, supra, at \n124. See also Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 43\u201344 \n(1971) (\u201cOne is the basic doctrine of equity jurispru-\ndence that courts of equity should not act . . . when the \nmoving party has an adequate remedy at law and will \n\n30 \n \nnot suffer irreparable injury if denied equitable re-\nlief.\u201d); Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U.S. \n374, 381 (1992) (\u201cIt is a \u2018basic doctrine of equity juris-\nprudence that courts of equity should not act . . . when \nthe moving party has an adequate remedy at law[.]\u2019 \u201d) \n(citations omitted).  \nThe adequate remedy at law doctrine was \ngrounded in comity and federalism concerns, with fed-\neral equity courts refusing to provide relief where it \nwas available at law in federal courts of law, Great \nLakes Co. v. Huffman, 319 U.S. 293, 297 (1943) (cita-\ntion omitted), as well as in state proceedings, Trainor \nv. Hernandez, 431 U.S. 434, 441 (1977). This doctrine, \nlike exhaustion, thus focused on whether a court of eq-\nuity should defer to another court (or forum) to hear \nthe dispute. And, like exhaustion, courts viewed the \ndoctrine as a threshold issue. Brown, Bonnell & Co. v. \nLake Superior Iron Co., 134 U.S. 530, 536 (1890) (ex-\nplaining that the adequate remedy at law objection \n\u201cshould be taken at the earliest opportunity\u201d). \nForum non conveniens. Under this equitable, com-\nmon-law doctrine, a federal court may dismiss an ac-\ntion in favor of an alternative forum when, among \nother things, \u201cthe chosen forum [is] inappropriate be-\ncause of considerations affecting the court\u2019s own ad-\nministration and legal problems.\u201d Koster v. Am. Lum-\nbermens Mut. Cas. Co., 330 U.S. 518, 524 (1947); see \nalso Gulf Oil Corp. v. Gilbert, 330 U.S. 501, 506\u201307 \n(1947) (explaining that the doctrine is premised on the \nassumption that there are \u201cat least two forums in \nwhich the defendant is amenable to process\u201d). Both fo-\nrum non conveniens and exhaustion therefore permit \ncourts to consider judicial efficiency in deciding \n\n31 \n \nwhether they are the appropriate forum for a case to \nbe heard. See Sinochem Int\u2019l Co. v. Malaysia Int\u2019l \nShipping Corp., 549 U.S. 422, 432 (2007) (\u201cA district \ncourt . . . may dispose of an action by a forum non con-\nveniens dismissal, bypassing questions of subject-mat-\nter and personal jurisdiction, when considerations of \nconvenience, fairness, and judicial economy so war-\nrant.\u201d).  \nAbstention. \u201c[E]xhaustion of administrative reme-\ndies\u201d in general and \u201cabstention\u201d are \u201crelated doc-\ntrines.\u201d McCarthy, 503 U.S. at 144. As with exhaus-\ntion, the power of a federal court to dismiss a case via \nabstention \u201cderives from the discretion historically \nenjoyed by courts of equity.\u201d Quackenbush v. Allstate \nIns. Co., 517 U.S. 706, 728 (1996). The driving princi-\nples behind exhaustion and abstention also share a \ncommon root\u2014deference to state or administrative \nauthority. See id. at 728 (quoting Burford v. Sun Oil \nCo., 319 U.S. 315, 334 (1943)). Younger abstention, for \nexample, respects a \u201cState\u2019s interest in pursuing an \nongoing state proceeding,\u201d Ohio Bureau of Emp. \nServs. v. Hodory, 431 U.S. 471, 477 (1977) (citations \nomitted), barring a federal court from enjoining a \nstate prosecution, a civil enforcement action, or a \nunique state action that \u201cimplicate[s] a State\u2019s inter-\nest in enforcing the orders and judgments of its \ncourts,\u201d Sprint Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v. Jacobs, 571 U.S. 69, \n72\u201373 (2013). Likewise, PLRA exhaustion requires a \nfederal court to stay its hand where a state has not \nhad its full opportunity to regulate its own prisons by \nconsidering a prisoner\u2019s grievance. \nHabeas Corpus. Federal habeas principles rein-\nforce the analogy between exhaustion and equitable \n\n32 \n \ndefenses. Indeed, this Court explicitly linked PLRA \nexhaustion requirements to certain habeas defenses, \ndeeming them \u201csubstantively similar.\u201d Woodford, 548 \nU.S. at 92; see also Schlesinger v. Councilman, 420 \nU.S. 738, 756 (1975) (noting that \u201cthe practical consid-\nerations supporting . . . the exhaustion requirement in \nhabeas corpus . . . are similar to those that underlie \nthe requirement of exhaustion of administrative rem-\nedies\u201d) (citation omitted).  \nHabeas exhaustion, like PLRA exhaustion, \nsounds in equity. Withrow v. Williams, 507 U.S. 680, \n699 (1993) (\u201cConcerns for equity and federalism reso-\nnate throughout our habeas jurisprudence.\u201d) (Scalia, \nJ., concurring in part); Erica Hashimoto, Reclaiming \nthe Equitable Heritage of Habeas, 108 Nw. U. L. Rev. \n139, 142 (2013) (habeas defenses \u201cshare features that \ncorrespond with the [habeas] remedy\u2019s historical equi-\ntable origins\u201d). Premised on the same equitable under-\npinnings as administrative exhaustion, habeas ex-\nhaustion requires a prisoner to avail himself of all \n\u201cavailable\u201d state-court remedies before entering fed-\neral court to seek a writ of habeas corpus. 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2254(c); see also O\u2019Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U.S. \n838, 847 (1999). \nThe doctrine of procedural default, 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2254(b)(1)(A), (c), another limitation on habeas re-\nlief, also shares similarities with exhaustion. It pre-\nvents federal court review of a claim that has not been \nproperly presented to the state courts. Woodford, 548 \nU.S. at 92. Procedural default guards against \u201cover-\nturning a state-court conviction without the state \ncourts having had an opportunity to correct the con-\nstitutional violation in the first instance.\u201d Id. (quoting \n\n33 \n \nO\u2019Sullivan, 526 U.S. at 845). That requirement mir-\nrors PLRA exhaustion\u2014giving prison systems the op-\nportunity to correct violations before litigating in fed-\neral court. See Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509, 518\u201319 \n(1982). \n3. Juries did not historically determine \nquestions of fact related to equitable \ndefenses analogous to exhaustion.  \nWith these similarities in mind, these equitable \ndefenses offer a sound analog to exhaustion, and \neighteenth-century practices concerning these de-\nfenses are instructive. It is well understood that a \nplaintiff is not entitled to have a jury determine a dis-\nputed affirmative defense that is equitable in nature. \nLiberty Oil Co. v. Condon Nat\u2019l Bank, 260 U.S. 235, \n242\u201343 (1922) (\u201cThe equitable defense makes the is-\nsue equitable, and it is to be tried to the judge as a \nchancellor.\u201d); Tull, 481 U.S. at 417 (\u201c[T]hose actions \nthat are analogous to 18th-century cases tried in \ncourts of equity . . . do not require a jury trial.\u201d) (cita-\ntion omitted); Granite State Ins. Co. v. Smart Modular \nTechs., 76 F.3d 1023, 1027 (9th Cir. 1996) (\u201cA litigant \nis not entitled to have a jury resolve a disputed affirm-\native defense if the defense is equitable in nature.\u201d) \n(citation omitted); Smith v. World Ins. Co., 38 F.3d \n1456, 1462 (8th Cir. 1994) (\u201c[T]he determination of eq-\nuitable defenses and equitable remedies is a matter \nfor the court to decide, not the jury.\u201d). This was true \neven where an equitable defense was \u201cinterposed in \n[an] action at law,\u201d in which circumstance the equita-\nble defense was generally \u201cfirst . . . disposed of as in a \ncourt of equity, and then, if an issue at law remain[ed], \nit [was] triable to a jury.\u201d Liberty Oil Co., 260 U.S. at \n\n34 \n \n242 (citations omitted). This equity-first order of oper-\nations was laid out by this Court over 100 years ago:  \nThe same order is preserved as under the sys-\ntem of separate courts. If a defendant at law \nhad an equitable defense, he resorted to a bill \nin equity to enjoin the suit at law, until he \ncould make his equitable defense effective by \na hearing before the chancellor. The hearing \non that bill was before the chancellor, and not \nbefore a jury, and, if the prayer of the bill was \ngranted, the injunction against the suit at law \nwas made perpetual, and no jury trial ensued. \nIf the injunction was denied, the suit at law \nproceeded to verdict and judgment. This was \nthe practice in the courts of law and chancery \nin England when our Constitution and the \nSeventh Amendment were adopted, and it is \nin the light of such practice that the Seventh \nAmendment is to be construed. \nId. at 243.  \n* * * \nIn sum, exhaustion was not part of the common \nlaw in 1791, and it has its origins in equity. This his-\ntorical background, along with exhaustion\u2019s func-\ntional similarities to forum-based equitable defenses \nsuch as adequate remedy at law, forum non conven-\niens, abstention, and habeas bars\u2014all historically \nnon-jury issues\u2014leads to the conclusion that the Sev-\nenth Amendment does not require juries to try ex-\nhaustion inquiries.  \n\n35 \n \n4. Functional considerations demon-\nstrate that judges, not juries, should \ndetermine exhaustion questions.  \nEven if history did not provide a clear answer, this \nCourt can, as a last resort, \u201clook elsewhere\u201d\u2015including \nat \u201cstatutory policies\u201d and the respective skills of \njudges and juries\u2015to inform the proper allocation be-\ntween a court or jury for purposes of the Seventh \nAmendment. Markman, 517 U.S. at 384; see also Del \nMonte Dunes, 526 U.S. at 718 (citation omitted). \nBeginning with the statutory policies at issue, the \nPLRA\u2019s statutory history is well documented. \u201cCon-\ngress enacted the [PLRA] . . . in 1996 in the wake of a \nsharp rise in prisoner litigation in the federal courts.\u201d \nWoodford, 548 U.S. at 84 (citing Alexander, 159 F.3d \nat 1324\u201325). The statute thus contains a variety of \ngatekeeping provisions \u201cdesigned to bring this litiga-\ntion under control.\u201d Id. (citations omitted). A \u201ccenter-\npiece\u201d of this effort is the PLRA\u2019s exhaustion require-\nment. Id. (citation omitted). \nThe PLRA\u2019s exhaustion requirement was, \u201cbeyond \ndoubt,\u201d \u201cenacted . . . to reduce the quantity and im-\nprove the quality of prisoner suits[.]\u201d Porter, 534 U.S. \nat 524. To this end, the provision \u201cafford[s] corrections \nofficials time and opportunity to address complaints \ninternally before allowing the initiation of a federal \ncase.\u201d Id. at 525 (emphasis added); see also Woodford, \n548 U.S. at 93 (\u201cThe PLRA attempts to eliminate un-\nwarranted federal-court interference with the admin-\nistration of prisons . . . .\u201d). This might \u201cobviat[e] the \nneed for litigation\u201d in some instances, or it might \u201cfil-\nter out some frivolous claims.\u201d Porter, 534 U.S. at 525 \n(citing Booth, 532 U.S. at 737). For cases that do make \n\n36 \n \nit to court, \u201cadjudication could be facilitated by an ad-\nministrative record that clarifies the contours of the \ncontroversy.\u201d Id. (citing Booth, 532 U.S. at 737); see \nalso Woodford, 548 U.S. at 95 (\u201cWhen a grievance is \nfiled shortly after the event giving rise to the griev-\nance, witnesses can be identified and questioned while \nmemories are still fresh, and evidence can be gathered \nand preserved.\u201d). These goals mirror the purposes of \ntraditional administrative exhaustion\u2014they safe-\nguard \u201cadministrative agency authority and pro-\nmot[e] judicial efficiency.\u201d McCarthy, 503 U.S. at 145.  \nThese goals would be severely undercut if a court \nwere to permit an exhaustion question to go to the \njury. Prison officials would be denied the opportunity \nto address and potentially rectify complaints inter-\nnally. Unexhausted claims could proceed to discovery \nwithout the benefits of full administrative record. \nMost critically, exhaustion questions would require ei-\nther a mini-jury trial before the merits adjudication or \na jury trial heard simultaneously with the merits. In \neither scenario, judicial resources and jurors\u2019 time \nwould be expended on claims that should never have \nreached the courthouse doors. Such a result directly \ncontradicts the PLRA\u2019s aims. \nOn the second point, judges\u2019 established role as \ngatekeepers in prisoner lawsuits supports the conclu-\nsion that judges, not juries, are \u201cbetter suited\u201d to as-\ncertain a prisoner\u2019s compliance with the exhaustion \nrequirement. See Markman, 517 U.S. at 384, 388\u201389 \n(consulting \u201cexisting precedent\u201d and considering \u201cthe \nrelative interpretive skills of judges and juries\u201d); Del \nMonte Dunes, 526 U.S. at 720 (looking to \u201cconsidera-\ntions of process and function\u201d). As explained in Part \n\n37 \n \nI(A), judges routinely resolve threshold issues and act \nas gatekeepers on factual questions that would other-\nwise be presented to the jury. This is especially true \nin PLRA cases, where, due to the sheer volume of pris-\noner lawsuits, Alexander, 159 F.3d at 1324, judges are \nwell-acquainted with the internal operations of prison \nsystems and their multi-level grievance processes. \nThe screening requirement of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A rein-\nforces this notion, as judges already ensure compli-\nance with other aspects of the PLRA. This knowledge \nbase has well prepared the judiciary to settle ques-\ntions surrounding exhaustion under the PLRA. \nThese considerations provide sufficient reason to \ntreat the disposition of questions of fact concerning ex-\nhaustion like many other factfinding responsibilities \nceded to judges in the normal course of litigation.  \nII. The Seventh Amendment does not preserve \nthe right to a jury trial on factual questions \nconcerning exhaustion even when those fac-\ntual questions are intertwined with the un-\nderlying merits. \nAt common law, the Seventh Amendment did not \npreserve the right to a jury trial on equitable defenses \nsuch as exhaustion. Following the merger of the courts \nof law and equity in 1938, however, courts have recog-\nnized that \u201c[d]ifficulties may arise . . . when the legal \nand equitable issues overlap and the evidence is inter-\ntwined.\u201d Danjaq LLC v. Sony Corp., 263 F.3d 942, 962 \n(9th Cir. 2001); Ross v. Bernhard, 396 U.S. 531, 536\u2013\n39 (1970). This Court has held that, as a prudential \nmatter, where factual issues overlap between legal \nand equitable issues, jury-triable issues should \n\n38 \n \ngenerally be prioritized. See, e.g., Beacon Theatres, \n359 U.S. at 510\u201311; Dairy Queen, Inc. v. Wood, 369 \nU.S. 469, 472\u201373 (1962).  \nBut exhaustion remains a threshold precondition \nto suit that, by its nature, must be determined before \nthe merits. With that that order of operation in mind, \nthis Court has applied the Beacon Theatres principle \nonly where an equitable claim could, through collat-\neral estoppel or res judicata, bar a subsequent jury \ntrial on a legal claim. Exhaustion does not present \nsuch a circumstance. And, in any event, this Court has \nconsidered departure from the Beacon Theatres pru-\ndential rule when it would undercut congressional in-\ntent, as it would here. For these reasons, Richards \ndoes not have a jury trial right on factual questions \nconcerning exhaustion\u2014even when those questions \nare intertwined with the merits of his claims.  \nA. Beacon Theatres created a presumption \nthat juries should decide intertwined le-\ngal and equitable issues, but that pre-\nsumption does not apply here.  \nBeacon Theatres stands for the proposition that, \nwhere legal and equitable claims are grounded in the \nsame set of facts, the right to a jury trial on the legal \nclaims should prevail, precluding a prior determina-\ntion of the equitable claims. This \u201cgeneral prudential \nrule,\u201d Parklane Hosiery, 439 U.S. at 334, is primarily \nconcerned with the collateral estoppel or res judicata \neffect that an inverse ordering would present, id. See \nalso Katchen v. Landy, 382 U.S. 323, 339\u201340 (1966) \n(explaining that Beacon Theatres announced an \u201cequi-\ntable doctrine,\u201d not a bright-line rule). Consequently, \n\n39 \n \nall order-of-trial problems should, \u201cwherever possi-\nble,\u201d be resolved in favor of granting a jury trial to pre-\nserve the Seventh Amendment right. Beacon Thea-\ntres, 359 U.S. at 510. The resolution of an exhaustion \nquestion, however, does not present such a scenario.  \nBeacon Theatres involved a dispute between two \ntheatres regarding the validity of contracts in which \nthe film distributors had given one of the theatres, \nFox, the exclusive right to show \u201cfirst run pictures\u201d in \nthe area. Id. at 502. Because another theatre, Beacon, \n\u201cnotified Fox that it considered [the] contracts . . . to \nbe overt acts in violation of antitrust laws,\u201d id., Fox \nfiled suit seeking both declaratory judgment and an \ninjunction against Beacon asserting an antitrust \nclaim against it. Id. at 502\u201303. Beacon then filed a \ncounterclaim and cross-claim that the contracts vio-\nlated antitrust laws and requested treble damages. Id. \nat 503. Despite an issue of common fact among the \ncomplaint and counterclaim and Beacon\u2019s request for \na jury trial on legal issues, the district court ordered \nFox\u2019s claims, which were traditional suits in equity, to \nbe tried by the court before a determination of Bea-\ncon\u2019s claims. Id. at 503\u201304. The court of appeals af-\nfirmed, holding that the district judge could try the \nequitable claim first, even if it might preclude a jury \ntrial on the legal claims. Id. at 505.  \nThis Court disagreed. Reasoning that trying the \nequitable claims first could, by way of collateral estop-\npel or res judicata, bar a subsequent trial on the mer-\nits of Beacon\u2019s legal claims, the Court held that order-\nof-trial problems be resolved in favor of granting a \njury trial unless there are \u201cimperative circumstances, \ncircumstances which in view of the flexible procedures \n\n40 \n \nof the Federal Rules we cannot now anticipate.\u201d Id. at \n508; see id. at 504 (\u201c[I]f Beacon would have been enti-\ntled to a jury trial in a treble damage suit against Fox, \nit cannot be deprived of the right merely because Fox \ntook advantage of the availability of declaratory relief \nto sue Beacon first.\u201d); see also Parklane Hosiery, 439 \nU.S. at 333 (\u201cRecognition that an equitable determi-\nnation could have collateral-estoppel effect in a subse-\nquent legal action was the major premise of . . . Beacon \nTheatres.\u201d).  \nDairy Queen, decided three years later, involved \nsimilar timing concerns. There, the claims were both \nlegal (monetary damages for breach of contract) and \nequitable (relief in the form of injunction), and the dis-\ntrict court denied the defendants\u2019 demand for a jury \ntrial on the ground that the jury claim was only \u201cinci-\ndental\u201d to the non-jury claim. 369 U.S. at 470. This \nCourt, relying on Beacon Theatres, explained that \u201cthe \nright to trial by jury may [not] be lost as to legal issues \nwhere those are characterized as \u2018incidental\u2019 to equi-\ntable issues.\u201d Id. Again, the Court was concerned with \nthe preclusive effect that a determination on equitable \nissues would have on legal ones. Id. at 472\u201373. \nBeacon Theatres is therefore instructive in deter-\nmining the order of trial on merits-based arguments. \nWhere a party has a right to a jury trial on a legal \nclaim, the order of trial should be arranged to preserve \nthat right. This is consistent with \u201c[t]he limitation im-\nposed by the [Seventh] [A]mendment . . . that the ul-\ntimate determination of issues of fact by the jury be \nnot interfered with.\u201d In re Peterson, 253 U.S. at 310 \n(emphasis added); see also Markman, 517 U.S. at 377 \n(asking \u201cwhether a particular issue . . . is itself \n\n41 \n \nnecessarily a jury issue, the guarantee being essential \nto preserve the right to a jury\u2019s resolution of the ulti-\nmate dispute\u201d). \nExhaustion questions, whether intertwined with \nthe merits or not, do not raise the same concerns as \nthose in Beacon Theatres for two interrelated reasons. \nFirst, unlike the substantive claims in Beacon Thea-\ntres, exhaustion is a threshold precondition to reach-\ning the merits. Second, unlike the concerns of collat-\neral estoppel or res judicata in Beacon Theatres, a \njudge\u2019s factual findings on exhaustion would not pre-\nclude a jury\u2019s ability to consider those same facts when \ndetermining the merits of the legal claim.  \n1. The presumption does not apply be-\ncause exhaustion is a threshold issue \nthat is logically precedent to the mer-\nits.  \nBeacon Theatres involved competing causes of ac-\ntion\u2014claims for declaratory and injunctive relief on \nthe one hand and claims for treble damages on the \nother. Under the historical equity-first order of opera-\ntions, see Liberty Oil Co., 260 U.S. at 242, the latter \nmerits claims would have been bound by the determi-\nnation of the former and thus never tried before a jury. \nThis Court held that this would violate the Seventh \nAmendment.  \nNo such scenario is present here. Unlike the \nclaims at issue in Beacon Theatres, exhaustion is a \nthreshold precondition to suit that, by its nature, \nmust be determined before the merits. Given that it is \na rule of \u201corderly\u201d procedure, Sing Tuck, 194 U.S. at \n\n42 \n \n168, \u201c[u]ntil the issue of exhaustion is resolved, a \ncourt cannot know whether it is to decide the case or \nthe prison authorities are to,\u201d Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741. \nSee also Perez v. Wis. Dep\u2019t of Corr., 182 F.3d 532, 534 \n(7th Cir. 1999) (explaining that exhaustion is \u201cde-\nsigned to prevent [a] decision on the merits\u201d). To do \notherwise would flip exhaustion on its head\u2014defer-\nence to agency authority would be bypassed and judi-\ncial efficiency lost. See McCarthy, 503 U.S. at 145; Pe-\nrez, 182 F.3d at 534 (explaining that \u201c[e]xamining the \nmerits first and then ordering a case dismissed on ex-\nhaustion grounds . . . would disregard the statutory \napproach\u201d).  \nBecause exhaustion is a threshold issue, it does \nnot have any bearing on a prisoner\u2019s jury trial right. \nIndeed, \u201c \u2018[t]he Seventh Amendment does not confer \nthe right to a trial, but only the right to have a jury \nhear the case once it is determined that the litigation \nshould proceed before a court.\u2019 \u201d Caley, 428 F.3d at \n1372 (quoting Am. Heritage Life Ins. Co., 294 F.3d at \n711); see also Sydnor v. Conseco Fin. Serv. Corp., 252 \nF.3d 302, 307 (4th Cir. 2001) (same). In contrast to \nBeacon Theatres, in which there were competing equi-\ntable and legal causes of action, exhaustion presents \na threshold precondition to suit. Legal claims that are \nsubject to trial by jury may be tried by that jury only \nafter determination of the threshold issue. Beacon \nTheatres is therefore distinguishable and does not \ncompel a different result.  \n\n43 \n \n2. The presumption does not apply be-\ncause a judge\u2019s factual findings re-\ngarding exhaustion would not pre-\nclude a jury\u2019s consideration of the \nsame facts when determining the \nmerits of the legal claim.  \nThis case differs from Beacon Theatres for a sec-\nond reason. A jury can reexamine factual determina-\ntion made by a judge regarding exhaustion when de-\nciding the merits of the claim.  \nBoth Beacon Theatres and Dairy Queen involved \ncircumstances in which the right to a jury trial on a \nlegal issue would be lost through the determination of \nan equitable issue. And Beacon Theatres itself recog-\nnized that there would be cases in which a trial court \nhas \u201cdiscretion in deciding whether the legal or equi-\ntable cause should be tried first,\u201d 359 U.S. at 510, \nkeeping in mind that this discretion \u201cmust, wherever \npossible, be exercised to preserve jury trial.\u201d Id. See \nalso Markman, 517 U.S. at 377 (asking whether the \njury must hear this question to \u201cpreserve the \u2018sub-\nstance of the common-law right of trial by jury\u2019 \u201d) \n(quoting Tull, 481 U.S. at 426) (emphasis omitted). \nHere, that right can be preserved through a jury\u2019s \nability to reexamine the fact questions common to ex-\nhaustion and the underlying legal claim at trial. As \nexplained in Pavey:  \n[A]ny finding that the judge makes, relating \nto exhaustion, that might affect the merits \nmay be reexamined by the jury if\u2014and only \nafter\u2014the prisoner overcomes the exhaustion \ndefense and the case proceeds to the merits. \n544 F.3d at 742.  \n\n44 \n \nThis approach is consistent with the \u201cflexible\u201d na-\nture of collateral estoppel. Duvall v. Att\u2019y Gen. of the \nUnited States, 436 F.3d 382, 390 (3d Cir. 2006) \n(\u201cCourts and commentators have consistently recog-\nnized that collateral estoppel was borne of equity and \nis therefore \u2018flexible,\u2019 bending to satisfy its underlying \npurpose in light of the nature of the proceedings.\u201d) (ci-\ntation omitted); United States v. Stauffer Chem. Co., \n464 U.S. 165, 176 (1984) (White, J., concurring) (ex-\nplaining that collateral estoppel \u201cis a flexible, judge-\nmade doctrine\u201d). Cf. Parklane Hosiery, 439 U.S. at 331 \n(explaining that trial courts have \u201cbroad discretion\u201d in \ndetermining \nwhen \noffensive \ncollateral \nestoppel \n\u201cshould be applied\u201d). \nPavey\u2019s pragmatic approach disposes of the pri-\nmary concern at issue in Beacon Theatres and Dairy \nQueen\u2014namely, that the \u201cright to a jury trial of legal \nissues [would] be lost through prior determination of \nequitable claims.\u201d 359 U.S. at 511 (citation omitted). \nFollowing Pavey\u2019s approach, \u201c[i]f and when the judge \ndetermines that the prisoner has properly exhausted \nhis administrative remedies, the case will proceed to \npretrial discovery, and if necessary a trial, on the mer-\nits[.]\u201d 544 F.3d at 742; see also id. at 741 (explaining \nthat \u201cin many cases the only consequence of a failure \nto exhaust is that the prisoner must go back to the \nbottom rung of the administrative ladder\u201d).4 Then, \u201cif \nthere is a jury trial, the jury will make all necessary \nfindings of fact without being bound by (or even \n \n4 This approach also allays the concerns in Fireman\u2019s Fund, \nwhich the Sixth Circuit relied on below, that \u201cthe merits of a con-\ntroversy could be summarily decided\u201d \u201cwithout the ordinary inci-\ndents of trial.\u201d 253 F.2d at 784 (citing Smithers v. Smith, 204 \nU.S. 632, 645 (1907)).  \n\n45 \n \ninformed of) any of the findings made by the district \njudge in determining that the prisoner had exhausted \nhis administrative remedies.\u201d5 Id. In short, the \u201csub-\nstance of the common-law right of trial by jury\u201d is pre-\nserved. Colgrove, 413 U.S. at 156.  \nOf course, some prisoners will be unable to refile \ntheir lawsuit after a judge\u2019s determination that they \nfailed to properly exhaust administrative remedies. \nSee Pavey, 544 F.3d at 742 (explaining that where a \njudge decides that \u201cthe failure to exhaust was the pris-\noner\u2019s fault . . . the case is over\u201d). But this is simply a \nconsequence of the exhaustion requirement function-\ning as intended. See, e.g., Woodford, 548 U.S. at 89\u2013\n92 (discussing the purposes of exhaustion); id. at 95 \n(\u201cA prisoner who does not want to participate in the \nprison grievance system will have little incentive to \ncomply with the system\u2019s procedural rules unless non-\ncompliance carries a sanction.\u201d). And again, this con-\nsequence has no bearing on the Seventh Amendment, \nwhich guarantees a jury trial only after it is deter-\nmined that the case belongs in court.  \n \n5 As recognized in Pavey, the ability of a prisoner to refile a case \nafter proper exhaustion \u201cdistinguishes the issue of exhaustion \nfrom [other] deadline lines issues that juries decide.\u201d Id. at 741. \nFor example, \u201c[a] statute of limitations defense if successfully in-\nterposed ends the litigation rather than shunting it to another \nforum.\u201d Id.; see also Messa, 652 F.3d at 309\u201310 (explaining that \nthe doctrines of exhaustion and statutes of limitations \u201cplay . . . \nimportant\u2014and distinct\u2014roles in our system of justice\u201d) (cita-\ntion omitted).  \n\n46 \n \nB. Unlike in Beacon Theatres, a judicial de-\ntermination of exhaustion would imple-\nment congressional intent.  \nEven assuming Beacon Theatres applies generally \nto threshold issues that would not implicate the jury\u2019s \nultimate determination of the merits, its presumption \nshould not apply in the PLRA exhaustion context.  \nPost-Beacon Theatres, this Court has noted the \nlimitations of its order-of-trial presumption. In \nKatchen, for example, the Court explained that \u201c[b]oth \nBeacon Theatres and Dairy Queen recognize that \nthere might be situations in which the Courts could \nproceed to resolve the equitable claims first even \nthough the results might be dispositive of the issues \ninvolved in the legal claim.\u201d 382 U.S. at 339 (emphasis \nadded). The Katchen Court addressed \u201cthe mode of \nprocedure for trying out the issue\u201d of voidable prefer-\nences against an estate in bankruptcy proceedings. \n382 U.S. at 325, 326. Recognizing the equitable juris-\ndiction of bankruptcy courts and the \u201cspecific statu-\ntory scheme contemplating the prompt trial of a dis-\nputed claim but without the intervention of a jury,\u201d \nthis Court permitted a bankruptcy court to decide the \npreference issues in an equitable proceeding notwith-\nstanding the argument that it would \u201crender unneces-\nsary a trial in a [legal] action.\u201d Id. at 336, 339. The \nCourt rejected the petitioner\u2019s reliance on Beacon The-\natres and Dairy Queen, noting that the rule of those \ncases \u201cis itself an equitable doctrine\u201d and that appli-\ncation of the rule would \u201cdismember a scheme which \nCongress has prescribed.\u201d Id. at 339; see also id. at \n339\u201340 (\u201cBoth Beacon Theatres and Dairy Queen rec-\nognize that there might be situations in which the \nCourt could proceed to resolve the equitable claim \n\n47 \n \nfirst even though the results might be dispositive of \nthe issues involved in the legal claim.\u201d); but see Gran-\nfinanciera, 492 U.S. at 58\u201359 (noting the limitations \non the scope of Congress\u2019s ability to \u201cdivest [parties] of \ntheir Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial\u201d).  \nAs in Katchen, this case involves a specific statu-\ntory scheme whose purpose would be compromised ab-\nsent prompt resolution of disputed facts by the court. \nSee Katchen, 383 U.S. at 339. Congress passed the \nPLRA \u201cto reduce the quantity and improve the quality \nof prisoner suits.\u201d Porter, 534 U.S. at 524. The \u201cinvig-\norated\u201d exhaustion requirements is the \u201ccenterpiece\u201d \nof this legislation, Woodford, 548 U.S. at 84, and it \nserves dual purposes. It allows prisons to rectify their \nown mistakes before they are \u201chaled into federal \ncourt,\u201d id. at 89, and promotes judicial efficiency by \nreducing litigation and creating an administrative \nrecord for the litigation that does occur, id. \nAllowing potentially unexhausted claims to pro-\nceed to a jury trial subverts both purposes. See also \nPart I(B)(4). This subversion is further reason why the \nprudential rule set forth in Beacon Theatres should \nnot apply to PLRA exhaustion.  \nThat an exhaustion question is intertwined with \nthe merits of a prisoner\u2019s claim does not transform ex-\nhaustion into a jury-triable issue. Exhaustion is a \nthreshold issue that is logically precedent to the mer-\nits. And Beacon Theatres\u2019 presumption would not ap-\nply where any judicial determination of overlapping \nfacts remains subject to later review by a jury in a trial \non the merits. Finally, that a judicial determination of  \n \n \n\n48 \n \nexhaustion would implement congressional intent \nserves as yet another reason why Beacon Theatres\u2019 \nprudential rule should not apply to exhaustion ques-\ntions. \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be  \nreversed.  \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nAnn M.

Because he \nalleges that their retaliation included destroying his \nprison grievances and preventing him from utilizing \nthe grievance process, the question of whether he \nfailed to exhaust available administrative remedies \nis inextricably intertwined with the core merits of \nhis claim. This is a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim for money \ndamages, so the Seventh Amendment clearly gives \nMr. Richards a right to jury trial on the merits of his \nclaims.  Nonetheless, the magistrate judge conducted \na bench trial, heard evidence from both sides, found \nas a fact that the testimony of Respondent and his \nco-plaintiffs was not credible, and recommended \ndismissal on the ground that they failed to exhaust \navailable \nprison \nremedies. \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt \naccepted that recommendation. \n \nThe Sixth Circuit correctly held that this process \nviolated \nthe \nSeventh \nAmendment, \ngiven \nthe \nsubstantial overlap between the factual disputes \nrelated to exhaustion and the actual merits of \nRichards\u2019 claims. In so doing, and as the petition \nexplains, the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision created an \nacknowledged circuit split with the Seventh Circuit\u2019s \ndecision in Pavey v. Conley, 544 F.3d 739 (7th Cir. \n2008). The en banc Ninth Circuit has also endorsed \nthe relevant holding of Pavey in Albino v. Baca, 747 \nF.3d 1162, 1171 (9th Cir. 2014) (en banc), though the \nSixth Circuit characterized the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \nlanguage as dicta. Pet. App. 14a. On the other side of \n\n2 \n \n \nthe equation, several district courts in the Second \nCircuit have like, the Sixth Circuit, disagreed with \nPavey.  \n \nNonetheless, review of this shallow split would \nbe premature. The Sixth Circuit is clearly right\u2014\nand the Seventh and Ninth Circuits clearly wrong\u2014\non the Seventh Amendment question. Indeed, there \nare strong arguments that the Seventh Amendment \ndoes not permit judicial resolution of facts related to \nexhaustion \neven \nwhen \nthose \nfacts \nare \nnot \nintertwined with the merits. When the facts are \nintertwined, it is black-letter law that judges should \ndefer to juries even as to facts (like amount-in-\ncontroversy) that also bear on subject matter \njurisdiction. Several circuits that generally permit \njudge resolution of exhaustion questions have \nreserved decision on whether a different rule might \nbe necessary when those facts are intertwined with \nthe merits. There is every reason to expect that \nthose circuits will ultimately side with the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s cogent analysis in this case and reject the \nSeventh Circuit\u2019s puzzling and illogical Pavey \ndecision. Indeed the Seventh and Ninth Circuits may \nwell reconsider the question en banc without this \nCourt\u2019s intervention. \n \nThe petition argues at length that convening a \njury to decide factual disputes bearing on exhaustion \nof remedies would defeat Congress\u2019s intent to \nstreamline \nprisoner \nlitigation \nin \nthe \nPrison \nLitigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d). It says time and \nagain that early bench trial resolution of exhaustion \nquestions is necessary to bar \u201cfrivolous claims at the \nearliest possible juncture.\u201d  Pet. at 2; see also id. at 9, \n16. But the PLRA\u2019s actual pre-screening provision, \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, notably does not provide for such \n\n3 \n \n \na procedure. The Sixth Circuit here also ruled that \nRichards\u2019 \u201cserious and detailed allegations cannot \nreasonably be considered frivolous,\u201d Pet. App. 8a, \nand observed that the defendant did \u201cnot directly \ncontest whether his alleged actions were motivated \nby Richards\u2019s protected conduct.\u201d  96 F.4th at 918\u2013\n19.  The petition challenges neither ruling.   \n \nThis Court has repeatedly rejected arguments \nlike these suggesting that the PLRA sets up \nexhaustion as some kind of special and jurisdictional \nprecondition to suit. See, e.g., Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. \n199, 216 (2007) (\u201cfailure to exhaust is an affirmative \ndefense under the PLRA\u201d); see also Woodford v. Ngo, \n548 U.S. 81, 101 (2006) (concluding that \u201cthe PLRA \nexhaustion requirement is not jurisdictional\u201d). The \nproblem of intertwined exhaustion and merits \nfactual disputes also is presented only in a subset of \nPLRA cases.  And in any event the question is not \nwhether jury resolution of disputed facts can be \nsquared with a statute\u2019s purpose, but rather whether \nthat statute\u2019s application can be squared with the \nConstitution. As this Court has repeatedly made \nclear, questions about Congress\u2019s intent must take a \nback-seat to the historic role of the jury at common \nlaw. Yet Michigan would hand Congress the keys to \nthe car and strap the Seventh Amendment to the \nroof. This Court should decline that invitation. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n4 \n \n \nI. THE \nSIXTH \nCIRCUIT\u2019S \nDECISION \nIS \n \nCLEARLY CORRECT \n \nA. \nThe \nSixth \nCircuit \nCorrectly \nRecognized That Facts Intertwined \nWith The Merits Should Always Be \nDecided By Juries  \n \nThe petition argues that a factual dispute about \nexhaustion is just a \u201cthreshold issue to determine \nwhether \na \nprisoner \nhas \nmet \na \nprocedural \nrequirement to take his or her case to a jury,\u201d and \nthat therefore the Seventh Amendment is not \nimplicated by analogy to other threshold issues like \nabstention and venue. Pet. 19. These arguments \nmirror Judge Posner\u2019s \u201cgeneralization\u201d in Pavey that \n\u201c[j]uries decide cases, not issues of judicial traffic \ncontrol.\u201d 544 F.3d at 741. But they bear little \nresemblance to an actual Seventh Amendment \nanalysis. \n \nUnder this Court\u2019s precedents, \u00a7 1983\u2014the \nfoundation of Richards\u2019s action\u2014is clearly analogous \nto causes of action that were \u201ctried at law at the time \nof the founding.\u201d Markman v. Westview Instruments, \nInc., 517 U.S. 370, 376 (1996); City of Monterey v. Del \nMonte Dunes at Monterey, Ltd., 526 U.S. 687, 718 \n(1999). So the precise Seventh Amendment question \nis \u201cwhether the particular trial decision,\u201d a factual \ndispute about exhaustion that overlaps with the \nmerits, \u201cmust fall to the jury in order to preserve the \nsubstance of the common-law right as it existed in \n1791.\u201d Markman, 517 U.S. at 376. To figure that out, \n\u201cwe look to history to determine whether the \nparticular issues, or analogous ones, were decided by \njudge or by jury in suits at common law at the time \n\n5 \n \n \nthe Seventh Amendment was adopted.\u201d Del Monte \nDunes, 526 U.S. at 718. And \u201cwhere history does not \nprovide a clear answer, we look to precedent and \nfunctional considerations.\u201d Id. \nThe Sixth Circuit rightly acknowledged that \nunder this Court\u2019s precedents \u201c\u2018many procedural \ndevices developed since 1791 that have diminished the \ncivil jury\u2019s historic domain,\u2019\u201d such as directed verdicts \nand summary judgment, \u201c\u2018have been found not to be \ninconsistent with the Seventh Amendment.\u2019\u201d Pet. App. \n16a-17a (quoting Parklane Hosiery Co., Inc. v. Shore, \n439 U.S. 322, 336 (1979)). But it then recognized the \nkey distinction between those devices and what \nhappened here: none of them \u201cpermit a judge to decide \ngenuine disputes of material fact at a preliminary \nstage of the case that would normally be reserved for \nthe jury.\u201d Pet. App. 17a. The magistrate judge\u2019s \nfactfinding in this case\u2014including explicit credibility \ndeterminations\u2014directly invaded the merits and \n\u201cstripped [Richards] of his \u2018right to a jury\u2019s resolution \nof the ultimate dispute.\u2019\u201d Pet. App. 17a (quoting \nMarkman, 517 U.S. at 377).  \nTo buttress the point, the Sixth Circuit cited its \nlongstanding holding that factual disputes about the \namount in controversy should be deferred to the jury \non the merits in diversity cases, even though that \nissue also has implications for subject matter \njurisdiction. See Pet. App. 17a-18a; Fireman\u2019s Fund \nInsurance Co v. Railway Express Agency, 253 F.2d \n780 (6th Cir. 1958). Because \u201cFireman\u2019s Fund \nrequires that certain cases be heard and determined \non the merits even when constitutionally implicated \njurisdictional disputes might procedurally terminate \nthe proceedings,\u201d the court explained, \u201cwe are all the \nmore convinced that the result should be the same \n\n6 \n \n \nwhen the lesser concern of an affirmative defense, \nsuch as the PLRA\u2019s requirement to exhaust \nadministrative remedies, implicates the merits of a \nclaim.\u201d Pet. App. 19a. After all, \u201c[u]nlike exhaustion, \nan absence of subject-matter jurisdiction implicates \na federal court\u2019s ability to even hear the case.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 19a. Fireman\u2019s Fund also explains why its \nholding is not inconsistent with the general rule that \njudges ordinarily are allowed to hear evidence and to \ndetermine facts necessary to the court\u2019s jurisdiction: \n\u201csuch hearings usually involve factual issues \npertaining only to the question of jurisdiction, not \nincluding factual issues which would be decisive of \nthe merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claim.\u201d 253 F.2d at 784. \nThe petition criticizes the Sixth Circuit\u2019s reliance \non Fireman\u2019s Fund on the ground that \u201cthe case did \nnot discuss or rely on the Seventh Amendment.\u201d Pet. \n20. That is only superficially true. Fireman\u2019s Fund \nrelied on this Court\u2019s decision in Smithers v. Smith, \n204 U.S. 632 (1907), which similarly held that a \ndispute about amount in controversy should be \ndeferred to a jury trial when that issue is intertwined \nwith the merits. And Smithers clearly does rely on \nSeventh Amendment principles, at least in part. This \nCourt explained that judicial discretion to find \njurisdictional facts \u201cobviously is not unlimited, . . . lest \nunder the guise of determining jurisdiction, the merits \nof the controversy between the parties be summarily \ndecided without the ordinary incidents of a trial, \nincluding the right to a jury.\u201d 204 U.S. at 645 \n(emphasis added). \u201cFor it must not be forgotten,\u201d this \nCourt wrote, \u201cthat where, in good faith, one has \nbrought into court a cause of action which, as stated \nby him, is clearly within its jurisdiction, he has the \nright to try its merits in the manner provided by the \n\n7 \n \n \nConstitution and law, and cannot be compelled to \nsubmit to a trial of another kind.\u201d Id. \nFireman\u2019s Fund also relied on this Court\u2019s \nopinion in Land v. Dollar, 330 U.S. 731 (1947), \nwhich considered a suit by a steamship company\u2019s \nstockholders against the U.S. Maritime Commission \nto recover stock previously given to the Commission. \nThis Court held that the district court erred in \ndeciding a jurisdictional sovereign immunity question, \nbecause \u201cthis is the type of case where the question of \njurisdiction is dependent on decision of the merits.\u201d \n330 U.S. at 735. \u201c[I]f the allegations of the petition \n[were] true, the shares of stock never were property of \nthe United States,\u201d so the district court had \n\u201cjurisdiction to determine its jurisdiction\u201d and should \ninstead have \u201cproceed[ed] to a decision on the merits.\u201d \nId. at 738\u201339. Land v. Dollar does not explicitly \ninvoke the right to jury trial, but the principles it \nrelied on are plainly intended to protect that right. \nIt is longstanding black letter law that \u201c[i]n a case \nin which there is a right to jury trial, a dismissal for \nlack of jurisdiction that improperly summarily decides \nthe substantive issues also violates the parties\u2019 \nSeventh Amendment rights.\u201d 8 Moore\u2019s Federal \nPractice \u00a7 38.34[1][c][i] (3d ed. 2009) (\u201cTrial on Merits \nRequired \nWhen \nJurisdictional \nDetermination \nDepends on Determination of Merits.\u201d).1 Factual \n                                                 \n1 See also 5C Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \n\u00a7 1350 (3d ed. 2004) (\u201cThe court may postpone a decision until \nevidence is submitted at trial if the jurisdictional issue is \nintertwined with the merits of the case.\u201d); Joshua S. Moskovitz, \nNote, The Usual Practice: Raising and Deciding Failure to \nExhaust Administrative Remedies as an Affirmative Defense \nunder the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 31 Cardozo L. Rev. 1859, \n1899 n.248 (2010) (Moskovitz) (collecting sources).  \n\n8 \n \n \nquestions bearing on both personal jurisdiction and \nvenue are also reserved for trial and submitted to the \njury when they are intertwined with the core merits of \nthe case.2 And in the related context of civil actions \npresenting both legal and equitable claims, this Court \nhas consistently held that the jury trial right cannot \n\u201cbe impaired by any blending with a claim, properly \ncognizable at law, of a demand for equitable relief in \naid of the legal action, or during its pendency.\u201d Scott v. \nNeely, 140 U.S. 106, 109\u201310 (1891); see also Ross v. \nBernhard, 396 U.S. 531, 537\u201338, 538 n.10 (1970) \n(\u201c[W]here equitable and legal claims are joined in the \nsame action, [the] right to jury trial on the legal \nclaims . . . must not be infringed.\u201d). \nThe rule that factual issues bearing on the merits \nmust always be decided by a jury has very deep roots. \nAt common law, defendants could dispute a plaintiff\u2019s \ndeclaration (i.e., complaint) by either demurrer or \nplea. John Jay McKelvey, Principles of Common-Law \nPleading \u00a7 93, at 68\u201369 (1894) (McKelvey). A \ndemurrer, like a modern-day 12(b)(6) or purely legal \n12(b)(1) motion, accepted the facts as alleged and \n\u201craise[d] a question of law for the determination of the \ncourt\u201d about the declaration\u2019s sufficiency. Benjamin J. \n                                                 \n2 See, e.g., Brown v. Slenker, 220 F.3d 411, 419 (5th Cir. 2000) \n(\u201c[Personal j]urisdiction remains intertwined with the merits, and \non remand both must be decided at a new trial, based on valid \njury findings.\u201d); Kierulff Assocs. v. Luria Bros. & Co., 240 F. Supp. \n640, 642 (S.D.N.Y. 1965) (\u201cWhere venue and the merits of an \naction are intertwined, it is often better to wait until trial where a \nfull presentation of the issue can be made, rather than rule \npreliminarily on a motion.\u201d); Fastener Corp. v. Spotnails, Inc., 291 \nF. Supp. 974, 976 (N.D. Ill. 1968) (\u201c[T]he venue question merge[d] \nwith the issue of infringement on the merits . . . .\u201d).  \n\n9 \n \n \nShipman, Handbook of Common-Law Pleading \u00a7\u00a7 8\u20139, \nat 28 (3d ed. 1923) (Shipman).  \nAs an alternative to the demurrer, there were \nvarious types of pleas. The plea in traverse denied the \ndeclaration\u2019s factual allegations and triggered a jury \ntrial. \u201cWhere an allegation is traversed, or denied, it is \nevident that a question is at once raised between the \nparties; and it is a question of fact . . . .\u201d Shipman \n\u00a7 167, at 302; see also Richard Ross Perry, Common-\nLaw Pleading: Its History and Principles 179\u201380 \n(1897) (Perry). \u201c[T]he tender and acceptance of an \nissue of fact close[d] all pleading in the action, as there \n[was] then nothing left but a trial, which [disposed] of \nthe action on its merits.\u201d Shipman \u00a7 15, at 32\u201333.  \nThe common law permitted various other types of \npleas\u2014such as a plea in abatement or plea in bar\u2014\nthat might raise legal or factual issues collateral to \nthe merits. But critically, if any such plea actually \ncontradicted the factual allegations of the plaintiff\u2019s \ndeclaration, the common law would have regarded it \nas a traverse and proceeded immediately to a trial by \njury. \u201cThe word traverse . . . is synonymous with the \nword denial. Where the defendant intends to rely for \nhis defense upon the fact that the allegations \ncontained in the declaration as to the subject matter of \nthe action are untrue, he must put in the plea known \nas a traverse.\u201d McKelvey \u00a7 185, at 118; see also Perry, \nat 275. Therefore in a case (like this one) where the \nfacts relevant to a threshold defect were intertwined \nwith the merits, it would not even have been possible \nto frame the issue for a purely judicial decision at \ncommon law. \nThe petition argues that a bench trial before a \nmagistrate judge gave Mr. Richards many of the other \nimportant protections of a trial, such as a right to \n\n10 \n \n \npresent \nevidence \nand \ncross \nexamine \nopposing \nwitnesses. Pet. 20-21. No doubt those rights are \nimportant. But the right to trial by jury in civil cases \nis separately and specially protected by the Seventh \nAmendment. This Court recently recognized that \n\u201cthe right to trial by jury is \u2018of such importance and \noccupies so firm a place in our history and \njurisprudence that any seeming curtailment of the \nright has always been and \u2018should be scrutinized \nwith the utmost case.\u2019\u201d SEC v. Jarkesy, Slip Op. at 7 \n(2024) (quoting Dimick v. Schiedt, 293 U.S. 474, 486 \n(1935)). And that is by no means a newfound \nsentiment: Justice Story once explained that the civil \njury trial right is \u201cjustly dear to the American \npeople. It has always been an object of deep interest \nand solicitude, and every encroachment upon it has \nbeen watched with great jealousy.\u201d Parsons v. \nBedford, Breedlove & Robeson, 28 U.S. 433, 466 \n(1830). The Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision is entirely \nconsistent with that tradition. \n \n \nB. \nThe Seventh Circuit\u2019s Decision In \n \nPavey Makes No Sense  \nThe Seventh and Ninth Circuit decisions, by \ncontrast, do not genuinely grapple with the Seventh \nAmendment problem and clearly get the answer \nwrong.  \nJudge Posner\u2019s opinion in Pavey takes for \ngranted that questions of subject matter jurisdiction \n\u201coften . . . turn[] on factual issues that may be \ngenuinely debatable, but even if so the issues are \nresolved by the judge,\u201d without recognizing that an \nopposite rule applies when jurisdictional facts are \nintertwined with the merits. Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741. \nThe Pavey opinion then leaps from the observation \n\n11 \n \n \nthat judges sometimes are permitted to decide \nquestions of fact relevant to preliminary threshold \nissues to an entirely unwarranted \u201cgeneralization\u201d \nthat juries do not decide any questions that can be \ncharacterized as matters of \u201cjudicial traffic control.\u201d \nId.  \nIn reaching that conclusion, Pavey wrongly \ncharacterizes exhaustion as just an issue of \u201cjudicial \ntraffic control\u201d on the naked assertion that \u201cin many \ncases\u201d exhaustion is simply a question of the choice \nof forum because \u201cthe only consequence of a failure \nto exhaust is that the prisoner must go back to the \nbottom rung of the administrative ladder.\u201d Id. \u201cThat \ndistinguishes the issue of exhaustion from deadline \nissues that juries decide,\u201d the Seventh Circuit \nreasoned, because \u201c[a] statute of limitations defense \nif successfully interposed ends the litigation rather \nthan shunting it to another forum.\u201d The Seventh \nCircuit acknowledged, however, that in that actual \ncase the defendant \u201cwould no longer have any \nadministrative remedies\u201d if the exhaustion issue was \nresolved against him, so the issue was entirely \ndispositive of the merits. Id. Surely this Court \nunderstands that that will almost always be true in \nPLRA cases. Prisons have grievance and appeal \nprocesses with extremely tight filing windows\u2014\nmeasured in days. By the time an exhaustion issue \nis raised in federal court, those deadlines will \ngenerally be years in the past and will make it \nimpossible for the plaintiff to go back and seek \nfurther exhaustion. See Alison M. Mikkor, Correcting \nfor Bias and Blind Spots in PLRA Exhaustion Law, \n21 George Mason L. Rev. 573, 584 (2014) (\u201cIn the \nlast few years, many corrections departments have \nalso reduced the amount of time within which a \n\n12 \n \n \nprisoner must file her initial grievance and any \nsubsequent appeals.  In the light of the deference \nshown to [these internal] rules in the PLRA \nexhaustion analysis, this reduction means that for \nprisoners in some systems there is effectively only a \ntwo- or three-day statute of limitations on their \nconstitutional claims.\u201d) (footnotes omitted).   \nFinally, the Seventh Circuit reasoned that, \u201c[b]y \nanalogy to the cases that require that claims at law \nbe decided before equitable claims when both types \nof claim are presented,\u201d a jury later hearing the case \non the merits would not be bound by any exhaustion \nfindings the judge made. Id. at 742. But as the Sixth \nCircuit correctly explained, that line of reasoning \n\u201crings hollow\u201d because \u201cif the prisoner\u2019s case is \ndismissed for failure to exhaust his or her \nadministrative remedies\u201d then \u201ca jury would never \nbe assembled to resolve the factual disputes\u201d on the \nmerits. Pet. App. 15a. \nIn Albino v. Baca, the en banc Ninth Circuit \nappeared to embrace Pavey, with the court noting \nthat \u201c[w]e agree with the Seventh Circuit that, if a \nfactual finding on a disputed question is relevant \nboth to exhaustion and to the merits, a judge\u2019s \nfinding made in the course of deciding exhaustion is \nnot binding on a jury deciding the merits of the suit.\u201d \n747 F.3d\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Because he \nalleges that their retaliation included destroying his \nprison grievances and preventing him from utilizing \nthe grievance process, the question of whether he \nfailed to exhaust available administrative remedies \nis inextricably intertwined with the core merits of \nhis claim. This is a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim for money \ndamages, so the Seventh Amendment clearly gives \nMr. Richards a right to jury trial on the merits of his \nclaims.  Nonetheless, the magistrate judge conducted \na bench trial, heard evidence from both sides, found \nas a fact that the testimony of Respondent and his \nco-plaintiffs was not credible, and recommended \ndismissal on the ground that they failed to exhaust \navailable \nprison \nremedies. \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt \naccepted that recommendation. \n \nThe Sixth Circuit correctly held that this process \nviolated \nthe \nSeventh \nAmendment, \ngiven \nthe \nsubstantial overlap between the factual disputes \nrelated to exhaustion and the actual merits of \nRichards\u2019 claims. In so doing, and as the petition \nexplains, the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision created an \nacknowledged circuit split with the Seventh Circuit\u2019s \ndecision in Pavey v. Conley, 544 F.3d 739 (7th Cir. \n2008). The en banc Ninth Circuit has also endorsed \nthe relevant holding of Pavey in Albino v. Baca, 747 \nF.3d 1162, 1171 (9th Cir. 2014) (en banc), though the \nSixth Circuit characterized the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \nlanguage as dicta. Pet. App. 14a. On the other side of \n\n2 \n \n \nthe equation, several district courts in the Second \nCircuit have like, the Sixth Circuit, disagreed with \nPavey.  \n \nNonetheless, review of this shallow split would \nbe premature. The Sixth Circuit is clearly right\u2014\nand the Seventh and Ninth Circuits clearly wrong\u2014\non the Seventh Amendment question. Indeed, there \nare strong arguments that the Seventh Amendment \ndoes not permit judicial resolution of facts related to \nexhaustion \neven \nwhen \nthose \nfacts \nare \nnot \nintertwined with the merits. When the facts are \nintertwined, it is black-letter law that judges should \ndefer to juries even as to facts (like amount-in-\ncontroversy) that also bear on subject matter \njurisdiction. Several circuits that generally permit \njudge resolution of exhaustion questions have \nreserved decision on whether a different rule might \nbe necessary when those facts are intertwined with \nthe merits. There is every reason to expect that \nthose circuits will ultimately side with the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s cogent analysis in this case and reject the \nSeventh Circuit\u2019s puzzling and illogical Pavey \ndecision. Indeed the Seventh and Ninth Circuits may \nwell reconsider the question en banc without this \nCourt\u2019s intervention. \n \nThe petition argues at length that convening a \njury to decide factual disputes bearing on exhaustion \nof remedies would defeat Congress\u2019s intent to \nstreamline \nprisoner \nlitigation \nin \nthe \nPrison \nLitigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d). It says time and \nagain that early bench trial resolution of exhaustion \nquestions is necessary to bar \u201cfrivolous claims at the \nearliest possible juncture.\u201d  Pet. at 2; see also id. at 9, \n16. But the PLRA\u2019s actual pre-screening provision, \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, notably does not provide for such \n\n3 \n \n \na procedure. The Sixth Circuit here also ruled that \nRichards\u2019 \u201cserious and detailed allegations cannot \nreasonably be considered frivolous,\u201d Pet. App. 8a, \nand observed that the defendant did \u201cnot directly \ncontest whether his alleged actions were motivated \nby Richards\u2019s protected conduct.\u201d  96 F.4th at 918\u2013\n19.  The petition challenges neither ruling.   \n \nThis Court has repeatedly rejected arguments \nlike these suggesting that the PLRA sets up \nexhaustion as some kind of special and jurisdictional \nprecondition to suit. See, e.g., Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. \n199, 216 (2007) (\u201cfailure to exhaust is an affirmative \ndefense under the PLRA\u201d); see also Woodford v. Ngo, \n548 U.S. 81, 101 (2006) (concluding that \u201cthe PLRA \nexhaustion requirement is not jurisdictional\u201d). The \nproblem of intertwined exhaustion and merits \nfactual disputes also is presented only in a subset of \nPLRA cases.  And in any event the question is not \nwhether jury resolution of disputed facts can be \nsquared with a statute\u2019s purpose, but rather whether \nthat statute\u2019s application can be squared with the \nConstitution. As this Court has repeatedly made \nclear, questions about Congress\u2019s intent must take a \nback-seat to the historic role of the jury at common \nlaw. Yet Michigan would hand Congress the keys to \nthe car and strap the Seventh Amendment to the \nroof. This Court should decline that invitation. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n4 \n \n \nI. THE \nSIXTH \nCIRCUIT\u2019S \nDECISION \nIS \n \nCLEARLY CORRECT \n \nA. \nThe \nSixth \nCircuit \nCorrectly \nRecognized That Facts Intertwined \nWith The Merits Should Always Be \nDecided By Juries  \n \nThe petition argues that a factual dispute about \nexhaustion is just a \u201cthreshold issue to determine \nwhether \na \nprisoner \nhas \nmet \na \nprocedural \nrequirement to take his or her case to a jury,\u201d and \nthat therefore the Seventh Amendment is not \nimplicated by analogy to other threshold issues like \nabstention and venue. Pet. 19. These arguments \nmirror Judge Posner\u2019s \u201cgeneralization\u201d in Pavey that \n\u201c[j]uries decide cases, not issues of judicial traffic \ncontrol.\u201d 544 F.3d at 741. But they bear little \nresemblance to an actual Seventh Amendment \nanalysis. \n \nUnder this Court\u2019s precedents, \u00a7 1983\u2014the \nfoundation of Richards\u2019s action\u2014is clearly analogous \nto causes of action that were \u201ctried at law at the time \nof the founding.\u201d Markman v. Westview Instruments, \nInc., 517 U.S. 370, 376 (1996); City of Monterey v. Del \nMonte Dunes at Monterey, Ltd., 526 U.S. 687, 718 \n(1999). So the precise Seventh Amendment question \nis \u201cwhether the particular trial decision,\u201d a factual \ndispute about exhaustion that overlaps with the \nmerits, \u201cmust fall to the jury in order to preserve the \nsubstance of the common-law right as it existed in \n1791.\u201d Markman, 517 U.S. at 376. To figure that out, \n\u201cwe look to history to determine whether the \nparticular issues, or analogous ones, were decided by \njudge or by jury in suits at common law at the time \n\n5 \n \n \nthe Seventh Amendment was adopted.\u201d Del Monte \nDunes, 526 U.S. at 718. And \u201cwhere history does not \nprovide a clear answer, we look to precedent and \nfunctional considerations.\u201d Id. \nThe Sixth Circuit rightly acknowledged that \nunder this Court\u2019s precedents \u201c\u2018many procedural \ndevices developed since 1791 that have diminished the \ncivil jury\u2019s historic domain,\u2019\u201d such as directed verdicts \nand summary judgment, \u201c\u2018have been found not to be \ninconsistent with the Seventh Amendment.\u2019\u201d Pet. App. \n16a-17a (quoting Parklane Hosiery Co., Inc. v. Shore, \n439 U.S. 322, 336 (1979)). But it then recognized the \nkey distinction between those devices and what \nhappened here: none of them \u201cpermit a judge to decide \ngenuine disputes of material fact at a preliminary \nstage of the case that would normally be reserved for \nthe jury.\u201d Pet. App. 17a. The magistrate judge\u2019s \nfactfinding in this case\u2014including explicit credibility \ndeterminations\u2014directly invaded the merits and \n\u201cstripped [Richards] of his \u2018right to a jury\u2019s resolution \nof the ultimate dispute.\u2019\u201d Pet. App. 17a (quoting \nMarkman, 517 U.S. at 377).  \nTo buttress the point, the Sixth Circuit cited its \nlongstanding holding that factual disputes about the \namount in controversy should be deferred to the jury \non the merits in diversity cases, even though that \nissue also has implications for subject matter \njurisdiction. See Pet. App. 17a-18a; Fireman\u2019s Fund \nInsurance Co v. Railway Express Agency, 253 F.2d \n780 (6th Cir. 1958). Because \u201cFireman\u2019s Fund \nrequires that certain cases be heard and determined \non the merits even when constitutionally implicated \njurisdictional disputes might procedurally terminate \nthe proceedings,\u201d the court explained, \u201cwe are all the \nmore convinced that the result should be the same \n\n6 \n \n \nwhen the lesser concern of an affirmative defense, \nsuch as the PLRA\u2019s requirement to exhaust \nadministrative remedies, implicates the merits of a \nclaim.\u201d Pet. App. 19a. After all, \u201c[u]nlike exhaustion, \nan absence of subject-matter jurisdiction implicates \na federal court\u2019s ability to even hear the case.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 19a. Fireman\u2019s Fund also explains why its \nholding is not inconsistent with the general rule that \njudges ordinarily are allowed to hear evidence and to \ndetermine facts necessary to the court\u2019s jurisdiction: \n\u201csuch hearings usually involve factual issues \npertaining only to the question of jurisdiction, not \nincluding factual issues which would be decisive of \nthe merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claim.\u201d 253 F.2d at 784. \nThe petition criticizes the Sixth Circuit\u2019s reliance \non Fireman\u2019s Fund on the ground that \u201cthe case did \nnot discuss or rely on the Seventh Amendment.\u201d Pet. \n20. That is only superficially true. Fireman\u2019s Fund \nrelied on this Court\u2019s decision in Smithers v. Smith, \n204 U.S. 632 (1907), which similarly held that a \ndispute about amount in controversy should be \ndeferred to a jury trial when that issue is intertwined \nwith the merits. And Smithers clearly does rely on \nSeventh Amendment principles, at least in part. This \nCourt explained that judicial discretion to find \njurisdictional facts \u201cobviously is not unlimited, . . . lest \nunder the guise of determining jurisdiction, the merits \nof the controversy between the parties be summarily \ndecided without the ordinary incidents of a trial, \nincluding the right to a jury.\u201d 204 U.S. at 645 \n(emphasis added). \u201cFor it must not be forgotten,\u201d this \nCourt wrote, \u201cthat where, in good faith, one has \nbrought into court a cause of action which, as stated \nby him, is clearly within its jurisdiction, he has the \nright to try its merits in the manner provided by the \n\n7 \n \n \nConstitution and law, and cannot be compelled to \nsubmit to a trial of another kind.\u201d Id. \nFireman\u2019s Fund also relied on this Court\u2019s \nopinion in Land v. Dollar, 330 U.S. 731 (1947), \nwhich considered a suit by a steamship company\u2019s \nstockholders against the U.S. Maritime Commission \nto recover stock previously given to the Commission. \nThis Court held that the district court erred in \ndeciding a jurisdictional sovereign immunity question, \nbecause \u201cthis is the type of case where the question of \njurisdiction is dependent on decision of the merits.\u201d \n330 U.S. at 735. \u201c[I]f the allegations of the petition \n[were] true, the shares of stock never were property of \nthe United States,\u201d so the district court had \n\u201cjurisdiction to determine its jurisdiction\u201d and should \ninstead have \u201cproceed[ed] to a decision on the merits.\u201d \nId. at 738\u201339. Land v. Dollar does not explicitly \ninvoke the right to jury trial, but the principles it \nrelied on are plainly intended to protect that right. \nIt is longstanding black letter law that \u201c[i]n a case \nin which there is a right to jury trial, a dismissal for \nlack of jurisdiction that improperly summarily decides \nthe substantive issues also violates the parties\u2019 \nSeventh Amendment rights.\u201d 8 Moore\u2019s Federal \nPractice \u00a7 38.34[1][c][i] (3d ed. 2009) (\u201cTrial on Merits \nRequired \nWhen \nJurisdictional \nDetermination \nDepends on Determination of Merits.\u201d).1 Factual \n                                                 \n1 See also 5C Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \n\u00a7 1350 (3d ed. 2004) (\u201cThe court may postpone a decision until \nevidence is submitted at trial if the jurisdictional issue is \nintertwined with the merits of the case.\u201d); Joshua S. Moskovitz, \nNote, The Usual Practice: Raising and Deciding Failure to \nExhaust Administrative Remedies as an Affirmative Defense \nunder the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 31 Cardozo L. Rev. 1859, \n1899 n.248 (2010) (Moskovitz) (collecting sources).  \n\n8 \n \n \nquestions bearing on both personal jurisdiction and \nvenue are also reserved for trial and submitted to the \njury when they are intertwined with the core merits of \nthe case.2 And in the related context of civil actions \npresenting both legal and equitable claims, this Court \nhas consistently held that the jury trial right cannot \n\u201cbe impaired by any blending with a claim, properly \ncognizable at law, of a demand for equitable relief in \naid of the legal action, or during its pendency.\u201d Scott v. \nNeely, 140 U.S. 106, 109\u201310 (1891); see also Ross v. \nBernhard, 396 U.S. 531, 537\u201338, 538 n.10 (1970) \n(\u201c[W]here equitable and legal claims are joined in the \nsame action, [the] right to jury trial on the legal \nclaims . . . must not be infringed.\u201d). \nThe rule that factual issues bearing on the merits \nmust always be decided by a jury has very deep roots. \nAt common law, defendants could dispute a plaintiff\u2019s \ndeclaration (i.e., complaint) by either demurrer or \nplea. John Jay McKelvey, Principles of Common-Law \nPleading \u00a7 93, at 68\u201369 (1894) (McKelvey). A \ndemurrer, like a modern-day 12(b)(6) or purely legal \n12(b)(1) motion, accepted the facts as alleged and \n\u201craise[d] a question of law for the determination of the \ncourt\u201d about the declaration\u2019s sufficiency. Benjamin J. \n                                                 \n2 See, e.g., Brown v. Slenker, 220 F.3d 411, 419 (5th Cir. 2000) \n(\u201c[Personal j]urisdiction remains intertwined with the merits, and \non remand both must be decided at a new trial, based on valid \njury findings.\u201d); Kierulff Assocs. v. Luria Bros. & Co., 240 F. Supp. \n640, 642 (S.D.N.Y. 1965) (\u201cWhere venue and the merits of an \naction are intertwined, it is often better to wait until trial where a \nfull presentation of the issue can be made, rather than rule \npreliminarily on a motion.\u201d); Fastener Corp. v. Spotnails, Inc., 291 \nF. Supp. 974, 976 (N.D. Ill. 1968) (\u201c[T]he venue question merge[d] \nwith the issue of infringement on the merits . . . .\u201d).  \n\n9 \n \n \nShipman, Handbook of Common-Law Pleading \u00a7\u00a7 8\u20139, \nat 28 (3d ed. 1923) (Shipman).  \nAs an alternative to the demurrer, there were \nvarious types of pleas. The plea in traverse denied the \ndeclaration\u2019s factual allegations and triggered a jury \ntrial. \u201cWhere an allegation is traversed, or denied, it is \nevident that a question is at once raised between the \nparties; and it is a question of fact . . . .\u201d Shipman \n\u00a7 167, at 302; see also Richard Ross Perry, Common-\nLaw Pleading: Its History and Principles 179\u201380 \n(1897) (Perry). \u201c[T]he tender and acceptance of an \nissue of fact close[d] all pleading in the action, as there \n[was] then nothing left but a trial, which [disposed] of \nthe action on its merits.\u201d Shipman \u00a7 15, at 32\u201333.  \nThe common law permitted various other types of \npleas\u2014such as a plea in abatement or plea in bar\u2014\nthat might raise legal or factual issues collateral to \nthe merits. But critically, if any such plea actually \ncontradicted the factual allegations of the plaintiff\u2019s \ndeclaration, the common law would have regarded it \nas a traverse and proceeded immediately to a trial by \njury. \u201cThe word traverse . . . is synonymous with the \nword denial. Where the defendant intends to rely for \nhis defense upon the fact that the allegations \ncontained in the declaration as to the subject matter of \nthe action are untrue, he must put in the plea known \nas a traverse.\u201d McKelvey \u00a7 185, at 118; see also Perry, \nat 275. Therefore in a case (like this one) where the \nfacts relevant to a threshold defect were intertwined \nwith the merits, it would not even have been possible \nto frame the issue for a purely judicial decision at \ncommon law. \nThe petition argues that a bench trial before a \nmagistrate judge gave Mr. Richards many of the other \nimportant protections of a trial, such as a right to \n\n10 \n \n \npresent \nevidence \nand \ncross \nexamine \nopposing \nwitnesses. Pet. 20-21. No doubt those rights are \nimportant. But the right to trial by jury in civil cases \nis separately and specially protected by the Seventh \nAmendment. This Court recently recognized that \n\u201cthe right to trial by jury is \u2018of such importance and \noccupies so firm a place in our history and \njurisprudence that any seeming curtailment of the \nright has always been and \u2018should be scrutinized \nwith the utmost case.\u2019\u201d SEC v. Jarkesy, Slip Op. at 7 \n(2024) (quoting Dimick v. Schiedt, 293 U.S. 474, 486 \n(1935)). And that is by no means a newfound \nsentiment: Justice Story once explained that the civil \njury trial right is \u201cjustly dear to the American \npeople. It has always been an object of deep interest \nand solicitude, and every encroachment upon it has \nbeen watched with great jealousy.\u201d Parsons v. \nBedford, Breedlove & Robeson, 28 U.S. 433, 466 \n(1830). The Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision is entirely \nconsistent with that tradition. \n \n \nB. \nThe Seventh Circuit\u2019s Decision In \n \nPavey Makes No Sense  \nThe Seventh and Ninth Circuit decisions, by \ncontrast, do not genuinely grapple with the Seventh \nAmendment problem and clearly get the answer \nwrong.  \nJudge Posner\u2019s opinion in Pavey takes for \ngranted that questions of subject matter jurisdiction \n\u201coften . . . turn[] on factual issues that may be \ngenuinely debatable, but even if so the issues are \nresolved by the judge,\u201d without recognizing that an \nopposite rule applies when jurisdictional facts are \nintertwined with the merits. Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741. \nThe Pavey opinion then leaps from the observation \n\n11 \n \n \nthat judges sometimes are permitted to decide \nquestions of fact relevant to preliminary threshold \nissues to an entirely unwarranted \u201cgeneralization\u201d \nthat juries do not decide any questions that can be \ncharacterized as matters of \u201cjudicial traffic control.\u201d \nId.  \nIn reaching that conclusion, Pavey wrongly \ncharacterizes exhaustion as just an issue of \u201cjudicial \ntraffic control\u201d on the naked assertion that \u201cin many \ncases\u201d exhaustion is simply a question of the choice \nof forum because \u201cthe only consequence of a failure \nto exhaust is that the prisoner must go back to the \nbottom rung of the administrative ladder.\u201d Id. \u201cThat \ndistinguishes the issue of exhaustion from deadline \nissues that juries decide,\u201d the Seventh Circuit \nreasoned, because \u201c[a] statute of limitations defense \nif successfully interposed ends the litigation rather \nthan shunting it to another forum.\u201d The Seventh \nCircuit acknowledged, however, that in that actual \ncase the defendant \u201cwould no longer have any \nadministrative remedies\u201d if the exhaustion issue was \nresolved against him, so the issue was entirely \ndispositive of the merits. Id. Surely this Court \nunderstands that that will almost always be true in \nPLRA cases. Prisons have grievance and appeal \nprocesses with extremely tight filing windows\u2014\nmeasured in days. By the time an exhaustion issue \nis raised in federal court, those deadlines will \ngenerally be years in the past and will make it \nimpossible for the plaintiff to go back and seek \nfurther exhaustion. See Alison M. Mikkor, Correcting \nfor Bias and Blind Spots in PLRA Exhaustion Law, \n21 George Mason L. Rev. 573, 584 (2014) (\u201cIn the \nlast few years, many corrections departments have \nalso reduced the amount of time within which a \n\n12 \n \n \nprisoner must file her initial grievance and any \nsubsequent appeals.  In the light of the deference \nshown to [these internal] rules in the PLRA \nexhaustion analysis, this reduction means that for \nprisoners in some systems there is effectively only a \ntwo- or three-day statute of limitations on their \nconstitutional claims.\u201d) (footnotes omitted).   \nFinally, the Seventh Circuit reasoned that, \u201c[b]y \nanalogy to the cases that require that claims at law \nbe decided before equitable claims when both types \nof claim are presented,\u201d a jury later hearing the case \non the merits would not be bound by any exhaustion \nfindings the judge made. Id. at 742. But as the Sixth \nCircuit correctly explained, that line of reasoning \n\u201crings hollow\u201d because \u201cif the prisoner\u2019s case is \ndismissed for failure to exhaust his or her \nadministrative remedies\u201d then \u201ca jury would never \nbe assembled to resolve the factual disputes\u201d on the \nmerits. Pet. App. 15a. \nIn Albino v. Baca, the en banc Ninth Circuit \nappeared to embrace Pavey, with the court noting \nthat \u201c[w]e agree with the Seventh Circuit that, if a \nfactual finding on a disputed question is relevant \nboth to exhaustion and to the merits, a judge\u2019s \nfinding made in the course of deciding exhaustion is \nnot binding on a jury deciding the merits of the suit.\u201d \n747 F.3d at 1171. But the claims at issue in Albino \ndid not actually implicate the underlying merits, and \nelsewhere in its opinion the Ninth Circuit used less \ndefinitive language:  \u201cExhaustion should be decided, \nif feasible, before reaching the merits of a prisoner's \nclaim.\u201d  Id. (emphasis added); see also id. (\u201cWe \nreiterate that, if feasible, disputed factual questions \nrelevant to exhaustion should be decided at the very \nbeginning of the litigation.\u201d). Now that the Sixth \n\n13 \n \n \nCircuit has explained the flaws in the Seventh \nCircuit\u2019s reasoning it seems unlikely that other \ncircuits will follow along. Indeed, there is reason to \nhope that the Seventh and Ninth Circuits will \nreconsider their position en banc without a need for \nthis Court\u2019s intervention.  \nThis \nCourt \nalso \nmay \nbenefit \nfrom \nmore \npercolation. Among the courts of appeals, only the \nSixth and Seventh Circuits have addressed the issue \npresented head-on. Several district courts in the \nSecond Circuit have parted ways with Pavey. Other \ncircuits have identified the problem as well and will \nalmost certainly in due course wrestle with it more \nfully. See Small v. Camden County, 728 F.3d 265, \n270 (3d Cir. 2013) (\u201c[T]he Seventh Amendment is not \nimplicated as long as the facts are not bound up with \nthe merits of the underlying dispute.\u201d); Messa v. \nGoord, 652 F.3d 305, 309 (2d Cir. 2011) (\u201c[T]he \nfactual disputes relating to exhaustion are not \nintertwined with the merits . . . .\u201d); Dillon v. Rogers, \n596 F.3d 260, 272 n.2 (5th Cir. 2010) (\u201cWe do not \ndetermine today who should serve as factfinder \nwhen facts concerning exhaustion also go to the \nmerits of a prisoner\u2019s claim.\u201d). And, given the \nfavorable decision in the Sixth Circuit, prisoners will \nbe more likely to raise the issue going forward. \n \nC. \nExhaustion \nFacts \nShould \nBe \nDecided By Juries Even When They \nAre Not Intertwined With The \nMerits \n \nThe Sixth Circuit decided this case against the \nbackdrop of its own precedent holding that facts \nrelated to exhaustion can be resolved by judges when \n\n14 \n \n \nthey are not intertwined with the merits. That \nassumption is widely shared by the lower courts. \nAlthough it is not necessary to reach the issue in this \ncase, the Court should understand that that \nassumption is probably wrong. The reason goes back \nto the issue the Seventh Circuit failed to wrestle \nwith in Pavey: that a finding of non-exhaustion in \nthe PLRA context will almost always bar the claim \nforever. \nRecall that at common law a defendant who \ncould not or chose not to demur could either file a \ntraverse or a plea. There were a variety of pleas, but \nthe most common were \u201cpleas in abatement\u201d and \n\u201cpleas in bar.\u201d The plea in abatement was one of the \n\u201cdilatory pleas,\u201d which raised a class of common law \ndefenses that merely \u201cdelay[ed] the plaintiff\u2019s action \ninstead of dealing with the merits of his claim.\u201d \nGeorge L. Clark, Common Law Pleading \u00a7 59, at 131 \n(1931) (Clark); McKelvey \u00a7 132, at 93 (\u201cJudgment \nupon the dilatory plea was not final, . . . it did not \ndetermine the case upon the merits.\u201d).3 A plea in \nabatement, if successful, \u201cdispose[d] of the particular \nsuit\u201d but allowed the plaintiff to \u201ccommence anew \nupon the same cause of action in the same court\u201d so \nlong as the plaintiff avoided the mistake that caused \nthe original abating. McKelvey \u00a7 131, at 92. Typically, \na plea in abatement related to the parties\u2019 identities, a \nmisnomer in the declaration of facts, or a defect in the \n                                                 \n3 The other dilatory pleas were pleas to the jurisdiction and pleas \nin suspension of the action. Clark \u00a7 59, at 132. Pleas to the \njurisdiction attacked a court\u2019s subject matter or personal \njurisdiction, disposing of the case entirely before that court if \nsuccessful. McKelvey \u00a7\u00a7 131, 134, at 92, 95. Pleas in suspension of \nthe action sought to identify the plaintiff\u2019s temporary incapacity \nto bring suit. Id. \u00a7 131, at 92; Clark \u00a7 60, at 134; Shipman \u00a7 230, \nat 400. \n\n15 \n \n \nplaintiff\u2019s writ. Id. \u00a7\u00a7 134\u2013135, at 95; Moskovitz, at \n1885. Defects in the plaintiff\u2019s writ included \u201cwrong \nvenue,\u201d that the \u201caction was brought prematurely,\u201d \nthat \u201cthe same claim was pending in another court,\u201d \nthat \u201cthe parties were misnamed,\u201d or that \u201ca \nnecessary party was not joined or . . . was misjoined.\u201d \nMoskovitz, at 1885.  \nMany lower courts have broadly analogized \nexhaustion of administrative remedies to the old \nplea in abatement, and held that there is no Seventh \nAmendment right to jury factfinding because \nsupposedly factual disputes relevant to a plea in \nabatement were resolved by judges. See, e.g., Bryant \nv. Rich, 530 F.3d 1368, 1374 (11th Cir. 2008) \n(\u201cExhaustion of administrative remedies is a matter \nin abatement, and ordinarily does not deal with the \nmerits.\u201d (cleaned up) (quoting 5C Wright & Miller \n\u00a7 1360, at 78 n.15)); Albino, 747 F.3d at 1168. That \nassumption is actually disputed by scholars.4 \nRegardless, the analogy is wrong. The dilatory pleas \n(including abatement) \u201cdid not determine the case \nupon the merits.\u201d McKelvey \u00a7 132, at 93. A plea in \nabatement merely \u201cdelay[ed] the plaintiff\u2019s action \ninstead of dealing with the merits of his claim.\u201d Clark \n\u00a7 59, at 131. By definition, therefore, a plea in \nabatement could not present an argument that the \n                                                 \n4 Pleas in abatement typically tendered an issue of law properly \n\u201celiminated on demurrer\u201d by the judge. A.C. Umbreit, Outline \nof the Law of Common Law Pleading, 4 Marq. L. Rev. 130, 133 \n(1920). But if the plaintiff did not demur, \u201c[t]here is extensive \nhistorical support that a factual dispute on a matter in \nabatement \n[could \nalso \nbe] \ndecided \nby \nthe \njury . . . as \ndocumented in civil cases, in criminal cases, and in numerous \ntreatises.\u201d Moskovitz, at 1896 & nn.234\u201336 (collecting sources \nsupporting jury resolution of fact disputes posed by various \ndilatory pleas). \n\n16 \n \n \nplaintiff\u2019s claim was permanently barred. Matters in \nabatement \u201ccould only go so far as to defeat the \npresent action, and not to demonstrate that the \nplaintiff was permanently disabled from bringing the \nclaim.\u201d Moskovitz, at 1886. Any plea in abatement \nbased on a prematurity defect necessarily alleged that \nthe action was curably premature. See, e.g., Shipman \n\u00a7 225, at 390 n.18 (citing Grand Lodge Bhd. of R.R. \nTrainmen v. Randolph, 57 N.E. 882 (1900), as an \nexample of a plea in abatement alleging \u201cfailure to \nexhaust remedies provided in [a] contract\u201d). Again, \nhowever, in most PLRA cases the very short prison \ngrievance timelines will have expired long before suit \nso a finding of non-exhaustion will permanently bar \nthe claim. \nIn common law terms, an affirmative defense that \nwould permanently end the litigation would have been \nraised by a \u201cplea in bar,\u201d and specifically a variant \ncalled a plea \u201cin discharge.\u201d Pleas in bar could be pled \nnegatively, as a traverse denying the factual \nallegations, or affirmatively, as a confession and \navoidance admitting the facts but denying their legal \neffect by alleging new facts. Shipman \u00a7 197\u2013199, at \n348. Pleas in confession and avoidance were divided \ninto two categories: pleas in justification or excuse and \npleas in discharge. Id. Pleas in discharge included \nbankruptcy, release, payment, and the statute of \nlimitations\u2014all of which alleged that the plaintiff\u2019s \ncause of action had \u201cbeen discharged by some matter \nsubsequent, either of fact or of law.\u201d Id \u00a7 198(b), at \n348; id. \u00a7 199, at 350; cf. Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c)(1). \nLike a statute of limitations issue, an exhaustion \ndefect arises after a \u00a7 1983 claim accrues and \ntherefore is more analogous to a matter in discharge \nthan in abatement. And a judge would never have \n\n17 \n \n \ndecided disputed facts posed by a plea in discharge. If \nthe plea contained a traverse disputing the plaintiff\u2019s \nfacts, the issue was joined and a jury trial was \ntriggered. If the plea was instead framed as a \nconfession and avoidance, then the ball was in the \nplaintiff\u2019s court. See Perry, at 179\u201380, 272\u201373. The \nplaintiff could respond with his own demurrer, \naccepting the new facts alleged in avoidance but \ndenying their legal effect, which would frame up an \nissue of law for the judge. Id. Or the plaintiff could \nrespond with a traverse to the plea, joining issue on \nthe merits and triggering a trial. See id. There were \nsome other ways to procure judicial decision of a true \nquestion of law, such as the arcane concept of \u201cexpress \ncolor\u201d in trespass actions.5 As far as counsel can \ndetermine, however, a defendant could never procure \njudicial resolution of disputed facts relevant to a \ndispositive affirmative defense like exhaustion. \n \nII.  \nTHE \nPETITION \nOVERSTATES \nTHE \nSUPPOSED \nCONFLICT \nWITH \nTHE \nPLRA\u2019S PURPOSES, WHICH DO NOT \nTRUMP THE SEVENTH AMENDMENT \nIN ANY EVENT \n \nThe Seventh Circuit justified its distortion of \ntraditional jury trial principles because it thought \n\u201c[t]he alternative . . . is unsatisfactory\u201d and \u201cwould \nthwart Congress\u2019s effort to bar trials of prisoner \n                                                 \n5 See Shipman \u00a7\u00a7 200\u2013202, at 350\u201355; Perry, at 274\u201376. Even \nthen, if the issue of law was not \u201cwholly foreign to the merits of \nthe cause,\u201d Shipman \u00a7 202, at 354\u201355, and could not be \n\u201csegregate[d] . . . from the remaining matters of fact,\u201d Perry, at \n275, then the defendant could not withdraw the matter from the \njury.  \n\n18 \n \n \ncases in which the prisoner has failed to exhaust his \nadministrative remedies.\u201d Pavey, 544 F.3d at 742. \nThe petition doubles down on that position, devoting \nbarrels of ink to arguing that Congress intended to \nmake exhaustion a \u201cthreshold issue[] of judicial \nadministration,\u201d Pet. 17 (quoting Lee v. Willey, 789 \nF.3d 673, 678 (6th Cir. 2015)), to weed out frivolous \nclaims. The petition notably ignores the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s conclusion that Richards\u2019s allegations were \n\u201cserious and detailed\u201d and could not \u201creasonably be \nconsidered frivolous.\u201d Pet. App. 8a. Instead, the \npetition elects to criticizes the Sixth Circuit for \n\u201cfail[ing] \nto \ngive \ndeference\u201d \nin \nits \nSeventh \nAmendment \nanalysis \nto \nCongress\u2019s \nsupposed \nobjectives, Pet. 20. \nAll of this is both irrelevant and overstated. It is \nirrelevant because Congress\u2019s desire to reduce the \nworkload of the federal courts does not give it a free \npass to violate the Bill of Rights. If the Seventh \nAmendment protects a right to jury resolution of all \nfacts intertwined with the merits of a legal claim \n(and it does) then the Seventh Amendment controls. \nCongress has ample tools to address this perceived \nproblem without violating the jury trial right, and it \nhas used them\u2014aggressively.  \nThese concerns are overstated for a couple of \nreasons. First, in Woodford and Jones this Court has \nalready rejected the once-pervasive arguments and \nholdings that PLRA exhaustion is a jurisdictional or \nquasi-jurisdictional right not to face litigation at all, \nwhich necessarily must be resolved before anything \nelse happens in a case. Prior to Woodford and Jones, \nthe lower courts invented procedural vehicles found \nnowhere \nin \nthe \nFederal \nRules, \nsuch \nas \nthe \n\u201cunenumerated 12(b) motion,\u201d Wyatt v. Terhune, 315 \n\n19 \n \n \nF.3d 1108 (9th Cir. 2003); requiring prisoner plaintiffs \nto plead exhaustion with specificity up front; or \ndismissing entire complaints if any claim was not \nexhausted. See Jones, 549 U.S. at 203 (holding that \nthese innovations \u201cexceed[ed] the proper limits on the \njudicial role\u201d). But this Court held that exhaustion is \nan ordinary affirmative defense. See id. at 212-214. \nAffirmative defenses (all of them) must be raised by \nanswer under Rule 8(c), which places the burden of \nproof on the defendant and leaves the question to be \nresolved in the ordinary course through summary \njudgment or trial. No doubt the lower courts find those \nholdings inconvenient (or \u201cunsatisfactory,\u201d Pavey, 544 \nF.3d at 742), but they represent this Court\u2019s \nconclusion that in fact Congress did not intend to \nmake exhaustion of administrative remedies some \nkind of threshold super-requirement. When it wants \nto, Congress knows how to write jurisdictional \nstatutes, or immunity statutes like the Foreign \nSovereign Immunities Act, which create a vehicle for \nthreshold resolution of some important issue before \nanything else happens. It did not take that course in \nthe PLRA, and this Court has already said so. See id. \nat 216 (noting the conspicuous \u201cfailure of Congress to \ninclude exhaustion in terms among the enumerated \ngrounds justifying dismissal upon early screening\u201d). \nSecond, the Sixth Circuit\u2019s holding is narrow and \nthere is no reason to think it will have a dramatic \nimpact on prisoner litigation. The Sixth Circuit \n\u201cemphasize[d] that a jury trial is appropriate in \nthese circumstances only if the district court finds \nthat genuine disputes of material fact concerning \nPLRA exhaustion are decisive of the merits of the \nplaintiff\u2019s claim.\u201d Pet. App. 19a. (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). The petition argues that every \n\n20 \n \n \nprisoner suit will somehow allege exhaustion facts \nintertwined with the merits, but the ordinary rules \nof civil procedure are up to that challenge\u2014and if \nnot this Court has, \u201c[i]n a series of recent cases, . . . \nexplained that courts should generally not depart \nfrom the usual practice under the Federal Rules on \nthe basis of perceived policy concerns.\u201d See id. at \n212. The Sixth Circuit\u2019s rule has already been \napplied in district courts throughout the Second \nCircuit for more than a decade without issue. See \nPet. App. 15a-16a.  \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nThe petition should be denied.  \n \n \n \n \n \nJ.

The \nopinion of the United States District Court for the \nWestern District of Michigan (Pet. App. 22a\u201328a) is \nnot reported but is available at 2022 WL 842654. \nJURISDICTION \nThe district court had jurisdiction over claims \nbrought by Respondent Kyle Brandon Richards under \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. The district \ncourt entered judgment for Petitioner Thomas Perttu \non March 22, 2022. Richards filed a timely notice of \nappeal by right on April 11, 2022. The court of appeals \nhad jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s final \njudgment under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. This Court has ju-\nrisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \n \n \n\n2 \n \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe Seventh Amendment to the United States \nConstitution, U.S. Const. amend. VII, provides: \nIn suits at common law, where the value in \ncontroversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the \nright of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no \nfact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-ex-\namined in any Court of the United States, \nthan according to the rules of the common law. \nThe Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a), states in applicable part: \n(a) No action shall be brought with respect to \nprison conditions under section 1983 of this ti-\ntle, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner \nconfined in any jail, prison, or other correc-\ntional facility until such administrative reme-\ndies as are available are exhausted. \nINTRODUCTION \nThe importance of the Seventh Amendment right \nto a trial by jury is well recognized. Less clear, but \nequally important, is the central principle that under-\ngirds the right: preservation of the right to a jury\u2019s ul-\ntimate determination of issues of fact where a case \nproceeds to trial. Embedded in that principle is a tacit \nlimitation\u2014the Seventh Amendment does not guar-\nantee the right to a jury trial on every fact question \nwithin a jury-triable case. Rather, the right is impli-\ncated only when a particular issue or trial decision \nmust fall to the jury to maintain the substance of the \n\n3 \n \ncommon-law right as it existed in 1791. This limita-\ntion is consistent with this Court\u2019s jurisprudence\u2014\nboth its historical view of the Seventh Amendment \nand its treatment of cases involving an overlap of legal \nand equitable issues that implicate collateral estoppel \nconcerns as opposed to cases where those concerns are \nnot present.  \nThe issue of exhaustion under the PLRA is not one \nfor a jury. Exhaustion has no precise historical analog, \nand the closest analogs are forum-based equitable de-\nfenses, which were historically decided by judges, not \nby juries.  \nThis understanding endures even where the facts \nunderlying the question of exhaustion are intertwined \nwith the merits of a prisoner\u2019s claim. In this circum-\nstance, a judge\u2019s determination as to exhaustion does \nnot impinge on the \u201csubstance\u201d of the jury trial right\u2014\nthat right remains preserved. Where the prisoner has \nproperly exhausted administrative remedies, a jury \nmay then be impaneled to find the facts concerning \nthe underlying claims and will not be bound by the \njudge\u2019s earlier factual determinations. This division of \nduties is consistent with a judge\u2019s gatekeeping role, \ncomports with the goals of the PLRA, and protects the \nright to trial by jury. \n \n \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. The PLRA Framework \nIn 1970, just over 2,000 prisoner civil rights suits \nwere filed in federal courts. Margo Schlanger, Trends \nin Prisoner Litigation, as the PLRA Approaches 20, 28 \nCorr. L. Reporter, 69, 71 (2017). Shortly after that, fil-\nings exploded. Id.  \nIn 1980, Congress took a first stab at an exhaus-\ntion provision for prisoner suits filed under \u00a7 1983. \nUnder the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons \nAct, 94 Stat. 352, as amended, district courts could \nstay a prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 1983 suit for up to 180 days while \nthe prisoner pursued \u201cplain, speedy, and effective ad-\nministrative remedies.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a)(1) (for-\nmer). The exhaustion requirement was discretionary \nthough\u2014exhaustion could be required only if the \nstate\u2019s prison grievance system met federal standards \nand if exhaustion was \u201cappropriate and in the inter-\nests of justice.\u201d \u00a7 1997e(a)(1), (2). \nBut that exhaustion provision did not stem the \ntide of prisoner litigation. By the mid-1990s, correc-\ntional systems and federal courts were overburdened \nby a mammoth caseload of prisoner litigation. In 1995 \nalone, 39,053 prisoner lawsuits were filed in federal \ncourt, a rate of 24.6 per 1,000 prisoners. Schlanger, \nTrends in Prisoner Litigation, supra, at 71. Not sur-\nprisingly, this strained the resources of the federal \ncourt system, not to mention correctional systems.  \nIn 1996, Congress enacted the PLRA \u201cin the wake \nof a sharp rise in prisoner litigation in the federal \ncourts.\u201d Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 84 (2006) \n\n5 \n \n(citing Alexander v. Hawk, 159 F.3d 1321, 1324\u201325 \n(11th Cir. 1998) (citing statistics)). A significant com-\nponent of the PLRA was a robust, mandatory exhaus-\ntion requirement. Congress \u201cinvigorated the exhaus-\ntion prescription\u201d that had existed under the prior re-\ngime, now requiring prisoners to fully exhaust all of \ntheir available administrative remedies through the \ngrievance process as a prerequisite to filing suit in fed-\neral court. Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 524 (2002).  \nAs stated by this Court, \u201cBeyond doubt, Congress \nenacted \u00a7 1997e(a) to reduce the quantity and improve \nthe quality of prisoner suits.\u201d Id. at 524. To further \nthis end, \u201cCongress afforded corrections officials time \nand opportunity to address complaints internally\u201d \nprior to prisoners seeking relief in federal court. Id. at \n525. By giving correctional officials the opportunity to \naddress grievances, \u201ccorrective action taken in re-\nsponse to an inmate\u2019s grievance might improve prison \nadministration and satisfy the inmate, thereby obvi-\nating the need for litigation.\u201d Id. (citing Booth v. \nChurner, 532 U.S. 731, 737 (2001)). In addition, a \nprison\u2019s \u201cinternal review might \u2018filter out some frivo-\nlous claims.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting Booth, 532 U.S. at 737). \nAnd the administrative record created by the prisons\u2019 \ninternal grievance processes would facilitate consider-\nation of those \u201ccases ultimately brought to court.\u201d Id. \n(citations omitted).  \nThe PLRA has been tremendously successful in \nreducing the burden on both prison officials and fed-\neral courts. From the peak of filings in 1995, within \nfive years of the passage of the PLRA prisoner law-\nsuits had fallen by 43%, even though the total prisoner \npopulation grew by 23%. Margo Schlanger, Inmate \n\n6 \n \nLitigation, 116 Harv. L. Rev. 1555, 1694 (2003). This \ndecline continued for several more years. By 2006, the \ndecline reached 60%. Margo Schlanger & Giovanna \nShay, Preserving the Rule of Law in America\u2019s Jails \nand Prisons: The Case for Amending the Prison Liti-\ngation Reform Act, 11 U. Pa. J. Const. L. 139, 141\u201342 \n(2008). Although the decline gradually plateaued, by \n2014, prisoners filed 25,324 lawsuits, a rate of 11.6 per \n1,000 prisoners. Schlanger, Trends in Prisoner Litiga-\ntion, supra, at 71. Compared to 1995, this represents \na 34% decrease in the number of prisoner lawsuits and \na 53% decline in the rate of lawsuits filed per 1,000 \nprisoners. See id. The exhaustion requirement has \nbeen a critical component of the PLRA\u2019s success.  \nB. MDOC\u2019s grievance process \nThe Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC) \nhas two separate processes for grievances. One is the \nstandard grievance procedure, governed by MDOC \nPolicy Directive 03.02.130, which is not applicable \nhere. J.A. 41\u201361. The other is the administrative pro-\ncess under the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA), \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 15601, et seq., and the Prohibited Sexual \nConduct Involving Prisoners policy (effective date \n04/24/2017), governed by MDOC Policy Directive \n03.03.140. J.A. 62\u201387.  \nThe PREA grievance procedure applies to Rich-\nards\u2019 claims of sexual abuse, harassment, and miscon-\nduct. MDOC uses a two-step process for PREA griev-\nances, both of which must be exhausted. J.A. 74\u201375. \nMDOC will not facially reject or deny grievances al-\nleging sexual abuse. J.A. 74\u201375. Instead, such \n\n7 \n \ngrievances must be investigated. J.A. 76. \u201cA prisoner \nmay file a PREA grievance at any time.\u201d J.A. 75.  \nA prisoner initiates the first step of the process by \nfiling a PREA Prisoner Grievance Form (Step I). \nJ.A. 75. Prisoners may grieve retaliation for reporting \nsexual abuse, harassment, or misconduct through the \nPREA grievance process. J.A. 72\u201373. PREA griev-\nances may not be referred to MDOC staff who are the \nsubject of the grievance. J.A. 76.  \nAt Step I, the PREA Coordinator1 must ensure \nthat \u201ca written response is provided to the prisoner \nwithin 60 calendar days of receipt of the Step I PREA \nGrievance,\u201d although an extension of up to 70 calen-\ndar days may be requested. J.A. 76\u201377. Prisoners \nmust be notified in writing of any extensions and the \ndue date for a response. J.A. 76\u201377.  \nPrisoners may appeal a Step I decision to Step II \nif they are unsatisfied with the response or the re-\nsponse was not timely. J.A. 77. MDOC\u2019s response to a \nStep II appeal is due within 90 calendar days of re-\nceipt, absent an extension, and it constitutes the final \ndecision in the matter. J.A. 77.  \nC. District Court Proceedings and Eviden-\ntiary Hearing \nRichards and co-Plaintiffs Kenneth Damon Pruitt \nand Robert Kissee filed suit under \u00a7 1983, alleging \nthat Perttu, a Resident Unit Manager (RUM) for the \nMDOC, sexually harassed them and other prisoners, \n \n1 Every prison has a PREA Coordinator designated by the war-\nden. J.A. 67.  \n\n8 \n \nretaliated against them, and destroyed their property, \nin violation of the First, Fifth, and Eighth Amend-\nments. J.A. 1\u201338. Perttu moved for summary judg-\nment, asserting that Richards and his co-Plaintiffs \nfailed to exhaust administrative remedies before filing \ntheir complaint. Pet. App. 3a. Richards and his co-\nPlaintiffs alleged that Perttu had destroyed their \ngrievances or otherwise prevented them from being \nprocessed, making the grievance process unavailable. \nPet. App. 30a, 37a, 59a\u201360a. \nThe district court denied Perttu\u2019s motion, finding \nthat there was a question of fact as to whether the \ngrievance process was available to Richards due to his \nallegation that Perttu interfered with his grievance \nfilings. Pet. App. 79a\u201381a, 83a.  \nFollowing this ruling, the magistrate judge con-\nducted an evidentiary hearing on the issue of exhaus-\ntion. J.A. 88\u2013368. Evaluating the testimony, evidence, \nand arguments presented, the magistrate judge rec-\nommended that the district court conclude that Perttu \ncarried his burden of establishing \u201cthat Plaintiffs \nfailed to exhaust any of their claims before filing suit,\u201d \nPet. App. 64a, 76a, and that the \u201cadministrative rem-\nedies were generally available\u201d to Richards and his co-\nPlaintiffs. Pet. App. 68a.  \nIn reaching that conclusion, the magistrate judge \nfound that Richards\u2019 direct examinations, which re-\nlied on leading questions, undermined the credibility \nof his witnesses. Pet. App. 69a. The magistrate judge \nthen discussed how the circumstances surrounding \nthe alleged observations of Perttu destroying griev-\nances similarly undermined Plaintiffs\u2019 credibility. Pet. \nApp. 71a\u201373a. Notably, the evidence \u201cdemonstrate[d] \n\n9 \n \nthat RUM Perttu could not, and in fact did not, inter-\ncept and destroy all grievances filed by Plaintiffs in \nthe relevant time\u201d: \n[E]ven on the dates that RUM Perttu worked, \nhe testified that he only works from 7:00am to \n3:30pm. Moreover, RUM Perttu did not work \nseven days a week every week from June 2019 \nto March 2020. Indeed, on at least one of the \ndates on which Richards alleges Perttu de-\nstroyed his grievances, January 1, 2020, \nPerttu testified that he was not working due \nto the New Years holiday. \nPet. App. 73a\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

This Court has held that judges can \ndecide facts related to threshold issues\u2014\nlike exhaustion\u2014without violating the \nSeventh Amendment. .................................. 16 \nB. The Seventh Amendment does not \npreserve the right to a jury trial on any \nfactual questions concerning exhaustion \nbecause exhaustion derives from equity. .... 19 \n\niii \n \n1. The Seventh Amendment guarantees \na jury trial right only as to issues \ntried by a jury in suits at common \nlaw at the time the Seventh \nAmendment was adopted. ..................... 20 \n2. Exhaustion did not exist at the \ncommon law, but closely analogous \nequitable issues were not decided by \njuries in 1791. ........................................ 22 \na. No historical antecedent to \nexhaustion existed at common \nlaw, but its origins are equitable \nin nature. ......................................... 23 \nb. Traditional equitable defenses \nsuch as adequate remedy at law, \nforum non conveniens, \nabstention, and habeas corpus \nbars are an appropriate common-\nlaw analog for exhaustion. .............. 27 \n3. Juries did not historically determine \nquestions of fact related to equitable \ndefenses analogous to exhaustion. ........ 33 \n4. Functional considerations \ndemonstrate that judges, not juries, \nshould determine exhaustion \nquestions. ............................................... 35 \nII. The Seventh Amendment does not preserve \nthe right to a jury trial on factual questions \nconcerning exhaustion even when those \nfactual questions are intertwined with the \nunderlying merits. .............................................. 37 \n\niv \n \nA. Beacon Theatres created a presumption \nthat juries should decide intertwined \nlegal and equitable issues, but that \npresumption does not apply here. ............... 38 \n1. The presumption does not apply \nbecause exhaustion is a threshold \nissue that is logically precedent to the \nmerits. .................................................... 41 \n2. The presumption does not apply \nbecause a judge\u2019s factual findings \nregarding exhaustion would not \npreclude a jury\u2019s consideration of the \nsame facts when determining the \nmerits of the legal claim. ....................... 43 \nB.

The \nopinion of the United States District Court for the \nWestern District of Michigan (Pet. App. 22a\u201328a) is \nnot reported but is available at 2022 WL 842654. \nJURISDICTION \nThe district court had jurisdiction over claims \nbrought by Respondent Kyle Brandon Richards under \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. The district \ncourt entered judgment for Petitioner Thomas Perttu \non March 22, 2022. Richards filed a timely notice of \nappeal by right on April 11, 2022. The court of appeals \nhad jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s final \njudgment under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. This Court has ju-\nrisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \n \n \n\n2 \n \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe Seventh Amendment to the United States \nConstitution, U.S. Const. amend. VII, provides: \nIn suits at common law, where the value in \ncontroversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the \nright of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no \nfact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-ex-\namined in any Court of the United States, \nthan according to the rules of the common law. \nThe Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a), states in applicable part: \n(a) No action shall be brought with respect to \nprison conditions under section 1983 of this ti-\ntle, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner \nconfined in any jail, prison, or other correc-\ntional facility until such administrative reme-\ndies as are available are exhausted. \nINTRODUCTION \nThe importance of the Seventh Amendment right \nto a trial by jury is well recognized. Less clear, but \nequally important, is the central principle that under-\ngirds the right: preservation of the right to a jury\u2019s ul-\ntimate determination of issues of fact where a case \nproceeds to trial. Embedded in that principle is a tacit \nlimitation\u2014the Seventh Amendment does not guar-\nantee the right to a jury trial on every fact question \nwithin a jury-triable case. Rather, the right is impli-\ncated only when a particular issue or trial decision \nmust fall to the jury to maintain the substance of the \n\n3 \n \ncommon-law right as it existed in 1791. This limita-\ntion is consistent with this Court\u2019s jurisprudence\u2014\nboth its historical view of the Seventh Amendment \nand its treatment of cases involving an overlap of legal \nand equitable issues that implicate collateral estoppel \nconcerns as opposed to cases where those concerns are \nnot present.  \nThe issue of exhaustion under the PLRA is not one \nfor a jury. Exhaustion has no precise historical analog, \nand the closest analogs are forum-based equitable de-\nfenses, which were historically decided by judges, not \nby juries.  \nThis understanding endures even where the facts \nunderlying the question of exhaustion are intertwined \nwith the merits of a prisoner\u2019s claim. In this circum-\nstance, a judge\u2019s determination as to exhaustion does \nnot impinge on the \u201csubstance\u201d of the jury trial right\u2014\nthat right remains preserved. Where the prisoner has \nproperly exhausted administrative remedies, a jury \nmay then be impaneled to find the facts concerning \nthe underlying claims and will not be bound by the \njudge\u2019s earlier factual determinations. This division of \nduties is consistent with a judge\u2019s gatekeeping role, \ncomports with the goals of the PLRA, and protects the \nright to trial by jury. \n \n \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. The PLRA Framework \nIn 1970, just over 2,000 prisoner civil rights suits \nwere filed in federal courts. Margo Schlanger, Trends \nin Prisoner Litigation, as the PLRA Approaches 20, 28 \nCorr. L. Reporter, 69, 71 (2017). Shortly after that, fil-\nings exploded. Id.  \nIn 1980, Congress took a first stab at an exhaus-\ntion provision for prisoner suits filed under \u00a7 1983. \nUnder the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons \nAct, 94 Stat. 352, as amended, district courts could \nstay a prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 1983 suit for up to 180 days while \nthe prisoner pursued \u201cplain, speedy, and effective ad-\nministrative remedies.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a)(1) (for-\nmer). The exhaustion requirement was discretionary \nthough\u2014exhaustion could be required only if the \nstate\u2019s prison grievance system met federal standards \nand if exhaustion was \u201cappropriate and in the inter-\nests of justice.\u201d \u00a7 1997e(a)(1), (2). \nBut that exhaustion provision did not stem the \ntide of prisoner litigation. By the mid-1990s, correc-\ntional systems and federal courts were overburdened \nby a mammoth caseload of prisoner litigation. In 1995 \nalone, 39,053 prisoner lawsuits were filed in federal \ncourt, a rate of 24.6 per 1,000 prisoners. Schlanger, \nTrends in Prisoner Litigation, supra, at 71. Not sur-\nprisingly, this strained the resources of the federal \ncourt system, not to mention correctional systems.  \nIn 1996, Congress enacted the PLRA \u201cin the wake \nof a sharp rise in prisoner litigation in the federal \ncourts.\u201d Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 84 (2006) \n\n5 \n \n(citing Alexander v. Hawk, 159 F.3d 1321, 1324\u201325 \n(11th Cir. 1998) (citing statistics)). A significant com-\nponent of the PLRA was a robust, mandatory exhaus-\ntion requirement. Congress \u201cinvigorated the exhaus-\ntion prescription\u201d that had existed under the prior re-\ngime, now requiring prisoners to fully exhaust all of \ntheir available administrative remedies through the \ngrievance process as a prerequisite to filing suit in fed-\neral court. Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 524 (2002).  \nAs stated by this Court, \u201cBeyond doubt, Congress \nenacted \u00a7 1997e(a) to reduce the quantity and improve \nthe quality of prisoner suits.\u201d Id. at 524. To further \nthis end, \u201cCongress afforded corrections officials time \nand opportunity to address complaints internally\u201d \nprior to prisoners seeking relief in federal court. Id. at \n525. By giving correctional officials the opportunity to \naddress grievances, \u201ccorrective action taken in re-\nsponse to an inmate\u2019s grievance might improve prison \nadministration and satisfy the inmate, thereby obvi-\nating the need for litigation.\u201d Id. (citing Booth v. \nChurner, 532 U.S. 731, 737 (2001)). In addition, a \nprison\u2019s \u201cinternal review might \u2018filter out some frivo-\nlous claims.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting Booth, 532 U.S. at 737). \nAnd the administrative record created by the prisons\u2019 \ninternal grievance processes would facilitate consider-\nation of those \u201ccases ultimately brought to court.\u201d Id. \n(citations omitted).  \nThe PLRA has been tremendously successful in \nreducing the burden on both prison officials and fed-\neral courts. From the peak of filings in 1995, within \nfive years of the passage of the PLRA prisoner law-\nsuits had fallen by 43%, even though the total prisoner \npopulation grew by 23%. Margo Schlanger, Inmate \n\n6 \n \nLitigation, 116 Harv. L. Rev. 1555, 1694 (2003). This \ndecline continued for several more years. By 2006, the \ndecline reached 60%. Margo Schlanger & Giovanna \nShay, Preserving the Rule of Law in America\u2019s Jails \nand Prisons: The Case for Amending the Prison Liti-\ngation Reform Act, 11 U. Pa. J. Const. L. 139, 141\u201342 \n(2008). Although the decline gradually plateaued, by \n2014, prisoners filed 25,324 lawsuits, a rate of 11.6 per \n1,000 prisoners. Schlanger, Trends in Prisoner Litiga-\ntion, supra, at 71. Compared to 1995, this represents \na 34% decrease in the number of prisoner lawsuits and \na 53% decline in the rate of lawsuits filed per 1,000 \nprisoners. See id. The exhaustion requirement has \nbeen a critical component of the PLRA\u2019s success.  \nB. MDOC\u2019s grievance process \nThe Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC) \nhas two separate processes for grievances. One is the \nstandard grievance procedure, governed by MDOC \nPolicy Directive 03.02.130, which is not applicable \nhere. J.A. 41\u201361. The other is the administrative pro-\ncess under the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA), \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 15601, et seq., and the Prohibited Sexual \nConduct Involving Prisoners policy (effective date \n04/24/2017), governed by MDOC Policy Directive \n03.03.140. J.A. 62\u201387.  \nThe PREA grievance procedure applies to Rich-\nards\u2019 claims of sexual abuse, harassment, and miscon-\nduct. MDOC uses a two-step process for PREA griev-\nances, both of which must be exhausted. J.A. 74\u201375. \nMDOC will not facially reject or deny grievances al-\nleging sexual abuse. J.A. 74\u201375. Instead, such \n\n7 \n \ngrievances must be investigated. J.A. 76. \u201cA prisoner \nmay file a PREA grievance at any time.\u201d J.A. 75.  \nA prisoner initiates the first step of the process by \nfiling a PREA Prisoner Grievance Form (Step I). \nJ.A. 75. Prisoners may grieve retaliation for reporting \nsexual abuse, harassment, or misconduct through the \nPREA grievance process. J.A. 72\u201373. PREA griev-\nances may not be referred to MDOC staff who are the \nsubject of the grievance. J.A. 76.  \nAt Step I, the PREA Coordinator1 must ensure \nthat \u201ca written response is provided to the prisoner \nwithin 60 calendar days of receipt of the Step I PREA \nGrievance,\u201d although an extension of up to 70 calen-\ndar days may be requested. J.A. 76\u201377. Prisoners \nmust be notified in writing of any extensions and the \ndue date for a response. J.A. 76\u201377.  \nPrisoners may appeal a Step I decision to Step II \nif they are unsatisfied with the response or the re-\nsponse was not timely. J.A. 77. MDOC\u2019s response to a \nStep II appeal is due within 90 calendar days of re-\nceipt, absent an extension, and it constitutes the final \ndecision in the matter. J.A. 77.  \nC. District Court Proceedings and Eviden-\ntiary Hearing \nRichards and co-Plaintiffs Kenneth Damon Pruitt \nand Robert Kissee filed suit under \u00a7 1983, alleging \nthat Perttu, a Resident Unit Manager (RUM) for the \nMDOC, sexually harassed them and other prisoners, \n \n1 Every prison has a PREA Coordinator designated by the war-\nden. J.A. 67.  \n\n8 \n \nretaliated against them, and destroyed their property, \nin violation of the First, Fifth, and Eighth Amend-\nments. J.A. 1\u201338. Perttu moved for summary judg-\nment, asserting that Richards and his co-Plaintiffs \nfailed to exhaust administrative remedies before filing \ntheir complaint. Pet. App. 3a. Richards and his co-\nPlaintiffs alleged that Perttu had destroyed their \ngrievances or otherwise prevented them from being \nprocessed, making the grievance process unavailable. \nPet. App. 30a, 37a, 59a\u201360a. \nThe district court denied Perttu\u2019s motion, finding \nthat there was a question of fact as to whether the \ngrievance process was available to Richards due to his \nallegation that Perttu interfered with his grievance \nfilings. Pet. App. 79a\u201381a, 83a.  \nFollowing this ruling, the magistrate judge con-\nducted an evidentiary hearing on the issue of exhaus-\ntion. J.A. 88\u2013368. Evaluating the testimony, evidence, \nand arguments presented, the magistrate judge rec-\nommended that the district court conclude that Perttu \ncarried his burden of establishing \u201cthat Plaintiffs \nfailed to exhaust any of their claims before filing suit,\u201d \nPet. App. 64a, 76a, and that the \u201cadministrative rem-\nedies were generally available\u201d to Richards and his co-\nPlaintiffs. Pet. App. 68a.  \nIn reaching that conclusion, the magistrate judge \nfound that Richards\u2019 direct examinations, which re-\nlied on leading questions, undermined the credibility \nof his witnesses. Pet. App. 69a. The magistrate judge \nthen discussed how the circumstances surrounding \nthe alleged observations of Perttu destroying griev-\nances similarly undermined Plaintiffs\u2019 credibility. Pet. \nApp. 71a\u201373a. Notably, the evidence \u201cdemonstrate[d] \n\n9 \n \nthat RUM Perttu could not, and in fact did not, inter-\ncept and destroy all grievances filed by Plaintiffs in \nthe relevant time\u201d: \n[E]ven on the dates that RUM Perttu worked, \nhe testified that he only works from 7:00am to \n3:30pm. Moreover, RUM Perttu did not work \nseven days a week every week from June 2019 \nto March 2020. Indeed, on at least one of the \ndates on which Richards alleges Perttu de-\nstroyed his grievances, January 1, 2020, \nPerttu testified that he was not working due \nto the New Years holiday. \nPet. App. 73a. \nMoreover, the evidence showed that Richards had \naccess to the grievance process: \nBut even had Perttu been working every hour \nof every day . . . Richards actually took ad-\nvantage of the grievance procedure by filing \nStep I grievance forms twenty-six times be-\ntween June 6, 2019, and April 23, 2020.  \n* * * \nMoreover, of Richards\u2019s six Step I grievance \nforms entered into evidence, three specifically \ngrieved RUM Perttu, undermining any allega-\ntion that Perttu sorted through the grievances \nand discarded those directed towards him.  \nPet. App. 73a\u201374a.  \n\n10 \n \nThe magistrate judge noted that \u201cRichards\u2019s suc-\ncessful use of the grievance procedure . . . directly con-\ntradicts Plaintiffs\u2019 claim that administrative remedies \nwere effectively unavailable, and Plaintiffs\u2019 failure \n[to] use any of the alternative reporting methods . . . \ncasts doubt on their alleged attempts to file PREA \ngrievances.\u201d Pet. App. 75a.  \nThe magistrate judge found that \u201cPlaintiffs pro-\nvided no evidence that RUM Perttu\u201d influenced the \ncorrections officers he supervised to destroy or not \nprocess their grievances. Pet. App. 75a. Indeed, \u201cthe \ncredibility of Plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses was undermined by \ntheir inability to independently recollect the time or \nlocation of RUM Perttu\u2019s alleged destruction of Plain-\ntiff\u2019s grievances, as well as the unlikely circumstances \nunder which they claimed they observed such destruc-\ntion.\u201d Pet. App. 75a\u201376a. For instance, as a matter of \n\u201ccommon sense,\u201d Perttu could not have been \u201cpresent \nto intercept every grievance\u201d filed by Plaintiffs. Pet. \nApp. 76a. Based on these findings, the magistrate \njudge recommended that the district court conclude \nthat Richards and his co-Plaintiffs failed to exhaust \ntheir claims against Perttu and dismiss their claims \nwithout prejudice. Pet. App. 76a.  \nRichards and his co-Plaintiffs filed nine objec-\ntions, which the district court overruled. Pet. App. \n22a\u201328a. The district court adopted the report and \nrecommendation and entered judgment for Perttu. \nPet. App. 29a. Richards alone appealed the district \ncourt\u2019s ruling.  \n\n11 \n \nD. Sixth Circuit Proceedings \nOn appeal, Richards argued that the district court \nerred by not granting him a jury trial to resolve the \nexhaustion issue, which he claimed was intertwined \nwith the merits of his case.  \nThe Sixth Circuit began its analysis by discussing \nwhether the exhaustion issue was intertwined with \nRichards\u2019 underlying retaliation claim, noting that \nRichards alleged that Perttu destroyed his grievances, \npreventing him from exhausting the grievance re-\nquirements. Richards\u2019 complaint, the Sixth Circuit \nsaid, \u201clays out several specific instances when Perttu \nallegedly destroyed grievances that Richards had in-\ntended to file.\u201d Pet. App. 2a\u20133a. This allegedly \u201cinter-\nfered with Richards\u2019s speech.\u201d Pet. App. 10a. Under \nthese circumstances, the court concluded that \u201cthe \nfactual disputes regarding exhaustion . . . are inter-\ntwined with the merits of Richards\u2019s retaliation \nclaim.\u201d Pet. App. 12a. \nThe Sixth Circuit turned its attention to whether \nthis intertwining implicated the Seventh Amendment \nright to a jury trial. The court recognized that, in Lee \nv. Willey, 789 F.3d 673 (6th Cir. 2015), it held that the \nprisoner had no right to a jury trial for an exhaustion \ndefense under the PLRA. Pet. App. 13a. But the court \nnoted that Lee did not govern the present case because \nthe disputed facts of the exhaustion issue were not \n\u201c \u2018bound up with the merits of the underlying dis-\npute.\u2019 \u201d Pet. App. 13a (quoting Lee, 789 F.3d at 678).  \nThe Sixth Circuit then looked to the other circuits, \nnoting that only the Seventh Circuit had squarely ad-\ndressed the issue, in Pavey v. Conley, 544 F.3d 739 \n\n12 \n \n(7th Cir. 2008). There, the Seventh Circuit held that \nprisoners had no right to a jury trial to determine \nwhether they had exhausted their administrative \nremedies under the PLRA, regardless of whether the \nexhaustion issue is intertwined with the merits of the \ncase. Pet. App. 14a (citing Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741\u201342). \nAccording to the Seventh Circuit, \u201c[j]uries decide \ncases, not issues of judicial traffic control.\u201d Pavey, 544 \nF.3d at 741. The Ninth Circuit agreed with the rea-\nsoning of Pavey in Albino v. Baca, 747 F.3d 1162, 1171 \n(9th Cir. 2014) (en banc) (citations omitted). Pet. App. \n14a. \nInstead of following the reasoning of the Seventh \nand Ninth Circuits, the Sixth Circuit found \u201cseveral \ndistrict-court decisions in the Second Circuit\u201d more \nconvincing. Pet. App. 15a\u201317a. It ultimately con-\ncluded that \u201cRichards was stripped of his right to a \njury\u2019s resolution of the ultimate dispute\u201d because he \nwas denied a jury trial on the exhaustion issue. Pet. \nApp. 17a (internal citation omitted). The Sixth Circuit \nalso relied on Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Co. v. Rail-\nway Express Agency, Inc., 253 F.2d 780, 784 (6th Cir. \n1958). Pet. App. 17a\u201319a. In Fireman\u2019s Fund, the \nSixth Circuit had held that when jurisdiction is inter-\ntwined with the merits of the case, the issue cannot be \nsummarily decided where factual claims would not be \nsubject to cross-examination. 253 F.2d at 784 (\u201cthe \nmerits of a controversy could be summarily decided, \npartly on affidavits without the right of cross-exami-\nnation\u201d) (citation omitted). \nThe Sixth Circuit held that the district court erred \nby ordering an evidentiary hearing rather than a jury \ntrial on the issue of exhaustion, \u201cemphasiz[ing] that a \n\n13 \n \njury trial is appropriate in these circumstances only if \nthe district court finds that genuine disputes of mate-\nrial fact concerning PLRA exhaustion are \u2018decisive of \nthe merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claim.\u2019 \u201d Pet. App. 19a \n(quoting Fireman\u2019s Fund, 253 F.2d at 784). \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe PLRA mandates that prisoners exhaust ad-\nministrative remedies before filing a lawsuit in fed-\neral court. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). Despite this precon-\ndition to suit, the Sixth Circuit held that prisoners are \nentitled to a jury trial when exhaustion disputes are \nintertwined with the merits of their claims. This con-\nclusion is not grounded in the Seventh Amendment. \n1. The Seventh Amendment permits courts to re-\nsolve disputed facts bearing on whether prisoners \nhave exhausted their claims. The Amendment pre-\nserves the right to a jury trial as it existed under the \nEnglish common law in 1791. Consistent with the \nAmendment\u2019s language, this Court has adhered to a \n\u201chistorical test,\u201d which asks two questions: (1) \nwhether the cause of action at issue \u201ceither was tried \nat law at the time of the founding or is at least analo-\ngous to one that was,\u201d Markman v. Westview Instru-\nments, Inc., 517 U.S. 370, 376 (1996) (citation omit-\nted), and (2) \u201c[i]f the action in question belongs in the \nlaw category, . . . whether the particular [issue] . . . \nmust fall to the jury in order to preserve the substance \nof the common-law right as it existed in 1791,\u201d id.  \nThis case turns on the second question, which, as \nthis Court has emphasized, \u201cmust depend on whether \nthe jury must shoulder this responsibility as neces-\nsary to preserve the \u2018substance of the common-law \n\n14 \n \nright of trial by jury.\u2019 \u201d Tull v. United States, 481 U.S. \n412, 426 (1987) (quoting Colgrove v. Battin, 413 U.S. \n149, 157 (1973)). The Court answers this question \nmuch like its first\u2014by using a historical method, and \n\u201c[w]here there is no exact antecedent,\u201d by \u201ccomparing \nthe modern practice to earlier ones whose allocation \nto court or jury we do know.\u201d Markman, 517 U.S. at \n378 (citations omitted).  \nExhaustion did not exist in 1791, and it was not \nuntil the twentieth century that courts fully articu-\nlated the doctrine. Thus, there is no exact antecedent \nto look to for answers. But exhaustion\u2019s roots in courts \nof equity provide helpful guidance. Exhaustion was \napplied by those courts to promote an orderly proce-\ndure whereby an administrative forum was the appro-\npriate starting point for a dispute. Other forum-based \nequitable defenses\u2014such as the adequate remedy at \nlaw doctrine, forum non conveniens, abstention, and \nhabeas corpus bars\u2014therefore provide a suitable his-\ntorical analog.  \nAt common law, these defenses were not afforded \na jury trial right. This was true regardless of whether \nthose defenses were interposed in courts of law, in \nwhich case a court of equity would first dispose of the \nissue. Only where an issue at law remained would \nthat issue be jury-triable. Because these equitable de-\nfenses were not subject to a jury determination at \ncommon law, neither should exhaustion.  \nEven if these historical analogs are insufficient, \nfunctional considerations should guide this Court\u2019s \ndecision. In this regard, the PLRA\u2019s goals\u2014\u201cto reduce \nthe quantity and improve the quality of prisoner \nsuits,\u201d \nPorter, \n534 \nU.S. \nat \n524\u2014would \nbe \n\n15 \n \ncompromised, if not outright defeated, by a jury trial \non exhaustion. The PLRA allows prison officials the \nopportunity to address prisoner complaints prior to \nfederal-court interference. This, in turn, obviates the \nneed for some prisoner lawsuits and creates an admin-\nistrative record for those that are filed.  \nJudges also frequently decide threshold issues \nand are thus better positioned than juries to decide \nexhaustion questions. And due to the significant num-\nber of prisoner cases judges see, they are particularly \nwell-equipped to deal with questions about a prison\u2019s \ninternal operations. Consequently, an exhaustion \nquestion should be allocated to the judge, not a jury.  \n2. That a question of exhaustion is intertwined \nwith the merits of a prisoner\u2019s claim does not change \nthis outcome. While Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, \n359 U.S. 500 (1959), establishes a general rule priori-\ntizing legal issues over equitable ones, it is a pruden-\ntial rule that is premised on the recognition that an \nequitable determination could have a collateral-estop-\npel effect on the merits of a legal claim. These con-\ncerns are not present for an exhaustion determina-\ntion, which is a threshold, pre-merits ruling that the \njury may revisit if an exhausted claim goes to trial. \nFurther, this Court has previously considered \nwhether application of the Beacon Theatres rule would \nundermine a federal statute. Here, the PLRA\u2019s pur-\nposes would be severely undercut by a jury trial on ex-\nhaustion.  \nFor these reasons, the Seventh Amendment does \nnot preserve the right to a jury trial on exhaustion of \nadministrative remedies where disputed facts regard-\ning exhaustion are intertwined with merits of a claim. \n\n16 \n \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe Seventh Amendment does not preserve \nthe right to a jury trial on factual questions \nconcerning exhaustion. \nJudges frequently decide disputed questions of \nfact without violating the Seventh Amendment, par-\nticularly with respect to threshold issues. It is thus no \nsurprise that all courts of appeal to have considered \nthe issue have held that \u201cjudges may resolve factual \ndisputes relevant to the exhaustion issue without the \nparticipation of a jury.\u201d Small v. Camden Cnty., 728 \nF.3d 265, 269\u201371 (3d Cir. 2013); see also Lee, 789 F.3d \nat 677\u201378; Albino, 747 F.3d at 1170\u201371; Messa v. \nGoord, 652 F.3d 305, 308\u201310 (2d Cir. 2011) (per cu-\nriam); Dillon v. Rogers, 596 F.3d 260, 270\u201372 (5th Cir. \n2010); Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741\u201342; Bryant v. Rich, 530 \nF.3d 1368, 1373\u201377 (11th Cir. 2008). These holdings \nare consistent with the Seventh Amendment, which \napplies only to issues tried by a jury in suits at com-\nmon law in 1791. Exhaustion, although unknown at \ncommon law, is rooted in equity and closely analogous \nto traditional equitable defenses, which were not his-\ntorically determined by juries.  \nA. This Court has held that judges can de-\ncide facts related to threshold issues\u2014\nlike exhaustion\u2014without violating the \nSeventh Amendment.  \nAs a general matter, \u201cissues of law are to be re-\nsolved by the court and issues of fact are to be deter-\nmined by the jury.\u201d Baltimore & Carolina Line, Inc. v. \nRedman, 295 U.S. 654, 657 (1935). But this broad \nproposition overstates the Amendment\u2019s sweep, for \n\n17 \n \n\u201cthe Seventh Amendment was never intended to es-\ntablish the jury as the exclusive mechanism for fact-\nfinding in civil cases.\u201d Atlas Roofing Co. v. Occupa-\ntional Safety & Health Review Comm\u2019n, 430 U.S. 442, \n460 (1977); see also Galloway v. United States, 319 \nU.S. 372, 390 (1943) (\u201cThe jury was not absolute mas-\nter of fact in 1791.\u201d). In this vein, this Court has held \nthat the Seventh Amendment \u201cwas designed to pre-\nserve the basic institution of jury trial in only its most \nfundamental elements, not the great mass of proce-\ndural forms and details, varying even then [in 1791] \nso widely among common-law jurisdictions.\u201d Gallo-\nway, 319 U.S. at 392; see also Walker v. N. M. & S. P. \nR. Co., 165 U.S. 593, 596 (1897) (\u201cThe seventh amend-\nment . . . does not attempt to regulate matters of \npleading or practice[.]\u201d).  \nJudges thus frequently decide disputed questions \nof fact without violating the Seventh Amendment. For \nexample, this Court has held that judges may decide \nquestions of fact related to subject-matter jurisdiction, \nWetmore v. Rymer, 169 U.S. 115, 120\u201322 (1898); dis-\ncovery disputes, Herbert v. Lando, 441 U.S. 153, 177 \n(1979); class certifications, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. \nDukes, 564 U.S. 338, 351\u201352 (2011); evidentiary objec-\ntions, Galloway, 319 U.S. at 390; motions for sum-\nmary judgment, Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 \nU.S. 322, 336 (1979); motions for directed verdict, Gal-\nloway, 283 U.S. at 391\u201395; and motions to set aside \nthe verdict, Gasoline Products Co. v. Champlin Refin-\ning Co., 283 U.S. 494, 497\u201398 (1943).  \n \n \n\n18 \n \nThis makes sense for at least two reasons. First, a \njudge\u2019s ability to determine fact disputes related to \nthreshold questions is consistent with the under-\nstanding that \u201c \u2018[t]he Seventh Amendment does not \nconfer the right to a trial, but only the right to have a \njury hear the case once it is determined that the litiga-\ntion should proceed before a court.\u2019 \u201d Caley v. Gulf-\nstream Aerospace Corp., 428 F.3d 1359, 1371 (11th \nCir. 2005) (quoting Am. Heritage Life Ins. Co. v. Orr, \n294 F.3d 702, 711 (5th Cir. 2002)), cert. denied, 548 \nU.S. 1128 (2006). In this sense a judge acts as a gate-\nkeeper, guarding the courthouse doors from those who \nseek entry but have not yet satisfied mandatory pre-\nconditions to suit. Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741 (\u201cJuries de-\ncide cases, not issues of judicial traffic control.\u201d).  \nSecond, and relatedly, \u201c[t]he limitation imposed \nby the [Seventh] [A]mendment is merely that enjoy-\nment of the right of trial by jury be not obstructed, and \nthat the ultimate determination of issues of fact by the \njury be not interfered with.\u201d In re Peterson, 253 U.S. \n300, 310 (1920) (emphasis added). In other words, the \nSeventh Amendment \u201cis concerned with substance \nand not with form.\u201d Dimick v. Schiedt, 293 U.S. 474, \n490 (1935); see also id. (\u201cThere is nothing in its history \nor language to suggest that the amendment had any \npurpose but to preserve the essentials of the jury trial \nas it was known to the common law before the adop-\ntion of the Constitution.\u201d); Walker, 165 U.S. at 596 \n(\u201cSo long as this substance of right is preserved, the \nprocedure by which this result shall be reached is \nwholly within the discretion of the legislature . . . .\u201d). \nWhere the jury\u2019s ultimate determination of the facts is \nnot obviated, the judge may serve as factfinder. \n\n19 \n \nBoth of these underpinnings apply with full force \nin the exhaustion context. Exhaustion is a threshold \nquestion. Under the PLRA, \u201c[u]ntil the issue of ex-\nhaustion is resolved, the court cannot know whether \nit is to decide the case or the prison authorities are to.\u201d \nPavey, 544 F.3d at 741. Further, a judge\u2019s exhaustion \ndetermination does not interfere with a jury\u2019s ulti-\nmate factfinding responsibility because dismissals for \nfailure to exhaust are generally without prejudice.2 \nSee Snider v. Melindez, 199 F.3d 108, 111\u201312 (2d Cir. \n1999) (explaining that exhaustion \u201cis often a tempo-\nrary, curable, procedural flaw\u201d). A prisoner may later \nrefile the lawsuit, so long as the prison\u2019s grievance \nprocedure is satisfied. And if the prisoner\u2019s case ulti-\nmately proceeds to trial, the jury may revisit facts \nfound by the judge that may have been relevant to the \nexhaustion determination. See Part II; see also Pavey, \n544 F.3d at 742.  \nB. The Seventh Amendment does not pre-\nserve the right to a jury trial on any fac-\ntual questions concerning exhaustion be-\ncause exhaustion derives from equity.  \nAlthough the types of claims Richards brought are \nthose to which a jury trial applies, this Court has \n \n2 Along these lines, some courts have identified exhaustion as \nmatter in abatement, Bryant, 530 F.3d at 1374; Small, 728 F.3d \nat 269 n.3 (citation omitted), which is unsurprising since \u201cabate-\nment defense[s] defeat the particular action for procedural de-\nfects that are unrelated to the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claim,\u201d and \nthe plaintiff can therefore \u201ctypically correct the defects and pro-\nceed in another action,\u201d Hyman v. City of Gastonia, 466 F.3d 284, \n287 (4th Cir. 2006) (citing Bowles v. Wilke, 175 F.2d 35, 38 (7th \nCir. 1949)).  \n\n20 \n \nrecognized the need for a separate historical analysis \nfor particular issues or trial decisions within jury-ap-\npropriate claims. Under this analysis, there is no ex-\nact antecedent for exhaustion. But its equitable ori-\ngins and the characteristics of the doctrine show that \nits closest parallel lies in equitable defenses\u2014which \nwere historically decided by judges, not juries.  \n1. The Seventh Amendment guarantees \na jury trial right only as to issues \ntried by a jury in suits at common law \nat the time the Seventh Amendment \nwas adopted.  \nThe Seventh Amendment \u201cpreserve[s]\u201d the right \nto jury trial \u201c[i]n Suits at common law.\u201d U.S. Const. \namend. VII. Because the Amendment speaks in terms \nof preservation, this Court has long held that the \nscope of the right must be determined by reference to \nhistory. Indeed, \u201c[f]rom the beginning, it has been re-\ngarded as but subservient to the single purpose of the \nAmendment, to preserve the essentials of the jury \ntrial in actions at law, serving to distinguish them \nfrom suits in equity and admiralty[.]\u201d Dimick, 293 \nU.S. at 490\u201391 (citation omitted); Granfinanciera, \nS.A. v. Nordberg, 492 U.S. 33, 42 (1989) (explaining \nthat the Seventh Amendment applies to actions \u201cthat \nare analogous to common-law causes of action ordi-\nnarily decided in English law courts in the late 18th \ncentury, as opposed to those customarily heard by \ncourts of equity or admiralty\u201d) (citation omitted). Con-\nsistent with this command, \u201cresort must be had to the \nappropriate rules of the common law established at \nthe time of the adoption of that constitutional provi-\nsion in 1791.\u201d Dimick, 293 U.S. at 476. See also \n\n21 \n \nBaltimore & Carolina Line, Inc., 295 U.S. at 657 \n(\u201c[T]he right of trial by jury thus preserved is the right \nwhich existed under the English common law when \nthe Amendment was adopted.\u201d).  \nThis historical lens does not mean that the right \nto a jury trial is available only in suits \u201cwhich the com-\nmon law recognized among its old and settled proceed-\nings.\u201d Parsons v. Bedford, Breedlove & Robeson, 28 \nU.S. 433, 447 (1830). As this Court has noted, histori-\ncal analysis allows for reasoning by analogy. There-\nfore, the determination whether the Seventh Amend-\nment confers a right to a jury trial entails a two-part \ninquiry. A court first considers whether it is \u201c \u2018dealing \nwith a cause of action that either was tried at law at \nthe time of the founding or is at least analogous to one \nthat was.\u2019 \u201d City of Monterey v. Del Monte Dunes at \nMonterey, Ltd., 526 U.S. 687, 708 (1999) (quoting \nMarkman, 517 U.S. at 376). If a court determines that \n\u201cthe action in question belongs in the law category,\u201d it \nmust \u201cthen ask whether the particular trial decision \nmust fall to the jury in order to preserve the substance \nof the common-law right as it existed in 1791.\u201d Mark-\nman, 517 U.S. at 708 (emphasis added). See also Tull, \n481 U.S. at 426 (\u201c \u2018Only those incidents which are re-\ngarded as fundamental, as inherent in and of the es-\nsence of the system of trial by jury, are placed beyond \nthe reach of the legislature.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting Colgrove, 413 \nU.S. at 156 n.11.).  \nAs applied to this case, the first inquiry is \nstraightforward. While the scope of prisoners\u2019 federal \nrights was significantly limited at common law, see, \ne.g., Ruffin v. Commonwealth, 62 Va. 790, 799 (1871); \nBethea v. Crouse, 417 F.2d 504, 505 (10th Cir. 1969), \n\n22 \n \nfollowing Del Monte Dunes, 526 U.S. at 720\u201321, the \ntypes of claims that Richards brought\u2014\u00a7 1983 claims \nfor damages\u2014are those for which a jury trial applies.  \nThis conclusion is not the end of the inquiry, \nthough. Rather, it leads to the second question\u2014\nwhether the particular issue of exhaustion is \u201cproper \nfor determination by the jury.\u201d3 Id. at 718; see also id. \nat 731 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and in concurring \nin the judgment) (\u201cTo say that respondents had the \nright to a jury trial on their \u00a7 1983 claim is not to say \nthat they were entitled to have the jury decide every \nissue.\u201d); Google LLC v. Oracle Am., Inc. 593 U.S. 1, 25 \n(2021) (rejecting an argument that the jury should de-\ncide a fair-use defense). As explained below, it is not.  \n2. Exhaustion did not exist at the com-\nmon law, but closely analogous equi-\ntable issues were not decided by ju-\nries in 1791.  \nTo answer the second question\u2014whether exhaus-\ntion should be determined by a judge or jury\u2014this \nCourt again looks to history, asking \u201cwhether the par-\nticular issue, or analogous ones, were decided by judge \nor by jury in suits at common law at the time the Sev-\nenth Amendment was adopted.\u201d Del Monte Dunes, 526 \nU.S. at 718; see also Markman, 517 U.S. at 378 \n(\u201cWhere there is no exact antecedent, the best hope \n \n3 The practice of submitting some issues for judicial determina-\ntion, while others are submitted to the jury, is consistent with \nFed. R. Civ. P. 39(a) and (a)(2), which provides that a \u201ctrial on all \nissues so demanded must be by jury unless . . . the court . . . finds \nthat on some or all of those issues there is no federal right to a \njury trial.\u201d (Emphasis added).  \n\n23 \n \nlies in comparing the modern practice to earlier ones \nwhose allocation to court or jury we do know . . . seek-\ning the best analogy we can draw between an old and \nthe new.\u201d) (citations omitted); Tull, 481 U.S. at 420\u2013\n21 (explaining that courts must search the common \nlaw for \u201cappropriate analogies\u201d instead of a \u201cprecisely \nanalogous common-law cause of action\u201d). \nAlthough no exact antecedent for exhaustion ex-\nisted at common law, its origins lie in equity. These \norigins and exhaustion\u2019s characteristics result in an \nappropriate analog\u2014equitable defenses\u2014for which \nthere was no traditional right to a jury trial. \na. No historical antecedent to exhaustion \nexisted at common law, but its origins \nare equitable in nature. \nThe doctrine of exhaustion \u201cis as old as federal ad-\nministrative law,\u201d meaning that it did not begin to \ntake shape until the creation of the Interstate Com-\nmerce Commission in 1887. Raoul Berger, Exhaustion \nof Administrative Remedies, 48 Yale L.J. 981, 981 n.1 \n(1939). Intended as a rule of \u201corderly\u201d procedure de-\nsigned to allow administrative bodies to perform their \nstatutory functions without preliminary interference \nfrom the courts, United States v. Sing Tuck, 194 U.S. \n161, 168 (1904), the concept first arose in tax cases in \nwhich courts of equity refused to grant injunctive re-\nlief where a plaintiff failed to pursue administrative \nremedies.  \nIn Dundee Mortgage Trust Invest Co. v. Charlton, \n32 F. 192, 192\u201393 (C.C.D. Ore. 1887), for example, a \ncorporation brought suit in equity to enjoin the \n\n24 \n \ncollection of its taxes, arguing that the county asses-\nsor and county board of equalization had erred in their \nassessment. While the court agreed that the corpora-\ntion \u201cappear[ed] to be entitled to an injunction,\u201d id. at \n193, it nevertheless held that the corporation was not \nentitled to relief because it did not seek redress from \nthe county board of equalization, as provided by stat-\nute, id. at 193\u201394. \u201c[T]he plaintiff, having neglected to \navail itself of this means of redress, cannot maintain \na suit for relief in this court.\u201d Id. at 195; see also Alt-\nschul v. Gittings, 86 F. 200, 202 (C.C.D. Ore. 1898) \n(No. 2,236) (same); Brown v. Drain, 112 F. 582, 585 \n(C.C.S.D. Cal. 1901) (\u201cThe remedy of one who consid-\ners himself unfairly assessed is to apply for redress to \nthe statutory tribunal, if one is provided with the \npower to review.\u201d).  \nThe exhaustion concept was applied in courts of \nequity in other contexts as well. In Sing Tuck, an im-\nmigration case in which the Court denied a writ a ha-\nbeas corpus, the Court concluded that the petitioner \nfailed to comply with the \u201cmode of procedure which \nmust be followed before there can be resort to the \ncourts.\u201d 194 U.S. at 167. Explaining that \u201cit is one of \nthe necessities of the administration of justice that \neven fundamental questions should be determined in \nan orderly way,\u201d the Court reasoned that the peti-\ntioner failed to first file an appeal with the Secretary \nof Commerce and Labor. Id. at 168. The Court analo-\ngized the exhaustion requirement to habeas corpus \ncases arising out of state confinement:  \nA familiar illustration is that of a person im-\nprisoned upon criminal process by a state \ncourt, under a state law alleged to be \n\n25 \n \nunconstitutional. If the law is unconstitu-\ntional the prisoner is wrongfully held. Yet, ex-\ncept under exceptional circumstances, the \ncourts of the United States do not interfere by \nhabeas corpus. The prisoner must, in the first \nplace, take his case to the highest court of the \nstate to which he can go, and after that he gen-\nerally is left to the remedy by writ of error if \nhe wishes to bring the case here.  \nId. (citations omitted). Because the petitioner failed to \nfirst resort to his administrative remedy, any attempt \n\u201cto swamp the courts by resort to them in the first in-\nstance[ ] must fail.\u201d Id. at 170; see also id. (\u201c[B]efore \nthe courts can be called upon, the preliminary sifting \nprocess provided by the statutes must be gone through \nwith. Whether after that a further trial may be had \nwe do not decide.\u201d). Other cases highlight exhaustion\u2019s \nequitable origins. E.g. Pittsburgh Ry. v. Bd. of Pub. \nWorks, 172 U.S. 32, 47 (1898); United States v. Abilene \n& S. Ry. Co., 265 U.S. 274, 282 (1924); United States \nv. Ill. Cent. R.R. Co., 291 U.S. 457, 463 (1934); Natural \nGas Pipeline Co. v. Slattery, 302 U.S. 300, 310\u201311 \n(1937).  \nWhile these cases confirm exhaustion\u2019s equitable \norigins, the doctrine, as we understand it today, did \nnot fully emerge until the twentieth century. See John \nF. Duffy, Administrative Common Law in Judicial Re-\nview, 77 Tex. L. Rev. 113, 154 (1998) (explaining that \n\u201c[i]n the early part of th[e] [twentieth] century, the \ndoctrine was still quite amorphous, and as late as the \n1920\u2019s, courts were still using other equitable doc-\ntrines . . . to decide cases that would later be consid-\nered exhaustion precedents\u201d). Indeed, it was only in \n\n26 \n \n1938, in Myers v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Co., 303 \nU.S. 41 (1938), that this Court expressly articulated \nthe modern underpinning of the doctrine. See Duffy, \nsupra, at 155.  \nIn Myers, the Court declined a request to enjoin \nthe National Labor Relations Board\u2019s administrative \nproceedings despite allegations that the NLRB lacked \njurisdiction. Id. at 43, 46. The Court refused to grant \ninjunctive relief, in part on the ground that \u201cno one is \nentitled to judicial relief for a supposed or threatened \ninjury until the prescribed administrative remedy has \nbeen exhausted.\u201d Id. at 50. The Court recognized the \nexhaustion doctrine\u2019s equitable roots, see id. at 51 n.9 \n(\u201cThe rule has been most frequently applied in equity \nwhere relief by injunction was sought\u201d) (citation omit-\nted), and noted the extension of the doctrine to courts \nof law, id. (\u201cbecause the rule is one of judicial admin-\nistration\u2014not merely a rule governing the exercise of \ndiscretion\u2014it is applicable to proceedings at law as \nwell as suits in equity\u201d) (citations omitted). Myers \nstands as \u201cthe seminal decision\u201d on the exhaustion \ndoctrine and has been described as \u201ccomplet[ing] the \ndoctrine\u2019s evolution.\u201d Duffy, supra, at 155. \nIn short, although exhaustion has deep roots in \nequity, the doctrine as we know it today was unknown \nin the late eighteenth century. Consequently, there is \nno \u201cclear historical evidence that the very . . . ques-\ntion\u201d of exhaustion was a question for the jury under \nthe common law. Markman, 517 U.S. at 377. \n\n27 \n \nb. Traditional equitable defenses such as \nadequate remedy at law, forum non \nconveniens, abstention, and habeas \ncorpus bars are an appropriate com-\nmon-law analog for exhaustion.  \nWith no precise analog existing in the English \ncommon law, \u201cthe best hope lies in comparing the \nmodern practice to earlier ones whose allocation to \ncourt or jury we do know, . . . seeking the best analogy \nwe can draw between the old and the new.\u201d Markman, \n517 U.S. at 378 (citations omitted). In this regard, this \nCourt has instructed that the analog be \u201cappropriate\u201d \nrather than \u201cprecise[ ],\u201d Tull, 481 U.S. at 420\u201321, and \ncan be drawn on the basis of function, Markman, 517 \nU.S. at 379\u201380.  \nExhaustion\u2019s foundations in courts of equity pro-\nvide a logical starting point in the search for an appro-\npriate analog. As explained in the prior section, from \nits earliest articulations, it was viewed as a limitation, \nalbeit discretionary, on a court\u2019s equitable jurisdic-\ntion. See Charlton, 32 F. at 195; Altschul, 86 F. at 202. \nIn other words, a court of equity would not exercise its \nextraordinary powers where a plaintiff failed to avail \nitself of an available administrative process. Gorham \nMfg. Co. v. State Tax Comm\u2019n of N.Y., 266 U.S. 265, \n270 (1924) (holding that the petitioner, \u201chaving failed \nto avail itself of the administrative remedy provided \nby the statute . . . was not entitled to maintain a bill \nin equity\u201d); Ill. Cent. R.R. Co., 291 U.S. at 463 (\u201cThe \nvarious steps to be taken constitute parts of the ad-\nministrative process which must be completed before \nthe extraordinary powers of a court of equity may be \ninvoked.\u201d) (citation omitted); Slattery, 302 U.S. 300, \n310\u201311 (1937) (\u201cThe rule that a suitor must exhaust \n\n28 \n \nhis administrative remedies before seeking the ex-\ntraordinary relief of a court of equity . . . is of special \nforce when resort is had to the federal courts to re-\nstrain the action of state officers.\u201d) (citations omitted); \nIsland Creek Coal Co. v. Bryan, 937 F.3d 738, 748 (6th \nCir. 2019) (noting that \u201cthe exhaustion \u2018doctrine had \nits origin in a discretionary rule adopted by courts of \nequity to the effect that a petitioner will be denied eq-\nuitable relief when he has failed to pursue an availa-\nble administrative remedy by which he might obtain \nthe same relief.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting Smith v. United States, \n199 F.2d 377, 381 (1st Cir. 1952)).  \nThus, historically, exhaustion was an equitable \ndefense applied by courts when another forum\u2014an \nadministrative tribunal or agency\u2014was the more ap-\npropriate starting point for a dispute. Tracking this \nprinciple, this Court has said that exhaustion \u201cserves \nthe twin purposes of protecting administrative agency \nauthority and promoting judicial efficiency.\u201d McCar-\nthy v. Madigan, 503 U.S. 140, 145 (1992), superseded \nby statute, \u00a7 1997e(a), as recognized in Woodford, 548 \nU.S. at 84\u201385. As to the first purpose, the exhaustion \nrequirement \u201crecognizes the notion, grounded in def-\nerence to Congress\u2019 delegation of authority to coordi-\nnate branches of Government, that agencies, not the \ncourts, ought to have primary responsibility for the \nprograms that Congress has charged them to admin-\nister.\u201d Id.; see id. (\u201cThe exhaustion doctrine recognizes \nthe commonsense notion of dispute resolution that an \nagency ought to have an opportunity to correct its own \nmistakes . . . before it is haled into federal court.\u201d) (em-\nphasis added); Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 492 \n(1973) (\u201cSince the[ ] internal problems of state prisons \ninvolve issues so peculiarly within state authority and \n\n29 \n \nexpertise, the States have an important interest in not \nbeing bypassed in the correction of those problems.\u201d). \nAs to the second purpose, \u201c[w]hen an agency has the \nopportunity to correct its own errors, a judicial contro-\nversy may well be mooted, or at least piecemeal ap-\npeals may be avoided.\u201d McCarthy, 503 U.S. at 145 (ci-\ntations omitted).  \nThese twin purposes call back to early articula-\ntions of the exhaustion doctrine as a rule of \u201corderly\u201d \nprocedure. Sing Tuck, 194 U.S. at 168, 173. And alt-\nhough the exhaustion doctrine was discretionary, as \nopposed to jurisdictional, Slattery, 302 U.S. at 311 (ex-\nplaining that the rule \u201crests in the sound discretion \nwhich guides exercise of equity jurisdiction\u201d) (cita-\ntions omitted); Abilene & S. Ry. Co., 265 U.S. at 282, \nit nevertheless was treated by courts of equity as a \nthreshold inquiry, see Sing Tuck, 194 U.S. at 168, 170.  \nThese guideposts offer a clear path in the search \nfor an appropriate common law analog. Indeed, ex-\nhaustion\u2019s origins as a forum-based equitable defense \ncall to mind other similar equitable defenses\u2014the ad-\nequate remedy at law doctrine, forum non conveniens, \nabstention, and habeas corpus bars.  \nAdequate remedy at law. The adequate remedy at \nlaw doctrine was a fundamental principle guiding \ncourts of equity. These courts \u201cstood ready to fashion \nremedies for legal wrongs, so long as the basic require-\nments of equity\u2014such as irreparable injury and no \nadequate remedy at law\u2014were met.\u201d Duffy, supra, at \n124. See also Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 43\u201344 \n(1971) (\u201cOne is the basic doctrine of equity jurispru-\ndence that courts of equity should not act . . . when the \nmoving party has an adequate remedy at law and will \n\n30 \n \nnot suffer irreparable injury if denied equitable re-\nlief.\u201d); Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U.S. \n374, 381 (1992) (\u201cIt is a \u2018basic doctrine of equity juris-\nprudence that courts of equity should not act . . . when \nthe moving party has an adequate remedy at law[.]\u2019 \u201d) \n(citations omitted).  \nThe adequate remedy at law doctrine was \ngrounded in comity and federalism concerns, with fed-\neral equity courts refusing to provide relief where it \nwas available at law in federal courts of law, Great \nLakes Co. v. Huffman, 319 U.S. 293, 297 (1943) (cita-\ntion omitted), as well as in state proceedings, Trainor \nv. Hernandez, 431 U.S. 434, 441 (1977). This doctrine, \nlike exhaustion, thus focused on whether a court of eq-\nuity should defer to another court (or forum) to hear \nthe dispute. And, like exhaustion, courts viewed the \ndoctrine as a threshold issue. Brown, Bonnell & Co. v. \nLake Superior Iron Co., 134 U.S. 530, 536 (1890) (ex-\nplaining that the adequate remedy at law objection \n\u201cshould be taken at the earliest opportunity\u201d). \nForum non conveniens. Under this equitable, com-\nmon-law doctrine, a federal court may dismiss an ac-\ntion in favor of an alternative forum when, among \nother things, \u201cthe chosen forum [is] inappropriate be-\ncause of considerations affecting the court\u2019s own ad-\nministration and legal problems.\u201d Koster v. Am. Lum-\nbermens Mut. Cas. Co., 330 U.S. 518, 524 (1947); see \nalso Gulf Oil Corp. v. Gilbert, 330 U.S. 501, 506\u201307 \n(1947) (explaining that the doctrine is premised on the \nassumption that there are \u201cat least two forums in \nwhich the defendant is amenable to process\u201d). Both fo-\nrum non conveniens and exhaustion therefore permit \ncourts to consider judicial efficiency in deciding \n\n31 \n \nwhether they are the appropriate forum for a case to \nbe heard. See Sinochem Int\u2019l Co. v. Malaysia Int\u2019l \nShipping Corp., 549 U.S. 422, 432 (2007) (\u201cA district \ncourt . . . may dispose of an action by a forum non con-\nveniens dismissal, bypassing questions of subject-mat-\nter and personal jurisdiction, when considerations of \nconvenience, fairness, and judicial economy so war-\nrant.\u201d).  \nAbstention. \u201c[E]xhaustion of administrative reme-\ndies\u201d in general and \u201cabstention\u201d are \u201crelated doc-\ntrines.\u201d McCarthy, 503 U.S. at 144. As with exhaus-\ntion, the power of a federal court to dismiss a case via \nabstention \u201cderives from the discretion historically \nenjoyed by courts of equity.\u201d Quackenbush v. Allstate \nIns. Co., 517 U.S. 706, 728 (1996). The driving princi-\nples behind exhaustion and abstention also share a \ncommon root\u2014deference to state or administrative \nauthority.

Jacobs, 571 U.S. 69, \n72\u201373 (2013). Likewise, PLRA exhaustion requires a \nfederal court to stay its hand where a state has not \nhad its full opportunity to regulate its own prisons by \nconsidering a prisoner\u2019s grievance. \nHabeas Corpus. Federal habeas principles rein-\nforce the analogy between exhaustion and equitable \n\n32 \n \ndefenses. Indeed, this Court explicitly linked PLRA \nexhaustion requirements to certain habeas defenses, \ndeeming them \u201csubstantively similar.\u201d Woodford, 548 \nU.S. at 92; see also Schlesinger v. Councilman, 420 \nU.S. 738, 756 (1975) (noting that \u201cthe practical consid-\nerations supporting . . . the exhaustion requirement in \nhabeas corpus . . . are similar to those that underlie \nthe requirement of exhaustion of administrative rem-\nedies\u201d) (citation omitted).  \nHabeas exhaustion, like PLRA exhaustion, \nsounds in equity. Withrow v. Williams, 507 U.S. 680, \n699 (1993) (\u201cConcerns for equity and federalism reso-\nnate throughout our habeas jurisprudence.\u201d) (Scalia, \nJ., concurring in part); Erica Hashimoto, Reclaiming \nthe Equitable Heritage of Habeas, 108 Nw. U. L. Rev. \n139, 142 (2013) (habeas defenses \u201cshare features that \ncorrespond with the [habeas] remedy\u2019s historical equi-\ntable origins\u201d). Premised on the same equitable under-\npinnings as administrative exhaustion, habeas ex-\nhaustion requires a prisoner to avail himself of all \n\u201cavailable\u201d state-court remedies before entering fed-\neral court to seek a writ of habeas corpus. 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2254(c); see also O\u2019Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U.S. \n838, 847 (1999). \nThe doctrine of procedural default, 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2254(b)(1)(A), (c), another limitation on habeas re-\nlief, also shares similarities with exhaustion. It pre-\nvents federal court review of a claim that has not been \nproperly presented to the state courts. Woodford, 548 \nU.S. at 92. Procedural default guards against \u201cover-\nturning a state-court conviction without the state \ncourts having had an opportunity to correct the con-\nstitutional violation in the first instance.\u201d Id. (quoting \n\n33 \n \nO\u2019Sullivan, 526 U.S. at 845). That requirement mir-\nrors PLRA exhaustion\u2014giving prison systems the op-\nportunity to correct violations before litigating in fed-\neral court. See Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509, 518\u201319 \n(1982). \n3. Juries did not historically determine \nquestions of fact related to equitable \ndefenses analogous to exhaustion.  \nWith these similarities in mind, these equitable \ndefenses offer a sound analog to exhaustion, and \neighteenth-century practices concerning these de-\nfenses are instructive. It is well understood that a \nplaintiff is not entitled to have a jury determine a dis-\nputed affirmative defense that is equitable in nature. \nLiberty Oil Co. v. Condon Nat\u2019l Bank, 260 U.S. 235, \n242\u201343 (1922) (\u201cThe equitable defense makes the is-\nsue equitable, and it is to be tried to the judge as a \nchancellor.\u201d); Tull, 481 U.S. at 417 (\u201c[T]hose actions \nthat are analogous to 18th-century cases tried in \ncourts of equity . . . do not require a jury trial.\u201d) (cita-\ntion omitted); Granite State Ins. Co. v. Smart Modular \nTechs., 76 F.3d 1023, 1027 (9th Cir. 1996) (\u201cA litigant \nis not entitled to have a jury resolve a disputed affirm-\native defense if the defense is equitable in nature.\u201d) \n(citation omitted); Smith v. World Ins. Co., 38 F.3d \n1456, 1462 (8th Cir. 1994) (\u201c[T]he determination of eq-\nuitable defenses and equitable remedies is a matter \nfor the court to decide, not the jury.\u201d). This was true \neven where an equitable defense was \u201cinterposed in \n[an] action at law,\u201d in which circumstance the equita-\nble defense was generally \u201cfirst . . . disposed of as in a \ncourt of equity, and then, if an issue at law remain[ed], \nit [was] triable to a jury.\u201d Liberty Oil Co., 260 U.S. at \n\n34 \n \n242 (citations omitted). This equity-first order of oper-\nations was laid out by this Court over 100 years ago:  \nThe same order is preserved as under the sys-\ntem of separate courts. If a defendant at law \nhad an equitable defense, he resorted to a bill \nin equity to enjoin the suit at law, until he \ncould make his equitable defense effective by \na hearing before the chancellor. The hearing \non that bill was before the chancellor, and not \nbefore a jury, and, if the prayer of the bill was \ngranted, the injunction against the suit at law \nwas made perpetual, and no jury trial ensued. \nIf the injunction was denied, the suit at law \nproceeded to verdict and judgment. This was \nthe practice in the courts of law and chancery \nin England when our Constitution and the \nSeventh Amendment were adopted, and it is \nin the light of such practice that the Seventh \nAmendment is to be construed. \nId. at 243.  \n* * * \nIn sum, exhaustion was not part of the common \nlaw in 1791, and it has its origins in equity. This his-\ntorical background, along with exhaustion\u2019s func-\ntional similarities to forum-based equitable defenses \nsuch as adequate remedy at law, forum non conven-\niens, abstention, and habeas bars\u2014all historically \nnon-jury issues\u2014leads to the conclusion that the Sev-\nenth Amendment does not require juries to try ex-\nhaustion inquiries.  \n\n35 \n \n4. Functional considerations demon-\nstrate that judges, not juries, should \ndetermine exhaustion questions.  \nEven if history did not provide a clear answer, this \nCourt can, as a last resort, \u201clook elsewhere\u201d\u2015including \nat \u201cstatutory policies\u201d and the respective skills of \njudges and juries\u2015to inform the proper allocation be-\ntween a court or jury for purposes of the Seventh \nAmendment. Markman, 517 U.S. at 384; see also Del \nMonte Dunes, 526 U.S. at 718 (citation omitted). \nBeginning with the statutory policies at issue, the \nPLRA\u2019s statutory history is well documented. \u201cCon-\ngress enacted the [PLRA] . . . in 1996 in the wake of a \nsharp rise in prisoner litigation in the federal courts.\u201d \nWoodford, 548 U.S. at 84 (citing Alexander, 159 F.3d \nat 1324\u201325). The statute thus contains a variety of \ngatekeeping provisions \u201cdesigned to bring this litiga-\ntion under control.\u201d Id. (citations omitted). A \u201ccenter-\npiece\u201d of this effort is the PLRA\u2019s exhaustion require-\nment. Id. (citation omitted). \nThe PLRA\u2019s exhaustion requirement was, \u201cbeyond \ndoubt,\u201d \u201cenacted . . . to reduce the quantity and im-\nprove the quality of prisoner suits[.]\u201d Porter, 534 U.S. \nat 524. To this end, the provision \u201cafford[s] corrections \nofficials time and opportunity to address complaints \ninternally before allowing the initiation of a federal \ncase.\u201d Id. at 525 (emphasis added); see also Woodford, \n548 U.S. at 93 (\u201cThe PLRA attempts to eliminate un-\nwarranted federal-court interference with the admin-\nistration of prisons . . . .\u201d). This might \u201cobviat[e] the \nneed for litigation\u201d in some instances, or it might \u201cfil-\nter out some frivolous claims.\u201d Porter, 534 U.S. at 525 \n(citing Booth, 532 U.S. at 737). For cases that do make \n\n36 \n \nit to court, \u201cadjudication could be facilitated by an ad-\nministrative record that clarifies the contours of the \ncontroversy.\u201d Id. (citing Booth, 532 U.S. at 737); see \nalso Woodford, 548 U.S. at 95 (\u201cWhen a grievance is \nfiled shortly after the event giving rise to the griev-\nance, witnesses can be identified and questioned while \nmemories are still fresh, and evidence can be gathered \nand preserved.\u201d). These goals mirror the purposes of \ntraditional administrative exhaustion\u2014they safe-\nguard \u201cadministrative agency authority and pro-\nmot[e] judicial efficiency.\u201d McCarthy, 503 U.S. at 145.  \nThese goals would be severely undercut if a court \nwere to permit an exhaustion question to go to the \njury. Prison officials would be denied the opportunity \nto address and potentially rectify complaints inter-\nnally. Unexhausted claims could proceed to discovery \nwithout the benefits of full administrative record. \nMost critically, exhaustion questions would require ei-\nther a mini-jury trial before the merits adjudication or \na jury trial heard simultaneously with the merits. In \neither scenario, judicial resources and jurors\u2019 time \nwould be expended on claims that should never have \nreached the courthouse doors. Such a result directly \ncontradicts the PLRA\u2019s aims. \nOn the second point, judges\u2019 established role as \ngatekeepers in prisoner lawsuits supports the conclu-\nsion that judges, not juries, are \u201cbetter suited\u201d to as-\ncertain a prisoner\u2019s compliance with the exhaustion \nrequirement. See Markman, 517 U.S. at 384, 388\u201389 \n(consulting \u201cexisting precedent\u201d and considering \u201cthe \nrelative interpretive skills of judges and juries\u201d); Del \nMonte Dunes, 526 U.S. at 720 (looking to \u201cconsidera-\ntions of process and function\u201d). As explained in Part \n\n37 \n \nI(A), judges routinely resolve threshold issues and act \nas gatekeepers on factual questions that would other-\nwise be presented to the jury. This is especially true \nin PLRA cases, where, due to the sheer volume of pris-\noner lawsuits, Alexander, 159 F.3d at 1324, judges are \nwell-acquainted with the internal operations of prison \nsystems and their multi-level grievance processes. \nThe screening requirement of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A rein-\nforces this notion, as judges already ensure compli-\nance with other aspects of the PLRA. This knowledge \nbase has well prepared the judiciary to settle ques-\ntions surrounding exhaustion under the PLRA. \nThese considerations provide sufficient reason to \ntreat the disposition of questions of fact concerning ex-\nhaustion like many other factfinding responsibilities \nceded to judges in the normal course of litigation.  \nII. The Seventh Amendment does not preserve \nthe right to a jury trial on factual questions \nconcerning exhaustion even when those fac-\ntual questions are intertwined with the un-\nderlying merits. \nAt common law, the Seventh Amendment did not \npreserve the right to a jury trial on equitable defenses \nsuch as exhaustion. Following the merger of the courts \nof law and equity in 1938, however, courts have recog-\nnized that \u201c[d]ifficulties may arise . . . when the legal \nand equitable issues overlap and the evidence is inter-\ntwined.\u201d Danjaq LLC v. Sony Corp., 263 F.3d 942, 962 \n(9th Cir. 2001); Ross v. Bernhard, 396 U.S. 531, 536\u2013\n39 (1970). This Court has held that, as a prudential \nmatter, where factual issues overlap between legal \nand equitable issues, jury-triable issues should \n\n38 \n \ngenerally be prioritized. See, e.g., Beacon Theatres, \n359 U.S. at 510\u201311; Dairy Queen, Inc. v. Wood, 369 \nU.S. 469, 472\u201373 (1962).  \nBut exhaustion remains a threshold precondition \nto suit that, by its nature, must be determined before \nthe merits. With that that order of operation in mind, \nthis Court has applied the Beacon Theatres principle \nonly where an equitable claim could, through collat-\neral estoppel or res judicata, bar a subsequent jury \ntrial on a legal claim. Exhaustion does not present \nsuch a circumstance. And, in any event, this Court has \nconsidered departure from the Beacon Theatres pru-\ndential rule when it would undercut congressional in-\ntent, as it would here. For these reasons, Richards \ndoes not have a jury trial right on factual questions \nconcerning exhaustion\u2014even when those questions \nare intertwined with the merits of his claims.  \nA. Beacon Theatres created a presumption \nthat juries should decide intertwined le-\ngal and equitable issues, but that pre-\nsumption does not apply here.  \nBeacon Theatres stands for the proposition that, \nwhere legal and equitable claims are grounded in the \nsame set of facts, the right to a jury trial on the legal \nclaims should prevail, precluding a prior determina-\ntion of the equitable claims. This \u201cgeneral prudential \nrule,\u201d Parklane Hosiery, 439 U.S. at 334, is primarily \nconcerned with the collateral estoppel or res judicata \neffect that an inverse ordering would present, id. See \nalso Katchen v. Landy, 382 U.S. 323, 339\u201340 (1966) \n(explaining that Beacon Theatres announced an \u201cequi-\ntable doctrine,\u201d not a bright-line rule). Consequently, \n\n39 \n \nall order-of-trial problems should, \u201cwherever possi-\nble,\u201d be resolved in favor of granting a jury trial to pre-\nserve the Seventh Amendment right. Beacon Thea-\ntres, 359 U.S. at 510. The resolution of an exhaustion \nquestion, however, does not present such a scenario.  \nBeacon Theatres involved a dispute between two \ntheatres regarding the validity of contracts in which \nthe film distributors had given one of the theatres, \nFox, the exclusive right to show \u201cfirst run pictures\u201d in \nthe area. Id. at 502. Because another theatre, Beacon, \n\u201cnotified Fox that it considered [the] contracts . . . to \nbe overt acts in violation of antitrust laws,\u201d id., Fox \nfiled suit seeking both declaratory judgment and an \ninjunction against Beacon asserting an antitrust \nclaim against it. Id. at 502\u201303. Beacon then filed a \ncounterclaim and cross-claim that the contracts vio-\nlated antitrust laws and requested treble damages. Id. \nat 503. Despite an issue of common fact among the \ncomplaint and counterclaim and Beacon\u2019s request for \na jury trial on legal issues, the district court ordered \nFox\u2019s claims, which were traditional suits in equity, to \nbe tried by the court before a determination of Bea-\ncon\u2019s claims. Id. at 503\u201304. The court of appeals af-\nfirmed, holding that the district judge could try the \nequitable claim first, even if it might preclude a jury \ntrial on the legal claims. Id. at 505.  \nThis Court disagreed. Reasoning that trying the \nequitable claims first could, by way of collateral estop-\npel or res judicata, bar a subsequent trial on the mer-\nits of Beacon\u2019s legal claims, the Court held that order-\nof-trial problems be resolved in favor of granting a \njury trial unless there are \u201cimperative circumstances, \ncircumstances which in view of the flexible procedures \n\n40 \n \nof the Federal Rules we cannot now anticipate.\u201d Id. at \n508; see id. at 504 (\u201c[I]f Beacon would have been enti-\ntled to a jury trial in a treble damage suit against Fox, \nit cannot be deprived of the right merely because Fox \ntook advantage of the availability of declaratory relief \nto sue Beacon first.\u201d); see also Parklane Hosiery, 439 \nU.S. at 333 (\u201cRecognition that an equitable determi-\nnation could have collateral-estoppel effect in a subse-\nquent legal action was the major premise of . . . Beacon \nTheatres.\u201d).  \nDairy Queen, decided three years later, involved \nsimilar timing concerns. There, the claims were both \nlegal (monetary damages for breach of contract) and \nequitable (relief in the form of injunction), and the dis-\ntrict court denied the defendants\u2019 demand for a jury \ntrial on the ground that the jury claim was only \u201cinci-\ndental\u201d to the non-jury claim. 369 U.S. at 470. This \nCourt, relying on Beacon Theatres, explained that \u201cthe \nright to trial by jury may [not] be lost as to legal issues \nwhere those are characterized as \u2018incidental\u2019 to equi-\ntable issues.\u201d Id. Again, the Court was concerned with \nthe preclusive effect that a determination on equitable \nissues would have on legal ones. Id. at 472\u201373. \nBeacon Theatres is therefore instructive in deter-\nmining the order of trial on merits-based arguments. \nWhere a party has a right to a jury trial on a legal \nclaim, the order of trial should be arranged to preserve \nthat right. This is consistent with \u201c[t]he limitation im-\nposed by the [Seventh] [A]mendment . . . that the ul-\ntimate determination of issues of fact by the jury be \nnot interfered with.\u201d In re Peterson, 253 U.S. at 310 \n(emphasis added); see also Markman, 517 U.S. at 377 \n(asking \u201cwhether a particular issue . . . is itself \n\n41 \n \nnecessarily a jury issue, the guarantee being essential \nto preserve the right to a jury\u2019s resolution of the ulti-\nmate dispute\u201d). \nExhaustion questions, whether intertwined with \nthe merits or not, do not raise the same concerns as \nthose in Beacon Theatres for two interrelated reasons. \nFirst, unlike the substantive claims in Beacon Thea-\ntres, exhaustion is a threshold precondition to reach-\ning the merits. Second, unlike the concerns of collat-\neral estoppel or res judicata in Beacon Theatres, a \njudge\u2019s factual findings on exhaustion would not pre-\nclude a jury\u2019s ability to consider those same facts when \ndetermining the merits of the legal claim.  \n1. The presumption does not apply be-\ncause exhaustion is a threshold issue \nthat is logically precedent to the mer-\nits.  \nBeacon Theatres involved competing causes of ac-\ntion\u2014claims for declaratory and injunctive relief on \nthe one hand and claims for treble damages on the \nother. Under the historical equity-first order of opera-\ntions, see Liberty Oil Co., 260 U.S. at 242, the latter \nmerits claims would have been bound by the determi-\nnation of the former and thus never tried before a jury. \nThis Court held that this would violate the Seventh \nAmendment.  \nNo such scenario is present here. Unlike the \nclaims at issue in Beacon Theatres, exhaustion is a \nthreshold precondition to suit that, by its nature, \nmust be determined before the merits. Given that it is \na rule of \u201corderly\u201d procedure, Sing Tuck, 194 U.S. at \n\n42 \n \n168, \u201c[u]ntil the issue of exhaustion is resolved, a \ncourt cannot know whether it is to decide the case or \nthe prison authorities are to,\u201d Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741. \nSee also Perez v. Wis. Dep\u2019t of Corr., 182 F.3d 532, 534 \n(7th Cir. 1999) (explaining that exhaustion is \u201cde-\nsigned to prevent [a] decision on the merits\u201d). To do \notherwise would flip exhaustion on its head\u2014defer-\nence to agency authority would be bypassed and judi-\ncial efficiency lost. See McCarthy, 503 U.S. at 145; Pe-\nrez, 182 F.3d at 534 (explaining that \u201c[e]xamining the \nmerits first and then ordering a case dismissed on ex-\nhaustion grounds . . . would disregard the statutory \napproach\u201d).  \nBecause exhaustion is a threshold issue, it does \nnot have any bearing on a prisoner\u2019s jury trial right. \nIndeed, \u201c \u2018[t]he Seventh Amendment does not confer \nthe right to a trial, but only the right to have a jury \nhear the case once it is determined that the litigation \nshould proceed before a court.\u2019 \u201d Caley, 428 F.3d at \n1372 (quoting Am. Heritage Life Ins. Co., 294 F.3d at \n711); see also Sydnor v. Conseco Fin. Serv. Corp., 252 \nF.3d 302, 307 (4th Cir. 2001) (same). In contrast to \nBeacon Theatres, in which there were competing equi-\ntable and legal causes of action, exhaustion presents \na threshold precondition to suit. Legal claims that are \nsubject to trial by jury may be tried by that jury only \nafter determination of the threshold issue. Beacon \nTheatres is therefore distinguishable and does not \ncompel a different result.  \n\n43 \n \n2. The presumption does not apply be-\ncause a judge\u2019s factual findings re-\ngarding exhaustion would not pre-\nclude a jury\u2019s consideration of the \nsame facts when determining the \nmerits of the legal claim.  \nThis case differs from Beacon Theatres for a sec-\nond reason. A jury can reexamine factual determina-\ntion made by a judge regarding exhaustion when de-\nciding the merits of the claim.  \nBoth Beacon Theatres and Dairy Queen involved \ncircumstances in which the right to a jury trial on a \nlegal issue would be lost through the determination of \nan equitable issue. And Beacon Theatres itself recog-\nnized that there would be cases in which a trial court \nhas \u201cdiscretion in deciding whether the legal or equi-\ntable cause should be tried first,\u201d 359 U.S. at 510, \nkeeping in mind that this discretion \u201cmust, wherever \npossible, be exercised to preserve jury trial.\u201d Id. See \nalso Markman, 517 U.S. at 377 (asking whether the \njury must hear this question to \u201cpreserve the \u2018sub-\nstance of the common-law right of trial by jury\u2019 \u201d) \n(quoting Tull, 481 U.S. at 426) (emphasis omitted). \nHere, that right can be preserved through a jury\u2019s \nability to reexamine the fact questions common to ex-\nhaustion and the underlying legal claim at trial. As \nexplained in Pavey:  \n[A]ny finding that the judge makes, relating \nto exhaustion, that might affect the merits \nmay be reexamined by the jury if\u2014and only \nafter\u2014the prisoner overcomes the exhaustion \ndefense and the case proceeds to the merits. \n544 F.3d at 742.  \n\n44 \n \nThis approach is consistent with the \u201cflexible\u201d na-\nture of collateral estoppel. Duvall v. Att\u2019y Gen. of the \nUnited States, 436 F.3d 382, 390 (3d Cir. 2006) \n(\u201cCourts and commentators have consistently recog-\nnized that collateral estoppel was borne of equity and \nis therefore \u2018flexible,\u2019 bending to satisfy its underlying \npurpose in light of the nature of the proceedings.\u201d) (ci-\ntation omitted); United States v. Stauffer Chem. Co., \n464 U.S. 165, 176 (1984) (White, J., concurring) (ex-\nplaining that collateral estoppel \u201cis a flexible, judge-\nmade doctrine\u201d). Cf. Parklane Hosiery, 439 U.S. at 331 \n(explaining that trial courts have \u201cbroad discretion\u201d in \ndetermining \nwhen \noffensive \ncollateral \nestoppel \n\u201cshould be applied\u201d). \nPavey\u2019s pragmatic approach disposes of the pri-\nmary concern at issue in Beacon Theatres and Dairy \nQueen\u2014namely, that the \u201cright to a jury trial of legal \nissues [would] be lost through prior determination of \nequitable claims.\u201d 359 U.S. at 511 (citation omitted). \nFollowing Pavey\u2019s approach, \u201c[i]f and when the judge \ndetermines that the prisoner has properly exhausted \nhis administrative remedies, the case will proceed to \npretrial discovery, and if necessary a trial, on the mer-\nits[.]\u201d 544 F.3d at 742; see also id. at 741 (explaining \nthat \u201cin many cases the only consequence of a failure \nto exhaust is that the prisoner must go back to the \nbottom rung of the administrative ladder\u201d).4 Then, \u201cif \nthere is a jury trial, the jury will make all necessary \nfindings of fact without being bound by (or even \n \n4 This approach also allays the concerns in Fireman\u2019s Fund, \nwhich the Sixth Circuit relied on below, that \u201cthe merits of a con-\ntroversy could be summarily decided\u201d \u201cwithout the ordinary inci-\ndents of trial.\u201d 253 F.2d at 784 (citing Smithers v. Smith, 204 \nU.S. 632, 645 (1907)).  \n\n45 \n \ninformed of) any of the findings made by the district \njudge in determining that the prisoner had exhausted \nhis administrative remedies.\u201d5 Id. In short, the \u201csub-\nstance of the common-law right of trial by jury\u201d is pre-\nserved. Colgrove, 413 U.S. at 156.  \nOf course, some prisoners will be unable to refile \ntheir lawsuit after a judge\u2019s determination that they \nfailed to properly exhaust administrative remedies. \nSee Pavey, 544 F.3d at 742 (explaining that where a \njudge decides that \u201cthe failure to exhaust was the pris-\noner\u2019s fault . . . the case is over\u201d). But this is simply a \nconsequence of the exhaustion requirement function-\ning as intended. See, e.g., Woodford, 548 U.S. at 89\u2013\n92 (discussing the purposes of exhaustion); id. at 95 \n(\u201cA prisoner who does not want to participate in the \nprison grievance system will have little incentive to \ncomply with the system\u2019s procedural rules unless non-\ncompliance carries a sanction.\u201d). And again, this con-\nsequence has no bearing on the Seventh Amendment, \nwhich guarantees a jury trial only after it is deter-\nmined that the case belongs in court.  \n \n5 As recognized in Pavey, the ability of a prisoner to refile a case \nafter proper exhaustion \u201cdistinguishes the issue of exhaustion \nfrom [other] deadline lines issues that juries decide.\u201d Id. at 741. \nFor example, \u201c[a] statute of limitations defense if successfully in-\nterposed ends the litigation rather than shunting it to another \nforum.\u201d Id.; see also Messa, 652 F.3d at 309\u201310 (explaining that \nthe doctrines of exhaustion and statutes of limitations \u201cplay . . . \nimportant\u2014and distinct\u2014roles in our system of justice\u201d) (cita-\ntion omitted).  \n\n46 \n \nB. Unlike in Beacon Theatres, a judicial de-\ntermination of exhaustion would imple-\nment congressional intent.  \nEven assuming Beacon Theatres applies generally \nto threshold issues that would not implicate the jury\u2019s \nultimate determination of the merits, its presumption \nshould not apply in the PLRA exhaustion context.  \nPost-Beacon Theatres, this Court has noted the \nlimitations of its order-of-trial presumption. In \nKatchen, for example, the Court explained that \u201c[b]oth \nBeacon Theatres and Dairy Queen recognize that \nthere might be situations in which the Courts could \nproceed to resolve the equitable claims first even \nthough the results might be dispositive of the issues \ninvolved in the legal claim.\u201d 382 U.S. at 339 (emphasis \nadded). The Katchen Court addressed \u201cthe mode of \nprocedure for trying out the issue\u201d of voidable prefer-\nences against an estate in bankruptcy proceedings. \n382 U.S. at 325, 326. Recognizing the equitable juris-\ndiction of bankruptcy courts and the \u201cspecific statu-\ntory scheme contemplating the prompt trial of a dis-\nputed claim but without the intervention of a jury,\u201d \nthis Court permitted a bankruptcy court to decide the \npreference issues in an equitable proceeding notwith-\nstanding the argument that it would \u201crender unneces-\nsary a trial in a [legal] action.\u201d Id. at 336, 339. The \nCourt rejected the petitioner\u2019s reliance on Beacon The-\natres and Dairy Queen, noting that the rule of those \ncases \u201cis itself an equitable doctrine\u201d and that appli-\ncation of the rule would \u201cdismember a scheme which \nCongress has prescribed.\u201d Id. at 339; see also id. at \n339\u201340 (\u201cBoth Beacon Theatres and Dairy Queen rec-\nognize that there might be situations in which the \nCourt could proceed to resolve the equitable claim \n\n47 \n \nfirst even though the results might be dispositive of \nthe issues involved in the legal claim.\u201d); but see Gran-\nfinanciera, 492 U.S. at 58\u201359 (noting the limitations \non the scope of Congress\u2019s ability to \u201cdivest [parties] of \ntheir Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial\u201d).  \nAs in Katchen, this case involves a specific statu-\ntory scheme whose purpose would be compromised ab-\nsent prompt resolution of disputed facts by the court. \nSee Katchen, 383 U.S. at 339. Congress passed the \nPLRA \u201cto reduce the quantity and improve the quality \nof prisoner suits.\u201d Porter, 534 U.S. at 524. The \u201cinvig-\norated\u201d exhaustion requirements is the \u201ccenterpiece\u201d \nof this legislation, Woodford, 548 U.S. at 84, and it \nserves dual purposes. It allows prisons to rectify their \nown mistakes before they are \u201chaled into federal \ncourt,\u201d id. at 89, and promotes judicial efficiency by \nreducing litigation and creating an administrative \nrecord for the litigation that does occur, id. \nAllowing potentially unexhausted claims to pro-\nceed to a jury trial subverts both purposes. See also \nPart I(B)(4). This subversion is further reason why the \nprudential rule set forth in Beacon Theatres should \nnot apply to PLRA exhaustion.  \nThat an exhaustion question is intertwined with \nthe merits of a prisoner\u2019s claim does not transform ex-\nhaustion into a jury-triable issue. Exhaustion is a \nthreshold issue that is logically precedent to the mer-\nits. And Beacon Theatres\u2019 presumption would not ap-\nply where any judicial determination of overlapping \nfacts remains subject to later review by a jury in a trial \non the merits. Finally, that a judicial determination of  \n \n \n\n48 \n \nexhaustion would implement congressional intent \nserves as yet another reason why Beacon Theatres\u2019 \nprudential rule should not apply to exhaustion ques-\ntions. \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be  \nreversed.  \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nAnn M.
