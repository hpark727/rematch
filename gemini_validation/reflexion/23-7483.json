    "legal_questions": [
      "When revoking supervised release and imposing a prison sentence, may a district court consider the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2014namely, 'the seriousness of the offense,' 'promot[ing] respect for the law,' and 'just punishment'\u2014even though these factors are not explicitly referenced in the supervised release statute?"

      "No"
    ],
    "facts_of_the_case": "In January 2020, Edgardo Esteras began a six-year term of supervised release following imprisonment for drug trafficking offenses. Three years into his supervised release, in January 2023, his probation officer reported violations including domestic violence and firearm possession, though the related criminal charges were dismissed at the victim's request. At a violation hearing, Judge Pearson found that Esteras had possessed a firearm while on supervised release. Concerned that previous sentences had failed to deter him, she imposed an above-guidelines sentence of 24 months\u2019 imprisonment plus three years of supervised release with special conditions including anger management and location monitoring. Though Esteras objected to the court\u2019s consideration of certain statutory factors related to punishment, Judge Pearson maintained that she also weighed deterrence and public safety, while acknowledging that some supervision conditions had both punitive and rehabilitative aspects.\n\nOn appeal, Esteras challenged his sentence on the ground that the district court relied on prohibited factors in sentencing him, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed.",

This information is absolutely critical to move beyond the high-level case summary and begin a substantive legal analysis necessary for prediction. Without it, any prediction would be guesswork.\n\nDesign EIG is also high (0.8) because it tests and confirms a core principle of the prediction strategy: that a deep analysis must begin with the petitioner's own framing of the issue. Evaluating how the petition structures the argument, presents the circuit split, and invokes precedent is a fundamental and repeatable step in the analysis of any SCOTUS case. Successfully using this document reinforces the validity and efficiency of this core strategic workflow.\n\nThe joint EIG is therefore very high, as this action is essential for both the specific task and for validating a cornerstone of the general prediction methodology.",

Without it, any prediction would be superficial.\n\nDesign EIG is high (0.7) because it validates a critical and efficient workflow strategy: starting the analysis with the primary source document that initiated the SCOTUS case.

However, it is a crucial enabling step. The agent is currently blocked from accessing the core documents (like the petition). This thought process directly unblocks the agent by creating a high-probability path to finding those documents. The information gain is in formulating a successful strategy to acquire task-relevant data, which is a significant step towards making a prediction.\n\nDesign EIG (0.8): This action is a prime example of the agent learning a generalizable and valuable heuristic for interacting with its environment: 'When specific, filtered searches fail, broaden the search to get an overview before refining.' This is a powerful lesson in information retrieval strategy that will be applicable across all future cases, improving the agent's overall effectiveness and robustness. It's a strong update to the agent's model of how to use its tools effectively.\n\nJoint EIG (1.4): The action is highly valuable because it both solves an immediate impasse in the current task and provides a significant, reusable lesson for the agent's general design.",

These documents are the primary sources for understanding the legal arguments of both parties, the precise nature of the circuit split (if any), and the reasoning being challenged. Moving from a brief summary to the full text of the legal arguments provides a massive increase in the information needed to make an informed prediction.\n\nDesign EIG (0.4): The action tests a fundamental strategic principle: begin any case analysis by gathering the primary source documents. While this is a basic strategy, confirming its effectiveness and observing the specific types of documents returned is valuable for refining the agent's standard operating procedure. It reinforces a core, high-utility step in the workflow. The insight is not novel, but it is a crucial validation of a cornerstone of the prediction process, hence a moderate score.\n\nJoint EIG (1.3): The combination of extremely high task-specific value and moderate, foundational design value makes this a very strong action.

Under the Government\u2019s telling, those factors \nare nevertheless permissible to consider; in fact, it is \nimpossible not to, and Congress had no apparent reason \nfor choosing to omit Section 3553(a)(2)(A) from the list.\nThere was a reason: Congress omitted factors that it \nintended to preclude. That was the Government\u2019s previous \nposition, which reflects a traditional rule of statutory \nconstruction: expressio unius est exclusio alterius. The \nGovernment spends much of its brief arguing that there \nare other ways to preclude relying on certain factors, such \nas by using the word \u201conly.\u201d But those methods are not \nnecessary when the text is otherwise clear, as it is here.\nCongress precluded courts from relying on Section \n3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution factors to keep retributive \npunishment out of supervised-release considerations, both \nwhen courts impose supervised release and when they \nterminate, modify, or revoke it.1 That is consistent with \nthe text of Section 3583(c) and (e), the textual differences \nbetween Section 3583 and neighboring statutes, and the \n1.\u2002 The Government claims that \u201cretributive punishment\u201d is \n\u201csimply petitioners\u2019 gloss\u201d on Section 3553(a)(2)(A). Gov\u2019t Br. at \n35. Not so. It reflects how both this Court and the Senate Report \nhave described Section 3553(a)(2)(A). See Tapia v. United States, \n564 U.S. 319, 326 (2011) (noting that \u201cretribution\u201d is \u201cthe first \npurpose listed in \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)\u201d); S. Rep. No. 98-225, at 75 (1983) \n(explaining that the \u201cfirst purpose listed\u201d in Section 3553(a)(2) is \n\u201cessentially the \u2018just deserts\u2019 concept\u201d).\n\n2\nhistory of the Sentencing Reform Act. In particular, \nit reflects the textual differences between the statutes \ngoverning probation and governing supervised release, \nconsistent with the different histories and structures of \nthose provisions.\nThe Government\u2019s contrary approach is inconsistent \nwith the text and the history of the statute. It is also \ninternally inconsistent, claiming that precluding omitted \nfactors is not feasible but also that Congress did so \nelsewhere. And it introduces intractable interpretive \nproblems, assigning different meanings to provisions with \nthe same listed factors (Sections 3583(c) and (e)) but the \nsame meaning to provisions with different listed factors \n(Sections 3565(a) and 3583(e)).\nCongress\u2019s deliberate choice to preclude relying \non Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution factors was not a \nsemantic formality. Congress took a different approach \nto imposing and to terminating, modifying, and revoking \nsupervised release than it did with all other federal \nsentencing options. Following the text as written is \na practicable framework that implements Congress\u2019s \nsubstantive design for supervised release.\nI.\t The Government\u2019s approach would render \nmeaningless Congress\u2019s deliberate choice to exclude \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A) from Section 3583(e)\u2019s list of \nfactors.\nCongress made a deliberate choice to omit Section \n3553(a)(2)(A) from Section 3583(e)\u2019s list of factors, and \nthat choice was not meaningless. It precludes courts \nfrom considering the (a)(2)(A) factors when terminating, \nmodifying, or revoking supervised release.\n\n3\nThe Government contrasts Section 3583(e) with \nseveral other provisions, but the key comparison is with \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03565(a), which applies when courts modify \nor revoke probation. The two provisions use identical \nlanguage except for different listed factors. Compare 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03565(a) (permitting a court to modify or revoke \nprobation \u201cafter considering the factors set forth in section \n3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable\u201d), with 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(e) (permitting a court to modify or revoke \nsupervised release \u201cafter considering the factors set forth in \nsection 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), \n(a)(6), and (a)(7)\u201d). The only interpretation that gives \neffect to the textual difference between the statutes is \nthat Section 3583(e) precludes courts from relying on the \n(a)(2)(A) factors. Under the Government\u2019s interpretation, \nthe two provisions would mean the same thing\u2014consider \nany factors to the extent that they apply\u2014and Congress\u2019s \ndecision to omit Section 3553(a)(2)(A) in Section 3583(e) \nwould be meaningless. See Pet. Br. at 13, 21-22. The \nGovernment\u2019s brief does not mention Section 3565(a).\nThe negative-implication canon, expressio unius \nest exclusio alterius, is strongest when text is included \nin one statute but omitted from a neighbor. Bittner v. \nUnited States, 598 U.S. 85, 94 (2023). It is even stronger \nwhen the neighboring statutes use otherwise-identical \nlanguage. And it gives effect to Congress\u2019s deliberate \nchoice to exclude Section 3553(a)(2)(A) from the list in \nSection 3583(e).\nThe Government\u2019s approach also would make the \nomission in Section 3583(e) meaningless in another way. \nAlthough the Government says the omission means that the \nlisted factors are mandatory and the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) \n\n4\nfactors are permissive, Gov\u2019t Br. at 16-17, it also says that \nthe factors \u201cinherently overlap,\u201d id. at 16, and further that \nit is \u201call but impossible,\u201d id. at 20, and not \u201cfeasible,\u201d id. \nat 35, to consider the listed factors without considering \nthe (a)(2)(A) factors. Thus, according to the Government, \nSection 3583(e) permits courts to consider the (a)(2)(A) \nfactors while mandating the rest, but it is impossible to \nconsider the rest without considering the (a)(2)(A) factors, \nso a statute in which Congress deliberately chose to omit \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A) actually mandates considering \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A).\nCongress\u2019s decision to omit Section 3553(a)(2)(A) \nwas not meaningless. It precludes courts from considering \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution factors when \nterminating, modifying, or revoking supervised release.\nII. The Government\u2019s approach creates conflicts with \nother provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act that \nthe plain text avoids.\nThe Government claims that interpreting Section \n3583(e) to preclude relying on the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) \nfactors would conflict with other provisions of the SRA. \nThat is not accurate. The Government\u2019s approach, not \npetitioners\u2019, would create new interpretive problems, \nincluding reading identical text in the same provision to \nmean different things.\na.\u2003 The Government argues that Congress could have \nused the word \u201conly\u201d or similar language to indicate that \nthe omitted factor was precluded. Gov\u2019t Br. at 23. True \nenough. Congress also could have done what it did here\u2014\nused the \u201cancient maxim\u201d of expressio unius est exclusio \n\n5\nalterius, Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of R.R. \nPassengers, 414 U.S. 453, 458 (1974), to convey the same \nmeaning. Using additional limiting language was not \nnecessary, particularly given the close textual similarities \nbetween Sections 3565(a) and 3583(e).\nThe Government asserts that, because Congress used \nthe word \u201conly\u201d or other limiting language in unrelated \ncontexts elsewhere in Section 3583, Congress could not \nhave meant to preclude relying on Section 3553(a)(2)(A) \nwithout using the word \u201conly\u201d in Section 3583(e). Gov\u2019t \nBr. at 24, 27-29. That conclusion does not follow. There are \nseveral provisions throughout the SRA where Congress \ndid not use \u201conly\u201d but indisputably limited court actions \nto what is stated. Section 3583(e) itself states that a court \nmay terminate supervised release, extend or modify it, \nrevoke it, or impose home confinement. See 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a03583(e). It does not say that a court may do \u201conly\u201d those \nthings, but the same principle\u2014the negative-implication \ncanon\u2014dictates that the listed actions are the only options \navailable, and not, say, imposing a fine. See Barnhart v. \nPeabody Coal Co., 537 U.S. 149, 168 (2003) (noting that \nthe negative-implication canon has \u201cforce\u201d when \u201cthe \nitems expressed are members of an associated group or \nseries, justifying the inference that items not mentioned \nwere excluded by deliberate choice, not inadvertence\u201d). \nSimilarly, Section 3583(e)(3) states that a court may \nrevoke supervised release if it finds by a preponderance \nof the evidence that the defendant violated a condition \nof supervised release. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(e). It does \nnot say \u201conly,\u201d but Congress\u2019s meaning again is clear: \na court may not revoke supervised release when it does \nnot find that a person violated a condition, and it may not \napply a different burden of proof. Congress used \u201conly\u201d \n\n6\nwhen it was necessary to do so, as in Section 3583(d) \nwhen specifying the limited circumstances under which \nintermittent confinement could be imposed. See 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a03583(d) (discussing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03563(b)(10)). Congress \ndid not when its meaning was otherwise clear, as when \nit omitted Section 3553(a)(2)(A) from the lists in Section \n3583(c), (d), and (e).\nEven the Government recognizes that the negative-\nimplication canon still applies in Section 3583(e). It \nargues that petitioners ask the Court to make the \u201cwrong \ninference,\u201d though, because the canon applies to \u201cafter \nconsidering\u201d but not to the listed and omitted factors. \nGov\u2019t Br. at 30. There is no apparent reason for this \ndistinction, and again the Government ignores the key \ncomparison to Section 3565(a). Regardless, this is yet \nanother provision in Section 3583 that does not use the \nword \u201conly,\u201d yet Congress\u2019s meaning is apparent.\nb.\u2003 The Government claims that petitioners\u2019 approach \ncreates an \u201canomaly\u201d with Section 3583(g) that its \napproach does not. Gov\u2019t Br. at 25-26. Not so. First, the \nbetter reading of 3583(g) is that it sets forth situations \nwhere revocation under Section 3583(e)(3) is mandatory, \nnot that it is wholly separate from (e)(3). Section 3583(e) \nincludes not only what factors to consider in revocation \nproceedings, but also what procedures to use and what \nburden of proof to apply. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(e)(3). Section \n3583(g) does not contain any of this. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(g). \nIf Section 3583(g) were seen as an independent revocation \nprovision, separate from Section 3583(e), it would lack \nprocedures to implement it and a burden of proof, and \nit would be the only sentence in the SRA (along with the \nequivalent probation provision, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03565(b)) for \n\n7\nwhich Congress did not specify what sentencing factors \nto apply. Cf. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03562(a) (specifying factors to \napply when imposing probation); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0 3565(a) \n(modifying or revoking probation); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03572(a) \n(imposing fine); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03582(a) (imposing prison); 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(c) (imposing supervised release); 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a03583(e) (modifying or revoking supervised release). \nUnderstanding Section 3583(g) as specifying situations \nwhere revocation under Section 3583(e) is mandatory, \nthere is no anomaly.\nEven if the Government were correct, though, its \napproach would not avoid the anomaly that it says exists. \nThe Government claims that it would be \u201cinexplicable\u201d for \nCongress to preclude considering Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s \nretribution factors in Section 3583(e)(3) revocations but \nnot in Section 3583(g) revocations. Gov\u2019t Br. at 26. But it \nis just as inexplicable that Congress would merely permit \nconsidering Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution factors \nin Section 3583(e) revocations but make those factors \nmandatory in Section 3583(g) revocations.\nSection 3583(g) reflects Congress\u2019s judgment that \ncertain violations require court intervention via revocation, \nthough perhaps for as short as one day in custody before \nreturning to supervised release. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(g). \nIt does not alter what Congress instructed when it chose \nto omit Section 3553(a)(2)(A) from Section 3583(e)\u2019s list \nof factors to consider when terminating, modifying, or \nrevoking supervised release.\nc.\u2003\nThe Government\u2019s approach would create \nadditional interpretive problems. The Government \nsuggests that the Court could interpret Section 3583(c) \n\n8\nand (e) to mean different things, repeatedly noting that the \ntwo subsections have \u201cdifferent wording (\u2018shall consider\u2019 \nversus \u2018after considering\u2019).\u201d Gov\u2019t Br. at 42, 44. But the two \nprovisions use the same listed factors: \u201cthe factors set forth \nin section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), \n(a)(6), and (a)(7),\u201d omitting Section 3553(a)(2)(A). 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a7\u00a03583(c), (e). Thus, the Government\u2019s interpretation \nwould create a difference between Sections 3583(c) and (e), \neven though those provisions use the same listed factors, \nin addition to erasing the textual difference between \nSections 3565(a) and 3583(e), even though those provisions \nuse different listed factors. See supra Section I.\nThe Government\u2019s claimed difference between \nSections 3583(c) and (e) would create an additional \nproblem: although a court could not impose supervised \nrelease based on Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution \nfactors, it could extend the term based on those factors \neven if nothing else changed. Note that, unlike before \nrevoking supervised release, Section 3583(e)(2) does not \nrequire a triggering event before a court extends a term \nof supervised release\u2014it requires only that the court \nconsider the listed factors. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(e)(2). \nThus, if Section 3583(c) precluded considering the Section \n3553(a)(2)(A) factors but Section 3583(e) permitted it, a \ncourt could rely on only the listed factors when imposing \nsupervised release and determining the length of the \nterm, then at any time later extend the term based on \nthe court\u2019s view that the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors \nwarranted an extended term as punishment that the court \ninitially could not consider.\nThe better view is that Sections 3583(c) and (e) both \npreclude considering Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution \nfactors, because the two subsections list the same factors \n\n9\nto consider and omit the same factors to preclude. See \nPet. Br. at 17-19, 20-22. In the context of Section 3583, the \ndifference between \u201cshall consider\u201d in Section 3583(c) and \n\u201cafter considering\u201d in Section 3583(e) is what the listed \nfactors apply to, not the substance. Congress used \u201cafter \nconsidering\u201d to apply the listed factors to the different \npossible court actions that follow in Section 3583(e), the \nsame as if it instead had listed the factors in each of the \nfour subsections. Cf. Pulsifer v. United States, 601 U.S. \n124, 137 (2024) (\u201cCongress, we recognize, just opted to \ndraft more concisely.\u201d).\nUnderstanding the identical lists in Sections 3583(c) \nand (e) to have the same meaning reveals additional \nproblems with the Government\u2019s approach. First, just as \nSections 3565(a) and 3583(e) use identical language except \nfor different listed factors governing revoking probation \nand revoking supervised release, so do Sections 3562(a) \nand 3583(c) use identical language except for different \nlisted factors governing imposing probation and imposing \nsupervised release. Compare 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03562(a) (\u201cshall \nconsider the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the \nextent that they are applicable\u201d), with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(c) \n(\u201cshall consider the factors set forth in section 3553(a)(1), \n(a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7)\u201d). \nThus, just as the Government\u2019s interpretation would \nerase the textual differences between Sections 3565(a) \nand 3583(e), see supra Section I, so too would it erase the \ntextual differences between Sections 3562(a) and 3583(c).\nSecond, because their identical lists of factors carry \nthe same meaning, the history behind Section 3583(c) is \nequally informative in interpreting Section 3583(e). The \nGovernment argues that those authorities do not matter \n\n10\nbecause, in its view, revocation under Section 3583(e) is \ndifferent from imposition under Section 3583(c). See Gov\u2019t \nBr. at 19, 40. Recognizing that the lists in Sections 3583(c) \nand (e) have the same meaning, though, that argument \ncollapses.\nIII.\tThe Government\u2019s approach is inconsistent with \nthe history of the Sentencing Reform Act.\nThe SRA\u2019s history further bolsters petitioners\u2019 \nposition. Congress created supervised release to encourage \nrehabilitation and supervise an offender\u2019s transition back \ninto society, following a prison term that previously \nfulfilled the need for retributive punishment. It thus \nprecluded courts from considering Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s \nretribution factors when imposing supervised release \nand when terminating or modifying supervised release, \nby using the same listed factors in the statutory \nprovision governing each. Importantly, Congress created \nsupervised release to be different from probation, which \ncould be imposed as a complete sentence on its own and \nfor which Congress included Section 3553(a)(2)(A) in the \nlist of factors to consider. Congress made a deliberate \nchoice to use different text in the statutes governing \nprobation and governing supervised release, and those \ntextual differences reflected Congress\u2019s different goals. \nSee Pet. Br. at 24-28.\nThe Government contorts the SRA\u2019s history to claim \nthat it supports a different view. It asserts that the \nSenate Report\u2019s discussion of Section 3583(c) \u201cis wholly \nconsistent with the potential for permissive consideration \nof other factors.\u201d Gov\u2019t Br. at 39. But it ignores the clearest \nstatement on the issue: \u201cThe term of supervised release \n\n11\nis very similar to a term of probation, except that it \nfollows a term of imprisonment and may not be imposed \nfor purposes of punishment or incapacitation since those \npurposes will have been served to the extent necessary \nby the term of imprisonment.\u201d S. Rep. No. 98-225, at 125 \n(1983) (emphasis added). The Government shifts to claim \nthat the Report\u2019s discussion of Section 3583(c) provides \n\u201clittle insight\u201d into the interpretation of Section 3583(e). \nGov\u2019t Br. at 40. But the identical lists of factors in Sections \n3583(c) and (e) have the same meaning, see supra Section \nII.c, as the Senate Report expressly states, see S. Rep. \nNo. 98-225, at 124 (noting that Section 3583(e) directs \nthe court to \u201cconsider[] the same factors considered in \nthe original imposition of a term of supervised release\u201d).\nThe Government says that the Court should ignore \nthe original SRA and look instead to the intent of the 1986 \nCongress, which added Section 3583(e)(3)\u2019s revocation \nprovision. See Gov\u2019t Br. at 19. But the 1986 Congress \nnested the new revocation provision under the previously \nenacted Section 3583(e), without altering Section 3583(e)\u2019s \nlist of factors to consider. The Government offers nothing, \ntextual or otherwise, to suggest that the 1986 amendment \naltered the meaning of the unaltered lists of factors in \nSections 3583(c) and (e) as enacted \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n28: 20240513103349823_Appendix.json (score: 0.363)\nAPPENDIX \n \n \n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nAPPENDIX A: United States v.

Esteras \nPage 2 \n \n____________________ \nAMENDED ORDER \n____________________ \n \nSUTTON, Chief Judge.  Edgardo Esteras appeals the district court\u2019s order revoking his \nsupervised release and sentencing him to 24 months in prison.  We affirm the district court\u2019s \nrevocation order for the reasons that follow. \n \nIn 2018, Esteras pleaded guilty to conspiring to distribute and possess with intent to \ndistribute heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846.  Varying downward from a \nguidelines range of 15 to 21 months, the district court sentenced Esteras to 12 months of \nimprisonment, to be served consecutively with a 15-month prison term for violating his \nprobation for a prior federal drug-trafficking conviction, followed by six years of supervised \nrelease.  \n \nEsteras\u2019s six-year term of supervised release began in January 2020.  Three years later, in \nJanuary 2023, the probation officer reported to the district court that Esteras had violated the \nconditions of his supervised release (1) by committing domestic violence, aggravated menacing, \nand criminal damaging, and (2) by possessing a firearm.  The probation officer notified the \ndistrict court that the new criminal charges against Esteras had been dismissed at the victim\u2019s \nrequest.   \nJudge Benita Y. Pearson conducted a hearing and found that Esteras possessed a firearm \nwhile under supervised release.  She \u201cworr[ied]\u201d that her previous sentences for drug crimes and \nviolating an earlier supervised release term failed \u201cto deter [Esteras], to encourage [him] to be \nrespectful of the law.\u201d  R.439 at 83.  Based on his \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cdisrespectful\u201d behavior, she \nvaried upward from an advisory range of six to twelve months to impose a 24-month jail \nsentence, \u201clong enough to at least allow [Esteras] to reconsider [his] behavior.\u201d  Id. at 85.  She \nadded three years of supervised release to the sentence, including an anger management class \nand six months of location monitoring.  These conditions, Judge Pearson explained, would teach \nhim to \u201cdo better\u201d and \u201cthink before [he] act[s].\u201d  Id. \nAppendix B\n5a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 3 \n \n \nEsteras objected that the court should not have considered the three subfactors identified \nin 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) when crafting its sentence:  \u201cto reflect the seriousness of the \noffense, to promote respect for the law, and provide just punishment for the offense.\u201d  Id. at 92.  \nJudge Pearson agreed that \u201cpart of [her] contemplation certainly is the need for the sentence \nimposed, to promote respect for the law.\u201d  Id.  But she added that she also considered deterrence \nand community safety, which appear in other statutory provisions.  She also referenced her \ndecision to vary upward \u201cto separate Mr. Esteras from the average, typical, mine run-type \ndefendant.\u201d  Id.  \n \nIn closing the hearing, Judge Pearson expressed hope that Esteras would take advantage \nof this opportunity.  She acknowledged that some of the conventional features of supervised \nrelease could be seen as partly \u201cpunitive,\u201d such as location monitoring and other measures that \n\u201crestrict [his] freedom\u201d of movement.  Id.  She then referred to other terms, such as anger \nmanagement, as \u201cthere to bolster [him]\u201d and \u201chelp [him] to do better going forward.\u201d  Id. at 95\u2013\n96.  \n \nOn appeal, Esteras challenges his sentence on the ground that the district court relied on \nprohibited factors in sentencing him.  We disagree. \nCongress has authorized district courts to revoke supervised release.  See 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 3583(e).  In some settings, district courts have discretion to revoke, modify, or decrease a term \nof supervised release.  Id.  In other settings, as when a parolee possesses a weapon as Esteras did \nhere, the district court must revoke the individual\u2019s supervised release.  Id. \u00a7 3583(g).  Whether \nat the outset of sentencing an individual, in the context of a modified term of supervised release, \nor in the context of a required revocation of supervised release, Congress has directed courts to \nconsider certain factors.  In the words of Congress under the heading \u201cFactors to be considered \nin including a term of supervised release\u201d:  \u201cThe court . . . consider[s] the factors set forth in \nsection 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7).\u201d  Id. \n\u00a7 3583(c); see also id. \u00a7 3583(e) (similar for \u201cmodification of conditions or revocation\u201d of \nsupervised release).   \nAppendix B\n6a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 4 \n \nTo bring this provision into full view, here is a full recitation of \u00a7 3553(a) that italicizes \nthe factors that district courts need not consider in supervised-release determinations: \nThe court shall impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply \nwith the purposes set forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection. The court, in determining \nthe particular sentence to be imposed, shall consider\u2014 \n(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics \nof the defendant; \n(2) the need for the sentence imposed\u2014 \n(A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, \nand to provide just punishment for the offense; \n(B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; \n(C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and \n(D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational \ntraining, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective \nmanner; \n(3) the kinds of sentences available; \n(4) the kinds of sentence and the sentencing range established for\u2014 \n(A) the applicable category of offense committed by the applicable \ncategory of defendant as set forth in the guidelines\u2014 \n(i) issued by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to section \n994(a)(1) of title 28, United States Code, subject to any \namendments \nmade \nto \nsuch \nguidelines \nby \nact \nof Congress (regardless of whether such amendments have yet to \nbe incorporated by the Sentencing Commission into amendments \nissued under section 994(p) of title 28); and \n(ii) that, except as provided in section 3742(g), are in effect on the \ndate the defendant is sentenced; or \n(B) in the case of a violation of probation or supervised release, the \napplicable guidelines or policy statements issued by the Sentencing \nCommission pursuant to section 994(a)(3) of title 28, United States Code, \ntaking into account any amendments made to such guidelines or policy \nstatements by act of Congress (regardless of whether such amendments \nhave yet to be incorporated by the Sentencing Commission into \namendments issued under section 994(p) of title 28); \n(5) any pertinent policy statement\u2014 \n(A) issued by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to section 994(a)(2) of \ntitle 28, United States Code, subject to any amendments made to such \nAppendix B\n7a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 5 \n \npolicy statement by act of Congress (regardless of whether such \namendments have yet to be incorporated by the Sentencing Commission \ninto amendments issued under section 994(p) of title 28); and \n(B) that, except as provided in section 3742(g), is in effect on the date the \ndefendant is sentenced.  \n(6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with \nsimilar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct; and \n(7) the need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense. \n \nInvoking the italicized language, Esteras claims that \u00a7 3583(c) and (e) create a divide \nbetween permitted and forbidden supervised-release considerations.  As he sees it, a district court \njudge who considers the forbidden factors\u2014\u201cthe seriousness of the offense,\u201d \u201crespect for the \nlaw,\u201d \u201cjust punishment for the offense,\u201d or \u201cthe kinds of sentences available\u201d\u2014necessarily \nimposes a procedurally unreasonable sentence.  Notably, this argument applies to original \nsupervised-release decisions, which come immediately on the heels of any prison-sentence \ndetermination under all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(c), as well as to any \nrevocation, modification, or reduction determinations with respect to supervised release, see id. \n\u00a7 3583(e), (g). \nUnited States v. Lewis rejected this argument.  498 F.3d 393, 399\u2013400 (6th Cir. 2007).  It \nprovided two explanations:  one textual, one contextual.  Textually, Lewis observes that \u00a7 3583 \ngenerally gives courts considerable discretion over supervised-release decisions after considering \nthe listed factors.  Id. at 400.  It never says that the court may consider \u201conly\u201d those factors.  Id.  \nCongress, as it happens, knew how to instruct courts not to consider certain sentencing factors, as \nshown in its express command to disregard the goal of rehabilitation when imposing prison time.  \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(a) (\u201crecognizing that imprisonment is not an appropriate means of promoting \ncorrection or rehabilitation\u201d).   \nIn the context of supervised-release decisions, moreover, Lewis was concerned that this \nproposed bright-line rule was unworkable.  Whether in the context of an initial or later \nsupervised-release \ndecision, \nthe \npurportedly \nforbidden \nconsiderations \nmentioned \nin \n\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) tend to be \u201cessentially redundant\u201d with the permitted ones.  Lewis, 498 F.3d at \n400.  Take \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s consideration about the \u201cseriousness of the offense.\u201d  It aligns with \nAppendix B\n8a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 6 \n \n\u00a7 3553(a)(1) and its emphasis on \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense.\u201d  To think about \nthe one requires the judge to think about the other.   \nOr take \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s consideration of the need \u201cto promote respect for the law.\u201d  It \nmeshes with the rationale that revoking supervised release will \u201chelp\u201d the defendant \u201clearn to \nobey the conditions of his supervised release.\u201d  Id. (quoting Johnson v. United States, 529 U.S. \n694, 709 (2000)).  Indeed, in this case, Judge Pearson quite understandably could not see how \nshe could ignore respect for the law but consider a defendant\u2019s need to respect the terms of \nsupervised release.  To neglect the one dishonors the other. \nOr take \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s reference to \u201cjust punishment for the offense.\u201d  Under \n\u00a7 3553(a)(5), courts must consider \u201cany pertinent policy statement\u201d of the Sentencing \nCommission.  Among other guidance, the Commission tells judges to \u201csanction the violator for \nfailing to abide by the conditions of the court-ordered supervision.\u201d  Id. (quoting U.S.S.G. ch. 7 \npt. A \u00a7 3(b)).  The district court, in other words, must craft a remedy that corresponds to how \nseverely the defendant has breached the court\u2019s trust as \u201cembodied by the original sentence,\u201d \nwhich it cannot do without accounting for the conduct that violated supervised release.  United \nStates v. Johnson, 640 F.3d 195, 204 (6th Cir. 2011).  Another enumerated factor tells a court \nhow to carry out that analysis.  Under \u00a7 3553(a)(4)(B)\u2019s command to consult the Sentencing \nCommission\u2019s supervised-release guidelines, a court first classifies how \u201cserious\u201d these \nviolations are and then uses the categorization to determine the length of any prison sentence.  \nU.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 7B1.1, 7B1.3, 7B1.4. \nEsteras\u2019s bright-line rule is unworkable in another way.  Recall that Congress requires \ncourts to consider the same set of factors when first imposing a term of supervised release as \nwhen revoking one.  18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(c), (e).  Under Esteras\u2019s rule, if Congress forbade district \ncourts from considering anything related to \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) at a revocation hearing, it would not \npermit use of anything related to those factors at an initial sentencing either.  How would this \nwork?  Would the sentencing judge have to adjourn the hearing after imposing a sentence?  \nThen, would she have to start over with a new unblemished inquiry into the right term of \nsupervised release without any consideration, explicitly or implicitly, of considerations related \nto, say, the \u201crule of law\u201d?  Congress could not have expected courts to wipe their minds of these \nAppendix B\n9a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 7 \n \nconcerns when they move from one type of sentence to the other, and nothing in the statute \nrequires such compartmentalization.  If anything, the language points the other way.  It \nspecifically allows courts to account for the length of a supervised-release term \u201cin imposing a \nsentence to a term of imprisonment.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 3583(a).  \nEsteras\u2019s invocation of Tapia v. United States does not change matters.  564 U.S. 319 \n(2011).  It did not, most critically, arise under this statute.  The case dealt with a different \nsentencing law, one with explicit directions, not uncertain implications.  The statute in no \nuncertain \nterms \nsays \n\u201cthat \nimprisonment \nis \nnot \nan \nappropriate \nmeans \nof \npromoting . . . rehabilitation.\u201d  18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(a).  Consistent with that directive, Tapia ruled \nthat the statute precludes courts from considering \u201crehabilitation\u201d when imposing prison time.  \n\u201cOur consideration of Tapia\u2019s claim,\u201d it reasoned, \u201cstarts with the text of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(a)\u2014\nand given the clarity of that provision\u2019s language, could end there as well.\u201d  Tapia, 564 U.S. at \n326. \nIn the course of its analysis, it is true, the Court said in dicta that \u201ca court may not take \naccount of retribution\u201d when it \u201cimpos[es] a term of supervised release.\u201d  Id.  But even taken at \nface value, this reference does not undermine the district court\u2019s sentence.  The provision \nconfirms two things.  First, when the court imposes an initial supervised-release term, retribution \nshould not guide the decision.  No one has shown that Judge Pearson did anything of the sort at \nthat point\u2014and Esteras has not argued otherwise.  Second, if the defendant violates a term of \nsupervised release or commits a new crime, the government is put to a choice.  If it wishes to \nexact retribution for the new offense, new charges and the resulting process that comes with it \nare in order.  Otherwise, the district court should focus on non-retributive factors in deciding the \nnew sentence and the new term of supervised release.  But the district court in this instance did \nnot claim a right to exact retribution for this violation or for that matter use the word.  As shown, \nreferences to other concepts mentioned in \u00a7 3553(a)(2) are hopelessly over-inclusive, and mere \nreferences to things like the \u201crule of law\u201d\u2014or, worse, concepts that overlap with it\u2014do not \ncreate a procedurally unreasonable sentence absent evidence that the court was engaged in \nimposing a purely retributive sentence.  No such evidence exists here.  In fact, Tapia confirms \nthe point.  It ruled for the defendant only after observing that the court\u2019s \u201cnumber one thing \nAppendix B\n10a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 8 \n \n[was] the need to provide treatment\u201d and so may have increased the sentence to ensure Tapia \nwas \u201cin long enough to get the 500 Hour Drug Program.\u201d  Id. at 334 (quotations omitted).  \nThis understanding of \u00a7 3583(e) accords with the analysis of most other circuits and the \noutcomes of all of them.  The general rule is that courts may invoke factors related to the three \ngeneral considerations in \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) without creating a procedurally unreasonable sentence.  \nUnited States v. Vargas-Davila, 649 F.3d 129, 132 (1st Cir. 2011) (\u201cAlthough section 3583(e)(3) \nincorporates by reference, and thus encourages, consideration of certain enumerated subsections \nof section 3553(a), it does not forbid consideration of other pertinent section 3553(a) factors.\u201d); \nUnited States v. Williams, 443 F.3d 35, 48 (2d Cir. 2006) (\u201c[Section] 3583(e) cannot reasonably \nbe interpreted to exclude consideration of the seriousness of the releasee\u2019s violation, given the \nother factors that must be considered.\u201d); United States v. Young, 634 F.3d 233, 240 (3d Cir. \n2011) (\u201c[T]he mere omission of \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) from the mandatory supervised release \nrevocation considerations in \u00a7 3583(e) does not preclude a court from taking [the \n\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors] into account.  To hold otherwise would ignore the reality that the \nviolator\u2019s conduct simply cannot be disregarded in determining the appropriate sanction.\u201d); \nUnited States v. Webb, 738 F.3d 638, 642 (4th Cir. 2013) (\u201c[A]lthough a district court may not \nimpose a revocation sentence based predominantly on [the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors], we conclude \nthat mere reference to such considerations does not render a revocation sentence procedurally \nunreasonable when those factors are relevant to, and considered in conjunction with, the \nenumerated \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d); United States v. Clay, 752 F.3d 1106, 1108\u201309 (7th Cir. 2014) \n(\u201c[T]his subsection may be considered so long as the district court relies primarily on the factors \nlisted in \u00a7 3583(e) . . . .  [T]here is significant overlap between these factors and \n\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A).\u201d); see also United States v. King, 57 F.4th 1334, 1338 n.1 (11th Cir. 2023) \n(acknowledging language in prior cases permitting references to factors that also appear in \n\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)). \nEsteras\u2019s argument, notably, does not even work on its own terms\u2014at least the terms of \nthose circuits that support some of his reasoning.  The circuits that have described the \n\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors as impermissible when used punitively still recognize that they may play \nsupporting roles in a district court\u2019s analysis.  United States v. Sanchez, 900 F.3d 678, 684 n.5 \nAppendix B\n11a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 9 \n \n(5th Cir. 2018) (\u201c[T]his is not to say that any use of words like \u2018punish,\u2019 \u2018serious,\u2019 or \u2018respect\u2019 \nautomatically renders a revocation sentence void.  Mere mention of impermissible factors is \nacceptable; to constitute reversible error, our circuit has said, the forbidden factor must be \n\u2018dominant.\u2019\u201d); United States v. Porter, 974 F.3d 905, 907 (8th Cir. 2020) (\u201cAlthough we have \nlabeled \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) an improper, irrelevant, or \u2018excluded\u2019 factor, we have not declared its \nconsideration an error of law and therefore an abuse of discretion.\u201d); United States v. Simtob, \n485 F.3d 1058, 1063 (9th Cir. 2007) (\u201c[A] district court may properly look to and consider the \nconduct underlying the revocation as one of many acts contributing to the severity of the \nviolator\u2019s breach of trust so as not to preclude a full review of the violator\u2019s history and the \nviolator\u2019s likelihood of repeating that history.\u201d); United States v. Booker, 63 F.4th 1254, 1261\u2013\n62 (10th Cir. 2023) (rejecting the criminal defendant\u2019s appeal in a plain-error setting and noting \nthat it would be problematic to rely on a \u201cdirect quotation to [two] factors that may not be \nconsidered\u201d and as a result issue a \u201cretributive\u201d sentence).  Even under these decisions, Judge \nPearson acted properly when she considered the need to promote respect for \u201cthe rule of law\u201d \nalongside the enumerated \u00a7 3553(a) factors.  This \u201chighly relevant\u201d concern clearly speaks to the \nneed to deter Esteras\u2019s misconduct and protect the public from his disregard of the rule of law, to \nsay nothing of fulfilling the Sentencing Guideline\u2019s commentary on sanctioning Esteras for \nbreaching the court\u2019s trust.  Porter, 974 F.3d at 908\u201309.  All in all, it is highly doubtful that the \noutcome in this case would change under any other circuit\u2019s decision.   \nLast of all, Esteras is concerned that Judge Pearson us\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n30: 20240513103349823_Appendix_proc1_5.json (score: 0.363)\nAPPENDIX \n \n \n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nAPPENDIX A: United States v.

Esteras \nPage 2 \n \n____________________ \nAMENDED ORDER \n____________________ \n \nSUTTON, Chief Judge.  Edgardo Esteras appeals the district court\u2019s order revoking his \nsupervised release and sentencing him to 24 months in prison.  We affirm the district court\u2019s \nrevocation order for the reasons that follow. \n \nIn 2018, Esteras pleaded guilty to conspiring to distribute and possess with intent to \ndistribute heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846.  Varying downward from a \nguidelines range of 15 to 21 months, the district court sentenced Esteras to 12 months of \nimprisonment, to be served consecutively with a 15-month prison term for violating his \nprobation for a prior federal drug-trafficking conviction, followed by six years of supervised \nrelease.  \n \nEsteras\u2019s six-year term of supervised release began in January 2020.  Three years later, in \nJanuary 2023, the probation officer reported to the district court that Esteras had violated the \nconditions of his supervised release (1) by committing domestic violence, aggravated menacing, \nand criminal damaging, and (2) by possessing a firearm.  The probation officer notified the \ndistrict court that the new criminal charges against Esteras had been dismissed at the victim\u2019s \nrequest.   \nJudge Benita Y. Pearson conducted a hearing and found that Esteras possessed a firearm \nwhile under supervised release.  She \u201cworr[ied]\u201d that her previous sentences for drug crimes and \nviolating an earlier supervised release term failed \u201cto deter [Esteras], to encourage [him] to be \nrespectful of the law.\u201d  R.439 at 83.  Based on his \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cdisrespectful\u201d behavior, she \nvaried upward from an advisory range of six to twelve months to impose a 24-month jail \nsentence, \u201clong enough to at least allow [Esteras] to reconsider [his] behavior.\u201d  Id. at 85.  She \nadded three years of supervised release to the sentence, including an anger management class \nand six months of location monitoring.  These conditions, Judge Pearson explained, would teach \nhim to \u201cdo better\u201d and \u201cthink before [he] act[s].\u201d  Id. \nAppendix B\n5a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 3 \n \n \nEsteras objected that the court should not have considered the three subfactors identified \nin 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) when crafting its sentence:  \u201cto reflect the seriousness of the \noffense, to promote respect for the law, and provide just punishment for the offense.\u201d  Id. at 92.  \nJudge Pearson agreed that \u201cpart of [her] contemplation certainly is the need for the sentence \nimposed, to promote respect for the law.\u201d  Id.  But she added that she also considered deterrence \nand community safety, which appear in other statutory provisions.  She also referenced her \ndecision to vary upward \u201cto separate Mr. Esteras from the average, typical, mine run-type \ndefendant.\u201d  Id.  \n \nIn closing the hearing, Judge Pearson expressed hope that Esteras would take advantage \nof this opportunity.  She acknowledged that some of the conventional features of supervised \nrelease could be seen as partly \u201cpunitive,\u201d such as location monitoring and other measures that \n\u201crestrict [his] freedom\u201d of movement.  Id.  She then referred to other terms, such as anger \nmanagement, as \u201cthere to bolster [him]\u201d and \u201chelp [him] to do better going forward.\u201d  Id. at 95\u2013\n96.  \n \nOn appeal, Esteras challenges his sentence on the ground that the district court relied on \nprohibited factors in sentencing him.  We disagree. \nCongress has authorized district courts to revoke supervised release.  See 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 3583(e).  In some settings, district courts have discretion to revoke, modify, or decrease a term \nof supervised release.  Id.  In other settings, as when a parolee possesses a weapon as Esteras did \nhere, the district court must revoke the individual\u2019s supervised release.  Id. \u00a7 3583(g).  Whether \nat the outset of sentencing an individual, in the context of a modified term of supervised release, \nor in the context of a required revocation of supervised release, Congress has directed courts to \nconsider certain factors.  In the words of Congress under the heading \u201cFactors to be considered \nin including a term of supervised release\u201d:  \u201cThe court . . . consider[s] the factors set forth in \nsection 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7).\u201d  Id. \n\u00a7 3583(c); see also id. \u00a7 3583(e) (similar for \u201cmodification of conditions or revocation\u201d of \nsupervised release).   \nAppendix B\n6a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 4 \n \nTo bring this provision into full view, here is a full recitation of \u00a7 3553(a) that italicizes \nthe factors that district courts need not consider in supervised-release determinations: \nThe court shall impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply \nwith the purposes set forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection. The court, in determining \nthe particular sentence to be imposed, shall consider\u2014 \n(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics \nof the defendant; \n(2) the need for the sentence imposed\u2014 \n(A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, \nand to provide just punishment for the offense; \n(B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; \n(C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and \n(D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational \ntraining, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective \nmanner; \n(3) the kinds of sentences available; \n(4) the kinds of sentence and the sentencing range established for\u2014 \n(A) the applicable category of offense committed by the applicable \ncategory of defendant as set forth in the guidelines\u2014 \n(i) issued by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to section \n994(a)(1) of title 28, United States Code, subject to any \namendments \nmade \nto \nsuch \nguidelines \nby \nact \nof Congress (regardless of whether such amendments have yet to \nbe incorporated by the Sentencing Commission into amendments \nissued under section 994(p) of title 28); and \n(ii) that, except as provided in section 3742(g), are in effect on the \ndate the defendant is sentenced; or \n(B) in the case of a violation of probation or supervised release, the \napplicable guidelines or policy statements issued by the Sentencing \nCommission pursuant to section 994(a)(3) of title 28, United States Code, \ntaking into account any amendments made to such guidelines or policy \nstatements by act of Congress (regardless of whether such amendments \nhave yet to be incorporated by the Sentencing Commission into \namendments issued under section 994(p) of title 28); \n(5) any pertinent policy statement\u2014 \n(A) issued by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to section 994(a)(2) of \ntitle 28, United States Code, subject to any amendments made to such \nAppendix B\n7a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 5 \n \npolicy statement by act of Congress (regardless of whether such \namendments have yet to be incorporated by the Sentencing Commission \ninto amendments issued under section 994(p) of title 28); and \n(B) that, except as provided in section 3742(g), is in effect on the date the \ndefendant is sentenced.  \n(6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with \nsimilar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct; and \n(7) the need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense. \n \nInvoking the italicized language, Esteras claims that \u00a7 3583(c) and (e) create a divide \nbetween permitted and forbidden supervised-release considerations.  As he sees it, a district court \njudge who considers the forbidden factors\u2014\u201cthe seriousness of the offense,\u201d \u201crespect for the \nlaw,\u201d \u201cjust punishment for the offense,\u201d or \u201cthe kinds of sentences available\u201d\u2014necessarily \nimposes a procedurally unreasonable sentence.  Notably, this argument applies to original \nsupervised-release decisions, which come immediately on the heels of any prison-sentence \ndetermination under all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(c), as well as to any \nrevocation, modification, or reduction determinations with respect to supervised release, see id. \n\u00a7 3583(e), (g). \nUnited States v. Lewis rejected this argument.  498 F.3d 393, 399\u2013400 (6th Cir. 2007).  It \nprovided two explanations:  one textual, one contextual.  Textually, Lewis observes that \u00a7 3583 \ngenerally gives courts considerable discretion over supervised-release decisions after considering \nthe listed factors.  Id. at 400.  It never says that the court may consider \u201conly\u201d those factors.  Id.  \nCongress, as it happens, knew how to instruct courts not to consider certain sentencing factors, as \nshown in its express command to disregard the goal of rehabilitation when imposing prison time.  \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(a) (\u201crecognizing that imprisonment is not an appropriate means of promoting \ncorrection or rehabilitation\u201d).   \nIn the context of supervised-release decisions, moreover, Lewis was concerned that this \nproposed bright-line rule was unworkable.  Whether in the context of an initial or later \nsupervised-release \ndecision, \nthe \npurportedly \nforbidden \nconsiderations \nmentioned \nin \n\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) tend to be \u201cessentially redundant\u201d with the permitted ones.  Lewis, 498 F.3d at \n400.  Take \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s consideration about the \u201cseriousness of the offense.\u201d  It aligns with \nAppendix B\n8a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 6 \n \n\u00a7 3553(a)(1) and its emphasis on \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense.\u201d  To think about \nthe one requires the judge to think about the other.   \nOr take \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s consideration of the need \u201cto promote respect for the law.\u201d  It \nmeshes with the rationale that revoking supervised release will \u201chelp\u201d the defendant \u201clearn to \nobey the conditions of his supervised release.\u201d  Id. (quoting Johnson v. United States, 529 U.S. \n694, 709 (2000)).  Indeed, in this case, Judge Pearson quite understandably could not see how \nshe could ignore respect for the law but consider a defendant\u2019s need to respect the terms of \nsupervised release.  To neglect the one dishonors the other. \nOr take \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s reference to \u201cjust punishment for the offense.\u201d  Under \n\u00a7 3553(a)(5), courts must consider \u201cany pertinent policy statement\u201d of the Sentencing \nCommission.  Among other guidance, the Commission tells judges to \u201csanction the violator for \nfailing to abide by the conditions of the court-ordered supervision.\u201d  Id. (quoting U.S.S.G. ch. 7 \npt. A \u00a7 3(b)).  The district court, in other words, must craft a remedy that corresponds to how \nseverely the defendant has breached the court\u2019s trust as \u201cembodied by the original sentence,\u201d \nwhich it cannot do without accounting for the conduct that violated supervised release.  United \nStates v. Johnson, 640 F.3d 195, 204 (6th Cir. 2011).  Another enumerated factor tells a court \nhow to carry out that analysis.  Under \u00a7 3553(a)(4)(B)\u2019s command to consult the Sentencing \nCommission\u2019s supervised-release guidelines, a court first classifies how \u201cserious\u201d these \nviolations are and then uses the categorization to determine the length of any prison sentence.  \nU.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 7B1.1, 7B1.3, 7B1.4. \nEsteras\u2019s bright-line rule is unworkable in another way.  Recall that Congress requires \ncourts to consider the same set of factors when first imposing a term of supervised release as \nwhen revoking one.  18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(c), (e).  Under Esteras\u2019s rule, if Congress forbade district \ncourts from considering anything related to \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) at a revocation hearing, it would not \npermit use of anything related to those factors at an initial sentencing either.  How would this \nwork?  Would the sentencing judge have to adjourn the hearing after imposing a sentence?  \nThen, would she have to start over with a new unblemished inquiry into the right term of \nsupervised release without any consideration, explicitly or implicitly, of considerations related \nto, say, the \u201crule of law\u201d?  Congress could not have expected courts to wipe their minds of these \nAppendix B\n9a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 7 \n \nconcerns when they move from one type of sentence to the other, and nothing in the statute \nrequires such compartmentalization.  If anything, the language points the other way.  It \nspecifically allows courts to account for the length of a supervised-release term \u201cin imposing a \nsentence to a term of imprisonment.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 3583(a).  \nEsteras\u2019s invocation of Tapia v. United States does not change matters.  564 U.S. 319 \n(2011).  It did not, most critically, arise under this statute.  The case dealt with a different \nsentencing law, one with explicit directions, not uncertain implications.  The statute in no \nuncertain \nterms \nsays \n\u201cthat \nimprisonment \nis \nnot \nan \nappropriate \nmeans \nof \npromoting . . . rehabilitation.\u201d  18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(a).  Consistent with that directive, Tapia ruled \nthat the statute precludes courts from considering \u201crehabilitation\u201d when imposing prison time.  \n\u201cOur consideration of Tapia\u2019s claim,\u201d it reasoned, \u201cstarts with the text of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(a)\u2014\nand given the clarity of that provision\u2019s language, could end there as well.\u201d  Tapia, 564 U.S. at \n326. \nIn the course of its analysis, it is true, the Court said in dicta that \u201ca court may not take \naccount of retribution\u201d when it \u201cimpos[es] a term of supervised release.\u201d  Id.  But even taken at \nface value, this reference does not undermine the district court\u2019s sentence.  The provision \nconfirms two things.  First, when the court imposes an initial supervised-release term, retribution \nshould not guide the decision.  No one has shown that Judge Pearson did anything of the sort at \nthat point\u2014and Esteras has not argued otherwise.  Second, if the defendant violates a term of \nsupervised release or commits a new crime, the government is put to a choice.  If it wishes to \nexact retribution for the new offense, new charges and the resulting process that comes with it \nare in order.  Otherwise, the district court should focus on non-retributive factors in deciding the \nnew sentence and the new term of supervised release.  But the district court in this instance did \nnot claim a right to exact retribution for this violation or for that matter use the word.  As shown, \nreferences to other concepts mentioned in \u00a7 3553(a)(2) are hopelessly over-inclusive, and mere \nreferences to things like the \u201crule of law\u201d\u2014or, worse, concepts that overlap with it\u2014do not \ncreate a procedurally unreasonable sentence absent evidence that the court was engaged in \nimposing a purely retributive sentence.  No such evidence exists here.  In fact, Tapia confirms \nthe point.  It ruled for the defendant only after observing that the court\u2019s \u201cnumber one thing \nAppendix B\n10a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 8 \n \n[was] the need to provide treatment\u201d and so may have increased the sentence to ensure Tapia \nwas \u201cin long enough to get the 500 Hour Drug Program.\u201d  Id. at 334 (quotations omitted).  \nThis understanding of \u00a7 3583(e) accords with the analysis of most other circuits and the \noutcomes of all of them.  The general rule is that courts may invoke factors related to the three \ngeneral considerations in \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) without creating a procedurally unreasonable sentence.  \nUnited States v. Vargas-Davila, 649 F.3d 129, 132 (1st Cir. 2011) (\u201cAlthough section 3583(e)(3) \nincorporates by reference, and thus encourages, consideration of certain enumerated subsections \nof section 3553(a), it does not forbid consideration of other pertinent section 3553(a) factors.\u201d); \nUnited States v. Williams, 443 F.3d 35, 48 (2d Cir. 2006) (\u201c[Section] 3583(e) cannot reasonably \nbe interpreted to exclude consideration of the seriousness of the releasee\u2019s violation, given the \nother factors that must be considered.\u201d); United States v. Young, 634 F.3d 233, 240 (3d Cir. \n2011) (\u201c[T]he mere omission of \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) from the mandatory supervised release \nrevocation considerations in \u00a7 3583(e) does not preclude a court from taking [the \n\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors] into account.  To hold otherwise would ignore the reality that the \nviolator\u2019s conduct simply cannot be disregarded in determining the appropriate sanction.\u201d); \nUnited States v. Webb, 738 F.3d 638, 642 (4th Cir. 2013) (\u201c[A]lthough a district court may not \nimpose a revocation sentence based predominantly on [the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors], we conclude \nthat mere reference to such considerations does not render a revocation sentence procedurally \nunreasonable when those factors are relevant to, and considered in conjunction with, the \nenumerated \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d); United States v. Clay, 752 F.3d 1106, 1108\u201309 (7th Cir. 2014) \n(\u201c[T]his subsection may be considered so long as the district court relies primarily on the factors \nlisted in \u00a7 3583(e) . . . .  [T]here is significant overlap between these factors and \n\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A).\u201d); see also United States v. King, 57 F.4th 1334, 1338 n.1 (11th Cir. 2023) \n(acknowledging language in prior cases permitting references to factors that also appear in \n\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)). \nEsteras\u2019s argument, notably, does not even work on its own terms\u2014at least the terms of \nthose circuits that support some of his reasoning.  The circuits that have described the \n\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors as impermissible when used punitively still recognize that they may play \nsupporting roles in a district court\u2019s analysis.  United States v. Sanchez, 900 F.3d 678, 684 n.5 \nAppendix B\n11a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 9 \n \n(5th Cir. 2018) (\u201c[T]his is not to say that any use of words like \u2018punish,\u2019 \u2018serious,\u2019 or \u2018respect\u2019 \nautomatically renders a revocation sentence void.  Mere mention of impermissible factors is \nacceptable; to constitute reversible error, our circuit has said, the forbidden factor must be \n\u2018dominant.\u2019\u201d); United States v. Porter, 974 F.3d 905, 907 (8th Cir. 2020) (\u201cAlthough we have \nlabeled \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) an improper, irrelevant, or \u2018excluded\u2019 factor, we have not declared its \nconsideration an error of law and therefore an abuse of discretion.\u201d); United States v. Simtob, \n485 F.3d 1058, 1063 (9th Cir. 2007) (\u201c[A] district court may properly look to and consider the \nconduct underlying the revocation as one of many acts contributing to the severity of the \nviolator\u2019s breach of trust so as not to preclude a full review of the violator\u2019s history and the \nviolator\u2019s likelihood of repeating that history.\u201d); United States v. Booker, 63 F.4th 1254, 1261\u2013\n62 (10th Cir. 2023) (rejecting the criminal defendant\u2019s appeal in a plain-error setting and noting \nthat it would be problematic to rely on a \u201cdirect quotation to [two] factors that may not be \nconsidered\u201d and as a result issue a \u201cretributive\u201d sentence).  Even under these decisions, Judge \nPearson acted properly when she considered the need to promote respect for \u201cthe rule of law\u201d \nalongside the enumerated \u00a7 3553(a) factors.  This \u201chighly relevant\u201d concern clearly speaks to the \nneed to deter Esteras\u2019s misconduct and protect the public from his disregard of the rule of law, to \nsay nothing of fulfilling the Sentencing Guideline\u2019s commentary on sanctioning Esteras for \nbreaching the court\u2019s trust.  Porter, 974 F.3d at 908\u201309.  All in all, it is highly doubtful that the \noutcome in this case would change under any other circuit\u2019s decision.   \nLast of all, Esteras is concerned that Judge Pearson us\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n12: 20241210070551859_No.2023-7483_Brief20for20the20Petitioners.json (score: 0.363)\nNo. 23-7483\nIn the\nSupreme Court of the United States\nOn Writ of Certiorari to the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit\nA\n(800) 274-3321 \u2022 (800) 359-6859\nBRIEF FOR THE PETITIONERS\n130631\nEDGARDO ESTERAS, \nTIMOTHY MICHAEL JAIMEZ FKA TIMOTHY M. \nWATTERS, AND TORIANO A.

This \nCourt\u2019s jurisdiction rests on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01254(1).\nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED\nSection 3583(e) of Title 18, United States Code, \nprovides:\nModification of Conditions or Revocation.\u2014\nThe court may, after considering the factors set \nforth in section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)\n(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7)\u2014\n(1)\u2003 terminate a term of supervised release \nand discharge the defendant released at \nany time after the expiration of one year of \nsupervised release, pursuant to the provisions \nof the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure \nrelating to the modification of probation, if it \nis satisfied that such action is warranted by \nthe conduct of the defendant released and the \ninterest of justice;\n(2)\u2003 extend a term of supervised release if \nless than the maximum authorized term was \npreviously imposed, and may modify, reduce, \nor enlarge the conditions of supervised \nrelease, at any time prior to the expiration or \ntermination of the term of supervised release, \npursuant to the provisions of the Federal \n\n3\nRules of Criminal Procedure relating to the \nmodification of probation and the provisions \napplicable to the initial setting of the terms \nand conditions of post-release supervision;\n(3)\u2003 revoke a term of supervised release, \nand require the defendant to serve in prison \nall or part of the term of supervised release \nauthorized by statute for the offense that \nresulted in such term of supervised release \nwithout credit for time previously served on \npost\u00adrelease supervision, if the court, pursuant \nto the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure \napplicable to revocation of probation or \nsupervised release, finds by a preponderance \nof the evidence that the defendant violated a \ncondition of supervised release, except that \na defendant whose term is revoked under \nthis paragraph may not be required to serve \non any such revocation more than 5 years in \nprison if the offense that resulted in the term \nof supervised release is a class A felony, more \nthan 3 years in prison if such offense is a class \nB felony, more than 2 years in prison if such \noffense is a class C or D felony, or more than \none year in any other case; or\n(4)\u2003\norder the defendant to remain at \nhis place of residence during nonworking \nhours and, if the court so directs, to have \ncompliance monitored by telephone or \nelectronic signaling devices, except that an \norder under this paragraph may be imposed \nonly as an alternative to incarceration.\n\n4\nSection 3553(a) of Title 18, U.S. Code, provides:\nFactors To Be Considered in Imposing a \nSentence.\u2014The court shall impose a sentence \nsufficient, but not greater than necessary, \nto comply with the purposes set forth in \nparagraph (2) of this subsection. The court, \nin determining the particular sentence to be \nimposed, shall consider\u2014\n(1)\u2003 the nature and circumstances of the \noffense and the history and characteristics \nof the defendant;\n(2)\u2003 the need for the sentence imposed\u2014\n(A)\u2003\nto reflect the seriousness of the \noffense, to promote respect for the law, and \nto provide just punishment for the offense;\n(B)\u2003\nto afford adequate deterrence to \ncriminal conduct;\n(C)\u2003 to protect the public from further \ncrimes of the defendant; and\n(D)\u2003 to provide the defendant with needed \neducational or vocational training, medical \ncare, or other correctional treatment in the \nmost effective manner;\n(3)\u2003 the kinds of sentences available;\n(4)\u2003 the kinds of sentence and the sentencing \nrange established for\u2014\n\n5\n(A)\u2003 the applicable category of offense \ncommitted by the applicable category of \ndefendant as set forth in the guidelines\u2014\n(i)\u2003 issued by the Sentencing Commission \npursuant to section 994(a)(1) of title \n28, United States Code, subject to any \namendments made to such guidelines by \nact of Congress (regardless of whether such \namendments have yet to be incorporated \nby the Sentencing Commission into \namendments issued under section 994(p) \nof title 28); and\n(ii)\u2003 that, except as provided in section \n3742(g), are in effect on the date the \ndefendant is sentenced; or\n(B)\u2003 in the case of a violation of probation \nor supervised release, the applicable \nguidelines or policy statements issued by the \nSentencing Commission pursuant to section \n994(a)(3) of title 28, United States Code, \ntaking into account any amendments made \nto such guidelines or policy statements by \nact of Congress (regardless of whether such \namendments have yet to be incorporated \nby the Sentencing Commission into \namendments issued under section 994(p) \nof title 28);\n(5)\u2003 any pertinent policy statement\u2014\n(A)\u2003 issued by the Sentencing Commission \npursuant to section 994(a)(2) of title \n\n6\n28, United States Code, subject to \nany amendments made to such policy \nstatement by act of Congress (regardless \nof whether such amendments have yet to be \nincorporated by the Sentencing Commission \ninto amendments issued under section \n994(p) of title 28); and\n(B)\u2003 that, except as provided in section \n3742(g), is in effect on the date the defendant \nis sentenced.\n(6)\u2003 the need to avoid unwarranted sentence \ndisparities among defendants with similar \nrecords who have been found guilty of similar \nconduct; and\n(7)\u2003 the need to provide restitution to any \nvictims of the offense.\nSTATEMENT\nUnlike every other sentencing option, Congress \nintended supervised release to fulfill only nonretributive \ngoals. Congress thus omitted 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s \nretribution factors from the list for courts to consider \nwhen imposing, terminating, modifying, or revoking \nsupervised release, thereby precluding courts from \nconsidering those factors.\nThe Sentencing Reform Act (\u201cSRA\u201d) lists sentencing \nfactors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03553(a), and other provisions instruct \ncourts what to do with those factors when considering \nthe four sentencing options\u2014probation, fine, prison, and \n\n7\nsupervised release. Supervised release is different from \nthe others. For the first three options, the applicable \nstatutes include Section 3553(a)(2)(A) among the list \nof factors for courts to consider when imposing the \nsentence. For supervised release, the statute omits \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A). See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(c). Similarly, \nwhen modifying or revoking probation, the applicable \nstatute includes Section 3553(a)(2)(A) among the list \nof factors for courts to consider. When modifying or \nrevoking supervised release, the statute omits Section \n3553(a)(2)(A). See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(e). That difference in \nlanguage indicates a difference in meaning: courts may not \nconsider the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors when imposing \nsupervised release (as both this Court and the Government \nsaid in Tapia v. United States) and may not consider them \nwhen modifying or revoking supervised release.\nThat difference in language is also no accident. Unlike \nthe other three sentencing options, supervised release \ndoes not stand alone. It is a discretionary supplement \nthat follows a prison term. A prison term itself fulfills all \nthe sentencing factors, including the need for retributive \npunishment under Section 3553(a)(2)(A). The purpose of \nsupervised release, as expressed through the statute\u2019s \ntext, is to protect the public while providing rehabilitative \nsupport as a defendant transitions out of prison and back \ninto society. The sentencing court imposes conditions \nto further those forward-looking goals. When a person \nviolates the supervised-release conditions, a court may \nfurther those goals by, for example, incarcerating the \ndefendant to protect the public or to compel compliance \nwith the conditions imposed. Backward-looking retributive \npunishment is a matter for a separate prosecution, if \nappropriate, and not for a revocation proceeding.\n\n8\nIn the decisions below, the court of appeals nevertheless \nheld that Section 3583(e) allows courts to consider \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution factors when revoking \nsupervised release. That conclusion nullifies the textual \ndifferences between Section 3583(e) and its neighboring \nstatutes, and it ignores Congress\u2019s distinct purposes \nfor supervised release. To give effect to the text and \nto reflect Congress\u2019s intent as expressed in the SRA, \nthis Court should reverse the judgment of the court of \nappeals and hold that Section 3583(e) precludes courts \nfrom considering the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors when \nmodifying or revoking supervised release.\nI.\t Legal Background\nThrough the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, Pub. \nL. No. 98-473, 98 Stat. 1987, Congress eliminated \nindeterminate sentencing and parole, replacing that \nsystem with determinate sentences (subject to limited \nexceptions). Recognizing that some offenders would need \nrehabilitation or other assistance transitioning back into \nsociety, Congress created supervised release, a new \ndiscretionary supplement to follow a prison sentence. See \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583. Unlike parole, supervised release does \nnot replace a portion of the defendant\u2019s prison sentence, \nbut rather supports rehabilitation after a prison sentence \nis complete. Id.; United States v. Johnson, 529 U.S. 53, \n59 (2000).\nIn the SRA and subsequent amendments, Congress \nadopted sentencing factors for courts to consider and \nspecified how those factors apply differently to different \nsentencing options. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03553(a) (factors); \n3562(a) (probation); 3572(a) (fines); 3582(a) (prison); \n\n9\n3583(c) (supervised release). Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2014the \nneed for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the \noffense, promote respect for the law, and provide just \npunishment\u2014is included in the list of factors for courts \nto consider when imposing probation, a fine, or prison. \nSee 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03562(a) (probation); 3572(a) (fine); 3582(a) \n(prison). It is omitted from the list of factors to consider \nwhen imposing supervised release. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(c). \nLikewise, Section 3553(a)(2)(A) is included in the list of \nfactors for courts to consider when modifying or revoking \nprobation. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03565(a). It is omitted from the \nlist of factors to consider when modifying or revoking \nsupervised release. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(e).\nII.\t Proceedings Below\nEdgardo Esteras, Timothy Jaimez (fka Timothy \nWatters), and Toriano Leaks, Jr., each were charged \nwith and convicted of a federal crime. After completing \na custodial sentence, each began serving a term of \nsupervised release. The district courts later found that \neach of them violated conditions of supervised release, \nand the courts revoked supervised release and imposed \nnew terms of incarceration. During their revocation \nproceedings, the courts expressly relied on one or more \nof the factors set forth in Section 3553(a)(2)(A). The court \nof appeals affirmed their sentences.\na.\u2003 Edgardo Esteras\u2019s Revocation Proceedings. After \na contested hearing, the district court found that Esteras \nviolated his supervised-release conditions by possessing \na firearm. When making its factual findings, the court \nreferred to \u201cthe punishment I will issue today.\u201d JA 94a. \nThe court revoked Esteras\u2019s supervised release and varied \n\n10\nupward from the 6-to-12-month advisory guidelines range, \nsentencing him to 24 months in prison and three years of \nsupervised release. JA 98a, 116a.\nEsteras objected that \u201cthe Court indicated that it \nconsidered factors\u2014the factor in Section 3553(a)(2)(A) as \npart of its sentence.\u201d JA 105a. The district court confirmed \nthat \u201cpart of my contemplation certainly is the need for the \nsentence imposed, to promote respect for the law\u201d\u2014one \nof the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors. Id. In a later written \norder, the court stated that it \u201cconsidered the factors and \nconditions for sentencing listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03553(a) and \n3583(d), respectively.\u201d JA 115a. The court specifically \nnoted that it varied upwards and imposed a 24-month \nprison term to, among other reasons, \u201cpromote respect for \nthe law\u201d\u2014one of the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors. JA 116a.\nEsteras appealed. In an unpublished order, the Sixth \nCircuit affirmed Esteras\u2019s sentence. Bound by that court\u2019s \nprior decision in United States v. Lewis, 498 F.3d 393 \n(6th Cir. 2007), the panel held that \u201c\u2018it does not constitute \nreversible error to consider \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A) when imposing \na sentence for violation of supervised release, even though \nthis factor is not enumerated in \u00a7\u00a0 3583(e).\u2019\u201d JA 119a \n(quoting Lewis, 498 F.3d at 399-400).\nEsteras petitioned for rehearing en banc. In response, \nthe panel issued an amended order, and the court denied \nrehearing en banc. JA 121a-135a; JA 136a-137a. The panel \nmajority reaffirmed the holding in Lewis that district \ncourts may consider the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors \nwhen revoking supervised release. JA 128a. Two judges \npublished dissents from the order denying rehearing en \nbanc. JA 137a-149a. Esteras again petitioned for rehearing \n\n11\nen banc, which the court again denied over two published \ndissents. JA 150a-154a.\nb.\u2003 Timothy Jaimez\u2019s Revocation Proceedings. Jaimez \nadmitted to violating his supervised-release conditions \nby committing a new offense (a state misdemeanor \nfor attempted trafficking marijuana), associating with \nconvicted felons, and possessing drug paraphernalia. JA \n230a. The district court revoked his supervised release \nand sentenced him to 60 months in prison,\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n29: 20250115171916052_23-7483bsUnitedStates.json (score: 0.360)\nNo. 23-7483 \nIn the Supreme Court of the United States\n \nEDGARDO ESTERAS; TIMOTHY MICHAEL JAIMEZ F/K/A \nTIMOTHY M.

In 2023, after each petitioner violated one or \nmore terms of his supervised release, the district court \nrevoked each petitioner\u2019s supervised release and re-\nquired reimprisonment.  J.A. 110a-116a, 227a-228a, \n247a-248a.  In each case, the court of appeals affirmed.  \nJ.A. 121a-135a, 229a-236a, 249a-251a. \nA. Legal Background \n1. In the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (Sentenc-\ning Reform Act), Pub. L. No. 98-473, Tit. II, ch. II,  \n\u00a7 212(a)(2), 98 Stat. 1987, Congress enacted \u201csweeping \nreforms\u201d to the nation\u2019s criminal justice system.  Mis-\ntretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 366 (1989).  Among \nthose reforms was the introduction of supervised re-\nlease into the federal criminal system to replace \u201cmost \nforms of parole.\u201d  Cornell Johnson v. United States, 529 \nU.S. 694, 696 (2000). \nSupervised release is \u201ca form of postconfinement \nmonitoring\u201d that \u201cfacilitate[s] a transition to commu-\nnity life\u201d after a term of imprisonment.  Mont v. United \nStates, 587 U.S. 514, 523 (2019) (citation and internal quo-\ntation marks omitted); see S. Rep. No. 225, 98th Cong., \n1st Sess. 125 (1983) (Senate Report).  It allows offenders \nto serve \u201cpart of the[ir] sentence\u201d out of prison, subject  \nto conditions on their behavior.  18 U.S.C. 3583(a); see \n18 U.S.C. 3583(d).  Some conditions, such as not com-\nmitting additional crimes and drug testing, are manda-\ntory; the court also has discretion to specify additional \nconditions.  See 18 U.S.C. 3583(d). \n\n4 \n \n2. As originally enacted in the Sentencing Reform \nAct, the supervised-release statute (18 U.S.C. 3583) \nprovided a mechanism for early termination of the  \nsupervised-release term (thereby discharging the of-\nfender from the requirements of supervision), as well as \nmechanisms for otherwise adjusting the length and con-\nditions of the supervised-release term.  See Sentencing \nReform Act, 98 Stat. 2000.  But the statute did not pro-\nvide a mechanism for revoking a term of supervised re-\nlease in the event of a violation.  See Sentencing Reform \nAct, 98 Stat. 1999-2000; Senate Report 125.  Instead, it \nauthorized the court to treat a violation \u201cas contempt of \ncourt pursuant to [18 U.S.C. 401(3)].\u201d  Sentencing Re-\nform Act, 98 Stat. 2000. \nIn the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-\n570, 100 Stat. 3207, Congress amended Section 3583(e) \nto add what is now Section 3583(e)(3).  The new provi-\nsion allowed a court to revoke an offender\u2019s supervised \nrelease, and require a term of reimprisonment, if the of-\nfender violated one or more conditions of his release.  \nSee ibid.  The primary purpose of that provision is to \nallow a court to \u201csanction\u201d an offender\u2019s \u201cbreach of trust\u201d \nin committing such a violation.  Sentencing Guidelines \nCh. 7, Pt. A, \u00a7 3(b); see Sentencing Guidelines Ch. 7, Pt. \nB, intro. comment. (setting out \u201cpenalties  * * *  for the \nviolation of the judicial order imposing supervision\u201d); \nsee also Cornell Johnson, 529 U.S. at 700-701.  The term \nof reimprisonment is attributable \u201cto the original con-\nviction,\u201d rather than a sentence for a new offense.  Cor-\nnell Johnson, 529 U.S. at 701. \n3. The provision governing the imposition of a term \nof imprisonment, Section 3582(a), provides that a court, \n\u201cin determining whether to impose a term of imprison-\nment, and, if a term of imprisonment is to be imposed, \n\n5 \n \nin determining the length of the term, shall consider the \nfactors set forth in [18 U.S.C.] 3553(a) to the extent that \nthey are applicable, recognizing that imprisonment is \nnot an appropriate means of promoting correction and \nrehabilitation.\u201d  Section 3553 lists a number of factors \nthat a \u201ccourt, in determining the particular sentence to \nbe imposed, shall consider.\u201d  18 U.S.C. 3553(a).   \nMultiple provisions of the supervised-release statute \ncross-reference subsets of the Section 3553(a) factors.  \nMost relevant here, Section 3583(c) states that a court, \n\u201cin determining whether to include a term of supervised \nrelease, and, if a term of supervised release is to be in-\ncluded, in determining the length of the term and the \nconditions of supervised release, shall consider the fac-\ntors set forth in section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), \n(a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7).\u201d  18 U.S.C. \n3583(c).  The same factors are then listed, in slightly dif-\nferent language, as considerations under Section 3583(e), \nwhich covers termination, extension, modification, and \ndiscretionary revocation of supervised release.  See 18 \nU.S.C. 3583(e).  In the revocation context, the statute \nstates that a court \u201cmay, after considering the factors set \nforth in section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), \n(a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7)  * * *  revoke a term of \nsupervised release, and require the defendant to serve\u201d \na term of imprisonment.  18 U.S.C. 3583(e)(3). \nThe factors cross-referenced in Section 3583(c) and  \nSection 3583(e) include the \u201cnature and circumstances \nof the offense\u201d and \u201cthe history and characteristics of \nthe defendant,\u201d 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(1); the need for the \nsentence imposed to \u201cadequate[ly] deter[]\u201d crime and \n\u201cprotect the public,\u201d 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2)(B) and (C); \nthe need to \u201cprovide the defendant with needed educa-\n\n6 \n \ntional or vocational training, medical care, or other cor-\nrectional treatment,\u201d 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2)(D); \u201cthe kinds \nof sentence and the sentencing range\u201d recommended by \nthe Sentencing Guidelines, 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(4)(A); per-\ntinent \u201cpolicy statements\u201d issued by the Sentencing \nCommission for \u201cviolation[s] of probation or supervised \nrelease,\u201d 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(4)(B); other pertinent policy \nstatements issued by the Sentencing Commission, 18 \nU.S.C. 3553(a)(5)(A); the need to avoid unwarranted \nsentence disparities, 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(6); and the need \nto provide restitution to victims, 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(7). \nThe factors that a court is required to consider when \nimposing a sentence for a criminal conviction, but that \nare not cross-referenced in Section 3583(e), are the  \nfactors set out in Section 3553(a)(2)(A) and Section \n3553(a)(3).  Those non-cross-referenced factors are \u201cthe \nneed for the sentence imposed  * * *  to reflect the seri-\nousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, \nand to provide just punishment for the offense,\u201d 18 \nU.S.C. 3553(a)(2)(A), and \u201cthe kinds of sentences avail-\nable,\u201d 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(3). \n4. In some circumstances, such as when an offender \nviolates his supervised release by possessing drugs or a \nfirearm, revocation and reimprisonment are mandatory \nunder 18 U.S.C. 3583(g).  Section 3583(g) caps that term \nof reimprisonment at the maximum authorized under \nSection 3583(e)(3), but does not provide a particular set \nof factors for a court to consider in determining how \nlong that term should be. \n\n7 \n \nB. Factual And Procedural Background \n1. Esteras\u2019s Revocation Proceedings \na. In 2018, petitioner Esteras pleaded guilty to con-\nspiring to distribute and to possess with intent to dis-\ntribute heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1) and \n846.  J.A. 110a, 122a.  The district court varied below the \nrecommendation of the Sentencing Guidelines to im-\npose a sentence consisting of 12 months of imprison-\nment (to run consecutively to a 15-month prison term \nfor violating his probation for a prior federal drug- \ntrafficking conviction), to be followed by six years of su-\npervised release.  J.A. 122a. \nIn January 2020, Esteras was released from prison \nand began serving his six-year term of supervised re-\nlease.  J.A. 122a.  In January 2023, the Probation Office \nreported to the district court that Esteras had violated \nterms of his supervised release by (1) committing do-\nmestic violence, aggravated menacing, and criminal dam-\naging in violation of state law, and (2) possessing a fire-\narm.  J.A. 112a, 122a.  The report stated that, on Janu-\nary 23, 2023, Esteras had struck the mother of his chil-\ndren in the head, pointed a handgun at her, threatened \nto kill her, and fired three rounds from his handgun into \nher vehicle.  J.A. 112a. \nFollowing a revocation hearing, the district court \nfound that Esteras had \u201cbrandished and shot a firearm\u201d \nin the manner that the victim had described, as memo-\nrialized in body-camera video evidence.  J.A. 93a.  And \nthe court explained that whether or not Esteras had vi-\nolated state law, he had \u201cviolated [his] term of supervi-\nsion by possessing a [firearm].\u201d  J.A. 94a.  The court was \nthus \u201cobligated,  * * *  pursuant to [Section 3583(g)], to \nrevoke\u201d Esteras\u2019s supervision.  J.A. 93a; see 18 U.S.C. \n3583(g). \n\n8 \n \nBefore deciding on the appropriate course for \nEsteras\u2019s supervised-release violation, the district \ncourt recounted Esteras\u2019s prior federal offenses, noted \nthat Esteras was \u201cno stranger to federal court\u201d or to \n\u201claw violations,\u201d and observed that \u201cwhat\u2019s been done \nbefore [wa]sn\u2019t sufficient enough to deter [him], to en-\ncourage [him] to be respectful of the law, to be law- \nabiding.\u201d  J.A. 96a.  In particular, the court \u201cworr[ied]\u201d \nthat sentences for previous drug crimes, and revocation \nof a prior term of supervised release, had failed \u201cto de-\nter [Esteras], to encourage [him] to be respectful of the \nlaw.\u201d  Ibid.  And the court was \u201cnot really sure what it \nwill require for [Esteras] to learn that enough is \nenough.\u201d  Ibid. \nThe district court stated that it would now \u201cescalate \nthe consequences\u201d by \u201cexercising [its] discretion to vary \nupwards\u201d from the term of reimprisonment recom-\nmended by the Sentencing Guidelines, because Esteras\u2019s \n\u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cdisrespectful\u201d behavior was \u201c[a]typi-\ncal\u201d and \u201cexceptional\u201d and \u201cmust stop.\u201d  J.A. 97a-98a.  \nThe court explained that if Esteras could not \u201cstop \n[him]self,\u201d the court would \u201cseparate [him] from society \nfor long enough to at least allow [him] to reconsider his \nbehavior,\u201d so that \u201chopefully when [he] return[s] under \nthe new term of supervision\u201d that would follow the re-\nimprisonment, he would \u201cdo better.\u201d  J.A. 98a. \nThe district court required 24 months of imprison-\nment, to be followed by three more years of supervised \nrelease.  J.A. 98a.  As to the latter, the court carried \nover Esteras\u2019s prior conditions of supervised release \nand added requirements that Esteras submit to an an-\nger management program and that he \u201cbe on location \nmonitoring with a curfew\u201d for the first six months of his \nnew supervised-release term.  J.A. 99a, 101a.  The court \n\n9 \n \nnoted that Esteras\u2019s\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n10: 20240722142938345_Extension20Letter2023-7483202nd.json (score: 0.357)\nU.S. Department of Justice \n \nOffice of the Solicitor General \n \n \n \n \nThe Solicitor General  \n Washington, D.C. 20530 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJuly 22, 2024 \n \n \nHonorable Scott S.

Under the Government\u2019s telling, those factors \nare nevertheless permissible to consider; in fact, it is \nimpossible not to, and Congress had no apparent reason \nfor choosing to omit Section 3553(a)(2)(A) from the list.\nThere was a reason: Congress omitted factors that it \nintended to preclude. That was the Government\u2019s previous \nposition, which reflects a traditional rule of statutory \nconstruction: expressio unius est exclusio alterius. The \nGovernment spends much of its brief arguing that there \nare other ways to preclude relying on certain factors, such \nas by using the word \u201conly.\u201d But those methods are not \nnecessary when the text is otherwise clear, as it is here.\nCongress precluded courts from relying on Section \n3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution factors to keep retributive \npunishment out of supervised-release considerations, both \nwhen courts impose supervised release and when they \nterminate, modify, or revoke it.1 That is consistent with \nthe text of Section 3583(c) and (e), the textual differences \nbetween Section 3583 and neighboring statutes, and the \n1.\u2002 The Government claims that \u201cretributive punishment\u201d is \n\u201csimply petitioners\u2019 gloss\u201d on Section 3553(a)(2)(A). Gov\u2019t Br. at \n35. Not so. It reflects how both this Court and the Senate Report \nhave described Section 3553(a)(2)(A). See Tapia v. United States, \n564 U.S. 319, 326 (2011) (noting that \u201cretribution\u201d is \u201cthe first \npurpose listed in \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)\u201d); S. Rep. No. 98-225, at 75 (1983) \n(explaining that the \u201cfirst purpose listed\u201d in Section 3553(a)(2) is \n\u201cessentially the \u2018just deserts\u2019 concept\u201d).\n\n2\nhistory of the Sentencing Reform Act. In particular, \nit reflects the textual differences between the statutes \ngoverning probation and governing supervised release, \nconsistent with the different histories and structures of \nthose provisions.\nThe Government\u2019s contrary approach is inconsistent \nwith the text and the history of the statute. It is also \ninternally inconsistent, claiming that precluding omitted \nfactors is not feasible but also that Congress did so \nelsewhere. And it introduces intractable interpretive \nproblems, assigning different meanings to provisions with \nthe same listed factors (Sections 3583(c) and (e)) but the \nsame meaning to provisions with different listed factors \n(Sections 3565(a) and 3583(e)).\nCongress\u2019s deliberate choice to preclude relying \non Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution factors was not a \nsemantic formality. Congress took a different approach \nto imposing and to terminating, modifying, and revoking \nsupervised release than it did with all other federal \nsentencing options. Following the text as written is \na practicable framework that implements Congress\u2019s \nsubstantive design for supervised release.\nI.\t The Government\u2019s approach would render \nmeaningless Congress\u2019s deliberate choice to exclude \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A) from Section 3583(e)\u2019s list of \nfactors.\nCongress made a deliberate choice to omit Section \n3553(a)(2)(A) from Section 3583(e)\u2019s list of factors, and \nthat choice was not meaningless. It precludes courts \nfrom considering the (a)(2)(A) factors when terminating, \nmodifying, or revoking supervised release.\n\n3\nThe Government contrasts Section 3583(e) with \nseveral other provisions, but the key comparison is with \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03565(a), which applies when courts modify \nor revoke probation. The two provisions use identical \nlanguage except for different listed factors. Compare 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03565(a) (permitting a court to modify or revoke \nprobation \u201cafter considering the factors set forth in section \n3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable\u201d), with 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(e) (permitting a court to modify or revoke \nsupervised release \u201cafter considering the factors set forth in \nsection 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), \n(a)(6), and (a)(7)\u201d). The only interpretation that gives \neffect to the textual difference between the statutes is \nthat Section 3583(e) precludes courts from relying on the \n(a)(2)(A) factors. Under the Government\u2019s interpretation, \nthe two provisions would mean the same thing\u2014consider \nany factors to the extent that they apply\u2014and Congress\u2019s \ndecision to omit Section 3553(a)(2)(A) in Section 3583(e) \nwould be meaningless. See Pet. Br. at 13, 21-22. The \nGovernment\u2019s brief does not mention Section 3565(a).\nThe negative-implication canon, expressio unius \nest exclusio alterius, is strongest when text is included \nin one statute but omitted from a neighbor. Bittner v. \nUnited States, 598 U.S. 85, 94 (2023). It is even stronger \nwhen the neighboring statutes use otherwise-identical \nlanguage. And it gives effect to Congress\u2019s deliberate \nchoice to exclude Section 3553(a)(2)(A) from the list in \nSection 3583(e).\nThe Government\u2019s approach also would make the \nomission in Section 3583(e) meaningless in another way. \nAlthough the Government says the omission means that the \nlisted factors are mandatory and the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) \n\n4\nfactors are permissive, Gov\u2019t Br. at 16-17, it also says that \nthe factors \u201cinherently overlap,\u201d id. at 16, and further that \nit is \u201call but impossible,\u201d id. at 20, and not \u201cfeasible,\u201d id. \nat 35, to consider the listed factors without considering \nthe (a)(2)(A) factors. Thus, according to the Government, \nSection 3583(e) permits courts to consider the (a)(2)(A) \nfactors while mandating the rest, but it is impossible to \nconsider the rest without considering the (a)(2)(A) factors, \nso a statute in which Congress deliberately chose to omit \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A) actually mandates considering \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A).\nCongress\u2019s decision to omit Section 3553(a)(2)(A) \nwas not meaningless. It precludes courts from considering \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution factors when \nterminating, modifying, or revoking supervised release.\nII. The Government\u2019s approach creates conflicts with \nother provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act that \nthe plain text avoids.\nThe Government claims that interpreting Section \n3583(e) to preclude relying on the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) \nfactors would conflict with other provisions of the SRA. \nThat is not accurate. The Government\u2019s approach, not \npetitioners\u2019, would create new interpretive problems, \nincluding reading identical text in the same provision to \nmean different things.\na.\u2003 The Government argues that Congress could have \nused the word \u201conly\u201d or similar language to indicate that \nthe omitted factor was precluded. Gov\u2019t Br. at 23. True \nenough. Congress also could have done what it did here\u2014\nused the \u201cancient maxim\u201d of expressio unius est exclusio \n\n5\nalterius, Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of R.R. \nPassengers, 414 U.S. 453, 458 (1974), to convey the same \nmeaning. Using additional limiting language was not \nnecessary, particularly given the close textual similarities \nbetween Sections 3565(a) and 3583(e).\nThe Government asserts that, because Congress used \nthe word \u201conly\u201d or other limiting language in unrelated \ncontexts elsewhere in Section 3583, Congress could not \nhave meant to preclude relying on Section 3553(a)(2)(A) \nwithout using the word \u201conly\u201d in Section 3583(e). Gov\u2019t \nBr. at 24, 27-29. That conclusion does not follow. There are \nseveral provisions throughout the SRA where Congress \ndid not use \u201conly\u201d but indisputably limited court actions \nto what is stated. Section 3583(e) itself states that a court \nmay terminate supervised release, extend or modify it, \nrevoke it, or impose home confinement. See 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a03583(e). It does not say that a court may do \u201conly\u201d those \nthings, but the same principle\u2014the negative-implication \ncanon\u2014dictates that the listed actions are the only options \navailable, and not, say, imposing a fine. See Barnhart v. \nPeabody Coal Co., 537 U.S. 149, 168 (2003) (noting that \nthe negative-implication canon has \u201cforce\u201d when \u201cthe \nitems expressed are members of an associated group or \nseries, justifying the inference that items not mentioned \nwere excluded by deliberate choice, not inadvertence\u201d). \nSimilarly, Section 3583(e)(3) states that a court may \nrevoke supervised release if it finds by a preponderance \nof the evidence that the defendant violated a condition \nof supervised release. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(e). It does \nnot say \u201conly,\u201d but Congress\u2019s meaning again is clear: \na court may not revoke supervised release when it does \nnot find that a person violated a condition, and it may not \napply a different burden of proof. Congress used \u201conly\u201d \n\n6\nwhen it was necessary to do so, as in Section 3583(d) \nwhen specifying the limited circumstances under which \nintermittent confinement could be imposed. See 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a03583(d) (discussing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03563(b)(10)). Congress \ndid not when its meaning was otherwise clear, as when \nit omitted Section 3553(a)(2)(A) from the lists in Section \n3583(c), (d), and (e).\nEven the Government recognizes that the negative-\nimplication canon still applies in Section 3583(e). It \nargues that petitioners ask the Court to make the \u201cwrong \ninference,\u201d though, because the canon applies to \u201cafter \nconsidering\u201d but not to the listed and omitted factors. \nGov\u2019t Br. at 30. There is no apparent reason for this \ndistinction, and again the Government ignores the key \ncomparison to Section 3565(a). Regardless, this is yet \nanother provision in Section 3583 that does not use the \nword \u201conly,\u201d yet Congress\u2019s meaning is apparent.\nb.\u2003 The Government claims that petitioners\u2019 approach \ncreates an \u201canomaly\u201d with Section 3583(g) that its \napproach does not. Gov\u2019t Br. at 25-26. Not so. First, the \nbetter reading of 3583(g) is that it sets forth situations \nwhere revocation under Section 3583(e)(3) is mandatory, \nnot that it is wholly separate from (e)(3). Section 3583(e) \nincludes not only what factors to consider in revocation \nproceedings, but also what procedures to use and what \nburden of proof to apply. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(e)(3). Section \n3583(g) does not contain any of this. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(g). \nIf Section 3583(g) were seen as an independent revocation \nprovision, separate from Section 3583(e), it would lack \nprocedures to implement it and a burden of proof, and \nit would be the only sentence in the SRA (along with the \nequivalent probation provision, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03565(b)) for \n\n7\nwhich Congress did not specify what sentencing factors \nto apply. Cf. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03562(a) (specifying factors to \napply when imposing probation); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0 3565(a) \n(modifying or revoking probation); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03572(a) \n(imposing fine); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03582(a) (imposing prison); 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(c) (imposing supervised release); 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a03583(e) (modifying or revoking supervised release). \nUnderstanding Section 3583(g) as specifying situations \nwhere revocation under Section 3583(e) is mandatory, \nthere is no anomaly.\nEven if the Government were correct, though, its \napproach would not avoid the anomaly that it says exists. \nThe Government claims that it would be \u201cinexplicable\u201d for \nCongress to preclude considering Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s \nretribution factors in Section 3583(e)(3) revocations but \nnot in Section 3583(g) revocations. Gov\u2019t Br. at 26. But it \nis just as inexplicable that Congress would merely permit \nconsidering Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution factors \nin Section 3583(e) revocations but make those factors \nmandatory in Section 3583(g) revocations.\nSection 3583(g) reflects Congress\u2019s judgment that \ncertain violations require court intervention via revocation, \nthough perhaps for as short as one day in custody before \nreturning to supervised release. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(g). \nIt does not alter what Congress instructed when it chose \nto omit Section 3553(a)(2)(A) from Section 3583(e)\u2019s list \nof factors to consider when terminating, modifying, or \nrevoking supervised release.\nc.\u2003\nThe Government\u2019s approach would create \nadditional interpretive problems. The Government \nsuggests that the Court could interpret Section 3583(c) \n\n8\nand (e) to mean different things, repeatedly noting that the \ntwo subsections have \u201cdifferent wording (\u2018shall consider\u2019 \nversus \u2018after considering\u2019).\u201d Gov\u2019t Br. at 42, 44. But the two \nprovisions use the same listed factors: \u201cthe factors set forth \nin section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), \n(a)(6), and (a)(7),\u201d omitting Section 3553(a)(2)(A). 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a7\u00a03583(c), (e). Thus, the Government\u2019s interpretation \nwould create a difference between Sections 3583(c) and (e), \neven though those provisions use the same listed factors, \nin addition to erasing the textual difference between \nSections 3565(a) and 3583(e), even though those provisions \nuse different listed factors. See supra Section I.\nThe Government\u2019s claimed difference between \nSections 3583(c) and (e) would create an additional \nproblem: although a court could not impose supervised \nrelease based on Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution \nfactors, it could extend the term based on those factors \neven if nothing else changed. Note that, unlike before \nrevoking supervised release, Section 3583(e)(2) does not \nrequire a triggering event before a court extends a term \nof supervised release\u2014it requires only that the court \nconsider the listed factors. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(e)(2). \nThus, if Section 3583(c) precluded considering the Section \n3553(a)(2)(A) factors but Section 3583(e) permitted it, a \ncourt could rely on only the listed factors when imposing \nsupervised release and determining the length of the \nterm, then at any time later extend the term based on \nthe court\u2019s view that the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors \nwarranted an extended term as punishment that the court \ninitially could not consider.\nThe better view is that Sections 3583(c) and (e) both \npreclude considering Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution \nfactors, because the two subsections list the same factors \n\n9\nto consider and omit the same factors to preclude. See \nPet. Br. at 17-19, 20-22. In the context of Section 3583, the \ndifference between \u201cshall consider\u201d in Section 3583(c) and \n\u201cafter considering\u201d in Section 3583(e) is what the listed \nfactors apply to, not the substance. Congress used \u201cafter \nconsidering\u201d to apply the listed factors to the different \npossible court actions that follow in Section 3583(e), the \nsame as if it instead had listed the factors in each of the \nfour subsections. Cf. Pulsifer v. United States, 601 U.S. \n124, 137 (2024) (\u201cCongress, we recognize, just opted to \ndraft more concisely.\u201d).\nUnderstanding the identical lists in Sections 3583(c) \nand (e) to have the same meaning reveals additional \nproblems with the Government\u2019s approach. First, just as \nSections 3565(a) and 3583(e) use identical language except \nfor different listed factors governing revoking probation \nand revoking supervised release, so do Sections 3562(a) \nand 3583(c) use identical language except for different \nlisted factors governing imposing probation and imposing \nsupervised release. Compare 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03562(a) (\u201cshall \nconsider the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the \nextent that they are applicable\u201d), with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(c) \n(\u201cshall consider the factors set forth in section 3553(a)(1), \n(a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7)\u201d). \nThus, just as the Government\u2019s interpretation would \nerase the textual differences between Sections 3565(a) \nand 3583(e), see supra Section I, so too would it erase the \ntextual differences between Sections 3562(a) and 3583(c).\nSecond, because their identical lists of factors carry \nthe same meaning, the history behind Section 3583(c) is \nequally informative in interpreting Section 3583(e). The \nGovernment argues that those authorities do not matter \n\n10\nbecause, in its view, revocation under Section 3583(e) is \ndifferent from imposition under Section 3583(c). See Gov\u2019t \nBr. at 19, 40. Recognizing that the lists in Sections 3583(c) \nand (e) have the same meaning, though, that argument \ncollapses.\nIII.\tThe Government\u2019s approach is inconsistent with \nthe history of the Sentencing Reform Act.\nThe SRA\u2019s history further bolsters petitioners\u2019 \nposition. Congress created supervised release to encourage \nrehabilitation and supervise an offender\u2019s transition back \ninto society, following a prison term that previously \nfulfilled the need for retributive punishment. It thus \nprecluded courts from considering Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s \nretribution factors when imposing supervised release \nand when terminating or modifying supervised release, \nby using the same listed factors in the statutory \nprovision governing each. Importantly, Congress created \nsupervised release to be different from probation, which \ncould be imposed as a complete sentence on its own and \nfor which Congress included Section 3553(a)(2)(A) in the \nlist of factors to consider. Congress made a deliberate \nchoice to use different text in the statutes governing \nprobation and governing supervised release, and those \ntextual differences reflected Congress\u2019s different goals. \nSee Pet. Br. at 24-28.\nThe Government contorts the SRA\u2019s history to claim \nthat it supports a different view. It asserts that the \nSenate Report\u2019s discussion of Section 3583(c) \u201cis wholly \nconsistent with the potential for permissive consideration \nof other factors.\u201d Gov\u2019t Br. at 39. But it ignores the clearest \nstatement on the issue: \u201cThe term of supervised release \n\n11\nis very similar to a term of probation, except that it \nfollows a term of imprisonment and may not be imposed \nfor purposes of punishment or incapacitation since those \npurposes will have been served to the extent necessary \nby the term of imprisonment.\u201d S. Rep. No. 98-225, at 125 \n(1983) (emphasis added). The Government shifts to claim \nthat the Report\u2019s discussion of Section 3583(c) provides \n\u201clittle insight\u201d into the interpretation of Section 3583(e). \nGov\u2019t Br. at 40. But the identical lists of factors in Sections \n3583(c) and (e) have the same meaning, see supra Section \nII.c, as the Senate Report expressly states, see S. Rep. \nNo. 98-225, at 124 (noting that Section 3583(e) directs \nthe court to \u201cconsider[] the same factors considered in \nthe original imposition of a term of supervised release\u201d).\nThe Government says that the Court should ignore \nthe original SRA and look instead to the intent of the 1986 \nCongress, which added Section 3583(e)(3)\u2019s revocation \nprovision. See Gov\u2019t Br. at 19. But the 1986 Congress \nnested the new revocation provision under the previously \nenacted Section 3583(e), without altering Section 3583(e)\u2019s \nlist of factors to consider. The Government offers nothing, \ntextual or otherwise, to suggest that the 1986 amendment \naltered the meaning of the unaltered lists of factors in \nSections 3583(c) and (e) as enacted in the SRA.\nIV.\tTapia v. United States supports petitioners.\nThis Court\u2019s decision in Tapia v. United States, 564 \nU.S. 319 (2011), also supports petitioners\u2019 interpretation \nof Section 3583(e). After describing the four purposes \nof sentencing\u2014retribution, deterrence, incapacitation, \nand rehabilitation\u2014as set forth in Section 3553(a)(2), the \nTapia Court observed that the SRA \u201cprovides additional \n\n12\nguidance\u201d about how those factors apply to different \nsentencing options. Id. at 325-26. \u201cThese provisions make \nclear that a particular purpose may apply differently, \nor not at all, depending on the kind of sentence under \nconsideration. For example, a court may not take account \nof retribution (the first purpose listed in \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)) when \nimposing a term of supervised release. See \u00a7\u00a03583(c).\u201d Id. \nat 326 (emphasis in original)). Because Sections 3583(c) \nand (e) contain the same listed factors, the same conclusion \nfollows for Section 3583(e). See Pet. Br. at 17-19, 20-22; \nsupra Section II.c.\nThe Tapia briefing provides further support. The \nGovernment itself stated: \u201cSection 3583(c) explicitly lists \neach Section 3553(a) factor that courts must consider \nand omits the factors whose consideration Congress \nintended to preclude. See 18 U.S.C. 3583(c).\u201d Reply Brief \nfor United States, Tapia v. United States, 564 U.S. 319 \n(2011) (No. 10-5400), 2011 U.S. S.\u00a0Ct. Briefs LEXIS 451, \n*20. That reflects a straightforward application of the \nnegative-implication canon. See Antonin Scalia & Bryan \nA. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal \nTexts 111 (2012) (\u201c[T]he negative-implication canon is \nso intuitive that courts often apply it correctly without \ncalling it by name.\u201d).\nThe Government now claims that it merely \u201caccepted \nthe amicus\u2019s characterization\u201d of Section 3583(c). Gov\u2019t \nBr. at 43 n.5. It did more than that. At issue in Tapia was \nthe partially restrictive language in Section 3582(a). The \nparties agreed that Section 3583(c)\u2019s limited list was a \nclearer way to preclude consideration of omitted factors. \nThe Government argued that \u201cSection 3583(c) removes \nmultiple Section 3553(a) factors from consideration \n\n13\n(Section 3553(a)(2)(A) and Section 3553(a)(3)).\u201d Reply Brief \nfor United States, Tapia v. United States, 564 U.S. 319 \n(2011) (No. 10-5400), 2011 U.S. S.\u00a0Ct. Briefs LEXIS 451, \n*20. It further argued that Congress did not use the same \nformulation in Section 3582(a) because there, it \u201cdid not \nintend to preclude courts from considering rehabilitative \npurposes entirely when making imprisonment decisions,\u201d \nid. at *21\u2014in contrast with Section 3583(c), which \nprecludes courts from considering retributive purposes \nentirely when making supervised-release decisions.\nThe Government here argues that language like \nin Section 3582(a) is required to do what, in Tapia, \nit said was clearer in Section 3583(c). See Gov\u2019t Br. \nat 28. The Government was right the first time. The \n\u201cintuitive\u201d negative-implication canon led it to the correct \ninterpretation, consistent with Congress\u2019s deliberate \nchoice to omit Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution factors.\nV.\t The Government\u2019s policy arguments are mistaken \nand do not warrant rejecting Congress\u2019s contrary \npolicy choice reflected in the statutory text.\nFinally, the Government asserts that it is not \n\u201cfeasible\u201d for courts to rely only on the factors listed \nin Section 3583(e) when terminating, modifying, or \nrevoking supervised release. Gov\u2019t Br. at 35. Those policy \narguments are wrong, and they do not justify abandoning \nthe plain meaning of the text.\na.\u2003 Experience since Tapia shows that Congress \ndid not give courts an impossible assignment in Sections \n3583(c) and (e) when it precluded considering the Section \n3553(a)(2)(A) factors. In Tapia, this Court stated that \n\n14\ndistrict courts could not rely on Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s \nretribution factors when imposing supervised release. \nSee Tapia, 564 U.S. at 326. There has been no confusion \nor rash of appeals since then, and courts of appeals have \nadopted practices to ensure that the district courts follow \nthis Court\u2019s ruling. See United States v. Wilcher, 91 F.4th \n864, 872 (7th Cir. 2024); United States v. Burden, 860 F.3d \n45, 57 (2d Cir. 2017).\nThe Government points to petitioners\u2019 proceedings, \nGov\u2019t Br. at 35, and decisions from the Ninth Circuit, Gov\u2019t \nBr. at 37, to argue the \u201cimpossibility\u201d of relying only on the \nfactors listed in Sections 3583(c) and (e), Gov\u2019t Br. at 36. \nBut the Sixth Circuit had previously held that courts could \nconsider any sentencing factor when revoking supervised \nrelease. See United States v. Lewis, 498 F.3d 393, 399-400 \n(6th Cir. 2007). It is no surprise, then, that the district \ncourts in petitioners\u2019 proceedings did not distinguish \nbetween permitted and precluded factors.2 Similarly, \nalthough the Ninth Circuit held that relying on omitted \nfactors \u201cwould be improper,\u201d United States v. Miqbel, 444 \nF.3d 1173, 1182 (9th Cir. 2006), it also adopted the atextual \nqualification that a sentence would be unreasonable only \n\u201cif the court based it primarily on an omitted factor,\u201d id. \n(emphasis added), inviting unnecessary confusion. Those \ndecisions indicate the importance of clear statements that \n2.\u2002 The courts made clear, though, that they relied on precluded \nfactors. The district court revoking Esteras\u2019s supervised release \nconfirmed that it relied on Section 3553(a)(2)(A) in response to an \nobjection, see JA 105a, the parties agreed that the court revoking \nJaimez\u2019s supervised release considered the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) \nfactors, see Gov\u2019t Supp. Br. at 6-7, Sixth Cir. No. 23-3189; JA 232a, \nand the court revoking Leaks\u2019s supervised release expressly \nrelied on the need to \u201cpunish Mr. Leaks for violating supervision,\u201d \nJA 244a.\n\n15\nomitted factors are precluded, but they do not indicate \nthat following Congress\u2019s instructions is impossible. The \nTenth Circuit, which adopted an unambiguous rule, has \nhad no similar difficulties. See United States v. Booker, 63 \nF.4th 1254, 1259-60 & n.1 (10th Cir. 2023); United States \nv. Waffle, No. 22-5084, 2023 WL 2964480, at *2 (10th Cir. \nApr. 17, 2023) (noting Government concession that district \ncourt erred under Booker by considering two Section \n3553(a)(2)(A) factors when revoking supervised release).\nThe Government claims that a court could not consider \nthe Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statements without \nconsidering the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors. Gov\u2019t Br. at \n34. But the Commission has published guidance stating \nthat, \u201cin a supervised release revocation proceeding, the \ncourt should consider all of the factors except section \n3553(a)(2)(A),\u201d U.S. Sentencing Commission, Federal \nSentencing: The Basics 57 n.186 (Sep. 2020),3 and it \nhas proposed amendments revising the background \ncommentary that the Government cites, see U.S. \nSentencing Commission, Proposed Amendments to the \nSentencing Guidelines (Preliminary) 30-32 (Jan. 24, \n2025).4 Regardless, the Court must interpret the statute \nconsistent with Congress\u2019s intent as reflected in the text, \nirrespective of what the Commission does. See United \nStates v. Labonte, 520 U.S. 751, 753 (1997); Neal v. United \nStates, 516 U.S. 284, 289-90 (1996).\n3.\u2002 Available at https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/\nresearch-and-publications/research-publications/2020/202009_\nfed-sentencing-basics.pdf.\n4.\u2002 Available at: https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/\namendment-process/reader-friendly-amendments/20250124_\nprelim_rf.pdf.\n\n16\nDistrict courts can follow the statute by relying on \nthe listed factors and not the precluded factors. That is \nwhat the Government said in Tapia, without expressing \nany concern about feasibility. Even now, the Government \nappears to recognize this\u2014it says that Congress \ninstructed courts to do so in Section 3583(d). See Gov\u2019t Br. \nat 28-29, 35-36. But it would be impossible there, too, if the \nGovernment were right that the distinction is impossible.\nb.\u2003 Congress enacted Sections 3553(a)(2)\u2019s subsections \nas distinct factors because they address different aspects \nof sentencing. They are not \u201cessentially redundant,\u201d as \nthe Esteras panel said. JA 128a. The Section 3553(a)(2)(A) \nfactors reflect retributive punishment, directing courts \nto consider not just \u201cthe seriousness of the offense,\u201d for \nexample, but \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed .\u00a0.\u00a0. to reflect \nthe seriousness of the offense,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A).5 \nSee Tapia, 564 U.S. at 326 (noting that \u201cretribution\u201d is \n\u201cthe first purpose listed in \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)\u201d); Miqbel, 444 \n5.\u2002 The Government states that \u201c[t]he \u2018offense\u2019 referred to \nin Section 3553(a)\u201d\u2014including Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s references \nto the seriousness of the offense and just punishment for the \noffense\u2014\u201cis the \u2018offense\u2019 of conviction, rather than violation of a \nsupervised-release condition.\u201d Gov\u2019t Br. at 33 n.2. Lower courts \ndo not consistently follow that view. See, e.g., United States v. \nSanchez, 900 F.3d 678, 683 n.3 (5th Cir. 2018) (construing \u201cthe \noffense\u201d to \u201cmean the conduct that constituted the violation \nof the conditions of supervised release\u201d); JA 244a (relying on \nthe need to \u201cpunish Mr. Leaks for violating supervision\u201d). But \nthe Government\u2019s formulation further shows that it is feasible \nfor courts to avoid relying on the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors \nwhen revoking supervised release. Courts can well avoid basing \nrevocation sentences on the need to reflect the seriousness of or \nprovide just punishment for the original offense.\n\n17\nF.3d at 1182 (noting that the need to promote respect \nfor the law and reflect the seriousness of the offense \u201cis \noften intertwined with the concept of punishment, as it \nis in \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A) itself\u201d). Those factors are backward-\nlooking, calling for a sentence proportional to the offense. \nSee S. Rep. No. 98-225, at 75 (explaining that the Section \n3553(a)(2)(A) factors are \u201canother way of saying that the \nsentence should reflect the gravity of the defendant\u2019s \nconduct\u201d). The other factors are forward-looking. For \nexample, \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed .\u00a0.\u00a0. to protect \nthe public from further crimes of the defendant,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(C), requires a determination about what is \nneeded for the future. A greater need to protect the public \nmight follow from a more severe offense or violation, \nbut it might not. For example, changed conditions after \neven a severe offense might indicate little likelihood of \nrepeat and thus little need to protect the public, whereas \notherwise-minor conduct that suggests a likelihood of \nescalating might indicate an increased need to protect the \npublic. Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution factors address \ndifferent aspects of sentencing than the listed factors.\nFollowing Congress\u2019s design is straightforward. \nSections 3583(c) and (e) permit courts to consider most \nof the various typical sentencing factors with broad \ndiscretion, but not Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution \nfactors. The lower courts have experience from other \ncontexts with considering whether to order a purpose \ninto custody for non-retributive purposes. See, e.g., 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03142(g) (pretrial detention); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4246 (civil \ncommitment); Gompers v. Bucks Stove & Range Co., 221 \nU.S. 418 (1911) (civil contempt). If a district court appears \nto rely on precluded factors, timely objections can allow \nthe court to clarify. See JA 105a; JA 245a. And appellate \n\n18\nreview will police the outer bounds of the district courts\u2019 \ndiscretion, just as it has done in the supervised-release-\nimposition context since Tapia.\nc.\u2003 The Government\u2019s arguments about feasibility \nare wrong, but more fundamentally, they ask the Court \nto \u201crewrite clear statutes under the banner of [its] own \npolicy concerns.\u201d Azar v. Allina Health Servs., 587 U.S. \n566, 581 (2019). Congress deliberately chose to omit \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A) from the listed factors in Sections \n3583(c) and (e), because it pursued a different policy than \nthe Government\u2019s preferred course. \u201cUltimately, the \nGovernment\u2019s policy arguments do not obscure what the \nstatutory language makes clear.\u201d Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Mfrs. v. \nDep\u2019t of Def., 583 U.S. 109, 131 (2018).\nCongress\u2019s policy decision was not merely a semantic \nformality, as the Government asserts. Gov\u2019t Br. at 37. Congress \ndeliberately chose to exclude Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s \nretribution factors when imposing and when terminating, \nmodifying, or revoking supervised release. It took a \ndifferent approach to post-sentencing supervision than \nit had done previously, see Pet. Br. at 23-25, and it took a \ndifferent approach to supervised release than it did for the \nother sentencing options\u2014prison, fine, or probation, see \nPet. Br. at 19-23, 25-28. Precluding courts from relying on \nthe Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors when revoking supervised \nrelease is not about \u201cmagic words\u201d or putting form over \nsubstance. Gov\u2019t Br. at 37. Precluding those factors is \nsubstantive, and it reflects Congress\u2019s decision that one of \nthe traditional sentencing factors\u2014retribution\u2014will not \nbe part of imposing supervised release and will not be part \nof terminating, modifying, or revoking supervised release. \nWhen courts rely on Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution \n\n19\nfactors when revoking supervised release, as the courts \ndid below, they have done what Congress prohibited.\nCONCLUSION\nThe judgments of the court of appeals should be \nreversed.\nRespectfully submitted,\nFebruary 2025\nJoseph Medici\nFederal Public Defender,\nSouthern District of Ohio\nKevin M.

Esteras \nPage 2 \n \n____________________ \nAMENDED ORDER \n____________________ \n \nSUTTON, Chief Judge.  Edgardo Esteras appeals the district court\u2019s order revoking his \nsupervised release and sentencing him to 24 months in prison.  We affirm the district court\u2019s \nrevocation order for the reasons that follow. \n \nIn 2018, Esteras pleaded guilty to conspiring to distribute and possess with intent to \ndistribute heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846.  Varying downward from a \nguidelines range of 15 to 21 months, the district court sentenced Esteras to 12 months of \nimprisonment, to be served consecutively with a 15-month prison term for violating his \nprobation for a prior federal drug-trafficking conviction, followed by six years of supervised \nrelease.  \n \nEsteras\u2019s six-year term of supervised release began in January 2020.  Three years later, in \nJanuary 2023, the probation officer reported to the district court that Esteras had violated the \nconditions of his supervised release (1) by committing domestic violence, aggravated menacing, \nand criminal damaging, and (2) by possessing a firearm.  The probation officer notified the \ndistrict court that the new criminal charges against Esteras had been dismissed at the victim\u2019s \nrequest.   \nJudge Benita Y. Pearson conducted a hearing and found that Esteras possessed a firearm \nwhile under supervised release.  She \u201cworr[ied]\u201d that her previous sentences for drug crimes and \nviolating an earlier supervised release term failed \u201cto deter [Esteras], to encourage [him] to be \nrespectful of the law.\u201d  R.439 at 83.  Based on his \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cdisrespectful\u201d behavior, she \nvaried upward from an advisory range of six to twelve months to impose a 24-month jail \nsentence, \u201clong enough to at least allow [Esteras] to reconsider [his] behavior.\u201d  Id. at 85.  She \nadded three years of supervised release to the sentence, including an anger management class \nand six months of location monitoring.  These conditions, Judge Pearson explained, would teach \nhim to \u201cdo better\u201d and \u201cthink before [he] act[s].\u201d  Id. \nAppendix B\n5a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 3 \n \n \nEsteras objected that the court should not have considered the three subfactors identified \nin 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) when crafting its sentence:  \u201cto reflect the seriousness of the \noffense, to promote respect for the law, and provide just punishment for the offense.\u201d  Id. at 92.  \nJudge Pearson agreed that \u201cpart of [her] contemplation certainly is the need for the sentence \nimposed, to promote respect for the law.\u201d  Id.  But she added that she also considered deterrence \nand community safety, which appear in other statutory provisions.  She also referenced her \ndecision to vary upward \u201cto separate Mr. Esteras from the average, typical, mine run-type \ndefendant.\u201d  Id.  \n \nIn closing the hearing, Judge Pearson expressed hope that Esteras would take advantage \nof this opportunity.  She acknowledged that some of the conventional features of supervised \nrelease could be seen as partly \u201cpunitive,\u201d such as location monitoring and other measures that \n\u201crestrict [his] freedom\u201d of movement.  Id.  She then referred to other terms, such as anger \nmanagement, as \u201cthere to bolster [him]\u201d and \u201chelp [him] to do better going forward.\u201d  Id. at 95\u2013\n96.  \n \nOn appeal, Esteras challenges his sentence on the ground that the district court relied on \nprohibited factors in sentencing him.  We disagree. \nCongress has authorized district courts to revoke supervised release.  See 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 3583(e).  In some settings, district courts have discretion to revoke, modify, or decrease a term \nof supervised release.  Id.  In other settings, as when a parolee possesses a weapon as Esteras did \nhere, the district court must revoke the individual\u2019s supervised release.  Id. \u00a7 3583(g).  Whether \nat the outset of sentencing an individual, in the context of a modified term of supervised release, \nor in the context of a required revocation of supervised release, Congress has directed courts to \nconsider certain factors.  In the words of Congress under the heading \u201cFactors to be considered \nin including a term of supervised release\u201d:  \u201cThe court . . . consider[s] the factors set forth in \nsection 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7).\u201d  Id. \n\u00a7 3583(c); see also id. \u00a7 3583(e) (similar for \u201cmodification of conditions or revocation\u201d of \nsupervised release).   \nAppendix B\n6a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 4 \n \nTo bring this provision into full view, here is a full recitation of \u00a7 3553(a) that italicizes \nthe factors that district courts need not consider in supervised-release determinations: \nThe court shall impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply \nwith the purposes set forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection. The court, in determining \nthe particular sentence to be imposed, shall consider\u2014 \n(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics \nof the defendant; \n(2) the need for the sentence imposed\u2014 \n(A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, \nand to provide just punishment for the offense; \n(B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; \n(C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and \n(D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational \ntraining, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective \nmanner; \n(3) the kinds of sentences available; \n(4) the kinds of sentence and the sentencing range established for\u2014 \n(A) the applicable category of offense committed by the applicable \ncategory of defendant as set forth in the guidelines\u2014 \n(i) issued by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to section \n994(a)(1) of title 28, United States Code, subject to any \namendments \nmade \nto \nsuch \nguidelines \nby \nact \nof Congress (regardless of whether such amendments have yet to \nbe incorporated by the Sentencing Commission into amendments \nissued under section 994(p) of title 28); and \n(ii) that, except as provided in section 3742(g), are in effect on the \ndate the defendant is sentenced; or \n(B) in the case of a violation of probation or supervised release, the \napplicable guidelines or policy statements issued by the Sentencing \nCommission pursuant to section 994(a)(3) of title 28, United States Code, \ntaking into account any amendments made to such guidelines or policy \nstatements by act of Congress (regardless of whether such amendments \nhave yet to be incorporated by the Sentencing Commission into \namendments issued under section 994(p) of title 28); \n(5) any pertinent policy statement\u2014 \n(A) issued by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to section 994(a)(2) of \ntitle 28, United States Code, subject to any amendments made to such \nAppendix B\n7a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 5 \n \npolicy statement by act of Congress (regardless of whether such \namendments have yet to be incorporated by the Sentencing Commission \ninto amendments issued under section 994(p) of title 28); and \n(B) that, except as provided in section 3742(g), is in effect on the date the \ndefendant is sentenced.  \n(6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with \nsimilar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct; and \n(7) the need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense. \n \nInvoking the italicized language, Esteras claims that \u00a7 3583(c) and (e) create a divide \nbetween permitted and forbidden supervised-release considerations.  As he sees it, a district court \njudge who considers the forbidden factors\u2014\u201cthe seriousness of the offense,\u201d \u201crespect for the \nlaw,\u201d \u201cjust punishment for the offense,\u201d or \u201cthe kinds of sentences available\u201d\u2014necessarily \nimposes a procedurally unreasonable sentence.  Notably, this argument applies to original \nsupervised-release decisions, which come immediately on the heels of any prison-sentence \ndetermination under all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(c), as well as to any \nrevocation, modification, or reduction determinations with respect to supervised release, see id. \n\u00a7 3583(e), (g). \nUnited States v. Lewis rejected this argument.  498 F.3d 393, 399\u2013400 (6th Cir. 2007).  It \nprovided two explanations:  one textual, one contextual.  Textually, Lewis observes that \u00a7 3583 \ngenerally gives courts considerable discretion over supervised-release decisions after considering \nthe listed factors.  Id. at 400.  It never says that the court may consider \u201conly\u201d those factors.  Id.  \nCongress, as it happens, knew how to instruct courts not to consider certain sentencing factors, as \nshown in its express command to disregard the goal of rehabilitation when imposing prison time.  \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(a) (\u201crecognizing that imprisonment is not an appropriate means of promoting \ncorrection or rehabilitation\u201d).   \nIn the context of supervised-release decisions, moreover, Lewis was concerned that this \nproposed bright-line rule was unworkable.  Whether in the context of an initial or later \nsupervised-release \ndecision, \nthe \npurportedly \nforbidden \nconsiderations \nmentioned \nin \n\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) tend to be \u201cessentially redundant\u201d with the permitted ones.  Lewis, 498 F.3d at \n400.  Take \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s consideration about the \u201cseriousness of the offense.\u201d  It aligns with \nAppendix B\n8a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 6 \n \n\u00a7 3553(a)(1) and its emphasis on \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense.\u201d  To think about \nthe one requires the judge to think about the other.   \nOr take \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s consideration of the need \u201cto promote respect for the law.\u201d  It \nmeshes with the rationale that revoking supervised release will \u201chelp\u201d the defendant \u201clearn to \nobey the conditions of his supervised release.\u201d  Id. (quoting Johnson v. United States, 529 U.S. \n694, 709 (2000)).  Indeed, in this case, Judge Pearson quite understandably could not see how \nshe could ignore respect for the law but consider a defendant\u2019s need to respect the terms of \nsupervised release.  To neglect the one dishonors the other. \nOr take \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s reference to \u201cjust punishment for the offense.\u201d  Under \n\u00a7 3553(a)(5), courts must consider \u201cany pertinent policy statement\u201d of the Sentencing \nCommission.  Among other guidance, the Commission tells judges to \u201csanction the violator for \nfailing to abide by the conditions of the court-ordered supervision.\u201d  Id. (quoting U.S.S.G. ch. 7 \npt. A \u00a7 3(b)).  The district court, in other words, must craft a remedy that corresponds to how \nseverely the defendant has breached the court\u2019s trust as \u201cembodied by the original sentence,\u201d \nwhich it cannot do without accounting for the conduct that violated supervised release.  United \nStates v. Johnson, 640 F.3d 195, 204 (6th Cir. 2011).  Another enumerated factor tells a court \nhow to carry out that analysis.  Under \u00a7 3553(a)(4)(B)\u2019s command to consult the Sentencing \nCommission\u2019s supervised-release guidelines, a court first classifies how \u201cserious\u201d these \nviolations are and then uses the categorization to determine the length of any prison sentence.  \nU.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 7B1.1, 7B1.3, 7B1.4. \nEsteras\u2019s bright-line rule is unworkable in another way.  Recall that Congress requires \ncourts to consider the same set of factors when first imposing a term of supervised release as \nwhen revoking one.  18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(c), (e).  Under Esteras\u2019s rule, if Congress forbade district \ncourts from considering anything related to \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) at a revocation hearing, it would not \npermit use of anything related to those factors at an initial sentencing either.  How would this \nwork?  Would the sentencing judge have to adjourn the hearing after imposing a sentence?  \nThen, would she have to start over with a new unblemished inquiry into the right term of \nsupervised release without any consideration, explicitly or implicitly, of considerations related \nto, say, the \u201crule of law\u201d?  Congress could not have expected courts to wipe their minds of these \nAppendix B\n9a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 7 \n \nconcerns when they move from one type of sentence to the other, and nothing in the statute \nrequires such compartmentalization.  If anything, the language points the other way.  It \nspecifically allows courts to account for the length of a supervised-release term \u201cin imposing a \nsentence to a term of imprisonment.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 3583(a).  \nEsteras\u2019s invocation of Tapia v. United States does not change matters.  564 U.S. 319 \n(2011).  It did not, most critically, arise under this statute.  The case dealt with a different \nsentencing law, one with explicit directions, not uncertain implications.  The statute in no \nuncertain \nterms \nsays \n\u201cthat \nimprisonment \nis \nnot \nan \nappropriate \nmeans \nof \npromoting . . . rehabilitation.\u201d  18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(a).  Consistent with that directive, Tapia ruled \nthat the statute precludes courts from considering \u201crehabilitation\u201d when imposing prison time.  \n\u201cOur consideration of Tapia\u2019s claim,\u201d it reasoned, \u201cstarts with the text of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(a)\u2014\nand given the clarity of that provision\u2019s language, could end there as well.\u201d  Tapia, 564 U.S. at \n326. \nIn the course of its analysis, it is true, the Court said in dicta that \u201ca court may not take \naccount of retribution\u201d when it \u201cimpos[es] a term of supervised release.\u201d  Id.  But even taken at \nface value, this reference does not undermine the district court\u2019s sentence.  The provision \nconfirms two things.  First, when the court imposes an initial supervised-release term, retribution \nshould not guide the decision.  No one has shown that Judge Pearson did anything of the sort at \nthat point\u2014and Esteras has not argued otherwise.  Second, if the defendant violates a term of \nsupervised release or commits a new crime, the government is put to a choice.  If it wishes to \nexact retribution for the new offense, new charges and the resulting process that comes with it \nare in order.  Otherwise, the district court should focus on non-retributive factors in deciding the \nnew sentence and the new term of supervised release.  But the district court in this instance did \nnot claim a right to exact retribution for this violation or for that matter use the word.  As shown, \nreferences to other concepts mentioned in \u00a7 3553(a)(2) are hopelessly over-inclusive, and mere \nreferences to things like the \u201crule of law\u201d\u2014or, worse, concepts that overlap with it\u2014do not \ncreate a procedurally unreasonable sentence absent evidence that the court was engaged in \nimposing a purely retributive sentence.  No such evidence exists here.  In fact, Tapia confirms \nthe point.  It ruled for the defendant only after observing that the court\u2019s \u201cnumber one thing \nAppendix B\n10a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 8 \n \n[was] the need to provide treatment\u201d and so may have increased the sentence to ensure Tapia \nwas \u201cin long enough to get the 500 Hour Drug Program.\u201d  Id. at 334 (quotations omitted).  \nThis understanding of \u00a7 3583(e) accords with the analysis of most other circuits and the \noutcomes of all of them.  The general rule is that courts may invoke factors related to the three \ngeneral considerations in \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) without creating a procedurally unreasonable sentence.  \nUnited States v. Vargas-Davila, 649 F.3d 129, 132 (1st Cir. 2011) (\u201cAlthough section 3583(e)(3) \nincorporates by reference, and thus encourages, consideration of certain enumerated subsections \nof section 3553(a), it does not forbid consideration of other pertinent section 3553(a) factors.\u201d); \nUnited States v. Williams, 443 F.3d 35, 48 (2d Cir. 2006) (\u201c[Section] 3583(e) cannot reasonably \nbe interpreted to exclude consideration of the seriousness of the releasee\u2019s violation, given the \nother factors that must be considered.\u201d); United States v. Young, 634 F.3d 233, 240 (3d Cir. \n2011) (\u201c[T]he mere omission of \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) from the mandatory supervised release \nrevocation considerations in \u00a7 3583(e) does not preclude a court from taking [the \n\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors] into account.  To hold otherwise would ignore the reality that the \nviolator\u2019s conduct simply cannot be disregarded in determining the appropriate sanction.\u201d); \nUnited States v. Webb, 738 F.3d 638, 642 (4th Cir. 2013) (\u201c[A]lthough a district court may not \nimpose a revocation sentence based predominantly on [the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors], we conclude \nthat mere reference to such considerations does not render a revocation sentence procedurally \nunreasonable when those factors are relevant to, and considered in conjunction with, the \nenumerated \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d); United States v. Clay, 752 F.3d 1106, 1108\u201309 (7th Cir. 2014) \n(\u201c[T]his subsection may be considered so long as the district court relies primarily on the factors \nlisted in \u00a7 3583(e) . . . .  [T]here is significant overlap between these factors and \n\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A).\u201d); see also United States v. King, 57 F.4th 1334, 1338 n.1 (11th Cir. 2023) \n(acknowledging language in prior cases permitting references to factors that also appear in \n\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)). \nEsteras\u2019s argument, notably, does not even work on its own terms\u2014at least the terms of \nthose circuits that support some of his reasoning.  The circuits that have described the \n\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors as impermissible when used punitively still recognize that they may play \nsupporting roles in a district court\u2019s analysis.  United States v. Sanchez, 900 F.3d 678, 684 n.5 \nAppendix B\n11a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 9 \n \n(5th Cir. 2018) (\u201c[T]his is not to say that any use of words like \u2018punish,\u2019 \u2018serious,\u2019 or \u2018respect\u2019 \nautomatically renders a revocation sentence void.  Mere mention of impermissible factors is \nacceptable; to constitute reversible error, our circuit has said, the forbidden factor must be \n\u2018dominant.\u2019\u201d); United States v. Porter, 974 F.3d 905, 907 (8th Cir. 2020) (\u201cAlthough we have \nlabeled \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) an improper, irrelevant, or \u2018excluded\u2019 factor, we have not declared its \nconsideration an error of law and therefore an abuse of discretion.\u201d); United States v. Simtob, \n485 F.3d 1058, 1063 (9th Cir. 2007) (\u201c[A] district court may properly look to and consider the \nconduct underlying the revocation as one of many acts contributing to the severity of the \nviolator\u2019s breach of trust so as not to preclude a full review of the violator\u2019s history and the \nviolator\u2019s likelihood of repeating that history.\u201d); United States v. Booker, 63 F.4th 1254, 1261\u2013\n62 (10th Cir. 2023) (rejecting the criminal defendant\u2019s appeal in a plain-error setting and noting \nthat it would be problematic to rely on a \u201cdirect quotation to [two] factors that may not be \nconsidered\u201d and as a result issue a \u201cretributive\u201d sentence).  Even under these decisions, Judge \nPearson acted properly when she considered the need to promote respect for \u201cthe rule of law\u201d \nalongside the enumerated \u00a7 3553(a) factors.  This \u201chighly relevant\u201d concern clearly speaks to the \nneed to deter Esteras\u2019s misconduct and protect the public from his disregard of the rule of law, to \nsay nothing of fulfilling the Sentencing Guideline\u2019s commentary on sanctioning Esteras for \nbreaching the court\u2019s trust.  Porter, 974 F.3d at 908\u201309.  All in all, it is highly doubtful that the \noutcome in this case would change under any other circuit\u2019s decision.   \nLast of all, Esteras is concerned that Judge Pearson used the word \u201cpunishment\u201d during \nthe hearing.  But this reference occurred at the beginning of the sentencing phase of the hearing \nand simply set the stage.  In her words, \u201cI find that the new law violation\u201d occurred and that she \nmay \u201cconsider\u201d \u201cevidence\u201d of it \u201cin the punishment I will issue today.\u201d  R.439 at 81.  This \nmanner of speaking at the beginning of a sentencing hearing does not remotely convey an intent \nto impose a retributive sentence in the context of a gun-possession violation that required \n\u201cpunishment\u201d\u2014the revocation of supervised release.  See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(g).  Likewise, when \nthe judge later used the word \u201cpunitive\u201d in describing the conditions of supervised release, R.439 \nat 95, it was to ensure that the sentence was not too long\u2014that the \u201cdeprivation of [Esteras\u2019s] \nliberty\u201d was \u201cno greater . . . than is reasonably necessary for the purposes set forth\u201d in the \nenumerated \u00a7 3553(a)(2) sections, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d)(2).  Surely, shorthand references to \nAppendix B\n12a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 10 \n\u201cpunitive\u201d or \u201cpunishment\u201d in the context of ensuring a sentence is not too long do not convey a \nforbidden focus on retribution.  \nWe AFFIRM the district court\u2019s revocation order. \nAppendix B\n13a\n\nPEARSON, J.\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nNORTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO\nEASTERN DIVISION\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\nPlaintiff,\nv.\nEDGARDO ESTERAS,\nDefendant.\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\nCASE NO.  4:14-CR-425-10\nJUDGE BENITA Y. PEARSON\nORDER\nOn September 6, 2018, Defendant Edgardo Esteras was sentenced to a 12-month term of\nincarceration as to Count 1 of the Indictment for conspiracy to distribute heroin, such term to be\nserved consecutively to the 15-month term of incarceration imposed for the probation violation in\nCase No. 4:11-CR-276-12-DAP, followed by a six-year term of supervised release, with standard\nand special conditions of supervision imposed.  Defendant was further ordered to pay a $100.00\nspecial assessment.  \nFollowing Defendant\u2019s term of incarceration, supervised release commenced on January\n10, 2020.\nOn or about February 20, 2020, the United States Probation Office (\u201cUSPO\u201d) submitted a\nSupervision Report to request a suspension of the GED condition:\nThis report serves to request a suspension of the General Education Diploma (GED)\ncondition.  Before incarceration, Mr. Esteras was diagnosed with an intellectual\ndevelopment disorder indicating difficulty with reading, writing, and comprehension. \nThe undersigned officer has had multiple conversations with Mr. Esteras regarding the\ncondition.  Mr. Esteras has expressed a willingness to work toward obtaining his GED,\nbut disclosed that he has tried and does not think he is capable of comprehending the\nmaterial.\nAppendix C\n14a\n\n(4:14-CR-425-10)\nOn July 20, 2020, the Court ordered suspension of the GED requirement under the\ncircumstances described.\nOn or about September 19, 2022, the USPO issued a Supervision Report to relay a\nrequest from Defendant for early termination of his term of supervised release.  \nOn September 21, 2022, the Court denied Defendant\u2019s request for early termination of\nsupervised release, without prejudice to another request being considered at a later time.\nOn or about January 23, 2023, the USPO issued a Violation Report to notify the Court of\nDefendant\u2019s violation of the terms and conditions of his supervised release:\n-New Criminal Charges (filing is pending with Youngstown Municipal Court)\n-Violent Conduct\n-Whereabouts Unknown (Absconder)\nOn January 23, 2023, at 0003 hours, Officers with the Youngstown Police Department\nwere dispatched to 1137 Inverness Avenue in Youngstown in reference to gunfire.  Upon\narrival, contact was made with the victim, who advised the father of her children,\nEdgardo Esteras, had physically assaulted her and threatened to kill her.  At\napproximately 2350 hours, Mr. Esteras stormed into the residence, struck the victim in\nthe head, punched a television set, and then stormed outside of the residence.  The victim\nfollowed Mr. Edgardo out of the residence who was now inside a vehicle.  The victim\nreached inside the vehicle to grab Mr. Esteras car keys, at which time he produced a\nhandgun and pointed it at the victim and stated, \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you\u201d.  At this time, the\nvictim retreated inside the residence at which time Mr. Esteras fired three rounds into her\nvehicle, an Infiniti JX35, which was located in the driveway of the residence.  Mr. Esteras\nthen fled the scene in a Black Chevy Blazer with an unknown registration. \nOfficers recovered spent 9mm shell casings and observed three bullet holes in the side of\nMI\u2019s vehicle, as well as a broken television set.  The victim refused medical treatment but\ndid advise she wished to file charges of domestic violence against Mr. Esteras.  The\nvictim further advised that Mr. Esteras frequently assaults her, and she has had enough. \nThe Youngstown Police Department is currently pursuing charges of Domestic Violence,\nIllegal Discharge of a Firearm, and Vehicular Vandalism. Formal charges have not been\nofficially filed and Mr. Esteras remains at large as of the time of this report.\nOn January 23, 2023, the Court ordered the issuance of a Warrant for Defendant\u2019s arrest.\n2\nAppendix C\n15a\n\n(4:14-CR-425-10)\nOn or about January 30, 2023, the USPO issued a Follow Up Violation Report to provide\nan update to the Court on Defendant\u2019s violations:\n1.\nNew Law Violation:  On January 23, 2023, Mr. Esteras was charged with\nDomestic Violence (M1), Aggravated Menacing (M1), and Criminal\nDamaging/Endangering (M2) in the Youngstown Municipal Court under case\nnumber 2023CRB00121. \n2.\nPossession of a Firearm:  On January 23, 2023, Mr. Esteras did have in his\npossession or under his control a firearm. \nDefendant was arrested and appeared before Magistrate Judge Amanda M. Knapp on\nJanuary 31, 2023 for an initial appearance.  On February 6, 2023, Magistrate Judge Knapp\nconducted preliminary and detention hearings.  The Court found that probable cause existed for\nthe violations, and additional proceedings would be conducted by the undersigned.  Defendant\nwas remanded to the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service.\nOn or about March 14, 2023, the USPO issued a Supplemental Information Report to\nprovide an update to the Court regarding the status of Defendant\u2019s state charges:\nOn January 22, 2023, Mr. Esteras was charged with Domestic Violence (M1), Aggravated\nMenacing (M1), and Criminal Damaging (M2) in the Youngstown Municipal Court under\ncase number 2023CRB00121Y.  On February 22, 2023, all charges were dismissed at\nrequest of the victim.\nOn April 18, 2023, the Court conducted a Supervised Release Violation Hearing and \nSentencing, at which time Defendant denied Violation Numbers 1 and 2.  Officer Robert\nDiMaiolo testified on direct examination by the Government, with cross examination by the\ndefense.  The Government played a bodycam video (Exhibit 5) of the victim and her family\u2019s\nearly morning interactions with law enforcement officers shortly after the above referenced\n3\nAppendix C\n16a\n\n(4:14-CR-425-10)\ncrimes occurred.1  During those recorded interactions, no one indicated a perpetrator other than\nDefendant.  The alleged victim testified that, after that early morning interaction with law\nenforcement, she went to municipal court and reported Defendant as the perpetrator of the\ncrimes.  Despite the strong evidence against Defendant, the victim attempted (unpersuasively) to\nrecant, when examined on direct examination by defense counsel.  The  Government effectively\ncross examined the victim and submitted Government\u2019s Exhibits 1 through 5, which were\nadmitted without objection.  The Court found by a preponderance of the evidence that Defendant\npossessed a firearm, in violation of the terms of his supervised release, sustaining Violation No.\n2.  The Court proceeded to pronounce sentence after allocution. \nSentencing\nAmong other things, the Court has considered the evidence presented at the violation\nhearing, statutory maximum penalties pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3); the advisory policy\nstatements set forth in Chapter Seven of the United States Sentencing Guidelines; and the\nsuggested range of incarceration pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a).  Furthermore, the Court has\nconsidered the factors and conditions for sentencing listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and 3583(d),\nrespectively.\nBased upon the Court\u2019s review and for the reasons set forth on the record, Defendant\u2019s\nterm of supervised release is revoked.

Esteras \nPage 3 \n \n____________________ \nDISSENT \n____________________ \nKAREN NELSON MOORE, Circuit Judge, dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc.1  \nThe top line of any sentence is generally the term of incarceration.  What catches the eye is how \nlong the defendant will be in prison, not how long the defendant will remain under court \nsupervision.  But in the federal system, supervised release\u2014the often years\u2019 long period of court \nsupervision and restrictions following incarceration\u2014comes with the specter of more time in a \ncell.  Judges may \u201crevoke\u201d a defendant\u2019s supervised release if a defendant violates court-ordered \nconditions, sending the defendant back to prison for months or possibly years.  After Edgardo \nEsteras spent twelve months in federal prison on his original term of incarceration, the judge in \nhis case sentenced him to 24 more months in prison\u2014double his original sentence\u2014for violating \nconditions of supervised release.  R. 439 (Revocation Tr. at 85:13\u201321) (Page ID #2887). \nRevocation of supervised release is immensely impactful, and sometimes carries \nconsequences even greater than an original term of incarceration.  In sentencing Esteras after \nrevoking his supervised release, the district court focused on the retributive purpose of the \nadditional term of incarceration.  See, e.g., id. at 81:17\u201322 (Page ID #2883) (explaining what \ninformation can be considered \u201cin the punishment I will issue today\u201d (emphasis added)); id. at \n83:9\u201311 (Page ID #2885) (\u201c[W]hat\u2019s been done before isn\u2019t sufficient enough to deter you, to \nencourage you to be respectful of the law, to be law-abiding.\u201d (emphasis added)).  But the \nsupervised-release statute tells district courts not to consider punishment as a purpose when \nimposing or revoking supervised release.  When defense counsel objected to the district court\u2019s \n \n1The court received a petition for rehearing en banc concerning the original order in this case, which \nfollowed binding Sixth Circuit precedent.  The petition for rehearing en banc was circulated to the entire court, and \nless than a majority of the judges voted in favor of rehearing the original order en banc.  Following circulation to the \nfull court of the en banc petition, however, the panel revised its prior order and circulated it to the en banc court.  En \nbanc rehearing of the prior order was warranted, which is why I dissent from denial of rehearing en banc.  And en \nbanc rehearing remains warranted now that the panel is issuing an amended order, because that revised decision \nlikewise relies on the same mistaken precedent.  Because both the original and revised orders rely on United States \nv. Lewis, 498 F.3d 393 (6th Cir. 2007), I have addressed both in this dissent from denial of rehearing en banc.  \nEsteras is of course free to petition for en banc rehearing again, now that the panel has filed a revised and published \ndecision. \nAppendix D\n21a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 4 \n \nimpermissible consideration of certain statutory factors embodying retributive purposes, the \ndistrict court confirmed that it relied heavily on \u201cpromot[ing] respect for the law\u201d in reaching its \nsentence, which represented an upward variance.  Id. at 92:16\u201318 (Page ID #2894).  In effect, \nthere is a real chance that Esteras was essentially punished twice, raising concerns of a \nconstitutional dimension and flagrantly violating Congress\u2019s intent in any event.  Our precedent \nthat allows district courts to consider unenumerated sentencing factors when revoking supervised \nrelease, United States v. Lewis, 498 F.3d 393 (6th Cir. 2007), relies on atextual reasoning directly \ncontrary to Congress\u2019s purposes.  It is an outlier among the circuits.  Our failure today to correct \nLewis\u2019s basic mistakes usurps Congress\u2019s role, runs afoul of rudimentary principles of statutory \ninterpretation, and ultimately undermines the purposes of supervised release.  Today\u2019s decision \nin this case serves only to prolong our unfortunate adherence to a mistaken precedent. \nToday\u2019s opinion defends Lewis on two grounds:  \u201cone textual, [and] one contextual.\u201d  \nAmended Order at 5.  Neither ground supports Lewis or today\u2019s decision.  The statutory text is \nclear.  It directs district judges to take account of certain sentencing factors, but not others, when \nrevoking supervised release.  Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e), a court \u201cmay, after considering the \nfactors set forth in section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and \n(a)(7),\u201d terminate, modify, extend, or revoke a defendant\u2019s term of supervised release.  Notably \nabsent from this list is \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), which directs district courts to consider \u201cthe need for the \nsentence imposed . . . to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and \nto provide just punishment for the offense.\u201d  Canons of statutory construction dictate that this \nomission was intentional and command district courts not to take account of the (a)(2)(A) factors \nwhen revoking supervised release.  See, e.g., Leatherman v. Tarrant Cnty. Narcotics Intel. & \nCoordination Unit, 507 U.S. 163, 168 (1993) (declining to extend Rule 9(b)\u2019s pleading \nrequirements to complaints alleging municipal liability because \u201cthe Federal Rules do address in \nRule 9(b) the question of the need for greater particularity in pleading certain actions, but do not \ninclude among the enumerated actions any reference to complaints alleging municipal liability\u201d); \nid. (\u201cExpressio unius est exclusio alterius.\u201d); Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983) \n(\u201c[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in \nanother section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and \nAppendix D\n22a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 5 \n \npurposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\u201d (quoting United States v. Wong Kim Bo, \n472 F.2d 720, 722 (5th Cir. 1972))). \nSimply put, Lewis and today\u2019s opinion offer no explanation for why Congress \ndeliberately chose to include some, but not all, of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in \u00a7 3583(e).  Today\u2019s \nopinion declares that \u00a7 3583 \u201cgenerally gives courts considerable discretion over supervised- \nrelease decisions after considering the listed factors.\u201d  Amended Order at 5 (citing Lewis, \n498 F.3d at 400).  But neither Lewis nor the instant opinion can ground this contention in the \nstatutory text.  Rather, \u00a7 3583(e) explicitly constrains the exercise of discretion, directing district \ncourts to focus on only the enumerated factors.  Had Congress wished for district courts to \nconsider the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors, it would have made \u00a7 3583(e) coterminous with \u00a7 3553(a).  \nCongress did not.  See Azar v. Allina Health Servs., 587 U.S. ----, 139 S. Ct. 1804, 1813 (2019) \n(explaining that courts should not rely on the \u201cdoubtful proposition that Congress sought to \naccomplish in a \u2018surpassingly strange manner\u2019 what it could have accomplished in a much more \nstraightforward way\u201d (quoting RadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC v. Amalgamated Bank, 566 U.S. \n639, 647 (2012))). \nThe context follows from the text.  In Tapia v. United States, the Supreme Court \nexplained that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2013(D) reflects \u201cthe four purposes of sentencing \ngenerally\u201d:  \u201cretribution, deterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation.\u201d  564 U.S. 319, 325 \n(2011).  The statute\u2019s \u201cprovisions make clear that a particular purpose may apply differently, or \neven not at all, depending on the kind of sentence under consideration.\u201d  Id. at 326.  Following \nthe statute\u2019s plain text, \u201ca court may not take account of retribution (the first purpose listed in \n\u00a7 3553(a)(2)) when imposing a term of supervised release.\u201d  Id.  Section \u00a7 3583(e), which \npertains to revoking supervised release, is the mirror-image of \u00a7 3583(c), which pertains to \nimposing a term of supervised release.  It follows that both subsections direct district courts not \nto consider retribution when imposing or revoking supervised release. \nFaced with this obvious hurdle, today\u2019s decision attempts to rewrite Tapia.  Of course, \nI need not put much gloss on what Justice Kagan straightforwardly said in that opinion:  a district \ncourt cannot rely on the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors when making decisions concerning supervised \nrelease.  Tapia, 564 U.S. at 326.  Today\u2019s decision attempts to skirt this plain statement through \nAppendix D\n23a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 6 \n \ntwo paragraphs of explanation of what Justice Kagan supposedly must have meant.  I, like \nJustice Kagan, prefer to rely on the actual text of the statute.  In any event, today\u2019s attempt to \nsquare what the district court did with Tapia is futile.  For one, today\u2019s opinion gets its facts \nwrong.  It says in conclusory words that no one has shown that the district judge let retribution \nguide the decision.  Amended Order at 7.  Most obviously, Esteras has.  Pet. Rehearing En Banc \nat 10 (\u201cThe district court expressly relied on the section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors\u2014specifically, the \nneed to punish and to promote respect for the law\u2014when revoking Esteras\u2019 supervised release.\u201d \n(emphasis added)).  And this assertion of the panel is belied by the plain words the district court \nused in the proceeding, which sounded in retribution.  Like its take on Tapia, today\u2019s decision \nwould rather reconceptualize the very words the district court used\u2014\u201cpunishment\u201d and \n\u201cpunitive\u201d\u2014and chalk them up to \u201cset[ting] the stage\u201d rather than an error on the part of the \ndistrict court.  Of course, \u201csetting the stage\u201d by thinking of the sentence in terms of punishment \nis precisely what a district court must not do per the text of the statute.  To the extent that Tapia \nexplains that taking the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors into account necessarily means taking retribution \ninto account, today\u2019s decision\u2019s myopic focus on a word here or there entirely misses the point. \nTapia is also instructive on statute-drafting more broadly.  But once again, today\u2019s \ndecision would rather ignore its clear import.  Today\u2019s decision suggests that unless Congress \nenacts a separate statutory provision forbidding district courts to take account of certain factors, \nas it did in \u00a7 3582(a), the purposeful omissions in \u00a7 3583(c) and (e) are meaningless.  Yet \nCongress can accomplish its statutory purposes in a variety of ways, as Tapia recognizes.  Again, \nthe only understanding of \u00a7 3583(e) that gives effect to its plain text is that explained by Tapia. \nThat retributive concerns are not to be taken into account reflects Congress\u2019s judgment of \nthe purpose of supervised release.  The relevant legislative history explicitly states that \u201cthe \nsentencing purposes of incapacitation and punishment would not be served by a term of \nsupervised release\u2014that the primary goal of such a term is to ease the defendant\u2019s transition into \nthe community.\u201d  S. Rep. No. 98-225, at *124 (1983); see also Johnson v. United States, \n529 U.S. 694, 708\u201309 (2000) (citing the Senate Report and discussing the purpose of supervised \nrelease).  By contrast, taking the retributive \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors into account when imposing \nor revoking supervised release contravenes this congressional purpose and also creates \u201cserious \nAppendix D\n24a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 7 \n \nconstitutional questions . . . by construing revocation and reimprisonment as punishment for the \nviolation of the conditions of supervised release.\u201d  Johnson, 529 U.S. at 700.  The Sentencing \nGuidelines confirm this understanding:  revocation of supervised release is not meant to \n\u201csubstantially duplicate the sanctioning role of the court with jurisdiction over a defendant\u2019s new \ncriminal conduct,\u201d but instead to \u201csanction primarily the defendant\u2019s breach of trust.\u201d  U.S. \nSent\u2019g Guidelines Manual Ch. 7A Intro. (U.S. Sent\u2019g Comm\u2019n 2023). \nNo doubt, there is some level of overlap between the factors district courts must consider \nwhen revoking supervised release, and those that a district court cannot consider.  See Lewis, 498 \nF. 3d at 400 (explaining that a district court likely takes into account the seriousness of an \noffense when considering the nature and circumstances of the offense).  But today\u2019s opinion \ntreats this reality\u2014that there is some degree of overlap\u2014as a virtue, manifestly dishonoring \nCongress\u2019s decision to omit the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors from consideration.  Amended Order at \n6 (\u201cTo think about the one requires the judge to think about the other.\u201d); id. (\u201cTo neglect the one \ndishonors the other.\u201d).  That a district court may consider, to some degree, the seriousness of the \noffense, however, does not justify allowing district courts to disregard Congress\u2019s mandate that \nretributive concerns should not influence the overall sentence.  Put differently, the overlap \nproblem first identified by Lewis is exaggerated to the extent that a district court can avoid \nrunning afoul of the statute by avoiding viewing revocation of supervised release as retribution. \nPerhaps recognizing the futility of any text-based argument, today\u2019s decision reinvents \nthe overlap argument in the form of a strawman.  It suggests that Congress cannot possibly have \nmeant that district courts should not rely on the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors when revoking \nsupervised release, because \u201cCongress requires courts to consider the same set of factors when \nfirst imposing a term of supervised release as when revoking one.\u201d  Amended Order at 6.  Per \ntoday\u2019s decision, district courts would be forced to \u201cadjourn the hearing after imposing a[n] \n[initial] sentence\u201d and \u201cstart over with a new unblemished inquiry into the right term of \nsupervised release\u201d so as to not mistakenly consider the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors.  Id.  This \nargument is disingenuous.  What the statute requires is that district courts not view supervised \nrelease as an additional punishment, and that district courts adjust their rationale and \nAppendix D\n25a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 8 \n \nconsiderations accordingly when imposing or revoking supervised release.  The district court \nmanifestly failed to do that here. \nWhat is more, some degree of overlap cannot explain away Congress\u2019s explicit choice to \nomit certain sentencing factors from consideration when revoking supervised release.  In this \nway, the analyses of Lewis and today\u2019s opinion are self-defeating.  If Congress believed that \ncourts would inevitably consider the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors when revoking supervised release, \nit would not have omitted such factors from \u00a7 3583.  Lewis, 498 F.3d at 400.  The same is true if \nCongress affirmatively wanted district courts to consider such factors.  Id. at 399\u2013400.  \nRegardless, bare judicial pragmatism cannot overcome the plain text of the statute, which directs \ndistrict courts not to take retributive sentencing factors into account.  United States v. Tohono \nO\u2019Odham Nation, 563 U.S. 307, 317 (2011) (\u201c[C]onsiderations of policy divorced from the \nstatute\u2019s text and purpose could not override its meaning.\u201d). \nBeyond these fundamental errors, en banc reconsideration is warranted because the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s approach is an outlier among the circuit courts.  Lewis and today\u2019s opinion are entirely \nuntethered from the statutory text, and it would appear that they allow a district court to rely \nexclusively on the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors when revoking supervised release.  Lewis, 498 F.3d at \n399\u2013400 (holding \u201cthat it does not constitute reversible error to consider \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) when \nimposing a sentence for violation of supervised release, even though this factor is not \nenumerated in \u00a7 3583(e)\u201d).  In other words, our cases contain no limits and allow district courts \nto disregard \u00a7 3583(e) in toto.  Though there is a circuit split on this issue, most circuits would \nfind that a revocation of supervised release principally based on the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors is \nprocedurally unreasonable.  See, e.g., United States v. Booker, 63 F.4th 1254, 1260 (10th Cir. \n2023) (\u201c[I]t is procedural error to consider an unenumerated [\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)] factor.\u201d); United \nStates v. Miqbel, 444 F.3d 1173, 1182\u201383 (9th Cir. 2006) (holding that \u201cmere reference\u201d to \nunenumerated \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors would not be reversible error, but that further \nconsideration of such factors when revoking supervised release is procedurally unreasonable); \nUnited States v. Rivera, 784 F.3d 1012, 1017 (5th Cir. 2015) (\u201c[A] sentencing error occurs when \nan impermissible consideration is a dominant factor in the court\u2019s revocation sentence.\u201d); United \nStates v. Young, 634 F.3d 233, 241 (3rd Cir. 2011) (recognizing that consideration of \nAppendix D\n26a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 9 \n \nunenumerated \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors would not be reversible per se error, but that \u201cthere may \nbe a case where a court places undue weight on the\u201d \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors); United States v. \nWebb, 738 F.3d 638, 642 (4th Cir. 2013) (\u201c[A]lthough a district court may not impose a \nrevocation sentence based predominately on the [\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors], we conclude that \nmere reference to such considerations does not render a revocation sentence procedurally \nunreasonable.\u201d); United States v. Clay, 752 F.3d 1106, 1108 (7th Cir. 2014) (\u201c[W]e now join the \nmajority of circuits that have faced this issue and rule that this subsection [\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)] may \nbe considered so long as the district court relies primarily on [enumerated] factors.\u201d (emphasis \nadded)).  Lewis appears expressly to adopt punishment as a valid rationale for revoking \nsupervised release, directly contrary to the statute and Congress\u2019s intent.  498 F.3d at 400 \n(\u201c[A]lthough violations of supervised release generally do not entail conduct as serious as crimes \npunishable under the \u00a7 3553(a) regime, revocation sentences are similarly intended to \u2018sanction,\u2019 \nor, analogously, to \u2018provide just punishment for the offense\u2019 of violating supervised release.\u201d). \nLewis and today\u2019s decision bulldoze over each and every indication of congressional \nintent available in favor of an explicitly policy-driven outcome.  That includes plain text, \nlegislative history, and information from the Sentencing Commission.  \u201c[D]eference to the \nsupremacy of the Legislature, as well as recognition that Congress[members] typically vote on \nthe language of a bill, generally requires us to assume that \u2018the legislative purpose is expressed \nby the ordinary meaning of the words used.\u2019\u201d  United States v. Locke, 471 U.S. 84, 95 (1985) \n(quoting Richards v. United States, 369 U.S. 1, 9 (1962)).  Here, this deference requires that \ndistrict courts honor Congress\u2019s explicit choice that supervised release not be an additional \npunishment, and that district courts adjust their rationale and considerations accordingly.  The \ndistrict court failed to do that here.  It plainly viewed revocation of supervised release as \npunishment, and sentenced Esteras to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment based on impermissible \nsentencing factors.

Because our precedent mistakenly allows a district court to do so, I respectfully \ndissent from the denial of rehearing en banc in this case. \n \n \nAppendix D\n27a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v.

The original panel has reviewed the \npetition for rehearing and concludes that the issues raised in the petition were fully considered \nupon the original submission and decision.  The petition then was circulated to the full court.  \nLess than a majority of the judges voted in favor of rehearing en banc. \n \nTherefore, the petition is denied. \n \n \nAppendix E\n31a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v.

United States v. Esteras, 88 F.4th 1170, 1171\u201376 (6th Cir. 2023) \n(Moore, J., dissenting).  I would grant the current petition for rehearing because United States v. \nLewis, 498 F.3d 393 (6th Cir. 2007), and the amended panel order in this case contravene the \nstatutory text, disregard Supreme Court precedent, and place the Sixth Circuit at the extreme of a \ncircuit split, allowing our district courts expressly to punish defendants for violations of \nsupervised release.  Esteras, 88 F.4th at 1171\u201375 (Moore, J., dissenting).  Judge Griffin rightly \nflags the severe consequences that our precedents create for the hundreds of individuals who face \nrevocations of supervised release each year, and correctly points out that these consequences and \nthe shaky foundation of our precedents mean that Esteras\u2019s petition raises questions of \nexceptional importance.  En banc rehearing remains warranted for all of these reasons. \n \n \nAppendix E\n32a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v.

UPHOLD, RDR, CRR         (330) 884-7424\n81\nchange her story.  But only enough to make her appear \nconfused.  Nothing she said that was of significance while \nunder oath persuades me to believe that you did not possess \nthe weapon, that you did not point it at that household, \nthat you did not discharge it at least three times.  \nNow, regarding the new law violation, I wish I \nwere better versed in the ordinances, regulations, the \nactual law of Youngstown, knowing its elements.  I suspect \nthat your behavior at targeting the house with a weapon and \nactually assaulting the car with at least three bullets, the \ncasing of one which was found in the driveway, match the \nelements.  But I just don't know.  And it really doesn't \nmatter.  Because as I told counsel at the beginning of the \nhearing, both are Grade C violations.  You are subject to \nthe same penalties regardless of whether I find that you \nviolated your term of supervised release in one or two ways.  \nSo I find that the new law violation and \nMs. Infante's corroboration of it by presenting herself at \nYoungstown Municipal Court the next day is evidence that I \ncan consider in the punishment I will issue today.  But I \nfind explicitly that you violated your term of supervision \nby possessing a weapon.  \nI will allow you to allocute now, and then I will \nrespond by imposing consequences.  You have the opportunity \nto speak if you would like to be heard. \nAppendix F\n37a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n17:09:53\n17:10:06\n17:10:33\n17:10:47\n17:11:06\nMARY L. UPHOLD, RDR, CRR         (330) 884-7424\n82\n(Discussion held off the record between the defendant \nand Mr. Grostic.)  \nTHE DEFENDANT:  I really ain't got -- I ain't got \nthat much to say.  If -- it's -- I don't.  \nTHE COURT:  You choose not to allocute?\nTHE DEFENDANT:  What can I say if you -- I just \ndon't.  \nMR. GROSTIC:  Okay.  If I could have one moment, \nYour Honor.  \nTHE COURT:  Certainly. \n(Discussion held off the record between the defendant \nand Mr. Grostic.)  \nMR. GROSTIC:  Your Honor, after discussion, which \nI appreciate the Court's indulging me, Mr. Esteras has \nconfirmed with me that he does not want to say anything \nfurther. \nTHE COURT:  Certainly.  \nThat's fine, Mr. Esteras.  You've been before a \nfederal judge at least three times facing a sentencing.  The \nfirst time was my colleague, Judge Polster.  The last time \nwas me.  This time is also me meting out a sentence.  \nSo I understand that you understand the right you \nhave and the right you give up.  You have been under a term \nof supervised release at least twice.  When I imposed \nsentence upon you the last time, I sentenced you for the \nAppendix F\n38a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n17:11:25\n17:11:45\n17:11:59\n17:12:20\n17:12:34\nMARY L. UPHOLD, RDR, CRR         (330) 884-7424\n83\ncommission of the crime that was on my docket, conspiracy to \ndistribute heroin, and I also sentenced you for the \nviolation of the earlier term of supervision imposed that \nyou were under when you were indicted in the new case then \non my docket, and that was possession with intent -- \nconspiracy to possess with intent cocaine and cocaine base.  \nSo you are no stranger to law violations and no \nstranger to federal court.  My worry for you, sir, is that \nwhat's been done before isn't sufficient enough to deter \nyou, to encourage you to be respectful of the law, to be \nlaw-abiding.  \nEven things I heard in the video that were \nrepeated today, it appears that you assault that household \nregularly.  That you argue in a violent way with Ms. Infante \nregularly.  I am not really sure what it will require for \nyou to learn that enough is enough.  You were given \nprobation by Judge Polster.  I imposed two rather lenient \nsentences, 15 months on that term of supervision violation \nfor Judge Polster; for my own case, 12 months.  I ran them \nconsecutively.  I thought 27 months might encourage you to \ndo better.  \nIt was with some reluctance, a great deal \nactually, that I even suspended the GED qualification, \nthinking that perhaps if you were to become better educated, \nprove to yourself and others that you can read and write at \nAppendix F\n39a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n17:12:49\n17:13:10\n17:13:26\n17:13:45\n17:14:00\nMARY L. UPHOLD, RDR, CRR         (330) 884-7424\n84\nat least a high school level, you might begin to see \nyourself as something other than a law violator, someone who \nhits women, someone who disturbs children in the middle of \nthe night.  \nMy reading of the police report is that Officer \nDiMaiolo was at that household at about 3:28 a.m. on a \nschool night.  Late January.  Vacation is over.  There were \nschool-aged persons in that video, and yet they were \nawake -- not all of them were school-aged, of course -- \nbecause you had assaulted the car and the household with \nyour intentions and broken the TV.  \nOne of the youngsters said, \"I was scared.  Now I \ncan't watch TV.\"  That might seem insignificant to you, but \nchildren shouldn't grow up afraid of what their father or \ntheir mother's boyfriend might do to them at night.  \nWhen I consider the guidance given to us by \nOfficer Zakrajsek that I've confirmed with you, is not \nobjected to, and in my opinion is correct, you are subject, \npursuant to the advisory guidelines, to 6 to 12 months.  We \nknow that your offense that's brought you here on my docket \ncarries a lifetime of supervision.  \nHaving found that you are in violation of that \nterm of supervised release by the preponderance of the \nevidence, I must escalate the consequences imposed.  And I \ndo here impose escalated consequences by exercising my \nAppendix F\n40a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n17:14:21\n17:14:38\n17:14:54\n17:15:15\n17:15:31\nMARY L. UPHOLD, RDR, CRR         (330) 884-7424\n85\ndiscretion to vary upwards, above even the high end of the \nadvisory guidelines, because your behavior is not average, \nit's not typical, it's not mine run, it's exceptional.  It's \ndisrespectful.  It's dangerous.  And it must stop.  \nAnd if you cannot stop yourself, I will separate \nyou from society for long enough to at least allow you to \nreconsider your behavior.  And hopefully when you return \nunder the new term of supervision that I will impose, you \nwill do better.  You will think before you act.  And you \nwill understand that never possessing a weapon or dangerous \ndevice or a single bullet is meant for you for the rest of \nyour natural life.  \nPlease listen as I formally impose consequences.  \nI revoke your term of supervised release.  I \nhereby impose a term of incarceration of 24 months.  A new \nterm of supervised release of three years.  Every term of \nsupervised release that I imposed earlier, the last time I \nsentenced you in September of 2018, is reimposed unless it's \nbeen met.  For instance, I don't require you to obtain a GED \nagain.  If you've paid your special assessment, that's \nsatisfied.  \nBut every other term, including substance abuse \ntreatment and testing, a search and seizure provision, \nmental health treatment are the ones I am listing simply \nbecause I believe they have likely not been met.  And if -- \nAppendix F\n41a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n17:15:48\n17:16:01\n17:16:17\n17:16:34\n17:16:44\nMARY L. UPHOLD, RDR, CRR         (330) 884-7424\n86\nI mean, likely are those that are capable of being repeated \nand shall be repeated.  \nAnd I am adding a new one.  I am adding, for the \nfirst six months of your release -- keep in mind, I can \nincarcerate you for up to three years.  I have stopped at 24 \nmonths.  But once you're released to start this new \nthree-year term of supervised release, for the first six \nmonths, you are going to be on location monitoring with a \ncurfew.  \nMr. Zakrajsek, Mr. Esteras goes nowhere without \nthe explicit permission of his supervising probation \nofficer.  He shall only live at a place approved by the \nprobation office.  Make sure there are no weapons there.  If \nhe's unable to find such a place, then he'll start his term \nof release by living in a residential reentry center until \nhe has enough money to pay his own rent and live in a place \nthat is suitable.  \nI order that this curfew allow him to work, to \nattend to medical appointments as necessary, and to only be \nin the presence of the victim and the minor children who \nlive with him with the permission of the supervising \nprobation officer.  \nIs all of that clear, Mr. Esteras?\nTHE DEFENDANT:  Yes, Your Honor.  \nTHE COURT:  Sir, I have revoked your term of \nAppendix F\n42a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n17:17:00\n17:17:13\n17:17:22\n17:17:39\n17:17:54\nMARY L. UPHOLD, RDR, CRR         (330) 884-7424\n87\nsupervised release.  You have a new term -- a new ability to \nappeal the sentence that I have imposed.  There is still the \nlimit.  You've heard this before.  It remains 14 days from \nthe date on which I reduce to writing the sentence I've \nimposed.  If you allow that 14-day period to go by without \nfiling a notice of appeal, you may have forever waived your \nappellate rights.  \nMr. Grostic, will you speak with your client about \nhis appellate rights?  \nMR. GROSTIC:  Yes, Your Honor. \nTHE COURT:  Should he ask you to do so, will you \ntimely file a notice of appeal for him?  \nMR. GROSTIC:  Yes, Your Honor. \nTHE COURT:  You should know, Mr. Esteras, as you \nlikely do, if you cannot afford counsel, just like you do \nnot pay Mr. Grostic or his office, counsel will be appointed \nto represent you free of charge.  So that should not be the \nreason you don't timely file a notice of appeal.  \nDo you understand that?\nTHE DEFENDANT:  (Nodding head up and down.) \nYes, Your Honor. \nTHE COURT:  Mr. Zakrajsek, you have heard me \nreimpose conditions that are obviously not completed and are \ncapable of being repeated, and I believe will be of \nassistance to Mr. Esteras when he returns to the community.  \nAppendix F\n43a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n17:18:05\n17:18:19\n17:18:35\n17:18:55\n17:19:04\nMARY L. UPHOLD, RDR, CRR         (330) 884-7424\n88\nAnd I have added six months of location monitoring with a \ncurfew.  \nIs there anything else you'd like me to consider \nat this time?  \nOFFICER ZAKRAJSEK:  Your Honor, I would like to \npetition the Court to consider possibly an anger management \nprogram as well due to his anger issues.  \nTHE COURT:  Thank you.  I think that's an \nexcellent suggestion.  \nSo in the past, Mr. Esteras, I have ordered that \nyou be subjected to mental health treatment.  I am ordering \nthat again.  It will start with an evaluation.  Part of the \ntreatment you'll undergo after that evaluation will be anger \nmanagement.  \nIf you do behave in the way that the violation \nthat's brought you to court seems to indicate is a regular \noccurrence, you must learn to control yourself or you are \nlikely going to do something that is going to separate you \nfrom society for a much longer period than just 24 months.  \nSo I do impose, as a component of mental health, \nanger management.  \nWhat else, Mr. Zakrajsek?  \nOFFICER ZAKRAJSEK:  Nothing further, Your Honor.  \nThank you.  \nTHE COURT:  Thank you for your work in this case.  \nAppendix F\n44a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n17:19:23\n17:19:35\n17:19:52\n17:20:04\n17:20:19\nMARY L.

JOYCE:  Your Honor, I believe the conditions \nthat you have outlined here, with the addition from -- the \nadditional recommend by Mr. Zakrajsek are appropriate, and I \nwould offer nothing additional.  Thank you.  \nTHE COURT:  Your objection to the sentence \nimposed, Government's Counsel.  \nMR. JOYCE:  I have no objection, Your Honor.  \nTHE COURT:  Mr. Grostic, why don't I start by \nasking you what you think I can do to improve the conditions \nof supervised release.  Of course, all of the mandatory, \nstandard, and the conditions I've just outlined are those \nthat fall under special conditions.  \nMR. GROSTIC:  (Nodding head up and down.)  \nTHE COURT:  Thank you for nodding that you \nunderstood that.  If there are any others that you believe I \nshould impose that will assist your client or impose in a \ndifferent way, like Mr. Zakrajsek suggested regarding \nrefining mental health, it's not limited to anger \nmanagement, but that's now a specific component, is there \nanything else you'd suggest?  \nMR. GROSTIC:  I don't believe so, Your Honor, as \nfar as conditions of supervised release.  \nAppendix F\n45a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n17:20:32\n17:20:43\n17:21:01\n17:21:14\n17:21:20\nMARY L.

GROSTIC:  Yes.  \nTHE COURT:  I will make that recommendation.  \nWhere were you housed during your last term of \nincarceration, Mr. Esteras?\nTHE DEFENDANT:  Hazelton. \nTHE COURT:  Hazelton.  I don't know what the \npolicy of the Bureau of Prisons is regarding sending you \nback to a place where you've been.  If there is no \nprohibition, if they were to send you back to Hazelton, is \nthat something you'd like me to ask for, or would you rather \nsomething even closer to home, such as Elkton? \nTHE DEFENDANT:  Yeah, closer to home. \nTHE COURT:  More like Elkton than Hazelton?\nTHE DEFENDANT:  Yes, ma'am. \nTHE COURT:  All right.  I will make that \nrecommendation.  \nWhat else?  What other recommendations, if there \nare any, Mr. Grostic?  \nMR. GROSTIC:  May I have one moment, Your Honor?  \nTHE COURT:  Certainly. \n(Discussion held off the record between the defendant \nAppendix F\n46a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n17:21:41\n17:21:57\n17:22:17\n17:22:31\n17:22:44\nMARY L.

GROSTIC:  Your Honor, Mr. Esteras would also \nrequest that the Court recommend that he be evaluated for \nplacement in any applicable drug treatment program, as well \nas any applicable behavioral management or mental health \ntreatment program for which he might qualify. \nTHE COURT:  Thank you.  I will make both of those \nrecommendations as well.  \nMy belief, Mr. Esteras, is that a 24-month term, \nwhile longer than one you would like, I'm sure, is not long \nenough for the most intensive drug treatment program, but I \nam sure there are others that may be helpful to you.  And I \nhope that along with my recommendation, you will sign up and \napply yourself to any programs that you're admitted.  And I \nwill recommend those for behavioral management and drug \ntreatment.  \nWhat else, if anything else?  I am open to \nadopting whatever you recommend if it will help Mr. Esteras.  \nMR. GROSTIC:  No, nothing further, Your Honor.  \nThank you.  \nTHE COURT:  Your objection to the sentence imposed \non behalf of your client, Mr. Grostic.  \nMR. GROSTIC:  Your Honor, I believe the Court \nindicated that it considered factors -- the factor in \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A) as part of its sentence.  I have \nAppendix F\n47a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n17:23:12\n17:23:31\n17:23:44\n17:24:05\n17:24:27\nMARY L. UPHOLD, RDR, CRR         (330) 884-7424\n92\nobjected to that in the past.  I am aware that actually the \nSixth Circuit has held that that is something the Court can \nconsider, but I would simply like to lodge that objection \nfor the record.  \nTHE COURT:  Mr. Grostic, when you specify Section \n3553(a)(2)(A), are you referring to underneath -- (2) is the \nneed for the sentence to be imposed, correct?  You are \nspecifically objecting to, \"to reflect the seriousness of \nthe offense, to promote respect for the law, and provide \njust punishment for the offense,\" that's what you're \ndirecting your objection to?  \nMR. GROSTIC:  That's correct, Your Honor. \nTHE COURT:  To any one of those three subfactors \nor all of them? \nMR. GROSTIC:  All of them, yes.  \nTHE COURT:  Well, I would agree with you, part of \nmy contemplation certainly is the need for the sentence \nimposed, to promote respect for the law.  I mentioned \ndeterring Mr. Esteras as well.  I also meant, and I think \nit's fair for you to infer, concern about the safety of the \ncommunity, which is later beyond (a)(2).  And I specifically \nreferenced the ability even to depart or, pardon me, vary \nupwards to separate Mr. Esteras from the average, typical, \nmine run-type defendant.  \nSo I think I have sufficiently addressed what your \nAppendix F\n48a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n17:24:45\n17:25:06\n17:25:26\n17:25:42\n17:26:00\nMARY L. UPHOLD, RDR, CRR         (330) 884-7424\n93\nobjection is, and you are entitled to it.  \nI will add just one other point.  If it enlarges \nyour objection, you will be able to tell me.  \nWhen I told counsel earlier that this is a 104(a) \nhearing, under the rules of evidence, that they're \nsuspended, I still, being a student of the rules of \nevidence, it is hard to put them out of your mind.  And even \nthough I am not obligated to explicitly make calls on \nmatters, objections, sustain, overrule them, I still try to \nhew closely to considering evidence in a way that makes \nsense when the rules of evidence are considered.  \nAnd I want the record to reflect that when I did \nthat, and I suspect Mr. Grostic might have been doing this \nas well, I kept in mind Rule of Evidence 803.  Rule of \nEvidence 803 is one of those rules that outlines exceptions \nto the rules against hearsay, and it explicitly says, \n\"Regardless of whether a declarant is available as a \nwitness, Judge, you can consider certain things.\"  \nAnd these are things that are well established to \nbe truthful, or more likely than not, I should say, to be \ntruthful, credible.  And they include present sense \nimpressions, statements made while explaining an event or \ncondition, those statements made immediately after the \ndeclarant perceived it.  \nSo like those statements, Mr. Esteras, that \nAppendix F\n49a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n17:26:18\n17:26:36\n17:26:54\n17:27:11\n17:27:33\nMARY L. UPHOLD, RDR, CRR         (330) 884-7424\n94\nMs. Infante made as soon as Officer DiMaiolo showed up, I \nconsidered, because I believe, as Mr. Joyce said, she was \nher most credible at those moments.  \n\"Excited utterance, a statement relating to a \nstartling event or condition made while the declarant was \nunder the stress of the excitement that it caused.\"  \nThose folks in that house, the youngster, the \nwoman with the box braids, the two young women who were \nstanding on either side of Ms. Infante, one of whom was the \none who said, \"I was scared.  I can't watch TV.\"  The other \nsaid, \"Why he point a gun at us?\"  I considered those \nexcited utterances and found them to be credible.  \n\"Then existing mental, emotional, or physical \ncondition\" is another one of those categories that has sort \nof a threshold, a built-in credibility.  I don't have to \naccept them, but I use that as a way to cabin what I was \nhearing on the witness stand compared to what I had heard in \nthat video.  \nSo I used those things, Mr. Grostic.  And I think \nthat was part of the argument made by Mr. Joyce to \ncorroborate what I heard on the video and to discredit what \nI heard from Ms. Infante during most of her testimony.  \nThere were nuggets of truth, very few of them.  Most of the \ntime she made up answers purposefully to distinguish today's \ntestimony from what we saw in the video.  \nAppendix F\n50a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n17:27:42\n17:27:58\n17:28:12\n17:28:24\n17:28:42\nMARY L.

GROSTIC:  No, nothing further, Your Honor.  \nThank you.  \nTHE COURT:  Thank you.  \nThank you for the work you've done, Counselors, in \nmaking a full record.  \nMr. Esteras, I meant it when I said earlier that I \nam proud of you for earning your GED.  That told me, even \nafter you knew you were not obligated to do it, you \npersisted and you did it.  \nMy hope is you'll give some thoughts to your \ncondition, your own circumstances, your role in these \nconditions and circumstances, and you will continue despite \nwhat you think anyone thinks about you, go forward, improve \nyourself and have a better life.

But my hope is you'll go \nforward.  The three years of supervised release won't only \nbe punitive.

Dustin, Dexter Phillips, \nUNITED STATES ATTORNEY\u2019S OFFICE, Toledo, Ohio, for Appellee. \n_________________ \nOPINION \n_________________ \nTHAPAR, Circuit Judge.  Timothy Jaimez pled guilty to federal drug charges.  After his \nsecond supervised-release violation, the district court sentenced him to sixty months\u2019 \nimprisonment.  Because that sentence is procedurally and substantively reasonable, we affirm.  \n>\nAppendix G\n53a\n\nNo. 23-3189 \nUnited States v. Jaimez \nPage 2 \n \n \nI. \n \nTimothy Jaimez pled guilty to conspiring to possess narcotics with the intent to distribute \nthem.  After serving time in prison, he began a term of supervised release.  While on release, \nJaimez used drugs, failed to maintain employment, and failed to truthfully disclose financial \ninformation to his probation officer.  So a court revoked his release.   \n \nWhen Jaimez began a second term of supervised release, his behavior didn\u2019t improve.  \nPolice found him transporting marijuana in his car with the co-felons from his original \nconviction.  And at Jaimez\u2019s properties, police found cocaine base, a shell casing, and a drug \npress.  Based on this conduct, an Ohio court found Jaimez guilty of attempting to traffic \nmarijuana.   \n \nThe United States then sought to revoke Jaimez\u2019s release.  It alleged three violations:  \n(1) being charged with a new crime, (2) associating with known felons, and (3) possessing drug \nparaphernalia.  In line with probation\u2019s report, the court classified Jaimez\u2019s first violation as \n\u201cGrade A\u201d under the Sentencing Guidelines.  See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.1(a)(1).  That carried a \nsentencing range of fifty-one to sixty months\u2019 incarceration.  See id. \u00a7 7B1.4(a); 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 3583(e)(3).  Over Jaimez\u2019s objection, the district court sentenced him to sixty months\u2019 \nincarceration, followed by six years of supervised release.   \nII. \nJaimez now appeals, claiming his sentence is procedurally and substantively \nunreasonable.  Applying an abuse-of-discretion standard, we conclude that it\u2019s neither.  See \nUnited States v. Adams, 873 F.3d 512, 516\u201317 (6th Cir. 2017). \nA. \n \nJaimez first challenges his sentence\u2019s procedural reasonableness.  He argues the court \n(1) inadequately explained his sentence, (2) improperly considered section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors, \nand (3) incorrectly classified his release violation as Grade A.  Jaimez is wrong on all three \ncounts.  \nAppendix G\n54a\n\nNo. 23-3189 \nUnited States v. Jaimez \nPage 3 \n \n \n \nAdequate Explanation.  A court need not \u201cengage in a ritualistic incantation\u201d of statutory \nsentencing factors.  United States v. Chandler, 419 F.3d 484, 488 (6th Cir. 2005) (citation \nomitted).  Nor must a court explicitly address every factor.  United States v. Collington, 461 F.3d \n805, 809 (6th Cir. 2006).  Rather, the record needs to show only that the court considered the \napplicable factors.  United States v. McBride, 434 F.3d 470, 474 (6th Cir. 2006).   \nJaimez\u2019s sentencing passes this very easy test.  During sentencing, the court discussed \nJaimez\u2019s Guidelines range with the parties.  See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(4)(B), 3583(e).  The court \nreferenced Jaimez\u2019s criminal history and previous release violations.  See id. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(1), \n3583(e).  The court also sought to deter Jaimez and others from violating release conditions.  See \nid. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B), 3583(e).  And the court recognized a need to promote respect for the law \nand protect the public.  See id. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), (C), 3583(e); see also United States v. Lewis, \n498 F.3d 393, 399 (6th Cir. 2007).  Given this record, it\u2019s clear the court considered the federal \nsentencing factors. \n \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A) Factors.  Jaimez next takes issue with the factors the court did \nexpressly consider:  the seriousness of his offense, the promotion of respect for the law, and the \nprovision of just punishment.  Jaimez argues the court shouldn\u2019t have considered these factors \nbecause the statute governing revocation doesn\u2019t require it.  See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e).  But we\u2019ve \nmade clear that district courts may nonetheless consider these factors when imposing revocation \nsentences.  See Lewis, 498 F.3d at 399\u2013400; United States v. Esteras, 88 F.4th 1163, 1167\u201370 \n(6th Cir. 2023), reh\u2019g en banc denied, --- F.4th ----, 2024 WL 981140 (6th Cir. 2024).1  Thus, it \nwasn\u2019t unreasonable for the court to consider them here. \n \nViolation Grade.  A release violation is \u201cGrade A\u201d if it involves drug conduct punishable \nby more than a year in prison.  U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.1(a)(1).  Here, there was sufficient evidence of \nsuch conduct.  First, police witnessed Jaimez and his co-felons transport \u201cjust under a kilogram\u201d \nof marijuana in his car.  R. 381, Pg. ID 2169.  Second, Jaimez\u2019s car smelled like marijuana, \nsuggesting Jaimez\u2014a past drug user\u2014knew there were drugs in it.  Third, an Ohio court found \n \n1Judge Griffin adheres to his dissent from the denial of the petition to rehear Esteras en banc.  United \nStates v. Esteras, --- F.4th ----, 2024 WL 981140, at *1 (6th Cir. 2024) (Griffin, J., dissenting from denial of \nrehearing en banc). \nAppendix G\n55a\n\nNo. 23-3189 \nUnited States v. Jaimez \nPage 4 \n \n \nJaimez guilty of attempted marijuana trafficking, indicating he knew or had reason to know the \nmarijuana was intended for resale.  See Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7 2923.02(A) (noting that an \n\u201cattempt\u201d conviction means the defendant met any \u201cknowledge\u201d or \u201cpurpose\u201d elements of the \nunderlying crime); id. \u00a7 2925.03(A)(2) (defining mens rea for drug trafficking).  Based on this \nevidence, a court could conclude Jaimez knowingly transported just under a kilogram of \nmarijuana, aware it was intended for resale.  See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (setting a \npreponderance-of-the-evidence standard for revocation decisions).  And under Ohio law, that\u2019s \npunishable by over a year in prison.2  Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 2925.03(A)(2), (C)(3)(c), \n2929.14(A)(4).  Thus, the district court correctly graded Jaimez\u2019s violation. \nB. \n \nJaimez next alleges his sentence is substantively unreasonable.  In particular, he argues \nthe court (1) placed too much weight on the conduct underlying his release violation, (2) inflicted \n\u201cdouble punishment\u201d by considering conduct for which Ohio already punished him, and \n(3) imposed a sentence that was too long in light of mitigating evidence.  Again, Jaimez is wrong \non all three counts.  \n \nJaimez\u2019s Violative Conduct.  At sentencing, the district court \u201ckeyed in\u201d on the conduct \nunderlying Jaimez\u2019s release violation.  Appellant Suppl. Br. 2.  For good reason:  Jaimez was \noriginally convicted for conspiring to distribute drugs, and he had previously violated his \nsupervised release by using drugs.  Given this background, the conduct underlying his most \nrecent violation\u2014transporting drugs with the intent to resell them\u2014was particularly relevant.  \nWhen imposing revocation sentences, courts may consider the need to promote deterrence and \nrespect for the law.  18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2013(B), 3583(e); see Lewis, 498 F.3d at 399.  \nJaimez\u2019s most recent violation demonstrated a flagrant lack of both.  Thus, it was reasonable for \nthe court to give substantial weight to that violation at sentencing.  Cf. United States v. Zobel, \n696 F.3d 558, 571\u201372 (6th Cir. 2012).   \n \n2Ohio found Jaimez guilty of only a misdemeanor-level marijuana offense.  But when a federal court \ngrades a release violation, it considers the defendant\u2019s actual conduct, not just the record of conviction.  United \nStates v. Montgomery, 893 F.3d 935, 940 (6th Cir. 2018). \nAppendix G\n56a\n\nNo. 23-3189 \nUnited States v. Jaimez \nPage 5 \n \n \n \nDouble Punishment.  Jaimez next argues he received \u201cdouble punishment\u201d for his drug-\ntrafficking activity.  Appellant Suppl. Br. 3.  But this presents no error, either.  To be sure, Ohio \nalready punished Jaimez for the drug-related conduct that the district court considered at \nsentencing.  But that\u2019s the point:  the Sentencing Guidelines explicitly tell courts to consider the \ncriminal nature of a release violation.  See U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 7B1.1(a), .4(a).  And the Supreme Court \nhas long held that federal and state governments may separately punish an individual for the \nsame conduct.  See, e.g., Heath v. Alabama, 474 U.S. 82, 88 (1985); Fox v. Ohio, 46 U.S. (5 \nHow.) 410, 435 (1847).   \nJaimez\u2019s argument also fails for a simpler reason:  revocation sentences are never \n\u201cpunishment\u201d for a release violation.  Rather, these sentences are \u201cpart of the penalty for the \ninitial offense\u201d\u2014in this case, Jaimez\u2019s original narcotics-distribution conspiracy.  Johnson v. \nUnited States, 529 U.S. 694, 700\u201301 (2000).  Indeed, even when a court expressly considers the \nconduct underlying a release violation, we don\u2019t interpret the resulting sentence as \u201cpunishment\u201d \nfor that conduct.  See, e.g., United States v. Johnson, 640 F.3d 195, 203 (6th Cir. 2011) (holding \nthat a revocation sentence is a \u201csanction\u201d for a defendant\u2019s \u201cbreach of trust,\u201d not a \u201cpunishment \nfor [his] violation\u201d (citation omitted)); United States v. Jones, 81 F.4th 591, 602 n.7 (6th Cir. \n2023) (same); Esteras, 88 F.4th at 1170 (holding that a court\u2019s consideration of violative conduct \ndoesn\u2019t make a revocation sentence punitive, even when the court uses the word \u201cpunishment\u201d).  \nThus, the district court\u2019s sentence didn\u2019t \u201cdouble punish\u201d Jaimez for his violation. \n \nSentence Length.  At the outset, we presume Jaimez\u2019s within-Guidelines sentence is \nreasonable.  See Jones, 81 F.4th at 602.  Jaimez contends otherwise.  He argues the court \nshouldn\u2019t have applied the maximum sentence because his release violations could have been \nworse.  He also asserts that he\u2019s been trying to \u201crebuild[] his life.\u201d  Reply Br. 3.  And he \nemphasizes that he didn\u2019t contest his release violations or his Ohio drug charge.  This, he claims, \ndemonstrates his \u201cremorse.\u201d  Id.   \nBut Jaimez\u2019s arguments aren\u2019t enough to establish unreasonableness.  The fact Jaimez \ncould\u2019ve committed a worse offense doesn\u2019t render the statutory maximum unreasonable.  Every \ndrug trafficker could have shipped more drugs, just like every murderer could have killed an \nadditional person.  That doesn\u2019t mean courts should never apply a maximum sentence.   \nAppendix G\n57a\n\nNo. 23-3189 \nUnited States v. Jaimez \nPage 6 \n \n \nNor can Jaimez show unreasonableness by arguing he would have given more weight to \nmitigating evidence.  See United States v. Ely, 468 F.3d 399, 404 (6th Cir. 2006).  And even if he \ncould, his mitigating evidence is paper-thin.  While his words suggested remorse, his conduct did \nnot.  At Jaimez\u2019s last revocation hearing, the court warned him that he\u2019d receive a sixty-month \nsentence if he didn\u2019t straighten out his act.  That didn\u2019t stop Jaimez from continuing to flout the \nlaw.  And at some point, protecting the public must trump a defendant\u2019s desire to \u201crebuild his \nlife.\u201d  This is one such case. \n* \n* \n* \n \nWe affirm. \nAppendix G\n58a\n\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO \nWESTERN DIVISION \nUnited States of America, \nCase No. 3:10cr4-2 \nPlaintiff \nv. \nORDER \nTimothy M.

And, yes, it was put in The\nBlade, but it didn't hurt me at all, Your Honor, because I\nhave no connection to the streets anymore.  So, like I\nsaid, I put myself in a very bad situation time and time\nagain.  It's not your fault, it's not Ms. Dustin's fault,\nnobody's fault but my own.  I'm just sorry that I'm\ndragging down people that are close to me and people who I\ndo -- I do care about and love, that I affect their lives\nas well.  So as of -- since the beginning of all of this,\nI've taken my own -- when I'm in the wrong, I take\nresponsibility and I keep on moving.  And with that, I\nagree with whatever you give me, Your Honor.  Thank you.\nTHE COURT:  Mr. Schuman, anything further?\nMR. SCHUMAN:  No, thank you, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT:  Anything further from the government?\nMS. DUSTIN:  Nothing, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT:  Pursuant to the Sentencing Reform Act\nof 1984 and 18 U.S. Code Section 3553(a), judgment of this\nCourt that defendant be and hereby committed to the custody\nof the Bureau of Prisons to serve a term of 60 months.  \nUpon completion of that term, you should report\nwithin 72 hours U.S. Pretrial and Probation Office in this\ndistrict or U.S. Probation Office in whatever district you\nare released.\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\nAppendix I\n61a\n\n    63\nI will, likewise, strongly encourage the Bureau\nto let you serve your time in Milan.  I don't know if\nyou're a threat, or security issue, or anything else.  To\nthe extent that their mechanistic computation might put you\nat a higher security level, I would encourage them to look\npast that and enable both of you to remain in contact with\nyour people here in Toledo.  \nI'm going to place you, likewise, on a period of\nsix more years of supervised release.  I'll be very candid\nwith you, I'm going to be very candid with both of you, I\nwant this Court to have that string.  And if you can't\nabide by each term and condition of supervised release,\nyou'll be right back in front of me or another Judge.  And\nyou'll wind up, yet again -- but you've shown that\nbasically, now twice, the terms and conditions of\nsupervised release are optional.  And they are not\noptional.  And I want to make sure, in terms of your own\ninterest, and the interest of the community, and to protect\nthe community, and also anybody who knows what's happening\nhere today gets it that disregarding the terms and\nconditions of supervised release, particularly in the\nquantity -- if large quantity of Controlled Substance is\ninvolved, you're going to get punished.  You're going to\npay a severe consequence.  I hope you understand that,\nMr. Watters.  You've went through it, I remember it\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\nAppendix I\n62a\n\n    64\nvividly, I remember correctly Officer Robinson was just\ntrying to get some financial information, you were\nproviding her with statements about your employment and\noccupation and so forth.  She wanted to know.  And if I\nrecall correctly, she had to go knocking on doors of banks.\nIt was an exhaustive time consuming effort on her part that\nshould not -- she should not have had to take the time to\nget the information she did had you been honest with her.\nYou blew her off, you blew off the conditions of supervised\nrelease about responding to the request for financial\ninformation.  And at least that night when you're out there\nwith your brother and Mr. Carrizales and the garbage bag\nwith a lot of marijuana in it, upward of a kilo, once\nagain, you were paying no attention to the terms and\nconditions of supervised release.  And my lengthy term of\ncontinued supervised release is to try to see to it that,\nat long last, you get it, and also to serve -- not just try\nto see to it that you do, but that you learn to comply with\nwhat The Court and the law tells you you have to do.\nAlso to make clear to the public generally that\nsomeone like yourself doesn't get it, then they're going to\nget prison time, and a lot of it.  That's the purpose of my\nsentence.\nYou will report to the pretrial service and\nprobation office.  All of the previous terms and conditions\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\nAppendix I\n63a\n\n    65\nwill be reimposed.  \nAnd Officer Hagins, is there anything else at\nthis time?  There'll be the special condition about\nundertaking to obtain and maintain lawful gainful\nemployment, and to cooperate with the probation officer and\nyour officer's efforts in that regard.\nOnce again, you'll be required to provide,\npromptly and accurately, any requested financial\ninformation that the probation officer may ask you to\nprovide.\nOfficer Hagins, any further special conditions\nyou'd like me to impose or reimpose?\nPROBATION:  No, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT:  Okay.  I believe I expressed my --\nthe -- my reasons for imposition of this sentence.  They\nare to protect the public.  They are to encourage\nunderstanding of compliance of the terms and conditions,\nindividual deterrence, and public deterrence.  In this\nCourt there's no such thing as an optional condition of\nsupervision, just as there's no optional condition when\nyou're on pretrial release.  They're court orders, and this\nis a consequence of not obeying a court order.  I told you\nbefore, Mr. Watters, you're not in The State system\nanymore.  We care, we pay attention, and we respond.\nI have considered your background, history and\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\nAppendix I\n64a\n\n    66\ncharacteristics, your prior criminal record with which I'm\nobviously quite familiar.  And I do think that somebody\nlooking at this with the overall circumstances would find\nthat this is both a just and deserved sanction, and would\nhope that it would enhance respect for the law.\nMs. Dustin, anything further you want me to say\nabout the 3553(a) factors?\nMS. DUSTIN:  Perhaps just addressing the\ndeterrence factor.\nTHE COURT:  I can't quite hear you.\nMS. DUSTIN:  Perhaps address the deterrence\nfactor, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT:  I thought I had, both individual and\npublic deterrence.  I hope others hear about this.  When\nyou come to Federal Court, you're in the big leagues.  We\nplay hard ball.  There's no paddle ball here, okay, no\nshrug of the shoulders.  We give you a chance at a break,\nyou don't take that chance, we move things up a notch.  And\nyou're really Exhibit A in that regard, Mr. Watters.  I'm\nsorry that you are, but I think it's necessary that you be\nso that people understand they can't be out abroad in the\ncompany of people you shouldn't be with doing things that\nthe law prohibits and expect -- if you get caught, we'll\nsimply reinstate the terms and conditions of supervised\nrelease and tell you to behave, tell you to do that,\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\nAppendix I\n65a\n\n    67\nbecause that's the bottom line when we get right down to\nit.  \nI do believe that the sentence is sufficient but\nnot greater than necessary to get your attention, to see to\nit, I hope, that once you are out, you will, at long last,\nlearn that lesson.  You've got to do, no matter how much\nyou don't want to do it, you may desire to do something\nelse, as long as you're on supervised release for this\nCourt, you've got to do what this Court, myself, and the\nprobation officer says.  That's your only option.  Because\nif you don't and you come back, whoever sees you then,\nwhether it's I or somebody else, is going to look at this,\nand they're going to ask, just as I did, implicitly, how\nhigh is up, because going up as high as I can so that I\nbelieve it's necessary, particularly in your circumstance,\nto make clear that you've got to do what the law and The\nCourt requires.  If you don't, this is what's going to\nhappen to somebody else who hears about it.  They've got a\nsimilar situation, I hope they get the lesson that that's\nwhat's going to happen to them.  Ultimately I'm protecting\nthe community.\nAnything further you want me to say, Ms. Dustin,\nabout the 3553(a) factors?\nMS. DUSTIN:  No, Your Honor.  Thank you.\nTHE COURT:  You have a right, as I've indicated\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\nAppendix I\n66a\n\n    68\nto Mr. Carrizales, to appeal.  Talk to Mr. Schuman, your\nvery capable lawyer, as that Mr. Wagner is, and if grounds\nto appeal appear to exist, by all means within 14 days file\na notice of appeal.  If you decide to have him and he\ndesires to continue to represent you, he'll do so without\ncost to yourself.  The record will be prepared without cost\nto yourself.  And if either you or he wants you to have\nanother attorney, different attorney, we'll make that\nrequest known to either me or to the Court of Appeals.  Do\nyou understand all that?\nDEFENDANT WATTERS:  Yes, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT:  Within 14 days, 14 days.  It's a very\nshort timeframe.  After that, you will lose -- if you\nhaven't filed a notice of appeal, you will lose any and all\nright you might otherwise have to challenge what I've done\ntoday, either by way of direct appeal, post-conviction\nrelief, or habeas corpus.  Do you understand that?\nDEFENDANT WATTERS:  Yes, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT:  I want to repeat that to you too,\nMr. Carrizales; 14 days, otherwise you lose the opportunity\nto challenge whatever.\nDoes any party have any objection to any part of\nthese proceedings not previously made?\nMR. WAGNER:  No, Your Honor.\nMR. SCHUMAN:  Your Honor, few remarks if I may.\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\nAppendix I\n67a\n\n    69\nI have a few requests if I may.\nTHE COURT:  Sure.\nMR. SCHUMAN:  Thank you, Your Honor.\nMy client wishes to have the no contact order\nwith Mr. Carrizales removed; credit for 13 months in\ncustody on this violation, which I think is appropriate.\nHe requested 14-months credit for the time served on the\nearlier violation.  He notes he had three years of\nsupervised release previously.\nI object, for the record, to the sentence imposed\nfor purpose of appeal.\nMy client also notes that his proper last name\nnow is -- I hope I say it correctly, Jaimez J-A-I-M-E-Z.\nHis name was legally changed in State Court in Ohio some\nyears ago.\nTHE COURT:  I think -- you know, I think that had\noccurred before, but it wasn't brought to my attention.  I\nwill note that.  Let me only say I'm going to refrain from\nmaking any recommendation as to what the Bureau of Prisons\nshould do in terms of his computation for time served.\nThat's entirely within the province of the Bureau of\nPrisons.  \nCorrect, Ms. Sterling?\nMS. DUSTIN:  Your Honor, I believe he would not\nget credit because he was already serving time on The State\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\nAppendix I\n68a\n\n    70\noffense.  I think he was being held with -- he already got\ncredit for that time.  He did not have to serve the 180\ndays because they gave him credit for the 180 days.\nTHE COURT:  All I'm saying -- I don't know, it's\nreally out of my hands.  I can sit and try to do a\ncomputation.  I will simply say that I expect that, both\nMr. Carrizales and he, shall oversee what the Bureau of\nPrisons will be attentive and accurately calculate the time\nserved credit as to the sentence that I've imposed.  Beyond\nthat, I can't -- I have no authority to -- Ms. Sterling,\nyou and I have had a couple of occasions where it was made\nvery clear to me that that computation, whether a defendant\nbelieves it's correct or not, cannot come back to me to\nsecure any kind of -- is that right, Ms. Sterling?\nMS. STERLING:  That is correct, Your Honor.  I\nthink there's a distinction here, although it's one without\na difference, and that is this; if a defendant is being\nheld solely on this Court's violation order, then he would\nget credit.  However, at least six months for these\ngentlemen, because they received credit for six months on\nThe State case, they would not get credit for.  And the way\nThe Court is supposed to accomplish that is by imposing a\nhigher sentence than what you normally would have, but you\ncan't do that here because you sentenced them at the\nstatutory maximum.  So I think for the record that explains\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\nAppendix I\n69a\n\n    71\nthat.\nWith regard to the protection order issue that\nMr. Schuman raised between the two; again, that is a matter\nthat will be addressed by the BOP relative to their\nsecurity concerns.\nTHE COURT:  Right.  I do hope both of you\ngentlemen are up the road rather than some distant isolated\nfederal facility that, from a practical standpoint, will\nmake it difficult, if not impossible, to bring your family\nto have a face-to-face visitation or contact.  I think,\ncandidly, with just about everybody who comes before me,\nconfining them as close to home as possible is an important\ncomponent ultimately of reentry and rehabilitation.  Family\ncontact is and remains, in my view, important.  But, once\nagain, Mr. Schuman, that's all that I can do.  I'll take\nnote of that.  I'll certainly expect the Bureau of Prisons\nto accurately and attentively calculate the proper credit\nfor time served.\nMR. SCHUMAN:  I understand, Your Honor.\nMy only last comment is my client indicates that\nThe Court previously directed the Marshals to correct his\nlast name to Jaimez.  Apparently it didn't happen.  I'll\nleave it at that.\nTHE COURT:  I will so instruct the Marshals.  May\nI suggest that you go on upstairs and get in touch with\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\nAppendix I\n70a\n\n    72\nAlex and both, formally and informally, make that request.\nI also suggest that you send a copy of that -- CC that\nrequest to Pete Elliot, who's the U.S. Marshal.  And I also\nsuggest, follow up on it.\nMR. SCHUMAN:  Thank you, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT:  In that respect, a phone call from me\nto anybody needing my help, I'm glad to do that.  I really\nam.  I now remember I think that had occurred before the\nlast -- the last supervised release proceedings.\nMR. SCHUMAN:  I think so, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT:  And I apologize, I had forgotten\nthat.  Mr. Watters is still -- Mr. Jaimez.\nMR. SCHUMAN:  Jaimez.\nTHE COURT:  -- is still being considered to be\nMr. Timothy Watters.  So that's why --\nMR. SCHUMAN:  Thank you, Your Honor.\nMS. DUSTIN:  Your Honor, I think we were having a\ndiscussion, and I don't think Mr. Schuman answered the\nBostic question.\nTHE COURT:  I'm sorry, I can't hear you.\nMS. DUSTIN:  I don't think Mr. Schuman answered\nthe Bostic question.\nTHE COURT:  Okay.  Any other objections not\npreviously made, Mr. Schuman?\nMR. SCHUMAN:  No, Your Honor.\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\nAppendix I\n71a\n\n    73\nMS. STERLING:  Mr. Wagner, once again?\nMR. WAGNER:  No, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT:  Okay.  That will conclude this\nproceeding.\nCOURTROOM DEPUTY:  Your Honor, there's a pending\nmotion to be addressed on the record about Mr. Watters.\nTHE COURT:  You have some motions, Mr. Schuman,\npreviously made that are going to be withdrawn; is that\ncorrect?\nMR.

Am I correct?  \nPROBATION OFFICER:  That is correct, \nYour Honor. \nTHE COURT:  All right.  It is generally my \npractice not to consider new law violations that have not \nbeen resolved, so I am not going to consider alleged \nViolation Number 2.  \nNumber 3, failure to report. \nMr. Leaks failed to report on May 18th, May 31st, and \nJune 8th of 2022. \nThe fourth is failure to attend mental health \ntreatment. \nHe failed to attend group session on May 13th, \nMay 24th, and June 1st of 2022. \nFifth, failure to work towards GED. \nAppendix L\n80a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n5\nHe failed to work toward getting the GED -- GED since \ncommencing supervision. \nAnd finally, a new law violation.  \nOn May 11th, 2023, Mr. Leaks pled guilty to having a \nweapon while under disability with a 3-year sentence to run \nconcurrent with the new law violation that I've already \ndiscussed, Violation Number 1. \nMr. Roberts, on behalf of your client, do you wish for \nthis Court to hear testimony regarding these alleged \nviolations, or do you waive the taking of testimony and \nadmit?  \nMR. ROBERTS:  Your Honor, in light of the fact \nthat the Court is not considering Violation Number 2 at this \ntime, we waive the testimony and do admit to the other \nviolations. \nTHE COURT:  Sir, do you understand what your \nattorney just said to me?  \nTHE DEFENDANT:  Yes, ma'am. \nTHE COURT:  And do you, in fact, admit to \nViolations 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6?  \nTHE DEFENDANT:  Yes, ma'am. \nTHE COURT:  Sir, based upon your admission, I \ndo in fact find you to be in violation of supervised \nrelease. \nI find that the most serious is a Grade B violation, \nAppendix L\n81a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n6\nand with a Criminal History Category of III you are looking \nat an advisory sentencing guideline range of 8 to 14 months. \nOn the issue of sentencing, Mr. Roberts, should I turn \nto you first or your client?  \nMR. ROBERTS:  Your Honor, just briefly, we \nunderstand because of the nature of the violation that the \nCourt is required by statute to impose a term of \nimprisonment.  We would ask the Court to run any term of \nimprisonment concurrent to the now 4 to 6 years that \nMr. Leaks received.  He obviously accepted responsibility \nfor that case and, actually, when you look at the purposes \nof sentencing, at least on a supervised release violation, \nTitle 18 United States Code \u00a7 3583(a) specifically omits the \nCourt's consideration of Title 18 United States Code \n3553(a)(2) which otherwise would be present in a regular \nsentencing, that being the seriousness of the offense, \nrespect for law and punishment.  All of those are omitted \nfrom a supervised release sentencing and have been addressed \nwith the 4 to 6-year sentence that he received for the \nconduct in the new law violation. \nWe would ask the Court to consider that he's going to \nbe on 18 months' mandatory post-release control also on that \ncase and will continue to be supervised by court officials \nas he seeks to re-enter the community and rehabilitate \nhimself. \nAppendix L\n82a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n7\nThank you, Your Honor. \nTHE COURT:  Mr. Leaks, do you have anything to \nsay, sir?  \nTHE DEFENDANT:  Um. . . I just would like to \nsay that I learned my lesson and I want to make sure that I \ninfluence my younger family members that look up to me and \nthink, what are we doing or whatever I was contributing to \nwas cool, that this ain't the way to go. \nTHE COURT:  Mr. Zarzycki. \nMR. ZARZYCKI:  Thank you, Your Honor.  \nIt's the government's position that a consecutive \nguideline sentence is appropriate for Mr. Leaks, under \n7B1.3(f), that it was to be served consecutively to a \nsentence of imprisonment. \nYour Honor, this involved a -- as the Court's aware \nfrom having his original case, involved the Possession of a \nMachine Gun and next to this machine gun -- which \nwas functional -- there were three magazines, 15 rounds, \n20 rounds and 30 rounds.  So his violations -- like, he was \nsentenced to 4 years for the criminal offenses that he \ncommitted.  I ask the Court to impose a consecutive sentence \nbecause of the violations of this Court's supervision, and \nthat supervision was based on the prior offense of -- or his \nconviction of having this dangerous machine gun. \nNow, one of his offenses to which he's been convicted \nAppendix L\n83a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n8\nin state court involves another firearm as recently as \nFebruary of this year. \nAnother offense is a robbery that is an offense of \nviolence as well as his failure to adhere to any of the -- \nor many of the requirements of his supervision. \nI believe that a consecutive sentence would be \nappropriate for those violations. \nTHE COURT:  Mr. Capuano. \nPROBATION OFFICER:  Hello, Your Honor. \nYour Honor, U.S. Probation Office would just like to \nadd that, unfortunately, this is a very unfortunate \ncircumstance for Mr. Leaks.  Mr. Leaks is a very young man.  \nHe has a lot of future ahead of him and these are some very \nserious charges that he has in front of him violations-wise. \nIn regard to recommendations, Your Honor, we would \nalso recommend that a term of imprisonment is imposed and \nthat it be served consecutive to his state sentence as well. \nOriginally we were recommending a term of supervised \nrelease to follow as well.  However, based upon his state \nsentences, he does have mandatory post-release control with \nthe State of Ohio with the Adult Parole Authority and we \nwould not be opposed to -- if he does not have supervised \nrelease through us, Your Honor, following the sentence. \nThank you. \nTHE COURT:  Mr. Roberts, anything else?  \nAppendix L\n84a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n9\nMR. ROBERTS:  No, Your Honor, other than to -- \njust to reiterate, I know there's been reference to the \nseriousness of the offenses, both the original offense and \nthe new offense, and I would just reiterate that he's been \nsentenced and is serving his time for those. \nThank you, Your Honor. \nTHE COURT:  And yet I agree with all of the \nstatements made by Mr. Zarzycki.  To be on supervision and \nhave five violations, two of which are new law violations, \nboth involving firearms, and the original offense here \ninvolved a machine gun.  Concurrent time does not punish \nMr. Leaks for violating supervision and -- and. . . that is \nnot justice. \nTherefore, it is the judgment of this Court that you \nbe committed to the custody of the Bureau of Prisons to be \nimprisoned for a term of 12 months consecutive to the time \nbeing served in the two state cases. \nThere will be no further supervision. \nMr. Leaks, I wish you the best, and I certainly hope \nyou turn your life around because you are a very young man, \nas Mr. Capuano pointed out.  \nBoy, this is not the road to go down.  You're going to \nbe in and out of prisons the rest of your life.  I see it.  \nI see it with one defendant after another. \nI don't want that for you.  I hope this is your \nAppendix L\n85a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n10\nwake-up call.  \nGood luck. \nTHE DEFENDANT:  Yes, ma'am. \nMR. ROBERTS:  Your Honor, just on Mr. Leaks' \nbehalf, if -- \nTHE COURT:  One moment, sir. \nMR. ROBERTS:  We would just object to the \nconsideration of punishment as it relates to the sentence.  \nI understand all of the other factors the Court may have \nconsidered, but as it relates to considering punishment from \nthe new offense, we would object in case he wants to perfect \nany kind of appeal on that issue. \nThank you. \nTHE COURT:  All righty.  \nSir, you certainly have the right to appeal, if you so \nchoose. \nTHE DEFENDANT:  Okay.  \nMR. ZARZYCKI:  Are we adjourned, Your Honor?  \nTHE COURT:  Oh, we're adjourned.  I'm sorry.\n    (Proceedings adjourned at 11:19 a.m.)\n \nC E R T I F I C A T E\nI certify that the foregoing is a correct transcript \nof the record of proceedings in the above-entitled matter \nprepared from my stenotype notes.\n/s/ Heather K.

Esteras \nPage 2 \n \n____________________ \nAMENDED ORDER \n____________________ \n \nSUTTON, Chief Judge.  Edgardo Esteras appeals the district court\u2019s order revoking his \nsupervised release and sentencing him to 24 months in prison.  We affirm the district court\u2019s \nrevocation order for the reasons that follow. \n \nIn 2018, Esteras pleaded guilty to conspiring to distribute and possess with intent to \ndistribute heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846.  Varying downward from a \nguidelines range of 15 to 21 months, the district court sentenced Esteras to 12 months of \nimprisonment, to be served consecutively with a 15-month prison term for violating his \nprobation for a prior federal drug-trafficking conviction, followed by six years of supervised \nrelease.  \n \nEsteras\u2019s six-year term of supervised release began in January 2020.  Three years later, in \nJanuary 2023, the probation officer reported to the district court that Esteras had violated the \nconditions of his supervised release (1) by committing domestic violence, aggravated menacing, \nand criminal damaging, and (2) by possessing a firearm.  The probation officer notified the \ndistrict court that the new criminal charges against Esteras had been dismissed at the victim\u2019s \nrequest.   \nJudge Benita Y. Pearson conducted a hearing and found that Esteras possessed a firearm \nwhile under supervised release.  She \u201cworr[ied]\u201d that her previous sentences for drug crimes and \nviolating an earlier supervised release term failed \u201cto deter [Esteras], to encourage [him] to be \nrespectful of the law.\u201d  R.439 at 83.  Based on his \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cdisrespectful\u201d behavior, she \nvaried upward from an advisory range of six to twelve months to impose a 24-month jail \nsentence, \u201clong enough to at least allow [Esteras] to reconsider [his] behavior.\u201d  Id. at 85.  She \nadded three years of supervised release to the sentence, including an anger management class \nand six months of location monitoring.  These conditions, Judge Pearson explained, would teach \nhim to \u201cdo better\u201d and \u201cthink before [he] act[s].\u201d  Id. \nAppendix B\n5a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 3 \n \n \nEsteras objected that the court should not have considered the three subfactors identified \nin 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) when crafting its sentence:  \u201cto reflect the seriousness of the \noffense, to promote respect for the law, and provide just punishment for the offense.\u201d  Id. at 92.  \nJudge Pearson agreed that \u201cpart of [her] contemplation certainly is the need for the sentence \nimposed, to promote respect for the law.\u201d  Id.  But she added that she also considered deterrence \nand community safety, which appear in other statutory provisions.  She also referenced her \ndecision to vary upward \u201cto separate Mr. Esteras from the average, typical, mine run-type \ndefendant.\u201d  Id.  \n \nIn closing the hearing, Judge Pearson expressed hope that Esteras would take advantage \nof this opportunity.  She acknowledged that some of the conventional features of supervised \nrelease could be seen as partly \u201cpunitive,\u201d such as location monitoring and other measures that \n\u201crestrict [his] freedom\u201d of movement.  Id.  She then referred to other terms, such as anger \nmanagement, as \u201cthere to bolster [him]\u201d and \u201chelp [him] to do better going forward.\u201d  Id. at 95\u2013\n96.  \n \nOn appeal, Esteras challenges his sentence on the ground that the district court relied on \nprohibited factors in sentencing him.  We disagree. \nCongress has authorized district courts to revoke supervised release.  See 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 3583(e).  In some settings, district courts have discretion to revoke, modify, or decrease a term \nof supervised release.  Id.  In other settings, as when a parolee possesses a weapon as Esteras did \nhere, the district court must revoke the individual\u2019s supervised release.  Id. \u00a7 3583(g).  Whether \nat the outset of sentencing an individual, in the context of a modified term of supervised release, \nor in the context of a required revocation of supervised release, Congress has directed courts to \nconsider certain factors.  In the words of Congress under the heading \u201cFactors to be considered \nin including a term of supervised release\u201d:  \u201cThe court . . . consider[s] the factors set forth in \nsection 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7).\u201d  Id. \n\u00a7 3583(c); see also id. \u00a7 3583(e) (similar for \u201cmodification of conditions or revocation\u201d of \nsupervised release).   \nAppendix B\n6a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 4 \n \nTo bring this provision into full view, here is a full recitation of \u00a7 3553(a) that italicizes \nthe factors that district courts need not consider in supervised-release determinations: \nThe court shall impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply \nwith the purposes set forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection. The court, in determining \nthe particular sentence to be imposed, shall consider\u2014 \n(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics \nof the defendant; \n(2) the need for the sentence imposed\u2014 \n(A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, \nand to provide just punishment for the offense; \n(B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; \n(C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and \n(D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational \ntraining, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective \nmanner; \n(3) the kinds of sentences available; \n(4) the kinds of sentence and the sentencing range established for\u2014 \n(A) the applicable category of offense committed by the applicable \ncategory of defendant as set forth in the guidelines\u2014 \n(i) issued by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to section \n994(a)(1) of title 28, United States Code, subject to any \namendments \nmade \nto \nsuch \nguidelines \nby \nact \nof Congress (regardless of whether such amendments have yet to \nbe incorporated by the Sentencing Commission into amendments \nissued under section 994(p) of title 28); and \n(ii) that, except as provided in section 3742(g), are in effect on the \ndate the defendant is sentenced; or \n(B) in the case of a violation of probation or supervised release, the \napplicable guidelines or policy statements issued by the Sentencing \nCommission pursuant to section 994(a)(3) of title 28, United States Code, \ntaking into account any amendments made to such guidelines or policy \nstatements by act of Congress (regardless of whether such amendments \nhave yet to be incorporated by the Sentencing Commission into \namendments issued under section 994(p) of title 28); \n(5) any pertinent policy statement\u2014 \n(A) issued by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to section 994(a)(2) of \ntitle 28, United States Code, subject to any amendments made to such \nAppendix B\n7a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 5 \n \npolicy statement by act of Congress (regardless of whether such \namendments have yet to be incorporated by the Sentencing Commission \ninto amendments issued under section 994(p) of title 28); and \n(B) that, except as provided in section 3742(g), is in effect on the date the \ndefendant is sentenced.  \n(6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with \nsimilar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct; and \n(7) the need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense. \n \nInvoking the italicized language, Esteras claims that \u00a7 3583(c) and (e) create a divide \nbetween permitted and forbidden supervised-release considerations.  As he sees it, a district court \njudge who considers the forbidden factors\u2014\u201cthe seriousness of the offense,\u201d \u201crespect for the \nlaw,\u201d \u201cjust punishment for the offense,\u201d or \u201cthe kinds of sentences available\u201d\u2014necessarily \nimposes a procedurally unreasonable sentence.  Notably, this argument applies to original \nsupervised-release decisions, which come immediately on the heels of any prison-sentence \ndetermination under all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(c), as well as to any \nrevocation, modification, or reduction determinations with respect to supervised release, see id. \n\u00a7 3583(e), (g). \nUnited States v. Lewis rejected this argument.  498 F.3d 393, 399\u2013400 (6th Cir. 2007).  It \nprovided two explanations:  one textual, one contextual.  Textually, Lewis observes that \u00a7 3583 \ngenerally gives courts considerable discretion over supervised-release decisions after considering \nthe listed factors.  Id. at 400.  It never says that the court may consider \u201conly\u201d those factors.  Id.  \nCongress, as it happens, knew how to instruct courts not to consider certain sentencing factors, as \nshown in its express command to disregard the goal of rehabilitation when imposing prison time.  \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(a) (\u201crecognizing that imprisonment is not an appropriate means of promoting \ncorrection or rehabilitation\u201d).   \nIn the context of supervised-release decisions, moreover, Lewis was concerned that this \nproposed bright-line rule was unworkable.  Whether in the context of an initial or later \nsupervised-release \ndecision, \nthe \npurportedly \nforbidden \nconsiderations \nmentioned \nin \n\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) tend to be \u201cessentially redundant\u201d with the permitted ones.  Lewis, 498 F.3d at \n400.  Take \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s consideration about the \u201cseriousness of the offense.\u201d  It aligns with \nAppendix B\n8a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 6 \n \n\u00a7 3553(a)(1) and its emphasis on \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense.\u201d  To think about \nthe one requires the judge to think about the other.   \nOr take \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s consideration of the need \u201cto promote respect for the law.\u201d  It \nmeshes with the rationale that revoking supervised release will \u201chelp\u201d the defendant \u201clearn to \nobey the conditions of his supervised release.\u201d  Id. (quoting Johnson v. United States, 529 U.S. \n694, 709 (2000)).  Indeed, in this case, Judge Pearson quite understandably could not see how \nshe could ignore respect for the law but consider a defendant\u2019s need to respect the terms of \nsupervised release.  To neglect the one dishonors the other. \nOr take \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s reference to \u201cjust punishment for the offense.\u201d  Under \n\u00a7 3553(a)(5), courts must consider \u201cany pertinent policy statement\u201d of the Sentencing \nCommission.  Among other guidance, the Commission tells judges to \u201csanction the violator for \nfailing to abide by the conditions of the court-ordered supervision.\u201d  Id. (quoting U.S.S.G. ch. 7 \npt. A \u00a7 3(b)).  The district court, in other words, must craft a remedy that corresponds to how \nseverely the defendant has breached the court\u2019s trust as \u201cembodied by the original sentence,\u201d \nwhich it cannot do without accounting for the conduct that violated supervised release.  United \nStates v. Johnson, 640 F.3d 195, 204 (6th Cir. 2011).  Another enumerated factor tells a court \nhow to carry out that analysis.  Under \u00a7 3553(a)(4)(B)\u2019s command to consult the Sentencing \nCommission\u2019s supervised-release guidelines, a court first classifies how \u201cserious\u201d these \nviolations are and then uses the categorization to determine the length of any prison sentence.  \nU.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 7B1.1, 7B1.3, 7B1.4. \nEsteras\u2019s bright-line rule is unworkable in another way.  Recall that Congress requires \ncourts to consider the same set of factors when first imposing a term of supervised release as \nwhen revoking one.  18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(c), (e).  Under Esteras\u2019s rule, if Congress forbade district \ncourts from considering anything related to \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) at a revocation hearing, it would not \npermit use of anything related to those factors at an initial sentencing either.  How would this \nwork?  Would the sentencing judge have to adjourn the hearing after imposing a sentence?  \nThen, would she have to start over with a new unblemished inquiry into the right term of \nsupervised release without any consideration, explicitly or implicitly, of considerations related \nto, say, the \u201crule of law\u201d?  Congress could not have expected courts to wipe their minds of these \nAppendix B\n9a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 7 \n \nconcerns when they move from one type of sentence to the other, and nothing in the statute \nrequires such compartmentalization.  If anything, the language points the other way.  It \nspecifically allows courts to account for the length of a supervised-release term \u201cin imposing a \nsentence to a term of imprisonment.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 3583(a).  \nEsteras\u2019s invocation of Tapia v. United States does not change matters.  564 U.S. 319 \n(2011).  It did not, most critically, arise under this statute.  The case dealt with a different \nsentencing law, one with explicit directions, not uncertain implications.  The statute in no \nuncertain \nterms \nsays \n\u201cthat \nimprisonment \nis \nnot \nan \nappropriate \nmeans \nof \npromoting . . . rehabilitation.\u201d  18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(a).  Consistent with that directive, Tapia ruled \nthat the statute precludes courts from considering \u201crehabilitation\u201d when imposing prison time.  \n\u201cOur consideration of Tapia\u2019s claim,\u201d it reasoned, \u201cstarts with the text of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(a)\u2014\nand given the clarity of that provision\u2019s language, could end there as well.\u201d  Tapia, 564 U.S. at \n326. \nIn the course of its analysis, it is true, the Court said in dicta that \u201ca court may not take \naccount of retribution\u201d when it \u201cimpos[es] a term of supervised release.\u201d  Id.  But even taken at \nface value, this reference does not undermine the district court\u2019s sentence.  The provision \nconfirms two things.  First, when the court imposes an initial supervised-release term, retribution \nshould not guide the decision.  No one has shown that Judge Pearson did anything of the sort at \nthat point\u2014and Esteras has not argued otherwise.  Second, if the defendant violates a term of \nsupervised release or commits a new crime, the government is put to a choice.  If it wishes to \nexact retribution for the new offense, new charges and the resulting process that comes with it \nare in order.  Otherwise, the district court should focus on non-retributive factors in deciding the \nnew sentence and the new term of supervised release.  But the district court in this instance did \nnot claim a right to exact retribution for this violation or for that matter use the word.  As shown, \nreferences to other concepts mentioned in \u00a7 3553(a)(2) are hopelessly over-inclusive, and mere \nreferences to things like the \u201crule of law\u201d\u2014or, worse, concepts that overlap with it\u2014do not \ncreate a procedurally unreasonable sentence absent evidence that the court was engaged in \nimposing a purely retributive sentence.  No such evidence exists here.  In fact, Tapia confirms \nthe point.  It ruled for the defendant only after observing that the court\u2019s \u201cnumber one thing \nAppendix B\n10a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 8 \n \n[was] the need to provide treatment\u201d and so may have increased the sentence to ensure Tapia \nwas \u201cin long enough to get the 500 Hour Drug Program.\u201d  Id. at 334 (quotations omitted).  \nThis understanding of \u00a7 3583(e) accords with the analysis of most other circuits and the \noutcomes of all of them.  The general rule is that courts may invoke factors related to the three \ngeneral considerations in \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) without creating a procedurally unreasonable sentence.  \nUnited States v. Vargas-Davila, 649 F.3d 129, 132 (1st Cir. 2011) (\u201cAlthough section 3583(e)(3) \nincorporates by reference, and thus encourages, consideration of certain enumerated subsections \nof section 3553(a), it does not forbid consideration of other pertinent section 3553(a) factors.\u201d); \nUnited States v. Williams, 443 F.3d 35, 48 (2d Cir. 2006) (\u201c[Section] 3583(e) cannot reasonably \nbe interpreted to exclude consideration of the seriousness of the releasee\u2019s violation, given the \nother factors that must be considered.\u201d); United States v. Young, 634 F.3d 233, 240 (3d Cir. \n2011) (\u201c[T]he mere omission of \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) from the mandatory supervised release \nrevocation considerations in \u00a7 3583(e) does not preclude a court from taking [the \n\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors] into account.  To hold otherwise would ignore the reality that the \nviolator\u2019s conduct simply cannot be disregarded in determining the appropriate sanction.\u201d); \nUnited States v. Webb, 738 F.3d 638, 642 (4th Cir. 2013) (\u201c[A]lthough a district court may not \nimpose a revocation sentence based predominantly on [the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors], we conclude \nthat mere reference to such considerations does not render a revocation sentence procedurally \nunreasonable when those factors are relevant to, and considered in conjunction with, the \nenumerated \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d); United States v. Clay, 752 F.3d 1106, 1108\u201309 (7th Cir. 2014) \n(\u201c[T]his subsection may be considered so long as the district court relies primarily on the factors \nlisted in \u00a7 3583(e) . . . .  [T]here is significant overlap between these factors and \n\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A).\u201d); see also United States v. King, 57 F.4th 1334, 1338 n.1 (11th Cir. 2023) \n(acknowledging language in prior cases permitting references to factors that also appear in \n\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)). \nEsteras\u2019s argument, notably, does not even work on its own terms\u2014at least the terms of \nthose circuits that support some of his reasoning.  The circuits that have described the \n\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors as impermissible when used punitively still recognize that they may play \nsupporting roles in a district court\u2019s analysis.  United States v. Sanchez, 900 F.3d 678, 684 n.5 \nAppendix B\n11a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 9 \n \n(5th Cir. 2018) (\u201c[T]his is not to say that any use of words like \u2018punish,\u2019 \u2018serious,\u2019 or \u2018respect\u2019 \nautomatically renders a revocation sentence void.  Mere mention of impermissible factors is \nacceptable; to constitute reversible error, our circuit has said, the forbidden factor must be \n\u2018dominant.\u2019\u201d); United States v. Porter, 974 F.3d 905, 907 (8th Cir. 2020) (\u201cAlthough we have \nlabeled \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) an improper, irrelevant, or \u2018excluded\u2019 factor, we have not declared its \nconsideration an error of law and therefore an abuse of discretion.\u201d); United States v. Simtob, \n485 F.3d 1058, 1063 (9th Cir. 2007) (\u201c[A] district court may properly look to and consider the \nconduct underlying the revocation as one of many acts contributing to the severity of the \nviolator\u2019s breach of trust so as not to preclude a full review of the violator\u2019s history and the \nviolator\u2019s likelihood of repeating that history.\u201d); United States v. Booker, 63 F.4th 1254, 1261\u2013\n62 (10th Cir. 2023) (rejecting the criminal defendant\u2019s appeal in a plain-error setting and noting \nthat it would be problematic to rely on a \u201cdirect quotation to [two] factors that may not be \nconsidered\u201d and as a result issue a \u201cretributive\u201d sentence).  Even under these decisions, Judge \nPearson acted properly when she considered the need to promote respect for \u201cthe rule of law\u201d \nalongside the enumerated \u00a7 3553(a) factors.  This \u201chighly relevant\u201d concern clearly speaks to the \nneed to deter Esteras\u2019s misconduct and protect the public from his disregard of the rule of law, to \nsay nothing of fulfilling the Sentencing Guideline\u2019s commentary on sanctioning Esteras for \nbreaching the court\u2019s trust.  Porter, 974 F.3d at 908\u201309.  All in all, it is highly doubtful that the \noutcome in this case would change under any other circuit\u2019s decision.   \nLast of all, Esteras is concerned that Judge Pearson used the word \u201cpunishment\u201d during \nthe hearing.  But this reference occurred at the beginning of the sentencing phase of the hearing \nand simply set the stage.  In her words, \u201cI find that the new law violation\u201d occurred and that she \nmay \u201cconsider\u201d \u201cevidence\u201d of it \u201cin the punishment I will issue today.\u201d  R.439 at 81.  This \nmanner of speaking at the beginning of a sentencing hearing does not remotely convey an intent \nto impose a retributive sentence in the context of a gun-possession violation that required \n\u201cpunishment\u201d\u2014the revocation of supervised release.  See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(g).  Likewise, when \nthe judge later used the word \u201cpunitive\u201d in describing the conditions of supervised release, R.439 \nat 95, it was to ensure that the sentence was not too long\u2014that the \u201cdeprivation of [Esteras\u2019s] \nliberty\u201d was \u201cno greater . . . than is reasonably necessary for the purposes set forth\u201d in the \nenumerated \u00a7 3553(a)(2) sections, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d)(2).  Surely, shorthand references to \nAppendix B\n12a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 10 \n\u201cpunitive\u201d or \u201cpunishment\u201d in the context of ensuring a sentence is not too long do not convey a \nforbidden focus on retribution.  \nWe AFFIRM the district court\u2019s revocation order. \nAppendix B\n13a\n\nPEARSON, J.\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nNORTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO\nEASTERN DIVISION\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\nPlaintiff,\nv.\nEDGARDO ESTERAS,\nDefendant.\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\nCASE NO.  4:14-CR-425-10\nJUDGE BENITA Y. PEARSON\nORDER\nOn September 6, 2018, Defendant Edgardo Esteras was sentenced to a 12-month term of\nincarceration as to Count 1 of the Indictment for conspiracy to distribute heroin, such term to be\nserved consecutively to the 15-month term of incarceration imposed for the probation violation in\nCase No. 4:11-CR-276-12-DAP, followed by a six-year term of supervised release, with standard\nand special conditions of supervision imposed.  Defendant was further ordered to pay a $100.00\nspecial assessment.  \nFollowing Defendant\u2019s term of incarceration, supervised release commenced on January\n10, 2020.\nOn or about February 20, 2020, the United States Probation Office (\u201cUSPO\u201d) submitted a\nSupervision Report to request a suspension of the GED condition:\nThis report serves to request a suspension of the General Education Diploma (GED)\ncondition.  Before incarceration, Mr. Esteras was diagnosed with an intellectual\ndevelopment disorder indicating difficulty with reading, writing, and comprehension. \nThe undersigned officer has had multiple conversations with Mr. Esteras regarding the\ncondition.  Mr. Esteras has expressed a willingness to work toward obtaining his GED,\nbut disclosed that he has tried and does not think he is capable of comprehending the\nmaterial.\nAppendix C\n14a\n\n(4:14-CR-425-10)\nOn July 20, 2020, the Court ordered suspension of the GED requirement under the\ncircumstances described.\nOn or about September 19, 2022, the USPO issued a Supervision Report to relay a\nrequest from Defendant for early termination of his term of supervised release.  \nOn September 21, 2022, the Court denied Defendant\u2019s request for early termination of\nsupervised release, without prejudice to another request being considered at a later time.\nOn or about January 23, 2023, the USPO issued a Violation Report to notify the Court of\nDefendant\u2019s violation of the terms and conditions of his supervised release:\n-New Criminal Charges (filing is pending with Youngstown Municipal Court)\n-Violent Conduct\n-Whereabouts Unknown (Absconder)\nOn January 23, 2023, at 0003 hours, Officers with the Youngstown Police Department\nwere dispatched to 1137 Inverness Avenue in Youngstown in reference to gunfire.  Upon\narrival, contact was made with the victim, who advised the father of her children,\nEdgardo Esteras, had physically assaulted her and threatened to kill her.  At\napproximately 2350 hours, Mr. Esteras stormed into the residence, struck the victim in\nthe head, punched a television set, and then stormed outside of the residence.  The victim\nfollowed Mr. Edgardo out of the residence who was now inside a vehicle.  The victim\nreached inside the vehicle to grab Mr. Esteras car keys, at which time he produced a\nhandgun and pointed it at the victim and stated, \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you\u201d.  At this time, the\nvictim retreated inside the residence at which time Mr. Esteras fired three rounds into her\nvehicle, an Infiniti JX35, which was located in the driveway of the residence.  Mr. Esteras\nthen fled the scene in a Black Chevy Blazer with an unknown registration. \nOfficers recovered spent 9mm shell casings and observed three bullet holes in the side of\nMI\u2019s vehicle, as well as a broken television set.  The victim refused medical treatment but\ndid advise she wished to file charges of domestic violence against Mr. Esteras.  The\nvictim further advised that Mr. Esteras frequently assaults her, and she has had enough. \nThe Youngstown Police Department is currently pursuing charges of Domestic Violence,\nIllegal Discharge of a Firearm, and Vehicular Vandalism. Formal charges have not been\nofficially filed and Mr. Esteras remains at large as of the time of this report.\nOn January 23, 2023, the Court ordered the issuance of a Warrant for Defendant\u2019s arrest.\n2\nAppendix C\n15a\n\n(4:14-CR-425-10)\nOn or about January 30, 2023, the USPO issued a Follow Up Violation Report to provide\nan update to the Court on Defendant\u2019s violations:\n1.\nNew Law Violation:  On January 23, 2023, Mr. Esteras was charged with\nDomestic Violence (M1), Aggravated Menacing (M1), and Criminal\nDamaging/Endangering (M2) in the Youngstown Municipal Court under case\nnumber 2023CRB00121. \n2.\nPossession of a Firearm:  On January 23, 2023, Mr. Esteras did have in his\npossession or under his control a firearm. \nDefendant was arrested and appeared before Magistrate Judge Amanda M. Knapp on\nJanuary 31, 2023 for an initial appearance.  On February 6, 2023, Magistrate Judge Knapp\nconducted preliminary and detention hearings.  The Court found that probable cause existed for\nthe violations, and additional proceedings would be conducted by the undersigned.  Defendant\nwas remanded to the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service.\nOn or about March 14, 2023, the USPO issued a Supplemental Information Report to\nprovide an update to the Court regarding the status of Defendant\u2019s state charges:\nOn January 22, 2023, Mr. Esteras was charged with Domestic Violence (M1), Aggravated\nMenacing (M1), and Criminal Damaging (M2) in the Youngstown Municipal Court under\ncase number 2023CRB00121Y.  On February 22, 2023, all charges were dismissed at\nrequest of the victim.\nOn April 18, 2023, the Court conducted a Supervised Release Violation Hearing and \nSentencing, at which time Defendant denied Violation Numbers 1 and 2.  Officer Robert\nDiMaiolo testified on direct examination by the Government, with cross examination by the\ndefense.  The Government played a bodycam video (Exhibit 5) of the victim and her family\u2019s\nearly morning interactions with law enforcement officers shortly after the above referenced\n3\nAppendix C\n16a\n\n(4:14-CR-425-10)\ncrimes occurred.1  During those recorded interactions, no one indicated a perpetrator other than\nDefendant.  The alleged victim testified that, after that early morning interaction with law\nenforcement, she went to municipal court and reported Defendant as the perpetrator of the\ncrimes.  Despite the strong evidence against Defendant, the victim attempted (unpersuasively) to\nrecant, when examined on direct examination by defense counsel.  The  Government effectively\ncross examined the victim and submitted Government\u2019s Exhibits 1 through 5, which were\nadmitted without objection.  The Court found by a preponderance of the evidence that Defendant\npossessed a firearm, in violation of the terms of his supervised release, sustaining Violation No.\n2.  The Court proceeded to pronounce sentence after allocution. \nSentencing\nAmong other things, the Court has considered the evidence presented at the violation\nhearing, statutory maximum penalties pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3); the advisory policy\nstatements set forth in Chapter Seven of the United States Sentencing Guidelines; and the\nsuggested range of incarceration pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a).  Furthermore, the Court has\nconsidered the factors and conditions for sentencing listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and 3583(d),\nrespectively.\nBased upon the Court\u2019s review and for the reasons set forth on the record, Defendant\u2019s\nterm of supervised release is revoked.

Esteras \nPage 3 \n \n____________________ \nDISSENT \n____________________ \nKAREN NELSON MOORE, Circuit Judge, dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc.1  \nThe top line of any sentence is generally the term of incarceration.  What catches the eye is how \nlong the defendant will be in prison, not how long the defendant will remain under court \nsupervision.  But in the federal system, supervised release\u2014the often years\u2019 long period of court \nsupervision and restrictions following incarceration\u2014comes with the specter of more time in a \ncell.  Judges may \u201crevoke\u201d a defendant\u2019s supervised release if a defendant violates court-ordered \nconditions, sending the defendant back to prison for months or possibly years.  After Edgardo \nEsteras spent twelve months in federal prison on his original term of incarceration, the judge in \nhis case sentenced him to 24 more months in prison\u2014double his original sentence\u2014for violating \nconditions of supervised release.  R. 439 (Revocation Tr. at 85:13\u201321) (Page ID #2887). \nRevocation of supervised release is immensely impactful, and sometimes carries \nconsequences even greater than an original term of incarceration.  In sentencing Esteras after \nrevoking his supervised release, the district court focused on the retributive purpose of the \nadditional term of incarceration.  See, e.g., id. at 81:17\u201322 (Page ID #2883) (explaining what \ninformation can be considered \u201cin the punishment I will issue today\u201d (emphasis added)); id. at \n83:9\u201311 (Page ID #2885) (\u201c[W]hat\u2019s been done before isn\u2019t sufficient enough to deter you, to \nencourage you to be respectful of the law, to be law-abiding.\u201d (emphasis added)).  But the \nsupervised-release statute tells district courts not to consider punishment as a purpose when \nimposing or revoking supervised release.  When defense counsel objected to the district court\u2019s \n \n1The court received a petition for rehearing en banc concerning the original order in this case, which \nfollowed binding Sixth Circuit precedent.  The petition for rehearing en banc was circulated to the entire court, and \nless than a majority of the judges voted in favor of rehearing the original order en banc.  Following circulation to the \nfull court of the en banc petition, however, the panel revised its prior order and circulated it to the en banc court.  En \nbanc rehearing of the prior order was warranted, which is why I dissent from denial of rehearing en banc.  And en \nbanc rehearing remains warranted now that the panel is issuing an amended order, because that revised decision \nlikewise relies on the same mistaken precedent.  Because both the original and revised orders rely on United States \nv. Lewis, 498 F.3d 393 (6th Cir. 2007), I have addressed both in this dissent from denial of rehearing en banc.  \nEsteras is of course free to petition for en banc rehearing again, now that the panel has filed a revised and published \ndecision. \nAppendix D\n21a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 4 \n \nimpermissible consideration of certain statutory factors embodying retributive purposes, the \ndistrict court confirmed that it relied heavily on \u201cpromot[ing] respect for the law\u201d in reaching its \nsentence, which represented an upward variance.  Id. at 92:16\u201318 (Page ID #2894).  In effect, \nthere is a real chance that Esteras was essentially punished twice, raising concerns of a \nconstitutional dimension and flagrantly violating Congress\u2019s intent in any event.  Our precedent \nthat allows district courts to consider unenumerated sentencing factors when revoking supervised \nrelease, United States v. Lewis, 498 F.3d 393 (6th Cir. 2007), relies on atextual reasoning directly \ncontrary to Congress\u2019s purposes.  It is an outlier among the circuits.  Our failure today to correct \nLewis\u2019s basic mistakes usurps Congress\u2019s role, runs afoul of rudimentary principles of statutory \ninterpretation, and ultimately undermines the purposes of supervised release.  Today\u2019s decision \nin this case serves only to prolong our unfortunate adherence to a mistaken precedent. \nToday\u2019s opinion defends Lewis on two grounds:  \u201cone textual, [and] one contextual.\u201d  \nAmended Order at 5.  Neither ground supports Lewis or today\u2019s decision.  The statutory text is \nclear.  It directs district judges to take account of certain sentencing factors, but not others, when \nrevoking supervised release.  Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e), a court \u201cmay, after considering the \nfactors set forth in section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and \n(a)(7),\u201d terminate, modify, extend, or revoke a defendant\u2019s term of supervised release.  Notably \nabsent from this list is \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), which directs district courts to consider \u201cthe need for the \nsentence imposed . . . to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and \nto provide just punishment for the offense.\u201d  Canons of statutory construction dictate that this \nomission was intentional and command district courts not to take account of the (a)(2)(A) factors \nwhen revoking supervised release.  See, e.g., Leatherman v. Tarrant Cnty. Narcotics Intel. & \nCoordination Unit, 507 U.S. 163, 168 (1993) (declining to extend Rule 9(b)\u2019s pleading \nrequirements to complaints alleging municipal liability because \u201cthe Federal Rules do address in \nRule 9(b) the question of the need for greater particularity in pleading certain actions, but do not \ninclude among the enumerated actions any reference to complaints alleging municipal liability\u201d); \nid. (\u201cExpressio unius est exclusio alterius.\u201d); Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983) \n(\u201c[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in \nanother section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and \nAppendix D\n22a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 5 \n \npurposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\u201d (quoting United States v. Wong Kim Bo, \n472 F.2d 720, 722 (5th Cir. 1972))). \nSimply put, Lewis and today\u2019s opinion offer no explanation for why Congress \ndeliberately chose to include some, but not all, of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in \u00a7 3583(e).  Today\u2019s \nopinion declares that \u00a7 3583 \u201cgenerally gives courts considerable discretion over supervised- \nrelease decisions after considering the listed factors.\u201d  Amended Order at 5 (citing Lewis, \n498 F.3d at 400).  But neither Lewis nor the instant opinion can ground this contention in the \nstatutory text.  Rather, \u00a7 3583(e) explicitly constrains the exercise of discretion, directing district \ncourts to focus on only the enumerated factors.  Had Congress wished for district courts to \nconsider the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors, it would have made \u00a7 3583(e) coterminous with \u00a7 3553(a).  \nCongress did not.  See Azar v. Allina Health Servs., 587 U.S. ----, 139 S. Ct. 1804, 1813 (2019) \n(explaining that courts should not rely on the \u201cdoubtful proposition that Congress sought to \naccomplish in a \u2018surpassingly strange manner\u2019 what it could have accomplished in a much more \nstraightforward way\u201d (quoting RadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC v. Amalgamated Bank, 566 U.S. \n639, 647 (2012))). \nThe context follows from the text.  In Tapia v. United States, the Supreme Court \nexplained that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2013(D) reflects \u201cthe four purposes of sentencing \ngenerally\u201d:  \u201cretribution, deterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation.\u201d  564 U.S. 319, 325 \n(2011).  The statute\u2019s \u201cprovisions make clear that a particular purpose may apply differently, or \neven not at all, depending on the kind of sentence under consideration.\u201d  Id. at 326.  Following \nthe statute\u2019s plain text, \u201ca court may not take account of retribution (the first purpose listed in \n\u00a7 3553(a)(2)) when imposing a term of supervised release.\u201d  Id.  Section \u00a7 3583(e), which \npertains to revoking supervised release, is the mirror-image of \u00a7 3583(c), which pertains to \nimposing a term of supervised release.  It follows that both subsections direct district courts not \nto consider retribution when imposing or revoking supervised release. \nFaced with this obvious hurdle, today\u2019s decision attempts to rewrite Tapia.  Of course, \nI need not put much gloss on what Justice Kagan straightforwardly said in that opinion:  a district \ncourt cannot rely on the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors when making decisions concerning supervised \nrelease.  Tapia, 564 U.S. at 326.  Today\u2019s decision attempts to skirt this plain statement through \nAppendix D\n23a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 6 \n \ntwo paragraphs of explanation of what Justice Kagan supposedly must have meant.  I, like \nJustice Kagan, prefer to rely on the actual text of the statute.  In any event, today\u2019s attempt to \nsquare what the district court did with Tapia is futile.  For one, today\u2019s opinion gets its facts \nwrong.  It says in conclusory words that no one has shown that the district judge let retribution \nguide the decision.  Amended Order at 7.  Most obviously, Esteras has.  Pet. Rehearing En Banc \nat 10 (\u201cThe district court expressly relied on the section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors\u2014specifically, the \nneed to punish and to promote respect for the law\u2014when revoking Esteras\u2019 supervised release.\u201d \n(emphasis added)).  And this assertion of the panel is belied by the plain words the district court \nused in the proceeding, which sounded in retribution.  Like its take on Tapia, today\u2019s decision \nwould rather reconceptualize the very words the district court used\u2014\u201cpunishment\u201d and \n\u201cpunitive\u201d\u2014and chalk them up to \u201cset[ting] the stage\u201d rather than an error on the part of the \ndistrict court.  Of course, \u201csetting the stage\u201d by thinking of the sentence in terms of punishment \nis precisely what a district court must not do per the text of the statute.  To the extent that Tapia \nexplains that taking the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors into account necessarily means taking retribution \ninto account, today\u2019s decision\u2019s myopic focus on a word here or there entirely misses the point. \nTapia is also instructive on statute-drafting more broadly.  But once again, today\u2019s \ndecision would rather ignore its clear import.  Today\u2019s decision suggests that unless Congress \nenacts a separate statutory provision forbidding district courts to take account of certain factors, \nas it did in \u00a7 3582(a), the purposeful omissions in \u00a7 3583(c) and (e) are meaningless.  Yet \nCongress can accomplish its statutory purposes in a variety of ways, as Tapia recognizes.  Again, \nthe only understanding of \u00a7 3583(e) that gives effect to its plain text is that explained by Tapia. \nThat retributive concerns are not to be taken into account reflects Congress\u2019s judgment of \nthe purpose of supervised release.  The relevant legislative history explicitly states that \u201cthe \nsentencing purposes of incapacitation and punishment would not be served by a term of \nsupervised release\u2014that the primary goal of such a term is to ease the defendant\u2019s transition into \nthe community.\u201d  S. Rep. No. 98-225, at *124 (1983); see also Johnson v. United States, \n529 U.S. 694, 708\u201309 (2000) (citing the Senate Report and discussing the purpose of supervised \nrelease).  By contrast, taking the retributive \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors into account when imposing \nor revoking supervised release contravenes this congressional purpose and also creates \u201cserious \nAppendix D\n24a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 7 \n \nconstitutional questions . . . by construing revocation and reimprisonment as punishment for the \nviolation of the conditions of supervised release.\u201d  Johnson, 529 U.S. at 700.  The Sentencing \nGuidelines confirm this understanding:  revocation of supervised release is not meant to \n\u201csubstantially duplicate the sanctioning role of the court with jurisdiction over a defendant\u2019s new \ncriminal conduct,\u201d but instead to \u201csanction primarily the defendant\u2019s breach of trust.\u201d  U.S. \nSent\u2019g Guidelines Manual Ch. 7A Intro. (U.S. Sent\u2019g Comm\u2019n 2023). \nNo doubt, there is some level of overlap between the factors district courts must consider \nwhen revoking supervised release, and those that a district court cannot consider.  See Lewis, 498 \nF. 3d at 400 (explaining that a district court likely takes into account the seriousness of an \noffense when considering the nature and circumstances of the offense).  But today\u2019s opinion \ntreats this reality\u2014that there is some degree of overlap\u2014as a virtue, manifestly dishonoring \nCongress\u2019s decision to omit the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors from consideration.  Amended Order at \n6 (\u201cTo think about the one requires the judge to think about the other.\u201d); id. (\u201cTo neglect the one \ndishonors the other.\u201d).  That a district court may consider, to some degree, the seriousness of the \noffense, however, does not justify allowing district courts to disregard Congress\u2019s mandate that \nretributive concerns should not influence the overall sentence.  Put differently, the overlap \nproblem first identified by Lewis is exaggerated to the extent that a district court can avoid \nrunning afoul of the statute by avoiding viewing revocation of supervised release as retribution. \nPerhaps recognizing the futility of any text-based argument, today\u2019s decision reinvents \nthe overlap argument in the form of a strawman.  It suggests that Congress cannot possibly have \nmeant that district courts should not rely on the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors when revoking \nsupervised release, because \u201cCongress requires courts to consider the same set of factors when \nfirst imposing a term of supervised release as when revoking one.\u201d  Amended Order at 6.  Per \ntoday\u2019s decision, district courts would be forced to \u201cadjourn the hearing after imposing a[n] \n[initial] sentence\u201d and \u201cstart over with a new unblemished inquiry into the right term of \nsupervised release\u201d so as to not mistakenly consider the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors.  Id.  This \nargument is disingenuous.  What the statute requires is that district courts not view supervised \nrelease as an additional punishment, and that district courts adjust their rationale and \nAppendix D\n25a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 8 \n \nconsiderations accordingly when imposing or revoking supervised release.  The district court \nmanifestly failed to do that here. \nWhat is more, some degree of overlap cannot explain away Congress\u2019s explicit choice to \nomit certain sentencing factors from consideration when revoking supervised release.  In this \nway, the analyses of Lewis and today\u2019s opinion are self-defeating.  If Congress believed that \ncourts would inevitably consider the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors when revoking supervised release, \nit would not have omitted such factors from \u00a7 3583.  Lewis, 498 F.3d at 400.  The same is true if \nCongress affirmatively wanted district courts to consider such factors.  Id. at 399\u2013400.  \nRegardless, bare judicial pragmatism cannot overcome the plain text of the statute, which directs \ndistrict courts not to take retributive sentencing factors into account.  United States v. Tohono \nO\u2019Odham Nation, 563 U.S. 307, 317 (2011) (\u201c[C]onsiderations of policy divorced from the \nstatute\u2019s text and purpose could not override its meaning.\u201d). \nBeyond these fundamental errors, en banc reconsideration is warranted because the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s approach is an outlier among the circuit courts.  Lewis and today\u2019s opinion are entirely \nuntethered from the statutory text, and it would appear that they allow a district court to rely \nexclusively on the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors when revoking supervised release.  Lewis, 498 F.3d at \n399\u2013400 (holding \u201cthat it does not constitute reversible error to consider \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) when \nimposing a sentence for violation of supervised release, even though this factor is not \nenumerated in \u00a7 3583(e)\u201d).  In other words, our cases contain no limits and allow district courts \nto disregard \u00a7 3583(e) in toto.  Though there is a circuit split on this issue, most circuits would \nfind that a revocation of supervised release principally based on the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors is \nprocedurally unreasonable.  See, e.g., United States v. Booker, 63 F.4th 1254, 1260 (10th Cir. \n2023) (\u201c[I]t is procedural error to consider an unenumerated [\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)] factor.\u201d); United \nStates v. Miqbel, 444 F.3d 1173, 1182\u201383 (9th Cir. 2006) (holding that \u201cmere reference\u201d to \nunenumerated \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors would not be reversible error, but that further \nconsideration of such factors when revoking supervised release is procedurally unreasonable); \nUnited States v. Rivera, 784 F.3d 1012, 1017 (5th Cir. 2015) (\u201c[A] sentencing error occurs when \nan impermissible consideration is a dominant factor in the court\u2019s revocation sentence.\u201d); United \nStates v. Young, 634 F.3d 233, 241 (3rd Cir. 2011) (recognizing that consideration of \nAppendix D\n26a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v. Esteras \nPage 9 \n \nunenumerated \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors would not be reversible per se error, but that \u201cthere may \nbe a case where a court places undue weight on the\u201d \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors); United States v. \nWebb, 738 F.3d 638, 642 (4th Cir. 2013) (\u201c[A]lthough a district court may not impose a \nrevocation sentence based predominately on the [\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors], we conclude that \nmere reference to such considerations does not render a revocation sentence procedurally \nunreasonable.\u201d); United States v. Clay, 752 F.3d 1106, 1108 (7th Cir. 2014) (\u201c[W]e now join the \nmajority of circuits that have faced this issue and rule that this subsection [\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)] may \nbe considered so long as the district court relies primarily on [enumerated] factors.\u201d (emphasis \nadded)).  Lewis appears expressly to adopt punishment as a valid rationale for revoking \nsupervised release, directly contrary to the statute and Congress\u2019s intent.  498 F.3d at 400 \n(\u201c[A]lthough violations of supervised release generally do not entail conduct as serious as crimes \npunishable under the \u00a7 3553(a) regime, revocation sentences are similarly intended to \u2018sanction,\u2019 \nor, analogously, to \u2018provide just punishment for the offense\u2019 of violating supervised release.\u201d). \nLewis and today\u2019s decision bulldoze over each and every indication of congressional \nintent available in favor of an explicitly policy-driven outcome.  That includes plain text, \nlegislative history, and information from the Sentencing Commission.  \u201c[D]eference to the \nsupremacy of the Legislature, as well as recognition that Congress[members] typically vote on \nthe language of a bill, generally requires us to assume that \u2018the legislative purpose is expressed \nby the ordinary meaning of the words used.\u2019\u201d  United States v. Locke, 471 U.S. 84, 95 (1985) \n(quoting Richards v. United States, 369 U.S. 1, 9 (1962)).  Here, this deference requires that \ndistrict courts honor Congress\u2019s explicit choice that supervised release not be an additional \npunishment, and that district courts adjust their rationale and considerations accordingly.  The \ndistrict court failed to do that here.  It plainly viewed revocation of supervised release as \npunishment, and sentenced Esteras to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment based on impermissible \nsentencing factors.

Because our precedent mistakenly allows a district court to do so, I respectfully \ndissent from the denial of rehearing en banc in this case. \n \n \nAppendix D\n27a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v.

The original panel has reviewed the \npetition for rehearing and concludes that the issues raised in the petition were fully considered \nupon the original submission and decision.  The petition then was circulated to the full court.  \nLess than a majority of the judges voted in favor of rehearing en banc. \n \nTherefore, the petition is denied. \n \n \nAppendix E\n31a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v.

United States v. Esteras, 88 F.4th 1170, 1171\u201376 (6th Cir. 2023) \n(Moore, J., dissenting).  I would grant the current petition for rehearing because United States v. \nLewis, 498 F.3d 393 (6th Cir. 2007), and the amended panel order in this case contravene the \nstatutory text, disregard Supreme Court precedent, and place the Sixth Circuit at the extreme of a \ncircuit split, allowing our district courts expressly to punish defendants for violations of \nsupervised release.  Esteras, 88 F.4th at 1171\u201375 (Moore, J., dissenting).  Judge Griffin rightly \nflags the severe consequences that our precedents create for the hundreds of individuals who face \nrevocations of supervised release each year, and correctly points out that these consequences and \nthe shaky foundation of our precedents mean that Esteras\u2019s petition raises questions of \nexceptional importance.  En banc rehearing remains warranted for all of these reasons. \n \n \nAppendix E\n32a\n\nNo. 23-3422 \nUnited States v.

UPHOLD, RDR, CRR         (330) 884-7424\n81\nchange her story.  But only enough to make her appear \nconfused.  Nothing she said that was of significance while \nunder oath persuades me to believe that you did not possess \nthe weapon, that you did not point it at that household, \nthat you did not discharge it at least three times.  \nNow, regarding the new law violation, I wish I \nwere better versed in the ordinances, regulations, the \nactual law of Youngstown, knowing its elements.  I suspect \nthat your behavior at targeting the house with a weapon and \nactually assaulting the car with at least three bullets, the \ncasing of one which was found in the driveway, match the \nelements.  But I just don't know.  And it really doesn't \nmatter.  Because as I told counsel at the beginning of the \nhearing, both are Grade C violations.  You are subject to \nthe same penalties regardless of whether I find that you \nviolated your term of supervised release in one or two ways.  \nSo I find that the new law violation and \nMs. Infante's corroboration of it by presenting herself at \nYoungstown Municipal Court the next day is evidence that I \ncan consider in the punishment I will issue today.  But I \nfind explicitly that you violated your term of supervision \nby possessing a weapon.  \nI will allow you to allocute now, and then I will \nrespond by imposing consequences.  You have the opportunity \nto speak if you would like to be heard. \nAppendix F\n37a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n17:09:53\n17:10:06\n17:10:33\n17:10:47\n17:11:06\nMARY L. UPHOLD, RDR, CRR         (330) 884-7424\n82\n(Discussion held off the record between the defendant \nand Mr. Grostic.)  \nTHE DEFENDANT:  I really ain't got -- I ain't got \nthat much to say.  If -- it's -- I don't.  \nTHE COURT:  You choose not to allocute?\nTHE DEFENDANT:  What can I say if you -- I just \ndon't.  \nMR. GROSTIC:  Okay.  If I could have one moment, \nYour Honor.  \nTHE COURT:  Certainly. \n(Discussion held off the record between the defendant \nand Mr. Grostic.)  \nMR. GROSTIC:  Your Honor, after discussion, which \nI appreciate the Court's indulging me, Mr. Esteras has \nconfirmed with me that he does not want to say anything \nfurther. \nTHE COURT:  Certainly.  \nThat's fine, Mr. Esteras.  You've been before a \nfederal judge at least three times facing a sentencing.  The \nfirst time was my colleague, Judge Polster.  The last time \nwas me.  This time is also me meting out a sentence.  \nSo I understand that you understand the right you \nhave and the right you give up.  You have been under a term \nof supervised release at least twice.  When I imposed \nsentence upon you the last time, I sentenced you for the \nAppendix F\n38a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n17:11:25\n17:11:45\n17:11:59\n17:12:20\n17:12:34\nMARY L. UPHOLD, RDR, CRR         (330) 884-7424\n83\ncommission of the crime that was on my docket, conspiracy to \ndistribute heroin, and I also sentenced you for the \nviolation of the earlier term of supervision imposed that \nyou were under when you were indicted in the new case then \non my docket, and that was possession with intent -- \nconspiracy to possess with intent cocaine and cocaine base.  \nSo you are no stranger to law violations and no \nstranger to federal court.  My worry for you, sir, is that \nwhat's been done before isn't sufficient enough to deter \nyou, to encourage you to be respectful of the law, to be \nlaw-abiding.  \nEven things I heard in the video that were \nrepeated today, it appears that you assault that household \nregularly.  That you argue in a violent way with Ms. Infante \nregularly.  I am not really sure what it will require for \nyou to learn that enough is enough.  You were given \nprobation by Judge Polster.  I imposed two rather lenient \nsentences, 15 months on that term of supervision violation \nfor Judge Polster; for my own case, 12 months.  I ran them \nconsecutively.  I thought 27 months might encourage you to \ndo better.  \nIt was with some reluctance, a great deal \nactually, that I even suspended the GED qualification, \nthinking that perhaps if you were to become better educated, \nprove to yourself and others that you can read and write at \nAppendix F\n39a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n17:12:49\n17:13:10\n17:13:26\n17:13:45\n17:14:00\nMARY L. UPHOLD, RDR, CRR         (330) 884-7424\n84\nat least a high school level, you might begin to see \nyourself as something other than a law violator, someone who \nhits women, someone who disturbs children in the middle of \nthe night.  \nMy reading of the police report is that Officer \nDiMaiolo was at that household at about 3:28 a.m. on a \nschool night.  Late January.  Vacation is over.  There were \nschool-aged persons in that video, and yet they were \nawake -- not all of them were school-aged, of course -- \nbecause you had assaulted the car and the household with \nyour intentions and broken the TV.  \nOne of the youngsters said, \"I was scared.  Now I \ncan't watch TV.\"  That might seem insignificant to you, but \nchildren shouldn't grow up afraid of what their father or \ntheir mother's boyfriend might do to them at night.  \nWhen I consider the guidance given to us by \nOfficer Zakrajsek that I've confirmed with you, is not \nobjected to, and in my opinion is correct, you are subject, \npursuant to the advisory guidelines, to 6 to 12 months.  We \nknow that your offense that's brought you here on my docket \ncarries a lifetime of supervision.  \nHaving found that you are in violation of that \nterm of supervised release by the preponderance of the \nevidence, I must escalate the consequences imposed.  And I \ndo here impose escalated consequences by exercising my \nAppendix F\n40a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n17:14:21\n17:14:38\n17:14:54\n17:15:15\n17:15:31\nMARY L. UPHOLD, RDR, CRR         (330) 884-7424\n85\ndiscretion to vary upwards, above even the high end of the \nadvisory guidelines, because your behavior is not average, \nit's not typical, it's not mine run, it's exceptional.  It's \ndisrespectful.  It's dangerous.  And it must stop.  \nAnd if you cannot stop yourself, I will separate \nyou from society for long enough to at least allow you to \nreconsider your behavior.  And hopefully when you return \nunder the new term of supervision that I will impose, you \nwill do better.  You will think before you act.  And you \nwill understand that never possessing a weapon or dangerous \ndevice or a single bullet is meant for you for the rest of \nyour natural life.  \nPlease listen as I formally impose consequences.  \nI revoke your term of supervised release.  I \nhereby impose a term of incarceration of 24 months.  A new \nterm of supervised release of three years.  Every term of \nsupervised release that I imposed earlier, the last time I \nsentenced you in September of 2018, is reimposed unless it's \nbeen met.  For instance, I don't require you to obtain a GED \nagain.  If you've paid your special assessment, that's \nsatisfied.  \nBut every other term, including substance abuse \ntreatment and testing, a search and seizure provision, \nmental health treatment are the ones I am listing simply \nbecause I believe they have likely not been met.  And if -- \nAppendix F\n41a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n17:15:48\n17:16:01\n17:16:17\n17:16:34\n17:16:44\nMARY L. UPHOLD, RDR, CRR         (330) 884-7424\n86\nI mean, likely are those that are capable of being repeated \nand shall be repeated.  \nAnd I am adding a new one.  I am adding, for the \nfirst six months of your release -- keep in mind, I can \nincarcerate you for up to three years.  I have stopped at 24 \nmonths.  But once you're released to start this new \nthree-year term of supervised release, for the first six \nmonths, you are going to be on location monitoring with a \ncurfew.  \nMr. Zakrajsek, Mr. Esteras goes nowhere without \nthe explicit permission of his supervising probation \nofficer.  He shall only live at a place approved by the \nprobation office.  Make sure there are no weapons there.  If \nhe's unable to find such a place, then he'll start his term \nof release by living in a residential reentry center until \nhe has enough money to pay his own rent and live in a place \nthat is suitable.  \nI order that this curfew allow him to work, to \nattend to medical appointments as necessary, and to only be \nin the presence of the victim and the minor children who \nlive with him with the permission of the supervising \nprobation officer.  \nIs all of that clear, Mr. Esteras?\nTHE DEFENDANT:  Yes, Your Honor.  \nTHE COURT:  Sir, I have revoked your term of \nAppendix F\n42a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n17:17:00\n17:17:13\n17:17:22\n17:17:39\n17:17:54\nMARY L. UPHOLD, RDR, CRR         (330) 884-7424\n87\nsupervised release.  You have a new term -- a new ability to \nappeal the sentence that I have imposed.  There is still the \nlimit.  You've heard this before.  It remains 14 days from \nthe date on which I reduce to writing the sentence I've \nimposed.  If you allow that 14-day period to go by without \nfiling a notice of appeal, you may have forever waived your \nappellate rights.  \nMr. Grostic, will you speak with your client about \nhis appellate rights?  \nMR. GROSTIC:  Yes, Your Honor. \nTHE COURT:  Should he ask you to do so, will you \ntimely file a notice of appeal for him?  \nMR. GROSTIC:  Yes, Your Honor. \nTHE COURT:  You should know, Mr. Esteras, as you \nlikely do, if you cannot afford counsel, just like you do \nnot pay Mr. Grostic or his office, counsel will be appointed \nto represent you free of charge.  So that should not be the \nreason you don't timely file a notice of appeal.  \nDo you understand that?\nTHE DEFENDANT:  (Nodding head up and down.) \nYes, Your Honor. \nTHE COURT:  Mr. Zakrajsek, you have heard me \nreimpose conditions that are obviously not completed and are \ncapable of being repeated, and I believe will be of \nassistance to Mr. Esteras when he returns to the community.  \nAppendix F\n43a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n17:18:05\n17:18:19\n17:18:35\n17:18:55\n17:19:04\nMARY L. UPHOLD, RDR, CRR         (330) 884-7424\n88\nAnd I have added six months of location monitoring with a \ncurfew.  \nIs there anything else you'd like me to consider \nat this time?  \nOFFICER ZAKRAJSEK:  Your Honor, I would like to \npetition the Court to consider possibly an anger management \nprogram as well due to his anger issues.  \nTHE COURT:  Thank you.  I think that's an \nexcellent suggestion.  \nSo in the past, Mr. Esteras, I have ordered that \nyou be subjected to mental health treatment.  I am ordering \nthat again.  It will start with an evaluation.  Part of the \ntreatment you'll undergo after that evaluation will be anger \nmanagement.  \nIf you do behave in the way that the violation \nthat's brought you to court seems to indicate is a regular \noccurrence, you must learn to control yourself or you are \nlikely going to do something that is going to separate you \nfrom society for a much longer period than just 24 months.  \nSo I do impose, as a component of mental health, \nanger management.  \nWhat else, Mr. Zakrajsek?  \nOFFICER ZAKRAJSEK:  Nothing further, Your Honor.  \nThank you.  \nTHE COURT:  Thank you for your work in this case.  \nAppendix F\n44a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n17:19:23\n17:19:35\n17:19:52\n17:20:04\n17:20:19\nMARY L.

JOYCE:  Your Honor, I believe the conditions \nthat you have outlined here, with the addition from -- the \nadditional recommend by Mr. Zakrajsek are appropriate, and I \nwould offer nothing additional.  Thank you.  \nTHE COURT:  Your objection to the sentence \nimposed, Government's Counsel.  \nMR. JOYCE:  I have no objection, Your Honor.  \nTHE COURT:  Mr. Grostic, why don't I start by \nasking you what you think I can do to improve the conditions \nof supervised release.  Of course, all of the mandatory, \nstandard, and the conditions I've just outlined are those \nthat fall under special conditions.  \nMR. GROSTIC:  (Nodding head up and down.)  \nTHE COURT:  Thank you for nodding that you \nunderstood that.  If there are any others that you believe I \nshould impose that will assist your client or impose in a \ndifferent way, like Mr. Zakrajsek suggested regarding \nrefining mental health, it's not limited to anger \nmanagement, but that's now a specific component, is there \nanything else you'd suggest?  \nMR. GROSTIC:  I don't believe so, Your Honor, as \nfar as conditions of supervised release.  \nAppendix F\n45a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n17:20:32\n17:20:43\n17:21:01\n17:21:14\n17:21:20\nMARY L.

GROSTIC:  Yes.  \nTHE COURT:  I will make that recommendation.  \nWhere were you housed during your last term of \nincarceration, Mr. Esteras?\nTHE DEFENDANT:  Hazelton. \nTHE COURT:  Hazelton.  I don't know what the \npolicy of the Bureau of Prisons is regarding sending you \nback to a place where you've been.  If there is no \nprohibition, if they were to send you back to Hazelton, is \nthat something you'd like me to ask for, or would you rather \nsomething even closer to home, such as Elkton? \nTHE DEFENDANT:  Yeah, closer to home. \nTHE COURT:  More like Elkton than Hazelton?\nTHE DEFENDANT:  Yes, ma'am. \nTHE COURT:  All right.  I will make that \nrecommendation.  \nWhat else?  What other recommendations, if there \nare any, Mr. Grostic?  \nMR. GROSTIC:  May I have one moment, Your Honor?  \nTHE COURT:  Certainly. \n(Discussion held off the record between the defendant \nAppendix F\n46a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n17:21:41\n17:21:57\n17:22:17\n17:22:31\n17:22:44\nMARY L.

GROSTIC:  Your Honor, Mr. Esteras would also \nrequest that the Court recommend that he be evaluated for \nplacement in any applicable drug treatment program, as well \nas any applicable behavioral management or mental health \ntreatment program for which he might qualify. \nTHE COURT:  Thank you.  I will make both of those \nrecommendations as well.  \nMy belief, Mr. Esteras, is that a 24-month term, \nwhile longer than one you would like, I'm sure, is not long \nenough for the most intensive drug treatment program, but I \nam sure there are others that may be helpful to you.  And I \nhope that along with my recommendation, you will sign up and \napply yourself to any programs that you're admitted.  And I \nwill recommend those for behavioral management and drug \ntreatment.  \nWhat else, if anything else?  I am open to \nadopting whatever you recommend if it will help Mr. Esteras.  \nMR. GROSTIC:  No, nothing further, Your Honor.  \nThank you.  \nTHE COURT:  Your objection to the sentence imposed \non behalf of your client, Mr. Grostic.  \nMR. GROSTIC:  Your Honor, I believe the Court \nindicated that it considered factors -- the factor in \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A) as part of its sentence.  I have \nAppendix F\n47a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n17:23:12\n17:23:31\n17:23:44\n17:24:05\n17:24:27\nMARY L. UPHOLD, RDR, CRR         (330) 884-7424\n92\nobjected to that in the past.  I am aware that actually the \nSixth Circuit has held that that is something the Court can \nconsider, but I would simply like to lodge that objection \nfor the record.  \nTHE COURT:  Mr. Grostic, when you specify Section \n3553(a)(2)(A), are you referring to underneath -- (2) is the \nneed for the sentence to be imposed, correct?  You are \nspecifically objecting to, \"to reflect the seriousness of \nthe offense, to promote respect for the law, and provide \njust punishment for the offense,\" that's what you're \ndirecting your objection to?  \nMR. GROSTIC:  That's correct, Your Honor. \nTHE COURT:  To any one of those three subfactors \nor all of them? \nMR. GROSTIC:  All of them, yes.  \nTHE COURT:  Well, I would agree with you, part of \nmy contemplation certainly is the need for the sentence \nimposed, to promote respect for the law.  I mentioned \ndeterring Mr. Esteras as well.  I also meant, and I think \nit's fair for you to infer, concern about the safety of the \ncommunity, which is later beyond (a)(2).  And I specifically \nreferenced the ability even to depart or, pardon me, vary \nupwards to separate Mr. Esteras from the average, typical, \nmine run-type defendant.  \nSo I think I have sufficiently addressed what your \nAppendix F\n48a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n17:24:45\n17:25:06\n17:25:26\n17:25:42\n17:26:00\nMARY L. UPHOLD, RDR, CRR         (330) 884-7424\n93\nobjection is, and you are entitled to it.  \nI will add just one other point.  If it enlarges \nyour objection, you will be able to tell me.  \nWhen I told counsel earlier that this is a 104(a) \nhearing, under the rules of evidence, that they're \nsuspended, I still, being a student of the rules of \nevidence, it is hard to put them out of your mind.  And even \nthough I am not obligated to explicitly make calls on \nmatters, objections, sustain, overrule them, I still try to \nhew closely to considering evidence in a way that makes \nsense when the rules of evidence are considered.  \nAnd I want the record to reflect that when I did \nthat, and I suspect Mr. Grostic might have been doing this \nas well, I kept in mind Rule of Evidence 803.  Rule of \nEvidence 803 is one of those rules that outlines exceptions \nto the rules against hearsay, and it explicitly says, \n\"Regardless of whether a declarant is available as a \nwitness, Judge, you can consider certain things.\"  \nAnd these are things that are well established to \nbe truthful, or more likely than not, I should say, to be \ntruthful, credible.  And they include present sense \nimpressions, statements made while explaining an event or \ncondition, those statements made immediately after the \ndeclarant perceived it.  \nSo like those statements, Mr. Esteras, that \nAppendix F\n49a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n17:26:18\n17:26:36\n17:26:54\n17:27:11\n17:27:33\nMARY L. UPHOLD, RDR, CRR         (330) 884-7424\n94\nMs. Infante made as soon as Officer DiMaiolo showed up, I \nconsidered, because I believe, as Mr. Joyce said, she was \nher most credible at those moments.  \n\"Excited utterance, a statement relating to a \nstartling event or condition made while the declarant was \nunder the stress of the excitement that it caused.\"  \nThose folks in that house, the youngster, the \nwoman with the box braids, the two young women who were \nstanding on either side of Ms. Infante, one of whom was the \none who said, \"I was scared.  I can't watch TV.\"  The other \nsaid, \"Why he point a gun at us?\"  I considered those \nexcited utterances and found them to be credible.  \n\"Then existing mental, emotional, or physical \ncondition\" is another one of those categories that has sort \nof a threshold, a built-in credibility.  I don't have to \naccept them, but I use that as a way to cabin what I was \nhearing on the witness stand compared to what I had heard in \nthat video.  \nSo I used those things, Mr. Grostic.  And I think \nthat was part of the argument made by Mr. Joyce to \ncorroborate what I heard on the video and to discredit what \nI heard from Ms. Infante during most of her testimony.  \nThere were nuggets of truth, very few of them.  Most of the \ntime she made up answers purposefully to distinguish today's \ntestimony from what we saw in the video.  \nAppendix F\n50a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n17:27:42\n17:27:58\n17:28:12\n17:28:24\n17:28:42\nMARY L.

GROSTIC:  No, nothing further, Your Honor.  \nThank you.  \nTHE COURT:  Thank you.  \nThank you for the work you've done, Counselors, in \nmaking a full record.  \nMr. Esteras, I meant it when I said earlier that I \nam proud of you for earning your GED.  That told me, even \nafter you knew you were not obligated to do it, you \npersisted and you did it.  \nMy hope is you'll give some thoughts to your \ncondition, your own circumstances, your role in these \nconditions and circumstances, and you will continue despite \nwhat you think anyone thinks about you, go forward, improve \nyourself and have a better life.

But my hope is you'll go \nforward.  The three years of supervised release won't only \nbe punitive.

Dustin, Dexter Phillips, \nUNITED STATES ATTORNEY\u2019S OFFICE, Toledo, Ohio, for Appellee. \n_________________ \nOPINION \n_________________ \nTHAPAR, Circuit Judge.  Timothy Jaimez pled guilty to federal drug charges.  After his \nsecond supervised-release violation, the district court sentenced him to sixty months\u2019 \nimprisonment.  Because that sentence is procedurally and substantively reasonable, we affirm.  \n>\nAppendix G\n53a\n\nNo. 23-3189 \nUnited States v. Jaimez \nPage 2 \n \n \nI. \n \nTimothy Jaimez pled guilty to conspiring to possess narcotics with the intent to distribute \nthem.  After serving time in prison, he began a term of supervised release.  While on release, \nJaimez used drugs, failed to maintain employment, and failed to truthfully disclose financial \ninformation to his probation officer.  So a court revoked his release.   \n \nWhen Jaimez began a second term of supervised release, his behavior didn\u2019t improve.  \nPolice found him transporting marijuana in his car with the co-felons from his original \nconviction.  And at Jaimez\u2019s properties, police found cocaine base, a shell casing, and a drug \npress.  Based on this conduct, an Ohio court found Jaimez guilty of attempting to traffic \nmarijuana.   \n \nThe United States then sought to revoke Jaimez\u2019s release.  It alleged three violations:  \n(1) being charged with a new crime, (2) associating with known felons, and (3) possessing drug \nparaphernalia.  In line with probation\u2019s report, the court classified Jaimez\u2019s first violation as \n\u201cGrade A\u201d under the Sentencing Guidelines.  See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.1(a)(1).  That carried a \nsentencing range of fifty-one to sixty months\u2019 incarceration.  See id. \u00a7 7B1.4(a); 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 3583(e)(3).  Over Jaimez\u2019s objection, the district court sentenced him to sixty months\u2019 \nincarceration, followed by six years of supervised release.   \nII. \nJaimez now appeals, claiming his sentence is procedurally and substantively \nunreasonable.  Applying an abuse-of-discretion standard, we conclude that it\u2019s neither.  See \nUnited States v. Adams, 873 F.3d 512, 516\u201317 (6th Cir. 2017). \nA. \n \nJaimez first challenges his sentence\u2019s procedural reasonableness.  He argues the court \n(1) inadequately explained his sentence, (2) improperly considered section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors, \nand (3) incorrectly classified his release violation as Grade A.  Jaimez is wrong on all three \ncounts.  \nAppendix G\n54a\n\nNo. 23-3189 \nUnited States v. Jaimez \nPage 3 \n \n \n \nAdequate Explanation.  A court need not \u201cengage in a ritualistic incantation\u201d of statutory \nsentencing factors.  United States v. Chandler, 419 F.3d 484, 488 (6th Cir. 2005) (citation \nomitted).  Nor must a court explicitly address every factor.  United States v. Collington, 461 F.3d \n805, 809 (6th Cir. 2006).  Rather, the record needs to show only that the court considered the \napplicable factors.  United States v. McBride, 434 F.3d 470, 474 (6th Cir. 2006).   \nJaimez\u2019s sentencing passes this very easy test.  During sentencing, the court discussed \nJaimez\u2019s Guidelines range with the parties.  See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(4)(B), 3583(e).  The court \nreferenced Jaimez\u2019s criminal history and previous release violations.  See id. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(1), \n3583(e).  The court also sought to deter Jaimez and others from violating release conditions.  See \nid. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B), 3583(e).  And the court recognized a need to promote respect for the law \nand protect the public.  See id. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), (C), 3583(e); see also United States v. Lewis, \n498 F.3d 393, 399 (6th Cir. 2007).  Given this record, it\u2019s clear the court considered the federal \nsentencing factors. \n \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A) Factors.  Jaimez next takes issue with the factors the court did \nexpressly consider:  the seriousness of his offense, the promotion of respect for the law, and the \nprovision of just punishment.  Jaimez argues the court shouldn\u2019t have considered these factors \nbecause the statute governing revocation doesn\u2019t require it.  See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e).  But we\u2019ve \nmade clear that district courts may nonetheless consider these factors when imposing revocation \nsentences.  See Lewis, 498 F.3d at 399\u2013400; United States v. Esteras, 88 F.4th 1163, 1167\u201370 \n(6th Cir. 2023), reh\u2019g en banc denied, --- F.4th ----, 2024 WL 981140 (6th Cir. 2024).1  Thus, it \nwasn\u2019t unreasonable for the court to consider them here. \n \nViolation Grade.  A release violation is \u201cGrade A\u201d if it involves drug conduct punishable \nby more than a year in prison.  U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.1(a)(1).  Here, there was sufficient evidence of \nsuch conduct.  First, police witnessed Jaimez and his co-felons transport \u201cjust under a kilogram\u201d \nof marijuana in his car.  R. 381, Pg. ID 2169.  Second, Jaimez\u2019s car smelled like marijuana, \nsuggesting Jaimez\u2014a past drug user\u2014knew there were drugs in it.  Third, an Ohio court found \n \n1Judge Griffin adheres to his dissent from the denial of the petition to rehear Esteras en banc.  United \nStates v. Esteras, --- F.4th ----, 2024 WL 981140, at *1 (6th Cir. 2024) (Griffin, J., dissenting from denial of \nrehearing en banc). \nAppendix G\n55a\n\nNo. 23-3189 \nUnited States v. Jaimez \nPage 4 \n \n \nJaimez guilty of attempted marijuana trafficking, indicating he knew or had reason to know the \nmarijuana was intended for resale.  See Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7 2923.02(A) (noting that an \n\u201cattempt\u201d conviction means the defendant met any \u201cknowledge\u201d or \u201cpurpose\u201d elements of the \nunderlying crime); id. \u00a7 2925.03(A)(2) (defining mens rea for drug trafficking).  Based on this \nevidence, a court could conclude Jaimez knowingly transported just under a kilogram of \nmarijuana, aware it was intended for resale.  See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (setting a \npreponderance-of-the-evidence standard for revocation decisions).  And under Ohio law, that\u2019s \npunishable by over a year in prison.2  Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 2925.03(A)(2), (C)(3)(c), \n2929.14(A)(4).  Thus, the district court correctly graded Jaimez\u2019s violation. \nB. \n \nJaimez next alleges his sentence is substantively unreasonable.  In particular, he argues \nthe court (1) placed too much weight on the conduct underlying his release violation, (2) inflicted \n\u201cdouble punishment\u201d by considering conduct for which Ohio already punished him, and \n(3) imposed a sentence that was too long in light of mitigating evidence.  Again, Jaimez is wrong \non all three counts.  \n \nJaimez\u2019s Violative Conduct.  At sentencing, the district court \u201ckeyed in\u201d on the conduct \nunderlying Jaimez\u2019s release violation.  Appellant Suppl. Br. 2.  For good reason:  Jaimez was \noriginally convicted for conspiring to distribute drugs, and he had previously violated his \nsupervised release by using drugs.  Given this background, the conduct underlying his most \nrecent violation\u2014transporting drugs with the intent to resell them\u2014was particularly relevant.  \nWhen imposing revocation sentences, courts may consider the need to promote deterrence and \nrespect for the law.  18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2013(B), 3583(e); see Lewis, 498 F.3d at 399.  \nJaimez\u2019s most recent violation demonstrated a flagrant lack of both.  Thus, it was reasonable for \nthe court to give substantial weight to that violation at sentencing.  Cf. United States v. Zobel, \n696 F.3d 558, 571\u201372 (6th Cir. 2012).   \n \n2Ohio found Jaimez guilty of only a misdemeanor-level marijuana offense.  But when a federal court \ngrades a release violation, it considers the defendant\u2019s actual conduct, not just the record of conviction.  United \nStates v. Montgomery, 893 F.3d 935, 940 (6th Cir. 2018). \nAppendix G\n56a\n\nNo. 23-3189 \nUnited States v. Jaimez \nPage 5 \n \n \n \nDouble Punishment.  Jaimez next argues he received \u201cdouble punishment\u201d for his drug-\ntrafficking activity.  Appellant Suppl. Br. 3.  But this presents no error, either.  To be sure, Ohio \nalready punished Jaimez for the drug-related conduct that the district court considered at \nsentencing.  But that\u2019s the point:  the Sentencing Guidelines explicitly tell courts to consider the \ncriminal nature of a release violation.  See U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 7B1.1(a), .4(a).  And the Supreme Court \nhas long held that federal and state governments may separately punish an individual for the \nsame conduct.  See, e.g., Heath v. Alabama, 474 U.S. 82, 88 (1985); Fox v. Ohio, 46 U.S. (5 \nHow.) 410, 435 (1847).   \nJaimez\u2019s argument also fails for a simpler reason:  revocation sentences are never \n\u201cpunishment\u201d for a release violation.  Rather, these sentences are \u201cpart of the penalty for the \ninitial offense\u201d\u2014in this case, Jaimez\u2019s original narcotics-distribution conspiracy.  Johnson v. \nUnited States, 529 U.S. 694, 700\u201301 (2000).  Indeed, even when a court expressly considers the \nconduct underlying a release violation, we don\u2019t interpret the resulting sentence as \u201cpunishment\u201d \nfor that conduct.  See, e.g., United States v. Johnson, 640 F.3d 195, 203 (6th Cir. 2011) (holding \nthat a revocation sentence is a \u201csanction\u201d for a defendant\u2019s \u201cbreach of trust,\u201d not a \u201cpunishment \nfor [his] violation\u201d (citation omitted)); United States v. Jones, 81 F.4th 591, 602 n.7 (6th Cir. \n2023) (same); Esteras, 88 F.4th at 1170 (holding that a court\u2019s consideration of violative conduct \ndoesn\u2019t make a revocation sentence punitive, even when the court uses the word \u201cpunishment\u201d).  \nThus, the district court\u2019s sentence didn\u2019t \u201cdouble punish\u201d Jaimez for his violation. \n \nSentence Length.  At the outset, we presume Jaimez\u2019s within-Guidelines sentence is \nreasonable.  See Jones, 81 F.4th at 602.  Jaimez contends otherwise.  He argues the court \nshouldn\u2019t have applied the maximum sentence because his release violations could have been \nworse.  He also asserts that he\u2019s been trying to \u201crebuild[] his life.\u201d  Reply Br. 3.  And he \nemphasizes that he didn\u2019t contest his release violations or his Ohio drug charge.  This, he claims, \ndemonstrates his \u201cremorse.\u201d  Id.   \nBut Jaimez\u2019s arguments aren\u2019t enough to establish unreasonableness.  The fact Jaimez \ncould\u2019ve committed a worse offense doesn\u2019t render the statutory maximum unreasonable.  Every \ndrug trafficker could have shipped more drugs, just like every murderer could have killed an \nadditional person.  That doesn\u2019t mean courts should never apply a maximum sentence.   \nAppendix G\n57a\n\nNo. 23-3189 \nUnited States v. Jaimez \nPage 6 \n \n \nNor can Jaimez show unreasonableness by arguing he would have given more weight to \nmitigating evidence.  See United States v. Ely, 468 F.3d 399, 404 (6th Cir. 2006).  And even if he \ncould, his mitigating evidence is paper-thin.  While his words suggested remorse, his conduct did \nnot.  At Jaimez\u2019s last revocation hearing, the court warned him that he\u2019d receive a sixty-month \nsentence if he didn\u2019t straighten out his act.  That didn\u2019t stop Jaimez from continuing to flout the \nlaw.  And at some point, protecting the public must trump a defendant\u2019s desire to \u201crebuild his \nlife.\u201d  This is one such case. \n* \n* \n* \n \nWe affirm. \nAppendix G\n58a\n\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO \nWESTERN DIVISION \nUnited States of America, \nCase No. 3:10cr4-2 \nPlaintiff \nv. \nORDER \nTimothy M.

And, yes, it was put in The\nBlade, but it didn't hurt me at all, Your Honor, because I\nhave no connection to the streets anymore.  So, like I\nsaid, I put myself in a very bad situation time and time\nagain.  It's not your fault, it's not Ms. Dustin's fault,\nnobody's fault but my own.  I'm just sorry that I'm\ndragging down people that are close to me and people who I\ndo -- I do care about and love, that I affect their lives\nas well.  So as of -- since the beginning of all of this,\nI've taken my own -- when I'm in the wrong, I take\nresponsibility and I keep on moving.  And with that, I\nagree with whatever you give me, Your Honor.  Thank you.\nTHE COURT:  Mr. Schuman, anything further?\nMR. SCHUMAN:  No, thank you, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT:  Anything further from the government?\nMS. DUSTIN:  Nothing, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT:  Pursuant to the Sentencing Reform Act\nof 1984 and 18 U.S. Code Section 3553(a), judgment of this\nCourt that defendant be and hereby committed to the custody\nof the Bureau of Prisons to serve a term of 60 months.  \nUpon completion of that term, you should report\nwithin 72 hours U.S. Pretrial and Probation Office in this\ndistrict or U.S. Probation Office in whatever district you\nare released.\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\nAppendix I\n61a\n\n    63\nI will, likewise, strongly encourage the Bureau\nto let you serve your time in Milan.  I don't know if\nyou're a threat, or security issue, or anything else.  To\nthe extent that their mechanistic computation might put you\nat a higher security level, I would encourage them to look\npast that and enable both of you to remain in contact with\nyour people here in Toledo.  \nI'm going to place you, likewise, on a period of\nsix more years of supervised release.  I'll be very candid\nwith you, I'm going to be very candid with both of you, I\nwant this Court to have that string.  And if you can't\nabide by each term and condition of supervised release,\nyou'll be right back in front of me or another Judge.  And\nyou'll wind up, yet again -- but you've shown that\nbasically, now twice, the terms and conditions of\nsupervised release are optional.  And they are not\noptional.  And I want to make sure, in terms of your own\ninterest, and the interest of the community, and to protect\nthe community, and also anybody who knows what's happening\nhere today gets it that disregarding the terms and\nconditions of supervised release, particularly in the\nquantity -- if large quantity of Controlled Substance is\ninvolved, you're going to get punished.  You're going to\npay a severe consequence.  I hope you understand that,\nMr. Watters.  You've went through it, I remember it\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\nAppendix I\n62a\n\n    64\nvividly, I remember correctly Officer Robinson was just\ntrying to get some financial information, you were\nproviding her with statements about your employment and\noccupation and so forth.  She wanted to know.  And if I\nrecall correctly, she had to go knocking on doors of banks.\nIt was an exhaustive time consuming effort on her part that\nshould not -- she should not have had to take the time to\nget the information she did had you been honest with her.\nYou blew her off, you blew off the conditions of supervised\nrelease about responding to the request for financial\ninformation.  And at least that night when you're out there\nwith your brother and Mr. Carrizales and the garbage bag\nwith a lot of marijuana in it, upward of a kilo, once\nagain, you were paying no attention to the terms and\nconditions of supervised release.  And my lengthy term of\ncontinued supervised release is to try to see to it that,\nat long last, you get it, and also to serve -- not just try\nto see to it that you do, but that you learn to comply with\nwhat The Court and the law tells you you have to do.\nAlso to make clear to the public generally that\nsomeone like yourself doesn't get it, then they're going to\nget prison time, and a lot of it.  That's the purpose of my\nsentence.\nYou will report to the pretrial service and\nprobation office.  All of the previous terms and conditions\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\nAppendix I\n63a\n\n    65\nwill be reimposed.  \nAnd Officer Hagins, is there anything else at\nthis time?  There'll be the special condition about\nundertaking to obtain and maintain lawful gainful\nemployment, and to cooperate with the probation officer and\nyour officer's efforts in that regard.\nOnce again, you'll be required to provide,\npromptly and accurately, any requested financial\ninformation that the probation officer may ask you to\nprovide.\nOfficer Hagins, any further special conditions\nyou'd like me to impose or reimpose?\nPROBATION:  No, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT:  Okay.  I believe I expressed my --\nthe -- my reasons for imposition of this sentence.  They\nare to protect the public.  They are to encourage\nunderstanding of compliance of the terms and conditions,\nindividual deterrence, and public deterrence.  In this\nCourt there's no such thing as an optional condition of\nsupervision, just as there's no optional condition when\nyou're on pretrial release.  They're court orders, and this\nis a consequence of not obeying a court order.  I told you\nbefore, Mr. Watters, you're not in The State system\nanymore.  We care, we pay attention, and we respond.\nI have considered your background, history and\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\nAppendix I\n64a\n\n    66\ncharacteristics, your prior criminal record with which I'm\nobviously quite familiar.  And I do think that somebody\nlooking at this with the overall circumstances would find\nthat this is both a just and deserved sanction, and would\nhope that it would enhance respect for the law.\nMs. Dustin, anything further you want me to say\nabout the 3553(a) factors?\nMS. DUSTIN:  Perhaps just addressing the\ndeterrence factor.\nTHE COURT:  I can't quite hear you.\nMS. DUSTIN:  Perhaps address the deterrence\nfactor, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT:  I thought I had, both individual and\npublic deterrence.  I hope others hear about this.  When\nyou come to Federal Court, you're in the big leagues.  We\nplay hard ball.  There's no paddle ball here, okay, no\nshrug of the shoulders.  We give you a chance at a break,\nyou don't take that chance, we move things up a notch.  And\nyou're really Exhibit A in that regard, Mr. Watters.  I'm\nsorry that you are, but I think it's necessary that you be\nso that people understand they can't be out abroad in the\ncompany of people you shouldn't be with doing things that\nthe law prohibits and expect -- if you get caught, we'll\nsimply reinstate the terms and conditions of supervised\nrelease and tell you to behave, tell you to do that,\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\nAppendix I\n65a\n\n    67\nbecause that's the bottom line when we get right down to\nit.  \nI do believe that the sentence is sufficient but\nnot greater than necessary to get your attention, to see to\nit, I hope, that once you are out, you will, at long last,\nlearn that lesson.  You've got to do, no matter how much\nyou don't want to do it, you may desire to do something\nelse, as long as you're on supervised release for this\nCourt, you've got to do what this Court, myself, and the\nprobation officer says.  That's your only option.  Because\nif you don't and you come back, whoever sees you then,\nwhether it's I or somebody else, is going to look at this,\nand they're going to ask, just as I did, implicitly, how\nhigh is up, because going up as high as I can so that I\nbelieve it's necessary, particularly in your circumstance,\nto make clear that you've got to do what the law and The\nCourt requires.  If you don't, this is what's going to\nhappen to somebody else who hears about it.  They've got a\nsimilar situation, I hope they get the lesson that that's\nwhat's going to happen to them.  Ultimately I'm protecting\nthe community.\nAnything further you want me to say, Ms. Dustin,\nabout the 3553(a) factors?\nMS. DUSTIN:  No, Your Honor.  Thank you.\nTHE COURT:  You have a right, as I've indicated\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\nAppendix I\n66a\n\n    68\nto Mr. Carrizales, to appeal.  Talk to Mr. Schuman, your\nvery capable lawyer, as that Mr. Wagner is, and if grounds\nto appeal appear to exist, by all means within 14 days file\na notice of appeal.  If you decide to have him and he\ndesires to continue to represent you, he'll do so without\ncost to yourself.  The record will be prepared without cost\nto yourself.  And if either you or he wants you to have\nanother attorney, different attorney, we'll make that\nrequest known to either me or to the Court of Appeals.  Do\nyou understand all that?\nDEFENDANT WATTERS:  Yes, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT:  Within 14 days, 14 days.  It's a very\nshort timeframe.  After that, you will lose -- if you\nhaven't filed a notice of appeal, you will lose any and all\nright you might otherwise have to challenge what I've done\ntoday, either by way of direct appeal, post-conviction\nrelief, or habeas corpus.  Do you understand that?\nDEFENDANT WATTERS:  Yes, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT:  I want to repeat that to you too,\nMr. Carrizales; 14 days, otherwise you lose the opportunity\nto challenge whatever.\nDoes any party have any objection to any part of\nthese proceedings not previously made?\nMR. WAGNER:  No, Your Honor.\nMR. SCHUMAN:  Your Honor, few remarks if I may.\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\nAppendix I\n67a\n\n    69\nI have a few requests if I may.\nTHE COURT:  Sure.\nMR. SCHUMAN:  Thank you, Your Honor.\nMy client wishes to have the no contact order\nwith Mr. Carrizales removed; credit for 13 months in\ncustody on this violation, which I think is appropriate.\nHe requested 14-months credit for the time served on the\nearlier violation.  He notes he had three years of\nsupervised release previously.\nI object, for the record, to the sentence imposed\nfor purpose of appeal.\nMy client also notes that his proper last name\nnow is -- I hope I say it correctly, Jaimez J-A-I-M-E-Z.\nHis name was legally changed in State Court in Ohio some\nyears ago.\nTHE COURT:  I think -- you know, I think that had\noccurred before, but it wasn't brought to my attention.  I\nwill note that.  Let me only say I'm going to refrain from\nmaking any recommendation as to what the Bureau of Prisons\nshould do in terms of his computation for time served.\nThat's entirely within the province of the Bureau of\nPrisons.  \nCorrect, Ms. Sterling?\nMS. DUSTIN:  Your Honor, I believe he would not\nget credit because he was already serving time on The State\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\nAppendix I\n68a\n\n    70\noffense.  I think he was being held with -- he already got\ncredit for that time.  He did not have to serve the 180\ndays because they gave him credit for the 180 days.\nTHE COURT:  All I'm saying -- I don't know, it's\nreally out of my hands.  I can sit and try to do a\ncomputation.  I will simply say that I expect that, both\nMr. Carrizales and he, shall oversee what the Bureau of\nPrisons will be attentive and accurately calculate the time\nserved credit as to the sentence that I've imposed.  Beyond\nthat, I can't -- I have no authority to -- Ms. Sterling,\nyou and I have had a couple of occasions where it was made\nvery clear to me that that computation, whether a defendant\nbelieves it's correct or not, cannot come back to me to\nsecure any kind of -- is that right, Ms. Sterling?\nMS. STERLING:  That is correct, Your Honor.  I\nthink there's a distinction here, although it's one without\na difference, and that is this; if a defendant is being\nheld solely on this Court's violation order, then he would\nget credit.  However, at least six months for these\ngentlemen, because they received credit for six months on\nThe State case, they would not get credit for.  And the way\nThe Court is supposed to accomplish that is by imposing a\nhigher sentence than what you normally would have, but you\ncan't do that here because you sentenced them at the\nstatutory maximum.  So I think for the record that explains\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\nAppendix I\n69a\n\n    71\nthat.\nWith regard to the protection order issue that\nMr. Schuman raised between the two; again, that is a matter\nthat will be addressed by the BOP relative to their\nsecurity concerns.\nTHE COURT:  Right.  I do hope both of you\ngentlemen are up the road rather than some distant isolated\nfederal facility that, from a practical standpoint, will\nmake it difficult, if not impossible, to bring your family\nto have a face-to-face visitation or contact.  I think,\ncandidly, with just about everybody who comes before me,\nconfining them as close to home as possible is an important\ncomponent ultimately of reentry and rehabilitation.  Family\ncontact is and remains, in my view, important.  But, once\nagain, Mr. Schuman, that's all that I can do.  I'll take\nnote of that.  I'll certainly expect the Bureau of Prisons\nto accurately and attentively calculate the proper credit\nfor time served.\nMR. SCHUMAN:  I understand, Your Honor.\nMy only last comment is my client indicates that\nThe Court previously directed the Marshals to correct his\nlast name to Jaimez.  Apparently it didn't happen.  I'll\nleave it at that.\nTHE COURT:  I will so instruct the Marshals.  May\nI suggest that you go on upstairs and get in touch with\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\nAppendix I\n70a\n\n    72\nAlex and both, formally and informally, make that request.\nI also suggest that you send a copy of that -- CC that\nrequest to Pete Elliot, who's the U.S. Marshal.  And I also\nsuggest, follow up on it.\nMR. SCHUMAN:  Thank you, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT:  In that respect, a phone call from me\nto anybody needing my help, I'm glad to do that.  I really\nam.  I now remember I think that had occurred before the\nlast -- the last supervised release proceedings.\nMR. SCHUMAN:  I think so, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT:  And I apologize, I had forgotten\nthat.  Mr. Watters is still -- Mr. Jaimez.\nMR. SCHUMAN:  Jaimez.\nTHE COURT:  -- is still being considered to be\nMr. Timothy Watters.  So that's why --\nMR. SCHUMAN:  Thank you, Your Honor.\nMS. DUSTIN:  Your Honor, I think we were having a\ndiscussion, and I don't think Mr. Schuman answered the\nBostic question.\nTHE COURT:  I'm sorry, I can't hear you.\nMS. DUSTIN:  I don't think Mr. Schuman answered\nthe Bostic question.\nTHE COURT:  Okay.  Any other objections not\npreviously made, Mr. Schuman?\nMR. SCHUMAN:  No, Your Honor.\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\nAppendix I\n71a\n\n    73\nMS. STERLING:  Mr. Wagner, once again?\nMR. WAGNER:  No, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT:  Okay.  That will conclude this\nproceeding.\nCOURTROOM DEPUTY:  Your Honor, there's a pending\nmotion to be addressed on the record about Mr. Watters.\nTHE COURT:  You have some motions, Mr. Schuman,\npreviously made that are going to be withdrawn; is that\ncorrect?\nMR.

Am I correct?  \nPROBATION OFFICER:  That is correct, \nYour Honor. \nTHE COURT:  All right.  It is generally my \npractice not to consider new law violations that have not \nbeen resolved, so I am not going to consider alleged \nViolation Number 2.  \nNumber 3, failure to report. \nMr. Leaks failed to report on May 18th, May 31st, and \nJune 8th of 2022. \nThe fourth is failure to attend mental health \ntreatment. \nHe failed to attend group session on May 13th, \nMay 24th, and June 1st of 2022. \nFifth, failure to work towards GED. \nAppendix L\n80a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n5\nHe failed to work toward getting the GED -- GED since \ncommencing supervision. \nAnd finally, a new law violation.  \nOn May 11th, 2023, Mr. Leaks pled guilty to having a \nweapon while under disability with a 3-year sentence to run \nconcurrent with the new law violation that I've already \ndiscussed, Violation Number 1. \nMr. Roberts, on behalf of your client, do you wish for \nthis Court to hear testimony regarding these alleged \nviolations, or do you waive the taking of testimony and \nadmit?  \nMR. ROBERTS:  Your Honor, in light of the fact \nthat the Court is not considering Violation Number 2 at this \ntime, we waive the testimony and do admit to the other \nviolations. \nTHE COURT:  Sir, do you understand what your \nattorney just said to me?  \nTHE DEFENDANT:  Yes, ma'am. \nTHE COURT:  And do you, in fact, admit to \nViolations 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6?  \nTHE DEFENDANT:  Yes, ma'am. \nTHE COURT:  Sir, based upon your admission, I \ndo in fact find you to be in violation of supervised \nrelease. \nI find that the most serious is a Grade B violation, \nAppendix L\n81a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n6\nand with a Criminal History Category of III you are looking \nat an advisory sentencing guideline range of 8 to 14 months. \nOn the issue of sentencing, Mr. Roberts, should I turn \nto you first or your client?  \nMR. ROBERTS:  Your Honor, just briefly, we \nunderstand because of the nature of the violation that the \nCourt is required by statute to impose a term of \nimprisonment.  We would ask the Court to run any term of \nimprisonment concurrent to the now 4 to 6 years that \nMr. Leaks received.  He obviously accepted responsibility \nfor that case and, actually, when you look at the purposes \nof sentencing, at least on a supervised release violation, \nTitle 18 United States Code \u00a7 3583(a) specifically omits the \nCourt's consideration of Title 18 United States Code \n3553(a)(2) which otherwise would be present in a regular \nsentencing, that being the seriousness of the offense, \nrespect for law and punishment.  All of those are omitted \nfrom a supervised release sentencing and have been addressed \nwith the 4 to 6-year sentence that he received for the \nconduct in the new law violation. \nWe would ask the Court to consider that he's going to \nbe on 18 months' mandatory post-release control also on that \ncase and will continue to be supervised by court officials \nas he seeks to re-enter the community and rehabilitate \nhimself. \nAppendix L\n82a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n7\nThank you, Your Honor. \nTHE COURT:  Mr. Leaks, do you have anything to \nsay, sir?  \nTHE DEFENDANT:  Um. . . I just would like to \nsay that I learned my lesson and I want to make sure that I \ninfluence my younger family members that look up to me and \nthink, what are we doing or whatever I was contributing to \nwas cool, that this ain't the way to go. \nTHE COURT:  Mr. Zarzycki. \nMR. ZARZYCKI:  Thank you, Your Honor.  \nIt's the government's position that a consecutive \nguideline sentence is appropriate for Mr. Leaks, under \n7B1.3(f), that it was to be served consecutively to a \nsentence of imprisonment. \nYour Honor, this involved a -- as the Court's aware \nfrom having his original case, involved the Possession of a \nMachine Gun and next to this machine gun -- which \nwas functional -- there were three magazines, 15 rounds, \n20 rounds and 30 rounds.  So his violations -- like, he was \nsentenced to 4 years for the criminal offenses that he \ncommitted.  I ask the Court to impose a consecutive sentence \nbecause of the violations of this Court's supervision, and \nthat supervision was based on the prior offense of -- or his \nconviction of having this dangerous machine gun. \nNow, one of his offenses to which he's been convicted \nAppendix L\n83a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n8\nin state court involves another firearm as recently as \nFebruary of this year. \nAnother offense is a robbery that is an offense of \nviolence as well as his failure to adhere to any of the -- \nor many of the requirements of his supervision. \nI believe that a consecutive sentence would be \nappropriate for those violations. \nTHE COURT:  Mr. Capuano. \nPROBATION OFFICER:  Hello, Your Honor. \nYour Honor, U.S. Probation Office would just like to \nadd that, unfortunately, this is a very unfortunate \ncircumstance for Mr. Leaks.  Mr. Leaks is a very young man.  \nHe has a lot of future ahead of him and these are some very \nserious charges that he has in front of him violations-wise. \nIn regard to recommendations, Your Honor, we would \nalso recommend that a term of imprisonment is imposed and \nthat it be served consecutive to his state sentence as well. \nOriginally we were recommending a term of supervised \nrelease to follow as well.  However, based upon his state \nsentences, he does have mandatory post-release control with \nthe State of Ohio with the Adult Parole Authority and we \nwould not be opposed to -- if he does not have supervised \nrelease through us, Your Honor, following the sentence. \nThank you. \nTHE COURT:  Mr. Roberts, anything else?  \nAppendix L\n84a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n9\nMR. ROBERTS:  No, Your Honor, other than to -- \njust to reiterate, I know there's been reference to the \nseriousness of the offenses, both the original offense and \nthe new offense, and I would just reiterate that he's been \nsentenced and is serving his time for those. \nThank you, Your Honor. \nTHE COURT:  And yet I agree with all of the \nstatements made by Mr. Zarzycki.  To be on supervision and \nhave five violations, two of which are new law violations, \nboth involving firearms, and the original offense here \ninvolved a machine gun.  Concurrent time does not punish \nMr. Leaks for violating supervision and -- and. . . that is \nnot justice. \nTherefore, it is the judgment of this Court that you \nbe committed to the custody of the Bureau of Prisons to be \nimprisoned for a term of 12 months consecutive to the time \nbeing served in the two state cases. \nThere will be no further supervision. \nMr. Leaks, I wish you the best, and I certainly hope \nyou turn your life around because you are a very young man, \nas Mr. Capuano pointed out.  \nBoy, this is not the road to go down.  You're going to \nbe in and out of prisons the rest of your life.  I see it.  \nI see it with one defendant after another. \nI don't want that for you.  I hope this is your \nAppendix L\n85a\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n10\nwake-up call.  \nGood luck. \nTHE DEFENDANT:  Yes, ma'am. \nMR. ROBERTS:  Your Honor, just on Mr. Leaks' \nbehalf, if -- \nTHE COURT:  One moment, sir. \nMR. ROBERTS:  We would just object to the \nconsideration of punishment as it relates to the sentence.  \nI understand all of the other factors the Court may have \nconsidered, but as it relates to considering punishment from \nthe new offense, we would object in case he wants to perfect \nany kind of appeal on that issue. \nThank you. \nTHE COURT:  All righty.  \nSir, you certainly have the right to appeal, if you so \nchoose. \nTHE DEFENDANT:  Okay.  \nMR. ZARZYCKI:  Are we adjourned, Your Honor?  \nTHE COURT:  Oh, we're adjourned.  I'm sorry.\n    (Proceedings adjourned at 11:19 a.m.)\n \nC E R T I F I C A T E\nI certify that the foregoing is a correct transcript \nof the record of proceedings in the above-entitled matter \nprepared from my stenotype notes.\n/s/ Heather K.

This \nCourt\u2019s jurisdiction rests on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01254(1).\nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED\nSection 3583(e) of Title 18, United States Code, \nprovides:\nModification of Conditions or Revocation.\u2014\nThe court may, after considering the factors set \nforth in section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)\n(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7)\u2014\n(1)\u2003 terminate a term of supervised release \nand discharge the defendant released at \nany time after the expiration of one year of \nsupervised release, pursuant to the provisions \nof the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure \nrelating to the modification of probation, if it \nis satisfied that such action is warranted by \nthe conduct of the defendant released and the \ninterest of justice;\n(2)\u2003 extend a term of supervised release if \nless than the maximum authorized term was \npreviously imposed, and may modify, reduce, \nor enlarge the conditions of supervised \nrelease, at any time prior to the expiration or \ntermination of the term of supervised release, \npursuant to the provisions of the Federal \n\n3\nRules of Criminal Procedure relating to the \nmodification of probation and the provisions \napplicable to the initial setting of the terms \nand conditions of post-release supervision;\n(3)\u2003 revoke a term of supervised release, \nand require the defendant to serve in prison \nall or part of the term of supervised release \nauthorized by statute for the offense that \nresulted in such term of supervised release \nwithout credit for time previously served on \npost\u00adrelease supervision, if the court, pursuant \nto the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure \napplicable to revocation of probation or \nsupervised release, finds by a preponderance \nof the evidence that the defendant violated a \ncondition of supervised release, except that \na defendant whose term is revoked under \nthis paragraph may not be required to serve \non any such revocation more than 5 years in \nprison if the offense that resulted in the term \nof supervised release is a class A felony, more \nthan 3 years in prison if such offense is a class \nB felony, more than 2 years in prison if such \noffense is a class C or D felony, or more than \none year in any other case; or\n(4)\u2003\norder the defendant to remain at \nhis place of residence during nonworking \nhours and, if the court so directs, to have \ncompliance monitored by telephone or \nelectronic signaling devices, except that an \norder under this paragraph may be imposed \nonly as an alternative to incarceration.\n\n4\nSection 3553(a) of Title 18, U.S. Code, provides:\nFactors To Be Considered in Imposing a \nSentence.\u2014The court shall impose a sentence \nsufficient, but not greater than necessary, \nto comply with the purposes set forth in \nparagraph (2) of this subsection. The court, \nin determining the particular sentence to be \nimposed, shall consider\u2014\n(1)\u2003 the nature and circumstances of the \noffense and the history and characteristics \nof the defendant;\n(2)\u2003 the need for the sentence imposed\u2014\n(A)\u2003\nto reflect the seriousness of the \noffense, to promote respect for the law, and \nto provide just punishment for the offense;\n(B)\u2003\nto afford adequate deterrence to \ncriminal conduct;\n(C)\u2003 to protect the public from further \ncrimes of the defendant; and\n(D)\u2003 to provide the defendant with needed \neducational or vocational training, medical \ncare, or other correctional treatment in the \nmost effective manner;\n(3)\u2003 the kinds of sentences available;\n(4)\u2003 the kinds of sentence and the sentencing \nrange established for\u2014\n\n5\n(A)\u2003 the applicable category of offense \ncommitted by the applicable category of \ndefendant as set forth in the guidelines\u2014\n(i)\u2003 issued by the Sentencing Commission \npursuant to section 994(a)(1) of title \n28, United States Code, subject to any \namendments made to such guidelines by \nact of Congress (regardless of whether such \namendments have yet to be incorporated \nby the Sentencing Commission into \namendments issued under section 994(p) \nof title 28); and\n(ii)\u2003 that, except as provided in section \n3742(g), are in effect on the date the \ndefendant is sentenced; or\n(B)\u2003 in the case of a violation of probation \nor supervised release, the applicable \nguidelines or policy statements issued by the \nSentencing Commission pursuant to section \n994(a)(3) of title 28, United States Code, \ntaking into account any amendments made \nto such guidelines or policy statements by \nact of Congress (regardless of whether such \namendments have yet to be incorporated \nby the Sentencing Commission into \namendments issued under section 994(p) \nof title 28);\n(5)\u2003 any pertinent policy statement\u2014\n(A)\u2003 issued by the Sentencing Commission \npursuant to section 994(a)(2) of title \n\n6\n28, United States Code, subject to \nany amendments made to such policy \nstatement by act of Congress (regardless \nof whether such amendments have yet to be \nincorporated by the Sentencing Commission \ninto amendments issued under section \n994(p) of title 28); and\n(B)\u2003 that, except as provided in section \n3742(g), is in effect on the date the defendant \nis sentenced.\n(6)\u2003 the need to avoid unwarranted sentence \ndisparities among defendants with similar \nrecords who have been found guilty of similar \nconduct; and\n(7)\u2003 the need to provide restitution to any \nvictims of the offense.\nSTATEMENT\nUnlike every other sentencing option, Congress \nintended supervised release to fulfill only nonretributive \ngoals. Congress thus omitted 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s \nretribution factors from the list for courts to consider \nwhen imposing, terminating, modifying, or revoking \nsupervised release, thereby precluding courts from \nconsidering those factors.\nThe Sentencing Reform Act (\u201cSRA\u201d) lists sentencing \nfactors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03553(a), and other provisions instruct \ncourts what to do with those factors when considering \nthe four sentencing options\u2014probation, fine, prison, and \n\n7\nsupervised release. Supervised release is different from \nthe others. For the first three options, the applicable \nstatutes include Section 3553(a)(2)(A) among the list \nof factors for courts to consider when imposing the \nsentence. For supervised release, the statute omits \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A). See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(c). Similarly, \nwhen modifying or revoking probation, the applicable \nstatute includes Section 3553(a)(2)(A) among the list \nof factors for courts to consider. When modifying or \nrevoking supervised release, the statute omits Section \n3553(a)(2)(A). See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(e). That difference in \nlanguage indicates a difference in meaning: courts may not \nconsider the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors when imposing \nsupervised release (as both this Court and the Government \nsaid in Tapia v. United States) and may not consider them \nwhen modifying or revoking supervised release.\nThat difference in language is also no accident. Unlike \nthe other three sentencing options, supervised release \ndoes not stand alone. It is a discretionary supplement \nthat follows a prison term. A prison term itself fulfills all \nthe sentencing factors, including the need for retributive \npunishment under Section 3553(a)(2)(A). The purpose of \nsupervised release, as expressed through the statute\u2019s \ntext, is to protect the public while providing rehabilitative \nsupport as a defendant transitions out of prison and back \ninto society. The sentencing court imposes conditions \nto further those forward-looking goals. When a person \nviolates the supervised-release conditions, a court may \nfurther those goals by, for example, incarcerating the \ndefendant to protect the public or to compel compliance \nwith the conditions imposed. Backward-looking retributive \npunishment is a matter for a separate prosecution, if \nappropriate, and not for a revocation proceeding.\n\n8\nIn the decisions below, the court of appeals nevertheless \nheld that Section 3583(e) allows courts to consider \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution factors when revoking \nsupervised release. That conclusion nullifies the textual \ndifferences between Section 3583(e) and its neighboring \nstatutes, and it ignores Congress\u2019s distinct purposes \nfor supervised release. To give effect to the text and \nto reflect Congress\u2019s intent as expressed in the SRA, \nthis Court should reverse the judgment of the court of \nappeals and hold that Section 3583(e) precludes courts \nfrom considering the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors when \nmodifying or revoking supervised release.\nI.\t Legal Background\nThrough the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, Pub. \nL. No. 98-473, 98 Stat. 1987, Congress eliminated \nindeterminate sentencing and parole, replacing that \nsystem with determinate sentences (subject to limited \nexceptions). Recognizing that some offenders would need \nrehabilitation or other assistance transitioning back into \nsociety, Congress created supervised release, a new \ndiscretionary supplement to follow a prison sentence. See \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583. Unlike parole, supervised release does \nnot replace a portion of the defendant\u2019s prison sentence, \nbut rather supports rehabilitation after a prison sentence \nis complete. Id.; United States v. Johnson, 529 U.S. 53, \n59 (2000).\nIn the SRA and subsequent amendments, Congress \nadopted sentencing factors for courts to consider and \nspecified how those factors apply differently to different \nsentencing options. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03553(a) (factors); \n3562(a) (probation); 3572(a) (fines); 3582(a) (prison); \n\n9\n3583(c) (supervised release). Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2014the \nneed for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the \noffense, promote respect for the law, and provide just \npunishment\u2014is included in the list of factors for courts \nto consider when imposing probation, a fine, or prison. \nSee 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03562(a) (probation); 3572(a) (fine); 3582(a) \n(prison). It is omitted from the list of factors to consider \nwhen imposing supervised release. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(c). \nLikewise, Section 3553(a)(2)(A) is included in the list of \nfactors for courts to consider when modifying or revoking \nprobation. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03565(a). It is omitted from the \nlist of factors to consider when modifying or revoking \nsupervised release. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(e).\nII.\t Proceedings Below\nEdgardo Esteras, Timothy Jaimez (fka Timothy \nWatters), and Toriano Leaks, Jr., each were charged \nwith and convicted of a federal crime. After completing \na custodial sentence, each began serving a term of \nsupervised release. The district courts later found that \neach of them violated conditions of supervised release, \nand the courts revoked supervised release and imposed \nnew terms of incarceration. During their revocation \nproceedings, the courts expressly relied on one or more \nof the factors set forth in Section 3553(a)(2)(A). The court \nof appeals affirmed their sentences.\na.\u2003 Edgardo Esteras\u2019s Revocation Proceedings. After \na contested hearing, the district court found that Esteras \nviolated his supervised-release conditions by possessing \na firearm. When making its factual findings, the court \nreferred to \u201cthe punishment I will issue today.\u201d JA 94a. \nThe court revoked Esteras\u2019s supervised release and varied \n\n10\nupward from the 6-to-12-month advisory guidelines range, \nsentencing him to 24 months in prison and three years of \nsupervised release. JA 98a, 116a.\nEsteras objected that \u201cthe Court indicated that it \nconsidered factors\u2014the factor in Section 3553(a)(2)(A) as \npart of its sentence.\u201d JA 105a. The district court confirmed \nthat \u201cpart of my contemplation certainly is the need for the \nsentence imposed, to promote respect for the law\u201d\u2014one \nof the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors. Id. In a later written \norder, the court stated that it \u201cconsidered the factors and \nconditions for sentencing listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03553(a) and \n3583(d), respectively.\u201d JA 115a.

JA 251a.\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\nBy omitting Section 3553(a)(2)(A) from the list of \nfactors to consider when modifying or revoking supervised \nrelease, Congress instructed courts not to consider \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution factors. That is the \nonly conclusion that gives effect to the statutory text, \nincluding the text in neighboring statutes that do not omit \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A). And it reflects Congress\u2019s goals in \ncreating supervised release, as reflected in the text, the \nhistory of the Sentencing Reform Act, and subsequent \namendments: creating a forward-looking framework for \ncourts to protect the public while assisting offenders as \nthey transition back into society.\na.\u2003 The analysis can begin and end with the text. \nCongress omitted Section 3553(a)(2)(A) from the list of \nfactors for courts to consider when imposing supervised \nrelease and when modifying or revoking supervised \nrelease. That omission was intentional, and courts may \nnot add omitted text to a statute. Additionally, at the \nsame time Congress omitted Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s \nretribution factors from the supervised-release statute, \nit included those factors in the lists for courts to consider \nwhen imposing prison, probation, or a fine, and it included \n\n13\nthem in the list for courts to consider when modifying \nor revoking probation. Under the negative-implication \ncanon (expressio unius est exclusio alterius), Congress \nthus further instructed courts not to consider the Section \n3553(a)(2)(A) factors when imposing, modifying, or \nrevoking supervised release.\nCompare the statutes governing probation revocation \nand supervised-release revocation. Under the former, \ncourts are to consider \u201cthe factors set forth in section \n3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a03565(a). Under the latter, courts are to consider \u201cthe \nfactors set forth in section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), \n(a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7),\u201d omitting Section \n3553(a)(2)(A). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(e). Under the interpretation \nadopted by the court of appeals, that omission makes no \ndifference, and courts can consider any Section 3553(a) \nfactors in either context. But giving effect to the different \nlanguage in the two provisions, the text establishes that \ncourts may not consider Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution \nfactors when modifying or revoking supervised release.\nb.\u2003 That conclusion also reflects the history of the \nSRA and subsequent amendments. Through the SRA, \nCongress abolished indeterminant sentencing and \nthe practice of using prison to attempt to rehabilitate \noffenders before releasing them on parole. It created \nsupervised release as a new discretionary supplement \nto a fixed prison term, used to encourage rehabilitation \nand assist newly released inmates as they transition back \ninto society. Reflecting Congress\u2019s rehabilitative goals, \nthe original statute did not even provide a mechanism for \nrevoking supervised release aside from a new prosecution \nfor criminal contempt or a separate offense. And, as \n\n14\nit does to this day, the statute instructed courts not to \nconsider retribution when modifying supervised release \nby omitting Section 3553(a)(2)(A) from the list of factors \nfor courts to consider.\nSubsequent amendments have reaffirmed Congress\u2019s \nnonretributive goals for supervised release. When \nCongress amended the supervised-release statute to \nadd a revocation mechanism, it maintained the list that \nexcluded Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution factors. And \nCongress has three times amended the statute since then \nto add other forward-looking factors for courts to consider \nwhen imposing, terminating, modifying, or revoking \nsupervised release. It has added Section 3553(a)(2)(C) (the \nneed to protect the public) and (a)(7) (the need to provide \nrestitution), but not Section 3553(a)(2)(A).\nc.\u2003 The interpretation adopted by the court of appeals \nposes constitutional problems. As this Court has said, \nconstruing revocation and subsequent imprisonment as \npunishment for violating supervised-release conditions \nwould raise serious constitutional questions regarding, \nfor example, the jury-trial right and double-jeopardy \nprotection. But the decisions below allow courts to do \nexactly that.\nd.\u2003 Applying the text as written is not \u201cunworkable,\u201d \nas the court of appeals said. Excluding the Section 3553(a)\n(2)(A) factors allows courts to consider all relevant \ninformation when modifying or revoking supervised \nrelease, filtered through only the purposes of sentencing \nthat Congress has determined apply in that context: \ndeterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation, but not \nretribution. Courts must consider only those purposes \n\n15\nwhen imposing supervised release, adopting conditions \nthat it deems appropriate for protecting the public while \nassisting the defendant as he or she transitions back into \nsociety. And courts must consider only those purposes \nwhen modifying or revoking supervising release, using \nadditional time in custody, if necessary, as a tool to protect \nthe public or compel the defendant into complying with the \nconditions imposed. If the defendant\u2019s conduct is criminal \nand warrants retributive punishment, a new prosecution is \nthe mechanism, not a revocation sentence. Nothing about \nthis framework is unworkable.\nARGUMENT\nI.\t The plain text of Section 3583 and neighboring \nstatutes dictates that Congress precluded courts \nfrom considering Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution \nfactors when imposing, modifying, or revoking \nsupervised release.\nThe statutory text alone resolves the question \npresented. Congress omitted Section 3553(a)(2)(A) from \nSection 3583\u2019s lists of factors for courts to consider when \nimposing, terminating, modifying, or revoking supervised \nrelease. Because courts may not add omitted text to a \nstatute, that omission precludes courts from considering \nthe Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors. Moreover, while omitting \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A) from the supervised-release statute, \nCongress included Section 3553(a)(2)(A) when listing \nfactors for courts to consider in other contexts. Applying \nthe negative-implication canon, and giving effect to the \ndifferent text in different provisions of the SRA, the \nomission in Section 3583(e) thus bars consideration of \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution factors.\n\n16\na.\u2003 Congress omitted Section 3553(a)(2)(A) from \nthe list of factors for courts to consider when imposing \nsupervised release and when terminating, modifying, \nor revoking supervised release. That omission was \nintentional, and courts may not add omitted text to the \nstatute. The plain text of Section 3583 thus precludes \ncourts from considering Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution \nfactors.\n\u201cIt is a fundamental principle of statutory \ninterpretation that \u2018absent provision[s] cannot be supplied \nby the courts.\u2019\u201d Rotkiske v. Klemm, 589 U.S. 8, 14 (2019) \n(quoting Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading \nLaw: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 94 (2012)). \nAdding omitted provisions \u201c\u2018is not a construction of the \nstatute, but, in effect, an enlargement of it by the court.\u2019\u201d \nNichols v. United States, 578 U.S. 104, 110 (2016) (quoting \nIselin v. United States, 270 U.S. 245, 251 (1926)). \u201c\u2018To \nsupply omissions transcends the judicial function.\u2019\u201d Id. \n(quoting Iselin, 270 U.S. at 251).\nIn 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03553(a), Congress set forth factors for \ncourts to consider when deciding what sentence to impose. \nSee 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03553(a). Subsection (a)(2) requires courts \nto consider:\n(2)\u2003 the need for the sentence imposed\u2014\n(A)\u2003 to reflect the seriousness of the offense, \nto promote respect for the law, and to provide \njust punishment for the offense;\n(B)\u2003\nto afford adequate deterrence to \ncriminal conduct;\n\n17\n(C)\u2003 to protect the public from further crimes \nof the defendant; and\n(D)\u2003 to provide the defendant with needed \neducational or vocational training, medical \ncare, or other correctional treatment in the \nmost effective manner[.]\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0 3553(a)(2). The subsection (a)(2) factors \ncorrespond to \u201cretribution, deterrence, incapacitation, and \nrehabilitation,\u201d which are \u201cthe four purposes of sentencing \ngenerally.\u201d Tapia v. United States, 564 U.S. 319, 325 (2011).\nSection 3583(c) lists factors from Section 3553(a) for \ncourts to consider when imposing supervised release: \u201cthe \nfactors set forth in section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), \n(a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(c). \nCongress omitted Section 3553(a)(2)(A) from the list.1\nThrough that omission, Congress instructed courts to \nconsider the listed factors, and not Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s \nretribution factors, when imposing supervised release. \nThis Court has said as much. See Tapia, 564 U.S. at 326 \n(\u201cThese provisions make clear that a particular purpose \nmay apply differently, or not at all, depending on the kind \nof sentence under consideration. For example, a court may \nnot take account of retribution (the first purpose listed in \n\u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)) when imposing a term of supervised release. \n1.\u2002 Congress also omitted Section 3553(a)(3), \u201cthe kinds of \nsentences available,\u201d from the list of factors in Section 3583(c). \nWhen a court is considering whether to impose supervised release \nfollowing a prison term, supervised release is the only sentence \navailable. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(a).\n\n18\nSee \u00a7\u00a03583(c).\u201d (emphasis in original)); see also Concepcion \nv. United States, 597 U.S. 481, 495 (2022) (same). So has \nthe Government. See Reply Brief for the United States, \nTapia v. United States, 564 U.S. 319 (2011) (No. 10-5400), \n2011 U.S. S.\u00a0Ct. Briefs LEXIS 451, *20 (\u201cSection 3583(c) \nexplicitly lists each Section 3553(a) factor that courts \nmust consider and omits the factors whose consideration \nCongress intended to preclude. See 18 U.S.C. 3583(c).\u201d).\nSimilarly, Section 3583(e) lists factors from Section \n3553(a) for courts to consider when terminating, \nmodifying, or revoking supervised release. The list is the \nsame as Section 3583(c): \u201cthe factors set forth in section \n3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), \nand (a)(7).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(e). Congress omitted Section \n3553(a)(2)(A) from that list as well.2\nJust as omitting Section 3553(a)(2)(A) from the list \nof factors in Section 3583(c) means that courts may not \nconsider those factors when imposing supervised release, \nTapia, 564 U.S. at 326, so does the same omission in \nSection 3583(e) mean that courts may not consider \nthose factors when terminating, modifying, or revoking \nsupervised release. \u201cThe statute says what it says\u2014or \nperhaps better put here, does not say what it does not \nsay.\u201d Cyan, Inc. v. Beaver County Employees Ret. Fund, \n583 U.S. 416, 426 (2018). \u201cWhen sentencing a defendant under \n\u00a7\u00a03583(e), a district court may not consider \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A) \nbecause Congress deliberately omitted that factor from \n2.\u2002 Congress again omitted Section 3553(a)(3), \u201cthe kinds of \nsentences available,\u201d from the list of factors in Section 3583(e). \nSection 3583(e) itself sets forth the options available to the court. \nSee 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(e).\n\n19\nthe permissible factors enumerated in the statute.\u201d United \nStates v. Miller, 634 F.3d 841, 844 (5th Cir. 2011); see also \nUnited States v. Booker, 63 F.4th 1254, 1261 (10th Cir. \n2023) (same); United States v.

Miqbel, 444 F.3d \n1173, 1182 (9th Cir. 2006) (same).\nb.\u2003\nThe differences between Section 3583 and \nneighboring provisions confirm this conclusion. When \nCongress listed factors for courts to consider when \nsentencing a defendant, it included Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s \nretribution factors when imposing prison, probation, or a \nfine, but not when imposing supervised release. Likewise, \nCongress included Section 3553(a)(2)(A) in the list of \nfactors to consider when modifying or revoking probation, \nbut not when modifying or revoking supervised release. \nUnder the principle of expressio unius est exclusio \nalterius, the negative-implication canon, Congress thus \ninstructed courts not to consider the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) \nfactors when imposing supervised release under Section \n3583(c) or when modifying or revoking supervised release \nunder Section 3583(e). Applying this principle is the only \nway to give effect to the different language Congress used \nin the different sections of the SRA.\n\u201cWhen Congress includes particular language in \none section of a statute but omits it from a neighbor, [this \nCourt] normally understand[s] that difference in language \nto convey a difference in meaning (expressio unius est \nexclusio alterius).\u201d Bittner v. United States, 598 U.S. \n85, 94 (2023). The Court has referred to this principle as \n\u201can ancient maxim,\u201d Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Nat\u2019l \nAss\u2019n of R.R. Passengers, 414 U.S. 453, 458 (1974), and a \n\u201ctraditional rule of statutory construction,\u201d Bittner, 598 \n\n20\nU.S. at 94. It has special force where, as here, \u201cCongress \nincludes particular language in one section of a statute \nbut omits it in another section of the same Act.\u201d Russello \nv. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted); see also Gozlon-Peretz v. United States, \n498 U.S. 395, 404-05 (1991) (same).\nCongress drafted and enacted the Sentencing \nReform Act of 1984, and has amended it since, against \nthis background. The SRA directs judges to sentence \nall defendants to prison, probation, or a fine, and allows \njudges to impose a fine in addition to prison or probation. \nSee 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03551(b) & (c). The Act permits judges to \nimpose supervised release to follow a prison sentence. See \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(a). And it specifies which factors apply \nto the different sentencing options, instructing courts to \nconsider:\n\u2022\t for prison, \u201cthe factors set forth in section \n3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, \nrecognizing that imprisonment is not an \nappropriate means of promoting correction \nand rehabilitation,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03582(a);\n\u2022\t for fines, eight listed factors \u201cin addition to \nthe factors set forth in section 3553(a),\u201d 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03572(a);\n\u2022\t for probation, \u201cthe factors set forth in \nsection 3553(a) to the extent that they are \napplicable,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03562(a); and\n\u2022\t for supervised release, \u201cthe factors set forth \nin section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), \n\n21\n(a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7),\u201d 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(c).\nCongress omitted Section 3553(a)(2)(A) from the list of \nfactors only in Section 3583(c).\nBy including Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution factors \nin neighboring statutes but not in Section 3583(c), Congress \ninstructed courts not to consider those factors when \nimposing supervised release. That conclusion flows from \na straightforward application of the negative-implication \ncanon. Congress included \u201cparticular language\u201d\u2014Section \n3553(a)(2)(A)\u2014in not just \u201cone section of a statute\u201d but \nseveral sections of the SRA, while \u201comit[ting] it from \na neighbor\u201d\u2014Section 3583(c).

Concepcion, 597 U.S. at 495 (noting that, in Section \n3583(c), Congress \u201cexpressly precluded\u201d district courts \nfrom considering the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors).\nThe SRA also specifies which factors apply when \ncourts consider whether to modify or revoke probation \nor supervised release:\n\u2022\t for probation, \u201cafter considering the factors \nset forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that \nthey are applicable,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03565(a); and\n\u2022\t for supervised release, \u201cafter considering \nthe factors set forth in section 3553(a)(1), \n(a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), \n(a)(6), and (a)(7),\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(e).\n\n22\nCongress omitted Section 3553(a)(2)(A) from the list of \nfactors only in Section 3583(e).\nBy including Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution \nfactors in a neighboring statute but not in Section 3583(e), \nCongress instructed courts not to consider those factors \nwhen modifying or revoking supervised release. That \nconclusion again flows from a straightforward application \nof the negative-implication canon.\nThat is the only interpretation that gives effect to \nthe textual differences between the statutes governing \nprobation and governing supervised release. When \nimposing and when modifying or revoking probation, the \napplicable statute instructs courts to consider \u201cthe factors \nset forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are \napplicable.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03562(a), 3565(a). When imposing \nand when modifying or revoking supervised release, \nthough, the statute instructs courts to consider \u201cthe \nfactors set forth in section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), \n(a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7),\u201d omitting Section \n3553(a)(2)(A). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a03583(c), (e). If courts could \nnevertheless consider the (a)(2)(A) factors in supervised-\nrelease-revocation proceedings, as the court of appeals \nconcluded, the probation and supervised-release statutes \nwould mean the same thing: consider any Section 3553(a) \nfactors to the extent that they apply.\nThis Court should \u201crefrain from concluding here \nthat the differing language in the two [provisions] has \nthe same meaning in each.\u201d Russello, 464 U.S. at 23. \nApplying the negative-implication canon and giving effect \nto the language in each provision of the SRA, the text \ndictates that courts may not consider Section 3553(a)\n\n23\n(2)(A)\u2019s retribution factors when modifying or revoking \nsupervised release.\nII.\t The history of the Sentencing Reform Act and \nsubsequent amendments further demonstrates \nthat Congress intended to preclude courts from \nconsidering Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution \nfactors when modifying or revoking supervised \nrelease.\nAlthough the text alone demonstrates that Section \n3583(e) bars courts from considering the Section 3553(a)\n(2)(A) factors when modifying or revoking supervised \nrelease, the history of the SRA and later amendments \nto Section 3583 confirms this understanding. Congress \ncreated supervised release to promote rehabilitation \nafter a prison term. Subsequent amendments reaffirmed \nCongress\u2019s forward-looking goals, tasking courts with \nmanaging a person\u2019s transition back into society after \nserving their punishment. The revocation provision serves \nthose same goals, giving the sentencing court a tool to \ncompel compliance with the conditions it has determined \nnecessary to rehabilitate the offender and protect the \npublic, but not to impose backward-looking retributive \npunishment.\na.\u2003 For most of the 20th century, federal criminal \nconvictions yielded indeterminate sentences. Mistretta v. \nUnited States, 488 U.S. 361, 363 (1989). Judges imposed \nprison terms, but parole officials could order a person\u2019s \nrelease after serving one-third of the stated term. Tapia, \n564 U.S. at 323. \u201cBoth indeterminate sentencing and \nparole were based on concepts of the offender\u2019s possible, \nindeed probable, rehabilitation, a view that it was realistic \n\n24\nto attempt to rehabilitate the inmate and thereby to \nminimize the risk that he would resume criminal activity \nupon his return to society.\u201d Mistretta, 488 U.S. at 364.\nOver time, Congress abandoned that view. \n\u201cRehabilitation as a sound penological theory came to be \nquestioned and, in any event, was regarded by some as an \nunattainable goal for most cases.\u201d Id. at 365. \u201cLawmakers \nand others increasingly doubted that prison programs \ncould \u2018rehabilitate individuals on a routine basis\u2019\u2014or \nthat parole officers could \u2018determine accurately whether \nor when a particular prisoner had been rehabilitated.\u2019\u201d \nTapia, 564 U.S. at 324 (quoting S. Rep. No. 98-225, at 40 \n(1983)).\nCongress responded by enacting the Sentencing \nReform Act of 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-473, 98 Stat. 1987. \nThe SRA \u201coverhauled federal sentencing procedures to \nmake prison terms more determinate and abolish the \npractice of parole.\u201d United States v. Haymond, 588 U.S. \n634, 651 (2019) (plurality op.). It requires sentencing \njudges to impose prison, probation, or a fine for every \nperson convicted of a federal offense. See 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a03551. And, consistent with Congress\u2019s changed view \non rehabilitation, the SRA instructs judges imposing \nprison terms to \u201crecogniz[e] that imprisonment is not \nan appropriate means of promoting correction and \nrehabilitation.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03582(a). This provision bars \ncourts \u201cfrom imposing or lengthening a prison term in \norder to promote a criminal defendant\u2019s rehabilitation.\u201d \nTapia, 564 U.S. at 321.\nHaving eliminated parole, Congress created \nsupervised release as \u201ca unique method of post-confinement \n\n25\nsupervision.\u201d Gozlon-Peretz, 498 U.S. at 407. Unlike \nparole, a supervised-release term is a separate part of \nthe sentence, imposed at the judge\u2019s discretion, to follow a \ndeterminate prison term. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(c); S. Rep. \nNo. 98-225, at 123 (1983); Fiona Doherty, Indeterminate \nSentencing Returns: The Invention of Supervised \nRelease, 88 N.Y.U.L. Rev. 958, 998 (2013). And unlike \nparole, \u201csupervised release wasn\u2019t introduced to replace a \nportion of the defendant\u2019s prison term, only to encourage \nrehabilitation after the completion of his prison term.\u201d \nHaymond, 588 U.S. at 652 (plurality op.) (emphasis in \noriginal); see also Johnson, 529 U.S. at 59 (\u201cCongress \nintended supervised release to assist individuals in \ntheir transition to community life. Supervised release \nfulfills rehabilitative ends, distinct from those served \nby incarceration.\u201d); S. Rep. No. 98-225, at 124 (\u201c[T]he \nprimary goal of such a term is to ease the defendant\u2019s \ntransition into the community after the service of a long \nprison term for a particularly serious offense, or to provide \nrehabilitation to a defendant who has spent a fairly short \nperiod in prison for punishment or other purposes but still \nneeds supervision and training programs after release.\u201d).\nThe SRA\u2019s text reflects Congress\u2019s different goals \nfor the different sentencing provisions. To punish the \noffender, Congress instructed courts to impose prison, \nprobation, or a fine for every offense. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03551. \nAnd when imposing any of these sanctions, Congress \ninstructed courts to consider all the Section 3553(a)(2) \nfactors, including the retribution factors in Section \n3553(a)(2)(A): the need for the sentence to reflect the \nseriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, \nand to provide just punishment for the offense. See 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03582(a) (prison); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03562(a) (probation); \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03572(a) (fine).\n\n26\nReflecting the rehabilitative goals of supervised \nrelease, though, the SRA instructed courts imposing \nsupervised release not to consider the retribution or \nincapacitation factors in Section 3553(a)(2)(A) or (C), \nby intentionally omitting those provisions from Section \n3583(c)\u2019s list of factors for courts to consider.3 See \nSentencing Reform Act of 1984, \u00a7\u00a03583(c), 98 Stat. at \n1999; S. Rep. No. 98-225, at 124 (\u201cThe Committee has \nconcluded that the sentencing purposes of incapacitation \nand punishment would not be served by a term of \nsupervised release.\u201d). And Congress used the same list, \nreflecting the same goals, when instructing courts what \nto consider when addressing a violation of supervised \nrelease. See Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, \u00a7\u00a03583(e), 98 \nStat. at 2000; see also S. Rep. No. 98-225, at 124 (noting \nthat Section 3583(e) directs the court to \u201cconsider[ ] the \nsame factors considered in the original imposition of a \nterm of supervised release\u201d).\nComparing supervised release with probation is again \ninstructive. Because judges may select probation as the \ncomplete sentence for an offense, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03551, \nCongress instructed courts to consider all the applicable \nSection 3553(a) factors when imposing it, see Sentencing \nReform Act of 1984, \u00a7\u00a0 3562(a), 98 Stat. at 1992. But \nbecause supervised release follows a prison sentence that \nthe sentencing court has concluded satisfies the Section \n3553(a) factors, and because supervised release is a \ndiscretionary supplement that fulfills more limited goals, \nCongress instructed courts not to consider the Section \n3.\u2002 Congress has since amended Section 3583(c) to add Section \n3553(a)(2)(C), the need to protect the public, as a permissible factor. \nSee infra Section II.d.\n\n27\n3553(a)(2)(A) or (C) factors. See Sentencing Reform Act \nof 1984, \u00a7\u00a03583(c), 98 Stat. at 1999; see also S. Rep. No. \n98-225, at 125 (\u201cThe term of supervised release is very \nsimilar to a term of probation, except that it follows a term \nof imprisonment and may not be imposed for purposes of \npunishment or incapacitation since those purposes will \nhave been served to the extent necessary by the term of \nimprisonment.\u201d).\nThe same distinction between probation and supervised \nrelease applies to modification and revocation. Historically, \na probation sentence was based on \u201csuspend[ing] .\u00a0.\u00a0. \na defendant\u2019s prescribed prison term and afford[ing] \nhim a conditional liberty as an \u2018act of grace,\u2019 subject to \nrevocation.\u201d Haymond, 588 U.S. at 643 (plurality op.). \nThe SRA retained from prior practice that probation \n\u201cremains conditional and subject to revocation until its \nexpiration or termination.\u201d Sentencing Reform Act of \n1984, \u00a7\u00a03564(e), 98 Stat. at 1994. Thus, for a probation \nviolation, the SRA instructed courts to consider all the \napplicable Section 3553(a) factors and allowed courts to \neither modify the term or revoke probation and conduct \na plenary resentencing. See Sentencing Reform Act of \n1984, \u00a7\u00a03565(a), 98 Stat. at 1995. For supervised release, \nin contrast, the SRA restricted what factors courts \nmay consider\u2014including precluding consideration of \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution factors\u2014and limited \ncourts\u2019 options for addressing a violation. See Sentencing \nReform Act of 1984, \u00a7\u00a03583(e), 98 Stat. at 2000. Those \ntextual differences convey different meanings that reflect \nCongress\u2019s different goals.\nThis Court has recognized the differences between \nprobation and supervised release in the SRA. United \n\n28\nStates v. Granderson, 511 U.S. 39, 50 (1994) (\u201cSupervised \nrelease, in contrast to probation, is not a punishment in \nlieu of incarceration.\u201d). It has also refused to construe \n\u201cdifferently worded probation and supervised release \nrevocation provisions .\u00a0.\u00a0. in pari materia.\u201d Id. at 51. It \nshould refuse to do so here as well.\nb.\u2003\nConsistent with the rehabilitative goals of \nsupervised release, the SRA originally did not include \nrevocation as an option for a court to address a violation. \nAs first enacted, Section 3583(e) stated that a court \u201cmay, \nafter considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a)\n(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), and (a)(6),\u201d terminate \nsupervised release, modify the conditions, or \u201ctreat a \nviolation of a condition of a term of supervised release as \ncontempt of court pursuant to section 401(3) of this title.\u201d \nSentencing Reform Act of 1984, \u00a7\u00a03583(e), 98 Stat. at \n2000. If a violation constituted a new criminal offense, the \ndefendant could also be prosecuted for that offense. See S. \nRep. No. 98-225, at 125. Once charged with contempt or \nanother offense, the defendant was entitled to full criminal \ndue-process protections, including the right to a jury trial \nif facing imprisonment for more than six months. See Int\u2019l \nUnion, Mine Works of Am. v. Bagwell, 512 U.S. 821, 826-\n27 (1994). If convicted, the defendant would face a new \nsentencing hearing where the court could consider all \nthe relevant sentencing factors, including the retribution \nfactors under Section 3553(a)(2)(A). See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03551. \nBut the SRA did not provide a truncated proceeding by \nwhich a court could impose time in custody for violating \nsupervised-release conditions. See Doherty, supra, at \n999-1000.\nThe original structure of the SRA thus confirms again \nthat, when Congress omitted Section 3553(a)(2)(A) from \n\n29\nthe list in Section 3583(e), it meant to instruct courts not \nto consider those factors. When considering whether \nto terminate or modify supervised release, retributive \npunishment was beside the point, and the court could \nconsider only the listed factors. Only after a separate \nconviction for criminal contempt or a new offense would \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A) come back into play.\nc.\u2003 Before the SRA took effect, Congress amended \nSection 3583(e) to add a revocation option. Even then, it \ndid not amend Section 3583(e)\u2019s list of factors for courts to \nconsider and thus reaffirmed that Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s \nretribution factors remained impermissible.\nThe Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 added new \nparagraph (4) to Section 3583(e), permitting a court to:\nrevoke a term of supervised release, and \nrequire the person to serve in prison all or \npart of the term of supervised release without \ncredit for time previously served on postrelease \nsupervision, if it finds by a preponderance of the \nevidence that the person violated a condition of \nsupervised release, pursuant to the provisions \nof the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure \nthat are applicable to probation revocation and \nto the provisions of applicable policy statements \nissued by the Sentencing Commission.\nAnti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-570, \n\u00a7\u00a0 1006(a)(3)(D), 100 Stat. 3207, 3207-7. Congress later \ndeleted paragraph (3) and its reference to criminal \ncontempt. See Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, Pub. L. \nNo. 100-690, tit. VII, \u00a7\u00a07108(b)(3), 100 Stat. 4181, 4419. \n\n30\nNeither amendment added Section 3553(a)(2)(A) to Section \n3583(e)\u2019s list of factors to consider.\nAlthough the 1986 amendment provided a more direct \nprocedure to imprison those who violated supervised-\nrelease conditions, it did not indicate that retribution was \na permissible consideration. By continuing Section 3553(a)\n(2)(A) as an omitted factor in Section 3583(e)\u2019s list, the 1986 \namendment maintained the prior meaning of that omission \nand provided further evidence that Congress did not \nintend Section 3583(e) to include retributive punishment. \nThe statute continued to \u201csay[ ] what it says\u2014or perhaps \nbetter put here .\u00a0.\u00a0. not say what it does not say.\u201d Cyan, \nInc., 583 U.S. at 426.\nd.\u2003 Since the SRA took effect in 1987, Congress has \nrepeatedly amended Section 3583 to revise the factors for \ncourts to consider when imposing, terminating, modifying, \nor revoking supervised release, but it has never added \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution factors. The Sentencing \nAct of 1987 added Section 3553(a)(2)(C), the need to \nprotect the public, as a factor listed in Section 3583(c) \nfor courts to consider when imposing supervised release. \nSee Sentencing Act of 1987, Pub. L. No. 100-182, \u00a7\u00a09, 101 \nStat. 1266, 1267. The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 added \nthe same provision to Section 3583(e)\u2019s list of factors to \nconsider when modifying or revoking supervised release. \nSee Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, Pub. L. No. 100-690,  tit. \nVII, \u00a7 7108(b)(1), 100 Stat. at 4419. And in 2002, Congress \nadded Section 3553(a)(7), the need to provide restitution, to \nboth Section 3583(c) and (e). See 21st Century Department \nof Justice Appropriations Authorization Act, Pub. L. No. \n107-273, div. B, tit. III, \u00a7\u00a03007, 116 Stat. 1758, 1806 (2002).\n\n31\nCongress thus has shown repeatedly that it adds \nfactors to Section 3583(c) and (e) when it means to \ninstruct courts to consider those factors. None of those \namendments would be necessary if, as the court of appeals \nheld, Sections 3583(c) and (e) already permitted courts to \nconsider any Section 3553(a) factor.\nIII.\tThe interpretation adopted by the court of appeals \nwould raise serious constitutional questions.\nConstruing Section 3583(e) as the court of appeals did \nwould threaten to violate the Constitution. If left to stand, \nthe decisions below would allow district courts to impose \nretributive punishment for violating supervised-release \nconditions. As this Court has observed, \u201cconstruing \nrevocation and reimprisonment as punishment for the \nviolation of the conditions of supervised release\u201d would \nraise \u201cserious constitutional questions.\u201d Johnson v. United \nStates, 529 U.S. 694, 700 (2000). For one, \u201cviolative conduct \nneed not be criminal and need only be found by a judge \nunder a preponderance of the evidence standard, not by a \njury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id.; see also Haymond, \n588 U.S. at 650 (plurality op.) (\u201cIf the government were \nright, a jury\u2019s conviction on one crime would .\u00a0.\u00a0. permit \nperpetual supervised release and allow the government to \nevade the need for another jury trial on any other offense \nthe defendant might commit, no matter how grave the \npunishment.\u201d); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0841 (authorizing a supervised \nrelease term of up to life for distributing any amount of \na controlled substance in schedules I through IV). Also, \n\u201c[w]here the acts of violation are criminal in their own \nright, they may be the basis for separate prosecution, \nwhich would raise an issue of double jeopardy if the \nrevocation of supervised release were also punishment \nfor the same offense.\u201d Johnson, 529 U.S. at 700.\n\n32\n\u201cTreating postrevocation sanctions as part of the \npenalty for the initial offense, however (as most courts \nhave done), avoids these difficulties.\u201d Id. But the same \ndifficulties arise if courts expressly impose retributive \npunishment for a violation, as happened here. See JA 244a. \nThe statute as written raises no such problems. As the \ntext dictates and as Congress intended, Section 3583(e) \nprecludes courts from considering the retribution factors \nin Section 3553(a)(2)(A) when revoking supervised release.\nIV.\tIn the plain text of Section 3583(e), Congress \nprovided a workable, forward-looking framework \nfor courts to follow when modifying or revoking \nsupervised release.\nThe court of appeals concluded that it would be \n\u201cunworkable\u201d for courts to avoid considering Section \n3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution factors both when imposing \nsupervised release and when modifying or revoking \nsupervised release. See JA 128a, 130a. That is mistaken.\nTake Section 3583(c) first, which governs what factors \ncourts may consider when imposing supervised release. \nApplying the text\u2019s plain meaning, courts may not \nconsider the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors when imposing \nsupervised release. The court of appeals suggested this \nwould be possible only if the judge \u201cadjourn[ed] the \nhearing after imposing a sentence,\u201d then \u201cstart[ed] over \nwith a new unblemished inquiry into the right term of \nsupervised release.\u201d JA 130a. It reasoned that \u201cCongress \ncould not have expected courts to wipe their minds of \nthese concerns when they move from one type of sentence \nto the other.\u201d Id.\n\n33\nThis Court has twice said otherwise. See Concepcion, \n597 U.S. at 495; Tapia, 564 U.S. at 326. Nothing about \nthat is unworkable. Judges are well able to apply different \nconsiderations for different purposes. Cf. Williams v. \nIllinois, 567 U.S. 50, 69 (2012) (\u201cWhen the judge sits \nas the trier of fact, it is presumed that the judge will \nunderstand the limited reason for the disclosure of the \nunderlying inadmissible information and will not rely on \nthat information for any improper purpose.\u201d). And other \ncourts of appeals have laid out workable guidelines for \nensuring that sentencing courts differentiate between \ntheir reasons for prison and for supervised release. See, \ne.g., United States v. Wilcher, 91 F.4th 864, 872 (7th Cir. \n2024) (\u201cTo help navigate this area, we have encouraged \ndistrict courts to separate out their discussions of prison \ntime and supervised release when the reason for imposing \none cannot apply to the other.\u201d); United States v. Burden, \n860 F.3d 45, 57 (2d Cir. 2017) (noting that, when a court \nbases its prison sentence substantially on the Section \n3553(a)(2)(A) factors, \u201cit would be advisable for the \ndistrict court to separately state its reasons for the term \nof supervised release imposed\u201d).\nConcerning modifying or revoking supervised release \nunder Section 3583(e), the court of appeals said that \ndisregarding the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors would be \nunworkable in a different way\u2014because \u201cthe purportedly \nforbidden considerations mentioned in \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A) \ntend to be essentially redundant with the permitted \nones.\u201d JA 128a (internal quotation marks omitted). But \nthat reasoning proves the opposite, and it highlights the \nimportance of applying the text as written, consistent with \nCongress\u2019s intent. If other factors address much of what \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A) covers, there is little reason to rely \n\n34\non the (a)(2)(A) factors. And what (a)(2)(A) covers that is \nnot covered by the other factors is crucial: factors related \nto retributive punishment. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A) \n(\u201cthe need for the sentence imposed .\u00a0.\u00a0. to reflect the \nseriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, \nand to provide just punishment for the offense\u201d); Tapia, \n564 U.S. at 325 (noting that Section 3553(a)(2)(A) reflects \nretribution as a purpose of sentencing).\nExcluding the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors thus allows \ncourts to consider all relevant information, but filtered \nthrough only the purposes of sentencing that Congress has \ndetermined apply when modifying or revoking supervised \nrelease: deterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation, but \nnot retribution. See Tapia, 564 U.S. at 325. For example, \ncourts may consider \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the \noffense,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(1), as it relates to any other \npermissible factor. But the seriousness of the offense, 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A), is not the same as the nature and \ncircumstances, and Congress distinguished between the \ntwo by placing them in separate subsections in Section \n3553(a). See Kungys v. United States, 485 U.S. 759, 778 \n(1988) (opinion of Scalia, J.) (noting the \u201ccardinal rule \nof statutory interpretation that no provision should be \nconstrued to be entirely redundant\u201d). The nature and \ncircumstances of the offense may relate to any sentencing \npurpose; in Section 3553(a)(2)(A), seriousness relates to \nretributive punishment. See Tapia, 564 U.S. at 325; Miqbel, \n444 F.3d at 1182 (noting that the need to promote respect \nfor the law and reflect the seriousness of the offense \u201cis \noften intertwined with the concept of punishment, as it is \nin \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(A) itself \u201d). Congress excluded the latter, \nand any overlap between Section 3553(a)(2)(A) and the \nother factors makes it all the more important for courts to \n\n35\navoid relying on the impermissible consideration inherent \nto (a)(2)(A): retributive punishment.\nNothing about Section 3583(c) or (e) as written is \nunworkable. District courts simply must rely only on the \nlisted factors, fulfilling Congress\u2019s forward-looking goals \nfor supervised release. Retributive punishment is an \ninherently backward-looking analysis, examining what a \nperson did and determining what sanction is appropriate \nin retribution. Supervised release is a forward-looking \nproject, giving courts tools to manage a person\u2019s transition \nback into society by imposing conditions to rehabilitate the \noffender and protect the public. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(c). \nSection 3583(e) gives courts an additional tool to compel \ncompliance with those conditions, allowing modification \nor revocation based on those same goals\u2014for example, \nto provide needed correctional treatment, 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(D), or to protect the public from further \noffenses, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03553(a)(2)(C). See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(e). \nViewing supervised release as a forward-looking project, \nas Congress intended, does not present courts with an \nunworkable task. It reflects Congress\u2019s statutory design, \nand courts \u201cmust implement the design Congress chose.\u201d \nLora v. United States, 599 U.S. 453, 464 (2023).\nThis Court should give effect to the SRA\u2019s text and \nhold that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a03583(e) precludes district courts from \nconsidering Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s retribution factors \nwhen modifying or revoking supervised release.\n\n36\nCONCLUSION\nThe judgments of the court of appeals should be \nreversed.\nRespectfully submitted,\nDecember 2024\nJoseph Medici\nFederal Public Defender,\nSouthern District of Ohio\nKevin M.

The or-\nder of the district court (J.A. 247a-248a) is unreported. \n\n2 \n \nJURISDICTION \nIn Esteras\u2019s case, the amended judgment of the \ncourt of appeals was entered on December 20, 2023.  Pe-\ntitions for rehearing were denied on December 20, 2023 \n(J.A. 136a-149a) and March 7, 2024 (J.A. 150a-154a).  In \nLeaks\u2019s and Jaimez\u2019s cases, the judgments of the court \nof appeals were entered, respectively, on March 6, 2024, \nand on March 12, 2024.  The petition for a writ of certi-\norari, see Sup. Ct. R. 12.4, was filed on May 15, 2024, \nand was granted on October 21, 2024.  The jurisdiction \nof this Court rests on 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe supervised-release revocation provision, 18 \nU.S.C. 3583(e)(3), provides in pertinent part: \n(e) \nMODIFICATION \nOF \nCONDITIONS \nOR  \nREVOCATION\u2014The court may, after considering the \nfactors set forth in section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), \n(a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7)\u2014 \n* * * \n \n(3) revoke a term of supervised release, and re-\nquire the defendant to serve in prison all or part \nof the term of supervised release authorized by \nstatute for the offense that resulted in such term \nof supervised release without credit for time pre-\nviously served on postrelease supervision, if the \ncourt, pursuant to the Federal Rules of Criminal \nProcedure applicable to revocation of probation \nor supervised release, finds by a preponderance \nof the evidence that the defendant violated a con-\ndition of supervised release  * * *  . \nOther relevant statutory provisions are reprinted in an \nappendix to this brief.  App., infra, 1a-10a. \n\n3 \n \nSTATEMENT \nFollowing guilty pleas in separate cases in the \nUnited States District Court for the Northern District \nof Ohio, each petitioner was sentenced to a term of im-\nprisonment to be followed by a term of supervised re-\nlease.  In 2023, after each petitioner violated one or \nmore terms of his supervised release, the district court \nrevoked each petitioner\u2019s supervised release and re-\nquired reimprisonment.  J.A. 110a-116a, 227a-228a, \n247a-248a.  In each case, the court of appeals affirmed.  \nJ.A. 121a-135a, 229a-236a, 249a-251a. \nA. Legal Background \n1. In the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (Sentenc-\ning Reform Act), Pub. L. No. 98-473, Tit. II, ch. II,  \n\u00a7 212(a)(2), 98 Stat. 1987, Congress enacted \u201csweeping \nreforms\u201d to the nation\u2019s criminal justice system.  Mis-\ntretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 366 (1989).  Among \nthose reforms was the introduction of supervised re-\nlease into the federal criminal system to replace \u201cmost \nforms of parole.\u201d  Cornell Johnson v. United States, 529 \nU.S. 694, 696 (2000). \nSupervised release is \u201ca form of postconfinement \nmonitoring\u201d that \u201cfacilitate[s] a transition to commu-\nnity life\u201d after a term of imprisonment.  Mont v. United \nStates, 587 U.S. 514, 523 (2019) (citation and internal quo-\ntation marks omitted); see S. Rep. No. 225, 98th Cong., \n1st Sess. 125 (1983) (Senate Report).  It allows offenders \nto serve \u201cpart of the[ir] sentence\u201d out of prison, subject  \nto conditions on their behavior.  18 U.S.C. 3583(a); see \n18 U.S.C. 3583(d).  Some conditions, such as not com-\nmitting additional crimes and drug testing, are manda-\ntory; the court also has discretion to specify additional \nconditions.  See 18 U.S.C. 3583(d). \n\n4 \n \n2. As originally enacted in the Sentencing Reform \nAct, the supervised-release statute (18 U.S.C. 3583) \nprovided a mechanism for early termination of the  \nsupervised-release term (thereby discharging the of-\nfender from the requirements of supervision), as well as \nmechanisms for otherwise adjusting the length and con-\nditions of the supervised-release term.  See Sentencing \nReform Act, 98 Stat. 2000.  But the statute did not pro-\nvide a mechanism for revoking a term of supervised re-\nlease in the event of a violation.  See Sentencing Reform \nAct, 98 Stat. 1999-2000; Senate Report 125.  Instead, it \nauthorized the court to treat a violation \u201cas contempt of \ncourt pursuant to [18 U.S.C. 401(3)].\u201d  Sentencing Re-\nform Act, 98 Stat. 2000. \nIn the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-\n570, 100 Stat. 3207, Congress amended Section 3583(e) \nto add what is now Section 3583(e)(3).  The new provi-\nsion allowed a court to revoke an offender\u2019s supervised \nrelease, and require a term of reimprisonment, if the of-\nfender violated one or more conditions of his release.  \nSee ibid.  The primary purpose of that provision is to \nallow a court to \u201csanction\u201d an offender\u2019s \u201cbreach of trust\u201d \nin committing such a violation.  Sentencing Guidelines \nCh. 7, Pt. A, \u00a7 3(b); see Sentencing Guidelines Ch. 7, Pt. \nB, intro. comment. (setting out \u201cpenalties  * * *  for the \nviolation of the judicial order imposing supervision\u201d); \nsee also Cornell Johnson, 529 U.S. at 700-701.  The term \nof reimprisonment is attributable \u201cto the original con-\nviction,\u201d rather than a sentence for a new offense.  Cor-\nnell Johnson, 529 U.S. at 701. \n3. The provision governing the imposition of a term \nof imprisonment, Section 3582(a), provides that a court, \n\u201cin determining whether to impose a term of imprison-\nment, and, if a term of imprisonment is to be imposed, \n\n5 \n \nin determining the length of the term, shall consider the \nfactors set forth in [18 U.S.C.] 3553(a) to the extent that \nthey are applicable, recognizing that imprisonment is \nnot an appropriate means of promoting correction and \nrehabilitation.\u201d  Section 3553 lists a number of factors \nthat a \u201ccourt, in determining the particular sentence to \nbe imposed, shall consider.\u201d  18 U.S.C. 3553(a).   \nMultiple provisions of the supervised-release statute \ncross-reference subsets of the Section 3553(a) factors.  \nMost relevant here, Section 3583(c) states that a court, \n\u201cin determining whether to include a term of supervised \nrelease, and, if a term of supervised release is to be in-\ncluded, in determining the length of the term and the \nconditions of supervised release, shall consider the fac-\ntors set forth in section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), \n(a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7).\u201d  18 U.S.C. \n3583(c).  The same factors are then listed, in slightly dif-\nferent language, as considerations under Section 3583(e), \nwhich covers termination, extension, modification, and \ndiscretionary revocation of supervised release.  See 18 \nU.S.C. 3583(e).  In the revocation context, the statute \nstates that a court \u201cmay, after considering the factors set \nforth in section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), \n(a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7)  * * *  revoke a term of \nsupervised release, and require the defendant to serve\u201d \na term of imprisonment.  18 U.S.C. 3583(e)(3). \nThe factors cross-referenced in Section 3583(c) and  \nSection 3583(e) include the \u201cnature and circumstances \nof the offense\u201d and \u201cthe history and characteristics of \nthe defendant,\u201d 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(1); the need for the \nsentence imposed to \u201cadequate[ly] deter[]\u201d crime and \n\u201cprotect the public,\u201d 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2)(B) and (C); \nthe need to \u201cprovide the defendant with needed educa-\n\n6 \n \ntional or vocational training, medical care, or other cor-\nrectional treatment,\u201d 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2)(D); \u201cthe kinds \nof sentence and the sentencing range\u201d recommended by \nthe Sentencing Guidelines, 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(4)(A); per-\ntinent \u201cpolicy statements\u201d issued by the Sentencing \nCommission for \u201cviolation[s] of probation or supervised \nrelease,\u201d 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(4)(B); other pertinent policy \nstatements issued by the Sentencing Commission, 18 \nU.S.C. 3553(a)(5)(A); the need to avoid unwarranted \nsentence disparities, 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(6); and the need \nto provide restitution to victims, 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(7). \nThe factors that a court is required to consider when \nimposing a sentence for a criminal conviction, but that \nare not cross-referenced in Section 3583(e), are the  \nfactors set out in Section 3553(a)(2)(A) and Section \n3553(a)(3).  Those non-cross-referenced factors are \u201cthe \nneed for the sentence imposed  * * *  to reflect the seri-\nousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, \nand to provide just punishment for the offense,\u201d 18 \nU.S.C. 3553(a)(2)(A), and \u201cthe kinds of sentences avail-\nable,\u201d 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(3). \n4. In some circumstances, such as when an offender \nviolates his supervised release by possessing drugs or a \nfirearm, revocation and reimprisonment are mandatory \nunder 18 U.S.C. 3583(g).  Section 3583(g) caps that term \nof reimprisonment at the maximum authorized under \nSection 3583(e)(3), but does not provide a particular set \nof factors for a court to consider in determining how \nlong that term should be. \n\n7 \n \nB. Factual And Procedural Background \n1. Esteras\u2019s Revocation Proceedings \na. In 2018, petitioner Esteras pleaded guilty to con-\nspiring to distribute and to possess with intent to dis-\ntribute heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1) and \n846.  J.A. 110a, 122a.  The district court varied below the \nrecommendation of the Sentencing Guidelines to im-\npose a sentence consisting of 12 months of imprison-\nment (to run consecutively to a 15-month prison term \nfor violating his probation for a prior federal drug- \ntrafficking conviction), to be followed by six years of su-\npervised release.  J.A. 122a. \nIn January 2020, Esteras was released from prison \nand began serving his six-year term of supervised re-\nlease.  J.A. 122a.  In January 2023, the Probation Office \nreported to the district court that Esteras had violated \nterms of his supervised release by (1) committing do-\nmestic violence, aggravated menacing, and criminal dam-\naging in violation of state law, and (2) possessing a fire-\narm.  J.A. 112a, 122a.  The report stated that, on Janu-\nary 23, 2023, Esteras had struck the mother of his chil-\ndren in the head, pointed a handgun at her, threatened \nto kill her, and fired three rounds from his handgun into \nher vehicle.  J.A. 112a. \nFollowing a revocation hearing, the district court \nfound that Esteras had \u201cbrandished and shot a firearm\u201d \nin the manner that the victim had described, as memo-\nrialized in body-camera video evidence.  J.A. 93a.  And \nthe court explained that whether or not Esteras had vi-\nolated state law, he had \u201cviolated [his] term of supervi-\nsion by possessing a [firearm].\u201d  J.A. 94a.  The court was \nthus \u201cobligated,  * * *  pursuant to [Section 3583(g)], to \nrevoke\u201d Esteras\u2019s supervision.  J.A. 93a; see 18 U.S.C. \n3583(g). \n\n8 \n \nBefore deciding on the appropriate course for \nEsteras\u2019s supervised-release violation, the district \ncourt recounted Esteras\u2019s prior federal offenses, noted \nthat Esteras was \u201cno stranger to federal court\u201d or to \n\u201claw violations,\u201d and observed that \u201cwhat\u2019s been done \nbefore [wa]sn\u2019t sufficient enough to deter [him], to en-\ncourage [him] to be respectful of the law, to be law- \nabiding.\u201d  J.A. 96a.  In particular, the court \u201cworr[ied]\u201d \nthat sentences for previous drug crimes, and revocation \nof a prior term of supervised release, had failed \u201cto de-\nter [Esteras], to encourage [him] to be respectful of the \nlaw.\u201d  Ibid.  And the court was \u201cnot really sure what it \nwill require for [Esteras] to learn that enough is \nenough.\u201d  Ibid. \nThe district court stated that it would now \u201cescalate \nthe consequences\u201d by \u201cexercising [its] discretion to vary \nupwards\u201d from the term of reimprisonment recom-\nmended by the Sentencing Guidelines, because Esteras\u2019s \n\u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cdisrespectful\u201d behavior was \u201c[a]typi-\ncal\u201d and \u201cexceptional\u201d and \u201cmust stop.\u201d  J.A. 97a-98a.  \nThe court explained that if Esteras could not \u201cstop \n[him]self,\u201d the court would \u201cseparate [him] from society \nfor long enough to at least allow [him] to reconsider his \nbehavior,\u201d so that \u201chopefully when [he] return[s] under \nthe new term of supervision\u201d that would follow the re-\nimprisonment, he would \u201cdo better.\u201d  J.A. 98a. \nThe district court required 24 months of imprison-\nment, to be followed by three more years of supervised \nrelease.  J.A. 98a.  As to the latter, the court carried \nover Esteras\u2019s prior conditions of supervised release \nand added requirements that Esteras submit to an an-\nger management program and that he \u201cbe on location \nmonitoring with a curfew\u201d for the first six months of his \nnew supervised-release term.  J.A. 99a, 101a.  The court \n\n9 \n \nnoted that Esteras\u2019s reimprisonment term was \u201cnot \nlong enough for the most intensive drug treatment pro-\ngram,\u201d but expressed hope that Esteras would \u201csign up \nand apply [him]self to any programs\u201d available.  J.A. \n104a. \nEsteras objected to any consideration of factors \nidentified in 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2014including the \nneed to promote \u201crespect for the law\u201d and to reflect the \n\u201cseriousness\u201d of, and provide \u201cjust punishment for[,] \nthe offense\u201d\u2014which are not explicitly cross-referenced \nin the revocation-and-reimprisonment provision, 18 \nU.S.C. 3583(e)(3).  See J.A. 105a.  In response, the dis-\ntrict court acknowledged that its revocation term was \npremised in part on \u201cpromot[ing] respect for the law\u201d \nand \u201cdeterring\u201d Esteras, but made clear that it also \nrested on the court\u2019s \u201cconcern about the safety of the \ncommunity\u201d and the need to distinguish Esteras from a \n\u201ctypical\u201d offender.  J.A. 105a-106a.  In a subsequent \nwritten order (J.A. 110a-116a), the court stated that it \nhad considered the factors in Sections 3553(a) and 3583(d) \n(which governs conditions of supervised release), and \nstated that the revocation term was based on, \u201camong \nother reasons,\u201d the need \u201cto protect society and pro-\nmote respect for the law.\u201d  J.A. 115a-116a. \nb. The court of appeals initially affirmed the  \nsupervised-release-revocation judgment in an un-\npublished order.  J.A. 121a-135a.  The court later \namended and reissued the order as a published disposi-\ntion.  Ibid. \nThe court of appeals rejected Esteras\u2019s claim that a \ndistrict court is prohibited from considering Section \n3553(a)(2)(A) factors when revoking supervised release \nand requiring a term of reimprisonment.  J.A. 127a-\n135a.  The court of appeals explained that, as a \u201ctextual\u201d \n\n10 \n \nmatter, while Section 3583(e) requires a district court to \n\u201cconsider[] the listed factors\u201d in its decisionmaking, the \nprovision is unlike other sentencing provisions in that it \n\u201cnever says that the court may consider \u2018only\u2019 those fac-\ntors.\u201d  J.A. 128a (citation omitted).  The court of appeals \nfound that omission particularly pertinent because, in a \nnearby statute, Congress used an \u201cexpress command\u201d \nto instruct a court \u201cto disregard the goal of rehabilita-\ntion\u201d when imposing a term of imprisonment.  Ibid. (cit-\ning 18 U.S.C. 3582(a)). \nThe court of appeals also explained that a \u201cproposed \nbright-line rule\u201d forbidding consideration of Section \n3553(a)(2)(A) factors \u201cwas unworkable,\u201d because \u201cthe \npurportedly forbidden considerations mentioned in \n[Section] 3553(a)(2)(A) tend to be \u2018essentially redun-\ndant\u2019 with the permitted ones.\u201d  J.A. 128a (citation omit-\nted).  \u201cTo think about the one,\u201d the court observed, \u201cre-\nquires the judge to think about the other.\u201d  Ibid.  And \nthe court of appeals identified several examples illus-\ntrating that \u201cEsteras\u2019s [proposed] bright-line rule is un-\nworkable.\u201d  J.A. 130a; see J.A. 128a-130a.  For example, \nthe court observed that Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s alleg-\nedly impermissible \u201c\u200a\u2018seriousness of the offense\u2019\u200a\u201d factor \n\u201caligns with [Section] 3553(a)(1) and its emphasis on \n\u2018the nature and circumstances of the offense,\u2019\u200a\u201d which \nSection 3583(e) expressly requires the district court to \nconsider.  J.A. 128a. \nThe court of appeals additionally observed that Sec-\ntion 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s allegedly impermissible \u201cneed \u2018to \npromote respect for the law\u2019\u200a\u201d factor \u201cmeshes with the \nrationale that revoking supervised release will \u2018help\u2019 the \ndefendant \u2018learn to obey the conditions of his supervised \nrelease.\u2019\u200a\u201d  J.A. 129a (citation omitted).  The court of ap-\npeals emphasized that \u201c[t]o neglect the one dishonors \n\n11 \n \nthe other,\u201d noting that the district court \u201cquite under-\nstandably could not see how she could ignore respect for \nthe law but consider a defendant\u2019s need to respect the \nterms of supervised release.\u201d  Ibid. \nAs a third example of overlap, the court of appeals \nobserved that Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s allegedly imper-\nmissible \u201cjust punishment for the offense\u201d factor paral-\nlels considerations that Section 3553(a)(5) requires the \ndistrict court to consider.  J.A. 129a.  Specifically, the \ncourt reasoned that a district court \u201ccannot\u201d adhere to \nSection 3553(a)(5)\u2019s requirement to consider various \n\u201c\u200a\u2018pertinent policy statement[s]\u2019 of the Sentencing Com-\nmission,\u201d which instruct that a court must impose a rev-\nocation term that reflects the breach of trust occasioned \nby the original sentence, \u201cwithout accounting for the \nconduct that violated supervised release.\u201d  Ibid. \nc. On the same day that the panel issued its amended \norder, the court of appeals denied a petition for rehear-\ning en banc that Esteras had filed following the initial \nunpublished order.  J.A. 136a-149a.  Judge Moore dis-\nsented from that denial, on the view that the panel de-\ncision was incorrect.  J.A. 137a-148a.  Judge Griffin, \njoined by Judge Bloomekatz, took the view that rehear-\ning was warranted, but did not state that the panel had \nerred.  J.A. 137a, 148a-149a. \nThe court of appeals later denied Esteras\u2019s petition \nfor rehearing of the panel\u2019s amended order.  J.A. 150a-\n154a.  Judge Moore, joined by Judge Stranch, restated \nher belief that the panel decision was incorrect.  J.A. \n151a-152a.  Judge Griffin, joined by Judges Stranch and \nBloomekatz, restated his view that rehearing was war-\nranted but again did not opine that the panel erred.  J.A. \n152a-154a. \n\n12 \n \n2. Jaimez\u2019s Revocation Proceedings  \na. From 2002 to 2010, petitioner Jaimez (formerly \nknown as Timothy Watters), transported cocaine and \nmarijuana from Texas and Michigan to Ohio, where he \ndistributed the drugs.  10-cr-4 Presentence Investiga-\ntion Report (PSR) \u00b6\u00b6 4-60 (Nov. 20, 2013).  A federal \ngrand jury indicted him on drug charges, and Jaimez \npleaded guilty to conspiring to possess cocaine, cocaine \nbase, and marijuana with intent to distribute, in viola-\ntion of 21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1) and 846.  10-cr-4 Amended \nJudgment 1 (Mar. 11, 2015); see 10-cr-4 Indictment.  \nThe district court sentenced Jaimez to 120 months of \nimprisonment, to be followed by five years of supervised \nrelease.  10-cr-4 Amended Judgment 2-3. \nAfter Jaimez was released from prison and started \nhis term of supervised release, he \u201cused drugs, failed to \nmaintain employment, and failed to truthfully disclose \nfinancial information to his probation officer.\u201d  J.A. \n230a.  In September 2019, the district court revoked \nJaimez\u2019s supervised release and required a 14-month \nterm of reimprisonment, to be followed by three years \nof supervised release.  10-cr-4 Order (Sept. 5, 2019); see \nJ.A. 230a.   \nb. After Jaimez was re-released from prison and \nstarted his second term of supervised release, he re-\nturned to drug dealing.  J.A. 230a.  Police officers found \nJaimez \u201ctransporting marijuana in his car with the co-\nfelons from his original conviction.\u201d  Ibid.  \u201cAnd at \nJaimez\u2019s properties, police found cocaine base, a shell \ncasing, and a drug press.\u201d  Ibid.  Based on that conduct, \nJaimez was convicted in Ohio state court of attempting \nto transport marijuana.  Ibid.   \nAfter the federal Probation Office moved for revoca-\ntion of Jaimez\u2019s supervised release, Jaimez admitted to \n\n13 \n \nviolating his supervised-release conditions by traffick-\ning drugs, associating with a convicted felon, and pos-\nsessing drug paraphernalia.  10-cr-4 D. Ct. Doc. 342, at \n1-2 (Apr. 20, 2022) (Violation Report); see J.A. 228a.  \nThe district court revoked Jaimez\u2019s supervised release \nand required a within-Guidelines term of 60 months of \nreimprisonment, to be followed by six years of addi-\ntional supervised release.  Ibid.; see J.A. 215a-216a. \nThe district court stated that its \u201creasons\u201d were \u201cto \nprotect the public,\u201d \u201cto encourage understanding of \ncompliance of the terms and conditions,\u201d and to foster \n\u201cindividual deterrence\u201d and \u201cpublic deterrence.\u201d  J.A. \n218a.  The court observed that Jaimez had \u201cnow twice\u201d \nshown that he treats \u201cthe terms and conditions of su-\npervised release [as] optional\u201d and that the discovery of \nJaimez and his former drug-dealing compatriots with a \n\u201cgarbage bag\u201d containing \u201cupward[s] of a kilo\u201d of mari-\njuana illustrated that Jaimez was \u201cpaying no attention\u201d \nto those conditions.  J.A. 216a-217a. \nThe district court noted that the revocation term \nwould emphasize to Jaimez and \u201cthe public generally\u201d \nthat such conditions are mandatory and that violating \nthem means that \u201cyou\u2019re going to get punished\u201d and \nmay receive meaningful \u201cprison time.\u201d  J.A. 216a-217a; \nsee J.A. 218a (reiterating that reasons for the revoca-\ntion term were \u201cto protect the public  * * *  to encourage \nunderstanding of compliance of the terms and condi-\ntions, individual deterrence, and public deterrence\u201d and \nto make clear that there \u201cis a consequence of not obey-\ning a court order\u201d).  And the court observed that \u201csome-\nbody looking at this with the overall circumstances \nwould find that this is both a just and deserved sanction, \nand would hope that it would enhance respect for the \n\n14 \n \nlaw.\u201d  Ibid.  Jaimez did not object to the factors that the \ncourt had considered.  J.A. 221a. \nc. The court of appeals affirmed.  J.A. 229a-236a.  \nThe court rejected Jaimez\u2019s argument that the district \ncourt impermissibly relied on Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s \nfactors by considering \u201cthe seriousness of his offense, \nthe promotion of respect for the law, and the provision \nof just punishment.\u201d  J.A. 232a.  The court based that \nrejection on its prior decisions, including the decision in \npetitioner Esteras\u2019s case.  Ibid. \n3. Leaks\u2019s Revocation Proceedings \nIn 2019, petitioner Leaks was arrested after police \nofficers stopped his vehicle and discovered a machinegun \nunder his seat with 15-, 20-, and 30-round-capacity mag-\nazines containing a total of 21 rounds of ammunition.  \n19-cr-283 PSR \u00b6\u00b6 7-14.  Leaks pleaded guilty to two \ncounts of unlawfully possessing a machinegun, in viola-\ntion of 18 U.S.C. 922(o) and 924(a)(2) (2018).  J.A. 250a.  \nThe district court sentenced Leaks to 30 months of im-\nprisonment, to be followed by three years of supervised \nrelease.  Ibid. \nIn July 2021, Leaks was released from prison and be-\ngan serving his term of supervised release.  23-3547 \nGov\u2019t C.A. Br. 5.  In 2023, the Probation Office reported \nto the district court that Leaks had committed several \nsupervised-release violations, including state unlawful-\nfirearm-possession and robbery offenses that had re-\nsulted in state sentences of, respectively, three years \nand four-to-six years of imprisonment.  J.A. 239a-240a, \n250a. \nLeaks subsequently admitted, and the federal dis-\ntrict court found, that he had committed five violations \nof his federal supervised release: the two above- \n\n15 \n \nmentioned state-law crimes, failing to report for super-\nvision, failing to attend mental-health treatment, and \nfailing to work toward a GED.  J.A. 76a, 241a.  Leaks \nalso acknowledged that because he had admitted to a \nfirearm offense, \u201cthe [c]ourt [wa]s required by statute \nto impose a term of imprisonment.\u201d  J.A. 241a; see 18 \nU.S.C. 3583(g).  But Leaks requested that the court run \nthe term of imprisonment concurrent with, not consec-\nutive to, the state-court sentences for his state-law vio-\nlations.  J.A. 241a.  \nIn deciding on the revocation term, the district court \nnoted that Leaks\u2019s \u201coriginal [federal] offense\u201d for which \nsupervision was ordered \u201cinvolved a machine gun\u201d and \nthat Leaks\u2019s two \u201cnew law violations[] both involv[ed] \nfirearms.\u201d  J.A. 244a.  The court also noted that Leaks \nhad committed a total of \u201cfive violations\u201d while on su-\npervised release.  Ibid.  And the court agreed with \u201call \nof the statements made by [government counsel],\u201d ibid., \nwho had noted that Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 7B1.3(f) \nprovided for a consecutive term of imprisonment, J.A. \n242a; see Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 7B1.3(f) (2018). \nThe district court also stated that \u201c[c]oncurrent \ntime\u201d would \u201cnot [be] justice\u201d and would \u201cnot punish \nMr. Leaks for violating supervision.\u201d  J.A. 244a.  The \ncourt required a within-Guidelines term of 12 months of \nimprisonment to be served, consistent with the Guide-\nlines, \u201cconsecutive[ly] to the time being served in the \ntwo state cases,\u201d with no further term of supervised re-\nlease to follow the reimprisonment.  Ibid.; see J.A. 248a.   \nLeaks objected to the district court\u2019s \u201cconsideration \nof punishment\u201d on the ground that Section 3583 \u201cspecif-\nically omits\u201d Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors from consid-\nerations.  J.A. 241a, 245a.  The court acknowledged that \n\n16 \n \nobjection but did not alter the revocation term or its as-\nsessment of why that term was warranted.  See J.A. \n245a-246a.  When Leaks raised a similar objection on \nappeal, the court of appeals affirmed based on circuit \nprecedent.  J.A. 249a-251a. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe court of appeals correctly recognized that Sec-\ntion 3583(e)(3) requires a court to consider certain fac-\ntors before revoking supervised release, but does not \nforeclose the court from considering other factors that \nare traditionally within the scope of a court\u2019s wide dis-\ncretion.  Such other factors include those in 18 U.S.C. \n3553(a)(2)(A), which are not listed in Section 3583(e)(3), \nbut inherently overlap with the factors that are.  Section \n3583(e)(3) does not mandate that a court do the impos-\nsible:  consider the mandatory factors disentangled \nfrom the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors.  Instead, Section \n3583(e)(3) leaves unimpeded a court\u2019s authority to con-\nsider additional factors that are relevant and helpful to \nachieving a just result.  \nA. Courts have long had broad discretion in what \nthey may consider at sentencing proceedings and pro-\nceedings to modify sentences\u2014discretion that plainly \napplies here.  And as this Court has repeatedly recog-\nnized, that broad authority is unlimited absent an ex-\npress limitation.  Section 3583(e)(3), however, contains \nno such limitation. \nSection 3583(e)(3) authorizes a court to revoke su-\npervised release \u201cafter considering the factors set forth \nin section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), \n(a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7).\u201d  18 U.S.C. 3583(e).  The text \nmakes clear that the court must consider enumerated \nfactors as a prerequisite to revocation.  But it does not \n\n17 \n \nlimit a court\u2019s authority to consider other, unlisted fac-\ntors, such as the factors set out in Section 3553(a)(2)(A). \nIf Congress had wanted to prohibit consideration of \nunlisted factors, it could have authorized courts to re-\nvoke supervised release \u201cafter considering only the \n[listed] factors.\u201d  But Congress did not include such a \nprohibitory term in Section 3583(e)(3)\u2014even though it \ndid do so elsewhere in Section 3583.  And this Court has \nrepeatedly made clear that it will not read the word \n\u201conly\u201d into a statute when Congress has declined to in-\nclude that term.  Doing so here would be particularly \nunwarranted because it would create a disparity with \nanother revocation provision, 18 U.S.C. 3583(g), which \nplainly does allow consideration of all Section 3553(a) \nfactors. \nSection 3583(e)(3)\u2019s language also contrasts sharply \nwith the language Congress has used to limit courts\u2019 au-\nthority in related contexts, both within and without Sec-\ntion 3583, such as \u201cexcept that\u201d clauses, language ex-\nplicitly prohibiting consideration of certain factors, and \nclauses directing that the outcome fulfill some limited \nset of purposes.  See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. 3553(a), (b)(1) and \n(2); 18 U.S.C. 3563(b); 18 U.S.C. 3582(a); 18 U.S.C. \n3583(f).  Congress had numerous models for the type of \nlimitation that petitioners would impose here; it did not \nadopt any of them, or any equivalently explicit indicator \nof preclusive intent. \nPetitioners nonetheless assert that Congress meant \nto limit courts\u2019 discretion purely through negative im-\nplication.  But petitioners cannot explain why Congress \nwould be so oblique in a context in which wide discretion \nand express limits are the norm.  In any event, they \ndraw the wrong inference.  It is reasonable to infer that \n\n18 \n \nby directing a court to decide on revocation \u201cafter con-\nsidering\u201d the listed factors, a court may not decide the \nissue \u201cbefore,\u201d or \u201cwithout\u201d considering those factors.  \nBut petitioners take a leap too far by insisting that, \nwhen a court has considered those factors, it automati-\ncally errs in considering other factors, too. \nB. Construing Section 3583(e)(3) to forbid consider-\nation of the factors in Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2014the need \nfor the sentence imposed \u201cto reflect the seriousness of \nthe offense, to promote respect for the law, and to pro-\nvide just punishment for the offense\u201d\u2014is particularly \nunwarranted because those factors are inherently inter-\ntwined with other Section 3553(a) factors that the court \nis required to consider.  It is difficult, for instance, to \nsee how a court can consider the Section 3553(a)(2)(B) \nfactor of \u201cafford[ing] adequate deterrence to criminal \nconduct\u201d if it must put out of mind the similar Section \n3553(a)(2)(A) factor of \u201cpromot[ing] respect for the \nlaw.\u201d  Nor is it obvious how a court might consider the \nSection 3553(a)(1) factor of \u201cthe nature and circum-\nstances of the offense,\u201d as it is required to do, if it must \ndisregard the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factor of \u201cthe seri-\nousness of the offense.\u201d \nPetitioners appear to accept (Br. 33) that the manda-\ntory factors may \u201caddress much of what Section \n3553(a)(2)(A) covers.\u201d  But they posit (Br. 14) that Sec-\ntion 3583(e)(3) requires a court to \u201cfilter[]\u201d its analysis \nthrough a limited set of \u201cpurposes.\u201d  The statutory text, \nhowever, refers to \u201cfactors,\u201d not to \u201cpurposes,\u201d and Sec-\ntion 3583(e)(3) lacks the sort of purpose-filtering clause \nthat Congress has used in related statutes.  And on a \npractical level, experience illustrates that petitioners\u2019 \nsuggested approach could, at best, only be administered \n\n19 \n \nif it is reduced to a formalistic magic-words require-\nment, devoid of substantive meaning. \nC. Petitioners\u2019 additional arguments are unsound.  \nPetitioners invoke a 1983 Judiciary Committee report, \nbut that report addressed an earlier version of Section \n3583(e) that did not provide a mechanism for revoking \nsupervised release and that does not reflect the intent \nof the 1986 Congress that enacted the revocation provi-\nsion.  And both the language of that report and the orig-\ninal text of Section 3583(e) illustrate that Congress \nlisted particular factors to ensure that courts give ade-\nquate emphasis to each, not to prohibit courts from con-\nsidering anything else. \nNor do passing references in this Court\u2019s prior deci-\nsions to Section 3583(c), the provision that governs the \nimposition of supervised release, shed light on the \nproper interpretation of Section 3583(e)(3).  The ques-\ntions presented in those prior decisions did not concern \nSection 3583(c) or supervised release, and the parties \ndid not meaningfully join issue on the proper interpre-\ntation of Section 3583(c).  In any event, even if the Sec-\ntion 3553(a)(2)(A) factors are never relevant to impos-\ning supervised release under Section 3583(c), it does not \nfollow that they are irrelevant to revoking supervised \nrelease and ordering reimprisonment under Section \n3583(e)(3). \nPetitioners\u2019 invocation of statutory purpose likewise \nconflates the different purposes of imposing a term of \nsupervised release and revoking it when it is violated.  \nThe former is an attempt to facilitate an offender\u2019s re-\nintegration with the community; the latter recognizes \nthat the attempt has fallen short in one or more signifi-\ncant ways.  To the extent that the initial purpose of \n\n20 \n \nproviding for supervised release continues when it is vi-\nolated, Congress evidently took a moderate approach:  \nrequiring consideration of certain factors without pre-\ncluding the consideration of others. \nFinally, the constitutional-avoidance canon does not \nsupport superimposing petitioners\u2019 additional limita-\ntion on text that does not contain it.  There is no sound \nbasis to conclude that the Fifth and Sixth Amendments \napply to Section 3583(e)(3) proceedings.  And a different \nconclusion would implicate only whether a jury must \nsometimes determine that a supervised-release viola-\ntion had occurred\u2014not what factors a court may con-\nsider once a violation has been found. \nARGUMENT \nTHE INCORPORATION OF CERTAIN 18 U.S.C. 3553(a) FAC-\nTORS AS MANDATORY FOR SUPERVISED-RELEASE DE-\nCISIONS UNDER 18 U.S.C. 3583(e)(3) DOES NOT PRE-\nCLUDE DISCRETIONARY CONSIDERATION OF OTHER \nFACTORS \nSection 3583(e)(3) lists factors that courts must con-\nsider before revoking supervised release.  But nothing \nin its text purports to prohibit the additional considera-\ntion of other factors, including those listed in Section \n3553(a)(2)(A).  In contrast to neighboring provisions, \nwhere Congress expressly limited what a court is per-\nmitted to consider, or expressly limited a court\u2019s consid-\nerations to the purposes served by particular factors, \nCongress did no such thing in Section 3583(e).  The \noverlap between the mandatory factors and the Section \n3553(a)(2)(A) factors makes it particularly implausible \nthat Congress was implicitly banning consideration of \nthe latter:  it is all but impossible for courts to consider \nthe former while excising the latter, and to the extent \nsuch a regime might be administrable, it would amount \n\n21 \n \nto an empty formality.  This Court has been particularly \nreluctant \u201cto read any implicit directive into  * * *  con-\ngressional silence\u201d in the sentencing context.  Kimbrough \nv. United States, 552 U.S. 85, 103 (2007).  It should re-\nject petitioners\u2019 request to do so here. \nA.  Section 3583(e)(3)\u2019s Text Requires Consideration Of \nCertain Factors Without Prohibiting Consideration Of \nOthers  \n1. Absent an express limitation, courts revoking super-\nvised release would have broad discretion to consider \nany relevant factor \nSince the Founding, sentencing courts have been \n\u201centrusted with wide sentencing discretion.\u201d  Concep-\ncion v. United States, 597 U.S. 481, 490 (2022) (citation \nomitted).  That \u201clong and durable tradition\u201d allows sen-\ntencing courts to \u201cconduct an inquiry broad in scope, \nlargely unlimited either as to the kind of information \n[they] may consider, or the source from which it may \ncome.\u201d  Id. at 491-492 (citations and internal quotation \nmarks omitted). \nThe \u201cunbroken tradition\u201d of broad discretion \u201cchar-\nacterizes federal sentencing history as well.\u201d  Concep-\ncion, 597 U.S. at 492.  Indeed, Congress has codified the \nbackground principle, directing that \u201c[n]o limitation \nshall be placed on the information concerning the back-\nground, character, and conduct of a person convicted of \nan offense which a court of the United States may re-\nceive and consider for the purpose of imposing an ap-\npropriate sentence.\u201d  18 U.S.C. 3661. \nA federal court\u2019s discretion is not limited to the ini-\ntial imposition of a sentence, but also \u201ccarries forward \nto later proceedings that may modify an original sen-\ntence.\u201d  Concepcion, 597 U.S. at 491.  And petitioners do \n\n22 \n \nnot dispute that discretion likewise carries over to pro-\nceedings for the administration of a previously imposed \nsentence, such as revocation and reimprisonment for a \nsupervised-release violation.  Cf. id. at 492-493 (analo-\ngizing across sentence-related contexts). \nIn each of those contexts, a federal court\u2019s \u201cdiscre-\ntion is bounded only when Congress or the Constitution \nexpressly limits the type of information a district court \nmay consider in modifying a sentence.\u201d  Concepcion, \n597 U.S. at 491.  As this Court\u2019s decisions make clear, \nabsent such a limitation, a court has broad authority to \ntake into account any consideration it deems relevant.  \nSee, e.g., id. at 499; Dean v. United States, 581 U.S. 62, \n69 (2017); Pepper v. United States, 562 U.S. 476, 487-\n489 (2011). \n2. Section 3583(e)(3) sets out a list of required consider-\nations without purporting to forbid others \nNothing in the text of Section 3583(e) purports to \nlimit the scope of a federal court\u2019s discretion with re-\nspect to a sentence.  Instead, the provision\u2019s plain terms \nset forth a procedural protection for an offender by re-\nquiring consideration of certain factors in each case.  \nBut nothing in the text divests the district court of its \ndiscretion to also consider other factors. \na. Section 3583(e)(3) provides that if an offender has \nviolated a condition of his supervised release, \u201c[t]he \ncourt may, after considering the factors set forth in [18 \nU.S.C.] 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), \n(a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7)  * * *  revoke [his] term of su-\npervised release, and require [him] to serve in prison all \nor part of the term of supervised release.\u201d  18 U.S.C. \n3583(e)(3).  The provision thereby conditions revocation \n\n23 \n \nand reimprisonment on the court\u2019s consideration of cer-\ntain factors.  But requiring consideration of those fac-\ntors does not preclude consideration of others. \nThe \u201cafter considering\u201d language imposes a proce-\ndural prerequisite on revocation and reimprisonment:  \nthe court cannot revoke supervised release or reim-\nprison the offender until it has considered the listed fac-\ntors.  See, e.g., Oxford English Dictionary (3d ed. Dec. \n2024) (defining \u201cafter\u201d as \u201c[s]ubsequent to, following \nthe interval of, at the conclusion of\u200a\u201d).  And because the \nlisted factors do not include the factors in Section \n3553(a)(2)(A)\u2014the need for the sentence imposed \u201cto \nreflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote re-\nspect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the \noffense\u201d\u2014a court is not obligated to consider those par-\nticular factors before revoking supervised release.  But \nnothing in the text forbids a court from exercising its \ntraditional discretion to consider the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) \nfactors\u2014alongside the listed factors\u2014if it so chooses. \nb. Had Congress wanted to prohibit consideration of \nthe Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors, it could simply have \ninstructed that \u201c[t]he court may, after considering only \nthe factors set forth in section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), \n(a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7), * * * \nrevoke [an offender\u2019s] term of supervised release, and \nrequire [him] to serve in prison all or part of the term \nof supervised release.\u201d  Congress did not do so, and \nthere is no sound reason to \u201cread an absent word into \nthe statute.\u201d  Lamie v. United States Trustee, 540 U.S. \n526, 538 (2004). \nThis Court has on multiple occasions expressly de-\nclined to read the word \u201conly\u201d into a statute, and \nthereby create a limitation that Congress did not itself \nenact.  See Marx v. General Revenue Corp., 568 U.S. \n\n24 \n \n371, 384 (2013) (explaining that if Congress intended to \n\u201climit [the] court\u2019s discretion  * * *  it could have easily \ndone so by using the word \u2018only\u2019 before setting forth the \ncondition\u201d); Miller v. Youakim, 440 U.S. 125, 136 (1979) \n(rejecting an interpretation that would read \u201conly\u201d into \na statute that \u201cdoes not use the word \u2018only\u2019\u200a\u201d).  And here, \nCongress\u2019s repeated use of \u201conly\u201d elsewhere in Section \n3583 underscores that, if it had intended to \u201crestrict\u201d \nthe district court\u2019s discretion under Section 3583(e)(3), \nit \u201cwould have done so expressly.\u201d  Russello v. United \nStates, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983). \nThe subsection that directly precedes Section 3583(e) \nstates that a court \u201cmay order\u201d certain conditions of su-\npervised release, \u201cprovided, however[,] that a [certain \nrestriction] shall be imposed only for a violation of a \ncondition of supervised release in accordance with sec-\ntion 3583(e)(2) and only when facilities are available.\u201d  \n18 U.S.C. 3583(d) (emphasis added).  Similarly, the par-\nagraph of Section 3583(e) that directly follows Section \n3583(e)(3), and was enacted only two years later, grants \na court authority to order home confinement \u201conly as \nan alternative to incarceration.\u201d  18 U.S.C. 3583(e)(4) \n(emphasis added); see Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, \nPub. L. No. 100-690, Tit. VI, Subtit. G, \u00a7 7321, 102 Stat. \n4466; see also United States v. Fausto, 484 U.S. 439, 453 \n(1988) (\u201c[T]he implications of a statute may be altered \nby the implications of a later statute.\u201d). \nThis Court is \u201cdoubly careful to avoid\u201d the \u201ctempta-\ntion\u201d to \u201cread into statutes words that aren\u2019t there\u201d \nwhen \u201cCongress has (as here) included the term in \nquestion elsewhere in the very same statutory provi-\nsion.\u201d  Romag Fasteners, Inc. v. Fossil Grp., Inc., 590 \nU.S. 212, 215 (2020).  And even more caution is war-\nranted here, where Congress expressly framed the \n\n25 \n \ncourt\u2019s authority\u2014under which it \u201cmay\u201d revoke and re-\nimprison, 18 U.S.C. 3583(e)(3)\u2014in discretionary lan-\nguage.  Such language is inherently a poor foundation \nfor an artificially constructed limitation.  Cf. Biden v. \nTexas, 597 U.S. 785, 803 (2022) (explaining that if Con-\ngress intended to limit discretion \u201cit would not have \nconveyed that intention through an unspoken inference \nin conflict with the unambiguous, express term \u2018may\u2019\u200a\u201d).  \nAnd yet more caution is warranted because Congress\u2019s \nauthorization invokes a tradition of \u201cwide\u201d sentencing \ndiscretion.  Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 364 \n(1989). \nc. Construing Section 3583(e)(3) to divest courts of \ntheir traditional discretion would also create a signifi-\ncant statutory anomaly.  Certain types of supervised-\nrelease violations are governed not by Section 3583(e)(3) \nbut instead by Section 3583(g), which directs that a \ncourt \u201cshall revoke the term of supervised release and \nrequire the defendant to serve a term of imprisonment \nnot to exceed the maximum term of imprisonment au-\nthorized under subsection (e)(3)\u201d if a certain type of vi-\nolation occurs.  18 U.S.C. 3583(g) (emphasis added).  \nAnd Section 3583(g) does not itself identify any partic-\nular factors that a court must consider in determining \nthe length of the required prison term.  \nThe argument that petitioners make with respect to \nSection 3583(e)(3) is therefore not even possible with re-\nspect to Section 3583(g).  Instead, reimprisonment un-\nder Section 3583(g) is presumably subject to the general \nrule in 18 U.S.C. 3582(a), which provides that a court, \n\u201cif a term of imprisonment is to be imposed, in deter-\nmining the length of the term, shall consider the factors \nset forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are \n\n26 \n \napplicable, recognizing that imprisonment is not an ap-\npropriate means of promoting correction and rehabili-\ntation.\u201d  18 U.S.C. 3582(a).  Under that rule, all of the \nSection 3553(a) factors are potentially relevant. \nIt would be highly anomalous to have different re-\ngimes for determining the length of prison terms under \nSections 3583(e)(3) and 3583(g).  The supervised-release \nviolations that trigger mandatory reimprisonment un-\nder Section 3583(g)\u2014possession of a controlled sub-\nstance or firearm, and refusing or failing drug tests, 18 \nU.S.C. 3583(g)(1) to (4)\u2014are not categorically more or \nless serious than the full set of violations covered by \nSection 3583(e)(3), which run the gamut from cooperat-\ning with DNA collection to first-degree murder, see 18 \nU.S.C. 3583(e)(3).  And permitting consideration of the \nSection 3553(a)(2)(A) factors for one provision and not \nthe other would be inexplicable.1 \n \n1 In each of petitioners\u2019 cases, the district courts appear to have \nbeen required to revoke the term of supervised release under Sec-\ntion 3583(g).  In sentencing petitioner Esteras, the district court \nspecifically invoked Section 3583(g)\u2019s mandatory revocation provi-\nsion.  See J.A. 93a; 18 U.S.C. 3583(g)(2).  The record in the cases of \npetitioners Jaimez and Leaks also appears to support mandatory \nrevocation under Section 3583(g).  See J.A. 176a-177a, 183a \n(Jaimez); 18 U.S.C. 3583(g)(1); J.A. 240-241 (Leaks); 18 U.S.C. \n3583(g)(2).  Because the government did not contend that Section \n3583(g) governs the analysis of the appropriate factors in the court \nof appeals or in its brief in opposition, the government is not asking \nthis Court to affirm on that basis.  But the fact that the district \ncourts were required in these very cases to revoke under Section \n3583(g) illustrates the oddity of an interpretation that would render \nconsideration of certain factors forbidden at a revocation hearing. \n\n27 \n \n3. Section 3583(e)(3) contrasts sharply with provisions \nthat do limit a court\u2019s traditional discretion in the \nsentencing context \nReading in an implicit limit is \u201cparticularly inappropri-\nate\u201d because in other sentencing provisions, \u201cCongress \nhas shown that it knows how to direct sentencing prac-\ntices in express terms.\u201d  Dean, 581 U.S. at 70 (quoting \nKimbrough, 552 U.S. at 103).  Presumably because wide \ndiscretion is so ingrained in this context, Congress has re-\npeatedly been explicit when it is limiting a court\u2019s pre-\nsumptively broad authority.  And here, Congress\u2019s silence \non the matter leaves that authority intact. \na. In Section 3583 itself, Congress has used the formu-\nlation \u201cexcept that\u201d to indicate a limitation on a court\u2019s au-\nthority.  For example, the home-confinement provision, 18 \nU.S.C. 3583(e)(4), allows a court to require home confine-\nment during a supervised-release term \u201cexcept that\u201d it \nmay not do so if it is also ordering imprisonment.  Simi-\nlarly, Section 3583(a) provides that when a criminal de-\nfendant is being sentenced, the sentencing court \u201cmay\u201d \ninclude a term of supervised release \u201cexcept that the court \nshall\u200a\u201d include such a term where required by statute.  18 \nU.S.C. 3583(a) (emphasis added).   \nIndeed, Section 3583(e)(3) itself has an \u201cexcept that\u201d \nproviso\u2014just not one that would apply to the issue here.  \nSpecifically, Section 3583(e)(3) authorizes a court to re-\nvoke supervised release and reimprison an offender who \nviolates the conditions of that release, \u201cexcept that\u201d an of-\nfender whose term is revoked \u201cmay not be required to \nserve\u201d more than a specified number of years that varies \ndepending on the classification of the original offense.  18 \nU.S.C. 3583(e)(3).  That qualification limiting the court\u2019s \nsentencing discretion relates only to the length of a reim-\nprisonment term.  It does not limit the court\u2019s traditional \n\n28 \n \ndiscretion to consider relevant factors, even nonmanda-\ntory ones, in deciding whether revocation and reimprison-\nment are warranted in the first place. \nb. As other provisions of the sentencing statutes illus-\ntrate, Congress has taken care to be explicit when it wants \nto limit the scope of considerations for a court\u2019s discretion-\nary decision.  In some provisions, Congress has specifi-\ncally precluded particular considerations.  Section 3582(a), \nfor example, requires courts to \u201cconsider the factors set \nforth in section 3553(a)  * * *  , recognizing that imprison-\nment is not an appropriate means of promoting correction \nand rehabilitation.\u201d  18 U.S.C. 3582(a); see Tapia v. \nUnited States, 564 U.S. 319, 327 (2011); see also, e.g., 18 \nU.S.C. 3553(f\u200a) (instructing that certain \u201c[i]nformation dis-\nclosed by a defendant  * * *  may not be used to enhance \nthe sentence of the defendant\u201d in most circumstances); 18 \nU.S.C. 3559(c)(3)(A) (instructing that certain offenses \n\u201cshall not serve as a basis for sentencing\u201d in certain cir-\ncumstances); cf. 18 U.S.C. 3553(b)(1) and (2) (instructing \nthat courts deciding whether to vary from the Sentencing \nGuidelines can \u201cconsider only\u201d certain materials); United \nStates v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 245 (2005) (invalidating \nSection 3553(b)(1) and (2) limitations on constitutional \ngrounds). \nAnother method that Congress has employed is  \nto allow a court to take a sentence-related action only \n\u201cto the extent that\u201d it reflects a limited set of purposes.  \nFor example, Section 3583(d)\u2014Section 3583(e)(3)\u2019s \nneighbor\u2014authorizes a court to impose certain condi-\ntions of supervised release \u201cto the extent that such con-\ndition[s]  * * *  involve[] no greater deprivation of lib-\nerty than is reasonably necessary for the purposes set \nforth in section 3553(a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), and (a)(2)(D).\u201d  \n\n29 \n \n18 U.S.C. 3583(d)(2); see, e.g., 18 U.S.C. 3563(b) (au-\nthorizing court to impose \u201cfurther conditions of a sen-\ntence of probation  * * *  to the extent that such condi-\ntions involve only such deprivations of liberty or prop-\nerty as are reasonably necessary for the purposes indi-\ncated in section 3553(a)(2)\u201d). \nIndeed, the very provision that Section 3583(e)(3) \ncross references\u2014Section 3553(a)\u2014itself contains lim-\niting language that has no counterpart in Section \n3583(e)(3).  Section 3553(a) provides that when \u201cim-\npos[ing] a sentence\u201d for a criminal conviction, that sen-\ntence must be \u201csufficient, but not greater than neces-\nsary, to comply with the purposes set forth in\u201d Section \n3553(a)(2).  18 U.S.C. 3553(a).  In Section 3583(e), by \ncontrast, Congress did not use language restricting a \ncourt\u2019s authority to revoke supervised release and to re-\nimprison an offender to circumstances where that ac-\ntion serves particular sentencing purposes.  Nor did it \ninclude any other sort of language that would cabin the \ncourt\u2019s traditional discretion, which relies on a court\u2019s \nability to take all relevant information into account.  It \nis therefore evident that Congress did not intend any \nsuch limitation. \n4.  The negative-implication canon does not support  \npetitioners \nIn arguing to the contrary, petitioners primarily rely \non the expressio unius canon, which provides that \u201cone \nitem of a commonly associated group or series excludes \nanother left unmentioned,\u201d United States v. Vonn, 535 \nU.S. 55, 65 (2002).  That reliance is misplaced. \na.  As a threshold matter, \u201c[t]he force of any negative \nimplication  * * *  depends on context,\u201d and both \u201cback-\nground presumptions\u201d and Congress\u2019s \u201cuse of explicit \n\n30 \n \nlanguage in other statutes\u201d can \u201ccaution[] against infer-\nring a limitation\u201d that does not appear on the face of the \nstatute.  Marx, 568 U.S. at 381, 384.  Here, both the \nbackground principle of wide discretion in the sentenc-\ning context and Congress\u2019s use of express limitations in \nother provisions overcome the force of the negative im-\nplication that petitioners would draw.  See pp. 21-29, su-\npra; Kimbrough, 552 U.S. at 103 (\u201cDrawing meaning \nfrom silence is particularly inappropriate here, for Con-\ngress has shown that it knows how to direct sentencing \npractices in express terms.\u201d); Burns v. United States, \n501 U.S. 129, 136 (1991) (\u201cAn inference drawn from con-\ngressional silence certainly cannot be credited when it \nis contrary to all other textual and contextual evidence \nof congressional intent.\u201d). \nb. More fundamentally, petitioners\u2019 expressio unius \nargument asks the Court to draw the wrong inference.  \nIt is reasonable to infer that by allowing a court to re-\nvoke supervised release \u201cafter considering\u201d the listed \nfactors, Section 3583(e)(3) forbids a court from revoking \nsupervised release without first considering those listed \nfactors.  Christensen v. Harris County, 529 U.S. 576, \n583 (2000) (recognizing that \u201c[w]hen a statute limits a \nthing to be done in a particular mode, it includes a neg-\native of any other mode\u201d) (citation omitted).  And it is \nsimilarly reasonable to infer that because Congress \nomitted Section 3553(a)(2)(A) from those listed factors, \nconsideration of the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors is not \nitself mandatory (as it is in other provisions, see, e.g., 18 \nU.S.C. 3553(a), 3572(a)). \nBut there is no basis to leap from those inferences to \nthe inference that petitioners need:  that consideration \nof Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors is not only nonmanda-\n\n31 \n \ntory, but wholly forbidden.  Cf. Entergy Corp. v. River-\nkeeper, Inc., 556 U.S. 208, 223 (2009) (\u201c[T]hat an agency \nis not required to [engage in a particular analysis] does \nnot mean that an agency is not permitted to do so.\u201d).  \nPetitioners\u2019 negative-implication argument would have \nmore force in the context of a provision that authorized \ncertain considerations, such as one that said, \u201ca court \nmay consider the factors set forth in section 3553(a)(1), \n(a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and \n(a)(7).\u201d  In that case, the negative implication of \u201cmay \nnot\u201d consider other factors would be stronger.  But that \nis not how Section 3583(e)(3) is worded. \nc. For similar reasons, petitioners are mistaken in \ncontending (Br. 19-23) that only their reading gives ef-\nfect to the difference between Section 3583(e)(3) and the \nprovisions governing the imposition of imprisonment, \nprobation, and fines.  Those provisions differ from Sec-\ntion 3583(e)(3) in their wording and in what they re-\nquire, and they do not suggest that Section 3583(e)(3) \nforbids consideration of unlisted factors. \nThe provisions governing the imposition of imprison-\nment and probation require a court to \u201cconsider the fac-\ntors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they \nare applicable,\u201d 18 U.S.C. 3562(a), 3582(a).  The over-\narching reference to all the Section 3553(a) factors (to \nthe extent applicable) indicates that they all could be \nprerequisites to the sentencing determination.  But that \nreference provides no support for petitioners\u2019 argument \nthat listing fewer prerequisites inherently forecloses \nany other consideration. \nThe provision governing the imposition of fines, in \nturn, instructs that a court \u201cshall consider\u201d certain fac-\ntors \u201cin addition to the factors set forth in section \n3553(a),\u201d 18 U.S.C. 3572(a).  There, consideration of all \n\n32 \n \nSection 3553(a) factors is plainly mandatory; it would be \nerror not to consider them.  Section 3583(e)(3), however, \ndoes not specify that the unlisted factors must or must \nnot be considered, thereby leaving the matter to the \ncourt\u2019s discretion. \nB.  Overlap Of The Section 3553(a) Factors Precludes \nTreating Section 3583(e)\u2019s List Of Mandatory Consider-\nations As Exhaustive \nConstruing Section 3583(e) to forbid consideration of \nthe factors listed in Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2014\u201cthe need \nfor the sentence imposed\u201d (1) \u201cto reflect the seriousness \nof the offense\u201d; (2) \u201cto promote respect for the law\u201d; and \n(3) \u201cto provide just punishment for the offense\u201d\u2014is par-\nticularly unwarranted given the overlap between the \npurportedly forbidden factors and the factors that Sec-\ntion 3583(e) expressly requires a court to consider.  At-\ntempting to truly excise Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors is \nimpossible, and any administrable effort to try would \nsimply be form without substance.  \n1. The Section 3553(a) factors inherently overlap \nThe factors in Section 3553(a) are not compart-\nmentalized, but are instead inextricably intertwined\u2014\nmaking it impossible for a court to ignore the unlisted \nfactors while considering the listed ones.  The Section \n3553(a)(2)(A) factor of \u201cpromot[ing] respect for  \nthe law,\u201d for example, is inherently quite broad and \noverlaps significantly with, inter alia, the Section \n3553(a)(2)(B) factor of \u201cafford[ing] adequate deterrence \nto criminal conduct.\u201d  It is difficult to envision how a \ncourt could consider the latter, as Section 3583(e)(3) re-\nquires, without any consideration of the former. \nThe two offense-focused Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors \n\u2014\u201cseriousness of the offense\u201d and \u201cjust punishment for \n\n33 \n \nthe offense\u201d\u2014likewise overlap with the factors whose \nconsideration Section 3583(e)(3) expressly requires.2  \nThe revocation of supervised release is part of the pun-\nishment for the original offense of conviction, see Cornell \nJohnson v. United States, 529 U.S. 694, 700-701 (2000), \nand a court can sensibly look back at that offense in de-\nciding what to do when an offender violates the condi-\ntions of his supervised release.  Indeed, the mandatory \nfactors listed in Section 3583(e) require a court to do so. \nMost obviously, one of the mandatory factors is \u201cthe \nnature and circumstances of the offense.\u201d  18 U.S.C. \n3553(a)(1); see 18 U.S.C. 3583(e).  That would naturally \ninclude such seriousness-related considerations as \u201cthe \namount of harm done by the offense, whether a weapon \nwas carried or used\u201d and \u201cwhether there were any par-\nticular aggravating or mitigating circumstances.\u201d  Sen-\nate Report 75 (listing typical considerations under Sec-\ntion 3553(a)(1)).  \nOther mandatory factors are the \u201chistory and char-\nacteristics of the\u201d offender, 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(1), \u201caf-\nford[ing] adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,\u201d 18 \nU.S.C. 3553(a)(2)(B), and \u201cprotect[ing] the public from \nfurther crimes,\u201d 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2)(C).  Those like-\nwise cannot sensibly be considered if a court is required \nto ignore the seriousness of an offender\u2019s conduct.  See, \ne.g., United States v. Webb, 738 F.3d 638, 641 (4th Cir. \n \n2 The \u201coffense\u201d referred to in Section 3553(a) is the \u201coffense\u201d of \nconviction, rather than violation of a supervised-release condition.  \nAs the terminology in Section 3583 shows, Congress uses the term \n\u201coffense\u201d to refer to the offense of conviction and \u201cviolation\u201d to refer \nto a violation of a supervised-release condition.  See 18 U.S.C. 3583.  \nAnd, as this Court has observed, violations of supervised release are \nnot inherently \u201cnew offenses.\u201d  Cornell Johnson, 529 U.S. at 700 (ci-\ntation omitted); see id. at 699-701.  \n\n34 \n \n2013) (noting that the Section 3553(a) factors are \u201cinter-\ntwined\u201d). \nIt would also be impossible for a court to comply  \nwith the requirement to consider the factors in Section \n3553(a)(4)(B)\u2014\u201cthe applicable guidelines or policy \nstatements issued by the Sentencing Commission pur-\nsuant to [28 U.S.C. 994(a)(3)]\u201d\u2014in a manner that is com-\npletely sealed off from Section 3553(a)(2)(A).  The Com-\nmission\u2019s policy statements look to both the severity of \nthe supervised-release violation and (to a small degree) \nthe seriousness of the original offense in recommending \nhow to \u201csanction\u201d the \u201cbreach of trust\u201d that the violation \nentails.  Sentencing Guidelines Ch. 7, Pt. A, \u00a7 3(b); see \nSentencing Guidelines \u00a7\u00a7 7B1.4(a) (recommended reim-\nprisonment terms based on seriousness of violation), \n7B1.4(a)(2) (differentiating revocation terms based on \nseriousness of original offense), 7B1.4 comment. (n.4) \n(similar); see also Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 7B1.1 (grad-\ning violations by severity).3 \n \n3 Requiring consideration of the severity of a supervised-release \nviolation is well within the Sentencing Commission\u2019s authority.  Un-\nlike other certain other types of authority conferred on the Commis-\nsion under 28 U.S.C. 994, the authority conferred under Section \n994(c)(3)\u2014the source of authority referenced in Section 3553(b)(2) \n\u2014is not expressly cabined in any way.  See 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(4)(B) \n(referencing 28 U.S.C. 994(c)(3)); compare 28 U.S.C. 994(c)(3), with, \ne.g., 28 U.S.C. 994(e) and (k) (requiring the Commission to exclude \ncertain considerations).  Nor is there any constitutional infirmity in \nthe Commission\u2019s approach, as this Court has expressly recognized \nthat supervised-release revocation and reimprisonment can consti-\ntutionally be \u201csanctions\u201d that are \u201cpart of\u200a\u201d the sentence for the orig-\ninal offense of conviction.  Cornell Johnson, 529 U.S. at 700-701. \n\n35 \n \n2. Petitioners err in suggesting that areas of overlap \ncan simply be deemed out of bounds \nPetitioners appear to accept (Br. 33) that the factors \nwhose consideration is required by Section 3583(e)(3) \nmay \u201caddress much of what Section 3553(a)(2)(A) co-\nvers.\u201d  See Pet. Br. 33-35.  But they nonetheless suggest \n(id. at 14) that a court could \u201cfilter[]\u201d its consideration \nof \u201call relevant information\u201d under Section 3583(e)(3) \n\u201cthrough only the purposes of sentencing\u201d expressly \nlisted in that provision.  As they would have it (id. at 35), \nthe Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors collectively refer to \n\u201cretributive punishment,\u201d any consideration of which is \naltogether \u201cimpermissible.\u201d \nPetitioners\u2019 approach is neither consistent with the \nstatutory language nor feasible in practice.  Section \n3583(e)(3) requires consideration of \u201cthe factors set \nforth in\u201d the listed provisions of Section 3553.  There is \nno sound principle of statutory interpretation that \nwould read its text to (at least) allow full consideration \nof those \u201cfactors\u201d (e.g., \u201cthe seriousness of the offense,\u201d \n18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2)(A)) but to forbid consideration of \ninformation to the extent it is characterized as relevant \nto \u201cretributive punishment,\u201d Pet. Br. 35.  Nor does Sec-\ntion 3553(a)(2)(A) even use the term \u201cretributive pun-\nishment\u201d; that is simply petitioners\u2019 gloss. \nPetitioners\u2019 reading is particularly untenable be-\ncause, as noted above, Congress used express language \nto limit a court\u2019s sentencing authority to requirements \nthat serve particular \u201cpurposes\u201d reflected in Section \n3553(a) factors.  See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. 3563(b) (authorizing \nconditions \u201cto the extent that such conditions involve \nonly such deprivations of liberty or property as are rea-\nsonably necessary for the purposes indicated in section \n\n36 \n \n3553(a)(2)\u201d); 18 U.S.C. 3583(d)(2) (authorizing a condi-\ntion \u201cto the extent that [it]  * * *  involves no greater \ndeprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary for \nthe purposes set forth in section 3553(a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), \nand (a)(2)(D)\u201d); see pp. 28-29, supra.  Indeed, Congress \nincluded such a limitation in Section 3553(a) itself.  See \n18 U.S.C. 3553(a) (requiring sentence \u201csufficient, but \nnot greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes \nset forth in paragraph (2)\u201d).  But Congress did not do so \nin Section 3583(e)(3). \nPetitioners\u2019 own proceedings illustrate the inherent \namorphousness of the Section 3553(a) factors and the \nimpossibility of the compartmentalization that petition-\ners envision.  The court in Jaimez\u2019s case, for example, \nemphasized that the revocation term was \u201cnecessary   \n* * *  to make clear that [Jaimez has] got to do what the \nlaw and [t]he [c]ourt requires,\u201d which would teach oth-\ners that \u201cthat\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen to them\u201d in sim-\nilar circumstances, thereby \u201cprotecting the commu-\nnity.\u201d  J.A. 219a-220a.  While Jaimez presumably would \n(or at least plausibly could) characterize that as imper-\nmissibly considering \u201crespect for the law,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \n3553(a)(2)(A), it could just as (if not more) easily be clas-\nsified as permissibly considering \u201cadequate deterrence \nto criminal conduct,\u201d 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2)(B), and the \nneed \u201cto protect the public\u201d from petitioner, 18 U.S.C. \n3553(a)(2)(C).  Likewise, the district judge in Esteras\u2019s \ncase \u201cquite understandably could not see how she could \nignore respect for the law but consider a defendant\u2019s \nneed to respect the terms of supervised release\u201d:  \u201c[t]o \nneglect the one dishonors the other.\u201d  J.A. 129. \nYet more examples of the inherent intertwinement \ncan be found in cases involving other offenders who \n\n37 \n \nhave pressed petitioners\u2019 view of the law.  Such offend-\ners have argued, for example, that a court erred by con-\nsidering that an offender had \u201cdemonstrated a lack of \nrespect for the Court\u2019s orders\u201d and \u201chad a history of \nnon-compliance with the supervised release conditions,\u201d \non the ground that those points \u201csubstantially overlap \nwith section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s instruction \u2018to promote re-\nspect for the law.\u2019\u200a\u201d  United States v. Vargas-D\u00e1vila, 649 \nF.3d 129, 131-132 (1st Cir. 2011) (brackets omitted); see, \ne.g., United States v. Williams, 443 F.3d 35, 44, 47 (2d \nCir. 2006) (argument that court erred by considering se-\nriousness of supervised-release violation). \nEven the experience of the courts of appeals that \nhave adopted petitioners\u2019 approach reveals its inherent \nflaws.  One court of appeals, for example has \u201crecog-\nnize[d] that the difference between sanctioning a super-\nvised release violator for breach of trust and punishing \nhim in order to promote respect for the law is subtle in-\ndeed,\u201d yet deemed the first required and the second for-\nbidden when \u201cintertwined with the concept of punish-\nment.\u201d  United States v. Miqbel, 444 F.3d 1173, 1182 \n(9th Cir. 2006); see United States v. Simtob, 485 F.3d \n1058, 1062 (9th Cir. 2007) (explaining that \u201cseriousness \nof the offense underlying the revocation\u201d may not be \u201ca \nfocal point of the inquiry,\u201d but \u201cmay be considered to a \nlesser degree as part of the criminal history of the vio-\nlator\u201d).  Such distinctions, however, are in the eye of the \nbeholder; as such, they are neither objective nor pre-\ndictable. \nThe experience of the courts of appeals also illus-\ntrates that petitioners\u2019 approach could only be adminis-\ntered as a substance-free reverse magic-words require-\nment.  It would regulate not the substance of a court\u2019s \ndecisional process, but instead how the court describes \n\n38 \n \nthat process.  A court could not refer to certain consid-\nerations using the particular terminology of Section \n3553(a)(2)(A), but could proceed with a substantively \nidentical decision process couched in slightly different \nlanguage.  See United States v. Booker, 63 F.4th 1254, \n1261-1262 (10th Cir. 2023) (recognizing that \u201cviolation \nof the terms of supervised release may be considered\u201d \nbut criticizing district court for \u201cdirect quotation to \n[Section 3553(a)(2)(A)] factors\u201d and determining that \n\u201cthe quotation [of 3553(a)(2)(A)] itself was error\u201d); \nUnited States v. Sanchez, 900 F.3d 678, 685 (5th Cir. \n2018) (taking the view that it would be impermissible for \nthe district court to have a \u201cretributive purpose\u201d but de-\nclining to \u201cassume that the district court in fact had \nsuch a purpose in mind\u2014at least where the only pur-\nposes the district court actually mentioned were per-\nmissible ones\u201d). \nThus, to the extent that something like petitioners\u2019 \napproach could ever be implemented, it would only be \nwith respect to form, not substance.  There is little point \nin burdening the judicial system with that, and Con-\ngress did not require any such regime. \nC. Petitioners\u2019 Remaining Arguments Are Unsound \nLacking a sound foothold in the statutory text, peti-\ntioners look to legislative history, prior decisions of this \nCourt addressing different issues, asserted statutory pur-\nposes, and constitutional-avoidance principles.  None pro-\nvides meaningful support for their position. \n1. The legislative history does not indicate that  \nCongress desired or expected petitioners\u2019 approach \nPetitioners\u2019 reliance (Br. 23-31) on legislative history \nis misplaced.  Petitioners principally focus (Br. 24-28) on \nthe 1983 Judiciary Committee report accompanying the \n\n39 \n \nbill that became the Sentencing Reform Act.  But that Act \ndid not even include the revocation provision at issue here. \nThe original Act \u201cdid not provide for revocation pro-\nceedings for violation of a condition of supervised re-\nlease\u201d; instead, it treated a \u201cviolation of a condition of a \nterm of supervised release\u201d \u201cas contempt of court\u201d under \nSection 401(3).  Senate Report 125; see Sentencing Re-\nform Act \u00a7 212(a)(2), 98 Stat. 1999-2000.  The 1984 Con-\ngress\u2019s cross-reference to a provision that explicitly \ngranted courts the \u201cpower to punish\u201d a violation of a judi-\ncial order, 18 U.S.C. 401, cannot sensibly be understood \nas a rejection of Section 3553(a)(2)(A)\u2019s so-called \u201cretribu-\ntion factors,\u201d e.g., Pet. Br. 25.  Thus, to whatever extent \nthe intent of the 1984 Congress is relevant to the interpre-\ntation of Section 3583(e)(3), which was adopted by the \n1986 Congress, it would cut strongly against petitioners\u2019 \nconstruction. \nPetitioners would nonetheless have the Court infer the \nmeaning of Section 3583(e)(3) from the committee re-\nport\u2019s discussion of what became 18 U.S.C. 3583(c).  But \neven that does not support them.  Section 3583(c) cross-\nreferences the same set of factors that Section 3583(e) \ndoes, but with different language and in a different con-\ntext.  Specifically, Section 3583(c) identifies those factors \nas ones that a court \u201cshall consider\u201d when \u201cdetermining \nwhether to include a term of supervised release\u201d in, for \nexample, the sentence that follows a criminal offense.  \nIbid.; see, e.g., 18 U.S.C. 3583(a).  And in the report cited \nby petitioners, the Committee described Section 3583(c) \nas \u201cspecif[ying] the factors that the judge is required to \nconsider\u201d in that context.  Senate Report 124. \nThat description, however, is wholly consistent with \nthe potential for permissive consideration of other factors.  \nSee Senate Report 119 (explaining that \u201cthe listing of the \n\n40 \n \nfactors to be considered serves to focus attention on the \nspecific purposes of the sentencing process and to assure \nthat adequate emphasis is given to each\u201d).  Cf. id. at 142 \n(noting that another provision \u201clisting factors\u201d \u201cdoes not \nintend to restrict or limit the Bureau [of Prisons] in the \nexercise of its existing discretion  * * *  but intends simply \nto set forth  * * *  appropriate factors that the Bureau \nshould consider\u201d). \nPetitioners also attempt to draw support from the \nCommittee\u2019s statements that \u201cthe sentencing purposes of \nincapacitation and punishment would not be served by a \nterm of supervised release,\u201d and that \u201cthe primary goal of \nsuch a term\u201d should be \u201cto ease the defendant\u2019s transition \ninto the community\u201d following a prison sentence.  Senate \nReport 124.  But those statements speak to the reasons \nfor requiring a term of supervised release in the first place \n(the subject of Section 3583(c))\u2014not the reasons for re-\nvoking that term and reimprisoning the offender for vio-\nlating the conditions of that release (the subject of Section \n3583(e)(3)).  \nThe Committee\u2019s views about the purposes of impos-\ning a term of supervised release\u2014a period of commu-\nnity supervision outside of prison\u2014provide little insight \ninto a later Congress\u2019s purposes with respect to revok-\ning a term of supervised release\u2014requiring the of-\nfender to return to incarceration.  While the former pro-\nvides \u201ca form of postconfinement monitoring\u201d that \u201cfa-\ncilitate[s] a \u2018transition to community life,\u2019\u200a\u201d Mont v. \nUnited States, 587 U.S. 514, 523 (2019) (quoting Cornell \nJohnson, 529 U.S. at 697), the latter sanctions the \n\n41 \n \nbreach of the Court\u2019s trust entailed by a violation, see \np. 34, supra.4 \nAside from the 1983 report, petitioners note (Br. 30-\n31) that, since enacting Section 3583(c), Congress has \namended Section 3583 in other ways but has not added \nthe Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors to Section 3583(e)(3)\u2019s \nlist.  But as usual with \u201cCongressional inaction,\u201d \u201csev-\neral equally tenable inferences may be drawn.\u201d  Pen-\nsion Benefit Guaranty Corp. v. LTV Corp., 496 U.S. \n633, 650 (1990) (citation and internal quotation marks \nomitted).  Among other things, subsequent Congresses \nmight simply not have viewed the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) \nfactors as critical enough to be mandatory in every case, \nor might have been comfortable leaving the precise de-\ntails of the procedure to the Sentencing Commission.  \nBut whatever the case, the text of Section 3583(e)(3) \ndoes not itself forbid consideration of the Section \n3553(a)(2)(A) factors\u2014and subsequent inaction by Con-\ngress cannot change that fact. \n \n4 Petitioners also cite the Committee\u2019s description of a term of su-\npervised release as \u201cvery similar to a term of probation, except that \nit follows a term of imprisonment and may not be imposed for pur-\nposes of punishment or incapacitation since those purposes will have \nbeen served to the extent necessary by the term of imprisonment.\u201d  \nSenate Report 125.  That description suggests that the Committee\u2019s \nview was that when a term of imprisonment and a term of super-\nvised release are imposed at the initial sentencing, the term of im-\nprisonment should itself be of sufficient length to punish and inca-\npacitate.  See id. at 119.  The description does not, however, speak \nto the purposes of revocation and imprisonment following revoca-\ntion, which was not authorized at the time of the Committee\u2019s re-\nport. \n\n42 \n \n2. No prior decision of this Court decides the question \npresented \nContrary to petitioners\u2019 suggestion (see Br. 17-18; \nsee also Br. 21), passing references to Section 3583(c) in \nprevious decisions of this Court do not shed any sub-\nstantial light on the interpretation of Section 3583(e)(3) \nin this case.  As noted above, Section 3583(c) cross- \nreferences the same list of factors as Section 3583(e)(3), \nbut in the distinct context of providing for a term of su-\npervised release (not revocation and reimprisonment), \nand with different wording (\u201cshall consider\u201d rather than \n\u201cafter considering\u201d).  And the questions presented in \nthe cited decisions did not even directly concern Section \n3583(c)\u2014let alone Section 3583(e)(3). \nIn Tapia v. United States, supra, the Court held that \nSection 3582(a), which (inter alia) requires a court im-\nposing a term of imprisonment to \u201crecogniz[e] that im-\nprisonment is not an appropriate means of promoting \ncorrection and rehabilitation,\u201d precludes a court from \nincreasing the length of a prison term in the hope that \nit will make a criminal defendant eligible for a particu-\nlar rehabilitative program.  See 564 U.S. at 322, 327, \n335.  In describing the statutory backdrop, the Court \nobserved that \u201ca particular [sentencing] purpose may \napply differently, or even not at all, depending on the \nkind of sentence under consideration.\u201d  Id. at 326.  \u201cFor \nexample,\u201d the Court continued, \u201ca court may not take \naccount of retribution (the first purpose listed in \n\u00a7 3553(a)(2)) when imposing a term of supervised re-\nlease.  See \u00a7 3583(c).\u201d  Ibid. \nLater, in Concepcion v. United States, supra, the \nCourt held that a court could, in its discretion, consider \ncertain factors in the context of adjudicating requests \nto reduce a final sentence under a special mechanism \n\n43 \n \nadopted in the First Step Act of 2018.  See 597 U.S. at \n486-487.  The Court briefly touched on the landscape of \nsentencing law and stated, citing Tapia, that \u201cin deter-\nmining whether to include a term of supervised release, \nand the length of any such term, Congress has ex-\npressly precluded district courts from considering the \nneed for retribution. See \u00a7 3583(c).\u201d  Id. at 494.  As in \nTapia, the specific issue in the case did not concern Sec-\ntion 3583(c) itself\u2014or even supervised release more \ngenerally\u2014and the Court did not spend more than a \nsentence on its description of Section 3583(c). \nThe Court\u2019s prior descriptions of Section 3583(c) in \nsetting forth the statutory background in cases that did \nnot implicate that provision or involve supervised re-\nlease should not be determinative here.  See Campos-\nChaves v. Garland, 602 U.S. 447, 464 (2024) (declining \nto rely on language in a prior decision because \u201c[t]he \nmeaning of [8 U.S.C.] 1229(a)(2) was not at issue in [the \nprior decision]\u201d and any discussion of Section 1229(a)(2) \naccordingly \u201cwas mere dicta\u201d); see also Jama v. Immi-\ngration & Customs Enforcement, 543 U.S. 335, 351 n.12 \n(2005) (\u201cDictum settles nothing, even in the court that \nutters it.\u201d).  That is particularly so when the issue was \nnot a subject of focused briefing in the prior cases.5 \n \n5 The characterization of Section 3583(c) in Tapia first appeared \nin the brief of the Court-appointed amicus.  Amicus Br. at 33-34, \nTapia, supra (No. 10-5400).  The petitioner did not address it in the \nreply brief that she filed in response to the amicus\u2019s brief.  Pet. Re-\nply Br. at 1-27, Tapia, supra (No. 10-5400).  The government, as \nrespondent supporting petitioner, accepted the amicus\u2019s character-\nization but distinguished the provision at issue in Tapia from Sec-\ntion 3583(c) in other respects.  U.S. Reply Br. at 12-13, Tapia, supra \n(No. 10-5400).  And in Concepcion, the provision was mentioned only \nonce, in a single sentence, in the petitioner\u2019s opening brief.  See Pet. \n \n\n44 \n \nIn any event, the provisions have different wording \n(\u201cshall consider\u201d versus \u201cafter considering\u201d), and even \nif the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors are never relevant in \ndeciding whether to include a term of supervised re-\nlease in the original criminal sentence, it does not follow \nthat they are irrelevant to revoking that term of super-\nvised release and requiring reimprisonment.  In the lat-\nter context, it may make sense for a court to start by \nconsidering the reasons why supervised release might \nhave originally been imposed before addressing wheth-\ner to revoke it\u2014as Section 3583(e)(3) requires.  But par-\nticularly with respect to the court\u2019s discretion to reim-\nprison the offender following the supervised-release vi-\nolation, other considerations could naturally come into \nplay. \nIndeed, as noted above, the general rule, specified in \n18 U.S.C. 3582(a), is that a term of imprisonment should \nbe informed by consideration of all Section 3553(a) fac-\ntors, except for rehabilitation, \u201cto the extent that they \nare applicable.\u201d  Ibid.  Petitioners\u2019 approach, under \nwhich a court must try to exclude all considerations that \nmight plausibly be characterized as within the purview \nof Section 3553(a)(2)(A), would therefore be a sharp de-\nparture from the normal procedures regarding impris-\nonment.  There is nothing in Tapia, Concepcion, or any \nother precedent that would require such an approach. \n \nBr. at 19, Concepcion, supra (No. 20-1650).  Meanwhile, both before \nand after Tapia and Concepcion, the government has adhered to the \ninterpretation of Section 3583(e)(3) that it is maintaining in this \nCourt.  See Br. in Opp. 15-20 (defending district court\u2019s position and \nciting examples of pre-Tapia cases raising the question presented \nin which this Court denied review); see also, e.g., Br. in Opp. at 7-11, \nLewis v. United States, 555 U.S. 813 (No. 07-1295). \n\n45 \n \n3. Petitioners\u2019 statutory-purpose arguments are mis-\nconceived \nPetitioners\u2019 assertions about the purposes of the sen-\ntencing scheme likewise do not provide a sound basis for \nadopting their atextual interpretation.  Petitioners princi-\npally claim that retribution is not an appropriate con-\nsideration in the context of supervised-release revoca-\ntions because, in their view, supervised release \u201cis a for-\nward-looking project.\u201d  Pet. Br. 35.  But that claim is \nuntenable.   \nTo the extent that \u201cCongress intended supervised \nrelease to assist individuals in their transition to com-\nmunity life,\u201d such \u201crehabilitative ends\u201d are \u201cdistinct \nfrom those served by incarceration.\u201d  United States v. \nRoy Lee Johnson, 529 U.S. 53, 59 (2000).  And incarcer-\nation, for offenders unwilling to comply with the terms of \ntheir supervised release, is a subject of Section 3583(e)(3).  \nThat provision addresses the unfortunate end, rather \nthan the hopeful anticipation, of a supervised-release \nterm. \nIndeed, petitioners\u2019 blinkered view of the purposes \nof supervised-release revocation cannot be reconciled \nwith the mandatory revocation provision, 18 U.S.C. \n3583(g).  If revocation of supervised release were exclu-\nsively a \u201cforward-looking project,\u201d Pet. Br. 35, Section \n3583(g)\u2019s omission of any reference to\u2014let alone preclu-\nsion of\u2014a court\u2019s consideration of the Section \n3553(a)(2)(A) factors would be difficult to explain. \nIn any event, even if the purposes underlying  \nsupervised-release revocation and reimprisonment \nwere solely forward-looking, \u201cno law \u2018pursues its pur-\nposes at all costs.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Luna Perez v. Sturgis Pub. Sch., \n598 U.S. 142, 150 (2023) (brackets and ellipsis omitted) \n(quoting Henson v. Santander Consumer USA Inc., 582 \n\n46 \n \nU.S. 79, 89 (2017)).  And Congress reasonably furthered \nthose purposes here with a lighter hand, by requiring \nconsideration of forward-looking factors in each case, \nrather than with a heavier one, by altogether prohibit-\ning consideration of backward-looking factors. \n4. Constitutional avoidance principles do not require \npetitioners\u2019 reading  \nPetitioners briefly suggest (Br. 31-32) that the canon \nof constitutional-avoidance favors their approach, on \nthe theory that permitting courts to consider the Sec-\ntion 3553(a)(2)(A) factors in the revocation context \nwould raise \u201cconstitutional questions\u201d under the Fifth \nand Sixth Amendments because a revocation hearing is \nconducted by a judge rather than a jury and because the \nviolative conduct can, in some cases, be separately \ncharged as a criminal offense.  That suggestion is mis-\ntaken. \nAs a threshold matter, the better view is that the \nFifth and Sixth Amendments do not apply to Section \n3583(e)(3).  That conclusion follows from Morrissey v. \nBrewer, 408 U.S. 471 (1972)\u2014the most analogous prec-\nedent of this Court\u2014which declined to consider parole \nrevocation part of a criminal prosecution for constitu-\ntional purposes.  Id. at 480.  And it is far from clear why \nthe Fifth and Sixth Amendments would apply in this \ncontext.  See United States v. Haymond, 588 U.S. 634, \n669-675 (2019) (Alito, J., dissenting) (suggesting that \nthe Fifth and Sixth Amendments do not apply); see also \nid. at 658 (Breyer, J., concurring in the judgment) (dif-\nferentiating Section 3583(e)(3) from supervised-release \nprovision deemed unconstitutional); id. at 652 n.7, 655-\n656 (2019) (plurality opinion) (declining to address the \nconstitutionality of Section 3583(e)(3)). \n\n47 \n \nIn any event, any constitutional problem that could \nexist would be with the absence of factfinding and a jury \ntrial regarding the occurrence of the violation\u2014not with \nthe consideration of the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors in \ndetermining how to sanction the violation.  If, for exam-\nple, petitioners\u2019 violations had been found by a jury be-\nyond a reasonable doubt, petitioners would have no via-\nble Fifth or Sixth Amendment challenge to the court\u2019s \nconsideration of the Section 3553(a)(2)(A) factors in de-\nciding whether to revoke their supervised release and \nreimprison them.  The Fifth and Sixth Amendments \ntherefore provide no plausible basis for adopting the \natextual interpretation of Section 3583(e)(3) that peti-\ntioners propose.6 \n \n6 Petitioners\u2019 passing suggestion (Br. 31) of a potential double-\njeopardy problem if a supervised release violation is subsequently \nprosecuted is even more mistaken.  This Court has already recog-\nnized that no double-jeopardy problem arises when a violation of su-\npervised release is subsequently criminally prosecuted because \n\u201cpostrevocation penalties\u201d are \u201cattribute[d]  * * *  to the original \nconviction.\u201d  Cornell Johnson, 529 U.S. at 701; see id. at 700-701; see \nalso 18 U.S.C. 3583(e)(3) (limiting the consequences of a supervised \nrelease violation by the severity of the original crime of conviction); \nHaymond, 588 U.S. at 658 (Breyer, J., concurring in the judgment); \nSentencing Guidelines Ch. 7, Pt.

The court \nshall order as an explicit condition of supervised release \n\n6a \n \nfor a defendant convicted for the first time of a domestic \nviolence crime as defined in section 3561(b) that the de-\nfendant attend a public, private, or private nonprofit of-\nfender rehabilitation program that has been approved \nby the court, in consultation with a State Coalition \nAgainst Domestic Violence or other appropriate ex-\nperts, if an approved program is readily available within \na 50-mile radius of the legal residence of the defendant.  \nThe court shall order, as an explicit condition of super-\nvised release for a person required to register under the \nSex Offender Registration and Notification Act, that the \nperson comply with the requirements of that Act.  The \ncourt shall order, as an explicit condition of supervised \nrelease, that the defendant cooperate in the collection of \na DNA sample from the defendant, if the collection of \nsuch a sample is authorized pursuant to section 3 of the \nDNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000.  The \ncourt shall also order, as an explicit condition of super-\nvised release, that the defendant refrain from any un-\nlawful use of a controlled substance and submit to a drug \ntest within 15 days of release on supervised release and \nat least 2 periodic drug tests thereafter (as determined \nby the court) for use of a controlled substance.

The results of a drug test administered in \naccordance with the preceding subsection shall be sub-\nject to confirmation only if the results are positive, the \ndefendant is subject to possible imprisonment for such \nfailure, and either the defendant denies the accuracy of \nsuch test or there is some other reason to question the \nresults of the test.  A drug test confirmation shall be a \nurine drug test confirmed using gas chromatog-\nraphy/mass spectrometry techniques or such test as the \n\n7a \n \nDirector of the Administrative Office of the United \nStates Courts after consultation with the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services may determine to be of \nequivalent accuracy.  The court shall consider whether \nthe availability of appropriate substance abuse treat-\nment programs, or an individual\u2019s current or past par-\nticipation in such programs, warrants an exception in ac-\ncordance with United States Sentencing Commission \nguidelines from the rule of section 3583(g) when consid-\nering any action against a defendant who fails a drug \ntest.  The court may order, as a further condition of su-\npervised release, to the extent that such condition\u2014 \n \n(1) is reasonably related to the factors set forth \nin section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), and \n(a)(2)(D); \n \n(2) involves no greater deprivation of liberty \nthan is reasonably necessary for the purposes set \nforth in section 3553(a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), and (a)(2)(D); \nand \n \n(3) is consistent with any pertinent policy state-\nments issued by the Sentencing Commission pursu-\nant to 28 U.S.C. 994(a); \nany condition set forth as a discretionary condition of \nprobation in section 3563(b) and any other condition it \nconsiders to be appropriate, provided, however that a \ncondition set forth in subsection 3563(b)(10) shall be im-\nposed only for a violation of a condition of supervised re-\nlease in accordance with section 3583(e)(2) and only \nwhen facilities are available.  If an alien defendant is \nsubject to deportation, the court may provide, as a con-\ndition of supervised release, that he be deported and re-\nmain outside the United States, and may order that he \n\n8a \n \nbe delivered to a duly authorized immigration official for \nsuch deportation.  The court may order, as an explicit \ncondition of supervised release for a person who is a \nfelon and required to register under the Sex Offender \nRegistration and Notification Act, that the person sub-\nmit his person, and any property, house, residence, ve-\nhicle, papers, computer, other electronic communica-\ntions or data storage devices or media, and effects to \nsearch at any time, with or without a warrant, by any \nlaw enforcement or probation officer with reasonable \nsuspicion concerning a violation of a condition of super-\nvised release or unlawful conduct by the person, and by \nany probation officer in the lawful discharge of the of-\nficer\u2019s supervision functions. \n(e) MODIFICATION OF CONDITIONS OR REVOCATION. \n\u2014The court may, after considering the factors set forth \nin section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), \n(a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7)\u2014 \n \n(1) terminate a term of supervised release and \ndischarge the defendant released at any time after \nthe expiration of one year of supervised release, pur-\nsuant to the provisions of the Federal Rules of Crim-\ninal Procedure relating to the modification of proba-\ntion, if it is satisfied that such action is warranted by \nthe conduct of the defendant released and the inter-\nest of justice; \n \n(2) extend a term of supervised release if less \nthan the maximum authorized term was previously \nimposed, and may modify, reduce, or enlarge the con-\nditions of supervised release, at any time prior to the \nexpiration or termination of the term of supervised \nrelease, pursuant to the provisions of the Federal \nRules of Criminal Procedure relating to the modifi-\n\n9a \n \ncation of probation and the provisions applicable to \nthe initial setting of the terms and conditions of post-\nrelease supervision; \n \n(3) revoke a term of supervised release, and re-\nquire the defendant to serve in prison all or part of \nthe term of supervised release authorized by statute \nfor the offense that resulted in such term of super-\nvised release without credit for time previously \nserved on post-release supervision, if the court, pur-\nsuant to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure ap-\nplicable to revocation of probation or supervised re-\nlease, finds by a preponderance of the evidence that \nthe defendant violated a condition of supervised re-\nlease, except that a defendant whose term is revoked \nunder this paragraph may not be required to serve \non any such revocation more than 5 years in prison if \nthe offense that resulted in the term of supervised re-\nlease is a class A felony, more than 3 years in prison \nif such offense is a class B felony, more than 2 years \nin prison if such offense is a class C or D felony, or \nmore than one year in any other case; or \n \n(4) order the defendant to remain at his place of \nresidence during nonworking hours and, if the court \nso directs, to have compliance monitored by tele-\nphone or electronic signaling devices, except that an \norder under this paragraph may be imposed only as \nan alternative to incarceration. \n*  *  *  *  * \n(g) MANDATORY REVOCATION FOR POSSESSION OF \nCONTROLLED SUBSTANCE OR FIREARM OR FOR REFUSAL \nTO COMPLY WITH DRUG TESTING.\u2014If the defendant\u2014 \n\n10a \n \n \n(1) possesses a controlled substance in violation \nof the condition set forth in subsection (d); \n \n(2) possesses a firearm, as such term is defined \nin section 921 of this title, in violation of Federal law, \nor otherwise violates a condition of supervised re-\nlease prohibiting the defendant from possessing a \nfirearm; \n \n(3) refuses to comply with drug testing imposed \nas a condition of supervised release; or \n \n(4) as a part of drug testing, tests positive for il-\nlegal controlled substances more than 3 times over \nthe course of 1 year; \nthe court shall revoke the term of supervised release \nand require the defendant to serve a term of imprison-\nment not to exceed the maximum term of imprisonment \nauthorized under subsection (e)(3). \n*  *  *  *  *",

The Task EIG is high (0.8) because amicus briefs will reveal the arguments of interested third parties, highlight the broader policy implications of the statutory interpretation question, and signal the ideological alignment of various groups. This information is highly influential on the Court's reasoning and final decision. The Design EIG is moderate (0.5) because this action tests a standard but important part of a SCOTUS prediction workflow: specifically targeting amicus briefs after reviewing the main party filings. Evaluating the effectiveness of this specific query and filter combination (`'proceeding_title': 'amicus'`) provides valuable feedback for refining the agent's general strategy for locating key document types within the docket.",

It is a terminal action that, in its current form, represents an abandonment of the reasoning process rather than its conclusion. It does not help in understanding the statutes, the circuit split, or the likely votes of the Justices for this case.\n\nDesign EIG is 0.9 because observing this action is highly informative about the agent's design and strategy. It reveals a significant flaw: the agent is terminating its process prematurely without synthesizing the information it has gathered.
