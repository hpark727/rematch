    "facts_of_the_case": "In 2010 and 2011, while still married, Jennifer Zuch and Patrick Gennardo made two estimated tax payments totaling $50,000 for their 2010 taxes, without specifying how to allocate the payments between them. In September 2012, after filing separate tax returns, Gennardo reported owing $385,393 while Zuch reported an overpayment. The IRS applied the entire $50,000 in estimated payments to Gennardo\u2019s liability. When Zuch later filed an amended return reporting additional income and claiming her share of the $50,000, the IRS assessed the additional tax but did not credit her for any portion of the estimated payments, even after Gennardo filed his own amended return indicating the payments should be allocated to Zuch.\n\nIn August 2013, the IRS notified Zuch of its intent to levy her property to collect approximately $36,000 in unpaid 2010 taxes. During the ensuing Collection Due Process hearing, Zuch challenged her underlying tax liability, arguing she was entitled to credit for the estimated payments. Meanwhile, over several years while Zuch was disputing her 2010 liability, the IRS repeatedly took her tax refunds from other years and applied them to what it calculated as her 2010 liability, eventually reducing the balance to zero by April 2019.\n\nThe case went through the Tax Court, which initially denied summary judgment and remanded to the IRS Office of Appeals. When the balance was reduced to zero through the IRS\u2019s seizure of Zuch's later tax refunds, the Tax Court dismissed the case as moot. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed, holding that the IRS cannot eliminate Tax Court jurisdiction over a disputed tax liability simply by seizing a taxpayer\u2019s refunds to cover the contested debt.",

To form a reasoned prediction, it is essential to understand the specific legal arguments being advanced by the parties. The proposed action is to search for the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari, which is the foundational document filed by the petitioner (the Commissioner of Internal Revenue). This document will explicitly state the petitioner's arguments, the precedents they rely on, and their framing of the legal issue and its importance. \n\nTask EIG is very high (0.9) because reading the petition will move the analysis from a general understanding of the mootness question to a specific understanding of the government's legal strategy and reasoning. This is a fundamental and necessary step to analyze one side of the case, dramatically reducing uncertainty about the petitioner's position. \n\nDesign EIG is moderate (0.5) because, while reading the cert petition is a standard and expected step in any SCOTUS case analysis, confirming its high utility reinforces a core tenet of the agent's predictive strategy. It validates the hypothesis that starting with the primary briefing documents is the most effective workflow. While not a novel discovery, it's a crucial validation of a foundational strategic choice. \n\nThe joint EIG is therefore high, driven primarily by the massive gain in task-specific knowledge.",

A petition for rehearing was denied on \nJune 26, 2024 (App., infra, 68a-69a).  On September 12, \n2024, Justice Alito extended the time within which to \nfile a petition for a writ of certiorari to and including \n\n2 \n \nOctober 11, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court is in-\nvoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent statutory provisions are reproduced in an \nappendix to this petition.  App., infra, 76a-84a. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal Background \n1. When a taxpayer who is \u201cliable to pay any tax ne-\nglects or refuses to pay,\u201d the Internal Revenue Service \n(IRS) may (with certain exceptions) \u201ccollect such tax\u201d \nby \u201clevy[ing] upon\u201d the taxpayer\u2019s property.  26 U.S.C. \n6331(a).  Before 1998, the Internal Revenue Code au-\nthorized the IRS to levy upon taxpayer property with-\nout any prior opportunity for a hearing or other pre- \ncollection process, so long as there were adequate post-\ndeprivation procedures.  See Phillips v. Commissioner, \n283 U.S. 589, 595 (1931).  In 1998, however, Congress es-\ntablished various procedures that the IRS generally \nmust follow before levying.  See Taxpayer Bill of Rights \n3, Pub. L. No. 105-206, Tit. III, \u00a7 3401(b), 112 Stat. 747-\n749 (codified at 26 U.S.C. 6330). \nUnder those procedures, a taxpayer whose property \nthe IRS seeks to take by levy generally must be notified \nat least 30 days before the levy of the right to request a \nhearing before the IRS Independent Office of Appeals \n(Appeals Office).  26 U.S.C. 6330(a) and (b).  A taxpayer\u2019s \nrequest for such a hearing\u2014sometimes called a \u201ccollec-\ntion due process hearing[],\u201d App., infra, 2a\u2014generally \nsuspends \u201cthe levy actions which are the subject of the \nrequested hearing\u201d as well as the running of specified \nlimitations periods.  26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(1). \nAt the hearing itself, the taxpayer may raise \u201cany \nrelevant issue relating to the unpaid tax or the proposed \n\n3 \n \nlevy,\u201d including \u201cchallenges to the appropriateness of \ncollection actions\u201d and \u201coffers of collection alternatives.\u201d  \n26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(A)(ii) and (iii).  The taxpayer may \nalso challenge \u201cthe existence or amount of the underly-\ning tax liability\u201d if the taxpayer \u201cdid not receive any \nstatutory notice of deficiency for such tax liability or did \nnot otherwise have an opportunity to dispute such tax \nliability.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B). \nThe Appeals Office then issues a \u201cdetermination\u201d to \nsustain or reject the proposed levy.  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3).  \nThe taxpayer may petition the United States Tax Court \n\u201cfor review of such determination (and the Tax Court \nshall have jurisdiction with respect to such matter).\u201d  26 \nU.S.C. 6330(d)(1).  The Tax Court\u2019s decision, in turn, is \nsubject to review by a federal court of appeals.  26 U.S.C. \n7482(a)(1). \n2. When a taxpayer overpays her taxes for a partic-\nular year, the IRS \u201cmay credit the amount of such over-\npayment\u201d against the taxpayer\u2019s existing tax \u201cliability\u201d \ninstead of refunding that amount to the taxpayer.  26 \nU.S.C. 6402(a).  That credit is known as an \u201coffset.\u201d  App., \ninfra, 42a.  A taxpayer may challenge the credit through \nthe traditional mechanism for disputing the collection of \na federal tax: a post-deprivation refund suit.  See 26 \nU.S.C. 7422(a).  To bring a refund suit, a taxpayer must \nfirst request a refund from the IRS.  26 U.S.C. 6511, \n7422(a).  If the refund is denied, the taxpayer may sue \nto recover the disputed amount in federal district court \nor the Court of Federal Claims.  26 U.S.C. 7422(a); 28 \nU.S.C. 1346(a)(1), 1491(a)(1). \nB. Factual And Procedural Background \n1. Respondent and Patrick Gennardo were married \nfrom 1993 to 2014.  C.A. App. 273-274.  In 2010 and 2011, \nrespondent and Gennardo paid $50,000 in estimated tax \n\n4 \n \nto the IRS for tax year 2010.  App., infra, 8a.  One pay-\nment was a check for $20,000 that listed both respond-\nent and Gennardo as account holders.  C.A. App. 314.  \nThe other was a check for $30,000 that listed only Gen-\nnardo as an account holder.  Id. at 315. \nIn September 2012, respondent and Gennardo filed \nseparate (and late) federal income-tax returns for tax \nyear 2010.  App., infra, 7a; see C.A. App. 316-381.  Re-\nspondent\u2019s return showed a small overpayment and \nmade no mention of the estimated payments.  C.A. App. \n317.  In contrast, Gennardo\u2019s return showed a liability of \n$385,393 and claimed $10,000 of the estimated payments.  \nId. at 331.  The IRS applied the full $50,000 in estimated \npayments toward Gennardo\u2019s 2010 tax liability.  App., \ninfra, 8a; see C.A. App. 473.  Gennardo applied for, and \nultimately obtained, a compromise settlement that re-\nsolved his share of joint tax liabilities for tax years 2007, \n2008, and 2009, as well as his separate liabilities for tax \nyears 2010 and 2011, based in part on those payments.  \nC.A. App. 277-278, 311, 460, 466, 468. \nMeanwhile, respondent realized that her 2010 return \nhad omitted her income from a retirement distribution.  \nC.A. App. 279, 477.  In November 2012, respondent filed \nan amended return showing additional tax due of $27,682, \nclaiming the full $50,000 in estimated payments, and re-\nquesting a refund of the remainder.  Id. at 475.  Because \nthe IRS had already allocated the $50,000 to Gennardo, \nthe IRS declined to apply the estimated payments to re-\nspondent\u2019s account.  Id. at 280.  Instead, the IRS assessed \nthe additional tax due of $27,682 as reported on her \namended return, along with a late-filing penalty of $7020.  \nId. at 305. \n2. In 2013, the IRS sent respondent a notice and de-\nmand for payment of her balance due.  C.A. App. 280.  \n\n5 \n \nAfter she failed to pay, the IRS sent her a notice of in-\ntent to levy on her property to collect her unpaid taxes.  \nApp., infra, 70a-75a.  Respondent requested a pre-levy \nhearing before the Appeals Office under Section 6330.  \nC.A. App. 567.  She contended that the IRS should have \napplied the full $50,000 in estimated payments to her \naccount, making her underlying tax liability $0.  Ibid.; \nsee App., infra, 10a. \nIn 2014, after a hearing, the Appeals Office issued a \ndetermination sustaining the proposed levy, explaining \nthat the estimated payments could not be applied to re-\nspondent\u2019s account because they had already been ap-\nplied to Gennardo\u2019s account.  App., infra, 61a-67a.  Re-\nspondent petitioned for review, and the Tax Court re-\nmanded to the Appeals Office in 2016 for clarification of \nseveral issues.  C.A. App. 16; App., infra, 50a-60a.  On \nremand, the Appeals Office reaffirmed its prior deter-\nmination to sustain the proposed levy, explaining in a \n2017 supplemental notice of determination that the es-\ntimated payments had been properly allocated to Gen-\nnardo.  App., infra, 44a-49a.  The case returned to the \nTax Court.  Id. at 12a. \nWhile respondent\u2019s pre-levy proceedings were pend-\ning before the Appeals Office and the Tax Court, re-\nspondent overpaid her taxes for tax year 2013 and sub-\nsequent tax years.  App., infra, 12a-13a.  The IRS exer-\ncised its authority under Section 6402(a) to credit her \noverpayments in those years against her 2010 tax liabil-\nity.  Ibid.  By April 15, 2019, those offsets had reduced \nrespondent\u2019s 2010 balance due to $0.  Id. at 13a. \nIn March 2020, the IRS moved to dismiss as moot the \npre-levy proceeding before the Tax Court, explaining \nthat because \u201cthe underlying liability\u201d had been paid, \nthe IRS \u201cno longer intend[ed] to pursue the proposed \n\n6 \n \n[levy].\u201d  App., infra, 42a; see C.A. Doc. 5-4, at 445-458 \n(July 21, 2022).  In April 2022, the Tax Court granted \nthe motion and dismissed respondent\u2019s Section 6330 \ncase seeking review of the proposed levy.  App., infra, \n40a-43a.  The court explained that \u201c[b]ecause there is no \nunpaid liability for the determination year upon which a \nlevy could be based, and [the IRS] is no longer pursuing \nthe proposed [levy], this case is moot.\u201d  Id. at 43a. \n3. The court of appeals vacated the Tax Court\u2019s or-\nder of dismissal and remanded for the Tax Court to de-\ntermine whether respondent was entitled to the esti-\nmated tax payments that the IRS had allocated to Gen-\nnardo.  App., infra, 1a-39a.   \nWhile acknowledging that \u201cthe Tax Court need not \nhear a moot case,\u201d App., infra, 16a, the court of appeals \nheld that the proceedings before the Tax Court were \n\u201cnot moot,\u201d id. at 2a.  In a part of its opinion joined by \nonly two members of the panel, the court of appeals con-\ncluded that the Tax Court has jurisdiction to review re-\nspondent\u2019s \u201c\u200a\u2018underlying tax liability,\u2019\u200a\u201d id. at 26a (cita-\ntion omitted), even if \u201cthe levy is no longer being en-\nforced or the tax is satisfied,\u201d id. at 27a; see id. at 25a-\n39a.  In so concluding, the court of appeals acknowl-\nedged that it was \u201cpart[ing] ways  * * *  with the Fourth \nand D.C. Circuits,\u201d which have held that a Section 6330 \nproceeding is moot when the IRS no longer seeks to \nlevy on a person\u2019s property.  Id. at 27a (citing McLane \nv. Commissioner, 24 F.4th 316 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, \n143 S. Ct. 408 (2022), and Willson v. Commissioner, 805 \nF.3d 316 (D.C. Cir. 2015)).  The court of appeals took \nthe view that even though the IRS no longer sought to \ntake respondent\u2019s property by levy, the Tax Court still \nhad jurisdiction to \u201cdeclare that she had a right to the \nestimated payments.\u201d  Id. at 37a. \n\n7 \n \nIn a part of the court of appeals\u2019 opinion joined by all \nthree members of the panel, the court concluded that the \nTax Court also retained jurisdiction to review whether \nthe IRS had validly exercised its authority under Sec-\ntion 6402 to use respondent\u2019s overpayments to offset \nher 2010 tax liability.  App., infra, 19a-25a.  The court \nacknowledged that \u201c[i]t may be that Congress has not \nexplicitly granted the Tax Court such power\u201d to review \noffset decisions.  Id. at 20a.  But the court of appeals \nviewed such power as \u201cimplicit\u201d in Section 6402.  Id. at \n20a; see id. at 20a-21a.  The court itself then went on to \nconsider the merits of the offset issue, concluding that \n\u201cthe IRS\u2019s setoffs were invalid and without legal effect.\u201d  \nId. at 25a.  The court further concluded that because re-\nspondent\u2019s \u201ctax obligation was not properly set off,\u201d \u201cshe \ncan challenge the IRS\u2019s application of the estimated pay-\nments.\u201d  Id. at 19a. \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \nWhen respondent failed to pay the taxes she owed \nfor a particular tax year, the IRS notified her that it in-\ntended to levy on her property to satisfy her tax liabil-\nity.  Respondent invoked her right to challenge the pro-\nposed levy in a pre-deprivation hearing under 26 U.S.C. \n6330, and the hearing officer sustained the proposed \nlevy.  But while the Section 6330 proceeding was pend-\ning, respondent overpaid her taxes in other tax years, \nand the IRS exercised its statutory authority to credit \nthose overpayments against her outstanding liability\u2014\nreducing her balance due to $0 and eliminating the need \nto levy on her property.  The IRS therefore abandoned \nits proposed levy, and the Tax Court dismissed the Sec-\ntion 6330 proceeding as moot. \nThe court of appeals disagreed, holding that the Sec-\ntion 6330 proceeding is not moot.  The court of appeals \n\n8 \n \nconcluded that the Tax Court has jurisdiction under \nSection 6330 to consider respondent\u2019s challenge to her \ntax liability, even though there is no longer a live dis-\npute over the proposed levy that prompted the Section \n6330 proceeding in the first place.  And the court of ap-\npeals concluded that the Tax Court also has jurisdiction \nto review the IRS\u2019s use of respondent\u2019s overpayments \nto offset her liability, even though Congress has not \u201cex-\nplicitly granted the Tax Court such power\u201d in a Section \n6330 proceeding.  App., infra, 20a (emphasis omitted). \nThe court of appeals\u2019 decision has no basis in the stat-\nute Congress enacted.  It conflicts with the decisions of \nother circuits, as the court itself acknowledged.  And ab-\nsent this Court\u2019s review, the decision below could be used \nto transform the nature of a Section 6330 proceeding\u2014\nexpanding the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction far beyond the \npre-levy proceeding that Congress contemplated.  For \nall of those reasons, the petition for a writ of certiorari \nshould be granted. \nA. The Court Of Appeals\u2019 Decision Is Wrong \nThe court of appeals held that a pre-levy proceeding \nunder Section 6330 is not moot even when there is no \nlonger a live dispute over the proposed levy that gave \nrise to the proceeding.  App., infra, 16a-39a.  That hold-\ning is incorrect. \n1. A pre-levy proceeding under Section 6330 is moot when \nthere is no longer a live dispute over the proposed levy \nthat gave rise to the proceeding \nCongress enacted Section 6330 to provide a mecha-\nnism for pre-deprivation review of an IRS levy to collect \nunpaid taxes.  See p. 2, supra.  Under that provision, a \ntaxpayer is entitled to notice and an opportunity for a \nhearing before the IRS proceeds with a proposed levy \n\n9 \n \non her property.  26 U.S.C. 6330(a) and (b).  And if a hear-\ning officer \u201cdetermin[es]\u201d that the proposed levy may \ngo forward, 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3), the taxpayer may pe-\ntition the Tax Court for review of that \u201cdetermination,\u201d \n26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1). \nWhen the IRS declares that it no longer needs or in-\ntends to take the taxpayer\u2019s property by levy, a pre-levy \nproceeding under Section 6330 becomes moot.  After all, \nthe point of the proceeding is to \u201cdetermin[e]\u201d whether \nthe IRS may proceed with the proposed levy.  26 U.S.C. \n6330(c)(3) and (d)(1).  When the IRS declares that it no \nlonger has any basis for a levy, the issue that prompted \nthe proceeding is no longer \u201c\u200a\u2018live\u2019\u200a\u201d:  The IRS has ceased \nto have any \u201clegally cognizable interest\u201d in a determi-\nnation sustaining the proposed levy, and the taxpayer \nhas ceased to have any \u201clegally cognizable interest\u201d in a \ndetermination rejecting the proposed levy.  Chafin v. \nChafin, 568 U.S. 165, 172 (2013) (citation and some in-\nternal quotation marks omitted). \nHere, the IRS initially pursued a levy to collect re-\nspondent\u2019s balance due for tax year 2010, prompting re-\nspondent to request a pre-levy proceeding under Sec-\ntion 6330.  C.A. App. 563, 567.  But when respondent \noverpaid her taxes in subsequent tax years, the IRS ex-\nercised its statutory authority to credit those overpay-\nments against her 2010 tax liability\u2014thereby reducing \nher balance due to $0 and eliminating the previous need \nto take her property by levy.  App., infra, 12a-13a.  The \nIRS thus informed the Tax Court that it \u201cno longer in-\ntend[ed] to pursue the proposed [levy],\u201d id. at 42a, and \nthe Tax Court correctly deemed the Section 6330 pro-\nceeding \u201cmoot,\u201d id. at 43a. \n\n10 \n \n2. The court of appeals erred in holding that a Section \n6330 proceeding may go on without a live dispute \nover the proposed levy \nThe court of appeals recognized that \u201cthe Tax Court \nneed not hear a moot case.\u201d  App., infra, 16a.  The court \nof appeals also acknowledged that the IRS had \u201cwith-\ndr[awn] its levy\u201d on respondent\u2019s property.  Id. at 25a.  \nThe court nevertheless concluded that the Section 6330 \nproceeding in this case is \u201cnot moot.\u201d  Id. at 16a (capi-\ntalization omitted).  That was error. \na. The Tax Court lacks jurisdiction to consider \n\u201cthe underlying tax liability\u201d when there is no \nlive dispute over the proposed levy \nThe court of appeals reasoned that the Section 6330 \nproceeding is not moot because respondent still dis-\nputes whether the IRS \u201cerroneously allocated\u201d the es-\ntimated payments to Gennardo.  App., infra, 19a.  But \nSection 6330 empowers the Tax Court to review only the \nAppeals Office\u2019s determination to sustain or reject the \nproposed levy.  26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1).  When there is no \nlonger a live dispute over whether the proposed levy \nmay proceed, the pre-levy proceeding \u201cis moot notwith-\nstanding the existence of other live controversies be-\ntween the taxpayer and the IRS that do not fall within \nthe tax court\u2019s jurisdiction\u201d under Section 6330.  Will-\nson v. Commissioner, 805 F.3d 316, 320 (D.C. Cir. 2015). \nThe court of appeals took the view that Section 6330 \ndoes grant the Tax Court jurisdiction to decide whether \nthe IRS properly allocated the estimated payments to \nGennardo.  App., infra, 25a-39a.  The court cited Section \n6330(c)(2)(B), which allows a taxpayer to \u201craise at [a \nSection 6330] hearing the existence or amount of the un-\nderlying tax liability\u201d if the taxpayer \u201cdid not receive \nany statutory notice of deficiency for such tax liability \n\n11 \n \nor did not otherwise have an opportunity to dispute such \ntax liability.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B); see App., infra, \n26a.  But a taxpayer may challenge the existence or \namount of her underlying tax liability under Section \n6330(c)(2)(B)\u2014and may raise \u201cany relevant issue relat-\ning to the unpaid tax,\u201d 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(A)\u2014\u201conly \nin the context of determining whether\u201d the proposed \nlevy may \u201cproceed,\u201d McLane v. Commissioner, 24 F.4th \n316, 319 (4th Cir.) (citation omitted), cert. denied, 143  \nS. Ct. 408 (2022).  When the \u201cproposed levy is moot,\u201d a \ntaxpayer \u201chas no independent basis to challenge the ex-\nistence or amount of her underlying tax liability in [a \nSection 6330] proceeding,\u201d Greene-Thapedi v. Commis-\nsioner, 126 T.C. 1, 8 (2006)\u2014just as she could not have \nused Section 6330 to seek those findings if no levy had \nbeen proposed in the first place. \nThat conclusion follows from the statutory text, which \nrefers to \u201cthe existence or amount of the underlying tax \nliability,\u201d 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B) (emphasis added)\u2014\ni.e., the tax liability \u201cunderlying\u201d the proposed levy.  \nThat language presupposes the existence of a proposed \nlevy, for there is otherwise nothing relevant to Section \n6330 with respect to which the tax liability is \u201cunderly-\ning.\u201d  Ibid.  Section 6330(c)(2)(B) thus allows a taxpayer \nto challenge the existence or amount of her tax liability \n\u201conly in connection with her challenge to the proposed \n[levy].\u201d  Greene-Thapedi, 126 T.C. at 8.  Here, because \nthe IRS no longer wishes (nor has any need) to pursue \nthe proposed levy, the court of appeals erred in conclud-\ning that the Tax Court has jurisdiction to consider re-\nspondent\u2019s challenge to \u201cthe underlying tax liability.\u201d  \n26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B). \n\n12 \n \nb. The Tax Court lacks jurisdiction to review offsets \nin a Section 6330 proceeding \nThe court of appeals also reasoned that the Section \n6330 proceeding is \u201cnot moot because the IRS\u2019s setoffs \nwere invalid.\u201d  App., infra, 19a (capitalization omitted).  \nBut \u201c[t]he Tax Court is a court of limited jurisdiction.\u201d  \nCommissioner v.

A petition for rehearing was denied on \nJune 26, 2024 (App., infra, 68a-69a).  On September 12, \n2024, Justice Alito extended the time within which to \nfile a petition for a writ of certiorari to and including \n\n2 \n \nOctober 11, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court is in-\nvoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent statutory provisions are reproduced in an \nappendix to this petition.  App., infra, 76a-84a. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal Background \n1. When a taxpayer who is \u201cliable to pay any tax ne-\nglects or refuses to pay,\u201d the Internal Revenue Service \n(IRS) may (with certain exceptions) \u201ccollect such tax\u201d \nby \u201clevy[ing] upon\u201d the taxpayer\u2019s property.  26 U.S.C. \n6331(a).  Before 1998, the Internal Revenue Code au-\nthorized the IRS to levy upon taxpayer property with-\nout any prior opportunity for a hearing or other pre- \ncollection process, so long as there were adequate post-\ndeprivation procedures.  See Phillips v. Commissioner, \n283 U.S. 589, 595 (1931).  In 1998, however, Congress es-\ntablished various procedures that the IRS generally \nmust follow before levying.  See Taxpayer Bill of Rights \n3, Pub. L. No. 105-206, Tit. III, \u00a7 3401(b), 112 Stat. 747-\n749 (codified at 26 U.S.C. 6330). \nUnder those procedures, a taxpayer whose property \nthe IRS seeks to take by levy generally must be notified \nat least 30 days before the levy of the right to request a \nhearing before the IRS Independent Office of Appeals \n(Appeals Office).  26 U.S.C. 6330(a) and (b).  A taxpayer\u2019s \nrequest for such a hearing\u2014sometimes called a \u201ccollec-\ntion due process hearing[],\u201d App., infra, 2a\u2014generally \nsuspends \u201cthe levy actions which are the subject of the \nrequested hearing\u201d as well as the running of specified \nlimitations periods.  26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(1). \nAt the hearing itself, the taxpayer may raise \u201cany \nrelevant issue relating to the unpaid tax or the proposed \n\n3 \n \nlevy,\u201d including \u201cchallenges to the appropriateness of \ncollection actions\u201d and \u201coffers of collection alternatives.\u201d  \n26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(A)(ii) and (iii).  The taxpayer may \nalso challenge \u201cthe existence or amount of the underly-\ning tax liability\u201d if the taxpayer \u201cdid not receive any \nstatutory notice of deficiency for such tax liability or did \nnot otherwise have an opportunity to dispute such tax \nliability.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B). \nThe Appeals Office then issues a \u201cdetermination\u201d to \nsustain or reject the proposed levy.  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3).  \nThe taxpayer may petition the United States Tax Court \n\u201cfor review of such determination (and the Tax Court \nshall have jurisdiction with respect to such matter).\u201d  26 \nU.S.C. 6330(d)(1).  The Tax Court\u2019s decision, in turn, is \nsubject to review by a federal court of appeals.  26 U.S.C. \n7482(a)(1). \n2. When a taxpayer overpays her taxes for a partic-\nular year, the IRS \u201cmay credit the amount of such over-\npayment\u201d against the taxpayer\u2019s existing tax \u201cliability\u201d \ninstead of refunding that amount to the taxpayer.  26 \nU.S.C. 6402(a).  That credit is known as an \u201coffset.\u201d  App., \ninfra, 42a.  A taxpayer may challenge the credit through \nthe traditional mechanism for disputing the collection of \na federal tax: a post-deprivation refund suit.  See 26 \nU.S.C. 7422(a).  To bring a refund suit, a taxpayer must \nfirst request a refund from the IRS.  26 U.S.C. 6511, \n7422(a).  If the refund is denied, the taxpayer may sue \nto recover the disputed amount in federal district court \nor the Court of Federal Claims.  26 U.S.C. 7422(a); 28 \nU.S.C. 1346(a)(1), 1491(a)(1). \nB. Factual And Procedural Background \n1. Respondent and Patrick Gennardo were married \nfrom 1993 to 2014.  C.A. App. 273-274.  In 2010 and 2011, \nrespondent and Gennardo paid $50,000 in estimated tax \n\n4 \n \nto the IRS for tax year 2010.  App., infra, 8a.  One pay-\nment was a check for $20,000 that listed both respond-\nent and Gennardo as account holders.  C.A. App. 314.  \nThe other was a check for $30,000 that listed only Gen-\nnardo as an account holder.  Id. at 315. \nIn September 2012, respondent and Gennardo filed \nseparate (and late) federal income-tax returns for tax \nyear 2010.  App., infra, 7a; see C.A. App. 316-381.  Re-\nspondent\u2019s return showed a small overpayment and \nmade no mention of the estimated payments.  C.A. App. \n317.  In contrast, Gennardo\u2019s return showed a liability of \n$385,393 and claimed $10,000 of the estimated payments.  \nId. at 331.  The IRS applied the full $50,000 in estimated \npayments toward Gennardo\u2019s 2010 tax liability.  App., \ninfra, 8a; see C.A. App. 473.  Gennardo applied for, and \nultimately obtained, a compromise settlement that re-\nsolved his share of joint tax liabilities for tax years 2007, \n2008, and 2009, as well as his separate liabilities for tax \nyears 2010 and 2011, based in part on those payments.  \nC.A. App. 277-278, 311, 460, 466, 468. \nMeanwhile, respondent realized that her 2010 return \nhad omitted her income from a retirement distribution.  \nC.A. App. 279, 477.  In November 2012, respondent filed \nan amended return showing additional tax due of $27,682, \nclaiming the full $50,000 in estimated payments, and re-\nquesting a refund of the remainder.  Id. at 475.  Because \nthe IRS had already allocated the $50,000 to Gennardo, \nthe IRS declined to apply the estimated payments to re-\nspondent\u2019s account.  Id. at 280.  Instead, the IRS assessed \nthe additional tax due of $27,682 as reported on her \namended return, along with a late-filing penalty of $7020.  \nId. at 305. \n2. In 2013, the IRS sent respondent a notice and de-\nmand for payment of her balance due.  C.A. App. 280.  \n\n5 \n \nAfter she failed to pay, the IRS sent her a notice of in-\ntent to levy on her property to collect her unpaid taxes.  \nApp., infra, 70a-75a.  Respondent requested a pre-levy \nhearing before the Appeals Office under Section 6330.  \nC.A. App. 567.  She contended that the IRS should have \napplied the full $50,000 in estimated payments to her \naccount, making her underlying tax liability $0.  Ibid.; \nsee App., infra, 10a. \nIn 2014, after a hearing, the Appeals Office issued a \ndetermination sustaining the proposed levy, explaining \nthat the estimated payments could not be applied to re-\nspondent\u2019s account because they had already been ap-\nplied to Gennardo\u2019s account.  App., infra, 61a-67a.  Re-\nspondent petitioned for review, and the Tax Court re-\nmanded to the Appeals Office in 2016 for clarification of \nseveral issues.  C.A. App. 16; App., infra, 50a-60a.  On \nremand, the Appeals Office reaffirmed its prior deter-\nmination to sustain the proposed levy, explaining in a \n2017 supplemental notice of determination that the es-\ntimated payments had been properly allocated to Gen-\nnardo.  App., infra, 44a-49a.  The case returned to the \nTax Court.  Id. at 12a. \nWhile respondent\u2019s pre-levy proceedings were pend-\ning before the Appeals Office and the Tax Court, re-\nspondent overpaid her taxes for tax year 2013 and sub-\nsequent tax years.  App., infra, 12a-13a.  The IRS exer-\ncised its authority under Section 6402(a) to credit her \noverpayments in those years against her 2010 tax liabil-\nity.  Ibid.  By April 15, 2019, those offsets had reduced \nrespondent\u2019s 2010 balance due to $0.  Id. at 13a. \nIn March 2020, the IRS moved to dismiss as moot the \npre-levy proceeding before the Tax Court, explaining \nthat because \u201cthe underlying liability\u201d had been paid, \nthe IRS \u201cno longer intend[ed] to pursue the proposed \n\n6 \n \n[levy].\u201d  App., infra, 42a; see C.A. Doc. 5-4, at 445-458 \n(July 21, 2022).  In April 2022, the Tax Court granted \nthe motion and dismissed respondent\u2019s Section 6330 \ncase seeking review of the proposed levy.  App., infra, \n40a-43a.  The court explained that \u201c[b]ecause there is no \nunpaid liability for the determination year upon which a \nlevy could be based, and [the IRS] is no longer pursuing \nthe proposed [levy], this case is moot.\u201d  Id. at 43a. \n3. The court of appeals vacated the Tax Court\u2019s or-\nder of dismissal and remanded for the Tax Court to de-\ntermine whether respondent was entitled to the esti-\nmated tax payments that the IRS had allocated to Gen-\nnardo.  App., infra, 1a-39a.   \nWhile acknowledging that \u201cthe Tax Court need not \nhear a moot case,\u201d App., infra, 16a, the court of appeals \nheld that the proceedings before the Tax Court were \n\u201cnot moot,\u201d id. at 2a.  In a part of its opinion joined by \nonly two members of the panel, the court of appeals con-\ncluded that the Tax Court has jurisdiction to review re-\nspondent\u2019s \u201c\u200a\u2018underlying tax liability,\u2019\u200a\u201d id. at 26a (cita-\ntion omitted), even if \u201cthe levy is no longer being en-\nforced or the tax is satisfied,\u201d id. at 27a; see id. at 25a-\n39a.  In so concluding, the court of appeals acknowl-\nedged that it was \u201cpart[ing] ways  * * *  with the Fourth \nand D.C. Circuits,\u201d which have held that a Section 6330 \nproceeding is moot when the IRS no longer seeks to \nlevy on a person\u2019s property.  Id. at 27a (citing McLane \nv. Commissioner, 24 F.4th 316 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, \n143 S. Ct. 408 (2022), and Willson v. Commissioner, 805 \nF.3d 316 (D.C. Cir. 2015)).  The court of appeals took \nthe view that even though the IRS no longer sought to \ntake respondent\u2019s property by levy, the Tax Court still \nhad jurisdiction to \u201cdeclare that she had a right to the \nestimated payments.\u201d  Id. at 37a. \n\n7 \n \nIn a part of the court of appeals\u2019 opinion joined by all \nthree members of the panel, the court concluded that the \nTax Court also retained jurisdiction to review whether \nthe IRS had validly exercised its authority under Sec-\ntion 6402 to use respondent\u2019s overpayments to offset \nher 2010 tax liability.  App., infra, 19a-25a.  The court \nacknowledged that \u201c[i]t may be that Congress has not \nexplicitly granted the Tax Court such power\u201d to review \noffset decisions.  Id. at 20a.  But the court of appeals \nviewed such power as \u201cimplicit\u201d in Section 6402.  Id. at \n20a; see id. at 20a-21a.  The court itself then went on to \nconsider the merits of the offset issue, concluding that \n\u201cthe IRS\u2019s setoffs were invalid and without legal effect.\u201d  \nId. at 25a.  The court further concluded that because re-\nspondent\u2019s \u201ctax obligation was not properly set off,\u201d \u201cshe \ncan challenge the IRS\u2019s application of the estimated pay-\nments.\u201d  Id. at 19a. \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \nWhen respondent failed to pay the taxes she owed \nfor a particular tax year, the IRS notified her that it in-\ntended to levy on her property to satisfy her tax liabil-\nity.  Respondent invoked her right to challenge the pro-\nposed levy in a pre-deprivation hearing under 26 U.S.C. \n6330, and the hearing officer sustained the proposed \nlevy.  But while the Section 6330 proceeding was pend-\ning, respondent overpaid her taxes in other tax years, \nand the IRS exercised its statutory authority to credit \nthose overpayments against her outstanding liability\u2014\nreducing her balance due to $0 and eliminating the need \nto levy on her property.  The IRS therefore abandoned \nits proposed levy, and the Tax Court dismissed the Sec-\ntion 6330 proceeding as moot. \nThe court of appeals disagreed, holding that the Sec-\ntion 6330 proceeding is not moot.  The court of appeals \n\n8 \n \nconcluded that the Tax Court has jurisdiction under \nSection 6330 to consider respondent\u2019s challenge to her \ntax liability, even though there is no longer a live dis-\npute over the proposed levy that prompted the Section \n6330 proceeding in the first place.  And the court of ap-\npeals concluded that the Tax Court also has jurisdiction \nto review the IRS\u2019s use of respondent\u2019s overpayments \nto offset her liability, even though Congress has not \u201cex-\nplicitly granted the Tax Court such power\u201d in a Section \n6330 proceeding.  App., infra, 20a (emphasis omitted). \nThe court of appeals\u2019 decision has no basis in the stat-\nute Congress enacted.  It conflicts with the decisions of \nother circuits, as the court itself acknowledged.  And ab-\nsent this Court\u2019s review, the decision below could be used \nto transform the nature of a Section 6330 proceeding\u2014\nexpanding the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction far beyond the \npre-levy proceeding that Congress contemplated.  For \nall of those reasons, the petition for a writ of certiorari \nshould be granted. \nA. The Court Of Appeals\u2019 Decision Is Wrong \nThe court of appeals held that a pre-levy proceeding \nunder Section 6330 is not moot even when there is no \nlonger a live dispute over the proposed levy that gave \nrise to the proceeding.  App., infra, 16a-39a.  That hold-\ning is incorrect. \n1. A pre-levy proceeding under Section 6330 is moot when \nthere is no longer a live dispute over the proposed levy \nthat gave rise to the proceeding \nCongress enacted Section 6330 to provide a mecha-\nnism for pre-deprivation review of an IRS levy to collect \nunpaid taxes.  See p. 2, supra.  Under that provision, a \ntaxpayer is entitled to notice and an opportunity for a \nhearing before the IRS proceeds with a proposed levy \n\n9 \n \non her property.  26 U.S.C. 6330(a) and (b).  And if a hear-\ning officer \u201cdetermin[es]\u201d that the proposed levy may \ngo forward, 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3), the taxpayer may pe-\ntition the Tax Court for review of that \u201cdetermination,\u201d \n26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1). \nWhen the IRS declares that it no longer needs or in-\ntends to take the taxpayer\u2019s property by levy, a pre-levy \nproceeding under Section 6330 becomes moot.  After all, \nthe point of the proceeding is to \u201cdetermin[e]\u201d whether \nthe IRS may proceed with the proposed levy.  26 U.S.C. \n6330(c)(3) and (d)(1).  When the IRS declares that it no \nlonger has any basis for a levy, the issue that prompted \nthe proceeding is no longer \u201c\u200a\u2018live\u2019\u200a\u201d:  The IRS has ceased \nto have any \u201clegally cognizable interest\u201d in a determi-\nnation sustaining the proposed levy, and the taxpayer \nhas ceased to have any \u201clegally cognizable interest\u201d in a \ndetermination rejecting the proposed levy.  Chafin v. \nChafin, 568 U.S. 165, 172 (2013) (citation and some in-\nternal quotation marks omitted). \nHere, the IRS initially pursued a levy to collect re-\nspondent\u2019s balance due for tax year 2010, prompting re-\nspondent to request a pre-levy proceeding under Sec-\ntion 6330.  C.A. App. 563, 567.  But when respondent \noverpaid her taxes in subsequent tax years, the IRS ex-\nercised its statutory authority to credit those overpay-\nments against her 2010 tax liability\u2014thereby reducing \nher balance due to $0 and eliminating the previous need \nto take her property by levy.  App., infra, 12a-13a.  The \nIRS thus informed the Tax Court that it \u201cno longer in-\ntend[ed] to pursue the proposed [levy],\u201d id. at 42a, and \nthe Tax Court correctly deemed the Section 6330 pro-\nceeding \u201cmoot,\u201d id. at 43a. \n\n10 \n \n2. The court of appeals erred in holding that a Section \n6330 proceeding may go on without a live dispute \nover the proposed levy \nThe court of appeals recognized that \u201cthe Tax Court \nneed not hear a moot case.\u201d  App., infra, 16a.  The court \nof appeals also acknowledged that the IRS had \u201cwith-\ndr[awn] its levy\u201d on respondent\u2019s property.  Id. at 25a.  \nThe court nevertheless concluded that the Section 6330 \nproceeding in this case is \u201cnot moot.\u201d  Id. at 16a (capi-\ntalization omitted).  That was error. \na. The Tax Court lacks jurisdiction to consider \n\u201cthe underlying tax liability\u201d when there is no \nlive dispute over the proposed levy \nThe court of appeals reasoned that the Section 6330 \nproceeding is not moot because respondent still dis-\nputes whether the IRS \u201cerroneously allocated\u201d the es-\ntimated payments to Gennardo.  App., infra, 19a.  But \nSection 6330 empowers the Tax Court to review only the \nAppeals Office\u2019s determination to sustain or reject the \nproposed levy.  26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1).  When there is no \nlonger a live dispute over whether the proposed levy \nmay proceed, the pre-levy proceeding \u201cis moot notwith-\nstanding the existence of other live controversies be-\ntween the taxpayer and the IRS that do not fall within \nthe tax court\u2019s jurisdiction\u201d under Section 6330.  Will-\nson v. Commissioner, 805 F.3d 316, 320 (D.C. Cir. 2015). \nThe court of appeals took the view that Section 6330 \ndoes grant the Tax Court jurisdiction to decide whether \nthe IRS properly allocated the estimated payments to \nGennardo.  App., infra, 25a-39a.  The court cited Section \n6330(c)(2)(B), which allows a taxpayer to \u201craise at [a \nSection 6330] hearing the existence or amount of the un-\nderlying tax liability\u201d if the taxpayer \u201cdid not receive \nany statutory notice of deficiency for such tax liability \n\n11 \n \nor did not otherwise have an opportunity to dispute such \ntax liability.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B); see App., infra, \n26a.  But a taxpayer may challenge the existence or \namount of her underlying tax liability under Section \n6330(c)(2)(B)\u2014and may raise \u201cany relevant issue relat-\ning to the unpaid tax,\u201d 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(A)\u2014\u201conly \nin the context of determining whether\u201d the proposed \nlevy may \u201cproceed,\u201d McLane v. Commissioner, 24 F.4th \n316, 319 (4th Cir.) (citation omitted), cert. denied, 143  \nS. Ct. 408 (2022).  When the \u201cproposed levy is moot,\u201d a \ntaxpayer \u201chas no independent basis to challenge the ex-\nistence or amount of her underlying tax liability in [a \nSection 6330] proceeding,\u201d Greene-Thapedi v. Commis-\nsioner, 126 T.C. 1, 8 (2006)\u2014just as she could not have \nused Section 6330 to seek those findings if no levy had \nbeen proposed in the first place. \nThat conclusion follows from the statutory text, which \nrefers to \u201cthe existence or amount of the underlying tax \nliability,\u201d 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B) (emphasis added)\u2014\ni.e., the tax liability \u201cunderlying\u201d the proposed levy.  \nThat language presupposes the existence of a proposed \nlevy, for there is otherwise nothing relevant to Section \n6330 with respect to which the tax liability is \u201cunderly-\ning.\u201d  Ibid.  Section 6330(c)(2)(B) thus allows a taxpayer \nto challenge the existence or amount of her tax liability \n\u201conly in connection with her challenge to the proposed \n[levy].\u201d  Greene-Thapedi, 126 T.C. at 8.  Here, because \nthe IRS no longer wishes (nor has any need) to pursue \nthe proposed levy, the court of appeals erred in conclud-\ning that the Tax Court has jurisdiction to consider re-\nspondent\u2019s challenge to \u201cthe underlying tax liability.\u201d  \n26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B). \n\n12 \n \nb. The Tax Court lacks jurisdiction to review offsets \nin a Section 6330 proceeding \nThe court of appeals also reasoned that the Section \n6330 proceeding is \u201cnot moot because the IRS\u2019s setoffs \nwere invalid.\u201d  App., infra, 19a (capitalization omitted).  \nBut \u201c[t]he Tax Court is a court of limited jurisdiction.\u201d  \nCommissioner v. McCoy, 484 U.S. 3, 7 (1987) (per cu-\nriam).  And nothing in Section 6330 grants the Tax Court \njurisdiction to review the IRS\u2019s exercise of authority \nunder Section 6402(a) to credit a taxpayer\u2019s overpay-\nments against her tax liability.  See 26 U.S.C. 6330(c) \nand (d). \nThe court of appeals did not suggest otherwise.  In-\nstead, the court pointed to Section 6402(a) itself, which \nauthorizes the IRS to \u201ccredit the amount of [an] over-\npayment, including any interest allowed thereon, against \nany liability in respect of an internal revenue tax on the \npart of the person who made the overpayment.\u201d  26 U.S.C. \n6402(a); see App., infra, 20a-21a.  The court of appeals \nreasoned that even if Section 6402(a) does \u201cnot explicitly \ngrant[]\u201d the Tax Court jurisdiction to review the IRS\u2019s \ncrediting of overpayments against a taxpayer\u2019s liability, \nthat provision should be read to contain \u201can implicit \ngrant\u201d of such power.  App., infra, 20a.  As a court of lim-\nited jurisdiction, however, the Tax Court possesses only \nthe jurisdiction that Congress has \u201cexpressly author-\nized.\u201d  Willson, 805 F.3d at 320 (citation omitted).  And \nbecause Congress has not expressly authorized the Tax \nCourt to review offsets in a Section 6330 proceeding, the \ncourt of appeals erred in concluding that the Tax Court \nhad such jurisdiction.1 \n \n1 In reaching out to decide the issue that it mistakenly found to be \nwithin the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction, the court of appeals also erred \nin concluding that the offsets against respondent\u2019s tax liability were \n\n13 \n \nMoreover, even if the Tax Court had jurisdiction to \nreview offsets in a Section 6330 proceeding, the court of \nappeals still erred in concluding that this Section 6330 \nproceeding is not moot.  The court of appeals assumed \nthat if the Tax Court had jurisdiction to review the \nIRS\u2019s use of respondent\u2019s overpayments to offset her \ntax liability, and if those offsets were invalid, the Tax \nCourt would then have jurisdiction to consider respond-\nent\u2019s challenge to \u201cthe IRS\u2019s application of the esti-\nmated payments.\u201d  App., infra, 19a.  But the Tax Court \nwould have jurisdiction under Section 6330 to consider \nsuch a challenge only in connection with a live dispute \nover a proposed levy.  See pp. 10-11, supra.  And a court \ncannot manufacture such a dispute merely by deeming \nthe offsets invalid.  After all, the IRS has no basis for pur-\nsuing a levy so long as the overpayments that respond-\nent made remain \u201cin the government\u2019s pocket.\u201d  App., in-\nfra, 25a.  And not even the court of appeals suggested that \nthe Tax Court would be able to order the IRS to refund \nthose overpayments.2  Cf. Greene-Thapedi, 126 T.C. at 8 \n \ninvalid.  App., infra, 22a-25a.  The court took the view that the off-\nsets violated the common-law rule that \u201ca creditor cannot set off a \ndisputed debt with an undisputed one.\u201d  Id. at 22a.  But that rule has \nno application under Section 6402(a), which authorizes the IRS to \n\u201ccredit the amount of [an] overpayment  * * *  against any liability,\u201d \nundisputed or not.  26 U.S.C. 6402(a).  The court also believed that \nthe offsets violated \u201cArticle III mootness principles.\u201d  App., infra, \n25a.  But no such principles limit the IRS\u2019s exercise of its authority \nunder Section 6402(a). \n2 Although the court of appeals declined to \u201creach any conclusion \nabout whether the Tax Court has overpayment or refund jurisdic-\ntion in a context like this,\u201d App., infra, 34a n.38, the court of appeals \ndid suggest that the Tax Court could \u201cdeclare that [respondent] had \na right to the estimated payments,\u201d id. at 37a.  But Congress has \nexpressly barred \u201cany court of the United States\u201d from issuing de-\nclaratory relief \u201cwith respect to Federal taxes.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2201(a).  \n\n14 \n \n(holding that the Tax Court lacks \u201cjurisdiction\u201d under \nSection 6330 to \u201corder a refund or credit of taxes paid\u201d).  \nThus, even if the offsets were invalid, the Section 6330 \nproceeding in this case would still be moot. \nNone of this is to say that taxpayers may not chal-\nlenge the IRS\u2019s allocation of estimated payments or its \nuse of overpayments to offset their liability.  Taxpayers \nmay do so through a post-deprivation suit for a refund\u2014\nthe traditional mechanism for disputing the assessment \nor collection of a federal tax.  See 26 U.S.C. 7422(a); 28 \nU.S.C. 1346(a)(1), 1491(a)(1).  The proceeding at issue \nhere, however, is a pre-deprivation proceeding for chal-\nlenging a particular method of collection: a proposed \nlevy.  Because the IRS no longer seeks to deprive re-\nspondent of any property by levy, the pre-deprivation \nproceeding in this case is moot. \nB. The Question Presented Warrants This Court\u2019s Review  \n1. As the court of appeals acknowledged, its decision \nin this case \u201cpart[s] ways  * * *  with the Fourth and \nD.C. Circuits.\u201d  App., infra, 27a.   \nIn an opinion by Judge Henderson, joined by then-\nJudge Kavanaugh and Judge Pillard, the D.C. Circuit in \nWillson held that a Section 6330 proceeding is \u201c\u200a\u2018moot\u2019\u200a\u201d \nwhen \u201c[t]he IRS no longer seeks to levy on [the tax-\npayer\u2019s] property.\u201d  805 F.3d at 321 (citation omitted).  \nThe IRS in that case had \u201cabandoned its levy\u201d after de-\ntermining that the taxpayer had no \u201c\u200a\u2018underlying tax li-\nability.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at 320-321.  The D.C. Circuit explained that \nthe absence of a pending levy was \u201cthe very relief [that \nthe taxpayer] ostensibly sought when he requested a \n[Section 6330] hearing to challenge the proposed levy in \n \nThe only relief that Section 6330 authorizes is rejection of a pro-\nposed levy.  See Willson, 805 F.3d at 321. \n\n15 \n \nthe first place.\u201d  Id. at 321.  And the D.C. Circuit con-\ncluded that because the taxpayer had \u201creceived all the \nrelief that section 6330 authorize[d] the tax court to \ngrant him,\u201d \u201c\u200a\u2018there was no appropriate course of action \nfor the Tax Court to take but to dismiss [his case] as \nmoot.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (brackets and citation omitted); see Byers \nv. Commissioner, 740 F.3d 668, 679 (D.C. Cir.) (simi-\nlarly concluding that the IRS\u2019s decision to abandon its \npursuit of a proposed levy meant that the Section 6330 \nproceeding that the taxpayer had requested was \u201cmoot\u201d), \ncert. denied, 574 U.S. 872 (2014). \nIn McLane, the Fourth Circuit reached the same con-\nclusion, holding that a Section 6330 proceeding is \u201cmoot\u201d \nwhen the IRS has \u201calready conceded that a taxpayer \nhas no tax liability\u201d and the taxpayer \u201cno longer faces\u201d \na levy.  24 F.4th at 319.  The taxpayer in that case had \nargued that even though the IRS had abandoned its levy, \n\u201cthe phrase \u2018underlying tax liability\u2019  * * *  confer[red] \njurisdiction on the Tax Court to determine that he [had] \noverpaid [his taxes in a particular year] and order a re-\nfund.\u201d  Id. at 318.  The Fourth Circuit rejected that con-\ntention, explaining that \u201cthe phrase \u2018underlying tax liabil-\nity\u2019\u200a\u201d must be read in \u201c\u200a\u2018the specific context in which that \nlanguage is used.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at 319 (citation omitted).  View-\ning that context as \u201cthe IRS\u2019s attempt to collect via lien \nor levy,\u201d the Fourth Circuit concluded that \u201cthe \u2018tax-\npayer was permitted to challenge the amount of his un-\nderlying liability in the [Section 6330] hearing  . . .  only \nin the context of determining whether the collection ac-\ntion could proceed.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (citation omitted).  And be-\ncause the taxpayer \u201cno longer face[d] such an action,\u201d \nibid., the Fourth Circuit affirmed the Tax Court\u2019s deci-\nsion to dismiss the taxpayer\u2019s case, see id. at 318-319. \n\n16 \n \nThe court of appeals in this case correctly recognized \nthat its decision conflicts with Willson and McLane.  \nApp., infra, 27a.  Unlike the D.C. and Fourth Circuits, \nthe court of appeals in this case held that a Section 6330 \nproceeding is \u201cnot moot\u201d even though the IRS no longer \nseeks to levy on the taxpayer\u2019s property.  Id. at 16a (cap-\nitalization omitted); see id. at 16a-39a.  Contrary to the \nFourth Circuit\u2019s decision in McLane, the court of ap-\npeals in this case also held that a taxpayer may continue \nto challenge her \u201cunderlying tax liability\u201d under Section \n6330(c)(2)(B) even after the IRS has abandoned its levy.  \nId. at 27a; see ibid. (declining to read \u201c\u200a\u2018underlying tax \nliability\u2019\u200a\u201d as \u201cnarrowly\u201d as the Fourth Circuit).  This \nCourt\u2019s review is warranted to resolve the conflict be-\ntween the decision below and the decisions of the D.C. \nand Fourth Circuits. \n2. The decision below also conflicts with the deci-\nsions of other circuits recognizing that the Tax Court \npossesses only that jurisdiction \u201cexpressly authorized \nby Congress.\u201d  Willson, 805 F.3d at 320 (D.C. Cir.) (ci-\ntation omitted); see Borenstein v. Commissioner, 919 \nF.3d 746, 749 (2d Cir. 2019); McLane, 24 F.4th at 318 \n(4th Cir.); Sanders v. Commissioner, 813 F.2d 859, 861 \n(7th Cir. 1987); see also Brown v. Commissioner, 58 \nF.4th 1064, 1067 (9th Cir. 2023) (recognizing that the \nTax Court \u201chas only the jurisdiction specifically granted \nby statute and lacks the authority to expand upon that \nstatutory grant\u201d).  Despite acknowledging that principle, \nApp., infra, 14a, the decision below departed from it in \nconcluding that the Tax Court had \u201cimplicit\u201d jurisdic-\ntion \u201cto review setoffs\u201d and in rejecting the need to point \nto any \u201cexplicit[]\u201d grant of such authority, id. at 20a. \n3. Finally, the decision below threatens significant \npractical consequences.  There are tens of thousands of  \n\n17 \n \nSection 6330 proceedings each year.  See Treasury In-\nspector Gen. for Tax Admin., U.S. Dep\u2019t of the Treas-\nury, Report No. 2023-10-038, Review of the IRS Inde-\npendent Office of Appeals Collection Due Process Pro-\ngram 7 (July 21, 2023), perma.cc/DVL7-9HA8 (report-\ning 28,349 closed Section 6330 cases in 2023).  Absent this \nCourt\u2019s review, the decision below could be invoked to \nconvert many of those proceedings from a limited op-\nportunity for pre-deprivation review into a more gen-\neral forum for considering challenges to tax liability\u2014\nexpanding the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction under Section \n6330 far beyond what Congress contemplated.  See App., \ninfra, 28a.  Review of the court of appeals\u2019 decision trans-\nforming the nature of Section 6330 proceedings, and de-\nparting from Congress\u2019s intent and the decisions of \nother circuits, is warranted. \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be granted. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nELIZABETH B.

Carluzzo \n \nBefore:  JORDAN, KRAUSE, and BIBAS*, Circuit Judges \nOPINION OF THE COURT1 \nJORDAN, Circuit Judge. \nWhen Congress grants taxpayers the right to chal-\nlenge what the Internal Revenue Service says is owed to \nthe government, Congress\u2019s will prevails.  The IRS \ncannot say that such a right exists only under the cir-\n \n* We requested briefing on certain issues from Audrey Patten, Es-\nquire, of the Harvard Law Tax Litigation Clinic, whom we appointed \nas Amicus Curiae. We are grateful for the thoughtful insights pro-\nvided by Ms. Patten and the Clinic. \n1  Judge Bibas joins the opinion in full except for Section II.C.3. \n\n2a \n \ncumstances it prescribes.  That ought to go without \nsaying, but this case requires us to say it. \nThe IRS sent Jennifer Zuch a notice informing her \nthat it intended to levy on her property to collect unpaid \ntax.  She challenged the levy, arguing that she had pre-\npaid the tax.  The IRS Independent Office of Appeals \n(the \u201cIRS Office of Appeals\u201d) sustained the levy, and \nZuch petitioned the United States Tax Court for review \nof that decision.  While the issue was being litigated in \nthat Court over several years, the IRS withheld tax re-\nfunds owed to Zuch and applied them to what it said was \nher unpaid balance, satisfying it in full.  When, accord-\ning to the IRS\u2019s accounting, there was no more tax to be \npaid, the IRS filed a motion to dismiss the Tax Court \nproceeding for mootness, and the Court granted the mo-\ntion. \nBecause Zuch\u2019s claim is not moot, we will vacate the \ndismissal and remand this matter to the Tax Court to \ndetermine whether Zuch\u2019s petition is meritorious. \nI. \nBACKGROUND \nA. \nOverview of Tax Court Proceedings \nSome understanding of tax procedure is essential to \nthe consideration of this case, so we begin with a brief \nsummary of the two basic pathways by which taxpayers \ncan dispute what they owe the government before the \nIRS collects:  deficiency proceedings and collection \ndue process hearings.2  After addressing a key ques-\ntion related to these pathways\u2014the distinction between \n \n2  If a taxpayer wishes to dispute what he owes after the IRS col-\nlects, he must file a refund action in a federal district court or the \nCourt of Federal Claims.  26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7422. \n\n3a \n \nunpaid tax and tax liability\u2014we turn to the factual and \nprocedural background that led to this appeal. \n1.  Deficiency Proceedings \nWhen the IRS decides that a taxpayer owes more \nthan the amount reported on her tax return, it mails the \ntaxpayer a \u201cnotice of  . . .  deficiency.\u201d3  26 U.S.C.  \n\u00a7 6212(a).4  The taxpayer may challenge the IRS\u2019s tax \ndetermination before collection by filing a petition in the \nTax Court within ninety days after the mailing of the \nnotice of deficiency.  \u00a7 6213(a).  Such a petition com-\nmences a \u201cdeficiency proceeding[].\u201d  Cooper v. Comm\u2019r, \n718 F.3d 216, 223 (3d Cir. 2013).  Deficiency proceed-\nings are \u201c[t]he Tax Court\u2019s principal basis for jurisdic-\ntion[.]\u201d  Sunoco Inc. v. Comm\u2019r, 663 F.3d 181, 187 (3d \nCir. 2011).  In a deficiency proceeding, the Tax Court \nhas jurisdiction to determine the correct amount of tax \nowed, \u00a7 6214(a), and to order that any overpayments be \nrefunded to a taxpayer, \u00a7 6512(b)(1).  The Tax Court\u2019s \nfinal order in a deficiency proceeding is subject to re-\nview by an Article III court.  \u00a7 7482(a)(1). \n2.  Collection Due Process Proceedings \nIf a taxpayer does not pay the amount the IRS says \nis due, the IRS can levy\u2014that is, seize and sell\u2014a tax-\n \n3  A notice of deficiency is a \u201cjurisdictional prerequisite\u201d to liti-\ngate the merits of the IRS\u2019s deficiency determination in the Tax \nCourt.  Laing v. United States, 423 U.S. 161, 165 n.4 (1976).  We \nhave called the notice of deficiency the taxpayer\u2019s \u201cticket to the Tax \nCourt[.]\u201d  Robinson v. United States, 920 F.2d 1157, 1158 (3d Cir. \n1990) (internal quotation marks omitted). \n4  Unless otherwise indicated, all section references in the remain-\nder of this opinion are to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as \namended, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 et seq. \n\n4a \n \npayer\u2019s property to satisfy the tax liability.  \u00a7 6331(a).  \nBut, before it does so, it must provide the taxpayer no-\ntice and an opportunity for a hearing to contest the levy. \n\u00a7 6330(a)(1).  After the IRS sends notice to the tax-\npayer of its intent to levy, the taxpayer has thirty days \nto request a hearing.  \u00a7 6330(a)(3)(B).  That hearing, \nknown as a Collection Due Process (\u201cCDP\u201d) hearing, is \n\u201can administrative proceeding before an appeals officer \nwith the [IRS Office of Appeals] in which a taxpayer may \nraise \u2018any relevant issue relating to the unpaid tax or the \nproposed levy.\u2019\u200a\u201d  United States v. Weiss, 52 F.4th 546, \n548 (3d Cir. 2022) (quoting \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A)).  Under  \n\u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B), the taxpayer \nmay also raise at the [CDP] hearing challenges to the \nexistence or amount of [his or her] underlying tax li-\nability for any tax period if [he or she] did not receive \nany statutory notice of deficiency for such tax liabil-\nity or did not otherwise have an opportunity to dis-\npute such tax liability. \nThis scheme makes good sense in light of potential \ndue process concerns.  \u201c[S]ome form of hearing is re-\nquired before an individual is finally deprived of a prop-\nerty interest[,]\u201d Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 333 \n(1976), and a taxpayer who cannot challenge a levy  \nbefore seizure and sale may wrongfully lose property \nwithout notice or the opportunity to be heard, see  \n\u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A).  Similarly, and particularly relevant \nhere, a taxpayer who cannot challenge her underlying \nliability before collection may wrongfully lose money \nwithout notice or a hearing.  \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B); see gener-\nally S. Rep. No. 105-174, at 67 (1998) (\u201c[T]he IRS should \nafford taxpayers adequate notice of collection activity \n\n5a \n \nand a meaningful hearing before the IRS deprives them \nof their property.\u201d). \nSo, to recap:  If the taxpayer could have commenced \na deficiency proceeding before the CDP hearing, the \nhearing provides a forum to challenge the unpaid tax \nand proposed levy only.  But if the taxpayer had no op-\nportunity to commence a deficiency proceeding, the CDP \nhearing provides a forum to challenge the unpaid tax, \nthe proposed levy, and the underlying tax liability. \nOnce the IRS Office of Appeals makes a determina-\ntion on the taxpayer\u2019s challenges, the taxpayer has thirty \ndays to petition the Tax Court to review any issues that \nwere properly raised at the CDP hearing.  \u00a7 6330(d)(1).  \nAgain, the Tax Court\u2019s final order is subject to review \nby an Article III court.  \u00a7 7482(a)(1). \n3.  Unpaid Tax Versus Tax Liability \nSection 6330(c)(2)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code \nraises an important question:  What is the difference \nbetween unpaid tax and tax liability?  There must be \nsome distinction, or else the language in \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B) \nallowing a challenge to liability would be superfluous.5  \nCongress confined the right to raise a liability challenge \nto taxpayers who did not have a previous opportunity to \ndo so, while at the same time granting all taxpayers in a \nCDP hearing the ability to raise issues relating to the \nunpaid tax or proposed levy.  Hence, it is evident that \nCongress intended to grant to qualifying taxpayers \n \n5  Section 6330(c)(2)(A) authorizes a taxpayer to raise \u201cany rele-\nvant issue relating to the unpaid tax or the proposed levy,\u201d while  \n\u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B) grants qualifying taxpayers an opportunity to raise \n\u201cchallenges to the existence or amount of the underlying tax liabil-\nity.\u201d \n\n6a \n \nsome right in addition to the rights given to all taxpay-\ners in a CDP hearing.  See infra section II.C.3.  On \nthat basis, \u201cunpaid tax\u201d cannot be synonymous with \u201ctax \nliability.\u201d  See also United States v. Yung, 37 F.4th 70, \n79 (3d Cir. 2022) (\u201cNormally, where Congress uses dif-\nferent words, we read those words to have different \nmeanings.\u201d). \nThere is indeed a distinction:  West\u2019s Tax Law Dic-\ntionary defines \u201ctax liability\u201d as the \u201c[t]otal amount of \ntax owed to the I.R.S. after the allowance of any proper \ncredits.\u201d  Tax Liability, West\u2019s Tax Law Dictionary  \n\u00a7 T830 (emphasis added).  And it defines credit as \u201can \nallowance against the tax itself [including] [i]ncome tax \nwithheld on wages, prepaid estimated taxes, [etc.]\u201d \nCredit, West\u2019s Tax Law Dictionary \u00a7 C4530 (emphasis \nadded).  Tax liability is therefore the net amount owed \nto the IRS:  If you owe $20 to the IRS and have prepaid \nthat $20, your tax liability\u2014at least on these simple facts \n\u2014is $0.  Understanding \u201ctax liability\u201d in this way ac-\ncords with the plain meaning of \u201cliability.\u201d  To say, \u201cI \nhave no liability\u201d is to say, in effect, \u201cI owe nothing.\u201d  A \n\u201cchallenge\u201d to liability under \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B) means the \ntaxpayer disputes what the IRS says he owes. \nIn contrast, \u201cissue[s] relating to the unpaid tax\u201d un-\nder \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A) do not directly concern the amount \nand existence of the liability.  Instead, such issues con-\ncern the IRS\u2019s proposed collection activity, as illus-\ntrated by the three examples Congress provides in the \nstatute:  \u201c(i) appropriate spousal defenses [for a spouse \nwho filed a joint tax return]; (ii) challenges to the appro-\npriateness of collection actions; and (iii) offers of collec-\ntion alternatives.\u201d  \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A).  In each case, the \nfocus is not on the liability itself, but is rather on the \n\n7a \n \nmethod the IRS will use to collect what it says is due to \nthe government.  See Treas. Reg. \u00a7 301.6330-1(e)(3), \nQ&A (E)(3) (2006) (\u201cWhen a taxpayer asserts a spousal \ndefense, the taxpayer is not disputing the amount or ex-\nistence of the liability itself\u200a[.]\u201d). \nStrictly speaking, then, unpaid tax means something \ndifferent than tax liability.  For example, assuming \nthat the IRS has assessed $20 in taxes, your unpaid tax \nis just that:  the $20 the IRS says you owe.  But fur-\nther proceedings can change that number.  If a defi-\nciency proceeding or a challenge under \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B) \nin a CDP hearing establishes that the IRS should have \ncredited $5 toward the $20 balance, your liability is $15, \nand, once fixed by those further proceedings, that sum \nalso becomes your unpaid tax. \nB. \nFactual Background6 \nZuch and Patrick Gennardo7 were married from 1993 \nto 2014.  On September 12, 2012, they filed separate, \nuntimely tax returns for the 2010 tax year, each electing \nmarried-filing-separately status. 8  Zuch\u2019s tax return \n \n6  Unless otherwise noted, the facts are undisputed.  They are \ntaken primarily from the stipulated factual record submitted to the \nTax Court. \n7  Gennardo is not a party in this proceeding. \n8  A taxpayer must elect one of several filing statuses when sub-\nmitting an individual income tax return.  See IRS, 1040 (and 1040-\nSR): Instructions 13 (2023), https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1040gi. \npdf [https://perma.cc/X76A-GVKC].  Unmarried taxpayers who \ndo not have a qualifying dependent must elect \u201cSingle\u201d status.  Id.  \nUnmarried taxpayers who have a qualifying dependent may elect \n\u201cHead of Household\u201d status.  Id. at 14-15.  Married taxpayers have \nthe option to elect either \u201cMarried Filing Jointly\u201d or \u201cMarried Fil-\ning Separately\u201d status.  Id. at 13-14.  Unmarried persons whose \n \n\n8a \n \nshowed adjusted gross income of $74,493 and an over-\npayment of tax of $731.9  Gennardo\u2019s tax return showed \nadjusted gross income of $1,077,213 and tax due of \n$385,393.  On that same day, Gennardo filed an offer-\nin-compromise to settle his tax debts for the 2007 to 2011 \ntax years.10 \nAll of this had been preceded in 2010 and 2011 by two \nprepayments of the couple\u2019s estimated tax liability for \n2010.  More specifically, in June of 2010, the couple \nsubmitted an estimated tax payment of $20,000 to the \nIRS for the 2010 tax year.11  Gennardo then, in January \nof 2011, sent an estimated tax payment of $30,000 for the \n2010 tax year.12  When they made the payments, Zuch \nand Gennardo did not specify how they wanted to have \nthe IRS allocate those payments to their respective tax \nliabilities, and Zuch\u2019s late-filed 2010 tax return did not \nmention the estimated payments.  After processing \nGennardo\u2019s return, the IRS sent him a notice, in October \nof 2012, that showed it had applied the full $50,000 in \nestimated payments to offset the tax due on his individ-\nual 2010 return. \n \nspouse died during the previous two tax years and who have a qual-\nifying dependent may elect \u201cQualifying Surviving Spouse\u201d status.  \nId. at 15. \n9  The IRS applied that overpayment to the couple\u2019s 2008 unpaid \ntax liability. \n10 An offer-in-compromise allows a taxpayer to settle tax debts for \nless than the total amount of the outstanding liability.  \u00a7 7122(a). \n11 The check was drawn from a bank account that listed both \nZuch\u2019s and Gennardo\u2019s names.  The accompanying Form 1040-ES \nalso listed both of their names. \n12 The check Gennardo used to make the payment listed only his \nname.  The cover letter accompanying the check, however, listed \nboth Zuch\u2019s and Gennardo\u2019s names. \n\n9a \n \nLater, in November of 2012, Zuch filed an amended \n2010 tax return to report additional income of $71,000 \nfrom a retirement account distribution, causing addi-\ntional tax due of $27,682.  On that return, she claimed \nthe benefit of the same $50,000 in estimated payments \nand requested a refund of $21,918.  The IRS assessed \nZuch the additional tax she reported, but it did not re-\nfund or otherwise credit her for the $50,000 in estimated \npayments that she claimed.  It also allegedly sent her \na notice and demand for payment of her additional tax \ndue, but she disputes ever having been sent such a no-\ntice.13 \nSoon after, in March of 2013, Gennardo filed an \namended tax return for the 2010 tax year.  He included \na statement that he was amending his return in part to \nnotify the IRS that there were estimated payments of \n$50,000 that should be allocated to Zuch,14 apparently \nshowing his approval of Zuch\u2019s previously filed amended \n \n13 Before the Tax Court, the IRS and Zuch jointly stipulated that \nthe IRS had sent her a notice of tax due and demand for payment.  \nIn her briefing, Zuch now asserts that the IRS never notified her.  \nA notice of tax due and demand for payment is not to be confused \nwith a notice of deficiency; the IRS uses the former to notify the \ntaxpayer of an unpaid tax and to demand payment, Notice CP14, \nTaxpayer Advoc. Serv. (updated July 11, 2023), https://www. \ntaxpayeradvocate.irs.gov/notices/notice-cp14/[https://perma.cc/H92Z-\nM9QM], while the IRS uses the latter to notify a taxpayer that it is \nproposing to increase the total amount of tax due for a particular \ntax year, 90 Day Notice of Deficiency, Taxpayer Advoc. Serv. (up-\ndated Dec. 6, 2023), https://www.taxpayeradvocate.irs.gov/notices/ \nexam-90-day-notice-of-deficiency/ [https://perma.cc/VZX2-84JZ].  \nIt is undisputed that Zuch never received a notice of deficiency. \n14 Gennardo did not mention on his tax return that the IRS had al-\nready allocated the $50,000 in estimated payments to him or that he \nhad an offer-in-compromise pending. \n\n10a \n \nreturn in which she claimed the benefit of the estimated \npayments.15  But the IRS did not adjust the allocation \nof the $50,000 from Gennardo to Zuch.  In June of 2013, \nGennardo submitted an amended offer-in-compromise \nto increase the amount of his offer, which the IRS ac-\ncepted the next month.  Despite his earlier direction \nthat the estimated payments should be allocated to \nZuch, the IRS gave him a document showing it had cred-\nited the $50,000 in estimated payments to his outstand-\ning tax liability. \nC. \nProcedural Background \n \n1. \nZuch\u2019s CDP Hearing \nOn August 31, 2013, the IRS sent Zuch a \u201cFinal No-\ntice of Intent to Levy and Notice of your Right to a \nHearing.\u201d  (App. at 563.)  That notice informed her \nthat the IRS intended to levy on her property for failing \nto pay her remaining 2010 tax liability of approximately \n$36,000 and that she had thirty days to appeal the levy \nby requesting a CDP hearing with the IRS Office of Ap-\npeals.  Zuch timely requested a CDP hearing, and be-\ncause she did not receive a notice of deficiency or \u201coth-\nerwise have an opportunity to dispute [her] tax liabil-\nity,\u201d she exercised her right to challenge \u201cthe existence \nor amount of the underlying tax liability\u201d in the CDP \nproceedings.  \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B).  Specifically, Zuch al-\nleged that the $50,000 of estimated tax payments cred-\nited to Gennardo should have been credited to her, mak-\ning her underlying tax liability $0.16  Prior to the hear-\n \n15 Zuch\u2019s and Gennardo\u2019s amended tax returns were prepared by \nthe same tax preparer. \n16 Zuch also requested that the IRS abate any underpayment pen-\nalties against her because she was going through a divorce with Gen-\n \n\n11a \n \ning, Zuch\u2019s counsel submitted a signed declaration from \nGennardo directing the IRS to apply the $50,000 to \nZuch\u2019s personal tax liability.17 \nThe CDP hearing was held via telephone on July 29, \n2014.  During the hearing, an IRS officer told Zuch\u2019s \ncounsel that he did not believe that the IRS could credit \nany of the estimated payments to Zuch\u2019s liability because \nthey had already been credited to Gennardo\u2019s account, \nwhich had been subject to an offer-in-compromise.  On \nSeptember 25, 2014, the IRS Office of Appeals sent Zuch \na Notice of Determination sustaining the IRS\u2019s pro-\nposed levy and stating it was \u201cnot in a position\u201d to move \ncredits from Gennardo\u2019s account to hers.  (App. at 294.)  \nThat notice also informed Zuch that she had thirty days \nto dispute the IRS\u2019s determination by filing a petition \nwith the Tax Court. \n \n2. \nZuch\u2019s Tax Court Proceedings \nZuch did petition the Tax Court for relief.  She \nasked the Court to conduct a de novo review of her un-\nderlying tax liability and conclude that the $50,000 in es-\ntimated tax payments should be applied to her individ-\nual account.  The IRS moved for summary judgment, \nwhich the Tax Court denied in December 2016.  It \nmade three observations at that time.  First, it stated \nthat the initial $20,000 estimated payment appeared to \nbe a joint estimated tax payment and that it was unclear \nwhy the IRS had applied the payment to Mr. Gennardo\u2019s \n \nnardo and collection would create an undue hardship for her.  The \nIRS denied that request. \n17 The IRS notes in its briefing that the declaration was signed in \nMarch 2014, nearly eight months after Gennardo had received \ncredit for the estimated payments pursuant to his amended offer-\nin-compromise. \n\n12a \n \ntax liabilities.  Second, the Court explained that it was \n\u201cunclear whether the [later] $30,000 payment was a sep-\narate payment or a joint payment.\u201d  (App. at 264.)  \nAnd third, it noted that the \u201ccircumstances surrounding \nMr. Gennardo\u2019s [offer-in-compromise were] not clear[,]\u201d \nincluding whether that offer-in-compromise satisfied \nZuch and Gennardo\u2019s joint tax liabilities for any years \nthey filed a joint tax return and, if so, whether Zuch was \ninvolved in the offer-in-compromise process.  (App. at \n264.) \nThe Tax Court then granted the IRS\u2019s unopposed \nmotion to remand the case to the IRS Office of Appeals.  \nIn June 2017, the IRS issued a Supplemental Notice of \nDetermination, confirming its prior determination to \nsustain the levy and stating that it received no new in-\nformation that would compel it to change its prior deci-\nsion.  The case returned to the Tax Court and was ini-\ntially set for trial.  Instead, the parties agreed to forgo \ntrial and proceed on a stipulated factual record.18 \n \n3. \nCredit Setoffs \nThroughout the several years Zuch was arguing with \nthe IRS about her 2010 tax liability, including in the \nCDP hearing and in the Tax Court, the IRS was taking \ntax refunds that Zuch was owed in later tax years and \napplying them to what it calculated to be her 2010 tax \nliability.  It did this six times\u2014once each in 2013, 2014, \n \n18 Tax Court Rule 122(a) provides, \u201cAny case not requiring a trial \nfor the submission of evidence (as, for example, where sufficient \nfacts have been admitted [or] stipulated  . . . )  may be submitted  \n. . .  by motion of the parties filed with the Court.\u201d \n\n13a \n \n2015, and 2019, and twice in 2016.19  On April 15, 2019, \nthe IRS used a refund to set off the remainder of Zuch\u2019s \n2010 unpaid tax, reducing the balance due to $0. \nWith no remaining unpaid tax on which to execute a \nlevy, the IRS moved to dismiss the Tax Court proceed-\ning as moot.  Zuch opposed the motion, but the Tax \nCourt granted it and dismissed the petition.  In a short \norder, the Court held that the case was moot.  Without \nacknowledging \u00a7 6330(c)(2)\u2019s distinction between unpaid \ntax and underlying tax liability, the Court found there \nwas no longer a live controversy because there was \u201cno \nunpaid liability  . . .  upon which a levy could be \nbased\u201d and the IRS was \u201cno longer pursuing the pro-\nposed collection action[.]\u201d  (App. at 7-8.)  It also ex-\nplained that the Tax Court was not the proper forum to \ndetermine whether Zuch had overpaid because it lacked \n\u201cjurisdiction to determine an overpayment or to order a \nrefund or credit of tax paid in a [CDP] proceeding[.]\u201d  \n(App. at 7.) \nZuch timely appealed the Tax Court\u2019s order. \nII. DISCUSSION20 \nThe dispute comes down to this:  whether, in the \nmidst of litigation over a contested tax liability, the IRS \n \n19 In its briefing and at oral argument, the IRS alleged that Zuch \nshould have received notice of the setoffs.  But it provided no evi-\ndentiary support that notice was sent to her. \n20 The Tax Court had jurisdiction under \u00a7\u00a7 6330(d)(1) and 7442.  \nWe have jurisdiction pursuant to \u00a7 7482(a)(1).  We exercise \u201cde novo \nreview over the Tax Court\u2019s findings of law, including its construc-\ntion and application of the Internal Revenue Code.\u201d  DeNaples v. \nComm\u2019r, 674 F.3d 172, 176 (3d Cir. 2012).  We review factual find-\nings for clear error.  Id. \n\n14a \n \nis free to deprive the Tax Court of jurisdiction by the \nexpedient of taking the taxpayer\u2019s tax refunds and ap-\nplying them to that liability.  The answer is no.  The \nIRS\u2019s arrogation to itself of the power to eliminate pre-\ndeprivation judicial review of liability by seizing a tax-\npayer\u2019s money to cover a disputed debt is not supported \nby relevant statute, common law (incorporated into stat-\nute), or mootness principles. \nA. \nThe Tax Court Originally Had Jurisdiction to \nHear Zuch\u2019s Claim. \nThe Tax Court is a tribunal of limited jurisdiction.  \nSunoco, 663 F.3d at 187.  Being organized under Arti-\ncle I of the Constitution, it possesses only the power \u201cex-\npressly conferred by Congress.\u201d  Id.  Congress has \ngranted the Tax Court jurisdiction to review decisions \nmade by the IRS Office of Appeals in CDP hearings.   \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1).  Specifically, the Tax Court is to consider \n\u201cany relevant issue [raised by the taxpayer] relating to \nthe unpaid tax or the proposed levy[.]\u201d  \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A).  \nIf the taxpayer \u201cdid not receive any statutory notice of \ndeficiency for [his or her] tax liability or did not other-\nwise have an opportunity to dispute such tax liability[,]\u201d \nthe Court must, in addition, consider any challenge \u201cto \nthe existence or amount of the underlying tax liabil-\nity[.]\u201d  \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B). \nZuch fell into the latter category, disputing her 2010 \ntax liability at the CDP hearing by arguing that the \n$50,000 provided by her and Gennardo as estimated tax \npayments should have been applied to satisfy her tax li-\nability instead of Gennardo\u2019s.  Because Zuch had nei-\nther received a notice of deficiency nor had an oppor-\ntunity to contest the allocation of the tax payments prior \n\n15a \n \nto her CDP hearing,21 the IRS was required to consider \nher challenge.  The IRS did so, finding that the $50,000 \ncould not be credited to Zuch and sustaining the levy.  \nAccordingly, the Tax Court had jurisdiction to review \nthat determination, including whether the estimated \npayments were allocated correctly.22 \nB. \nThe Tax Court Applies Article III Case or Contro-\nversy Principles to Determine Mootness. \n\u201cArticle III of the Constitution restricts the power of \nfederal courts to \u2018Cases\u2019 and \u2018Controversies.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Chafin \nv. Chafin, 568 U.S. 165, 171 (2013).  As an Article I tri-\nbunal, however, the Tax Court \u201cis not fully constrained \nby Article III\u2019s case or controversy limitation.\u201d  Bar-\nanowicz v. Comm\u2019r, 432 F.3d 972, 975 (9th Cir. 2005).  \nNevertheless, the Tax Court wisely applies that con-\nstraint to itself, Battat v. Comm\u2019r, 148 T.C. 32, 46 (2017) \n(\u201cThe case or controversy requirement under Article III \npresumptively applies in the Tax Court.\u201d), and, of course, \nis free to do so for prudential reasons, cf. Zevalkink v. \nBrown, 102 F.3d 1236, 1243 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (\u201cAs a court \nestablished under Article I of the U.S. Constitution, the \nCourt of Veterans Appeals  . . .  has decided, based \non the same prudential considerations behind the \u2018case \nor controversy\u2019 requirement,  . . .  that it would re-\n \n21 Zuch did not receive a notice of deficiency because the amount \nof tax due that she reported, without taking any payments into ac-\ncount, is not in dispute.  See supra note 13. \n22 The IRS does not dispute that the Tax Court originally had ju-\nrisdiction to review the proper allocation of the estimated tax pay-\nments.  (Supp. Br. at 15 (\u201cIf Zuch\u2019s tax liability for 2010 had not \nbeen fully satisfied by the credit offsets, we agree that the case \nwould not be moot and that the Tax Court could review the proper \nallocation of the estimated tax payments.\u201d).) \n\n16a \n \nfrain from deciding cases that do not present an actual \ncase or controversy.\u201d).  Zuch and the IRS agree that \nthe Tax Court need not hear a moot case.  Accordingly, \nfor purposes of this matter, we discuss and apply Article \nIII mootness principles to determine whether Zuch\u2019s \nclaim is moot. \nArticle III permits federal courts to \u201centertain ac-\ntions only if [those actions] present live disputes, ones in \nwhich both sides have a personal stake.\u201d  Hartnett v. \nPa. State Educ. Ass\u2019n, 963 F.3d 301, 305 (3d Cir. 2020).  \nThat \u201ccase or controversy\u201d requirement remains \u201cthrough \nall stages of federal judicial proceedings, trial and ap-\npellate.\u201d  Chafin, 568 U.S. at 172 (internal quotation \nmarks omitted).  Thus, a case becomes moot, and a fed-\neral court is deprived of jurisdiction to hear that case, \nwhen there is no longer a live case or controversy be-\ntween the litigants.  Id.  \u201cAs long as the parties have \na concrete interest, however small, in the outcome of the \nlitigation, the case is not moot.\u201d  Id. (internal quotation \nmarks omitted).  Therefore, a case \u201cbecomes moot only \nwhen it is impossible for a court to grant any effectual \nrelief whatever to the prevailing party.\u201d  Knox v. Serv. \nEmps. Int\u2019l Union, Loc. 1000, 567 U.S. 298, 307 (2012) \n(cleaned up).  A defendant faces a \u201cheavy burden\u201d \nwhen trying to persuade a court that there is no longer \na live controversy.  Hartnett, 963 F.3d at 305-06 (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted). \nC. \nZuch\u2019s Claim Is Not Moot. \nThe parties dispute whether Zuch\u2019s claim falls under \n\u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A) or \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B).  We therefore first \naddress how Zuch\u2019s claim should be characterized, be-\nfore turning to the question of mootness. \n\n17a \n \n \n1. The Characterization of Zuch\u2019s Claim. \nIn the Notice of Determination that Zuch received, \nthe IRS listed her challenge to the allocation of the esti-\nmated payments under the heading \u201cChallenges to the \nLiability.\u201d  (App. at 298.)  Now, however, it argues \nthat a challenge to the allocation of estimated tax pay-\nments is not a challenge to the \u201cunderlying liability,\u201d \nwhich involves \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B), but is rather a challenge \n\u201crelating to the unpaid tax\u201d under \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A). 23  \nSee supra section I.A.3.  It says that Zuch\u2019s claim \nshould be understood not as involving the net amount \nshe owes to the IRS, but rather the amount of tax she \nself-reported on her amended return, separate from any \npayments she reported or paid to satisfy that tax.  \nThus, the IRS asserts that once there is no levy and no \nunpaid tax, the challenge to the proper allocation of the \npayments is extinguished because Zuch\u2019s underlying tax \nliability, as the IRS defines it, is not disputed. \nThis is, to be frank, nothing but self-serving word \nplay.  The IRS says an \u201cunderlying tax liability\u201d must \nbe understood by looking only at the \u201ctotal tax\u201d line on \na return, while turning a blind eye to estimated tax pay-\nments listed on the very same return.  But Zuch\u2019s \u201ctax \nliability\u201d did not exist in a vacuum, separate from pay-\n \n23 See also I.R.S. Notice CC-2014-002 (May 5, 2014), 2014 WL \n2003048 (explaining the IRS\u2019s view that a challenge to whether the \nIRS properly applied a payment is a challenge to the unpaid tax \nunder \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A), subject to abuse-of-discretion review, rather \nthan a challenge to the underlying tax liability under \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B), \nsubject to de novo review). \n\n18a \n \nments she made on that liability.24  She would only have \nan underlying liability if the tax was unpaid after she \nfiled her amended return. \nPerhaps because its meaning is clear, the term \u201cun-\nderlying tax liability\u201d is not defined by statute, nor is \nthere any reference to its meaning in the relevant legis-\nlative history.  Montgomery v. Comm\u2019r, 122 T.C. 1, 7 \n(2004).  Yet, the Tax Court has been inconsistent in \ntreating challenges to the IRS\u2019s application of payments \nand credits toward tax as, in some instances, falling  \nunder \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A), and in others as under  \n\u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B).  Compare Landry v.

Conceivably, there could be a collection action \nreview proceeding where  . . .  the proposed collection action \nis not moot and where pursuant to sec. 6330(c)(2)(B), the tax-\npayer is entitled to challenge \u201cthe existence or amount of the un-\nderlying tax liability.\u201d  In such a case, the validity of the pro-\nposed collection action might depend upon whether the taxpayer \nhas any unpaid balance, which might implicate the question of \nwhether the taxpayer has paid more than was owed.   \nGreene-Thapedi v. Comm\u2019r, 126 T.C. 1, 11 n.19 (2006). \n\n19a \n \ncredited a payment is not a challenge to a tax liability; \ni.e., the amount of tax imposed by the Code for a partic-\nular year.  It is instead a question of whether the liabil-\nity remains unpaid.\u201d  (emphases omitted)). \nThe inconsistency is puzzling since it seems obvious \nthat a taxpayer\u2019s \u201cchallenge[] to the existence or amount \nof the underlying tax liability\u201d involves whether and  \nhow much the taxpayer has paid on that liability.   \n\u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B).  A dispute over whether the IRS ap-\npropriately credited a taxpayer\u2019s account with esti-\nmated tax payments is, at bottom, a dispute over the tax-\npayer\u2019s underlying tax liability.  The point is one of \nplain English.  Therefore, Zuch\u2019s argument that her \nestimated tax payments were erroneously allocated to \nher ex-husband is a challenge to her underlying tax lia-\nbility under \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B). \nNonetheless, even if the IRS is correct that Zuch\u2019s \nclaim is properly characterized as a challenge to unpaid \ntax under \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A), the IRS still loses. \n \n2.  Zuch\u2019s Claim Is Not Moot Because the IRS\u2019s \nSetoffs Were Invalid. \nBecause, as explained below, the Tax Court retains \njurisdiction to review setoffs, and the IRS cannot satisfy \na tax dispute by means of unlawful credit setoffs, Zuch\u2019s \ntax obligation was not properly set off, and she can chal-\nlenge the IRS\u2019s application of the estimated payments.25 \n \n25 As noted previously, the IRS does not dispute that the Tax Court \nhad jurisdiction to hear Zuch\u2019s claim regarding the estimated tax \npayments at issue prior to the IRS\u2019s credit setoffs, see supra note \n22, albeit under \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A). \n\n20a \n \n \na) The Tax Court has jurisdiction to review \nsetoffs. \nUnder \u00a7 6402(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, the \nIRS normally must refund to taxpayers any tax pay-\nments in excess of their liability for that taxable year.  \nBut \u00a7 6402(a) allows the IRS to apply any refund amount \nas a setoff against a taxpayer\u2019s unpaid tax debts, thus \nlowering or eliminating the amount of the refund. \nThe IRS contends that, in \u00a7 6512(b)(4), Congress af-\nfirmatively stripped the Tax Court of its jurisdiction to \nreview setoffs.  That provision says the \u201cTax Court \nshall have no jurisdiction under this subsection to re-\nstrain or review any credit or reduction made by the \nSecretary under section 6402.\u201d  \u00a7 6512(b)(4) (emphasis \nadded).  But, by its terms, subsection 6512(b) is limited \nto describing the Tax Court\u2019s overpayment and refund \njurisdiction in a deficiency proceeding.  See supra Sec-\ntion I.A.1.  It does not refer to CDP proceedings, so \nthat jurisdiction stripping provision is plainly inapplica-\nble.  It does not affect Zuch\u2019s case.26 \nThe IRS also asserts that Congress did not affirma-\ntively grant the Tax Court the power to review setoffs in \na CDP case.  It may be that Congress has not explicitly \ngranted the Tax Court such power, but an implicit grant \nallows the Court to review setoffs in any event. \nAs the Tax Court has recognized, \u201c[s]ection 6402(a) \ncontains a statutory counterpart\u201d to the common law \n \n26 In its opening brief and at oral argument, the IRS argued that  \n\u00a7 6402(g) also barred judicial review of tax setoffs under \u00a7 6402 \u201cin \nthe Tax Court or anywhere else.\u201d  (Answering Br. at 22; Oral Arg. \nTrans. at 85-87.)  It retreated from that position in its supplemental \nbriefing. \n\n21a \n \nright of offset.  Boyd v. Comm\u2019r, 124 T.C. 296, 300 \n(2005).  And the common law of setoffs \u201ccalls for judi-\ncial review of the merits of the claim being invoked as an \noffset of a government debt.\u201d  Agility Pub. Warehous-\ning Co. K.S.C.P. v. United States, 969 F.3d 1355, 1365 \n(Fed. Cir. 2020).  For example, the Federal Circuit has \n\u201cemphasized that the Debt Collection Act [of 1982, Pub. \nL. No. 97-365, 96 Stat. 1749,27] was intended to supple-\nment, and not displace, the government\u2019s pre-existing \noffset rights under the common law.\u201d  McCall Stock \nFarms, Inc. v. United States, 14 F.3d 1562, 1566 (Fed. \nCir. 1993).  \u201cCongress understood that to trigger the \n[Debt Collection Act\u2019s] offset provision, a pre-existing, \nvalid debt must first be owed to the United States.\u201d  \nAgility, 969 F.3d at 1364.  Accordingly, the court rea-\nsoned that the Act \u201ccannot be reasonably interpreted as \nshielding from judicial review the United States\u2019 deter-\nmination that a pre-[existing] debt is owed.\u201d  Id. \nBecause \u00a7 6402 carries forward the common law of \nsetoffs, and because that section says nothing about dis-\nallowing Tax Court offset review (as Congress has ex-\npressly and specifically stated elsewhere in the Tax \nCode), it follows that the Court has the power to review \nsetoffs in a CDP proceeding to determine whether there \nwas a pre-existing, valid debt that was owed to the IRS. \n \n \n \n27 Akin to \u00a7 6402(a), the Debt Collection Act provides, in relevant \npart, that the government may collect an outstanding debt owed to \nthe United States \u201cby [means of\u200a] administrative offset,\u201d 31 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 3716(a), which means to \u201cwithhold[] funds payable by the United \nStates  . . .  to  . . .  a person to satisfy\u201d a debt that the per-\nson owes the government, id. \u00a7 3701(a)(1). \n\n22a \n \n \nb) The IRS setoffs violated setoff common \nlaw and Article III mootness principles \nand are thus invalid. \nThe \u201cright of setoff (also called \u2018offset\u2019) allows [par-\nties] that owe each other money to apply their mutual \ndebts against each other, thereby avoiding \u2018the absurd-\nity of making A pay B when B owes A.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Citizens Bank \nof Md. v. Strumpf, 516 U.S. 16, 18 (1995) (quoting \nStudley v. Boylston Nat\u2019l Bank of Bos., 229 U.S. 523, 528 \n(1913)).  The right to apply mutual debts to offset each \nother does not apply when the debts are disputed.  Ac-\ncordingly, a creditor cannot set off a disputed debt with \nan undisputed one.  That is a matter of black letter law.  \nSetoff, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019) (\u201cSet off \nis a mode of defence by which the defendant acknowl-\nedges the justice of the plaintiff\u200a\u2019s demand, but sets up a \ndemand of his own against the plaintiff, to counter- \nbalance it either in whole or in part.\u201d  (emphasis added) \n(quoting Oliver L.

As the \nSeventh Circuit has noted: \nCourts regularly require the payment of undisputed \ndebts while the parties litigate their genuine dis-\nputes.  This reflects the limits of the common law \nright of set-off between debts.  Setoffs are permit-\nted only when the debts are \u201cmutual\u201d, and debts aris-\ning at different times out of different circumstances \nare not mutual. \n\n23a \n \nSoo Line R.R. Co. v. Escanaba & Lake Superior R.R. \nCo., 840 F.2d 546, 551 (7th Cir. 1988) (internal citation \nomitted) (Easterbrook, J.). \nTo the extent that the IRS\u2019s argument is that  \n\u00a7 6402(a) rescinds the common law governing setoffs, \nthe answer is no, it does not.  Nowhere in the text is \nthere any indication of that, and even the IRS did not \nseem to think it so until the middle of this appeal.  It \nexplained in its initial brief that \u00a7 6402(a) \u201cis a tax- \nspecific codification of the common-law right of setoff\u200a[.]\u201d  \n(Answering Br. at 21.)  Perhaps, as a result of being \npressed on that issue at oral argument, the IRS now pro-\nfesses a different view\u2014that \u201csetoffs authorized by  \n\u00a7 6402(a) do not need to follow any common-law princi-\nples regarding setoffs[.]\u201d  (Supp. Br. at 13.)  The change \nin position may be convenient but it is ill-considered and \nunpersuasive. \nA \u201clongstanding [rule] is  . . .  that statutes which \ninvade the common law are to be read with a presumption \nfavoring the retention of long-established and familiar \nprinciples, except when a statutory purpose to the con-\ntrary is evident.\u201d28  United States v. Texas, 507 U.S. 529, \n534 (1993) (cleaned up).  And to \u201cabrogate a common-\n \n28 Although it is not essential to our holding, nothing in the legisla-\ntive history of \u00a7 6402(a) suggests that its purpose was to overrule the \ncommon law.  Section 252 of the Revenue Act of 1918 appears to be \nthe earliest forerunner of the setoff provision that is now in \u00a7 6402(a), \nand only a single sentence, buried in a House Ways and Means Com-\nmittee Report for that old act, suggests the purpose for the provi-\nsion:  \u201cIt is believed that this provision will materially assist in the \nsettlement of transactions between the taxpayer and the Govern-\nment.\u201d  H.R. Rep. No. 65-767, at 15 (1918).  If anything, allowing \nthe government to set off disputed debts hinders, rather than as-\nsists, settlements, as this case demonstrates. \n\n24a \n \nlaw principle, the statute must speak directly to the ques-\ntion addressed by the common law.\u201d  Id. (internal quo-\ntation marks omitted).  Section 6402(a) does not do that. \nAlthough \u00a7 6402(a) allows the IRS to credit overpay-\nments to \u201cany liability\u201d of the taxpayer, reading that \nprovision to allow a disputed debt to be set off has the \ninfirmity of presupposing that the taxpayer in fact has \nsome liability.  In other words, the reading that the \nIRS pushes is an exercise in pure bootstrapping.  Zuch \nalleges that she does not have any liability, and it does \nnothing to advance the analysis of this case for the IRS \nto simply declare that she does and then say it is accord-\ningly allowed to effect a setoff.  The law is exactly to \nthe contrary.  The whole point of Congress\u2019s authoriza-\ntion of CDP hearings is to give taxpayers \u201cprotections \nin dealing with the IRS that are similar to those they \nwould have in dealing with any other creditor.\u201d  S. Rep. \nNo. 105-174, at 67.  Allowing offsets such as the ones \nhere would be an affront to the entire purpose of CDP \nhearings.  We instead \u201ctake it as given that Congress \nhas legislated with an expectation that the [common law] \nprinciple[s] [of setoff\u200a] will apply[.]\u201d 29   Astoria Fed. \nSav. & Loan Ass\u2019n v. Solimino, 501 U.S. 104, 108 (1991) \n(cleaned up). \n \n29 Treas. Reg. \u00a7 301.6330-1(g)(2), Q&A (G)(3) (2006) provides that \nthe IRS may offset overpayments against the unpaid tax in a CDP \nproceeding during the pendency of the CDP hearing and appeals \nprocess.  To the extent that regulation provides that the IRS can \ntake an undisputed debt (i.e., an overpayment of taxes, giving rise to \nan obligation by the government to provide a refund) and apply it \nagainst a disputed one (like the alleged tax liability here), such an \ninterpretation of the statute is untenable.  Nothing in the plain text \nof \u00a7 6402(a) allows for such a meaning. \n\n25a \n \nBeyond violating the common law and the clear leg-\nislative intent to preserve taxpayer rights in CDP hear-\nings, the setoffs here violate Article III mootness prin-\nciples.  \u201cOne scenario in which we are reluctant to de-\nclare a case moot is when the defendant argues moot-\nness because of some action it took unilaterally after  \nthe litigation began.\u201d  Hartnett, 963 F.3d at 306; see \nalso Vigon v. Comm\u2019r, 149 T.C. 97, 104 n.3 (2017) (the \nIRS \u201cmay not unilaterally oust the Tax Court from  \njurisdiction\u2014neither in a deficiency case nor in a CDP \ncase\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  That is \nwhat we are faced with here.  It is well established that \n\u201ca defendant\u2019s voluntary cessation of a challenged prac-\ntice does not deprive [us] of [our] power to determine \nthe legality of the practice.\u201d  Friends of the Earth, Inc. \nv. Laidlaw Env\u2019t Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 189 \n(2000) (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis \nadded).  It is no stretch to likewise conclude that, as a \ngeneral matter, and when an avenue of relief remains, a \ndefendant cannot unilaterally complete a challenged \npractice to moot a case either. \nIn short, because the IRS\u2019s setoffs were invalid and \nwithout legal effect, Zuch\u2019s claims are not moot,  \nalthough Zuch\u2019s money is, at least for the time being, in \nthe government\u2019s pocket. \n \n3. Zuch\u2019s Claim Is Also Live Under \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B) \nBecause the Tax Court Retained Jurisdiction \nto Review Her Liability. \nIf we view Zuch\u2019s claim as a challenge to liability un-\nder \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B), we reach the same conclusion. \nZuch\u2019s underlying tax liability was very much in dispute \nwhen the IRS withdrew its levy because it had already \ntaken her money without her consent, and it remained a \n\n26a \n \nlive issue based on (1) a plain reading of the statute,  \n(2) properly read (and non-erroneous) Tax Court prece-\ndent, (3) the Tax Court\u2019s independent jurisdiction over \nliability, (4) the Tax Court\u2019s ability to declare Zuch\u2019s \nrights, and (5) the potential preclusive effect of such a \ndeclaration.  We address each issue in turn.30 \na) Nothing in the plain text of \u00a7 6330 sug-\ngests a taxpayer\u2019s challenge to tax liabil-\nity under \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B) can be rendered \nmoot by the unilateral action of the IRS. \nSection 6330 allows a taxpayer to raise two categories \nof issues at a CDP hearing.  First, \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A) per-\nmits a taxpayer to raise \u201cany relevant issue relating to \nthe unpaid tax or the proposed levy[.]\u201d  Issues under \nthat provision, accordingly, must relate to a tax that is \ncurrently unpaid or a levy that is still being proposed.  \nBut \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B), the provision under which Zuch \nbrought her challenge, permits a taxpayer to \u201calso raise \nat the hearing challenges to the existence or amount of \nthe underlying tax liability  . . .  if the person did not \nreceive any statutory notice of deficiency for such tax \nliability or did not otherwise have an opportunity to dis-\npute such tax liability.\u201d  (emphasis added).  Zuch \nmeets those prerequisites, as the IRS has admitted.  \nUnlike challenges under \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A), the rights pro-\nvided under \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B) are not restricted by any re-\nquirement that they relate to an unpaid tax or proposed \nlevy.  Consequently, there is nothing in \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B) \nto suggest that a taxpayer\u2019s right to challenge the exist-\nence or amount of her underlying tax becomes moot \n \n30 This discussion is only applicable to taxpayers who did not re-\nceive a notice of deficiency or otherwise have a previous opportunity \nto challenge their underlying tax liability. \n\n27a \n \nonce the levy is no longer being enforced or the tax is \nsatisfied. \nWe part ways here with the Fourth and D.C. Circuits.  \nThe Fourth Circuit has held that the phrase \u201cunderlying \ntax liability\u201d in \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B) must be read in the \u201cspe-\ncific context [of\u200a] the IRS\u2019s attempt to collect via lien or \nlevy.\u201d  McLane v. Comm\u2019r, 24 F.4th 316, 319 (4th Cir. \n2022) (internal quotation marks omitted).  With that \nlimitation in mind, it reasoned that the Tax Court does \nnot have jurisdiction \u201cover independent overpayment \nclaims when the collection action no longer exists.\u201d  Id.  \nSimilarly, the D.C. Circuit reasoned that \u201call the relief \nthat section 6330 authorizes the tax court to grant\u201d is \nrelief from levy and that, consequently, there is \u201cno ap-\npropriate course of action for the Tax Court to take but \nto dismiss [a case] as moot\u201d when the IRS withdraws its \nproposed levy.  Willson v. Comm\u2019r, 805 F.3d 316, 321 \n(D.C. Cir. 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted).31 \nWhile it is true that the \u201cplainness or ambiguity of \nstatutory language is determined by reference to  . . .  \nthe specific context in which that language is used, and \nthe broader context of the statute as a whole[,]\u201d Robin-\nson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337, 341 (1997), we do not \nread \u201cunderlying tax liability\u201d so narrowly.  Section \n6330 is not directed toward helping the IRS collect taxes \n \n31 In addition to McLane and Willson, the IRS also relies on \nRuesch v. Commissioner, 805 F. App\u2019x 12, 14 (2d Cir. 2020), to ar-\ngue that a taxpayer can challenge her underlying tax liability only \nwhen the IRS is actively seeking to levy.  But in Ruesch, the issue \nbefore us was never in play.  The Tax Court there held that it \nlacked jurisdiction over the dispute because the IRS had not issued \nthe taxpayer a valid notice of determination, not because of its in-\nterpretation of \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B).  Id. \n\n28a \n \nvia lien or levy.  On the contrary, by its terms it pro-\nvides taxpayers a forum to challenge a lien or levy and \naccounts for different circumstances in which that need \nmay arise\u2014including the circumstance in which the tax-\npayer had no opportunity to challenge her underlying li-\nability. \nAs the Tax Court has explained, the broader purpose \nof \u00a7 6330 in the overall statutory scheme is rather \nstraightforward\u2014to \u201ccollect the correct amount of tax.\u201d  \nMontgomery, 122 T.C. at 10 (emphasis added) (\u201cIn view \nof the statutory scheme as a whole, we think the sub-\nstantive and procedural protections contained in sec-\ntions 6320 and 6330 reflect congressional intent that the \nCommissioner should collect the correct amount of tax, \nand do so by observing all applicable laws and adminis-\ntrative procedures.\u201d); see also S. Rep. No. 105-174, at 67 \n(\u201c[F]ollowing procedures designed to afford taxpayers \ndue process in collections will increase fairness to tax-\npayers.\u201d).  Allowing a taxpayer to challenge her under-\nlying tax liability in a context like the present case, even \nafter the IRS ceases collection, not only comports with \nthe text of \u00a7 6330 but supports that objective.  It also \ncomports with fundamental notions of due process, as \nthe taxpayer in that scenario necessarily has an inde-\npendent right to challenge her tax liability in a CDP \nhearing.32  See supra section I.A.2. \n \n32 If the IRS could impose liability without sending a notice of defi-\nciency, and could both offset the purported liability so as to cease \ncollection and moot any CDP challenge based on its cessation, that \ntaxpayer would be denied any pre-deprivation opportunity to con-\ntest what the IRS says she owes.  Because that taxpayer may not \nbe able to initiate a deficiency proceeding or carry forward her CDP \naction, she also could be denied any Article III forum in which to \n \n\n29a \n \nAfter the IRS Office of Appeals considers the tax-\npayer\u2019s challenges at the CDP hearing and issues its de-\nterminations as to the levy and the taxpayer\u2019s liability, \nthe Tax Court obtains jurisdiction to review those deter-\nminations.  \u00a7 6330(d)(1) (\u201cThe person may  . . .  pe-\ntition the Tax Court for review of such determination \n(and the Tax Court shall have jurisdiction with respect \nto such matter).\u201d  (emphasis added)).  Accordingly, \nthe Tax Court\u2019s \u201cjurisdiction is not limited to the notice \nof [the proposed collection action] that triggered th[e] \ncollection proceeding but rather comprehends all the is-\nsues that Congress allowed to be included in \u2018such mat-\nter.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Vigon, 149 T.C. at 107.  \u201c[S]uch matter\u201d in-\ncludes a challenge to what the IRS asserts to be the un-\nderlying tax liability.33  Id.   \nIn short, there is nothing in the plain text of \u00a7 6330 \nthat suggests a taxpayer\u2019s challenge to the tax liability \nat issue in an action under \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B) can be ren-\ndered moot by the unilateral action of the IRS. \n \nb) Greene-Thapedi\u2019s reasoning was faulty. \nNevertheless, the Tax Court here held otherwise.  \nIt dismissed Zuch\u2019s case as moot \u201c[b]ecause there [was] \nno unpaid liability for the determination year upon \nwhich a levy could be based, and [the IRS was] no longer \npursuing the proposed collection action[.]\u201d  (App. at 7-\n \ncontest her liability.  This is true before collection, and it may also \nbe true as a general matter.  Here, for example, it is not clear \nwhether Zuch would be able to challenge her tax liability at all (out-\nside of a live CDP proceeding) because her post-collection claim \nmight be time-barred.  See infra note 41. \n33 When \u201cthe validity of the underlying tax liability is properly at \nissue, the Court will review the matter on a de novo basis.\u201d  Sego \nv. Comm\u2019r, 114 T.C. 604, 610 (2000). \n\n30a \n \n8.)  That dismissal followed the reasoning of an earlier \ncase called Greene-Thapedi v. Commissioner, 126 T.C. \n1 (2006), with facts very similar to the case before us \nnow.  There, the IRS notified a taxpayer that it in-\ntended to levy on her property to collect a disputed tax \nliability.  Id. at 2-3.  The taxpayer then challenged the \ntax liability in a CDP hearing.  Id. at 3.  The IRS Of-\nfice of Appeals sustained the levy, and the taxpayer pe-\ntitioned the Tax Court for review.  Id.  After she filed \nher petition, the IRS used the taxpayer\u2019s overpayment \nin a later year to fully satisfy the disputed tax liability.  \nId. at 4.  The Tax Court then dismissed the taxpayer\u2019s \nproceeding as moot, holding that \u201cwhatever right peti-\ntioner may have to challenge the existence and amount \nof her underlying tax liability in this proceeding arises \nonly in connection with her challenge to the proposed \ncollection action.\u201d  Id. at 8.  And if \u201cthe proposed levy \nis moot,\u201d then the taxpayer \u201chas no independent basis to \nchallenge the existence or amount of her underlying tax \nliability\u201d in her proceeding at the Tax Court.34  Id. \nTo arrive at that conclusion, the Greene-Thapedi \nCourt relied on two inapposite and non-precedential Tax \nCourt cases, Chocallo v. Commissioner, T.C.M. (RIA) \n2004-152, and Gerakios v. Commissioner, T.C.M. (RIA) \n2004-203.35  See id. at 7-8.  In both of those cases, the \ntaxpayer was not asserting any ongoing challenge to the \n \n34 The Tax Court also denied a refund to the taxpayer because \n\u201csection 6330 does not expressly give [the Tax Court] jurisdiction \nto determine an overpayment or to order a refund or credit of taxes \npaid.\u201d  Greene-Thapedi, 126 T.C. at 8. \n35 The Tax Court issues memorandum opinions, like Chocallo and \nGerakios, which are considered non-binding precedent.  See Duna-\nway v. Comm\u2019r, 124 T.C. 80, 87 (2005) (\u201c[M]emorandum opinions of \nthis Court are not regarded as binding precedent.\u201d). \n\n31a \n \ntax liability underlying the CDP proceeding when the \nTax Court declared the matter moot.  In Chocallo, the \nIRS discovered during the CDP hearing that it had in-\ncorrectly assessed the taxpayer\u2019s liability and so it re-\nfunded the amount already collected.  Chocallo at 2.  \nAt that point, the IRS moved to dismiss the case as \nmoot.  Id.  The taxpayer then filed a \u201cSupplemental \nMotion for Sanctions, Contempt and For Other Re-\nlief[,]\u201d requesting that the IRS employees who handled \nher case be criminally prosecuted and claiming damages \nfor alleged wrongs committed by IRS employees.  Id.  \nThus, the taxpayer was seeking damages; she was no \nlonger contesting the underlying tax liability that gave \nrise to the suit.  In Gerakios, the taxpayer voluntarily \npaid his tax liabilities after a CDP hearing.  Gerakios \nat 1.  He \u201cdid not dispute his underlying liabilities.\u201d  \nId. at 1 n.1.  He paid the tax because the tax lien was \nhindering his ability to refinance his home.  Id. at 1.  \nHe sought review in the Tax Court claiming only that \nIRS \u201cemployees mistreated him [and] violated his civil \nrights, and that his credit rating was adversely affected \nby the filing of the lien.\u201d  Id.  Since neither case in-\nvolved a taxpayer who was then challenging an underly-\ning tax liability, as is the case here and was in Greene-\nThapedi, the Greene-Thapedi court\u2019s reliance on Cho-\ncallo and Gerakios was misplaced. \nThe Tax Court\u2019s own precedent since Greene-\nThapedi suggests that the case was wrongly decided.  \nIn Vigon v. Commissioner, decided in 2017, the Tax \nCourt held that the IRS cannot unilaterally moot a case \nby withdrawing its proposed collection activity if the \nTax Court has already \u201cobtained jurisdiction of a liabil-\nity challenge when the petition was filed.\u201d  149 T.C. at \n107.  That\u2019s because the \u201cliability issue may remain \n\n32a \n \neven after the collection issues have been resolved or be-\ncome moot.\u201d  Id. at 105.  To be sure, a footnote in Vi-\ngon distinguished it from Greene-Thapedi because \nGreene-Thapedi \u201cinvolved a liability that had been sat-\nisfied\u201d and \u201cnot merely abated,\u201d as in Vigon.  Id. at 105 \nn.4.  But there is nothing in \u00a7 6330 to suggest that dis-\ntinction.  Once the Tax Court has jurisdiction to re-\nsolve a disputed tax liability, it does not lose that juris-\ndiction simply because the IRS decides to satisfy the as-\nserted liability with the taxpayer\u2019s own funds. \nIndeed, even the IRS used to recognize that.  In a \nnotice to its attorneys in 2003, it explained that \u201c[a] mo-\ntion to dismiss for mootness is inappropriate if peti-\ntioner is disputing the existence or amount of the liabil-\nity  . . . .  Even if the liability has been paid, peti-\ntioner may still dispute the liability[.]\u201d  I.R.S. Notice \nCC-2003-016 (May 29, 2003), 2003 WL 24016801 (empha-\nsis added). 36  That is the correct view, and the IRS \n \n36 The IRS \u201cChief Counsel is appointed by the President of the \nUnited States\u201d and is the \u201cchief legal advisor to the IRS Commis-\nsioner on all matters pertaining to the interpretation, administration \nand enforcement of the Internal Revenue Laws[.]\u201d  Office of Chief \nCounsel At-a-Glance, IRS, https://www.irs.gov/about-irs/office- \nof-chief-counsel-at-aglance [https://perma.cc/63NC-KGG9].

Greene-Thapedi\u2019s holding \nthat a taxpayer may only challenge her underlying tax \nliability if there remains an unpaid tax or a proposed \nlevy is erroneous.37 \nc) \nThe Tax Court need not have repayment \nor refund jurisdiction for there to be a \nlive dispute. \nIn Greene-Thapedi, the Tax Court said that, once a \nlevy was removed and the tax was paid, it could not pro-\nvide any other relief to the taxpayer because \u201csection \n6330 does not expressly give [the] Court jurisdiction to \ndetermine an overpayment or to order a refund or credit \nof taxes paid.\u201d  126 T.C. at 8.  It reasoned that full \npayment rendered any conclusion it might make as to \nliability \u201cat best,  . . .  an advisory opinion.\u201d  Id. at \n13. \nA leading tax-procedure treatise, noting that \u201c[m]any \nscholars and practitioners believe that Greene-Thapedi \nreached an incorrect conclusion[,]\u201d explains how the Tax \nCourt got it wrong: \n[A] [t]axpayer\u2019s full payment of the previously unpaid \ntax liability should not render the entire case \u201cmoot\u201d \nif the Tax Court otherwise has jurisdiction over the \nunderlying liability.  Full payment does not neces-\n \napplied incorrectly is certainly a relevant issue to whether the Tax \nCourt CDP proceeding should remain open. \n37 In a footnote in Ahmed v. Commissioner, 64 F.4th 477, 487 n.10 \n(3d Cir. 2023), we stated that a petitioner\u2019s lien-withdrawal request \nwas moot because the IRS had already released its liens once the \ntaxpayer remitted a deposit to the IRS.  But the taxpayer in Ahmed \nnever challenged his underlying tax liability in the CDP hearing, so \nthat case has no bearing here. \n\n34a \n \nsarily resolve the dispute as the Tax Court held.  \nThe question of whether a dispute remains is sepa-\nrate from the question of whether the Tax Court can \ngrant a refund.  Even if granting a refund is barred, \nthe Tax Court could still determine the correct liabil-\nity as part of its CDP determination. \nMichael I. Saltzman & Leslie Book, IRS Practice & Pro-\ncedure \u00b6 14B.16[4][a] (West 2023). \nWe agree.  Notwithstanding any overpayment or \nrefund jurisdiction, a live dispute as to underlying liabil-\nity does not become moot based upon payment of the \n\u201cunpaid\u201d tax.  Section 6330 grants the Tax Court juris-\ndiction to review a CDP determination regarding a tax-\npayer\u2019s properly raised challenge to the existence or \namount of her underlying tax liability, full stop.  That \njurisdiction does not change until the dispute is re-\nsolved.  See Naf\u200atel v. Comm\u2019r, 85 T.C. 527, 530 (1985) \n(\u201c[G]enerally, once a petitioner invokes the jurisdiction \nof the Court, jurisdiction lies with the Court and re-\nmains unimpaired until the Court has decided the con-\ntroversy.\u201d).  Therefore, overpayment or refund juris-\ndiction is not essential to having a live controversy.38 \n \nd) A Tax Court determination of Zuch\u2019s \nright to the estimated payments would \nnot be an impermissible declaratory \njudgment. \nDespite all of the foregoing, the IRS argues that a \nTax Court determination of the proper allocation of the \ntax payments in a CDP hearing would be an improper \n \n38 Accordingly, we need not, and do not, reach any conclusion about \nwhether the Tax Court has overpayment or refund jurisdiction in a \ncontext like this. \n\n35a \n \ndeclaratory judgment.  (Supp. Br. at 15 (\u201cNothing in \nthe Code or Section 6330 authorizes the Tax Court to \nissue advisory opinions or declaratory judgments in \nCDP cases.\u201d).)  The Declaratory Judgment Act allows \nany United States court to render a declaratory judg-\nment when there is a case or controversy, \u201cexcept with \nrespect to Federal taxes[.]\u201d39  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201(a).  If \nthat were all that one knew of the Act, the IRS\u2019s argu-\nment would be more persuasive.  But, although the Act \nis broadly worded, courts have traditionally construed it \nto be coterminous with the Tax Anti-Injunction Act, and \nthat undermines the agency\u2019s position.40 \nThe Tax Anti-Injunction Act generally provides that \nthere can be \u201cno suit for the purpose of restraining the \nassessment or collection of any tax[.]\u201d  \u00a7 7421(a).  But \nit also provides an exception for a request under  \n\u00a7 6330(e)(1) to enjoin a levy via a CDP hearing and any \nappeals.  Id. (prohibiting suits to restrain assessment \nor collection of a tax \u201c[e]xcept as provided in section[]  \n. . .  6330(e)(1),\u201d among others).  Consequently, the \nTax Anti-Injunction Act is not violated when a levy is \nstayed during the pendency of a CDP hearing.  Fur-\nthermore, because the Tax Anti-Injunction Act and the \nDeclaratory Judgment Act are coterminous, the phrase \n\u201c\u200a\u2018with respect to Federal taxes\u2019 [in the Declaratory \nJudgment Act] means \u2018with respect to the assessment or \ncollection of taxes.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Cohen v. United States, 650 F.3d \n717, 727 (D.C. Cir. 2011). \n \n39 The Declaratory Judgment Act carves out some tax exceptions \nthat are not relevant here. \n40 See Z St., Inc. v. Koskinen, 44 F. Supp. 3d 48, 56 (D.D.C. 2014) \n(collecting cases from the Fourth, Sixth, Seventh, Ninth, Tenth, and \nD.C. Circuits). \n\n36a \n \nThus, when a court has the power to enjoin a levy un-\nder the Tax Anti-Injunction Act, it also has the power to \ndeclare the rights of the parties in that proceeding with-\nout violating the Declaratory Judgment Act.  As the \nD.C. Circuit has explained, \na functional concern exists with construing the [De-\nclaratory Judgment Act]\u2019s exception to bar relief oth-\nerwise allowed under the [Tax Anti-Injunction Act].  \nThe court would have jurisdiction to enjoin the par-\nties appearing before it, but not to declare their \nrights.  This defies common sense, however, \u201csince \nan injunction of a tax and a judicial declaration that a \ntax is illegal have the same prohibitory effect on the \nfederal government\u2019s ability to assess and collect \ntaxes.\u201d \nId. at 730 (quoting Wyoming Trucking Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. \nBentsen, 82 F.3d 930, 933 (10th Cir. 1996)); see also \nTomlinson v. Smith, 128 F.2d 808, 811 (7th Cir. 1942) \n(\u201c[T]he jurisdiction of the court to issue a restraining or-\nder is  . . .  determinative of its jurisdiction to de-\nclare the rights of the parties relative thereto.  It is un-\nreasonable to think that a court with authority to issue \na restraining order is without power to declare the \nrights of the parties in connection therewith.\u201d). \nBecause the Declaratory Judgment Act does not bar \nthe Tax Court from declaring the rights to estimated \npayments at issue in a CDP hearing, there is a live case \nand controversy, and a Tax Court determination of \nZuch\u2019s tax liability would not be an improper declara-\ntory judgment. \n \n\n37a \n \n \ne) The IRS has not met its burden to show \nthat no relief would be available to Zuch \nif the Tax Court declared she had a right \nto the estimated payments. \nTo show mootness, the IRS must prove that Zuch \ncould have no relief whatsoever if the Tax Court were to \ndeclare that she had a right to the estimated payments.  \nGiven what we have already said here, to carry its heavy \nburden, the IRS must prove that a declaration by the \nTax Court of Zuch\u2019s rights in her CDP case would not \nhave preclusive effect on a future refund claim.  In a \nsupplemental brief, the IRS has taken the position that \nsuch a determination would not have any preclusive ef-\nfect, but it cites no relevant authority to support that \nproposition.  And, indeed, the IRS Office of Chief \nCounsel has at least twice issued notices indicating the \nopposite.  See I.R.S. Notice CC-2006-005 (Nov. 21, \n2005), 2005 WL 3272051 (\u201cA judicial determination in a \nCDP case of a taxpayer\u2019s underlying tax liability for a \ntaxable year (which may be less than the taxpayer\u2019s pay-\nments for that year) may be subject to estoppel princi-\nples in a subsequent refund action[.]\u201d); I.R.S. Notice \nCC-2009-010 (Feb. 13, 2009), 2009 WL 497736 (\u201cA judi-\ncial determination of the amount of the underlying tax \nliability in a CDP case may, however, estop both parties \nfrom contesting the amount of that same liability in a \nsubsequent refund action[.]\u201d).41  Accordingly, the IRS \n \n41 At argument, the IRS asserted that any refund claim Zuch had \nis barred by the statute of limitations in \u00a7 6511.  But in its supple-\nmental brief, the IRS now says that it \u201chas determined that she \nmay still be able to file a refund suit in the district court or Court \nof Federal Claims.\u201d  (Supp. Br. at 3.)  It explains that Zuch did \nnot receive the required two-year notice of disallowance that would \nhave triggered the two-year limitations period for filing a refund \n \n\n38a \n \nhas not met its heavy burden to show that Zuch would \nhave no relief whatsoever if the Tax Court were to de-\nclare she has a right to the estimated tax payments.  \nAnd, of course, an agency of the United States, having \nreceived a court order declaring a citizen\u2019s rights, is ex-\npected to either appeal it or abide by it.42 \n \nsuit under \u00a7 6532(a)(1).  Because of the Tucker Act, however, it is \nunclear whether a court will hear Zuch\u2019s refund claim.  That Act \nbars any suit against the United States \u201cunless the complaint is \nfiled within six years after the right of action first accrues.\u201d  28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2401(a).  The Court of Federal Claims has longstanding \nprecedent that \u00a7 6532 preempts the Tucker Act\u2019s general statute \nof limitations.  Detroit Tr. Co. v. United States, 130 F. Supp. 815, \n818 (Ct. Cl. 1955).  And the IRS has repeatedly opined that the \nTucker Act does not apply to tax refund claims.  Rev. Rul. 56-381, \n1956-2 C.B. 953; I.R.S. CCA 201044006 (Nov. 5, 2010), 2010 WL \n4384169; I.R.S. Notice CC-2012-012 (Jun. 1, 2012), 2012 WL \n2029785; I.R.S. IRM 34.5.2.2(5) (Apr. 22, 2021), https://www.irs.gov/ \nirm/part34/irm_34-005-002 [https://perma.cc/46FG-E3TE].  If \nthat were true, Zuch may not be barred from filing a refund claim \nbecause the two-year limitations period under \u00a7 6532 has not been \ntriggered.  But three district courts have held that the six-year \nlimitations period is the outer limit for any claims against the gov-\nernment.  See Breland v. United States, No. 10-cv-00007, 2011 \nWL 4345300, at *6-7 (N.D.N.Y Sept. 15, 2011); Wagenet v. United \nStates, No. 8-cv-00142, 2009 WL 4895363, at *3 (C.D. Cal. Sept. 14, \n2009); Finkelstein v. United States, 943 F. Supp. 425, 432 (D.N.J. \n1996).  Under that view, Zuch\u2019s refund suit would be time-barred \nbecause six years have passed since her right accrued to file a re-\nfund claim.  We do not reach any conclusion today concerning the \nviability of a refund claim.  She may have a viable claim, and that \nis enough for today\u2019s purposes. \n42 If enforcement were needed, requiring a taxpayer to go to a dif-\nferent court to enforce a right judicially determined in the Tax Court \nis consistent with historical practice.  In fact, for over sixty years, \nthe Tax Court had jurisdiction to determine a taxpayer\u2019s overpay-\nment in a deficiency proceeding but did not have authority to order \n \n\n39a \n \nIII. CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, we will vacate the Tax \nCourt\u2019s order of dismissal and remand for that tribunal \nto determine whether Zuch is entitled to receive credit \nfor any amount of the estimated tax payments at issue. \n \n \na refund consistent with that determination.  See Greene-Thapedi, \n126 T.C. at 9 (explaining that the Tax Court had overpayment, but \nno refund, jurisdiction from 1926 until the enactment of \u00a7 6512(b) in \n1988). \n\n40a \n \nAPPENDIX B \n \nUNITED STATES TAX COURT \nWASHINGTON, DC 20217 \n \nDocket No. 25125-14L \nJENNIFER ZUCH, PETITIONER \nv. \nCOMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, RESPONDENT \n \nFiled:  Apr. 6, 2022 \n \nORDER OF DISMISSAL \n \nThis section 6330(d)1 case is before the Court on re-\nspondent\u2019s motion to dismiss on grounds of mootness, \nfiled March 6, 2020.  Petitioner\u2019s objection to respond-\nent\u2019s motion was filed on April 13, 2020. \nIn a Notice of Determination Concerning Collection \nAction(s) Under Section 6320 and/or 6330, dated Sep-\ntember 25, 2014 (notice), respondent determined that a \nlevy is an appropriate collection action with respect to \npetitioner\u2019s then outstanding 2010 Federal income tax \nliability (underlying liability).  The submissions of the \nparties show their agreement to the events, summarized \nbelow. \n \n1  Unless otherwise indicated, section references are to the Inter-\nnal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. \n\n41a \n \nOn September 12, 2012, petitioner filed her 2010 Fed-\neral income tax return as a married person filing a sep-\narate return.  On the return, petitioner reported ad-\njusted gross income of $74,493, tax due of $7,736, and \nwithheld Federal tax of $8,607.  The return showed a \n$731 overpayment, which respondent applied to the 2008 \njoint tax liability of petitioner and her former spouse, \nPatrick Gennardo. \nPetitioner submitted an amended 2010 Federal in-\ncome tax return (amended return), filed November 14, \n2012.  On the amended return, as relevant, petitioner \nreported a $71,000 increase in adjusted gross income, \nadditional tax due of $27,682, estimated tax payments of \n$50,000, and a $21,918 overpayment.  Respondent as-\nsessed the additional tax due of $27,682 reported on the \namended return.  Respondent further assessed an ad-\ndition to tax under section 6651(a)(1) for failure to file a \ntimely return of $7,020.50. \nBy letter dated August 31, 2013, petitioner was ad-\nvised that respondent intended to levy (proposed collec-\ntion action) in order to collect the underlying liability.  \nThat letter also advised petitioner of her right to chal-\nlenge that proposed collection action by requesting an \nadministrative hearing, which she did.  See sec. 6330(a) \nand (b).  Respondent received petitioner\u2019s timely ad-\nministrative hearing request, dated September 27, 2013, \nin which petitioner alleged that the $50,000 of estimated \ntax payments should be credited to her 2010 income tax \naccount and further requested that any penalty should \nbe abated for reasonable cause.  Respondent\u2019s settle-\nment officer considered and rejected petitioner\u2019s re-\nquests, and because petitioner did not request a collec-\n\n42a \n \ntion alternative during the administrative hearing, the \nnotice was issued and this case ensued. \nThe petition in this case raises issues related exclu-\nsively to the amount of the underlying liability, including \npetitioner\u2019s entitlement to the abatement of penalties.  \nAccording to petitioner, (1) the underlying liability \nwould be eliminated if the estimated tax payments were \nproperly credited to petitioner\u2019s income tax account, and \n(2) she is entitled to the refund of the overpayment \nshown on her amended return.  After the petition in \nthis case was filed, on April 15, 2019, respondent cred-\nited petitioner\u2019s income tax account with a $14,883.19 \noffset arising from her income tax account for 2018, \nwhich resulted in the satisfaction of the underlying lia-\nbility.  The payment of the underlying liability, in turn, \nresulted in the motion here under consideration. \nRelying upon Greene-Thapedi v. Commissioner, 126 \nT.C. 1 (2006), and pointing out that the underlying lia-\nbility has now been paid, respondent argues that the \ncase is moot because respondent no longer intends to \npursue the proposed collection action.  Petitioner ob-\njects to respondent\u2019s motion.  According to petitioner, \n\u201cbecause  * * *  [respondent] did not issue a valid no-\ntice of deficiency [with respect to the 2010 assessment]  \n* * *  [r]espondent\u2019s assessment is void\u201d.  Petitioner \nfurther contends that section 6330(c)(2)(B) obligates the  \nCourt to determine the existence or amount of the un-\nderlying liability and that she is due a refund for an \noverpayment for 2010.  That being so, petitioner ar-\ngues the case is not moot because the parties disagree \nover the amount of the overpayment of petitioner\u2019s 2010 \nFederal income tax liability.  \n\n43a \n \nPetitioner is concerned that unless the underlying is \ndetermined in this proceeding, she will be forced to pur-\nsue any refund to which she might be entitled through \ntraditional Federal income tax refund procedures, in-\ncluding if necessary, initiating a case in a different Fed-\neral court.  Petitioner\u2019s concerns, although well-founded, \nare insufficient to defeat respondent\u2019s motion.  Be-\ncause we do not have jurisdiction to determine an over-\npayment or to order a refund or credit of tax paid in a \nsection 6330 proceeding, this is not the proper forum to \ndetermine whether, and the extent to which, if any, the \nunderlying liability has been overpaid.  See Greene-\nThapedi v. Commissioner, 26 T.C. at 11.  Although we \nhave concerns about the merits of petitioner\u2019s position \non the point, see secs. 6201(1), 6665(b), under the circum-\nstances we need not address the validity of the assess-\nment as petitioner requests us to do. \nBecause there is no unpaid liability for the determi-\nnation year upon which a levy could be based, and re-\nspondent is no longer pursuing the proposed collection \naction, this case is moot.  See McClane v. Commissioner, \n24 F.4th 316 (4th Cir. 2022) aff\u200a\u2019g T.C. Memo. 2018-149; \nsee also Greene-Thapedi v. Commissioner, 26 T.C. 1. \nPremises considered, it is \nORDERED that respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss on \ngrounds of mootness, filed March 6, 2020, is granted.  \nIt is further \nORDERED that this case is dismissed as moot. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(Signed) Lewis R.

No new infor-\nmation was presented to Appeals by the taxpayer.  The \noriginal decision to sustain the levy action taken by \nCompliance is being upheld by Appeals. \nBrief Background \nA telephonic conference was held with your POA on \n07/29/2014.  During that call, your request to have \n$50,000.00 in credits moved from your husband\u2019s ac-\ncount to your account was denied.  On 09/25/2014, you \nwere issued Letter 3193 (Notice of Determination) by \nAppeals.  Your POA petitioned Tax Court on your be-\nhalf.  The case was reviewed by the court and re-\nmanded back to Appeals in an order dated 12/29/2016.  \nThe court ordered that Appeals address several issues \nthat needed clarification (in the court\u2019s opinion) regard-\ning the aforementioned credits. \nSeveral calls between Appeals, IRS Area Counsel, and \nthe POA took place between February and May of 2017 \nwith the final call taking place on 05/26/2017.  All calls, \n\n47a \n \nexcept for the last call were made in an attempt to se-\ncure additional information in order for us to reconsider \nthe disposition of the payments at issue, but nothing new \nwas ever supplied to Appeals. \nOn 05/26/2017, it was determined that Appeals was not \nin a position to change our original determination to sus-\ntain Compliance\u2019s issuance of their final notice of intent \nto levy and that we would not move any credits to your \naccount from your husband\u2019s account. \nLegal and Procedural Requirements \nI, Mario C Tevis, verified the requirements of any appli-\ncable law or administrative procedure were met.  IRS \nrecords confirmed the proper issuance of the notice and \ndemand, Notice of Intent to Levy and/or Notice of Fed-\neral Tax Lien (NFTL) filing, and notice of a right to a \nCollection Due Process (CDP) hearing. \nAn assessment was properly made for each tax and pe-\nriod listed on the CDP notice.  \nNotice and demand for payment was mailed to your last \nknown address. \nThere was a balance due when the Notice of Intent to \nLevy was issued or when the NFTL filing was request-\ned. \nI had no prior involvement with respect to the specific \ntax periods either in Appeals or Compliance. \nI reviewed the Collection file, IRS records and infor-\nmation you provided.  My review confirmed that the \nIRS followed all legal and procedural requirements, and \nthe actions taken or proposed were appropriate under \nthe circumstances. \n\n48a \n \nIssues relating to the unpaid liability \nIn an order from Tax Court dated December 29, 2016, \nthe court remanded your case back to Appeals.  The \nTax Court questioned three (3) items: \n1. \nThe legal basis for which the $20,000.00 payment \nwas applied to the account of the Gennardo\u2019s. \nAppeals reviewed that the $20,000.00 payment in ques-\ntion was received as a joint 1040 ES payment (applied \non 06/19/2010).  It was applied to your husband\u2019s ac-\ncount, as he was the primary taxpayer on the joint ac-\ncount. \nAppeals reviewed that you and your husband then filed \nseparate income tax (1040) returns for the tax year \nended 12/31/2010.  Your initial tax liability was fully \nsatisfied with your withholdings, which subsequently \ngenerated a refund to you. \nThe $20,000.00 1040 ES payment in question was never \nan issue until an amended 1040X was filed and an addi-\ntional assessment was made.  That assessment was \nmade on 02/11/2013 in the amount of $27,682.00 (plus \nP&I). \n2. \nWhether the payment of $30,000.00 was a separate \nor joint payment. \nThe $30,000.00 payment was made by bank check, dated \n12/14/2010 and had only Mr. Gennardo\u2019s name on it.  It \nwas applied accordingly, to him. \n3. \nThe circumstances surrounding Gennardo\u2019s Offer in \nCompromise. \nMr. Gennardo has an accepted Offer in Compromise \n(OIC).  In accordance with the terms of any OIC filed \n\n49a \n \nat that time, Section 8 of OIC Form 656 (Rev. 5-2012), \nparagraph (d), states \u201cThe IRS will keep any monies it \nhas collected prior to this offer and any payments that I \nmake relating to this offer that I did not designate as a \ndeposit\u201d.  It should be known that his OIC was filed on \n09/18/2012 and accepted on 07/17/2013. \nIt should also be known that your denial for penalty \nabatement was never raised by the court and that our \ninitial determination to deny your request for abate-\nment still stands. \nBalancing efficient tax collection with concern regarding \nintrusiveness \nReview of your tax payment transfer request and your \nrequest for penalty abetment are both denied.  Ap-\npeals received no new information that would compel us \nto consider either of your two requests. \nTherefore, our determination is that the proposed levy \naction balances the need for efficient collection of taxes \nwith the taxpayer\u2019s legitimate concern that any collec-\ntion action be no more intrusive than necessary.  The \naction taken by Compliance is being sustained by Ap-\npeals. \n\n50a \n \nAPPENDIX D \n \nUNITED STATES TAX COURT \nWASHINGTON, DC 20217 \n \nDocket No. 25125-14L \nJENNIFER ZUCH, PETITIONER(S) \nv. \nCOMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, RESPONDENT \n \nFiled:  Dec. 12, 2016 \n \nORDER \n \nThis collection review case is before the Court on re-\nspondent\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment filed on \nApril 29, 2015, pursuant to Rule 121.1  Respondent con-\ntends that the Court should affirm the determination of \nthe Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals sustain-\ning a proposed levy to collect petitioner\u2019s unpaid Fed-\neral income tax for 2010.  Petitioner objects to the mo-\ntion for summary judgment. \nA. \nBackground \nThe record establishes and/or the parties do not dis-\npute the following facts. \n \n1  Rule references are to the Tax Court Rules of Practice and Pro-\ncedure and section references are to the Internal Revenue Code, \nas amended. \n\n51a \n \n \n1. \nEstimated Payments \nPetitioner resided in New Jersey when the petition \nin this case was timely filed.  Petitioner was married to \nPatrick J. Gennardo during the year in issue.  Peti-\ntioner and Mr. Gennardo elected married filing joint fil-\ning status for their Federal income tax returns for 2007, \n2008, and 2009.2 \nPetitioner and Mr. Gennardo mailed to the Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS or respondent) a 2010 Form 1040-\nES, Estimated Payment, with a $20,000 personal check \npayable to U.S. Treasury dated June 15, 2010.  The \nForm 1040-ES listed both Mr. Gennardo\u2019s and peti-\ntioner\u2019s names and social security numbers, and the check \nlisted both of their names on the account.  On June 19, \n2010, the IRS applied the $20,000 payment to peti-\ntioner\u2019s and Mr. Gennardo\u2019s married filing joint account \nfor 2010. \nOn January 10, 2011, Mr. Gennardo sent a letter via \nFederal Express to the attention of Ms. L. Washington \nat the IRS office in Paramus, New Jersey.  The subject \nof the letter was \u201cRe: Patrick J. Gennardo and Jennifer \nZuch\u201d and Mr. Gennardo wrote \u201cEnclosed please find \nthe payments we discussed in December\u201d.  Included \nwith the letter was a $30,000 bank check payable to the \nU.S. Treasury dated December 14, 2010, which was \ndrawn from petitioner\u2019s and Mr. Gennardo\u2019s joint Citi-\nbank bank account.  On the bank check in the space for \n\u201cremitter\u201d only Mr. Gennardo\u2019 s name was listed.  On \nJanuary 11, 2011, the IRS applied the $30,000 payment \n \n2  Copies of IRS account transcripts reflect that as of July 23, \n2012, petitioner and Mr. Gennardo had outstanding liabilities and \npenalties for 2007, 2008, and 2009. \n\n52a \n \nto petitioner\u2019s and Mr. Gennardo\u2019s married filing joint \naccount for 2010. \n \n2. \nTax Returns \n \n \n \na. \nOriginal Tax Returns \nPetitioner and Mr. Gennardo each filed a Federal in-\ncome tax return electing married filing separate status \nfor 2010. \nPetitioner submitted a delinquent 2010 Form 1040, \nU.S. Individual Income Tax Return, dated September \n12, 2012, and filed October 29, 2012.3  On this return pe-\ntitioner reported $7,736 in tax due, federal tax withheld \nof $8,067, and $0 in estimated tax payments. \nMr. Gennardo also submitted a delinquent 2010 Form \n1040 on September 12, 2012, which was filed on October \n29, 2012.  On this return Mr. Gennardo reported $10,000 \nin estimated tax payments.  Mr. Gennardo\u2019s return re-\nflected a balance due and he did not remit payment. \nAt some point after Mr. Gennardo filed his 2010 Form \n1040 the IRS applied the $50,000 in estimated payments \nto his account as a married filing separate taxpayer.4 \n \n \n \nb. Amended Tax Returns \nPetitioner filed a 2010 Form 1040X, Amended U.S. \nIndividual Income Tax Return, dated November 14, \n2012.  Petitioner\u2019s power of attorney (POA) Lawrence \nBrody hand-delivered a copy of her 2010 Form 1040X to \nIRS Revenue Officer (RO) Robyn Scherzer on Novem-\n \n3  Petitioner did not request an extension of time to file her 2010 \nFederal income tax return. \n4  It is unclear from the record as to exactly when the two pay-\nments were applied to Mr. Gennardo\u2019s account. \n\n53a \n \nber 14, 2012.  On her amended return petitioner re-\nported additional income of $71,000 from a retirement \ndistribution and claimed an additional $50,000 in esti-\nmated tax payments, reporting additional tax due of \n$27,683 and requesting a refund of $22,649. \nAlong with petitioner\u2019s 2010 Form 1040X, Mr. Brody \nalso hand-delivered to RO Scherzer a copy of a 2010 \nForm 1040X for Mr. Gennardo, signed and dated No-\nvember 10, 2012.  Mr. Gennardo reported $0 in esti-\nmated tax payments on this 2010 Form 1040X. \nRespondent did not apply the $50,000 in estimated \npayments to petitioner\u2019s account and assessed addi-\ntional tax due of $27,682 based on her amended return \non February 11, 2013. \nMr. Gennardo submitted another 2010 Form 1040X \ndated March 13, 2013.  Mr. Gennardo reported $0 in es-\ntimated tax payments on this amended return, an ad-\njustment from the $10,000 in estimated payments origi-\nnally reported.  Mr. Gennardo attached to this amended \nreturn a \u201cstatement 1\u201d which asserted his reasons for \namending his 2010 return including:  (1) \u201cto show \n$10,000 payment on original tax return not paid\u201d and  \n(2) \u201cthere were estimated payments of $50,000 allocated \nto the spouse Jennifer Zuch\u201d.5  The IRS received Mr. \nGennardo\u2019s amended return prior to May 2013. \n \n5  It does not appear that Mr. Gennardo\u2019s 2010 Form 1040X pro-\nvided to Ms. Scherzer on November 14, 2012 (2012 version), was \nfiled with the IRS.  The Form 1040X filed by Mr. Gennardo in \n2013 (as filed version) differs in several ways from the 2012 version.  \nRelevant to the case before the Court, in the 2012 version Mr. Gen-\nnardo did not list the $10,000 in estimated payments as originally  \nclaimed on his 2010 Form 1040 and he did not include a statement 1.  \n\n54a \n \nBoth versions of Mr. Gennardo\u2019s Form 1040X and pe-\ntitioner\u2019s Form 1040X were prepared by the same certi-\nfied public accountant Steven Moses. \n \n3. \nMr. Gennardo\u2019 s Offer in Compromise \nOn September 18, 2012, 6 days after filing his original \n2010 Federal income tax return, Mr. Gennardo submit-\nted to the IRS an offer-in-compromise (OIC) relating to \nhis 2010 tax liability.  The IRS accepted Mr. Gennardo\u2019s \nOIC on July 17, 2013, and applied the $50,000 in esti-\nmated payments to Mr. Gennardo\u2019s outstanding 2010 \ntax liability as part of the agreement.6 \n \n 4. \nPetitioner\u2019s CDP Hearing \nOn August 31, 2013, the IRS issued to petitioner a \nFinal Notice of Intent to Levy and Notice of Your Right \nto a Hearing, informing her of the intent to collect the \nassessed balance of $31,802 for 2010 as well as a late pay-\nment penalty of $1,496 and interest.  On September 27, \n2013, petitioner\u2019s POA Frank Agostino timely submitted \non petitioner\u2019s behalf a Form 12153, Request for a Col-\nlection Due Process or Equivalent Hearing, and a cover \nletter.  Petitioner asserted in her Form 12153 and the \nattached letter that the $50,000 in estimated payments \nfor 2010 should have been applied to her tax due for 2010 \nand requested abatement of the late payment penalty \nfor reasonable cause.  Petitioner attached to the Form \n12153 a copy of the IRS account transcript for the 2010 \n \n6  The documents submitted by Mr. Gennardo for the Offer in Com-\npromise were not made part of the record.  At the hearing on the \nmotion for summary judgment respondent asserted that Mr. Gen-\nnardo\u2019s OIC was for \u201chis tax liability for 2010 and other years\u201d. \n\n55a \n \nmarried filing joint showing the $50,000 in estimated \npayments and her 2010 Form 1040X. \nPetitioner\u2019s case was assigned to Settlement Officer \n(SO) Mario Tevis in the Newark, New Jersey Office.  \nSO Tevis and Mr. Brody had a telephone conversation \non March 10, 2014, during which Mr. Brody informed SO \nTevis that petitioner\u2019s husband Mr. Gennardo support-\nted petitioner\u2019s position regarding application of the es-\ntimated payments.  On March 17, 2014, Mr. Brody \nemailed to SO Tevis a declaration from Mr. Gennardo \nsigned under penalty of perjury and dated March 12, \n2014.  Mr. Gennardo asserted in this declaration that \nthe $50,000 in estimated tax payments for 2010 were in-\ntended to be joint estimated payments and he directed \nthat these payments be applied to petitioner\u2019s unpaid \ntax. \nOn July 29, 2014, SO Tevis and Mr. Brody conducted \na telephonic collection due process (CDP) hearing.  SO \nTevis informed Mr. Brody that he believed that the IRS \ncould not credit any of the $50,000 in estimated pay-\nments to petitioner\u2019s account because it had already \nbeen applied to Mr. Gennardo\u2019s account, which was  \nsubject to an OIC.  During this telephone conference \nSO Thompson also denied petitioner\u2019s request for abate-\nment of penalties. \nAfter the telephone conference Mr. Brody sent to SO \nThompson a letter dated July 29, 2014, via email, fax, \nand first class mail.  In his letter Mr. Brody argued \nagain that the $50,000 in estimated payments should be \ncredited to petitioner\u2019s 2010 account pursuant to her \nagreement with Mr. Gennardo, and for this reason any \npenalties for late payment should be abated.  Mr. \nBrody also stated that a penalty for late filing should be \n\n56a \n \nabated due to reasonable cause because petitioner \u201cwas \nunder extreme emotional distress due to her husband \nmoving out of the marital home to live with his boy-\nfriend\u201d and petitioner and Mr. Gennardo were \u201ccurrent-\nly in divorce proceedings.\u201d \nOn September 25, 2014, SO Thompson sent a Notice \nof Determination Concerning Collection Action(s) Un-\nder Section 6320 and/or 6330 of the Internal Revenue \nCode, sustaining the Final Notice of Intent to Levy (No-\ntice of Determination). \n \n 5. \nMotion for Summary Judgment \nOn October 22, 2014, petitioner timely filed a petition \ncommencing this case.  Petitioner asserts in her peti-\ntion that respondent should have allocated the $50,000 \nin estimated tax payments to her 2010 unpaid tax be-\ncause of her agreement with Mr. Gennardo and re-\nquested a refund of any overpayment.  Petitioner also \nrequested abatement of penalties.  \nOn April 29, 2015, respondent filed the Motion for \nSummary Judgment presently before the Court.  Re-\nspondent filed the Declaration of Mario C. Tevis in Sup-\nport of Respondent\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment.  \nOn June 25, 2015, petitioner filed a Notice of Objection \nto Motion for Summary Judgment, a Memorandum of \nLaw in Opposition to Respondent\u2019s Motion for Summary \nJudgment, and a Declaration of Lawrence M. Brody in \nSupport of Notice of Objection to Motion for Summary \nJudgment.  Petitioner\u2019s attorney Mr. Brody included \nwith his declaration as Exhibit C a copy of the Declara-\ntion of Patrick Gennardo, signed and dated June 24, \n2015.  On July 14, 2015, petitioner filed a Motion for \nLeave to File Out of Time Declaration of Jeffrey Dir-\n\n57a \n \nmann in Support for Notice of Objection, which the \nCourt granted. \nThe Court held a hearing on respondent\u2019s Motion at \nthe New York, New York trial session on October 31, \n2016. \nB. \nDiscussion \nSummary judgment serves to \u201cexpedite litigation \nand avoid unnecessary and expensive trials.\u201d  Florida \nPeach Corp. v. Commissioner, 90 T.C. 678, 681 (1988).  \nThe Court may grant summary judgment when there is \nno genuine dispute as to any material fact and a decision \nmay be rendered as a matter of law.  Rule 121(b); \nSundstrand Corp. v. Commissioner, 98 T.C. 518, 520 \n(1992), aff\u200a\u2019d, 17 F.3d 965 (7th Cir. 1994).  In deciding \nwhether to grant summary judgment, we construe  \nfactual materials and inferences drawn from them in  \nthe light most favorable to the nonmoving party. \nSundstrand Corp., 98 T.C. at 520.  Respondent, as the \nmoving party, bears the burden of proving that no gen-\nuine dispute or issue exists as to any material fact and \nthat respondent is entitled to judgment as a matter of \nlaw.  FPL Group, Inc. v. Commissioner, 115 T.C. 554, \n559 (2000); Bond v. Commissioner, 100 T.C. 32, 36 \n(1993); Naftel v. Commissioner, 85 T.C. 527, 529 (1985).  \nHowever, where the moving party properly makes and \nsupports a motion for summary judgment, the taxpayer \n\u201cmay not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of \nsuch party\u2019s pleading\u201d but must set forth specific facts \nshowing that there is a genuine dispute for trial.  Rule \n121(d); see also Naftel v. Commissioner, 85 T.C. at 529. \n \n\n58a \n \nSection 6331(a) authorizes the Secretary to levy upon \nproperty and property rights of a taxpayer liable for \ntaxes who fails to pay those taxes within 10 days after a \nnotice and demand for payment is made.  The taxpayer \nwho receives the notice can request a collection due pro-\ncess (CDP) hearing with an appeals officer.  Sec. \n6330(b).  The taxpayer can raise at the hearing \u201cany \nrelevant issue relating to the unpaid tax or proposed \nlevy\u201d including challenges to the appropriateness of the \ncollection action and an offer of a collection alternative.  \nSec. 6330(c)(2)(A).  If a CDP hearing is requested, the \nhearing is to be conducted by the IRS Office of Appeals, \nand, at the hearing, the officer conducting the confer-\nence must verify that the requirements of any applicable \nlaw or administrative procedure have been met.  Sec. \n6330(b)(1), (c)(1). \nThis Court has jurisdiction under section 6330 to re-\nview the Commissioner\u2019s administrative determina-\ntions.  Sec. 6330(d); see Iannone v. Commissioner, 122 \nT.C. 287,290 (2004).  Where the underlying tax liability \nis at properly at issue we review the determination de \nnovo.  Sego v. Commissioner, 114 T.C. 604, 610 (2000).  \nWhere the underlying tax liability is not at issue we re-\nview the determination for abuse of discretion.  Goza v. \nCommissioner, 114 T.C. 176, 182 (2000).  We need not \nand do not decide which standard to apply in the context \nof the motion for summary judgment.7  We conclude at \n \n7  See Freije v. Commissioner, 125 T.C. 14, 23, 26-27 (2005) (ap-\nplying abuse of discretion standard where taxpayer in CDP case \nchallenged IRS\u2019 failure to credit overpayments).  Compare \nLandry v. Commissioner, 116 T.C. 60, 62 (2001) (applying de novo \nstandard where taxpayer challenged application of overpayment \ncredits, reasoning that \u201cthe validity of the underlying tax liability, \ni.e., the amount unpaid after application of credits to which peti-\n \n\n59a \n \nthis juncture that respondent has not established that \nno genuine dispute exists as to material facts.  We do \nhowever make some observations based on the current \nstatus of the record. \nFirst, it would appear that the $20,000 estimated pay-\nment, accompanied with the Form 1040-ES listing both \npetitioner\u2019s and Mr. Gennardo\u2019s names and social secu-\nrity numbers, was a joint estimated tax payment.  We \ndo not fully understand the factual or legal basis upon \nwhich respondent applied the payment to Mr. Gen-\nnardo\u2019s tax liabilities which was ultimately credited as \npart of the OIC. \nSecond, the status of the $30,000 estimated payment \nis even less clear.  Respondent asserts that the payment \nwas intended to be a separate payment, pointing to the \nfact that only Mr. Gennardo\u2019s name was written on the \ncheck.  Petitioner asserts that the payment was in-\ntended to be a joint payment, pointing to the fact that it \nwas made from the joint checking account she shared \nwith Mr. Gennardo, Mr. Gennardo\u2019s declaration that it \nwas intended to be an estimated payment, and Mr. Gen-\nnardo\u2019s letter to the IRS that accompanied the payment \nwith the subject line \u201cRe: Patrick J. Gennardo and Jen-\nnifer Zuch\u201d.  We do not have further context regarding \nthis letter to Ms. Washington, such as her interactions \n \ntioner is entitled, [was] properly at issue\u201d), with Kovacevich v. \nCommissioner, T.C. Memo. 2009-160, 98 T.C.M. (CCH) 1, 4 & n.10 \n(applying abuse of discretion standard where taxpayer challenged \napplication of tax payments, reasoning that \u201cquestions about whether \na particular check was properly credited to a particular taxpayer\u2019s \naccount for a particular tax year are not challenges to his underly-\ning tax liability\u201d), and Orian v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 2010-\n234, 100 T.C.M. (CCH) 356, 359 (same). \n\n60a \n \nor conversation with Mr. Gennardo.  Nor do we know \nwhy only Mr. Gennardo\u2019 s name was written on the \ncheck.  It is also not clear from the record as to when \npetitioner and Mr. Gennardo decided to file their 2010 \nForm 1040s separately.  Thus, it is unclear whether the \n$30,000 payment was a separate payment or a joint pay-\nment. \nThird, circumstances surrounding Mr. Gennardo\u2019s \nOIC are not clear.  Issues that may be relevant include \nwhether the OIC included petitioner\u2019s and Mr. Gen-\nnardo\u2019s joint tax liabilities for 2007, 2008, and 2009 or \nany other joint liability tax year?  Further, if the OIC \ninvolved any joint tax liability year was petitioner in-\nvolved in the process? \nFor these reasons we find that respondent has not \nmet his burden of proving that no genuine dispute exists \nas to this material fact.  See FPL Group, Inc. v. Com-\nmissioner, 115 T.C. at 559; Bond v. Commissioner, 100 \nT.C. at 36; Naftel v. Commissioner, 85 T.C. at 529.  \nThus, we will deny respondent\u2019s motion for summary \njudgment.  See Rule 121(b); Sundstrand Corp. v. Com-\nmissioner, 98 T.C. at 520. \nUpon due consideration and for cause, it is \nORDERED that respondent\u2019s Motion For Summary \nJudgment, filed April 29, 2015, is denied. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(Signed) Peter J.

The notice was issued out on 08/31/2013.  A \ntimely CDP request was received by Compliance on \n09/27/2013.  Appeals has determined to sustain the ac-\ntion (levy) taken by Compliance. \nBRIEF BACKGROUND \nAppeals issued letter 3855 to you on 11/20/2013.  Letter \n3855 requested that you provide Appeals with Form \n433-A.  Letter 3855 also set up for a phone conference \nto be held on 01/07/2014.  You were given 14 days, from \nthe date of Letter 3855 to provide Form 433-A.  Form \n433-A was provided and a face to face conference was \nrequested in the Newark Appeals office. \nOn 03/10/2014, S/O Tevis reviewed your case arid spoke \nwith your POA (Mr. Brody).  During that conversation, \nit was determined that a face to face conference was not \nnecessary. \nA telephonic conference was held on 07/29/2014 between \nS/O Tevis and POA Brody.  Your request to have the \n\n65a \n \npayment credits moved from your husband\u2019s account  \nto your account was denied.  Your request for penalty \nabatement was also denied.  It was agreed that you did \nnot want a collection alternative (i.e. installment agree-\nment, OIC) and that a Notice of Determination would be \nissued. \nLEGAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW \nI, Mario Tevis, verified the requirements of any applica-\nble law or administrative procedure were met.  IRS \nrecords confirmed the proper issuance of the notice and \ndemand, Notice of Intent to Levy and/or Notice of Fed-\neral Tax Lien (NFTL) filing, and notice of a right to a \nCollection Due Process (CDP) hearing. \nAn assessment was properly made for each tax and pe-\nriod listed on the CDP notice.   \nNotice and demand for payment was mailed to your last \nknown address. \nThere was a balance due when the Notice of Intent to \nLevy was issued or when the NFTL filing was request-\ned. \nI had no prior involvement with respect to the specific \ntax periods either in Appeals or Compliance. \nI reviewed the Collection file, IRS records and infor-\nmation you provided.  My review confirmed that the \nIRS followed all legal and procedural requirements and \nthe actions taken or proposed were appropriate under \nthe circumstances. \nISSUES YOU RAISED \nCollection Alternatives Requested \nYou offered no alternatives to collection. \n\n66a \n \nChallenges to the Liability \nYou disagree with your liability because you felt that \nyou should be given credit for the tax payments made to \nyour husband\u2019s account.  You also felt that you should \nbe granted penalty abatement. \nAppeals reviewed that you filed an original 1040 and \nthen an amended 1040 for the 12/31/2010 tax year.  The \noriginal 1040 showed that you were entitled to a refund.  \nThe subsequent (amended) return was filed with a tax \nbalance due. \nYou requested that the payments made on your hus-\nband\u2019s account be transferred to your account.  Ap-\npeals is not in a position to move credits from your hus-\nband\u2019s account to your account.  Your request is being \ndenied.  \nAppeals is also not in a position to grant your penalty \nabatement request because you have not demonstrated \n\u201creasonable cause\u201d for abatement.  You claim that you \nwere under duress from your divorce.  Appeals does \nnot agree that you should be granted penalty abatement \nbased upon the aforementioned reasoning. \n \nYou raised no other issues. \nBALANCING ANALYSIS \nAppeals reviewed both your tax payment transfer re-\nquest and your request for penalty abatement.  Ap-\npeals has determined that we cannot transfer any pay-\nments made to husband\u2019s account to your account.  Ap-\npeals has also determined that you do not qualify for \npenalty abatement (reasonable cause). \nTherefore, our determination is that the proposed levy \naction balances the need for efficient collection of taxes \n\n67a \n \nwith the taxpayer\u2019s legitimate concern that any collec-\ntion action be no more intrusive than necessary.  Com-\npliance\u2019s decision to issue the Final Notice of Intent to \nLevy is being sustained by Appeals. \n \n \n \n\n68a \n \nAPPENDIX F \n \nUNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS \nFOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT \n \nNo. 22-2244 \nJENNIFER ZUCH, APPELLANT \nv. \nCOMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE \n \nFiled:  June 26, 2024 \n \nOn Appeal from the United States Tax Court \n(IRS 1:14-25125) \nTax Court Judge:  Honorable Lewis R.

Without this, my analysis would be one-sided and incomplete, relying only on the petitioner's framing of the case. The respondent's brief will directly counter the government's claims and provide the legal foundation for a ruling in Zuch's favor, allowing me to assess the relative strengths of each side's case.\n\nDesign EIG is moderate (0.4). The action of retrieving a primary party's merits brief is a fundamental and standard step in any SCOTUS prediction methodology. While executing this step successfully reinforces the validity of this core strategy, it doesn't necessarily reveal a novel or more effective *method* for prediction. It's more about gathering the necessary data for the established process rather than refining the process itself. However, analyzing the content and structure of the brief provides a valuable data point for the general model of how to weigh and synthesize competing legal arguments, which has some design-level value.\n\nThe joint EIG is high because the immense value of this information for the specific task outweighs the more modest contribution to general strategy.",

See I.R.C. \u00a7 6330. At the hearing, the \ntaxpayer may raise \u201cany relevant issue relating to the \nunpaid \ntax \nor \nthe \nproposed \nlevy.\u201d \nI.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A). The taxpayer may also challenge her \nunderlying tax liability if she did not previously have \nan opportunity to do so. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B). The Ap-\npeals Office issues a \u201cdetermination,\u201d which \u201cshall \ntake into consideration\u201d \u201cthe issues raised under par-\nagraph (2),\u201d including any challenge relating to the \nunpaid tax or the taxpayer\u2019s liability. I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(c)(3). After the Appeals Office renders its de-\ntermination, the taxpayer may \u201cpetition the Tax Court \nfor review of such determination,\u201d \u201cand the Tax Court \nshall have jurisdiction with respect to such matter.\u201d \nI.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). \nThe question presented is whether the Tax Court \nretains jurisdiction under I.R.C. \u00a7 6330 to review the \nAppeals Office\u2019s determination of the taxpayer\u2019s un-\npaid tax or underlying liability when, despite the \nparties\u2019 live dispute about that issue, the IRS stops \npursuing the levy, because it instead keeps the tax-\npayer\u2019s overpayments for later tax years. \n \n \n\nii \n \n \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDINGS AND \nRELATED PROCEEDINGS \nPetitioner\u2019s lists of the parties to the proceeding \nand directly related proceedings are complete and cor-\nrect. \n\niii \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \nQUESTION PRESENTED ........................................... i \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDINGS AND \nRELATED PROCEEDINGS ................................ ii \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES ....................................... vi \nINTRODUCTION ........................................................ 1 \nSTATEMENT .............................................................. 6 \nA.

Miller, \nFederal Practice and Procedure \n(3d ed. updated June 2024) ................................... 30 \n \n\n1 \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThis case is about whether the Tax Court retains \njurisdiction to review an IRS administrative decision \ndetermining a taxpayer\u2019s disputed liability or unpaid \ntax after the IRS unilaterally tries to moot the chal-\nlenge by terminating its efforts to levy the taxpayer\u2019s \nproperty. The answer is yes. The Tax Court has juris-\ndiction under Internal Revenue Code \u00a7 6330(d)(1) to \nreview the Appeals Office\u2019s determination and the \nmatters and issues that determination resolves, and \nnothing in \u00a7 6330 conditions that jurisdiction on the \nIRS\u2019s continuing pursuit of a levy. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1); \nsee I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c). The Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to re-\nview the Appeals Office\u2019s determination thus gives the \ncourt authority to rule on the taxpayer\u2019s unpaid tax or \nunderlying liability. And because the government is \nexpected to abide by judicial rulings, those rulings \nwould redress Zuch\u2019s pocketbook injury. This case is \nnot moot. \nJennifer Zuch owed about $27,000 for the 2010 tax \nyear. But she and her ex-husband had already made \n$50,000 in estimated payments to the IRS for the 2010 \ntax year, and Zuch asked the IRS to apply those pay-\nments to her tax bill. Zuch\u2019s ex-husband agreed that \nthose tax payments should be applied to Zuch\u2019s tax \nbill. But the IRS refused. Instead, it applied the full \n$50,000 in estimated payments to Zuch\u2019s ex-husband\u2019s \nbalance. It then threatened to seize Zuch\u2019s property to \ncollect her 2010 tax assessment. \nZuch exercised her right to a hearing under \n\u00a7 6330, which provides taxpayers with procedural pro-\ntections before the IRS may levy their property to \ncollect taxes. Congress enacted \u00a7 6330 as part of the \nInternal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform \n\n2 \n \n \nAct in response to abusive IRS collections practices \nthat forced some taxpayers to spend their life\u2019s sav-\nings on taxes the IRS or courts later determined they \nnever even owed. Practices & Procedures of the Inter-\nnal Revenue Service: Hearings Before the Committee \non Finance, 105th Cong., S. Hrg. 105-190 at 75-82 \n(1997) [hereinafter Hearings Before the Committee on \nFinance] (statement of Katherine Lund Hicks). Sec-\ntion 6330 ensures that taxpayers can dispute their tax \nbill before having to pay. The provision allows taxpay-\ners threatened with a levy to initiate administrative \nhearings before the Appeals Office and to raise \u201cany \nrelevant issue relating to the unpaid tax\u201d or challenge \ntheir liability if they haven\u2019t yet had a chance to do so. \nI.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2). Section 6330 also grants taxpayers \nan opportunity for meaningful judicial review by \ngranting the Tax Court jurisdiction to review the Ap-\npeals Office\u2019s determination. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). \nAt her administrative hearing, Zuch argued that \nthe IRS should have credited her with the $50,000 in \nestimated payments that she and her ex-husband had \nmade. Those payments would have covered her 2010 \ntax bill and entitled her to a refund. The Appeals Of-\nfice disagreed, concluding that Zuch was not entitled \nto any portion of the estimated payments and uphold-\ning the proposed levy. Zuch petitioned the Tax Court \nfor review of the Appeals Office\u2019s determination. But \nduring the course of the Tax Court proceedings, the \nIRS kept overpayments that Zuch made for later tax \nyears and used them to offset her disputed 2010 lia-\nbility. By 2019, after six years of litigation, the IRS \nclaimed that Zuch had satisfied the disputed liability, \nand it moved to dismiss the Tax Court proceedings as \nmoot. \n\n3 \n \n \nThe Tax Court agreed and dismissed the petition. \nAccording to the court, because there was no unpaid \nliability and no levy, the case was moot. Pet. App. 43a. \nThe court of appeals vacated and remanded. In a \npart of the opinion joined by two panel members, the \ncourt held that the case was not moot because the Tax \nCourt had jurisdiction to review the Appeals Office\u2019s \ndetermination of and declare Zuch\u2019s liability. Pet. \nApp. 25a-26a; see Pet. App. 25a-38a. And a declara-\ntory judgment, the court concluded, would redress \nZuch\u2019s injury. Pet. App. 37a-38a. \nThe court of appeals correctly recognized that the \nTax Court had jurisdiction to review the Appeals Of-\nfice\u2019s determination and that this case is not moot. \nThis Court should affirm. \n1. a. The Tax Court had, and retained, jurisdic-\ntion to review the Appeals Office\u2019s determination. \nSection 6330\u2019s plain text states that the Tax Court \n\u201cshall have jurisdiction\u201d to \u201creview\u201d the Appeals Of-\nfice\u2019s \u201cdetermination,\u201d including its resolution of \u201cany \nrelevant issue relating to the unpaid tax,\u201d or the tax-\npayer\u2019s \u201cunderlying tax liability.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2), \n(c)(3), (d)(1). Nothing in that language, or anything \nelse in \u00a7 6330, requires an ongoing attempt to levy the \ntaxpayer\u2019s property. Thus, the Tax Court retains ju-\nrisdiction \nto \nreview \nthe \nAppeals \nOffice\u2019s \ndetermination, even if the IRS stops pursuing a levy, \nso long as the taxpayer continues to dispute her un-\npaid tax or underlying liability. That makes sense, \ngiven that the whole point of \u00a7 6330 is to make sure \nthat levy proceedings are fair and that a taxpayer can \nchallenge her liability if she had no prior opportunity \nto do so. Indeed, the very design of \u00a7 6330 seeks to en-\nsure that the government is \u201cturn[ing] square corners \n\n4 \n \n \nin dealing with the people,\u201d Department of Homeland \nSecurity v. Regents of the University of California, 591 \nU.S. 1, 24 (2020).  \nb. This case is not moot. The Tax Court had au-\nthority to determine Zuch\u2019s entitlement to the \nprepayments. See I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). A case is moot \nonly when the parties no longer retain any interest in \nthe outcome of the proceedings. But here, both parties \nhave a concrete interest in the outcome of the litiga-\ntion: If Zuch wins, the IRS will likely refund her \nmoney. If the IRS wins, it will keep her money. Either \nway, the Tax Court\u2019s ruling will be preclusive in a re-\nfund suit\u2014which the government has invited Zuch to \nfile\u2014so the stakes are real. And Zuch has now filed a \nrefund suit in the District of New Jersey seeking to \nrecover some of her overpayments. \n2. The IRS\u2019s counterarguments are meritless. \nThe IRS claims that the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to re-\nview the Appeals Office\u2019s determination vanished, and \nthat the case is moot, because the IRS decided it no \nlonger needed a levy after it took Zuch\u2019s money an-\nother way. The government\u2019s arguments fail.  \nFirst, the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to review \nwhether Zuch was entitled to the prepayments didn\u2019t \ndisappear once the IRS stopped pursuing the levy. \nPlain text makes that clear. Although the term \u201clevy\u201d \nappears throughout \u00a7 6330, the provision that grants \nthe Tax Court jurisdiction over the Appeals Office\u2019s \ndetermination\u2014\u00a7 6330(d)(1)\u2014doesn\u2019t condition juris-\ndiction on a levy. History and purpose don\u2019t help the \ngovernment, either. Congress enacted \u00a7 6330 to rem-\nedy IRS abuses and give taxpayers a fair shot at \ndisputing what they owe before collection, underscor-\ning why Congress likely wanted the Tax Court to \n\n5 \n \n \nretain jurisdiction to resolve disputes over unpaid tax \nand liability. Section 6330 must be construed in light \nof that remedial purpose.  \nInvoking Royal Canin U.S.A., Inc. v. Wullschleger, \n604 U.S. 22 (2025), the government claims that the \nTax Court lost jurisdiction because the IRS fundamen-\ntally altered the basis of the suit when it decided not \nto seek the levy. But again, \u00a7 6330 gave the Tax Court \njurisdiction to review an Appeals Office determination \nand nothing in the provision requires a levy. See I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1). Put differently, \u00a7 6330(d) gives the Tax \nCourt jurisdiction so long as the taxpayer challenges \nan Appeals Office determination. The Court recently \nmade clear in the \u00a7 6330 context that a procedural re-\nquirement is jurisdictional only if Congress \u201cclearly \nstates\u201d that it is. Boechler, P.C. v. Commissioner, 596 \nU.S. 199, 203 (2022). But the word \u201clevy\u201d doesn\u2019t even \nappear in \u00a7 6330(d). In any event, even if \u00a7 6330 re-\nquired a levy, the requirement would look to the time \nof filing, and there was a proposed levy when Zuch pe-\ntitioned the Tax Court.  \nAppealing to policy, the government says that if \nthe Tax Court has jurisdiction to review liability dis-\nputes like Zuch\u2019s, the Tax Court will become a forum \nfor general liability claims. For starters, the govern-\nment hasn\u2019t pointed to any cases showing that \ntaxpayers are invoking \u00a7 6330 to bring general liabil-\nity challenges. Plus, to invoke the Tax Court\u2019s \u00a7 6330 \njurisdiction, a taxpayer needs an Appeals Office deter-\nmination. The Tax Court can address unpaid tax or \nliability issues only if the Appeals Office\u2019s determina-\ntion resolved them. What\u2019s more, the question \npresented in this case rarely arises, and when it does, \nit\u2019s only because the IRS starts levy proceedings, gets \nthe taxpayer\u2019s money another way, and once the Tax \n\n6 \n \n \nCourt is reviewing the determination, decides to aban-\ndon the levy midstream. The IRS can easily avoid its \nself-made problem.  \nSecond, the government asserts that the Tax \nCourt lacks authority to declare Zuch\u2019s entitlement to \nthe prepayments because the Declaratory Judgment \nAct (DJA) and Anti-Injunction Act (AIA) generally \nprohibit courts from issuing declaratory and injunc-\ntive relief in federal tax cases. That argument fails. \nSection 6330(d)(1) authorizes the Tax Court to deter-\nmine the taxpayer\u2019s unpaid tax and underlying \nliability in \u00a7 6330 proceedings. And \u00a7 6330(e)(1) con-\nfirms that the Tax Court can issue declaratory relief, \nexempting \u00a7 6330 proceedings from the DJA\u2019s and \nAIA\u2019s prohibitions on declaratory and injunctive relief \nin other tax cases.  \nFinally, the government claims it mooted the case \nby abandoning the levy because the levy gave rise to \nthe proceeding. But that\u2019s not how moot\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Miller, \nFederal Practice and Procedure \n(3d ed. updated June 2024) ................................... 30 \n \n\n1 \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThis case is about whether the Tax Court retains \njurisdiction to review an IRS administrative decision \ndetermining a taxpayer\u2019s disputed liability or unpaid \ntax after the IRS unilaterally tries to moot the chal-\nlenge by terminating its efforts to levy the taxpayer\u2019s \nproperty. The answer is yes. The Tax Court has juris-\ndiction under Internal Revenue Code \u00a7 6330(d)(1) to \nreview the Appeals Office\u2019s determination and the \nmatters and issues that determination resolves, and \nnothing in \u00a7 6330 conditions that jurisdiction on the \nIRS\u2019s continuing pursuit of a levy. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1); \nsee I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c). The Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to re-\nview the Appeals Office\u2019s determination thus gives the \ncourt authority to rule on the taxpayer\u2019s unpaid tax or \nunderlying liability. And because the government is \nexpected to abide by judicial rulings, those rulings \nwould redress Zuch\u2019s pocketbook injury. This case is \nnot moot. \nJennifer Zuch owed about $27,000 for the 2010 tax \nyear. But she and her ex-husband had already made \n$50,000 in estimated payments to the IRS for the 2010 \ntax year, and Zuch asked the IRS to apply those pay-\nments to her tax bill. Zuch\u2019s ex-husband agreed that \nthose tax payments should be applied to Zuch\u2019s tax \nbill. But the IRS refused. Instead, it applied the full \n$50,000 in estimated payments to Zuch\u2019s ex-husband\u2019s \nbalance. It then threatened to seize Zuch\u2019s property to \ncollect her 2010 tax assessment. \nZuch exercised her right to a hearing under \n\u00a7 6330, which provides taxpayers with procedural pro-\ntections before the IRS may levy their property to \ncollect taxes. Congress enacted \u00a7 6330 as part of the \nInternal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform \n\n2 \n \n \nAct in response to abusive IRS collections practices \nthat forced some taxpayers to spend their life\u2019s sav-\nings on taxes the IRS or courts later determined they \nnever even owed. Practices & Procedures of the Inter-\nnal Revenue Service: Hearings Before the Committee \non Finance, 105th Cong., S. Hrg. 105-190 at 75-82 \n(1997) [hereinafter Hearings Before the Committee on \nFinance] (statement of Katherine Lund Hicks). Sec-\ntion 6330 ensures that taxpayers can dispute their tax \nbill before having to pay. The provision allows taxpay-\ners threatened with a levy to initiate administrative \nhearings before the Appeals Office and to raise \u201cany \nrelevant issue relating to the unpaid tax\u201d or challenge \ntheir liability if they haven\u2019t yet had a chance to do so. \nI.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2). Section 6330 also grants taxpayers \nan opportunity for meaningful judicial review by \ngranting the Tax Court jurisdiction to review the Ap-\npeals Office\u2019s determination. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). \nAt her administrative hearing, Zuch argued that \nthe IRS should have credited her with the $50,000 in \nestimated payments that she and her ex-husband had \nmade. Those payments would have covered her 2010 \ntax bill and entitled her to a refund. The Appeals Of-\nfice disagreed, concluding that Zuch was not entitled \nto any portion of the estimated payments and uphold-\ning the proposed levy. Zuch petitioned the Tax Court \nfor review of the Appeals Office\u2019s determination. But \nduring the course of the Tax Court proceedings, the \nIRS kept overpayments that Zuch made for later tax \nyears and used them to offset her disputed 2010 lia-\nbility. By 2019, after six years of litigation, the IRS \nclaimed that Zuch had satisfied the disputed liability, \nand it moved to dismiss the Tax Court proceedings as \nmoot. \n\n3 \n \n \nThe Tax Court agreed and dismissed the petition. \nAccording to the court, because there was no unpaid \nliability and no levy, the case was moot. Pet. App. 43a. \nThe court of appeals vacated and remanded. In a \npart of the opinion joined by two panel members, the \ncourt held that the case was not moot because the Tax \nCourt had jurisdiction to review the Appeals Office\u2019s \ndetermination of and declare Zuch\u2019s liability. Pet. \nApp. 25a-26a; see Pet. App. 25a-38a. And a declara-\ntory judgment, the court concluded, would redress \nZuch\u2019s injury. Pet. App. 37a-38a. \nThe court of appeals correctly recognized that the \nTax Court had jurisdiction to review the Appeals Of-\nfice\u2019s determination and that this case is not moot. \nThis Court should affirm. \n1. a. The Tax Court had, and retained, jurisdic-\ntion to review the Appeals Office\u2019s determination. \nSection 6330\u2019s plain text states that the Tax Court \n\u201cshall have jurisdiction\u201d to \u201creview\u201d the Appeals Of-\nfice\u2019s \u201cdetermination,\u201d including its resolution of \u201cany \nrelevant issue relating to the unpaid tax,\u201d or the tax-\npayer\u2019s \u201cunderlying tax liability.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2), \n(c)(3), (d)(1). Nothing in that language, or anything \nelse in \u00a7 6330, requires an ongoing attempt to levy the \ntaxpayer\u2019s property. Thus, the Tax Court retains ju-\nrisdiction \nto \nreview \nthe \nAppeals \nOffice\u2019s \ndetermination, even if the IRS stops pursuing a levy, \nso long as the taxpayer continues to dispute her un-\npaid tax or underlying liability. That makes sense, \ngiven that the whole point of \u00a7 6330 is to make sure \nthat levy proceedings are fair and that a taxpayer can \nchallenge her liability if she had no prior opportunity \nto do so. Indeed, the very design of \u00a7 6330 seeks to en-\nsure that the government is \u201cturn[ing] square corners \n\n4 \n \n \nin dealing with the people,\u201d Department of Homeland \nSecurity v. Regents of the University of California, 591 \nU.S. 1, 24 (2020).  \nb. This case is not moot. The Tax Court had au-\nthority to determine Zuch\u2019s entitlement to the \nprepayments. See I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). A case is moot \nonly when the parties no longer retain any interest in \nthe outcome of the proceedings. But here, both parties \nhave a concrete interest in the outcome of the litiga-\ntion: If Zuch wins, the IRS will likely refund her \nmoney. If the IRS wins, it will keep her money. Either \nway, the Tax Court\u2019s ruling will be preclusive in a re-\nfund suit\u2014which the government has invited Zuch to \nfile\u2014so the stakes are real. And Zuch has now filed a \nrefund suit in the District of New Jersey seeking to \nrecover some of her overpayments. \n2. The IRS\u2019s counterarguments are meritless. \nThe IRS claims that the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to re-\nview the Appeals Office\u2019s determination vanished, and \nthat the case is moot, because the IRS decided it no \nlonger needed a levy after it took Zuch\u2019s money an-\nother way. The government\u2019s arguments fail.  \nFirst, the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to review \nwhether Zuch was entitled to the prepayments didn\u2019t \ndisappear once the IRS stopped pursuing the levy. \nPlain text makes that clear. Although the term \u201clevy\u201d \nappears throughout \u00a7 6330, the provision that grants \nthe Tax Court jurisdiction over the Appeals Office\u2019s \ndetermination\u2014\u00a7 6330(d)(1)\u2014doesn\u2019t condition juris-\ndiction on a levy. History and purpose don\u2019t help the \ngovernment, either. Congress enacted \u00a7 6330 to rem-\nedy IRS abuses and give taxpayers a fair shot at \ndisputing what they owe before collection, underscor-\ning why Congress likely wanted the Tax Court to \n\n5 \n \n \nretain jurisdiction to resolve disputes over unpaid tax \nand liability. Section 6330 must be construed in light \nof that remedial purpose.  \nInvoking Royal Canin U.S.A., Inc. v. Wullschleger, \n604 U.S. 22 (2025), the government claims that the \nTax Court lost jurisdiction because the IRS fundamen-\ntally altered the basis of the suit when it decided not \nto seek the levy. But again, \u00a7 6330 gave the Tax Court \njurisdiction to review an Appeals Office determination \nand nothing in the provision requires a levy. See I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1). Put differently, \u00a7 6330(d) gives the Tax \nCourt jurisdiction so long as the taxpayer challenges \nan Appeals Office determination. The Court recently \nmade clear in the \u00a7 6330 context that a procedural re-\nquirement is jurisdictional only if Congress \u201cclearly \nstates\u201d that it is. Boechler, P.C. v. Commissioner, 596 \nU.S. 199, 203 (2022). But the word \u201clevy\u201d doesn\u2019t even \nappear in \u00a7 6330(d). In any event, even if \u00a7 6330 re-\nquired a levy, the requirement would look to the time \nof filing, and there was a proposed levy when Zuch pe-\ntitioned the Tax Court.  \nAppealing to policy, the government says that if \nthe Tax Court has jurisdiction to review liability dis-\nputes like Zuch\u2019s, the Tax Court will become a forum \nfor general liability claims. For starters, the govern-\nment hasn\u2019t pointed to any cases showing that \ntaxpayers are invoking \u00a7 6330 to bring general liabil-\nity challenges. Plus, to invoke the Tax Court\u2019s \u00a7 6330 \njurisdiction, a taxpayer needs an Appeals Office deter-\nmination. The Tax Court can address unpaid tax or \nliability issues only if the Appeals Office\u2019s determina-\ntion resolved them. What\u2019s more, the question \npresented in this case rarely arises, and when it does, \nit\u2019s only because the IRS starts levy proceedings, gets \nthe taxpayer\u2019s money another way, and once the Tax \n\n6 \n \n \nCourt is reviewing the determination, decides to aban-\ndon the levy midstream. The IRS can easily avoid its \nself-made problem.  \nSecond, the government asserts that the Tax \nCourt lacks authority to declare Zuch\u2019s entitlement to \nthe prepayments because the Declaratory Judgment \nAct (DJA) and Anti-Injunction Act (AIA) generally \nprohibit courts from issuing declaratory and injunc-\ntive relief in federal tax cases. That argument fails. \nSection 6330(d)(1) authorizes the Tax Court to deter-\nmine the taxpayer\u2019s unpaid tax and underlying \nliability in \u00a7 6330 proceedings. And \u00a7 6330(e)(1) con-\nfirms that the Tax Court can issue declaratory relief, \nexempting \u00a7 6330 proceedings from the DJA\u2019s and \nAIA\u2019s prohibitions on declaratory and injunctive relief \nin other tax cases.  \nFinally, the government claims it mooted the case \nby abandoning the levy because the levy gave rise to \nthe proceeding. But that\u2019s not how mootness works. \nThe question is whether the parties retain any inter-\nest in the outcome of the litigation. And here, both \nZuch and the IRS have a concrete interest in whether \nand how the Tax Court adjudicates Zuch\u2019s entitlement \nto the estimated payments. \nThe Court should affirm the court of appeals\u2019 de-\ncision and remand so the Tax Court can consider \nZuch\u2019s merits arguments. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal background \n1. Taxpayers often have various ways to dispute \nthe amount of income taxes and other taxes the IRS \nclaims they owe. If the IRS determines that a taxpayer \nowes more taxes than she reported on her tax return, \n\n7 \n \n \nthe IRS typically sends her a notice of deficiency. \nI.R.C. \u00a7 6212(a). Within 90 days, the taxpayer may \nchallenge the claimed deficiency in Tax Court. I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6213(a). In the deficiency proceeding, the Tax Court \ncan determine the correct amount of tax owed and \nwhether the taxpayer made overpayments, entitling \nthe taxpayer to a refund or credit. I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6214(a), \n6512(b)(1). The Tax Court\u2019s final decision is reviewa-\nble by a court of appeals. I.R.C. \u00a7 7482(a)(1). If the \ntaxpayer does not challenge the deficiency, she can \npay the disputed amount and seek a refund in district \ncourt or the Court of Federal Claims. 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1346(a)(1); see I.R.C. \u00a7 7422(a).  \n2. This case centers on a third way a taxpayer \ncan challenge the taxes the IRS assesses when the \ntaxpayer has not paid the taxes the IRS claims she \nowes and the IRS seeks to collect by levying the tax-\npayer\u2019s property. Sometimes, a tax remains unpaid \neven after a taxpayer receives a notice of deficiency. \nOr perhaps a taxpayer hasn\u2019t paid the amount the IRS \nclaims she owes, but she didn\u2019t receive a notice of de-\nficiency or otherwise have an opportunity to dispute \nher liability. In either situation, the IRS may decide \nto pursue a levy on the taxpayer\u2019s property. I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6331(a), (b). \nIf the IRS issues a levy notice, the taxpayer has 30 \ndays to request an administrative hearing before the \nAppeals Office under I.R.C. \u00a7 6330, sometimes called \na \u201ccollection due process\u201d hearing, to challenge the \nproposed levy and her underlying tax liability. I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(b), (c)(2)(B); see Boechler, 596 U.S. at 202; \nByers v. Commissioner, 740 F.3d 668, 671-72 (D.C. \nCir. 2014). This case involves a \u00a7 6330 proceeding in \nwhich the parties dispute the taxpayer\u2019s liability and \nunpaid tax.  \n\n8 \n \n \na. The issues a taxpayer may raise in a collection \ndue process hearing depend in part on whether the \ntaxpayer received a notice of deficiency or had another \nopportunity to dispute her liability. If she did not, she \nmay raise \u201cchallenges to the existence or amount\u201d of \nher liability. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B). A collection due \nprocess hearing thus serves as a backstop, ensuring \nthat a taxpayer has an opportunity to dispute her un-\nderlying tax liability because she was not able to do so \nearlier. Liability challenges aside, all taxpayers in col-\nlection due process proceedings may raise \u201cany \nrelevant issue relating to the unpaid tax or the pro-\nposed levy, including\u201d \u201cappropriate spousal defenses,\u201d \n\u201cchallenges to the appropriateness of collection ac-\ntions,\u201d and \u201coffers of collection alternatives,\u201d no \nmatter whether they had an earlier opportunity to dis-\npute their liability. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A). The Appeals \nOffice then makes a \u201cdetermination\u201d that \u201cshall take \ninto consideration\u201d the taxpayer\u2019s challenge to the un-\npaid tax, her underlying liability, and any other issues \nraised. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(3). \nAlthough it is an important backstop, a collection \ndue process hearing \u201clacks the typical hallmarks of a \njudicial hearing\u201d and is \u201cfar from \u2026 a formal hearing.\u201d \nFarhy v. Commissioner, 100 F.4th 223, 227 (D.C. Cir. \n2024). \u201cThere are no formal discovery procedures, and \nthe taxpayer has no right to subpoena documents or \nwitnesses.\u201d Id. Rather, the hearing \u201cprovides the tax-\npayer \u2018an opportunity for an informal oral or written \nconversation with the IRS.\u2019\u201d Id. \nAfter the Appeals Office issues its \u201cdetermina-\ntion,\u201d the taxpayer may \u201cpetition the Tax Court for \nreview of such determination (and the Tax Court shall \nhave jurisdiction with respect to such matter).\u201d I.R.C. \n\n9 \n \n \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1). The Tax Court\u2019s final judgment is subject \nto review in a court of appeals. I.R.C. \u00a7 7482(a)(1). \nb. Congress enacted \u00a7 6330 in 1998 to protect \ntaxpayers from the IRS\u2019s abusive tax collection prac-\ntices. E.g., 144 Cong. Rec. S4027-32 (daily ed. May 1, \n1998). Leading up to \u00a7 6330\u2019s enactment, Congress \nheld a series of hearings that shed light on those prac-\ntices. For example, taxpayers couldn\u2019t contest a levy \nbefore the IRS seized their property. See Phillips v. \nCommissioner, 283 U.S. 589, 595-96 (1931). And tax-\npayers were often forced to drain their life\u2019s savings\u2014\nand their family\u2019s\u2014to pay assessments they never \neven owed. Hearings Before the Committee on Finance \nat 75-82 (statement of Katherine Lund Hicks). After \nthe hearings, \u201c[m]any people were shocked to learn \nthat a number of the due-process protections Ameri-\ncans take for granted in other legal proceedings do not \napply to actions involving the IRS.\u201d 144 Cong. Rec. \nS4031 (statement of Sen. Enzi). As one member put it, \n\u201cthe problem is, [the IRS] ha[s] too much power, they \nhave no checks and balances.\u201d Hearings Before the \nCommittee on Finance at 56 (statement of Sen. \nGramm). \nIn designing \u00a7 6330, Congress sought to \u201censure \nthat all taxpayers have due process and that the IRS \ndoes not abusively use its liens-and-seizure author-\nity.\u201d 143 Cong. Rec. S12231 (daily ed. Nov. 9, 1997) \n(statement of Sen. Roth). Indeed, the point of \u00a7 6330 \nproceedings is to \u201cincrease fairness to taxpayers\u201d be-\nfore the IRS deprives them of their property. S. Rep. \nNo. 105-174, at 67 (1998). And, as the Tax Court has \nobserved, Congress sought to ensure that the Commis-\nsioner would \u201ccollect the correct amount of tax, and do \nso by observing all applicable laws and administrative \n\n10 \n \n \nprocedures.\u201d Montgomery v. Commissioner, 122 T.C. \n1, 10 (2004). \nTo that end, \u00a7 6330 allows a taxpayer to raise is-\nsues relating to the unpaid tax and also challenge her \nliability if she did not have an earlier opportunity to \ndo so. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2). Section 6330 also gives the \ntaxpayer a chance \u201cto petition the Tax Court to contest \nthe Appeals [Office\u2019s] decision.\u201d 144 Cong. Rec. S4494 \n(daily ed. May 7, 1998) (statement of Sen. Hatch). And \nonce a taxpayer has petitioned the Tax Court, that \ncourt can enjoin any action or proceeding \u201cin respect \nof the unpaid tax or proposed levy.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(e)(1). \nThat makes sense: ensuring that the IRS is collecting \nthe correct amount of tax requires giving taxpayers an \nopportunity to dispute issues relating to the taxes \nthey haven\u2019t paid and their tax liability, and having \nthe Tax Court weigh in before the IRS can take their \nmoney. \nB. Factual and procedural background \nThis case arises from a dispute over whether the \nIRS properly credited $50,000 in overpayments from \nZuch and her ex-husband, Patrick Gennardo, to Gen-\nnardo\u2019s tax bill rather than Zuch\u2019s in the wake of their \ndivorce. Both Zuch and Gennardo maintain that the \nIRS should have credited Zuch\u2019s account, but the IRS \ninstead credited Gennardo\u2019s, sought to levy Zuch\u2019s \nproperty, and unilaterally decided to withhold over-\npayments Zuch made in later tax years. \n1. Zuch and Gennardo were married from 1993 \nto 2014. Pet. App. 7a. They separated in 2010, and \nZuch initiated divorce proceedings in 2012. CA3 \nApp. A118. During that time, the IRS assessed sub-\nstantial taxes against Zuch and Gennardo, prompting \nyears of litigation. \n\n11 \n \n \na. In 2010 and 2011, Zuch and Gennardo submit-\nted $50,000 in prepayments to the IRS for what they \nestimated would be their 2010 tax liability. Pet. \nApp. 8a. In particular, in June 2010, they submitted \nan estimated payment of $20,000 using a check drawn \nfrom a bank account listing both their names. Pet. \nApp. 8a & n.11. The form accompanying the check also \nlisted both names. Pet. App. 8a n.11, 51a. In January \n2011, Gennardo sent the IRS a check for $30,000. Pet. \nApp. 8a. The subject line of the letter accompanying \nthe check read \u201cRe: Patrick J. Gennardo and Jennifer \nZuch,\u201d and although the check was from Zuch and \nGennardo\u2019s joint bank account, the check listed only \nGennardo\u2019s name. Pet. App. 8a n.12, 51a. At the time, \nZuch and Gennardo didn\u2019t tell the IRS how to allocate \nthe payments. Pet. App. 8a. \nb. In 2012 and 2013, Zuch and Gennardo filed \nuntimely, and later amended, tax returns for 2010, \nand the IRS applied the $50,000 in prepayments to \nGennardo\u2019s, rather than Zuch\u2019s, tax bill. Pet. App. 7a-\n8a. The IRS\u2019s decision gave rise to the parties\u2019 dispute \nover Zuch\u2019s 2010 tax balance. \nIn September 2012, Zuch and Gennardo each filed \na married-filing-separately income tax return. Pet. \nApp. 7a. Zuch\u2019s return showed an adjusted gross in-\ncome of $74,493 and a $731 overpayment, and didn\u2019t \nmention the prepayments from 2010 and 2011. Pet. \nApp. 7a-8a & n.9. Gennardo\u2019s return showed an ad-\njusted gross income of $1,077,213, indicated that he \nowed $385,393 in taxes, and reported $10,000 in esti-\nmated payments. Pet. App. 8a-9a, 52a. The same day \nthat Gennardo filed his return, he also filed an offer-\nin-compromise, seeking to settle his accumulated tax \ndebts at less than the amount due. Id.; see I.R.C. \n\u00a7 7122(a). The IRS later notified him that it had \n\n12 \n \n \napplied the $50,000 in prepayments towards the \n$385,393 in taxes he owed. Pet. App. 8a. \nIn November 2012, Zuch filed an amended return \nfor 2010 to report $71,000 in additional income from a \nretirement account distribution. Pet. App. 9a. Zuch\u2019s \namended return showed that she owed the IRS \n$27,682. Id. She explained that the $50,000 in prepay-\nments should be credited to her and requested a \nrefund of $21,918. Id. In February 2013, the IRS as-\nsessed the additional $27,682 in taxes that Zuch \nreported, but it refused to credit her for the $50,000 or \nissue any refund. Id. \nGennardo also filed an amended return for 2010 \nin November 2012. Pet. App. 52a-53a. On that \namended return, he reported $0 in prepayments. Id. \nSubsequently, in March 2013, while his offer-in-com-\npromise was pending, Gennardo filed a second \namended return for 2010. Pet. App. 9a. He indicated \non that second amended return that the $50,000 in \nprepayments should be credited to Zuch, but the IRS \nstill refused to allocate it to her tax bill. Pet. App. 9a-\n10a; see Pet. App. 55a. \nc. Gennardo later submitted an amended offer-\nin-compromise in which he offered the IRS a signifi-\ncantly larger payment of tax, which the IRS accepted. \nPet. App. 10a. Even though Gennardo had asked the \nIRS to credit the $50,000 to Zuch, the IRS credited the \nentire sum to him. Id. \n2. Zuch never received a notice of deficiency from \nthe IRS. Pet. App. 9a n.13. But in August 2013, the \nIRS notified her that it intended to levy her property \nbecause she had failed to pay her 2010 tax assessment \nand explained that she had 30 days to request a \n\n13 \n \n \ncollection due process hearing before the Appeals Of-\nfice. Pet. App. 10a. \n3. Zuch timely requested a hearing. Id. At the \nhearing, Zuch challenged her \u201cunderlying tax liabil-\nity\u201d because she did not receive a notice of deficiency \nor otherwise have an opportunity to dispute it. I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B); Pet. App. 10a. Zuch argued that the \n$50,000 in prepayments should have been credited to \nher, reducing her tax liability to $0 and entitling her \nto a refund. Pet. App. 10a. \nIn September 2014, the Appeals Office rejected \nZuch\u2019s \u201c[c]hallenges to [her] [l]iability,\u201d Pet. App. 66a, \nand sustained the proposed levy. It told Zuch that it \nwas \u201cnot in a position\u201d to credit her for the $50,000 \nbecause the IRS had credited the money to Gennardo. \nPet. App. 11a. \n4. Zuch petitioned the Tax Court to review the \nAppeals Office\u2019s determination. Id. In particular, she \nsought a ruling that the $50,000 should have been ap-\nplied to her individual tax balance. Id. After the IRS \nmoved for summary judgment, the Tax Court re-\nmanded to the Appeals Office because it wasn\u2019t clear \nwhy the IRS had applied the $50,000 towards Gen-\nnardo\u2019s liability rather than Zuch\u2019s. Pet. App. 11a-\n12a. \n5. In June 2017, the Appeals Office again ruled \nagainst Zuch on the \u201c[i]ssues relating to [her] unpaid \n[underlying] liability,\u201d Pet. App. 48a, and sustained \nthe proposed levy, Pet. App. 12a. It reasoned that the \nlevy \u201cbalance[d] the need for efficient collection of \ntaxes with the taxpayer\u2019s legitimate concern that any \ncollection action be no more intrusive than necessary.\u201d \nCA3 App. A270. \n\n14 \n \n \n6. The case returned to the Tax Court. Pet. \nApp. 12a. Meanwhile, over the course of the six years \nthe \u00a7 6330 proceedings had been pending, Zuch kept \npaying her taxes for later years. In fact, she overpaid. \nBut rather than issuing her refunds, the IRS kept \nZuch\u2019s overpayments and used them to offset her \nclaimed 2010 liability. Pet. App. 12a-13a. The IRS did \nso six times, \u201conce each in 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2019, \nand twice in 2016.\u201d Id. And in April 2019, after the \ncase had returned to the Tax Court, the IRS kept \nZuch\u2019s money a final time to offset the rest of her \nclaimed 2010 tax balance, reducing it to $0. Pet. \nApp. 13a. \nThe IRS then moved to dismiss the Tax Court pro-\nceedings as moot. Id. The Tax Court granted the \nmotion. Id. The Tax Court concluded that it lacked ju-\nrisdiction over the case and that the case was moot \nbecause \u201cthere [was] no unpaid liability \u2026 upon which \na levy could be based,\u201d and the IRS was no longer \nseeking to levy Zuch\u2019s property. Pet. App. 43a. \n7. The Third Circuit vacated the Tax Court\u2019s de-\ncision, held that the Tax Court had jurisdiction under \n\u00a7 6330 to decide Zuch\u2019s challenge to her tax liability or \nunpaid tax, held that the case wasn\u2019t moot, and re-\nmanded for proceedings on the merits. Pet. App. 1a-\n39a. \nThe court first held that the Tax Court had juris-\ndiction to review the Appeals Office\u2019s determination of \nZuch\u2019s liability. Because Zuch had neither received a \nnotice of deficiency nor had an opportunity to contest \nher liability before her collection due process hearing, \nZuch could challenge \u201cthe existence or amount of [her] \nunderlying tax liability\u201d during the hearing. Pet. \nApp. 14a-15a; (quoting I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B)). And, \n\n15 \n \n \nthe court explained, \u201cZuch\u2019s argument that her esti-\nmated tax payments were erroneously allocated to her \nex-husband is a challenge to her underlying tax liabil-\nity under \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B).\u201d Pet. App. 19a. \nThe court of appeals then held that the Tax Court \nhad jurisdiction over Zuch\u2019s challenge, and that Zuch\u2019s \nchallenge was not moot, for two independent reasons. \nPet. App. 19a-38a. First, the court held that Zuch \ncould continue challenging her underlying liability be-\ncause the IRS unlawfully offset it using her \noverpayments in later years. Pet. App. 19a-25a. The \nIRS\u2019s unilateral, illegal actions, the court held, could \nnot moot the case. Pet. App. 25a. Second, in a part of \nthe opinion joined by two panel members, the court \nheld that the Tax Court had jurisdiction to review the \nAppeals Office\u2019s determination of Zuch\u2019s liability and \nissue a declaratory judgment because the parties con-\ntinued to dispute Zuch\u2019s tax liability. Pet. App. 25a-\n26a; see Pet. App. 25a-38a. And a declaratory judg-\nment, the court concluded, would redress Zuch\u2019s \ninjuries. Pet. App. 37a-38a. \n8. The IRS sought rehearing en banc, which the \ncourt of appeals denied. Pet. App. 68a-69a. It then \nsought a writ of certiorari, which this Court granted \non January 10, 2025. \n9. On March 14, 2025, Zuch filed a suit in the \nU.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey seek-\ning refunds for the 2010, 2012, 2013, and 2018 tax \nyears pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(a)(1) and I.R.C. \n\u00a7 7422(a). Compl., Zuch v. United States, No. 2:25-cv-\n01900 (D.N.J. Mar. 14, 2025). If successful, Zuch will \nrecover approximately two-thirds of the taxes the IRS \ncollected after it refused to credit her for the estimated \npayments. See Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 108-09. But Zuch is unable \n\n16 \n \n \nto request the return of approximately $20,000 in \noverpayments the IRS kept from the 2014 and 2015 \ntax years, due to the onerous jurisdictional prerequi-\nsites to filing a refund suit. Compl. \u00b6 109. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI. \nThe Tax Court had jurisdiction to review \nZuch\u2019s challenge relating to her unpaid tax or under-\nlying tax liability, and to adjudicate her entitlement \nto the estimated payments. The Tax Court retained \nthat jurisdiction and authority to issue a binding rul-\ning even after the IRS stopped pursuing the levy. This \ncase isn\u2019t moot.  \nA.  The Tax Court had, and retained, jurisdiction \nto review the Appeals Office\u2019s determination of Zuch\u2019s \nestimated payment dispute. \n1. Section 6330\u2019s plain text makes clear that the \nTax Court has authority to review the Appeals Office\u2019s \ndetermination of a taxpayer\u2019s challenge relating to her \nunpaid tax or underlying liability. Section 6330 pro-\nvides that a taxpayer may raise \u201cany relevant issue \nrelating to the unpaid tax\u201d at a collection due process \nhearing, and also may raise a challenge to her \u201cunder-\nlying tax liability\u201d when she didn\u2019t have an \nopportunity to do so before. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2). The \nAppeals Office\u2019s \u201cdetermination\u201d must \u201ctake [those is-\nsues] into consideration,\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(3), and the \nTax Court \u201cshall have jurisdiction\u201d to review that de-\ntermination, I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). Nothing in those \nprovisions makes jurisdiction turn on a continuing-\nlevy requirement, much less satisfies the requirement \nthat jurisdictional prerequisites be clearly stated, see \nBoechler, 596 U.S. at 203. The Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction \nunder \u00a7 6330 thus doesn\u2019t vanish when the IRS stops \npursuing a levy. \n\n17 \n \n \n2.  Context confirms that Congress gave the Tax \nCourt continuing jurisdiction under \u00a7 6330 to review \nAppeals Office determinations, including their resolu-\ntion of unpaid tax and tax liability issues. Section \n6330(c)(2)(B) ensures that a taxpayer has a chance to \nchallenge the unpaid tax and her underlying liability \nbefore she must pay or face a levy, and without initi-\nating new litigation against the federal government to \nseek a refund, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(a)(1); I.R.C. \n\u00a7 7422(a).  \n3.  The Tax Court had jurisdiction to review the \nAppeals Office\u2019s determination, including Zuch\u2019s enti-\ntlement to the estimated payments. In proceedings \nbefore the Appeals Office, Zuch challenged the IRS\u2019s \nrefusal to apply the estimated payments to her tax \nbill. The Appeals Office rejected her arguments. Zuch \nthen petitioned the Tax Court for review of the Ap-\npeals Office\u2019s determination\u2014including its resolution \nof the unpaid tax or underlying liability dispute. And \nthe Tax Court had jurisdiction under \u00a7 6330 to review \nthe determination of those issues.  \nB. Zuch\u2019s case wasn\u2019t mooted when the IRS de-\ncided that it no longer needed the levy. A case is moot \nonly if the parties no longer have a concrete interest \nin the outcome, and the court can\u2019t issue any relief \nthat would redress a party\u2019s injury. But here, the Tax \nCourt could issue a ruling deciding whether Zuch is \nentitled to have the $50,000 in estimated payments \napplied to her tax bill. So both parties have an interest \nhere. If Zuch prevails, the IRS is likely to issue a re-\nfund, and if the government prevails, the IRS will \nkeep her money. And win or lose, a judgment from the \nTax Court will be preclusive in the refund suit that \nZuch has now filed in the U.S. District Court for the \nDistrict of New Jersey. \n\n18 \n \n \nII. The government\u2019s counterarguments are un-\npersuasive.  \nA. The government claims that the Tax Court\u2019s \njurisdiction to review a taxpayer\u2019s liability challenge \nrequires a continuing attempt to levy the taxpayer\u2019s \nproperty. That is incorrect\u2014the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdic-\ntion didn\u2019t disappear once the IRS no longer needed \nthe levy. \n1. There is no textual basis for the government\u2019s \ncontinuing-levy requirement. To be sure, \u00a7 6330 men-\ntions the word \u201clevy\u201d\u2014after all, a taxpayer can initiate \nadministrative collection due process proceedings be-\nfore the Appeals Office only after being notified that \nthe IRS is going to levy her property. See I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(a)(3)(B), (b)(1). But once the Appeals Office is-\nsues a determination, the taxpayer can seek Tax \nCourt review of the determination under \u00a7 6330(d)(1). \nSection 6330(d)(1)\u2019s plain terms impose no continuing-\nlevy requirement, much less a \u201cclearly state[d]\u201d juris-\ndictional requirement, Boechler, 596 U.S. at 203. \nWhat\u2019s more, the presumption favoring judicial re-\nview of agency actions supports reading \u00a7 6330(d)(1) \nto confer jurisdiction even if the government abandons \nits levy efforts. See Guerrero-Lasprilla v. Barr, 589 \nU.S. 221, 229 (2020). In arguing otherwise, what the \nIRS is really saying is that, in its view, the Tax Court \ncannot redress a taxpayer\u2019s pocketbook injury when \nthere is no pending levy. But that\u2019s not the case, ei-\nther, as this case makes plain.  \n2. Section 6330\u2019s history and purpose confirm \nthat the Tax Court retains jurisdiction over an unpaid \ntax or liability challenge even after the IRS says it \ndoesn\u2019t need a levy anymore. Congress crafted \u00a7 6330 \nas remedial legislation in response to the IRS\u2019s \n\n19 \n \n \nabusive collection practices as part of a statutory \nscheme to increase fairness to taxpayers by allowing \nthem to challenge what they owe before they pay or \nhave their property seized. In light of that remedial \npurpose, \u00a7 6330 should be construed to mean what it \nsays\u2014the Tax Court has jurisdiction over the Appeals \nOffice\u2019s \u201cdetermination.\u201d \n3. Royal Canin doesn\u2019t suggest otherwise. The \ngovernment argues that the IRS fundamentally al-\ntered the basis of the suit when it decided not to seek \nthe levy. But the basis of the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction \nis the Appeals Office\u2019s determination, not any levy. \nAnd decisions holding that jurisdiction depends on the \nstate of play at the time the suit is brought show that \neven assuming \u00a7 6330 contains a pending-levy re-\nquirement, that requirement turns on the time of \nfiling and thus is met here: there was a levy pending \nwhen Zuch petitioned the Tax Court. \n4.  Policy can\u2019t salvage the government\u2019s position, \neither. The government claims that, if the Tax Court \nhas jurisdiction to review a taxpayer\u2019s liability in a \n\u00a7 6330 proceeding after the IRS determines it no \nlonger needs the levy, the floodgates will open and \n\u00a7 6330 proceedings will become a forum for all kinds \nof liability challenges. But the taxpayer may raise a \nliability issue in a collection due process proceeding \nonly when she did not have an earlier opportunity to \ndo so. Plus, the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction is tied to the \nissues raised before, and determined by, the Appeals \nOffice in the first place. There\u2019s no risk that the Tax \nCourt will begin exercising free-wheeling jurisdiction \nover \u201cgeneral\u201d liability disputes. What\u2019s more, the \nquestion presented rarely arises, and when it does, it\u2019s \nonly because of \u201cthe IRS\u2019s own recalcitrance.\u201d \nBoechler, 596 U.S. at 207. So even if there were a \n\n20 \n \n \nfloodgates problem, it would be the government\u2019s own \ndoing. \nB. The government claims that the Tax Court \nlacks authority to issue a judgment regarding Zuch\u2019s \nentitlement to the estimated payments. In the govern-\nment\u2019s view, the Tax Court can enjoin only a collection \naction in a \u00a7 6330 proceeding, and can\u2019t issue declara-\ntory relief at all. That argument is meritless. \nSection 6330(d)(1) authorizes the Tax Court to deter-\nmine the taxpayer\u2019s unpaid tax and underlying \nliability, and issue a judgment about those issues. And \n\u00a7 6330(e)(1), which allows injunctions \u201cin respect of \nthe unpaid tax or proposed levy,\u201d confirms that the \nTax Court can issue declaratory relief determining a \ntaxpayer\u2019s rights in a challenge involving her liability \nor unpaid tax. The DJA doesn\u2019t provide otherwise, be-\ncause \u00a7 6330(e)(1) exempts \u00a7 6330 from the DJA\u2019s \nprohibition on declaratory relief in most tax cases.  \nC. The government\u2019s other mootness arguments \nfail, too. The government contends that the case is \nmoot because, once the IRS decides not to pursue a \nlevy, \u201cthe issue that prompted the Section 6330 pro-\nceeding is no longer \u2018live.\u2019\u201d Br. 21. But the mootness \ninquiry asks whether the parties retain any interest \nin the outcome of the litigation, and thus whether the \ncourt can redress the plaintiff\u2019s injury. The parties \nhave a concrete interest here, because the Tax Court \ncan decide whether Zuch or the IRS is entitled to the \nmoney.  \nD. Finally, the government mentions in a foot-\nnote that Zuch\u2019s challenge relates to her unpaid tax, \nrather than her underlying liability. But the govern-\nment concedes (Br. 25 n.3) that the dispute is \n\n21 \n \n \nimmaterial. Indeed, as Zuch has explained, the Tax \nCourt had, and retained, jurisdiction either way. \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe Tax Court had jurisdiction under I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330 to review and rule on Zuch\u2019s unpaid \ntax or tax liability, so the case isn\u2019t moot. \nA. The Tax Court had jurisdiction to review \nthe Appeals Office\u2019s determination of \nZuch\u2019s entitlement to the estimated \npayments. \nSection 6330\u2019s text and context make clear that \nthe Tax Court had jurisdiction to review Zuch\u2019s chal-\nlenge to her unpaid tax or underlying tax liability, \neven after the IRS stopped pursuing the levy. \n1. Section 6330\u2019s plain text states that \nthe Tax Court has jurisdiction to \nreview \nthe \nAppeals \nOffice\u2019s \n\u201cdetermination\u201d \nof \na \ntaxpayer\u2019s \nchallenge to \u201cany relevant issue \nrelating to [her] unpaid tax\u201d or her \n\u201cunderlying liability.\u201d  \na. During the collection due process hearing, the \nAppeals Office can determine \u201cany relevant issue re-\nlating to the unpaid tax,\u201d and, if the taxpayer \u201cdid not \nreceive any statutory notice of deficiency \u2026 or did not \notherwise have an opportunity to dispute\u201d it, the tax-\npayer may also challenge \u201cthe existence or amount of \nthe underlying tax liability.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2). A tax-\npayer challenges her underlying tax liability by \ndisputing \u201cthe amounts that the Commissioner as-\nsessed for a particular tax period.\u201d Jeffers v. \nCommissioner, 992 F.3d 649, 653 n.4 (7th Cir. 2021); \naccord Montgomery, 122 T.C. at 7-8. For example, the \n\n22 \n \n \ntaxpayer challenges her underlying tax liability when \nshe claims that the IRS misapplied a credit, if properly \napplying the credit \u201cwould eliminate the outstanding \ntax liability.\u201d Peoplease, LLC v. Commissioner, \nNo. 2161-24L, 2025 WL 429626, at *2 (T.C. Feb. 6, \n2025). Similarly, when a taxpayer raises challenges \nrelating to the unpaid portion of the underlying tax \nliability, she raises an issue related to the unpaid tax. \nSee Internal Revenue Service Chief Counsel Notice \nCC-2014-002 at 3 (May 5, 2014) (\u201c\u2018Unpaid tax\u2019 refers \nto that part of the underlying tax liability not paid by \nthe taxpayer.\u201d).  \nOnce the Appeals Office issues a determination, \nthe taxpayer may \u201cpetition the Tax Court for review \nof [the Appeals Office\u2019s] determination,\u201d \u201cand the Tax \nCourt shall have jurisdiction with respect to such mat-\nter.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). That means the Tax Court \nreviews the \u201cdetermination\u201d of all \u201cthe issues\u201d raised \nduring the hearing. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2), (c)(3)(B). So \nwhen the Tax Court reviews the Appeals Office\u2019s de-\ntermination, it can resolve any dispute about any \nissue relating to the unpaid tax or the taxpayer\u2019s un-\nderlying tax liability that the taxpayer properly raised \nbefore the Appeals Office. See id. \nb. The Tax Court doesn\u2019t lose its jurisdiction to \nresolve a challenge to the Appeals Office determina-\ntion just because the IRS decides to stop pursuing the \nlevy. Congress provided that the Tax Court \u201cshall \nhave jurisdiction\u201d to review the Appeals Office\u2019s deter-\nmination. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1) (emphasis added). That \nreview necessarily reaches all live \u201cissues\u201d involved in \nthe Appeal\u2019s Office\u2019s determination. And those issues \nexpressly include, as relevant here, \u201cany relevant is-\nsue relating to the unpaid tax\u201d and any \u201cchallenges to \nthe existence or amount of the underlying tax \n\n23 \n \n \nliability,\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2), (c)(3)(B). So long as an \nunpaid tax or liability issue remains disputed, nothing \nin \u00a7 6330 suggests the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to re-\nview the question vanishes when the IRS collects the \namount due another way and no longer needs the levy. \nAt most, whether there is a pending levy could affect \nwhat kind of relief the Tax Court can grant. But it \ndoesn\u2019t present any question about jurisdiction under \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1). As explained below (at 28-29), the Tax \nCourt can rule on a taxpayer\u2019s unpaid tax or underly-\ning liability when there are live disputes about those \nissues. \nc. Section 6330\u2019s history confirms that Congress \ndeliberately vested the Tax Court with jurisdiction to \nresolve disputes over a taxpayer\u2019s underlying liability \nand wanted the Tax Court to retain that jurisdiction. \nBefore 2006, \u00a7 6330 provided that taxpayers could \nseek review of the Appeals Office\u2019s determination in \nfederal district court \u201cif the Tax Court [did] not have \njurisdiction of the underlying tax liability.\u201d I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1) (2000). Practically, that language meant \nthat the Tax Court had jurisdiction to review the Ap-\npeals Office\u2019s determination of a liability dispute only \nif the dispute concerned income, estate, or gift taxes, \nbecause the Tax Court already had jurisdiction to re-\nview those kinds of disputes in deficiency proceedings. \nMoore v. Commissioner, 114 T.C. 171, 175 (2000). But \nCongress changed that in 2006 and made clear that \nthe Tax Court \u201cshall\u201d review the taxpayer\u2019s disputed \nliability in all cases. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). Thus, Con-\ngress ensured that \u201cthe Tax Court [has] jurisdiction \nover issues arising from a collection due process hear-\ning\u201d by \u201cconsolidat[ing] all judicial review of \u2026 \ncollection due process determinations,\u201d including a \ntaxpayer\u2019s underlying tax liability, in the Tax Court. \n\n24 \n \n \nStaff of J. Comm. on Taxation, 109th Cong., Descrip-\ntion of the Revenue Provisions Contained in the \nPresident\u2019s Fiscal Year 2007 Budget Proposal 230-31 \n(Comm. Print 2006); accord Staff of J. Comm. On Tax-\nation, 109th Cong., Technical Explanation of H.R. 4, \nThe \u201cPension Protection Act of 2006,\u201d as Passed By the \nHouse on July 28, 2006, and as Considered by the Sen-\nate on August 3, 2006 (Comm. Print. 2006). \n2. Statutory \ncontext \nconfirms \nthat \nCongress \ngave \nthe \nTax \nCourt \ncontinuing jurisdiction to resolve \nissues relating to the unpaid tax and \ntax liability disputes. \nStatutory context shows why Congress likely gave \nthe Tax Court authority to review the issues underly-\ning the Appeals Office\u2019s determination. \nAs noted (at 6-7), in some circumstances, the IRS \nissues a notice of deficiency to a taxpayer, who can \nthen challenge her assessed liability in Tax Court be-\nfore the IRS collects. See I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6212(a), 6512(a). \nBut sometimes the taxpayer doesn\u2019t receive a notice of \ndeficiency or have another opportunity to dispute the \nliability before the IRS seeks to levy the taxpayer\u2019s \nproperty, as in Zuch\u2019s case. See I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B). \nTo ensure that taxpayers have that opportunity, Con-\ngress gave taxpayers the right to dispute their \nliability. Id. Similarly, Congress gave taxpayers the \nright to raise \u201cany relevant issue relating to the un-\npaid tax,\u201d no matter whether they received a notice of \ndeficiency or otherwise had the opportunity to chal-\nlenge the liability. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A). And \nCongress directed the Appeals Office and Tax Court to \nresolve those challenges. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(3), (d)(1). \n\n25 \n \n \nEven if the IRS is able to terminate the levy after \nthe taxpayer initiates \u00a7 6330 proceedings, it makes \nsense for the Tax Court to finish resolving the unpaid \ntax or underlying liability dispute if it remains live. \nAfter all, if the dispute continues past the levy, closing \nthe Tax Court\u2019s doors would simply require the tax-\npayer to file another lawsuit, this time seeking a \nrefund under I.R.C. \u00a7 7422 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(a)(1). \nAnd that would undermine the \u201cdesign[]\u201d of the Tax \nCode \u201cto insure an orderly administration of the reve-\nnue.\u2019\u201d United States v. Clintwood Elkhorn Mining Co., \n553 U.S. 1, 11 (2008). It also would contravene the \ngovernment\u2019s fundamental obligation to \u201cturn square \ncorners in dealing with the people,\u201d Regents of the Uni-\nversity of California, 591 U.S. at 24, by pulling the rug \nout from under a taxpayer who has been litigating \nagainst the IRS for years and forcing her to start new \nlitigation in a different forum.  \nCongress passed \u00a7 6330 to avoid heavy-handed \nIRS tactics, not authorize them in the form of jurisdic-\ntional gamesmanship. And in what is known as the \nTaxpayer Bill of Rights, Congress has also instructed \nthe IRS to \u201censure that employees of the Internal Rev-\nenue Service are familiar with and act in accord with \ntaxpayer rights as afforded by other provisions of this \ntitle.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 7803(a)(3); see Taxpayer Bill of Rights, \nIRS, https://www.irs.gov/taxpayer-bill-of-rights (last \nvisited March 17, 2025). Those rights include \u201cthe \nright to pay no more than the correct amount of tax\u201d; \n\u201cthe right to challenge the position of the Internal \nRevenue Service and be heard\u201d; \u201cthe right to appeal a \ndecision of the Internal Revenue Service in an inde-\npendent forum\u201d; and \u201cthe right to finality.\u201d I.R.C. \n\u00a7 7803(a)(3)(C)-(F). Those rights underscore that the \nTax Court\u2019s jurisdiction under \u00a7 6330 does not vanish \n\n26 \n \n \njust because the IRS seeks to cut off the taxpayer\u2019s \nrights to challenge the agency\u2019s position. By the same \ntoken, nothing in I.R.C. \u00a7 6402, which governs offsets, \npurports to limit the Tax Court\u2019s authority to deter-\nmine the taxpayer\u2019s unpaid tax or liability under \n\u00a7 6330, and reading the provisions that way would in-\nsert words into the statute and contravene the \nTaxpayer Bill of Rights.  \n3. The Tax Court had jurisdiction under \n\u00a7 6330 to review the Appeals Office\u2019s \ndetermination, \nincluding \nits \nresolution of Zuch\u2019s entitlement to \nthe estimated payments. \nThe Tax Court had jurisdiction under \u00a7 6330 to re-\nview the Appeals Office\u2019s determination that Zuch \nwas not entitled to the estimated payments. \nZuch challenged the IRS\u2019s allocation of the esti-\nmated tax payments in the collection due process \nproceedings. In particular, she claimed that she did \nnot owe the IRS the $27,682 for the 2010 tax year be-\ncause the estimated payments should have been \ncredited to her. Pet. App. 9a; see Jeffers, 992 F.3d at \n653 n.4; Peoplease, 2025 WL 429626, at *2. Zuch had \na right to dispute that liability (or unpaid tax, if the \nIRS would prefer to classify it that way). Zuch did not \nreceive a notice of deficiency or otherwise have an op-\nportunity to challenge her claimed liability. Pet. \nApp. 10a. Regardless, Zuch was also entitled to raise \nher challenge as a \u201crelevant issue relating to the un-\npaid tax.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A).  \nAfter the Appeals Office made its determination, \nZuch timely petitioned the Tax Court for review. CA3 \nApp. A24-A30; see CA3 App. A266-270; Pet. App. 41a-\n42a. The Tax Court then had jurisdiction over the \n\n27 \n \n \nAppeals Office\u2019s decision, including the dispute over \nthe estimated payments. See I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2), \n(c)(3)(B), (d)(1). \nTo be sure, while the case was before the Tax \nCourt\u2014and after more than six years of litigation\u2014\nthe IRS announced that it was abandoning the levy. \nBut that didn\u2019t deprive the Tax Court of jurisdiction \nunder \u00a7 6330. Nothing in \u00a7 6330 purports to condition \nthe Tax Court\u2019s ongoing jurisdiction on the IRS\u2019s con-\ntinued pursuit of a levy. \nB. Zuch\u2019s case did not become moot when \nthe IRS decided to stop pursuing the \nlevy, because the parties disputed, and \nthe \nTax \nCourt \nhad \nthe \npower \nto \nadjudicate, Zuch\u2019s entitlement to the \nestimated payments. \nZuch\u2019s case isn\u2019t moot just because the IRS de-\ncided it no longer needed a levy. Mootness comes into \nplay only when the parties no longer have a concrete \ninterest in the outcome. But both Zuch and the IRS \nhave a concrete interest here because the Tax Court \ncan still decide Zuch\u2019s challenge to the Appeals Of-\nfice\u2019s \nunderlying \nliability \nor \nunpaid \ntax \ndeterminations and then rule that Zuch is entitled to \nthe estimated payments. If the Tax Court so rules, the \nIRS is likely to abide by that ruling and issue a refund. \nBut even if the IRS doesn\u2019t issue a refund, the Tax \nCourt\u2019s judgment would be preclusive in the refund \naction Zuch has brought in the District of New Jersey.  \n\n28 \n \n \n1. A case becomes moot only when the \nparties no longer have a concrete \ninterest \nin \nthe outcome \nof the \nlitigation and judicial relief is not \nlikely to redress any injury.  \nThe mootness inquiry asks whether standing \u201cex-\nists throughout the proceedings.\u201d Uzuegbunam v. \nPreczewski, 592 U.S. 279, 282 (2021). The \u201cirreducible \nconstitutional minimum of standing contains three el-\nements\u201d: \n(1) injury \nin \nfact, \n(2) causation \n(i.e., \ntraceability), and (3) redressability. Lujan v. Defend-\ners of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992). \u201cAs long \nas the parties have a concrete interest, however small, \nin the outcome of the litigation, the case is not moot.\u201d \nCampbell-Ewald Co. v. Gomez, 577 U.S. 153, 161 \n(2016). Thus, redressability requires only that judicial \nrelief \u201clikely\u201d will redress an injury, Federal Election \nCommission v. Cruz, 596 U.S. 289, 296 (2022), not \nthat \u201ca favorable decision will relieve\u201d \u201cevery injury,\u201d \nLarson v. Valente, 456 U.S. 228, 243-44 & n.15 (1982) \n(first emphasis added).  \n2. Zuch\u2019s challenge isn\u2019t moot because a \nfavorable \nTax \nCourt \nruling \non \nunderlying liability or unpaid tax \nwould likely redress her pocketbook \ninjury. \nZuch satisfies all three requirements of standing. \nShe suffered a concrete injury when the IRS applied \nthe $50,000 in estimated payments to her ex-hus-\nband\u2019s balance, rather than her own. See, e.g., \nTransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413, 425 \n(2021). If the IRS had applied the estimated payments \nto Zuch\u2019s account\u2014as both she and her ex-husband \nhad \nrequested\u2014Zuch \nwould \nhave \ngotten \nher \n\n29 \n \n \noverpayments back in later years. But, having refused \nto apply the estimated payments to Zuch\u2019s tax bill, the \nIRS kept her overpayments instead. Zuch\u2019s monetary \ninjury is thus traceable to the IRS\u2019s refusal to apply \nthe $50,000 in estimated payments to her 2010 tax \nbill. See Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Or-\nganization, 426 U.S. 26, 41-42 (1976). And the Tax \nCourt can redress Zuch\u2019s injury by ruling that the Ap-\npeals Office was wrong about her liability or unpaid \ntax and thus determining that Zuch is entitled to the \n$50,000 in estimated payments. \nAs noted, the Appeals Office\u2019s \u201cdetermination\u201d \n\u201cshall take into consideration\u201d \u201cthe issues raised\u201d at \nthe hearing, I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(3)(B), including \u201cany rel-\nevant issue relating to the unpaid tax\u201d and \u201cthe \nexistence or amount of the underlying tax liability,\u201d \nI.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2). And because the Tax Court \u201cshall \nhave jurisdiction\u201d to review \u201csuch determination,\u201d \nI.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1), the Tax Court can decide a tax-\npayer\u2019s unpaid tax or underlying tax liability, too. \nAccord Michael I. Saltzman & Leslie Book, IRS Prac-\ntice & Procedure \u00a7 14B.16[4][a] (updated Oct. 2024). \nIn Zuch\u2019s case, that means the Tax Court can rule on \nwhether she is entitled to credit for the estimated pay-\nments, underscoring both parties\u2019 concrete interest in \nthe outcome of the case. See Pet. App. 33a-34a, 42a. \nIf the Tax Court rules that Zuch is entitled to the \nestimated payments, the IRS is likely to issue Zuch a \nrefund. That\u2019s because \u201cit is substantially likely that \n[the IRS] would abide by\u201d that \u201cauthoritative\u201d holding \n\u201cby the [Tax] Court.\u201d Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 \nU.S. 788, 803 (1992); accord Reed v. Goertz, 598 U.S. \n230, 234 (2023); Pet. App. 38a. Indeed, it would be \nquite remarkable for the IRS to simply ignore the Tax \nCourt and decide not to return to Zuch the money that \n\n30 \n \n \na court has determined the IRS has no legal right to \nkeep. That is especially true because the Tax Court \nnot only has authority to review and rule on the un-\nderlying \nliability \nand \nunpaid \ntax \nissues \nin \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1), but it also has authority to put those rul-\nings into a declaratory judgment under \u00a7 6330(e), as \nexplained below (at 40-42). The consequence is that \nthe Tax Court will have \u201c\u2018ordered a change in a legal \nstatus,\u2019 and \u2018the practical consequence of that change \nwould amount to a significant increase in the likeli-\nhood\u2019\u201d that the IRS will give Zuch her money back. \nReed, 598 U.S. at 234. The Tax Court\u2019s authority to \nissue a \u201cdefinitive determination of the legal rights of \nthe parties,\u201d Medtronic, Inc. v. Mirowski Family Ven-\ntures, LLC, 571 U.S. 191, 200 (2014); see Haaland v. \nBrackeen, 599 U.S. 255, 293 (2023), leaves no doubt \nthat the court has the power to grant effective relief. \nEven if the IRS doesn\u2019t issue Zuch a refund, Zuch \nhas filed a refund suit in the District of New Jersey \nunder I.R.C. \u00a7 7422, and the Tax Court\u2019s ruling would \nhave preclusive effect in that suit. \u201cUnder the doctrine \nof issue preclusion, \u2018a prior judgment forecloses suc-\ncessive litigation of an issue of fact or law actually \nlitigated and resolved in a valid court determination \nessential to the prior judgment.\u2019\u201d Herrera v. Wyoming, \n587 U.S. 329, 342 (2019) (alterations adopted). \u201cThe \nidea is straightforward: Once a court has decided an \nissue, it is \u2018forever settled as between the parties.\u2019\u201d \nB&B Hardware, Inc. v. Hargis Industries, Inc., 575 \nU.S. 138, 147 (2015). That goes for declaratory relief \nissued in an earlier case, too. E.g., 18 Charles A. \nWright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Pro-\ncedure \u00a7 4421 (3d ed. updated June 2024). And the \ndoctrine applies \u201ceven if the issue recurs in the context \n\n31 \n \n \nof a different claim.\u201d Taylor v. Sturgell, 553 U.S. 880, \n892 (2008). \nHere, Zuch\u2019s entitlement to the estimated pay-\nments is an \u201cissue of \u2026 law\u201d that would be \u201cactually \nlitigated and resolved\u201d in the Tax Court proceeding \nand \u201cessential to\u201d the Tax Court\u2019s decision on Zuch\u2019s \nunpaid tax or underlying liability. Herrera, 587 U.S. \nat 342. Thus, the Tax Court\u2019s judgment would be pre-\nclusive in the refund suit Zuch has recently filed in the \nDistrict of New Jersey, and that court likely would or-\nder the government to issue a refund. See, e.g., \nParklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 U.S. 322, 325, 332-\n33 (1979). \nII. The IRS\u2019s counterarguments lack merit. \nA. The Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to review \nwhether Zuch was entitled to the \nprepayments didn\u2019t dissolve once the \nIRS no longer needed the levy. \nThe government claims (Br. 16-21), that the Tax \nCourt has jurisdiction under \u00a7 6330 to review a tax-\npayer\u2019s liability only if the IRS continues threatening \nto levy the taxpayer\u2019s property. In the government\u2019s \nview, \u00a7 6330\u2019s text, history, and \u201cfunction\u201d show that \n\u00a7 6330 focuses only on whether a levy can proceed, and \nthe Tax Court thus lacks jurisdiction when the IRS \ndecides it no longer needs a levy. The government also \nwarns that allowing the Tax Court to review live dis-\nputes about unpaid tax or taxpayer liability when no \nlevy is pending would vastly expand Tax Court juris-\ndiction. Those arguments fail. Section 6330\u2019s text, \nhistory, and remedial purpose, plus time-of-filing \nrules in other contexts, all confirm that the Tax Court \nretains jurisdiction under \u00a7 6330 to review a tax-\npayer\u2019s unpaid tax or underlying liability, even when \n\n32 \n \n \nthe IRS abandons its levy. And the government\u2019s pol-\nicy concern is meritless. \n1. There is no textual basis in \u00a7 6330 for \nthe \ngovernment\u2019s \ncontinuing-levy \nrequirement. \na. The government contends that without a \nthreatened levy, there is nothing for the \u201cunderlying \ntax liability\u201d to \u201cunderlie.\u201d Br. 26. So by implication, \nthe government claims, \u00a7 6330 jurisdiction turns on a \nthreatened levy. Br. 24-27. That argument fails. \nSection 6330(d)(1) makes clear that the Tax Court \nhas jurisdiction in \u00a7 6330 proceedings to review the \nAppeals Office\u2019s determination of the issues raised in \na collection due process hearing. Supra pp. 21-23. It \nsays that \u201cthe Tax Court shall have jurisdiction\u201d to re-\nview the Appeals Office\u2019s \u201cdetermination\u201d\u2014which \nincludes all the issues the Appeals Office was required \nto consider during the hearing, not just whether the \nlevy can proceed. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1); see I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(c)(2), (c)(3)(B). The \u201cunderlying liability\u201d lan-\nguage appears in the provisions of \u00a7 6330 listing the \nmatters a taxpayer may raise at the collection due pro-\ncess hearing. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B). The Appeals \nOffice\u2019s determination thus triggers the Tax Court\u2019s \njurisdiction under \u00a7 6330, and the IRS\u2019s actions after \nthe Appeals Office issues the determination have no \nbearing on that jurisdiction. \nWhat\u2019s more, even assuming the phrase \u201cunderly-\ning tax liability\u201d implies that there must be a proposed \nlevy at the outset of the collection due process hearing \n(and there was here), nothing in \u00a7 6330 conditions the \nTax Court\u2019s exercise of \u00a7 6330 jurisdiction on the IRS\u2019s \ncontinued pursuit of a levy. To the contrary, \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1) refers to the Tax Court\u2019s review of a \n\n33 \n \n \n\u201cdetermination\u201d by the Appeals Office. And even if \n\u00a7 6330 required a pending levy at the outset of Tax \nCourt proceedings, that requirement would be satis-\nfied because there was a threatened levy pending \nwhen Zuch petitioned the Tax Court. Infra pp. 38-39. \nThat makes sense. Zuch continues to be aggrieved by \nthe Appeals Office\u2019s determination upholding the \nIRS\u2019s liability assessment, even though the IRS claims \nit no longer needs the levy. \nViewing Zuch\u2019s challenge as one \u201crelating to the \nunpaid tax\u201d doesn\u2019t mean the Tax Court lost jurisdic-\ntion to review the dispute, either. That\u2019s because the \n$27,682 the IRS claims Zuch owed for the 2010 tax \nyear was \u201cunpaid\u201d when she petitioned the Tax Court \nin 2014. See Pet. App. 11a. \nb. The government also claims that the text of \n\u00a7 6330 is \u201cnarrowly focused\u201d on \u201cwhether the IRS may \ngo forward with its proposed levy,\u201d from the title for \nthe section to the provisions describing the beginning \nof collection due process proceedings and granting the \nTax Court jurisdiction. Br. 17; see Br. 17-20. Not so. \nFor starters, the title of a provision is \u201cnot meant \nto take the place of the detailed provisions of the text\u201d; \nnor is it \u201cnecessarily designed to be a reference guide \nor a synopsis.\u201d Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. \nBaltimore & Ohio Railroad Co., 331 U.S. 519, 528 \n(1947). What\u2019s more, even though a taxpayer can ini-\ntiate collection due process proceedings with the \nAppeals Office when the IRS seeks to levy, see I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(a)(1), the provisions that authorize the Tax \nCourt to review a taxpayer\u2019s liability challenge\u2014\n\u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B) and (d)(1)\u2014do not \u201cfocus[] on\u201d a levy. \nSection 6330(c)(2)(B), for instance, allows taxpayers in \nsome situations to \u201craise at the hearing challenges to \n\n34 \n \n \nthe existence or amount of the underlying tax liabil-\nity.\u201d And \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A) differentiates \u201crelevant \nissue[s] relating to the unpaid tax\u201d from issues about \n\u201cthe proposed levy.\u201d Section 6330(d)(1), moreover, \nstates that the taxpayer may \u201cpetition the Tax Court \nfor review of such determination (and the Tax Court \nshall have jurisdiction with respect to such matter).\u201d \nNo continuing-levy requirement there. \nc. Next, the government says that \u00a7 6330(d)(1)\u2019s \nreference to the Appeals Office\u2019s \u201cdetermination\u201d im-\nplies that Tax Court jurisdiction hinges on a \nthreatened levy because the \u201cdetermination\u201d is about \nonly \u201cwhether the levy may go forward.\u201d Br. 19-20. \nThat\u2019s wrong, too. Section 6330(d)(1) authorizes the \nTax Court to review that \u201cdetermination,\u201d which nec-\nessarily involves reviewing the Appeals Office\u2019s \nresolution of each issue raised at the collection due \nprocess hearing. Supra pp. 21-23. That includes, \nwhere relevant, the taxpayer\u2019s unpaid tax or underly-\ning liability, see I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2), (c)(3)(B)\u2014\ndeterminations, as this very case shows, with signifi-\ncance beyond whether a levy may proceed. Those \nrulings determine who keeps the money both parties \nclaim is legally theirs. And as the government admits \n(Br. 19-20), the Tax Court\u2019s resolution of those issues \nis part and parcel of the determination. Nothing in \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1) conditions the Tax Court\u2019s review of that \ndetermination\u2014and all the issues it resolves\u2014on a \ncontinuing levy. \nd. The government\u2019s atextual continuing-levy re-\nquirement fails for another reason: \u201cthe presumption \nfavoring judicial review of administrative action,\u201d \nGuerrero-Lasprilla, 589 U.S. at 229, weighs in favor of \nTax Court jurisdiction. The \u201cstrong presumption\u201d of \njudicial review directs that \u201cwhen a statutory \n\n35 \n \n \nprovision \u2018is reasonably susceptible to divergent inter-\npretation,\u2019\u201d courts must \u201cadopt the reading that \naccords with traditional understandings and basic \nprinciples: that executive determinations generally \nare subject to judicial review.\u201d Id. And where applica-\nble, the \u201cpresumption can only be overcome by \u2018clear \nand convincing evidence\u2019 of congressional intent to \npreclude judicial review.\u201d Id. Those principles also \nalign with this Court\u2019s recent recognition in the \u00a7 6330 \ncontext that jurisdictional requirements must be \n\u201cclearly state[d].\u201d Boechler, 596 U.S. at 203. \nHere, \u00a7 6330 is susceptible to one interpretation: \nthe Tax Court retains jurisdiction to review a deter-\nmination even if the IRS says it no longer needs the \nlevy. Supra pp. 21-26. Section 6330(d)(1) doesn\u2019t men-\ntion levies, much less contain a clear continuing-levy \nrequirement. But even if another reasonable interpre-\ntation were possible, it is far from clear that Congress \nintended to insulate the Appeals Office\u2019s unpaid tax \nand liability determinations when the IRS stops pur-\nsuing a levy. See Pet. Br. 34. \nThe presumption doesn\u2019t become irrelevant here \njust because Zuch can file a refund suit and obtain ju-\ndicial review of her entitlement to the estimated \npayments that way, as the government contends (id.). \nThe \u201cadministrative action\u201d at issue here is the Ap-\npeals Office\u2019s determination. Guerrero-Lasprilla, 589 \nU.S. at 229. So the question is whether that determi-\nnation is reviewable in the Tax Court under \u00a7 6330\u2014\nnot whether Zuch may obtain review of another ac-\ntion, in a different court, and under a different Code \nprovision. The presumption applies in answering the \nformer question. And the answer is that the Tax Court \nretains jurisdiction. \n\n36 \n \n \n2. The \ngovernment \nmisconstrues \n\u00a7 6330\u2019s history and downplays its \nremedial \npurpose, \nwhich \nboth \nsupport \nthe \nTax \nCourt\u2019s \n\u00a7 6330 \njurisdiction to review unpaid tax and \nliability disputes even if the IRS no \nlonger pursues the levy. \nThe government claims (Br. 22-23) that because \nCongress added \u00a7 6330 in 1998 to allow taxpayers to \nchallenge levies before the IRS seized their property, \nthat somehow shows that the Tax Court has jurisdic-\ntion only if a levy is pending. But that argument \ncannot trump plain text. And in any event, \u00a7 6330\u2019s \nhistory and purpose confirm that Congress wanted \nthe Tax Court to retain jurisdiction over a live unpaid \ntax or liability dispute even if the IRS no longer needs \na levy. \nCongress enacted \u00a7 6330 to protect taxpayers from \nthe IRS\u2019s abusive collection practices and to rein in the \nIRS\u2019s unchecked power to act as \u201cjudge, jury, and exe-\ncutioner, answerable to none.\u201d Hearings Before the \nCommittee on Finance at 56, 82; see supra pp. 9-10. \nAnd in designing \u00a7 6330\u2019s scheme, Congress sought to \n\u201censure that all taxpayers have due process and that \nthe IRS does not abusively use its liens-and-seizure \nauthority.\u201d 143 Cong. Rec. S12231 (statement of Sen. \nRoth). Indeed, the point of \u00a7 6330 proceedings is to \u201cin-\ncrease fairness to taxpayers\u201d before the IRS deprives \nthem of their property. S. Rep. No. 105-174, at 67; ac-\ncord Katz v. Commissioner, 115 T.C. 329, 333 n.8 \n(2000) (explaining that Congress enacted \u00a7 6330 \u201cto \nprovide new protections for taxpayers\u201d). \nSection 6330 did just that. It gave taxpayers a \nchance to challenge their liability before paying it \n\n37 \n \n \nwhen the taxpayer did not already have an oppor-\ntunity to challenge the liability, and ensured \ntaxpayers may always raise \u201cany relevant issue relat-\ning to the unpaid tax.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2). Section \n6330 thus gave taxpayers an opportunity for IRS Ap-\npeals to reach a \u201cdetermination\u201d on their unpaid tax \nor liability, and granted taxpayers the right \u201cto peti-\ntion the Tax Court to contest the Appeals [Office\u2019s] \ndecision,\u201d 144 Cong. Rec. S4494 (statement of Sen. \nHatch). Put simply, history shows that Congress did \nnot intend to enable the IRS to unilaterally deprive \nthe Tax Court of jurisdiction to review unpaid tax or \nliability disputes by finding another way to take the \ntaxpayer\u2019s money and then claiming it no longer seeks \nthe levy. And given \u00a7 6330\u2019s history, the Court should \nconstrue the statute \u201cbroadly to effectuate its pur-\nposes.\u201d Tcherepnin v. Knight, 389 U.S. 332, 336 (1967); \nsee Piedmont & Northern Railway. v. Interstate Com-\nmerce Commission, 286 U.S. 299, 311 (1932). \n3. Royal \nCanin \ndoesn\u2019t \nhelp \nthe \ngovernment. \nPointing to this Court\u2019s decision in Royal Canin, \nthe government argues that \u00a7 6330 contains a contin-\nuing-levy requirement because the IRS \u201calter[s]\u201d \n\u201c[t]he fundamental basis\u201d of the suit when it decides \nto no longer seek the levy. Br. 29-31. That argument \nfails. \nIn Royal Canin, the Court held that, if a plaintiff \namends her complaint to \u201celiminate[] the federal-law \nclaims that enabled removal, leaving only state-law \nclaims behind, the court\u2019s power to decide the dispute \ndissolves.\u201d 604 U.S. at 30. That makes sense, given the \nbasic idea that \u201c[i]f a plaintiff amends her complaint, \nthe new pleading \u2018supersedes\u2019 the old one.\u201d Id. at 35 \n\n38 \n \n \n(citing 6 Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice \nand Procedure \u00a7 1476 (3d ed. 2010)). And in Royal \nCanin, the plaintiff altered the basis for the federal \ncourt\u2019s federal question jurisdiction by amending her \ncomplaint to withdraw her federal claims.  \nNone of those principles shows that the Tax Court \nlost jurisdiction under \u00a7 6330 to review the Appeals \nOffice\u2019s determination when the IRS stopped pursuing \nthe levy. The basis of the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction un-\nder \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1) \nis \nthe \nAppeals \nOffice\u2019s \ndetermination\u2014not the proposed levy. The IRS did \nnot change the basis of the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction by \ndropping the levy, because once the Appeals Office is-\nsues a \u201cdetermination,\u201d the Tax Court has jurisdiction \nto review it. See I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1) (\u201cthe Tax Court \nshall have jurisdiction\u201d to \u201creview\u201d the \u201cdetermina-\ntion\u201d). And unlike the plaintiff in Royal Canin, Zuch \ndidn\u2019t file an amended pleading changing the basis of \nthe Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction. When Zuch filed her Tax \nCourt petition, she challenged the Appeals Office\u2019s de-\ntermination that she was not entitled to the estimated \npayments. That\u2019s still her challenge today, and the \nIRS\u2019s decision to stop pursuing the levy is irrelevant.  \nBut even assuming the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction \nunder \u00a7 6330 was somehow contingent on a levy, time-\nof-filing rules show that any levy requirement was \nmet because there was a pending levy when Zuch pe-\ntitioned the Tax Court. Time-of-filing rules generally \nprovide that jurisdiction \u201cdepends upon the state of \nthings at the time\u201d the plaintiff brings the action, \nGrupo Dataflux v. Atlas Global Group, L.P., 541 U.S. \n567, 570 (2004); see, e.g., Conolly v. Taylor, 27 U.S. (2 \nPet.) 556, 565 (1829)\u2014here, when the taxpayer peti-\ntions the Tax Court. So, if \u00a7 6330 did require a pending \nlevy, that levy requirement would be assessed at the \n\n39 \n \n \ntime the taxpayer files her Tax Court petition. And \nhere, there was a pending levy when Zuch petitioned \nthe Tax Court. Pet. App. 11a, 13a. The IRS\u2019s decision \nto stop pursuing the levy thus does not destroy the Tax \nCourt\u2019s jurisdiction to review the Appeals Office\u2019s de-\ntermination, even if \u00a7 6330 contains a levy-based \njurisdictional requirement. \n4. The government\u2019s policy argument is \nmeritless. \nThe government claims that, if it cannot deprive \nthe Tax Court of jurisdiction to review a liability chal-\nlenge by no longer seeking the levy, \u00a7 6330 will turn \ninto a \u201cgeneral forum for considering challenges to tax \nliability.\u201d Br. 24. That argument lacks merit. \nThere\u2019s no risk of the Tax Court wading into gen-\neral liability determinations in \u00a7 6330 proceedings. \nSection 6330 specifies the issues taxpayers may raise \nin \ncollection \ndue \nprocess \nhearings. \nI.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A). And only taxpayers who did not have \nan earlier opportunity to challenge their assessed lia-\nbility can challenge that claimed liability in collection \ndue process proceedings. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B). The \nTax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to review the taxpayer\u2019s lia-\nbility (or issue relating to the unpaid tax), in turn, is \ntied to the Appeals Office\u2019s liability determination. \nI.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). The sky isn\u2019t falling, and the gov-\nernment hasn\u2019t pointed to any \u00a7 6330 cases pending \nbefore the Appeals Office or the Tax Court that would \nsuggest otherwise. \nWhat\u2019s more, the question presented in this case \narises rarely, and when it does, it\u2019s only as a result of \n\u201cthe IRS\u2019s own recalcitrance.\u201d Boechler, 596 U.S. at \n207. The question arises only when the IRS initiates a \nlevy, but during \u00a7 6330 proceedings, finds a way to \n\n40 \n \n \ntake the taxpayer\u2019s money another way, and drops the \nlevy during the Tax Court\u2019s review. But there\u2019s no rea-\nson to think the issue comes up with any frequency. \nB. The Tax Court\u2019s authority is not limited \nto approving or rejecting a proposed \nlevy, but includes the power to issue \nbinding judgments. \nThe government argues that the Tax Court \ndoesn\u2019t have the power to declare Zuch\u2019s entitlement \nto the estimated payments. In the government\u2019s view, \n\u00a7 6330 doesn\u2019t authorize that relief, the DJA\u2019s prohi-\nbition on declaratory relief in most tax cases bars \nbinding relief here, and \u00a7 6330 is a \u201climited mecha-\nnism\u201d for either allowing or disallowing a levy. Br. 23-\n24, 27-29. Those arguments are meritless. \nFirst, \u00a7 6330(d)(1) authorizes the Tax Court to de-\ntermine whether the estimated payments should have \ncovered the amount the IRS assessed for the 2010 tax \nyear, no matter whether there is a pending levy. \nThat\u2019s because the Tax Court \u201cshall have jurisdiction\u201d \nto \u201creview\u201d the Appeals Office\u2019s determination of the \ntaxpayer\u2019s underlying liability or issues relating to \nher unpaid tax. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B), (d)(1). And that \nmeans the Tax Court can issue a ruling resolving \nZuch\u2019s liability or issues relating to the unpaid tax. \nThe IRS is expected to abide by that ruling, and in-\ndeed, that ruling will have preclusive effect. Supra \npp. 28-31. \nSecond, \u00a7 6330(e)(1) confirms that the Tax Court \ncan issue its ruling in the form of declaratory relief. \nThat provision authorizes injunctive relief in \u00a7 6330 \nproceedings, which necessarily means it also author-\nizes declaratory relief. That\u2019s because an injunction \nnecessarily rests on a declaration. Indeed, an \n\n41 \n \n \ninjunction prohibiting an act incorporates \u201ca judicial \ndeclaration that [the act] is illegal,\u201d Pet. App. 36a. \nAnd as this Court has recognized, declaratory relief is \na \u201cmilder\u201d alternative to an injunction. Steffel v. \nThompson, 415 U.S. 452, 466-67 (1974). Thus, the Tax \nCourt\u2019s authority to issue an injunction under \n\u00a7 6330(e)(1) includes the authority to issue declara-\ntory relief. \nResisting that conclusion, the government asserts \nthat \u00a7 6330(e)(1) can\u2019t authorize declaratory relief be-\ncause it limits injunctive authority to \u201ca specific \ncollection action.\u201d Br. 28-29. Not so. Section 6330(e)(1) \nauthorizes the Tax Court to enjoin \u201cany action or pro-\nceeding\u201d if: (1) \u201ca timely appeal has been filed under \nsubsection (d)(1),\u201d and (2) the injunction is \u201cin respect \nof the unpaid tax or proposed levy to which the deter-\nmination being appealed relates.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(e)(1); \nsee I.R.C. \u00a7 7421(a). And if the Tax Court can issue an \ninjunction \u201cin respect of the unpaid tax or proposed \nlevy,\u201d it can also decide the taxpayer\u2019s liability that \ngave rise to both the unpaid tax and the proposed levy.  \nThird, the DJA doesn\u2019t withdraw the Tax Court\u2019s \nauthority to issue declaratory relief. That statute au-\nthorizes federal courts to \u201cdeclare the rights and other \nlegal relations of any interested party seeking such \ndeclaration,\u201d \u201cexcept with respect to Federal taxes.\u201d 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2201(a). But courts have uniformly held that \nthe DJA must be read together with the Tax Code and \nthe AIA, I.R.C. \u00a7 7421(a). And that means the DJA \ndoes not prohibit declaratory relief where those other \nprovisions permit injunctions. E.g., Cohen v. United \nStates, 650 F.3d 717, 727-28 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (en banc); \nCIC Services, LLC v. Internal Revenue Service, 925 \nF.3d 247, 250 n.3 (6th Cir. 2019), rev\u2019d on other \ngrounds 593 U.S. 209 (2021); see Bob Jones University \n\n42 \n \n \nv. Simon, 416 U.S. 725, 732 n.7 (1974). Both the plain \ntext of \u00a7 6330(d)(1) and (e)(1) and the AIA, I.R.C. \n\u00a7 7421(a), authorize injunctions in \u00a7 6330 proceed-\nings, so declaratory relief is authorized as well. \nFinally, as explained (at 32-35), \u00a7 6330 isn\u2019t just \nabout whether a levy can proceed or not, so the Tax \nCourt\u2019s authority is not limited to deciding whether or \nnot a levy can proceed, either. Instead, Congress en-\nacted \u00a7 6330 to create a meaningful exception to what \nthe government says is the Tax Code\u2019s historical \u201cpay \nnow, dispute later\u201d framework. See Pet. Br. 2. It did so \nby allowing taxpayers to challenge the unpaid tax and \ntheir liability before they decide to pay or the IRS lev-\nies their property. And as \u00a7 6330\u2019s history confirms, \nthe Tax Court retains jurisdiction under \u00a7 6330 to re-\nview the Appeals Office\u2019s determination of her unpaid \ntax or tax liability, so it can issue binding relief resolv-\ning those issues, too. Supra pp. 23-24, 36-37. \nC. The government\u2019s claim that the parties \nlack a legally cognizable interest in the \ncase once the IRS decides not to move \nforward with the levy is incorrect. \nUnable to show that its actions deprived the Tax \nCourt of \u00a7 6330 jurisdiction, the IRS next contends \n(Br. 21), that the case is moot because once the IRS \ndecides it doesn\u2019t need a levy, the parties lack a legally \ncognizable interest. That is so, the IRS says, because \neven if \u201cthe IRS has made an error or continues to owe \n[the taxpayer] money,\u201d there\u2019s no threatened levy, and \nthe levy is \u201cthe issue that prompted\u201d the collection due \nprocess hearing. Id. That argument fails. \nThe question isn\u2019t whether \u201cthe issue that \nprompted\u201d a collection due process hearing is live. Ra-\nther, \u201c[a]s long as the parties have a concrete interest, \n\n43 \n \n \nhowever small, in the outcome of the litigation,\u201d the \ncase is not moot. Campbell-Ewald Co., 577 U.S. at \n161. And as explained, Zuch has a concrete interest in \nthe outcome of the litigation because the Tax Court \ncan adjudicate her unpaid tax or underlying liability \nby determining her right to the estimated payments, \nand therefore to a refund. Accord Saltzman & Book, \nsupra, \u00a7 14B.16[4][a]. That ruling would also be pre-\nclusive in the refund action Zuch has brought in the \nDistrict of New Jersey under I.R.C. \u00a7 7422. The IRS \nhas a concrete interest, too: if the Tax Court decides \nthat Zuch is not entitled to the estimated payments, \nthe IRS keeps her money. It is thus not \u201cimpossible for \na court to grant any effectual relief what[so]ever\u201d to \nwhomever prevails. Chafin v. Chafin, 568 U.S. 165, \n172 (2013). \nD. Whether Zuch\u2019s challenge is a dispute \nabout an unpaid tax or underlying \nliability is immaterial. \nIn a footnote, the government claims that Zuch\u2019s \nchallenge presents \u201can issue relating to [her] unpaid \ntax,\u201d rather than her tax liability. Br. 25 n.3. But, as \nthe government concedes, whether Zuch\u2019s challenge is \nabout an unpaid tax or underlying liability is immate-\nrial. Id. (\u201cThe Court need not \u2026 decide this dispute to \nresolve the question presented.\u201d). The difference \ndoesn\u2019t matter because, as explained (at 26-27), even \nif Zuch\u2019s challenge is one related to an \u201cunpaid tax,\u201d \nthe Tax Court still had jurisdiction. That\u2019s because \nZuch\u2019s challenge to her unpaid tax would still have \nbeen part of the Appeals Office\u2019s \u201cdetermination\u201d that \nwas reviewable by the Tax Court. Id. \nIn any event, the Appeals Office itself considered \nZuch to be challenging her underlying tax liability. \n\n44 \n \n \nPet. App. 48a, 66a. Indeed, she disputed whether she \nowed \u201cthe amounts that the Commissioner assessed \nfor [the 2010] tax period,\u201d Jeffers, 992 F.3d at 653 n.4, \nbecause she argued the estimated payments should \nhave been applied to her, see Peoplease, 2025 WL \n429626, at *2. Supra p. 26. And, in the IRS\u2019s own view, \n\u201cunpaid tax\u201d is just the unpaid portion of the \u201cunder-\nlying tax liability\u201d anyway. Internal Revenue Service \nChief Counsel Notice CC-2014-002 at 3. \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should affirm the judgment of the court \nof appeals and remand for further proceedings. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nRaza Rasheed \nSKADDEN, ARPS, SLATE,  \n  MEAGHER & FLOM LLP \n2000 Ave. of the Stars, \n  Ste. 200N \nLos Angeles, CA 90067 \n \nFrank Agostino \nAGOSTINO & \n  ASSOCIATES, P.C.  \n14 Washington Place \nHackensack, NJ 07601 \n \nShay Dvoretzky \n  Counsel of Record \nParker Rider-Longmaid \nArmando Gomez \nSylvia O.

App., infra, 1a-9a.  \nINTRODUCTION \nThe federal tax system operates on a simple default \npremise: pay now, dispute later.  In 1998, Congress en-\nacted a narrow exception to that rule.  If the Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS) seeks to levy on\u2014that is, affirm-\natively seize and sell\u2014a taxpayer\u2019s property, the IRS \ngenerally must provide the taxpayer with pre-levy notice \nand an opportunity for a hearing before the IRS Indepen-\ndent Office of Appeals (Appeals Office).  26 U.S.C. 6330.  \nThe Appeals Office makes a \u201cdetermination\u201d whether the \nIRS may proceed with \u201cthe levy action[] which [is] the \nsubject of the requested hearing.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3) \nand (e)(1).  A taxpayer disappointed with the outcome \nof the pre-levy hearing may \u201cpetition the Tax Court for \nreview of such determination.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1).   \nThis case presents the question whether a Section \n6330 proceeding in the Tax Court becomes moot when \nthere is no longer a live controversy over the levy.  Here, \nthe IRS initially proposed a levy on respondent\u2019s prop-\nerty, and she initiated a Section 6330 proceeding for \npre-deprivation review.  But before the Tax Court\u2019s re-\nview concluded, the IRS determined that respondent\u2019s \nintervening, additional payments meant that she no long-\ner owed any additional tax, so the IRS no longer sought \nto collect by levying on her property.   \nThat development mooted the proceeding for pre-\nlevy review.  When the IRS has decided not to pursue its \nproposed levy, the taxpayer has already received \u201cthe \nvery relief [she] ostensibly sought\u201d by requesting a pre-\ndeprivation hearing.  Willson v. Commissioner, 805 \nF.3d 316, 321 (D.C. Cir. 2015).  The Tax Court can pro-\n\n3 \n \nvide no further relief, and the Section 6330 proceeding \nmust end.  \nThe text of Section 6330 makes clear that it provides \na narrow path for review of a proposed levy\u2014not a \nmeans to circumvent the usual methods of disputing a \ntaxpayer\u2019s liability.  The decision below thus erred in \nconcluding that the Tax Court could still address wheth-\ner respondent has any \u201cunderlying tax liability\u201d\u2014an is-\nsue that may be considered under 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B) \nwhen evaluating whether a proposed levy may proceed.  \nWhen there is no proposed levy to adjudicate, the ques-\ntion of tax liability ceases to be an \u201cunderlying\u201d one.  \nNor does the Tax Court have jurisdiction to issue de-\nclaratory relief separate from its ability to enjoin the \nproposed levy that is \u201cthe subject of the requested hear-\ning.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(1). \nThat there is no longer review under Section 6330 \ndoes not foreclose judicial review of the IRS\u2019s handling \nof respondent\u2019s taxes.  Rather, as respondent has al-\nready acknowledged (Br. in Opp. 2, 4, 13, 16, 25), she \ncan proceed under the general rule and dispute the as-\nsessment and collection of her taxes in a refund suit.  \nBecause the court of appeals\u2019 contrary decision thwarts \nCongress\u2019s distinction between that general rule and \nthe narrow exception for pre-levy review, this Court \nshould reverse. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal Background \n1. The traditional mechanism for a taxpayer to dis-\npute the assessment or collection of a federal tax is a \npost-payment suit for a refund.  See CIC Servs., LLC v. \nIRS, 593 U.S. 209, 212 (2021) (\u201c[A] person can typically \nchallenge a federal tax only after he pays it, by suing for \na refund.\u201d).  To bring a refund suit, a taxpayer must first \n\n4 \n \npay the tax and then request a refund from the IRS.   \n26 U.S.C. 6402(a), 6511; 26 C.F.R. 301.6402\u20132; Flora v. \nUnited States, 357 U.S. 63, 64-75 (1958), aff\u200a\u2019d on reh\u2019g, \n362 U.S. 145 (1960).  If the refund is denied, the tax-\npayer may sue to recover the disputed amount.  28 \nU.S.C. 1346(a)(1); see 26 U.S.C. 6532, 7422(a); 28 U.S.C. \n1491(a)(1); United States v. Clintwood Elkhorn Mining \nCo., 553 U.S. 1, 4 (2008); see also, e.g., G.M. Leasing \nCorp. v. United States, 429 U.S. 338, 352 n.18 (1977) \n(collecting cases for the proposition that post-payment \nreview of a tax liability comports with due process).  \nFor certain taxes, however, Congress has also pro-\nvided a pre-assessment avenue for judicial review.  Spe-\ncifically, for income, estate, gift, and various other \ntaxes, Congress has directed the IRS to issue a \u201cnotice \nof  * * *  deficiency\u201d to a taxpayer who has failed to re-\nport a tax properly.  26 U.S.C. 6212(a).  The taxpayer \nmay then file a petition for redetermination in the Tax \nCourt.  26 U.S.C. 6213.  With certain exceptions, the \nIRS may not attempt to collect the tax at issue before \nthe time for seeking judicial review has expired or while \nsuch review is pending.  26 U.S.C. 6213(a).  \nThe Internal Revenue Code and other statutes chan-\nnel judicial review of challenges to tax assessment and \ncollection to those prescribed mechanisms.  The Tax \nAnti-Injunction Act, 26 U.S.C. 7421(a), and the tax ex-\nception to the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. \n2201(a), generally preclude suits for injunctive and de-\nclaratory relief regarding the assessment or collection \nof taxes.  And 26 U.S.C. 7422(a) precludes suits to re-\ncover taxes alleged to have been assessed or collected \nunlawfully before a taxpayer has properly sought a re-\nfund from the IRS. \n\n5 \n \n2. Following assessment, if a taxpayer who is \u201cliable \nto pay any tax neglects or refuses to pay,\u201d the IRS may \ngenerally \u201ccollect such tax\u201d by \u201clevy[ing] upon\u201d the tax-\npayer\u2019s property, i.e., seizing and selling it.  26 U.S.C. \n6331(a); see 26 U.S.C. 6331(b) (defining \u201clevy\u201d to \u201cin-\nclude[] the power of distraint and seizure by any means,\u201d \nand permitting the sale of \u201csuch property or rights to \nproperty\u201d); see also 26 U.S.C. 6321 (providing for tax \nliens).  Certain types of property\u2014including, with some \nexceptions, residences, welfare and unemployment ben-\nefits, and particular pensions\u2014are exempt from levies.  \nSee 26 U.S.C. 6334. \nBefore 1998, the Internal Revenue Code authorized \nthe IRS to levy upon taxpayer property without any \nprior opportunity for a hearing or other pre-collection \nprocess, so long as adequate post-deprivation proce-\ndures were available.  See Phillips v. Commissioner, \n283 U.S. 589, 595 (1931); 26 U.S.C. 6331(d) (1994).  In \n1998, however, Congress established procedures that \nthe IRS generally must follow before levying.  See Tax-\npayer Bill of Rights 3 (Taxpayer Bill of Rights), Pub. L. \nNo. 105-206, Tit. III, \u00a7 3401(b), 112 Stat. 747-749 (26 \nU.S.C. 6330); see also id. \u00a7 3401(a), 112 Stat. 746-747 (26 \nU.S.C. 6320) (substantially similar framework for IRS \nfiling of a notice of federal tax lien).  \nThose procedures are codified in Section 6330 of the \nCode, which is entitled \u201c[n]otice and opportunity for \nhearing before levy.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330.  Under those pro-\ncedures, \u201c[n]o levy may be made\u201d unless the IRS pro-\nvides the taxpayer with 30 days\u2019 notice and the oppor-\ntunity to request a hearing.  26 U.S.C. 6330(a)(1); see 26 \nU.S.C. 6330(a)(2) and (3).   \nIf the taxpayer makes such a request, an administra-\ntive hearing to review the proposed levy\u2014sometimes \n\n6 \n \ncalled a \u201ccollection due process hearing,\u201d Boechler, P.C. \nv. Commissioner, 596 U.S. 199, 202 (2022)\u2014is con-\nducted by an impartial officer in the Appeals Office.  26 \nU.S.C. 6330(b).  The taxpayer\u2019s request for a hearing \nsuspends \u201cthe levy actions which are the subject of the \nrequested hearing\u201d as well as the running of specified \nlimitations periods.  26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(1).   \nAt the hearing, the taxpayer may raise \u201cany relevant \nissue relating to the unpaid tax or the proposed levy,\u201d \nincluding \u201cchallenges to the appropriateness of collec-\ntion actions\u201d and \u201coffers of collection alternatives.\u201d  26 \nU.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(A)(ii) and (iii); see 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(4) \n(excluding certain issues that were previously litigated \nor qualify as frivolous).  If the taxpayer \u201cdid not receive \nany statutory notice of deficiency for [the relevant] tax \nliability or did not otherwise have an opportunity to dis-\npute such tax liability,\u201d she also may raise \u201cchallenges \nto the existence or amount of the underlying tax liabil-\nity.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B). \nAt the conclusion of a Section 6330 hearing, the  \nAppeals Office issues its \u201cdetermination,\u201d 26 U.S.C. \n6330(c)(3), which is \u201ca written notice\u201d reflecting wheth-\ner \u201ccollection by way of levy may proceed.\u201d  Lunsford v. \nCommissioner, 117 T.C. 159, 164-165 (2001).  The Ap-\npeals Office reaches its determination after considering \nstatutorily delineated factors, including whether the re-\nquirements of applicable law or administrative proce-\ndure have been met, 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(1) and (3)(A); the \nissues raised by the taxpayer, 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2) and \n(3); and \u201cwhether any proposed collection action bal-\nances the need for the efficient collection of taxes with \nthe legitimate concern of the [taxpayer] that any collec-\ntion action be no more intrusive than necessary,\u201d 26 \nU.S.C. 6330(c)(3)(C).   \n\n7 \n \nA taxpayer who is dissatisfied with a determination \nsustaining a levy may petition the United States Tax \nCourt \u201cfor review of such determination (and the Tax \nCourt shall have jurisdiction with respect to such mat-\nter).\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1).  The Tax Court\u2019s decision, \nin turn, is subject to review by a federal court of ap-\npeals.  26 U.S.C. 7482(a)(1). \n3. Although a taxpayer\u2019s request for a Section 6330 \nhearing suspends \u201cthe levy actions which are the sub-\nject of the requested hearing\u201d and certain limitations \nperiods, 26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(1), other mechanisms for tax \ncollection may proceed.  Most relevant here, when a tax-\npayer overpays the tax owed for a particular year, the \nIRS \u201cmay credit the amount of such overpayment\u201d \nagainst \u201cany liability in respect of an internal revenue \ntax on the part of the person who made the overpay-\nment\u201d instead of refunding that amount to the taxpayer.  \n26 U.S.C. 6402(a).   \nThat application of overpayment credits\u2014sometimes \nreferred to as an \u201coffset\u201d\u2014is an administrative action \ndistinct from the collection of a tax by a levy or lien on \nthe taxpayer\u2019s property.  See Belloff v. Commissioner, \n996 F.2d 607, 616 (2d Cir. 1993); Boyd v. Commissioner, \n124 T.C. 296, 300 (2005); 26 C.F.R. 301.6330\u20131(g)(2),  \nQ & A-G3.  A taxpayer may challenge the application of \ncredits through the traditional mechanism for disputing \nthe collection of a federal tax: filing a refund claim with \nthe IRS and, if necessary, a refund suit.  See 26 U.S.C. \n7422(a) and (d). \nB. The Present Controversy \n1. From 1993 to 2014, respondent was married to \nPatrick Gennardo.  Pet. App. 7a.  This case concerns the \n2010 tax year, for which respondent and Gennardo ulti-\nmately filed separate tax returns.  Ibid.  \n\n8 \n \na. In 2010 and 2011, respondent and Gennardo made \ntwo estimated tax payments, totaling $50,000, to the \nIRS for tax year 2010.  Pet. App. 8a.  First, the couple \nsubmitted an estimated tax payment of $20,000.  Ibid.  \nThe accompanying Form 1040-ES identified both of \ntheir names, but it did not indicate that they would be \nfiling separate returns, and it provided no instructions \non how to allocate the payment between them.  C.A. \nApp. 274, 314.  Second, Gennardo submitted a $30,000 \nbank check, which identified only Gennardo as the re-\nmitter.  Pet. App. 8a; see C.A. App. 274, 315.  The sub-\nject line of the accompanying cover letter identified \nboth respondent and Gennardo, but neither the check \nnor any accompanying documentation instructed the \nIRS to allocate any part of that payment to respondent.  \nC.A. App. 275, 315, 633, 638. \nb. On September 12, 2012, the couple filed separate \n(and untimely) 2010 federal income-tax returns.  Pet. \nApp. 7a; see C.A. App. 316-381.  Respondent did not claim \nany of the $50,000 in estimated tax payments on her re-\nturn, while Gennardo claimed $10,000 in estimated tax \npayments on his return.  C.A. App. 317, 331. Respond-\nent\u2019s and Gennardo\u2019s tax returns were prepared by the \nsame tax preparer.  Id. at 277. \nOn the same day that they submitted their separate \ntax returns, Gennardo made a written compromise offer \nto the IRS about his outstanding federal tax liabilities \nfor tax years 2007 through 2011.  C.A. App. 278, 382.  \nAlthough the offer covered years in which respondent \nand Gennardo had filed joint tax returns, Gennardo\u2019s  \noffer-in-compromise did not include respond\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

App. 1a-39a) \nis reported at 97 F.4th 81.  The decisions of the United \nStates Tax Court and the Internal Revenue Service  \nIndependent Office of Appeals (Pet. App. 44a-49a, 50a-\n60a) are unreported. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nMarch 22, 2024.  A petition for rehearing was denied on \nJune 26, 2024 (Pet. App. 68a-69a).  On September 12, \n2024, Justice Alito extended the time within which to \nfile a petition for a writ of certiorari to and including \nOctober 11, 2024, and the petition was filed on that date.  \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari was granted on Jan-\nuary 10, 2025.  The jurisdiction of this Court rests on 28 \nU.S.C. 1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent statutory provisions are reprinted in an \nappendix to this brief.  App., infra, 1a-9a.  \nINTRODUCTION \nThe federal tax system operates on a simple default \npremise: pay now, dispute later.  In 1998, Congress en-\nacted a narrow exception to that rule.  If the Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS) seeks to levy on\u2014that is, affirm-\natively seize and sell\u2014a taxpayer\u2019s property, the IRS \ngenerally must provide the taxpayer with pre-levy notice \nand an opportunity for a hearing before the IRS Indepen-\ndent Office of Appeals (Appeals Office).  26 U.S.C. 6330.  \nThe Appeals Office makes a \u201cdetermination\u201d whether the \nIRS may proceed with \u201cthe levy action[] which [is] the \nsubject of the requested hearing.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3) \nand (e)(1).  A taxpayer disappointed with the outcome \nof the pre-levy hearing may \u201cpetition the Tax Court for \nreview of such determination.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1).   \nThis case presents the question whether a Section \n6330 proceeding in the Tax Court becomes moot when \nthere is no longer a live controversy over the levy.  Here, \nthe IRS initially proposed a levy on respondent\u2019s prop-\nerty, and she initiated a Section 6330 proceeding for \npre-deprivation review.  But before the Tax Court\u2019s re-\nview concluded, the IRS determined that respondent\u2019s \nintervening, additional payments meant that she no long-\ner owed any additional tax, so the IRS no longer sought \nto collect by levying on her property.   \nThat development mooted the proceeding for pre-\nlevy review.  When the IRS has decided not to pursue its \nproposed levy, the taxpayer has already received \u201cthe \nvery relief [she] ostensibly sought\u201d by requesting a pre-\ndeprivation hearing.  Willson v. Commissioner, 805 \nF.3d 316, 321 (D.C. Cir. 2015).  The Tax Court can pro-\n\n3 \n \nvide no further relief, and the Section 6330 proceeding \nmust end.  \nThe text of Section 6330 makes clear that it provides \na narrow path for review of a proposed levy\u2014not a \nmeans to circumvent the usual methods of disputing a \ntaxpayer\u2019s liability.  The decision below thus erred in \nconcluding that the Tax Court could still address wheth-\ner respondent has any \u201cunderlying tax liability\u201d\u2014an is-\nsue that may be considered under 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B) \nwhen evaluating whether a proposed levy may proceed.  \nWhen there is no proposed levy to adjudicate, the ques-\ntion of tax liability ceases to be an \u201cunderlying\u201d one.  \nNor does the Tax Court have jurisdiction to issue de-\nclaratory relief separate from its ability to enjoin the \nproposed levy that is \u201cthe subject of the requested hear-\ning.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(1). \nThat there is no longer review under Section 6330 \ndoes not foreclose judicial review of the IRS\u2019s handling \nof respondent\u2019s taxes.  Rather, as respondent has al-\nready acknowledged (Br. in Opp. 2, 4, 13, 16, 25), she \ncan proceed under the general rule and dispute the as-\nsessment and collection of her taxes in a refund suit.  \nBecause the court of appeals\u2019 contrary decision thwarts \nCongress\u2019s distinction between that general rule and \nthe narrow exception for pre-levy review, this Court \nshould reverse. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal Background \n1. The traditional mechanism for a taxpayer to dis-\npute the assessment or collection of a federal tax is a \npost-payment suit for a refund.  See CIC Servs., LLC v. \nIRS, 593 U.S. 209, 212 (2021) (\u201c[A] person can typically \nchallenge a federal tax only after he pays it, by suing for \na refund.\u201d).  To bring a refund suit, a taxpayer must first \n\n4 \n \npay the tax and then request a refund from the IRS.   \n26 U.S.C. 6402(a), 6511; 26 C.F.R. 301.6402\u20132; Flora v. \nUnited States, 357 U.S. 63, 64-75 (1958), aff\u200a\u2019d on reh\u2019g, \n362 U.S. 145 (1960).  If the refund is denied, the tax-\npayer may sue to recover the disputed amount.  28 \nU.S.C. 1346(a)(1); see 26 U.S.C. 6532, 7422(a); 28 U.S.C. \n1491(a)(1); United States v. Clintwood Elkhorn Mining \nCo., 553 U.S. 1, 4 (2008); see also, e.g., G.M. Leasing \nCorp. v. United States, 429 U.S. 338, 352 n.18 (1977) \n(collecting cases for the proposition that post-payment \nreview of a tax liability comports with due process).  \nFor certain taxes, however, Congress has also pro-\nvided a pre-assessment avenue for judicial review.  Spe-\ncifically, for income, estate, gift, and various other \ntaxes, Congress has directed the IRS to issue a \u201cnotice \nof  * * *  deficiency\u201d to a taxpayer who has failed to re-\nport a tax properly.  26 U.S.C. 6212(a).  The taxpayer \nmay then file a petition for redetermination in the Tax \nCourt.  26 U.S.C. 6213.  With certain exceptions, the \nIRS may not attempt to collect the tax at issue before \nthe time for seeking judicial review has expired or while \nsuch review is pending.  26 U.S.C. 6213(a).  \nThe Internal Revenue Code and other statutes chan-\nnel judicial review of challenges to tax assessment and \ncollection to those prescribed mechanisms.  The Tax \nAnti-Injunction Act, 26 U.S.C. 7421(a), and the tax ex-\nception to the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. \n2201(a), generally preclude suits for injunctive and de-\nclaratory relief regarding the assessment or collection \nof taxes.  And 26 U.S.C. 7422(a) precludes suits to re-\ncover taxes alleged to have been assessed or collected \nunlawfully before a taxpayer has properly sought a re-\nfund from the IRS. \n\n5 \n \n2. Following assessment, if a taxpayer who is \u201cliable \nto pay any tax neglects or refuses to pay,\u201d the IRS may \ngenerally \u201ccollect such tax\u201d by \u201clevy[ing] upon\u201d the tax-\npayer\u2019s property, i.e., seizing and selling it.  26 U.S.C. \n6331(a); see 26 U.S.C. 6331(b) (defining \u201clevy\u201d to \u201cin-\nclude[] the power of distraint and seizure by any means,\u201d \nand permitting the sale of \u201csuch property or rights to \nproperty\u201d); see also 26 U.S.C. 6321 (providing for tax \nliens).  Certain types of property\u2014including, with some \nexceptions, residences, welfare and unemployment ben-\nefits, and particular pensions\u2014are exempt from levies.  \nSee 26 U.S.C. 6334. \nBefore 1998, the Internal Revenue Code authorized \nthe IRS to levy upon taxpayer property without any \nprior opportunity for a hearing or other pre-collection \nprocess, so long as adequate post-deprivation proce-\ndures were available.  See Phillips v. Commissioner, \n283 U.S. 589, 595 (1931); 26 U.S.C. 6331(d) (1994).  In \n1998, however, Congress established procedures that \nthe IRS generally must follow before levying.  See Tax-\npayer Bill of Rights 3 (Taxpayer Bill of Rights), Pub. L. \nNo. 105-206, Tit. III, \u00a7 3401(b), 112 Stat. 747-749 (26 \nU.S.C. 6330); see also id. \u00a7 3401(a), 112 Stat. 746-747 (26 \nU.S.C. 6320) (substantially similar framework for IRS \nfiling of a notice of federal tax lien).  \nThose procedures are codified in Section 6330 of the \nCode, which is entitled \u201c[n]otice and opportunity for \nhearing before levy.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330.  Under those pro-\ncedures, \u201c[n]o levy may be made\u201d unless the IRS pro-\nvides the taxpayer with 30 days\u2019 notice and the oppor-\ntunity to request a hearing.  26 U.S.C. 6330(a)(1); see 26 \nU.S.C. 6330(a)(2) and (3).   \nIf the taxpayer makes such a request, an administra-\ntive hearing to review the proposed levy\u2014sometimes \n\n6 \n \ncalled a \u201ccollection due process hearing,\u201d Boechler, P.C. \nv. Commissioner, 596 U.S. 199, 202 (2022)\u2014is con-\nducted by an impartial officer in the Appeals Office.  26 \nU.S.C. 6330(b).  The taxpayer\u2019s request for a hearing \nsuspends \u201cthe levy actions which are the subject of the \nrequested hearing\u201d as well as the running of specified \nlimitations periods.  26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(1).   \nAt the hearing, the taxpayer may raise \u201cany relevant \nissue relating to the unpaid tax or the proposed levy,\u201d \nincluding \u201cchallenges to the appropriateness of collec-\ntion actions\u201d and \u201coffers of collection alternatives.\u201d  26 \nU.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(A)(ii) and (iii); see 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(4) \n(excluding certain issues that were previously litigated \nor qualify as frivolous).  If the taxpayer \u201cdid not receive \nany statutory notice of deficiency for [the relevant] tax \nliability or did not otherwise have an opportunity to dis-\npute such tax liability,\u201d she also may raise \u201cchallenges \nto the existence or amount of the underlying tax liabil-\nity.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B). \nAt the conclusion of a Section 6330 hearing, the  \nAppeals Office issues its \u201cdetermination,\u201d 26 U.S.C. \n6330(c)(3), which is \u201ca written notice\u201d reflecting wheth-\ner \u201ccollection by way of levy may proceed.\u201d  Lunsford v. \nCommissioner, 117 T.C. 159, 164-165 (2001).  The Ap-\npeals Office reaches its determination after considering \nstatutorily delineated factors, including whether the re-\nquirements of applicable law or administrative proce-\ndure have been met, 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(1) and (3)(A); the \nissues raised by the taxpayer, 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2) and \n(3); and \u201cwhether any proposed collection action bal-\nances the need for the efficient collection of taxes with \nthe legitimate concern of the [taxpayer] that any collec-\ntion action be no more intrusive than necessary,\u201d 26 \nU.S.C. 6330(c)(3)(C).   \n\n7 \n \nA taxpayer who is dissatisfied with a determination \nsustaining a levy may petition the United States Tax \nCourt \u201cfor review of such determination (and the Tax \nCourt shall have jurisdiction with respect to such mat-\nter).\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1).  The Tax Court\u2019s decision, \nin turn, is subject to review by a federal court of ap-\npeals.  26 U.S.C. 7482(a)(1). \n3. Although a taxpayer\u2019s request for a Section 6330 \nhearing suspends \u201cthe levy actions which are the sub-\nject of the requested hearing\u201d and certain limitations \nperiods, 26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(1), other mechanisms for tax \ncollection may proceed.  Most relevant here, when a tax-\npayer overpays the tax owed for a particular year, the \nIRS \u201cmay credit the amount of such overpayment\u201d \nagainst \u201cany liability in respect of an internal revenue \ntax on the part of the person who made the overpay-\nment\u201d instead of refunding that amount to the taxpayer.  \n26 U.S.C. 6402(a).   \nThat application of overpayment credits\u2014sometimes \nreferred to as an \u201coffset\u201d\u2014is an administrative action \ndistinct from the collection of a tax by a levy or lien on \nthe taxpayer\u2019s property.  See Belloff v. Commissioner, \n996 F.2d 607, 616 (2d Cir. 1993); Boyd v. Commissioner, \n124 T.C. 296, 300 (2005); 26 C.F.R. 301.6330\u20131(g)(2),  \nQ & A-G3.  A taxpayer may challenge the application of \ncredits through the traditional mechanism for disputing \nthe collection of a federal tax: filing a refund claim with \nthe IRS and, if necessary, a refund suit.  See 26 U.S.C. \n7422(a) and (d). \nB. The Present Controversy \n1. From 1993 to 2014, respondent was married to \nPatrick Gennardo.  Pet. App. 7a.  This case concerns the \n2010 tax year, for which respondent and Gennardo ulti-\nmately filed separate tax returns.  Ibid.  \n\n8 \n \na. In 2010 and 2011, respondent and Gennardo made \ntwo estimated tax payments, totaling $50,000, to the \nIRS for tax year 2010.  Pet. App. 8a.  First, the couple \nsubmitted an estimated tax payment of $20,000.  Ibid.  \nThe accompanying Form 1040-ES identified both of \ntheir names, but it did not indicate that they would be \nfiling separate returns, and it provided no instructions \non how to allocate the payment between them.  C.A. \nApp. 274, 314.  Second, Gennardo submitted a $30,000 \nbank check, which identified only Gennardo as the re-\nmitter.  Pet. App. 8a; see C.A. App. 274, 315.  The sub-\nject line of the accompanying cover letter identified \nboth respondent and Gennardo, but neither the check \nnor any accompanying documentation instructed the \nIRS to allocate any part of that payment to respondent.  \nC.A. App. 275, 315, 633, 638. \nb. On September 12, 2012, the couple filed separate \n(and untimely) 2010 federal income-tax returns.  Pet. \nApp. 7a; see C.A. App. 316-381.  Respondent did not claim \nany of the $50,000 in estimated tax payments on her re-\nturn, while Gennardo claimed $10,000 in estimated tax \npayments on his return.  C.A. App. 317, 331. Respond-\nent\u2019s and Gennardo\u2019s tax returns were prepared by the \nsame tax preparer.  Id. at 277. \nOn the same day that they submitted their separate \ntax returns, Gennardo made a written compromise offer \nto the IRS about his outstanding federal tax liabilities \nfor tax years 2007 through 2011.  C.A. App. 278, 382.  \nAlthough the offer covered years in which respondent \nand Gennardo had filed joint tax returns, Gennardo\u2019s  \noffer-in-compromise did not include respondent.  C.A. \nApp. 386.  Consistent with the terms of the offer and \nIRS rules governing payments related to pending of-\nfers, the IRS applied the full $50,000 in estimated tax \n\n9 \n \npayments to Gennardo\u2019s separate account.  Pet. App. \n8a; see C.A. App. 277-279, 310, 384, 466, 468, 473, 662; \nI.R.S. Notice 2006-68, 2006-31 I.R.B. 105.   \nc. In November 2012, respondent filed an amended \nreturn for the 2010 tax year showing that she owed an \nadditional $27,682.  Pet. App. 9a; see C.A. App. 279, 475, \n477.  For the first time, respondent\u2019s amended return \nalso claimed for herself the full $50,000 in estimated tax \npayments, yielding a claimed overpayment of $21,918 \nfor the 2010 tax year.  Pet. App. 9a; see C.A. App. 280, \n475.  Because the IRS had already allocated the $50,000 \nto Gennardo, it declined to apply the estimated pay-\nments to respondent\u2019s account.  C.A. App. 280.  Instead, \nthe IRS assessed the tax that respondent had reported \non her amended return, along with interest and a late-\nfiling penalty of $7020.  Ibid.   \n2. a. In 2013, the IRS sent respondent a notice and \ndemand for payment of her balance due.  C.A. App. 280.  \nRespondent failed to pay, and the IRS sent her a notice \nof its intent to levy on her property to collect the unpaid \ntaxes.  Pet. App. 70a-75a; C.A. App. 571-573.   \nRespondent invoked her right under Section 6330 to \nchallenge the proposed levy in a hearing before the Ap-\npeals Office.  Pet. App. 10a; C.A. App. 567-570.  She con-\ntended that the IRS should have applied the full $50,000 \nin estimated tax payments to her account, which would \nhave satisfied her self-reported underlying tax liability \nand resulted in a refund.  Pet. App. 10a; C.A. App. 567.   \nIn 2014, after a hearing, the Appeals Office issued a \ndetermination sustaining the IRS\u2019s proposed levy, ex-\nplaining that the estimated tax payments could not be \napplied to respondent\u2019s account because they had been \ncredited to Gennardo\u2019s account.  Pet. App. 61a-67a.  Re-\nspondent petitioned the Tax Court for review, and in \n\n10 \n \n2016, the Tax Court remanded to the Appeals Office for \nclarification of several issues.  C.A. App. 16; Pet. App. \n50a-60a.  On remand, the Appeals Office reaffirmed its \nprior determination to sustain the proposed levy, ex-\nplaining in a 2017 supplemental notice of determination \nthat the estimated tax payments had been properly al-\nlocated to Gennardo.  Pet. App. 44a-49a. \nb. While respondent\u2019s pre-levy proceedings were \npending before the Appeals Office and the Tax Court, \nrespondent overpaid her taxes for 2013 and subsequent \ntax years.  Pet. App. 12a-13a.  The IRS exercised its au-\nthority under Section 6402(a) to credit her overpay-\nments in those years against her 2010 tax liability.  Ibid.  \nBy April 15, 2019, the credits transferred from later tax \nyears had reduced the balance due on respondent\u2019s 2010 \nliability to $0.  Id. at 13a. \nIn March 2020, the IRS moved to dismiss as moot the \npre-levy proceeding before the Tax Court, explaining \nthat respondent\u2019s 2010 tax liability had been satisfied \nand the IRS therefore \u201cno longer intend[ed] to pursue \nthe proposed collection action.\u201d  Pet. App. 42a; see C.A. \nDoc. 5-4, at 450 (July 21, 2022) (motion to dismiss).   \nThe Tax Court granted the motion and dismissed the \ncase.  Pet. App. 40a-43a.  The court explained that the \n\u201ccase is moot\u201d \u201c[b]ecause there is no unpaid liability for \nthe determination year upon which a levy could be \nbased, and [the IRS] is no longer pursuing the proposed \ncollection action.\u201d  Id. at 43a (citing McLane v. Commis-\nsioner, 24 F.4th 316 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 143 S. Ct. \n408 (2022); Greene-Thapedi v. Commissioner, 126 T.C. \n1, 7 (2006)).  The court acknowledged that respondent \ncontinued to argue that the IRS should have credited \nthe estimated payments to her, but the court reasoned \nthat because it did not \u201chave jurisdiction to determine \n\n11 \n \nan overpayment or to order a refund or credit of tax \npaid in a section 6330 proceeding, this is not the proper \nforum to determine whether, and the extent to which, if \nany, the underlying liability has been overpaid.\u201d  Ibid.  \nThe court observed that respondent could still \u201cpursue \nany refund to which she might be entitled through tra-\nditional Federal income procedures, including if neces-\nsary, initiating a case in a different Federal court.\u201d  \nIbid. \n3. The court of appeals vacated the Tax Court\u2019s or-\nder of dismissal and remanded for the Tax Court to de-\ntermine whether respondent was entitled to the esti-\nmated tax payments that the IRS had allocated to Gen-\nnardo.  Pet. App. 1a-39a.   \nAlthough the court of appeals acknowledged that \n\u201cthe Tax Court need not hear a moot case,\u201d Pet. App. \n16a, the court of appeals held that the proceedings be-\nfore the Tax Court are \u201cnot moot,\u201d id. at 2a.  In a part \nof the opinion joined by only two members of the panel, \nthe court of appeals concluded that the Tax Court has \njurisdiction in a Section 6330 pre-levy proceeding to re-\nview a taxpayer\u2019s \u201cunderlying tax liability,\u201d id. at 26a \n(quoting 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B)), and that the statute \ndoes not \u201csuggest that a taxpayer\u2019s right to challenge \nthe existence or amount of her underlying tax becomes \nmoot once the levy is no longer being enforced or the \ntax is satisfied,\u201d id. at 26a-27a.  The court of appeals \nreasoned that even though the IRS is no longer seeking \nto take respondent\u2019s property by levy, the Tax Court \nretains jurisdiction to \u201cdeclare that [respondent] had a \nright to the estimated payments.\u201d  Id. at 37a.  The court \nof appeals acknowledged that its holding is contrary to \nthose of the Fourth and D.C. Circuits, which have held \nthat a Section 6330 proceeding in the Tax Court is moot \n\n12 \n \nwhen the IRS no longer seeks to levy on a taxpayer\u2019s \nproperty.  Id. at 27a (citing McLane, 24 F.4th at 319 (4th \nCir.); Willson v. Commissioner, 805 F.3d 316, 321 (D.C. \nCir. 2015)).   \nIn a part of the opinion joined by all three members \nof the panel, the court of appeals alternatively con-\ncluded that the case is not moot on the theory that the \nTax Court has jurisdiction to determine whether the \nIRS validly exercised its authority under Section 6402 \nto use respondent\u2019s later-year overpayments to offset \nher 2010 tax liability.  Pet. App. 19a-25a.  Respondent \nhad made only a passing reference to the validity of the \noffsets in her reply brief, see Resp. C.A. Reply Br. 16-\n17, but after oral argument, the court of appeals ap-\npointed an amicus to address the question (along with \nsix other issues), C.A. Doc. 45 (June 1, 2023).   \nIn holding that the Tax Court may review the appli-\ncation of credits under Section 6402, the court of ap-\npeals relied on \u201can implicit grant\u201d of jurisdiction, ob-\nserving that \u201c[i]t may be that Congress has not explic-\nitly granted the Tax Court such power.\u201d  Pet. App. 20a.  \nSpecifically, the court of appeals reasoned that Section \n6402 \u201ccarries forward the common law of setoffs,\u201d which \nmeans that the Tax Court has implicit jurisdiction to re-\nview the application of credits in a pre-levy proceeding, \neven absent a proposed levy.  Id. at 21a.1   \nThe court of appeals then considered the application \nof Section 6402 credits to respondent\u2019s 2010 tax liability \nin the first instance.  Even though Section 6402 allows \n \n1  Although the court of appeals used the terms \u201coffset\u201d and \u201cset-\noff\u200a\u201d interchangeably, the statute uses \u201coffset\u201d to refer to an over-\npayment credit, see 26 U.S.C. 6402, while \u201csetoff\u200a\u201d is typically used \nto describe the common-law principle, see, e.g., United States v. \nMunsey Trust Co., 332 U.S. 234, 239 (1947). \n\n13 \n \nthe application of credits to \u201cany liability,\u201d 26 U.S.C. \n6402(a), the court determined that the offset was \u201cinva-\nlid and without legal effect\u201d because common-law setoff \nprinciples do not apply to disputed debts, Pet. App. 25a.  \nHaving concluded that respondent\u2019s \u201ctax obligation was \nnot properly set off,\u201d the court determined that her tax \nliability remains, and she may \u201cchallenge the IRS\u2019s ap-\nplication of the estimated payments\u201d in a Section 6330 \nproceeding.  Id. at 19a.   \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nA pre-levy proceeding under 26 U.S.C. 6330 is moot \nwhen there is no longer a live dispute over the proposed \nlevy that gave rise to the proceeding. \nA. The Tax Court is a court of limited jurisdiction, \ncapable of exercising only the jurisdiction expressly \nconferred on it by Congress.  The Tax Court has been \ngranted jurisdiction over a \u201cpetition  * * *  for review\u201d \nof the Appeals Office\u2019s \u201cdetermination\u201d whether a par-\nticular levy may proceed.  26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1).  When \nthe IRS no longer seeks to proceed by levy\u2014such that \nthere is no live dispute over \u201cthe levy action[] which  \n[is] the subject of the requested hearing,\u201d 26 U.S.C. \n6330(e)(1)\u2014the taxpayer\u2019s challenge is moot, and the \nTax Court lacks jurisdiction to resolve it. \nAt every step in the Section 6330 process, the statu-\ntory text squarely focuses on the question whether a \nlevy may go forward.  The statute mandates that the \ntaxpayer receive notice and an opportunity for a hear-\ning \u201cbefore levy\u201d; it requires that certain levy-related \ninformation be conveyed in the notice; and it instructs \nthat the Appeals Office\u2019s \u201cdetermination\u201d must \u201ctake \ninto consideration,\u201d inter alia, \u201cwhether any proposed \ncollection action balances the need for the efficient col-\nlection of taxes with the legitimate concern of the per-\n\n14 \n \nson that any collection action be no more intrusive than \nnecessary.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(a) and (c)(3)(C).  Once the \nAppeals Office determines whether the levy may pro-\nceed, Section 6330 authorizes the Tax Court to review \n\u201csuch determination.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1).  But where \nthere is no longer a live dispute over a levy, there is \nnothing left for the Tax Court to do, and the case is \nmoot. \nB. That understanding is consistent with Section \n6330\u2019s history and its role in the Internal Revenue Code.  \nCongress enacted Section 6330 to ensure that taxpayers \nhave a pre-deprivation opportunity to contest levies.  \nSection 6330 was not designed to, and did not, provide a \nbroader means for taxpayers to dispute their tax liabil-\nity untethered from proposed levies. \nC. The court of appeals\u2019 and respondent\u2019s contrary \narguments lack merit.  Both the court and respondent \nhave suggested that the Tax Court retains jurisdiction \nabsent a live dispute over a levy because, in some cir-\ncumstances, Section 6330(c)(2)(B) permits a taxpayer to \nraise at a pre-levy hearing \u201cchallenges to the existence \nor amount of the underlying tax liability.\u201d  26 U.S.C. \n6330(c)(2)(B); see Pet. App. 19a; Br. in Opp. 14.  But, as \nthat text underscores, a taxpayer\u2019s \u201cunderlying tax lia-\nbility\u201d must underlie the proposed collection action\u2014\nthat is, the levy.  The statute thus does not support treat-\ning a taxpayer\u2019s challenge to her \u201cunderlying tax liabil-\nity\u201d as providing a freestanding basis for Tax Court ju-\nrisdiction.  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B).  Rather, where Sec-\ntion 6330(c)(2)(B) applies, it simply supplies one \u201ccon-\nsideration\u201d that the Appeals Office must \u201ctake into\u201d ac-\ncount when issuing the \u201cdetermination\u201d whether the \nproposed levy may proceed.  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B) and \n(3).  When there is no live dispute over a proposed levy, \n\n15 \n \nthere is no Tax Court jurisdiction to address the \u201cun-\nderlying\u201d question.  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B). \nThe court of appeals alternatively held that the Tax \nCourt has \u201cimplicit\u201d jurisdiction to review the IRS\u2019s al-\nlocation of respondent\u2019s later-year overpayments to off-\nset her tax liability.  Pet. App. 20a.  Respondent has not \ndefended that rationale in this Court, and for good rea-\nson.  Congress must expressly provide for Tax Court \njurisdiction by statute, and no statute grants that court \nauthority to review Section 6402 credits in a Section \n6330 proceeding.  Even if the Tax Court could conduct \nsuch review, it still could not provide meaningful relief. \nD. This case is moot.  When respondent failed to pay \nher self-reported 2010 tax debt, the IRS proposed to \ncollect her liability by administrative levy.  Respondent \nthen invoked her right to a pre-levy proceeding under \nSection 6330.  But while that proceeding was ongoing, \nrespondent overpaid her taxes for subsequent tax \nyears, and the IRS used its authority under Section \n6402 to credit those overpayments against respondent\u2019s \n2010 tax debt.  With no debt remaining, the IRS aban-\ndoned the levy that was \u201cthe subject of the requested \nhearing,\u201d 26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(1).  The Tax Court therefore \nlacked jurisdiction to review the Appeals Office\u2019s \u201cde-\ntermination\u201d that the levy could proceed.  26 U.S.C. \n6330(d)(1).   \nThat does not, however, leave respondent without a \njudicial remedy:  She may dispute the IRS\u2019s allocation \nof the 2010 estimated payments and her subsequent \noverpayments in a refund suit, the traditional mecha-\nnism for such challenges (and the one that she could \nhave used if the IRS had never proposed a levy).  But \nabsent a live dispute over a potential levy, Section 6330 \nhas no role to play. \n\n16 \n \nARGUMENT \nA PRE-LEVY PROCEEDING UNDER 26 U.S.C. 6330 IS MOOT \nWHEN THERE IS NO LONGER A LIVE DISPUTE OVER THE \nPROPOSED LEVY THAT GAVE RISE TO THE PROCEEDING \nThe court of appeals held that a pre-levy proceeding \nunder 26 U.S.C. 6330 may continue even when there is \nno longer a live dispute over the proposed levy that gave \nrise to the proceeding.  Pet. App. 16a-39a.  That holding \nis incorrect.  Section 6330 is narrowly trained on the ap-\npropriateness of a proposed levy.  When the parties no \nlonger dispute the propriety of such a levy, the proceed-\ning becomes moot.  This Court should reverse. \nA. The Text Of Section 6330 Makes Clear That A Pre-Levy \nProceeding Is Moot When The IRS No Longer Seeks To \nLevy On A Taxpayer\u2019s Property \n1. The United States Tax Court is \u201ca court of limited \njurisdiction.\u201d  Commissioner v. McCoy, 484 U.S. 3, 7 (1987) \n(per curiam).  It may exercise \u201conly the power \u2018expressly \nconferred by Congress.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. 14a (quoting Sunoco \nInc. v. Commissioner, 663 F.3d 181, 187 (3d Cir. 2011)); \nsee 26 U.S.C. 7442; see, e.g., Commissioner v. Gooch \nMilling & Elevator Co., 320 U.S. 418, 422 (1943) (dis-\ncussing the Tax Court\u2019s predecessor, the Board of Tax \nAppeals).  \u201cThus, if a case raises a question within the \njurisdictional purview of the tax court, and that ques-\ntion is subsequently resolved, the case is moot\u201d\u2014and \nthe Tax Court lacks jurisdiction\u2014\u201cnotwithstanding the \nexistence of other live controversies between the tax-\npayer and the IRS that do not fall within the tax court\u2019s \njurisdiction.\u201d  Willson v. Commissioner, 805 F.3d 316, \n320 (D.C. Cir. 2015). \nHere, it is undisputed that the relevant jurisdiction-\nconferring provision is 26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1).  See Pet. 8; \nBr. in Opp. 14; see also Pet. App. 14a.  Section 6330 pro-\n\n17 \n \nvides a mechanism for \u201cthe taxpayer [to] challenge [a] \nlevy or offer collection alternatives\u201d before a seizure of \nthe taxpayer\u2019s property occurs.  Boechler, P.C. v. Com-\nmissioner, 596 U.S. 199, 202 (2022).  That procedure\u2014\nalong with the similar one for tax liens, 26 U.S.C. 6320\u2014\nis only necessary when the IRS is attempting to use a \nlien or levy to enforce collection of a tax liability.  If the \nIRS\u2019s Appeals Office issues a \u201cdetermination\u201d that the \nproposed levy may proceed, Section 6330(d)(1) grants \nthe Tax Court \u201cjurisdiction\u201d over the taxpayer\u2019s peti-\ntion for review of \u201csuch determination.\u201d  26 U.S.C. \n6330(d)(1); see 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3).   \nThe entire point of the Section 6330 proceeding is to \ndetermine whether the IRS may go forward with its \nproposed levy.  Thus, at every step, the statutory text is \nnarrowly focused on that question.  Congress supplied \nthe title for the section:  \u201cNotice and opportunity for \nhearing before levy.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330; Taxpayer Bill of \nRights \u00a7 3401(b), 112 Stat. 747.  Section 6330(a)(1) di-\nrectly ties the right to a hearing to the proposed levy, \nproviding that \u201c[n]o levy may be made on any property \nor right to property of any person unless the Secretary \nhas notified such person in writing of their right to a \nhearing under this section before such levy is made.\u201d  26 \nU.S.C. 6330(a)(1); see Greene-Thapedi v. Commissioner, \n126 T.C. 1, 6, 8 (2006).  Notice of the proposed levy must \nbe given \u201cnot less than 30 days before the day of the \nfirst levy,\u201d and it must include a variety of levy-related \ninformation, including \u201cthe proposed action\u201d; \u201cthe pro-\nvisions of [Title 26] relating to levy and sale of prop-\nerty\u201d; \u201cthe procedures applicable to the levy and sale of \nproperty under [Title 26]\u201d; \u201cthe administrative appeals \navailable to the taxpayer with respect to such levy and \nsale\u201d; \u201cthe alternatives available to taxpayers which \n\n18 \n \ncould prevent levy on property\u201d; and \u201cthe provisions of \n[Title 26] and procedures relating to redemption of \nproperty and release of liens on property.\u201d  26 U.S.C. \n6330(a)(2) and (3)(C).  The exceptions to Section 6330 \nalso reflect its focus on levies.  The pre-levy procedure \nis unavailable if the Secretary finds that \u201cthe collection \nof tax is in jeopardy,\u201d or if the case concerns certain lev-\nies imposed on States, \u201cdisqualified employment tax \nlev[ies],\u201d or \u201cFederal contractor lev[ies].\u201d  26 U.S.C. \n6330(f\u200a).  In those instances, \u201cthe taxpayer shall be given \nthe opportunity for the hearing described in [Section \n6330] within a reasonable period of time after the levy.\u201d  \nIbid.   \nIf no exception applies and the taxpayer invokes her \nstatutory right to a pre-levy hearing, \u201cthe levy actions \nwhich are the subject of the requested hearing\u201d and cer-\ntain limitations periods \u201cshall be suspended for the pe-\nriod during which such hearing, and appeals therein, are \npending.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(1); see 26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(2) \n(providing an exception to this rule).  Because the levy \nis the \u201csubject of the requested hearing,\u201d ibid., it would \nmake little sense for the action to continue once the IRS \nno longer seeks to enforce the levy.  \nThe outcome of the \u201cCollection Due Process\u201d or \n\u201cCDP hearing\u201d under Section 6330 is a \u201c\u200a\u2018determination\u2019 \nregarding the legitimacy of the proposed levy.\u201d  Will-\nson, 805 F.3d 318, 320 (quoting 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3)); \nsee McLane v. Commissioner, 24 F.4th 316, 318-319 \n(4th Cir.), cert. denied, 143 S. Ct. 408 (2022) (explaining \nthat \u201cthe Appeals Office determines in the first instance \nwhether the IRS\u2019s collection action may go forward\u201d).  \nAt the hearing, the taxpayer may raise \u201cany relevant \nissue relating to the unpaid tax or the proposed levy,\u201d \nincluding \u201cappropriate spousal defenses,\u201d \u201cchallenges to \n\n19 \n \nthe appropriateness of collection actions,\u201d and \u201coffers of \ncollection alternatives.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(A).  The \nAppeals Office\u2019s \u201c\u200adetermination,\u201d in turn, \u201cshall take \ninto consideration  * * *  whether any proposed collec-\ntion action balances the need for the efficient collection \nof taxes with the legitimate concern of the person that \nany collection action be no more intrusive than neces-\nsary.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3)(C).   \nIn certain cases where the taxpayer has not previ-\nously had the opportunity to dispute her tax liability, \nthe taxpayer may also raise \u201cchallenges to the existence \nor amount of the underlying tax liability.\u201d  26 U.S.C. \n6330(c)(2)(B).  But like the other issues that the tax-\npayer may raise, such challenges to the taxpayer\u2019s un-\nderlying liability are simply \u201cconsideration[s]\u201d that feed \ninto the ultimate \u201cdetermination\u201d whether the levy may \nproceed.  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3)(C).   \nIn this case, for example, the Notice of Determina-\ntion that the Appeals Office sent respondent recounted \nthe Appeals Office\u2019s \u201cdetermination  * * *  that the pro-\nposed levy  * * *  balances the need for efficient collec-\ntion of taxes with [respondent\u2019s] legitimate concern that \nany collection action be no more intrusive than neces-\nsary.\u201d  Pet. App. 63a.  And it stated that \u201cthe Final No-\ntice of [I]ntent to Levy [was therefore] being sus-\ntained.\u201d  Ibid.; see id. at 64a (\u201cAppeals has determined \nto sustain the action (levy).\u201d). \n2. The statutory focus on the appropriateness of a \nproposed levy follows the case to the Tax Court.  Section \n6330(d)(1) provides that \u201cwithin 30 days of a determina-\ntion under this section\u201d\u2014that is, a determination \nwhether the levy may go forward\u2014the taxpayer may \n\u201cpetition the Tax Court for review of such determina-\ntion.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1).  And crucially, the statute \n\n20 \n \nvests the Tax Court with \u201cjurisdiction with respect to \nsuch matter,\u201d ibid.\u2014i.e., the \u201cpetition for review of [the \nAppeals Office\u2019s] determination.\u201d  Boechler, 596 U.S. at \n204; see, e.g., Lunsford v. Commissioner, 117 T.C. 159, \n164 (2001) (explaining that the Tax Court\u2019s \u201cjurisdiction  \n* * *  is established when there is a written notice that \nembodies a determination to proceed with the collection \nof the taxes in issue, and a timely filed petition\u201d there-\nfrom).  Thus, the Tax Court proceedings\u2014like the ear-\nlier Appeals Office proceedings\u2014are squarely focused \non whether the IRS may enforce a proposed levy. \n3. Once the IRS has determined that it is no longer \nseeking to levy on the taxpayer\u2019s property, there is \nnothing left for the Tax Court to do.  Such a decision not \nto pursue a levy is \u201cthe very relief [the taxpayer] osten-\nsibly sought when [she] requested a [Section 6330] \nhearing to challenge the proposed levy in the first \nplace,\u201d and it is \u201call the relief that section 6330 author-\nizes the tax court to grant.\u201d  Willson, 805 F.3d at 321.  \nSection 6330(e)(1) provides that if a taxpayer requests \na hearing, \u201cthe levy actions which are the subject of the \nrequested hearing  * * *  shall be suspended\u201d during the \npendency of the hearing and any appeals.  26 U.S.C. \n6330(e)(1).  The statute further states that \u201c[n]otwith-\nstanding the provisions of section 7421(a)\u201d\u2014the Tax \nAnti-Injunction Act\u2014\u201cthe beginning of a levy or pro-\nceeding during\u201d that period of suspension \u201cmay be en-\njoined by a proceeding in the proper court, including the \nTax Court\u201d if an appeal to the Tax Court is timely filed.  \nIbid.  But the timely appeal triggers Tax Court jurisdic-\ntion to enjoin other actions \u201conly in respect of the un-\npaid tax or proposed levy to which the determination \nbeing appealed relates.\u201d  Ibid.  And that power ceases \nto matter when the IRS has already decided not to pur-\n\n21 \n \nsue the proposed levy because it is satisfied that the tax \nhas been paid. \nThus, when the IRS determines that it no longer \nneeds or intends to take the taxpayer\u2019s property by \nlevy, the pre-levy proceeding becomes moot.  That is \ntrue whether the liability has been \u201cabated,\u201d see Will-\nson, 805 F.3d at 320 (IRS ceased pursuing levy based on \nincorrect assessment); Byers v. Commissioner, 740 \nF.3d 668, 679 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (similar); or has been sat-\nisfied with other taxpayer funds, see McLane, 24 F.4th \nat 319; Greene-Thapedi, 126 T.C. at 7.   \nAnd the proceeding remains moot regardless of \nwhether the taxpayer contends that the IRS has made \nan error or continues to owe her money.  See Willson, \n805 F.3d at 320; McLane, 24 F.4th at 319 n.*; Greene-\nThapedi, 126 T.C. at 7.  The taxpayer may make those \narguments in a post-deprivation suit for a refund\u2014the \ntraditional mechanism for disputing the assessment or \ncollection of a federal tax.  See 26 U.S.C. 7422(a); 28 \nU.S.C. 1346(a)(1), 1491(a)(1).  But the Section 6330 pro-\nceeding is a rare pre-deprivation mechanism for chal-\nlenging a particular method of a collection: a proposed \nlevy.  Once the IRS no longer seeks to deprive the tax-\npayer of any property by levy, the issue that prompted \nthe Section 6330 proceeding is no longer \u201c\u200a\u2018live,\u2019\u200a\u201d and the \nparties have ceased to have any \u201clegally cognizable in-\nterest\u201d in a determination regarding the permissibility \nof the levy.  Chafin v. Chafin, 568 U.S. 165, 172 (2013) \n(citation omitted).2   \n \n2 Although it is not organized under Article III, the Tax Court has \nconcluded that \u201c[t]he case or controversy requirement under Article \nIII \u2018presumptively\u2019 applies in the Tax Court.\u201d  Pet. App. 15a (quot-\ning Battat v. Commissioner, 148 T.C. 32, 46 (2017)).  This Court \nneed not determine whether the Tax Court\u2019s understanding is cor-\n\n22 \n \nB. Section 6330\u2019s History And Function Within The Inter-\nnal Revenue Code Confirm That A Pre-levy Proceeding \nBecomes Moot When There Is No Longer A Live Dispute \nOver A Proposed Levy  \n1. As discussed above, the default means for a tax-\npayer to dispute the assessment or collection of a federal \ntax is a post-payment refund suit.  See pp. 3-4, supra.  Be-\nfore 1998, the Internal Revenue Code authorized the \nIRS to levy upon taxpayer property without any prior \nopportunity for a hearing or other pre-collection pro-\ncess, so long as the taxpayer was given 30 days\u2019 notice.  \nSee 26 U.S.C. 6331(d) (1994); see, e.g., Iames v. Com-\nmissioner, 850 F.3d 160, 165 (4th Cir. 2017) (describing \n\u201cthe Commissioner\u2019s significant and previously unfet-\ntered power to levy\u201d).   \nThat changed in 1998, when Congress enacted \u201ca \nprocedural protection for taxpayers to oppose IRS col-\nlection actions\u201d before they occurred.  Jeffers v. Com-\nmissioner, 992 F.3d 649, 655 (7th Cir. 2021).  In making \nthat change, Congress\u2019s \u201cgeneral focus\u201d was \u201con the \nCommissioner\u2019s collection of a predetermined liability.\u201d  \n \nrect.  Regardless of whether Article III constraints apply, \u201cthe con-\ntroversy must also fall within the [Tax Court\u2019s] statutory grant of \njurisdiction.\u201d  Willson, 805 F.3d at 320.  And once the IRS has de-\ntermined that it will not pursue a levy, the Tax Court lacks statutory \njurisdiction over a Section 6330 proceeding.  This Court may resolve \nthe question presented on that basis.  See Sinochem Int\u2019l Co. v. Ma-\nlaysia Int\u2019l Shipping Corp., 549 U.S. 422, 430-431 (2007).    \n In any event, assuming that Article III principles do apply, the \ncase is moot.  Respondent has no live interest in contesting a with-\ndrawn levy, and the only relief that the Tax Court could provide\u2014a \ndetermination that the levy could not go forward, and an injunction \nagainst it\u2014would not constitute \u201ceffectual relief,\u201d Campbell-Ewald \nCo. v. Gomez, 577 U.S. 153, 161 (2016) (citation omitted), after the \nproposed levy has already been withdrawn.   \n\n23 \n \nIames, 850 F.3d at 165.  That is, Congress designed Sec-\ntion 6330 to review a proposed levy, not to provide a \nmore general opportunity for a taxpayer to challenge an \nassessment of tax. \nThe pre-levy procedures in Section 6330 were under-\nstood as \u201cestablish[ing] formal procedures designed to \ninsure due process where the IRS seeks to collect taxes \nby levy.\u201d  S. Rep. No. 174, 105th Cong., 2d Sess. 67 (1998); \nsee ibid. (\u201c[T]he Committee believes that the IRS \nshould afford taxpayers adequate notice of collection ac-\ntivity and a meaningful hearing before the IRS deprives \nthem of their property.\u201d); see also H.R. Rep. No. 599, \n105th Cong., 2d Sess. 263 (1998) (describing the new \nprovision in similar terms).  \u201c[T]he entire purpose be-\nhind the creation of [Section 6330] was to provide tax-\npayers with greater due process to contest the IRS\u2019s \nlevy and sale of their property.\u201d  Zapara v. Commis-\nsioner, 652 F.3d 1042, 1045 (9th Cir. 2011).  Nothing in \nthe history of the provision suggests that Congress in-\ntended for the pre-levy proceeding to continue where \nthere is no longer a live dispute over a proposed levy. \n2. That understanding of Section 6330 is consistent \nwith its important but limited function within the Inter-\nnal Revenue Code.  Challenges to the assessment of a \ntax are generally the province of post-payment refund \nsuits, and in the case of certain taxes, pre-payment de-\nficiency actions.  See pp. 3-4, supra.  The Internal Rev-\nenue Code and other statutes protect that principle \nthrough provisions like the Tax Anti-Injunction Act, 26 \nU.S.C. 7421(a), and the tax exception to the Declaratory \nJudgment Act, 28 U.S.C. 2201(a), which generally pre-\nclude suits for injunctive and declaratory relief regard-\ning the assessment or collection of taxes.  Understood \nagainst that backdrop, Section 6330 is a limited mecha-\n\n24 \n \nnism to ensure that a taxpayer may \u201cchallenge a levy \nbefore seizure and sale,\u201d Pet. App. 4a\u2014not an addi-\ntional avenue to seek relief in the absence of a live dis-\npute over a levy.   \nThere are tens of thousands of Section 6330 proceed-\nings each year.  See Treasury Inspector Gen. for Tax \nAdmin., U.S. Dep\u2019t of the Treasury, Report No. 2023-\n10-038, Review of the IRS Independent Office of Ap-\npeals Collection Due Process Program 7 (July 2023), \nperma.cc/DVL7-9HA8 (reporting 28,349 closed Section \n6330 cases in 2023).  Allowing those proceedings to con-\ntinue even when the IRS no longer seeks to levy on a \ntaxpayer\u2019s property could convert many of them from a \nlimited opportunity for pre-deprivation review into a \nmore general forum for considering challenges to tax li-\nability.  Nothing in the text or history of Section 6330 \nsupports that end-run around the calibrated statutory \nframework that generally provides for post-payment \nadjudication of disputes over tax liability. \nC. The Contrary Arguments Offered By Respondent And \nThe Court Of Appeals Lack Merit \nThe court of appeals recognized that \u201cthe Tax Court \nneed not hear a moot case.\u201d  Pet. App. 16a.  But the \ncourt held that a pre-levy proceeding under Section \n6330 does not become moot when the IRS \u201cwithdr[aws] \nits levy.\u201d  Id. at 25a.  That was error, and neither the \ncourt of appeals nor respondent has offered any persua-\nsive support for the court\u2019s holding. \n1. The Tax Court lacks jurisdiction to consider a tax-\npayer\u2019s \u201cunderlying tax liability\u201d when there is no \nlive dispute over a proposed levy \na. In a portion of its opinion joined by only two mem-\nbers of the panel, the court of appeals held that the Sec-\n\n25 \n \ntion 6330 proceeding in this case is not moot because re-\nspondent still disputes whether the IRS \u201cerroneously \nallocated\u201d the estimated payments to Gennardo rather \nthan respondent.  Pet. App. 19a.  The court relied on \nSection 6330(c)(2)(B), which, in certain circumstances, \nallows a taxpayer to raise at a Section 6330 hearing \u201cthe \nexistence or amount of the underlying tax liability.\u201d  26 \nU.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B).  Respondent likewise contends \n(Br. in Opp. 14) that the Tax Court may \u201cresolve any \ndispute about the taxpayer\u2019s underlying tax liability \nthat the taxpayer properly raised before the Appeals \nOffice\u201d\u2014even if the IRS no longer seeks to enforce the \nlevy that gave rise to the Section 6330 proceeding.3 \nThat argument ignores the text and context of Sec-\ntion 6330(c)(2)(B).  That provision comes into play \n \n3 The parties have disagreed about which subsection of Section \n6330 governs respondent\u2019s challenge to the IRS\u2019s allocation of  \nestimated payments.  See Pet. Reply Br. 4 n.2.  While respondent \nrelies on Section 6330(c)(2)(B)\u2019s reference to \u201cchallenges to the ex-\nistence or amount of the underlying tax liability,\u201d id. at 4, the gov-\nernment disputes that characterization because the liability  \nitself\u2014respondent\u2019s self-reported 2010 tax\u2014is not in question.  \nSee Gov\u2019t C.A. Supp. Br. 24-25.  Because respondent claims that the \nagreed-upon liability should have been paid through the estimated \npayments, the government views that argument as an \u201cissue relat-\ning to the unpaid tax.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(A); see Melasky v. Com-\nmissioner, 151 T.C. 89, 92 (2018) (\u201cA question about whether the \nIRS properly credited a payment is not a challenge to a tax liability; \ni.e., the amount of tax imposed by the Code for a particular year.  It \nis instead a question of whether the liability remains unpaid.\u201d).  The \nCourt need not, however, decide this dispute to resolve the question \npresented.  As discussed in the text, even under respondent\u2019s char-\nacterization, the Section 6330 proceeding in this case is moot be-\ncause a taxpayer may challenge her \u201cunderlying tax liability\u201d only \nin connection with a determination whether a proposed levy may \nproceed. \n\n26 \n \nwhere the taxpayer seeks to dispute an \u201cunderlying tax \nliability.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B).  For a \u201cliability\u201d to \nexist, the taxpayer must still owe a debt to the IRS.  See \nWebster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary of the \nEnglish Language 1302 (1993) (Webster\u2019s Third) (defin-\ning \u201cliability\u201d as \u201can amount that is owed whether pay-\nable in money, other property, or services\u201d); see also \nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary 1095 (12th ed. 2024) (defining \n\u201cliability\u201d as \u201c[a] financial or pecuniary obligation in a \nspecificed amount; DEBT <tax liability>\u201d).   \nCrucially, for a taxpayer\u2019s liability to be \u201cunderly-\ning,\u201d it must be \u201clying under or beneath,\u201d \u201cbe at the ba-\nsis of,\u201d or \u201cform the foundation of\u200a\u201d something else.  \nWebster\u2019s Third 2489 (definitions of \u201cunderlying\u201d and \n\u201cunderlie\u201d).  In the context of Section 6330, the tax lia-\nbility is \u201cunderlying\u201d the proposed \u201clevy actions which \nare the subject of the requested hearing.\u201d  26 U.S.C. \n6330(c)(2)(B) and (e)(1).  When there is not a proposed \nlevy, any dispute about tax liability ceases to be the \nfoundation for something else.  There is accordingly no \n\u201cunderlying tax liability\u201d for purposes of 26 U.S.C. \n6330(c)(2)(B). \nAs the Fourth Circuit has correctly explained, the \nphrase \u201cunderlying tax liability\u201d must be understood in \n\u201cthe specific context in which that language is used,\u201d \nand in Section 6330, \u201cthe \u2018specific context\u2019 is the IRS\u2019s \nattempt to collect via lien or levy.\u201d  McLane, 24 F.4th at \n319 (quoting Yates v. United States, 574 U.S. 528, 537 \n(2015)).  Where Section 6330(c)(2)(B) applies, a tax-\npayer may challenge the existence or amount of her \n\u201cunderlying tax liability,\u201d 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B)\u2014just \nas she may raise \u201cany relevant issue relating to the un-\npaid tax,\u201d 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(A).  But those challenges \nare available for purposes of informing the determina-\n\n27 \n \ntion whether the proposed levy may proceed.  The stat-\nute therefore requires the Appeals Office to \u201ctake\u201d \nthose factors \u201cinto consideration\u201d in making its \u201cdeter-\nmination\u201d about the levy.  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3).  And the \nTax Court will in turn review \u201csuch determination\u201d on \nappeal.  26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1).  If the Tax Court con-\ncludes that a taxpayer owes less than the IRS has cal-\nculated, that conclusion will affect the propriety of the \nproposed collection action because the IRS cannot col-\nlect more than is owed.    \nBut that is the extent of the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction \nunder Section 6330.  Section 6330 does not identify a \nchallenge to the taxpayer\u2019s \u201cunderlying tax liability\u201d as \na freestanding issue.  When the IRS is not seeking a levy, \nthere is no underlying liability, and Section 6330(c)(2)(B) \nhas no role to play.  In that instance, the taxpayer can-\nnot use a Section 6330 proceeding as an \u201cindependent \nbasis to challenge the existence or amount\u201d of her tax \ndebt, Greene-Thapedi, 126 T.C. at 8\u2014just as she could \nnot have used Section 6330 to seek such findings if no \nlevy had been proposed in the first place.  See McLane, \n24 F.4th at 319; Willson, 805 F.3d at 320-321; Byers, 740 \nF.3d at 679.   \nb. Echoing the court of appeals (Pet. App. 33a-36a), \nrespondent has suggested (Br. in Opp. 19) that her case \nis not moot because the Tax Court \u201chad authority to is-\nsue declaratory relief as to [her] underlying liability.\u201d  \nBut even where declaratory relief is generally available, \nit \u201cdoes not \u2018extend\u2019 the \u2018jurisdiction\u2019 of the federal \ncourts.\u201d  Medtronic, Inc. v. Mirowski Family Ventures, \nLLC, 571 U.S. 191, 197 (2014) (quoting Skelly Oil Co. v. \nPhillips Petroleum Co., 339 U.S. 667, 671 (1950)).  And \nhere, the Tax Court lacks the authority to provide the \ndeclaration that respondent seeks. \n\n28 \n \nCongress has granted only limited powers of declar-\natory relief with respect to federal taxes.  The Declara-\ntory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. 2201(a), bars declaratory \njudgments \u201cwith respect to Federal taxes other than ac-\ntions brought under section 7428 of the Internal Reve-\nnue Code of 1986.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2201(a); see ibid. (excluding \ncertain bankruptcy and duty-related proceedings).  Sec-\ntion 7428 grants authority to issue declaratory judgments, \nbut only with respect to tax-exempt status.  26 U.S.C. \n7428(a)(1) and (2).  Congress has also authorized the Tax \nCourt to issue declaratory relief in certain other con-\ntexts.  See 26 U.S.C. 7476-7479.  But none of those pro-\nvisions authorizes the Tax Court to issue declaratory \njudgments in a levy-review proceeding under Section \n6330.   \nRespondent contends (Br. in Opp. 23) that because \nSection 6330(e)(1) \u201cauthorizes\u201d the Tax Court to order \n\u201cinjunctive relief,\u201d it \u201cnecessarily * * *  authorizes de-\nclaratory relief\u200a\u201d as well.  See Pet. App. 35a-36a.  But \nrespondent\u2019s reasoning fails on its own terms.  Where \nthe IRS no longer seeks to enforce a levy, the court has \nno power to enjoin a levy under Section 6330(e).  See, \ne.g., Willson, 805 F.3d at 321.  Respondent therefore \ncannot bootstrap from the Tax Court\u2019s authority to is-\nsue an injunction the \u201cmilder\u201d authority to issue a de-\nclaratory judgment.  Br. in Opp. 23 (quoting Steffel v. \nThompson, 415 U.S. 452, 466-467 (1974)). \nMore generally, Section 6330(e)(1)\u2019s limited grant of \nauthority to enjoin a specific collection action during a \nlevy-review proceeding does not provide for Tax Court \njurisdiction over any administrative action other than \nthe proposed levy that is \u201cthe subject of the requested \nhearing.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(1).  That provision simply \nprovides courts with an enforcement mechanism to pre-\n\n29 \n \nvent the use of a particular administrative collection \ntool\u2014an administrative levy to collect a specific under-\nlying liability\u2014while the taxpayer is provided the op-\nportunity to mount a pre-deprivation challenge to that \nlevy.  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(A) and (e). \nReading the exception in Section 6330(e) to open the \ndoor to more general declaratory and injunctive relief \nwould be at odds with Congress\u2019s determination, as a \ngeneral rule, to \u201cpermit the United States to assess and \ncollect taxes alleged to be due without judicial interven-\ntion, and to require that the legal right to the disputed \nsums be determined in a suit for refund.\u201d  Enochs v. \nWilliams Packing & Navigation Co., 370 U.S. 1, 7 \n(1962) (citing 26 U.S.C. 7421(a)); see, e.g., Phillips v. \nCommissioner, 283 U.S. 589, 595-597 (1931).  Congress\u2019s \ndecision to suspend certain collection procedures while \nlevy-review proceedings are pending\u2014and to authorize \nthe Tax Court to enforce that suspension\u2014did not cre-\nate additional exceptions to the general rule.4 \nc. Respondent suggests that the Tax Court\u2019s limited \npre-deprivation jurisdiction survives the IRS\u2019s aban-\n \n4 The court of appeals declined to decide whether the Tax Court \nhas \u201coverpayment or refund jurisdiction in a context like this,\u201d Pet. \nApp. 34a n.38, and respondent has not raised that issue in this Court, \nsee Br. in Opp. 21.  There is no general grant of refund jurisdiction \nin the Tax Court.  See, e.g., United States ex rel. Girard Trust Co. \nv. Helvering, 301 U.S. 540, 542 (1937) (addressing the Tax Court\u2019s \npredecessor); Empire Ordinance Corp. v. Harrington, 249 F.2d \n680, 682 (D.C. Cir. 1957).  And while Congress has given the Tax \nCourt jurisdiction to determine an overpayment or refund in certain \nspecific proceedings, see 26 U.S.C. 6015(e) and (g), 6213, 6214(a), \n6404(h), 6512(b), it has not done so with respect to pre-levy chal-\nlenges under Section 6330, see, e.g., Brown v. Commissioner, 58 \nF.4th 1064, 1066-1067 (9th Cir. 2023); McLane, 24 F.4th at 319; Will-\nson, 805 F.3d at 321; Greene-Thapedi, 126 T.C. at 8, 12-13. \n\n30 \n \ndonment of its proposed levy because, in other contexts, \n\u201cjurisdiction \u2018depend[s] upon the state of things at the \ntime of the action brought.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Br. in Opp. 16 (quoting \nGrupo Dataflux v. Atlas Global Grp., L.P., 541 U.S. 567, \n570 (2004)).  But as the cases that respondent cites make \nclear, \u201cthat principle is not absolute.\u201d  Coba v. Ford Mo-\ntor Co., 932 F.3d 114, 119 (3d Cir. 2019).  Most \u201cnotably, \nwhere a case becomes moot in the course of the litiga-\ntion,\u201d a court cannot continue to adjudicate it.  Cun-\nningham Charter Corp. v. LearJet, Inc., 592 F.3d 805, \n810 (7th Cir. 2010).  That is the case here:  Section 6330 \nprovides the Tax Court with jurisdiction to review a \n\u201cdetermination\u201d whether a proposed levy may proceed.  \n26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3) and (d)(1).  When there is no longer \nany need for such a determination, there is no need for \nreview of such a determination, and the Section 6330 \nproceeding is moot. \nEven outside of mootness scenarios, this Court has \nrecognized that a court may be deprived of subject- \nmatter jurisdiction by developments that fundamen-\ntally alter the basis for a lawsuit, such as \u201cthe with-\ndrawal of [the original] allegations\u201d on which jurisdic-\ntion was based.  Rockwell Int\u2019l Corp. v. United States, \n549 U.S. 457, 473 (2007).  The Court recently applied \nthat principle in Royal Canin U.S.A., Inc. v. Wull-\nschleger, 604 U.S. 22 (2025).  There, the plaintiff filed a \ncomplaint in state court containing both federal- and \nstate-law claims, and the defendant removed the case to \nfederal court, invoking federal-question jurisdiction \n(over the federal-law claims) and supplemental jurisdic-\ntion (over the state-law claims).  Id. at 28-29.  After the \nremoval, the plaintiff amended her complaint to remove \nthe federal claims.  Id. at 29.  This Court recognized \nthat, at that point, the \u201cchanges in claims\u201d had \u201ceffec-\n\n31 \n \ntively rema[d]e the suit.\u201d   Id. at 35.  Because there were \nno longer any federal-law claims to which the consider-\nation of state-law claims could be considered supple-\nmental, the district court had ceased to have any \u201csup-\nplemental jurisdiction at all.\u201d  Id. at 34. \nThe same logic applies here.  The fundamental basis \nfor a Section 6330 proceeding is the taxpayer\u2019s claim \nthat the IRS should not be allowed to collect a tax lia-\nbility via levy.  See C.A. App. 24 (respondent\u2019s petition \nfor review in the Tax Court sought review of the \u201cdeter-\nmination  * * *  reflected in [the] Notice of Determina-\ntion Concerning Collection Action[s]\u201d in her case, which \n\u201csustained the validity and appropriateness of a Final \nNotice of Intent to Levy\u201d).  Respondent\u2019s overpayments \nof taxes in subsequent years\u2014and the IRS\u2019s resulting \ndetermination that it \u201cno longer needs nor intends to \ncollect [respondent\u2019s] income tax liability\u201d via levy, C.A. \nDoc. 5-4, at 450\u2014effectively remade the suit, eliminat-\ning the need to determine whether the levy could pro-\nceed and hence any need to decide the underlying tax \nliability.  The Tax Court accordingly ceased to have ju-\nrisdiction under Section 6330.   \n2. The Tax Court has no \u201cimplicit\u201d jurisdiction to  \nreview offsets in a Section 6330 proceeding  \nThe court of appeals alternatively held that this case \nis not moot because the Tax Court could review the \nIRS\u2019s allocation of respondent\u2019s later-year overpay-\nments to offset her 2010 tax liability.  Pet. App. 20a-25a.  \nIn so holding, the court of appeals reasoned that, while \n\u201cit may be that Congress has not explicitly granted the \nTax Court such power,\u201d there is nevertheless \u201can im-\nplicit grant\u201d of jurisdiction that \u201callows the [Tax] Court \nto review setoffs in any event.\u201d  Id. at 20a. \n\n32 \n \nRespondent did not defend that aspect of the court \nof appeals\u2019 decision in her brief in opposition.  And for \ngood reason.  Tax Court jurisdiction must be expressly \nconferred by statute.  See p. 16, supra; 26 U.S.C. 7442 \n(\u201cThe Tax Court and its divisions shall have such juris-\ndiction as is conferred on them by this title, by chapters \n1, 2, 3, and 4 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, by \ntitle II and title III of the Revenue Act of 1926 (44 Stat. \n10\u201387), or by laws enacted subsequent to February 26, \n1926.\u201d).  And no statute grants the Tax Court jurisdic-\ntion to review in a Section 6330 proceeding the IRS\u2019s \nexercise of authority under Section 6402(a) to credit (or \noffset) a taxpayer\u2019s overpayments against her tax liabil-\nity.  To the contrary, Section 6330 grants the Tax Court \njurisdiction only to review\u2014and, if necessary, enjoin\u2014\nthe \u201clevy action[]\u201d that is the \u201csubject of the requested \nhearing.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(1).  It does not affect the \nIRS\u2019s ability to take other enforcement actions, includ-\ning the authority to credit overpayments against exist-\ning liabilities under Section 6402; nor does it grant the \nTax Court jurisdiction to review such actions.  See 26 \nC.F.R. 301.6330\u20131(g)(2), Q & A-G3; see also Belloff v. \nCommissioner, 996 F.2d 607, 616 (2d Cir. 1993).  Courts \nhave therefore repeatedly held that the Tax Court lacks \njurisdiction to review Section 6402(a) credits in a Sec-\ntion 6330 proceeding.  See, e.g., Boyd v. Commissioner, \n451 F.3d 8, 10-11 (1st Cir. 2006); Greene-Thapedi, 126 \nT.C. at 7-8.   \nMoreover, even if the Tax Court had jurisdiction to \nreview the application of credits under Section 6402 in \na Section 6330 proceeding, the court of appeals\u2019 moot-\nness holding would still be erroneous.  The court of ap-\npeals reasoned that the Tax Court has jurisdiction to \nreview the IRS\u2019s use of respondent\u2019s overpayments to \n\n33 \n \noffset her tax liability, and that those offsets were inva-\nlid, such that respondent should be deemed to have an \noutstanding tax liability for 2010.  Pet. App. 20a-25a.  \nAnd the court of appeals took the view that the Tax \nCourt therefore has jurisdiction to consider respond-\nent\u2019s challenge to \u201cthe IRS\u2019s application of the esti-\nmated payments\u201d to Gennardo rather than respondent.  \nPet. App. 19a.  But the Tax Court would have jurisdic-\ntion under Section 6330 to consider such a challenge \nonly in connection with a live dispute over a proposed \nlevy.  See pp. 16-31, supra.  And the IRS has no basis \nfor pursuing a levy so long as respondent\u2019s overpay-\nments remain \u201cin the government\u2019s pocket.\u201d  Pet. App. \n25a.  Nor did the court of appeals conclude that the Tax \nCourt could order the IRS to refund those overpay-\nments.  See p. 29 n.4, supra.  Thus, even if the applica-\ntion of credits was invalid\u2014and it was not5\u2014the Section \n6330 proceeding would still be moot at this point.  \nD. The Instant Case Is Moot \nApplying the foregoing principles, respondent\u2019s case \nis moot.  In 2012, respondent self-reported to the IRS \nthat she owed $21,918 in taxes for tax year 2010.  C.A. \nApp. 475.  The IRS assessed liability based on respond-\nent\u2019s representation.  Id. at 280; see 26 U.S.C. 6201(a)(1).  \nWhen the IRS then proposed to collect the liability by \n \n5 The court of appeals concluded that the application of credits vi-\nolated the common-law rule that \u201ca creditor cannot set off a disputed \ndebt with an undisputed one.\u201d  Pet. App. 22a.  But that rule has no \napplication under Section 6402(a), which authorizes the IRS to \n\u201ccredit the amount of [an] overpayment  * * *  against any liability,\u201d \nundisputed or not.  26 U.S.C. 6402(a).  The court also reasoned that \nthe application of credits violated \u201cArticle III mootness principles.\u201d  \nPet. App. 25a.  But no such principles limit the IRS\u2019s exercise of \nstatutory authority under Section 6402(a). \n\n34 \n \nadministrative levy, respondent timely requested a pre-\ndeprivation hearing under Section 6330 to argue that \ncertain estimated tax payments should be applied to her \naccount, which would have (more than) satisfied her re-\nported tax liability, such that the proposed levy could \nnot go forward.  C.A. App. 566.   \nDuring the pendency of her pre-levy proceedings, re-\nspondent made overpayments for subsequent tax years, \nand, under Section 6402(a), the IRS credited those new \npayments against respondent\u2019s 2010 liability.  With no \nunpaid tax remaining on respondent\u2019s underlying liabil-\nity, there is no basis to proceed with the levy that re-\nspondent had challenged.  In these circumstances, there \nis no live dispute subject to Section 6330, and the Tax \nCourt can grant no further relief in a Section 6330 pro-\nceeding.  The case is therefore moot.   \nContrary to respondent\u2019s suggestion, that result \ndoes not violate \u201cthe presumption favoring judicial re-\nview of administrative action.\u201d  Br. in Opp. 23 (citation \nomitted).  As respondent has acknowledged (id. at 2, 4, \n13, 16, 25), a holding that her Section 6330 proceeding \nis moot will not foreclose her from seeking judicial re-\nview because she could file a refund suit\u2014the tradi-\ntional mechanism for disputing the assessment or col-\nlection of a federal tax, and the one that is available re-\ngardless of whether the IRS had ever proposed to levy \non respondent\u2019s property.  See 26 U.S.C. 7422(a); 28 \nU.S.C. 1346(a)(1); see also 26 U.S.C. 7422(d) (deeming \noverpayment credits to be \u201cpayment[s]\u201d for purposes of \na refund suit).  This Court should hew to Section 6330\u2019s \nplain text, which limits the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to a \ndispute over a proposed levy. \n\n35 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThis Court should reverse the judgment of the court \nof appeals. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nSARAH M.

This brief will detail the legal and policy reasons why the case is not moot, directly rebut the petitioner's claims, and present the respondent's interpretation of the relevant statutes (like 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6330) and precedent. The information gain for the specific task is therefore extremely high, as it provides the other half of the core legal dispute. The design EIG is moderate; while retrieving the opposing party's brief is a fundamental and expected step in legal analysis, its execution reinforces the core strategy of systematically gathering arguments from all parties before attempting a synthesis or prediction.

See I.R.C. \u00a7 6330. At the hearing, the \ntaxpayer may raise \u201cany relevant issue relating to the \nunpaid \ntax \nor \nthe \nproposed \nlevy.\u201d \nI.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A). The taxpayer may also challenge her \nunderlying tax liability if she did not previously have \nan opportunity to do so. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B). The Ap-\npeals Office issues a \u201cdetermination,\u201d which \u201cshall \ntake into consideration\u201d \u201cthe issues raised under par-\nagraph (2),\u201d including any challenge relating to the \nunpaid tax or the taxpayer\u2019s liability. I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(c)(3). After the Appeals Office renders its de-\ntermination, the taxpayer may \u201cpetition the Tax Court \nfor review of such determination,\u201d \u201cand the Tax Court \nshall have jurisdiction with respect to such matter.\u201d \nI.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). \nThe question presented is whether the Tax Court \nretains jurisdiction under I.R.C. \u00a7 6330 to review the \nAppeals Office\u2019s determination of the taxpayer\u2019s un-\npaid tax or underlying liability when, despite the \nparties\u2019 live dispute about that issue, the IRS stops \npursuing the levy, because it instead keeps the tax-\npayer\u2019s overpayments for later tax years. \n \n \n\nii \n \n \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDINGS AND \nRELATED PROCEEDINGS \nPetitioner\u2019s lists of the parties to the proceeding \nand directly related proceedings are complete and cor-\nrect. \n\niii \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \nQUESTION PRESENTED ........................................... i \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDINGS AND \nRELATED PROCEEDINGS ................................ ii \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES ....................................... vi \nINTRODUCTION ........................................................ 1 \nSTATEMENT .............................................................. 6 \nA. Legal background ........................................... 6 \nB. Factual and procedural background ............ 10 \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT ................................... 16 \nARGUMENT.............................................................. 21 \nI. \nThe Tax Court had jurisdiction under I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330 to review and rule on Zuch\u2019s unpaid \ntax or tax liability, so the case isn\u2019t moot. ......... 21 \nA. The Tax Court had jurisdiction to \nreview the Appeals Office\u2019s \ndetermination of Zuch\u2019s entitlement to \nthe estimated payments. .............................. 21 \n1. Section 6330\u2019s plain text states that \nthe Tax Court has jurisdiction to \nreview the Appeals Office\u2019s \n\u201cdetermination\u201d of a taxpayer\u2019s \nchallenge to \u201cany relevant issue \nrelating to [her] unpaid tax\u201d or her \n\u201cunderlying liability.\u201d ............................. 21 \n2. Statutory context confirms that \nCongress gave the Tax Court \ncontinuing jurisdiction to resolve \nissues relating to the unpaid tax \nand tax liability disputes. ...................... 24 \n\niv \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \n(continued) \nPage \n \n \n3. The Tax Court had jurisdiction \nunder \u00a7 6330 to review the Appeals \nOffice\u2019s determination, including its \nresolution of Zuch\u2019s entitlement to \nthe estimated payments......................... 26 \nB. Zuch\u2019s case did not become moot when \nthe IRS decided to stop pursuing the \nlevy, because the parties disputed, and \nthe Tax Court had the power to \nadjudicate, Zuch\u2019s entitlement to the \nestimated payments. .................................... 27 \n1. A case becomes moot only when the \nparties no longer have a concrete \ninterest in the outcome of the \nlitigation and judicial relief is not \nlikely to redress any injury. ................... 28 \n2. Zuch\u2019s challenge isn\u2019t moot because \na favorable Tax Court ruling on \nunderlying liability or unpaid tax \nwould likely redress her pocketbook \ninjury. ..................................................... 28 \nII. The IRS\u2019s counterarguments lack merit. ........... 31 \nA. The Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to review \nwhether Zuch was entitled to the \nprepayments didn\u2019t dissolve once the \nIRS no longer needed the levy. .................... 31 \n1. There is no textual basis in \u00a7 6330 \nfor the government\u2019s continuing-\nlevy requirement. ................................... 32 \n\nv \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \n(continued) \nPage \n \n \n2. The government misconstrues \n\u00a7 6330\u2019s history and downplays its \nremedial purpose, which both \nsupport the Tax Court\u2019s \u00a7 6330 \njurisdiction to review unpaid tax \nand liability disputes even if the \nIRS no longer pursues the levy. ............. 36 \n3. Royal Canin doesn\u2019t help the \ngovernment. ............................................ 37 \n4. The government\u2019s policy argument \nis meritless. ............................................ 39 \nB. The Tax Court\u2019s authority is not limited \nto approving or rejecting a proposed \nlevy, but includes the power to issue \nbinding judgments. ....................................... 40 \nC. The government\u2019s claim that the parties \nlack a legally cognizable interest in the \ncase once the IRS decides not to move \nforward with the levy is incorrect. ............... 42 \nD. Whether Zuch\u2019s challenge is a dispute \nabout an unpaid tax or underlying \nliability is immaterial. .................................. 43 \nCONCLUSION .......................................................... 44 \n \n \n \n\nvi \n \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES \nPage(s) \nCASES \nB&B Hardware, Inc. v.

The answer is yes. The Tax Court has juris-\ndiction under Internal Revenue Code \u00a7 6330(d)(1) to \nreview the Appeals Office\u2019s determination and the \nmatters and issues that determination resolves, and \nnothing in \u00a7 6330 conditions that jurisdiction on the \nIRS\u2019s continuing pursuit of a levy. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1); \nsee I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c). The Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to re-\nview the Appeals Office\u2019s determination thus gives the \ncourt authority to rule on the taxpayer\u2019s unpaid tax or \nunderlying liability. And because the government is \nexpected to abide by judicial rulings, those rulings \nwould redress Zuch\u2019s pocketbook injury. This case is \nnot moot. \nJennifer Zuch owed about $27,000 for the 2010 tax \nyear. But she and her ex-husband had already made \n$50,000 in estimated payments to the IRS for the 2010 \ntax year, and Zuch asked the IRS to apply those pay-\nments to her tax bill. Zuch\u2019s ex-husband agreed that \nthose tax payments should be applied to Zuch\u2019s tax \nbill. But the IRS refused. Instead, it applied the full \n$50,000 in estimated payments to Zuch\u2019s ex-husband\u2019s \nbalance. It then threatened to seize Zuch\u2019s property to \ncollect her 2010 tax assessment. \nZuch exercised her right to a hearing under \n\u00a7 6330, which provides taxpayers with procedural pro-\ntections before the IRS may levy their property to \ncollect taxes. Congress enacted \u00a7 6330 as part of the \nInternal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform \n\n2 \n \n \nAct in response to abusive IRS collections practices \nthat forced some taxpayers to spend their life\u2019s sav-\nings on taxes the IRS or courts later determined they \nnever even owed. Practices & Procedures of the Inter-\nnal Revenue Service: Hearings Before the Committee \non Finance, 105th Cong., S. Hrg. 105-190 at 75-82 \n(1997) [hereinafter Hearings Before the Committee on \nFinance] (statement of Katherine Lund Hicks). Sec-\ntion 6330 ensures that taxpayers can dispute their tax \nbill before having to pay. The provision allows taxpay-\ners threatened with a levy to initiate administrative \nhearings before the Appeals Office and to raise \u201cany \nrelevant issue relating to the unpaid tax\u201d or challenge \ntheir liability if they haven\u2019t yet had a chance to do so. \nI.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2). Section 6330 also grants taxpayers \nan opportunity for meaningful judicial review by \ngranting the Tax Court jurisdiction to review the Ap-\npeals Office\u2019s determination. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). \nAt her administrative hearing, Zuch argued that \nthe IRS should have credited her with the $50,000 in \nestimated payments that she and her ex-husband had \nmade. Those payments would have covered her 2010 \ntax bill and entitled her to a refund. The Appeals Of-\nfice disagreed, concluding that Zuch was not entitled \nto any portion of the estimated payments and uphold-\ning the proposed levy. Zuch petitioned the Tax Court \nfor review of the Appeals Office\u2019s determination. But \nduring the course of the Tax Court proceedings, the \nIRS kept overpayments that Zuch made for later tax \nyears and used them to offset her disputed 2010 lia-\nbility. By 2019, after six years of litigation, the IRS \nclaimed that Zuch had satisfied the disputed liability, \nand it moved to dismiss the Tax Court proceedings as \nmoot. \n\n3 \n \n \nThe Tax Court agreed and dismissed the petition. \nAccording to the court, because there was no unpaid \nliability and no levy, the case was moot. Pet. App. 43a. \nThe court of appeals vacated and remanded. In a \npart of the opinion joined by two panel members, the \ncourt held that the case was not moot because the Tax \nCourt had jurisdiction to review the Appeals Office\u2019s \ndetermination of and declare Zuch\u2019s liability. Pet. \nApp. 25a-26a; see Pet. App. 25a-38a. And a declara-\ntory judgment, the court concluded, would redress \nZuch\u2019s injury. Pet. App. 37a-38a. \nThe court of appeals correctly recognized that the \nTax Court had jurisdiction to review the Appeals Of-\nfice\u2019s determination and that this case is not moot. \nThis Court should affirm. \n1. a. The Tax Court had, and retained, jurisdic-\ntion to review the Appeals Office\u2019s determination. \nSection 6330\u2019s plain text states that the Tax Court \n\u201cshall have jurisdiction\u201d to \u201creview\u201d the Appeals Of-\nfice\u2019s \u201cdetermination,\u201d including its resolution of \u201cany \nrelevant issue relating to the unpaid tax,\u201d or the tax-\npayer\u2019s \u201cunderlying tax liability.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2), \n(c)(3), (d)(1). Nothing in that language, or anything \nelse in \u00a7 6330, requires an ongoing attempt to levy the \ntaxpayer\u2019s property. Thus, the Tax Court retains ju-\nrisdiction \nto \nreview \nthe \nAppeals \nOffice\u2019s \ndetermination, even if the IRS stops pursuing a levy, \nso long as the taxpayer continues to dispute her un-\npaid tax or underlying liability. That makes sense, \ngiven that the whole point of \u00a7 6330 is to make sure \nthat levy proceedings are fair and that a taxpayer can \nchallenge her liability if she had no prior opportunity \nto do so. Indeed, the very design of \u00a7 6330 seeks to en-\nsure that the government is \u201cturn[ing] square corners \n\n4 \n \n \nin dealing with the people,\u201d Department of Homeland \nSecurity v. Regents of the University of California, 591 \nU.S. 1, 24 (2020).  \nb. This case is not moot. The Tax Court had au-\nthority to determine Zuch\u2019s entitlement to the \nprepayments. See I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). A case is moot \nonly when the parties no longer retain any interest in \nthe outcome of the proceedings. But here, both parties \nhave a concrete interest in the outcome of the litiga-\ntion: If Zuch wins, the IRS will likely refund her \nmoney. If the IRS wins, it will keep her money. Either \nway, the Tax Court\u2019s ruling will be preclusive in a re-\nfund suit\u2014which the government has invited Zuch to \nfile\u2014so the stakes are real. And Zuch has now filed a \nrefund suit in the District of New Jersey seeking to \nrecover some of her overpayments. \n2. The IRS\u2019s counterarguments are meritless. \nThe IRS claims that the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to re-\nview the Appeals Office\u2019s determination vanished, and \nthat the case is moot, because the IRS decided it no \nlonger needed a levy after it took Zuch\u2019s money an-\nother way. The government\u2019s arguments fail.  \nFirst, the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to review \nwhether Zuch was entitled to the prepayments didn\u2019t \ndisappear once the IRS stopped pursuing the levy. \nPlain text makes that clear. Although the term \u201clevy\u201d \nappears throughout \u00a7 6330, the provision that grants \nthe Tax Court jurisdiction over the Appeals Office\u2019s \ndetermination\u2014\u00a7 6330(d)(1)\u2014doesn\u2019t condition juris-\ndiction on a levy. History and purpose don\u2019t help the \ngovernment, either. Congress enacted \u00a7 6330 to rem-\nedy IRS abuses and give taxpayers a fair shot at \ndisputing what they owe before collection, underscor-\ning why Congress likely wanted the Tax Court to \n\n5 \n \n \nretain jurisdiction to resolve disputes over unpaid tax \nand liability. Section 6330 must be construed in light \nof that remedial purpose.  \nInvoking Royal Canin U.S.A., Inc. v. Wullschleger, \n604 U.S. 22 (2025), the government claims that the \nTax Court lost jurisdiction because the IRS fundamen-\ntally altered the basis of the suit when it decided not \nto seek the levy. But again, \u00a7 6330 gave the Tax Court \njurisdiction to review an Appeals Office determination \nand nothing in the provision requires a levy. See I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1). Put differently, \u00a7 6330(d) gives the Tax \nCourt jurisdiction so long as the taxpayer challenges \nan Appeals Office determination. The Court recently \nmade clear in the \u00a7 6330 context that a procedural re-\nquirement is jurisdictional only if Congress \u201cclearly \nstates\u201d that it is. Boechler, P.C. v. Commissioner, 596 \nU.S. 199, 203 (2022). But the word \u201clevy\u201d doesn\u2019t even \nappear in \u00a7 6330(d). In any event, even if \u00a7 6330 re-\nquired a levy, the requirement would look to the time \nof filing, and there was a proposed levy when Zuch pe-\ntitioned the Tax Court.  \nAppealing to policy, the government says that if \nthe Tax Court has jurisdiction to review liability dis-\nputes like Zuch\u2019s, the Tax Court will become a forum \nfor general liability claims. For starters, the govern-\nment hasn\u2019t pointed to any cases showing that \ntaxpayers are invoking \u00a7 6330 to bring general liabil-\nity challenges. Plus, to invoke the Tax Court\u2019s \u00a7 6330 \njurisdiction, a taxpayer needs an Appeals Office deter-\nmination. The Tax Court can address unpaid tax or \nliability issues only if the Appeals Office\u2019s determina-\ntion resolved them. What\u2019s more, the question \npresented in this case rarely arises, and when it does, \nit\u2019s only because the IRS starts levy proceedings, gets \nthe taxpayer\u2019s money another way, and once the Tax \n\n6 \n \n \nCourt is reviewing the determination, decides to aban-\ndon the levy midstream. The IRS can easily avoid its \nself-made problem.  \nSecond, the government asserts that the Tax \nCourt lacks authority to declare Zuch\u2019s entitlement to \nthe prepayments because the Declaratory Judgment \nAct (DJA) and Anti-Injunction Act (AIA) generally \nprohibit courts from issuing declaratory and injunc-\ntive relief in federal tax cases. That argument fails. \nSection 6330(d)(1) authorizes the Tax Court to deter-\nmine the taxpayer\u2019s unpaid tax and underlying \nliability in \u00a7 6330 proceedings. And \u00a7 6330(e)(1) con-\nfirms that the Tax Court can issue declaratory relief, \nexempting \u00a7 6330 proceedings from the DJA\u2019s and \nAIA\u2019s prohibitions on declaratory and injunctive relief \nin other tax cases.  \nFinally, the government claims it mooted the case \nby abandoning the levy because the levy gave rise to \nthe proceeding. But that\u2019s not how moot\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

See I.R.C. \u00a7 6330. At the hearing, the \ntaxpayer may raise \u201cany relevant issue relating to the \nunpaid \ntax \nor \nthe \nproposed \nlevy.\u201d \nI.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A). The taxpayer may also challenge her \nunderlying tax liability if she did not previously have \nan opportunity to do so. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B).

The answer is yes. The Tax Court has juris-\ndiction under Internal Revenue Code \u00a7 6330(d)(1) to \nreview the Appeals Office\u2019s determination and the \nmatters and issues that determination resolves, and \nnothing in \u00a7 6330 conditions that jurisdiction on the \nIRS\u2019s continuing pursuit of a levy. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1); \nsee I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c). The Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to re-\nview the Appeals Office\u2019s determination thus gives the \ncourt authority to rule on the taxpayer\u2019s unpaid tax or \nunderlying liability. And because the government is \nexpected to abide by judicial rulings, those rulings \nwould redress Zuch\u2019s pocketbook injury. This case is \nnot moot. \nJennifer Zuch owed about $27,000 for the 2010 tax \nyear. But she and her ex-husband had already made \n$50,000 in estimated payments to the IRS for the 2010 \ntax year, and Zuch asked the IRS to apply those pay-\nments to her tax bill. Zuch\u2019s ex-husband agreed that \nthose tax payments should be applied to Zuch\u2019s tax \nbill. But the IRS refused. Instead, it applied the full \n$50,000 in estimated payments to Zuch\u2019s ex-husband\u2019s \nbalance. It then threatened to seize Zuch\u2019s property to \ncollect her 2010 tax assessment. \nZuch exercised her right to a hearing under \n\u00a7 6330, which provides taxpayers with procedural pro-\ntections before the IRS may levy their property to \ncollect taxes. Congress enacted \u00a7 6330 as part of the \nInternal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform \n\n2 \n \n \nAct in response to abusive IRS collections practices \nthat forced some taxpayers to spend their life\u2019s sav-\nings on taxes the IRS or courts later determined they \nnever even owed. Practices & Procedures of the Inter-\nnal Revenue Service: Hearings Before the Committee \non Finance, 105th Cong., S. Hrg. 105-190 at 75-82 \n(1997) [hereinafter Hearings Before the Committee on \nFinance] (statement of Katherine Lund Hicks). Sec-\ntion 6330 ensures that taxpayers can dispute their tax \nbill before having to pay. The provision allows taxpay-\ners threatened with a levy to initiate administrative \nhearings before the Appeals Office and to raise \u201cany \nrelevant issue relating to the unpaid tax\u201d or challenge \ntheir liability if they haven\u2019t yet had a chance to do so. \nI.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2). Section 6330 also grants taxpayers \nan opportunity for meaningful judicial review by \ngranting the Tax Court jurisdiction to review the Ap-\npeals Office\u2019s determination. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). \nAt her administrative hearing, Zuch argued that \nthe IRS should have credited her with the $50,000 in \nestimated payments that she and her ex-husband had \nmade. Those payments would have covered her 2010 \ntax bill and entitled her to a refund. The Appeals Of-\nfice disagreed, concluding that Zuch was not entitled \nto any portion of the estimated payments and uphold-\ning the proposed levy. Zuch petitioned the Tax Court \nfor review of the Appeals Office\u2019s determination. But \nduring the course of the Tax Court proceedings, the \nIRS kept overpayments that Zuch made for later tax \nyears and used them to offset her disputed 2010 lia-\nbility. By 2019, after six years of litigation, the IRS \nclaimed that Zuch had satisfied the disputed liability, \nand it moved to dismiss the Tax Court proceedings as \nmoot. \n\n3 \n \n \nThe Tax Court agreed and dismissed the petition. \nAccording to the court, because there was no unpaid \nliability and no levy, the case was moot. Pet. App. 43a. \nThe court of appeals vacated and remanded. In a \npart of the opinion joined by two panel members, the \ncourt held that the case was not moot because the Tax \nCourt had jurisdiction to review the Appeals Office\u2019s \ndetermination of and declare Zuch\u2019s liability. Pet. \nApp. 25a-26a; see Pet. App. 25a-38a. And a declara-\ntory judgment, the court concluded, would redress \nZuch\u2019s injury. Pet. App. 37a-38a. \nThe court of appeals correctly recognized that the \nTax Court had jurisdiction to review the Appeals Of-\nfice\u2019s determination and that this case is not moot. \nThis Court should affirm. \n1. a. The Tax Court had, and retained, jurisdic-\ntion to review the Appeals Office\u2019s determination. \nSection 6330\u2019s plain text states that the Tax Court \n\u201cshall have jurisdiction\u201d to \u201creview\u201d the Appeals Of-\nfice\u2019s \u201cdetermination,\u201d including its resolution of \u201cany \nrelevant issue relating to the unpaid tax,\u201d or the tax-\npayer\u2019s \u201cunderlying tax liability.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2), \n(c)(3), (d)(1). Nothing in that language, or anything \nelse in \u00a7 6330, requires an ongoing attempt to levy the \ntaxpayer\u2019s property. Thus, the Tax Court retains ju-\nrisdiction \nto \nreview \nthe \nAppeals \nOffice\u2019s \ndetermination, even if the IRS stops pursuing a levy, \nso long as the taxpayer continues to dispute her un-\npaid tax or underlying liability. That makes sense, \ngiven that the whole point of \u00a7 6330 is to make sure \nthat levy proceedings are fair and that a taxpayer can \nchallenge her liability if she had no prior opportunity \nto do so. Indeed, the very design of \u00a7 6330 seeks to en-\nsure that the government is \u201cturn[ing] square corners \n\n4 \n \n \nin dealing with the people,\u201d Department of Homeland \nSecurity v. Regents of the University of California, 591 \nU.S. 1, 24 (2020).  \nb. This case is not moot. The Tax Court had au-\nthority to determine Zuch\u2019s entitlement to the \nprepayments. See I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). A case is moot \nonly when the parties no longer retain any interest in \nthe outcome of the proceedings. But here, both parties \nhave a concrete interest in the outcome of the litiga-\ntion: If Zuch wins, the IRS will likely refund her \nmoney. If the IRS wins, it will keep her money. Either \nway, the Tax Court\u2019s ruling will be preclusive in a re-\nfund suit\u2014which the government has invited Zuch to \nfile\u2014so the stakes are real. And Zuch has now filed a \nrefund suit in the District of New Jersey seeking to \nrecover some of her overpayments. \n2. The IRS\u2019s counterarguments are meritless. \nThe IRS claims that the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to re-\nview the Appeals Office\u2019s determination vanished, and \nthat the case is moot, because the IRS decided it no \nlonger needed a levy after it took Zuch\u2019s money an-\nother way. The government\u2019s arguments fail.  \nFirst, the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to review \nwhether Zuch was entitled to the prepayments didn\u2019t \ndisappear once the IRS stopped pursuing the levy. \nPlain text makes that clear. Although the term \u201clevy\u201d \nappears throughout \u00a7 6330, the provision that grants \nthe Tax Court jurisdiction over the Appeals Office\u2019s \ndetermination\u2014\u00a7 6330(d)(1)\u2014doesn\u2019t condition juris-\ndiction on a levy. History and purpose don\u2019t help the \ngovernment, either. Congress enacted \u00a7 6330 to rem-\nedy IRS abuses and give taxpayers a fair shot at \ndisputing what they owe before collection, underscor-\ning why Congress likely wanted the Tax Court to \n\n5 \n \n \nretain jurisdiction to resolve disputes over unpaid tax \nand liability. Section 6330 must be construed in light \nof that remedial purpose.  \nInvoking Royal Canin U.S.A., Inc. v. Wullschleger, \n604 U.S. 22 (2025), the government claims that the \nTax Court lost jurisdiction because the IRS fundamen-\ntally altered the basis of the suit when it decided not \nto seek the levy. But again, \u00a7 6330 gave the Tax Court \njurisdiction to review an Appeals Office determination \nand nothing in the provision requires a levy. See I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1). Put differently, \u00a7 6330(d) gives the Tax \nCourt jurisdiction so long as the taxpayer challenges \nan Appeals Office determination. The Court recently \nmade clear in the \u00a7 6330 context that a procedural re-\nquirement is jurisdictional only if Congress \u201cclearly \nstates\u201d that it is. Boechler, P.C. v. Commissioner, 596 \nU.S. 199, 203 (2022). But the word \u201clevy\u201d doesn\u2019t even \nappear in \u00a7 6330(d). In any event, even if \u00a7 6330 re-\nquired a levy, the requirement would look to the time \nof filing, and there was a proposed levy when Zuch pe-\ntitioned the Tax Court.  \nAppealing to policy, the government says that if \nthe Tax Court has jurisdiction to review liability dis-\nputes like Zuch\u2019s, the Tax Court will become a forum \nfor general liability claims. For starters, the govern-\nment hasn\u2019t pointed to any cases showing that \ntaxpayers are invoking \u00a7 6330 to bring general liabil-\nity challenges. Plus, to invoke the Tax Court\u2019s \u00a7 6330 \njurisdiction, a taxpayer needs an Appeals Office deter-\nmination. The Tax Court can address unpaid tax or \nliability issues only if the Appeals Office\u2019s determina-\ntion resolved them. What\u2019s more, the question \npresented in this case rarely arises, and when it does, \nit\u2019s only because the IRS starts levy proceedings, gets \nthe taxpayer\u2019s money another way, and once the Tax \n\n6 \n \n \nCourt is reviewing the determination, decides to aban-\ndon the levy midstream. The IRS can easily avoid its \nself-made problem.  \nSecond, the government asserts that the Tax \nCourt lacks authority to declare Zuch\u2019s entitlement to \nthe prepayments because the Declaratory Judgment \nAct (DJA) and Anti-Injunction Act (AIA) generally \nprohibit courts from issuing declaratory and injunc-\ntive relief in federal tax cases. That argument fails. \nSection 6330(d)(1) authorizes the Tax Court to deter-\nmine the taxpayer\u2019s unpaid tax and underlying \nliability in \u00a7 6330 proceedings. And \u00a7 6330(e)(1) con-\nfirms that the Tax Court can issue declaratory relief, \nexempting \u00a7 6330 proceedings from the DJA\u2019s and \nAIA\u2019s prohibitions on declaratory and injunctive relief \nin other tax cases.  \nFinally, the government claims it mooted the case \nby abandoning the levy because the levy gave rise to \nthe proceeding. But that\u2019s not how mootness works. \nThe question is whether the parties retain any inter-\nest in the outcome of the litigation. And here, both \nZuch and the IRS have a concrete interest in whether \nand how the Tax Court adjudicates Zuch\u2019s entitlement \nto the estimated payments. \nThe Court should affirm the court of appeals\u2019 de-\ncision and remand so the Tax Court can consider \nZuch\u2019s merits arguments. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal background \n1. Taxpayers often have various ways to dispute \nthe amount of income taxes and other taxes the IRS \nclaims they owe. If the IRS determines that a taxpayer \nowes more taxes than she reported on her tax return, \n\n7 \n \n \nthe IRS typically sends her a notice of deficiency. \nI.R.C. \u00a7 6212(a). Within 90 days, the taxpayer may \nchallenge the claimed deficiency in Tax Court. I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6213(a). In the deficiency proceeding, the Tax Court \ncan determine the correct amount of tax owed and \nwhether the taxpayer made overpayments, entitling \nthe taxpayer to a refund or credit. I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6214(a), \n6512(b)(1). The Tax Court\u2019s final decision is reviewa-\nble by a court of appeals. I.R.C. \u00a7 7482(a)(1). If the \ntaxpayer does not challenge the deficiency, she can \npay the disputed amount and seek a refund in district \ncourt or the Court of Federal Claims. 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1346(a)(1); see I.R.C. \u00a7 7422(a).  \n2. This case centers on a third way a taxpayer \ncan challenge the taxes the IRS assesses when the \ntaxpayer has not paid the taxes the IRS claims she \nowes and the IRS seeks to collect by levying the tax-\npayer\u2019s property. Sometimes, a tax remains unpaid \neven after a taxpayer receives a notice of deficiency. \nOr perhaps a taxpayer hasn\u2019t paid the amount the IRS \nclaims she owes, but she didn\u2019t receive a notice of de-\nficiency or otherwise have an opportunity to dispute \nher liability. In either situation, the IRS may decide \nto pursue a levy on the taxpayer\u2019s property. I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6331(a), (b). \nIf the IRS issues a levy notice, the taxpayer has 30 \ndays to request an administrative hearing before the \nAppeals Office under I.R.C. \u00a7 6330, sometimes called \na \u201ccollection due process\u201d hearing, to challenge the \nproposed levy and her underlying tax liability. I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(b), (c)(2)(B); see Boechler, 596 U.S. at 202; \nByers v. Commissioner, 740 F.3d 668, 671-72 (D.C. \nCir. 2014). This case involves a \u00a7 6330 proceeding in \nwhich the parties dispute the taxpayer\u2019s liability and \nunpaid tax.  \n\n8 \n \n \na. The issues a taxpayer may raise in a collection \ndue process hearing depend in part on whether the \ntaxpayer received a notice of deficiency or had another \nopportunity to dispute her liability. If she did not, she \nmay raise \u201cchallenges to the existence or amount\u201d of \nher liability. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B). A collection due \nprocess hearing thus serves as a backstop, ensuring \nthat a taxpayer has an opportunity to dispute her un-\nderlying tax liability because she was not able to do so \nearlier. Liability challenges aside, all taxpayers in col-\nlection due process proceedings may raise \u201cany \nrelevant issue relating to the unpaid tax or the pro-\nposed levy, including\u201d \u201cappropriate spousal defenses,\u201d \n\u201cchallenges to the appropriateness of collection ac-\ntions,\u201d and \u201coffers of collection alternatives,\u201d no \nmatter whether they had an earlier opportunity to dis-\npute their liability. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A). The Appeals \nOffice then makes a \u201cdetermination\u201d that \u201cshall take \ninto consideration\u201d the taxpayer\u2019s challenge to the un-\npaid tax, her underlying liability, and any other issues \nraised. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(3). \nAlthough it is an important backstop, a collection \ndue process hearing \u201clacks the typical hallmarks of a \njudicial hearing\u201d and is \u201cfar from \u2026 a formal hearing.\u201d \nFarhy v. Commissioner, 100 F.4th 223, 227 (D.C. Cir. \n2024). \u201cThere are no formal discovery procedures, and \nthe taxpayer has no right to subpoena documents or \nwitnesses.\u201d Id. Rather, the hearing \u201cprovides the tax-\npayer \u2018an opportunity for an informal oral or written \nconversation with the IRS.\u2019\u201d Id. \nAfter the Appeals Office issues its \u201cdetermina-\ntion,\u201d the taxpayer may \u201cpetition the Tax Court for \nreview of such determination (and the Tax Court shall \nhave jurisdiction with respect to such matter).\u201d I.R.C. \n\n9 \n \n \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1). The Tax Court\u2019s final judgment is subject \nto review in a court of appeals. I.R.C. \u00a7 7482(a)(1). \nb. Congress enacted \u00a7 6330 in 1998 to protect \ntaxpayers from the IRS\u2019s abusive tax collection prac-\ntices. E.g., 144 Cong. Rec. S4027-32 (daily ed. May 1, \n1998). Leading up to \u00a7 6330\u2019s enactment, Congress \nheld a series of hearings that shed light on those prac-\ntices. For example, taxpayers couldn\u2019t contest a levy \nbefore the IRS seized their property. See Phillips v. \nCommissioner, 283 U.S. 589, 595-96 (1931). And tax-\npayers were often forced to drain their life\u2019s savings\u2014\nand their family\u2019s\u2014to pay assessments they never \neven owed. Hearings Before the Committee on Finance \nat 75-82 (statement of Katherine Lund Hicks). After \nthe hearings, \u201c[m]any people were shocked to learn \nthat a number of the due-process protections Ameri-\ncans take for granted in other legal proceedings do not \napply to actions involving the IRS.\u201d 144 Cong. Rec. \nS4031 (statement of Sen. Enzi). As one member put it, \n\u201cthe problem is, [the IRS] ha[s] too much power, they \nhave no checks and balances.\u201d Hearings Before the \nCommittee on Finance at 56 (statement of Sen. \nGramm). \nIn designing \u00a7 6330, Congress sought to \u201censure \nthat all taxpayers have due process and that the IRS \ndoes not abusively use its liens-and-seizure author-\nity.\u201d 143 Cong. Rec. S12231 (daily ed. Nov. 9, 1997) \n(statement of Sen. Roth). Indeed, the point of \u00a7 6330 \nproceedings is to \u201cincrease fairness to taxpayers\u201d be-\nfore the IRS deprives them of their property. S. Rep. \nNo. 105-174, at 67 (1998). And, as the Tax Court has \nobserved, Congress sought to ensure that the Commis-\nsioner would \u201ccollect the correct amount of tax, and do \nso by observing all applicable laws and administrative \n\n10 \n \n \nprocedures.\u201d Montgomery v. Commissioner, 122 T.C. \n1, 10 (2004). \nTo that end, \u00a7 6330 allows a taxpayer to raise is-\nsues relating to the unpaid tax and also challenge her \nliability if she did not have an earlier opportunity to \ndo so. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2). Section 6330 also gives the \ntaxpayer a chance \u201cto petition the Tax Court to contest \nthe Appeals [Office\u2019s] decision.\u201d 144 Cong. Rec. S4494 \n(daily ed. May 7, 1998) (statement of Sen. Hatch). And \nonce a taxpayer has petitioned the Tax Court, that \ncourt can enjoin any action or proceeding \u201cin respect \nof the unpaid tax or proposed levy.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(e)(1). \nThat makes sense: ensuring that the IRS is collecting \nthe correct amount of tax requires giving taxpayers an \nopportunity to dispute issues relating to the taxes \nthey haven\u2019t paid and their tax liability, and having \nthe Tax Court weigh in before the IRS can take their \nmoney. \nB. Factual and procedural background \nThis case arises from a dispute over whether the \nIRS properly credited $50,000 in overpayments from \nZuch and her ex-husband, Patrick Gennardo, to Gen-\nnardo\u2019s tax bill rather than Zuch\u2019s in the wake of their \ndivorce. Both Zuch and Gennardo maintain that the \nIRS should have credited Zuch\u2019s account, but the IRS \ninstead credited Gennardo\u2019s, sought to levy Zuch\u2019s \nproperty, and unilaterally decided to withhold over-\npayments Zuch made in later tax years. \n1. Zuch and Gennardo were married from 1993 \nto 2014. Pet. App. 7a. They separated in 2010, and \nZuch initiated divorce proceedings in 2012. CA3 \nApp. A118. During that time, the IRS assessed sub-\nstantial taxes against Zuch and Gennardo, prompting \nyears of litigation. \n\n11 \n \n \na. In 2010 and 2011, Zuch and Gennardo submit-\nted $50,000 in prepayments to the IRS for what they \nestimated would be their 2010 tax liability. Pet. \nApp. 8a. In particular, in June 2010, they submitted \nan estimated payment of $20,000 using a check drawn \nfrom a bank account listing both their names. Pet. \nApp. 8a & n.11. The form accompanying the check also \nlisted both names. Pet. App. 8a n.11, 51a. In January \n2011, Gennardo sent the IRS a check for $30,000. Pet. \nApp. 8a. The subject line of the letter accompanying \nthe check read \u201cRe: Patrick J. Gennardo and Jennifer \nZuch,\u201d and although the check was from Zuch and \nGennardo\u2019s joint bank account, the check listed only \nGennardo\u2019s name. Pet. App. 8a n.12, 51a. At the time, \nZuch and Gennardo didn\u2019t tell the IRS how to allocate \nthe payments. Pet. App. 8a. \nb. In 2012 and 2013, Zuch and Gennardo filed \nuntimely, and later amended, tax returns for 2010, \nand the IRS applied the $50,000 in prepayments to \nGennardo\u2019s, rather than Zuch\u2019s, tax bill. Pet. App. 7a-\n8a. The IRS\u2019s decision gave rise to the parties\u2019 dispute \nover Zuch\u2019s 2010 tax balance. \nIn September 2012, Zuch and Gennardo each filed \na married-filing-separately income tax return. Pet. \nApp. 7a. Zuch\u2019s return showed an adjusted gross in-\ncome of $74,493 and a $731 overpayment, and didn\u2019t \nmention the prepayments from 2010 and 2011. Pet. \nApp. 7a-8a & n.9. Gennardo\u2019s return showed an ad-\njusted gross income of $1,077,213, indicated that he \nowed $385,393 in taxes, and reported $10,000 in esti-\nmated payments. Pet. App. 8a-9a, 52a. The same day \nthat Gennardo filed his return, he also filed an offer-\nin-compromise, seeking to settle his accumulated tax \ndebts at less than the amount due. Id.; see I.R.C. \n\u00a7 7122(a). The IRS later notified him that it had \n\n12 \n \n \napplied the $50,000 in prepayments towards the \n$385,393 in taxes he owed. Pet. App. 8a. \nIn November 2012, Zuch filed an amended return \nfor 2010 to report $71,000 in additional income from a \nretirement account distribution. Pet. App. 9a. Zuch\u2019s \namended return showed that she owed the IRS \n$27,682. Id. She explained that the $50,000 in prepay-\nments should be credited to her and requested a \nrefund of $21,918. Id. In February 2013, the IRS as-\nsessed the additional $27,682 in taxes that Zuch \nreported, but it refused to credit her for the $50,000 or \nissue any refund. Id. \nGennardo also filed an amended return for 2010 \nin November 2012. Pet. App. 52a-53a. On that \namended return, he reported $0 in prepayments. Id. \nSubsequently, in March 2013, while his offer-in-com-\npromise was pending, Gennardo filed a second \namended return for 2010. Pet. App. 9a. He indicated \non that second amended return that the $50,000 in \nprepayments should be credited to Zuch, but the IRS \nstill refused to allocate it to her tax bill. Pet. App. 9a-\n10a; see Pet. App. 55a. \nc. Gennardo later submitted an amended offer-\nin-compromise in which he offered the IRS a signifi-\ncantly larger payment of tax, which the IRS accepted. \nPet. App. 10a. Even though Gennardo had asked the \nIRS to credit the $50,000 to Zuch, the IRS credited the \nentire sum to him. Id. \n2. Zuch never received a notice of deficiency from \nthe IRS. Pet. App. 9a n.13. But in August 2013, the \nIRS notified her that it intended to levy her property \nbecause she had failed to pay her 2010 tax assessment \nand explained that she had 30 days to request a \n\n13 \n \n \ncollection due process hearing before the Appeals Of-\nfice. Pet. App. 10a. \n3. Zuch timely requested a hearing. Id. At the \nhearing, Zuch challenged her \u201cunderlying tax liabil-\nity\u201d because she did not receive a notice of deficiency \nor otherwise have an opportunity to dispute it. I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B); Pet. App. 10a. Zuch argued that the \n$50,000 in prepayments should have been credited to \nher, reducing her tax liability to $0 and entitling her \nto a refund. Pet. App. 10a. \nIn September 2014, the Appeals Office rejected \nZuch\u2019s \u201c[c]hallenges to [her] [l]iability,\u201d Pet. App. 66a, \nand sustained the proposed levy. It told Zuch that it \nwas \u201cnot in a position\u201d to credit her for the $50,000 \nbecause the IRS had credited the money to Gennardo. \nPet. App. 11a. \n4. Zuch petitioned the Tax Court to review the \nAppeals Office\u2019s determination. Id. In particular, she \nsought a ruling that the $50,000 should have been ap-\nplied to her individual tax balance. Id. After the IRS \nmoved for summary judgment, the Tax Court re-\nmanded to the Appeals Office because it wasn\u2019t clear \nwhy the IRS had applied the $50,000 towards Gen-\nnardo\u2019s liability rather than Zuch\u2019s. Pet. App. 11a-\n12a. \n5. In June 2017, the Appeals Office again ruled \nagainst Zuch on the \u201c[i]ssues relating to [her] unpaid \n[underlying] liability,\u201d Pet. App. 48a, and sustained \nthe proposed levy, Pet. App. 12a. It reasoned that the \nlevy \u201cbalance[d] the need for efficient collection of \ntaxes with the taxpayer\u2019s legitimate concern that any \ncollection action be no more intrusive than necessary.\u201d \nCA3 App. A270. \n\n14 \n \n \n6. The case returned to the Tax Court. Pet. \nApp. 12a. Meanwhile, over the course of the six years \nthe \u00a7 6330 proceedings had been pending, Zuch kept \npaying her taxes for later years. In fact, she overpaid. \nBut rather than issuing her refunds, the IRS kept \nZuch\u2019s overpayments and used them to offset her \nclaimed 2010 liability. Pet. App. 12a-13a. The IRS did \nso six times, \u201conce each in 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2019, \nand twice in 2016.\u201d Id. And in April 2019, after the \ncase had returned to the Tax Court, the IRS kept \nZuch\u2019s money a final time to offset the rest of her \nclaimed 2010 tax balance, reducing it to $0. Pet. \nApp. 13a. \nThe IRS then moved to dismiss the Tax Court pro-\nceedings as moot. Id. The Tax Court granted the \nmotion. Id. The Tax Court concluded that it lacked ju-\nrisdiction over the case and that the case was moot \nbecause \u201cthere [was] no unpaid liability \u2026 upon which \na levy could be based,\u201d and the IRS was no longer \nseeking to levy Zuch\u2019s property. Pet. App. 43a. \n7. The Third Circuit vacated the Tax Court\u2019s de-\ncision, held that the Tax Court had jurisdiction under \n\u00a7 6330 to decide Zuch\u2019s challenge to her tax liability or \nunpaid tax, held that the case wasn\u2019t moot, and re-\nmanded for proceedings on the merits. Pet. App. 1a-\n39a. \nThe court first held that the Tax Court had juris-\ndiction to review the Appeals Office\u2019s determination of \nZuch\u2019s liability. Because Zuch had neither received a \nnotice of deficiency nor had an opportunity to contest \nher liability before her collection due process hearing, \nZuch could challenge \u201cthe existence or amount of [her] \nunderlying tax liability\u201d during the hearing. Pet. \nApp. 14a-15a; (quoting I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B)). And, \n\n15 \n \n \nthe court explained, \u201cZuch\u2019s argument that her esti-\nmated tax payments were erroneously allocated to her \nex-husband is a challenge to her underlying tax liabil-\nity under \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B).\u201d Pet. App. 19a. \nThe court of appeals then held that the Tax Court \nhad jurisdiction over Zuch\u2019s challenge, and that Zuch\u2019s \nchallenge was not moot, for two independent reasons. \nPet. App. 19a-38a. First, the court held that Zuch \ncould continue challenging her underlying liability be-\ncause the IRS unlawfully offset it using her \noverpayments in later years. Pet. App. 19a-25a. The \nIRS\u2019s unilateral, illegal actions, the court held, could \nnot moot the case. Pet. App. 25a. Second, in a part of \nthe opinion joined by two panel members, the court \nheld that the Tax Court had jurisdiction to review the \nAppeals Office\u2019s determination of Zuch\u2019s liability and \nissue a declaratory judgment because the parties con-\ntinued to dispute Zuch\u2019s tax liability. Pet. App. 25a-\n26a; see Pet. App. 25a-38a. And a declaratory judg-\nment, the court concluded, would redress Zuch\u2019s \ninjuries. Pet. App. 37a-38a. \n8. The IRS sought rehearing en banc, which the \ncourt of appeals denied. Pet. App. 68a-69a. It then \nsought a writ of certiorari, which this Court granted \non January 10, 2025. \n9. On March 14, 2025, Zuch filed a suit in the \nU.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey seek-\ning refunds for the 2010, 2012, 2013, and 2018 tax \nyears pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(a)(1) and I.R.C. \n\u00a7 7422(a). Compl., Zuch v. United States, No. 2:25-cv-\n01900 (D.N.J. Mar. 14, 2025). If successful, Zuch will \nrecover approximately two-thirds of the taxes the IRS \ncollected after it refused to credit her for the estimated \npayments. See Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 108-09. But Zuch is unable \n\n16 \n \n \nto request the return of approximately $20,000 in \noverpayments the IRS kept from the 2014 and 2015 \ntax years, due to the onerous jurisdictional prerequi-\nsites to filing a refund suit. Compl. \u00b6 109. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI. \nThe Tax Court had jurisdiction to review \nZuch\u2019s challenge relating to her unpaid tax or under-\nlying tax liability, and to adjudicate her entitlement \nto the estimated payments. The Tax Court retained \nthat jurisdiction and authority to issue a binding rul-\ning even after the IRS stopped pursuing the levy. This \ncase isn\u2019t moot.  \nA.  The Tax Court had, and retained, jurisdiction \nto review the Appeals Office\u2019s determination of Zuch\u2019s \nestimated payment dispute. \n1. Section 6330\u2019s plain text makes clear that the \nTax Court has authority to review the Appeals Office\u2019s \ndetermination of a taxpayer\u2019s challenge relating to her \nunpaid tax or underlying liability. Section 6330 pro-\nvides that a taxpayer may raise \u201cany relevant issue \nrelating to the unpaid tax\u201d at a collection due process \nhearing, and also may raise a challenge to her \u201cunder-\nlying tax liability\u201d when she didn\u2019t have an \nopportunity to do so before. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2). The \nAppeals Office\u2019s \u201cdetermination\u201d must \u201ctake [those is-\nsues] into consideration,\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(3), and the \nTax Court \u201cshall have jurisdiction\u201d to review that de-\ntermination, I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). Nothing in those \nprovisions makes jurisdiction turn on a continuing-\nlevy requirement, much less satisfies the requirement \nthat jurisdictional prerequisites be clearly stated, see \nBoechler, 596 U.S. at 203. The Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction \nunder \u00a7 6330 thus doesn\u2019t vanish when the IRS stops \npursuing a levy. \n\n17 \n \n \n2.  Context confirms that Congress gave the Tax \nCourt continuing jurisdiction under \u00a7 6330 to review \nAppeals Office determinations, including their resolu-\ntion of unpaid tax and tax liability issues. Section \n6330(c)(2)(B) ensures that a taxpayer has a chance to \nchallenge the unpaid tax and her underlying liability \nbefore she must pay or face a levy, and without initi-\nating new litigation against the federal government to \nseek a refund, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(a)(1); I.R.C. \n\u00a7 7422(a).  \n3.  The Tax Court had jurisdiction to review the \nAppeals Office\u2019s determination, including Zuch\u2019s enti-\ntlement to the estimated payments. In proceedings \nbefore the Appeals Office, Zuch challenged the IRS\u2019s \nrefusal to apply the estimated payments to her tax \nbill. The Appeals Office rejected her arguments. Zuch \nthen petitioned the Tax Court for review of the Ap-\npeals Office\u2019s determination\u2014including its resolution \nof the unpaid tax or underlying liability dispute. And \nthe Tax Court had jurisdiction under \u00a7 6330 to review \nthe determination of those issues.  \nB. Zuch\u2019s case wasn\u2019t mooted when the IRS de-\ncided that it no longer needed the levy. A case is moot \nonly if the parties no longer have a concrete interest \nin the outcome, and the court can\u2019t issue any relief \nthat would redress a party\u2019s injury. But here, the Tax \nCourt could issue a ruling deciding whether Zuch is \nentitled to have the $50,000 in estimated payments \napplied to her tax bill. So both parties have an interest \nhere. If Zuch prevails, the IRS is likely to issue a re-\nfund, and if the government prevails, the IRS will \nkeep her money. And win or lose, a judgment from the \nTax Court will be preclusive in the refund suit that \nZuch has now filed in the U.S. District Court for the \nDistrict of New Jersey. \n\n18 \n \n \nII. The government\u2019s counterarguments are un-\npersuasive.  \nA. The government claims that the Tax Court\u2019s \njurisdiction to review a taxpayer\u2019s liability challenge \nrequires a continuing attempt to levy the taxpayer\u2019s \nproperty. That is incorrect\u2014the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdic-\ntion didn\u2019t disappear once the IRS no longer needed \nthe levy. \n1. There is no textual basis for the government\u2019s \ncontinuing-levy requirement. To be sure, \u00a7 6330 men-\ntions the word \u201clevy\u201d\u2014after all, a taxpayer can initiate \nadministrative collection due process proceedings be-\nfore the Appeals Office only after being notified that \nthe IRS is going to levy her property. See I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(a)(3)(B), (b)(1). But once the Appeals Office is-\nsues a determination, the taxpayer can seek Tax \nCourt review of the determination under \u00a7 6330(d)(1). \nSection 6330(d)(1)\u2019s plain terms impose no continuing-\nlevy requirement, much less a \u201cclearly state[d]\u201d juris-\ndictional requirement, Boechler, 596 U.S. at 203. \nWhat\u2019s more, the presumption favoring judicial re-\nview of agency actions supports reading \u00a7 6330(d)(1) \nto confer jurisdiction even if the government abandons \nits levy efforts. See Guerrero-Lasprilla v. Barr, 589 \nU.S. 221, 229 (2020). In arguing otherwise, what the \nIRS is really saying is that, in its view, the Tax Court \ncannot redress a taxpayer\u2019s pocketbook injury when \nthere is no pending levy. But that\u2019s not the case, ei-\nther, as this case makes plain.  \n2. Section 6330\u2019s history and purpose confirm \nthat the Tax Court retains jurisdiction over an unpaid \ntax or liability challenge even after the IRS says it \ndoesn\u2019t need a levy anymore. Congress crafted \u00a7 6330 \nas remedial legislation in response to the IRS\u2019s \n\n19 \n \n \nabusive collection practices as part of a statutory \nscheme to increase fairness to taxpayers by allowing \nthem to challenge what they owe before they pay or \nhave their property seized. In light of that remedial \npurpose, \u00a7 6330 should be construed to mean what it \nsays\u2014the Tax Court has jurisdiction over the Appeals \nOffice\u2019s \u201cdetermination.\u201d \n3. Royal Canin doesn\u2019t suggest otherwise. The \ngovernment argues that the IRS fundamentally al-\ntered the basis of the suit when it decided not to seek \nthe levy. But the basis of the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction \nis the Appeals Office\u2019s determination, not any levy. \nAnd decisions holding that jurisdiction depends on the \nstate of play at the time the suit is brought show that \neven assuming \u00a7 6330 contains a pending-levy re-\nquirement, that requirement turns on the time of \nfiling and thus is met here: there was a levy pending \nwhen Zuch petitioned the Tax Court. \n4.  Policy can\u2019t salvage the government\u2019s position, \neither. The government claims that, if the Tax Court \nhas jurisdiction to review a taxpayer\u2019s liability in a \n\u00a7 6330 proceeding after the IRS determines it no \nlonger needs the levy, the floodgates will open and \n\u00a7 6330 proceedings will become a forum for all kinds \nof liability challenges. But the taxpayer may raise a \nliability issue in a collection due process proceeding \nonly when she did not have an earlier opportunity to \ndo so. Plus, the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction is tied to the \nissues raised before, and determined by, the Appeals \nOffice in the first place. There\u2019s no risk that the Tax \nCourt will begin exercising free-wheeling jurisdiction \nover \u201cgeneral\u201d liability disputes. What\u2019s more, the \nquestion presented rarely arises, and when it does, it\u2019s \nonly because of \u201cthe IRS\u2019s own recalcitrance.\u201d \nBoechler, 596 U.S. at 207. So even if there were a \n\n20 \n \n \nfloodgates problem, it would be the government\u2019s own \ndoing. \nB. The government claims that the Tax Court \nlacks authority to issue a judgment regarding Zuch\u2019s \nentitlement to the estimated payments. In the govern-\nment\u2019s view, the Tax Court can enjoin only a collection \naction in a \u00a7 6330 proceeding, and can\u2019t issue declara-\ntory relief at all. That argument is meritless. \nSection 6330(d)(1) authorizes the Tax Court to deter-\nmine the taxpayer\u2019s unpaid tax and underlying \nliability, and issue a judgment about those issues. And \n\u00a7 6330(e)(1), which allows injunctions \u201cin respect of \nthe unpaid tax or proposed levy,\u201d confirms that the \nTax Court can issue declaratory relief determining a \ntaxpayer\u2019s rights in a challenge involving her liability \nor unpaid tax. The DJA doesn\u2019t provide otherwise, be-\ncause \u00a7 6330(e)(1) exempts \u00a7 6330 from the DJA\u2019s \nprohibition on declaratory relief in most tax cases.  \nC. The government\u2019s other mootness arguments \nfail, too. The government contends that the case is \nmoot because, once the IRS decides not to pursue a \nlevy, \u201cthe issue that prompted the Section 6330 pro-\nceeding is no longer \u2018live.\u2019\u201d Br. 21. But the mootness \ninquiry asks whether the parties retain any interest \nin the outcome of the litigation, and thus whether the \ncourt can redress the plaintiff\u2019s injury. The parties \nhave a concrete interest here, because the Tax Court \ncan decide whether Zuch or the IRS is entitled to the \nmoney.  \nD. Finally, the government mentions in a foot-\nnote that Zuch\u2019s challenge relates to her unpaid tax, \nrather than her underlying liability. But the govern-\nment concedes (Br. 25 n.3) that the dispute is \n\n21 \n \n \nimmaterial. Indeed, as Zuch has explained, the Tax \nCourt had, and retained, jurisdiction either way. \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe Tax Court had jurisdiction under I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330 to review and rule on Zuch\u2019s unpaid \ntax or tax liability, so the case isn\u2019t moot. \nA. The Tax Court had jurisdiction to review \nthe Appeals Office\u2019s determination of \nZuch\u2019s entitlement to the estimated \npayments. \nSection 6330\u2019s text and context make clear that \nthe Tax Court had jurisdiction to review Zuch\u2019s chal-\nlenge to her unpaid tax or underlying tax liability, \neven after the IRS stopped pursuing the levy. \n1. Section 6330\u2019s plain text states that \nthe Tax Court has jurisdiction to \nreview \nthe \nAppeals \nOffice\u2019s \n\u201cdetermination\u201d \nof \na \ntaxpayer\u2019s \nchallenge to \u201cany relevant issue \nrelating to [her] unpaid tax\u201d or her \n\u201cunderlying liability.\u201d  \na. During the collection due process hearing, the \nAppeals Office can determine \u201cany relevant issue re-\nlating to the unpaid tax,\u201d and, if the taxpayer \u201cdid not \nreceive any statutory notice of deficiency \u2026 or did not \notherwise have an opportunity to dispute\u201d it, the tax-\npayer may also challenge \u201cthe existence or amount of \nthe underlying tax liability.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2). A tax-\npayer challenges her underlying tax liability by \ndisputing \u201cthe amounts that the Commissioner as-\nsessed for a particular tax period.\u201d Jeffers v. \nCommissioner, 992 F.3d 649, 653 n.4 (7th Cir. 2021); \naccord Montgomery, 122 T.C. at 7-8. For example, the \n\n22 \n \n \ntaxpayer challenges her underlying tax liability when \nshe claims that the IRS misapplied a credit, if properly \napplying the credit \u201cwould eliminate the outstanding \ntax liability.\u201d Peoplease, LLC v. Commissioner, \nNo. 2161-24L, 2025 WL 429626, at *2 (T.C. Feb. 6, \n2025). Similarly, when a taxpayer raises challenges \nrelating to the unpaid portion of the underlying tax \nliability, she raises an issue related to the unpaid tax. \nSee Internal Revenue Service Chief Counsel Notice \nCC-2014-002 at 3 (May 5, 2014) (\u201c\u2018Unpaid tax\u2019 refers \nto that part of the underlying tax liability not paid by \nthe taxpayer.\u201d).  \nOnce the Appeals Office issues a determination, \nthe taxpayer may \u201cpetition the Tax Court for review \nof [the Appeals Office\u2019s] determination,\u201d \u201cand the Tax \nCourt shall have jurisdiction with respect to such mat-\nter.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). That means the Tax Court \nreviews the \u201cdetermination\u201d of all \u201cthe issues\u201d raised \nduring the hearing. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2), (c)(3)(B). So \nwhen the Tax Court reviews the Appeals Office\u2019s de-\ntermination, it can resolve any dispute about any \nissue relating to the unpaid tax or the taxpayer\u2019s un-\nderlying tax liability that the taxpayer properly raised \nbefore the Appeals Office. See id. \nb. The Tax Court doesn\u2019t lose its jurisdiction to \nresolve a challenge to the Appeals Office determina-\ntion just because the IRS decides to stop pursuing the \nlevy. Congress provided that the Tax Court \u201cshall \nhave jurisdiction\u201d to review the Appeals Office\u2019s deter-\nmination. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1) (emphasis added). That \nreview necessarily reaches all live \u201cissues\u201d involved in \nthe Appeal\u2019s Office\u2019s determination. And those issues \nexpressly include, as relevant here, \u201cany relevant is-\nsue relating to the unpaid tax\u201d and any \u201cchallenges to \nthe existence or amount of the underlying tax \n\n23 \n \n \nliability,\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2), (c)(3)(B). So long as an \nunpaid tax or liability issue remains disputed, nothing \nin \u00a7 6330 suggests the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to re-\nview the question vanishes when the IRS collects the \namount due another way and no longer needs the levy. \nAt most, whether there is a pending levy could affect \nwhat kind of relief the Tax Court can grant. But it \ndoesn\u2019t present any question about jurisdiction under \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1). As explained below (at 28-29), the Tax \nCourt can rule on a taxpayer\u2019s unpaid tax or underly-\ning liability when there are live disputes about those \nissues. \nc. Section 6330\u2019s history confirms that Congress \ndeliberately vested the Tax Court with jurisdiction to \nresolve disputes over a taxpayer\u2019s underlying liability \nand wanted the Tax Court to retain that jurisdiction. \nBefore 2006, \u00a7 6330 provided that taxpayers could \nseek review of the Appeals Office\u2019s determination in \nfederal district court \u201cif the Tax Court [did] not have \njurisdiction of the underlying tax liability.\u201d I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1) (2000). Practically, that language meant \nthat the Tax Court had jurisdiction to review the Ap-\npeals Office\u2019s determination of a liability dispute only \nif the dispute concerned income, estate, or gift taxes, \nbecause the Tax Court already had jurisdiction to re-\nview those kinds of disputes in deficiency proceedings. \nMoore v. Commissioner, 114 T.C. 171, 175 (2000). But \nCongress changed that in 2006 and made clear that \nthe Tax Court \u201cshall\u201d review the taxpayer\u2019s disputed \nliability in all cases. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). Thus, Con-\ngress ensured that \u201cthe Tax Court [has] jurisdiction \nover issues arising from a collection due process hear-\ning\u201d by \u201cconsolidat[ing] all judicial review of \u2026 \ncollection due process determinations,\u201d including a \ntaxpayer\u2019s underlying tax liability, in the Tax Court. \n\n24 \n \n \nStaff of J. Comm. on Taxation, 109th Cong., Descrip-\ntion of the Revenue Provisions Contained in the \nPresident\u2019s Fiscal Year 2007 Budget Proposal 230-31 \n(Comm. Print 2006); accord Staff of J. Comm. On Tax-\nation, 109th Cong., Technical Explanation of H.R. 4, \nThe \u201cPension Protection Act of 2006,\u201d as Passed By the \nHouse on July 28, 2006, and as Considered by the Sen-\nate on August 3, 2006 (Comm. Print. 2006). \n2. Statutory \ncontext \nconfirms \nthat \nCongress \ngave \nthe \nTax \nCourt \ncontinuing jurisdiction to resolve \nissues relating to the unpaid tax and \ntax liability disputes. \nStatutory context shows why Congress likely gave \nthe Tax Court authority to review the issues underly-\ning the Appeals Office\u2019s determination. \nAs noted (at 6-7), in some circumstances, the IRS \nissues a notice of deficiency to a taxpayer, who can \nthen challenge her assessed liability in Tax Court be-\nfore the IRS collects. See I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6212(a), 6512(a). \nBut sometimes the taxpayer doesn\u2019t receive a notice of \ndeficiency or have another opportunity to dispute the \nliability before the IRS seeks to levy the taxpayer\u2019s \nproperty, as in Zuch\u2019s case. See I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B). \nTo ensure that taxpayers have that opportunity, Con-\ngress gave taxpayers the right to dispute their \nliability. Id. Similarly, Congress gave taxpayers the \nright to raise \u201cany relevant issue relating to the un-\npaid tax,\u201d no matter whether they received a notice of \ndeficiency or otherwise had the opportunity to chal-\nlenge the liability. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A). And \nCongress directed the Appeals Office and Tax Court to \nresolve those challenges. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(3), (d)(1). \n\n25 \n \n \nEven if the IRS is able to terminate the levy after \nthe taxpayer initiates \u00a7 6330 proceedings, it makes \nsense for the Tax Court to finish resolving the unpaid \ntax or underlying liability dispute if it remains live. \nAfter all, if the dispute continues past the levy, closing \nthe Tax Court\u2019s doors would simply require the tax-\npayer to file another lawsuit, this time seeking a \nrefund under I.R.C. \u00a7 7422 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(a)(1). \nAnd that would undermine the \u201cdesign[]\u201d of the Tax \nCode \u201cto insure an orderly administration of the reve-\nnue.\u2019\u201d United States v. Clintwood Elkhorn Mining Co., \n553 U.S. 1, 11 (2008). It also would contravene the \ngovernment\u2019s fundamental obligation to \u201cturn square \ncorners in dealing with the people,\u201d Regents of the Uni-\nversity of California, 591 U.S. at 24, by pulling the rug \nout from under a taxpayer who has been litigating \nagainst the IRS for years and forcing her to start new \nlitigation in a different forum.  \nCongress passed \u00a7 6330 to avoid heavy-handed \nIRS tactics, not authorize them in the form of jurisdic-\ntional gamesmanship. And in what is known as the \nTaxpayer Bill of Rights, Congress has also instructed \nthe IRS to \u201censure that employees of the Internal Rev-\nenue Service are familiar with and act in accord with \ntaxpayer rights as afforded by other provisions of this \ntitle.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 7803(a)(3); see Taxpayer Bill of Rights, \nIRS, https://www.irs.gov/taxpayer-bill-of-rights (last \nvisited March 17, 2025). Those rights include \u201cthe \nright to pay no more than the correct amount of tax\u201d; \n\u201cthe right to challenge the position of the Internal \nRevenue Service and be heard\u201d; \u201cthe right to appeal a \ndecision of the Internal Revenue Service in an inde-\npendent forum\u201d; and \u201cthe right to finality.\u201d I.R.C. \n\u00a7 7803(a)(3)(C)-(F). Those rights underscore that the \nTax Court\u2019s jurisdiction under \u00a7 6330 does not vanish \n\n26 \n \n \njust because the IRS seeks to cut off the taxpayer\u2019s \nrights to challenge the agency\u2019s position. By the same \ntoken, nothing in I.R.C. \u00a7 6402, which governs offsets, \npurports to limit the Tax Court\u2019s authority to deter-\nmine the taxpayer\u2019s unpaid tax or liability under \n\u00a7 6330, and reading the provisions that way would in-\nsert words into the statute and contravene the \nTaxpayer Bill of Rights.  \n3. The Tax Court had jurisdiction under \n\u00a7 6330 to review the Appeals Office\u2019s \ndetermination, \nincluding \nits \nresolution of Zuch\u2019s entitlement to \nthe estimated payments. \nThe Tax Court had jurisdiction under \u00a7 6330 to re-\nview the Appeals Office\u2019s determination that Zuch \nwas not entitled to the estimated payments. \nZuch challenged the IRS\u2019s allocation of the esti-\nmated tax payments in the collection due process \nproceedings. In particular, she claimed that she did \nnot owe the IRS the $27,682 for the 2010 tax year be-\ncause the estimated payments should have been \ncredited to her. Pet. App. 9a; see Jeffers, 992 F.3d at \n653 n.4; Peoplease, 2025 WL 429626, at *2. Zuch had \na right to dispute that liability (or unpaid tax, if the \nIRS would prefer to classify it that way). Zuch did not \nreceive a notice of deficiency or otherwise have an op-\nportunity to challenge her claimed liability. Pet. \nApp. 10a. Regardless, Zuch was also entitled to raise \nher challenge as a \u201crelevant issue relating to the un-\npaid tax.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A).  \nAfter the Appeals Office made its determination, \nZuch timely petitioned the Tax Court for review. CA3 \nApp. A24-A30; see CA3 App. A266-270; Pet. App. 41a-\n42a. The Tax Court then had jurisdiction over the \n\n27 \n \n \nAppeals Office\u2019s decision, including the dispute over \nthe estimated payments. See I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2), \n(c)(3)(B), (d)(1). \nTo be sure, while the case was before the Tax \nCourt\u2014and after more than six years of litigation\u2014\nthe IRS announced that it was abandoning the levy. \nBut that didn\u2019t deprive the Tax Court of jurisdiction \nunder \u00a7 6330. Nothing in \u00a7 6330 purports to condition \nthe Tax Court\u2019s ongoing jurisdiction on the IRS\u2019s con-\ntinued pursuit of a levy. \nB. Zuch\u2019s case did not become moot when \nthe IRS decided to stop pursuing the \nlevy, because the parties disputed, and \nthe \nTax \nCourt \nhad \nthe \npower \nto \nadjudicate, Zuch\u2019s entitlement to the \nestimated payments. \nZuch\u2019s case isn\u2019t moot just because the IRS de-\ncided it no longer needed a levy. Mootness comes into \nplay only when the parties no longer have a concrete \ninterest in the outcome. But both Zuch and the IRS \nhave a concrete interest here because the Tax Court \ncan still decide Zuch\u2019s challenge to the Appeals Of-\nfice\u2019s \nunderlying \nliability \nor \nunpaid \ntax \ndeterminations and then rule that Zuch is entitled to \nthe estimated payments. If the Tax Court so rules, the \nIRS is likely to abide by that ruling and issue a refund. \nBut even if the IRS doesn\u2019t issue a refund, the Tax \nCourt\u2019s judgment would be preclusive in the refund \naction Zuch has brought in the District of New Jersey.  \n\n28 \n \n \n1. A case becomes moot only when the \nparties no longer have a concrete \ninterest \nin \nthe outcome \nof the \nlitigation and judicial relief is not \nlikely to redress any injury.  \nThe mootness inquiry asks whether standing \u201cex-\nists throughout the proceedings.\u201d Uzuegbunam v. \nPreczewski, 592 U.S. 279, 282 (2021). The \u201cirreducible \nconstitutional minimum of standing contains three el-\nements\u201d: \n(1) injury \nin \nfact, \n(2) causation \n(i.e., \ntraceability), and (3) redressability. Lujan v. Defend-\ners of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992). \u201cAs long \nas the parties have a concrete interest, however small, \nin the outcome of the litigation, the case is not moot.\u201d \nCampbell-Ewald Co. v. Gomez, 577 U.S. 153, 161 \n(2016). Thus, redressability requires only that judicial \nrelief \u201clikely\u201d will redress an injury, Federal Election \nCommission v. Cruz, 596 U.S. 289, 296 (2022), not \nthat \u201ca favorable decision will relieve\u201d \u201cevery injury,\u201d \nLarson v. Valente, 456 U.S. 228, 243-44 & n.15 (1982) \n(first emphasis added).  \n2. Zuch\u2019s challenge isn\u2019t moot because a \nfavorable \nTax \nCourt \nruling \non \nunderlying liability or unpaid tax \nwould likely redress her pocketbook \ninjury. \nZuch satisfies all three requirements of standing. \nShe suffered a concrete injury when the IRS applied \nthe $50,000 in estimated payments to her ex-hus-\nband\u2019s balance, rather than her own. See, e.g., \nTransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413, 425 \n(2021). If the IRS had applied the estimated payments \nto Zuch\u2019s account\u2014as both she and her ex-husband \nhad \nrequested\u2014Zuch \nwould \nhave \ngotten \nher \n\n29 \n \n \noverpayments back in later years. But, having refused \nto apply the estimated payments to Zuch\u2019s tax bill, the \nIRS kept her overpayments instead. Zuch\u2019s monetary \ninjury is thus traceable to the IRS\u2019s refusal to apply \nthe $50,000 in estimated payments to her 2010 tax \nbill. See Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Or-\nganization, 426 U.S. 26, 41-42 (1976). And the Tax \nCourt can redress Zuch\u2019s injury by ruling that the Ap-\npeals Office was wrong about her liability or unpaid \ntax and thus determining that Zuch is entitled to the \n$50,000 in estimated payments. \nAs noted, the Appeals Office\u2019s \u201cdetermination\u201d \n\u201cshall take into consideration\u201d \u201cthe issues raised\u201d at \nthe hearing, I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(3)(B), including \u201cany rel-\nevant issue relating to the unpaid tax\u201d and \u201cthe \nexistence or amount of the underlying tax liability,\u201d \nI.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2). And because the Tax Court \u201cshall \nhave jurisdiction\u201d to review \u201csuch determination,\u201d \nI.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1), the Tax Court can decide a tax-\npayer\u2019s unpaid tax or underlying tax liability, too. \nAccord Michael I. Saltzman & Leslie Book, IRS Prac-\ntice & Procedure \u00a7 14B.16[4][a] (updated Oct. 2024). \nIn Zuch\u2019s case, that means the Tax Court can rule on \nwhether she is entitled to credit for the estimated pay-\nments, underscoring both parties\u2019 concrete interest in \nthe outcome of the case. See Pet. App. 33a-34a, 42a. \nIf the Tax Court rules that Zuch is entitled to the \nestimated payments, the IRS is likely to issue Zuch a \nrefund. That\u2019s because \u201cit is substantially likely that \n[the IRS] would abide by\u201d that \u201cauthoritative\u201d holding \n\u201cby the [Tax] Court.\u201d Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 \nU.S. 788, 803 (1992); accord Reed v. Goertz, 598 U.S. \n230, 234 (2023); Pet. App. 38a. Indeed, it would be \nquite remarkable for the IRS to simply ignore the Tax \nCourt and decide not to return to Zuch the money that \n\n30 \n \n \na court has determined the IRS has no legal right to \nkeep. That is especially true because the Tax Court \nnot only has authority to review and rule on the un-\nderlying \nliability \nand \nunpaid \ntax \nissues \nin \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1), but it also has authority to put those rul-\nings into a declaratory judgment under \u00a7 6330(e), as \nexplained below (at 40-42). The consequence is that \nthe Tax Court will have \u201c\u2018ordered a change in a legal \nstatus,\u2019 and \u2018the practical consequence of that change \nwould amount to a significant increase in the likeli-\nhood\u2019\u201d that the IRS will give Zuch her money back. \nReed, 598 U.S. at 234. The Tax Court\u2019s authority to \nissue a \u201cdefinitive determination of the legal rights of \nthe parties,\u201d Medtronic, Inc. v. Mirowski Family Ven-\ntures, LLC, 571 U.S. 191, 200 (2014); see Haaland v. \nBrackeen, 599 U.S. 255, 293 (2023), leaves no doubt \nthat the court has the power to grant effective relief. \nEven if the IRS doesn\u2019t issue Zuch a refund, Zuch \nhas filed a refund suit in the District of New Jersey \nunder I.R.C. \u00a7 7422, and the Tax Court\u2019s ruling would \nhave preclusive effect in that suit. \u201cUnder the doctrine \nof issue preclusion, \u2018a prior judgment forecloses suc-\ncessive litigation of an issue of fact or law actually \nlitigated and resolved in a valid court determination \nessential to the prior judgment.\u2019\u201d Herrera v. Wyoming, \n587 U.S. 329, 342 (2019) (alterations adopted). \u201cThe \nidea is straightforward: Once a court has decided an \nissue, it is \u2018forever settled as between the parties.\u2019\u201d \nB&B Hardware, Inc. v. Hargis Industries, Inc., 575 \nU.S. 138, 147 (2015). That goes for declaratory relief \nissued in an earlier case, too. E.g., 18 Charles A. \nWright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Pro-\ncedure \u00a7 4421 (3d ed. updated June 2024). And the \ndoctrine applies \u201ceven if the issue recurs in the context \n\n31 \n \n \nof a different claim.\u201d Taylor v. Sturgell, 553 U.S. 880, \n892 (2008). \nHere, Zuch\u2019s entitlement to the estimated pay-\nments is an \u201cissue of \u2026 law\u201d that would be \u201cactually \nlitigated and resolved\u201d in the Tax Court proceeding \nand \u201cessential to\u201d the Tax Court\u2019s decision on Zuch\u2019s \nunpaid tax or underlying liability. Herrera, 587 U.S. \nat 342. Thus, the Tax Court\u2019s judgment would be pre-\nclusive in the refund suit Zuch has recently filed in the \nDistrict of New Jersey, and that court likely would or-\nder the government to issue a refund. See, e.g., \nParklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 U.S. 322, 325, 332-\n33 (1979). \nII. The IRS\u2019s counterarguments lack merit. \nA. The Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to review \nwhether Zuch was entitled to the \nprepayments didn\u2019t dissolve once the \nIRS no longer needed the levy. \nThe government claims (Br. 16-21), that the Tax \nCourt has jurisdiction under \u00a7 6330 to review a tax-\npayer\u2019s liability only if the IRS continues threatening \nto levy the taxpayer\u2019s property. In the government\u2019s \nview, \u00a7 6330\u2019s text, history, and \u201cfunction\u201d show that \n\u00a7 6330 focuses only on whether a levy can proceed, and \nthe Tax Court thus lacks jurisdiction when the IRS \ndecides it no longer needs a levy. The government also \nwarns that allowing the Tax Court to review live dis-\nputes about unpaid tax or taxpayer liability when no \nlevy is pending would vastly expand Tax Court juris-\ndiction. Those arguments fail. Section 6330\u2019s text, \nhistory, and remedial purpose, plus time-of-filing \nrules in other contexts, all confirm that the Tax Court \nretains jurisdiction under \u00a7 6330 to review a tax-\npayer\u2019s unpaid tax or underlying liability, even when \n\n32 \n \n \nthe IRS abandons its levy. And the government\u2019s pol-\nicy concern is meritless. \n1. There is no textual basis in \u00a7 6330 for \nthe \ngovernment\u2019s \ncontinuing-levy \nrequirement. \na. The government contends that without a \nthreatened levy, there is nothing for the \u201cunderlying \ntax liability\u201d to \u201cunderlie.\u201d Br. 26. So by implication, \nthe government claims, \u00a7 6330 jurisdiction turns on a \nthreatened levy. Br. 24-27. That argument fails. \nSection 6330(d)(1) makes clear that the Tax Court \nhas jurisdiction in \u00a7 6330 proceedings to review the \nAppeals Office\u2019s determination of the issues raised in \na collection due process hearing. Supra pp. 21-23. It \nsays that \u201cthe Tax Court shall have jurisdiction\u201d to re-\nview the Appeals Office\u2019s \u201cdetermination\u201d\u2014which \nincludes all the issues the Appeals Office was required \nto consider during the hearing, not just whether the \nlevy can proceed. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1); see I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(c)(2), (c)(3)(B). The \u201cunderlying liability\u201d lan-\nguage appears in the provisions of \u00a7 6330 listing the \nmatters a taxpayer may raise at the collection due pro-\ncess hearing. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B). The Appeals \nOffice\u2019s determination thus triggers the Tax Court\u2019s \njurisdiction under \u00a7 6330, and the IRS\u2019s actions after \nthe Appeals Office issues the determination have no \nbearing on that jurisdiction. \nWhat\u2019s more, even assuming the phrase \u201cunderly-\ning tax liability\u201d implies that there must be a proposed \nlevy at the outset of the collection due process hearing \n(and there was here), nothing in \u00a7 6330 conditions the \nTax Court\u2019s exercise of \u00a7 6330 jurisdiction on the IRS\u2019s \ncontinued pursuit of a levy. To the contrary, \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1) refers to the Tax Court\u2019s review of a \n\n33 \n \n \n\u201cdetermination\u201d by the Appeals Office. And even if \n\u00a7 6330 required a pending levy at the outset of Tax \nCourt proceedings, that requirement would be satis-\nfied because there was a threatened levy pending \nwhen Zuch petitioned the Tax Court. Infra pp. 38-39. \nThat makes sense. Zuch continues to be aggrieved by \nthe Appeals Office\u2019s determination upholding the \nIRS\u2019s liability assessment, even though the IRS claims \nit no longer needs the levy. \nViewing Zuch\u2019s challenge as one \u201crelating to the \nunpaid tax\u201d doesn\u2019t mean the Tax Court lost jurisdic-\ntion to review the dispute, either. That\u2019s because the \n$27,682 the IRS claims Zuch owed for the 2010 tax \nyear was \u201cunpaid\u201d when she petitioned the Tax Court \nin 2014. See Pet. App. 11a. \nb. The government also claims that the text of \n\u00a7 6330 is \u201cnarrowly focused\u201d on \u201cwhether the IRS may \ngo forward with its proposed levy,\u201d from the title for \nthe section to the provisions describing the beginning \nof collection due process proceedings and granting the \nTax Court jurisdiction. Br. 17; see Br. 17-20. Not so. \nFor starters, the title of a provision is \u201cnot meant \nto take the place of the detailed provisions of the text\u201d; \nnor is it \u201cnecessarily designed to be a reference guide \nor a synopsis.\u201d Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. \nBaltimore & Ohio Railroad Co., 331 U.S. 519, 528 \n(1947). What\u2019s more, even though a taxpayer can ini-\ntiate collection due process proceedings with the \nAppeals Office when the IRS seeks to levy, see I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(a)(1), the provisions that authorize the Tax \nCourt to review a taxpayer\u2019s liability challenge\u2014\n\u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B) and (d)(1)\u2014do not \u201cfocus[] on\u201d a levy. \nSection 6330(c)(2)(B), for instance, allows taxpayers in \nsome situations to \u201craise at the hearing challenges to \n\n34 \n \n \nthe existence or amount of the underlying tax liabil-\nity.\u201d And \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A) differentiates \u201crelevant \nissue[s] relating to the unpaid tax\u201d from issues about \n\u201cthe proposed levy.\u201d Section 6330(d)(1), moreover, \nstates that the taxpayer may \u201cpetition the Tax Court \nfor review of such determination (and the Tax Court \nshall have jurisdiction with respect to such matter).\u201d \nNo continuing-levy requirement there. \nc. Next, the government says that \u00a7 6330(d)(1)\u2019s \nreference to the Appeals Office\u2019s \u201cdetermination\u201d im-\nplies that Tax Court jurisdiction hinges on a \nthreatened levy because the \u201cdetermination\u201d is about \nonly \u201cwhether the levy may go forward.\u201d Br. 19-20. \nThat\u2019s wrong, too. Section 6330(d)(1) authorizes the \nTax Court to review that \u201cdetermination,\u201d which nec-\nessarily involves reviewing the Appeals Office\u2019s \nresolution of each issue raised at the collection due \nprocess hearing. Supra pp. 21-23. That includes, \nwhere relevant, the taxpayer\u2019s unpaid tax or underly-\ning liability, see I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2), (c)(3)(B)\u2014\ndeterminations, as this very case shows, with signifi-\ncance beyond whether a levy may proceed. Those \nrulings determine who keeps the money both parties \nclaim is legally theirs. And as the government admits \n(Br. 19-20), the Tax Court\u2019s resolution of those issues \nis part and parcel of the determination. Nothing in \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1) conditions the Tax Court\u2019s review of that \ndetermination\u2014and all the issues it resolves\u2014on a \ncontinuing levy. \nd. The government\u2019s atextual continuing-levy re-\nquirement fails for another reason: \u201cthe presumption \nfavoring judicial review of administrative action,\u201d \nGuerrero-Lasprilla, 589 U.S. at 229, weighs in favor of \nTax Court jurisdiction. The \u201cstrong presumption\u201d of \njudicial review directs that \u201cwhen a statutory \n\n35 \n \n \nprovision \u2018is reasonably susceptible to divergent inter-\npretation,\u2019\u201d courts must \u201cadopt the reading that \naccords with traditional understandings and basic \nprinciples: that executive determinations generally \nare subject to judicial review.\u201d Id. And where applica-\nble, the \u201cpresumption can only be overcome by \u2018clear \nand convincing evidence\u2019 of congressional intent to \npreclude judicial review.\u201d Id. Those principles also \nalign with this Court\u2019s recent recognition in the \u00a7 6330 \ncontext that jurisdictional requirements must be \n\u201cclearly state[d].\u201d Boechler, 596 U.S. at 203. \nHere, \u00a7 6330 is susceptible to one interpretation: \nthe Tax Court retains jurisdiction to review a deter-\nmination even if the IRS says it no longer needs the \nlevy. Supra pp. 21-26. Section 6330(d)(1) doesn\u2019t men-\ntion levies, much less contain a clear continuing-levy \nrequirement. But even if another reasonable interpre-\ntation were possible, it is far from clear that Congress \nintended to insulate the Appeals Office\u2019s unpaid tax \nand liability determinations when the IRS stops pur-\nsuing a levy. See Pet. Br. 34. \nThe presumption doesn\u2019t become irrelevant here \njust because Zuch can file a refund suit and obtain ju-\ndicial review of her entitlement to the estimated \npayments that way, as the government contends (id.). \nThe \u201cadministrative action\u201d at issue here is the Ap-\npeals Office\u2019s determination. Guerrero-Lasprilla, 589 \nU.S. at 229. So the question is whether that determi-\nnation is reviewable in the Tax Court under \u00a7 6330\u2014\nnot whether Zuch may obtain review of another ac-\ntion, in a different court, and under a different Code \nprovision. The presumption applies in answering the \nformer question. And the answer is that the Tax Court \nretains jurisdiction. \n\n36 \n \n \n2. The \ngovernment \nmisconstrues \n\u00a7 6330\u2019s history and downplays its \nremedial \npurpose, \nwhich \nboth \nsupport \nthe \nTax \nCourt\u2019s \n\u00a7 6330 \njurisdiction to review unpaid tax and \nliability disputes even if the IRS no \nlonger pursues the levy. \nThe government claims (Br. 22-23) that because \nCongress added \u00a7 6330 in 1998 to allow taxpayers to \nchallenge levies before the IRS seized their property, \nthat somehow shows that the Tax Court has jurisdic-\ntion only if a levy is pending. But that argument \ncannot trump plain text. And in any event, \u00a7 6330\u2019s \nhistory and purpose confirm that Congress wanted \nthe Tax Court to retain jurisdiction over a live unpaid \ntax or liability dispute even if the IRS no longer needs \na levy. \nCongress enacted \u00a7 6330 to protect taxpayers from \nthe IRS\u2019s abusive collection practices and to rein in the \nIRS\u2019s unchecked power to act as \u201cjudge, jury, and exe-\ncutioner, answerable to none.\u201d Hearings Before the \nCommittee on Finance at 56, 82; see supra pp. 9-10. \nAnd in designing \u00a7 6330\u2019s scheme, Congress sought to \n\u201censure that all taxpayers have due process and that \nthe IRS does not abusively use its liens-and-seizure \nauthority.\u201d 143 Cong. Rec. S12231 (statement of Sen. \nRoth). Indeed, the point of \u00a7 6330 proceedings is to \u201cin-\ncrease fairness to taxpayers\u201d before the IRS deprives \nthem of their property. S. Rep. No. 105-174, at 67; ac-\ncord Katz v. Commissioner, 115 T.C. 329, 333 n.8 \n(2000) (explaining that Congress enacted \u00a7 6330 \u201cto \nprovide new protections for taxpayers\u201d). \nSection 6330 did just that. It gave taxpayers a \nchance to challenge their liability before paying it \n\n37 \n \n \nwhen the taxpayer did not already have an oppor-\ntunity to challenge the liability, and ensured \ntaxpayers may always raise \u201cany relevant issue relat-\ning to the unpaid tax.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2). Section \n6330 thus gave taxpayers an opportunity for IRS Ap-\npeals to reach a \u201cdetermination\u201d on their unpaid tax \nor liability, and granted taxpayers the right \u201cto peti-\ntion the Tax Court to contest the Appeals [Office\u2019s] \ndecision,\u201d 144 Cong. Rec. S4494 (statement of Sen. \nHatch). Put simply, history shows that Congress did \nnot intend to enable the IRS to unilaterally deprive \nthe Tax Court of jurisdiction to review unpaid tax or \nliability disputes by finding another way to take the \ntaxpayer\u2019s money and then claiming it no longer seeks \nthe levy. And given \u00a7 6330\u2019s history, the Court should \nconstrue the statute \u201cbroadly to effectuate its pur-\nposes.\u201d Tcherepnin v. Knight, 389 U.S. 332, 336 (1967); \nsee Piedmont & Northern Railway. v. Interstate Com-\nmerce Commission, 286 U.S. 299, 311 (1932). \n3. Royal \nCanin \ndoesn\u2019t \nhelp \nthe \ngovernment. \nPointing to this Court\u2019s decision in Royal Canin, \nthe government argues that \u00a7 6330 contains a contin-\nuing-levy requirement because the IRS \u201calter[s]\u201d \n\u201c[t]he fundamental basis\u201d of the suit when it decides \nto no longer seek the levy. Br. 29-31. That argument \nfails. \nIn Royal Canin, the Court held that, if a plaintiff \namends her complaint to \u201celiminate[] the federal-law \nclaims that enabled removal, leaving only state-law \nclaims behind, the court\u2019s power to decide the dispute \ndissolves.\u201d 604 U.S. at 30. That makes sense, given the \nbasic idea that \u201c[i]f a plaintiff amends her complaint, \nthe new pleading \u2018supersedes\u2019 the old one.\u201d Id. at 35 \n\n38 \n \n \n(citing 6 Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice \nand Procedure \u00a7 1476 (3d ed. 2010)). And in Royal \nCanin, the plaintiff altered the basis for the federal \ncourt\u2019s federal question jurisdiction by amending her \ncomplaint to withdraw her federal claims.  \nNone of those principles shows that the Tax Court \nlost jurisdiction under \u00a7 6330 to review the Appeals \nOffice\u2019s determination when the IRS stopped pursuing \nthe levy. The basis of the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction un-\nder \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1) \nis \nthe \nAppeals \nOffice\u2019s \ndetermination\u2014not the proposed levy. The IRS did \nnot change the basis of the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction by \ndropping the levy, because once the Appeals Office is-\nsues a \u201cdetermination,\u201d the Tax Court has jurisdiction \nto review it. See I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1) (\u201cthe Tax Court \nshall have jurisdiction\u201d to \u201creview\u201d the \u201cdetermina-\ntion\u201d). And unlike the plaintiff in Royal Canin, Zuch \ndidn\u2019t file an amended pleading changing the basis of \nthe Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction. When Zuch filed her Tax \nCourt petition, she challenged the Appeals Office\u2019s de-\ntermination that she was not entitled to the estimated \npayments. That\u2019s still her challenge today, and the \nIRS\u2019s decision to stop pursuing the levy is irrelevant.  \nBut even assuming the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction \nunder \u00a7 6330 was somehow contingent on a levy, time-\nof-filing rules show that any levy requirement was \nmet because there was a pending levy when Zuch pe-\ntitioned the Tax Court. Time-of-filing rules generally \nprovide that jurisdiction \u201cdepends upon the state of \nthings at the time\u201d the plaintiff brings the action, \nGrupo Dataflux v. Atlas Global Group, L.P., 541 U.S. \n567, 570 (2004); see, e.g., Conolly v. Taylor, 27 U.S. (2 \nPet.) 556, 565 (1829)\u2014here, when the taxpayer peti-\ntions the Tax Court. So, if \u00a7 6330 did require a pending \nlevy, that levy requirement would be assessed at the \n\n39 \n \n \ntime the taxpayer files her Tax Court petition. And \nhere, there was a pending levy when Zuch petitioned \nthe Tax Court. Pet. App. 11a, 13a. The IRS\u2019s decision \nto stop pursuing the levy thus does not destroy the Tax \nCourt\u2019s jurisdiction to review the Appeals Office\u2019s de-\ntermination, even if \u00a7 6330 contains a levy-based \njurisdictional requirement. \n4. The government\u2019s policy argument is \nmeritless. \nThe government claims that, if it cannot deprive \nthe Tax Court of jurisdiction to review a liability chal-\nlenge by no longer seeking the levy, \u00a7 6330 will turn \ninto a \u201cgeneral forum for considering challenges to tax \nliability.\u201d Br. 24. That argument lacks merit. \nThere\u2019s no risk of the Tax Court wading into gen-\neral liability determinations in \u00a7 6330 proceedings. \nSection 6330 specifies the issues taxpayers may raise \nin \ncollection \ndue \nprocess \nhearings. \nI.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A). And only taxpayers who did not have \nan earlier opportunity to challenge their assessed lia-\nbility can challenge that claimed liability in collection \ndue process proceedings. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B). The \nTax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to review the taxpayer\u2019s lia-\nbility (or issue relating to the unpaid tax), in turn, is \ntied to the Appeals Office\u2019s liability determination. \nI.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). The sky isn\u2019t falling, and the gov-\nernment hasn\u2019t pointed to any \u00a7 6330 cases pending \nbefore the Appeals Office or the Tax Court that would \nsuggest otherwise. \nWhat\u2019s more, the question presented in this case \narises rarely, and when it does, it\u2019s only as a result of \n\u201cthe IRS\u2019s own recalcitrance.\u201d Boechler, 596 U.S. at \n207. The question arises only when the IRS initiates a \nlevy, but during \u00a7 6330 proceedings, finds a way to \n\n40 \n \n \ntake the taxpayer\u2019s money another way, and drops the \nlevy during the Tax Court\u2019s review. But there\u2019s no rea-\nson to think the issue comes up with any frequency. \nB. The Tax Court\u2019s authority is not limited \nto approving or rejecting a proposed \nlevy, but includes the power to issue \nbinding judgments. \nThe government argues that the Tax Court \ndoesn\u2019t have the power to declare Zuch\u2019s entitlement \nto the estimated payments. In the government\u2019s view, \n\u00a7 6330 doesn\u2019t authorize that relief, the DJA\u2019s prohi-\nbition on declaratory relief in most tax cases bars \nbinding relief here, and \u00a7 6330 is a \u201climited mecha-\nnism\u201d for either allowing or disallowing a levy. Br. 23-\n24, 27-29. Those arguments are meritless. \nFirst, \u00a7 6330(d)(1) authorizes the Tax Court to de-\ntermine whether the estimated payments should have \ncovered the amount the IRS assessed for the 2010 tax \nyear, no matter whether there is a pending levy. \nThat\u2019s because the Tax Court \u201cshall have jurisdiction\u201d \nto \u201creview\u201d the Appeals Office\u2019s determination of the \ntaxpayer\u2019s underlying liability or issues relating to \nher unpaid tax. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B), (d)(1). And that \nmeans the Tax Court can issue a ruling resolving \nZuch\u2019s liability or issues relating to the unpaid tax. \nThe IRS is expected to abide by that ruling, and in-\ndeed, that ruling will have preclusive effect. Supra \npp. 28-31. \nSecond, \u00a7 6330(e)(1) confirms that the Tax Court \ncan issue its ruling in the form of declaratory relief. \nThat provision authorizes injunctive relief in \u00a7 6330 \nproceedings, which necessarily means it also author-\nizes declaratory relief. That\u2019s because an injunction \nnecessarily rests on a declaration. Indeed, an \n\n41 \n \n \ninjunction prohibiting an act incorporates \u201ca judicial \ndeclaration that [the act] is illegal,\u201d Pet. App. 36a. \nAnd as this Court has recognized, declaratory relief is \na \u201cmilder\u201d alternative to an injunction. Steffel v. \nThompson, 415 U.S. 452, 466-67 (1974). Thus, the Tax \nCourt\u2019s authority to issue an injunction under \n\u00a7 6330(e)(1) includes the authority to issue declara-\ntory relief. \nResisting that conclusion, the government asserts \nthat \u00a7 6330(e)(1) can\u2019t authorize declaratory relief be-\ncause it limits injunctive authority to \u201ca specific \ncollection action.\u201d Br. 28-29. Not so. Section 6330(e)(1) \nauthorizes the Tax Court to enjoin \u201cany action or pro-\nceeding\u201d if: (1) \u201ca timely appeal has been filed under \nsubsection (d)(1),\u201d and (2) the injunction is \u201cin respect \nof the unpaid tax or proposed levy to which the deter-\nmination being appealed relates.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(e)(1); \nsee I.R.C. \u00a7 7421(a). And if the Tax Court can issue an \ninjunction \u201cin respect of the unpaid tax or proposed \nlevy,\u201d it can also decide the taxpayer\u2019s liability that \ngave rise to both the unpaid tax and the proposed levy.  \nThird, the DJA doesn\u2019t withdraw the Tax Court\u2019s \nauthority to issue declaratory relief. That statute au-\nthorizes federal courts to \u201cdeclare the rights and other \nlegal relations of any interested party seeking such \ndeclaration,\u201d \u201cexcept with respect to Federal taxes.\u201d 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2201(a). But courts have uniformly held that \nthe DJA must be read together with the Tax Code and \nthe AIA, I.R.C. \u00a7 7421(a). And that means the DJA \ndoes not prohibit declaratory relief where those other \nprovisions permit injunctions. E.g., Cohen v. United \nStates, 650 F.3d 717, 727-28 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (en banc); \nCIC Services, LLC v. Internal Revenue Service, 925 \nF.3d 247, 250 n.3 (6th Cir. 2019), rev\u2019d on other \ngrounds 593 U.S. 209 (2021); see Bob Jones University \n\n42 \n \n \nv. Simon, 416 U.S. 725, 732 n.7 (1974). Both the plain \ntext of \u00a7 6330(d)(1) and (e)(1) and the AIA, I.R.C. \n\u00a7 7421(a), authorize injunctions in \u00a7 6330 proceed-\nings, so declaratory relief is authorized as well. \nFinally, as explained (at 32-35), \u00a7 6330 isn\u2019t just \nabout whether a levy can proceed or not, so the Tax \nCourt\u2019s authority is not limited to deciding whether or \nnot a levy can proceed, either. Instead, Congress en-\nacted \u00a7 6330 to create a meaningful exception to what \nthe government says is the Tax Code\u2019s historical \u201cpay \nnow, dispute later\u201d framework. See Pet. Br. 2. It did so \nby allowing taxpayers to challenge the unpaid tax and \ntheir liability before they decide to pay or the IRS lev-\nies their property. And as \u00a7 6330\u2019s history confirms, \nthe Tax Court retains jurisdiction under \u00a7 6330 to re-\nview the Appeals Office\u2019s determination of her unpaid \ntax or tax liability, so it can issue binding relief resolv-\ning those issues, too. Supra pp. 23-24, 36-37. \nC. The government\u2019s claim that the parties \nlack a legally cognizable interest in the \ncase once the IRS decides not to move \nforward with the levy is incorrect. \nUnable to show that its actions deprived the Tax \nCourt of \u00a7 6330 jurisdiction, the IRS next contends \n(Br. 21), that the case is moot because once the IRS \ndecides it doesn\u2019t need a levy, the parties lack a legally \ncognizable interest. That is so, the IRS says, because \neven if \u201cthe IRS has made an error or continues to owe \n[the taxpayer] money,\u201d there\u2019s no threatened levy, and \nthe levy is \u201cthe issue that prompted\u201d the collection due \nprocess hearing. Id. That argument fails. \nThe question isn\u2019t whether \u201cthe issue that \nprompted\u201d a collection due process hearing is live. Ra-\nther, \u201c[a]s long as the parties have a concrete interest, \n\n43 \n \n \nhowever small, in the outcome of the litigation,\u201d the \ncase is not moot. Campbell-Ewald Co., 577 U.S. at \n161. And as explained, Zuch has a concrete interest in \nthe outcome of the litigation because the Tax Court \ncan adjudicate her unpaid tax or underlying liability \nby determining her right to the estimated payments, \nand therefore to a refund. Accord Saltzman & Book, \nsupra, \u00a7 14B.16[4][a]. That ruling would also be pre-\nclusive in the refund action Zuch has brought in the \nDistrict of New Jersey under I.R.C. \u00a7 7422. The IRS \nhas a concrete interest, too: if the Tax Court decides \nthat Zuch is not entitled to the estimated payments, \nthe IRS keeps her money. It is thus not \u201cimpossible for \na court to grant any effectual relief what[so]ever\u201d to \nwhomever prevails. Chafin v. Chafin, 568 U.S. 165, \n172 (2013). \nD. Whether Zuch\u2019s challenge is a dispute \nabout an unpaid tax or underlying \nliability is immaterial. \nIn a footnote, the government claims that Zuch\u2019s \nchallenge presents \u201can issue relating to [her] unpaid \ntax,\u201d rather than her tax liability. Br. 25 n.3. But, as \nthe government concedes, whether Zuch\u2019s challenge is \nabout an unpaid tax or underlying liability is immate-\nrial. Id. (\u201cThe Court need not \u2026 decide this dispute to \nresolve the question presented.\u201d). The difference \ndoesn\u2019t matter because, as explained (at 26-27), even \nif Zuch\u2019s challenge is one related to an \u201cunpaid tax,\u201d \nthe Tax Court still had jurisdiction. That\u2019s because \nZuch\u2019s challenge to her unpaid tax would still have \nbeen part of the Appeals Office\u2019s \u201cdetermination\u201d that \nwas reviewable by the Tax Court. Id. \nIn any event, the Appeals Office itself considered \nZuch to be challenging her underlying tax liability. \n\n44 \n \n \nPet. App. 48a, 66a. Indeed, she disputed whether she \nowed \u201cthe amounts that the Commissioner assessed \nfor [the 2010] tax period,\u201d Jeffers, 992 F.3d at 653 n.4, \nbecause she argued the estimated payments should \nhave been applied to her, see Peoplease, 2025 WL \n429626, at *2. Supra p. 26. And, in the IRS\u2019s own view, \n\u201cunpaid tax\u201d is just the unpaid portion of the \u201cunder-\nlying tax liability\u201d anyway.

App. 44a-49a, 50a-\n60a) are unreported. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nMarch 22, 2024.  A petition for rehearing was denied on \nJune 26, 2024 (Pet. App. 68a-69a).  On September 12, \n2024, Justice Alito extended the time within which to \nfile a petition for a writ of certiorari to and including \nOctober 11, 2024, and the petition was filed on that date.  \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari was granted on Jan-\nuary 10, 2025.  The jurisdiction of this Court rests on 28 \nU.S.C. 1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent statutory provisions are reprinted in an \nappendix to this brief.  App., infra, 1a-9a.  \nINTRODUCTION \nThe federal tax system operates on a simple default \npremise: pay now, dispute later.  In 1998, Congress en-\nacted a narrow exception to that rule.  If the Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS) seeks to levy on\u2014that is, affirm-\natively seize and sell\u2014a taxpayer\u2019s property, the IRS \ngenerally must provide the taxpayer with pre-levy notice \nand an opportunity for a hearing before the IRS Indepen-\ndent Office of Appeals (Appeals Office).  26 U.S.C. 6330.  \nThe Appeals Office makes a \u201cdetermination\u201d whether the \nIRS may proceed with \u201cthe levy action[] which [is] the \nsubject of the requested hearing.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3) \nand (e)(1).  A taxpayer disappointed with the outcome \nof the pre-levy hearing may \u201cpetition the Tax Court for \nreview of such determination.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1).   \nThis case presents the question whether a Section \n6330 proceeding in the Tax Court becomes moot when \nthere is no longer a live controversy over the levy.  Here, \nthe IRS initially proposed a levy on respondent\u2019s prop-\nerty, and she initiated a Section 6330 proceeding for \npre-deprivation review.  But before the Tax Court\u2019s re-\nview concluded, the IRS determined that respondent\u2019s \nintervening, additional payments meant that she no long-\ner owed any additional tax, so the IRS no longer sought \nto collect by levying on her property.   \nThat development mooted the proceeding for pre-\nlevy review.  When the IRS has decided not to pursue its \nproposed levy, the taxpayer has already received \u201cthe \nvery relief [she] ostensibly sought\u201d by requesting a pre-\ndeprivation hearing.  Willson v. Commissioner, 805 \nF.3d 316, 321 (D.C. Cir. 2015).  The Tax Court can pro-\n\n3 \n \nvide no further relief, and the Section 6330 proceeding \nmust end.  \nThe text of Section 6330 makes clear that it provides \na narrow path for review of a proposed levy\u2014not a \nmeans to circumvent the usual methods of disputing a \ntaxpayer\u2019s liability.  The decision below thus erred in \nconcluding that the Tax Court could still address wheth-\ner respondent has any \u201cunderlying tax liability\u201d\u2014an is-\nsue that may be considered under 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B) \nwhen evaluating whether a proposed levy may proceed.  \nWhen there is no proposed levy to adjudicate, the ques-\ntion of tax liability ceases to be an \u201cunderlying\u201d one.  \nNor does the Tax Court have jurisdiction to issue de-\nclaratory relief separate from its ability to enjoin the \nproposed levy that is \u201cthe subject of the requested hear-\ning.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(1). \nThat there is no longer review under Section 6330 \ndoes not foreclose judicial review of the IRS\u2019s handling \nof respondent\u2019s taxes.  Rather, as respondent has al-\nready acknowledged (Br. in Opp. 2, 4, 13, 16, 25), she \ncan proceed under the general rule and dispute the as-\nsessment and collection of her taxes in a refund suit.  \nBecause the court of appeals\u2019 contrary decision thwarts \nCongress\u2019s distinction between that general rule and \nthe narrow exception for pre-levy review, this Court \nshould reverse. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal Background \n1. The traditional mechanism for a taxpayer to dis-\npute the assessment or collection of a federal tax is a \npost-payment suit for a refund.  See CIC Servs., LLC v. \nIRS, 593 U.S. 209, 212 (2021) (\u201c[A] person can typically \nchallenge a federal tax only after he pays it, by suing for \na refund.\u201d).  To bring a refund suit, a taxpayer must first \n\n4 \n \npay the tax and then request a refund from the IRS.   \n26 U.S.C. 6402(a), 6511; 26 C.F.R. 301.6402\u20132; Flora v. \nUnited States, 357 U.S. 63, 64-75 (1958), aff\u200a\u2019d on reh\u2019g, \n362 U.S. 145 (1960).  If the refund is denied, the tax-\npayer may sue to recover the disputed amount.  28 \nU.S.C. 1346(a)(1); see 26 U.S.C. 6532, 7422(a); 28 U.S.C. \n1491(a)(1); United States v. Clintwood Elkhorn Mining \nCo., 553 U.S. 1, 4 (2008); see also, e.g., G.M. Leasing \nCorp. v. United States, 429 U.S. 338, 352 n.18 (1977) \n(collecting cases for the proposition that post-payment \nreview of a tax liability comports with due process).  \nFor certain taxes, however, Congress has also pro-\nvided a pre-assessment avenue for judicial review.  Spe-\ncifically, for income, estate, gift, and various other \ntaxes, Congress has directed the IRS to issue a \u201cnotice \nof  * * *  deficiency\u201d to a taxpayer who has failed to re-\nport a tax properly.  26 U.S.C. 6212(a).  The taxpayer \nmay then file a petition for redetermination in the Tax \nCourt.  26 U.S.C. 6213.  With certain exceptions, the \nIRS may not attempt to collect the tax at issue before \nthe time for seeking judicial review has expired or while \nsuch review is pending.  26 U.S.C. 6213(a).  \nThe Internal Revenue Code and other statutes chan-\nnel judicial review of challenges to tax assessment and \ncollection to those prescribed mechanisms.  The Tax \nAnti-Injunction Act, 26 U.S.C. 7421(a), and the tax ex-\nception to the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. \n2201(a), generally preclude suits for injunctive and de-\nclaratory relief regarding the assessment or collection \nof taxes.  And 26 U.S.C. 7422(a) precludes suits to re-\ncover taxes alleged to have been assessed or collected \nunlawfully before a taxpayer has properly sought a re-\nfund from the IRS. \n\n5 \n \n2. Following assessment, if a taxpayer who is \u201cliable \nto pay any tax neglects or refuses to pay,\u201d the IRS may \ngenerally \u201ccollect such tax\u201d by \u201clevy[ing] upon\u201d the tax-\npayer\u2019s property, i.e., seizing and selling it.  26 U.S.C. \n6331(a); see 26 U.S.C. 6331(b) (defining \u201clevy\u201d to \u201cin-\nclude[] the power of distraint and seizure by any means,\u201d \nand permitting the sale of \u201csuch property or rights to \nproperty\u201d); see also 26 U.S.C. 6321 (providing for tax \nliens).  Certain types of property\u2014including, with some \nexceptions, residences, welfare and unemployment ben-\nefits, and particular pensions\u2014are exempt from levies.  \nSee 26 U.S.C. 6334. \nBefore 1998, the Internal Revenue Code authorized \nthe IRS to levy upon taxpayer property without any \nprior opportunity for a hearing or other pre-collection \nprocess, so long as adequate post-deprivation proce-\ndures were available.  See Phillips v. Commissioner, \n283 U.S. 589, 595 (1931); 26 U.S.C. 6331(d) (1994).  In \n1998, however, Congress established procedures that \nthe IRS generally must follow before levying.  See Tax-\npayer Bill of Rights 3 (Taxpayer Bill of Rights), Pub. L. \nNo. 105-206, Tit. III, \u00a7 3401(b), 112 Stat. 747-749 (26 \nU.S.C. 6330); see also id. \u00a7 3401(a), 112 Stat. 746-747 (26 \nU.S.C. 6320) (substantially similar framework for IRS \nfiling of a notice of federal tax lien).  \nThose procedures are codified in Section 6330 of the \nCode, which is entitled \u201c[n]otice and opportunity for \nhearing before levy.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330.  Under those pro-\ncedures, \u201c[n]o levy may be made\u201d unless the IRS pro-\nvides the taxpayer with 30 days\u2019 notice and the oppor-\ntunity to request a hearing.  26 U.S.C. 6330(a)(1); see 26 \nU.S.C. 6330(a)(2) and (3).   \nIf the taxpayer makes such a request, an administra-\ntive hearing to review the proposed levy\u2014sometimes \n\n6 \n \ncalled a \u201ccollection due process hearing,\u201d Boechler, P.C. \nv. Commissioner, 596 U.S. 199, 202 (2022)\u2014is con-\nducted by an impartial officer in the Appeals Office.  26 \nU.S.C. 6330(b).  The taxpayer\u2019s request for a hearing \nsuspends \u201cthe levy actions which are the subject of the \nrequested hearing\u201d as well as the running of specified \nlimitations periods.  26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(1).   \nAt the hearing, the taxpayer may raise \u201cany relevant \nissue relating to the unpaid tax or the proposed levy,\u201d \nincluding \u201cchallenges to the appropriateness of collec-\ntion actions\u201d and \u201coffers of collection alternatives.\u201d  26 \nU.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(A)(ii) and (iii); see 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(4) \n(excluding certain issues that were previously litigated \nor qualify as frivolous).  If the taxpayer \u201cdid not receive \nany statutory notice of deficiency for [the relevant] tax \nliability or did not otherwise have an opportunity to dis-\npute such tax liability,\u201d she also may raise \u201cchallenges \nto the existence or amount of the underlying tax liabil-\nity.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B). \nAt the conclusion of a Section 6330 hearing, the  \nAppeals Office issues its \u201cdetermination,\u201d 26 U.S.C. \n6330(c)(3), which is \u201ca written notice\u201d reflecting wheth-\ner \u201ccollection by way of levy may proceed.\u201d  Lunsford v. \nCommissioner, 117 T.C. 159, 164-165 (2001).  The Ap-\npeals Office reaches its determination after considering \nstatutorily delineated factors, including whether the re-\nquirements of applicable law or administrative proce-\ndure have been met, 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(1) and (3)(A); the \nissues raised by the taxpayer, 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2) and \n(3); and \u201cwhether any proposed collection action bal-\nances the need for the efficient collection of taxes with \nthe legitimate concern of the [taxpayer] that any collec-\ntion action be no more intrusive than necessary,\u201d 26 \nU.S.C. 6330(c)(3)(C).   \n\n7 \n \nA taxpayer who is dissatisfied with a determination \nsustaining a levy may petition the United States Tax \nCourt \u201cfor review of such determination (and the Tax \nCourt shall have jurisdiction with respect to such mat-\nter).\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1).  The Tax Court\u2019s decision, \nin turn, is subject to review by a federal court of ap-\npeals.  26 U.S.C. 7482(a)(1). \n3. Although a taxpayer\u2019s request for a Section 6330 \nhearing suspends \u201cthe levy actions which are the sub-\nject of the requested hearing\u201d and certain limitations \nperiods, 26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(1), other mechanisms for tax \ncollection may proceed.  Most relevant here, when a tax-\npayer overpays the tax owed for a particular year, the \nIRS \u201cmay credit the amount of such overpayment\u201d \nagainst \u201cany liability in respect of an internal revenue \ntax on the part of the person who made the overpay-\nment\u201d instead of refunding that amount to the taxpayer.  \n26 U.S.C. 6402(a).   \nThat application of overpayment credits\u2014sometimes \nreferred to as an \u201coffset\u201d\u2014is an administrative action \ndistinct from the collection of a tax by a levy or lien on \nthe taxpayer\u2019s property.  See Belloff v. Commissioner, \n996 F.2d 607, 616 (2d Cir. 1993); Boyd v. Commissioner, \n124 T.C. 296, 300 (2005); 26 C.F.R. 301.6330\u20131(g)(2),  \nQ & A-G3.  A taxpayer may challenge the application of \ncredits through the traditional mechanism for disputing \nthe collection of a federal tax: filing a refund claim with \nthe IRS and, if necessary, a refund suit.  See 26 U.S.C. \n7422(a) and (d). \nB. The Present Controversy \n1. From 1993 to 2014, respondent was married to \nPatrick Gennardo.  Pet. App. 7a.  This case concerns the \n2010 tax year, for which respondent and Gennardo ulti-\nmately filed separate tax returns.  Ibid.  \n\n8 \n \na. In 2010 and 2011, respondent and Gennardo made \ntwo estimated tax payments, totaling $50,000, to the \nIRS for tax year 2010.  Pet. App. 8a.  First, the couple \nsubmitted an estimated tax payment of $20,000.  Ibid.  \nThe accompanying Form 1040-ES identified both of \ntheir names, but it did not indicate that they would be \nfiling separate returns, and it provided no instructions \non how to allocate the payment between them.  C.A. \nApp. 274, 314.  Second, Gennardo submitted a $30,000 \nbank check, which identified only Gennardo as the re-\nmitter.  Pet. App. 8a; see C.A. App. 274, 315.  The sub-\nject line of the accompanying cover letter identified \nboth respondent and Gennardo, but neither the check \nnor any accompanying documentation instructed the \nIRS to allocate any part of that payment to respondent.  \nC.A. App. 275, 315, 633, 638. \nb. On September 12, 2012, the couple filed separate \n(and untimely) 2010 federal income-tax returns.  Pet. \nApp. 7a; see C.A. App. 316-381.  Respondent did not claim \nany of the $50,000 in estimated tax payments on her re-\nturn, while Gennardo claimed $10,000 in estimated tax \npayments on his return.  C.A. App. 317, 331. Respond-\nent\u2019s and Gennardo\u2019s tax returns were prepared by the \nsame tax preparer.  Id. at 277. \nOn the same day that they submitted their separate \ntax returns, Gennardo made a written compromise offer \nto the IRS about his outstanding federal tax liabilities \nfor tax years 2007 through 2011.  C.A. App. 278, 382.  \nAlthough the offer covered years in which respondent \nand Gennardo had filed joint tax returns, Gennardo\u2019s  \noffer-in-compromise did not include respond\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

App., infra, 1a-9a.  \nINTRODUCTION \nThe federal tax system operates on a simple default \npremise: pay now, dispute later.  In 1998, Congress en-\nacted a narrow exception to that rule.  If the Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS) seeks to levy on\u2014that is, affirm-\natively seize and sell\u2014a taxpayer\u2019s property, the IRS \ngenerally must provide the taxpayer with pre-levy notice \nand an opportunity for a hearing before the IRS Indepen-\ndent Office of Appeals (Appeals Office).  26 U.S.C. 6330.  \nThe Appeals Office makes a \u201cdetermination\u201d whether the \nIRS may proceed with \u201cthe levy action[] which [is] the \nsubject of the requested hearing.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3) \nand (e)(1).  A taxpayer disappointed with the outcome \nof the pre-levy hearing may \u201cpetition the Tax Court for \nreview of such determination.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1).   \nThis case presents the question whether a Section \n6330 proceeding in the Tax Court becomes moot when \nthere is no longer a live controversy over the levy.  Here, \nthe IRS initially proposed a levy on respondent\u2019s prop-\nerty, and she initiated a Section 6330 proceeding for \npre-deprivation review.  But before the Tax Court\u2019s re-\nview concluded, the IRS determined that respondent\u2019s \nintervening, additional payments meant that she no long-\ner owed any additional tax, so the IRS no longer sought \nto collect by levying on her property.   \nThat development mooted the proceeding for pre-\nlevy review.  When the IRS has decided not to pursue its \nproposed levy, the taxpayer has already received \u201cthe \nvery relief [she] ostensibly sought\u201d by requesting a pre-\ndeprivation hearing.  Willson v. Commissioner, 805 \nF.3d 316, 321 (D.C. Cir. 2015).  The Tax Court can pro-\n\n3 \n \nvide no further relief, and the Section 6330 proceeding \nmust end.  \nThe text of Section 6330 makes clear that it provides \na narrow path for review of a proposed levy\u2014not a \nmeans to circumvent the usual methods of disputing a \ntaxpayer\u2019s liability.  The decision below thus erred in \nconcluding that the Tax Court could still address wheth-\ner respondent has any \u201cunderlying tax liability\u201d\u2014an is-\nsue that may be considered under 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B) \nwhen evaluating whether a proposed levy may proceed.  \nWhen there is no proposed levy to adjudicate, the ques-\ntion of tax liability ceases to be an \u201cunderlying\u201d one.  \nNor does the Tax Court have jurisdiction to issue de-\nclaratory relief separate from its ability to enjoin the \nproposed levy that is \u201cthe subject of the requested hear-\ning.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(1). \nThat there is no longer review under Section 6330 \ndoes not foreclose judicial review of the IRS\u2019s handling \nof respondent\u2019s taxes.  Rather, as respondent has al-\nready acknowledged (Br. in Opp. 2, 4, 13, 16, 25), she \ncan proceed under the general rule and dispute the as-\nsessment and collection of her taxes in a refund suit.  \nBecause the court of appeals\u2019 contrary decision thwarts \nCongress\u2019s distinction between that general rule and \nthe narrow exception for pre-levy review, this Court \nshould reverse. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal Background \n1. The traditional mechanism for a taxpayer to dis-\npute the assessment or collection of a federal tax is a \npost-payment suit for a refund.  See CIC Servs., LLC v. \nIRS, 593 U.S. 209, 212 (2021) (\u201c[A] person can typically \nchallenge a federal tax only after he pays it, by suing for \na refund.\u201d).  To bring a refund suit, a taxpayer must first \n\n4 \n \npay the tax and then request a refund from the IRS.   \n26 U.S.C. 6402(a), 6511; 26 C.F.R. 301.6402\u20132; Flora v. \nUnited States, 357 U.S. 63, 64-75 (1958), aff\u200a\u2019d on reh\u2019g, \n362 U.S. 145 (1960).  If the refund is denied, the tax-\npayer may sue to recover the disputed amount.  28 \nU.S.C. 1346(a)(1); see 26 U.S.C. 6532, 7422(a); 28 U.S.C. \n1491(a)(1); United States v. Clintwood Elkhorn Mining \nCo., 553 U.S. 1, 4 (2008); see also, e.g., G.M. Leasing \nCorp. v. United States, 429 U.S. 338, 352 n.18 (1977) \n(collecting cases for the proposition that post-payment \nreview of a tax liability comports with due process).  \nFor certain taxes, however, Congress has also pro-\nvided a pre-assessment avenue for judicial review.  Spe-\ncifically, for income, estate, gift, and various other \ntaxes, Congress has directed the IRS to issue a \u201cnotice \nof  * * *  deficiency\u201d to a taxpayer who has failed to re-\nport a tax properly.  26 U.S.C. 6212(a).  The taxpayer \nmay then file a petition for redetermination in the Tax \nCourt.  26 U.S.C. 6213.  With certain exceptions, the \nIRS may not attempt to collect the tax at issue before \nthe time for seeking judicial review has expired or while \nsuch review is pending.  26 U.S.C. 6213(a).  \nThe Internal Revenue Code and other statutes chan-\nnel judicial review of challenges to tax assessment and \ncollection to those prescribed mechanisms.  The Tax \nAnti-Injunction Act, 26 U.S.C. 7421(a), and the tax ex-\nception to the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. \n2201(a), generally preclude suits for injunctive and de-\nclaratory relief regarding the assessment or collection \nof taxes.  And 26 U.S.C. 7422(a) precludes suits to re-\ncover taxes alleged to have been assessed or collected \nunlawfully before a taxpayer has properly sought a re-\nfund from the IRS. \n\n5 \n \n2. Following assessment, if a taxpayer who is \u201cliable \nto pay any tax neglects or refuses to pay,\u201d the IRS may \ngenerally \u201ccollect such tax\u201d by \u201clevy[ing] upon\u201d the tax-\npayer\u2019s property, i.e., seizing and selling it.  26 U.S.C. \n6331(a); see 26 U.S.C. 6331(b) (defining \u201clevy\u201d to \u201cin-\nclude[] the power of distraint and seizure by any means,\u201d \nand permitting the sale of \u201csuch property or rights to \nproperty\u201d); see also 26 U.S.C. 6321 (providing for tax \nliens).  Certain types of property\u2014including, with some \nexceptions, residences, welfare and unemployment ben-\nefits, and particular pensions\u2014are exempt from levies.  \nSee 26 U.S.C. 6334. \nBefore 1998, the Internal Revenue Code authorized \nthe IRS to levy upon taxpayer property without any \nprior opportunity for a hearing or other pre-collection \nprocess, so long as adequate post-deprivation proce-\ndures were available.  See Phillips v. Commissioner, \n283 U.S. 589, 595 (1931); 26 U.S.C. 6331(d) (1994).  In \n1998, however, Congress established procedures that \nthe IRS generally must follow before levying.  See Tax-\npayer Bill of Rights 3 (Taxpayer Bill of Rights), Pub. L. \nNo. 105-206, Tit. III, \u00a7 3401(b), 112 Stat. 747-749 (26 \nU.S.C. 6330); see also id. \u00a7 3401(a), 112 Stat. 746-747 (26 \nU.S.C. 6320) (substantially similar framework for IRS \nfiling of a notice of federal tax lien).  \nThose procedures are codified in Section 6330 of the \nCode, which is entitled \u201c[n]otice and opportunity for \nhearing before levy.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330.  Under those pro-\ncedures, \u201c[n]o levy may be made\u201d unless the IRS pro-\nvides the taxpayer with 30 days\u2019 notice and the oppor-\ntunity to request a hearing.  26 U.S.C. 6330(a)(1); see 26 \nU.S.C. 6330(a)(2) and (3).   \nIf the taxpayer makes such a request, an administra-\ntive hearing to review the proposed levy\u2014sometimes \n\n6 \n \ncalled a \u201ccollection due process hearing,\u201d Boechler, P.C. \nv. Commissioner, 596 U.S. 199, 202 (2022)\u2014is con-\nducted by an impartial officer in the Appeals Office.  26 \nU.S.C. 6330(b).  The taxpayer\u2019s request for a hearing \nsuspends \u201cthe levy actions which are the subject of the \nrequested hearing\u201d as well as the running of specified \nlimitations periods.  26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(1).   \nAt the hearing, the taxpayer may raise \u201cany relevant \nissue relating to the unpaid tax or the proposed levy,\u201d \nincluding \u201cchallenges to the appropriateness of collec-\ntion actions\u201d and \u201coffers of collection alternatives.\u201d  26 \nU.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(A)(ii) and (iii); see 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(4) \n(excluding certain issues that were previously litigated \nor qualify as frivolous).  If the taxpayer \u201cdid not receive \nany statutory notice of deficiency for [the relevant] tax \nliability or did not otherwise have an opportunity to dis-\npute such tax liability,\u201d she also may raise \u201cchallenges \nto the existence or amount of the underlying tax liabil-\nity.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B). \nAt the conclusion of a Section 6330 hearing, the  \nAppeals Office issues its \u201cdetermination,\u201d 26 U.S.C. \n6330(c)(3), which is \u201ca written notice\u201d reflecting wheth-\ner \u201ccollection by way of levy may proceed.\u201d  Lunsford v. \nCommissioner, 117 T.C. 159, 164-165 (2001).  The Ap-\npeals Office reaches its determination after considering \nstatutorily delineated factors, including whether the re-\nquirements of applicable law or administrative proce-\ndure have been met, 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(1) and (3)(A); the \nissues raised by the taxpayer, 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2) and \n(3); and \u201cwhether any proposed collection action bal-\nances the need for the efficient collection of taxes with \nthe legitimate concern of the [taxpayer] that any collec-\ntion action be no more intrusive than necessary,\u201d 26 \nU.S.C. 6330(c)(3)(C).   \n\n7 \n \nA taxpayer who is dissatisfied with a determination \nsustaining a levy may petition the United States Tax \nCourt \u201cfor review of such determination (and the Tax \nCourt shall have jurisdiction with respect to such mat-\nter).\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1).  The Tax Court\u2019s decision, \nin turn, is subject to review by a federal court of ap-\npeals.  26 U.S.C. 7482(a)(1). \n3. Although a taxpayer\u2019s request for a Section 6330 \nhearing suspends \u201cthe levy actions which are the sub-\nject of the requested hearing\u201d and certain limitations \nperiods, 26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(1), other mechanisms for tax \ncollection may proceed.  Most relevant here, when a tax-\npayer overpays the tax owed for a particular year, the \nIRS \u201cmay credit the amount of such overpayment\u201d \nagainst \u201cany liability in respect of an internal revenue \ntax on the part of the person who made the overpay-\nment\u201d instead of refunding that amount to the taxpayer.  \n26 U.S.C. 6402(a).   \nThat application of overpayment credits\u2014sometimes \nreferred to as an \u201coffset\u201d\u2014is an administrative action \ndistinct from the collection of a tax by a levy or lien on \nthe taxpayer\u2019s property.  See Belloff v. Commissioner, \n996 F.2d 607, 616 (2d Cir. 1993); Boyd v. Commissioner, \n124 T.C. 296, 300 (2005); 26 C.F.R. 301.6330\u20131(g)(2),  \nQ & A-G3.  A taxpayer may challenge the application of \ncredits through the traditional mechanism for disputing \nthe collection of a federal tax: filing a refund claim with \nthe IRS and, if necessary, a refund suit.  See 26 U.S.C. \n7422(a) and (d). \nB. The Present Controversy \n1. From 1993 to 2014, respondent was married to \nPatrick Gennardo.  Pet. App. 7a.  This case concerns the \n2010 tax year, for which respondent and Gennardo ulti-\nmately filed separate tax returns.  Ibid.  \n\n8 \n \na. In 2010 and 2011, respondent and Gennardo made \ntwo estimated tax payments, totaling $50,000, to the \nIRS for tax year 2010.  Pet. App. 8a.  First, the couple \nsubmitted an estimated tax payment of $20,000.  Ibid.  \nThe accompanying Form 1040-ES identified both of \ntheir names, but it did not indicate that they would be \nfiling separate returns, and it provided no instructions \non how to allocate the payment between them.  C.A. \nApp. 274, 314.  Second, Gennardo submitted a $30,000 \nbank check, which identified only Gennardo as the re-\nmitter.  Pet. App. 8a; see C.A. App. 274, 315.  The sub-\nject line of the accompanying cover letter identified \nboth respondent and Gennardo, but neither the check \nnor any accompanying documentation instructed the \nIRS to allocate any part of that payment to respondent.  \nC.A. App. 275, 315, 633, 638. \nb. On September 12, 2012, the couple filed separate \n(and untimely) 2010 federal income-tax returns.  Pet. \nApp. 7a; see C.A. App. 316-381.  Respondent did not claim \nany of the $50,000 in estimated tax payments on her re-\nturn, while Gennardo claimed $10,000 in estimated tax \npayments on his return.  C.A. App. 317, 331. Respond-\nent\u2019s and Gennardo\u2019s tax returns were prepared by the \nsame tax preparer.  Id. at 277. \nOn the same day that they submitted their separate \ntax returns, Gennardo made a written compromise offer \nto the IRS about his outstanding federal tax liabilities \nfor tax years 2007 through 2011.  C.A. App. 278, 382.  \nAlthough the offer covered years in which respondent \nand Gennardo had filed joint tax returns, Gennardo\u2019s  \noffer-in-compromise did not include respondent.  C.A. \nApp. 386.  Consistent with the terms of the offer and \nIRS rules governing payments related to pending of-\nfers, the IRS applied the full $50,000 in estimated tax \n\n9 \n \npayments to Gennardo\u2019s separate account.  Pet. App. \n8a; see C.A. App. 277-279, 310, 384, 466, 468, 473, 662; \nI.R.S. Notice 2006-68, 2006-31 I.R.B. 105.   \nc. In November 2012, respondent filed an amended \nreturn for the 2010 tax year showing that she owed an \nadditional $27,682.  Pet. App. 9a; see C.A. App. 279, 475, \n477.  For the first time, respondent\u2019s amended return \nalso claimed for herself the full $50,000 in estimated tax \npayments, yielding a claimed overpayment of $21,918 \nfor the 2010 tax year.  Pet. App. 9a; see C.A. App. 280, \n475.  Because the IRS had already allocated the $50,000 \nto Gennardo, it declined to apply the estimated pay-\nments to respondent\u2019s account.  C.A. App. 280.  Instead, \nthe IRS assessed the tax that respondent had reported \non her amended return, along with interest and a late-\nfiling penalty of $7020.  Ibid.   \n2. a. In 2013, the IRS sent respondent a notice and \ndemand for payment of her balance due.  C.A. App. 280.  \nRespondent failed to pay, and the IRS sent her a notice \nof its intent to levy on her property to collect the unpaid \ntaxes.  Pet. App. 70a-75a; C.A. App. 571-573.   \nRespondent invoked her right under Section 6330 to \nchallenge the proposed levy in a hearing before the Ap-\npeals Office.  Pet. App. 10a; C.A. App. 567-570.  She con-\ntended that the IRS should have applied the full $50,000 \nin estimated tax payments to her account, which would \nhave satisfied her self-reported underlying tax liability \nand resulted in a refund.  Pet. App. 10a; C.A. App. 567.   \nIn 2014, after a hearing, the Appeals Office issued a \ndetermination sustaining the IRS\u2019s proposed levy, ex-\nplaining that the estimated tax payments could not be \napplied to respondent\u2019s account because they had been \ncredited to Gennardo\u2019s account.  Pet. App. 61a-67a.  Re-\nspondent petitioned the Tax Court for review, and in \n\n10 \n \n2016, the Tax Court remanded to the Appeals Office for \nclarification of several issues.  C.A. App. 16; Pet. App. \n50a-60a.  On remand, the Appeals Office reaffirmed its \nprior determination to sustain the proposed levy, ex-\nplaining in a 2017 supplemental notice of determination \nthat the estimated tax payments had been properly al-\nlocated to Gennardo.  Pet. App. 44a-49a. \nb. While respondent\u2019s pre-levy proceedings were \npending before the Appeals Office and the Tax Court, \nrespondent overpaid her taxes for 2013 and subsequent \ntax years.  Pet. App. 12a-13a.  The IRS exercised its au-\nthority under Section 6402(a) to credit her overpay-\nments in those years against her 2010 tax liability.  Ibid.  \nBy April 15, 2019, the credits transferred from later tax \nyears had reduced the balance due on respondent\u2019s 2010 \nliability to $0.  Id. at 13a. \nIn March 2020, the IRS moved to dismiss as moot the \npre-levy proceeding before the Tax Court, explaining \nthat respondent\u2019s 2010 tax liability had been satisfied \nand the IRS therefore \u201cno longer intend[ed] to pursue \nthe proposed collection action.\u201d  Pet. App. 42a; see C.A. \nDoc. 5-4, at 450 (July 21, 2022) (motion to dismiss).   \nThe Tax Court granted the motion and dismissed the \ncase.  Pet. App. 40a-43a.  The court explained that the \n\u201ccase is moot\u201d \u201c[b]ecause there is no unpaid liability for \nthe determination year upon which a levy could be \nbased, and [the IRS] is no longer pursuing the proposed \ncollection action.\u201d  Id. at 43a (citing McLane v. Commis-\nsioner, 24 F.4th 316 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 143 S. Ct. \n408 (2022); Greene-Thapedi v. Commissioner, 126 T.C. \n1, 7 (2006)).  The court acknowledged that respondent \ncontinued to argue that the IRS should have credited \nthe estimated payments to her, but the court reasoned \nthat because it did not \u201chave jurisdiction to determine \n\n11 \n \nan overpayment or to order a refund or credit of tax \npaid in a section 6330 proceeding, this is not the proper \nforum to determine whether, and the extent to which, if \nany, the underlying liability has been overpaid.\u201d  Ibid.  \nThe court observed that respondent could still \u201cpursue \nany refund to which she might be entitled through tra-\nditional Federal income procedures, including if neces-\nsary, initiating a case in a different Federal court.\u201d  \nIbid. \n3. The court of appeals vacated the Tax Court\u2019s or-\nder of dismissal and remanded for the Tax Court to de-\ntermine whether respondent was entitled to the esti-\nmated tax payments that the IRS had allocated to Gen-\nnardo.  Pet. App. 1a-39a.   \nAlthough the court of appeals acknowledged that \n\u201cthe Tax Court need not hear a moot case,\u201d Pet. App. \n16a, the court of appeals held that the proceedings be-\nfore the Tax Court are \u201cnot moot,\u201d id. at 2a.  In a part \nof the opinion joined by only two members of the panel, \nthe court of appeals concluded that the Tax Court has \njurisdiction in a Section 6330 pre-levy proceeding to re-\nview a taxpayer\u2019s \u201cunderlying tax liability,\u201d id. at 26a \n(quoting 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B)), and that the statute \ndoes not \u201csuggest that a taxpayer\u2019s right to challenge \nthe existence or amount of her underlying tax becomes \nmoot once the levy is no longer being enforced or the \ntax is satisfied,\u201d id. at 26a-27a.  The court of appeals \nreasoned that even though the IRS is no longer seeking \nto take respondent\u2019s property by levy, the Tax Court \nretains jurisdiction to \u201cdeclare that [respondent] had a \nright to the estimated payments.\u201d  Id. at 37a.  The court \nof appeals acknowledged that its holding is contrary to \nthose of the Fourth and D.C. Circuits, which have held \nthat a Section 6330 proceeding in the Tax Court is moot \n\n12 \n \nwhen the IRS no longer seeks to levy on a taxpayer\u2019s \nproperty.  Id. at 27a (citing McLane, 24 F.4th at 319 (4th \nCir.); Willson v. Commissioner, 805 F.3d 316, 321 (D.C. \nCir. 2015)).   \nIn a part of the opinion joined by all three members \nof the panel, the court of appeals alternatively con-\ncluded that the case is not moot on the theory that the \nTax Court has jurisdiction to determine whether the \nIRS validly exercised its authority under Section 6402 \nto use respondent\u2019s later-year overpayments to offset \nher 2010 tax liability.  Pet. App. 19a-25a.  Respondent \nhad made only a passing reference to the validity of the \noffsets in her reply brief, see Resp. C.A. Reply Br. 16-\n17, but after oral argument, the court of appeals ap-\npointed an amicus to address the question (along with \nsix other issues), C.A. Doc. 45 (June 1, 2023).   \nIn holding that the Tax Court may review the appli-\ncation of credits under Section 6402, the court of ap-\npeals relied on \u201can implicit grant\u201d of jurisdiction, ob-\nserving that \u201c[i]t may be that Congress has not explic-\nitly granted the Tax Court such power.\u201d  Pet. App. 20a.  \nSpecifically, the court of appeals reasoned that Section \n6402 \u201ccarries forward the common law of setoffs,\u201d which \nmeans that the Tax Court has implicit jurisdiction to re-\nview the application of credits in a pre-levy proceeding, \neven absent a proposed levy.  Id. at 21a.1   \nThe court of appeals then considered the application \nof Section 6402 credits to respondent\u2019s 2010 tax liability \nin the first instance.  Even though Section 6402 allows \n \n1  Although the court of appeals used the terms \u201coffset\u201d and \u201cset-\noff\u200a\u201d interchangeably, the statute uses \u201coffset\u201d to refer to an over-\npayment credit, see 26 U.S.C. 6402, while \u201csetoff\u200a\u201d is typically used \nto describe the common-law principle, see, e.g., United States v. \nMunsey Trust Co., 332 U.S. 234, 239 (1947). \n\n13 \n \nthe application of credits to \u201cany liability,\u201d 26 U.S.C. \n6402(a), the court determined that the offset was \u201cinva-\nlid and without legal effect\u201d because common-law setoff \nprinciples do not apply to disputed debts, Pet. App. 25a.  \nHaving concluded that respondent\u2019s \u201ctax obligation was \nnot properly set off,\u201d the court determined that her tax \nliability remains, and she may \u201cchallenge the IRS\u2019s ap-\nplication of the estimated payments\u201d in a Section 6330 \nproceeding.  Id. at 19a.   \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nA pre-levy proceeding under 26 U.S.C. 6330 is moot \nwhen there is no longer a live dispute over the proposed \nlevy that gave rise to the proceeding. \nA. The Tax Court is a court of limited jurisdiction, \ncapable of exercising only the jurisdiction expressly \nconferred on it by Congress.  The Tax Court has been \ngranted jurisdiction over a \u201cpetition  * * *  for review\u201d \nof the Appeals Office\u2019s \u201cdetermination\u201d whether a par-\nticular levy may proceed.  26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1).  When \nthe IRS no longer seeks to proceed by levy\u2014such that \nthere is no live dispute over \u201cthe levy action[] which  \n[is] the subject of the requested hearing,\u201d 26 U.S.C. \n6330(e)(1)\u2014the taxpayer\u2019s challenge is moot, and the \nTax Court lacks jurisdiction to resolve it. \nAt every step in the Section 6330 process, the statu-\ntory text squarely focuses on the question whether a \nlevy may go forward.  The statute mandates that the \ntaxpayer receive notice and an opportunity for a hear-\ning \u201cbefore levy\u201d; it requires that certain levy-related \ninformation be conveyed in the notice; and it instructs \nthat the Appeals Office\u2019s \u201cdetermination\u201d must \u201ctake \ninto consideration,\u201d inter alia, \u201cwhether any proposed \ncollection action balances the need for the efficient col-\nlection of taxes with the legitimate concern of the per-\n\n14 \n \nson that any collection action be no more intrusive than \nnecessary.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(a) and (c)(3)(C).  Once the \nAppeals Office determines whether the levy may pro-\nceed, Section 6330 authorizes the Tax Court to review \n\u201csuch determination.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1).  But where \nthere is no longer a live dispute over a levy, there is \nnothing left for the Tax Court to do, and the case is \nmoot. \nB. That understanding is consistent with Section \n6330\u2019s history and its role in the Internal Revenue Code.  \nCongress enacted Section 6330 to ensure that taxpayers \nhave a pre-deprivation opportunity to contest levies.  \nSection 6330 was not designed to, and did not, provide a \nbroader means for taxpayers to dispute their tax liabil-\nity untethered from proposed levies. \nC. The court of appeals\u2019 and respondent\u2019s contrary \narguments lack merit.  Both the court and respondent \nhave suggested that the Tax Court retains jurisdiction \nabsent a live dispute over a levy because, in some cir-\ncumstances, Section 6330(c)(2)(B) permits a taxpayer to \nraise at a pre-levy hearing \u201cchallenges to the existence \nor amount of the underlying tax liability.\u201d  26 U.S.C. \n6330(c)(2)(B); see Pet. App. 19a; Br. in Opp. 14.  But, as \nthat text underscores, a taxpayer\u2019s \u201cunderlying tax lia-\nbility\u201d must underlie the proposed collection action\u2014\nthat is, the levy.  The statute thus does not support treat-\ning a taxpayer\u2019s challenge to her \u201cunderlying tax liabil-\nity\u201d as providing a freestanding basis for Tax Court ju-\nrisdiction.  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B).  Rather, where Sec-\ntion 6330(c)(2)(B) applies, it simply supplies one \u201ccon-\nsideration\u201d that the Appeals Office must \u201ctake into\u201d ac-\ncount when issuing the \u201cdetermination\u201d whether the \nproposed levy may proceed.  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B) and \n(3).  When there is no live dispute over a proposed levy, \n\n15 \n \nthere is no Tax Court jurisdiction to address the \u201cun-\nderlying\u201d question.  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B). \nThe court of appeals alternatively held that the Tax \nCourt has \u201cimplicit\u201d jurisdiction to review the IRS\u2019s al-\nlocation of respondent\u2019s later-year overpayments to off-\nset her tax liability.  Pet. App. 20a.  Respondent has not \ndefended that rationale in this Court, and for good rea-\nson.  Congress must expressly provide for Tax Court \njurisdiction by statute, and no statute grants that court \nauthority to review Section 6402 credits in a Section \n6330 proceeding.  Even if the Tax Court could conduct \nsuch review, it still could not provide meaningful relief. \nD. This case is moot.  When respondent failed to pay \nher self-reported 2010 tax debt, the IRS proposed to \ncollect her liability by administrative levy.  Respondent \nthen invoked her right to a pre-levy proceeding under \nSection 6330.  But while that proceeding was ongoing, \nrespondent overpaid her taxes for subsequent tax \nyears, and the IRS used its authority under Section \n6402 to credit those overpayments against respondent\u2019s \n2010 tax debt.  With no debt remaining, the IRS aban-\ndoned the levy that was \u201cthe subject of the requested \nhearing,\u201d 26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(1).  The Tax Court therefore \nlacked jurisdiction to review the Appeals Office\u2019s \u201cde-\ntermination\u201d that the levy could proceed.  26 U.S.C. \n6330(d)(1).   \nThat does not, however, leave respondent without a \njudicial remedy:  She may dispute the IRS\u2019s allocation \nof the 2010 estimated payments and her subsequent \noverpayments in a refund suit, the traditional mecha-\nnism for such challenges (and the one that she could \nhave used if the IRS had never proposed a levy).  But \nabsent a live dispute over a potential levy, Section 6330 \nhas no role to play. \n\n16 \n \nARGUMENT \nA PRE-LEVY PROCEEDING UNDER 26 U.S.C. 6330 IS MOOT \nWHEN THERE IS NO LONGER A LIVE DISPUTE OVER THE \nPROPOSED LEVY THAT GAVE RISE TO THE PROCEEDING \nThe court of appeals held that a pre-levy proceeding \nunder 26 U.S.C. 6330 may continue even when there is \nno longer a live dispute over the proposed levy that gave \nrise to the proceeding.  Pet. App. 16a-39a.  That holding \nis incorrect.  Section 6330 is narrowly trained on the ap-\npropriateness of a proposed levy.  When the parties no \nlonger dispute the propriety of such a levy, the proceed-\ning becomes moot.  This Court should reverse. \nA. The Text Of Section 6330 Makes Clear That A Pre-Levy \nProceeding Is Moot When The IRS No Longer Seeks To \nLevy On A Taxpayer\u2019s Property \n1. The United States Tax Court is \u201ca court of limited \njurisdiction.\u201d  Commissioner v. McCoy, 484 U.S. 3, 7 (1987) \n(per curiam).  It may exercise \u201conly the power \u2018expressly \nconferred by Congress.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. 14a (quoting Sunoco \nInc. v. Commissioner, 663 F.3d 181, 187 (3d Cir. 2011)); \nsee 26 U.S.C. 7442; see, e.g., Commissioner v. Gooch \nMilling & Elevator Co., 320 U.S. 418, 422 (1943) (dis-\ncussing the Tax Court\u2019s predecessor, the Board of Tax \nAppeals).  \u201cThus, if a case raises a question within the \njurisdictional purview of the tax court, and that ques-\ntion is subsequently resolved, the case is moot\u201d\u2014and \nthe Tax Court lacks jurisdiction\u2014\u201cnotwithstanding the \nexistence of other live controversies between the tax-\npayer and the IRS that do not fall within the tax court\u2019s \njurisdiction.\u201d  Willson v. Commissioner, 805 F.3d 316, \n320 (D.C. Cir. 2015). \nHere, it is undisputed that the relevant jurisdiction-\nconferring provision is 26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1).  See Pet. 8; \nBr. in Opp. 14; see also Pet. App. 14a.  Section 6330 pro-\n\n17 \n \nvides a mechanism for \u201cthe taxpayer [to] challenge [a] \nlevy or offer collection alternatives\u201d before a seizure of \nthe taxpayer\u2019s property occurs.  Boechler, P.C. v. Com-\nmissioner, 596 U.S. 199, 202 (2022).  That procedure\u2014\nalong with the similar one for tax liens, 26 U.S.C. 6320\u2014\nis only necessary when the IRS is attempting to use a \nlien or levy to enforce collection of a tax liability.  If the \nIRS\u2019s Appeals Office issues a \u201cdetermination\u201d that the \nproposed levy may proceed, Section 6330(d)(1) grants \nthe Tax Court \u201cjurisdiction\u201d over the taxpayer\u2019s peti-\ntion for review of \u201csuch determination.\u201d  26 U.S.C. \n6330(d)(1); see 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3).   \nThe entire point of the Section 6330 proceeding is to \ndetermine whether the IRS may go forward with its \nproposed levy.  Thus, at every step, the statutory text is \nnarrowly focused on that question.  Congress supplied \nthe title for the section:  \u201cNotice and opportunity for \nhearing before levy.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330; Taxpayer Bill of \nRights \u00a7 3401(b), 112 Stat. 747.  Section 6330(a)(1) di-\nrectly ties the right to a hearing to the proposed levy, \nproviding that \u201c[n]o levy may be made on any property \nor right to property of any person unless the Secretary \nhas notified such person in writing of their right to a \nhearing under this section before such levy is made.\u201d  26 \nU.S.C. 6330(a)(1); see Greene-Thapedi v. Commissioner, \n126 T.C. 1, 6, 8 (2006).  Notice of the proposed levy must \nbe given \u201cnot less than 30 days before the day of the \nfirst levy,\u201d and it must include a variety of levy-related \ninformation, including \u201cthe proposed action\u201d; \u201cthe pro-\nvisions of [Title 26] relating to levy and sale of prop-\nerty\u201d; \u201cthe procedures applicable to the levy and sale of \nproperty under [Title 26]\u201d; \u201cthe administrative appeals \navailable to the taxpayer with respect to such levy and \nsale\u201d; \u201cthe alternatives available to taxpayers which \n\n18 \n \ncould prevent levy on property\u201d; and \u201cthe provisions of \n[Title 26] and procedures relating to redemption of \nproperty and release of liens on property.\u201d  26 U.S.C. \n6330(a)(2) and (3)(C).  The exceptions to Section 6330 \nalso reflect its focus on levies.  The pre-levy procedure \nis unavailable if the Secretary finds that \u201cthe collection \nof tax is in jeopardy,\u201d or if the case concerns certain lev-\nies imposed on States, \u201cdisqualified employment tax \nlev[ies],\u201d or \u201cFederal contractor lev[ies].\u201d  26 U.S.C. \n6330(f\u200a).  In those instances, \u201cthe taxpayer shall be given \nthe opportunity for the hearing described in [Section \n6330] within a reasonable period of time after the levy.\u201d  \nIbid.   \nIf no exception applies and the taxpayer invokes her \nstatutory right to a pre-levy hearing, \u201cthe levy actions \nwhich are the subject of the requested hearing\u201d and cer-\ntain limitations periods \u201cshall be suspended for the pe-\nriod during which such hearing, and appeals therein, are \npending.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(1); see 26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(2) \n(providing an exception to this rule).  Because the levy \nis the \u201csubject of the requested hearing,\u201d ibid., it would \nmake little sense for the action to continue once the IRS \nno longer seeks to enforce the levy.  \nThe outcome of the \u201cCollection Due Process\u201d or \n\u201cCDP hearing\u201d under Section 6330 is a \u201c\u200a\u2018determination\u2019 \nregarding the legitimacy of the proposed levy.\u201d  Will-\nson, 805 F.3d 318, 320 (quoting 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3)); \nsee McLane v. Commissioner, 24 F.4th 316, 318-319 \n(4th Cir.), cert. denied, 143 S. Ct. 408 (2022) (explaining \nthat \u201cthe Appeals Office determines in the first instance \nwhether the IRS\u2019s collection action may go forward\u201d).  \nAt the hearing, the taxpayer may raise \u201cany relevant \nissue relating to the unpaid tax or the proposed levy,\u201d \nincluding \u201cappropriate spousal defenses,\u201d \u201cchallenges to \n\n19 \n \nthe appropriateness of collection actions,\u201d and \u201coffers of \ncollection alternatives.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(A).  The \nAppeals Office\u2019s \u201c\u200adetermination,\u201d in turn, \u201cshall take \ninto consideration  * * *  whether any proposed collec-\ntion action balances the need for the efficient collection \nof taxes with the legitimate concern of the person that \nany collection action be no more intrusive than neces-\nsary.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3)(C).   \nIn certain cases where the taxpayer has not previ-\nously had the opportunity to dispute her tax liability, \nthe taxpayer may also raise \u201cchallenges to the existence \nor amount of the underlying tax liability.\u201d  26 U.S.C. \n6330(c)(2)(B).  But like the other issues that the tax-\npayer may raise, such challenges to the taxpayer\u2019s un-\nderlying liability are simply \u201cconsideration[s]\u201d that feed \ninto the ultimate \u201cdetermination\u201d whether the levy may \nproceed.  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3)(C).   \nIn this case, for example, the Notice of Determina-\ntion that the Appeals Office sent respondent recounted \nthe Appeals Office\u2019s \u201cdetermination  * * *  that the pro-\nposed levy  * * *  balances the need for efficient collec-\ntion of taxes with [respondent\u2019s] legitimate concern that \nany collection action be no more intrusive than neces-\nsary.\u201d  Pet. App. 63a.  And it stated that \u201cthe Final No-\ntice of [I]ntent to Levy [was therefore] being sus-\ntained.\u201d  Ibid.; see id. at 64a (\u201cAppeals has determined \nto sustain the action (levy).\u201d). \n2. The statutory focus on the appropriateness of a \nproposed levy follows the case to the Tax Court.  Section \n6330(d)(1) provides that \u201cwithin 30 days of a determina-\ntion under this section\u201d\u2014that is, a determination \nwhether the levy may go forward\u2014the taxpayer may \n\u201cpetition the Tax Court for review of such determina-\ntion.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1).  And crucially, the statute \n\n20 \n \nvests the Tax Court with \u201cjurisdiction with respect to \nsuch matter,\u201d ibid.\u2014i.e., the \u201cpetition for review of [the \nAppeals Office\u2019s] determination.\u201d  Boechler, 596 U.S. at \n204; see, e.g., Lunsford v. Commissioner, 117 T.C. 159, \n164 (2001) (explaining that the Tax Court\u2019s \u201cjurisdiction  \n* * *  is established when there is a written notice that \nembodies a determination to proceed with the collection \nof the taxes in issue, and a timely filed petition\u201d there-\nfrom).  Thus, the Tax Court proceedings\u2014like the ear-\nlier Appeals Office proceedings\u2014are squarely focused \non whether the IRS may enforce a proposed levy. \n3. Once the IRS has determined that it is no longer \nseeking to levy on the taxpayer\u2019s property, there is \nnothing left for the Tax Court to do.  Such a decision not \nto pursue a levy is \u201cthe very relief [the taxpayer] osten-\nsibly sought when [she] requested a [Section 6330] \nhearing to challenge the proposed levy in the first \nplace,\u201d and it is \u201call the relief that section 6330 author-\nizes the tax court to grant.\u201d  Willson, 805 F.3d at 321.  \nSection 6330(e)(1) provides that if a taxpayer requests \na hearing, \u201cthe levy actions which are the subject of the \nrequested hearing  * * *  shall be suspended\u201d during the \npendency of the hearing and any appeals.  26 U.S.C. \n6330(e)(1).  The statute further states that \u201c[n]otwith-\nstanding the provisions of section 7421(a)\u201d\u2014the Tax \nAnti-Injunction Act\u2014\u201cthe beginning of a levy or pro-\nceeding during\u201d that period of suspension \u201cmay be en-\njoined by a proceeding in the proper court, including the \nTax Court\u201d if an appeal to the Tax Court is timely filed.  \nIbid.  But the timely appeal triggers Tax Court jurisdic-\ntion to enjoin other actions \u201conly in respect of the un-\npaid tax or proposed levy to which the determination \nbeing appealed relates.\u201d  Ibid.  And that power ceases \nto matter when the IRS has already decided not to pur-\n\n21 \n \nsue the proposed levy because it is satisfied that the tax \nhas been paid. \nThus, when the IRS determines that it no longer \nneeds or intends to take the taxpayer\u2019s property by \nlevy, the pre-levy proceeding becomes moot.  That is \ntrue whether the liability has been \u201cabated,\u201d see Will-\nson, 805 F.3d at 320 (IRS ceased pursuing levy based on \nincorrect assessment); Byers v. Commissioner, 740 \nF.3d 668, 679 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (similar); or has been sat-\nisfied with other taxpayer funds, see McLane, 24 F.4th \nat 319; Greene-Thapedi, 126 T.C. at 7.   \nAnd the proceeding remains moot regardless of \nwhether the taxpayer contends that the IRS has made \nan error or continues to owe her money.  See Willson, \n805 F.3d at 320; McLane, 24 F.4th at 319 n.*; Greene-\nThapedi, 126 T.C. at 7.  The taxpayer may make those \narguments in a post-deprivation suit for a refund\u2014the \ntraditional mechanism for disputing the assessment or \ncollection of a federal tax.  See 26 U.S.C. 7422(a); 28 \nU.S.C. 1346(a)(1), 1491(a)(1).  But the Section 6330 pro-\nceeding is a rare pre-deprivation mechanism for chal-\nlenging a particular method of a collection: a proposed \nlevy.  Once the IRS no longer seeks to deprive the tax-\npayer of any property by levy, the issue that prompted \nthe Section 6330 proceeding is no longer \u201c\u200a\u2018live,\u2019\u200a\u201d and the \nparties have ceased to have any \u201clegally cognizable in-\nterest\u201d in a determination regarding the permissibility \nof the levy.  Chafin v. Chafin, 568 U.S. 165, 172 (2013) \n(citation omitted).2   \n \n2 Although it is not organized under Article III, the Tax Court has \nconcluded that \u201c[t]he case or controversy requirement under Article \nIII \u2018presumptively\u2019 applies in the Tax Court.\u201d  Pet. App. 15a (quot-\ning Battat v. Commissioner, 148 T.C. 32, 46 (2017)).  This Court \nneed not determine whether the Tax Court\u2019s understanding is cor-\n\n22 \n \nB. Section 6330\u2019s History And Function Within The Inter-\nnal Revenue Code Confirm That A Pre-levy Proceeding \nBecomes Moot When There Is No Longer A Live Dispute \nOver A Proposed Levy  \n1. As discussed above, the default means for a tax-\npayer to dispute the assessment or collection of a federal \ntax is a post-payment refund suit.  See pp. 3-4, supra.  Be-\nfore 1998, the Internal Revenue Code authorized the \nIRS to levy upon taxpayer property without any prior \nopportunity for a hearing or other pre-collection pro-\ncess, so long as the taxpayer was given 30 days\u2019 notice.  \nSee 26 U.S.C. 6331(d) (1994); see, e.g., Iames v. Com-\nmissioner, 850 F.3d 160, 165 (4th Cir. 2017) (describing \n\u201cthe Commissioner\u2019s significant and previously unfet-\ntered power to levy\u201d).   \nThat changed in 1998, when Congress enacted \u201ca \nprocedural protection for taxpayers to oppose IRS col-\nlection actions\u201d before they occurred.  Jeffers v. Com-\nmissioner, 992 F.3d 649, 655 (7th Cir. 2021).  In making \nthat change, Congress\u2019s \u201cgeneral focus\u201d was \u201con the \nCommissioner\u2019s collection of a predetermined liability.\u201d  \n \nrect.  Regardless of whether Article III constraints apply, \u201cthe con-\ntroversy must also fall within the [Tax Court\u2019s] statutory grant of \njurisdiction.\u201d  Willson, 805 F.3d at 320.  And once the IRS has de-\ntermined that it will not pursue a levy, the Tax Court lacks statutory \njurisdiction over a Section 6330 proceeding.  This Court may resolve \nthe question presented on that basis.  See Sinochem Int\u2019l Co. v. Ma-\nlaysia Int\u2019l Shipping Corp., 549 U.S. 422, 430-431 (2007).    \n In any event, assuming that Article III principles do apply, the \ncase is moot.  Respondent has no live interest in contesting a with-\ndrawn levy, and the only relief that the Tax Court could provide\u2014a \ndetermination that the levy could not go forward, and an injunction \nagainst it\u2014would not constitute \u201ceffectual relief,\u201d Campbell-Ewald \nCo. v. Gomez, 577 U.S. 153, 161 (2016) (citation omitted), after the \nproposed levy has already been withdrawn.   \n\n23 \n \nIames, 850 F.3d at 165.  That is, Congress designed Sec-\ntion 6330 to review a proposed levy, not to provide a \nmore general opportunity for a taxpayer to challenge an \nassessment of tax. \nThe pre-levy procedures in Section 6330 were under-\nstood as \u201cestablish[ing] formal procedures designed to \ninsure due process where the IRS seeks to collect taxes \nby levy.\u201d  S. Rep. No. 174, 105th Cong., 2d Sess. 67 (1998); \nsee ibid. (\u201c[T]he Committee believes that the IRS \nshould afford taxpayers adequate notice of collection ac-\ntivity and a meaningful hearing before the IRS deprives \nthem of their property.\u201d); see also H.R. Rep. No. 599, \n105th Cong., 2d Sess. 263 (1998) (describing the new \nprovision in similar terms).  \u201c[T]he entire purpose be-\nhind the creation of [Section 6330] was to provide tax-\npayers with greater due process to contest the IRS\u2019s \nlevy and sale of their property.\u201d  Zapara v. Commis-\nsioner, 652 F.3d 1042, 1045 (9th Cir. 2011).  Nothing in \nthe history of the provision suggests that Congress in-\ntended for the pre-levy proceeding to continue where \nthere is no longer a live dispute over a proposed levy. \n2. That understanding of Section 6330 is consistent \nwith its important but limited function within the Inter-\nnal Revenue Code.  Challenges to the assessment of a \ntax are generally the province of post-payment refund \nsuits, and in the case of certain taxes, pre-payment de-\nficiency actions.  See pp. 3-4, supra.  The Internal Rev-\nenue Code and other statutes protect that principle \nthrough provisions like the Tax Anti-Injunction Act, 26 \nU.S.C. 7421(a), and the tax exception to the Declaratory \nJudgment Act, 28 U.S.C. 2201(a), which generally pre-\nclude suits for injunctive and declaratory relief regard-\ning the assessment or collection of taxes.  Understood \nagainst that backdrop, Section 6330 is a limited mecha-\n\n24 \n \nnism to ensure that a taxpayer may \u201cchallenge a levy \nbefore seizure and sale,\u201d Pet. App. 4a\u2014not an addi-\ntional avenue to seek relief in the absence of a live dis-\npute over a levy.   \nThere are tens of thousands of Section 6330 proceed-\nings each year.  See Treasury Inspector Gen. for Tax \nAdmin., U.S. Dep\u2019t of the Treasury, Report No. 2023-\n10-038, Review of the IRS Independent Office of Ap-\npeals Collection Due Process Program 7 (July 2023), \nperma.cc/DVL7-9HA8 (reporting 28,349 closed Section \n6330 cases in 2023).  Allowing those proceedings to con-\ntinue even when the IRS no longer seeks to levy on a \ntaxpayer\u2019s property could convert many of them from a \nlimited opportunity for pre-deprivation review into a \nmore general forum for considering challenges to tax li-\nability.  Nothing in the text or history of Section 6330 \nsupports that end-run around the calibrated statutory \nframework that generally provides for post-payment \nadjudication of disputes over tax liability. \nC. The Contrary Arguments Offered By Respondent And \nThe Court Of Appeals Lack Merit \nThe court of appeals recognized that \u201cthe Tax Court \nneed not hear a moot case.\u201d  Pet. App. 16a.  But the \ncourt held that a pre-levy proceeding under Section \n6330 does not become moot when the IRS \u201cwithdr[aws] \nits levy.\u201d  Id. at 25a.  That was error, and neither the \ncourt of appeals nor respondent has offered any persua-\nsive support for the court\u2019s holding. \n1. The Tax Court lacks jurisdiction to consider a tax-\npayer\u2019s \u201cunderlying tax liability\u201d when there is no \nlive dispute over a proposed levy \na. In a portion of its opinion joined by only two mem-\nbers of the panel, the court of appeals held that the Sec-\n\n25 \n \ntion 6330 proceeding in this case is not moot because re-\nspondent still disputes whether the IRS \u201cerroneously \nallocated\u201d the estimated payments to Gennardo rather \nthan respondent.  Pet. App. 19a.  The court relied on \nSection 6330(c)(2)(B), which, in certain circumstances, \nallows a taxpayer to raise at a Section 6330 hearing \u201cthe \nexistence or amount of the underlying tax liability.\u201d  26 \nU.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B).  Respondent likewise contends \n(Br. in Opp. 14) that the Tax Court may \u201cresolve any \ndispute about the taxpayer\u2019s underlying tax liability \nthat the taxpayer properly raised before the Appeals \nOffice\u201d\u2014even if the IRS no longer seeks to enforce the \nlevy that gave rise to the Section 6330 proceeding.3 \nThat argument ignores the text and context of Sec-\ntion 6330(c)(2)(B).  That provision comes into play \n \n3 The parties have disagreed about which subsection of Section \n6330 governs respondent\u2019s challenge to the IRS\u2019s allocation of  \nestimated payments.  See Pet. Reply Br. 4 n.2.  While respondent \nrelies on Section 6330(c)(2)(B)\u2019s reference to \u201cchallenges to the ex-\nistence or amount of the underlying tax liability,\u201d id. at 4, the gov-\nernment disputes that characterization because the liability  \nitself\u2014respondent\u2019s self-reported 2010 tax\u2014is not in question.  \nSee Gov\u2019t C.A. Supp. Br. 24-25.  Because respondent claims that the \nagreed-upon liability should have been paid through the estimated \npayments, the government views that argument as an \u201cissue relat-\ning to the unpaid tax.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(A); see Melasky v. Com-\nmissioner, 151 T.C. 89, 92 (2018) (\u201cA question about whether the \nIRS properly credited a payment is not a challenge to a tax liability; \ni.e., the amount of tax imposed by the Code for a particular year.  It \nis instead a question of whether the liability remains unpaid.\u201d).  The \nCourt need not, however, decide this dispute to resolve the question \npresented.  As discussed in the text, even under respondent\u2019s char-\nacterization, the Section 6330 proceeding in this case is moot be-\ncause a taxpayer may challenge her \u201cunderlying tax liability\u201d only \nin connection with a determination whether a proposed levy may \nproceed. \n\n26 \n \nwhere the taxpayer seeks to dispute an \u201cunderlying tax \nliability.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B).  For a \u201cliability\u201d to \nexist, the taxpayer must still owe a debt to the IRS.  See \nWebster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary of the \nEnglish Language 1302 (1993) (Webster\u2019s Third) (defin-\ning \u201cliability\u201d as \u201can amount that is owed whether pay-\nable in money, other property, or services\u201d); see also \nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary 1095 (12th ed. 2024) (defining \n\u201cliability\u201d as \u201c[a] financial or pecuniary obligation in a \nspecificed amount; DEBT <tax liability>\u201d).   \nCrucially, for a taxpayer\u2019s liability to be \u201cunderly-\ning,\u201d it must be \u201clying under or beneath,\u201d \u201cbe at the ba-\nsis of,\u201d or \u201cform the foundation of\u200a\u201d something else.  \nWebster\u2019s Third 2489 (definitions of \u201cunderlying\u201d and \n\u201cunderlie\u201d).  In the context of Section 6330, the tax lia-\nbility is \u201cunderlying\u201d the proposed \u201clevy actions which \nare the subject of the requested hearing.\u201d  26 U.S.C. \n6330(c)(2)(B) and (e)(1).  When there is not a proposed \nlevy, any dispute about tax liability ceases to be the \nfoundation for something else.  There is accordingly no \n\u201cunderlying tax liability\u201d for purposes of 26 U.S.C. \n6330(c)(2)(B). \nAs the Fourth Circuit has correctly explained, the \nphrase \u201cunderlying tax liability\u201d must be understood in \n\u201cthe specific context in which that language is used,\u201d \nand in Section 6330, \u201cthe \u2018specific context\u2019 is the IRS\u2019s \nattempt to collect via lien or levy.\u201d  McLane, 24 F.4th at \n319 (quoting Yates v. United States, 574 U.S. 528, 537 \n(2015)).  Where Section 6330(c)(2)(B) applies, a tax-\npayer may challenge the existence or amount of her \n\u201cunderlying tax liability,\u201d 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B)\u2014just \nas she may raise \u201cany relevant issue relating to the un-\npaid tax,\u201d 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(A).  But those challenges \nare available for purposes of informing the determina-\n\n27 \n \ntion whether the proposed levy may proceed.  The stat-\nute therefore requires the Appeals Office to \u201ctake\u201d \nthose factors \u201cinto consideration\u201d in making its \u201cdeter-\nmination\u201d about the levy.  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3).  And the \nTax Court will in turn review \u201csuch determination\u201d on \nappeal.  26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1).  If the Tax Court con-\ncludes that a taxpayer owes less than the IRS has cal-\nculated, that conclusion will affect the propriety of the \nproposed collection action because the IRS cannot col-\nlect more than is owed.    \nBut that is the extent of the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction \nunder Section 6330.  Section 6330 does not identify a \nchallenge to the taxpayer\u2019s \u201cunderlying tax liability\u201d as \na freestanding issue.  When the IRS is not seeking a levy, \nthere is no underlying liability, and Section 6330(c)(2)(B) \nhas no role to play.  In that instance, the taxpayer can-\nnot use a Section 6330 proceeding as an \u201cindependent \nbasis to challenge the existence or amount\u201d of her tax \ndebt, Greene-Thapedi, 126 T.C. at 8\u2014just as she could \nnot have used Section 6330 to seek such findings if no \nlevy had been proposed in the first place.  See McLane, \n24 F.4th at 319; Willson, 805 F.3d at 320-321; Byers, 740 \nF.3d at 679.   \nb. Echoing the court of appeals (Pet. App. 33a-36a), \nrespondent has suggested (Br. in Opp. 19) that her case \nis not moot because the Tax Court \u201chad authority to is-\nsue declaratory relief as to [her] underlying liability.\u201d  \nBut even where declaratory relief is generally available, \nit \u201cdoes not \u2018extend\u2019 the \u2018jurisdiction\u2019 of the federal \ncourts.\u201d  Medtronic, Inc. v. Mirowski Family Ventures, \nLLC, 571 U.S. 191, 197 (2014) (quoting Skelly Oil Co. v. \nPhillips Petroleum Co., 339 U.S. 667, 671 (1950)).  And \nhere, the Tax Court lacks the authority to provide the \ndeclaration that respondent seeks. \n\n28 \n \nCongress has granted only limited powers of declar-\natory relief with respect to federal taxes.  The Declara-\ntory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. 2201(a), bars declaratory \njudgments \u201cwith respect to Federal taxes other than ac-\ntions brought under section 7428 of the Internal Reve-\nnue Code of 1986.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2201(a); see ibid. (excluding \ncertain bankruptcy and duty-related proceedings).  Sec-\ntion 7428 grants authority to issue declaratory judgments, \nbut only with respect to tax-exempt status.  26 U.S.C. \n7428(a)(1) and (2).  Congress has also authorized the Tax \nCourt to issue declaratory relief in certain other con-\ntexts.  See 26 U.S.C. 7476-7479.  But none of those pro-\nvisions authorizes the Tax Court to issue declaratory \njudgments in a levy-review proceeding under Section \n6330.   \nRespondent contends (Br. in Opp. 23) that because \nSection 6330(e)(1) \u201cauthorizes\u201d the Tax Court to order \n\u201cinjunctive relief,\u201d it \u201cnecessarily * * *  authorizes de-\nclaratory relief\u200a\u201d as well.  See Pet. App. 35a-36a.  But \nrespondent\u2019s reasoning fails on its own terms.  Where \nthe IRS no longer seeks to enforce a levy, the court has \nno power to enjoin a levy under Section 6330(e).  See, \ne.g., Willson, 805 F.3d at 321.  Respondent therefore \ncannot bootstrap from the Tax Court\u2019s authority to is-\nsue an injunction the \u201cmilder\u201d authority to issue a de-\nclaratory judgment.  Br. in Opp. 23 (quoting Steffel v. \nThompson, 415 U.S. 452, 466-467 (1974)). \nMore generally, Section 6330(e)(1)\u2019s limited grant of \nauthority to enjoin a specific collection action during a \nlevy-review proceeding does not provide for Tax Court \njurisdiction over any administrative action other than \nthe proposed levy that is \u201cthe subject of the requested \nhearing.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(1).  That provision simply \nprovides courts with an enforcement mechanism to pre-\n\n29 \n \nvent the use of a particular administrative collection \ntool\u2014an administrative levy to collect a specific under-\nlying liability\u2014while the taxpayer is provided the op-\nportunity to mount a pre-deprivation challenge to that \nlevy.  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(A) and (e). \nReading the exception in Section 6330(e) to open the \ndoor to more general declaratory and injunctive relief \nwould be at odds with Congress\u2019s determination, as a \ngeneral rule, to \u201cpermit the United States to assess and \ncollect taxes alleged to be due without judicial interven-\ntion, and to require that the legal right to the disputed \nsums be determined in a suit for refund.\u201d  Enochs v. \nWilliams Packing & Navigation Co., 370 U.S. 1, 7 \n(1962) (citing 26 U.S.C. 7421(a)); see, e.g., Phillips v. \nCommissioner, 283 U.S. 589, 595-597 (1931).  Congress\u2019s \ndecision to suspend certain collection procedures while \nlevy-review proceedings are pending\u2014and to authorize \nthe Tax Court to enforce that suspension\u2014did not cre-\nate additional exceptions to the general rule.4 \nc. Respondent suggests that the Tax Court\u2019s limited \npre-deprivation jurisdiction survives the IRS\u2019s aban-\n \n4 The court of appeals declined to decide whether the Tax Court \nhas \u201coverpayment or refund jurisdiction in a context like this,\u201d Pet. \nApp. 34a n.38, and respondent has not raised that issue in this Court, \nsee Br. in Opp. 21.  There is no general grant of refund jurisdiction \nin the Tax Court.  See, e.g., United States ex rel. Girard Trust Co. \nv. Helvering, 301 U.S. 540, 542 (1937) (addressing the Tax Court\u2019s \npredecessor); Empire Ordinance Corp. v. Harrington, 249 F.2d \n680, 682 (D.C. Cir. 1957).  And while Congress has given the Tax \nCourt jurisdiction to determine an overpayment or refund in certain \nspecific proceedings, see 26 U.S.C. 6015(e) and (g), 6213, 6214(a), \n6404(h), 6512(b), it has not done so with respect to pre-levy chal-\nlenges under Section 6330, see, e.g., Brown v. Commissioner, 58 \nF.4th 1064, 1066-1067 (9th Cir. 2023); McLane, 24 F.4th at 319; Will-\nson, 805 F.3d at 321; Greene-Thapedi, 126 T.C. at 8, 12-13. \n\n30 \n \ndonment of its proposed levy because, in other contexts, \n\u201cjurisdiction \u2018depend[s] upon the state of things at the \ntime of the action brought.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Br. in Opp. 16 (quoting \nGrupo Dataflux v. Atlas Global Grp., L.P., 541 U.S. 567, \n570 (2004)).  But as the cases that respondent cites make \nclear, \u201cthat principle is not absolute.\u201d  Coba v. Ford Mo-\ntor Co., 932 F.3d 114, 119 (3d Cir. 2019).  Most \u201cnotably, \nwhere a case becomes moot in the course of the litiga-\ntion,\u201d a court cannot continue to adjudicate it.  Cun-\nningham Charter Corp. v. LearJet, Inc., 592 F.3d 805, \n810 (7th Cir. 2010).  That is the case here:  Section 6330 \nprovides the Tax Court with jurisdiction to review a \n\u201cdetermination\u201d whether a proposed levy may proceed.  \n26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3) and (d)(1).  When there is no longer \nany need for such a determination, there is no need for \nreview of such a determination, and the Section 6330 \nproceeding is moot. \nEven outside of mootness scenarios, this Court has \nrecognized that a court may be deprived of subject- \nmatter jurisdiction by developments that fundamen-\ntally alter the basis for a lawsuit, such as \u201cthe with-\ndrawal of [the original] allegations\u201d on which jurisdic-\ntion was based.  Rockwell Int\u2019l Corp. v. United States, \n549 U.S. 457, 473 (2007).  The Court recently applied \nthat principle in Royal Canin U.S.A., Inc. v. Wull-\nschleger, 604 U.S. 22 (2025).  There, the plaintiff filed a \ncomplaint in state court containing both federal- and \nstate-law claims, and the defendant removed the case to \nfederal court, invoking federal-question jurisdiction \n(over the federal-law claims) and supplemental jurisdic-\ntion (over the state-law claims).  Id. at 28-29.  After the \nremoval, the plaintiff amended her complaint to remove \nthe federal claims.  Id. at 29.  This Court recognized \nthat, at that point, the \u201cchanges in claims\u201d had \u201ceffec-\n\n31 \n \ntively rema[d]e the suit.\u201d   Id. at 35.  Because there were \nno longer any federal-law claims to which the consider-\nation of state-law claims could be considered supple-\nmental, the district court had ceased to have any \u201csup-\nplemental jurisdiction at all.\u201d  Id. at 34. \nThe same logic applies here.  The fundamental basis \nfor a Section 6330 proceeding is the taxpayer\u2019s claim \nthat the IRS should not be allowed to collect a tax lia-\nbility via levy.  See C.A. App. 24 (respondent\u2019s petition \nfor review in the Tax Court sought review of the \u201cdeter-\nmination  * * *  reflected in [the] Notice of Determina-\ntion Concerning Collection Action[s]\u201d in her case, which \n\u201csustained the validity and appropriateness of a Final \nNotice of Intent to Levy\u201d).  Respondent\u2019s overpayments \nof taxes in subsequent years\u2014and the IRS\u2019s resulting \ndetermination that it \u201cno longer needs nor intends to \ncollect [respondent\u2019s] income tax liability\u201d via levy, C.A. \nDoc. 5-4, at 450\u2014effectively remade the suit, eliminat-\ning the need to determine whether the levy could pro-\nceed and hence any need to decide the underlying tax \nliability.  The Tax Court accordingly ceased to have ju-\nrisdiction under Section 6330.   \n2. The Tax Court has no \u201cimplicit\u201d jurisdiction to  \nreview offsets in a Section 6330 proceeding  \nThe court of appeals alternatively held that this case \nis not moot because the Tax Court could review the \nIRS\u2019s allocation of respondent\u2019s later-year overpay-\nments to offset her 2010 tax liability.  Pet. App. 20a-25a.  \nIn so holding, the court of appeals reasoned that, while \n\u201cit may be that Congress has not explicitly granted the \nTax Court such power,\u201d there is nevertheless \u201can im-\nplicit grant\u201d of jurisdiction that \u201callows the [Tax] Court \nto review setoffs in any event.\u201d  Id. at 20a. \n\n32 \n \nRespondent did not defend that aspect of the court \nof appeals\u2019 decision in her brief in opposition.  And for \ngood reason.  Tax Court jurisdiction must be expressly \nconferred by statute.  See p. 16, supra; 26 U.S.C. 7442 \n(\u201cThe Tax Court and its divisions shall have such juris-\ndiction as is conferred on them by this title, by chapters \n1, 2, 3, and 4 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, by \ntitle II and title III of the Revenue Act of 1926 (44 Stat. \n10\u201387), or by laws enacted subsequent to February 26, \n1926.\u201d).  And no statute grants the Tax Court jurisdic-\ntion to review in a Section 6330 proceeding the IRS\u2019s \nexercise of authority under Section 6402(a) to credit (or \noffset) a taxpayer\u2019s overpayments against her tax liabil-\nity.  To the contrary, Section 6330 grants the Tax Court \njurisdiction only to review\u2014and, if necessary, enjoin\u2014\nthe \u201clevy action[]\u201d that is the \u201csubject of the requested \nhearing.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(1).  It does not affect the \nIRS\u2019s ability to take other enforcement actions, includ-\ning the authority to credit overpayments against exist-\ning liabilities under Section 6402; nor does it grant the \nTax Court jurisdiction to review such actions.  See 26 \nC.F.R. 301.6330\u20131(g)(2), Q & A-G3; see also Belloff v. \nCommissioner, 996 F.2d 607, 616 (2d Cir. 1993).  Courts \nhave therefore repeatedly held that the Tax Court lacks \njurisdiction to review Section 6402(a) credits in a Sec-\ntion 6330 proceeding.  See, e.g., Boyd v. Commissioner, \n451 F.3d 8, 10-11 (1st Cir. 2006); Greene-Thapedi, 126 \nT.C. at 7-8.   \nMoreover, even if the Tax Court had jurisdiction to \nreview the application of credits under Section 6402 in \na Section 6330 proceeding, the court of appeals\u2019 moot-\nness holding would still be erroneous.  The court of ap-\npeals reasoned that the Tax Court has jurisdiction to \nreview the IRS\u2019s use of respondent\u2019s overpayments to \n\n33 \n \noffset her tax liability, and that those offsets were inva-\nlid, such that respondent should be deemed to have an \noutstanding tax liability for 2010.  Pet. App. 20a-25a.  \nAnd the court of appeals took the view that the Tax \nCourt therefore has jurisdiction to consider respond-\nent\u2019s challenge to \u201cthe IRS\u2019s application of the esti-\nmated payments\u201d to Gennardo rather than respondent.  \nPet. App. 19a.  But the Tax Court would have jurisdic-\ntion under Section 6330 to consider such a challenge \nonly in connection with a live dispute over a proposed \nlevy.  See pp. 16-31, supra.  And the IRS has no basis \nfor pursuing a levy so long as respondent\u2019s overpay-\nments remain \u201cin the government\u2019s pocket.\u201d  Pet. App. \n25a.  Nor did the court of appeals conclude that the Tax \nCourt could order the IRS to refund those overpay-\nments.  See p. 29 n.4, supra.  Thus, even if the applica-\ntion of credits was invalid\u2014and it was not5\u2014the Section \n6330 proceeding would still be moot at this point.  \nD. The Instant Case Is Moot \nApplying the foregoing principles, respondent\u2019s case \nis moot.  In 2012, respondent self-reported to the IRS \nthat she owed $21,918 in taxes for tax year 2010.  C.A. \nApp. 475.  The IRS assessed liability based on respond-\nent\u2019s representation.  Id. at 280; see 26 U.S.C. 6201(a)(1).  \nWhen the IRS then proposed to collect the liability by \n \n5 The court of appeals concluded that the application of credits vi-\nolated the common-law rule that \u201ca creditor cannot set off a disputed \ndebt with an undisputed one.\u201d  Pet. App. 22a.  But that rule has no \napplication under Section 6402(a), which authorizes the IRS to \n\u201ccredit the amount of [an] overpayment  * * *  against any liability,\u201d \nundisputed or not.  26 U.S.C. 6402(a).  The court also reasoned that \nthe application of credits violated \u201cArticle III mootness principles.\u201d  \nPet. App. 25a.  But no such principles limit the IRS\u2019s exercise of \nstatutory authority under Section 6402(a). \n\n34 \n \nadministrative levy, respondent timely requested a pre-\ndeprivation hearing under Section 6330 to argue that \ncertain estimated tax payments should be applied to her \naccount, which would have (more than) satisfied her re-\nported tax liability, such that the proposed levy could \nnot go forward.  C.A. App. 566.   \nDuring the pendency of her pre-levy proceedings, re-\nspondent made overpayments for subsequent tax years, \nand, under Section 6402(a), the IRS credited those new \npayments against respondent\u2019s 2010 liability.  With no \nunpaid tax remaining on respondent\u2019s underlying liabil-\nity, there is no basis to proceed with the levy that re-\nspondent had challenged.  In these circumstances, there \nis no live dispute subject to Section 6330, and the Tax \nCourt can grant no further relief in a Section 6330 pro-\nceeding.  The case is therefore moot.   \nContrary to respondent\u2019s suggestion, that result \ndoes not violate \u201cthe presumption favoring judicial re-\nview of administrative action.\u201d  Br. in Opp. 23 (citation \nomitted).  As respondent has acknowledged (id. at 2, 4, \n13, 16, 25), a holding that her Section 6330 proceeding \nis moot will not foreclose her from seeking judicial re-\nview because she could file a refund suit\u2014the tradi-\ntional mechanism for disputing the assessment or col-\nlection of a federal tax, and the one that is available re-\ngardless of whether the IRS had ever proposed to levy \non respondent\u2019s property.  See 26 U.S.C. 7422(a); 28 \nU.S.C. 1346(a)(1); see also 26 U.S.C. 7422(d) (deeming \noverpayment credits to be \u201cpayment[s]\u201d for purposes of \na refund suit).  This Court should hew to Section 6330\u2019s \nplain text, which limits the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to a \ndispute over a proposed levy. \n\n35 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThis Court should reverse the judgment of the court \nof appeals. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nSARAH M.

The answer is yes. The Tax Court has juris-\ndiction under Internal Revenue Code \u00a7 6330(d)(1) to \nreview the Appeals Office\u2019s determination and the \nmatters and issues that determination resolves, and \nnothing in \u00a7 6330 conditions that jurisdiction on the \nIRS\u2019s continuing pursuit of a levy. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1); \nsee I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c). The Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to re-\nview the Appeals Office\u2019s determination thus gives the \ncourt authority to rule on the taxpayer\u2019s unpaid tax or \nunderlying liability. And because the government is \nexpected to abide by judicial rulings, those rulings \nwould redress Zuch\u2019s pocketbook injury. This case is \nnot moot. \nJennifer Zuch owed about $27,000 for the 2010 tax \nyear. But she and her ex-husband had already made \n$50,000 in estimated payments to the IRS for the 2010 \ntax year, and Zuch asked the IRS to apply those pay-\nments to her tax bill. Zuch\u2019s ex-husband agreed that \nthose tax payments should be applied to Zuch\u2019s tax \nbill. But the IRS refused. Instead, it applied the full \n$50,000 in estimated payments to Zuch\u2019s ex-husband\u2019s \nbalance. It then threatened to seize Zuch\u2019s property to \ncollect her 2010 tax assessment. \nZuch exercised her right to a hearing under \n\u00a7 6330, which provides taxpayers with procedural pro-\ntections before the IRS may levy their property to \ncollect taxes. Congress enacted \u00a7 6330 as part of the \nInternal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform \n\n2 \n \n \nAct in response to abusive IRS collections practices \nthat forced some taxpayers to spend their life\u2019s sav-\nings on taxes the IRS or courts later determined they \nnever even owed. Practices & Procedures of the Inter-\nnal Revenue Service: Hearings Before the Committee \non Finance, 105th Cong., S. Hrg. 105-190 at 75-82 \n(1997) [hereinafter Hearings Before the Committee on \nFinance] (statement of Katherine Lund Hicks). Sec-\ntion 6330 ensures that taxpayers can dispute their tax \nbill before having to pay. The provision allows taxpay-\ners threatened with a levy to initiate administrative \nhearings before the Appeals Office and to raise \u201cany \nrelevant issue relating to the unpaid tax\u201d or challenge \ntheir liability if they haven\u2019t yet had a chance to do so. \nI.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2). Section 6330 also grants taxpayers \nan opportunity for meaningful judicial review by \ngranting the Tax Court jurisdiction to review the Ap-\npeals Office\u2019s determination. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). \nAt her administrative hearing, Zuch argued that \nthe IRS should have credited her with the $50,000 in \nestimated payments that she and her ex-husband had \nmade. Those payments would have covered her 2010 \ntax bill and entitled her to a refund. The Appeals Of-\nfice disagreed, concluding that Zuch was not entitled \nto any portion of the estimated payments and uphold-\ning the proposed levy. Zuch petitioned the Tax Court \nfor review of the Appeals Office\u2019s determination. But \nduring the course of the Tax Court proceedings, the \nIRS kept overpayments that Zuch made for later tax \nyears and used them to offset her disputed 2010 lia-\nbility. By 2019, after six years of litigation, the IRS \nclaimed that Zuch had satisfied the disputed liability, \nand it moved to dismiss the Tax Court proceedings as \nmoot. \n\n3 \n \n \nThe Tax Court agreed and dismissed the petition. \nAccording to the court, because there was no unpaid \nliability and no levy, the case was moot. Pet. App. 43a. \nThe court of appeals vacated and remanded. In a \npart of the opinion joined by two panel members, the \ncourt held that the case was not moot because the Tax \nCourt had jurisdiction to review the Appeals Office\u2019s \ndetermination of and declare Zuch\u2019s liability. Pet. \nApp. 25a-26a; see Pet. App. 25a-38a. And a declara-\ntory judgment, the court concluded, would redress \nZuch\u2019s injury. Pet. App. 37a-38a. \nThe court of appeals correctly recognized that the \nTax Court had jurisdiction to review the Appeals Of-\nfice\u2019s determination and that this case is not moot. \nThis Court should affirm. \n1. a. The Tax Court had, and retained, jurisdic-\ntion to review the Appeals Office\u2019s determination. \nSection 6330\u2019s plain text states that the Tax Court \n\u201cshall have jurisdiction\u201d to \u201creview\u201d the Appeals Of-\nfice\u2019s \u201cdetermination,\u201d including its resolution of \u201cany \nrelevant issue relating to the unpaid tax,\u201d or the tax-\npayer\u2019s \u201cunderlying tax liability.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2), \n(c)(3), (d)(1). Nothing in that language, or anything \nelse in \u00a7 6330, requires an ongoing attempt to levy the \ntaxpayer\u2019s property. Thus, the Tax Court retains ju-\nrisdiction \nto \nreview \nthe \nAppeals \nOffice\u2019s \ndetermination, even if the IRS stops pursuing a levy, \nso long as the taxpayer continues to dispute her un-\npaid tax or underlying liability. That makes sense, \ngiven that the whole point of \u00a7 6330 is to make sure \nthat levy proceedings are fair and that a taxpayer can \nchallenge her liability if she had no prior opportunity \nto do so. Indeed, the very design of \u00a7 6330 seeks to en-\nsure that the government is \u201cturn[ing] square corners \n\n4 \n \n \nin dealing with the people,\u201d Department of Homeland \nSecurity v. Regents of the University of California, 591 \nU.S. 1, 24 (2020).  \nb. This case is not moot. The Tax Court had au-\nthority to determine Zuch\u2019s entitlement to the \nprepayments. See I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). A case is moot \nonly when the parties no longer retain any interest in \nthe outcome of the proceedings. But here, both parties \nhave a concrete interest in the outcome of the litiga-\ntion: If Zuch wins, the IRS will likely refund her \nmoney. If the IRS wins, it will keep her money. Either \nway, the Tax Court\u2019s ruling will be preclusive in a re-\nfund suit\u2014which the government has invited Zuch to \nfile\u2014so the stakes are real. And Zuch has now filed a \nrefund suit in the District of New Jersey seeking to \nrecover some of her overpayments. \n2. The IRS\u2019s counterarguments are meritless. \nThe IRS claims that the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to re-\nview the Appeals Office\u2019s determination vanished, and \nthat the case is moot, because the IRS decided it no \nlonger needed a levy after it took Zuch\u2019s money an-\nother way. The government\u2019s arguments fail.  \nFirst, the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to review \nwhether Zuch was entitled to the prepayments didn\u2019t \ndisappear once the IRS stopped pursuing the levy. \nPlain text makes that clear. Although the term \u201clevy\u201d \nappears throughout \u00a7 6330, the provision that grants \nthe Tax Court jurisdiction over the Appeals Office\u2019s \ndetermination\u2014\u00a7 6330(d)(1)\u2014doesn\u2019t condition juris-\ndiction on a levy. History and purpose don\u2019t help the \ngovernment, either. Congress enacted \u00a7 6330 to rem-\nedy IRS abuses and give taxpayers a fair shot at \ndisputing what they owe before collection, underscor-\ning why Congress likely wanted the Tax Court to \n\n5 \n \n \nretain jurisdiction to resolve disputes over unpaid tax \nand liability. Section 6330 must be construed in light \nof that remedial purpose.  \nInvoking Royal Canin U.S.A., Inc. v. Wullschleger, \n604 U.S. 22 (2025), the government claims that the \nTax Court lost jurisdiction because the IRS fundamen-\ntally altered the basis of the suit when it decided not \nto seek the levy. But again, \u00a7 6330 gave the Tax Court \njurisdiction to review an Appeals Office determination \nand nothing in the provision requires a levy. See I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1). Put differently, \u00a7 6330(d) gives the Tax \nCourt jurisdiction so long as the taxpayer challenges \nan Appeals Office determination. The Court recently \nmade clear in the \u00a7 6330 context that a procedural re-\nquirement is jurisdictional only if Congress \u201cclearly \nstates\u201d that it is. Boechler, P.C. v. Commissioner, 596 \nU.S. 199, 203 (2022). But the word \u201clevy\u201d doesn\u2019t even \nappear in \u00a7 6330(d). In any event, even if \u00a7 6330 re-\nquired a levy, the requirement would look to the time \nof filing, and there was a proposed levy when Zuch pe-\ntitioned the Tax Court.  \nAppealing to policy, the government says that if \nthe Tax Court has jurisdiction to review liability dis-\nputes like Zuch\u2019s, the Tax Court will become a forum \nfor general liability claims. For starters, the govern-\nment hasn\u2019t pointed to any cases showing that \ntaxpayers are invoking \u00a7 6330 to bring general liabil-\nity challenges. Plus, to invoke the Tax Court\u2019s \u00a7 6330 \njurisdiction, a taxpayer needs an Appeals Office deter-\nmination. The Tax Court can address unpaid tax or \nliability issues only if the Appeals Office\u2019s determina-\ntion resolved them. What\u2019s more, the question \npresented in this case rarely arises, and when it does, \nit\u2019s only because the IRS starts levy proceedings, gets \nthe taxpayer\u2019s money another way, and once the Tax \n\n6 \n \n \nCourt is reviewing the determination, decides to aban-\ndon the levy midstream. The IRS can easily avoid its \nself-made problem.  \nSecond, the government asserts that the Tax \nCourt lacks authority to declare Zuch\u2019s entitlement to \nthe prepayments because the Declaratory Judgment \nAct (DJA) and Anti-Injunction Act (AIA) generally \nprohibit courts from issuing declaratory and injunc-\ntive relief in federal tax cases. That argument fails. \nSection 6330(d)(1) authorizes the Tax Court to deter-\nmine the taxpayer\u2019s unpaid tax and underlying \nliability in \u00a7 6330 proceedings. And \u00a7 6330(e)(1) con-\nfirms that the Tax Court can issue declaratory relief, \nexempting \u00a7 6330 proceedings from the DJA\u2019s and \nAIA\u2019s prohibitions on declaratory and injunctive relief \nin other tax cases.  \nFinally, the government claims it mooted the case \nby abandoning the levy because the levy gave rise to \nthe proceeding. But that\u2019s not how moot\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

See I.R.C. \u00a7 6330. At the hearing, the \ntaxpayer may raise \u201cany relevant issue relating to the \nunpaid \ntax \nor \nthe \nproposed \nlevy.\u201d \nI.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A). The taxpayer may also challenge her \nunderlying tax liability if she did not previously have \nan opportunity to do so. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B). The Ap-\npeals Office issues a \u201cdetermination,\u201d which \u201cshall \ntake into consideration\u201d \u201cthe issues raised under par-\nagraph (2),\u201d including any challenge relating to the \nunpaid tax or the taxpayer\u2019s liability.

The answer is yes. The Tax Court has juris-\ndiction under Internal Revenue Code \u00a7 6330(d)(1) to \nreview the Appeals Office\u2019s determination and the \nmatters and issues that determination resolves, and \nnothing in \u00a7 6330 conditions that jurisdiction on the \nIRS\u2019s continuing pursuit of a levy. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1); \nsee I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c). The Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to re-\nview the Appeals Office\u2019s determination thus gives the \ncourt authority to rule on the taxpayer\u2019s unpaid tax or \nunderlying liability. And because the government is \nexpected to abide by judicial rulings, those rulings \nwould redress Zuch\u2019s pocketbook injury. This case is \nnot moot. \nJennifer Zuch owed about $27,000 for the 2010 tax \nyear. But she and her ex-husband had already made \n$50,000 in estimated payments to the IRS for the 2010 \ntax year, and Zuch asked the IRS to apply those pay-\nments to her tax bill. Zuch\u2019s ex-husband agreed that \nthose tax payments should be applied to Zuch\u2019s tax \nbill. But the IRS refused. Instead, it applied the full \n$50,000 in estimated payments to Zuch\u2019s ex-husband\u2019s \nbalance. It then threatened to seize Zuch\u2019s property to \ncollect her 2010 tax assessment. \nZuch exercised her right to a hearing under \n\u00a7 6330, which provides taxpayers with procedural pro-\ntections before the IRS may levy their property to \ncollect taxes. Congress enacted \u00a7 6330 as part of the \nInternal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform \n\n2 \n \n \nAct in response to abusive IRS collections practices \nthat forced some taxpayers to spend their life\u2019s sav-\nings on taxes the IRS or courts later determined they \nnever even owed. Practices & Procedures of the Inter-\nnal Revenue Service: Hearings Before the Committee \non Finance, 105th Cong., S. Hrg. 105-190 at 75-82 \n(1997) [hereinafter Hearings Before the Committee on \nFinance] (statement of Katherine Lund Hicks). Sec-\ntion 6330 ensures that taxpayers can dispute their tax \nbill before having to pay. The provision allows taxpay-\ners threatened with a levy to initiate administrative \nhearings before the Appeals Office and to raise \u201cany \nrelevant issue relating to the unpaid tax\u201d or challenge \ntheir liability if they haven\u2019t yet had a chance to do so. \nI.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2). Section 6330 also grants taxpayers \nan opportunity for meaningful judicial review by \ngranting the Tax Court jurisdiction to review the Ap-\npeals Office\u2019s determination. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). \nAt her administrative hearing, Zuch argued that \nthe IRS should have credited her with the $50,000 in \nestimated payments that she and her ex-husband had \nmade. Those payments would have covered her 2010 \ntax bill and entitled her to a refund. The Appeals Of-\nfice disagreed, concluding that Zuch was not entitled \nto any portion of the estimated payments and uphold-\ning the proposed levy. Zuch petitioned the Tax Court \nfor review of the Appeals Office\u2019s determination. But \nduring the course of the Tax Court proceedings, the \nIRS kept overpayments that Zuch made for later tax \nyears and used them to offset her disputed 2010 lia-\nbility. By 2019, after six years of litigation, the IRS \nclaimed that Zuch had satisfied the disputed liability, \nand it moved to dismiss the Tax Court proceedings as \nmoot. \n\n3 \n \n \nThe Tax Court agreed and dismissed the petition. \nAccording to the court, because there was no unpaid \nliability and no levy, the case was moot. Pet. App. 43a. \nThe court of appeals vacated and remanded. In a \npart of the opinion joined by two panel members, the \ncourt held that the case was not moot because the Tax \nCourt had jurisdiction to review the Appeals Office\u2019s \ndetermination of and declare Zuch\u2019s liability. Pet. \nApp. 25a-26a; see Pet. App. 25a-38a. And a declara-\ntory judgment, the court concluded, would redress \nZuch\u2019s injury. Pet. App. 37a-38a. \nThe court of appeals correctly recognized that the \nTax Court had jurisdiction to review the Appeals Of-\nfice\u2019s determination and that this case is not moot. \nThis Court should affirm. \n1. a. The Tax Court had, and retained, jurisdic-\ntion to review the Appeals Office\u2019s determination. \nSection 6330\u2019s plain text states that the Tax Court \n\u201cshall have jurisdiction\u201d to \u201creview\u201d the Appeals Of-\nfice\u2019s \u201cdetermination,\u201d including its resolution of \u201cany \nrelevant issue relating to the unpaid tax,\u201d or the tax-\npayer\u2019s \u201cunderlying tax liability.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2), \n(c)(3), (d)(1). Nothing in that language, or anything \nelse in \u00a7 6330, requires an ongoing attempt to levy the \ntaxpayer\u2019s property. Thus, the Tax Court retains ju-\nrisdiction \nto \nreview \nthe \nAppeals \nOffice\u2019s \ndetermination, even if the IRS stops pursuing a levy, \nso long as the taxpayer continues to dispute her un-\npaid tax or underlying liability. That makes sense, \ngiven that the whole point of \u00a7 6330 is to make sure \nthat levy proceedings are fair and that a taxpayer can \nchallenge her liability if she had no prior opportunity \nto do so. Indeed, the very design of \u00a7 6330 seeks to en-\nsure that the government is \u201cturn[ing] square corners \n\n4 \n \n \nin dealing with the people,\u201d Department of Homeland \nSecurity v. Regents of the University of California, 591 \nU.S. 1, 24 (2020).  \nb. This case is not moot. The Tax Court had au-\nthority to determine Zuch\u2019s entitlement to the \nprepayments. See I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). A case is moot \nonly when the parties no longer retain any interest in \nthe outcome of the proceedings. But here, both parties \nhave a concrete interest in the outcome of the litiga-\ntion: If Zuch wins, the IRS will likely refund her \nmoney. If the IRS wins, it will keep her money. Either \nway, the Tax Court\u2019s ruling will be preclusive in a re-\nfund suit\u2014which the government has invited Zuch to \nfile\u2014so the stakes are real. And Zuch has now filed a \nrefund suit in the District of New Jersey seeking to \nrecover some of her overpayments. \n2. The IRS\u2019s counterarguments are meritless. \nThe IRS claims that the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to re-\nview the Appeals Office\u2019s determination vanished, and \nthat the case is moot, because the IRS decided it no \nlonger needed a levy after it took Zuch\u2019s money an-\nother way. The government\u2019s arguments fail.  \nFirst, the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to review \nwhether Zuch was entitled to the prepayments didn\u2019t \ndisappear once the IRS stopped pursuing the levy. \nPlain text makes that clear. Although the term \u201clevy\u201d \nappears throughout \u00a7 6330, the provision that grants \nthe Tax Court jurisdiction over the Appeals Office\u2019s \ndetermination\u2014\u00a7 6330(d)(1)\u2014doesn\u2019t condition juris-\ndiction on a levy. History and purpose don\u2019t help the \ngovernment, either. Congress enacted \u00a7 6330 to rem-\nedy IRS abuses and give taxpayers a fair shot at \ndisputing what they owe before collection, underscor-\ning why Congress likely wanted the Tax Court to \n\n5 \n \n \nretain jurisdiction to resolve disputes over unpaid tax \nand liability. Section 6330 must be construed in light \nof that remedial purpose.  \nInvoking Royal Canin U.S.A., Inc. v. Wullschleger, \n604 U.S. 22 (2025), the government claims that the \nTax Court lost jurisdiction because the IRS fundamen-\ntally altered the basis of the suit when it decided not \nto seek the levy. But again, \u00a7 6330 gave the Tax Court \njurisdiction to review an Appeals Office determination \nand nothing in the provision requires a levy. See I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1). Put differently, \u00a7 6330(d) gives the Tax \nCourt jurisdiction so long as the taxpayer challenges \nan Appeals Office determination. The Court recently \nmade clear in the \u00a7 6330 context that a procedural re-\nquirement is jurisdictional only if Congress \u201cclearly \nstates\u201d that it is. Boechler, P.C. v. Commissioner, 596 \nU.S. 199, 203 (2022). But the word \u201clevy\u201d doesn\u2019t even \nappear in \u00a7 6330(d). In any event, even if \u00a7 6330 re-\nquired a levy, the requirement would look to the time \nof filing, and there was a proposed levy when Zuch pe-\ntitioned the Tax Court.  \nAppealing to policy, the government says that if \nthe Tax Court has jurisdiction to review liability dis-\nputes like Zuch\u2019s, the Tax Court will become a forum \nfor general liability claims. For starters, the govern-\nment hasn\u2019t pointed to any cases showing that \ntaxpayers are invoking \u00a7 6330 to bring general liabil-\nity challenges. Plus, to invoke the Tax Court\u2019s \u00a7 6330 \njurisdiction, a taxpayer needs an Appeals Office deter-\nmination. The Tax Court can address unpaid tax or \nliability issues only if the Appeals Office\u2019s determina-\ntion resolved them. What\u2019s more, the question \npresented in this case rarely arises, and when it does, \nit\u2019s only because the IRS starts levy proceedings, gets \nthe taxpayer\u2019s money another way, and once the Tax \n\n6 \n \n \nCourt is reviewing the determination, decides to aban-\ndon the levy midstream. The IRS can easily avoid its \nself-made problem.  \nSecond, the government asserts that the Tax \nCourt lacks authority to declare Zuch\u2019s entitlement to \nthe prepayments because the Declaratory Judgment \nAct (DJA) and Anti-Injunction Act (AIA) generally \nprohibit courts from issuing declaratory and injunc-\ntive relief in federal tax cases. That argument fails. \nSection 6330(d)(1) authorizes the Tax Court to deter-\nmine the taxpayer\u2019s unpaid tax and underlying \nliability in \u00a7 6330 proceedings. And \u00a7 6330(e)(1) con-\nfirms that the Tax Court can issue declaratory relief, \nexempting \u00a7 6330 proceedings from the DJA\u2019s and \nAIA\u2019s prohibitions on declaratory and injunctive relief \nin other tax cases.  \nFinally, the government claims it mooted the case \nby abandoning the levy because the levy gave rise to \nthe proceeding. But that\u2019s not how mootness works. \nThe question is whether the parties retain any inter-\nest in the outcome of the litigation. And here, both \nZuch and the IRS have a concrete interest in whether \nand how the Tax Court adjudicates Zuch\u2019s entitlement \nto the estimated payments. \nThe Court should affirm the court of appeals\u2019 de-\ncision and remand so the Tax Court can consider \nZuch\u2019s merits arguments. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal background \n1. Taxpayers often have various ways to dispute \nthe amount of income taxes and other taxes the IRS \nclaims they owe. If the IRS determines that a taxpayer \nowes more taxes than she reported on her tax return, \n\n7 \n \n \nthe IRS typically sends her a notice of deficiency. \nI.R.C. \u00a7 6212(a). Within 90 days, the taxpayer may \nchallenge the claimed deficiency in Tax Court. I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6213(a). In the deficiency proceeding, the Tax Court \ncan determine the correct amount of tax owed and \nwhether the taxpayer made overpayments, entitling \nthe taxpayer to a refund or credit. I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6214(a), \n6512(b)(1). The Tax Court\u2019s final decision is reviewa-\nble by a court of appeals. I.R.C. \u00a7 7482(a)(1). If the \ntaxpayer does not challenge the deficiency, she can \npay the disputed amount and seek a refund in district \ncourt or the Court of Federal Claims. 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1346(a)(1); see I.R.C. \u00a7 7422(a).  \n2. This case centers on a third way a taxpayer \ncan challenge the taxes the IRS assesses when the \ntaxpayer has not paid the taxes the IRS claims she \nowes and the IRS seeks to collect by levying the tax-\npayer\u2019s property. Sometimes, a tax remains unpaid \neven after a taxpayer receives a notice of deficiency. \nOr perhaps a taxpayer hasn\u2019t paid the amount the IRS \nclaims she owes, but she didn\u2019t receive a notice of de-\nficiency or otherwise have an opportunity to dispute \nher liability. In either situation, the IRS may decide \nto pursue a levy on the taxpayer\u2019s property. I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6331(a), (b). \nIf the IRS issues a levy notice, the taxpayer has 30 \ndays to request an administrative hearing before the \nAppeals Office under I.R.C. \u00a7 6330, sometimes called \na \u201ccollection due process\u201d hearing, to challenge the \nproposed levy and her underlying tax liability. I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(b), (c)(2)(B); see Boechler, 596 U.S. at 202; \nByers v. Commissioner, 740 F.3d 668, 671-72 (D.C. \nCir. 2014). This case involves a \u00a7 6330 proceeding in \nwhich the parties dispute the taxpayer\u2019s liability and \nunpaid tax.  \n\n8 \n \n \na. The issues a taxpayer may raise in a collection \ndue process hearing depend in part on whether the \ntaxpayer received a notice of deficiency or had another \nopportunity to dispute her liability. If she did not, she \nmay raise \u201cchallenges to the existence or amount\u201d of \nher liability. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B). A collection due \nprocess hearing thus serves as a backstop, ensuring \nthat a taxpayer has an opportunity to dispute her un-\nderlying tax liability because she was not able to do so \nearlier. Liability challenges aside, all taxpayers in col-\nlection due process proceedings may raise \u201cany \nrelevant issue relating to the unpaid tax or the pro-\nposed levy, including\u201d \u201cappropriate spousal defenses,\u201d \n\u201cchallenges to the appropriateness of collection ac-\ntions,\u201d and \u201coffers of collection alternatives,\u201d no \nmatter whether they had an earlier opportunity to dis-\npute their liability. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A). The Appeals \nOffice then makes a \u201cdetermination\u201d that \u201cshall take \ninto consideration\u201d the taxpayer\u2019s challenge to the un-\npaid tax, her underlying liability, and any other issues \nraised. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(3). \nAlthough it is an important backstop, a collection \ndue process hearing \u201clacks the typical hallmarks of a \njudicial hearing\u201d and is \u201cfar from \u2026 a formal hearing.\u201d \nFarhy v. Commissioner, 100 F.4th 223, 227 (D.C. Cir. \n2024). \u201cThere are no formal discovery procedures, and \nthe taxpayer has no right to subpoena documents or \nwitnesses.\u201d Id. Rather, the hearing \u201cprovides the tax-\npayer \u2018an opportunity for an informal oral or written \nconversation with the IRS.\u2019\u201d Id. \nAfter the Appeals Office issues its \u201cdetermina-\ntion,\u201d the taxpayer may \u201cpetition the Tax Court for \nreview of such determination (and the Tax Court shall \nhave jurisdiction with respect to such matter).\u201d I.R.C. \n\n9 \n \n \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1). The Tax Court\u2019s final judgment is subject \nto review in a court of appeals. I.R.C. \u00a7 7482(a)(1). \nb. Congress enacted \u00a7 6330 in 1998 to protect \ntaxpayers from the IRS\u2019s abusive tax collection prac-\ntices. E.g., 144 Cong. Rec. S4027-32 (daily ed. May 1, \n1998). Leading up to \u00a7 6330\u2019s enactment, Congress \nheld a series of hearings that shed light on those prac-\ntices. For example, taxpayers couldn\u2019t contest a levy \nbefore the IRS seized their property. See Phillips v. \nCommissioner, 283 U.S. 589, 595-96 (1931). And tax-\npayers were often forced to drain their life\u2019s savings\u2014\nand their family\u2019s\u2014to pay assessments they never \neven owed. Hearings Before the Committee on Finance \nat 75-82 (statement of Katherine Lund Hicks). After \nthe hearings, \u201c[m]any people were shocked to learn \nthat a number of the due-process protections Ameri-\ncans take for granted in other legal proceedings do not \napply to actions involving the IRS.\u201d 144 Cong. Rec. \nS4031 (statement of Sen. Enzi). As one member put it, \n\u201cthe problem is, [the IRS] ha[s] too much power, they \nhave no checks and balances.\u201d Hearings Before the \nCommittee on Finance at 56 (statement of Sen. \nGramm). \nIn designing \u00a7 6330, Congress sought to \u201censure \nthat all taxpayers have due process and that the IRS \ndoes not abusively use its liens-and-seizure author-\nity.\u201d 143 Cong. Rec. S12231 (daily ed. Nov. 9, 1997) \n(statement of Sen. Roth). Indeed, the point of \u00a7 6330 \nproceedings is to \u201cincrease fairness to taxpayers\u201d be-\nfore the IRS deprives them of their property. S. Rep. \nNo. 105-174, at 67 (1998). And, as the Tax Court has \nobserved, Congress sought to ensure that the Commis-\nsioner would \u201ccollect the correct amount of tax, and do \nso by observing all applicable laws and administrative \n\n10 \n \n \nprocedures.\u201d Montgomery v. Commissioner, 122 T.C. \n1, 10 (2004). \nTo that end, \u00a7 6330 allows a taxpayer to raise is-\nsues relating to the unpaid tax and also challenge her \nliability if she did not have an earlier opportunity to \ndo so. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2). Section 6330 also gives the \ntaxpayer a chance \u201cto petition the Tax Court to contest \nthe Appeals [Office\u2019s] decision.\u201d 144 Cong. Rec. S4494 \n(daily ed. May 7, 1998) (statement of Sen. Hatch). And \nonce a taxpayer has petitioned the Tax Court, that \ncourt can enjoin any action or proceeding \u201cin respect \nof the unpaid tax or proposed levy.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(e)(1). \nThat makes sense: ensuring that the IRS is collecting \nthe correct amount of tax requires giving taxpayers an \nopportunity to dispute issues relating to the taxes \nthey haven\u2019t paid and their tax liability, and having \nthe Tax Court weigh in before the IRS can take their \nmoney. \nB. Factual and procedural background \nThis case arises from a dispute over whether the \nIRS properly credited $50,000 in overpayments from \nZuch and her ex-husband, Patrick Gennardo, to Gen-\nnardo\u2019s tax bill rather than Zuch\u2019s in the wake of their \ndivorce. Both Zuch and Gennardo maintain that the \nIRS should have credited Zuch\u2019s account, but the IRS \ninstead credited Gennardo\u2019s, sought to levy Zuch\u2019s \nproperty, and unilaterally decided to withhold over-\npayments Zuch made in later tax years. \n1. Zuch and Gennardo were married from 1993 \nto 2014. Pet. App. 7a. They separated in 2010, and \nZuch initiated divorce proceedings in 2012. CA3 \nApp. A118. During that time, the IRS assessed sub-\nstantial taxes against Zuch and Gennardo, prompting \nyears of litigation. \n\n11 \n \n \na. In 2010 and 2011, Zuch and Gennardo submit-\nted $50,000 in prepayments to the IRS for what they \nestimated would be their 2010 tax liability. Pet. \nApp. 8a. In particular, in June 2010, they submitted \nan estimated payment of $20,000 using a check drawn \nfrom a bank account listing both their names. Pet. \nApp. 8a & n.11. The form accompanying the check also \nlisted both names. Pet. App. 8a n.11, 51a. In January \n2011, Gennardo sent the IRS a check for $30,000. Pet. \nApp. 8a. The subject line of the letter accompanying \nthe check read \u201cRe: Patrick J. Gennardo and Jennifer \nZuch,\u201d and although the check was from Zuch and \nGennardo\u2019s joint bank account, the check listed only \nGennardo\u2019s name. Pet. App. 8a n.12, 51a. At the time, \nZuch and Gennardo didn\u2019t tell the IRS how to allocate \nthe payments. Pet. App. 8a. \nb. In 2012 and 2013, Zuch and Gennardo filed \nuntimely, and later amended, tax returns for 2010, \nand the IRS applied the $50,000 in prepayments to \nGennardo\u2019s, rather than Zuch\u2019s, tax bill. Pet. App. 7a-\n8a. The IRS\u2019s decision gave rise to the parties\u2019 dispute \nover Zuch\u2019s 2010 tax balance. \nIn September 2012, Zuch and Gennardo each filed \na married-filing-separately income tax return. Pet. \nApp. 7a. Zuch\u2019s return showed an adjusted gross in-\ncome of $74,493 and a $731 overpayment, and didn\u2019t \nmention the prepayments from 2010 and 2011. Pet. \nApp. 7a-8a & n.9. Gennardo\u2019s return showed an ad-\njusted gross income of $1,077,213, indicated that he \nowed $385,393 in taxes, and reported $10,000 in esti-\nmated payments. Pet. App. 8a-9a, 52a. The same day \nthat Gennardo filed his return, he also filed an offer-\nin-compromise, seeking to settle his accumulated tax \ndebts at less than the amount due. Id.; see I.R.C. \n\u00a7 7122(a). The IRS later notified him that it had \n\n12 \n \n \napplied the $50,000 in prepayments towards the \n$385,393 in taxes he owed. Pet. App. 8a. \nIn November 2012, Zuch filed an amended return \nfor 2010 to report $71,000 in additional income from a \nretirement account distribution. Pet. App. 9a. Zuch\u2019s \namended return showed that she owed the IRS \n$27,682. Id. She explained that the $50,000 in prepay-\nments should be credited to her and requested a \nrefund of $21,918. Id. In February 2013, the IRS as-\nsessed the additional $27,682 in taxes that Zuch \nreported, but it refused to credit her for the $50,000 or \nissue any refund. Id. \nGennardo also filed an amended return for 2010 \nin November 2012. Pet. App. 52a-53a. On that \namended return, he reported $0 in prepayments. Id. \nSubsequently, in March 2013, while his offer-in-com-\npromise was pending, Gennardo filed a second \namended return for 2010. Pet. App. 9a. He indicated \non that second amended return that the $50,000 in \nprepayments should be credited to Zuch, but the IRS \nstill refused to allocate it to her tax bill. Pet. App. 9a-\n10a; see Pet. App. 55a. \nc. Gennardo later submitted an amended offer-\nin-compromise in which he offered the IRS a signifi-\ncantly larger payment of tax, which the IRS accepted. \nPet. App. 10a. Even though Gennardo had asked the \nIRS to credit the $50,000 to Zuch, the IRS credited the \nentire sum to him. Id. \n2. Zuch never received a notice of deficiency from \nthe IRS. Pet. App. 9a n.13. But in August 2013, the \nIRS notified her that it intended to levy her property \nbecause she had failed to pay her 2010 tax assessment \nand explained that she had 30 days to request a \n\n13 \n \n \ncollection due process hearing before the Appeals Of-\nfice. Pet. App. 10a. \n3. Zuch timely requested a hearing. Id. At the \nhearing, Zuch challenged her \u201cunderlying tax liabil-\nity\u201d because she did not receive a notice of deficiency \nor otherwise have an opportunity to dispute it. I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B); Pet. App. 10a. Zuch argued that the \n$50,000 in prepayments should have been credited to \nher, reducing her tax liability to $0 and entitling her \nto a refund. Pet. App. 10a. \nIn September 2014, the Appeals Office rejected \nZuch\u2019s \u201c[c]hallenges to [her] [l]iability,\u201d Pet. App. 66a, \nand sustained the proposed levy. It told Zuch that it \nwas \u201cnot in a position\u201d to credit her for the $50,000 \nbecause the IRS had credited the money to Gennardo. \nPet. App. 11a. \n4. Zuch petitioned the Tax Court to review the \nAppeals Office\u2019s determination. Id. In particular, she \nsought a ruling that the $50,000 should have been ap-\nplied to her individual tax balance. Id. After the IRS \nmoved for summary judgment, the Tax Court re-\nmanded to the Appeals Office because it wasn\u2019t clear \nwhy the IRS had applied the $50,000 towards Gen-\nnardo\u2019s liability rather than Zuch\u2019s. Pet. App. 11a-\n12a. \n5. In June 2017, the Appeals Office again ruled \nagainst Zuch on the \u201c[i]ssues relating to [her] unpaid \n[underlying] liability,\u201d Pet. App. 48a, and sustained \nthe proposed levy, Pet. App. 12a. It reasoned that the \nlevy \u201cbalance[d] the need for efficient collection of \ntaxes with the taxpayer\u2019s legitimate concern that any \ncollection action be no more intrusive than necessary.\u201d \nCA3 App. A270. \n\n14 \n \n \n6. The case returned to the Tax Court. Pet. \nApp. 12a. Meanwhile, over the course of the six years \nthe \u00a7 6330 proceedings had been pending, Zuch kept \npaying her taxes for later years. In fact, she overpaid. \nBut rather than issuing her refunds, the IRS kept \nZuch\u2019s overpayments and used them to offset her \nclaimed 2010 liability. Pet. App. 12a-13a. The IRS did \nso six times, \u201conce each in 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2019, \nand twice in 2016.\u201d Id. And in April 2019, after the \ncase had returned to the Tax Court, the IRS kept \nZuch\u2019s money a final time to offset the rest of her \nclaimed 2010 tax balance, reducing it to $0. Pet. \nApp. 13a. \nThe IRS then moved to dismiss the Tax Court pro-\nceedings as moot. Id. The Tax Court granted the \nmotion. Id. The Tax Court concluded that it lacked ju-\nrisdiction over the case and that the case was moot \nbecause \u201cthere [was] no unpaid liability \u2026 upon which \na levy could be based,\u201d and the IRS was no longer \nseeking to levy Zuch\u2019s property. Pet. App. 43a. \n7. The Third Circuit vacated the Tax Court\u2019s de-\ncision, held that the Tax Court had jurisdiction under \n\u00a7 6330 to decide Zuch\u2019s challenge to her tax liability or \nunpaid tax, held that the case wasn\u2019t moot, and re-\nmanded for proceedings on the merits. Pet. App. 1a-\n39a. \nThe court first held that the Tax Court had juris-\ndiction to review the Appeals Office\u2019s determination of \nZuch\u2019s liability. Because Zuch had neither received a \nnotice of deficiency nor had an opportunity to contest \nher liability before her collection due process hearing, \nZuch could challenge \u201cthe existence or amount of [her] \nunderlying tax liability\u201d during the hearing. Pet. \nApp. 14a-15a; (quoting I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B)). And, \n\n15 \n \n \nthe court explained, \u201cZuch\u2019s argument that her esti-\nmated tax payments were erroneously allocated to her \nex-husband is a challenge to her underlying tax liabil-\nity under \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B).\u201d Pet. App. 19a. \nThe court of appeals then held that the Tax Court \nhad jurisdiction over Zuch\u2019s challenge, and that Zuch\u2019s \nchallenge was not moot, for two independent reasons. \nPet. App. 19a-38a. First, the court held that Zuch \ncould continue challenging her underlying liability be-\ncause the IRS unlawfully offset it using her \noverpayments in later years. Pet. App. 19a-25a. The \nIRS\u2019s unilateral, illegal actions, the court held, could \nnot moot the case. Pet. App. 25a. Second, in a part of \nthe opinion joined by two panel members, the court \nheld that the Tax Court had jurisdiction to review the \nAppeals Office\u2019s determination of Zuch\u2019s liability and \nissue a declaratory judgment because the parties con-\ntinued to dispute Zuch\u2019s tax liability. Pet. App. 25a-\n26a; see Pet. App. 25a-38a. And a declaratory judg-\nment, the court concluded, would redress Zuch\u2019s \ninjuries. Pet. App. 37a-38a. \n8. The IRS sought rehearing en banc, which the \ncourt of appeals denied. Pet. App. 68a-69a. It then \nsought a writ of certiorari, which this Court granted \non January 10, 2025. \n9. On March 14, 2025, Zuch filed a suit in the \nU.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey seek-\ning refunds for the 2010, 2012, 2013, and 2018 tax \nyears pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(a)(1) and I.R.C. \n\u00a7 7422(a). Compl., Zuch v. United States, No. 2:25-cv-\n01900 (D.N.J. Mar. 14, 2025). If successful, Zuch will \nrecover approximately two-thirds of the taxes the IRS \ncollected after it refused to credit her for the estimated \npayments. See Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 108-09. But Zuch is unable \n\n16 \n \n \nto request the return of approximately $20,000 in \noverpayments the IRS kept from the 2014 and 2015 \ntax years, due to the onerous jurisdictional prerequi-\nsites to filing a refund suit. Compl. \u00b6 109. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI. \nThe Tax Court had jurisdiction to review \nZuch\u2019s challenge relating to her unpaid tax or under-\nlying tax liability, and to adjudicate her entitlement \nto the estimated payments. The Tax Court retained \nthat jurisdiction and authority to issue a binding rul-\ning even after the IRS stopped pursuing the levy. This \ncase isn\u2019t moot.  \nA.  The Tax Court had, and retained, jurisdiction \nto review the Appeals Office\u2019s determination of Zuch\u2019s \nestimated payment dispute. \n1. Section 6330\u2019s plain text makes clear that the \nTax Court has authority to review the Appeals Office\u2019s \ndetermination of a taxpayer\u2019s challenge relating to her \nunpaid tax or underlying liability. Section 6330 pro-\nvides that a taxpayer may raise \u201cany relevant issue \nrelating to the unpaid tax\u201d at a collection due process \nhearing, and also may raise a challenge to her \u201cunder-\nlying tax liability\u201d when she didn\u2019t have an \nopportunity to do so before. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2). The \nAppeals Office\u2019s \u201cdetermination\u201d must \u201ctake [those is-\nsues] into consideration,\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(3), and the \nTax Court \u201cshall have jurisdiction\u201d to review that de-\ntermination, I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). Nothing in those \nprovisions makes jurisdiction turn on a continuing-\nlevy requirement, much less satisfies the requirement \nthat jurisdictional prerequisites be clearly stated, see \nBoechler, 596 U.S. at 203. The Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction \nunder \u00a7 6330 thus doesn\u2019t vanish when the IRS stops \npursuing a levy. \n\n17 \n \n \n2.  Context confirms that Congress gave the Tax \nCourt continuing jurisdiction under \u00a7 6330 to review \nAppeals Office determinations, including their resolu-\ntion of unpaid tax and tax liability issues. Section \n6330(c)(2)(B) ensures that a taxpayer has a chance to \nchallenge the unpaid tax and her underlying liability \nbefore she must pay or face a levy, and without initi-\nating new litigation against the federal government to \nseek a refund, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(a)(1); I.R.C. \n\u00a7 7422(a).  \n3.  The Tax Court had jurisdiction to review the \nAppeals Office\u2019s determination, including Zuch\u2019s enti-\ntlement to the estimated payments. In proceedings \nbefore the Appeals Office, Zuch challenged the IRS\u2019s \nrefusal to apply the estimated payments to her tax \nbill. The Appeals Office rejected her arguments. Zuch \nthen petitioned the Tax Court for review of the Ap-\npeals Office\u2019s determination\u2014including its resolution \nof the unpaid tax or underlying liability dispute. And \nthe Tax Court had jurisdiction under \u00a7 6330 to review \nthe determination of those issues.  \nB. Zuch\u2019s case wasn\u2019t mooted when the IRS de-\ncided that it no longer needed the levy. A case is moot \nonly if the parties no longer have a concrete interest \nin the outcome, and the court can\u2019t issue any relief \nthat would redress a party\u2019s injury. But here, the Tax \nCourt could issue a ruling deciding whether Zuch is \nentitled to have the $50,000 in estimated payments \napplied to her tax bill. So both parties have an interest \nhere. If Zuch prevails, the IRS is likely to issue a re-\nfund, and if the government prevails, the IRS will \nkeep her money. And win or lose, a judgment from the \nTax Court will be preclusive in the refund suit that \nZuch has now filed in the U.S. District Court for the \nDistrict of New Jersey. \n\n18 \n \n \nII. The government\u2019s counterarguments are un-\npersuasive.  \nA. The government claims that the Tax Court\u2019s \njurisdiction to review a taxpayer\u2019s liability challenge \nrequires a continuing attempt to levy the taxpayer\u2019s \nproperty. That is incorrect\u2014the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdic-\ntion didn\u2019t disappear once the IRS no longer needed \nthe levy. \n1. There is no textual basis for the government\u2019s \ncontinuing-levy requirement. To be sure, \u00a7 6330 men-\ntions the word \u201clevy\u201d\u2014after all, a taxpayer can initiate \nadministrative collection due process proceedings be-\nfore the Appeals Office only after being notified that \nthe IRS is going to levy her property. See I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(a)(3)(B), (b)(1). But once the Appeals Office is-\nsues a determination, the taxpayer can seek Tax \nCourt review of the determination under \u00a7 6330(d)(1). \nSection 6330(d)(1)\u2019s plain terms impose no continuing-\nlevy requirement, much less a \u201cclearly state[d]\u201d juris-\ndictional requirement, Boechler, 596 U.S. at 203. \nWhat\u2019s more, the presumption favoring judicial re-\nview of agency actions supports reading \u00a7 6330(d)(1) \nto confer jurisdiction even if the government abandons \nits levy efforts. See Guerrero-Lasprilla v. Barr, 589 \nU.S. 221, 229 (2020). In arguing otherwise, what the \nIRS is really saying is that, in its view, the Tax Court \ncannot redress a taxpayer\u2019s pocketbook injury when \nthere is no pending levy. But that\u2019s not the case, ei-\nther, as this case makes plain.  \n2. Section 6330\u2019s history and purpose confirm \nthat the Tax Court retains jurisdiction over an unpaid \ntax or liability challenge even after the IRS says it \ndoesn\u2019t need a levy anymore. Congress crafted \u00a7 6330 \nas remedial legislation in response to the IRS\u2019s \n\n19 \n \n \nabusive collection practices as part of a statutory \nscheme to increase fairness to taxpayers by allowing \nthem to challenge what they owe before they pay or \nhave their property seized. In light of that remedial \npurpose, \u00a7 6330 should be construed to mean what it \nsays\u2014the Tax Court has jurisdiction over the Appeals \nOffice\u2019s \u201cdetermination.\u201d \n3. Royal Canin doesn\u2019t suggest otherwise. The \ngovernment argues that the IRS fundamentally al-\ntered the basis of the suit when it decided not to seek \nthe levy. But the basis of the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction \nis the Appeals Office\u2019s determination, not any levy. \nAnd decisions holding that jurisdiction depends on the \nstate of play at the time the suit is brought show that \neven assuming \u00a7 6330 contains a pending-levy re-\nquirement, that requirement turns on the time of \nfiling and thus is met here: there was a levy pending \nwhen Zuch petitioned the Tax Court. \n4.  Policy can\u2019t salvage the government\u2019s position, \neither. The government claims that, if the Tax Court \nhas jurisdiction to review a taxpayer\u2019s liability in a \n\u00a7 6330 proceeding after the IRS determines it no \nlonger needs the levy, the floodgates will open and \n\u00a7 6330 proceedings will become a forum for all kinds \nof liability challenges. But the taxpayer may raise a \nliability issue in a collection due process proceeding \nonly when she did not have an earlier opportunity to \ndo so. Plus, the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction is tied to the \nissues raised before, and determined by, the Appeals \nOffice in the first place. There\u2019s no risk that the Tax \nCourt will begin exercising free-wheeling jurisdiction \nover \u201cgeneral\u201d liability disputes. What\u2019s more, the \nquestion presented rarely arises, and when it does, it\u2019s \nonly because of \u201cthe IRS\u2019s own recalcitrance.\u201d \nBoechler, 596 U.S. at 207. So even if there were a \n\n20 \n \n \nfloodgates problem, it would be the government\u2019s own \ndoing. \nB. The government claims that the Tax Court \nlacks authority to issue a judgment regarding Zuch\u2019s \nentitlement to the estimated payments. In the govern-\nment\u2019s view, the Tax Court can enjoin only a collection \naction in a \u00a7 6330 proceeding, and can\u2019t issue declara-\ntory relief at all. That argument is meritless. \nSection 6330(d)(1) authorizes the Tax Court to deter-\nmine the taxpayer\u2019s unpaid tax and underlying \nliability, and issue a judgment about those issues. And \n\u00a7 6330(e)(1), which allows injunctions \u201cin respect of \nthe unpaid tax or proposed levy,\u201d confirms that the \nTax Court can issue declaratory relief determining a \ntaxpayer\u2019s rights in a challenge involving her liability \nor unpaid tax. The DJA doesn\u2019t provide otherwise, be-\ncause \u00a7 6330(e)(1) exempts \u00a7 6330 from the DJA\u2019s \nprohibition on declaratory relief in most tax cases.  \nC. The government\u2019s other mootness arguments \nfail, too. The government contends that the case is \nmoot because, once the IRS decides not to pursue a \nlevy, \u201cthe issue that prompted the Section 6330 pro-\nceeding is no longer \u2018live.\u2019\u201d Br. 21. But the mootness \ninquiry asks whether the parties retain any interest \nin the outcome of the litigation, and thus whether the \ncourt can redress the plaintiff\u2019s injury. The parties \nhave a concrete interest here, because the Tax Court \ncan decide whether Zuch or the IRS is entitled to the \nmoney.  \nD. Finally, the government mentions in a foot-\nnote that Zuch\u2019s challenge relates to her unpaid tax, \nrather than her underlying liability. But the govern-\nment concedes (Br. 25 n.3) that the dispute is \n\n21 \n \n \nimmaterial. Indeed, as Zuch has explained, the Tax \nCourt had, and retained, jurisdiction either way. \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe Tax Court had jurisdiction under I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330 to review and rule on Zuch\u2019s unpaid \ntax or tax liability, so the case isn\u2019t moot. \nA. The Tax Court had jurisdiction to review \nthe Appeals Office\u2019s determination of \nZuch\u2019s entitlement to the estimated \npayments. \nSection 6330\u2019s text and context make clear that \nthe Tax Court had jurisdiction to review Zuch\u2019s chal-\nlenge to her unpaid tax or underlying tax liability, \neven after the IRS stopped pursuing the levy. \n1. Section 6330\u2019s plain text states that \nthe Tax Court has jurisdiction to \nreview \nthe \nAppeals \nOffice\u2019s \n\u201cdetermination\u201d \nof \na \ntaxpayer\u2019s \nchallenge to \u201cany relevant issue \nrelating to [her] unpaid tax\u201d or her \n\u201cunderlying liability.\u201d  \na. During the collection due process hearing, the \nAppeals Office can determine \u201cany relevant issue re-\nlating to the unpaid tax,\u201d and, if the taxpayer \u201cdid not \nreceive any statutory notice of deficiency \u2026 or did not \notherwise have an opportunity to dispute\u201d it, the tax-\npayer may also challenge \u201cthe existence or amount of \nthe underlying tax liability.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2). A tax-\npayer challenges her underlying tax liability by \ndisputing \u201cthe amounts that the Commissioner as-\nsessed for a particular tax period.\u201d Jeffers v. \nCommissioner, 992 F.3d 649, 653 n.4 (7th Cir. 2021); \naccord Montgomery, 122 T.C. at 7-8. For example, the \n\n22 \n \n \ntaxpayer challenges her underlying tax liability when \nshe claims that the IRS misapplied a credit, if properly \napplying the credit \u201cwould eliminate the outstanding \ntax liability.\u201d Peoplease, LLC v. Commissioner, \nNo. 2161-24L, 2025 WL 429626, at *2 (T.C. Feb. 6, \n2025). Similarly, when a taxpayer raises challenges \nrelating to the unpaid portion of the underlying tax \nliability, she raises an issue related to the unpaid tax. \nSee Internal Revenue Service Chief Counsel Notice \nCC-2014-002 at 3 (May 5, 2014) (\u201c\u2018Unpaid tax\u2019 refers \nto that part of the underlying tax liability not paid by \nthe taxpayer.\u201d).  \nOnce the Appeals Office issues a determination, \nthe taxpayer may \u201cpetition the Tax Court for review \nof [the Appeals Office\u2019s] determination,\u201d \u201cand the Tax \nCourt shall have jurisdiction with respect to such mat-\nter.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). That means the Tax Court \nreviews the \u201cdetermination\u201d of all \u201cthe issues\u201d raised \nduring the hearing. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2), (c)(3)(B). So \nwhen the Tax Court reviews the Appeals Office\u2019s de-\ntermination, it can resolve any dispute about any \nissue relating to the unpaid tax or the taxpayer\u2019s un-\nderlying tax liability that the taxpayer properly raised \nbefore the Appeals Office. See id. \nb. The Tax Court doesn\u2019t lose its jurisdiction to \nresolve a challenge to the Appeals Office determina-\ntion just because the IRS decides to stop pursuing the \nlevy. Congress provided that the Tax Court \u201cshall \nhave jurisdiction\u201d to review the Appeals Office\u2019s deter-\nmination. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1) (emphasis added). That \nreview necessarily reaches all live \u201cissues\u201d involved in \nthe Appeal\u2019s Office\u2019s determination. And those issues \nexpressly include, as relevant here, \u201cany relevant is-\nsue relating to the unpaid tax\u201d and any \u201cchallenges to \nthe existence or amount of the underlying tax \n\n23 \n \n \nliability,\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2), (c)(3)(B). So long as an \nunpaid tax or liability issue remains disputed, nothing \nin \u00a7 6330 suggests the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to re-\nview the question vanishes when the IRS collects the \namount due another way and no longer needs the levy. \nAt most, whether there is a pending levy could affect \nwhat kind of relief the Tax Court can grant. But it \ndoesn\u2019t present any question about jurisdiction under \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1). As explained below (at 28-29), the Tax \nCourt can rule on a taxpayer\u2019s unpaid tax or underly-\ning liability when there are live disputes about those \nissues. \nc. Section 6330\u2019s history confirms that Congress \ndeliberately vested the Tax Court with jurisdiction to \nresolve disputes over a taxpayer\u2019s underlying liability \nand wanted the Tax Court to retain that jurisdiction. \nBefore 2006, \u00a7 6330 provided that taxpayers could \nseek review of the Appeals Office\u2019s determination in \nfederal district court \u201cif the Tax Court [did] not have \njurisdiction of the underlying tax liability.\u201d I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1) (2000). Practically, that language meant \nthat the Tax Court had jurisdiction to review the Ap-\npeals Office\u2019s determination of a liability dispute only \nif the dispute concerned income, estate, or gift taxes, \nbecause the Tax Court already had jurisdiction to re-\nview those kinds of disputes in deficiency proceedings. \nMoore v. Commissioner, 114 T.C. 171, 175 (2000). But \nCongress changed that in 2006 and made clear that \nthe Tax Court \u201cshall\u201d review the taxpayer\u2019s disputed \nliability in all cases. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). Thus, Con-\ngress ensured that \u201cthe Tax Court [has] jurisdiction \nover issues arising from a collection due process hear-\ning\u201d by \u201cconsolidat[ing] all judicial review of \u2026 \ncollection due process determinations,\u201d including a \ntaxpayer\u2019s underlying tax liability, in the Tax Court. \n\n24 \n \n \nStaff of J. Comm. on Taxation, 109th Cong., Descrip-\ntion of the Revenue Provisions Contained in the \nPresident\u2019s Fiscal Year 2007 Budget Proposal 230-31 \n(Comm. Print 2006); accord Staff of J. Comm. On Tax-\nation, 109th Cong., Technical Explanation of H.R. 4, \nThe \u201cPension Protection Act of 2006,\u201d as Passed By the \nHouse on July 28, 2006, and as Considered by the Sen-\nate on August 3, 2006 (Comm. Print. 2006). \n2. Statutory \ncontext \nconfirms \nthat \nCongress \ngave \nthe \nTax \nCourt \ncontinuing jurisdiction to resolve \nissues relating to the unpaid tax and \ntax liability disputes. \nStatutory context shows why Congress likely gave \nthe Tax Court authority to review the issues underly-\ning the Appeals Office\u2019s determination. \nAs noted (at 6-7), in some circumstances, the IRS \nissues a notice of deficiency to a taxpayer, who can \nthen challenge her assessed liability in Tax Court be-\nfore the IRS collects. See I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6212(a), 6512(a). \nBut sometimes the taxpayer doesn\u2019t receive a notice of \ndeficiency or have another opportunity to dispute the \nliability before the IRS seeks to levy the taxpayer\u2019s \nproperty, as in Zuch\u2019s case. See I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B). \nTo ensure that taxpayers have that opportunity, Con-\ngress gave taxpayers the right to dispute their \nliability. Id. Similarly, Congress gave taxpayers the \nright to raise \u201cany relevant issue relating to the un-\npaid tax,\u201d no matter whether they received a notice of \ndeficiency or otherwise had the opportunity to chal-\nlenge the liability. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A). And \nCongress directed the Appeals Office and Tax Court to \nresolve those challenges. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(3), (d)(1). \n\n25 \n \n \nEven if the IRS is able to terminate the levy after \nthe taxpayer initiates \u00a7 6330 proceedings, it makes \nsense for the Tax Court to finish resolving the unpaid \ntax or underlying liability dispute if it remains live. \nAfter all, if the dispute continues past the levy, closing \nthe Tax Court\u2019s doors would simply require the tax-\npayer to file another lawsuit, this time seeking a \nrefund under I.R.C. \u00a7 7422 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(a)(1). \nAnd that would undermine the \u201cdesign[]\u201d of the Tax \nCode \u201cto insure an orderly administration of the reve-\nnue.\u2019\u201d United States v. Clintwood Elkhorn Mining Co., \n553 U.S. 1, 11 (2008). It also would contravene the \ngovernment\u2019s fundamental obligation to \u201cturn square \ncorners in dealing with the people,\u201d Regents of the Uni-\nversity of California, 591 U.S. at 24, by pulling the rug \nout from under a taxpayer who has been litigating \nagainst the IRS for years and forcing her to start new \nlitigation in a different forum.  \nCongress passed \u00a7 6330 to avoid heavy-handed \nIRS tactics, not authorize them in the form of jurisdic-\ntional gamesmanship. And in what is known as the \nTaxpayer Bill of Rights, Congress has also instructed \nthe IRS to \u201censure that employees of the Internal Rev-\nenue Service are familiar with and act in accord with \ntaxpayer rights as afforded by other provisions of this \ntitle.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 7803(a)(3); see Taxpayer Bill of Rights, \nIRS, https://www.irs.gov/taxpayer-bill-of-rights (last \nvisited March 17, 2025). Those rights include \u201cthe \nright to pay no more than the correct amount of tax\u201d; \n\u201cthe right to challenge the position of the Internal \nRevenue Service and be heard\u201d; \u201cthe right to appeal a \ndecision of the Internal Revenue Service in an inde-\npendent forum\u201d; and \u201cthe right to finality.\u201d I.R.C. \n\u00a7 7803(a)(3)(C)-(F). Those rights underscore that the \nTax Court\u2019s jurisdiction under \u00a7 6330 does not vanish \n\n26 \n \n \njust because the IRS seeks to cut off the taxpayer\u2019s \nrights to challenge the agency\u2019s position. By the same \ntoken, nothing in I.R.C. \u00a7 6402, which governs offsets, \npurports to limit the Tax Court\u2019s authority to deter-\nmine the taxpayer\u2019s unpaid tax or liability under \n\u00a7 6330, and reading the provisions that way would in-\nsert words into the statute and contravene the \nTaxpayer Bill of Rights.  \n3. The Tax Court had jurisdiction under \n\u00a7 6330 to review the Appeals Office\u2019s \ndetermination, \nincluding \nits \nresolution of Zuch\u2019s entitlement to \nthe estimated payments. \nThe Tax Court had jurisdiction under \u00a7 6330 to re-\nview the Appeals Office\u2019s determination that Zuch \nwas not entitled to the estimated payments. \nZuch challenged the IRS\u2019s allocation of the esti-\nmated tax payments in the collection due process \nproceedings. In particular, she claimed that she did \nnot owe the IRS the $27,682 for the 2010 tax year be-\ncause the estimated payments should have been \ncredited to her. Pet. App. 9a; see Jeffers, 992 F.3d at \n653 n.4; Peoplease, 2025 WL 429626, at *2. Zuch had \na right to dispute that liability (or unpaid tax, if the \nIRS would prefer to classify it that way). Zuch did not \nreceive a notice of deficiency or otherwise have an op-\nportunity to challenge her claimed liability. Pet. \nApp. 10a. Regardless, Zuch was also entitled to raise \nher challenge as a \u201crelevant issue relating to the un-\npaid tax.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A).  \nAfter the Appeals Office made its determination, \nZuch timely petitioned the Tax Court for review. CA3 \nApp. A24-A30; see CA3 App. A266-270; Pet. App. 41a-\n42a. The Tax Court then had jurisdiction over the \n\n27 \n \n \nAppeals Office\u2019s decision, including the dispute over \nthe estimated payments. See I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2), \n(c)(3)(B), (d)(1). \nTo be sure, while the case was before the Tax \nCourt\u2014and after more than six years of litigation\u2014\nthe IRS announced that it was abandoning the levy. \nBut that didn\u2019t deprive the Tax Court of jurisdiction \nunder \u00a7 6330. Nothing in \u00a7 6330 purports to condition \nthe Tax Court\u2019s ongoing jurisdiction on the IRS\u2019s con-\ntinued pursuit of a levy. \nB. Zuch\u2019s case did not become moot when \nthe IRS decided to stop pursuing the \nlevy, because the parties disputed, and \nthe \nTax \nCourt \nhad \nthe \npower \nto \nadjudicate, Zuch\u2019s entitlement to the \nestimated payments. \nZuch\u2019s case isn\u2019t moot just because the IRS de-\ncided it no longer needed a levy. Mootness comes into \nplay only when the parties no longer have a concrete \ninterest in the outcome. But both Zuch and the IRS \nhave a concrete interest here because the Tax Court \ncan still decide Zuch\u2019s challenge to the Appeals Of-\nfice\u2019s \nunderlying \nliability \nor \nunpaid \ntax \ndeterminations and then rule that Zuch is entitled to \nthe estimated payments. If the Tax Court so rules, the \nIRS is likely to abide by that ruling and issue a refund. \nBut even if the IRS doesn\u2019t issue a refund, the Tax \nCourt\u2019s judgment would be preclusive in the refund \naction Zuch has brought in the District of New Jersey.  \n\n28 \n \n \n1. A case becomes moot only when the \nparties no longer have a concrete \ninterest \nin \nthe outcome \nof the \nlitigation and judicial relief is not \nlikely to redress any injury.  \nThe mootness inquiry asks whether standing \u201cex-\nists throughout the proceedings.\u201d Uzuegbunam v. \nPreczewski, 592 U.S. 279, 282 (2021). The \u201cirreducible \nconstitutional minimum of standing contains three el-\nements\u201d: \n(1) injury \nin \nfact, \n(2) causation \n(i.e., \ntraceability), and (3) redressability. Lujan v. Defend-\ners of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992). \u201cAs long \nas the parties have a concrete interest, however small, \nin the outcome of the litigation, the case is not moot.\u201d \nCampbell-Ewald Co. v. Gomez, 577 U.S. 153, 161 \n(2016). Thus, redressability requires only that judicial \nrelief \u201clikely\u201d will redress an injury, Federal Election \nCommission v. Cruz, 596 U.S. 289, 296 (2022), not \nthat \u201ca favorable decision will relieve\u201d \u201cevery injury,\u201d \nLarson v. Valente, 456 U.S. 228, 243-44 & n.15 (1982) \n(first emphasis added).  \n2. Zuch\u2019s challenge isn\u2019t moot because a \nfavorable \nTax \nCourt \nruling \non \nunderlying liability or unpaid tax \nwould likely redress her pocketbook \ninjury. \nZuch satisfies all three requirements of standing. \nShe suffered a concrete injury when the IRS applied \nthe $50,000 in estimated payments to her ex-hus-\nband\u2019s balance, rather than her own. See, e.g., \nTransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413, 425 \n(2021). If the IRS had applied the estimated payments \nto Zuch\u2019s account\u2014as both she and her ex-husband \nhad \nrequested\u2014Zuch \nwould \nhave \ngotten \nher \n\n29 \n \n \noverpayments back in later years. But, having refused \nto apply the estimated payments to Zuch\u2019s tax bill, the \nIRS kept her overpayments instead. Zuch\u2019s monetary \ninjury is thus traceable to the IRS\u2019s refusal to apply \nthe $50,000 in estimated payments to her 2010 tax \nbill. See Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Or-\nganization, 426 U.S. 26, 41-42 (1976). And the Tax \nCourt can redress Zuch\u2019s injury by ruling that the Ap-\npeals Office was wrong about her liability or unpaid \ntax and thus determining that Zuch is entitled to the \n$50,000 in estimated payments. \nAs noted, the Appeals Office\u2019s \u201cdetermination\u201d \n\u201cshall take into consideration\u201d \u201cthe issues raised\u201d at \nthe hearing, I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(3)(B), including \u201cany rel-\nevant issue relating to the unpaid tax\u201d and \u201cthe \nexistence or amount of the underlying tax liability,\u201d \nI.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2). And because the Tax Court \u201cshall \nhave jurisdiction\u201d to review \u201csuch determination,\u201d \nI.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1), the Tax Court can decide a tax-\npayer\u2019s unpaid tax or underlying tax liability, too. \nAccord Michael I. Saltzman & Leslie Book, IRS Prac-\ntice & Procedure \u00a7 14B.16[4][a] (updated Oct. 2024). \nIn Zuch\u2019s case, that means the Tax Court can rule on \nwhether she is entitled to credit for the estimated pay-\nments, underscoring both parties\u2019 concrete interest in \nthe outcome of the case. See Pet. App. 33a-34a, 42a. \nIf the Tax Court rules that Zuch is entitled to the \nestimated payments, the IRS is likely to issue Zuch a \nrefund. That\u2019s because \u201cit is substantially likely that \n[the IRS] would abide by\u201d that \u201cauthoritative\u201d holding \n\u201cby the [Tax] Court.\u201d Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 \nU.S. 788, 803 (1992); accord Reed v. Goertz, 598 U.S. \n230, 234 (2023); Pet. App. 38a. Indeed, it would be \nquite remarkable for the IRS to simply ignore the Tax \nCourt and decide not to return to Zuch the money that \n\n30 \n \n \na court has determined the IRS has no legal right to \nkeep. That is especially true because the Tax Court \nnot only has authority to review and rule on the un-\nderlying \nliability \nand \nunpaid \ntax \nissues \nin \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1), but it also has authority to put those rul-\nings into a declaratory judgment under \u00a7 6330(e), as \nexplained below (at 40-42). The consequence is that \nthe Tax Court will have \u201c\u2018ordered a change in a legal \nstatus,\u2019 and \u2018the practical consequence of that change \nwould amount to a significant increase in the likeli-\nhood\u2019\u201d that the IRS will give Zuch her money back. \nReed, 598 U.S. at 234. The Tax Court\u2019s authority to \nissue a \u201cdefinitive determination of the legal rights of \nthe parties,\u201d Medtronic, Inc. v. Mirowski Family Ven-\ntures, LLC, 571 U.S. 191, 200 (2014); see Haaland v. \nBrackeen, 599 U.S. 255, 293 (2023), leaves no doubt \nthat the court has the power to grant effective relief. \nEven if the IRS doesn\u2019t issue Zuch a refund, Zuch \nhas filed a refund suit in the District of New Jersey \nunder I.R.C. \u00a7 7422, and the Tax Court\u2019s ruling would \nhave preclusive effect in that suit. \u201cUnder the doctrine \nof issue preclusion, \u2018a prior judgment forecloses suc-\ncessive litigation of an issue of fact or law actually \nlitigated and resolved in a valid court determination \nessential to the prior judgment.\u2019\u201d Herrera v. Wyoming, \n587 U.S. 329, 342 (2019) (alterations adopted). \u201cThe \nidea is straightforward: Once a court has decided an \nissue, it is \u2018forever settled as between the parties.\u2019\u201d \nB&B Hardware, Inc. v. Hargis Industries, Inc., 575 \nU.S. 138, 147 (2015). That goes for declaratory relief \nissued in an earlier case, too. E.g., 18 Charles A. \nWright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Pro-\ncedure \u00a7 4421 (3d ed. updated June 2024). And the \ndoctrine applies \u201ceven if the issue recurs in the context \n\n31 \n \n \nof a different claim.\u201d Taylor v. Sturgell, 553 U.S. 880, \n892 (2008). \nHere, Zuch\u2019s entitlement to the estimated pay-\nments is an \u201cissue of \u2026 law\u201d that would be \u201cactually \nlitigated and resolved\u201d in the Tax Court proceeding \nand \u201cessential to\u201d the Tax Court\u2019s decision on Zuch\u2019s \nunpaid tax or underlying liability. Herrera, 587 U.S. \nat 342. Thus, the Tax Court\u2019s judgment would be pre-\nclusive in the refund suit Zuch has recently filed in the \nDistrict of New Jersey, and that court likely would or-\nder the government to issue a refund. See, e.g., \nParklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 U.S. 322, 325, 332-\n33 (1979). \nII. The IRS\u2019s counterarguments lack merit. \nA. The Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to review \nwhether Zuch was entitled to the \nprepayments didn\u2019t dissolve once the \nIRS no longer needed the levy. \nThe government claims (Br. 16-21), that the Tax \nCourt has jurisdiction under \u00a7 6330 to review a tax-\npayer\u2019s liability only if the IRS continues threatening \nto levy the taxpayer\u2019s property. In the government\u2019s \nview, \u00a7 6330\u2019s text, history, and \u201cfunction\u201d show that \n\u00a7 6330 focuses only on whether a levy can proceed, and \nthe Tax Court thus lacks jurisdiction when the IRS \ndecides it no longer needs a levy. The government also \nwarns that allowing the Tax Court to review live dis-\nputes about unpaid tax or taxpayer liability when no \nlevy is pending would vastly expand Tax Court juris-\ndiction. Those arguments fail. Section 6330\u2019s text, \nhistory, and remedial purpose, plus time-of-filing \nrules in other contexts, all confirm that the Tax Court \nretains jurisdiction under \u00a7 6330 to review a tax-\npayer\u2019s unpaid tax or underlying liability, even when \n\n32 \n \n \nthe IRS abandons its levy. And the government\u2019s pol-\nicy concern is meritless. \n1. There is no textual basis in \u00a7 6330 for \nthe \ngovernment\u2019s \ncontinuing-levy \nrequirement. \na. The government contends that without a \nthreatened levy, there is nothing for the \u201cunderlying \ntax liability\u201d to \u201cunderlie.\u201d Br. 26. So by implication, \nthe government claims, \u00a7 6330 jurisdiction turns on a \nthreatened levy. Br. 24-27. That argument fails. \nSection 6330(d)(1) makes clear that the Tax Court \nhas jurisdiction in \u00a7 6330 proceedings to review the \nAppeals Office\u2019s determination of the issues raised in \na collection due process hearing. Supra pp. 21-23. It \nsays that \u201cthe Tax Court shall have jurisdiction\u201d to re-\nview the Appeals Office\u2019s \u201cdetermination\u201d\u2014which \nincludes all the issues the Appeals Office was required \nto consider during the hearing, not just whether the \nlevy can proceed. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1); see I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(c)(2), (c)(3)(B). The \u201cunderlying liability\u201d lan-\nguage appears in the provisions of \u00a7 6330 listing the \nmatters a taxpayer may raise at the collection due pro-\ncess hearing. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B). The Appeals \nOffice\u2019s determination thus triggers the Tax Court\u2019s \njurisdiction under \u00a7 6330, and the IRS\u2019s actions after \nthe Appeals Office issues the determination have no \nbearing on that jurisdiction. \nWhat\u2019s more, even assuming the phrase \u201cunderly-\ning tax liability\u201d implies that there must be a proposed \nlevy at the outset of the collection due process hearing \n(and there was here), nothing in \u00a7 6330 conditions the \nTax Court\u2019s exercise of \u00a7 6330 jurisdiction on the IRS\u2019s \ncontinued pursuit of a levy. To the contrary, \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1) refers to the Tax Court\u2019s review of a \n\n33 \n \n \n\u201cdetermination\u201d by the Appeals Office. And even if \n\u00a7 6330 required a pending levy at the outset of Tax \nCourt proceedings, that requirement would be satis-\nfied because there was a threatened levy pending \nwhen Zuch petitioned the Tax Court. Infra pp. 38-39. \nThat makes sense. Zuch continues to be aggrieved by \nthe Appeals Office\u2019s determination upholding the \nIRS\u2019s liability assessment, even though the IRS claims \nit no longer needs the levy. \nViewing Zuch\u2019s challenge as one \u201crelating to the \nunpaid tax\u201d doesn\u2019t mean the Tax Court lost jurisdic-\ntion to review the dispute, either. That\u2019s because the \n$27,682 the IRS claims Zuch owed for the 2010 tax \nyear was \u201cunpaid\u201d when she petitioned the Tax Court \nin 2014. See Pet. App. 11a. \nb. The government also claims that the text of \n\u00a7 6330 is \u201cnarrowly focused\u201d on \u201cwhether the IRS may \ngo forward with its proposed levy,\u201d from the title for \nthe section to the provisions describing the beginning \nof collection due process proceedings and granting the \nTax Court jurisdiction. Br. 17; see Br. 17-20. Not so. \nFor starters, the title of a provision is \u201cnot meant \nto take the place of the detailed provisions of the text\u201d; \nnor is it \u201cnecessarily designed to be a reference guide \nor a synopsis.\u201d Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. \nBaltimore & Ohio Railroad Co., 331 U.S. 519, 528 \n(1947). What\u2019s more, even though a taxpayer can ini-\ntiate collection due process proceedings with the \nAppeals Office when the IRS seeks to levy, see I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(a)(1), the provisions that authorize the Tax \nCourt to review a taxpayer\u2019s liability challenge\u2014\n\u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B) and (d)(1)\u2014do not \u201cfocus[] on\u201d a levy. \nSection 6330(c)(2)(B), for instance, allows taxpayers in \nsome situations to \u201craise at the hearing challenges to \n\n34 \n \n \nthe existence or amount of the underlying tax liabil-\nity.\u201d And \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A) differentiates \u201crelevant \nissue[s] relating to the unpaid tax\u201d from issues about \n\u201cthe proposed levy.\u201d Section 6330(d)(1), moreover, \nstates that the taxpayer may \u201cpetition the Tax Court \nfor review of such determination (and the Tax Court \nshall have jurisdiction with respect to such matter).\u201d \nNo continuing-levy requirement there. \nc. Next, the government says that \u00a7 6330(d)(1)\u2019s \nreference to the Appeals Office\u2019s \u201cdetermination\u201d im-\nplies that Tax Court jurisdiction hinges on a \nthreatened levy because the \u201cdetermination\u201d is about \nonly \u201cwhether the levy may go forward.\u201d Br. 19-20. \nThat\u2019s wrong, too. Section 6330(d)(1) authorizes the \nTax Court to review that \u201cdetermination,\u201d which nec-\nessarily involves reviewing the Appeals Office\u2019s \nresolution of each issue raised at the collection due \nprocess hearing. Supra pp. 21-23. That includes, \nwhere relevant, the taxpayer\u2019s unpaid tax or underly-\ning liability, see I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2), (c)(3)(B)\u2014\ndeterminations, as this very case shows, with signifi-\ncance beyond whether a levy may proceed. Those \nrulings determine who keeps the money both parties \nclaim is legally theirs. And as the government admits \n(Br. 19-20), the Tax Court\u2019s resolution of those issues \nis part and parcel of the determination. Nothing in \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1) conditions the Tax Court\u2019s review of that \ndetermination\u2014and all the issues it resolves\u2014on a \ncontinuing levy. \nd. The government\u2019s atextual continuing-levy re-\nquirement fails for another reason: \u201cthe presumption \nfavoring judicial review of administrative action,\u201d \nGuerrero-Lasprilla, 589 U.S. at 229, weighs in favor of \nTax Court jurisdiction. The \u201cstrong presumption\u201d of \njudicial review directs that \u201cwhen a statutory \n\n35 \n \n \nprovision \u2018is reasonably susceptible to divergent inter-\npretation,\u2019\u201d courts must \u201cadopt the reading that \naccords with traditional understandings and basic \nprinciples: that executive determinations generally \nare subject to judicial review.\u201d Id. And where applica-\nble, the \u201cpresumption can only be overcome by \u2018clear \nand convincing evidence\u2019 of congressional intent to \npreclude judicial review.\u201d Id. Those principles also \nalign with this Court\u2019s recent recognition in the \u00a7 6330 \ncontext that jurisdictional requirements must be \n\u201cclearly state[d].\u201d Boechler, 596 U.S. at 203. \nHere, \u00a7 6330 is susceptible to one interpretation: \nthe Tax Court retains jurisdiction to review a deter-\nmination even if the IRS says it no longer needs the \nlevy. Supra pp. 21-26. Section 6330(d)(1) doesn\u2019t men-\ntion levies, much less contain a clear continuing-levy \nrequirement. But even if another reasonable interpre-\ntation were possible, it is far from clear that Congress \nintended to insulate the Appeals Office\u2019s unpaid tax \nand liability determinations when the IRS stops pur-\nsuing a levy. See Pet. Br. 34. \nThe presumption doesn\u2019t become irrelevant here \njust because Zuch can file a refund suit and obtain ju-\ndicial review of her entitlement to the estimated \npayments that way, as the government contends (id.). \nThe \u201cadministrative action\u201d at issue here is the Ap-\npeals Office\u2019s determination. Guerrero-Lasprilla, 589 \nU.S. at 229. So the question is whether that determi-\nnation is reviewable in the Tax Court under \u00a7 6330\u2014\nnot whether Zuch may obtain review of another ac-\ntion, in a different court, and under a different Code \nprovision. The presumption applies in answering the \nformer question. And the answer is that the Tax Court \nretains jurisdiction. \n\n36 \n \n \n2. The \ngovernment \nmisconstrues \n\u00a7 6330\u2019s history and downplays its \nremedial \npurpose, \nwhich \nboth \nsupport \nthe \nTax \nCourt\u2019s \n\u00a7 6330 \njurisdiction to review unpaid tax and \nliability disputes even if the IRS no \nlonger pursues the levy. \nThe government claims (Br. 22-23) that because \nCongress added \u00a7 6330 in 1998 to allow taxpayers to \nchallenge levies before the IRS seized their property, \nthat somehow shows that the Tax Court has jurisdic-\ntion only if a levy is pending. But that argument \ncannot trump plain text. And in any event, \u00a7 6330\u2019s \nhistory and purpose confirm that Congress wanted \nthe Tax Court to retain jurisdiction over a live unpaid \ntax or liability dispute even if the IRS no longer needs \na levy. \nCongress enacted \u00a7 6330 to protect taxpayers from \nthe IRS\u2019s abusive collection practices and to rein in the \nIRS\u2019s unchecked power to act as \u201cjudge, jury, and exe-\ncutioner, answerable to none.\u201d Hearings Before the \nCommittee on Finance at 56, 82; see supra pp. 9-10. \nAnd in designing \u00a7 6330\u2019s scheme, Congress sought to \n\u201censure that all taxpayers have due process and that \nthe IRS does not abusively use its liens-and-seizure \nauthority.\u201d 143 Cong. Rec. S12231 (statement of Sen. \nRoth). Indeed, the point of \u00a7 6330 proceedings is to \u201cin-\ncrease fairness to taxpayers\u201d before the IRS deprives \nthem of their property. S. Rep. No. 105-174, at 67; ac-\ncord Katz v. Commissioner, 115 T.C. 329, 333 n.8 \n(2000) (explaining that Congress enacted \u00a7 6330 \u201cto \nprovide new protections for taxpayers\u201d). \nSection 6330 did just that. It gave taxpayers a \nchance to challenge their liability before paying it \n\n37 \n \n \nwhen the taxpayer did not already have an oppor-\ntunity to challenge the liability, and ensured \ntaxpayers may always raise \u201cany relevant issue relat-\ning to the unpaid tax.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2). Section \n6330 thus gave taxpayers an opportunity for IRS Ap-\npeals to reach a \u201cdetermination\u201d on their unpaid tax \nor liability, and granted taxpayers the right \u201cto peti-\ntion the Tax Court to contest the Appeals [Office\u2019s] \ndecision,\u201d 144 Cong. Rec. S4494 (statement of Sen. \nHatch). Put simply, history shows that Congress did \nnot intend to enable the IRS to unilaterally deprive \nthe Tax Court of jurisdiction to review unpaid tax or \nliability disputes by finding another way to take the \ntaxpayer\u2019s money and then claiming it no longer seeks \nthe levy. And given \u00a7 6330\u2019s history, the Court should \nconstrue the statute \u201cbroadly to effectuate its pur-\nposes.\u201d Tcherepnin v. Knight, 389 U.S. 332, 336 (1967); \nsee Piedmont & Northern Railway. v. Interstate Com-\nmerce Commission, 286 U.S. 299, 311 (1932). \n3. Royal \nCanin \ndoesn\u2019t \nhelp \nthe \ngovernment. \nPointing to this Court\u2019s decision in Royal Canin, \nthe government argues that \u00a7 6330 contains a contin-\nuing-levy requirement because the IRS \u201calter[s]\u201d \n\u201c[t]he fundamental basis\u201d of the suit when it decides \nto no longer seek the levy. Br. 29-31. That argument \nfails. \nIn Royal Canin, the Court held that, if a plaintiff \namends her complaint to \u201celiminate[] the federal-law \nclaims that enabled removal, leaving only state-law \nclaims behind, the court\u2019s power to decide the dispute \ndissolves.\u201d 604 U.S. at 30. That makes sense, given the \nbasic idea that \u201c[i]f a plaintiff amends her complaint, \nthe new pleading \u2018supersedes\u2019 the old one.\u201d Id. at 35 \n\n38 \n \n \n(citing 6 Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice \nand Procedure \u00a7 1476 (3d ed. 2010)). And in Royal \nCanin, the plaintiff altered the basis for the federal \ncourt\u2019s federal question jurisdiction by amending her \ncomplaint to withdraw her federal claims.  \nNone of those principles shows that the Tax Court \nlost jurisdiction under \u00a7 6330 to review the Appeals \nOffice\u2019s determination when the IRS stopped pursuing \nthe levy. The basis of the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction un-\nder \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1) \nis \nthe \nAppeals \nOffice\u2019s \ndetermination\u2014not the proposed levy. The IRS did \nnot change the basis of the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction by \ndropping the levy, because once the Appeals Office is-\nsues a \u201cdetermination,\u201d the Tax Court has jurisdiction \nto review it. See I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1) (\u201cthe Tax Court \nshall have jurisdiction\u201d to \u201creview\u201d the \u201cdetermina-\ntion\u201d). And unlike the plaintiff in Royal Canin, Zuch \ndidn\u2019t file an amended pleading changing the basis of \nthe Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction. When Zuch filed her Tax \nCourt petition, she challenged the Appeals Office\u2019s de-\ntermination that she was not entitled to the estimated \npayments. That\u2019s still her challenge today, and the \nIRS\u2019s decision to stop pursuing the levy is irrelevant.  \nBut even assuming the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction \nunder \u00a7 6330 was somehow contingent on a levy, time-\nof-filing rules show that any levy requirement was \nmet because there was a pending levy when Zuch pe-\ntitioned the Tax Court. Time-of-filing rules generally \nprovide that jurisdiction \u201cdepends upon the state of \nthings at the time\u201d the plaintiff brings the action, \nGrupo Dataflux v. Atlas Global Group, L.P., 541 U.S. \n567, 570 (2004); see, e.g., Conolly v. Taylor, 27 U.S. (2 \nPet.) 556, 565 (1829)\u2014here, when the taxpayer peti-\ntions the Tax Court. So, if \u00a7 6330 did require a pending \nlevy, that levy requirement would be assessed at the \n\n39 \n \n \ntime the taxpayer files her Tax Court petition. And \nhere, there was a pending levy when Zuch petitioned \nthe Tax Court. Pet. App. 11a, 13a. The IRS\u2019s decision \nto stop pursuing the levy thus does not destroy the Tax \nCourt\u2019s jurisdiction to review the Appeals Office\u2019s de-\ntermination, even if \u00a7 6330 contains a levy-based \njurisdictional requirement. \n4. The government\u2019s policy argument is \nmeritless. \nThe government claims that, if it cannot deprive \nthe Tax Court of jurisdiction to review a liability chal-\nlenge by no longer seeking the levy, \u00a7 6330 will turn \ninto a \u201cgeneral forum for considering challenges to tax \nliability.\u201d Br. 24. That argument lacks merit. \nThere\u2019s no risk of the Tax Court wading into gen-\neral liability determinations in \u00a7 6330 proceedings. \nSection 6330 specifies the issues taxpayers may raise \nin \ncollection \ndue \nprocess \nhearings. \nI.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A). And only taxpayers who did not have \nan earlier opportunity to challenge their assessed lia-\nbility can challenge that claimed liability in collection \ndue process proceedings. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B). The \nTax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to review the taxpayer\u2019s lia-\nbility (or issue relating to the unpaid tax), in turn, is \ntied to the Appeals Office\u2019s liability determination. \nI.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). The sky isn\u2019t falling, and the gov-\nernment hasn\u2019t pointed to any \u00a7 6330 cases pending \nbefore the Appeals Office or the Tax Court that would \nsuggest otherwise. \nWhat\u2019s more, the question presented in this case \narises rarely, and when it does, it\u2019s only as a result of \n\u201cthe IRS\u2019s own recalcitrance.\u201d Boechler, 596 U.S. at \n207. The question arises only when the IRS initiates a \nlevy, but during \u00a7 6330 proceedings, finds a way to \n\n40 \n \n \ntake the taxpayer\u2019s money another way, and drops the \nlevy during the Tax Court\u2019s review. But there\u2019s no rea-\nson to think the issue comes up with any frequency. \nB. The Tax Court\u2019s authority is not limited \nto approving or rejecting a proposed \nlevy, but includes the power to issue \nbinding judgments. \nThe government argues that the Tax Court \ndoesn\u2019t have the power to declare Zuch\u2019s entitlement \nto the estimated payments. In the government\u2019s view, \n\u00a7 6330 doesn\u2019t authorize that relief, the DJA\u2019s prohi-\nbition on declaratory relief in most tax cases bars \nbinding relief here, and \u00a7 6330 is a \u201climited mecha-\nnism\u201d for either allowing or disallowing a levy. Br. 23-\n24, 27-29. Those arguments are meritless. \nFirst, \u00a7 6330(d)(1) authorizes the Tax Court to de-\ntermine whether the estimated payments should have \ncovered the amount the IRS assessed for the 2010 tax \nyear, no matter whether there is a pending levy. \nThat\u2019s because the Tax Court \u201cshall have jurisdiction\u201d \nto \u201creview\u201d the Appeals Office\u2019s determination of the \ntaxpayer\u2019s underlying liability or issues relating to \nher unpaid tax. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B), (d)(1). And that \nmeans the Tax Court can issue a ruling resolving \nZuch\u2019s liability or issues relating to the unpaid tax. \nThe IRS is expected to abide by that ruling, and in-\ndeed, that ruling will have preclusive effect. Supra \npp. 28-31. \nSecond, \u00a7 6330(e)(1) confirms that the Tax Court \ncan issue its ruling in the form of declaratory relief. \nThat provision authorizes injunctive relief in \u00a7 6330 \nproceedings, which necessarily means it also author-\nizes declaratory relief. That\u2019s because an injunction \nnecessarily rests on a declaration. Indeed, an \n\n41 \n \n \ninjunction prohibiting an act incorporates \u201ca judicial \ndeclaration that [the act] is illegal,\u201d Pet. App. 36a. \nAnd as this Court has recognized, declaratory relief is \na \u201cmilder\u201d alternative to an injunction. Steffel v. \nThompson, 415 U.S. 452, 466-67 (1974). Thus, the Tax \nCourt\u2019s authority to issue an injunction under \n\u00a7 6330(e)(1) includes the authority to issue declara-\ntory relief. \nResisting that conclusion, the government asserts \nthat \u00a7 6330(e)(1) can\u2019t authorize declaratory relief be-\ncause it limits injunctive authority to \u201ca specific \ncollection action.\u201d Br. 28-29. Not so. Section 6330(e)(1) \nauthorizes the Tax Court to enjoin \u201cany action or pro-\nceeding\u201d if: (1) \u201ca timely appeal has been filed under \nsubsection (d)(1),\u201d and (2) the injunction is \u201cin respect \nof the unpaid tax or proposed levy to which the deter-\nmination being appealed relates.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(e)(1); \nsee I.R.C. \u00a7 7421(a). And if the Tax Court can issue an \ninjunction \u201cin respect of the unpaid tax or proposed \nlevy,\u201d it can also decide the taxpayer\u2019s liability that \ngave rise to both the unpaid tax and the proposed levy.  \nThird, the DJA doesn\u2019t withdraw the Tax Court\u2019s \nauthority to issue declaratory relief. That statute au-\nthorizes federal courts to \u201cdeclare the rights and other \nlegal relations of any interested party seeking such \ndeclaration,\u201d \u201cexcept with respect to Federal taxes.\u201d 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2201(a). But courts have uniformly held that \nthe DJA must be read together with the Tax Code and \nthe AIA, I.R.C. \u00a7 7421(a). And that means the DJA \ndoes not prohibit declaratory relief where those other \nprovisions permit injunctions. E.g., Cohen v. United \nStates, 650 F.3d 717, 727-28 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (en banc); \nCIC Services, LLC v. Internal Revenue Service, 925 \nF.3d 247, 250 n.3 (6th Cir. 2019), rev\u2019d on other \ngrounds 593 U.S. 209 (2021); see Bob Jones University \n\n42 \n \n \nv. Simon, 416 U.S. 725, 732 n.7 (1974). Both the plain \ntext of \u00a7 6330(d)(1) and (e)(1) and the AIA, I.R.C. \n\u00a7 7421(a), authorize injunctions in \u00a7 6330 proceed-\nings, so declaratory relief is authorized as well. \nFinally, as explained (at 32-35), \u00a7 6330 isn\u2019t just \nabout whether a levy can proceed or not, so the Tax \nCourt\u2019s authority is not limited to deciding whether or \nnot a levy can proceed, either. Instead, Congress en-\nacted \u00a7 6330 to create a meaningful exception to what \nthe government says is the Tax Code\u2019s historical \u201cpay \nnow, dispute later\u201d framework. See Pet. Br. 2. It did so \nby allowing taxpayers to challenge the unpaid tax and \ntheir liability before they decide to pay or the IRS lev-\nies their property. And as \u00a7 6330\u2019s history confirms, \nthe Tax Court retains jurisdiction under \u00a7 6330 to re-\nview the Appeals Office\u2019s determination of her unpaid \ntax or tax liability, so it can issue binding relief resolv-\ning those issues, too. Supra pp. 23-24, 36-37. \nC. The government\u2019s claim that the parties \nlack a legally cognizable interest in the \ncase once the IRS decides not to move \nforward with the levy is incorrect. \nUnable to show that its actions deprived the Tax \nCourt of \u00a7 6330 jurisdiction, the IRS next contends \n(Br. 21), that the case is moot because once the IRS \ndecides it doesn\u2019t need a levy, the parties lack a legally \ncognizable interest. That is so, the IRS says, because \neven if \u201cthe IRS has made an error or continues to owe \n[the taxpayer] money,\u201d there\u2019s no threatened levy, and \nthe levy is \u201cthe issue that prompted\u201d the collection due \nprocess hearing. Id. That argument fails. \nThe question isn\u2019t whether \u201cthe issue that \nprompted\u201d a collection due process hearing is live. Ra-\nther, \u201c[a]s long as the parties have a concrete interest, \n\n43 \n \n \nhowever small, in the outcome of the litigation,\u201d the \ncase is not moot. Campbell-Ewald Co., 577 U.S. at \n161. And as explained, Zuch has a concrete interest in \nthe outcome of the litigation because the Tax Court \ncan adjudicate her unpaid tax or underlying liability \nby determining her right to the estimated payments, \nand therefore to a refund. Accord Saltzman & Book, \nsupra, \u00a7 14B.16[4][a]. That ruling would also be pre-\nclusive in the refund action Zuch has brought in the \nDistrict of New Jersey under I.R.C. \u00a7 7422. The IRS \nhas a concrete interest, too: if the Tax Court decides \nthat Zuch is not entitled to the estimated payments, \nthe IRS keeps her money. It is thus not \u201cimpossible for \na court to grant any effectual relief what[so]ever\u201d to \nwhomever prevails. Chafin v. Chafin, 568 U.S. 165, \n172 (2013). \nD. Whether Zuch\u2019s challenge is a dispute \nabout an unpaid tax or underlying \nliability is immaterial. \nIn a footnote, the government claims that Zuch\u2019s \nchallenge presents \u201can issue relating to [her] unpaid \ntax,\u201d rather than her tax liability. Br. 25 n.3. But, as \nthe government concedes, whether Zuch\u2019s challenge is \nabout an unpaid tax or underlying liability is immate-\nrial. Id. (\u201cThe Court need not \u2026 decide this dispute to \nresolve the question presented.\u201d). The difference \ndoesn\u2019t matter because, as explained (at 26-27), even \nif Zuch\u2019s challenge is one related to an \u201cunpaid tax,\u201d \nthe Tax Court still had jurisdiction. That\u2019s because \nZuch\u2019s challenge to her unpaid tax would still have \nbeen part of the Appeals Office\u2019s \u201cdetermination\u201d that \nwas reviewable by the Tax Court. Id. \nIn any event, the Appeals Office itself considered \nZuch to be challenging her underlying tax liability. \n\n44 \n \n \nPet. App. 48a, 66a. Indeed, she disputed whether she \nowed \u201cthe amounts that the Commissioner assessed \nfor [the 2010] tax period,\u201d Jeffers, 992 F.3d at 653 n.4, \nbecause she argued the estimated payments should \nhave been applied to her, see Peoplease, 2025 WL \n429626, at *2. Supra p. 26. And, in the IRS\u2019s own view, \n\u201cunpaid tax\u201d is just the unpaid portion of the \u201cunder-\nlying tax liability\u201d anyway. Internal Revenue Service \nChief Counsel Notice CC-2014-002 at 3. \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should affirm the judgment of the court \nof appeals and remand for further proceedings. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nRaza Rasheed \nSKADDEN, ARPS, SLATE,  \n  MEAGHER & FLOM LLP \n2000 Ave. of the Stars, \n  Ste. 200N \nLos Angeles, CA 90067 \n \nFrank Agostino \nAGOSTINO & \n  ASSOCIATES, P.C.  \n14 Washington Place \nHackensack, NJ 07601 \n \nShay Dvoretzky \n  Counsel of Record \nParker Rider-Longmaid \nArmando Gomez \nSylvia O.

Lavar Taylor is a tax controversy \npractitioner with over 43 years of experience in \nhandling \njudicial \nand \nadministrative \ntax \ncontroversies. His experience includes working for the \nDepartment of Justice as an Assistant United States \nAttorney in the Tax Division of the United States \nAttorney\u2019s Office for the Central District of California, \nas a Senior Attorney for the Internal Revenue Service \n(\u201cIRS\u201d) Office of Chief Counsel, and for taxpayers as \nan attorney in private practice. Mr. Taylor is an \nAdjunct Professor at the Chapman Fowler School of \nLaw where he teaches Federal Tax Procedure, and \nhas served as an Adjunct Professor of Law at the \nUniversity of California, Irvine, School of Law. Mr. \nTaylor and his firm have represented taxpayers in \nmany hundreds of Collection Due Process appeals at \nthe administrative level and in many Collection Due \nProcess cases at the judicial level. Mr. Taylor has been \npersonally involved as a private practitioner in over \n300 cases brought in the U.S. Tax Court (\u201cTax \nCourt\u201d), and has personally been involved in \nnumerous additional tax-related cases in the U.S. \n \n1 No person other than the named Amicus or their counsel \nauthored this Brief or provided financial support for this Brief. \n\n2 \n \n \n \nDistrict Courts (\u201cDistrict Courts\u201d), U.S. Courts of \nAppeal, and this Court as a private practitioner. \nAmicus is filing this brief in support of \nRespondent  Jennifer Zuch.2 The question presented \nin this case is important from the standpoint of tax \nadministration, although the specific outcome of this \nappeal will affect only a narrow subset of taxpayers.  \nIn 1998, Congress explicitly granted taxpayers \nthe right  to challenge the \u201cexistence or amount\u201d of tax \nliabilities in administrative and judicial Collection \nDue Process proceedings brought pursuant to 26 \nU.S.C. \u00a76330 if the taxpayer \u201cdid not receive any \nstatutory notice of deficiency for such tax liability or \ndid not otherwise have an opportunity to dispute such \ntax liability.\u201d See, e.g., Montgomery v. Commissioner, \n122 T.C. 1 (2004) (taxpayer allowed to challenge the \namount of an unpaid liability shown on a \u201cbalance \ndue\u201d personal income tax return).  \nThis was a dramatic change from existing law. \nPrior to the enactment of \u00a76330,  taxpayers against \nwhom the IRS assessed unpaid liabilities without \nfirst issuing a notice of deficiency could generally \ninitiate a judicial challenge to  a disputed liability \n \n2 Amicus regularly represents clients of the type whose interests \ncould be affected by the outcome of this case, but Amicus has not \nbeen retained by any client (or by any third party) for the \npurpose of filing this Brief as Amicus Curiae. \n\n3 \n \n \n \nonly by paying the disputed liability in full, filing a \nclaim for refund, and then filing suit for refund in \nFederal District Court or the Court of Federal Claims. \nSee generally Flora v. United States, 362 U.S. 145 \n(1960). Under prior law, taxpayers such as the \ntaxpayer in Montgomery would have had to pay the \ntax in full, file a claim for refund, and then file suit to \nrecover the refund in District Court or the Court of \nFederal Claims to challenge the \u201cexistence or amount\u201d \nof the unpaid tax debt. Id. That is no longer the case. \nThis significant new opportunity for taxpayers \nto judicially challenge the merits of a disputed \nliability was prompted by a Congressional perception \nthat the IRS was treating taxpayers unfairly, forcing \ntaxpayers to endure hardships in order to pay \ndisputed liabilities that ultimately were not owed. See \nBrief for Respondent at pp. 9-10, 36-37. To remedy the \nperceived unfair treatment of taxpayers, Congress \nchanged the law by giving taxpayers the right to \njudicially challenge the existence or amount of a tax \nliability in what are now called Collection Due \nProcess appeals if the taxpayers did not receive a \nnotice of deficiency or did not otherwise have an \nopportunity to challenge a disputed tax liability. \nThe IRS here improperly asks this Court to \nimpose limitations on an important right granted to \ntaxpayers by Congress.  The limitations requested by \nIRS have no statutory basis and make no practical \nsense.  Furthermore, the IRS agrees that the Tax \n\n4 \n \n \n \nCourt had jurisdiction to decide the dispute regarding \nthe tax liability at issue at the time the Tax Court \npetition was filed and yet argues that the taxpayer\u2019s \nsubsequent payment of the tax through offsets of tax \nrefunds destroys the jurisdiction of the Tax Court to \ndecide this dispute. This argument, if accepted by this \nCourt, would require taxpayers to begin litigating the \ndisputed issue anew, in a completely different forum, \nwhere the cost of litigation is typically far greater \nthan the cost of litigation in the Tax Court. \nIn other words, the IRS\u2019s position in this case \nincentivizes taxpayers who prefer litigating in the \nTax Court instead of litigating in a refund forum \n(which is most taxpayers) to refrain from paying a \ndisputed tax liability while they are challenging \u201cthe \nexistence or amount\u201d of a disputed, previously unpaid, \ntax liability in Tax Court in a Collection Due Process \ncase. It is strange indeed that the IRS would advocate \nfor a result that discourages most taxpayers from \npaying a previously unpaid liability while they are \nlitigating the merits of a disputed tax liability in Tax \nCourt in a Collection Due Process case.   \nThe IRS also claims the dispute here is \u201cmoot\u201d \ndespite the fact that the IRS and the taxpayer \ncontinue to disagree sharply as to whether the \ntaxpayer is entitled to a withholding credit against \nthe tax liability in question. It is not possible for a case \nto be \u201cmoot\u201d where a taxpayer and the IRS remain in \ndisagreement regarding the resolution of one of the \n\n5 \n \n \n \nissues that caused the taxpayer to initiate the \nlitigation. \nAmicus supports Ms. Zuch in her efforts to \nprevent the IRS (and some lower courts) from taking \naway an important right granted to taxpayers by \nCongress merely because the taxpayer (involuntarily) \npays a disputed tax liability while a Collection Due \nProcess case is pending in Tax Court. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe IRS\u2019s argument that the Tax Court lost \njurisdiction to resolve the dispute between Ms. Zuch \nand the IRS regarding the disputed estimated tax \npayments after that Court previously obtained \njurisdiction over Ms. Zuch\u2019s case makes no sense. \nThere is nothing in the statutory language that \nindicates that the Tax Court should lose the \njurisdiction it obtained over the case earlier just \nbecause the IRS\u2019s refund offsets fully paid the \ndisputed liability. \nThe  IRS agrees that the Declaratory Judgment \nAct did not bar the Tax Court from granting relief to \nthe taxpayer prior to full payment of the disputed \nliability. The Act likewise does not bar the Tax Court \nfrom granting relief after full payment of the disputed \nliability, as the effect of granting relief in either \nsituation is the same, i.e., to give the taxpayer the \neconomic benefit of the disputed estimated tax credit.. \n\n6 \n \n \n \nA partial payment of the disputed liability \nthrough a refund offset while the case is pending in \nTax Court does not causes the Tax Court to lose \njurisdiction over the dispute, per the IRS. But such a \npartial payment does raise the question of whether \nthe Tax Court can order a refund if the Tax Court \nlater rules that the disputed tax liability against \nwhich the tax refund was offset is not owed. This issue \narises whether the later refund offset pays the \ndisputed liability in part or in full. Thus, the \npurported inability of the Tax Court to order a refund \nin this situation is irrelevant to the resolution of the \nquestion of whether a later refund offset that fully \npays the disputed liability deprives the Tax Court of \njurisdiction to resolve the disputed tax liability.  \nThe Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction in Collection Due \nProcess cases is not as narrow as the IRS contends. \nThe Tax Court has previously ordered the IRS to \nrefund money to a taxpayer in a Collection Due \nProcess case. The Ninth Circuit has held that the Tax \nCourt has the authority to apply the full range of \nequitable principles generally granted to courts that \npossess judicial powers in Collection Due Process \ncases. In any event, the Tax Court in Collection Due \nProcess cases can issue orders to the IRS that require \nthe IRS to take steps that will generate refunds for \ntaxpayers. \nIf the Tax Court does lack jurisdiction to order \nrefunds to taxpayers in Collection Due Process cases, \n\n7 \n \n \n \ntaxpayers can take certain steps to protect their \ninterests. But the potential absence of authority of the \nTax Court to issue refunds in Collection Due Process \ncases has no relevance to the resolution of the present \ndispute. \n \nThe IRS\u2019s argument that the case is moot is \nmeritless. A case cannot be moot when the parties still \ndisagree about the resolution of an issue that has \nbeen raised in the litigation. \n \nSection 6330 is a remedial statute and thus \nshould be construed with its remedial purpose in \nmind. The position advocated by the IRS, if adopted \nby this Court, would create additional burdens on and \ncosts to taxpayers who find themselves in the \nsituation in which Ms. Zuch finds herself. Taxpayers \ncould be required to \u201cstart over\u201d in a new court after \nmany years of litigating in Tax Court and in \nsubsequent appeals. Taxpayers who owe taxes for \nmultiple years could find themselves having to \nlitigate in two different courts simultaneously \nbecause a refund offset fully pays only one of multiple \ntax liabilities. \n \nThe mere act of forcing taxpayers to litigate tax \ndisputes in District Courts will impose significant \nburdens on taxpayers. District Courts, unlike the Tax \nCourt (where most litigants are unrepresented), are \nnot \u201ctaxpayer friendly.\u201d Unrepresented taxpayers \nunfamiliar with District Court procedures may \n\n8 \n \n \n \nsimply give up, particularly if they cannot afford \nrepresentation in District Court.  The cost of \nrepresentation in District Court tax litigation is \nnormally much higher than the cost of such \nrepresentation in the Tax Court, making representing \ninfeasible for taxpayers of modest means. \n \nStatistics show that taxpayers overwhelming \nprefer to litigate tax disputes in the Tax Court. \n \nThe IRS fails to acknowledge that Congress \nchanged the \u201cpay first \u2013 litigate later\u201d rule governing \nthe litigation of the merits of tax liabilities for \ntaxpayers who pursue Collection Due Process \nappeals. The IRS\u2019s assertion that a ruling for Ms. \nZuch will improperly open the floodgates to disputes \nregarding the merits of the underlying liability in \nCollection Due Process cases is completely without \nmerit. The IRS\u2019s use of incomplete statistics does not \nsupport their argument.  \n \nMore importantly, because Congress has \nchanged the \u201cold rules\u201d to allow taxpayers to \nchallenge the merits of an unpaid tax liability in \nCollection Due Process cases, all taxpayers, including \nMs. Zuch, who meet the requirements for challenging \nunpaid liabilities in Collection Due Process appeals \nshould be allowed to bring such a challenge. \n \n\n9 \n \n \n \nARGUMENT \nA. The IRS\u2019s Argument That the Tax Court \nLost Jurisdiction That the IRS Agrees the \nTax Court Had at the Start of the Tax \nCourt Case Makes No Sense \n \nThe Tax Court undisputedly had jurisdiction to \nresolve all of the issues raised by Ms. Zuch in her \nadministrative Collection Due Process Appeal, \nincluding the disputed estimated tax payment, at the \ntime Ms. Zuch filed her Tax Court petition. Even the \nIRS agrees with this point.  \nMs. Zuch filed a timely request for an \nadministrative Collection Due Process hearing with \nthe IRS\u2019s Office of Appeals in response to a Notice of \nIntent to Levy issued pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a76330(b). \nThat request triggered  the duty of the Office of \nAppeals to perform an independent verification \nprocess pursuant to \u00a76330(b)(1) and to consider all \nissues raised by the taxpayer in their administrative \nappeal. 26 U.S.C. \u00a76330(c)(2)(B). \nMs. Zuch raised the issue of whether she was \nentitled to the disputed withholding credit in her \nadministrative Collection Due Process Appeal. Thus, \nthe Office of Appeals was required to consider this \nargument in making its formal Determination. Id. \nHad the Office of Appeals failed to consider this issue \nin its determination, it would have constituted legal \n\n10 \n \n \n \nerror. See, e.g., Loveland v. Commissioner, 151 T.C. 78 \n(2018). \nMs. Zuch then filed a timely petition with the \nTax \nCourt, \nseeking \nreview \nof \nthe \nformal \nDetermination \nby \nthe \nOffice \nof \nAppeals, \na \nDetermination which denied her request that the IRS \ncredit her tax liability with the disputed withholding \ncredit. \u00a76330(d)(1) explicitly states that the Tax Court \nreviews the formal Determination by the Office of \nAppeals and has jurisdiction to do so. Because Ms. \nZuch raised the issue of the disputed withholding \ncredit in her administrative Collection Due Process \nAppeal, and because the Office of Appeals fulfilled its \nstatutory duty to consider that issue in its formal \nDetermination, the Tax Court acquired jurisdiction to \nreview the issue of the disputed withholding credit \nonce a timely Tax Court petition was filed. \nThat should be the beginning and the end the \nstory. There is nothing in the text of the statute \ngranting jurisdiction to the Tax Court the divests that \nCourt of jurisdiction to decide whether Ms. Zuch is \nentitled to the disputed withholding credit merely \nbecause the \u201cunderlying liability\u201d is paid in full \nthrough offsets of refunds owed to Ms. Zuch after the \nTax Court acquired jurisdiction to decide this \nquestion. \nThe various arguments offered by the IRS in an \neffort to avoid the result mandated by the \n\n11 \n \n \n \nstraightforward language of the statute make no \nsense.  For example, the IRS argues that it would be \na violation of the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a72201, for the Tax Court to rule on the issue of \ndisputed withholding credit after the refund offsets \nhave reduced the balance owed to the IRS to zero. \nThis cannot be the case, though. A ruling by the \nTax Court on the issue of the disputed withholding \ncredit prior to any refund offsets is legally no different \nthan such a ruling by the Tax Court after the refund \noffsets. It is the same issue, and will have the same \nlegal effect, both before and after any refund offsets \nare made. In both situations, a ruling for the IRS will \nprevent Ms. Zuch from getting the economic benefit of \nthe disputed withholding credits.  And in both \nsituations a ruling for Ms. Zuch will allow her to get \nthe economic benefit of the disputed withholding \ncredit.  If a ruling by the Tax Court on this issue prior \nto the full payment of the disputed liability through \nrefund offsets would not have been in violation of the \nDeclaratory Judgment Act, a point the IRS appears to \nconcede, there is no logical reason why a ruling by the \nTax Court on this issue after the refund offsets \noccurred would violate the Declaratory Judgment Act. \nThe IRS\u2019s concession that a ruling by the Tax \nCourt on the issue of the disputed withholding credit \nprior to any refund offsets does not violate the \nDeclaratory Judgment Act is well-founded. It would \nmake no sense to interpret \u00a76330(d) in a manner that \n\n12 \n \n \n \nprevents the Tax Court from exercising plenary \nreview of all issues addressed in the Determination of \nthe Office of Appeals, given that the language of \n\u00a76330(d)(1) does not place any limitations upon the \nTax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to review the Determination.    \nIt makes no sense to interpret the language of \n\u00a76330(d)(1) any differently merely because the IRS \nlater grabbed multiple tax refunds of Ms. Zuch to pay \nthe unpaid portion of the tax debt that the IRS \nclaimed that she owed at the outset of the Tax Court \nlitigation. In either scenario, the Tax Court has \njurisdiction to decide the issue of the disputed \nwithholding credit. \nCuriously, it appears that the IRS does not \ncontend that a mere reduction of the unpaid portion \nof the tax debt that existed at the outset of the Tax \nCourt case through later refund offsets causes the \njurisdiction of the Tax Court to disappear.  Per the \nIRS, if there was a refund offset that left $1.00 (one \ndollar) of the \u201cunderlying liability\u201d unpaid, the Tax \nCourt would still have jurisdiction to decide the issue \nof the disputed withholding credit.   \nThis point illustrates the folly of the IRS\u2019s \nargument that this Court should rule against Ms. \nZuch because the Tax Court allegedly lacks the \nauthority to direct the IRS to issue refunds in \nCollection Due Process cases. If the purported \ninability of the Tax Court to order the IRS to issue a \n\n13 \n \n \n \nrefund in a Collection Due Process case where a \nrefund offset reduces the \u201cunderlying liability\u201d to a \nvery small amount during the pendency of the Tax \nCourt case is not a basis for causing the Tax Court\u2019s \njurisdiction to magically disappear, this purported \ninability to order a refund should not be a basis for \ncausing the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to disappear \nmerely because the refund offsets fully pay the \nliability. \nWhile the complete scope of the Tax Court\u2019s \nauthority in Collection Due Process cases is not at \nissue in this case, the IRS\u2019s cramped view of the scope \nof the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction in Collection Due \nProcess cases lacks merit. The Tax Court has \npreviously directed the IRS to refund money to a \ntaxpayer in a Collection Due Process case where the \nIRS took the taxpayer\u2019s money via levy without first \nsending the taxpayer the statutorily required Notice \nof Intent to Levy under  \u00a76330(d)(1). See Chocallo v. \nCommissioner, T.C. Memo 2004-152 (2004).  \nThe Tax Court has also ordered the IRS to \ncredit a taxpayer\u2019s liability for the amount of the \ndecrease in value of stock seized by the IRS in a \nCollection Due Process case where the taxpayer \nrequested the IRS to promptly sell the seized stock, \ndue to a concern that the stock might become \nvalueless, and the IRS failed  to sell the stock as \nrequested.  See Zapara v. Commissioner, 652 F.3d \n1042 (9th Cir, 2011), affirming 124 T.C. 223 (2005), as \n\n14 \n \n \n \nsupplemented, 126 T.C. 215 (2006).  The Ninth Circuit \nstated that, in that Collection Due Process case, the \n\u201cTax Courts have \u2018the authority to apply the full range \nof equitable principles generally granted to courts \nthat possess judicial powers\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted). 652 \nF.3d at1045-46. \nEven assuming, arguendo, that the Tax Court \ncannot issue an order directing the IRS to issue a \nrefund pursuant to a final order in a Collection Due \nProcess case, which is seemingly a dubious \nproposition, the Tax Court can clearly issue an order \nthe IRS to take steps to implement the Court\u2019s \nholding on an issue properly before the Court that \nresult in the IRS issuing a refund. For example, the \nTax Court could issue an order directing the IRS to \ncredit Ms. Zuch\u2019s account for the tax year at issue for \nthe amount of the disputed withholding credit, if she \nprevails at trial in the Tax Court.  Such an order, once \nit becomes final, would create a duty on behalf of the \nIRS to credit her account.  That would generate a \nrefund. \nIf the Tax Court\u2019s power to order the IRS to \nissue a refund in a Collection Due Process case is \nlimited, taxpayers, once they learn of refund offsets \nmade while they are challenging the \u201cexistence or \namount\u201d of a previously unpaid liability in Tax Court \nin a Collection Due Process case, can protect their \ninterests by filing formal  refund claims pending a \nresolution of the Collection Due Process case. If they \n\n15 \n \n \n \nfail to file a formal refund claim, they may be able to \nlater argue that they previously submitted an \ninformal refund claim.  See United States v. Kales, 314 \nU.S. 186 (1941), United States v. Commer. Nat\u2019l Bank, \n874 F.2d 1165 (7th Cir. 1989)(Informal letter to IRS \nAppeals Officer sent during protracted dispute with \nthe IRS constituted a valid informal refund claim).  \nPresumably the IRS would honor a final Tax \nCourt order favoring the taxpayer. If not, in certain \ncircumstances, the taxpayer might avail themselves \nof a suit under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71361.  See Vishnevsky v. \nUnited States, 581 F.2d 1249 (7th Cir. 1978).   \nNone of this, however, provides any support for \nholding that the Tax Court loses jurisdiction to \nresolve a disputed tax liability in Collection Due \nProcess case merely because the IRS collects the full \namount of the previously unpaid liability through \nrefund offsets while the Collection Due Process case \nis pending in the Tax Court. \nThe IRS\u2019s argument that Ms. Zuch\u2019s entire case \nbecame \u201cmoot\u201d due to the offset of her tax refunds is \nself-evidently wrong. Ms. Zuch and the IRS still do not \nagree whether she is entitled to the disputed \nwithholding credit. The fact that the \u201clevy\u201d issue was \nmooted by all of the refund offsets does not render the \nentire case moot and, as explained above, does not \ndeprive the Tax Court of jurisdiction over the dispute \nunder the relevant statutory scheme. \n\n16 \n \n \n \nB.  Section 6330 is a Remedial Statute and \nShould be Interpreted With Its Remedial \nPurpose in Mind \nSection 6330, and its companion statute, 26 \nU.S.C. \u00a76320, were enacted to provide additional \nremedies to taxpayers, due to perceived abusive \nconduct by the IRS.  The Brief for Respondent, at pp.  \n9-10, 36-37, does an excellent job of laying this out. \nGiven that the purpose of the enactment of the \nCollection Due Process provisions is to benefit \ntaxpayers, these provisions should be interpreted in a \nmanner consistent with that purpose. \nThe IRS espouses a position that, if adopted by \nthis Court, would create additional difficulties, costs \nand burdens for taxpayers who were not able to pay \ntheir taxes in the first place and, who, during the \ncourse of litigating the existence or amount of a \npreviously unpaid liability in a Collection Due Process \ncase in Tax Court, find themselves in the unusual \nposition of paying in full the previously unpaid taxes \nthrough refund offsets. \nFor example, suppose that a taxpayer prevails \non a challenge to the existence or amount of a \npreviously unpaid liability in Tax Court in a \nCollection Due Process case after a two year battle, \nand the IRS then appeals the Tax Court\u2019s holding. For \ntaxpayers residing the in Ninth Circuit, this type of \nappeal will typically take 18 to 24 months from entry \n\n17 \n \n \n \nof judgment in the Tax Court. Immediately after oral \nargument in the Court of Appeals, which could be 3 or \n4 years after the start of the Tax Court case, the \npreviously un\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Lavar Taylor is a tax controversy \npractitioner with over 43 years of experience in \nhandling \njudicial \nand \nadministrative \ntax \ncontroversies. His experience includes working for the \nDepartment of Justice as an Assistant United States \nAttorney in the Tax Division of the United States \nAttorney\u2019s Office for the Central District of California, \nas a Senior Attorney for the Internal Revenue Service \n(\u201cIRS\u201d) Office of Chief Counsel, and for taxpayers as \nan attorney in private practice. Mr. Taylor is an \nAdjunct Professor at the Chapman Fowler School of \nLaw where he teaches Federal Tax Procedure, and \nhas served as an Adjunct Professor of Law at the \nUniversity of California, Irvine, School of Law. Mr. \nTaylor and his firm have represented taxpayers in \nmany hundreds of Collection Due Process appeals at \nthe administrative level and in many Collection Due \nProcess cases at the judicial level. Mr. Taylor has been \npersonally involved as a private practitioner in over \n300 cases brought in the U.S. Tax Court (\u201cTax \nCourt\u201d), and has personally been involved in \nnumerous additional tax-related cases in the U.S. \n \n1 No person other than the named Amicus or their counsel \nauthored this Brief or provided financial support for this Brief. \n\n2 \n \n \n \nDistrict Courts (\u201cDistrict Courts\u201d), U.S. Courts of \nAppeal, and this Court as a private practitioner. \nAmicus is filing this brief in support of \nRespondent  Jennifer Zuch.2 The question presented \nin this case is important from the standpoint of tax \nadministration, although the specific outcome of this \nappeal will affect only a narrow subset of taxpayers.  \nIn 1998, Congress explicitly granted taxpayers \nthe right  to challenge the \u201cexistence or amount\u201d of tax \nliabilities in administrative and judicial Collection \nDue Process proceedings brought pursuant to 26 \nU.S.C. \u00a76330 if the taxpayer \u201cdid not receive any \nstatutory notice of deficiency for such tax liability or \ndid not otherwise have an opportunity to dispute such \ntax liability.\u201d See, e.g., Montgomery v. Commissioner, \n122 T.C. 1 (2004) (taxpayer allowed to challenge the \namount of an unpaid liability shown on a \u201cbalance \ndue\u201d personal income tax return).  \nThis was a dramatic change from existing law. \nPrior to the enactment of \u00a76330,  taxpayers against \nwhom the IRS assessed unpaid liabilities without \nfirst issuing a notice of deficiency could generally \ninitiate a judicial challenge to  a disputed liability \n \n2 Amicus regularly represents clients of the type whose interests \ncould be affected by the outcome of this case, but Amicus has not \nbeen retained by any client (or by any third party) for the \npurpose of filing this Brief as Amicus Curiae. \n\n3 \n \n \n \nonly by paying the disputed liability in full, filing a \nclaim for refund, and then filing suit for refund in \nFederal District Court or the Court of Federal Claims. \nSee generally Flora v. United States, 362 U.S. 145 \n(1960). Under prior law, taxpayers such as the \ntaxpayer in Montgomery would have had to pay the \ntax in full, file a claim for refund, and then file suit to \nrecover the refund in District Court or the Court of \nFederal Claims to challenge the \u201cexistence or amount\u201d \nof the unpaid tax debt. Id. That is no longer the case. \nThis significant new opportunity for taxpayers \nto judicially challenge the merits of a disputed \nliability was prompted by a Congressional perception \nthat the IRS was treating taxpayers unfairly, forcing \ntaxpayers to endure hardships in order to pay \ndisputed liabilities that ultimately were not owed. See \nBrief for Respondent at pp. 9-10, 36-37. To remedy the \nperceived unfair treatment of taxpayers, Congress \nchanged the law by giving taxpayers the right to \njudicially challenge the existence or amount of a tax \nliability in what are now called Collection Due \nProcess appeals if the taxpayers did not receive a \nnotice of deficiency or did not otherwise have an \nopportunity to challenge a disputed tax liability. \nThe IRS here improperly asks this Court to \nimpose limitations on an important right granted to \ntaxpayers by Congress.  The limitations requested by \nIRS have no statutory basis and make no practical \nsense.  Furthermore, the IRS agrees that the Tax \n\n4 \n \n \n \nCourt had jurisdiction to decide the dispute regarding \nthe tax liability at issue at the time the Tax Court \npetition was filed and yet argues that the taxpayer\u2019s \nsubsequent payment of the tax through offsets of tax \nrefunds destroys the jurisdiction of the Tax Court to \ndecide this dispute. This argument, if accepted by this \nCourt, would require taxpayers to begin litigating the \ndisputed issue anew, in a completely different forum, \nwhere the cost of litigation is typically far greater \nthan the cost of litigation in the Tax Court. \nIn other words, the IRS\u2019s position in this case \nincentivizes taxpayers who prefer litigating in the \nTax Court instead of litigating in a refund forum \n(which is most taxpayers) to refrain from paying a \ndisputed tax liability while they are challenging \u201cthe \nexistence or amount\u201d of a disputed, previously unpaid, \ntax liability in Tax Court in a Collection Due Process \ncase. It is strange indeed that the IRS would advocate \nfor a result that discourages most taxpayers from \npaying a previously unpaid liability while they are \nlitigating the merits of a disputed tax liability in Tax \nCourt in a Collection Due Process case.   \nThe IRS also claims the dispute here is \u201cmoot\u201d \ndespite the fact that the IRS and the taxpayer \ncontinue to disagree sharply as to whether the \ntaxpayer is entitled to a withholding credit against \nthe tax liability in question. It is not possible for a case \nto be \u201cmoot\u201d where a taxpayer and the IRS remain in \ndisagreement regarding the resolution of one of the \n\n5 \n \n \n \nissues that caused the taxpayer to initiate the \nlitigation. \nAmicus supports Ms. Zuch in her efforts to \nprevent the IRS (and some lower courts) from taking \naway an important right granted to taxpayers by \nCongress merely because the taxpayer (involuntarily) \npays a disputed tax liability while a Collection Due \nProcess case is pending in Tax Court. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe IRS\u2019s argument that the Tax Court lost \njurisdiction to resolve the dispute between Ms. Zuch \nand the IRS regarding the disputed estimated tax \npayments after that Court previously obtained \njurisdiction over Ms. Zuch\u2019s case makes no sense. \nThere is nothing in the statutory language that \nindicates that the Tax Court should lose the \njurisdiction it obtained over the case earlier just \nbecause the IRS\u2019s refund offsets fully paid the \ndisputed liability. \nThe  IRS agrees that the Declaratory Judgment \nAct did not bar the Tax Court from granting relief to \nthe taxpayer prior to full payment of the disputed \nliability. The Act likewise does not bar the Tax Court \nfrom granting relief after full payment of the disputed \nliability, as the effect of granting relief in either \nsituation is the same, i.e., to give the taxpayer the \neconomic benefit of the disputed estimated tax credit.. \n\n6 \n \n \n \nA partial payment of the disputed liability \nthrough a refund offset while the case is pending in \nTax Court does not causes the Tax Court to lose \njurisdiction over the dispute, per the IRS. But such a \npartial payment does raise the question of whether \nthe Tax Court can order a refund if the Tax Court \nlater rules that the disputed tax liability against \nwhich the tax refund was offset is not owed. This issue \narises whether the later refund offset pays the \ndisputed liability in part or in full. Thus, the \npurported inability of the Tax Court to order a refund \nin this situation is irrelevant to the resolution of the \nquestion of whether a later refund offset that fully \npays the disputed liability deprives the Tax Court of \njurisdiction to resolve the disputed tax liability.  \nThe Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction in Collection Due \nProcess cases is not as narrow as the IRS contends. \nThe Tax Court has previously ordered the IRS to \nrefund money to a taxpayer in a Collection Due \nProcess case. The Ninth Circuit has held that the Tax \nCourt has the authority to apply the full range of \nequitable principles generally granted to courts that \npossess judicial powers in Collection Due Process \ncases. In any event, the Tax Court in Collection Due \nProcess cases can issue orders to the IRS that require \nthe IRS to take steps that will generate refunds for \ntaxpayers. \nIf the Tax Court does lack jurisdiction to order \nrefunds to taxpayers in Collection Due Process cases, \n\n7 \n \n \n \ntaxpayers can take certain steps to protect their \ninterests. But the potential absence of authority of the \nTax Court to issue refunds in Collection Due Process \ncases has no relevance to the resolution of the present \ndispute. \n \nThe IRS\u2019s argument that the case is moot is \nmeritless. A case cannot be moot when the parties still \ndisagree about the resolution of an issue that has \nbeen raised in the litigation. \n \nSection 6330 is a remedial statute and thus \nshould be construed with its remedial purpose in \nmind. The position advocated by the IRS, if adopted \nby this Court, would create additional burdens on and \ncosts to taxpayers who find themselves in the \nsituation in which Ms. Zuch finds herself. Taxpayers \ncould be required to \u201cstart over\u201d in a new court after \nmany years of litigating in Tax Court and in \nsubsequent appeals. Taxpayers who owe taxes for \nmultiple years could find themselves having to \nlitigate in two different courts simultaneously \nbecause a refund offset fully pays only one of multiple \ntax liabilities. \n \nThe mere act of forcing taxpayers to litigate tax \ndisputes in District Courts will impose significant \nburdens on taxpayers. District Courts, unlike the Tax \nCourt (where most litigants are unrepresented), are \nnot \u201ctaxpayer friendly.\u201d Unrepresented taxpayers \nunfamiliar with District Court procedures may \n\n8 \n \n \n \nsimply give up, particularly if they cannot afford \nrepresentation in District Court.  The cost of \nrepresentation in District Court tax litigation is \nnormally much higher than the cost of such \nrepresentation in the Tax Court, making representing \ninfeasible for taxpayers of modest means. \n \nStatistics show that taxpayers overwhelming \nprefer to litigate tax disputes in the Tax Court. \n \nThe IRS fails to acknowledge that Congress \nchanged the \u201cpay first \u2013 litigate later\u201d rule governing \nthe litigation of the merits of tax liabilities for \ntaxpayers who pursue Collection Due Process \nappeals. The IRS\u2019s assertion that a ruling for Ms. \nZuch will improperly open the floodgates to disputes \nregarding the merits of the underlying liability in \nCollection Due Process cases is completely without \nmerit. The IRS\u2019s use of incomplete statistics does not \nsupport their argument.  \n \nMore importantly, because Congress has \nchanged the \u201cold rules\u201d to allow taxpayers to \nchallenge the merits of an unpaid tax liability in \nCollection Due Process cases, all taxpayers, including \nMs. Zuch, who meet the requirements for challenging \nunpaid liabilities in Collection Due Process appeals \nshould be allowed to bring such a challenge. \n \n\n9 \n \n \n \nARGUMENT \nA. The IRS\u2019s Argument That the Tax Court \nLost Jurisdiction That the IRS Agrees the \nTax Court Had at the Start of the Tax \nCourt Case Makes No Sense \n \nThe Tax Court undisputedly had jurisdiction to \nresolve all of the issues raised by Ms. Zuch in her \nadministrative Collection Due Process Appeal, \nincluding the disputed estimated tax payment, at the \ntime Ms. Zuch filed her Tax Court petition. Even the \nIRS agrees with this point.  \nMs. Zuch filed a timely request for an \nadministrative Collection Due Process hearing with \nthe IRS\u2019s Office of Appeals in response to a Notice of \nIntent to Levy issued pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a76330(b). \nThat request triggered  the duty of the Office of \nAppeals to perform an independent verification \nprocess pursuant to \u00a76330(b)(1) and to consider all \nissues raised by the taxpayer in their administrative \nappeal. 26 U.S.C. \u00a76330(c)(2)(B). \nMs. Zuch raised the issue of whether she was \nentitled to the disputed withholding credit in her \nadministrative Collection Due Process Appeal. Thus, \nthe Office of Appeals was required to consider this \nargument in making its formal Determination. Id. \nHad the Office of Appeals failed to consider this issue \nin its determination, it would have constituted legal \n\n10 \n \n \n \nerror. See, e.g., Loveland v. Commissioner, 151 T.C. 78 \n(2018). \nMs. Zuch then filed a timely petition with the \nTax \nCourt, \nseeking \nreview \nof \nthe \nformal \nDetermination \nby \nthe \nOffice \nof \nAppeals, \na \nDetermination which denied her request that the IRS \ncredit her tax liability with the disputed withholding \ncredit. \u00a76330(d)(1) explicitly states that the Tax Court \nreviews the formal Determination by the Office of \nAppeals and has jurisdiction to do so. Because Ms. \nZuch raised the issue of the disputed withholding \ncredit in her administrative Collection Due Process \nAppeal, and because the Office of Appeals fulfilled its \nstatutory duty to consider that issue in its formal \nDetermination, the Tax Court acquired jurisdiction to \nreview the issue of the disputed withholding credit \nonce a timely Tax Court petition was filed. \nThat should be the beginning and the end the \nstory. There is nothing in the text of the statute \ngranting jurisdiction to the Tax Court the divests that \nCourt of jurisdiction to decide whether Ms. Zuch is \nentitled to the disputed withholding credit merely \nbecause the \u201cunderlying liability\u201d is paid in full \nthrough offsets of refunds owed to Ms. Zuch after the \nTax Court acquired jurisdiction to decide this \nquestion. \nThe various arguments offered by the IRS in an \neffort to avoid the result mandated by the \n\n11 \n \n \n \nstraightforward language of the statute make no \nsense.  For example, the IRS argues that it would be \na violation of the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a72201, for the Tax Court to rule on the issue of \ndisputed withholding credit after the refund offsets \nhave reduced the balance owed to the IRS to zero. \nThis cannot be the case, though. A ruling by the \nTax Court on the issue of the disputed withholding \ncredit prior to any refund offsets is legally no different \nthan such a ruling by the Tax Court after the refund \noffsets. It is the same issue, and will have the same \nlegal effect, both before and after any refund offsets \nare made. In both situations, a ruling for the IRS will \nprevent Ms. Zuch from getting the economic benefit of \nthe disputed withholding credits.  And in both \nsituations a ruling for Ms. Zuch will allow her to get \nthe economic benefit of the disputed withholding \ncredit.  If a ruling by the Tax Court on this issue prior \nto the full payment of the disputed liability through \nrefund offsets would not have been in violation of the \nDeclaratory Judgment Act, a point the IRS appears to \nconcede, there is no logical reason why a ruling by the \nTax Court on this issue after the refund offsets \noccurred would violate the Declaratory Judgment Act. \nThe IRS\u2019s concession that a ruling by the Tax \nCourt on the issue of the disputed withholding credit \nprior to any refund offsets does not violate the \nDeclaratory Judgment Act is well-founded. It would \nmake no sense to interpret \u00a76330(d) in a manner that \n\n12 \n \n \n \nprevents the Tax Court from exercising plenary \nreview of all issues addressed in the Determination of \nthe Office of Appeals, given that the language of \n\u00a76330(d)(1) does not place any limitations upon the \nTax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to review the Determination.    \nIt makes no sense to interpret the language of \n\u00a76330(d)(1) any differently merely because the IRS \nlater grabbed multiple tax refunds of Ms. Zuch to pay \nthe unpaid portion of the tax debt that the IRS \nclaimed that she owed at the outset of the Tax Court \nlitigation. In either scenario, the Tax Court has \njurisdiction to decide the issue of the disputed \nwithholding credit. \nCuriously, it appears that the IRS does not \ncontend that a mere reduction of the unpaid portion \nof the tax debt that existed at the outset of the Tax \nCourt case through later refund offsets causes the \njurisdiction of the Tax Court to disappear.  Per the \nIRS, if there was a refund offset that left $1.00 (one \ndollar) of the \u201cunderlying liability\u201d unpaid, the Tax \nCourt would still have jurisdiction to decide the issue \nof the disputed withholding credit.   \nThis point illustrates the folly of the IRS\u2019s \nargument that this Court should rule against Ms. \nZuch because the Tax Court allegedly lacks the \nauthority to direct the IRS to issue refunds in \nCollection Due Process cases. If the purported \ninability of the Tax Court to order the IRS to issue a \n\n13 \n \n \n \nrefund in a Collection Due Process case where a \nrefund offset reduces the \u201cunderlying liability\u201d to a \nvery small amount during the pendency of the Tax \nCourt case is not a basis for causing the Tax Court\u2019s \njurisdiction to magically disappear, this purported \ninability to order a refund should not be a basis for \ncausing the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to disappear \nmerely because the refund offsets fully pay the \nliability. \nWhile the complete scope of the Tax Court\u2019s \nauthority in Collection Due Process cases is not at \nissue in this case, the IRS\u2019s cramped view of the scope \nof the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction in Collection Due \nProcess cases lacks merit. The Tax Court has \npreviously directed the IRS to refund money to a \ntaxpayer in a Collection Due Process case where the \nIRS took the taxpayer\u2019s money via levy without first \nsending the taxpayer the statutorily required Notice \nof Intent to Levy under  \u00a76330(d)(1). See Chocallo v. \nCommissioner, T.C. Memo 2004-152 (2004).  \nThe Tax Court has also ordered the IRS to \ncredit a taxpayer\u2019s liability for the amount of the \ndecrease in value of stock seized by the IRS in a \nCollection Due Process case where the taxpayer \nrequested the IRS to promptly sell the seized stock, \ndue to a concern that the stock might become \nvalueless, and the IRS failed  to sell the stock as \nrequested.  See Zapara v. Commissioner, 652 F.3d \n1042 (9th Cir, 2011), affirming 124 T.C. 223 (2005), as \n\n14 \n \n \n \nsupplemented, 126 T.C. 215 (2006).  The Ninth Circuit \nstated that, in that Collection Due Process case, the \n\u201cTax Courts have \u2018the authority to apply the full range \nof equitable principles generally granted to courts \nthat possess judicial powers\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted). 652 \nF.3d at1045-46. \nEven assuming, arguendo, that the Tax Court \ncannot issue an order directing the IRS to issue a \nrefund pursuant to a final order in a Collection Due \nProcess case, which is seemingly a dubious \nproposition, the Tax Court can clearly issue an order \nthe IRS to take steps to implement the Court\u2019s \nholding on an issue properly before the Court that \nresult in the IRS issuing a refund. For example, the \nTax Court could issue an order directing the IRS to \ncredit Ms. Zuch\u2019s account for the tax year at issue for \nthe amount of the disputed withholding credit, if she \nprevails at trial in the Tax Court.  Such an order, once \nit becomes final, would create a duty on behalf of the \nIRS to credit her account.  That would generate a \nrefund. \nIf the Tax Court\u2019s power to order the IRS to \nissue a refund in a Collection Due Process case is \nlimited, taxpayers, once they learn of refund offsets \nmade while they are challenging the \u201cexistence or \namount\u201d of a previously unpaid liability in Tax Court \nin a Collection Due Process case, can protect their \ninterests by filing formal  refund claims pending a \nresolution of the Collection Due Process case. If they \n\n15 \n \n \n \nfail to file a formal refund claim, they may be able to \nlater argue that they previously submitted an \ninformal refund claim.  See United States v. Kales, 314 \nU.S. 186 (1941), United States v. Commer. Nat\u2019l Bank, \n874 F.2d 1165 (7th Cir. 1989)(Informal letter to IRS \nAppeals Officer sent during protracted dispute with \nthe IRS constituted a valid informal refund claim).  \nPresumably the IRS would honor a final Tax \nCourt order favoring the taxpayer. If not, in certain \ncircumstances, the taxpayer might avail themselves \nof a suit under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71361.  See Vishnevsky v. \nUnited States, 581 F.2d 1249 (7th Cir. 1978).   \nNone of this, however, provides any support for \nholding that the Tax Court loses jurisdiction to \nresolve a disputed tax liability in Collection Due \nProcess case merely because the IRS collects the full \namount of the previously unpaid liability through \nrefund offsets while the Collection Due Process case \nis pending in the Tax Court. \nThe IRS\u2019s argument that Ms. Zuch\u2019s entire case \nbecame \u201cmoot\u201d due to the offset of her tax refunds is \nself-evidently wrong. Ms. Zuch and the IRS still do not \nagree whether she is entitled to the disputed \nwithholding credit. The fact that the \u201clevy\u201d issue was \nmooted by all of the refund offsets does not render the \nentire case moot and, as explained above, does not \ndeprive the Tax Court of jurisdiction over the dispute \nunder the relevant statutory scheme. \n\n16 \n \n \n \nB.  Section 6330 is a Remedial Statute and \nShould be Interpreted With Its Remedial \nPurpose in Mind \nSection 6330, and its companion statute, 26 \nU.S.C. \u00a76320, were enacted to provide additional \nremedies to taxpayers, due to perceived abusive \nconduct by the IRS.  The Brief for Respondent, at pp.  \n9-10, 36-37, does an excellent job of laying this out. \nGiven that the purpose of the enactment of the \nCollection Due Process provisions is to benefit \ntaxpayers, these provisions should be interpreted in a \nmanner consistent with that purpose. \nThe IRS espouses a position that, if adopted by \nthis Court, would create additional difficulties, costs \nand burdens for taxpayers who were not able to pay \ntheir taxes in the first place and, who, during the \ncourse of litigating the existence or amount of a \npreviously unpaid liability in a Collection Due Process \ncase in Tax Court, find themselves in the unusual \nposition of paying in full the previously unpaid taxes \nthrough refund offsets. \nFor example, suppose that a taxpayer prevails \non a challenge to the existence or amount of a \npreviously unpaid liability in Tax Court in a \nCollection Due Process case after a two year battle, \nand the IRS then appeals the Tax Court\u2019s holding. For \ntaxpayers residing the in Ninth Circuit, this type of \nappeal will typically take 18 to 24 months from entry \n\n17 \n \n \n \nof judgment in the Tax Court. Immediately after oral \nargument in the Court of Appeals, which could be 3 or \n4 years after the start of the Tax Court case, the \npreviously unpaid tax liability is paid in full through \na refund offset. \nAccording to the IRS, the pending appeal from \nthe Tax Court must be dismissed for lack of \njurisdiction, and the taxpayer must start all over \nagain by pursuing a suit for refund, years after the \nstart of the Tax Court case.  This result is completely \nat odds with the purpose for which \u00a76330 was enacted. \nThis result also makes no sense from a practical \nstandpoint.  \nFurthermore, consider a scenario where a \ntaxpayer has unpaid tax liabilities for multiple years \nand is challenging the existence or amounts of those \nmultiple liabilities in a single Collection Due Process \ncase pending before the Tax Court. Suppose that the \nIRS then offsets a tax refund that pays in full only one \nof the multiple liabilities.  According to the IRS, the \nTax Court must dismiss the year that has been paid \nin full for lack of jurisdiction, while retaining \njurisdiction over the years which have not been paid \nin full.  Such a result has previously occurred. See \nAmanda Iris Gluck Irrevocable Trust v. Comm'r, 154 \nT.C. 259 (2020). \nSuch a result forces a taxpayer to start over for \nthe dismissed tax year and to litigate in two \n\n18 \n \n \n \ncompletely different fora.  This result likewise is at \nodds with the purpose for which \u00a76330 was enacted \nand makes no sense from a practical standpoint.  \nThe additional burdens on, and disadvantages \nto, taxpayers in these scenarios under  the IRS\u2019s \nproffered interpretation of \u00a76330 is not limited to \nhaving to start over in a different court and possibly \nhaving \nto \nlitigate \nin \ntwo \ndifferent \nfora \nsimultaneously. Requiring a taxpayer to litigate in \nDistrict Court instead of Tax Court typically imposes \nsignificant practical and financial burdens on \ntaxpayers, to the point where taxpayers may choose \nnot pursue litigation against the IRS if they are not \nallowed to pursue litigation in Tax Court.  \nThe Tax Court, unlike the District Courts, is a \n\u201ctaxpayer friendly\u201d court. Roughly 75% of all \ntaxpayers who litigate before the Tax Court are \nunrepresented.  Discovery rules in Tax Court are very \nrelaxed; formal discovery is prohibited unless the \nparties first engage in informal discovery.  See, \nBranerton Corp. v. Commissioner, 61 T.C. 691 (1974).  \nDistrict Courts, by contrast, are not at all  \n\u201ctaxpayer friendly.\u201d Formal discovery is the norm, \nand an unrepresented taxpayer who is unfamiliar \nwith the formal discovery rules and the motions \npractice associated with District Court litigation will \noften decide to forgo suing the IRS in District Court if \nthey cannot afford representation.  \n\n19 \n \n \n \nThen there is the massive increase in the cost \nof representation in litigation when a taxpayer is \nrequired to litigate in District Court instead of Tax \nCourt. In the experience of amicus, the cost to \nrepresented taxpayers of litigating in District Court \nis often three to four times the cost to represented \ntaxpayers of litigating in Tax Court. The degree of \nthis disparity in the cost of representation in \nlitigation between the two different fora will vary \ndepending on the issues being litigated, but the cost \nof litigating cases in District Court often makes it \nimpractical for taxpayers to pay for representation in \ntax cases in District Court  unless the amount at issue \nis hundreds of thousand dollars or more. For certain \ntypes of tax cases, it may not make economic sense for \ntaxpayers to pay for representation in District Court \nunless the amount at issue is $500,000 or more.  \nThe IRS National Taxpayer Advocate has \nacknowledged that, for most taxpayers, the Tax Court \nis a far better litigation forum than the District \nCourts and, for that reason, has proposed that \nCongress expand the jurisdiction of the Tax Court to \ninclude refund jurisdiction traditionally exercised by \nthe District Courts.  See National Taxpayer Advocate, \n2023 Purple Book, Legislative Recommendation No. \n43, \n95-96 \n(Dec. \n31, \n2022) \n \nlocated \nat \nhttps://www.taxpayeradvocate.irs.gov/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2023/01/ARC22_PurpleBook_07_Str\nengthTPR.pdf (last visited March 22, 2025). \n\n20 \n \n \n \nStatistics regarding the number of pending \ncourt cases involving federal taxes confirm that \ntaxpayers strongly prefer to litigate in Tax Court as \nopposed to litigating in District Court.  As of \nSeptember 30, 2023, IRS Chief Counsel statistics \nreflected that there were 25,653 cases pending in the \nTax Court. (This number includes Tax Court cases of \nall kinds; Collection Due Process cases make up a \nsmall fraction of this total.)  See SOI Tax Stats - Chief \nCounsel Workload: Tax Litigation Cases, by Type of \nCase \n- \nIRS \nData \nBook \nTable \n31, \nhttps://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-chief-\ncounsel-workload-tax-litigation-cases-by-type-of- \ncase-irs-data-book-table-29 (last visited March 22, \n2025). \nBy way of contrast, only 714 refund cases were \npending nationwide as of June 30, 2023. Id.  Simply \nput, taxpayers generally prefer to litigate in the Tax \nCourt, due to the significant cost and inconvenience \nassociated with litigating tax cases in District Court. \nPer the records available at the above irs.gov website, \na similar disparity between the number of pending \nTax Court cases and the number of pending District \nCourt cases has existed for every year going back to \n1997, the year before Congress enacted the Collection \nDue Process provisions.  Id.  \nGiven this background, it makes no sense to \nconstrue \u00a76330 in a manner that creates more \ndifficulties for, and financial burdens on, taxpayers \n\n21 \n \n \n \nsuch as Ms. Zuch by forcing them to litigate in District \nCourt. \nC.  The IRS May Not Ignore the Fact That \nCongress \nHas \nChanged \nThe \nRules \nRegarding Litigation of the Merits of Tax \nLiabilities for Taxpayers in Collection \nDue Process Appeals; In Any Event, the \nIRS\u2019s Assertion That a Ruling For Ms. \nZuch Will Generate a Flood of New \nLitigation is Meritless \nThe IRS fails to properly acknowledge that \nCongress significantly changed the rules regarding \nthe litigation of the merits of tax liabilities when \nCongress enacted \u00a76330. The IRS states at page 2 of \nits Brief for Petitioner that \u201c[t]he federal tax system \noperates on a simple default premise: pay now, \ndispute later.\u201d But Congress modified those rules for \ntaxpayers in Collection Due Process Appeals. This \ncase is not about the rules as they existed prior to the \nenactment of the Collection Due Process Appeals \nprovisions.  This case is about the changes to the law \nenacted by Congress in 1998. \nThe significant changes to the law made by \nCongress in 1998 in enacting  \u00a7\u00a76320 and 6330, and \nthe reasons why those changes call for this Court to \ninterpret \u00a76330 in the manner urged by Ms. Zuch, are \neloquently articulated in the Brief for Respondent. \n\n22 \n \n \n \nThe IRS offers no cogent reasons why this Court \nshould not affirm the judgment of the Third Circuit. \nThe IRS\u2019s feeble  \u201cscary statistics\u201d argument \nshould be rejected out of hand. The IRS claims that a \nruling in favor of Ms. Zuch could lead to a flood of new \nlitigation. Brief for Petitioner at p. 24. But the IRS \nfails to explain how a holding that permits the \ncontinuation of a case over which the Tax Court \nalready has jurisdiction after a previously unpaid \nliability is paid through tax refund offsets is going to \nlead to increased litigation by a large number of \nadditional taxpayers.    \nThis case is about whether existing cases in \nwhich taxpayers have the right to challenge the \nexistence or amount of an unpaid liability, and over \nwhich the Tax Court has jurisdiction, will be thrown \nout of court. This case is not about whether taxpayers \nwho previously were not able to pursue a challenge to \nthe existence or amount of an unpaid liability will be \nallowed to do so. \nMore broadly, the notion that a ruling for Ms. \nZuch might cause taxpayers to flock en masse to use \nthe Collection Due Process procedures to challenge \nunpaid liabilities is illogical. Taxpayers cannot \nchallenge the merits of the underlying liability in a \nCollection Due Process appeal under \u00a76320 until the \nIRS has filed a Notice of Federal Tax Lien (\u201cNFTL\u201d) \nagainst the taxpayer. The filing of a NFTL provides \n\n23 \n \n \n \nnotice to the public at large that the IRS believes that \nthe taxpayer owes taxes to the IRS in the amount set \nforth in the NFTL and that the IRS is pursuing \ncollection of those taxes against the party whose \nname(s) are listed as taxpayers in the NFTL.   \nThe filing of the NFTL typically has additional \nadverse consequences for all taxpayers, beyond \nletting the world know that the IRS is pursuing \ncollection of the unpaid tax liability shown on the \nNFTL. The filing of a NFTL can trigger defaults \nunder \nloan \nagreements \nand \nunder \npersonal \nguarantees of loans. It can also significantly curtail \nthe taxpayer\u2019s ability to do business or to keep their \njob. The taxpayer\u2019s ability to borrow funds becomes \nsignificantly limited. Taxpayers cannot encumber or \nsell their real property or most other assets to third \nparties without involving the IRS.  Additional adverse \nconsequences are possible, if not likely.  \nCollection Due Process appeals brought under \n\u00a76330 following the issuance of a Notice of Intent to \nLevy likewise expose taxpayers to situations that are \npotentially harmful. IRS revenue officers are directed \nby the Internal Revenue Manual to decide whether to \nfile a NFTL promptly after beginning work on a case. \nSee IRM 5.12.2.3.2 (10-14-2013). Thus, in most cases, \na levy Collection Due Process proceeding is unlikely \nto take place unless the IRS has already filed a NFTL \nagainst the taxpayer. Furthermore, it is not a \npleasant experience to receive a notice stating that \n\n24 \n \n \n \nthe IRS intends to levy on all of your assets and be \nforced to pursue a levy Collection Due Process appeal \nin order to both protect your assets from levy action \nand challenge the merits of the underlying liability.  \nThe vast majority of Collection Due Process \nAppeals handled by amicus involve simultaneous \nappeals pursued under both \u00a7\u00a76320 and 6330. In that \nregard, the present case is atypical.  \nThe IRS states, at Brief for Petitioner at p.24, \nthat there were 28,349 \u00a76330 Collection Due Process \nappeals closed in 2023. The IRS then suggests that, if \nthe Court rules in favor Ms. Zuch, it will open the \nfloodgates to  challenges to the merits of unpaid \nliabilities \nunder \nthe \nCollection \nDue \nProcess \nprocedures.  \nThe IRS, however, fails to advise the Court \nwhat percentage of those taxpayers disputed their tax \nliabilities in their Collection Due Process Appeals. It \nis probable that only a fraction of those taxpayers \ndisputed the \u201cunderlying liability\u201d in the Collection \nDue Process appeals.   \nThe IRS also fails to inform the Court that \nCollection Due Process appeal cases constitute only a \nsmall fraction  of the Tax Court\u2019s existing caseload \nand that only an unidentified portion of that small \nfraction of the Tax Court\u2019s existing case involves \nchallenges to the existence or amount of the \n\n25 \n \n \n \npreviously unpaid tax liability. Thus, as the Brief for \nRespondent explains, it is unlikely that a ruling in \nfavor of Ms. Zuch will generate a flood of new \nchallenges to the existence or amount of the liability \nin Collection Due Process appeals. \nBut the proper response to the IRS\u2019s argument \non this point is as follows. To the extent any of the \n28,349 taxpayers identified in the relevant Report \nhad a bona fide challenge to the existence or amount \nof the underlying liability, and if they did not receive \na notice of deficiency or did not otherwise have an \nopportunity to dispute the existence or amount of the \nunderlying liability, Congress has made it clear that \nthey were entitled to challenge the existence or \namount of the underlying liability in their Collection \nDue Process appeals. That is true whether the \nnumber of taxpayers choosing to exercise their \nstatutory rights to challenge the existence or amount \nof the underlying liability was a \u201cflood\u201d or a \u201ctrickle.\u201d \nThe IRS\u2019s statement at page 24 of the Brief for \nPetitioner, that \u201c[n]othing in the text or history of \n\u00a76330 supports that end-run around the calibrated \nstatutory framework that generally provides for post-\npayment adjudication of disputes over tax liability,\u201d is \ncategorically untrue. \u00a76330(d) explicitly provides for a \ndeparture from the \u201cold rules.\u201d  \nThe IRS has already conceded that the Tax \nCourt had jurisdiction to determine the amount of Ms. \n\n26 \n \n \n \nZuch\u2019s disputed tax liability in a situation in which \nthe \u201cold rules\u201d would have prohibited the Tax Court \nfrom resolving that dispute. It is disingenuous for the \nIRS to have made the above quoted statement. \nThe IRS, having conceded that the Tax Court \nhad jurisdiction to resolve the disputed regarding the \ndisputed estimated tax credit at the time Ms. Zuch \nfiled her Tax Court petition, now argues for a result \nthat, if adopted by this Court, would actually \ndiscourage taxpayers from paying their disputed tax \nliability while litigating the merits of a disputed \nliability in a Collection Due Process Tax Court case. \nAmicus does not believe that Congress intended such \na result. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n27 \n \n \n \nCONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth above, Amicus urges  \nthis Court to affirm the holding of the Seventh Circuit \nand to remand the case to the Tax Court to determine \nwhether Ms. Zuch is entitled to the disputed \nwithholding credit. \n \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \nA.

This information is absolutely essential for predicting how the Justices will analyze the government's position and, ultimately, how they will vote. It moves beyond the summary in the petition for certiorari to the full, detailed reasoning the Court will be asked to adopt.\n\nDesign EIG is moderate (0.5) because successfully using this action confirms a core, fundamental strategy in legal prediction: always analyze the primary briefs from the parties. While not a novel or complex strategy, verifying the high value of this basic step is crucial for building a robust and reliable prediction methodology. It reinforces the importance of starting with the primary source arguments before moving to amicus briefs or other secondary materials.\n\nThe joint EIG is high because this action provides a massive amount of task-specific information while also validating a cornerstone of the overall prediction process.",

App. 44a-49a, 50a-\n60a) are unreported. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nMarch 22, 2024.  A petition for rehearing was denied on \nJune 26, 2024 (Pet. App. 68a-69a).  On September 12, \n2024, Justice Alito extended the time within which to \nfile a petition for a writ of certiorari to and including \nOctober 11, 2024, and the petition was filed on that date.  \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari was granted on Jan-\nuary 10, 2025.  The jurisdiction of this Court rests on 28 \nU.S.C. 1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent statutory provisions are reprinted in an \nappendix to this brief.  App., infra, 1a-9a.  \nINTRODUCTION \nThe federal tax system operates on a simple default \npremise: pay now, dispute later.  In 1998, Congress en-\nacted a narrow exception to that rule.  If the Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS) seeks to levy on\u2014that is, affirm-\natively seize and sell\u2014a taxpayer\u2019s property, the IRS \ngenerally must provide the taxpayer with pre-levy notice \nand an opportunity for a hearing before the IRS Indepen-\ndent Office of Appeals (Appeals Office).  26 U.S.C. 6330.  \nThe Appeals Office makes a \u201cdetermination\u201d whether the \nIRS may proceed with \u201cthe levy action[] which [is] the \nsubject of the requested hearing.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3) \nand (e)(1).  A taxpayer disappointed with the outcome \nof the pre-levy hearing may \u201cpetition the Tax Court for \nreview of such determination.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1).   \nThis case presents the question whether a Section \n6330 proceeding in the Tax Court becomes moot when \nthere is no longer a live controversy over the levy.  Here, \nthe IRS initially proposed a levy on respondent\u2019s prop-\nerty, and she initiated a Section 6330 proceeding for \npre-deprivation review.  But before the Tax Court\u2019s re-\nview concluded, the IRS determined that respondent\u2019s \nintervening, additional payments meant that she no long-\ner owed any additional tax, so the IRS no longer sought \nto collect by levying on her property.   \nThat development mooted the proceeding for pre-\nlevy review.  When the IRS has decided not to pursue its \nproposed levy, the taxpayer has already received \u201cthe \nvery relief [she] ostensibly sought\u201d by requesting a pre-\ndeprivation hearing.  Willson v. Commissioner, 805 \nF.3d 316, 321 (D.C. Cir. 2015).  The Tax Court can pro-\n\n3 \n \nvide no further relief, and the Section 6330 proceeding \nmust end.  \nThe text of Section 6330 makes clear that it provides \na narrow path for review of a proposed levy\u2014not a \nmeans to circumvent the usual methods of disputing a \ntaxpayer\u2019s liability.  The decision below thus erred in \nconcluding that the Tax Court could still address wheth-\ner respondent has any \u201cunderlying tax liability\u201d\u2014an is-\nsue that may be considered under 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B) \nwhen evaluating whether a proposed levy may proceed.  \nWhen there is no proposed levy to adjudicate, the ques-\ntion of tax liability ceases to be an \u201cunderlying\u201d one.  \nNor does the Tax Court have jurisdiction to issue de-\nclaratory relief separate from its ability to enjoin the \nproposed levy that is \u201cthe subject of the requested hear-\ning.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(1). \nThat there is no longer review under Section 6330 \ndoes not foreclose judicial review of the IRS\u2019s handling \nof respondent\u2019s taxes.  Rather, as respondent has al-\nready acknowledged (Br. in Opp. 2, 4, 13, 16, 25), she \ncan proceed under the general rule and dispute the as-\nsessment and collection of her taxes in a refund suit.  \nBecause the court of appeals\u2019 contrary decision thwarts \nCongress\u2019s distinction between that general rule and \nthe narrow exception for pre-levy review, this Court \nshould reverse. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal Background \n1. The traditional mechanism for a taxpayer to dis-\npute the assessment or collection of a federal tax is a \npost-payment suit for a refund.  See CIC Servs., LLC v. \nIRS, 593 U.S. 209, 212 (2021) (\u201c[A] person can typically \nchallenge a federal tax only after he pays it, by suing for \na refund.\u201d).  To bring a refund suit, a taxpayer must first \n\n4 \n \npay the tax and then request a refund from the IRS.   \n26 U.S.C. 6402(a), 6511; 26 C.F.R. 301.6402\u20132; Flora v. \nUnited States, 357 U.S. 63, 64-75 (1958), aff\u200a\u2019d on reh\u2019g, \n362 U.S. 145 (1960).  If the refund is denied, the tax-\npayer may sue to recover the disputed amount.  28 \nU.S.C. 1346(a)(1); see 26 U.S.C. 6532, 7422(a); 28 U.S.C. \n1491(a)(1); United States v. Clintwood Elkhorn Mining \nCo., 553 U.S. 1, 4 (2008); see also, e.g., G.M. Leasing \nCorp. v. United States, 429 U.S. 338, 352 n.18 (1977) \n(collecting cases for the proposition that post-payment \nreview of a tax liability comports with due process).  \nFor certain taxes, however, Congress has also pro-\nvided a pre-assessment avenue for judicial review.  Spe-\ncifically, for income, estate, gift, and various other \ntaxes, Congress has directed the IRS to issue a \u201cnotice \nof  * * *  deficiency\u201d to a taxpayer who has failed to re-\nport a tax properly.  26 U.S.C. 6212(a).  The taxpayer \nmay then file a petition for redetermination in the Tax \nCourt.  26 U.S.C. 6213.  With certain exceptions, the \nIRS may not attempt to collect the tax at issue before \nthe time for seeking judicial review has expired or while \nsuch review is pending.  26 U.S.C. 6213(a).  \nThe Internal Revenue Code and other statutes chan-\nnel judicial review of challenges to tax assessment and \ncollection to those prescribed mechanisms.  The Tax \nAnti-Injunction Act, 26 U.S.C. 7421(a), and the tax ex-\nception to the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. \n2201(a), generally preclude suits for injunctive and de-\nclaratory relief regarding the assessment or collection \nof taxes.  And 26 U.S.C. 7422(a) precludes suits to re-\ncover taxes alleged to have been assessed or collected \nunlawfully before a taxpayer has properly sought a re-\nfund from the IRS. \n\n5 \n \n2. Following assessment, if a taxpayer who is \u201cliable \nto pay any tax neglects or refuses to pay,\u201d the IRS may \ngenerally \u201ccollect such tax\u201d by \u201clevy[ing] upon\u201d the tax-\npayer\u2019s property, i.e., seizing and selling it.  26 U.S.C. \n6331(a); see 26 U.S.C. 6331(b) (defining \u201clevy\u201d to \u201cin-\nclude[] the power of distraint and seizure by any means,\u201d \nand permitting the sale of \u201csuch property or rights to \nproperty\u201d); see also 26 U.S.C. 6321 (providing for tax \nliens).  Certain types of property\u2014including, with some \nexceptions, residences, welfare and unemployment ben-\nefits, and particular pensions\u2014are exempt from levies.  \nSee 26 U.S.C. 6334. \nBefore 1998, the Internal Revenue Code authorized \nthe IRS to levy upon taxpayer property without any \nprior opportunity for a hearing or other pre-collection \nprocess, so long as adequate post-deprivation proce-\ndures were available.  See Phillips v. Commissioner, \n283 U.S. 589, 595 (1931); 26 U.S.C. 6331(d) (1994).  In \n1998, however, Congress established procedures that \nthe IRS generally must follow before levying.  See Tax-\npayer Bill of Rights 3 (Taxpayer Bill of Rights), Pub. L. \nNo. 105-206, Tit. III, \u00a7 3401(b), 112 Stat. 747-749 (26 \nU.S.C. 6330); see also id. \u00a7 3401(a), 112 Stat. 746-747 (26 \nU.S.C. 6320) (substantially similar framework for IRS \nfiling of a notice of federal tax lien).  \nThose procedures are codified in Section 6330 of the \nCode, which is entitled \u201c[n]otice and opportunity for \nhearing before levy.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330.  Under those pro-\ncedures, \u201c[n]o levy may be made\u201d unless the IRS pro-\nvides the taxpayer with 30 days\u2019 notice and the oppor-\ntunity to request a hearing.  26 U.S.C. 6330(a)(1); see 26 \nU.S.C. 6330(a)(2) and (3).   \nIf the taxpayer makes such a request, an administra-\ntive hearing to review the proposed levy\u2014sometimes \n\n6 \n \ncalled a \u201ccollection due process hearing,\u201d Boechler, P.C. \nv. Commissioner, 596 U.S. 199, 202 (2022)\u2014is con-\nducted by an impartial officer in the Appeals Office.  26 \nU.S.C. 6330(b).  The taxpayer\u2019s request for a hearing \nsuspends \u201cthe levy actions which are the subject of the \nrequested hearing\u201d as well as the running of specified \nlimitations periods.  26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(1).   \nAt the hearing, the taxpayer may raise \u201cany relevant \nissue relating to the unpaid tax or the proposed levy,\u201d \nincluding \u201cchallenges to the appropriateness of collec-\ntion actions\u201d and \u201coffers of collection alternatives.\u201d  26 \nU.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(A)(ii) and (iii); see 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(4) \n(excluding certain issues that were previously litigated \nor qualify as frivolous).  If the taxpayer \u201cdid not receive \nany statutory notice of deficiency for [the relevant] tax \nliability or did not otherwise have an opportunity to dis-\npute such tax liability,\u201d she also may raise \u201cchallenges \nto the existence or amount of the underlying tax liabil-\nity.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B). \nAt the conclusion of a Section 6330 hearing, the  \nAppeals Office issues its \u201cdetermination,\u201d 26 U.S.C. \n6330(c)(3), which is \u201ca written notice\u201d reflecting wheth-\ner \u201ccollection by way of levy may proceed.\u201d  Lunsford v. \nCommissioner, 117 T.C. 159, 164-165 (2001).  The Ap-\npeals Office reaches its determination after considering \nstatutorily delineated factors, including whether the re-\nquirements of applicable law or administrative proce-\ndure have been met, 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(1) and (3)(A); the \nissues raised by the taxpayer, 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2) and \n(3); and \u201cwhether any proposed collection action bal-\nances the need for the efficient collection of taxes with \nthe legitimate concern of the [taxpayer] that any collec-\ntion action be no more intrusive than necessary,\u201d 26 \nU.S.C. 6330(c)(3)(C).   \n\n7 \n \nA taxpayer who is dissatisfied with a determination \nsustaining a levy may petition the United States Tax \nCourt \u201cfor review of such determination (and the Tax \nCourt shall have jurisdiction with respect to such mat-\nter).\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1).  The Tax Court\u2019s decision, \nin turn, is subject to review by a federal court of ap-\npeals.  26 U.S.C. 7482(a)(1). \n3. Although a taxpayer\u2019s request for a Section 6330 \nhearing suspends \u201cthe levy actions which are the sub-\nject of the requested hearing\u201d and certain limitations \nperiods, 26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(1), other mechanisms for tax \ncollection may proceed.  Most relevant here, when a tax-\npayer overpays the tax owed for a particular year, the \nIRS \u201cmay credit the amount of such overpayment\u201d \nagainst \u201cany liability in respect of an internal revenue \ntax on the part of the person who made the overpay-\nment\u201d instead of refunding that amount to the taxpayer.  \n26 U.S.C. 6402(a).   \nThat application of overpayment credits\u2014sometimes \nreferred to as an \u201coffset\u201d\u2014is an administrative action \ndistinct from the collection of a tax by a levy or lien on \nthe taxpayer\u2019s property.  See Belloff v. Commissioner, \n996 F.2d 607, 616 (2d Cir. 1993); Boyd v. Commissioner, \n124 T.C. 296, 300 (2005); 26 C.F.R. 301.6330\u20131(g)(2),  \nQ & A-G3.  A taxpayer may challenge the application of \ncredits through the traditional mechanism for disputing \nthe collection of a federal tax: filing a refund claim with \nthe IRS and, if necessary, a refund suit.  See 26 U.S.C. \n7422(a) and (d). \nB. The Present Controversy \n1. From 1993 to 2014, respondent was married to \nPatrick Gennardo.  Pet. App. 7a.  This case concerns the \n2010 tax year, for which respondent and Gennardo ulti-\nmately filed separate tax returns.  Ibid.  \n\n8 \n \na. In 2010 and 2011, respondent and Gennardo made \ntwo estimated tax payments, totaling $50,000, to the \nIRS for tax year 2010.  Pet. App. 8a.  First, the couple \nsubmitted an estimated tax payment of $20,000.  Ibid.  \nThe accompanying Form 1040-ES identified both of \ntheir names, but it did not indicate that they would be \nfiling separate returns, and it provided no instructions \non how to allocate the payment between them.  C.A. \nApp. 274, 314.  Second, Gennardo submitted a $30,000 \nbank check, which identified only Gennardo as the re-\nmitter.  Pet. App. 8a; see C.A. App. 274, 315.  The sub-\nject line of the accompanying cover letter identified \nboth respondent and Gennardo, but neither the check \nnor any accompanying documentation instructed the \nIRS to allocate any part of that payment to respondent.  \nC.A. App. 275, 315, 633, 638. \nb. On September 12, 2012, the couple filed separate \n(and untimely) 2010 federal income-tax returns.  Pet. \nApp. 7a; see C.A. App. 316-381.  Respondent did not claim \nany of the $50,000 in estimated tax payments on her re-\nturn, while Gennardo claimed $10,000 in estimated tax \npayments on his return.  C.A. App. 317, 331. Respond-\nent\u2019s and Gennardo\u2019s tax returns were prepared by the \nsame tax preparer.  Id. at 277. \nOn the same day that they submitted their separate \ntax returns, Gennardo made a written compromise offer \nto the IRS about his outstanding federal tax liabilities \nfor tax years 2007 through 2011.  C.A. App. 278, 382.  \nAlthough the offer covered years in which respondent \nand Gennardo had filed joint tax returns, Gennardo\u2019s  \noffer-in-compromise did not include respond\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

App., infra, 1a-9a.  \nINTRODUCTION \nThe federal tax system operates on a simple default \npremise: pay now, dispute later.  In 1998, Congress en-\nacted a narrow exception to that rule.  If the Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS) seeks to levy on\u2014that is, affirm-\natively seize and sell\u2014a taxpayer\u2019s property, the IRS \ngenerally must provide the taxpayer with pre-levy notice \nand an opportunity for a hearing before the IRS Indepen-\ndent Office of Appeals (Appeals Office).  26 U.S.C. 6330.  \nThe Appeals Office makes a \u201cdetermination\u201d whether the \nIRS may proceed with \u201cthe levy action[] which [is] the \nsubject of the requested hearing.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3) \nand (e)(1).  A taxpayer disappointed with the outcome \nof the pre-levy hearing may \u201cpetition the Tax Court for \nreview of such determination.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1).   \nThis case presents the question whether a Section \n6330 proceeding in the Tax Court becomes moot when \nthere is no longer a live controversy over the levy.  Here, \nthe IRS initially proposed a levy on respondent\u2019s prop-\nerty, and she initiated a Section 6330 proceeding for \npre-deprivation review.  But before the Tax Court\u2019s re-\nview concluded, the IRS determined that respondent\u2019s \nintervening, additional payments meant that she no long-\ner owed any additional tax, so the IRS no longer sought \nto collect by levying on her property.   \nThat development mooted the proceeding for pre-\nlevy review.  When the IRS has decided not to pursue its \nproposed levy, the taxpayer has already received \u201cthe \nvery relief [she] ostensibly sought\u201d by requesting a pre-\ndeprivation hearing.  Willson v. Commissioner, 805 \nF.3d 316, 321 (D.C. Cir. 2015).  The Tax Court can pro-\n\n3 \n \nvide no further relief, and the Section 6330 proceeding \nmust end.  \nThe text of Section 6330 makes clear that it provides \na narrow path for review of a proposed levy\u2014not a \nmeans to circumvent the usual methods of disputing a \ntaxpayer\u2019s liability.  The decision below thus erred in \nconcluding that the Tax Court could still address wheth-\ner respondent has any \u201cunderlying tax liability\u201d\u2014an is-\nsue that may be considered under 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B) \nwhen evaluating whether a proposed levy may proceed.  \nWhen there is no proposed levy to adjudicate, the ques-\ntion of tax liability ceases to be an \u201cunderlying\u201d one.  \nNor does the Tax Court have jurisdiction to issue de-\nclaratory relief separate from its ability to enjoin the \nproposed levy that is \u201cthe subject of the requested hear-\ning.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(1). \nThat there is no longer review under Section 6330 \ndoes not foreclose judicial review of the IRS\u2019s handling \nof respondent\u2019s taxes.  Rather, as respondent has al-\nready acknowledged (Br. in Opp. 2, 4, 13, 16, 25), she \ncan proceed under the general rule and dispute the as-\nsessment and collection of her taxes in a refund suit.  \nBecause the court of appeals\u2019 contrary decision thwarts \nCongress\u2019s distinction between that general rule and \nthe narrow exception for pre-levy review, this Court \nshould reverse. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal Background \n1. The traditional mechanism for a taxpayer to dis-\npute the assessment or collection of a federal tax is a \npost-payment suit for a refund.  See CIC Servs., LLC v. \nIRS, 593 U.S. 209, 212 (2021) (\u201c[A] person can typically \nchallenge a federal tax only after he pays it, by suing for \na refund.\u201d).  To bring a refund suit, a taxpayer must first \n\n4 \n \npay the tax and then request a refund from the IRS.   \n26 U.S.C. 6402(a), 6511; 26 C.F.R. 301.6402\u20132; Flora v. \nUnited States, 357 U.S. 63, 64-75 (1958), aff\u200a\u2019d on reh\u2019g, \n362 U.S. 145 (1960).  If the refund is denied, the tax-\npayer may sue to recover the disputed amount.  28 \nU.S.C. 1346(a)(1); see 26 U.S.C. 6532, 7422(a); 28 U.S.C. \n1491(a)(1); United States v. Clintwood Elkhorn Mining \nCo., 553 U.S. 1, 4 (2008); see also, e.g., G.M. Leasing \nCorp. v. United States, 429 U.S. 338, 352 n.18 (1977) \n(collecting cases for the proposition that post-payment \nreview of a tax liability comports with due process).  \nFor certain taxes, however, Congress has also pro-\nvided a pre-assessment avenue for judicial review.  Spe-\ncifically, for income, estate, gift, and various other \ntaxes, Congress has directed the IRS to issue a \u201cnotice \nof  * * *  deficiency\u201d to a taxpayer who has failed to re-\nport a tax properly.  26 U.S.C. 6212(a).  The taxpayer \nmay then file a petition for redetermination in the Tax \nCourt.  26 U.S.C. 6213.  With certain exceptions, the \nIRS may not attempt to collect the tax at issue before \nthe time for seeking judicial review has expired or while \nsuch review is pending.  26 U.S.C. 6213(a).  \nThe Internal Revenue Code and other statutes chan-\nnel judicial review of challenges to tax assessment and \ncollection to those prescribed mechanisms.  The Tax \nAnti-Injunction Act, 26 U.S.C. 7421(a), and the tax ex-\nception to the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. \n2201(a), generally preclude suits for injunctive and de-\nclaratory relief regarding the assessment or collection \nof taxes.  And 26 U.S.C. 7422(a) precludes suits to re-\ncover taxes alleged to have been assessed or collected \nunlawfully before a taxpayer has properly sought a re-\nfund from the IRS. \n\n5 \n \n2. Following assessment, if a taxpayer who is \u201cliable \nto pay any tax neglects or refuses to pay,\u201d the IRS may \ngenerally \u201ccollect such tax\u201d by \u201clevy[ing] upon\u201d the tax-\npayer\u2019s property, i.e., seizing and selling it.  26 U.S.C. \n6331(a); see 26 U.S.C. 6331(b) (defining \u201clevy\u201d to \u201cin-\nclude[] the power of distraint and seizure by any means,\u201d \nand permitting the sale of \u201csuch property or rights to \nproperty\u201d); see also 26 U.S.C. 6321 (providing for tax \nliens).  Certain types of property\u2014including, with some \nexceptions, residences, welfare and unemployment ben-\nefits, and particular pensions\u2014are exempt from levies.  \nSee 26 U.S.C. 6334. \nBefore 1998, the Internal Revenue Code authorized \nthe IRS to levy upon taxpayer property without any \nprior opportunity for a hearing or other pre-collection \nprocess, so long as adequate post-deprivation proce-\ndures were available.  See Phillips v. Commissioner, \n283 U.S. 589, 595 (1931); 26 U.S.C. 6331(d) (1994).  In \n1998, however, Congress established procedures that \nthe IRS generally must follow before levying.  See Tax-\npayer Bill of Rights 3 (Taxpayer Bill of Rights), Pub. L. \nNo. 105-206, Tit. III, \u00a7 3401(b), 112 Stat. 747-749 (26 \nU.S.C. 6330); see also id. \u00a7 3401(a), 112 Stat. 746-747 (26 \nU.S.C. 6320) (substantially similar framework for IRS \nfiling of a notice of federal tax lien).  \nThose procedures are codified in Section 6330 of the \nCode, which is entitled \u201c[n]otice and opportunity for \nhearing before levy.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330.  Under those pro-\ncedures, \u201c[n]o levy may be made\u201d unless the IRS pro-\nvides the taxpayer with 30 days\u2019 notice and the oppor-\ntunity to request a hearing.  26 U.S.C. 6330(a)(1); see 26 \nU.S.C. 6330(a)(2) and (3).   \nIf the taxpayer makes such a request, an administra-\ntive hearing to review the proposed levy\u2014sometimes \n\n6 \n \ncalled a \u201ccollection due process hearing,\u201d Boechler, P.C. \nv. Commissioner, 596 U.S. 199, 202 (2022)\u2014is con-\nducted by an impartial officer in the Appeals Office.  26 \nU.S.C. 6330(b).  The taxpayer\u2019s request for a hearing \nsuspends \u201cthe levy actions which are the subject of the \nrequested hearing\u201d as well as the running of specified \nlimitations periods.  26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(1).   \nAt the hearing, the taxpayer may raise \u201cany relevant \nissue relating to the unpaid tax or the proposed levy,\u201d \nincluding \u201cchallenges to the appropriateness of collec-\ntion actions\u201d and \u201coffers of collection alternatives.\u201d  26 \nU.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(A)(ii) and (iii); see 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(4) \n(excluding certain issues that were previously litigated \nor qualify as frivolous).  If the taxpayer \u201cdid not receive \nany statutory notice of deficiency for [the relevant] tax \nliability or did not otherwise have an opportunity to dis-\npute such tax liability,\u201d she also may raise \u201cchallenges \nto the existence or amount of the underlying tax liabil-\nity.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B). \nAt the conclusion of a Section 6330 hearing, the  \nAppeals Office issues its \u201cdetermination,\u201d 26 U.S.C. \n6330(c)(3), which is \u201ca written notice\u201d reflecting wheth-\ner \u201ccollection by way of levy may proceed.\u201d  Lunsford v. \nCommissioner, 117 T.C. 159, 164-165 (2001).  The Ap-\npeals Office reaches its determination after considering \nstatutorily delineated factors, including whether the re-\nquirements of applicable law or administrative proce-\ndure have been met, 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(1) and (3)(A); the \nissues raised by the taxpayer, 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2) and \n(3); and \u201cwhether any proposed collection action bal-\nances the need for the efficient collection of taxes with \nthe legitimate concern of the [taxpayer] that any collec-\ntion action be no more intrusive than necessary,\u201d 26 \nU.S.C. 6330(c)(3)(C).   \n\n7 \n \nA taxpayer who is dissatisfied with a determination \nsustaining a levy may petition the United States Tax \nCourt \u201cfor review of such determination (and the Tax \nCourt shall have jurisdiction with respect to such mat-\nter).\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1).  The Tax Court\u2019s decision, \nin turn, is subject to review by a federal court of ap-\npeals.  26 U.S.C. 7482(a)(1). \n3. Although a taxpayer\u2019s request for a Section 6330 \nhearing suspends \u201cthe levy actions which are the sub-\nject of the requested hearing\u201d and certain limitations \nperiods, 26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(1), other mechanisms for tax \ncollection may proceed.  Most relevant here, when a tax-\npayer overpays the tax owed for a particular year, the \nIRS \u201cmay credit the amount of such overpayment\u201d \nagainst \u201cany liability in respect of an internal revenue \ntax on the part of the person who made the overpay-\nment\u201d instead of refunding that amount to the taxpayer.  \n26 U.S.C. 6402(a).   \nThat application of overpayment credits\u2014sometimes \nreferred to as an \u201coffset\u201d\u2014is an administrative action \ndistinct from the collection of a tax by a levy or lien on \nthe taxpayer\u2019s property.  See Belloff v. Commissioner, \n996 F.2d 607, 616 (2d Cir. 1993); Boyd v. Commissioner, \n124 T.C. 296, 300 (2005); 26 C.F.R. 301.6330\u20131(g)(2),  \nQ & A-G3.  A taxpayer may challenge the application of \ncredits through the traditional mechanism for disputing \nthe collection of a federal tax: filing a refund claim with \nthe IRS and, if necessary, a refund suit.  See 26 U.S.C. \n7422(a) and (d). \nB. The Present Controversy \n1. From 1993 to 2014, respondent was married to \nPatrick Gennardo.  Pet. App. 7a.  This case concerns the \n2010 tax year, for which respondent and Gennardo ulti-\nmately filed separate tax returns.  Ibid.  \n\n8 \n \na. In 2010 and 2011, respondent and Gennardo made \ntwo estimated tax payments, totaling $50,000, to the \nIRS for tax year 2010.  Pet. App. 8a.  First, the couple \nsubmitted an estimated tax payment of $20,000.  Ibid.  \nThe accompanying Form 1040-ES identified both of \ntheir names, but it did not indicate that they would be \nfiling separate returns, and it provided no instructions \non how to allocate the payment between them.  C.A. \nApp. 274, 314.  Second, Gennardo submitted a $30,000 \nbank check, which identified only Gennardo as the re-\nmitter.  Pet. App. 8a; see C.A. App. 274, 315.  The sub-\nject line of the accompanying cover letter identified \nboth respondent and Gennardo, but neither the check \nnor any accompanying documentation instructed the \nIRS to allocate any part of that payment to respondent.  \nC.A. App. 275, 315, 633, 638. \nb. On September 12, 2012, the couple filed separate \n(and untimely) 2010 federal income-tax returns.  Pet. \nApp. 7a; see C.A. App. 316-381.  Respondent did not claim \nany of the $50,000 in estimated tax payments on her re-\nturn, while Gennardo claimed $10,000 in estimated tax \npayments on his return.  C.A. App. 317, 331. Respond-\nent\u2019s and Gennardo\u2019s tax returns were prepared by the \nsame tax preparer.  Id. at 277. \nOn the same day that they submitted their separate \ntax returns, Gennardo made a written compromise offer \nto the IRS about his outstanding federal tax liabilities \nfor tax years 2007 through 2011.  C.A. App. 278, 382.  \nAlthough the offer covered years in which respondent \nand Gennardo had filed joint tax returns, Gennardo\u2019s  \noffer-in-compromise did not include respondent.  C.A. \nApp. 386.  Consistent with the terms of the offer and \nIRS rules governing payments related to pending of-\nfers, the IRS applied the full $50,000 in estimated tax \n\n9 \n \npayments to Gennardo\u2019s separate account.  Pet. App. \n8a; see C.A. App. 277-279, 310, 384, 466, 468, 473, 662; \nI.R.S. Notice 2006-68, 2006-31 I.R.B. 105.   \nc. In November 2012, respondent filed an amended \nreturn for the 2010 tax year showing that she owed an \nadditional $27,682.  Pet. App. 9a; see C.A. App. 279, 475, \n477.  For the first time, respondent\u2019s amended return \nalso claimed for herself the full $50,000 in estimated tax \npayments, yielding a claimed overpayment of $21,918 \nfor the 2010 tax year.  Pet. App. 9a; see C.A. App. 280, \n475.  Because the IRS had already allocated the $50,000 \nto Gennardo, it declined to apply the estimated pay-\nments to respondent\u2019s account.  C.A. App. 280.  Instead, \nthe IRS assessed the tax that respondent had reported \non her amended return, along with interest and a late-\nfiling penalty of $7020.  Ibid.   \n2. a. In 2013, the IRS sent respondent a notice and \ndemand for payment of her balance due.  C.A. App. 280.  \nRespondent failed to pay, and the IRS sent her a notice \nof its intent to levy on her property to collect the unpaid \ntaxes.  Pet. App. 70a-75a; C.A. App. 571-573.   \nRespondent invoked her right under Section 6330 to \nchallenge the proposed levy in a hearing before the Ap-\npeals Office.  Pet. App. 10a; C.A. App. 567-570.  She con-\ntended that the IRS should have applied the full $50,000 \nin estimated tax payments to her account, which would \nhave satisfied her self-reported underlying tax liability \nand resulted in a refund.  Pet. App. 10a; C.A. App. 567.   \nIn 2014, after a hearing, the Appeals Office issued a \ndetermination sustaining the IRS\u2019s proposed levy, ex-\nplaining that the estimated tax payments could not be \napplied to respondent\u2019s account because they had been \ncredited to Gennardo\u2019s account.  Pet. App. 61a-67a.  Re-\nspondent petitioned the Tax Court for review, and in \n\n10 \n \n2016, the Tax Court remanded to the Appeals Office for \nclarification of several issues.  C.A. App. 16; Pet. App. \n50a-60a.  On remand, the Appeals Office reaffirmed its \nprior determination to sustain the proposed levy, ex-\nplaining in a 2017 supplemental notice of determination \nthat the estimated tax payments had been properly al-\nlocated to Gennardo.  Pet. App. 44a-49a. \nb. While respondent\u2019s pre-levy proceedings were \npending before the Appeals Office and the Tax Court, \nrespondent overpaid her taxes for 2013 and subsequent \ntax years.  Pet. App. 12a-13a.  The IRS exercised its au-\nthority under Section 6402(a) to credit her overpay-\nments in those years against her 2010 tax liability.  Ibid.  \nBy April 15, 2019, the credits transferred from later tax \nyears had reduced the balance due on respondent\u2019s 2010 \nliability to $0.  Id. at 13a. \nIn March 2020, the IRS moved to dismiss as moot the \npre-levy proceeding before the Tax Court, explaining \nthat respondent\u2019s 2010 tax liability had been satisfied \nand the IRS therefore \u201cno longer intend[ed] to pursue \nthe proposed collection action.\u201d  Pet. App. 42a; see C.A. \nDoc. 5-4, at 450 (July 21, 2022) (motion to dismiss).   \nThe Tax Court granted the motion and dismissed the \ncase.  Pet. App. 40a-43a.  The court explained that the \n\u201ccase is moot\u201d \u201c[b]ecause there is no unpaid liability for \nthe determination year upon which a levy could be \nbased, and [the IRS] is no longer pursuing the proposed \ncollection action.\u201d  Id. at 43a (citing McLane v. Commis-\nsioner, 24 F.4th 316 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 143 S. Ct. \n408 (2022); Greene-Thapedi v. Commissioner, 126 T.C. \n1, 7 (2006)).  The court acknowledged that respondent \ncontinued to argue that the IRS should have credited \nthe estimated payments to her, but the court reasoned \nthat because it did not \u201chave jurisdiction to determine \n\n11 \n \nan overpayment or to order a refund or credit of tax \npaid in a section 6330 proceeding, this is not the proper \nforum to determine whether, and the extent to which, if \nany, the underlying liability has been overpaid.\u201d  Ibid.  \nThe court observed that respondent could still \u201cpursue \nany refund to which she might be entitled through tra-\nditional Federal income procedures, including if neces-\nsary, initiating a case in a different Federal court.\u201d  \nIbid. \n3. The court of appeals vacated the Tax Court\u2019s or-\nder of dismissal and remanded for the Tax Court to de-\ntermine whether respondent was entitled to the esti-\nmated tax payments that the IRS had allocated to Gen-\nnardo.  Pet. App. 1a-39a.   \nAlthough the court of appeals acknowledged that \n\u201cthe Tax Court need not hear a moot case,\u201d Pet. App. \n16a, the court of appeals held that the proceedings be-\nfore the Tax Court are \u201cnot moot,\u201d id. at 2a.  In a part \nof the opinion joined by only two members of the panel, \nthe court of appeals concluded that the Tax Court has \njurisdiction in a Section 6330 pre-levy proceeding to re-\nview a taxpayer\u2019s \u201cunderlying tax liability,\u201d id. at 26a \n(quoting 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B)), and that the statute \ndoes not \u201csuggest that a taxpayer\u2019s right to challenge \nthe existence or amount of her underlying tax becomes \nmoot once the levy is no longer being enforced or the \ntax is satisfied,\u201d id. at 26a-27a.  The court of appeals \nreasoned that even though the IRS is no longer seeking \nto take respondent\u2019s property by levy, the Tax Court \nretains jurisdiction to \u201cdeclare that [respondent] had a \nright to the estimated payments.\u201d  Id. at 37a.  The court \nof appeals acknowledged that its holding is contrary to \nthose of the Fourth and D.C. Circuits, which have held \nthat a Section 6330 proceeding in the Tax Court is moot \n\n12 \n \nwhen the IRS no longer seeks to levy on a taxpayer\u2019s \nproperty.  Id. at 27a (citing McLane, 24 F.4th at 319 (4th \nCir.); Willson v. Commissioner, 805 F.3d 316, 321 (D.C. \nCir. 2015)).   \nIn a part of the opinion joined by all three members \nof the panel, the court of appeals alternatively con-\ncluded that the case is not moot on the theory that the \nTax Court has jurisdiction to determine whether the \nIRS validly exercised its authority under Section 6402 \nto use respondent\u2019s later-year overpayments to offset \nher 2010 tax liability.  Pet. App. 19a-25a.  Respondent \nhad made only a passing reference to the validity of the \noffsets in her reply brief, see Resp. C.A. Reply Br. 16-\n17, but after oral argument, the court of appeals ap-\npointed an amicus to address the question (along with \nsix other issues), C.A. Doc. 45 (June 1, 2023).   \nIn holding that the Tax Court may review the appli-\ncation of credits under Section 6402, the court of ap-\npeals relied on \u201can implicit grant\u201d of jurisdiction, ob-\nserving that \u201c[i]t may be that Congress has not explic-\nitly granted the Tax Court such power.\u201d  Pet. App. 20a.  \nSpecifically, the court of appeals reasoned that Section \n6402 \u201ccarries forward the common law of setoffs,\u201d which \nmeans that the Tax Court has implicit jurisdiction to re-\nview the application of credits in a pre-levy proceeding, \neven absent a proposed levy.  Id. at 21a.1   \nThe court of appeals then considered the application \nof Section 6402 credits to respondent\u2019s 2010 tax liability \nin the first instance.  Even though Section 6402 allows \n \n1  Although the court of appeals used the terms \u201coffset\u201d and \u201cset-\noff\u200a\u201d interchangeably, the statute uses \u201coffset\u201d to refer to an over-\npayment credit, see 26 U.S.C. 6402, while \u201csetoff\u200a\u201d is typically used \nto describe the common-law principle, see, e.g., United States v. \nMunsey Trust Co., 332 U.S. 234, 239 (1947). \n\n13 \n \nthe application of credits to \u201cany liability,\u201d 26 U.S.C. \n6402(a), the court determined that the offset was \u201cinva-\nlid and without legal effect\u201d because common-law setoff \nprinciples do not apply to disputed debts, Pet. App. 25a.  \nHaving concluded that respondent\u2019s \u201ctax obligation was \nnot properly set off,\u201d the court determined that her tax \nliability remains, and she may \u201cchallenge the IRS\u2019s ap-\nplication of the estimated payments\u201d in a Section 6330 \nproceeding.  Id. at 19a.   \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nA pre-levy proceeding under 26 U.S.C. 6330 is moot \nwhen there is no longer a live dispute over the proposed \nlevy that gave rise to the proceeding. \nA. The Tax Court is a court of limited jurisdiction, \ncapable of exercising only the jurisdiction expressly \nconferred on it by Congress.  The Tax Court has been \ngranted jurisdiction over a \u201cpetition  * * *  for review\u201d \nof the Appeals Office\u2019s \u201cdetermination\u201d whether a par-\nticular levy may proceed.  26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1).  When \nthe IRS no longer seeks to proceed by levy\u2014such that \nthere is no live dispute over \u201cthe levy action[] which  \n[is] the subject of the requested hearing,\u201d 26 U.S.C. \n6330(e)(1)\u2014the taxpayer\u2019s challenge is moot, and the \nTax Court lacks jurisdiction to resolve it. \nAt every step in the Section 6330 process, the statu-\ntory text squarely focuses on the question whether a \nlevy may go forward.  The statute mandates that the \ntaxpayer receive notice and an opportunity for a hear-\ning \u201cbefore levy\u201d; it requires that certain levy-related \ninformation be conveyed in the notice; and it instructs \nthat the Appeals Office\u2019s \u201cdetermination\u201d must \u201ctake \ninto consideration,\u201d inter alia, \u201cwhether any proposed \ncollection action balances the need for the efficient col-\nlection of taxes with the legitimate concern of the per-\n\n14 \n \nson that any collection action be no more intrusive than \nnecessary.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(a) and (c)(3)(C).  Once the \nAppeals Office determines whether the levy may pro-\nceed, Section 6330 authorizes the Tax Court to review \n\u201csuch determination.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1).  But where \nthere is no longer a live dispute over a levy, there is \nnothing left for the Tax Court to do, and the case is \nmoot. \nB. That understanding is consistent with Section \n6330\u2019s history and its role in the Internal Revenue Code.  \nCongress enacted Section 6330 to ensure that taxpayers \nhave a pre-deprivation opportunity to contest levies.  \nSection 6330 was not designed to, and did not, provide a \nbroader means for taxpayers to dispute their tax liabil-\nity untethered from proposed levies. \nC. The court of appeals\u2019 and respondent\u2019s contrary \narguments lack merit.  Both the court and respondent \nhave suggested that the Tax Court retains jurisdiction \nabsent a live dispute over a levy because, in some cir-\ncumstances, Section 6330(c)(2)(B) permits a taxpayer to \nraise at a pre-levy hearing \u201cchallenges to the existence \nor amount of the underlying tax liability.\u201d  26 U.S.C. \n6330(c)(2)(B); see Pet. App. 19a; Br. in Opp. 14.  But, as \nthat text underscores, a taxpayer\u2019s \u201cunderlying tax lia-\nbility\u201d must underlie the proposed collection action\u2014\nthat is, the levy.  The statute thus does not support treat-\ning a taxpayer\u2019s challenge to her \u201cunderlying tax liabil-\nity\u201d as providing a freestanding basis for Tax Court ju-\nrisdiction.  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B).  Rather, where Sec-\ntion 6330(c)(2)(B) applies, it simply supplies one \u201ccon-\nsideration\u201d that the Appeals Office must \u201ctake into\u201d ac-\ncount when issuing the \u201cdetermination\u201d whether the \nproposed levy may proceed.  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B) and \n(3).  When there is no live dispute over a proposed levy, \n\n15 \n \nthere is no Tax Court jurisdiction to address the \u201cun-\nderlying\u201d question.  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B). \nThe court of appeals alternatively held that the Tax \nCourt has \u201cimplicit\u201d jurisdiction to review the IRS\u2019s al-\nlocation of respondent\u2019s later-year overpayments to off-\nset her tax liability.  Pet. App. 20a.  Respondent has not \ndefended that rationale in this Court, and for good rea-\nson.  Congress must expressly provide for Tax Court \njurisdiction by statute, and no statute grants that court \nauthority to review Section 6402 credits in a Section \n6330 proceeding.  Even if the Tax Court could conduct \nsuch review, it still could not provide meaningful relief. \nD. This case is moot.  When respondent failed to pay \nher self-reported 2010 tax debt, the IRS proposed to \ncollect her liability by administrative levy.  Respondent \nthen invoked her right to a pre-levy proceeding under \nSection 6330.  But while that proceeding was ongoing, \nrespondent overpaid her taxes for subsequent tax \nyears, and the IRS used its authority under Section \n6402 to credit those overpayments against respondent\u2019s \n2010 tax debt.  With no debt remaining, the IRS aban-\ndoned the levy that was \u201cthe subject of the requested \nhearing,\u201d 26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(1).  The Tax Court therefore \nlacked jurisdiction to review the Appeals Office\u2019s \u201cde-\ntermination\u201d that the levy could proceed.  26 U.S.C. \n6330(d)(1).   \nThat does not, however, leave respondent without a \njudicial remedy:  She may dispute the IRS\u2019s allocation \nof the 2010 estimated payments and her subsequent \noverpayments in a refund suit, the traditional mecha-\nnism for such challenges (and the one that she could \nhave used if the IRS had never proposed a levy).  But \nabsent a live dispute over a potential levy, Section 6330 \nhas no role to play. \n\n16 \n \nARGUMENT \nA PRE-LEVY PROCEEDING UNDER 26 U.S.C. 6330 IS MOOT \nWHEN THERE IS NO LONGER A LIVE DISPUTE OVER THE \nPROPOSED LEVY THAT GAVE RISE TO THE PROCEEDING \nThe court of appeals held that a pre-levy proceeding \nunder 26 U.S.C. 6330 may continue even when there is \nno longer a live dispute over the proposed levy that gave \nrise to the proceeding.  Pet. App. 16a-39a.  That holding \nis incorrect.  Section 6330 is narrowly trained on the ap-\npropriateness of a proposed levy.  When the parties no \nlonger dispute the propriety of such a levy, the proceed-\ning becomes moot.  This Court should reverse. \nA. The Text Of Section 6330 Makes Clear That A Pre-Levy \nProceeding Is Moot When The IRS No Longer Seeks To \nLevy On A Taxpayer\u2019s Property \n1. The United States Tax Court is \u201ca court of limited \njurisdiction.\u201d  Commissioner v. McCoy, 484 U.S. 3, 7 (1987) \n(per curiam).  It may exercise \u201conly the power \u2018expressly \nconferred by Congress.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. 14a (quoting Sunoco \nInc. v. Commissioner, 663 F.3d 181, 187 (3d Cir. 2011)); \nsee 26 U.S.C. 7442; see, e.g., Commissioner v. Gooch \nMilling & Elevator Co., 320 U.S. 418, 422 (1943) (dis-\ncussing the Tax Court\u2019s predecessor, the Board of Tax \nAppeals).  \u201cThus, if a case raises a question within the \njurisdictional purview of the tax court, and that ques-\ntion is subsequently resolved, the case is moot\u201d\u2014and \nthe Tax Court lacks jurisdiction\u2014\u201cnotwithstanding the \nexistence of other live controversies between the tax-\npayer and the IRS that do not fall within the tax court\u2019s \njurisdiction.\u201d  Willson v. Commissioner, 805 F.3d 316, \n320 (D.C. Cir. 2015). \nHere, it is undisputed that the relevant jurisdiction-\nconferring provision is 26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1).  See Pet. 8; \nBr. in Opp. 14; see also Pet. App. 14a.  Section 6330 pro-\n\n17 \n \nvides a mechanism for \u201cthe taxpayer [to] challenge [a] \nlevy or offer collection alternatives\u201d before a seizure of \nthe taxpayer\u2019s property occurs.  Boechler, P.C. v. Com-\nmissioner, 596 U.S. 199, 202 (2022).  That procedure\u2014\nalong with the similar one for tax liens, 26 U.S.C. 6320\u2014\nis only necessary when the IRS is attempting to use a \nlien or levy to enforce collection of a tax liability.  If the \nIRS\u2019s Appeals Office issues a \u201cdetermination\u201d that the \nproposed levy may proceed, Section 6330(d)(1) grants \nthe Tax Court \u201cjurisdiction\u201d over the taxpayer\u2019s peti-\ntion for review of \u201csuch determination.\u201d  26 U.S.C. \n6330(d)(1); see 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3).   \nThe entire point of the Section 6330 proceeding is to \ndetermine whether the IRS may go forward with its \nproposed levy.  Thus, at every step, the statutory text is \nnarrowly focused on that question.  Congress supplied \nthe title for the section:  \u201cNotice and opportunity for \nhearing before levy.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330; Taxpayer Bill of \nRights \u00a7 3401(b), 112 Stat. 747.  Section 6330(a)(1) di-\nrectly ties the right to a hearing to the proposed levy, \nproviding that \u201c[n]o levy may be made on any property \nor right to property of any person unless the Secretary \nhas notified such person in writing of their right to a \nhearing under this section before such levy is made.\u201d  26 \nU.S.C. 6330(a)(1); see Greene-Thapedi v. Commissioner, \n126 T.C. 1, 6, 8 (2006).  Notice of the proposed levy must \nbe given \u201cnot less than 30 days before the day of the \nfirst levy,\u201d and it must include a variety of levy-related \ninformation, including \u201cthe proposed action\u201d; \u201cthe pro-\nvisions of [Title 26] relating to levy and sale of prop-\nerty\u201d; \u201cthe procedures applicable to the levy and sale of \nproperty under [Title 26]\u201d; \u201cthe administrative appeals \navailable to the taxpayer with respect to such levy and \nsale\u201d; \u201cthe alternatives available to taxpayers which \n\n18 \n \ncould prevent levy on property\u201d; and \u201cthe provisions of \n[Title 26] and procedures relating to redemption of \nproperty and release of liens on property.\u201d  26 U.S.C. \n6330(a)(2) and (3)(C).  The exceptions to Section 6330 \nalso reflect its focus on levies.  The pre-levy procedure \nis unavailable if the Secretary finds that \u201cthe collection \nof tax is in jeopardy,\u201d or if the case concerns certain lev-\nies imposed on States, \u201cdisqualified employment tax \nlev[ies],\u201d or \u201cFederal contractor lev[ies].\u201d  26 U.S.C. \n6330(f\u200a).  In those instances, \u201cthe taxpayer shall be given \nthe opportunity for the hearing described in [Section \n6330] within a reasonable period of time after the levy.\u201d  \nIbid.   \nIf no exception applies and the taxpayer invokes her \nstatutory right to a pre-levy hearing, \u201cthe levy actions \nwhich are the subject of the requested hearing\u201d and cer-\ntain limitations periods \u201cshall be suspended for the pe-\nriod during which such hearing, and appeals therein, are \npending.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(1); see 26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(2) \n(providing an exception to this rule).  Because the levy \nis the \u201csubject of the requested hearing,\u201d ibid., it would \nmake little sense for the action to continue once the IRS \nno longer seeks to enforce the levy.  \nThe outcome of the \u201cCollection Due Process\u201d or \n\u201cCDP hearing\u201d under Section 6330 is a \u201c\u200a\u2018determination\u2019 \nregarding the legitimacy of the proposed levy.\u201d  Will-\nson, 805 F.3d 318, 320 (quoting 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3)); \nsee McLane v. Commissioner, 24 F.4th 316, 318-319 \n(4th Cir.), cert. denied, 143 S. Ct. 408 (2022) (explaining \nthat \u201cthe Appeals Office determines in the first instance \nwhether the IRS\u2019s collection action may go forward\u201d).  \nAt the hearing, the taxpayer may raise \u201cany relevant \nissue relating to the unpaid tax or the proposed levy,\u201d \nincluding \u201cappropriate spousal defenses,\u201d \u201cchallenges to \n\n19 \n \nthe appropriateness of collection actions,\u201d and \u201coffers of \ncollection alternatives.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(A).  The \nAppeals Office\u2019s \u201c\u200adetermination,\u201d in turn, \u201cshall take \ninto consideration  * * *  whether any proposed collec-\ntion action balances the need for the efficient collection \nof taxes with the legitimate concern of the person that \nany collection action be no more intrusive than neces-\nsary.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3)(C).   \nIn certain cases where the taxpayer has not previ-\nously had the opportunity to dispute her tax liability, \nthe taxpayer may also raise \u201cchallenges to the existence \nor amount of the underlying tax liability.\u201d  26 U.S.C. \n6330(c)(2)(B).  But like the other issues that the tax-\npayer may raise, such challenges to the taxpayer\u2019s un-\nderlying liability are simply \u201cconsideration[s]\u201d that feed \ninto the ultimate \u201cdetermination\u201d whether the levy may \nproceed.  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3)(C).   \nIn this case, for example, the Notice of Determina-\ntion that the Appeals Office sent respondent recounted \nthe Appeals Office\u2019s \u201cdetermination  * * *  that the pro-\nposed levy  * * *  balances the need for efficient collec-\ntion of taxes with [respondent\u2019s] legitimate concern that \nany collection action be no more intrusive than neces-\nsary.\u201d  Pet. App. 63a.  And it stated that \u201cthe Final No-\ntice of [I]ntent to Levy [was therefore] being sus-\ntained.\u201d  Ibid.; see id. at 64a (\u201cAppeals has determined \nto sustain the action (levy).\u201d). \n2. The statutory focus on the appropriateness of a \nproposed levy follows the case to the Tax Court.  Section \n6330(d)(1) provides that \u201cwithin 30 days of a determina-\ntion under this section\u201d\u2014that is, a determination \nwhether the levy may go forward\u2014the taxpayer may \n\u201cpetition the Tax Court for review of such determina-\ntion.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1).  And crucially, the statute \n\n20 \n \nvests the Tax Court with \u201cjurisdiction with respect to \nsuch matter,\u201d ibid.\u2014i.e., the \u201cpetition for review of [the \nAppeals Office\u2019s] determination.\u201d  Boechler, 596 U.S. at \n204; see, e.g., Lunsford v. Commissioner, 117 T.C. 159, \n164 (2001) (explaining that the Tax Court\u2019s \u201cjurisdiction  \n* * *  is established when there is a written notice that \nembodies a determination to proceed with the collection \nof the taxes in issue, and a timely filed petition\u201d there-\nfrom).  Thus, the Tax Court proceedings\u2014like the ear-\nlier Appeals Office proceedings\u2014are squarely focused \non whether the IRS may enforce a proposed levy. \n3. Once the IRS has determined that it is no longer \nseeking to levy on the taxpayer\u2019s property, there is \nnothing left for the Tax Court to do.  Such a decision not \nto pursue a levy is \u201cthe very relief [the taxpayer] osten-\nsibly sought when [she] requested a [Section 6330] \nhearing to challenge the proposed levy in the first \nplace,\u201d and it is \u201call the relief that section 6330 author-\nizes the tax court to grant.\u201d  Willson, 805 F.3d at 321.  \nSection 6330(e)(1) provides that if a taxpayer requests \na hearing, \u201cthe levy actions which are the subject of the \nrequested hearing  * * *  shall be suspended\u201d during the \npendency of the hearing and any appeals.  26 U.S.C. \n6330(e)(1).  The statute further states that \u201c[n]otwith-\nstanding the provisions of section 7421(a)\u201d\u2014the Tax \nAnti-Injunction Act\u2014\u201cthe beginning of a levy or pro-\nceeding during\u201d that period of suspension \u201cmay be en-\njoined by a proceeding in the proper court, including the \nTax Court\u201d if an appeal to the Tax Court is timely filed.  \nIbid.  But the timely appeal triggers Tax Court jurisdic-\ntion to enjoin other actions \u201conly in respect of the un-\npaid tax or proposed levy to which the determination \nbeing appealed relates.\u201d  Ibid.  And that power ceases \nto matter when the IRS has already decided not to pur-\n\n21 \n \nsue the proposed levy because it is satisfied that the tax \nhas been paid. \nThus, when the IRS determines that it no longer \nneeds or intends to take the taxpayer\u2019s property by \nlevy, the pre-levy proceeding becomes moot.  That is \ntrue whether the liability has been \u201cabated,\u201d see Will-\nson, 805 F.3d at 320 (IRS ceased pursuing levy based on \nincorrect assessment); Byers v. Commissioner, 740 \nF.3d 668, 679 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (similar); or has been sat-\nisfied with other taxpayer funds, see McLane, 24 F.4th \nat 319; Greene-Thapedi, 126 T.C. at 7.   \nAnd the proceeding remains moot regardless of \nwhether the taxpayer contends that the IRS has made \nan error or continues to owe her money.  See Willson, \n805 F.3d at 320; McLane, 24 F.4th at 319 n.*; Greene-\nThapedi, 126 T.C. at 7.  The taxpayer may make those \narguments in a post-deprivation suit for a refund\u2014the \ntraditional mechanism for disputing the assessment or \ncollection of a federal tax.  See 26 U.S.C. 7422(a); 28 \nU.S.C. 1346(a)(1), 1491(a)(1).  But the Section 6330 pro-\nceeding is a rare pre-deprivation mechanism for chal-\nlenging a particular method of a collection: a proposed \nlevy.  Once the IRS no longer seeks to deprive the tax-\npayer of any property by levy, the issue that prompted \nthe Section 6330 proceeding is no longer \u201c\u200a\u2018live,\u2019\u200a\u201d and the \nparties have ceased to have any \u201clegally cognizable in-\nterest\u201d in a determination regarding the permissibility \nof the levy.  Chafin v. Chafin, 568 U.S. 165, 172 (2013) \n(citation omitted).2   \n \n2 Although it is not organized under Article III, the Tax Court has \nconcluded that \u201c[t]he case or controversy requirement under Article \nIII \u2018presumptively\u2019 applies in the Tax Court.\u201d  Pet. App. 15a (quot-\ning Battat v. Commissioner, 148 T.C. 32, 46 (2017)).  This Court \nneed not determine whether the Tax Court\u2019s understanding is cor-\n\n22 \n \nB. Section 6330\u2019s History And Function Within The Inter-\nnal Revenue Code Confirm That A Pre-levy Proceeding \nBecomes Moot When There Is No Longer A Live Dispute \nOver A Proposed Levy  \n1. As discussed above, the default means for a tax-\npayer to dispute the assessment or collection of a federal \ntax is a post-payment refund suit.  See pp. 3-4, supra.  Be-\nfore 1998, the Internal Revenue Code authorized the \nIRS to levy upon taxpayer property without any prior \nopportunity for a hearing or other pre-collection pro-\ncess, so long as the taxpayer was given 30 days\u2019 notice.  \nSee 26 U.S.C. 6331(d) (1994); see, e.g., Iames v. Com-\nmissioner, 850 F.3d 160, 165 (4th Cir. 2017) (describing \n\u201cthe Commissioner\u2019s significant and previously unfet-\ntered power to levy\u201d).   \nThat changed in 1998, when Congress enacted \u201ca \nprocedural protection for taxpayers to oppose IRS col-\nlection actions\u201d before they occurred.  Jeffers v. Com-\nmissioner, 992 F.3d 649, 655 (7th Cir. 2021).  In making \nthat change, Congress\u2019s \u201cgeneral focus\u201d was \u201con the \nCommissioner\u2019s collection of a predetermined liability.\u201d  \n \nrect.  Regardless of whether Article III constraints apply, \u201cthe con-\ntroversy must also fall within the [Tax Court\u2019s] statutory grant of \njurisdiction.\u201d  Willson, 805 F.3d at 320.  And once the IRS has de-\ntermined that it will not pursue a levy, the Tax Court lacks statutory \njurisdiction over a Section 6330 proceeding.  This Court may resolve \nthe question presented on that basis.  See Sinochem Int\u2019l Co. v. Ma-\nlaysia Int\u2019l Shipping Corp., 549 U.S. 422, 430-431 (2007).    \n In any event, assuming that Article III principles do apply, the \ncase is moot.  Respondent has no live interest in contesting a with-\ndrawn levy, and the only relief that the Tax Court could provide\u2014a \ndetermination that the levy could not go forward, and an injunction \nagainst it\u2014would not constitute \u201ceffectual relief,\u201d Campbell-Ewald \nCo. v. Gomez, 577 U.S. 153, 161 (2016) (citation omitted), after the \nproposed levy has already been withdrawn.   \n\n23 \n \nIames, 850 F.3d at 165.  That is, Congress designed Sec-\ntion 6330 to review a proposed levy, not to provide a \nmore general opportunity for a taxpayer to challenge an \nassessment of tax. \nThe pre-levy procedures in Section 6330 were under-\nstood as \u201cestablish[ing] formal procedures designed to \ninsure due process where the IRS seeks to collect taxes \nby levy.\u201d  S. Rep. No. 174, 105th Cong., 2d Sess. 67 (1998); \nsee ibid. (\u201c[T]he Committee believes that the IRS \nshould afford taxpayers adequate notice of collection ac-\ntivity and a meaningful hearing before the IRS deprives \nthem of their property.\u201d); see also H.R. Rep. No. 599, \n105th Cong., 2d Sess. 263 (1998) (describing the new \nprovision in similar terms).  \u201c[T]he entire purpose be-\nhind the creation of [Section 6330] was to provide tax-\npayers with greater due process to contest the IRS\u2019s \nlevy and sale of their property.\u201d  Zapara v. Commis-\nsioner, 652 F.3d 1042, 1045 (9th Cir. 2011).  Nothing in \nthe history of the provision suggests that Congress in-\ntended for the pre-levy proceeding to continue where \nthere is no longer a live dispute over a proposed levy. \n2. That understanding of Section 6330 is consistent \nwith its important but limited function within the Inter-\nnal Revenue Code.  Challenges to the assessment of a \ntax are generally the province of post-payment refund \nsuits, and in the case of certain taxes, pre-payment de-\nficiency actions.  See pp. 3-4, supra.  The Internal Rev-\nenue Code and other statutes protect that principle \nthrough provisions like the Tax Anti-Injunction Act, 26 \nU.S.C. 7421(a), and the tax exception to the Declaratory \nJudgment Act, 28 U.S.C. 2201(a), which generally pre-\nclude suits for injunctive and declaratory relief regard-\ning the assessment or collection of taxes.  Understood \nagainst that backdrop, Section 6330 is a limited mecha-\n\n24 \n \nnism to ensure that a taxpayer may \u201cchallenge a levy \nbefore seizure and sale,\u201d Pet. App. 4a\u2014not an addi-\ntional avenue to seek relief in the absence of a live dis-\npute over a levy.   \nThere are tens of thousands of Section 6330 proceed-\nings each year.  See Treasury Inspector Gen. for Tax \nAdmin., U.S. Dep\u2019t of the Treasury, Report No. 2023-\n10-038, Review of the IRS Independent Office of Ap-\npeals Collection Due Process Program 7 (July 2023), \nperma.cc/DVL7-9HA8 (reporting 28,349 closed Section \n6330 cases in 2023).  Allowing those proceedings to con-\ntinue even when the IRS no longer seeks to levy on a \ntaxpayer\u2019s property could convert many of them from a \nlimited opportunity for pre-deprivation review into a \nmore general forum for considering challenges to tax li-\nability.  Nothing in the text or history of Section 6330 \nsupports that end-run around the calibrated statutory \nframework that generally provides for post-payment \nadjudication of disputes over tax liability. \nC. The Contrary Arguments Offered By Respondent And \nThe Court Of Appeals Lack Merit \nThe court of appeals recognized that \u201cthe Tax Court \nneed not hear a moot case.\u201d  Pet. App. 16a.  But the \ncourt held that a pre-levy proceeding under Section \n6330 does not become moot when the IRS \u201cwithdr[aws] \nits levy.\u201d  Id. at 25a.  That was error, and neither the \ncourt of appeals nor respondent has offered any persua-\nsive support for the court\u2019s holding. \n1. The Tax Court lacks jurisdiction to consider a tax-\npayer\u2019s \u201cunderlying tax liability\u201d when there is no \nlive dispute over a proposed levy \na. In a portion of its opinion joined by only two mem-\nbers of the panel, the court of appeals held that the Sec-\n\n25 \n \ntion 6330 proceeding in this case is not moot because re-\nspondent still disputes whether the IRS \u201cerroneously \nallocated\u201d the estimated payments to Gennardo rather \nthan respondent.  Pet. App. 19a.  The court relied on \nSection 6330(c)(2)(B), which, in certain circumstances, \nallows a taxpayer to raise at a Section 6330 hearing \u201cthe \nexistence or amount of the underlying tax liability.\u201d  26 \nU.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B).  Respondent likewise contends \n(Br. in Opp. 14) that the Tax Court may \u201cresolve any \ndispute about the taxpayer\u2019s underlying tax liability \nthat the taxpayer properly raised before the Appeals \nOffice\u201d\u2014even if the IRS no longer seeks to enforce the \nlevy that gave rise to the Section 6330 proceeding.3 \nThat argument ignores the text and context of Sec-\ntion 6330(c)(2)(B).  That provision comes into play \n \n3 The parties have disagreed about which subsection of Section \n6330 governs respondent\u2019s challenge to the IRS\u2019s allocation of  \nestimated payments.  See Pet. Reply Br. 4 n.2.  While respondent \nrelies on Section 6330(c)(2)(B)\u2019s reference to \u201cchallenges to the ex-\nistence or amount of the underlying tax liability,\u201d id. at 4, the gov-\nernment disputes that characterization because the liability  \nitself\u2014respondent\u2019s self-reported 2010 tax\u2014is not in question.  \nSee Gov\u2019t C.A. Supp. Br. 24-25.  Because respondent claims that the \nagreed-upon liability should have been paid through the estimated \npayments, the government views that argument as an \u201cissue relat-\ning to the unpaid tax.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(A); see Melasky v. Com-\nmissioner, 151 T.C. 89, 92 (2018) (\u201cA question about whether the \nIRS properly credited a payment is not a challenge to a tax liability; \ni.e., the amount of tax imposed by the Code for a particular year.  It \nis instead a question of whether the liability remains unpaid.\u201d).  The \nCourt need not, however, decide this dispute to resolve the question \npresented.  As discussed in the text, even under respondent\u2019s char-\nacterization, the Section 6330 proceeding in this case is moot be-\ncause a taxpayer may challenge her \u201cunderlying tax liability\u201d only \nin connection with a determination whether a proposed levy may \nproceed. \n\n26 \n \nwhere the taxpayer seeks to dispute an \u201cunderlying tax \nliability.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B).  For a \u201cliability\u201d to \nexist, the taxpayer must still owe a debt to the IRS.  See \nWebster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary of the \nEnglish Language 1302 (1993) (Webster\u2019s Third) (defin-\ning \u201cliability\u201d as \u201can amount that is owed whether pay-\nable in money, other property, or services\u201d); see also \nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary 1095 (12th ed. 2024) (defining \n\u201cliability\u201d as \u201c[a] financial or pecuniary obligation in a \nspecificed amount; DEBT <tax liability>\u201d).   \nCrucially, for a taxpayer\u2019s liability to be \u201cunderly-\ning,\u201d it must be \u201clying under or beneath,\u201d \u201cbe at the ba-\nsis of,\u201d or \u201cform the foundation of\u200a\u201d something else.  \nWebster\u2019s Third 2489 (definitions of \u201cunderlying\u201d and \n\u201cunderlie\u201d).  In the context of Section 6330, the tax lia-\nbility is \u201cunderlying\u201d the proposed \u201clevy actions which \nare the subject of the requested hearing.\u201d  26 U.S.C. \n6330(c)(2)(B) and (e)(1).  When there is not a proposed \nlevy, any dispute about tax liability ceases to be the \nfoundation for something else.  There is accordingly no \n\u201cunderlying tax liability\u201d for purposes of 26 U.S.C. \n6330(c)(2)(B). \nAs the Fourth Circuit has correctly explained, the \nphrase \u201cunderlying tax liability\u201d must be understood in \n\u201cthe specific context in which that language is used,\u201d \nand in Section 6330, \u201cthe \u2018specific context\u2019 is the IRS\u2019s \nattempt to collect via lien or levy.\u201d  McLane, 24 F.4th at \n319 (quoting Yates v. United States, 574 U.S. 528, 537 \n(2015)).  Where Section 6330(c)(2)(B) applies, a tax-\npayer may challenge the existence or amount of her \n\u201cunderlying tax liability,\u201d 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B)\u2014just \nas she may raise \u201cany relevant issue relating to the un-\npaid tax,\u201d 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(A).  But those challenges \nare available for purposes of informing the determina-\n\n27 \n \ntion whether the proposed levy may proceed.  The stat-\nute therefore requires the Appeals Office to \u201ctake\u201d \nthose factors \u201cinto consideration\u201d in making its \u201cdeter-\nmination\u201d about the levy.  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3).  And the \nTax Court will in turn review \u201csuch determination\u201d on \nappeal.  26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1).  If the Tax Court con-\ncludes that a taxpayer owes less than the IRS has cal-\nculated, that conclusion will affect the propriety of the \nproposed collection action because the IRS cannot col-\nlect more than is owed.    \nBut that is the extent of the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction \nunder Section 6330.  Section 6330 does not identify a \nchallenge to the taxpayer\u2019s \u201cunderlying tax liability\u201d as \na freestanding issue.  When the IRS is not seeking a levy, \nthere is no underlying liability, and Section 6330(c)(2)(B) \nhas no role to play.  In that instance, the taxpayer can-\nnot use a Section 6330 proceeding as an \u201cindependent \nbasis to challenge the existence or amount\u201d of her tax \ndebt, Greene-Thapedi, 126 T.C. at 8\u2014just as she could \nnot have used Section 6330 to seek such findings if no \nlevy had been proposed in the first place.  See McLane, \n24 F.4th at 319; Willson, 805 F.3d at 320-321; Byers, 740 \nF.3d at 679.   \nb. Echoing the court of appeals (Pet. App. 33a-36a), \nrespondent has suggested (Br. in Opp. 19) that her case \nis not moot because the Tax Court \u201chad authority to is-\nsue declaratory relief as to [her] underlying liability.\u201d  \nBut even where declaratory relief is generally available, \nit \u201cdoes not \u2018extend\u2019 the \u2018jurisdiction\u2019 of the federal \ncourts.\u201d  Medtronic, Inc. v. Mirowski Family Ventures, \nLLC, 571 U.S. 191, 197 (2014) (quoting Skelly Oil Co. v. \nPhillips Petroleum Co., 339 U.S. 667, 671 (1950)).  And \nhere, the Tax Court lacks the authority to provide the \ndeclaration that respondent seeks. \n\n28 \n \nCongress has granted only limited powers of declar-\natory relief with respect to federal taxes.  The Declara-\ntory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. 2201(a), bars declaratory \njudgments \u201cwith respect to Federal taxes other than ac-\ntions brought under section 7428 of the Internal Reve-\nnue Code of 1986.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2201(a); see ibid. (excluding \ncertain bankruptcy and duty-related proceedings).  Sec-\ntion 7428 grants authority to issue declaratory judgments, \nbut only with respect to tax-exempt status.  26 U.S.C. \n7428(a)(1) and (2).  Congress has also authorized the Tax \nCourt to issue declaratory relief in certain other con-\ntexts.  See 26 U.S.C. 7476-7479.  But none of those pro-\nvisions authorizes the Tax Court to issue declaratory \njudgments in a levy-review proceeding under Section \n6330.   \nRespondent contends (Br. in Opp. 23) that because \nSection 6330(e)(1) \u201cauthorizes\u201d the Tax Court to order \n\u201cinjunctive relief,\u201d it \u201cnecessarily * * *  authorizes de-\nclaratory relief\u200a\u201d as well.  See Pet. App. 35a-36a.  But \nrespondent\u2019s reasoning fails on its own terms.  Where \nthe IRS no longer seeks to enforce a levy, the court has \nno power to enjoin a levy under Section 6330(e).  See, \ne.g., Willson, 805 F.3d at 321.  Respondent therefore \ncannot bootstrap from the Tax Court\u2019s authority to is-\nsue an injunction the \u201cmilder\u201d authority to issue a de-\nclaratory judgment.  Br. in Opp. 23 (quoting Steffel v. \nThompson, 415 U.S. 452, 466-467 (1974)). \nMore generally, Section 6330(e)(1)\u2019s limited grant of \nauthority to enjoin a specific collection action during a \nlevy-review proceeding does not provide for Tax Court \njurisdiction over any administrative action other than \nthe proposed levy that is \u201cthe subject of the requested \nhearing.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(1).  That provision simply \nprovides courts with an enforcement mechanism to pre-\n\n29 \n \nvent the use of a particular administrative collection \ntool\u2014an administrative levy to collect a specific under-\nlying liability\u2014while the taxpayer is provided the op-\nportunity to mount a pre-deprivation challenge to that \nlevy.  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(A) and (e). \nReading the exception in Section 6330(e) to open the \ndoor to more general declaratory and injunctive relief \nwould be at odds with Congress\u2019s determination, as a \ngeneral rule, to \u201cpermit the United States to assess and \ncollect taxes alleged to be due without judicial interven-\ntion, and to require that the legal right to the disputed \nsums be determined in a suit for refund.\u201d  Enochs v. \nWilliams Packing & Navigation Co., 370 U.S. 1, 7 \n(1962) (citing 26 U.S.C. 7421(a)); see, e.g., Phillips v. \nCommissioner, 283 U.S. 589, 595-597 (1931).  Congress\u2019s \ndecision to suspend certain collection procedures while \nlevy-review proceedings are pending\u2014and to authorize \nthe Tax Court to enforce that suspension\u2014did not cre-\nate additional exceptions to the general rule.4 \nc. Respondent suggests that the Tax Court\u2019s limited \npre-deprivation jurisdiction survives the IRS\u2019s aban-\n \n4 The court of appeals declined to decide whether the Tax Court \nhas \u201coverpayment or refund jurisdiction in a context like this,\u201d Pet. \nApp. 34a n.38, and respondent has not raised that issue in this Court, \nsee Br. in Opp. 21.  There is no general grant of refund jurisdiction \nin the Tax Court.  See, e.g., United States ex rel. Girard Trust Co. \nv. Helvering, 301 U.S. 540, 542 (1937) (addressing the Tax Court\u2019s \npredecessor); Empire Ordinance Corp. v. Harrington, 249 F.2d \n680, 682 (D.C. Cir. 1957).  And while Congress has given the Tax \nCourt jurisdiction to determine an overpayment or refund in certain \nspecific proceedings, see 26 U.S.C. 6015(e) and (g), 6213, 6214(a), \n6404(h), 6512(b), it has not done so with respect to pre-levy chal-\nlenges under Section 6330, see, e.g., Brown v. Commissioner, 58 \nF.4th 1064, 1066-1067 (9th Cir. 2023); McLane, 24 F.4th at 319; Will-\nson, 805 F.3d at 321; Greene-Thapedi, 126 T.C. at 8, 12-13. \n\n30 \n \ndonment of its proposed levy because, in other contexts, \n\u201cjurisdiction \u2018depend[s] upon the state of things at the \ntime of the action brought.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Br. in Opp. 16 (quoting \nGrupo Dataflux v. Atlas Global Grp., L.P., 541 U.S. 567, \n570 (2004)).  But as the cases that respondent cites make \nclear, \u201cthat principle is not absolute.\u201d  Coba v. Ford Mo-\ntor Co., 932 F.3d 114, 119 (3d Cir. 2019).  Most \u201cnotably, \nwhere a case becomes moot in the course of the litiga-\ntion,\u201d a court cannot continue to adjudicate it.  Cun-\nningham Charter Corp. v. LearJet, Inc., 592 F.3d 805, \n810 (7th Cir. 2010).  That is the case here:  Section 6330 \nprovides the Tax Court with jurisdiction to review a \n\u201cdetermination\u201d whether a proposed levy may proceed.  \n26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3) and (d)(1).  When there is no longer \nany need for such a determination, there is no need for \nreview of such a determination, and the Section 6330 \nproceeding is moot. \nEven outside of mootness scenarios, this Court has \nrecognized that a court may be deprived of subject- \nmatter jurisdiction by developments that fundamen-\ntally alter the basis for a lawsuit, such as \u201cthe with-\ndrawal of [the original] allegations\u201d on which jurisdic-\ntion was based.  Rockwell Int\u2019l Corp. v. United States, \n549 U.S. 457, 473 (2007).  The Court recently applied \nthat principle in Royal Canin U.S.A., Inc. v. Wull-\nschleger, 604 U.S. 22 (2025).  There, the plaintiff filed a \ncomplaint in state court containing both federal- and \nstate-law claims, and the defendant removed the case to \nfederal court, invoking federal-question jurisdiction \n(over the federal-law claims) and supplemental jurisdic-\ntion (over the state-law claims).  Id. at 28-29.  After the \nremoval, the plaintiff amended her complaint to remove \nthe federal claims.  Id. at 29.  This Court recognized \nthat, at that point, the \u201cchanges in claims\u201d had \u201ceffec-\n\n31 \n \ntively rema[d]e the suit.\u201d   Id. at 35.  Because there were \nno longer any federal-law claims to which the consider-\nation of state-law claims could be considered supple-\nmental, the district court had ceased to have any \u201csup-\nplemental jurisdiction at all.\u201d  Id. at 34. \nThe same logic applies here.  The fundamental basis \nfor a Section 6330 proceeding is the taxpayer\u2019s claim \nthat the IRS should not be allowed to collect a tax lia-\nbility via levy.  See C.A. App. 24 (respondent\u2019s petition \nfor review in the Tax Court sought review of the \u201cdeter-\nmination  * * *  reflected in [the] Notice of Determina-\ntion Concerning Collection Action[s]\u201d in her case, which \n\u201csustained the validity and appropriateness of a Final \nNotice of Intent to Levy\u201d).  Respondent\u2019s overpayments \nof taxes in subsequent years\u2014and the IRS\u2019s resulting \ndetermination that it \u201cno longer needs nor intends to \ncollect [respondent\u2019s] income tax liability\u201d via levy, C.A. \nDoc. 5-4, at 450\u2014effectively remade the suit, eliminat-\ning the need to determine whether the levy could pro-\nceed and hence any need to decide the underlying tax \nliability.  The Tax Court accordingly ceased to have ju-\nrisdiction under Section 6330.   \n2. The Tax Court has no \u201cimplicit\u201d jurisdiction to  \nreview offsets in a Section 6330 proceeding  \nThe court of appeals alternatively held that this case \nis not moot because the Tax Court could review the \nIRS\u2019s allocation of respondent\u2019s later-year overpay-\nments to offset her 2010 tax liability.  Pet. App. 20a-25a.  \nIn so holding, the court of appeals reasoned that, while \n\u201cit may be that Congress has not explicitly granted the \nTax Court such power,\u201d there is nevertheless \u201can im-\nplicit grant\u201d of jurisdiction that \u201callows the [Tax] Court \nto review setoffs in any event.\u201d  Id. at 20a. \n\n32 \n \nRespondent did not defend that aspect of the court \nof appeals\u2019 decision in her brief in opposition.  And for \ngood reason.  Tax Court jurisdiction must be expressly \nconferred by statute.  See p. 16, supra; 26 U.S.C. 7442 \n(\u201cThe Tax Court and its divisions shall have such juris-\ndiction as is conferred on them by this title, by chapters \n1, 2, 3, and 4 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, by \ntitle II and title III of the Revenue Act of 1926 (44 Stat. \n10\u201387), or by laws enacted subsequent to February 26, \n1926.\u201d).  And no statute grants the Tax Court jurisdic-\ntion to review in a Section 6330 proceeding the IRS\u2019s \nexercise of authority under Section 6402(a) to credit (or \noffset) a taxpayer\u2019s overpayments against her tax liabil-\nity.  To the contrary, Section 6330 grants the Tax Court \njurisdiction only to review\u2014and, if necessary, enjoin\u2014\nthe \u201clevy action[]\u201d that is the \u201csubject of the requested \nhearing.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(1).  It does not affect the \nIRS\u2019s ability to take other enforcement actions, includ-\ning the authority to credit overpayments against exist-\ning liabilities under Section 6402; nor does it grant the \nTax Court jurisdiction to review such actions.  See 26 \nC.F.R. 301.6330\u20131(g)(2), Q & A-G3; see also Belloff v. \nCommissioner, 996 F.2d 607, 616 (2d Cir. 1993).  Courts \nhave therefore repeatedly held that the Tax Court lacks \njurisdiction to review Section 6402(a) credits in a Sec-\ntion 6330 proceeding.  See, e.g., Boyd v. Commissioner, \n451 F.3d 8, 10-11 (1st Cir. 2006); Greene-Thapedi, 126 \nT.C. at 7-8.   \nMoreover, even if the Tax Court had jurisdiction to \nreview the application of credits under Section 6402 in \na Section 6330 proceeding, the court of appeals\u2019 moot-\nness holding would still be erroneous.  The court of ap-\npeals reasoned that the Tax Court has jurisdiction to \nreview the IRS\u2019s use of respondent\u2019s overpayments to \n\n33 \n \noffset her tax liability, and that those offsets were inva-\nlid, such that respondent should be deemed to have an \noutstanding tax liability for 2010.  Pet. App. 20a-25a.  \nAnd the court of appeals took the view that the Tax \nCourt therefore has jurisdiction to consider respond-\nent\u2019s challenge to \u201cthe IRS\u2019s application of the esti-\nmated payments\u201d to Gennardo rather than respondent.  \nPet. App. 19a.  But the Tax Court would have jurisdic-\ntion under Section 6330 to consider such a challenge \nonly in connection with a live dispute over a proposed \nlevy.  See pp. 16-31, supra.  And the IRS has no basis \nfor pursuing a levy so long as respondent\u2019s overpay-\nments remain \u201cin the government\u2019s pocket.\u201d  Pet. App. \n25a.  Nor did the court of appeals conclude that the Tax \nCourt could order the IRS to refund those overpay-\nments.  See p. 29 n.4, supra.  Thus, even if the applica-\ntion of credits was invalid\u2014and it was not5\u2014the Section \n6330 proceeding would still be moot at this point.  \nD. The Instant Case Is Moot \nApplying the foregoing principles, respondent\u2019s case \nis moot.  In 2012, respondent self-reported to the IRS \nthat she owed $21,918 in taxes for tax year 2010.  C.A. \nApp. 475.  The IRS assessed liability based on respond-\nent\u2019s representation.  Id. at 280; see 26 U.S.C. 6201(a)(1).  \nWhen the IRS then proposed to collect the liability by \n \n5 The court of appeals concluded that the application of credits vi-\nolated the common-law rule that \u201ca creditor cannot set off a disputed \ndebt with an undisputed one.\u201d  Pet. App. 22a.  But that rule has no \napplication under Section 6402(a), which authorizes the IRS to \n\u201ccredit the amount of [an] overpayment  * * *  against any liability,\u201d \nundisputed or not.  26 U.S.C. 6402(a).  The court also reasoned that \nthe application of credits violated \u201cArticle III mootness principles.\u201d  \nPet. App. 25a.  But no such principles limit the IRS\u2019s exercise of \nstatutory authority under Section 6402(a). \n\n34 \n \nadministrative levy, respondent timely requested a pre-\ndeprivation hearing under Section 6330 to argue that \ncertain estimated tax payments should be applied to her \naccount, which would have (more than) satisfied her re-\nported tax liability, such that the proposed levy could \nnot go forward.  C.A. App. 566.   \nDuring the pendency of her pre-levy proceedings, re-\nspondent made overpayments for subsequent tax years, \nand, under Section 6402(a), the IRS credited those new \npayments against respondent\u2019s 2010 liability.  With no \nunpaid tax remaining on respondent\u2019s underlying liabil-\nity, there is no basis to proceed with the levy that re-\nspondent had challenged.  In these circumstances, there \nis no live dispute subject to Section 6330, and the Tax \nCourt can grant no further relief in a Section 6330 pro-\nceeding.  The case is therefore moot.   \nContrary to respondent\u2019s suggestion, that result \ndoes not violate \u201cthe presumption favoring judicial re-\nview of administrative action.\u201d  Br. in Opp. 23 (citation \nomitted).  As respondent has acknowledged (id. at 2, 4, \n13, 16, 25), a holding that her Section 6330 proceeding \nis moot will not foreclose her from seeking judicial re-\nview because she could file a refund suit\u2014the tradi-\ntional mechanism for disputing the assessment or col-\nlection of a federal tax, and the one that is available re-\ngardless of whether the IRS had ever proposed to levy \non respondent\u2019s property.  See 26 U.S.C. 7422(a); 28 \nU.S.C. 1346(a)(1); see also 26 U.S.C. 7422(d) (deeming \noverpayment credits to be \u201cpayment[s]\u201d for purposes of \na refund suit).  This Court should hew to Section 6330\u2019s \nplain text, which limits the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to a \ndispute over a proposed levy. \n\n35 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThis Court should reverse the judgment of the court \nof appeals. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nSARAH M.

The answer is yes. The Tax Court has juris-\ndiction under Internal Revenue Code \u00a7 6330(d)(1) to \nreview the Appeals Office\u2019s determination and the \nmatters and issues that determination resolves, and \nnothing in \u00a7 6330 conditions that jurisdiction on the \nIRS\u2019s continuing pursuit of a levy. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1); \nsee I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c). The Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to re-\nview the Appeals Office\u2019s determination thus gives the \ncourt authority to rule on the taxpayer\u2019s unpaid tax or \nunderlying liability. And because the government is \nexpected to abide by judicial rulings, those rulings \nwould redress Zuch\u2019s pocketbook injury. This case is \nnot moot. \nJennifer Zuch owed about $27,000 for the 2010 tax \nyear. But she and her ex-husband had already made \n$50,000 in estimated payments to the IRS for the 2010 \ntax year, and Zuch asked the IRS to apply those pay-\nments to her tax bill. Zuch\u2019s ex-husband agreed that \nthose tax payments should be applied to Zuch\u2019s tax \nbill. But the IRS refused. Instead, it applied the full \n$50,000 in estimated payments to Zuch\u2019s ex-husband\u2019s \nbalance. It then threatened to seize Zuch\u2019s property to \ncollect her 2010 tax assessment. \nZuch exercised her right to a hearing under \n\u00a7 6330, which provides taxpayers with procedural pro-\ntections before the IRS may levy their property to \ncollect taxes. Congress enacted \u00a7 6330 as part of the \nInternal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform \n\n2 \n \n \nAct in response to abusive IRS collections practices \nthat forced some taxpayers to spend their life\u2019s sav-\nings on taxes the IRS or courts later determined they \nnever even owed. Practices & Procedures of the Inter-\nnal Revenue Service: Hearings Before the Committee \non Finance, 105th Cong., S. Hrg. 105-190 at 75-82 \n(1997) [hereinafter Hearings Before the Committee on \nFinance] (statement of Katherine Lund Hicks). Sec-\ntion 6330 ensures that taxpayers can dispute their tax \nbill before having to pay. The provision allows taxpay-\ners threatened with a levy to initiate administrative \nhearings before the Appeals Office and to raise \u201cany \nrelevant issue relating to the unpaid tax\u201d or challenge \ntheir liability if they haven\u2019t yet had a chance to do so. \nI.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2). Section 6330 also grants taxpayers \nan opportunity for meaningful judicial review by \ngranting the Tax Court jurisdiction to review the Ap-\npeals Office\u2019s determination. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). \nAt her administrative hearing, Zuch argued that \nthe IRS should have credited her with the $50,000 in \nestimated payments that she and her ex-husband had \nmade. Those payments would have covered her 2010 \ntax bill and entitled her to a refund. The Appeals Of-\nfice disagreed, concluding that Zuch was not entitled \nto any portion of the estimated payments and uphold-\ning the proposed levy. Zuch petitioned the Tax Court \nfor review of the Appeals Office\u2019s determination. But \nduring the course of the Tax Court proceedings, the \nIRS kept overpayments that Zuch made for later tax \nyears and used them to offset her disputed 2010 lia-\nbility. By 2019, after six years of litigation, the IRS \nclaimed that Zuch had satisfied the disputed liability, \nand it moved to dismiss the Tax Court proceedings as \nmoot. \n\n3 \n \n \nThe Tax Court agreed and dismissed the petition. \nAccording to the court, because there was no unpaid \nliability and no levy, the case was moot. Pet. App. 43a. \nThe court of appeals vacated and remanded. In a \npart of the opinion joined by two panel members, the \ncourt held that the case was not moot because the Tax \nCourt had jurisdiction to review the Appeals Office\u2019s \ndetermination of and declare Zuch\u2019s liability. Pet. \nApp. 25a-26a; see Pet. App. 25a-38a. And a declara-\ntory judgment, the court concluded, would redress \nZuch\u2019s injury. Pet. App. 37a-38a. \nThe court of appeals correctly recognized that the \nTax Court had jurisdiction to review the Appeals Of-\nfice\u2019s determination and that this case is not moot. \nThis Court should affirm. \n1. a. The Tax Court had, and retained, jurisdic-\ntion to review the Appeals Office\u2019s determination. \nSection 6330\u2019s plain text states that the Tax Court \n\u201cshall have jurisdiction\u201d to \u201creview\u201d the Appeals Of-\nfice\u2019s \u201cdetermination,\u201d including its resolution of \u201cany \nrelevant issue relating to the unpaid tax,\u201d or the tax-\npayer\u2019s \u201cunderlying tax liability.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2), \n(c)(3), (d)(1). Nothing in that language, or anything \nelse in \u00a7 6330, requires an ongoing attempt to levy the \ntaxpayer\u2019s property. Thus, the Tax Court retains ju-\nrisdiction \nto \nreview \nthe \nAppeals \nOffice\u2019s \ndetermination, even if the IRS stops pursuing a levy, \nso long as the taxpayer continues to dispute her un-\npaid tax or underlying liability. That makes sense, \ngiven that the whole point of \u00a7 6330 is to make sure \nthat levy proceedings are fair and that a taxpayer can \nchallenge her liability if she had no prior opportunity \nto do so. Indeed, the very design of \u00a7 6330 seeks to en-\nsure that the government is \u201cturn[ing] square corners \n\n4 \n \n \nin dealing with the people,\u201d Department of Homeland \nSecurity v. Regents of the University of California, 591 \nU.S. 1, 24 (2020).  \nb. This case is not moot. The Tax Court had au-\nthority to determine Zuch\u2019s entitlement to the \nprepayments. See I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). A case is moot \nonly when the parties no longer retain any interest in \nthe outcome of the proceedings. But here, both parties \nhave a concrete interest in the outcome of the litiga-\ntion: If Zuch wins, the IRS will likely refund her \nmoney. If the IRS wins, it will keep her money. Either \nway, the Tax Court\u2019s ruling will be preclusive in a re-\nfund suit\u2014which the government has invited Zuch to \nfile\u2014so the stakes are real. And Zuch has now filed a \nrefund suit in the District of New Jersey seeking to \nrecover some of her overpayments. \n2. The IRS\u2019s counterarguments are meritless. \nThe IRS claims that the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to re-\nview the Appeals Office\u2019s determination vanished, and \nthat the case is moot, because the IRS decided it no \nlonger needed a levy after it took Zuch\u2019s money an-\nother way. The government\u2019s arguments fail.  \nFirst, the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to review \nwhether Zuch was entitled to the prepayments didn\u2019t \ndisappear once the IRS stopped pursuing the levy. \nPlain text makes that clear. Although the term \u201clevy\u201d \nappears throughout \u00a7 6330, the provision that grants \nthe Tax Court jurisdiction over the Appeals Office\u2019s \ndetermination\u2014\u00a7 6330(d)(1)\u2014doesn\u2019t condition juris-\ndiction on a levy. History and purpose don\u2019t help the \ngovernment, either. Congress enacted \u00a7 6330 to rem-\nedy IRS abuses and give taxpayers a fair shot at \ndisputing what they owe before collection, underscor-\ning why Congress likely wanted the Tax Court to \n\n5 \n \n \nretain jurisdiction to resolve disputes over unpaid tax \nand liability. Section 6330 must be construed in light \nof that remedial purpose.  \nInvoking Royal Canin U.S.A., Inc. v. Wullschleger, \n604 U.S. 22 (2025), the government claims that the \nTax Court lost jurisdiction because the IRS fundamen-\ntally altered the basis of the suit when it decided not \nto seek the levy. But again, \u00a7 6330 gave the Tax Court \njurisdiction to review an Appeals Office determination \nand nothing in the provision requires a levy. See I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1). Put differently, \u00a7 6330(d) gives the Tax \nCourt jurisdiction so long as the taxpayer challenges \nan Appeals Office determination. The Court recently \nmade clear in the \u00a7 6330 context that a procedural re-\nquirement is jurisdictional only if Congress \u201cclearly \nstates\u201d that it is. Boechler, P.C. v. Commissioner, 596 \nU.S. 199, 203 (2022). But the word \u201clevy\u201d doesn\u2019t even \nappear in \u00a7 6330(d). In any event, even if \u00a7 6330 re-\nquired a levy, the requirement would look to the time \nof filing, and there was a proposed levy when Zuch pe-\ntitioned the Tax Court.  \nAppealing to policy, the government says that if \nthe Tax Court has jurisdiction to review liability dis-\nputes like Zuch\u2019s, the Tax Court will become a forum \nfor general liability claims. For starters, the govern-\nment hasn\u2019t pointed to any cases showing that \ntaxpayers are invoking \u00a7 6330 to bring general liabil-\nity challenges. Plus, to invoke the Tax Court\u2019s \u00a7 6330 \njurisdiction, a taxpayer needs an Appeals Office deter-\nmination. The Tax Court can address unpaid tax or \nliability issues only if the Appeals Office\u2019s determina-\ntion resolved them. What\u2019s more, the question \npresented in this case rarely arises, and when it does, \nit\u2019s only because the IRS starts levy proceedings, gets \nthe taxpayer\u2019s money another way, and once the Tax \n\n6 \n \n \nCourt is reviewing the determination, decides to aban-\ndon the levy midstream. The IRS can easily avoid its \nself-made problem.  \nSecond, the government asserts that the Tax \nCourt lacks authority to declare Zuch\u2019s entitlement to \nthe prepayments because the Declaratory Judgment \nAct (DJA) and Anti-Injunction Act (AIA) generally \nprohibit courts from issuing declaratory and injunc-\ntive relief in federal tax cases. That argument fails. \nSection 6330(d)(1) authorizes the Tax Court to deter-\nmine the taxpayer\u2019s unpaid tax and underlying \nliability in \u00a7 6330 proceedings. And \u00a7 6330(e)(1) con-\nfirms that the Tax Court can issue declaratory relief, \nexempting \u00a7 6330 proceedings from the DJA\u2019s and \nAIA\u2019s prohibitions on declaratory and injunctive relief \nin other tax cases.  \nFinally, the government claims it mooted the case \nby abandoning the levy because the levy gave rise to \nthe proceeding. But that\u2019s not how moot\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

See I.R.C. \u00a7 6330. At the hearing, the \ntaxpayer may raise \u201cany relevant issue relating to the \nunpaid \ntax \nor \nthe \nproposed \nlevy.\u201d \nI.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A). The taxpayer may also challenge her \nunderlying tax liability if she did not previously have \nan opportunity to do so. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B). The Ap-\npeals Office issues a \u201cdetermination,\u201d which \u201cshall \ntake into consideration\u201d \u201cthe issues raised under par-\nagraph (2),\u201d including any challenge relating to the \nunpaid tax or the taxpayer\u2019s liability. I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(c)(3).

Miller, \nFederal Practice and Procedure \n(3d ed. updated June 2024) ................................... 30 \n \n\n1 \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThis case is about whether the Tax Court retains \njurisdiction to review an IRS administrative decision \ndetermining a taxpayer\u2019s disputed liability or unpaid \ntax after the IRS unilaterally tries to moot the chal-\nlenge by terminating its efforts to levy the taxpayer\u2019s \nproperty. The answer is yes. The Tax Court has juris-\ndiction under Internal Revenue Code \u00a7 6330(d)(1) to \nreview the Appeals Office\u2019s determination and the \nmatters and issues that determination resolves, and \nnothing in \u00a7 6330 conditions that jurisdiction on the \nIRS\u2019s continuing pursuit of a levy. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1); \nsee I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c). The Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to re-\nview the Appeals Office\u2019s determination thus gives the \ncourt authority to rule on the taxpayer\u2019s unpaid tax or \nunderlying liability. And because the government is \nexpected to abide by judicial rulings, those rulings \nwould redress Zuch\u2019s pocketbook injury. This case is \nnot moot. \nJennifer Zuch owed about $27,000 for the 2010 tax \nyear. But she and her ex-husband had already made \n$50,000 in estimated payments to the IRS for the 2010 \ntax year, and Zuch asked the IRS to apply those pay-\nments to her tax bill. Zuch\u2019s ex-husband agreed that \nthose tax payments should be applied to Zuch\u2019s tax \nbill. But the IRS refused. Instead, it applied the full \n$50,000 in estimated payments to Zuch\u2019s ex-husband\u2019s \nbalance. It then threatened to seize Zuch\u2019s property to \ncollect her 2010 tax assessment. \nZuch exercised her right to a hearing under \n\u00a7 6330, which provides taxpayers with procedural pro-\ntections before the IRS may levy their property to \ncollect taxes. Congress enacted \u00a7 6330 as part of the \nInternal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform \n\n2 \n \n \nAct in response to abusive IRS collections practices \nthat forced some taxpayers to spend their life\u2019s sav-\nings on taxes the IRS or courts later determined they \nnever even owed. Practices & Procedures of the Inter-\nnal Revenue Service: Hearings Before the Committee \non Finance, 105th Cong., S. Hrg. 105-190 at 75-82 \n(1997) [hereinafter Hearings Before the Committee on \nFinance] (statement of Katherine Lund Hicks). Sec-\ntion 6330 ensures that taxpayers can dispute their tax \nbill before having to pay. The provision allows taxpay-\ners threatened with a levy to initiate administrative \nhearings before the Appeals Office and to raise \u201cany \nrelevant issue relating to the unpaid tax\u201d or challenge \ntheir liability if they haven\u2019t yet had a chance to do so. \nI.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2). Section 6330 also grants taxpayers \nan opportunity for meaningful judicial review by \ngranting the Tax Court jurisdiction to review the Ap-\npeals Office\u2019s determination. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). \nAt her administrative hearing, Zuch argued that \nthe IRS should have credited her with the $50,000 in \nestimated payments that she and her ex-husband had \nmade. Those payments would have covered her 2010 \ntax bill and entitled her to a refund. The Appeals Of-\nfice disagreed, concluding that Zuch was not entitled \nto any portion of the estimated payments and uphold-\ning the proposed levy. Zuch petitioned the Tax Court \nfor review of the Appeals Office\u2019s determination. But \nduring the course of the Tax Court proceedings, the \nIRS kept overpayments that Zuch made for later tax \nyears and used them to offset her disputed 2010 lia-\nbility. By 2019, after six years of litigation, the IRS \nclaimed that Zuch had satisfied the disputed liability, \nand it moved to dismiss the Tax Court proceedings as \nmoot. \n\n3 \n \n \nThe Tax Court agreed and dismissed the petition. \nAccording to the court, because there was no unpaid \nliability and no levy, the case was moot. Pet. App. 43a. \nThe court of appeals vacated and remanded. In a \npart of the opinion joined by two panel members, the \ncourt held that the case was not moot because the Tax \nCourt had jurisdiction to review the Appeals Office\u2019s \ndetermination of and declare Zuch\u2019s liability. Pet. \nApp. 25a-26a; see Pet. App. 25a-38a. And a declara-\ntory judgment, the court concluded, would redress \nZuch\u2019s injury. Pet. App. 37a-38a. \nThe court of appeals correctly recognized that the \nTax Court had jurisdiction to review the Appeals Of-\nfice\u2019s determination and that this case is not moot. \nThis Court should affirm. \n1. a. The Tax Court had, and retained, jurisdic-\ntion to review the Appeals Office\u2019s determination. \nSection 6330\u2019s plain text states that the Tax Court \n\u201cshall have jurisdiction\u201d to \u201creview\u201d the Appeals Of-\nfice\u2019s \u201cdetermination,\u201d including its resolution of \u201cany \nrelevant issue relating to the unpaid tax,\u201d or the tax-\npayer\u2019s \u201cunderlying tax liability.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2), \n(c)(3), (d)(1). Nothing in that language, or anything \nelse in \u00a7 6330, requires an ongoing attempt to levy the \ntaxpayer\u2019s property. Thus, the Tax Court retains ju-\nrisdiction \nto \nreview \nthe \nAppeals \nOffice\u2019s \ndetermination, even if the IRS stops pursuing a levy, \nso long as the taxpayer continues to dispute her un-\npaid tax or underlying liability. That makes sense, \ngiven that the whole point of \u00a7 6330 is to make sure \nthat levy proceedings are fair and that a taxpayer can \nchallenge her liability if she had no prior opportunity \nto do so. Indeed, the very design of \u00a7 6330 seeks to en-\nsure that the government is \u201cturn[ing] square corners \n\n4 \n \n \nin dealing with the people,\u201d Department of Homeland \nSecurity v. Regents of the University of California, 591 \nU.S. 1, 24 (2020).  \nb. This case is not moot. The Tax Court had au-\nthority to determine Zuch\u2019s entitlement to the \nprepayments. See I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). A case is moot \nonly when the parties no longer retain any interest in \nthe outcome of the proceedings. But here, both parties \nhave a concrete interest in the outcome of the litiga-\ntion: If Zuch wins, the IRS will likely refund her \nmoney. If the IRS wins, it will keep her money. Either \nway, the Tax Court\u2019s ruling will be preclusive in a re-\nfund suit\u2014which the government has invited Zuch to \nfile\u2014so the stakes are real. And Zuch has now filed a \nrefund suit in the District of New Jersey seeking to \nrecover some of her overpayments. \n2. The IRS\u2019s counterarguments are meritless. \nThe IRS claims that the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to re-\nview the Appeals Office\u2019s determination vanished, and \nthat the case is moot, because the IRS decided it no \nlonger needed a levy after it took Zuch\u2019s money an-\nother way. The government\u2019s arguments fail.  \nFirst, the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to review \nwhether Zuch was entitled to the prepayments didn\u2019t \ndisappear once the IRS stopped pursuing the levy. \nPlain text makes that clear. Although the term \u201clevy\u201d \nappears throughout \u00a7 6330, the provision that grants \nthe Tax Court jurisdiction over the Appeals Office\u2019s \ndetermination\u2014\u00a7 6330(d)(1)\u2014doesn\u2019t condition juris-\ndiction on a levy. History and purpose don\u2019t help the \ngovernment, either. Congress enacted \u00a7 6330 to rem-\nedy IRS abuses and give taxpayers a fair shot at \ndisputing what they owe before collection, underscor-\ning why Congress likely wanted the Tax Court to \n\n5 \n \n \nretain jurisdiction to resolve disputes over unpaid tax \nand liability. Section 6330 must be construed in light \nof that remedial purpose.  \nInvoking Royal Canin U.S.A., Inc. v. Wullschleger, \n604 U.S. 22 (2025), the government claims that the \nTax Court lost jurisdiction because the IRS fundamen-\ntally altered the basis of the suit when it decided not \nto seek the levy. But again, \u00a7 6330 gave the Tax Court \njurisdiction to review an Appeals Office determination \nand nothing in the provision requires a levy. See I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1). Put differently, \u00a7 6330(d) gives the Tax \nCourt jurisdiction so long as the taxpayer challenges \nan Appeals Office determination. The Court recently \nmade clear in the \u00a7 6330 context that a procedural re-\nquirement is jurisdictional only if Congress \u201cclearly \nstates\u201d that it is. Boechler, P.C. v. Commissioner, 596 \nU.S. 199, 203 (2022). But the word \u201clevy\u201d doesn\u2019t even \nappear in \u00a7 6330(d). In any event, even if \u00a7 6330 re-\nquired a levy, the requirement would look to the time \nof filing, and there was a proposed levy when Zuch pe-\ntitioned the Tax Court.  \nAppealing to policy, the government says that if \nthe Tax Court has jurisdiction to review liability dis-\nputes like Zuch\u2019s, the Tax Court will become a forum \nfor general liability claims. For starters, the govern-\nment hasn\u2019t pointed to any cases showing that \ntaxpayers are invoking \u00a7 6330 to bring general liabil-\nity challenges. Plus, to invoke the Tax Court\u2019s \u00a7 6330 \njurisdiction, a taxpayer needs an Appeals Office deter-\nmination. The Tax Court can address unpaid tax or \nliability issues only if the Appeals Office\u2019s determina-\ntion resolved them. What\u2019s more, the question \npresented in this case rarely arises, and when it does, \nit\u2019s only because the IRS starts levy proceedings, gets \nthe taxpayer\u2019s money another way, and once the Tax \n\n6 \n \n \nCourt is reviewing the determination, decides to aban-\ndon the levy midstream. The IRS can easily avoid its \nself-made problem.  \nSecond, the government asserts that the Tax \nCourt lacks authority to declare Zuch\u2019s entitlement to \nthe prepayments because the Declaratory Judgment \nAct (DJA) and Anti-Injunction Act (AIA) generally \nprohibit courts from issuing declaratory and injunc-\ntive relief in federal tax cases. That argument fails. \nSection 6330(d)(1) authorizes the Tax Court to deter-\nmine the taxpayer\u2019s unpaid tax and underlying \nliability in \u00a7 6330 proceedings. And \u00a7 6330(e)(1) con-\nfirms that the Tax Court can issue declaratory relief, \nexempting \u00a7 6330 proceedings from the DJA\u2019s and \nAIA\u2019s prohibitions on declaratory and injunctive relief \nin other tax cases.  \nFinally, the government claims it mooted the case \nby abandoning the levy because the levy gave rise to \nthe proceeding. But that\u2019s not how mootness works. \nThe question is whether the parties retain any inter-\nest in the outcome of the litigation. And here, both \nZuch and the IRS have a concrete interest in whether \nand how the Tax Court adjudicates Zuch\u2019s entitlement \nto the estimated payments. \nThe Court should affirm the court of appeals\u2019 de-\ncision and remand so the Tax Court can consider \nZuch\u2019s merits arguments. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal background \n1. Taxpayers often have various ways to dispute \nthe amount of income taxes and other taxes the IRS \nclaims they owe. If the IRS determines that a taxpayer \nowes more taxes than she reported on her tax return, \n\n7 \n \n \nthe IRS typically sends her a notice of deficiency. \nI.R.C. \u00a7 6212(a). Within 90 days, the taxpayer may \nchallenge the claimed deficiency in Tax Court. I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6213(a). In the deficiency proceeding, the Tax Court \ncan determine the correct amount of tax owed and \nwhether the taxpayer made overpayments, entitling \nthe taxpayer to a refund or credit. I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6214(a), \n6512(b)(1). The Tax Court\u2019s final decision is reviewa-\nble by a court of appeals. I.R.C. \u00a7 7482(a)(1). If the \ntaxpayer does not challenge the deficiency, she can \npay the disputed amount and seek a refund in district \ncourt or the Court of Federal Claims. 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1346(a)(1); see I.R.C. \u00a7 7422(a).  \n2. This case centers on a third way a taxpayer \ncan challenge the taxes the IRS assesses when the \ntaxpayer has not paid the taxes the IRS claims she \nowes and the IRS seeks to collect by levying the tax-\npayer\u2019s property. Sometimes, a tax remains unpaid \neven after a taxpayer receives a notice of deficiency. \nOr perhaps a taxpayer hasn\u2019t paid the amount the IRS \nclaims she owes, but she didn\u2019t receive a notice of de-\nficiency or otherwise have an opportunity to dispute \nher liability. In either situation, the IRS may decide \nto pursue a levy on the taxpayer\u2019s property. I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6331(a), (b). \nIf the IRS issues a levy notice, the taxpayer has 30 \ndays to request an administrative hearing before the \nAppeals Office under I.R.C. \u00a7 6330, sometimes called \na \u201ccollection due process\u201d hearing, to challenge the \nproposed levy and her underlying tax liability. I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(b), (c)(2)(B); see Boechler, 596 U.S. at 202; \nByers v. Commissioner, 740 F.3d 668, 671-72 (D.C. \nCir. 2014). This case involves a \u00a7 6330 proceeding in \nwhich the parties dispute the taxpayer\u2019s liability and \nunpaid tax.  \n\n8 \n \n \na. The issues a taxpayer may raise in a collection \ndue process hearing depend in part on whether the \ntaxpayer received a notice of deficiency or had another \nopportunity to dispute her liability. If she did not, she \nmay raise \u201cchallenges to the existence or amount\u201d of \nher liability. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B). A collection due \nprocess hearing thus serves as a backstop, ensuring \nthat a taxpayer has an opportunity to dispute her un-\nderlying tax liability because she was not able to do so \nearlier. Liability challenges aside, all taxpayers in col-\nlection due process proceedings may raise \u201cany \nrelevant issue relating to the unpaid tax or the pro-\nposed levy, including\u201d \u201cappropriate spousal defenses,\u201d \n\u201cchallenges to the appropriateness of collection ac-\ntions,\u201d and \u201coffers of collection alternatives,\u201d no \nmatter whether they had an earlier opportunity to dis-\npute their liability. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A). The Appeals \nOffice then makes a \u201cdetermination\u201d that \u201cshall take \ninto consideration\u201d the taxpayer\u2019s challenge to the un-\npaid tax, her underlying liability, and any other issues \nraised. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(3). \nAlthough it is an important backstop, a collection \ndue process hearing \u201clacks the typical hallmarks of a \njudicial hearing\u201d and is \u201cfar from \u2026 a formal hearing.\u201d \nFarhy v. Commissioner, 100 F.4th 223, 227 (D.C. Cir. \n2024). \u201cThere are no formal discovery procedures, and \nthe taxpayer has no right to subpoena documents or \nwitnesses.\u201d Id. Rather, the hearing \u201cprovides the tax-\npayer \u2018an opportunity for an informal oral or written \nconversation with the IRS.\u2019\u201d Id. \nAfter the Appeals Office issues its \u201cdetermina-\ntion,\u201d the taxpayer may \u201cpetition the Tax Court for \nreview of such determination (and the Tax Court shall \nhave jurisdiction with respect to such matter).\u201d I.R.C. \n\n9 \n \n \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1). The Tax Court\u2019s final judgment is subject \nto review in a court of appeals. I.R.C. \u00a7 7482(a)(1). \nb. Congress enacted \u00a7 6330 in 1998 to protect \ntaxpayers from the IRS\u2019s abusive tax collection prac-\ntices. E.g., 144 Cong. Rec. S4027-32 (daily ed. May 1, \n1998). Leading up to \u00a7 6330\u2019s enactment, Congress \nheld a series of hearings that shed light on those prac-\ntices. For example, taxpayers couldn\u2019t contest a levy \nbefore the IRS seized their property. See Phillips v. \nCommissioner, 283 U.S. 589, 595-96 (1931). And tax-\npayers were often forced to drain their life\u2019s savings\u2014\nand their family\u2019s\u2014to pay assessments they never \neven owed. Hearings Before the Committee on Finance \nat 75-82 (statement of Katherine Lund Hicks). After \nthe hearings, \u201c[m]any people were shocked to learn \nthat a number of the due-process protections Ameri-\ncans take for granted in other legal proceedings do not \napply to actions involving the IRS.\u201d 144 Cong. Rec. \nS4031 (statement of Sen. Enzi). As one member put it, \n\u201cthe problem is, [the IRS] ha[s] too much power, they \nhave no checks and balances.\u201d Hearings Before the \nCommittee on Finance at 56 (statement of Sen. \nGramm). \nIn designing \u00a7 6330, Congress sought to \u201censure \nthat all taxpayers have due process and that the IRS \ndoes not abusively use its liens-and-seizure author-\nity.\u201d 143 Cong. Rec. S12231 (daily ed. Nov. 9, 1997) \n(statement of Sen. Roth). Indeed, the point of \u00a7 6330 \nproceedings is to \u201cincrease fairness to taxpayers\u201d be-\nfore the IRS deprives them of their property. S. Rep. \nNo. 105-174, at 67 (1998). And, as the Tax Court has \nobserved, Congress sought to ensure that the Commis-\nsioner would \u201ccollect the correct amount of tax, and do \nso by observing all applicable laws and administrative \n\n10 \n \n \nprocedures.\u201d Montgomery v. Commissioner, 122 T.C. \n1, 10 (2004). \nTo that end, \u00a7 6330 allows a taxpayer to raise is-\nsues relating to the unpaid tax and also challenge her \nliability if she did not have an earlier opportunity to \ndo so. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2). Section 6330 also gives the \ntaxpayer a chance \u201cto petition the Tax Court to contest \nthe Appeals [Office\u2019s] decision.\u201d 144 Cong. Rec. S4494 \n(daily ed. May 7, 1998) (statement of Sen. Hatch). And \nonce a taxpayer has petitioned the Tax Court, that \ncourt can enjoin any action or proceeding \u201cin respect \nof the unpaid tax or proposed levy.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(e)(1). \nThat makes sense: ensuring that the IRS is collecting \nthe correct amount of tax requires giving taxpayers an \nopportunity to dispute issues relating to the taxes \nthey haven\u2019t paid and their tax liability, and having \nthe Tax Court weigh in before the IRS can take their \nmoney. \nB. Factual and procedural background \nThis case arises from a dispute over whether the \nIRS properly credited $50,000 in overpayments from \nZuch and her ex-husband, Patrick Gennardo, to Gen-\nnardo\u2019s tax bill rather than Zuch\u2019s in the wake of their \ndivorce. Both Zuch and Gennardo maintain that the \nIRS should have credited Zuch\u2019s account, but the IRS \ninstead credited Gennardo\u2019s, sought to levy Zuch\u2019s \nproperty, and unilaterally decided to withhold over-\npayments Zuch made in later tax years. \n1. Zuch and Gennardo were married from 1993 \nto 2014. Pet. App. 7a. They separated in 2010, and \nZuch initiated divorce proceedings in 2012. CA3 \nApp. A118. During that time, the IRS assessed sub-\nstantial taxes against Zuch and Gennardo, prompting \nyears of litigation. \n\n11 \n \n \na. In 2010 and 2011, Zuch and Gennardo submit-\nted $50,000 in prepayments to the IRS for what they \nestimated would be their 2010 tax liability. Pet. \nApp. 8a. In particular, in June 2010, they submitted \nan estimated payment of $20,000 using a check drawn \nfrom a bank account listing both their names. Pet. \nApp. 8a & n.11. The form accompanying the check also \nlisted both names. Pet. App. 8a n.11, 51a. In January \n2011, Gennardo sent the IRS a check for $30,000. Pet. \nApp. 8a. The subject line of the letter accompanying \nthe check read \u201cRe: Patrick J. Gennardo and Jennifer \nZuch,\u201d and although the check was from Zuch and \nGennardo\u2019s joint bank account, the check listed only \nGennardo\u2019s name. Pet. App. 8a n.12, 51a. At the time, \nZuch and Gennardo didn\u2019t tell the IRS how to allocate \nthe payments. Pet. App. 8a. \nb. In 2012 and 2013, Zuch and Gennardo filed \nuntimely, and later amended, tax returns for 2010, \nand the IRS applied the $50,000 in prepayments to \nGennardo\u2019s, rather than Zuch\u2019s, tax bill. Pet. App. 7a-\n8a. The IRS\u2019s decision gave rise to the parties\u2019 dispute \nover Zuch\u2019s 2010 tax balance. \nIn September 2012, Zuch and Gennardo each filed \na married-filing-separately income tax return. Pet. \nApp. 7a. Zuch\u2019s return showed an adjusted gross in-\ncome of $74,493 and a $731 overpayment, and didn\u2019t \nmention the prepayments from 2010 and 2011. Pet. \nApp. 7a-8a & n.9. Gennardo\u2019s return showed an ad-\njusted gross income of $1,077,213, indicated that he \nowed $385,393 in taxes, and reported $10,000 in esti-\nmated payments. Pet. App. 8a-9a, 52a. The same day \nthat Gennardo filed his return, he also filed an offer-\nin-compromise, seeking to settle his accumulated tax \ndebts at less than the amount due. Id.; see I.R.C. \n\u00a7 7122(a). The IRS later notified him that it had \n\n12 \n \n \napplied the $50,000 in prepayments towards the \n$385,393 in taxes he owed. Pet. App. 8a. \nIn November 2012, Zuch filed an amended return \nfor 2010 to report $71,000 in additional income from a \nretirement account distribution. Pet. App. 9a. Zuch\u2019s \namended return showed that she owed the IRS \n$27,682. Id. She explained that the $50,000 in prepay-\nments should be credited to her and requested a \nrefund of $21,918. Id. In February 2013, the IRS as-\nsessed the additional $27,682 in taxes that Zuch \nreported, but it refused to credit her for the $50,000 or \nissue any refund. Id. \nGennardo also filed an amended return for 2010 \nin November 2012. Pet. App. 52a-53a. On that \namended return, he reported $0 in prepayments. Id. \nSubsequently, in March 2013, while his offer-in-com-\npromise was pending, Gennardo filed a second \namended return for 2010. Pet. App. 9a. He indicated \non that second amended return that the $50,000 in \nprepayments should be credited to Zuch, but the IRS \nstill refused to allocate it to her tax bill. Pet. App. 9a-\n10a; see Pet. App. 55a. \nc. Gennardo later submitted an amended offer-\nin-compromise in which he offered the IRS a signifi-\ncantly larger payment of tax, which the IRS accepted. \nPet. App. 10a. Even though Gennardo had asked the \nIRS to credit the $50,000 to Zuch, the IRS credited the \nentire sum to him. Id. \n2. Zuch never received a notice of deficiency from \nthe IRS. Pet. App. 9a n.13. But in August 2013, the \nIRS notified her that it intended to levy her property \nbecause she had failed to pay her 2010 tax assessment \nand explained that she had 30 days to request a \n\n13 \n \n \ncollection due process hearing before the Appeals Of-\nfice. Pet. App. 10a. \n3. Zuch timely requested a hearing. Id. At the \nhearing, Zuch challenged her \u201cunderlying tax liabil-\nity\u201d because she did not receive a notice of deficiency \nor otherwise have an opportunity to dispute it. I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B); Pet. App. 10a. Zuch argued that the \n$50,000 in prepayments should have been credited to \nher, reducing her tax liability to $0 and entitling her \nto a refund. Pet. App. 10a. \nIn September 2014, the Appeals Office rejected \nZuch\u2019s \u201c[c]hallenges to [her] [l]iability,\u201d Pet. App. 66a, \nand sustained the proposed levy. It told Zuch that it \nwas \u201cnot in a position\u201d to credit her for the $50,000 \nbecause the IRS had credited the money to Gennardo. \nPet. App. 11a. \n4. Zuch petitioned the Tax Court to review the \nAppeals Office\u2019s determination. Id. In particular, she \nsought a ruling that the $50,000 should have been ap-\nplied to her individual tax balance. Id. After the IRS \nmoved for summary judgment, the Tax Court re-\nmanded to the Appeals Office because it wasn\u2019t clear \nwhy the IRS had applied the $50,000 towards Gen-\nnardo\u2019s liability rather than Zuch\u2019s. Pet. App. 11a-\n12a. \n5. In June 2017, the Appeals Office again ruled \nagainst Zuch on the \u201c[i]ssues relating to [her] unpaid \n[underlying] liability,\u201d Pet. App. 48a, and sustained \nthe proposed levy, Pet. App. 12a. It reasoned that the \nlevy \u201cbalance[d] the need for efficient collection of \ntaxes with the taxpayer\u2019s legitimate concern that any \ncollection action be no more intrusive than necessary.\u201d \nCA3 App. A270. \n\n14 \n \n \n6. The case returned to the Tax Court. Pet. \nApp. 12a. Meanwhile, over the course of the six years \nthe \u00a7 6330 proceedings had been pending, Zuch kept \npaying her taxes for later years. In fact, she overpaid. \nBut rather than issuing her refunds, the IRS kept \nZuch\u2019s overpayments and used them to offset her \nclaimed 2010 liability. Pet. App. 12a-13a. The IRS did \nso six times, \u201conce each in 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2019, \nand twice in 2016.\u201d Id. And in April 2019, after the \ncase had returned to the Tax Court, the IRS kept \nZuch\u2019s money a final time to offset the rest of her \nclaimed 2010 tax balance, reducing it to $0. Pet. \nApp. 13a. \nThe IRS then moved to dismiss the Tax Court pro-\nceedings as moot. Id. The Tax Court granted the \nmotion. Id. The Tax Court concluded that it lacked ju-\nrisdiction over the case and that the case was moot \nbecause \u201cthere [was] no unpaid liability \u2026 upon which \na levy could be based,\u201d and the IRS was no longer \nseeking to levy Zuch\u2019s property. Pet. App. 43a. \n7. The Third Circuit vacated the Tax Court\u2019s de-\ncision, held that the Tax Court had jurisdiction under \n\u00a7 6330 to decide Zuch\u2019s challenge to her tax liability or \nunpaid tax, held that the case wasn\u2019t moot, and re-\nmanded for proceedings on the merits. Pet. App. 1a-\n39a. \nThe court first held that the Tax Court had juris-\ndiction to review the Appeals Office\u2019s determination of \nZuch\u2019s liability. Because Zuch had neither received a \nnotice of deficiency nor had an opportunity to contest \nher liability before her collection due process hearing, \nZuch could challenge \u201cthe existence or amount of [her] \nunderlying tax liability\u201d during the hearing. Pet. \nApp. 14a-15a; (quoting I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B)). And, \n\n15 \n \n \nthe court explained, \u201cZuch\u2019s argument that her esti-\nmated tax payments were erroneously allocated to her \nex-husband is a challenge to her underlying tax liabil-\nity under \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B).\u201d Pet. App. 19a. \nThe court of appeals then held that the Tax Court \nhad jurisdiction over Zuch\u2019s challenge, and that Zuch\u2019s \nchallenge was not moot, for two independent reasons. \nPet. App. 19a-38a. First, the court held that Zuch \ncould continue challenging her underlying liability be-\ncause the IRS unlawfully offset it using her \noverpayments in later years. Pet. App. 19a-25a. The \nIRS\u2019s unilateral, illegal actions, the court held, could \nnot moot the case. Pet. App. 25a. Second, in a part of \nthe opinion joined by two panel members, the court \nheld that the Tax Court had jurisdiction to review the \nAppeals Office\u2019s determination of Zuch\u2019s liability and \nissue a declaratory judgment because the parties con-\ntinued to dispute Zuch\u2019s tax liability. Pet. App. 25a-\n26a; see Pet. App. 25a-38a. And a declaratory judg-\nment, the court concluded, would redress Zuch\u2019s \ninjuries. Pet. App. 37a-38a. \n8. The IRS sought rehearing en banc, which the \ncourt of appeals denied. Pet. App. 68a-69a. It then \nsought a writ of certiorari, which this Court granted \non January 10, 2025. \n9. On March 14, 2025, Zuch filed a suit in the \nU.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey seek-\ning refunds for the 2010, 2012, 2013, and 2018 tax \nyears pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(a)(1) and I.R.C. \n\u00a7 7422(a). Compl., Zuch v. United States, No. 2:25-cv-\n01900 (D.N.J. Mar. 14, 2025). If successful, Zuch will \nrecover approximately two-thirds of the taxes the IRS \ncollected after it refused to credit her for the estimated \npayments. See Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 108-09. But Zuch is unable \n\n16 \n \n \nto request the return of approximately $20,000 in \noverpayments the IRS kept from the 2014 and 2015 \ntax years, due to the onerous jurisdictional prerequi-\nsites to filing a refund suit. Compl. \u00b6 109. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI. \nThe Tax Court had jurisdiction to review \nZuch\u2019s challenge relating to her unpaid tax or under-\nlying tax liability, and to adjudicate her entitlement \nto the estimated payments. The Tax Court retained \nthat jurisdiction and authority to issue a binding rul-\ning even after the IRS stopped pursuing the levy. This \ncase isn\u2019t moot.  \nA.  The Tax Court had, and retained, jurisdiction \nto review the Appeals Office\u2019s determination of Zuch\u2019s \nestimated payment dispute. \n1. Section 6330\u2019s plain text makes clear that the \nTax Court has authority to review the Appeals Office\u2019s \ndetermination of a taxpayer\u2019s challenge relating to her \nunpaid tax or underlying liability. Section 6330 pro-\nvides that a taxpayer may raise \u201cany relevant issue \nrelating to the unpaid tax\u201d at a collection due process \nhearing, and also may raise a challenge to her \u201cunder-\nlying tax liability\u201d when she didn\u2019t have an \nopportunity to do so before. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2). The \nAppeals Office\u2019s \u201cdetermination\u201d must \u201ctake [those is-\nsues] into consideration,\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(3), and the \nTax Court \u201cshall have jurisdiction\u201d to review that de-\ntermination, I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). Nothing in those \nprovisions makes jurisdiction turn on a continuing-\nlevy requirement, much less satisfies the requirement \nthat jurisdictional prerequisites be clearly stated, see \nBoechler, 596 U.S. at 203. The Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction \nunder \u00a7 6330 thus doesn\u2019t vanish when the IRS stops \npursuing a levy. \n\n17 \n \n \n2.  Context confirms that Congress gave the Tax \nCourt continuing jurisdiction under \u00a7 6330 to review \nAppeals Office determinations, including their resolu-\ntion of unpaid tax and tax liability issues. Section \n6330(c)(2)(B) ensures that a taxpayer has a chance to \nchallenge the unpaid tax and her underlying liability \nbefore she must pay or face a levy, and without initi-\nating new litigation against the federal government to \nseek a refund, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(a)(1); I.R.C. \n\u00a7 7422(a).  \n3.  The Tax Court had jurisdiction to review the \nAppeals Office\u2019s determination, including Zuch\u2019s enti-\ntlement to the estimated payments. In proceedings \nbefore the Appeals Office, Zuch challenged the IRS\u2019s \nrefusal to apply the estimated payments to her tax \nbill. The Appeals Office rejected her arguments. Zuch \nthen petitioned the Tax Court for review of the Ap-\npeals Office\u2019s determination\u2014including its resolution \nof the unpaid tax or underlying liability dispute. And \nthe Tax Court had jurisdiction under \u00a7 6330 to review \nthe determination of those issues.  \nB. Zuch\u2019s case wasn\u2019t mooted when the IRS de-\ncided that it no longer needed the levy. A case is moot \nonly if the parties no longer have a concrete interest \nin the outcome, and the court can\u2019t issue any relief \nthat would redress a party\u2019s injury. But here, the Tax \nCourt could issue a ruling deciding whether Zuch is \nentitled to have the $50,000 in estimated payments \napplied to her tax bill. So both parties have an interest \nhere. If Zuch prevails, the IRS is likely to issue a re-\nfund, and if the government prevails, the IRS will \nkeep her money. And win or lose, a judgment from the \nTax Court will be preclusive in the refund suit that \nZuch has now filed in the U.S. District Court for the \nDistrict of New Jersey. \n\n18 \n \n \nII. The government\u2019s counterarguments are un-\npersuasive.  \nA. The government claims that the Tax Court\u2019s \njurisdiction to review a taxpayer\u2019s liability challenge \nrequires a continuing attempt to levy the taxpayer\u2019s \nproperty. That is incorrect\u2014the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdic-\ntion didn\u2019t disappear once the IRS no longer needed \nthe levy. \n1. There is no textual basis for the government\u2019s \ncontinuing-levy requirement. To be sure, \u00a7 6330 men-\ntions the word \u201clevy\u201d\u2014after all, a taxpayer can initiate \nadministrative collection due process proceedings be-\nfore the Appeals Office only after being notified that \nthe IRS is going to levy her property. See I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(a)(3)(B), (b)(1). But once the Appeals Office is-\nsues a determination, the taxpayer can seek Tax \nCourt review of the determination under \u00a7 6330(d)(1). \nSection 6330(d)(1)\u2019s plain terms impose no continuing-\nlevy requirement, much less a \u201cclearly state[d]\u201d juris-\ndictional requirement, Boechler, 596 U.S. at 203. \nWhat\u2019s more, the presumption favoring judicial re-\nview of agency actions supports reading \u00a7 6330(d)(1) \nto confer jurisdiction even if the government abandons \nits levy efforts. See Guerrero-Lasprilla v. Barr, 589 \nU.S. 221, 229 (2020). In arguing otherwise, what the \nIRS is really saying is that, in its view, the Tax Court \ncannot redress a taxpayer\u2019s pocketbook injury when \nthere is no pending levy. But that\u2019s not the case, ei-\nther, as this case makes plain.  \n2. Section 6330\u2019s history and purpose confirm \nthat the Tax Court retains jurisdiction over an unpaid \ntax or liability challenge even after the IRS says it \ndoesn\u2019t need a levy anymore. Congress crafted \u00a7 6330 \nas remedial legislation in response to the IRS\u2019s \n\n19 \n \n \nabusive collection practices as part of a statutory \nscheme to increase fairness to taxpayers by allowing \nthem to challenge what they owe before they pay or \nhave their property seized. In light of that remedial \npurpose, \u00a7 6330 should be construed to mean what it \nsays\u2014the Tax Court has jurisdiction over the Appeals \nOffice\u2019s \u201cdetermination.\u201d \n3. Royal Canin doesn\u2019t suggest otherwise. The \ngovernment argues that the IRS fundamentally al-\ntered the basis of the suit when it decided not to seek \nthe levy. But the basis of the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction \nis the Appeals Office\u2019s determination, not any levy. \nAnd decisions holding that jurisdiction depends on the \nstate of play at the time the suit is brought show that \neven assuming \u00a7 6330 contains a pending-levy re-\nquirement, that requirement turns on the time of \nfiling and thus is met here: there was a levy pending \nwhen Zuch petitioned the Tax Court. \n4.  Policy can\u2019t salvage the government\u2019s position, \neither. The government claims that, if the Tax Court \nhas jurisdiction to review a taxpayer\u2019s liability in a \n\u00a7 6330 proceeding after the IRS determines it no \nlonger needs the levy, the floodgates will open and \n\u00a7 6330 proceedings will become a forum for all kinds \nof liability challenges. But the taxpayer may raise a \nliability issue in a collection due process proceeding \nonly when she did not have an earlier opportunity to \ndo so. Plus, the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction is tied to the \nissues raised before, and determined by, the Appeals \nOffice in the first place. There\u2019s no risk that the Tax \nCourt will begin exercising free-wheeling jurisdiction \nover \u201cgeneral\u201d liability disputes. What\u2019s more, the \nquestion presented rarely arises, and when it does, it\u2019s \nonly because of \u201cthe IRS\u2019s own recalcitrance.\u201d \nBoechler, 596 U.S. at 207. So even if there were a \n\n20 \n \n \nfloodgates problem, it would be the government\u2019s own \ndoing. \nB. The government claims that the Tax Court \nlacks authority to issue a judgment regarding Zuch\u2019s \nentitlement to the estimated payments. In the govern-\nment\u2019s view, the Tax Court can enjoin only a collection \naction in a \u00a7 6330 proceeding, and can\u2019t issue declara-\ntory relief at all. That argument is meritless. \nSection 6330(d)(1) authorizes the Tax Court to deter-\nmine the taxpayer\u2019s unpaid tax and underlying \nliability, and issue a judgment about those issues. And \n\u00a7 6330(e)(1), which allows injunctions \u201cin respect of \nthe unpaid tax or proposed levy,\u201d confirms that the \nTax Court can issue declaratory relief determining a \ntaxpayer\u2019s rights in a challenge involving her liability \nor unpaid tax. The DJA doesn\u2019t provide otherwise, be-\ncause \u00a7 6330(e)(1) exempts \u00a7 6330 from the DJA\u2019s \nprohibition on declaratory relief in most tax cases.  \nC. The government\u2019s other mootness arguments \nfail, too. The government contends that the case is \nmoot because, once the IRS decides not to pursue a \nlevy, \u201cthe issue that prompted the Section 6330 pro-\nceeding is no longer \u2018live.\u2019\u201d Br. 21. But the mootness \ninquiry asks whether the parties retain any interest \nin the outcome of the litigation, and thus whether the \ncourt can redress the plaintiff\u2019s injury. The parties \nhave a concrete interest here, because the Tax Court \ncan decide whether Zuch or the IRS is entitled to the \nmoney.  \nD. Finally, the government mentions in a foot-\nnote that Zuch\u2019s challenge relates to her unpaid tax, \nrather than her underlying liability. But the govern-\nment concedes (Br. 25 n.3) that the dispute is \n\n21 \n \n \nimmaterial. Indeed, as Zuch has explained, the Tax \nCourt had, and retained, jurisdiction either way. \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe Tax Court had jurisdiction under I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330 to review and rule on Zuch\u2019s unpaid \ntax or tax liability, so the case isn\u2019t moot. \nA. The Tax Court had jurisdiction to review \nthe Appeals Office\u2019s determination of \nZuch\u2019s entitlement to the estimated \npayments. \nSection 6330\u2019s text and context make clear that \nthe Tax Court had jurisdiction to review Zuch\u2019s chal-\nlenge to her unpaid tax or underlying tax liability, \neven after the IRS stopped pursuing the levy. \n1. Section 6330\u2019s plain text states that \nthe Tax Court has jurisdiction to \nreview \nthe \nAppeals \nOffice\u2019s \n\u201cdetermination\u201d \nof \na \ntaxpayer\u2019s \nchallenge to \u201cany relevant issue \nrelating to [her] unpaid tax\u201d or her \n\u201cunderlying liability.\u201d  \na. During the collection due process hearing, the \nAppeals Office can determine \u201cany relevant issue re-\nlating to the unpaid tax,\u201d and, if the taxpayer \u201cdid not \nreceive any statutory notice of deficiency \u2026 or did not \notherwise have an opportunity to dispute\u201d it, the tax-\npayer may also challenge \u201cthe existence or amount of \nthe underlying tax liability.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2). A tax-\npayer challenges her underlying tax liability by \ndisputing \u201cthe amounts that the Commissioner as-\nsessed for a particular tax period.\u201d Jeffers v. \nCommissioner, 992 F.3d 649, 653 n.4 (7th Cir. 2021); \naccord Montgomery, 122 T.C. at 7-8. For example, the \n\n22 \n \n \ntaxpayer challenges her underlying tax liability when \nshe claims that the IRS misapplied a credit, if properly \napplying the credit \u201cwould eliminate the outstanding \ntax liability.\u201d Peoplease, LLC v. Commissioner, \nNo. 2161-24L, 2025 WL 429626, at *2 (T.C. Feb. 6, \n2025). Similarly, when a taxpayer raises challenges \nrelating to the unpaid portion of the underlying tax \nliability, she raises an issue related to the unpaid tax. \nSee Internal Revenue Service Chief Counsel Notice \nCC-2014-002 at 3 (May 5, 2014) (\u201c\u2018Unpaid tax\u2019 refers \nto that part of the underlying tax liability not paid by \nthe taxpayer.\u201d).  \nOnce the Appeals Office issues a determination, \nthe taxpayer may \u201cpetition the Tax Court for review \nof [the Appeals Office\u2019s] determination,\u201d \u201cand the Tax \nCourt shall have jurisdiction with respect to such mat-\nter.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). That means the Tax Court \nreviews the \u201cdetermination\u201d of all \u201cthe issues\u201d raised \nduring the hearing. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2), (c)(3)(B). So \nwhen the Tax Court reviews the Appeals Office\u2019s de-\ntermination, it can resolve any dispute about any \nissue relating to the unpaid tax or the taxpayer\u2019s un-\nderlying tax liability that the taxpayer properly raised \nbefore the Appeals Office. See id. \nb. The Tax Court doesn\u2019t lose its jurisdiction to \nresolve a challenge to the Appeals Office determina-\ntion just because the IRS decides to stop pursuing the \nlevy. Congress provided that the Tax Court \u201cshall \nhave jurisdiction\u201d to review the Appeals Office\u2019s deter-\nmination. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1) (emphasis added). That \nreview necessarily reaches all live \u201cissues\u201d involved in \nthe Appeal\u2019s Office\u2019s determination. And those issues \nexpressly include, as relevant here, \u201cany relevant is-\nsue relating to the unpaid tax\u201d and any \u201cchallenges to \nthe existence or amount of the underlying tax \n\n23 \n \n \nliability,\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2), (c)(3)(B). So long as an \nunpaid tax or liability issue remains disputed, nothing \nin \u00a7 6330 suggests the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to re-\nview the question vanishes when the IRS collects the \namount due another way and no longer needs the levy. \nAt most, whether there is a pending levy could affect \nwhat kind of relief the Tax Court can grant. But it \ndoesn\u2019t present any question about jurisdiction under \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1). As explained below (at 28-29), the Tax \nCourt can rule on a taxpayer\u2019s unpaid tax or underly-\ning liability when there are live disputes about those \nissues. \nc. Section 6330\u2019s history confirms that Congress \ndeliberately vested the Tax Court with jurisdiction to \nresolve disputes over a taxpayer\u2019s underlying liability \nand wanted the Tax Court to retain that jurisdiction. \nBefore 2006, \u00a7 6330 provided that taxpayers could \nseek review of the Appeals Office\u2019s determination in \nfederal district court \u201cif the Tax Court [did] not have \njurisdiction of the underlying tax liability.\u201d I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1) (2000). Practically, that language meant \nthat the Tax Court had jurisdiction to review the Ap-\npeals Office\u2019s determination of a liability dispute only \nif the dispute concerned income, estate, or gift taxes, \nbecause the Tax Court already had jurisdiction to re-\nview those kinds of disputes in deficiency proceedings. \nMoore v. Commissioner, 114 T.C. 171, 175 (2000). But \nCongress changed that in 2006 and made clear that \nthe Tax Court \u201cshall\u201d review the taxpayer\u2019s disputed \nliability in all cases. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). Thus, Con-\ngress ensured that \u201cthe Tax Court [has] jurisdiction \nover issues arising from a collection due process hear-\ning\u201d by \u201cconsolidat[ing] all judicial review of \u2026 \ncollection due process determinations,\u201d including a \ntaxpayer\u2019s underlying tax liability, in the Tax Court. \n\n24 \n \n \nStaff of J. Comm. on Taxation, 109th Cong., Descrip-\ntion of the Revenue Provisions Contained in the \nPresident\u2019s Fiscal Year 2007 Budget Proposal 230-31 \n(Comm. Print 2006); accord Staff of J. Comm. On Tax-\nation, 109th Cong., Technical Explanation of H.R. 4, \nThe \u201cPension Protection Act of 2006,\u201d as Passed By the \nHouse on July 28, 2006, and as Considered by the Sen-\nate on August 3, 2006 (Comm. Print. 2006). \n2. Statutory \ncontext \nconfirms \nthat \nCongress \ngave \nthe \nTax \nCourt \ncontinuing jurisdiction to resolve \nissues relating to the unpaid tax and \ntax liability disputes. \nStatutory context shows why Congress likely gave \nthe Tax Court authority to review the issues underly-\ning the Appeals Office\u2019s determination. \nAs noted (at 6-7), in some circumstances, the IRS \nissues a notice of deficiency to a taxpayer, who can \nthen challenge her assessed liability in Tax Court be-\nfore the IRS collects. See I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6212(a), 6512(a). \nBut sometimes the taxpayer doesn\u2019t receive a notice of \ndeficiency or have another opportunity to dispute the \nliability before the IRS seeks to levy the taxpayer\u2019s \nproperty, as in Zuch\u2019s case. See I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B). \nTo ensure that taxpayers have that opportunity, Con-\ngress gave taxpayers the right to dispute their \nliability. Id. Similarly, Congress gave taxpayers the \nright to raise \u201cany relevant issue relating to the un-\npaid tax,\u201d no matter whether they received a notice of \ndeficiency or otherwise had the opportunity to chal-\nlenge the liability. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A). And \nCongress directed the Appeals Office and Tax Court to \nresolve those challenges. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(3), (d)(1). \n\n25 \n \n \nEven if the IRS is able to terminate the levy after \nthe taxpayer initiates \u00a7 6330 proceedings, it makes \nsense for the Tax Court to finish resolving the unpaid \ntax or underlying liability dispute if it remains live. \nAfter all, if the dispute continues past the levy, closing \nthe Tax Court\u2019s doors would simply require the tax-\npayer to file another lawsuit, this time seeking a \nrefund under I.R.C. \u00a7 7422 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(a)(1). \nAnd that would undermine the \u201cdesign[]\u201d of the Tax \nCode \u201cto insure an orderly administration of the reve-\nnue.\u2019\u201d United States v. Clintwood Elkhorn Mining Co., \n553 U.S. 1, 11 (2008). It also would contravene the \ngovernment\u2019s fundamental obligation to \u201cturn square \ncorners in dealing with the people,\u201d Regents of the Uni-\nversity of California, 591 U.S. at 24, by pulling the rug \nout from under a taxpayer who has been litigating \nagainst the IRS for years and forcing her to start new \nlitigation in a different forum.  \nCongress passed \u00a7 6330 to avoid heavy-handed \nIRS tactics, not authorize them in the form of jurisdic-\ntional gamesmanship. And in what is known as the \nTaxpayer Bill of Rights, Congress has also instructed \nthe IRS to \u201censure that employees of the Internal Rev-\nenue Service are familiar with and act in accord with \ntaxpayer rights as afforded by other provisions of this \ntitle.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 7803(a)(3); see Taxpayer Bill of Rights, \nIRS, https://www.irs.gov/taxpayer-bill-of-rights (last \nvisited March 17, 2025). Those rights include \u201cthe \nright to pay no more than the correct amount of tax\u201d; \n\u201cthe right to challenge the position of the Internal \nRevenue Service and be heard\u201d; \u201cthe right to appeal a \ndecision of the Internal Revenue Service in an inde-\npendent forum\u201d; and \u201cthe right to finality.\u201d I.R.C. \n\u00a7 7803(a)(3)(C)-(F). Those rights underscore that the \nTax Court\u2019s jurisdiction under \u00a7 6330 does not vanish \n\n26 \n \n \njust because the IRS seeks to cut off the taxpayer\u2019s \nrights to challenge the agency\u2019s position. By the same \ntoken, nothing in I.R.C. \u00a7 6402, which governs offsets, \npurports to limit the Tax Court\u2019s authority to deter-\nmine the taxpayer\u2019s unpaid tax or liability under \n\u00a7 6330, and reading the provisions that way would in-\nsert words into the statute and contravene the \nTaxpayer Bill of Rights.  \n3. The Tax Court had jurisdiction under \n\u00a7 6330 to review the Appeals Office\u2019s \ndetermination, \nincluding \nits \nresolution of Zuch\u2019s entitlement to \nthe estimated payments. \nThe Tax Court had jurisdiction under \u00a7 6330 to re-\nview the Appeals Office\u2019s determination that Zuch \nwas not entitled to the estimated payments. \nZuch challenged the IRS\u2019s allocation of the esti-\nmated tax payments in the collection due process \nproceedings. In particular, she claimed that she did \nnot owe the IRS the $27,682 for the 2010 tax year be-\ncause the estimated payments should have been \ncredited to her. Pet. App. 9a; see Jeffers, 992 F.3d at \n653 n.4; Peoplease, 2025 WL 429626, at *2. Zuch had \na right to dispute that liability (or unpaid tax, if the \nIRS would prefer to classify it that way). Zuch did not \nreceive a notice of deficiency or otherwise have an op-\nportunity to challenge her claimed liability. Pet. \nApp. 10a. Regardless, Zuch was also entitled to raise \nher challenge as a \u201crelevant issue relating to the un-\npaid tax.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A).  \nAfter the Appeals Office made its determination, \nZuch timely petitioned the Tax Court for review. CA3 \nApp. A24-A30; see CA3 App. A266-270; Pet. App. 41a-\n42a. The Tax Court then had jurisdiction over the \n\n27 \n \n \nAppeals Office\u2019s decision, including the dispute over \nthe estimated payments. See I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2), \n(c)(3)(B), (d)(1). \nTo be sure, while the case was before the Tax \nCourt\u2014and after more than six years of litigation\u2014\nthe IRS announced that it was abandoning the levy. \nBut that didn\u2019t deprive the Tax Court of jurisdiction \nunder \u00a7 6330. Nothing in \u00a7 6330 purports to condition \nthe Tax Court\u2019s ongoing jurisdiction on the IRS\u2019s con-\ntinued pursuit of a levy. \nB. Zuch\u2019s case did not become moot when \nthe IRS decided to stop pursuing the \nlevy, because the parties disputed, and \nthe \nTax \nCourt \nhad \nthe \npower \nto \nadjudicate, Zuch\u2019s entitlement to the \nestimated payments. \nZuch\u2019s case isn\u2019t moot just because the IRS de-\ncided it no longer needed a levy. Mootness comes into \nplay only when the parties no longer have a concrete \ninterest in the outcome. But both Zuch and the IRS \nhave a concrete interest here because the Tax Court \ncan still decide Zuch\u2019s challenge to the Appeals Of-\nfice\u2019s \nunderlying \nliability \nor \nunpaid \ntax \ndeterminations and then rule that Zuch is entitled to \nthe estimated payments. If the Tax Court so rules, the \nIRS is likely to abide by that ruling and issue a refund. \nBut even if the IRS doesn\u2019t issue a refund, the Tax \nCourt\u2019s judgment would be preclusive in the refund \naction Zuch has brought in the District of New Jersey.  \n\n28 \n \n \n1. A case becomes moot only when the \nparties no longer have a concrete \ninterest \nin \nthe outcome \nof the \nlitigation and judicial relief is not \nlikely to redress any injury.  \nThe mootness inquiry asks whether standing \u201cex-\nists throughout the proceedings.\u201d Uzuegbunam v. \nPreczewski, 592 U.S. 279, 282 (2021). The \u201cirreducible \nconstitutional minimum of standing contains three el-\nements\u201d: \n(1) injury \nin \nfact, \n(2) causation \n(i.e., \ntraceability), and (3) redressability. Lujan v. Defend-\ners of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992). \u201cAs long \nas the parties have a concrete interest, however small, \nin the outcome of the litigation, the case is not moot.\u201d \nCampbell-Ewald Co. v. Gomez, 577 U.S. 153, 161 \n(2016). Thus, redressability requires only that judicial \nrelief \u201clikely\u201d will redress an injury, Federal Election \nCommission v. Cruz, 596 U.S. 289, 296 (2022), not \nthat \u201ca favorable decision will relieve\u201d \u201cevery injury,\u201d \nLarson v. Valente, 456 U.S. 228, 243-44 & n.15 (1982) \n(first emphasis added).  \n2. Zuch\u2019s challenge isn\u2019t moot because a \nfavorable \nTax \nCourt \nruling \non \nunderlying liability or unpaid tax \nwould likely redress her pocketbook \ninjury. \nZuch satisfies all three requirements of standing. \nShe suffered a concrete injury when the IRS applied \nthe $50,000 in estimated payments to her ex-hus-\nband\u2019s balance, rather than her own. See, e.g., \nTransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413, 425 \n(2021). If the IRS had applied the estimated payments \nto Zuch\u2019s account\u2014as both she and her ex-husband \nhad \nrequested\u2014Zuch \nwould \nhave \ngotten \nher \n\n29 \n \n \noverpayments back in later years. But, having refused \nto apply the estimated payments to Zuch\u2019s tax bill, the \nIRS kept her overpayments instead. Zuch\u2019s monetary \ninjury is thus traceable to the IRS\u2019s refusal to apply \nthe $50,000 in estimated payments to her 2010 tax \nbill. See Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Or-\nganization, 426 U.S. 26, 41-42 (1976). And the Tax \nCourt can redress Zuch\u2019s injury by ruling that the Ap-\npeals Office was wrong about her liability or unpaid \ntax and thus determining that Zuch is entitled to the \n$50,000 in estimated payments. \nAs noted, the Appeals Office\u2019s \u201cdetermination\u201d \n\u201cshall take into consideration\u201d \u201cthe issues raised\u201d at \nthe hearing, I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(3)(B), including \u201cany rel-\nevant issue relating to the unpaid tax\u201d and \u201cthe \nexistence or amount of the underlying tax liability,\u201d \nI.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2). And because the Tax Court \u201cshall \nhave jurisdiction\u201d to review \u201csuch determination,\u201d \nI.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1), the Tax Court can decide a tax-\npayer\u2019s unpaid tax or underlying tax liability, too. \nAccord Michael I. Saltzman & Leslie Book, IRS Prac-\ntice & Procedure \u00a7 14B.16[4][a] (updated Oct. 2024). \nIn Zuch\u2019s case, that means the Tax Court can rule on \nwhether she is entitled to credit for the estimated pay-\nments, underscoring both parties\u2019 concrete interest in \nthe outcome of the case. See Pet. App. 33a-34a, 42a. \nIf the Tax Court rules that Zuch is entitled to the \nestimated payments, the IRS is likely to issue Zuch a \nrefund. That\u2019s because \u201cit is substantially likely that \n[the IRS] would abide by\u201d that \u201cauthoritative\u201d holding \n\u201cby the [Tax] Court.\u201d Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 \nU.S. 788, 803 (1992); accord Reed v. Goertz, 598 U.S. \n230, 234 (2023); Pet. App. 38a. Indeed, it would be \nquite remarkable for the IRS to simply ignore the Tax \nCourt and decide not to return to Zuch the money that \n\n30 \n \n \na court has determined the IRS has no legal right to \nkeep. That is especially true because the Tax Court \nnot only has authority to review and rule on the un-\nderlying \nliability \nand \nunpaid \ntax \nissues \nin \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1), but it also has authority to put those rul-\nings into a declaratory judgment under \u00a7 6330(e), as \nexplained below (at 40-42). The consequence is that \nthe Tax Court will have \u201c\u2018ordered a change in a legal \nstatus,\u2019 and \u2018the practical consequence of that change \nwould amount to a significant increase in the likeli-\nhood\u2019\u201d that the IRS will give Zuch her money back. \nReed, 598 U.S. at 234. The Tax Court\u2019s authority to \nissue a \u201cdefinitive determination of the legal rights of \nthe parties,\u201d Medtronic, Inc. v. Mirowski Family Ven-\ntures, LLC, 571 U.S. 191, 200 (2014); see Haaland v. \nBrackeen, 599 U.S. 255, 293 (2023), leaves no doubt \nthat the court has the power to grant effective relief. \nEven if the IRS doesn\u2019t issue Zuch a refund, Zuch \nhas filed a refund suit in the District of New Jersey \nunder I.R.C. \u00a7 7422, and the Tax Court\u2019s ruling would \nhave preclusive effect in that suit. \u201cUnder the doctrine \nof issue preclusion, \u2018a prior judgment forecloses suc-\ncessive litigation of an issue of fact or law actually \nlitigated and resolved in a valid court determination \nessential to the prior judgment.\u2019\u201d Herrera v. Wyoming, \n587 U.S. 329, 342 (2019) (alterations adopted). \u201cThe \nidea is straightforward: Once a court has decided an \nissue, it is \u2018forever settled as between the parties.\u2019\u201d \nB&B Hardware, Inc. v. Hargis Industries, Inc., 575 \nU.S. 138, 147 (2015). That goes for declaratory relief \nissued in an earlier case, too. E.g., 18 Charles A. \nWright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Pro-\ncedure \u00a7 4421 (3d ed. updated June 2024). And the \ndoctrine applies \u201ceven if the issue recurs in the context \n\n31 \n \n \nof a different claim.\u201d Taylor v. Sturgell, 553 U.S. 880, \n892 (2008). \nHere, Zuch\u2019s entitlement to the estimated pay-\nments is an \u201cissue of \u2026 law\u201d that would be \u201cactually \nlitigated and resolved\u201d in the Tax Court proceeding \nand \u201cessential to\u201d the Tax Court\u2019s decision on Zuch\u2019s \nunpaid tax or underlying liability. Herrera, 587 U.S. \nat 342. Thus, the Tax Court\u2019s judgment would be pre-\nclusive in the refund suit Zuch has recently filed in the \nDistrict of New Jersey, and that court likely would or-\nder the government to issue a refund. See, e.g., \nParklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 U.S. 322, 325, 332-\n33 (1979). \nII. The IRS\u2019s counterarguments lack merit. \nA. The Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to review \nwhether Zuch was entitled to the \nprepayments didn\u2019t dissolve once the \nIRS no longer needed the levy. \nThe government claims (Br. 16-21), that the Tax \nCourt has jurisdiction under \u00a7 6330 to review a tax-\npayer\u2019s liability only if the IRS continues threatening \nto levy the taxpayer\u2019s property. In the government\u2019s \nview, \u00a7 6330\u2019s text, history, and \u201cfunction\u201d show that \n\u00a7 6330 focuses only on whether a levy can proceed, and \nthe Tax Court thus lacks jurisdiction when the IRS \ndecides it no longer needs a levy. The government also \nwarns that allowing the Tax Court to review live dis-\nputes about unpaid tax or taxpayer liability when no \nlevy is pending would vastly expand Tax Court juris-\ndiction. Those arguments fail. Section 6330\u2019s text, \nhistory, and remedial purpose, plus time-of-filing \nrules in other contexts, all confirm that the Tax Court \nretains jurisdiction under \u00a7 6330 to review a tax-\npayer\u2019s unpaid tax or underlying liability, even when \n\n32 \n \n \nthe IRS abandons its levy. And the government\u2019s pol-\nicy concern is meritless. \n1. There is no textual basis in \u00a7 6330 for \nthe \ngovernment\u2019s \ncontinuing-levy \nrequirement. \na. The government contends that without a \nthreatened levy, there is nothing for the \u201cunderlying \ntax liability\u201d to \u201cunderlie.\u201d Br. 26. So by implication, \nthe government claims, \u00a7 6330 jurisdiction turns on a \nthreatened levy. Br. 24-27. That argument fails. \nSection 6330(d)(1) makes clear that the Tax Court \nhas jurisdiction in \u00a7 6330 proceedings to review the \nAppeals Office\u2019s determination of the issues raised in \na collection due process hearing. Supra pp. 21-23. It \nsays that \u201cthe Tax Court shall have jurisdiction\u201d to re-\nview the Appeals Office\u2019s \u201cdetermination\u201d\u2014which \nincludes all the issues the Appeals Office was required \nto consider during the hearing, not just whether the \nlevy can proceed. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1); see I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(c)(2), (c)(3)(B). The \u201cunderlying liability\u201d lan-\nguage appears in the provisions of \u00a7 6330 listing the \nmatters a taxpayer may raise at the collection due pro-\ncess hearing. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B). The Appeals \nOffice\u2019s determination thus triggers the Tax Court\u2019s \njurisdiction under \u00a7 6330, and the IRS\u2019s actions after \nthe Appeals Office issues the determination have no \nbearing on that jurisdiction. \nWhat\u2019s more, even assuming the phrase \u201cunderly-\ning tax liability\u201d implies that there must be a proposed \nlevy at the outset of the collection due process hearing \n(and there was here), nothing in \u00a7 6330 conditions the \nTax Court\u2019s exercise of \u00a7 6330 jurisdiction on the IRS\u2019s \ncontinued pursuit of a levy. To the contrary, \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1) refers to the Tax Court\u2019s review of a \n\n33 \n \n \n\u201cdetermination\u201d by the Appeals Office. And even if \n\u00a7 6330 required a pending levy at the outset of Tax \nCourt proceedings, that requirement would be satis-\nfied because there was a threatened levy pending \nwhen Zuch petitioned the Tax Court. Infra pp. 38-39. \nThat makes sense. Zuch continues to be aggrieved by \nthe Appeals Office\u2019s determination upholding the \nIRS\u2019s liability assessment, even though the IRS claims \nit no longer needs the levy. \nViewing Zuch\u2019s challenge as one \u201crelating to the \nunpaid tax\u201d doesn\u2019t mean the Tax Court lost jurisdic-\ntion to review the dispute, either. That\u2019s because the \n$27,682 the IRS claims Zuch owed for the 2010 tax \nyear was \u201cunpaid\u201d when she petitioned the Tax Court \nin 2014. See Pet. App. 11a. \nb. The government also claims that the text of \n\u00a7 6330 is \u201cnarrowly focused\u201d on \u201cwhether the IRS may \ngo forward with its proposed levy,\u201d from the title for \nthe section to the provisions describing the beginning \nof collection due process proceedings and granting the \nTax Court jurisdiction. Br. 17; see Br. 17-20. Not so. \nFor starters, the title of a provision is \u201cnot meant \nto take the place of the detailed provisions of the text\u201d; \nnor is it \u201cnecessarily designed to be a reference guide \nor a synopsis.\u201d Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. \nBaltimore & Ohio Railroad Co., 331 U.S. 519, 528 \n(1947). What\u2019s more, even though a taxpayer can ini-\ntiate collection due process proceedings with the \nAppeals Office when the IRS seeks to levy, see I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(a)(1), the provisions that authorize the Tax \nCourt to review a taxpayer\u2019s liability challenge\u2014\n\u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B) and (d)(1)\u2014do not \u201cfocus[] on\u201d a levy. \nSection 6330(c)(2)(B), for instance, allows taxpayers in \nsome situations to \u201craise at the hearing challenges to \n\n34 \n \n \nthe existence or amount of the underlying tax liabil-\nity.\u201d And \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A) differentiates \u201crelevant \nissue[s] relating to the unpaid tax\u201d from issues about \n\u201cthe proposed levy.\u201d Section 6330(d)(1), moreover, \nstates that the taxpayer may \u201cpetition the Tax Court \nfor review of such determination (and the Tax Court \nshall have jurisdiction with respect to such matter).\u201d \nNo continuing-levy requirement there. \nc. Next, the government says that \u00a7 6330(d)(1)\u2019s \nreference to the Appeals Office\u2019s \u201cdetermination\u201d im-\nplies that Tax Court jurisdiction hinges on a \nthreatened levy because the \u201cdetermination\u201d is about \nonly \u201cwhether the levy may go forward.\u201d Br. 19-20. \nThat\u2019s wrong, too. Section 6330(d)(1) authorizes the \nTax Court to review that \u201cdetermination,\u201d which nec-\nessarily involves reviewing the Appeals Office\u2019s \nresolution of each issue raised at the collection due \nprocess hearing. Supra pp. 21-23. That includes, \nwhere relevant, the taxpayer\u2019s unpaid tax or underly-\ning liability, see I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2), (c)(3)(B)\u2014\ndeterminations, as this very case shows, with signifi-\ncance beyond whether a levy may proceed. Those \nrulings determine who keeps the money both parties \nclaim is legally theirs. And as the government admits \n(Br. 19-20), the Tax Court\u2019s resolution of those issues \nis part and parcel of the determination. Nothing in \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1) conditions the Tax Court\u2019s review of that \ndetermination\u2014and all the issues it resolves\u2014on a \ncontinuing levy. \nd. The government\u2019s atextual continuing-levy re-\nquirement fails for another reason: \u201cthe presumption \nfavoring judicial review of administrative action,\u201d \nGuerrero-Lasprilla, 589 U.S. at 229, weighs in favor of \nTax Court jurisdiction. The \u201cstrong presumption\u201d of \njudicial review directs that \u201cwhen a statutory \n\n35 \n \n \nprovision \u2018is reasonably susceptible to divergent inter-\npretation,\u2019\u201d courts must \u201cadopt the reading that \naccords with traditional understandings and basic \nprinciples: that executive determinations generally \nare subject to judicial review.\u201d Id. And where applica-\nble, the \u201cpresumption can only be overcome by \u2018clear \nand convincing evidence\u2019 of congressional intent to \npreclude judicial review.\u201d Id. Those principles also \nalign with this Court\u2019s recent recognition in the \u00a7 6330 \ncontext that jurisdictional requirements must be \n\u201cclearly state[d].\u201d Boechler, 596 U.S. at 203. \nHere, \u00a7 6330 is susceptible to one interpretation: \nthe Tax Court retains jurisdiction to review a deter-\nmination even if the IRS says it no longer needs the \nlevy. Supra pp. 21-26. Section 6330(d)(1) doesn\u2019t men-\ntion levies, much less contain a clear continuing-levy \nrequirement. But even if another reasonable interpre-\ntation were possible, it is far from clear that Congress \nintended to insulate the Appeals Office\u2019s unpaid tax \nand liability determinations when the IRS stops pur-\nsuing a levy. See Pet. Br. 34. \nThe presumption doesn\u2019t become irrelevant here \njust because Zuch can file a refund suit and obtain ju-\ndicial review of her entitlement to the estimated \npayments that way, as the government contends (id.). \nThe \u201cadministrative action\u201d at issue here is the Ap-\npeals Office\u2019s determination. Guerrero-Lasprilla, 589 \nU.S. at 229. So the question is whether that determi-\nnation is reviewable in the Tax Court under \u00a7 6330\u2014\nnot whether Zuch may obtain review of another ac-\ntion, in a different court, and under a different Code \nprovision. The presumption applies in answering the \nformer question. And the answer is that the Tax Court \nretains jurisdiction. \n\n36 \n \n \n2. The \ngovernment \nmisconstrues \n\u00a7 6330\u2019s history and downplays its \nremedial \npurpose, \nwhich \nboth \nsupport \nthe \nTax \nCourt\u2019s \n\u00a7 6330 \njurisdiction to review unpaid tax and \nliability disputes even if the IRS no \nlonger pursues the levy. \nThe government claims (Br. 22-23) that because \nCongress added \u00a7 6330 in 1998 to allow taxpayers to \nchallenge levies before the IRS seized their property, \nthat somehow shows that the Tax Court has jurisdic-\ntion only if a levy is pending. But that argument \ncannot trump plain text. And in any event, \u00a7 6330\u2019s \nhistory and purpose confirm that Congress wanted \nthe Tax Court to retain jurisdiction over a live unpaid \ntax or liability dispute even if the IRS no longer needs \na levy. \nCongress enacted \u00a7 6330 to protect taxpayers from \nthe IRS\u2019s abusive collection practices and to rein in the \nIRS\u2019s unchecked power to act as \u201cjudge, jury, and exe-\ncutioner, answerable to none.\u201d Hearings Before the \nCommittee on Finance at 56, 82; see supra pp. 9-10. \nAnd in designing \u00a7 6330\u2019s scheme, Congress sought to \n\u201censure that all taxpayers have due process and that \nthe IRS does not abusively use its liens-and-seizure \nauthority.\u201d 143 Cong. Rec. S12231 (statement of Sen. \nRoth). Indeed, the point of \u00a7 6330 proceedings is to \u201cin-\ncrease fairness to taxpayers\u201d before the IRS deprives \nthem of their property. S. Rep. No. 105-174, at 67; ac-\ncord Katz v. Commissioner, 115 T.C. 329, 333 n.8 \n(2000) (explaining that Congress enacted \u00a7 6330 \u201cto \nprovide new protections for taxpayers\u201d). \nSection 6330 did just that. It gave taxpayers a \nchance to challenge their liability before paying it \n\n37 \n \n \nwhen the taxpayer did not already have an oppor-\ntunity to challenge the liability, and ensured \ntaxpayers may always raise \u201cany relevant issue relat-\ning to the unpaid tax.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2). Section \n6330 thus gave taxpayers an opportunity for IRS Ap-\npeals to reach a \u201cdetermination\u201d on their unpaid tax \nor liability, and granted taxpayers the right \u201cto peti-\ntion the Tax Court to contest the Appeals [Office\u2019s] \ndecision,\u201d 144 Cong. Rec. S4494 (statement of Sen. \nHatch). Put simply, history shows that Congress did \nnot intend to enable the IRS to unilaterally deprive \nthe Tax Court of jurisdiction to review unpaid tax or \nliability disputes by finding another way to take the \ntaxpayer\u2019s money and then claiming it no longer seeks \nthe levy. And given \u00a7 6330\u2019s history, the Court should \nconstrue the statute \u201cbroadly to effectuate its pur-\nposes.\u201d Tcherepnin v. Knight, 389 U.S. 332, 336 (1967); \nsee Piedmont & Northern Railway. v. Interstate Com-\nmerce Commission, 286 U.S. 299, 311 (1932). \n3. Royal \nCanin \ndoesn\u2019t \nhelp \nthe \ngovernment. \nPointing to this Court\u2019s decision in Royal Canin, \nthe government argues that \u00a7 6330 contains a contin-\nuing-levy requirement because the IRS \u201calter[s]\u201d \n\u201c[t]he fundamental basis\u201d of the suit when it decides \nto no longer seek the levy. Br. 29-31. That argument \nfails. \nIn Royal Canin, the Court held that, if a plaintiff \namends her complaint to \u201celiminate[] the federal-law \nclaims that enabled removal, leaving only state-law \nclaims behind, the court\u2019s power to decide the dispute \ndissolves.\u201d 604 U.S. at 30. That makes sense, given the \nbasic idea that \u201c[i]f a plaintiff amends her complaint, \nthe new pleading \u2018supersedes\u2019 the old one.\u201d Id. at 35 \n\n38 \n \n \n(citing 6 Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice \nand Procedure \u00a7 1476 (3d ed. 2010)). And in Royal \nCanin, the plaintiff altered the basis for the federal \ncourt\u2019s federal question jurisdiction by amending her \ncomplaint to withdraw her federal claims.  \nNone of those principles shows that the Tax Court \nlost jurisdiction under \u00a7 6330 to review the Appeals \nOffice\u2019s determination when the IRS stopped pursuing \nthe levy. The basis of the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction un-\nder \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1) \nis \nthe \nAppeals \nOffice\u2019s \ndetermination\u2014not the proposed levy. The IRS did \nnot change the basis of the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction by \ndropping the levy, because once the Appeals Office is-\nsues a \u201cdetermination,\u201d the Tax Court has jurisdiction \nto review it. See I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1) (\u201cthe Tax Court \nshall have jurisdiction\u201d to \u201creview\u201d the \u201cdetermina-\ntion\u201d). And unlike the plaintiff in Royal Canin, Zuch \ndidn\u2019t file an amended pleading changing the basis of \nthe Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction. When Zuch filed her Tax \nCourt petition, she challenged the Appeals Office\u2019s de-\ntermination that she was not entitled to the estimated \npayments. That\u2019s still her challenge today, and the \nIRS\u2019s decision to stop pursuing the levy is irrelevant.  \nBut even assuming the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction \nunder \u00a7 6330 was somehow contingent on a levy, time-\nof-filing rules show that any levy requirement was \nmet because there was a pending levy when Zuch pe-\ntitioned the Tax Court. Time-of-filing rules generally \nprovide that jurisdiction \u201cdepends upon the state of \nthings at the time\u201d the plaintiff brings the action, \nGrupo Dataflux v. Atlas Global Group, L.P., 541 U.S. \n567, 570 (2004); see, e.g., Conolly v. Taylor, 27 U.S. (2 \nPet.) 556, 565 (1829)\u2014here, when the taxpayer peti-\ntions the Tax Court. So, if \u00a7 6330 did require a pending \nlevy, that levy requirement would be assessed at the \n\n39 \n \n \ntime the taxpayer files her Tax Court petition. And \nhere, there was a pending levy when Zuch petitioned \nthe Tax Court. Pet. App. 11a, 13a. The IRS\u2019s decision \nto stop pursuing the levy thus does not destroy the Tax \nCourt\u2019s jurisdiction to review the Appeals Office\u2019s de-\ntermination, even if \u00a7 6330 contains a levy-based \njurisdictional requirement. \n4. The government\u2019s policy argument is \nmeritless. \nThe government claims that, if it cannot deprive \nthe Tax Court of jurisdiction to review a liability chal-\nlenge by no longer seeking the levy, \u00a7 6330 will turn \ninto a \u201cgeneral forum for considering challenges to tax \nliability.\u201d Br. 24. That argument lacks merit. \nThere\u2019s no risk of the Tax Court wading into gen-\neral liability determinations in \u00a7 6330 proceedings. \nSection 6330 specifies the issues taxpayers may raise \nin \ncollection \ndue \nprocess \nhearings. \nI.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A). And only taxpayers who did not have \nan earlier opportunity to challenge their assessed lia-\nbility can challenge that claimed liability in collection \ndue process proceedings. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B). The \nTax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to review the taxpayer\u2019s lia-\nbility (or issue relating to the unpaid tax), in turn, is \ntied to the Appeals Office\u2019s liability determination. \nI.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). The sky isn\u2019t falling, and the gov-\nernment hasn\u2019t pointed to any \u00a7 6330 cases pending \nbefore the Appeals Office or the Tax Court that would \nsuggest otherwise. \nWhat\u2019s more, the question presented in this case \narises rarely, and when it does, it\u2019s only as a result of \n\u201cthe IRS\u2019s own recalcitrance.\u201d Boechler, 596 U.S. at \n207. The question arises only when the IRS initiates a \nlevy, but during \u00a7 6330 proceedings, finds a way to \n\n40 \n \n \ntake the taxpayer\u2019s money another way, and drops the \nlevy during the Tax Court\u2019s review. But there\u2019s no rea-\nson to think the issue comes up with any frequency. \nB. The Tax Court\u2019s authority is not limited \nto approving or rejecting a proposed \nlevy, but includes the power to issue \nbinding judgments. \nThe government argues that the Tax Court \ndoesn\u2019t have the power to declare Zuch\u2019s entitlement \nto the estimated payments. In the government\u2019s view, \n\u00a7 6330 doesn\u2019t authorize that relief, the DJA\u2019s prohi-\nbition on declaratory relief in most tax cases bars \nbinding relief here, and \u00a7 6330 is a \u201climited mecha-\nnism\u201d for either allowing or disallowing a levy. Br. 23-\n24, 27-29. Those arguments are meritless. \nFirst, \u00a7 6330(d)(1) authorizes the Tax Court to de-\ntermine whether the estimated payments should have \ncovered the amount the IRS assessed for the 2010 tax \nyear, no matter whether there is a pending levy. \nThat\u2019s because the Tax Court \u201cshall have jurisdiction\u201d \nto \u201creview\u201d the Appeals Office\u2019s determination of the \ntaxpayer\u2019s underlying liability or issues relating to \nher unpaid tax. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B), (d)(1). And that \nmeans the Tax Court can issue a ruling resolving \nZuch\u2019s liability or issues relating to the unpaid tax. \nThe IRS is expected to abide by that ruling, and in-\ndeed, that ruling will have preclusive effect. Supra \npp. 28-31. \nSecond, \u00a7 6330(e)(1) confirms that the Tax Court \ncan issue its ruling in the form of declaratory relief. \nThat provision authorizes injunctive relief in \u00a7 6330 \nproceedings, which necessarily means it also author-\nizes declaratory relief. That\u2019s because an injunction \nnecessarily rests on a declaration. Indeed, an \n\n41 \n \n \ninjunction prohibiting an act incorporates \u201ca judicial \ndeclaration that [the act] is illegal,\u201d Pet. App. 36a. \nAnd as this Court has recognized, declaratory relief is \na \u201cmilder\u201d alternative to an injunction. Steffel v. \nThompson, 415 U.S. 452, 466-67 (1974). Thus, the Tax \nCourt\u2019s authority to issue an injunction under \n\u00a7 6330(e)(1) includes the authority to issue declara-\ntory relief. \nResisting that conclusion, the government asserts \nthat \u00a7 6330(e)(1) can\u2019t authorize declaratory relief be-\ncause it limits injunctive authority to \u201ca specific \ncollection action.\u201d Br. 28-29. Not so. Section 6330(e)(1) \nauthorizes the Tax Court to enjoin \u201cany action or pro-\nceeding\u201d if: (1) \u201ca timely appeal has been filed under \nsubsection (d)(1),\u201d and (2) the injunction is \u201cin respect \nof the unpaid tax or proposed levy to which the deter-\nmination being appealed relates.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(e)(1); \nsee I.R.C. \u00a7 7421(a). And if the Tax Court can issue an \ninjunction \u201cin respect of the unpaid tax or proposed \nlevy,\u201d it can also decide the taxpayer\u2019s liability that \ngave rise to both the unpaid tax and the proposed levy.  \nThird, the DJA doesn\u2019t withdraw the Tax Court\u2019s \nauthority to issue declaratory relief. That statute au-\nthorizes federal courts to \u201cdeclare the rights and other \nlegal relations of any interested party seeking such \ndeclaration,\u201d \u201cexcept with respect to Federal taxes.\u201d 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2201(a). But courts have uniformly held that \nthe DJA must be read together with the Tax Code and \nthe AIA, I.R.C. \u00a7 7421(a). And that means the DJA \ndoes not prohibit declaratory relief where those other \nprovisions permit injunctions. E.g., Cohen v. United \nStates, 650 F.3d 717, 727-28 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (en banc); \nCIC Services, LLC v. Internal Revenue Service, 925 \nF.3d 247, 250 n.3 (6th Cir. 2019), rev\u2019d on other \ngrounds 593 U.S. 209 (2021); see Bob Jones University \n\n42 \n \n \nv. Simon, 416 U.S. 725, 732 n.7 (1974). Both the plain \ntext of \u00a7 6330(d)(1) and (e)(1) and the AIA, I.R.C. \n\u00a7 7421(a), authorize injunctions in \u00a7 6330 proceed-\nings, so declaratory relief is authorized as well. \nFinally, as explained (at 32-35), \u00a7 6330 isn\u2019t just \nabout whether a levy can proceed or not, so the Tax \nCourt\u2019s authority is not limited to deciding whether or \nnot a levy can proceed, either. Instead, Congress en-\nacted \u00a7 6330 to create a meaningful exception to what \nthe government says is the Tax Code\u2019s historical \u201cpay \nnow, dispute later\u201d framework. See Pet. Br. 2. It did so \nby allowing taxpayers to challenge the unpaid tax and \ntheir liability before they decide to pay or the IRS lev-\nies their property. And as \u00a7 6330\u2019s history confirms, \nthe Tax Court retains jurisdiction under \u00a7 6330 to re-\nview the Appeals Office\u2019s determination of her unpaid \ntax or tax liability, so it can issue binding relief resolv-\ning those issues, too. Supra pp. 23-24, 36-37. \nC. The government\u2019s claim that the parties \nlack a legally cognizable interest in the \ncase once the IRS decides not to move \nforward with the levy is incorrect. \nUnable to show that its actions deprived the Tax \nCourt of \u00a7 6330 jurisdiction, the IRS next contends \n(Br. 21), that the case is moot because once the IRS \ndecides it doesn\u2019t need a levy, the parties lack a legally \ncognizable interest. That is so, the IRS says, because \neven if \u201cthe IRS has made an error or continues to owe \n[the taxpayer] money,\u201d there\u2019s no threatened levy, and \nthe levy is \u201cthe issue that prompted\u201d the collection due \nprocess hearing. Id. That argument fails. \nThe question isn\u2019t whether \u201cthe issue that \nprompted\u201d a collection due process hearing is live. Ra-\nther, \u201c[a]s long as the parties have a concrete interest, \n\n43 \n \n \nhowever small, in the outcome of the litigation,\u201d the \ncase is not moot. Campbell-Ewald Co., 577 U.S. at \n161. And as explained, Zuch has a concrete interest in \nthe outcome of the litigation because the Tax Court \ncan adjudicate her unpaid tax or underlying liability \nby determining her right to the estimated payments, \nand therefore to a refund. Accord Saltzman & Book, \nsupra, \u00a7 14B.16[4][a]. That ruling would also be pre-\nclusive in the refund action Zuch has brought in the \nDistrict of New Jersey under I.R.C. \u00a7 7422. The IRS \nhas a concrete interest, too: if the Tax Court decides \nthat Zuch is not entitled to the estimated payments, \nthe IRS keeps her money. It is thus not \u201cimpossible for \na court to grant any effectual relief what[so]ever\u201d to \nwhomever prevails. Chafin v. Chafin, 568 U.S. 165, \n172 (2013). \nD. Whether Zuch\u2019s challenge is a dispute \nabout an unpaid tax or underlying \nliability is immaterial. \nIn a footnote, the government claims that Zuch\u2019s \nchallenge presents \u201can issue relating to [her] unpaid \ntax,\u201d rather than her tax liability. Br. 25 n.3. But, as \nthe government concedes, whether Zuch\u2019s challenge is \nabout an unpaid tax or underlying liability is immate-\nrial. Id. (\u201cThe Court need not \u2026 decide this dispute to \nresolve the question presented.\u201d). The difference \ndoesn\u2019t matter because, as explained (at 26-27), even \nif Zuch\u2019s challenge is one related to an \u201cunpaid tax,\u201d \nthe Tax Court still had jurisdiction. That\u2019s because \nZuch\u2019s challenge to her unpaid tax would still have \nbeen part of the Appeals Office\u2019s \u201cdetermination\u201d that \nwas reviewable by the Tax Court. Id. \nIn any event, the Appeals Office itself considered \nZuch to be challenging her underlying tax liability. \n\n44 \n \n \nPet. App. 48a, 66a. Indeed, she disputed whether she \nowed \u201cthe amounts that the Commissioner assessed \nfor [the 2010] tax period,\u201d Jeffers, 992 F.3d at 653 n.4, \nbecause she argued the estimated payments should \nhave been applied to her, see Peoplease, 2025 WL \n429626, at *2. Supra p. 26. And, in the IRS\u2019s own view, \n\u201cunpaid tax\u201d is just the unpaid portion of the \u201cunder-\nlying tax liability\u201d anyway.

As the D.C. and Fourth Circuits \nhave held, that special pre-deprivation proceeding be-\ncomes moot when the IRS no longer needs to pursue a \nlevy.  But the Third Circuit in this case openly \u201cpart[ed] \nways\u201d with those circuits, Pet. App. 27a, holding that a \nSection 6330 proceeding may continue even in the ab-\nsence of any pending levy.  Respondent\u2019s attempts to de-\nfend that decision misunderstand the text of the statute \nthat Congress enacted.  And respondent\u2019s denial of the \nexistence of a circuit split contradicts what the decision \nitself acknowledges.  The petition for a writ of certiorari \nshould be granted. \n\n2 \n \nA. Respondent\u2019s Efforts To Defend The Decision Below \nLack Merit \nAs the petition explains (at 8-14), the Section 6330 \nproceeding in this case is moot because there is no longer \na live dispute over the proposed levy that prompted the \nproceeding.  The court of appeals\u2019 contrary decision is \nwrong, Pet. App. 16a-39a, and respondent\u2019s efforts to de-\nfend it lack merit. \n1. Because there is no longer a live dispute over the \nproposed levy in this case, the Section 6330 proceeding \nis moot \nAs an Article I court, \u201c[t]he Tax Court is a court of \nlimited jurisdiction.\u201d  Commissioner v. McCoy, 484 U.S. \n3, 7 (1987) (per curiam); see 26 U.S.C. 7441.  In a Section \n6330 proceeding, the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction is limited \nto reviewing a particular \u201cdetermination\u201d by the IRS \nIndependent Office of Appeals (Appeals Office): a \u201cde-\ntermination\u201d whether the proposed levy may proceed.  26 \nU.S.C. 6330(c)(3) and (d)(1).  When there is no longer a \nlive controversy over the proposed levy, there is no longer \nany need for such a determination, and the Section 6330 \nproceeding is \u201cmoot.\u201d  Willson v. Commissioner, 805 F.3d \n316, 321 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (citation omitted).  That is so \n\u201cnotwithstanding the existence of other live controver-\nsies between the taxpayer and the IRS that do not fall \nwithin the tax court\u2019s jurisdiction\u201d under Section 6330.  \nId. at 320. \nRespondent does not dispute that there is no longer \na live controversy over the proposed levy in this case.  \nIn fact, respondent acknowledges (Br. in Opp. 20) that \n\u201cthe IRS decided to stop pursuing the levy\u201d after it was \nable to use respondent\u2019s overpayments to offset her tax \nliability under 26 U.S.C. 6402(a).  That should be the end \nof the matter.  Because there is no longer any need for \n\n3 \n \na determination whether the proposed levy may go for-\nward, the Section 6330 proceeding in this case is moot. \n2. Respondent\u2019s contrary arguments are unpersuasive \nIn concluding that the Section 6330 proceeding in this \ncase is not moot, the court of appeals held that (a) the \nTax Court still has jurisdiction to consider respondent\u2019s \n\u201cunderlying tax liability,\u201d Pet. App. 26a (citation omit-\nted), and (b) the IRS\u2019s exercise of statutory authority to \noffset respondent\u2019s tax liability was \u201cinvalid,\u201d id. at 25a.  \nRespondent\u2019s arguments in support of the first holding \nlack merit, and respondent does not even attempt to de-\nfend the second holding. \na. The Tax Court lacks jurisdiction to consider \n\u201cthe underlying tax liability\u201d when there is no \nlive dispute over the proposed levy \nRespondent contends (Br. in Opp. 12) that \u201cSection \n6330 authorizes the Tax Court to review the Appeals Of-\nfice\u2019s determination of a taxpayer\u2019s underlying liability \nand to issue declaratory relief accordingly, notwithstand-\ning the IRS\u2019s decision to stop pursuing a levy.\u201d  That is \nincorrect.  The only determination that Section 6330 au-\nthorizes the Tax Court to review is the Appeals Office\u2019s \n\u201cdetermination\u201d whether a proposed levy may proceed.  \n26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3) and (d)(1).  Here, for example, the \n\u201cNotice of Determination\u201d issued by the Appeals Office \nspecifies that the Office \u201chas determined to sustain the \naction (levy).\u201d  Pet. App. 61a, 64a (capitalization altered).  \nAnd the only relief that Section 6330 authorizes upon \nreview of that determination is rejection of the proposed \nlevy.  See Willson, 805 F.3d at 321.1 \n \n1 Section 6330(e)(1) is not to the contrary.  That provision merely \nauthorizes the Tax Court to enjoin \u201cthe beginning of a levy or pro-\nceeding during\u201d the pendency of a Section 6330 proceeding.  26 U.S.C. \n \n\n4 \n \nOf course, in \u201cdetermin[ing]\u201d whether a proposed \nlevy may proceed, the Appeals Office may consider var-\nious subsidiary issues, including \u201cchallenges to the ex-\nistence or amount of the underlying tax liability  * * *   \nif the person did not receive any statutory notice of de-\nficiency for such tax liability or did not otherwise have \nan opportunity to dispute such tax liability.\u201d  26 U.S.C. \n6330(c)(2)(B) and (3).2  But the text of Section 6330 makes \nclear that when there is no longer any live dispute over \nthe proposed levy, there is no longer any jurisdiction to \nconsider challenges about those subsidiary issues.  The \nstatute does not identify them as freestanding issues, \nbut rather as ones that \u201c[t]he determination\u201d about the \nproposed levy \u201cshall take into consideration,\u201d 26 U.S.C. \n6330(c)(3)\u2014confirming that when the \u201cproposed levy is \nmoot,\u201d a taxpayer \u201chas no independent basis\u201d to continue \npursuing those challenges, Greene-Thapedi v. Commis-\n \n6330(e)(1).  Contrary to respondent\u2019s suggestion (Br. in Opp. 23), Sec-\ntion 6330(e)(1) does not authorize the Tax Court to \u201cdeclare [a tax-\npayer\u2019s] liability\u201d\u2014let alone authorize that court to issue any relief \nin the absence of a pending levy. \n2 Like the court of appeals, respondent characterizes her challenge \nto the IRS\u2019s allocation of estimated payments in this case as a chal-\nlenge to \u201cthe underlying tax liability.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B); see \nBr. in Opp. 14, 19; Pet. App. 17a-19a.  The government disputes that \ncharacterization; in its view, respondent\u2019s challenge presents an \u201cis-\nsue relating to the unpaid tax,\u201d 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(A), which a tax-\npayer could raise in the course of a live controversy over a proposed \nlevy even if the taxpayer had previously received a \u201cstatutory notice \nof deficiency,\u201d 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B).  See Gov\u2019t C.A. Supp. Br. 24-\n25.  This dispute over the characterization of respondent\u2019s challenge, \nhowever, has no bearing on the correct answer to the question pre-\nsented.  Even under respondent\u2019s characterization of her challenge, \nthe Section 6330 proceeding in this case is moot because a taxpayer \nmay challenge \u201cthe underlying tax liability\u201d only in connection with \na determination about a proposed levy.  See Pet. 10-11. \n\n5 \n \nsioner, 126 T.C. 1, 8 (2006).  And Congress\u2019s use of the \nphrase \u201cunderlying tax liability\u201d reinforces the infer-\nence that jurisdiction exists only in connection with a \npre-deprivation determination about a proposed levy.  \n26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B) (emphasis added); see Pet. 11.  \nRespondent therefore errs in asserting (Br. in Opp. 18) \nthat \u201c[n]othing in \u00a7 6330 purports to condition the Tax \nCourt\u2019s ongoing jurisdiction on the IRS\u2019s continued pur-\nsuit of a levy.\u201d \nContrary to respondent\u2019s contention (Br. in Opp. 15-\n16), the statutory history and context undermine, rather \nthan support, her interpretation of Section 6330.  Con-\ngress enacted Section 6330 on the view that \u201c[d]ue pro-\ncess\u201d warrants giving taxpayers notice and an oppor-\ntunity to be heard before the IRS engages in a particu-\nlar type of collection action: a levy on a taxpayer\u2019s prop-\nerty.  Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Re-\nform Act of 1998, Pub. L. No. 105-206, Tit. III, \u00a7 3401(b), \n112 Stat. 747.  When the IRS decides that it no longer \nneeds to levy on the taxpayer\u2019s property, that rationale \nfor a pre-deprivation proceeding no longer applies. \nCongress\u2019s 2006 amendment to Section 6330 does not \nsuggest otherwise.  Section 6330(d)(1) originally granted \nboth the Tax Court and district courts jurisdiction to re-\nview the Appeals Office\u2019s determinations, depending on \nthe type of tax at issue.  26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1) (Supp. IV \n1998).  The 2006 amendment simply revised Section \n6330(d)(1) to make the Tax Court the sole court with ju-\nrisdiction to review those determinations.  Pension Pro-\ntection Act of 2006, Pub. L. No. 109-280, \u00a7 855(a), 120 \nStat. 1019.  Nothing about that amendment suggests that \na Section 6330 proceeding may continue without any \nlive dispute over a proposed levy. \n\n6 \n \nRespondent attempts to analogize Section 6330 to \nfederal statutes that make \u201cjurisdiction \u2018depend upon \nthe state of things at the time of the action brought.\u2019\u200a\u201d  \nBr. in Opp. 16 (brackets and citation omitted).  But those \nanalogies fail because Section 6330 limits the Tax Court\u2019s \njurisdiction to review of a particular kind of \u201cdetermi-\nnation\u201d: a \u201cdetermination\u201d whether the proposed levy \nmay proceed.  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3) and (d)(1).  When there \nis no longer any need for such a determination, the Sec-\ntion 6330 proceeding is moot. \nFinally, respondent invokes \u201cthe presumption favor-\ning judicial review of administrative action.\u201d  Br. in Opp. \n23 (quoting Guerrero-Lasprilla v. Barr, 589 U.S. 221, \n229 (2020)).  But that presumption is inapplicable here \nbecause the government\u2019s interpretation of Section 6330 \ndoes not eliminate judicial review.  See Pet. 14.  As re-\nspondent acknowledges, taxpayers in her position may \nstill \u201chead to court\u201d by filing a refund suit\u2014the tradi-\ntional mechanism for disputing the assessment or col-\nlection of a federal tax, and the one that is available \nwhether or not there was ever a proposed levy to trigger \nSection 6330.  Br. in Opp. 4; see, e.g., id. at 2 (acknowl-\nedging that \u201ctaxpayers can file refund suits anyway\u201d); \nid. at 13 (acknowledging that \u201cthe taxpayer can sepa-\nrately sue the government for a refund under [26 U.S.C.] \n7422\u201d). \nb. The Tax Court lacks jurisdiction to review offsets \nin a Section 6330 proceeding \nIn concluding that the Section 6330 proceeding in this \ncase is not moot, the court of appeals also held that the \nIRS\u2019s exercise of statutory authority to offset respond-\nent\u2019s tax liability was invalid.  Pet. App. 19a-25a.  Re-\nspondent makes no attempt to defend that holding, see \nBr. in Opp. 3-4, 13, 18-19, and for good reason.  As the pe-\n\n7 \n \ntition explains (at 12-14), no statute grants the Tax Court \njurisdiction to review the IRS\u2019s exercise of statutory  \nauthority to credit a taxpayer\u2019s overpayments against \nher tax liability.  And in any event, even if the Tax Court \nhad such jurisdiction, and even if the offsets were inva-\nlid, there would still be no live controversy over whether \nthe proposed levy may proceed\u2014as would be required \nfor the Tax Court to be able to consider respondent\u2019s  \nchallenge to \u201cthe underlying tax liability.\u201d  26 U.S.C. \n6330(c)(2)(B); see Pet. 10-11, 13.  The court of appeals\u2019 \nattempt to avoid a mootness problem by deeming the \noffsets invalid therefore fails. \nB. Respondent\u2019s Attempts To Minimize The Need For This \nCourt\u2019s Review Are Unavailing \n1. As the petition explains (at 14-16), the Third Cir-\ncuit\u2019s decision in this case conflicts with decisions of the \nD.C. and Fourth Circuits. \na. The Third Circuit itself recognized that its deci-\nsion \u201cpart[s] ways\u201d with the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision in \nWillson v. Commissioner, supra.  Pet. App. 27a.  Re-\nspondent nevertheless denies the existence of a conflict, \nasserting (Br. in Opp. 12) that Willson \u201cheld only that a \n\u00a7 6330 proceeding becomes moot if the IRS decides to \nstop pursuing the levy and no dispute about the tax-\npayer\u2019s liability remains.\u201d  But that is not what Willson \nheld.  Rather, as the decision below acknowledged, Will-\nson held that \u201cthere is \u2018no appropriate course of action \nfor the Tax Court to take but to dismiss a case as moot\u2019 \nwhen the IRS withdraws its proposed levy.\u201d  Pet. App. \n27a (quoting Willson, 805 F.3d at 321) (brackets omit-\nted).  That holding cannot be reconciled with the Third \nCircuit\u2019s view that the Section 6330 proceeding in this \ncase \u201cis not moot\u201d even though the IRS withdrew its pro-\nposed levy.  Id. at 2a. \n\n8 \n \nRespondent is thus wrong in contending (Br. in Opp. \n12-13) that the D.C. Circuit would be \u201cfree to agree with \nthe Third Circuit in a future case with a liability dis-\npute.\u201d  Though Willson involved a \u201ccontinuing contro-\nversy\u201d over whether the taxpayer was entitled to a \u201cre-\nturn\u201d of certain funds, 805 F.3d at 318, the D.C. Circuit \nheld that the Section 6330 proceeding was moot in \u201cthe \nabsence of a pending levy,\u201d id. at 321.  The D.C. Circuit \nexplained:  \u201cWith no levy being placed upon Willson\u2019s \nproperty, there was no actual case in controversy re-\ngarding his appeal of such a levy action.\u201d  Ibid. (brack-\nets, citation, and ellipsis omitted).  That holding makes \nclear that the outcome of this case would have been dif-\nferent if it had arisen in the D.C. Circuit.  And the fact \nthat Willson turned on \u201cthe absence of a pending levy\u201d \nforecloses any possibility that the D.C. Circuit might \nagree with the Third Circuit in a future case.  Ibid. \nRespondent\u2019s own arguments in support of the deci-\nsion below highlight the conflict with Willson.  In de-\nfending the Third Circuit\u2019s decision, respondent argues \nthat the government is \u201cincorrect\u201d that \u201cthe \u2018only relief \nthat Section 6330 authorizes is rejection of a proposed \nlevy.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Br. in Opp. 23 (quoting Pet. 14 n.2).  The D.C. Cir-\ncuit in Willson, however, agreed with the government \nthat the rejection of a proposed levy is \u201call the relief \nthat section 6330 authorizes the tax court to grant.\u201d  805 \nF.3d at 321.  Willson thus held that a Section 6330 pro-\nceeding is moot when \u201c[t]he IRS no longer seeks to levy \non [the taxpayer\u2019s] property,\u201d ibid.\u2014a holding that di-\nrectly conflicts with the Third Circuit\u2019s decision below. \nb. The Third Circuit also recognized that its decision \nin this case \u201cpart[s] ways\u201d with the Fourth Circuit\u2019s de-\ncision in McLane v. Commissioner, 24 F.4th 316, cert. \ndenied, 143 S. Ct. 408 (2022).  Pet. App. 27a.  Yet respond-\n\n9 \n \nent denies the existence of that conflict as well.  Con-\ntrary to respondent\u2019s contention (Br. in Opp. 3), how-\never, McLane did not \u201chold only that a \u00a7 6330 Tax Court \nproceeding becomes moot when the government stops \npursuing the levy and the parties don\u2019t dispute the un-\nderlying tax liability.\u201d  Instead, McLane held that a Sec-\ntion 6330 proceeding is moot when a taxpayer \u201cno longer \nfaces\u201d a levy.  24 F.4th at 319.  That holding contradicts \nthe Third Circuit\u2019s decision in this case, which held that \na Section 6330 proceeding \u201cis not moot\u201d even though re-\nspondent no longer faces a levy.  Pet. App. 2a. \nRespondent likewise errs in asserting (Br. in Opp. \n12-13) that the Fourth Circuit would be \u201cfree to agree \nwith the Third Circuit in a future case with a liability \ndispute.\u201d  After all, McLane itself was a case with a lia-\nbility dispute:  The taxpayer \u201ccontend[ed] that the phrase \n\u2018underlying tax liability\u2019  * * *  confer[red] jurisdiction \non the Tax Court to determine that he overpaid and [to] \norder a refund.\u201d  24 F.4th at 318.  But whereas the Third \nCircuit found \u201cnothing in \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B) to suggest that \na taxpayer\u2019s right to challenge the existence or amount \nof her underlying tax becomes moot once the levy is no \nlonger being enforced,\u201d Pet. App. 26a-27a, the Fourth \nCircuit in McLane found just the opposite\u2014namely, that \n\u201c[t]he phrase \u2018underlying tax liability\u2019 does not provide \nthe Tax Court jurisdiction over independent overpay-\nment claims when the collection action no longer ex-\nists,\u201d 24 F.4th at 319.  Because the Fourth Circuit con-\nstrued that phrase more \u201cnarrowly\u201d than the Third Cir-\ncuit did in this case, Pet. App. 27a, the conflict between \nthe circuits is square. \nAttempting to distinguish McLane on its facts, re-\nspondent notes that the taxpayer in that case sought a \nrefund for the first time in the Tax Court.  Br. in Opp. 29 \n\n10 \n \n(citing McLane, 24 F.4th at 318).  But that fact played \nno role in the Fourth Circuit\u2019s reasoning.  Instead, the \nFourth Circuit held that \u201cthe \u2018taxpayer was permitted \nto challenge the amount of his underlying liability in the \n[Section 6330] hearing  . . .  only in the context of deter-\nmining whether the collection action could proceed.\u2019\u200a\u201d  \nMcLane, 24 F.4th at 319 (citation omitted).  And because \nthe taxpayer \u201cno longer face[d] such an action,\u201d the Sec-\ntion 6330 proceeding was moot.  Ibid. \n2. As the petition explains (at 16), the Third Circuit\u2019s \ndecision in this case also conflicts with decisions of other \ncircuits recognizing that the Tax Court possesses only \nthat jurisdiction expressly authorized by Congress.  Re-\nspondent contends (Br. in Opp. 30-31) that none of those \nother decisions addressed whether the Tax Court has \njurisdiction to review offsets in a Section 6330 proceed-\ning.  But each of the other circuits\u2019 decisions recognized \nthat the Tax Court may exercise jurisdiction only to the \nextent expressly authorized.  See Pet. 16.  And respond-\nent makes no attempt to reconcile that fundamental \nprinciple with the decision below\u2014which, as respondent \nacknowledges (Br. in Opp. 3), held that \u201cthe Tax Court \nhas \u2018implicit\u2019 jurisdiction to review IRS offsets in \u00a7 6330 \nproceedings.\u201d \n3. Finally, respondent asserts (Br. in Opp. 11-12) that \nthe question presented \u201crarely arises and is of little prac-\ntical importance to the workable administration of the \ntax laws.\u201d  That is incorrect.  As the petition explains, \nthere are tens of thousands of Section 6330 proceedings \neach year, see Pet. 16-17, and the question presented \narises each time \u201cthere is no longer a live dispute over \nthe proposed levy that gave rise to [such a] proceeding,\u201d \nPet. I.  Contrary to respondent\u2019s contention (Br. in Opp. \n32-33), moreover, the decision below threatens signifi-\n\n11 \n \ncant practical consequences\u2014not only by expanding the \nscope of Section 6330 proceedings far beyond what Con-\ngress contemplated, see Pet. 17, but also by embracing \na theory of \u201cimplicit\u201d Tax Court jurisdiction unbounded \nby any statutory text, Pet. App. 20a.\n*  *  *  *  * \nFor the foregoing reasons and those stated in the  \npetition for a writ of certiorari, the petition should be \ngranted. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nBRIAN H.

As the D.C. and Fourth Circuits \nhave held, that special pre-deprivation proceeding be-\ncomes moot when the IRS no longer needs to pursue a \nlevy.  But the Third Circuit in this case openly \u201cpart[ed] \nways\u201d with those circuits, Pet. App. 27a, holding that a \nSection 6330 proceeding may continue even in the ab-\nsence of any pending levy.  Respondent\u2019s attempts to de-\nfend that decision misunderstand the text of the statute \nthat Congress enacted.  And respondent\u2019s denial of the \nexistence of a circuit split contradicts what the decision \nitself acknowledges.  The petition for a writ of certiorari \nshould be granted. \n\n2 \n \nA. Respondent\u2019s Efforts To Defend The Decision Below \nLack Merit \nAs the petition explains (at 8-14), the Section 6330 \nproceeding in this case is moot because there is no longer \na live dispute over the proposed levy that prompted the \nproceeding.  The court of appeals\u2019 contrary decision is \nwrong, Pet. App. 16a-39a, and respondent\u2019s efforts to de-\nfend it lack merit. \n1. Because there is no longer a live dispute over the \nproposed levy in this case, the Section 6330 proceeding \nis moot \nAs an Article I court, \u201c[t]he Tax Court is a court of \nlimited jurisdiction.\u201d  Commissioner v. McCoy, 484 U.S. \n3, 7 (1987) (per curiam); see 26 U.S.C. 7441.  In a Section \n6330 proceeding, the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction is limited \nto reviewing a particular \u201cdetermination\u201d by the IRS \nIndependent Office of Appeals (Appeals Office): a \u201cde-\ntermination\u201d whether the proposed levy may proceed.  26 \nU.S.C. 6330(c)(3) and (d)(1).  When there is no longer a \nlive controversy over the proposed levy, there is no longer \nany need for such a determination, and the Section 6330 \nproceeding is \u201cmoot.\u201d  Willson v. Commissioner, 805 F.3d \n316, 321 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (citation omitted).  That is so \n\u201cnotwithstanding the existence of other live controver-\nsies between the taxpayer and the IRS that do not fall \nwithin the tax court\u2019s jurisdiction\u201d under Section 6330.  \nId. at 320. \nRespondent does not dispute that there is no longer \na live controversy over the proposed levy in this case.  \nIn fact, respondent acknowledges (Br. in Opp. 20) that \n\u201cthe IRS decided to stop pursuing the levy\u201d after it was \nable to use respondent\u2019s overpayments to offset her tax \nliability under 26 U.S.C. 6402(a).  That should be the end \nof the matter.  Because there is no longer any need for \n\n3 \n \na determination whether the proposed levy may go for-\nward, the Section 6330 proceeding in this case is moot. \n2. Respondent\u2019s contrary arguments are unpersuasive \nIn concluding that the Section 6330 proceeding in this \ncase is not moot, the court of appeals held that (a) the \nTax Court still has jurisdiction to consider respondent\u2019s \n\u201cunderlying tax liability,\u201d Pet. App. 26a (citation omit-\nted), and (b) the IRS\u2019s exercise of statutory authority to \noffset respondent\u2019s tax liability was \u201cinvalid,\u201d id. at 25a.  \nRespondent\u2019s arguments in support of the first holding \nlack merit, and respondent does not even attempt to de-\nfend the second holding. \na. The Tax Court lacks jurisdiction to consider \n\u201cthe underlying tax liability\u201d when there is no \nlive dispute over the proposed levy \nRespondent contends (Br. in Opp. 12) that \u201cSection \n6330 authorizes the Tax Court to review the Appeals Of-\nfice\u2019s determination of a taxpayer\u2019s underlying liability \nand to issue declaratory relief accordingly, notwithstand-\ning the IRS\u2019s decision to stop pursuing a levy.\u201d  That is \nincorrect.  The only determination that Section 6330 au-\nthorizes the Tax Court to review is the Appeals Office\u2019s \n\u201cdetermination\u201d whether a proposed levy may proceed.  \n26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3) and (d)(1).  Here, for example, the \n\u201cNotice of Determination\u201d issued by the Appeals Office \nspecifies that the Office \u201chas determined to sustain the \naction (levy).\u201d  Pet. App. 61a, 64a (capitalization altered).  \nAnd the only relief that Section 6330 authorizes upon \nreview of that determination is rejection of the proposed \nlevy.  See Willson, 805 F.3d at 321.1 \n \n1 Section 6330(e)(1) is not to the contrary.  That provision merely \nauthorizes the Tax Court to enjoin \u201cthe beginning of a levy or pro-\nceeding during\u201d the pendency of a Section 6330 proceeding.  26 U.S.C. \n \n\n4 \n \nOf course, in \u201cdetermin[ing]\u201d whether a proposed \nlevy may proceed, the Appeals Office may consider var-\nious subsidiary issues, including \u201cchallenges to the ex-\nistence or amount of the underlying tax liability  * * *   \nif the person did not receive any statutory notice of de-\nficiency for such tax liability or did not otherwise have \nan opportunity to dispute such tax liability.\u201d  26 U.S.C. \n6330(c)(2)(B) and (3).2  But the text of Section 6330 makes \nclear that when there is no longer any live dispute over \nthe proposed levy, there is no longer any jurisdiction to \nconsider challenges about those subsidiary issues.  The \nstatute does not identify them as freestanding issues, \nbut rather as ones that \u201c[t]he determination\u201d about the \nproposed levy \u201cshall take into consideration,\u201d 26 U.S.C. \n6330(c)(3)\u2014confirming that when the \u201cproposed levy is \nmoot,\u201d a taxpayer \u201chas no independent basis\u201d to continue \npursuing those challenges, Greene-Thapedi v. Commis-\n \n6330(e)(1).  Contrary to respondent\u2019s suggestion (Br. in Opp. 23), Sec-\ntion 6330(e)(1) does not authorize the Tax Court to \u201cdeclare [a tax-\npayer\u2019s] liability\u201d\u2014let alone authorize that court to issue any relief \nin the absence of a pending levy. \n2 Like the court of appeals, respondent characterizes her challenge \nto the IRS\u2019s allocation of estimated payments in this case as a chal-\nlenge to \u201cthe underlying tax liability.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B); see \nBr. in Opp. 14, 19; Pet. App. 17a-19a.  The government disputes that \ncharacterization; in its view, respondent\u2019s challenge presents an \u201cis-\nsue relating to the unpaid tax,\u201d 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(A), which a tax-\npayer could raise in the course of a live controversy over a proposed \nlevy even if the taxpayer had previously received a \u201cstatutory notice \nof deficiency,\u201d 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B).  See Gov\u2019t C.A. Supp. Br. 24-\n25.  This dispute over the characterization of respondent\u2019s challenge, \nhowever, has no bearing on the correct answer to the question pre-\nsented.  Even under respondent\u2019s characterization of her challenge, \nthe Section 6330 proceeding in this case is moot because a taxpayer \nmay challenge \u201cthe underlying tax liability\u201d only in connection with \na determination about a proposed levy.  See Pet. 10-11. \n\n5 \n \nsioner, 126 T.C. 1, 8 (2006).  And Congress\u2019s use of the \nphrase \u201cunderlying tax liability\u201d reinforces the infer-\nence that jurisdiction exists only in connection with a \npre-deprivation determination about a proposed levy.  \n26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B) (emphasis added); see Pet. 11.  \nRespondent therefore errs in asserting (Br. in Opp. 18) \nthat \u201c[n]othing in \u00a7 6330 purports to condition the Tax \nCourt\u2019s ongoing jurisdiction on the IRS\u2019s continued pur-\nsuit of a levy.\u201d \nContrary to respondent\u2019s contention (Br. in Opp. 15-\n16), the statutory history and context undermine, rather \nthan support, her interpretation of Section 6330.  Con-\ngress enacted Section 6330 on the view that \u201c[d]ue pro-\ncess\u201d warrants giving taxpayers notice and an oppor-\ntunity to be heard before the IRS engages in a particu-\nlar type of collection action: a levy on a taxpayer\u2019s prop-\nerty.  Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Re-\nform Act of 1998, Pub. L. No. 105-206, Tit. III, \u00a7 3401(b), \n112 Stat. 747.  When the IRS decides that it no longer \nneeds to levy on the taxpayer\u2019s property, that rationale \nfor a pre-deprivation proceeding no longer applies. \nCongress\u2019s 2006 amendment to Section 6330 does not \nsuggest otherwise.  Section 6330(d)(1) originally granted \nboth the Tax Court and district courts jurisdiction to re-\nview the Appeals Office\u2019s determinations, depending on \nthe type of tax at issue.  26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1) (Supp. IV \n1998).  The 2006 amendment simply revised Section \n6330(d)(1) to make the Tax Court the sole court with ju-\nrisdiction to review those determinations.  Pension Pro-\ntection Act of 2006, Pub. L. No. 109-280, \u00a7 855(a), 120 \nStat. 1019.  Nothing about that amendment suggests that \na Section 6330 proceeding may continue without any \nlive dispute over a proposed levy. \n\n6 \n \nRespondent attempts to analogize Section 6330 to \nfederal statutes that make \u201cjurisdiction \u2018depend upon \nthe state of things at the time of the action brought.\u2019\u200a\u201d  \nBr. in Opp. 16 (brackets and citation omitted).  But those \nanalogies fail because Section 6330 limits the Tax Court\u2019s \njurisdiction to review of a particular kind of \u201cdetermi-\nnation\u201d: a \u201cdetermination\u201d whether the proposed levy \nmay proceed.  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3) and (d)(1).  When there \nis no longer any need for such a determination, the Sec-\ntion 6330 proceeding is moot. \nFinally, respondent invokes \u201cthe presumption favor-\ning judicial review of administrative action.\u201d  Br. in Opp. \n23 (quoting Guerrero-Lasprilla v. Barr, 589 U.S. 221, \n229 (2020)).  But that presumption is inapplicable here \nbecause the government\u2019s interpretation of Section 6330 \ndoes not eliminate judicial review.  See Pet. 14.  As re-\nspondent acknowledges, taxpayers in her position may \nstill \u201chead to court\u201d by filing a refund suit\u2014the tradi-\ntional mechanism for disputing the assessment or col-\nlection of a federal tax, and the one that is available \nwhether or not there was ever a proposed levy to trigger \nSection 6330.  Br. in Opp. 4; see, e.g., id. at 2 (acknowl-\nedging that \u201ctaxpayers can file refund suits anyway\u201d); \nid. at 13 (acknowledging that \u201cthe taxpayer can sepa-\nrately sue the government for a refund under [26 U.S.C.] \n7422\u201d). \nb. The Tax Court lacks jurisdiction to review offsets \nin a Section 6330 proceeding \nIn concluding that the Section 6330 proceeding in this \ncase is not moot, the court of appeals also held that the \nIRS\u2019s exercise of statutory authority to offset respond-\nent\u2019s tax liability was invalid.  Pet. App. 19a-25a.  Re-\nspondent makes no attempt to defend that holding, see \nBr. in Opp. 3-4, 13, 18-19, and for good reason.  As the pe-\n\n7 \n \ntition explains (at 12-14), no statute grants the Tax Court \njurisdiction to review the IRS\u2019s exercise of statutory  \nauthority to credit a taxpayer\u2019s overpayments against \nher tax liability.  And in any event, even if the Tax Court \nhad such jurisdiction, and even if the offsets were inva-\nlid, there would still be no live controversy over whether \nthe proposed levy may proceed\u2014as would be required \nfor the Tax Court to be able to consider respondent\u2019s  \nchallenge to \u201cthe underlying tax liability.\u201d  26 U.S.C. \n6330(c)(2)(B); see Pet. 10-11, 13.  The court of appeals\u2019 \nattempt to avoid a mootness problem by deeming the \noffsets invalid therefore fails. \nB. Respondent\u2019s Attempts To Minimize The Need For This \nCourt\u2019s Review Are Unavailing \n1. As the petition explains (at 14-16), the Third Cir-\ncuit\u2019s decision in this case conflicts with decisions of the \nD.C. and Fourth Circuits. \na. The Third Circuit itself recognized that its deci-\nsion \u201cpart[s] ways\u201d with the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision in \nWillson v. Commissioner, supra.  Pet. App. 27a.  Re-\nspondent nevertheless denies the existence of a conflict, \nasserting (Br. in Opp. 12) that Willson \u201cheld only that a \n\u00a7 6330 proceeding becomes moot if the IRS decides to \nstop pursuing the levy and no dispute about the tax-\npayer\u2019s liability remains.\u201d  But that is not what Willson \nheld.  Rather, as the decision below acknowledged, Will-\nson held that \u201cthere is \u2018no appropriate course of action \nfor the Tax Court to take but to dismiss a case as moot\u2019 \nwhen the IRS withdraws its proposed levy.\u201d  Pet. App. \n27a (quoting Willson, 805 F.3d at 321) (brackets omit-\nted).  That holding cannot be reconciled with the Third \nCircuit\u2019s view that the Section 6330 proceeding in this \ncase \u201cis not moot\u201d even though the IRS withdrew its pro-\nposed levy.  Id. at 2a. \n\n8 \n \nRespondent is thus wrong in contending (Br. in Opp. \n12-13) that the D.C. Circuit would be \u201cfree to agree with \nthe Third Circuit in a future case with a liability dis-\npute.\u201d  Though Willson involved a \u201ccontinuing contro-\nversy\u201d over whether the taxpayer was entitled to a \u201cre-\nturn\u201d of certain funds, 805 F.3d at 318, the D.C. Circuit \nheld that the Section 6330 proceeding was moot in \u201cthe \nabsence of a pending levy,\u201d id. at 321.  The D.C. Circuit \nexplained:  \u201cWith no levy being placed upon Willson\u2019s \nproperty, there was no actual case in controversy re-\ngarding his appeal of such a levy action.\u201d  Ibid. (brack-\nets, citation, and ellipsis omitted).  That holding makes \nclear that the outcome of this case would have been dif-\nferent if it had arisen in the D.C. Circuit.  And the fact \nthat Willson turned on \u201cthe absence of a pending levy\u201d \nforecloses any possibility that the D.C. Circuit might \nagree with the Third Circuit in a future case.  Ibid. \nRespondent\u2019s own arguments in support of the deci-\nsion below highlight the conflict with Willson.  In de-\nfending the Third Circuit\u2019s decision, respondent argues \nthat the government is \u201cincorrect\u201d that \u201cthe \u2018only relief \nthat Section 6330 authorizes is rejection of a proposed \nlevy.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Br. in Opp. 23 (quoting Pet. 14 n.2).  The D.C. Cir-\ncuit in Willson, however, agreed with the government \nthat the rejection of a proposed levy is \u201call the relief \nthat section 6330 authorizes the tax court to grant.\u201d  805 \nF.3d at 321.  Willson thus held that a Section 6330 pro-\nceeding is moot when \u201c[t]he IRS no longer seeks to levy \non [the taxpayer\u2019s] property,\u201d ibid.\u2014a holding that di-\nrectly conflicts with the Third Circuit\u2019s decision below. \nb. The Third Circuit also recognized that its decision \nin this case \u201cpart[s] ways\u201d with the Fourth Circuit\u2019s de-\ncision in McLane v. Commissioner, 24 F.4th 316, cert. \ndenied, 143 S. Ct. 408 (2022).  Pet. App. 27a.  Yet respond-\n\n9 \n \nent denies the existence of that conflict as well.  Con-\ntrary to respondent\u2019s contention (Br. in Opp. 3), how-\never, McLane did not \u201chold only that a \u00a7 6330 Tax Court \nproceeding becomes moot when the government stops \npursuing the levy and the parties don\u2019t dispute the un-\nderlying tax liability.\u201d  Instead, McLane held that a Sec-\ntion 6330 proceeding is moot when a taxpayer \u201cno longer \nfaces\u201d a levy.  24 F.4th at 319.  That holding contradicts \nthe Third Circuit\u2019s decision in this case, which held that \na Section 6330 proceeding \u201cis not moot\u201d even though re-\nspondent no longer faces a levy.  Pet. App. 2a. \nRespondent likewise errs in asserting (Br. in Opp. \n12-13) that the Fourth Circuit would be \u201cfree to agree \nwith the Third Circuit in a future case with a liability \ndispute.\u201d  After all, McLane itself was a case with a lia-\nbility dispute:  The taxpayer \u201ccontend[ed] that the phrase \n\u2018underlying tax liability\u2019  * * *  confer[red] jurisdiction \non the Tax Court to determine that he overpaid and [to] \norder a refund.\u201d  24 F.4th at 318.  But whereas the Third \nCircuit found \u201cnothing in \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B) to suggest that \na taxpayer\u2019s right to challenge the existence or amount \nof her underlying tax becomes moot once the levy is no \nlonger being enforced,\u201d Pet. App. 26a-27a, the Fourth \nCircuit in McLane found just the opposite\u2014namely, that \n\u201c[t]he phrase \u2018underlying tax liability\u2019 does not provide \nthe Tax Court jurisdiction over independent overpay-\nment claims when the collection action no longer ex-\nists,\u201d 24 F.4th at 319.  Because the Fourth Circuit con-\nstrued that phrase more \u201cnarrowly\u201d than the Third Cir-\ncuit did in this case, Pet. App. 27a, the conflict between \nthe circuits is square. \nAttempting to distinguish McLane on its facts, re-\nspondent notes that the taxpayer in that case sought a \nrefund for the first time in the Tax Court.  Br. in Opp. 29 \n\n10 \n \n(citing McLane, 24 F.4th at 318).  But that fact played \nno role in the Fourth Circuit\u2019s reasoning.  Instead, the \nFourth Circuit held that \u201cthe \u2018taxpayer was permitted \nto challenge the amount of his underlying liability in the \n[Section 6330] hearing  . . .  only in the context of deter-\nmining whether the collection action could proceed.\u2019\u200a\u201d  \nMcLane, 24 F.4th at 319 (citation omitted).  And because \nthe taxpayer \u201cno longer face[d] such an action,\u201d the Sec-\ntion 6330 proceeding was moot.  Ibid. \n2. As the petition explains (at 16), the Third Circuit\u2019s \ndecision in this case also conflicts with decisions of other \ncircuits recognizing that the Tax Court possesses only \nthat jurisdiction expressly authorized by Congress.  Re-\nspondent contends (Br. in Opp. 30-31) that none of those \nother decisions addressed whether the Tax Court has \njurisdiction to review offsets in a Section 6330 proceed-\ning.  But each of the other circuits\u2019 decisions recognized \nthat the Tax Court may exercise jurisdiction only to the \nextent expressly authorized.  See Pet. 16.  And respond-\nent makes no attempt to reconcile that fundamental \nprinciple with the decision below\u2014which, as respondent \nacknowledges (Br. in Opp. 3), held that \u201cthe Tax Court \nhas \u2018implicit\u2019 jurisdiction to review IRS offsets in \u00a7 6330 \nproceedings.\u201d \n3. Finally, respondent asserts (Br. in Opp. 11-12) that \nthe question presented \u201crarely arises and is of little prac-\ntical importance to the workable administration of the \ntax laws.\u201d  That is incorrect.  As the petition explains, \nthere are tens of thousands of Section 6330 proceedings \neach year, see Pet. 16-17, and the question presented \narises each time \u201cthere is no longer a live dispute over \nthe proposed levy that gave rise to [such a] proceeding,\u201d \nPet. I.  Contrary to respondent\u2019s contention (Br. in Opp. \n32-33), moreover, the decision below threatens signifi-\n\n11 \n \ncant practical consequences\u2014not only by expanding the \nscope of Section 6330 proceedings far beyond what Con-\ngress contemplated, see Pet. 17, but also by embracing \na theory of \u201cimplicit\u201d Tax Court jurisdiction unbounded \nby any statutory text, Pet. App. 20a.\n*  *  *  *  * \nFor the foregoing reasons and those stated in the  \npetition for a writ of certiorari, the petition should be \ngranted. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nBRIAN H.

Lavar Taylor is a tax controversy \npractitioner with over 43 years of experience in \nhandling \njudicial \nand \nadministrative \ntax \ncontroversies. His experience includes working for the \nDepartment of Justice as an Assistant United States \nAttorney in the Tax Division of the United States \nAttorney\u2019s Office for the Central District of California, \nas a Senior Attorney for the Internal Revenue Service \n(\u201cIRS\u201d) Office of Chief Counsel, and for taxpayers as \nan attorney in private practice. Mr. Taylor is an \nAdjunct Professor at the Chapman Fowler School of \nLaw where he teaches Federal Tax Procedure, and \nhas served as an Adjunct Professor of Law at the \nUniversity of California, Irvine, School of Law. Mr. \nTaylor and his firm have represented taxpayers in \nmany hundreds of Collection Due Process appeals at \nthe administrative level and in many Collection Due \nProcess cases at the judicial level. Mr. Taylor has been \npersonally involved as a private practitioner in over \n300 cases brought in the U.S. Tax Court (\u201cTax \nCourt\u201d), and has personally been involved in \nnumerous additional tax-related cases in the U.S. \n \n1 No person other than the named Amicus or their counsel \nauthored this Brief or provided financial support for this Brief. \n\n2 \n \n \n \nDistrict Courts (\u201cDistrict Courts\u201d), U.S. Courts of \nAppeal, and this Court as a private practitioner. \nAmicus is filing this brief in support of \nRespondent  Jennifer Zuch.2 The question presented \nin this case is important from the standpoint of tax \nadministration, although the specific outcome of this \nappeal will affect only a narrow subset of taxpayers.  \nIn 1998, Congress explicitly granted taxpayers \nthe right  to challenge the \u201cexistence or amount\u201d of tax \nliabilities in administrative and judicial Collection \nDue Process proceedings brought pursuant to 26 \nU.S.C. \u00a76330 if the taxpayer \u201cdid not receive any \nstatutory notice of deficiency for such tax liability or \ndid not otherwise have an opportunity to dispute such \ntax liability.\u201d See, e.g., Montgomery v. Commissioner, \n122 T.C. 1 (2004) (taxpayer allowed to challenge the \namount of an unpaid liability shown on a \u201cbalance \ndue\u201d personal income tax return).  \nThis was a dramatic change from existing law. \nPrior to the enactment of \u00a76330,  taxpayers against \nwhom the IRS assessed unpaid liabilities without \nfirst issuing a notice of deficiency could generally \ninitiate a judicial challenge to  a disputed liability \n \n2 Amicus regularly represents clients of the type whose interests \ncould be affected by the outcome of this case, but Amicus has not \nbeen retained by any client (or by any third party) for the \npurpose of filing this Brief as Amicus Curiae. \n\n3 \n \n \n \nonly by paying the disputed liability in full, filing a \nclaim for refund, and then filing suit for refund in \nFederal District Court or the Court of Federal Claims. \nSee generally Flora v. United States, 362 U.S. 145 \n(1960). Under prior law, taxpayers such as the \ntaxpayer in Montgomery would have had to pay the \ntax in full, file a claim for refund, and then file suit to \nrecover the refund in District Court or the Court of \nFederal Claims to challenge the \u201cexistence or amount\u201d \nof the unpaid tax debt. Id. That is no longer the case. \nThis significant new opportunity for taxpayers \nto judicially challenge the merits of a disputed \nliability was prompted by a Congressional perception \nthat the IRS was treating taxpayers unfairly, forcing \ntaxpayers to endure hardships in order to pay \ndisputed liabilities that ultimately were not owed. See \nBrief for Respondent at pp. 9-10, 36-37. To remedy the \nperceived unfair treatment of taxpayers, Congress \nchanged the law by giving taxpayers the right to \njudicially challenge the existence or amount of a tax \nliability in what are now called Collection Due \nProcess appeals if the taxpayers did not receive a \nnotice of deficiency or did not otherwise have an \nopportunity to challenge a disputed tax liability. \nThe IRS here improperly asks this Court to \nimpose limitations on an important right granted to \ntaxpayers by Congress.  The limitations requested by \nIRS have no statutory basis and make no practical \nsense.  Furthermore, the IRS agrees that the Tax \n\n4 \n \n \n \nCourt had jurisdiction to decide the dispute regarding \nthe tax liability at issue at the time the Tax Court \npetition was filed and yet argues that the taxpayer\u2019s \nsubsequent payment of the tax through offsets of tax \nrefunds destroys the jurisdiction of the Tax Court to \ndecide this dispute. This argument, if accepted by this \nCourt, would require taxpayers to begin litigating the \ndisputed issue anew, in a completely different forum, \nwhere the cost of litigation is typically far greater \nthan the cost of litigation in the Tax Court. \nIn other words, the IRS\u2019s position in this case \nincentivizes taxpayers who prefer litigating in the \nTax Court instead of litigating in a refund forum \n(which is most taxpayers) to refrain from paying a \ndisputed tax liability while they are challenging \u201cthe \nexistence or amount\u201d of a disputed, previously unpaid, \ntax liability in Tax Court in a Collection Due Process \ncase. It is strange indeed that the IRS would advocate \nfor a result that discourages most taxpayers from \npaying a previously unpaid liability while they are \nlitigating the merits of a disputed tax liability in Tax \nCourt in a Collection Due Process case.   \nThe IRS also claims the dispute here is \u201cmoot\u201d \ndespite the fact that the IRS and the taxpayer \ncontinue to disagree sharply as to whether the \ntaxpayer is entitled to a withholding credit against \nthe tax liability in question. It is not possible for a case \nto be \u201cmoot\u201d where a taxpayer and the IRS remain in \ndisagreement regarding the resolution of one of the \n\n5 \n \n \n \nissues that caused the taxpayer to initiate the \nlitigation. \nAmicus supports Ms. Zuch in her efforts to \nprevent the IRS (and some lower courts) from taking \naway an important right granted to taxpayers by \nCongress merely because the taxpayer (involuntarily) \npays a disputed tax liability while a Collection Due \nProcess case is pending in Tax Court. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe IRS\u2019s argument that the Tax Court lost \njurisdiction to resolve the dispute between Ms. Zuch \nand the IRS regarding the disputed estimated tax \npayments after that Court previously obtained \njurisdiction over Ms. Zuch\u2019s case makes no sense. \nThere is nothing in the statutory language that \nindicates that the Tax Court should lose the \njurisdiction it obtained over the case earlier just \nbecause the IRS\u2019s refund offsets fully paid the \ndisputed liability. \nThe  IRS agrees that the Declaratory Judgment \nAct did not bar the Tax Court from granting relief to \nthe taxpayer prior to full payment of the disputed \nliability. The Act likewise does not bar the Tax Court \nfrom granting relief after full payment of the disputed \nliability, as the effect of granting relief in either \nsituation is the same, i.e., to give the taxpayer the \neconomic benefit of the disputed estimated tax credit.. \n\n6 \n \n \n \nA partial payment of the disputed liability \nthrough a refund offset while the case is pending in \nTax Court does not causes the Tax Court to lose \njurisdiction over the dispute, per the IRS. But such a \npartial payment does raise the question of whether \nthe Tax Court can order a refund if the Tax Court \nlater rules that the disputed tax liability against \nwhich the tax refund was offset is not owed. This issue \narises whether the later refund offset pays the \ndisputed liability in part or in full. Thus, the \npurported inability of the Tax Court to order a refund \nin this situation is irrelevant to the resolution of the \nquestion of whether a later refund offset that fully \npays the disputed liability deprives the Tax Court of \njurisdiction to resolve the disputed tax liability.  \nThe Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction in Collection Due \nProcess cases is not as narrow as the IRS contends. \nThe Tax Court has previously ordered the IRS to \nrefund money to a taxpayer in a Collection Due \nProcess case. The Ninth Circuit has held that the Tax \nCourt has the authority to apply the full range of \nequitable principles generally granted to courts that \npossess judicial powers in Collection Due Process \ncases. In any event, the Tax Court in Collection Due \nProcess cases can issue orders to the IRS that require \nthe IRS to take steps that will generate refunds for \ntaxpayers. \nIf the Tax Court does lack jurisdiction to order \nrefunds to taxpayers in Collection Due Process cases, \n\n7 \n \n \n \ntaxpayers can take certain steps to protect their \ninterests. But the potential absence of authority of the \nTax Court to issue refunds in Collection Due Process \ncases has no relevance to the resolution of the present \ndispute. \n \nThe IRS\u2019s argument that the case is moot is \nmeritless. A case cannot be moot when the parties still \ndisagree about the resolution of an issue that has \nbeen raised in the litigation. \n \nSection 6330 is a remedial statute and thus \nshould be construed with its remedial purpose in \nmind. The position advocated by the IRS, if adopted \nby this Court, would create additional burdens on and \ncosts to taxpayers who find themselves in the \nsituation in which Ms. Zuch finds herself. Taxpayers \ncould be required to \u201cstart over\u201d in a new court after \nmany years of litigating in Tax Court and in \nsubsequent appeals. Taxpayers who owe taxes for \nmultiple years could find themselves having to \nlitigate in two different courts simultaneously \nbecause a refund offset fully pays only one of multiple \ntax liabilities. \n \nThe mere act of forcing taxpayers to litigate tax \ndisputes in District Courts will impose significant \nburdens on taxpayers. District Courts, unlike the Tax \nCourt (where most litigants are unrepresented), are \nnot \u201ctaxpayer friendly.\u201d Unrepresented taxpayers \nunfamiliar with District Court procedures may \n\n8 \n \n \n \nsimply give up, particularly if they cannot afford \nrepresentation in District Court.  The cost of \nrepresentation in District Court tax litigation is \nnormally much higher than the cost of such \nrepresentation in the Tax Court, making representing \ninfeasible for taxpayers of modest means. \n \nStatistics show that taxpayers overwhelming \nprefer to litigate tax disputes in the Tax Court. \n \nThe IRS fails to acknowledge that Congress \nchanged the \u201cpay first \u2013 litigate later\u201d rule governing \nthe litigation of the merits of tax liabilities for \ntaxpayers who pursue Collection Due Process \nappeals. The IRS\u2019s assertion that a ruling for Ms. \nZuch will improperly open the floodgates to disputes \nregarding the merits of the underlying liability in \nCollection Due Process cases is completely without \nmerit. The IRS\u2019s use of incomplete statistics does not \nsupport their argument.  \n \nMore importantly, because Congress has \nchanged the \u201cold rules\u201d to allow taxpayers to \nchallenge the merits of an unpaid tax liability in \nCollection Due Process cases, all taxpayers, including \nMs. Zuch, who meet the requirements for challenging \nunpaid liabilities in Collection Due Process appeals \nshould be allowed to bring such a challenge. \n \n\n9 \n \n \n \nARGUMENT \nA. The IRS\u2019s Argument That the Tax Court \nLost Jurisdiction That the IRS Agrees the \nTax Court Had at the Start of the Tax \nCourt Case Makes No Sense \n \nThe Tax Court undisputedly had jurisdiction to \nresolve all of the issues raised by Ms. Zuch in her \nadministrative Collection Due Process Appeal, \nincluding the disputed estimated tax payment, at the \ntime Ms. Zuch filed her Tax Court petition. Even the \nIRS agrees with this point.  \nMs. Zuch filed a timely request for an \nadministrative Collection Due Process hearing with \nthe IRS\u2019s Office of Appeals in response to a Notice of \nIntent to Levy issued pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a76330(b). \nThat request triggered  the duty of the Office of \nAppeals to perform an independent verification \nprocess pursuant to \u00a76330(b)(1) and to consider all \nissues raised by the taxpayer in their administrative \nappeal. 26 U.S.C. \u00a76330(c)(2)(B). \nMs. Zuch raised the issue of whether she was \nentitled to the disputed withholding credit in her \nadministrative Collection Due Process Appeal. Thus, \nthe Office of Appeals was required to consider this \nargument in making its formal Determination. Id. \nHad the Office of Appeals failed to consider this issue \nin its determination, it would have constituted legal \n\n10 \n \n \n \nerror. See, e.g., Loveland v. Commissioner, 151 T.C. 78 \n(2018). \nMs. Zuch then filed a timely petition with the \nTax \nCourt, \nseeking \nreview \nof \nthe \nformal \nDetermination \nby \nthe \nOffice \nof \nAppeals, \na \nDetermination which denied her request that the IRS \ncredit her tax liability with the disputed withholding \ncredit. \u00a76330(d)(1) explicitly states that the Tax Court \nreviews the formal Determination by the Office of \nAppeals and has jurisdiction to do so. Because Ms. \nZuch raised the issue of the disputed withholding \ncredit in her administrative Collection Due Process \nAppeal, and because the Office of Appeals fulfilled its \nstatutory duty to consider that issue in its formal \nDetermination, the Tax Court acquired jurisdiction to \nreview the issue of the disputed withholding credit \nonce a timely Tax Court petition was filed. \nThat should be the beginning and the end the \nstory. There is nothing in the text of the statute \ngranting jurisdiction to the Tax Court the divests that \nCourt of jurisdiction to decide whether Ms. Zuch is \nentitled to the disputed withholding credit merely \nbecause the \u201cunderlying liability\u201d is paid in full \nthrough offsets of refunds owed to Ms. Zuch after the \nTax Court acquired jurisdiction to decide this \nquestion. \nThe various arguments offered by the IRS in an \neffort to avoid the result mandated by the \n\n11 \n \n \n \nstraightforward language of the statute make no \nsense.  For example, the IRS argues that it would be \na violation of the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a72201, for the Tax Court to rule on the issue of \ndisputed withholding credit after the refund offsets \nhave reduced the balance owed to the IRS to zero. \nThis cannot be the case, though. A ruling by the \nTax Court on the issue of the disputed withholding \ncredit prior to any refund offsets is legally no different \nthan such a ruling by the Tax Court after the refund \noffsets. It is the same issue, and will have the same \nlegal effect, both before and after any refund offsets \nare made. In both situations, a ruling for the IRS will \nprevent Ms. Zuch from getting the economic benefit of \nthe disputed withholding credits.  And in both \nsituations a ruling for Ms. Zuch will allow her to get \nthe economic benefit of the disputed withholding \ncredit.  If a ruling by the Tax Court on this issue prior \nto the full payment of the disputed liability through \nrefund offsets would not have been in violation of the \nDeclaratory Judgment Act, a point the IRS appears to \nconcede, there is no logical reason why a ruling by the \nTax Court on this issue after the refund offsets \noccurred would violate the Declaratory Judgment Act. \nThe IRS\u2019s concession that a ruling by the Tax \nCourt on the issue of the disputed withholding credit \nprior to any refund offsets does not violate the \nDeclaratory Judgment Act is well-founded. It would \nmake no sense to interpret \u00a76330(d) in a manner that \n\n12 \n \n \n \nprevents the Tax Court from exercising plenary \nreview of all issues addressed in the Determination of \nthe Office of Appeals, given that the language of \n\u00a76330(d)(1) does not place any limitations upon the \nTax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to review the Determination.    \nIt makes no sense to interpret the language of \n\u00a76330(d)(1) any differently merely because the IRS \nlater grabbed multiple tax refunds of Ms. Zuch to pay \nthe unpaid portion of the tax debt that the IRS \nclaimed that she owed at the outset of the Tax Court \nlitigation. In either scenario, the Tax Court has \njurisdiction to decide the issue of the disputed \nwithholding credit. \nCuriously, it appears that the IRS does not \ncontend that a mere reduction of the unpaid portion \nof the tax debt that existed at the outset of the Tax \nCourt case through later refund offsets causes the \njurisdiction of the Tax Court to disappear.  Per the \nIRS, if there was a refund offset that left $1.00 (one \ndollar) of the \u201cunderlying liability\u201d unpaid, the Tax \nCourt would still have jurisdiction to decide the issue \nof the disputed withholding credit.   \nThis point illustrates the folly of the IRS\u2019s \nargument that this Court should rule against Ms. \nZuch because the Tax Court allegedly lacks the \nauthority to direct the IRS to issue refunds in \nCollection Due Process cases. If the purported \ninability of the Tax Court to order the IRS to issue a \n\n13 \n \n \n \nrefund in a Collection Due Process case where a \nrefund offset reduces the \u201cunderlying liability\u201d to a \nvery small amount during the pendency of the Tax \nCourt case is not a basis for causing the Tax Court\u2019s \njurisdiction to magically disappear, this purported \ninability to order a refund should not be a basis for \ncausing the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to disappear \nmerely because the refund offsets fully pay the \nliability. \nWhile the complete scope of the Tax Court\u2019s \nauthority in Collection Due Process cases is not at \nissue in this case, the IRS\u2019s cramped view of the scope \nof the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction in Collection Due \nProcess cases lacks merit. The Tax Court has \npreviously directed the IRS to refund money to a \ntaxpayer in a Collection Due Process case where the \nIRS took the taxpayer\u2019s money via levy without first \nsending the taxpayer the statutorily required Notice \nof Intent to Levy under  \u00a76330(d)(1). See Chocallo v. \nCommissioner, T.C. Memo 2004-152 (2004).  \nThe Tax Court has also ordered the IRS to \ncredit a taxpayer\u2019s liability for the amount of the \ndecrease in value of stock seized by the IRS in a \nCollection Due Process case where the taxpayer \nrequested the IRS to promptly sell the seized stock, \ndue to a concern that the stock might become \nvalueless, and the IRS failed  to sell the stock as \nrequested.  See Zapara v. Commissioner, 652 F.3d \n1042 (9th Cir, 2011), affirming 124 T.C. 223 (2005), as \n\n14 \n \n \n \nsupplemented, 126 T.C. 215 (2006).  The Ninth Circuit \nstated that, in that Collection Due Process case, the \n\u201cTax Courts have \u2018the authority to apply the full range \nof equitable principles generally granted to courts \nthat possess judicial powers\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted). 652 \nF.3d at1045-46. \nEven assuming, arguendo, that the Tax Court \ncannot issue an order directing the IRS to issue a \nrefund pursuant to a final order in a Collection Due \nProcess case, which is seemingly a dubious \nproposition, the Tax Court can clearly issue an order \nthe IRS to take steps to implement the Court\u2019s \nholding on an issue properly before the Court that \nresult in the IRS issuing a refund. For example, the \nTax Court could issue an order directing the IRS to \ncredit Ms. Zuch\u2019s account for the tax year at issue for \nthe amount of the disputed withholding credit, if she \nprevails at trial in the Tax Court.  Such an order, once \nit becomes final, would create a duty on behalf of the \nIRS to credit her account.  That would generate a \nrefund. \nIf the Tax Court\u2019s power to order the IRS to \nissue a refund in a Collection Due Process case is \nlimited, taxpayers, once they learn of refund offsets \nmade while they are challenging the \u201cexistence or \namount\u201d of a previously unpaid liability in Tax Court \nin a Collection Due Process case, can protect their \ninterests by filing formal  refund claims pending a \nresolution of the Collection Due Process case. If they \n\n15 \n \n \n \nfail to file a formal refund claim, they may be able to \nlater argue that they previously submitted an \ninformal refund claim.  See United States v. Kales, 314 \nU.S. 186 (1941), United States v. Commer. Nat\u2019l Bank, \n874 F.2d 1165 (7th Cir. 1989)(Informal letter to IRS \nAppeals Officer sent during protracted dispute with \nthe IRS constituted a valid informal refund claim).  \nPresumably the IRS would honor a final Tax \nCourt order favoring the taxpayer. If not, in certain \ncircumstances, the taxpayer might avail themselves \nof a suit under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71361.  See Vishnevsky v. \nUnited States, 581 F.2d 1249 (7th Cir. 1978).   \nNone of this, however, provides any support for \nholding that the Tax Court loses jurisdiction to \nresolve a disputed tax liability in Collection Due \nProcess case merely because the IRS collects the full \namount of the previously unpaid liability through \nrefund offsets while the Collection Due Process case \nis pending in the Tax Court. \nThe IRS\u2019s argument that Ms. Zuch\u2019s entire case \nbecame \u201cmoot\u201d due to the offset of her tax refunds is \nself-evidently wrong. Ms. Zuch and the IRS still do not \nagree whether she is entitled to the disputed \nwithholding credit. The fact that the \u201clevy\u201d issue was \nmooted by all of the refund offsets does not render the \nentire case moot and, as explained above, does not \ndeprive the Tax Court of jurisdiction over the dispute \nunder the relevant statutory scheme. \n\n16 \n \n \n \nB.  Section 6330 is a Remedial Statute and \nShould be Interpreted With Its Remedial \nPurpose in Mind \nSection 6330, and its companion statute, 26 \nU.S.C. \u00a76320, were enacted to provide additional \nremedies to taxpayers, due to perceived abusive \nconduct by the IRS.  The Brief for Respondent, at pp.  \n9-10, 36-37, does an excellent job of laying this out. \nGiven that the purpose of the enactment of the \nCollection Due Process provisions is to benefit \ntaxpayers, these provisions should be interpreted in a \nmanner consistent with that purpose. \nThe IRS espouses a position that, if adopted by \nthis Court, would create additional difficulties, costs \nand burdens for taxpayers who were not able to pay \ntheir taxes in the first place and, who, during the \ncourse of litigating the existence or amount of a \npreviously unpaid liability in a Collection Due Process \ncase in Tax Court, find themselves in the unusual \nposition of paying in full the previously unpaid taxes \nthrough refund offsets. \nFor example, suppose that a taxpayer prevails \non a challenge to the existence or amount of a \npreviously unpaid liability in Tax Court in a \nCollection Due Process case after a two year battle, \nand the IRS then appeals the Tax Court\u2019s holding. For \ntaxpayers residing the in Ninth Circuit, this type of \nappeal will typically take 18 to 24 months from entry \n\n17 \n \n \n \nof judgment in the Tax Court. Immediately after oral \nargument in the Court of Appeals, which could be 3 or \n4 years after the start of the Tax Court case, the \npreviously un\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Lavar Taylor is a tax controversy \npractitioner with over 43 years of experience in \nhandling \njudicial \nand \nadministrative \ntax \ncontroversies. His experience includes working for the \nDepartment of Justice as an Assistant United States \nAttorney in the Tax Division of the United States \nAttorney\u2019s Office for the Central District of California, \nas a Senior Attorney for the Internal Revenue Service \n(\u201cIRS\u201d) Office of Chief Counsel, and for taxpayers as \nan attorney in private practice. Mr. Taylor is an \nAdjunct Professor at the Chapman Fowler School of \nLaw where he teaches Federal Tax Procedure, and \nhas served as an Adjunct Professor of Law at the \nUniversity of California, Irvine, School of Law. Mr. \nTaylor and his firm have represented taxpayers in \nmany hundreds of Collection Due Process appeals at \nthe administrative level and in many Collection Due \nProcess cases at the judicial level. Mr. Taylor has been \npersonally involved as a private practitioner in over \n300 cases brought in the U.S. Tax Court (\u201cTax \nCourt\u201d), and has personally been involved in \nnumerous additional tax-related cases in the U.S. \n \n1 No person other than the named Amicus or their counsel \nauthored this Brief or provided financial support for this Brief. \n\n2 \n \n \n \nDistrict Courts (\u201cDistrict Courts\u201d), U.S. Courts of \nAppeal, and this Court as a private practitioner. \nAmicus is filing this brief in support of \nRespondent  Jennifer Zuch.2 The question presented \nin this case is important from the standpoint of tax \nadministration, although the specific outcome of this \nappeal will affect only a narrow subset of taxpayers.  \nIn 1998, Congress explicitly granted taxpayers \nthe right  to challenge the \u201cexistence or amount\u201d of tax \nliabilities in administrative and judicial Collection \nDue Process proceedings brought pursuant to 26 \nU.S.C. \u00a76330 if the taxpayer \u201cdid not receive any \nstatutory notice of deficiency for such tax liability or \ndid not otherwise have an opportunity to dispute such \ntax liability.\u201d See, e.g., Montgomery v. Commissioner, \n122 T.C. 1 (2004) (taxpayer allowed to challenge the \namount of an unpaid liability shown on a \u201cbalance \ndue\u201d personal income tax return).  \nThis was a dramatic change from existing law. \nPrior to the enactment of \u00a76330,  taxpayers against \nwhom the IRS assessed unpaid liabilities without \nfirst issuing a notice of deficiency could generally \ninitiate a judicial challenge to  a disputed liability \n \n2 Amicus regularly represents clients of the type whose interests \ncould be affected by the outcome of this case, but Amicus has not \nbeen retained by any client (or by any third party) for the \npurpose of filing this Brief as Amicus Curiae. \n\n3 \n \n \n \nonly by paying the disputed liability in full, filing a \nclaim for refund, and then filing suit for refund in \nFederal District Court or the Court of Federal Claims. \nSee generally Flora v. United States, 362 U.S. 145 \n(1960). Under prior law, taxpayers such as the \ntaxpayer in Montgomery would have had to pay the \ntax in full, file a claim for refund, and then file suit to \nrecover the refund in District Court or the Court of \nFederal Claims to challenge the \u201cexistence or amount\u201d \nof the unpaid tax debt. Id. That is no longer the case. \nThis significant new opportunity for taxpayers \nto judicially challenge the merits of a disputed \nliability was prompted by a Congressional perception \nthat the IRS was treating taxpayers unfairly, forcing \ntaxpayers to endure hardships in order to pay \ndisputed liabilities that ultimately were not owed. See \nBrief for Respondent at pp. 9-10, 36-37. To remedy the \nperceived unfair treatment of taxpayers, Congress \nchanged the law by giving taxpayers the right to \njudicially challenge the existence or amount of a tax \nliability in what are now called Collection Due \nProcess appeals if the taxpayers did not receive a \nnotice of deficiency or did not otherwise have an \nopportunity to challenge a disputed tax liability. \nThe IRS here improperly asks this Court to \nimpose limitations on an important right granted to \ntaxpayers by Congress.  The limitations requested by \nIRS have no statutory basis and make no practical \nsense.  Furthermore, the IRS agrees that the Tax \n\n4 \n \n \n \nCourt had jurisdiction to decide the dispute regarding \nthe tax liability at issue at the time the Tax Court \npetition was filed and yet argues that the taxpayer\u2019s \nsubsequent payment of the tax through offsets of tax \nrefunds destroys the jurisdiction of the Tax Court to \ndecide this dispute. This argument, if accepted by this \nCourt, would require taxpayers to begin litigating the \ndisputed issue anew, in a completely different forum, \nwhere the cost of litigation is typically far greater \nthan the cost of litigation in the Tax Court. \nIn other words, the IRS\u2019s position in this case \nincentivizes taxpayers who prefer litigating in the \nTax Court instead of litigating in a refund forum \n(which is most taxpayers) to refrain from paying a \ndisputed tax liability while they are challenging \u201cthe \nexistence or amount\u201d of a disputed, previously unpaid, \ntax liability in Tax Court in a Collection Due Process \ncase. It is strange indeed that the IRS would advocate \nfor a result that discourages most taxpayers from \npaying a previously unpaid liability while they are \nlitigating the merits of a disputed tax liability in Tax \nCourt in a Collection Due Process case.   \nThe IRS also claims the dispute here is \u201cmoot\u201d \ndespite the fact that the IRS and the taxpayer \ncontinue to disagree sharply as to whether the \ntaxpayer is entitled to a withholding credit against \nthe tax liability in question. It is not possible for a case \nto be \u201cmoot\u201d where a taxpayer and the IRS remain in \ndisagreement regarding the resolution of one of the \n\n5 \n \n \n \nissues that caused the taxpayer to initiate the \nlitigation. \nAmicus supports Ms. Zuch in her efforts to \nprevent the IRS (and some lower courts) from taking \naway an important right granted to taxpayers by \nCongress merely because the taxpayer (involuntarily) \npays a disputed tax liability while a Collection Due \nProcess case is pending in Tax Court. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe IRS\u2019s argument that the Tax Court lost \njurisdiction to resolve the dispute between Ms. Zuch \nand the IRS regarding the disputed estimated tax \npayments after that Court previously obtained \njurisdiction over Ms. Zuch\u2019s case makes no sense. \nThere is nothing in the statutory language that \nindicates that the Tax Court should lose the \njurisdiction it obtained over the case earlier just \nbecause the IRS\u2019s refund offsets fully paid the \ndisputed liability. \nThe  IRS agrees that the Declaratory Judgment \nAct did not bar the Tax Court from granting relief to \nthe taxpayer prior to full payment of the disputed \nliability. The Act likewise does not bar the Tax Court \nfrom granting relief after full payment of the disputed \nliability, as the effect of granting relief in either \nsituation is the same, i.e., to give the taxpayer the \neconomic benefit of the disputed estimated tax credit.. \n\n6 \n \n \n \nA partial payment of the disputed liability \nthrough a refund offset while the case is pending in \nTax Court does not causes the Tax Court to lose \njurisdiction over the dispute, per the IRS. But such a \npartial payment does raise the question of whether \nthe Tax Court can order a refund if the Tax Court \nlater rules that the disputed tax liability against \nwhich the tax refund was offset is not owed. This issue \narises whether the later refund offset pays the \ndisputed liability in part or in full. Thus, the \npurported inability of the Tax Court to order a refund \nin this situation is irrelevant to the resolution of the \nquestion of whether a later refund offset that fully \npays the disputed liability deprives the Tax Court of \njurisdiction to resolve the disputed tax liability.  \nThe Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction in Collection Due \nProcess cases is not as narrow as the IRS contends. \nThe Tax Court has previously ordered the IRS to \nrefund money to a taxpayer in a Collection Due \nProcess case. The Ninth Circuit has held that the Tax \nCourt has the authority to apply the full range of \nequitable principles generally granted to courts that \npossess judicial powers in Collection Due Process \ncases. In any event, the Tax Court in Collection Due \nProcess cases can issue orders to the IRS that require \nthe IRS to take steps that will generate refunds for \ntaxpayers. \nIf the Tax Court does lack jurisdiction to order \nrefunds to taxpayers in Collection Due Process cases, \n\n7 \n \n \n \ntaxpayers can take certain steps to protect their \ninterests. But the potential absence of authority of the \nTax Court to issue refunds in Collection Due Process \ncases has no relevance to the resolution of the present \ndispute. \n \nThe IRS\u2019s argument that the case is moot is \nmeritless. A case cannot be moot when the parties still \ndisagree about the resolution of an issue that has \nbeen raised in the litigation. \n \nSection 6330 is a remedial statute and thus \nshould be construed with its remedial purpose in \nmind. The position advocated by the IRS, if adopted \nby this Court, would create additional burdens on and \ncosts to taxpayers who find themselves in the \nsituation in which Ms. Zuch finds herself. Taxpayers \ncould be required to \u201cstart over\u201d in a new court after \nmany years of litigating in Tax Court and in \nsubsequent appeals. Taxpayers who owe taxes for \nmultiple years could find themselves having to \nlitigate in two different courts simultaneously \nbecause a refund offset fully pays only one of multiple \ntax liabilities. \n \nThe mere act of forcing taxpayers to litigate tax \ndisputes in District Courts will impose significant \nburdens on taxpayers. District Courts, unlike the Tax \nCourt (where most litigants are unrepresented), are \nnot \u201ctaxpayer friendly.\u201d Unrepresented taxpayers \nunfamiliar with District Court procedures may \n\n8 \n \n \n \nsimply give up, particularly if they cannot afford \nrepresentation in District Court.  The cost of \nrepresentation in District Court tax litigation is \nnormally much higher than the cost of such \nrepresentation in the Tax Court, making representing \ninfeasible for taxpayers of modest means. \n \nStatistics show that taxpayers overwhelming \nprefer to litigate tax disputes in the Tax Court. \n \nThe IRS fails to acknowledge that Congress \nchanged the \u201cpay first \u2013 litigate later\u201d rule governing \nthe litigation of the merits of tax liabilities for \ntaxpayers who pursue Collection Due Process \nappeals. The IRS\u2019s assertion that a ruling for Ms. \nZuch will improperly open the floodgates to disputes \nregarding the merits of the underlying liability in \nCollection Due Process cases is completely without \nmerit. The IRS\u2019s use of incomplete statistics does not \nsupport their argument.  \n \nMore importantly, because Congress has \nchanged the \u201cold rules\u201d to allow taxpayers to \nchallenge the merits of an unpaid tax liability in \nCollection Due Process cases, all taxpayers, including \nMs. Zuch, who meet the requirements for challenging \nunpaid liabilities in Collection Due Process appeals \nshould be allowed to bring such a challenge. \n \n\n9 \n \n \n \nARGUMENT \nA. The IRS\u2019s Argument That the Tax Court \nLost Jurisdiction That the IRS Agrees the \nTax Court Had at the Start of the Tax \nCourt Case Makes No Sense \n \nThe Tax Court undisputedly had jurisdiction to \nresolve all of the issues raised by Ms. Zuch in her \nadministrative Collection Due Process Appeal, \nincluding the disputed estimated tax payment, at the \ntime Ms. Zuch filed her Tax Court petition. Even the \nIRS agrees with this point.  \nMs. Zuch filed a timely request for an \nadministrative Collection Due Process hearing with \nthe IRS\u2019s Office of Appeals in response to a Notice of \nIntent to Levy issued pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a76330(b). \nThat request triggered  the duty of the Office of \nAppeals to perform an independent verification \nprocess pursuant to \u00a76330(b)(1) and to consider all \nissues raised by the taxpayer in their administrative \nappeal. 26 U.S.C. \u00a76330(c)(2)(B). \nMs. Zuch raised the issue of whether she was \nentitled to the disputed withholding credit in her \nadministrative Collection Due Process Appeal. Thus, \nthe Office of Appeals was required to consider this \nargument in making its formal Determination. Id. \nHad the Office of Appeals failed to consider this issue \nin its determination, it would have constituted legal \n\n10 \n \n \n \nerror. See, e.g., Loveland v. Commissioner, 151 T.C. 78 \n(2018). \nMs. Zuch then filed a timely petition with the \nTax \nCourt, \nseeking \nreview \nof \nthe \nformal \nDetermination \nby \nthe \nOffice \nof \nAppeals, \na \nDetermination which denied her request that the IRS \ncredit her tax liability with the disputed withholding \ncredit. \u00a76330(d)(1) explicitly states that the Tax Court \nreviews the formal Determination by the Office of \nAppeals and has jurisdiction to do so. Because Ms. \nZuch raised the issue of the disputed withholding \ncredit in her administrative Collection Due Process \nAppeal, and because the Office of Appeals fulfilled its \nstatutory duty to consider that issue in its formal \nDetermination, the Tax Court acquired jurisdiction to \nreview the issue of the disputed withholding credit \nonce a timely Tax Court petition was filed. \nThat should be the beginning and the end the \nstory. There is nothing in the text of the statute \ngranting jurisdiction to the Tax Court the divests that \nCourt of jurisdiction to decide whether Ms. Zuch is \nentitled to the disputed withholding credit merely \nbecause the \u201cunderlying liability\u201d is paid in full \nthrough offsets of refunds owed to Ms. Zuch after the \nTax Court acquired jurisdiction to decide this \nquestion. \nThe various arguments offered by the IRS in an \neffort to avoid the result mandated by the \n\n11 \n \n \n \nstraightforward language of the statute make no \nsense.  For example, the IRS argues that it would be \na violation of the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a72201, for the Tax Court to rule on the issue of \ndisputed withholding credit after the refund offsets \nhave reduced the balance owed to the IRS to zero. \nThis cannot be the case, though. A ruling by the \nTax Court on the issue of the disputed withholding \ncredit prior to any refund offsets is legally no different \nthan such a ruling by the Tax Court after the refund \noffsets. It is the same issue, and will have the same \nlegal effect, both before and after any refund offsets \nare made. In both situations, a ruling for the IRS will \nprevent Ms. Zuch from getting the economic benefit of \nthe disputed withholding credits.  And in both \nsituations a ruling for Ms. Zuch will allow her to get \nthe economic benefit of the disputed withholding \ncredit.  If a ruling by the Tax Court on this issue prior \nto the full payment of the disputed liability through \nrefund offsets would not have been in violation of the \nDeclaratory Judgment Act, a point the IRS appears to \nconcede, there is no logical reason why a ruling by the \nTax Court on this issue after the refund offsets \noccurred would violate the Declaratory Judgment Act. \nThe IRS\u2019s concession that a ruling by the Tax \nCourt on the issue of the disputed withholding credit \nprior to any refund offsets does not violate the \nDeclaratory Judgment Act is well-founded. It would \nmake no sense to interpret \u00a76330(d) in a manner that \n\n12 \n \n \n \nprevents the Tax Court from exercising plenary \nreview of all issues addressed in the Determination of \nthe Office of Appeals, given that the language of \n\u00a76330(d)(1) does not place any limitations upon the \nTax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to review the Determination.    \nIt makes no sense to interpret the language of \n\u00a76330(d)(1) any differently merely because the IRS \nlater grabbed multiple tax refunds of Ms. Zuch to pay \nthe unpaid portion of the tax debt that the IRS \nclaimed that she owed at the outset of the Tax Court \nlitigation. In either scenario, the Tax Court has \njurisdiction to decide the issue of the disputed \nwithholding credit. \nCuriously, it appears that the IRS does not \ncontend that a mere reduction of the unpaid portion \nof the tax debt that existed at the outset of the Tax \nCourt case through later refund offsets causes the \njurisdiction of the Tax Court to disappear.  Per the \nIRS, if there was a refund offset that left $1.00 (one \ndollar) of the \u201cunderlying liability\u201d unpaid, the Tax \nCourt would still have jurisdiction to decide the issue \nof the disputed withholding credit.   \nThis point illustrates the folly of the IRS\u2019s \nargument that this Court should rule against Ms. \nZuch because the Tax Court allegedly lacks the \nauthority to direct the IRS to issue refunds in \nCollection Due Process cases. If the purported \ninability of the Tax Court to order the IRS to issue a \n\n13 \n \n \n \nrefund in a Collection Due Process case where a \nrefund offset reduces the \u201cunderlying liability\u201d to a \nvery small amount during the pendency of the Tax \nCourt case is not a basis for causing the Tax Court\u2019s \njurisdiction to magically disappear, this purported \ninability to order a refund should not be a basis for \ncausing the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to disappear \nmerely because the refund offsets fully pay the \nliability. \nWhile the complete scope of the Tax Court\u2019s \nauthority in Collection Due Process cases is not at \nissue in this case, the IRS\u2019s cramped view of the scope \nof the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction in Collection Due \nProcess cases lacks merit. The Tax Court has \npreviously directed the IRS to refund money to a \ntaxpayer in a Collection Due Process case where the \nIRS took the taxpayer\u2019s money via levy without first \nsending the taxpayer the statutorily required Notice \nof Intent to Levy under  \u00a76330(d)(1). See Chocallo v. \nCommissioner, T.C. Memo 2004-152 (2004).  \nThe Tax Court has also ordered the IRS to \ncredit a taxpayer\u2019s liability for the amount of the \ndecrease in value of stock seized by the IRS in a \nCollection Due Process case where the taxpayer \nrequested the IRS to promptly sell the seized stock, \ndue to a concern that the stock might become \nvalueless, and the IRS failed  to sell the stock as \nrequested.  See Zapara v. Commissioner, 652 F.3d \n1042 (9th Cir, 2011), affirming 124 T.C. 223 (2005), as \n\n14 \n \n \n \nsupplemented, 126 T.C. 215 (2006).  The Ninth Circuit \nstated that, in that Collection Due Process case, the \n\u201cTax Courts have \u2018the authority to apply the full range \nof equitable principles generally granted to courts \nthat possess judicial powers\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted). 652 \nF.3d at1045-46. \nEven assuming, arguendo, that the Tax Court \ncannot issue an order directing the IRS to issue a \nrefund pursuant to a final order in a Collection Due \nProcess case, which is seemingly a dubious \nproposition, the Tax Court can clearly issue an order \nthe IRS to take steps to implement the Court\u2019s \nholding on an issue properly before the Court that \nresult in the IRS issuing a refund. For example, the \nTax Court could issue an order directing the IRS to \ncredit Ms. Zuch\u2019s account for the tax year at issue for \nthe amount of the disputed withholding credit, if she \nprevails at trial in the Tax Court.  Such an order, once \nit becomes final, would create a duty on behalf of the \nIRS to credit her account.  That would generate a \nrefund. \nIf the Tax Court\u2019s power to order the IRS to \nissue a refund in a Collection Due Process case is \nlimited, taxpayers, once they learn of refund offsets \nmade while they are challenging the \u201cexistence or \namount\u201d of a previously unpaid liability in Tax Court \nin a Collection Due Process case, can protect their \ninterests by filing formal  refund claims pending a \nresolution of the Collection Due Process case. If they \n\n15 \n \n \n \nfail to file a formal refund claim, they may be able to \nlater argue that they previously submitted an \ninformal refund claim.  See United States v. Kales, 314 \nU.S. 186 (1941), United States v. Commer. Nat\u2019l Bank, \n874 F.2d 1165 (7th Cir. 1989)(Informal letter to IRS \nAppeals Officer sent during protracted dispute with \nthe IRS constituted a valid informal refund claim).  \nPresumably the IRS would honor a final Tax \nCourt order favoring the taxpayer. If not, in certain \ncircumstances, the taxpayer might avail themselves \nof a suit under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71361.  See Vishnevsky v. \nUnited States, 581 F.2d 1249 (7th Cir. 1978).   \nNone of this, however, provides any support for \nholding that the Tax Court loses jurisdiction to \nresolve a disputed tax liability in Collection Due \nProcess case merely because the IRS collects the full \namount of the previously unpaid liability through \nrefund offsets while the Collection Due Process case \nis pending in the Tax Court. \nThe IRS\u2019s argument that Ms. Zuch\u2019s entire case \nbecame \u201cmoot\u201d due to the offset of her tax refunds is \nself-evidently wrong. Ms. Zuch and the IRS still do not \nagree whether she is entitled to the disputed \nwithholding credit. The fact that the \u201clevy\u201d issue was \nmooted by all of the refund offsets does not render the \nentire case moot and, as explained above, does not \ndeprive the Tax Court of jurisdiction over the dispute \nunder the relevant statutory scheme. \n\n16 \n \n \n \nB.  Section 6330 is a Remedial Statute and \nShould be Interpreted With Its Remedial \nPurpose in Mind \nSection 6330, and its companion statute, 26 \nU.S.C. \u00a76320, were enacted to provide additional \nremedies to taxpayers, due to perceived abusive \nconduct by the IRS.  The Brief for Respondent, at pp.  \n9-10, 36-37, does an excellent job of laying this out. \nGiven that the purpose of the enactment of the \nCollection Due Process provisions is to benefit \ntaxpayers, these provisions should be interpreted in a \nmanner consistent with that purpose. \nThe IRS espouses a position that, if adopted by \nthis Court, would create additional difficulties, costs \nand burdens for taxpayers who were not able to pay \ntheir taxes in the first place and, who, during the \ncourse of litigating the existence or amount of a \npreviously unpaid liability in a Collection Due Process \ncase in Tax Court, find themselves in the unusual \nposition of paying in full the previously unpaid taxes \nthrough refund offsets. \nFor example, suppose that a taxpayer prevails \non a challenge to the existence or amount of a \npreviously unpaid liability in Tax Court in a \nCollection Due Process case after a two year battle, \nand the IRS then appeals the Tax Court\u2019s holding. For \ntaxpayers residing the in Ninth Circuit, this type of \nappeal will typically take 18 to 24 months from entry \n\n17 \n \n \n \nof judgment in the Tax Court. Immediately after oral \nargument in the Court of Appeals, which could be 3 or \n4 years after the start of the Tax Court case, the \npreviously unpaid tax liability is paid in full through \na refund offset. \nAccording to the IRS, the pending appeal from \nthe Tax Court must be dismissed for lack of \njurisdiction, and the taxpayer must start all over \nagain by pursuing a suit for refund, years after the \nstart of the Tax Court case.  This result is completely \nat odds with the purpose for which \u00a76330 was enacted. \nThis result also makes no sense from a practical \nstandpoint.  \nFurthermore, consider a scenario where a \ntaxpayer has unpaid tax liabilities for multiple years \nand is challenging the existence or amounts of those \nmultiple liabilities in a single Collection Due Process \ncase pending before the Tax Court. Suppose that the \nIRS then offsets a tax refund that pays in full only one \nof the multiple liabilities.  According to the IRS, the \nTax Court must dismiss the year that has been paid \nin full for lack of jurisdiction, while retaining \njurisdiction over the years which have not been paid \nin full.  Such a result has previously occurred. See \nAmanda Iris Gluck Irrevocable Trust v. Comm'r, 154 \nT.C. 259 (2020). \nSuch a result forces a taxpayer to start over for \nthe dismissed tax year and to litigate in two \n\n18 \n \n \n \ncompletely different fora.  This result likewise is at \nodds with the purpose for which \u00a76330 was enacted \nand makes no sense from a practical standpoint.  \nThe additional burdens on, and disadvantages \nto, taxpayers in these scenarios under  the IRS\u2019s \nproffered interpretation of \u00a76330 is not limited to \nhaving to start over in a different court and possibly \nhaving \nto \nlitigate \nin \ntwo \ndifferent \nfora \nsimultaneously. Requiring a taxpayer to litigate in \nDistrict Court instead of Tax Court typically imposes \nsignificant practical and financial burdens on \ntaxpayers, to the point where taxpayers may choose \nnot pursue litigation against the IRS if they are not \nallowed to pursue litigation in Tax Court.  \nThe Tax Court, unlike the District Courts, is a \n\u201ctaxpayer friendly\u201d court. Roughly 75% of all \ntaxpayers who litigate before the Tax Court are \nunrepresented.  Discovery rules in Tax Court are very \nrelaxed; formal discovery is prohibited unless the \nparties first engage in informal discovery.  See, \nBranerton Corp. v. Commissioner, 61 T.C. 691 (1974).  \nDistrict Courts, by contrast, are not at all  \n\u201ctaxpayer friendly.\u201d Formal discovery is the norm, \nand an unrepresented taxpayer who is unfamiliar \nwith the formal discovery rules and the motions \npractice associated with District Court litigation will \noften decide to forgo suing the IRS in District Court if \nthey cannot afford representation.  \n\n19 \n \n \n \nThen there is the massive increase in the cost \nof representation in litigation when a taxpayer is \nrequired to litigate in District Court instead of Tax \nCourt. In the experience of amicus, the cost to \nrepresented taxpayers of litigating in District Court \nis often three to four times the cost to represented \ntaxpayers of litigating in Tax Court. The degree of \nthis disparity in the cost of representation in \nlitigation between the two different fora will vary \ndepending on the issues being litigated, but the cost \nof litigating cases in District Court often makes it \nimpractical for taxpayers to pay for representation in \ntax cases in District Court  unless the amount at issue \nis hundreds of thousand dollars or more. For certain \ntypes of tax cases, it may not make economic sense for \ntaxpayers to pay for representation in District Court \nunless the amount at issue is $500,000 or more.  \nThe IRS National Taxpayer Advocate has \nacknowledged that, for most taxpayers, the Tax Court \nis a far better litigation forum than the District \nCourts and, for that reason, has proposed that \nCongress expand the jurisdiction of the Tax Court to \ninclude refund jurisdiction traditionally exercised by \nthe District Courts.  See National Taxpayer Advocate, \n2023 Purple Book, Legislative Recommendation No. \n43, \n95-96 \n(Dec. \n31, \n2022) \n \nlocated \nat \nhttps://www.taxpayeradvocate.irs.gov/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2023/01/ARC22_PurpleBook_07_Str\nengthTPR.pdf (last visited March 22, 2025). \n\n20 \n \n \n \nStatistics regarding the number of pending \ncourt cases involving federal taxes confirm that \ntaxpayers strongly prefer to litigate in Tax Court as \nopposed to litigating in District Court.  As of \nSeptember 30, 2023, IRS Chief Counsel statistics \nreflected that there were 25,653 cases pending in the \nTax Court. (This number includes Tax Court cases of \nall kinds; Collection Due Process cases make up a \nsmall fraction of this total.)  See SOI Tax Stats - Chief \nCounsel Workload: Tax Litigation Cases, by Type of \nCase \n- \nIRS \nData \nBook \nTable \n31, \nhttps://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-chief-\ncounsel-workload-tax-litigation-cases-by-type-of- \ncase-irs-data-book-table-29 (last visited March 22, \n2025). \nBy way of contrast, only 714 refund cases were \npending nationwide as of June 30, 2023. Id.  Simply \nput, taxpayers generally prefer to litigate in the Tax \nCourt, due to the significant cost and inconvenience \nassociated with litigating tax cases in District Court. \nPer the records available at the above irs.gov website, \na similar disparity between the number of pending \nTax Court cases and the number of pending District \nCourt cases has existed for every year going back to \n1997, the year before Congress enacted the Collection \nDue Process provisions.  Id.  \nGiven this background, it makes no sense to \nconstrue \u00a76330 in a manner that creates more \ndifficulties for, and financial burdens on, taxpayers \n\n21 \n \n \n \nsuch as Ms. Zuch by forcing them to litigate in District \nCourt. \nC.  The IRS May Not Ignore the Fact That \nCongress \nHas \nChanged \nThe \nRules \nRegarding Litigation of the Merits of Tax \nLiabilities for Taxpayers in Collection \nDue Process Appeals; In Any Event, the \nIRS\u2019s Assertion That a Ruling For Ms. \nZuch Will Generate a Flood of New \nLitigation is Meritless \nThe IRS fails to properly acknowledge that \nCongress significantly changed the rules regarding \nthe litigation of the merits of tax liabilities when \nCongress enacted \u00a76330. The IRS states at page 2 of \nits Brief for Petitioner that \u201c[t]he federal tax system \noperates on a simple default premise: pay now, \ndispute later.\u201d But Congress modified those rules for \ntaxpayers in Collection Due Process Appeals. This \ncase is not about the rules as they existed prior to the \nenactment of the Collection Due Process Appeals \nprovisions.  This case is about the changes to the law \nenacted by Congress in 1998. \nThe significant changes to the law made by \nCongress in 1998 in enacting  \u00a7\u00a76320 and 6330, and \nthe reasons why those changes call for this Court to \ninterpret \u00a76330 in the manner urged by Ms. Zuch, are \neloquently articulated in the Brief for Respondent. \n\n22 \n \n \n \nThe IRS offers no cogent reasons why this Court \nshould not affirm the judgment of the Third Circuit. \nThe IRS\u2019s feeble  \u201cscary statistics\u201d argument \nshould be rejected out of hand. The IRS claims that a \nruling in favor of Ms. Zuch could lead to a flood of new \nlitigation. Brief for Petitioner at p. 24. But the IRS \nfails to explain how a holding that permits the \ncontinuation of a case over which the Tax Court \nalready has jurisdiction after a previously unpaid \nliability is paid through tax refund offsets is going to \nlead to increased litigation by a large number of \nadditional taxpayers.    \nThis case is about whether existing cases in \nwhich taxpayers have the right to challenge the \nexistence or amount of an unpaid liability, and over \nwhich the Tax Court has jurisdiction, will be thrown \nout of court. This case is not about whether taxpayers \nwho previously were not able to pursue a challenge to \nthe existence or amount of an unpaid liability will be \nallowed to do so. \nMore broadly, the notion that a ruling for Ms. \nZuch might cause taxpayers to flock en masse to use \nthe Collection Due Process procedures to challenge \nunpaid liabilities is illogical. Taxpayers cannot \nchallenge the merits of the underlying liability in a \nCollection Due Process appeal under \u00a76320 until the \nIRS has filed a Notice of Federal Tax Lien (\u201cNFTL\u201d) \nagainst the taxpayer. The filing of a NFTL provides \n\n23 \n \n \n \nnotice to the public at large that the IRS believes that \nthe taxpayer owes taxes to the IRS in the amount set \nforth in the NFTL and that the IRS is pursuing \ncollection of those taxes against the party whose \nname(s) are listed as taxpayers in the NFTL.   \nThe filing of the NFTL typically has additional \nadverse consequences for all taxpayers, beyond \nletting the world know that the IRS is pursuing \ncollection of the unpaid tax liability shown on the \nNFTL. The filing of a NFTL can trigger defaults \nunder \nloan \nagreements \nand \nunder \npersonal \nguarantees of loans. It can also significantly curtail \nthe taxpayer\u2019s ability to do business or to keep their \njob. The taxpayer\u2019s ability to borrow funds becomes \nsignificantly limited. Taxpayers cannot encumber or \nsell their real property or most other assets to third \nparties without involving the IRS.  Additional adverse \nconsequences are possible, if not likely.  \nCollection Due Process appeals brought under \n\u00a76330 following the issuance of a Notice of Intent to \nLevy likewise expose taxpayers to situations that are \npotentially harmful. IRS revenue officers are directed \nby the Internal Revenue Manual to decide whether to \nfile a NFTL promptly after beginning work on a case. \nSee IRM 5.12.2.3.2 (10-14-2013). Thus, in most cases, \na levy Collection Due Process proceeding is unlikely \nto take place unless the IRS has already filed a NFTL \nagainst the taxpayer. Furthermore, it is not a \npleasant experience to receive a notice stating that \n\n24 \n \n \n \nthe IRS intends to levy on all of your assets and be \nforced to pursue a levy Collection Due Process appeal \nin order to both protect your assets from levy action \nand challenge the merits of the underlying liability.  \nThe vast majority of Collection Due Process \nAppeals handled by amicus involve simultaneous \nappeals pursued under both \u00a7\u00a76320 and 6330. In that \nregard, the present case is atypical.  \nThe IRS states, at Brief for Petitioner at p.24, \nthat there were 28,349 \u00a76330 Collection Due Process \nappeals closed in 2023. The IRS then suggests that, if \nthe Court rules in favor Ms. Zuch, it will open the \nfloodgates to  challenges to the merits of unpaid \nliabilities \nunder \nthe \nCollection \nDue \nProcess \nprocedures.  \nThe IRS, however, fails to advise the Court \nwhat percentage of those taxpayers disputed their tax \nliabilities in their Collection Due Process Appeals. It \nis probable that only a fraction of those taxpayers \ndisputed the \u201cunderlying liability\u201d in the Collection \nDue Process appeals.   \nThe IRS also fails to inform the Court that \nCollection Due Process appeal cases constitute only a \nsmall fraction  of the Tax Court\u2019s existing caseload \nand that only an unidentified portion of that small \nfraction of the Tax Court\u2019s existing case involves \nchallenges to the existence or amount of the \n\n25 \n \n \n \npreviously unpaid tax liability. Thus, as the Brief for \nRespondent explains, it is unlikely that a ruling in \nfavor of Ms. Zuch will generate a flood of new \nchallenges to the existence or amount of the liability \nin Collection Due Process appeals. \nBut the proper response to the IRS\u2019s argument \non this point is as follows. To the extent any of the \n28,349 taxpayers identified in the relevant Report \nhad a bona fide challenge to the existence or amount \nof the underlying liability, and if they did not receive \na notice of deficiency or did not otherwise have an \nopportunity to dispute the existence or amount of the \nunderlying liability, Congress has made it clear that \nthey were entitled to challenge the existence or \namount of the underlying liability in their Collection \nDue Process appeals. That is true whether the \nnumber of taxpayers choosing to exercise their \nstatutory rights to challenge the existence or amount \nof the underlying liability was a \u201cflood\u201d or a \u201ctrickle.\u201d \nThe IRS\u2019s statement at page 24 of the Brief for \nPetitioner, that \u201c[n]othing in the text or history of \n\u00a76330 supports that end-run around the calibrated \nstatutory framework that generally provides for post-\npayment adjudication of disputes over tax liability,\u201d is \ncategorically untrue. \u00a76330(d) explicitly provides for a \ndeparture from the \u201cold rules.\u201d  \nThe IRS has already conceded that the Tax \nCourt had jurisdiction to determine the amount of Ms. \n\n26 \n \n \n \nZuch\u2019s disputed tax liability in a situation in which \nthe \u201cold rules\u201d would have prohibited the Tax Court \nfrom resolving that dispute. It is disingenuous for the \nIRS to have made the above quoted statement. \nThe IRS, having conceded that the Tax Court \nhad jurisdiction to resolve the disputed regarding the \ndisputed estimated tax credit at the time Ms. Zuch \nfiled her Tax Court petition, now argues for a result \nthat, if adopted by this Court, would actually \ndiscourage taxpayers from paying their disputed tax \nliability while litigating the merits of a disputed \nliability in a Collection Due Process Tax Court case. \nAmicus does not believe that Congress intended such \na result. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n27 \n \n \n \nCONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth above, Amicus urges  \nthis Court to affirm the holding of the Seventh Circuit \nand to remand the case to the Tax Court to determine \nwhether Ms. Zuch is entitled to the disputed \nwithholding credit. \n \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \nA.

App., infra, 1a-9a.  \nINTRODUCTION \nThe federal tax system operates on a simple default \npremise: pay now, dispute later.  In 1998, Congress en-\nacted a narrow exception to that rule.  If the Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS) seeks to levy on\u2014that is, affirm-\natively seize and sell\u2014a taxpayer\u2019s property, the IRS \ngenerally must provide the taxpayer with pre-levy notice \nand an opportunity for a hearing before the IRS Indepen-\ndent Office of Appeals (Appeals Office).  26 U.S.C. 6330.  \nThe Appeals Office makes a \u201cdetermination\u201d whether the \nIRS may proceed with \u201cthe levy action[] which [is] the \nsubject of the requested hearing.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3) \nand (e)(1).  A taxpayer disappointed with the outcome \nof the pre-levy hearing may \u201cpetition the Tax Court for \nreview of such determination.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1).   \nThis case presents the question whether a Section \n6330 proceeding in the Tax Court becomes moot when \nthere is no longer a live controversy over the levy.  Here, \nthe IRS initially proposed a levy on respondent\u2019s prop-\nerty, and she initiated a Section 6330 proceeding for \npre-deprivation review.  But before the Tax Court\u2019s re-\nview concluded, the IRS determined that respondent\u2019s \nintervening, additional payments meant that she no long-\ner owed any additional tax, so the IRS no longer sought \nto collect by levying on her property.   \nThat development mooted the proceeding for pre-\nlevy review.  When the IRS has decided not to pursue its \nproposed levy, the taxpayer has already received \u201cthe \nvery relief [she] ostensibly sought\u201d by requesting a pre-\ndeprivation hearing.  Willson v. Commissioner, 805 \nF.3d 316, 321 (D.C. Cir. 2015).  The Tax Court can pro-\n\n3 \n \nvide no further relief, and the Section 6330 proceeding \nmust end.  \nThe text of Section 6330 makes clear that it provides \na narrow path for review of a proposed levy\u2014not a \nmeans to circumvent the usual methods of disputing a \ntaxpayer\u2019s liability.  The decision below thus erred in \nconcluding that the Tax Court could still address wheth-\ner respondent has any \u201cunderlying tax liability\u201d\u2014an is-\nsue that may be considered under 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B) \nwhen evaluating whether a proposed levy may proceed.  \nWhen there is no proposed levy to adjudicate, the ques-\ntion of tax liability ceases to be an \u201cunderlying\u201d one.  \nNor does the Tax Court have jurisdiction to issue de-\nclaratory relief separate from its ability to enjoin the \nproposed levy that is \u201cthe subject of the requested hear-\ning.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(1). \nThat there is no longer review under Section 6330 \ndoes not foreclose judicial review of the IRS\u2019s handling \nof respondent\u2019s taxes.  Rather, as respondent has al-\nready acknowledged (Br. in Opp. 2, 4, 13, 16, 25), she \ncan proceed under the general rule and dispute the as-\nsessment and collection of her taxes in a refund suit.  \nBecause the court of appeals\u2019 contrary decision thwarts \nCongress\u2019s distinction between that general rule and \nthe narrow exception for pre-levy review, this Court \nshould reverse. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal Background \n1. The traditional mechanism for a taxpayer to dis-\npute the assessment or collection of a federal tax is a \npost-payment suit for a refund.  See CIC Servs., LLC v. \nIRS, 593 U.S. 209, 212 (2021) (\u201c[A] person can typically \nchallenge a federal tax only after he pays it, by suing for \na refund.\u201d).  To bring a refund suit, a taxpayer must first \n\n4 \n \npay the tax and then request a refund from the IRS.   \n26 U.S.C. 6402(a), 6511; 26 C.F.R. 301.6402\u20132; Flora v. \nUnited States, 357 U.S. 63, 64-75 (1958), aff\u200a\u2019d on reh\u2019g, \n362 U.S. 145 (1960).  If the refund is denied, the tax-\npayer may sue to recover the disputed amount.  28 \nU.S.C. 1346(a)(1); see 26 U.S.C. 6532, 7422(a); 28 U.S.C. \n1491(a)(1); United States v. Clintwood Elkhorn Mining \nCo., 553 U.S. 1, 4 (2008); see also, e.g., G.M. Leasing \nCorp. v. United States, 429 U.S. 338, 352 n.18 (1977) \n(collecting cases for the proposition that post-payment \nreview of a tax liability comports with due process).  \nFor certain taxes, however, Congress has also pro-\nvided a pre-assessment avenue for judicial review.  Spe-\ncifically, for income, estate, gift, and various other \ntaxes, Congress has directed the IRS to issue a \u201cnotice \nof  * * *  deficiency\u201d to a taxpayer who has failed to re-\nport a tax properly.  26 U.S.C. 6212(a).  The taxpayer \nmay then file a petition for redetermination in the Tax \nCourt.  26 U.S.C. 6213.  With certain exceptions, the \nIRS may not attempt to collect the tax at issue before \nthe time for seeking judicial review has expired or while \nsuch review is pending.  26 U.S.C. 6213(a).  \nThe Internal Revenue Code and other statutes chan-\nnel judicial review of challenges to tax assessment and \ncollection to those prescribed mechanisms.  The Tax \nAnti-Injunction Act, 26 U.S.C. 7421(a), and the tax ex-\nception to the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. \n2201(a), generally preclude suits for injunctive and de-\nclaratory relief regarding the assessment or collection \nof taxes.  And 26 U.S.C. 7422(a) precludes suits to re-\ncover taxes alleged to have been assessed or collected \nunlawfully before a taxpayer has properly sought a re-\nfund from the IRS. \n\n5 \n \n2. Following assessment, if a taxpayer who is \u201cliable \nto pay any tax neglects or refuses to pay,\u201d the IRS may \ngenerally \u201ccollect such tax\u201d by \u201clevy[ing] upon\u201d the tax-\npayer\u2019s property, i.e., seizing and selling it.  26 U.S.C. \n6331(a); see 26 U.S.C. 6331(b) (defining \u201clevy\u201d to \u201cin-\nclude[] the power of distraint and seizure by any means,\u201d \nand permitting the sale of \u201csuch property or rights to \nproperty\u201d); see also 26 U.S.C. 6321 (providing for tax \nliens).  Certain types of property\u2014including, with some \nexceptions, residences, welfare and unemployment ben-\nefits, and particular pensions\u2014are exempt from levies.  \nSee 26 U.S.C. 6334. \nBefore 1998, the Internal Revenue Code authorized \nthe IRS to levy upon taxpayer property without any \nprior opportunity for a hearing or other pre-collection \nprocess, so long as adequate post-deprivation proce-\ndures were available.  See Phillips v. Commissioner, \n283 U.S. 589, 595 (1931); 26 U.S.C. 6331(d) (1994).  In \n1998, however, Congress established procedures that \nthe IRS generally must follow before levying.  See Tax-\npayer Bill of Rights 3 (Taxpayer Bill of Rights), Pub. L. \nNo. 105-206, Tit. III, \u00a7 3401(b), 112 Stat. 747-749 (26 \nU.S.C. 6330); see also id. \u00a7 3401(a), 112 Stat. 746-747 (26 \nU.S.C. 6320) (substantially similar framework for IRS \nfiling of a notice of federal tax lien).  \nThose procedures are codified in Section 6330 of the \nCode, which is entitled \u201c[n]otice and opportunity for \nhearing before levy.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330.  Under those pro-\ncedures, \u201c[n]o levy may be made\u201d unless the IRS pro-\nvides the taxpayer with 30 days\u2019 notice and the oppor-\ntunity to request a hearing.  26 U.S.C. 6330(a)(1); see 26 \nU.S.C. 6330(a)(2) and (3).   \nIf the taxpayer makes such a request, an administra-\ntive hearing to review the proposed levy\u2014sometimes \n\n6 \n \ncalled a \u201ccollection due process hearing,\u201d Boechler, P.C. \nv. Commissioner, 596 U.S. 199, 202 (2022)\u2014is con-\nducted by an impartial officer in the Appeals Office.  26 \nU.S.C. 6330(b).  The taxpayer\u2019s request for a hearing \nsuspends \u201cthe levy actions which are the subject of the \nrequested hearing\u201d as well as the running of specified \nlimitations periods.  26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(1).   \nAt the hearing, the taxpayer may raise \u201cany relevant \nissue relating to the unpaid tax or the proposed levy,\u201d \nincluding \u201cchallenges to the appropriateness of collec-\ntion actions\u201d and \u201coffers of collection alternatives.\u201d  26 \nU.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(A)(ii) and (iii); see 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(4) \n(excluding certain issues that were previously litigated \nor qualify as frivolous).  If the taxpayer \u201cdid not receive \nany statutory notice of deficiency for [the relevant] tax \nliability or did not otherwise have an opportunity to dis-\npute such tax liability,\u201d she also may raise \u201cchallenges \nto the existence or amount of the underlying tax liabil-\nity.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B). \nAt the conclusion of a Section 6330 hearing, the  \nAppeals Office issues its \u201cdetermination,\u201d 26 U.S.C. \n6330(c)(3), which is \u201ca written notice\u201d reflecting wheth-\ner \u201ccollection by way of levy may proceed.\u201d  Lunsford v. \nCommissioner, 117 T.C. 159, 164-165 (2001).  The Ap-\npeals Office reaches its determination after considering \nstatutorily delineated factors, including whether the re-\nquirements of applicable law or administrative proce-\ndure have been met, 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(1) and (3)(A); the \nissues raised by the taxpayer, 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2) and \n(3); and \u201cwhether any proposed collection action bal-\nances the need for the efficient collection of taxes with \nthe legitimate concern of the [taxpayer] that any collec-\ntion action be no more intrusive than necessary,\u201d 26 \nU.S.C. 6330(c)(3)(C).   \n\n7 \n \nA taxpayer who is dissatisfied with a determination \nsustaining a levy may petition the United States Tax \nCourt \u201cfor review of such determination (and the Tax \nCourt shall have jurisdiction with respect to such mat-\nter).\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1).  The Tax Court\u2019s decision, \nin turn, is subject to review by a federal court of ap-\npeals.  26 U.S.C. 7482(a)(1). \n3. Although a taxpayer\u2019s request for a Section 6330 \nhearing suspends \u201cthe levy actions which are the sub-\nject of the requested hearing\u201d and certain limitations \nperiods, 26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(1), other mechanisms for tax \ncollection may proceed.  Most relevant here, when a tax-\npayer overpays the tax owed for a particular year, the \nIRS \u201cmay credit the amount of such overpayment\u201d \nagainst \u201cany liability in respect of an internal revenue \ntax on the part of the person who made the overpay-\nment\u201d instead of refunding that amount to the taxpayer.  \n26 U.S.C. 6402(a).   \nThat application of overpayment credits\u2014sometimes \nreferred to as an \u201coffset\u201d\u2014is an administrative action \ndistinct from the collection of a tax by a levy or lien on \nthe taxpayer\u2019s property.  See Belloff v. Commissioner, \n996 F.2d 607, 616 (2d Cir. 1993); Boyd v. Commissioner, \n124 T.C. 296, 300 (2005); 26 C.F.R. 301.6330\u20131(g)(2),  \nQ & A-G3.  A taxpayer may challenge the application of \ncredits through the traditional mechanism for disputing \nthe collection of a federal tax: filing a refund claim with \nthe IRS and, if necessary, a refund suit.  See 26 U.S.C. \n7422(a) and (d). \nB. The Present Controversy \n1. From 1993 to 2014, respondent was married to \nPatrick Gennardo.  Pet. App. 7a.  This case concerns the \n2010 tax year, for which respondent and Gennardo ulti-\nmately filed separate tax returns.  Ibid.  \n\n8 \n \na. In 2010 and 2011, respondent and Gennardo made \ntwo estimated tax payments, totaling $50,000, to the \nIRS for tax year 2010.  Pet. App. 8a.  First, the couple \nsubmitted an estimated tax payment of $20,000.  Ibid.  \nThe accompanying Form 1040-ES identified both of \ntheir names, but it did not indicate that they would be \nfiling separate returns, and it provided no instructions \non how to allocate the payment between them.  C.A. \nApp. 274, 314.  Second, Gennardo submitted a $30,000 \nbank check, which identified only Gennardo as the re-\nmitter.  Pet. App. 8a; see C.A. App. 274, 315.  The sub-\nject line of the accompanying cover letter identified \nboth respondent and Gennardo, but neither the check \nnor any accompanying documentation instructed the \nIRS to allocate any part of that payment to respondent.  \nC.A. App. 275, 315, 633, 638. \nb. On September 12, 2012, the couple filed separate \n(and untimely) 2010 federal income-tax returns.  Pet. \nApp. 7a; see C.A. App. 316-381.  Respondent did not claim \nany of the $50,000 in estimated tax payments on her re-\nturn, while Gennardo claimed $10,000 in estimated tax \npayments on his return.  C.A. App. 317, 331. Respond-\nent\u2019s and Gennardo\u2019s tax returns were prepared by the \nsame tax preparer.  Id. at 277. \nOn the same day that they submitted their separate \ntax returns, Gennardo made a written compromise offer \nto the IRS about his outstanding federal tax liabilities \nfor tax years 2007 through 2011.  C.A. App. 278, 382.  \nAlthough the offer covered years in which respondent \nand Gennardo had filed joint tax returns, Gennardo\u2019s  \noffer-in-compromise did not include respond\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

The jurisdiction of this Court rests on 28 \nU.S.C. 1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent statutory provisions are reprinted in an \nappendix to this brief.  App., infra, 1a-9a.  \nINTRODUCTION \nThe federal tax system operates on a simple default \npremise: pay now, dispute later.  In 1998, Congress en-\nacted a narrow exception to that rule.  If the Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS) seeks to levy on\u2014that is, affirm-\natively seize and sell\u2014a taxpayer\u2019s property, the IRS \ngenerally must provide the taxpayer with pre-levy notice \nand an opportunity for a hearing before the IRS Indepen-\ndent Office of Appeals (Appeals Office).  26 U.S.C. 6330.  \nThe Appeals Office makes a \u201cdetermination\u201d whether the \nIRS may proceed with \u201cthe levy action[] which [is] the \nsubject of the requested hearing.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3) \nand (e)(1).  A taxpayer disappointed with the outcome \nof the pre-levy hearing may \u201cpetition the Tax Court for \nreview of such determination.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1).   \nThis case presents the question whether a Section \n6330 proceeding in the Tax Court becomes moot when \nthere is no longer a live controversy over the levy.  Here, \nthe IRS initially proposed a levy on respondent\u2019s prop-\nerty, and she initiated a Section 6330 proceeding for \npre-deprivation review.  But before the Tax Court\u2019s re-\nview concluded, the IRS determined that respondent\u2019s \nintervening, additional payments meant that she no long-\ner owed any additional tax, so the IRS no longer sought \nto collect by levying on her property.   \nThat development mooted the proceeding for pre-\nlevy review.  When the IRS has decided not to pursue its \nproposed levy, the taxpayer has already received \u201cthe \nvery relief [she] ostensibly sought\u201d by requesting a pre-\ndeprivation hearing.  Willson v. Commissioner, 805 \nF.3d 316, 321 (D.C. Cir. 2015).  The Tax Court can pro-\n\n3 \n \nvide no further relief, and the Section 6330 proceeding \nmust end.  \nThe text of Section 6330 makes clear that it provides \na narrow path for review of a proposed levy\u2014not a \nmeans to circumvent the usual methods of disputing a \ntaxpayer\u2019s liability.  The decision below thus erred in \nconcluding that the Tax Court could still address wheth-\ner respondent has any \u201cunderlying tax liability\u201d\u2014an is-\nsue that may be considered under 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B) \nwhen evaluating whether a proposed levy may proceed.  \nWhen there is no proposed levy to adjudicate, the ques-\ntion of tax liability ceases to be an \u201cunderlying\u201d one.  \nNor does the Tax Court have jurisdiction to issue de-\nclaratory relief separate from its ability to enjoin the \nproposed levy that is \u201cthe subject of the requested hear-\ning.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(1). \nThat there is no longer review under Section 6330 \ndoes not foreclose judicial review of the IRS\u2019s handling \nof respondent\u2019s taxes.  Rather, as respondent has al-\nready acknowledged (Br. in Opp. 2, 4, 13, 16, 25), she \ncan proceed under the general rule and dispute the as-\nsessment and collection of her taxes in a refund suit.  \nBecause the court of appeals\u2019 contrary decision thwarts \nCongress\u2019s distinction between that general rule and \nthe narrow exception for pre-levy review, this Court \nshould reverse. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal Background \n1. The traditional mechanism for a taxpayer to dis-\npute the assessment or collection of a federal tax is a \npost-payment suit for a refund.  See CIC Servs., LLC v. \nIRS, 593 U.S. 209, 212 (2021) (\u201c[A] person can typically \nchallenge a federal tax only after he pays it, by suing for \na refund.\u201d).  To bring a refund suit, a taxpayer must first \n\n4 \n \npay the tax and then request a refund from the IRS.   \n26 U.S.C. 6402(a), 6511; 26 C.F.R. 301.6402\u20132; Flora v. \nUnited States, 357 U.S. 63, 64-75 (1958), aff\u200a\u2019d on reh\u2019g, \n362 U.S. 145 (1960).  If the refund is denied, the tax-\npayer may sue to recover the disputed amount.  28 \nU.S.C. 1346(a)(1); see 26 U.S.C. 6532, 7422(a); 28 U.S.C. \n1491(a)(1); United States v. Clintwood Elkhorn Mining \nCo., 553 U.S. 1, 4 (2008); see also, e.g., G.M. Leasing \nCorp. v. United States, 429 U.S. 338, 352 n.18 (1977) \n(collecting cases for the proposition that post-payment \nreview of a tax liability comports with due process).  \nFor certain taxes, however, Congress has also pro-\nvided a pre-assessment avenue for judicial review.  Spe-\ncifically, for income, estate, gift, and various other \ntaxes, Congress has directed the IRS to issue a \u201cnotice \nof  * * *  deficiency\u201d to a taxpayer who has failed to re-\nport a tax properly.  26 U.S.C. 6212(a).  The taxpayer \nmay then file a petition for redetermination in the Tax \nCourt.  26 U.S.C. 6213.  With certain exceptions, the \nIRS may not attempt to collect the tax at issue before \nthe time for seeking judicial review has expired or while \nsuch review is pending.  26 U.S.C. 6213(a).  \nThe Internal Revenue Code and other statutes chan-\nnel judicial review of challenges to tax assessment and \ncollection to those prescribed mechanisms.  The Tax \nAnti-Injunction Act, 26 U.S.C. 7421(a), and the tax ex-\nception to the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. \n2201(a), generally preclude suits for injunctive and de-\nclaratory relief regarding the assessment or collection \nof taxes.  And 26 U.S.C. 7422(a) precludes suits to re-\ncover taxes alleged to have been assessed or collected \nunlawfully before a taxpayer has properly sought a re-\nfund from the IRS. \n\n5 \n \n2. Following assessment, if a taxpayer who is \u201cliable \nto pay any tax neglects or refuses to pay,\u201d the IRS may \ngenerally \u201ccollect such tax\u201d by \u201clevy[ing] upon\u201d the tax-\npayer\u2019s property, i.e., seizing and selling it.  26 U.S.C. \n6331(a); see 26 U.S.C. 6331(b) (defining \u201clevy\u201d to \u201cin-\nclude[] the power of distraint and seizure by any means,\u201d \nand permitting the sale of \u201csuch property or rights to \nproperty\u201d); see also 26 U.S.C. 6321 (providing for tax \nliens).  Certain types of property\u2014including, with some \nexceptions, residences, welfare and unemployment ben-\nefits, and particular pensions\u2014are exempt from levies.  \nSee 26 U.S.C. 6334. \nBefore 1998, the Internal Revenue Code authorized \nthe IRS to levy upon taxpayer property without any \nprior opportunity for a hearing or other pre-collection \nprocess, so long as adequate post-deprivation proce-\ndures were available.  See Phillips v. Commissioner, \n283 U.S. 589, 595 (1931); 26 U.S.C. 6331(d) (1994).  In \n1998, however, Congress established procedures that \nthe IRS generally must follow before levying.  See Tax-\npayer Bill of Rights 3 (Taxpayer Bill of Rights), Pub. L. \nNo. 105-206, Tit. III, \u00a7 3401(b), 112 Stat. 747-749 (26 \nU.S.C. 6330); see also id. \u00a7 3401(a), 112 Stat. 746-747 (26 \nU.S.C. 6320) (substantially similar framework for IRS \nfiling of a notice of federal tax lien).  \nThose procedures are codified in Section 6330 of the \nCode, which is entitled \u201c[n]otice and opportunity for \nhearing before levy.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330.  Under those pro-\ncedures, \u201c[n]o levy may be made\u201d unless the IRS pro-\nvides the taxpayer with 30 days\u2019 notice and the oppor-\ntunity to request a hearing.  26 U.S.C. 6330(a)(1); see 26 \nU.S.C. 6330(a)(2) and (3).   \nIf the taxpayer makes such a request, an administra-\ntive hearing to review the proposed levy\u2014sometimes \n\n6 \n \ncalled a \u201ccollection due process hearing,\u201d Boechler, P.C. \nv. Commissioner, 596 U.S. 199, 202 (2022)\u2014is con-\nducted by an impartial officer in the Appeals Office.  26 \nU.S.C. 6330(b).  The taxpayer\u2019s request for a hearing \nsuspends \u201cthe levy actions which are the subject of the \nrequested hearing\u201d as well as the running of specified \nlimitations periods.  26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(1).   \nAt the hearing, the taxpayer may raise \u201cany relevant \nissue relating to the unpaid tax or the proposed levy,\u201d \nincluding \u201cchallenges to the appropriateness of collec-\ntion actions\u201d and \u201coffers of collection alternatives.\u201d  26 \nU.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(A)(ii) and (iii); see 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(4) \n(excluding certain issues that were previously litigated \nor qualify as frivolous).  If the taxpayer \u201cdid not receive \nany statutory notice of deficiency for [the relevant] tax \nliability or did not otherwise have an opportunity to dis-\npute such tax liability,\u201d she also may raise \u201cchallenges \nto the existence or amount of the underlying tax liabil-\nity.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B). \nAt the conclusion of a Section 6330 hearing, the  \nAppeals Office issues its \u201cdetermination,\u201d 26 U.S.C. \n6330(c)(3), which is \u201ca written notice\u201d reflecting wheth-\ner \u201ccollection by way of levy may proceed.\u201d  Lunsford v. \nCommissioner, 117 T.C. 159, 164-165 (2001).  The Ap-\npeals Office reaches its determination after considering \nstatutorily delineated factors, including whether the re-\nquirements of applicable law or administrative proce-\ndure have been met, 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(1) and (3)(A); the \nissues raised by the taxpayer, 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2) and \n(3); and \u201cwhether any proposed collection action bal-\nances the need for the efficient collection of taxes with \nthe legitimate concern of the [taxpayer] that any collec-\ntion action be no more intrusive than necessary,\u201d 26 \nU.S.C. 6330(c)(3)(C).   \n\n7 \n \nA taxpayer who is dissatisfied with a determination \nsustaining a levy may petition the United States Tax \nCourt \u201cfor review of such determination (and the Tax \nCourt shall have jurisdiction with respect to such mat-\nter).\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1).  The Tax Court\u2019s decision, \nin turn, is subject to review by a federal court of ap-\npeals.  26 U.S.C. 7482(a)(1). \n3. Although a taxpayer\u2019s request for a Section 6330 \nhearing suspends \u201cthe levy actions which are the sub-\nject of the requested hearing\u201d and certain limitations \nperiods, 26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(1), other mechanisms for tax \ncollection may proceed.  Most relevant here, when a tax-\npayer overpays the tax owed for a particular year, the \nIRS \u201cmay credit the amount of such overpayment\u201d \nagainst \u201cany liability in respect of an internal revenue \ntax on the part of the person who made the overpay-\nment\u201d instead of refunding that amount to the taxpayer.  \n26 U.S.C. 6402(a).   \nThat application of overpayment credits\u2014sometimes \nreferred to as an \u201coffset\u201d\u2014is an administrative action \ndistinct from the collection of a tax by a levy or lien on \nthe taxpayer\u2019s property.  See Belloff v. Commissioner, \n996 F.2d 607, 616 (2d Cir. 1993); Boyd v. Commissioner, \n124 T.C. 296, 300 (2005); 26 C.F.R. 301.6330\u20131(g)(2),  \nQ & A-G3.  A taxpayer may challenge the application of \ncredits through the traditional mechanism for disputing \nthe collection of a federal tax: filing a refund claim with \nthe IRS and, if necessary, a refund suit.  See 26 U.S.C. \n7422(a) and (d). \nB. The Present Controversy \n1. From 1993 to 2014, respondent was married to \nPatrick Gennardo.  Pet. App. 7a.  This case concerns the \n2010 tax year, for which respondent and Gennardo ulti-\nmately filed separate tax returns.  Ibid.  \n\n8 \n \na. In 2010 and 2011, respondent and Gennardo made \ntwo estimated tax payments, totaling $50,000, to the \nIRS for tax year 2010.  Pet. App. 8a.  First, the couple \nsubmitted an estimated tax payment of $20,000.  Ibid.  \nThe accompanying Form 1040-ES identified both of \ntheir names, but it did not indicate that they would be \nfiling separate returns, and it provided no instructions \non how to allocate the payment between them.  C.A. \nApp. 274, 314.  Second, Gennardo submitted a $30,000 \nbank check, which identified only Gennardo as the re-\nmitter.  Pet. App. 8a; see C.A. App. 274, 315.  The sub-\nject line of the accompanying cover letter identified \nboth respondent and Gennardo, but neither the check \nnor any accompanying documentation instructed the \nIRS to allocate any part of that payment to respondent.  \nC.A. App. 275, 315, 633, 638. \nb. On September 12, 2012, the couple filed separate \n(and untimely) 2010 federal income-tax returns.  Pet. \nApp. 7a; see C.A. App. 316-381.  Respondent did not claim \nany of the $50,000 in estimated tax payments on her re-\nturn, while Gennardo claimed $10,000 in estimated tax \npayments on his return.  C.A. App. 317, 331. Respond-\nent\u2019s and Gennardo\u2019s tax returns were prepared by the \nsame tax preparer.  Id. at 277. \nOn the same day that they submitted their separate \ntax returns, Gennardo made a written compromise offer \nto the IRS about his outstanding federal tax liabilities \nfor tax years 2007 through 2011.  C.A. App. 278, 382.  \nAlthough the offer covered years in which respondent \nand Gennardo had filed joint tax returns, Gennardo\u2019s  \noffer-in-compromise did not include respondent.  C.A. \nApp. 386.  Consistent with the terms of the offer and \nIRS rules governing payments related to pending of-\nfers, the IRS applied the full $50,000 in estimated tax \n\n9 \n \npayments to Gennardo\u2019s separate account.  Pet. App. \n8a; see C.A. App. 277-279, 310, 384, 466, 468, 473, 662; \nI.R.S. Notice 2006-68, 2006-31 I.R.B. 105.   \nc. In November 2012, respondent filed an amended \nreturn for the 2010 tax year showing that she owed an \nadditional $27,682.  Pet. App. 9a; see C.A. App. 279, 475, \n477.  For the first time, respondent\u2019s amended return \nalso claimed for herself the full $50,000 in estimated tax \npayments, yielding a claimed overpayment of $21,918 \nfor the 2010 tax year.  Pet. App. 9a; see C.A. App. 280, \n475.  Because the IRS had already allocated the $50,000 \nto Gennardo, it declined to apply the estimated pay-\nments to respondent\u2019s account.  C.A. App. 280.  Instead, \nthe IRS assessed the tax that respondent had reported \non her amended return, along with interest and a late-\nfiling penalty of $7020.  Ibid.   \n2. a. In 2013, the IRS sent respondent a notice and \ndemand for payment of her balance due.  C.A. App. 280.  \nRespondent failed to pay, and the IRS sent her a notice \nof its intent to levy on her property to collect the unpaid \ntaxes.  Pet. App. 70a-75a; C.A. App. 571-573.   \nRespondent invoked her right under Section 6330 to \nchallenge the proposed levy in a hearing before the Ap-\npeals Office.  Pet. App. 10a; C.A. App. 567-570.  She con-\ntended that the IRS should have applied the full $50,000 \nin estimated tax payments to her account, which would \nhave satisfied her self-reported underlying tax liability \nand resulted in a refund.  Pet. App. 10a; C.A. App. 567.   \nIn 2014, after a hearing, the Appeals Office issued a \ndetermination sustaining the IRS\u2019s proposed levy, ex-\nplaining that the estimated tax payments could not be \napplied to respondent\u2019s account because they had been \ncredited to Gennardo\u2019s account.  Pet. App. 61a-67a.  Re-\nspondent petitioned the Tax Court for review, and in \n\n10 \n \n2016, the Tax Court remanded to the Appeals Office for \nclarification of several issues.  C.A. App. 16; Pet. App. \n50a-60a.  On remand, the Appeals Office reaffirmed its \nprior determination to sustain the proposed levy, ex-\nplaining in a 2017 supplemental notice of determination \nthat the estimated tax payments had been properly al-\nlocated to Gennardo.  Pet. App. 44a-49a. \nb. While respondent\u2019s pre-levy proceedings were \npending before the Appeals Office and the Tax Court, \nrespondent overpaid her taxes for 2013 and subsequent \ntax years.  Pet. App. 12a-13a.  The IRS exercised its au-\nthority under Section 6402(a) to credit her overpay-\nments in those years against her 2010 tax liability.  Ibid.  \nBy April 15, 2019, the credits transferred from later tax \nyears had reduced the balance due on respondent\u2019s 2010 \nliability to $0.  Id. at 13a. \nIn March 2020, the IRS moved to dismiss as moot the \npre-levy proceeding before the Tax Court, explaining \nthat respondent\u2019s 2010 tax liability had been satisfied \nand the IRS therefore \u201cno longer intend[ed] to pursue \nthe proposed collection action.\u201d  Pet. App. 42a; see C.A. \nDoc. 5-4, at 450 (July 21, 2022) (motion to dismiss).   \nThe Tax Court granted the motion and dismissed the \ncase.  Pet. App. 40a-43a.  The court explained that the \n\u201ccase is moot\u201d \u201c[b]ecause there is no unpaid liability for \nthe determination year upon which a levy could be \nbased, and [the IRS] is no longer pursuing the proposed \ncollection action.\u201d  Id. at 43a (citing McLane v. Commis-\nsioner, 24 F.4th 316 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 143 S. Ct. \n408 (2022); Greene-Thapedi v. Commissioner, 126 T.C. \n1, 7 (2006)).  The court acknowledged that respondent \ncontinued to argue that the IRS should have credited \nthe estimated payments to her, but the court reasoned \nthat because it did not \u201chave jurisdiction to determine \n\n11 \n \nan overpayment or to order a refund or credit of tax \npaid in a section 6330 proceeding, this is not the proper \nforum to determine whether, and the extent to which, if \nany, the underlying liability has been overpaid.\u201d  Ibid.  \nThe court observed that respondent could still \u201cpursue \nany refund to which she might be entitled through tra-\nditional Federal income procedures, including if neces-\nsary, initiating a case in a different Federal court.\u201d  \nIbid. \n3. The court of appeals vacated the Tax Court\u2019s or-\nder of dismissal and remanded for the Tax Court to de-\ntermine whether respondent was entitled to the esti-\nmated tax payments that the IRS had allocated to Gen-\nnardo.  Pet. App. 1a-39a.   \nAlthough the court of appeals acknowledged that \n\u201cthe Tax Court need not hear a moot case,\u201d Pet. App. \n16a, the court of appeals held that the proceedings be-\nfore the Tax Court are \u201cnot moot,\u201d id. at 2a.  In a part \nof the opinion joined by only two members of the panel, \nthe court of appeals concluded that the Tax Court has \njurisdiction in a Section 6330 pre-levy proceeding to re-\nview a taxpayer\u2019s \u201cunderlying tax liability,\u201d id. at 26a \n(quoting 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B)), and that the statute \ndoes not \u201csuggest that a taxpayer\u2019s right to challenge \nthe existence or amount of her underlying tax becomes \nmoot once the levy is no longer being enforced or the \ntax is satisfied,\u201d id. at 26a-27a.  The court of appeals \nreasoned that even though the IRS is no longer seeking \nto take respondent\u2019s property by levy, the Tax Court \nretains jurisdiction to \u201cdeclare that [respondent] had a \nright to the estimated payments.\u201d  Id. at 37a.  The court \nof appeals acknowledged that its holding is contrary to \nthose of the Fourth and D.C. Circuits, which have held \nthat a Section 6330 proceeding in the Tax Court is moot \n\n12 \n \nwhen the IRS no longer seeks to levy on a taxpayer\u2019s \nproperty.  Id. at 27a (citing McLane, 24 F.4th at 319 (4th \nCir.); Willson v. Commissioner, 805 F.3d 316, 321 (D.C. \nCir. 2015)).   \nIn a part of the opinion joined by all three members \nof the panel, the court of appeals alternatively con-\ncluded that the case is not moot on the theory that the \nTax Court has jurisdiction to determine whether the \nIRS validly exercised its authority under Section 6402 \nto use respondent\u2019s later-year overpayments to offset \nher 2010 tax liability.  Pet. App. 19a-25a.  Respondent \nhad made only a passing reference to the validity of the \noffsets in her reply brief, see Resp. C.A. Reply Br. 16-\n17, but after oral argument, the court of appeals ap-\npointed an amicus to address the question (along with \nsix other issues), C.A. Doc. 45 (June 1, 2023).   \nIn holding that the Tax Court may review the appli-\ncation of credits under Section 6402, the court of ap-\npeals relied on \u201can implicit grant\u201d of jurisdiction, ob-\nserving that \u201c[i]t may be that Congress has not explic-\nitly granted the Tax Court such power.\u201d  Pet. App. 20a.  \nSpecifically, the court of appeals reasoned that Section \n6402 \u201ccarries forward the common law of setoffs,\u201d which \nmeans that the Tax Court has implicit jurisdiction to re-\nview the application of credits in a pre-levy proceeding, \neven absent a proposed levy.  Id. at 21a.1   \nThe court of appeals then considered the application \nof Section 6402 credits to respondent\u2019s 2010 tax liability \nin the first instance.  Even though Section 6402 allows \n \n1  Although the court of appeals used the terms \u201coffset\u201d and \u201cset-\noff\u200a\u201d interchangeably, the statute uses \u201coffset\u201d to refer to an over-\npayment credit, see 26 U.S.C. 6402, while \u201csetoff\u200a\u201d is typically used \nto describe the common-law principle, see, e.g., United States v. \nMunsey Trust Co., 332 U.S. 234, 239 (1947). \n\n13 \n \nthe application of credits to \u201cany liability,\u201d 26 U.S.C. \n6402(a), the court determined that the offset was \u201cinva-\nlid and without legal effect\u201d because common-law setoff \nprinciples do not apply to disputed debts, Pet. App. 25a.  \nHaving concluded that respondent\u2019s \u201ctax obligation was \nnot properly set off,\u201d the court determined that her tax \nliability remains, and she may \u201cchallenge the IRS\u2019s ap-\nplication of the estimated payments\u201d in a Section 6330 \nproceeding.  Id. at 19a.   \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nA pre-levy proceeding under 26 U.S.C. 6330 is moot \nwhen there is no longer a live dispute over the proposed \nlevy that gave rise to the proceeding. \nA. The Tax Court is a court of limited jurisdiction, \ncapable of exercising only the jurisdiction expressly \nconferred on it by Congress.  The Tax Court has been \ngranted jurisdiction over a \u201cpetition  * * *  for review\u201d \nof the Appeals Office\u2019s \u201cdetermination\u201d whether a par-\nticular levy may proceed.  26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1).  When \nthe IRS no longer seeks to proceed by levy\u2014such that \nthere is no live dispute over \u201cthe levy action[] which  \n[is] the subject of the requested hearing,\u201d 26 U.S.C. \n6330(e)(1)\u2014the taxpayer\u2019s challenge is moot, and the \nTax Court lacks jurisdiction to resolve it. \nAt every step in the Section 6330 process, the statu-\ntory text squarely focuses on the question whether a \nlevy may go forward.  The statute mandates that the \ntaxpayer receive notice and an opportunity for a hear-\ning \u201cbefore levy\u201d; it requires that certain levy-related \ninformation be conveyed in the notice; and it instructs \nthat the Appeals Office\u2019s \u201cdetermination\u201d must \u201ctake \ninto consideration,\u201d inter alia, \u201cwhether any proposed \ncollection action balances the need for the efficient col-\nlection of taxes with the legitimate concern of the per-\n\n14 \n \nson that any collection action be no more intrusive than \nnecessary.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(a) and (c)(3)(C).  Once the \nAppeals Office determines whether the levy may pro-\nceed, Section 6330 authorizes the Tax Court to review \n\u201csuch determination.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1).  But where \nthere is no longer a live dispute over a levy, there is \nnothing left for the Tax Court to do, and the case is \nmoot. \nB. That understanding is consistent with Section \n6330\u2019s history and its role in the Internal Revenue Code.  \nCongress enacted Section 6330 to ensure that taxpayers \nhave a pre-deprivation opportunity to contest levies.  \nSection 6330 was not designed to, and did not, provide a \nbroader means for taxpayers to dispute their tax liabil-\nity untethered from proposed levies. \nC. The court of appeals\u2019 and respondent\u2019s contrary \narguments lack merit.  Both the court and respondent \nhave suggested that the Tax Court retains jurisdiction \nabsent a live dispute over a levy because, in some cir-\ncumstances, Section 6330(c)(2)(B) permits a taxpayer to \nraise at a pre-levy hearing \u201cchallenges to the existence \nor amount of the underlying tax liability.\u201d  26 U.S.C. \n6330(c)(2)(B); see Pet. App. 19a; Br. in Opp. 14.  But, as \nthat text underscores, a taxpayer\u2019s \u201cunderlying tax lia-\nbility\u201d must underlie the proposed collection action\u2014\nthat is, the levy.  The statute thus does not support treat-\ning a taxpayer\u2019s challenge to her \u201cunderlying tax liabil-\nity\u201d as providing a freestanding basis for Tax Court ju-\nrisdiction.  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B).  Rather, where Sec-\ntion 6330(c)(2)(B) applies, it simply supplies one \u201ccon-\nsideration\u201d that the Appeals Office must \u201ctake into\u201d ac-\ncount when issuing the \u201cdetermination\u201d whether the \nproposed levy may proceed.  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B) and \n(3).  When there is no live dispute over a proposed levy, \n\n15 \n \nthere is no Tax Court jurisdiction to address the \u201cun-\nderlying\u201d question.  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B). \nThe court of appeals alternatively held that the Tax \nCourt has \u201cimplicit\u201d jurisdiction to review the IRS\u2019s al-\nlocation of respondent\u2019s later-year overpayments to off-\nset her tax liability.  Pet. App. 20a.  Respondent has not \ndefended that rationale in this Court, and for good rea-\nson.  Congress must expressly provide for Tax Court \njurisdiction by statute, and no statute grants that court \nauthority to review Section 6402 credits in a Section \n6330 proceeding.  Even if the Tax Court could conduct \nsuch review, it still could not provide meaningful relief. \nD. This case is moot.  When respondent failed to pay \nher self-reported 2010 tax debt, the IRS proposed to \ncollect her liability by administrative levy.  Respondent \nthen invoked her right to a pre-levy proceeding under \nSection 6330.  But while that proceeding was ongoing, \nrespondent overpaid her taxes for subsequent tax \nyears, and the IRS used its authority under Section \n6402 to credit those overpayments against respondent\u2019s \n2010 tax debt.  With no debt remaining, the IRS aban-\ndoned the levy that was \u201cthe subject of the requested \nhearing,\u201d 26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(1).  The Tax Court therefore \nlacked jurisdiction to review the Appeals Office\u2019s \u201cde-\ntermination\u201d that the levy could proceed.  26 U.S.C. \n6330(d)(1).   \nThat does not, however, leave respondent without a \njudicial remedy:  She may dispute the IRS\u2019s allocation \nof the 2010 estimated payments and her subsequent \noverpayments in a refund suit, the traditional mecha-\nnism for such challenges (and the one that she could \nhave used if the IRS had never proposed a levy).  But \nabsent a live dispute over a potential levy, Section 6330 \nhas no role to play. \n\n16 \n \nARGUMENT \nA PRE-LEVY PROCEEDING UNDER 26 U.S.C. 6330 IS MOOT \nWHEN THERE IS NO LONGER A LIVE DISPUTE OVER THE \nPROPOSED LEVY THAT GAVE RISE TO THE PROCEEDING \nThe court of appeals held that a pre-levy proceeding \nunder 26 U.S.C. 6330 may continue even when there is \nno longer a live dispute over the proposed levy that gave \nrise to the proceeding.  Pet. App. 16a-39a.  That holding \nis incorrect.  Section 6330 is narrowly trained on the ap-\npropriateness of a proposed levy.  When the parties no \nlonger dispute the propriety of such a levy, the proceed-\ning becomes moot.  This Court should reverse. \nA. The Text Of Section 6330 Makes Clear That A Pre-Levy \nProceeding Is Moot When The IRS No Longer Seeks To \nLevy On A Taxpayer\u2019s Property \n1. The United States Tax Court is \u201ca court of limited \njurisdiction.\u201d  Commissioner v. McCoy, 484 U.S. 3, 7 (1987) \n(per curiam).  It may exercise \u201conly the power \u2018expressly \nconferred by Congress.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. 14a (quoting Sunoco \nInc. v. Commissioner, 663 F.3d 181, 187 (3d Cir. 2011)); \nsee 26 U.S.C. 7442; see, e.g., Commissioner v. Gooch \nMilling & Elevator Co., 320 U.S. 418, 422 (1943) (dis-\ncussing the Tax Court\u2019s predecessor, the Board of Tax \nAppeals).  \u201cThus, if a case raises a question within the \njurisdictional purview of the tax court, and that ques-\ntion is subsequently resolved, the case is moot\u201d\u2014and \nthe Tax Court lacks jurisdiction\u2014\u201cnotwithstanding the \nexistence of other live controversies between the tax-\npayer and the IRS that do not fall within the tax court\u2019s \njurisdiction.\u201d  Willson v. Commissioner, 805 F.3d 316, \n320 (D.C. Cir. 2015). \nHere, it is undisputed that the relevant jurisdiction-\nconferring provision is 26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1).  See Pet. 8; \nBr. in Opp. 14; see also Pet. App. 14a.  Section 6330 pro-\n\n17 \n \nvides a mechanism for \u201cthe taxpayer [to] challenge [a] \nlevy or offer collection alternatives\u201d before a seizure of \nthe taxpayer\u2019s property occurs.  Boechler, P.C. v. Com-\nmissioner, 596 U.S. 199, 202 (2022).  That procedure\u2014\nalong with the similar one for tax liens, 26 U.S.C. 6320\u2014\nis only necessary when the IRS is attempting to use a \nlien or levy to enforce collection of a tax liability.  If the \nIRS\u2019s Appeals Office issues a \u201cdetermination\u201d that the \nproposed levy may proceed, Section 6330(d)(1) grants \nthe Tax Court \u201cjurisdiction\u201d over the taxpayer\u2019s peti-\ntion for review of \u201csuch determination.\u201d  26 U.S.C. \n6330(d)(1); see 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3).   \nThe entire point of the Section 6330 proceeding is to \ndetermine whether the IRS may go forward with its \nproposed levy.  Thus, at every step, the statutory text is \nnarrowly focused on that question.  Congress supplied \nthe title for the section:  \u201cNotice and opportunity for \nhearing before levy.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330; Taxpayer Bill of \nRights \u00a7 3401(b), 112 Stat. 747.  Section 6330(a)(1) di-\nrectly ties the right to a hearing to the proposed levy, \nproviding that \u201c[n]o levy may be made on any property \nor right to property of any person unless the Secretary \nhas notified such person in writing of their right to a \nhearing under this section before such levy is made.\u201d  26 \nU.S.C. 6330(a)(1); see Greene-Thapedi v. Commissioner, \n126 T.C. 1, 6, 8 (2006).  Notice of the proposed levy must \nbe given \u201cnot less than 30 days before the day of the \nfirst levy,\u201d and it must include a variety of levy-related \ninformation, including \u201cthe proposed action\u201d; \u201cthe pro-\nvisions of [Title 26] relating to levy and sale of prop-\nerty\u201d; \u201cthe procedures applicable to the levy and sale of \nproperty under [Title 26]\u201d; \u201cthe administrative appeals \navailable to the taxpayer with respect to such levy and \nsale\u201d; \u201cthe alternatives available to taxpayers which \n\n18 \n \ncould prevent levy on property\u201d; and \u201cthe provisions of \n[Title 26] and procedures relating to redemption of \nproperty and release of liens on property.\u201d  26 U.S.C. \n6330(a)(2) and (3)(C).  The exceptions to Section 6330 \nalso reflect its focus on levies.  The pre-levy procedure \nis unavailable if the Secretary finds that \u201cthe collection \nof tax is in jeopardy,\u201d or if the case concerns certain lev-\nies imposed on States, \u201cdisqualified employment tax \nlev[ies],\u201d or \u201cFederal contractor lev[ies].\u201d  26 U.S.C. \n6330(f\u200a).  In those instances, \u201cthe taxpayer shall be given \nthe opportunity for the hearing described in [Section \n6330] within a reasonable period of time after the levy.\u201d  \nIbid.   \nIf no exception applies and the taxpayer invokes her \nstatutory right to a pre-levy hearing, \u201cthe levy actions \nwhich are the subject of the requested hearing\u201d and cer-\ntain limitations periods \u201cshall be suspended for the pe-\nriod during which such hearing, and appeals therein, are \npending.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(1); see 26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(2) \n(providing an exception to this rule).  Because the levy \nis the \u201csubject of the requested hearing,\u201d ibid., it would \nmake little sense for the action to continue once the IRS \nno longer seeks to enforce the levy.  \nThe outcome of the \u201cCollection Due Process\u201d or \n\u201cCDP hearing\u201d under Section 6330 is a \u201c\u200a\u2018determination\u2019 \nregarding the legitimacy of the proposed levy.\u201d  Will-\nson, 805 F.3d 318, 320 (quoting 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3)); \nsee McLane v. Commissioner, 24 F.4th 316, 318-319 \n(4th Cir.), cert. denied, 143 S. Ct. 408 (2022) (explaining \nthat \u201cthe Appeals Office determines in the first instance \nwhether the IRS\u2019s collection action may go forward\u201d).  \nAt the hearing, the taxpayer may raise \u201cany relevant \nissue relating to the unpaid tax or the proposed levy,\u201d \nincluding \u201cappropriate spousal defenses,\u201d \u201cchallenges to \n\n19 \n \nthe appropriateness of collection actions,\u201d and \u201coffers of \ncollection alternatives.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(A).  The \nAppeals Office\u2019s \u201c\u200adetermination,\u201d in turn, \u201cshall take \ninto consideration  * * *  whether any proposed collec-\ntion action balances the need for the efficient collection \nof taxes with the legitimate concern of the person that \nany collection action be no more intrusive than neces-\nsary.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3)(C).   \nIn certain cases where the taxpayer has not previ-\nously had the opportunity to dispute her tax liability, \nthe taxpayer may also raise \u201cchallenges to the existence \nor amount of the underlying tax liability.\u201d  26 U.S.C. \n6330(c)(2)(B).  But like the other issues that the tax-\npayer may raise, such challenges to the taxpayer\u2019s un-\nderlying liability are simply \u201cconsideration[s]\u201d that feed \ninto the ultimate \u201cdetermination\u201d whether the levy may \nproceed.  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3)(C).   \nIn this case, for example, the Notice of Determina-\ntion that the Appeals Office sent respondent recounted \nthe Appeals Office\u2019s \u201cdetermination  * * *  that the pro-\nposed levy  * * *  balances the need for efficient collec-\ntion of taxes with [respondent\u2019s] legitimate concern that \nany collection action be no more intrusive than neces-\nsary.\u201d  Pet. App. 63a.  And it stated that \u201cthe Final No-\ntice of [I]ntent to Levy [was therefore] being sus-\ntained.\u201d  Ibid.; see id. at 64a (\u201cAppeals has determined \nto sustain the action (levy).\u201d). \n2. The statutory focus on the appropriateness of a \nproposed levy follows the case to the Tax Court.  Section \n6330(d)(1) provides that \u201cwithin 30 days of a determina-\ntion under this section\u201d\u2014that is, a determination \nwhether the levy may go forward\u2014the taxpayer may \n\u201cpetition the Tax Court for review of such determina-\ntion.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1).  And crucially, the statute \n\n20 \n \nvests the Tax Court with \u201cjurisdiction with respect to \nsuch matter,\u201d ibid.\u2014i.e., the \u201cpetition for review of [the \nAppeals Office\u2019s] determination.\u201d  Boechler, 596 U.S. at \n204; see, e.g., Lunsford v. Commissioner, 117 T.C. 159, \n164 (2001) (explaining that the Tax Court\u2019s \u201cjurisdiction  \n* * *  is established when there is a written notice that \nembodies a determination to proceed with the collection \nof the taxes in issue, and a timely filed petition\u201d there-\nfrom).  Thus, the Tax Court proceedings\u2014like the ear-\nlier Appeals Office proceedings\u2014are squarely focused \non whether the IRS may enforce a proposed levy. \n3. Once the IRS has determined that it is no longer \nseeking to levy on the taxpayer\u2019s property, there is \nnothing left for the Tax Court to do.  Such a decision not \nto pursue a levy is \u201cthe very relief [the taxpayer] osten-\nsibly sought when [she] requested a [Section 6330] \nhearing to challenge the proposed levy in the first \nplace,\u201d and it is \u201call the relief that section 6330 author-\nizes the tax court to grant.\u201d  Willson, 805 F.3d at 321.  \nSection 6330(e)(1) provides that if a taxpayer requests \na hearing, \u201cthe levy actions which are the subject of the \nrequested hearing  * * *  shall be suspended\u201d during the \npendency of the hearing and any appeals.  26 U.S.C. \n6330(e)(1).  The statute further states that \u201c[n]otwith-\nstanding the provisions of section 7421(a)\u201d\u2014the Tax \nAnti-Injunction Act\u2014\u201cthe beginning of a levy or pro-\nceeding during\u201d that period of suspension \u201cmay be en-\njoined by a proceeding in the proper court, including the \nTax Court\u201d if an appeal to the Tax Court is timely filed.  \nIbid.  But the timely appeal triggers Tax Court jurisdic-\ntion to enjoin other actions \u201conly in respect of the un-\npaid tax or proposed levy to which the determination \nbeing appealed relates.\u201d  Ibid.  And that power ceases \nto matter when the IRS has already decided not to pur-\n\n21 \n \nsue the proposed levy because it is satisfied that the tax \nhas been paid. \nThus, when the IRS determines that it no longer \nneeds or intends to take the taxpayer\u2019s property by \nlevy, the pre-levy proceeding becomes moot.  That is \ntrue whether the liability has been \u201cabated,\u201d see Will-\nson, 805 F.3d at 320 (IRS ceased pursuing levy based on \nincorrect assessment); Byers v. Commissioner, 740 \nF.3d 668, 679 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (similar); or has been sat-\nisfied with other taxpayer funds, see McLane, 24 F.4th \nat 319; Greene-Thapedi, 126 T.C. at 7.   \nAnd the proceeding remains moot regardless of \nwhether the taxpayer contends that the IRS has made \nan error or continues to owe her money.  See Willson, \n805 F.3d at 320; McLane, 24 F.4th at 319 n.*; Greene-\nThapedi, 126 T.C. at 7.  The taxpayer may make those \narguments in a post-deprivation suit for a refund\u2014the \ntraditional mechanism for disputing the assessment or \ncollection of a federal tax.  See 26 U.S.C. 7422(a); 28 \nU.S.C. 1346(a)(1), 1491(a)(1).  But the Section 6330 pro-\nceeding is a rare pre-deprivation mechanism for chal-\nlenging a particular method of a collection: a proposed \nlevy.  Once the IRS no longer seeks to deprive the tax-\npayer of any property by levy, the issue that prompted \nthe Section 6330 proceeding is no longer \u201c\u200a\u2018live,\u2019\u200a\u201d and the \nparties have ceased to have any \u201clegally cognizable in-\nterest\u201d in a determination regarding the permissibility \nof the levy.  Chafin v. Chafin, 568 U.S. 165, 172 (2013) \n(citation omitted).2   \n \n2 Although it is not organized under Article III, the Tax Court has \nconcluded that \u201c[t]he case or controversy requirement under Article \nIII \u2018presumptively\u2019 applies in the Tax Court.\u201d  Pet. App. 15a (quot-\ning Battat v. Commissioner, 148 T.C. 32, 46 (2017)).  This Court \nneed not determine whether the Tax Court\u2019s understanding is cor-\n\n22 \n \nB. Section 6330\u2019s History And Function Within The Inter-\nnal Revenue Code Confirm That A Pre-levy Proceeding \nBecomes Moot When There Is No Longer A Live Dispute \nOver A Proposed Levy  \n1. As discussed above, the default means for a tax-\npayer to dispute the assessment or collection of a federal \ntax is a post-payment refund suit.  See pp. 3-4, supra.  Be-\nfore 1998, the Internal Revenue Code authorized the \nIRS to levy upon taxpayer property without any prior \nopportunity for a hearing or other pre-collection pro-\ncess, so long as the taxpayer was given 30 days\u2019 notice.  \nSee 26 U.S.C. 6331(d) (1994); see, e.g., Iames v. Com-\nmissioner, 850 F.3d 160, 165 (4th Cir. 2017) (describing \n\u201cthe Commissioner\u2019s significant and previously unfet-\ntered power to levy\u201d).   \nThat changed in 1998, when Congress enacted \u201ca \nprocedural protection for taxpayers to oppose IRS col-\nlection actions\u201d before they occurred.  Jeffers v. Com-\nmissioner, 992 F.3d 649, 655 (7th Cir. 2021).  In making \nthat change, Congress\u2019s \u201cgeneral focus\u201d was \u201con the \nCommissioner\u2019s collection of a predetermined liability.\u201d  \n \nrect.  Regardless of whether Article III constraints apply, \u201cthe con-\ntroversy must also fall within the [Tax Court\u2019s] statutory grant of \njurisdiction.\u201d  Willson, 805 F.3d at 320.  And once the IRS has de-\ntermined that it will not pursue a levy, the Tax Court lacks statutory \njurisdiction over a Section 6330 proceeding.  This Court may resolve \nthe question presented on that basis.  See Sinochem Int\u2019l Co. v. Ma-\nlaysia Int\u2019l Shipping Corp., 549 U.S. 422, 430-431 (2007).    \n In any event, assuming that Article III principles do apply, the \ncase is moot.  Respondent has no live interest in contesting a with-\ndrawn levy, and the only relief that the Tax Court could provide\u2014a \ndetermination that the levy could not go forward, and an injunction \nagainst it\u2014would not constitute \u201ceffectual relief,\u201d Campbell-Ewald \nCo. v. Gomez, 577 U.S. 153, 161 (2016) (citation omitted), after the \nproposed levy has already been withdrawn.   \n\n23 \n \nIames, 850 F.3d at 165.  That is, Congress designed Sec-\ntion 6330 to review a proposed levy, not to provide a \nmore general opportunity for a taxpayer to challenge an \nassessment of tax. \nThe pre-levy procedures in Section 6330 were under-\nstood as \u201cestablish[ing] formal procedures designed to \ninsure due process where the IRS seeks to collect taxes \nby levy.\u201d  S. Rep. No. 174, 105th Cong., 2d Sess. 67 (1998); \nsee ibid. (\u201c[T]he Committee believes that the IRS \nshould afford taxpayers adequate notice of collection ac-\ntivity and a meaningful hearing before the IRS deprives \nthem of their property.\u201d); see also H.R. Rep. No. 599, \n105th Cong., 2d Sess. 263 (1998) (describing the new \nprovision in similar terms).  \u201c[T]he entire purpose be-\nhind the creation of [Section 6330] was to provide tax-\npayers with greater due process to contest the IRS\u2019s \nlevy and sale of their property.\u201d  Zapara v. Commis-\nsioner, 652 F.3d 1042, 1045 (9th Cir. 2011).  Nothing in \nthe history of the provision suggests that Congress in-\ntended for the pre-levy proceeding to continue where \nthere is no longer a live dispute over a proposed levy. \n2. That understanding of Section 6330 is consistent \nwith its important but limited function within the Inter-\nnal Revenue Code.  Challenges to the assessment of a \ntax are generally the province of post-payment refund \nsuits, and in the case of certain taxes, pre-payment de-\nficiency actions.  See pp. 3-4, supra.  The Internal Rev-\nenue Code and other statutes protect that principle \nthrough provisions like the Tax Anti-Injunction Act, 26 \nU.S.C. 7421(a), and the tax exception to the Declaratory \nJudgment Act, 28 U.S.C. 2201(a), which generally pre-\nclude suits for injunctive and declaratory relief regard-\ning the assessment or collection of taxes.  Understood \nagainst that backdrop, Section 6330 is a limited mecha-\n\n24 \n \nnism to ensure that a taxpayer may \u201cchallenge a levy \nbefore seizure and sale,\u201d Pet. App. 4a\u2014not an addi-\ntional avenue to seek relief in the absence of a live dis-\npute over a levy.   \nThere are tens of thousands of Section 6330 proceed-\nings each year.  See Treasury Inspector Gen. for Tax \nAdmin., U.S. Dep\u2019t of the Treasury, Report No. 2023-\n10-038, Review of the IRS Independent Office of Ap-\npeals Collection Due Process Program 7 (July 2023), \nperma.cc/DVL7-9HA8 (reporting 28,349 closed Section \n6330 cases in 2023).  Allowing those proceedings to con-\ntinue even when the IRS no longer seeks to levy on a \ntaxpayer\u2019s property could convert many of them from a \nlimited opportunity for pre-deprivation review into a \nmore general forum for considering challenges to tax li-\nability.  Nothing in the text or history of Section 6330 \nsupports that end-run around the calibrated statutory \nframework that generally provides for post-payment \nadjudication of disputes over tax liability. \nC. The Contrary Arguments Offered By Respondent And \nThe Court Of Appeals Lack Merit \nThe court of appeals recognized that \u201cthe Tax Court \nneed not hear a moot case.\u201d  Pet. App. 16a.  But the \ncourt held that a pre-levy proceeding under Section \n6330 does not become moot when the IRS \u201cwithdr[aws] \nits levy.\u201d  Id. at 25a.  That was error, and neither the \ncourt of appeals nor respondent has offered any persua-\nsive support for the court\u2019s holding. \n1. The Tax Court lacks jurisdiction to consider a tax-\npayer\u2019s \u201cunderlying tax liability\u201d when there is no \nlive dispute over a proposed levy \na. In a portion of its opinion joined by only two mem-\nbers of the panel, the court of appeals held that the Sec-\n\n25 \n \ntion 6330 proceeding in this case is not moot because re-\nspondent still disputes whether the IRS \u201cerroneously \nallocated\u201d the estimated payments to Gennardo rather \nthan respondent.  Pet. App. 19a.  The court relied on \nSection 6330(c)(2)(B), which, in certain circumstances, \nallows a taxpayer to raise at a Section 6330 hearing \u201cthe \nexistence or amount of the underlying tax liability.\u201d  26 \nU.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B).  Respondent likewise contends \n(Br. in Opp. 14) that the Tax Court may \u201cresolve any \ndispute about the taxpayer\u2019s underlying tax liability \nthat the taxpayer properly raised before the Appeals \nOffice\u201d\u2014even if the IRS no longer seeks to enforce the \nlevy that gave rise to the Section 6330 proceeding.3 \nThat argument ignores the text and context of Sec-\ntion 6330(c)(2)(B).  That provision comes into play \n \n3 The parties have disagreed about which subsection of Section \n6330 governs respondent\u2019s challenge to the IRS\u2019s allocation of  \nestimated payments.  See Pet. Reply Br. 4 n.2.  While respondent \nrelies on Section 6330(c)(2)(B)\u2019s reference to \u201cchallenges to the ex-\nistence or amount of the underlying tax liability,\u201d id. at 4, the gov-\nernment disputes that characterization because the liability  \nitself\u2014respondent\u2019s self-reported 2010 tax\u2014is not in question.  \nSee Gov\u2019t C.A. Supp. Br. 24-25.  Because respondent claims that the \nagreed-upon liability should have been paid through the estimated \npayments, the government views that argument as an \u201cissue relat-\ning to the unpaid tax.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(A); see Melasky v. Com-\nmissioner, 151 T.C. 89, 92 (2018) (\u201cA question about whether the \nIRS properly credited a payment is not a challenge to a tax liability; \ni.e., the amount of tax imposed by the Code for a particular year.  It \nis instead a question of whether the liability remains unpaid.\u201d).  The \nCourt need not, however, decide this dispute to resolve the question \npresented.  As discussed in the text, even under respondent\u2019s char-\nacterization, the Section 6330 proceeding in this case is moot be-\ncause a taxpayer may challenge her \u201cunderlying tax liability\u201d only \nin connection with a determination whether a proposed levy may \nproceed. \n\n26 \n \nwhere the taxpayer seeks to dispute an \u201cunderlying tax \nliability.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B).  For a \u201cliability\u201d to \nexist, the taxpayer must still owe a debt to the IRS.  See \nWebster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary of the \nEnglish Language 1302 (1993) (Webster\u2019s Third) (defin-\ning \u201cliability\u201d as \u201can amount that is owed whether pay-\nable in money, other property, or services\u201d); see also \nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary 1095 (12th ed. 2024) (defining \n\u201cliability\u201d as \u201c[a] financial or pecuniary obligation in a \nspecificed amount; DEBT <tax liability>\u201d).   \nCrucially, for a taxpayer\u2019s liability to be \u201cunderly-\ning,\u201d it must be \u201clying under or beneath,\u201d \u201cbe at the ba-\nsis of,\u201d or \u201cform the foundation of\u200a\u201d something else.  \nWebster\u2019s Third 2489 (definitions of \u201cunderlying\u201d and \n\u201cunderlie\u201d).  In the context of Section 6330, the tax lia-\nbility is \u201cunderlying\u201d the proposed \u201clevy actions which \nare the subject of the requested hearing.\u201d  26 U.S.C. \n6330(c)(2)(B) and (e)(1).  When there is not a proposed \nlevy, any dispute about tax liability ceases to be the \nfoundation for something else.  There is accordingly no \n\u201cunderlying tax liability\u201d for purposes of 26 U.S.C. \n6330(c)(2)(B). \nAs the Fourth Circuit has correctly explained, the \nphrase \u201cunderlying tax liability\u201d must be understood in \n\u201cthe specific context in which that language is used,\u201d \nand in Section 6330, \u201cthe \u2018specific context\u2019 is the IRS\u2019s \nattempt to collect via lien or levy.\u201d  McLane, 24 F.4th at \n319 (quoting Yates v. United States, 574 U.S. 528, 537 \n(2015)).  Where Section 6330(c)(2)(B) applies, a tax-\npayer may challenge the existence or amount of her \n\u201cunderlying tax liability,\u201d 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B)\u2014just \nas she may raise \u201cany relevant issue relating to the un-\npaid tax,\u201d 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(A).  But those challenges \nare available for purposes of informing the determina-\n\n27 \n \ntion whether the proposed levy may proceed.  The stat-\nute therefore requires the Appeals Office to \u201ctake\u201d \nthose factors \u201cinto consideration\u201d in making its \u201cdeter-\nmination\u201d about the levy.  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3).  And the \nTax Court will in turn review \u201csuch determination\u201d on \nappeal.  26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1).  If the Tax Court con-\ncludes that a taxpayer owes less than the IRS has cal-\nculated, that conclusion will affect the propriety of the \nproposed collection action because the IRS cannot col-\nlect more than is owed.    \nBut that is the extent of the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction \nunder Section 6330.  Section 6330 does not identify a \nchallenge to the taxpayer\u2019s \u201cunderlying tax liability\u201d as \na freestanding issue.  When the IRS is not seeking a levy, \nthere is no underlying liability, and Section 6330(c)(2)(B) \nhas no role to play.  In that instance, the taxpayer can-\nnot use a Section 6330 proceeding as an \u201cindependent \nbasis to challenge the existence or amount\u201d of her tax \ndebt, Greene-Thapedi, 126 T.C. at 8\u2014just as she could \nnot have used Section 6330 to seek such findings if no \nlevy had been proposed in the first place.  See McLane, \n24 F.4th at 319; Willson, 805 F.3d at 320-321; Byers, 740 \nF.3d at 679.   \nb. Echoing the court of appeals (Pet. App. 33a-36a), \nrespondent has suggested (Br. in Opp. 19) that her case \nis not moot because the Tax Court \u201chad authority to is-\nsue declaratory relief as to [her] underlying liability.\u201d  \nBut even where declaratory relief is generally available, \nit \u201cdoes not \u2018extend\u2019 the \u2018jurisdiction\u2019 of the federal \ncourts.\u201d  Medtronic, Inc. v. Mirowski Family Ventures, \nLLC, 571 U.S. 191, 197 (2014) (quoting Skelly Oil Co. v. \nPhillips Petroleum Co., 339 U.S. 667, 671 (1950)).  And \nhere, the Tax Court lacks the authority to provide the \ndeclaration that respondent seeks. \n\n28 \n \nCongress has granted only limited powers of declar-\natory relief with respect to federal taxes.  The Declara-\ntory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. 2201(a), bars declaratory \njudgments \u201cwith respect to Federal taxes other than ac-\ntions brought under section 7428 of the Internal Reve-\nnue Code of 1986.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2201(a); see ibid. (excluding \ncertain bankruptcy and duty-related proceedings).  Sec-\ntion 7428 grants authority to issue declaratory judgments, \nbut only with respect to tax-exempt status.  26 U.S.C. \n7428(a)(1) and (2).  Congress has also authorized the Tax \nCourt to issue declaratory relief in certain other con-\ntexts.  See 26 U.S.C. 7476-7479.  But none of those pro-\nvisions authorizes the Tax Court to issue declaratory \njudgments in a levy-review proceeding under Section \n6330.   \nRespondent contends (Br. in Opp. 23) that because \nSection 6330(e)(1) \u201cauthorizes\u201d the Tax Court to order \n\u201cinjunctive relief,\u201d it \u201cnecessarily * * *  authorizes de-\nclaratory relief\u200a\u201d as well.  See Pet. App. 35a-36a.  But \nrespondent\u2019s reasoning fails on its own terms.  Where \nthe IRS no longer seeks to enforce a levy, the court has \nno power to enjoin a levy under Section 6330(e).  See, \ne.g., Willson, 805 F.3d at 321.  Respondent therefore \ncannot bootstrap from the Tax Court\u2019s authority to is-\nsue an injunction the \u201cmilder\u201d authority to issue a de-\nclaratory judgment.  Br. in Opp. 23 (quoting Steffel v. \nThompson, 415 U.S. 452, 466-467 (1974)). \nMore generally, Section 6330(e)(1)\u2019s limited grant of \nauthority to enjoin a specific collection action during a \nlevy-review proceeding does not provide for Tax Court \njurisdiction over any administrative action other than \nthe proposed levy that is \u201cthe subject of the requested \nhearing.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(1).  That provision simply \nprovides courts with an enforcement mechanism to pre-\n\n29 \n \nvent the use of a particular administrative collection \ntool\u2014an administrative levy to collect a specific under-\nlying liability\u2014while the taxpayer is provided the op-\nportunity to mount a pre-deprivation challenge to that \nlevy.  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(A) and (e). \nReading the exception in Section 6330(e) to open the \ndoor to more general declaratory and injunctive relief \nwould be at odds with Congress\u2019s determination, as a \ngeneral rule, to \u201cpermit the United States to assess and \ncollect taxes alleged to be due without judicial interven-\ntion, and to require that the legal right to the disputed \nsums be determined in a suit for refund.\u201d  Enochs v. \nWilliams Packing & Navigation Co., 370 U.S. 1, 7 \n(1962) (citing 26 U.S.C. 7421(a)); see, e.g., Phillips v. \nCommissioner, 283 U.S. 589, 595-597 (1931).  Congress\u2019s \ndecision to suspend certain collection procedures while \nlevy-review proceedings are pending\u2014and to authorize \nthe Tax Court to enforce that suspension\u2014did not cre-\nate additional exceptions to the general rule.4 \nc. Respondent suggests that the Tax Court\u2019s limited \npre-deprivation jurisdiction survives the IRS\u2019s aban-\n \n4 The court of appeals declined to decide whether the Tax Court \nhas \u201coverpayment or refund jurisdiction in a context like this,\u201d Pet. \nApp. 34a n.38, and respondent has not raised that issue in this Court, \nsee Br. in Opp. 21.  There is no general grant of refund jurisdiction \nin the Tax Court.  See, e.g., United States ex rel. Girard Trust Co. \nv. Helvering, 301 U.S. 540, 542 (1937) (addressing the Tax Court\u2019s \npredecessor); Empire Ordinance Corp. v. Harrington, 249 F.2d \n680, 682 (D.C. Cir. 1957).  And while Congress has given the Tax \nCourt jurisdiction to determine an overpayment or refund in certain \nspecific proceedings, see 26 U.S.C. 6015(e) and (g), 6213, 6214(a), \n6404(h), 6512(b), it has not done so with respect to pre-levy chal-\nlenges under Section 6330, see, e.g., Brown v. Commissioner, 58 \nF.4th 1064, 1066-1067 (9th Cir. 2023); McLane, 24 F.4th at 319; Will-\nson, 805 F.3d at 321; Greene-Thapedi, 126 T.C. at 8, 12-13. \n\n30 \n \ndonment of its proposed levy because, in other contexts, \n\u201cjurisdiction \u2018depend[s] upon the state of things at the \ntime of the action brought.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Br. in Opp. 16 (quoting \nGrupo Dataflux v. Atlas Global Grp., L.P., 541 U.S. 567, \n570 (2004)).  But as the cases that respondent cites make \nclear, \u201cthat principle is not absolute.\u201d  Coba v. Ford Mo-\ntor Co., 932 F.3d 114, 119 (3d Cir. 2019).  Most \u201cnotably, \nwhere a case becomes moot in the course of the litiga-\ntion,\u201d a court cannot continue to adjudicate it.  Cun-\nningham Charter Corp. v. LearJet, Inc., 592 F.3d 805, \n810 (7th Cir. 2010).  That is the case here:  Section 6330 \nprovides the Tax Court with jurisdiction to review a \n\u201cdetermination\u201d whether a proposed levy may proceed.  \n26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3) and (d)(1).  When there is no longer \nany need for such a determination, there is no need for \nreview of such a determination, and the Section 6330 \nproceeding is moot. \nEven outside of mootness scenarios, this Court has \nrecognized that a court may be deprived of subject- \nmatter jurisdiction by developments that fundamen-\ntally alter the basis for a lawsuit, such as \u201cthe with-\ndrawal of [the original] allegations\u201d on which jurisdic-\ntion was based.  Rockwell Int\u2019l Corp. v. United States, \n549 U.S. 457, 473 (2007).  The Court recently applied \nthat principle in Royal Canin U.S.A., Inc. v. Wull-\nschleger, 604 U.S. 22 (2025).  There, the plaintiff filed a \ncomplaint in state court containing both federal- and \nstate-law claims, and the defendant removed the case to \nfederal court, invoking federal-question jurisdiction \n(over the federal-law claims) and supplemental jurisdic-\ntion (over the state-law claims).  Id. at 28-29.  After the \nremoval, the plaintiff amended her complaint to remove \nthe federal claims.  Id. at 29.  This Court recognized \nthat, at that point, the \u201cchanges in claims\u201d had \u201ceffec-\n\n31 \n \ntively rema[d]e the suit.\u201d   Id. at 35.  Because there were \nno longer any federal-law claims to which the consider-\nation of state-law claims could be considered supple-\nmental, the district court had ceased to have any \u201csup-\nplemental jurisdiction at all.\u201d  Id. at 34. \nThe same logic applies here.  The fundamental basis \nfor a Section 6330 proceeding is the taxpayer\u2019s claim \nthat the IRS should not be allowed to collect a tax lia-\nbility via levy.  See C.A. App. 24 (respondent\u2019s petition \nfor review in the Tax Court sought review of the \u201cdeter-\nmination  * * *  reflected in [the] Notice of Determina-\ntion Concerning Collection Action[s]\u201d in her case, which \n\u201csustained the validity and appropriateness of a Final \nNotice of Intent to Levy\u201d).  Respondent\u2019s overpayments \nof taxes in subsequent years\u2014and the IRS\u2019s resulting \ndetermination that it \u201cno longer needs nor intends to \ncollect [respondent\u2019s] income tax liability\u201d via levy, C.A. \nDoc. 5-4, at 450\u2014effectively remade the suit, eliminat-\ning the need to determine whether the levy could pro-\nceed and hence any need to decide the underlying tax \nliability.  The Tax Court accordingly ceased to have ju-\nrisdiction under Section 6330.   \n2. The Tax Court has no \u201cimplicit\u201d jurisdiction to  \nreview offsets in a Section 6330 proceeding  \nThe court of appeals alternatively held that this case \nis not moot because the Tax Court could review the \nIRS\u2019s allocation of respondent\u2019s later-year overpay-\nments to offset her 2010 tax liability.  Pet. App. 20a-25a.  \nIn so holding, the court of appeals reasoned that, while \n\u201cit may be that Congress has not explicitly granted the \nTax Court such power,\u201d there is nevertheless \u201can im-\nplicit grant\u201d of jurisdiction that \u201callows the [Tax] Court \nto review setoffs in any event.\u201d  Id. at 20a. \n\n32 \n \nRespondent did not defend that aspect of the court \nof appeals\u2019 decision in her brief in opposition.  And for \ngood reason.  Tax Court jurisdiction must be expressly \nconferred by statute.  See p. 16, supra; 26 U.S.C. 7442 \n(\u201cThe Tax Court and its divisions shall have such juris-\ndiction as is conferred on them by this title, by chapters \n1, 2, 3, and 4 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, by \ntitle II and title III of the Revenue Act of 1926 (44 Stat. \n10\u201387), or by laws enacted subsequent to February 26, \n1926.\u201d).  And no statute grants the Tax Court jurisdic-\ntion to review in a Section 6330 proceeding the IRS\u2019s \nexercise of authority under Section 6402(a) to credit (or \noffset) a taxpayer\u2019s overpayments against her tax liabil-\nity.  To the contrary, Section 6330 grants the Tax Court \njurisdiction only to review\u2014and, if necessary, enjoin\u2014\nthe \u201clevy action[]\u201d that is the \u201csubject of the requested \nhearing.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(1).  It does not affect the \nIRS\u2019s ability to take other enforcement actions, includ-\ning the authority to credit overpayments against exist-\ning liabilities under Section 6402; nor does it grant the \nTax Court jurisdiction to review such actions.  See 26 \nC.F.R. 301.6330\u20131(g)(2), Q & A-G3; see also Belloff v. \nCommissioner, 996 F.2d 607, 616 (2d Cir. 1993).  Courts \nhave therefore repeatedly held that the Tax Court lacks \njurisdiction to review Section 6402(a) credits in a Sec-\ntion 6330 proceeding.  See, e.g., Boyd v. Commissioner, \n451 F.3d 8, 10-11 (1st Cir. 2006); Greene-Thapedi, 126 \nT.C. at 7-8.   \nMoreover, even if the Tax Court had jurisdiction to \nreview the application of credits under Section 6402 in \na Section 6330 proceeding, the court of appeals\u2019 moot-\nness holding would still be erroneous.  The court of ap-\npeals reasoned that the Tax Court has jurisdiction to \nreview the IRS\u2019s use of respondent\u2019s overpayments to \n\n33 \n \noffset her tax liability, and that those offsets were inva-\nlid, such that respondent should be deemed to have an \noutstanding tax liability for 2010.  Pet. App. 20a-25a.  \nAnd the court of appeals took the view that the Tax \nCourt therefore has jurisdiction to consider respond-\nent\u2019s challenge to \u201cthe IRS\u2019s application of the esti-\nmated payments\u201d to Gennardo rather than respondent.  \nPet. App. 19a.  But the Tax Court would have jurisdic-\ntion under Section 6330 to consider such a challenge \nonly in connection with a live dispute over a proposed \nlevy.  See pp. 16-31, supra.  And the IRS has no basis \nfor pursuing a levy so long as respondent\u2019s overpay-\nments remain \u201cin the government\u2019s pocket.\u201d  Pet. App. \n25a.  Nor did the court of appeals conclude that the Tax \nCourt could order the IRS to refund those overpay-\nments.  See p. 29 n.4, supra.  Thus, even if the applica-\ntion of credits was invalid\u2014and it was not5\u2014the Section \n6330 proceeding would still be moot at this point.  \nD. The Instant Case Is Moot \nApplying the foregoing principles, respondent\u2019s case \nis moot.  In 2012, respondent self-reported to the IRS \nthat she owed $21,918 in taxes for tax year 2010.  C.A. \nApp. 475.  The IRS assessed liability based on respond-\nent\u2019s representation.  Id. at 280; see 26 U.S.C. 6201(a)(1).  \nWhen the IRS then proposed to collect the liability by \n \n5 The court of appeals concluded that the application of credits vi-\nolated the common-law rule that \u201ca creditor cannot set off a disputed \ndebt with an undisputed one.\u201d  Pet. App. 22a.  But that rule has no \napplication under Section 6402(a), which authorizes the IRS to \n\u201ccredit the amount of [an] overpayment  * * *  against any liability,\u201d \nundisputed or not.  26 U.S.C. 6402(a).  The court also reasoned that \nthe application of credits violated \u201cArticle III mootness principles.\u201d  \nPet. App. 25a.  But no such principles limit the IRS\u2019s exercise of \nstatutory authority under Section 6402(a). \n\n34 \n \nadministrative levy, respondent timely requested a pre-\ndeprivation hearing under Section 6330 to argue that \ncertain estimated tax payments should be applied to her \naccount, which would have (more than) satisfied her re-\nported tax liability, such that the proposed levy could \nnot go forward.  C.A. App. 566.   \nDuring the pendency of her pre-levy proceedings, re-\nspondent made overpayments for subsequent tax years, \nand, under Section 6402(a), the IRS credited those new \npayments against respondent\u2019s 2010 liability.  With no \nunpaid tax remaining on respondent\u2019s underlying liabil-\nity, there is no basis to proceed with the levy that re-\nspondent had challenged.  In these circumstances, there \nis no live dispute subject to Section 6330, and the Tax \nCourt can grant no further relief in a Section 6330 pro-\nceeding.  The case is therefore moot.   \nContrary to respondent\u2019s suggestion, that result \ndoes not violate \u201cthe presumption favoring judicial re-\nview of administrative action.\u201d  Br. in Opp. 23 (citation \nomitted).  As respondent has acknowledged (id. at 2, 4, \n13, 16, 25), a holding that her Section 6330 proceeding \nis moot will not foreclose her from seeking judicial re-\nview because she could file a refund suit\u2014the tradi-\ntional mechanism for disputing the assessment or col-\nlection of a federal tax, and the one that is available re-\ngardless of whether the IRS had ever proposed to levy \non respondent\u2019s property.  See 26 U.S.C. 7422(a); 28 \nU.S.C. 1346(a)(1); see also 26 U.S.C. 7422(d) (deeming \noverpayment credits to be \u201cpayment[s]\u201d for purposes of \na refund suit).  This Court should hew to Section 6330\u2019s \nplain text, which limits the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to a \ndispute over a proposed levy. \n\n35 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThis Court should reverse the judgment of the court \nof appeals. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nSARAH M.

The Tax Court shall \nhave no jurisdiction under this paragraph to enjoin \n\n7a \n \nany action or proceeding unless a timely appeal has \nbeen filed under subsection (d)(1) and then only in re-\nspect of the unpaid tax or proposed levy to which the \ndetermination being appealed relates. \n(2) Levy upon appeal \n \nParagraph (1) shall not apply to a levy action while \nan appeal is pending if the underlying tax liability is \nnot at issue in the appeal and the court determines \nthat the Secretary has shown good cause not to sus-\npend the levy. \n(f\u200a) \nExceptions \nIf\u2014 \n \n(1) the Secretary has made a finding under the \nlast sentence of section 6331(a) that the collection of \ntax is in jeopardy, \n \n(2) the Secretary has served a levy on a State to \ncollect a Federal tax liability from a State tax refund, \n \n(3) the Secretary has served a disqualified em-\nployment tax levy, or \n \n(4) the Secretary has served a Federal contrac-\ntor levy, \nthis section shall not apply, except that the taxpayer \nshall be given the opportunity for the hearing described \nin this section within a reasonable period of time after \nthe levy. \n(g) \nFrivolous requests for hearing, etc. \nNotwithstanding any other provision of this section, \nif the Secretary determines that any portion of a request \nfor a hearing under this section or section 6320 meets \n\n8a \n \nthe requirement of clause (i) or (ii) of section 6702(b)(2)(A), \nthen the Secretary may treat such portion as if it were \nnever submitted and such portion shall not be subject to \nany further administrative or judicial review. \n(h) Definitions related to exceptions \nFor purposes of subsection (f\u200a)\u2014 \n(1) Disqualified employment tax levy \n \nA disqualified employment tax levy is any levy in \nconnection with the collection of employment taxes \nfor any taxable period if the person subject to the \nlevy (or any predecessor thereof\u200a) requested a hear-\ning under this section with respect to unpaid employ-\nment taxes arising in the most recent 2-year period \nbefore the beginning of the taxable period with  \nrespect to which the levy is served.  For purposes of \nthe preceding sentence, the term \u201cemployment taxes\u201d \nmeans any taxes under chapter 21, 22, 23, or 24. \n(2) Federal contractor levy \n \nA Federal contractor levy is any levy if the person \nwhose property is subject to the levy (or any prede-\ncessor thereof\u200a) is a Federal contractor. \n \n2. \n26 U.S.C. 6402(a) provides: \nAuthority to make credits or refunds \n(a) \nGeneral rule \nIn the case of any overpayment, the Secretary, within \nthe applicable period of limitations, may credit the amount \nof such overpayment, including any interest allowed \nthereon, against any liability in respect of an internal \n\n9a \n \nrevenue tax on the part of the person who made the \noverpayment and shall, subject to subsections (c), (d), \n(e), and (f\u200a), refund any balance to such person.",

This is a crucial document for understanding the full scope of the legal arguments in the case.\n\nTask EIG is very high (0.9) because, to form a robust prediction, it is essential to understand the arguments of both parties. So far, the analysis has likely focused on the petitioner's arguments and the lower court's reasoning. The respondent's brief will provide the direct counterarguments, the specific interpretation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6330, and the policy reasons supporting the Third Circuit's decision. The strength, framing, and specific legal authorities cited in this brief will be a primary determinant of the case's outcome, and reviewing it will significantly update my posterior beliefs about which side is likely to prevail.\n\nDesign EIG is moderate (0.5). The action of reading the opposing party's brief is a fundamental, best-practice step in any legal case analysis. While not a novel strategy, its consistent application and confirmation of its high value reinforces a core design principle: a complete and balanced analysis requires examining the primary source arguments from all sides. This reinforces the validity of a foundational heuristic for SCOTUS prediction, which is valuable for the overall design, even if it doesn't uncover a new technique.\n\nThe joint EIG is high, driven by the critical necessity of this information for the specific task.",

See I.R.C. \u00a7 6330. At the hearing, the \ntaxpayer may raise \u201cany relevant issue relating to the \nunpaid \ntax \nor \nthe \nproposed \nlevy.\u201d \nI.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A). The taxpayer may also challenge her \nunderlying tax liability if she did not previously have \nan opportunity to do so. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B). The Ap-\npeals Office issues a \u201cdetermination,\u201d which \u201cshall \ntake into consideration\u201d \u201cthe issues raised under par-\nagraph (2),\u201d including any challenge relating to the \nunpaid tax or the taxpayer\u2019s liability. I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(c)(3). After the Appeals Office renders its de-\ntermination, the taxpayer may \u201cpetition the Tax Court \nfor review of such determination,\u201d \u201cand the Tax Court \nshall have jurisdiction with respect to such matter.\u201d \nI.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). \nThe question presented is whether the Tax Court \nretains jurisdiction under I.R.C. \u00a7 6330 to review the \nAppeals Office\u2019s determination of the taxpayer\u2019s un-\npaid tax or underlying liability when, despite the \nparties\u2019 live dispute about that issue, the IRS stops \npursuing the levy, because it instead keeps the tax-\npayer\u2019s overpayments for later tax years. \n \n \n\nii \n \n \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDINGS AND \nRELATED PROCEEDINGS \nPetitioner\u2019s lists of the parties to the proceeding \nand directly related proceedings are complete and cor-\nrect. \n\niii \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \nQUESTION PRESENTED ........................................... i \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDINGS AND \nRELATED PROCEEDINGS ................................ ii \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES ....................................... vi \nINTRODUCTION ........................................................ 1 \nSTATEMENT .............................................................. 6 \nA. Legal background ........................................... 6 \nB.

The Tax Court had jurisdiction to \nreview the Appeals Office\u2019s \ndetermination of Zuch\u2019s entitlement to \nthe estimated payments. .............................. 21 \n1. Section 6330\u2019s plain text states that \nthe Tax Court has jurisdiction to \nreview the Appeals Office\u2019s \n\u201cdetermination\u201d of a taxpayer\u2019s \nchallenge to \u201cany relevant issue \nrelating to [her] unpaid tax\u201d or her \n\u201cunderlying liability.\u201d ............................. 21 \n2. Statutory context confirms that \nCongress gave the Tax Court \ncontinuing jurisdiction to resolve \nissues relating to the unpaid tax \nand tax liability disputes. ...................... 24 \n\niv \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \n(continued) \nPage \n \n \n3. The Tax Court had jurisdiction \nunder \u00a7 6330 to review the Appeals \nOffice\u2019s determination, including its \nresolution of Zuch\u2019s entitlement to \nthe estimated payments......................... 26 \nB. Zuch\u2019s case did not become moot when \nthe IRS decided to stop pursuing the \nlevy, because the parties disputed, and \nthe Tax Court had the power to \nadjudicate, Zuch\u2019s entitlement to the \nestimated payments. .................................... 27 \n1. A case becomes moot only when the \nparties no longer have a concrete \ninterest in the outcome of the \nlitigation and judicial relief is not \nlikely to redress any injury. ................... 28 \n2. Zuch\u2019s challenge isn\u2019t moot because \na favorable Tax Court ruling on \nunderlying liability or unpaid tax \nwould likely redress her pocketbook \ninjury. ..................................................... 28 \nII. The IRS\u2019s counterarguments lack merit. ........... 31 \nA. The Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to review \nwhether Zuch was entitled to the \nprepayments didn\u2019t dissolve once the \nIRS no longer needed the levy. .................... 31 \n1. There is no textual basis in \u00a7 6330 \nfor the government\u2019s continuing-\nlevy requirement. ................................... 32 \n\nv \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \n(continued) \nPage \n \n \n2. The government misconstrues \n\u00a7 6330\u2019s history and downplays its \nremedial purpose, which both \nsupport the Tax Court\u2019s \u00a7 6330 \njurisdiction to review unpaid tax \nand liability disputes even if the \nIRS no longer pursues the levy. ............. 36 \n3. Royal Canin doesn\u2019t help the \ngovernment. ............................................ 37 \n4. The government\u2019s policy argument \nis meritless. ............................................ 39 \nB. The Tax Court\u2019s authority is not limited \nto approving or rejecting a proposed \nlevy, but includes the power to issue \nbinding judgments. ....................................... 40 \nC. The government\u2019s claim that the parties \nlack a legally cognizable interest in the \ncase once the IRS decides not to move \nforward with the levy is incorrect. ............... 42 \nD. Whether Zuch\u2019s challenge is a dispute \nabout an unpaid tax or underlying \nliability is immaterial. .................................. 43 \nCONCLUSION .......................................................... 44 \n \n \n \n\nvi \n \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES \nPage(s) \nCASES \nB&B Hardware, Inc. v.

The answer is yes. The Tax Court has juris-\ndiction under Internal Revenue Code \u00a7 6330(d)(1) to \nreview the Appeals Office\u2019s determination and the \nmatters and issues that determination resolves, and \nnothing in \u00a7 6330 conditions that jurisdiction on the \nIRS\u2019s continuing pursuit of a levy. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1); \nsee I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c). The Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to re-\nview the Appeals Office\u2019s determination thus gives the \ncourt authority to rule on the taxpayer\u2019s unpaid tax or \nunderlying liability. And because the government is \nexpected to abide by judicial rulings, those rulings \nwould redress Zuch\u2019s pocketbook injury. This case is \nnot moot. \nJennifer Zuch owed about $27,000 for the 2010 tax \nyear. But she and her ex-husband had already made \n$50,000 in estimated payments to the IRS for the 2010 \ntax year, and Zuch asked the IRS to apply those pay-\nments to her tax bill. Zuch\u2019s ex-husband agreed that \nthose tax payments should be applied to Zuch\u2019s tax \nbill. But the IRS refused. Instead, it applied the full \n$50,000 in estimated payments to Zuch\u2019s ex-husband\u2019s \nbalance. It then threatened to seize Zuch\u2019s property to \ncollect her 2010 tax assessment. \nZuch exercised her right to a hearing under \n\u00a7 6330, which provides taxpayers with procedural pro-\ntections before the IRS may levy their property to \ncollect taxes. Congress enacted \u00a7 6330 as part of the \nInternal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform \n\n2 \n \n \nAct in response to abusive IRS collections practices \nthat forced some taxpayers to spend their life\u2019s sav-\nings on taxes the IRS or courts later determined they \nnever even owed. Practices & Procedures of the Inter-\nnal Revenue Service: Hearings Before the Committee \non Finance, 105th Cong., S. Hrg. 105-190 at 75-82 \n(1997) [hereinafter Hearings Before the Committee on \nFinance] (statement of Katherine Lund Hicks). Sec-\ntion 6330 ensures that taxpayers can dispute their tax \nbill before having to pay. The provision allows taxpay-\ners threatened with a levy to initiate administrative \nhearings before the Appeals Office and to raise \u201cany \nrelevant issue relating to the unpaid tax\u201d or challenge \ntheir liability if they haven\u2019t yet had a chance to do so. \nI.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2). Section 6330 also grants taxpayers \nan opportunity for meaningful judicial review by \ngranting the Tax Court jurisdiction to review the Ap-\npeals Office\u2019s determination. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). \nAt her administrative hearing, Zuch argued that \nthe IRS should have credited her with the $50,000 in \nestimated payments that she and her ex-husband had \nmade. Those payments would have covered her 2010 \ntax bill and entitled her to a refund. The Appeals Of-\nfice disagreed, concluding that Zuch was not entitled \nto any portion of the estimated payments and uphold-\ning the proposed levy. Zuch petitioned the Tax Court \nfor review of the Appeals Office\u2019s determination. But \nduring the course of the Tax Court proceedings, the \nIRS kept overpayments that Zuch made for later tax \nyears and used them to offset her disputed 2010 lia-\nbility. By 2019, after six years of litigation, the IRS \nclaimed that Zuch had satisfied the disputed liability, \nand it moved to dismiss the Tax Court proceedings as \nmoot. \n\n3 \n \n \nThe Tax Court agreed and dismissed the petition. \nAccording to the court, because there was no unpaid \nliability and no levy, the case was moot. Pet. App. 43a. \nThe court of appeals vacated and remanded. In a \npart of the opinion joined by two panel members, the \ncourt held that the case was not moot because the Tax \nCourt had jurisdiction to review the Appeals Office\u2019s \ndetermination of and declare Zuch\u2019s liability. Pet. \nApp. 25a-26a; see Pet. App. 25a-38a. And a declara-\ntory judgment, the court concluded, would redress \nZuch\u2019s injury. Pet. App. 37a-38a. \nThe court of appeals correctly recognized that the \nTax Court had jurisdiction to review the Appeals Of-\nfice\u2019s determination and that this case is not moot. \nThis Court should affirm. \n1. a. The Tax Court had, and retained, jurisdic-\ntion to review the Appeals Office\u2019s determination. \nSection 6330\u2019s plain text states that the Tax Court \n\u201cshall have jurisdiction\u201d to \u201creview\u201d the Appeals Of-\nfice\u2019s \u201cdetermination,\u201d including its resolution of \u201cany \nrelevant issue relating to the unpaid tax,\u201d or the tax-\npayer\u2019s \u201cunderlying tax liability.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2), \n(c)(3), (d)(1). Nothing in that language, or anything \nelse in \u00a7 6330, requires an ongoing attempt to levy the \ntaxpayer\u2019s property. Thus, the Tax Court retains ju-\nrisdiction \nto \nreview \nthe \nAppeals \nOffice\u2019s \ndetermination, even if the IRS stops pursuing a levy, \nso long as the taxpayer continues to dispute her un-\npaid tax or underlying liability. That makes sense, \ngiven that the whole point of \u00a7 6330 is to make sure \nthat levy proceedings are fair and that a taxpayer can \nchallenge her liability if she had no prior opportunity \nto do so. Indeed, the very design of \u00a7 6330 seeks to en-\nsure that the government is \u201cturn[ing] square corners \n\n4 \n \n \nin dealing with the people,\u201d Department of Homeland \nSecurity v. Regents of the University of California, 591 \nU.S. 1, 24 (2020).  \nb. This case is not moot. The Tax Court had au-\nthority to determine Zuch\u2019s entitlement to the \nprepayments. See I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). A case is moot \nonly when the parties no longer retain any interest in \nthe outcome of the proceedings. But here, both parties \nhave a concrete interest in the outcome of the litiga-\ntion: If Zuch wins, the IRS will likely refund her \nmoney. If the IRS wins, it will keep her money. Either \nway, the Tax Court\u2019s ruling will be preclusive in a re-\nfund suit\u2014which the government has invited Zuch to \nfile\u2014so the stakes are real. And Zuch has now filed a \nrefund suit in the District of New Jersey seeking to \nrecover some of her overpayments. \n2. The IRS\u2019s counterarguments are meritless. \nThe IRS claims that the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to re-\nview the Appeals Office\u2019s determination vanished, and \nthat the case is moot, because the IRS decided it no \nlonger needed a levy after it took Zuch\u2019s money an-\nother way. The government\u2019s arguments fail.  \nFirst, the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to review \nwhether Zuch was entitled to the prepayments didn\u2019t \ndisappear once the IRS stopped pursuing the levy. \nPlain text makes that clear. Although the term \u201clevy\u201d \nappears throughout \u00a7 6330, the provision that grants \nthe Tax Court jurisdiction over the Appeals Office\u2019s \ndetermination\u2014\u00a7 6330(d)(1)\u2014doesn\u2019t condition juris-\ndiction on a levy. History and purpose don\u2019t help the \ngovernment, either. Congress enacted \u00a7 6330 to rem-\nedy IRS abuses and give taxpayers a fair shot at \ndisputing what they owe before collection, underscor-\ning why Congress likely wanted the Tax Court to \n\n5 \n \n \nretain jurisdiction to resolve disputes over unpaid tax \nand liability. Section 6330 must be construed in light \nof that remedial purpose.  \nInvoking Royal Canin U.S.A., Inc. v. Wullschleger, \n604 U.S. 22 (2025), the government claims that the \nTax Court lost jurisdiction because the IRS fundamen-\ntally altered the basis of the suit when it decided not \nto seek the levy. But again, \u00a7 6330 gave the Tax Court \njurisdiction to review an Appeals Office determination \nand nothing in the provision requires a levy. See I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1). Put differently, \u00a7 6330(d) gives the Tax \nCourt jurisdiction so long as the taxpayer challenges \nan Appeals Office determination. The Court recently \nmade clear in the \u00a7 6330 context that a procedural re-\nquirement is jurisdictional only if Congress \u201cclearly \nstates\u201d that it is. Boechler, P.C. v. Commissioner, 596 \nU.S. 199, 203 (2022). But the word \u201clevy\u201d doesn\u2019t even \nappear in \u00a7 6330(d). In any event, even if \u00a7 6330 re-\nquired a levy, the requirement would look to the time \nof filing, and there was a proposed levy when Zuch pe-\ntitioned the Tax Court.  \nAppealing to policy, the government says that if \nthe Tax Court has jurisdiction to review liability dis-\nputes like Zuch\u2019s, the Tax Court will become a forum \nfor general liability claims. For starters, the govern-\nment hasn\u2019t pointed to any cases showing that \ntaxpayers are invoking \u00a7 6330 to bring general liabil-\nity challenges. Plus, to invoke the Tax Court\u2019s \u00a7 6330 \njurisdiction, a taxpayer needs an Appeals Office deter-\nmination. The Tax Court can address unpaid tax or \nliability issues only if the Appeals Office\u2019s determina-\ntion resolved them. What\u2019s more, the question \npresented in this case rarely arises, and when it does, \nit\u2019s only because the IRS starts levy proceedings, gets \nthe taxpayer\u2019s money another way, and once the Tax \n\n6 \n \n \nCourt is reviewing the determination, decides to aban-\ndon the levy midstream. The IRS can easily avoid its \nself-made problem.  \nSecond, the government asserts that the Tax \nCourt lacks authority to declare Zuch\u2019s entitlement to \nthe prepayments because the Declaratory Judgment \nAct (DJA) and Anti-Injunction Act (AIA) generally \nprohibit courts from issuing declaratory and injunc-\ntive relief in federal tax cases. That argument fails. \nSection 6330(d)(1) authorizes the Tax Court to deter-\nmine the taxpayer\u2019s unpaid tax and underlying \nliability in \u00a7 6330 proceedings. And \u00a7 6330(e)(1) con-\nfirms that the Tax Court can issue declaratory relief, \nexempting \u00a7 6330 proceedings from the DJA\u2019s and \nAIA\u2019s prohibitions on declaratory and injunctive relief \nin other tax cases.  \nFinally, the government claims it mooted the case \nby abandoning the levy because the levy gave rise to \nthe proceeding. But that\u2019s not how moot\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

See I.R.C. \u00a7 6330. At the hearing, the \ntaxpayer may raise \u201cany relevant issue relating to the \nunpaid \ntax \nor \nthe \nproposed \nlevy.\u201d \nI.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A). The taxpayer may also challenge her \nunderlying tax liability if she did not previously have \nan opportunity to do so. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B). The Ap-\npeals Office issues a \u201cdetermination,\u201d which \u201cshall \ntake into consideration\u201d \u201cthe issues raised under par-\nagraph (2),\u201d including any challenge relating to the \nunpaid tax or the taxpayer\u2019s liability.

The answer is yes. The Tax Court has juris-\ndiction under Internal Revenue Code \u00a7 6330(d)(1) to \nreview the Appeals Office\u2019s determination and the \nmatters and issues that determination resolves, and \nnothing in \u00a7 6330 conditions that jurisdiction on the \nIRS\u2019s continuing pursuit of a levy. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1); \nsee I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c). The Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to re-\nview the Appeals Office\u2019s determination thus gives the \ncourt authority to rule on the taxpayer\u2019s unpaid tax or \nunderlying liability. And because the government is \nexpected to abide by judicial rulings, those rulings \nwould redress Zuch\u2019s pocketbook injury. This case is \nnot moot. \nJennifer Zuch owed about $27,000 for the 2010 tax \nyear. But she and her ex-husband had already made \n$50,000 in estimated payments to the IRS for the 2010 \ntax year, and Zuch asked the IRS to apply those pay-\nments to her tax bill. Zuch\u2019s ex-husband agreed that \nthose tax payments should be applied to Zuch\u2019s tax \nbill. But the IRS refused. Instead, it applied the full \n$50,000 in estimated payments to Zuch\u2019s ex-husband\u2019s \nbalance. It then threatened to seize Zuch\u2019s property to \ncollect her 2010 tax assessment. \nZuch exercised her right to a hearing under \n\u00a7 6330, which provides taxpayers with procedural pro-\ntections before the IRS may levy their property to \ncollect taxes. Congress enacted \u00a7 6330 as part of the \nInternal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform \n\n2 \n \n \nAct in response to abusive IRS collections practices \nthat forced some taxpayers to spend their life\u2019s sav-\nings on taxes the IRS or courts later determined they \nnever even owed. Practices & Procedures of the Inter-\nnal Revenue Service: Hearings Before the Committee \non Finance, 105th Cong., S. Hrg. 105-190 at 75-82 \n(1997) [hereinafter Hearings Before the Committee on \nFinance] (statement of Katherine Lund Hicks). Sec-\ntion 6330 ensures that taxpayers can dispute their tax \nbill before having to pay. The provision allows taxpay-\ners threatened with a levy to initiate administrative \nhearings before the Appeals Office and to raise \u201cany \nrelevant issue relating to the unpaid tax\u201d or challenge \ntheir liability if they haven\u2019t yet had a chance to do so. \nI.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2). Section 6330 also grants taxpayers \nan opportunity for meaningful judicial review by \ngranting the Tax Court jurisdiction to review the Ap-\npeals Office\u2019s determination. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). \nAt her administrative hearing, Zuch argued that \nthe IRS should have credited her with the $50,000 in \nestimated payments that she and her ex-husband had \nmade. Those payments would have covered her 2010 \ntax bill and entitled her to a refund. The Appeals Of-\nfice disagreed, concluding that Zuch was not entitled \nto any portion of the estimated payments and uphold-\ning the proposed levy. Zuch petitioned the Tax Court \nfor review of the Appeals Office\u2019s determination. But \nduring the course of the Tax Court proceedings, the \nIRS kept overpayments that Zuch made for later tax \nyears and used them to offset her disputed 2010 lia-\nbility. By 2019, after six years of litigation, the IRS \nclaimed that Zuch had satisfied the disputed liability, \nand it moved to dismiss the Tax Court proceedings as \nmoot. \n\n3 \n \n \nThe Tax Court agreed and dismissed the petition. \nAccording to the court, because there was no unpaid \nliability and no levy, the case was moot. Pet. App. 43a. \nThe court of appeals vacated and remanded. In a \npart of the opinion joined by two panel members, the \ncourt held that the case was not moot because the Tax \nCourt had jurisdiction to review the Appeals Office\u2019s \ndetermination of and declare Zuch\u2019s liability. Pet. \nApp. 25a-26a; see Pet. App. 25a-38a. And a declara-\ntory judgment, the court concluded, would redress \nZuch\u2019s injury. Pet. App. 37a-38a. \nThe court of appeals correctly recognized that the \nTax Court had jurisdiction to review the Appeals Of-\nfice\u2019s determination and that this case is not moot. \nThis Court should affirm. \n1. a. The Tax Court had, and retained, jurisdic-\ntion to review the Appeals Office\u2019s determination. \nSection 6330\u2019s plain text states that the Tax Court \n\u201cshall have jurisdiction\u201d to \u201creview\u201d the Appeals Of-\nfice\u2019s \u201cdetermination,\u201d including its resolution of \u201cany \nrelevant issue relating to the unpaid tax,\u201d or the tax-\npayer\u2019s \u201cunderlying tax liability.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2), \n(c)(3), (d)(1). Nothing in that language, or anything \nelse in \u00a7 6330, requires an ongoing attempt to levy the \ntaxpayer\u2019s property. Thus, the Tax Court retains ju-\nrisdiction \nto \nreview \nthe \nAppeals \nOffice\u2019s \ndetermination, even if the IRS stops pursuing a levy, \nso long as the taxpayer continues to dispute her un-\npaid tax or underlying liability. That makes sense, \ngiven that the whole point of \u00a7 6330 is to make sure \nthat levy proceedings are fair and that a taxpayer can \nchallenge her liability if she had no prior opportunity \nto do so. Indeed, the very design of \u00a7 6330 seeks to en-\nsure that the government is \u201cturn[ing] square corners \n\n4 \n \n \nin dealing with the people,\u201d Department of Homeland \nSecurity v. Regents of the University of California, 591 \nU.S. 1, 24 (2020).  \nb. This case is not moot. The Tax Court had au-\nthority to determine Zuch\u2019s entitlement to the \nprepayments. See I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). A case is moot \nonly when the parties no longer retain any interest in \nthe outcome of the proceedings. But here, both parties \nhave a concrete interest in the outcome of the litiga-\ntion: If Zuch wins, the IRS will likely refund her \nmoney. If the IRS wins, it will keep her money. Either \nway, the Tax Court\u2019s ruling will be preclusive in a re-\nfund suit\u2014which the government has invited Zuch to \nfile\u2014so the stakes are real. And Zuch has now filed a \nrefund suit in the District of New Jersey seeking to \nrecover some of her overpayments. \n2. The IRS\u2019s counterarguments are meritless. \nThe IRS claims that the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to re-\nview the Appeals Office\u2019s determination vanished, and \nthat the case is moot, because the IRS decided it no \nlonger needed a levy after it took Zuch\u2019s money an-\nother way. The government\u2019s arguments fail.  \nFirst, the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to review \nwhether Zuch was entitled to the prepayments didn\u2019t \ndisappear once the IRS stopped pursuing the levy. \nPlain text makes that clear. Although the term \u201clevy\u201d \nappears throughout \u00a7 6330, the provision that grants \nthe Tax Court jurisdiction over the Appeals Office\u2019s \ndetermination\u2014\u00a7 6330(d)(1)\u2014doesn\u2019t condition juris-\ndiction on a levy. History and purpose don\u2019t help the \ngovernment, either. Congress enacted \u00a7 6330 to rem-\nedy IRS abuses and give taxpayers a fair shot at \ndisputing what they owe before collection, underscor-\ning why Congress likely wanted the Tax Court to \n\n5 \n \n \nretain jurisdiction to resolve disputes over unpaid tax \nand liability. Section 6330 must be construed in light \nof that remedial purpose.  \nInvoking Royal Canin U.S.A., Inc. v. Wullschleger, \n604 U.S. 22 (2025), the government claims that the \nTax Court lost jurisdiction because the IRS fundamen-\ntally altered the basis of the suit when it decided not \nto seek the levy. But again, \u00a7 6330 gave the Tax Court \njurisdiction to review an Appeals Office determination \nand nothing in the provision requires a levy. See I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1). Put differently, \u00a7 6330(d) gives the Tax \nCourt jurisdiction so long as the taxpayer challenges \nan Appeals Office determination. The Court recently \nmade clear in the \u00a7 6330 context that a procedural re-\nquirement is jurisdictional only if Congress \u201cclearly \nstates\u201d that it is. Boechler, P.C. v. Commissioner, 596 \nU.S. 199, 203 (2022). But the word \u201clevy\u201d doesn\u2019t even \nappear in \u00a7 6330(d). In any event, even if \u00a7 6330 re-\nquired a levy, the requirement would look to the time \nof filing, and there was a proposed levy when Zuch pe-\ntitioned the Tax Court.  \nAppealing to policy, the government says that if \nthe Tax Court has jurisdiction to review liability dis-\nputes like Zuch\u2019s, the Tax Court will become a forum \nfor general liability claims. For starters, the govern-\nment hasn\u2019t pointed to any cases showing that \ntaxpayers are invoking \u00a7 6330 to bring general liabil-\nity challenges. Plus, to invoke the Tax Court\u2019s \u00a7 6330 \njurisdiction, a taxpayer needs an Appeals Office deter-\nmination. The Tax Court can address unpaid tax or \nliability issues only if the Appeals Office\u2019s determina-\ntion resolved them. What\u2019s more, the question \npresented in this case rarely arises, and when it does, \nit\u2019s only because the IRS starts levy proceedings, gets \nthe taxpayer\u2019s money another way, and once the Tax \n\n6 \n \n \nCourt is reviewing the determination, decides to aban-\ndon the levy midstream. The IRS can easily avoid its \nself-made problem.  \nSecond, the government asserts that the Tax \nCourt lacks authority to declare Zuch\u2019s entitlement to \nthe prepayments because the Declaratory Judgment \nAct (DJA) and Anti-Injunction Act (AIA) generally \nprohibit courts from issuing declaratory and injunc-\ntive relief in federal tax cases. That argument fails. \nSection 6330(d)(1) authorizes the Tax Court to deter-\nmine the taxpayer\u2019s unpaid tax and underlying \nliability in \u00a7 6330 proceedings. And \u00a7 6330(e)(1) con-\nfirms that the Tax Court can issue declaratory relief, \nexempting \u00a7 6330 proceedings from the DJA\u2019s and \nAIA\u2019s prohibitions on declaratory and injunctive relief \nin other tax cases.  \nFinally, the government claims it mooted the case \nby abandoning the levy because the levy gave rise to \nthe proceeding. But that\u2019s not how mootness works. \nThe question is whether the parties retain any inter-\nest in the outcome of the litigation. And here, both \nZuch and the IRS have a concrete interest in whether \nand how the Tax Court adjudicates Zuch\u2019s entitlement \nto the estimated payments. \nThe Court should affirm the court of appeals\u2019 de-\ncision and remand so the Tax Court can consider \nZuch\u2019s merits arguments. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal background \n1. Taxpayers often have various ways to dispute \nthe amount of income taxes and other taxes the IRS \nclaims they owe. If the IRS determines that a taxpayer \nowes more taxes than she reported on her tax return, \n\n7 \n \n \nthe IRS typically sends her a notice of deficiency. \nI.R.C. \u00a7 6212(a). Within 90 days, the taxpayer may \nchallenge the claimed deficiency in Tax Court. I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6213(a). In the deficiency proceeding, the Tax Court \ncan determine the correct amount of tax owed and \nwhether the taxpayer made overpayments, entitling \nthe taxpayer to a refund or credit. I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6214(a), \n6512(b)(1). The Tax Court\u2019s final decision is reviewa-\nble by a court of appeals. I.R.C. \u00a7 7482(a)(1). If the \ntaxpayer does not challenge the deficiency, she can \npay the disputed amount and seek a refund in district \ncourt or the Court of Federal Claims. 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1346(a)(1); see I.R.C. \u00a7 7422(a).  \n2. This case centers on a third way a taxpayer \ncan challenge the taxes the IRS assesses when the \ntaxpayer has not paid the taxes the IRS claims she \nowes and the IRS seeks to collect by levying the tax-\npayer\u2019s property. Sometimes, a tax remains unpaid \neven after a taxpayer receives a notice of deficiency. \nOr perhaps a taxpayer hasn\u2019t paid the amount the IRS \nclaims she owes, but she didn\u2019t receive a notice of de-\nficiency or otherwise have an opportunity to dispute \nher liability. In either situation, the IRS may decide \nto pursue a levy on the taxpayer\u2019s property. I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6331(a), (b). \nIf the IRS issues a levy notice, the taxpayer has 30 \ndays to request an administrative hearing before the \nAppeals Office under I.R.C. \u00a7 6330, sometimes called \na \u201ccollection due process\u201d hearing, to challenge the \nproposed levy and her underlying tax liability. I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(b), (c)(2)(B); see Boechler, 596 U.S. at 202; \nByers v. Commissioner, 740 F.3d 668, 671-72 (D.C. \nCir. 2014). This case involves a \u00a7 6330 proceeding in \nwhich the parties dispute the taxpayer\u2019s liability and \nunpaid tax.  \n\n8 \n \n \na. The issues a taxpayer may raise in a collection \ndue process hearing depend in part on whether the \ntaxpayer received a notice of deficiency or had another \nopportunity to dispute her liability. If she did not, she \nmay raise \u201cchallenges to the existence or amount\u201d of \nher liability. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B). A collection due \nprocess hearing thus serves as a backstop, ensuring \nthat a taxpayer has an opportunity to dispute her un-\nderlying tax liability because she was not able to do so \nearlier. Liability challenges aside, all taxpayers in col-\nlection due process proceedings may raise \u201cany \nrelevant issue relating to the unpaid tax or the pro-\nposed levy, including\u201d \u201cappropriate spousal defenses,\u201d \n\u201cchallenges to the appropriateness of collection ac-\ntions,\u201d and \u201coffers of collection alternatives,\u201d no \nmatter whether they had an earlier opportunity to dis-\npute their liability. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A). The Appeals \nOffice then makes a \u201cdetermination\u201d that \u201cshall take \ninto consideration\u201d the taxpayer\u2019s challenge to the un-\npaid tax, her underlying liability, and any other issues \nraised. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(3). \nAlthough it is an important backstop, a collection \ndue process hearing \u201clacks the typical hallmarks of a \njudicial hearing\u201d and is \u201cfar from \u2026 a formal hearing.\u201d \nFarhy v. Commissioner, 100 F.4th 223, 227 (D.C. Cir. \n2024). \u201cThere are no formal discovery procedures, and \nthe taxpayer has no right to subpoena documents or \nwitnesses.\u201d Id. Rather, the hearing \u201cprovides the tax-\npayer \u2018an opportunity for an informal oral or written \nconversation with the IRS.\u2019\u201d Id. \nAfter the Appeals Office issues its \u201cdetermina-\ntion,\u201d the taxpayer may \u201cpetition the Tax Court for \nreview of such determination (and the Tax Court shall \nhave jurisdiction with respect to such matter).\u201d I.R.C. \n\n9 \n \n \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1). The Tax Court\u2019s final judgment is subject \nto review in a court of appeals. I.R.C. \u00a7 7482(a)(1). \nb. Congress enacted \u00a7 6330 in 1998 to protect \ntaxpayers from the IRS\u2019s abusive tax collection prac-\ntices. E.g., 144 Cong. Rec. S4027-32 (daily ed. May 1, \n1998). Leading up to \u00a7 6330\u2019s enactment, Congress \nheld a series of hearings that shed light on those prac-\ntices. For example, taxpayers couldn\u2019t contest a levy \nbefore the IRS seized their property. See Phillips v. \nCommissioner, 283 U.S. 589, 595-96 (1931). And tax-\npayers were often forced to drain their life\u2019s savings\u2014\nand their family\u2019s\u2014to pay assessments they never \neven owed. Hearings Before the Committee on Finance \nat 75-82 (statement of Katherine Lund Hicks). After \nthe hearings, \u201c[m]any people were shocked to learn \nthat a number of the due-process protections Ameri-\ncans take for granted in other legal proceedings do not \napply to actions involving the IRS.\u201d 144 Cong. Rec. \nS4031 (statement of Sen. Enzi). As one member put it, \n\u201cthe problem is, [the IRS] ha[s] too much power, they \nhave no checks and balances.\u201d Hearings Before the \nCommittee on Finance at 56 (statement of Sen. \nGramm). \nIn designing \u00a7 6330, Congress sought to \u201censure \nthat all taxpayers have due process and that the IRS \ndoes not abusively use its liens-and-seizure author-\nity.\u201d 143 Cong. Rec. S12231 (daily ed. Nov. 9, 1997) \n(statement of Sen. Roth). Indeed, the point of \u00a7 6330 \nproceedings is to \u201cincrease fairness to taxpayers\u201d be-\nfore the IRS deprives them of their property. S. Rep. \nNo. 105-174, at 67 (1998). And, as the Tax Court has \nobserved, Congress sought to ensure that the Commis-\nsioner would \u201ccollect the correct amount of tax, and do \nso by observing all applicable laws and administrative \n\n10 \n \n \nprocedures.\u201d Montgomery v. Commissioner, 122 T.C. \n1, 10 (2004). \nTo that end, \u00a7 6330 allows a taxpayer to raise is-\nsues relating to the unpaid tax and also challenge her \nliability if she did not have an earlier opportunity to \ndo so. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2). Section 6330 also gives the \ntaxpayer a chance \u201cto petition the Tax Court to contest \nthe Appeals [Office\u2019s] decision.\u201d 144 Cong. Rec. S4494 \n(daily ed. May 7, 1998) (statement of Sen. Hatch). And \nonce a taxpayer has petitioned the Tax Court, that \ncourt can enjoin any action or proceeding \u201cin respect \nof the unpaid tax or proposed levy.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(e)(1). \nThat makes sense: ensuring that the IRS is collecting \nthe correct amount of tax requires giving taxpayers an \nopportunity to dispute issues relating to the taxes \nthey haven\u2019t paid and their tax liability, and having \nthe Tax Court weigh in before the IRS can take their \nmoney. \nB. Factual and procedural background \nThis case arises from a dispute over whether the \nIRS properly credited $50,000 in overpayments from \nZuch and her ex-husband, Patrick Gennardo, to Gen-\nnardo\u2019s tax bill rather than Zuch\u2019s in the wake of their \ndivorce. Both Zuch and Gennardo maintain that the \nIRS should have credited Zuch\u2019s account, but the IRS \ninstead credited Gennardo\u2019s, sought to levy Zuch\u2019s \nproperty, and unilaterally decided to withhold over-\npayments Zuch made in later tax years. \n1. Zuch and Gennardo were married from 1993 \nto 2014. Pet. App. 7a. They separated in 2010, and \nZuch initiated divorce proceedings in 2012. CA3 \nApp. A118. During that time, the IRS assessed sub-\nstantial taxes against Zuch and Gennardo, prompting \nyears of litigation. \n\n11 \n \n \na. In 2010 and 2011, Zuch and Gennardo submit-\nted $50,000 in prepayments to the IRS for what they \nestimated would be their 2010 tax liability. Pet. \nApp. 8a. In particular, in June 2010, they submitted \nan estimated payment of $20,000 using a check drawn \nfrom a bank account listing both their names. Pet. \nApp. 8a & n.11. The form accompanying the check also \nlisted both names. Pet. App. 8a n.11, 51a. In January \n2011, Gennardo sent the IRS a check for $30,000. Pet. \nApp. 8a. The subject line of the letter accompanying \nthe check read \u201cRe: Patrick J. Gennardo and Jennifer \nZuch,\u201d and although the check was from Zuch and \nGennardo\u2019s joint bank account, the check listed only \nGennardo\u2019s name. Pet. App. 8a n.12, 51a. At the time, \nZuch and Gennardo didn\u2019t tell the IRS how to allocate \nthe payments. Pet. App. 8a. \nb. In 2012 and 2013, Zuch and Gennardo filed \nuntimely, and later amended, tax returns for 2010, \nand the IRS applied the $50,000 in prepayments to \nGennardo\u2019s, rather than Zuch\u2019s, tax bill. Pet. App. 7a-\n8a. The IRS\u2019s decision gave rise to the parties\u2019 dispute \nover Zuch\u2019s 2010 tax balance. \nIn September 2012, Zuch and Gennardo each filed \na married-filing-separately income tax return. Pet. \nApp. 7a. Zuch\u2019s return showed an adjusted gross in-\ncome of $74,493 and a $731 overpayment, and didn\u2019t \nmention the prepayments from 2010 and 2011. Pet. \nApp. 7a-8a & n.9. Gennardo\u2019s return showed an ad-\njusted gross income of $1,077,213, indicated that he \nowed $385,393 in taxes, and reported $10,000 in esti-\nmated payments. Pet. App. 8a-9a, 52a. The same day \nthat Gennardo filed his return, he also filed an offer-\nin-compromise, seeking to settle his accumulated tax \ndebts at less than the amount due. Id.; see I.R.C. \n\u00a7 7122(a). The IRS later notified him that it had \n\n12 \n \n \napplied the $50,000 in prepayments towards the \n$385,393 in taxes he owed. Pet. App. 8a. \nIn November 2012, Zuch filed an amended return \nfor 2010 to report $71,000 in additional income from a \nretirement account distribution. Pet. App. 9a. Zuch\u2019s \namended return showed that she owed the IRS \n$27,682. Id. She explained that the $50,000 in prepay-\nments should be credited to her and requested a \nrefund of $21,918. Id. In February 2013, the IRS as-\nsessed the additional $27,682 in taxes that Zuch \nreported, but it refused to credit her for the $50,000 or \nissue any refund. Id. \nGennardo also filed an amended return for 2010 \nin November 2012. Pet. App. 52a-53a. On that \namended return, he reported $0 in prepayments. Id. \nSubsequently, in March 2013, while his offer-in-com-\npromise was pending, Gennardo filed a second \namended return for 2010. Pet. App. 9a. He indicated \non that second amended return that the $50,000 in \nprepayments should be credited to Zuch, but the IRS \nstill refused to allocate it to her tax bill. Pet. App. 9a-\n10a; see Pet. App. 55a. \nc. Gennardo later submitted an amended offer-\nin-compromise in which he offered the IRS a signifi-\ncantly larger payment of tax, which the IRS accepted. \nPet. App. 10a. Even though Gennardo had asked the \nIRS to credit the $50,000 to Zuch, the IRS credited the \nentire sum to him. Id. \n2. Zuch never received a notice of deficiency from \nthe IRS. Pet. App. 9a n.13. But in August 2013, the \nIRS notified her that it intended to levy her property \nbecause she had failed to pay her 2010 tax assessment \nand explained that she had 30 days to request a \n\n13 \n \n \ncollection due process hearing before the Appeals Of-\nfice. Pet. App. 10a. \n3. Zuch timely requested a hearing. Id. At the \nhearing, Zuch challenged her \u201cunderlying tax liabil-\nity\u201d because she did not receive a notice of deficiency \nor otherwise have an opportunity to dispute it. I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B); Pet. App. 10a. Zuch argued that the \n$50,000 in prepayments should have been credited to \nher, reducing her tax liability to $0 and entitling her \nto a refund. Pet. App. 10a. \nIn September 2014, the Appeals Office rejected \nZuch\u2019s \u201c[c]hallenges to [her] [l]iability,\u201d Pet. App. 66a, \nand sustained the proposed levy. It told Zuch that it \nwas \u201cnot in a position\u201d to credit her for the $50,000 \nbecause the IRS had credited the money to Gennardo. \nPet. App. 11a. \n4. Zuch petitioned the Tax Court to review the \nAppeals Office\u2019s determination. Id. In particular, she \nsought a ruling that the $50,000 should have been ap-\nplied to her individual tax balance. Id. After the IRS \nmoved for summary judgment, the Tax Court re-\nmanded to the Appeals Office because it wasn\u2019t clear \nwhy the IRS had applied the $50,000 towards Gen-\nnardo\u2019s liability rather than Zuch\u2019s. Pet. App. 11a-\n12a. \n5. In June 2017, the Appeals Office again ruled \nagainst Zuch on the \u201c[i]ssues relating to [her] unpaid \n[underlying] liability,\u201d Pet. App. 48a, and sustained \nthe proposed levy, Pet. App. 12a. It reasoned that the \nlevy \u201cbalance[d] the need for efficient collection of \ntaxes with the taxpayer\u2019s legitimate concern that any \ncollection action be no more intrusive than necessary.\u201d \nCA3 App. A270. \n\n14 \n \n \n6. The case returned to the Tax Court. Pet. \nApp. 12a. Meanwhile, over the course of the six years \nthe \u00a7 6330 proceedings had been pending, Zuch kept \npaying her taxes for later years. In fact, she overpaid. \nBut rather than issuing her refunds, the IRS kept \nZuch\u2019s overpayments and used them to offset her \nclaimed 2010 liability. Pet. App. 12a-13a. The IRS did \nso six times, \u201conce each in 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2019, \nand twice in 2016.\u201d Id. And in April 2019, after the \ncase had returned to the Tax Court, the IRS kept \nZuch\u2019s money a final time to offset the rest of her \nclaimed 2010 tax balance, reducing it to $0. Pet. \nApp. 13a. \nThe IRS then moved to dismiss the Tax Court pro-\nceedings as moot. Id. The Tax Court granted the \nmotion. Id. The Tax Court concluded that it lacked ju-\nrisdiction over the case and that the case was moot \nbecause \u201cthere [was] no unpaid liability \u2026 upon which \na levy could be based,\u201d and the IRS was no longer \nseeking to levy Zuch\u2019s property. Pet. App. 43a. \n7. The Third Circuit vacated the Tax Court\u2019s de-\ncision, held that the Tax Court had jurisdiction under \n\u00a7 6330 to decide Zuch\u2019s challenge to her tax liability or \nunpaid tax, held that the case wasn\u2019t moot, and re-\nmanded for proceedings on the merits. Pet. App. 1a-\n39a. \nThe court first held that the Tax Court had juris-\ndiction to review the Appeals Office\u2019s determination of \nZuch\u2019s liability. Because Zuch had neither received a \nnotice of deficiency nor had an opportunity to contest \nher liability before her collection due process hearing, \nZuch could challenge \u201cthe existence or amount of [her] \nunderlying tax liability\u201d during the hearing. Pet. \nApp. 14a-15a; (quoting I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B)). And, \n\n15 \n \n \nthe court explained, \u201cZuch\u2019s argument that her esti-\nmated tax payments were erroneously allocated to her \nex-husband is a challenge to her underlying tax liabil-\nity under \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B).\u201d Pet. App. 19a. \nThe court of appeals then held that the Tax Court \nhad jurisdiction over Zuch\u2019s challenge, and that Zuch\u2019s \nchallenge was not moot, for two independent reasons. \nPet. App. 19a-38a. First, the court held that Zuch \ncould continue challenging her underlying liability be-\ncause the IRS unlawfully offset it using her \noverpayments in later years. Pet. App. 19a-25a. The \nIRS\u2019s unilateral, illegal actions, the court held, could \nnot moot the case. Pet. App. 25a. Second, in a part of \nthe opinion joined by two panel members, the court \nheld that the Tax Court had jurisdiction to review the \nAppeals Office\u2019s determination of Zuch\u2019s liability and \nissue a declaratory judgment because the parties con-\ntinued to dispute Zuch\u2019s tax liability. Pet. App. 25a-\n26a; see Pet. App. 25a-38a. And a declaratory judg-\nment, the court concluded, would redress Zuch\u2019s \ninjuries. Pet. App. 37a-38a. \n8. The IRS sought rehearing en banc, which the \ncourt of appeals denied. Pet. App. 68a-69a. It then \nsought a writ of certiorari, which this Court granted \non January 10, 2025. \n9. On March 14, 2025, Zuch filed a suit in the \nU.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey seek-\ning refunds for the 2010, 2012, 2013, and 2018 tax \nyears pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(a)(1) and I.R.C. \n\u00a7 7422(a). Compl., Zuch v. United States, No. 2:25-cv-\n01900 (D.N.J. Mar. 14, 2025). If successful, Zuch will \nrecover approximately two-thirds of the taxes the IRS \ncollected after it refused to credit her for the estimated \npayments. See Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 108-09. But Zuch is unable \n\n16 \n \n \nto request the return of approximately $20,000 in \noverpayments the IRS kept from the 2014 and 2015 \ntax years, due to the onerous jurisdictional prerequi-\nsites to filing a refund suit. Compl. \u00b6 109. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI. \nThe Tax Court had jurisdiction to review \nZuch\u2019s challenge relating to her unpaid tax or under-\nlying tax liability, and to adjudicate her entitlement \nto the estimated payments. The Tax Court retained \nthat jurisdiction and authority to issue a binding rul-\ning even after the IRS stopped pursuing the levy. This \ncase isn\u2019t moot.  \nA.  The Tax Court had, and retained, jurisdiction \nto review the Appeals Office\u2019s determination of Zuch\u2019s \nestimated payment dispute. \n1. Section 6330\u2019s plain text makes clear that the \nTax Court has authority to review the Appeals Office\u2019s \ndetermination of a taxpayer\u2019s challenge relating to her \nunpaid tax or underlying liability. Section 6330 pro-\nvides that a taxpayer may raise \u201cany relevant issue \nrelating to the unpaid tax\u201d at a collection due process \nhearing, and also may raise a challenge to her \u201cunder-\nlying tax liability\u201d when she didn\u2019t have an \nopportunity to do so before. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2). The \nAppeals Office\u2019s \u201cdetermination\u201d must \u201ctake [those is-\nsues] into consideration,\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(3), and the \nTax Court \u201cshall have jurisdiction\u201d to review that de-\ntermination, I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). Nothing in those \nprovisions makes jurisdiction turn on a continuing-\nlevy requirement, much less satisfies the requirement \nthat jurisdictional prerequisites be clearly stated, see \nBoechler, 596 U.S. at 203. The Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction \nunder \u00a7 6330 thus doesn\u2019t vanish when the IRS stops \npursuing a levy. \n\n17 \n \n \n2.  Context confirms that Congress gave the Tax \nCourt continuing jurisdiction under \u00a7 6330 to review \nAppeals Office determinations, including their resolu-\ntion of unpaid tax and tax liability issues. Section \n6330(c)(2)(B) ensures that a taxpayer has a chance to \nchallenge the unpaid tax and her underlying liability \nbefore she must pay or face a levy, and without initi-\nating new litigation against the federal government to \nseek a refund, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(a)(1); I.R.C. \n\u00a7 7422(a).  \n3.  The Tax Court had jurisdiction to review the \nAppeals Office\u2019s determination, including Zuch\u2019s enti-\ntlement to the estimated payments. In proceedings \nbefore the Appeals Office, Zuch challenged the IRS\u2019s \nrefusal to apply the estimated payments to her tax \nbill. The Appeals Office rejected her arguments. Zuch \nthen petitioned the Tax Court for review of the Ap-\npeals Office\u2019s determination\u2014including its resolution \nof the unpaid tax or underlying liability dispute. And \nthe Tax Court had jurisdiction under \u00a7 6330 to review \nthe determination of those issues.  \nB. Zuch\u2019s case wasn\u2019t mooted when the IRS de-\ncided that it no longer needed the levy. A case is moot \nonly if the parties no longer have a concrete interest \nin the outcome, and the court can\u2019t issue any relief \nthat would redress a party\u2019s injury. But here, the Tax \nCourt could issue a ruling deciding whether Zuch is \nentitled to have the $50,000 in estimated payments \napplied to her tax bill. So both parties have an interest \nhere. If Zuch prevails, the IRS is likely to issue a re-\nfund, and if the government prevails, the IRS will \nkeep her money. And win or lose, a judgment from the \nTax Court will be preclusive in the refund suit that \nZuch has now filed in the U.S. District Court for the \nDistrict of New Jersey. \n\n18 \n \n \nII. The government\u2019s counterarguments are un-\npersuasive.  \nA. The government claims that the Tax Court\u2019s \njurisdiction to review a taxpayer\u2019s liability challenge \nrequires a continuing attempt to levy the taxpayer\u2019s \nproperty. That is incorrect\u2014the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdic-\ntion didn\u2019t disappear once the IRS no longer needed \nthe levy. \n1. There is no textual basis for the government\u2019s \ncontinuing-levy requirement. To be sure, \u00a7 6330 men-\ntions the word \u201clevy\u201d\u2014after all, a taxpayer can initiate \nadministrative collection due process proceedings be-\nfore the Appeals Office only after being notified that \nthe IRS is going to levy her property. See I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(a)(3)(B), (b)(1). But once the Appeals Office is-\nsues a determination, the taxpayer can seek Tax \nCourt review of the determination under \u00a7 6330(d)(1). \nSection 6330(d)(1)\u2019s plain terms impose no continuing-\nlevy requirement, much less a \u201cclearly state[d]\u201d juris-\ndictional requirement, Boechler, 596 U.S. at 203. \nWhat\u2019s more, the presumption favoring judicial re-\nview of agency actions supports reading \u00a7 6330(d)(1) \nto confer jurisdiction even if the government abandons \nits levy efforts. See Guerrero-Lasprilla v. Barr, 589 \nU.S. 221, 229 (2020). In arguing otherwise, what the \nIRS is really saying is that, in its view, the Tax Court \ncannot redress a taxpayer\u2019s pocketbook injury when \nthere is no pending levy. But that\u2019s not the case, ei-\nther, as this case makes plain.  \n2. Section 6330\u2019s history and purpose confirm \nthat the Tax Court retains jurisdiction over an unpaid \ntax or liability challenge even after the IRS says it \ndoesn\u2019t need a levy anymore. Congress crafted \u00a7 6330 \nas remedial legislation in response to the IRS\u2019s \n\n19 \n \n \nabusive collection practices as part of a statutory \nscheme to increase fairness to taxpayers by allowing \nthem to challenge what they owe before they pay or \nhave their property seized. In light of that remedial \npurpose, \u00a7 6330 should be construed to mean what it \nsays\u2014the Tax Court has jurisdiction over the Appeals \nOffice\u2019s \u201cdetermination.\u201d \n3. Royal Canin doesn\u2019t suggest otherwise. The \ngovernment argues that the IRS fundamentally al-\ntered the basis of the suit when it decided not to seek \nthe levy. But the basis of the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction \nis the Appeals Office\u2019s determination, not any levy. \nAnd decisions holding that jurisdiction depends on the \nstate of play at the time the suit is brought show that \neven assuming \u00a7 6330 contains a pending-levy re-\nquirement, that requirement turns on the time of \nfiling and thus is met here: there was a levy pending \nwhen Zuch petitioned the Tax Court. \n4.  Policy can\u2019t salvage the government\u2019s position, \neither. The government claims that, if the Tax Court \nhas jurisdiction to review a taxpayer\u2019s liability in a \n\u00a7 6330 proceeding after the IRS determines it no \nlonger needs the levy, the floodgates will open and \n\u00a7 6330 proceedings will become a forum for all kinds \nof liability challenges. But the taxpayer may raise a \nliability issue in a collection due process proceeding \nonly when she did not have an earlier opportunity to \ndo so. Plus, the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction is tied to the \nissues raised before, and determined by, the Appeals \nOffice in the first place. There\u2019s no risk that the Tax \nCourt will begin exercising free-wheeling jurisdiction \nover \u201cgeneral\u201d liability disputes. What\u2019s more, the \nquestion presented rarely arises, and when it does, it\u2019s \nonly because of \u201cthe IRS\u2019s own recalcitrance.\u201d \nBoechler, 596 U.S. at 207. So even if there were a \n\n20 \n \n \nfloodgates problem, it would be the government\u2019s own \ndoing. \nB. The government claims that the Tax Court \nlacks authority to issue a judgment regarding Zuch\u2019s \nentitlement to the estimated payments. In the govern-\nment\u2019s view, the Tax Court can enjoin only a collection \naction in a \u00a7 6330 proceeding, and can\u2019t issue declara-\ntory relief at all. That argument is meritless. \nSection 6330(d)(1) authorizes the Tax Court to deter-\nmine the taxpayer\u2019s unpaid tax and underlying \nliability, and issue a judgment about those issues. And \n\u00a7 6330(e)(1), which allows injunctions \u201cin respect of \nthe unpaid tax or proposed levy,\u201d confirms that the \nTax Court can issue declaratory relief determining a \ntaxpayer\u2019s rights in a challenge involving her liability \nor unpaid tax. The DJA doesn\u2019t provide otherwise, be-\ncause \u00a7 6330(e)(1) exempts \u00a7 6330 from the DJA\u2019s \nprohibition on declaratory relief in most tax cases.  \nC. The government\u2019s other mootness arguments \nfail, too. The government contends that the case is \nmoot because, once the IRS decides not to pursue a \nlevy, \u201cthe issue that prompted the Section 6330 pro-\nceeding is no longer \u2018live.\u2019\u201d Br. 21. But the mootness \ninquiry asks whether the parties retain any interest \nin the outcome of the litigation, and thus whether the \ncourt can redress the plaintiff\u2019s injury. The parties \nhave a concrete interest here, because the Tax Court \ncan decide whether Zuch or the IRS is entitled to the \nmoney.  \nD. Finally, the government mentions in a foot-\nnote that Zuch\u2019s challenge relates to her unpaid tax, \nrather than her underlying liability. But the govern-\nment concedes (Br. 25 n.3) that the dispute is \n\n21 \n \n \nimmaterial. Indeed, as Zuch has explained, the Tax \nCourt had, and retained, jurisdiction either way. \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe Tax Court had jurisdiction under I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330 to review and rule on Zuch\u2019s unpaid \ntax or tax liability, so the case isn\u2019t moot. \nA. The Tax Court had jurisdiction to review \nthe Appeals Office\u2019s determination of \nZuch\u2019s entitlement to the estimated \npayments. \nSection 6330\u2019s text and context make clear that \nthe Tax Court had jurisdiction to review Zuch\u2019s chal-\nlenge to her unpaid tax or underlying tax liability, \neven after the IRS stopped pursuing the levy. \n1. Section 6330\u2019s plain text states that \nthe Tax Court has jurisdiction to \nreview \nthe \nAppeals \nOffice\u2019s \n\u201cdetermination\u201d \nof \na \ntaxpayer\u2019s \nchallenge to \u201cany relevant issue \nrelating to [her] unpaid tax\u201d or her \n\u201cunderlying liability.\u201d  \na. During the collection due process hearing, the \nAppeals Office can determine \u201cany relevant issue re-\nlating to the unpaid tax,\u201d and, if the taxpayer \u201cdid not \nreceive any statutory notice of deficiency \u2026 or did not \notherwise have an opportunity to dispute\u201d it, the tax-\npayer may also challenge \u201cthe existence or amount of \nthe underlying tax liability.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2). A tax-\npayer challenges her underlying tax liability by \ndisputing \u201cthe amounts that the Commissioner as-\nsessed for a particular tax period.\u201d Jeffers v. \nCommissioner, 992 F.3d 649, 653 n.4 (7th Cir. 2021); \naccord Montgomery, 122 T.C. at 7-8. For example, the \n\n22 \n \n \ntaxpayer challenges her underlying tax liability when \nshe claims that the IRS misapplied a credit, if properly \napplying the credit \u201cwould eliminate the outstanding \ntax liability.\u201d Peoplease, LLC v. Commissioner, \nNo. 2161-24L, 2025 WL 429626, at *2 (T.C. Feb. 6, \n2025). Similarly, when a taxpayer raises challenges \nrelating to the unpaid portion of the underlying tax \nliability, she raises an issue related to the unpaid tax. \nSee Internal Revenue Service Chief Counsel Notice \nCC-2014-002 at 3 (May 5, 2014) (\u201c\u2018Unpaid tax\u2019 refers \nto that part of the underlying tax liability not paid by \nthe taxpayer.\u201d).  \nOnce the Appeals Office issues a determination, \nthe taxpayer may \u201cpetition the Tax Court for review \nof [the Appeals Office\u2019s] determination,\u201d \u201cand the Tax \nCourt shall have jurisdiction with respect to such mat-\nter.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). That means the Tax Court \nreviews the \u201cdetermination\u201d of all \u201cthe issues\u201d raised \nduring the hearing. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2), (c)(3)(B). So \nwhen the Tax Court reviews the Appeals Office\u2019s de-\ntermination, it can resolve any dispute about any \nissue relating to the unpaid tax or the taxpayer\u2019s un-\nderlying tax liability that the taxpayer properly raised \nbefore the Appeals Office. See id. \nb. The Tax Court doesn\u2019t lose its jurisdiction to \nresolve a challenge to the Appeals Office determina-\ntion just because the IRS decides to stop pursuing the \nlevy. Congress provided that the Tax Court \u201cshall \nhave jurisdiction\u201d to review the Appeals Office\u2019s deter-\nmination. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1) (emphasis added). That \nreview necessarily reaches all live \u201cissues\u201d involved in \nthe Appeal\u2019s Office\u2019s determination. And those issues \nexpressly include, as relevant here, \u201cany relevant is-\nsue relating to the unpaid tax\u201d and any \u201cchallenges to \nthe existence or amount of the underlying tax \n\n23 \n \n \nliability,\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2), (c)(3)(B). So long as an \nunpaid tax or liability issue remains disputed, nothing \nin \u00a7 6330 suggests the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to re-\nview the question vanishes when the IRS collects the \namount due another way and no longer needs the levy. \nAt most, whether there is a pending levy could affect \nwhat kind of relief the Tax Court can grant. But it \ndoesn\u2019t present any question about jurisdiction under \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1). As explained below (at 28-29), the Tax \nCourt can rule on a taxpayer\u2019s unpaid tax or underly-\ning liability when there are live disputes about those \nissues. \nc. Section 6330\u2019s history confirms that Congress \ndeliberately vested the Tax Court with jurisdiction to \nresolve disputes over a taxpayer\u2019s underlying liability \nand wanted the Tax Court to retain that jurisdiction. \nBefore 2006, \u00a7 6330 provided that taxpayers could \nseek review of the Appeals Office\u2019s determination in \nfederal district court \u201cif the Tax Court [did] not have \njurisdiction of the underlying tax liability.\u201d I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1) (2000). Practically, that language meant \nthat the Tax Court had jurisdiction to review the Ap-\npeals Office\u2019s determination of a liability dispute only \nif the dispute concerned income, estate, or gift taxes, \nbecause the Tax Court already had jurisdiction to re-\nview those kinds of disputes in deficiency proceedings. \nMoore v. Commissioner, 114 T.C. 171, 175 (2000). But \nCongress changed that in 2006 and made clear that \nthe Tax Court \u201cshall\u201d review the taxpayer\u2019s disputed \nliability in all cases. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). Thus, Con-\ngress ensured that \u201cthe Tax Court [has] jurisdiction \nover issues arising from a collection due process hear-\ning\u201d by \u201cconsolidat[ing] all judicial review of \u2026 \ncollection due process determinations,\u201d including a \ntaxpayer\u2019s underlying tax liability, in the Tax Court. \n\n24 \n \n \nStaff of J. Comm. on Taxation, 109th Cong., Descrip-\ntion of the Revenue Provisions Contained in the \nPresident\u2019s Fiscal Year 2007 Budget Proposal 230-31 \n(Comm. Print 2006); accord Staff of J. Comm. On Tax-\nation, 109th Cong., Technical Explanation of H.R. 4, \nThe \u201cPension Protection Act of 2006,\u201d as Passed By the \nHouse on July 28, 2006, and as Considered by the Sen-\nate on August 3, 2006 (Comm. Print. 2006). \n2. Statutory \ncontext \nconfirms \nthat \nCongress \ngave \nthe \nTax \nCourt \ncontinuing jurisdiction to resolve \nissues relating to the unpaid tax and \ntax liability disputes. \nStatutory context shows why Congress likely gave \nthe Tax Court authority to review the issues underly-\ning the Appeals Office\u2019s determination. \nAs noted (at 6-7), in some circumstances, the IRS \nissues a notice of deficiency to a taxpayer, who can \nthen challenge her assessed liability in Tax Court be-\nfore the IRS collects. See I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6212(a), 6512(a). \nBut sometimes the taxpayer doesn\u2019t receive a notice of \ndeficiency or have another opportunity to dispute the \nliability before the IRS seeks to levy the taxpayer\u2019s \nproperty, as in Zuch\u2019s case. See I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B). \nTo ensure that taxpayers have that opportunity, Con-\ngress gave taxpayers the right to dispute their \nliability. Id. Similarly, Congress gave taxpayers the \nright to raise \u201cany relevant issue relating to the un-\npaid tax,\u201d no matter whether they received a notice of \ndeficiency or otherwise had the opportunity to chal-\nlenge the liability. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A). And \nCongress directed the Appeals Office and Tax Court to \nresolve those challenges. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(3), (d)(1). \n\n25 \n \n \nEven if the IRS is able to terminate the levy after \nthe taxpayer initiates \u00a7 6330 proceedings, it makes \nsense for the Tax Court to finish resolving the unpaid \ntax or underlying liability dispute if it remains live. \nAfter all, if the dispute continues past the levy, closing \nthe Tax Court\u2019s doors would simply require the tax-\npayer to file another lawsuit, this time seeking a \nrefund under I.R.C. \u00a7 7422 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(a)(1). \nAnd that would undermine the \u201cdesign[]\u201d of the Tax \nCode \u201cto insure an orderly administration of the reve-\nnue.\u2019\u201d United States v. Clintwood Elkhorn Mining Co., \n553 U.S. 1, 11 (2008). It also would contravene the \ngovernment\u2019s fundamental obligation to \u201cturn square \ncorners in dealing with the people,\u201d Regents of the Uni-\nversity of California, 591 U.S. at 24, by pulling the rug \nout from under a taxpayer who has been litigating \nagainst the IRS for years and forcing her to start new \nlitigation in a different forum.  \nCongress passed \u00a7 6330 to avoid heavy-handed \nIRS tactics, not authorize them in the form of jurisdic-\ntional gamesmanship. And in what is known as the \nTaxpayer Bill of Rights, Congress has also instructed \nthe IRS to \u201censure that employees of the Internal Rev-\nenue Service are familiar with and act in accord with \ntaxpayer rights as afforded by other provisions of this \ntitle.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 7803(a)(3); see Taxpayer Bill of Rights, \nIRS, https://www.irs.gov/taxpayer-bill-of-rights (last \nvisited March 17, 2025). Those rights include \u201cthe \nright to pay no more than the correct amount of tax\u201d; \n\u201cthe right to challenge the position of the Internal \nRevenue Service and be heard\u201d; \u201cthe right to appeal a \ndecision of the Internal Revenue Service in an inde-\npendent forum\u201d; and \u201cthe right to finality.\u201d I.R.C. \n\u00a7 7803(a)(3)(C)-(F). Those rights underscore that the \nTax Court\u2019s jurisdiction under \u00a7 6330 does not vanish \n\n26 \n \n \njust because the IRS seeks to cut off the taxpayer\u2019s \nrights to challenge the agency\u2019s position. By the same \ntoken, nothing in I.R.C. \u00a7 6402, which governs offsets, \npurports to limit the Tax Court\u2019s authority to deter-\nmine the taxpayer\u2019s unpaid tax or liability under \n\u00a7 6330, and reading the provisions that way would in-\nsert words into the statute and contravene the \nTaxpayer Bill of Rights.  \n3. The Tax Court had jurisdiction under \n\u00a7 6330 to review the Appeals Office\u2019s \ndetermination, \nincluding \nits \nresolution of Zuch\u2019s entitlement to \nthe estimated payments. \nThe Tax Court had jurisdiction under \u00a7 6330 to re-\nview the Appeals Office\u2019s determination that Zuch \nwas not entitled to the estimated payments. \nZuch challenged the IRS\u2019s allocation of the esti-\nmated tax payments in the collection due process \nproceedings. In particular, she claimed that she did \nnot owe the IRS the $27,682 for the 2010 tax year be-\ncause the estimated payments should have been \ncredited to her. Pet. App. 9a; see Jeffers, 992 F.3d at \n653 n.4; Peoplease, 2025 WL 429626, at *2. Zuch had \na right to dispute that liability (or unpaid tax, if the \nIRS would prefer to classify it that way). Zuch did not \nreceive a notice of deficiency or otherwise have an op-\nportunity to challenge her claimed liability. Pet. \nApp. 10a. Regardless, Zuch was also entitled to raise \nher challenge as a \u201crelevant issue relating to the un-\npaid tax.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A).  \nAfter the Appeals Office made its determination, \nZuch timely petitioned the Tax Court for review. CA3 \nApp. A24-A30; see CA3 App. A266-270; Pet. App. 41a-\n42a. The Tax Court then had jurisdiction over the \n\n27 \n \n \nAppeals Office\u2019s decision, including the dispute over \nthe estimated payments. See I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2), \n(c)(3)(B), (d)(1). \nTo be sure, while the case was before the Tax \nCourt\u2014and after more than six years of litigation\u2014\nthe IRS announced that it was abandoning the levy. \nBut that didn\u2019t deprive the Tax Court of jurisdiction \nunder \u00a7 6330. Nothing in \u00a7 6330 purports to condition \nthe Tax Court\u2019s ongoing jurisdiction on the IRS\u2019s con-\ntinued pursuit of a levy. \nB. Zuch\u2019s case did not become moot when \nthe IRS decided to stop pursuing the \nlevy, because the parties disputed, and \nthe \nTax \nCourt \nhad \nthe \npower \nto \nadjudicate, Zuch\u2019s entitlement to the \nestimated payments. \nZuch\u2019s case isn\u2019t moot just because the IRS de-\ncided it no longer needed a levy. Mootness comes into \nplay only when the parties no longer have a concrete \ninterest in the outcome. But both Zuch and the IRS \nhave a concrete interest here because the Tax Court \ncan still decide Zuch\u2019s challenge to the Appeals Of-\nfice\u2019s \nunderlying \nliability \nor \nunpaid \ntax \ndeterminations and then rule that Zuch is entitled to \nthe estimated payments. If the Tax Court so rules, the \nIRS is likely to abide by that ruling and issue a refund. \nBut even if the IRS doesn\u2019t issue a refund, the Tax \nCourt\u2019s judgment would be preclusive in the refund \naction Zuch has brought in the District of New Jersey.  \n\n28 \n \n \n1. A case becomes moot only when the \nparties no longer have a concrete \ninterest \nin \nthe outcome \nof the \nlitigation and judicial relief is not \nlikely to redress any injury.  \nThe mootness inquiry asks whether standing \u201cex-\nists throughout the proceedings.\u201d Uzuegbunam v. \nPreczewski, 592 U.S. 279, 282 (2021). The \u201cirreducible \nconstitutional minimum of standing contains three el-\nements\u201d: \n(1) injury \nin \nfact, \n(2) causation \n(i.e., \ntraceability), and (3) redressability. Lujan v. Defend-\ners of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992). \u201cAs long \nas the parties have a concrete interest, however small, \nin the outcome of the litigation, the case is not moot.\u201d \nCampbell-Ewald Co. v. Gomez, 577 U.S. 153, 161 \n(2016). Thus, redressability requires only that judicial \nrelief \u201clikely\u201d will redress an injury, Federal Election \nCommission v. Cruz, 596 U.S. 289, 296 (2022), not \nthat \u201ca favorable decision will relieve\u201d \u201cevery injury,\u201d \nLarson v. Valente, 456 U.S. 228, 243-44 & n.15 (1982) \n(first emphasis added).  \n2. Zuch\u2019s challenge isn\u2019t moot because a \nfavorable \nTax \nCourt \nruling \non \nunderlying liability or unpaid tax \nwould likely redress her pocketbook \ninjury. \nZuch satisfies all three requirements of standing. \nShe suffered a concrete injury when the IRS applied \nthe $50,000 in estimated payments to her ex-hus-\nband\u2019s balance, rather than her own. See, e.g., \nTransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413, 425 \n(2021). If the IRS had applied the estimated payments \nto Zuch\u2019s account\u2014as both she and her ex-husband \nhad \nrequested\u2014Zuch \nwould \nhave \ngotten \nher \n\n29 \n \n \noverpayments back in later years. But, having refused \nto apply the estimated payments to Zuch\u2019s tax bill, the \nIRS kept her overpayments instead. Zuch\u2019s monetary \ninjury is thus traceable to the IRS\u2019s refusal to apply \nthe $50,000 in estimated payments to her 2010 tax \nbill. See Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Or-\nganization, 426 U.S. 26, 41-42 (1976). And the Tax \nCourt can redress Zuch\u2019s injury by ruling that the Ap-\npeals Office was wrong about her liability or unpaid \ntax and thus determining that Zuch is entitled to the \n$50,000 in estimated payments. \nAs noted, the Appeals Office\u2019s \u201cdetermination\u201d \n\u201cshall take into consideration\u201d \u201cthe issues raised\u201d at \nthe hearing, I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(3)(B), including \u201cany rel-\nevant issue relating to the unpaid tax\u201d and \u201cthe \nexistence or amount of the underlying tax liability,\u201d \nI.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2). And because the Tax Court \u201cshall \nhave jurisdiction\u201d to review \u201csuch determination,\u201d \nI.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1), the Tax Court can decide a tax-\npayer\u2019s unpaid tax or underlying tax liability, too. \nAccord Michael I. Saltzman & Leslie Book, IRS Prac-\ntice & Procedure \u00a7 14B.16[4][a] (updated Oct. 2024). \nIn Zuch\u2019s case, that means the Tax Court can rule on \nwhether she is entitled to credit for the estimated pay-\nments, underscoring both parties\u2019 concrete interest in \nthe outcome of the case. See Pet. App. 33a-34a, 42a. \nIf the Tax Court rules that Zuch is entitled to the \nestimated payments, the IRS is likely to issue Zuch a \nrefund. That\u2019s because \u201cit is substantially likely that \n[the IRS] would abide by\u201d that \u201cauthoritative\u201d holding \n\u201cby the [Tax] Court.\u201d Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 \nU.S. 788, 803 (1992); accord Reed v. Goertz, 598 U.S. \n230, 234 (2023); Pet. App. 38a. Indeed, it would be \nquite remarkable for the IRS to simply ignore the Tax \nCourt and decide not to return to Zuch the money that \n\n30 \n \n \na court has determined the IRS has no legal right to \nkeep. That is especially true because the Tax Court \nnot only has authority to review and rule on the un-\nderlying \nliability \nand \nunpaid \ntax \nissues \nin \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1), but it also has authority to put those rul-\nings into a declaratory judgment under \u00a7 6330(e), as \nexplained below (at 40-42). The consequence is that \nthe Tax Court will have \u201c\u2018ordered a change in a legal \nstatus,\u2019 and \u2018the practical consequence of that change \nwould amount to a significant increase in the likeli-\nhood\u2019\u201d that the IRS will give Zuch her money back. \nReed, 598 U.S. at 234. The Tax Court\u2019s authority to \nissue a \u201cdefinitive determination of the legal rights of \nthe parties,\u201d Medtronic, Inc. v. Mirowski Family Ven-\ntures, LLC, 571 U.S. 191, 200 (2014); see Haaland v. \nBrackeen, 599 U.S. 255, 293 (2023), leaves no doubt \nthat the court has the power to grant effective relief. \nEven if the IRS doesn\u2019t issue Zuch a refund, Zuch \nhas filed a refund suit in the District of New Jersey \nunder I.R.C. \u00a7 7422, and the Tax Court\u2019s ruling would \nhave preclusive effect in that suit. \u201cUnder the doctrine \nof issue preclusion, \u2018a prior judgment forecloses suc-\ncessive litigation of an issue of fact or law actually \nlitigated and resolved in a valid court determination \nessential to the prior judgment.\u2019\u201d Herrera v. Wyoming, \n587 U.S. 329, 342 (2019) (alterations adopted). \u201cThe \nidea is straightforward: Once a court has decided an \nissue, it is \u2018forever settled as between the parties.\u2019\u201d \nB&B Hardware, Inc. v. Hargis Industries, Inc., 575 \nU.S. 138, 147 (2015). That goes for declaratory relief \nissued in an earlier case, too. E.g., 18 Charles A. \nWright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Pro-\ncedure \u00a7 4421 (3d ed. updated June 2024). And the \ndoctrine applies \u201ceven if the issue recurs in the context \n\n31 \n \n \nof a different claim.\u201d Taylor v. Sturgell, 553 U.S. 880, \n892 (2008). \nHere, Zuch\u2019s entitlement to the estimated pay-\nments is an \u201cissue of \u2026 law\u201d that would be \u201cactually \nlitigated and resolved\u201d in the Tax Court proceeding \nand \u201cessential to\u201d the Tax Court\u2019s decision on Zuch\u2019s \nunpaid tax or underlying liability. Herrera, 587 U.S. \nat 342. Thus, the Tax Court\u2019s judgment would be pre-\nclusive in the refund suit Zuch has recently filed in the \nDistrict of New Jersey, and that court likely would or-\nder the government to issue a refund. See, e.g., \nParklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 U.S. 322, 325, 332-\n33 (1979). \nII. The IRS\u2019s counterarguments lack merit. \nA. The Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to review \nwhether Zuch was entitled to the \nprepayments didn\u2019t dissolve once the \nIRS no longer needed the levy. \nThe government claims (Br. 16-21), that the Tax \nCourt has jurisdiction under \u00a7 6330 to review a tax-\npayer\u2019s liability only if the IRS continues threatening \nto levy the taxpayer\u2019s property. In the government\u2019s \nview, \u00a7 6330\u2019s text, history, and \u201cfunction\u201d show that \n\u00a7 6330 focuses only on whether a levy can proceed, and \nthe Tax Court thus lacks jurisdiction when the IRS \ndecides it no longer needs a levy. The government also \nwarns that allowing the Tax Court to review live dis-\nputes about unpaid tax or taxpayer liability when no \nlevy is pending would vastly expand Tax Court juris-\ndiction. Those arguments fail. Section 6330\u2019s text, \nhistory, and remedial purpose, plus time-of-filing \nrules in other contexts, all confirm that the Tax Court \nretains jurisdiction under \u00a7 6330 to review a tax-\npayer\u2019s unpaid tax or underlying liability, even when \n\n32 \n \n \nthe IRS abandons its levy. And the government\u2019s pol-\nicy concern is meritless. \n1. There is no textual basis in \u00a7 6330 for \nthe \ngovernment\u2019s \ncontinuing-levy \nrequirement. \na. The government contends that without a \nthreatened levy, there is nothing for the \u201cunderlying \ntax liability\u201d to \u201cunderlie.\u201d Br. 26. So by implication, \nthe government claims, \u00a7 6330 jurisdiction turns on a \nthreatened levy. Br. 24-27. That argument fails. \nSection 6330(d)(1) makes clear that the Tax Court \nhas jurisdiction in \u00a7 6330 proceedings to review the \nAppeals Office\u2019s determination of the issues raised in \na collection due process hearing. Supra pp. 21-23. It \nsays that \u201cthe Tax Court shall have jurisdiction\u201d to re-\nview the Appeals Office\u2019s \u201cdetermination\u201d\u2014which \nincludes all the issues the Appeals Office was required \nto consider during the hearing, not just whether the \nlevy can proceed. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1); see I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(c)(2), (c)(3)(B). The \u201cunderlying liability\u201d lan-\nguage appears in the provisions of \u00a7 6330 listing the \nmatters a taxpayer may raise at the collection due pro-\ncess hearing. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B). The Appeals \nOffice\u2019s determination thus triggers the Tax Court\u2019s \njurisdiction under \u00a7 6330, and the IRS\u2019s actions after \nthe Appeals Office issues the determination have no \nbearing on that jurisdiction. \nWhat\u2019s more, even assuming the phrase \u201cunderly-\ning tax liability\u201d implies that there must be a proposed \nlevy at the outset of the collection due process hearing \n(and there was here), nothing in \u00a7 6330 conditions the \nTax Court\u2019s exercise of \u00a7 6330 jurisdiction on the IRS\u2019s \ncontinued pursuit of a levy. To the contrary, \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1) refers to the Tax Court\u2019s review of a \n\n33 \n \n \n\u201cdetermination\u201d by the Appeals Office. And even if \n\u00a7 6330 required a pending levy at the outset of Tax \nCourt proceedings, that requirement would be satis-\nfied because there was a threatened levy pending \nwhen Zuch petitioned the Tax Court. Infra pp. 38-39. \nThat makes sense. Zuch continues to be aggrieved by \nthe Appeals Office\u2019s determination upholding the \nIRS\u2019s liability assessment, even though the IRS claims \nit no longer needs the levy. \nViewing Zuch\u2019s challenge as one \u201crelating to the \nunpaid tax\u201d doesn\u2019t mean the Tax Court lost jurisdic-\ntion to review the dispute, either. That\u2019s because the \n$27,682 the IRS claims Zuch owed for the 2010 tax \nyear was \u201cunpaid\u201d when she petitioned the Tax Court \nin 2014. See Pet. App. 11a. \nb. The government also claims that the text of \n\u00a7 6330 is \u201cnarrowly focused\u201d on \u201cwhether the IRS may \ngo forward with its proposed levy,\u201d from the title for \nthe section to the provisions describing the beginning \nof collection due process proceedings and granting the \nTax Court jurisdiction. Br. 17; see Br. 17-20. Not so. \nFor starters, the title of a provision is \u201cnot meant \nto take the place of the detailed provisions of the text\u201d; \nnor is it \u201cnecessarily designed to be a reference guide \nor a synopsis.\u201d Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. \nBaltimore & Ohio Railroad Co., 331 U.S. 519, 528 \n(1947). What\u2019s more, even though a taxpayer can ini-\ntiate collection due process proceedings with the \nAppeals Office when the IRS seeks to levy, see I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(a)(1), the provisions that authorize the Tax \nCourt to review a taxpayer\u2019s liability challenge\u2014\n\u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B) and (d)(1)\u2014do not \u201cfocus[] on\u201d a levy. \nSection 6330(c)(2)(B), for instance, allows taxpayers in \nsome situations to \u201craise at the hearing challenges to \n\n34 \n \n \nthe existence or amount of the underlying tax liabil-\nity.\u201d And \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A) differentiates \u201crelevant \nissue[s] relating to the unpaid tax\u201d from issues about \n\u201cthe proposed levy.\u201d Section 6330(d)(1), moreover, \nstates that the taxpayer may \u201cpetition the Tax Court \nfor review of such determination (and the Tax Court \nshall have jurisdiction with respect to such matter).\u201d \nNo continuing-levy requirement there. \nc. Next, the government says that \u00a7 6330(d)(1)\u2019s \nreference to the Appeals Office\u2019s \u201cdetermination\u201d im-\nplies that Tax Court jurisdiction hinges on a \nthreatened levy because the \u201cdetermination\u201d is about \nonly \u201cwhether the levy may go forward.\u201d Br. 19-20. \nThat\u2019s wrong, too. Section 6330(d)(1) authorizes the \nTax Court to review that \u201cdetermination,\u201d which nec-\nessarily involves reviewing the Appeals Office\u2019s \nresolution of each issue raised at the collection due \nprocess hearing. Supra pp. 21-23. That includes, \nwhere relevant, the taxpayer\u2019s unpaid tax or underly-\ning liability, see I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2), (c)(3)(B)\u2014\ndeterminations, as this very case shows, with signifi-\ncance beyond whether a levy may proceed. Those \nrulings determine who keeps the money both parties \nclaim is legally theirs. And as the government admits \n(Br. 19-20), the Tax Court\u2019s resolution of those issues \nis part and parcel of the determination. Nothing in \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1) conditions the Tax Court\u2019s review of that \ndetermination\u2014and all the issues it resolves\u2014on a \ncontinuing levy. \nd. The government\u2019s atextual continuing-levy re-\nquirement fails for another reason: \u201cthe presumption \nfavoring judicial review of administrative action,\u201d \nGuerrero-Lasprilla, 589 U.S. at 229, weighs in favor of \nTax Court jurisdiction. The \u201cstrong presumption\u201d of \njudicial review directs that \u201cwhen a statutory \n\n35 \n \n \nprovision \u2018is reasonably susceptible to divergent inter-\npretation,\u2019\u201d courts must \u201cadopt the reading that \naccords with traditional understandings and basic \nprinciples: that executive determinations generally \nare subject to judicial review.\u201d Id. And where applica-\nble, the \u201cpresumption can only be overcome by \u2018clear \nand convincing evidence\u2019 of congressional intent to \npreclude judicial review.\u201d Id. Those principles also \nalign with this Court\u2019s recent recognition in the \u00a7 6330 \ncontext that jurisdictional requirements must be \n\u201cclearly state[d].\u201d Boechler, 596 U.S. at 203. \nHere, \u00a7 6330 is susceptible to one interpretation: \nthe Tax Court retains jurisdiction to review a deter-\nmination even if the IRS says it no longer needs the \nlevy. Supra pp. 21-26. Section 6330(d)(1) doesn\u2019t men-\ntion levies, much less contain a clear continuing-levy \nrequirement. But even if another reasonable interpre-\ntation were possible, it is far from clear that Congress \nintended to insulate the Appeals Office\u2019s unpaid tax \nand liability determinations when the IRS stops pur-\nsuing a levy. See Pet. Br. 34. \nThe presumption doesn\u2019t become irrelevant here \njust because Zuch can file a refund suit and obtain ju-\ndicial review of her entitlement to the estimated \npayments that way, as the government contends (id.). \nThe \u201cadministrative action\u201d at issue here is the Ap-\npeals Office\u2019s determination. Guerrero-Lasprilla, 589 \nU.S. at 229. So the question is whether that determi-\nnation is reviewable in the Tax Court under \u00a7 6330\u2014\nnot whether Zuch may obtain review of another ac-\ntion, in a different court, and under a different Code \nprovision. The presumption applies in answering the \nformer question. And the answer is that the Tax Court \nretains jurisdiction. \n\n36 \n \n \n2. The \ngovernment \nmisconstrues \n\u00a7 6330\u2019s history and downplays its \nremedial \npurpose, \nwhich \nboth \nsupport \nthe \nTax \nCourt\u2019s \n\u00a7 6330 \njurisdiction to review unpaid tax and \nliability disputes even if the IRS no \nlonger pursues the levy. \nThe government claims (Br. 22-23) that because \nCongress added \u00a7 6330 in 1998 to allow taxpayers to \nchallenge levies before the IRS seized their property, \nthat somehow shows that the Tax Court has jurisdic-\ntion only if a levy is pending. But that argument \ncannot trump plain text. And in any event, \u00a7 6330\u2019s \nhistory and purpose confirm that Congress wanted \nthe Tax Court to retain jurisdiction over a live unpaid \ntax or liability dispute even if the IRS no longer needs \na levy. \nCongress enacted \u00a7 6330 to protect taxpayers from \nthe IRS\u2019s abusive collection practices and to rein in the \nIRS\u2019s unchecked power to act as \u201cjudge, jury, and exe-\ncutioner, answerable to none.\u201d Hearings Before the \nCommittee on Finance at 56, 82; see supra pp. 9-10. \nAnd in designing \u00a7 6330\u2019s scheme, Congress sought to \n\u201censure that all taxpayers have due process and that \nthe IRS does not abusively use its liens-and-seizure \nauthority.\u201d 143 Cong. Rec. S12231 (statement of Sen. \nRoth). Indeed, the point of \u00a7 6330 proceedings is to \u201cin-\ncrease fairness to taxpayers\u201d before the IRS deprives \nthem of their property. S. Rep. No. 105-174, at 67; ac-\ncord Katz v. Commissioner, 115 T.C. 329, 333 n.8 \n(2000) (explaining that Congress enacted \u00a7 6330 \u201cto \nprovide new protections for taxpayers\u201d). \nSection 6330 did just that. It gave taxpayers a \nchance to challenge their liability before paying it \n\n37 \n \n \nwhen the taxpayer did not already have an oppor-\ntunity to challenge the liability, and ensured \ntaxpayers may always raise \u201cany relevant issue relat-\ning to the unpaid tax.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2). Section \n6330 thus gave taxpayers an opportunity for IRS Ap-\npeals to reach a \u201cdetermination\u201d on their unpaid tax \nor liability, and granted taxpayers the right \u201cto peti-\ntion the Tax Court to contest the Appeals [Office\u2019s] \ndecision,\u201d 144 Cong. Rec. S4494 (statement of Sen. \nHatch). Put simply, history shows that Congress did \nnot intend to enable the IRS to unilaterally deprive \nthe Tax Court of jurisdiction to review unpaid tax or \nliability disputes by finding another way to take the \ntaxpayer\u2019s money and then claiming it no longer seeks \nthe levy. And given \u00a7 6330\u2019s history, the Court should \nconstrue the statute \u201cbroadly to effectuate its pur-\nposes.\u201d Tcherepnin v. Knight, 389 U.S. 332, 336 (1967); \nsee Piedmont & Northern Railway. v. Interstate Com-\nmerce Commission, 286 U.S. 299, 311 (1932). \n3. Royal \nCanin \ndoesn\u2019t \nhelp \nthe \ngovernment. \nPointing to this Court\u2019s decision in Royal Canin, \nthe government argues that \u00a7 6330 contains a contin-\nuing-levy requirement because the IRS \u201calter[s]\u201d \n\u201c[t]he fundamental basis\u201d of the suit when it decides \nto no longer seek the levy. Br. 29-31. That argument \nfails. \nIn Royal Canin, the Court held that, if a plaintiff \namends her complaint to \u201celiminate[] the federal-law \nclaims that enabled removal, leaving only state-law \nclaims behind, the court\u2019s power to decide the dispute \ndissolves.\u201d 604 U.S. at 30. That makes sense, given the \nbasic idea that \u201c[i]f a plaintiff amends her complaint, \nthe new pleading \u2018supersedes\u2019 the old one.\u201d Id. at 35 \n\n38 \n \n \n(citing 6 Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice \nand Procedure \u00a7 1476 (3d ed. 2010)). And in Royal \nCanin, the plaintiff altered the basis for the federal \ncourt\u2019s federal question jurisdiction by amending her \ncomplaint to withdraw her federal claims.  \nNone of those principles shows that the Tax Court \nlost jurisdiction under \u00a7 6330 to review the Appeals \nOffice\u2019s determination when the IRS stopped pursuing \nthe levy. The basis of the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction un-\nder \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1) \nis \nthe \nAppeals \nOffice\u2019s \ndetermination\u2014not the proposed levy. The IRS did \nnot change the basis of the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction by \ndropping the levy, because once the Appeals Office is-\nsues a \u201cdetermination,\u201d the Tax Court has jurisdiction \nto review it. See I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1) (\u201cthe Tax Court \nshall have jurisdiction\u201d to \u201creview\u201d the \u201cdetermina-\ntion\u201d). And unlike the plaintiff in Royal Canin, Zuch \ndidn\u2019t file an amended pleading changing the basis of \nthe Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction. When Zuch filed her Tax \nCourt petition, she challenged the Appeals Office\u2019s de-\ntermination that she was not entitled to the estimated \npayments. That\u2019s still her challenge today, and the \nIRS\u2019s decision to stop pursuing the levy is irrelevant.  \nBut even assuming the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction \nunder \u00a7 6330 was somehow contingent on a levy, time-\nof-filing rules show that any levy requirement was \nmet because there was a pending levy when Zuch pe-\ntitioned the Tax Court. Time-of-filing rules generally \nprovide that jurisdiction \u201cdepends upon the state of \nthings at the time\u201d the plaintiff brings the action, \nGrupo Dataflux v. Atlas Global Group, L.P., 541 U.S. \n567, 570 (2004); see, e.g., Conolly v. Taylor, 27 U.S. (2 \nPet.) 556, 565 (1829)\u2014here, when the taxpayer peti-\ntions the Tax Court. So, if \u00a7 6330 did require a pending \nlevy, that levy requirement would be assessed at the \n\n39 \n \n \ntime the taxpayer files her Tax Court petition. And \nhere, there was a pending levy when Zuch petitioned \nthe Tax Court. Pet. App. 11a, 13a. The IRS\u2019s decision \nto stop pursuing the levy thus does not destroy the Tax \nCourt\u2019s jurisdiction to review the Appeals Office\u2019s de-\ntermination, even if \u00a7 6330 contains a levy-based \njurisdictional requirement. \n4. The government\u2019s policy argument is \nmeritless. \nThe government claims that, if it cannot deprive \nthe Tax Court of jurisdiction to review a liability chal-\nlenge by no longer seeking the levy, \u00a7 6330 will turn \ninto a \u201cgeneral forum for considering challenges to tax \nliability.\u201d Br. 24. That argument lacks merit. \nThere\u2019s no risk of the Tax Court wading into gen-\neral liability determinations in \u00a7 6330 proceedings. \nSection 6330 specifies the issues taxpayers may raise \nin \ncollection \ndue \nprocess \nhearings. \nI.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A). And only taxpayers who did not have \nan earlier opportunity to challenge their assessed lia-\nbility can challenge that claimed liability in collection \ndue process proceedings. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B). The \nTax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to review the taxpayer\u2019s lia-\nbility (or issue relating to the unpaid tax), in turn, is \ntied to the Appeals Office\u2019s liability determination. \nI.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). The sky isn\u2019t falling, and the gov-\nernment hasn\u2019t pointed to any \u00a7 6330 cases pending \nbefore the Appeals Office or the Tax Court that would \nsuggest otherwise. \nWhat\u2019s more, the question presented in this case \narises rarely, and when it does, it\u2019s only as a result of \n\u201cthe IRS\u2019s own recalcitrance.\u201d Boechler, 596 U.S. at \n207. The question arises only when the IRS initiates a \nlevy, but during \u00a7 6330 proceedings, finds a way to \n\n40 \n \n \ntake the taxpayer\u2019s money another way, and drops the \nlevy during the Tax Court\u2019s review. But there\u2019s no rea-\nson to think the issue comes up with any frequency. \nB. The Tax Court\u2019s authority is not limited \nto approving or rejecting a proposed \nlevy, but includes the power to issue \nbinding judgments. \nThe government argues that the Tax Court \ndoesn\u2019t have the power to declare Zuch\u2019s entitlement \nto the estimated payments. In the government\u2019s view, \n\u00a7 6330 doesn\u2019t authorize that relief, the DJA\u2019s prohi-\nbition on declaratory relief in most tax cases bars \nbinding relief here, and \u00a7 6330 is a \u201climited mecha-\nnism\u201d for either allowing or disallowing a levy. Br. 23-\n24, 27-29. Those arguments are meritless. \nFirst, \u00a7 6330(d)(1) authorizes the Tax Court to de-\ntermine whether the estimated payments should have \ncovered the amount the IRS assessed for the 2010 tax \nyear, no matter whether there is a pending levy. \nThat\u2019s because the Tax Court \u201cshall have jurisdiction\u201d \nto \u201creview\u201d the Appeals Office\u2019s determination of the \ntaxpayer\u2019s underlying liability or issues relating to \nher unpaid tax. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B), (d)(1). And that \nmeans the Tax Court can issue a ruling resolving \nZuch\u2019s liability or issues relating to the unpaid tax. \nThe IRS is expected to abide by that ruling, and in-\ndeed, that ruling will have preclusive effect. Supra \npp. 28-31. \nSecond, \u00a7 6330(e)(1) confirms that the Tax Court \ncan issue its ruling in the form of declaratory relief. \nThat provision authorizes injunctive relief in \u00a7 6330 \nproceedings, which necessarily means it also author-\nizes declaratory relief. That\u2019s because an injunction \nnecessarily rests on a declaration. Indeed, an \n\n41 \n \n \ninjunction prohibiting an act incorporates \u201ca judicial \ndeclaration that [the act] is illegal,\u201d Pet. App. 36a. \nAnd as this Court has recognized, declaratory relief is \na \u201cmilder\u201d alternative to an injunction. Steffel v. \nThompson, 415 U.S. 452, 466-67 (1974). Thus, the Tax \nCourt\u2019s authority to issue an injunction under \n\u00a7 6330(e)(1) includes the authority to issue declara-\ntory relief. \nResisting that conclusion, the government asserts \nthat \u00a7 6330(e)(1) can\u2019t authorize declaratory relief be-\ncause it limits injunctive authority to \u201ca specific \ncollection action.\u201d Br. 28-29. Not so. Section 6330(e)(1) \nauthorizes the Tax Court to enjoin \u201cany action or pro-\nceeding\u201d if: (1) \u201ca timely appeal has been filed under \nsubsection (d)(1),\u201d and (2) the injunction is \u201cin respect \nof the unpaid tax or proposed levy to which the deter-\nmination being appealed relates.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(e)(1); \nsee I.R.C. \u00a7 7421(a). And if the Tax Court can issue an \ninjunction \u201cin respect of the unpaid tax or proposed \nlevy,\u201d it can also decide the taxpayer\u2019s liability that \ngave rise to both the unpaid tax and the proposed levy.  \nThird, the DJA doesn\u2019t withdraw the Tax Court\u2019s \nauthority to issue declaratory relief. That statute au-\nthorizes federal courts to \u201cdeclare the rights and other \nlegal relations of any interested party seeking such \ndeclaration,\u201d \u201cexcept with respect to Federal taxes.\u201d 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2201(a). But courts have uniformly held that \nthe DJA must be read together with the Tax Code and \nthe AIA, I.R.C. \u00a7 7421(a). And that means the DJA \ndoes not prohibit declaratory relief where those other \nprovisions permit injunctions. E.g., Cohen v. United \nStates, 650 F.3d 717, 727-28 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (en banc); \nCIC Services, LLC v. Internal Revenue Service, 925 \nF.3d 247, 250 n.3 (6th Cir. 2019), rev\u2019d on other \ngrounds 593 U.S. 209 (2021); see Bob Jones University \n\n42 \n \n \nv. Simon, 416 U.S. 725, 732 n.7 (1974). Both the plain \ntext of \u00a7 6330(d)(1) and (e)(1) and the AIA, I.R.C. \n\u00a7 7421(a), authorize injunctions in \u00a7 6330 proceed-\nings, so declaratory relief is authorized as well. \nFinally, as explained (at 32-35), \u00a7 6330 isn\u2019t just \nabout whether a levy can proceed or not, so the Tax \nCourt\u2019s authority is not limited to deciding whether or \nnot a levy can proceed, either. Instead, Congress en-\nacted \u00a7 6330 to create a meaningful exception to what \nthe government says is the Tax Code\u2019s historical \u201cpay \nnow, dispute later\u201d framework. See Pet. Br. 2. It did so \nby allowing taxpayers to challenge the unpaid tax and \ntheir liability before they decide to pay or the IRS lev-\nies their property. And as \u00a7 6330\u2019s history confirms, \nthe Tax Court retains jurisdiction under \u00a7 6330 to re-\nview the Appeals Office\u2019s determination of her unpaid \ntax or tax liability, so it can issue binding relief resolv-\ning those issues, too. Supra pp. 23-24, 36-37. \nC. The government\u2019s claim that the parties \nlack a legally cognizable interest in the \ncase once the IRS decides not to move \nforward with the levy is incorrect. \nUnable to show that its actions deprived the Tax \nCourt of \u00a7 6330 jurisdiction, the IRS next contends \n(Br. 21), that the case is moot because once the IRS \ndecides it doesn\u2019t need a levy, the parties lack a legally \ncognizable interest. That is so, the IRS says, because \neven if \u201cthe IRS has made an error or continues to owe \n[the taxpayer] money,\u201d there\u2019s no threatened levy, and \nthe levy is \u201cthe issue that prompted\u201d the collection due \nprocess hearing. Id. That argument fails. \nThe question isn\u2019t whether \u201cthe issue that \nprompted\u201d a collection due process hearing is live. Ra-\nther, \u201c[a]s long as the parties have a concrete interest, \n\n43 \n \n \nhowever small, in the outcome of the litigation,\u201d the \ncase is not moot. Campbell-Ewald Co., 577 U.S. at \n161. And as explained, Zuch has a concrete interest in \nthe outcome of the litigation because the Tax Court \ncan adjudicate her unpaid tax or underlying liability \nby determining her right to the estimated payments, \nand therefore to a refund. Accord Saltzman & Book, \nsupra, \u00a7 14B.16[4][a]. That ruling would also be pre-\nclusive in the refund action Zuch has brought in the \nDistrict of New Jersey under I.R.C. \u00a7 7422. The IRS \nhas a concrete interest, too: if the Tax Court decides \nthat Zuch is not entitled to the estimated payments, \nthe IRS keeps her money. It is thus not \u201cimpossible for \na court to grant any effectual relief what[so]ever\u201d to \nwhomever prevails. Chafin v. Chafin, 568 U.S. 165, \n172 (2013). \nD. Whether Zuch\u2019s challenge is a dispute \nabout an unpaid tax or underlying \nliability is immaterial. \nIn a footnote, the government claims that Zuch\u2019s \nchallenge presents \u201can issue relating to [her] unpaid \ntax,\u201d rather than her tax liability. Br. 25 n.3. But, as \nthe government concedes, whether Zuch\u2019s challenge is \nabout an unpaid tax or underlying liability is immate-\nrial. Id. (\u201cThe Court need not \u2026 decide this dispute to \nresolve the question presented.\u201d). The difference \ndoesn\u2019t matter because, as explained (at 26-27), even \nif Zuch\u2019s challenge is one related to an \u201cunpaid tax,\u201d \nthe Tax Court still had jurisdiction. That\u2019s because \nZuch\u2019s challenge to her unpaid tax would still have \nbeen part of the Appeals Office\u2019s \u201cdetermination\u201d that \nwas reviewable by the Tax Court. Id. \nIn any event, the Appeals Office itself considered \nZuch to be challenging her underlying tax liability. \n\n44 \n \n \nPet. App. 48a, 66a. Indeed, she disputed whether she \nowed \u201cthe amounts that the Commissioner assessed \nfor [the 2010] tax period,\u201d Jeffers, 992 F.3d at 653 n.4, \nbecause she argued the estimated payments should \nhave been applied to her, see Peoplease, 2025 WL \n429626, at *2. Supra p. 26. And, in the IRS\u2019s own view, \n\u201cunpaid tax\u201d is just the unpaid portion of the \u201cunder-\nlying tax liability\u201d anyway.

As the D.C. and Fourth Circuits \nhave held, that special pre-deprivation proceeding be-\ncomes moot when the IRS no longer needs to pursue a \nlevy.  But the Third Circuit in this case openly \u201cpart[ed] \nways\u201d with those circuits, Pet. App. 27a, holding that a \nSection 6330 proceeding may continue even in the ab-\nsence of any pending levy.  Respondent\u2019s attempts to de-\nfend that decision misunderstand the text of the statute \nthat Congress enacted.  And respondent\u2019s denial of the \nexistence of a circuit split contradicts what the decision \nitself acknowledges.  The petition for a writ of certiorari \nshould be granted. \n\n2 \n \nA. Respondent\u2019s Efforts To Defend The Decision Below \nLack Merit \nAs the petition explains (at 8-14), the Section 6330 \nproceeding in this case is moot because there is no longer \na live dispute over the proposed levy that prompted the \nproceeding.  The court of appeals\u2019 contrary decision is \nwrong, Pet. App. 16a-39a, and respondent\u2019s efforts to de-\nfend it lack merit. \n1. Because there is no longer a live dispute over the \nproposed levy in this case, the Section 6330 proceeding \nis moot \nAs an Article I court, \u201c[t]he Tax Court is a court of \nlimited jurisdiction.\u201d  Commissioner v. McCoy, 484 U.S. \n3, 7 (1987) (per curiam); see 26 U.S.C. 7441.  In a Section \n6330 proceeding, the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction is limited \nto reviewing a particular \u201cdetermination\u201d by the IRS \nIndependent Office of Appeals (Appeals Office): a \u201cde-\ntermination\u201d whether the proposed levy may proceed.  26 \nU.S.C. 6330(c)(3) and (d)(1).  When there is no longer a \nlive controversy over the proposed levy, there is no longer \nany need for such a determination, and the Section 6330 \nproceeding is \u201cmoot.\u201d  Willson v. Commissioner, 805 F.3d \n316, 321 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (citation omitted).  That is so \n\u201cnotwithstanding the existence of other live controver-\nsies between the taxpayer and the IRS that do not fall \nwithin the tax court\u2019s jurisdiction\u201d under Section 6330.  \nId. at 320. \nRespondent does not dispute that there is no longer \na live controversy over the proposed levy in this case.  \nIn fact, respondent acknowledges (Br. in Opp. 20) that \n\u201cthe IRS decided to stop pursuing the levy\u201d after it was \nable to use respondent\u2019s overpayments to offset her tax \nliability under 26 U.S.C. 6402(a).  That should be the end \nof the matter.  Because there is no longer any need for \n\n3 \n \na determination whether the proposed levy may go for-\nward, the Section 6330 proceeding in this case is moot. \n2. Respondent\u2019s contrary arguments are unpersuasive \nIn concluding that the Section 6330 proceeding in this \ncase is not moot, the court of appeals held that (a) the \nTax Court still has jurisdiction to consider respondent\u2019s \n\u201cunderlying tax liability,\u201d Pet. App. 26a (citation omit-\nted), and (b) the IRS\u2019s exercise of statutory authority to \noffset respondent\u2019s tax liability was \u201cinvalid,\u201d id. at 25a.  \nRespondent\u2019s arguments in support of the first holding \nlack merit, and respondent does not even attempt to de-\nfend the second holding. \na. The Tax Court lacks jurisdiction to consider \n\u201cthe underlying tax liability\u201d when there is no \nlive dispute over the proposed levy \nRespondent contends (Br. in Opp. 12) that \u201cSection \n6330 authorizes the Tax Court to review the Appeals Of-\nfice\u2019s determination of a taxpayer\u2019s underlying liability \nand to issue declaratory relief accordingly, notwithstand-\ning the IRS\u2019s decision to stop pursuing a levy.\u201d  That is \nincorrect.  The only determination that Section 6330 au-\nthorizes the Tax Court to review is the Appeals Office\u2019s \n\u201cdetermination\u201d whether a proposed levy may proceed.  \n26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3) and (d)(1).  Here, for example, the \n\u201cNotice of Determination\u201d issued by the Appeals Office \nspecifies that the Office \u201chas determined to sustain the \naction (levy).\u201d  Pet. App. 61a, 64a (capitalization altered).  \nAnd the only relief that Section 6330 authorizes upon \nreview of that determination is rejection of the proposed \nlevy.  See Willson, 805 F.3d at 321.1 \n \n1 Section 6330(e)(1) is not to the contrary.  That provision merely \nauthorizes the Tax Court to enjoin \u201cthe beginning of a levy or pro-\nceeding during\u201d the pendency of a Section 6330 proceeding.  26 U.S.C. \n \n\n4 \n \nOf course, in \u201cdetermin[ing]\u201d whether a proposed \nlevy may proceed, the Appeals Office may consider var-\nious subsidiary issues, including \u201cchallenges to the ex-\nistence or amount of the underlying tax liability  * * *   \nif the person did not receive any statutory notice of de-\nficiency for such tax liability or did not otherwise have \nan opportunity to dispute such tax liability.\u201d  26 U.S.C. \n6330(c)(2)(B) and (3).2  But the text of Section 6330 makes \nclear that when there is no longer any live dispute over \nthe proposed levy, there is no longer any jurisdiction to \nconsider challenges about those subsidiary issues.  The \nstatute does not identify them as freestanding issues, \nbut rather as ones that \u201c[t]he determination\u201d about the \nproposed levy \u201cshall take into consideration,\u201d 26 U.S.C. \n6330(c)(3)\u2014confirming that when the \u201cproposed levy is \nmoot,\u201d a taxpayer \u201chas no independent basis\u201d to continue \npursuing those challenges, Greene-Thapedi v. Commis-\n \n6330(e)(1).  Contrary to respondent\u2019s suggestion (Br. in Opp. 23), Sec-\ntion 6330(e)(1) does not authorize the Tax Court to \u201cdeclare [a tax-\npayer\u2019s] liability\u201d\u2014let alone authorize that court to issue any relief \nin the absence of a pending levy. \n2 Like the court of appeals, respondent characterizes her challenge \nto the IRS\u2019s allocation of estimated payments in this case as a chal-\nlenge to \u201cthe underlying tax liability.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B); see \nBr. in Opp. 14, 19; Pet. App. 17a-19a.  The government disputes that \ncharacterization; in its view, respondent\u2019s challenge presents an \u201cis-\nsue relating to the unpaid tax,\u201d 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(A), which a tax-\npayer could raise in the course of a live controversy over a proposed \nlevy even if the taxpayer had previously received a \u201cstatutory notice \nof deficiency,\u201d 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B).  See Gov\u2019t C.A. Supp. Br. 24-\n25.  This dispute over the characterization of respondent\u2019s challenge, \nhowever, has no bearing on the correct answer to the question pre-\nsented.  Even under respondent\u2019s characterization of her challenge, \nthe Section 6330 proceeding in this case is moot because a taxpayer \nmay challenge \u201cthe underlying tax liability\u201d only in connection with \na determination about a proposed levy.  See Pet. 10-11. \n\n5 \n \nsioner, 126 T.C. 1, 8 (2006).  And Congress\u2019s use of the \nphrase \u201cunderlying tax liability\u201d reinforces the infer-\nence that jurisdiction exists only in connection with a \npre-deprivation determination about a proposed levy.  \n26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B) (emphasis added); see Pet. 11.  \nRespondent therefore errs in asserting (Br. in Opp. 18) \nthat \u201c[n]othing in \u00a7 6330 purports to condition the Tax \nCourt\u2019s ongoing jurisdiction on the IRS\u2019s continued pur-\nsuit of a levy.\u201d \nContrary to respondent\u2019s contention (Br. in Opp. 15-\n16), the statutory history and context undermine, rather \nthan support, her interpretation of Section 6330.  Con-\ngress enacted Section 6330 on the view that \u201c[d]ue pro-\ncess\u201d warrants giving taxpayers notice and an oppor-\ntunity to be heard before the IRS engages in a particu-\nlar type of collection action: a levy on a taxpayer\u2019s prop-\nerty.  Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Re-\nform Act of 1998, Pub. L. No. 105-206, Tit. III, \u00a7 3401(b), \n112 Stat. 747.  When the IRS decides that it no longer \nneeds to levy on the taxpayer\u2019s property, that rationale \nfor a pre-deprivation proceeding no longer applies. \nCongress\u2019s 2006 amendment to Section 6330 does not \nsuggest otherwise.  Section 6330(d)(1) originally granted \nboth the Tax Court and district courts jurisdiction to re-\nview the Appeals Office\u2019s determinations, depending on \nthe type of tax at issue.  26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1) (Supp. IV \n1998).  The 2006 amendment simply revised Section \n6330(d)(1) to make the Tax Court the sole court with ju-\nrisdiction to review those determinations.  Pension Pro-\ntection Act of 2006, Pub. L. No. 109-280, \u00a7 855(a), 120 \nStat. 1019.  Nothing about that amendment suggests that \na Section 6330 proceeding may continue without any \nlive dispute over a proposed levy. \n\n6 \n \nRespondent attempts to analogize Section 6330 to \nfederal statutes that make \u201cjurisdiction \u2018depend upon \nthe state of things at the time of the action brought.\u2019\u200a\u201d  \nBr. in Opp. 16 (brackets and citation omitted).  But those \nanalogies fail because Section 6330 limits the Tax Court\u2019s \njurisdiction to review of a particular kind of \u201cdetermi-\nnation\u201d: a \u201cdetermination\u201d whether the proposed levy \nmay proceed.  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3) and (d)(1).  When there \nis no longer any need for such a determination, the Sec-\ntion 6330 proceeding is moot. \nFinally, respondent invokes \u201cthe presumption favor-\ning judicial review of administrative action.\u201d  Br. in Opp. \n23 (quoting Guerrero-Lasprilla v. Barr, 589 U.S. 221, \n229 (2020)).  But that presumption is inapplicable here \nbecause the government\u2019s interpretation of Section 6330 \ndoes not eliminate judicial review.  See Pet. 14.  As re-\nspondent acknowledges, taxpayers in her position may \nstill \u201chead to court\u201d by filing a refund suit\u2014the tradi-\ntional mechanism for disputing the assessment or col-\nlection of a federal tax, and the one that is available \nwhether or not there was ever a proposed levy to trigger \nSection 6330.  Br. in Opp. 4; see, e.g., id. at 2 (acknowl-\nedging that \u201ctaxpayers can file refund suits anyway\u201d); \nid. at 13 (acknowledging that \u201cthe taxpayer can sepa-\nrately sue the government for a refund under [26 U.S.C.] \n7422\u201d). \nb. The Tax Court lacks jurisdiction to review offsets \nin a Section 6330 proceeding \nIn concluding that the Section 6330 proceeding in this \ncase is not moot, the court of appeals also held that the \nIRS\u2019s exercise of statutory authority to offset respond-\nent\u2019s tax liability was invalid.  Pet. App. 19a-25a.  Re-\nspondent makes no attempt to defend that holding, see \nBr. in Opp. 3-4, 13, 18-19, and for good reason.  As the pe-\n\n7 \n \ntition explains (at 12-14), no statute grants the Tax Court \njurisdiction to review the IRS\u2019s exercise of statutory  \nauthority to credit a taxpayer\u2019s overpayments against \nher tax liability.  And in any event, even if the Tax Court \nhad such jurisdiction, and even if the offsets were inva-\nlid, there would still be no live controversy over whether \nthe proposed levy may proceed\u2014as would be required \nfor the Tax Court to be able to consider respondent\u2019s  \nchallenge to \u201cthe underlying tax liability.\u201d  26 U.S.C. \n6330(c)(2)(B); see Pet. 10-11, 13.  The court of appeals\u2019 \nattempt to avoid a mootness problem by deeming the \noffsets invalid therefore fails. \nB. Respondent\u2019s Attempts To Minimize The Need For This \nCourt\u2019s Review Are Unavailing \n1. As the petition explains (at 14-16), the Third Cir-\ncuit\u2019s decision in this case conflicts with decisions of the \nD.C. and Fourth Circuits. \na. The Third Circuit itself recognized that its deci-\nsion \u201cpart[s] ways\u201d with the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision in \nWillson v. Commissioner, supra.  Pet. App. 27a.  Re-\nspondent nevertheless denies the existence of a conflict, \nasserting (Br. in Opp. 12) that Willson \u201cheld only that a \n\u00a7 6330 proceeding becomes moot if the IRS decides to \nstop pursuing the levy and no dispute about the tax-\npayer\u2019s liability remains.\u201d  But that is not what Willson \nheld.  Rather, as the decision below acknowledged, Will-\nson held that \u201cthere is \u2018no appropriate course of action \nfor the Tax Court to take but to dismiss a case as moot\u2019 \nwhen the IRS withdraws its proposed levy.\u201d  Pet. App. \n27a (quoting Willson, 805 F.3d at 321) (brackets omit-\nted).  That holding cannot be reconciled with the Third \nCircuit\u2019s view that the Section 6330 proceeding in this \ncase \u201cis not moot\u201d even though the IRS withdrew its pro-\nposed levy.  Id. at 2a. \n\n8 \n \nRespondent is thus wrong in contending (Br. in Opp. \n12-13) that the D.C. Circuit would be \u201cfree to agree with \nthe Third Circuit in a future case with a liability dis-\npute.\u201d  Though Willson involved a \u201ccontinuing contro-\nversy\u201d over whether the taxpayer was entitled to a \u201cre-\nturn\u201d of certain funds, 805 F.3d at 318, the D.C. Circuit \nheld that the Section 6330 proceeding was moot in \u201cthe \nabsence of a pending levy,\u201d id. at 321.  The D.C. Circuit \nexplained:  \u201cWith no levy being placed upon Willson\u2019s \nproperty, there was no actual case in controversy re-\ngarding his appeal of such a levy action.\u201d  Ibid. (brack-\nets, citation, and ellipsis omitted).  That holding makes \nclear that the outcome of this case would have been dif-\nferent if it had arisen in the D.C. Circuit.  And the fact \nthat Willson turned on \u201cthe absence of a pending levy\u201d \nforecloses any possibility that the D.C. Circuit might \nagree with the Third Circuit in a future case.  Ibid. \nRespondent\u2019s own arguments in support of the deci-\nsion below highlight the conflict with Willson.  In de-\nfending the Third Circuit\u2019s decision, respondent argues \nthat the government is \u201cincorrect\u201d that \u201cthe \u2018only relief \nthat Section 6330 authorizes is rejection of a proposed \nlevy.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Br. in Opp. 23 (quoting Pet. 14 n.2).  The D.C. Cir-\ncuit in Willson, however, agreed with the government \nthat the rejection of a proposed levy is \u201call the relief \nthat section 6330 authorizes the tax court to grant.\u201d  805 \nF.3d at 321.  Willson thus held that a Section 6330 pro-\nceeding is moot when \u201c[t]he IRS no longer seeks to levy \non [the taxpayer\u2019s] property,\u201d ibid.\u2014a holding that di-\nrectly conflicts with the Third Circuit\u2019s decision below. \nb. The Third Circuit also recognized that its decision \nin this case \u201cpart[s] ways\u201d with the Fourth Circuit\u2019s de-\ncision in McLane v. Commissioner, 24 F.4th 316, cert. \ndenied, 143 S. Ct. 408 (2022).  Pet. App. 27a.  Yet respond-\n\n9 \n \nent denies the existence of that conflict as well.  Con-\ntrary to respondent\u2019s contention (Br. in Opp. 3), how-\never, McLane did not \u201chold only that a \u00a7 6330 Tax Court \nproceeding becomes moot when the government stops \npursuing the levy and the parties don\u2019t dispute the un-\nderlying tax liability.\u201d  Instead, McLane held that a Sec-\ntion 6330 proceeding is moot when a taxpayer \u201cno longer \nfaces\u201d a levy.  24 F.4th at 319.  That holding contradicts \nthe Third Circuit\u2019s decision in this case, which held that \na Section 6330 proceeding \u201cis not moot\u201d even though re-\nspondent no longer faces a levy.  Pet. App. 2a. \nRespondent likewise errs in asserting (Br. in Opp. \n12-13) that the Fourth Circuit would be \u201cfree to agree \nwith the Third Circuit in a future case with a liability \ndispute.\u201d  After all, McLane itself was a case with a lia-\nbility dispute:  The taxpayer \u201ccontend[ed] that the phrase \n\u2018underlying tax liability\u2019  * * *  confer[red] jurisdiction \non the Tax Court to determine that he overpaid and [to] \norder a refund.\u201d  24 F.4th at 318.  But whereas the Third \nCircuit found \u201cnothing in \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B) to suggest that \na taxpayer\u2019s right to challenge the existence or amount \nof her underlying tax becomes moot once the levy is no \nlonger being enforced,\u201d Pet. App. 26a-27a, the Fourth \nCircuit in McLane found just the opposite\u2014namely, that \n\u201c[t]he phrase \u2018underlying tax liability\u2019 does not provide \nthe Tax Court jurisdiction over independent overpay-\nment claims when the collection action no longer ex-\nists,\u201d 24 F.4th at 319.  Because the Fourth Circuit con-\nstrued that phrase more \u201cnarrowly\u201d than the Third Cir-\ncuit did in this case, Pet. App. 27a, the conflict between \nthe circuits is square. \nAttempting to distinguish McLane on its facts, re-\nspondent notes that the taxpayer in that case sought a \nrefund for the first time in the Tax Court.  Br. in Opp. 29 \n\n10 \n \n(citing McLane, 24 F.4th at 318).  But that fact played \nno role in the Fourth Circuit\u2019s reasoning.  Instead, the \nFourth Circuit held that \u201cthe \u2018taxpayer was permitted \nto challenge the amount of his underlying liability in the \n[Section 6330] hearing  . . .  only in the context of deter-\nmining whether the collection action could proceed.\u2019\u200a\u201d  \nMcLane, 24 F.4th at 319 (citation omitted).  And because \nthe taxpayer \u201cno longer face[d] such an action,\u201d the Sec-\ntion 6330 proceeding was moot.  Ibid. \n2. As the petition explains (at 16), the Third Circuit\u2019s \ndecision in this case also conflicts with decisions of other \ncircuits recognizing that the Tax Court possesses only \nthat jurisdiction expressly authorized by Congress.  Re-\nspondent contends (Br. in Opp. 30-31) that none of those \nother decisions addressed whether the Tax Court has \njurisdiction to review offsets in a Section 6330 proceed-\ning.  But each of the other circuits\u2019 decisions recognized \nthat the Tax Court may exercise jurisdiction only to the \nextent expressly authorized.  See Pet. 16.  And respond-\nent makes no attempt to reconcile that fundamental \nprinciple with the decision below\u2014which, as respondent \nacknowledges (Br. in Opp. 3), held that \u201cthe Tax Court \nhas \u2018implicit\u2019 jurisdiction to review IRS offsets in \u00a7 6330 \nproceedings.\u201d \n3. Finally, respondent asserts (Br. in Opp. 11-12) that \nthe question presented \u201crarely arises and is of little prac-\ntical importance to the workable administration of the \ntax laws.\u201d  That is incorrect.  As the petition explains, \nthere are tens of thousands of Section 6330 proceedings \neach year, see Pet. 16-17, and the question presented \narises each time \u201cthere is no longer a live dispute over \nthe proposed levy that gave rise to [such a] proceeding,\u201d \nPet. I.  Contrary to respondent\u2019s contention (Br. in Opp. \n32-33), moreover, the decision below threatens signifi-\n\n11 \n \ncant practical consequences\u2014not only by expanding the \nscope of Section 6330 proceedings far beyond what Con-\ngress contemplated, see Pet. 17, but also by embracing \na theory of \u201cimplicit\u201d Tax Court jurisdiction unbounded \nby any statutory text, Pet. App. 20a.\n*  *  *  *  * \nFor the foregoing reasons and those stated in the  \npetition for a writ of certiorari, the petition should be \ngranted. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nBRIAN H.

As the D.C. and Fourth Circuits \nhave held, that special pre-deprivation proceeding be-\ncomes moot when the IRS no longer needs to pursue a \nlevy.  But the Third Circuit in this case openly \u201cpart[ed] \nways\u201d with those circuits, Pet. App. 27a, holding that a \nSection 6330 proceeding may continue even in the ab-\nsence of any pending levy.  Respondent\u2019s attempts to de-\nfend that decision misunderstand the text of the statute \nthat Congress enacted.  And respondent\u2019s denial of the \nexistence of a circuit split contradicts what the decision \nitself acknowledges.  The petition for a writ of certiorari \nshould be granted. \n\n2 \n \nA. Respondent\u2019s Efforts To Defend The Decision Below \nLack Merit \nAs the petition explains (at 8-14), the Section 6330 \nproceeding in this case is moot because there is no longer \na live dispute over the proposed levy that prompted the \nproceeding.  The court of appeals\u2019 contrary decision is \nwrong, Pet. App. 16a-39a, and respondent\u2019s efforts to de-\nfend it lack merit. \n1. Because there is no longer a live dispute over the \nproposed levy in this case, the Section 6330 proceeding \nis moot \nAs an Article I court, \u201c[t]he Tax Court is a court of \nlimited jurisdiction.\u201d  Commissioner v. McCoy, 484 U.S. \n3, 7 (1987) (per curiam); see 26 U.S.C. 7441.  In a Section \n6330 proceeding, the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction is limited \nto reviewing a particular \u201cdetermination\u201d by the IRS \nIndependent Office of Appeals (Appeals Office): a \u201cde-\ntermination\u201d whether the proposed levy may proceed.  26 \nU.S.C. 6330(c)(3) and (d)(1).  When there is no longer a \nlive controversy over the proposed levy, there is no longer \nany need for such a determination, and the Section 6330 \nproceeding is \u201cmoot.\u201d  Willson v. Commissioner, 805 F.3d \n316, 321 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (citation omitted).  That is so \n\u201cnotwithstanding the existence of other live controver-\nsies between the taxpayer and the IRS that do not fall \nwithin the tax court\u2019s jurisdiction\u201d under Section 6330.  \nId. at 320. \nRespondent does not dispute that there is no longer \na live controversy over the proposed levy in this case.  \nIn fact, respondent acknowledges (Br. in Opp. 20) that \n\u201cthe IRS decided to stop pursuing the levy\u201d after it was \nable to use respondent\u2019s overpayments to offset her tax \nliability under 26 U.S.C. 6402(a).  That should be the end \nof the matter.  Because there is no longer any need for \n\n3 \n \na determination whether the proposed levy may go for-\nward, the Section 6330 proceeding in this case is moot. \n2. Respondent\u2019s contrary arguments are unpersuasive \nIn concluding that the Section 6330 proceeding in this \ncase is not moot, the court of appeals held that (a) the \nTax Court still has jurisdiction to consider respondent\u2019s \n\u201cunderlying tax liability,\u201d Pet. App. 26a (citation omit-\nted), and (b) the IRS\u2019s exercise of statutory authority to \noffset respondent\u2019s tax liability was \u201cinvalid,\u201d id. at 25a.  \nRespondent\u2019s arguments in support of the first holding \nlack merit, and respondent does not even attempt to de-\nfend the second holding. \na. The Tax Court lacks jurisdiction to consider \n\u201cthe underlying tax liability\u201d when there is no \nlive dispute over the proposed levy \nRespondent contends (Br. in Opp. 12) that \u201cSection \n6330 authorizes the Tax Court to review the Appeals Of-\nfice\u2019s determination of a taxpayer\u2019s underlying liability \nand to issue declaratory relief accordingly, notwithstand-\ning the IRS\u2019s decision to stop pursuing a levy.\u201d  That is \nincorrect.  The only determination that Section 6330 au-\nthorizes the Tax Court to review is the Appeals Office\u2019s \n\u201cdetermination\u201d whether a proposed levy may proceed.  \n26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3) and (d)(1).  Here, for example, the \n\u201cNotice of Determination\u201d issued by the Appeals Office \nspecifies that the Office \u201chas determined to sustain the \naction (levy).\u201d  Pet. App. 61a, 64a (capitalization altered).  \nAnd the only relief that Section 6330 authorizes upon \nreview of that determination is rejection of the proposed \nlevy.  See Willson, 805 F.3d at 321.1 \n \n1 Section 6330(e)(1) is not to the contrary.  That provision merely \nauthorizes the Tax Court to enjoin \u201cthe beginning of a levy or pro-\nceeding during\u201d the pendency of a Section 6330 proceeding.  26 U.S.C. \n \n\n4 \n \nOf course, in \u201cdetermin[ing]\u201d whether a proposed \nlevy may proceed, the Appeals Office may consider var-\nious subsidiary issues, including \u201cchallenges to the ex-\nistence or amount of the underlying tax liability  * * *   \nif the person did not receive any statutory notice of de-\nficiency for such tax liability or did not otherwise have \nan opportunity to dispute such tax liability.\u201d  26 U.S.C. \n6330(c)(2)(B) and (3).2  But the text of Section 6330 makes \nclear that when there is no longer any live dispute over \nthe proposed levy, there is no longer any jurisdiction to \nconsider challenges about those subsidiary issues.  The \nstatute does not identify them as freestanding issues, \nbut rather as ones that \u201c[t]he determination\u201d about the \nproposed levy \u201cshall take into consideration,\u201d 26 U.S.C. \n6330(c)(3)\u2014confirming that when the \u201cproposed levy is \nmoot,\u201d a taxpayer \u201chas no independent basis\u201d to continue \npursuing those challenges, Greene-Thapedi v. Commis-\n \n6330(e)(1).  Contrary to respondent\u2019s suggestion (Br. in Opp. 23), Sec-\ntion 6330(e)(1) does not authorize the Tax Court to \u201cdeclare [a tax-\npayer\u2019s] liability\u201d\u2014let alone authorize that court to issue any relief \nin the absence of a pending levy. \n2 Like the court of appeals, respondent characterizes her challenge \nto the IRS\u2019s allocation of estimated payments in this case as a chal-\nlenge to \u201cthe underlying tax liability.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B); see \nBr. in Opp. 14, 19; Pet. App. 17a-19a.  The government disputes that \ncharacterization; in its view, respondent\u2019s challenge presents an \u201cis-\nsue relating to the unpaid tax,\u201d 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(A), which a tax-\npayer could raise in the course of a live controversy over a proposed \nlevy even if the taxpayer had previously received a \u201cstatutory notice \nof deficiency,\u201d 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B).  See Gov\u2019t C.A. Supp. Br. 24-\n25.  This dispute over the characterization of respondent\u2019s challenge, \nhowever, has no bearing on the correct answer to the question pre-\nsented.  Even under respondent\u2019s characterization of her challenge, \nthe Section 6330 proceeding in this case is moot because a taxpayer \nmay challenge \u201cthe underlying tax liability\u201d only in connection with \na determination about a proposed levy.  See Pet. 10-11. \n\n5 \n \nsioner, 126 T.C. 1, 8 (2006).  And Congress\u2019s use of the \nphrase \u201cunderlying tax liability\u201d reinforces the infer-\nence that jurisdiction exists only in connection with a \npre-deprivation determination about a proposed levy.  \n26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B) (emphasis added); see Pet. 11.  \nRespondent therefore errs in asserting (Br. in Opp. 18) \nthat \u201c[n]othing in \u00a7 6330 purports to condition the Tax \nCourt\u2019s ongoing jurisdiction on the IRS\u2019s continued pur-\nsuit of a levy.\u201d \nContrary to respondent\u2019s contention (Br. in Opp. 15-\n16), the statutory history and context undermine, rather \nthan support, her interpretation of Section 6330.  Con-\ngress enacted Section 6330 on the view that \u201c[d]ue pro-\ncess\u201d warrants giving taxpayers notice and an oppor-\ntunity to be heard before the IRS engages in a particu-\nlar type of collection action: a levy on a taxpayer\u2019s prop-\nerty.  Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Re-\nform Act of 1998, Pub. L. No. 105-206, Tit. III, \u00a7 3401(b), \n112 Stat. 747.  When the IRS decides that it no longer \nneeds to levy on the taxpayer\u2019s property, that rationale \nfor a pre-deprivation proceeding no longer applies. \nCongress\u2019s 2006 amendment to Section 6330 does not \nsuggest otherwise.  Section 6330(d)(1) originally granted \nboth the Tax Court and district courts jurisdiction to re-\nview the Appeals Office\u2019s determinations, depending on \nthe type of tax at issue.  26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1) (Supp. IV \n1998).  The 2006 amendment simply revised Section \n6330(d)(1) to make the Tax Court the sole court with ju-\nrisdiction to review those determinations.  Pension Pro-\ntection Act of 2006, Pub. L. No. 109-280, \u00a7 855(a), 120 \nStat. 1019.  Nothing about that amendment suggests that \na Section 6330 proceeding may continue without any \nlive dispute over a proposed levy. \n\n6 \n \nRespondent attempts to analogize Section 6330 to \nfederal statutes that make \u201cjurisdiction \u2018depend upon \nthe state of things at the time of the action brought.\u2019\u200a\u201d  \nBr. in Opp. 16 (brackets and citation omitted).  But those \nanalogies fail because Section 6330 limits the Tax Court\u2019s \njurisdiction to review of a particular kind of \u201cdetermi-\nnation\u201d: a \u201cdetermination\u201d whether the proposed levy \nmay proceed.  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3) and (d)(1).  When there \nis no longer any need for such a determination, the Sec-\ntion 6330 proceeding is moot. \nFinally, respondent invokes \u201cthe presumption favor-\ning judicial review of administrative action.\u201d  Br. in Opp. \n23 (quoting Guerrero-Lasprilla v. Barr, 589 U.S. 221, \n229 (2020)).  But that presumption is inapplicable here \nbecause the government\u2019s interpretation of Section 6330 \ndoes not eliminate judicial review.  See Pet. 14.  As re-\nspondent acknowledges, taxpayers in her position may \nstill \u201chead to court\u201d by filing a refund suit\u2014the tradi-\ntional mechanism for disputing the assessment or col-\nlection of a federal tax, and the one that is available \nwhether or not there was ever a proposed levy to trigger \nSection 6330.  Br. in Opp. 4; see, e.g., id. at 2 (acknowl-\nedging that \u201ctaxpayers can file refund suits anyway\u201d); \nid. at 13 (acknowledging that \u201cthe taxpayer can sepa-\nrately sue the government for a refund under [26 U.S.C.] \n7422\u201d). \nb. The Tax Court lacks jurisdiction to review offsets \nin a Section 6330 proceeding \nIn concluding that the Section 6330 proceeding in this \ncase is not moot, the court of appeals also held that the \nIRS\u2019s exercise of statutory authority to offset respond-\nent\u2019s tax liability was invalid.  Pet. App. 19a-25a.  Re-\nspondent makes no attempt to defend that holding, see \nBr. in Opp. 3-4, 13, 18-19, and for good reason.  As the pe-\n\n7 \n \ntition explains (at 12-14), no statute grants the Tax Court \njurisdiction to review the IRS\u2019s exercise of statutory  \nauthority to credit a taxpayer\u2019s overpayments against \nher tax liability.  And in any event, even if the Tax Court \nhad such jurisdiction, and even if the offsets were inva-\nlid, there would still be no live controversy over whether \nthe proposed levy may proceed\u2014as would be required \nfor the Tax Court to be able to consider respondent\u2019s  \nchallenge to \u201cthe underlying tax liability.\u201d  26 U.S.C. \n6330(c)(2)(B); see Pet. 10-11, 13.  The court of appeals\u2019 \nattempt to avoid a mootness problem by deeming the \noffsets invalid therefore fails. \nB. Respondent\u2019s Attempts To Minimize The Need For This \nCourt\u2019s Review Are Unavailing \n1. As the petition explains (at 14-16), the Third Cir-\ncuit\u2019s decision in this case conflicts with decisions of the \nD.C. and Fourth Circuits. \na. The Third Circuit itself recognized that its deci-\nsion \u201cpart[s] ways\u201d with the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision in \nWillson v. Commissioner, supra.  Pet. App. 27a.  Re-\nspondent nevertheless denies the existence of a conflict, \nasserting (Br. in Opp. 12) that Willson \u201cheld only that a \n\u00a7 6330 proceeding becomes moot if the IRS decides to \nstop pursuing the levy and no dispute about the tax-\npayer\u2019s liability remains.\u201d  But that is not what Willson \nheld.  Rather, as the decision below acknowledged, Will-\nson held that \u201cthere is \u2018no appropriate course of action \nfor the Tax Court to take but to dismiss a case as moot\u2019 \nwhen the IRS withdraws its proposed levy.\u201d  Pet. App. \n27a (quoting Willson, 805 F.3d at 321) (brackets omit-\nted).  That holding cannot be reconciled with the Third \nCircuit\u2019s view that the Section 6330 proceeding in this \ncase \u201cis not moot\u201d even though the IRS withdrew its pro-\nposed levy.  Id. at 2a. \n\n8 \n \nRespondent is thus wrong in contending (Br. in Opp. \n12-13) that the D.C. Circuit would be \u201cfree to agree with \nthe Third Circuit in a future case with a liability dis-\npute.\u201d  Though Willson involved a \u201ccontinuing contro-\nversy\u201d over whether the taxpayer was entitled to a \u201cre-\nturn\u201d of certain funds, 805 F.3d at 318, the D.C. Circuit \nheld that the Section 6330 proceeding was moot in \u201cthe \nabsence of a pending levy,\u201d id. at 321.  The D.C. Circuit \nexplained:  \u201cWith no levy being placed upon Willson\u2019s \nproperty, there was no actual case in controversy re-\ngarding his appeal of such a levy action.\u201d  Ibid. (brack-\nets, citation, and ellipsis omitted).  That holding makes \nclear that the outcome of this case would have been dif-\nferent if it had arisen in the D.C. Circuit.  And the fact \nthat Willson turned on \u201cthe absence of a pending levy\u201d \nforecloses any possibility that the D.C. Circuit might \nagree with the Third Circuit in a future case.  Ibid. \nRespondent\u2019s own arguments in support of the deci-\nsion below highlight the conflict with Willson.  In de-\nfending the Third Circuit\u2019s decision, respondent argues \nthat the government is \u201cincorrect\u201d that \u201cthe \u2018only relief \nthat Section 6330 authorizes is rejection of a proposed \nlevy.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Br. in Opp. 23 (quoting Pet. 14 n.2).  The D.C. Cir-\ncuit in Willson, however, agreed with the government \nthat the rejection of a proposed levy is \u201call the relief \nthat section 6330 authorizes the tax court to grant.\u201d  805 \nF.3d at 321.  Willson thus held that a Section 6330 pro-\nceeding is moot when \u201c[t]he IRS no longer seeks to levy \non [the taxpayer\u2019s] property,\u201d ibid.\u2014a holding that di-\nrectly conflicts with the Third Circuit\u2019s decision below. \nb. The Third Circuit also recognized that its decision \nin this case \u201cpart[s] ways\u201d with the Fourth Circuit\u2019s de-\ncision in McLane v. Commissioner, 24 F.4th 316, cert. \ndenied, 143 S. Ct. 408 (2022).  Pet. App. 27a.  Yet respond-\n\n9 \n \nent denies the existence of that conflict as well.  Con-\ntrary to respondent\u2019s contention (Br. in Opp. 3), how-\never, McLane did not \u201chold only that a \u00a7 6330 Tax Court \nproceeding becomes moot when the government stops \npursuing the levy and the parties don\u2019t dispute the un-\nderlying tax liability.\u201d  Instead, McLane held that a Sec-\ntion 6330 proceeding is moot when a taxpayer \u201cno longer \nfaces\u201d a levy.  24 F.4th at 319.  That holding contradicts \nthe Third Circuit\u2019s decision in this case, which held that \na Section 6330 proceeding \u201cis not moot\u201d even though re-\nspondent no longer faces a levy.  Pet. App. 2a. \nRespondent likewise errs in asserting (Br. in Opp. \n12-13) that the Fourth Circuit would be \u201cfree to agree \nwith the Third Circuit in a future case with a liability \ndispute.\u201d  After all, McLane itself was a case with a lia-\nbility dispute:  The taxpayer \u201ccontend[ed] that the phrase \n\u2018underlying tax liability\u2019  * * *  confer[red] jurisdiction \non the Tax Court to determine that he overpaid and [to] \norder a refund.\u201d  24 F.4th at 318.  But whereas the Third \nCircuit found \u201cnothing in \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B) to suggest that \na taxpayer\u2019s right to challenge the existence or amount \nof her underlying tax becomes moot once the levy is no \nlonger being enforced,\u201d Pet. App. 26a-27a, the Fourth \nCircuit in McLane found just the opposite\u2014namely, that \n\u201c[t]he phrase \u2018underlying tax liability\u2019 does not provide \nthe Tax Court jurisdiction over independent overpay-\nment claims when the collection action no longer ex-\nists,\u201d 24 F.4th at 319.  Because the Fourth Circuit con-\nstrued that phrase more \u201cnarrowly\u201d than the Third Cir-\ncuit did in this case, Pet. App. 27a, the conflict between \nthe circuits is square. \nAttempting to distinguish McLane on its facts, re-\nspondent notes that the taxpayer in that case sought a \nrefund for the first time in the Tax Court.  Br. in Opp. 29 \n\n10 \n \n(citing McLane, 24 F.4th at 318).  But that fact played \nno role in the Fourth Circuit\u2019s reasoning.  Instead, the \nFourth Circuit held that \u201cthe \u2018taxpayer was permitted \nto challenge the amount of his underlying liability in the \n[Section 6330] hearing  . . .  only in the context of deter-\nmining whether the collection action could proceed.\u2019\u200a\u201d  \nMcLane, 24 F.4th at 319 (citation omitted).  And because \nthe taxpayer \u201cno longer face[d] such an action,\u201d the Sec-\ntion 6330 proceeding was moot.  Ibid. \n2. As the petition explains (at 16), the Third Circuit\u2019s \ndecision in this case also conflicts with decisions of other \ncircuits recognizing that the Tax Court possesses only \nthat jurisdiction expressly authorized by Congress.  Re-\nspondent contends (Br. in Opp. 30-31) that none of those \nother decisions addressed whether the Tax Court has \njurisdiction to review offsets in a Section 6330 proceed-\ning.  But each of the other circuits\u2019 decisions recognized \nthat the Tax Court may exercise jurisdiction only to the \nextent expressly authorized.  See Pet. 16.  And respond-\nent makes no attempt to reconcile that fundamental \nprinciple with the decision below\u2014which, as respondent \nacknowledges (Br. in Opp. 3), held that \u201cthe Tax Court \nhas \u2018implicit\u2019 jurisdiction to review IRS offsets in \u00a7 6330 \nproceedings.\u201d \n3. Finally, respondent asserts (Br. in Opp. 11-12) that \nthe question presented \u201crarely arises and is of little prac-\ntical importance to the workable administration of the \ntax laws.\u201d  That is incorrect.  As the petition explains, \nthere are tens of thousands of Section 6330 proceedings \neach year, see Pet. 16-17, and the question presented \narises each time \u201cthere is no longer a live dispute over \nthe proposed levy that gave rise to [such a] proceeding,\u201d \nPet. I.  Contrary to respondent\u2019s contention (Br. in Opp. \n32-33), moreover, the decision below threatens signifi-\n\n11 \n \ncant practical consequences\u2014not only by expanding the \nscope of Section 6330 proceedings far beyond what Con-\ngress contemplated, see Pet. 17, but also by embracing \na theory of \u201cimplicit\u201d Tax Court jurisdiction unbounded \nby any statutory text, Pet. App. 20a.\n*  *  *  *  * \nFor the foregoing reasons and those stated in the  \npetition for a writ of certiorari, the petition should be \ngranted. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nBRIAN H.

The jurisdiction of this Court rests on 28 \nU.S.C. 1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent statutory provisions are reprinted in an \nappendix to this brief.  App., infra, 1a-9a.  \nINTRODUCTION \nThe federal tax system operates on a simple default \npremise: pay now, dispute later.  In 1998, Congress en-\nacted a narrow exception to that rule.  If the Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS) seeks to levy on\u2014that is, affirm-\natively seize and sell\u2014a taxpayer\u2019s property, the IRS \ngenerally must provide the taxpayer with pre-levy notice \nand an opportunity for a hearing before the IRS Indepen-\ndent Office of Appeals (Appeals Office).  26 U.S.C. 6330.  \nThe Appeals Office makes a \u201cdetermination\u201d whether the \nIRS may proceed with \u201cthe levy action[] which [is] the \nsubject of the requested hearing.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3) \nand (e)(1).  A taxpayer disappointed with the outcome \nof the pre-levy hearing may \u201cpetition the Tax Court for \nreview of such determination.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1).   \nThis case presents the question whether a Section \n6330 proceeding in the Tax Court becomes moot when \nthere is no longer a live controversy over the levy.  Here, \nthe IRS initially proposed a levy on respondent\u2019s prop-\nerty, and she initiated a Section 6330 proceeding for \npre-deprivation review.  But before the Tax Court\u2019s re-\nview concluded, the IRS determined that respondent\u2019s \nintervening, additional payments meant that she no long-\ner owed any additional tax, so the IRS no longer sought \nto collect by levying on her property.   \nThat development mooted the proceeding for pre-\nlevy review.  When the IRS has decided not to pursue its \nproposed levy, the taxpayer has already received \u201cthe \nvery relief [she] ostensibly sought\u201d by requesting a pre-\ndeprivation hearing.  Willson v. Commissioner, 805 \nF.3d 316, 321 (D.C. Cir. 2015).  The Tax Court can pro-\n\n3 \n \nvide no further relief, and the Section 6330 proceeding \nmust end.  \nThe text of Section 6330 makes clear that it provides \na narrow path for review of a proposed levy\u2014not a \nmeans to circumvent the usual methods of disputing a \ntaxpayer\u2019s liability.  The decision below thus erred in \nconcluding that the Tax Court could still address wheth-\ner respondent has any \u201cunderlying tax liability\u201d\u2014an is-\nsue that may be considered under 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B) \nwhen evaluating whether a proposed levy may proceed.  \nWhen there is no proposed levy to adjudicate, the ques-\ntion of tax liability ceases to be an \u201cunderlying\u201d one.  \nNor does the Tax Court have jurisdiction to issue de-\nclaratory relief separate from its ability to enjoin the \nproposed levy that is \u201cthe subject of the requested hear-\ning.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(1). \nThat there is no longer review under Section 6330 \ndoes not foreclose judicial review of the IRS\u2019s handling \nof respondent\u2019s taxes.  Rather, as respondent has al-\nready acknowledged (Br. in Opp. 2, 4, 13, 16, 25), she \ncan proceed under the general rule and dispute the as-\nsessment and collection of her taxes in a refund suit.  \nBecause the court of appeals\u2019 contrary decision thwarts \nCongress\u2019s distinction between that general rule and \nthe narrow exception for pre-levy review, this Court \nshould reverse. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal Background \n1. The traditional mechanism for a taxpayer to dis-\npute the assessment or collection of a federal tax is a \npost-payment suit for a refund.  See CIC Servs., LLC v. \nIRS, 593 U.S. 209, 212 (2021) (\u201c[A] person can typically \nchallenge a federal tax only after he pays it, by suing for \na refund.\u201d).  To bring a refund suit, a taxpayer must first \n\n4 \n \npay the tax and then request a refund from the IRS.   \n26 U.S.C. 6402(a), 6511; 26 C.F.R. 301.6402\u20132; Flora v. \nUnited States, 357 U.S. 63, 64-75 (1958), aff\u200a\u2019d on reh\u2019g, \n362 U.S. 145 (1960).  If the refund is denied, the tax-\npayer may sue to recover the disputed amount.  28 \nU.S.C. 1346(a)(1); see 26 U.S.C. 6532, 7422(a); 28 U.S.C. \n1491(a)(1); United States v. Clintwood Elkhorn Mining \nCo., 553 U.S. 1, 4 (2008); see also, e.g., G.M. Leasing \nCorp. v. United States, 429 U.S. 338, 352 n.18 (1977) \n(collecting cases for the proposition that post-payment \nreview of a tax liability comports with due process).  \nFor certain taxes, however, Congress has also pro-\nvided a pre-assessment avenue for judicial review.  Spe-\ncifically, for income, estate, gift, and various other \ntaxes, Congress has directed the IRS to issue a \u201cnotice \nof  * * *  deficiency\u201d to a taxpayer who has failed to re-\nport a tax properly.  26 U.S.C. 6212(a).  The taxpayer \nmay then file a petition for redetermination in the Tax \nCourt.  26 U.S.C. 6213.  With certain exceptions, the \nIRS may not attempt to collect the tax at issue before \nthe time for seeking judicial review has expired or while \nsuch review is pending.  26 U.S.C. 6213(a).  \nThe Internal Revenue Code and other statutes chan-\nnel judicial review of challenges to tax assessment and \ncollection to those prescribed mechanisms.  The Tax \nAnti-Injunction Act, 26 U.S.C. 7421(a), and the tax ex-\nception to the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. \n2201(a), generally preclude suits for injunctive and de-\nclaratory relief regarding the assessment or collection \nof taxes.  And 26 U.S.C. 7422(a) precludes suits to re-\ncover taxes alleged to have been assessed or collected \nunlawfully before a taxpayer has properly sought a re-\nfund from the IRS. \n\n5 \n \n2. Following assessment, if a taxpayer who is \u201cliable \nto pay any tax neglects or refuses to pay,\u201d the IRS may \ngenerally \u201ccollect such tax\u201d by \u201clevy[ing] upon\u201d the tax-\npayer\u2019s property, i.e., seizing and selling it.  26 U.S.C. \n6331(a); see 26 U.S.C. 6331(b) (defining \u201clevy\u201d to \u201cin-\nclude[] the power of distraint and seizure by any means,\u201d \nand permitting the sale of \u201csuch property or rights to \nproperty\u201d); see also 26 U.S.C. 6321 (providing for tax \nliens).  Certain types of property\u2014including, with some \nexceptions, residences, welfare and unemployment ben-\nefits, and particular pensions\u2014are exempt from levies.  \nSee 26 U.S.C. 6334. \nBefore 1998, the Internal Revenue Code authorized \nthe IRS to levy upon taxpayer property without any \nprior opportunity for a hearing or other pre-collection \nprocess, so long as adequate post-deprivation proce-\ndures were available.  See Phillips v. Commissioner, \n283 U.S. 589, 595 (1931); 26 U.S.C. 6331(d) (1994).  In \n1998, however, Congress established procedures that \nthe IRS generally must follow before levying.  See Tax-\npayer Bill of Rights 3 (Taxpayer Bill of Rights), Pub. L. \nNo. 105-206, Tit. III, \u00a7 3401(b), 112 Stat. 747-749 (26 \nU.S.C. 6330); see also id. \u00a7 3401(a), 112 Stat. 746-747 (26 \nU.S.C. 6320) (substantially similar framework for IRS \nfiling of a notice of federal tax lien).  \nThose procedures are codified in Section 6330 of the \nCode, which is entitled \u201c[n]otice and opportunity for \nhearing before levy.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330.  Under those pro-\ncedures, \u201c[n]o levy may be made\u201d unless the IRS pro-\nvides the taxpayer with 30 days\u2019 notice and the oppor-\ntunity to request a hearing.  26 U.S.C. 6330(a)(1); see 26 \nU.S.C. 6330(a)(2) and (3).   \nIf the taxpayer makes such a request, an administra-\ntive hearing to review the proposed levy\u2014sometimes \n\n6 \n \ncalled a \u201ccollection due process hearing,\u201d Boechler, P.C. \nv. Commissioner, 596 U.S. 199, 202 (2022)\u2014is con-\nducted by an impartial officer in the Appeals Office.  26 \nU.S.C. 6330(b).  The taxpayer\u2019s request for a hearing \nsuspends \u201cthe levy actions which are the subject of the \nrequested hearing\u201d as well as the running of specified \nlimitations periods.  26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(1).   \nAt the hearing, the taxpayer may raise \u201cany relevant \nissue relating to the unpaid tax or the proposed levy,\u201d \nincluding \u201cchallenges to the appropriateness of collec-\ntion actions\u201d and \u201coffers of collection alternatives.\u201d  26 \nU.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(A)(ii) and (iii); see 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(4) \n(excluding certain issues that were previously litigated \nor qualify as frivolous).  If the taxpayer \u201cdid not receive \nany statutory notice of deficiency for [the relevant] tax \nliability or did not otherwise have an opportunity to dis-\npute such tax liability,\u201d she also may raise \u201cchallenges \nto the existence or amount of the underlying tax liabil-\nity.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B). \nAt the conclusion of a Section 6330 hearing, the  \nAppeals Office issues its \u201cdetermination,\u201d 26 U.S.C. \n6330(c)(3), which is \u201ca written notice\u201d reflecting wheth-\ner \u201ccollection by way of levy may proceed.\u201d  Lunsford v. \nCommissioner, 117 T.C. 159, 164-165 (2001).  The Ap-\npeals Office reaches its determination after considering \nstatutorily delineated factors, including whether the re-\nquirements of applicable law or administrative proce-\ndure have been met, 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(1) and (3)(A); the \nissues raised by the taxpayer, 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2) and \n(3); and \u201cwhether any proposed collection action bal-\nances the need for the efficient collection of taxes with \nthe legitimate concern of the [taxpayer] that any collec-\ntion action be no more intrusive than necessary,\u201d 26 \nU.S.C. 6330(c)(3)(C).   \n\n7 \n \nA taxpayer who is dissatisfied with a determination \nsustaining a levy may petition the United States Tax \nCourt \u201cfor review of such determination (and the Tax \nCourt shall have jurisdiction with respect to such mat-\nter).\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1).  The Tax Court\u2019s decision, \nin turn, is subject to review by a federal court of ap-\npeals.  26 U.S.C. 7482(a)(1). \n3. Although a taxpayer\u2019s request for a Section 6330 \nhearing suspends \u201cthe levy actions which are the sub-\nject of the requested hearing\u201d and certain limitations \nperiods, 26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(1), other mechanisms for tax \ncollection may proceed.  Most relevant here, when a tax-\npayer overpays the tax owed for a particular year, the \nIRS \u201cmay credit the amount of such overpayment\u201d \nagainst \u201cany liability in respect of an internal revenue \ntax on the part of the person who made the overpay-\nment\u201d instead of refunding that amount to the taxpayer.  \n26 U.S.C. 6402(a).   \nThat application of overpayment credits\u2014sometimes \nreferred to as an \u201coffset\u201d\u2014is an administrative action \ndistinct from the collection of a tax by a levy or lien on \nthe taxpayer\u2019s property.  See Belloff v. Commissioner, \n996 F.2d 607, 616 (2d Cir. 1993); Boyd v. Commissioner, \n124 T.C. 296, 300 (2005); 26 C.F.R. 301.6330\u20131(g)(2),  \nQ & A-G3.  A taxpayer may challenge the application of \ncredits through the traditional mechanism for disputing \nthe collection of a federal tax: filing a refund claim with \nthe IRS and, if necessary, a refund suit.  See 26 U.S.C. \n7422(a) and (d). \nB. The Present Controversy \n1. From 1993 to 2014, respondent was married to \nPatrick Gennardo.  Pet. App. 7a.  This case concerns the \n2010 tax year, for which respondent and Gennardo ulti-\nmately filed separate tax returns.  Ibid.  \n\n8 \n \na. In 2010 and 2011, respondent and Gennardo made \ntwo estimated tax payments, totaling $50,000, to the \nIRS for tax year 2010.  Pet. App. 8a.  First, the couple \nsubmitted an estimated tax payment of $20,000.  Ibid.  \nThe accompanying Form 1040-ES identified both of \ntheir names, but it did not indicate that they would be \nfiling separate returns, and it provided no instructions \non how to allocate the payment between them.  C.A. \nApp. 274, 314.  Second, Gennardo submitted a $30,000 \nbank check, which identified only Gennardo as the re-\nmitter.  Pet. App. 8a; see C.A. App. 274, 315.  The sub-\nject line of the accompanying cover letter identified \nboth respondent and Gennardo, but neither the check \nnor any accompanying documentation instructed the \nIRS to allocate any part of that payment to respondent.  \nC.A. App. 275, 315, 633, 638. \nb. On September 12, 2012, the couple filed separate \n(and untimely) 2010 federal income-tax returns.  Pet. \nApp. 7a; see C.A. App. 316-381.  Respondent did not claim \nany of the $50,000 in estimated tax payments on her re-\nturn, while Gennardo claimed $10,000 in estimated tax \npayments on his return.  C.A. App. 317, 331. Respond-\nent\u2019s and Gennardo\u2019s tax returns were prepared by the \nsame tax preparer.  Id. at 277. \nOn the same day that they submitted their separate \ntax returns, Gennardo made a written compromise offer \nto the IRS about his outstanding federal tax liabilities \nfor tax years 2007 through 2011.  C.A. App. 278, 382.  \nAlthough the offer covered years in which respondent \nand Gennardo had filed joint tax returns, Gennardo\u2019s  \noffer-in-compromise did not include respond\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

App., infra, 1a-9a.  \nINTRODUCTION \nThe federal tax system operates on a simple default \npremise: pay now, dispute later.  In 1998, Congress en-\nacted a narrow exception to that rule.  If the Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS) seeks to levy on\u2014that is, affirm-\natively seize and sell\u2014a taxpayer\u2019s property, the IRS \ngenerally must provide the taxpayer with pre-levy notice \nand an opportunity for a hearing before the IRS Indepen-\ndent Office of Appeals (Appeals Office).  26 U.S.C. 6330.  \nThe Appeals Office makes a \u201cdetermination\u201d whether the \nIRS may proceed with \u201cthe levy action[] which [is] the \nsubject of the requested hearing.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3) \nand (e)(1).  A taxpayer disappointed with the outcome \nof the pre-levy hearing may \u201cpetition the Tax Court for \nreview of such determination.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1).   \nThis case presents the question whether a Section \n6330 proceeding in the Tax Court becomes moot when \nthere is no longer a live controversy over the levy.  Here, \nthe IRS initially proposed a levy on respondent\u2019s prop-\nerty, and she initiated a Section 6330 proceeding for \npre-deprivation review.  But before the Tax Court\u2019s re-\nview concluded, the IRS determined that respondent\u2019s \nintervening, additional payments meant that she no long-\ner owed any additional tax, so the IRS no longer sought \nto collect by levying on her property.   \nThat development mooted the proceeding for pre-\nlevy review.  When the IRS has decided not to pursue its \nproposed levy, the taxpayer has already received \u201cthe \nvery relief [she] ostensibly sought\u201d by requesting a pre-\ndeprivation hearing.  Willson v. Commissioner, 805 \nF.3d 316, 321 (D.C. Cir. 2015).  The Tax Court can pro-\n\n3 \n \nvide no further relief, and the Section 6330 proceeding \nmust end.  \nThe text of Section 6330 makes clear that it provides \na narrow path for review of a proposed levy\u2014not a \nmeans to circumvent the usual methods of disputing a \ntaxpayer\u2019s liability.  The decision below thus erred in \nconcluding that the Tax Court could still address wheth-\ner respondent has any \u201cunderlying tax liability\u201d\u2014an is-\nsue that may be considered under 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B) \nwhen evaluating whether a proposed levy may proceed.  \nWhen there is no proposed levy to adjudicate, the ques-\ntion of tax liability ceases to be an \u201cunderlying\u201d one.  \nNor does the Tax Court have jurisdiction to issue de-\nclaratory relief separate from its ability to enjoin the \nproposed levy that is \u201cthe subject of the requested hear-\ning.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(1). \nThat there is no longer review under Section 6330 \ndoes not foreclose judicial review of the IRS\u2019s handling \nof respondent\u2019s taxes.  Rather, as respondent has al-\nready acknowledged (Br. in Opp. 2, 4, 13, 16, 25), she \ncan proceed under the general rule and dispute the as-\nsessment and collection of her taxes in a refund suit.  \nBecause the court of appeals\u2019 contrary decision thwarts \nCongress\u2019s distinction between that general rule and \nthe narrow exception for pre-levy review, this Court \nshould reverse. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal Background \n1. The traditional mechanism for a taxpayer to dis-\npute the assessment or collection of a federal tax is a \npost-payment suit for a refund.  See CIC Servs., LLC v. \nIRS, 593 U.S. 209, 212 (2021) (\u201c[A] person can typically \nchallenge a federal tax only after he pays it, by suing for \na refund.\u201d).  To bring a refund suit, a taxpayer must first \n\n4 \n \npay the tax and then request a refund from the IRS.   \n26 U.S.C. 6402(a), 6511; 26 C.F.R. 301.6402\u20132; Flora v. \nUnited States, 357 U.S. 63, 64-75 (1958), aff\u200a\u2019d on reh\u2019g, \n362 U.S. 145 (1960).  If the refund is denied, the tax-\npayer may sue to recover the disputed amount.  28 \nU.S.C. 1346(a)(1); see 26 U.S.C. 6532, 7422(a); 28 U.S.C. \n1491(a)(1); United States v. Clintwood Elkhorn Mining \nCo., 553 U.S. 1, 4 (2008); see also, e.g., G.M. Leasing \nCorp. v. United States, 429 U.S. 338, 352 n.18 (1977) \n(collecting cases for the proposition that post-payment \nreview of a tax liability comports with due process).  \nFor certain taxes, however, Congress has also pro-\nvided a pre-assessment avenue for judicial review.  Spe-\ncifically, for income, estate, gift, and various other \ntaxes, Congress has directed the IRS to issue a \u201cnotice \nof  * * *  deficiency\u201d to a taxpayer who has failed to re-\nport a tax properly.  26 U.S.C. 6212(a).  The taxpayer \nmay then file a petition for redetermination in the Tax \nCourt.  26 U.S.C. 6213.  With certain exceptions, the \nIRS may not attempt to collect the tax at issue before \nthe time for seeking judicial review has expired or while \nsuch review is pending.  26 U.S.C. 6213(a).  \nThe Internal Revenue Code and other statutes chan-\nnel judicial review of challenges to tax assessment and \ncollection to those prescribed mechanisms.  The Tax \nAnti-Injunction Act, 26 U.S.C. 7421(a), and the tax ex-\nception to the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. \n2201(a), generally preclude suits for injunctive and de-\nclaratory relief regarding the assessment or collection \nof taxes.  And 26 U.S.C. 7422(a) precludes suits to re-\ncover taxes alleged to have been assessed or collected \nunlawfully before a taxpayer has properly sought a re-\nfund from the IRS. \n\n5 \n \n2. Following assessment, if a taxpayer who is \u201cliable \nto pay any tax neglects or refuses to pay,\u201d the IRS may \ngenerally \u201ccollect such tax\u201d by \u201clevy[ing] upon\u201d the tax-\npayer\u2019s property, i.e., seizing and selling it.  26 U.S.C. \n6331(a); see 26 U.S.C. 6331(b) (defining \u201clevy\u201d to \u201cin-\nclude[] the power of distraint and seizure by any means,\u201d \nand permitting the sale of \u201csuch property or rights to \nproperty\u201d); see also 26 U.S.C. 6321 (providing for tax \nliens).  Certain types of property\u2014including, with some \nexceptions, residences, welfare and unemployment ben-\nefits, and particular pensions\u2014are exempt from levies.  \nSee 26 U.S.C. 6334. \nBefore 1998, the Internal Revenue Code authorized \nthe IRS to levy upon taxpayer property without any \nprior opportunity for a hearing or other pre-collection \nprocess, so long as adequate post-deprivation proce-\ndures were available.  See Phillips v. Commissioner, \n283 U.S. 589, 595 (1931); 26 U.S.C. 6331(d) (1994).  In \n1998, however, Congress established procedures that \nthe IRS generally must follow before levying.  See Tax-\npayer Bill of Rights 3 (Taxpayer Bill of Rights), Pub. L. \nNo. 105-206, Tit. III, \u00a7 3401(b), 112 Stat. 747-749 (26 \nU.S.C. 6330); see also id. \u00a7 3401(a), 112 Stat. 746-747 (26 \nU.S.C. 6320) (substantially similar framework for IRS \nfiling of a notice of federal tax lien).  \nThose procedures are codified in Section 6330 of the \nCode, which is entitled \u201c[n]otice and opportunity for \nhearing before levy.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330.  Under those pro-\ncedures, \u201c[n]o levy may be made\u201d unless the IRS pro-\nvides the taxpayer with 30 days\u2019 notice and the oppor-\ntunity to request a hearing.  26 U.S.C. 6330(a)(1); see 26 \nU.S.C. 6330(a)(2) and (3).   \nIf the taxpayer makes such a request, an administra-\ntive hearing to review the proposed levy\u2014sometimes \n\n6 \n \ncalled a \u201ccollection due process hearing,\u201d Boechler, P.C. \nv. Commissioner, 596 U.S. 199, 202 (2022)\u2014is con-\nducted by an impartial officer in the Appeals Office.  26 \nU.S.C. 6330(b).  The taxpayer\u2019s request for a hearing \nsuspends \u201cthe levy actions which are the subject of the \nrequested hearing\u201d as well as the running of specified \nlimitations periods.  26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(1).   \nAt the hearing, the taxpayer may raise \u201cany relevant \nissue relating to the unpaid tax or the proposed levy,\u201d \nincluding \u201cchallenges to the appropriateness of collec-\ntion actions\u201d and \u201coffers of collection alternatives.\u201d  26 \nU.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(A)(ii) and (iii); see 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(4) \n(excluding certain issues that were previously litigated \nor qualify as frivolous).  If the taxpayer \u201cdid not receive \nany statutory notice of deficiency for [the relevant] tax \nliability or did not otherwise have an opportunity to dis-\npute such tax liability,\u201d she also may raise \u201cchallenges \nto the existence or amount of the underlying tax liabil-\nity.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B). \nAt the conclusion of a Section 6330 hearing, the  \nAppeals Office issues its \u201cdetermination,\u201d 26 U.S.C. \n6330(c)(3), which is \u201ca written notice\u201d reflecting wheth-\ner \u201ccollection by way of levy may proceed.\u201d  Lunsford v. \nCommissioner, 117 T.C. 159, 164-165 (2001).  The Ap-\npeals Office reaches its determination after considering \nstatutorily delineated factors, including whether the re-\nquirements of applicable law or administrative proce-\ndure have been met, 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(1) and (3)(A); the \nissues raised by the taxpayer, 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2) and \n(3); and \u201cwhether any proposed collection action bal-\nances the need for the efficient collection of taxes with \nthe legitimate concern of the [taxpayer] that any collec-\ntion action be no more intrusive than necessary,\u201d 26 \nU.S.C. 6330(c)(3)(C).   \n\n7 \n \nA taxpayer who is dissatisfied with a determination \nsustaining a levy may petition the United States Tax \nCourt \u201cfor review of such determination (and the Tax \nCourt shall have jurisdiction with respect to such mat-\nter).\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1).  The Tax Court\u2019s decision, \nin turn, is subject to review by a federal court of ap-\npeals.  26 U.S.C. 7482(a)(1). \n3. Although a taxpayer\u2019s request for a Section 6330 \nhearing suspends \u201cthe levy actions which are the sub-\nject of the requested hearing\u201d and certain limitations \nperiods, 26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(1), other mechanisms for tax \ncollection may proceed.  Most relevant here, when a tax-\npayer overpays the tax owed for a particular year, the \nIRS \u201cmay credit the amount of such overpayment\u201d \nagainst \u201cany liability in respect of an internal revenue \ntax on the part of the person who made the overpay-\nment\u201d instead of refunding that amount to the taxpayer.  \n26 U.S.C. 6402(a).   \nThat application of overpayment credits\u2014sometimes \nreferred to as an \u201coffset\u201d\u2014is an administrative action \ndistinct from the collection of a tax by a levy or lien on \nthe taxpayer\u2019s property.  See Belloff v. Commissioner, \n996 F.2d 607, 616 (2d Cir. 1993); Boyd v. Commissioner, \n124 T.C. 296, 300 (2005); 26 C.F.R. 301.6330\u20131(g)(2),  \nQ & A-G3.  A taxpayer may challenge the application of \ncredits through the traditional mechanism for disputing \nthe collection of a federal tax: filing a refund claim with \nthe IRS and, if necessary, a refund suit.  See 26 U.S.C. \n7422(a) and (d). \nB. The Present Controversy \n1. From 1993 to 2014, respondent was married to \nPatrick Gennardo.  Pet. App. 7a.  This case concerns the \n2010 tax year, for which respondent and Gennardo ulti-\nmately filed separate tax returns.  Ibid.  \n\n8 \n \na. In 2010 and 2011, respondent and Gennardo made \ntwo estimated tax payments, totaling $50,000, to the \nIRS for tax year 2010.  Pet. App. 8a.  First, the couple \nsubmitted an estimated tax payment of $20,000.  Ibid.  \nThe accompanying Form 1040-ES identified both of \ntheir names, but it did not indicate that they would be \nfiling separate returns, and it provided no instructions \non how to allocate the payment between them.  C.A. \nApp. 274, 314.  Second, Gennardo submitted a $30,000 \nbank check, which identified only Gennardo as the re-\nmitter.  Pet. App. 8a; see C.A. App. 274, 315.  The sub-\nject line of the accompanying cover letter identified \nboth respondent and Gennardo, but neither the check \nnor any accompanying documentation instructed the \nIRS to allocate any part of that payment to respondent.  \nC.A. App. 275, 315, 633, 638. \nb. On September 12, 2012, the couple filed separate \n(and untimely) 2010 federal income-tax returns.  Pet. \nApp. 7a; see C.A. App. 316-381.  Respondent did not claim \nany of the $50,000 in estimated tax payments on her re-\nturn, while Gennardo claimed $10,000 in estimated tax \npayments on his return.  C.A. App. 317, 331. Respond-\nent\u2019s and Gennardo\u2019s tax returns were prepared by the \nsame tax preparer.  Id. at 277. \nOn the same day that they submitted their separate \ntax returns, Gennardo made a written compromise offer \nto the IRS about his outstanding federal tax liabilities \nfor tax years 2007 through 2011.  C.A. App. 278, 382.  \nAlthough the offer covered years in which respondent \nand Gennardo had filed joint tax returns, Gennardo\u2019s  \noffer-in-compromise did not include respondent.  C.A. \nApp. 386.  Consistent with the terms of the offer and \nIRS rules governing payments related to pending of-\nfers, the IRS applied the full $50,000 in estimated tax \n\n9 \n \npayments to Gennardo\u2019s separate account.  Pet. App. \n8a; see C.A. App. 277-279, 310, 384, 466, 468, 473, 662; \nI.R.S. Notice 2006-68, 2006-31 I.R.B. 105.   \nc. In November 2012, respondent filed an amended \nreturn for the 2010 tax year showing that she owed an \nadditional $27,682.  Pet. App. 9a; see C.A. App. 279, 475, \n477.  For the first time, respondent\u2019s amended return \nalso claimed for herself the full $50,000 in estimated tax \npayments, yielding a claimed overpayment of $21,918 \nfor the 2010 tax year.  Pet. App. 9a; see C.A. App. 280, \n475.  Because the IRS had already allocated the $50,000 \nto Gennardo, it declined to apply the estimated pay-\nments to respondent\u2019s account.  C.A. App. 280.  Instead, \nthe IRS assessed the tax that respondent had reported \non her amended return, along with interest and a late-\nfiling penalty of $7020.  Ibid.   \n2. a. In 2013, the IRS sent respondent a notice and \ndemand for payment of her balance due.  C.A. App. 280.  \nRespondent failed to pay, and the IRS sent her a notice \nof its intent to levy on her property to collect the unpaid \ntaxes.  Pet. App. 70a-75a; C.A. App. 571-573.   \nRespondent invoked her right under Section 6330 to \nchallenge the proposed levy in a hearing before the Ap-\npeals Office.  Pet. App. 10a; C.A. App. 567-570.  She con-\ntended that the IRS should have applied the full $50,000 \nin estimated tax payments to her account, which would \nhave satisfied her self-reported underlying tax liability \nand resulted in a refund.  Pet. App. 10a; C.A. App. 567.   \nIn 2014, after a hearing, the Appeals Office issued a \ndetermination sustaining the IRS\u2019s proposed levy, ex-\nplaining that the estimated tax payments could not be \napplied to respondent\u2019s account because they had been \ncredited to Gennardo\u2019s account.  Pet. App. 61a-67a.  Re-\nspondent petitioned the Tax Court for review, and in \n\n10 \n \n2016, the Tax Court remanded to the Appeals Office for \nclarification of several issues.  C.A. App. 16; Pet. App. \n50a-60a.  On remand, the Appeals Office reaffirmed its \nprior determination to sustain the proposed levy, ex-\nplaining in a 2017 supplemental notice of determination \nthat the estimated tax payments had been properly al-\nlocated to Gennardo.  Pet. App. 44a-49a. \nb. While respondent\u2019s pre-levy proceedings were \npending before the Appeals Office and the Tax Court, \nrespondent overpaid her taxes for 2013 and subsequent \ntax years.  Pet. App. 12a-13a.  The IRS exercised its au-\nthority under Section 6402(a) to credit her overpay-\nments in those years against her 2010 tax liability.  Ibid.  \nBy April 15, 2019, the credits transferred from later tax \nyears had reduced the balance due on respondent\u2019s 2010 \nliability to $0.  Id. at 13a. \nIn March 2020, the IRS moved to dismiss as moot the \npre-levy proceeding before the Tax Court, explaining \nthat respondent\u2019s 2010 tax liability had been satisfied \nand the IRS therefore \u201cno longer intend[ed] to pursue \nthe proposed collection action.\u201d  Pet. App. 42a; see C.A. \nDoc. 5-4, at 450 (July 21, 2022) (motion to dismiss).   \nThe Tax Court granted the motion and dismissed the \ncase.  Pet. App. 40a-43a.  The court explained that the \n\u201ccase is moot\u201d \u201c[b]ecause there is no unpaid liability for \nthe determination year upon which a levy could be \nbased, and [the IRS] is no longer pursuing the proposed \ncollection action.\u201d  Id. at 43a (citing McLane v. Commis-\nsioner, 24 F.4th 316 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 143 S. Ct. \n408 (2022); Greene-Thapedi v. Commissioner, 126 T.C. \n1, 7 (2006)).  The court acknowledged that respondent \ncontinued to argue that the IRS should have credited \nthe estimated payments to her, but the court reasoned \nthat because it did not \u201chave jurisdiction to determine \n\n11 \n \nan overpayment or to order a refund or credit of tax \npaid in a section 6330 proceeding, this is not the proper \nforum to determine whether, and the extent to which, if \nany, the underlying liability has been overpaid.\u201d  Ibid.  \nThe court observed that respondent could still \u201cpursue \nany refund to which she might be entitled through tra-\nditional Federal income procedures, including if neces-\nsary, initiating a case in a different Federal court.\u201d  \nIbid. \n3. The court of appeals vacated the Tax Court\u2019s or-\nder of dismissal and remanded for the Tax Court to de-\ntermine whether respondent was entitled to the esti-\nmated tax payments that the IRS had allocated to Gen-\nnardo.  Pet. App. 1a-39a.   \nAlthough the court of appeals acknowledged that \n\u201cthe Tax Court need not hear a moot case,\u201d Pet. App. \n16a, the court of appeals held that the proceedings be-\nfore the Tax Court are \u201cnot moot,\u201d id. at 2a.  In a part \nof the opinion joined by only two members of the panel, \nthe court of appeals concluded that the Tax Court has \njurisdiction in a Section 6330 pre-levy proceeding to re-\nview a taxpayer\u2019s \u201cunderlying tax liability,\u201d id. at 26a \n(quoting 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B)), and that the statute \ndoes not \u201csuggest that a taxpayer\u2019s right to challenge \nthe existence or amount of her underlying tax becomes \nmoot once the levy is no longer being enforced or the \ntax is satisfied,\u201d id. at 26a-27a.  The court of appeals \nreasoned that even though the IRS is no longer seeking \nto take respondent\u2019s property by levy, the Tax Court \nretains jurisdiction to \u201cdeclare that [respondent] had a \nright to the estimated payments.\u201d  Id. at 37a.  The court \nof appeals acknowledged that its holding is contrary to \nthose of the Fourth and D.C. Circuits, which have held \nthat a Section 6330 proceeding in the Tax Court is moot \n\n12 \n \nwhen the IRS no longer seeks to levy on a taxpayer\u2019s \nproperty.  Id. at 27a (citing McLane, 24 F.4th at 319 (4th \nCir.); Willson v. Commissioner, 805 F.3d 316, 321 (D.C. \nCir. 2015)).   \nIn a part of the opinion joined by all three members \nof the panel, the court of appeals alternatively con-\ncluded that the case is not moot on the theory that the \nTax Court has jurisdiction to determine whether the \nIRS validly exercised its authority under Section 6402 \nto use respondent\u2019s later-year overpayments to offset \nher 2010 tax liability.  Pet. App. 19a-25a.  Respondent \nhad made only a passing reference to the validity of the \noffsets in her reply brief, see Resp. C.A. Reply Br. 16-\n17, but after oral argument, the court of appeals ap-\npointed an amicus to address the question (along with \nsix other issues), C.A. Doc. 45 (June 1, 2023).   \nIn holding that the Tax Court may review the appli-\ncation of credits under Section 6402, the court of ap-\npeals relied on \u201can implicit grant\u201d of jurisdiction, ob-\nserving that \u201c[i]t may be that Congress has not explic-\nitly granted the Tax Court such power.\u201d  Pet. App. 20a.  \nSpecifically, the court of appeals reasoned that Section \n6402 \u201ccarries forward the common law of setoffs,\u201d which \nmeans that the Tax Court has implicit jurisdiction to re-\nview the application of credits in a pre-levy proceeding, \neven absent a proposed levy.  Id. at 21a.1   \nThe court of appeals then considered the application \nof Section 6402 credits to respondent\u2019s 2010 tax liability \nin the first instance.  Even though Section 6402 allows \n \n1  Although the court of appeals used the terms \u201coffset\u201d and \u201cset-\noff\u200a\u201d interchangeably, the statute uses \u201coffset\u201d to refer to an over-\npayment credit, see 26 U.S.C. 6402, while \u201csetoff\u200a\u201d is typically used \nto describe the common-law principle, see, e.g., United States v. \nMunsey Trust Co., 332 U.S. 234, 239 (1947). \n\n13 \n \nthe application of credits to \u201cany liability,\u201d 26 U.S.C. \n6402(a), the court determined that the offset was \u201cinva-\nlid and without legal effect\u201d because common-law setoff \nprinciples do not apply to disputed debts, Pet. App. 25a.  \nHaving concluded that respondent\u2019s \u201ctax obligation was \nnot properly set off,\u201d the court determined that her tax \nliability remains, and she may \u201cchallenge the IRS\u2019s ap-\nplication of the estimated payments\u201d in a Section 6330 \nproceeding.  Id. at 19a.   \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nA pre-levy proceeding under 26 U.S.C. 6330 is moot \nwhen there is no longer a live dispute over the proposed \nlevy that gave rise to the proceeding. \nA. The Tax Court is a court of limited jurisdiction, \ncapable of exercising only the jurisdiction expressly \nconferred on it by Congress.  The Tax Court has been \ngranted jurisdiction over a \u201cpetition  * * *  for review\u201d \nof the Appeals Office\u2019s \u201cdetermination\u201d whether a par-\nticular levy may proceed.  26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1).  When \nthe IRS no longer seeks to proceed by levy\u2014such that \nthere is no live dispute over \u201cthe levy action[] which  \n[is] the subject of the requested hearing,\u201d 26 U.S.C. \n6330(e)(1)\u2014the taxpayer\u2019s challenge is moot, and the \nTax Court lacks jurisdiction to resolve it. \nAt every step in the Section 6330 process, the statu-\ntory text squarely focuses on the question whether a \nlevy may go forward.  The statute mandates that the \ntaxpayer receive notice and an opportunity for a hear-\ning \u201cbefore levy\u201d; it requires that certain levy-related \ninformation be conveyed in the notice; and it instructs \nthat the Appeals Office\u2019s \u201cdetermination\u201d must \u201ctake \ninto consideration,\u201d inter alia, \u201cwhether any proposed \ncollection action balances the need for the efficient col-\nlection of taxes with the legitimate concern of the per-\n\n14 \n \nson that any collection action be no more intrusive than \nnecessary.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(a) and (c)(3)(C).  Once the \nAppeals Office determines whether the levy may pro-\nceed, Section 6330 authorizes the Tax Court to review \n\u201csuch determination.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1).  But where \nthere is no longer a live dispute over a levy, there is \nnothing left for the Tax Court to do, and the case is \nmoot. \nB. That understanding is consistent with Section \n6330\u2019s history and its role in the Internal Revenue Code.  \nCongress enacted Section 6330 to ensure that taxpayers \nhave a pre-deprivation opportunity to contest levies.  \nSection 6330 was not designed to, and did not, provide a \nbroader means for taxpayers to dispute their tax liabil-\nity untethered from proposed levies. \nC. The court of appeals\u2019 and respondent\u2019s contrary \narguments lack merit.  Both the court and respondent \nhave suggested that the Tax Court retains jurisdiction \nabsent a live dispute over a levy because, in some cir-\ncumstances, Section 6330(c)(2)(B) permits a taxpayer to \nraise at a pre-levy hearing \u201cchallenges to the existence \nor amount of the underlying tax liability.\u201d  26 U.S.C. \n6330(c)(2)(B); see Pet. App. 19a; Br. in Opp. 14.  But, as \nthat text underscores, a taxpayer\u2019s \u201cunderlying tax lia-\nbility\u201d must underlie the proposed collection action\u2014\nthat is, the levy.  The statute thus does not support treat-\ning a taxpayer\u2019s challenge to her \u201cunderlying tax liabil-\nity\u201d as providing a freestanding basis for Tax Court ju-\nrisdiction.  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B).  Rather, where Sec-\ntion 6330(c)(2)(B) applies, it simply supplies one \u201ccon-\nsideration\u201d that the Appeals Office must \u201ctake into\u201d ac-\ncount when issuing the \u201cdetermination\u201d whether the \nproposed levy may proceed.  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B) and \n(3).  When there is no live dispute over a proposed levy, \n\n15 \n \nthere is no Tax Court jurisdiction to address the \u201cun-\nderlying\u201d question.  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B). \nThe court of appeals alternatively held that the Tax \nCourt has \u201cimplicit\u201d jurisdiction to review the IRS\u2019s al-\nlocation of respondent\u2019s later-year overpayments to off-\nset her tax liability.  Pet. App. 20a.  Respondent has not \ndefended that rationale in this Court, and for good rea-\nson.  Congress must expressly provide for Tax Court \njurisdiction by statute, and no statute grants that court \nauthority to review Section 6402 credits in a Section \n6330 proceeding.  Even if the Tax Court could conduct \nsuch review, it still could not provide meaningful relief. \nD. This case is moot.  When respondent failed to pay \nher self-reported 2010 tax debt, the IRS proposed to \ncollect her liability by administrative levy.  Respondent \nthen invoked her right to a pre-levy proceeding under \nSection 6330.  But while that proceeding was ongoing, \nrespondent overpaid her taxes for subsequent tax \nyears, and the IRS used its authority under Section \n6402 to credit those overpayments against respondent\u2019s \n2010 tax debt.  With no debt remaining, the IRS aban-\ndoned the levy that was \u201cthe subject of the requested \nhearing,\u201d 26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(1).  The Tax Court therefore \nlacked jurisdiction to review the Appeals Office\u2019s \u201cde-\ntermination\u201d that the levy could proceed.  26 U.S.C. \n6330(d)(1).   \nThat does not, however, leave respondent without a \njudicial remedy:  She may dispute the IRS\u2019s allocation \nof the 2010 estimated payments and her subsequent \noverpayments in a refund suit, the traditional mecha-\nnism for such challenges (and the one that she could \nhave used if the IRS had never proposed a levy).  But \nabsent a live dispute over a potential levy, Section 6330 \nhas no role to play. \n\n16 \n \nARGUMENT \nA PRE-LEVY PROCEEDING UNDER 26 U.S.C. 6330 IS MOOT \nWHEN THERE IS NO LONGER A LIVE DISPUTE OVER THE \nPROPOSED LEVY THAT GAVE RISE TO THE PROCEEDING \nThe court of appeals held that a pre-levy proceeding \nunder 26 U.S.C. 6330 may continue even when there is \nno longer a live dispute over the proposed levy that gave \nrise to the proceeding.  Pet. App. 16a-39a.  That holding \nis incorrect.  Section 6330 is narrowly trained on the ap-\npropriateness of a proposed levy.  When the parties no \nlonger dispute the propriety of such a levy, the proceed-\ning becomes moot.  This Court should reverse. \nA. The Text Of Section 6330 Makes Clear That A Pre-Levy \nProceeding Is Moot When The IRS No Longer Seeks To \nLevy On A Taxpayer\u2019s Property \n1. The United States Tax Court is \u201ca court of limited \njurisdiction.\u201d  Commissioner v. McCoy, 484 U.S. 3, 7 (1987) \n(per curiam).  It may exercise \u201conly the power \u2018expressly \nconferred by Congress.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. 14a (quoting Sunoco \nInc. v. Commissioner, 663 F.3d 181, 187 (3d Cir. 2011)); \nsee 26 U.S.C. 7442; see, e.g., Commissioner v. Gooch \nMilling & Elevator Co., 320 U.S. 418, 422 (1943) (dis-\ncussing the Tax Court\u2019s predecessor, the Board of Tax \nAppeals).  \u201cThus, if a case raises a question within the \njurisdictional purview of the tax court, and that ques-\ntion is subsequently resolved, the case is moot\u201d\u2014and \nthe Tax Court lacks jurisdiction\u2014\u201cnotwithstanding the \nexistence of other live controversies between the tax-\npayer and the IRS that do not fall within the tax court\u2019s \njurisdiction.\u201d  Willson v. Commissioner, 805 F.3d 316, \n320 (D.C. Cir. 2015). \nHere, it is undisputed that the relevant jurisdiction-\nconferring provision is 26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1).  See Pet. 8; \nBr. in Opp. 14; see also Pet. App. 14a.  Section 6330 pro-\n\n17 \n \nvides a mechanism for \u201cthe taxpayer [to] challenge [a] \nlevy or offer collection alternatives\u201d before a seizure of \nthe taxpayer\u2019s property occurs.  Boechler, P.C. v. Com-\nmissioner, 596 U.S. 199, 202 (2022).  That procedure\u2014\nalong with the similar one for tax liens, 26 U.S.C. 6320\u2014\nis only necessary when the IRS is attempting to use a \nlien or levy to enforce collection of a tax liability.  If the \nIRS\u2019s Appeals Office issues a \u201cdetermination\u201d that the \nproposed levy may proceed, Section 6330(d)(1) grants \nthe Tax Court \u201cjurisdiction\u201d over the taxpayer\u2019s peti-\ntion for review of \u201csuch determination.\u201d  26 U.S.C. \n6330(d)(1); see 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3).   \nThe entire point of the Section 6330 proceeding is to \ndetermine whether the IRS may go forward with its \nproposed levy.  Thus, at every step, the statutory text is \nnarrowly focused on that question.  Congress supplied \nthe title for the section:  \u201cNotice and opportunity for \nhearing before levy.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330; Taxpayer Bill of \nRights \u00a7 3401(b), 112 Stat. 747.  Section 6330(a)(1) di-\nrectly ties the right to a hearing to the proposed levy, \nproviding that \u201c[n]o levy may be made on any property \nor right to property of any person unless the Secretary \nhas notified such person in writing of their right to a \nhearing under this section before such levy is made.\u201d  26 \nU.S.C. 6330(a)(1); see Greene-Thapedi v. Commissioner, \n126 T.C. 1, 6, 8 (2006).  Notice of the proposed levy must \nbe given \u201cnot less than 30 days before the day of the \nfirst levy,\u201d and it must include a variety of levy-related \ninformation, including \u201cthe proposed action\u201d; \u201cthe pro-\nvisions of [Title 26] relating to levy and sale of prop-\nerty\u201d; \u201cthe procedures applicable to the levy and sale of \nproperty under [Title 26]\u201d; \u201cthe administrative appeals \navailable to the taxpayer with respect to such levy and \nsale\u201d; \u201cthe alternatives available to taxpayers which \n\n18 \n \ncould prevent levy on property\u201d; and \u201cthe provisions of \n[Title 26] and procedures relating to redemption of \nproperty and release of liens on property.\u201d  26 U.S.C. \n6330(a)(2) and (3)(C).  The exceptions to Section 6330 \nalso reflect its focus on levies.  The pre-levy procedure \nis unavailable if the Secretary finds that \u201cthe collection \nof tax is in jeopardy,\u201d or if the case concerns certain lev-\nies imposed on States, \u201cdisqualified employment tax \nlev[ies],\u201d or \u201cFederal contractor lev[ies].\u201d  26 U.S.C. \n6330(f\u200a).  In those instances, \u201cthe taxpayer shall be given \nthe opportunity for the hearing described in [Section \n6330] within a reasonable period of time after the levy.\u201d  \nIbid.   \nIf no exception applies and the taxpayer invokes her \nstatutory right to a pre-levy hearing, \u201cthe levy actions \nwhich are the subject of the requested hearing\u201d and cer-\ntain limitations periods \u201cshall be suspended for the pe-\nriod during which such hearing, and appeals therein, are \npending.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(1); see 26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(2) \n(providing an exception to this rule).  Because the levy \nis the \u201csubject of the requested hearing,\u201d ibid., it would \nmake little sense for the action to continue once the IRS \nno longer seeks to enforce the levy.  \nThe outcome of the \u201cCollection Due Process\u201d or \n\u201cCDP hearing\u201d under Section 6330 is a \u201c\u200a\u2018determination\u2019 \nregarding the legitimacy of the proposed levy.\u201d  Will-\nson, 805 F.3d 318, 320 (quoting 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3)); \nsee McLane v. Commissioner, 24 F.4th 316, 318-319 \n(4th Cir.), cert. denied, 143 S. Ct. 408 (2022) (explaining \nthat \u201cthe Appeals Office determines in the first instance \nwhether the IRS\u2019s collection action may go forward\u201d).  \nAt the hearing, the taxpayer may raise \u201cany relevant \nissue relating to the unpaid tax or the proposed levy,\u201d \nincluding \u201cappropriate spousal defenses,\u201d \u201cchallenges to \n\n19 \n \nthe appropriateness of collection actions,\u201d and \u201coffers of \ncollection alternatives.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(A).  The \nAppeals Office\u2019s \u201c\u200adetermination,\u201d in turn, \u201cshall take \ninto consideration  * * *  whether any proposed collec-\ntion action balances the need for the efficient collection \nof taxes with the legitimate concern of the person that \nany collection action be no more intrusive than neces-\nsary.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3)(C).   \nIn certain cases where the taxpayer has not previ-\nously had the opportunity to dispute her tax liability, \nthe taxpayer may also raise \u201cchallenges to the existence \nor amount of the underlying tax liability.\u201d  26 U.S.C. \n6330(c)(2)(B).  But like the other issues that the tax-\npayer may raise, such challenges to the taxpayer\u2019s un-\nderlying liability are simply \u201cconsideration[s]\u201d that feed \ninto the ultimate \u201cdetermination\u201d whether the levy may \nproceed.  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3)(C).   \nIn this case, for example, the Notice of Determina-\ntion that the Appeals Office sent respondent recounted \nthe Appeals Office\u2019s \u201cdetermination  * * *  that the pro-\nposed levy  * * *  balances the need for efficient collec-\ntion of taxes with [respondent\u2019s] legitimate concern that \nany collection action be no more intrusive than neces-\nsary.\u201d  Pet. App. 63a.  And it stated that \u201cthe Final No-\ntice of [I]ntent to Levy [was therefore] being sus-\ntained.\u201d  Ibid.; see id. at 64a (\u201cAppeals has determined \nto sustain the action (levy).\u201d). \n2. The statutory focus on the appropriateness of a \nproposed levy follows the case to the Tax Court.  Section \n6330(d)(1) provides that \u201cwithin 30 days of a determina-\ntion under this section\u201d\u2014that is, a determination \nwhether the levy may go forward\u2014the taxpayer may \n\u201cpetition the Tax Court for review of such determina-\ntion.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1).  And crucially, the statute \n\n20 \n \nvests the Tax Court with \u201cjurisdiction with respect to \nsuch matter,\u201d ibid.\u2014i.e., the \u201cpetition for review of [the \nAppeals Office\u2019s] determination.\u201d  Boechler, 596 U.S. at \n204; see, e.g., Lunsford v. Commissioner, 117 T.C. 159, \n164 (2001) (explaining that the Tax Court\u2019s \u201cjurisdiction  \n* * *  is established when there is a written notice that \nembodies a determination to proceed with the collection \nof the taxes in issue, and a timely filed petition\u201d there-\nfrom).  Thus, the Tax Court proceedings\u2014like the ear-\nlier Appeals Office proceedings\u2014are squarely focused \non whether the IRS may enforce a proposed levy. \n3. Once the IRS has determined that it is no longer \nseeking to levy on the taxpayer\u2019s property, there is \nnothing left for the Tax Court to do.  Such a decision not \nto pursue a levy is \u201cthe very relief [the taxpayer] osten-\nsibly sought when [she] requested a [Section 6330] \nhearing to challenge the proposed levy in the first \nplace,\u201d and it is \u201call the relief that section 6330 author-\nizes the tax court to grant.\u201d  Willson, 805 F.3d at 321.  \nSection 6330(e)(1) provides that if a taxpayer requests \na hearing, \u201cthe levy actions which are the subject of the \nrequested hearing  * * *  shall be suspended\u201d during the \npendency of the hearing and any appeals.  26 U.S.C. \n6330(e)(1).  The statute further states that \u201c[n]otwith-\nstanding the provisions of section 7421(a)\u201d\u2014the Tax \nAnti-Injunction Act\u2014\u201cthe beginning of a levy or pro-\nceeding during\u201d that period of suspension \u201cmay be en-\njoined by a proceeding in the proper court, including the \nTax Court\u201d if an appeal to the Tax Court is timely filed.  \nIbid.  But the timely appeal triggers Tax Court jurisdic-\ntion to enjoin other actions \u201conly in respect of the un-\npaid tax or proposed levy to which the determination \nbeing appealed relates.\u201d  Ibid.  And that power ceases \nto matter when the IRS has already decided not to pur-\n\n21 \n \nsue the proposed levy because it is satisfied that the tax \nhas been paid. \nThus, when the IRS determines that it no longer \nneeds or intends to take the taxpayer\u2019s property by \nlevy, the pre-levy proceeding becomes moot.  That is \ntrue whether the liability has been \u201cabated,\u201d see Will-\nson, 805 F.3d at 320 (IRS ceased pursuing levy based on \nincorrect assessment); Byers v. Commissioner, 740 \nF.3d 668, 679 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (similar); or has been sat-\nisfied with other taxpayer funds, see McLane, 24 F.4th \nat 319; Greene-Thapedi, 126 T.C. at 7.   \nAnd the proceeding remains moot regardless of \nwhether the taxpayer contends that the IRS has made \nan error or continues to owe her money.  See Willson, \n805 F.3d at 320; McLane, 24 F.4th at 319 n.*; Greene-\nThapedi, 126 T.C. at 7.  The taxpayer may make those \narguments in a post-deprivation suit for a refund\u2014the \ntraditional mechanism for disputing the assessment or \ncollection of a federal tax.  See 26 U.S.C. 7422(a); 28 \nU.S.C. 1346(a)(1), 1491(a)(1).  But the Section 6330 pro-\nceeding is a rare pre-deprivation mechanism for chal-\nlenging a particular method of a collection: a proposed \nlevy.  Once the IRS no longer seeks to deprive the tax-\npayer of any property by levy, the issue that prompted \nthe Section 6330 proceeding is no longer \u201c\u200a\u2018live,\u2019\u200a\u201d and the \nparties have ceased to have any \u201clegally cognizable in-\nterest\u201d in a determination regarding the permissibility \nof the levy.  Chafin v. Chafin, 568 U.S. 165, 172 (2013) \n(citation omitted).2   \n \n2 Although it is not organized under Article III, the Tax Court has \nconcluded that \u201c[t]he case or controversy requirement under Article \nIII \u2018presumptively\u2019 applies in the Tax Court.\u201d  Pet. App. 15a (quot-\ning Battat v. Commissioner, 148 T.C. 32, 46 (2017)).  This Court \nneed not determine whether the Tax Court\u2019s understanding is cor-\n\n22 \n \nB. Section 6330\u2019s History And Function Within The Inter-\nnal Revenue Code Confirm That A Pre-levy Proceeding \nBecomes Moot When There Is No Longer A Live Dispute \nOver A Proposed Levy  \n1. As discussed above, the default means for a tax-\npayer to dispute the assessment or collection of a federal \ntax is a post-payment refund suit.  See pp. 3-4, supra.  Be-\nfore 1998, the Internal Revenue Code authorized the \nIRS to levy upon taxpayer property without any prior \nopportunity for a hearing or other pre-collection pro-\ncess, so long as the taxpayer was given 30 days\u2019 notice.  \nSee 26 U.S.C. 6331(d) (1994); see, e.g., Iames v. Com-\nmissioner, 850 F.3d 160, 165 (4th Cir. 2017) (describing \n\u201cthe Commissioner\u2019s significant and previously unfet-\ntered power to levy\u201d).   \nThat changed in 1998, when Congress enacted \u201ca \nprocedural protection for taxpayers to oppose IRS col-\nlection actions\u201d before they occurred.  Jeffers v. Com-\nmissioner, 992 F.3d 649, 655 (7th Cir. 2021).  In making \nthat change, Congress\u2019s \u201cgeneral focus\u201d was \u201con the \nCommissioner\u2019s collection of a predetermined liability.\u201d  \n \nrect.  Regardless of whether Article III constraints apply, \u201cthe con-\ntroversy must also fall within the [Tax Court\u2019s] statutory grant of \njurisdiction.\u201d  Willson, 805 F.3d at 320.  And once the IRS has de-\ntermined that it will not pursue a levy, the Tax Court lacks statutory \njurisdiction over a Section 6330 proceeding.  This Court may resolve \nthe question presented on that basis.  See Sinochem Int\u2019l Co. v. Ma-\nlaysia Int\u2019l Shipping Corp., 549 U.S. 422, 430-431 (2007).    \n In any event, assuming that Article III principles do apply, the \ncase is moot.  Respondent has no live interest in contesting a with-\ndrawn levy, and the only relief that the Tax Court could provide\u2014a \ndetermination that the levy could not go forward, and an injunction \nagainst it\u2014would not constitute \u201ceffectual relief,\u201d Campbell-Ewald \nCo. v. Gomez, 577 U.S. 153, 161 (2016) (citation omitted), after the \nproposed levy has already been withdrawn.   \n\n23 \n \nIames, 850 F.3d at 165.  That is, Congress designed Sec-\ntion 6330 to review a proposed levy, not to provide a \nmore general opportunity for a taxpayer to challenge an \nassessment of tax. \nThe pre-levy procedures in Section 6330 were under-\nstood as \u201cestablish[ing] formal procedures designed to \ninsure due process where the IRS seeks to collect taxes \nby levy.\u201d  S. Rep. No. 174, 105th Cong., 2d Sess. 67 (1998); \nsee ibid. (\u201c[T]he Committee believes that the IRS \nshould afford taxpayers adequate notice of collection ac-\ntivity and a meaningful hearing before the IRS deprives \nthem of their property.\u201d); see also H.R. Rep. No. 599, \n105th Cong., 2d Sess. 263 (1998) (describing the new \nprovision in similar terms).  \u201c[T]he entire purpose be-\nhind the creation of [Section 6330] was to provide tax-\npayers with greater due process to contest the IRS\u2019s \nlevy and sale of their property.\u201d  Zapara v. Commis-\nsioner, 652 F.3d 1042, 1045 (9th Cir. 2011).  Nothing in \nthe history of the provision suggests that Congress in-\ntended for the pre-levy proceeding to continue where \nthere is no longer a live dispute over a proposed levy. \n2. That understanding of Section 6330 is consistent \nwith its important but limited function within the Inter-\nnal Revenue Code.  Challenges to the assessment of a \ntax are generally the province of post-payment refund \nsuits, and in the case of certain taxes, pre-payment de-\nficiency actions.  See pp. 3-4, supra.  The Internal Rev-\nenue Code and other statutes protect that principle \nthrough provisions like the Tax Anti-Injunction Act, 26 \nU.S.C. 7421(a), and the tax exception to the Declaratory \nJudgment Act, 28 U.S.C. 2201(a), which generally pre-\nclude suits for injunctive and declaratory relief regard-\ning the assessment or collection of taxes.  Understood \nagainst that backdrop, Section 6330 is a limited mecha-\n\n24 \n \nnism to ensure that a taxpayer may \u201cchallenge a levy \nbefore seizure and sale,\u201d Pet. App. 4a\u2014not an addi-\ntional avenue to seek relief in the absence of a live dis-\npute over a levy.   \nThere are tens of thousands of Section 6330 proceed-\nings each year.  See Treasury Inspector Gen. for Tax \nAdmin., U.S. Dep\u2019t of the Treasury, Report No. 2023-\n10-038, Review of the IRS Independent Office of Ap-\npeals Collection Due Process Program 7 (July 2023), \nperma.cc/DVL7-9HA8 (reporting 28,349 closed Section \n6330 cases in 2023).  Allowing those proceedings to con-\ntinue even when the IRS no longer seeks to levy on a \ntaxpayer\u2019s property could convert many of them from a \nlimited opportunity for pre-deprivation review into a \nmore general forum for considering challenges to tax li-\nability.  Nothing in the text or history of Section 6330 \nsupports that end-run around the calibrated statutory \nframework that generally provides for post-payment \nadjudication of disputes over tax liability. \nC. The Contrary Arguments Offered By Respondent And \nThe Court Of Appeals Lack Merit \nThe court of appeals recognized that \u201cthe Tax Court \nneed not hear a moot case.\u201d  Pet. App. 16a.  But the \ncourt held that a pre-levy proceeding under Section \n6330 does not become moot when the IRS \u201cwithdr[aws] \nits levy.\u201d  Id. at 25a.  That was error, and neither the \ncourt of appeals nor respondent has offered any persua-\nsive support for the court\u2019s holding. \n1. The Tax Court lacks jurisdiction to consider a tax-\npayer\u2019s \u201cunderlying tax liability\u201d when there is no \nlive dispute over a proposed levy \na. In a portion of its opinion joined by only two mem-\nbers of the panel, the court of appeals held that the Sec-\n\n25 \n \ntion 6330 proceeding in this case is not moot because re-\nspondent still disputes whether the IRS \u201cerroneously \nallocated\u201d the estimated payments to Gennardo rather \nthan respondent.  Pet. App. 19a.  The court relied on \nSection 6330(c)(2)(B), which, in certain circumstances, \nallows a taxpayer to raise at a Section 6330 hearing \u201cthe \nexistence or amount of the underlying tax liability.\u201d  26 \nU.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B).  Respondent likewise contends \n(Br. in Opp. 14) that the Tax Court may \u201cresolve any \ndispute about the taxpayer\u2019s underlying tax liability \nthat the taxpayer properly raised before the Appeals \nOffice\u201d\u2014even if the IRS no longer seeks to enforce the \nlevy that gave rise to the Section 6330 proceeding.3 \nThat argument ignores the text and context of Sec-\ntion 6330(c)(2)(B).  That provision comes into play \n \n3 The parties have disagreed about which subsection of Section \n6330 governs respondent\u2019s challenge to the IRS\u2019s allocation of  \nestimated payments.  See Pet. Reply Br. 4 n.2.  While respondent \nrelies on Section 6330(c)(2)(B)\u2019s reference to \u201cchallenges to the ex-\nistence or amount of the underlying tax liability,\u201d id. at 4, the gov-\nernment disputes that characterization because the liability  \nitself\u2014respondent\u2019s self-reported 2010 tax\u2014is not in question.  \nSee Gov\u2019t C.A. Supp. Br. 24-25.  Because respondent claims that the \nagreed-upon liability should have been paid through the estimated \npayments, the government views that argument as an \u201cissue relat-\ning to the unpaid tax.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(A); see Melasky v. Com-\nmissioner, 151 T.C. 89, 92 (2018) (\u201cA question about whether the \nIRS properly credited a payment is not a challenge to a tax liability; \ni.e., the amount of tax imposed by the Code for a particular year.  It \nis instead a question of whether the liability remains unpaid.\u201d).  The \nCourt need not, however, decide this dispute to resolve the question \npresented.  As discussed in the text, even under respondent\u2019s char-\nacterization, the Section 6330 proceeding in this case is moot be-\ncause a taxpayer may challenge her \u201cunderlying tax liability\u201d only \nin connection with a determination whether a proposed levy may \nproceed. \n\n26 \n \nwhere the taxpayer seeks to dispute an \u201cunderlying tax \nliability.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B).  For a \u201cliability\u201d to \nexist, the taxpayer must still owe a debt to the IRS.  See \nWebster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary of the \nEnglish Language 1302 (1993) (Webster\u2019s Third) (defin-\ning \u201cliability\u201d as \u201can amount that is owed whether pay-\nable in money, other property, or services\u201d); see also \nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary 1095 (12th ed. 2024) (defining \n\u201cliability\u201d as \u201c[a] financial or pecuniary obligation in a \nspecificed amount; DEBT <tax liability>\u201d).   \nCrucially, for a taxpayer\u2019s liability to be \u201cunderly-\ning,\u201d it must be \u201clying under or beneath,\u201d \u201cbe at the ba-\nsis of,\u201d or \u201cform the foundation of\u200a\u201d something else.  \nWebster\u2019s Third 2489 (definitions of \u201cunderlying\u201d and \n\u201cunderlie\u201d).  In the context of Section 6330, the tax lia-\nbility is \u201cunderlying\u201d the proposed \u201clevy actions which \nare the subject of the requested hearing.\u201d  26 U.S.C. \n6330(c)(2)(B) and (e)(1).  When there is not a proposed \nlevy, any dispute about tax liability ceases to be the \nfoundation for something else.  There is accordingly no \n\u201cunderlying tax liability\u201d for purposes of 26 U.S.C. \n6330(c)(2)(B). \nAs the Fourth Circuit has correctly explained, the \nphrase \u201cunderlying tax liability\u201d must be understood in \n\u201cthe specific context in which that language is used,\u201d \nand in Section 6330, \u201cthe \u2018specific context\u2019 is the IRS\u2019s \nattempt to collect via lien or levy.\u201d  McLane, 24 F.4th at \n319 (quoting Yates v. United States, 574 U.S. 528, 537 \n(2015)).  Where Section 6330(c)(2)(B) applies, a tax-\npayer may challenge the existence or amount of her \n\u201cunderlying tax liability,\u201d 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B)\u2014just \nas she may raise \u201cany relevant issue relating to the un-\npaid tax,\u201d 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(A).  But those challenges \nare available for purposes of informing the determina-\n\n27 \n \ntion whether the proposed levy may proceed.  The stat-\nute therefore requires the Appeals Office to \u201ctake\u201d \nthose factors \u201cinto consideration\u201d in making its \u201cdeter-\nmination\u201d about the levy.  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3).  And the \nTax Court will in turn review \u201csuch determination\u201d on \nappeal.  26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1).  If the Tax Court con-\ncludes that a taxpayer owes less than the IRS has cal-\nculated, that conclusion will affect the propriety of the \nproposed collection action because the IRS cannot col-\nlect more than is owed.    \nBut that is the extent of the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction \nunder Section 6330.  Section 6330 does not identify a \nchallenge to the taxpayer\u2019s \u201cunderlying tax liability\u201d as \na freestanding issue.  When the IRS is not seeking a levy, \nthere is no underlying liability, and Section 6330(c)(2)(B) \nhas no role to play.  In that instance, the taxpayer can-\nnot use a Section 6330 proceeding as an \u201cindependent \nbasis to challenge the existence or amount\u201d of her tax \ndebt, Greene-Thapedi, 126 T.C. at 8\u2014just as she could \nnot have used Section 6330 to seek such findings if no \nlevy had been proposed in the first place.  See McLane, \n24 F.4th at 319; Willson, 805 F.3d at 320-321; Byers, 740 \nF.3d at 679.   \nb. Echoing the court of appeals (Pet. App. 33a-36a), \nrespondent has suggested (Br. in Opp. 19) that her case \nis not moot because the Tax Court \u201chad authority to is-\nsue declaratory relief as to [her] underlying liability.\u201d  \nBut even where declaratory relief is generally available, \nit \u201cdoes not \u2018extend\u2019 the \u2018jurisdiction\u2019 of the federal \ncourts.\u201d  Medtronic, Inc. v. Mirowski Family Ventures, \nLLC, 571 U.S. 191, 197 (2014) (quoting Skelly Oil Co. v. \nPhillips Petroleum Co., 339 U.S. 667, 671 (1950)).  And \nhere, the Tax Court lacks the authority to provide the \ndeclaration that respondent seeks. \n\n28 \n \nCongress has granted only limited powers of declar-\natory relief with respect to federal taxes.  The Declara-\ntory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. 2201(a), bars declaratory \njudgments \u201cwith respect to Federal taxes other than ac-\ntions brought under section 7428 of the Internal Reve-\nnue Code of 1986.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2201(a); see ibid. (excluding \ncertain bankruptcy and duty-related proceedings).  Sec-\ntion 7428 grants authority to issue declaratory judgments, \nbut only with respect to tax-exempt status.  26 U.S.C. \n7428(a)(1) and (2).  Congress has also authorized the Tax \nCourt to issue declaratory relief in certain other con-\ntexts.  See 26 U.S.C. 7476-7479.  But none of those pro-\nvisions authorizes the Tax Court to issue declaratory \njudgments in a levy-review proceeding under Section \n6330.   \nRespondent contends (Br. in Opp. 23) that because \nSection 6330(e)(1) \u201cauthorizes\u201d the Tax Court to order \n\u201cinjunctive relief,\u201d it \u201cnecessarily * * *  authorizes de-\nclaratory relief\u200a\u201d as well.  See Pet. App. 35a-36a.  But \nrespondent\u2019s reasoning fails on its own terms.  Where \nthe IRS no longer seeks to enforce a levy, the court has \nno power to enjoin a levy under Section 6330(e).  See, \ne.g., Willson, 805 F.3d at 321.  Respondent therefore \ncannot bootstrap from the Tax Court\u2019s authority to is-\nsue an injunction the \u201cmilder\u201d authority to issue a de-\nclaratory judgment.  Br. in Opp. 23 (quoting Steffel v. \nThompson, 415 U.S. 452, 466-467 (1974)). \nMore generally, Section 6330(e)(1)\u2019s limited grant of \nauthority to enjoin a specific collection action during a \nlevy-review proceeding does not provide for Tax Court \njurisdiction over any administrative action other than \nthe proposed levy that is \u201cthe subject of the requested \nhearing.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(1).  That provision simply \nprovides courts with an enforcement mechanism to pre-\n\n29 \n \nvent the use of a particular administrative collection \ntool\u2014an administrative levy to collect a specific under-\nlying liability\u2014while the taxpayer is provided the op-\nportunity to mount a pre-deprivation challenge to that \nlevy.  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(A) and (e). \nReading the exception in Section 6330(e) to open the \ndoor to more general declaratory and injunctive relief \nwould be at odds with Congress\u2019s determination, as a \ngeneral rule, to \u201cpermit the United States to assess and \ncollect taxes alleged to be due without judicial interven-\ntion, and to require that the legal right to the disputed \nsums be determined in a suit for refund.\u201d  Enochs v. \nWilliams Packing & Navigation Co., 370 U.S. 1, 7 \n(1962) (citing 26 U.S.C. 7421(a)); see, e.g., Phillips v. \nCommissioner, 283 U.S. 589, 595-597 (1931).  Congress\u2019s \ndecision to suspend certain collection procedures while \nlevy-review proceedings are pending\u2014and to authorize \nthe Tax Court to enforce that suspension\u2014did not cre-\nate additional exceptions to the general rule.4 \nc. Respondent suggests that the Tax Court\u2019s limited \npre-deprivation jurisdiction survives the IRS\u2019s aban-\n \n4 The court of appeals declined to decide whether the Tax Court \nhas \u201coverpayment or refund jurisdiction in a context like this,\u201d Pet. \nApp. 34a n.38, and respondent has not raised that issue in this Court, \nsee Br. in Opp. 21.  There is no general grant of refund jurisdiction \nin the Tax Court.  See, e.g., United States ex rel. Girard Trust Co. \nv. Helvering, 301 U.S. 540, 542 (1937) (addressing the Tax Court\u2019s \npredecessor); Empire Ordinance Corp. v. Harrington, 249 F.2d \n680, 682 (D.C. Cir. 1957).  And while Congress has given the Tax \nCourt jurisdiction to determine an overpayment or refund in certain \nspecific proceedings, see 26 U.S.C. 6015(e) and (g), 6213, 6214(a), \n6404(h), 6512(b), it has not done so with respect to pre-levy chal-\nlenges under Section 6330, see, e.g., Brown v. Commissioner, 58 \nF.4th 1064, 1066-1067 (9th Cir. 2023); McLane, 24 F.4th at 319; Will-\nson, 805 F.3d at 321; Greene-Thapedi, 126 T.C. at 8, 12-13. \n\n30 \n \ndonment of its proposed levy because, in other contexts, \n\u201cjurisdiction \u2018depend[s] upon the state of things at the \ntime of the action brought.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Br. in Opp. 16 (quoting \nGrupo Dataflux v. Atlas Global Grp., L.P., 541 U.S. 567, \n570 (2004)).  But as the cases that respondent cites make \nclear, \u201cthat principle is not absolute.\u201d  Coba v. Ford Mo-\ntor Co., 932 F.3d 114, 119 (3d Cir. 2019).  Most \u201cnotably, \nwhere a case becomes moot in the course of the litiga-\ntion,\u201d a court cannot continue to adjudicate it.  Cun-\nningham Charter Corp. v. LearJet, Inc., 592 F.3d 805, \n810 (7th Cir. 2010).  That is the case here:  Section 6330 \nprovides the Tax Court with jurisdiction to review a \n\u201cdetermination\u201d whether a proposed levy may proceed.  \n26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3) and (d)(1).  When there is no longer \nany need for such a determination, there is no need for \nreview of such a determination, and the Section 6330 \nproceeding is moot. \nEven outside of mootness scenarios, this Court has \nrecognized that a court may be deprived of subject- \nmatter jurisdiction by developments that fundamen-\ntally alter the basis for a lawsuit, such as \u201cthe with-\ndrawal of [the original] allegations\u201d on which jurisdic-\ntion was based.  Rockwell Int\u2019l Corp. v. United States, \n549 U.S. 457, 473 (2007).  The Court recently applied \nthat principle in Royal Canin U.S.A., Inc. v. Wull-\nschleger, 604 U.S. 22 (2025).  There, the plaintiff filed a \ncomplaint in state court containing both federal- and \nstate-law claims, and the defendant removed the case to \nfederal court, invoking federal-question jurisdiction \n(over the federal-law claims) and supplemental jurisdic-\ntion (over the state-law claims).  Id. at 28-29.  After the \nremoval, the plaintiff amended her complaint to remove \nthe federal claims.  Id. at 29.  This Court recognized \nthat, at that point, the \u201cchanges in claims\u201d had \u201ceffec-\n\n31 \n \ntively rema[d]e the suit.\u201d   Id. at 35.  Because there were \nno longer any federal-law claims to which the consider-\nation of state-law claims could be considered supple-\nmental, the district court had ceased to have any \u201csup-\nplemental jurisdiction at all.\u201d  Id. at 34. \nThe same logic applies here.  The fundamental basis \nfor a Section 6330 proceeding is the taxpayer\u2019s claim \nthat the IRS should not be allowed to collect a tax lia-\nbility via levy.  See C.A. App. 24 (respondent\u2019s petition \nfor review in the Tax Court sought review of the \u201cdeter-\nmination  * * *  reflected in [the] Notice of Determina-\ntion Concerning Collection Action[s]\u201d in her case, which \n\u201csustained the validity and appropriateness of a Final \nNotice of Intent to Levy\u201d).  Respondent\u2019s overpayments \nof taxes in subsequent years\u2014and the IRS\u2019s resulting \ndetermination that it \u201cno longer needs nor intends to \ncollect [respondent\u2019s] income tax liability\u201d via levy, C.A. \nDoc. 5-4, at 450\u2014effectively remade the suit, eliminat-\ning the need to determine whether the levy could pro-\nceed and hence any need to decide the underlying tax \nliability.  The Tax Court accordingly ceased to have ju-\nrisdiction under Section 6330.   \n2. The Tax Court has no \u201cimplicit\u201d jurisdiction to  \nreview offsets in a Section 6330 proceeding  \nThe court of appeals alternatively held that this case \nis not moot because the Tax Court could review the \nIRS\u2019s allocation of respondent\u2019s later-year overpay-\nments to offset her 2010 tax liability.  Pet. App. 20a-25a.  \nIn so holding, the court of appeals reasoned that, while \n\u201cit may be that Congress has not explicitly granted the \nTax Court such power,\u201d there is nevertheless \u201can im-\nplicit grant\u201d of jurisdiction that \u201callows the [Tax] Court \nto review setoffs in any event.\u201d  Id. at 20a. \n\n32 \n \nRespondent did not defend that aspect of the court \nof appeals\u2019 decision in her brief in opposition.  And for \ngood reason.  Tax Court jurisdiction must be expressly \nconferred by statute.  See p. 16, supra; 26 U.S.C. 7442 \n(\u201cThe Tax Court and its divisions shall have such juris-\ndiction as is conferred on them by this title, by chapters \n1, 2, 3, and 4 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, by \ntitle II and title III of the Revenue Act of 1926 (44 Stat. \n10\u201387), or by laws enacted subsequent to February 26, \n1926.\u201d).  And no statute grants the Tax Court jurisdic-\ntion to review in a Section 6330 proceeding the IRS\u2019s \nexercise of authority under Section 6402(a) to credit (or \noffset) a taxpayer\u2019s overpayments against her tax liabil-\nity.  To the contrary, Section 6330 grants the Tax Court \njurisdiction only to review\u2014and, if necessary, enjoin\u2014\nthe \u201clevy action[]\u201d that is the \u201csubject of the requested \nhearing.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(1).  It does not affect the \nIRS\u2019s ability to take other enforcement actions, includ-\ning the authority to credit overpayments against exist-\ning liabilities under Section 6402; nor does it grant the \nTax Court jurisdiction to review such actions.  See 26 \nC.F.R. 301.6330\u20131(g)(2), Q & A-G3; see also Belloff v. \nCommissioner, 996 F.2d 607, 616 (2d Cir. 1993).  Courts \nhave therefore repeatedly held that the Tax Court lacks \njurisdiction to review Section 6402(a) credits in a Sec-\ntion 6330 proceeding.  See, e.g., Boyd v. Commissioner, \n451 F.3d 8, 10-11 (1st Cir. 2006); Greene-Thapedi, 126 \nT.C. at 7-8.   \nMoreover, even if the Tax Court had jurisdiction to \nreview the application of credits under Section 6402 in \na Section 6330 proceeding, the court of appeals\u2019 moot-\nness holding would still be erroneous.  The court of ap-\npeals reasoned that the Tax Court has jurisdiction to \nreview the IRS\u2019s use of respondent\u2019s overpayments to \n\n33 \n \noffset her tax liability, and that those offsets were inva-\nlid, such that respondent should be deemed to have an \noutstanding tax liability for 2010.  Pet. App. 20a-25a.  \nAnd the court of appeals took the view that the Tax \nCourt therefore has jurisdiction to consider respond-\nent\u2019s challenge to \u201cthe IRS\u2019s application of the esti-\nmated payments\u201d to Gennardo rather than respondent.  \nPet. App. 19a.  But the Tax Court would have jurisdic-\ntion under Section 6330 to consider such a challenge \nonly in connection with a live dispute over a proposed \nlevy.  See pp. 16-31, supra.  And the IRS has no basis \nfor pursuing a levy so long as respondent\u2019s overpay-\nments remain \u201cin the government\u2019s pocket.\u201d  Pet. App. \n25a.  Nor did the court of appeals conclude that the Tax \nCourt could order the IRS to refund those overpay-\nments.  See p. 29 n.4, supra.  Thus, even if the applica-\ntion of credits was invalid\u2014and it was not5\u2014the Section \n6330 proceeding would still be moot at this point.  \nD. The Instant Case Is Moot \nApplying the foregoing principles, respondent\u2019s case \nis moot.  In 2012, respondent self-reported to the IRS \nthat she owed $21,918 in taxes for tax year 2010.  C.A. \nApp. 475.  The IRS assessed liability based on respond-\nent\u2019s representation.  Id. at 280; see 26 U.S.C. 6201(a)(1).  \nWhen the IRS then proposed to collect the liability by \n \n5 The court of appeals concluded that the application of credits vi-\nolated the common-law rule that \u201ca creditor cannot set off a disputed \ndebt with an undisputed one.\u201d  Pet. App. 22a.  But that rule has no \napplication under Section 6402(a), which authorizes the IRS to \n\u201ccredit the amount of [an] overpayment  * * *  against any liability,\u201d \nundisputed or not.  26 U.S.C. 6402(a).  The court also reasoned that \nthe application of credits violated \u201cArticle III mootness principles.\u201d  \nPet. App. 25a.  But no such principles limit the IRS\u2019s exercise of \nstatutory authority under Section 6402(a). \n\n34 \n \nadministrative levy, respondent timely requested a pre-\ndeprivation hearing under Section 6330 to argue that \ncertain estimated tax payments should be applied to her \naccount, which would have (more than) satisfied her re-\nported tax liability, such that the proposed levy could \nnot go forward.  C.A. App. 566.   \nDuring the pendency of her pre-levy proceedings, re-\nspondent made overpayments for subsequent tax years, \nand, under Section 6402(a), the IRS credited those new \npayments against respondent\u2019s 2010 liability.  With no \nunpaid tax remaining on respondent\u2019s underlying liabil-\nity, there is no basis to proceed with the levy that re-\nspondent had challenged.  In these circumstances, there \nis no live dispute subject to Section 6330, and the Tax \nCourt can grant no further relief in a Section 6330 pro-\nceeding.  The case is therefore moot.   \nContrary to respondent\u2019s suggestion, that result \ndoes not violate \u201cthe presumption favoring judicial re-\nview of administrative action.\u201d  Br. in Opp. 23 (citation \nomitted).  As respondent has acknowledged (id. at 2, 4, \n13, 16, 25), a holding that her Section 6330 proceeding \nis moot will not foreclose her from seeking judicial re-\nview because she could file a refund suit\u2014the tradi-\ntional mechanism for disputing the assessment or col-\nlection of a federal tax, and the one that is available re-\ngardless of whether the IRS had ever proposed to levy \non respondent\u2019s property.  See 26 U.S.C. 7422(a); 28 \nU.S.C. 1346(a)(1); see also 26 U.S.C. 7422(d) (deeming \noverpayment credits to be \u201cpayment[s]\u201d for purposes of \na refund suit).  This Court should hew to Section 6330\u2019s \nplain text, which limits the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to a \ndispute over a proposed levy. \n\n35 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThis Court should reverse the judgment of the court \nof appeals. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nSARAH M.

So far, the analysis has likely focused on the petitioner's (the government's) arguments. To make an informed prediction, it is absolutely essential to understand the respondent's counterarguments in full detail. The respondent's brief will contain the core legal and policy arguments for affirming the Third Circuit's decision, including detailed statutory interpretation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6330, responses to the government's mootness claims, and arguments about why the IRS should not be able to unilaterally defeat Tax Court jurisdiction. This information is fundamental to understanding the full scope of the legal dispute and how different Justices might weigh the competing interests. Therefore, the Task EIG is very high, as this document is a primary source containing the other half of the core legal debate. The Design EIG is also significant because it reinforces a crucial, non-negotiable step in any SCOTUS prediction workflow: systematically gathering and analyzing the primary briefs from both parties before forming a conclusion.

See I.R.C. \u00a7 6330. At the hearing, the \ntaxpayer may raise \u201cany relevant issue relating to the \nunpaid \ntax \nor \nthe \nproposed \nlevy.\u201d \nI.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A). The taxpayer may also challenge her \nunderlying tax liability if she did not previously have \nan opportunity to do so. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B). The Ap-\npeals Office issues a \u201cdetermination,\u201d which \u201cshall \ntake into consideration\u201d \u201cthe issues raised under par-\nagraph (2),\u201d including any challenge relating to the \nunpaid tax or the taxpayer\u2019s liability. I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(c)(3). After the Appeals Office renders its de-\ntermination, the taxpayer may \u201cpetition the Tax Court \nfor review of such determination,\u201d \u201cand the Tax Court \nshall have jurisdiction with respect to such matter.\u201d \nI.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). \nThe question presented is whether the Tax Court \nretains jurisdiction under I.R.C. \u00a7 6330 to review the \nAppeals Office\u2019s determination of the taxpayer\u2019s un-\npaid tax or underlying liability when, despite the \nparties\u2019 live dispute about that issue, the IRS stops \npursuing the levy, because it instead keeps the tax-\npayer\u2019s overpayments for later tax years. \n \n \n\nii \n \n \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDINGS AND \nRELATED PROCEEDINGS \nPetitioner\u2019s lists of the parties to the proceeding \nand directly related proceedings are complete and cor-\nrect. \n\niii \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \nQUESTION PRESENTED ........................................... i \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDINGS AND \nRELATED PROCEEDINGS ................................ ii \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES ....................................... vi \nINTRODUCTION ........................................................ 1 \nSTATEMENT .............................................................. 6 \nA. Legal background ........................................... 6 \nB. Factual and procedural background ............ 10 \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT ................................... 16 \nARGUMENT.............................................................. 21 \nI. \nThe Tax Court had jurisdiction under I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330 to review and rule on Zuch\u2019s unpaid \ntax or tax liability, so the case isn\u2019t moot. ......... 21 \nA. The Tax Court had jurisdiction to \nreview the Appeals Office\u2019s \ndetermination of Zuch\u2019s entitlement to \nthe estimated payments. .............................. 21 \n1. Section 6330\u2019s plain text states that \nthe Tax Court has jurisdiction to \nreview the Appeals Office\u2019s \n\u201cdetermination\u201d of a taxpayer\u2019s \nchallenge to \u201cany relevant issue \nrelating to [her] unpaid tax\u201d or her \n\u201cunderlying liability.\u201d ............................. 21 \n2. Statutory context confirms that \nCongress gave the Tax Court \ncontinuing jurisdiction to resolve \nissues relating to the unpaid tax \nand tax liability disputes. ...................... 24 \n\niv \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \n(continued) \nPage \n \n \n3. The Tax Court had jurisdiction \nunder \u00a7 6330 to review the Appeals \nOffice\u2019s determination, including its \nresolution of Zuch\u2019s entitlement to \nthe estimated payments......................... 26 \nB. Zuch\u2019s case did not become moot when \nthe IRS decided to stop pursuing the \nlevy, because the parties disputed, and \nthe Tax Court had the power to \nadjudicate, Zuch\u2019s entitlement to the \nestimated payments. .................................... 27 \n1. A case becomes moot only when the \nparties no longer have a concrete \ninterest in the outcome of the \nlitigation and judicial relief is not \nlikely to redress any injury. ................... 28 \n2. Zuch\u2019s challenge isn\u2019t moot because \na favorable Tax Court ruling on \nunderlying liability or unpaid tax \nwould likely redress her pocketbook \ninjury. ..................................................... 28 \nII. The IRS\u2019s counterarguments lack merit. ........... 31 \nA. The Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to review \nwhether Zuch was entitled to the \nprepayments didn\u2019t dissolve once the \nIRS no longer needed the levy. .................... 31 \n1. There is no textual basis in \u00a7 6330 \nfor the government\u2019s continuing-\nlevy requirement. ................................... 32 \n\nv \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \n(continued) \nPage \n \n \n2. The government misconstrues \n\u00a7 6330\u2019s history and downplays its \nremedial purpose, which both \nsupport the Tax Court\u2019s \u00a7 6330 \njurisdiction to review unpaid tax \nand liability disputes even if the \nIRS no longer pursues the levy. ............. 36 \n3. Royal Canin doesn\u2019t help the \ngovernment. ............................................ 37 \n4. The government\u2019s policy argument \nis meritless. ............................................ 39 \nB. The Tax Court\u2019s authority is not limited \nto approving or rejecting a proposed \nlevy, but includes the power to issue \nbinding judgments. ....................................... 40 \nC. The government\u2019s claim that the parties \nlack a legally cognizable interest in the \ncase once the IRS decides not to move \nforward with the levy is incorrect. ............... 42 \nD.

The answer is yes. The Tax Court has juris-\ndiction under Internal Revenue Code \u00a7 6330(d)(1) to \nreview the Appeals Office\u2019s determination and the \nmatters and issues that determination resolves, and \nnothing in \u00a7 6330 conditions that jurisdiction on the \nIRS\u2019s continuing pursuit of a levy. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1); \nsee I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c). The Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to re-\nview the Appeals Office\u2019s determination thus gives the \ncourt authority to rule on the taxpayer\u2019s unpaid tax or \nunderlying liability. And because the government is \nexpected to abide by judicial rulings, those rulings \nwould redress Zuch\u2019s pocketbook injury. This case is \nnot moot. \nJennifer Zuch owed about $27,000 for the 2010 tax \nyear. But she and her ex-husband had already made \n$50,000 in estimated payments to the IRS for the 2010 \ntax year, and Zuch asked the IRS to apply those pay-\nments to her tax bill. Zuch\u2019s ex-husband agreed that \nthose tax payments should be applied to Zuch\u2019s tax \nbill. But the IRS refused. Instead, it applied the full \n$50,000 in estimated payments to Zuch\u2019s ex-husband\u2019s \nbalance. It then threatened to seize Zuch\u2019s property to \ncollect her 2010 tax assessment. \nZuch exercised her right to a hearing under \n\u00a7 6330, which provides taxpayers with procedural pro-\ntections before the IRS may levy their property to \ncollect taxes. Congress enacted \u00a7 6330 as part of the \nInternal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform \n\n2 \n \n \nAct in response to abusive IRS collections practices \nthat forced some taxpayers to spend their life\u2019s sav-\nings on taxes the IRS or courts later determined they \nnever even owed. Practices & Procedures of the Inter-\nnal Revenue Service: Hearings Before the Committee \non Finance, 105th Cong., S. Hrg. 105-190 at 75-82 \n(1997) [hereinafter Hearings Before the Committee on \nFinance] (statement of Katherine Lund Hicks). Sec-\ntion 6330 ensures that taxpayers can dispute their tax \nbill before having to pay. The provision allows taxpay-\ners threatened with a levy to initiate administrative \nhearings before the Appeals Office and to raise \u201cany \nrelevant issue relating to the unpaid tax\u201d or challenge \ntheir liability if they haven\u2019t yet had a chance to do so. \nI.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2). Section 6330 also grants taxpayers \nan opportunity for meaningful judicial review by \ngranting the Tax Court jurisdiction to review the Ap-\npeals Office\u2019s determination. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). \nAt her administrative hearing, Zuch argued that \nthe IRS should have credited her with the $50,000 in \nestimated payments that she and her ex-husband had \nmade. Those payments would have covered her 2010 \ntax bill and entitled her to a refund. The Appeals Of-\nfice disagreed, concluding that Zuch was not entitled \nto any portion of the estimated payments and uphold-\ning the proposed levy. Zuch petitioned the Tax Court \nfor review of the Appeals Office\u2019s determination. But \nduring the course of the Tax Court proceedings, the \nIRS kept overpayments that Zuch made for later tax \nyears and used them to offset her disputed 2010 lia-\nbility. By 2019, after six years of litigation, the IRS \nclaimed that Zuch had satisfied the disputed liability, \nand it moved to dismiss the Tax Court proceedings as \nmoot. \n\n3 \n \n \nThe Tax Court agreed and dismissed the petition. \nAccording to the court, because there was no unpaid \nliability and no levy, the case was moot. Pet. App. 43a. \nThe court of appeals vacated and remanded. In a \npart of the opinion joined by two panel members, the \ncourt held that the case was not moot because the Tax \nCourt had jurisdiction to review the Appeals Office\u2019s \ndetermination of and declare Zuch\u2019s liability. Pet. \nApp. 25a-26a; see Pet. App. 25a-38a. And a declara-\ntory judgment, the court concluded, would redress \nZuch\u2019s injury. Pet. App. 37a-38a. \nThe court of appeals correctly recognized that the \nTax Court had jurisdiction to review the Appeals Of-\nfice\u2019s determination and that this case is not moot. \nThis Court should affirm. \n1. a. The Tax Court had, and retained, jurisdic-\ntion to review the Appeals Office\u2019s determination. \nSection 6330\u2019s plain text states that the Tax Court \n\u201cshall have jurisdiction\u201d to \u201creview\u201d the Appeals Of-\nfice\u2019s \u201cdetermination,\u201d including its resolution of \u201cany \nrelevant issue relating to the unpaid tax,\u201d or the tax-\npayer\u2019s \u201cunderlying tax liability.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2), \n(c)(3), (d)(1). Nothing in that language, or anything \nelse in \u00a7 6330, requires an ongoing attempt to levy the \ntaxpayer\u2019s property. Thus, the Tax Court retains ju-\nrisdiction \nto \nreview \nthe \nAppeals \nOffice\u2019s \ndetermination, even if the IRS stops pursuing a levy, \nso long as the taxpayer continues to dispute her un-\npaid tax or underlying liability. That makes sense, \ngiven that the whole point of \u00a7 6330 is to make sure \nthat levy proceedings are fair and that a taxpayer can \nchallenge her liability if she had no prior opportunity \nto do so. Indeed, the very design of \u00a7 6330 seeks to en-\nsure that the government is \u201cturn[ing] square corners \n\n4 \n \n \nin dealing with the people,\u201d Department of Homeland \nSecurity v. Regents of the University of California, 591 \nU.S. 1, 24 (2020).  \nb. This case is not moot. The Tax Court had au-\nthority to determine Zuch\u2019s entitlement to the \nprepayments. See I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). A case is moot \nonly when the parties no longer retain any interest in \nthe outcome of the proceedings. But here, both parties \nhave a concrete interest in the outcome of the litiga-\ntion: If Zuch wins, the IRS will likely refund her \nmoney. If the IRS wins, it will keep her money. Either \nway, the Tax Court\u2019s ruling will be preclusive in a re-\nfund suit\u2014which the government has invited Zuch to \nfile\u2014so the stakes are real. And Zuch has now filed a \nrefund suit in the District of New Jersey seeking to \nrecover some of her overpayments. \n2. The IRS\u2019s counterarguments are meritless. \nThe IRS claims that the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to re-\nview the Appeals Office\u2019s determination vanished, and \nthat the case is moot, because the IRS decided it no \nlonger needed a levy after it took Zuch\u2019s money an-\nother way. The government\u2019s arguments fail.  \nFirst, the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to review \nwhether Zuch was entitled to the prepayments didn\u2019t \ndisappear once the IRS stopped pursuing the levy. \nPlain text makes that clear. Although the term \u201clevy\u201d \nappears throughout \u00a7 6330, the provision that grants \nthe Tax Court jurisdiction over the Appeals Office\u2019s \ndetermination\u2014\u00a7 6330(d)(1)\u2014doesn\u2019t condition juris-\ndiction on a levy. History and purpose don\u2019t help the \ngovernment, either. Congress enacted \u00a7 6330 to rem-\nedy IRS abuses and give taxpayers a fair shot at \ndisputing what they owe before collection, underscor-\ning why Congress likely wanted the Tax Court to \n\n5 \n \n \nretain jurisdiction to resolve disputes over unpaid tax \nand liability. Section 6330 must be construed in light \nof that remedial purpose.  \nInvoking Royal Canin U.S.A., Inc. v. Wullschleger, \n604 U.S. 22 (2025), the government claims that the \nTax Court lost jurisdiction because the IRS fundamen-\ntally altered the basis of the suit when it decided not \nto seek the levy. But again, \u00a7 6330 gave the Tax Court \njurisdiction to review an Appeals Office determination \nand nothing in the provision requires a levy. See I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1). Put differently, \u00a7 6330(d) gives the Tax \nCourt jurisdiction so long as the taxpayer challenges \nan Appeals Office determination. The Court recently \nmade clear in the \u00a7 6330 context that a procedural re-\nquirement is jurisdictional only if Congress \u201cclearly \nstates\u201d that it is. Boechler, P.C. v. Commissioner, 596 \nU.S. 199, 203 (2022). But the word \u201clevy\u201d doesn\u2019t even \nappear in \u00a7 6330(d). In any event, even if \u00a7 6330 re-\nquired a levy, the requirement would look to the time \nof filing, and there was a proposed levy when Zuch pe-\ntitioned the Tax Court.  \nAppealing to policy, the government says that if \nthe Tax Court has jurisdiction to review liability dis-\nputes like Zuch\u2019s, the Tax Court will become a forum \nfor general liability claims. For starters, the govern-\nment hasn\u2019t pointed to any cases showing that \ntaxpayers are invoking \u00a7 6330 to bring general liabil-\nity challenges. Plus, to invoke the Tax Court\u2019s \u00a7 6330 \njurisdiction, a taxpayer needs an Appeals Office deter-\nmination. The Tax Court can address unpaid tax or \nliability issues only if the Appeals Office\u2019s determina-\ntion resolved them. What\u2019s more, the question \npresented in this case rarely arises, and when it does, \nit\u2019s only because the IRS starts levy proceedings, gets \nthe taxpayer\u2019s money another way, and once the Tax \n\n6 \n \n \nCourt is reviewing the determination, decides to aban-\ndon the levy midstream. The IRS can easily avoid its \nself-made problem.  \nSecond, the government asserts that the Tax \nCourt lacks authority to declare Zuch\u2019s entitlement to \nthe prepayments because the Declaratory Judgment \nAct (DJA) and Anti-Injunction Act (AIA) generally \nprohibit courts from issuing declaratory and injunc-\ntive relief in federal tax cases. That argument fails. \nSection 6330(d)(1) authorizes the Tax Court to deter-\nmine the taxpayer\u2019s unpaid tax and underlying \nliability in \u00a7 6330 proceedings. And \u00a7 6330(e)(1) con-\nfirms that the Tax Court can issue declaratory relief, \nexempting \u00a7 6330 proceedings from the DJA\u2019s and \nAIA\u2019s prohibitions on declaratory and injunctive relief \nin other tax cases.  \nFinally, the government claims it mooted the case \nby abandoning the levy because the levy gave rise to \nthe proceeding. But that\u2019s not how moot\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

See I.R.C. \u00a7 6330. At the hearing, the \ntaxpayer may raise \u201cany relevant issue relating to the \nunpaid \ntax \nor \nthe \nproposed \nlevy.\u201d \nI.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A). The taxpayer may also challenge her \nunderlying tax liability if she did not previously have \nan opportunity to do so. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B). The Ap-\npeals Office issues a \u201cdetermination,\u201d which \u201cshall \ntake into consideration\u201d \u201cthe issues raised under par-\nagraph (2),\u201d including any challenge relating to the \nunpaid tax or the taxpayer\u2019s liability. I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(c)(3). After the Appeals Office renders its de-\ntermination, the taxpayer may \u201cpetition the Tax Court \nfor review of such determination,\u201d \u201cand the Tax Court \nshall have jurisdiction with respect to such matter.\u201d \nI.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). \nThe question presented is whether the Tax Court \nretains jurisdiction under I.R.C. \u00a7 6330 to review the \nAppeals Office\u2019s determination of the taxpayer\u2019s un-\npaid tax or underlying liability when, despite the \nparties\u2019 live dispute about that issue, the IRS stops \npursuing the levy, because it instead keeps the tax-\npayer\u2019s overpayments for later tax years. \n \n \n\nii \n \n \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDINGS AND \nRELATED PROCEEDINGS \nPetitioner\u2019s lists of the parties to the proceeding \nand directly related proceedings are complete and cor-\nrect. \n\niii \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \nQUESTION PRESENTED ........................................... i \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDINGS AND \nRELATED PROCEEDINGS ................................ ii \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES ....................................... vi \nINTRODUCTION ........................................................ 1 \nSTATEMENT .............................................................. 6 \nA.

The answer is yes. The Tax Court has juris-\ndiction under Internal Revenue Code \u00a7 6330(d)(1) to \nreview the Appeals Office\u2019s determination and the \nmatters and issues that determination resolves, and \nnothing in \u00a7 6330 conditions that jurisdiction on the \nIRS\u2019s continuing pursuit of a levy. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1); \nsee I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c). The Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to re-\nview the Appeals Office\u2019s determination thus gives the \ncourt authority to rule on the taxpayer\u2019s unpaid tax or \nunderlying liability. And because the government is \nexpected to abide by judicial rulings, those rulings \nwould redress Zuch\u2019s pocketbook injury. This case is \nnot moot. \nJennifer Zuch owed about $27,000 for the 2010 tax \nyear. But she and her ex-husband had already made \n$50,000 in estimated payments to the IRS for the 2010 \ntax year, and Zuch asked the IRS to apply those pay-\nments to her tax bill. Zuch\u2019s ex-husband agreed that \nthose tax payments should be applied to Zuch\u2019s tax \nbill. But the IRS refused. Instead, it applied the full \n$50,000 in estimated payments to Zuch\u2019s ex-husband\u2019s \nbalance. It then threatened to seize Zuch\u2019s property to \ncollect her 2010 tax assessment. \nZuch exercised her right to a hearing under \n\u00a7 6330, which provides taxpayers with procedural pro-\ntections before the IRS may levy their property to \ncollect taxes. Congress enacted \u00a7 6330 as part of the \nInternal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform \n\n2 \n \n \nAct in response to abusive IRS collections practices \nthat forced some taxpayers to spend their life\u2019s sav-\nings on taxes the IRS or courts later determined they \nnever even owed. Practices & Procedures of the Inter-\nnal Revenue Service: Hearings Before the Committee \non Finance, 105th Cong., S. Hrg. 105-190 at 75-82 \n(1997) [hereinafter Hearings Before the Committee on \nFinance] (statement of Katherine Lund Hicks). Sec-\ntion 6330 ensures that taxpayers can dispute their tax \nbill before having to pay. The provision allows taxpay-\ners threatened with a levy to initiate administrative \nhearings before the Appeals Office and to raise \u201cany \nrelevant issue relating to the unpaid tax\u201d or challenge \ntheir liability if they haven\u2019t yet had a chance to do so. \nI.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2). Section 6330 also grants taxpayers \nan opportunity for meaningful judicial review by \ngranting the Tax Court jurisdiction to review the Ap-\npeals Office\u2019s determination. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). \nAt her administrative hearing, Zuch argued that \nthe IRS should have credited her with the $50,000 in \nestimated payments that she and her ex-husband had \nmade. Those payments would have covered her 2010 \ntax bill and entitled her to a refund. The Appeals Of-\nfice disagreed, concluding that Zuch was not entitled \nto any portion of the estimated payments and uphold-\ning the proposed levy. Zuch petitioned the Tax Court \nfor review of the Appeals Office\u2019s determination. But \nduring the course of the Tax Court proceedings, the \nIRS kept overpayments that Zuch made for later tax \nyears and used them to offset her disputed 2010 lia-\nbility. By 2019, after six years of litigation, the IRS \nclaimed that Zuch had satisfied the disputed liability, \nand it moved to dismiss the Tax Court proceedings as \nmoot. \n\n3 \n \n \nThe Tax Court agreed and dismissed the petition. \nAccording to the court, because there was no unpaid \nliability and no levy, the case was moot. Pet. App. 43a. \nThe court of appeals vacated and remanded. In a \npart of the opinion joined by two panel members, the \ncourt held that the case was not moot because the Tax \nCourt had jurisdiction to review the Appeals Office\u2019s \ndetermination of and declare Zuch\u2019s liability. Pet. \nApp. 25a-26a; see Pet. App. 25a-38a. And a declara-\ntory judgment, the court concluded, would redress \nZuch\u2019s injury. Pet. App. 37a-38a. \nThe court of appeals correctly recognized that the \nTax Court had jurisdiction to review the Appeals Of-\nfice\u2019s determination and that this case is not moot. \nThis Court should affirm. \n1. a. The Tax Court had, and retained, jurisdic-\ntion to review the Appeals Office\u2019s determination. \nSection 6330\u2019s plain text states that the Tax Court \n\u201cshall have jurisdiction\u201d to \u201creview\u201d the Appeals Of-\nfice\u2019s \u201cdetermination,\u201d including its resolution of \u201cany \nrelevant issue relating to the unpaid tax,\u201d or the tax-\npayer\u2019s \u201cunderlying tax liability.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2), \n(c)(3), (d)(1). Nothing in that language, or anything \nelse in \u00a7 6330, requires an ongoing attempt to levy the \ntaxpayer\u2019s property. Thus, the Tax Court retains ju-\nrisdiction \nto \nreview \nthe \nAppeals \nOffice\u2019s \ndetermination, even if the IRS stops pursuing a levy, \nso long as the taxpayer continues to dispute her un-\npaid tax or underlying liability. That makes sense, \ngiven that the whole point of \u00a7 6330 is to make sure \nthat levy proceedings are fair and that a taxpayer can \nchallenge her liability if she had no prior opportunity \nto do so. Indeed, the very design of \u00a7 6330 seeks to en-\nsure that the government is \u201cturn[ing] square corners \n\n4 \n \n \nin dealing with the people,\u201d Department of Homeland \nSecurity v. Regents of the University of California, 591 \nU.S. 1, 24 (2020).  \nb. This case is not moot. The Tax Court had au-\nthority to determine Zuch\u2019s entitlement to the \nprepayments. See I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). A case is moot \nonly when the parties no longer retain any interest in \nthe outcome of the proceedings. But here, both parties \nhave a concrete interest in the outcome of the litiga-\ntion: If Zuch wins, the IRS will likely refund her \nmoney. If the IRS wins, it will keep her money. Either \nway, the Tax Court\u2019s ruling will be preclusive in a re-\nfund suit\u2014which the government has invited Zuch to \nfile\u2014so the stakes are real. And Zuch has now filed a \nrefund suit in the District of New Jersey seeking to \nrecover some of her overpayments. \n2. The IRS\u2019s counterarguments are meritless. \nThe IRS claims that the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to re-\nview the Appeals Office\u2019s determination vanished, and \nthat the case is moot, because the IRS decided it no \nlonger needed a levy after it took Zuch\u2019s money an-\nother way. The government\u2019s arguments fail.  \nFirst, the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to review \nwhether Zuch was entitled to the prepayments didn\u2019t \ndisappear once the IRS stopped pursuing the levy. \nPlain text makes that clear. Although the term \u201clevy\u201d \nappears throughout \u00a7 6330, the provision that grants \nthe Tax Court jurisdiction over the Appeals Office\u2019s \ndetermination\u2014\u00a7 6330(d)(1)\u2014doesn\u2019t condition juris-\ndiction on a levy. History and purpose don\u2019t help the \ngovernment, either. Congress enacted \u00a7 6330 to rem-\nedy IRS abuses and give taxpayers a fair shot at \ndisputing what they owe before collection, underscor-\ning why Congress likely wanted the Tax Court to \n\n5 \n \n \nretain jurisdiction to resolve disputes over unpaid tax \nand liability. Section 6330 must be construed in light \nof that remedial purpose.  \nInvoking Royal Canin U.S.A., Inc. v. Wullschleger, \n604 U.S. 22 (2025), the government claims that the \nTax Court lost jurisdiction because the IRS fundamen-\ntally altered the basis of the suit when it decided not \nto seek the levy. But again, \u00a7 6330 gave the Tax Court \njurisdiction to review an Appeals Office determination \nand nothing in the provision requires a levy. See I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1). Put differently, \u00a7 6330(d) gives the Tax \nCourt jurisdiction so long as the taxpayer challenges \nan Appeals Office determination. The Court recently \nmade clear in the \u00a7 6330 context that a procedural re-\nquirement is jurisdictional only if Congress \u201cclearly \nstates\u201d that it is. Boechler, P.C. v. Commissioner, 596 \nU.S. 199, 203 (2022). But the word \u201clevy\u201d doesn\u2019t even \nappear in \u00a7 6330(d). In any event, even if \u00a7 6330 re-\nquired a levy, the requirement would look to the time \nof filing, and there was a proposed levy when Zuch pe-\ntitioned the Tax Court.  \nAppealing to policy, the government says that if \nthe Tax Court has jurisdiction to review liability dis-\nputes like Zuch\u2019s, the Tax Court will become a forum \nfor general liability claims. For starters, the govern-\nment hasn\u2019t pointed to any cases showing that \ntaxpayers are invoking \u00a7 6330 to bring general liabil-\nity challenges. Plus, to invoke the Tax Court\u2019s \u00a7 6330 \njurisdiction, a taxpayer needs an Appeals Office deter-\nmination. The Tax Court can address unpaid tax or \nliability issues only if the Appeals Office\u2019s determina-\ntion resolved them. What\u2019s more, the question \npresented in this case rarely arises, and when it does, \nit\u2019s only because the IRS starts levy proceedings, gets \nthe taxpayer\u2019s money another way, and once the Tax \n\n6 \n \n \nCourt is reviewing the determination, decides to aban-\ndon the levy midstream. The IRS can easily avoid its \nself-made problem.  \nSecond, the government asserts that the Tax \nCourt lacks authority to declare Zuch\u2019s entitlement to \nthe prepayments because the Declaratory Judgment \nAct (DJA) and Anti-Injunction Act (AIA) generally \nprohibit courts from issuing declaratory and injunc-\ntive relief in federal tax cases. That argument fails. \nSection 6330(d)(1) authorizes the Tax Court to deter-\nmine the taxpayer\u2019s unpaid tax and underlying \nliability in \u00a7 6330 proceedings. And \u00a7 6330(e)(1) con-\nfirms that the Tax Court can issue declaratory relief, \nexempting \u00a7 6330 proceedings from the DJA\u2019s and \nAIA\u2019s prohibitions on declaratory and injunctive relief \nin other tax cases.  \nFinally, the government claims it mooted the case \nby abandoning the levy because the levy gave rise to \nthe proceeding. But that\u2019s not how mootness works. \nThe question is whether the parties retain any inter-\nest in the outcome of the litigation. And here, both \nZuch and the IRS have a concrete interest in whether \nand how the Tax Court adjudicates Zuch\u2019s entitlement \nto the estimated payments. \nThe Court should affirm the court of appeals\u2019 de-\ncision and remand so the Tax Court can consider \nZuch\u2019s merits arguments. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal background \n1. Taxpayers often have various ways to dispute \nthe amount of income taxes and other taxes the IRS \nclaims they owe. If the IRS determines that a taxpayer \nowes more taxes than she reported on her tax return, \n\n7 \n \n \nthe IRS typically sends her a notice of deficiency. \nI.R.C. \u00a7 6212(a). Within 90 days, the taxpayer may \nchallenge the claimed deficiency in Tax Court. I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6213(a). In the deficiency proceeding, the Tax Court \ncan determine the correct amount of tax owed and \nwhether the taxpayer made overpayments, entitling \nthe taxpayer to a refund or credit. I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6214(a), \n6512(b)(1). The Tax Court\u2019s final decision is reviewa-\nble by a court of appeals. I.R.C. \u00a7 7482(a)(1). If the \ntaxpayer does not challenge the deficiency, she can \npay the disputed amount and seek a refund in district \ncourt or the Court of Federal Claims. 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1346(a)(1); see I.R.C. \u00a7 7422(a).  \n2. This case centers on a third way a taxpayer \ncan challenge the taxes the IRS assesses when the \ntaxpayer has not paid the taxes the IRS claims she \nowes and the IRS seeks to collect by levying the tax-\npayer\u2019s property. Sometimes, a tax remains unpaid \neven after a taxpayer receives a notice of deficiency. \nOr perhaps a taxpayer hasn\u2019t paid the amount the IRS \nclaims she owes, but she didn\u2019t receive a notice of de-\nficiency or otherwise have an opportunity to dispute \nher liability. In either situation, the IRS may decide \nto pursue a levy on the taxpayer\u2019s property. I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6331(a), (b). \nIf the IRS issues a levy notice, the taxpayer has 30 \ndays to request an administrative hearing before the \nAppeals Office under I.R.C. \u00a7 6330, sometimes called \na \u201ccollection due process\u201d hearing, to challenge the \nproposed levy and her underlying tax liability. I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(b), (c)(2)(B); see Boechler, 596 U.S. at 202; \nByers v. Commissioner, 740 F.3d 668, 671-72 (D.C. \nCir. 2014). This case involves a \u00a7 6330 proceeding in \nwhich the parties dispute the taxpayer\u2019s liability and \nunpaid tax.  \n\n8 \n \n \na. The issues a taxpayer may raise in a collection \ndue process hearing depend in part on whether the \ntaxpayer received a notice of deficiency or had another \nopportunity to dispute her liability. If she did not, she \nmay raise \u201cchallenges to the existence or amount\u201d of \nher liability. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B). A collection due \nprocess hearing thus serves as a backstop, ensuring \nthat a taxpayer has an opportunity to dispute her un-\nderlying tax liability because she was not able to do so \nearlier. Liability challenges aside, all taxpayers in col-\nlection due process proceedings may raise \u201cany \nrelevant issue relating to the unpaid tax or the pro-\nposed levy, including\u201d \u201cappropriate spousal defenses,\u201d \n\u201cchallenges to the appropriateness of collection ac-\ntions,\u201d and \u201coffers of collection alternatives,\u201d no \nmatter whether they had an earlier opportunity to dis-\npute their liability. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A). The Appeals \nOffice then makes a \u201cdetermination\u201d that \u201cshall take \ninto consideration\u201d the taxpayer\u2019s challenge to the un-\npaid tax, her underlying liability, and any other issues \nraised. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(3). \nAlthough it is an important backstop, a collection \ndue process hearing \u201clacks the typical hallmarks of a \njudicial hearing\u201d and is \u201cfar from \u2026 a formal hearing.\u201d \nFarhy v. Commissioner, 100 F.4th 223, 227 (D.C. Cir. \n2024). \u201cThere are no formal discovery procedures, and \nthe taxpayer has no right to subpoena documents or \nwitnesses.\u201d Id. Rather, the hearing \u201cprovides the tax-\npayer \u2018an opportunity for an informal oral or written \nconversation with the IRS.\u2019\u201d Id. \nAfter the Appeals Office issues its \u201cdetermina-\ntion,\u201d the taxpayer may \u201cpetition the Tax Court for \nreview of such determination (and the Tax Court shall \nhave jurisdiction with respect to such matter).\u201d I.R.C. \n\n9 \n \n \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1). The Tax Court\u2019s final judgment is subject \nto review in a court of appeals. I.R.C. \u00a7 7482(a)(1). \nb. Congress enacted \u00a7 6330 in 1998 to protect \ntaxpayers from the IRS\u2019s abusive tax collection prac-\ntices. E.g., 144 Cong. Rec. S4027-32 (daily ed. May 1, \n1998). Leading up to \u00a7 6330\u2019s enactment, Congress \nheld a series of hearings that shed light on those prac-\ntices. For example, taxpayers couldn\u2019t contest a levy \nbefore the IRS seized their property. See Phillips v. \nCommissioner, 283 U.S. 589, 595-96 (1931). And tax-\npayers were often forced to drain their life\u2019s savings\u2014\nand their family\u2019s\u2014to pay assessments they never \neven owed. Hearings Before the Committee on Finance \nat 75-82 (statement of Katherine Lund Hicks). After \nthe hearings, \u201c[m]any people were shocked to learn \nthat a number of the due-process protections Ameri-\ncans take for granted in other legal proceedings do not \napply to actions involving the IRS.\u201d 144 Cong. Rec. \nS4031 (statement of Sen. Enzi). As one member put it, \n\u201cthe problem is, [the IRS] ha[s] too much power, they \nhave no checks and balances.\u201d Hearings Before the \nCommittee on Finance at 56 (statement of Sen. \nGramm). \nIn designing \u00a7 6330, Congress sought to \u201censure \nthat all taxpayers have due process and that the IRS \ndoes not abusively use its liens-and-seizure author-\nity.\u201d 143 Cong. Rec. S12231 (daily ed. Nov. 9, 1997) \n(statement of Sen. Roth). Indeed, the point of \u00a7 6330 \nproceedings is to \u201cincrease fairness to taxpayers\u201d be-\nfore the IRS deprives them of their property. S. Rep. \nNo. 105-174, at 67 (1998). And, as the Tax Court has \nobserved, Congress sought to ensure that the Commis-\nsioner would \u201ccollect the correct amount of tax, and do \nso by observing all applicable laws and administrative \n\n10 \n \n \nprocedures.\u201d Montgomery v. Commissioner, 122 T.C. \n1, 10 (2004). \nTo that end, \u00a7 6330 allows a taxpayer to raise is-\nsues relating to the unpaid tax and also challenge her \nliability if she did not have an earlier opportunity to \ndo so. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2). Section 6330 also gives the \ntaxpayer a chance \u201cto petition the Tax Court to contest \nthe Appeals [Office\u2019s] decision.\u201d 144 Cong. Rec. S4494 \n(daily ed. May 7, 1998) (statement of Sen. Hatch). And \nonce a taxpayer has petitioned the Tax Court, that \ncourt can enjoin any action or proceeding \u201cin respect \nof the unpaid tax or proposed levy.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(e)(1). \nThat makes sense: ensuring that the IRS is collecting \nthe correct amount of tax requires giving taxpayers an \nopportunity to dispute issues relating to the taxes \nthey haven\u2019t paid and their tax liability, and having \nthe Tax Court weigh in before the IRS can take their \nmoney. \nB. Factual and procedural background \nThis case arises from a dispute over whether the \nIRS properly credited $50,000 in overpayments from \nZuch and her ex-husband, Patrick Gennardo, to Gen-\nnardo\u2019s tax bill rather than Zuch\u2019s in the wake of their \ndivorce. Both Zuch and Gennardo maintain that the \nIRS should have credited Zuch\u2019s account, but the IRS \ninstead credited Gennardo\u2019s, sought to levy Zuch\u2019s \nproperty, and unilaterally decided to withhold over-\npayments Zuch made in later tax years. \n1. Zuch and Gennardo were married from 1993 \nto 2014. Pet. App. 7a. They separated in 2010, and \nZuch initiated divorce proceedings in 2012. CA3 \nApp. A118. During that time, the IRS assessed sub-\nstantial taxes against Zuch and Gennardo, prompting \nyears of litigation. \n\n11 \n \n \na. In 2010 and 2011, Zuch and Gennardo submit-\nted $50,000 in prepayments to the IRS for what they \nestimated would be their 2010 tax liability. Pet. \nApp. 8a. In particular, in June 2010, they submitted \nan estimated payment of $20,000 using a check drawn \nfrom a bank account listing both their names. Pet. \nApp. 8a & n.11. The form accompanying the check also \nlisted both names. Pet. App. 8a n.11, 51a. In January \n2011, Gennardo sent the IRS a check for $30,000. Pet. \nApp. 8a. The subject line of the letter accompanying \nthe check read \u201cRe: Patrick J. Gennardo and Jennifer \nZuch,\u201d and although the check was from Zuch and \nGennardo\u2019s joint bank account, the check listed only \nGennardo\u2019s name. Pet. App. 8a n.12, 51a. At the time, \nZuch and Gennardo didn\u2019t tell the IRS how to allocate \nthe payments. Pet. App. 8a. \nb. In 2012 and 2013, Zuch and Gennardo filed \nuntimely, and later amended, tax returns for 2010, \nand the IRS applied the $50,000 in prepayments to \nGennardo\u2019s, rather than Zuch\u2019s, tax bill. Pet. App. 7a-\n8a. The IRS\u2019s decision gave rise to the parties\u2019 dispute \nover Zuch\u2019s 2010 tax balance. \nIn September 2012, Zuch and Gennardo each filed \na married-filing-separately income tax return. Pet. \nApp. 7a. Zuch\u2019s return showed an adjusted gross in-\ncome of $74,493 and a $731 overpayment, and didn\u2019t \nmention the prepayments from 2010 and 2011. Pet. \nApp. 7a-8a & n.9. Gennardo\u2019s return showed an ad-\njusted gross income of $1,077,213, indicated that he \nowed $385,393 in taxes, and reported $10,000 in esti-\nmated payments. Pet. App. 8a-9a, 52a. The same day \nthat Gennardo filed his return, he also filed an offer-\nin-compromise, seeking to settle his accumulated tax \ndebts at less than the amount due. Id.; see I.R.C. \n\u00a7 7122(a). The IRS later notified him that it had \n\n12 \n \n \napplied the $50,000 in prepayments towards the \n$385,393 in taxes he owed. Pet. App. 8a. \nIn November 2012, Zuch filed an amended return \nfor 2010 to report $71,000 in additional income from a \nretirement account distribution. Pet. App. 9a. Zuch\u2019s \namended return showed that she owed the IRS \n$27,682. Id. She explained that the $50,000 in prepay-\nments should be credited to her and requested a \nrefund of $21,918. Id. In February 2013, the IRS as-\nsessed the additional $27,682 in taxes that Zuch \nreported, but it refused to credit her for the $50,000 or \nissue any refund. Id. \nGennardo also filed an amended return for 2010 \nin November 2012. Pet. App. 52a-53a. On that \namended return, he reported $0 in prepayments. Id. \nSubsequently, in March 2013, while his offer-in-com-\npromise was pending, Gennardo filed a second \namended return for 2010. Pet. App. 9a. He indicated \non that second amended return that the $50,000 in \nprepayments should be credited to Zuch, but the IRS \nstill refused to allocate it to her tax bill. Pet. App. 9a-\n10a; see Pet. App. 55a. \nc. Gennardo later submitted an amended offer-\nin-compromise in which he offered the IRS a signifi-\ncantly larger payment of tax, which the IRS accepted. \nPet. App. 10a. Even though Gennardo had asked the \nIRS to credit the $50,000 to Zuch, the IRS credited the \nentire sum to him. Id. \n2. Zuch never received a notice of deficiency from \nthe IRS. Pet. App. 9a n.13. But in August 2013, the \nIRS notified her that it intended to levy her property \nbecause she had failed to pay her 2010 tax assessment \nand explained that she had 30 days to request a \n\n13 \n \n \ncollection due process hearing before the Appeals Of-\nfice. Pet. App. 10a. \n3. Zuch timely requested a hearing. Id. At the \nhearing, Zuch challenged her \u201cunderlying tax liabil-\nity\u201d because she did not receive a notice of deficiency \nor otherwise have an opportunity to dispute it. I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B); Pet. App. 10a. Zuch argued that the \n$50,000 in prepayments should have been credited to \nher, reducing her tax liability to $0 and entitling her \nto a refund. Pet. App. 10a. \nIn September 2014, the Appeals Office rejected \nZuch\u2019s \u201c[c]hallenges to [her] [l]iability,\u201d Pet. App. 66a, \nand sustained the proposed levy. It told Zuch that it \nwas \u201cnot in a position\u201d to credit her for the $50,000 \nbecause the IRS had credited the money to Gennardo. \nPet. App. 11a. \n4. Zuch petitioned the Tax Court to review the \nAppeals Office\u2019s determination. Id. In particular, she \nsought a ruling that the $50,000 should have been ap-\nplied to her individual tax balance. Id. After the IRS \nmoved for summary judgment, the Tax Court re-\nmanded to the Appeals Office because it wasn\u2019t clear \nwhy the IRS had applied the $50,000 towards Gen-\nnardo\u2019s liability rather than Zuch\u2019s. Pet. App. 11a-\n12a. \n5. In June 2017, the Appeals Office again ruled \nagainst Zuch on the \u201c[i]ssues relating to [her] unpaid \n[underlying] liability,\u201d Pet. App. 48a, and sustained \nthe proposed levy, Pet. App. 12a. It reasoned that the \nlevy \u201cbalance[d] the need for efficient collection of \ntaxes with the taxpayer\u2019s legitimate concern that any \ncollection action be no more intrusive than necessary.\u201d \nCA3 App. A270. \n\n14 \n \n \n6. The case returned to the Tax Court. Pet. \nApp. 12a. Meanwhile, over the course of the six years \nthe \u00a7 6330 proceedings had been pending, Zuch kept \npaying her taxes for later years. In fact, she overpaid. \nBut rather than issuing her refunds, the IRS kept \nZuch\u2019s overpayments and used them to offset her \nclaimed 2010 liability. Pet. App. 12a-13a. The IRS did \nso six times, \u201conce each in 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2019, \nand twice in 2016.\u201d Id. And in April 2019, after the \ncase had returned to the Tax Court, the IRS kept \nZuch\u2019s money a final time to offset the rest of her \nclaimed 2010 tax balance, reducing it to $0. Pet. \nApp. 13a. \nThe IRS then moved to dismiss the Tax Court pro-\nceedings as moot. Id. The Tax Court granted the \nmotion. Id. The Tax Court concluded that it lacked ju-\nrisdiction over the case and that the case was moot \nbecause \u201cthere [was] no unpaid liability \u2026 upon which \na levy could be based,\u201d and the IRS was no longer \nseeking to levy Zuch\u2019s property. Pet. App. 43a. \n7. The Third Circuit vacated the Tax Court\u2019s de-\ncision, held that the Tax Court had jurisdiction under \n\u00a7 6330 to decide Zuch\u2019s challenge to her tax liability or \nunpaid tax, held that the case wasn\u2019t moot, and re-\nmanded for proceedings on the merits. Pet. App. 1a-\n39a. \nThe court first held that the Tax Court had juris-\ndiction to review the Appeals Office\u2019s determination of \nZuch\u2019s liability. Because Zuch had neither received a \nnotice of deficiency nor had an opportunity to contest \nher liability before her collection due process hearing, \nZuch could challenge \u201cthe existence or amount of [her] \nunderlying tax liability\u201d during the hearing. Pet. \nApp. 14a-15a; (quoting I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B)). And, \n\n15 \n \n \nthe court explained, \u201cZuch\u2019s argument that her esti-\nmated tax payments were erroneously allocated to her \nex-husband is a challenge to her underlying tax liabil-\nity under \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B).\u201d Pet. App. 19a. \nThe court of appeals then held that the Tax Court \nhad jurisdiction over Zuch\u2019s challenge, and that Zuch\u2019s \nchallenge was not moot, for two independent reasons. \nPet. App. 19a-38a. First, the court held that Zuch \ncould continue challenging her underlying liability be-\ncause the IRS unlawfully offset it using her \noverpayments in later years. Pet. App. 19a-25a. The \nIRS\u2019s unilateral, illegal actions, the court held, could \nnot moot the case. Pet. App. 25a. Second, in a part of \nthe opinion joined by two panel members, the court \nheld that the Tax Court had jurisdiction to review the \nAppeals Office\u2019s determination of Zuch\u2019s liability and \nissue a declaratory judgment because the parties con-\ntinued to dispute Zuch\u2019s tax liability. Pet. App. 25a-\n26a; see Pet. App. 25a-38a. And a declaratory judg-\nment, the court concluded, would redress Zuch\u2019s \ninjuries. Pet. App. 37a-38a. \n8. The IRS sought rehearing en banc, which the \ncourt of appeals denied. Pet. App. 68a-69a. It then \nsought a writ of certiorari, which this Court granted \non January 10, 2025. \n9. On March 14, 2025, Zuch filed a suit in the \nU.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey seek-\ning refunds for the 2010, 2012, 2013, and 2018 tax \nyears pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(a)(1) and I.R.C. \n\u00a7 7422(a). Compl., Zuch v. United States, No. 2:25-cv-\n01900 (D.N.J. Mar. 14, 2025). If successful, Zuch will \nrecover approximately two-thirds of the taxes the IRS \ncollected after it refused to credit her for the estimated \npayments. See Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 108-09. But Zuch is unable \n\n16 \n \n \nto request the return of approximately $20,000 in \noverpayments the IRS kept from the 2014 and 2015 \ntax years, due to the onerous jurisdictional prerequi-\nsites to filing a refund suit. Compl. \u00b6 109. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI. \nThe Tax Court had jurisdiction to review \nZuch\u2019s challenge relating to her unpaid tax or under-\nlying tax liability, and to adjudicate her entitlement \nto the estimated payments. The Tax Court retained \nthat jurisdiction and authority to issue a binding rul-\ning even after the IRS stopped pursuing the levy. This \ncase isn\u2019t moot.  \nA.  The Tax Court had, and retained, jurisdiction \nto review the Appeals Office\u2019s determination of Zuch\u2019s \nestimated payment dispute. \n1. Section 6330\u2019s plain text makes clear that the \nTax Court has authority to review the Appeals Office\u2019s \ndetermination of a taxpayer\u2019s challenge relating to her \nunpaid tax or underlying liability. Section 6330 pro-\nvides that a taxpayer may raise \u201cany relevant issue \nrelating to the unpaid tax\u201d at a collection due process \nhearing, and also may raise a challenge to her \u201cunder-\nlying tax liability\u201d when she didn\u2019t have an \nopportunity to do so before. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2). The \nAppeals Office\u2019s \u201cdetermination\u201d must \u201ctake [those is-\nsues] into consideration,\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(3), and the \nTax Court \u201cshall have jurisdiction\u201d to review that de-\ntermination, I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). Nothing in those \nprovisions makes jurisdiction turn on a continuing-\nlevy requirement, much less satisfies the requirement \nthat jurisdictional prerequisites be clearly stated, see \nBoechler, 596 U.S. at 203. The Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction \nunder \u00a7 6330 thus doesn\u2019t vanish when the IRS stops \npursuing a levy. \n\n17 \n \n \n2.  Context confirms that Congress gave the Tax \nCourt continuing jurisdiction under \u00a7 6330 to review \nAppeals Office determinations, including their resolu-\ntion of unpaid tax and tax liability issues. Section \n6330(c)(2)(B) ensures that a taxpayer has a chance to \nchallenge the unpaid tax and her underlying liability \nbefore she must pay or face a levy, and without initi-\nating new litigation against the federal government to \nseek a refund, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(a)(1); I.R.C. \n\u00a7 7422(a).  \n3.  The Tax Court had jurisdiction to review the \nAppeals Office\u2019s determination, including Zuch\u2019s enti-\ntlement to the estimated payments. In proceedings \nbefore the Appeals Office, Zuch challenged the IRS\u2019s \nrefusal to apply the estimated payments to her tax \nbill. The Appeals Office rejected her arguments. Zuch \nthen petitioned the Tax Court for review of the Ap-\npeals Office\u2019s determination\u2014including its resolution \nof the unpaid tax or underlying liability dispute. And \nthe Tax Court had jurisdiction under \u00a7 6330 to review \nthe determination of those issues.  \nB. Zuch\u2019s case wasn\u2019t mooted when the IRS de-\ncided that it no longer needed the levy. A case is moot \nonly if the parties no longer have a concrete interest \nin the outcome, and the court can\u2019t issue any relief \nthat would redress a party\u2019s injury. But here, the Tax \nCourt could issue a ruling deciding whether Zuch is \nentitled to have the $50,000 in estimated payments \napplied to her tax bill. So both parties have an interest \nhere. If Zuch prevails, the IRS is likely to issue a re-\nfund, and if the government prevails, the IRS will \nkeep her money. And win or lose, a judgment from the \nTax Court will be preclusive in the refund suit that \nZuch has now filed in the U.S. District Court for the \nDistrict of New Jersey. \n\n18 \n \n \nII. The government\u2019s counterarguments are un-\npersuasive.  \nA. The government claims that the Tax Court\u2019s \njurisdiction to review a taxpayer\u2019s liability challenge \nrequires a continuing attempt to levy the taxpayer\u2019s \nproperty. That is incorrect\u2014the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdic-\ntion didn\u2019t disappear once the IRS no longer needed \nthe levy. \n1. There is no textual basis for the government\u2019s \ncontinuing-levy requirement. To be sure, \u00a7 6330 men-\ntions the word \u201clevy\u201d\u2014after all, a taxpayer can initiate \nadministrative collection due process proceedings be-\nfore the Appeals Office only after being notified that \nthe IRS is going to levy her property. See I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(a)(3)(B), (b)(1). But once the Appeals Office is-\nsues a determination, the taxpayer can seek Tax \nCourt review of the determination under \u00a7 6330(d)(1). \nSection 6330(d)(1)\u2019s plain terms impose no continuing-\nlevy requirement, much less a \u201cclearly state[d]\u201d juris-\ndictional requirement, Boechler, 596 U.S. at 203. \nWhat\u2019s more, the presumption favoring judicial re-\nview of agency actions supports reading \u00a7 6330(d)(1) \nto confer jurisdiction even if the government abandons \nits levy efforts. See Guerrero-Lasprilla v. Barr, 589 \nU.S. 221, 229 (2020). In arguing otherwise, what the \nIRS is really saying is that, in its view, the Tax Court \ncannot redress a taxpayer\u2019s pocketbook injury when \nthere is no pending levy. But that\u2019s not the case, ei-\nther, as this case makes plain.  \n2. Section 6330\u2019s history and purpose confirm \nthat the Tax Court retains jurisdiction over an unpaid \ntax or liability challenge even after the IRS says it \ndoesn\u2019t need a levy anymore. Congress crafted \u00a7 6330 \nas remedial legislation in response to the IRS\u2019s \n\n19 \n \n \nabusive collection practices as part of a statutory \nscheme to increase fairness to taxpayers by allowing \nthem to challenge what they owe before they pay or \nhave their property seized. In light of that remedial \npurpose, \u00a7 6330 should be construed to mean what it \nsays\u2014the Tax Court has jurisdiction over the Appeals \nOffice\u2019s \u201cdetermination.\u201d \n3. Royal Canin doesn\u2019t suggest otherwise. The \ngovernment argues that the IRS fundamentally al-\ntered the basis of the suit when it decided not to seek \nthe levy. But the basis of the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction \nis the Appeals Office\u2019s determination, not any levy. \nAnd decisions holding that jurisdiction depends on the \nstate of play at the time the suit is brought show that \neven assuming \u00a7 6330 contains a pending-levy re-\nquirement, that requirement turns on the time of \nfiling and thus is met here: there was a levy pending \nwhen Zuch petitioned the Tax Court. \n4.  Policy can\u2019t salvage the government\u2019s position, \neither. The government claims that, if the Tax Court \nhas jurisdiction to review a taxpayer\u2019s liability in a \n\u00a7 6330 proceeding after the IRS determines it no \nlonger needs the levy, the floodgates will open and \n\u00a7 6330 proceedings will become a forum for all kinds \nof liability challenges. But the taxpayer may raise a \nliability issue in a collection due process proceeding \nonly when she did not have an earlier opportunity to \ndo so. Plus, the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction is tied to the \nissues raised before, and determined by, the Appeals \nOffice in the first place. There\u2019s no risk that the Tax \nCourt will begin exercising free-wheeling jurisdiction \nover \u201cgeneral\u201d liability disputes. What\u2019s more, the \nquestion presented rarely arises, and when it does, it\u2019s \nonly because of \u201cthe IRS\u2019s own recalcitrance.\u201d \nBoechler, 596 U.S. at 207. So even if there were a \n\n20 \n \n \nfloodgates problem, it would be the government\u2019s own \ndoing. \nB. The government claims that the Tax Court \nlacks authority to issue a judgment regarding Zuch\u2019s \nentitlement to the estimated payments. In the govern-\nment\u2019s view, the Tax Court can enjoin only a collection \naction in a \u00a7 6330 proceeding, and can\u2019t issue declara-\ntory relief at all. That argument is meritless. \nSection 6330(d)(1) authorizes the Tax Court to deter-\nmine the taxpayer\u2019s unpaid tax and underlying \nliability, and issue a judgment about those issues. And \n\u00a7 6330(e)(1), which allows injunctions \u201cin respect of \nthe unpaid tax or proposed levy,\u201d confirms that the \nTax Court can issue declaratory relief determining a \ntaxpayer\u2019s rights in a challenge involving her liability \nor unpaid tax. The DJA doesn\u2019t provide otherwise, be-\ncause \u00a7 6330(e)(1) exempts \u00a7 6330 from the DJA\u2019s \nprohibition on declaratory relief in most tax cases.  \nC. The government\u2019s other mootness arguments \nfail, too. The government contends that the case is \nmoot because, once the IRS decides not to pursue a \nlevy, \u201cthe issue that prompted the Section 6330 pro-\nceeding is no longer \u2018live.\u2019\u201d Br. 21. But the mootness \ninquiry asks whether the parties retain any interest \nin the outcome of the litigation, and thus whether the \ncourt can redress the plaintiff\u2019s injury. The parties \nhave a concrete interest here, because the Tax Court \ncan decide whether Zuch or the IRS is entitled to the \nmoney.  \nD. Finally, the government mentions in a foot-\nnote that Zuch\u2019s challenge relates to her unpaid tax, \nrather than her underlying liability. But the govern-\nment concedes (Br. 25 n.3) that the dispute is \n\n21 \n \n \nimmaterial. Indeed, as Zuch has explained, the Tax \nCourt had, and retained, jurisdiction either way. \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe Tax Court had jurisdiction under I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330 to review and rule on Zuch\u2019s unpaid \ntax or tax liability, so the case isn\u2019t moot. \nA. The Tax Court had jurisdiction to review \nthe Appeals Office\u2019s determination of \nZuch\u2019s entitlement to the estimated \npayments. \nSection 6330\u2019s text and context make clear that \nthe Tax Court had jurisdiction to review Zuch\u2019s chal-\nlenge to her unpaid tax or underlying tax liability, \neven after the IRS stopped pursuing the levy. \n1. Section 6330\u2019s plain text states that \nthe Tax Court has jurisdiction to \nreview \nthe \nAppeals \nOffice\u2019s \n\u201cdetermination\u201d \nof \na \ntaxpayer\u2019s \nchallenge to \u201cany relevant issue \nrelating to [her] unpaid tax\u201d or her \n\u201cunderlying liability.\u201d  \na. During the collection due process hearing, the \nAppeals Office can determine \u201cany relevant issue re-\nlating to the unpaid tax,\u201d and, if the taxpayer \u201cdid not \nreceive any statutory notice of deficiency \u2026 or did not \notherwise have an opportunity to dispute\u201d it, the tax-\npayer may also challenge \u201cthe existence or amount of \nthe underlying tax liability.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2). A tax-\npayer challenges her underlying tax liability by \ndisputing \u201cthe amounts that the Commissioner as-\nsessed for a particular tax period.\u201d Jeffers v. \nCommissioner, 992 F.3d 649, 653 n.4 (7th Cir. 2021); \naccord Montgomery, 122 T.C. at 7-8. For example, the \n\n22 \n \n \ntaxpayer challenges her underlying tax liability when \nshe claims that the IRS misapplied a credit, if properly \napplying the credit \u201cwould eliminate the outstanding \ntax liability.\u201d Peoplease, LLC v. Commissioner, \nNo. 2161-24L, 2025 WL 429626, at *2 (T.C. Feb. 6, \n2025). Similarly, when a taxpayer raises challenges \nrelating to the unpaid portion of the underlying tax \nliability, she raises an issue related to the unpaid tax. \nSee Internal Revenue Service Chief Counsel Notice \nCC-2014-002 at 3 (May 5, 2014) (\u201c\u2018Unpaid tax\u2019 refers \nto that part of the underlying tax liability not paid by \nthe taxpayer.\u201d).  \nOnce the Appeals Office issues a determination, \nthe taxpayer may \u201cpetition the Tax Court for review \nof [the Appeals Office\u2019s] determination,\u201d \u201cand the Tax \nCourt shall have jurisdiction with respect to such mat-\nter.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). That means the Tax Court \nreviews the \u201cdetermination\u201d of all \u201cthe issues\u201d raised \nduring the hearing. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2), (c)(3)(B). So \nwhen the Tax Court reviews the Appeals Office\u2019s de-\ntermination, it can resolve any dispute about any \nissue relating to the unpaid tax or the taxpayer\u2019s un-\nderlying tax liability that the taxpayer properly raised \nbefore the Appeals Office. See id. \nb. The Tax Court doesn\u2019t lose its jurisdiction to \nresolve a challenge to the Appeals Office determina-\ntion just because the IRS decides to stop pursuing the \nlevy. Congress provided that the Tax Court \u201cshall \nhave jurisdiction\u201d to review the Appeals Office\u2019s deter-\nmination. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1) (emphasis added). That \nreview necessarily reaches all live \u201cissues\u201d involved in \nthe Appeal\u2019s Office\u2019s determination. And those issues \nexpressly include, as relevant here, \u201cany relevant is-\nsue relating to the unpaid tax\u201d and any \u201cchallenges to \nthe existence or amount of the underlying tax \n\n23 \n \n \nliability,\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2), (c)(3)(B). So long as an \nunpaid tax or liability issue remains disputed, nothing \nin \u00a7 6330 suggests the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to re-\nview the question vanishes when the IRS collects the \namount due another way and no longer needs the levy. \nAt most, whether there is a pending levy could affect \nwhat kind of relief the Tax Court can grant. But it \ndoesn\u2019t present any question about jurisdiction under \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1). As explained below (at 28-29), the Tax \nCourt can rule on a taxpayer\u2019s unpaid tax or underly-\ning liability when there are live disputes about those \nissues. \nc. Section 6330\u2019s history confirms that Congress \ndeliberately vested the Tax Court with jurisdiction to \nresolve disputes over a taxpayer\u2019s underlying liability \nand wanted the Tax Court to retain that jurisdiction. \nBefore 2006, \u00a7 6330 provided that taxpayers could \nseek review of the Appeals Office\u2019s determination in \nfederal district court \u201cif the Tax Court [did] not have \njurisdiction of the underlying tax liability.\u201d I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1) (2000). Practically, that language meant \nthat the Tax Court had jurisdiction to review the Ap-\npeals Office\u2019s determination of a liability dispute only \nif the dispute concerned income, estate, or gift taxes, \nbecause the Tax Court already had jurisdiction to re-\nview those kinds of disputes in deficiency proceedings. \nMoore v. Commissioner, 114 T.C. 171, 175 (2000). But \nCongress changed that in 2006 and made clear that \nthe Tax Court \u201cshall\u201d review the taxpayer\u2019s disputed \nliability in all cases. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). Thus, Con-\ngress ensured that \u201cthe Tax Court [has] jurisdiction \nover issues arising from a collection due process hear-\ning\u201d by \u201cconsolidat[ing] all judicial review of \u2026 \ncollection due process determinations,\u201d including a \ntaxpayer\u2019s underlying tax liability, in the Tax Court. \n\n24 \n \n \nStaff of J. Comm. on Taxation, 109th Cong., Descrip-\ntion of the Revenue Provisions Contained in the \nPresident\u2019s Fiscal Year 2007 Budget Proposal 230-31 \n(Comm. Print 2006); accord Staff of J. Comm. On Tax-\nation, 109th Cong., Technical Explanation of H.R. 4, \nThe \u201cPension Protection Act of 2006,\u201d as Passed By the \nHouse on July 28, 2006, and as Considered by the Sen-\nate on August 3, 2006 (Comm. Print. 2006). \n2. Statutory \ncontext \nconfirms \nthat \nCongress \ngave \nthe \nTax \nCourt \ncontinuing jurisdiction to resolve \nissues relating to the unpaid tax and \ntax liability disputes. \nStatutory context shows why Congress likely gave \nthe Tax Court authority to review the issues underly-\ning the Appeals Office\u2019s determination. \nAs noted (at 6-7), in some circumstances, the IRS \nissues a notice of deficiency to a taxpayer, who can \nthen challenge her assessed liability in Tax Court be-\nfore the IRS collects. See I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6212(a), 6512(a). \nBut sometimes the taxpayer doesn\u2019t receive a notice of \ndeficiency or have another opportunity to dispute the \nliability before the IRS seeks to levy the taxpayer\u2019s \nproperty, as in Zuch\u2019s case. See I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B). \nTo ensure that taxpayers have that opportunity, Con-\ngress gave taxpayers the right to dispute their \nliability. Id. Similarly, Congress gave taxpayers the \nright to raise \u201cany relevant issue relating to the un-\npaid tax,\u201d no matter whether they received a notice of \ndeficiency or otherwise had the opportunity to chal-\nlenge the liability. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A). And \nCongress directed the Appeals Office and Tax Court to \nresolve those challenges. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(3), (d)(1). \n\n25 \n \n \nEven if the IRS is able to terminate the levy after \nthe taxpayer initiates \u00a7 6330 proceedings, it makes \nsense for the Tax Court to finish resolving the unpaid \ntax or underlying liability dispute if it remains live. \nAfter all, if the dispute continues past the levy, closing \nthe Tax Court\u2019s doors would simply require the tax-\npayer to file another lawsuit, this time seeking a \nrefund under I.R.C. \u00a7 7422 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(a)(1). \nAnd that would undermine the \u201cdesign[]\u201d of the Tax \nCode \u201cto insure an orderly administration of the reve-\nnue.\u2019\u201d United States v. Clintwood Elkhorn Mining Co., \n553 U.S. 1, 11 (2008). It also would contravene the \ngovernment\u2019s fundamental obligation to \u201cturn square \ncorners in dealing with the people,\u201d Regents of the Uni-\nversity of California, 591 U.S. at 24, by pulling the rug \nout from under a taxpayer who has been litigating \nagainst the IRS for years and forcing her to start new \nlitigation in a different forum.  \nCongress passed \u00a7 6330 to avoid heavy-handed \nIRS tactics, not authorize them in the form of jurisdic-\ntional gamesmanship. And in what is known as the \nTaxpayer Bill of Rights, Congress has also instructed \nthe IRS to \u201censure that employees of the Internal Rev-\nenue Service are familiar with and act in accord with \ntaxpayer rights as afforded by other provisions of this \ntitle.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 7803(a)(3); see Taxpayer Bill of Rights, \nIRS, https://www.irs.gov/taxpayer-bill-of-rights (last \nvisited March 17, 2025). Those rights include \u201cthe \nright to pay no more than the correct amount of tax\u201d; \n\u201cthe right to challenge the position of the Internal \nRevenue Service and be heard\u201d; \u201cthe right to appeal a \ndecision of the Internal Revenue Service in an inde-\npendent forum\u201d; and \u201cthe right to finality.\u201d I.R.C. \n\u00a7 7803(a)(3)(C)-(F). Those rights underscore that the \nTax Court\u2019s jurisdiction under \u00a7 6330 does not vanish \n\n26 \n \n \njust because the IRS seeks to cut off the taxpayer\u2019s \nrights to challenge the agency\u2019s position. By the same \ntoken, nothing in I.R.C. \u00a7 6402, which governs offsets, \npurports to limit the Tax Court\u2019s authority to deter-\nmine the taxpayer\u2019s unpaid tax or liability under \n\u00a7 6330, and reading the provisions that way would in-\nsert words into the statute and contravene the \nTaxpayer Bill of Rights.  \n3. The Tax Court had jurisdiction under \n\u00a7 6330 to review the Appeals Office\u2019s \ndetermination, \nincluding \nits \nresolution of Zuch\u2019s entitlement to \nthe estimated payments. \nThe Tax Court had jurisdiction under \u00a7 6330 to re-\nview the Appeals Office\u2019s determination that Zuch \nwas not entitled to the estimated payments. \nZuch challenged the IRS\u2019s allocation of the esti-\nmated tax payments in the collection due process \nproceedings. In particular, she claimed that she did \nnot owe the IRS the $27,682 for the 2010 tax year be-\ncause the estimated payments should have been \ncredited to her. Pet. App. 9a; see Jeffers, 992 F.3d at \n653 n.4; Peoplease, 2025 WL 429626, at *2. Zuch had \na right to dispute that liability (or unpaid tax, if the \nIRS would prefer to classify it that way). Zuch did not \nreceive a notice of deficiency or otherwise have an op-\nportunity to challenge her claimed liability. Pet. \nApp. 10a. Regardless, Zuch was also entitled to raise \nher challenge as a \u201crelevant issue relating to the un-\npaid tax.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A).  \nAfter the Appeals Office made its determination, \nZuch timely petitioned the Tax Court for review. CA3 \nApp. A24-A30; see CA3 App. A266-270; Pet. App. 41a-\n42a. The Tax Court then had jurisdiction over the \n\n27 \n \n \nAppeals Office\u2019s decision, including the dispute over \nthe estimated payments. See I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2), \n(c)(3)(B), (d)(1). \nTo be sure, while the case was before the Tax \nCourt\u2014and after more than six years of litigation\u2014\nthe IRS announced that it was abandoning the levy. \nBut that didn\u2019t deprive the Tax Court of jurisdiction \nunder \u00a7 6330. Nothing in \u00a7 6330 purports to condition \nthe Tax Court\u2019s ongoing jurisdiction on the IRS\u2019s con-\ntinued pursuit of a levy. \nB. Zuch\u2019s case did not become moot when \nthe IRS decided to stop pursuing the \nlevy, because the parties disputed, and \nthe \nTax \nCourt \nhad \nthe \npower \nto \nadjudicate, Zuch\u2019s entitlement to the \nestimated payments. \nZuch\u2019s case isn\u2019t moot just because the IRS de-\ncided it no longer needed a levy. Mootness comes into \nplay only when the parties no longer have a concrete \ninterest in the outcome. But both Zuch and the IRS \nhave a concrete interest here because the Tax Court \ncan still decide Zuch\u2019s challenge to the Appeals Of-\nfice\u2019s \nunderlying \nliability \nor \nunpaid \ntax \ndeterminations and then rule that Zuch is entitled to \nthe estimated payments. If the Tax Court so rules, the \nIRS is likely to abide by that ruling and issue a refund. \nBut even if the IRS doesn\u2019t issue a refund, the Tax \nCourt\u2019s judgment would be preclusive in the refund \naction Zuch has brought in the District of New Jersey.  \n\n28 \n \n \n1. A case becomes moot only when the \nparties no longer have a concrete \ninterest \nin \nthe outcome \nof the \nlitigation and judicial relief is not \nlikely to redress any injury.  \nThe mootness inquiry asks whether standing \u201cex-\nists throughout the proceedings.\u201d Uzuegbunam v. \nPreczewski, 592 U.S. 279, 282 (2021). The \u201cirreducible \nconstitutional minimum of standing contains three el-\nements\u201d: \n(1) injury \nin \nfact, \n(2) causation \n(i.e., \ntraceability), and (3) redressability. Lujan v. Defend-\ners of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992). \u201cAs long \nas the parties have a concrete interest, however small, \nin the outcome of the litigation, the case is not moot.\u201d \nCampbell-Ewald Co. v. Gomez, 577 U.S. 153, 161 \n(2016). Thus, redressability requires only that judicial \nrelief \u201clikely\u201d will redress an injury, Federal Election \nCommission v. Cruz, 596 U.S. 289, 296 (2022), not \nthat \u201ca favorable decision will relieve\u201d \u201cevery injury,\u201d \nLarson v. Valente, 456 U.S. 228, 243-44 & n.15 (1982) \n(first emphasis added).  \n2. Zuch\u2019s challenge isn\u2019t moot because a \nfavorable \nTax \nCourt \nruling \non \nunderlying liability or unpaid tax \nwould likely redress her pocketbook \ninjury. \nZuch satisfies all three requirements of standing. \nShe suffered a concrete injury when the IRS applied \nthe $50,000 in estimated payments to her ex-hus-\nband\u2019s balance, rather than her own. See, e.g., \nTransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413, 425 \n(2021). If the IRS had applied the estimated payments \nto Zuch\u2019s account\u2014as both she and her ex-husband \nhad \nrequested\u2014Zuch \nwould \nhave \ngotten \nher \n\n29 \n \n \noverpayments back in later years. But, having refused \nto apply the estimated payments to Zuch\u2019s tax bill, the \nIRS kept her overpayments instead. Zuch\u2019s monetary \ninjury is thus traceable to the IRS\u2019s refusal to apply \nthe $50,000 in estimated payments to her 2010 tax \nbill. See Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Or-\nganization, 426 U.S. 26, 41-42 (1976). And the Tax \nCourt can redress Zuch\u2019s injury by ruling that the Ap-\npeals Office was wrong about her liability or unpaid \ntax and thus determining that Zuch is entitled to the \n$50,000 in estimated payments. \nAs noted, the Appeals Office\u2019s \u201cdetermination\u201d \n\u201cshall take into consideration\u201d \u201cthe issues raised\u201d at \nthe hearing, I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(3)(B), including \u201cany rel-\nevant issue relating to the unpaid tax\u201d and \u201cthe \nexistence or amount of the underlying tax liability,\u201d \nI.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2). And because the Tax Court \u201cshall \nhave jurisdiction\u201d to review \u201csuch determination,\u201d \nI.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1), the Tax Court can decide a tax-\npayer\u2019s unpaid tax or underlying tax liability, too. \nAccord Michael I. Saltzman & Leslie Book, IRS Prac-\ntice & Procedure \u00a7 14B.16[4][a] (updated Oct. 2024). \nIn Zuch\u2019s case, that means the Tax Court can rule on \nwhether she is entitled to credit for the estimated pay-\nments, underscoring both parties\u2019 concrete interest in \nthe outcome of the case. See Pet. App. 33a-34a, 42a. \nIf the Tax Court rules that Zuch is entitled to the \nestimated payments, the IRS is likely to issue Zuch a \nrefund. That\u2019s because \u201cit is substantially likely that \n[the IRS] would abide by\u201d that \u201cauthoritative\u201d holding \n\u201cby the [Tax] Court.\u201d Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 \nU.S. 788, 803 (1992); accord Reed v. Goertz, 598 U.S. \n230, 234 (2023); Pet. App. 38a. Indeed, it would be \nquite remarkable for the IRS to simply ignore the Tax \nCourt and decide not to return to Zuch the money that \n\n30 \n \n \na court has determined the IRS has no legal right to \nkeep. That is especially true because the Tax Court \nnot only has authority to review and rule on the un-\nderlying \nliability \nand \nunpaid \ntax \nissues \nin \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1), but it also has authority to put those rul-\nings into a declaratory judgment under \u00a7 6330(e), as \nexplained below (at 40-42). The consequence is that \nthe Tax Court will have \u201c\u2018ordered a change in a legal \nstatus,\u2019 and \u2018the practical consequence of that change \nwould amount to a significant increase in the likeli-\nhood\u2019\u201d that the IRS will give Zuch her money back. \nReed, 598 U.S. at 234. The Tax Court\u2019s authority to \nissue a \u201cdefinitive determination of the legal rights of \nthe parties,\u201d Medtronic, Inc. v. Mirowski Family Ven-\ntures, LLC, 571 U.S. 191, 200 (2014); see Haaland v. \nBrackeen, 599 U.S. 255, 293 (2023), leaves no doubt \nthat the court has the power to grant effective relief. \nEven if the IRS doesn\u2019t issue Zuch a refund, Zuch \nhas filed a refund suit in the District of New Jersey \nunder I.R.C. \u00a7 7422, and the Tax Court\u2019s ruling would \nhave preclusive effect in that suit. \u201cUnder the doctrine \nof issue preclusion, \u2018a prior judgment forecloses suc-\ncessive litigation of an issue of fact or law actually \nlitigated and resolved in a valid court determination \nessential to the prior judgment.\u2019\u201d Herrera v. Wyoming, \n587 U.S. 329, 342 (2019) (alterations adopted). \u201cThe \nidea is straightforward: Once a court has decided an \nissue, it is \u2018forever settled as between the parties.\u2019\u201d \nB&B Hardware, Inc. v. Hargis Industries, Inc., 575 \nU.S. 138, 147 (2015). That goes for declaratory relief \nissued in an earlier case, too. E.g., 18 Charles A. \nWright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Pro-\ncedure \u00a7 4421 (3d ed. updated June 2024). And the \ndoctrine applies \u201ceven if the issue recurs in the context \n\n31 \n \n \nof a different claim.\u201d Taylor v. Sturgell, 553 U.S. 880, \n892 (2008). \nHere, Zuch\u2019s entitlement to the estimated pay-\nments is an \u201cissue of \u2026 law\u201d that would be \u201cactually \nlitigated and resolved\u201d in the Tax Court proceeding \nand \u201cessential to\u201d the Tax Court\u2019s decision on Zuch\u2019s \nunpaid tax or underlying liability. Herrera, 587 U.S. \nat 342. Thus, the Tax Court\u2019s judgment would be pre-\nclusive in the refund suit Zuch has recently filed in the \nDistrict of New Jersey, and that court likely would or-\nder the government to issue a refund. See, e.g., \nParklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 U.S. 322, 325, 332-\n33 (1979). \nII. The IRS\u2019s counterarguments lack merit. \nA. The Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to review \nwhether Zuch was entitled to the \nprepayments didn\u2019t dissolve once the \nIRS no longer needed the levy. \nThe government claims (Br. 16-21), that the Tax \nCourt has jurisdiction under \u00a7 6330 to review a tax-\npayer\u2019s liability only if the IRS continues threatening \nto levy the taxpayer\u2019s property. In the government\u2019s \nview, \u00a7 6330\u2019s text, history, and \u201cfunction\u201d show that \n\u00a7 6330 focuses only on whether a levy can proceed, and \nthe Tax Court thus lacks jurisdiction when the IRS \ndecides it no longer needs a levy. The government also \nwarns that allowing the Tax Court to review live dis-\nputes about unpaid tax or taxpayer liability when no \nlevy is pending would vastly expand Tax Court juris-\ndiction. Those arguments fail. Section 6330\u2019s text, \nhistory, and remedial purpose, plus time-of-filing \nrules in other contexts, all confirm that the Tax Court \nretains jurisdiction under \u00a7 6330 to review a tax-\npayer\u2019s unpaid tax or underlying liability, even when \n\n32 \n \n \nthe IRS abandons its levy. And the government\u2019s pol-\nicy concern is meritless. \n1. There is no textual basis in \u00a7 6330 for \nthe \ngovernment\u2019s \ncontinuing-levy \nrequirement. \na. The government contends that without a \nthreatened levy, there is nothing for the \u201cunderlying \ntax liability\u201d to \u201cunderlie.\u201d Br. 26. So by implication, \nthe government claims, \u00a7 6330 jurisdiction turns on a \nthreatened levy. Br. 24-27. That argument fails. \nSection 6330(d)(1) makes clear that the Tax Court \nhas jurisdiction in \u00a7 6330 proceedings to review the \nAppeals Office\u2019s determination of the issues raised in \na collection due process hearing. Supra pp. 21-23. It \nsays that \u201cthe Tax Court shall have jurisdiction\u201d to re-\nview the Appeals Office\u2019s \u201cdetermination\u201d\u2014which \nincludes all the issues the Appeals Office was required \nto consider during the hearing, not just whether the \nlevy can proceed. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1); see I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(c)(2), (c)(3)(B). The \u201cunderlying liability\u201d lan-\nguage appears in the provisions of \u00a7 6330 listing the \nmatters a taxpayer may raise at the collection due pro-\ncess hearing. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B). The Appeals \nOffice\u2019s determination thus triggers the Tax Court\u2019s \njurisdiction under \u00a7 6330, and the IRS\u2019s actions after \nthe Appeals Office issues the determination have no \nbearing on that jurisdiction. \nWhat\u2019s more, even assuming the phrase \u201cunderly-\ning tax liability\u201d implies that there must be a proposed \nlevy at the outset of the collection due process hearing \n(and there was here), nothing in \u00a7 6330 conditions the \nTax Court\u2019s exercise of \u00a7 6330 jurisdiction on the IRS\u2019s \ncontinued pursuit of a levy. To the contrary, \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1) refers to the Tax Court\u2019s review of a \n\n33 \n \n \n\u201cdetermination\u201d by the Appeals Office. And even if \n\u00a7 6330 required a pending levy at the outset of Tax \nCourt proceedings, that requirement would be satis-\nfied because there was a threatened levy pending \nwhen Zuch petitioned the Tax Court. Infra pp. 38-39. \nThat makes sense. Zuch continues to be aggrieved by \nthe Appeals Office\u2019s determination upholding the \nIRS\u2019s liability assessment, even though the IRS claims \nit no longer needs the levy. \nViewing Zuch\u2019s challenge as one \u201crelating to the \nunpaid tax\u201d doesn\u2019t mean the Tax Court lost jurisdic-\ntion to review the dispute, either. That\u2019s because the \n$27,682 the IRS claims Zuch owed for the 2010 tax \nyear was \u201cunpaid\u201d when she petitioned the Tax Court \nin 2014. See Pet. App. 11a. \nb. The government also claims that the text of \n\u00a7 6330 is \u201cnarrowly focused\u201d on \u201cwhether the IRS may \ngo forward with its proposed levy,\u201d from the title for \nthe section to the provisions describing the beginning \nof collection due process proceedings and granting the \nTax Court jurisdiction. Br. 17; see Br. 17-20. Not so. \nFor starters, the title of a provision is \u201cnot meant \nto take the place of the detailed provisions of the text\u201d; \nnor is it \u201cnecessarily designed to be a reference guide \nor a synopsis.\u201d Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. \nBaltimore & Ohio Railroad Co., 331 U.S. 519, 528 \n(1947). What\u2019s more, even though a taxpayer can ini-\ntiate collection due process proceedings with the \nAppeals Office when the IRS seeks to levy, see I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(a)(1), the provisions that authorize the Tax \nCourt to review a taxpayer\u2019s liability challenge\u2014\n\u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B) and (d)(1)\u2014do not \u201cfocus[] on\u201d a levy. \nSection 6330(c)(2)(B), for instance, allows taxpayers in \nsome situations to \u201craise at the hearing challenges to \n\n34 \n \n \nthe existence or amount of the underlying tax liabil-\nity.\u201d And \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A) differentiates \u201crelevant \nissue[s] relating to the unpaid tax\u201d from issues about \n\u201cthe proposed levy.\u201d Section 6330(d)(1), moreover, \nstates that the taxpayer may \u201cpetition the Tax Court \nfor review of such determination (and the Tax Court \nshall have jurisdiction with respect to such matter).\u201d \nNo continuing-levy requirement there. \nc. Next, the government says that \u00a7 6330(d)(1)\u2019s \nreference to the Appeals Office\u2019s \u201cdetermination\u201d im-\nplies that Tax Court jurisdiction hinges on a \nthreatened levy because the \u201cdetermination\u201d is about \nonly \u201cwhether the levy may go forward.\u201d Br. 19-20. \nThat\u2019s wrong, too. Section 6330(d)(1) authorizes the \nTax Court to review that \u201cdetermination,\u201d which nec-\nessarily involves reviewing the Appeals Office\u2019s \nresolution of each issue raised at the collection due \nprocess hearing. Supra pp. 21-23. That includes, \nwhere relevant, the taxpayer\u2019s unpaid tax or underly-\ning liability, see I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2), (c)(3)(B)\u2014\ndeterminations, as this very case shows, with signifi-\ncance beyond whether a levy may proceed. Those \nrulings determine who keeps the money both parties \nclaim is legally theirs. And as the government admits \n(Br. 19-20), the Tax Court\u2019s resolution of those issues \nis part and parcel of the determination. Nothing in \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1) conditions the Tax Court\u2019s review of that \ndetermination\u2014and all the issues it resolves\u2014on a \ncontinuing levy. \nd. The government\u2019s atextual continuing-levy re-\nquirement fails for another reason: \u201cthe presumption \nfavoring judicial review of administrative action,\u201d \nGuerrero-Lasprilla, 589 U.S. at 229, weighs in favor of \nTax Court jurisdiction. The \u201cstrong presumption\u201d of \njudicial review directs that \u201cwhen a statutory \n\n35 \n \n \nprovision \u2018is reasonably susceptible to divergent inter-\npretation,\u2019\u201d courts must \u201cadopt the reading that \naccords with traditional understandings and basic \nprinciples: that executive determinations generally \nare subject to judicial review.\u201d Id. And where applica-\nble, the \u201cpresumption can only be overcome by \u2018clear \nand convincing evidence\u2019 of congressional intent to \npreclude judicial review.\u201d Id. Those principles also \nalign with this Court\u2019s recent recognition in the \u00a7 6330 \ncontext that jurisdictional requirements must be \n\u201cclearly state[d].\u201d Boechler, 596 U.S. at 203. \nHere, \u00a7 6330 is susceptible to one interpretation: \nthe Tax Court retains jurisdiction to review a deter-\nmination even if the IRS says it no longer needs the \nlevy. Supra pp. 21-26. Section 6330(d)(1) doesn\u2019t men-\ntion levies, much less contain a clear continuing-levy \nrequirement. But even if another reasonable interpre-\ntation were possible, it is far from clear that Congress \nintended to insulate the Appeals Office\u2019s unpaid tax \nand liability determinations when the IRS stops pur-\nsuing a levy. See Pet. Br. 34. \nThe presumption doesn\u2019t become irrelevant here \njust because Zuch can file a refund suit and obtain ju-\ndicial review of her entitlement to the estimated \npayments that way, as the government contends (id.). \nThe \u201cadministrative action\u201d at issue here is the Ap-\npeals Office\u2019s determination. Guerrero-Lasprilla, 589 \nU.S. at 229. So the question is whether that determi-\nnation is reviewable in the Tax Court under \u00a7 6330\u2014\nnot whether Zuch may obtain review of another ac-\ntion, in a different court, and under a different Code \nprovision. The presumption applies in answering the \nformer question. And the answer is that the Tax Court \nretains jurisdiction. \n\n36 \n \n \n2. The \ngovernment \nmisconstrues \n\u00a7 6330\u2019s history and downplays its \nremedial \npurpose, \nwhich \nboth \nsupport \nthe \nTax \nCourt\u2019s \n\u00a7 6330 \njurisdiction to review unpaid tax and \nliability disputes even if the IRS no \nlonger pursues the levy. \nThe government claims (Br. 22-23) that because \nCongress added \u00a7 6330 in 1998 to allow taxpayers to \nchallenge levies before the IRS seized their property, \nthat somehow shows that the Tax Court has jurisdic-\ntion only if a levy is pending. But that argument \ncannot trump plain text. And in any event, \u00a7 6330\u2019s \nhistory and purpose confirm that Congress wanted \nthe Tax Court to retain jurisdiction over a live unpaid \ntax or liability dispute even if the IRS no longer needs \na levy. \nCongress enacted \u00a7 6330 to protect taxpayers from \nthe IRS\u2019s abusive collection practices and to rein in the \nIRS\u2019s unchecked power to act as \u201cjudge, jury, and exe-\ncutioner, answerable to none.\u201d Hearings Before the \nCommittee on Finance at 56, 82; see supra pp. 9-10. \nAnd in designing \u00a7 6330\u2019s scheme, Congress sought to \n\u201censure that all taxpayers have due process and that \nthe IRS does not abusively use its liens-and-seizure \nauthority.\u201d 143 Cong. Rec. S12231 (statement of Sen. \nRoth). Indeed, the point of \u00a7 6330 proceedings is to \u201cin-\ncrease fairness to taxpayers\u201d before the IRS deprives \nthem of their property. S. Rep. No. 105-174, at 67; ac-\ncord Katz v. Commissioner, 115 T.C. 329, 333 n.8 \n(2000) (explaining that Congress enacted \u00a7 6330 \u201cto \nprovide new protections for taxpayers\u201d). \nSection 6330 did just that. It gave taxpayers a \nchance to challenge their liability before paying it \n\n37 \n \n \nwhen the taxpayer did not already have an oppor-\ntunity to challenge the liability, and ensured \ntaxpayers may always raise \u201cany relevant issue relat-\ning to the unpaid tax.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2). Section \n6330 thus gave taxpayers an opportunity for IRS Ap-\npeals to reach a \u201cdetermination\u201d on their unpaid tax \nor liability, and granted taxpayers the right \u201cto peti-\ntion the Tax Court to contest the Appeals [Office\u2019s] \ndecision,\u201d 144 Cong. Rec. S4494 (statement of Sen. \nHatch). Put simply, history shows that Congress did \nnot intend to enable the IRS to unilaterally deprive \nthe Tax Court of jurisdiction to review unpaid tax or \nliability disputes by finding another way to take the \ntaxpayer\u2019s money and then claiming it no longer seeks \nthe levy. And given \u00a7 6330\u2019s history, the Court should \nconstrue the statute \u201cbroadly to effectuate its pur-\nposes.\u201d Tcherepnin v. Knight, 389 U.S. 332, 336 (1967); \nsee Piedmont & Northern Railway. v. Interstate Com-\nmerce Commission, 286 U.S. 299, 311 (1932). \n3. Royal \nCanin \ndoesn\u2019t \nhelp \nthe \ngovernment. \nPointing to this Court\u2019s decision in Royal Canin, \nthe government argues that \u00a7 6330 contains a contin-\nuing-levy requirement because the IRS \u201calter[s]\u201d \n\u201c[t]he fundamental basis\u201d of the suit when it decides \nto no longer seek the levy. Br. 29-31. That argument \nfails. \nIn Royal Canin, the Court held that, if a plaintiff \namends her complaint to \u201celiminate[] the federal-law \nclaims that enabled removal, leaving only state-law \nclaims behind, the court\u2019s power to decide the dispute \ndissolves.\u201d 604 U.S. at 30. That makes sense, given the \nbasic idea that \u201c[i]f a plaintiff amends her complaint, \nthe new pleading \u2018supersedes\u2019 the old one.\u201d Id. at 35 \n\n38 \n \n \n(citing 6 Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice \nand Procedure \u00a7 1476 (3d ed. 2010)). And in Royal \nCanin, the plaintiff altered the basis for the federal \ncourt\u2019s federal question jurisdiction by amending her \ncomplaint to withdraw her federal claims.  \nNone of those principles shows that the Tax Court \nlost jurisdiction under \u00a7 6330 to review the Appeals \nOffice\u2019s determination when the IRS stopped pursuing \nthe levy. The basis of the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction un-\nder \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1) \nis \nthe \nAppeals \nOffice\u2019s \ndetermination\u2014not the proposed levy. The IRS did \nnot change the basis of the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction by \ndropping the levy, because once the Appeals Office is-\nsues a \u201cdetermination,\u201d the Tax Court has jurisdiction \nto review it. See I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1) (\u201cthe Tax Court \nshall have jurisdiction\u201d to \u201creview\u201d the \u201cdetermina-\ntion\u201d). And unlike the plaintiff in Royal Canin, Zuch \ndidn\u2019t file an amended pleading changing the basis of \nthe Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction. When Zuch filed her Tax \nCourt petition, she challenged the Appeals Office\u2019s de-\ntermination that she was not entitled to the estimated \npayments. That\u2019s still her challenge today, and the \nIRS\u2019s decision to stop pursuing the levy is irrelevant.  \nBut even assuming the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction \nunder \u00a7 6330 was somehow contingent on a levy, time-\nof-filing rules show that any levy requirement was \nmet because there was a pending levy when Zuch pe-\ntitioned the Tax Court. Time-of-filing rules generally \nprovide that jurisdiction \u201cdepends upon the state of \nthings at the time\u201d the plaintiff brings the action, \nGrupo Dataflux v. Atlas Global Group, L.P., 541 U.S. \n567, 570 (2004); see, e.g., Conolly v. Taylor, 27 U.S. (2 \nPet.) 556, 565 (1829)\u2014here, when the taxpayer peti-\ntions the Tax Court. So, if \u00a7 6330 did require a pending \nlevy, that levy requirement would be assessed at the \n\n39 \n \n \ntime the taxpayer files her Tax Court petition. And \nhere, there was a pending levy when Zuch petitioned \nthe Tax Court. Pet. App. 11a, 13a. The IRS\u2019s decision \nto stop pursuing the levy thus does not destroy the Tax \nCourt\u2019s jurisdiction to review the Appeals Office\u2019s de-\ntermination, even if \u00a7 6330 contains a levy-based \njurisdictional requirement. \n4. The government\u2019s policy argument is \nmeritless. \nThe government claims that, if it cannot deprive \nthe Tax Court of jurisdiction to review a liability chal-\nlenge by no longer seeking the levy, \u00a7 6330 will turn \ninto a \u201cgeneral forum for considering challenges to tax \nliability.\u201d Br. 24. That argument lacks merit. \nThere\u2019s no risk of the Tax Court wading into gen-\neral liability determinations in \u00a7 6330 proceedings. \nSection 6330 specifies the issues taxpayers may raise \nin \ncollection \ndue \nprocess \nhearings. \nI.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A). And only taxpayers who did not have \nan earlier opportunity to challenge their assessed lia-\nbility can challenge that claimed liability in collection \ndue process proceedings. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B). The \nTax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to review the taxpayer\u2019s lia-\nbility (or issue relating to the unpaid tax), in turn, is \ntied to the Appeals Office\u2019s liability determination. \nI.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). The sky isn\u2019t falling, and the gov-\nernment hasn\u2019t pointed to any \u00a7 6330 cases pending \nbefore the Appeals Office or the Tax Court that would \nsuggest otherwise. \nWhat\u2019s more, the question presented in this case \narises rarely, and when it does, it\u2019s only as a result of \n\u201cthe IRS\u2019s own recalcitrance.\u201d Boechler, 596 U.S. at \n207. The question arises only when the IRS initiates a \nlevy, but during \u00a7 6330 proceedings, finds a way to \n\n40 \n \n \ntake the taxpayer\u2019s money another way, and drops the \nlevy during the Tax Court\u2019s review. But there\u2019s no rea-\nson to think the issue comes up with any frequency. \nB. The Tax Court\u2019s authority is not limited \nto approving or rejecting a proposed \nlevy, but includes the power to issue \nbinding judgments. \nThe government argues that the Tax Court \ndoesn\u2019t have the power to declare Zuch\u2019s entitlement \nto the estimated payments. In the government\u2019s view, \n\u00a7 6330 doesn\u2019t authorize that relief, the DJA\u2019s prohi-\nbition on declaratory relief in most tax cases bars \nbinding relief here, and \u00a7 6330 is a \u201climited mecha-\nnism\u201d for either allowing or disallowing a levy. Br. 23-\n24, 27-29. Those arguments are meritless. \nFirst, \u00a7 6330(d)(1) authorizes the Tax Court to de-\ntermine whether the estimated payments should have \ncovered the amount the IRS assessed for the 2010 tax \nyear, no matter whether there is a pending levy. \nThat\u2019s because the Tax Court \u201cshall have jurisdiction\u201d \nto \u201creview\u201d the Appeals Office\u2019s determination of the \ntaxpayer\u2019s underlying liability or issues relating to \nher unpaid tax. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B), (d)(1). And that \nmeans the Tax Court can issue a ruling resolving \nZuch\u2019s liability or issues relating to the unpaid tax. \nThe IRS is expected to abide by that ruling, and in-\ndeed, that ruling will have preclusive effect. Supra \npp. 28-31. \nSecond, \u00a7 6330(e)(1) confirms that the Tax Court \ncan issue its ruling in the form of declaratory relief. \nThat provision authorizes injunctive relief in \u00a7 6330 \nproceedings, which necessarily means it also author-\nizes declaratory relief. That\u2019s because an injunction \nnecessarily rests on a declaration. Indeed, an \n\n41 \n \n \ninjunction prohibiting an act incorporates \u201ca judicial \ndeclaration that [the act] is illegal,\u201d Pet. App. 36a. \nAnd as this Court has recognized, declaratory relief is \na \u201cmilder\u201d alternative to an injunction. Steffel v. \nThompson, 415 U.S. 452, 466-67 (1974). Thus, the Tax \nCourt\u2019s authority to issue an injunction under \n\u00a7 6330(e)(1) includes the authority to issue declara-\ntory relief. \nResisting that conclusion, the government asserts \nthat \u00a7 6330(e)(1) can\u2019t authorize declaratory relief be-\ncause it limits injunctive authority to \u201ca specific \ncollection action.\u201d Br. 28-29. Not so. Section 6330(e)(1) \nauthorizes the Tax Court to enjoin \u201cany action or pro-\nceeding\u201d if: (1) \u201ca timely appeal has been filed under \nsubsection (d)(1),\u201d and (2) the injunction is \u201cin respect \nof the unpaid tax or proposed levy to which the deter-\nmination being appealed relates.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(e)(1); \nsee I.R.C. \u00a7 7421(a). And if the Tax Court can issue an \ninjunction \u201cin respect of the unpaid tax or proposed \nlevy,\u201d it can also decide the taxpayer\u2019s liability that \ngave rise to both the unpaid tax and the proposed levy.  \nThird, the DJA doesn\u2019t withdraw the Tax Court\u2019s \nauthority to issue declaratory relief. That statute au-\nthorizes federal courts to \u201cdeclare the rights and other \nlegal relations of any interested party seeking such \ndeclaration,\u201d \u201cexcept with respect to Federal taxes.\u201d 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2201(a). But courts have uniformly held that \nthe DJA must be read together with the Tax Code and \nthe AIA, I.R.C. \u00a7 7421(a). And that means the DJA \ndoes not prohibit declaratory relief where those other \nprovisions permit injunctions. E.g., Cohen v. United \nStates, 650 F.3d 717, 727-28 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (en banc); \nCIC Services, LLC v. Internal Revenue Service, 925 \nF.3d 247, 250 n.3 (6th Cir. 2019), rev\u2019d on other \ngrounds 593 U.S. 209 (2021); see Bob Jones University \n\n42 \n \n \nv. Simon, 416 U.S. 725, 732 n.7 (1974). Both the plain \ntext of \u00a7 6330(d)(1) and (e)(1) and the AIA, I.R.C. \n\u00a7 7421(a), authorize injunctions in \u00a7 6330 proceed-\nings, so declaratory relief is authorized as well. \nFinally, as explained (at 32-35), \u00a7 6330 isn\u2019t just \nabout whether a levy can proceed or not, so the Tax \nCourt\u2019s authority is not limited to deciding whether or \nnot a levy can proceed, either. Instead, Congress en-\nacted \u00a7 6330 to create a meaningful exception to what \nthe government says is the Tax Code\u2019s historical \u201cpay \nnow, dispute later\u201d framework. See Pet. Br. 2. It did so \nby allowing taxpayers to challenge the unpaid tax and \ntheir liability before they decide to pay or the IRS lev-\nies their property. And as \u00a7 6330\u2019s history confirms, \nthe Tax Court retains jurisdiction under \u00a7 6330 to re-\nview the Appeals Office\u2019s determination of her unpaid \ntax or tax liability, so it can issue binding relief resolv-\ning those issues, too. Supra pp. 23-24, 36-37. \nC. The government\u2019s claim that the parties \nlack a legally cognizable interest in the \ncase once the IRS decides not to move \nforward with the levy is incorrect. \nUnable to show that its actions deprived the Tax \nCourt of \u00a7 6330 jurisdiction, the IRS next contends \n(Br. 21), that the case is moot because once the IRS \ndecides it doesn\u2019t need a levy, the parties lack a legally \ncognizable interest. That is so, the IRS says, because \neven if \u201cthe IRS has made an error or continues to owe \n[the taxpayer] money,\u201d there\u2019s no threatened levy, and \nthe levy is \u201cthe issue that prompted\u201d the collection due \nprocess hearing. Id. That argument fails. \nThe question isn\u2019t whether \u201cthe issue that \nprompted\u201d a collection due process hearing is live. Ra-\nther, \u201c[a]s long as the parties have a concrete interest, \n\n43 \n \n \nhowever small, in the outcome of the litigation,\u201d the \ncase is not moot. Campbell-Ewald Co., 577 U.S. at \n161. And as explained, Zuch has a concrete interest in \nthe outcome of the litigation because the Tax Court \ncan adjudicate her unpaid tax or underlying liability \nby determining her right to the estimated payments, \nand therefore to a refund. Accord Saltzman & Book, \nsupra, \u00a7 14B.16[4][a]. That ruling would also be pre-\nclusive in the refund action Zuch has brought in the \nDistrict of New Jersey under I.R.C. \u00a7 7422. The IRS \nhas a concrete interest, too: if the Tax Court decides \nthat Zuch is not entitled to the estimated payments, \nthe IRS keeps her money. It is thus not \u201cimpossible for \na court to grant any effectual relief what[so]ever\u201d to \nwhomever prevails. Chafin v. Chafin, 568 U.S. 165, \n172 (2013). \nD. Whether Zuch\u2019s challenge is a dispute \nabout an unpaid tax or underlying \nliability is immaterial. \nIn a footnote, the government claims that Zuch\u2019s \nchallenge presents \u201can issue relating to [her] unpaid \ntax,\u201d rather than her tax liability. Br. 25 n.3. But, as \nthe government concedes, whether Zuch\u2019s challenge is \nabout an unpaid tax or underlying liability is immate-\nrial. Id. (\u201cThe Court need not \u2026 decide this dispute to \nresolve the question presented.\u201d). The difference \ndoesn\u2019t matter because, as explained (at 26-27), even \nif Zuch\u2019s challenge is one related to an \u201cunpaid tax,\u201d \nthe Tax Court still had jurisdiction. That\u2019s because \nZuch\u2019s challenge to her unpaid tax would still have \nbeen part of the Appeals Office\u2019s \u201cdetermination\u201d that \nwas reviewable by the Tax Court. Id. \nIn any event, the Appeals Office itself considered \nZuch to be challenging her underlying tax liability. \n\n44 \n \n \nPet. App. 48a, 66a. Indeed, she disputed whether she \nowed \u201cthe amounts that the Commissioner assessed \nfor [the 2010] tax period,\u201d Jeffers, 992 F.3d at 653 n.4, \nbecause she argued the estimated payments should \nhave been applied to her, see Peoplease, 2025 WL \n429626, at *2. Supra p. 26. And, in the IRS\u2019s own view, \n\u201cunpaid tax\u201d is just the unpaid portion of the \u201cunder-\nlying tax liability\u201d anyway.
