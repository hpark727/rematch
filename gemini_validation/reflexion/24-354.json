    "facts_of_the_case": "The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was established in 1934 to regulate interstate communications and ensure widespread access to telecommunications services. To further this mission, Congress in 1996 instructed the FCC to establish and maintain a universal service fund, requiring telecommunications carriers to contribute quarterly based on their revenues. The FCC partners with the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC), a private entity, to manage this process\u2014USAC calculates projected demand and contribution factors using FCC formulas, submits these proposals to the FCC for approval, and then uses the approved figures to determine individual contribution amounts.\n\nConsumers\u2019 Research challenged the constitutionality of the 1996 Telecommunications Act\u2019s universal service requirements and the FCC\u2019s implementation of those requirements. Their primary arguments were twofold: first, that Congress unconstitutionally delegated its legislative power to the FCC through the universal service provisions, and second, that the FCC improperly delegated its authority to a private entity (USAC) to manage the universal service fund.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit denied the petition, finding no constitutional violations in either delegation. The Court determined that Congress provided sufficient guidance (an \u201cintelligible principle\u201d) to the FCC in the statute, and that the FCC maintained adequate control and oversight over USAC\u2019s activities in managing the universal service fund, preventing any improper delegation of government authority to a private entity.",

The information gained will be critical for mapping the arguments onto the known jurisprudence of the Court. Therefore, the Task EIG is very high. For the design, this action validates a core strategic principle: always start with the foundational filings.

The \nCommission has appointed a private company as the \nprograms\u2019 Administrator, authorizing that company to \nperform administrative tasks such as sending out bills, \ncollecting contributions, and disbursing funds to bene-\nficiaries.  The questions presented are as follows:  \n1. Whether Congress violated the nondelegation \ndoctrine by authorizing the Commission to determine, \nwithin the limits set forth in Section 254, the amount \nthat providers must contribute to the Fund.  \n2. Whether the Commission violated the nondelega-\ntion doctrine by using the Administrator\u2019s financial pro-\njections in computing universal service contribution \nrates.  \n3. Whether the combination of Congress\u2019s conferral \nof authority on the Commission and the Commission\u2019s \ndelegation of administrative responsibilities to the Ad-\nministrator violates the nondelegation doctrine. \n \n \n\n(II) \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nThe following parties are petitioners here and were \nrespondents below:   the Federal Communications Com-\nmission and the United States of America.   \nThe following parties are respondents here and were \npetitioners below:  Consumers\u2019 Research; Cause Based \nCommerce, Inc.; Joseph Bayly; Suzanne Bettac; Ker-\nsten Conway; Lynn Gibbs; Paul Gibbs; Kwang Ja \nKerby; Tom Kirby; Robert Kull; Deanna Roth; Jeremy \nRoth; and Rhonda Thomas.  \nThe following parties were intervenors below: Ben-\nton Institute for Broadband and Society; Center for Me-\ndia Justice, d/b/a MediaJustice; Competitive Carriers \nAssociation; National Digital Inclusion Alliance; Na-\ntional Telecommunications Cooperative Association, \nd/b/a NTCA\u2014The Rural Broadband Association; \nSchools, Health and Libraries Broadband Coalition; \nand U.S. Telecom\u2014The Broadband Association.  \nRELATED PROCEEDING \nUnited States Court of Appeals (5th Cir.): \nConsumers\u2019 Research v.

The opinion \nof the court of appeals panel (App., infra, 125a-141a) is \nreported at 63 F.4th 441.  \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the en banc court of appeals was en-\ntered on July 24, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court is \ninvoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent statutory provisions are reproduced in the \nappendix.  App., infra, 162a-187a. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Universal Service Fund \n1. In the Communications Act of 1934 (Act), 47 \nU.S.C. 151 et seq., Congress established the Federal \nCommunications Commission (FCC or Commission).  \nOne of the Act\u2019s fundamental goals, and one of the \nFCC\u2019s core missions, is promoting universal service\u2014\ni.e., ensuring the availability of affordable and reliable \ntelecommunications services throughout the United \nStates.  See AT&T, Inc. v. FCC, 886 F.3d 1236, 1241 \n(D.C. Cir. 2018).  Congress referenced that mission in \nthe statutory text, directing the agency to \u201cmake avail-\nable, so far as possible, to all the people of the United \nStates,  * * *  a rapid, efficient, Nation-wide, and world-\nwide wire and radio communication service with ade-\nquate facilities at reasonable charges.\u201d  47 U.S.C. 151.  \nFor the first half-century of its existence, the FCC \nachieved universal service primarily by regulating \nrates.  See Verizon Communications Inc. v. FCC, 535 \nU.S. 467, 480 (2002).  For example, the Commission re-\nquired telephone monopolies to charge below-cost rates \nin rural areas, while allowing them to charge above-cost \nrates in cities.  See ibid.  Through that approach, urban \ncustomers effectively subsidized the provision of tele-\nphone service to rural customers.  See ibid.  \nIn 1996, Congress overhauled the Act in order to \npromote competition and eliminate monopolies in the \ntelecommunications industry.  See Telecommunications \nAct of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-104, 110 Stat. 56.  As part \nof those reforms, Congress established a new frame-\nwork for achieving universal service.  See 47 U.S.C. 254.  \n\n3 \n \nThe amended Act directs the FCC to establish a set of \nprograms known collectively as the Universal Service \nFund (Fund).  See 47 U.S.C. 254(a).  It requires carriers \nthat provide interstate telecommunications services to \n\u201ccontribute\u201d to the Fund \u201con an equitable and nondis-\ncriminatory basis.\u201d  47 U.S.C. 254(d).  The Commission \nmust use the money in the Fund to subsidize universal \nservice.  See 47 U.S.C. 254(e).   \nThe Act\u2019s provisions guide and limit the FCC\u2019s exer-\ncise of that authority.  The Act requires the Commission \nto \u201cbase policies for the preservation and advancement \nof universal service\u201d on a series of specific \u201cprinciples\u201d \n\u2014for example, the principle that consumers in rural ar-\neas \u201cshould have access to telecommunications and in-\nformation services  * * *  that are reasonably compara-\nble to those services provided in urban areas.\u201d  47 \nU.S.C. 254(b)(3); see 47 U.S.C. 254(b).  The Act also re-\nquires the Commission, when deciding whether to sub-\nsidize a service, to consider certain factors\u2014for exam-\nple, the extent to which the service in question is \u201ces-\nsential to education, public health, or public safety.\u201d  47 \nU.S.C. 254(c)(1)(A); see 47 U.S.C. 254(c)(1).  \nIn accordance with the Act, the Commission has es-\ntablished four universal service programs, which assist \n(1) deployment in remote areas, (2) low-income consum-\ners, (3) schools and libraries, and (4) rural healthcare \nproviders.  See 47 C.F.R. 54.302-54.322, 54.400-54.424, \n54.500-54.523, 54.600-54.633, 54.801-54.1524.  All four \nprograms subsidize telephone and broadband services, \nsee 47 C.F.R. 54.101, and the program for schools and \nlibraries subsidizes internal connections as well, see 47 \nC.F.R. 54.502(a).   \n2. In 1997, the FCC directed the creation of the Uni-\nversal Service Administrative Company (Company) to \n\n4 \n \nhelp it administer the Fund.  See In re Changes to the \nBoard of Directors of the National Exchange Carrier \nAss\u2019n, Inc., 12 FCC Rcd 18,400, 18,418-18,419 (1997).  \nThe Company is a private, not-for-profit corporation \nchartered in Delaware.  See App., infra, 59a. \nAlthough the Company is a private body, it remains \nsubject to the Commission\u2019s oversight and control.  Its \nsole stockholder, an association of carriers, must \u201cact in \ncompliance with the [FCC\u2019s] Rules and Orders when ex-\nercising its stockholder duties and powers.\u201d  Amended \nand Restated By-Laws of Universal Service Adminis-\ntrative Company, Art. I, \u00b6 1 (rev. Jan. 26, 2024).  FCC \nrules identify the groups represented on the Company\u2019s \nBoard of Directors (e.g., consumers, carriers, and recip-\nients of universal service funding), and the FCC Chair \nselects directors after reviewing nominations from \nthose groups.  See 47 C.F.R. 54.703(b).  The Company \nalso must obtain the Commission\u2019s approval of its \nbudget.  See 47 C.F.R. 54.715(c).  \nThe FCC has \u201cappointed\u201d the Company as the \nFund\u2019s \u201cpermanent Administrator.\u201d  47 C.F.R. 54.701(a).  \nIn that role, the Company provides financial projections \nthat the FCC uses each quarter in computing the \namounts of universal service contributions.  See 47 \nC.F.R. 54.709.  The Administrator also sends out bills \nand collects contributions.  See 47 C.F.R. 54.702(b).  Fi-\nnally, the Administrator disburses money to program \nbeneficiaries in accordance with FCC rules.  See ibid.  \nAlthough the Administrator performs administra-\ntive tasks on the FCC\u2019s behalf, it exercises no independ-\nent regulatory power.  It \u201cmay not make policy, inter-\npret unclear provisions of the statute or rules, or inter-\npret the intent of Congress.\u201d  47 C.F.R. 54.702(c).  It \nmust comply with the Commission\u2019s rules, see 47 C.F.R. \n\n5 \n \n54.701-54.717, and any party that is aggrieved by its de-\ncisions may request de novo review by the Commission, \nsee 47 C.F.R. 54.719-54.725. \n3. The FCC\u2019s rules prescribe a process for compu-\nting each carrier\u2019s quarterly contribution to the Fund.  \nSee 47 C.F.R. 54.709.  At least 60 days before the begin-\nning of each quarter, the Administrator must submit to \nthe Commission its projections of the expenses (bene-\nfits plus administrative overhead) that the four univer-\nsal service programs will incur, along with \u201cthe basis for \nthose projections.\u201d  47 C.F.R. 54.709(a)(3).  And at least \n30 days before the beginning of each quarter, the Ad-\nministrator must submit a projection of the total reve-\nnues that telecommunications carriers will earn from \ninterstate and international telecommunications ser-\nvices, based on financial information provided by those \ncarriers.  See ibid. \nThe FCC uses those projections to calculate a \u201ccon-\ntribution factor\u201d\u2014i.e., a number that is based on the ra-\ntio of the projected expenses to the projected revenues.  \n47 C.F.R. 54.709(a)(2).  The Commission then announces \nthe projections and proposed contribution factor to the \npublic.  See 47 C.F.R. 54.709(a)(3).  The FCC may revise \nthe projections (and thus the contribution factor) and \nmay set them \u201cat amounts that the Commission deter-\nmines will serve the public interest.\u201d  Ibid.  If the Com-\nmission takes no action within 14 days after the an-\nnouncement, however, the projections and contribution \nfactor are \u201cdeemed approved.\u201d  Ibid. \nOnce the FCC approves the contribution factor, the \nAdministrator calculates each carrier\u2019s contribution by \napplying the factor to that carrier\u2019s \u201ccontribution base\u201d \n(generally, the carrier\u2019s interstate and international tel-\necommunications revenues).  47 C.F.R. 54.709(a)(3).  \n\n6 \n \nFor example, if the contribution factor is 25%, each car-\nrier would owe 25% of its interstate and international \ntelecommunications revenues.  Carriers may pass the \ncost of their contributions on to customers.  See 47 \nC.F.R. 54.712(a). \nB. Proceedings Below \n1. In November 2021, the Administrator submitted \nits projections of expenses and revenues for the first \nquarter of 2022.  See App., infra, 150a-159a.  Based on \nthose projections, the Commission proposed a contribu-\ntion factor of 25.2%.  See id. at 141a-149a.   \nRespondents\u2014a nonprofit organization, a carrier, \nand a group of consumers\u2014filed comments requesting \nthat the FCC set the contribution factor at 0% instead.  \nSee Gov\u2019t C.A. Br. 17.  Respondents did not object to \nthe Administrator\u2019s projections or to the Commission\u2019s \ncomputation of the contribution factor based on those \nprojections.  Respondents instead argued that the uni-\nversal service program was itself unlawful.  See App., \ninfra, 11a.  They contended that Congress had uncon-\nstitutionally delegated legislative power to the FCC and \nthat the Commission had unconstitutionally redelegated \npower to the Administrator.  See ibid.   \nThe Commission took no further action within 14 \ndays after publishing the proposed contribution factor.  \nSee App., infra, 11a.  As a result, the factor was deemed \napproved.  See ibid.  \n2. Respondents filed a petition for review in the \nFifth Circuit.  See App., infra, 11a.  A unanimous panel \ndenied the petition.  See id. at 125a-140a.  \nThe panel first rejected the FCC\u2019s argument that the \npetition for review was untimely because \u201cany challenge \nto \u00a7 254 should have come when Congress originally en-\nacted it.\u201d  App., infra, 128a.  The panel reasoned that \n\n7 \n \nthe Commission had \u201creapplied\u201d Section 254 when it \nadopted the contribution factor for the first quarter of \n2022 and that respondents therefore could properly \nraise their constitutional claim as part of their challenge \nto that agency action.  Id. at 129a.  \nOn the merits, the panel rejected respondents\u2019 claim \nthat Congress in enacting Section 254 had unconstitu-\ntionally delegated legislative power to the FCC.  See \nApp., infra, 132a-137a.  The panel determined that Sec-\ntion 254 sets forth \u201cnumerous intelligible principles\u201d \nthat constrain the FCC\u2019s exercise of its authority.  Id. \nat 137a.  The panel also rejected respondents\u2019 claim that \nthe Commission had unconstitutionally delegated gov-\nernmental power to the Company.  See id. at 137a-140a.  \nThe panel emphasized that the Company lacks inde-\npendent regulatory authority and functions \u201csubordi-\nnate[ly]\u201d to the Commission.  Id. at 140a.  \n3. The court of appeals granted respondents\u2019 peti-\ntion for rehearing en banc.  See App., infra, 160a-161a.  \nThe en banc court granted respondents\u2019 petition for re-\nview by a vote of 9-7.  See id. at 1a-118a.  \nThe en banc court held that no procedural obstacle \nprevented it from reaching the merits of the petition for \nreview.  See App., infra, 11a-18a.  The court observed \nthat respondents\u2019 challenge to the specific FCC action \nat issue here\u2014i.e., the contribution factor that the Com-\nmission had established for the first quarter of 2022\u2014\n\u201cmight be moot\u201d because sovereign immunity might \npreclude recovery of money already paid into the Uni-\nversal Service Fund.  Id. at 13a.  The court held, how-\never, that the case \u201cis nonetheless justiciable because it \nis capable of repetition yet eva\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

The \nCommission has appointed a private company as the \nprograms\u2019 Administrator, authorizing that company to \nperform administrative tasks such as sending out bills, \ncollecting contributions, and disbursing funds to bene-\nficiaries.  The questions presented are as follows:  \n1. Whether Congress violated the nondelegation \ndoctrine by authorizing the Commission to determine, \nwithin the limits set forth in Section 254, the amount \nthat providers must contribute to the Fund.  \n2. Whether the Commission violated the nondelega-\ntion doctrine by using the Administrator\u2019s financial pro-\njections in computing universal service contribution \nrates.  \n3. Whether the combination of Congress\u2019s conferral \nof authority on the Commission and the Commission\u2019s \ndelegation of administrative responsibilities to the Ad-\nministrator violates the nondelegation doctrine. \n \n \n\n(II) \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nThe following parties are petitioners here and were \nrespondents below:   the Federal Communications Com-\nmission and the United States of America.   \nThe following parties are respondents here and were \npetitioners below:  Consumers\u2019 Research; Cause Based \nCommerce, Inc.; Joseph Bayly; Suzanne Bettac; Ker-\nsten Conway; Lynn Gibbs; Paul Gibbs; Kwang Ja \nKerby; Tom Kirby; Robert Kull; Deanna Roth; Jeremy \nRoth; and Rhonda Thomas.  \nThe following parties were intervenors below: Ben-\nton Institute for Broadband and Society; Center for Me-\ndia Justice, d/b/a MediaJustice; Competitive Carriers \nAssociation; National Digital Inclusion Alliance; Na-\ntional Telecommunications Cooperative Association, \nd/b/a NTCA\u2014The Rural Broadband Association; \nSchools, Health and Libraries Broadband Coalition; \nand U.S. Telecom\u2014The Broadband Association.  \nRELATED PROCEEDING \nUnited States Court of Appeals (5th Cir.): \nConsumers\u2019 Research v.

The opinion \nof the court of appeals panel (App., infra, 125a-141a) is \nreported at 63 F.4th 441.  \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the en banc court of appeals was en-\ntered on July 24, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court is \ninvoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent statutory provisions are reproduced in the \nappendix.  App., infra, 162a-187a. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Universal Service Fund \n1. In the Communications Act of 1934 (Act), 47 \nU.S.C. 151 et seq., Congress established the Federal \nCommunications Commission (FCC or Commission).  \nOne of the Act\u2019s fundamental goals, and one of the \nFCC\u2019s core missions, is promoting universal service\u2014\ni.e., ensuring the availability of affordable and reliable \ntelecommunications services throughout the United \nStates.  See AT&T, Inc. v. FCC, 886 F.3d 1236, 1241 \n(D.C. Cir. 2018).  Congress referenced that mission in \nthe statutory text, directing the agency to \u201cmake avail-\nable, so far as possible, to all the people of the United \nStates,  * * *  a rapid, efficient, Nation-wide, and world-\nwide wire and radio communication service with ade-\nquate facilities at reasonable charges.\u201d  47 U.S.C. 151.  \nFor the first half-century of its existence, the FCC \nachieved universal service primarily by regulating \nrates.  See Verizon Communications Inc. v. FCC, 535 \nU.S. 467, 480 (2002).  For example, the Commission re-\nquired telephone monopolies to charge below-cost rates \nin rural areas, while allowing them to charge above-cost \nrates in cities.  See ibid.  Through that approach, urban \ncustomers effectively subsidized the provision of tele-\nphone service to rural customers.  See ibid.  \nIn 1996, Congress overhauled the Act in order to \npromote competition and eliminate monopolies in the \ntelecommunications industry.  See Telecommunications \nAct of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-104, 110 Stat. 56.  As part \nof those reforms, Congress established a new frame-\nwork for achieving universal service.  See 47 U.S.C. 254.  \n\n3 \n \nThe amended Act directs the FCC to establish a set of \nprograms known collectively as the Universal Service \nFund (Fund).  See 47 U.S.C. 254(a).  It requires carriers \nthat provide interstate telecommunications services to \n\u201ccontribute\u201d to the Fund \u201con an equitable and nondis-\ncriminatory basis.\u201d  47 U.S.C. 254(d).  The Commission \nmust use the money in the Fund to subsidize universal \nservice.  See 47 U.S.C. 254(e).   \nThe Act\u2019s provisions guide and limit the FCC\u2019s exer-\ncise of that authority.  The Act requires the Commission \nto \u201cbase policies for the preservation and advancement \nof universal service\u201d on a series of specific \u201cprinciples\u201d \n\u2014for example, the principle that consumers in rural ar-\neas \u201cshould have access to telecommunications and in-\nformation services  * * *  that are reasonably compara-\nble to those services provided in urban areas.\u201d  47 \nU.S.C. 254(b)(3); see 47 U.S.C. 254(b).  The Act also re-\nquires the Commission, when deciding whether to sub-\nsidize a service, to consider certain factors\u2014for exam-\nple, the extent to which the service in question is \u201ces-\nsential to education, public health, or public safety.\u201d  47 \nU.S.C. 254(c)(1)(A); see 47 U.S.C. 254(c)(1).  \nIn accordance with the Act, the Commission has es-\ntablished four universal service programs, which assist \n(1) deployment in remote areas, (2) low-income consum-\ners, (3) schools and libraries, and (4) rural healthcare \nproviders.  See 47 C.F.R. 54.302-54.322, 54.400-54.424, \n54.500-54.523, 54.600-54.633, 54.801-54.1524.  All four \nprograms subsidize telephone and broadband services, \nsee 47 C.F.R. 54.101, and the program for schools and \nlibraries subsidizes internal connections as well, see 47 \nC.F.R. 54.502(a).   \n2. In 1997, the FCC directed the creation of the Uni-\nversal Service Administrative Company (Company) to \n\n4 \n \nhelp it administer the Fund.  See In re Changes to the \nBoard of Directors of the National Exchange Carrier \nAss\u2019n, Inc., 12 FCC Rcd 18,400, 18,418-18,419 (1997).  \nThe Company is a private, not-for-profit corporation \nchartered in Delaware.  See App., infra, 59a. \nAlthough the Company is a private body, it remains \nsubject to the Commission\u2019s oversight and control.  Its \nsole stockholder, an association of carriers, must \u201cact in \ncompliance with the [FCC\u2019s] Rules and Orders when ex-\nercising its stockholder duties and powers.\u201d  Amended \nand Restated By-Laws of Universal Service Adminis-\ntrative Company, Art. I, \u00b6 1 (rev. Jan. 26, 2024).  FCC \nrules identify the groups represented on the Company\u2019s \nBoard of Directors (e.g., consumers, carriers, and recip-\nients of universal service funding), and the FCC Chair \nselects directors after reviewing nominations from \nthose groups.  See 47 C.F.R. 54.703(b).  The Company \nalso must obtain the Commission\u2019s approval of its \nbudget.  See 47 C.F.R. 54.715(c).  \nThe FCC has \u201cappointed\u201d the Company as the \nFund\u2019s \u201cpermanent Administrator.\u201d  47 C.F.R. 54.701(a).  \nIn that role, the Company provides financial projections \nthat the FCC uses each quarter in computing the \namounts of universal service contributions.  See 47 \nC.F.R. 54.709.  The Administrator also sends out bills \nand collects contributions.  See 47 C.F.R. 54.702(b).  Fi-\nnally, the Administrator disburses money to program \nbeneficiaries in accordance with FCC rules.  See ibid.  \nAlthough the Administrator performs administra-\ntive tasks on the FCC\u2019s behalf, it exercises no independ-\nent regulatory power.  It \u201cmay not make policy, inter-\npret unclear provisions of the statute or rules, or inter-\npret the intent of Congress.\u201d  47 C.F.R. 54.702(c).  It \nmust comply with the Commission\u2019s rules, see 47 C.F.R. \n\n5 \n \n54.701-54.717, and any party that is aggrieved by its de-\ncisions may request de novo review by the Commission, \nsee 47 C.F.R. 54.719-54.725. \n3. The FCC\u2019s rules prescribe a process for compu-\nting each carrier\u2019s quarterly contribution to the Fund.  \nSee 47 C.F.R. 54.709.  At least 60 days before the begin-\nning of each quarter, the Administrator must submit to \nthe Commission its projections of the expenses (bene-\nfits plus administrative overhead) that the four univer-\nsal service programs will incur, along with \u201cthe basis for \nthose projections.\u201d  47 C.F.R. 54.709(a)(3).  And at least \n30 days before the beginning of each quarter, the Ad-\nministrator must submit a projection of the total reve-\nnues that telecommunications carriers will earn from \ninterstate and international telecommunications ser-\nvices, based on financial information provided by those \ncarriers.  See ibid. \nThe FCC uses those projections to calculate a \u201ccon-\ntribution factor\u201d\u2014i.e., a number that is based on the ra-\ntio of the projected expenses to the projected revenues.  \n47 C.F.R. 54.709(a)(2).  The Commission then announces \nthe projections and proposed contribution factor to the \npublic.  See 47 C.F.R. 54.709(a)(3).  The FCC may revise \nthe projections (and thus the contribution factor) and \nmay set them \u201cat amounts that the Commission deter-\nmines will serve the public interest.\u201d  Ibid.  If the Com-\nmission takes no action within 14 days after the an-\nnouncement, however, the projections and contribution \nfactor are \u201cdeemed approved.\u201d  Ibid. \nOnce the FCC approves the contribution factor, the \nAdministrator calculates each carrier\u2019s contribution by \napplying the factor to that carrier\u2019s \u201ccontribution base\u201d \n(generally, the carrier\u2019s interstate and international tel-\necommunications revenues).  47 C.F.R. 54.709(a)(3).  \n\n6 \n \nFor example, if the contribution factor is 25%, each car-\nrier would owe 25% of its interstate and international \ntelecommunications revenues.  Carriers may pass the \ncost of their contributions on to customers.  See 47 \nC.F.R. 54.712(a). \nB. Proceedings Below \n1. In November 2021, the Administrator submitted \nits projections of expenses and revenues for the first \nquarter of 2022.  See App., infra, 150a-159a.  Based on \nthose projections, the Commission proposed a contribu-\ntion factor of 25.2%.  See id. at 141a-149a.   \nRespondents\u2014a nonprofit organization, a carrier, \nand a group of consumers\u2014filed comments requesting \nthat the FCC set the contribution factor at 0% instead.  \nSee Gov\u2019t C.A. Br. 17.  Respondents did not object to \nthe Administrator\u2019s projections or to the Commission\u2019s \ncomputation of the contribution factor based on those \nprojections.  Respondents instead argued that the uni-\nversal service program was itself unlawful.  See App., \ninfra, 11a.  They contended that Congress had uncon-\nstitutionally delegated legislative power to the FCC and \nthat the Commission had unconstitutionally redelegated \npower to the Administrator.  See ibid.   \nThe Commission took no further action within 14 \ndays after publishing the proposed contribution factor.  \nSee App., infra, 11a.  As a result, the factor was deemed \napproved.  See ibid.  \n2. Respondents filed a petition for review in the \nFifth Circuit.  See App., infra, 11a.  A unanimous panel \ndenied the petition.  See id. at 125a-140a.  \nThe panel first rejected the FCC\u2019s argument that the \npetition for review was untimely because \u201cany challenge \nto \u00a7 254 should have come when Congress originally en-\nacted it.\u201d  App., infra, 128a.  The panel reasoned that \n\n7 \n \nthe Commission had \u201creapplied\u201d Section 254 when it \nadopted the contribution factor for the first quarter of \n2022 and that respondents therefore could properly \nraise their constitutional claim as part of their challenge \nto that agency action.  Id. at 129a.  \nOn the merits, the panel rejected respondents\u2019 claim \nthat Congress in enacting Section 254 had unconstitu-\ntionally delegated legislative power to the FCC.  See \nApp., infra, 132a-137a.  The panel determined that Sec-\ntion 254 sets forth \u201cnumerous intelligible principles\u201d \nthat constrain the FCC\u2019s exercise of its authority.  Id. \nat 137a.  The panel also rejected respondents\u2019 claim that \nthe Commission had unconstitutionally delegated gov-\nernmental power to the Company.  See id. at 137a-140a.  \nThe panel emphasized that the Company lacks inde-\npendent regulatory authority and functions \u201csubordi-\nnate[ly]\u201d to the Commission.  Id. at 140a.  \n3. The court of appeals granted respondents\u2019 peti-\ntion for rehearing en banc.  See App., infra, 160a-161a.  \nThe en banc court granted respondents\u2019 petition for re-\nview by a vote of 9-7.  See id. at 1a-118a.  \nThe en banc court held that no procedural obstacle \nprevented it from reaching the merits of the petition for \nreview.  See App., infra, 11a-18a.  The court observed \nthat respondents\u2019 challenge to the specific FCC action \nat issue here\u2014i.e., the contribution factor that the Com-\nmission had established for the first quarter of 2022\u2014\n\u201cmight be moot\u201d because sovereign immunity might \npreclude recovery of money already paid into the Uni-\nversal Service Fund.  Id. at 13a.  The court held, how-\never, that the case \u201cis nonetheless justiciable because it \nis capable of repetition yet evading review.\u201d  Ibid.  The \ncourt then rejected the argument that, because the \nCommission had prevailed against respondents in par-\n\n8 \n \nallel cases in the Sixth and Eleventh Circuits, principles \nof issue preclusion prohibited respondents from reliti-\ngating their nondelegation challenges in the Fifth Cir-\ncuit.  See id. at 14a-18a.  The court concluded that the \nFCC had forfeited that defense by raising it only after \nthis Court\u2019s denials of certiorari in the Sixth and Elev-\nenth Circuit cases, rather than immediately after the \nSixth and Eleventh Circuits\u2019 judgments.  See id. at 18a.  \nOn the merits, the en banc court stated that \u201cCon-\ngress through [Section] 254 may have delegated legis-\nlative power to FCC because it purported to confer \nupon FCC the power to tax without supplying an intel-\nligible principle to guide FCC\u2019s discretion.\u201d  App., infra, \n19a.  The court characterized Section 254\u2019s limits on the \nCommission\u2019s authority as \u201cminimal,\u201d \u201ccontentless,\u201d \u201ca \nhollow shell,\u201d and \u201cso amorphous that no reviewing \ncourt could ever possibly invalidate any FCC action.\u201d  \nId. at 27a, 29a, 41a.  The court found those nondelega-\ntion concerns to be \u201cespecially salient\u201d because Section \n254 \u201cimplicates the taxing power\u201d\u2014a \u201cquintessentially \nlegislative\u201d power.  Id. at 19a, 41a n.13. \nThe en banc court then stated that the FCC \u201cmay \nhave impermissibly delegated the taxing power to pri-\nvate entities.\u201d  App., infra, 19a.  The court concluded \nthat the Company\u2019s projections could \u201ctake legal effect \nwithout formal FCC approval.\u201d  Id. at 49a.  The court \nalso expressed the view that, as a practical matter, the \nCommission \u201c\u200a\u2018rubber stamp[s]\u2019 whatever contribution \namount [the Company] proposes.\u201d  Id. at 50a (citation \nomitted).  Finally, the court stated that Section 254 does \nnot authorize the FCC to delegate power to the Com-\npany in the first place.  See id. at 55a.  \nAlthough the en banc court was \u201chighly skeptical\u201d of \nthe constitutionality of Congress\u2019s grant of power to the \n\n9 \n \nCommission, and of the Commission\u2019s delegation of ad-\nministrative responsibilities to the Company, the court \ndid not decide whether either conferral of authority \nstanding alone would violate the Constitution.  See \nApp., infra, 64a.  The court instead held that \u201cthe com-\nbination of Congress\u2019s sweeping delegation to FCC and \nFCC\u2019s unauthorized subdelegation to [the Company] vi-\nolates the Legislative Vesting Clause.\u201d  Ibid.  In the \ncourt\u2019s view, the \u201cdouble-layered delegation\u201d at issue in \nthis case constituted \u201ca historical anomaly\u201d and under-\nmined \u201cdemocratic accountability.\u201d  Id. at 73a-74a.   \nJudge Elrod, joined by two other judges, issued a \nconcurring opinion in which she concluded that \u201cCon-\ngress\u2019s delegation of legislative power to the FCC and \nthe FCC\u2019s delegation of the taxing power to a private \nentity each individually contravene[s] the separation of \npowers.\u201d  App., infra, 82a.  Judge Ho issued a concur-\nring opinion in which he emphasized that \u201call legislative \npowers\u201d are \u201cexercised by the people we elect.\u201d  Id. at \n85a.    \nJudge Stewart, joined by six judges, dissented.  See \nApp., infra, 88a-114a.  He expressed the view that Sec-\ntion 254 \u201cevinces a clear intelligible principle delimiting \nagency discretion\u201d; that the en banc court of appeals\u2019 \nanalysis reflected an \u201cexaggerated conception of [the \nCompany\u2019s] role and discretion\u201d; and that \u201cdelegations \nof the taxing power are not subject to stricter scrutiny.\u201d  \nId. at 97a, 103a-104a.  Judge Higginson, joined by four \njudges, also dissented.  See id. at 115a-124a.  He criti-\ncized the court\u2019s \u201c\u200a\u2018combination\u2019 theory\u201d as inconsistent \nwith this Court\u2019s precedents.  Id. at 116a.   \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \nUniversal service has been an essential component \nof federal telecommunications policy ever since the \n\n10 \n \nFCC was established in 1934.  Today, universal service \nprograms ensure the availability of vital telecommuni-\ncations services to schools, libraries, rural health care \nproviders, and rural and low-income customers. \nIn the decision below, however, the en banc Fifth \nCircuit held that the universal service contribution sys-\ntem violates the nondelegation doctrine.  That decision \nconflicts with decisions of the Sixth and Eleventh Cir-\ncuits, which have rejected similar nondelegation chal-\nlenges.  It also invalidates the system that the Commis-\nsion has used for a quarter century to implement an im-\nportant Act of Congress.  If left in place, the decision \nwill upend the universal service programs, to the detri-\nment of millions of consumers nationwide.  This Court \nshould grant the petition for a writ of certiorari and re-\nverse. \nA. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s Decision Is Incorrect \nThe en banc Fifth Circuit erred in concluding that \n\u201cthe combination\u201d of Congress\u2019s delegation of power to \nthe Commission and the Commission\u2019s delegation of ad-\nministrative responsibilities to the Administrator vio-\nlates the Constitution.  App., infra, 19a.  Congress did \nnot delegate legislative power to the Commission.  The \nCommission did not delegate governmental power to \nthe Administrator.  Nor did the combination of those \ntwo conferrals of responsibility create a constitutional \nviolation.   \n1. Congress did not delegate legislative power to the \nCommission \nThe court of appeals concluded that Congress \u201cmay \nhave delegated legislative power\u201d to the FCC by em-\npowering the Commission to determine the amount of \n\n11 \n \nuniversal service contributions.  App., infra, 19a.  Sec-\ntion 254 does not effect any such delegation.   \na. Article I vests Congress with \u201c[a]ll legislative \nPowers\u201d granted by the Constitution.  U.S. Const. Art. \nI, \u00a7 1.  Congress may not delegate those legislative pow-\ners to the Executive Branch.  See A.L.A. Schechter \nPoultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495, 529 (1935).  \nBut Congress may authorize executive agencies to ex-\nercise substantial \u201cdiscretion\u201d in implementing and en-\nforcing the laws that Congress enacts.  J.W. Hampton, \nJr., & Co. v. United States, 276 U.S. 394, 406 (1928).   \nSo long as a statute sets forth an \u201cintelligible princi-\nple\u201d to guide the executive agency\u2019s actions, it effects a \nlawful grant of discretion rather than an unlawful dele-\ngation of legislative power.  See J.W. Hampton, 276 \nU.S. at 409.  A statute satisfies that requirement if it \nidentifies \u201cthe general policy, the public agency which \nis to apply it, and the boundaries of this delegated au-\nthority.\u201d  American Power & Light Co. v. SEC, 329 U.S. \n90, 105 (1946).  That test is \u201cnot demanding.\u201d  Gundy v. \nUnited States, 588 U.S. 128, 146 (2019) (plurality opin-\nion).  \u201cOnly twice in this country\u2019s history\u201d has the \nCourt held that a statute crossed that line\u2014\u201cin each \ncase because \u2018Congress had failed to articulate any pol-\nicy or standard\u2019 to confine discretion.\u201d  Ibid. (citation \nomitted).   \nBy contrast, this Court has \u201cover and over upheld \neven very broad delegations.\u201d  Gundy, 588 U.S. at 146 \n(plurality opinion).  The court has held, for example, \nthat Congress may empower agencies to regulate in the \n\u201cpublic interest,\u201d see National Broadcasting Co. v. \nUnited States, 319 U.S. 190, 225-226 (1943); to set \u201cfair \nand equitable\u201d prices, see Yakus v. United States, 321 \nU.S. 414, 422 (1944); or to establish air-quality stand-\n\n12 \n \nards that are \u201crequisite to protect the public health,\u201d \nsee Whitman v. American Trucking Ass\u2019ns, 531 U.S. \n457, 472-476 (2001). \nThe statute at issue here provides far more detailed \nguidance than others that this Court has upheld.  First, \nthe Act requires the Commission to \u201cbase policies for \nthe preservation and advancement of universal service\u201d \non six specific \u201cprinciples,\u201d 47 U.S.C. 254(b):  \n\u2022 \u201cQuality services should be available at just, reason-\nable, and affordable rates.\u201d  47 U.S.C. 254(b)(1). \n\u2022 \u201cAccess to advanced telecommunications and infor-\nmation services should be provided in all regions of \nthe Nation.\u201d  47 U.S.C. 254(b)(2).  \n\u2022 \u201cConsumers in all regions of the Nation  * * *  should \nhave access to telecommunications and information \nservices  * * *  that are reasonably comparable to \nthose services provided in urban areas and that are \navailable at rates that are reasonably comparable to \nthe rates charged for similar services in urban ar-\neas.\u201d  47 U.S.C. 254(b)(3).  \n\u2022 \u201cAll providers of telecommunications services should \nmake an equitable and nondiscriminatory contribu-\ntion to the preservation and advancement of univer-\nsal service.\u201d  47 U.S.C. 254(b)(4).  \n\u2022 \u201cThere should be specific, predictable and sufficient \nFederal and State mechanisms to preserve and ad-\nvance universal service.\u201d  47 U.S.C. 254(b)(5). \n\u2022 \u201cElementary and secondary schools and classrooms, \nhealth care providers, and libraries should have ac-\ncess to advanced telecommunications services.\u201d  47 \nU.S.C. 254(b)(6). \n\n13 \n \nSection 254(b) allows the FCC to \u201cbalance the principles \nagainst one another when they conflict.\u201d  Qwest Corp. v. \nFCC, 258 F.3d 1191, 1200 (10th Cir. 2001) (Qwest I).  But \nthe Commission \u201cmay not depart from them altogether \nto achieve some other goal.\u201d  Ibid.; see Qwest Commu-\nnications International, Inc. v. FCC, 398 F.3d 1222, \n1234 (10th Cir. 2005) (Qwest II).  \nSecond, the Act specifies the entities that must pay \nuniversal service contributions and the terms on which \nthey must do so.  See 47 U.S.C. 254(d).  \u201cEvery telecom-\nmunications carrier that provides interstate telecom-\nmunications services\u201d must contribute toward universal \nservice.  Ibid.  Those contributions must be \u201cequitable \nand nondiscriminatory.\u201d  Ibid. \nThird, the Act specifies the types of services that the \nFCC may fund.  See 47 U.S.C. 254(c).  Generally, only \n\u201ctelecommunications services\u201d may receive universal \nservice support.  47 U.S.C. 254(c)(1); see 47 U.S.C. \n153(53) (defining \u201ctelecommunications service\u201d).  And \nin determining which telecommunications services to \nfund, the Commission must consider the extent to which \nsuch services \u201care essential to education, public health, \nor public safety\u201d; have \u201cbeen subscribed to by a sub-\nstantial majority of residential customers\u201d; \u201care being \ndeployed in public telecommunications networks by tel-\necommunications carriers\u201d; and \u201care consistent with \nthe public interest, convenience, and necessity.\u201d  47 \nU.S.C. 254(c)(1).   \nFourth, the Act identifies the beneficiaries that may \nreceive subsidies and the ways in which the subsidies \nmay be used.  See 47 U.S.C. 254(e) and (h).  \u201c[O]nly an \neligible telecommunications carrier designated under \n[47 U.S.C. 214(e)] shall be eligible to receive specific \nFederal universal service support.\u201d  47 U.S.C. 254(e); \n\n14 \n \nsee 47 U.S.C. 214(e) (specifying criteria for designating \ntelecommunications carriers eligible to receive univer-\nsal service funding).  A carrier may use the funds \u201conly \nfor the provision, maintenance, and upgrading of facili-\nties and services for which the support is intended.\u201d  47 \nU.S.C. 254(e).  The Act also includes detailed provisions \ngoverning subsidies for rural healthcare providers, \nschools, and libraries.  See 47 U.S.C. 254(h).   \nFinally, the Act requires universal service support to \nbe \u201csufficient to achieve the purposes\u201d of Section 254,  \n47 U.S.C. 254(e), and specifies that services should be \n\u201caffordable,\u201d 47 U.S.C. 254(b)(1).  Those provisions con-\nstrain the program\u2019s overall size and budget.  The suffi-\nciency requirement precludes the Commission from ex-\npanding the program beyond \u201cwhat is \u2018sufficient to \nachieve the purposes of\u200a\u2019 universal service.\u201d  Consumers\u2019 \nResearch v. FCC, 67 F.4th 773, 794 (6th Cir. 2023) (cita-\ntion omitted), cert. denied, 144 S. Ct. 2628 (2024); see \nAlenco Communications, Inc. v. FCC, 201 F.3d 608, 620 \n(5th Cir. 2000) (\u201c[E]xcessive funding may itself violate \nthe sufficiency requirements of the Act.\u201d).  And the af-\nfordability principle precludes the FCC from allowing \nthe universal service contribution to become \u201cso large it \nactually makes telecommunications services less \u2018af-\nfordable.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Rural Cellular Ass\u2019n v. FCC, 588 F.3d 1095, \n1103 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (citation omitted); see Alenco, 201 \nF.3d at 620 (\u201cBecause universal service is funded by a \ngeneral pool subsidized by all telecommunications provid-\ners \u2014and thus indirectly by the customers\u2014excess sub-\nsidization in some cases may detract from universal ser-\nvice by causing rates unnecessarily to rise, thereby \npricing some consumers out of the market.\u201d). \nThe Act, in short, provides comprehensive guidance \nto the FCC on how to implement Congress\u2019s universal \n\n15 \n \nservice policy.  It sets out \u201cfrom whom funds are ex-\nacted,\u201d \u201cwho receives the benefit of the funds,\u201d and \u201cwhat \nminimum standards of service must be provided.\u201d  App., \ninfra, 93a (Stewart, J., dissenting).  The Act therefore \neffects a permissible grant of discretionary authority, \nnot an impermissible delegation of legislative power.  \nb. The court of appeals nonetheless concluded that \nSection 254 provides the Commission with \u201cno guidance \nwhatsoever.\u201d  App., infra, 30a (citation and emphasis \nomitted).  The court\u2019s stated bases for that conclusion \nlack merit.  \nThe court of appeals first stated that the FCC is au-\nthorized to use contributions \u201cto fund whatever projects \nit might like.\u201d  App., infra, 27a-28a.  That is incorrect.  \nThe Act defines \u201cuniversal service\u201d as a \u201clevel of tele-\ncommunications services\u201d established by the Commis-\nsion.  47 U.S.C. 254(c)(1).  The Commission accordingly \nmay use the Fund only for telecommunications services \n\u2014not for foreign aid, veterans\u2019 benefits, highway mainte-\nnance, or other \u201cprojects\u201d that the government \u201cmight \nlike.\u201d  App., infra, 28a.  Further constraining the FCC, \nthe Act lists factors that the FCC must consider in de-\nciding which telecommunications services to fund.  See \n47 U.S.C. 254(c)(1). \nThe court of appeals also stated that the Act\u2019s stand-\nards are \u201camorphous\u201d; that they leave the Commission \n\u201cat sea\u201d; and that \u201cno reviewing court could ever possi-\nbly invalidate any FCC action\u201d under those standards.  \nApp., infra, 27a, 31a, 41a.  But the Act constrains the \nFCC\u2019s implementation of universal service programs \nmore than the en banc court suggested.  Although the \ncourt viewed the Act as imposing no judicially enforce-\nable limits on the Commission\u2019s authority, \u201creviewing \ncourt[s],\u201d including the Fifth Circuit itself, previously \n\n16 \n \nhave \u201cinvalidate[d] FCC action\u201d when the Commission \nhas deviated from the statutory principles.  Id. at 41a; \nsee, e.g., Qwest II, 398 F.3d at 1232-1238; Qwest I, 258 \nF.3d at 1199-1200; Texas Office of Public Utility Coun-\nsel v. FCC, 183 F.3d 393, 406 (5th Cir. 1999).  And while \nthe Act\u2019s standards do not take the form of bright-line \nrules, the nondelegation doctrine does not require Con-\ngress to adopt a \u201cdeterminate criterion,\u201d American \nTrucking Ass\u2019ns, 531 U.S. at 475 (citation omitted), or \n\u201ca specific formula,\u201d Lichter v. United States, 334 U.S. \n742, 785 (1948). \nThe court of appeals emphasized that Section 254 au-\nthorizes the FCC to adopt additional universal service \nprinciples beyond those listed in the Act.  See App., in-\nfra, 28a.  But the Commission\u2019s power to adopt such \nprinciples is itself constrained by an intelligible stand-\nard:  the additional principles must be \u201cnecessary and \nappropriate for the protection of the public interest, \nconvenience, and necessity,\u201d and must be \u201cconsistent \nwith\u201d the Act.  47 U.S.C. 254(b)(7).  And in any event, \nthis case presents no question concerning the scope of \nthat authority, since the specific FCC order that re-\nspondents challenge does not adopt any such additional \nprinciples.  \nc. The court of appeals stated that \u201cthe scope of per-\nmissible delegation varies with context,\u201d and it cited \nvarious factors that, in its view, distinguished Section \n254 from other delegations that this Court has upheld.  \nApp., infra, 33a.  Those arguments, too, lack merit.  \nThe court of appeals found it \u201cespecially salient\u201d that \nSection 254 \u201cimplicates the taxing power.\u201d  App., infra, \n41a n.13.  But Congress did not need to rely on its taxing \npower to enact Section 254.  The Constitution empowers \nCongress to regulate \u201cCommerce\u201d \u201camong the several \n\n17 \n \nStates.\u201d  U.S. Const. Art. I, \u00a7 8, Cl. 3.  The commerce \npower includes the authority to regulate the channels \nand instrumentalities of interstate commerce, see \nPierce County v. Guillen, 537 U.S. 129, 147 (2003), such \nas telecommunications networks, see Pensacola Tele-\ngraph Co. v. Western Union Telegraph Co., 96 U.S. 1, 9 \n(1877).  And Congress may regulate commerce by re-\nquiring those engaged in commerce to pay money.  See \nGibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 202 (1824) (\u201c[D]uties may \noften be, and in fact often are, imposed on tonnage, with \na view to the regulation of commerce.\u201d).  The commerce \npower therefore provides an independently sufficient \nbasis for Section 254\u2019s requirement that carriers pay \nuniversal service contributions. \nIn any event, this Court has specifically rejected \u201cthe \napplication of a different and stricter nondelegation \nstandard in cases where Congress delegates discretion-\nary authority to the Executive under its taxing power.\u201d  \nSkinner v. Mid-America Pipeline Co., 490 U.S. 212, \n222-223 (1989).  The Constitution\u2019s text does not \u201cdistin-\nguish Congress\u2019 power to tax from its other enumerated \npowers  * * *  in terms of the scope and degree of dis-\ncretionary authority that Congress may delegate to the \nExecutive.\u201d  Id. at 220-221.  \u201cFrom its earliest days to \nthe present,\u201d Congress \u201chas varied the degree  * * *  of \ndiscretionary authority delegated to the Executive\u201d in \ntax statutes.  Id. at 221.  And the Court has repeatedly \napplied ordinary nondelegation principles in reviewing \ntax laws.  See, e.g., Federal Energy Administration v. \nAlgonquin SNG, Inc., 426 U.S. 548, 558-560 (1976); J.W. \nHampton, 276 U.S. at 409.   \nThe court of appeals also found Section 254 \u201cespe-\ncially troubling because the statute insulates FCC from \nthe principal tool Congress has to control FCC\u2019s univer-\n\n18 \n \nsal service decisions\u2014the appropriations power.\u201d  App., \ninfra, 31a.  But Congress exercised the appropriations \npower in Section 254 itself by authorizing the FCC to \nuse the Fund for universal service programs.  Congress \nretains the authority to repeal that appropriation. The \ncourt of appeals noted that Section 254 operates \u201cout-\nside the [annual] appropriations process,\u201d id. at 32a, but \nthe Constitution does not require an annual appropria-\ntions process.  It allows Congress to make \u201cstanding ap-\npropriations,\u201d CFPB v. Community Financial Services \nAss\u2019n of America, Ltd., 601 U.S. 416, 436 (2024), and a \ncourt may not penalize Congress\u2019s exercise of that \npower by applying a stricter nondelegation standard. \nFinally, the court of appeals asserted that Section \n254 invites the Commission to make \u201cpolicy\u201d judgments \nrather than purely \u201ctechnical\u201d judgments.  App., infra, \n34a.  But a \u201ccertain degree of discretion,\u201d and thus of \npolicymaking, \u201cinheres in most executive\u201d action.  \nAmerican Trucking Ass\u2019ns, 531 U.S. at 475 (citation \nomitted).  This Court has accordingly rejected the argu-\nment that the nondelegation doctrine precludes Con-\ngress from vesting executive agencies with authority to \nmake policy judgments.  See, e.g., Yakus, 321 U.S. at \n425-426 (\u201cIt is no objection that the [statute]  * * *  \ncall[s] for the exercise of judgment, and for the formu-\nlation of subsidiary administrative policy within the \nprescribed statutory framework.\u201d).  And the Court has \n\u201calmost never felt qualified to second-guess Congress \nregarding the permissible degree of policy judgment \nthat can be left to those executing or applying the law.\u201d  \nAmerican Trucking Ass\u2019ns, 531 U.S. at 474-475 (cita-\ntion omitted). \n\n19 \n \n2. The Commission did not delegate governmental \npower to the Administrator \nThe court of appeals separately determined that the \nFCC \u201cmay have\u201d unlawfully \u201csubdelegat[ed]\u201d legisla-\ntive power to the Administrator, a private corporation.  \nApp., infra, 19a.  But the court\u2019s analysis reflected an \n\u201cexaggerated conception of [the Administrator\u2019s] role \nand discretion.\u201d  Id. at 103a (Stewart, J., dissenting).  \na. In Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U.S. 238 (1936), \nthis Court explained that the Constitution prohibits the \nfederal government from transferring unchecked gov-\nernmental power to a private entity.  The statute at is-\nsue in that case allowed producers of two-thirds of the \ncoal in a particular district to set wages and hours for \nall producers in that district, without review by any fed-\neral agency.  See id. at 281-283.  The Court held that the \nstatute violated the Constitution by delegating to \u201cpri-\nvate persons\u201d the unchecked \u201cpower to regulate the af-\nfairs of an unwilling minority.\u201d  Id. at 311.  \nIn Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v. Adkins, 310 U.S. \n381 (1940), however, this Court clarified that the federal \ngovernment may rely on private entities to assist it in \nthe performance of its functions.  The statute at issue in \nthat case authorized local boards consisting of private \ncoal producers to propose minimum prices for coal, but \nempowered the National Bituminous Coal Commission \n(a governmental body) to approve, disapprove, or mod-\nify those prices.  See id. at 388.  The Court upheld the \nscheme because the private boards \u201cfunction[ed] subor-\ndinately\u201d to a federal agency.  Id. at 399.  The Court \nemphasized that the agency, not the boards, ultimately \n\u201cdetermine[d] the prices\u201d and that the agency \u201cha[d] \nauthority and surveillance over the [private boards\u2019] ac-\ntivities.\u201d  Ibid.  \n\n20 \n \nHere, as in Sunshine Anthracite, the relevant non-\ngovernmental actor \u201cfunction[s] subordinately to the\u201d \nresponsible federal agency and is subject to the agency\u2019s \n\u201cauthority and surveillance.\u201d  Sunshine Anthracite,  \n310 U.S. at 399.  The FCC, not the Administrator, de-\ntermines, within the limits set by Congress, how much \ncarriers must pay.  Under the FCC\u2019s rules, the amount \nof a carrier\u2019s contribution depends \u201con a contribution \nfactor determined quarterly by the Commission.\u201d   \n47 C.F.R. 54.709(a) (emphasis added).  The Administra-\ntor simply helps the Commission compute the contribu-\ntion factor by providing \u201cprojections\u201d of the universal \nservice programs\u2019 expenses and the carriers\u2019 revenues.  \n47 C.F.R. 54.709(a)(3). \nIn making the required projections, the Administra-\ntor must act in accordance with the Commission\u2019s rules.  \nThose rules establish detailed eligibility requirements \nfor universal service beneficiaries, see, e.g., 47 C.F.R. \n54.410; impose caps on particular types of support, see, \ne.g., 47 C.F.R. 54.507; and prescribe precise formulas \nfor calculating the amount of the subsidy, see, e.g., 47 \nC.F.R. 54.604-54.606.  Those rules also require the Ad-\nministrator to project total carrier revenues based on \nthe information contained in forms that the carriers file \neach quarter.  See 47 C.F.R. 54.709(a)(2), 54.711(a).  The \nspecificity of those rules ensures that, in making the \nprojections, the Administrator performs a ministerial \ntask.  \nThe FCC may exercise additional powers of supervi-\nsion after the Administrator makes its projections for a \nparticular quarter.  Projections of program expenses \n\u201cmust be approved by the Commission before they are \nused to calculate the quarterly contribution factor.\u201d  47 \nC.F.R. 54.709(a)(3).  To that end, the Administrator \n\n21 \n \nmust submit projections of the programs\u2019 expenses at \nleast 60 days before the start of the quarter.  See ibid.  \nIt must also submit \u201cthe basis for those projections.\u201d  \nIbid.  Those rules enable the Commission and its staff \nto review (and if necessary revise) the projections be-\nfore using them to calculate the contribution factor.   \nThe Commission then uses those projections to com-\npute a quarterly contribution factor, which it announces \nin a public notice and on its website.  See 47 C.F.R. \n54.709(a)(3).  The Commission \u201creserves the right\u201d to \nrevise the factor within the 14-day period following the \nissuance of the public notice.  Ibid.  Only if the FCC fails \nto take further action during that 14-day period is the \nfactor \u201cdeemed approved.\u201d  Ibid.  The Administrator \nmust then \u201ccalculate the amount of individual contribu-\ntions\u201d by \u201capply[ing] the quarterly contribution factor\u201d \nto each individual carrier\u2019s revenues.  Ibid.   \nFurther limiting the Administrator\u2019s role, a carrier \nthat is aggrieved by the Administrator\u2019s actions may \nseek de novo review before the Commission.  See 47 \nC.F.R. 54.719(b).  The FCC\u2019s rules provide, moreover, \nthat the Administrator \u201cmay not make policy, interpret \nunclear provisions of the statute or rules, or interpret \nthe intent of Congress.\u201d  47 C.F.R. 54.702(c).  If the stat-\nute or the rules \u201care unclear, or do not address a partic-\nular situation, the Administrator shall seek guidance \nfrom the Commission.\u201d  Ibid.  Thus, if the Administra-\ntor confronts an unsettled legal or policy issue in the \ncourse of calculating projections (or taking any other \naction), it must seek guidance from the FCC rather than \nresolving the issue itself.  \nThe Administrator, in short, performs an advisory \nrole; it has no independent substantive power to set the \ncontribution factor or the amount of individual carriers\u2019 \n\n22 \n \ncontributions.  In performing that role under the FCC\u2019s \n\u201cauthority and surveillance,\u201d Sunshine Anthracite, 310 \nU.S. at 399, the Administrator does not exercise govern-\nmental power. \nb. The court of appeals nevertheless concluded that \nthe Commission \u201cmay have impermissibly delegated \nthe taxing power\u201d to the Administrator.  App., infra, \n19a.  The court\u2019s analysis was flawed.  \nThe court of appeals stated that, under the FCC\u2019s \nrules, the Administrator\u2019s \u201cprojections take legal effect \nwithout formal FCC approval\u201d if the Commission takes \nno further action within 14 days after announcing the \ncontribution factor.  App., infra, 49a.  But the projec-\ntions have no independent legal effect.  Only the contri-\nbution factor has legal effect, and it is \u201cdetermined by \nthe Commission.\u201d  47 C.F.R. 54.709(a)(2).  The projec-\ntions, in any event, \u201cmust be approved by the Commis-\nsion before they are used to calculate the quarterly con-\ntribution factor.\u201d  47 C.F.R. 54.709(a)(3).  And the Com-\nmission may review the Administrator\u2019s projections not \nonly during the 14-day period after the FCC announces \nthe contribution factor, but also before announcing the \nfactor in the first place.  See pp. 20-21, supra.  \nThe court of appeals also asserted that the Commis-\nsion \u201crubber stamp[s]\u201d the Administrator\u2019s projections, \nso that the FCC exercises only \u201cde jure\u201d rather than \u201cde \nfacto\u201d control.  App., infra, 7a.  That claim is both le-\ngally irrelevant and factually incorrect.  As a legal mat-\nter, the relevant question is whether the Commission \nhas the \u201cauthority\u201d to reject or modify the Administra-\ntor\u2019s proposals, not how often the Commission exercises \nthat power in practice.  Sunshine Anthracite, 310 U.S. \nat 399; cf. United States v. Arthrex, Inc., 594 U.S. 1, 27 \n(2021) (plurality opinion) (\u201c[A principal officer] need not \n\n23 \n \nreview every decision of the [inferior officer].  What \nmatters is that the [principal officer] have the discretion \nto review decisions rendered by [inferior officers].\u201d).  \nThe court of appeals did not deny that the FCC retains \nplenary authority to review and revise the projections.  \nAs a factual matter, moreover, the FCC does conduct \nmeaningful review of the Administrator\u2019s actions.  On \nseveral occasions, including twice in 2023, the Commis-\nsion has departed from the Administrator\u2019s projections \nwhen calculating the quarterly contribution factor.  See, \ne.g., FCC, Proposed Fourth Quarter 2023 Universal Ser-\nvice Contribution Factor, DA 23-843, 2023 WL 6036327, \nat *1 (released Sept. 13, 2023); FCC, Proposed Third \nQuarter 2023 Universal Service Contribution Factor, \nDA 23-507, 2023 WL 4012359, at *1 (released June 14, \n2023); FCC, Revised Second Quarter 2003 Universal \nService Contribution Factor, 18 FCC Rcd 5097, 5097 \n(released Mar. 21, 2003).  The Commission also has \nawarded relief when it has disagreed with the Adminis-\ntrator\u2019s calculation of the contributions owed by individ-\nual carriers.  See, e.g., In re Universal Service Contri-\nbution Methodology, 31 FCC Rcd 13,220, 13,220 (2016).  \nThe relative infrequency with which the FCC revises \nthe Administrator\u2019s decisions reflects the Administra-\ntor\u2019s limited role, the detailed regulations constraining \nits actions, and the Commission\u2019s general oversight of \nits activities.  See App., infra, 121a (Higginson, J., dis-\nsenting).  \nThe court of appeals cited previous instances of \nfraud in the program.  See App., infra, 8a.  But FCC \nrules require the Administrator to undergo annual au-\ndits to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse.  See 47 C.F.R. \n54.717.  The Commission also regularly directs the Ad-\nministrator to take corrective action to recover improper \n\n24 \n \npayments made in the past and eliminate such payments \nin the future.  See, e.g., Letter from Mark Stephens, Man-\naging Dir., FCC, to Radha Sekar, CEO, USAC (Jan. 14, \n2021), https://www.fcc.gov/sites/default/files/fcc-letter-\nto-usac-01142021.pdf.  More fundamentally, although \npast instances of waste and fraud are \u201cconcerning,\u201d \n\u201cthis has never been enough to declare a coequal politi-\ncal branch\u2019s act unconstitutional.\u201d  App., infra, 122a \n(Higginson, J., dissenting).  \nFinally, the court of appeals stated that Section 254 \n\u201cdoes not authorize\u201d the Commission to delegate power \nto the Administrator.  App., infra, 55a.  But as the court \nacknowledged, respondents have not challenged the \nAdministrator\u2019s role on statutory grounds.  See id. at \n63a n.21.  In any event, for the reasons discussed above, \nthe FCC did not delegate governmental power to the \nAdministrator.  It assigned the Administrator a minis-\nterial task\u2014which the en banc court acknowledged is \npermissible.  See id. at 56a-57a.   \n3. The court of appeals\u2019 \u201ccombination\u201d theory is wrong \nAs explained above, the court of appeals was \u201chighly \nskeptical\u201d that the quarterly contribution factor at issue \nhere comports with either \u201cthe bar on congressional \ndelegations of legislative power\u201d or \u201cthe general rule \nthat private entities may not wield governmental power.\u201d  \nApp., infra, 64a.  The court declined, however, to defin-\nitively \u201cresolve either question in this case.\u201d  Ibid.  The \ncourt instead held that \u201cthe combination\u201d of Congress\u2019s \n\u201cdelegation\u201d to the FCC and the FCC\u2019s \u201csubdelegation\u201d \nto the Administrator \u201cviolates the Legislative Vesting \nClause.\u201d  Ibid.   \nThe court of appeals\u2019 \u201ccombination\u201d theory conflicts \nwith this Court\u2019s decision in Sunshine Anthracite.  See \nApp., infra, 116a-117a (Higginson, J., dissenting).  In \n\n25 \n \nthat case, as discussed above, an agency set coal prices \nbased on proposals made by private coal producers.  See \np. 19, supra.  The challengers argued that the scheme \nviolated both the public nondelegation doctrine (by em-\npowering the agency to set prices) and the private non-\ndelegation doctrine (by allowing private entities to play \na role in the process by which those prices were deter-\nmined).  See Sunshine Anthracite, 310 U.S. at 397-399.  \nThis Court rejected the public nondelegation claim, ex-\nplaining that Congress had specified \u201cwholly adequate\u201d \n\u201ccriteria\u201d to guide the agency.  Id. at 398.  The Court \nthen rejected the private nondelegation claim, noting \nthat the agency had \u201cauthority and surveillance\u201d over \nthe private entities\u2019 activities.  Id. at 399.  The Court \n\u201cended its analysis of both delegation challenges there\u201d; \nit did not suggest that the combination of the two con-\nferrals of authority required a further analysis beyond \nthat needed to evaluate each challenge taken on its own.  \nApp., infra, 116a (Higginson, J., dissenting).  \nThe court of appeals drew an analogy to this Court\u2019s \nholding in Free Enterprise Fund v. PCAOB, 561 U.S. \n477 (2010), that Article II precludes Congress from \ngranting two layers of tenure protection to certain ex-\necutive officers.  See App., infra, 66a.  That analogy is \ninapt.  In Free Enterprise Fund, the Court emphasized \nthat a \u201csecond level of tenure protection\u201d \u201ctransforms\u201d \nan agency\u2019s independence by \u201cchang[ing] the nature of \nthe President\u2019s review.\u201d  561 U.S. at 496.  By contrast, \nthe supposed second level of delegation in this case\u2014\nthe FCC\u2019s reliance on the Administrator\u2019s non-binding \nprojections in computing the contribution factor\u2014has \nno such transformative effect.  The FCC still decides, \nwithin the bounds set by Congress, how much carriers \n\n26 \n \nmust pay; the Administrator simply provides data to as-\nsist the Commission in making that decision.  \nThe court of appeals\u2019 theory fails on its own terms \nanyway.  The court acknowledged that \u201c[t]here cannot \nbe a combined public/private delegation without a pri-\nvate delegation.\u201d  App., infra, 79a.  No private delega-\ntion exists here.  As discussed above, the Administrator \nmakes recommendations but exercises no independent \ngovernmental power in the quarterly process of setting \nthe contribution factor.  See pp. 19-24, supra. \nB. The Questions Presented Warrant This Court\u2019s Review \n1. The en banc Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision warrants this \nCourt\u2019s review because it creates a circuit conflict.  In \naddition to their present challenge, respondents also \nfiled petitions for review in the Sixth and Eleventh Cir-\ncuits to pursue nondelegation challenges to other FCC \norders setting quarterly contribution factors for differ-\nent time periods.  See Consumers\u2019 Research, 67 F.4th \nat 778 (6th Cir.); Consumers\u2019 Research v. FCC, 88 F.4th \n917, 921 (11th Cir. 2023), cert. denied, 144 S. Ct. 2629 \n(2024).  Unlike the Fifth Circuit, the Sixth and Eleventh \nCircuits rejected those challenges.   \nThe Sixth Circuit held that Section 254 \u201cdoes not vi-\nolate the nondelegation doctrine\u201d because the statute \n\u201ccontains an intelligible principle.\u201d  Consumers\u2019 Re-\nsearch, 67 F.4th at 797.  That court also held that \u201cthere \nis no private-nondelegation doctrine violation\u201d because \nthe Administrator is \u201csubordinat[e] to the FCC\u201d and \nprovides only \u201cministerial support.\u201d  Ibid.  The Elev-\nenth Circuit similarly concluded that \u201cthere are no un-\nconstitutional delegations under [Section 254] because \nCongress has laid out the principles the FCC must fol-\nlow.\u201d  Consumers\u2019 Research, 88 F.4th at 928.  It also \nconcluded that \u201cthere is no violation of the private non-\n\n27 \n \ndelegation doctrine\u201d because the Administrator \u201cis sub-\nordinate to the FCC\u201d and \u201cthe FCC retains ultimate de-\ncision-making power.\u201d  Ibid.  Neither the Sixth nor the \nEleventh Circuit suggested that the combination of the \ntwo nondelegation challenges required an additional \nanalysis beyond that needed to resolve the challenges \nseparately.  \nThe decision below also is in tension with the D.C. \nCircuit\u2019s decision in Rural Cellular Ass\u2019n v. FCC, 685 \nF.3d 1083 (2012).  In that case, the D.C. Circuit held that \nSection 254 does not unconstitutionally delegate legis-\nlative power to the Commission.  See id. at 1091-1092.  \nThe court explained that Section 254 \u201cclearly provides \nan intelligible principle to guide the Commission\u2019s ef-\nforts.\u201d  Id. at 1091.  That case did not, however, involve \nany challenge under the private nondelegation doctrine.  \n2. Even apart from the circuit conflict, the decision \nbelow warrants further review because it invalidates \nthe FCC\u2019s implementation of a federal statute.  Judging \nthe constitutionality of an Act of Congress is \u201cthe grav-\nest and most delicate duty\u201d that courts are called on to \nperform.  Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U.S. 142, 148 (1927) \n(opinion of Holmes, J.).  Accordingly, \u201cwhen a lower \ncourt has invalidated a federal statute,\u201d this Court\u2019s \n\u201cusual\u201d approach is to grant review.  Iancu v. Brunetti, \n588 U.S. 388, 392 (2019). \nAlthough the court of appeals stated that it was not \nholding Section 254 unconstitutional, see App., infra, \n19a, the court\u2019s analysis reflected its \u201cgrave concerns \nabout \u00a7 254\u2019s constitutionality,\u201d id. at 42a.  The court\u2019s \nview that Section 254 \u201cmay have delegated legislative \npower\u201d to the FCC was one of two conclusions that, in \n\u201ccombination,\u201d led the court to find a constitutional vio-\nlation.  Id. at 19a.  And while the court did not invalidate \n\n28 \n \nthe statute on its face, it did invalidate the way in which \nthe Commission has implemented the statute for more \nthan two decades (i.e., using the Administrator\u2019s projec-\ntions in setting the quarterly contribution factor).  The \nFifth Circuit\u2019s decision is therefore analogous to a deci-\nsion invalidating a federal statute as applied to particu-\nlar circumstances\u2014a type of decision that this Court \nroutinely reviews even in the absence of a circuit con-\nflict.  See, e.g., Vidal v. Elster, 602 U.S. 286, 292 (2024); \nAgency for International Development v. Alliance for \nOpen Society International, Inc., 591 U.S. 430, 433 \n(2020); DHS v. Thuraissigiam, 591 U.S. 103, 116 (2020).   \n3. The practical consequences of the decision below \nunderscore the need for this Court\u2019s review.  For more \nthan a quarter-century, the universal service programs \nhave made telephone service affordable for rural and \nlow-income consumers.  Those programs have sup-\nported the provision of essential services by rural health \ncare providers.  And they have facilitated internet ac-\ncess in schools and libraries across the Nation.  \nThe decision below, however, threatens to nullify the \nuniversal service programs\u2014to the detriment of the \u201cmil-\nlions of Americans\u201d whom those programs serve.  App., \ninfra, 123a (Higginson, J., dissenting).  If the Fifth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s decision is allowed to take effect, carriers in that \ncircuit (and perhaps elsewhere) are likely to argue that \nthey no longer have a legal obligation to make universal \nservice contributions because the FCC and the Admin-\nistrator lack the power to collect such payments.  Such \na development would devastate the FCC\u2019s ability to en-\nsure sufficient funding for universal service subsidies \ngoing forward.  \n4. This Court should grant certiorari on all three \nquestions presented: whether Congress impermissibly \n\n29 \n \ndelegated legislative power to the FCC, whether the \nCommission impermissibly delegated governmental \npower to the Administrator, and whether the combina-\ntion of the two alleged delegations violates the Consti-\ntution.  Although the court of appeals ultimately rested \nits decision on its resolution of the third issue, consider-\nation of the other two issues is a necessary \u201cpredicate \nto an intelligent resolution\u201d of the third question.  Helix \nEnergy Solutions Group, Inc. v. Hewitt, 598 U.S. 39, 50 \nn.3 (2023) (citation omitted).  It would make little sense \nto analyze the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \u201ccombination\u201d theory, \nApp., infra, 19a, without considering the components of \nthat combination.  Although the Court might ultimately \nresolve this case without answering all three questions, \ngranting review on all three would ensure that the \nCourt can fully consider all aspects of respondents\u2019 \nchallenge.   \nC. This Case Is An Appropriate Vehicle For Resolving The \nQuestions Presented \n1. The en banc court of appeals and the panel dis-\ncussed three threshold procedural issues.  But none of \nthose issues would prevent this Court from reaching the \nquestions presented.  \nFirst, the en banc court suggested sua sponte that \nthe case \u201cmight be moot\u201d because sovereign immunity \nmight preclude respondents from recovering money al-\nready paid into the Fund.  App., infra, 13a.  The court \ncorrectly held, however, that this case is \u201cnonetheless \njusticiable because it is capable of repetition yet evad-\ning review.\u201d  Ibid.  That exception to mootness applies \nwhere \u201c(1) the challenged action is in its duration too \nshort to be fully litigated prior to cessation or expira-\ntion, and (2) there is a reasonable expectation that the \nsame complaining party will be subject to the same ac-\n\n30 \n \ntion again.\u201d  Davis v. FEC, 554 U.S. 724, 735 (2008) (ci-\ntation omitted).  This case satisfies the first require-\nment because an FCC order setting the quarterly con-\ntribution factor lasts just one quarter.   See Kingdom-\nware Technologies, Inc. v. United States, 579 U.S. 162, \n170 (2016) (explaining that \u201ca period of two years\u201d is of-\nten \u201ctoo short to complete judicial review\u201d).  And this \ncase satisfies the second requirement because the Com-\nmission calculates a new contribution factor every quar-\nter.  See App., infra, 14a.  \nSecond, the FCC argued to the panel that respond-\nents\u2019 petition for review was untimely because \u201cany \nchallenge to \u00a7 254 should have come when Congress \noriginally enacted it.\u201d  App., infra, 128a.  The panel re-\njected that contention, see ibid., and the Commission \ndid not renew the argument at the en banc stage.  The \npanel\u2019s rejection of that argument was correct.  The ap-\nplicable judicial-review provision states that \u201c[a]ny \nparty aggrieved by the [agency\u2019s] final order may, \nwithin 60 days after its entry, file a petition to review \nthe order.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2344.  Respondents filed their pe-\ntition \u201cwithin 60 days after\u201d the \u201cfinal order\u201d\u2014i.e., the \nFCC order that established the applicable contribution \nfactor for the first quarter of 2022\u2014that respondents \nsought to challenge.  Ibid. \nFinally, the en banc court rejected the argument \nthat, under the doctrine of issue preclusion, the Sixth \nand Eleventh Circuits\u2019 decisions precluded respondents \nfrom relitigating their nondelegation claims in this case.  \nSee App., infra, 14a.  The court held that the govern-\nment had forfeited that argument by raising it after this \nCourt denied certiorari rather than immediately after \nthe Sixth and Eleventh Circuits issued their decisions.  \nSee ibid.  The government does not seek this Court\u2019s \n\n31 \n \nreview of that holding.  As the en banc court noted, if \nthe Fifth Circuit did not reach the merits here, it would \nstill need to decide them in a separate pending case \n\u201cthat includes petitioners who were not parties to the \nSixth or Eleventh Circuit proceedings.\u201d  Id. at 18a;  \nsee Pet. for Review, Consumers\u2019 Research v. FCC, No. \n24-60330 (5th Cir. Jun. 27, 2024).  And since issue pre-\nclusion does not concern subject-matter jurisdiction, \nsee Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Industries Corp., \n544 U.S. 280, 293 (2005), this Court would have no inde-\npendent obligation to address the issue.* \n2. After this Court denied the petitions for writs of \ncertiorari in the Sixth and Eleventh Circuit cases, the \nchallengers filed petitions for rehearing asking the \nCourt to reconsider those denials.  See Pet. for Reh\u2019g, \nConsumers\u2019 Research, supra (No. 23-456); Pet. for Reh\u2019g, \nConsumers\u2019 Research, supra (No. 23-743).  The Court \nhas not yet acted on those rehearing petitions.  In the \ngovernment\u2019s view, the best course would be to grant \ncertiorari in this case, rather than in one or both of \nthose cases.  Granting certiorari in this case would ena-\n \n*  Contrary to the Fifth Circuit\u2019s suggestion, the government did \nnot seek to \u201cevade\u201d this Court\u2019s review in its brief in opposition to \nthe petitions for writs of certiorari in the Sixth and Eleventh Circuit \ncases.  App., infra, 18a n.5.  In those petitions, which were filed be-\nfore the en banc court issued the decision below, the challengers as-\nserted that the en banc Fifth Circuit was \u201cpoised to create\u201d a circuit \nconflict.  Pet. at 34, Consumers\u2019 Research v. FCC, 144 S. Ct. 2628 \n(2024) (No. 23-456); Pet. at 38, Consumers\u2019 Research v. FCC, 144 S. \nCt. 2629 (2024) (No. 23-743).  The government simply responded \nthat \u201cthe en banc Fifth Circuit ha[d] not yet issued its decision\u201d and \nthat, \u201c[o]nce it does so, the parties can determine whether to seek, \nand this Court can determine whether to grant, certiorari to review \nthat decision.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Br. in Opp. at 17-18, Consumers\u2019 Research, \nsupra (No. 23-456). \n\n32 \n \nble this Court to directly review the reasoning of the \nonly court that has found a nondelegation violation in \nthe FCC\u2019s implementation of Section 254.  \nD. In The Alternative, The Court Should Hold This Peti-\ntion For A Writ Of Certiorari Pending The Court\u2019s Res-\nolution Of Wisconsin Bell  \nThis Court has granted review in Wisconsin Bell, \nInc. v. United States ex rel. Heath, No. 23-1127 (oral ar-\ngument scheduled for Nov. 4, 2024), in order to consider \nwhether a request for reimbursement under a universal \nservice program is a \u201cclaim\u201d governed by the False \nClaims Act, 31 U.S.C. 3721 et seq.  Congress defined  \nthe term \u201c\u200a\u2018claim\u2019\u200a\u201d to include requests for money pre-\nsented to an \u201cagent of the United States,\u201d 31 U.S.C. \n3729(b)(2)(A)(i), as well as certain requests for money if \nthe government \u201cprovides\u201d any portion of the funds re-\nquested, 31 U.S.C. 3729(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I).  This Court\u2019s \nresolution of those issues in Wisconsin Bell could shed \nlight on the nature of the FCC\u2019s relationship with the \nCompany\u2014which, in turn, could affect the nondelega-\ntion analysis in this case.  The challengers\u2019 rehearing \npetitions in the Sixth and Eleventh Circuit cases recog-\nnized Wisconsin Bell\u2019s relevance to the nondelegation \nissues raised here.  See Pet. for Reh\u2019g at 3, Consumers\u2019 \nResearch, supra (No. 23-456); Pet. for Reh\u2019g at 3, Con-\nsumers\u2019 Research, supra (No. 23-743).   \nIn the government\u2019s view, the best course would be \nto grant review in this case and to resolve the uncer-\ntainty created by the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision.  But if this \nCourt does not grant review in this case, it should hold \nthis petition for a writ of certiorari pending the Court\u2019s \nresolution of Wisconsin Bell.  \n\n33 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be \ngranted.  In the alternative, the petition should be held \npending this Court\u2019s resolution of Wisconsin Bell v. \nUnited States ex rel. Heath, No. 23-1127 (oral argument \nscheduled for Nov. 4, 2024), and then disposed of as ap-\npropriate.  \nRespectfully submitted. \nP. MICHELE ELLISON \nGeneral Counsel \nJACOB M.

OLDHAM, Circuit Judge, joined by JONES, \nSMITH, ELROD, WILLETT, HO, DUNCAN, ENGELHARDT, \nand WILSON, Circuit Judges: \nIn the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Congress \ndelegated its taxing power to the Federal Communica-\ntions Commission.  FCC then subdelegated the taxing \npower to a private corporation.  That private corpora-\ntion, in turn, relied on for-profit telecommunications \ncompanies to determine how much American citizens \nwould be forced to pay for the \u201cuniversal service\u201d tax \nthat appears on cell phone bills across the Nation.  We \nhold this misbegotten tax violates Article I, \u00a7 1 of the \nConstitution. \nI. \nA. \nCongress has long \u201cpursued a policy of providing \n\u2018universal\u2019 [telecommunications] service to all residents \nand businesses in the United States.\u201d  Ronald J. Kro-\ntoszynski, Jr., Reconsidering the Nondelegation Doc-\ntrine:  Universal Service, the Power to Tax, and the \nRatification Doctrine, 80 IND. L.J. 239, 279 (2005).  \nFor half a century Congress pursued this policy through \na complicated cross-subsidy regime.  Back when the \nold AT&T was a regulated monopoly, Congress allowed \nit to charge supra-competitive rates to urban customers \nin exchange for requiring it to provide services it might \nnot otherwise provide to high-cost rural customers.  \nBut \u201c[f\u200a]or obvious reasons, this system of implicit subsi-\ndies can work well only under regulated conditions.  In \na competitive environment, a carrier that tries to subsi-\ndize below-cost rates to rural customers with above-cost \nrates to urban customers is vulnerable to a competitor \n\n3a \n \nthat offers at-cost rates to urban customers.\u201d  Tex. Off. \nof Pub. Util. Couns. v. FCC (\u201cTOPUC I\u201d), 183 F.3d 393, \n406 (5th Cir. 1999).  So when Congress deregulated \nAT&T and other telecommunications companies, it had \nto abandon the old way of pursuing universal service. \nCongress\u2019s new way is 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254.  Section 254 \nauthorizes FCC to establish \u201cspecific, predictable, and \nsufficient  . . .  mechanisms to preserve and advance \nuniversal service.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 254(b)(5).  Pursuant to this \ngrant of authority, FCC levies \u201ccontributions\u201d to a Uni-\nversal Service Fund (\u201cUSF\u201d) from telecommunications \ncarriers, id. \u00a7 254(b)(4), and it distributes the monies \nraised to people, entities, and projects to expand and ad-\nvance telecommunications services.  FCC regulations \nexpressly permit carriers to pass these \u201ccontributions\u201d \nthrough to their customers, see 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.712(a), \nand the overwhelming majority of carriers do so, see \nFCC, FCC 22-67, Report on the Future of the Universal \nService Fund 10084-85, (Aug. 15, 2022) (\u201cReport to Con-\ngress\u201d). \nNotably, Congress declined to define \u201cuniversal ser-\nvice\u201d itself.  Instead, it delegated to FCC the responsi-\nbility to periodically \u201cestablish\u201d the concept of \u201cuniver-\nsal service\u201d by \u201ctaking into account advances in telecom-\nmunications and information technologies and services.\u201d  \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(c)(1).  In making this determination, \nCongress directed FCC to: \nconsider the extent to which such telecommunica-\ntions services\u2014 \n(A) are essential to education, public health, or \npublic safety; \n\n4a \n \n(B) have, through the operation of market choices \nby customers, been subscribed to by a sub-\nstantial majority of residential customers; \n(C) are being deployed in public telecommunica-\ntions networks by telecommunications carri-\ners; and \n(D) are consistent with the public interest, con-\nvenience, and necessity. \nId. \u00a7 254(c)(1). \nSection 254(b) also suggests principles for FCC to \n\u201cbase policies for the preservation and advancement of \nuniversal service.\u201d  Telecommunications services \u201cshould\u201d \nbe \u201cavailable at just, reasonable, and affordable rates\u201d; \naccessible \u201cin all regions of the Nation\u201d; and available to \n\u201clow-income consumers and those in rural, insular, and \nhigh cost areas\u201d at rates \u201creasonably comparable to \nrates charged for similar services in urban areas.\u201d  Id. \n\u00a7 254(b)(1)-(3).  FCC also may develop \u201csuch other \n[universal service principles it] determine[s] are neces-\nsary and appropriate for the protection of the public in-\nterest, convenience, and necessity and are consistent \nwith this chapter.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 254(b)(7). \nSection 254 further provides that \u201c[e]lementary and \nsecondary schools and classrooms, health care provid-\ners, and libraries should have access to advanced tele-\ncommunications services.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 254(b)(6).  Accord-\ningly, \u201ctelecommunications carrier[s] shall, upon receiv-\ning a bona fide request, provide telecommunications ser-\nvices which are necessary for the provision of health \ncare services in a State  . . .  to any public or non-\nprofit health care provider that serves persons who re-\nside in rural areas in that State at rates that are reason-\n\n5a \n \nably comparable to rates charged for similar services in \nurban areas in that State.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 254(h)(1)(A).  And \n\u201ctelecommunications carriers  . . .  shall, upon a bona \nfide request for any of its services that are within the \n[FCC\u2019s] definition of universal service  . . .  , provide \nsuch services to elementary schools, secondary schools, \nand libraries for educational purposes at rates less than \nthe amounts charged for similar services to other par-\nties.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 254(h)(1)(B).  FCC then reimburses telecom-\nmunications providers for the costs of providing this \nsubsidized service.  Id. \u00a7 254(h)(1)(A), (B)(i)-(ii). \nB. \nPresently, USF supports telecommunications pro-\njects through four major programs:  the High-Cost \nProgram (see 47 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 54.302-54.322), the Lifeline \nProgram (see id. \u00a7\u00a7 54.400-54.423), the E-rate Program \n(see id. \u00a7\u00a7 54.500-54.523), and the Rural Health Care \nProgram (see id. \u00a7\u00a7 54.600-54.633). \nEach program has a laudable objective.  The High-\nCost Program subsidizes the provision of voice and in-\nternet services in rural communities.  The Lifeline Pro-\ngram subsidizes the provision of phone service to low- \nincome consumers.  The E-Rate Program subsidizes \nthe provision of broadband connectivity and Wi-Fi to \nschools and libraries.  And the Rural Health Care Pro-\ngram subsidizes the provision of telecommunications \nservices to rural healthcare providers. \nFCC regulations establish the services supported by \neach of these programs and the eligibility criteria appli-\ncants must satisfy to obtain assistance.  But FCC does \nnot administer all these universal service programs it-\nself.  Instead, it relies on a private company called the \n\n6a \n \nUniversal Service Administrative Company (\u201cUSAC\u201d).  \nUSAC is managed by representatives from \u201cinterest \ngroups affected by and interested in universal service \nprograms\u201d who are \u201cnominated by their respective in-\nterest groups.\u201d  See Leadership, UNIVERSAL SERV. AD-\nMIN. CO., https://perma.cc/9W92G4Z9 (last accessed \nSept. 11, 2023); see also 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.703(b) (providing \nfor the composition of USAC\u2019s board of directors).  \nFCC has charged USAC with myriad tasks:  \u201cbilling \ncontributors, collecting contributions to the universal \nservice support mechanisms, and disbursing universal \nservice support funds.\u201d  47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.702(b). \nMost prominently, though, USAC is responsible for \ndeciding the quarterly USF contribution amount\u2014a \nprojection of the dollar value of demand for universal \nsupport programs and the costs of administering them. \nSee id. \u00a7 54.709(a)(3).  The contribution amount dic-\ntates the size of the universal service contributions lev-\nied on telecommunications carriers and, in turn, Ameri-\ncan telecommunications consumers.  To set the contri-\nbution amount, USAC relies on \u201cinformation from uni-\nversal service program participants\u201d to \u201cestimate[] how \nmuch money will be needed each quarter to provide uni-\nversal service support.\u201d  See Universal Service, UNIVER-\nSAL SERV. ADMIN. CO., https://perma.cc/B5NN-AVF8 \n(last accessed Oct. 10, 2023).  In other words, the con-\ntribution amount ultimately derives from the universal \nservice demand projections of private, for-profit tele-\ncommunications carriers, all of whom have \u201chave finan-\ncial incentives\u201d to increase the size of universal service \nprograms.  U.S. GOV\u2019T ACCOUNTABILITY OFF., GAO-\n17-538, ADDITIONAL ACTION NEEDED TO ADDRESS SIG-\nNIFICANT RISKS IN FCC\u2019S LIFELINE PROGRAM 1 (2017), \n\n7a \n \nhttps://perma.cc/K5J9-L89K (\u201cFCC\u2019s Lifeline Pro-\ngram\u201d). \nFCC then uses USAC\u2019s contribution amount to im-\npose a tax on America\u2019s telecommunications carriers. \n(FCC calls this tax the USF \u201ccontribution factor\u201d; but \nwe call it what it is\u2014the \u201cUSF Tax.\u201d)  The USF Tax is \nthe percentage of end-user telecommunications reve-\nnues each carrier must contribute to USF in a particular \nquarter.  As a practical matter, USAC sets the USF \nTax\u2014subject only to FCC\u2019s rubber stamp.  True,  \nFCC \u201creserves the right to set projections of demand \nand administrative expenses at amounts that [it] deter-\nmines will serve the public interest.\u201d  See 47 C.F.R.  \n\u00a7 54.709(a)(3).  But FCC never made a substantive re-\nvision to USAC\u2019s proposed contribution amount prior to \nthis litigation,1 and it does not even have a documented \nprocess for checking USAC\u2019s work.  Instead, FCC  \nhas provided that if it \u201ctake[s] no action within fourteen \n(14) days of the date of release of the public notice an-\nnouncing [USAC\u2019s] projections of demand and adminis-\ntrative expenses, the projections of demand and admin-\nistrative expenses  . . .  shall be deemed approved by \nthe Commission.\u201d  See ibid. (emphasis added).  So \nFCC has delegated to USAC responsibility\u2014de facto if \nnot de jure\u2014for imposing the USF Tax. \n \n \n \n1  FCC claims it has made three alterations to USF projections.  \nBut one of those was a ministerial change of the rate from .09044 \nto .091 because some carriers\u2019 computers could not handle five dec-\nimal places.  And the other two were not even initiated by FCC.  \nSee Petrs\u2019 EB Br. 63. \n\n8a \n \nC. \nIn 1995, the USF Tax was $1.37 billion.  JA62.  But \nby the end of 2021, USAC ballooned the USF to over $9 \nbillion.  See UNIVERSAL SERV. ADMIN. CO., 2021 An-\nnual Report 20 (2023) https://perma.cc/9CPT-H5LM.  \nThe proposed USF Tax at issue in this case is 25.2%, up \nfrom just over 5% in 2000.  See FCC, DA 00-517, PRO-\nPOSED SECOND QUARTER 2000 UNIVERSAL SERVICE \nCONTRIBUTION FACTOR (Mar. 7, 2000), https://perma. \ncc/4BSK-6QZR.  Recent USF Taxes have been set as \nhigh as 34.5%.  See FCC, DA 23-843, PROPOSED FOURTH \nQUARTER 2023 UNIVERSAL SERVICE CONTRIBUTION \nFACTOR (Sep. 13, 2023), https://perma.cc/Y2QW-6HBD. \nMany of the billions injected into the USF have un-\ndoubtedly been deployed to support the important goal \nof universal service.  But waste and fraud have also \ncontributed to the USF\u2019s astronomical growth.  For \nexample, in 2004, FCC\u2019s Inspector General affirmed \nthat schools view the E-Rate Program as \u201ca big candy \njar\u201d of \u201cfree money.\u201d  Sam Dillon, School Internet Pro-\ngram Lacks Oversight, Investigator Says, N.Y. Times \n(June 18, 2004), https://perma.cc/9PZY-ED3K.  The \nInspector General\u2019s primary concern was FCC\u2019s heavy \nand longstanding reliance on self-certified eligibility de-\nterminations in the E-rate Program.  See U.S. GOV\u2019T \nACCOUNTABILITY OFF., GAO-20-606, FCC SHOULD \nTAKE ACTION TO BETTER MANAGE PERSISTENT FRAUD \nRISKS IN THE SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES PROGRAM18 \n(Sep. 2020), https://perma.cc/5EK4-Q8V8 (\u201cFCC\u2019s E-\nrate Program\u201d).  A 2008 GAO report demonstrated \nthat, in a single year, USAC made almost a billion dol-\nlars of High-Cost Program payments that \u201cshould not \nhave been made, or were not made, in the correct \n\n9a \n \namount, when viewed from the perspective of applicable \nFederal Communications Commission rules, orders and \ninterpretative opinions.\u201d  OFF.

In 2013, one Congressman noted: \nThe [Lifeline] fund [] increased 266 percent [between \n2008 and 2013],  . . .  all while the cost of phone \nservice [went] down.  Despite the limit of one subsi-\ndized subscriber per household, published reports \nsuggest some subscribers have eight or more phones \nwith subsidized service, with one woman saying that \nto get one \u201cshe just goes across the street and gets \nit.\u201d  One man has claimed to have a bag full of 20 \nphones on the program that he sells \u201cfor about 10, 15, \n20 bucks\u201d each. \nThe Lifeline Fund:  Money Well Spent?:  Hearing \nBefore the H.

While earth\u2019s only \ntwo certainties are death and taxes, the USF Tax man-\nages to cheat the grave:  It is well-documented that \nFCC disburses USF money to dead people.  See FCC\u2019s \nLIFELINE PROGRAM, supra, at 43. \nUSAC\u2019s role in perpetuating USF waste is equally \nwell known.  In 2010, GAO concluded that USAC \u201clacks \n\n10a \n \nkey features of effective internal controls.\u201d  U.S. GOV\u2019T \nACCOUNTABILITY OFF., GAO-11-11, IMPROVED MAN-\nAGEMENT CAN ENHANCE FCC DECISION MAKING FOR \nTHE UNIVERSAL SERVICE FUND LOW-INCOME PRO-\nGRAM i (Oct. 2010), https://perma.cc/9YHE-8YE9 \n(\u201cFCC\u2019s Low-Income Program\u201d); see also FCC\u2019s E-\nRATE PROGRAM, supra, at 20-21.  The Low-Income \nProgram report noted that while USAC primarily uses \naudit findings to monitor compliance with USF rules, \n\u201cthe number and scope of USAC\u2019s audits have been lim-\nited and there is no systematic process in place to review \nthe findings of those audits that are conducted.\u201d  \nFCC\u2019s LOW-INCOME PROGRAM, supra, at cover page.  \nMoreover, the GAO noted USAC had not even consid-\nered \u201cthe possibility that multiple carriers may claim \nsupport for the same telephone line and that households \nmay receive more than one discount, contrary to pro-\ngram rules.\u201d  Ibid.  In 2017, GAO explained that \nUSAC \u201crelies on over 2,000 Eligible Telecommunication \nCarriers that are Lifeline providers to implement key \nprogram functions, such as verifying subscriber eligibil-\nity,\u201d which is problematic because \u201ccompanies may have \nfinancial incentives to enroll as many customers as pos-\nsible.\u201d  FCC\u2019s LIFELINE PROGRAM, supra, at cover page.  \nAnd in 2019, FCC acknowledged that USAC was out of \ncompliance with improper payment reporting require-\nments.  See Letter from Mark Stephens, supra, at 1. \n* * * \nSection 254 reflects a policy goal of making telecom-\nmunications services available to all Americans.  It is \nemphatically the province of Congress to make such pol-\nicy choices.  But it is our judicial duty to ensure that \nCongress pursued its goal through lawful means.  And \n\n11a \n \nin that regard, our brief survey of the USF\u2019s history \nmakes three things clear.  First, Congress\u2019s instruc-\ntions are so ambiguous that it is unclear whether Amer-\nicans should contribute $1.37 billion, $9 billion, or any \nother sum to pay for universal service.  Second, private \nentities bear important responsibility for universal ser-\nvice policy choices.  And third, it is impossible for an \naggrieved citizen to know who bears responsibility for \nthe USF\u2019s serious waste and fraud problems.  All three \nof those things implicate bedrock constitutional princi-\nples. \nII. \nA. \nOn November 2, 2021, USAC proposed its Q1 2022 \nUSF contribution amount.  A subset of the Petitioners \nin this action filed a comment with FCC challenging the \nconstitutionality of the universal service contribution \nmechanism on November 19.  On December 13, 2021, \nFCC issued a public notice of its Proposed Q1 2022 USF \nTax, which was derived directly from USAC\u2019s proposed \ncontribution amount.  Petitioners re-filed their com-\nment on December 22.  FCC took no action with re-\nspect to USAC\u2019s proposed contribution amount, so on \nDecember 27 the contribution factor was deemed ap-\nproved.  See 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.709(a)(3).  Petitioners \nthen filed a timely petition for review in our court. \nB. \nWe have statutory jurisdiction under 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 402 \nand 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342.2  FCC does not contest our con-\n \n2  Before the panel, FCC argued that we lack statutory jurisdic-\ntion because the petition was not timely filed.  The panel rejected \n \n\n12a \n \nstitutional jurisdiction, but we have an obligation to con-\nsider jurisdictional questions sua sponte even when they \nare not raised by the parties.  See E.T. v. Paxton, 41 \nF.4th 709, 718 n.2 (5th Cir. 2022). \nConsistent with that obligation, we note that at least \none petitioner\u2014Cause Based Commerce\u2014had Article \nIII standing when the petition was filed.  See Biden v. \nNebraska, 143 S. Ct. 2355, 2365 (2023) (\u201cIf at least one \nplaintiff has standing, the suit may proceed.\u201d); Ad-\nvanced Mgmt. Tech., Inc. v. FAA, 211 F.3d 633, 636 \n(D.C. Cir. 2000) (\u201cStanding is assessed at the time the \naction commences.\u201d  (citation and quotation omitted)).  \nCause Based Commerce incurred a classic pocketbook \ninjury as a result of its legal obligation to pay the USF \nTax.  Its injury is fairly traceable to the challenged \nconduct because the size of its Q1 2022 USF liability was \ncontrolled by the contribution factor set by USAC.  \nAnd, at the time the petition was filed, its injury could \nhave been redressed by a favorable judicial decision be-\ncause vacatur of FCC\u2019s approval of the proposed contri-\nbution factor would have prevented collection of the \nUSF Tax.  See 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.709(a)(3) (\u201c[T]he Admin-\nistrator shall apply the quarterly contribution factor, \nonce approved by the Commission, to contributor\u2019s in-\nterstate and international end-user telecommunications \nrevenues to calculate the amount of individual contribu-\ntions.\u201d  (emphasis added)). \n \n \n \nthat argument, see Consumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, 63 F.4th 441, 446 (5th \nCir. 2023), reh\u2019g en banc granted, opinion vacated, 72 F.4th 107 \n(5th Cir. 2023), and FCC has abandoned it. \n\n13a \n \nIt is not clear that Cause Based Commerce\u2019s pocket-\nbook injury is still redressable because sovereign im-\nmunity may bar recovery of the monies it paid into USF \npursuant to the Q1 2022 USF Tax.  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702 \n(waiving sovereign immunity for actions against agen-\ncies seeking relief \u201cother than money damages\u201d).  If \nthat is right, Cause Based Commerce\u2019s challenge might \nbe moot because no court-ordered relief could redress \nthe injuries it incurred as a result of the Q1 2022 USF \nTax.  See Already, LLC v. Nike, Inc., 568 U.S. 85, 91 \n(2013) (\u201cA case becomes moot\u2014and therefore no longer \na \u2018Case\u2019 or \u2018Controversy\u2019 for purposes of Article III\u2014\nwhen the issues presented are no longer live or the par-\nties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.\u201d  \n(quotation and citation omitted)). \nWe need not reach that question, however, because \neven assuming Cause Based Commerce\u2019s injury is no \nlonger redressable, it is nonetheless justiciable because \nit is capable of repetition yet evading review.  See, e.g., \nS. Pac. Terminal Co. v. Interstate Com. Comm\u2019n, 219 \nU.S. 498, 515 (1911) (establishing the exception and not-\ning that jurisdiction \u201cought not to be  . . .  defeated, \nby short term orders, capable of repetition, yet evading \nreview\u201d because otherwise the government and regu-\nlated parties would \u201chave their rights determined by the \nCommission without a chance of [judicial] redress\u201d).  \nThe Q1 2022 USF Tax evades review because it was in \nforce for just one quarter\u2014\u201ctoo short [a] duration to be \nfully litigated in the United States Supreme Court be-\nfore it expire[d].\u201d  Ralls Corp. v. Comm. on Foreign \nInv. in U.S., 758 F.3d 296, 321 (D.C. Cir. 2014); see ibid. \n(\u201cAs a rule of thumb, agency actions of less than two \nyears\u2019 duration cannot be fully litigated prior to cessa-\ntion or expiration, so long as the short duration is typical \n\n14a \n \nof the challenged action.\u201d (quotation and citation omit-\nted)).  And it is capable of repetition because there is \n\u201ca reasonable expectation\u201d\u2014indeed, a near certainty\u2014\n\u201cthat [Cause Based Commerce] will be subjected to the \nsame action again.\u201d  Id. at 323; see id. at 324 (\u201cThe \nsame action generally refers to  . . .  recurrent iden-\ntical agency actions.\u201d (quotation and citations omitted)); \nsee also 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.709(a)(3) (providing that a new \ncontribution factor is calculated each quarter). \nAccordingly, we have jurisdiction to decide the mer-\nits of petitioners\u2019 constitutional claims. \nC. \nWe must decide one more threshold issue.  On June \n17, 2024, FCC filed a motion to dismiss on the that \nground issue preclusion bars the petition for review.  \nIn FCC\u2019s view, that is because petitioners raised identi-\ncal challenges to different USF quarterly contribution \nfactors in the Sixth and Eleventh Circuits, and those \ncourts rejected petitioners\u2019 arguments.  But even if \nthere were something to FCC\u2019s issue preclusion argu-\nment, it fails because FCC forfeited it. \n\u201c[I]ssue preclusion[] is an affirmative defense.\u201d  Tay-\nlor v. Sturgell, 553 U.S. 880, 907 (2008).  That means \nthe party asserting preclusion ordinarily must timely \nraise it.  Ibid.; see 18A CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT, AR-\nTHUR R. MILLER, & EDWARD H. COOPER, FEDERAL \nPRACTICE & PROCEDURE \u00a7 4405 (3d ed. 2017).  Where, \nas here, an allegedly preclusive judgment is rendered \nafter suit is filed, the party \u201cwishing to raise [preclusion] \nis obliged to assert it at the earliest moment practica-\nble.\u201d  Home Depot, Inc. v. Guste, 773 F.2d 616, 620 n.4 \n(5th Cir. 1985); see Evans v. Syracuse City Sch. Dist., \n\n15a \n \n704 F.2d 44, 47 (2d Cir. 1983) (\u201c[T]he party wishing to \nraise [preclusion as a] defense is obliged to plead it at \nthe earliest possible moment.\u201d  (quotation omitted)); \nAetna Cas. & Sur. Co. v. Gen. Dynamics Corp., 968 F.2d \n707, 711 (8th Cir. 1992) (issue preclusion must be raised \n\u201cat the first reasonable opportunity after the rendering \nof the decision having the preclusive effect\u201d); Davignon \nv. Clemmey, 322 F.3d 1, 15 (1st Cir. 2003) (holding that \ndistrict court abused its discretion by allowing defend-\nant to assert preclusion defense \u201cat the eleventh hour\u201d); \nGeorgia Pac. Consumer Prod., LP v. Von Drehle Corp., \n710 F.3d 527, 533 (4th Cir. 2013) (\u201cEven when a preclu-\nsion defense is not available at the outset of a case, a \nparty may waive such a defense arising during the \ncourse of litigation by waiting too long to assert the de-\nfense after it becomes available.\u201d); Arizona v. Califor-\nnia, 530 U.S. 392, 413 (2000) (holding that party could \nnot raise preclusion as a defense when party could have \nraised the defense earlier in the proceedings but did not, \n\u201cdespite ample opportunity and cause to do so\u201d). \nThat makes sense.  The policy underlying issue pre-\nclusion is based primarily on a \u201cdefendant\u2019s interest in \navoiding the burdens of twice defending a suit\u201d and \u201cthe \navoidance of unnecessary judicial waste.\u201d  Arizona, \n530 U.S. at 412 (quoting United States v. Sioux Nation, \n448 U.S. 371, 432 (1980) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting)).  \nIssue preclusion cannot serve either of those purposes if \nit is raised in the eleventh hour of proceedings, after the \ndefendant and the court have already carried all the bur-\ndens necessary to decide the case.  So even assuming \nFCC could defeat petitioners\u2019 claims on the ground the \nSixth and the Eleventh Circuits have rendered preclu-\nsive judgments, FCC was obliged to raise that issue \u201cat \n\n16a \n \nthe earliest moment practicable.\u201d  Guste, 773 F.2d at \n620 n.4. \nIt did not.  The first allegedly preclusive judgment \nFCC cites is the Sixth Circuit\u2019s judgment in Consumers\u2019 \nResearch v. FCC.  See 67 F.4th 773 (6th Cir. 2023), cert. \ndenied Consumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, No. 23-456, 2024 WL \n2883753 (U.S. June 10, 2024). That judgment bound six \nof the named petitioners in this case.3  And it was final \non June 7, 2023.  See Mandate Issued, Consumers\u2019 Rsch., \n67 F.4th 773 (No. 21-3886) (Jun. 7, 2023).  True, the pe-\ntitioners sought certiorari in that case.  But \u201cthe gen-\neral rule in American jurisprudence [is] that a final \njudgment of a court  . . .  can be given [preclusive] ef-\nfect even while an appeal is pending.\u201d  Prymer v. Og-\nden, 29 F.3d 1208, 1213 n.2 (7th Cir. 1994); see WRIGHT \n& MILLER, supra, \u00a7 4433 (\u201c[I]t is  . . .  held in federal \ncourts that the preclusive effects of a lower court judg-\nment cannot be suspended simply by taking an appeal \nthat remains undecided.\u201d); RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF \nJUDGMENTS \u00a7 13, cmt. f (explaining a \u201cjudgment other-\nwise final\u201d for purposes of the law of res judicata should \n\u201cremain[] so despite the taking of an appeal\u201d). \nThat means FCC could have asserted preclusion \nagainst six petitioners on June 7, 2023.  At the very \nleast, FCC could have raised preclusion in its supple-\nmental brief, which it filed on August 30, 2023.  But \nFCC did not do so.  Instead, it waited more than a year \nand then filed a tardy motion to dismiss at the eleventh \nhour.  FCC therefore forfeited its preclusion defense \n \n3  Consumers\u2019 Research, Cause Based Commerce, Deanna Roth, \nJeremy Roth, Joseph Bayly, Lynn Gibbs, and Paul Gibbs. \n\n17a \n \nwith respect to at least six petitioners.4  So there is no \ndoubt we may proceed to the merits of those petitioners\u2019 \nclaims. \nFCC also cites the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s judgment in \nConsumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, 88 F.4th 917, 923 (11th Cir. \n2023), cert. denied Consumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, No. 23-743, \n2024 WL 2883755 (U.S. June 10, 2024).  That judgment \nbound all the petitioners in this case, including the six \nwho were parties to the Sixth Circuit proceeding. But \nthat another allegedly preclusive judgment was ren-\ndered during the course of this proceeding does not \nchange the fact that FCC had a purported preclusion \ndefense against six petitioners as of June 7, 2023.  And \neven if the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s judgment somehow gave \nFCC a new window to raise a preclusion defense against \nthose petitioners, the window closed before FCC raised \nit.  The Eleventh Circuit\u2019s judgment was final (and \ntherefore had preclusive effect) on February 5, 2024.  \nSee Mandate Issued, Consumers\u2019 Research v. FCC, 88 \nF.4th 917 (No. 22-13315) (Feb. 5, 2024).  FCC nonethe-\nless waited to file a motion to dismiss on the basis of that \njudgment until June 17, 2024\u2014more than four months \nlater. \nThere may sometimes be ambiguity about whether a \ndefendant carried its obligation to raise a preclusion de-\nfense \u201cat the earliest moment practicable.\u201d  Guste, 773 \nF.2d at 620 n.4.  But this is not a close case.  Litigants \nordinarily have 21 days to plead an affirmative defense.  \nSee FED. R. CIV. P. 12(a)(1)(A)(ii); see also WRIGHT & \nMILLER, supra, \u00a7 1394 (noting affirmative defenses are \n \n4  Including Cause Based Commerce, who certainly has standing.  \nSee supra, at 11. \n\n18a \n \nforfeited if they are not raised in responsive pleadings). \nThere is no reason a party should have six times that \nmany days to raise an affirmative defense to a petition \nfor review. So even if we thought FCC could have as-\nserted preclusion against all the petitioners within a rea-\nsonable time after the Eleventh Circuit rendered judg-\nment, we would hold FCC failed to do so. \nIn sum, FCC forfeited any preclusion defense.  \nTrue, we have discretion to forgive a forfeiture in \u201cex-\ntraordinary circumstances\u201d\u2014as where \u201ca miscarriage \nof justice would result from our failure to consider\u201d the \nforfeited argument.  See, e.g., AG Acceptance Corp. v. \nVeigel, 564 F.3d 695, 700 (5th Cir. 2009).  But FCC does \nnot supply any reason to think a miscarriage of justice \nwould result from our reaching the merits of petitioners\u2019 \nclaims.  See ibid. (explaining the burden of establishing \nextraordinary circumstances is on the party seeking re-\nview).  And we cannot think of one.  In fact, if we do \nnot decide the constitutional questions presented in this \ncase, we will have to decide them in a pending challenge \nthat includes petitioners who were not parties to the \nSixth or Eleventh Circuit proceedings.  See Petition \nfor Review, Consumers\u2019 Research v. FCC, No. 24-60330 \n(5th Cir. Jun. 27, 2024).  It effects no injustice to hold \nFCC to its forfeiture.5 \n \n5  FCC convinced the Supreme Court to deny certiorari in the \nSixth and Eleventh Circuit cases in part by explaining the Court \nwould have another chance to consider the constitutionality of the \nUSF after this court\u2019s en banc ruling.  See Br. in Opp\u2019n 17-18, \nConsumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, Nos. 23-456, 23-743 (U.S. May 3, 2024) \n(\u201c[T]he en banc Fifth Circuit has not yet issued its decision in that \ncase.  Once it does so, the parties can determine whether to seek, \nand this Court can determine whether to grant, certiorari to review \n \n\n19a \n \n* * * \nWe therefore proceed to the merits. Our review is de \nnovo.  See Huwaei Tech. USA, Inc. v. FCC, 2 F.4th 421, \n434 (5th Cir. 2021). \nIII. \nPetitioners contend the universal service contribu-\ntion mechanism violates the Legislative Vesting Clause.  \nSee U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 1 (\u201cAll legislative Powers herein \ngranted shall be vested in a Congress of the United \nStates, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Rep-\nresentatives.\u201d).  We agree.  We (A) explain that the \npower to levy USF \u201ccontributions\u201d is the power to tax\u2014\na quintessentially legislative power.  Then we (B) ex-\nplain that Congress through 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254 may have \ndelegated legislative power to FCC because it pur-\nported to confer upon FCC the power to tax without sup-\nplying an intelligible principle to guide FCC\u2019s discre-\ntion.  Next, we (C) explain that FCC may have imper-\nmissibly delegated the taxing power to private entities.  \nFinally, we (D) explain that we need not definitively an-\nswer either delegation question because even if \u00a7 254 \ncontains an intelligible principle, and even if FCC was \npermitted to enlist private entities to determine how \nmuch universal service tax revenue it should raise, the \ncombination of Congress\u2019s broad delegation to FCC and \nFCC\u2019s subdelegation to private entities certainly amounts \nto a constitutional violation. \n \nthat decision.\u201d).  Had FCC told the Supreme Court it thought pe-\ntitioners\u2019 claims in this court were issue precluded, the Court might \nhave granted certiorari in those other cases.  It would be unjust \nto allow FCC to raise an issue to evade en banc review so soon after \nit hid that issue to evade Supreme Court review. \n\n20a \n \nA. \nSection 254(d) provides that \u201c[e]very telecommunica-\ntions carrier that provides interstate telecommunica-\ntions services shall contribute, on an equitable and non-\ndiscriminatory basis, to the specific, predictable, and \nsufficient mechanisms established by the Commission  \nto preserve and advance universal service.\u201d  47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(d).  Pursuant to this authority, FCC mandates \nthat \u201ctelecommunications carriers  . . .  must con-\ntribute to the universal service support mechanisms.\u201d  \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.706(a).  USAC determines carriers\u2019 \nUSF contribution obligations on a quarterly basis by \n\u201capply[ing] the quarterly contribution factor  . . .  to \n[each carriers\u2019] interstate and  international  end-user  \ntelecommunications  revenues.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 54.709(a)(3).  \nThe result is a USAC-fashioned USF Tax. \nFCC\u2019s principal defense of the USF scheme is that \nthe USF Tax is not really a tax at all.  Rather, FCC \ncontends, it is a fee.  That is because, FCC reasons, a \nfee is a charge that \u201cbestows a benefit on the [payor], \nnot shared by other members of society.\u201d  Nat\u2019l Cable \nTelevision Ass\u2019n v. United States, 415 U.S. 336, 341 \n(1974).  And FCC thinks universal service contribu-\ntions comport with that definition because telecommuni-\ncations carriers pay them, and because they are used to \nfund the universal service program, which \u201cconfers spe-\ncial benefits on contributing carriers by (among other \nthings) expanding the network such carriers can serve.\u201d \nFCC EB Br. 51. \nBut FCC misunderstands the nature of the inquiry. \nA fee has three characteristics:  First, fees are in-\ncurred \u201cincident to a voluntary act.\u201d  Nat\u2019l Cable, 415 \nU.S. at 341; see also Krotoszynski, Jr., Reconsidering \n\n21a \n \nthe Nondelegation Doctrine, supra, at 270 (\u201cA \u2018fee\u2019 con-\nstitutes a charge that an agency exacts in return for a \nbenefit voluntarily sought by the payer.\u201d).  For exam-\nple, \u201c[a] public agency might charge a user fee to visit a \npublic park, tour a museum, or enter a toll road.\u201d  \nTrafigura Trading LLC v. United States, 29 F.4th 286, \n293 (5th Cir. 2022) (Opinion of Ho, J.); see also ibid. (not-\ning that fees \u201carise in the context of value-for-value trans-\nactions\u201d between individuals and government).  The \ngovernment may also charge fees designed to defray the \ncost of providing benefits to a regulated party, but only \nif the fees charged represent a \u201cfair approximation of \nservices, facilities, or benefits furnished.\u201d  United \nStates v. U.S. Shoe Corp., 523 U.S. 360, 363 (1998).  \nSecond, a fee generally is \u201cimposed by an administrative \nagency upon only those persons, or entities, subject to \nits regulation for regulatory purposes.\u201d  Valero Ter-\nrestrial Corp. v. Caffrey, 205 F.3d 130, 134 (4th Cir. \n2000).  And third, the revenue the government raises \nthrough its collection of fees is used to supply benefits \ninuring to the persons or entities paying them rather \nthan to the public generally.  See Skinner v. Mid-Am. \nPipeline Co., 490 U.S. 212, 223 (1989) (quoting Nat\u2019l Ca-\nble, 415 U.S. at 343). \nUniversal service contributions do not have any of \nthese characteristics.  First, they are not incident to a \nvoluntary act but rather are a condition of doing busi-\nness in the telecommunications industry.  See 47 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 254(d).  Nor do they represent a fair approxi-\nmation of the benefits conferred by government regula-\ntion on telecommunications carriers.  In fact, they are \nnot related to regulatory costs at all.  They are de-\nsigned to fund telecommunications subsidies to schools, \nlibraries, healthcare facilities, and low-income individu-\n\n22a \n \nals.  Second, the cost of universal service contributions \nis not borne by parties FCC regulates. While FCC for-\nmally imposes the charges on telecommunications carri-\ners, carriers overwhelmingly pass the cost of contribu-\ntions on to consumers, as is expressly permitted by FCC \nregulation.  See FCC, REPORT TO CONGRESS, supra, at \n45-46; 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.712(a).  So the cost of universal \nservice contributions is widely shared by the population \nin a manner reminiscent of a \u201cclassic tax.\u201d  See Valero, \n205 F.3d at 134 (\u201cThe \u2018classic tax\u2019 is imposed by the leg-\nislature upon a large segment of society.\u201d).  And third, \nthe benefits associated with universal service contribu-\ntions \u201cinure to the benefit of the public\u201d\u2014or more accu-\nrately to the benefit of those fortunate enough to receive \nsubsidies from USAC\u2014rather than to the benefit of the \npersons who pay them.  Skinner, 490 U.S. at 223 (quot-\ning Nat\u2019l Cable, 415 U.S. at 343).  There is no overlap \nat all between the class of USF beneficiaries (recipients \nof subsidized telecommunications services) and the class \nof USF contributors (American telecommunications \nconsumers who see USF charges on their phone bills \neach month). \nThink about the consequences of FCC\u2019s position: \n\u2022 Congress could fund Medicare and Medicaid with-\nout \u201ctaxing\u201d anyone.  It could simply allow hospi-\ntal executives to set the Medicare-Medicaid budget, \nthen have HHS rubber-stamp the hospitals\u2019 health-\ncare taxes, which could then be passed through to \nconsumers\u2019 hospital bills. \n\u2022 Congress could fund the Supplemental Nutrition \nAssistance Program (\u201cSNAP\u201d) without \u201ctaxing\u201d \nanyone.  It could simply allow grocery store exec-\nutives to set the SNAP budget, then have USDA \n\n23a \n \nrubber-stamp the grocers\u2019 SNAP taxes, which \ncould then be passed through to consumers at the \ncheckout register. \n\u2022 Congress could fund affordable housing without \n\u201ctaxing\u201d anyone.  It could simply allow real estate \ncompanies to set the affordable housing budget, \nthen have HUD rubber-stamp the companies  \naffordable-housing taxes, which could then be \npassed through to consumers as new line items at \nclosing or in monthly surcharges for rent. \nWe could go on.  But you get the point:  All of these \nare obviously taxes.  So while \u201c[d]istinguishing a tax \nfrom a fee often is a difficult task,\u201d Tex. Ent. Ass\u2019n, Inc. \nv. Hegar, 10 F.4th 495, 505 (5th Cir. 2021) (citation omit-\nted), the analysis here is straightforward.  Congress \nhas bestowed upon FCC the power to levy taxes, and we \naccordingly conclude that it has delegated its taxing \npower.6 \nB. \nIn \u00a7 254 of the Telecommunications Act, Congress \ndelegated its taxing power to FCC.  The power to tax \nis a quintessentially legislative one.  See U.S. CONST. \nart. 1, \u00a7 8, cl. 1; see also Nat\u2019l Cable, 415 U.S. at 340 \n(\u201cTaxation is a legislative function, and Congress  . . .  \nis the sole organ for levying taxes.\u201d); MICHAEL W. \nMCCONNELL, THE PRESIDENT WHO WOULD NOT BE \n \n6  The fact that Congress euphemistically labeled these universal \nservice charges \u201ccontribution[s],\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(d), is irrelevant.  \n\u201cCongress cannot change whether an exaction is a tax  . . .  for \nconstitutional purposes simply by\u201d relabeling it.  Nat\u2019l Fed\u2019n of \nIndep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 544 (2012) (emphasis in orig-\ninal). \n\n24a \n \nKING 334 (2020) (noting that domestic taxation is \u201cespe-\ncially central to the legislative branch\u201d).  So \u00a7 254 is \nconstitutional only if it passes nondelegation muster.  \nWe (1) explain the nondelegation doctrine as articulated \nby the Supreme Court. Then we (2) explain the breadth \nof Congress\u2019s delegation to FCC.  Lastly, we (3) ex-\nplain that the Supreme Court has never upheld a dele-\ngation of core legislative power as sweeping as the one \ncontained in \u00a7 254. \nThe Constitution vests \u201c[a]ll legislative Powers \nherein granted\u201d \u201c in a Congress of the United States.\u201d  \nU.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 1.  \u201cAccompanying that assign-\nment of power to Congress is a bar on its further dele-\ngation.\u201d Gundy v. United States, 588 U.S. 128, 135 \n(2019) (plurality op.). Moreover, \u201cthe principle of sepa-\nration of powers that underlies our tripartite system of \nGovernment\u201d independently compels the conclusion \nthat Congress, not agencies, must make legislative deci-\nsions.  Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 371 \n(1989); see Gundy, 588 U.S. at 153 (Gorsuch, J., dissent-\ning) (\u201c[I]t would frustrate the system of government or-\ndained by the Constitution if Congress could merely an-\nnounce vague aspirations and then assign others the re-\nsponsibility of adopting legislation to realize its goals.\u201d \n(quotation omitted)).  So there is no doubt that \u201cthe \nlawmaking function belongs to Congress,\u201d Loving v. \nUnited States, 517 U.S. 748, 758 (1996), and that Con-\ngress \u201cmay not constitutionally delegate that power to \nanother\u201d constitutional actor, Touby v. United States, \n500 U.S. 160, 165 (1991). \nBut \u201c[t]he Constitution has never been regarded as \ndenying to the Congress the necessary resources of flex-\nibility and practicality, which will enable it to perform \n\n25a \n \nits function.\u201d  Panama Refin. Co. v. Ryan, 293 U.S. \n388, 421 (1935).  So the Supreme Court has held that \ndelegations are constitutional so long as Congress \n\u201clay[s] down by legislative act an intelligible principle to \nwhich the person or body authorized [to exercise the del-\negated authority] is directed to conform.\u201d  J.W. Hamp-\nton, Jr., & Co. v. United States, 276 U.S. 394, 409 (1928). \nStill, \u201cthere are limits of delegation which there is no \nconstitutional authority to transcend.\u201d  Panama Re-\nfin., 293 U.S. at 430.  And for good reason.  Vague \ncongressional delegations undermine representative \ngovernment because they give unelected bureaucrats\u2014\nrather than elected representatives\u2014the final say over \nmatters that affect the lives, liberty, and property of \nAmericans.  See Tiger Lily, LLC v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Hous. \n& Urb. Dev., 5 F.4th 666, 674 (6th Cir. 2021) (Thapar, J., \nconcurring) (\u201cBy shifting responsibility to a less ac-\ncountable branch, Congress  . . .  deprives the people \nof the say the framers intended them to have.\u201d).  \nOverly broad delegations also obscure accountability:  \nWhen elected representatives shirk hard choices, con-\nstituents do not know whom to hold accountable for gov-\nernment action.  See Gundy, 588 U.S. at 156 (Gorsuch, \nJ., dissenting).  And they offend the deliberation- \nforcing features of the constitutionally prescribed legis-\nlative process.  See U.S. CONST. art. I, \u00a7 7; John Man-\nning, Lawmaking Made Easy, 10 GREEN BAG 2d 191, \n202 (2007) (\u201c[B]icameralism and presentment make law-\nmaking difficult by design.\u201d  (emphasis in original)); \nsee also THE FEDERALIST No. 73 (A. Hamilton) (noting \nthat the Constitution prescribed elaborate procedures \nfor lawmaking because \u201c[t]he oftener the measure is \nbrought under examination, the greater the diversity in \nthe situations of those who are to examine it, the less \n\n26a \n \nmust be the danger of those errors which flow from want \nof due deliberation, or of those missteps which proceed \nfrom the contagion of some common passion or inter-\nest.\u201d). \nSo while \u201cthe Supreme Court has not in the past sev-\neral decades held that Congress failed to provide a req-\nuisite intelligible principle,\u201d Jarkesy v. SEC, 34 F.4th \n446, 462 (5th Cir. 2022), aff\u200a\u2019d on other grounds, 144 S. \nCt. 2117 (2024), \u201c[t]hat does not mean  . . .  we must \nrubber-stamp all delegations of legislative power,\u201d Big \nTime Vapes, Inc. v. FDA., 963 F.3d 436, 443 (5th Cir. \n2020).  Rather, \u201c[w]e ought not to shy away from our \njudicial duty to invalidate unconstitutional delegations.\u201d  \nIbid.  (quotation omitted). \n2. \nNondelegation inquiries \u201calways begin[]  . . .  \nwith statutory interpretation\u201d because the constitu-\ntional question is whether Congress has supplied a suf-\nficiently intelligible principle to guide an agency\u2019s dis-\ncretion.  Gundy, 588 U.S. at 135 (plurality op.).  So we \nmust construe \u201cthe challenged statute to figure out what \ntask it delegates and what instructions it provides.\u201d  \nId. at 136.  Petitioners challenge the USF\u2019s funding \nmechanism, so we must consider whether 47 U.S.C.  \n\u00a7 254 sufficiently instructs FCC regarding how much it \nshould tax Americans to pay for the universal service \nprogram. \nTwo of \u00a7 254\u2019s subsections are relevant:  \u00a7 254(d) \nprovides that USF funding should be \u201csufficient  . . .  \nto preserve and advance universal service,\u201d and \u00a7 254(b)(1) \nsuggests that telecommunications services \u201cshould be \navailable at  . . .  affordable rates.\u201d \n\n27a \n \nThese statutory phrases supply no principle at all. \nStart with sufficiency.  That funding should be \u201csuffi-\ncient  . . .  to preserve and advance universal ser-\nvice\u201d is meaningful only if the concept of universal ser-\nvice is sufficiently intelligible.  It is not.  Rather, uni-\nversal service is \u201can evolving level of telecommunica-\ntions services that the Commission shall establish peri-\nodically\u201d by determining what telecommunications ser-\nvices are \u201cessential to education, public health, or public \nsafety\u201d; are \u201csubscribed to by a substantial majority of \nresidential customers\u201d; are \u201cdeployed  . . .  by tele-\ncommunications carriers\u201d; or are otherwise \u201cconsistent \nwith the public interest, convenience, and necessity.\u201d  \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(c).  That is a lot of words, but they \namount to a concept of universal service so amorphous \nthat Congress\u2019s instruction to raise \u201csufficient\u201d funds \namounts to a suggestion that FCC exact as much tax \nrevenue for universal service projects as FCC thinks is \ngood.  Cf. Gary Lawson, Delegation and Original Mean-\ning, 88 VA. L. REV. 327, 339-40 (2002) (describing conse-\nquences of congressional enactment that requires \n\u201c\u200a\u2018goodness and niceness\u2019\u200a\u201d). \nThat \u00a7 254(b) supplies minimal guidance on the con-\ntours of Congress\u2019s idea of an ideal universal service pol-\nicy is no answer.  That is for three reasons.  First, we \nhave previously accepted FCC\u2019s contention that \u201cnoth-\ning in [\u00a7 254] defines \u2018sufficient\u2019 to mean that universal \nservice support must equal the actual costs incurred by\u201d \ntelecommunications carriers contributing to the USF.  \nTOPUC I, 183 F.3d at 412.  So FCC\u2019s universal service \ntaxation is not formally limited by the amount it dis-\nburses on universal service projects.  Nothing in the \nstatute precludes FCC from, for example, imposing the \nUSF Tax to create an endowment that it could use to \n\n28a \n \nfund whatever projects it might like.  FCC has never \ndone so, but the fact \u201cthat the recipients of illicitly dele-\ngated authority opted not to make use of it is no anti-\ndote.  It is Congress\u2019s decision to delegate that is un-\nconstitutional.\u201d  Dep\u2019t of Transp. v. Ass\u2019n of Am. Rail-\nroads (\u201cAmtrak II\u201d), 575 U.S. 43, 62 (2015) (Alito, J., \nconcurring) (emphasis in original) (quotation omitted) \n(quoting Ass\u2019n of Am. Railroads v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Transp. \n(\u201cAmtrak I\u201d), 721 F.3d 666, 674 (D.C. Cir. 2013), vacated \nand remanded sub nom. Amtrak II, 575 U.S. 43); see \nWhitman v. Am. Trucking Ass\u2019n, 531 U.S. 457, 472 \n(2001) (\u201cWe have never suggested that an agency can \ncure an unlawful delegation of legislative power by \nadopting in its discretion a limiting construction of the \nstatute.\u201d). \nSecond, even if FCC\u2019s power to levy taxes were lim-\nited by the amount it disburses on universal service pro-\njects, subsection (b) still would not curb FCC\u2019s discre-\ntion because we have explained it sets out \u201caspirational\u201d \nprinciples rather than \u201cinexorable statutory com-\nmand[s].\u201d  TOPUC I, 183 F.3d at 421; see also Tex. Off. \nof Pub. Util. Couns. v. FCC, 265 F.3d 313, 321 (5th Cir. \n2001).  And even if the principles in subsection (b) were \nmore than aspirational, they still would not meaning-\nfully limit FCC because \u00a7 254(b)(7) vests FCC with dis-\ncretion to formulate \u201cother principles\u201d so long as it con-\nsiders the additional principles to be \u201cnecessary and ap-\npropriate for the protection of the public interest, con-\nvenience, and necessity and  . . .  consistent with\u201d \nthe rest of Chapter 5 of Title 47 of the United States \nCode.  In other words, FCC \u201cmay roam at will,\u201d A.L.A. \nSchechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495, \n538 (1935), disregarding \u00a7 254(b)\u2019s enumerated princi-\nples altogether when it thinks the \u201cpublic interest\u201d  \n\n29a \n \nwarrants the journey.  47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(c)(1)(D); id.  \n\u00a7 254(b)(7). \nThird, even if the principles in \u00a7 254(b) in some way \nbind FCC, they are contentless in important respects. \nFor example, \u00a7 254(b)(6) suggests that \u201c[e]lementary \nand secondary schools and classrooms  . . .  and li-\nbraries should have access to advanced telecommunica-\ntions services as described in subsection (h).\u201d  But sub-\nsection (h) says only that \u201celementary schools, second-\nary schools, and libraries\u201d should have access to tele-\ncommunications services \u201cfor educational purposes at \nrates less than the amounts charged for similar services \nto other parties.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 254(h)(1)(B).  Which services?  \nPresumably those FCC thinks are \u201cessential to educa-\ntion\u201d or otherwise within the ambit of its self-defined \nuniversal service utopia.  Id. \u00a7 254(c).  But how is \nFCC to make that determination?  And which schools \nand libraries should receive subsidized services?  And \nhow much less should they pay? \nCongress never said.  FCC has answered some of \nthese questions, see 47 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 54.501, .502, .505, but \nit remains a mystery how we are supposed to \u201cascertain \nwhether the will of Congress has been obeyed.\u201d  Mis-\ntretta, 488 U.S. at 379 (citation omitted).  Each of the \n\u201caspirational\u201d universal service principles in \u00a7 254(b) & \n(c) is inapposite.7  So apparently your guess is as good \n \n7  Section 254(c)(1)(B) suggests low-income consumers should \nhave access to telecommunications services comparable to those \nsubscribed to by unsubsidized residential customers.  And \u00a7 254(b)(3) \ntells FCC to make telecommunications services available in rural \nareas at rates comparable to those charged in urban areas.  Those \nprovisions may supply sufficient guidance for FCC to execute cer-\ntain aspects of the universal service program.  But nothing in the \n \n\n30a \n \nas ours is as good as FCC\u2019s is as good as any random \nAmerican taxpayer\u2019s. And funding for schools and li-\nbraries is not merely an interstitial gap in the statutory \nscheme.  It constituted more than a third of the contri-\nbution amount that gave rise to these proceedings. See \nJA.101.8 \nSo if \u00a7 254(b) binds at all, it is apparent that the only \nreal constraint on FCC\u2019s discretion to levy excise taxes \non telecommunications carriers (and American consum-\ners in turn) is that rates \u201cshould\u201d remain \u201caffordable.\u201d  \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(b)(1); see Consumers\u2019 Rsch., 67 F.4th at \n794 (\u201c[E]xcess subsidization in some cases may detract \nfrom universal service by causing rates unnecessarily to \nrise, thereby pricing some consumers out of the mar-\nket.\u201d  (citation omitted)).  But saying telecommunica-\ntions services \u201cshould\u201d remain \u201caffordable\u201d amounts to \n\u201cno guidance whatsoever.\u201d  Jarkesy, 34 F.4th at 462 \n(emphasis in original).  How is FCC to determine \nwhether the USF Tax it mandates has made telecommu-\nnications services unaffordable?  The demand for cell \nphones is uncommonly inelastic because cell phones are \n \nstatute remotely suggests FCC should provide universal service \nfunding only to low-income or rural schools.  So \u00a7\u00a7 (b)(3) and \n(c)(1)(B) cannot supply the limiting principle that \u00a7 (h)(1)(B) lacks. \nAnd the fact that FCC has limited universal service funding to low-\nincome schools is, once again, irrelevant.  See Am. Trucking, 531 \nU.S. at 472.  The question is whether the statute itself in any way \nlimits FCC\u2019s discretion to supply universal service funding for ed-\nucational programs, and it plainly does not. \n8  Both dissenting opinions contend 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254 is loaded with \nintelligible principles.  See post, at 77-82 (Stewart, J., dissenting); \nid. at 101-02 (Higginson, J., dissenting).  But neither identifies \nany principle that might guide FCC in determining how much less \nschools and libraries should pay for telecommunications services. \n\n31a \n \nessential to participation in the modern world.  See \nCarpenter v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 2206, 2220 (2018) \n(\u201c[C]ell phones and the services they provide are such a \npervasive and insistent part of daily life that carrying \none is indispensable to participation in modern society.\u201d  \n(citation and quotation omitted)).  That means the \nFCC could impose eye-watering USF Taxes while also \narguing with a straight face that cell phones remain \u201caf-\nfordable\u201d in the sense that most Americans would choose \nto keep using them.  And that means \u00a7 254 leaves FCC \n\u2014and as importantly reviewing courts9\u2014utterly at sea.  \nIs a 25% excise tax excessively burdensome under  \n\u00a7 254(b)(1)?  250%?  2500%?  There are no answers \nbecause Congress never gave them. \nFinally, the breadth of \u00a7 254\u2019s delegation is especially \ntroubling because the statute insulates FCC from the \nprincipal tool Congress has to control FCC\u2019s universal \nservice decisions\u2014the appropriations power.  See U.S. \nConst. art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 7 (\u201cNo Money shall be drawn from \nthe Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations \nmade by Law.\u201d).  Ordinarily, when Congress delegates \nbroadly, it retains a residuum of control over agency ac-\ntion because the agency is powerless to act without a \ncongressional appropriation of funds.  See CFPB v. All \nAm. Check Cashing, Inc., 33 F.4th 218, 232 (5th Cir. \n2022) (Jones, J., concurring) (\u201cCongress\u2019s supremacy in \nfiscal matters makes the executive branch dependent on \nthe legislative branch for subsistence, thereby forging a \n \n9  See Mistretta, 488 U.S. at 379 (noting courts are \u201cjustified\u201d in \ninvalidating delegations where it would be \u201cimpossible in a proper \nproceeding to ascertain whether the will of Congress has been \nobeyed\u201d) (quoting Yakus v. United States, 321 U.S. 414, 425-26 \n(1944)). \n\n32a \n \nvital line of accountability between the executive branch \nand the legislative branch and, therefore, the people.  \nRecent history confirms that Congress\u2019s appropriations \npowers have proven a forcible lever of accountability: \nCongress has tightened the purse strings to express dis-\npleasure with an agency\u2019s nefarious activities and even \nto end armed combat.\u201d).  So even when statutes vest \nagencies with significant discretion, the appropriations \nprocess generally ensures agencies remain subservient \nto the will of the people as expressed through their elec-\nted representatives.  See Jonathan H. Adler & Chris-\ntopher J. Walker, Delegation and Time, 105 IOWA L. \nREV. 1931, 1957 (2020) (cataloguing examples and noting \nthat \u201c[l]imiting appropriations is an effective way to \nlimit an agency\u2019s exercise of delegated power\u201d). \nHere, though, Congress cannot exercise control by \nlimiting appropriations because the whole point of USF \nis to fund universal service outside the regular appro-\npriations process.10  And since FCC commissioners are \n \n10 FCC has concluded that 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254 constitutes \u201ca perma-\nnent indefinite appropriation.\u201d  GAO-05-151, GREATER INVOLVE-\nMENT NEEDED BY FCC IN THE MANAGEMENT AND OVERSIGHT OF \nTHE E-RATE PROGRAM 11 (2005), https://perma.cc/QNU6-YEFS.  \nIf we had to decide whether \u00a7 254 comports with the Appropria-\ntions Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 1, cl. 9, we would apply the Su-\npreme Court\u2019s decision in CFPB v. Cmty. Fin. Servs. Ass\u2019n of Am., \nLtd., 601 U.S. 416 (2024).  But we need not decide that question \nbecause Petitioners did not formally raise an Appropriations \nClause challenge.  Our point is only that, to the extent Congress\u2019s \nability to control agencies through regular appropriations supplies \nsome justification for broad delegations, see, e.g., Christopher J. \nWalker, Restoring Congress\u2019s Role in the Modern Administrative \nState, 116 MICH. L. REV. 1101, 1116 (2018) (explaining the tools \nCongress has, including the appropriations power, \u201cto rein in the \nadministrative state and prevent federal agencies from abusing \n \n\n33a \n \nremovable by the President only for-cause, see 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 154(c)(1)(A), the connection between FCC policy deci-\nsions made pursuant to \u00a7 254 and any democratically ac-\ncountable federal official is extremely attenuated. \n3. \nThe Supreme Court has \u201cover and over upheld even \nvery broad delegations.\u201d  Gundy, 588 U.S. at 146 (plu-\nrality op.).  But it has also suggested the scope of per-\nmissible delegation varies with context.  See Am. Truck-\ning, 531 U.S. at 475 (\u201c[T]he degree of agency discretion \nthat is acceptable varies according to the scope of the \npower congressionally conferred.\u201d); J.W. Hampton, 276 \nU.S. at 406 (\u201cIn determining what [Congress] may do in \nseeking assistance from another branch, the extent and \ncharacter of that assistence [sic] must be fixed accord-\ning to common sense and the inherent necessities of the \ngovernmental co-ordination.\u201d); Loving, 517 U.S. at 768 \n(noting the general rule that \u201ca constitutional power im-\nplies a power of delegation of authority under it suffi-\ncient to effect its purposes\u201d (emphasis added)) (quoting \nLichter v. United States, 334 U.S. 742, 778 (1948)); \nLichter, 334 U.S. at 778-79 (suggesting Congress may \ndelegate its war powers more broadly); Panama Refin., \n293 U.S. at 422 (same).  So the fact that the Court has \nupheld certain broad delegations does not necessarily \ndictate that we uphold \u00a7 254\u2019s delegation of power to \nFCC to levy taxes on American consumers.  And \u00a7 254 \nappears unlike any delegation the Court has ever \nblessed. \n \ntheir consolidated lawmaking and law-execution powers\u201d), that jus-\ntification is absent here. \n\n34a \n \nFor starters, the Supreme Court\u2019s nondelegation \u201cju-\nrisprudence has been driven by a practical understand-\ning that in our increasingly complex society, replete with \never changing and more technical problems, Congress \nsimply cannot do its job absent an ability to delegate \npower under broad general directives.\u201d  Mistretta, 488 \nU.S. at 372 (emphasis added).  So the Court has deemed \nit constitutionally sufficient for Congress to make a pol-\nicy judgment and then direct an agency to give that \njudgment effect through the application of technical \nknowledge. \nFor example, in American Trucking, 531 U.S. 457, \nthe Court considered a congressional directive to EPA \nto set ambient air quality standards for certain pollu-\ntants.

It held that the statute supplied an \nintelligible principle because it required EPA to set air \nquality standards \u201crequisite to protect the public \nhealth\u201d \u201cfor a discrete set of pollutants\u201d based on \u201cthe \nlatest scientific knowledge.\u201d  Id. at 472-73.  In other \nwords, the statute was constitutional because Congress \nmade the crucial policy judgment\u2014that the public \nshould be protected from harmful pollutants\u2014 and then \nrelied on EPA to give effect to that judgment through \nthe application of its scientific expertise.11  See Gundy, \n588 U.S. at 166 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting) (explaining that \nthe \u201cmost important[]\u201d question in the intelligible prin-\nciple inquiry is whether \u201cCongress, and not the Execu-\ntive Branch, ma[d]e the policy judgments\u201d). \n \n11 The Court upheld the delegation only after deciding that the \nstatute in question \u201cunambiguously bar[red] cost considerations \nfrom the NAAQS-setting process.\u201d  Id. at 471; see also id. at 473-\n74 (noting the statute \u201cdid not permit economic costs to be consid-\nered\u201d). \n\n35a \n \nHere, in contrast, Congress did not delegate because \nFCC has some superior technical knowledge about the \noptimal amount of universal service funding.  No such \nknowledge exists because determining the ideal size of \na welfare program involves policy judgments, not tech-\nnical ones.  And under our Constitution, those judg-\nments usually are Congress\u2019s to make. \nIn fact, in every case where the Court has upheld a \ncongressional delegation of its prerogative to make sig-\nnificant policy judgments, there has been some special \njustification.  In Mistretta, for example, the Court con-\nsidered a congressional delegation of authority to Arti-\ncle III judges to promulgate sentencing guidelines.  \nFew things are more policy-laden than criminal sentenc-\ning decisions, but the Court found the delegation per-\nmissible because \u201cthe Judiciary always has played, and \ncontinues to play, [a role] in sentencing.\u201d  Mistretta, \n488 U.S. at 391; see also ibid. (\u201cJust as the rules of pro-\ncedure bind judges and courts in the proper manage-\nment of the cases before them, so the Guidelines bind \njudges and courts in the exercise of their uncontested \nresponsibility to pass sentence in criminal cases.  In \nother words, the Commission\u2019s functions, like this \nCourt\u2019s function in promulgating procedural rules, are \nclearly attendant to a central element of the historically \nacknowledged mission of the Judicial Branch.\u201d). \nSimilarly, in National Broadcasting Co. v. United \nStates, 319 U.S. 190 (1943), the Court upheld a delega-\ntion to FCC to regulate broadcasting \u201cas public conven-\nience, interest, or necessity requires.  . . .  \u201d  Id. at  \n214.

See, e.g., Yakus, 321 U.S. at 420 (upholding a del-\negation to the agency to fix the prices of commodities at \na level that \u201cwill be generally fair and equitable and will \neffectuate the purposes of the Act.\u201d  (citation omit-\nted)); Am.

It can hardly be con-\ntended that the executive wanted for legislative direc-\ntion under this statute, or that reviewing courts lacked \nworkable standards.  See id. at 426 (noting that \u201cthe \nstandards prescribed by the  . . .  Act\u201d were \u201csuffi-\nciently definite and precise to enable Congress, the \ncourts and the public to ascertain whether the Adminis-\ntrator, in fixing the designated prices, has conformed to \nthose standards\u201d).  Similarly in American Power & \nLight Co., the Court found that \u201ca veritable code of \nrules\u201d set out in other sections of the statute clarified \nthe ambiguities inherent in the phrases \u201cunduly or un-\nnecessarily complicate[d]\u201d and \u201cunfairly or inequitably \ndistribute[d]\u201d such that courts would have no trouble \ntesting SEC\u2019s policies against the law.  329 U.S. at 104- \n05. \nThe Court\u2019s other nondelegation precedents are in \naccord.  The statute considered in J.W.

Id. at 401; see also Gundy, 588 U.S. at \n163 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting) (noting that the statute \nmay have required the President to make \u201cintricate cal-\nculations, but it could be argued that Congress had \nmade all the relevant policy decisions, and the Court\u2019s \nreference to an \u2018intelligible principle\u2019 was just another \nway to describe the traditional rule that Congress may \nleave the executive the responsibility to find facts and \n\n39a \n \nfill up details.\u201d).  And the term \u201cpublic interest\u201d in  \n\u00a7 407 of the Transportation Act of 1920 was shorthand \nfor a congressional instruction to the Interstate Com-\nmerce Commission to ensure that proposed railroad \nconsolidation would not result in deteriorating service \nquality or unreasonable or discriminatory rates\u2014an in-\nstruction with discernible content in light of the common \nlaw of common carriers.

And the statute considered in \nTouby \u201cmeaningfully constrain[ed] the Attorney Gen-\neral\u2019s discretion\u201d because it directed the Attorney Gen-\neral to ban drugs only after making a factual determina-\ntion that there was a history of significant abuse that \nthreatened the public health.  See 500 U.S. at 166; see \nalso Gundy, 588 U.S. at 166 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting) \n(noting that in Touby the Court \u201cstressed all [the statu-\ntory] constraints on the Attorney General\u2019s discretion  \n. . .  to indicate that the statute supplied an \u2018intelligi-\nble principle\u2019 because it assigned an essentially fact-\nfinding responsibility to the executive.\u201d  (emphasis in \noriginal)).  And the statute considered in Lichter, 334 \nU.S. 742\u2014which authorized the executive to recoup \u201cex-\ncessive profits\u201d on wartime government contracts\u2014was \n\n40a \n \nlikewise judicially workable.  As the Court noted, \u2018ex-\ncessive\u2019 simply means \u201c[g]reater than the usual amount \nor degree.\u201d  Id. at 785 n.37 (quoting WEBSTER\u2019S NEW \nINTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY (2d ed. 1938)).  A re-\nviewing court would thus have no trouble discerning \nwhether a contractor reaped in excess because it could \neasily compare his profits to those of his peers.12  And \nso on and so forth. \n* * * \nSo amidst all the statutes that have survived nondele-\ngation challenges, \u00a7 254 stands alone.  Unlike delega-\ntions implicating special agency expertise, \u00a7 254 dele-\ngates to FCC the power to make important policy judg-\nments, and to make them while wholly immunized from \nthe oversight Congress exercises through the regular \nappropriations process.  Unlike delegations implicat-\ning the power to impose criminal sentences, taxation has \nalways been an exclusively legislative function.  Unlike \n \n12 Moreover, as we have noted, context matters to the intelligible-\nprinciple inquiry.  So assuming arguendo Lichter blessed a dele-\ngation more sweeping than any other (we think it did not), it is \nsurely relevant that the Court emphasized that the statute in ques-\ntion came about because of the necessities of war, \u201csprang from \n[Congress\u2019s] war powers,\u201d and operated only for \u201cthe duration of \nthe war or  . . .  a short time thereafter.\u201d  Id. at 755; 787.  As \nthe Court explained, because \u201c[t]he power to wage war is the power \nto wage war successfully,\u201d \u201c[r]easonable regulations to safeguard \nthe resources upon which we depend for military success must be \nregarded as being within the powers confided to Congress to ena-\nble it to prosecute a successful war.\u201d  Id. at 780-81.  The Panama \nRefining Court similarly deemed the wartime posture of certain \nbroad delegations meaningful to the delegation inquiry because the \nPresident himself has war powers \u201ccognate to the conduct by him \nof the foreign relations of the government.\u201d  293 U.S. at 422. \n\n41a \n \nthe power to impose conditions on the use of public prop-\nerty, taxation involves the conversion of private prop-\nerty.  And unlike other congressional delegations im-\nplicating core legislative functions, \u00a7 254 is a hollow shell \nthat Congress created for FCC to fill\u2014so amorphous \nthat no reviewing court could ever possibly invalidate \nany FCC action taken in its name.13 \n \n13 Section 254 also implicates the taxing power, which makes the \nnondelegation concerns it raises especially salient.  See Nat\u2019l Ca-\nble, 415 U.S. at 341 (\u201cIt would be such a sharp break with our tra-\nditions to conclude that Congress had bestowed on a federal agency \nthe taxing power that we read [the relevant statute] narrowly as \nauthorizing not a \u2018tax\u2019 but a \u2018fee.\u2019\u201d).  That is because limitations on \nthe taxing power have long been the mechanism through which the \npeople curb the excesses of unelected power.  See The Federalist \nNo. 58 (J. Madison) (\u201c[The House], in a word, hold[s] the purse that \npowerful instrument by which we behold, in the history of the Brit-\nish Constitution, an infant and humble representation of the people \ngradually enlarging the sphere of its activity and importance, and \nfinally reducing, as far as it seems to have wished, all the over-\ngrown prerogatives of the other branches of the government.\u201d). \n For that reason, the framers through the Origination Clause \ntook special care to ensure that the taxing power remained inti-\nmately connected with the people.  See U.S. CONST. art. I, \u00a7 7, cl.1 \n(\u201cAll Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Rep-\nresentatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with Amend-\nments as on other Bills.\u201d); 1 THE RECORDS OF THE FEDERAL CON-\nVENTION of 1787 544 (Max Farrand ed., 2d ed. 1937) (George Mason) \n(\u201c[T]he consideration which weighed with the Committee [when \ndrafting the Origination Clause] was that the [House] would be the \nimmediate representatives of the people, the [Senate] would not.\u201d).  \nIn fact, \u201cvesting the origination power with the House was an inte-\ngral part of the deal that resolved the conflict over congressional ap-\nportionment: seats in the Senate would not be apportioned based on \npopulation, but only the House of Representatives would have the \npower to initiate legislation that raises or spends money.\u201d  Kroto-\nszynksi, Jr., Reconsidering the Nondelegation Doctrine, supra, at \n \n\n42a \n \nWe therefore have grave concerns about \u00a7 254\u2019s con-\nstitutionality under the Supreme Court\u2019s nondelegation \nprecedents.  See Gundy, 588 U.S. at 136 (plurality op.) \n(noting that the Court \u201cwould face a nondelegation ques-\ntion\u201d if the statutory provision at issue had \u201cgrant[ed] \nthe Attorney General plenary power to determine [the \nstatute\u2019s] applicability to pre-Act offenders\u2014to require \nthem to register, or not, as she sees fit, and to change \nher policy for any reason and at any time\u201d (emphasis \nadded) (citation omitted)).  Nevertheless, we need not \nhold the agency action before us unconstitutional on that \nground alone because the unprecedented nature of the \ndelegation combined with other factors is enough to hold \nit unlawful.  See infra, Part III.D. \nC. \nThe Q1 2022 USF Tax is not only difficult to square \nwith the Supreme Court\u2019s public nondelegation prece-\ndents.  It was also formulated by private entities.  \nThat raises independent but equally serious questions \nabout its compatibility with Article I, \u00a7 1, which requires \n\u201c[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested \nin a Congress.\u201d  We (1) explain that the scope of FCC\u2019s \ndelegation to private entities may violate the Legislative \nVesting Clause by allowing private entities to exercise \n \n252.  Benjamin Franklin, among others, noted that \u201cthe two clauses, \nthe originating of money bills, and the equality of votes in the Senate, \n[are] essentially connected by the compromise which had been \nagreed to.\u201d  2 THE RECORDS OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION, su-\npra, at 233. \n So the Constitution\u2019s original meaning would seem to compel a \nmore restrictive test for delegations of the taxing power.  Never-\ntheless, the Supreme Court has declined to apply heightened scru-\ntiny to tax-related delegations, see Skinner, 490 U.S. at 223, and we \nare not authorized to depart from that holding. \n\n43a \n \ngovernment power.  Then we (2) explain that even if \nFCC\u2019s delegation could be constitutionally justified, \nFCC may have violated the Legislative Vesting Clause \nby delegating government power to private entities \nwithout express congressional authorization. \n1. \na. \nThe Supreme Court has held Congress has broad dis-\ncretion to empower executive agencies to \u201cexecute\u201d the \nlaw.  See City of Arlington v. FCC, 569 U.S. 290, 304 \nn.4 (2013).  \u201cWhen it comes to private entities, how-\never, there is not even a fig leaf of constitutional justifi-\ncation.  Private entities are not vested with legislative \nPowers.  Nor are they vested with the executive \nPower, which belongs to the President.\u201d  Amtrak II, \n575 U.S. at 62 (Alito, J., concurring) (quotation and cita-\ntions omitted).  So it is clear that delegations to private \nentities raise constitutional concerns entirely distinct \nfrom delegations to the executive. \nOnly four times has the Supreme Court considered \nwhether a delegation to private entities violates Article \nI\u2019s Vesting Clause.14 \nFirst, in Schechter Poultry, the Court considered a \nconstitutional challenge to the National Industrial Re-\n \n14 The parties in Amtrak II raised a private delegation challenge, \nbut the Court did not reach it because it determined that, for rele-\nvant purposes, Amtrak was a governmental entity.  See 575 U.S. \nat 55.  The Court has also several times considered whether state \ndelegations of legislative power to private entities violated due pro-\ncess, see Paul J. Larkin, The Private Delegation Doctrine, 73 Fla. \nL. Rev. 31, 45-47 (2021), but those cases present a question differ-\nent from the one before us. \n\n44a \n \ncovery Act (\u201cNIRA\u201d) of 1933, 48 Stat. 195.  See 295 \nU.S. at 519-21.  That statute delegated to trade or in-\ndustrial groups the authority to develop codes defining \n\u201cunfair method[s] of competition.\u201d  Id. at 521 n.4 (quo-\ntation omitted).  If the codes were approved by the \nPresident, they were to become law under \u201csuch excep-\ntions to and exemptions from the provisions of such \ncode, as the President in his discretion deem[ed] neces-\nsary to effectuate the policy\u201d of the NIRA.  Ibid.  The \nCourt held that the statute was unconstitutional.  In \npart, it reasoned the idea that \u201cCongress could delegate \nits legislative authority to trade or industrial associa-\ntions or groups so as to empower them to enact the laws \nthey deem to be wise and beneficent for the rehabilita-\ntion and expansion of their trade or industries,\u201d or that \n\u201ctrade or industrial associations or groups be consti-\ntuted legislative bodies for that purpose because such \nassociations or groups are familiar with the problems of \ntheir enterprises\u201d was \u201cutterly inconsistent with the \nconstitutional prerogatives and duties of Congress.\u201d  \nId. at 537. \nThe next year, in Carter v. Carter Coal Company, 298 \nU.S. 238, 278 (1936), the Court considered a delegation \nchallenge to the Bituminous Coal Conservation Act of \n1935, 49 Stat. 991 (repealed 1937).  That statute au-\nthorized the district board in local coal districts (the \n\u201ccode authority\u201d) to adopt a code that included agreed-\nupon minimum prices for coal. Carter Coal, 298 U.S. at \n282-83.  It also allowed an agreement between produc-\ners of more than two-thirds of the annual tonnage of coal \nand a majority of mine workers to set industry-wide \nminimum wage and maximum working-hour agree-\nments.  Id. at 283-84.  Both the minimum price codes \nand the labor codes bound producers\u2014i.e., obtained le-\n\n45a \n \ngal force\u2014without approval by any federal official.  Id. \nat 282, 284.  The Court explained the statute amounted \nto \u201cdelegation in its most obnoxious form\u201d because it \npurported to delegate regulatory power not \u201cto an offi-\ncial or an official body, presumptively disinterested,\u201d \nbut rather \u201cto private persons whose interests  . . .  \noften are adverse\u201d to those whom the statute authorized \nthem to regulate.  Id. at 311.  That, the Court held, \nwas \u201can intolerable and unconstitutional interference \nwith personal liberty and private property.\u201d  Ibid.15 \nIn Currin v. Wallace, 306 U.S. 1, 5-6 (1939), the Court \nconsidered a delegation challenge to the Tobacco In-\nspection Act of 1935, 49 Stat. 731 which authorized the \nSecretary of Agriculture to designate markets in which \nno tobacco could be sold unless it had \u201cbeen inspected \nand certified by an authorized representative of the Sec-\nretary according to the established standards.\u201d One of \nthe bases for the challenge was that the Secretary could \nnot designate a market unless two-thirds of the growers \nvoting at a prescribed referendum favored the designa-\ntion.  See Currin, 306 U.S. at 6, 15.  But the producers \nhad no power to designate the markets in which classifi-\ncation would be required; only the Secretary could do \nthat.  Nor did the statute even provide that the produc-\ners would help craft regulations.  So unlike the private \nbodies in Carter Coal, the tobacco producers had no \n \n15 The Court did not clearly specify which constitutional provision \n\u2014the Legislative Vesting Clause or the Fifth Amendment Due \nProcess Clause\u2014the statute offended.  See id. at 310-12; see also \nNat\u2019l Horsemen\u2019s Benevolent & Protective Ass\u2019n v. Black, 53 F.4th \n869, 881 n.23 (5th Cir. 2022).  But because the relevant portion of \nthe Carter Coal cited Schechter Poultry, a Vesting Clause case, \nalongside Due Process cases, the Court presumably held the dele-\ngation was unlawful on both grounds. \n\n46a \n \npower to \u201cmake the law and force it upon a minority.\u201d  \nId. at 15-16 (citation omitted).  Congress merely gave \nthem the ability to prevent certain regulations from tak-\ning effect.  See ibid.  The Court accordingly rejected \nthe challenge on the ground that the statute did not del-\negate any legislative power to private entities.  Ibid. \nFinally, in Sunshine Anthracite Coal Company v. \nAdkins, 310 U.S. 381, 387 (1940), the Court considered a \nprivate delegation challenge to The Bituminous Coal Act \nof 1937, 50 Stat. 72 (repealed 1966), a revised version of \nthe statute the Court held unlawful in Carter Coal.  \nCongress\u2019s most important revision was to relegate the \ncode authorities from lawmakers to \u201caid[s]\u201d subject to \nthe \u201cpervasive surveillance and authority\u201d of the Na-\ntional Bituminous Coal Commission.  Sunshine An-\nthracite, 310 U.S. at 388.  Under the revised statute, \ncode authorities could \u201cpropose\u201d minimum prices, but \ntheir proposals were legal nullities until they were ex-\npressly \u201capproved, disapproved, or modified\u201d by the \nCoal Commission.  Ibid.  Thus, the Court concluded \nthat the Commission, \u201cnot the code authorities, deter-\nmine[d] [coal] prices,\u201d id. at 399, and it therefore held \nthat the statute did not unconstitutionally delegate gov-\nernment power to private entities. \nLower courts have discerned from these cases the \n\u201ccardinal constitutional principle [] that federal power \ncan be wielded only by the federal government.\u201d  \nBlack, 53 F.4th at 872.  Private delegations are thus \nconstitutional only on three conditions.  First, govern-\nment officials must have final decision-making author-\nity.  See Larkin, The Private Delegation Doctrine,  \nsupra, at 50-51 (noting that in every case in which the \nSupreme Court has upheld a private delegation, \u201cthe \n\n47a \n \nlaw[] at issue  . . .  left final decision-making author-\nity in the hands of a government official\u201d).  Second, \nagencies must actually exercise their authority rather \nthan \u201creflexively rubber stamp [work product] prepared \nby others.\u201d  Sierra Club v. Lynn, 502 F.2d 43, 59 (5th \nCir. 1974); see State v. Rettig, 987 F.3d 518, 531 (5th Cir. \n2021), cert. denied, Tex. v. Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, \n142 S. Ct. 1308 (2022) (\u201cA federal agency may not abdi-\ncate its statutory duties by delegating them to a private \nentity.\u201d  (quotation and citation omitted)).16  And third, \nthe private actors must always remain subject to the \n\u201cpervasive surveillance and authority\u201d of some person \nor entity lawfully vested with government power.  Sun-\nshine Anthracite, 310 U.S. at 388. \nIn light of these strictures on private delegations, we \nheld unconstitutional a statute that vested a private en-\ntity with the power to make rules regulating an industry \nwhere those rules were subject only to limited agency \nreview.  See Black, 53 F.4th at 884-89.  And the D.C. \nCircuit similarly held unconstitutional a statute that em-\npowered Amtrak to work jointly with the Federal Rail-\nroad Administration to develop binding railroad perfor-\nmance standards because the statute did not vest FRA \nwith complete regulatory control.  See Amtrak I, 721 \nF.3d at 670-74, vacated and remanded sub nom. Amtrak \n \n16  Lynn arose under the National Environmental Policy Act \n(\u201cNEPA\u201d), not the Constitution.  But Rettig repeatedly cited Lynn \nto expound the level of control agencies must retain over private \nactors wielding governmental power for constitutional purposes. \nRettig, 987 F.3d at 532.  The central question in Lynn was wheth-\ner an agency bore ultimate responsibility for work product pre-\npared by a private entity, see 502 F.2d at 59, which is required not \nonly by NEPA but also by the Legislative Vesting Clause, see, e.g., \nBlack, 53 F.4th at 881. \n\n48a \n \nII, 575 U.S. 43; see also Black, 53 F.4th at 889-90 (rely-\ning on Amtrak I\u200a). \nIn contrast, where courts have deemed delegations to \nprivate entities constitutional, they have uniformly em-\nphasized the agency\u2019s actual decision-making authority \nand control.  For example, when the Third Circuit ap-\nproved the National Association of Securities Dealers\u2019 \nrole in securities regulation, it explained industry self-\nregulation raises \u201cserious constitutional challenges.\u201d  \nTodd & Co. v. SEC, 557 F.2d 1008, 1014 (3d Cir. 1977). \nAccordingly, the Court held securities self-regulation \nwas constitutional only after emphasizing that SEC was \nobliged to \u201cinsure fair treatment of those disciplined by\u201d \nNASD.  Ibid.  It also stressed that SEC was statuto-\nrily required to review NASD orders, make de novo \nfindings, and come to an \u201cindependent decision on\u201d se-\ncurities\u2019 violations and penalties.  See id. at 1012; see \nalso id. at 1012-13 (\u201c[NASD\u2019s] rules and its disciplinary \nactions were subject to full review by the S.E.C., a \nwholly public body, which must base its decision on its \nown findings.\u201d  (emphasis added)).  Similarly, when \nwe approved a private entity\u2019s role in drafting an envi-\nronmental impact statement, we emphasized that \u201cthe \napplicable federal agency [bore] the responsibility for \nthe ultimate work product\u201d and \u201cindependently per-\nform[ed] its reviewing, analytical and judgmental func-\ntions.\u201d  Lynn, 502 F.2d at 59 (quotation and citation \nomitted); see also Rettig, 987 F.3d at 531-32 (citing Lynn \nin an Art. I, \u00a7 1 challenge). \nb. \nFCC has delegated government power\u2014the power to \ndictate the size of the universal service contribution \namount, which controls the size of a tax levied on Amer-\n\n49a \n \nican consumers\u2014to USAC and private telecommunica-\ntions carriers.  That delegation is lawful only if FCC (1) \nhas final decision-making authority, (2) actually exer-\ncises that authority, and (3) exercises \u201cpervasive sur-\nveillance and authority\u201d over the private entities exer-\ncising power in its name.  Black, 53 F.4th at 884 (quot-\ning Sunshine Anthracite, 310 U.S. at 388). \nFCC\u2019s subdelegation of its taxing power violates this \ntest in two ways.  The first problem is that FCC regu-\nlations provide that USAC\u2019s projections take legal effect \nwithout formal FCC approval. \n See 47 C.F.R.  \n\u00a7 54.709(a)(3).  FCC has, in effect, given private enti-\nties the final say with respect to the size of the USF Tax.  \nThat FCC retains discretion to revise the proposed con-\ntribution amount, see ibid., is insufficient.  Congress \ncould not say:  \u201cThe defense budget is whatever Lock-\nheed Martin wants it to be, unless Congress intervenes \nto revise it.\u201d  To make law, Congress must affirma-\ntively adopt the statutory text, pass it bicamerally, and \npresent it to the President for signature.  INS v. \nChadha, 462 U.S. 919, 959 (1983).  Legislation requires \naction not acquiescence.  Similarly, while FCC may so-\nlicit advice from USAC and private carriers, it must af-\nfirmatively act to give legal effect to that advice because \nit alone has constitutional authority to execute 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254. \nThe second problem is that FCC does not appear to \n\u201cindependently perform[] its reviewing, analytical and \njudgmental functions\u201d with respect to the privately sup-\nplied universal service contribution amount.  Rettig, \n987 F.3d at 532 (quoting Lynn, 502 F.2d at 59).  FCC \nhas not pointed us to anything that suggests it even \nchecks USAC\u2019s work.  Instead, it appears to \u201creflex-\n\n50a \n \nive[ly] rubber stamp\u201d whatever contribution amount \nUSAC proposes.  Lynn, 502 F.2d at 59.  The record \nbefore us shows that, before this litigation started, FCC \nnever made a single substantive change to the contribu-\ntion amounts proposed by USAC.  See supra, at 6 & \nn.1.17 \nThat is a de facto abdication.  And when an agency \nde facto abdicates to a private entity its responsibility to \nmake governmental decisions, that entity becomes more \nthan a mere \u201caid\u201d to the agency.  See Black, 53 F.4th at \n881 (quoting Sunshine Anthracite, 310 U.S. at 388).  \nThe private company becomes a lawmaker in its own \nright.  So de jure approval alone is not enough.  If \nFCC is going to rely on a non-governmental actor to \nsupply a revenue requirement that dictates the size of a \ntax levied on American consumers, it must at the very \nleast do something to demonstrate that it applied its in-\ndependent judgment. \nc. \nThe Government\u2019s principal counterargument is that \nFCC\u2014not USAC\u2014is exercising governmental power.  \nIts argument goes like this:  FCC sets out detailed reg-\nulations specifying who is eligible for what kinds of uni-\nversal service subsidies.  Private companies merely \nproject the costs they will incur supplying the FCC-\nspecified subsidized services and report that infor-\nmation to USAC.  And then USAC merely aggregates \n \n17 Even if FCC wanted to change USAC\u2019s proposals, it is not at \nall clear it could.  Petitioners contend, and FCC does not dispute, \nthat the \u201capproval\u201d process for USAC\u2019s proposals plays out just \ndays before the new quarter begins.  With such a short time win-\ndow, it appears FCC has no real choice but to accept USAC\u2019s pro-\nposed figures. \n\n51a \n \nthat information into a contribution amount, which FCC \nturns into the contribution factor that is levied on tele-\ncommunications revenues as a USF Tax.  FCC regula-\ntions even preclude USAC from making policy.  So in \ndetermining the contribution amount, which directly \ncontrols the size of the tax levied on American telecom-\nmunications consumers, USAC and private carriers per-\nform a simple, ministerial task\u2014a mere \u201cfact gathering \nfunction for the FCC.\u201d  FCC EB Br. 56 (quotation \nomitted). \nBut FCC obfuscates how the universal service sau-\nsage is really made.  FCC would have us believe its uni-\nversal service policy necessarily dictates the size of the \ncontribution amount, and so FCC really controls the size \nof the USF Tax.  But that cannot be right because USF \ndisbursements often do not comply with FCC policy.  \nSee supra, Part I.C.  Instead, large swaths of USF \nfunds\u2014perhaps at one point close to one-quarter\u2014are \ndisbursed to ineligible recipients.  See, e.g., THE HIGH-\nCOST PROGRAM, supra, at 2.  That FCC sets universal \nservice policy obviously does nothing to limit the reve-\nnue FCC allows private entities to exact from consum-\ners to fund payments made in violation of FCC\u2019s uni-\nversal service policy. \nPut differently, FCC policy would dictate the contri-\nbution amount only if it in fact dictated how private com-\npanies raised and spent USF monies.  The problem is \nthat FCC has abdicated responsibility for ensuring com-\npliance to the very entities whose universal service de-\nmand projections dictate the size of the contribution \namount.  See, e.g., FCC\u2019s LIFELINE PROGRAM, supra, \nat executive summary page (noting that FCC \u201crelies on \nover 2,000 Eligible Telecommunication Carriers that are \n\n52a \n \nLifeline providers to implement key program functions, \nsuch as verifying subscriber eligibility,\u201d which is prob-\nlematic because \u201ccompanies may have financial incen-\ntives to enroll as many customers as possible\u201d); FCC\u2019s \nE-RATE PROGRAM, supra, at 21-22 (noting that telecom-\nmunications service providers have opportunities to \n\u201cmake misrepresentations  . . .  during the funding \nphase\u201d that \u201cmay not be discovered due to the self- \ncertifying nature of the program\u201d). \nMoreover, the entity most responsible for snuffing \nout wasteful or fraudulent disbursements\u2014USAC\u2014is \nrun almost entirely by stakeholders who stand to benefit \nfinancially when universal service subsidies grow.  See \nLeadership, UNIVERSAL SERV. ADMIN. CO., supra; see \nalso FCC\u2019s E-RATE PROGRAM, supra, at 15 (noting that \nFCC relies on USAC to ensure compliance carrier com-\npliance with FCC rules).  And that is no accident. \nUSAC is run by self-interested stakeholders because \nFCC regulations require it.  See 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.703(b).  \nFCC mandates that nine of USAC\u2019s nineteen directors \nrepresent companies in the telecommunications indus-\ntry who are compensated by the very same USF funds \nthey raise.  See id. \u00a7 54.703(b)(1)-(6).  It mandates that an-\nother seven represent the schools, libraries, health care \nproviders, and low-income consumers who are direct re-\ncipients of USF funds.  See id. \u00a7 54.703(b)(7)-(10). \nBecause the telecommunications industry polices its \nown compliance with FCC universal service policy, and \nresponsibility for monitoring the industry falls most \nheavily on a board composed of industry representatives \nand consumer groups with a direct financial interest in \nthe size of USF taxes, private entities have a far more \nimportant and discretionary role in determining the size \n\n53a \n \nof the contribution amount (which controls the level of \nuniversal service taxation) than FCC would have you be-\nlieve.  For example, a carrier could (intentionally or un-\nintentionally) project and then supply USF-subsidized \nservice costing twenty-five percent more than its USF-\nsubsidized service would cost if it strictly complied with \nFCC rules.  And FCC offers us zero reason to think it \nwould even discover the discrepancy\u2014let alone that \nFCC would do anything about it.  FCC has in effect \nsaid to carriers:  \u201cHere is our universal service policy \nand a blank check.  We\u2019re not going to pay any atten-\ntion to what you put in the dollar box.  We know you \nhave financial incentives to juice the number, but we \ntrust you\u2019ll follow our policy to the letter anyways.  \nJust fill it out however you see fit, take it to the bank, \nand the money will be drawn from the accounts of Amer-\nican telecommunications consumers.\u201d  We do not doubt \nthat most of the industry is staffed by individuals of the \nutmost integrity, but we cannot agree that private enti-\nties are no more than ministerial bean counters when it \ncomes to setting the USF Tax. \nMoreover, even if we put the compliance issue to one \nside, we would still disagree that private companies have \nmerely \u201cministerial\u201d control over the contribution amount. \nAs we have noted, FCC\u2019s counterargument turns on the \nCommission\u2019s nominal control over universal service \npolicy.  But setting a policy is not the same as allocat-\ning funds to execute that policy.  That much is evident \nfrom the constitutional requirement that Congress ap-\npropriate money to execute the government programs it \nestablishes.  See U.S. CONST. ART. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 7.  Thus, \nFCC\u2019s argument fails because it impermissibly col-\nlapses universal service funding decisions into universal \nservice policy decisions.  The decision of how much \n\n54a \n \nmoney should be set aside to execute FCC\u2019s universal \nservice policies\u2014the very decision FCC has delegated \nto USAC and private carriers\u2014is an independent deci-\nsion that requires independent judgment.  And surely \ndiscretion inheres in decisions about how much money \nto allocate to a massive federal welfare program.  See \nGaines v. Thompson, 74 U.S. (7 Wall.) 347, 353 (1868) \n(\u201cA ministerial duty  . . .  is one in respect to which \nnothing is left to discretion.\u201d  (quotation omitted)).  \nSo even if we thought FCC correctly described the role \nof private entities, we would still conclude that dictating \nthe contribution amount is an exercise of government \npower. \n* * * \nFCC has not delegated to private entities a trivial, \nfact-gathering role.  It has delegated the power to dic-\ntate the amount of money that will be exacted from tel-\necommunications carriers (and American consumers in \nturn) to promote \u201cuniversal service.\u201d  In other words, \nit has delegated the taxing power.  And the delegation \nis not even \u201cto an official or an official body, presump-\ntively disinterested,\u201d but rather to private persons \nvested with no government power and with interests \nthat \u201coften are adverse\u201d to those whom they are taxing.  \nCarter Coal, 298 U.S. at 311; see also Ass\u2019n of Am. Rail-\nroads v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Transp. (\u201cAmtrak III\u201d), 821 F.3d \n19, 29 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (\u201cDelegating legislative authority \nto official bodies is inoffensive because we presume \nthose bodies are disinterested, that their loyalties lie \nwith the public good, not their private gain.  But here, \nthe majority producers may be and often are adverse to \nthe interests of others in the same business.\u201d  (citation \nand quotation omitted)).  We accordingly have serious \n\n55a \n \ntrouble squaring FCC\u2019s subdelegation with Article I,  \n\u00a7 1 of the Constitution.18 \n2. \nEven if the Constitution does not categorically forbid \nFCC\u2019s delegation to USAC and private telecommunica-\ntions carriers, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254 does not authorize it.  \nAnd there is no precedent establishing that federal \nagencies may subdelegate powers in the absence of stat-\nutory authorization.  To the contrary, the only Su-\npreme Court cases blessing private delegations involved \nexplicit statutory authorizations. \na. \nAt the Founding, the maxim that delegata potestas \nnon potest delegari\u2014no delegated powers can be fur-\nther delegated\u2014was widely accepted.  The maxim has \nits roots in the civil law.  See Patrick W. Duff & Horace \nE. Whiteside, Delegata Potestas Non Potest Delegari:  \nA Maxim of American Constitutional Law, 14 COR-\nNELL L.Q. 168, 171 (1929).  Lord Coke enshrined the \nmaxim as a common law doctrine.  See id. at 170-71 (ci-\ntations omitted).  And the doctrine endured through \n \n18 JUDGE NEWSOM recently expressed skepticism that the private \nentities involved in USF may constitutionally exercise the power \nFCC delegated to them.  See Consumers\u2019 Rsch., 88 F.4th at 932 \n(Newsom, J., concurring).  But JUDGE NEWSOM voted to deny a \npetition for review that is almost identical to the one before us be-\ncause in his view, these private entities exercise executive rather \nthan legislative power, and petitioners did not raise an Article II \nchallenge.  Ibid.  With utmost respect to our distinguished col-\nleague, private entities do play a legislative role in the USF be-\ncause their projections directly control the size of USF tax rates, \nand setting tax rates is unquestionably a legislative function.  See \nsupra, Part III.B. \n\n56a \n \nthe founding generation, as evidenced by treatises of the \ngreat 19th-century scholars.  Samuel Livermore, for \nexample, noted that \u201c[a]n authority given to one person \ncannot in general be delegated by him to another; for \nbeing a personal trust and confidence it is not in its na-\nture transmissible, and if there be such a power to one \nperson, to exercise his judgment and discretion, he can-\nnot say, that the trust and confidence reposed in him \nshall be exercised at the discretion of another person.\u201d  \nA TREATISE ON THE LAW OF PRINCIPAL AND AGENT AND \nOF SALES BY AUCTION 54 (1818).  Likewise, James Kent \nwrote that \u201c[a]n agent, ordinarily and without express \nauthority, has not power to employ a sub-agent to do the \nbusiness, without the knowledge or consent of his prin-\nciple.  The maxim is, that delegatus non potest dele-\ngare, and the agency is generally a personal trust and \nconfidence which cannot be delegated.\u201d  2 COMMEN-\nTARIES ON AMERICAN LAW 496 (1827).  And Joseph \nStory agreed, explaining that \u201c[o]ne, who has a bare \npower or authority from another to do an act, must exe-\ncute it himself, and cannot delegate his authority to an-\nother; for this being a trust or confidence reposed in him \npersonally, it cannot be assigned to a stranger, whose \nability and integrity might not be known to the principal \nor who, if known, might not be selected by him for such \na purpose.\u201d  COMMENTARIES ON THE LAW OF AGENCY, \nAS A BRANCH OF COMMERCIAL AND MARITIME JURIS-\nPRUDENCE 66-67 (1844). \nAs with most rules, this one had exceptions.  Com-\nmon lawyers assumed that ministerial tasks could be \nsubdelegated.  See GARY LAWSON & GUY SEIDMAN, \u201cA \nGREAT POWER OF ATTORNEY\u201d:  UNDERSTANDING THE \nFIDUCIARY CONSTITUTION 115 (2017).  And a fiduciary \n\n57a \n \ndocument could specifically authorize subdelegations of \ndelegated authority.  Ibid. \nBut as a general matter, \u201c[t]he founding-era rule \nagainst subdelegation of delegated agency authority is \nas clearly established as any proposition of law can be \nestablished.\u201d  Id. at 114.  And it was not merely a \nproposition of agency law.  In fact, the Supreme Court \nonce noted that the maxim \u201chas had wider application in \nthe construction of our federal and state Constitutions \nthan it has in private law.\u201d  J.W. Hampton, 276 U.S. at \n405-06; see also Duff & Whiteside, Delegata Potestas \nNon Potest Delegari, supra, at 175 (\u201c[I]n cases which \ninvolve a supposed delegation to an independent board \nor commission, as well as those where the delegation is \nto the executive or judiciary, the maxim delegata \npotestas non potest delegari, or its English equivalent, \nhas been the chief reliance of the courts, and has at-\ntained in their eyes the dignity of a principle of consti-\ntutional law.\u201d). \nSo the Founders\u2019 law prohibited unauthorized sub-\ndelegations of non-ministerial delegated authority, and \nthe Supreme Court has recognized that as a constitu-\ntional principle.  See J.W. Hampton, 276 U.S. at 405-\n06; cf. Gundy, 588 U.S. at 135 (plurality op.) (\u201cArticle I \nof the Constitution provides that \u2018[a]ll legislative Powers \nherein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the \nUnited States.\u2019 \u00a7 1.  Accompanying that assignment of \npower to Congress is a bar on its further delegation.\u201d).  \nWe think the clear implication is that the Constitution \nimposes upon federal agencies\u2014acting as agents of the \npeople\u2019s representatives in Congress\u2014a duty to wield \ndelegated power unless Congress authorizes subdelega-\ntion or the subdelegation involves no more than ministe-\n\n58a \n \nrial tasks.  In other words, \u201cCongress may formalize [a \nlimited] role [for] private parties\u201d in executing its laws, \nAmtrak I, 721 F.3d at 671 (emphasis added) (citing Sun-\nshine Anthracite, 310 U.S. at 388), but agencies may not. \nb. \nThis rule does not just accord with law at the Found-\ning; it also accords with Supreme Court precedent. \nThe Court has emphasized the \u201cvital constitutional \nprinciple\u201d that \u201c[l]iberty requires accountability.\u201d  \nAmtrak II, 575 U.S. at 57 (Alito, J., concurring).  Every \nexecutive branch official is in some way accountable to \nthe people because every executive branch official may \nbe removed\u2014for good cause at least\u2014by the President, \nwho is himself \u201cthe most democratic and politically ac-\ncountable official in Government.\u201d  Seila L. LLC v. \nCFPB, 591 U.S. 197, 224 (2020).  Private persons, in \ncontrast, may not be removed by the President because \nprivate persons do not wield any portion of \u201cthe execu-\ntive Power\u201d our Constitution vests \u201cin a President of the \nUnited States of America.\u201d  U.S. CONST. art. II, \u00a7 1, cl. \n1.  There is no reason to lightly infer that Congress in-\ntends to insulate law execution from democratic ac-\ncountability in this way.19 \n \n19 Deciding who should exercise governmental power can be as \nimportant as deciding whether governmental power should be del-\negated in the first place.  If it were not, we would not care so \ndeeply about Presidential elections.  So democratic accountability \nis frustrated when decisions about who should exercise governmen-\ntal power are made by bureaucrats\u2014whose connection to the peo-\nple is real but highly attenuated\u2014rather than Congress, whose \nmembers are directly \u201caccountable to [their] constituents through \nregular popular elections.\u201d  Jarkesy, 34 F.4th at 459 (citation \nomitted). \n\n59a \n \nIn accordance with these principles, both Supreme \nCourt cases authorizing private entities to wield any-\nthing like government power involved express authori-\nzations from Congress.  The Tobacco Inspection Act \nconsidered in Currin expressly provided that regula-\ntions would take effect only with the support of two-\nthirds of the tobacco growers in the relevant market.  \nSee 306 U.S. at 6, 15.  And the Bituminous Coal Act \nconsidered in Sunshine Anthracite created the very pri-\nvate boards that proposed minimum prices and labor \ncodes to the Coal Commission.  See 310 U.S. at 387-88 \n(noting that the statute provided for \u201c[s]ome twenty dis-\ntrict boards of code members  . . .  which are to oper-\nate as an aid to the Commission\u201d and \u201cspecifie[d] in de-\ntail the methods of their organization and operation, the \nscope of their functions, and the jurisdiction of the Com-\nmission over them.\u201d).20 \nc. \nSection 254, by contrast, makes no mention of the fact \nthat private entities might be responsible for determin-\ning the size of the tax FCC levies on American consum-\ners.  It does not even mention USAC, a Delaware cor-\nporation FCC established without congressional author-\nization. \nWhen asked at oral argument to identify the portion \nof \u00a7 254 that authorizes FCC to subdelegate administra-\ntion of the universal service contribution mechanism to \nprivate entities, the Government\u2019s counsel could point \n \n20 Likewise the Maloney Act, which the Third Circuit considered \nin Todd & Co., specifically authorized registered organizations to \nself-regulate over-the-counter securities markets.  See 557 F.2d \nat 1012. \n\n60a \n \nonly to subsection \u00a7 254(b)(5).  See Oral Arg. at 46:40-\n48:55.  That subsection directs FCC to establish \n\u201cmechanisms to preserve and advance universal ser-\nvice.\u201d  \u00a7 254(b)(5).  But a directive to establish \u201cmech-\nanisms\u201d plainly does not imply that those \u201cmechanisms\u201d \nmay be controlled by a private, non-governmental entity \nincorporated by FCC without any involvement from \nCongress. \nIn fact, \u00a7 254(b)(5) seems to suggest precisely the op-\nposite.  Rather than directing FCC to establish private \nmechanisms, it specifically instructs FCC to establish \n\u201cFederal and State mechanisms,\u201d ibid., which indicates \nCongress intended to make government entities respon-\nsible for administering universal service programs.  So \nsubsection (b)(5) is unavailing. \nThe closest \u00a7 254 comes to contemplating that a non-\ngovernmental entity might play any role in executing \nthe statute is to incorporate by reference some of the \npreexisting regulations governing the Lifeline Program.  \nSee \u00a7 254(\u200aj) (\u201cNothing in this section shall affect the col-\nlection, distribution, or administration of the Lifeline \nAssistance Program provided for by the Commission \nunder regulations set forth in section 69.117 of title 47, \nCode of Federal Regulations, and other related sections \nof such title.\u201d).  Those regulations made the National \nExchange Carrier Association (\u201cNECA\u201d) responsible \nfor calculating the Lifeline Assistance charges levied  \non local exchange carriers.  See 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 69.117  \n(10-1-95 ed.).  And they gave local exchange carriers a \nsmall role in determining the size of Lifeline Assistance \ncharges because carriers could obtain subsidies for their \nself-reported costs incurred in waiving one kind of reg-\nulatory fee.  See id. \u00a7 69.104(\u200aj) (10-1-95 ed.). \n\n61a \n \nBut the fact that \u00a7 254 incorporated certain pre-1996 \nLifeline Assistance program regulations does not sug-\ngest Congress authorized FCC\u2019s abdication of responsi-\nbility for the USF Tax to private entities.  That is for \nthree reasons. \nFirst, NECA\u2019s role under 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 69.117 in 1995 \nwas not remotely analogous to USAC\u2019s current role of \nadministering the entire USF.  Section 69.117 charged \nNECA only with two simple, ministerial tasks:  (1) Cal-\nculating Lifeline Assistance charges by \u201cdividing the \nsum of one-twelfth of the projected annual Lifeline As-\nsistance revenue requirement and one-twelfth of the \nprojected annual revenue requirement calculated by all \ntelephone companies pursuant to \u00a7 69.104(l) by the num-\nber of common lines presubscribed to interexchange \ncarriers.  . . .  \u201d  Id. \u00a7 69.117(b) (10-1-95 ed.).  And \n(2) \u201cbill[ing] and collect[ing] the charge, and disburs-\n[ing] associated revenue.\u201d  Ibid.  USAC\u2019s role as USF \nadministrator, by contrast, involves far more than min-\nisterial tasks.  See supra, Part III.C.1.c. \nSecond, the carriers\u2019 role under 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 69.117 \n(and associated regulations) in 1995 was not analogous \nto their role in 2023.  Before the 1996 Act, FCC regu-\nlations authorized certain carriers to bill the Lifeline \nProgram for costs associated with waiving certain mi-\nnor, regulatorily imposed end user common line charges \nfor certain means-tested subscribers pursuant to a  \ncarrier-developed plan certified by FCC. \n \nId.  \n\u00a7 69.104(\u200aj) (10-1-95 ed.).  But carriers could waive end \nuser charges only if they reduced their own service rate \ncharges by an equivalent amount.  Ibid.  That is noth-\ning like the modern universal service regime, which al-\nlows a greatly expanded class of carriers to bill USF for \n\n62a \n \na broad range of subsidized services provided at no cost \nto themselves. \nThird, even if the role NECA and telecommunica-\ntions carriers played in administering Lifeline Assis-\ntance charges before \u00a7 254 was analogous to the role \nthey play in administering the modern Lifeline Pro-\ngram, there is no evidence Congress contemplated pri-\nvate entities would play the same role in administering \nthe three other major universal service programs FCC \nhas established pursuant to its \u00a7 254 authority.  That \nCongress provided a narrow role for certain private en-\ntities in administering a small government program sub-\nsidizing one kind of telecommunications service says \nnothing about whether Congress authorized a broadly \nexpanded class of private entities to play a central role \nin administering a nine-billion-dollar welfare fund offer-\ning subsidies for technologies no one could have imag-\nined when \u00a7 254 was enacted.  If anything, the text of  \n\u00a7 254 suggests Congress actually meant to preclude pri-\nvate entities from administering USF programs other \nthan Lifeline.  That is because NECA did administer \nthe pre-1996 USF.  See 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 69.116 (10-1-95 ed.).  \nBut NECA\u2019s USF responsibilities were distinct from its \nLifeline Assistance responsibilities; the former were \nspelled out in \u00a7 69.116, and the latter in \u00a7 69.117.  Con-\ngress referenced \u00a7 69.117 in \u00a7 254, but it conspicuously \ndid not reference \u00a7 69.116.  Congress\u2019s explicit recog-\nnition of one relatively minor aspect of private compa-\nnies\u2019 participation in the pre-1996 Lifeline Assistance \nregime thus evinces that Congress knew how to empower \nprivate companies and chose not to empower them to ad-\nminister other aspects of the USF. \n\n63a \n \nSo if Congress authorized FCC to delegate sweeping \nuniversal service responsibilities to private entities, it \ndid not say so very clearly.  Indeed, it speaks volumes \nthat the only plausible statutory justification for FCC\u2019s \nsubdelegation\u2014\u00a7 254(\u200aj)\u2014is so ambiguous that FCC, \nwhich should be more familiar with \u00a7 254 than anyone, \ndid not even think to point to it as justification for its \nreliance on private companies to set the USF Tax. \n* * * \nFCC subdelegated the power to determine the uni-\nversal service contribution amount to USAC, who fur-\nther subdelegated it to private, for- profit telecommuni-\ncations carriers.  That subdelegation was not author-\nized.  See supra, Part III.C.2.c.  And the tasks FCC \nsubdelegated are not ministerial.  See supra, Part \nIII.C.1.b-c.  So even if Article I, \u00a7 1 does not categori-\ncally forbid USAC and private telecommunications car-\nriers from exercising the kind of power FCC has vested \nin them, it may forbid them from doing so absent ex-\npress congressional authorization.21 \n \n21 Petitioners certainly could have framed their private nondele-\ngation challenge in statutory terms.  See Consumers\u2019 Rsch, 88 F.4th \nat 933 (Newsom, J., concurring) (\u201c[I]t may be that USAC is oper-\nating in contravention of the governing statute, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254, \nwhich conspicuously never even mentions USAC, let alone author-\nizes its involvement in the universal-service program.\u201d  (emphasis \nin original)).  But assuming private entities are permitted to ex-\nercise government power at all, the decision to delegate govern-\nment power to a private entity is itself a legislative one.  And since \nagencies may not wield legislative power, we are persuaded FCC\u2019s \nunauthorized decision to delegate government power to a private \nactor likely violates not only \u00a7 254 but also Article I, \u00a7 1 of the Con-\nstitution.  But see id. at 933 n.5 (Newsom, J., concurring) (ex-\n \n\n64a \n \nD. \nWe are highly skeptical that the contribution factor \nbefore us comports with the bar on congressional dele-\ngations of legislative power.  And we are similarly \nskeptical that it comports with the general rule that pri-\nvate entities may not wield governmental power, espe-\ncially not without express and unambiguous congres-\nsional authorization.  But we need not resolve either \nquestion in this case.  That is because the combination \nof Congress\u2019s sweeping delegation to FCC and FCC\u2019s \nunauthorized subdelegation to USAC violates the Leg-\nislative Vesting Clause in Article I, \u00a7 1. \nWe (1) explain the Supreme Court\u2019s cases instructing \nthat separation-of-powers jurisprudence is done holisti-\ncally, with an eye to constitutional history and structure, \nnot by dissecting government programs into their com-\nponent parts.  Then we (2) explain why an agency ac-\ntion involving a broad congressional delegation and an \nunauthorized agency subdelegation to private entities \nviolates the Constitution even if neither of those fea-\ntures does so independently. \n1. \nThe Supreme Court has instructed us to review  \nseparation-of-powers challenges holistically.  And it \nhas held that two or more things that are not inde-\npendently unconstitutional can combine to violate the \nConstitution\u2019s separation of powers. \n \npressing skepticism that the lack of statutory authorization for a \ndelegation to a private entity \u201chas any real bearing on the consti-\ntutional [private nondelegation] question\u201d (emphasis in original)). \n\n65a \n \nTake for example Seila Law, 591 U.S. 197.  The \nquestion presented in that case was whether a for-cause \nremoval restriction unconstitutionally infringed the \nPresident\u2019s power to remove the Director of the Con-\nsumer Financial Protection Bureau.  See id. at 204.  \nTwo lines of precedent seemed to converge to suggest \nthe removal restriction at issue posed no constitutional \nproblem.  First, Humphrey\u2019s Executor v. United States, \n295 U.S. 602 (1935), established that Congress may con-\nstitutionally grant for-cause removal protections to a \ngroup of agency directors that wield executive power.  \nSee also Seila L., 591 U.S. at 216 n.2 (noting that FTC \nhas always exercised executive power).  Second, Mor-\nrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654 (1988), established that Con-\ngress may constitutionally give for-cause removal pro-\ntection to a single official vested with executive author-\nity.  See also Seila L., 591 U.S. at 217 (noting that the \nindependent counsel wielded executive power).  The \nCourt of Appeals accordingly reasoned that Humph-\nrey\u2019s Executor and Morrison controlled and that the \nstatutory provision limiting the President\u2019s power to re-\nmove the CFPB director was constitutional.  CFPB v. \nSeila L. LLC, 923 F.3d 680, 684 (9th Cir. 2019). \nThe Supreme Court reversed.  It granted that some \nfor-cause removal restrictions are not problematic.  \nSee Seila L., 591 U.S. at 215.  And it granted that for-\ncause removal restrictions applied to single-member di-\nrectorships are sometimes constitutionally permissible.  \nSee id. at 217.  But it held the combination of (1) for-\ncause removal, (2) a one-member CFPB Director, and \n(3) the capacious powers of the CFPB created a consti-\ntutional problem.  Id. at 224-25; see also id. at 258 \n(Thomas, J., concurring in part) (\u201cThe constitutional vi-\nolation results from, at a minimum, the combination of \n\n66a \n \nthe removal provision and the provision allowing the \nCFPB to seek enforcement of a civil investigative de-\nmand.\u201d  (emphasis added) (citations omitted)).  In other \nwords, three features of the CFPB\u2014each independently \nconstitutional\u2014combined to create a \u201cnew situation\u201d \nthat could not be decided by reference to precedents \nthat concerned only one aspect of the problem.  Id. at \n220 (citation omitted). \nThe same kind of reasoning guided the Court in Free \nEnterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Over-\nsight Board, 561 U.S. 477 (2010).  In that case, the \nquestion presented was whether \u201cthe President [may \nbe] restricted in his ability to remove a principal officer, \nwho is in turn restricted in his ability to remove an infe-\nrior officer, even though that inferior officer determines \nthe policy and enforces the laws of the United States[.]\u201d  \nId. at 483-84.  The Court noted its previous holding \nthat Congress may provide for restrictions on the Pres-\nident\u2019s ability to remove the directors of independent \nagencies like SEC.  See id. at 483; see also Humphrey\u2019s \nExecutor, 295 U.S. 602.  It also noted its previous hold-\ning that Congress may provide for restrictions on the \npower of principal executive officers to remove their \nown inferiors.  See ibid.; see also United States v. Per-\nkins, 116 U.S. 483 (1886).  But the Court held that the \ncombination of two separate layers of removal protec-\ntions created \u201ca new situation not yet encountered by \nthe Court.\u201d  Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 483.  And \nthat combination, the Court held, violated the Constitu-\ntion.  Id. at 484. \nSeila Law and Free Enterprise Fund thus evince a \ngeneral principle that, with respect to the separation of \npowers at least, two constitutional parts do not neces-\n\n67a \n \nsarily add up to a constitutional whole.  Cf. Aristotle, \nMetaphysics, in 1 WORKS OF ARISTOTLE 569 (Mortimer \nJ. Adler ed., W. D. Ross trans., 1990) (observing \u201cthe \nwhole is\u201d often \u201csomething besides the parts\u201d).  Ra-\nther, reviewing courts must consider a government pro-\ngram holistically, with an eye toward its compatibility \nwith our constitutional history and structure.  See \nSeila L., 591 U.S. at 222. \n2. \nHere, history and structure both point in the same \ndirection:  the universal service contribution mecha-\nnism is unconstitutional. \na. \n\u201cPerhaps the most telling indication of a severe con-\nstitutional problem\u201d with the structure of a government \nprogram \u201cis a lack of historical precedent to support it.\u201d  \nId. at 220 (quotation omitted) (quoting Free Enter. \nFund, 561 U.S. at 505).  And USF\u2019s double-layered del-\negation is unprecedented. \nFirst, there is no record of any government program \nlike USF in all the U.S. Reports.  The only case that \neven remotely resembles USF\u2019s combination of a broad \ncongressional delegation with significant industry in-\nvolvement is Sunshine Anthracite, 310 U.S. 381.  See \nsupra, Part III.C.1.a. \nWhile Sunshine Anthracite is the closest analogue, it \nis not really that close. Unlike USAC and private tele-\ncommunications carriers, which de facto decide the USF \ncontribution amount, the code authorities under the Bi-\ntuminous Coal Act of 1937 only had the power to recom-\nmend minimum coal prices.  See 310 U.S. at 399 (\u201c[The \nCoal Commission], not the code authorities, determines \n\n68a \n \nthe prices.\u201d).  And the only recommendations the code \nauthorities could make were cabined by a clear rule:  \nCongress provided that minimum coal prices were to be \nfixed at a level which \u201creflect[ed] as nearly as possible \nthe relative market values at points of delivery taking \ninto account specifically enumerated factors,\u201d id. at 397 \n\u2014namely labor, supplies, power, taxes, insurance, work-\nmen\u2019s compensation, royalties, depreciation and deple-\ntion and all other direct expenses of production, coal op-\nerators\u2019 association dues, district board assessments for \nBoard operating expenses only levied under the code, \nand reasonable costs of selling and the cost of admin-\nistration.  See The Bituminous Coal Act of 1937, 50 \nStat. at 78.  Those enumerated factors, \u201cconsistently \nwith the process of coordination, yield a return to each \narea approximating its weighted average cost per ton.\u201d  \nSunshine Anthracite, 310 U.S. at 397.22 \nThat case is nothing like ours.  To make Sunshine \nAnthracite apposite, the Coal Commission\u2019s discretion \nto set minimum prices would have had to have been un-\nfettered (it was not); the Coal Commission\u2019s passive ac-\nquiescence would have had to make the code authorities\u2019 \nprice recommendations legally binding (it did not); and \nthere would have to have been evidence that the Coal \nCommission always agreed with the code authorities\u2019 \nprice recommendations (there was not). \nSecond, FCC has not pointed to any historical ana-\nlogue outside the U.S. Reports.  That is hardly surpris-\ning.  USF combines a sweeping delegation of the tax-\ning power, see supra, Part III.B, with a subdelegation of \n \n22 The statute also authorized the Commission to fix maximum \ncoal prices under certain circumstances, but the code authorities \nhad no role in formulating those maximums.  See ibid. \n\n69a \n \nthat power to private entities with a personal financial \ninterest in the size of the tax, see supra, Part III.C.  It \nis difficult to imagine early Congresses would have au-\nthorized a similarly dual-layered delegation of the tax-\ning power. \nTrue, Congress has always relied on the executive to \nexecute tax laws.  For example, in 1798 Congress \nvested tax assessors with authority to value real estate \nfor the purpose of administering a nationwide direct tax.  \nSee Act of July 14, 1798, ch. 75, 1 Stat. 597 (1798); see \nalso Nicholas R. Parrillo, A Critical Assessment of the \nOriginalist Case Against Administrative Regulatory \nPower: New Evidence from the Federal Tax on Private \nReal Estate in the 1790s, 130 YALE L.J. 1288 (2021).  \nBut the 1798 direct tax is no precedent for the USF Tax \nbecause the 1798 direct tax is nothing like the USF Tax.  \nThat is for three reasons. \nFirst, the 1798 Congress itself decided the amount of \nrevenue the Government would levy from American cit-\nizens.  See Parrillo, New Evidence, supra, at 1303 (\u201cCon-\ngress decided to raise $2 million nationwide and, per the \nConstitution\u2019s requirement for direct taxes, apportioned \nthat sum among the states according to each state\u2019s free \npopulation plus three-fifths of its slave population.\u201d).  \nIn contrast, Congress through \u00a7 254 delegated to FCC \nthe power to decide how much revenue the Government \nwill raise via USF taxes.  And FCC\u2019s revenue-raising \ndiscretion is limited only by the most amorphous of \nstandards.  See supra, Part III.B.2.  So while the 1798 \nExecutive Branch only had authority to raise $2 million, \nthe present-day FCC can levy taxes practically ad in-\nfinitum based on little more than its own conception of \n\n70a \n \nthe public interest.  See ibid.  It thus strains credulity to \nanalogize the 1798 direct tax to the USF Tax. \nSecond (and relatedly), unlike the Congress that en-\nacted \u00a7 254, the 1798 Congress made all the relevant tax \npolicy decisions.  It decided to raise $2 million, it de-\ncided to levy the $2 million through direct taxes on prop-\nerty (mostly real estate), and it decided how the tax bur-\nden would be allocated:  mainly in proportion to the \nvalue of citizens\u2019 property in money.  Parrillo, New Ev-\nidence, supra, at 1303; see supra, Part III.B.2 (explain-\ning the policy decisions \u00a7 254 leaves for FCC).  That \nmakes sense because tax decisions\u2014including decisions \nabout rates\u2014traditionally implicated the legislative power \nand so could not be made by officials in the executive \nbranch.  See PHILLIP HAMBURGER, IS ADMINISTRA-\nTIVE LAW UNLAWFUL 57-64 (2014). \nObviously a direct tax on land could not be adminis-\ntered without a fair accounting of the value of citizens\u2019 \nproperty, so Congress provided for assessors and gave \nthem authority to assess the value of citizens\u2019 property. \nCongress did not provide detailed instructions about \nhow assessors were to go about their business, but that \nis of no significance.  At common law, \u201c[d]etermina-\ntions of facts, including assessments, were understood  \n. . .  to be judicial in nature, not legislative.  Although \nnot actually exercises of judicial power, they were ex-\npected to mimic judicial decisions at least in being exer-\ncises of judgment\u201d as opposed to legislative will.  Ham-\nburger, Nondelegation Blues, supra, at 1211 (emphasis \nadded).  In other words, the making of assessments \nhas never involved legislative power because it has al-\nways been assumed that assessors must accurately \n\n71a \n \ncharacterize the facts on the ground and fairly apply the \nlaw to the facts. \nFor example, in 1598 the English Court of Common \nPleas heard a case concerning the power of the sewers \ncommissioners, who were tasked with repairing \nriverbanks and assessing the costs to nearby landown-\ners.  See Rooke\u2019s Case, 77 Eng. Rep. 209 (C.P. 1598) \n(Coke, J.).  The commissioners repaired a riverbank \nand then assessed the entire cost to one nearby land-\nowner.  The landowner sued, and Lord Coke held the \ncommissioners acted unlawfully because they were sup-\nposed to assess repair costs to \u201call who had land in dan-\nger.\u201d  Id. at 210.  Coke explained that while \u201c[t]he \nwords of the commission [gave] authority to the commis-\nsioners to do according to their discretions,\u201d the com-\nmissioners could \u201cnot [act] according to their wills and \nprivate affections\u201d but rather were \u201climited and bound \nwith the rule of reason and law.\u201d  Id. at 210.  Thus, the \ndiscretion possessed by the commissioners was merely \nthe discretion \u201cto discern between falsity and truth.\u201d  \nIbid.  In other words, the commissioners had the \npower to determine whose land was truly endangered by \ndamaged riverbanks, but they could not use that discre-\ntion to make policy judgments about which landowners \nshould bear the cost of repairing those banks.  See \nHAMBURGER, IS ADMINISTRATIVE LAW UNLAWFUL,  \nsupra, at 97-100 (describing the nature of assessments \nat common law). \nLike the common law assessors, the tax assessors at \nthe founding had discretion merely \u201cto discern between \nfalsity and truth\u201d in property values.  Rooke\u2019s Case, 77 \nEng. Rep. at 210.  Federal officials assumed all prop-\nerty had a \u201ccorrect valuation.\u201d  Parrillo, New Evi-\n\n72a \n \ndence, supra, at 1366 (quoting OLIVER WOLCOTT, JR., \nDIRECT TAXES 441 (1796)).  The task of officials exe-\ncuting the direct tax was merely to make the factual de-\nterminations necessary to unearth that correct valua-\ntion.  Congress told the assessors to do this \u201cjust[ly] \nand equitab[ly]\u201d\u2014\u201ca familiar measure of the conduct of \ngovernment officials making judicial or judicial-like de-\nterminations, including assessments.\u201d  Hamburger, \nNondelegation Blues, supra, at 1212.  The assessors \naccordingly had no power to make tax policy, at least not \nlegitimately.  And the kinds of factual findings Con-\ngress charged the assessors with making have never \nbeen thought to involve legislative power.  See, e.g., \nPanama Refin., 293 U.S. at 426 (\u201c[A]uthorizations given \nby Congress to selected instrumentalities for the pur-\npose of ascertaining the existence of facts to which leg-\nislation is directed have constantly been sustained.\u201d). \nIt is possible that assessors sometimes mischaracter-\nized the value of property so as to shift the tax burden \nfrom one group of citizens to another.  See Hamburger, \nNondelegation Blues, supra, at 1212 (noting \u201cassess-\nments and other determinations of fact have often been \nmisused to exercise a disguised legislative power\u201d).  If \nthat is right, some assessors may have exercised will ra-\nther than judgment and so acted in a legislative rather \nthan an executive capacity.  But in doing so, the asses-\nsors abused the power the 1798 Congress gave them, \nand abuses of a power do not change the nature of the \npower itself.  For example, it is commonly said that the \nSupreme Court in Lochner abused the judicial power.  \nSee, e.g., Kermit Roosevelt III, What if Slaughter-\nHouse had been Decided Differently?, 45 IND. L. REV. \n61, 84 (2011) (noting in Lochner the court committed \n\u201cthe sin  . . .  of substituting judicial for legislative \n\n73a \n \npolicymaking\u201d).  But no one contends that in light of \nLochner\u2019s abuses the Court in fact exercises legislative \npower when it rules in constitutional cases.  So too with \nthe assessors. \nThus, we can find no historical precedent for broad \ndelegations of Congress\u2019s power to tax.  But even if \nthere were\u2014even if the 1798 direct tax suggests Con-\ngress may delegate the Taxing Power to the Executive \nBranch\u2014there is still no historical precedent for the \nUSF Tax.  That is because it is utterly inconceivable \nthat the first Treasury, upon receiving from Congress \nbroad powers to levy taxes on American citizens, would \nhave abdicated responsibility for determining tax rates \nto privately employed bounty hunters who had a per-\nsonal financial interest in the amount of tax revenue col-\nlected.  And that is exactly what FCC has done here. \nSee supra, Part III.C. \nAccordingly, USF\u2019s double-layered delegation \u201cis an \ninnovation with no foothold in history or tradition.\u201d  \nSeila L., 591 U.S. at 222. \nb. \nIn addition to being a historical anomaly, USF\u2019s  \ndouble-layered delegation \u201cis incompatible with our con-\nstitutional structure.\u201d  Ibid. \nBoth the public and the private nondelegation doc-\ntrines exist to ensure that Congress exercises its legis-\nlative powers\u2014the greatest of the powers vested by the \nConstitution in the federal government\u2014\u201cin a way that \ncomports with the People\u2019s will.\u201d23  Jarkesy, 34 F.4th at \n \n23 The private nondelegation doctrine also likely applies to dele-\ngations of the executive power to private entities, see Amtrak II, \n \n\n74a \n \n459; see THE FEDERALIST NO. 51 (J. Madison) (\u201cA de-\npendence on the people is, no doubt, the primary control \non the government[.]\u201d).  As we previously noted: \nEvery member of Congress is accountable to his or \nher constituents through regular popular elections. \nAnd a duly elected Congress may exercise the legis-\nlative power only through the assent of two sepa-\nrately constituted chambers (bicameralism) and the \napproval of the President (presentment).  This pro-\ncess, cumbersome though it may often seem to eager \nonlookers, ensures that the People can be heard and \nthat their representatives have deliberated before \nthe strong hand of the federal government raises to \nchange the rights and responsibilities attendant to \nour public life. \nJarkesy, 34 F.4th at 459-60 (citations and footnote omit-\nted).  \u201cBut that accountability evaporates if a person or \nentity other than Congress,\u201d whether public or private, \n\u201cexercises legislative power.\u201d  Id. at 460 (citation omit-\nted). \nBroad congressional delegations to the executive un-\ndermine democratic accountability for at least three rea-\n \n575 U.S. at 62 (Alito, J., concurring) (\u201c[I]t raises \u2018difficult and fun-\ndamental questions\u2019 about the \u2018delegation of Executive power\u2019 when \nCongress authorizes citizen suits.\u201d) (quoting Friends of the Earth, \nInc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, \n197 (2000) (Kennedy, J., concurring), but petitioners did not raise \nan Article II challenge.  If they had, we might also conclude that \nFCC has unconstitutionally delegated the executive power to pri-\nvate entities.  See Consumers\u2019 Rsch, 88 F.4th at 934 (Newsom, J., \nconcurring) (\u201c[I]t seems obvious to me that in collecting de facto \ntaxes and distributing benefits USAC is exercising \u2018executive\u2019 \npower.\u201d). \n\n75a \n \nsons.  First, they allow Congress to circumvent the \n\u201cmany accountability checkpoints\u201d inherent in the Con-\nstitutional lawmaking process.  Amtrak II, 575 U.S. at \n61 (Alito, J., concurring).  Second, they obscure lines of \naccountability the Framers intended to be clear.  See \nGundy, 588 U.S. at 155 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting) (\u201c[B]y \ndirecting that legislating be done only by elected repre-\nsentatives in a public process, the Constitution sought \nto ensure that the lines of accountability would be clear:  \nThe sovereign people would know, without ambiguity, \nwhom to hold accountable for the laws they would have \nto follow.\u201d); id. at 156 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting) (\u201cLegis-\nlators might seek to take credit for addressing a press-\ning social problem by sending it to the executive for res-\nolution, while at the same time blaming the executive for \nthe problems that attend whatever measures he chooses \nto pursue.  In turn, the executive might point to Con-\ngress as the source of the problem.  These opportuni-\nties for finger-pointing might prove temptingly advan-\ntageous for the politicians involved, but they would also \nthreaten to disguise responsibility for the decisions.\u201d  \n(citations and quotation omitted)).  And third, they \nrender the promise of recourse to the judiciary illusory \nbecause they give reviewing courts no standard against \nwhich to measure the compatibility of executive action \nwith the prescriptions of the people\u2019s elected represent-\natives.  See id. at 167-68 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting) (not-\ning the similarity of the questions raised in vagueness \nchallenges and delegation challenges). \nDelegations to private entities undermine accounta-\nbility for different reasons.  Most obviously, private \nentities are \u201cneither legally nor politically accountable \nto  . . .  government officials or to the electorate.\u201d  \nLarkin, The Private Delegation Doctrine, supra, at 20; \n\n76a \n \nsee Black, 53 F.4th at 880 (\u201c[I]f people outside govern-\nment could wield the government\u2019s power[ ]then the \ngovernment\u2019s promised accountability to the people \nwould be an illusion.\u201d).  Unlike officers of the United \nStates, who \u201cmust take an oath or affirmation to support \nthe Constitution,\u201d Amtrak II, 575 U.S. at 57 (Alito, J., \nconcurring) (citing U.S. CONST. art. VI, cl. 3), directors \nof private entities owe no fealty to the Constitution and \ninstead owe legal obligations to their shareholders.  \nSee 2 BUS. & COM. LITIG. FED. CTS. \u00a7 13:77 (5th ed.) \n(\u201cUnder Delaware law, directors, officers, and control-\nling shareholders owe a duty of loyalty to the company \nand to its shareholders or owners.\u201d).  Moreover, \u201cpass-\ning off a Government operation as an independent pri-\nvate concern\u201d allows \u201cGovernment officials [to] wield \npower without owning up to the consequences\u201d because \nthe people might not associate bad results with the Gov-\nernment at all.  Amtrak II, 575 U.S. at 57 (Alito, J., \nconcurring). \nUSF combines these features, meaning accountabil-\nity is undermined twice over.  First, the public cannot \ntell whether it is being taxed by the FCC or USAC.  \nSee Universal Service, UNIVERSAL SERV. ADMIN. CO., \nsupra (\u201cUsing information from universal service pro-\ngram participants, USAC estimates how much money \nwill be needed each quarter to provide universal service \nsupport.\u201d  (emphasis added)).  And if some sleuthing \nmember of the public suspected the federal government \nwas behind the mysterious USF charge on his phone \nbill, how could he determine which governmental official \nto blame?  Not only could Congress and FCC point fin-\ngers at each other, see Gundy, 588 U.S. at 156 (Gorsuch, \nJ., dissenting), but both could offload responsibility onto \nthe private entities (USAC and its private, for-profit, \n\n77a \n \nconstituents) to which FCC delegated the USF Tax \nwithout congressional authorization.  See Free Enter. \nFund, 561 U.S. at 497-98 (\u201cThe diffusion of power car-\nries with it a diffusion of accountability  . . .  Without \na clear and effective chain of command, the public can-\nnot determine on whom the blame or the punishment of \na pernicious measure, or series of pernicious measures \nought really to fall.\u201d  (citation omitted)).  And even as \ngovernment officials are immunized from public over-\nsight by this \u201cMatryoshka doll\u201d of delegations and sub-\ndelegations, id. at 497, important governmental respon-\nsibilities are carried out by private entities with a legal \nobligation not to serve the public but rather to reap prof-\nits from it.  And last but not least, reviewing courts are \nhandicapped from redressing the injuries of aggrieved \ncitizens by the complete absence of a judicially workable \nstandard in 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254. \nThus, just as the added layer of tenure protection at \nissue in Free Enterprise Fund \u201cma[de] a difference\u201d to \nthe President\u2019s ability control the executive branch, id. \nat 495, so too do the myriad obfuscations of the USF Tax \nmake a difference to the Legislative Vesting Clause.  \nAccordingly, we hold that the universal service contri-\nbution mechanism\u2019s double-layered delegation \u201cis in-\ncompatible with our constitutional structure.\u201d  Seila \nL., 591 U.S. at 222. \nIV. \nFinally, a brief word about the dissenting opinions. \nThe principal dissent spills much ink on the distinction \nbetween fees and taxes only to conclude the distinction \ndoes not matter because all \u201crevenue-raising delega-\ntion[s]\u201d are the same.  Post, at 96 (Stewart, J., dissent-\ning).  And how does the Constitution permit double in-\n\n78a \n \nsulation of a revenue-raising delegation like the USF? \nThe principal dissent does not say. \nThe second dissenting opinion calls the majority \nopinion \nan \n\u201cunannounced\u201d \nand \n\u201cunprecedented\u201d \n\u201csleight of hand.\u201d  Post, at 98, 105 (Higginson, J., dis-\nsenting).  Worse, it is a usurpation that leaves \u201cthe po-\nlitical branches powerless to govern.\u201d  Post, at 101, \n105.  With deepest respect for our esteemed colleagues \nwho see this case differently, the dissenting opinion\u2019s le-\ngal authorities do not support its conclusions. \nFor example, it repeatedly accuses us of contraven-\ning Supreme Court precedent.  Post, at 98, 99, 100, 101, \n103, 105 (Higginson, J., dissenting).  But which prece-\ndent, precisely, are we flouting?  The dissenting opin-\nion does not say.  The closest it comes is to contend that \nthe Supreme Court has considered cases involving both \na \u201cdelegation of legislative power and a[ ] delegation of \ngovernment power to a private entity, yet the Court has \nnever instructed  . . .  that a different standard ap-\nplies.\u201d  Id. at 98-99 (Higginson, J., dissenting).  But in \nwhich case did the Supreme Court consider a double del-\negation problem like the one presented here?  The \nstatutory provision at issue in Carter Coal did not fea-\nture a combined public/private delegation; it delegated \npower directly to private enterprise.  See 298 U.S. at \n283-84.  And the Court found that violated the Consti-\ntution.  Id. at 311.  Having found that statute uncon-\nstitutional, it would have been quite peculiar for the \nCourt to proceed to render an advisory opinion on \nwhether a nonexistent double delegation would also vio-\nlate the Constitution. \nMeanwhile, in Currin and Sunshine Anthracite, the \nCourt found the Government had not delegated any leg-\n\n79a \n \nislative power to any private entity.  See Currin, 306 \nU.S. at 15 (\u201cSo far as growers of tobacco are concerned, \nthe required referendum does not involve any delega-\ntion of legislative authority.\u201d); Sunshine Anthracite, 310 \nU.S. at 399 (\u201cSince law-making is not entrusted to the \nindustry, this statutory scheme is unquestionably valid.\u201d).  \nThere cannot be a combined public/private delegation \nwithout a private delegation.  We obviously agree with \nour esteemed colleagues in dissent that Supreme Court \nprecedent binds us and binds us absolutely.  But we do \nnot understand how the dissenting opinions can say this \ncase is controlled by Supreme Court precedent without \ndisputing that the double delegation at issue here is un-\nprecedented. \nThe second dissenting opinion also contends we have \nmischaracterized the Supreme Court\u2019s separation-of-\npowers precedents.  On its telling, Seila Law does not \nevince a general principle that two constitutional parts \ncan converge to create an unconstitutional whole.  Ra-\nther, it says the Seila Law Court simply declined to rec-\nognize an exception to the President\u2019s removal power \nfor single principal officers who wield significant execu-\ntive authority.  Post, at 100 (Higginson, J., dissenting).  \nEven if that were right, it would not explain Free Enter-\nprise Fund.  In that case the Court unquestionably \nheld that two independently constitutional removal  \nrestrictions\u2014one that fit squarely within the Humph-\nrey\u2019s Executor exception, and one that fit squarely \nwithin the Morrison exception\u2014combined to create a \nconstitutional violation.  The dissenting opinion offers \nno explanation for that holding. \nFinally, the second dissenting opinion contends our \ndecision leaves the political branches \u201cpowerless to gov-\n\n80a \n \nern.\u201d  Post, at 105 (Higginson, J., dissenting).  That is \nquite an assertion, but with greatest respect, it is un-\ntrue.  Today\u2019s decision applies to a narrow question, \nimplicating just one federal program that is doubly in-\nsulated from political accountability.  The parties be-\nfore us have not pointed to other federal programs that \nhave the same or similar constitutional defects.  And as \nto the USF particularly, Congress could obviate the con-\nstitutional problem by simply ratifying USAC\u2019s deci-\nsions about how much American citizens should contrib-\nute to the goal of universal service.  Cf. Saikrishna \nBangalore Prakash, The Sky Will Not Fall:  Managing \nthe Transition to a Revitalized Nondelegation Doc-\ntrine, in THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE BEFORE THE SU-\nPREME COURT, supra, at 290 (\u201cLegislative ratification of \nagency law would wholly preclude a nondelegation chal-\nlenge[.]\u201d). \nThe second dissenting opinion contends otherwise \nbecause, in its view, the Federal Government will grind \nto a halt if Congress, or even FCC, were required to do \nmore than wield a Russian veto over the USF tax.  As \nevidence, it points to private contractors who perform \nministerial functions on behalf of the Centers for Medi-\ncare and Medicaid Services.  Post, at 103 (Higginson, \nJ., dissenting).  But if anything, Medicare and Medi-\ncaid prove the opposite.  Congress\u2014not a federal \nagency, and certainly not executives of private compa-\nnies\u2014decides how much Americans should be taxed to \nfund federal healthcare programs.  See, e.g., Louise \nSheiner, Lorae Stojanovic, & David Wessel, How does \nMedicare work?  And how is it financed?, BROOKINGS \n(Mar. 20, 2024), https://perma.cc/D7LN-DHYW (ex-\nplaining the Government\u2019s contributions to Medicare \ncome from a combination of general revenues and pay-\n\n81a \n \nroll taxes); 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101 (setting the Medicare pay-\nroll tax rate).  The unconstitutionality of the USF says \nnothing about other tax programs, like Medicare and \nMedicaid, that Congress administers. \n* * * \nAmerican telecommunications consumers are subject \nto a multi-billion-dollar tax nobody voted for.  The size \nof that tax is de facto determined by a trade group \nstaffed by industry insiders with no semblance of ac-\ncountability to the public.  And the trade group in turn \nrelies on projections made by its private, for-profit con-\nstituent companies, all of which stand to profit from \nevery single tax increase.  This combination of delega-\ntions, subdelegations, and obfuscations of the USF Tax \nmechanism offends Article I, \u00a7 1 of the Constitution. \nFor the foregoing reasons, we hold unconstitutional \nthe Q1 2022 USF Tax.  Accordingly, we GRANT the \npetition and REMAND to FCC for further proceedings. \n\n82a \n \nJENNIFER WALKER ELROD, Circuit Judge, joined by \nHO and ENGELHARDT, Circuit Judges, concurring: \nI concur in the majority opinion in full.  The major-\nity correctly and thoroughly identifies the concerns that \nmake this double delegation unconstitutional.  I write \nseparately to say that I would go one step further and \naddress the lawfulness of each individual delegation.  \nFor the reasons explained in the majority\u2019s thorough \nopinion, Congress\u2019s delegation of legislative power to \nthe FCC and the FCC\u2019s delegation of the taxing power \nto a private entity each individually contravene the sep-\naration of powers principle that undergirds our Consti-\ntutional Republic. \nAs James Madison put it, \u201c[t]he accumulation of all \npowers legislative, executive, and judiciary in the same \nhands,  . . .  may justly be pronounced the very defi-\nnition of tyranny.\u201d  Dep\u2019t of Transp. v. Ass\u2019n of Am. R.R., \n575 U.S. 43, 74 (2015) (Thomas, J., concurring) (quoting \nThe Federalist No. 47, p. 301 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961)); see \nalso Baron de Montesquieu, The Spirit of the Laws, bk. \nXI, ch. VI (1748) (\u201cWhen the legislative and executive \npowers are united in the same person, or in the same \nbody of magistrates, there can be no liberty; . . . .\u201d). \nTo ensure that the legislative power remains sepa-\nrate from the executive power, the Constitution \u201cpro-\nvides strict rules to ensure that Congress exercises the \nlegislative power in a way that comports with the Peo-\nple\u2019s will.\u201d  Jarkesy v. Sec. and Exch. Comm\u2019n, 34 \nF.4th 446, 459 (5th Cir. 2022) aff\u200a\u2019d, No. 22-859, 2024 WL \n3187811 (U.S. June 27, 2024).  Each member of Con-\ngress is accountable to his or her constituents through \nregular popular elections.  U.S. Const. art I, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3; id. \namend. XVII, cl. 1.  And Congress may exercise legis-\n\n83a \n \nlative power (including the power to tax) only by going \nthrough the arduous process of bicameralism and pre-\nsentment.  U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 7.  This \u201censures that \nthe People can be heard and that their representatives \nhave deliberated before the strong hand of the federal \ngovernment raises to change the rights and responsibil-\nities attendant to our public life.\u201d  Jarkesy, 34 F.4th at \n459-60.  Each of the delegations here, viewed inde-\npendently, violates this principle. \nJustifying the Congressional delegation on the \ngrounds that Congress has enlisted the \u201cexpertise\u201d of \nthe FCC in the undefined area of Universal Service \nrings hollow given that the FCC relies on the determi-\nnations of private industry leaders to determine the \nUSF tax. \nThe second dissent states that the federal govern-\nment is rendered \u201cpowerless to govern\u201d by the major-\nity\u2019s holding.  Post, at 101 (Higginson, J., dissenting).  \nThat is a non sequitur.  Congress can always act by \npassing duly enacted legislation through bicameralism \nand presentment.  The assertion that delegations of \nlegislative power are necessary for effective and effi-\ncient governance in the modern world does not author-\nize Congress to violate Article I, Section I\u2019s vesting \nclause.  Congress\u2019s inability to implement and oversee \nthe program itself might even suggest that the program \nshould not exist.  Regardless, Congress must imple-\nment, or at least approve, the USF tax.  That way, the \npower of the people to oversee those they have chosen \nto govern is rightfully restored.1 \n \n1  They are, after all, the ones ultimately footing the bill for Uni-\nversal Service. \n\n84a \n \nWith this in mind, I join the thorough and well-rea-\nsoned opinion of the court in full. \n\n85a \n \nJAMES C. HO, Circuit Judge, concurring: \nOur Constitution establishes three branches of gov-\nernment, not four.1  It vests \u201c[a]ll legislative Powers \nherein granted\u201d\u2014including the \u201cPower To lay and col-\nlect Taxes\u201d\u2014not in some unnamed fourth branch of gov-\nernment, but in \u201ca Congress of the United States,\u201d \nwhose members are chosen by and directly accountable \nto the people of the United States.  U.S. CONST. art. I, \n\u00a7\u00a7 1, 8.  So if we\u2019re serious about protecting our consti-\ntutional democracy, we must enforce the principle that \nall legislative powers like the power to tax are indeed \nexercised by the people we elect. \nThat\u2019s what our court does today.  We hold that the \ndelegation of Congress\u2019s taxing power, first to a federal \nagency, and then to a private entity, violates the Vesting \nClause of Article I.  I certainly concur. \nIn reaching this decision, the court distinguishes \nTexas v. Rettig, 987 F.3d 518 (5th Cir. 2021).  I would \nalso disavow Rettig altogether, for the reasons noted in \nTexas v. Rettig, 993 F.3d 408, 408 (5th Cir. 2021) (Ho, J., \ndissenting from denial of rehearing en banc). \nThe delegations of taxing authority at issue in Rettig \npresent the same challenges to our constitutional  \ndemocracy\u2014and to the founding principle of taxation \nwithout representation\u2014that are presented here.  It\u2019s \njust as true in Rettig as it is here that \u201c[t]he right to vote \n \n1  See, e.g., Ameron, Inc. v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 787 \nF.2d 875, 892 (3rd Cir. 1986) (Becker, J., concurring) (\u201cThe Consti-\ntution establishes three branches of government, not four.\u201d); Ass\u2019n \nof American Railroads v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Transp., 821 F.3d 19, 30-31 \n(D.C. Cir. 2016) (various provisions of \u201cour Constitution  . . .  \nwere designed for a government of three branches, not four\u201d). \n\n86a \n \nmeans nothing if we abandon our constitutional commit-\nments and allow the real work of lawmaking to be exer-\ncised by private interests colluding with agency bureau-\ncrats, rather than by elected officials accountable to the \nAmerican voter.\u201d  Id. at 410-11. \nAnd both in Rettig and here, the threats to democ-\nracy presented by the administrative state are not inad-\nvertent, but intentional\u2014a deliberate design to turn \nconsent of the governed into an illusion.  \u201c[T]he expan-\nsion of the electorate has been accompanied by the \ngrowth of administrative law.  . . .  [W]hether in \n1870, 1920, or 1965  . . .  each time, after representa-\ntive government became more open to the people, legis-\nlative power increasingly has been sequestered to a part \nof government that is largely closed to them.\u201d  PHILIP \nHAMBURGER, IS ADMINISTRATIVE LAW UNLAWFUL?  \n369 (2014).  \u201c[A]lthough [members of the knowledge \nclass] mostly supported expanded suffrage, they also \nsupported the removal of legislative power to adminis-\ntrative agencies staffed by persons who shared their \noutlook.\u201d  Id. at 374.  \u201cThe development of adminis-\ntrative power thus  . . .  must be recognized as  . . .  \na profoundly disturbing shift of power.  As soon as the \npeople secured the power to vote, a new class cordoned \noff for themselves a sort of legislative power that they \ncould exercise without representation.\u201d  Id.  Another \nscholar put it this way:  \u201cHowever much [administra-\ntive] agencies may emphasize their formal openness, in \npractice well-organized, directly interested parties dom-\ninate comment processes.  Normal people do not per-\nceive these proceedings as \u2018democratic.\u2019\u200a\u201d  PHILIP A. \nWALLACH, WHY CONGRESS? 231 (2023).  With Con-\ngress, \u201cthe electorate still has the chance, crude as it \nmay be, to pass judgment on the elected official and con-\n\n87a \n \nvince other members of their community of the im-\nportance of doing so. Against . . . the bureaucracy, citi-\nzens have no such recourse.\u201d Id. \nWe devote significant energy and resources to secur-\ning the right to vote for every citizen.  But that right \nmatters only if our elected officials matter.  There\u2019s no \npoint in voting if the real power rests in the hands of \nunelected bureaucrats\u2014or their private delegates.  If \nyou believe in democracy, then you should oppose an ad-\nministrative state that shields government action from \naccountability to the people.  I concur. \n\n88a \n \nCARL E. STEWART, Circuit Judge, joined by RICHMAN, \nChief Judge, and SOUTHWICK, HAYNES, GRAVES, HIG-\nGINSON, and DOUGLAS, Circuit Judges, dissenting: \nI dissent because the Universal Service Fund \n(\u201cUSF\u201d) is not unconstitutional.  Section 254 of the Tel-\necommunications Act of 1996 provides an intelligible \nprinciple and the Federal Communications Commission \n(\u201cFCC\u201d) maintains control over the Universal Service \nAdministrative Company (\u201cUSAC\u201d), the private entity \nentrusted to aid its administration of the USF.  The \nmajority\u2019s exhaustive exegesis about policy, history, and \nassorted doctrines does not eclipse the consistent hold-\ning of three sister circuits that have addressed constitu-\ntional challenges to Section 254.  All have held it con-\nstitutional under the intelligible principle test.  The \nmajority has created a split in a sweeping opinion that \n(1) crafts an amorphous new standard to analyze dele-\ngations, (2) overturns\u2014without much fanfare\u2014circuit \nprecedent holding that this program collects adminis-\ntrative fees and not taxes, (3) blurs the distinction be-\ntween taxes and fees, and (4) rejects established admin-\nistrative law principles and all evidence to the contrary \nto create a private nondelegation doctrine violation. \nI.  THE NONDELEGATION DOCTRINE \nPetitioners and the majority contend that \u00a7 254 vio-\nlates the nondelegation doctrine.  Notably, the Su-\npreme Court has denied petitions for review of the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s and the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s decisions rejecting \nthese contentions.  Consumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, No.  \n23-456, 2024 WL 2883753 (U.S. June 10, 2024) (Mem.); \nConsumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, No. 23-743, 2024 WL 2883755 \n(U.S. June 10, 2024) (Mem.).  In line with our col-\nleagues in the Sixth, Eleventh, and D.C. Circuits, I \n\n89a \n \nwould reject this challenge and hold that \u00a7 254 satisfies \nthe intelligible principle test as articulated by the Su-\npreme Court. \na.  Section 254 Sufficiently Delimits the  \nFCC\u2019s Discretion \nThe nondelegation doctrine is based on the central \nprinciple that the separation of powers underlies our \nsystem of Government.  See Mistretta v. United States, \n488 U.S. 361, 371 (1989).  Article I, Section 1 of the U.S. \nConstitution provides that \u201c[a]ll legislative Powers \nherein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the \nUnited States.\u201d  U.S. CONST., art. I, \u00a7 1.  The Court \nhas long acknowledged that Congress \u201cmay confer sub-\nstantial discretion on executive agencies to implement \nand enforce the laws\u201d where it \u201chas supplied an intelli-\ngible principle to guide the delegee\u2019s use of discretion.\u201d  \nGundy v. United States, 588 U.S. 128, 135 (2019) (plu-\nrality opinion) (emphasis added).  It has consistently \nheld that a delegation is constitutional if \u201cCongress has \nsupplied an intelligible principle to guide the delegee\u2019s \nuse of discretion.\u201d  Id. at 2123.  Under this frame-\nwork, the Court has approved narrow and broad delega-\ntions, acknowledging that \u201cin our increasingly complex \nsociety, replete with ever changing and more technical \nproblems, Congress simply cannot do its job absent an \nability to delegate power under broad general direc-\ntives.\u201d  Mistretta, 488 U.S. at 372; see Am. Power Light \n& Co. v. SEC, 329 U.S. 90, 105 (1946) (\u201cThe judicial ap-\nproval accorded [to] these \u2018broad\u2019 standards for admin-\nistrative action is a reflection of the necessities of mod-\nern legislation dealing with complex economic and social \nproblems.\u201d); Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v. Adkins, \n310 U.S. 381, 398 (1940).  It has further explained that \n\n90a \n \nthe nondelegation inquiry \u201calways begins (and often al-\nmost ends) with statutory interpretation.\u201d  Gundy, 588 \nU.S. at 135. \nAs such, we begin our nondelegation inquiry not with \na long discourse about the history of the USF\u2019s short-\ncomings, but with statutory interpretation.  See id.  \nIn 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254, Congress clearly set out both the \ngeneral policy\u2014ensuring \u201c[a]ccess to advanced telecom-\nmunications and information services [are] provided in \nall regions of the Nation,\u201d id. at \u00a7 254(b)(2)\u2014and the \nagency entrusted to execute that policy, the FCC, see \nAm. Power, 329 U.S. at 105.  All that leaves is the ques-\ntion of whether Congress delineated \u201cthe boundaries of \nthis delegated authority.\u201d  Id.  Petitioners argue that \nbecause \u00a7 254 sets no definite limits on how much the \nFCC can raise for the USF that it lacks any concrete, \nobjective guidance limiting this authority.  The Court \nhas rejected this argument in several formulations in \nchallenges to delegations implicating the authority to \nraise revenue.  See, e.g., Skinner v. Mid-Am. Pipeline \nCo., 490 U.S. 212, 222-23 (1989); J.W. Hampton, Jr., & \nCo. v. United States, 276 U.S. 394, 409 (1928).  For sim-\nilar reasons, Petitioners\u2019 argument should fail here.  \nExamining the plain language of \u00a7 254, it becomes clear \nthat Congress has sufficiently limited the FCC\u2019s ability \nto raise revenue in a way other than imposing a statu-\ntory cap on how much can be raised. \nSection 254(b) lays out the principles that the FCC \nmust adhere to.  It sets out the specific directive that \nthe FCC \u201cshall [create] policies for the preservation and \nadvancement of universal service.\u201d  47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(b) \n(emphasis added).  It further establishes that the FCC \nis required to do so pursuant to certain enumerated \n\n91a \n \nprinciples that:  \u201cquality services should be made avail-\nable at just and reasonable rates; advanced services \nshould be provided to the entire United States; and \u2018low-\nincome consumers and those in rural, insular, and high \ncost areas\u2019 should have access to advanced services at \nreasonably comparable rates to those in urban areas.\u201d  \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(b)(1)-(3).  Section 254(b)(5) limits the \nFCC to only enact universal service policies that are \n\u201cspecific, predictable and sufficient\u201d to \u201cpreserve and \nadvance universal service.\u201d  Id. 254(b)(5).  The stat-\nute further charges telecommunications carriers with \nthe duty to provide access that meets minimum stand-\nards of universal service to \u201c[e]lementary and secondary \nschools and classrooms, healthcare providers, and li-\nbraries.\u201d  Id. 254(b)(6). \nAs the panel noted, \u00a7 254(b)(7) \u201cenables, and likely \nobligates, [the FCC] to add principles \u2018consistent with\u2019  \n\u00a7 254\u2019s overall purpose.\u201d  Consumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, 63 \nF.4th 441, 448 (5th Cir. 2023) (quoting 47 U.S.C.  \n\u00a7 254(b)(7)), reh\u2019g en banc granted, opinion vacated, 72 \nF.4th 107 (5th Cir.).  In line with our colleagues at the \nSixth Circuit, I view \u00a7 254(b) as Congress laying out \u201ca \nhigh-level goal for universal service\u201d and then going fur-\nther to \u201cenumerate[] specific principles of universal ser-\nvice.\u201d  Consumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, 67 F.4th 773, 790-91 \n(6th Cir. 2023), cert. denied, 2024 WL 2883753 (June 10, \n2024) (Mem.).  Section 254(b) contains limiting princi-\nples that impose \u201ca mandatory duty on the FCC\u201d to con-\nsider the listed universal service principles when it up-\ndates its universal service policies.  Qwest Corp. v. \nFCC, 258 F.3d 1191, 1200 (10th Cir. 2001); see, e.g., Con-\nsumers\u2019 Rsch., 67 F.4th at 791; Consumers\u2019 Rsch., 88 \nF.4th 917, 924 (11th Cir. 2023), cert. denied, 2024 WL \n2883755 (June 10, 2024) (Mem.).  By its plain language, \n\n92a \n \nCongress ordered in \u00a7 254 that the FCC \u201cshall base pol-\nicies for the preservation and advancement of universal \nservice on the principles\u201d enumerated in \u00a7 254(b).  47 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 254(b).  This imposition of a duty to weigh the \nenumerated universal service principles is reminiscent \nof constitutional statutory delegations that provided an \nintelligible principle in the form of \u201cguidance that the \n[agency] cannot disregard.\u201d  Allstates Refractory Con-\ntractors, LLC v. Su, 79 F.4th 755, 775 (6th Cir. 2023) \n(Nalbandian, J., dissenting) (citing Mistretta, 488 U.S. \nat 375-76). \nReading \u00a7 254(b)\u2019s provisions together, as our sister \ncircuits have, \u201cindicates that Congress required that the \nFCC base its efforts to preserve and advance universal \nservice on the enumerated principles while allowing the \nFCC to then \u2018balance [each] principle[] against one an-\nother when they conflict.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Consumers\u2019 Rsch., 67 F.4th \nat 791 (quoting Qwest Corp., 258 F.3d at 1200); see also \nTex.

Nor does it \u201cstrip away the intelli-\ngible principle and the limits on the FCC\u2019s discretion \nthat Congress imposed in the first six principles and \nthroughout\u201d the remainder of \u00a7 254\u2019s other provisions.  \nSee Consumers\u2019 Rsch. v.

See Gundy, 588 U.S. at 136. \n\n94a \n \n2001) is misplaced.  A closer look at TOPUC II reveals \nhow a strained interpretation of our prior utterances \ndoes not support a determination that \u00a7 254 contains \u201cno \nguidance whatsoever.\u201d  Jarkesy v. SEC, 34 F.4th 446, \n462 (5th Cir. 2022), cert. granted, 143 S. Ct. 2688 (2023). \nIn TOPUC II, we examined whether the FCC\u2019s \nCALLS Order, which raised a price cap on the amount \nthat \u201cend-users of basic local service,\u201d 265 F.3d at 318, \npaid on their telephone bills, violated \u00a7 254\u2019s \u201crequire-\nment of affordable universal access.\u201d  Id. at 320.  Un-\ndertaking a Chevron analysis, we asked \u201cwhether Con-\ngress has spoken directly on the precise question at is-\nsue,\u201d and then turned to whether the FCC\u2019s interpreta-\ntion of \u00a7 254 was based upon a permissible construction.  \nId. at 320-21.  Notably, we did not evaluate the consti-\ntutionality of Congress\u2019s delegation there, but consid-\nered whether the Order\u2019s price cap violated the Act\u2019s \nprinciples of ensuring \u201cjust, reasonable, and affordable \nrates\u201d of universal service.  Id. at 321 (quoting 47 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 254(b)(1), (i)).  Given the full scope of our prior \ninterpretation of \u00a7 254(b), Petitioners\u2019 overreliance on \nthese unrelated considerations to carry the day in a non-\ndelegation doctrine inquiry is unfounded. \nSection 254\u2019s other provisions provide further checks \non the FCC\u2019s discretion.  Section 254(c) limits the FCC \nin determining which telecommunications services will \nreceive support from the USF.  In \u00a7 254(c)(1), Con-\ngress specifically ordered the FCC to revise its defini-\ntion of supported services only to account for \u201cadvances \nin telecommunications and information technologies and \nservices.\u201d  Some have said that \u00a7 254(c) does not limit \nthe FCC\u2019s discretion to raise revenue because it only ad-\ndresses the spending of USF money.  However, that \n\n95a \n \ncontention neglects the direct link between the collec-\ntion of universal service contributions and the disburse-\nment of USF money.  Section 254(d) requires \u201ctelecom-\nmunications carrier[s] that provide[] interstate telecom-\nmunications services\u201d to \u201ccontribute, on an equitable \nand nondiscriminatory basis\u201d to the \u201cmechanisms estab-\nlished by the [FCC] to preserve and advance universal \nservice.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 254(d).2  As the FCC points out, the less \nmoney the telecommunications carriers require to effec-\ntively provide universal service results in \u201cless revenue \nthe FCC must raise to finance those mechanisms.\u201d \nWith respect to dispersing any money from the USF, \nthe FCC is restricted to dispersing credits to statutorily \ndesignated eligible telecommunications carriers that \nprovide support for universal services.  Id. \u00a7 254(e); see \nTOPUC I, 183 F.3d at 412 (\u201cThe term \u2018sufficient\u2019 ap-\npears in \u00a7 254(e), and the plain language of \u00a7 254(e) \nmakes sufficiency of universal service support a direct \nstatutory command rather than a statement of one of \nseveral principles.\u201d  (emphasis added)).  On more than \none occasion, we have held that \u00a7 254(e) \u201crequires that \nuniversal service support be \u2018explicit and sufficient.\u2019\u200a\u201d  \nAlenco, 201 F.3d at 614 (emphasis added).  As a practi-\ncal matter, it is worth noting that USF program dis-\nbursements have \u201cremained relatively stable over the \npast decade\u201d and even decreased from 2012 to 2020.  \nFCC, FCC 22-67, REPORT ON THE FUTURE OF THE UNI-\n \n2  As I explain in Part III, infra, that telecommunications carriers \ntypically pass through the cost of their quarterly contributions in \nthe form of line-item charges on consumers\u2019 bills on their own voli-\ntion is irrelevant to our constitutional analysis.  Cf. J.W. Hamp-\nton, 276 U.S. at 406 (describing that Congress\u2019s delegations must \nbe analyzed for the specificity and extent of vestment of discretion \nyielded to the appropriate co-ordinate branch of government). \n\n96a \n \nVERSAL SERVICE FUND 10084-85, \u00b6 92 (Aug. 15, 2022) \n(\u201cReport to Congress\u201d).  This fact flatly contradicts \nPetitioners\u2019 assertions that the FCC has acted from a \nposition \u201cthat it has a free hand to overcharge\u201d for uni-\nversal service.  Thus, I would deny the petition for re-\nview because \u00a7 254 satisfies the intelligible principle test \nas articulated by the Supreme Court. \nb. Section 254\u2019s Context, Purpose, and History \nIn Gundy, the Court stated that the intelligible prin-\nciple analysis requires examination of \u201c[t]he [statute\u2019s] \ntext, considered alongside its context, purpose, and his-\ntory.\u201d  588 U.S. at 136.  Congress\u2019s consistent intention \nto preserve and advance universal service for nearly a \ncentury, 3 combined with \u00a7 254\u2019s articulated purpose \nprovide further evidence of the existence of an intelligi-\nble principle.  Consumers\u2019 Rsch., 67 F.4th at 790-95; \nsee Am. Power, 329 U.S. at 104; TOPUC I, 183 F.3d at \n405-06.  The majority\u2019s disagreement with Congress\u2019s \npolicy choices, Maj. Op. at 26, does not transform the \nUSF into a constitutional or statutory violation.  See \nConsumers\u2019 Rsch., 63 F.4th at 449 n.4.  As the panel \nheld, \u00a7 254 does not leave the FCC with \u201cno guidance \nwhatsoever,\u201d id. at 448-49, and more befittingly, it ac-\ncords with the statute\u2019s purpose, and \u201cCongress\u2019s his-\ntory of pursuing universal service\u201d to clearly enunciate \nan intelligible principle that sufficiently cabins the \n \n3  Congress passed the FCC\u2019s organic statute in 1934 and mod-\nernized the agency\u2019s regulatory role in passing the Telecommuni-\ncations Act of 1994 \u201cto make available, so far as possible, to all the \npeople of the United States, without discrimination on the basis of \nrace, color, religion, national origin, or sex, a rapid, efficient, Na-\ntion-wide, and world-wide wire and radio communication service \nwith adequate facilities at reasonable charges.\u201d  47 U.S.C. \u00a7 151. \n\n97a \n \nFCC\u2019s discretion.  See Consumers\u2019 Rsch., 67 F.4th at \n795; Gundy, 588 U.S. at 135-36.  In sum, I would hold \nthat the context, purpose, and history surrounding \u00a7 254 \nevinces a clear intelligible principle delimiting agency \ndiscretion. \nII.  THE PRIVATE NONDELEGATION DOCTRINE \nAn agency may obtain the assistance of private par-\nties in implementing its mandate under federal law so \nlong as those private parties are subordinate to the \nagency and subject to the agency\u2019s \u201csurveillance\u201d and \nguidance.  Adkins, 310 U.S. at 388, 399; see also Bo-\nerschig v. Trans-Pecos Pipeline, LLC, 872 F.3d 701, 708 \n(5th Cir. 2017) (noting same).  Petitioners and the ma-\njority assert however, that the FCC \u201creflexively rub-\nberstamps\u201d USAC\u2019s proposals to determine the contri-\nbution rates charged to telecommunications carriers.  \nThey further posit that USAC maintains final decision-\nmaking power because \u201cthe FCC has never reversed \nUSAC\u2019s projections of demand.\u201d  Neither of these ar-\nguments is supported by the statute or applicable regu-\nlations nor do they consider well-established principles \nof administrative law.  As described below, these argu-\nments follow from misstatements of record facts. \nThe FCC determines a quarterly contribution factor \n\u201cbased on the ratio of total projected quarterly expenses \nof the universal service support mechanisms to the total \nend-user interstate and international telecommunica-\ntions revenues.\u201d  47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.709(a)(2).  Sixty days \nin advance of this determination, USAC submits its \n\u201cprojections of demand\u201d\u2014the projected expenses to en-\nsure the operation of the USF programs\u2014to the FCC.  \nId. \u00a7 54.709(a)(3).  These projections of demand for \nUSF support are subject to the FCC\u2019s imposed caps.  \n\n98a \n \nSee, e.g., Interim Cap Order, 23 FCC Rcd. 8834 (2008) \n(adopting caps on disbursements of USF contributions \nthat eligible telecommunications carriers may receive to \n\u201crein in the explosive growth in high-cost universal ser-\nvice support disbursements\u201d).  Considering the FCC\u2019s \nlimitations on USAC\u2019s proposed \u201cprojections of de-\nmand,\u201d USAC compiles the total revenues and expenses \nof the contributing carriers based on their Reporting \nWorksheets.  47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.709(a)(2).  These work-\nsheets, created by the FCC, id. \u00a7 54.711, must be sub-\nmitted for review at least thirty days before the start of \nthe quarter.  Id. \u00a7 54.709(a)(2).  USAC then calculates \nthe contribution factor from the Reporting Worksheets \nand then the ratio is publicly noticed and made available \non the FCC\u2019s website.  See id. \u00a7 54.709(a)(3).  The \nFCC then may approve the projections or administra-\ntive expense estimates or exercise its \u201cright to set pro-\njections of demand and administrative expenses.\u201d  Id.  \nWhere the FCC does not act within fourteen days of the \nrelease of the projections of demand, then the projec-\ntions and contributions are deemed approved by the \nFCC.  Id. \nThe USF and its programs receive funding only after \nthe execution of a detailed, multistep process devised by \nthe FCC.  Petitioners and the majority assert that this \nframework is evidence that the FCC merely sits on its \nhands while USAC drives the boat in determining how \nmuch is raised.  This ignores the established principle \nthat \u201can agency exercises its policymaking discretion \nwith equal force when it makes policy by either \u2018de-\ncid[ing] to act\u2019 or \u2018decid[ing] not to act.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Consumers\u2019 \nRsch., 67 F.4th at 796 (quoting Oklahoma v. United \nStates, 62 F.4th 221, 230 (6th Cir. 2023)).  Significantly, \nthe structural relationship between the agency and the \n\n99a \n \nprivate party is the focus of the private nondelegation \ndoctrine inquiry.  See Texas v. Rettig, 987 F.3d 518, 531 \n(5th Cir. 2021).  A closer look at the relationship here \nleads to the conclusion that the FCC has not ceded con-\ntrol of the USF to USAC. \nUSAC is fully subordinate to the FCC as its functions \nare strictly ministerial.  See Consumers\u2019 Rsch., 63 \nF.4th at 451-52.  Here is a short list of what USAC can \ndo.  USAC is tasked with \u201cbilling contributors, collect-\ning contributions to the universal service support mech-\nanisms, and disbursing universal service support \nfunds.\u201d  47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.702(b).  It collects information \nand facts from the contributing telecommunications \ncompanies and tabulates the companies\u2019 contribution \nfactors based on that information and the formulas that \nthe FCC furnishes for USAC to apply.  See, e.g., 47 \nC.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 54.1304(b) (establishing formula to calculate \nsafety net additive support), 54.901(a) (explaining Con-\nnect \nAmerica \nFund \nBroadband \nLoop \nSupport), \n54.303(a)(1) (setting formula to determine total eligible \noperating expenses), 54.702(n).  USAC contribution \ndeterminations are mere proposals subject to govern-\nment approval.  See Consumers\u2019 Rsch., 88 F.4th at 927.  \nAs the Court held in Adkins, a private entity\u2019s partici-\npation in ministerial functions under the agency \u201cperva-\nsive surveillance and authority\u201d does not violate the \nConstitution.  310 U.S. at 388.  Here, all of this is done \nunder the FCC\u2019s watch and is conducted only with the \nFCC\u2019s approval.  See Universal Service Contribution \nMethodology, 34 FCC Rcd. 4143, 4144-45 (2019) (citing \nConnect America Fund, 26 FCC Rcd. 17663, 17847 \n(2011)) (directing USAC to make specific contribution \ncollections \u201cregardless of the projected quarterly de-\nmand\u201d calculated from the FCC-supplied formulas). \n\n100a \n \nWith respect to the FCC\u2019s control over USAC, the \nlist of what USAC cannot do is instructive.  USAC can-\nnot make policy.  47 C.F.R \u00a7 54.702(c).  It cannot in-\nterpret unclear provisions or rules.  Id.  It cannot uni-\nlaterally give its proposals the force of law.  47 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 54.709(a)(2).  The very agency action addressed in \nthe instant petition for review is the FCC\u2019s \u201cProposed \nFirst Quarter 2022 Universal Service Contribution Fac-\ntor.\u201d  Consequently, it is inaccurate to state that USAC \ndefinitively determines how much money the USF will \ncollect each quarter.  See 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.709(a)(3).  \nThe FCC is not bound by USAC\u2019s projections.  Id.  \nUSAC acts no differently than an advisor or policy aide \nthat proposes regulations subject to government ap-\nproval.  See Adkins, 310 U.S. at 388.  Upon receiving \nUSAC\u2019s proposals, the FCC issues a Public Notice, pub-\nlishing the proposed contribution factor and soliciting \npublic comment.  47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.709(a)(3). \nWhat occurs after the FCC approves the quarterly \ncontribution factor further supports the notion that \nUSAC is fully subservient to the FCC.  The FCC main-\ntains supervision and review over USAC proposals well \nafter it issues the approved quarterly contribution fac-\ntor.4  Any party that is aggrieved by a ministerial act \n \n4  Hospitals in rural areas and libraries and schools can apply for \ndiscounted telecommunications services under the E-Rate pro-\ngram.  47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(h)(1)(A)-(B).  The hospitals, schools, and \nlibraries must post their applications on USAC\u2019s website, undergo \na technology assessment, and comply with strenuous bidding re-\nquirements as outlined by the FCC.  See Bishop Perry Middle \nSch. New Orleans, 21 FCC Rcd. 5316, 5317-18 (2006) (listing the \nrequirements for the E-Rate program as set out by Congress in  \n\u00a7 254(h) and the FCC in 47 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 54.504, 54.511(a)).  Where a \nparty fails to comply with the statutory and regulatory require-\n \n\n101a \n \nof USAC\u2014typically the issuance of an invoice to collect \ncontributions\u2014may seek review from the FCC.  47 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 54.719(b); Universal Serv. Contribution Meth-\nodology, 31 FCC Rcd. 13220 (2016) (holding that USAC \novercharged Cisco WebEx through an improper reve-\nnue calculation).  The FCC quite routinely adjusts \nUSAC proposals that deny discount rate status to public \nlibraries and schools.  See, e.g., Streamlined Resol. of \nRequests Related to Actions by the Universal Serv. Ad-\nmin. Co., 37 FCC Rcd. 5442 (2022); Alpaugh Unified \nSch. Dist., 22 FCC Rcd. 6035, 6036-37 (2007) (remanding \nUSAC proposals that reduced or denied discounted \nrates to public libraries and schools for further fact find-\ning).  USAC is not charged with reviewing applications \nto receive subsidized universal service from qualified \nhospitals, libraries, low-income consumers, rural con-\nsumers, and schools.  The FCC fulfills that role.  See \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(h)(1)(A)-(B).  We could continue to il-\nlustrate the other places in \u00a7 254 and the Code of Fed-\neral Regulations that demonstrate that the FCC is in \nthe driver\u2019s seat.  But, all of this shows that the FCC \nmaintains complete control over USAC and holds final \ndecision-making authority regarding the USF and its \nprograms. \nA comparison to a recent case where we held that a \nviolation of the private nondelegation doctrine occurred \nfurther underscores this point.  Take our recent deci-\nsion in National Horsemen\u2019s Benevolent & Protective \n \nments necessary to obtain the discount, it may seek review with the \nFCC.  See generally id.  Notably, the FCC issues the final or-\nders that analyze the requests and either grants them outright, re-\nmands them to USAC for further fact-finding, or denies them.  \nSee id. at 5327-28 (ordering clauses). \n\n102a \n \nAss\u2019n v. Black, 53 F.4th 869 (5th Cir. 2022).  There, this \ncourt was confronted with Congress\u2019s delegation of rule-\nmaking authority to a private entity, the Horseracing \nIntegrity and Safety Authority (the \u201cAuthority\u201d).  Id. \nat 872.  The statute at issue \u201cnationalize[d] the govern-\nance of the thoroughbred horseracing industry,\u201d placing \nsubstantial unchecked rulemaking power in the Author-\nity\u2019s hands.  Id. at 872.  The statute ordered the  \nAuthority\u2014and not the Federal Trade Commission \n(\u201cFTC\u201d)\u2014to establish anti-doping, medication, and \nracetrack safety programs and a scheme of sanctions, \namong many other rules carrying the force of law.  Id. \nat 882-83.  The FTC was then required by statute to af-\nfirm the Authority\u2019s proposed regulations if deemed \nconsistent with the statute.  Id. at 884-85.  This essen-\ntially placed the FTC and the Authority on the same \nground with respect to enacting rules regulating the \nhorseracing industry that carried the force of law.  See \nid. at 883.  Specifically, we stated that \u201c[a]n agency \ndoes not have meaningful oversight if it does not write \nthe rules, cannot change them, and cannot second-guess \ntheir substance.\u201d  Id. at 872. \nThat is not the case here.  Unlike the FTC in Na-\ntional Horsemen\u2019s, the FCC sets the rules and policy \ndeterminations under which USAC operates and retains \nfinal approval and review of USAC\u2019s proposals.  See \nConsumers\u2019 Rsch., 63 F.4th at 451; Consumers\u2019 Rsch., \n67 F.4th at 796-97; Consumers\u2019 Rsch., 88 F.4th at 927-\n28.  \u201cContributions to [universal service] mechanisms  \n. . .  shall be based on contributors\u2019 projected col-\nlected end-user telecommunications revenues, and on a \ncontribution factor determined quarterly by the [FCC].\u201d  \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.709(a) (emphasis added).  This case dif-\nfers from instances where courts have analyzed whether \n\n103a \n \nan agency was statutorily authorized to rely on a private \nentity for matters that exceeded ministerial tasks.  See \nSierra Club v. Lynn, 502 F.2d 43 (5th Cir. 1974).  As an \ninitial matter, those cases are inapt comparisons be-\ncause USAC serves solely ministerial functions.  And \nthe majority can point to no binding jurisprudence re-\nquiring Congress to specifically designate a private en-\ntity to aid an agency to avoid a constitutional violation. \nPut another way, this court is confronted with a clas-\nsic case where an agency enlists a private entity to assist \nwith ministerial support in the form of fee calculation \nand collection.  See, e.g., Adkins, 310 U.S. at 399 (hold-\ning a private subdelegation of ministerial or fact collect-\ning functions is valid); Oklahoma, 62 F.4th at 229 (\u201cPri-\nvate entities may serve as advisors that propose regula-\ntions.  And they may undertake ministerial functions, \nsuch as fee collection.\u201d  (internal citations omitted)). \nFurthermore, the private entity holds not even a modi-\ncum of final decision-making power.  Regrettably, the \nmajority has adopted Petitioners\u2019 exaggerated concep-\ntion of USAC\u2019s role and discretion to create a private \nnondelegation doctrine violation where none exists.  To \nthe contrary, I would hold, as the panel did, that there \nis no private-nondelegation doctrine violation. \nIII.  EXAMINING REVENUE-RAISING DELEGATIONS \nI conclude with a point of clarification regarding USF \ncontributions in the instant regulatory scheme.  Sec-\ntion 254 establishes a system of fees, not taxes.  It re-\nfers to these sums as contributions\u2014a fee for telecom-\nmunications providers to pay as a cost of doing business.  \nHowever, whether the contributions are a fee has no \nbearing on the nondelegation doctrine analysis because \ndelegations of the taxing power are not subject to \n\n104a \n \nstricter scrutiny.  See Skinner, 490 U.S. at 222.  The \nmajority\u2019s holding presents an unnecessary narrowing \n\u2014or perhaps even elimination\u2014of the distinction of \npass-through fees and taxes and drastically breaks with \nour prior precedent to proclaim that the instant case in-\nvolves a delegation of the power to tax. \na. The Difference Between Pass-Through Fees and \nTaxes \nThe Supreme Court has long differentiated taxes \nfrom fees or other efforts to generate revenue.  See, \ne.g., Twin City Nat\u2019l Bank of New Brighton v. Nebecker, \n167 U.S. 196, 202 (1897); United States v. Munoz-Flores, \n495 U.S. 385, 398 (1990).  In National Cable Television \nAss\u2019n v. United States, 415 U.S. 336, 340-41 (1974), the \nCourt distinguished fees as costs incurred \u201cincident to a \nvoluntary act,\u201d that \u201cbestow[] a benefit on the applicant, \nnot shared by other members of society.\u201d  Id.  Even \nin cases requiring \u201cheightened scrutiny,\u201d we have simi-\nlarly analyzed costs assessed to entities engaged in the \ncourse of business by legislative bodies and divined our \nown analysis for whether costs are fees or taxes.  See \nNeinast v. Texas, 217 F.3d 275, 278 (5th Cir. 2000).  An \nexamination of both the law of this circuit and the \nCourt\u2019s cases addressing this important distinction re-\nveals that the majority\u2019s analysis distinguishing taxes \nand fees invites future line-drawing that will prove to be \nunworkable. \ni.  Analyzing this Distinction under  \nCircuit Precedent \nThe majority errs by misapplying its standard to de-\ntermine what constitutes a tax to the USF contributions \nat issue.  The majority erases the established distinc-\n\n105a \n \ntions between fees, which do not implicate the Taxing \nClause, and taxes.  See Nat\u2019l Cable, 415 U.S. at 340-41.  \nI cannot condone the patent overriding of established \nprecedent from this court and our sister circuits that \nhave long held that USF contributions are fees without \nsubstantial consideration of those determinations. \nIn TOPUC I, we considered a constitutional chal-\nlenge from several wireless telecommunications compa-\nnies asserting that the USF contribution scheme vio-\nlated the Origination Clause.  183 F.3d at 426.  There, \nthe petitioning companies specifically argued that the \nconstitutional violation flowed from the FCC\u2019s require-\nment that paging carriers make contributions to the \nUSF.  Id. at 426-27.  The panel rejected this chal-\nlenge, noting that the Court has made clear that \u201ca stat-\nute [] creat[ing] a particular governmental program and \n[] rais[ing] revenue to support that program  . . .  is \nnot a \u2018Bil[l] for raising Revenue\u2019 within the meaning of \nthe Origination Clause.\u201d  183 F.3d at 426-27 (quoting \nMunoz-Flores, 495 U.S. at 398).  As to the waived Tax \nClause argument, the panel explained in dicta that \n\u201c[e]ven if [the petitioner]\u2019s Taxing Clause argument \nwere properly before us, we find no basis for reversal\u201d \nbecause \u201cthe universal service contribution qualifies as \na fee because it is a payment in support of a service \n(managing and regulating the public telecommunica-\ntions network) that confers special benefits on the [tele-\ncommunications carrier] payees.\u201d  TOPUC I, 183 F.3d \nat 427 n.52 (first citing Nat\u2019l Cable, 415 U.S. at 340; and \nthen citing Rural Tele. Coalition v. FCC, 838 F.2d 1307, \n1314 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (holding universal service contri-\nbutions as a fee supporting allocations between inter-\nstate and intrastate jurisdictions)). \n\n106a \n \nEven though the Taxing Clause and Origination \nClause analyses differ, they require consideration of es-\nsentially the same factors\u2014namely, \u201cwhether the reve-\nnues are used to primarily defray the expenses of regu-\nlating the act\u201d or whether \u201cthe revenues generated from \nthe assessment are for general revenues or for a partic-\nular program.\u201d  Id. at 427 n.51.  Nearly fifteen years \nafter TOPUC I, the D.C. Circuit rejected the same ar-\nguments presented under the Tax Clause in Rural Cel-\nlular Ass\u2019n v. FCC, 685 F.3d 1083, 1089-90 (D.C. Cir. \n2012).  It held that \u00a7 254 could not reasonably be \u201cin-\nterpreted\u201d as \u201can unconstitutional delegation of Con-\ngress\u2019s authority under the Taxing Clause  . . .  be-\ncause the assessment of contributions from carriers is \nnot a tax.\u201d  685 F.3d at 1091.  The en banc court \nshould have reached this same determination here, as \nthis dicta from TOPUC I applies in equal force. \nThe conclusion that USF contributions are valid fees \nand not impermissible taxes follows even under height-\nened scrutiny borrowed from different constitutional \nand statutory frameworks. See discussion infra Part \nII.a-b, pp. 20-23. For instance, in Texas Entertainment \nAss\u2019n, Inc. v. Hegar, 10 F.4th 495 (5th Cir. 2021), we set \nout the governing factors to determine whether an as-\nsessed contribution is a fee or a tax for the purposes of \nthe Tax Injunction Act (\u201cTJA\u201d).  Under the TJA, we \nhave favored a \u201cbroad construction of \u2018tax\u2019\u201d out of re-\nspect of preventing delays in reviewing challenges to \nrevenue raising efforts of state and local governments. \nSee Home Builders Ass\u2019n of Miss. v. City of Madison, \n143 F.3d 1006, 1011 (5th Cir. 1998). Despite the differ-\nences in the analysis presented in the TJA and taxing \npower inquiries, any distinction does not impact the fact \nthat USF contributions are not taxes under either test. \n\n107a \n \nThe Hegar panel stated that a fee:  \u201cis imposed (1) \nby an agency, not the legislature; (2) upon those it reg-\nulates, not the community as a whole; and (3) for the pur-\nposes of defraying regulatory costs, not simply for gen-\neral revenue-raising purposes.\u201d  Id. at 505-06 (quoting \nNeinast, 217 F.3d at 278).  We considered whether the \nTexas legislature\u2019s enactment of a \u201csexually oriented \nbusiness\u201d fee was a fee or a tax.  Id. at 502, 505-06.  \nWe noted that while the cost assessed to each \u201csexually \noriented business\u201d was imposed by the legislature, the \ntext made clear that the cost was imposed only on \u201csex-\nually oriented businesses\u201d to finance a program for the \nprevention of sexual assault in that industry.  Id. at \n506.  Ultimately, we concluded that a charge by a leg-\nislative body is a fee, and not a tax, where the charge is \nlevied against a specific industry sector, serves a regu-\nlatory purpose, and raises funds for a specific regulatory \nprogram.  Id. at 506-07. \nAll of the same factors are present here.  In \u00a7 254, \nCongress set out that a charge must be collected from \n\u201c[e]very telecommunications carrier that provides in-\nterstate telecommunications services.\u201d  47 U.S.C.  \n\u00a7 254(d) (emphasis added).  The contributions collected \nfrom telecommunications carriers are directed to a spe-\ncific fund and \u201cnot general revenue.\u201d  See Hegar, 10 \nF.4th at 506-07.  In fact, \u00a7 254(e) provides that these \nfunds are not universally distributed but paid only to el-\nigible telecommunications carriers that provide univer-\nsal service.  USF contributions are imposed upon a \nspecific industry\u2014telecommunications carriers\u2014and \nnot the general public.  See id.; see also TOPUC I, 183 \nF.3d at 427-28 (holding that all telecommunications  \ncarriers\u2014including those that are exempt from  \ncontributing\u2014are the beneficiaries of the program re-\n\n108a \n \nceiving the primary benefit in the form of the expansion \nof universal service).  The best support for this lies in \nthe plain language of \u00a7 254(b)(4), (d). \nBut one need not rely solely on Congress\u2019s word as \nexpressed in \u00a7 254.  A look at the USF contribution \nsystem in practice confirms who the true payors are.  \nThe class of entities that Congress orders to contribute \n\u2014those that are compelled by congressional act to actu-\nally pay this fee\u2014are the telecommunications providers \nthemselves.  A close review of the list of entities that \nmust contribute, reproduced on USAC\u2019s website, in-\ncludes landline providers, prepaid calling card provid-\ners, coaxial cable providers, telex companies, and other \ntypes of telecommunications service providers.5  Con-\nspicuously absent from \u00a7 254, this list, or from any ma-\nterial or orders of Congress or the FCC is any listing of \nthe American populace as contributors.  Thus, the ma-\njority errs in categorizing the class of contributors as \n\u201cAmerican telecommunications consumers who see USF \ncharges on their phone bills each month.\u201d  Maj. Op. at \n15.  Whether or not the telecommunications carriers \npass through that cost to consumers in the form of a line-\nitem on their bills is irrelevant to our analysis because \nwe are concerned with the constitutionality of Con-\ngress\u2019s action, not the action of independent third par-\nties that choose to pass costs along to their customers.  \nThis degree of separation between the governmental act \nand the consumers\u2019 payments should end the inquiry. \nBut if we continue, it becomes even clearer that there \nis complete overlap between the class of USF contribu-\n \n5  See 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(d); Univ. Serv. Admin. Co., Who Must Con-\ntribute, https://www.usac.org/service-providers/contributing-to-the- \nusf/who-must-contribute/ (last visited May 24, 2024). \n\n109a \n \ntors are the payors and the beneficiaries.  The general \npublic then receives an ancillary benefit in the form of \nmore affordable, standardized service.  However, the \ntelecommunications carriers receive the primary benefit \nin the forms of both direct dispersals of USF money and \npositive network economic effects that result from  \nthe proliferation of universal service.  See 47 U.S.C.  \n\u00a7 254(e); TOPUC I, 183 F.3d at 427-28 & n.52; Rural \nCellular Ass\u2019n, 685 F.3d at 1091-92; see also Mark A. \nLemley & David McGowan, Legal Implications of Net-\nwork Economic Effects, 86 CALIF. L. REV. 479, 551 \n(1998).  As we said in TOPUC I, \u201cuniversal service con-\ntributions are part of a particular program supporting \nthe expansion of, and increased access to, the public in-\nstitutional telecommunications network.  . . .  Each \n[] carrier directly benefits from a larger and larger net-\nwork and, with that in mind, Congress designed the uni-\nversal service scheme to exact payments from those \ncompanies benefiting from the provision of universal \nservice.\u201d  183 F.3d at 427-28 (emphasis added). \nIn Rural Cellular, the D.C. Circuit reached the exact \nsame conclusion regarding enhanced access to broad-\nband services.  685 F.3d at 1091-92.  It held that as \ntelecommunications providers advance universal service \n\u201cthey will benefit from the increased utility of the [basic] \nInternet [and cell services] that come[] with a greater \nnumber of users having enhanced access to\u201d those ser-\nvices.  Id. at 1090-91.  It concluded that the FCC \u201ccol-\nlected these [universal service] contributions to support \nthe expansion of universal service and no other use was \never contemplated.\u201d  Id. at 1091. \nThe majority makes much ado of the benefit that the \ngeneral public and the rural area consumers, schools, \n\n110a \n \nhospitals, and public libraries receive from USF pro-\ngrams.  Maj. Op. at 15 (\u201cThere is no overlap at all be-\ntween the class of USF beneficiaries (recipients of sub-\nsidized telecommunications services) and the class of \nUSF contributors.\u201d).  But, the majority mistakes the \nrecipients of an ancillary benefit derived from the exac-\ntion of a fee with the payor that primarily benefits from \nthe fees exacted for the purposes of funding regulatory \nefforts.  Curiously, the majority cites Trafigura Trad-\ning LLC v. United States, for the proposition that a com-\nmon fee arises \u201cin the context of \u2018value-for-value trans-\naction[s].\u2019\u200a\u201d  29 F.4th 286, 289 (5th Cir. 2022) (quoting \nErik M. Jensen, The Export Clause, 6 FLA. TAX REV. 1, \n8 (2003)). \nIts reliance on Trafigura is misplaced. The majority \nomits that we reviewed that case under the Export \nClause of the Constitution, which requires \u201capply[ing] \n\u2018heightened scrutiny\u2019  . . .  [to] strictly enforce the \nExport\u2019s Clause ban on taxes by \u2018guard[ing] against  \n. . .  the imposition of a [tax] under the pretext of fix-\ning a fee.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at 282 (citation omitted).  Looking at \nthe precedent set forth by this court and our sister cir-\ncuits, it should be apparent that USF contributions are \nfees.  TOPUC I, 183 F.3d at 427-28 & n.52; Rural Cel-\nlular, 685 F.3d at 1091-92.  Nonetheless, some remain \nunmoved to apply our established precedent and ven-\nture into crafting new formulations to analyze whether \na certain charge is a fee or not.  Once again, noting our \nrole not to directly contravene Supreme Court jurispru-\ndence, I would hold that \u00a7 254 does not implicate the tax-\ning power. \n \n\n111a \n \nb. At Every Level of Scrutiny, USF Contributions \nare Fees \nThe majority\u2019s framing of the fee inquiry miscon-\nstrues language from the Court\u2019s decision in National \nCable and numerous persuasive authorities to reach its \nresult.  It describes fees as costs:  (1) \u201cincurred \u2018inci-\ndent to a voluntary act\u2019\u200a\u201d; (2) \u201cimposed by an administra-\ntive agency upon only those persons, or entities, subject \nto its regulation for regulatory purposes\u201d; and (3) reve-\nnues the government raises to supply a benefit that in-\nures to the persons or entities paying them rather than \nto the public generally.  See Maj. Op. at 14. \nUSF contributions have nearly all of these character-\nistics.  First, they are incurred by telecommunications \ncarriers incident to the voluntary act of doing business.  \nIn National Cable, the Court categorized charges in-\ncurred as a result of a request to obtain a state license \nto practice law or medicine, or to run a broadcast sta-\ntion, as fees because they were incident to \u201ca voluntary \nact.\u201d  See 415 U.S. at 340-41.  Thus, telecommunica-\ntions providers\u2019 willing choice to engage in the industry, \nlike the cost paid for professional licensure, fits within \nthe Court\u2019s formulation of costs incurred incident to a \nvoluntary act.  Second, USF contributions are imposed \nby the legislature on telecommunications providers, and \nnot society at large for the purposes of maintaining a \nsystem of universal service that they benefit from.  See \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(d), (e) (imposing the contribution on tel-\necommunications carriers for the benefit of qualified tel-\necommunications carriers).  In this case, the majority \ncan point to nowhere in \u00a7 254 or the Code of Federal \nRegulations where Congress, the FCC, or even USAC \norder or direct telecommunications providers to pass \n\n112a \n \nalong the cost to their customers.  At most, the major-\nity points to a regulation enacted by the FCC that \nmerely notes that is not unlawful for carriers to pass on \nthe costs to consumers.  Maj. Op. at 15 (citing 47 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 54.712(a)).  That simply is not sufficient for \nour constitutional analysis that examines Congress\u2019s ac-\ntion and scrutinizes what it has set out in delegating au-\nthority.  Cf. J.W. Hampton, 276 U.S. at 406 (analyzing \nwhat Congress \u201cmay do in seeking assistance from an-\nother branch\u201d through the delegation of authority). \nThe majority cites Valero Terrestrial Corp. v. Caf-\nfrey, 205 F.3d 130, 134 (4th Cir. 2000), for the proposi-\ntion that the fact that carriers pass along the cost of con-\ntributions to consumers makes it \u201creminiscent of a \u2018clas-\nsic tax\u2019\u200a\u201d with obligations shared by the population at \nlarge.  Maj. Op. at 15.  As mentioned above, this de-\ntermination relies on the baked-in assumption that Con-\ngress or the FCC has imposed the cost on consumers. \nAgain, this simply is not supported by the plain lan-\nguage of the statute.  Section 254(d) specifically pro-\nvides that \u201c[e]very telecommunications carrier that \nprovides interstate telecommunications services\u201d must \nmake contributions.  47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(d).  Costs in-\ncurred by entities and passed down to consumers \nthrough the entities\u2019 independent business judgment \nare not taxes.6 \n \n6  See, e.g., Edye v. Robertson, 112 U.S. 580, 595 (1884) (holding \nthat a per-head charge imposed on ship owners that brought immi-\ngrants to American was a processing fee or mitigation charge, and \nnot a tax); Hugh D. Spitzer, Taxes vs. Fees:  A Curious Confu-\nsion, 38 GONZ. L. REV. 335, 337-50, 364-65 (2002) (detailing differ-\nences between taxes and different types of user charges, commod-\nities charges, and the like). \n\n113a \n \nIn my view, a strained interpretation of our applica-\nble law and liberties taken to broadly expand the defini-\ntion of a tax using distinguishable authorities should not \nstand.  But regardless of the outcome of this analysis, \nthe Court has made clear that whether a revenue-raising \ndelegation implicates the taxing power is irrelevant to a \nnondelegation doctrine challenge.  See Skinner, 490 \nU.S. at 223.  I remain unpersuaded that we should cre-\nate a sharp split with our precedent concluding that \nUSF contributions are fees, along with our sisters cir-\ncuits\u2019 same conclusions.  Nor do I support our depar-\nture from the sound reasoning of the Court that any dis-\ntinction of a charge as a fee or tax is of little relevance \nas it pertains to the nondelegation doctrine analysis. \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nIn sum, \u00a7 254 represents Congress\u2019s effort to \u201cob-\ntain[] the assistance of its coordinate Branches\u201d7 in an \nextensive and vastly changing subject matter area.  In \nso doing, Congress has provided the FCC with an intel-\nligible principle that sufficiently delimits the FCC\u2019s dis-\ncretion based on the established universal service prin-\nciples.  Petitioners\u2019 argument that this revenue-raising \ndelegation is subject to a higher standard of scrutiny has \nbeen consistently rejected by the Supreme Court.  Be-\ncause I am not persuaded that we should deviate from \nSupreme Court precedent, deviate from our precedent, \nand create a split with the Sixth, Eleventh, and D.C. Cir-\ncuits by departing from the solid reasoning offered in \ntheir denials of those nondelegation doctrine challenges, \nI would affirm our original holding that \u00a7 254 satisfies \nthe intelligible principle test and that no constitutional \n \n7  Mistretta, 488 U.S. at 372. \n\n114a \n \nviolation arises from the FCC\u2019s subdelegation of minis-\nterial tasks to USAC. \n \n\n115a \n \nSTEPHEN A. HIGGINSON, Circuit Judge, joined by \nSTEWART, SOUTHWICK, GRAVES, and DOUGLAS, Circuit \nJudges, dissenting: \nThe majority finds neither an unconstitutional dele-\ngation of legislative power nor an unconstitutional exer-\ncise of government power by a private entity.  Su-\npreme Court precedent dictates these answers, which is \nwhy every other circuit to consider these questions \nstopped there and the Supreme Court denied petitions \nfor review of those decisions.  Consumers\u2019 Rsch. v. \nFCC, No. 23-456, 2024 WL 2883753 (U.S. June 10, 2024) \n(Mem.); Consumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, No. 23-743, 2024 WL \n2883755 (U.S. June 10, 2024) (Mem.). \nBut our court does not stop there, going beyond even \npetitioners\u2019 arguments to adopt a novel theory that it is \n\u201cthe combination\u201d of these two non-violations that \u201cvio-\nlates the Legislative Vesting Clause in Article I, \u00a7 1.\u201d  \nMaj. Op. at 55.  That is, according to the majority, \nwhen Congress provides an intelligible principle to \nchannel agency discretion (constitutional) and a private \nentity performs calculations under the agency\u2019s super-\nvision (also constitutional), it becomes\u2014pursuant to an \nundefined, unannounced, and unprecedented test\u2014 \nunconstitutional.  Make no mistake, there is nothing \nnarrow about this ruling.  This decision invites lower \ncourts to leapfrog the Supreme Court; creates a split \nwith all other circuits to have considered the issue; ig-\nnores statutory criteria and regulations; and upends the \npolitical branches\u2019 decades-long engagement with each \nother, industry, and consumers to address the technol-\nogy divide. \n \n \n\n116a \n \nI. \nThe majority argues that the \u201ccombination\u201d theory \non which its holding rests is nothing new.  But the Su-\npreme Court has considered cases that, like this one, in-\nvolved challenges on the grounds that there was both an \nunconstitutional delegation of legislative power and an \nunconstitutional delegation of government power to a \nprivate entity, yet the Court never instructed, as the ma-\njority does now, that a different standard applies.  See, \ne.g., Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U.S. 238, 311 (1936); \nCurrin v. Wallace, 306 U.S. 1, 15-16 (1939); Sunshine \nAnthracite Coal Co. v. Adkins, 310 U.S. 381, 399 (1940). \nIn Sunshine Anthracite, for example, challengers ar-\ngued that there was both an impermissible delegation of \nlegislative power to an executive commission and an im-\npermissible delegation of government power to a private \nentity because that commission relied on private actors. \n310 U.S. at 397-99.  The Supreme Court rejected the \nlegislative delegation challenge after concluding that \u201cin \nthe hands of experts the criteria which Congress ha[d] \nsupplied [we]re wholly adequate for carrying out the \ngeneral policy and purpose of the Act.\u201d  Id. at 398.  It \nthen rejected the private delegation challenge after con-\ncluding that the private actors \u201cfunction subordinately \nto the Commission,\u201d which had \u201cauthority and surveil-\nlance\u201d over them.  Id. at 399.  It ended its analysis of \nboth delegation challenges there.  If the majority were \ncorrect that a different standard applies, the Supreme \nCourt would have instead asked whether, despite consti-\ntuting neither a delegation of legislative power nor a del-\negation of government power to a private entity, there \nwas still a constitutional problem.  It did not.  The \nmajority attempts to distinguish on the ground that the \n\n117a \n \nSupreme Court \u201cfound the Government had not dele-\ngated any legislative power to any private entity\u201d and \n\u201c[t]here cannot be a combined public/private delegation \nwithout a private delegation.\u201d  Maj. Op. at 68.  But \nthat is no answer.  Indeed, it directly undermines the \nmajority\u2019s conclusion because the majority also does not \nfind a private delegation.  Id. at 17 (explaining the \ncourt \u201cneed not definitively answer either delegation \nquestion\u201d). \nThe majority points to presidential removal authority \nprecedent but ignores how the Supreme Court itself has \ncharacterized that precedent.  In Seila Law LLC v. \nCFPB, a decade after Free Enterprise Fund, it ex-\nplained that there were only two exceptions to the pres-\nident\u2019s otherwise \u201cunrestricted removal power.\u201d 591 \nU.S. 197, 204 (2020).  The CFPB\u2019s structure fit into nei-\nther exception.  Id.  The Court declined to create a \nnew one and, unlike the majority here, applied prece-\ndent.  Id.  It was not, as the majority recasts it, a sit-\nuation in which \u201c[t]wo lines of precedent seemed to con-\nverge to suggest the removal restriction at issue posed \nno constitutional problem\u201d but \u201cthe combination\u201d of fea-\ntures was unconstitutional.  Maj. Op. at 56.1  And, as \ndiscussed above, the Supreme Court has considered this \ncombination of features and, applying the legislative \ndelegation and private delegation tests the majority dis-\nregards, has found no constitutional defect. \n \n1  In doing so, the majority quotes Justice Thomas\u2019s separate \nwriting in which he disagreed with seven Justices that severing the \nremoval provision cured the CFPB\u2019s constitutional defect.  But \nthat analysis, joined by only one other Justice, about when sever-\nance is a proper remedy has little purchase here in determining \nwhether there has been a constitutional violation in the first place. \n\n118a \n \nEven if the majority were correct that the presiden-\ntial removal authority cases now suggest that a different \nstandard could apply in this case, the Supreme Court \nhas been clear that, where its precedent \u201chas direct ap-\nplication in a case,\u201d \u201cthe Court of Appeals should follow \nthe case which directly controls, leaving to [it] the pre-\nrogative of overruling its own decisions.\u201d  Agostini v. \nFelton, 521 U.S. 203, 237 (1997) (quoting Rodriguez de \nQuijas v. Shearson/Am. Exp., Inc., 490 U.S. 477, 484 \n(1989)); see also Consumers\u2019 Rsch. v. Consumer Prod. \nSafety Comm\u2019n, 91 F.4th 342, 352 (5th Cir. 2024) (\u201c[O]ur \nrole in the judicial architecture requires us only to map \n\u2014not adjust\u2014the borders\u201d of Supreme Court prece-\ndent).  The majority ignores this repeated instruction. \nII. \nThe majority cannot prevail under legislative delega-\ntion or private delegation precedent, and so it concocts \na theory to rewrite both.  In doing so, it offers no test \nfor determining when something that is neither an un-\nconstitutional delegation of legislative power from Con-\ngress to an agency nor an unconstitutional delegation of \ngovernment power to a private entity becomes unconsti-\ntutional, leaving the political branches powerless to gov-\nern. \nOn the issue of legislative delegation, the majority \nacknowledges that \u201cthe Supreme Court\u2019s nondelegation \n\u2018jurisprudence has been driven by a practical under-\nstanding that in our increasingly complex society, re-\nplete with ever changing and more technical problems, \nCongress simply cannot do its job absent an ability to \ndelegate power under broad general directives.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Maj. \nOp. at 29 (quoting Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. \n361, 372 (1989) (added emphasis omitted)).  It then as-\n\n119a \n \nserts, without explanation, that \u201cCongress did not dele-\ngate because FCC has some superior technical know-\nledge about the optimal amount of universal service \nfunding\u201d as \u201c[n]o such knowledge exists because deter-\nmining the ideal size of a welfare program involves pol-\nicy judgments, not technical ones.\u201d  Id. at 30. \nBut Congress designed a vital, nationwide program \nin an area\u2014telecommunications\u2014where the only con-\nstant has been rapid change in both technology and mar-\nkets.  This is exactly the type of \u201cever changing\u201d and \n\u201ctechnical problem[]\u201d that the Supreme Court has held \nCongress can address with \u201cbroad general directives\u201d to \nexpert agencies.  Mistretta, 488 U.S. at 372.  Congress \nchose not to freeze in place precise rates for different \ntypes of customers in different regions nor to impose \nservice technology standards that would almost imme-\ndiately become obsolete.  Instead, Congress made pol-\nicy decisions about how those precise answers should be \nreached, and regularly revisited, by the expert agency it \nhad created.  To determine which services to fund, \nFCC is required to account for which services \u201care es-\nsential to education, public health, or public safety\u201d; \n\u201csubscribed to by a substantial majority of residential \ncustomers\u201d; \u201cbeing deployed in public telecommunica-\ntions networks by telecommunications carriers\u201d; and \n\u201cconsistent with the public interest, convenience, and \nnecessity.\u201d  47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(c)(1).  Congress provided \nadditional principles to guide FCC.  For example, Con-\ngress made the policy decision that rural Americans \nshould not be abandoned on the wrong side of the tech-\nnology divide.  Without the ability to predict what \ntypes of services urban Americans would have access to \nand what rates they would pay, Congress decided to re-\nquire FCC to ensure that rural Americans have \u201caccess \n\n120a \n \nto telecommunications and information services\u201d \u201crea-\nsonably comparable to those services provided in urban \nareas and that are available at rates that are reasonably \ncomparable to rates charged for similar services in ur-\nban areas.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 254(b)(3).  The majority offers Con-\ngress no guidance on how it should address this rapidly \nevolving area, or any number of others, differently. \nThe majority is mistaken to suggest that these are \nissues that have been withdrawn from congressional \nscrutiny\u2014and attendant public debate\u2014because Con-\ngress has enlisted FCC\u2019s expertise to address them.  \nThere have been congressional hearings, reports, pro-\nposed bills, and engagement with FCC over every as-\npect of the Universal Service Fund (USF), ranging from \nrevising the High Cost Program\u2019s performance goals to \nexpanding the list of eligible entities for the Rural \nHealth Care Program to broadening the contribution \nbase for the USF.

The USF remains subject to extensive con-\ngressional efforts to weigh competing policy priorities \nand interests, balancing concerns of different consum-\ners and industries. \nOn private delegation, too, the majority ignores both \nprecedent and facts.  The Universal Service Adminis-\ntrative Company (USAC), constrained by comprehen-\nsive regulations, \u201cbill[s] contributors, collect[s] contri-\nbutions to the universal service support mechanisms, \nand disburs[es] universal service support funds.\u201d  47 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 54.702(b).  In performing these administra-\ntive functions, USAC \u201cmay not make policy, interpret \n\n121a \n \nunclear provisions of the statute or rules, or interpret \nthe intent of Congress.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 54.702(c). \nYet, the majority asserts that FCC has \u201cde facto if \nnot de jure\u201d abdicated government power to USAC be-\ncause FCC has rarely rejected the contribution factor \nthat USAC calculates based on collected inputs.  Maj. \nOp. at 7.  But the relevant question is what the major-\nity discounts as only the \u201cde jure\u201d one:  Whether FCC \nhas the \u201cauthority\u201d to do so.  Sunshine Anthracite, 310 \nU.S. at 399.  And even the majority acknowledges that \nFCC does have that authority.  See Maj. Op. at 6 \n(\u201cTrue, FCC \u2018reserves the right to set projections of de-\nmand and administrative expenses at amounts that [it] \ndetermines will serve the public interest.\u2019  See 47 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 54.709(a)(3).\u201d).  Certainly, any number of pri-\nvate entities that perform administrative roles at gov-\nernment direction and under government control would \nfail this rewritten test.  See, e.g., What\u2019s a MAC, CTR. \nFOR MEDICARE & MEDICAID SERVS., https://www.cms. \ngov/medicare/coding-billing/medicare-administrative-\ncontractors-macs/whats-mac (last modified Mar. 13, \n2024) \n(describing \nhow \nMedicare \nAdministrative  \nContractors\u2014private insurers\u2014process claims, make \nand account for Medicare payouts, and establish local \ncoverage determinations). \nFurthermore, as Judge Stewart explains, it is hardly \nsurprising that FCC should approve USAC\u2019s calculation \nof the contribution factor when it is entirely the product \nof inputs that FCC regulates at every turn, from the de-\ntailed worksheets that FCC requires telecommunica-\ntions companies submit to calculate projected revenue \nto the caps that FCC imposes on projected expenses.  \nIf anything, it is evidence of the efficacy of FCC\u2019s \u201cper-\n\n122a \n \nvasive surveillance and authority\u201d exercised over USAC.  \nSunshine Anthracite, 310 U.S. at 388.  That authority \nis maintained through processes that allow parties disa-\ngreeing with USAC\u2019s math to seek further FCC review, \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.719(b), and audits to ensure \u201cproper[] ad-\nministrat[ion] [of] the universal service support mecha-\nnisms to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse,\u201d id. \u00a7 54.717.  \nThat those audits reveal errors and waste is concerning \nbut this has never been enough to declare a coequal po-\nlitical branch\u2019s act unconstitutional.  Nor does it con-\nvert USAC\u2019s accounting role into a constitutional viola-\ntion.2 \nAdditionally, the majority overlooks the fact that the \nincreasing contribution factor is not caused by the scope \nof USAC\u2019s authority but is instead driven \u201cin large part \n[by] a decline in the contributions revenue base, i.e., pro-\nviders are reporting a declining share of telecommuni-\ncations revenues and an increasing share of non-tele-\ncommunications revenues.\u201d  FUTURE OF THE UNIVER-\nSAL SERVICE FUND at 9.  Crucially, Congress has re-\nsponded with a number of legislative proposals, from \nmembers of both parties, to potentially expand the rev-\nenue base by including broadband providers and online \ncontent and services providers.  Id. at 9-10 (citing Sen-\nator Markwayne Mullin\u2019s Lowering Broadband Costs \n \n2  The majority separately argues that Congress was required to \nexpressly authorize USAC\u2019s role under founding-era agency law \nprinciples.  But, even granting that this were historically accurate \nand the relevant question, the majority acknowledges that there \nwas an \u201cassum[ption] that ministerial tasks could be subdelegated,\u201d \nand so this argument fails because, as discussed above, USAC per-\nforms only ministerial tasks.  Maj. Op. at 49 (citing GARY LAWSON \n& GUY SEIDMAN, \u201cA GREAT POWER OF ATTORNEY\u201d:  UNDERSTAND-\nING THE FIDUCIARY CONSTITUTION 115 (2017)). \n\n123a \n \nfor Consumers Act, Senator Roger Wicker\u2019s FAIR Con-\ntributions Act, and the Reforming Broadband Connec-\ntivity Act proposed by Senator Amy Klobuchar and Rep-\nresentative Joe Neguse).  Put differently, the body \nconstitutionally tasked with addressing the policy prob-\nlem the majority identifies is doing just that. \nAs our unanimous panel and every other court to \nhave considered these issues held, each challenge fails \nunder binding Supreme Court legislative delegation and \nprivate delegation precedent.  Yet the majority, in un-\ndermining both lines of precedent, offers no test for de-\ntermining at what point something that is neither an un-\nconstitutional delegation of legislative power nor an un-\nconstitutional delegation of government power to a pri-\nvate entity still becomes, convergingly, unconstitutional. \nCongress, the Executive, and courts in our circuit are \nleft only with the implication that the bar for what is an \nintelligible principle is raised\u2014by how much is unclear \n\u2014when an agency enlists a private entity to perform ac-\ncounting tasks.  Conversely, tasks performed by pri-\nvate entities that have long been considered ministerial \nwill be elevated\u2014at what point, again, is unclear\u2014to ex-\nercises of government power when Congress legislates \nwith otherwise permissibly intelligible principles that \nlimit agency discretion. \nThis convergence sleight of hand not only undoes Su-\npreme Court precedent but also leaves the political \nbranches powerless to address this perceived constitu-\ntional deficiency, ignorant as to how to legislate and reg-\nulate in ways that will survive judicial review.

STEWART, Circuit Judge: \nConsumers\u2019 Research, along with other entities, (col-\nlectively \u201cPetitioners\u201d) challenge:  (1) the constitution-\nality of Congress\u2019s delegation of administration of the \nUniversal Service Fund (the \u201cUSF\u201d) to the Federal Com-\nmunications Commission (the \u201cFCC\u201d); and (2) the FCC\u2019s \nsubsequent reliance on a private entity for ministerial \n\n126a \n \nsupport.  Because there are no nondelegation doctrine \nviolations, we DENY their petition. \nI.  BACKGROUND \nCongress enacted \u00a7 254 of the Telecommunications \nAct of 1996, which established the USF and entrusted \nits administration to the FCC.  Congress passed \u00a7 254 \nto ensure the facilitation of broad access to telecommu-\nnications services across the country.  The USF ac-\ncomplishes this goal by raising funds which are later dis-\ntributed to people, entities, and projects to expand and \nadvance telecommunications services in the nation.  \nFunds are raised by periodic contributions to the USF \nfrom telecommunications carriers, who later pass those \ncosts on to consumers via line-item charges in their \nmonthly bills. \nThe FCC relies on a private entity, the Universal \nService Administrative Company (\u201cUSAC\u201d), to aid it in \nits administration of the USF.  USAC is comprised of \nindustry experts and the FCC tasks it with certain min-\nisterial responsibilities, including:  (1) collecting self-\nreported income information from telecommunications \ncarriers; (2) compiling data to formulate the potential \ncontribution rate for the USF; and (3) proposing a quar-\nterly budget to the FCC for the USF\u2019s continued preser-\nvation.  USAC proposals are approved by the FCC ei-\nther expressly or after fourteen days of agency inaction. \nUSAC submitted its 2022 first quarter projections to \nthe FCC on November 2, 2021.  The FCC published \nthese projections for notice-and-comment in accordance \nwith the Administrative Procedure Act.  On November \n19, 2021, Petitioners submitted comments challenging \nthe constitutionality of the USF and the FCC\u2019s reliance \non USAC.  The FCC weighed the comments and issued \n\n127a \n \na Public Notice of Proposed First Quarter 2022 Univer-\nsal Service Contribution Factor (\u201cthe Proposal\u201d).  Pe-\ntitioners filed another comment, invoking the same ar-\nguments as their November comment and seeking the \ndiscontinuance of the USF.  The FCC, nonetheless, ap-\nproved USAC\u2019s proposal on December 27, 2021.  In re-\nsponse, Petitioners filed this petition on January 5, 2022. \nOn appeal, Petitioners assert that:  (1) the Hobbs \nAct is not a jurisdictional bar to their constitutional \nclaims; (2) Section 254 violates the nondelegation doc-\ntrine because Congress failed to supply the FCC with an \nintelligible principle; and (3) the FCC\u2019s relationship with \nUSAC violates the private nondelegation doctrine be-\ncause the FCC does not adequately subordinate USAC \nin its administration of the USF. \nII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW \nThis court reviews constitutional issues stemming \nfrom an agency\u2019s action de novo.  See Huwaei Tech \nUSA, Inc. v. FCC, 2 F.4th 421, 434 (5th Cir. 2021).  We \n\u201chold unlawful and set aside\u201d any agency action that is \n\u201ccontrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or im-\nmunity.\u201d  Id. (citing 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(B)). \nIII.  DISCUSSION \nA.  Jurisdiction \nThe Hobbs Act \u201cprovides that a party aggrieved by a \nrule, regulation, or final order  . . .  must file a peti-\ntion for judicial review within sixty days.\u201d  State of Tex. \nv. United States, 749 F.2d 1144, 1146 (5th Cir. 1985).  \nThis sixty-day period \u201cis jurisdictional and cannot be ju-\ndicially altered or expanded.\u201d  City of Arlington v. \nFCC, 668 F.3d 229, 237 (5th Cir. 2012).  However, \nplaintiffs may \u201cchallenge  . . .  a regulation after the \n\n128a \n \nlimitations period has expired if the claim is that the \nagency has exceeded its constitutional authority or stat-\nutory authority.\u201d  State v. Rettig, 987 F.3d 518, 529 (5th \nCir. 2021).  \u201cTo sustain such a challenge, the claimant \nmust show some direct, final agency action involving the \nparticular plaintiff within [sixty days] of filing suit.\u201d  \nId. (quoting Dunn-McCampbell Royalty Int., Inc. v. \nNat\u2019l Park Serv., 112 F.3d 1283, 1287 (5th Cir. 1997)).  \nAn agency\u2019s action is direct and final when two criteria \nare satisfied:  First, the action must mark the \u201ccon-\nsummation of the agency\u2019s decisionmaking process  \n. . .  [and] second, the action must be one by which \nrights or obligations have been determined, or from \nwhich legal consequences will flow.\u201d  Dunn-McCampbell, \n112 F.3d at 1287 (internal quotation and citation omit-\nted). \nThe FCC contends that Petitioners\u2019 claims are time-\nbarred by the Hobbs Act because:  (1) any challenge to \n\u00a7 254 should have come when Congress originally en-\nacted it and (2) the Proposal is not a direct and final \nagency action which creates legal consequences or new \nobligations for Petitioners.  The FCC relies on Dunn-\nMcCampbell, where we foreclosed a facial challenge to \na National Park Service regulation because \u201cthe limita-\ntions period beg[an] to run when the agency publishe[d] \nthe regulation in the Federal Register.\u201d  Id.  But we \nalso carved out a limited exception in that case when we \nrecognized that \u201can agency\u2019s application of a rule to a \nparty creates a new  . . .  cause of action to the \nagency\u2019s constitutional or statutory authority.\u201d  Id.  \nPetitioners assert that they qualify for this exception.  \nWhether they are correct depends on our determination \nthat the Proposal:  (1) constitutes application of a direct \nand final rule by the FCC; and (2) determines Petition-\n\n129a \n \ners\u2019 rights or has legal consequences for non-compliance.  \nWe hold in Petitioners\u2019 favor on both prongs.   \nHere, the Proposal qualifies for the Dunn-McCamp-\nbell exception because it (1) is a direct and final order \nwhich consummates the FCC\u2019s decisionmaking process; \nand (2) punishes telecommunications carriers for non-\ncompliance.  See 112 F.3d at 1287.  Regarding prong \none, the Proposal is distinguishable from the regulation \nin Dunn-McCampbell.  In that case, we held that \nDunn-McCampbell\u2019s facial challenge was time barred \nbecause the \u201cPark Service ha[d] not yet applied the reg-\nulations to the companies.\u201d  Id. at 1288-89.  So, any \nchallenge he brought before the Park Service ever ap-\nplied the regulation was necessarily a challenge to the \nregulation itself.  The reverse is true in the instant \ncase, where the FCC has applied and reapplied \u00a7 254\u2019s \nmandatory USF Contributions through its approval of \nthe quarterly proposals.  Each approval consummates \nthe FCC\u2019s decisionmaking process for that quarter and, \nthus, allows for a constitutional challenge if that chal-\nlenge is brought within the sixty-day time limit. \nProng two is also satisfied because the Proposal un-\ndoubtedly has legal consequences which flow to carriers \nthat fail to meet their contribution obligations.  See 47 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 54.713(b) (providing that \u201cdelinquent\u201d USF \ncontributors are subject to \u201cinterest at the rate equal to \nthe U.S. prime rate  . . .  plus 3.5 percent, as well as \nadministrative charges of collection and/or penalties and \ncharges permitted by the applicable law\u201d).  Because \nPetitioners satisfy both Dunn-McCampbell prongs, the \nHobbs Act does not bar their constitutional claims and \nwe proceed to the merits of their nondelegation argu-\nments.  112 F.3d at 1287; Rettig, 987 F.3d at 529. \n\n130a \n \nB.  Nondelegation \nArticle I of the United States Constitution provides \nthat \u201c[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted shall be \nvested in a Congress of the United States.\u201d  \u201cAccompa-\nnying that assignment of power  . . .  is a bar on its \nfurther delegation.\u201d  Gundy v. United States, 139  \nS. Ct. 2116, 2123 (2019) (internal quotations and citation \nomitted).  However, the Constitution does not deny \nCongress the necessary \u201cflexibility and practicality\u201d to \nperform its functions.  Id.  The Supreme Court has, \ntherefore, recognized that \u201cCongress may obtain the as-\nsistance of its coordinate Branches  . . .  and in par-\nticular, may confer substantial discretion on executive \nagencies to implement and enforce the laws.\u201d  Id.  \n(quoting Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 372 \n(1989)). \nTo that end, the Constitution only requires Congress \nto provide an intelligible principle which adequately \nguides the Executive agency.  See id. (holding \u201cthat a \nstatutory delegation is constitutional as long as Con-\ngress lays down by legislative act an intelligible princi-\nple to which the person or body authorized to exercise \nthe delegated authority is directed to conform\u201d) (inter-\nnal quotations and citation omitted). \nThe intelligible principle standard is \u201cnot demand-\ning.\u201d  Id. at 2129.  The Supreme Court has rarely \n\u201csecond-guess[ed] Congress regarding the permissible \ndegree of policy judgment that can be left to those exe-\ncuting or applying the law.\u201d  Id.  Ultimately, \u201ca non-\ndelegation inquiry always begins (and often almost \nends) with statutory interpretation.  The constitutional \nquestion is whether Congress has supplied an intelligi-\nble principle to guide the delegee\u2019s use of discretion.\u201d  \n\n131a \n \nId.  Put differently, we must construe \u00a7 254 to discern \nwhat tasks it delegates and what instructions Congress \nprovided therein.  \u201cOnly after [we have] determined  \n[\u00a7 254\u2019s] meaning can [we] decide whether the law suffi-\nciently guides executive discretion to accord with Article \nI.\u201d  Id \nWe recently grappled with the intelligible principle \nstandard in Jarkesy v. SEC, 34 F.4th 446 (5th Cir. 2022).1  \nIn that case, we held that Congress failed to provide an \nintelligible principle when it gave \u201cthe SEC the ability \nto determine which subjects of its enforcement actions \nare entitled to Article III proceedings with a jury trial, \nand which are not.\u201d  Id. at 461.  We acknowledged that \nthe Supreme Court \u201chas not in the past several decades \nheld that Congress failed to provide a requisite intelligi-\nble principle.\u201d  Id. at 462.  But we also noted that the \nCourt had not been presented an instance where \u201cCon-\ngress offered no guidance whatsoever\u201d to an executive \nagency in that same span of time.  Id.  (emphasis in orig-\ninal).  Accordingly, we reasoned that \u201c[i]f the intelligi-\nble principle standard means anything, it must mean \nthat a total absence of guidance is impermissible under \nthe Constitution.\u201d  Id. \nIn Jarkesy, we stated that the nondelegation doc-\ntrine applies where Congress has provided \u201cno guid-\nance whatsoever\u201d to an agency, Id. at 462 (emphasis in \noriginal), citing to the most recent (though long ago)  \nSupreme Court nondelegation violation decision.  See \n \n1  We have since denied petition to rehear this case before the en \nbanc court.  See Jarkesy v. SEC, 51 F.4th 644.  On March 8, 2023, \nthe Government filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the Su-\npreme Court.  Jarkesy\u2019s response to that petition is due April 10, \n2023. \n\n132a \n \nPanama Refining Co. v. Ryan, 293 U.S. 388, 405 (1935) \n(holding that there was a nondelegation violation when \nCongress gave the President broad authority to prohibit \nthe transportation of oil-related products in interstate \ncommerce, but failed to provide any policy, establish any \nstandard, or lay down any rules to direct the President\u2019s \nexercise of this authority). \nHaving fleshed out what the intelligible principle \nstandard requires, we now examine Petitioners\u2019 asser-\ntions that \u00a7 254 violates the nondelegation doctrine be-\ncause:  (1) Congress failed to provide the FCC with an \nintelligible principle; and (2) to the extent Congress pro-\nvided intelligible principles, they are merely aspira-\ntional and place no objective limits on the FCC in its ad-\nministration of the USF. \n1.  Whether Congress Provided Intelligible  \nPrinciples in \u00a7 254 \nPetitioners argue that Congress has unconstitution-\nally delegated its authority to the FCC without provid-\ning an intelligible principle.  For example, they point to \nthe absence of a limit on how much the FCC can raise \nfor the USF as evidence of a lack of proper guidance.  \nWith no objective ceiling on the amount that the FCC \ncan raise each quarter, they contend that Congress\u2019s al-\nleged intelligible principles fail to place necessary limits \non the FCC\u2019s ability to assess fees from telecommunica-\ntions carriers.  Also, Petitioners aver that \u00a7 254(b)(1)-(7) \ncontains mere public policy statements which impose no \nmeaningful limitations on or guidance to the FCC\u2019s  \nrevenue-raising obligation in its administration of the \nUSF.  In sum, Petitioners maintain that Congress has \nnot articulated any guidance to the FCC in its admin-\n\n133a \n \nistration of the USF\u2014and that this failure violates the \nnondelegation doctrine.  We disagree. \nCongress passed \u00a7 254 for the express purpose of \npreserving and advancing universal telecommunications \nservices.2  See 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(b).  To that end, \u00a7 254(b) \nprovides that the FCC \u201cshall base policies\u201d on certain \nenumerated principles.3  Petitioners maintain that these \nprinciples offer no guidance to the FCC as it attempts \nto realize \u00a7 254(b)\u2019s purpose.  Their position is untena-\nble.  Section 254 expressly requires the FCC to ensure \nthat telecommunications services are:  (1) of decent \nquality and reasonably priced; (2) equally available in \nrural and urban areas; (3) supported by state and fed-\neral mechanisms; (4) funded in an equitable and nondis-\ncriminatory manner; (5) established in important public \nspaces (schools, healthcare providers, and libraries); \nand (6) available broadly across all regions in the nation.  \nSee \u00a7 254(b)(1)-(7).  And should the FCC ever conclude \nthat these principles were insufficient, the statute ena-\nbles, and likely obligates, it to add principles \u201cconsistent \nwith\u201d \u00a7 254\u2019s overall purpose.  See \u00a7 254(b)(7).  Rather \nthan leave the FCC with \u201cno guidance whatsoever,\u201d \nCongress provided ample direction for the FCC in \u00a7 254.  \nJarkesy, 34 F.4th at 462. \n \n \n \n2  See also 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 (noting the FCC\u2019s original purpose of \ncreating policies designed \u201cto make available, so far as possible, to \nall the people of the United States  . . .  a rapid, efficient, Na-\ntion-wide  . . .  wire and radio communication service with ade-\nquate facilities at reasonable charges\u201d). \n3  See 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(b)(1)-(7) (providing a full list of principles). \n\n134a \n \nUltimately, in enacting \u00a7 254, Congress chose to \n\u201cconfer substantial discretion\u201d over administration of \nthe USF to the FCC.  Gundy, 139 S. Ct. at 2139.  Peti-\ntioners take issue with how the FCC uses this discre-\ntion\u2014arguing that the FCC operates the USF with no \nguidance from Congress.4  But if the FCC had a ques-\ntion about how to manage the USF, it need only look to \n\u00a7 254 to find an answer.  Therefore, we conclude that \nCongress supplied the FCC with intelligible principles \nwhen it tasked the agency with overseeing the USF.  \nHaving established that \u00a7 254 contains intelligible prin-\nciples, we next consider whether those principles ade-\nquately limit the FCC\u2019s revenue raising function. \n2.  Whether \u00a7 254 Properly Limits the FCC \nPetitioners contend that even if Congress provided \nthe FCC with intelligible principles we should rule in \n \n4  We note that much of Petitioners\u2019 nondelegation argument re-\nlies primarily on the dissents of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in \nGundy and this court\u2019s in Rettig, which, of course, are not binding \non our court.  See, e.g., Gundy, 139 S. Ct. at 2133, 2134, 2135-37 (Gor-\nsuch, J., joined by Roberts, C.J., and Thomas, J. dissenting); see \nalso Rettig, 993 F.3d at 408, 409-10 (5th Cir. 2021) (Ho, J. joined by \nJones, Smith, Elrod, and Duncan, JJ., dissenting from denial of re-\nhearing en banc).  That some Justices of the Supreme Court and \nsome judges of this circuit have opined on whether Congress is per-\nmitted to delegate \u201cdifficult policy choices\u201d is not determinative \nthat Congress impermissibly did so here when it delegated admin-\nistration of the USF to the FCC.  Moreover, the mere fact that \nPetitioners dispute the policy choices that the FCC has made in \noverseeing the USF does not translate to a constitutional or statu-\ntory violation.  See Gundy, 139 S. Ct. at 2139 (\u201cCongress may con-\nfer substantial discretion on executive agencies to implement and \nenforce the laws.\u201d).  At best, Petitioners argue for different policy \nchoices.  But they provide no binding law to support such a re-\nquest. \n\n135a \n \ntheir favor because those principles are nothing more \nthan \u201cvague aspirations\u201d that fail to set objective limits \non the FCC as they operate the USF.  Gundy, 139  \nS. Ct. at 2133.  They argue that \u00a7 254 is no different than \nthe statute in Panama Refining.5  In that case, the Su-\npreme Court took issue with 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 701\u2019s generally \nunhelpful guidance to the President as he tried to regu-\nlate the interstate hot oil industry.  See Panama Re-\nfining, 293 U.S. at 419 (observing that \u00a7 701 failed to \n\u201climit[] or control[] the authority conferred\u201d to the Pres-\nident).  Petitioners argue that \u00a7 254 similarly fails to \nlimit or control the FCC\u2019s ability to raise revenue for the \nUSF.  We disagree. \nHere, \u00a7 254 provides limitations on the FCC\u2019s  \nrevenue-raising ability, whereas the statute in Panama \nRefining is markedly different.  In Panama Refining, \nthe Supreme Court observed that: \nThe Congress left the matter to the President with-\nout standard or rule, to be dealt with as he pleased.  \nThe effort by ingenious and diligent construction to \nsupply a criterion still permits such a breadth of au-\nthorized action as essentially to commit to the Presi-\ndent the functions of a Legislature rather than those \n \n5  See 293 U.S. at 417 (stating that the purpose of the challenges \nstatute was \u201cto eliminate unfair competitive practices, to promote \nthe fullest possible utilization of the present productive capacity of \nindustries, to avoid undue restriction of production (except as may \nbe temporarily required), to increase the consumption of industrial \nand agricultural products by increasing purchasing power, to re-\nduce and relieve unemployment, to improve standards of labor, and \notherwise to rehabilitate industry and to conserve natural re-\nsources.\u201d) (internal quotations omitted). \n\n136a \n \nof an executive or administrative officer executing a \ndeclared legislative policy. \n293 U.S. at 418-19 (emphasis added).  Section 254 con-\ntains no such deficiencies, and certainly did not leave the \nmatter to the FCC \u201cwithout standard or rule, to be dealt \nwith as [it] pleased.\u201d  Id.  Instead, \u00a7 254 requires that \nthe FCC only raise enough revenue to satisfy its pri-\nmary function.  See \u00a7 254(b). \nFor example, \u00a7 254(c)(1)(A)-(D) limits distribution of \nUSF funds to telecommunications services that:  (1) \n\u201care essential to education, public health, or public safety;\u201d \n(2) \u201care being deployed in public telecommunications \nnetworks by telecommunications carriers;\u201d and (3) \u201care \nconsistent with the public interest, convenience, and ne-\ncessity.\u201d  Likewise, \u00a7 254(b)(5) requires that the FCC \nensure there are \u201cspecific, predictable and sufficient \nFederal and State mechanisms to preserve and advance \nuniversal service.\u201d  Furthermore, \u00a7 254(e) limits distri-\nbution of USF funds to eligible communication carriers \nunder \u00a7 214(e)\u2014and even those carriers may only re-\nceive support \u201csufficient to achieve the purposes of\u200a\u201d  \n\u00a7 254.  Taken together, these provisions demonstrate \nthat the FCC is not in the dark as to the amount of fund-\ning it should seek each quarter.  Instead, \u00a7 254 sets out \nthe FCC\u2019s obligations with respect to administration of \nthe USF and the FCC, in turn, calculates what funds are \nnecessary to satisfy its obligations. \nUltimately, \u00a7 254 reflects Congress\u2019s understanding \nthat telecommunications services are constantly evolv-\ning.6  That understanding also drove Congress to im-\n \n6  See, e.g., \u00a7 254(c)(1) (providing that \u201c[u]niversal service is an \nevolving level of telecommunications services that the Commission \n \n\n137a \n \nplement a unique revenue raising mechanism for the \nUSF.  That the mechanism is unique is not in itself a \nnondelegation violation\u2014especially where Congress has \nplaced identifiable limits on what USF distributions can \nfund.  See, e.g., \u00a7 254(b)-(e).  Congress failed to place \nthese limitations on the President in Panama Refining \n\u2014and that led the Supreme Court to hold that a non-\ndelegation violation occurred.  But Congress did not \nmake that same mistake with \u00a7 254, instead, ensuring \nthat the statute is replete with intelligible principles to \nguide the FCC.  Because Congress provided the FCC \nwith numerous intelligible principles for its administra-\ntion of the USF and those principles sufficiently limit \nthe FCC\u2019s revenue-raising activity, we hold that \u00a7 254 \ndoes not violate the nondelegation doctrine. \nC.  Private Nondelegation \nThe private nondelegation doctrine prevents \u201cgov-\nernments from delegating too much power to private \npersons and entities.\u201d  Boerschig, 872 F.3d at 707.  \n\u201cAlthough this so-called private nondelegation doctrine \nhas been largely dormant\u201d for nearly a century, \u201cits con-\ntinuing force is generally accepted.\u201d  Id.; see also Nat\u2019l \nHorsemen\u2019s Benevolent & Protective Ass\u2019n v. Black, 53 \nF.4th 869, 880-82 (5th Cir. 2022) (discussing the evolu-\ntion of the private nondelegation doctrine).  Function-\nally, the doctrine prevents agencies from giving private \nparties the \u201cunrestrained ability to decide whether an-\nother citizen\u2019s property rights can be restricted\u201d be-\n \nshall establish periodically under this section, taking into account \nadvances in telecommunications and information technologies and \nservices\u201d). \n\n138a \n \ncause \u201cany resulting deprivation happens without \u2018pro-\ncess of law.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Boerschig, 872 F.3d at 708. \nTo be clear, agencies \u201cmay subdelegate to private en-\ntities so long as the entities \u2018function subordinately to\u2019 \nthe federal agency and the federal agency \u2018has authority \nand surveillance over [their] activities.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Rettig, 987 \nF.3d at 532 (quoting Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v. \nAdkins, 310 U.S. 381, 399 (1940)).  Ultimately, a statute \ndoes not violate the private nondelegation doctrine if it \n\u201c\u200a\u2018imposes a standard to guide\u2019 the private party and (2) \nprovides \u2018review of that determination that prevents the \n[private party] from having the final say.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. (altera-\ntion in original) (quoting Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 \nU.S. 238, 310-311 (1936)). \nOur decision in National Horsemen provides a timely \ncomparator to the instant case.  53 F.4th 869 (5th Cir. \n2022).  There, multiple organizations sued the Federal \nTrade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d), alleging that the Horserac-\ning Integrity and Safety Act\u2019s (\u201cHISA\u201d) regulatory \nscheme violated the private nondelegation doctrine by \ngiving government power to the Horseracing Integrity \nand Safety Authority (the \u201cAuthority\u201d) without adequate \nagency supervision.  Id.  On appeal, we held that the \nFTC\u2019s relationship with the Authority violated the pri-\nvate nondelegation doctrine. \nWe first noted that, under HISA, the Authority had \n\u201csweeping rulemaking power,\u201d with the ability to estab-\nlish, enforce, and punish all entities involved in the \nhorseracing industry.  Id. at 882.  We also observed \nthat \u201cHISA\u2019s generous grant of authority to the Author-\nity to craft entire industry programs strongly suggests \nit is the Authority, not the FTC, that is in the saddle.\u201d  \nId. at 883 (internal quotations omitted).  Finally, we \n\n139a \n \nhighlighted that the FTC had no authority to conduct \nindependent review of the Authority\u2019s policy choices and \ndid not possess final say on what rules the Authority \npromulgated.  See id. at 884.  Instead, the FTC could \nonly \u201crecommend changes to the Authority\u2019s rules (and \nthen, only to the extent that the rules are inconsistent \nwith HISA).\u201d  Id. at 888.  After considering the lack \nof oversight and control the FTC exercised over the Au-\nthority, we ruled against the FTC and held its redelega-\ntion of Congressional power unconstitutional. \nIn this case, Petitioners argue that the FCC violated \nthe private nondelegation doctrine when it redelegated \nits authority over the USF to USAC, a private entity.  \nThey aver that the FCC does not oversee USAC in its \nperformance of its duties.  For example, they highlight \nthat the FCC rarely exercises its power to alter USAC\u2019s \nproposed contribution factor under \u00a7 54.709(a)(3).  They \nassert that one reason that the FCC does not exercise \nthis authority is because the statute affords the agency \njust fourteen days to review and alter any USAC deter-\nminations before they become binding on the telecom-\nmunications carriers.  To Petitioners, such a small win-\ndow for review renders the FCC\u2019s oversight over USAC \nmeaningless.  They suggest that the FCC is a rubber \nstamp for USAC\u2019s proposals and that USAC effectively \nadministers the USF.  We disagree. \nHere, the FCC has not violated the private nondele-\ngation doctrine because it wholly subordinates USAC.  \nFirst, federal statutory law expressly subordinates \nUSAC to the FCC.  See 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.702(b) (provid-\ning that USAC \u201cmay not make policy, interpret unclear \nprovisions of the statute or rules, or interpret the intent \nof Congress\u201d).  Second, unlike in National Horsemen, \n\n140a \n \nUSAC does not enjoy the same type of sweeping rule-\nmaking power\u2014instead it makes a series of proposals to \nthe FCC based off expert analysis, which are not bind-\ning on carriers until the FCC approves them.  See 47 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 54.709(a).  Third, the FCC permits telecom-\nmunications carriers to challenge USAC proposals di-\nrectly to the agency and often grants relief to those chal-\nlenges.7  Fourth, the FCC dictates how USAC calcu-\nlates the USF contribution factor and subsequently re-\nviews the calculation method after USAC makes a pro-\nposal.  See 47 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 54.709(a)(2)-(3); 54.711(a). \nUltimately, the FCC only uses USAC\u2019s proposals af-\nter independent consideration of the collected data and \nother relevant information.  We have expressly upheld \nthese types of arrangements.  See Rettig, 987 F.3d at \n531 (noting that agencies are permitted to \u201creasonably \ncondition\u201d their actions \u201con an outside party\u2019s determi-\nnation of some issue\u201d).  Because the FCC properly sub-\nordinates USAC, it has not violated the private nondele-\ngation doctrine. \nIV.

The proposed circularity discount \nfactor is calculated in a spreadsheet program, which means that \ninternal calculations are made with more than 15 decimal places. \n11 See 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.709(a)(3). \n\n147a \n \nuse the contribution factor to calculate universal service \ncontributions for the first quarter of 2022.  USAC will \nreduce each provider\u2019s contribution obligation by a cir-\ncularity discount approximating the provider\u2019s contribu-\ntions in the upcoming quarter.12  USAC includes con-\ntribution obligations less the circularity discount in in-\nvoices sent to contributors.  Contribution payments \nare due on the dates shown on the invoice.  Contribu-\ntors will pay interest for each day for which the pay-\nments are late.  Contributors failing to pay contribu-\ntions in a timely fashion may be subject to the enforce-\nment provisions of the Communications Act of 1934, as \namended, and any other applicable law.  In addition, \ncontributors may be billed by USAC for reasonable \ncosts of collecting overdue contributions.13 \nWe also emphasize that carriers may not mark up \nfederal universal service line-item amounts above the \ncontribution factor.14  Thus, carriers may not, during \nthe first quarter of 2022, recover through a federal uni-\nversal service line item an amount that exceeds 25.2 per-\ncent of the interstate telecommunications charges on a \ncustomer\u2019s bill. \nIn addition, under the limited international revenues \nexception (LIRE) in section 54.706(c) of the Commis-\nsion\u2019s rules, a contributor to the universal service fund \nwhose projected collected interstate end-user telecom-\nmunications revenues comprise less than 12 percent of \nits combined projected collected interstate and interna-\n \n12 USAC will calculate each individual contributor\u2019s contribution \nin the following manner:  (1-Circulatory Factor) * (Contribution \nFactor*Revenue) \n13 See 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.713. \n14 See 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.712. \n\n148a \n \ntional end-user telecommunications revenues shall con-\ntribute based only on projected collected interstate end-\nuser telecommunications revenues, net of projected con-\ntributions.15  The rule is intended to exclude from the \ncontribution base the international end-user telecom-\nmunications revenues of any entity whose annual contri-\nbution, based on the provider\u2019s interstate and interna-\ntional end-user telecommunications revenues, would ex-\nceed the amount of its interstate end-user revenues.16  \nThe proposed contribution factor exceeds 12 percent, \nwhich we recognize could result in a contributor being \nrequired to contribute to the universal service fund an \namount that exceeds its interstate end-user telecommu-\nnications revenue.  Should a contributor face this situ-\nation, the contributor may petition the Commission for \nwaiver of the LIRE threshold.17 \n \n15 See 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.706. \n16 See Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service, Sixteenth \nOrder on Reconsideration, CC Docket No. 96-45, Eighth Report \nand Order, CC Docket No. 96-45, Sixth Report and Order, Docket \nNo. 96-262, 15 FCC Rcd 1679, 1687-1692, paras. 17-29 (1999) (Fifth \nCircuit Remand Order). \n17 Generally, the Commission\u2019s rules may be waived for good \ncause shown.  47 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.3.  The Commission may exercise its \ndiscretion to waive a rule where the particular facts make strict \ncompliance inconsistent with the public interest.  Northeast Cel-\nlular Telephone Co. v. FCC, 897 F.2d 1164, 1166 (D.C. Cir. 1990) \n(Northeast Cellular).  In addition, the Commission may consider \nconsiderations of hardship, equity, or more effective implementa-\ntion of overall policy on an individual basis.  WAIT Radio v.

Bur. 2003) (\u201cAlthough \nthe Second Order on Reconsideration has not yet been published \nin the Federal Register and accordingly has not yet become effec-\ntive, we expect it will be published before the start of the second \nquarter of 2003.  Absent release of this Public Notice, the six-digit \ncontribution factor announced on March 7, 2003 would be deemed \napproved by the Commission on March 21, 2003.  However, the \nsix-digit contribution factor would be inconsistent with the Second \nOrder on Reconsideration.  Therefore, the Bureau takes this lim-\nited action today to ensure the implementation of the Second Order \non Reconsideration for the second quarter of 2003.\u201d). \n\n155a \n \ncount for contribution factor rounding when calculating \nthe \u201ccircularity\u201d discount factor.6 \nOn June 23, 2006, the Commission issued an order re-\naligning oversight responsibilities within the FCC for \nthe USF, the universal service support mechanisms and \nUSAC.7  Pursuant to that order, the FCC\u2019s Office of \nthe Managing Director is now responsible for calculat-\ning the quarterly contribution factor and issuing related \npublic notices.8  \nConsistent with Commission regulations and orders, \non November 2, 2021, USAC filed the Federal Universal \nService Support Mechanisms Fund Size and Adminis-\ntrative Cost Projections for 1Q2022.  \nUpon approval of the universal service support mech-\nanisms quarterly funding requirements, projected ad-\nministrative costs and the contribution base, the Com-\nmission will establish a quarterly contribution factor \nand a circularity factor.9  USAC will then bill contribu-\ntors on a monthly basis for their individual obligations \nbased on the approved contribution factor and circular-\nity factor.10 \n \n \n \n6  Second Order on Reconsideration, 18 FCC Rcd at 4826, para. \n22. \n7  See Amendment of Part 54 of the Commission\u2019s Rules, Order, \n21 FCC Rcd 7422, 7423, and para. 4 (2006). \n8  Id. \n9  See 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.709(a)(3). \n10 Id. \n\n156a \n \nCONTRIBUTION BASE \nUSAC collects interstate and international projected \nrevenue information from carriers on the FCC Form \n499-Q (Form 499-Q) four times each year and submits \naggregate information on a quarterly basis to the FCC.11 \nCarriers also file the FCC Form 499-A (Form 499-A) \nin April of each year to report actual annual revenues \nfrom the prior year. USAC uses revenue data provided \nby carriers on the FCC Form 499-A to perform annual \ntrue-ups of actual revenue to the quarterly projected \nrevenue data submitted by carriers on FCC Form 499-\nQ during the prior calendar year. 12   As necessary, \nUSAC will refund or collect from carriers any over-pay-\nments or underpayments.  As mandated by the Com-\nmission, if the combined quarterly revenues reported by \na carrier on its Forms 499-Q are greater than those re-\nported on its annual revenue report on Form 499-A, then \na refund will be provided to the carrier based on an av-\nerage of the two lowest contribution factors for the \nyear.13  If the combined quarterly revenues reported \nby a carrier are less than those reported on its annual \nrevenue report on Form 499-A, then USAC will collect \n \n11 The FCC Form 499-Q includes a box for each of the quarterly \nfiling submissions.  Carriers check the appropriate box to indicate \nthe quarter for which revenue information is being reported.  \nData is due to USAC approximately one month before the filing is \ndue to the FCC. \n12 In addition, carriers may file a revised Form 499-Q within 45 \ndays of the original filing due date for the current quarter.  See \nProjected Collected Contribution Methodology Order, 17 FCC Rcd \nat 24972, para. 36. \n13 Id. \n\n157a \n \nthe difference from the carrier using an average of the \ntwo highest contribution factors from that year.14  \nCarriers were required to file the Form 499-Q with \n1Q2022 projected collected revenue information on or \nbefore November 1, 2021. 15   By December 2, 2021, \nUSAC is required to file revenue data with the FCC \nbased on the November 1, 2021 carrier filings.16  The \nCommission will use the program demand data and the \nprojected collected revenue to calculate the universal \nservice contribution factor for 1Q2022.17  The following \nchart provides the current Form 499-Q filing schedule: \nDue Dates \nProjected Collected Revenue for \nUSF contributions \nNovember 1, 2021 \n1Q:  January - March 2022 \nFebruary 1, 2022 \n2Q:  April - June 2022 \nMay 2, 2022 \n3Q:  July - September 2022 \nAugust 1, 2022 \n4Q:  October - December 2022 \nTelecommunications providers qualifying for the de \nminimis exemption from contribution requirements are \n \n14 Id. \n15  See FCC Form 499-Q, available at https://www.usac.org/ \nservice-providers/contributing-to-the-usf/forms-to-file/; see also \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.711. \n16 See 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.709(a). \n17 Id.

This \namount was derived using the projected collected reve-\nnue reported on the FCC Form 499-Q submissions.  In-\nterstate telecommunications service providers were re-\nquired to complete this form reporting January to \nMarch 2022 projected collected revenue information and \nreturn it by November 1, 2021.20  USAC has included \ncomplete revenue data from 4,775 carriers (3,112 con-\ntributors and 1,663 de minimis carriers). \nThe funding base for 1Q2022 is developed from the \nprojected collected revenues for 1Q2022 that were re-\nported by carriers in November 2021.  As of November \n19, 2021, USAC has yet to receive information from 132 \nnon-de minimis telecommunications service providers \nthat had previously submitted information to USAC.  \nFor the FCC\u2019s review of the 1Q2022 funding base for the \nsupport mechanisms, USAC includes estimated reve-\n \n18 See 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.708. \n19 47 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 54.711, 54.713. \n20 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.711(a). \n\n159a \n \nnues based on prior submissions for those carriers that \nfailed to submit a Form 499-Q.21 \nAppendix M05 provides a list of non-de minimis com-\npanies that have or should have filed the November 1, \n2021 Form 499-Q data as of November 19, 2021. \n \n \n \n \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUNIVERSAL SERVICE  \n \n \n \n \n \nADMINISTRATIVE COMPANY \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMichelle Garber, \n \n \n \n \n \nVice President of Finance and \n \n \n \n \n \nChief Financial Officer \n \n21 See 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.709(d). \n\n160a \n \nAPPENDIX E \n \nUNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS \nFOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT \n \nNo. 22-60008 \nCONSUMERS\u2019 RESEARCH; CAUSE BASED COMMERCE, \nINCORPORATED; KERSTEN CONWAY; SUZANNE BETTAC; \nROBERT KULL; KWANG JA KERBY; TOM KIRBY; JOSEPH \nBAYLY; JEREMY ROTH; DEANNA ROTH; LYNN GIBBS; \nPAUL GIBBS; RHONDA THOMAS, PETITIONERS \nv. \nFEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION;  \nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, RESPONDENTS \n \nFiled:  June 29, 2023 \n \nPetition for Review from and Order of the  \nFederal Communications Comm \nAgency No. 96-45 \n \nON PETITION FOR REHEARING EN BANC \n(Opinion March 24, 2023, 5 Cir., 2023, 63 F.4th 441) \n \nBefore RICHMAN, Chief Judge, and JONES, SMITH, \nSTEWART, ELROD, SOUTHWICK, HAYNES, GRAVES, HIG-\nGINSON, WILLETT, HO, DUNCAN, ENGELHARDT, OLD-\nHAM, WILSON, and DOUGLAS, Circuit Judges.  \n \n \n\n161a \n \nPER CURIAM:  \nA member of the court having requested a poll on the \npetition for rehearing en banc, and a majority of the cir-\ncuit judges in regular active service and not disqualified \nhaving voted in favor,  \nIT IS ORDERED that this cause shall be reheard by \nthe court en banc with oral argument on a date hereafter \nto be fixed.

In addition \nto the members of the Joint Board required un-\nder section 410(c) of this title, one member of such \nJoint Board shall be a State-appointed utility con-\nsumer advocate nominated by a national organization \nof State utility consumer advocates.  The Joint \nBoard shall, after notice and opportunity for public \ncomment, make its recommendations to the Commis-\nsion 9 months after February 8, 1996. \n(2) Commission action \n \nThe Commission shall initiate a single proceeding \nto implement the recommendations from the Joint \nBoard required by paragraph (1) and shall complete \nsuch proceeding within 15 months after February 8, \n1996.  The rules established by such proceeding \nshall include a definition of the services that are sup-\nported by Federal universal service support mecha-\n\n163a \n \nnisms and a specific timetable for implementation.  \nThereafter, the Commission shall complete any pro-\nceeding to implement subsequent recommendations \nfrom any Joint Board on universal service within one \nyear after receiving such recommendations. \n(b) \nUniversal service principles \nThe Joint Board and the Commission shall base poli-\ncies for the preservation and advancement of universal \nservice on the following principles: \n(1) Quality and rates \n \nQuality services should be available at just, rea-\nsonable, and affordable rates. \n(2) Access to advanced services \n \nAccess to advanced telecommunications and infor-\nmation services should be provided in all regions of \nthe Nation. \n(3) Access in rural and high cost areas \n \nConsumers in all regions of the Nation, including \nlow-income consumers and those in rural, insular, \nand high cost areas, should have access to telecom-\nmunications and information services, including \ninterexchange services and advanced telecommuni-\ncations and information services, that are reasonably \ncomparable to those services provided in urban areas \nand that are available at rates that are reasonably \ncomparable to rates charged for similar services in \nurban areas. \n(4) Equitable and nondiscriminatory contributions \n \nAll providers of telecommunications services \nshould make an equitable and nondiscriminatory con-\n\n164a \n \ntribution to the preservation and advancement of uni-\nversal service. \n(5) Specific and predictable support mechanisms \n \nThere should be specific, predictable and suffi-\ncient Federal and State mechanisms to preserve and \nadvance universal service. \n(6) Access to advanced telecommunications services \nfor schools, health care, and libraries \n \nElementary and secondary schools and class-\nrooms, health care providers, and libraries should \nhave access to advanced telecommunications services \nas described in subsection (h). \n(7) Additional principles \n \nSuch other principles as the Joint Board and the \nCommission determine are necessary and appropri-\nate for the protection of the public interest, conven-\nience, and necessity and are consistent with this \nchapter. \n(c) \nDefinition \n(1) In general \n \nUniversal service is an evolving level of telecom-\nmunications services that the Commission shall es-\ntablish periodically under this section, taking into ac-\ncount advances in telecommunications and informa-\ntion technologies and services.  The Joint Board in \nrecommending, and the Commission in establishing, \nthe definition of the services that are supported by \nFederal universal service support mechanisms shall \nconsider the extent to which such telecommunica-\ntions services\u2014 \n\n165a \n \n \n(A) \nare essential to education, public health, \nor public safety; \n \n(B) \nhave, through the operation of market \nchoices by customers, been subscribed to by a sub-\nstantial majority of residential customers; \n \n(C) \nare being deployed in public telecommu-\nnications networks by telecommunications carri-\ners; and \n \n(D) \nare consistent with the public interest, \nconvenience, and necessity. \n(2) Alterations and modifications \n \nThe Joint Board may, from time to time, recom-\nmend to the Commission modifications in the defini-\ntion of the services that are supported by Federal \nuniversal service support mechanisms. \n(3) Special services \n \nIn addition to the services included in the defini-\ntion of universal service under paragraph (1), the \nCommission may designate additional services for \nsuch support mechanisms for schools, libraries, and \nhealth care providers for the purposes of subsection \n(h). \n(d) \nTelecommunications carrier contribution \nEvery telecommunications carrier that provides in-\nterstate telecommunications services shall contribute, \non an equitable and nondiscriminatory basis, to the spe-\ncific, predictable, and sufficient mechanisms established \nby the Commission to preserve and advance universal \nservice.  The Commission may exempt a carrier or \nclass of carriers from this requirement if the carrier\u2019s \n\n166a \n \ntelecommunications activities are limited to such an ex-\ntent that the level of such carrier\u2019s contribution to the \npreservation and advancement of universal service \nwould be de minimis.  Any other provider of interstate \ntelecommunications may be required to contribute to \nthe preservation and advancement of universal service \nif the public interest so requires. \n(e) \nUniversal service support \nAfter the date on which Commission regulations im-\nplementing this section take effect, only an eligible tele-\ncommunications carrier designated under section 214(e) \nof this title shall be eligible to receive specific Federal uni-\nversal service support.  A carrier that receives such sup-\nport shall use that support only for the provision, mainte-\nnance, and upgrading of facilities and services for which \nthe support is intended.  Any such support should be \nexplicit and sufficient to achieve the purposes of this sec-\ntion. \n(f\u200a) \nState authority \nA State may adopt regulations not inconsistent with \nthe Commission\u2019s rules to preserve and advance univer-\nsal service.  Every telecommunications carrier that \nprovides intrastate telecommunications services shall \ncontribute, on an equitable and nondiscriminatory basis, \nin a manner determined by the State to the preservation \nand advancement of universal service in that State.  A \nState may adopt regulations to provide for additional \ndefinitions and standards to preserve and advance uni-\nversal service within that State only to the extent that \nsuch regulations adopt additional specific, predictable, \nand sufficient mechanisms to support such definitions or \n\n167a \n \nstandards that do not rely on or burden Federal univer-\nsal service support mechanisms. \n(g) \nInterexchange and interstate services \nWithin 6 months after February 8, 1996, the Commis-\nsion shall adopt rules to require that the rates charged \nby providers of interexchange telecommunications ser-\nvices to subscribers in rural and high cost areas shall be \nno higher than the rates charged by each such provider \nto its subscribers in urban areas.  Such rules shall also \nrequire that a provider of interstate interexchange tele-\ncommunications services shall provide such services to \nits subscribers in each State at rates no higher than the \nrates charged to its subscribers in any other State. \n(h) Telecommunications services for certain providers \n(1) In general \n \n(A) \nHealth care providers for rural areas \n \nA telecommunications carrier shall, upon re-\nceiving a bona fide request, provide telecommuni-\ncations services which are necessary for the pro-\nvision of health care services in a State, including \ninstruction relating to such services, to any public \nor nonprofit health care provider that serves per-\nsons who reside in rural areas in that State at \nrates that are reasonably comparable to rates \ncharged for similar services in urban areas in that \nState.  A telecommunications carrier providing \nservice under this paragraph shall be entitled to \nhave an amount equal to the difference, if any, be-\ntween the rates for services provided to health \ncare providers for rural areas in a State and the \nrates for similar services provided to other cus-\ntomers in comparable rural areas in that State \n\n168a \n \ntreated as a service obligation as a part of its obli-\ngation to participate in the mechanisms to pre-\nserve and advance universal service. \n \n(B) \nEducational providers and libraries \n \nAll telecommunications carriers serving a geo-\ngraphic area shall, upon a bona fide request for \nany of its services that are within the definition of \nuniversal service under subsection (c)(3), provide \nsuch services to elementary schools, secondary \nschools, and libraries for educational purposes at \nrates less than the amounts charged for similar \nservices to other parties.  The discount shall be \nan amount that the Commission, with respect to \ninterstate services, and the States, with respect to \nintrastate services, determine is appropriate and \nnecessary to ensure affordable access to and use \nof such services by such entities.  A telecommu-\nnications carrier providing service under this par-\nagraph shall\u2014 \n \n(i) \nhave an amount equal to the amount of \nthe discount treated as an offset to its obliga-\ntion to contribute to the mechanisms to pre-\nserve and advance universal service, or \n \n(ii) notwithstanding the provisions of sub-\nsection (e) of this section, receive reimburse-\nment utilizing the support mechanisms to pre-\nserve and advance universal service. \n(2) Advanced services \n \nThe Commission shall establish competitively \nneutral rules\u2014 \n\n169a \n \n \n(A) \nto enhance, to the extent technically fea-\nsible and economically reasonable, access to ad-\nvanced telecommunications and information ser-\nvices for all public and nonprofit elementary and \nsecondary school classrooms, health care provid-\ners, and libraries; and \n \n(B) \nto define the circumstances under which \na telecommunications carrier may be required to \nconnect its network to such public institutional tel-\necommunications users. \n(3) Terms and conditions \n \nTelecommunications services and network capac-\nity provided to a public institutional telecommunica-\ntions user under this subsection may not be sold, re-\nsold, or otherwise transferred by such user in consid-\neration for money or any other thing of value. \n(4) Eligibility of users \n \nNo entity listed in this subsection shall be entitled \nto preferential rates or treatment as required by this \nsubsection, if such entity operates as a for-profit \nbusiness, is a school described in paragraph (7)(A) \nwith an endowment of more than $50,000,000, or is a \nlibrary or library consortium not eligible for assis-\ntance from a State library administrative agency un-\nder the Library Services and Technology Act [20 \nU.S.C. 9121 et seq.]. \n \n \n\n170a \n \n(5) Requirements for certain schools with computers \nhaving Internet access \n \n(A) \nInternet safety \n \n \n(i) \nIn general \n \nExcept as provided in clause (ii), an elemen-\ntary or secondary school having computers \nwith Internet access may not receive services \nat discount rates under paragraph (1)(B) unless \nthe school, school board, local educational \nagency, or other authority with responsibility \nfor administration of the school\u2014 \n \n(I) \nsubmits to the Commission the cer-\ntifications described in subparagraphs (B) \nand (C); \n \n(II) submits to the Commission a certi-\nfication that an Internet safety policy has \nbeen adopted and implemented for the \nschool under subsection (l); and \n \n(III) ensures the use of such computers \nin accordance with the certifications. \n \n \n(ii) Applicability \n \nThe prohibition in clause (i) shall not apply \nwith respect to a school that receives services \nat discount rates under paragraph (1)(B) only \nfor purposes other than the provision of Inter-\nnet access, Internet service, or internal connec-\ntions. \n \n \n(iii) Public notice; hearing \n \nAn elementary or secondary school de-\nscribed in clause (i), or the school board, local \n\n171a \n \neducational agency, or other authority with re-\nsponsibility for administration of the school, \nshall provide reasonable public notice and hold \nat least one public hearing or meeting to ad-\ndress the proposed Internet safety policy.  In \nthe case of an elementary or secondary school \nother than an elementary school or a secondary \nschool as defined in section 7801 of title 20, the \nnotice and hearing required by this clause may \nbe limited to those members of the public with \na relationship to the school. \n \n(B) \nCertification with respect to minors \n \nA certification under this subparagraph is a \ncertification that the school, school board, local ed-\nucational agency, or other authority with respon-\nsibility for administration of the school\u2014 \n \n(i) \nis enforcing a policy of Internet safety \nfor minors that includes monitoring the online \nactivities of minors and the operation of a tech-\nnology protection measure with respect to any \nof its computers with Internet access that pro-\ntects against access through such computers to \nvisual depictions that are\u2014 \n \n \n \n \n(I) \nobscene;

To accurately predict the outcome, it is essential to analyze the specific legal arguments the parties are presenting to the Supreme Court. The proposed action\u2014searching for the brief of the respondent, Consumers' Research\u2014will provide exactly this information. This brief will detail the constitutional arguments against the FCC's funding scheme, likely drawing on originalist and textualist interpretations of legislative and executive power that may appeal to several justices. Accessing these core arguments is a critical step, moving beyond general case facts to the specific legal theories the Court will evaluate. Therefore, the action has a very high Task EIG.\n\nFrom a design perspective, this action tests and validates a core component of a systematic SCOTUS prediction strategy: after establishing the factual and procedural background, the next logical step is to acquire the primary legal briefs from the parties. This is a move from general information gathering to targeted retrieval of the most crucial documents. Successfully using this action reinforces the importance of this step in the workflow for any case. This provides a solid, though not revolutionary, gain in understanding effective prediction methodology, meriting a moderate Design EIG.",

The Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s March 24, 2023, vacated panel opinion \n(Pet.App.125a) is reported at 63 F.4th 441. \nJURISDICTION \nThis Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1254(1). The en banc Fifth Circuit entered its \njudgment on July 24, 2024. \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \nRespondents in this case (\u201cthe Challengers\u201d) have \nlong contended that the taxing system used to fund \nthe \nUniversal \nService \nFund \n(\u201cUSF\u201d) \nis \nunconstitutional under nondelegation principles. \nIndeed, the Challengers include all petitioners in two \nother cases currently pending before this Court \nraising nondelegation challenges to the USF. See \nConsumers\u2019 Research v. FCC, Nos. 23-456 & 23-743 \n(certiorari denied June 10, 2024; rehearing sought \nJune 18, 2024). Those cases arose out of the Sixth and \nEleventh Circuits, respectively. \nThe en banc Fifth Circuit\u2019s scholarly decision \nbelow adopted the Challengers\u2019 arguments and held \nthe USF funding mechanism violates Article I of the \nU.S. Constitution. As the en banc Fifth Circuit \nexplained, \u201cthere is no record of any government \nprogram like [the] USF in all the U.S. Reports.\u201d \nPet.App.67a. Rather than pay for a multi-billion-\ndollar social welfare program with an appropriation \nfrom \nfederal \nrevenues, \nCongress \nrequires \ntelecommunications carriers to contribute to the USF, \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(d), with carriers passing along a \nportion of that cost to consumers via line-item charges \nin their monthly phone bills, 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.712(a). \nThe collected funds are then redistributed by the \nprivate Universal Service Administrative Company \n(\u201cUSAC\u201d) to entities and projects that ostensibly will \nexpand telecommunications services. 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(b), (e). \n\n3 \n \nBut Congress imposed no formula, ceiling, or other \nmeaningful restrictions on how much money can be \nraised for the USF. To be sure, Congress provided a \nlist of universal service \u201cprinciples.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(b). But they are so amorphous and non-binding \nthat courts\u2014adopting the FCC\u2019s own language\u2014have \nlong labeled them \u201caspirational only,\u201d Tex. Off. of Pub. \nUtil. Couns. v. FCC, 265 F.3d 313, 321 (5th Cir. 2001), \nmeaning Congress \u201csuppl[ied] no principle at all,\u201d \nPet.App.27a. \nIn \naddition, \nCongress \nexpressly \nauthorized the FCC to redefine \u201cuniversal service\u201d and \n\u201cuniversal service principles\u201d as often as it wishes, \ngiving the agency even broader authority to raise \nbillions of dollars in taxes for a program designed to \nbenefit the country more broadly. See 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(b)(7), (c)(1). \nThe FCC then off-loaded authority over the USF to \nUSAC, a private entity of self-described industry \ninsiders with an incentive to push USF charges \nincreasingly higher. Each quarter, USAC exercises its \ndiscretion in determining the desired budget for the \nUSF, which includes the cost of funding USAC itself. \nThe FCC then ministerially converts that figure into \na contribution factor that will apply to certain \ntelecommunications revenues, and that tax rate is \nthen passively \u201cdeemed approved\u201d by the FCC 14 days \nlater, without the FCC ever taking any affirmative \naction or even issuing an approval order. 47 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 54.709(a)(3). There is no evidence the FCC itself \never actually reviews USAC\u2019s work or agrees with \nUSAC\u2019s discretionary decisions about how much \n\n4 \n \nmoney to raise, which is far from a ministerial \nundertaking. \nThis entire process happens only days before the \nnew quarter begins, giving the FCC no real option but \nto accept whatever numbers USAC demands. USAC \nthen collects the forced contributions and chooses how \nto disburse the funds. In essence, a private company \nis taxing Americans in amounts that total billions of \ndollars every year, under penalty of law, without true \ngovernmental accountability. \nThe en banc Fifth Circuit correctly held the USF\u2019s \nrevenue raising is unconstitutional under Article I of \nthe U.S. Constitution. See Pet.App.64a\u201381a. The \ncourt concluded there are \u201cgrave concerns about \n\u00a7 254\u2019s constitutionality under the Supreme Court\u2019s \nnondelegation precedents,\u201d as Congress handed over \nits core legislative taxing power to an agency with \nnothing \nmore \nthan \n\u201c\u2018aspirational\u2019\u201d \nlimits. \nPet.App.28a\u201329a, 42a. The Fifth Circuit also had \n\u201cserious trouble squaring FCC\u2019s subdelegation [to \nUSAC] with Article I, \u00a7 1 of the Constitution.\u201d \nPet.App.54a\u201355a. \nRather than hold independently unconstitutional \nCongress\u2019s delegation to the FCC and the FCC\u2019s \ndelegation to USAC, the Court concluded that the \ncombination \nwas \nunconstitutional. \n\u201c[T]he \nunprecedented nature of the delegation\u201d of broad \ntaxing power from Congress to the FCC, \u201ccombined \nwith other factors\u201d like the FCC\u2019s subsequent \nredelegation to USAC, was more than \u201cenough to hold \n[the USF] unlawful.\u201d Pet.App.42a. \n\n5 \n \nThe dual layers of delegation\u2014from Congress to \nthe FCC, then from the FCC to USAC\u2014\u201cobscure lines \nof accountability the Framers intended to be clear\u201d \nand \u201crender the promise of recourse to the judiciary \nillusory because they give reviewing courts no \nstandard against which to measure the compatibility \nof executive action with the prescriptions of the \npeople\u2019s elected representatives.\u201d Pet.App.75a. \nThe \nFifth \nCircuit \nconcluded: \n\u201cAmerican \ntelecommunications consumers are subject to a \nmultibillion-dollar tax nobody voted for. The size of \nthat tax is de facto determined by a trade group \nstaffed by industry insiders with no semblance of \naccountability to the public. And the trade group in \nturn relies on projections made by its private, for-\nprofit constituent companies, all of which stand to \nprofit \nfrom \nevery \nsingle \ntax \nincrease. \nThis \ncombination of delegations, subdelegations, and \nobfuscations of the USF Tax mechanism offends \nArticle I, \u00a7 1 of the Constitution.\u201d Pet.App.81a. \nConcurring, several judges would have gone \nfurther, explaining that \u201cCongress\u2019s delegation of \nlegislative power to the FCC and the FCC\u2019s delegation \nof the taxing power to a private entity each \nindividually contravene the separation of powers \nprinciple \nthat \nundergirds \nour \nConstitutional \nRepublic.\u201d Pet.App.82a (Elrod, J., joined by Ho & \nEnglehardt, JJ., concurring) (emphasis added). \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision was unsurprising. \nScholars had long flagged these serious constitutional \nflaws with the USF. \u201cUnlike the thousands of \n\n6 \n \nresponsibilities carried out by governmental agencies \non behalf of Congress, this delegation is unique \nbecause of the unfettered power given to the FCC in \ndefining the scope of universal service, and because \nCongress delegated the power to levy a tax to pay for \nthe service with no limits, knowing that the end user, \nthe American public, would ultimately be saddled \nwith the burden.\u201d Barbara A. Cherry & Donald D. \nNystrom, \nUniversal \nService \nContributions: \nAn \nUnconstitutional Delegation of Taxing Power, 2000 L. \nRev. Mich. St. U. Det. C.L. 107, 110. \nSimilarly, former FCC Commissioner Harold \nFurchtgott-Roth has written that the USF charges are \na \u201chidden tax\u201d where \u201c[t]he FCC, by its own logic, [has] \nas much authority to spend $2.25 trillion as it [has] to \nspend $2.25 billion.\u201d Harold W. Furchtgott-Roth, A \nTough Act to Follow? at 62, 72 (2006). \nThe Challengers consented to the government\u2019s \nrequest to stay the Fifth Circuit\u2019s mandate, on \ncondition that the government file its petition for a \nwrit of certiorari by September 30, 2024. The Fifth \nCircuit granted the government\u2019s request. See Order, \nConsumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, No. 22-60008 (5th Cir. Aug. \n26, 2024), ECF No. 349-2. \nDISCUSSION \nAs noted above, the Challengers filed petitions for \nwrits of certiorari from decisions by the Sixth and \nEleventh Circuits, which rejected the Challengers\u2019 \nnondelegation claims. See Consumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, \nNos. 23-456 & 23-743. The Challengers have sought \n\n7 \n \nrehearing of this Court\u2019s June 2024 denial of those \npetitions. Id. Those rehearing petitions remain \npending. \nGiven their own pending requests for this Court\u2019s \nreview of those adverse rulings, the Challengers agree \nthe constitutionality of the USF funding mechanism \nwarrants this Court\u2019s review. There is also now a \ncircuit split on whether that funding mechanism \nviolates nondelegation principles. \nTime is of the essence because the government \ncontinues to collect funds for the USF despite the \nFifth Circuit\u2019s holding below, as the Fifth Circuit \nagreed to stay its mandate on condition that the \ngovernment file its petition for a writ of certiorari by \nSeptember 30, 2024. See Order, Consumers\u2019 Rsch., No. \n22-60008 (5th Cir. Aug. 26, 2024). \nGiven the time sensitivity, the Court should grant \nthe petitions for rehearing and certiorari in Nos. 23-\n456 and 23-743, which are already fully briefed, and \nthus merits briefing can begin immediately. The \nCourt could then either consolidate all three cases, or \nhold this case pending a decision in Nos. 23-456 and \n23-743. \nThe Court should realign the parties for any \nconsolidated proceedings so the Challengers are \ntreated as petitioners, given that they first sought this \nCourt\u2019s review on these issues and have been \npetitioners in all lower-court proceedings. The Court \nhas previously realigned the parties in cases raising \nthe same issue, consistent with the parties\u2019 status in \n\n8 \n \nthe earlier-filed case. See, e.g., Axon Enter., Inc. v. \nFTC, No. 21-86 & SEC v. Cochran, No. 21-1239 \n(realigned parties so the Government was treated as \nrespondent in both cases); AMG Capital Mgmt., LLC \nv. FTC, No. 19-508 & FTC v. Credit Bureau Ctr., LLC, \nNo. 19-825 (similar). The Court has also previously \ngranted rehearing and then consolidated several \npending cases for merits briefing and argument. See, \ne.g., Al Odah v. United States, No. 06-1196 & \nBoumediene v. Bush, No. 06-1195. \n \n \n\n9 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe petitions for rehearing and for writs of \ncertiorari in Nos. 23-456 and 23-743 should be \ngranted. If the Court grants this case (No. 24-354), \ntoo, it should either hold it pending a decision in Nos. \n23-456 and 23-743, or consolidate the three cases and \nrealign the parties here so the Challengers are treated \nas petitioners. \nROBERT HENNEKE \nCHANCE WELDON \nTEXAS PUBLIC POLICY \nFOUNDATION \n901 Congress Avenue \nAustin, TX 78701 \n(512) 472-2700 \nrhenneke@texaspolicy.com \n \nR.

The Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s March 24, 2023, vacated panel opinion \n(Pet.App.125a) is reported at 63 F.4th 441. \nJURISDICTION \nThis Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1254(1). The en banc Fifth Circuit entered its \njudgment on July 24, 2024. \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \nRespondents in this case (\u201cthe Challengers\u201d) have \nlong contended that the taxing system used to fund \nthe \nUniversal \nService \nFund \n(\u201cUSF\u201d) \nis \nunconstitutional under nondelegation principles. \nIndeed, the Challengers include all petitioners in two \nother cases currently pending before this Court \nraising nondelegation challenges to the USF. See \nConsumers\u2019 Research v. FCC, Nos. 23-456 & 23-743 \n(certiorari denied June 10, 2024; rehearing sought \nJune 18, 2024). Those cases arose out of the Sixth and \nEleventh Circuits, respectively. \nThe en banc Fifth Circuit\u2019s scholarly decision \nbelow adopted the Challengers\u2019 arguments and held \nthe USF funding mechanism violates Article I of the \nU.S. Constitution. As the en banc Fifth Circuit \nexplained, \u201cthere is no record of any government \nprogram like [the] USF in all the U.S. Reports.\u201d \nPet.App.67a. Rather than pay for a multi-billion-\ndollar social welfare program with an appropriation \nfrom \nfederal \nrevenues, \nCongress \nrequires \ntelecommunications carriers to contribute to the USF, \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(d), with carriers passing along a \nportion of that cost to consumers via line-item charges \nin their monthly phone bills, 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.712(a). \nThe collected funds are then redistributed by the \nprivate Universal Service Administrative Company \n(\u201cUSAC\u201d) to entities and projects that ostensibly will \nexpand telecommunications services. 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(b), (e). \n\n3 \n \nBut Congress imposed no formula, ceiling, or other \nmeaningful restrictions on how much money can be \nraised for the USF. To be sure, Congress provided a \nlist of universal service \u201cprinciples.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(b). But they are so amorphous and non-binding \nthat courts\u2014adopting the FCC\u2019s own language\u2014have \nlong labeled them \u201caspirational only,\u201d Tex. Off. of Pub. \nUtil. Couns. v. FCC, 265 F.3d 313, 321 (5th Cir. 2001), \nmeaning Congress \u201csuppl[ied] no principle at all,\u201d \nPet.App.27a. \nIn \naddition, \nCongress \nexpressly \nauthorized the FCC to redefine \u201cuniversal service\u201d and \n\u201cuniversal service principles\u201d as often as it wishes, \ngiving the agency even broader authority to raise \nbillions of dollars in taxes for a program designed to \nbenefit the country more broadly. See 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(b)(7), (c)(1). \nThe FCC then off-loaded authority over the USF to \nUSAC, a private entity of self-described industry \ninsiders with an incentive to push USF charges \nincreasingly higher. Each quarter, USAC exercises its \ndiscretion in determining the desired budget for the \nUSF, which includes the cost of funding USAC itself. \nThe FCC then ministerially converts that figure into \na contribution factor that will apply to certain \ntelecommunications revenues, and that tax rate is \nthen passively \u201cdeemed approved\u201d by the FCC 14 days \nlater, without the FCC ever taking any affirmative \naction or even issuing an approval order. 47 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 54.709(a)(3). There is no evidence the FCC itself \never actually reviews USAC\u2019s work or agrees with \nUSAC\u2019s discretionary decisions about how much \n\n4 \n \nmoney to raise, which is far from a ministerial \nundertaking. \nThis entire process happens only days before the \nnew quarter begins, giving the FCC no real option but \nto accept whatever numbers USAC demands. USAC \nthen collects the forced contributions and chooses how \nto disburse the funds. In essence, a private company \nis taxing Americans in amounts that total billions of \ndollars every year, under penalty of law, without true \ngovernmental accountability. \nThe en banc Fifth Circuit correctly held the USF\u2019s \nrevenue raising is unconstitutional under Article I of \nthe U.S. Constitution. See Pet.App.64a\u201381a. The \ncourt concluded there are \u201cgrave concerns about \n\u00a7 254\u2019s constitutionality under the Supreme Court\u2019s \nnondelegation precedents,\u201d as Congress handed over \nits core legislative taxing power to an agency with \nnothing \nmore \nthan \n\u201c\u2018aspirational\u2019\u201d \nlimits. \nPet.App.28a\u201329a, 42a. The Fifth Circuit also had \n\u201cserious trouble squaring FCC\u2019s subdelegation [to \nUSAC] with Article I, \u00a7 1 of the Constitution.\u201d \nPet.App.54a\u201355a. \nRather than hold independently unconstitutional \nCongress\u2019s delegation to the FCC and the FCC\u2019s \ndelegation to USAC, the Court concluded that the \ncombination \nwas \nunconstitutional. \n\u201c[T]he \nunprecedented nature of the delegation\u201d of broad \ntaxing power from Congress to the FCC, \u201ccombined \nwith other factors\u201d like the FCC\u2019s subsequent \nredelegation to USAC, was more than \u201cenough to hold \n[the USF] unlawful.\u201d Pet.App.42a. \n\n5 \n \nThe dual layers of delegation\u2014from Congress to \nthe FCC, then from the FCC to USAC\u2014\u201cobscure lines \nof accountability the Framers intended to be clear\u201d \nand \u201crender the promise of recourse to the judiciary \nillusory because they give reviewing courts no \nstandard against which to measure the compatibility \nof executive action with the prescriptions of the \npeople\u2019s elected representatives.\u201d Pet.App.75a. \nThe \nFifth \nCircuit \nconcluded: \n\u201cAmerican \ntelecommunications consumers are subject to a \nmultibillion-dollar tax nobody voted for. The size of \nthat tax is de facto determined by a trade group \nstaffed by industry insiders with no semblance of \naccountability to the public. And the trade group in \nturn relies on projections made by its private, for-\nprofit constituent companies, all of which stand to \nprofit \nfrom \nevery \nsingle \ntax \nincrease. \nThis \ncombination of delegations, subdelegations, and \nobfuscations of the USF Tax mechanism offends \nArticle I, \u00a7 1 of the Constitution.\u201d Pet.App.81a. \nConcurring, several judges would have gone \nfurther, explaining that \u201cCongress\u2019s delegation of \nlegislative power to the FCC and the FCC\u2019s delegation \nof the taxing power to a private entity each \nindividually contravene the separation of powers \nprinciple \nthat \nundergirds \nour \nConstitutional \nRepublic.\u201d Pet.App.82a (Elrod, J., joined by Ho & \nEnglehardt, JJ., concurring) (emphasis added). \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision was unsurprising. \nScholars had long flagged these serious constitutional \nflaws with the USF. \u201cUnlike the thousands of \n\n6 \n \nresponsibilities carried out by governmental agencies \non behalf of Congress, this delegation is unique \nbecause of the unfettered power given to the FCC in \ndefining the scope of universal service, and because \nCongress delegated the power to levy a tax to pay for \nthe service with no limits, knowing that the end user, \nthe American public, would ultimately be saddled \nwith the burden.\u201d Barbara A. Cherry & Donald D. \nNystrom, \nUniversal \nService \nContributions: \nAn \nUnconstitutional Delegation of Taxing Power, 2000 L. \nRev. Mich. St. U. Det. C.L. 107, 110. \nSimilarly, former FCC Commissioner Harold \nFurchtgott-Roth has written that the USF charges are \na \u201chidden tax\u201d where \u201c[t]he FCC, by its own logic, [has] \nas much authority to spend $2.25 trillion as it [has] to \nspend $2.25 billion.\u201d Harold W. Furchtgott-Roth, A \nTough Act to Follow? at 62, 72 (2006). \nThe Challengers consented to the government\u2019s \nrequest to stay the Fifth Circuit\u2019s mandate, on \ncondition that the government file its petition for a \nwrit of certiorari by September 30, 2024. The Fifth \nCircuit granted the government\u2019s request. See Order, \nConsumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, No. 22-60008 (5th Cir. Aug. \n26, 2024), ECF No. 349-2. \nDISCUSSION \nAs noted above, the Challengers filed petitions for \nwrits of certiorari from decisions by the Sixth and \nEleventh Circuits, which rejected the Challengers\u2019 \nnondelegation claims. See Consumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, \nNos. 23-456 & 23-743. The Challengers have sought \n\n7 \n \nrehearing of this Court\u2019s June 2024 denial of those \npetitions. Id. Those rehearing petitions remain \npending. \nGiven their own pending requests for this Court\u2019s \nreview of those adverse rulings, the Challengers agree \nthe constitutionality of the USF funding mechanism \nwarrants this Court\u2019s review. There is also now a \ncircuit split on whether that funding mechanism \nviolates nondelegation principles. \nTime is of the essence because the government \ncontinues to collect funds for the USF despite the \nFifth Circuit\u2019s holding below, as the Fifth Circuit \nagreed to stay its mandate on condition that the \ngovernment file its petition for a writ of certiorari by \nSeptember 30, 2024. See Order, Consumers\u2019 Rsch., No. \n22-60008 (5th Cir. Aug. 26, 2024). \nGiven the time sensitivity, the Court should grant \nthe petitions for rehearing and certiorari in Nos. 23-\n456 and 23-743, which are already fully briefed, and \nthus merits briefing can begin immediately. The \nCourt could then either consolidate all three cases, or \nhold this case pending a decision in Nos. 23-456 and \n23-743. \nThe Court should realign the parties for any \nconsolidated proceedings so the Challengers are \ntreated as petitioners, given that they first sought this \nCourt\u2019s review on these issues and have been \npetitioners in all lower-court proceedings. The Court \nhas previously realigned the parties in cases raising \nthe same issue, consistent with the parties\u2019 status in \n\n8 \n \nthe earlier-filed case. See, e.g., Axon Enter., Inc. v. \nFTC, No. 21-86 & SEC v. Cochran, No. 21-1239 \n(realigned parties so the Government was treated as \nrespondent in both cases); AMG Capital Mgmt., LLC \nv. FTC, No. 19-508 & FTC v. Credit Bureau Ctr., LLC, \nNo. 19-825 (similar). The Court has also previously \ngranted rehearing and then consolidated several \npending cases for merits briefing and argument. See, \ne.g., Al Odah v. United States, No. 06-1196 & \nBoumediene v. Bush, No. 06-1195. \n \n \n\n9 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe petitions for rehearing and for writs of \ncertiorari in Nos. 23-456 and 23-743 should be \ngranted. If the Court grants this case (No. 24-354), \ntoo, it should either hold it pending a decision in Nos. \n23-456 and 23-743, or consolidate the three cases and \nrealign the parties here so the Challengers are treated \nas petitioners. \nROBERT HENNEKE \nCHANCE WELDON \nTEXAS PUBLIC POLICY \nFOUNDATION \n901 Congress Avenue \nAustin, TX 78701 \n(512) 472-2700 \nrhenneke@texaspolicy.com \n \nR.

This level of detail is crucial for predicting how individual Justices, particularly those with strong views on the nondelegation doctrine (like Gorsuch, Thomas, and Alito), will approach the case. It moves the analysis from a general understanding to a specific one based on the actual legal filings.\n\nDesign EIG is moderately high (0.6) because it reinforces a fundamental and effective strategy for SCOTUS prediction: start with the core documents that frame the dispute. Confirming the high value of retrieving the cert petition early on solidifies a key step in a robust, generalizable workflow. It teaches the agent to prioritize primary source documents over secondary summaries, which is a critical design principle for accurate legal reasoning.\n\nThe joint EIG is high because the action is both essential for the specific task and validates a core component of the overall prediction strategy.",

Apart from the merits, the only dispute between \nrespondents and the government concerns which peti-\ntions the Court should grant.  Respondents contend (Br. \n7) that, either in addition to or instead of granting the \npetition in this case, the Court should grant the peti-\ntions in Consumers\u2019 Research v. FCC, 144 S. Ct. 2628 \n(2024) (No. 23-456), and Consumers\u2019 Research v. FCC, 144 \nS. Ct. 2629 (2024) (No. 23-743), which seek review of deci-\nsions of the Sixth and Eleventh Circuits respectively.  \nIn the government\u2019s view, the Court should grant the \ntwo pending petitions that seek review of the Fifth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s decision\u2014the government\u2019s petition in this case \n\n2 \nand the private intervenors\u2019 petition in Schools, Health & \nLibraries Broadband Coalition v. Consumers\u2019 Research, \nNo. 24-422 (filed Oct. 11, 2024) (SHLB Coalition).  \n1. For multiple reasons, the two petitions seeking \nreview of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision are better vehicles \nfor clarifying the law in this sphere than the petitions \nseeking review of the Sixth and Eleventh Circuit deci-\nsions.  First, only the petitions seeking review of the \nFifth Circuit decision present all three of the potentially \ndispositive questions:  (1) whether Congress impermis-\nsibly delegated legislative power to the Federal Com-\nmunications Commission (FCC); (2) whether the FCC \nimpermissibly delegated governmental power to the \nAdministrator; and (3) whether the combination of the \ntwo alleged delegations violates the Constitution.  See \nPet. I; Pet. at i, SHLB Coalition, supra (No. 24-422).  \nThe other petitions for writs of certiorari, by contrast, \npresent only the first two questions.  The Sixth and \nEleventh Circuits did not specifically discuss whether \nthe combination of the two alleged delegations violates \nthe Constitution, and the petitions seeking review of \nthose circuits\u2019 decisions do not raise that question.  See \nPet. at i, Consumers\u2019 Research, supra (No. 23-456); Pet. \nat i, Consumers\u2019 Research, supra (No. 23-743).  \nSecond, the Fifth Circuit is the only court of appeals \nthat has found a nondelegation violation in the FCC\u2019s \nimplementation of 47 U.S.C. 254.  Granting certiorari in \nthis case would allow the Court to directly review the \nFifth Circuit\u2019s reasoning.  \nThird, this Court previously denied the petitions \nseeking review of the Sixth and Eleventh Circuit deci-\nsions.  See Consumers\u2019 Research, 144 S. Ct. at 2628; Con-\nsumers\u2019 Research, 144 S. Ct. at 2629.  Respondents have \nfiled petitions for rehearing in those cases.  But con-\ntrary to respondents\u2019 suggestion (Br. 7), the rehearing \n\n3 \npetitions are not yet \u201cfully briefed,\u201d since the Court has \nnot asked the government or the intervenors to file re-\nsponses to those petitions.  See Sup. Ct. R. 44.3 (\u201cIn the \nabsence of extraordinary circumstances, the Court will \nnot grant a petition for rehearing without first request-\ning a response.\u201d).  Granting either or both of those cer-\ntiorari petitions could therefore involve unnecessary de-\nlay.   \n2. Various private entities that intervened on the \ngovernment\u2019s side in the Fifth Circuit have filed their own \npetition for a writ of certiorari seeking review of the \nFifth Circuit\u2019s decision.  See Pet. at i, SHLB Coalition, \nsupra (No. 24-422).  When multiple parties have filed \npetitions seeking review of the same court of appeals \ndecision and this Court has concluded that the decision \nwarrants its review, the Court has often granted all the \npetitions and consolidated the cases.  See, e.g., Hewitt \nv. United States, 144 S. Ct. 2713 (2024) (No. 23-1002); \nYegiazaryan v. Smagin, 143 S. Ct. 645 (2023) (No. 22-\n381); Arizona v. Navajo Nation, 143 S. Ct. 398 (2022) \n(No. 21-1484).  Consistent with that practice, the Court \nshould grant the government\u2019s petition and the petition \nfiled by the intervenors and should consolidate the two \ncases.  Alternatively, the Court should grant the gov-\nernment\u2019s petition and hold the intervenors\u2019 petition.  \n\n4 \n*  *  *  *  * \nThe petitions for writs of certiorari in this case and \nin SHLB Coalition should be granted, and the cases \nshould be consolidated.  In the alternative, the petition \nin this case should be granted, and the petition in SHLB \nCoalition should be held pending the resolution of this \ncase.  Otherwise, both petitions should be held pending \nthe resolution of Wisconsin Bell v. United States ex rel. \nHeath, No. 23-1127 (oral argument scheduled for Nov. \n4, 2024), and then disposed of as appropriate.  \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nELIZABETH B.

We request that oral argument be divided as \n\n2 \n \nfollows:  20 minutes for the petitioners in No. 24-354 (federal \npetitioners) and 10 minutes for petitioners in No. 24-422 (private \npetitioners).  We also request that the federal petitioners be \nallowed to open the argument and to present rebuttal.  Counsel for \nthe private petitioners has authorized us to state that the private \npetitioners agree to this motion.  \nIn 47 U.S.C. 254, Congress directed the Federal Communica-\ntions Commission (FCC or Commission) to operate the Universal Ser-\nvice Fund using mandatory contributions from telecommunications \ncarriers.  The Commission has appointed a private company as the \nprograms\u2019 Administrator, authorizing that company to perform ad-\nministrative tasks such as sending out bills, collecting contri-\nbutions, and disbursing funds to beneficiaries.   \nRespondents filed a petition for review in the Fifth Circuit, \nchallenging an FCC order governing quarterly contribution amounts \non the ground that the regulatory scheme violated the nondelegation \ndoctrine.  See Pet. App. 11a.  Private petitioners -- groups of \nUniversal Service Fund beneficiaries -- intervened in support of \nthe government.  See Gov\u2019t Br. 8.  The en banc court of appeals \nheld that the combination of Congress\u2019s conferral of authority \nupon the FCC and the FCC\u2019s conferral of responsibility upon the \nAdministrator violates the nondelegation doctrine.  See Pet. App. \n1a-124a.   \nThe federal petitioners and private petitioners filed sepa-\nrate petitions for writs of certiorari seeking review of the court \n\n3 \n \nof appeals\u2019 judgment.  This Court granted certiorari and consoli-\ndated the cases.  \nDividing the argument time for petitioners would be of mate-\nrial assistance to this Court because the petitioners represent \ndistinct interests.  The federal petitioners have a significant \ninterest in defending the constitutionality of the applicable \nstatute and FCC rules, as well as in the scope of the nondelegation \ndoctrine more generally.  The private petitioners have a signifi-\ncant interest in the continued operation of the Universal Service \nFund in particular and are well positioned to explain the effects \nof the court of appeals\u2019 judgment on the Fund\u2019s beneficiaries.  \nSee, e.g., Competitive Carriers Ass\u2019n et al.

We request that oral argument be divided as \n\n2 \n \nfollows:  20 minutes for the petitioners in No. 24-354 (federal \npetitioners) and 10 minutes for petitioners in No. 24-422 (private \npetitioners).  We also request that the federal petitioners be \nallowed to open the argument and to present rebuttal.  Counsel for \nthe private petitioners has authorized us to state that the private \npetitioners agree to this motion.  \nIn 47 U.S.C. 254, Congress directed the Federal Communica-\ntions Commission (FCC or Commission) to operate the Universal Ser-\nvice Fund using mandatory contributions from telecommunications \ncarriers.  The Commission has appointed a private company as the \nprograms\u2019 Administrator, authorizing that company to perform ad-\nministrative tasks such as sending out bills, collecting contri-\nbutions, and disbursing funds to beneficiaries.   \nRespondents filed a petition for review in the Fifth Circuit, \nchallenging an FCC order governing quarterly contribution amounts \non the ground that the regulatory scheme violated the nondelegation \ndoctrine.  See Pet. App. 11a.  Private petitioners -- groups of \nUniversal Service Fund beneficiaries -- intervened in support of \nthe government.  See Gov\u2019t Br. 8.  The en banc court of appeals \nheld that the combination of Congress\u2019s conferral of authority \nupon the FCC and the FCC\u2019s conferral of responsibility upon the \nAdministrator violates the nondelegation doctrine.  See Pet. App. \n1a-124a.   \nThe federal petitioners and private petitioners filed sepa-\nrate petitions for writs of certiorari seeking review of the court \n\n3 \n \nof appeals\u2019 judgment.  This Court granted certiorari and consoli-\ndated the cases.  \nDividing the argument time for petitioners would be of mate-\nrial assistance to this Court because the petitioners represent \ndistinct interests.  The federal petitioners have a significant \ninterest in defending the constitutionality of the applicable \nstatute and FCC rules, as well as in the scope of the nondelegation \ndoctrine more generally.  The private petitioners have a signifi-\ncant interest in the continued operation of the Universal Service \nFund in particular and are well positioned to explain the effects \nof the court of appeals\u2019 judgment on the Fund\u2019s beneficiaries.  \nSee, e.g., Competitive Carriers Ass\u2019n et al.

      "eig_reasoning": "This action seeks to retrieve the 'Petition for a writ of certiorari,' which is the foundational document outlining the petitioner's (Consumers' Research) arguments for why the Supreme Court should hear the case and overturn the lower court's decision. \n\nTask EIG is very high (0.9) because this document will provide the most detailed and direct explanation of the petitioner's legal strategy. It will clarify the precise framing of the nondelegation arguments, the specific precedents they are relying on or asking the Court to reconsider, and the overall strength of their case from their perspective. This is a primary source document that moves beyond the case summary to the actual legal reasoning being presented to the Court, which is essential for an accurate prediction.\n\nDesign EIG is moderately high (0.6) because it reinforces a crucial and effective strategy for SCOTUS case analysis: always start by analyzing the primary briefing documents. Confirming that the petition for certiorari provides a high-value, structured overview of one party's entire case helps solidify the agent's understanding of an optimal information-gathering workflow. While not a novel strategy, its consistent application and confirmed utility are important for refining the agent's design.\n\nThe joint EIG is high because the action is both critical for understanding the specifics of this particular case and for validating a core component of a generalizable prediction methodology.",

The \nCommission has appointed a private company as the \nprograms\u2019 Administrator, authorizing that company to \nperform administrative tasks such as sending out bills, \ncollecting contributions, and disbursing funds to bene-\nficiaries.  The questions presented are as follows:  \n1. Whether Congress violated the nondelegation \ndoctrine by authorizing the Commission to determine, \nwithin the limits set forth in Section 254, the amount \nthat providers must contribute to the Fund.  \n2. Whether the Commission violated the nondelega-\ntion doctrine by using the Administrator\u2019s financial pro-\njections in computing universal service contribution \nrates.  \n3. Whether the combination of Congress\u2019s conferral \nof authority on the Commission and the Commission\u2019s \ndelegation of administrative responsibilities to the Ad-\nministrator violates the nondelegation doctrine. \n \n \n\n(II) \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nThe following parties are petitioners here and were \nrespondents below:   the Federal Communications Com-\nmission and the United States of America.   \nThe following parties are respondents here and were \npetitioners below:  Consumers\u2019 Research; Cause Based \nCommerce, Inc.; Joseph Bayly; Suzanne Bettac; Ker-\nsten Conway; Lynn Gibbs; Paul Gibbs; Kwang Ja \nKerby; Tom Kirby; Robert Kull; Deanna Roth; Jeremy \nRoth; and Rhonda Thomas.  \nThe following parties were intervenors below: Ben-\nton Institute for Broadband and Society; Center for Me-\ndia Justice, d/b/a MediaJustice; Competitive Carriers \nAssociation; National Digital Inclusion Alliance; Na-\ntional Telecommunications Cooperative Association, \nd/b/a NTCA\u2014The Rural Broadband Association; \nSchools, Health and Libraries Broadband Coalition; \nand U.S. Telecom\u2014The Broadband Association.  \nRELATED PROCEEDING \nUnited States Court of Appeals (5th Cir.): \nConsumers\u2019 Research v.

The opinion \nof the court of appeals panel (App., infra, 125a-141a) is \nreported at 63 F.4th 441.  \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the en banc court of appeals was en-\ntered on July 24, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court is \ninvoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent statutory provisions are reproduced in the \nappendix.  App., infra, 162a-187a. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Universal Service Fund \n1. In the Communications Act of 1934 (Act), 47 \nU.S.C. 151 et seq., Congress established the Federal \nCommunications Commission (FCC or Commission).  \nOne of the Act\u2019s fundamental goals, and one of the \nFCC\u2019s core missions, is promoting universal service\u2014\ni.e., ensuring the availability of affordable and reliable \ntelecommunications services throughout the United \nStates.  See AT&T, Inc. v. FCC, 886 F.3d 1236, 1241 \n(D.C. Cir. 2018).  Congress referenced that mission in \nthe statutory text, directing the agency to \u201cmake avail-\nable, so far as possible, to all the people of the United \nStates,  * * *  a rapid, efficient, Nation-wide, and world-\nwide wire and radio communication service with ade-\nquate facilities at reasonable charges.\u201d  47 U.S.C. 151.  \nFor the first half-century of its existence, the FCC \nachieved universal service primarily by regulating \nrates.  See Verizon Communications Inc. v. FCC, 535 \nU.S. 467, 480 (2002).  For example, the Commission re-\nquired telephone monopolies to charge below-cost rates \nin rural areas, while allowing them to charge above-cost \nrates in cities.  See ibid.  Through that approach, urban \ncustomers effectively subsidized the provision of tele-\nphone service to rural customers.  See ibid.  \nIn 1996, Congress overhauled the Act in order to \npromote competition and eliminate monopolies in the \ntelecommunications industry.  See Telecommunications \nAct of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-104, 110 Stat. 56.  As part \nof those reforms, Congress established a new frame-\nwork for achieving universal service.  See 47 U.S.C. 254.  \n\n3 \n \nThe amended Act directs the FCC to establish a set of \nprograms known collectively as the Universal Service \nFund (Fund).  See 47 U.S.C. 254(a).  It requires carriers \nthat provide interstate telecommunications services to \n\u201ccontribute\u201d to the Fund \u201con an equitable and nondis-\ncriminatory basis.\u201d  47 U.S.C. 254(d).  The Commission \nmust use the money in the Fund to subsidize universal \nservice.  See 47 U.S.C. 254(e).   \nThe Act\u2019s provisions guide and limit the FCC\u2019s exer-\ncise of that authority.  The Act requires the Commission \nto \u201cbase policies for the preservation and advancement \nof universal service\u201d on a series of specific \u201cprinciples\u201d \n\u2014for example, the principle that consumers in rural ar-\neas \u201cshould have access to telecommunications and in-\nformation services  * * *  that are reasonably compara-\nble to those services provided in urban areas.\u201d  47 \nU.S.C. 254(b)(3); see 47 U.S.C. 254(b).  The Act also re-\nquires the Commission, when deciding whether to sub-\nsidize a service, to consider certain factors\u2014for exam-\nple, the extent to which the service in question is \u201ces-\nsential to education, public health, or public safety.\u201d  47 \nU.S.C. 254(c)(1)(A); see 47 U.S.C. 254(c)(1).  \nIn accordance with the Act, the Commission has es-\ntablished four universal service programs, which assist \n(1) deployment in remote areas, (2) low-income consum-\ners, (3) schools and libraries, and (4) rural healthcare \nproviders.  See 47 C.F.R. 54.302-54.322, 54.400-54.424, \n54.500-54.523, 54.600-54.633, 54.801-54.1524.  All four \nprograms subsidize telephone and broadband services, \nsee 47 C.F.R. 54.101, and the program for schools and \nlibraries subsidizes internal connections as well, see 47 \nC.F.R. 54.502(a).   \n2. In 1997, the FCC directed the creation of the Uni-\nversal Service Administrative Company (Company) to \n\n4 \n \nhelp it administer the Fund.  See In re Changes to the \nBoard of Directors of the National Exchange Carrier \nAss\u2019n, Inc., 12 FCC Rcd 18,400, 18,418-18,419 (1997).  \nThe Company is a private, not-for-profit corporation \nchartered in Delaware.  See App., infra, 59a. \nAlthough the Company is a private body, it remains \nsubject to the Commission\u2019s oversight and control.  Its \nsole stockholder, an association of carriers, must \u201cact in \ncompliance with the [FCC\u2019s] Rules and Orders when ex-\nercising its stockholder duties and powers.\u201d  Amended \nand Restated By-Laws of Universal Service Adminis-\ntrative Company, Art. I, \u00b6 1 (rev. Jan. 26, 2024).  FCC \nrules identify the groups represented on the Company\u2019s \nBoard of Directors (e.g., consumers, carriers, and recip-\nients of universal service funding), and the FCC Chair \nselects directors after reviewing nominations from \nthose groups.  See 47 C.F.R. 54.703(b).  The Company \nalso must obtain the Commission\u2019s approval of its \nbudget.  See 47 C.F.R. 54.715(c).  \nThe FCC has \u201cappointed\u201d the Company as the \nFund\u2019s \u201cpermanent Administrator.\u201d  47 C.F.R. 54.701(a).  \nIn that role, the Company provides financial projections \nthat the FCC uses each quarter in computing the \namounts of universal service contributions.  See 47 \nC.F.R. 54.709.  The Administrator also sends out bills \nand collects contributions.  See 47 C.F.R. 54.702(b).  Fi-\nnally, the Administrator disburses money to program \nbeneficiaries in accordance with FCC rules.  See ibid.  \nAlthough the Administrator performs administra-\ntive tasks on the FCC\u2019s behalf, it exercises no independ-\nent regulatory power.  It \u201cmay not make policy, inter-\npret unclear provisions of the statute or rules, or inter-\npret the intent of Congress.\u201d  47 C.F.R. 54.702(c).  It \nmust comply with the Commission\u2019s rules, see 47 C.F.R. \n\n5 \n \n54.701-54.717, and any party that is aggrieved by its de-\ncisions may request de novo review by the Commission, \nsee 47 C.F.R. 54.719-54.725. \n3. The FCC\u2019s rules prescribe a process for compu-\nting each carrier\u2019s quarterly contribution to the Fund.  \nSee 47 C.F.R. 54.709.  At least 60 days before the begin-\nning of each quarter, the Administrator must submit to \nthe Commission its projections of the expenses (bene-\nfits plus administrative overhead) that the four univer-\nsal service programs will incur, along with \u201cthe basis for \nthose projections.\u201d  47 C.F.R. 54.709(a)(3).  And at least \n30 days before the beginning of each quarter, the Ad-\nministrator must submit a projection of the total reve-\nnues that telecommunications carriers will earn from \ninterstate and international telecommunications ser-\nvices, based on financial information provided by those \ncarriers.  See ibid. \nThe FCC uses those projections to calculate a \u201ccon-\ntribution factor\u201d\u2014i.e., a number that is based on the ra-\ntio of the projected expenses to the projected revenues.  \n47 C.F.R. 54.709(a)(2).  The Commission then announces \nthe projections and proposed contribution factor to the \npublic.  See 47 C.F.R. 54.709(a)(3).  The FCC may revise \nthe projections (and thus the contribution factor) and \nmay set them \u201cat amounts that the Commission deter-\nmines will serve the public interest.\u201d  Ibid.  If the Com-\nmission takes no action within 14 days after the an-\nnouncement, however, the projections and contribution \nfactor are \u201cdeemed approved.\u201d  Ibid. \nOnce the FCC approves the contribution factor, the \nAdministrator calculates each carrier\u2019s contribution by \napplying the factor to that carrier\u2019s \u201ccontribution base\u201d \n(generally, the carrier\u2019s interstate and international tel-\necommunications revenues).  47 C.F.R. 54.709(a)(3).  \n\n6 \n \nFor example, if the contribution factor is 25%, each car-\nrier would owe 25% of its interstate and international \ntelecommunications revenues.  Carriers may pass the \ncost of their contributions on to customers.  See 47 \nC.F.R. 54.712(a). \nB. Proceedings Below \n1. In November 2021, the Administrator submitted \nits projections of expenses and revenues for the first \nquarter of 2022.  See App., infra, 150a-159a.  Based on \nthose projections, the Commission proposed a contribu-\ntion factor of 25.2%.  See id. at 141a-149a.   \nRespondents\u2014a nonprofit organization, a carrier, \nand a group of consumers\u2014filed comments requesting \nthat the FCC set the contribution factor at 0% instead.  \nSee Gov\u2019t C.A. Br. 17.  Respondents did not object to \nthe Administrator\u2019s projections or to the Commission\u2019s \ncomputation of the contribution factor based on those \nprojections.  Respondents instead argued that the uni-\nversal service program was itself unlawful.  See App., \ninfra, 11a.  They contended that Congress had uncon-\nstitutionally delegated legislative power to the FCC and \nthat the Commission had unconstitutionally redelegated \npower to the Administrator.  See ibid.   \nThe Commission took no further action within 14 \ndays after publishing the proposed contribution factor.  \nSee App., infra, 11a.  As a result, the factor was deemed \napproved.  See ibid.  \n2. Respondents filed a petition for review in the \nFifth Circuit.  See App., infra, 11a.  A unanimous panel \ndenied the petition.  See id. at 125a-140a.  \nThe panel first rejected the FCC\u2019s argument that the \npetition for review was untimely because \u201cany challenge \nto \u00a7 254 should have come when Congress originally en-\nacted it.\u201d  App., infra, 128a.  The panel reasoned that \n\n7 \n \nthe Commission had \u201creapplied\u201d Section 254 when it \nadopted the contribution factor for the first quarter of \n2022 and that respondents therefore could properly \nraise their constitutional claim as part of their challenge \nto that agency action.  Id. at 129a.  \nOn the merits, the panel rejected respondents\u2019 claim \nthat Congress in enacting Section 254 had unconstitu-\ntionally delegated legislative power to the FCC.  See \nApp., infra, 132a-137a.  The panel determined that Sec-\ntion 254 sets forth \u201cnumerous intelligible principles\u201d \nthat constrain the FCC\u2019s exercise of its authority.  Id. \nat 137a.  The panel also rejected respondents\u2019 claim that \nthe Commission had unconstitutionally delegated gov-\nernmental power to the Company.  See id. at 137a-140a.  \nThe panel emphasized that the Company lacks inde-\npendent regulatory authority and functions \u201csubordi-\nnate[ly]\u201d to the Commission.  Id. at 140a.  \n3. The court of appeals granted respondents\u2019 peti-\ntion for rehearing en banc.  See App., infra, 160a-161a.  \nThe en banc court granted respondents\u2019 petition for re-\nview by a vote of 9-7.  See id. at 1a-118a.  \nThe en banc court held that no procedural obstacle \nprevented it from reaching the merits of the petition for \nreview.  See App., infra, 11a-18a.  The court observed \nthat respondents\u2019 challenge to the specific FCC action \nat issue here\u2014i.e., the contribution factor that the Com-\nmission had established for the first quarter of 2022\u2014\n\u201cmight be moot\u201d because sovereign immunity might \npreclude recovery of money already paid into the Uni-\nversal Service Fund.  Id. at 13a.  The court held, how-\never, that the case \u201cis nonetheless justiciable because it \nis capable of repetition yet eva\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

The \nCommission has appointed a private company as the \nprograms\u2019 Administrator, authorizing that company to \nperform administrative tasks such as sending out bills, \ncollecting contributions, and disbursing funds to bene-\nficiaries.  The questions presented are as follows:  \n1. Whether Congress violated the nondelegation \ndoctrine by authorizing the Commission to determine, \nwithin the limits set forth in Section 254, the amount \nthat providers must contribute to the Fund.  \n2. Whether the Commission violated the nondelega-\ntion doctrine by using the Administrator\u2019s financial pro-\njections in computing universal service contribution \nrates.  \n3. Whether the combination of Congress\u2019s conferral \nof authority on the Commission and the Commission\u2019s \ndelegation of administrative responsibilities to the Ad-\nministrator violates the nondelegation doctrine. \n \n \n\n(II) \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nThe following parties are petitioners here and were \nrespondents below:   the Federal Communications Com-\nmission and the United States of America.   \nThe following parties are respondents here and were \npetitioners below:  Consumers\u2019 Research; Cause Based \nCommerce, Inc.; Joseph Bayly; Suzanne Bettac; Ker-\nsten Conway; Lynn Gibbs; Paul Gibbs; Kwang Ja \nKerby; Tom Kirby; Robert Kull; Deanna Roth; Jeremy \nRoth; and Rhonda Thomas.  \nThe following parties were intervenors below: Ben-\nton Institute for Broadband and Society; Center for Me-\ndia Justice, d/b/a MediaJustice; Competitive Carriers \nAssociation; National Digital Inclusion Alliance; Na-\ntional Telecommunications Cooperative Association, \nd/b/a NTCA\u2014The Rural Broadband Association; \nSchools, Health and Libraries Broadband Coalition; \nand U.S. Telecom\u2014The Broadband Association.  \nRELATED PROCEEDING \nUnited States Court of Appeals (5th Cir.): \nConsumers\u2019 Research v.

The jurisdiction of this Court is \ninvoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent statutory provisions are reproduced in the \nappendix.  App., infra, 162a-187a. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Universal Service Fund \n1. In the Communications Act of 1934 (Act), 47 \nU.S.C. 151 et seq., Congress established the Federal \nCommunications Commission (FCC or Commission).  \nOne of the Act\u2019s fundamental goals, and one of the \nFCC\u2019s core missions, is promoting universal service\u2014\ni.e., ensuring the availability of affordable and reliable \ntelecommunications services throughout the United \nStates.  See AT&T, Inc. v. FCC, 886 F.3d 1236, 1241 \n(D.C. Cir. 2018).  Congress referenced that mission in \nthe statutory text, directing the agency to \u201cmake avail-\nable, so far as possible, to all the people of the United \nStates,  * * *  a rapid, efficient, Nation-wide, and world-\nwide wire and radio communication service with ade-\nquate facilities at reasonable charges.\u201d  47 U.S.C. 151.  \nFor the first half-century of its existence, the FCC \nachieved universal service primarily by regulating \nrates.  See Verizon Communications Inc. v. FCC, 535 \nU.S. 467, 480 (2002).  For example, the Commission re-\nquired telephone monopolies to charge below-cost rates \nin rural areas, while allowing them to charge above-cost \nrates in cities.  See ibid.  Through that approach, urban \ncustomers effectively subsidized the provision of tele-\nphone service to rural customers.  See ibid.  \nIn 1996, Congress overhauled the Act in order to \npromote competition and eliminate monopolies in the \ntelecommunications industry.  See Telecommunications \nAct of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-104, 110 Stat. 56.  As part \nof those reforms, Congress established a new frame-\nwork for achieving universal service.  See 47 U.S.C. 254.  \n\n3 \n \nThe amended Act directs the FCC to establish a set of \nprograms known collectively as the Universal Service \nFund (Fund).  See 47 U.S.C. 254(a).  It requires carriers \nthat provide interstate telecommunications services to \n\u201ccontribute\u201d to the Fund \u201con an equitable and nondis-\ncriminatory basis.\u201d  47 U.S.C. 254(d).  The Commission \nmust use the money in the Fund to subsidize universal \nservice.  See 47 U.S.C. 254(e).   \nThe Act\u2019s provisions guide and limit the FCC\u2019s exer-\ncise of that authority.  The Act requires the Commission \nto \u201cbase policies for the preservation and advancement \nof universal service\u201d on a series of specific \u201cprinciples\u201d \n\u2014for example, the principle that consumers in rural ar-\neas \u201cshould have access to telecommunications and in-\nformation services  * * *  that are reasonably compara-\nble to those services provided in urban areas.\u201d  47 \nU.S.C. 254(b)(3); see 47 U.S.C. 254(b).  The Act also re-\nquires the Commission, when deciding whether to sub-\nsidize a service, to consider certain factors\u2014for exam-\nple, the extent to which the service in question is \u201ces-\nsential to education, public health, or public safety.\u201d  47 \nU.S.C. 254(c)(1)(A); see 47 U.S.C. 254(c)(1).  \nIn accordance with the Act, the Commission has es-\ntablished four universal service programs, which assist \n(1) deployment in remote areas, (2) low-income consum-\ners, (3) schools and libraries, and (4) rural healthcare \nproviders.  See 47 C.F.R. 54.302-54.322, 54.400-54.424, \n54.500-54.523, 54.600-54.633, 54.801-54.1524.  All four \nprograms subsidize telephone and broadband services, \nsee 47 C.F.R. 54.101, and the program for schools and \nlibraries subsidizes internal connections as well, see 47 \nC.F.R. 54.502(a).   \n2. In 1997, the FCC directed the creation of the Uni-\nversal Service Administrative Company (Company) to \n\n4 \n \nhelp it administer the Fund.  See In re Changes to the \nBoard of Directors of the National Exchange Carrier \nAss\u2019n, Inc., 12 FCC Rcd 18,400, 18,418-18,419 (1997).  \nThe Company is a private, not-for-profit corporation \nchartered in Delaware.  See App., infra, 59a. \nAlthough the Company is a private body, it remains \nsubject to the Commission\u2019s oversight and control.  Its \nsole stockholder, an association of carriers, must \u201cact in \ncompliance with the [FCC\u2019s] Rules and Orders when ex-\nercising its stockholder duties and powers.\u201d  Amended \nand Restated By-Laws of Universal Service Adminis-\ntrative Company, Art. I, \u00b6 1 (rev. Jan. 26, 2024).  FCC \nrules identify the groups represented on the Company\u2019s \nBoard of Directors (e.g., consumers, carriers, and recip-\nients of universal service funding), and the FCC Chair \nselects directors after reviewing nominations from \nthose groups.  See 47 C.F.R. 54.703(b).  The Company \nalso must obtain the Commission\u2019s approval of its \nbudget.  See 47 C.F.R. 54.715(c).  \nThe FCC has \u201cappointed\u201d the Company as the \nFund\u2019s \u201cpermanent Administrator.\u201d  47 C.F.R. 54.701(a).  \nIn that role, the Company provides financial projections \nthat the FCC uses each quarter in computing the \namounts of universal service contributions.  See 47 \nC.F.R. 54.709.  The Administrator also sends out bills \nand collects contributions.  See 47 C.F.R. 54.702(b).  Fi-\nnally, the Administrator disburses money to program \nbeneficiaries in accordance with FCC rules.  See ibid.  \nAlthough the Administrator performs administra-\ntive tasks on the FCC\u2019s behalf, it exercises no independ-\nent regulatory power.  It \u201cmay not make policy, inter-\npret unclear provisions of the statute or rules, or inter-\npret the intent of Congress.\u201d  47 C.F.R. 54.702(c).  It \nmust comply with the Commission\u2019s rules, see 47 C.F.R. \n\n5 \n \n54.701-54.717, and any party that is aggrieved by its de-\ncisions may request de novo review by the Commission, \nsee 47 C.F.R. 54.719-54.725. \n3. The FCC\u2019s rules prescribe a process for compu-\nting each carrier\u2019s quarterly contribution to the Fund.  \nSee 47 C.F.R. 54.709.  At least 60 days before the begin-\nning of each quarter, the Administrator must submit to \nthe Commission its projections of the expenses (bene-\nfits plus administrative overhead) that the four univer-\nsal service programs will incur, along with \u201cthe basis for \nthose projections.\u201d  47 C.F.R. 54.709(a)(3).  And at least \n30 days before the beginning of each quarter, the Ad-\nministrator must submit a projection of the total reve-\nnues that telecommunications carriers will earn from \ninterstate and international telecommunications ser-\nvices, based on financial information provided by those \ncarriers.  See ibid. \nThe FCC uses those projections to calculate a \u201ccon-\ntribution factor\u201d\u2014i.e., a number that is based on the ra-\ntio of the projected expenses to the projected revenues.  \n47 C.F.R. 54.709(a)(2).  The Commission then announces \nthe projections and proposed contribution factor to the \npublic.  See 47 C.F.R. 54.709(a)(3).  The FCC may revise \nthe projections (and thus the contribution factor) and \nmay set them \u201cat amounts that the Commission deter-\nmines will serve the public interest.\u201d  Ibid.  If the Com-\nmission takes no action within 14 days after the an-\nnouncement, however, the projections and contribution \nfactor are \u201cdeemed approved.\u201d  Ibid. \nOnce the FCC approves the contribution factor, the \nAdministrator calculates each carrier\u2019s contribution by \napplying the factor to that carrier\u2019s \u201ccontribution base\u201d \n(generally, the carrier\u2019s interstate and international tel-\necommunications revenues).  47 C.F.R. 54.709(a)(3).  \n\n6 \n \nFor example, if the contribution factor is 25%, each car-\nrier would owe 25% of its interstate and international \ntelecommunications revenues.  Carriers may pass the \ncost of their contributions on to customers.  See 47 \nC.F.R. 54.712(a). \nB. Proceedings Below \n1. In November 2021, the Administrator submitted \nits projections of expenses and revenues for the first \nquarter of 2022.  See App., infra, 150a-159a.  Based on \nthose projections, the Commission proposed a contribu-\ntion factor of 25.2%.  See id. at 141a-149a.   \nRespondents\u2014a nonprofit organization, a carrier, \nand a group of consumers\u2014filed comments requesting \nthat the FCC set the contribution factor at 0% instead.  \nSee Gov\u2019t C.A. Br. 17.  Respondents did not object to \nthe Administrator\u2019s projections or to the Commission\u2019s \ncomputation of the contribution factor based on those \nprojections.  Respondents instead argued that the uni-\nversal service program was itself unlawful.  See App., \ninfra, 11a.  They contended that Congress had uncon-\nstitutionally delegated legislative power to the FCC and \nthat the Commission had unconstitutionally redelegated \npower to the Administrator.  See ibid.   \nThe Commission took no further action within 14 \ndays after publishing the proposed contribution factor.  \nSee App., infra, 11a.  As a result, the factor was deemed \napproved.  See ibid.  \n2. Respondents filed a petition for review in the \nFifth Circuit.  See App., infra, 11a.  A unanimous panel \ndenied the petition.  See id. at 125a-140a.  \nThe panel first rejected the FCC\u2019s argument that the \npetition for review was untimely because \u201cany challenge \nto \u00a7 254 should have come when Congress originally en-\nacted it.\u201d  App., infra, 128a.  The panel reasoned that \n\n7 \n \nthe Commission had \u201creapplied\u201d Section 254 when it \nadopted the contribution factor for the first quarter of \n2022 and that respondents therefore could properly \nraise their constitutional claim as part of their challenge \nto that agency action.  Id. at 129a.  \nOn the merits, the panel rejected respondents\u2019 claim \nthat Congress in enacting Section 254 had unconstitu-\ntionally delegated legislative power to the FCC.  See \nApp., infra, 132a-137a.  The panel determined that Sec-\ntion 254 sets forth \u201cnumerous intelligible principles\u201d \nthat constrain the FCC\u2019s exercise of its authority.  Id. \nat 137a.  The panel also rejected respondents\u2019 claim that \nthe Commission had unconstitutionally delegated gov-\nernmental power to the Company.  See id. at 137a-140a.  \nThe panel emphasized that the Company lacks inde-\npendent regulatory authority and functions \u201csubordi-\nnate[ly]\u201d to the Commission.  Id. at 140a.  \n3. The court of appeals granted respondents\u2019 peti-\ntion for rehearing en banc.  See App., infra, 160a-161a.  \nThe en banc court granted respondents\u2019 petition for re-\nview by a vote of 9-7.  See id. at 1a-118a.  \nThe en banc court held that no procedural obstacle \nprevented it from reaching the merits of the petition for \nreview.  See App., infra, 11a-18a.  The court observed \nthat respondents\u2019 challenge to the specific FCC action \nat issue here\u2014i.e., the contribution factor that the Com-\nmission had established for the first quarter of 2022\u2014\n\u201cmight be moot\u201d because sovereign immunity might \npreclude recovery of money already paid into the Uni-\nversal Service Fund.  Id. at 13a.  The court held, how-\never, that the case \u201cis nonetheless justiciable because it \nis capable of repetition yet evading review.\u201d  Ibid.  The \ncourt then rejected the argument that, because the \nCommission had prevailed against respondents in par-\n\n8 \n \nallel cases in the Sixth and Eleventh Circuits, principles \nof issue preclusion prohibited respondents from reliti-\ngating their nondelegation challenges in the Fifth Cir-\ncuit.  See id. at 14a-18a.  The court concluded that the \nFCC had forfeited that defense by raising it only after \nthis Court\u2019s denials of certiorari in the Sixth and Elev-\nenth Circuit cases, rather than immediately after the \nSixth and Eleventh Circuits\u2019 judgments.  See id. at 18a.  \nOn the merits, the en banc court stated that \u201cCon-\ngress through [Section] 254 may have delegated legis-\nlative power to FCC because it purported to confer \nupon FCC the power to tax without supplying an intel-\nligible principle to guide FCC\u2019s discretion.\u201d  App., infra, \n19a.  The court characterized Section 254\u2019s limits on the \nCommission\u2019s authority as \u201cminimal,\u201d \u201ccontentless,\u201d \u201ca \nhollow shell,\u201d and \u201cso amorphous that no reviewing \ncourt could ever possibly invalidate any FCC action.\u201d  \nId. at 27a, 29a, 41a.  The court found those nondelega-\ntion concerns to be \u201cespecially salient\u201d because Section \n254 \u201cimplicates the taxing power\u201d\u2014a \u201cquintessentially \nlegislative\u201d power.  Id. at 19a, 41a n.13. \nThe en banc court then stated that the FCC \u201cmay \nhave impermissibly delegated the taxing power to pri-\nvate entities.\u201d  App., infra, 19a.  The court concluded \nthat the Company\u2019s projections could \u201ctake legal effect \nwithout formal FCC approval.\u201d  Id. at 49a.  The court \nalso expressed the view that, as a practical matter, the \nCommission \u201c\u200a\u2018rubber stamp[s]\u2019 whatever contribution \namount [the Company] proposes.\u201d  Id. at 50a (citation \nomitted).  Finally, the court stated that Section 254 does \nnot authorize the FCC to delegate power to the Com-\npany in the first place.  See id. at 55a.  \nAlthough the en banc court was \u201chighly skeptical\u201d of \nthe constitutionality of Congress\u2019s grant of power to the \n\n9 \n \nCommission, and of the Commission\u2019s delegation of ad-\nministrative responsibilities to the Company, the court \ndid not decide whether either conferral of authority \nstanding alone would violate the Constitution.  See \nApp., infra, 64a.  The court instead held that \u201cthe com-\nbination of Congress\u2019s sweeping delegation to FCC and \nFCC\u2019s unauthorized subdelegation to [the Company] vi-\nolates the Legislative Vesting Clause.\u201d  Ibid.  In the \ncourt\u2019s view, the \u201cdouble-layered delegation\u201d at issue in \nthis case constituted \u201ca historical anomaly\u201d and under-\nmined \u201cdemocratic accountability.\u201d  Id. at 73a-74a.   \nJudge Elrod, joined by two other judges, issued a \nconcurring opinion in which she concluded that \u201cCon-\ngress\u2019s delegation of legislative power to the FCC and \nthe FCC\u2019s delegation of the taxing power to a private \nentity each individually contravene[s] the separation of \npowers.\u201d  App., infra, 82a.  Judge Ho issued a concur-\nring opinion in which he emphasized that \u201call legislative \npowers\u201d are \u201cexercised by the people we elect.\u201d  Id. at \n85a.    \nJudge Stewart, joined by six judges, dissented.  See \nApp., infra, 88a-114a.  He expressed the view that Sec-\ntion 254 \u201cevinces a clear intelligible principle delimiting \nagency discretion\u201d; that the en banc court of appeals\u2019 \nanalysis reflected an \u201cexaggerated conception of [the \nCompany\u2019s] role and discretion\u201d; and that \u201cdelegations \nof the taxing power are not subject to stricter scrutiny.\u201d  \nId. at 97a, 103a-104a.  Judge Higginson, joined by four \njudges, also dissented.  See id. at 115a-124a.  He criti-\ncized the court\u2019s \u201c\u200a\u2018combination\u2019 theory\u201d as inconsistent \nwith this Court\u2019s precedents.  Id. at 116a.   \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \nUniversal service has been an essential component \nof federal telecommunications policy ever since the \n\n10 \n \nFCC was established in 1934.  Today, universal service \nprograms ensure the availability of vital telecommuni-\ncations services to schools, libraries, rural health care \nproviders, and rural and low-income customers. \nIn the decision below, however, the en banc Fifth \nCircuit held that the universal service contribution sys-\ntem violates the nondelegation doctrine.  That decision \nconflicts with decisions of the Sixth and Eleventh Cir-\ncuits, which have rejected similar nondelegation chal-\nlenges.  It also invalidates the system that the Commis-\nsion has used for a quarter century to implement an im-\nportant Act of Congress.  If left in place, the decision \nwill upend the universal service programs, to the detri-\nment of millions of consumers nationwide.  This Court \nshould grant the petition for a writ of certiorari and re-\nverse. \nA. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s Decision Is Incorrect \nThe en banc Fifth Circuit erred in concluding that \n\u201cthe combination\u201d of Congress\u2019s delegation of power to \nthe Commission and the Commission\u2019s delegation of ad-\nministrative responsibilities to the Administrator vio-\nlates the Constitution.  App., infra, 19a.  Congress did \nnot delegate legislative power to the Commission.  The \nCommission did not delegate governmental power to \nthe Administrator.  Nor did the combination of those \ntwo conferrals of responsibility create a constitutional \nviolation.   \n1. Congress did not delegate legislative power to the \nCommission \nThe court of appeals concluded that Congress \u201cmay \nhave delegated legislative power\u201d to the FCC by em-\npowering the Commission to determine the amount of \n\n11 \n \nuniversal service contributions.  App., infra, 19a.  Sec-\ntion 254 does not effect any such delegation.   \na. Article I vests Congress with \u201c[a]ll legislative \nPowers\u201d granted by the Constitution.  U.S. Const. Art. \nI, \u00a7 1.  Congress may not delegate those legislative pow-\ners to the Executive Branch.  See A.L.A. Schechter \nPoultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495, 529 (1935).  \nBut Congress may authorize executive agencies to ex-\nercise substantial \u201cdiscretion\u201d in implementing and en-\nforcing the laws that Congress enacts.  J.W. Hampton, \nJr., & Co. v. United States, 276 U.S. 394, 406 (1928).   \nSo long as a statute sets forth an \u201cintelligible princi-\nple\u201d to guide the executive agency\u2019s actions, it effects a \nlawful grant of discretion rather than an unlawful dele-\ngation of legislative power.  See J.W. Hampton, 276 \nU.S. at 409.  A statute satisfies that requirement if it \nidentifies \u201cthe general policy, the public agency which \nis to apply it, and the boundaries of this delegated au-\nthority.\u201d  American Power & Light Co. v. SEC, 329 U.S. \n90, 105 (1946).  That test is \u201cnot demanding.\u201d  Gundy v. \nUnited States, 588 U.S. 128, 146 (2019) (plurality opin-\nion).  \u201cOnly twice in this country\u2019s history\u201d has the \nCourt held that a statute crossed that line\u2014\u201cin each \ncase because \u2018Congress had failed to articulate any pol-\nicy or standard\u2019 to confine discretion.\u201d  Ibid. (citation \nomitted).   \nBy contrast, this Court has \u201cover and over upheld \neven very broad delegations.\u201d  Gundy, 588 U.S. at 146 \n(plurality opinion).  The court has held, for example, \nthat Congress may empower agencies to regulate in the \n\u201cpublic interest,\u201d see National Broadcasting Co. v. \nUnited States, 319 U.S. 190, 225-226 (1943); to set \u201cfair \nand equitable\u201d prices, see Yakus v. United States, 321 \nU.S. 414, 422 (1944); or to establish air-quality stand-\n\n12 \n \nards that are \u201crequisite to protect the public health,\u201d \nsee Whitman v. American Trucking Ass\u2019ns, 531 U.S. \n457, 472-476 (2001). \nThe statute at issue here provides far more detailed \nguidance than others that this Court has upheld.  First, \nthe Act requires the Commission to \u201cbase policies for \nthe preservation and advancement of universal service\u201d \non six specific \u201cprinciples,\u201d 47 U.S.C. 254(b):  \n\u2022 \u201cQuality services should be available at just, reason-\nable, and affordable rates.\u201d  47 U.S.C. 254(b)(1). \n\u2022 \u201cAccess to advanced telecommunications and infor-\nmation services should be provided in all regions of \nthe Nation.\u201d  47 U.S.C. 254(b)(2).  \n\u2022 \u201cConsumers in all regions of the Nation  * * *  should \nhave access to telecommunications and information \nservices  * * *  that are reasonably comparable to \nthose services provided in urban areas and that are \navailable at rates that are reasonably comparable to \nthe rates charged for similar services in urban ar-\neas.\u201d  47 U.S.C. 254(b)(3).  \n\u2022 \u201cAll providers of telecommunications services should \nmake an equitable and nondiscriminatory contribu-\ntion to the preservation and advancement of univer-\nsal service.\u201d  47 U.S.C. 254(b)(4).  \n\u2022 \u201cThere should be specific, predictable and sufficient \nFederal and State mechanisms to preserve and ad-\nvance universal service.\u201d  47 U.S.C. 254(b)(5). \n\u2022 \u201cElementary and secondary schools and classrooms, \nhealth care providers, and libraries should have ac-\ncess to advanced telecommunications services.\u201d  47 \nU.S.C. 254(b)(6). \n\n13 \n \nSection 254(b) allows the FCC to \u201cbalance the principles \nagainst one another when they conflict.\u201d  Qwest Corp. v. \nFCC, 258 F.3d 1191, 1200 (10th Cir. 2001) (Qwest I).  But \nthe Commission \u201cmay not depart from them altogether \nto achieve some other goal.\u201d  Ibid.; see Qwest Commu-\nnications International, Inc. v. FCC, 398 F.3d 1222, \n1234 (10th Cir. 2005) (Qwest II).  \nSecond, the Act specifies the entities that must pay \nuniversal service contributions and the terms on which \nthey must do so.  See 47 U.S.C. 254(d).  \u201cEvery telecom-\nmunications carrier that provides interstate telecom-\nmunications services\u201d must contribute toward universal \nservice.  Ibid.  Those contributions must be \u201cequitable \nand nondiscriminatory.\u201d  Ibid. \nThird, the Act specifies the types of services that the \nFCC may fund.  See 47 U.S.C. 254(c).  Generally, only \n\u201ctelecommunications services\u201d may receive universal \nservice support.  47 U.S.C. 254(c)(1); see 47 U.S.C. \n153(53) (defining \u201ctelecommunications service\u201d).  And \nin determining which telecommunications services to \nfund, the Commission must consider the extent to which \nsuch services \u201care essential to education, public health, \nor public safety\u201d; have \u201cbeen subscribed to by a sub-\nstantial majority of residential customers\u201d; \u201care being \ndeployed in public telecommunications networks by tel-\necommunications carriers\u201d; and \u201care consistent with \nthe public interest, convenience, and necessity.\u201d  47 \nU.S.C. 254(c)(1).   \nFourth, the Act identifies the beneficiaries that may \nreceive subsidies and the ways in which the subsidies \nmay be used.  See 47 U.S.C. 254(e) and (h).  \u201c[O]nly an \neligible telecommunications carrier designated under \n[47 U.S.C. 214(e)] shall be eligible to receive specific \nFederal universal service support.\u201d  47 U.S.C. 254(e); \n\n14 \n \nsee 47 U.S.C. 214(e) (specifying criteria for designating \ntelecommunications carriers eligible to receive univer-\nsal service funding).  A carrier may use the funds \u201conly \nfor the provision, maintenance, and upgrading of facili-\nties and services for which the support is intended.\u201d  47 \nU.S.C. 254(e).  The Act also includes detailed provisions \ngoverning subsidies for rural healthcare providers, \nschools, and libraries.  See 47 U.S.C. 254(h).   \nFinally, the Act requires universal service support to \nbe \u201csufficient to achieve the purposes\u201d of Section 254,  \n47 U.S.C. 254(e), and specifies that services should be \n\u201caffordable,\u201d 47 U.S.C. 254(b)(1).  Those provisions con-\nstrain the program\u2019s overall size and budget.  The suffi-\nciency requirement precludes the Commission from ex-\npanding the program beyond \u201cwhat is \u2018sufficient to \nachieve the purposes of\u200a\u2019 universal service.\u201d  Consumers\u2019 \nResearch v. FCC, 67 F.4th 773, 794 (6th Cir. 2023) (cita-\ntion omitted), cert. denied, 144 S. Ct. 2628 (2024); see \nAlenco Communications, Inc. v. FCC, 201 F.3d 608, 620 \n(5th Cir. 2000) (\u201c[E]xcessive funding may itself violate \nthe sufficiency requirements of the Act.\u201d).  And the af-\nfordability principle precludes the FCC from allowing \nthe universal service contribution to become \u201cso large it \nactually makes telecommunications services less \u2018af-\nfordable.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Rural Cellular Ass\u2019n v. FCC, 588 F.3d 1095, \n1103 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (citation omitted); see Alenco, 201 \nF.3d at 620 (\u201cBecause universal service is funded by a \ngeneral pool subsidized by all telecommunications provid-\ners \u2014and thus indirectly by the customers\u2014excess sub-\nsidization in some cases may detract from universal ser-\nvice by causing rates unnecessarily to rise, thereby \npricing some consumers out of the market.\u201d). \nThe Act, in short, provides comprehensive guidance \nto the FCC on how to implement Congress\u2019s universal \n\n15 \n \nservice policy.  It sets out \u201cfrom whom funds are ex-\nacted,\u201d \u201cwho receives the benefit of the funds,\u201d and \u201cwhat \nminimum standards of service must be provided.\u201d  App., \ninfra, 93a (Stewart, J., dissenting).  The Act therefore \neffects a permissible grant of discretionary authority, \nnot an impermissible delegation of legislative power.  \nb. The court of appeals nonetheless concluded that \nSection 254 provides the Commission with \u201cno guidance \nwhatsoever.\u201d  App., infra, 30a (citation and emphasis \nomitted).  The court\u2019s stated bases for that conclusion \nlack merit.  \nThe court of appeals first stated that the FCC is au-\nthorized to use contributions \u201cto fund whatever projects \nit might like.\u201d  App., infra, 27a-28a.  That is incorrect.  \nThe Act defines \u201cuniversal service\u201d as a \u201clevel of tele-\ncommunications services\u201d established by the Commis-\nsion.  47 U.S.C. 254(c)(1).  The Commission accordingly \nmay use the Fund only for telecommunications services \n\u2014not for foreign aid, veterans\u2019 benefits, highway mainte-\nnance, or other \u201cprojects\u201d that the government \u201cmight \nlike.\u201d  App., infra, 28a.  Further constraining the FCC, \nthe Act lists factors that the FCC must consider in de-\nciding which telecommunications services to fund.  See \n47 U.S.C. 254(c)(1). \nThe court of appeals also stated that the Act\u2019s stand-\nards are \u201camorphous\u201d; that they leave the Commission \n\u201cat sea\u201d; and that \u201cno reviewing court could ever possi-\nbly invalidate any FCC action\u201d under those standards.  \nApp., infra, 27a, 31a, 41a.  But the Act constrains the \nFCC\u2019s implementation of universal service programs \nmore than the en banc court suggested.  Although the \ncourt viewed the Act as imposing no judicially enforce-\nable limits on the Commission\u2019s authority, \u201creviewing \ncourt[s],\u201d including the Fifth Circuit itself, previously \n\n16 \n \nhave \u201cinvalidate[d] FCC action\u201d when the Commission \nhas deviated from the statutory principles.  Id. at 41a; \nsee, e.g., Qwest II, 398 F.3d at 1232-1238; Qwest I, 258 \nF.3d at 1199-1200; Texas Office of Public Utility Coun-\nsel v. FCC, 183 F.3d 393, 406 (5th Cir. 1999).  And while \nthe Act\u2019s standards do not take the form of bright-line \nrules, the nondelegation doctrine does not require Con-\ngress to adopt a \u201cdeterminate criterion,\u201d American \nTrucking Ass\u2019ns, 531 U.S. at 475 (citation omitted), or \n\u201ca specific formula,\u201d Lichter v. United States, 334 U.S. \n742, 785 (1948). \nThe court of appeals emphasized that Section 254 au-\nthorizes the FCC to adopt additional universal service \nprinciples beyond those listed in the Act.  See App., in-\nfra, 28a.  But the Commission\u2019s power to adopt such \nprinciples is itself constrained by an intelligible stand-\nard:  the additional principles must be \u201cnecessary and \nappropriate for the protection of the public interest, \nconvenience, and necessity,\u201d and must be \u201cconsistent \nwith\u201d the Act.  47 U.S.C. 254(b)(7).  And in any event, \nthis case presents no question concerning the scope of \nthat authority, since the specific FCC order that re-\nspondents challenge does not adopt any such additional \nprinciples.  \nc. The court of appeals stated that \u201cthe scope of per-\nmissible delegation varies with context,\u201d and it cited \nvarious factors that, in its view, distinguished Section \n254 from other delegations that this Court has upheld.  \nApp., infra, 33a.  Those arguments, too, lack merit.  \nThe court of appeals found it \u201cespecially salient\u201d that \nSection 254 \u201cimplicates the taxing power.\u201d  App., infra, \n41a n.13.  But Congress did not need to rely on its taxing \npower to enact Section 254.  The Constitution empowers \nCongress to regulate \u201cCommerce\u201d \u201camong the several \n\n17 \n \nStates.\u201d  U.S. Const. Art. I, \u00a7 8, Cl. 3.  The commerce \npower includes the authority to regulate the channels \nand instrumentalities of interstate commerce, see \nPierce County v. Guillen, 537 U.S. 129, 147 (2003), such \nas telecommunications networks, see Pensacola Tele-\ngraph Co. v. Western Union Telegraph Co., 96 U.S. 1, 9 \n(1877).  And Congress may regulate commerce by re-\nquiring those engaged in commerce to pay money.  See \nGibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 202 (1824) (\u201c[D]uties may \noften be, and in fact often are, imposed on tonnage, with \na view to the regulation of commerce.\u201d).  The commerce \npower therefore provides an independently sufficient \nbasis for Section 254\u2019s requirement that carriers pay \nuniversal service contributions. \nIn any event, this Court has specifically rejected \u201cthe \napplication of a different and stricter nondelegation \nstandard in cases where Congress delegates discretion-\nary authority to the Executive under its taxing power.\u201d  \nSkinner v. Mid-America Pipeline Co., 490 U.S. 212, \n222-223 (1989).  The Constitution\u2019s text does not \u201cdistin-\nguish Congress\u2019 power to tax from its other enumerated \npowers  * * *  in terms of the scope and degree of dis-\ncretionary authority that Congress may delegate to the \nExecutive.\u201d  Id. at 220-221.  \u201cFrom its earliest days to \nthe present,\u201d Congress \u201chas varied the degree  * * *  of \ndiscretionary authority delegated to the Executive\u201d in \ntax statutes.  Id. at 221.  And the Court has repeatedly \napplied ordinary nondelegation principles in reviewing \ntax laws.  See, e.g., Federal Energy Administration v. \nAlgonquin SNG, Inc., 426 U.S. 548, 558-560 (1976); J.W. \nHampton, 276 U.S. at 409.   \nThe court of appeals also found Section 254 \u201cespe-\ncially troubling because the statute insulates FCC from \nthe principal tool Congress has to control FCC\u2019s univer-\n\n18 \n \nsal service decisions\u2014the appropriations power.\u201d  App., \ninfra, 31a.  But Congress exercised the appropriations \npower in Section 254 itself by authorizing the FCC to \nuse the Fund for universal service programs.  Congress \nretains the authority to repeal that appropriation. The \ncourt of appeals noted that Section 254 operates \u201cout-\nside the [annual] appropriations process,\u201d id. at 32a, but \nthe Constitution does not require an annual appropria-\ntions process.  It allows Congress to make \u201cstanding ap-\npropriations,\u201d CFPB v. Community Financial Services \nAss\u2019n of America, Ltd., 601 U.S. 416, 436 (2024), and a \ncourt may not penalize Congress\u2019s exercise of that \npower by applying a stricter nondelegation standard. \nFinally, the court of appeals asserted that Section \n254 invites the Commission to make \u201cpolicy\u201d judgments \nrather than purely \u201ctechnical\u201d judgments.  App., infra, \n34a.  But a \u201ccertain degree of discretion,\u201d and thus of \npolicymaking, \u201cinheres in most executive\u201d action.  \nAmerican Trucking Ass\u2019ns, 531 U.S. at 475 (citation \nomitted).  This Court has accordingly rejected the argu-\nment that the nondelegation doctrine precludes Con-\ngress from vesting executive agencies with authority to \nmake policy judgments.  See, e.g., Yakus, 321 U.S. at \n425-426 (\u201cIt is no objection that the [statute]  * * *  \ncall[s] for the exercise of judgment, and for the formu-\nlation of subsidiary administrative policy within the \nprescribed statutory framework.\u201d).  And the Court has \n\u201calmost never felt qualified to second-guess Congress \nregarding the permissible degree of policy judgment \nthat can be left to those executing or applying the law.\u201d  \nAmerican Trucking Ass\u2019ns, 531 U.S. at 474-475 (cita-\ntion omitted). \n\n19 \n \n2. The Commission did not delegate governmental \npower to the Administrator \nThe court of appeals separately determined that the \nFCC \u201cmay have\u201d unlawfully \u201csubdelegat[ed]\u201d legisla-\ntive power to the Administrator, a private corporation.  \nApp., infra, 19a.  But the court\u2019s analysis reflected an \n\u201cexaggerated conception of [the Administrator\u2019s] role \nand discretion.\u201d  Id. at 103a (Stewart, J., dissenting).  \na. In Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U.S. 238 (1936), \nthis Court explained that the Constitution prohibits the \nfederal government from transferring unchecked gov-\nernmental power to a private entity.  The statute at is-\nsue in that case allowed producers of two-thirds of the \ncoal in a particular district to set wages and hours for \nall producers in that district, without review by any fed-\neral agency.  See id. at 281-283.  The Court held that the \nstatute violated the Constitution by delegating to \u201cpri-\nvate persons\u201d the unchecked \u201cpower to regulate the af-\nfairs of an unwilling minority.\u201d  Id. at 311.  \nIn Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v. Adkins, 310 U.S. \n381 (1940), however, this Court clarified that the federal \ngovernment may rely on private entities to assist it in \nthe performance of its functions.  The statute at issue in \nthat case authorized local boards consisting of private \ncoal producers to propose minimum prices for coal, but \nempowered the National Bituminous Coal Commission \n(a governmental body) to approve, disapprove, or mod-\nify those prices.  See id. at 388.  The Court upheld the \nscheme because the private boards \u201cfunction[ed] subor-\ndinately\u201d to a federal agency.  Id. at 399.  The Court \nemphasized that the agency, not the boards, ultimately \n\u201cdetermine[d] the prices\u201d and that the agency \u201cha[d] \nauthority and surveillance over the [private boards\u2019] ac-\ntivities.\u201d  Ibid.  \n\n20 \n \nHere, as in Sunshine Anthracite, the relevant non-\ngovernmental actor \u201cfunction[s] subordinately to the\u201d \nresponsible federal agency and is subject to the agency\u2019s \n\u201cauthority and surveillance.\u201d  Sunshine Anthracite,  \n310 U.S. at 399.  The FCC, not the Administrator, de-\ntermines, within the limits set by Congress, how much \ncarriers must pay.  Under the FCC\u2019s rules, the amount \nof a carrier\u2019s contribution depends \u201con a contribution \nfactor determined quarterly by the Commission.\u201d   \n47 C.F.R. 54.709(a) (emphasis added).  The Administra-\ntor simply helps the Commission compute the contribu-\ntion factor by providing \u201cprojections\u201d of the universal \nservice programs\u2019 expenses and the carriers\u2019 revenues.  \n47 C.F.R. 54.709(a)(3). \nIn making the required projections, the Administra-\ntor must act in accordance with the Commission\u2019s rules.  \nThose rules establish detailed eligibility requirements \nfor universal service beneficiaries, see, e.g., 47 C.F.R. \n54.410; impose caps on particular types of support, see, \ne.g., 47 C.F.R. 54.507; and prescribe precise formulas \nfor calculating the amount of the subsidy, see, e.g., 47 \nC.F.R. 54.604-54.606.  Those rules also require the Ad-\nministrator to project total carrier revenues based on \nthe information contained in forms that the carriers file \neach quarter.  See 47 C.F.R. 54.709(a)(2), 54.711(a).  The \nspecificity of those rules ensures that, in making the \nprojections, the Administrator performs a ministerial \ntask.  \nThe FCC may exercise additional powers of supervi-\nsion after the Administrator makes its projections for a \nparticular quarter.  Projections of program expenses \n\u201cmust be approved by the Commission before they are \nused to calculate the quarterly contribution factor.\u201d  47 \nC.F.R. 54.709(a)(3).  To that end, the Administrator \n\n21 \n \nmust submit projections of the programs\u2019 expenses at \nleast 60 days before the start of the quarter.  See ibid.  \nIt must also submit \u201cthe basis for those projections.\u201d  \nIbid.  Those rules enable the Commission and its staff \nto review (and if necessary revise) the projections be-\nfore using them to calculate the contribution factor.   \nThe Commission then uses those projections to com-\npute a quarterly contribution factor, which it announces \nin a public notice and on its website.  See 47 C.F.R. \n54.709(a)(3).  The Commission \u201creserves the right\u201d to \nrevise the factor within the 14-day period following the \nissuance of the public notice.  Ibid.  Only if the FCC fails \nto take further action during that 14-day period is the \nfactor \u201cdeemed approved.\u201d  Ibid.  The Administrator \nmust then \u201ccalculate the amount of individual contribu-\ntions\u201d by \u201capply[ing] the quarterly contribution factor\u201d \nto each individual carrier\u2019s revenues.  Ibid.   \nFurther limiting the Administrator\u2019s role, a carrier \nthat is aggrieved by the Administrator\u2019s actions may \nseek de novo review before the Commission.  See 47 \nC.F.R. 54.719(b).  The FCC\u2019s rules provide, moreover, \nthat the Administrator \u201cmay not make policy, interpret \nunclear provisions of the statute or rules, or interpret \nthe intent of Congress.\u201d  47 C.F.R. 54.702(c).  If the stat-\nute or the rules \u201care unclear, or do not address a partic-\nular situation, the Administrator shall seek guidance \nfrom the Commission.\u201d  Ibid.  Thus, if the Administra-\ntor confronts an unsettled legal or policy issue in the \ncourse of calculating projections (or taking any other \naction), it must seek guidance from the FCC rather than \nresolving the issue itself.  \nThe Administrator, in short, performs an advisory \nrole; it has no independent substantive power to set the \ncontribution factor or the amount of individual carriers\u2019 \n\n22 \n \ncontributions.  In performing that role under the FCC\u2019s \n\u201cauthority and surveillance,\u201d Sunshine Anthracite, 310 \nU.S. at 399, the Administrator does not exercise govern-\nmental power. \nb. The court of appeals nevertheless concluded that \nthe Commission \u201cmay have impermissibly delegated \nthe taxing power\u201d to the Administrator.  App., infra, \n19a.  The court\u2019s analysis was flawed.  \nThe court of appeals stated that, under the FCC\u2019s \nrules, the Administrator\u2019s \u201cprojections take legal effect \nwithout formal FCC approval\u201d if the Commission takes \nno further action within 14 days after announcing the \ncontribution factor.  App., infra, 49a.  But the projec-\ntions have no independent legal effect.  Only the contri-\nbution factor has legal effect, and it is \u201cdetermined by \nthe Commission.\u201d  47 C.F.R. 54.709(a)(2).  The projec-\ntions, in any event, \u201cmust be approved by the Commis-\nsion before they are used to calculate the quarterly con-\ntribution factor.\u201d  47 C.F.R. 54.709(a)(3).  And the Com-\nmission may review the Administrator\u2019s projections not \nonly during the 14-day period after the FCC announces \nthe contribution factor, but also before announcing the \nfactor in the first place.  See pp. 20-21, supra.  \nThe court of appeals also asserted that the Commis-\nsion \u201crubber stamp[s]\u201d the Administrator\u2019s projections, \nso that the FCC exercises only \u201cde jure\u201d rather than \u201cde \nfacto\u201d control.  App., infra, 7a.  That claim is both le-\ngally irrelevant and factually incorrect.  As a legal mat-\nter, the relevant question is whether the Commission \nhas the \u201cauthority\u201d to reject or modify the Administra-\ntor\u2019s proposals, not how often the Commission exercises \nthat power in practice.  Sunshine Anthracite, 310 U.S. \nat 399; cf. United States v. Arthrex, Inc., 594 U.S. 1, 27 \n(2021) (plurality opinion) (\u201c[A principal officer] need not \n\n23 \n \nreview every decision of the [inferior officer].  What \nmatters is that the [principal officer] have the discretion \nto review decisions rendered by [inferior officers].\u201d).  \nThe court of appeals did not deny that the FCC retains \nplenary authority to review and revise the projections.  \nAs a factual matter, moreover, the FCC does conduct \nmeaningful review of the Administrator\u2019s actions.  On \nseveral occasions, including twice in 2023, the Commis-\nsion has departed from the Administrator\u2019s projections \nwhen calculating the quarterly contribution factor.  See, \ne.g., FCC, Proposed Fourth Quarter 2023 Universal Ser-\nvice Contribution Factor, DA 23-843, 2023 WL 6036327, \nat *1 (released Sept. 13, 2023); FCC, Proposed Third \nQuarter 2023 Universal Service Contribution Factor, \nDA 23-507, 2023 WL 4012359, at *1 (released June 14, \n2023); FCC, Revised Second Quarter 2003 Universal \nService Contribution Factor, 18 FCC Rcd 5097, 5097 \n(released Mar. 21, 2003).  The Commission also has \nawarded relief when it has disagreed with the Adminis-\ntrator\u2019s calculation of the contributions owed by individ-\nual carriers.  See, e.g., In re Universal Service Contri-\nbution Methodology, 31 FCC Rcd 13,220, 13,220 (2016).  \nThe relative infrequency with which the FCC revises \nthe Administrator\u2019s decisions reflects the Administra-\ntor\u2019s limited role, the detailed regulations constraining \nits actions, and the Commission\u2019s general oversight of \nits activities.  See App., infra, 121a (Higginson, J., dis-\nsenting).  \nThe court of appeals cited previous instances of \nfraud in the program.  See App., infra, 8a.  But FCC \nrules require the Administrator to undergo annual au-\ndits to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse.  See 47 C.F.R. \n54.717.  The Commission also regularly directs the Ad-\nministrator to take corrective action to recover improper \n\n24 \n \npayments made in the past and eliminate such payments \nin the future.  See, e.g., Letter from Mark Stephens, Man-\naging Dir., FCC, to Radha Sekar, CEO, USAC (Jan. 14, \n2021), https://www.fcc.gov/sites/default/files/fcc-letter-\nto-usac-01142021.pdf.  More fundamentally, although \npast instances of waste and fraud are \u201cconcerning,\u201d \n\u201cthis has never been enough to declare a coequal politi-\ncal branch\u2019s act unconstitutional.\u201d  App., infra, 122a \n(Higginson, J., dissenting).  \nFinally, the court of appeals stated that Section 254 \n\u201cdoes not authorize\u201d the Commission to delegate power \nto the Administrator.  App., infra, 55a.  But as the court \nacknowledged, respondents have not challenged the \nAdministrator\u2019s role on statutory grounds.  See id. at \n63a n.21.  In any event, for the reasons discussed above, \nthe FCC did not delegate governmental power to the \nAdministrator.  It assigned the Administrator a minis-\nterial task\u2014which the en banc court acknowledged is \npermissible.  See id. at 56a-57a.   \n3. The court of appeals\u2019 \u201ccombination\u201d theory is wrong \nAs explained above, the court of appeals was \u201chighly \nskeptical\u201d that the quarterly contribution factor at issue \nhere comports with either \u201cthe bar on congressional \ndelegations of legislative power\u201d or \u201cthe general rule \nthat private entities may not wield governmental power.\u201d  \nApp., infra, 64a.  The court declined, however, to defin-\nitively \u201cresolve either question in this case.\u201d  Ibid.  The \ncourt instead held that \u201cthe combination\u201d of Congress\u2019s \n\u201cdelegation\u201d to the FCC and the FCC\u2019s \u201csubdelegation\u201d \nto the Administrator \u201cviolates the Legislative Vesting \nClause.\u201d  Ibid.   \nThe court of appeals\u2019 \u201ccombination\u201d theory conflicts \nwith this Court\u2019s decision in Sunshine Anthracite.  See \nApp., infra, 116a-117a (Higginson, J., dissenting).  In \n\n25 \n \nthat case, as discussed above, an agency set coal prices \nbased on proposals made by private coal producers.  See \np. 19, supra.  The challengers argued that the scheme \nviolated both the public nondelegation doctrine (by em-\npowering the agency to set prices) and the private non-\ndelegation doctrine (by allowing private entities to play \na role in the process by which those prices were deter-\nmined).  See Sunshine Anthracite, 310 U.S. at 397-399.  \nThis Court rejected the public nondelegation claim, ex-\nplaining that Congress had specified \u201cwholly adequate\u201d \n\u201ccriteria\u201d to guide the agency.  Id. at 398.  The Court \nthen rejected the private nondelegation claim, noting \nthat the agency had \u201cauthority and surveillance\u201d over \nthe private entities\u2019 activities.  Id. at 399.  The Court \n\u201cended its analysis of both delegation challenges there\u201d; \nit did not suggest that the combination of the two con-\nferrals of authority required a further analysis beyond \nthat needed to evaluate each challenge taken on its own.  \nApp., infra, 116a (Higginson, J., dissenting).  \nThe court of appeals drew an analogy to this Court\u2019s \nholding in Free Enterprise Fund v. PCAOB, 561 U.S. \n477 (2010), that Article II precludes Congress from \ngranting two layers of tenure protection to certain ex-\necutive officers.  See App., infra, 66a.  That analogy is \ninapt.  In Free Enterprise Fund, the Court emphasized \nthat a \u201csecond level of tenure protection\u201d \u201ctransforms\u201d \nan agency\u2019s independence by \u201cchang[ing] the nature of \nthe President\u2019s review.\u201d  561 U.S. at 496.  By contrast, \nthe supposed second level of delegation in this case\u2014\nthe FCC\u2019s reliance on the Administrator\u2019s non-binding \nprojections in computing the contribution factor\u2014has \nno such transformative effect.  The FCC still decides, \nwithin the bounds set by Congress, how much carriers \n\n26 \n \nmust pay; the Administrator simply provides data to as-\nsist the Commission in making that decision.  \nThe court of appeals\u2019 theory fails on its own terms \nanyway.  The court acknowledged that \u201c[t]here cannot \nbe a combined public/private delegation without a pri-\nvate delegation.\u201d  App., infra, 79a.  No private delega-\ntion exists here.  As discussed above, the Administrator \nmakes recommendations but exercises no independent \ngovernmental power in the quarterly process of setting \nthe contribution factor.  See pp. 19-24, supra. \nB. The Questions Presented Warrant This Court\u2019s Review \n1. The en banc Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision warrants this \nCourt\u2019s review because it creates a circuit conflict.  In \naddition to their present challenge, respondents also \nfiled petitions for review in the Sixth and Eleventh Cir-\ncuits to pursue nondelegation challenges to other FCC \norders setting quarterly contribution factors for differ-\nent time periods.  See Consumers\u2019 Research, 67 F.4th \nat 778 (6th Cir.); Consumers\u2019 Research v. FCC, 88 F.4th \n917, 921 (11th Cir. 2023), cert. denied, 144 S. Ct. 2629 \n(2024).  Unlike the Fifth Circuit, the Sixth and Eleventh \nCircuits rejected those challenges.   \nThe Sixth Circuit held that Section 254 \u201cdoes not vi-\nolate the nondelegation doctrine\u201d because the statute \n\u201ccontains an intelligible principle.\u201d  Consumers\u2019 Re-\nsearch, 67 F.4th at 797.  That court also held that \u201cthere \nis no private-nondelegation doctrine violation\u201d because \nthe Administrator is \u201csubordinat[e] to the FCC\u201d and \nprovides only \u201cministerial support.\u201d  Ibid.  The Elev-\nenth Circuit similarly concluded that \u201cthere are no un-\nconstitutional delegations under [Section 254] because \nCongress has laid out the principles the FCC must fol-\nlow.\u201d  Consumers\u2019 Research, 88 F.4th at 928.  It also \nconcluded that \u201cthere is no violation of the private non-\n\n27 \n \ndelegation doctrine\u201d because the Administrator \u201cis sub-\nordinate to the FCC\u201d and \u201cthe FCC retains ultimate de-\ncision-making power.\u201d  Ibid.  Neither the Sixth nor the \nEleventh Circuit suggested that the combination of the \ntwo nondelegation challenges required an additional \nanalysis beyond that needed to resolve the challenges \nseparately.  \nThe decision below also is in tension with the D.C. \nCircuit\u2019s decision in Rural Cellular Ass\u2019n v. FCC, 685 \nF.3d 1083 (2012).  In that case, the D.C. Circuit held that \nSection 254 does not unconstitutionally delegate legis-\nlative power to the Commission.  See id. at 1091-1092.  \nThe court explained that Section 254 \u201cclearly provides \nan intelligible principle to guide the Commission\u2019s ef-\nforts.\u201d  Id. at 1091.  That case did not, however, involve \nany challenge under the private nondelegation doctrine.  \n2. Even apart from the circuit conflict, the decision \nbelow warrants further review because it invalidates \nthe FCC\u2019s implementation of a federal statute.  Judging \nthe constitutionality of an Act of Congress is \u201cthe grav-\nest and most delicate duty\u201d that courts are called on to \nperform.  Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U.S. 142, 148 (1927) \n(opinion of Holmes, J.).  Accordingly, \u201cwhen a lower \ncourt has invalidated a federal statute,\u201d this Court\u2019s \n\u201cusual\u201d approach is to grant review.  Iancu v. Brunetti, \n588 U.S. 388, 392 (2019). \nAlthough the court of appeals stated that it was not \nholding Section 254 unconstitutional, see App., infra, \n19a, the court\u2019s analysis reflected its \u201cgrave concerns \nabout \u00a7 254\u2019s constitutionality,\u201d id. at 42a.  The court\u2019s \nview that Section 254 \u201cmay have delegated legislative \npower\u201d to the FCC was one of two conclusions that, in \n\u201ccombination,\u201d led the court to find a constitutional vio-\nlation.  Id. at 19a.  And while the court did not invalidate \n\n28 \n \nthe statute on its face, it did invalidate the way in which \nthe Commission has implemented the statute for more \nthan two decades (i.e., using the Administrator\u2019s projec-\ntions in setting the quarterly contribution factor).  The \nFifth Circuit\u2019s decision is therefore analogous to a deci-\nsion invalidating a federal statute as applied to particu-\nlar circumstances\u2014a type of decision that this Court \nroutinely reviews even in the absence of a circuit con-\nflict.  See, e.g., Vidal v. Elster, 602 U.S. 286, 292 (2024); \nAgency for International Development v. Alliance for \nOpen Society International, Inc., 591 U.S. 430, 433 \n(2020); DHS v. Thuraissigiam, 591 U.S. 103, 116 (2020).   \n3. The practical consequences of the decision below \nunderscore the need for this Court\u2019s review.  For more \nthan a quarter-century, the universal service programs \nhave made telephone service affordable for rural and \nlow-income consumers.  Those programs have sup-\nported the provision of essential services by rural health \ncare providers.  And they have facilitated internet ac-\ncess in schools and libraries across the Nation.  \nThe decision below, however, threatens to nullify the \nuniversal service programs\u2014to the detriment of the \u201cmil-\nlions of Americans\u201d whom those programs serve.  App., \ninfra, 123a (Higginson, J., dissenting).  If the Fifth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s decision is allowed to take effect, carriers in that \ncircuit (and perhaps elsewhere) are likely to argue that \nthey no longer have a legal obligation to make universal \nservice contributions because the FCC and the Admin-\nistrator lack the power to collect such payments.  Such \na development would devastate the FCC\u2019s ability to en-\nsure sufficient funding for universal service subsidies \ngoing forward.  \n4. This Court should grant certiorari on all three \nquestions presented: whether Congress impermissibly \n\n29 \n \ndelegated legislative power to the FCC, whether the \nCommission impermissibly delegated governmental \npower to the Administrator, and whether the combina-\ntion of the two alleged delegations violates the Consti-\ntution.  Although the court of appeals ultimately rested \nits decision on its resolution of the third issue, consider-\nation of the other two issues is a necessary \u201cpredicate \nto an intelligent resolution\u201d of the third question.  Helix \nEnergy Solutions Group, Inc. v. Hewitt, 598 U.S. 39, 50 \nn.3 (2023) (citation omitted).  It would make little sense \nto analyze the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \u201ccombination\u201d theory, \nApp., infra, 19a, without considering the components of \nthat combination.  Although the Court might ultimately \nresolve this case without answering all three questions, \ngranting review on all three would ensure that the \nCourt can fully consider all aspects of respondents\u2019 \nchallenge.   \nC. This Case Is An Appropriate Vehicle For Resolving The \nQuestions Presented \n1. The en banc court of appeals and the panel dis-\ncussed three threshold procedural issues.  But none of \nthose issues would prevent this Court from reaching the \nquestions presented.  \nFirst, the en banc court suggested sua sponte that \nthe case \u201cmight be moot\u201d because sovereign immunity \nmight preclude respondents from recovering money al-\nready paid into the Fund.  App., infra, 13a.  The court \ncorrectly held, however, that this case is \u201cnonetheless \njusticiable because it is capable of repetition yet evad-\ning review.\u201d  Ibid.  That exception to mootness applies \nwhere \u201c(1) the challenged action is in its duration too \nshort to be fully litigated prior to cessation or expira-\ntion, and (2) there is a reasonable expectation that the \nsame complaining party will be subject to the same ac-\n\n30 \n \ntion again.\u201d  Davis v. FEC, 554 U.S. 724, 735 (2008) (ci-\ntation omitted).  This case satisfies the first require-\nment because an FCC order setting the quarterly con-\ntribution factor lasts just one quarter.   See Kingdom-\nware Technologies, Inc. v. United States, 579 U.S. 162, \n170 (2016) (explaining that \u201ca period of two years\u201d is of-\nten \u201ctoo short to complete judicial review\u201d).  And this \ncase satisfies the second requirement because the Com-\nmission calculates a new contribution factor every quar-\nter.  See App., infra, 14a.  \nSecond, the FCC argued to the panel that respond-\nents\u2019 petition for review was untimely because \u201cany \nchallenge to \u00a7 254 should have come when Congress \noriginally enacted it.\u201d  App., infra, 128a.  The panel re-\njected that contention, see ibid., and the Commission \ndid not renew the argument at the en banc stage.  The \npanel\u2019s rejection of that argument was correct.  The ap-\nplicable judicial-review provision states that \u201c[a]ny \nparty aggrieved by the [agency\u2019s] final order may, \nwithin 60 days after its entry, file a petition to review \nthe order.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2344.  Respondents filed their pe-\ntition \u201cwithin 60 days after\u201d the \u201cfinal order\u201d\u2014i.e., the \nFCC order that established the applicable contribution \nfactor for the first quarter of 2022\u2014that respondents \nsought to challenge.  Ibid. \nFinally, the en banc court rejected the argument \nthat, under the doctrine of issue preclusion, the Sixth \nand Eleventh Circuits\u2019 decisions precluded respondents \nfrom relitigating their nondelegation claims in this case.  \nSee App., infra, 14a.  The court held that the govern-\nment had forfeited that argument by raising it after this \nCourt denied certiorari rather than immediately after \nthe Sixth and Eleventh Circuits issued their decisions.  \nSee ibid.  The government does not seek this Court\u2019s \n\n31 \n \nreview of that holding.  As the en banc court noted, if \nthe Fifth Circuit did not reach the merits here, it would \nstill need to decide them in a separate pending case \n\u201cthat includes petitioners who were not parties to the \nSixth or Eleventh Circuit proceedings.\u201d  Id. at 18a;  \nsee Pet. for Review, Consumers\u2019 Research v. FCC, No. \n24-60330 (5th Cir. Jun. 27, 2024).  And since issue pre-\nclusion does not concern subject-matter jurisdiction, \nsee Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Industries Corp., \n544 U.S. 280, 293 (2005), this Court would have no inde-\npendent obligation to address the issue.* \n2. After this Court denied the petitions for writs of \ncertiorari in the Sixth and Eleventh Circuit cases, the \nchallengers filed petitions for rehearing asking the \nCourt to reconsider those denials.  See Pet. for Reh\u2019g, \nConsumers\u2019 Research, supra (No. 23-456); Pet. for Reh\u2019g, \nConsumers\u2019 Research, supra (No. 23-743).  The Court \nhas not yet acted on those rehearing petitions.  In the \ngovernment\u2019s view, the best course would be to grant \ncertiorari in this case, rather than in one or both of \nthose cases.  Granting certiorari in this case would ena-\n \n*  Contrary to the Fifth Circuit\u2019s suggestion, the government did \nnot seek to \u201cevade\u201d this Court\u2019s review in its brief in opposition to \nthe petitions for writs of certiorari in the Sixth and Eleventh Circuit \ncases.  App., infra, 18a n.5.  In those petitions, which were filed be-\nfore the en banc court issued the decision below, the challengers as-\nserted that the en banc Fifth Circuit was \u201cpoised to create\u201d a circuit \nconflict.  Pet. at 34, Consumers\u2019 Research v. FCC, 144 S. Ct. 2628 \n(2024) (No. 23-456); Pet. at 38, Consumers\u2019 Research v. FCC, 144 S. \nCt. 2629 (2024) (No. 23-743).  The government simply responded \nthat \u201cthe en banc Fifth Circuit ha[d] not yet issued its decision\u201d and \nthat, \u201c[o]nce it does so, the parties can determine whether to seek, \nand this Court can determine whether to grant, certiorari to review \nthat decision.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Br. in Opp. at 17-18, Consumers\u2019 Research, \nsupra (No. 23-456). \n\n32 \n \nble this Court to directly review the reasoning of the \nonly court that has found a nondelegation violation in \nthe FCC\u2019s implementation of Section 254.  \nD. In The Alternative, The Court Should Hold This Peti-\ntion For A Writ Of Certiorari Pending The Court\u2019s Res-\nolution Of Wisconsin Bell  \nThis Court has granted review in Wisconsin Bell, \nInc. v. United States ex rel. Heath, No. 23-1127 (oral ar-\ngument scheduled for Nov. 4, 2024), in order to consider \nwhether a request for reimbursement under a universal \nservice program is a \u201cclaim\u201d governed by the False \nClaims Act, 31 U.S.C. 3721 et seq.  Congress defined  \nthe term \u201c\u200a\u2018claim\u2019\u200a\u201d to include requests for money pre-\nsented to an \u201cagent of the United States,\u201d 31 U.S.C. \n3729(b)(2)(A)(i), as well as certain requests for money if \nthe government \u201cprovides\u201d any portion of the funds re-\nquested, 31 U.S.C. 3729(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I).  This Court\u2019s \nresolution of those issues in Wisconsin Bell could shed \nlight on the nature of the FCC\u2019s relationship with the \nCompany\u2014which, in turn, could affect the nondelega-\ntion analysis in this case.  The challengers\u2019 rehearing \npetitions in the Sixth and Eleventh Circuit cases recog-\nnized Wisconsin Bell\u2019s relevance to the nondelegation \nissues raised here.  See Pet. for Reh\u2019g at 3, Consumers\u2019 \nResearch, supra (No. 23-456); Pet. for Reh\u2019g at 3, Con-\nsumers\u2019 Research, supra (No. 23-743).   \nIn the government\u2019s view, the best course would be \nto grant review in this case and to resolve the uncer-\ntainty created by the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision.  But if this \nCourt does not grant review in this case, it should hold \nthis petition for a writ of certiorari pending the Court\u2019s \nresolution of Wisconsin Bell.  \n\n33 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be \ngranted.  In the alternative, the petition should be held \npending this Court\u2019s resolution of Wisconsin Bell v. \nUnited States ex rel. Heath, No. 23-1127 (oral argument \nscheduled for Nov. 4, 2024), and then disposed of as ap-\npropriate.  \nRespectfully submitted. \nP. MICHELE ELLISON \nGeneral Counsel \nJACOB M.

OLDHAM, Circuit Judge, joined by JONES, \nSMITH, ELROD, WILLETT, HO, DUNCAN, ENGELHARDT, \nand WILSON, Circuit Judges: \nIn the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Congress \ndelegated its taxing power to the Federal Communica-\ntions Commission.  FCC then subdelegated the taxing \npower to a private corporation.  That private corpora-\ntion, in turn, relied on for-profit telecommunications \ncompanies to determine how much American citizens \nwould be forced to pay for the \u201cuniversal service\u201d tax \nthat appears on cell phone bills across the Nation.  We \nhold this misbegotten tax violates Article I, \u00a7 1 of the \nConstitution. \nI. \nA. \nCongress has long \u201cpursued a policy of providing \n\u2018universal\u2019 [telecommunications] service to all residents \nand businesses in the United States.\u201d  Ronald J. Kro-\ntoszynski, Jr., Reconsidering the Nondelegation Doc-\ntrine:  Universal Service, the Power to Tax, and the \nRatification Doctrine, 80 IND. L.J. 239, 279 (2005).  \nFor half a century Congress pursued this policy through \na complicated cross-subsidy regime.  Back when the \nold AT&T was a regulated monopoly, Congress allowed \nit to charge supra-competitive rates to urban customers \nin exchange for requiring it to provide services it might \nnot otherwise provide to high-cost rural customers.  \nBut \u201c[f\u200a]or obvious reasons, this system of implicit subsi-\ndies can work well only under regulated conditions.  In \na competitive environment, a carrier that tries to subsi-\ndize below-cost rates to rural customers with above-cost \nrates to urban customers is vulnerable to a competitor \n\n3a \n \nthat offers at-cost rates to urban customers.\u201d  Tex. Off. \nof Pub. Util. Couns. v. FCC (\u201cTOPUC I\u201d), 183 F.3d 393, \n406 (5th Cir. 1999).  So when Congress deregulated \nAT&T and other telecommunications companies, it had \nto abandon the old way of pursuing universal service. \nCongress\u2019s new way is 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254.  Section 254 \nauthorizes FCC to establish \u201cspecific, predictable, and \nsufficient  . . .  mechanisms to preserve and advance \nuniversal service.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 254(b)(5).  Pursuant to this \ngrant of authority, FCC levies \u201ccontributions\u201d to a Uni-\nversal Service Fund (\u201cUSF\u201d) from telecommunications \ncarriers, id. \u00a7 254(b)(4), and it distributes the monies \nraised to people, entities, and projects to expand and ad-\nvance telecommunications services.  FCC regulations \nexpressly permit carriers to pass these \u201ccontributions\u201d \nthrough to their customers, see 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.712(a), \nand the overwhelming majority of carriers do so, see \nFCC, FCC 22-67, Report on the Future of the Universal \nService Fund 10084-85, (Aug. 15, 2022) (\u201cReport to Con-\ngress\u201d). \nNotably, Congress declined to define \u201cuniversal ser-\nvice\u201d itself.  Instead, it delegated to FCC the responsi-\nbility to periodically \u201cestablish\u201d the concept of \u201cuniver-\nsal service\u201d by \u201ctaking into account advances in telecom-\nmunications and information technologies and services.\u201d  \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(c)(1).  In making this determination, \nCongress directed FCC to: \nconsider the extent to which such telecommunica-\ntions services\u2014 \n(A) are essential to education, public health, or \npublic safety; \n\n4a \n \n(B) have, through the operation of market choices \nby customers, been subscribed to by a sub-\nstantial majority of residential customers; \n(C) are being deployed in public telecommunica-\ntions networks by telecommunications carri-\ners; and \n(D) are consistent with the public interest, con-\nvenience, and necessity. \nId. \u00a7 254(c)(1). \nSection 254(b) also suggests principles for FCC to \n\u201cbase policies for the preservation and advancement of \nuniversal service.\u201d  Telecommunications services \u201cshould\u201d \nbe \u201cavailable at just, reasonable, and affordable rates\u201d; \naccessible \u201cin all regions of the Nation\u201d; and available to \n\u201clow-income consumers and those in rural, insular, and \nhigh cost areas\u201d at rates \u201creasonably comparable to \nrates charged for similar services in urban areas.\u201d  Id. \n\u00a7 254(b)(1)-(3).  FCC also may develop \u201csuch other \n[universal service principles it] determine[s] are neces-\nsary and appropriate for the protection of the public in-\nterest, convenience, and necessity and are consistent \nwith this chapter.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 254(b)(7). \nSection 254 further provides that \u201c[e]lementary and \nsecondary schools and classrooms, health care provid-\ners, and libraries should have access to advanced tele-\ncommunications services.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 254(b)(6).  Accord-\ningly, \u201ctelecommunications carrier[s] shall, upon receiv-\ning a bona fide request, provide telecommunications ser-\nvices which are necessary for the provision of health \ncare services in a State  . . .  to any public or non-\nprofit health care provider that serves persons who re-\nside in rural areas in that State at rates that are reason-\n\n5a \n \nably comparable to rates charged for similar services in \nurban areas in that State.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 254(h)(1)(A).  And \n\u201ctelecommunications carriers  . . .  shall, upon a bona \nfide request for any of its services that are within the \n[FCC\u2019s] definition of universal service  . . .  , provide \nsuch services to elementary schools, secondary schools, \nand libraries for educational purposes at rates less than \nthe amounts charged for similar services to other par-\nties.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 254(h)(1)(B).  FCC then reimburses telecom-\nmunications providers for the costs of providing this \nsubsidized service.  Id. \u00a7 254(h)(1)(A), (B)(i)-(ii). \nB. \nPresently, USF supports telecommunications pro-\njects through four major programs:  the High-Cost \nProgram (see 47 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 54.302-54.322), the Lifeline \nProgram (see id. \u00a7\u00a7 54.400-54.423), the E-rate Program \n(see id. \u00a7\u00a7 54.500-54.523), and the Rural Health Care \nProgram (see id. \u00a7\u00a7 54.600-54.633). \nEach program has a laudable objective.  The High-\nCost Program subsidizes the provision of voice and in-\nternet services in rural communities.  The Lifeline Pro-\ngram subsidizes the provision of phone service to low- \nincome consumers.  The E-Rate Program subsidizes \nthe provision of broadband connectivity and Wi-Fi to \nschools and libraries.  And the Rural Health Care Pro-\ngram subsidizes the provision of telecommunications \nservices to rural healthcare providers. \nFCC regulations establish the services supported by \neach of these programs and the eligibility criteria appli-\ncants must satisfy to obtain assistance.  But FCC does \nnot administer all these universal service programs it-\nself.  Instead, it relies on a private company called the \n\n6a \n \nUniversal Service Administrative Company (\u201cUSAC\u201d).  \nUSAC is managed by representatives from \u201cinterest \ngroups affected by and interested in universal service \nprograms\u201d who are \u201cnominated by their respective in-\nterest groups.\u201d  See Leadership, UNIVERSAL SERV. AD-\nMIN. CO., https://perma.cc/9W92G4Z9 (last accessed \nSept. 11, 2023); see also 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.703(b) (providing \nfor the composition of USAC\u2019s board of directors).  \nFCC has charged USAC with myriad tasks:  \u201cbilling \ncontributors, collecting contributions to the universal \nservice support mechanisms, and disbursing universal \nservice support funds.\u201d  47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.702(b). \nMost prominently, though, USAC is responsible for \ndeciding the quarterly USF contribution amount\u2014a \nprojection of the dollar value of demand for universal \nsupport programs and the costs of administering them. \nSee id. \u00a7 54.709(a)(3).  The contribution amount dic-\ntates the size of the universal service contributions lev-\nied on telecommunications carriers and, in turn, Ameri-\ncan telecommunications consumers.  To set the contri-\nbution amount, USAC relies on \u201cinformation from uni-\nversal service program participants\u201d to \u201cestimate[] how \nmuch money will be needed each quarter to provide uni-\nversal service support.\u201d  See Universal Service, UNIVER-\nSAL SERV. ADMIN. CO., https://perma.cc/B5NN-AVF8 \n(last accessed Oct. 10, 2023).  In other words, the con-\ntribution amount ultimately derives from the universal \nservice demand projections of private, for-profit tele-\ncommunications carriers, all of whom have \u201chave finan-\ncial incentives\u201d to increase the size of universal service \nprograms.  U.S. GOV\u2019T ACCOUNTABILITY OFF., GAO-\n17-538, ADDITIONAL ACTION NEEDED TO ADDRESS SIG-\nNIFICANT RISKS IN FCC\u2019S LIFELINE PROGRAM 1 (2017), \n\n7a \n \nhttps://perma.cc/K5J9-L89K (\u201cFCC\u2019s Lifeline Pro-\ngram\u201d). \nFCC then uses USAC\u2019s contribution amount to im-\npose a tax on America\u2019s telecommunications carriers. \n(FCC calls this tax the USF \u201ccontribution factor\u201d; but \nwe call it what it is\u2014the \u201cUSF Tax.\u201d)  The USF Tax is \nthe percentage of end-user telecommunications reve-\nnues each carrier must contribute to USF in a particular \nquarter.  As a practical matter, USAC sets the USF \nTax\u2014subject only to FCC\u2019s rubber stamp.  True,  \nFCC \u201creserves the right to set projections of demand \nand administrative expenses at amounts that [it] deter-\nmines will serve the public interest.\u201d  See 47 C.F.R.  \n\u00a7 54.709(a)(3).  But FCC never made a substantive re-\nvision to USAC\u2019s proposed contribution amount prior to \nthis litigation,1 and it does not even have a documented \nprocess for checking USAC\u2019s work.  Instead, FCC  \nhas provided that if it \u201ctake[s] no action within fourteen \n(14) days of the date of release of the public notice an-\nnouncing [USAC\u2019s] projections of demand and adminis-\ntrative expenses, the projections of demand and admin-\nistrative expenses  . . .  shall be deemed approved by \nthe Commission.\u201d  See ibid. (emphasis added).  So \nFCC has delegated to USAC responsibility\u2014de facto if \nnot de jure\u2014for imposing the USF Tax. \n \n \n \n1  FCC claims it has made three alterations to USF projections.  \nBut one of those was a ministerial change of the rate from .09044 \nto .091 because some carriers\u2019 computers could not handle five dec-\nimal places.  And the other two were not even initiated by FCC.  \nSee Petrs\u2019 EB Br. 63. \n\n8a \n \nC. \nIn 1995, the USF Tax was $1.37 billion.  JA62.  But \nby the end of 2021, USAC ballooned the USF to over $9 \nbillion.  See UNIVERSAL SERV. ADMIN. CO., 2021 An-\nnual Report 20 (2023) https://perma.cc/9CPT-H5LM.  \nThe proposed USF Tax at issue in this case is 25.2%, up \nfrom just over 5% in 2000.  See FCC, DA 00-517, PRO-\nPOSED SECOND QUARTER 2000 UNIVERSAL SERVICE \nCONTRIBUTION FACTOR (Mar. 7, 2000), https://perma. \ncc/4BSK-6QZR.  Recent USF Taxes have been set as \nhigh as 34.5%.  See FCC, DA 23-843, PROPOSED FOURTH \nQUARTER 2023 UNIVERSAL SERVICE CONTRIBUTION \nFACTOR (Sep. 13, 2023), https://perma.cc/Y2QW-6HBD. \nMany of the billions injected into the USF have un-\ndoubtedly been deployed to support the important goal \nof universal service.  But waste and fraud have also \ncontributed to the USF\u2019s astronomical growth.  For \nexample, in 2004, FCC\u2019s Inspector General affirmed \nthat schools view the E-Rate Program as \u201ca big candy \njar\u201d of \u201cfree money.\u201d  Sam Dillon, School Internet Pro-\ngram Lacks Oversight, Investigator Says, N.Y. Times \n(June 18, 2004), https://perma.cc/9PZY-ED3K.  The \nInspector General\u2019s primary concern was FCC\u2019s heavy \nand longstanding reliance on self-certified eligibility de-\nterminations in the E-rate Program.  See U.S. GOV\u2019T \nACCOUNTABILITY OFF., GAO-20-606, FCC SHOULD \nTAKE ACTION TO BETTER MANAGE PERSISTENT FRAUD \nRISKS IN THE SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES PROGRAM18 \n(Sep. 2020), https://perma.cc/5EK4-Q8V8 (\u201cFCC\u2019s E-\nrate Program\u201d).  A 2008 GAO report demonstrated \nthat, in a single year, USAC made almost a billion dol-\nlars of High-Cost Program payments that \u201cshould not \nhave been made, or were not made, in the correct \n\n9a \n \namount, when viewed from the perspective of applicable \nFederal Communications Commission rules, orders and \ninterpretative opinions.\u201d  OFF. OF THE INSPECTOR \nGEN., FCC, THE HIGH COST PROGRAM 2 (Nov. 26, 2008), \nhttps:// perma.cc/WJG3-6PJ6 (\u201cThe High-Cost Pro-\ngram\u201d).  In 2013, one Congressman noted: \nThe [Lifeline] fund [] increased 266 percent [between \n2008 and 2013],  . . .  all while the cost of phone \nservice [went] down.  Despite the limit of one subsi-\ndized subscriber per household, published reports \nsuggest some subscribers have eight or more phones \nwith subsidized service, with one woman saying that \nto get one \u201cshe just goes across the street and gets \nit.\u201d  One man has claimed to have a bag full of 20 \nphones on the program that he sells \u201cfor about 10, 15, \n20 bucks\u201d each. \nThe Lifeline Fund:  Money Well Spent?:  Hearing \nBefore the H.

And in 2018, FCC\u2019s \nmanaging director reported a GAO audit that uncovered \ngross improper payments of $336.39 million in the Life-\nline Program alone.  See Letter from Mark Stephens, \nManaging Director, FCC, to Ron Johnson, Chairman, S. \nComm. On Homeland Sec. & Gov\u2019t Affs. (Aug. 27, 2019), \nhttps:// perma.cc/VNQ6-N3WB.  While earth\u2019s only \ntwo certainties are death and taxes, the USF Tax man-\nages to cheat the grave:  It is well-documented that \nFCC disburses USF money to dead people.  See FCC\u2019s \nLIFELINE PROGRAM, supra, at 43. \nUSAC\u2019s role in perpetuating USF waste is equally \nwell known.  In 2010, GAO concluded that USAC \u201clacks \n\n10a \n \nkey features of effective internal controls.\u201d  U.S. GOV\u2019T \nACCOUNTABILITY OFF., GAO-11-11, IMPROVED MAN-\nAGEMENT CAN ENHANCE FCC DECISION MAKING FOR \nTHE UNIVERSAL SERVICE FUND LOW-INCOME PRO-\nGRAM i (Oct. 2010), https://perma.cc/9YHE-8YE9 \n(\u201cFCC\u2019s Low-Income Program\u201d); see also FCC\u2019s E-\nRATE PROGRAM, supra, at 20-21.  The Low-Income \nProgram report noted that while USAC primarily uses \naudit findings to monitor compliance with USF rules, \n\u201cthe number and scope of USAC\u2019s audits have been lim-\nited and there is no systematic process in place to review \nthe findings of those audits that are conducted.\u201d  \nFCC\u2019s LOW-INCOME PROGRAM, supra, at cover page.  \nMoreover, the GAO noted USAC had not even consid-\nered \u201cthe possibility that multiple carriers may claim \nsupport for the same telephone line and that households \nmay receive more than one discount, contrary to pro-\ngram rules.\u201d  Ibid.  In 2017, GAO explained that \nUSAC \u201crelies on over 2,000 Eligible Telecommunication \nCarriers that are Lifeline providers to implement key \nprogram functions, such as verifying subscriber eligibil-\nity,\u201d which is problematic because \u201ccompanies may have \nfinancial incentives to enroll as many customers as pos-\nsible.\u201d  FCC\u2019s LIFELINE PROGRAM, supra, at cover page.  \nAnd in 2019, FCC acknowledged that USAC was out of \ncompliance with improper payment reporting require-\nments.  See Letter from Mark Stephens, supra, at 1. \n* * * \nSection 254 reflects a policy goal of making telecom-\nmunications services available to all Americans.  It is \nemphatically the province of Congress to make such pol-\nicy choices.  But it is our judicial duty to ensure that \nCongress pursued its goal through lawful means.  And \n\n11a \n \nin that regard, our brief survey of the USF\u2019s history \nmakes three things clear.  First, Congress\u2019s instruc-\ntions are so ambiguous that it is unclear whether Amer-\nicans should contribute $1.37 billion, $9 billion, or any \nother sum to pay for universal service.  Second, private \nentities bear important responsibility for universal ser-\nvice policy choices.  And third, it is impossible for an \naggrieved citizen to know who bears responsibility for \nthe USF\u2019s serious waste and fraud problems.  All three \nof those things implicate bedrock constitutional princi-\nples. \nII. \nA. \nOn November 2, 2021, USAC proposed its Q1 2022 \nUSF contribution amount.  A subset of the Petitioners \nin this action filed a comment with FCC challenging the \nconstitutionality of the universal service contribution \nmechanism on November 19.  On December 13, 2021, \nFCC issued a public notice of its Proposed Q1 2022 USF \nTax, which was derived directly from USAC\u2019s proposed \ncontribution amount.  Petitioners re-filed their com-\nment on December 22.  FCC took no action with re-\nspect to USAC\u2019s proposed contribution amount, so on \nDecember 27 the contribution factor was deemed ap-\nproved.  See 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.709(a)(3).  Petitioners \nthen filed a timely petition for review in our court. \nB. \nWe have statutory jurisdiction under 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 402 \nand 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342.2  FCC does not contest our con-\n \n2  Before the panel, FCC argued that we lack statutory jurisdic-\ntion because the petition was not timely filed.  The panel rejected \n \n\n12a \n \nstitutional jurisdiction, but we have an obligation to con-\nsider jurisdictional questions sua sponte even when they \nare not raised by the parties.  See E.T. v. Paxton, 41 \nF.4th 709, 718 n.2 (5th Cir. 2022). \nConsistent with that obligation, we note that at least \none petitioner\u2014Cause Based Commerce\u2014had Article \nIII standing when the petition was filed.  See Biden v. \nNebraska, 143 S. Ct. 2355, 2365 (2023) (\u201cIf at least one \nplaintiff has standing, the suit may proceed.\u201d); Ad-\nvanced Mgmt. Tech., Inc. v. FAA, 211 F.3d 633, 636 \n(D.C. Cir. 2000) (\u201cStanding is assessed at the time the \naction commences.\u201d  (citation and quotation omitted)).  \nCause Based Commerce incurred a classic pocketbook \ninjury as a result of its legal obligation to pay the USF \nTax.  Its injury is fairly traceable to the challenged \nconduct because the size of its Q1 2022 USF liability was \ncontrolled by the contribution factor set by USAC.  \nAnd, at the time the petition was filed, its injury could \nhave been redressed by a favorable judicial decision be-\ncause vacatur of FCC\u2019s approval of the proposed contri-\nbution factor would have prevented collection of the \nUSF Tax.  See 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.709(a)(3) (\u201c[T]he Admin-\nistrator shall apply the quarterly contribution factor, \nonce approved by the Commission, to contributor\u2019s in-\nterstate and international end-user telecommunications \nrevenues to calculate the amount of individual contribu-\ntions.\u201d  (emphasis added)). \n \n \n \nthat argument, see Consumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, 63 F.4th 441, 446 (5th \nCir. 2023), reh\u2019g en banc granted, opinion vacated, 72 F.4th 107 \n(5th Cir. 2023), and FCC has abandoned it. \n\n13a \n \nIt is not clear that Cause Based Commerce\u2019s pocket-\nbook injury is still redressable because sovereign im-\nmunity may bar recovery of the monies it paid into USF \npursuant to the Q1 2022 USF Tax.  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702 \n(waiving sovereign immunity for actions against agen-\ncies seeking relief \u201cother than money damages\u201d).  If \nthat is right, Cause Based Commerce\u2019s challenge might \nbe moot because no court-ordered relief could redress \nthe injuries it incurred as a result of the Q1 2022 USF \nTax.  See Already, LLC v. Nike, Inc., 568 U.S. 85, 91 \n(2013) (\u201cA case becomes moot\u2014and therefore no longer \na \u2018Case\u2019 or \u2018Controversy\u2019 for purposes of Article III\u2014\nwhen the issues presented are no longer live or the par-\nties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.\u201d  \n(quotation and citation omitted)). \nWe need not reach that question, however, because \neven assuming Cause Based Commerce\u2019s injury is no \nlonger redressable, it is nonetheless justiciable because \nit is capable of repetition yet evading review.  See, e.g., \nS. Pac. Terminal Co. v. Interstate Com. Comm\u2019n, 219 \nU.S. 498, 515 (1911) (establishing the exception and not-\ning that jurisdiction \u201cought not to be  . . .  defeated, \nby short term orders, capable of repetition, yet evading \nreview\u201d because otherwise the government and regu-\nlated parties would \u201chave their rights determined by the \nCommission without a chance of [judicial] redress\u201d).  \nThe Q1 2022 USF Tax evades review because it was in \nforce for just one quarter\u2014\u201ctoo short [a] duration to be \nfully litigated in the United States Supreme Court be-\nfore it expire[d].\u201d  Ralls Corp. v. Comm. on Foreign \nInv. in U.S., 758 F.3d 296, 321 (D.C.

And it is capable of repetition because there is \n\u201ca reasonable expectation\u201d\u2014indeed, a near certainty\u2014\n\u201cthat [Cause Based Commerce] will be subjected to the \nsame action again.\u201d  Id. at 323; see id. at 324 (\u201cThe \nsame action generally refers to  . . .  recurrent iden-\ntical agency actions.\u201d (quotation and citations omitted)); \nsee also 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.709(a)(3) (providing that a new \ncontribution factor is calculated each quarter). \nAccordingly, we have jurisdiction to decide the mer-\nits of petitioners\u2019 constitutional claims. \nC. \nWe must decide one more threshold issue.  On June \n17, 2024, FCC filed a motion to dismiss on the that \nground issue preclusion bars the petition for review.  \nIn FCC\u2019s view, that is because petitioners raised identi-\ncal challenges to different USF quarterly contribution \nfactors in the Sixth and Eleventh Circuits, and those \ncourts rejected petitioners\u2019 arguments.  But even if \nthere were something to FCC\u2019s issue preclusion argu-\nment, it fails because FCC forfeited it. \n\u201c[I]ssue preclusion[] is an affirmative defense.\u201d  Tay-\nlor v. Sturgell, 553 U.S. 880, 907 (2008).  That means \nthe party asserting preclusion ordinarily must timely \nraise it.  Ibid.; see 18A CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT, AR-\nTHUR R. MILLER, & EDWARD H. COOPER, FEDERAL \nPRACTICE & PROCEDURE \u00a7 4405 (3d ed. 2017).  Where, \nas here, an allegedly preclusive judgment is rendered \nafter suit is filed, the party \u201cwishing to raise [preclusion] \nis obliged to assert it at the earliest moment practica-\nble.\u201d  Home Depot, Inc. v. Guste, 773 F.2d 616, 620 n.4 \n(5th Cir. 1985); see Evans v. Syracuse City Sch. Dist., \n\n15a \n \n704 F.2d 44, 47 (2d Cir. 1983) (\u201c[T]he party wishing to \nraise [preclusion as a] defense is obliged to plead it at \nthe earliest possible moment.\u201d  (quotation omitted)); \nAetna Cas. & Sur. Co. v. Gen. Dynamics Corp., 968 F.2d \n707, 711 (8th Cir. 1992) (issue preclusion must be raised \n\u201cat the first reasonable opportunity after the rendering \nof the decision having the preclusive effect\u201d); Davignon \nv. Clemmey, 322 F.3d 1, 15 (1st Cir. 2003) (holding that \ndistrict court abused its discretion by allowing defend-\nant to assert preclusion defense \u201cat the eleventh hour\u201d); \nGeorgia Pac. Consumer Prod., LP v. Von Drehle Corp., \n710 F.3d 527, 533 (4th Cir. 2013) (\u201cEven when a preclu-\nsion defense is not available at the outset of a case, a \nparty may waive such a defense arising during the \ncourse of litigation by waiting too long to assert the de-\nfense after it becomes available.\u201d); Arizona v. Califor-\nnia, 530 U.S. 392, 413 (2000) (holding that party could \nnot raise preclusion as a defense when party could have \nraised the defense earlier in the proceedings but did not, \n\u201cdespite ample opportunity and cause to do so\u201d). \nThat makes sense.  The policy underlying issue pre-\nclusion is based primarily on a \u201cdefendant\u2019s interest in \navoiding the burdens of twice defending a suit\u201d and \u201cthe \navoidance of unnecessary judicial waste.\u201d  Arizona, \n530 U.S. at 412 (quoting United States v. Sioux Nation, \n448 U.S. 371, 432 (1980) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting)).  \nIssue preclusion cannot serve either of those purposes if \nit is raised in the eleventh hour of proceedings, after the \ndefendant and the court have already carried all the bur-\ndens necessary to decide the case.  So even assuming \nFCC could defeat petitioners\u2019 claims on the ground the \nSixth and the Eleventh Circuits have rendered preclu-\nsive judgments, FCC was obliged to raise that issue \u201cat \n\n16a \n \nthe earliest moment practicable.\u201d  Guste, 773 F.2d at \n620 n.4. \nIt did not.  The first allegedly preclusive judgment \nFCC cites is the Sixth Circuit\u2019s judgment in Consumers\u2019 \nResearch v. FCC.  See 67 F.4th 773 (6th Cir. 2023), cert. \ndenied Consumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, No. 23-456, 2024 WL \n2883753 (U.S. June 10, 2024). That judgment bound six \nof the named petitioners in this case.3  And it was final \non June 7, 2023.  See Mandate Issued, Consumers\u2019 Rsch., \n67 F.4th 773 (No. 21-3886) (Jun. 7, 2023).  True, the pe-\ntitioners sought certiorari in that case.  But \u201cthe gen-\neral rule in American jurisprudence [is] that a final \njudgment of a court  . . .  can be given [preclusive] ef-\nfect even while an appeal is pending.\u201d  Prymer v. Og-\nden, 29 F.3d 1208, 1213 n.2 (7th Cir. 1994); see WRIGHT \n& MILLER, supra, \u00a7 4433 (\u201c[I]t is  . . .  held in federal \ncourts that the preclusive effects of a lower court judg-\nment cannot be suspended simply by taking an appeal \nthat remains undecided.\u201d); RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF \nJUDGMENTS \u00a7 13, cmt. f (explaining a \u201cjudgment other-\nwise final\u201d for purposes of the law of res judicata should \n\u201cremain[] so despite the taking of an appeal\u201d). \nThat means FCC could have asserted preclusion \nagainst six petitioners on June 7, 2023.  At the very \nleast, FCC could have raised preclusion in its supple-\nmental brief, which it filed on August 30, 2023.  But \nFCC did not do so.  Instead, it waited more than a year \nand then filed a tardy motion to dismiss at the eleventh \nhour.  FCC therefore forfeited its preclusion defense \n \n3  Consumers\u2019 Research, Cause Based Commerce, Deanna Roth, \nJeremy Roth, Joseph Bayly, Lynn Gibbs, and Paul Gibbs. \n\n17a \n \nwith respect to at least six petitioners.4  So there is no \ndoubt we may proceed to the merits of those petitioners\u2019 \nclaims. \nFCC also cites the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s judgment in \nConsumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, 88 F.4th 917, 923 (11th Cir. \n2023), cert. denied Consumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, No. 23-743, \n2024 WL 2883755 (U.S. June 10, 2024).  That judgment \nbound all the petitioners in this case, including the six \nwho were parties to the Sixth Circuit proceeding. But \nthat another allegedly preclusive judgment was ren-\ndered during the course of this proceeding does not \nchange the fact that FCC had a purported preclusion \ndefense against six petitioners as of June 7, 2023.  And \neven if the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s judgment somehow gave \nFCC a new window to raise a preclusion defense against \nthose petitioners, the window closed before FCC raised \nit.  The Eleventh Circuit\u2019s judgment was final (and \ntherefore had preclusive effect) on February 5, 2024.  \nSee Mandate Issued, Consumers\u2019 Research v. FCC, 88 \nF.4th 917 (No. 22-13315) (Feb. 5, 2024).  FCC nonethe-\nless waited to file a motion to dismiss on the basis of that \njudgment until June 17, 2024\u2014more than four months \nlater. \nThere may sometimes be ambiguity about whether a \ndefendant carried its obligation to raise a preclusion de-\nfense \u201cat the earliest moment practicable.\u201d  Guste, 773 \nF.2d at 620 n.4.  But this is not a close case.  Litigants \nordinarily have 21 days to plead an affirmative defense.  \nSee FED. R. CIV. P. 12(a)(1)(A)(ii); see also WRIGHT & \nMILLER, supra, \u00a7 1394 (noting affirmative defenses are \n \n4  Including Cause Based Commerce, who certainly has standing.  \nSee supra, at 11. \n\n18a \n \nforfeited if they are not raised in responsive pleadings). \nThere is no reason a party should have six times that \nmany days to raise an affirmative defense to a petition \nfor review. So even if we thought FCC could have as-\nserted preclusion against all the petitioners within a rea-\nsonable time after the Eleventh Circuit rendered judg-\nment, we would hold FCC failed to do so. \nIn sum, FCC forfeited any preclusion defense.  \nTrue, we have discretion to forgive a forfeiture in \u201cex-\ntraordinary circumstances\u201d\u2014as where \u201ca miscarriage \nof justice would result from our failure to consider\u201d the \nforfeited argument.  See, e.g., AG Acceptance Corp. v. \nVeigel, 564 F.3d 695, 700 (5th Cir. 2009).  But FCC does \nnot supply any reason to think a miscarriage of justice \nwould result from our reaching the merits of petitioners\u2019 \nclaims.  See ibid. (explaining the burden of establishing \nextraordinary circumstances is on the party seeking re-\nview).  And we cannot think of one.  In fact, if we do \nnot decide the constitutional questions presented in this \ncase, we will have to decide them in a pending challenge \nthat includes petitioners who were not parties to the \nSixth or Eleventh Circuit proceedings.  See Petition \nfor Review, Consumers\u2019 Research v. FCC, No. 24-60330 \n(5th Cir. Jun. 27, 2024).  It effects no injustice to hold \nFCC to its forfeiture.5 \n \n5  FCC convinced the Supreme Court to deny certiorari in the \nSixth and Eleventh Circuit cases in part by explaining the Court \nwould have another chance to consider the constitutionality of the \nUSF after this court\u2019s en banc ruling.  See Br. in Opp\u2019n 17-18, \nConsumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, Nos. 23-456, 23-743 (U.S. May 3, 2024) \n(\u201c[T]he en banc Fifth Circuit has not yet issued its decision in that \ncase.  Once it does so, the parties can determine whether to seek, \nand this Court can determine whether to grant, certiorari to review \n \n\n19a \n \n* * * \nWe therefore proceed to the merits. Our review is de \nnovo.  See Huwaei Tech. USA, Inc. v. FCC, 2 F.4th 421, \n434 (5th Cir. 2021). \nIII. \nPetitioners contend the universal service contribu-\ntion mechanism violates the Legislative Vesting Clause.  \nSee U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 1 (\u201cAll legislative Powers herein \ngranted shall be vested in a Congress of the United \nStates, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Rep-\nresentatives.\u201d).  We agree.  We (A) explain that the \npower to levy USF \u201ccontributions\u201d is the power to tax\u2014\na quintessentially legislative power.  Then we (B) ex-\nplain that Congress through 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254 may have \ndelegated legislative power to FCC because it pur-\nported to confer upon FCC the power to tax without sup-\nplying an intelligible principle to guide FCC\u2019s discre-\ntion.  Next, we (C) explain that FCC may have imper-\nmissibly delegated the taxing power to private entities.  \nFinally, we (D) explain that we need not definitively an-\nswer either delegation question because even if \u00a7 254 \ncontains an intelligible principle, and even if FCC was \npermitted to enlist private entities to determine how \nmuch universal service tax revenue it should raise, the \ncombination of Congress\u2019s broad delegation to FCC and \nFCC\u2019s subdelegation to private entities certainly amounts \nto a constitutional violation. \n \nthat decision.\u201d).  Had FCC told the Supreme Court it thought pe-\ntitioners\u2019 claims in this court were issue precluded, the Court might \nhave granted certiorari in those other cases.  It would be unjust \nto allow FCC to raise an issue to evade en banc review so soon after \nit hid that issue to evade Supreme Court review. \n\n20a \n \nA. \nSection 254(d) provides that \u201c[e]very telecommunica-\ntions carrier that provides interstate telecommunica-\ntions services shall contribute, on an equitable and non-\ndiscriminatory basis, to the specific, predictable, and \nsufficient mechanisms established by the Commission  \nto preserve and advance universal service.\u201d  47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(d).  Pursuant to this authority, FCC mandates \nthat \u201ctelecommunications carriers  . . .  must con-\ntribute to the universal service support mechanisms.\u201d  \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.706(a).  USAC determines carriers\u2019 \nUSF contribution obligations on a quarterly basis by \n\u201capply[ing] the quarterly contribution factor  . . .  to \n[each carriers\u2019] interstate and  international  end-user  \ntelecommunications  revenues.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 54.709(a)(3).  \nThe result is a USAC-fashioned USF Tax. \nFCC\u2019s principal defense of the USF scheme is that \nthe USF Tax is not really a tax at all.  Rather, FCC \ncontends, it is a fee.  That is because, FCC reasons, a \nfee is a charge that \u201cbestows a benefit on the [payor], \nnot shared by other members of society.\u201d  Nat\u2019l Cable \nTelevision Ass\u2019n v. United States, 415 U.S. 336, 341 \n(1974).  And FCC thinks universal service contribu-\ntions comport with that definition because telecommuni-\ncations carriers pay them, and because they are used to \nfund the universal service program, which \u201cconfers spe-\ncial benefits on contributing carriers by (among other \nthings) expanding the network such carriers can serve.\u201d \nFCC EB Br. 51. \nBut FCC misunderstands the nature of the inquiry. \nA fee has three characteristics:  First, fees are in-\ncurred \u201cincident to a voluntary act.\u201d  Nat\u2019l Cable, 415 \nU.S. at 341; see also Krotoszynski, Jr., Reconsidering \n\n21a \n \nthe Nondelegation Doctrine, supra, at 270 (\u201cA \u2018fee\u2019 con-\nstitutes a charge that an agency exacts in return for a \nbenefit voluntarily sought by the payer.\u201d).  For exam-\nple, \u201c[a] public agency might charge a user fee to visit a \npublic park, tour a museum, or enter a toll road.\u201d  \nTrafigura Trading LLC v. United States, 29 F.4th 286, \n293 (5th Cir. 2022) (Opinion of Ho, J.); see also ibid. (not-\ning that fees \u201carise in the context of value-for-value trans-\nactions\u201d between individuals and government).  The \ngovernment may also charge fees designed to defray the \ncost of providing benefits to a regulated party, but only \nif the fees charged represent a \u201cfair approximation of \nservices, facilities, or benefits furnished.\u201d  United \nStates v. U.S. Shoe Corp., 523 U.S. 360, 363 (1998).  \nSecond, a fee generally is \u201cimposed by an administrative \nagency upon only those persons, or entities, subject to \nits regulation for regulatory purposes.\u201d  Valero Ter-\nrestrial Corp. v. Caffrey, 205 F.3d 130, 134 (4th Cir. \n2000).  And third, the revenue the government raises \nthrough its collection of fees is used to supply benefits \ninuring to the persons or entities paying them rather \nthan to the public generally.  See Skinner v. Mid-Am. \nPipeline Co., 490 U.S. 212, 223 (1989) (quoting Nat\u2019l Ca-\nble, 415 U.S. at 343). \nUniversal service contributions do not have any of \nthese characteristics.  First, they are not incident to a \nvoluntary act but rather are a condition of doing busi-\nness in the telecommunications industry.  See 47 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 254(d).  Nor do they represent a fair approxi-\nmation of the benefits conferred by government regula-\ntion on telecommunications carriers.  In fact, they are \nnot related to regulatory costs at all.  They are de-\nsigned to fund telecommunications subsidies to schools, \nlibraries, healthcare facilities, and low-income individu-\n\n22a \n \nals.  Second, the cost of universal service contributions \nis not borne by parties FCC regulates. While FCC for-\nmally imposes the charges on telecommunications carri-\ners, carriers overwhelmingly pass the cost of contribu-\ntions on to consumers, as is expressly permitted by FCC \nregulation.  See FCC, REPORT TO CONGRESS, supra, at \n45-46; 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.712(a).  So the cost of universal \nservice contributions is widely shared by the population \nin a manner reminiscent of a \u201cclassic tax.\u201d  See Valero, \n205 F.3d at 134 (\u201cThe \u2018classic tax\u2019 is imposed by the leg-\nislature upon a large segment of society.\u201d).  And third, \nthe benefits associated with universal service contribu-\ntions \u201cinure to the benefit of the public\u201d\u2014or more accu-\nrately to the benefit of those fortunate enough to receive \nsubsidies from USAC\u2014rather than to the benefit of the \npersons who pay them.  Skinner, 490 U.S. at 223 (quot-\ning Nat\u2019l Cable, 415 U.S. at 343).  There is no overlap \nat all between the class of USF beneficiaries (recipients \nof subsidized telecommunications services) and the class \nof USF contributors (American telecommunications \nconsumers who see USF charges on their phone bills \neach month). \nThink about the consequences of FCC\u2019s position: \n\u2022 Congress could fund Medicare and Medicaid with-\nout \u201ctaxing\u201d anyone.  It could simply allow hospi-\ntal executives to set the Medicare-Medicaid budget, \nthen have HHS rubber-stamp the hospitals\u2019 health-\ncare taxes, which could then be passed through to \nconsumers\u2019 hospital bills. \n\u2022 Congress could fund the Supplemental Nutrition \nAssistance Program (\u201cSNAP\u201d) without \u201ctaxing\u201d \nanyone.  It could simply allow grocery store exec-\nutives to set the SNAP budget, then have USDA \n\n23a \n \nrubber-stamp the grocers\u2019 SNAP taxes, which \ncould then be passed through to consumers at the \ncheckout register. \n\u2022 Congress could fund affordable housing without \n\u201ctaxing\u201d anyone.  It could simply allow real estate \ncompanies to set the affordable housing budget, \nthen have HUD rubber-stamp the companies  \naffordable-housing taxes, which could then be \npassed through to consumers as new line items at \nclosing or in monthly surcharges for rent. \nWe could go on.  But you get the point:  All of these \nare obviously taxes.  So while \u201c[d]istinguishing a tax \nfrom a fee often is a difficult task,\u201d Tex. Ent. Ass\u2019n, Inc. \nv. Hegar, 10 F.4th 495, 505 (5th Cir. 2021) (citation omit-\nted), the analysis here is straightforward.  Congress \nhas bestowed upon FCC the power to levy taxes, and we \naccordingly conclude that it has delegated its taxing \npower.6 \nB. \nIn \u00a7 254 of the Telecommunications Act, Congress \ndelegated its taxing power to FCC.  The power to tax \nis a quintessentially legislative one.  See U.S. CONST. \nart. 1, \u00a7 8, cl. 1; see also Nat\u2019l Cable, 415 U.S. at 340 \n(\u201cTaxation is a legislative function, and Congress  . . .  \nis the sole organ for levying taxes.\u201d); MICHAEL W. \nMCCONNELL, THE PRESIDENT WHO WOULD NOT BE \n \n6  The fact that Congress euphemistically labeled these universal \nservice charges \u201ccontribution[s],\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(d), is irrelevant.  \n\u201cCongress cannot change whether an exaction is a tax  . . .  for \nconstitutional purposes simply by\u201d relabeling it.  Nat\u2019l Fed\u2019n of \nIndep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 544 (2012) (emphasis in orig-\ninal). \n\n24a \n \nKING 334 (2020) (noting that domestic taxation is \u201cespe-\ncially central to the legislative branch\u201d).  So \u00a7 254 is \nconstitutional only if it passes nondelegation muster.  \nWe (1) explain the nondelegation doctrine as articulated \nby the Supreme Court. Then we (2) explain the breadth \nof Congress\u2019s delegation to FCC.  Lastly, we (3) ex-\nplain that the Supreme Court has never upheld a dele-\ngation of core legislative power as sweeping as the one \ncontained in \u00a7 254. \nThe Constitution vests \u201c[a]ll legislative Powers \nherein granted\u201d \u201c in a Congress of the United States.\u201d  \nU.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 1.  \u201cAccompanying that assign-\nment of power to Congress is a bar on its further dele-\ngation.\u201d Gundy v. United States, 588 U.S. 128, 135 \n(2019) (plurality op.). Moreover, \u201cthe principle of sepa-\nration of powers that underlies our tripartite system of \nGovernment\u201d independently compels the conclusion \nthat Congress, not agencies, must make legislative deci-\nsions.  Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 371 \n(1989); see Gundy, 588 U.S. at 153 (Gorsuch, J., dissent-\ning) (\u201c[I]t would frustrate the system of government or-\ndained by the Constitution if Congress could merely an-\nnounce vague aspirations and then assign others the re-\nsponsibility of adopting legislation to realize its goals.\u201d \n(quotation omitted)).  So there is no doubt that \u201cthe \nlawmaking function belongs to Congress,\u201d Loving v. \nUnited States, 517 U.S. 748, 758 (1996), and that Con-\ngress \u201cmay not constitutionally delegate that power to \nanother\u201d constitutional actor, Touby v. United States, \n500 U.S. 160, 165 (1991). \nBut \u201c[t]he Constitution has never been regarded as \ndenying to the Congress the necessary resources of flex-\nibility and practicality, which will enable it to perform \n\n25a \n \nits function.\u201d  Panama Refin. Co. v. Ryan, 293 U.S. \n388, 421 (1935).  So the Supreme Court has held that \ndelegations are constitutional so long as Congress \n\u201clay[s] down by legislative act an intelligible principle to \nwhich the person or body authorized [to exercise the del-\negated authority] is directed to conform.\u201d  J.W. Hamp-\nton, Jr., & Co. v. United States, 276 U.S. 394, 409 (1928). \nStill, \u201cthere are limits of delegation which there is no \nconstitutional authority to transcend.\u201d  Panama Re-\nfin., 293 U.S. at 430.  And for good reason.  Vague \ncongressional delegations undermine representative \ngovernment because they give unelected bureaucrats\u2014\nrather than elected representatives\u2014the final say over \nmatters that affect the lives, liberty, and property of \nAmericans.  See Tiger Lily, LLC v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Hous. \n& Urb. Dev., 5 F.4th 666, 674 (6th Cir. 2021) (Thapar, J., \nconcurring) (\u201cBy shifting responsibility to a less ac-\ncountable branch, Congress  . . .  deprives the people \nof the say the framers intended them to have.\u201d).  \nOverly broad delegations also obscure accountability:  \nWhen elected representatives shirk hard choices, con-\nstituents do not know whom to hold accountable for gov-\nernment action.  See Gundy, 588 U.S. at 156 (Gorsuch, \nJ., dissenting).  And they offend the deliberation- \nforcing features of the constitutionally prescribed legis-\nlative process.  See U.S. CONST. art. I, \u00a7 7; John Man-\nning, Lawmaking Made Easy, 10 GREEN BAG 2d 191, \n202 (2007) (\u201c[B]icameralism and presentment make law-\nmaking difficult by design.\u201d  (emphasis in original)); \nsee also THE FEDERALIST No. 73 (A. Hamilton) (noting \nthat the Constitution prescribed elaborate procedures \nfor lawmaking because \u201c[t]he oftener the measure is \nbrought under examination, the greater the diversity in \nthe situations of those who are to examine it, the less \n\n26a \n \nmust be the danger of those errors which flow from want \nof due deliberation, or of those missteps which proceed \nfrom the contagion of some common passion or inter-\nest.\u201d). \nSo while \u201cthe Supreme Court has not in the past sev-\neral decades held that Congress failed to provide a req-\nuisite intelligible principle,\u201d Jarkesy v. SEC, 34 F.4th \n446, 462 (5th Cir. 2022), aff\u200a\u2019d on other grounds, 144 S. \nCt. 2117 (2024), \u201c[t]hat does not mean  . . .  we must \nrubber-stamp all delegations of legislative power,\u201d Big \nTime Vapes, Inc. v. FDA., 963 F.3d 436, 443 (5th Cir. \n2020).  Rather, \u201c[w]e ought not to shy away from our \njudicial duty to invalidate unconstitutional delegations.\u201d  \nIbid.

Gundy, 588 U.S. at 135 (plurality op.).  So we \nmust construe \u201cthe challenged statute to figure out what \ntask it delegates and what instructions it provides.\u201d  \nId. at 136.  Petitioners challenge the USF\u2019s funding \nmechanism, so we must consider whether 47 U.S.C.  \n\u00a7 254 sufficiently instructs FCC regarding how much it \nshould tax Americans to pay for the universal service \nprogram. \nTwo of \u00a7 254\u2019s subsections are relevant:  \u00a7 254(d) \nprovides that USF funding should be \u201csufficient  . . .  \nto preserve and advance universal service,\u201d and \u00a7 254(b)(1) \nsuggests that telecommunications services \u201cshould be \navailable at  . . .  affordable rates.\u201d \n\n27a \n \nThese statutory phrases supply no principle at all. \nStart with sufficiency.  That funding should be \u201csuffi-\ncient  . . .  to preserve and advance universal ser-\nvice\u201d is meaningful only if the concept of universal ser-\nvice is sufficiently intelligible.  It is not.  Rather, uni-\nversal service is \u201can evolving level of telecommunica-\ntions services that the Commission shall establish peri-\nodically\u201d by determining what telecommunications ser-\nvices are \u201cessential to education, public health, or public \nsafety\u201d; are \u201csubscribed to by a substantial majority of \nresidential customers\u201d; are \u201cdeployed  . . .  by tele-\ncommunications carriers\u201d; or are otherwise \u201cconsistent \nwith the public interest, convenience, and necessity.\u201d  \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(c).  That is a lot of words, but they \namount to a concept of universal service so amorphous \nthat Congress\u2019s instruction to raise \u201csufficient\u201d funds \namounts to a suggestion that FCC exact as much tax \nrevenue for universal service projects as FCC thinks is \ngood.  Cf. Gary Lawson, Delegation and Original Mean-\ning, 88 VA. L. REV. 327, 339-40 (2002) (describing conse-\nquences of congressional enactment that requires \n\u201c\u200a\u2018goodness and niceness\u2019\u200a\u201d). \nThat \u00a7 254(b) supplies minimal guidance on the con-\ntours of Congress\u2019s idea of an ideal universal service pol-\nicy is no answer.  That is for three reasons.  First, we \nhave previously accepted FCC\u2019s contention that \u201cnoth-\ning in [\u00a7 254] defines \u2018sufficient\u2019 to mean that universal \nservice support must equal the actual costs incurred by\u201d \ntelecommunications carriers contributing to the USF.  \nTOPUC I, 183 F.3d at 412.  So FCC\u2019s universal service \ntaxation is not formally limited by the amount it dis-\nburses on universal service projects.  Nothing in the \nstatute precludes FCC from, for example, imposing the \nUSF Tax to create an endowment that it could use to \n\n28a \n \nfund whatever projects it might like.  FCC has never \ndone so, but the fact \u201cthat the recipients of illicitly dele-\ngated authority opted not to make use of it is no anti-\ndote.  It is Congress\u2019s decision to delegate that is un-\nconstitutional.\u201d  Dep\u2019t of Transp. v. Ass\u2019n of Am. Rail-\nroads (\u201cAmtrak II\u201d), 575 U.S. 43, 62 (2015) (Alito, J., \nconcurring) (emphasis in original) (quotation omitted) \n(quoting Ass\u2019n of Am. Railroads v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Transp. \n(\u201cAmtrak I\u201d), 721 F.3d 666, 674 (D.C. Cir. 2013), vacated \nand remanded sub nom. Amtrak II, 575 U.S. 43); see \nWhitman v. Am. Trucking Ass\u2019n, 531 U.S. 457, 472 \n(2001) (\u201cWe have never suggested that an agency can \ncure an unlawful delegation of legislative power by \nadopting in its discretion a limiting construction of the \nstatute.\u201d). \nSecond, even if FCC\u2019s power to levy taxes were lim-\nited by the amount it disburses on universal service pro-\njects, subsection (b) still would not curb FCC\u2019s discre-\ntion because we have explained it sets out \u201caspirational\u201d \nprinciples rather than \u201cinexorable statutory com-\nmand[s].\u201d  TOPUC I, 183 F.3d at 421; see also Tex. Off. \nof Pub. Util. Couns. v. FCC, 265 F.3d 313, 321 (5th Cir. \n2001).  And even if the principles in subsection (b) were \nmore than aspirational, they still would not meaning-\nfully limit FCC because \u00a7 254(b)(7) vests FCC with dis-\ncretion to formulate \u201cother principles\u201d so long as it con-\nsiders the additional principles to be \u201cnecessary and ap-\npropriate for the protection of the public interest, con-\nvenience, and necessity and  . . .  consistent with\u201d \nthe rest of Chapter 5 of Title 47 of the United States \nCode.  In other words, FCC \u201cmay roam at will,\u201d A.L.A. \nSchechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495, \n538 (1935), disregarding \u00a7 254(b)\u2019s enumerated princi-\nples altogether when it thinks the \u201cpublic interest\u201d  \n\n29a \n \nwarrants the journey.  47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(c)(1)(D); id.  \n\u00a7 254(b)(7). \nThird, even if the principles in \u00a7 254(b) in some way \nbind FCC, they are contentless in important respects. \nFor example, \u00a7 254(b)(6) suggests that \u201c[e]lementary \nand secondary schools and classrooms  . . .  and li-\nbraries should have access to advanced telecommunica-\ntions services as described in subsection (h).\u201d  But sub-\nsection (h) says only that \u201celementary schools, second-\nary schools, and libraries\u201d should have access to tele-\ncommunications services \u201cfor educational purposes at \nrates less than the amounts charged for similar services \nto other parties.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 254(h)(1)(B).  Which services?  \nPresumably those FCC thinks are \u201cessential to educa-\ntion\u201d or otherwise within the ambit of its self-defined \nuniversal service utopia.  Id. \u00a7 254(c).  But how is \nFCC to make that determination?  And which schools \nand libraries should receive subsidized services?  And \nhow much less should they pay? \nCongress never said.  FCC has answered some of \nthese questions, see 47 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 54.501, .502, .505, but \nit remains a mystery how we are supposed to \u201cascertain \nwhether the will of Congress has been obeyed.\u201d  Mis-\ntretta, 488 U.S. at 379 (citation omitted).  Each of the \n\u201caspirational\u201d universal service principles in \u00a7 254(b) & \n(c) is inapposite.7  So apparently your guess is as good \n \n7  Section 254(c)(1)(B) suggests low-income consumers should \nhave access to telecommunications services comparable to those \nsubscribed to by unsubsidized residential customers.  And \u00a7 254(b)(3) \ntells FCC to make telecommunications services available in rural \nareas at rates comparable to those charged in urban areas.  Those \nprovisions may supply sufficient guidance for FCC to execute cer-\ntain aspects of the universal service program.  But nothing in the \n \n\n30a \n \nas ours is as good as FCC\u2019s is as good as any random \nAmerican taxpayer\u2019s. And funding for schools and li-\nbraries is not merely an interstitial gap in the statutory \nscheme.  It constituted more than a third of the contri-\nbution amount that gave rise to these proceedings. See \nJA.101.8 \nSo if \u00a7 254(b) binds at all, it is apparent that the only \nreal constraint on FCC\u2019s discretion to levy excise taxes \non telecommunications carriers (and American consum-\ners in turn) is that rates \u201cshould\u201d remain \u201caffordable.\u201d  \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(b)(1); see Consumers\u2019 Rsch., 67 F.4th at \n794 (\u201c[E]xcess subsidization in some cases may detract \nfrom universal service by causing rates unnecessarily to \nrise, thereby pricing some consumers out of the mar-\nket.\u201d  (citation omitted)).  But saying telecommunica-\ntions services \u201cshould\u201d remain \u201caffordable\u201d amounts to \n\u201cno guidance whatsoever.\u201d  Jarkesy, 34 F.4th at 462 \n(emphasis in original).  How is FCC to determine \nwhether the USF Tax it mandates has made telecommu-\nnications services unaffordable?  The demand for cell \nphones is uncommonly inelastic because cell phones are \n \nstatute remotely suggests FCC should provide universal service \nfunding only to low-income or rural schools.  So \u00a7\u00a7 (b)(3) and \n(c)(1)(B) cannot supply the limiting principle that \u00a7 (h)(1)(B) lacks. \nAnd the fact that FCC has limited universal service funding to low-\nincome schools is, once again, irrelevant.  See Am. Trucking, 531 \nU.S. at 472.  The question is whether the statute itself in any way \nlimits FCC\u2019s discretion to supply universal service funding for ed-\nucational programs, and it plainly does not. \n8  Both dissenting opinions contend 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254 is loaded with \nintelligible principles.  See post, at 77-82 (Stewart, J., dissenting); \nid. at 101-02 (Higginson, J., dissenting).  But neither identifies \nany principle that might guide FCC in determining how much less \nschools and libraries should pay for telecommunications services. \n\n31a \n \nessential to participation in the modern world.  See \nCarpenter v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 2206, 2220 (2018) \n(\u201c[C]ell phones and the services they provide are such a \npervasive and insistent part of daily life that carrying \none is indispensable to participation in modern society.\u201d  \n(citation and quotation omitted)).  That means the \nFCC could impose eye-watering USF Taxes while also \narguing with a straight face that cell phones remain \u201caf-\nfordable\u201d in the sense that most Americans would choose \nto keep using them.  And that means \u00a7 254 leaves FCC \n\u2014and as importantly reviewing courts9\u2014utterly at sea.  \nIs a 25% excise tax excessively burdensome under  \n\u00a7 254(b)(1)?  250%?  2500%?  There are no answers \nbecause Congress never gave them. \nFinally, the breadth of \u00a7 254\u2019s delegation is especially \ntroubling because the statute insulates FCC from the \nprincipal tool Congress has to control FCC\u2019s universal \nservice decisions\u2014the appropriations power.  See U.S. \nConst. art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 7 (\u201cNo Money shall be drawn from \nthe Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations \nmade by Law.\u201d).  Ordinarily, when Congress delegates \nbroadly, it retains a residuum of control over agency ac-\ntion because the agency is powerless to act without a \ncongressional appropriation of funds.  See CFPB v. All \nAm. Check Cashing, Inc., 33 F.4th 218, 232 (5th Cir. \n2022) (Jones, J., concurring) (\u201cCongress\u2019s supremacy in \nfiscal matters makes the executive branch dependent on \nthe legislative branch for subsistence, thereby forging a \n \n9  See Mistretta, 488 U.S. at 379 (noting courts are \u201cjustified\u201d in \ninvalidating delegations where it would be \u201cimpossible in a proper \nproceeding to ascertain whether the will of Congress has been \nobeyed\u201d) (quoting Yakus v. United States, 321 U.S. 414, 425-26 \n(1944)). \n\n32a \n \nvital line of accountability between the executive branch \nand the legislative branch and, therefore, the people.  \nRecent history confirms that Congress\u2019s appropriations \npowers have proven a forcible lever of accountability: \nCongress has tightened the purse strings to express dis-\npleasure with an agency\u2019s nefarious activities and even \nto end armed combat.\u201d).  So even when statutes vest \nagencies with significant discretion, the appropriations \nprocess generally ensures agencies remain subservient \nto the will of the people as expressed through their elec-\nted representatives.  See Jonathan H. Adler & Chris-\ntopher J. Walker, Delegation and Time, 105 IOWA L. \nREV. 1931, 1957 (2020) (cataloguing examples and noting \nthat \u201c[l]imiting appropriations is an effective way to \nlimit an agency\u2019s exercise of delegated power\u201d). \nHere, though, Congress cannot exercise control by \nlimiting appropriations because the whole point of USF \nis to fund universal service outside the regular appro-\npriations process.10  And since FCC commissioners are \n \n10 FCC has concluded that 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254 constitutes \u201ca perma-\nnent indefinite appropriation.\u201d  GAO-05-151, GREATER INVOLVE-\nMENT NEEDED BY FCC IN THE MANAGEMENT AND OVERSIGHT OF \nTHE E-RATE PROGRAM 11 (2005), https://perma.cc/QNU6-YEFS.  \nIf we had to decide whether \u00a7 254 comports with the Appropria-\ntions Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 1, cl. 9, we would apply the Su-\npreme Court\u2019s decision in CFPB v. Cmty. Fin. Servs. Ass\u2019n of Am., \nLtd., 601 U.S. 416 (2024).  But we need not decide that question \nbecause Petitioners did not formally raise an Appropriations \nClause challenge.  Our point is only that, to the extent Congress\u2019s \nability to control agencies through regular appropriations supplies \nsome justification for broad delegations, see, e.g., Christopher J. \nWalker, Restoring Congress\u2019s Role in the Modern Administrative \nState, 116 MICH. L. REV. 1101, 1116 (2018) (explaining the tools \nCongress has, including the appropriations power, \u201cto rein in the \nadministrative state and prevent federal agencies from abusing \n \n\n33a \n \nremovable by the President only for-cause, see 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 154(c)(1)(A), the connection between FCC policy deci-\nsions made pursuant to \u00a7 254 and any democratically ac-\ncountable federal official is extremely attenuated. \n3. \nThe Supreme Court has \u201cover and over upheld even \nvery broad delegations.\u201d  Gundy, 588 U.S. at 146 (plu-\nrality op.).  But it has also suggested the scope of per-\nmissible delegation varies with context.  See Am. Truck-\ning, 531 U.S. at 475 (\u201c[T]he degree of agency discretion \nthat is acceptable varies according to the scope of the \npower congressionally conferred.\u201d); J.W. Hampton, 276 \nU.S. at 406 (\u201cIn determining what [Congress] may do in \nseeking assistance from another branch, the extent and \ncharacter of that assistence [sic] must be fixed accord-\ning to common sense and the inherent necessities of the \ngovernmental co-ordination.\u201d); Loving, 517 U.S. at 768 \n(noting the general rule that \u201ca constitutional power im-\nplies a power of delegation of authority under it suffi-\ncient to effect its purposes\u201d (emphasis added)) (quoting \nLichter v. United States, 334 U.S. 742, 778 (1948)); \nLichter, 334 U.S. at 778-79 (suggesting Congress may \ndelegate its war powers more broadly); Panama Refin., \n293 U.S. at 422 (same).  So the fact that the Court has \nupheld certain broad delegations does not necessarily \ndictate that we uphold \u00a7 254\u2019s delegation of power to \nFCC to levy taxes on American consumers.  And \u00a7 254 \nappears unlike any delegation the Court has ever \nblessed. \n \ntheir consolidated lawmaking and law-execution powers\u201d), that jus-\ntification is absent here. \n\n34a \n \nFor starters, the Supreme Court\u2019s nondelegation \u201cju-\nrisprudence has been driven by a practical understand-\ning that in our increasingly complex society, replete with \never changing and more technical problems, Congress \nsimply cannot do its job absent an ability to delegate \npower under broad general directives.\u201d  Mistretta, 488 \nU.S. at 372 (emphasis added).  So the Court has deemed \nit constitutionally sufficient for Congress to make a pol-\nicy judgment and then direct an agency to give that \njudgment effect through the application of technical \nknowledge. \nFor example, in American Trucking, 531 U.S. 457, \nthe Court considered a congressional directive to EPA \nto set ambient air quality standards for certain pollu-\ntants.  Id. at 472.  It held that the statute supplied an \nintelligible principle because it required EPA to set air \nquality standards \u201crequisite to protect the public \nhealth\u201d \u201cfor a discrete set of pollutants\u201d based on \u201cthe \nlatest scientific knowledge.\u201d  Id. at 472-73.  In other \nwords, the statute was constitutional because Congress \nmade the crucial policy judgment\u2014that the public \nshould be protected from harmful pollutants\u2014 and then \nrelied on EPA to give effect to that judgment through \nthe application of its scientific expertise.11  See Gundy, \n588 U.S. at 166 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting) (explaining that \nthe \u201cmost important[]\u201d question in the intelligible prin-\nciple inquiry is whether \u201cCongress, and not the Execu-\ntive Branch, ma[d]e the policy judgments\u201d). \n \n11 The Court upheld the delegation only after deciding that the \nstatute in question \u201cunambiguously bar[red] cost considerations \nfrom the NAAQS-setting process.\u201d  Id. at 471; see also id. at 473-\n74 (noting the statute \u201cdid not permit economic costs to be consid-\nered\u201d). \n\n35a \n \nHere, in contrast, Congress did not delegate because \nFCC has some superior technical knowledge about the \noptimal amount of universal service funding.  No such \nknowledge exists because determining the ideal size of \na welfare program involves policy judgments, not tech-\nnical ones.  And under our Constitution, those judg-\nments usually are Congress\u2019s to make. \nIn fact, in every case where the Court has upheld a \ncongressional delegation of its prerogative to make sig-\nnificant policy judgments, there has been some special \njustification.  In Mistretta, for example, the Court con-\nsidered a congressional delegation of authority to Arti-\ncle III judges to promulgate sentencing guidelines.  \nFew things are more policy-laden than criminal sentenc-\ning decisions, but the Court found the delegation per-\nmissible because \u201cthe Judiciary always has played, and \ncontinues to play, [a role] in sentencing.\u201d  Mistretta, \n488 U.S. at 391; see also ibid. (\u201cJust as the rules of pro-\ncedure bind judges and courts in the proper manage-\nment of the cases before them, so the Guidelines bind \njudges and courts in the exercise of their uncontested \nresponsibility to pass sentence in criminal cases.  In \nother words, the Commission\u2019s functions, like this \nCourt\u2019s function in promulgating procedural rules, are \nclearly attendant to a central element of the historically \nacknowledged mission of the Judicial Branch.\u201d). \nSimilarly, in National Broadcasting Co. v. United \nStates, 319 U.S. 190 (1943), the Court upheld a delega-\ntion to FCC to regulate broadcasting \u201cas public conven-\nience, interest, or necessity requires.  . . .  \u201d  Id. at  \n214.  But licensing of broadcasting rests on the princi-\nple \u201cthat the public  . . .  own[s] the airwaves,\u201d and \nthat private people may use that resource only on terms \n\n36a \n \nthe government sets.

See, e.g., Yakus, 321 U.S. at 420 (upholding a del-\negation to the agency to fix the prices of commodities at \na level that \u201cwill be generally fair and equitable and will \neffectuate the purposes of the Act.\u201d  (citation omit-\nted)); Am.

SEC, 329 U.S. 90, 97 \n(1946) (upholding a delegation to SEC to modify the \nstructure of holding company systems so as to ensure \nthat they are not \u201cunduly or unnecessarily complicated\u201d \nand do not \u201cunfairly or inequitably distribute voting \npower among security holders.\u201d  (citation omitted)).  \nBut careful consideration reveals that the statutes con-\nsidered in all these cases limited agency discretion enough \nthat, at the very least, reviewing courts could \u201cascertain \nwhether the will of Congress ha[d] been obeyed.\u201d  Mis-\ntretta, 488 U.S. at 379 (quoting Yakus, 321 U.S. at 425-\n26). \nIn Yakus, for example, Congress directed the admin-\nistrator responsible for ensuring \u201cfair and equitable\u201d \nprices to \u201cascertain and give due consideration to the \nprices prevailing\u201d in a particular two-week period, and \nto make adjustments for relevant factors including \n\n38a \n \n\u201c[s]peculative fluctuations, general increases or de-\ncreases in costs of production, distribution, and trans-\nportation, and general increases or decreases in profits \nearned by sellers of the commodity or commodities, dur-\ning and subsequent to the year ended October 1, 1941.\u201d  \n321 U.S. at 421 (citation omitted).  It can hardly be con-\ntended that the executive wanted for legislative direc-\ntion under this statute, or that reviewing courts lacked \nworkable standards.  See id. at 426 (noting that \u201cthe \nstandards prescribed by the  . . .  Act\u201d were \u201csuffi-\nciently definite and precise to enable Congress, the \ncourts and the public to ascertain whether the Adminis-\ntrator, in fixing the designated prices, has conformed to \nthose standards\u201d).  Similarly in American Power & \nLight Co., the Court found that \u201ca veritable code of \nrules\u201d set out in other sections of the statute clarified \nthe ambiguities inherent in the phrases \u201cunduly or un-\nnecessarily complicate[d]\u201d and \u201cunfairly or inequitably \ndistribute[d]\u201d such that courts would have no trouble \ntesting SEC\u2019s policies against the law.  329 U.S. at 104- \n05. \nThe Court\u2019s other nondelegation precedents are in \naccord.  The statute considered in J.W.

Id. at 401; see also Gundy, 588 U.S. at \n163 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting) (noting that the statute \nmay have required the President to make \u201cintricate cal-\nculations, but it could be argued that Congress had \nmade all the relevant policy decisions, and the Court\u2019s \nreference to an \u2018intelligible principle\u2019 was just another \nway to describe the traditional rule that Congress may \nleave the executive the responsibility to find facts and \n\n39a \n \nfill up details.\u201d).  And the term \u201cpublic interest\u201d in  \n\u00a7 407 of the Transportation Act of 1920 was shorthand \nfor a congressional instruction to the Interstate Com-\nmerce Commission to ensure that proposed railroad \nconsolidation would not result in deteriorating service \nquality or unreasonable or discriminatory rates\u2014an in-\nstruction with discernible content in light of the common \nlaw of common carriers.

And the statute considered in \nTouby \u201cmeaningfully constrain[ed] the Attorney Gen-\neral\u2019s discretion\u201d because it directed the Attorney Gen-\neral to ban drugs only after making a factual determina-\ntion that there was a history of significant abuse that \nthreatened the public health.  See 500 U.S. at 166; see \nalso Gundy, 588 U.S. at 166 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting) \n(noting that in Touby the Court \u201cstressed all [the statu-\ntory] constraints on the Attorney General\u2019s discretion  \n. . .  to indicate that the statute supplied an \u2018intelligi-\nble principle\u2019 because it assigned an essentially fact-\nfinding responsibility to the executive.\u201d  (emphasis in \noriginal)).  And the statute considered in Lichter, 334 \nU.S. 742\u2014which authorized the executive to recoup \u201cex-\ncessive profits\u201d on wartime government contracts\u2014was \n\n40a \n \nlikewise judicially workable.

Unlike delega-\ntions implicating special agency expertise, \u00a7 254 dele-\ngates to FCC the power to make important policy judg-\nments, and to make them while wholly immunized from \nthe oversight Congress exercises through the regular \nappropriations process.  Unlike delegations implicat-\ning the power to impose criminal sentences, taxation has \nalways been an exclusively legislative function.  Unlike \n \n12 Moreover, as we have noted, context matters to the intelligible-\nprinciple inquiry.  So assuming arguendo Lichter blessed a dele-\ngation more sweeping than any other (we think it did not), it is \nsurely relevant that the Court emphasized that the statute in ques-\ntion came about because of the necessities of war, \u201csprang from \n[Congress\u2019s] war powers,\u201d and operated only for \u201cthe duration of \nthe war or  . . .  a short time thereafter.\u201d  Id. at 755; 787.  As \nthe Court explained, because \u201c[t]he power to wage war is the power \nto wage war successfully,\u201d \u201c[r]easonable regulations to safeguard \nthe resources upon which we depend for military success must be \nregarded as being within the powers confided to Congress to ena-\nble it to prosecute a successful war.\u201d  Id. at 780-81.  The Panama \nRefining Court similarly deemed the wartime posture of certain \nbroad delegations meaningful to the delegation inquiry because the \nPresident himself has war powers \u201ccognate to the conduct by him \nof the foreign relations of the government.\u201d  293 U.S. at 422. \n\n41a \n \nthe power to impose conditions on the use of public prop-\nerty, taxation involves the conversion of private prop-\nerty.  And unlike other congressional delegations im-\nplicating core legislative functions, \u00a7 254 is a hollow shell \nthat Congress created for FCC to fill\u2014so amorphous \nthat no reviewing court could ever possibly invalidate \nany FCC action taken in its name.13 \n \n13 Section 254 also implicates the taxing power, which makes the \nnondelegation concerns it raises especially salient.  See Nat\u2019l Ca-\nble, 415 U.S. at 341 (\u201cIt would be such a sharp break with our tra-\nditions to conclude that Congress had bestowed on a federal agency \nthe taxing power that we read [the relevant statute] narrowly as \nauthorizing not a \u2018tax\u2019 but a \u2018fee.\u2019\u201d).  That is because limitations on \nthe taxing power have long been the mechanism through which the \npeople curb the excesses of unelected power.  See The Federalist \nNo. 58 (J. Madison) (\u201c[The House], in a word, hold[s] the purse that \npowerful instrument by which we behold, in the history of the Brit-\nish Constitution, an infant and humble representation of the people \ngradually enlarging the sphere of its activity and importance, and \nfinally reducing, as far as it seems to have wished, all the over-\ngrown prerogatives of the other branches of the government.\u201d). \n For that reason, the framers through the Origination Clause \ntook special care to ensure that the taxing power remained inti-\nmately connected with the people.  See U.S. CONST. art. I, \u00a7 7, cl.1 \n(\u201cAll Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Rep-\nresentatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with Amend-\nments as on other Bills.\u201d); 1 THE RECORDS OF THE FEDERAL CON-\nVENTION of 1787 544 (Max Farrand ed., 2d ed. 1937) (George Mason) \n(\u201c[T]he consideration which weighed with the Committee [when \ndrafting the Origination Clause] was that the [House] would be the \nimmediate representatives of the people, the [Senate] would not.\u201d).  \nIn fact, \u201cvesting the origination power with the House was an inte-\ngral part of the deal that resolved the conflict over congressional ap-\nportionment: seats in the Senate would not be apportioned based on \npopulation, but only the House of Representatives would have the \npower to initiate legislation that raises or spends money.\u201d  Kroto-\nszynksi, Jr., Reconsidering the Nondelegation Doctrine, supra, at \n \n\n42a \n \nWe therefore have grave concerns about \u00a7 254\u2019s con-\nstitutionality under the Supreme Court\u2019s nondelegation \nprecedents.  See Gundy, 588 U.S. at 136 (plurality op.) \n(noting that the Court \u201cwould face a nondelegation ques-\ntion\u201d if the statutory provision at issue had \u201cgrant[ed] \nthe Attorney General plenary power to determine [the \nstatute\u2019s] applicability to pre-Act offenders\u2014to require \nthem to register, or not, as she sees fit, and to change \nher policy for any reason and at any time\u201d (emphasis \nadded) (citation omitted)).  Nevertheless, we need not \nhold the agency action before us unconstitutional on that \nground alone because the unprecedented nature of the \ndelegation combined with other factors is enough to hold \nit unlawful.  See infra, Part III.D. \nC. \nThe Q1 2022 USF Tax is not only difficult to square \nwith the Supreme Court\u2019s public nondelegation prece-\ndents.  It was also formulated by private entities.  \nThat raises independent but equally serious questions \nabout its compatibility with Article I, \u00a7 1, which requires \n\u201c[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested \nin a Congress.\u201d  We (1) explain that the scope of FCC\u2019s \ndelegation to private entities may violate the Legislative \nVesting Clause by allowing private entities to exercise \n \n252.  Benjamin Franklin, among others, noted that \u201cthe two clauses, \nthe originating of money bills, and the equality of votes in the Senate, \n[are] essentially connected by the compromise which had been \nagreed to.\u201d  2 THE RECORDS OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION, su-\npra, at 233. \n So the Constitution\u2019s original meaning would seem to compel a \nmore restrictive test for delegations of the taxing power.  Never-\ntheless, the Supreme Court has declined to apply heightened scru-\ntiny to tax-related delegations, see Skinner, 490 U.S. at 223, and we \nare not authorized to depart from that holding. \n\n43a \n \ngovernment power.  Then we (2) explain that even if \nFCC\u2019s delegation could be constitutionally justified, \nFCC may have violated the Legislative Vesting Clause \nby delegating government power to private entities \nwithout express congressional authorization. \n1. \na. \nThe Supreme Court has held Congress has broad dis-\ncretion to empower executive agencies to \u201cexecute\u201d the \nlaw.  See City of Arlington v. FCC, 569 U.S. 290, 304 \nn.4 (2013).  \u201cWhen it comes to private entities, how-\never, there is not even a fig leaf of constitutional justifi-\ncation.  Private entities are not vested with legislative \nPowers.  Nor are they vested with the executive \nPower, which belongs to the President.\u201d  Amtrak II, \n575 U.S. at 62 (Alito, J., concurring) (quotation and cita-\ntions omitted).  So it is clear that delegations to private \nentities raise constitutional concerns entirely distinct \nfrom delegations to the executive. \nOnly four times has the Supreme Court considered \nwhether a delegation to private entities violates Article \nI\u2019s Vesting Clause.14 \nFirst, in Schechter Poultry, the Court considered a \nconstitutional challenge to the National Industrial Re-\n \n14 The parties in Amtrak II raised a private delegation challenge, \nbut the Court did not reach it because it determined that, for rele-\nvant purposes, Amtrak was a governmental entity.  See 575 U.S. \nat 55.  The Court has also several times considered whether state \ndelegations of legislative power to private entities violated due pro-\ncess, see Paul J. Larkin, The Private Delegation Doctrine, 73 Fla. \nL. Rev. 31, 45-47 (2021), but those cases present a question differ-\nent from the one before us. \n\n44a \n \ncovery Act (\u201cNIRA\u201d) of 1933, 48 Stat. 195.  See 295 \nU.S. at 519-21.  That statute delegated to trade or in-\ndustrial groups the authority to develop codes defining \n\u201cunfair method[s] of competition.\u201d  Id. at 521 n.4 (quo-\ntation omitted).  If the codes were approved by the \nPresident, they were to become law under \u201csuch excep-\ntions to and exemptions from the provisions of such \ncode, as the President in his discretion deem[ed] neces-\nsary to effectuate the policy\u201d of the NIRA.  Ibid.  The \nCourt held that the statute was unconstitutional.  In \npart, it reasoned the idea that \u201cCongress could delegate \nits legislative authority to trade or industrial associa-\ntions or groups so as to empower them to enact the laws \nthey deem to be wise and beneficent for the rehabilita-\ntion and expansion of their trade or industries,\u201d or that \n\u201ctrade or industrial associations or groups be consti-\ntuted legislative bodies for that purpose because such \nassociations or groups are familiar with the problems of \ntheir enterprises\u201d was \u201cutterly inconsistent with the \nconstitutional prerogatives and duties of Congress.\u201d  \nId. at 537. \nThe next year, in Carter v. Carter Coal Company, 298 \nU.S. 238, 278 (1936), the Court considered a delegation \nchallenge to the Bituminous Coal Conservation Act of \n1935, 49 Stat. 991 (repealed 1937).  That statute au-\nthorized the district board in local coal districts (the \n\u201ccode authority\u201d) to adopt a code that included agreed-\nupon minimum prices for coal. Carter Coal, 298 U.S. at \n282-83.  It also allowed an agreement between produc-\ners of more than two-thirds of the annual tonnage of coal \nand a majority of mine workers to set industry-wide \nminimum wage and maximum working-hour agree-\nments.  Id. at 283-84.  Both the minimum price codes \nand the labor codes bound producers\u2014i.e., obtained le-\n\n45a \n \ngal force\u2014without approval by any federal official.  Id. \nat 282, 284.  The Court explained the statute amounted \nto \u201cdelegation in its most obnoxious form\u201d because it \npurported to delegate regulatory power not \u201cto an offi-\ncial or an official body, presumptively disinterested,\u201d \nbut rather \u201cto private persons whose interests  . . .  \noften are adverse\u201d to those whom the statute authorized \nthem to regulate.  Id. at 311.  That, the Court held, \nwas \u201can intolerable and unconstitutional interference \nwith personal liberty and private property.\u201d  Ibid.15 \nIn Currin v. Wallace, 306 U.S. 1, 5-6 (1939), the Court \nconsidered a delegation challenge to the Tobacco In-\nspection Act of 1935, 49 Stat. 731 which authorized the \nSecretary of Agriculture to designate markets in which \nno tobacco could be sold unless it had \u201cbeen inspected \nand certified by an authorized representative of the Sec-\nretary according to the established standards.\u201d One of \nthe bases for the challenge was that the Secretary could \nnot designate a market unless two-thirds of the growers \nvoting at a prescribed referendum favored the designa-\ntion.  See Currin, 306 U.S. at 6, 15.  But the producers \nhad no power to designate the markets in which classifi-\ncation would be required; only the Secretary could do \nthat.  Nor did the statute even provide that the produc-\ners would help craft regulations.  So unlike the private \nbodies in Carter Coal, the tobacco producers had no \n \n15 The Court did not clearly specify which constitutional provision \n\u2014the Legislative Vesting Clause or the Fifth Amendment Due \nProcess Clause\u2014the statute offended.  See id. at 310-12; see also \nNat\u2019l Horsemen\u2019s Benevolent & Protective Ass\u2019n v. Black, 53 F.4th \n869, 881 n.23 (5th Cir. 2022).  But because the relevant portion of \nthe Carter Coal cited Schechter Poultry, a Vesting Clause case, \nalongside Due Process cases, the Court presumably held the dele-\ngation was unlawful on both grounds. \n\n46a \n \npower to \u201cmake the law and force it upon a minority.\u201d  \nId. at 15-16 (citation omitted).  Congress merely gave \nthem the ability to prevent certain regulations from tak-\ning effect.  See ibid.  The Court accordingly rejected \nthe challenge on the ground that the statute did not del-\negate any legislative power to private entities.  Ibid. \nFinally, in Sunshine Anthracite Coal Company v. \nAdkins, 310 U.S. 381, 387 (1940), the Court considered a \nprivate delegation challenge to The Bituminous Coal Act \nof 1937, 50 Stat. 72 (repealed 1966), a revised version of \nthe statute the Court held unlawful in Carter Coal.  \nCongress\u2019s most important revision was to relegate the \ncode authorities from lawmakers to \u201caid[s]\u201d subject to \nthe \u201cpervasive surveillance and authority\u201d of the Na-\ntional Bituminous Coal Commission.  Sunshine An-\nthracite, 310 U.S. at 388.  Under the revised statute, \ncode authorities could \u201cpropose\u201d minimum prices, but \ntheir proposals were legal nullities until they were ex-\npressly \u201capproved, disapproved, or modified\u201d by the \nCoal Commission.  Ibid.  Thus, the Court concluded \nthat the Commission, \u201cnot the code authorities, deter-\nmine[d] [coal] prices,\u201d id. at 399, and it therefore held \nthat the statute did not unconstitutionally delegate gov-\nernment power to private entities. \nLower courts have discerned from these cases the \n\u201ccardinal constitutional principle [] that federal power \ncan be wielded only by the federal government.\u201d  \nBlack, 53 F.4th at 872.  Private delegations are thus \nconstitutional only on three conditions.  First, govern-\nment officials must have final decision-making author-\nity.  See Larkin, The Private Delegation Doctrine,  \nsupra, at 50-51 (noting that in every case in which the \nSupreme Court has upheld a private delegation, \u201cthe \n\n47a \n \nlaw[] at issue  . . .  left final decision-making author-\nity in the hands of a government official\u201d).  Second, \nagencies must actually exercise their authority rather \nthan \u201creflexively rubber stamp [work product] prepared \nby others.\u201d  Sierra Club v. Lynn, 502 F.2d 43, 59 (5th \nCir. 1974); see State v. Rettig, 987 F.3d 518, 531 (5th Cir. \n2021), cert. denied, Tex. v. Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, \n142 S. Ct. 1308 (2022) (\u201cA federal agency may not abdi-\ncate its statutory duties by delegating them to a private \nentity.\u201d  (quotation and citation omitted)).16  And third, \nthe private actors must always remain subject to the \n\u201cpervasive surveillance and authority\u201d of some person \nor entity lawfully vested with government power.  Sun-\nshine Anthracite, 310 U.S. at 388. \nIn light of these strictures on private delegations, we \nheld unconstitutional a statute that vested a private en-\ntity with the power to make rules regulating an industry \nwhere those rules were subject only to limited agency \nreview.  See Black, 53 F.4th at 884-89.  And the D.C. \nCircuit similarly held unconstitutional a statute that em-\npowered Amtrak to work jointly with the Federal Rail-\nroad Administration to develop binding railroad perfor-\nmance standards because the statute did not vest FRA \nwith complete regulatory control.  See Amtrak I, 721 \nF.3d at 670-74, vacated and remanded sub nom. Amtrak \n \n16  Lynn arose under the National Environmental Policy Act \n(\u201cNEPA\u201d), not the Constitution.  But Rettig repeatedly cited Lynn \nto expound the level of control agencies must retain over private \nactors wielding governmental power for constitutional purposes. \nRettig, 987 F.3d at 532.  The central question in Lynn was wheth-\ner an agency bore ultimate responsibility for work product pre-\npared by a private entity, see 502 F.2d at 59, which is required not \nonly by NEPA but also by the Legislative Vesting Clause, see, e.g., \nBlack, 53 F.4th at 881. \n\n48a \n \nII, 575 U.S. 43; see also Black, 53 F.4th at 889-90 (rely-\ning on Amtrak I\u200a). \nIn contrast, where courts have deemed delegations to \nprivate entities constitutional, they have uniformly em-\nphasized the agency\u2019s actual decision-making authority \nand control.  For example, when the Third Circuit ap-\nproved the National Association of Securities Dealers\u2019 \nrole in securities regulation, it explained industry self-\nregulation raises \u201cserious constitutional challenges.\u201d  \nTodd & Co. v. SEC, 557 F.2d 1008, 1014 (3d Cir. 1977). \nAccordingly, the Court held securities self-regulation \nwas constitutional only after emphasizing that SEC was \nobliged to \u201cinsure fair treatment of those disciplined by\u201d \nNASD.  Ibid.  It also stressed that SEC was statuto-\nrily required to review NASD orders, make de novo \nfindings, and come to an \u201cindependent decision on\u201d se-\ncurities\u2019 violations and penalties.  See id. at 1012; see \nalso id. at 1012-13 (\u201c[NASD\u2019s] rules and its disciplinary \nactions were subject to full review by the S.E.C., a \nwholly public body, which must base its decision on its \nown findings.\u201d  (emphasis added)).  Similarly, when \nwe approved a private entity\u2019s role in drafting an envi-\nronmental impact statement, we emphasized that \u201cthe \napplicable federal agency [bore] the responsibility for \nthe ultimate work product\u201d and \u201cindependently per-\nform[ed] its reviewing, analytical and judgmental func-\ntions.\u201d  Lynn, 502 F.2d at 59 (quotation and citation \nomitted); see also Rettig, 987 F.3d at 531-32 (citing Lynn \nin an Art. I, \u00a7 1 challenge). \nb. \nFCC has delegated government power\u2014the power to \ndictate the size of the universal service contribution \namount, which controls the size of a tax levied on Amer-\n\n49a \n \nican consumers\u2014to USAC and private telecommunica-\ntions carriers.  That delegation is lawful only if FCC (1) \nhas final decision-making authority, (2) actually exer-\ncises that authority, and (3) exercises \u201cpervasive sur-\nveillance and authority\u201d over the private entities exer-\ncising power in its name.  Black, 53 F.4th at 884 (quot-\ning Sunshine Anthracite, 310 U.S. at 388). \nFCC\u2019s subdelegation of its taxing power violates this \ntest in two ways.  The first problem is that FCC regu-\nlations provide that USAC\u2019s projections take legal effect \nwithout formal FCC approval. \n See 47 C.F.R.  \n\u00a7 54.709(a)(3).  FCC has, in effect, given private enti-\nties the final say with respect to the size of the USF Tax.  \nThat FCC retains discretion to revise the proposed con-\ntribution amount, see ibid., is insufficient.  Congress \ncould not say:  \u201cThe defense budget is whatever Lock-\nheed Martin wants it to be, unless Congress intervenes \nto revise it.\u201d  To make law, Congress must affirma-\ntively adopt the statutory text, pass it bicamerally, and \npresent it to the President for signature.  INS v. \nChadha, 462 U.S. 919, 959 (1983).  Legislation requires \naction not acquiescence.  Similarly, while FCC may so-\nlicit advice from USAC and private carriers, it must af-\nfirmatively act to give legal effect to that advice because \nit alone has constitutional authority to execute 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254. \nThe second problem is that FCC does not appear to \n\u201cindependently perform[] its reviewing, analytical and \njudgmental functions\u201d with respect to the privately sup-\nplied universal service contribution amount.  Rettig, \n987 F.3d at 532 (quoting Lynn, 502 F.2d at 59).  FCC \nhas not pointed us to anything that suggests it even \nchecks USAC\u2019s work.  Instead, it appears to \u201creflex-\n\n50a \n \nive[ly] rubber stamp\u201d whatever contribution amount \nUSAC proposes.  Lynn, 502 F.2d at 59.  The record \nbefore us shows that, before this litigation started, FCC \nnever made a single substantive change to the contribu-\ntion amounts proposed by USAC.  See supra, at 6 & \nn.1.17 \nThat is a de facto abdication.  And when an agency \nde facto abdicates to a private entity its responsibility to \nmake governmental decisions, that entity becomes more \nthan a mere \u201caid\u201d to the agency.  See Black, 53 F.4th at \n881 (quoting Sunshine Anthracite, 310 U.S. at 388).  \nThe private company becomes a lawmaker in its own \nright.  So de jure approval alone is not enough.  If \nFCC is going to rely on a non-governmental actor to \nsupply a revenue requirement that dictates the size of a \ntax levied on American consumers, it must at the very \nleast do something to demonstrate that it applied its in-\ndependent judgment. \nc. \nThe Government\u2019s principal counterargument is that \nFCC\u2014not USAC\u2014is exercising governmental power.  \nIts argument goes like this:  FCC sets out detailed reg-\nulations specifying who is eligible for what kinds of uni-\nversal service subsidies.  Private companies merely \nproject the costs they will incur supplying the FCC-\nspecified subsidized services and report that infor-\nmation to USAC.  And then USAC merely aggregates \n \n17 Even if FCC wanted to change USAC\u2019s proposals, it is not at \nall clear it could.  Petitioners contend, and FCC does not dispute, \nthat the \u201capproval\u201d process for USAC\u2019s proposals plays out just \ndays before the new quarter begins.  With such a short time win-\ndow, it appears FCC has no real choice but to accept USAC\u2019s pro-\nposed figures. \n\n51a \n \nthat information into a contribution amount, which FCC \nturns into the contribution factor that is levied on tele-\ncommunications revenues as a USF Tax.  FCC regula-\ntions even preclude USAC from making policy.  So in \ndetermining the contribution amount, which directly \ncontrols the size of the tax levied on American telecom-\nmunications consumers, USAC and private carriers per-\nform a simple, ministerial task\u2014a mere \u201cfact gathering \nfunction for the FCC.\u201d  FCC EB Br. 56 (quotation \nomitted). \nBut FCC obfuscates how the universal service sau-\nsage is really made.  FCC would have us believe its uni-\nversal service policy necessarily dictates the size of the \ncontribution amount, and so FCC really controls the size \nof the USF Tax.  But that cannot be right because USF \ndisbursements often do not comply with FCC policy.  \nSee supra, Part I.C.  Instead, large swaths of USF \nfunds\u2014perhaps at one point close to one-quarter\u2014are \ndisbursed to ineligible recipients.  See, e.g., THE HIGH-\nCOST PROGRAM, supra, at 2.  That FCC sets universal \nservice policy obviously does nothing to limit the reve-\nnue FCC allows private entities to exact from consum-\ners to fund payments made in violation of FCC\u2019s uni-\nversal service policy. \nPut differently, FCC policy would dictate the contri-\nbution amount only if it in fact dictated how private com-\npanies raised and spent USF monies.  The problem is \nthat FCC has abdicated responsibility for ensuring com-\npliance to the very entities whose universal service de-\nmand projections dictate the size of the contribution \namount.  See, e.g., FCC\u2019s LIFELINE PROGRAM, supra, \nat executive summary page (noting that FCC \u201crelies on \nover 2,000 Eligible Telecommunication Carriers that are \n\n52a \n \nLifeline providers to implement key program functions, \nsuch as verifying subscriber eligibility,\u201d which is prob-\nlematic because \u201ccompanies may have financial incen-\ntives to enroll as many customers as possible\u201d); FCC\u2019s \nE-RATE PROGRAM, supra, at 21-22 (noting that telecom-\nmunications service providers have opportunities to \n\u201cmake misrepresentations  . . .  during the funding \nphase\u201d that \u201cmay not be discovered due to the self- \ncertifying nature of the program\u201d). \nMoreover, the entity most responsible for snuffing \nout wasteful or fraudulent disbursements\u2014USAC\u2014is \nrun almost entirely by stakeholders who stand to benefit \nfinancially when universal service subsidies grow.  See \nLeadership, UNIVERSAL SERV. ADMIN. CO., supra; see \nalso FCC\u2019s E-RATE PROGRAM, supra, at 15 (noting that \nFCC relies on USAC to ensure compliance carrier com-\npliance with FCC rules).  And that is no accident. \nUSAC is run by self-interested stakeholders because \nFCC regulations require it.  See 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.703(b).  \nFCC mandates that nine of USAC\u2019s nineteen directors \nrepresent companies in the telecommunications indus-\ntry who are compensated by the very same USF funds \nthey raise.  See id. \u00a7 54.703(b)(1)-(6).  It mandates that an-\nother seven represent the schools, libraries, health care \nproviders, and low-income consumers who are direct re-\ncipients of USF funds.  See id. \u00a7 54.703(b)(7)-(10). \nBecause the telecommunications industry polices its \nown compliance with FCC universal service policy, and \nresponsibility for monitoring the industry falls most \nheavily on a board composed of industry representatives \nand consumer groups with a direct financial interest in \nthe size of USF taxes, private entities have a far more \nimportant and discretionary role in determining the size \n\n53a \n \nof the contribution amount (which controls the level of \nuniversal service taxation) than FCC would have you be-\nlieve.  For example, a carrier could (intentionally or un-\nintentionally) project and then supply USF-subsidized \nservice costing twenty-five percent more than its USF-\nsubsidized service would cost if it strictly complied with \nFCC rules.  And FCC offers us zero reason to think it \nwould even discover the discrepancy\u2014let alone that \nFCC would do anything about it.  FCC has in effect \nsaid to carriers:  \u201cHere is our universal service policy \nand a blank check.  We\u2019re not going to pay any atten-\ntion to what you put in the dollar box.  We know you \nhave financial incentives to juice the number, but we \ntrust you\u2019ll follow our policy to the letter anyways.  \nJust fill it out however you see fit, take it to the bank, \nand the money will be drawn from the accounts of Amer-\nican telecommunications consumers.\u201d  We do not doubt \nthat most of the industry is staffed by individuals of the \nutmost integrity, but we cannot agree that private enti-\nties are no more than ministerial bean counters when it \ncomes to setting the USF Tax. \nMoreover, even if we put the compliance issue to one \nside, we would still disagree that private companies have \nmerely \u201cministerial\u201d control over the contribution amount. \nAs we have noted, FCC\u2019s counterargument turns on the \nCommission\u2019s nominal control over universal service \npolicy.  But setting a policy is not the same as allocat-\ning funds to execute that policy.  That much is evident \nfrom the constitutional requirement that Congress ap-\npropriate money to execute the government programs it \nestablishes.  See U.S. CONST. ART. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 7.  Thus, \nFCC\u2019s argument fails because it impermissibly col-\nlapses universal service funding decisions into universal \nservice policy decisions.  The decision of how much \n\n54a \n \nmoney should be set aside to execute FCC\u2019s universal \nservice policies\u2014the very decision FCC has delegated \nto USAC and private carriers\u2014is an independent deci-\nsion that requires independent judgment.  And surely \ndiscretion inheres in decisions about how much money \nto allocate to a massive federal welfare program.  See \nGaines v. Thompson, 74 U.S. (7 Wall.) 347, 353 (1868) \n(\u201cA ministerial duty  . . .  is one in respect to which \nnothing is left to discretion.\u201d  (quotation omitted)).  \nSo even if we thought FCC correctly described the role \nof private entities, we would still conclude that dictating \nthe contribution amount is an exercise of government \npower. \n* * * \nFCC has not delegated to private entities a trivial, \nfact-gathering role.  It has delegated the power to dic-\ntate the amount of money that will be exacted from tel-\necommunications carriers (and American consumers in \nturn) to promote \u201cuniversal service.\u201d  In other words, \nit has delegated the taxing power.  And the delegation \nis not even \u201cto an official or an official body, presump-\ntively disinterested,\u201d but rather to private persons \nvested with no government power and with interests \nthat \u201coften are adverse\u201d to those whom they are taxing.  \nCarter Coal, 298 U.S. at 311; see also Ass\u2019n of Am. Rail-\nroads v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Transp. (\u201cAmtrak III\u201d), 821 F.3d \n19, 29 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (\u201cDelegating legislative authority \nto official bodies is inoffensive because we presume \nthose bodies are disinterested, that their loyalties lie \nwith the public good, not their private gain.  But here, \nthe majority producers may be and often are adverse to \nthe interests of others in the same business.\u201d  (citation \nand quotation omitted)).  We accordingly have serious \n\n55a \n \ntrouble squaring FCC\u2019s subdelegation with Article I,  \n\u00a7 1 of the Constitution.18 \n2. \nEven if the Constitution does not categorically forbid \nFCC\u2019s delegation to USAC and private telecommunica-\ntions carriers, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254 does not authorize it.  \nAnd there is no precedent establishing that federal \nagencies may subdelegate powers in the absence of stat-\nutory authorization.  To the contrary, the only Su-\npreme Court cases blessing private delegations involved \nexplicit statutory authorizations. \na. \nAt the Founding, the maxim that delegata potestas \nnon potest delegari\u2014no delegated powers can be fur-\nther delegated\u2014was widely accepted.  The maxim has \nits roots in the civil law.  See Patrick W. Duff & Horace \nE. Whiteside, Delegata Potestas Non Potest Delegari:  \nA Maxim of American Constitutional Law, 14 COR-\nNELL L.Q. 168, 171 (1929).  Lord Coke enshrined the \nmaxim as a common law doctrine.  See id. at 170-71 (ci-\ntations omitted).  And the doctrine endured through \n \n18 JUDGE NEWSOM recently expressed skepticism that the private \nentities involved in USF may constitutionally exercise the power \nFCC delegated to them.  See Consumers\u2019 Rsch., 88 F.4th at 932 \n(Newsom, J., concurring).  But JUDGE NEWSOM voted to deny a \npetition for review that is almost identical to the one before us be-\ncause in his view, these private entities exercise executive rather \nthan legislative power, and petitioners did not raise an Article II \nchallenge.  Ibid.  With utmost respect to our distinguished col-\nleague, private entities do play a legislative role in the USF be-\ncause their projections directly control the size of USF tax rates, \nand setting tax rates is unquestionably a legislative function.  See \nsupra, Part III.B. \n\n56a \n \nthe founding generation, as evidenced by treatises of the \ngreat 19th-century scholars.  Samuel Livermore, for \nexample, noted that \u201c[a]n authority given to one person \ncannot in general be delegated by him to another; for \nbeing a personal trust and confidence it is not in its na-\nture transmissible, and if there be such a power to one \nperson, to exercise his judgment and discretion, he can-\nnot say, that the trust and confidence reposed in him \nshall be exercised at the discretion of another person.\u201d  \nA TREATISE ON THE LAW OF PRINCIPAL AND AGENT AND \nOF SALES BY AUCTION 54 (1818).  Likewise, James Kent \nwrote that \u201c[a]n agent, ordinarily and without express \nauthority, has not power to employ a sub-agent to do the \nbusiness, without the knowledge or consent of his prin-\nciple.  The maxim is, that delegatus non potest dele-\ngare, and the agency is generally a personal trust and \nconfidence which cannot be delegated.\u201d  2 COMMEN-\nTARIES ON AMERICAN LAW 496 (1827).  And Joseph \nStory agreed, explaining that \u201c[o]ne, who has a bare \npower or authority from another to do an act, must exe-\ncute it himself, and cannot delegate his authority to an-\nother; for this being a trust or confidence reposed in him \npersonally, it cannot be assigned to a stranger, whose \nability and integrity might not be known to the principal \nor who, if known, might not be selected by him for such \na purpose.\u201d  COMMENTARIES ON THE LAW OF AGENCY, \nAS A BRANCH OF COMMERCIAL AND MARITIME JURIS-\nPRUDENCE 66-67 (1844). \nAs with most rules, this one had exceptions.  Com-\nmon lawyers assumed that ministerial tasks could be \nsubdelegated.  See GARY LAWSON & GUY SEIDMAN, \u201cA \nGREAT POWER OF ATTORNEY\u201d:  UNDERSTANDING THE \nFIDUCIARY CONSTITUTION 115 (2017).  And a fiduciary \n\n57a \n \ndocument could specifically authorize subdelegations of \ndelegated authority.  Ibid. \nBut as a general matter, \u201c[t]he founding-era rule \nagainst subdelegation of delegated agency authority is \nas clearly established as any proposition of law can be \nestablished.\u201d  Id. at 114.  And it was not merely a \nproposition of agency law.  In fact, the Supreme Court \nonce noted that the maxim \u201chas had wider application in \nthe construction of our federal and state Constitutions \nthan it has in private law.\u201d  J.W. Hampton, 276 U.S. at \n405-06; see also Duff & Whiteside, Delegata Potestas \nNon Potest Delegari, supra, at 175 (\u201c[I]n cases which \ninvolve a supposed delegation to an independent board \nor commission, as well as those where the delegation is \nto the executive or judiciary, the maxim delegata \npotestas non potest delegari, or its English equivalent, \nhas been the chief reliance of the courts, and has at-\ntained in their eyes the dignity of a principle of consti-\ntutional law.\u201d). \nSo the Founders\u2019 law prohibited unauthorized sub-\ndelegations of non-ministerial delegated authority, and \nthe Supreme Court has recognized that as a constitu-\ntional principle.  See J.W. Hampton, 276 U.S. at 405-\n06; cf. Gundy, 588 U.S. at 135 (plurality op.) (\u201cArticle I \nof the Constitution provides that \u2018[a]ll legislative Powers \nherein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the \nUnited States.\u2019 \u00a7 1.  Accompanying that assignment of \npower to Congress is a bar on its further delegation.\u201d).  \nWe think the clear implication is that the Constitution \nimposes upon federal agencies\u2014acting as agents of the \npeople\u2019s representatives in Congress\u2014a duty to wield \ndelegated power unless Congress authorizes subdelega-\ntion or the subdelegation involves no more than ministe-\n\n58a \n \nrial tasks.  In other words, \u201cCongress may formalize [a \nlimited] role [for] private parties\u201d in executing its laws, \nAmtrak I, 721 F.3d at 671 (emphasis added) (citing Sun-\nshine Anthracite, 310 U.S. at 388), but agencies may not. \nb. \nThis rule does not just accord with law at the Found-\ning; it also accords with Supreme Court precedent. \nThe Court has emphasized the \u201cvital constitutional \nprinciple\u201d that \u201c[l]iberty requires accountability.\u201d  \nAmtrak II, 575 U.S. at 57 (Alito, J., concurring).  Every \nexecutive branch official is in some way accountable to \nthe people because every executive branch official may \nbe removed\u2014for good cause at least\u2014by the President, \nwho is himself \u201cthe most democratic and politically ac-\ncountable official in Government.\u201d  Seila L. LLC v. \nCFPB, 591 U.S. 197, 224 (2020).  Private persons, in \ncontrast, may not be removed by the President because \nprivate persons do not wield any portion of \u201cthe execu-\ntive Power\u201d our Constitution vests \u201cin a President of the \nUnited States of America.\u201d  U.S. CONST. art. II, \u00a7 1, cl. \n1.  There is no reason to lightly infer that Congress in-\ntends to insulate law execution from democratic ac-\ncountability in this way.19 \n \n19 Deciding who should exercise governmental power can be as \nimportant as deciding whether governmental power should be del-\negated in the first place.  If it were not, we would not care so \ndeeply about Presidential elections.  So democratic accountability \nis frustrated when decisions about who should exercise governmen-\ntal power are made by bureaucrats\u2014whose connection to the peo-\nple is real but highly attenuated\u2014rather than Congress, whose \nmembers are directly \u201caccountable to [their] constituents through \nregular popular elections.\u201d  Jarkesy, 34 F.4th at 459 (citation \nomitted). \n\n59a \n \nIn accordance with these principles, both Supreme \nCourt cases authorizing private entities to wield any-\nthing like government power involved express authori-\nzations from Congress.  The Tobacco Inspection Act \nconsidered in Currin expressly provided that regula-\ntions would take effect only with the support of two-\nthirds of the tobacco growers in the relevant market.  \nSee 306 U.S. at 6, 15.  And the Bituminous Coal Act \nconsidered in Sunshine Anthracite created the very pri-\nvate boards that proposed minimum prices and labor \ncodes to the Coal Commission.  See 310 U.S. at 387-88 \n(noting that the statute provided for \u201c[s]ome twenty dis-\ntrict boards of code members  . . .  which are to oper-\nate as an aid to the Commission\u201d and \u201cspecifie[d] in de-\ntail the methods of their organization and operation, the \nscope of their functions, and the jurisdiction of the Com-\nmission over them.\u201d).20 \nc. \nSection 254, by contrast, makes no mention of the fact \nthat private entities might be responsible for determin-\ning the size of the tax FCC levies on American consum-\ners.  It does not even mention USAC, a Delaware cor-\nporation FCC established without congressional author-\nization. \nWhen asked at oral argument to identify the portion \nof \u00a7 254 that authorizes FCC to subdelegate administra-\ntion of the universal service contribution mechanism to \nprivate entities, the Government\u2019s counsel could point \n \n20 Likewise the Maloney Act, which the Third Circuit considered \nin Todd & Co., specifically authorized registered organizations to \nself-regulate over-the-counter securities markets.  See 557 F.2d \nat 1012. \n\n60a \n \nonly to subsection \u00a7 254(b)(5).  See Oral Arg. at 46:40-\n48:55.  That subsection directs FCC to establish \n\u201cmechanisms to preserve and advance universal ser-\nvice.\u201d  \u00a7 254(b)(5).  But a directive to establish \u201cmech-\nanisms\u201d plainly does not imply that those \u201cmechanisms\u201d \nmay be controlled by a private, non-governmental entity \nincorporated by FCC without any involvement from \nCongress. \nIn fact, \u00a7 254(b)(5) seems to suggest precisely the op-\nposite.  Rather than directing FCC to establish private \nmechanisms, it specifically instructs FCC to establish \n\u201cFederal and State mechanisms,\u201d ibid., which indicates \nCongress intended to make government entities respon-\nsible for administering universal service programs.  So \nsubsection (b)(5) is unavailing. \nThe closest \u00a7 254 comes to contemplating that a non-\ngovernmental entity might play any role in executing \nthe statute is to incorporate by reference some of the \npreexisting regulations governing the Lifeline Program.  \nSee \u00a7 254(\u200aj) (\u201cNothing in this section shall affect the col-\nlection, distribution, or administration of the Lifeline \nAssistance Program provided for by the Commission \nunder regulations set forth in section 69.117 of title 47, \nCode of Federal Regulations, and other related sections \nof such title.\u201d).  Those regulations made the National \nExchange Carrier Association (\u201cNECA\u201d) responsible \nfor calculating the Lifeline Assistance charges levied  \non local exchange carriers.  See 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 69.117  \n(10-1-95 ed.).  And they gave local exchange carriers a \nsmall role in determining the size of Lifeline Assistance \ncharges because carriers could obtain subsidies for their \nself-reported costs incurred in waiving one kind of reg-\nulatory fee.  See id. \u00a7 69.104(\u200aj) (10-1-95 ed.). \n\n61a \n \nBut the fact that \u00a7 254 incorporated certain pre-1996 \nLifeline Assistance program regulations does not sug-\ngest Congress authorized FCC\u2019s abdication of responsi-\nbility for the USF Tax to private entities.  That is for \nthree reasons. \nFirst, NECA\u2019s role under 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 69.117 in 1995 \nwas not remotely analogous to USAC\u2019s current role of \nadministering the entire USF.  Section 69.117 charged \nNECA only with two simple, ministerial tasks:  (1) Cal-\nculating Lifeline Assistance charges by \u201cdividing the \nsum of one-twelfth of the projected annual Lifeline As-\nsistance revenue requirement and one-twelfth of the \nprojected annual revenue requirement calculated by all \ntelephone companies pursuant to \u00a7 69.104(l) by the num-\nber of common lines presubscribed to interexchange \ncarriers.  . . .  \u201d  Id. \u00a7 69.117(b) (10-1-95 ed.).  And \n(2) \u201cbill[ing] and collect[ing] the charge, and disburs-\n[ing] associated revenue.\u201d  Ibid.  USAC\u2019s role as USF \nadministrator, by contrast, involves far more than min-\nisterial tasks.  See supra, Part III.C.1.c. \nSecond, the carriers\u2019 role under 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 69.117 \n(and associated regulations) in 1995 was not analogous \nto their role in 2023.  Before the 1996 Act, FCC regu-\nlations authorized certain carriers to bill the Lifeline \nProgram for costs associated with waiving certain mi-\nnor, regulatorily imposed end user common line charges \nfor certain means-tested subscribers pursuant to a  \ncarrier-developed plan certified by FCC. \n \nId.  \n\u00a7 69.104(\u200aj) (10-1-95 ed.).  But carriers could waive end \nuser charges only if they reduced their own service rate \ncharges by an equivalent amount.  Ibid.  That is noth-\ning like the modern universal service regime, which al-\nlows a greatly expanded class of carriers to bill USF for \n\n62a \n \na broad range of subsidized services provided at no cost \nto themselves. \nThird, even if the role NECA and telecommunica-\ntions carriers played in administering Lifeline Assis-\ntance charges before \u00a7 254 was analogous to the role \nthey play in administering the modern Lifeline Pro-\ngram, there is no evidence Congress contemplated pri-\nvate entities would play the same role in administering \nthe three other major universal service programs FCC \nhas established pursuant to its \u00a7 254 authority.  That \nCongress provided a narrow role for certain private en-\ntities in administering a small government program sub-\nsidizing one kind of telecommunications service says \nnothing about whether Congress authorized a broadly \nexpanded class of private entities to play a central role \nin administering a nine-billion-dollar welfare fund offer-\ning subsidies for technologies no one could have imag-\nined when \u00a7 254 was enacted.  If anything, the text of  \n\u00a7 254 suggests Congress actually meant to preclude pri-\nvate entities from administering USF programs other \nthan Lifeline.  That is because NECA did administer \nthe pre-1996 USF.  See 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 69.116 (10-1-95 ed.).  \nBut NECA\u2019s USF responsibilities were distinct from its \nLifeline Assistance responsibilities; the former were \nspelled out in \u00a7 69.116, and the latter in \u00a7 69.117.  Con-\ngress referenced \u00a7 69.117 in \u00a7 254, but it conspicuously \ndid not reference \u00a7 69.116.  Congress\u2019s explicit recog-\nnition of one relatively minor aspect of private compa-\nnies\u2019 participation in the pre-1996 Lifeline Assistance \nregime thus evinces that Congress knew how to empower \nprivate companies and chose not to empower them to ad-\nminister other aspects of the USF. \n\n63a \n \nSo if Congress authorized FCC to delegate sweeping \nuniversal service responsibilities to private entities, it \ndid not say so very clearly.  Indeed, it speaks volumes \nthat the only plausible statutory justification for FCC\u2019s \nsubdelegation\u2014\u00a7 254(\u200aj)\u2014is so ambiguous that FCC, \nwhich should be more familiar with \u00a7 254 than anyone, \ndid not even think to point to it as justification for its \nreliance on private companies to set the USF Tax. \n* * * \nFCC subdelegated the power to determine the uni-\nversal service contribution amount to USAC, who fur-\nther subdelegated it to private, for- profit telecommuni-\ncations carriers.  That subdelegation was not author-\nized.  See supra, Part III.C.2.c.  And the tasks FCC \nsubdelegated are not ministerial.  See supra, Part \nIII.C.1.b-c.  So even if Article I, \u00a7 1 does not categori-\ncally forbid USAC and private telecommunications car-\nriers from exercising the kind of power FCC has vested \nin them, it may forbid them from doing so absent ex-\npress congressional authorization.21 \n \n21 Petitioners certainly could have framed their private nondele-\ngation challenge in statutory terms.  See Consumers\u2019 Rsch, 88 F.4th \nat 933 (Newsom, J., concurring) (\u201c[I]t may be that USAC is oper-\nating in contravention of the governing statute, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254, \nwhich conspicuously never even mentions USAC, let alone author-\nizes its involvement in the universal-service program.\u201d  (emphasis \nin original)).  But assuming private entities are permitted to ex-\nercise government power at all, the decision to delegate govern-\nment power to a private entity is itself a legislative one.  And since \nagencies may not wield legislative power, we are persuaded FCC\u2019s \nunauthorized decision to delegate government power to a private \nactor likely violates not only \u00a7 254 but also Article I, \u00a7 1 of the Con-\nstitution.  But see id. at 933 n.5 (Newsom, J., concurring) (ex-\n \n\n64a \n \nD. \nWe are highly skeptical that the contribution factor \nbefore us comports with the bar on congressional dele-\ngations of legislative power.  And we are similarly \nskeptical that it comports with the general rule that pri-\nvate entities may not wield governmental power, espe-\ncially not without express and unambiguous congres-\nsional authorization.  But we need not resolve either \nquestion in this case.  That is because the combination \nof Congress\u2019s sweeping delegation to FCC and FCC\u2019s \nunauthorized subdelegation to USAC violates the Leg-\nislative Vesting Clause in Article I, \u00a7 1. \nWe (1) explain the Supreme Court\u2019s cases instructing \nthat separation-of-powers jurisprudence is done holisti-\ncally, with an eye to constitutional history and structure, \nnot by dissecting government programs into their com-\nponent parts.  Then we (2) explain why an agency ac-\ntion involving a broad congressional delegation and an \nunauthorized agency subdelegation to private entities \nviolates the Constitution even if neither of those fea-\ntures does so independently. \n1. \nThe Supreme Court has instructed us to review  \nseparation-of-powers challenges holistically.  And it \nhas held that two or more things that are not inde-\npendently unconstitutional can combine to violate the \nConstitution\u2019s separation of powers. \n \npressing skepticism that the lack of statutory authorization for a \ndelegation to a private entity \u201chas any real bearing on the consti-\ntutional [private nondelegation] question\u201d (emphasis in original)). \n\n65a \n \nTake for example Seila Law, 591 U.S. 197.  The \nquestion presented in that case was whether a for-cause \nremoval restriction unconstitutionally infringed the \nPresident\u2019s power to remove the Director of the Con-\nsumer Financial Protection Bureau.  See id. at 204.  \nTwo lines of precedent seemed to converge to suggest \nthe removal restriction at issue posed no constitutional \nproblem.  First, Humphrey\u2019s Executor v. United States, \n295 U.S. 602 (1935), established that Congress may con-\nstitutionally grant for-cause removal protections to a \ngroup of agency directors that wield executive power.  \nSee also Seila L., 591 U.S. at 216 n.2 (noting that FTC \nhas always exercised executive power).  Second, Mor-\nrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654 (1988), established that Con-\ngress may constitutionally give for-cause removal pro-\ntection to a single official vested with executive author-\nity.  See also Seila L., 591 U.S. at 217 (noting that the \nindependent counsel wielded executive power).  The \nCourt of Appeals accordingly reasoned that Humph-\nrey\u2019s Executor and Morrison controlled and that the \nstatutory provision limiting the President\u2019s power to re-\nmove the CFPB director was constitutional.  CFPB v. \nSeila L. LLC, 923 F.3d 680, 684 (9th Cir. 2019). \nThe Supreme Court reversed.  It granted that some \nfor-cause removal restrictions are not problematic.  \nSee Seila L., 591 U.S. at 215.  And it granted that for-\ncause removal restrictions applied to single-member di-\nrectorships are sometimes constitutionally permissible.  \nSee id. at 217.  But it held the combination of (1) for-\ncause removal, (2) a one-member CFPB Director, and \n(3) the capacious powers of the CFPB created a consti-\ntutional problem.  Id. at 224-25; see also id. at 258 \n(Thomas, J., concurring in part) (\u201cThe constitutional vi-\nolation results from, at a minimum, the combination of \n\n66a \n \nthe removal provision and the provision allowing the \nCFPB to seek enforcement of a civil investigative de-\nmand.\u201d  (emphasis added) (citations omitted)).  In other \nwords, three features of the CFPB\u2014each independently \nconstitutional\u2014combined to create a \u201cnew situation\u201d \nthat could not be decided by reference to precedents \nthat concerned only one aspect of the problem.  Id. at \n220 (citation omitted). \nThe same kind of reasoning guided the Court in Free \nEnterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Over-\nsight Board, 561 U.S. 477 (2010).  In that case, the \nquestion presented was whether \u201cthe President [may \nbe] restricted in his ability to remove a principal officer, \nwho is in turn restricted in his ability to remove an infe-\nrior officer, even though that inferior officer determines \nthe policy and enforces the laws of the United States[.]\u201d  \nId. at 483-84.  The Court noted its previous holding \nthat Congress may provide for restrictions on the Pres-\nident\u2019s ability to remove the directors of independent \nagencies like SEC.  See id. at 483; see also Humphrey\u2019s \nExecutor, 295 U.S. 602.  It also noted its previous hold-\ning that Congress may provide for restrictions on the \npower of principal executive officers to remove their \nown inferiors.  See ibid.; see also United States v. Per-\nkins, 116 U.S. 483 (1886).  But the Court held that the \ncombination of two separate layers of removal protec-\ntions created \u201ca new situation not yet encountered by \nthe Court.\u201d  Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 483.  And \nthat combination, the Court held, violated the Constitu-\ntion.  Id. at 484. \nSeila Law and Free Enterprise Fund thus evince a \ngeneral principle that, with respect to the separation of \npowers at least, two constitutional parts do not neces-\n\n67a \n \nsarily add up to a constitutional whole.  Cf. Aristotle, \nMetaphysics, in 1 WORKS OF ARISTOTLE 569 (Mortimer \nJ. Adler ed., W. D. Ross trans., 1990) (observing \u201cthe \nwhole is\u201d often \u201csomething besides the parts\u201d).  Ra-\nther, reviewing courts must consider a government pro-\ngram holistically, with an eye toward its compatibility \nwith our constitutional history and structure.  See \nSeila L., 591 U.S. at 222. \n2. \nHere, history and structure both point in the same \ndirection:  the universal service contribution mecha-\nnism is unconstitutional. \na. \n\u201cPerhaps the most telling indication of a severe con-\nstitutional problem\u201d with the structure of a government \nprogram \u201cis a lack of historical precedent to support it.\u201d  \nId. at 220 (quotation omitted) (quoting Free Enter. \nFund, 561 U.S. at 505).  And USF\u2019s double-layered del-\negation is unprecedented. \nFirst, there is no record of any government program \nlike USF in all the U.S. Reports.  The only case that \neven remotely resembles USF\u2019s combination of a broad \ncongressional delegation with significant industry in-\nvolvement is Sunshine Anthracite, 310 U.S. 381.  See \nsupra, Part III.C.1.a. \nWhile Sunshine Anthracite is the closest analogue, it \nis not really that close. Unlike USAC and private tele-\ncommunications carriers, which de facto decide the USF \ncontribution amount, the code authorities under the Bi-\ntuminous Coal Act of 1937 only had the power to recom-\nmend minimum coal prices.  See 310 U.S. at 399 (\u201c[The \nCoal Commission], not the code authorities, determines \n\n68a \n \nthe prices.\u201d).  And the only recommendations the code \nauthorities could make were cabined by a clear rule:  \nCongress provided that minimum coal prices were to be \nfixed at a level which \u201creflect[ed] as nearly as possible \nthe relative market values at points of delivery taking \ninto account specifically enumerated factors,\u201d id. at 397 \n\u2014namely labor, supplies, power, taxes, insurance, work-\nmen\u2019s compensation, royalties, depreciation and deple-\ntion and all other direct expenses of production, coal op-\nerators\u2019 association dues, district board assessments for \nBoard operating expenses only levied under the code, \nand reasonable costs of selling and the cost of admin-\nistration.  See The Bituminous Coal Act of 1937, 50 \nStat. at 78.  Those enumerated factors, \u201cconsistently \nwith the process of coordination, yield a return to each \narea approximating its weighted average cost per ton.\u201d  \nSunshine Anthracite, 310 U.S. at 397.22 \nThat case is nothing like ours.  To make Sunshine \nAnthracite apposite, the Coal Commission\u2019s discretion \nto set minimum prices would have had to have been un-\nfettered (it was not); the Coal Commission\u2019s passive ac-\nquiescence would have had to make the code authorities\u2019 \nprice recommendations legally binding (it did not); and \nthere would have to have been evidence that the Coal \nCommission always agreed with the code authorities\u2019 \nprice recommendations (there was not). \nSecond, FCC has not pointed to any historical ana-\nlogue outside the U.S. Reports.  That is hardly surpris-\ning.  USF combines a sweeping delegation of the tax-\ning power, see supra, Part III.B, with a subdelegation of \n \n22 The statute also authorized the Commission to fix maximum \ncoal prices under certain circumstances, but the code authorities \nhad no role in formulating those maximums.  See ibid. \n\n69a \n \nthat power to private entities with a personal financial \ninterest in the size of the tax, see supra, Part III.C.  It \nis difficult to imagine early Congresses would have au-\nthorized a similarly dual-layered delegation of the tax-\ning power. \nTrue, Congress has always relied on the executive to \nexecute tax laws.  For example, in 1798 Congress \nvested tax assessors with authority to value real estate \nfor the purpose of administering a nationwide direct tax.  \nSee Act of July 14, 1798, ch. 75, 1 Stat. 597 (1798); see \nalso Nicholas R. Parrillo, A Critical Assessment of the \nOriginalist Case Against Administrative Regulatory \nPower: New Evidence from the Federal Tax on Private \nReal Estate in the 1790s, 130 YALE L.J. 1288 (2021).  \nBut the 1798 direct tax is no precedent for the USF Tax \nbecause the 1798 direct tax is nothing like the USF Tax.  \nThat is for three reasons. \nFirst, the 1798 Congress itself decided the amount of \nrevenue the Government would levy from American cit-\nizens.  See Parrillo, New Evidence, supra, at 1303 (\u201cCon-\ngress decided to raise $2 million nationwide and, per the \nConstitution\u2019s requirement for direct taxes, apportioned \nthat sum among the states according to each state\u2019s free \npopulation plus three-fifths of its slave population.\u201d).  \nIn contrast, Congress through \u00a7 254 delegated to FCC \nthe power to decide how much revenue the Government \nwill raise via USF taxes.  And FCC\u2019s revenue-raising \ndiscretion is limited only by the most amorphous of \nstandards.  See supra, Part III.B.2.  So while the 1798 \nExecutive Branch only had authority to raise $2 million, \nthe present-day FCC can levy taxes practically ad in-\nfinitum based on little more than its own conception of \n\n70a \n \nthe public interest.  See ibid.  It thus strains credulity to \nanalogize the 1798 direct tax to the USF Tax. \nSecond (and relatedly), unlike the Congress that en-\nacted \u00a7 254, the 1798 Congress made all the relevant tax \npolicy decisions.  It decided to raise $2 million, it de-\ncided to levy the $2 million through direct taxes on prop-\nerty (mostly real estate), and it decided how the tax bur-\nden would be allocated:  mainly in proportion to the \nvalue of citizens\u2019 property in money.  Parrillo, New Ev-\nidence, supra, at 1303; see supra, Part III.B.2 (explain-\ning the policy decisions \u00a7 254 leaves for FCC).  That \nmakes sense because tax decisions\u2014including decisions \nabout rates\u2014traditionally implicated the legislative power \nand so could not be made by officials in the executive \nbranch.  See PHILLIP HAMBURGER, IS ADMINISTRA-\nTIVE LAW UNLAWFUL 57-64 (2014). \nObviously a direct tax on land could not be adminis-\ntered without a fair accounting of the value of citizens\u2019 \nproperty, so Congress provided for assessors and gave \nthem authority to assess the value of citizens\u2019 property. \nCongress did not provide detailed instructions about \nhow assessors were to go about their business, but that \nis of no significance.  At common law, \u201c[d]etermina-\ntions of facts, including assessments, were understood  \n. . .  to be judicial in nature, not legislative.  Although \nnot actually exercises of judicial power, they were ex-\npected to mimic judicial decisions at least in being exer-\ncises of judgment\u201d as opposed to legislative will.  Ham-\nburger, Nondelegation Blues, supra, at 1211 (emphasis \nadded).  In other words, the making of assessments \nhas never involved legislative power because it has al-\nways been assumed that assessors must accurately \n\n71a \n \ncharacterize the facts on the ground and fairly apply the \nlaw to the facts. \nFor example, in 1598 the English Court of Common \nPleas heard a case concerning the power of the sewers \ncommissioners, who were tasked with repairing \nriverbanks and assessing the costs to nearby landown-\ners.  See Rooke\u2019s Case, 77 Eng. Rep. 209 (C.P. 1598) \n(Coke, J.).  The commissioners repaired a riverbank \nand then assessed the entire cost to one nearby land-\nowner.  The landowner sued, and Lord Coke held the \ncommissioners acted unlawfully because they were sup-\nposed to assess repair costs to \u201call who had land in dan-\nger.\u201d  Id. at 210.  Coke explained that while \u201c[t]he \nwords of the commission [gave] authority to the commis-\nsioners to do according to their discretions,\u201d the com-\nmissioners could \u201cnot [act] according to their wills and \nprivate affections\u201d but rather were \u201climited and bound \nwith the rule of reason and law.\u201d  Id. at 210.  Thus, the \ndiscretion possessed by the commissioners was merely \nthe discretion \u201cto discern between falsity and truth.\u201d  \nIbid.  In other words, the commissioners had the \npower to determine whose land was truly endangered by \ndamaged riverbanks, but they could not use that discre-\ntion to make policy judgments about which landowners \nshould bear the cost of repairing those banks.  See \nHAMBURGER, IS ADMINISTRATIVE LAW UNLAWFUL,  \nsupra, at 97-100 (describing the nature of assessments \nat common law). \nLike the common law assessors, the tax assessors at \nthe founding had discretion merely \u201cto discern between \nfalsity and truth\u201d in property values.  Rooke\u2019s Case, 77 \nEng. Rep. at 210.  Federal officials assumed all prop-\nerty had a \u201ccorrect valuation.\u201d  Parrillo, New Evi-\n\n72a \n \ndence, supra, at 1366 (quoting OLIVER WOLCOTT, JR., \nDIRECT TAXES 441 (1796)).  The task of officials exe-\ncuting the direct tax was merely to make the factual de-\nterminations necessary to unearth that correct valua-\ntion.  Congress told the assessors to do this \u201cjust[ly] \nand equitab[ly]\u201d\u2014\u201ca familiar measure of the conduct of \ngovernment officials making judicial or judicial-like de-\nterminations, including assessments.\u201d  Hamburger, \nNondelegation Blues, supra, at 1212.  The assessors \naccordingly had no power to make tax policy, at least not \nlegitimately.  And the kinds of factual findings Con-\ngress charged the assessors with making have never \nbeen thought to involve legislative power.  See, e.g., \nPanama Refin., 293 U.S. at 426 (\u201c[A]uthorizations given \nby Congress to selected instrumentalities for the pur-\npose of ascertaining the existence of facts to which leg-\nislation is directed have constantly been sustained.\u201d). \nIt is possible that assessors sometimes mischaracter-\nized the value of property so as to shift the tax burden \nfrom one group of citizens to another.  See Hamburger, \nNondelegation Blues, supra, at 1212 (noting \u201cassess-\nments and other determinations of fact have often been \nmisused to exercise a disguised legislative power\u201d).  If \nthat is right, some assessors may have exercised will ra-\nther than judgment and so acted in a legislative rather \nthan an executive capacity.  But in doing so, the asses-\nsors abused the power the 1798 Congress gave them, \nand abuses of a power do not change the nature of the \npower itself.  For example, it is commonly said that the \nSupreme Court in Lochner abused the judicial power.  \nSee, e.g., Kermit Roosevelt III, What if Slaughter-\nHouse had been Decided Differently?, 45 IND. L. REV. \n61, 84 (2011) (noting in Lochner the court committed \n\u201cthe sin  . . .  of substituting judicial for legislative \n\n73a \n \npolicymaking\u201d).  But no one contends that in light of \nLochner\u2019s abuses the Court in fact exercises legislative \npower when it rules in constitutional cases.  So too with \nthe assessors. \nThus, we can find no historical precedent for broad \ndelegations of Congress\u2019s power to tax.  But even if \nthere were\u2014even if the 1798 direct tax suggests Con-\ngress may delegate the Taxing Power to the Executive \nBranch\u2014there is still no historical precedent for the \nUSF Tax.  That is because it is utterly inconceivable \nthat the first Treasury, upon receiving from Congress \nbroad powers to levy taxes on American citizens, would \nhave abdicated responsibility for determining tax rates \nto privately employed bounty hunters who had a per-\nsonal financial interest in the amount of tax revenue col-\nlected.  And that is exactly what FCC has done here. \nSee supra, Part III.C. \nAccordingly, USF\u2019s double-layered delegation \u201cis an \ninnovation with no foothold in history or tradition.\u201d  \nSeila L., 591 U.S. at 222. \nb. \nIn addition to being a historical anomaly, USF\u2019s  \ndouble-layered delegation \u201cis incompatible with our con-\nstitutional structure.\u201d  Ibid. \nBoth the public and the private nondelegation doc-\ntrines exist to ensure that Congress exercises its legis-\nlative powers\u2014the greatest of the powers vested by the \nConstitution in the federal government\u2014\u201cin a way that \ncomports with the People\u2019s will.\u201d23  Jarkesy, 34 F.4th at \n \n23 The private nondelegation doctrine also likely applies to dele-\ngations of the executive power to private entities, see Amtrak II, \n \n\n74a \n \n459; see THE FEDERALIST NO. 51 (J. Madison) (\u201cA de-\npendence on the people is, no doubt, the primary control \non the government[.]\u201d).  As we previously noted: \nEvery member of Congress is accountable to his or \nher constituents through regular popular elections. \nAnd a duly elected Congress may exercise the legis-\nlative power only through the assent of two sepa-\nrately constituted chambers (bicameralism) and the \napproval of the President (presentment).  This pro-\ncess, cumbersome though it may often seem to eager \nonlookers, ensures that the People can be heard and \nthat their representatives have deliberated before \nthe strong hand of the federal government raises to \nchange the rights and responsibilities attendant to \nour public life. \nJarkesy, 34 F.4th at 459-60 (citations and footnote omit-\nted).  \u201cBut that accountability evaporates if a person or \nentity other than Congress,\u201d whether public or private, \n\u201cexercises legislative power.\u201d  Id. at 460 (citation omit-\nted). \nBroad congressional delegations to the executive un-\ndermine democratic accountability for at least three rea-\n \n575 U.S. at 62 (Alito, J., concurring) (\u201c[I]t raises \u2018difficult and fun-\ndamental questions\u2019 about the \u2018delegation of Executive power\u2019 when \nCongress authorizes citizen suits.\u201d) (quoting Friends of the Earth, \nInc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, \n197 (2000) (Kennedy, J., concurring), but petitioners did not raise \nan Article II challenge.  If they had, we might also conclude that \nFCC has unconstitutionally delegated the executive power to pri-\nvate entities.  See Consumers\u2019 Rsch, 88 F.4th at 934 (Newsom, J., \nconcurring) (\u201c[I]t seems obvious to me that in collecting de facto \ntaxes and distributing benefits USAC is exercising \u2018executive\u2019 \npower.\u201d). \n\n75a \n \nsons.  First, they allow Congress to circumvent the \n\u201cmany accountability checkpoints\u201d inherent in the Con-\nstitutional lawmaking process.  Amtrak II, 575 U.S. at \n61 (Alito, J., concurring).  Second, they obscure lines of \naccountability the Framers intended to be clear.  See \nGundy, 588 U.S. at 155 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting) (\u201c[B]y \ndirecting that legislating be done only by elected repre-\nsentatives in a public process, the Constitution sought \nto ensure that the lines of accountability would be clear:  \nThe sovereign people would know, without ambiguity, \nwhom to hold accountable for the laws they would have \nto follow.\u201d); id. at 156 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting) (\u201cLegis-\nlators might seek to take credit for addressing a press-\ning social problem by sending it to the executive for res-\nolution, while at the same time blaming the executive for \nthe problems that attend whatever measures he chooses \nto pursue.  In turn, the executive might point to Con-\ngress as the source of the problem.  These opportuni-\nties for finger-pointing might prove temptingly advan-\ntageous for the politicians involved, but they would also \nthreaten to disguise responsibility for the decisions.\u201d  \n(citations and quotation omitted)).  And third, they \nrender the promise of recourse to the judiciary illusory \nbecause they give reviewing courts no standard against \nwhich to measure the compatibility of executive action \nwith the prescriptions of the people\u2019s elected represent-\natives.  See id. at 167-68 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting) (not-\ning the similarity of the questions raised in vagueness \nchallenges and delegation challenges). \nDelegations to private entities undermine accounta-\nbility for different reasons.  Most obviously, private \nentities are \u201cneither legally nor politically accountable \nto  . . .  government officials or to the electorate.\u201d  \nLarkin, The Private Delegation Doctrine, supra, at 20; \n\n76a \n \nsee Black, 53 F.4th at 880 (\u201c[I]f people outside govern-\nment could wield the government\u2019s power[ ]then the \ngovernment\u2019s promised accountability to the people \nwould be an illusion.\u201d).  Unlike officers of the United \nStates, who \u201cmust take an oath or affirmation to support \nthe Constitution,\u201d Amtrak II, 575 U.S. at 57 (Alito, J., \nconcurring) (citing U.S. CONST. art. VI, cl. 3), directors \nof private entities owe no fealty to the Constitution and \ninstead owe legal obligations to their shareholders.  \nSee 2 BUS. & COM. LITIG. FED. CTS. \u00a7 13:77 (5th ed.) \n(\u201cUnder Delaware law, directors, officers, and control-\nling shareholders owe a duty of loyalty to the company \nand to its shareholders or owners.\u201d).  Moreover, \u201cpass-\ning off a Government operation as an independent pri-\nvate concern\u201d allows \u201cGovernment officials [to] wield \npower without owning up to the consequences\u201d because \nthe people might not associate bad results with the Gov-\nernment at all.  Amtrak II, 575 U.S. at 57 (Alito, J., \nconcurring). \nUSF combines these features, meaning accountabil-\nity is undermined twice over.  First, the public cannot \ntell whether it is being taxed by the FCC or USAC.  \nSee Universal Service, UNIVERSAL SERV. ADMIN. CO., \nsupra (\u201cUsing information from universal service pro-\ngram participants, USAC estimates how much money \nwill be needed each quarter to provide universal service \nsupport.\u201d  (emphasis added)).  And if some sleuthing \nmember of the public suspected the federal government \nwas behind the mysterious USF charge on his phone \nbill, how could he determine which governmental official \nto blame?  Not only could Congress and FCC point fin-\ngers at each other, see Gundy, 588 U.S. at 156 (Gorsuch, \nJ., dissenting), but both could offload responsibility onto \nthe private entities (USAC and its private, for-profit, \n\n77a \n \nconstituents) to which FCC delegated the USF Tax \nwithout congressional authorization.  See Free Enter. \nFund, 561 U.S. at 497-98 (\u201cThe diffusion of power car-\nries with it a diffusion of accountability  . . .  Without \na clear and effective chain of command, the public can-\nnot determine on whom the blame or the punishment of \na pernicious measure, or series of pernicious measures \nought really to fall.\u201d  (citation omitted)).  And even as \ngovernment officials are immunized from public over-\nsight by this \u201cMatryoshka doll\u201d of delegations and sub-\ndelegations, id. at 497, important governmental respon-\nsibilities are carried out by private entities with a legal \nobligation not to serve the public but rather to reap prof-\nits from it.  And last but not least, reviewing courts are \nhandicapped from redressing the injuries of aggrieved \ncitizens by the complete absence of a judicially workable \nstandard in 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254. \nThus, just as the added layer of tenure protection at \nissue in Free Enterprise Fund \u201cma[de] a difference\u201d to \nthe President\u2019s ability control the executive branch, id. \nat 495, so too do the myriad obfuscations of the USF Tax \nmake a difference to the Legislative Vesting Clause.  \nAccordingly, we hold that the universal service contri-\nbution mechanism\u2019s double-layered delegation \u201cis in-\ncompatible with our constitutional structure.\u201d  Seila \nL., 591 U.S. at 222. \nIV. \nFinally, a brief word about the dissenting opinions. \nThe principal dissent spills much ink on the distinction \nbetween fees and taxes only to conclude the distinction \ndoes not matter because all \u201crevenue-raising delega-\ntion[s]\u201d are the same.  Post, at 96 (Stewart, J., dissent-\ning).  And how does the Constitution permit double in-\n\n78a \n \nsulation of a revenue-raising delegation like the USF? \nThe principal dissent does not say. \nThe second dissenting opinion calls the majority \nopinion \nan \n\u201cunannounced\u201d \nand \n\u201cunprecedented\u201d \n\u201csleight of hand.\u201d  Post, at 98, 105 (Higginson, J., dis-\nsenting).  Worse, it is a usurpation that leaves \u201cthe po-\nlitical branches powerless to govern.\u201d  Post, at 101, \n105.  With deepest respect for our esteemed colleagues \nwho see this case differently, the dissenting opinion\u2019s le-\ngal authorities do not support its conclusions. \nFor example, it repeatedly accuses us of contraven-\ning Supreme Court precedent.  Post, at 98, 99, 100, 101, \n103, 105 (Higginson, J., dissenting).  But which prece-\ndent, precisely, are we flouting?  The dissenting opin-\nion does not say.  The closest it comes is to contend that \nthe Supreme Court has considered cases involving both \na \u201cdelegation of legislative power and a[ ] delegation of \ngovernment power to a private entity, yet the Court has \nnever instructed  . . .  that a different standard ap-\nplies.\u201d  Id. at 98-99 (Higginson, J., dissenting).  But in \nwhich case did the Supreme Court consider a double del-\negation problem like the one presented here?  The \nstatutory provision at issue in Carter Coal did not fea-\nture a combined public/private delegation; it delegated \npower directly to private enterprise.  See 298 U.S. at \n283-84.  And the Court found that violated the Consti-\ntution.  Id. at 311.  Having found that statute uncon-\nstitutional, it would have been quite peculiar for the \nCourt to proceed to render an advisory opinion on \nwhether a nonexistent double delegation would also vio-\nlate the Constitution. \nMeanwhile, in Currin and Sunshine Anthracite, the \nCourt found the Government had not delegated any leg-\n\n79a \n \nislative power to any private entity.  See Currin, 306 \nU.S. at 15 (\u201cSo far as growers of tobacco are concerned, \nthe required referendum does not involve any delega-\ntion of legislative authority.\u201d); Sunshine Anthracite, 310 \nU.S. at 399 (\u201cSince law-making is not entrusted to the \nindustry, this statutory scheme is unquestionably valid.\u201d).  \nThere cannot be a combined public/private delegation \nwithout a private delegation.  We obviously agree with \nour esteemed colleagues in dissent that Supreme Court \nprecedent binds us and binds us absolutely.  But we do \nnot understand how the dissenting opinions can say this \ncase is controlled by Supreme Court precedent without \ndisputing that the double delegation at issue here is un-\nprecedented. \nThe second dissenting opinion also contends we have \nmischaracterized the Supreme Court\u2019s separation-of-\npowers precedents.  On its telling, Seila Law does not \nevince a general principle that two constitutional parts \ncan converge to create an unconstitutional whole.  Ra-\nther, it says the Seila Law Court simply declined to rec-\nognize an exception to the President\u2019s removal power \nfor single principal officers who wield significant execu-\ntive authority.  Post, at 100 (Higginson, J., dissenting).  \nEven if that were right, it would not explain Free Enter-\nprise Fund.  In that case the Court unquestionably \nheld that two independently constitutional removal  \nrestrictions\u2014one that fit squarely within the Humph-\nrey\u2019s Executor exception, and one that fit squarely \nwithin the Morrison exception\u2014combined to create a \nconstitutional violation.  The dissenting opinion offers \nno explanation for that holding. \nFinally, the second dissenting opinion contends our \ndecision leaves the political branches \u201cpowerless to gov-\n\n80a \n \nern.\u201d  Post, at 105 (Higginson, J., dissenting).  That is \nquite an assertion, but with greatest respect, it is un-\ntrue.  Today\u2019s decision applies to a narrow question, \nimplicating just one federal program that is doubly in-\nsulated from political accountability.  The parties be-\nfore us have not pointed to other federal programs that \nhave the same or similar constitutional defects.  And as \nto the USF particularly, Congress could obviate the con-\nstitutional problem by simply ratifying USAC\u2019s deci-\nsions about how much American citizens should contrib-\nute to the goal of universal service.  Cf. Saikrishna \nBangalore Prakash, The Sky Will Not Fall:  Managing \nthe Transition to a Revitalized Nondelegation Doc-\ntrine, in THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE BEFORE THE SU-\nPREME COURT, supra, at 290 (\u201cLegislative ratification of \nagency law would wholly preclude a nondelegation chal-\nlenge[.]\u201d). \nThe second dissenting opinion contends otherwise \nbecause, in its view, the Federal Government will grind \nto a halt if Congress, or even FCC, were required to do \nmore than wield a Russian veto over the USF tax.  As \nevidence, it points to private contractors who perform \nministerial functions on behalf of the Centers for Medi-\ncare and Medicaid Services.  Post, at 103 (Higginson, \nJ., dissenting).  But if anything, Medicare and Medi-\ncaid prove the opposite.  Congress\u2014not a federal \nagency, and certainly not executives of private compa-\nnies\u2014decides how much Americans should be taxed to \nfund federal healthcare programs.  See, e.g., Louise \nSheiner, Lorae Stojanovic, & David Wessel, How does \nMedicare work?  And how is it financed?, BROOKINGS \n(Mar. 20, 2024), https://perma.cc/D7LN-DHYW (ex-\nplaining the Government\u2019s contributions to Medicare \ncome from a combination of general revenues and pay-\n\n81a \n \nroll taxes); 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101 (setting the Medicare pay-\nroll tax rate).  The unconstitutionality of the USF says \nnothing about other tax programs, like Medicare and \nMedicaid, that Congress administers. \n* * * \nAmerican telecommunications consumers are subject \nto a multi-billion-dollar tax nobody voted for.  The size \nof that tax is de facto determined by a trade group \nstaffed by industry insiders with no semblance of ac-\ncountability to the public.  And the trade group in turn \nrelies on projections made by its private, for-profit con-\nstituent companies, all of which stand to profit from \nevery single tax increase.  This combination of delega-\ntions, subdelegations, and obfuscations of the USF Tax \nmechanism offends Article I, \u00a7 1 of the Constitution. \nFor the foregoing reasons, we hold unconstitutional \nthe Q1 2022 USF Tax.  Accordingly, we GRANT the \npetition and REMAND to FCC for further proceedings. \n\n82a \n \nJENNIFER WALKER ELROD, Circuit Judge, joined by \nHO and ENGELHARDT, Circuit Judges, concurring: \nI concur in the majority opinion in full.  The major-\nity correctly and thoroughly identifies the concerns that \nmake this double delegation unconstitutional.  I write \nseparately to say that I would go one step further and \naddress the lawfulness of each individual delegation.  \nFor the reasons explained in the majority\u2019s thorough \nopinion, Congress\u2019s delegation of legislative power to \nthe FCC and the FCC\u2019s delegation of the taxing power \nto a private entity each individually contravene the sep-\naration of powers principle that undergirds our Consti-\ntutional Republic. \nAs James Madison put it, \u201c[t]he accumulation of all \npowers legislative, executive, and judiciary in the same \nhands,  . . .  may justly be pronounced the very defi-\nnition of tyranny.\u201d  Dep\u2019t of Transp. v. Ass\u2019n of Am. R.R., \n575 U.S. 43, 74 (2015) (Thomas, J., concurring) (quoting \nThe Federalist No. 47, p. 301 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961)); see \nalso Baron de Montesquieu, The Spirit of the Laws, bk. \nXI, ch. VI (1748) (\u201cWhen the legislative and executive \npowers are united in the same person, or in the same \nbody of magistrates, there can be no liberty; . . . .\u201d). \nTo ensure that the legislative power remains sepa-\nrate from the executive power, the Constitution \u201cpro-\nvides strict rules to ensure that Congress exercises the \nlegislative power in a way that comports with the Peo-\nple\u2019s will.\u201d  Jarkesy v. Sec. and Exch. Comm\u2019n, 34 \nF.4th 446, 459 (5th Cir. 2022) aff\u200a\u2019d, No. 22-859, 2024 WL \n3187811 (U.S. June 27, 2024).  Each member of Con-\ngress is accountable to his or her constituents through \nregular popular elections.  U.S. Const. art I, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3; id. \namend. XVII, cl. 1.  And Congress may exercise legis-\n\n83a \n \nlative power (including the power to tax) only by going \nthrough the arduous process of bicameralism and pre-\nsentment.  U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 7.  This \u201censures that \nthe People can be heard and that their representatives \nhave deliberated before the strong hand of the federal \ngovernment raises to change the rights and responsibil-\nities attendant to our public life.\u201d  Jarkesy, 34 F.4th at \n459-60.  Each of the delegations here, viewed inde-\npendently, violates this principle. \nJustifying the Congressional delegation on the \ngrounds that Congress has enlisted the \u201cexpertise\u201d of \nthe FCC in the undefined area of Universal Service \nrings hollow given that the FCC relies on the determi-\nnations of private industry leaders to determine the \nUSF tax. \nThe second dissent states that the federal govern-\nment is rendered \u201cpowerless to govern\u201d by the major-\nity\u2019s holding.  Post, at 101 (Higginson, J., dissenting).  \nThat is a non sequitur.  Congress can always act by \npassing duly enacted legislation through bicameralism \nand presentment.  The assertion that delegations of \nlegislative power are necessary for effective and effi-\ncient governance in the modern world does not author-\nize Congress to violate Article I, Section I\u2019s vesting \nclause.  Congress\u2019s inability to implement and oversee \nthe program itself might even suggest that the program \nshould not exist.  Regardless, Congress must imple-\nment, or at least approve, the USF tax.  That way, the \npower of the people to oversee those they have chosen \nto govern is rightfully restored.1 \n \n1  They are, after all, the ones ultimately footing the bill for Uni-\nversal Service. \n\n84a \n \nWith this in mind, I join the thorough and well-rea-\nsoned opinion of the court in full. \n\n85a \n \nJAMES C. HO, Circuit Judge, concurring: \nOur Constitution establishes three branches of gov-\nernment, not four.1  It vests \u201c[a]ll legislative Powers \nherein granted\u201d\u2014including the \u201cPower To lay and col-\nlect Taxes\u201d\u2014not in some unnamed fourth branch of gov-\nernment, but in \u201ca Congress of the United States,\u201d \nwhose members are chosen by and directly accountable \nto the people of the United States.  U.S. CONST. art. I, \n\u00a7\u00a7 1, 8.  So if we\u2019re serious about protecting our consti-\ntutional democracy, we must enforce the principle that \nall legislative powers like the power to tax are indeed \nexercised by the people we elect. \nThat\u2019s what our court does today.  We hold that the \ndelegation of Congress\u2019s taxing power, first to a federal \nagency, and then to a private entity, violates the Vesting \nClause of Article I.  I certainly concur. \nIn reaching this decision, the court distinguishes \nTexas v. Rettig, 987 F.3d 518 (5th Cir. 2021).  I would \nalso disavow Rettig altogether, for the reasons noted in \nTexas v. Rettig, 993 F.3d 408, 408 (5th Cir. 2021) (Ho, J., \ndissenting from denial of rehearing en banc). \nThe delegations of taxing authority at issue in Rettig \npresent the same challenges to our constitutional  \ndemocracy\u2014and to the founding principle of taxation \nwithout representation\u2014that are presented here.  It\u2019s \njust as true in Rettig as it is here that \u201c[t]he right to vote \n \n1  See, e.g., Ameron, Inc. v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 787 \nF.2d 875, 892 (3rd Cir. 1986) (Becker, J., concurring) (\u201cThe Consti-\ntution establishes three branches of government, not four.\u201d); Ass\u2019n \nof American Railroads v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Transp., 821 F.3d 19, 30-31 \n(D.C. Cir. 2016) (various provisions of \u201cour Constitution  . . .  \nwere designed for a government of three branches, not four\u201d). \n\n86a \n \nmeans nothing if we abandon our constitutional commit-\nments and allow the real work of lawmaking to be exer-\ncised by private interests colluding with agency bureau-\ncrats, rather than by elected officials accountable to the \nAmerican voter.\u201d  Id. at 410-11. \nAnd both in Rettig and here, the threats to democ-\nracy presented by the administrative state are not inad-\nvertent, but intentional\u2014a deliberate design to turn \nconsent of the governed into an illusion.  \u201c[T]he expan-\nsion of the electorate has been accompanied by the \ngrowth of administrative law.  . . .  [W]hether in \n1870, 1920, or 1965  . . .  each time, after representa-\ntive government became more open to the people, legis-\nlative power increasingly has been sequestered to a part \nof government that is largely closed to them.\u201d  PHILIP \nHAMBURGER, IS ADMINISTRATIVE LAW UNLAWFUL?  \n369 (2014).  \u201c[A]lthough [members of the knowledge \nclass] mostly supported expanded suffrage, they also \nsupported the removal of legislative power to adminis-\ntrative agencies staffed by persons who shared their \noutlook.\u201d  Id. at 374.  \u201cThe development of adminis-\ntrative power thus  . . .  must be recognized as  . . .  \na profoundly disturbing shift of power.  As soon as the \npeople secured the power to vote, a new class cordoned \noff for themselves a sort of legislative power that they \ncould exercise without representation.\u201d  Id.  Another \nscholar put it this way:  \u201cHowever much [administra-\ntive] agencies may emphasize their formal openness, in \npractice well-organized, directly interested parties dom-\ninate comment processes.  Normal people do not per-\nceive these proceedings as \u2018democratic.\u2019\u200a\u201d  PHILIP A. \nWALLACH, WHY CONGRESS? 231 (2023).  With Con-\ngress, \u201cthe electorate still has the chance, crude as it \nmay be, to pass judgment on the elected official and con-\n\n87a \n \nvince other members of their community of the im-\nportance of doing so. Against . . . the bureaucracy, citi-\nzens have no such recourse.\u201d Id. \nWe devote significant energy and resources to secur-\ning the right to vote for every citizen.  But that right \nmatters only if our elected officials matter.  There\u2019s no \npoint in voting if the real power rests in the hands of \nunelected bureaucrats\u2014or their private delegates.  If \nyou believe in democracy, then you should oppose an ad-\nministrative state that shields government action from \naccountability to the people.  I concur. \n\n88a \n \nCARL E. STEWART, Circuit Judge, joined by RICHMAN, \nChief Judge, and SOUTHWICK, HAYNES, GRAVES, HIG-\nGINSON, and DOUGLAS, Circuit Judges, dissenting: \nI dissent because the Universal Service Fund \n(\u201cUSF\u201d) is not unconstitutional.  Section 254 of the Tel-\necommunications Act of 1996 provides an intelligible \nprinciple and the Federal Communications Commission \n(\u201cFCC\u201d) maintains control over the Universal Service \nAdministrative Company (\u201cUSAC\u201d), the private entity \nentrusted to aid its administration of the USF.  The \nmajority\u2019s exhaustive exegesis about policy, history, and \nassorted doctrines does not eclipse the consistent hold-\ning of three sister circuits that have addressed constitu-\ntional challenges to Section 254.  All have held it con-\nstitutional under the intelligible principle test.  The \nmajority has created a split in a sweeping opinion that \n(1) crafts an amorphous new standard to analyze dele-\ngations, (2) overturns\u2014without much fanfare\u2014circuit \nprecedent holding that this program collects adminis-\ntrative fees and not taxes, (3) blurs the distinction be-\ntween taxes and fees, and (4) rejects established admin-\nistrative law principles and all evidence to the contrary \nto create a private nondelegation doctrine violation. \nI.  THE NONDELEGATION DOCTRINE \nPetitioners and the majority contend that \u00a7 254 vio-\nlates the nondelegation doctrine.  Notably, the Su-\npreme Court has denied petitions for review of the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s and the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s decisions rejecting \nthese contentions.  Consumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, No.  \n23-456, 2024 WL 2883753 (U.S. June 10, 2024) (Mem.); \nConsumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, No. 23-743, 2024 WL 2883755 \n(U.S. June 10, 2024) (Mem.).  In line with our col-\nleagues in the Sixth, Eleventh, and D.C. Circuits, I \n\n89a \n \nwould reject this challenge and hold that \u00a7 254 satisfies \nthe intelligible principle test as articulated by the Su-\npreme Court. \na.  Section 254 Sufficiently Delimits the  \nFCC\u2019s Discretion \nThe nondelegation doctrine is based on the central \nprinciple that the separation of powers underlies our \nsystem of Government.  See Mistretta v. United States, \n488 U.S. 361, 371 (1989).  Article I, Section 1 of the U.S. \nConstitution provides that \u201c[a]ll legislative Powers \nherein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the \nUnited States.\u201d  U.S. CONST., art. I, \u00a7 1.  The Court \nhas long acknowledged that Congress \u201cmay confer sub-\nstantial discretion on executive agencies to implement \nand enforce the laws\u201d where it \u201chas supplied an intelli-\ngible principle to guide the delegee\u2019s use of discretion.\u201d  \nGundy v. United States, 588 U.S. 128, 135 (2019) (plu-\nrality opinion) (emphasis added).  It has consistently \nheld that a delegation is constitutional if \u201cCongress has \nsupplied an intelligible principle to guide the delegee\u2019s \nuse of discretion.\u201d  Id. at 2123.  Under this frame-\nwork, the Court has approved narrow and broad delega-\ntions, acknowledging that \u201cin our increasingly complex \nsociety, replete with ever changing and more technical \nproblems, Congress simply cannot do its job absent an \nability to delegate power under broad general direc-\ntives.\u201d  Mistretta, 488 U.S. at 372; see Am. Power Light \n& Co. v. SEC, 329 U.S. 90, 105 (1946) (\u201cThe judicial ap-\nproval accorded [to] these \u2018broad\u2019 standards for admin-\nistrative action is a reflection of the necessities of mod-\nern legislation dealing with complex economic and social \nproblems.\u201d); Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v. Adkins, \n310 U.S. 381, 398 (1940).  It has further explained that \n\n90a \n \nthe nondelegation inquiry \u201calways begins (and often al-\nmost ends) with statutory interpretation.\u201d  Gundy, 588 \nU.S. at 135. \nAs such, we begin our nondelegation inquiry not with \na long discourse about the history of the USF\u2019s short-\ncomings, but with statutory interpretation.  See id.  \nIn 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254, Congress clearly set out both the \ngeneral policy\u2014ensuring \u201c[a]ccess to advanced telecom-\nmunications and information services [are] provided in \nall regions of the Nation,\u201d id. at \u00a7 254(b)(2)\u2014and the \nagency entrusted to execute that policy, the FCC, see \nAm. Power, 329 U.S. at 105.  All that leaves is the ques-\ntion of whether Congress delineated \u201cthe boundaries of \nthis delegated authority.\u201d  Id.  Petitioners argue that \nbecause \u00a7 254 sets no definite limits on how much the \nFCC can raise for the USF that it lacks any concrete, \nobjective guidance limiting this authority.  The Court \nhas rejected this argument in several formulations in \nchallenges to delegations implicating the authority to \nraise revenue.  See, e.g., Skinner v. Mid-Am. Pipeline \nCo., 490 U.S. 212, 222-23 (1989); J.W. Hampton, Jr., & \nCo. v. United States, 276 U.S. 394, 409 (1928).  For sim-\nilar reasons, Petitioners\u2019 argument should fail here.  \nExamining the plain language of \u00a7 254, it becomes clear \nthat Congress has sufficiently limited the FCC\u2019s ability \nto raise revenue in a way other than imposing a statu-\ntory cap on how much can be raised. \nSection 254(b) lays out the principles that the FCC \nmust adhere to.  It sets out the specific directive that \nthe FCC \u201cshall [create] policies for the preservation and \nadvancement of universal service.\u201d  47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(b) \n(emphasis added).  It further establishes that the FCC \nis required to do so pursuant to certain enumerated \n\n91a \n \nprinciples that:  \u201cquality services should be made avail-\nable at just and reasonable rates; advanced services \nshould be provided to the entire United States; and \u2018low-\nincome consumers and those in rural, insular, and high \ncost areas\u2019 should have access to advanced services at \nreasonably comparable rates to those in urban areas.\u201d  \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(b)(1)-(3).  Section 254(b)(5) limits the \nFCC to only enact universal service policies that are \n\u201cspecific, predictable and sufficient\u201d to \u201cpreserve and \nadvance universal service.\u201d  Id. 254(b)(5).  The stat-\nute further charges telecommunications carriers with \nthe duty to provide access that meets minimum stand-\nards of universal service to \u201c[e]lementary and secondary \nschools and classrooms, healthcare providers, and li-\nbraries.\u201d  Id. 254(b)(6). \nAs the panel noted, \u00a7 254(b)(7) \u201cenables, and likely \nobligates, [the FCC] to add principles \u2018consistent with\u2019  \n\u00a7 254\u2019s overall purpose.\u201d  Consumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, 63 \nF.4th 441, 448 (5th Cir. 2023) (quoting 47 U.S.C.  \n\u00a7 254(b)(7)), reh\u2019g en banc granted, opinion vacated, 72 \nF.4th 107 (5th Cir.).  In line with our colleagues at the \nSixth Circuit, I view \u00a7 254(b) as Congress laying out \u201ca \nhigh-level goal for universal service\u201d and then going fur-\nther to \u201cenumerate[] specific principles of universal ser-\nvice.\u201d  Consumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, 67 F.4th 773, 790-91 \n(6th Cir. 2023), cert. denied, 2024 WL 2883753 (June 10, \n2024) (Mem.).  Section 254(b) contains limiting princi-\nples that impose \u201ca mandatory duty on the FCC\u201d to con-\nsider the listed universal service principles when it up-\ndates its universal service policies.  Qwest Corp. v. \nFCC, 258 F.3d 1191, 1200 (10th Cir. 2001); see, e.g., Con-\nsumers\u2019 Rsch., 67 F.4th at 791; Consumers\u2019 Rsch., 88 \nF.4th 917, 924 (11th Cir. 2023), cert. denied, 2024 WL \n2883755 (June 10, 2024) (Mem.).  By its plain language, \n\n92a \n \nCongress ordered in \u00a7 254 that the FCC \u201cshall base pol-\nicies for the preservation and advancement of universal \nservice on the principles\u201d enumerated in \u00a7 254(b).  47 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 254(b).  This imposition of a duty to weigh the \nenumerated universal service principles is reminiscent \nof constitutional statutory delegations that provided an \nintelligible principle in the form of \u201cguidance that the \n[agency] cannot disregard.\u201d  Allstates Refractory Con-\ntractors, LLC v. Su, 79 F.4th 755, 775 (6th Cir. 2023) \n(Nalbandian, J., dissenting) (citing Mistretta, 488 U.S. \nat 375-76). \nReading \u00a7 254(b)\u2019s provisions together, as our sister \ncircuits have, \u201cindicates that Congress required that the \nFCC base its efforts to preserve and advance universal \nservice on the enumerated principles while allowing the \nFCC to then \u2018balance [each] principle[] against one an-\nother when they conflict.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Consumers\u2019 Rsch., 67 F.4th \nat 791 (quoting Qwest Corp., 258 F.3d at 1200); see also \nTex.

Thus, contrary to Petitioners\u2019 and the major-\nity\u2019s contentions, \u00a7 254(b)(7)\u2019s grant of authority to the \nFCC to devise new universal service policies based on \nprinciples that it \u201cdetermine[s] are necessary and ap-\npropriate for the protection of the public interest, con-\nvenience, and necessity\u201d does not render the other prin-\nciples meaningless.  Nor does it \u201cstrip away the intelli-\ngible principle and the limits on the FCC\u2019s discretion \nthat Congress imposed in the first six principles and \nthroughout\u201d the remainder of \u00a7 254\u2019s other provisions.  \nSee Consumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, 67 F.4th at 792.

Section 254\u2019s strictures set out from whom funds \nare exacted, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(d), who receives the benefit \nof the funds, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(e), and what minimum \nstandards of service must be provided in order to satisfy \nthe longstanding goal of providing universal service.  \nAlenco Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v.

A closer look at TOPUC II reveals \nhow a strained interpretation of our prior utterances \ndoes not support a determination that \u00a7 254 contains \u201cno \nguidance whatsoever.\u201d  Jarkesy v.

Un-\ndertaking a Chevron analysis, we asked \u201cwhether Con-\ngress has spoken directly on the precise question at is-\nsue,\u201d and then turned to whether the FCC\u2019s interpreta-\ntion of \u00a7 254 was based upon a permissible construction.  \nId. at 320-21.  Notably, we did not evaluate the consti-\ntutionality of Congress\u2019s delegation there, but consid-\nered whether the Order\u2019s price cap violated the Act\u2019s \nprinciples of ensuring \u201cjust, reasonable, and affordable \nrates\u201d of universal service.  Id. at 321 (quoting 47 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 254(b)(1), (i)).  Given the full scope of our prior \ninterpretation of \u00a7 254(b), Petitioners\u2019 overreliance on \nthese unrelated considerations to carry the day in a non-\ndelegation doctrine inquiry is unfounded. \nSection 254\u2019s other provisions provide further checks \non the FCC\u2019s discretion.  Section 254(c) limits the FCC \nin determining which telecommunications services will \nreceive support from the USF.  In \u00a7 254(c)(1), Con-\ngress specifically ordered the FCC to revise its defini-\ntion of supported services only to account for \u201cadvances \nin telecommunications and information technologies and \nservices.\u201d  Some have said that \u00a7 254(c) does not limit \nthe FCC\u2019s discretion to raise revenue because it only ad-\ndresses the spending of USF money.  However, that \n\n95a \n \ncontention neglects the direct link between the collec-\ntion of universal service contributions and the disburse-\nment of USF money.  Section 254(d) requires \u201ctelecom-\nmunications carrier[s] that provide[] interstate telecom-\nmunications services\u201d to \u201ccontribute, on an equitable \nand nondiscriminatory basis\u201d to the \u201cmechanisms estab-\nlished by the [FCC] to preserve and advance universal \nservice.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 254(d).2  As the FCC points out, the less \nmoney the telecommunications carriers require to effec-\ntively provide universal service results in \u201cless revenue \nthe FCC must raise to finance those mechanisms.\u201d \nWith respect to dispersing any money from the USF, \nthe FCC is restricted to dispersing credits to statutorily \ndesignated eligible telecommunications carriers that \nprovide support for universal services.  Id. \u00a7 254(e); see \nTOPUC I, 183 F.3d at 412 (\u201cThe term \u2018sufficient\u2019 ap-\npears in \u00a7 254(e), and the plain language of \u00a7 254(e) \nmakes sufficiency of universal service support a direct \nstatutory command rather than a statement of one of \nseveral principles.\u201d  (emphasis added)).  On more than \none occasion, we have held that \u00a7 254(e) \u201crequires that \nuniversal service support be \u2018explicit and sufficient.\u2019\u200a\u201d  \nAlenco, 201 F.3d at 614 (emphasis added).  As a practi-\ncal matter, it is worth noting that USF program dis-\nbursements have \u201cremained relatively stable over the \npast decade\u201d and even decreased from 2012 to 2020.  \nFCC, FCC 22-67, REPORT ON THE FUTURE OF THE UNI-\n \n2  As I explain in Part III, infra, that telecommunications carriers \ntypically pass through the cost of their quarterly contributions in \nthe form of line-item charges on consumers\u2019 bills on their own voli-\ntion is irrelevant to our constitutional analysis.  Cf. J.W. Hamp-\nton, 276 U.S. at 406 (describing that Congress\u2019s delegations must \nbe analyzed for the specificity and extent of vestment of discretion \nyielded to the appropriate co-ordinate branch of government). \n\n96a \n \nVERSAL SERVICE FUND 10084-85, \u00b6 92 (Aug. 15, 2022) \n(\u201cReport to Congress\u201d).  This fact flatly contradicts \nPetitioners\u2019 assertions that the FCC has acted from a \nposition \u201cthat it has a free hand to overcharge\u201d for uni-\nversal service.  Thus, I would deny the petition for re-\nview because \u00a7 254 satisfies the intelligible principle test \nas articulated by the Supreme Court. \nb. Section 254\u2019s Context, Purpose, and History \nIn Gundy, the Court stated that the intelligible prin-\nciple analysis requires examination of \u201c[t]he [statute\u2019s] \ntext, considered alongside its context, purpose, and his-\ntory.\u201d  588 U.S. at 136.  Congress\u2019s consistent intention \nto preserve and advance universal service for nearly a \ncentury, 3 combined with \u00a7 254\u2019s articulated purpose \nprovide further evidence of the existence of an intelligi-\nble principle.  Consumers\u2019 Rsch., 67 F.4th at 790-95; \nsee Am. Power, 329 U.S. at 104; TOPUC I, 183 F.3d at \n405-06.  The majority\u2019s disagreement with Congress\u2019s \npolicy choices, Maj. Op. at 26, does not transform the \nUSF into a constitutional or statutory violation.  See \nConsumers\u2019 Rsch., 63 F.4th at 449 n.4.  As the panel \nheld, \u00a7 254 does not leave the FCC with \u201cno guidance \nwhatsoever,\u201d id. at 448-49, and more befittingly, it ac-\ncords with the statute\u2019s purpose, and \u201cCongress\u2019s his-\ntory of pursuing universal service\u201d to clearly enunciate \nan intelligible principle that sufficiently cabins the \n \n3  Congress passed the FCC\u2019s organic statute in 1934 and mod-\nernized the agency\u2019s regulatory role in passing the Telecommuni-\ncations Act of 1994 \u201cto make available, so far as possible, to all the \npeople of the United States, without discrimination on the basis of \nrace, color, religion, national origin, or sex, a rapid, efficient, Na-\ntion-wide, and world-wide wire and radio communication service \nwith adequate facilities at reasonable charges.\u201d  47 U.S.C. \u00a7 151. \n\n97a \n \nFCC\u2019s discretion.  See Consumers\u2019 Rsch., 67 F.4th at \n795; Gundy, 588 U.S. at 135-36.  In sum, I would hold \nthat the context, purpose, and history surrounding \u00a7 254 \nevinces a clear intelligible principle delimiting agency \ndiscretion. \nII.  THE PRIVATE NONDELEGATION DOCTRINE \nAn agency may obtain the assistance of private par-\nties in implementing its mandate under federal law so \nlong as those private parties are subordinate to the \nagency and subject to the agency\u2019s \u201csurveillance\u201d and \nguidance.  Adkins, 310 U.S. at 388, 399; see also Bo-\nerschig v. Trans-Pecos Pipeline, LLC, 872 F.3d 701, 708 \n(5th Cir. 2017) (noting same).  Petitioners and the ma-\njority assert however, that the FCC \u201creflexively rub-\nberstamps\u201d USAC\u2019s proposals to determine the contri-\nbution rates charged to telecommunications carriers.  \nThey further posit that USAC maintains final decision-\nmaking power because \u201cthe FCC has never reversed \nUSAC\u2019s projections of demand.\u201d  Neither of these ar-\nguments is supported by the statute or applicable regu-\nlations nor do they consider well-established principles \nof administrative law.  As described below, these argu-\nments follow from misstatements of record facts. \nThe FCC determines a quarterly contribution factor \n\u201cbased on the ratio of total projected quarterly expenses \nof the universal service support mechanisms to the total \nend-user interstate and international telecommunica-\ntions revenues.\u201d  47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.709(a)(2).  Sixty days \nin advance of this determination, USAC submits its \n\u201cprojections of demand\u201d\u2014the projected expenses to en-\nsure the operation of the USF programs\u2014to the FCC.  \nId. \u00a7 54.709(a)(3).  These projections of demand for \nUSF support are subject to the FCC\u2019s imposed caps.  \n\n98a \n \nSee, e.g., Interim Cap Order, 23 FCC Rcd. 8834 (2008) \n(adopting caps on disbursements of USF contributions \nthat eligible telecommunications carriers may receive to \n\u201crein in the explosive growth in high-cost universal ser-\nvice support disbursements\u201d).  Considering the FCC\u2019s \nlimitations on USAC\u2019s proposed \u201cprojections of de-\nmand,\u201d USAC compiles the total revenues and expenses \nof the contributing carriers based on their Reporting \nWorksheets.  47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.709(a)(2).  These work-\nsheets, created by the FCC, id. \u00a7 54.711, must be sub-\nmitted for review at least thirty days before the start of \nthe quarter.  Id. \u00a7 54.709(a)(2).  USAC then calculates \nthe contribution factor from the Reporting Worksheets \nand then the ratio is publicly noticed and made available \non the FCC\u2019s website.  See id. \u00a7 54.709(a)(3).  The \nFCC then may approve the projections or administra-\ntive expense estimates or exercise its \u201cright to set pro-\njections of demand and administrative expenses.\u201d  Id.  \nWhere the FCC does not act within fourteen days of the \nrelease of the projections of demand, then the projec-\ntions and contributions are deemed approved by the \nFCC.  Id. \nThe USF and its programs receive funding only after \nthe execution of a detailed, multistep process devised by \nthe FCC.  Petitioners and the majority assert that this \nframework is evidence that the FCC merely sits on its \nhands while USAC drives the boat in determining how \nmuch is raised.  This ignores the established principle \nthat \u201can agency exercises its policymaking discretion \nwith equal force when it makes policy by either \u2018de-\ncid[ing] to act\u2019 or \u2018decid[ing] not to act.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Consumers\u2019 \nRsch., 67 F.4th at 796 (quoting Oklahoma v. United \nStates, 62 F.4th 221, 230 (6th Cir. 2023)).  Significantly, \nthe structural relationship between the agency and the \n\n99a \n \nprivate party is the focus of the private nondelegation \ndoctrine inquiry.  See Texas v. Rettig, 987 F.3d 518, 531 \n(5th Cir. 2021).  A closer look at the relationship here \nleads to the conclusion that the FCC has not ceded con-\ntrol of the USF to USAC. \nUSAC is fully subordinate to the FCC as its functions \nare strictly ministerial.  See Consumers\u2019 Rsch., 63 \nF.4th at 451-52.  Here is a short list of what USAC can \ndo.  USAC is tasked with \u201cbilling contributors, collect-\ning contributions to the universal service support mech-\nanisms, and disbursing universal service support \nfunds.\u201d  47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.702(b).  It collects information \nand facts from the contributing telecommunications \ncompanies and tabulates the companies\u2019 contribution \nfactors based on that information and the formulas that \nthe FCC furnishes for USAC to apply.  See, e.g., 47 \nC.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 54.1304(b) (establishing formula to calculate \nsafety net additive support), 54.901(a) (explaining Con-\nnect \nAmerica \nFund \nBroadband \nLoop \nSupport), \n54.303(a)(1) (setting formula to determine total eligible \noperating expenses), 54.702(n).  USAC contribution \ndeterminations are mere proposals subject to govern-\nment approval.  See Consumers\u2019 Rsch., 88 F.4th at 927.  \nAs the Court held in Adkins, a private entity\u2019s partici-\npation in ministerial functions under the agency \u201cperva-\nsive surveillance and authority\u201d does not violate the \nConstitution.  310 U.S. at 388.  Here, all of this is done \nunder the FCC\u2019s watch and is conducted only with the \nFCC\u2019s approval.  See Universal Service Contribution \nMethodology, 34 FCC Rcd. 4143, 4144-45 (2019) (citing \nConnect America Fund, 26 FCC Rcd. 17663, 17847 \n(2011)) (directing USAC to make specific contribution \ncollections \u201cregardless of the projected quarterly de-\nmand\u201d calculated from the FCC-supplied formulas). \n\n100a \n \nWith respect to the FCC\u2019s control over USAC, the \nlist of what USAC cannot do is instructive.  USAC can-\nnot make policy.  47 C.F.R \u00a7 54.702(c).  It cannot in-\nterpret unclear provisions or rules.  Id.  It cannot uni-\nlaterally give its proposals the force of law.  47 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 54.709(a)(2).  The very agency action addressed in \nthe instant petition for review is the FCC\u2019s \u201cProposed \nFirst Quarter 2022 Universal Service Contribution Fac-\ntor.\u201d  Consequently, it is inaccurate to state that USAC \ndefinitively determines how much money the USF will \ncollect each quarter.  See 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.709(a)(3).  \nThe FCC is not bound by USAC\u2019s projections.  Id.  \nUSAC acts no differently than an advisor or policy aide \nthat proposes regulations subject to government ap-\nproval.  See Adkins, 310 U.S. at 388.  Upon receiving \nUSAC\u2019s proposals, the FCC issues a Public Notice, pub-\nlishing the proposed contribution factor and soliciting \npublic comment.  47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.709(a)(3). \nWhat occurs after the FCC approves the quarterly \ncontribution factor further supports the notion that \nUSAC is fully subservient to the FCC.  The FCC main-\ntains supervision and review over USAC proposals well \nafter it issues the approved quarterly contribution fac-\ntor.4  Any party that is aggrieved by a ministerial act \n \n4  Hospitals in rural areas and libraries and schools can apply for \ndiscounted telecommunications services under the E-Rate pro-\ngram.  47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(h)(1)(A)-(B).  The hospitals, schools, and \nlibraries must post their applications on USAC\u2019s website, undergo \na technology assessment, and comply with strenuous bidding re-\nquirements as outlined by the FCC.  See Bishop Perry Middle \nSch. New Orleans, 21 FCC Rcd. 5316, 5317-18 (2006) (listing the \nrequirements for the E-Rate program as set out by Congress in  \n\u00a7 254(h) and the FCC in 47 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 54.504, 54.511(a)).  Where a \nparty fails to comply with the statutory and regulatory require-\n \n\n101a \n \nof USAC\u2014typically the issuance of an invoice to collect \ncontributions\u2014may seek review from the FCC.  47 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 54.719(b); Universal Serv. Contribution Meth-\nodology, 31 FCC Rcd. 13220 (2016) (holding that USAC \novercharged Cisco WebEx through an improper reve-\nnue calculation).  The FCC quite routinely adjusts \nUSAC proposals that deny discount rate status to public \nlibraries and schools.  See, e.g., Streamlined Resol. of \nRequests Related to Actions by the Universal Serv. Ad-\nmin. Co., 37 FCC Rcd. 5442 (2022); Alpaugh Unified \nSch. Dist., 22 FCC Rcd. 6035, 6036-37 (2007) (remanding \nUSAC proposals that reduced or denied discounted \nrates to public libraries and schools for further fact find-\ning).  USAC is not charged with reviewing applications \nto receive subsidized universal service from qualified \nhospitals, libraries, low-income consumers, rural con-\nsumers, and schools.  The FCC fulfills that role.  See \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(h)(1)(A)-(B).  We could continue to il-\nlustrate the other places in \u00a7 254 and the Code of Fed-\neral Regulations that demonstrate that the FCC is in \nthe driver\u2019s seat.  But, all of this shows that the FCC \nmaintains complete control over USAC and holds final \ndecision-making authority regarding the USF and its \nprograms. \nA comparison to a recent case where we held that a \nviolation of the private nondelegation doctrine occurred \nfurther underscores this point.  Take our recent deci-\nsion in National Horsemen\u2019s Benevolent & Protective \n \nments necessary to obtain the discount, it may seek review with the \nFCC.  See generally id.  Notably, the FCC issues the final or-\nders that analyze the requests and either grants them outright, re-\nmands them to USAC for further fact-finding, or denies them.  \nSee id. at 5327-28 (ordering clauses). \n\n102a \n \nAss\u2019n v. Black, 53 F.4th 869 (5th Cir. 2022).  There, this \ncourt was confronted with Congress\u2019s delegation of rule-\nmaking authority to a private entity, the Horseracing \nIntegrity and Safety Authority (the \u201cAuthority\u201d).  Id. \nat 872.  The statute at issue \u201cnationalize[d] the govern-\nance of the thoroughbred horseracing industry,\u201d placing \nsubstantial unchecked rulemaking power in the Author-\nity\u2019s hands.  Id. at 872.  The statute ordered the  \nAuthority\u2014and not the Federal Trade Commission \n(\u201cFTC\u201d)\u2014to establish anti-doping, medication, and \nracetrack safety programs and a scheme of sanctions, \namong many other rules carrying the force of law.  Id. \nat 882-83.  The FTC was then required by statute to af-\nfirm the Authority\u2019s proposed regulations if deemed \nconsistent with the statute.  Id. at 884-85.  This essen-\ntially placed the FTC and the Authority on the same \nground with respect to enacting rules regulating the \nhorseracing industry that carried the force of law.  See \nid. at 883.  Specifically, we stated that \u201c[a]n agency \ndoes not have meaningful oversight if it does not write \nthe rules, cannot change them, and cannot second-guess \ntheir substance.\u201d  Id. at 872. \nThat is not the case here.  Unlike the FTC in Na-\ntional Horsemen\u2019s, the FCC sets the rules and policy \ndeterminations under which USAC operates and retains \nfinal approval and review of USAC\u2019s proposals.  See \nConsumers\u2019 Rsch., 63 F.4th at 451; Consumers\u2019 Rsch., \n67 F.4th at 796-97; Consumers\u2019 Rsch., 88 F.4th at 927-\n28.  \u201cContributions to [universal service] mechanisms  \n. . .  shall be based on contributors\u2019 projected col-\nlected end-user telecommunications revenues, and on a \ncontribution factor determined quarterly by the [FCC].\u201d  \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.709(a) (emphasis added).  This case dif-\nfers from instances where courts have analyzed whether \n\n103a \n \nan agency was statutorily authorized to rely on a private \nentity for matters that exceeded ministerial tasks.  See \nSierra Club v. Lynn, 502 F.2d 43 (5th Cir. 1974).  As an \ninitial matter, those cases are inapt comparisons be-\ncause USAC serves solely ministerial functions.  And \nthe majority can point to no binding jurisprudence re-\nquiring Congress to specifically designate a private en-\ntity to aid an agency to avoid a constitutional violation. \nPut another way, this court is confronted with a clas-\nsic case where an agency enlists a private entity to assist \nwith ministerial support in the form of fee calculation \nand collection.  See, e.g., Adkins, 310 U.S. at 399 (hold-\ning a private subdelegation of ministerial or fact collect-\ning functions is valid); Oklahoma, 62 F.4th at 229 (\u201cPri-\nvate entities may serve as advisors that propose regula-\ntions.  And they may undertake ministerial functions, \nsuch as fee collection.\u201d  (internal citations omitted)). \nFurthermore, the private entity holds not even a modi-\ncum of final decision-making power.  Regrettably, the \nmajority has adopted Petitioners\u2019 exaggerated concep-\ntion of USAC\u2019s role and discretion to create a private \nnondelegation doctrine violation where none exists.  To \nthe contrary, I would hold, as the panel did, that there \nis no private-nondelegation doctrine violation. \nIII.  EXAMINING REVENUE-RAISING DELEGATIONS \nI conclude with a point of clarification regarding USF \ncontributions in the instant regulatory scheme.  Sec-\ntion 254 establishes a system of fees, not taxes.  It re-\nfers to these sums as contributions\u2014a fee for telecom-\nmunications providers to pay as a cost of doing business.  \nHowever, whether the contributions are a fee has no \nbearing on the nondelegation doctrine analysis because \ndelegations of the taxing power are not subject to \n\n104a \n \nstricter scrutiny.  See Skinner, 490 U.S. at 222.  The \nmajority\u2019s holding presents an unnecessary narrowing \n\u2014or perhaps even elimination\u2014of the distinction of \npass-through fees and taxes and drastically breaks with \nour prior precedent to proclaim that the instant case in-\nvolves a delegation of the power to tax. \na. The Difference Between Pass-Through Fees and \nTaxes \nThe Supreme Court has long differentiated taxes \nfrom fees or other efforts to generate revenue.  See, \ne.g., Twin City Nat\u2019l Bank of New Brighton v. Nebecker, \n167 U.S. 196, 202 (1897); United States v. Munoz-Flores, \n495 U.S. 385, 398 (1990).  In National Cable Television \nAss\u2019n v. United States, 415 U.S. 336, 340-41 (1974), the \nCourt distinguished fees as costs incurred \u201cincident to a \nvoluntary act,\u201d that \u201cbestow[] a benefit on the applicant, \nnot shared by other members of society.\u201d  Id.  Even \nin cases requiring \u201cheightened scrutiny,\u201d we have simi-\nlarly analyzed costs assessed to entities engaged in the \ncourse of business by legislative bodies and divined our \nown analysis for whether costs are fees or taxes.  See \nNeinast v. Texas, 217 F.3d 275, 278 (5th Cir. 2000).  An \nexamination of both the law of this circuit and the \nCourt\u2019s cases addressing this important distinction re-\nveals that the majority\u2019s analysis distinguishing taxes \nand fees invites future line-drawing that will prove to be \nunworkable. \ni.  Analyzing this Distinction under  \nCircuit Precedent \nThe majority errs by misapplying its standard to de-\ntermine what constitutes a tax to the USF contributions \nat issue.  The majority erases the established distinc-\n\n105a \n \ntions between fees, which do not implicate the Taxing \nClause, and taxes.  See Nat\u2019l Cable, 415 U.S. at 340-41.  \nI cannot condone the patent overriding of established \nprecedent from this court and our sister circuits that \nhave long held that USF contributions are fees without \nsubstantial consideration of those determinations. \nIn TOPUC I, we considered a constitutional chal-\nlenge from several wireless telecommunications compa-\nnies asserting that the USF contribution scheme vio-\nlated the Origination Clause.  183 F.3d at 426.  There, \nthe petitioning companies specifically argued that the \nconstitutional violation flowed from the FCC\u2019s require-\nment that paging carriers make contributions to the \nUSF.  Id. at 426-27.  The panel rejected this chal-\nlenge, noting that the Court has made clear that \u201ca stat-\nute [] creat[ing] a particular governmental program and \n[] rais[ing] revenue to support that program  . . .  is \nnot a \u2018Bil[l] for raising Revenue\u2019 within the meaning of \nthe Origination Clause.\u201d  183 F.3d at 426-27 (quoting \nMunoz-Flores, 495 U.S. at 398).  As to the waived Tax \nClause argument, the panel explained in dicta that \n\u201c[e]ven if [the petitioner]\u2019s Taxing Clause argument \nwere properly before us, we find no basis for reversal\u201d \nbecause \u201cthe universal service contribution qualifies as \na fee because it is a payment in support of a service \n(managing and regulating the public telecommunica-\ntions network) that confers special benefits on the [tele-\ncommunications carrier] payees.\u201d  TOPUC I, 183 F.3d \nat 427 n.52 (first citing Nat\u2019l Cable, 415 U.S. at 340; and \nthen citing Rural Tele. Coalition v. FCC, 838 F.2d 1307, \n1314 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (holding universal service contri-\nbutions as a fee supporting allocations between inter-\nstate and intrastate jurisdictions)). \n\n106a \n \nEven though the Taxing Clause and Origination \nClause analyses differ, they require consideration of es-\nsentially the same factors\u2014namely, \u201cwhether the reve-\nnues are used to primarily defray the expenses of regu-\nlating the act\u201d or whether \u201cthe revenues generated from \nthe assessment are for general revenues or for a partic-\nular program.\u201d  Id. at 427 n.51.  Nearly fifteen years \nafter TOPUC I, the D.C. Circuit rejected the same ar-\nguments presented under the Tax Clause in Rural Cel-\nlular Ass\u2019n v. FCC, 685 F.3d 1083, 1089-90 (D.C. Cir. \n2012).  It held that \u00a7 254 could not reasonably be \u201cin-\nterpreted\u201d as \u201can unconstitutional delegation of Con-\ngress\u2019s authority under the Taxing Clause  . . .  be-\ncause the assessment of contributions from carriers is \nnot a tax.\u201d  685 F.3d at 1091.  The en banc court \nshould have reached this same determination here, as \nthis dicta from TOPUC I applies in equal force. \nThe conclusion that USF contributions are valid fees \nand not impermissible taxes follows even under height-\nened scrutiny borrowed from different constitutional \nand statutory frameworks. See discussion infra Part \nII.a-b, pp. 20-23. For instance, in Texas Entertainment \nAss\u2019n, Inc. v. Hegar, 10 F.4th 495 (5th Cir. 2021), we set \nout the governing factors to determine whether an as-\nsessed contribution is a fee or a tax for the purposes of \nthe Tax Injunction Act (\u201cTJA\u201d).  Under the TJA, we \nhave favored a \u201cbroad construction of \u2018tax\u2019\u201d out of re-\nspect of preventing delays in reviewing challenges to \nrevenue raising efforts of state and local governments. \nSee Home Builders Ass\u2019n of Miss. v. City of Madison, \n143 F.3d 1006, 1011 (5th Cir. 1998). Despite the differ-\nences in the analysis presented in the TJA and taxing \npower inquiries, any distinction does not impact the fact \nthat USF contributions are not taxes under either test. \n\n107a \n \nThe Hegar panel stated that a fee:  \u201cis imposed (1) \nby an agency, not the legislature; (2) upon those it reg-\nulates, not the community as a whole; and (3) for the pur-\nposes of defraying regulatory costs, not simply for gen-\neral revenue-raising purposes.\u201d  Id. at 505-06 (quoting \nNeinast, 217 F.3d at 278).  We considered whether the \nTexas legislature\u2019s enactment of a \u201csexually oriented \nbusiness\u201d fee was a fee or a tax.  Id. at 502, 505-06.  \nWe noted that while the cost assessed to each \u201csexually \noriented business\u201d was imposed by the legislature, the \ntext made clear that the cost was imposed only on \u201csex-\nually oriented businesses\u201d to finance a program for the \nprevention of sexual assault in that industry.  Id. at \n506.  Ultimately, we concluded that a charge by a leg-\nislative body is a fee, and not a tax, where the charge is \nlevied against a specific industry sector, serves a regu-\nlatory purpose, and raises funds for a specific regulatory \nprogram.  Id. at 506-07. \nAll of the same factors are present here.  In \u00a7 254, \nCongress set out that a charge must be collected from \n\u201c[e]very telecommunications carrier that provides in-\nterstate telecommunications services.\u201d  47 U.S.C.  \n\u00a7 254(d) (emphasis added).  The contributions collected \nfrom telecommunications carriers are directed to a spe-\ncific fund and \u201cnot general revenue.\u201d  See Hegar, 10 \nF.4th at 506-07.  In fact, \u00a7 254(e) provides that these \nfunds are not universally distributed but paid only to el-\nigible telecommunications carriers that provide univer-\nsal service.  USF contributions are imposed upon a \nspecific industry\u2014telecommunications carriers\u2014and \nnot the general public.  See id.; see also TOPUC I, 183 \nF.3d at 427-28 (holding that all telecommunications  \ncarriers\u2014including those that are exempt from  \ncontributing\u2014are the beneficiaries of the program re-\n\n108a \n \nceiving the primary benefit in the form of the expansion \nof universal service).  The best support for this lies in \nthe plain language of \u00a7 254(b)(4), (d). \nBut one need not rely solely on Congress\u2019s word as \nexpressed in \u00a7 254.  A look at the USF contribution \nsystem in practice confirms who the true payors are.  \nThe class of entities that Congress orders to contribute \n\u2014those that are compelled by congressional act to actu-\nally pay this fee\u2014are the telecommunications providers \nthemselves.  A close review of the list of entities that \nmust contribute, reproduced on USAC\u2019s website, in-\ncludes landline providers, prepaid calling card provid-\ners, coaxial cable providers, telex companies, and other \ntypes of telecommunications service providers.5  Con-\nspicuously absent from \u00a7 254, this list, or from any ma-\nterial or orders of Congress or the FCC is any listing of \nthe American populace as contributors.  Thus, the ma-\njority errs in categorizing the class of contributors as \n\u201cAmerican telecommunications consumers who see USF \ncharges on their phone bills each month.\u201d  Maj. Op. at \n15.  Whether or not the telecommunications carriers \npass through that cost to consumers in the form of a line-\nitem on their bills is irrelevant to our analysis because \nwe are concerned with the constitutionality of Con-\ngress\u2019s action, not the action of independent third par-\nties that choose to pass costs along to their customers.  \nThis degree of separation between the governmental act \nand the consumers\u2019 payments should end the inquiry. \nBut if we continue, it becomes even clearer that there \nis complete overlap between the class of USF contribu-\n \n5  See 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(d); Univ. Serv. Admin. Co., Who Must Con-\ntribute, https://www.usac.org/service-providers/contributing-to-the- \nusf/who-must-contribute/ (last visited May 24, 2024). \n\n109a \n \ntors are the payors and the beneficiaries.  The general \npublic then receives an ancillary benefit in the form of \nmore affordable, standardized service.  However, the \ntelecommunications carriers receive the primary benefit \nin the forms of both direct dispersals of USF money and \npositive network economic effects that result from  \nthe proliferation of universal service.  See 47 U.S.C.  \n\u00a7 254(e); TOPUC I, 183 F.3d at 427-28 & n.52; Rural \nCellular Ass\u2019n, 685 F.3d at 1091-92; see also Mark A. \nLemley & David McGowan, Legal Implications of Net-\nwork Economic Effects, 86 CALIF. L. REV. 479, 551 \n(1998).  As we said in TOPUC I, \u201cuniversal service con-\ntributions are part of a particular program supporting \nthe expansion of, and increased access to, the public in-\nstitutional telecommunications network.  . . .  Each \n[] carrier directly benefits from a larger and larger net-\nwork and, with that in mind, Congress designed the uni-\nversal service scheme to exact payments from those \ncompanies benefiting from the provision of universal \nservice.\u201d  183 F.3d at 427-28 (emphasis added). \nIn Rural Cellular, the D.C. Circuit reached the exact \nsame conclusion regarding enhanced access to broad-\nband services.  685 F.3d at 1091-92.  It held that as \ntelecommunications providers advance universal service \n\u201cthey will benefit from the increased utility of the [basic] \nInternet [and cell services] that come[] with a greater \nnumber of users having enhanced access to\u201d those ser-\nvices.  Id. at 1090-91.  It concluded that the FCC \u201ccol-\nlected these [universal service] contributions to support \nthe expansion of universal service and no other use was \never contemplated.\u201d  Id. at 1091. \nThe majority makes much ado of the benefit that the \ngeneral public and the rural area consumers, schools, \n\n110a \n \nhospitals, and public libraries receive from USF pro-\ngrams.  Maj. Op. at 15 (\u201cThere is no overlap at all be-\ntween the class of USF beneficiaries (recipients of sub-\nsidized telecommunications services) and the class of \nUSF contributors.\u201d).  But, the majority mistakes the \nrecipients of an ancillary benefit derived from the exac-\ntion of a fee with the payor that primarily benefits from \nthe fees exacted for the purposes of funding regulatory \nefforts.  Curiously, the majority cites Trafigura Trad-\ning LLC v. United States, for the proposition that a com-\nmon fee arises \u201cin the context of \u2018value-for-value trans-\naction[s].\u2019\u200a\u201d  29 F.4th 286, 289 (5th Cir. 2022) (quoting \nErik M. Jensen, The Export Clause, 6 FLA. TAX REV. 1, \n8 (2003)). \nIts reliance on Trafigura is misplaced. The majority \nomits that we reviewed that case under the Export \nClause of the Constitution, which requires \u201capply[ing] \n\u2018heightened scrutiny\u2019  . . .  [to] strictly enforce the \nExport\u2019s Clause ban on taxes by \u2018guard[ing] against  \n. . .  the imposition of a [tax] under the pretext of fix-\ning a fee.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at 282 (citation omitted).  Looking at \nthe precedent set forth by this court and our sister cir-\ncuits, it should be apparent that USF contributions are \nfees.  TOPUC I, 183 F.3d at 427-28 & n.52; Rural Cel-\nlular, 685 F.3d at 1091-92.  Nonetheless, some remain \nunmoved to apply our established precedent and ven-\nture into crafting new formulations to analyze whether \na certain charge is a fee or not.  Once again, noting our \nrole not to directly contravene Supreme Court jurispru-\ndence, I would hold that \u00a7 254 does not implicate the tax-\ning power. \n \n\n111a \n \nb. At Every Level of Scrutiny, USF Contributions \nare Fees \nThe majority\u2019s framing of the fee inquiry miscon-\nstrues language from the Court\u2019s decision in National \nCable and numerous persuasive authorities to reach its \nresult.  It describes fees as costs:  (1) \u201cincurred \u2018inci-\ndent to a voluntary act\u2019\u200a\u201d; (2) \u201cimposed by an administra-\ntive agency upon only those persons, or entities, subject \nto its regulation for regulatory purposes\u201d; and (3) reve-\nnues the government raises to supply a benefit that in-\nures to the persons or entities paying them rather than \nto the public generally.  See Maj. Op. at 14. \nUSF contributions have nearly all of these character-\nistics.  First, they are incurred by telecommunications \ncarriers incident to the voluntary act of doing business.  \nIn National Cable, the Court categorized charges in-\ncurred as a result of a request to obtain a state license \nto practice law or medicine, or to run a broadcast sta-\ntion, as fees because they were incident to \u201ca voluntary \nact.\u201d  See 415 U.S. at 340-41.  Thus, telecommunica-\ntions providers\u2019 willing choice to engage in the industry, \nlike the cost paid for professional licensure, fits within \nthe Court\u2019s formulation of costs incurred incident to a \nvoluntary act.  Second, USF contributions are imposed \nby the legislature on telecommunications providers, and \nnot society at large for the purposes of maintaining a \nsystem of universal service that they benefit from.  See \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(d), (e) (imposing the contribution on tel-\necommunications carriers for the benefit of qualified tel-\necommunications carriers).  In this case, the majority \ncan point to nowhere in \u00a7 254 or the Code of Federal \nRegulations where Congress, the FCC, or even USAC \norder or direct telecommunications providers to pass \n\n112a \n \nalong the cost to their customers.  At most, the major-\nity points to a regulation enacted by the FCC that \nmerely notes that is not unlawful for carriers to pass on \nthe costs to consumers.  Maj. Op. at 15 (citing 47 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 54.712(a)).  That simply is not sufficient for \nour constitutional analysis that examines Congress\u2019s ac-\ntion and scrutinizes what it has set out in delegating au-\nthority.  Cf. J.W. Hampton, 276 U.S. at 406 (analyzing \nwhat Congress \u201cmay do in seeking assistance from an-\nother branch\u201d through the delegation of authority). \nThe majority cites Valero Terrestrial Corp. v. Caf-\nfrey, 205 F.3d 130, 134 (4th Cir. 2000), for the proposi-\ntion that the fact that carriers pass along the cost of con-\ntributions to consumers makes it \u201creminiscent of a \u2018clas-\nsic tax\u2019\u200a\u201d with obligations shared by the population at \nlarge.  Maj. Op. at 15.  As mentioned above, this de-\ntermination relies on the baked-in assumption that Con-\ngress or the FCC has imposed the cost on consumers. \nAgain, this simply is not supported by the plain lan-\nguage of the statute.  Section 254(d) specifically pro-\nvides that \u201c[e]very telecommunications carrier that \nprovides interstate telecommunications services\u201d must \nmake contributions.  47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(d).  Costs in-\ncurred by entities and passed down to consumers \nthrough the entities\u2019 independent business judgment \nare not taxes.6 \n \n6  See, e.g., Edye v. Robertson, 112 U.S. 580, 595 (1884) (holding \nthat a per-head charge imposed on ship owners that brought immi-\ngrants to American was a processing fee or mitigation charge, and \nnot a tax); Hugh D. Spitzer, Taxes vs. Fees:  A Curious Confu-\nsion, 38 GONZ. L. REV. 335, 337-50, 364-65 (2002) (detailing differ-\nences between taxes and different types of user charges, commod-\nities charges, and the like). \n\n113a \n \nIn my view, a strained interpretation of our applica-\nble law and liberties taken to broadly expand the defini-\ntion of a tax using distinguishable authorities should not \nstand.  But regardless of the outcome of this analysis, \nthe Court has made clear that whether a revenue-raising \ndelegation implicates the taxing power is irrelevant to a \nnondelegation doctrine challenge.  See Skinner, 490 \nU.S. at 223.  I remain unpersuaded that we should cre-\nate a sharp split with our precedent concluding that \nUSF contributions are fees, along with our sisters cir-\ncuits\u2019 same conclusions.  Nor do I support our depar-\nture from the sound reasoning of the Court that any dis-\ntinction of a charge as a fee or tax is of little relevance \nas it pertains to the nondelegation doctrine analysis. \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nIn sum, \u00a7 254 represents Congress\u2019s effort to \u201cob-\ntain[] the assistance of its coordinate Branches\u201d7 in an \nextensive and vastly changing subject matter area.  In \nso doing, Congress has provided the FCC with an intel-\nligible principle that sufficiently delimits the FCC\u2019s dis-\ncretion based on the established universal service prin-\nciples.  Petitioners\u2019 argument that this revenue-raising \ndelegation is subject to a higher standard of scrutiny has \nbeen consistently rejected by the Supreme Court.  Be-\ncause I am not persuaded that we should deviate from \nSupreme Court precedent, deviate from our precedent, \nand create a split with the Sixth, Eleventh, and D.C. Cir-\ncuits by departing from the solid reasoning offered in \ntheir denials of those nondelegation doctrine challenges, \nI would affirm our original holding that \u00a7 254 satisfies \nthe intelligible principle test and that no constitutional \n \n7  Mistretta, 488 U.S. at 372. \n\n114a \n \nviolation arises from the FCC\u2019s subdelegation of minis-\nterial tasks to USAC. \n \n\n115a \n \nSTEPHEN A. HIGGINSON, Circuit Judge, joined by \nSTEWART, SOUTHWICK, GRAVES, and DOUGLAS, Circuit \nJudges, dissenting: \nThe majority finds neither an unconstitutional dele-\ngation of legislative power nor an unconstitutional exer-\ncise of government power by a private entity.  Su-\npreme Court precedent dictates these answers, which is \nwhy every other circuit to consider these questions \nstopped there and the Supreme Court denied petitions \nfor review of those decisions.  Consumers\u2019 Rsch. v. \nFCC, No. 23-456, 2024 WL 2883753 (U.S. June 10, 2024) \n(Mem.); Consumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, No. 23-743, 2024 WL \n2883755 (U.S. June 10, 2024) (Mem.). \nBut our court does not stop there, going beyond even \npetitioners\u2019 arguments to adopt a novel theory that it is \n\u201cthe combination\u201d of these two non-violations that \u201cvio-\nlates the Legislative Vesting Clause in Article I, \u00a7 1.\u201d  \nMaj. Op. at 55.  That is, according to the majority, \nwhen Congress provides an intelligible principle to \nchannel agency discretion (constitutional) and a private \nentity performs calculations under the agency\u2019s super-\nvision (also constitutional), it becomes\u2014pursuant to an \nundefined, unannounced, and unprecedented test\u2014 \nunconstitutional.  Make no mistake, there is nothing \nnarrow about this ruling.  This decision invites lower \ncourts to leapfrog the Supreme Court; creates a split \nwith all other circuits to have considered the issue; ig-\nnores statutory criteria and regulations; and upends the \npolitical branches\u2019 decades-long engagement with each \nother, industry, and consumers to address the technol-\nogy divide. \n \n \n\n116a \n \nI. \nThe majority argues that the \u201ccombination\u201d theory \non which its holding rests is nothing new.  But the Su-\npreme Court has considered cases that, like this one, in-\nvolved challenges on the grounds that there was both an \nunconstitutional delegation of legislative power and an \nunconstitutional delegation of government power to a \nprivate entity, yet the Court never instructed, as the ma-\njority does now, that a different standard applies.  See, \ne.g., Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U.S. 238, 311 (1936); \nCurrin v. Wallace, 306 U.S. 1, 15-16 (1939); Sunshine \nAnthracite Coal Co. v. Adkins, 310 U.S. 381, 399 (1940). \nIn Sunshine Anthracite, for example, challengers ar-\ngued that there was both an impermissible delegation of \nlegislative power to an executive commission and an im-\npermissible delegation of government power to a private \nentity because that commission relied on private actors. \n310 U.S. at 397-99.  The Supreme Court rejected the \nlegislative delegation challenge after concluding that \u201cin \nthe hands of experts the criteria which Congress ha[d] \nsupplied [we]re wholly adequate for carrying out the \ngeneral policy and purpose of the Act.\u201d  Id. at 398.  It \nthen rejected the private delegation challenge after con-\ncluding that the private actors \u201cfunction subordinately \nto the Commission,\u201d which had \u201cauthority and surveil-\nlance\u201d over them.  Id. at 399.  It ended its analysis of \nboth delegation challenges there.  If the majority were \ncorrect that a different standard applies, the Supreme \nCourt would have instead asked whether, despite consti-\ntuting neither a delegation of legislative power nor a del-\negation of government power to a private entity, there \nwas still a constitutional problem.  It did not.  The \nmajority attempts to distinguish on the ground that the \n\n117a \n \nSupreme Court \u201cfound the Government had not dele-\ngated any legislative power to any private entity\u201d and \n\u201c[t]here cannot be a combined public/private delegation \nwithout a private delegation.\u201d  Maj. Op. at 68.  But \nthat is no answer.  Indeed, it directly undermines the \nmajority\u2019s conclusion because the majority also does not \nfind a private delegation.  Id. at 17 (explaining the \ncourt \u201cneed not definitively answer either delegation \nquestion\u201d). \nThe majority points to presidential removal authority \nprecedent but ignores how the Supreme Court itself has \ncharacterized that precedent.  In Seila Law LLC v. \nCFPB, a decade after Free Enterprise Fund, it ex-\nplained that there were only two exceptions to the pres-\nident\u2019s otherwise \u201cunrestricted removal power.\u201d 591 \nU.S. 197, 204 (2020).  The CFPB\u2019s structure fit into nei-\nther exception.  Id.  The Court declined to create a \nnew one and, unlike the majority here, applied prece-\ndent.  Id.  It was not, as the majority recasts it, a sit-\nuation in which \u201c[t]wo lines of precedent seemed to con-\nverge to suggest the removal restriction at issue posed \nno constitutional problem\u201d but \u201cthe combination\u201d of fea-\ntures was unconstitutional.  Maj. Op. at 56.1  And, as \ndiscussed above, the Supreme Court has considered this \ncombination of features and, applying the legislative \ndelegation and private delegation tests the majority dis-\nregards, has found no constitutional defect. \n \n1  In doing so, the majority quotes Justice Thomas\u2019s separate \nwriting in which he disagreed with seven Justices that severing the \nremoval provision cured the CFPB\u2019s constitutional defect.  But \nthat analysis, joined by only one other Justice, about when sever-\nance is a proper remedy has little purchase here in determining \nwhether there has been a constitutional violation in the first place. \n\n118a \n \nEven if the majority were correct that the presiden-\ntial removal authority cases now suggest that a different \nstandard could apply in this case, the Supreme Court \nhas been clear that, where its precedent \u201chas direct ap-\nplication in a case,\u201d \u201cthe Court of Appeals should follow \nthe case which directly controls, leaving to [it] the pre-\nrogative of overruling its own decisions.\u201d  Agostini v. \nFelton, 521 U.S. 203, 237 (1997) (quoting Rodriguez de \nQuijas v. Shearson/Am. Exp., Inc., 490 U.S. 477, 484 \n(1989)); see also Consumers\u2019 Rsch. v. Consumer Prod. \nSafety Comm\u2019n, 91 F.4th 342, 352 (5th Cir. 2024) (\u201c[O]ur \nrole in the judicial architecture requires us only to map \n\u2014not adjust\u2014the borders\u201d of Supreme Court prece-\ndent).  The majority ignores this repeated instruction. \nII. \nThe majority cannot prevail under legislative delega-\ntion or private delegation precedent, and so it concocts \na theory to rewrite both.  In doing so, it offers no test \nfor determining when something that is neither an un-\nconstitutional delegation of legislative power from Con-\ngress to an agency nor an unconstitutional delegation of \ngovernment power to a private entity becomes unconsti-\ntutional, leaving the political branches powerless to gov-\nern. \nOn the issue of legislative delegation, the majority \nacknowledges that \u201cthe Supreme Court\u2019s nondelegation \n\u2018jurisprudence has been driven by a practical under-\nstanding that in our increasingly complex society, re-\nplete with ever changing and more technical problems, \nCongress simply cannot do its job absent an ability to \ndelegate power under broad general directives.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Maj. \nOp. at 29 (quoting Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. \n361, 372 (1989) (added emphasis omitted)).  It then as-\n\n119a \n \nserts, without explanation, that \u201cCongress did not dele-\ngate because FCC has some superior technical know-\nledge about the optimal amount of universal service \nfunding\u201d as \u201c[n]o such knowledge exists because deter-\nmining the ideal size of a welfare program involves pol-\nicy judgments, not technical ones.\u201d  Id. at 30. \nBut Congress designed a vital, nationwide program \nin an area\u2014telecommunications\u2014where the only con-\nstant has been rapid change in both technology and mar-\nkets.  This is exactly the type of \u201cever changing\u201d and \n\u201ctechnical problem[]\u201d that the Supreme Court has held \nCongress can address with \u201cbroad general directives\u201d to \nexpert agencies.  Mistretta, 488 U.S. at 372.  Congress \nchose not to freeze in place precise rates for different \ntypes of customers in different regions nor to impose \nservice technology standards that would almost imme-\ndiately become obsolete.  Instead, Congress made pol-\nicy decisions about how those precise answers should be \nreached, and regularly revisited, by the expert agency it \nhad created.  To determine which services to fund, \nFCC is required to account for which services \u201care es-\nsential to education, public health, or public safety\u201d; \n\u201csubscribed to by a substantial majority of residential \ncustomers\u201d; \u201cbeing deployed in public telecommunica-\ntions networks by telecommunications carriers\u201d; and \n\u201cconsistent with the public interest, convenience, and \nnecessity.\u201d  47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(c)(1).  Congress provided \nadditional principles to guide FCC.  For example, Con-\ngress made the policy decision that rural Americans \nshould not be abandoned on the wrong side of the tech-\nnology divide.  Without the ability to predict what \ntypes of services urban Americans would have access to \nand what rates they would pay, Congress decided to re-\nquire FCC to ensure that rural Americans have \u201caccess \n\n120a \n \nto telecommunications and information services\u201d \u201crea-\nsonably comparable to those services provided in urban \nareas and that are available at rates that are reasonably \ncomparable to rates charged for similar services in ur-\nban areas.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 254(b)(3).  The majority offers Con-\ngress no guidance on how it should address this rapidly \nevolving area, or any number of others, differently. \nThe majority is mistaken to suggest that these are \nissues that have been withdrawn from congressional \nscrutiny\u2014and attendant public debate\u2014because Con-\ngress has enlisted FCC\u2019s expertise to address them.  \nThere have been congressional hearings, reports, pro-\nposed bills, and engagement with FCC over every as-\npect of the Universal Service Fund (USF), ranging from \nrevising the High Cost Program\u2019s performance goals to \nexpanding the list of eligible entities for the Rural \nHealth Care Program to broadening the contribution \nbase for the USF.  PATRICIA FIGLIOLA, CONG. RSCH. \nSERV., R47621, THE FUTURE OF THE UNIVERSAL SER-\nVICE FUND AND RELATED BROADBAND PROGRAMS 12-\n16 (2024) (\u201cFUTURE OF THE UNIVERSAL SERVICE \nFUND\u201d).  The USF remains subject to extensive con-\ngressional efforts to weigh competing policy priorities \nand interests, balancing concerns of different consum-\ners and industries. \nOn private delegation, too, the majority ignores both \nprecedent and facts.  The Universal Service Adminis-\ntrative Company (USAC), constrained by comprehen-\nsive regulations, \u201cbill[s] contributors, collect[s] contri-\nbutions to the universal service support mechanisms, \nand disburs[es] universal service support funds.\u201d  47 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 54.702(b).  In performing these administra-\ntive functions, USAC \u201cmay not make policy, interpret \n\n121a \n \nunclear provisions of the statute or rules, or interpret \nthe intent of Congress.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 54.702(c). \nYet, the majority asserts that FCC has \u201cde facto if \nnot de jure\u201d abdicated government power to USAC be-\ncause FCC has rarely rejected the contribution factor \nthat USAC calculates based on collected inputs.  Maj. \nOp. at 7.  But the relevant question is what the major-\nity discounts as only the \u201cde jure\u201d one:  Whether FCC \nhas the \u201cauthority\u201d to do so.  Sunshine Anthracite, 310 \nU.S. at 399.  And even the majority acknowledges that \nFCC does have that authority.  See Maj. Op. at 6 \n(\u201cTrue, FCC \u2018reserves the right to set projections of de-\nmand and administrative expenses at amounts that [it] \ndetermines will serve the public interest.\u2019  See 47 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 54.709(a)(3).\u201d).  Certainly, any number of pri-\nvate entities that perform administrative roles at gov-\nernment direction and under government control would \nfail this rewritten test.

Nor does it con-\nvert USAC\u2019s accounting role into a constitutional viola-\ntion.2 \nAdditionally, the majority overlooks the fact that the \nincreasing contribution factor is not caused by the scope \nof USAC\u2019s authority but is instead driven \u201cin large part \n[by] a decline in the contributions revenue base, i.e., pro-\nviders are reporting a declining share of telecommuni-\ncations revenues and an increasing share of non-tele-\ncommunications revenues.\u201d  FUTURE OF THE UNIVER-\nSAL SERVICE FUND at 9.

But, even granting that this were historically accurate \nand the relevant question, the majority acknowledges that there \nwas an \u201cassum[ption] that ministerial tasks could be subdelegated,\u201d \nand so this argument fails because, as discussed above, USAC per-\nforms only ministerial tasks.

Put differently, the body \nconstitutionally tasked with addressing the policy prob-\nlem the majority identifies is doing just that. \nAs our unanimous panel and every other court to \nhave considered these issues held, each challenge fails \nunder binding Supreme Court legislative delegation and \nprivate delegation precedent.  Yet the majority, in un-\ndermining both lines of precedent, offers no test for de-\ntermining at what point something that is neither an un-\nconstitutional delegation of legislative power nor an un-\nconstitutional delegation of government power to a pri-\nvate entity still becomes, convergingly, unconstitutional. \nCongress, the Executive, and courts in our circuit are \nleft only with the implication that the bar for what is an \nintelligible principle is raised\u2014by how much is unclear \n\u2014when an agency enlists a private entity to perform ac-\ncounting tasks.  Conversely, tasks performed by pri-\nvate entities that have long been considered ministerial \nwill be elevated\u2014at what point, again, is unclear\u2014to ex-\nercises of government power when Congress legislates \nwith otherwise permissibly intelligible principles that \nlimit agency discretion. \nThis convergence sleight of hand not only undoes Su-\npreme Court precedent but also leaves the political \nbranches powerless to address this perceived constitu-\ntional deficiency, ignorant as to how to legislate and reg-\nulate in ways that will survive judicial review.

STEWART, Circuit Judge: \nConsumers\u2019 Research, along with other entities, (col-\nlectively \u201cPetitioners\u201d) challenge:  (1) the constitution-\nality of Congress\u2019s delegation of administration of the \nUniversal Service Fund (the \u201cUSF\u201d) to the Federal Com-\nmunications Commission (the \u201cFCC\u201d); and (2) the FCC\u2019s \nsubsequent reliance on a private entity for ministerial \n\n126a \n \nsupport.  Because there are no nondelegation doctrine \nviolations, we DENY their petition. \nI.  BACKGROUND \nCongress enacted \u00a7 254 of the Telecommunications \nAct of 1996, which established the USF and entrusted \nits administration to the FCC.  Congress passed \u00a7 254 \nto ensure the facilitation of broad access to telecommu-\nnications services across the country.  The USF ac-\ncomplishes this goal by raising funds which are later dis-\ntributed to people, entities, and projects to expand and \nadvance telecommunications services in the nation.  \nFunds are raised by periodic contributions to the USF \nfrom telecommunications carriers, who later pass those \ncosts on to consumers via line-item charges in their \nmonthly bills. \nThe FCC relies on a private entity, the Universal \nService Administrative Company (\u201cUSAC\u201d), to aid it in \nits administration of the USF.  USAC is comprised of \nindustry experts and the FCC tasks it with certain min-\nisterial responsibilities, including:  (1) collecting self-\nreported income information from telecommunications \ncarriers; (2) compiling data to formulate the potential \ncontribution rate for the USF; and (3) proposing a quar-\nterly budget to the FCC for the USF\u2019s continued preser-\nvation.  USAC proposals are approved by the FCC ei-\nther expressly or after fourteen days of agency inaction. \nUSAC submitted its 2022 first quarter projections to \nthe FCC on November 2, 2021.  The FCC published \nthese projections for notice-and-comment in accordance \nwith the Administrative Procedure Act.  On November \n19, 2021, Petitioners submitted comments challenging \nthe constitutionality of the USF and the FCC\u2019s reliance \non USAC.  The FCC weighed the comments and issued \n\n127a \n \na Public Notice of Proposed First Quarter 2022 Univer-\nsal Service Contribution Factor (\u201cthe Proposal\u201d).  Pe-\ntitioners filed another comment, invoking the same ar-\nguments as their November comment and seeking the \ndiscontinuance of the USF.  The FCC, nonetheless, ap-\nproved USAC\u2019s proposal on December 27, 2021.  In re-\nsponse, Petitioners filed this petition on January 5, 2022. \nOn appeal, Petitioners assert that:  (1) the Hobbs \nAct is not a jurisdictional bar to their constitutional \nclaims; (2) Section 254 violates the nondelegation doc-\ntrine because Congress failed to supply the FCC with an \nintelligible principle; and (3) the FCC\u2019s relationship with \nUSAC violates the private nondelegation doctrine be-\ncause the FCC does not adequately subordinate USAC \nin its administration of the USF. \nII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW \nThis court reviews constitutional issues stemming \nfrom an agency\u2019s action de novo.  See Huwaei Tech \nUSA, Inc. v. FCC, 2 F.4th 421, 434 (5th Cir. 2021).  We \n\u201chold unlawful and set aside\u201d any agency action that is \n\u201ccontrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or im-\nmunity.\u201d  Id. (citing 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(B)). \nIII.  DISCUSSION \nA.  Jurisdiction \nThe Hobbs Act \u201cprovides that a party aggrieved by a \nrule, regulation, or final order  . . .  must file a peti-\ntion for judicial review within sixty days.\u201d  State of Tex. \nv. United States, 749 F.2d 1144, 1146 (5th Cir. 1985).  \nThis sixty-day period \u201cis jurisdictional and cannot be ju-\ndicially altered or expanded.\u201d  City of Arlington v. \nFCC, 668 F.3d 229, 237 (5th Cir. 2012).  However, \nplaintiffs may \u201cchallenge  . . .  a regulation after the \n\n128a \n \nlimitations period has expired if the claim is that the \nagency has exceeded its constitutional authority or stat-\nutory authority.\u201d  State v. Rettig, 987 F.3d 518, 529 (5th \nCir. 2021).  \u201cTo sustain such a challenge, the claimant \nmust show some direct, final agency action involving the \nparticular plaintiff within [sixty days] of filing suit.\u201d  \nId. (quoting Dunn-McCampbell Royalty Int., Inc. v. \nNat\u2019l Park Serv., 112 F.3d 1283, 1287 (5th Cir. 1997)).  \nAn agency\u2019s action is direct and final when two criteria \nare satisfied:  First, the action must mark the \u201ccon-\nsummation of the agency\u2019s decisionmaking process  \n. . .  [and] second, the action must be one by which \nrights or obligations have been determined, or from \nwhich legal consequences will flow.\u201d  Dunn-McCampbell, \n112 F.3d at 1287 (internal quotation and citation omit-\nted). \nThe FCC contends that Petitioners\u2019 claims are time-\nbarred by the Hobbs Act because:  (1) any challenge to \n\u00a7 254 should have come when Congress originally en-\nacted it and (2) the Proposal is not a direct and final \nagency action which creates legal consequences or new \nobligations for Petitioners.  The FCC relies on Dunn-\nMcCampbell, where we foreclosed a facial challenge to \na National Park Service regulation because \u201cthe limita-\ntions period beg[an] to run when the agency publishe[d] \nthe regulation in the Federal Register.\u201d  Id.  But we \nalso carved out a limited exception in that case when we \nrecognized that \u201can agency\u2019s application of a rule to a \nparty creates a new  . . .  cause of action to the \nagency\u2019s constitutional or statutory authority.\u201d  Id.  \nPetitioners assert that they qualify for this exception.  \nWhether they are correct depends on our determination \nthat the Proposal:  (1) constitutes application of a direct \nand final rule by the FCC; and (2) determines Petition-\n\n129a \n \ners\u2019 rights or has legal consequences for non-compliance.  \nWe hold in Petitioners\u2019 favor on both prongs.   \nHere, the Proposal qualifies for the Dunn-McCamp-\nbell exception because it (1) is a direct and final order \nwhich consummates the FCC\u2019s decisionmaking process; \nand (2) punishes telecommunications carriers for non-\ncompliance.  See 112 F.3d at 1287.  Regarding prong \none, the Proposal is distinguishable from the regulation \nin Dunn-McCampbell.  In that case, we held that \nDunn-McCampbell\u2019s facial challenge was time barred \nbecause the \u201cPark Service ha[d] not yet applied the reg-\nulations to the companies.\u201d  Id. at 1288-89.  So, any \nchallenge he brought before the Park Service ever ap-\nplied the regulation was necessarily a challenge to the \nregulation itself.  The reverse is true in the instant \ncase, where the FCC has applied and reapplied \u00a7 254\u2019s \nmandatory USF Contributions through its approval of \nthe quarterly proposals.  Each approval consummates \nthe FCC\u2019s decisionmaking process for that quarter and, \nthus, allows for a constitutional challenge if that chal-\nlenge is brought within the sixty-day time limit. \nProng two is also satisfied because the Proposal un-\ndoubtedly has legal consequences which flow to carriers \nthat fail to meet their contribution obligations.  See 47 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 54.713(b) (providing that \u201cdelinquent\u201d USF \ncontributors are subject to \u201cinterest at the rate equal to \nthe U.S. prime rate  . . .  plus 3.5 percent, as well as \nadministrative charges of collection and/or penalties and \ncharges permitted by the applicable law\u201d).  Because \nPetitioners satisfy both Dunn-McCampbell prongs, the \nHobbs Act does not bar their constitutional claims and \nwe proceed to the merits of their nondelegation argu-\nments.  112 F.3d at 1287; Rettig, 987 F.3d at 529. \n\n130a \n \nB.  Nondelegation \nArticle I of the United States Constitution provides \nthat \u201c[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted shall be \nvested in a Congress of the United States.\u201d  \u201cAccompa-\nnying that assignment of power  . . .  is a bar on its \nfurther delegation.\u201d  Gundy v. United States, 139  \nS. Ct. 2116, 2123 (2019) (internal quotations and citation \nomitted).  However, the Constitution does not deny \nCongress the necessary \u201cflexibility and practicality\u201d to \nperform its functions.  Id.  The Supreme Court has, \ntherefore, recognized that \u201cCongress may obtain the as-\nsistance of its coordinate Branches  . . .  and in par-\nticular, may confer substantial discretion on executive \nagencies to implement and enforce the laws.\u201d  Id.  \n(quoting Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 372 \n(1989)). \nTo that end, the Constitution only requires Congress \nto provide an intelligible principle which adequately \nguides the Executive agency.  See id. (holding \u201cthat a \nstatutory delegation is constitutional as long as Con-\ngress lays down by legislative act an intelligible princi-\nple to which the person or body authorized to exercise \nthe delegated authority is directed to conform\u201d) (inter-\nnal quotations and citation omitted). \nThe intelligible principle standard is \u201cnot demand-\ning.\u201d  Id. at 2129.  The Supreme Court has rarely \n\u201csecond-guess[ed] Congress regarding the permissible \ndegree of policy judgment that can be left to those exe-\ncuting or applying the law.\u201d  Id.  Ultimately, \u201ca non-\ndelegation inquiry always begins (and often almost \nends) with statutory interpretation.  The constitutional \nquestion is whether Congress has supplied an intelligi-\nble principle to guide the delegee\u2019s use of discretion.\u201d  \n\n131a \n \nId.  Put differently, we must construe \u00a7 254 to discern \nwhat tasks it delegates and what instructions Congress \nprovided therein.  \u201cOnly after [we have] determined  \n[\u00a7 254\u2019s] meaning can [we] decide whether the law suffi-\nciently guides executive discretion to accord with Article \nI.\u201d  Id \nWe recently grappled with the intelligible principle \nstandard in Jarkesy v. SEC, 34 F.4th 446 (5th Cir. 2022).1  \nIn that case, we held that Congress failed to provide an \nintelligible principle when it gave \u201cthe SEC the ability \nto determine which subjects of its enforcement actions \nare entitled to Article III proceedings with a jury trial, \nand which are not.\u201d  Id. at 461.  We acknowledged that \nthe Supreme Court \u201chas not in the past several decades \nheld that Congress failed to provide a requisite intelligi-\nble principle.\u201d  Id. at 462.  But we also noted that the \nCourt had not been presented an instance where \u201cCon-\ngress offered no guidance whatsoever\u201d to an executive \nagency in that same span of time.  Id.  (emphasis in orig-\ninal).  Accordingly, we reasoned that \u201c[i]f the intelligi-\nble principle standard means anything, it must mean \nthat a total absence of guidance is impermissible under \nthe Constitution.\u201d  Id. \nIn Jarkesy, we stated that the nondelegation doc-\ntrine applies where Congress has provided \u201cno guid-\nance whatsoever\u201d to an agency, Id. at 462 (emphasis in \noriginal), citing to the most recent (though long ago)  \nSupreme Court nondelegation violation decision.  See \n \n1  We have since denied petition to rehear this case before the en \nbanc court.  See Jarkesy v. SEC, 51 F.4th 644.  On March 8, 2023, \nthe Government filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the Su-\npreme Court.  Jarkesy\u2019s response to that petition is due April 10, \n2023. \n\n132a \n \nPanama Refining Co. v. Ryan, 293 U.S. 388, 405 (1935) \n(holding that there was a nondelegation violation when \nCongress gave the President broad authority to prohibit \nthe transportation of oil-related products in interstate \ncommerce, but failed to provide any policy, establish any \nstandard, or lay down any rules to direct the President\u2019s \nexercise of this authority). \nHaving fleshed out what the intelligible principle \nstandard requires, we now examine Petitioners\u2019 asser-\ntions that \u00a7 254 violates the nondelegation doctrine be-\ncause:  (1) Congress failed to provide the FCC with an \nintelligible principle; and (2) to the extent Congress pro-\nvided intelligible principles, they are merely aspira-\ntional and place no objective limits on the FCC in its ad-\nministration of the USF. \n1.  Whether Congress Provided Intelligible  \nPrinciples in \u00a7 254 \nPetitioners argue that Congress has unconstitution-\nally delegated its authority to the FCC without provid-\ning an intelligible principle.  For example, they point to \nthe absence of a limit on how much the FCC can raise \nfor the USF as evidence of a lack of proper guidance.  \nWith no objective ceiling on the amount that the FCC \ncan raise each quarter, they contend that Congress\u2019s al-\nleged intelligible principles fail to place necessary limits \non the FCC\u2019s ability to assess fees from telecommunica-\ntions carriers.  Also, Petitioners aver that \u00a7 254(b)(1)-(7) \ncontains mere public policy statements which impose no \nmeaningful limitations on or guidance to the FCC\u2019s  \nrevenue-raising obligation in its administration of the \nUSF.  In sum, Petitioners maintain that Congress has \nnot articulated any guidance to the FCC in its admin-\n\n133a \n \nistration of the USF\u2014and that this failure violates the \nnondelegation doctrine.  We disagree. \nCongress passed \u00a7 254 for the express purpose of \npreserving and advancing universal telecommunications \nservices.2  See 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(b).  To that end, \u00a7 254(b) \nprovides that the FCC \u201cshall base policies\u201d on certain \nenumerated principles.3  Petitioners maintain that these \nprinciples offer no guidance to the FCC as it attempts \nto realize \u00a7 254(b)\u2019s purpose.  Their position is untena-\nble.  Section 254 expressly requires the FCC to ensure \nthat telecommunications services are:  (1) of decent \nquality and reasonably priced; (2) equally available in \nrural and urban areas; (3) supported by state and fed-\neral mechanisms; (4) funded in an equitable and nondis-\ncriminatory manner; (5) established in important public \nspaces (schools, healthcare providers, and libraries); \nand (6) available broadly across all regions in the nation.  \nSee \u00a7 254(b)(1)-(7).  And should the FCC ever conclude \nthat these principles were insufficient, the statute ena-\nbles, and likely obligates, it to add principles \u201cconsistent \nwith\u201d \u00a7 254\u2019s overall purpose.  See \u00a7 254(b)(7).  Rather \nthan leave the FCC with \u201cno guidance whatsoever,\u201d \nCongress provided ample direction for the FCC in \u00a7 254.  \nJarkesy, 34 F.4th at 462. \n \n \n \n2  See also 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 (noting the FCC\u2019s original purpose of \ncreating policies designed \u201cto make available, so far as possible, to \nall the people of the United States  . . .  a rapid, efficient, Na-\ntion-wide  . . .  wire and radio communication service with ade-\nquate facilities at reasonable charges\u201d). \n3  See 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(b)(1)-(7) (providing a full list of principles). \n\n134a \n \nUltimately, in enacting \u00a7 254, Congress chose to \n\u201cconfer substantial discretion\u201d over administration of \nthe USF to the FCC.  Gundy, 139 S. Ct. at 2139.  Peti-\ntioners take issue with how the FCC uses this discre-\ntion\u2014arguing that the FCC operates the USF with no \nguidance from Congress.4  But if the FCC had a ques-\ntion about how to manage the USF, it need only look to \n\u00a7 254 to find an answer.  Therefore, we conclude that \nCongress supplied the FCC with intelligible principles \nwhen it tasked the agency with overseeing the USF.  \nHaving established that \u00a7 254 contains intelligible prin-\nciples, we next consider whether those principles ade-\nquately limit the FCC\u2019s revenue raising function. \n2.  Whether \u00a7 254 Properly Limits the FCC \nPetitioners contend that even if Congress provided \nthe FCC with intelligible principles we should rule in \n \n4  We note that much of Petitioners\u2019 nondelegation argument re-\nlies primarily on the dissents of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in \nGundy and this court\u2019s in Rettig, which, of course, are not binding \non our court.  See, e.g., Gundy, 139 S. Ct. at 2133, 2134, 2135-37 (Gor-\nsuch, J., joined by Roberts, C.J., and Thomas, J. dissenting); see \nalso Rettig, 993 F.3d at 408, 409-10 (5th Cir. 2021) (Ho, J. joined by \nJones, Smith, Elrod, and Duncan, JJ., dissenting from denial of re-\nhearing en banc).  That some Justices of the Supreme Court and \nsome judges of this circuit have opined on whether Congress is per-\nmitted to delegate \u201cdifficult policy choices\u201d is not determinative \nthat Congress impermissibly did so here when it delegated admin-\nistration of the USF to the FCC.  Moreover, the mere fact that \nPetitioners dispute the policy choices that the FCC has made in \noverseeing the USF does not translate to a constitutional or statu-\ntory violation.  See Gundy, 139 S. Ct. at 2139 (\u201cCongress may con-\nfer substantial discretion on executive agencies to implement and \nenforce the laws.\u201d).  At best, Petitioners argue for different policy \nchoices.  But they provide no binding law to support such a re-\nquest. \n\n135a \n \ntheir favor because those principles are nothing more \nthan \u201cvague aspirations\u201d that fail to set objective limits \non the FCC as they operate the USF.  Gundy, 139  \nS. Ct. at 2133.  They argue that \u00a7 254 is no different than \nthe statute in Panama Refining.5  In that case, the Su-\npreme Court took issue with 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 701\u2019s generally \nunhelpful guidance to the President as he tried to regu-\nlate the interstate hot oil industry.  See Panama Re-\nfining, 293 U.S. at 419 (observing that \u00a7 701 failed to \n\u201climit[] or control[] the authority conferred\u201d to the Pres-\nident).  Petitioners argue that \u00a7 254 similarly fails to \nlimit or control the FCC\u2019s ability to raise revenue for the \nUSF.  We disagree. \nHere, \u00a7 254 provides limitations on the FCC\u2019s  \nrevenue-raising ability, whereas the statute in Panama \nRefining is markedly different.  In Panama Refining, \nthe Supreme Court observed that: \nThe Congress left the matter to the President with-\nout standard or rule, to be dealt with as he pleased.  \nThe effort by ingenious and diligent construction to \nsupply a criterion still permits such a breadth of au-\nthorized action as essentially to commit to the Presi-\ndent the functions of a Legislature rather than those \n \n5  See 293 U.S. at 417 (stating that the purpose of the challenges \nstatute was \u201cto eliminate unfair competitive practices, to promote \nthe fullest possible utilization of the present productive capacity of \nindustries, to avoid undue restriction of production (except as may \nbe temporarily required), to increase the consumption of industrial \nand agricultural products by increasing purchasing power, to re-\nduce and relieve unemployment, to improve standards of labor, and \notherwise to rehabilitate industry and to conserve natural re-\nsources.\u201d) (internal quotations omitted). \n\n136a \n \nof an executive or administrative officer executing a \ndeclared legislative policy. \n293 U.S. at 418-19 (emphasis added).  Section 254 con-\ntains no such deficiencies, and certainly did not leave the \nmatter to the FCC \u201cwithout standard or rule, to be dealt \nwith as [it] pleased.\u201d  Id.  Instead, \u00a7 254 requires that \nthe FCC only raise enough revenue to satisfy its pri-\nmary function.  See \u00a7 254(b). \nFor example, \u00a7 254(c)(1)(A)-(D) limits distribution of \nUSF funds to telecommunications services that:  (1) \n\u201care essential to education, public health, or public safety;\u201d \n(2) \u201care being deployed in public telecommunications \nnetworks by telecommunications carriers;\u201d and (3) \u201care \nconsistent with the public interest, convenience, and ne-\ncessity.\u201d  Likewise, \u00a7 254(b)(5) requires that the FCC \nensure there are \u201cspecific, predictable and sufficient \nFederal and State mechanisms to preserve and advance \nuniversal service.\u201d  Furthermore, \u00a7 254(e) limits distri-\nbution of USF funds to eligible communication carriers \nunder \u00a7 214(e)\u2014and even those carriers may only re-\nceive support \u201csufficient to achieve the purposes of\u200a\u201d  \n\u00a7 254.  Taken together, these provisions demonstrate \nthat the FCC is not in the dark as to the amount of fund-\ning it should seek each quarter.  Instead, \u00a7 254 sets out \nthe FCC\u2019s obligations with respect to administration of \nthe USF and the FCC, in turn, calculates what funds are \nnecessary to satisfy its obligations. \nUltimately, \u00a7 254 reflects Congress\u2019s understanding \nthat telecommunications services are constantly evolv-\ning.6  That understanding also drove Congress to im-\n \n6  See, e.g., \u00a7 254(c)(1) (providing that \u201c[u]niversal service is an \nevolving level of telecommunications services that the Commission \n \n\n137a \n \nplement a unique revenue raising mechanism for the \nUSF.  That the mechanism is unique is not in itself a \nnondelegation violation\u2014especially where Congress has \nplaced identifiable limits on what USF distributions can \nfund.  See, e.g., \u00a7 254(b)-(e).  Congress failed to place \nthese limitations on the President in Panama Refining \n\u2014and that led the Supreme Court to hold that a non-\ndelegation violation occurred.  But Congress did not \nmake that same mistake with \u00a7 254, instead, ensuring \nthat the statute is replete with intelligible principles to \nguide the FCC.  Because Congress provided the FCC \nwith numerous intelligible principles for its administra-\ntion of the USF and those principles sufficiently limit \nthe FCC\u2019s revenue-raising activity, we hold that \u00a7 254 \ndoes not violate the nondelegation doctrine. \nC.  Private Nondelegation \nThe private nondelegation doctrine prevents \u201cgov-\nernments from delegating too much power to private \npersons and entities.\u201d  Boerschig, 872 F.3d at 707.  \n\u201cAlthough this so-called private nondelegation doctrine \nhas been largely dormant\u201d for nearly a century, \u201cits con-\ntinuing force is generally accepted.\u201d  Id.; see also Nat\u2019l \nHorsemen\u2019s Benevolent & Protective Ass\u2019n v. Black, 53 \nF.4th 869, 880-82 (5th Cir. 2022) (discussing the evolu-\ntion of the private nondelegation doctrine).  Function-\nally, the doctrine prevents agencies from giving private \nparties the \u201cunrestrained ability to decide whether an-\nother citizen\u2019s property rights can be restricted\u201d be-\n \nshall establish periodically under this section, taking into account \nadvances in telecommunications and information technologies and \nservices\u201d). \n\n138a \n \ncause \u201cany resulting deprivation happens without \u2018pro-\ncess of law.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Boerschig, 872 F.3d at 708. \nTo be clear, agencies \u201cmay subdelegate to private en-\ntities so long as the entities \u2018function subordinately to\u2019 \nthe federal agency and the federal agency \u2018has authority \nand surveillance over [their] activities.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Rettig, 987 \nF.3d at 532 (quoting Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v. \nAdkins, 310 U.S. 381, 399 (1940)).  Ultimately, a statute \ndoes not violate the private nondelegation doctrine if it \n\u201c\u200a\u2018imposes a standard to guide\u2019 the private party and (2) \nprovides \u2018review of that determination that prevents the \n[private party] from having the final say.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. (altera-\ntion in original) (quoting Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 \nU.S. 238, 310-311 (1936)). \nOur decision in National Horsemen provides a timely \ncomparator to the instant case.  53 F.4th 869 (5th Cir. \n2022).  There, multiple organizations sued the Federal \nTrade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d), alleging that the Horserac-\ning Integrity and Safety Act\u2019s (\u201cHISA\u201d) regulatory \nscheme violated the private nondelegation doctrine by \ngiving government power to the Horseracing Integrity \nand Safety Authority (the \u201cAuthority\u201d) without adequate \nagency supervision.  Id.  On appeal, we held that the \nFTC\u2019s relationship with the Authority violated the pri-\nvate nondelegation doctrine. \nWe first noted that, under HISA, the Authority had \n\u201csweeping rulemaking power,\u201d with the ability to estab-\nlish, enforce, and punish all entities involved in the \nhorseracing industry.  Id. at 882.  We also observed \nthat \u201cHISA\u2019s generous grant of authority to the Author-\nity to craft entire industry programs strongly suggests \nit is the Authority, not the FTC, that is in the saddle.\u201d  \nId. at 883 (internal quotations omitted).  Finally, we \n\n139a \n \nhighlighted that the FTC had no authority to conduct \nindependent review of the Authority\u2019s policy choices and \ndid not possess final say on what rules the Authority \npromulgated.  See id. at 884.  Instead, the FTC could \nonly \u201crecommend changes to the Authority\u2019s rules (and \nthen, only to the extent that the rules are inconsistent \nwith HISA).\u201d  Id. at 888.  After considering the lack \nof oversight and control the FTC exercised over the Au-\nthority, we ruled against the FTC and held its redelega-\ntion of Congressional power unconstitutional. \nIn this case, Petitioners argue that the FCC violated \nthe private nondelegation doctrine when it redelegated \nits authority over the USF to USAC, a private entity.  \nThey aver that the FCC does not oversee USAC in its \nperformance of its duties.  For example, they highlight \nthat the FCC rarely exercises its power to alter USAC\u2019s \nproposed contribution factor under \u00a7 54.709(a)(3).  They \nassert that one reason that the FCC does not exercise \nthis authority is because the statute affords the agency \njust fourteen days to review and alter any USAC deter-\nminations before they become binding on the telecom-\nmunications carriers.  To Petitioners, such a small win-\ndow for review renders the FCC\u2019s oversight over USAC \nmeaningless.  They suggest that the FCC is a rubber \nstamp for USAC\u2019s proposals and that USAC effectively \nadministers the USF.  We disagree. \nHere, the FCC has not violated the private nondele-\ngation doctrine because it wholly subordinates USAC.  \nFirst, federal statutory law expressly subordinates \nUSAC to the FCC.  See 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.702(b) (provid-\ning that USAC \u201cmay not make policy, interpret unclear \nprovisions of the statute or rules, or interpret the intent \nof Congress\u201d).  Second, unlike in National Horsemen, \n\n140a \n \nUSAC does not enjoy the same type of sweeping rule-\nmaking power\u2014instead it makes a series of proposals to \nthe FCC based off expert analysis, which are not bind-\ning on carriers until the FCC approves them.  See 47 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 54.709(a).  Third, the FCC permits telecom-\nmunications carriers to challenge USAC proposals di-\nrectly to the agency and often grants relief to those chal-\nlenges.7  Fourth, the FCC dictates how USAC calcu-\nlates the USF contribution factor and subsequently re-\nviews the calculation method after USAC makes a pro-\nposal.  See 47 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 54.709(a)(2)-(3); 54.711(a). \nUltimately, the FCC only uses USAC\u2019s proposals af-\nter independent consideration of the collected data and \nother relevant information.  We have expressly upheld \nthese types of arrangements.  See Rettig, 987 F.3d at \n531 (noting that agencies are permitted to \u201creasonably \ncondition\u201d their actions \u201con an outside party\u2019s determi-\nnation of some issue\u201d).  Because the FCC properly sub-\nordinates USAC, it has not violated the private nondele-\ngation doctrine. \nIV.

The proposed circularity discount \nfactor is calculated in a spreadsheet program, which means that \ninternal calculations are made with more than 15 decimal places. \n11 See 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.709(a)(3). \n\n147a \n \nuse the contribution factor to calculate universal service \ncontributions for the first quarter of 2022.  USAC will \nreduce each provider\u2019s contribution obligation by a cir-\ncularity discount approximating the provider\u2019s contribu-\ntions in the upcoming quarter.12  USAC includes con-\ntribution obligations less the circularity discount in in-\nvoices sent to contributors.  Contribution payments \nare due on the dates shown on the invoice.  Contribu-\ntors will pay interest for each day for which the pay-\nments are late.  Contributors failing to pay contribu-\ntions in a timely fashion may be subject to the enforce-\nment provisions of the Communications Act of 1934, as \namended, and any other applicable law.  In addition, \ncontributors may be billed by USAC for reasonable \ncosts of collecting overdue contributions.13 \nWe also emphasize that carriers may not mark up \nfederal universal service line-item amounts above the \ncontribution factor.14  Thus, carriers may not, during \nthe first quarter of 2022, recover through a federal uni-\nversal service line item an amount that exceeds 25.2 per-\ncent of the interstate telecommunications charges on a \ncustomer\u2019s bill. \nIn addition, under the limited international revenues \nexception (LIRE) in section 54.706(c) of the Commis-\nsion\u2019s rules, a contributor to the universal service fund \nwhose projected collected interstate end-user telecom-\nmunications revenues comprise less than 12 percent of \nits combined projected collected interstate and interna-\n \n12 USAC will calculate each individual contributor\u2019s contribution \nin the following manner:  (1-Circulatory Factor) * (Contribution \nFactor*Revenue) \n13 See 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.713. \n14 See 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.712. \n\n148a \n \ntional end-user telecommunications revenues shall con-\ntribute based only on projected collected interstate end-\nuser telecommunications revenues, net of projected con-\ntributions.15  The rule is intended to exclude from the \ncontribution base the international end-user telecom-\nmunications revenues of any entity whose annual contri-\nbution, based on the provider\u2019s interstate and interna-\ntional end-user telecommunications revenues, would ex-\nceed the amount of its interstate end-user revenues.16  \nThe proposed contribution factor exceeds 12 percent, \nwhich we recognize could result in a contributor being \nrequired to contribute to the universal service fund an \namount that exceeds its interstate end-user telecommu-\nnications revenue.  Should a contributor face this situ-\nation, the contributor may petition the Commission for \nwaiver of the LIRE threshold.17 \n \n15 See 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.706. \n16 See Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service, Sixteenth \nOrder on Reconsideration, CC Docket No. 96-45, Eighth Report \nand Order, CC Docket No. 96-45, Sixth Report and Order, Docket \nNo. 96-262, 15 FCC Rcd 1679, 1687-1692, paras. 17-29 (1999) (Fifth \nCircuit Remand Order). \n17 Generally, the Commission\u2019s rules may be waived for good \ncause shown.  47 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.3.  The Commission may exercise its \ndiscretion to waive a rule where the particular facts make strict \ncompliance inconsistent with the public interest.  Northeast Cel-\nlular Telephone Co. v.

Absent release of this Public Notice, the six-digit \ncontribution factor announced on March 7, 2003 would be deemed \napproved by the Commission on March 21, 2003.

USAC uses revenue data provided \nby carriers on the FCC Form 499-A to perform annual \ntrue-ups of actual revenue to the quarterly projected \nrevenue data submitted by carriers on FCC Form 499-\nQ during the prior calendar year. 12   As necessary, \nUSAC will refund or collect from carriers any over-pay-\nments or underpayments.  As mandated by the Com-\nmission, if the combined quarterly revenues reported by \na carrier on its Forms 499-Q are greater than those re-\nported on its annual revenue report on Form 499-A, then \na refund will be provided to the carrier based on an av-\nerage of the two lowest contribution factors for the \nyear.13  If the combined quarterly revenues reported \nby a carrier are less than those reported on its annual \nrevenue report on Form 499-A, then USAC will collect \n \n11 The FCC Form 499-Q includes a box for each of the quarterly \nfiling submissions.  Carriers check the appropriate box to indicate \nthe quarter for which revenue information is being reported.  \nData is due to USAC approximately one month before the filing is \ndue to the FCC. \n12 In addition, carriers may file a revised Form 499-Q within 45 \ndays of the original filing due date for the current quarter.

In addition \nto the members of the Joint Board required un-\nder section 410(c) of this title, one member of such \nJoint Board shall be a State-appointed utility con-\nsumer advocate nominated by a national organization \nof State utility consumer advocates.  The Joint \nBoard shall, after notice and opportunity for public \ncomment, make its recommendations to the Commis-\nsion 9 months after February 8, 1996. \n(2) Commission action \n \nThe Commission shall initiate a single proceeding \nto implement the recommendations from the Joint \nBoard required by paragraph (1) and shall complete \nsuch proceeding within 15 months after February 8, \n1996.  The rules established by such proceeding \nshall include a definition of the services that are sup-\nported by Federal universal service support mecha-\n\n163a \n \nnisms and a specific timetable for implementation.  \nThereafter, the Commission shall complete any pro-\nceeding to implement subsequent recommendations \nfrom any Joint Board on universal service within one \nyear after receiving such recommendations. \n(b) \nUniversal service principles \nThe Joint Board and the Commission shall base poli-\ncies for the preservation and advancement of universal \nservice on the following principles: \n(1) Quality and rates \n \nQuality services should be available at just, rea-\nsonable, and affordable rates. \n(2) Access to advanced services \n \nAccess to advanced telecommunications and infor-\nmation services should be provided in all regions of \nthe Nation. \n(3) Access in rural and high cost areas \n \nConsumers in all regions of the Nation, including \nlow-income consumers and those in rural, insular, \nand high cost areas, should have access to telecom-\nmunications and information services, including \ninterexchange services and advanced telecommuni-\ncations and information services, that are reasonably \ncomparable to those services provided in urban areas \nand that are available at rates that are reasonably \ncomparable to rates charged for similar services in \nurban areas. \n(4) Equitable and nondiscriminatory contributions \n \nAll providers of telecommunications services \nshould make an equitable and nondiscriminatory con-\n\n164a \n \ntribution to the preservation and advancement of uni-\nversal service. \n(5) Specific and predictable support mechanisms \n \nThere should be specific, predictable and suffi-\ncient Federal and State mechanisms to preserve and \nadvance universal service. \n(6) Access to advanced telecommunications services \nfor schools, health care, and libraries \n \nElementary and secondary schools and class-\nrooms, health care providers, and libraries should \nhave access to advanced telecommunications services \nas described in subsection (h). \n(7) Additional principles \n \nSuch other principles as the Joint Board and the \nCommission determine are necessary and appropri-\nate for the protection of the public interest, conven-\nience, and necessity and are consistent with this \nchapter. \n(c) \nDefinition \n(1) In general \n \nUniversal service is an evolving level of telecom-\nmunications services that the Commission shall es-\ntablish periodically under this section, taking into ac-\ncount advances in telecommunications and informa-\ntion technologies and services.  The Joint Board in \nrecommending, and the Commission in establishing, \nthe definition of the services that are supported by \nFederal universal service support mechanisms shall \nconsider the extent to which such telecommunica-\ntions services\u2014 \n\n165a \n \n \n(A) \nare essential to education, public health, \nor public safety; \n \n(B) \nhave, through the operation of market \nchoices by customers, been subscribed to by a sub-\nstantial majority of residential customers; \n \n(C) \nare being deployed in public telecommu-\nnications networks by telecommunications carri-\ners; and \n \n(D) \nare consistent with the public interest, \nconvenience, and necessity. \n(2) Alterations and modifications \n \nThe Joint Board may, from time to time, recom-\nmend to the Commission modifications in the defini-\ntion of the services that are supported by Federal \nuniversal service support mechanisms. \n(3) Special services \n \nIn addition to the services included in the defini-\ntion of universal service under paragraph (1), the \nCommission may designate additional services for \nsuch support mechanisms for schools, libraries, and \nhealth care providers for the purposes of subsection \n(h). \n(d) \nTelecommunications carrier contribution \nEvery telecommunications carrier that provides in-\nterstate telecommunications services shall contribute, \non an equitable and nondiscriminatory basis, to the spe-\ncific, predictable, and sufficient mechanisms established \nby the Commission to preserve and advance universal \nservice.  The Commission may exempt a carrier or \nclass of carriers from this requirement if the carrier\u2019s \n\n166a \n \ntelecommunications activities are limited to such an ex-\ntent that the level of such carrier\u2019s contribution to the \npreservation and advancement of universal service \nwould be de minimis.  Any other provider of interstate \ntelecommunications may be required to contribute to \nthe preservation and advancement of universal service \nif the public interest so requires. \n(e) \nUniversal service support \nAfter the date on which Commission regulations im-\nplementing this section take effect, only an eligible tele-\ncommunications carrier designated under section 214(e) \nof this title shall be eligible to receive specific Federal uni-\nversal service support.  A carrier that receives such sup-\nport shall use that support only for the provision, mainte-\nnance, and upgrading of facilities and services for which \nthe support is intended.  Any such support should be \nexplicit and sufficient to achieve the purposes of this sec-\ntion. \n(f\u200a) \nState authority \nA State may adopt regulations not inconsistent with \nthe Commission\u2019s rules to preserve and advance univer-\nsal service.  Every telecommunications carrier that \nprovides intrastate telecommunications services shall \ncontribute, on an equitable and nondiscriminatory basis, \nin a manner determined by the State to the preservation \nand advancement of universal service in that State.  A \nState may adopt regulations to provide for additional \ndefinitions and standards to preserve and advance uni-\nversal service within that State only to the extent that \nsuch regulations adopt additional specific, predictable, \nand sufficient mechanisms to support such definitions or \n\n167a \n \nstandards that do not rely on or burden Federal univer-\nsal service support mechanisms. \n(g) \nInterexchange and interstate services \nWithin 6 months after February 8, 1996, the Commis-\nsion shall adopt rules to require that the rates charged \nby providers of interexchange telecommunications ser-\nvices to subscribers in rural and high cost areas shall be \nno higher than the rates charged by each such provider \nto its subscribers in urban areas.  Such rules shall also \nrequire that a provider of interstate interexchange tele-\ncommunications services shall provide such services to \nits subscribers in each State at rates no higher than the \nrates charged to its subscribers in any other State. \n(h) Telecommunications services for certain providers \n(1) In general \n \n(A) \nHealth care providers for rural areas \n \nA telecommunications carrier shall, upon re-\nceiving a bona fide request, provide telecommuni-\ncations services which are necessary for the pro-\nvision of health care services in a State, including \ninstruction relating to such services, to any public \nor nonprofit health care provider that serves per-\nsons who reside in rural areas in that State at \nrates that are reasonably comparable to rates \ncharged for similar services in urban areas in that \nState.  A telecommunications carrier providing \nservice under this paragraph shall be entitled to \nhave an amount equal to the difference, if any, be-\ntween the rates for services provided to health \ncare providers for rural areas in a State and the \nrates for similar services provided to other cus-\ntomers in comparable rural areas in that State \n\n168a \n \ntreated as a service obligation as a part of its obli-\ngation to participate in the mechanisms to pre-\nserve and advance universal service. \n \n(B) \nEducational providers and libraries \n \nAll telecommunications carriers serving a geo-\ngraphic area shall, upon a bona fide request for \nany of its services that are within the definition of \nuniversal service under subsection (c)(3), provide \nsuch services to elementary schools, secondary \nschools, and libraries for educational purposes at \nrates less than the amounts charged for similar \nservices to other parties.  The discount shall be \nan amount that the Commission, with respect to \ninterstate services, and the States, with respect to \nintrastate services, determine is appropriate and \nnecessary to ensure affordable access to and use \nof such services by such entities.  A telecommu-\nnications carrier providing service under this par-\nagraph shall\u2014 \n \n(i) \nhave an amount equal to the amount of \nthe discount treated as an offset to its obliga-\ntion to contribute to the mechanisms to pre-\nserve and advance universal service, or \n \n(ii) notwithstanding the provisions of sub-\nsection (e) of this section, receive reimburse-\nment utilizing the support mechanisms to pre-\nserve and advance universal service. \n(2) Advanced services \n \nThe Commission shall establish competitively \nneutral rules\u2014 \n\n169a \n \n \n(A) \nto enhance, to the extent technically fea-\nsible and economically reasonable, access to ad-\nvanced telecommunications and information ser-\nvices for all public and nonprofit elementary and \nsecondary school classrooms, health care provid-\ners, and libraries; and \n \n(B) \nto define the circumstances under which \na telecommunications carrier may be required to \nconnect its network to such public institutional tel-\necommunications users. \n(3) Terms and conditions \n \nTelecommunications services and network capac-\nity provided to a public institutional telecommunica-\ntions user under this subsection may not be sold, re-\nsold, or otherwise transferred by such user in consid-\neration for money or any other thing of value. \n(4) Eligibility of users \n \nNo entity listed in this subsection shall be entitled \nto preferential rates or treatment as required by this \nsubsection, if such entity operates as a for-profit \nbusiness, is a school described in paragraph (7)(A) \nwith an endowment of more than $50,000,000, or is a \nlibrary or library consortium not eligible for assis-\ntance from a State library administrative agency un-\nder the Library Services and Technology Act [20 \nU.S.C. 9121 et seq.]. \n \n \n\n170a \n \n(5) Requirements for certain schools with computers \nhaving Internet access \n \n(A) \nInternet safety \n \n \n(i) \nIn general \n \nExcept as provided in clause (ii), an elemen-\ntary or secondary school having computers \nwith Internet access may not receive services \nat discount rates under paragraph (1)(B) unless \nthe school, school board, local educational \nagency, or other authority with responsibility \nfor administration of the school\u2014 \n \n(I) \nsubmits to the Commission the cer-\ntifications described in subparagraphs (B) \nand (C); \n \n(II) submits to the Commission a certi-\nfication that an Internet safety policy has \nbeen adopted and implemented for the \nschool under subsection (l); and \n \n(III) ensures the use of such computers \nin accordance with the certifications. \n \n \n(ii) Applicability \n \nThe prohibition in clause (i) shall not apply \nwith respect to a school that receives services \nat discount rates under paragraph (1)(B) only \nfor purposes other than the provision of Inter-\nnet access, Internet service, or internal connec-\ntions. \n \n \n(iii) Public notice; hearing \n \nAn elementary or secondary school de-\nscribed in clause (i), or the school board, local \n\n171a \n \neducational agency, or other authority with re-\nsponsibility for administration of the school, \nshall provide reasonable public notice and hold \nat least one public hearing or meeting to ad-\ndress the proposed Internet safety policy.  In \nthe case of an elementary or secondary school \nother than an elementary school or a secondary \nschool as defined in section 7801 of title 20, the \nnotice and hearing required by this clause may \nbe limited to those members of the public with \na relationship to the school. \n \n(B) \nCertification with respect to minors \n \nA certification under this subparagraph is a \ncertification that the school, school board, local ed-\nucational agency, or other authority with respon-\nsibility for administration of the school\u2014 \n \n(i) \nis enforcing a policy of Internet safety \nfor minors that includes monitoring the online \nactivities of minors and the operation of a tech-\nnology protection measure with respect to any \nof its computers with Internet access that pro-\ntects against access through such computers to \nvisual depictions that are\u2014 \n \n \n \n \n(I) \nobscene;

The nondelegation doctrine is a key area of interest for the current Court, and the respondent's framing of the argument is critical. The Design EIG is lower (0.3) because, while reading the main party's brief is a crucial and effective strategy, it is a foundational one.

The Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s March 24, 2023, vacated panel opinion \n(Pet.App.125a) is reported at 63 F.4th 441. \nJURISDICTION \nThis Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1254(1). The en banc Fifth Circuit entered its \njudgment on July 24, 2024. \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \nRespondents in this case (\u201cthe Challengers\u201d) have \nlong contended that the taxing system used to fund \nthe \nUniversal \nService \nFund \n(\u201cUSF\u201d) \nis \nunconstitutional under nondelegation principles. \nIndeed, the Challengers include all petitioners in two \nother cases currently pending before this Court \nraising nondelegation challenges to the USF. See \nConsumers\u2019 Research v. FCC, Nos. 23-456 & 23-743 \n(certiorari denied June 10, 2024; rehearing sought \nJune 18, 2024). Those cases arose out of the Sixth and \nEleventh Circuits, respectively. \nThe en banc Fifth Circuit\u2019s scholarly decision \nbelow adopted the Challengers\u2019 arguments and held \nthe USF funding mechanism violates Article I of the \nU.S. Constitution. As the en banc Fifth Circuit \nexplained, \u201cthere is no record of any government \nprogram like [the] USF in all the U.S. Reports.\u201d \nPet.App.67a. Rather than pay for a multi-billion-\ndollar social welfare program with an appropriation \nfrom \nfederal \nrevenues, \nCongress \nrequires \ntelecommunications carriers to contribute to the USF, \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(d), with carriers passing along a \nportion of that cost to consumers via line-item charges \nin their monthly phone bills, 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.712(a). \nThe collected funds are then redistributed by the \nprivate Universal Service Administrative Company \n(\u201cUSAC\u201d) to entities and projects that ostensibly will \nexpand telecommunications services. 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(b), (e). \n\n3 \n \nBut Congress imposed no formula, ceiling, or other \nmeaningful restrictions on how much money can be \nraised for the USF. To be sure, Congress provided a \nlist of universal service \u201cprinciples.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(b). But they are so amorphous and non-binding \nthat courts\u2014adopting the FCC\u2019s own language\u2014have \nlong labeled them \u201caspirational only,\u201d Tex. Off. of Pub. \nUtil. Couns. v. FCC, 265 F.3d 313, 321 (5th Cir. 2001), \nmeaning Congress \u201csuppl[ied] no principle at all,\u201d \nPet.App.27a. \nIn \naddition, \nCongress \nexpressly \nauthorized the FCC to redefine \u201cuniversal service\u201d and \n\u201cuniversal service principles\u201d as often as it wishes, \ngiving the agency even broader authority to raise \nbillions of dollars in taxes for a program designed to \nbenefit the country more broadly. See 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(b)(7), (c)(1). \nThe FCC then off-loaded authority over the USF to \nUSAC, a private entity of self-described industry \ninsiders with an incentive to push USF charges \nincreasingly higher. Each quarter, USAC exercises its \ndiscretion in determining the desired budget for the \nUSF, which includes the cost of funding USAC itself. \nThe FCC then ministerially converts that figure into \na contribution factor that will apply to certain \ntelecommunications revenues, and that tax rate is \nthen passively \u201cdeemed approved\u201d by the FCC 14 days \nlater, without the FCC ever taking any affirmative \naction or even issuing an approval order. 47 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 54.709(a)(3). There is no evidence the FCC itself \never actually reviews USAC\u2019s work or agrees with \nUSAC\u2019s discretionary decisions about how much \n\n4 \n \nmoney to raise, which is far from a ministerial \nundertaking. \nThis entire process happens only days before the \nnew quarter begins, giving the FCC no real option but \nto accept whatever numbers USAC demands. USAC \nthen collects the forced contributions and chooses how \nto disburse the funds. In essence, a private company \nis taxing Americans in amounts that total billions of \ndollars every year, under penalty of law, without true \ngovernmental accountability. \nThe en banc Fifth Circuit correctly held the USF\u2019s \nrevenue raising is unconstitutional under Article I of \nthe U.S. Constitution. See Pet.App.64a\u201381a. The \ncourt concluded there are \u201cgrave concerns about \n\u00a7 254\u2019s constitutionality under the Supreme Court\u2019s \nnondelegation precedents,\u201d as Congress handed over \nits core legislative taxing power to an agency with \nnothing \nmore \nthan \n\u201c\u2018aspirational\u2019\u201d \nlimits. \nPet.App.28a\u201329a, 42a. The Fifth Circuit also had \n\u201cserious trouble squaring FCC\u2019s subdelegation [to \nUSAC] with Article I, \u00a7 1 of the Constitution.\u201d \nPet.App.54a\u201355a. \nRather than hold independently unconstitutional \nCongress\u2019s delegation to the FCC and the FCC\u2019s \ndelegation to USAC, the Court concluded that the \ncombination \nwas \nunconstitutional. \n\u201c[T]he \nunprecedented nature of the delegation\u201d of broad \ntaxing power from Congress to the FCC, \u201ccombined \nwith other factors\u201d like the FCC\u2019s subsequent \nredelegation to USAC, was more than \u201cenough to hold \n[the USF] unlawful.\u201d Pet.App.42a. \n\n5 \n \nThe dual layers of delegation\u2014from Congress to \nthe FCC, then from the FCC to USAC\u2014\u201cobscure lines \nof accountability the Framers intended to be clear\u201d \nand \u201crender the promise of recourse to the judiciary \nillusory because they give reviewing courts no \nstandard against which to measure the compatibility \nof executive action with the prescriptions of the \npeople\u2019s elected representatives.\u201d Pet.App.75a. \nThe \nFifth \nCircuit \nconcluded: \n\u201cAmerican \ntelecommunications consumers are subject to a \nmultibillion-dollar tax nobody voted for. The size of \nthat tax is de facto determined by a trade group \nstaffed by industry insiders with no semblance of \naccountability to the public. And the trade group in \nturn relies on projections made by its private, for-\nprofit constituent companies, all of which stand to \nprofit \nfrom \nevery \nsingle \ntax \nincrease. \nThis \ncombination of delegations, subdelegations, and \nobfuscations of the USF Tax mechanism offends \nArticle I, \u00a7 1 of the Constitution.\u201d Pet.App.81a. \nConcurring, several judges would have gone \nfurther, explaining that \u201cCongress\u2019s delegation of \nlegislative power to the FCC and the FCC\u2019s delegation \nof the taxing power to a private entity each \nindividually contravene the separation of powers \nprinciple \nthat \nundergirds \nour \nConstitutional \nRepublic.\u201d Pet.App.82a (Elrod, J., joined by Ho & \nEnglehardt, JJ., concurring) (emphasis added). \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision was unsurprising. \nScholars had long flagged these serious constitutional \nflaws with the USF. \u201cUnlike the thousands of \n\n6 \n \nresponsibilities carried out by governmental agencies \non behalf of Congress, this delegation is unique \nbecause of the unfettered power given to the FCC in \ndefining the scope of universal service, and because \nCongress delegated the power to levy a tax to pay for \nthe service with no limits, knowing that the end user, \nthe American public, would ultimately be saddled \nwith the burden.\u201d Barbara A. Cherry & Donald D. \nNystrom, \nUniversal \nService \nContributions: \nAn \nUnconstitutional Delegation of Taxing Power, 2000 L. \nRev. Mich. St. U. Det. C.L. 107, 110. \nSimilarly, former FCC Commissioner Harold \nFurchtgott-Roth has written that the USF charges are \na \u201chidden tax\u201d where \u201c[t]he FCC, by its own logic, [has] \nas much authority to spend $2.25 trillion as it [has] to \nspend $2.25 billion.\u201d Harold W. Furchtgott-Roth, A \nTough Act to Follow? at 62, 72 (2006). \nThe Challengers consented to the government\u2019s \nrequest to stay the Fifth Circuit\u2019s mandate, on \ncondition that the government file its petition for a \nwrit of certiorari by September 30, 2024. The Fifth \nCircuit granted the government\u2019s request. See Order, \nConsumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, No. 22-60008 (5th Cir. Aug. \n26, 2024), ECF No. 349-2. \nDISCUSSION \nAs noted above, the Challengers filed petitions for \nwrits of certiorari from decisions by the Sixth and \nEleventh Circuits, which rejected the Challengers\u2019 \nnondelegation claims. See Consumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, \nNos. 23-456 & 23-743. The Challengers have sought \n\n7 \n \nrehearing of this Court\u2019s June 2024 denial of those \npetitions. Id. Those rehearing petitions remain \npending. \nGiven their own pending requests for this Court\u2019s \nreview of those adverse rulings, the Challengers agree \nthe constitutionality of the USF funding mechanism \nwarrants this Court\u2019s review. There is also now a \ncircuit split on whether that funding mechanism \nviolates nondelegation principles. \nTime is of the essence because the government \ncontinues to collect funds for the USF despite the \nFifth Circuit\u2019s holding below, as the Fifth Circuit \nagreed to stay its mandate on condition that the \ngovernment file its petition for a writ of certiorari by \nSeptember 30, 2024. See Order, Consumers\u2019 Rsch., No. \n22-60008 (5th Cir. Aug. 26, 2024). \nGiven the time sensitivity, the Court should grant \nthe petitions for rehearing and certiorari in Nos. 23-\n456 and 23-743, which are already fully briefed, and \nthus merits briefing can begin immediately. The \nCourt could then either consolidate all three cases, or \nhold this case pending a decision in Nos. 23-456 and \n23-743. \nThe Court should realign the parties for any \nconsolidated proceedings so the Challengers are \ntreated as petitioners, given that they first sought this \nCourt\u2019s review on these issues and have been \npetitioners in all lower-court proceedings. The Court \nhas previously realigned the parties in cases raising \nthe same issue, consistent with the parties\u2019 status in \n\n8 \n \nthe earlier-filed case. See, e.g., Axon Enter., Inc. v. \nFTC, No. 21-86 & SEC v. Cochran, No. 21-1239 \n(realigned parties so the Government was treated as \nrespondent in both cases); AMG Capital Mgmt., LLC \nv. FTC, No. 19-508 & FTC v. Credit Bureau Ctr., LLC, \nNo. 19-825 (similar). The Court has also previously \ngranted rehearing and then consolidated several \npending cases for merits briefing and argument. See, \ne.g., Al Odah v. United States, No. 06-1196 & \nBoumediene v. Bush, No. 06-1195. \n \n \n\n9 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe petitions for rehearing and for writs of \ncertiorari in Nos. 23-456 and 23-743 should be \ngranted. If the Court grants this case (No. 24-354), \ntoo, it should either hold it pending a decision in Nos. \n23-456 and 23-743, or consolidate the three cases and \nrealign the parties here so the Challengers are treated \nas petitioners. \nROBERT HENNEKE \nCHANCE WELDON \nTEXAS PUBLIC POLICY \nFOUNDATION \n901 Congress Avenue \nAustin, TX 78701 \n(512) 472-2700 \nrhenneke@texaspolicy.com \n \nR.

The Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s March 24, 2023, vacated panel opinion \n(Pet.App.125a) is reported at 63 F.4th 441. \nJURISDICTION \nThis Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1254(1). The en banc Fifth Circuit entered its \njudgment on July 24, 2024. \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \nRespondents in this case (\u201cthe Challengers\u201d) have \nlong contended that the taxing system used to fund \nthe \nUniversal \nService \nFund \n(\u201cUSF\u201d) \nis \nunconstitutional under nondelegation principles. \nIndeed, the Challengers include all petitioners in two \nother cases currently pending before this Court \nraising nondelegation challenges to the USF. See \nConsumers\u2019 Research v. FCC, Nos. 23-456 & 23-743 \n(certiorari denied June 10, 2024; rehearing sought \nJune 18, 2024). Those cases arose out of the Sixth and \nEleventh Circuits, respectively. \nThe en banc Fifth Circuit\u2019s scholarly decision \nbelow adopted the Challengers\u2019 arguments and held \nthe USF funding mechanism violates Article I of the \nU.S. Constitution. As the en banc Fifth Circuit \nexplained, \u201cthere is no record of any government \nprogram like [the] USF in all the U.S. Reports.\u201d \nPet.App.67a. Rather than pay for a multi-billion-\ndollar social welfare program with an appropriation \nfrom \nfederal \nrevenues, \nCongress \nrequires \ntelecommunications carriers to contribute to the USF, \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(d), with carriers passing along a \nportion of that cost to consumers via line-item charges \nin their monthly phone bills, 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.712(a). \nThe collected funds are then redistributed by the \nprivate Universal Service Administrative Company \n(\u201cUSAC\u201d) to entities and projects that ostensibly will \nexpand telecommunications services. 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(b), (e). \n\n3 \n \nBut Congress imposed no formula, ceiling, or other \nmeaningful restrictions on how much money can be \nraised for the USF. To be sure, Congress provided a \nlist of universal service \u201cprinciples.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(b). But they are so amorphous and non-binding \nthat courts\u2014adopting the FCC\u2019s own language\u2014have \nlong labeled them \u201caspirational only,\u201d Tex. Off. of Pub. \nUtil. Couns. v. FCC, 265 F.3d 313, 321 (5th Cir. 2001), \nmeaning Congress \u201csuppl[ied] no principle at all,\u201d \nPet.App.27a. \nIn \naddition, \nCongress \nexpressly \nauthorized the FCC to redefine \u201cuniversal service\u201d and \n\u201cuniversal service principles\u201d as often as it wishes, \ngiving the agency even broader authority to raise \nbillions of dollars in taxes for a program designed to \nbenefit the country more broadly. See 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(b)(7), (c)(1). \nThe FCC then off-loaded authority over the USF to \nUSAC, a private entity of self-described industry \ninsiders with an incentive to push USF charges \nincreasingly higher. Each quarter, USAC exercises its \ndiscretion in determining the desired budget for the \nUSF, which includes the cost of funding USAC itself. \nThe FCC then ministerially converts that figure into \na contribution factor that will apply to certain \ntelecommunications revenues, and that tax rate is \nthen passively \u201cdeemed approved\u201d by the FCC 14 days \nlater, without the FCC ever taking any affirmative \naction or even issuing an approval order. 47 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 54.709(a)(3). There is no evidence the FCC itself \never actually reviews USAC\u2019s work or agrees with \nUSAC\u2019s discretionary decisions about how much \n\n4 \n \nmoney to raise, which is far from a ministerial \nundertaking. \nThis entire process happens only days before the \nnew quarter begins, giving the FCC no real option but \nto accept whatever numbers USAC demands. USAC \nthen collects the forced contributions and chooses how \nto disburse the funds. In essence, a private company \nis taxing Americans in amounts that total billions of \ndollars every year, under penalty of law, without true \ngovernmental accountability. \nThe en banc Fifth Circuit correctly held the USF\u2019s \nrevenue raising is unconstitutional under Article I of \nthe U.S. Constitution. See Pet.App.64a\u201381a. The \ncourt concluded there are \u201cgrave concerns about \n\u00a7 254\u2019s constitutionality under the Supreme Court\u2019s \nnondelegation precedents,\u201d as Congress handed over \nits core legislative taxing power to an agency with \nnothing \nmore \nthan \n\u201c\u2018aspirational\u2019\u201d \nlimits. \nPet.App.28a\u201329a, 42a. The Fifth Circuit also had \n\u201cserious trouble squaring FCC\u2019s subdelegation [to \nUSAC] with Article I, \u00a7 1 of the Constitution.\u201d \nPet.App.54a\u201355a. \nRather than hold independently unconstitutional \nCongress\u2019s delegation to the FCC and the FCC\u2019s \ndelegation to USAC, the Court concluded that the \ncombination \nwas \nunconstitutional. \n\u201c[T]he \nunprecedented nature of the delegation\u201d of broad \ntaxing power from Congress to the FCC, \u201ccombined \nwith other factors\u201d like the FCC\u2019s subsequent \nredelegation to USAC, was more than \u201cenough to hold \n[the USF] unlawful.\u201d Pet.App.42a. \n\n5 \n \nThe dual layers of delegation\u2014from Congress to \nthe FCC, then from the FCC to USAC\u2014\u201cobscure lines \nof accountability the Framers intended to be clear\u201d \nand \u201crender the promise of recourse to the judiciary \nillusory because they give reviewing courts no \nstandard against which to measure the compatibility \nof executive action with the prescriptions of the \npeople\u2019s elected representatives.\u201d Pet.App.75a. \nThe \nFifth \nCircuit \nconcluded: \n\u201cAmerican \ntelecommunications consumers are subject to a \nmultibillion-dollar tax nobody voted for. The size of \nthat tax is de facto determined by a trade group \nstaffed by industry insiders with no semblance of \naccountability to the public. And the trade group in \nturn relies on projections made by its private, for-\nprofit constituent companies, all of which stand to \nprofit \nfrom \nevery \nsingle \ntax \nincrease. \nThis \ncombination of delegations, subdelegations, and \nobfuscations of the USF Tax mechanism offends \nArticle I, \u00a7 1 of the Constitution.\u201d Pet.App.81a. \nConcurring, several judges would have gone \nfurther, explaining that \u201cCongress\u2019s delegation of \nlegislative power to the FCC and the FCC\u2019s delegation \nof the taxing power to a private entity each \nindividually contravene the separation of powers \nprinciple \nthat \nundergirds \nour \nConstitutional \nRepublic.\u201d Pet.App.82a (Elrod, J., joined by Ho & \nEnglehardt, JJ., concurring) (emphasis added). \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision was unsurprising. \nScholars had long flagged these serious constitutional \nflaws with the USF. \u201cUnlike the thousands of \n\n6 \n \nresponsibilities carried out by governmental agencies \non behalf of Congress, this delegation is unique \nbecause of the unfettered power given to the FCC in \ndefining the scope of universal service, and because \nCongress delegated the power to levy a tax to pay for \nthe service with no limits, knowing that the end user, \nthe American public, would ultimately be saddled \nwith the burden.\u201d Barbara A. Cherry & Donald D. \nNystrom, \nUniversal \nService \nContributions: \nAn \nUnconstitutional Delegation of Taxing Power, 2000 L. \nRev. Mich. St. U. Det. C.L. 107, 110. \nSimilarly, former FCC Commissioner Harold \nFurchtgott-Roth has written that the USF charges are \na \u201chidden tax\u201d where \u201c[t]he FCC, by its own logic, [has] \nas much authority to spend $2.25 trillion as it [has] to \nspend $2.25 billion.\u201d Harold W. Furchtgott-Roth, A \nTough Act to Follow? at 62, 72 (2006). \nThe Challengers consented to the government\u2019s \nrequest to stay the Fifth Circuit\u2019s mandate, on \ncondition that the government file its petition for a \nwrit of certiorari by September 30, 2024. The Fifth \nCircuit granted the government\u2019s request. See Order, \nConsumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, No. 22-60008 (5th Cir. Aug. \n26, 2024), ECF No. 349-2. \nDISCUSSION \nAs noted above, the Challengers filed petitions for \nwrits of certiorari from decisions by the Sixth and \nEleventh Circuits, which rejected the Challengers\u2019 \nnondelegation claims. See Consumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, \nNos. 23-456 & 23-743. The Challengers have sought \n\n7 \n \nrehearing of this Court\u2019s June 2024 denial of those \npetitions. Id. Those rehearing petitions remain \npending. \nGiven their own pending requests for this Court\u2019s \nreview of those adverse rulings, the Challengers agree \nthe constitutionality of the USF funding mechanism \nwarrants this Court\u2019s review. There is also now a \ncircuit split on whether that funding mechanism \nviolates nondelegation principles. \nTime is of the essence because the government \ncontinues to collect funds for the USF despite the \nFifth Circuit\u2019s holding below, as the Fifth Circuit \nagreed to stay its mandate on condition that the \ngovernment file its petition for a writ of certiorari by \nSeptember 30, 2024. See Order, Consumers\u2019 Rsch., No. \n22-60008 (5th Cir. Aug. 26, 2024). \nGiven the time sensitivity, the Court should grant \nthe petitions for rehearing and certiorari in Nos. 23-\n456 and 23-743, which are already fully briefed, and \nthus merits briefing can begin immediately. The \nCourt could then either consolidate all three cases, or \nhold this case pending a decision in Nos. 23-456 and \n23-743. \nThe Court should realign the parties for any \nconsolidated proceedings so the Challengers are \ntreated as petitioners, given that they first sought this \nCourt\u2019s review on these issues and have been \npetitioners in all lower-court proceedings. The Court \nhas previously realigned the parties in cases raising \nthe same issue, consistent with the parties\u2019 status in \n\n8 \n \nthe earlier-filed case. See, e.g., Axon Enter., Inc. v. \nFTC, No. 21-86 & SEC v. Cochran, No. 21-1239 \n(realigned parties so the Government was treated as \nrespondent in both cases); AMG Capital Mgmt., LLC \nv. FTC, No. 19-508 & FTC v. Credit Bureau Ctr., LLC, \nNo. 19-825 (similar). The Court has also previously \ngranted rehearing and then consolidated several \npending cases for merits briefing and argument. See, \ne.g., Al Odah v. United States, No. 06-1196 & \nBoumediene v. Bush, No. 06-1195. \n \n \n\n9 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe petitions for rehearing and for writs of \ncertiorari in Nos. 23-456 and 23-743 should be \ngranted. If the Court grants this case (No. 24-354), \ntoo, it should either hold it pending a decision in Nos. \n23-456 and 23-743, or consolidate the three cases and \nrealign the parties here so the Challengers are treated \nas petitioners. \nROBERT HENNEKE \nCHANCE WELDON \nTEXAS PUBLIC POLICY \nFOUNDATION \n901 Congress Avenue \nAustin, TX 78701 \n(512) 472-2700 \nrhenneke@texaspolicy.com \n \nR.

Understanding these details is absolutely critical for predicting how the justices will analyze the nondelegation and private-delegation issues. Without this, any analysis would be speculative and based only on the case summary. This action will provide the core substance of one side of the case.\n\nDesign EIG is moderate (0.3). The strategy of retrieving the main petition is a fundamental and essential step in SCOTUS case analysis. While it's not a novel or complex strategy, its execution is a hallmark of a sound analytical process. Confirming the value of this foundational step provides some information about building a robust prediction methodology, but it's more of a reinforcement of a known best practice than a new strategic insight.\n\nJoint EIG is high because the immense value for the specific task outweighs the more modest, though still positive, contribution to general strategy.",

On their tell-\ning (Br. 1), Congress has granted the Federal Commu-\nnications Commission (FCC) powers that King George \nIII would have envied:  \u201c[u]nbounded\u201d power to levy taxes, \nsubject at most to \u201cprecatory\u201d standards and \u201c\u200a\u2018aspira-\ntional\u2019\u200a\u201d principles.  Respondents further portray (Br. 2-\n3) the FCC as \u201chand[ing] off this revenue power\u201d to a \nprivate Administrator in defiance of \u201c600 years of  \n\n2 \n \nAnglo-American practice.\u201d  If the Universal Service \nFund really worked that way, the government would \nnot defend its constitutionality.  Congress may not vest \nfederal agencies with an unbounded taxing power.  Nor \ncan Congress or agencies delegate that power to private \nentities.  \nNeither Congress nor the FCC, however, has done \nanything of the sort.  Congress in 47 U.S.C. 254 clearly \ndelineated the policy that the FCC must pursue and the \nlimits of the FCC\u2019s authority, so that courts can police \nthe agency\u2019s compliance with Congress\u2019s commands.  \nAnd the FCC ultimately decides\u2014within the limits and \nunder the standards set by Congress\u2014the amount of \nthe contributions; the Administrator offers non-binding \nrecommendations.  Neither Congress\u2019s conferral of au-\nthority on the FCC, the FCC\u2019s reliance on advice from \nthe Administrator, nor the combination of the two vio-\nlates the Constitution.  \nA. Congress Has Not Delegated Legislative Power To The FCC \n1. Respondents criticize (Br. 30) the leniency of the \nCourt\u2019s longstanding nondelegation approach while \ntellingly declining to ask this Court to overturn its prec-\nedent.  For good reason:  that line of precedent need not \nbe toothless.  Indeed, respondents and the government \nagree on many of the nondelegation ground rules.   \nFor instance, Article I undisputedly distinguishes \nbetween foreign-affairs delegations and domestic ones.  \nArticle II gives the President the \u201clead role in foreign \npolicy.\u201d  American Insurance Ass\u2019n v. Garamendi, 539 \nU.S. 396, 415 (2003) (citations and ellipsis omitted).  This \nCourt has consistently rejected nondelegation challenges \nto statutes empowering the President to exercise sweep-\ning discretion in managing foreign affairs.  See, e.g., \n\n3 \n \nUnited States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299 U.S. \n304, 314-329 (1936); see Resp. Br. 39-41.   \nBy contrast, all agree that the nondelegation rules \nare stricter in the domestic context.  Even then, Con-\ngress \u201cmay commit something to the discretion\u201d of the \nExecutive.  Wayman v. Southard, 10 Wheat. 1, 46 (1825); \nsee Resp. Br. 76.  A \u201cdegree of discretion\u201d \u201cinheres in \nmost executive\u201d action.  Whitman v. American Truck-\ning Ass\u2019ns, 531 U.S. 457, 475 (2001) (citation omitted).  \nAnd legislation often involves \u201cdetails with which the \nnational legislature cannot deal directly.\u201d  Panama Re-\nfining Co. v. Ryan, 293 U.S. 388, 421 (1935); see Gundy \nv. United States, 588 U.S. 128, 157 (2019) (Gorsuch, J., \ndissenting) (Congress \u201cmay authorize another branch \nto \u2018fill up the details.\u2019\u200a\u201d). \nCritically, however, all also agree that Congress may \nnot grant an agency \u201c[u]nbounded\u201d discretion to regu-\nlate private parties.  Resp. Br. 1.  Further, distinguish-\ning lawful conferrals of discretion from unlawful dele-\ngations requires more than just asking \u201cin the abstract \nwhether there is an \u2018intelligible principle.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at 66.  \nCongress must delineate both the \u201cgeneral policy\u201d that \nthe agency must pursue and the \u201cboundaries of th[e] \ndelegated authority.\u201d  American Power & Light Co. v. \nSEC, 329 U.S. 90, 105 (1946); see Gov\u2019t Br. 19; see also, \ne.g., Panama Refining, 293 U.S. at 430 (holding invalid \na provision that \u201cdeclared no policy\u201d).  And \u201cthe degree \nof agency discretion that is acceptable varies according \nto the scope of the power congressionally conferred.\u201d  \nAmerican Trucking, 531 U.S. at 475; see Chamber of \nCommerce Amicus Br. 2-3; see also, e.g., American \nTrucking, 531 U.S. at 474 (Congress may not empower \nan agency \u201cto regulate the entire economy on the basis \n\n4 \n \nof no more precise a standard than\u201d \u201cassuring \u2018fair com-\npetition\u2019\u200a\u201d).   \nFurther, the guidance must be \u201csufficiently definite\u201d \nto permit meaningful judicial review of agency action.  \nGundy, 588 U.S. at 158 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting) (quoting \nYakus v. United States, 321 U.S. 414, 426 (1944)); see, e.g., \nA.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. \n495, 539 (1935) (holding invalid a statute empowering \nthe President to promulgate fair-competition codes \nthat, \u201cin his discretion,\u201d would \u201ctend to effectuate the \n[statute\u2019s] policy\u201d).  And while this case does not pre-\nsent the issue, Article I may impose further limits on \ndelegations of authority to decide \u201cmajor policy ques-\ntions.\u201d  Paul v. United States, 140 S. Ct. 342, 342 (2019) \n(statement of Kavanaugh, J.). \nBut respondents go too far in arguing that \u201cthe level \nof statutory specificity required by the nondelegation \ndoctrine varies\u201d from power to power, so that courts must \napply a \u201c\u200a\u2018more restrictive\u2019\u200a\u201d test to the taxing power, a \n\u201cless restrictive\u201d test to the spending power, and (pre-\nsumably) still other tests to other enumerated domestic- \naffairs powers.  Br. 55 n.11, 66, 73 (citation omitted).  \nThat Goldilocks approach contravenes the century-old \ngeneral nondelegation framework that this Court has \napplied across Article I powers, including the taxing \npower, see Federal Energy Administration v. Algon-\nquin SNG, Inc., 426 U.S. 548, 559-560 (1976); the com-\nmerce power, see American Trucking, 531 U.S. at 472-\n476; the power to regulate the armed forces, see Loving \nv. United States, 517 U.S. 748, 767-768 (1996); and  \nthe power to regulate federal courts, see Mistretta v. \nUnited States, 488 U.S. 361, 371-379 (1989).  The Court \nhas declined to adopt different tests for different pow-\ners, discerning \u201cno reasons why Congress should have \n\n5 \n \nless capacity\u201d to confer discretion under some clauses \nthan under others.  Loving, 517 U.S. at 767. \nParticularly salient here, this Court has rejected \nspecial nondelegation tests for taxation.  In J.W. Hamp-\nton, Jr. & Co. v. United States, 276 U.S. 394 (1928), the \nCourt upheld a statute that empowered the President \nto set tariffs, explaining that \u201cCongress may use execu-\ntive officers in the application and enforcement of a pol-\nicy declared in law.\u201d  Id. at 409.  The challenger claimed \nthat \u201cthis never has been permitted to be done [under] \nthe power to levy taxes,\u201d but the Court observed that \n\u201c[t]he authorities make no such distinction.\u201d  Ibid.  And \nin Skinner v. Mid-America Pipeline Co., 490 U.S. 212 \n(1989), the Court applied the \u201cnormal\u201d nondelegation \nrequirements in upholding an agency\u2019s statutory au-\nthority to collect assessments from pipeline operators.  \nId. at 219.  The Court rejected \u201cthe application of a dif-\nferent and stricter nondelegation doctrine\u201d in cases in-\nvolving the \u201ctaxing power,\u201d explaining that Article I \ndoes not \u201cdistinguish Congress\u2019 power to tax from its \nother enumerated powers\u201d \u201cin terms of the scope and \ndegree of discretionary authority that Congress may \ndelegate.\u201d  Id. at 220-223.  When the Framers meant to \nsubject the taxing power to special safeguards, they did \nso.  See, e.g., U.S. Const. Art. I, \u00a7 7, Cl. 1 (origination); \n\u00a7 8, Cl. 1 (uniformity of indirect taxes); \u00a7 9, Cl. 4 (appor-\ntionment of direct taxes).  Courts may not superimpose \nadditional restrictions that the Framers left out. \nRespondents sidestep another problem:  because the \ncommerce power provides a sufficient basis for uphold-\ning Section 254, a special test for tax legislation would \nmake no difference here.  See Gov\u2019t Br. 34-35.  Respond-\nents suggest (Br. 26 n.4) that when Congress\u2019s powers \noverlap, courts should apply the most restrictive non-\n\n6 \n \ndelegation test associated with those powers\u2014here, \ntheir special tax-nondelegation test.  But constitutional-\navoidance principles counsel the opposite.  \u201cAs between \ntwo possible interpretations of a statute, by one of \nwhich it would be unconstitutional and by the other \nvalid, [a court\u2019s] plain duty is to adopt that which will \nsave the act.\u201d  Robertson v. Seattle Audubon Society, \n503 U.S. 429, 441 (1992) (brackets and citation omitted).  \nMore fundamentally, \u201c[t]he idea that the same measure \nmight, according to circumstances, be arranged with \ndifferent classes of power, was no novelty to the fram-\ners.\u201d  Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 202 (1824).  That \noverlap among the enumerated powers proves that the \nenterprise of developing different nondelegation tests \nfor different powers is misguided.  \nFinally, respondents noticeably remain \u201csilent about \nthe potential consequences of their position.\u201d  Haaland \nv. Brackeen, 599 U.S. 255, 279 (2023).  For decades, Con-\ngress has relied on this Court\u2019s longstanding nondele-\ngation framework to enact a range of important statutes \n\u2014including statutes authorizing agencies to prevent \nunfair competition, see 15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.; to oversee \nthe securities industry, see 15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.; to en-\nsure the safety of food and drugs, see 21 U.S.C. 301 et \nseq.; to regulate labor relations, see 29 U.S.C. 151 et \nseq.; and to set air-quality standards, see 42 U.S.C. 7401 \net seq.   Respondents do not explain whether their novel \nclause-by-clause test would \u201cundermine established  \n* * *  statutes\u201d\u2014and, \u201c[i]f so, which ones.\u201d  Brackeen, \n599 U.S. at 279.  That incomplete presentation justifies \nrejecting respondents\u2019 invitation (Br. 30) \u201cto realign \n[the Court\u2019s] nondelegation framework.\u201d   \n2. Respondents principally contend (Br. 35) that \nSection 254 violates Article I because their tax-specific \n\n7 \n \nnondelegation rule requires Congress to impose \u201cpre-\ncise numerical limits\u201d on agencies\u2019 collection of taxes, \nduties, fees, or the like.  But tax statutes have long in-\ncorporated general standards rather than specific num-\nbers.  For example, Congress has long enacted, and this \nCourt has frequently upheld, statutes that empower the \nPresident to set, lift, or change tariffs\u2014the main source \nof federal revenue until the 20th century.  See Algon-\nquin, 426 U.S. at 558-560; J.W. Hampton, 276 U.S. at \n409-411; Field v. Clark, 143 U.S. 649, 681-694 (1892).  In \nthe domestic sphere, many early statutes granted the \nSecretary of the Treasury broad authority to mitigate \nfees or penalties.  See, e.g., Act of June 6, 1798, ch. 49,  \n\u00a7 1, 1 Stat. 561 (empowering the Secretary to grant re-\nlief to imprisoned debtors on \u201creasonable and proper\u201d \nterms); Act of Mar. 3, 1797, ch. 18, \u00a7 2, 1 Stat. 509 (em-\npowering the Secretary to refund a \u201cjust and reasona-\nble\u201d portion of a license fee); Act of Mar. 3, 1791, ch. 15, \n\u00a7 43, 1 Stat. 209 (empowering the Secretary to remit \npenalties for non-payment of liquor taxes \u201cupon such \nterms and conditions as shall appear to him reasona-\nble\u201d).  And another early statute empowered tax boards \nto make \u201cjust and equitable\u201d adjustments to property \nvaluations for a direct real-estate tax.  Act of July 9, \n1798, ch. 70, \u00a7 22, 1 Stat. 589; see Gov\u2019t Br. 23.  Respond-\nents note (Br. 34-35) that this 1798 statute imposed an \noverall cap on the amount of revenue to be collected.  \nBut respondents do not explain why Congress must im-\npose an overall cap, yet may leave it to executive officers \nto decide which taxpayers owe how much. \nRevenue-raising statutes without precise numerical \nlimits remain common today.  For example: \n\n8 \n \n\u2022 This Court may \u201cfix [its] fees,\u201d 28 U.S.C. 1911, and \nthe Judicial Conference may fix \u201creasonable\u201d fees \nfor the courts of appeals, 28 U.S.C. 1913.  \n\u2022 The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency \n(OCC) may levy upon banks an \u201cassessment, fee, \nor other charge,\u201d as the OCC \u201cdetermines is nec-\nessary or appropriate to carry out [its] responsi-\nbilities.\u201d  12 U.S.C. 16. \n\u2022 The Federal Reserve Board may levy upon Fed-\neral Reserve Banks \u201can assessment sufficient to \npay its estimated expenses.\u201d  12 U.S.C. 243.  \n\u2022 The National Credit Union Administration Board \nmay levy upon credit unions an annual fee after \ngiving \u201cdue consideration to the expenses of the \n[agency]  * * *  and to the ability of Federal credit \nunions to pay the fee.\u201d  12 U.S.C. 1755(b). \n\u2022 Banks must pay the Federal Deposit Insurance \nCorporation \u201cany fee which the Corporation may \nby regulation prescribe, after giving due consid-\neration to the need to establish and maintain the \nreserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund.\u201d  12 \nU.S.C. 1815(d)(1).  \n\u2022 The Farm Credit Administration may levy upon \nfinancial institutions an \u201cequitable\u201d assessment to \ncover its expenses.  12 U.S.C. 2250(a)(2)(A). \n\u2022 The Federal Housing Finance Agency may levy \nupon regulated entities an assessment \u201csufficient\u201d \nto pay its \u201creasonable costs  * * *  and expenses.\u201d  \n12 U.S.C. 4516(a). \n\u2022 The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service \nmay prescribe fees \u201csufficient\u201d \u201cto cover the cost \n\n9 \n \nof providing agricultural quarantine and inspec-\ntion services.\u201d  21 U.S.C. 136a(a)(1)(A).  \n\u2022 The Postal Service may set \u201creasonable and equi-\ntable rates of postage.\u201d  39 U.S.C. 404(b).  \nOutside the revenue-raising context, this Court has \nrepeatedly upheld statutes that constrain agency dis-\ncretion with standards rather than numbers.  Under \nthose precedents, Congress may empower an agency to \nregulate milk prices in \u201cthe public interest,\u201d even if it \ndoes not provide a \u201cmathematical formula\u201d for setting \nprices.  United States v. Rock Royal Co-op., 307 U.S. \n533, 577 (1939).  Congress may empower an agency to \nset \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d natural gas rates, even if it \nprovides \u201cno formula by which the \u2018just and reasonable\u2019 \nrate is to be determined.\u201d  FPC v. Hope Natural Gas \nCo., 320 U.S. 591, 600 (1944).1  Congress may empower \nan agency to determine and recover \u201cexcessive profits\u201d \nfrom military contractors, even without prescribing \u201ca \nspecific formula\u201d or setting \u201cflat percentage limitations \nof profits.\u201d  Lichter v. United States, 334 U.S. 742, 783-\n785 (1948).  And Congress may empower an agency to \nset air-quality standards that are \u201c\u200a\u2018requisite to protect \nthe public health,\u2019\u200a\u201d even if the statute lacks \u201ca \u2018determi-\nnate criterion\u2019 for saying \u2018how much of the regulated \nharm is too much.\u2019\u200a\u201d  American Trucking, 531 U.S. at \n472, 475 (brackets and citations omitted).  Respondents \ndo not ask this Court to overrule any of those cases, in-\nstead urging a different rule for the taxing power.  But \n\u201cthe delegation of discretionary authority under Con-\ngress\u2019 taxing power is subject to no constitutional scru-\n \n1 Respondents argue (Br. 71 n.23) that Hope Natural Gas \u201cdid not \naddress nondelegation,\u201d but this Court has concluded otherwise.  \nSee Mistretta, 488 U.S. at 372-373; Skinner, 490 U.S. at 219. \n\n10 \n \ntiny greater than [the Court has] applied to other non-\ndelegation challenges.\u201d  Skinner, 490 U.S. at 223. \nThis Court\u2019s recent decision in CFPB v. CFSA, 601 \nU.S. 416 (2024), reinforces that analysis.  There, the \nCourt rejected the theory that an appropriation violates \nthe Appropriations Clause, U.S. Const. Art. I, \u00a7 9, Cl. 7, \nif it is \u201ctoo open-ended in duration and amount.\u201d  CFSA, \n601 U.S. at 426.  Appropriations, the Court explained, \n\u201cneed only identify a source of funds and authorize the \nexpenditure of those funds for designated purposes.\u201d  \nIbid.  As the dissenters observed, the Court did not \u201cre-\nquire Congress to set an upper limit on the amount of \nmoney that the Executive may take.\u201d  Id. at 448 (Alito, \nJ., dissenting).  Just as Congress need not set numerical \ncaps when spending money, it need not set such caps \nwhen raising money.  \nRespondents\u2019 rigid test would produce illogical re-\nsults.  Under that approach, a revenue-raising statute \nthat lacked a numerical limit would violate Article I, no \nmatter how much guidance it otherwise provided.  Even \nif Congress left little to the agency\u2019s discretion\u2014for in-\nstance, even if it directed the agency to provide a well-\ndefined benefit with an easily ascertainable cost and or-\ndered that the program\u2019s expenses be divided equally \namong specified payers\u2014the absence of an explicit nu-\nmerical cap would doom the legislation.     \nBy contrast, a statute that used a precise number \nwould pass muster under respondents\u2019 numerical-limit \napproach even if the statute otherwise offered no guid-\nance.  Indeed, respondents prescribe (Br. 5) \u201cadding \nhalf a sentence setting a specific tax rate or cap\u201d to fix \notherwise \u201ccontentless\u201d delegations.  On that approach, \nCongress seemingly could avoid nondelegation prob-\nlems by authorizing an agency to collect and spend up \n\n11 \n \nto one trillion dollars a year, while leaving to the agency \nall further details about whom to tax or how to spend \nthe money.  That result would hardly \u201cvindicate the sep-\naration of powers.\u201d  Resp. Br. 4.  \n3. Beyond their numerical-limit approach, respond-\nents alternatively (Br. 47-59) argue that Section 254 in-\nadequately constrains the FCC\u2019s discretion.  The con-\ntours of respondents\u2019 alternative test are unclear, but \nrespondents appear to object that Section 254 is too \n\u201chazy\u201d or \u201ccontentless.\u201d  Br. 48 (citations omitted).  Were \nthese provisions contentless,\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

On their tell-\ning (Br. 1), Congress has granted the Federal Commu-\nnications Commission (FCC) powers that King George \nIII would have envied:  \u201c[u]nbounded\u201d power to levy taxes, \nsubject at most to \u201cprecatory\u201d standards and \u201c\u200a\u2018aspira-\ntional\u2019\u200a\u201d principles.  Respondents further portray (Br. 2-\n3) the FCC as \u201chand[ing] off this revenue power\u201d to a \nprivate Administrator in defiance of \u201c600 years of  \n\n2 \n \nAnglo-American practice.\u201d  If the Universal Service \nFund really worked that way, the government would \nnot defend its constitutionality.  Congress may not vest \nfederal agencies with an unbounded taxing power.  Nor \ncan Congress or agencies delegate that power to private \nentities.  \nNeither Congress nor the FCC, however, has done \nanything of the sort.  Congress in 47 U.S.C. 254 clearly \ndelineated the policy that the FCC must pursue and the \nlimits of the FCC\u2019s authority, so that courts can police \nthe agency\u2019s compliance with Congress\u2019s commands.  \nAnd the FCC ultimately decides\u2014within the limits and \nunder the standards set by Congress\u2014the amount of \nthe contributions; the Administrator offers non-binding \nrecommendations.  Neither Congress\u2019s conferral of au-\nthority on the FCC, the FCC\u2019s reliance on advice from \nthe Administrator, nor the combination of the two vio-\nlates the Constitution.  \nA. Congress Has Not Delegated Legislative Power To The FCC \n1. Respondents criticize (Br. 30) the leniency of the \nCourt\u2019s longstanding nondelegation approach while \ntellingly declining to ask this Court to overturn its prec-\nedent.  For good reason:  that line of precedent need not \nbe toothless.  Indeed, respondents and the government \nagree on many of the nondelegation ground rules.   \nFor instance, Article I undisputedly distinguishes \nbetween foreign-affairs delegations and domestic ones.  \nArticle II gives the President the \u201clead role in foreign \npolicy.\u201d  American Insurance Ass\u2019n v. Garamendi, 539 \nU.S. 396, 415 (2003) (citations and ellipsis omitted).  This \nCourt has consistently rejected nondelegation challenges \nto statutes empowering the President to exercise sweep-\ning discretion in managing foreign affairs.  See, e.g., \n\n3 \n \nUnited States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299 U.S. \n304, 314-329 (1936); see Resp. Br. 39-41.   \nBy contrast, all agree that the nondelegation rules \nare stricter in the domestic context.  Even then, Con-\ngress \u201cmay commit something to the discretion\u201d of the \nExecutive.  Wayman v. Southard, 10 Wheat. 1, 46 (1825); \nsee Resp. Br. 76.  A \u201cdegree of discretion\u201d \u201cinheres in \nmost executive\u201d action.  Whitman v. American Truck-\ning Ass\u2019ns, 531 U.S. 457, 475 (2001) (citation omitted).  \nAnd legislation often involves \u201cdetails with which the \nnational legislature cannot deal directly.\u201d  Panama Re-\nfining Co. v. Ryan, 293 U.S. 388, 421 (1935); see Gundy \nv.

And while this case does not pre-\nsent the issue, Article I may impose further limits on \ndelegations of authority to decide \u201cmajor policy ques-\ntions.\u201d  Paul v. United States, 140 S. Ct. 342, 342 (2019) \n(statement of Kavanaugh, J.). \nBut respondents go too far in arguing that \u201cthe level \nof statutory specificity required by the nondelegation \ndoctrine varies\u201d from power to power, so that courts must \napply a \u201c\u200a\u2018more restrictive\u2019\u200a\u201d test to the taxing power, a \n\u201cless restrictive\u201d test to the spending power, and (pre-\nsumably) still other tests to other enumerated domestic- \naffairs powers.  Br. 55 n.11, 66, 73 (citation omitted).  \nThat Goldilocks approach contravenes the century-old \ngeneral nondelegation framework that this Court has \napplied across Article I powers, including the taxing \npower, see Federal Energy Administration v. Algon-\nquin SNG, Inc., 426 U.S. 548, 559-560 (1976); the com-\nmerce power, see American Trucking, 531 U.S. at 472-\n476; the power to regulate the armed forces, see Loving \nv. United States, 517 U.S. 748, 767-768 (1996); and  \nthe power to regulate federal courts, see Mistretta v. \nUnited States, 488 U.S. 361, 371-379 (1989).  The Court \nhas declined to adopt different tests for different pow-\ners, discerning \u201cno reasons why Congress should have \n\n5 \n \nless capacity\u201d to confer discretion under some clauses \nthan under others.  Loving, 517 U.S. at 767. \nParticularly salient here, this Court has rejected \nspecial nondelegation tests for taxation.  In J.W. Hamp-\nton, Jr. & Co. v. United States, 276 U.S. 394 (1928), the \nCourt upheld a statute that empowered the President \nto set tariffs, explaining that \u201cCongress may use execu-\ntive officers in the application and enforcement of a pol-\nicy declared in law.\u201d  Id. at 409.  The challenger claimed \nthat \u201cthis never has been permitted to be done [under] \nthe power to levy taxes,\u201d but the Court observed that \n\u201c[t]he authorities make no such distinction.\u201d  Ibid.  And \nin Skinner v. Mid-America Pipeline Co., 490 U.S. 212 \n(1989), the Court applied the \u201cnormal\u201d nondelegation \nrequirements in upholding an agency\u2019s statutory au-\nthority to collect assessments from pipeline operators.  \nId. at 219.  The Court rejected \u201cthe application of a dif-\nferent and stricter nondelegation doctrine\u201d in cases in-\nvolving the \u201ctaxing power,\u201d explaining that Article I \ndoes not \u201cdistinguish Congress\u2019 power to tax from its \nother enumerated powers\u201d \u201cin terms of the scope and \ndegree of discretionary authority that Congress may \ndelegate.\u201d  Id. at 220-223.  When the Framers meant to \nsubject the taxing power to special safeguards, they did \nso.  See, e.g., U.S. Const. Art. I, \u00a7 7, Cl. 1 (origination); \n\u00a7 8, Cl. 1 (uniformity of indirect taxes); \u00a7 9, Cl. 4 (appor-\ntionment of direct taxes).  Courts may not superimpose \nadditional restrictions that the Framers left out. \nRespondents sidestep another problem:  because the \ncommerce power provides a sufficient basis for uphold-\ning Section 254, a special test for tax legislation would \nmake no difference here.  See Gov\u2019t Br. 34-35.  Respond-\nents suggest (Br. 26 n.4) that when Congress\u2019s powers \noverlap, courts should apply the most restrictive non-\n\n6 \n \ndelegation test associated with those powers\u2014here, \ntheir special tax-nondelegation test.  But constitutional-\navoidance principles counsel the opposite.  \u201cAs between \ntwo possible interpretations of a statute, by one of \nwhich it would be unconstitutional and by the other \nvalid, [a court\u2019s] plain duty is to adopt that which will \nsave the act.\u201d  Robertson v. Seattle Audubon Society, \n503 U.S. 429, 441 (1992) (brackets and citation omitted).  \nMore fundamentally, \u201c[t]he idea that the same measure \nmight, according to circumstances, be arranged with \ndifferent classes of power, was no novelty to the fram-\ners.\u201d  Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 202 (1824).  That \noverlap among the enumerated powers proves that the \nenterprise of developing different nondelegation tests \nfor different powers is misguided.  \nFinally, respondents noticeably remain \u201csilent about \nthe potential consequences of their position.\u201d  Haaland \nv. Brackeen, 599 U.S. 255, 279 (2023).  For decades, Con-\ngress has relied on this Court\u2019s longstanding nondele-\ngation framework to enact a range of important statutes \n\u2014including statutes authorizing agencies to prevent \nunfair competition, see 15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.; to oversee \nthe securities industry, see 15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.; to en-\nsure the safety of food and drugs, see 21 U.S.C. 301 et \nseq.; to regulate labor relations, see 29 U.S.C. 151 et \nseq.; and to set air-quality standards, see 42 U.S.C. 7401 \net seq.   Respondents do not explain whether their novel \nclause-by-clause test would \u201cundermine established  \n* * *  statutes\u201d\u2014and, \u201c[i]f so, which ones.\u201d  Brackeen, \n599 U.S. at 279.  That incomplete presentation justifies \nrejecting respondents\u2019 invitation (Br. 30) \u201cto realign \n[the Court\u2019s] nondelegation framework.\u201d   \n2. Respondents principally contend (Br. 35) that \nSection 254 violates Article I because their tax-specific \n\n7 \n \nnondelegation rule requires Congress to impose \u201cpre-\ncise numerical limits\u201d on agencies\u2019 collection of taxes, \nduties, fees, or the like.  But tax statutes have long in-\ncorporated general standards rather than specific num-\nbers.  For example, Congress has long enacted, and this \nCourt has frequently upheld, statutes that empower the \nPresident to set, lift, or change tariffs\u2014the main source \nof federal revenue until the 20th century.  See Algon-\nquin, 426 U.S. at 558-560; J.W. Hampton, 276 U.S. at \n409-411; Field v. Clark, 143 U.S. 649, 681-694 (1892).  In \nthe domestic sphere, many early statutes granted the \nSecretary of the Treasury broad authority to mitigate \nfees or penalties.  See, e.g., Act of June 6, 1798, ch. 49,  \n\u00a7 1, 1 Stat. 561 (empowering the Secretary to grant re-\nlief to imprisoned debtors on \u201creasonable and proper\u201d \nterms); Act of Mar. 3, 1797, ch. 18, \u00a7 2, 1 Stat. 509 (em-\npowering the Secretary to refund a \u201cjust and reasona-\nble\u201d portion of a license fee); Act of Mar. 3, 1791, ch. 15, \n\u00a7 43, 1 Stat. 209 (empowering the Secretary to remit \npenalties for non-payment of liquor taxes \u201cupon such \nterms and conditions as shall appear to him reasona-\nble\u201d).  And another early statute empowered tax boards \nto make \u201cjust and equitable\u201d adjustments to property \nvaluations for a direct real-estate tax.  Act of July 9, \n1798, ch. 70, \u00a7 22, 1 Stat. 589; see Gov\u2019t Br. 23.  Respond-\nents note (Br. 34-35) that this 1798 statute imposed an \noverall cap on the amount of revenue to be collected.  \nBut respondents do not explain why Congress must im-\npose an overall cap, yet may leave it to executive officers \nto decide which taxpayers owe how much. \nRevenue-raising statutes without precise numerical \nlimits remain common today.  For example: \n\n8 \n \n\u2022 This Court may \u201cfix [its] fees,\u201d 28 U.S.C. 1911, and \nthe Judicial Conference may fix \u201creasonable\u201d fees \nfor the courts of appeals, 28 U.S.C. 1913.  \n\u2022 The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency \n(OCC) may levy upon banks an \u201cassessment, fee, \nor other charge,\u201d as the OCC \u201cdetermines is nec-\nessary or appropriate to carry out [its] responsi-\nbilities.\u201d  12 U.S.C. 16. \n\u2022 The Federal Reserve Board may levy upon Fed-\neral Reserve Banks \u201can assessment sufficient to \npay its estimated expenses.\u201d  12 U.S.C. 243.  \n\u2022 The National Credit Union Administration Board \nmay levy upon credit unions an annual fee after \ngiving \u201cdue consideration to the expenses of the \n[agency]  * * *  and to the ability of Federal credit \nunions to pay the fee.\u201d  12 U.S.C. 1755(b). \n\u2022 Banks must pay the Federal Deposit Insurance \nCorporation \u201cany fee which the Corporation may \nby regulation prescribe, after giving due consid-\neration to the need to establish and maintain the \nreserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund.\u201d  12 \nU.S.C. 1815(d)(1).  \n\u2022 The Farm Credit Administration may levy upon \nfinancial institutions an \u201cequitable\u201d assessment to \ncover its expenses.  12 U.S.C. 2250(a)(2)(A). \n\u2022 The Federal Housing Finance Agency may levy \nupon regulated entities an assessment \u201csufficient\u201d \nto pay its \u201creasonable costs  * * *  and expenses.\u201d  \n12 U.S.C. 4516(a). \n\u2022 The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service \nmay prescribe fees \u201csufficient\u201d \u201cto cover the cost \n\n9 \n \nof providing agricultural quarantine and inspec-\ntion services.\u201d  21 U.S.C. 136a(a)(1)(A).  \n\u2022 The Postal Service may set \u201creasonable and equi-\ntable rates of postage.\u201d  39 U.S.C. 404(b).  \nOutside the revenue-raising context, this Court has \nrepeatedly upheld statutes that constrain agency dis-\ncretion with standards rather than numbers.  Under \nthose precedents, Congress may empower an agency to \nregulate milk prices in \u201cthe public interest,\u201d even if it \ndoes not provide a \u201cmathematical formula\u201d for setting \nprices.  United States v. Rock Royal Co-op., 307 U.S. \n533, 577 (1939).  Congress may empower an agency to \nset \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d natural gas rates, even if it \nprovides \u201cno formula by which the \u2018just and reasonable\u2019 \nrate is to be determined.\u201d  FPC v. Hope Natural Gas \nCo., 320 U.S. 591, 600 (1944).1  Congress may empower \nan agency to determine and recover \u201cexcessive profits\u201d \nfrom military contractors, even without prescribing \u201ca \nspecific formula\u201d or setting \u201cflat percentage limitations \nof profits.\u201d  Lichter v. United States, 334 U.S. 742, 783-\n785 (1948).  And Congress may empower an agency to \nset air-quality standards that are \u201c\u200a\u2018requisite to protect \nthe public health,\u2019\u200a\u201d even if the statute lacks \u201ca \u2018determi-\nnate criterion\u2019 for saying \u2018how much of the regulated \nharm is too much.\u2019\u200a\u201d  American Trucking, 531 U.S. at \n472, 475 (brackets and citations omitted).  Respondents \ndo not ask this Court to overrule any of those cases, in-\nstead urging a different rule for the taxing power.  But \n\u201cthe delegation of discretionary authority under Con-\ngress\u2019 taxing power is subject to no constitutional scru-\n \n1 Respondents argue (Br. 71 n.23) that Hope Natural Gas \u201cdid not \naddress nondelegation,\u201d but this Court has concluded otherwise.  \nSee Mistretta, 488 U.S. at 372-373; Skinner, 490 U.S. at 219. \n\n10 \n \ntiny greater than [the Court has] applied to other non-\ndelegation challenges.\u201d  Skinner, 490 U.S. at 223. \nThis Court\u2019s recent decision in CFPB v. CFSA, 601 \nU.S. 416 (2024), reinforces that analysis.  There, the \nCourt rejected the theory that an appropriation violates \nthe Appropriations Clause, U.S. Const. Art. I, \u00a7 9, Cl. 7, \nif it is \u201ctoo open-ended in duration and amount.\u201d  CFSA, \n601 U.S. at 426.  Appropriations, the Court explained, \n\u201cneed only identify a source of funds and authorize the \nexpenditure of those funds for designated purposes.\u201d  \nIbid.  As the dissenters observed, the Court did not \u201cre-\nquire Congress to set an upper limit on the amount of \nmoney that the Executive may take.\u201d  Id. at 448 (Alito, \nJ., dissenting).  Just as Congress need not set numerical \ncaps when spending money, it need not set such caps \nwhen raising money.  \nRespondents\u2019 rigid test would produce illogical re-\nsults.  Under that approach, a revenue-raising statute \nthat lacked a numerical limit would violate Article I, no \nmatter how much guidance it otherwise provided.  Even \nif Congress left little to the agency\u2019s discretion\u2014for in-\nstance, even if it directed the agency to provide a well-\ndefined benefit with an easily ascertainable cost and or-\ndered that the program\u2019s expenses be divided equally \namong specified payers\u2014the absence of an explicit nu-\nmerical cap would doom the legislation.     \nBy contrast, a statute that used a precise number \nwould pass muster under respondents\u2019 numerical-limit \napproach even if the statute otherwise offered no guid-\nance.  Indeed, respondents prescribe (Br. 5) \u201cadding \nhalf a sentence setting a specific tax rate or cap\u201d to fix \notherwise \u201ccontentless\u201d delegations.  On that approach, \nCongress seemingly could avoid nondelegation prob-\nlems by authorizing an agency to collect and spend up \n\n11 \n \nto one trillion dollars a year, while leaving to the agency \nall further details about whom to tax or how to spend \nthe money.  That result would hardly \u201cvindicate the sep-\naration of powers.\u201d  Resp. Br. 4.  \n3. Beyond their numerical-limit approach, respond-\nents alternatively (Br. 47-59) argue that Section 254 in-\nadequately constrains the FCC\u2019s discretion.  The con-\ntours of respondents\u2019 alternative test are unclear, but \nrespondents appear to object that Section 254 is too \n\u201chazy\u201d or \u201ccontentless.\u201d  Br. 48 (citations omitted).  Were \nthese provisions contentless, the government would not \ndefend their constitutionality.  In reality, Section 254 \ncontains constitutionally adequate limits.  It sets forth \nthe \u201cgeneral policy\u201d that the FCC must pursue and the \n\u201cboundaries of th[e] delegated authority,\u201d American \nPower & Light, 329 U.S. at 105, and uses \u201csufficiently \ndefinite\u201d terms to enable courts to judge whether the \nagency has followed Congress\u2019s instructions, Gundy, \n588 U.S. at 158 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting) (citation omit-\nted).   \nSection 254\u2019s list of universal service principles, see \n47 U.S.C. 254(b), delineates the general policy that the \nFCC must pursue.  Respondents dismiss (Br. 47-50) these \nprinciples as nonbinding aspirations or mere procedural \nrequirements because each uses the word \u201cshould.\u201d  \nThe whole list, however, begins with the command that \n\u201cthe Commission shall base policies  * * *  on the follow-\ning principles.\u201d  47 U.S.C. 254(b) (emphasis added).  The \nmandatory \u201cshall\u201d requires the FCC to follow the prin-\nciples.  The word \u201cshould\u201d merely allows the FCC to \n\u201cbalance the principles against one another when they \nconflict,\u201d Qwest Corp. v. FCC, 258 F.3d 1191, 1200 (10th \nCir. 2001)\u2014e.g., when pursuing one of the principles \nwould require so high a contribution factor that services \n\n12 \n \nwould no longer be \u201caffordable,\u201d 47 U.S.C. 254(b)(1).  \nThe FCC\u2019s ability to balance competing factors does not \nviolate Article I; regulation routinely involves making \nsuch tradeoffs.  See, e.g., Michigan v. EPA, 576 U.S. \n743, 752-753 (2015) (requiring agency to balance envi-\nronmental benefits and economic costs).  \nRespondents contend that the FCC has described \nthe statutory principles as aspirations that the agency \n\u201cneed not implement.\u201d  Br. 47 (citation omitted).  That \ntakes the FCC\u2019s statements out of context.  The FCC \nmerely argued that it \u201cneed not implement [a particular \nprinciple] in light of other valid statutory objectives.\u201d  \nGov\u2019t Br. at 26-27, Texas Office of Public Utility Coun-\nsel v. FCC, 265 F.3d 313 (5th Cir. 2001) (No. 00-60434) \n(emphasis added).  That comports with the govern-\nment\u2019s position here:  The FCC may balance conflicting \nprinciples against each other, but \u201cmay not depart from \nthem altogether to achieve some other goal.\u201d  Qwest, \n258 F.3d at 1200.  Anyway, the nondelegation issue turns \non Congress\u2019s statutory language, not on the FCC\u2019s lit-\nigating positions.  Just as agencies cannot \u201ccure an un-\nlawful delegation\u201d by disclaiming power that Congress \ngranted, American Trucking, 531 U.S. at 472, agencies \ncannot invalidate a lawful conferral of discretion by er-\nroneously claiming power that Congress did not grant. \nRespondents further assert that the principles \u201ccan-\nnot possibly constrain the FCC\u2019s policymaking discre-\ntion in any meaningful way.\u201d  Br. 48 (citation omitted).  \nThat is incorrect.  Because Congress directed that con-\ntributions be \u201cequitable and nondiscriminatory,\u201d 47 \nU.S.C. 254(b)(4), the FCC may not adopt a progressive \nfee structure in which more profitable carriers pay \nhigher rates.  Because Congress directed that rural and \nurban services be available at \u201creasonably comparable\u201d \n\n13 \n \nrates, 47 U.S.C. 254(b)(3), the FCC may not seek to \nmake rural services cheaper than urban ones.  Because \nCongress directed that schools and libraries have ac-\ncess to \u201caffordable\u201d services, 47 U.S.C. 254(h)(1)(B), the \nFCC may not seek to make those services entirely free.  \nAnd courts of appeals have invalidated FCC actions \nwhen the agency has failed to adhere to the principles. \nIn one case, a court held that the FCC had not ade-\nquately explained why a subsidy would ensure that ru-\nral rates were \u201creasonably comparable\u201d to urban rates.  \nSee Qwest, 258 F.3d at 1202-1203.  In another, a court \nfaulted the FCC for \u201cfocusing solely\u201d on one principle \nwhile \u201cignor[ing]\u201d other principles.  Qwest Communica-\ntions International, Inc. v. FCC, 398 F.3d 1222, 1234 \n(10th Cir. 2005). \nSection 254 also clearly delineates \u201cthe boundaries of \nth[e] delegated authority.\u201d  American Power & Light, \n329 U.S. at 105.  Section 254 identifies who must pay \n(telecommunications carriers), the terms on which they \nmust pay (on an equitable and nondiscriminatory basis), \nand the conditions for an exemption (the contribution \nwould be de minimis).  See 47 U.S.C. 254(d).  And Sec-\ntion 254 identifies the program\u2019s beneficiaries (rural ar-\neas, rural health care providers, low-income consumers, \nand schools and libraries), the types of services that the \nFCC may fund (telecommunications services), and the \npurposes for which funds may be used (the provision, \nmaintenance, and upgrading of facilities and services).  \nSee 47 U.S.C. 254(b), (c), (e), and (h).  Courts have in-\nvalidated FCC action that violates those requirements.  \nSee Gov\u2019t Br. 34.  \nSection 254, in addition, contains specific rules about \nthe scope of the individual programs.  See Gov\u2019t Br. 27-\n28.  Take the metric for calculating subsidies to rural \n\n14 \n \nhealth care providers:  carriers must provide services \n\u201cat rates that are reasonably comparable to rates charged \nfor similar services in urban areas,\u201d and then may re-\ncoup from the Universal Service Fund \u201cthe difference\u201d \nbetween the rural rate that they would normally charge \nand the urban rates that the statute required them to \ncharge.  47 U.S.C. 254(h)(1)(A).  Those provisions set \nforth \u201cobjective limits,\u201d Resp. Br. 44, on the FCC\u2019s \nmanagement of the Universal Service Fund.  \nSection 254 further directs carriers to contribute to \nthe \u201csufficient mechanisms established by the Commis-\nsion to preserve and advance universal service.\u201d  47 U.S.C. \n254(d).  Respondents counter (Br. 56) that the suffi-\nciency requirement \u201cimposes at best a floor,\u201d \u201cnot a ceil-\ning.\u201d  But \u201can agency literally has no power to act\u201d \u201cun-\nless and until Congress confers power upon it.\u201d  New \nYork v. FERC, 535 U.S. 1, 18 (2002) (citation omitted).  \nSection 254 authorizes the FCC to collect contributions \nto support \u201csufficient\u201d universal service subsidies\u2014but \nno more.  47 U.S.C. 254(d); see Gov\u2019t Br. 29-30.  The word \n\u201csufficient\u201d leaves some flexibility, see Loper Bright En-\nterprises v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369, 395 (2024), while \nplacing an upper limit on the programs\u2019 size and budget.  \nRespondents also argue (Br. 3, 53) that \u201cthe defini-\ntion of \u2018universal service\u2019 itself\u200a\u201d lacks a \u201cmeaningful \nlimit\u201d and \u201cevolv[es]\u201d over time.  But universal service \nis a concept that the FCC has long pursued as \u201ca basic \ngoal of telecommunications regulation.\u201d  Texas Office of \nPublic Utility Counsel v. FCC, 183 F.3d 393, 405 (5th \nCir. 1999).  By 1996, when Congress enacted Section \n254, the FCC had spent decades seeking to achieve that \ngoal by capping the rates that providers could charge to \ncategories of customers who might otherwise find ser-\nvice unaffordable.  See Gov\u2019t Br. 2-3.  To be sure, Sec-\n\n15 \n \ntion 254 reformed the mechanism through which the \nFCC must achieve universal service, effectively replac-\ning the prior implicit subsidies with explicit ones.  But \nthe 1996 Congress left the concept of universal service \nitself intact.  See ibid.   \nThe FCC\u2019s regulatory practice before 1996 therefore \nconstitutes a \u201cpre-existing\u201d body of law that can supply \n\u201cmeaningful guidance\u201d about Section 254\u2019s contours.  \nGundy, 588 U.S. at 160 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting); see \nLoper Bright, 603 U.S. at 388 (agency practice \u201cconsti-\ntute[s] a body of experience and informed judgment\u201d to \nwhich courts, litigants, and the agency itself may \u201cpro-\nperly resort for guidance\u201d) (citation omitted).  That his-\ntory gives content to Section 254\u2019s language and further \nconstrains the FCC\u2019s discretion.  Cf. Fahey v. Mallonee, \n332 U.S. 245, 250, 254 (1947) (rejecting a nondelegation \nchallenge to a banking statute because the \u201caccumu-\nlated experience\u201d of bank regulation would help limit \nthe agency\u2019s discretion). \nFinally, Section 254 confines the FCC\u2019s authority to \none industry: telecommunications services.  That mat-\nters because Congress may permissibly confer more \ndiscretion when empowering an agency to regulate \u201ca \nsingle type of enterprise\u201d than when it empowers the \nagency to deal with the \u201ceconomic problems of varied \nindustries.\u201d Mallonee, 332 U.S. at 250.  Congress must \nprovide more guidance on \u201cstandards that affect the en-\ntire national economy\u201d than on \u201cregulations governing \ngrain elevators.\u201d  American Trucking, 531 U.S. at 475; \nsee Chamber of Commerce Amicus Br. 2-3.   \n4. Respondents separately argue that Section 254 \nviolates Article I because it allows the FCC to \u201crewrite \nits own authority\u201d by adopting new universal service \nprinciples.  Br. 50 (capitalization omitted).  But those \n\n16 \n \nnew principles can only further limit the FCC\u2019s discre-\ntion.  Because new principles must be \u201cconsistent with\u201d \nthe remainder of the statute, 47 U.S.C. 254(b)(7), they \ncannot supersede the limits that Congress elsewhere \nimposed.   \nRespondents are similarly incorrect in arguing (Br. \n53-56) that Section 254 allows the FCC to redefine uni-\nversal service itself.  The statute retains the core mean-\ning of universal service: ensuring, \u201cso far as possible,\u201d \nthat \u201call the people of the United States\u201d have access to \nbasic telecommunications services \u201cwith adequate facil-\nities at reasonable charges.\u201d  47 U.S.C. 151.  Section 254 \ninstead authorizes the FCC to identify the types of tele-\ncommunications services that the Universal Service \nFund should subsidize\u2014e.g., voice telephony\u2014\u201ctaking \ninto account advances in telecommunications and infor-\nmation technologies.\u201d  47 U.S.C. 254(c).  Even then, the \nFCC must apply detailed statutory criteria, such as con-\nsidering the extent to which a service has, \u201cthrough the \noperation of market choices by customers, been sub-\nscribed to by a substantial majority of residential cus-\ntomers.\u201d  47 U.S.C. 254(c)(1)(B).  Those criteria would \npreclude subsidizing, say, telegrams or fax machines.  \n5. Finally, respondents call the Universal Service \nFund \u201c\u200a\u2018unique\u2019 in the country\u2019s history.\u201d  Br. 2 (citation \nomitted).  That overlooks the pre-1996 statutory regime \nfor universal service, which respondents have never \nchallenged as unconstitutional.  Yet that regime sup-\nplied significantly less guidance than Section 254.  For \ndecades until 1996, the FCC promoted universal service \nprimarily through its power to set \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d \nrates.  Communications Act of 1934, ch. 652, \u00a7 201(b), 48 \nStat. 1070 (47 U.S.C. 151 et seq.); see Gov\u2019t Br. 2-3.  \nWhen exercising that power, the FCC did not have to \n\n17 \n \nfollow rate caps, limit assistance to particular types of \nservices or classes of beneficiaries, or adhere to listed \nprinciples.  Nonetheless, this Court repeatedly upheld \nsimilar statutes empowering agencies to set \u201cjust and \nreasonable\u201d rates, see Hope Natural Gas, 320 U.S. at \n600, or \u201cfair and equitable\u201d prices, see Yakus, 321 U.S. \nat 420-427, because those statutes gave \u201cample indica-\ntions of the various factors to be considered\u201d by the \nagency, Rock Royal, 307 U.S. at 577.   \nIt would thus be perverse to conclude that Congress \ncrossed the constitutional line by tightening the limits \non the FCC in Section 254.  Unlike the pre-1996 regime, \nSection 254 specifies who may receive subsidies, see 47 \nU.S.C. 254(e) and (h), and the types of services that the \nFund may subsidize, see 47 U.S.C. 254(c).  Because a \nprovider\u2019s universal service contribution may be passed \non to customers, the FCC in determining the amount of \nthe contribution factor effectively determines one com-\nponent of the rate that the provider\u2019s customers will \npay.  The authority to establish that component is \nclearly narrower than the FCC\u2019s prior authority to set \n\u201cjust and reasonable\u201d rates.   \nMore broadly, \u201c[w]hether or not the [Fund] has an ex-\nact replica, its essentials are nothing new.\u201d  CFSA, 601 \nU.S. at 445 (Kagan, J., concurring).  Since the Found-\ning, Congress has obtained the \u201cassistance\u201d of the Ex-\necutive by granting agencies the \u201cdiscretion\u201d to issue \nregulations \u201cdirecting the details of [a statute\u2019s] execu-\ntion.\u201d  J.W. Hampton, 276 U.S. at 406; see Gov\u2019t Br. 21-\n23.  Congress has often limited agency discretion through \nqualitative standards rather than through \u201cspecific for-\nmula[s].\u201d  Lichter, 334 U.S. at 785; see Gov\u2019t Br. 20-21.  \nAnd \u201c[f\u200a]rom its earliest days to the present,\u201d Congress \n\u201chas varied the degree of specificity and the consequent \n\n18 \n \ndegree of discretionary authority delegated to the Ex-\necutive\u201d \u201cwhen enacting tax legislation.\u201d  Skinner, 490 \nU.S. at 221; see Gov\u2019t Br. 23.   \nB. The FCC Has Not Subdelegated Legislative Power To \nThe Administrator \nRespondents separately argue (Br. 74-88) that the \nFCC has unlawfully delegated governmental power to a \nprivate Administrator.  In doing so, they conflate ana-\nlytically distinct constitutional principles.  The court of \nappeals held only that the Administrator unlawfully ex-\nercises legislative power, see Pet. App. 55a n.18, yet re-\nspondents now suggest (Br. 74) that the Administrator \nunlawfully exercises executive power.  And this case in-\nvolves an agency\u2019s reliance on a private body\u2019s assis-\ntance, yet respondents invoke (ibid.) a case concerning \na direct delegation of power from Congress to a private \nbody without the involvement of an agency. \nThose distinctions matter.  Article I flatly forbids \ndelegations of legislative power.  If Congress impermis-\nsibly delegated legislative power to the FCC, that prob-\nlem is fatal regardless of any ensuing subdelegation.  If \nCongress permissibly constrained the FCC, however, \nthere is no legislative delegation, and the FCC\u2019s delega-\ntion to the Administrator implicates executive power.  \nBut Article II generally permits delegations of the \npower to execute the laws, so long as all executive power \nremains subject to the President\u2019s control.  See Myers \nv. United States, 272 U.S. 52, 117 (1926); Mistretta, 488 \nU.S. at 425-426 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  And while Con-\ngress may not delegate legislative power to a private \nbody, a private body may \u201coperate as an aid\u201d to an \nagency.  Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v. Adkins, 310 \nU.S. 381, 388 (1940). \n\n19 \n \nConceptual problems aside, respondents\u2019 theory is \nwrong under any conception of nondelegation to private \nentities.  The FCC, not the Administrator, sets the quar-\nterly contribution factor within the limits Congress pre-\nscribed; the Administrator just recommends how to ex-\nercise that authority.  Respondents\u2019 constitutional ob-\njections (Br. 79-83) to the Administrator\u2019s advisory role \nare unsound.  \n1. Respondents first contend (Br. 79-82) that the \nAdministrator\u2019s projections can take effect without the \nFCC\u2019s approval.  The government agrees there would \nbe a nondelegation problem if an agency empowered a \nprivate actor to adopt rules without the agency\u2019s ap-\nproval.  Indeed, empowering that private actor to adopt \nbinding rules governing private conduct on a continuing \nbasis would make that actor an officer of the United \nStates subject to the Appointments Clause, U.S. Const. \nArt. II, \u00a7 2, Cl. 2.  But the FCC has not granted such au-\nthority to the Administrator, whose projections \u201cmust \nbe approved by the Commission before they are used to \ncalculate the quarterly contribution factor.\u201d  47 C.F.R. \n54.709(a)(3) (emphasis added).   \nFurther, the FCC\u2019s rules require the Administrator \nto submit projections of program expenses to the FCC\u2019s \nOffice of the Managing Director at least 60 days before \nthe start of the quarter.  See 47 C.F.R. 54.709(a)(3).  The \nAdministrator must also report the \u201ctotal contribution \nbase\u201d (i.e., the carriers\u2019 total projected assessable reve-\nnues) to the FCC at least 30 days before the start of the \nquarter.  Ibid.  The FCC\u2019s staff reviews\u2014and if neces-\nsary revises\u2014the projections.  See Memorandum of \nUnderstanding Between the Federal Communications \nCommission and the Universal Service Administrative \nCompany 7 (Oct. 17, 2024) (providing that the Manag-\n\n20 \n \ning Director \u201cshall review\u201d the Administrator\u2019s filings); \nPet. App. 144a (adjusting the reported contribution \nbase).  After that staff review, the FCC calculates the \ncontribution factor and announces it in a public notice.  \nSee 47 C.F.R. 54.709(a)(3).  The factor takes effect after \n14 days unless the FCC revises it in the meantime.  Ibid. \nThe FCC, not the Administrator, thus promulgates \nthe contribution factor in a public notice.  The Adminis-\ntrator simply provides data that the FCC reviews, re-\nvises, and then uses in calculating that factor.  The Ad-\nministrator\u2019s performance of that accountant-like advi-\nsory role poses no constitutional concerns.  \nRespondents focus (Br. 80) on an FCC rule stating \nthat the contribution factor is \u201cdeemed approved\u201d after \n14 days.  See 47 C.F.R. 54.709(a)(3).  But that provision \nsimply gives the FCC an additional 14-day period to re-\nvise the contribution factor that the FCC (via the Man-\naging Director) previously announced, if the FCC de-\ntermines that a revision is warranted.  Even before that \n14-day period, the FCC reviews and (if necessary) re-\nvises the Administrator\u2019s projections, uses the projec-\ntions to calculate the contribution factor, and issues a \npublic notice promulgating that factor.  The public no-\ntice itself provides the \u201cformal approval\u201d that respond-\nents insist (Br. 81) the Constitution requires.  Nothing \nin the regulatory scheme allows any determination of \nthe Administrator to have operative legal effect without \nthe FCC\u2019s express approval. \nRespondents liken this process to a hypothetical \nstatute that provides, \u201cThe defense budget is whatever \nLockheed Martin wants it to be, unless Congress or an \nagency intervenes to revise it.\u201d  Br. 86 (brackets and ci-\ntation omitted).  That analogy ignores all the interven-\ning steps between the Administrator\u2019s submission of the \n\n21 \n \nprojections and the FCC\u2019s final approval of the contri-\nbution factor.  Rather, this process is more like the fol-\nlowing:  a law clerk prepares a draft opinion; a judge \nreviews and revises the draft before issuing the opinion; \nthe opinion then becomes final 14 days later, once the \nrehearing deadline expires.  Just as the law clerk does \nnot exercise delegated judicial power by advising the \njudge at the first stage of the opinion-writing process, \nthe Administrator does not exercise subdelegated leg-\nislative power by advising the FCC at the first stage of \nthe contribution-setting process.  Contrary to respond-\nents\u2019 suggestion, the government is not relying on the \nFCC\u2019s ability to \u201cclaw back\u201d the authority granted to \nthe Administrator, Br. 84 (citation omitted).  Rather, \nthe key is that the Administrator\u2019s proposals take legal \neffect only if the FCC approves them.  \n2. Respondents object that the FCC \u201crubber \nstamp[s]\u201d the Administrator\u2019s work rather than \u201cinde-\npendently\u201d reviewing it.  Br. 82 (citation omitted).  That \nargument is factually incorrect and legally irrelevant.  \nFactually, as the government has noted (Gov\u2019t Br. 47) \nand as respondents concede (Br. 82-83), the FCC has \nrevised projections when it has considered revisions to \nbe warranted under the statute and rules.  That the FCC \nhas done so infrequently reflects the Administrator\u2019s \nlimited role and the detailed regulations constraining \nits actions.  Gov\u2019t Br. 47.  Legally, what matters is that \nthe Administrator\u2019s work cannot become final without \nthe FCC\u2019s approval\u2014not how often the FCC disapproves.    \nConsistent with the Constitution, myriad private ac-\ntors make recommendations to the government.  The \nlawfulness of such consultation does not turn on a judi-\ncial inquiry into how much weight the government gives \nthose recommendations.  A party could not challenge a \n\n22 \n \nstatute on the ground that members of Congress made \ntoo few changes to a blue-ribbon commission\u2019s draft bill.  \nA party likewise could not challenge a Federal Rule on \nthe ground that this Court made no changes to the rules \ncommittee\u2019s proposal.  Respondents identify no good \nreason to treat challenges to agency action any differ-\nently.   \nRespondents seek to minimize (Br. 61-64) the practi-\ncal consequences of their position.  But Congress has \nenacted many statutes\u2014ranging from the Rules Ena-\nbling Act, 28 U.S.C. 2071 et seq., to the Beef Promotion \nand Research Act of 1985, 7 U.S.C. 2901 et seq.\u2014that \nempower governmental bodies to promulgate rules af-\nter considering private advice. This Court should not \ncall untold numbers of federal statutes into question \nwithout offering clear guideposts for Congress and the \nExecutive Branch going forward. \n3.  This Court need not consider whether the private \nnondelegation doctrine allows private actors to perform \nministerial tasks.  See Resp. Br. 77.  The Fifth Circuit \nagreed that \u201cministerial tasks could be subdelegated,\u201d \nPet. App. 56a, but the \u201cline between a discretionary and \na ministerial act is not always easy to mark,\u201d Cantwell \nv. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 306 (1940).  This Court can \nresolve the case on the simpler ground that the Admin-\nistrator plays only an advisory role in the contribution-\nsetting process.2  \n \n2 Justice Thomas recently questioned whether the creation of the \nUniversal Service Administrative Company complied with the Gov-\nernment Corporation Control Act, 31 U.S.C. 9101 et seq.  See Wis-\nconsin Bell, Inc. v. United States ex rel. Heath, 145 S. Ct. 498, 513-\n515 (2025) (Thomas, J., concurring).  That law provides that the gov-\nernment \u201cmay establish or acquire a corporation as an agency\u201d only \nwith specific statutory authorization.  31 U.S.C. 9102.  Because the \n\n23 \n \nC. Respondents\u2019 Remaining Arguments Are Incorrect \nRespondents briefly defend (Br. 88-89) the court of \nappeals\u2019 theory that the combination of Congress\u2019s \ngrant of authority to the FCC and the FCC\u2019s reliance \non the Administrator violates the Constitution even if \nneither delegation on its own is unconstitutional.  That \ntheory makes no sense.  Congress cannot delegate leg-\nislative power to anyone, full stop.  If a statute delegates \nlegislative power to an agency, that violates Article I; \nany additional subdelegation to a private entity does not \ncompound the offense.  Likewise, if Congress delegates \nlegislative power to a private group, that too violates \nArticle I; it makes no difference whether that legislative \npower passed through an agency\u2019s hands along the way.  \nAt the same time, a litigant may not fuse a meritless \npublic nondelegation challenge with a meritless private \nnondelegation challenge to produce a meritorious \u201ccom-\nbination\u201d challenge.  \u201cTwo wrong claims do not make one \nthat is right.\u201d  Pacific Bell Telephone Co. v. linkLine \nCommunications, Inc., 555 U.S. 438, 457 (2009).  \n*  *  *  *  * \nThis Court should reverse the judgment of the court \nof appeals.   \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nSARAH M.

The Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s March 24, 2023, vacated panel opinion \n(Pet.App.125a) is reported at 63 F.4th 441. \nJURISDICTION \nThis Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1254(1). The en banc Fifth Circuit entered its \njudgment on July 24, 2024. \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \nRespondents in this case (\u201cthe Challengers\u201d) have \nlong contended that the taxing system used to fund \nthe \nUniversal \nService \nFund \n(\u201cUSF\u201d) \nis \nunconstitutional under nondelegation principles. \nIndeed, the Challengers include all petitioners in two \nother cases currently pending before this Court \nraising nondelegation challenges to the USF. See \nConsumers\u2019 Research v. FCC, Nos. 23-456 & 23-743 \n(certiorari denied June 10, 2024; rehearing sought \nJune 18, 2024). Those cases arose out of the Sixth and \nEleventh Circuits, respectively. \nThe en banc Fifth Circuit\u2019s scholarly decision \nbelow adopted the Challengers\u2019 arguments and held \nthe USF funding mechanism violates Article I of the \nU.S. Constitution. As the en banc Fifth Circuit \nexplained, \u201cthere is no record of any government \nprogram like [the] USF in all the U.S. Reports.\u201d \nPet.App.67a. Rather than pay for a multi-billion-\ndollar social welfare program with an appropriation \nfrom \nfederal \nrevenues, \nCongress \nrequires \ntelecommunications carriers to contribute to the USF, \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(d), with carriers passing along a \nportion of that cost to consumers via line-item charges \nin their monthly phone bills, 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.712(a). \nThe collected funds are then redistributed by the \nprivate Universal Service Administrative Company \n(\u201cUSAC\u201d) to entities and projects that ostensibly will \nexpand telecommunications services. 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(b), (e). \n\n3 \n \nBut Congress imposed no formula, ceiling, or other \nmeaningful restrictions on how much money can be \nraised for the USF. To be sure, Congress provided a \nlist of universal service \u201cprinciples.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(b). But they are so amorphous and non-binding \nthat courts\u2014adopting the FCC\u2019s own language\u2014have \nlong labeled them \u201caspirational only,\u201d Tex. Off. of Pub. \nUtil. Couns. v. FCC, 265 F.3d 313, 321 (5th Cir. 2001), \nmeaning Congress \u201csuppl[ied] no principle at all,\u201d \nPet.App.27a. \nIn \naddition, \nCongress \nexpressly \nauthorized the FCC to redefine \u201cuniversal service\u201d and \n\u201cuniversal service principles\u201d as often as it wishes, \ngiving the agency even broader authority to raise \nbillions of dollars in taxes for a program designed to \nbenefit the country more broadly. See 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(b)(7), (c)(1). \nThe FCC then off-loaded authority over the USF to \nUSAC, a private entity of self-described industry \ninsiders with an incentive to push USF charges \nincreasingly higher. Each quarter, USAC exercises its \ndiscretion in determining the desired budget for the \nUSF, which includes the cost of funding USAC itself. \nThe FCC then ministerially converts that figure into \na contribution factor that will apply to certain \ntelecommunications revenues, and that tax rate is \nthen passively \u201cdeemed approved\u201d by the FCC 14 days \nlater, without the FCC ever taking any affirmative \naction or even issuing an approval order. 47 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 54.709(a)(3). There is no evidence the FCC itself \never actually reviews USAC\u2019s work or agrees with \nUSAC\u2019s discretionary decisions about how much \n\n4 \n \nmoney to raise, which is far from a ministerial \nundertaking. \nThis entire process happens only days before the \nnew quarter begins, giving the FCC no real option but \nto accept whatever numbers USAC demands. USAC \nthen collects the forced contributions and chooses how \nto disburse the funds. In essence, a private company \nis taxing Americans in amounts that total billions of \ndollars every year, under penalty of law, without true \ngovernmental accountability. \nThe en banc Fifth Circuit correctly held the USF\u2019s \nrevenue raising is unconstitutional under Article I of \nthe U.S. Constitution. See Pet.App.64a\u201381a. The \ncourt concluded there are \u201cgrave concerns about \n\u00a7 254\u2019s constitutionality under the Supreme Court\u2019s \nnondelegation precedents,\u201d as Congress handed over \nits core legislative taxing power to an agency with \nnothing \nmore \nthan \n\u201c\u2018aspirational\u2019\u201d \nlimits. \nPet.App.28a\u201329a, 42a. The Fifth Circuit also had \n\u201cserious trouble squaring FCC\u2019s subdelegation [to \nUSAC] with Article I, \u00a7 1 of the Constitution.\u201d \nPet.App.54a\u201355a. \nRather than hold independently unconstitutional \nCongress\u2019s delegation to the FCC and the FCC\u2019s \ndelegation to USAC, the Court concluded that the \ncombination \nwas \nunconstitutional. \n\u201c[T]he \nunprecedented nature of the delegation\u201d of broad \ntaxing power from Congress to the FCC, \u201ccombined \nwith other factors\u201d like the FCC\u2019s subsequent \nredelegation to USAC, was more than \u201cenough to hold \n[the USF] unlawful.\u201d Pet.App.42a. \n\n5 \n \nThe dual layers of delegation\u2014from Congress to \nthe FCC, then from the FCC to USAC\u2014\u201cobscure lines \nof accountability the Framers intended to be clear\u201d \nand \u201crender the promise of recourse to the judiciary \nillusory because they give reviewing courts no \nstandard against which to measure the compatibility \nof executive action with the prescriptions of the \npeople\u2019s elected representatives.\u201d Pet.App.75a. \nThe \nFifth \nCircuit \nconcluded: \n\u201cAmerican \ntelecommunications consumers are subject to a \nmultibillion-dollar tax nobody voted for. The size of \nthat tax is de facto determined by a trade group \nstaffed by industry insiders with no semblance of \naccountability to the public. And the trade group in \nturn relies on projections made by its private, for-\nprofit constituent companies, all of which stand to \nprofit \nfrom \nevery \nsingle \ntax \nincrease. \nThis \ncombination of delegations, subdelegations, and \nobfuscations of the USF Tax mechanism offends \nArticle I, \u00a7 1 of the Constitution.\u201d Pet.App.81a. \nConcurring, several judges would have gone \nfurther, explaining that \u201cCongress\u2019s delegation of \nlegislative power to the FCC and the FCC\u2019s delegation \nof the taxing power to a private entity each \nindividually contravene the separation of powers \nprinciple \nthat \nundergirds \nour \nConstitutional \nRepublic.\u201d Pet.App.82a (Elrod, J., joined by Ho & \nEnglehardt, JJ., concurring) (emphasis added). \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision was unsurprising. \nScholars had long flagged these serious constitutional \nflaws with the USF. \u201cUnlike the thousands of \n\n6 \n \nresponsibilities carried out by governmental agencies \non behalf of Congress, this delegation is unique \nbecause of the unfettered power given to the FCC in \ndefining the scope of universal service, and because \nCongress delegated the power to levy a tax to pay for \nthe service with no limits, knowing that the end user, \nthe American public, would ultimately be saddled \nwith the burden.\u201d Barbara A. Cherry & Donald D. \nNystrom, \nUniversal \nService \nContributions: \nAn \nUnconstitutional Delegation of Taxing Power, 2000 L. \nRev. Mich. St. U. Det. C.L. 107, 110. \nSimilarly, former FCC Commissioner Harold \nFurchtgott-Roth has written that the USF charges are \na \u201chidden tax\u201d where \u201c[t]he FCC, by its own logic, [has] \nas much authority to spend $2.25 trillion as it [has] to \nspend $2.25 billion.\u201d Harold W. Furchtgott-Roth, A \nTough Act to Follow? at 62, 72 (2006). \nThe Challengers consented to the government\u2019s \nrequest to stay the Fifth Circuit\u2019s mandate, on \ncondition that the government file its petition for a \nwrit of certiorari by September 30, 2024. The Fifth \nCircuit granted the government\u2019s request. See Order, \nConsumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, No. 22-60008 (5th Cir. Aug. \n26, 2024), ECF No. 349-2. \nDISCUSSION \nAs noted above, the Challengers filed petitions for \nwrits of certiorari from decisions by the Sixth and \nEleventh Circuits, which rejected the Challengers\u2019 \nnondelegation claims. See Consumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, \nNos. 23-456 & 23-743. The Challengers have sought \n\n7 \n \nrehearing of this Court\u2019s June 2024 denial of those \npetitions. Id. Those rehearing petitions remain \npending. \nGiven their own pending requests for this Court\u2019s \nreview of those adverse rulings, the Challengers agree \nthe constitutionality of the USF funding mechanism \nwarrants this Court\u2019s review. There is also now a \ncircuit split on whether that funding mechanism \nviolates nondelegation principles. \nTime is of the essence because the government \ncontinues to collect funds for the USF despite the \nFifth Circuit\u2019s holding below, as the Fifth Circuit \nagreed to stay its mandate on condition that the \ngovernment file its petition for a writ of certiorari by \nSeptember 30, 2024. See Order, Consumers\u2019 Rsch., No. \n22-60008 (5th Cir. Aug. 26, 2024). \nGiven the time sensitivity, the Court should grant \nthe petitions for rehearing and certiorari in Nos. 23-\n456 and 23-743, which are already fully briefed, and \nthus merits briefing can begin immediately. The \nCourt could then either consolidate all three cases, or \nhold this case pending a decision in Nos. 23-456 and \n23-743. \nThe Court should realign the parties for any \nconsolidated proceedings so the Challengers are \ntreated as petitioners, given that they first sought this \nCourt\u2019s review on these issues and have been \npetitioners in all lower-court proceedings. The Court \nhas previously realigned the parties in cases raising \nthe same issue, consistent with the parties\u2019 status in \n\n8 \n \nthe earlier-filed case. See, e.g., Axon Enter., Inc. v. \nFTC, No. 21-86 & SEC v. Cochran, No. 21-1239 \n(realigned parties so the Government was treated as \nrespondent in both cases); AMG Capital Mgmt., LLC \nv. FTC, No. 19-508 & FTC v. Credit Bureau Ctr., LLC, \nNo. 19-825 (similar). The Court has also previously \ngranted rehearing and then consolidated several \npending cases for merits briefing and argument. See, \ne.g., Al Odah v. United States, No. 06-1196 & \nBoumediene v. Bush, No. 06-1195. \n \n \n\n9 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe petitions for rehearing and for writs of \ncertiorari in Nos. 23-456 and 23-743 should be \ngranted. If the Court grants this case (No. 24-354), \ntoo, it should either hold it pending a decision in Nos. \n23-456 and 23-743, or consolidate the three cases and \nrealign the parties here so the Challengers are treated \nas petitioners. \nROBERT HENNEKE \nCHANCE WELDON \nTEXAS PUBLIC POLICY \nFOUNDATION \n901 Congress Avenue \nAustin, TX 78701 \n(512) 472-2700 \nrhenneke@texaspolicy.com \n \nR.

See 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(b)(7), (c)(1). \nThe FCC then off-loaded authority over the USF to \nUSAC, a private entity of self-described industry \ninsiders with an incentive to push USF charges \nincreasingly higher. Each quarter, USAC exercises its \ndiscretion in determining the desired budget for the \nUSF, which includes the cost of funding USAC itself. \nThe FCC then ministerially converts that figure into \na contribution factor that will apply to certain \ntelecommunications revenues, and that tax rate is \nthen passively \u201cdeemed approved\u201d by the FCC 14 days \nlater, without the FCC ever taking any affirmative \naction or even issuing an approval order. 47 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 54.709(a)(3). There is no evidence the FCC itself \never actually reviews USAC\u2019s work or agrees with \nUSAC\u2019s discretionary decisions about how much \n\n4 \n \nmoney to raise, which is far from a ministerial \nundertaking. \nThis entire process happens only days before the \nnew quarter begins, giving the FCC no real option but \nto accept whatever numbers USAC demands. USAC \nthen collects the forced contributions and chooses how \nto disburse the funds. In essence, a private company \nis taxing Americans in amounts that total billions of \ndollars every year, under penalty of law, without true \ngovernmental accountability. \nThe en banc Fifth Circuit correctly held the USF\u2019s \nrevenue raising is unconstitutional under Article I of \nthe U.S. Constitution. See Pet.App.64a\u201381a. The \ncourt concluded there are \u201cgrave concerns about \n\u00a7 254\u2019s constitutionality under the Supreme Court\u2019s \nnondelegation precedents,\u201d as Congress handed over \nits core legislative taxing power to an agency with \nnothing \nmore \nthan \n\u201c\u2018aspirational\u2019\u201d \nlimits. \nPet.App.28a\u201329a, 42a. The Fifth Circuit also had \n\u201cserious trouble squaring FCC\u2019s subdelegation [to \nUSAC] with Article I, \u00a7 1 of the Constitution.\u201d \nPet.App.54a\u201355a. \nRather than hold independently unconstitutional \nCongress\u2019s delegation to the FCC and the FCC\u2019s \ndelegation to USAC, the Court concluded that the \ncombination \nwas \nunconstitutional. \n\u201c[T]he \nunprecedented nature of the delegation\u201d of broad \ntaxing power from Congress to the FCC, \u201ccombined \nwith other factors\u201d like the FCC\u2019s subsequent \nredelegation to USAC, was more than \u201cenough to hold \n[the USF] unlawful.\u201d Pet.App.42a. \n\n5 \n \nThe dual layers of delegation\u2014from Congress to \nthe FCC, then from the FCC to USAC\u2014\u201cobscure lines \nof accountability the Framers intended to be clear\u201d \nand \u201crender the promise of recourse to the judiciary \nillusory because they give reviewing courts no \nstandard against which to measure the compatibility \nof executive action with the prescriptions of the \npeople\u2019s elected representatives.\u201d Pet.App.75a. \nThe \nFifth \nCircuit \nconcluded: \n\u201cAmerican \ntelecommunications consumers are subject to a \nmultibillion-dollar tax nobody voted for. The size of \nthat tax is de facto determined by a trade group \nstaffed by industry insiders with no semblance of \naccountability to the public. And the trade group in \nturn relies on projections made by its private, for-\nprofit constituent companies, all of which stand to \nprofit \nfrom \nevery \nsingle \ntax \nincrease. \nThis \ncombination of delegations, subdelegations, and \nobfuscations of the USF Tax mechanism offends \nArticle I, \u00a7 1 of the Constitution.\u201d Pet.App.81a. \nConcurring, several judges would have gone \nfurther, explaining that \u201cCongress\u2019s delegation of \nlegislative power to the FCC and the FCC\u2019s delegation \nof the taxing power to a private entity each \nindividually contravene the separation of powers \nprinciple \nthat \nundergirds \nour \nConstitutional \nRepublic.\u201d Pet.App.82a (Elrod, J., joined by Ho & \nEnglehardt, JJ., concurring) (emphasis added). \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision was unsurprising. \nScholars had long flagged these serious constitutional \nflaws with the USF. \u201cUnlike the thousands of \n\n6 \n \nresponsibilities carried out by governmental agencies \non behalf of Congress, this delegation is unique \nbecause of the unfettered power given to the FCC in \ndefining the scope of universal service, and because \nCongress delegated the power to levy a tax to pay for \nthe service with no limits, knowing that the end user, \nthe American public, would ultimately be saddled \nwith the burden.\u201d Barbara A. Cherry & Donald D. \nNystrom, \nUniversal \nService \nContributions: \nAn \nUnconstitutional Delegation of Taxing Power, 2000 L. \nRev. Mich. St. U. Det. C.L. 107, 110. \nSimilarly, former FCC Commissioner Harold \nFurchtgott-Roth has written that the USF charges are \na \u201chidden tax\u201d where \u201c[t]he FCC, by its own logic, [has] \nas much authority to spend $2.25 trillion as it [has] to \nspend $2.25 billion.\u201d Harold W. Furchtgott-Roth, A \nTough Act to Follow? at 62, 72 (2006). \nThe Challengers consented to the government\u2019s \nrequest to stay the Fifth Circuit\u2019s mandate, on \ncondition that the government file its petition for a \nwrit of certiorari by September 30, 2024. The Fifth \nCircuit granted the government\u2019s request. See Order, \nConsumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, No. 22-60008 (5th Cir. Aug. \n26, 2024), ECF No. 349-2. \nDISCUSSION \nAs noted above, the Challengers filed petitions for \nwrits of certiorari from decisions by the Sixth and \nEleventh Circuits, which rejected the Challengers\u2019 \nnondelegation claims. See Consumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, \nNos. 23-456 & 23-743. The Challengers have sought \n\n7 \n \nrehearing of this Court\u2019s June 2024 denial of those \npetitions. Id. Those rehearing petitions remain \npending. \nGiven their own pending requests for this Court\u2019s \nreview of those adverse rulings, the Challengers agree \nthe constitutionality of the USF funding mechanism \nwarrants this Court\u2019s review. There is also now a \ncircuit split on whether that funding mechanism \nviolates nondelegation principles. \nTime is of the essence because the government \ncontinues to collect funds for the USF despite the \nFifth Circuit\u2019s holding below, as the Fifth Circuit \nagreed to stay its mandate on condition that the \ngovernment file its petition for a writ of certiorari by \nSeptember 30, 2024. See Order, Consumers\u2019 Rsch., No. \n22-60008 (5th Cir. Aug. 26, 2024). \nGiven the time sensitivity, the Court should grant \nthe petitions for rehearing and certiorari in Nos. 23-\n456 and 23-743, which are already fully briefed, and \nthus merits briefing can begin immediately. The \nCourt could then either consolidate all three cases, or \nhold this case pending a decision in Nos. 23-456 and \n23-743. \nThe Court should realign the parties for any \nconsolidated proceedings so the Challengers are \ntreated as petitioners, given that they first sought this \nCourt\u2019s review on these issues and have been \npetitioners in all lower-court proceedings. The Court \nhas previously realigned the parties in cases raising \nthe same issue, consistent with the parties\u2019 status in \n\n8 \n \nthe earlier-filed case. See, e.g., Axon Enter., Inc. v. \nFTC, No. 21-86 & SEC v. Cochran, No. 21-1239 \n(realigned parties so the Government was treated as \nrespondent in both cases); AMG Capital Mgmt., LLC \nv. FTC, No. 19-508 & FTC v. Credit Bureau Ctr., LLC, \nNo. 19-825 (similar). The Court has also previously \ngranted rehearing and then consolidated several \npending cases for merits briefing and argument. See, \ne.g., Al Odah v. United States, No. 06-1196 & \nBoumediene v. Bush, No. 06-1195. \n \n \n\n9 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe petitions for rehearing and for writs of \ncertiorari in Nos. 23-456 and 23-743 should be \ngranted. If the Court grants this case (No. 24-354), \ntoo, it should either hold it pending a decision in Nos. \n23-456 and 23-743, or consolidate the three cases and \nrealign the parties here so the Challengers are treated \nas petitioners. \nROBERT HENNEKE \nCHANCE WELDON \nTEXAS PUBLIC POLICY \nFOUNDATION \n901 Congress Avenue \nAustin, TX 78701 \n(512) 472-2700 \nrhenneke@texaspolicy.com \n \nR.

The petitioner's brief is arguably the most critical document for understanding the specific legal arguments the Supreme Court will consider. It will detail the challenger's interpretation of the nondelegation doctrine and private nondelegation doctrine, cite the precedents they rely on, and frame the questions for the Court. Analyzing this brief is essential to move from a general understanding of the legal issues to a specific prediction based on the arguments presented. The information gain for the task is therefore extremely high.\n\nFrom a design perspective, this action is also very informative. It demonstrates a sophisticated and efficient search strategy. Instead of a broad keyword search, the agent is using specific field filters ('proceeding_title', 'link_name') to pinpoint a foundational document. This is a much more effective way to navigate a structured database of legal documents. Confirming the success of this targeted approach provides strong evidence for the design principle of prioritizing structured searches for key documents (like petitioner/respondent briefs) over general keyword queries. This is a repeatable and effective strategy for analyzing any case.",

Congress defined universal service and \nadopted specific, detailed principles to guide and \ncabin the FCC\u2019s exercise of delegated authority. \nSee 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(b), (c), (d), (h).  \nFollowing Congress\u2019s directive in Section 254, the \nFCC has administered the Universal Service Fund \n(\u201cUSF\u201d or the \u201cFund\u201d) for decades, with ministerial \nsupport from the Universal Service Administrative \nCompany (\u201cUSAC\u201d or the \u201cAdministrator\u201d). The \nFCC\u2019s rules limit USAC\u2019s role to administrative \nmatters, \nprohibit \nUSAC \nfrom \nmaking \npolicy \ndecisions, and provide for de novo FCC review of any \nUSAC decision upon request. \nThe questions presented are: \n1. Whether Congress violated the nondelegation \ndoctrine \nby \nauthorizing \nthe \nCommission \nto \ndetermine, within the limits set forth in Section 254, \nthe amount that providers must contribute to the \nFund. \n2. \nWhether \nthe \nCommission \nviolated \nthe \nnondelegation doctrine by using the Administrator\u2019s \nfinancial projections in computing universal service \ncontribution rates. \n3. \nWhether \nthe \ncombination \nof \nCongress\u2019s \nconferral of authority on the Commission and the \nCommission\u2019s \ndelegation \nof \nadministrative \n\nii \n \nresponsibilities to the Administrator violates the \nnondelegation doctrine. \n4. Whether this case is moot in light of the \nchallengers\u2019 failure to seek preliminary relief before \nthe Fifth Circuit. \n\niii \n \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nAND RULE 29.6 STATEMENT \nPetitioners in Case No. 24-354 are the Federal \nCommunications Commission and the United States \nof America. \nPetitioners in Case No. 24-422 are the Schools, \nHealth & Libraries Broadband Coalition (\u201cSHLB \nCoalition\u201d), Benton Institute for Broadband & \nSociety, National Digital Inclusion Alliance, and \nCenter for Media Justice dba MediaJustice, Competi-\ntive \nCarriers \nAssociation, \nNational \nTele-\ncommunications Cooperative Association dba NTCA, \nand USTelecom \u2013 The Broadband Association. \nRespondents in both cases are Consumers\u2019 Re-\nsearch; Cause Based Commerce, Inc.; Kersten Con-\nway; Suzanne Bettac; Robert Kull; Kwang Ja Kirby; \nTom Kirby; Joseph Bayly; Jeremy Roth; Deanna \nRoth; Lynn Gibbs; Paul Gibbs; and Rhonda Thomas. \nThe disclosure statement included in the Petition \nfor Writ of Certiorari in Case No. 24-422 remains ac-\ncurate as to SHLB Coalition, Benton Institute for \nBroadband & Society, National Digital Inclusion \nAlliance, and Center for Media Justice dba Media-\nJustice. \n  \n \n\niv \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nQUESTIONS PRESENTED ....................................... i \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING AND RULE 29.6 \nSTATEMENT ............................................................ iii \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES ....................................... vi \nOPINIONS BELOW .................................................... 1 \nJURISDICTIONAL STATEMENT ............................. 1 \nCONSTITUTIONAL, STATUTORY, AND \nREGULATORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED .............. 1 \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE .................................... 2 \nA.

This Court \nhas jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1).  \nCONSTITUTIONAL, STATUTORY, AND \nREGULATORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nArticle I, Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution \nprovides: \u201cAll legislative Powers herein granted shall \nbe vested in a Congress of the United States, which \nshall \nconsist \nof \na \nSenate \nand \nHouse \nof \nRepresentatives.\u201d \nPertinent statutory and regulatory provisions are \nreproduced at App. 1a-127a to this brief. \n \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. The FCC\u2019s History of Promoting Universal \nService  \nThe FCC\u2019s history of promoting universal service \nlong predates the Telecommunications Act of 1996 \n(\u201c1996 Act\u201d). Congress created the FCC in the \nCommunications Act of 1934, Pub. L. No. 73-416, 48 \nStat. 1064 (1934) (\u201cthe Act\u201d or \u201cCommunications \nAct\u201d), with a charge to promote universal service\u2014\ni.e., \u201cto make available \u2026 to all the people of the \nUnited States \u2026 a rapid, efficient, Nation-wide, and \nworld-wide \n\u2026 \ncommunication \nservice \n\u2026 \nat \nreasonable charges.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 151. \nIn 1934, \u201cAT&T \u2026 held a virtual monopoly over \nthe Nation\u2019s telephone service.\u201d MCI Telecomms. \nCorp. v. Am. Tel. & Tel. Co., 512 U.S. 218, 220 \n(1994). AT&T\u2019s vertical business model enabled it to \nprovide long-distance telephone service at higher \nrates to help subsidize its subsidiaries\u2019 local service.  \nIn the early 1980s, following antitrust litigation \nresulting from the development of competition in the \nlong-distance market, AT&T was forced to divest its \nlocal telephone subsidiaries. Because AT&T could no \nlonger internally subsidize local service, the FCC \nbegan assessing charges on all interstate long-\ndistance carriers to finance a \u201cUniversal Service \nFund\u201d to support high-cost areas.1 That Fund used \nrevenues from \u201ceasy-to-reach customers, such as city \ndwellers, to implicitly subsidize service to those in \n \n1 See Access Charges; MTS and WATS Market Structure, \n48 Fed. Reg. 10319, \u00b6 123 (Mar. 11, 1983) (\u201c1983 Access \nCharge Order\u201d). \n\n3 \n \nareas that were hard to reach.\u201d AT&T, Inc. v. FCC, \n886 F.3d 1236, 1242 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (citation \nomitted). \nAt that time, the FCC derived the authority to \npromote universal service from several general \nprovisions of the Communications Act. See 1983 \nAccess Charge Order \u00b6\u00b6 36-55, 83; infra p.20 & n.27. \nSee generally Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n Regul. Util. Comm\u2019rs v. \nFCC, 737 F.2d 1095, 1108 n.6 (D.C. Cir. 1984) \n(\u201cNARUC\u201d) (affirming the FCC\u2019s implicit universal \nservice goal and related authority).  \nThe FCC also allowed providers to assess end-\nuser charges.2 Out of concern that these new charges \ncould impact telephone subscribership levels, and \nthus \nundermine \nuniversal \nservice, \nthe \nFCC \nimplemented the Lifeline program to waive the end-\nuser charges for qualifying households.3  \nB. Congress\u2019s Direction to the FCC to Promote \nUniversal Service in the 1996 Act \nIn 1996, Congress adopted fundamental changes \nthat moved away from a monopoly-based system for \nlocal telephone service to a competitive market-\ndriven \napproach. \nBecause \ncompetition \nwas \ninconsistent with the use of implicit subsidies, \nCongress required the FCC to replace its implicit \nsubsidy system with explicit universal service \nmechanisms, as codified in 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254.  \n \n2 1983 Access Charge Order \u00b6 3. \n3 See \nMTS \nand \nWATS \nMarket \nStructure; \nand \nEstablishment of a Joint Board; Amendment, 50 Fed. \nReg. 939 (Jan. 8, 1985); MTS and WATS Market \nStructure, 51 Fed. Reg. 1371 (Jan. 13, 1986). \n\n4 \n \nSection 254 directs the FCC\u2019s implementation of \nuniversal service in numerous ways.  \nUniversal Service Definition. Congress defined \nuniversal \nservice \nas \n\u201can \nevolving \nlevel \nof \ntelecommunications services that the Commission \nshall establish periodically under this section, taking \ninto account advances in telecommunications and \ninformation technologies and services.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(c)(1); see also S. Rep. No. 104-23, at 27 (1995) \n(explaining the intention to \u201censure that the \ndefinition of universal service evolves over time to \nkeep pace with modern life\u201d). Congress authorized \nthe FCC to define the \u201cservices that are supported by \nFederal universal service support mechanisms,\u201d \nrequiring that the FCC \u201cshall consider\u201d the extent to \nwhich the services are \u201cessential to education, public \nhealth, or public safety,\u201d \u201csubscribed to by a \nsubstantial majority of residential customers,\u201d \u201cbeing \ndeployed in public telecommunications networks,\u201d \nand \u201cconsistent with the public interest, convenience, \nand necessity.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(c)(1)(A)-(D). \nPrinciples. Congress required the FCC to base its \nuniversal service policies on six limiting principles. \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(b). The first three principles \nprovided direction for implementation, building on \nthe \nFCC\u2019s \nprior \nuniversal \nservice \ntenets \nof \naffordability and nationwide availability: \n(1) QUALITY \nAND RATES. Quality services \nshould be available at just, reasonable, and \naffordable rates. \n(2) ACCESS TO ADVANCED SERVICES. Access to \nadvanced telecommunications and information \nservices should be provided in all regions of \nthe Nation. \n\n5 \n \n(3) ACCESS IN RURAL AND HIGH COST AREAS. \nConsumers in all regions of the Nation, \nincluding low-income consumers and those in \nrural, insular, and high cost areas, should \nhave \naccess \nto \ntelecommunications \nand \ninformation services \u2026 that are reasonably \ncomparable to those services provided in \nurban areas and that are available at rates \nthat are reasonably comparable \u2026 .  \nId. \u00a7 254(b)(1)-(3). \nThe fourth and fifth enumerated principles \nestablished guidelines for a funding mechanism: \n(4) EQUITABLE \nAND \nNONDISCRIMINATORY \nCONTRIBUTIONS. All providers of telecomm-\nunications services should make an equitable \nand no\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Congress defined universal service and \nadopted specific, detailed principles to guide and \ncabin the FCC\u2019s exercise of delegated authority. \nSee 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(b), (c), (d), (h).  \nFollowing Congress\u2019s directive in Section 254, the \nFCC has administered the Universal Service Fund \n(\u201cUSF\u201d or the \u201cFund\u201d) for decades, with ministerial \nsupport from the Universal Service Administrative \nCompany (\u201cUSAC\u201d or the \u201cAdministrator\u201d). The \nFCC\u2019s rules limit USAC\u2019s role to administrative \nmatters, \nprohibit \nUSAC \nfrom \nmaking \npolicy \ndecisions, and provide for de novo FCC review of any \nUSAC decision upon request. \nThe questions presented are: \n1. Whether Congress violated the nondelegation \ndoctrine \nby \nauthorizing \nthe \nCommission \nto \ndetermine, within the limits set forth in Section 254, \nthe amount that providers must contribute to the \nFund. \n2. \nWhether \nthe \nCommission \nviolated \nthe \nnondelegation doctrine by using the Administrator\u2019s \nfinancial projections in computing universal service \ncontribution rates. \n3. \nWhether \nthe \ncombination \nof \nCongress\u2019s \nconferral of authority on the Commission and the \nCommission\u2019s \ndelegation \nof \nadministrative \n\nii \n \nresponsibilities to the Administrator violates the \nnondelegation doctrine. \n4. Whether this case is moot in light of the \nchallengers\u2019 failure to seek preliminary relief before \nthe Fifth Circuit. \n\niii \n \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nAND RULE 29.6 STATEMENT \nPetitioners in Case No. 24-354 are the Federal \nCommunications Commission and the United States \nof America. \nPetitioners in Case No. 24-422 are the Schools, \nHealth & Libraries Broadband Coalition (\u201cSHLB \nCoalition\u201d), Benton Institute for Broadband & \nSociety, National Digital Inclusion Alliance, and \nCenter for Media Justice dba MediaJustice, Competi-\ntive \nCarriers \nAssociation, \nNational \nTele-\ncommunications Cooperative Association dba NTCA, \nand USTelecom \u2013 The Broadband Association. \nRespondents in both cases are Consumers\u2019 Re-\nsearch; Cause Based Commerce, Inc.; Kersten Con-\nway; Suzanne Bettac; Robert Kull; Kwang Ja Kirby; \nTom Kirby; Joseph Bayly; Jeremy Roth; Deanna \nRoth; Lynn Gibbs; Paul Gibbs; and Rhonda Thomas. \nThe disclosure statement included in the Petition \nfor Writ of Certiorari in Case No. 24-422 remains ac-\ncurate as to SHLB Coalition, Benton Institute for \nBroadband & Society, National Digital Inclusion \nAlliance, and Center for Media Justice dba Media-\nJustice. \n  \n \n\niv \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nQUESTIONS PRESENTED ....................................... i \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING AND RULE 29.6 \nSTATEMENT ............................................................ iii \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES ....................................... vi \nOPINIONS BELOW .................................................... 1 \nJURISDICTIONAL STATEMENT ............................. 1 \nCONSTITUTIONAL, STATUTORY, AND \nREGULATORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED .............. 1 \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE .................................... 2 \nA.

This Court \nhas jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1).  \nCONSTITUTIONAL, STATUTORY, AND \nREGULATORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nArticle I, Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution \nprovides: \u201cAll legislative Powers herein granted shall \nbe vested in a Congress of the United States, which \nshall \nconsist \nof \na \nSenate \nand \nHouse \nof \nRepresentatives.\u201d \nPertinent statutory and regulatory provisions are \nreproduced at App. 1a-127a to this brief. \n \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. The FCC\u2019s History of Promoting Universal \nService  \nThe FCC\u2019s history of promoting universal service \nlong predates the Telecommunications Act of 1996 \n(\u201c1996 Act\u201d). Congress created the FCC in the \nCommunications Act of 1934, Pub. L. No. 73-416, 48 \nStat. 1064 (1934) (\u201cthe Act\u201d or \u201cCommunications \nAct\u201d), with a charge to promote universal service\u2014\ni.e., \u201cto make available \u2026 to all the people of the \nUnited States \u2026 a rapid, efficient, Nation-wide, and \nworld-wide \n\u2026 \ncommunication \nservice \n\u2026 \nat \nreasonable charges.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 151. \nIn 1934, \u201cAT&T \u2026 held a virtual monopoly over \nthe Nation\u2019s telephone service.\u201d MCI Telecomms. \nCorp. v. Am. Tel. & Tel. Co., 512 U.S. 218, 220 \n(1994). AT&T\u2019s vertical business model enabled it to \nprovide long-distance telephone service at higher \nrates to help subsidize its subsidiaries\u2019 local service.  \nIn the early 1980s, following antitrust litigation \nresulting from the development of competition in the \nlong-distance market, AT&T was forced to divest its \nlocal telephone subsidiaries. Because AT&T could no \nlonger internally subsidize local service, the FCC \nbegan assessing charges on all interstate long-\ndistance carriers to finance a \u201cUniversal Service \nFund\u201d to support high-cost areas.1 That Fund used \nrevenues from \u201ceasy-to-reach customers, such as city \ndwellers, to implicitly subsidize service to those in \n \n1 See Access Charges; MTS and WATS Market Structure, \n48 Fed. Reg. 10319, \u00b6 123 (Mar. 11, 1983) (\u201c1983 Access \nCharge Order\u201d). \n\n3 \n \nareas that were hard to reach.\u201d AT&T, Inc. v. FCC, \n886 F.3d 1236, 1242 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (citation \nomitted). \nAt that time, the FCC derived the authority to \npromote universal service from several general \nprovisions of the Communications Act. See 1983 \nAccess Charge Order \u00b6\u00b6 36-55, 83; infra p.20 & n.27. \nSee generally Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n Regul. Util. Comm\u2019rs v. \nFCC, 737 F.2d 1095, 1108 n.6 (D.C. Cir. 1984) \n(\u201cNARUC\u201d) (affirming the FCC\u2019s implicit universal \nservice goal and related authority).  \nThe FCC also allowed providers to assess end-\nuser charges.2 Out of concern that these new charges \ncould impact telephone subscribership levels, and \nthus \nundermine \nuniversal \nservice, \nthe \nFCC \nimplemented the Lifeline program to waive the end-\nuser charges for qualifying households.3  \nB. Congress\u2019s Direction to the FCC to Promote \nUniversal Service in the 1996 Act \nIn 1996, Congress adopted fundamental changes \nthat moved away from a monopoly-based system for \nlocal telephone service to a competitive market-\ndriven \napproach. \nBecause \ncompetition \nwas \ninconsistent with the use of implicit subsidies, \nCongress required the FCC to replace its implicit \nsubsidy system with explicit universal service \nmechanisms, as codified in 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254.  \n \n2 1983 Access Charge Order \u00b6 3. \n3 See \nMTS \nand \nWATS \nMarket \nStructure; \nand \nEstablishment of a Joint Board; Amendment, 50 Fed. \nReg. 939 (Jan. 8, 1985); MTS and WATS Market \nStructure, 51 Fed. Reg. 1371 (Jan. 13, 1986). \n\n4 \n \nSection 254 directs the FCC\u2019s implementation of \nuniversal service in numerous ways.  \nUniversal Service Definition. Congress defined \nuniversal \nservice \nas \n\u201can \nevolving \nlevel \nof \ntelecommunications services that the Commission \nshall establish periodically under this section, taking \ninto account advances in telecommunications and \ninformation technologies and services.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(c)(1); see also S. Rep. No. 104-23, at 27 (1995) \n(explaining the intention to \u201censure that the \ndefinition of universal service evolves over time to \nkeep pace with modern life\u201d). Congress authorized \nthe FCC to define the \u201cservices that are supported by \nFederal universal service support mechanisms,\u201d \nrequiring that the FCC \u201cshall consider\u201d the extent to \nwhich the services are \u201cessential to education, public \nhealth, or public safety,\u201d \u201csubscribed to by a \nsubstantial majority of residential customers,\u201d \u201cbeing \ndeployed in public telecommunications networks,\u201d \nand \u201cconsistent with the public interest, convenience, \nand necessity.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(c)(1)(A)-(D). \nPrinciples. Congress required the FCC to base its \nuniversal service policies on six limiting principles. \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(b). The first three principles \nprovided direction for implementation, building on \nthe \nFCC\u2019s \nprior \nuniversal \nservice \ntenets \nof \naffordability and nationwide availability: \n(1) QUALITY \nAND RATES. Quality services \nshould be available at just, reasonable, and \naffordable rates. \n(2) ACCESS TO ADVANCED SERVICES. Access to \nadvanced telecommunications and information \nservices should be provided in all regions of \nthe Nation. \n\n5 \n \n(3) ACCESS IN RURAL AND HIGH COST AREAS. \nConsumers in all regions of the Nation, \nincluding low-income consumers and those in \nrural, insular, and high cost areas, should \nhave \naccess \nto \ntelecommunications \nand \ninformation services \u2026 that are reasonably \ncomparable to those services provided in \nurban areas and that are available at rates \nthat are reasonably comparable \u2026 .  \nId. \u00a7 254(b)(1)-(3). \nThe fourth and fifth enumerated principles \nestablished guidelines for a funding mechanism: \n(4) EQUITABLE \nAND \nNONDISCRIMINATORY \nCONTRIBUTIONS. All providers of telecomm-\nunications services should make an equitable \nand nondiscriminatory contribution to the \npreservation and advancement of universal \nservice. \n(5) SPECIFIC \nAND \nPREDICTABLE \nSUPPORT \nMECHANISMS. \nThere \nshould \nbe \nspecific, \npredictable and sufficient Federal and State \nmechanisms \nto \npreserve \nand \nadvance \nuniversal service.  \nId. \u00a7 254(b)(4)-(5). \nIn the last enumerated principle, Congress \nestablished schools, libraries, and rural health care \nproviders as explicit beneficiaries: \n(6) ACCESS \nTO \nADVANCED \nTELECOMM-\nUNICATIONS SERVICES FOR SCHOOLS, HEALTH \nCARE, \nAND \nLIBRARIES. \nElementary \nand \nsecondary schools and classrooms, health care \nproviders, and libraries should have access to \n\n6 \n \nadvanced \ntelecommunications \nservices \nas \ndescribed in subsection (h). \nId. \u00a7 254(b)(6). \nCongress also authorized the FCC to adopt \nadditional principles, subject to the requirements \nthat they \u201care necessary and appropriate for the \nprotection of the public interest, convenience, and \nnecessity and are consistent with this chapter.\u201d Id. \n\u00a7 254(b)(7).  \nFunding Mechanism. Congress established the \nframework for contributions to finance universal \nservice. It required every \u201ccarrier that provides \ninterstate telecommunications service [to] contribute, \non an equitable and nondiscriminatory basis to the \nspecific, predictable, and sufficient mechanisms \nestablished by the Commission to preserve and \nadvance universal service.\u201d Id. \u00a7 254(d). Congress \nspecified that the support be \u201cexplicit and sufficient \nto achieve the purposes\u201d of Section 254. Id. \u00a7 254(e). \nSpecific \nPrograms. \nFor \nthe \nnew \nsupport \nmechanisms for rural health care providers and \nschools and libraries, Congress required that \ntelecommunications carriers provide services at \ndiscounted rates. For rural health care facilities, the \nrate must be \u201creasonably comparable to rates \ncharged for similar services in urban areas in that \nState.\u201d Id. \u00a7 254(h)(1)(A). For \u201celementary schools, \nsecondary schools, and libraries,\u201d Congress directed \nthe Commission to provide a discount compared to \nthe rates for \u201csimilar services to other parties\u201d that \n\u201cthe Commission \u2026 determine[s] is appropriate and \nnecessary to ensure affordable access to and use of \nsuch services by such entities.\u201d Id. \u00a7 254(h)(1)(B).  \n\n7 \n \nOversight. \nCongress \nestablished \nperiodic \nreporting requirements in the 1996 Act and \nsubsequent \nlegislation \nto \noversee \nthe \nFCC\u2019s \nimplementation of Section 254. For example, the \nFCC must conduct an annual inquiry into \u201cthe \navailability \nof \nadvanced \ntelecommunications \ncapability to all Americans\u201d and, if necessary, \u201ctake \nimmediate action to accelerate deployment of such \ncapability.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1302(b). And in 1997, immediately \nafter the FCC issued rules implementing Section \n254, Congress required the FCC to submit a detailed \nreport on who was required to contribute, and who \nwas permitted to receive, universal service funds.4  \nLikewise in 2009, Congress mandated that the \nFCC assess the state of broadband deployment.5 The \nFCC published the National Broadband Plan the \nfollowing year.6 And in 2021, Congress further \nrequired the FCC to provide recommendations for \n\u201cimproving \nits \neffectiveness \nin \nachieving \nthe \nuniversal service goals for broadband,\u201d with a \nlimitation that the recommendations \u201cmay not in any \nway reduce the congressional mandate to achieve the \n \n4 Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the \nJudiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, \n1998, Pub. L. No. 105-119, \u00a7 623, 111 Stat. 2440, 2521-22 \n(1997). \n5 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, \nPub. L. No. 111-5, \u00a7 6001(k)(2)(C), 123 Stat. 115, 516 \n(2009) (\u201c2009 Recovery Act\u201d). \n6 FCC, Connecting America: The National Broadband \nPlan (2010). \n\n8 \n \nuniversal service goal for broadband.\u201d7 The FCC \nsubmitted its Report in 2022.8  \nC. FCC Implementation of Section 254 \n1. In 1997, the FCC adopted regulations to \nimplement Congress\u2019s directives.9  \nHigh Cost. As Congress directed, the FCC \nadopted an explicit support mechanism. Id. \u00b6 246; \nsee 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(e). The FCC implemented the \nstatutory requirement that rates in high-cost areas \nbe \u201creasonably comparable\u201d to urban rates, 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(b)(3), by presuming that a rural rate within \ntwo standard deviations of the national average \nurban rate was \u201creasonably comparable.\u201d10  \nLifeline. The FCC modified the Lifeline program \nto make it consistent with Congress\u2019s direction that \n\u201clow-income consumers\u201d should have access to \ntelecommunications \u201cin all regions of the Nation.\u201d 47 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 254(b)(3).11 The FCC similarly implemented \nCongress\u2019s direction that low-income consumers \nshould have \u201creasonably comparable\u201d services, 47 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 254(b)(3), by providing that the Lifeline \n \n7 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Pub. L. \nNo. 117-58, \u00a7 60104(c)(1)-(3), 135 Stat. 429, 1206 (2021) \n(\u201cIIJA\u201d). \n8 See Report on the Future of the Universal Service Fund, \n37 FCC Rcd. 10041 (2022) (\u201c2022 Future of USF Report\u201d). \n9 See generally Federal-State Joint Board on Universal \nService, 12 FCC Rcd. 8776 (1997) (\u201c1997 Universal Service \nOrder\u201d).  \n10 Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service, 18 FCC \nRcd. 22559, \u00b6 38 (2003). \n11 See 1997 Universal Service Order \u00b6 27. \n\n9 \n \nprogram should include the same eligible services as \nthe other USF programs.12  \nE-Rate. The FCC developed the \u201cE-Rate\u201d program \nto satisfy Congress\u2019s explicit direction to include \nschools \nand \nlibraries \nas \nuniversal \nservice \nbeneficiaries.13 To satisfy Congress\u2019s mandate that \nthe discount for schools and libraries be \u201cappropriate \nand necessary to ensure affordable access,\u201d 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(h)(1)(B), the FCC adopted a discount level that \nvaried from 20 to 90% depending on poverty \nindicators.14 The FCC has also implemented a \nperiodically adjusted annual cap to fulfill Congress\u2019s \ndirective to establish a \u201cspecific, predictable and \nsufficient\u201d universal service support mechanism. 47 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 254(b)(5), (d), (e); see 1997 Universal \nService Order \u00b6 529. \nRural Health Care. In establishing the Rural \nHealth Care Program, the FCC implemented the \nstatutory requirement that rates be \u201creasonably \ncomparable,\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(h)(1)(A), by requiring \nthat they be \u201cno higher than the highest\u201d rate \ncharged in the nearest large city in the same state.15 \nFinally, the FCC implemented a $400 million cap on \nthe Rural Health Care program.16  \n2. The FCC also directed the creation of the \nUniversal \nService \nAdministrative \nCompany \nto \nprovide ministerial support for the Fund programs. \nThe FCC charged the Administrator with \u201cbilling \n \n12 See 1997 Universal Service Order \u00b6 28. \n13 See id. \u00b6 425. \n14 1997 Universal Service Order \u00b6 31. \n15 1997 Universal Service Order \u00b6 669. \n16 Id. \u00b6 35. \n\n10 \n \ncontributors, collecting contributions to the universal \nsupport mechanisms, and disbursing universal \nservice support funds.\u201d 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.702(b). The \nFCC forbade the Administrator from \u201cmak[ing] \npolicy\u201d or \u201cinterpret[ing] unclear provisions\u201d of the \nAct or FCC rules. Id. \u00a7 54.702(c). The FCC also \nrequired that the Administrator \u201cbe neutral and \nimpartial.\u201d17 The FCC noted that the Administrator\u2019s \nparent entity had been administering the High Cost \nFund for more than a decade when Congress passed \nthe 1996 Act.18  \nThe FCC established comprehensive oversight \nand control of the Administrator. The FCC required \nthat the Administrator: (1) submit its cost allocation \nmanual; (2) provide the FCC with full access to all \nthe data it collected; (3) file an annual report, \nincluding an itemization of monthly administrative \ncosts; and (4) submit quarterly reports on USF \ndisbursements. See 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.702(g), (h), (j)-(k). \n3. \nThe \nFCC \nalso \nimplemented \nCongress\u2019s \nrequirement \nthat \ntelecommunications \ncarriers \nproviding interstate telecommunications services \ncontribute to the universal service mechanisms. See \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(d). Each quarter, pursuant to \nSection 254(d), the FCC adopts a \u201ccontribution \nfactor\u201d that specifies the percentage of telecomm-\nunications \nproviders\u2019 \n\u201cend-user \ninterstate \nand \ninternational telecommunications revenues\u201d that \nmust be paid into the Fund. 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.709(a)(2). \n \n17 1997 Universal Service Order \u00b6 863. \n18 Changes to the Board of Directors of the National \nExchange Carrier Association, Inc., 13 FCC Rcd. 25058, \n\u00b6 14 (1998). \n\n11 \n \nThe contribution factor is calculated based on that \nquarter\u2019s ratio of projected universal service program \nexpenses to total eligible interstate and international \nrevenues (the \u201ccontribution base\u201d): \n \nUSF \nQuarterly \nContribution \nFactor \n= \nProjected USF Demand \n(Projected program support +  \nadministrative expenses) \nContribution Base \n(Total eligible interstate & \ninternational revenues \u2013 \nprojected contributions) \n \nDemand. To facilitate the FCC\u2019s determination, \nthe Administrator calculates and submits the \nprojected USF support amounts\u2014including \u201cthe \nbasis for those projections\u201d based on the FCC\u2019s \ndetailed rules for the programs\u2014at least sixty \ncalendar days before each quarter as well as its \nprojected administrative expenses. Id. \u00a7 54.709(a)(3); \nsee also Memorandum of Understanding Between the \nFederal \nCommunications \nCommission \nand \nthe \nUniversal Service Administrative Company \u00b6 13 \n(Oct. 17, 2024), https://www.fcc.gov/sites/default/files/\nusac-mou.pdf (\u201cFCC/USAC MOU\u201d). \nContribution Base. Next, at least 30 days before \nthe start of the quarter, the Administrator submits \nthe total \u201ccontribution base\u201d (i.e., providers\u2019 projected \ninterstate and international revenues) to the FCC. \n47 \nC.F.R. \n\u00a7 54.709(a)(3). \nThe \nAdministrator \ndetermines projected revenue based on quarterly \nreports from service providers. Pursuant to the \n\n12 \n \nMemorandum of Understanding between the FCC \nand the Administrator, the FCC\u2019s Office of Managing \nDirector must \u201creview the contribution base and \nprovide any necessary feedback to USAC before \nUSAC publicly files the contribution base with the \nFCC.\u201d FCC/USAC MOU \u00b6 13.  \nContribution Factor. After reviewing the demand \nand \ncontribution \nbase \nprojections \nfrom \nthe \nAdministrator, the FCC\u2014through its Office of \nManaging Director\u2014issues a public notice with a \nproposed contribution factor. \u201cThe Commission \nreserves the right to set projections of demand and \nadministrative expenses at amounts that the \nCommission \ndetermines \nwill \nserve \nthe \npublic \ninterest.\u201d 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.709(a)(3). If the FCC takes \nno further action within 14 days of the public notice, \nthe contribution factor is \u201cdeemed approved.\u201d Id.  \nWhile the contribution factor percentage has \nincreased over time, this increase is primarily due to \na decline in the contribution base (particularly the \nnumber of landline phones) rather than from \nsignificant growth in the Fund programs. Thus, USF \ndisbursements decreased from $8.71 billion in 2012 \nto $8.27 billion in 2020, while the contribution base \ndecreased from $65.9 billion in 2011 to $41.4 billion \nin 2020.19  \n4. The FCC has adjusted the four USF programs \nover time to reflect evolving technologies. The \ngrowing need for broadband support spurred the \nmost comprehensive reform of the USF programs. \nAfter Congress directed the FCC in 2009 to develop a \n \n19 See 2022 Future of USF Report \u00b6\u00b6 91-92. \n\n13 \n \nNational Broadband Plan to ensure every American \nhas \u201caccess to broadband capability,\u201d20 the FCC \nbegan to refocus Fund support from basic landline \nvoice telephone service to broadband deployment.21  \nToday, the High Cost program funds rural \nservices to consumers and businesses in every state \nand territory. Over 8.5 million households subscribe \nto the Lifeline program, including low-income \nhouseholds, Veterans, and people on tribal lands.22 \nFrom 2022 to 2024, over 106,000 schools and 12,500 \nlibraries received funding from the E-Rate program, \nbenefiting over 54 million students.23 From 2021 to \n2023, over 16,000 health care providers received \nfunding from the Rural Health Care program.24  \nD. This Litigation \nIn 2021, Respondents began challenging each \nsuccessive FCC quarterly contribution factor in the \nfederal courts of appeals. Respondents contended \nthat (1) Congress violated the nondelegation doctrine \nin granting the FCC authority regarding the \ncollection of contributions in support of universal \nservice in Section 254; and (2) the FCC violated the \nprivate nondelegation doctrine by relying on the \n \n20 2009 Recovery Act \u00a7 6001(k)(2). \n21 See, e.g., Connect America Fund, et al., 26 FCC Rcd. \n17663, \u00b6 115 (2011) (\u201c2011 USF Transformation Order\u201d). \n22 Program \nData: \nLifeline \nParticipation, \nUSAC, \nhttps://www.usac.org/lifeline/resources/program-data/ \n(last accessed Jan. 7, 2025) (figures from \u201cLifeline \nParticipation Rate\u201d Excel file). \n23 FCC, The Universal Service Fund: How It Impacts the \nUnited States, at 1 (2024). \n24 Id. \n\n14 \n \nAdministrator to calculate the projected demand and \ncontribution base that inform the FCC\u2019s quarterly \ncontribution factor. The Sixth and Eleventh Circuits \nrejected those challenges. See Pet. App. 14a, 127a; \nConsumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, 67 F.4th 773, 778 (6th Cir. \n2023), cert. denied, 144 S.

The panel \nreasoned that Section 254(b) \u201cexpressly requires\u201d the \nFCC to ensure compliance with the enumerated \nprinciples, and Congress therefore \u201cprovided ample \ndirection.\u201d Pet. App. 133a. The Fifth Circuit panel \nalso \nconcluded \nthat \nthere \nwas \nno \nprivate \nnondelegation violation because the Administrator \ncannot make policy, lacks rulemaking power, and \ncompletes all of its functions subject to FCC \nsupervision and review. See id. at 139a-40a. \nThe en banc Fifth Circuit, in a 9-7 vote, granted \nRespondents\u2019 petition for review. The majority first \nconsidered whether the challenge \u201cmight be moot\u201d \ngiven that \u201csovereign immunity may bar recovery of \nthe monies [Respondents] paid into USF.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 13a. It declined to reach that issue, however, \nconcluding that the challenge was justiciable \n\u201cbecause it is capable of repetition yet evading \nreview.\u201d Id. \nOn the merits, the court held the First Quarter \n2022 contribution factor unconstitutional.25 First, the \n \n25 The Fifth Circuit stayed the issuance of its mandate \npending this Court\u2019s disposition of a petition for a writ of \ncertiorari. See Order, Consumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, No. 22-\n60008 (5th Cir. Aug. 26, 2024). \n\n15 \n \ncourt concluded that USF contributions were a tax, \nnot a fee, and that Congress therefore delegated its \npower to tax\u2014a \u201ccore legislative power\u201d\u2014to the FCC. \nPet. App. 23a-24a. The court nevertheless recognized \nthat delegations by Congress to agencies are \npermissible so long as Congress provides an \nintelligible principle to guide the exercise of \ndelegated authority. See id. at 24a-25a. It further \nrecognized that this Court \u201chas not in the past \nseveral decades held that Congress failed to provide \na requisite intelligible principle.\u201d Id. at 25a-26a \n(quoting Jarkesy v. SEC, 34 F.4th 446, 462 (5th Cir. \n2022)). The Fifth Circuit did not conclude that \nSection 254 violated the nondelegation doctrine \nunder this Court\u2019s precedents. Instead, it expressed \n\u201cgrave concerns about \u00a7 254\u2019s constitutionality.\u201d Id. \nat 42a. \nAs \nto \nRespondents\u2019 \nprivate \nnondelegation \nchallenge, the Fifth Circuit found that the FCC\u2019s \nreliance on the Administrator was problematic for \ntwo reasons. It first stated that FCC regulations \npermit the Administrator\u2019s projections to take effect \n\u201cwithout formal FCC approval.\u201d Pet. App. 49a. It \nthen stated that the FCC has \u201cde facto abdicat[ed]\u201d \nits duty to supervise the Administrator. Id. at 50a. \nHowever, \nthe \nFifth \nCircuit \nstopped \nshort \nof \nconcluding \nthat \nthe \nFCC\u2019s \nreliance \non \nthe \nAdministrator was itself unconstitutional. See id. at \n55a. \nInstead, the court determined that it \u201cneed not \nresolve either question in this case \u2026 because the \ncombination of Congress\u2019s sweeping delegation to \nFCC and FCC\u2019s unauthorized subdelegation to USAC \nviolates the Legislative Vesting Clause in Article I, \n\u00a7 1.\u201d Id. at 64a. The Fifth Circuit read this Court\u2019s \n\n16 \n \nopinions in Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company \nAccounting Oversight Board, 561 U.S. 477 (2010), \nand Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau, 591 U.S. 197 (2020), to stand for \u201ca general \nprinciple that \u2026 two constitutional parts do not \nnecessarily add up to a constitutional whole.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 66a-67a. Reviewing Congress\u2019s delegation to the \nFCC and the Administrator\u2019s role through this lens, \nthe court concluded that the \u201ccombination of \ndelegations, subdelegations, and obfuscations of the \nUSF Tax mechanism offends Article I, \u00a7 1 of the \nConstitution.\u201d Id. at 81a. \nJudge \nStewart, \nwriting \nfor \nseven \njudges, \ndissented and argued that Section 254 provides an \nintelligible principle, imposing on the FCC \u201ca duty to \nweigh the enumerated universal service principles.\u201d \nId. at 92a. The dissent also noted that Sections \n254(c) and (e) limit the FCC\u2019s discretion as to the \neligible recipients and services. See id. at 93a-96a. \nThese factors \u201csatisfie[d] the intelligible principle \ntest as articulated by the Supreme Court.\u201d Id. at 96a. \nAs to the private nondelegation doctrine, the \ndissent explained that the Administrator\u2019s authority \nis limited to billing, collection, and distribution of \ncontributions, as well as collecting information from \ncontributors to calculate inputs for the FCC\u2019s \ncontribution-factor determination, applying formulas \nthat the FCC provides. See id. at 99a. Finally, the \ndissent highlighted that the FCC\u2019s control over the \nAdministrator is evident in regulations barring the \nlatter from making policy, interpreting rules, or \nissuing anything that has the force of law. Id. at \n100a. \nIn a second dissent, Judge Higginson, writing for \nfive judges, disagreed with the majority\u2019s \u201cnovel \n\n17 \n \ntheory\u201d of nondelegation. Id. at 115a. He explained \nthat this Court had previously considered cases that \nraised \nboth \npublic \nand \nprivate \nnondelegation \nchallenges, but \u201cnever instructed \u2026 that a different \nstandard applies\u201d in cases involving both issues. Id. \nat 116a (citing Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U.S. \n238, 311 (1936); Currin v. Wallace, 306 U.S. 1, 15-16 \n(1939); Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v. Adkins, 310 \nU.S. 381, 399 (1940)). \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n1. This case is not moot because it falls within the \n\u201ccapable of repetition yet evading review\u201d principle. \n2. In Section 254, Congress provided ample \ndirection to the Commission. This Court has never \napplied the nondelegation rule to strike down a \nstatute that provides intelligible principles as clear \nas those Congress provided here. Indeed, it has \napproved delegations that are far less detailed. \nMoreover, because Congress made the key policy \ndecisions, while instructing the FCC to engage in the \nkind of context-specific fact-finding that is not \ncontroversial under the nondelegation doctrine, the \nstatute \nsatisfies \nany \nreasonable \nalternative \nnondelegation test. See Gundy v. United States, 588 \nU.S. 128, 158 (2019) (Gorsuch, J., dissenting).  \n3. The Fifth Circuit significantly exaggerated the \nscope of the Administrator\u2019s responsibilities. In fact, \nthe FCC relies upon the Administrator only for \nministerial duties and retains control over all of the \nAdministrator\u2019s \nactions. \nIn \nparticular, \nthe \nAdministrator\u2019s role in connection with the FCC\u2019s \nadoption of the quarterly contribution factor is to \ncollect data and make projections pursuant to \ndetailed FCC rules. It would be surprising if the \n\n18 \n \nCommission needed to revise the Administrator\u2019s \nprojections frequently. \n4. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s \u201ccombination\u201d approach fails \nhere, where both Congress\u2019s delegation and the \nFCC\u2019s reliance on the Administrator raise no serious \nconstitutional issue. In addition, no precedent \nsupports the use of a combination approach outside \nthe removal context.  \nMoreover, the reasoning of Free Enterprise Fund \nis inapplicable to nondelegation cases. In that case, \nthe Court identified a structural problem: the \ncombination of tenure protection at two levels meant \nthat \u201c[n]either the President \u2026 nor even an officer \nwhose conduct he may review only for good cause, \nha[d] full control over\u201d the entity at issue in that \ncase. 561 U.S. at 496. In contrast, the FCC has full \nauthority \nto \ncontrol \nthe \nAdministrator, \neven \nassuming (contrary to fact) that it is not adequately \nsupervising that entity under current rules. There is \nthus no structural problem analogous to the problem \nthe Court identified in Free Enterprise Fund.  \nARGUMENT \nI. This Case Is Not Moot. \nThe Fifth Circuit correctly found the injury \nalleged by the petitioners in that court capable of \nrepetition yet evading review. Pet. App. 13a. The \nFCC adopts the contribution factor each quarter, and \nthe three months during which the contribution \nmust be paid is too little time for \u201cconsidered plenary \nreview in this Court.\u201d Neb. Press Ass\u2019n v. Stuart, 427 \nU.S. 539, 547 (1976). \nThis Court has never held that a challenger must \nexhaust every potential avenue for preliminary relief \n\n19 \n \nfor this exception to mootness to apply. And while \nsome courts have denied application of the exception \nwhere a challenger\u2019s \u201cprocedural missteps \u2026 prevent \njudicial review,\u201d Protestant Mem\u2019l Med. Ctr., Inc. v. \nMaram, 471 F.3d 724, 731 (7th Cir. 2006), this is not \nsuch a case. The challengers filed their petition for \nreview promptly after the FCC adopted the First \nQuarter 2022 contribution factor. The FCC collects \ncontributions on a monthly basis,26 and those \ncollections are used for ongoing Fund operations, \nincluding disbursements to recipients of Fund \nsupport. In this context, mandating that a challenger \nseek a stay of the contribution factor to bring any \nchallenge would be extremely disruptive given the \ngrave harm that could ensue for other stakeholders. \nParticularly here, where there is no dispute that the \nobligation to contribute recurs on a clear, periodic \nbasis (as it has for many years), there is no benefit to \ndenying application of this mootness exception.  \nIf the Court does find the case moot, it should \nvacate the judgment below under its \u201cwell settled\u201d \nMunsingwear practice. Acheson Hotels, LLC v. \nLaufer, 601 U.S. 1, 5 (2023); see United States v. \nMunsingwear, Inc., 340 U.S. 36 (1950). If the case is \nmoot, it occurred before the Fifth Circuit decision, \nand that decision should not be binding in that \ncircuit.  \n \n26 See, e.g., How to Pay, USAC, https://www.usac.org/\nservice-providers/making-payments/how-to-pay/ (last upd-\nated Oct. 2024) (\u201cUSF payments are due on the 15th of \neach month.\u201d). \n\n20 \n \nII. Congress Provided Ample Direction to the \nFCC Regarding the Universal Service Fund.  \nSection 254 passes muster under any plausible \nunderstanding of the limits the Constitution places \non delegation to agencies.  \nA. Section 254 Provides Extensive Guidance \nto the FCC. \nWhen Congress adopted Section 254 in 1996, it \nwas well aware that the FCC had previously created \nhigh-cost and lifeline programs, relying in part on \nCongress\u2019s direction that the Commission \u201cmake \navailable, so far as possible, to all the people of the \nUnited States \u2026 a rapid, efficient, Nation-wide, and \nworld-wide wire and radio communications service \nwith adequate facilities at reasonable charges,\u201d 47 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 151.27 Congress also recognized that the \npre-1996 Act universal service regime relied on \nimplicit subsidies under which some customers paid \nhigher fees to keep rates affordable for other, lower-\nincome and higher-cost consumers.  \nBecause implicit subsidies cannot survive in a \ncompetitive environment, Congress in the 1996 Act \ndirected the FCC to move to an explicit subsidy \nregime. See 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(e). And, to create the \nnecessary parameters for such a new regime, \n \n27 See also 1997 Universal Service Order \u00b6 329 (citing 47 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151, 154(i), 201, and 205 in summarizing pre-\n1996 Act authority); see NARUC, 737 F.2d at 1108 n.6 \n(rejecting argument that FCC had no authority over \nuniversal service because, in 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 151, \u201cCongress \ndirected that, \u2018so far as possible, ... all people of the \nUnited States\u2019 are to have adequate telephone facilities at \nreasonable prices\u201d). \n\n21 \n \nSection 254 provided significantly more statutory \ndirection as to the key inputs that determine the size \nof the universal service fund and thus the amount of \nthe quarterly contribution factor.  \nCongress specified the entities that must pay into \nthe regime: \u201cEvery telecommunications carrier that \nprovides interstate telecommunications services\u201d \nmust contribute toward the universal service \nmechanisms created under the statute. Id. \u00a7 254(d).28 \nCongress further provided that those payments must \nbe \u201cequitable and nondiscriminatory.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(d).  \nCongress \nlikewise \nconstrained \nthe \nFCC\u2019s \nauthority as to the services that could be part of the \n\u201cuniversal service\u201d program. While giving the FCC \nthe authority to determine the \u201cevolving level\u201d of \nservices that should be covered, Congress generally \nlimited \nthe \nagency \nto \nsupporting \n\u201ctelecomm-\nunications services\u201d\u2014a statutorily defined term that \ninvolves common carriage29\u2014as well as other \n \n28 Congress allowed the FCC to expand this class to \ninclude \u201cproviders of interstate telecommunications\u201d if it \nmade an appropriate public interest finding. See id.; see \nalso 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 153(50), (53) (defining \u201ctelecomm-\nunications\u201d and \u201ctelecommunications service\u201d). The FCC \nhas exercised that authority only to a limited degree to \nadd, for instance, payphone providers and interconnected \nVoice over Internet Protocol services to the class of \ncontributors. See 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.706(a).  \n29 See 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 153(53) (defining \u201ctelecommunications \nservice\u201d as \u201cthe offering of telecommunications for a fee \ndirectly to the public, or to such classes of users as to be \neffectively available directly to the public, regardless of \nthe facilities used\u201d). \n\n22 \n \nservices, including broadband, if they are provided \nover the same \u201cfacilities.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(c)(1), (e).30 \nCongress also mandated that, in deciding on the \ncovered services, the agency evaluate the extent to \nwhich such services \u201care essential to education, \npublic \nhealth, \nor \npublic \nsafety,\u201d \nhave \n\u201cbeen \nsubscribed to by a substantial majority of residential \ncustomers,\u201d and \u201care being deployed in public \ntelecommunications networks by telecommunications \ncarriers, as well as being \u201cconsistent with the public \ninterest, convenience, and necessity.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(c)(1).31  \nCongress \nalso \nspecified \nwho \nmay \nreceive \nsubsidies: \u201c[O]nly an eligible telecommunications \ncarrier designated under [47 U.S.C. \u00a7 214(e)] shall be \neligible to receive specific Federal universal service \nsupport.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(e); see id. \u00a7 214(e) \n(enumerating criteria for eligible telecommunications \ncarriers). For particular programs, Congress also \ndefined the customers whose services must be \n \n30 See \n2011 \nUSF \nTransformation \nOrder \n\u00b6\u00b6 64-65 \n(\u201cSection 254(e) thus contemplates that carriers may \nreceive federal support to enable the deployment of \nbroadband \nfacilities \nused \nto \nprovide \nsupported \ntelecommunications services as well as other services.\u201d), \naff\u2019d, In re FCC 11-161, 753 F.3d 1015 (10th Cir. 2014); \nsee IIJA \u00a7 60104(c)(1)-(3) (directing that the FCC \u201cmay \nnot in any way reduce the congressional mandate to \nachieve the universal service goal for broadband\u201d). \n31 Congress also authorized the FCC to designate \nadditional services for support for schools, libraries, and \nhealth care providers that serve the purposes of \nSection 254(h). See id. \u00a7 254(c)(3); Tex. Off. of Pub. Util. \nCouns. v. FCC, 183 F.3d 393, 441 (5th Cir. 1999) \n(\u201cTOPUC I\u201d).  \n\n23 \n \ndiscounted \nbased \non \nthat \nsupport. \nSee \nid. \n\u00a7 254(h)(1)(A)-(B) (for Rural Health Care program, \n\u201cany public or nonprofit health care provider that \nserves persons who reside in rural areas in that \nState,\u201d \nand \nfor \nE-Rate, \n\u201celementary \nschools, \nsecondary schools, and libraries\u201d).  \nBeyond \nthis, \nin \nSection \n254(b), \nCongress \nspecifically identified the principles (quoted in full \nsupra pp.4-6) the FCC should advance in making its \njudgments implementing the statute. A number of \nthese principles are especially relevant to limiting \nthe size of the universal service fund, and thus the \namount of the quarterly contribution factor. The \nrequirement in Section 254(b)(1) that quality service \nremain \u201caffordable\u201d32 is significant because, as the \nFCC has explained, \u201cif the universal service burden \nis too high, the affordability of service will be placed \nin jeopardy, undermining the very purpose of the \nuniversal service program.\u201d33  \nLikewise, the principle enunciated in Section \n254(b)(5) (and Section 254(d)) that USF mechanisms \nbe not only \u201cspecific\u201d and \u201cpredictable,\u201d but also \n\u201csufficient\u201d imposes an obligation to ensure that the \nFund is large enough, but not too large, to achieve \nthe statutory goals. Addressing judicial decisions \ndiscussing the text of Section 254, the FCC thus \ndefined the term to mean \u201can affordable and \nsustainable amount of support that is adequate, but \n \n32 See also 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(i) (\u201cThe Commission \u2026 should \nensure that universal service is available at rates that are \njust, reasonable, and affordable.\u201d). \n33 Lifeline and Link Up Reform and Modernization, et al., \n27 \nFCC \nRcd. \n6656, \n\u00b6 37 \n(2012) \n(\u201c2012 \nLifeline \nModernization Order\u201d).  \n\n24 \n \nno greater than necessary, to achieve the goals of the \nuniversal service program.\u201d34 The Fifth Circuit itself \nhas read this language to confirm that \u201cexcessive \nfunding \nmay \nitself \nviolate \nthe \nsufficiency \nrequirements.\u201d Alenco Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v. FCC, 201 \nF.3d 608, 620 (5th Cir. 2000).  \nSection \n254, \nmoreover, \nprovides \nadditional \nspecific guidance as to the amount that universal \nservice subsidies should reduce end-user rates, again \nlimiting the potential size of the universal service \nfund. Supported services for consumers in high-cost \nareas and low-income consumers should be \u201cat rates \nthat are reasonably comparable to rates charged for \nsimilar service in urban areas.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(b)(3). \nRural health care providers should be served at rates \n\u201creasonably comparable\u201d to those for similar services \nin urban areas in the same state. Id. \u00a7 254(h)(1)(A). \nSchools and libraries \u201cshall\u201d receive service at \u201crates \nless than the amounts charged for similar services to \nother parties,\u201d through a discount \u201cappropriate and \nnecessary to ensure affordable access to and use of \nsuch services.\u201d Id. \u00a7 254(h)(1)(B). And for access to \n\u201cadvanced \nservices\u201d\u2014which \nincludes \nbroadband \nInternet \naccess \nfor \nschools, \nlibraries, \nand \nhospitals35\u2014the statute directs the FCC to establish \nrules that account for what is \u201ceconomically \nreasonable.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(h)(2)(A). Four years ago, \nCongress passed legislation confirming the FCC\u2019s \n \n34 High Cost Universal Service Support, et al., 25 FCC \nRcd. 4072, \u00b6\u00b6 3, 30 (2010) (emphasis added). \n35 See Modernizing the E-rate Program for Schools and \nLibraries, 29 FCC Rcd. 8870, \u00b6\u00b6 68-70 (2014); Rural \nHealth Care Support Mechanism, 27 FCC Rcd. 16778, \n\u00b6 39 (2012). \n\n25 \n \n\u201ccongressional mandate to achieve the universal \nservice goal for broadband\u201d and tasking the FCC \nwith preparing a report on how to improve the \nFund.36 \nConsistent \nwith \nthis \nsubstantial \nlegislative \nguidance, the FCC has repeatedly concluded that \nSection 254 constrains the Commission\u2019s decision-\nmaking. For instance, the FCC has established \nannual monetary caps for the USF programs to fulfill \nits \u201cstatutory obligation to create a specific, \npredictable, and sufficient universal service support \nmechanism.\u201d37 Likewise, the FCC declined to extend \nsupport to rural home care providers, explaining that \nSection 254(h) limited support to statutorily defined \nhealth care providers.38 Similarly, just last year, the \nFCC rejected calls for it to support certain broadband \nwireless technologies because, as it explained, it \n\u201cremain[s] focused on the statutory obligation to \nestablish rules that enhance access to the extent it is \n\u2018economically reasonable.\u2019\u201d39  \nMoreover, \ncontrary \nto \nthe \nFifth \nCircuit\u2019s \nsuggestion that Section 254 is so lacking in guidance \nthat \u201cno reviewing court could ever possibly \ninvalidate any FCC action,\u201d Pet. App. 40a-41a, the \nFifth Circuit and other federal courts have enforced \nSection 254\u2019s limits on multiple occasions. See, e.g., \n \n36 IIJA \u00a7 60104(c)(1)-(3). \n37 1997 Universal Service Order \u00b6 529 (establishing initial \ncap for the E-Rate program); id. \u00b6 705 (establishing initial \ncap for the Rural Health Care program). \n38 Id. \u00b6 656. \n39 Addressing the Homework Gap Through the E-Rate \nProgram, FCC 24-76, WC Docket No. 21-31, \u00b6 25 \n(rel.

That decision reinforces the importance of the \nstatutory guardrails that courts can and do impose \nby enforcing the extensive prescriptive language of \nSection 254.

The Fifth Circuit\u2019s Contrary Assessment \nof Section 254 Disregards the Significant \nConstraints on FCC Discretion. \nThe Fifth Circuit majority\u2019s contrary analysis of \nSection 254 is inconsistent with the statute\u2019s text \nand surrounding context.  \nTo begin, the Fifth Circuit suggests that \nSection 254\u2019s definition of \u201cuniversal service\u201d is not \n\u201cmeaningful\u201d because the concept of \u201cuniversal \nservice\u201d \nis \nnot \n\u201csufficiently \nintelligible.\u201d \nPet. \nApp. 26a. But the statutory text belies that \nconclusion. As noted above, Congress defined \nuniversal service to be an evolving level of \n\u201ctelecommunications services,\u201d which is a defined \nterm, see 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 153(53), and the statute \ngenerally authorizes support only for those services \nand other services such as broadband that use the \nsupported \nfacilities. \nSee \nid. \n\u00a7 254(e); \nsupra \npp.21-22.40 \nIn \naddition, \nSection 254(c) \nspecifies \nnearly \nmathematical criteria for FCC use in determining \nwhether a particular service qualifies for universal \nservice support. As noted, those criteria include \nwhether the service is subscribed to \u201cby a substantial \nmajority of residential customers\u201d and is \u201cbeing \ndeployed in public telecommunications networks by \ntelecommunications \ncarriers.\u201d \n47 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(c)(1)(B)-(C).  \n \n40 As noted above, Section 254(c) authorizes the FCC to \nprovide additional support for schools, libraries, and \nhealth care providers, but only where that is consistent \nwith the policies in Section 254(h). See supra n.31. \n\n28 \n \nSection 254(c) further mandates that the FCC \nconsider whether a particular service is \u201cessential to \neducation, \npublic \nhealth, \nor \npublic \nsafety.\u201d \nId. \u00a7 254(c)(1)(A). \nAlthough \nthe \nFifth \nCircuit \nsuggested without explanation that \u201cessential\u201d is not \na meaningful direction, Pet. App. 29a, that is a \ncommon word that can be readily understood in \naccordance with its plain meaning. See American \nHeritage Dictionary (5th ed. 2022) (\u201c1. Constituting \nor being part of the nature or essence of something; \ninherent \n\u2026 \n2. Fundamentally \nimportant \nor \nnecessary \u2026 .\u201d). The FCC thus readily applied that \nterm in 1997 in establishing nine core services \nsupported \nby \nthe \nfederal \nuniversal \nservice \nmechanisms.41 For instance, the FCC concluded that \nsingle-party service was \u201cessential to public health \nand safety in that it allows residential consumers \naccess to emergency services without delay.\u201d42  \nBeyond that, as discussed above and as the Fifth \nCircuit previously explained, the fact that support \nshould be \u201csufficient\u201d to preserve and advance \nuniversal service itself limits the Fund to enough \nsupport, but not too much, to achieve Congress\u2019s \nobjectives. See supra pp.23-24. Although, as the Fifth \nCircuit noted, that requirement may not mandate \nsupport that precisely \u201c\u2018equal[s] the actual costs \nincurred\u2019\u201d by each carrier, Pet. App. 27a (quoting \nTOPUC I, 183 F.3d at 412), that is far from failing to \nprovide any meaningful limitation on FCC action. \nIndeed, in the portion of TOPUC I the circuit court \nmajority cited, the Fifth Circuit noted that, as used \nin Section 254, \u201csufficiency\u201d was a \u201cdirect statutory \n \n41 See 1997 Universal Service Order \u00b6\u00b6 61-83. \n42 Id. \u00b6 62. \n\n29 \n \ncommand.\u201d Id. at 95a. And in that case, the Fifth \nCircuit approved the FCC\u2019s use of \u201cforward-looking \ncosts\u201d rather than historical costs, which reduces the \namount of support carriers receive and the size of the \nFund. See 183 F.3d at 411; see also Verizon \nCommc\u2019ns v. FCC, 535 U.S. 467, 475 (2002) \n(affirming the FCC\u2019s reliance on forward-looking \ncosts to set just and reasonable rates under 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 252(d)(1), which was also part of the 1996 Act).  \nSimilarly, the specific principles that Congress \nrequired the FCC to \u201cbase\u201d its \u201cpolicies\u201d on in \nSection 254(b) cannot be disregarded on the basis \nthat they are \u201caspirational.\u201d Pet. App. 28a. While it \nis undoubtedly the case that those principles cannot \n\u201coverrid[e] other portions of the Act,\u201d TOPUC I, 183 \nF.3d at 421, the FCC in fact \u201cmust work to achieve \neach one unless there is a direct conflict between it \nand either another listed principle or some other \nobligation or limitation on the FCC\u2019s authority.\u201d \nQwest, 258 F.3d at 1199.  \nTo be sure, as the Fifth Circuit noted (Pet. App. \n28a), the FCC has authority to adopt additional \nprinciples. Those principles themselves, however, \nmust \nbe \n\u201cnecessary \nand appropriate \nfor \nthe \nprotection of the public interest\u201d and \u201cconsistent with \nthis chapter,\u201d which includes all the limitations \ndiscussed above. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(b)(7). Accordingly, \nin nearly three decades, the FCC has adopted only \ntwo \nsuch \nprinciples\u2014advancing \ncompetitive \nneutrality and using universal service funds to \nsupport advanced services\u2014both of which the FCC \nadopted because they are deeply grounded in the text \n\n30 \n \nof the statute.43 No party has challenged the FCC\u2019s \njudgments on those points in this case. \nSection 254 plainly does not permit the FCC to \nuse the Fund \u201cto create an endowment \u2026 to fund \nwhatever projects it might like.\u201d Pet App. 27a. \nCarriers may use universal service funding \u201conly for \nthe provision, maintenance, and upgrading of \nfacilities and services for which the support is \nintended.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(e). And as discussed, \nSection 254 limits which services qualify as part of \n\u201cuniversal service.\u201d See 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(c). \nNor is there significant ambiguity regarding \n\u201cwhich \nschools \nand \nlibraries \nshould \nreceive \nsubsidized services.\u201d Pet. App. 29a. The statute \nmakes clear that all schools and libraries that are \neligible and that meet the statutory definition should \nreceive subsidized service. Section 254(h)(1)(B) states \nthat \u201c[a]ll telecommunications carriers\u201d receiving a \n\u201cbona fide\u201d request from \u201celementary schools, \nsecondary schools, and libraries,\u201d \u201cshall\u201d provide the \nrelevant \nsupported \nservices \nat \nthe \nrelevant \ndiscounted rate. (emphases added). See also 47 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 254(h)(4), (h)(7)(A) (defining elementary and \nsecondary school and providing criteria for school \nand library eligibility).  \nNor was the Fifth Circuit correct in suggesting \neither \nthat \n(1) \u201cthe \nonly \nreal \nconstraint\u201d \nis \nSection 254(b)(1)\u2019s reference to rates remaining \n\u201caffordable\u201d or (2) that that term is \u201cno guidance \nwhatsoever.\u201d Pet. App. 30a (internal quotation marks \nomitted). As explained, there are multiple additional \n \n43 See 1997 Universal Service Order \u00b6 43; 2011 USF \nTransformation Order \u00b6\u00b6 10, 44, 64-65. \n\n31 \n \nconstraints on the size of the universal service \ncontribution factor. See supra pp.20-24. Moreover, \nand \ncontrary \nto \nthe \nFifth \nCircuit \nmajority\u2019s \nunderstanding, the word \u201caffordable\u201d is not rendered \nmeaningless when a product is so necessary that \ndemand is \u201cuncommonly inelastic.\u201d Pet. App. 30a. \nThe FCC resolved this precise issue nearly 30 years \nago, concluding that it must \u201cconsider both the \nabsolute and relative components when making the \naffordability determinations required under section \n254.\u201d44 In determining affordability, it thus must \nassess not only rates, but also \u201cnon-rate factors, such \nas consumer income levels, that can be used to assess \nthe financial burden\u201d created by subscribing to a \nparticular service.45   \nC. Section 254 Is Consistent with Precedent \nand Constitutional History and Would \nSatisfy Any Reasonable Nondelegation \nTest. \nPrecedent strongly supports the conclusion that \nSection 254 does not improperly delegate legislative \npower in violation of Article I, Section 1\u2019s Vesting \nClause. That is equally true even under the more \nrestrictive delegation standards advocated by some \nJustices. \n1. \nAlthough \nthe \nVesting \nClause \nprohibits \ndelegating Congress\u2019s unique legislative power to an \nagency, it has long been established that Congress \nmay lawfully delegate \u201cthe authority to make policies \nand rules that implement its statutes.\u201d Loving v. \nUnited States, 517 U.S. 748, 771 (1996). Thus, the \n \n44 1997 Universal Service Order \u00b6 110.  \n45 Id. \n\n32 \n \nCourt has repeatedly held that there is no \nconstitutional issue where Congress identifies an \n\u201c\u2018intelligible principle\u2019 to guide the delegee\u2019s exercise \nof authority.\u201d Gundy, 588 U.S. at 145 (plurality) \n(quoting J.W. Hampton, Jr., & Co. v. United States, \n276 U.S. 394, 409 (1928)). And as the Court has \nexplained in language that is particularly apt for the \nfast-changing world of telecommunications, \u201cin our \nincreasingly complex society, replete with ever \nchanging and more technical problems, Congress \nsimply cannot do its job absent an ability to delegate \npower under broad general directives.\u201d Mistretta v. \nUnited States, 488 U.S. 361, 372 (1989).  \nThe \nCourt\u2019s \napplication \nof \nthat \nprinciple \ndemonstrates that Section 254 is a permissible \ndelegation. The Court, for instance, has upheld the \nFCC\u2019s issuance of regulations governing radio \nlicensing based on the \u201cpublic interest, convenience, \nor necessity.\u201d NBC v. United States, 319 U.S. 190, \n215 (1943) (citing 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 307(a), (d), 309(a), \n310, 312). In so doing, the Court rejected the claim \nthat the \u201cpublic interest\u201d standard is \u201cso vague and \nindefinite\u201d that the \u201cdelegation is unconstitutional,\u201d \nexplaining that \u201c\u2018[t]he purpose of the Act, the \nrequirements it imposes, and the context of the \nprovision\u2019\u201d make the statutory language more than a \n\u201c\u2018mere general reference to public welfare.\u2019\u201d Id. at \n225-26 (quoting Fed. Radio Comm\u2019n v. Nelson Bros. \nBond & Mortg. Co., 289 U.S. 266, 285 (1933)).  \nAs discussed above, the specific directions \nimposed by the text of Section 254 are far more \nreticulated \nand \nprescriptive \nthan \nthe \n\u201cpublic \ninterest\u201d standard upheld in NBC. See NARUC, 737 \nF.2d at 1129. Indeed, as it codified what services \nshould be supported, Congress mandated that the \n\n33 \n \nFCC consider a number of factual considerations in \naddition to the public interest. See 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(c)(1) (FCC \u201cshall consider\u201d what services are \n\u201cessential\u201d to education, health, or safety; are being \n\u201csubscribed \nto \nby \na \nsubstantial \nmajority \nof \nresidential consumers\u201d; and are being \u201cdeployed in \npublic telecommunications networks\u201d). Beyond that, \nCongress provided guidance as to what kinds of \nservices could be supported; which entities should be \nassessed to support those services; how those entities \nshould be assessed; and how much support could be \nrequired, among many other things. See, e.g., id. \n\u00a7 254(d), (e), (h). Unlike the statutory text at issue in \nNBC, \nSection \n254 \nexplicitly \nenumerates \nsix \nprinciples Congress sought to advance. See id. \n\u00a7 254(b). And, as in NBC, these provisions must be \nunderstood in the context of the goals of the 1996 Act \nand the FCC\u2019s history of universal service regulation.  \nNBC is only one of a number of cases to approve \ndelegations through language that is far more \ngeneral than that at issue here. Many of those cases \ninvolve public utility regulations setting rates. See, \ne.g., Sunshine Anthracite, 310 U.S. at 398 (approving \ndelegation to set coal prices because \u201cappropriate-\nness of the criterion of the \u2018public interest\u2019 in various \ncontexts \u2026 make it clear that there is a valid \ndelegation of authority in this case\u201d); Yakus v. United \nStates, 321 U.S. 414, 420 (1944) (upholding authority \nof Administrator to promulgate regulations fixing \nprices of commodities that \u201c\u2018in his judgment will be \ngenerally fair and equitable and will effectuate the \npurposes of this Act\u2019 when, in his judgment, their \nprices \u2018have risen or threaten to rise to an extent or \nin a manner inconsistent with the purposes of this \nAct\u2019\u201d) (quoting statute); see also Whitman v. Am. \nTrucking Ass\u2019ns, 531 U.S. 457, 472 (2001) (approving \n\n34 \n \ndelegation to the EPA to set \u201cambient air quality \nstandards\u201d that \u201care requisite to protect the public \nhealth\u201d).  \nContrary \nto \nthe \nFifth \nCircuit \nmajority\u2019s \nsuggestion, NBC cannot be disregarded on the basis \nthat the \u201cpublic owns the airwaves,\u201d so that \u201cprivate \npeople may use that resource only on terms the \ngovernment sets.\u201d Pet. App. 35a-36a (cleaned up). \nThe Executive has not exercised unique authority to \nact there without a congressional delegation: \u201cBefore \n1927, the allocation of frequencies was left entirely to \nthe private sector,\u201d and Congress established the \nFederal Radio Commission \u201cto allocate frequencies \namong competing applicants.\u201d Red Lion Broad. Co. v. \nFCC, 395 U.S. 367, 375-77 (1969). Perhaps for that \nreason, the Fifth Circuit cites no language from NBC \nor any other case invoking such reasoning.  \nThe Fifth Circuit also erred in suggesting that, \nunlike in the many other cases where this Court has \napproved delegations far less constrained than the \none at issue here, the FCC lacks any \u201cspecial agency \nexpertise\u201d \nrelevant \nto \nuniversal \nservice. \nPet. \nApp. 40a. In fact, this Court has for nearly a century \nacknowledged the FCC\u2019s (and its predecessor\u2019s) \nexpertise \nin \nthe \nfast-changing \nworld \nof \ntelecommunications and technology. See Nelson Bros. \nBond & Mortg. Co., 289 U.S. at 276 (\u201cCongress \nestablished the Commission as its instrumentality to \nprovide continuous and expert supervision and to \nexercise the administrative judgment essential in \napplying \nlegislative \nstandards \nto \na \nhost \nof \ninstances.\u201d); FCC v. Nat\u2019l Citizens Comm. for Broad., \n436 U.S. 775, (1978) (deference warranted for FCC\u2019s \npredictive factual determinations, as \u201cforecast[s] of \nthe direction in which future public interest lies \n\n35 \n \nnecessarily involves deductions based on the expert \nknowledge of the agency\u201d) (internal quotation \nomitted). Congress explicitly invoked that expertise \nin asking the FCC to \u201cestablish\u201d the \u201cevolving level of \ntelecommunications \nservices\u201d \nthat \nconstitute \nuniversal service, \u201ctaking into account advances in \ntelecommunications and information technologies \nand services.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(c).  \nThe \nFifth \nCircuit\u2019s \nsuggestion \nthat \nthe \nconstitutional analysis is different here because the \nUSF contributions are allegedly a \u201ctax\u201d likewise runs \ncounter to this Court\u2019s precedents. Pet. App. 19a-23a. \nThe Court has held that there is no \u201cdifferent and \nstricter nondelegation doctrine in cases where \nCongress delegates discretionary authority to the \nExecutive under its taxing power.\u201d Skinner v. Mid-\nAm. Pipeline Co., 490 U.S. 212, 222-23 (1989). \n2. Section 254 does not raise the same issues \nthat concerned the Justices who dissented in Gundy. \nThe statute in Gundy allowed the Attorney General \nto \n\u201cspecify \nthe \napplicability\u201d \nof \nregistration \nrequirements to sex offenders convicted before the \nstatute\u2019s passage and \u201cprescribe rules.\u201d 588 U.S. at \n151, 177 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting). Justice Gorsuch \nconcluded that the statutory language \u201cgave the \nAttorney General free rein to write the rules for \nvirtually the entire existing sex offender population \nin this country.\u201d Id. at 151. Section 254, as discussed \nabove, bears no resemblance to that kind of \nlanguage.  \nLikewise, \nSection \n254 \nwould \nsatisfy \nthe \nalternative test proposed by Justice Gorsuch in \nGundy. In particular, Congress has \u201cannounced the \ncontrolling general polic[ies]\u201d underlying Section 254. \nId. at 157. Among other things, Congress has: \n\n36 \n \n\u2022 Made the decision to support universal service \nand told the FCC what factors to consider in \ndetermining \nwhich \nparticular \n\u201ctelecomm-\nunications services\u201d and associated facilities to \nsupport. See 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(c)(1), (e).  \n\u2022 Defined which entities must pay fees to \nsupport universal service. See id. \u00a7 254(d).  \n\u2022 Established which entities are eligible to \nreceive universal service support, criteria \nthose entities must meet, and for what \nservices they can use that funding. See id. \n\u00a7\u00a7 214(e), 254(e).  \n\u2022 Adopted a series of principles that the FCC \nmust follow in making decisions under \nSection 254. See id. \u00a7 254(b)(1)-(6). \n\u2022 Created, through those principles and other \nexplicit statutory text, meaningful limits on \nthe extent to which specific services can be \nfunded, thus limiting the size of the fund. \nSee supra pp.21-24.  \nIn all these instances, Congress has \u201cset forth \nstandards \u2018sufficiently definite and precise to enable \nCongress, the courts, and the public to ascertain\u2019 \nwhether Congress\u2019s guidance has been followed.\u201d \nGundy, 588 U.S. at 158 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting) \n(quoting Yakus, 321 U.S. at 426). \nThe decisions left to the FCC are thus reasonably \nunderstood to be authorizations to apply the \nstatutory text and policies to evolving factual \ncircumstances\u2014or, in other words, to \u201c\u2018fill up the \ndetails.\u2019\u201d Id. at 157 (quoting Wayman v. Southard, 23 \nU.S. 1, 43 (1825)); see id. at 158 (agencies permitted \nto engage in \u201cfact-finding\u201d). The FCC determines, for \ninstance, what services have \u201cbeen subscribed to by a \n\n37 \n \nsubstantial majority of residential customers\u201d and \nare \u201cbeing deployed in public telecommunications \nnetworks by telecommunications carriers.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(c)(1)(B)-(C); see, e.g., 1997 Universal Service \nOrder \u00b6 63 (concluding voice service should be \ncovered \u201cconsistent with section 254(c)(1)\u201d); 2012 \nLifeline Modernization Order \u00b6\u00b6 397-98 (declining to \nmake payphones eligible for Lifeline support upon \nfinding that they were not used by a substantial \nmajority of residential consumers).  \nThe \nagency \nlikewise \ndetermines \nwhat \nis \nnecessary for health care providers and those living \nin high-cost areas to have access at rates that are \n\u201creasonably comparable\u201d to access in urban areas, 47 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 254(b)(3), (h)(1)(A), and for schools and \nlibraries to have access at rates \u201cless than the \namounts charged for similar services to other \nparties,\u201d id. \u00a7 254(h)(1)(B). For instance, in the Rural \nHealth Care program, the FCC determines what \nconstitutes sufficient funding by subtracting the \nurban rate in the state from the rural rate for similar \n(i.e., \u201creasonably comparable\u201d) services. See 47 C.F.R. \n\u00a7\u00a7 54.603-605. \nSimilarly, \nthe \nFCC \nfulfills \nits \nstatutory directive in the E-Rate program through its \n\u201clowest corresponding price\u201d rules. See id. \u00a7\u00a7 54.500, \n54.511(b) (prohibiting providers from submitting bids \nhigher than the price charged to non-residential \ncustomers that are similarly situated to the \nparticular school or library \u201cfor similar services\u201d). \nThe fact that the FCC\u2019s granular implementation of \nthe program flows directly from the statutory \ndirectives cannot be squared with the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \nconclusion that Congress left the agency at sea, \nwithout significant guidance. \n\n38 \n \n3. The delegation of authority in Section 254 is \nalso consistent with the practice of the early \nCongresses, \nwhich \nthis \nCourt \nhas \nrepeatedly \nemphasized are a good guide to the original \nunderstanding of the Constitution. See, e.g., Bowsher \nv. Synar, 478 U.S. 714, 723-24 (1986).  \nThe practice of those Congresses demonstrates \nthat the Founders understood that delegations far \nbroader than the one at issue here were consistent \nwith the constitutional structure. For instance, the \nFirst Congress passed a bill to authorize the \nPresident of the Senate, the Chief Justice, the \nSecretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, \nand the Attorney General (or any three of them), to \npurchase an unspecified amount of certain debt \nwith the approbation of the President of the \nUnited States \u2026 in such manner, and under \nsuch regulations as shall appear to them best \ncalculated to fulfill the intent of this act: \nProvided, That the same be made openly, and \nwith due regard to the equal benefit of the \nseveral states \u2026 .  \nAct of Aug. 12, 1790, ch. 47, \u00a7 2, 1 Stat. 186, 186.  \nSimilarly, in 1798, the Fifth Congress\u2014which \nstill included in its ranks many Framers46\u2014adopted \na direct tax to be apportioned among the states. \n \n46 See Nevada Comm\u2019n on Ethics v. Carrigan, 564 U.S. \n117, 122 (2011) (\u201c[e]arly congressional enactments \nprovide contemporaneous and weighty evidence of the \nConstitution\u2019s meaning,\u201d and finding it \u201cdispositive\u201d that \n\u201c[w]ithin 15 years of the founding, both the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate adopted \u2026 rules\u201d akin to \nthose at issue in the case) (cleaned up). \n\n39 \n \nSee Act of July 9, 1798, ch. 70, \u00a7 8, 1 Stat. 580, 585. \nCongress levied the tax, but then allowed tax \ncommissioners to \u201crevise, adjust and vary, the \nvaluations of lands and dwelling-houses in any \nassessment district \u2026 [at] such a rate \u2026 as shall \nappear to be just and equitable: Provided, that the \nrelative valuations of the different lots or tracts of \nland, or dwelling-houses, in the same assessment \ndistrict, shall not be changed or affected.\u201d Id. \u00a7 22, \n1 Stat. at 589. In other words, Congress again \nenacted a delegation far broader than the one at \nissue here: \u201c[F]ederal administrators had the power \nto raise or lower the tax assessments of thousands of \nproperty owners all at once, by any percentage \namount, so long as the change \u2018shall appear to be just \nand equitable.\u2019\u201d Nicholas R.

Rev. 367 (2024). \n\n40 \n \nIII. The FCC Exercises Direction and Control \nOver the Administrator. \nThe Administrator\u2019s role providing ministerial \nsupport to the FCC in managing the Fund is likewise \nwell within the bounds of this Court\u2019s private \nnondelegation \nprecedents. \nThe \nFifth \nCircuit \nmajority\u2019s suggestion to the contrary is based on an \n\u201cexaggerated conception\u201d of the Administrator\u2019s \u201crole \nand discretion.\u201d Pet. App. 103a (Stewart, J., \ndissenting).  \nA. In determining whether a delegation to a \nprivate actor is permissible, this Court has focused \non whether \u201claw-making is \u2026 entrusted to\u201d a private \nactor and whether a private actor \u201cfunction[s] \nsubordinately to\u201d a government actor with the ability \nto exercise \u201cauthority and surveillance\u201d over it. \nSunshine Anthracite, 310 U.S. at 399. In this case, \nthose factors point decisively toward the lawfulness \nof the Commission\u2019s reliance on the Administrator. \nAdditionally, although the Fifth Circuit analyzed \nfactors that go beyond this Court\u2019s precedents, see \nPet. App. 46a-47a, those factors likewise support the \nlawfulness of the Administrator\u2019s ministerial role.  \nMost significantly, responsibility for carrying out \nCongress\u2019s direction in Section 254 is \u201cnot entrusted \nto\u201d the Administrator; rather, the Administrator \nremains subordinate to the FCC in all respects. \nSunshine Anthracite, 310 U.S. at 399; see Pet. \nApp. 46a (agency \u201cmust have final decision-making \nauthority\u201d). The FCC adopts the rules defining the \nscope of the various Fund programs, the eligible \nrecipients consistent with the statute, and the \namounts of the subsidies (including through rules \ngoverning competitive bidding to determine subsidy \namounts for particular recipients). Those rules \n\n41 \n \ninclude \u201celigibility requirements,\u201d \u201ccaps on particular \ntypes of support,\u201d and \u201cprecise formulas for \ncalculating the amount of the subsidy\u201d in particular \nprograms.\u201d FCC Pet. 20 (citing 47 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 54.410, \n54.507, 54.604-606).  \nMoreover, FCC rules explicitly prohibit the \nAdministrator from \u201cmak[ing] policy, interpret[ing] \nunclear provisions of the statute or rules or \ninterpret[ing] the intent of Congress.\u201d 47 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 54.702(c). Where the Administrator is in doubt, it \n\u201cshall seek guidance from the Commission.\u201d Id.  \nRegarding the quarterly contribution factor in \nparticular, the factor \u201cshall be determined by the \nCommission,\u201d \nnot \nthe \nAdministrator. \nId. \n\u00a7 54.709(a)(2) (emphasis added). The FCC rules and \ndecisions regarding the Fund programs provide the \nfoundation each quarter for determining both inputs \ninto the factor: the Fund programs\u2019 needs and the \nassessable contribution base.  \nThe Administrator, by contrast, plays only a \nministerial role. For example, on the demand side, \nthe Administrator prepares the \u201cquarterly projected \ncosts of the universal service support mechanisms\u201d \nand the \u201cprojected expenses for the federal universal \nservice support mechanisms for each quarter.\u201d Id. \n\u00a7 54.709(a)(2), (3). But those projections are no more \nthan calculations based on decisions already made by \nthe FCC, together with information provided by \nprivate parties under the FCC\u2019s rules. In this case, \nfor example, the Administrator determined the \nsupport amounts for the various Fund programs by \nwalking through the FCC rules and associated \ndecisions for each program. See, e.g., J.A. 21-33, 46-\n49. The FCC\u2019s caps and other funding limits further \nfactor into each program\u2019s demand calculation. See, \n\n42 \n \ne.g., id. at 46 (noting FCC \u201ccap for Funding Year \n2021\u201d in Rural Health Care program). \nOn top of that, the \u201c[t]otal projected expenses \u2026 \nfor \neach \nquarter \nmust \nbe \napproved \nby \nthe \nCommission before they are used to calculate the \nquarterly contribution factor,\u201d and the Commission \n\u201creserves the right to set projections of demand and \nadministrative \nexpenses \nat \namounts \nthat \n[it] \ndetermines will serve the public interest.\u201d 47 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 54.709(a)(3). \nLikewise, on the contribution-base side the \nAdministrator \n\u201ccompile[s]\u201d \nthe \n\u201ctotal \nsubject \nrevenues\u201d to which the contribution factor will apply \neach quarter, \u201cbased on information contained in the \nTelecommunications Reporting Worksheets,\u201d the \ncontent of which is in turn mandated by the \nCommission\u2019s own rules. Id. \u00a7 54.709(a)(2); see id. \n\u00a7 54.711(a) (FCC rule requiring that contributors \n\u201ccalculate[] and file[]\u201d their contributions based on \nthis Worksheet as \u201cpublished in the Federal \nRegister\u201d by the FCC). In this case, again, the \nAdministrator\u2019s filing shows that the contribution \nbase \u201cwas derived\u201d from information on \u201cForm 499-Q \nsubmissions\u201d the FCC requires). Pet. App. 158a. See \ngenerally U.S. Gov\u2019t Accountability Off., GAO-24-\n106967, \nAdministration \nof \nUniversal \nService \nPrograms \nIs \nConsistent \nwith \nSelected \nFCC \nRequirements, app. II at 21-22 (2024). \nAdditionally, \nthe \nFCC \nsupervises \nall \nthe \nAdministrator\u2019s functions. Pet. App. 47a. In addition \nto the FCC\u2019s direct role in determining the \ncontribution \nfactor \nand \nreviewing \nthe \nAdministrator\u2019s projections, the FCC regularly \nexercises its authority to review the Administrator\u2019s \nministerial handling of claims for support. See 47 \n\n43 \n \nC.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 54.719 (parties may seek review), 54.723 \n(review of Administrator decisions is de novo). The \nCommission has not hesitated in exercising that \nauthority and issues a monthly document disposing \nof appeals of the Administrator\u2019s actions. In April \n2024, the FCC granted 27 of 53 E-Rate and Rural \nHealth Care appeals. See Streamlined Resolution of \nRequests Related to Actions by the Universal Service \nAdministrative Company, 39 FCC Rcd. 2989, 2992 \nn.12 (2024) (\u201c[c]onsistent with our obligation to \nconduct a de novo review of appeals of decisions \nmade by USAC, we grant this request for review\u201d \nbased on \u201cdisagree[ment] with USAC\u2019s conclusion\u201d); \nsee also Streamlined Resolution of Requests Related \nto Actions by the Universal Service Administrative \nCompany, 34 FCC Rcd. 9870, 9872 n.9 (2019) \n(\u201cdirect[ing] USAC\u201d to review remanded applications \nwithin 90 days); Request for Review of a Decision of \nthe Universal Service Support Mechanism, 23 FCC \nRcd. \n15413, \n15416 \n\u00b6 7 \n(2008) \n(reviewing \nAdministrator decision and granting waiver in order \nto \u201cpromote[] the statutory requirements of section \n254(h)\u201d).

See, e.g., 47 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 54.702(g) (annual \nreport from Administrator to FCC and Congress), \n54.702(h) \n(quarterly \nreport \nto \nFCC \n\u201con \nthe \ndisbursement of \u2026 program funds\u201d), 54.702(j) (FCC \nhas \n\u201cfull \naccess \nto \nthe \ndata \ncollected\u201d \nin \nAdministrator\u2019s \nduties), \n54.709(b) \n(FCC \n\u201cmay \ninstruct the Administrator\u201d on how to handle \u201cexcess \ncontributions\u201d beyond steps already provided by \nrule). \n\n44 \n \nB. Contrary to the Fifth Circuit\u2019s understanding, \nthe FCC \u201cactually exercise[s]\u201d its authority each \nquarter to adopt the contribution factor. Pet. \nApp. 47a (emphasis omitted). The Fifth Circuit \nstated that \u201cUSAC\u2019s projections take legal effect \nwithout formal FCC approval,\u201d id. at 49a, but that is \ninconsistent with FCC rules and the actual process \nfor adopting the contribution factor. The FCC\u2019s Office \nof Managing Director\u2014not the Administrator\u2014\nissues the Public Notice announcing the proposed \ncontribution factor, and the absence of any further \naction within fourteen days of the release of that \nPublic Notice means the projections and resulting \ncontribution factor are \u201cdeemed approved by the \nCommission.\u201d 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.709(a)(3). It is thus the \nFCC\u2019s rules that govern approval and modifications.  \nThe Fifth Circuit also stated that the \u201c\u2018approval\u2019 \nprocess for [the Administrator\u2019s] proposals plays out \njust days before the new quarter begins,\u201d leaving the \nFCC \u201cno real choice but to accept [the] proposed \nfigures.\u201d Pet. App. 50a n.17. That, too, is inaccurate. \nThe Administrator must submit its quarterly \nprojections \nof \ndemand \n(including \nprogram \nadministrative expenses) and the \u201cbasis for those \nprojections\u201d to the FCC and its Office of Managing \nDirector \u201cat least sixty (60) calendar days\u201d before the \nstart of each quarter, and must submit the \u201ctotal \ncontribution base ... at least thirty (30) days before.\u201d \n47 \nC.F.R. \n\u00a7 54.709(a)(3). \nIn \naddition, \nthe \nCommission\u2019s Office of Managing Director \u201cshall \nreview\u201d both submissions and provide \u201cany necessary \nfeedback\u201d before either is \u201cpublicly filed with the \nFCC.\u201d FCC/USAC MOU \u00b6 13. And after the \nCommission\u2019s own Office of Managing Director \nreleases the proposed contribution factor, the \nCommission reserves time within which it can revise \n\n45 \n \nthe projected demand and administrative expenses \namounts where necessary to \u201cserve the public \ninterest.\u201d 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.709(a)(3). That the window \nfor this final step is 14 days does not support a \nconclusion that the Commission cannot or does not \nexercise its authority over the Administrator. \nThe Fifth Circuit also stated that the relative \ninfrequency \nwith \nwhich \nthe \nCommission \n\u201csubstantive[ly] \nchange[s]\u201d \nthe \nAdministrator\u2019s \nprojections means that it is a mere rubber stamp. \nPet. App. 50a (emphasis omitted). The legally \nrelevant question is whether the FCC has such \nauthority, not the frequency with which it exercises \nit. See Sunshine Anthracite, 310 U.S. at 399. \nRegardless, as discussed above, the Administrator\u2019s \nprojections are based on extensive FCC rules \ngoverning the various Universal Service Fund \nprograms. See supra pp.11-12. It is unsurprising that \nthe FCC, having established the policies and \ndetermined the amount of necessary revenues and \nthen tasked the Administrator with calculation and \nother \nministerial \ntasks \nto \nimplement \nthose \ndeterminations, does not frequently alter the output \nof that process. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s characterization \nof this system as an unsupervised \u201cblank check\u201d is \nthus incorrect. Pet. App. 53a.  \nIn any event, the government has identified \nmultiple occasions\u2014including before this litigation \nbegan\u2014on \nwhich \nit \nhas \ndeparted \nfrom \nthe \nAdministrator\u2019s \nprojections \nfor \nthe \nquarterly \ncontribution factor. See FCC Pet. 23; Proposed \nFourth Quarter 2023 Universal Service Contribution \nFactor, 38 FCC Rcd. 8362, 8362-63 (2023); Proposed \nThird Quarter 2023 Universal Service Contribution \nFactor, 38 FCC Rcd. 5670, 5670-71 (2023); Revised \n\n46 \n \nSecond Quarter 2003 Universal Service Contribution \nFactor, 18 FCC Rcd. 5097, 5097-98 (2003). The FCC \nhas also discussed its own revisions to the \nmethodology for calculating the contribution factor in \npublic notices for the proposed contribution factor. \nSee, e.g., Proposed First Quarter 2002 Universal \nService Contribution Factor, 16 FCC Rcd. 21334, \n21334 (2001) (FCC \u201creduce[d] the interval between \nthe accrual of revenues and the assessment of \nuniversal service contributions based on those \nrevenues\u201d from 12 months to 6 months). And at \nvarious times, the Commission has \u201cadjust[ed] the \ncontribution factor \u2026 if USAC collect[ed] insufficient \nfunds, or if USAC collect[ed] funds in excess of actual \nexpenses in the prior quarter.\u201d Universal Service \nContribution Methodology; A National Broadband \nPlan for Our Future, 27 FCC Rcd. 5357, \u00b6 351 (2012). \nIn \nmultiple \nways, \nthe \nFCC \nrevises \nthe \nAdministrator\u2019s projections or the contribution factor \nitself. \nThe Fifth Circuit also suggested that the \npossibility that \u201cdisbursements often do not comply \nwith FCC policy\u201d means that the FCC\u2019s role in \ndefining the rules and scope of Fund programs \u201cdoes \nnothing to limit the revenue FCC allows private \nentities to exact from consumers.\u201d Pet. App. 51a. \nThere is no basis in this Court\u2019s precedent for such a \nstandard\u2014an improper payment does not give rise to \na private nondelegation doctrine issue. See id. \nat 122a (Higginson, J., dissenting) (waste and fraud \nhave \u201cnever been enough to declare a coequal \nbranch\u2019s act unconstitutional\u201d). In any event, as \ndiscussed above, the FCC\u2019s rules for Fund programs \nprovide significant oversight into the relevant \naspects of how recipients spend Fund support. See, \ne.g., 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.622 (extensive rules regarding the \n\n47 \n \ncompetitive bidding process Rural Health Care \nprogram participants must undertake to request \nservices and select a provider); id. \u00a7\u00a7 54.801-806 \n(rules \nregarding \ncompetitive \nbidding, \ncoverage \nobligations, reporting requirements, and more for \nRural Digital Opportunity Fund in High Cost \nprogram). The Administrator\u2019s work also is subject to \nindependent audit (with the participation of the \nFCC\u2019s Office of Managing Director). See id. \u00a7 54.717. \nC. The Fifth Circuit also stated that Section 254 \n\u201cdoes not authorize\u201d the role the FCC has assigned to \nthe Administrator. Pet. App. 55a. It acknowledged, \nhowever, that the challengers did not bring a \nstatutory claim. Id. at 63a & n.21. It also recognized \nthat its concerns regarding statutory authorization \ndo not apply to delegations of \u201cministerial tasks.\u201d \nId. at 56a-58a. \nAs \ndiscussed \nabove, \nthe \nAdministrator\u2019s role is ministerial\u2014the FCC adopts \nthe contribution factor, and the Administrator\u2019s role \nis \nlimited \nto \nproviding \ninputs \ninto \nthat \ndetermination, \nsubject \nto \nFCC \napproval \nand \nnumerous forms of supervision. Whether Section 254 \nor other provisions of the Communications Act \nauthorize \nthe \nFCC \nto \nassign \ntasks \nto \nthe \nAdministrator is therefore immaterial to deciding the \nprivate nondelegation issue in this case.48 \nIV. The Court Should Reject the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \n\u201cCombination\u201d Approach. \nDespite its concerns regarding the public and \nprivate nondelegation issues, the Fifth Circuit \n \n48 In any event, in responding to such a statutory \nchallenge, the FCC may point to 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 154(i), \n201(b), and other provisions. \n\n48 \n \nconcluded that it \u201cneed not resolve either question in \nthis case\u201d because, in its view, \u201cthe combination of \nCongress\u2019s sweeping delegation to FCC and FCC\u2019s \nunauthorized subdelegation to USAC violates the \nLegislative Vesting Clause in Article I, \u00a7 1.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 64a.  \nA. As discussed above, the majority\u2019s reasons for \nbeing \u201chighly skeptical,\u201d Pet. App. 64a, of Congress\u2019s \ndelegation to the FCC are without merit. Rather, as \nthe principal dissent concluded, the text and context \nof Section 254 establish \u201ca clear intelligible principle \ndelimiting agency discretion.\u201d Id. at 97a. Likewise, \nthe court of appeals\u2019 reasons for being \u201cskeptical\u201d of \nthe FCC\u2019s use of the Administrator in a subordinate \ncapacity do not survive scrutiny. Rather, as Judge \nStewart put it in dissent, the majority adopted an \n\u201cexaggerated \nconception \nof \nUSAC\u2019s \nrole \nand \ndiscretion to create a private nondelegation doctrine \nproblem where none exists.\u201d Id. at 103a. The \ncombination of these two non-violations is not \nproblematic.  \nB. In addition, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s approach is \ninconsistent \nwith \nhow \nthis \nCourt \naddressed \nchallenges in Sunshine Anthracite, Currin, and other \ncases. \nSunshine Anthracite\u2014like this case\u2014involved \nboth public and private nondelegation claims. Yet, \nthis Court addressed those issues individually, \nrather than assessing the \u201ccombination\u201d of the two \nissues as the Fifth Circuit would. The Court first \nconcluded that Congress\u2019s authorization for the \nNational Bituminous Coal Commission to \u201cfix \nminimum prices\u201d and \u201cestablish maximum prices\u201d for \nmembers of the \u201cBituminous Coal Code\u201d was \npermissible, holding that \u201cin the hands of experts the \n\n49 \n \ncriteria which Congress has supplied are wholly \nadequate.\u201d 310 U.S. at 388-89, 397-98. Separately, \nthe Court concluded that \u201claw-making is not \nentrusted to the industry.\u201d Id. at 399. Were the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s approach correct, the Court would have \ngone \non \nto \nconsider \nwhether, \nwhile \n\u201cnot \nindependently unconstitutional,\u201d the alleged public \nand private nondelegation problems nonetheless \n\u201ccombine[d] to violate the Constitution\u2019s separation \nof powers.\u201d Pet. App. 64a.  \nCurrin likewise considered both public and \nprivate nondelegation issues. Congress authorized \nthe Secretary of Agriculture to designate markets \nwhere standards for tobacco would apply, subject to \nthe condition that growers in that market vote in \nfavor. See 306 U.S. at 6. The Court separately \nconsidered whether that scheme \u201cinvolve[d] any \ndelegation of legislative authority\u201d to the \u201cgrowers of \ntobacco,\u201d and concluded it did not. Id. at 15. The \nCourt \nthen \nconcluded \nthere \nwas \nalso \nno \n\u201cunconstitutional delegation to the Secretary of \nAgriculture.\u201d Id. at 16. The Court did not consider \nwhether the combination of those features separately \nviolated the separation of powers. \nThe \nFifth \nCircuit\u2019s \nattempt \nto \ndistinguish \nSunshine Anthracite and Currin because \u201cthe Court \nfound the Government had not delegated any \nlegislative power to any private entity\u201d fails. Pet. \nApp. 78a-79a. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s \u201ccombination\u201d \napproach was necessary in this case because that \ncourt did not hold that Section 254 or the FCC\u2019s \nadministration of the Fund violates either the public \nor \nprivate \nnondelegation \ndoctrine. \nSunshine \nAnthracite and Currin similarly rejected both public \nand private nondelegation challenges. The Fifth \n\n50 \n \nCircuit\u2019s approach thus would have called for an \nanalysis \nwhether \nthe \n\u201cnot \nindependently \nunconstitutional\u201d \nparts, \nid. \nat \n64a, \nwere \nan \nunconstitutional whole.  \nBeyond the specific context of public and private \nnondelegation challenges, this Court has often \nconsidered multiple separation-of-powers challenges \n(and other constitutional challenges) in the same \ncase. As in Sunshine Anthracite, the Court did not \nanalyze whether a \u201ccombination\u201d of non-violations \ntogether amounted to a constitutional violation. \nIn Mistretta, for example, prisoners challenging \nthe \nconstitutionality \nof \nthe \nU.S. \nSentencing \nCommission raised several \u201cseparation of powers\u201d \nconcerns, in addition to arguing that \u201cCongress [had] \ndelegated excessive authority to the Commission to \nstructure the [Sentencing] Guidelines.\u201d 488 U.S. at \n370. This Court first addressed and rejected the \nnondelegation \ndoctrine \nchallenge, \neven \nwhile \nagreeing that the Sentencing Commission \u201cenjoys \nsignificant discretion in formulating guidelines.\u201d Id. \nat 377. \u201cHaving determined\u201d that the nondelegation \nchallenge failed, the Court \u201cturn[ed] to\u201d the multiple \ndistinct separation-of-powers challenges regarding \nthe \n\u201c[l]ocation\u201d \nand \n\u201c[c]omposition\u201d \nof \nthe \nCommission and the President\u2019s ability to \u201cremove\u201d \nits members. Id. at 380, 384, 397, 409. Contrary to \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s approach here, the Court \naddressed the nondelegation doctrine issues and \neach of the purported separation-of-powers violations \nseparately, \nwithout \nconsidering \nwhether \nthe \ncombination of these independently constitutional \n\n51 \n \nfacets might together violate the Constitution. See, \ne.g., id. at 381-411.49 \nC. Neither Seila Law nor Free Enterprise Fund \nrequires that courts assess the \u201ccombination\u201d of \nmultiple, individually constitutional, aspects of any \nchallenged statutory or regulatory scheme. Both \ncases addressed a particular separation-of-powers \nquestion not at issue here: what restrictions on the \nPresident\u2019s \nauthority \nto \nremove \nofficers \nare \npermissible, \nconsistent \nwith \nthe \nConstitution\u2019s \nvesting of the \u201cexecutive Power\u201d in the President. See \nSeila Law, 591 U.S. at 227 (quoting Free Enter. \nFund, 561 U.S. at 483).  \nThe removal question at issue in Seila Law was \nwhether the single head of an \u201cagency that wields \nsignificant executive power\u201d could constitutionally \nenjoy protection from at-will removal by the \nPresident. 591 U.S. at 204. While Humphrey\u2019s \nExecutor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602 (1935), had \napproved removal protections for \u201cmultimember \n \n49 See also, e.g., Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 660 \n(1988) (considering whether provisions governing the \nfunction \nof \nan \nindependent \ncounsel \nviolated \nthe \nAppointments Clause of Article II or the \u201climitations of \nArticle III\u201d or otherwise \u201cimpermissibly interfere[d] with \nthe President\u2019s authority under Article II in violation of \nthe constitutional separation of powers); Yakus, 321 U.S. \nat \n418 \n(considering \nmultiple \nconstitutional \nissues \nalongside \na \npublic \nnondelegation \nchallenge); \nJ.W. \nHampton, Jr., 276 U.S. at 404-07, 411-13  (considering \nchallenges to both (1) Congress\u2019s grant of authority to the \nPresident to impose customs duties on certain goods and \n(2) whether such customs duties could be imposed for a \npurpose other than raising revenue).  \n\n52 \n \nexpert agencies that do not wield substantial \nexecutive power\u201d and Morrison had approved \nremoval protection for \u201cinferior officers with limited \nduties,\u201d the head of the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau fit neither description, and the \nCourt was unwilling to \u201cextend those precedents to \nth[is] \u2018new situation.\u2019\u201d 591 U.S. at 216-20. Thus, as \nJudge Higginson explained in dissent, the Court \nsimply \u201capplied precedent\u201d and \u201cdeclined to create a \nnew\u201d \nexception \nto \nthe \nPresident\u2019s \n\u201cotherwise \n\u2018unrestricted removal power.\u2019\u201d Pet. App. 117a \n(quoting Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 204).  \nNor did Free Enterprise Fund establish an \napproach \nthat \nsupports \nthe \nFifth \nCircuit\u2019s \ncombination theory. In that removal case, the \nstatutory scheme provided that members of the \nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board were \n\u201csubstantially insulated from the [Securities and \nExchange] \nCommission\u2019s \ncontrol,\u201d \nand \nSEC \ncommissioners were also understood to be protected \nfrom at-will removal. 561 U.S. at 486-87. For that \nreason, the Court was required to \u201cconsider a new \nsituation not yet encountered\u201d in its line of \nprecedents on removal authority\u2014\u201cwhether these \nseparate layers of protection may be combined.\u201d Id. \nat 483. \nBecause \nthe \n\u201cadded \nlayer \nof \ntenure \nprotection\u201d meant that the \u201cPresident is stripped of \nthe power [the Court\u2019s] precedents have preserved,\u201d \nthe Court struck it down. Id. at 495-96; see also id. at \n514 (\u201cWhile we have sustained in certain cases limits \non the President\u2019s removal power, the Act before us \nimposes a new type of restriction \u2026 .\u201d). \nContrary to the Fifth Circuit\u2019s reading, however, \nFree Enterprise Fund did not purport to announce a \n\u201cgeneral principle\u201d extending beyond a challenge to \n\n53 \n \nmultiple layers of removal protection. Pet. App. 66a. \nIndeed, Free Enterprise Fund itself also involved \nseveral additional challenges to the Board \u201cunder the \nAppointments Clause,\u201d 561 U.S. at 510, each of \nwhich \nthe \nCourt \nconsidered \nand \nrejected \nindependently, without considering whether their \ncombination \nmight \nnonetheless \nviolate \nthe \nConstitution.  \nMoreover, \nremoval \nissues \nare \nsignificantly \ndifferent from nondelegation issues. As this Court \nexplained, on account of the \u201csecond level of tenure \nprotection\u201d at issue in Free Enterprise Fund, \n\u201c[n]either \nthe \nPresident, \nnor \nanyone \ndirectly \nresponsible to him, nor even an officer whose conduct \nhe may review only for good cause, ha[d] full control \nover the Board.\u201d 561 U.S. at 496. Thus, even if both \nlevels of tenure protection were acceptable by \nthemselves, as was the case in Free Enterprise Fund, \nthey combined to create a structure that necessarily \nlimited the President\u2019s authority beyond permissible \nbounds.  \nIn \ncontrast, \nthere \nis \nnothing \ninherently \nproblematic about Congress delegating to an agency \nand the agency separately relying on another entity \nfor \nsome \nfunctions, \nsubject \nto \nthe \nagency\u2019s \nsupervision. Even assuming arguendo that the FCC \nis not adequately supervising the Administrator, the \nFCC retains full authority to do so.  Accordingly, this \nis not a case where \u201ceven\u201d officials \u201cwhose conduct \n[the President] may review only for good cause\u201d lack \ncontrol over the Administrator. Id. And if a court \nwere to determine that some agency lacked full \ncontrol over the entity to which it delegated \nauthority, the appropriate remedy would be to \ncorrect the impermissible delegation. \n\n54 \n \nFinally, the harm in removal cases is cumulative, \nwhile the harm in public and private nondelegation \ncases is not. That is, each layer of tenure protection \nlimits \nthe \nPresident\u2019s \nability \nto \ncontrol \nhis \nsubordinates\u2014each layer\u2019s harm is the same, with \ncumulative effect. In contrast, the harms in public \nnondelegation cases (Congress\u2019s improper delegation \nof its legislative powers) and the harm in private \nnondelegation \ncases \n(an \nagency\u2019s \nimproper \ndelegation of government power to private actors) \nare distinct and non-cumulative. Therefore, for \nexample, a grant of authority by Congress that \nsatisfies the public nondelegation doctrine is not \naffected by an agency\u2019s impermissible delegation of \nnon-ministerial duties to a private party.  \nD. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s approach also would create \nserious workability problems, which in turn would \nlead to confusion in the lower courts. Most notably, \nthe Fifth Circuit \u201coffers no test\u201d for adjudicating \nsituations \ninvolving \nauthorization \nfor \nboth \ngovernment agencies and private parties providing \nministerial support, Pet. App. 123a (Higginson, J., \ndissenting), let alone other separation-of-powers \ncontexts. Neither Free Enterprise Fund nor Seila \nLaw offered one, as neither case spoke so broadly as \nthe Fifth Circuit concluded they did.  \nIndeed, \nthis \nCourt \nhas \nraised \nworkability \nconcerns regarding such an interpretation of Seila \nLaw, \nrejecting \nthe \nargument \nthat \n\u201cthe \nconstitutionality of removal restrictions hinges on\u201d \nthe \u201crelative importance of the regulatory and \nenforcement authority of disparate agencies.\u201d Collins \nv. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220, 253 (2021). \u201cCourts are not \nwell-suited to weigh\u201d such matters. Id. Yet, the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s approach would require courts to go far \n\n55 \n \nbeyond \nsuch \nissues, \nweighing \nthe \n\u201crelative \nimportance\u201d of various constitutional aspects of \nvarious \nstatutory \nor \nregulatory \nschemes \nfor \ndetermining whether their combination exceeds a \nthus-far undefined limit.  \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the Fifth Circuit should be \nreversed.  \n \n \nAndrew Jay Schwartzman \n525 9th Street NW, 7th Fl. \nWashington, DC 20004 \n(202) 241-2408 \nAndySchwartzman \n@gmail.com \n \nCounsel for Benton \nInstitute, NDIA, and \nMediaJustice \n \n \n \nJANUARY 9, 2025 \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nChristopher J.

Every distinct violation \nshall be a separate offense, and in case of continuing \nviolation each day shall be deemed a separate offense. \n \n \n\n7a \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 214 provides, in relevant part: \nExtension of lines or discontinuance of service; \ncertificate of public convenience and necessity \n[\u2026] \n(e) Provision of universal service \n(1) Eligible telecommunications carriers \n \nA common carrier designated as an eligible tele-\ncommunications carrier under paragraph (2), (3), or \n(6) shall be eligible to receive universal service sup-\nport in accordance with section 254 of this title and \nshall, throughout the service area for which the desig-\nnation is received\u2014 \n(A) offer the services that are supported by \nFederal universal service support mechanisms \nunder section 254(c) of this title, either using \nits own facilities or a combination of its own fa-\ncilities and resale of another carrier\u2019s services \n(including the services offered by another eligi-\nble telecommunications carrier); and \n(B) advertise the availability of such ser-\nvices and the charges therefor using media of \ngeneral distribution. \n(2) Designation of eligible telecommunica-\ntions carriers \n \nA State commission shall upon its own motion or \nupon request designate a common carrier that meets \nthe requirements of paragraph (1) as an eligible tele-\ncommunications carrier for a service area designated \nby the State commission. Upon request and consistent \nwith the public interest, convenience, and necessity, \nthe State commission may, in the case of an area \nserved by a rural telephone company, and shall, in the \n\n8a \ncase of all other areas, designate more than one com-\nmon carrier as an eligible telecommunications carrier \nfor a service area designated by the State commission, \nso long as each additional requesting carrier meets \nthe requirements of paragraph (1). Before designating \nan additional eligible telecommunications carrier for \nan area served by a rural telephone company, the \nState commission shall find that the designation is in \nthe public interest. \n(3) Designation of eligible telecommunica-\ntions carriers for unserved areas \n \nIf no common carrier will provide the services that \nare supported by Federal universal service support \nmechanisms under section 254(c) of this title to an un-\nserved community or any portion thereof that re-\nquests such service, the Commission, with respect to \ninterstate services or an area served by a common car-\nrier to which paragraph (6) applies, or a State com-\nmission, with respect to intrastate services, shall de-\ntermine which common carrier or carriers are best \nable to provide such service to the requesting un-\nserved community or portion thereof and shall order \nsuch carrier or carriers to provide such service for that \nunserved community or portion thereof. Any carrier or \ncarriers ordered to provide such service under this \nparagraph shall meet the requirements of paragraph \n(1) and shall be designated as an eligible telecommu-\nnications carrier for that community or portion \nthereof. \n(4) Relinquishment of universal service \n \nA State commission (or the Commission in the case \nof a common carrier designated under paragraph (6)) \nshall permit an eligible telecommunications carrier to \nrelinquish its designation as such a carrier in any area \n\n9a \nserved by more than one eligible telecommunications \ncarrier.

Prior to per-\nmitting a telecommunications carrier designated as \nan eligible telecommunications carrier to cease \nproviding universal service in an area served by more \nthan one eligible telecommunications carrier, the \nState commission (or the Commission in the case of a \ncommon carrier designated under paragraph (6)) shall \nrequire the remaining eligible telecommunications \ncarrier or carriers to ensure that all customers served \nby the relinquishing carrier will continue to be served, \nand shall require sufficient notice to permit the pur-\nchase or construction of adequate facilities by any re-\nmaining eligible telecommunications carrier. The \nState commission (or the Commission in the case of a \ncommon carrier designated under paragraph (6)) shall \nestablish a time, not to exceed one year after the State \ncommission (or the Commission in the case of a com-\nmon carrier designated under paragraph (6)) approves \nsuch relinquishment under this paragraph, within \nwhich such purchase or construction shall be com-\npleted. \n(5) \u201cService area\u201d defined \n \nThe term \u201cservice area\u201d means a geographic area \nestablished by a State commission (or the Commission \nunder paragraph (6)) for the purpose of determining \nuniversal service obligations and support mecha-\nnisms. In the case of an area served by a rural tele-\nphone company, \u201cservice area\u201d means such company\u2019s \n\n10a \n\u201cstudy area\u201d unless and until the Commission and the \nStates, after taking into account recommendations of \na Federal-State Joint Board instituted under section \n410(c) of this title, establish a different definition of \nservice area for such company. \n(6) Common carriers not subject to State \ncommission jurisdiction \n \nIn the case of a common carrier providing tele-\nphone exchange service and exchange access that is \nnot subject to the jurisdiction of a State commission, \nthe Commission shall upon request designate such a \ncommon carrier that meets the requirements of para-\ngraph (1) as an eligible telecommunications carrier for \na service area designated by the Commission con-\nsistent with applicable Federal and State law. Upon \nrequest and consistent with the public interest, con-\nvenience and necessity, the Commission may, with re-\nspect to an area served by a rural telephone company, \nand shall, in the case of all other areas, designate \nmore than one common carrier as an eligible telecom-\nmunications carrier for a service area designated un-\nder this paragraph, so long as each additional request-\ning carrier meets the requirements of paragraph (1). \nBefore designating an additional eligible telecommu-\nnications carrier for an area served by a rural tele-\nphone company, the Commission shall find that the \ndesignation is in the public interest. \n \n \n\n11a \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 252 provides, in relevant part: \nProcedures for negotiation, arbitration, and \napproval of agreements \n[\u2026] \n(d) Pricing standards \n(1) Interconnection and network element \ncharges \nDeterminations by a State commission of the \njust and reasonable rate for the interconnection of \nfacilities and equipment for purposes of subsection \n(c)(2) of section 251 of this title, and the just and \nreasonable rate for network elements for purposes \nof subsection (c)(3) of such section\u2014 \n(A) shall be\u2014 \n(i) based on the cost (determined with-\nout reference to a rate-of-return or other \nrate-based proceeding) of providing the in-\nterconnection or network element (which-\never is applicable), and \n(ii) nondiscriminatory, and \n(B) may include a reasonable profit. \n \n \n\n12a \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254 provides: \nUniversal service \n(a) Procedures to review universal service re-\nquirements \n(1) Federal-State Joint Board on universal \nservice \nWithin one month after February 8, 1996, the \nCommission shall institute and refer to a Federal-\nState Joint Board under section 410(c) of this title a \nproceeding to recommend changes to any of its regu-\nlations in order to implement sections 214(e) of this \ntitle and this section, including the definition of the \nservices that are supported by Federal universal ser \nvice support mechanisms and a specific timetable for \ncompletion of such recommendations. In addition to \nthe members of the Joint Board required under sec-\ntion 410(c) of this title, one member of such Joint \nBoard shall be a State-appointed utility consumer ad-\nvocate nominated by a national organization of State \nutility consumer advocates. The Joint Board shall, af-\nter notice and opportunity for public comment, make \nits recommendations to the Commission 9 months af-\nter February 8, 1996. \n(2) Commission action \nThe Commission shall initiate a single proceeding \nto implement the recommendations from the Joint \nBoard required by paragraph (1) and shall complete \nsuch proceeding within 15 months after February 8, \n1996. The rules established by such proceeding shall \ninclude a definition of the services that are supported \nby Federal universal service support mechanisms and \na specific timetable for implementation. Thereafter, \nthe Commission shall complete any proceeding to \n\n13a \nimplement subsequent recommendations from any \nJoint Board on universal service within one year after \nreceiving such recommendations. \n(b) Universal service principles \nThe Joint Board and the Commission shall base \npolicies for the preservation and advancement of uni-\nversal service on the following principles: \n(1) Quality and rates \nQuality services should be available at just, rea-\nsonable, and affordable rates. \n(2) Access to advanced services \nAccess to advanced telecommunications and infor-\nmation services should be provided in all regions of \nthe Nation. \n(3) Access in rural and high cost areas \nConsumers in all regions of the Nation, including \nlow-income consumers and those in rural, insular, and \nhigh cost areas, should have access to telecommunica-\ntions and information services, including interex-\nchange services and advanced telecommunications \nand information services, that are reasonably compa-\nrable to those services provided in urban areas and \nthat are available at rates that are reasonably compa-\nrable to rates charged for similar services in urban ar-\neas. \n(4) Equitable and nondiscriminatory con-\ntributions \nAll providers of telecommunications services \nshould make an equitable and nondiscriminatory con-\ntribution to the preservation and advancement of uni-\nversal service. \n\n14a \n(5) Specific and predictable support mech-\nanisms \nThere should be specific, predictable and sufficient \nFederal and State mechanisms to preserve and ad-\nvance universal service. \n(6) Access to advanced telecommunications \nservices for schools, health care, and li-\nbraries \nElementary and secondary schools and class-\nrooms, health care providers, and libraries should \nhave access to advanced telecommunications services \nas described in subsection (h). \n(7) Additional principles \nSuch other principles as the Joint Board and the \nCommission determine are necessary and appropriate \nfor the protection of the public interest, convenience, \nand necessity and are consistent with this chapter. \n(c) Definition \n(1) In general \nUniversal service is an evolving level of telecom-\nmunications services that the Commission shall es-\ntablish periodically under this section, taking into ac-\ncount advances in telecommunications and infor-\nmation technologies and services. The Joint Board in \nrecommending, and the Commission in establishing, \nthe definition of the services that are supported by \nFederal universal service support mechanisms shall \nconsider the extent to which such telecommunications \nservices\u2014 \n(A) are essential to education, public health, \nor public safety; \n(B) have, through the operation of market \n\n15a \nchoices by customers, been subscribed to by a sub-\nstantial majority of residential customers; \n(C) are being deployed in public telecommuni-\ncations networks by telecommunications carriers; \nand \n(D) are consistent with the public interest, \nconvenience, and necessity. \n(2) Alterations and modifications \nThe Joint Board may, from time to time, recom-\nmend to the Commission modifications in the defini-\ntion of the services that are supported by Federal uni-\nversal service support mechanisms. \n(3) Special services \nIn addition to the services included in the defini-\ntion of universal service under paragraph (1), the \nCommission may designate additional services for \nsuch support mechanisms for schools, libraries, and \nhealth care providers for the purposes of subsection \n(h). \n(d) Telecommunications carrier contribution \nEvery telecommunications carrier that provides \ninterstate telecommunications services shall contrib-\nute, on an equitable and nondiscriminatory basis, to \nthe specific, predictable, and sufficient mechanisms \nestablished by the Commission to preserve and ad-\nvance universal service. The Commission may exempt \na carrier or class of carriers from this requirement if \nthe carrier\u2019s telecommunications activities are limited \nto such an extent that the level of such carrier\u2019s con-\ntribution to the preservation and advancement of uni-\nversal service would be de minimis. Any other pro-\nvider of interstate telecommunications may be re-\nquired to contribute to the preservation and \n\n16a \nadvancement of universal service if the public interest \nso requires. \n(e) Universal service support \nAfter the date on which Commission regulations \nimplementing this section take effect, only an eligible \ntelecommunications carrier designated under section \n214(e) of this title shall be eligible to receive specific \nFederal universal service support. A carrier that re-\nceives such support shall use that support only for the \nprovision, maintenance, and upgrading of facilities \nand services for which the support is intended. Any \nsuch support should be explicit and sufficient to \nachieve the purposes of this section. \n(f) \nState authority \nA State may adopt regulations not inconsistent \nwith the Commission\u2019s rules to preserve and advance \nuniversal service. Every telecommunications carrier \nthat provides intrastate telecommunications services \nshall contribute, on an equitable and nondiscrimina-\ntory basis, in a manner determined by the State to the \npreservation and advancement of universal service in \nthat State.

If the subscriber\u2019s eligibility was previously \nconfirmed through an eligibility database during \nenrollment or a prior recertification and the sub-\nscriber is no longer included in any eligibility da-\ntabase, the eligible telecommunications carrier \nmust obtain both an Annual Recertification Form \nand documentation meeting the requirements of \nparagraph (b)(1)(i)(B) or (c)(1)(i)(B) from that sub-\nscriber to complete the process. Eligible telecom-\nmunications carriers must use the Wireline Com-\npetition Bureau-approved universal Annual Recer-\ntification Form, except where state law, state reg-\nulation, a state Lifeline administrator, or a state \nagency requires eligible telecommunications carri-\ners to use state-specific Lifeline recertification \nforms. \n \n(iv) In states in which the National Verifier has \nbeen implemented, the eligible telecommunica-\ntions carrier cannot re-certify subscribers not \nfound in the National Verifier by obtaining a certi-\nfication form from the subscriber. \n \n(3) Where the National Verifier, state Lifeline ad-\nministrator, or other state agency is responsible for re-\ncertification of a subscriber\u2019s Lifeline eligibility, the \nNational Verifier, state Lifeline administrator, or \nstate agency must confirm a subscriber\u2019s current eli-\ngibility to receive a Lifeline service by: \n \n(i) Querying the appropriate eligibility data-\nbases, confirming that the subscriber still meets \nthe program-based eligibility requirements for \n\n57a \nLifeline, and documenting the results of that re-\nview; or \n \n(ii) Querying the appropriate income data-\nbases, confirming that the subscriber continues to \nmeet the income-based eligibility requirements for \nLifeline, and documenting the results of that re-\nview. \n \n(iii) If the subscriber\u2019s program-based or in-\ncome-based eligibility for Lifeline cannot be deter-\nmined by accessing one or more eligibility data-\nbases, then the National Verifier, state Lifeline ad-\nministrator, or state agency must obtain a signed \ncertification from the subscriber confirming the \nsubscriber\u2019s continued eligibility. If the sub-\nscriber\u2019s eligibility was previously confirmed \nthrough an eligibility database during enrollment \nor a prior recertification and the subscriber is no \nlonger included in any eligibility database, the Na-\ntional Verifier, state Lifeline administrator, or \nstate agency must obtain both an approved Annual \nRecertification Form and documentation meeting \nthe requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i)(B) or \n(c)(1)(i)(B) from that subscriber to complete the \ncertification process. Entities responsible for re-\ncertification under this section must use the Wire-\nline Competition Bureau-approved universal An-\nnual Recertification Form, except where state law, \nstate regulation, a state Lifeline administrator, or \na state agency requires eligible telecommunica-\ntions carriers to use state-specific Lifeline recerti-\nfication forms, or where the National Verifier \nRecertification Form is required. \n \n(4) Where the National Verifier, state Lifeline ad-\nministrator, or other state agency is responsible for re-\ncertification of subscribers\u2019 Lifeline eligibility, the \n\n58a \nNational Verifier, state Lifeline administrator, or \nother state agency must provide to each eligible tele-\ncommunications carrier the results of its annual re-\ncertification efforts with respect to that eligible tele-\ncommunications carrier\u2019s subscribers. \n \n(5) If an eligible telecommunications carrier is un-\nable to re-certify a subscriber or has been notified by \nthe National Verifier, a state Lifeline administrator, \nor other state agency that it is unable to re-certify a \nsubscriber, the eligible telecommunications carrier \nmust comply with the de-enrollment requirements \nprovided for in \u00a7 54.405(e)(4). \n(g) One-Per-Household Worksheet. If the prospec-\ntive subscriber shares an address with one or more ex-\nisting Lifeline subscribers according to the National \nLifeline Accountability Database or National Verifier, \nthe prospective subscriber must complete a form cer-\ntifying compliance with the one-per-household rule \nupon initial enrollment. Eligible telecommunications \ncarriers must fulfill the requirement in this para-\ngraph (g) by using the Household Worksheet, as pro-\nvided by the Wireline Competition Bureau. Where \nstate law, state regulation, a state Lifeline adminis-\ntrator, or a state agency requires eligible telecommu-\nnications carriers to use state-specific Lifeline enroll-\nment forms, eligible telecommunications carriers may \nuse those forms in place of the Commission\u2019s House-\nhold Worksheet. At re-certification, if there are \nchanges to the subscriber\u2019s household that would pre-\nvent the subscriber from accurately certifying to par-\nagraph (d)(3)(vi) of this section, then the subscriber \nmust complete a new Household Worksheet. Eligible \ntelecommunications carriers must mark subscribers \nas having completed a Household Worksheet in the \nNational Lifeline Accountability Database if and only \n\n59a \nif the subscriber shares an address with an existing \nLifeline subscriber, as reported by the National Life-\nline Accountability Database. \n(h) National Verifier transition.

All survivors \nseeking to receive emergency communications sup-\nport from the Lifeline program must have their eligi-\nbility to participate in the program confirmed through \nthe National Verifier. The National Verifier will also \ntransition survivors approaching the end of their six-\nmonth emergency support period in a manner con-\nsistent with the requirements applied to eligible tele-\ncommunications carriers at paragraph (f) of this sec-\ntion, and the National Verifier will de-enroll survivors \nwhose continued eligibility to participate in the Life-\nline program cannot be confirmed, consistent with \n\u00a7 54.405(e)(6). \n \n\n60a \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.500 provides, in relevant part: \nTerms and definitions. \n[\u2026] \nLowest corresponding price. \u201cLowest corresponding \nprice\u201d is the lowest price that a service provider \ncharges to non-residential customers who are simi-\nlarly situated to a particular school, library, or library \nconsortium for similar services. \n \n \n\n61a \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.507 provides: \nCap. \n(a) Amount of the annual cap. The aggregate an-\nnual cap on federal universal service support for \nschools and libraries shall be $3.9 billion per funding \nyear, of which $1 billion per funding year will be avail-\nable for category two services, as described in \n\u00a7 54.502(a)(2), unless demand for category one ser-\nvices is higher than available funding. \n \n(1) Inflation increase. In funding year 2016 and \nsubsequent funding years, the $3.9 billion funding cap \non federal universal service support for schools and li-\nbraries shall be automatically increased annually to \ntake into account increases in the rate of inflation as \ncalculated in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. \n \n(2) Increase calculation. To measure increases \nin the rate of inflation for the purposes of this para-\ngraph (a), the Commission shall use the Gross Domes-\ntic Product Chain-type Price Index (GDP-CPI). To \ncompute the annual increase as required by this par-\nagraph (a), the percentage increase in the GDP-CPI \nfrom the previous year will be used. For instance, the \nannual increase in the GDP-CPI from 2008 to 2009 \nwould be used for the 2010 funding year. The increase \nshall be rounded to the nearest 0.1 percent by round-\ning 0.05 percent and above to the next higher 0.1 per-\ncent and otherwise rounding to the next lower 0.1 per-\ncent. This percentage increase shall be added to the \namount of the annual funding cap from the previous \nfunding year. If the yearly average GDP-CPI de-\ncreases or stays the same, the annual funding cap \nshall remain the same as the previous year. \n\n62a \n \n(3) Public notice. When the calculation of the \nyearly average GDP-CPI is determined, the Wireline \nCompetition Bureau shall publish a public notice in \nthe FEDERAL REGISTER within 60 days announcing \nany increase of the annual funding cap including any \nincrease to the $1 billion funding level available for \ncategory two services based on the rate of inflation. \n \n(4) Filing window requests. At the close of the \nfiling window, if requests for category one services are \ngreater than the available funding, the Administrator \nshall shift category two funds to provide support for \ncategory one services. If available funds are sufficient \nto meet demand for category one services, the Admin-\nistrator, at the direction of the Wireline Competition \nBureau, shall direct the remaining additional funds to \nprovide support for category two requests. \n \n(5) Amount of unused funds. All funds collected \nthat are unused shall be carried forward into subse-\nquent funding years for use in the schools and librar-\nies support mechanism in accordance with the public \ninterest and notwithstanding the annual cap. The \nChief, Wireline Competition Bureau, is delegated au-\nthority to determine the proportion of unused funds, \nif any, needed to meet category one demand, and to \ndirect the Administrator to use any remaining funds \nto provide support for category two requests. The Ad-\nministrator shall report to the Commission, on a quar-\nterly basis, funding that is unused from prior years of \nthe schools and libraries support mechanism. \n \n(6) Application of unused funds. On an annual \nbasis, in the second quarter of each calendar year, all \nfunds that are collected and that are unused from \nprior years shall be available for use in the next full \nfunding year of the schools and libraries mechanism \nin \naccordance \nwith \nthe \npublic \ninterest \nand \n\n63a \nnotwithstanding the annual cap as described in this \nparagraph (a). \n(b) Funding year. A funding year for purposes of the \nschools and libraries cap shall be the period July 1 \nthrough June 30. \n(c) Requests. The Administrator shall implement an \ninitial filing period that treats all schools and libraries \nfiling an application within that period as if their ap-\nplications were simultaneously received. The initial \nfiling period shall begin and conclude on dates to be \ndetermined by the Administrator with the approval of \nthe Chief of the Wireline Competition Bureau. The \nAdministrator shall maintain on the Administrator\u2019s \nWeb site a running tally of the funds already commit-\nted for the existing funding year. The Administrator \nmay implement such additional filing periods as it \ndeems necessary. \n(d) Annual filing requirement. \n \n(1) Schools and libraries, and consortia of such eli-\ngible entities shall file new funding requests for each \nfunding year no sooner than the July 1 prior to the \nstart of that funding year. Schools, libraries, and eli-\ngible consortia must use recurring services for which \ndiscounts have been committed by the Administrator \nwithin the funding year for which the discounts were \nsought. \n \n(2) Installation of category one non-recurring ser-\nvices may begin on January 1 prior to the July 1 start \nof the funding year, provided the following conditions \nare met: \n \n(i) Construction begins after selection of the \nservice provider pursuant to a posted FCC Form \n470, \n\n64a \n \n(ii) A category one recurring service must de-\npend on the installation of the infrastructure, and \n \n(iii) The actual service start date for that recur-\nring service is on or after the start of the funding \nyear (July 1). \n(3) Installation of category two non-recurring ser-\nvices may begin on April 1 prior to the July 1 start of \nthe funding year. \n(4) The deadline for implementation of all non-re-\ncurring services will be September 30 following the \nclose of the funding year. An applicant may request \nand receive from the Administrator an extension of \nthe implementation deadline for non-recurring ser-\nvices if it satisfies one of the following criteria: \n(i) The applicant\u2019s funding commitment deci-\nsion letter is issued by the Administrator on or af-\nter March 1 of the funding year for which discounts \nare authorized; \n(ii) The applicant receives a service provider \nchange authorization or service substitution au-\nthorization from the Administrator on or after \nMarch 1 of the funding year for which discounts \nare authorized; \n(iii) The applicant\u2019s service provider is unable \nto complete implementation for reasons beyond the \nservice provider\u2019s control; or \n(iv) The applicant\u2019s service provider is unwill-\ning to complete installation because funding dis-\nbursements are delayed while the Administrator \ninvestigates the application for program compli-\nance. \n(e) Long term contracts. If schools and libraries en-\nter into long term contracts for eligible services, the \n\n65a \nAdministrator shall only commit funds to cover the \npro rata portion of such a long term contract sched-\nuled to be delivered during the funding year for which \nuniversal service support is sought. \n(f) Rules of distribution. When the filing period de-\nscribed in paragraph (c) of this section closes, the Ad-\nministrator shall calculate the total demand for both \ncategory one and category two support submitted by \napplicants during the filing period. If total demand for \nthe funding year exceeds the total support available \nfor category one or both categories, the Administrator \nshall take the following steps: \n \n(1) Category one. The Administrator shall first \ncalculate the demand for category one services for all \ndiscount levels. The Administrator shall allocate the \ncategory one funds to these requests for support, be-\nginning with the most economically disadvantaged \nschools and libraries, as determined by the schools \nand libraries discount matrix in \u00a7 54.505(c). Schools \nand libraries eligible for a 90 percent discount shall \nreceive first priority for the category one funds. The \nAdministrator shall next allocate funds toward the re-\nquests submitted by schools and libraries eligible for \nan 80 percent discount, then for a 70 percent discount, \nand shall continue committing funds for category one \nservices in the same manner to the applicants at each \ndescending discount level until there are no funds re-\nmaining. \n \n(2) Category two. The Administrator shall next \ncalculate the demand for category two services for all \ndiscount categories as determined by the schools and \nlibraries discount matrix in \u00a7 54.505(c). If that de-\nmand exceeds the category two budget for that fund-\ning year, the Administrator shall allocate the category \ntwo funds beginning with the most economically \n\n66a \ndisadvantaged schools and libraries, as determined by \nthe schools and libraries discount matrix in \n\u00a7 54.505(c). The Administrator shall allocate funds to-\nward the category two requests submitted by schools \nand libraries eligible for an 85 percent discount first, \nthen for a 80 percent discount, and shall continue \ncommitting funds in the same manner to the appli-\ncants at each descending discount level until there are \nno category two funds remaining. \n \n(3) To the extent that there are single discount per-\ncentage levels associated with \u201cshared services\u201d under \n\u00a7 54.505(b)(4), the Administrator shall allocate funds \nto the applicants at each descending discount level \n(e.g., 90 percent, 89 percent, then 88 percent) until \nthere are no funds remaining. \n \n(4) In the event that demand exceeds available \nfunding, requests for category one services used off-\npremises shall be funded after on-premises category \none and category two services. \n \n(5) For paragraphs (f)(1) through (4) of this section, \nif the remaining funds are not sufficient to support all \nof the funding requests within a particular discount \nlevel, the Administrator shall allocate funds at that \ndiscount level using the percentage of students eligi-\nble for the National School Lunch Program. Thus, if \nthere is not enough support to fund all requests at the \n40 percent discount level, the Administrator shall al-\nlocate funds beginning with those applicants with the \nhighest percentage of NSLP eligibility for that dis-\ncount level by funding those applicants with 19 per-\ncent NSLP eligibility, then 18 percent NSLP eligibil-\nity, and shall continue committing funds in the same \nmanner to applicants at each descending percentage \nof NSLP until there are no funds remaining. \n \n\n67a \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.511 provides: \nOrdering services. \n(a) Selecting a provider of eligible services. Ex-\ncept as exempted in \u00a7 54.503(e), in selecting a provider \nof eligible services, schools, libraries, library consor-\ntia, and consortia including any of those entities shall \ncarefully consider all bids submitted and must select \nthe most cost-effective service offering. In determin-\ning which service offering is the most cost-effective, \nentities may consider relevant factors other than the \npre-discount prices submitted by providers, but price \nshould be the primary factor considered. \n(b) Lowest corresponding price. Providers of eligi-\nble services shall not submit bids for or charge schools, \nschool districts, libraries, library consortia, or consor-\ntia including any of these entities a price above the \nlowest corresponding price for supported services, un-\nless the Commission, with respect to interstate ser-\nvices or the state commission with respect to intra-\nstate services, finds that the lowest corresponding \nprice is not compensatory. Promotional rates offered \nby a service provider for a period of more than 90 days \nmust be included among the comparable rates upon \nwhich the lowest corresponding price is determined. \n \n \n\n68a \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.603 provides: \nConsortia, telecommunications services, and \nexisting contracts. \n(a) Consortia. \n \n(1) Under the Telecommunications Program, an el-\nigible health care provider may join a consortium with \nother eligible health care providers; with schools, li-\nbraries, and library consortia eligible under subpart F \nof this part; and with public sector (governmental) en-\ntities to order telecommunications services. With one \nexception, eligible health care providers participating \nin consortia with ineligible private sector members \nshall not be eligible for supported services under this \nsubpart. A consortium may include ineligible private \nsector entities if such consortium is only receiving ser-\nvices at tariffed rates or at market rates from those \nproviders who do not file tariffs. \n \n(2) For consortia, universal service support under \nthe Telecommunications Program shall apply only to \nthe portion of eligible services used by an eligible \nhealth care provider. \n(b) Telecommunications services. Any telecommu-\nnications service that is the subject of a properly com-\npleted bona fide request by a rural health care pro-\nvider shall be eligible for universal service support. \nUpon submitting a bona fide request to a telecommu-\nnications carrier, each eligible rural health care pro-\nvider is entitled to receive the most cost-effective, com-\nmercially-available telecommunications service, and a \ntelecommunications service carrier that is eligible for \nsupport under the Telecommunications Program shall \nprovide such service at the urban rate, as defined in \n\u00a7 54.604. \n\n69a \n(c) Existing contracts. A signed contract for services \neligible for Telecommunications Program support \npursuant to this subpart between an eligible health \ncare provider, as defined under \u00a7 54.600, and a service \nprovider shall be exempt from the competitive bid re-\nquirements as set forth in \u00a7 54.622(i). \n \n \n\n70a \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.604 provides: \nDetermining the urban rate. \n(a) Effective funding year 2024: \n \n(1) If a rural health care provider requests support \nfor an eligible service to be funded from the Telecom-\nmunications Program that is to be provided over a dis-\ntance that is less than or equal to the \u201cstandard urban \ndistance,\u201d as defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this sec-\ntion, for the state in which it is located, the \u201curban \nrate\u201d for that service shall be a rate no higher than the \nhighest tariffed or publicly-available rate charged to a \ncommercial customer for a functionally similar service \nin any city with a population of 50,000 or more in that \nstate, calculated as if it were provided between two \npoints within the city. \n \n(2) If a rural health care provider requests an eli-\ngible service to be provided over a distance that is \ngreater than the \u201cstandard urban distance,\u201d as de-\nfined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, for the state \nin which it is located, the urban rate for that service \nshall be a rate no higher than the highest tariffed or \npublicly-available rate charged to a commercial cus-\ntomer for a functionally similar service provided over \nthe standard urban distance in any city with a popu-\nlation of 50,000 or more in that state, calculated as if \nthe service were provided between two points within \nthe city. \n \n(3) The \u201cstandard urban distance\u201d for a state is the \naverage of the longest diameters of all cities with a \npopulation of 50,000 or more within the state. \n \n(4) The Administrator shall calculate the \u201cstand-\nard urban distance\u201d and shall post the \u201cstandard ur-\nban distance\u201d and the maximum supported distance \n\n71a \nfor each state on its website. \n(b) As of funding year 2025, if a rural health care pro-\nvider requests support for an eligible service to be \nfunded from the Telecommunications Program the \n\u201curban rate\u201d for that service shall be a rate no higher \nthan the highest tariffed or publicly-available rate \ncharged to a commercial customer for a functionally \nsimilar service in any city with a population of 50,000 \nor more in that state, calculated as if it were provided \nbetween two points within the city. \n \n \n\n72a \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.605 provides: \nDetermining the rural rate. \n(a) Effective funding year 2024, the rural rate shall be \nthe average of the rates actually being charged to com-\nmercial customers, other than health care providers, \nfor identical or similar services provided by the tele-\ncommunications carrier providing the service in the \nrural area in which the health care provider is located. \nThe rates included in this average shall be for services \nprovided over the same distance as the eligible ser-\nvice. The rates averaged to calculate the rural rate \nmust not include any rates reduced by universal ser-\nvice support mechanisms. The \u201crural rate\u201d shall be \nused as described in this subpart to determine the \ncredit or reimbursement due to a telecommunications \ncarrier that provides eligible telecommunications ser-\nvices to eligible health care providers. \n(b) If the telecommunications carrier serving the \nhealth care provider is not providing any identical or \nsimilar services in the rural area, then the rural rate \nshall be the average of the tariffed and other publicly \navailable rates, not including any rates reduced by \nuniversal service programs, charged for the same or \nsimilar services in that rural area over the same dis-\ntance as the eligible service by other carriers. If there \nare no tariffed or publicly available rates for such ser-\nvices in that rural area, or if the carrier reasonably \ndetermines that this method for calculating the rural \nrate is unfair, then the carrier shall submit for the \nstate commission\u2019s approval, for intrastate rates, or \nfor the Commission\u2019s approval, for interstate rates, a \ncost-based rate for the provision of the service in the \nmost economically efficient, reasonably available \nmanner. \n\n73a \n \n(1) The carrier must provide, to the state commis-\nsion, for intrastate rates, or to the Commission, for in-\nterstate rates, a justification of the proposed rural \nrate, including an itemization of the costs of providing \nthe requested service. \n \n(2) The carrier must provide such information pe-\nriodically thereafter as required, by the state commis-\nsion for intrastate rates or the Commission for inter-\nstate rates. In doing so, the carrier much take into ac-\ncount anticipated and actual demand for telecommu-\nnications services by all customers who will use the \nfacilities over which services are being provided to el-\nigible health care providers. \n \n \n\n74a \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.606 provides: \nCalculating support. \n(a) The amount of universal service support provided \nfor an eligible service to be funded from the Telecom-\nmunications program shall be the difference, if any, \nbetween the urban rate and the rural rate charged for \nthe services, as defined in this section. In addition, all \nreasonable charges that are incurred by taking such \nservices, such as state and federal taxes, shall be eli-\ngible for universal service support. Charges for termi-\nnation liability, penalty surcharges, and other charges \nnot included in the cost of taking such service shall \nnot be covered by the universal service support mech-\nanisms. \n(b) The universal service support mechanisms shall \nprovide support for intrastate telecommunications \nservices, as set forth in \u00a7 54.101(a), provided to rural \nhealth care providers as well as interstate telecommu-\nnications services. \n(c) Mobile rural health care providers \u2014 \n \n(1) Calculation of support. The support amount \nallowed under the Telecommunications Program for \nsatellite services provided to mobile rural health care \nproviders is calculated by comparing the rate for the \nsatellite service to the rate for an urban wireline ser-\nvice with a similar bandwidth. Support for satellite \nservices shall not be capped at an amount of a func-\ntionally similar wireline alternative. Where the mo-\nbile rural health care provider provides service in \nmore than one state, the calculation shall be based on \nthe urban areas in each state, proportional to the \nnumber of locations served in each state. \n\n75a \n \n(2) Documentation of support. \n \n(i) Mobile rural health care providers shall pro-\nvide to the Administrator documentation of the \nprice of bandwidth equivalent wireline services in \nthe urban area in the state or states where the ser-\nvice is provided. Mobile rural health care providers \nshall provide to the Administrator the number of \nsites the mobile health care provider will serve \nduring the funding year. \n \n(ii) Where a mobile rural health care provider \nserves less than eight different sites per year, the \nmobile rural health care provider shall provide to \nthe Administrator documentation of the price of \nbandwidth equivalent wireline services. In such \ncase, the Administrator shall determine on a case-\nby-case basis whether the telecommunications ser-\nvice selected by the mobile rural health care pro-\nvider is the most cost-effective option. Where a mo-\nbile rural health care provider seeks a more expen-\nsive satellite-based service when a less expensive \nwireline alternative is most cost-effective, the mo-\nbile rural health care provider shall be responsible \nfor the additional cost. \n \n \n\n76a \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.622 provides: \nCompetitive bidding requirements and exemp-\ntions. \n(a) Competitive bidding requirement. All appli-\ncants are required to engage in a competitive bidding \nprocess for supported services, facilities, or equip-\nment, as applicable, consistent with the requirements \nset forth in this section and any additional applicable \nstate, Tribal, local, or other procurement require-\nments, unless they qualify for an exemption listed in \nparagraph (i) in this section. In addition, applicants \nmay engage in competitive bidding even if they qual-\nify for an exemption. Applicants who utilize a compet-\nitive bidding exemption may proceed directly to filing \na funding request as described in \u00a7 54.623. \n(b) Fair and open process. \n \n(1) Applicants participating in the Telecommuni-\ncations Program or Healthcare Connect Fund Pro-\ngram must conduct a fair and open competitive bid-\nding process. The following actions are necessary to \nsatisfy the \u201cfair and open\u201d competitive standard in the \nTelecommunications Program and the Healthcare \nConnect Fund Program: \n \n(i) All potential bidders and service providers \nmust have access to the same information and \nmust be treated in the same manner throughout \nthe procurement process. \n \n(ii) Service providers who intend to bid on sup-\nported services many not simultaneously help the \napplicant complete its request for proposal (RFP) \nor Request for Services form. \n \n(iii) Service providers who have submitted a bid \nto provide supported services, equipment, or \n\n77a \nfacilities to a health care provider may not simul-\ntaneously help the health care provider evaluate \nsubmitted bids or choose a winning bid. \n \n(iv) Applicants must respond to all service pro-\nviders that have submitted questions or proposals \nduring the competitive bidding process. \n \n(v) All applicants and service providers must \ncomply with any applicable state, Tribal, or local \nprocurement laws, in addition to the Commission\u2019s \ncompetitive bidding requirements. The competi-\ntive bidding requirements in this section are not \nintended to preempt such state, Tribal, or local re-\nquirements. \n(c) Selecting a cost-effective service. In selecting a \nprovider of eligible services, the applicant shall care-\nfully consider all bids submitted and must select the \nmost cost-effective means of meeting its specific \nhealth care needs. \u201cCost-effective\u201d is defined as the \nmethod that costs the least after consideration of the \nfeatures, quality of transmission, reliability, and \nother factors that the health care provider deems rel-\nevant to choosing a method of providing the required \nhealth care services. In the Healthcare Connect Fund \nProgram, when choosing the most \u201ccost-effective\u201d bid, \nprice must be a primary factor, but need not be the \nonly primary factor. A non-price factor may receive an \nequal weight to price, but may not receive a greater \nweight than price. \n(d) Bid evaluation criteria. Applicants must de-\nvelop weighted evaluation criteria (e.g., a scoring ma-\ntrix) that demonstrates how the applicant will choose \nthe most cost-effective bid before submitting its re-\nquest for services. The applicant must specify on its \nbid evaluation worksheet and/or scoring matrix the \n\n78a \nrequested services for which it seeks bids, the infor-\nmation provided to bidders to allow bidders to reason-\nably determine the needs of the applicant, its mini-\nmum requirements for the developed weighted evalu-\nation criteria, and each service provider\u2019s proposed \nservice levels for the criteria. The applicant must also \nspecify the disqualification factors, if any, that it will \nuse to remove bids or bidders from further considera-\ntion. After reviewing the bid submissions and identi-\nfying the bids that satisfy the applicant\u2019s specific \nneeds, the applicant must then select the service pro-\nvider that offers the most cost-effective service. \n(e) Request for Services. Applicants must submit the \nfollowing documents to the Administrator in order to \ninitiate competitive bidding: \n \n(1) Request for Services, including certifica-\ntions. The applicant must submit a Request for Ser-\nvices and make the following certifications as part of \nits Request for Services: \n \n(i) The entity seeking supported services is a \npublic or nonprofit health care provider that falls \nwithin one of the categories set forth in the defini-\ntion of health care provider listed in \u00a7 54.600, or \nexpects to be such a public or nonprofit health care \nprovider before the end of the funding year for \nwhich the supported services are requested pro-\nvided that the entity has received a conditional ap-\nproval of eligibility pursuant to \u00a7 54.601(c); \n \n(ii) The health care provider seeking supported \nservices is physically located in a rural area as de-\nfined in \u00a7 54.600 or is a member of a Healthcare \nConnect Fund Program consortium which satisfies \nthe rural health care provider composition require-\nments set forth in \u00a7 54.607(b). If an entity seeks \n\n79a \nsupported services under a conditional approval of \neligibility set forth in \u00a7 54.601(c), the entity ex-\npects to be located in a rural area defined in \n\u00a7 54.600 before the end of the funding year for \nwhich the supported services are requested, or \nplans to be a member of a Healthcare Connect \nFund Program consortium which satisfies the ru-\nral health care provider composition requirements \nset forth in \u00a7 54.607(b) before the end of the fund-\ning year for which the supported services are re-\nquested; \n(iii) The person signing the application is au-\nthorized to submit the application on behalf of the \nhealth care provider or consortium applicant; \n \n(iv) The person signing the application has ex-\namined the Request for Services and all attach-\nments, and to the best of his or her knowledge, in-\nformation, and belief, all statements contained in \nthe request are true; \n \n(v) The applicant has complied with any appli-\ncable state, Tribal, or local procurement rules; \n \n(vi) All requested Rural Health Care Program \nsupport will be used solely for purposes reasonably \nrelated to the provision of health care service or in-\nstruction that the health care provider is legally \nauthorized to provide under the law of the state in \nwhich the services are provided; \n \n(vii) The supported services will not be sold, re-\nsold, or transferred in consideration for money or \nany other thing of value; \n \n(viii) The applicant satisfies all of the require-\nments under section 254 of the Act and applicable \nCommission rules; and \n\n80a \n \n(ix) The applicant has reviewed all applicable \nrequirements for the Telecommunications Pro-\ngram or the Healthcare Connect Fund Program, as \napplicable, and will comply with those require-\nments. \n \n(2) Aggregated purchase details. If the service \nor services are being purchased as part of an aggre-\ngated purchase with other entities or individuals, the \nfull details of any such arrangement, including the \nidentities of all co-purchasers and the portion of the \nservice or services being purchased by the health care \nprovider, must be submitted. \n \n(3) Bid evaluation criteria. Requirements for \nbid evaluation criteria are described in paragraph (d) \nin this section and must be included with the appli-\ncant\u2019s Request for Services. \n \n(4) Declaration of Assistance. All applicants \nmust submit a \u201cDeclaration of Assistance\u201d with their \nRequest for Services. In the Declaration of Assistance, \nthe applicant must identify each and every consult-\nant, service provider, and other outside expert, \nwhether paid or unpaid, who aided in the preparation \nof its applications. The applicant must also describe \nthe nature of the relationship it has with each consult-\nant, service provider, or other outside expert provid-\ning such assistance. \n \n(5) Request for proposal (if applicable). \n \n(i) Any applicant may use an RFP.

Contributions to the mechanisms begin-\nning April 1, 2003 shall be based on contributors\u2019 pro-\njected collected end-user telecommunications reve-\nnues, and on a contribution factor determined quar-\nterly by the Commission. \n \n(1) For funding the federal universal service sup-\nport mechanisms prior to April 1, 2003, the subject \nrevenues will be contributors\u2019 interstate and interna-\ntional revenues derived from domestic end users for \ntelecommunications or telecommunications services, \nnet of prior period actual contributions. Beginning \nApril 1, 2003, the subject revenues will be contribu-\ntors\u2019 projected collected interstate and international \nrevenues derived from domestic end users for telecom-\nmunications or telecommunications services, net of \nprojected contributions. \n \n(2) Prior to April 1, 2003, the quarterly universal \nservice contribution factor shall be determined by the \nCommission based on the ratio of total projected quar-\nterly expenses of the universal service support mech-\nanisms to the total end-user interstate and interna-\ntional telecommunications revenues, net of prior pe-\nriod actual contributions. Beginning April 1, 2003, the \nquarterly universal service contribution factor shall \nbe determined by the Commission based on the ratio \nof total projected quarterly expenses of the universal \nservice support mechanisms to the total projected \n\n95a \ncollected end-user interstate and international tele-\ncommunications revenues, net of projected contribu-\ntions. The Commission shall approve the Administra-\ntor\u2019s quarterly projected costs of the universal service \nsupport mechanisms, taking into account demand for \nsupport and administrative expenses. The total sub-\nject revenues shall be compiled by the Administrator \nbased on information contained in the Telecommuni-\ncations \nReporting \nWorksheets \ndescribed \nin \n\u00a7 54.711(a). \n \n(3) Total projected expenses for the federal univer-\nsal service support mechanisms for each quarter must \nbe approved by the Commission before they are used \nto calculate the quarterly contribution factor and in-\ndividual contributions. For each quarter, the Admin-\nistrator must submit its projections of demand for the \nfederal universal service support mechanisms for \nhigh-cost areas, low-income consumers, schools and li-\nbraries, and rural health care providers, respectively, \nand the basis for those projections, to the Commission \nand the Office of the Managing Director at least sixty \n(60) calendar days prior to the start of that quarter. \nFor each quarter, the Administrator must submit its \nprojections of administrative expenses for the high-\ncost mechanism, the low-income mechanism, the \nschools and libraries mechanism and the rural health \ncare mechanism and the basis for those projections to \nthe Commission and the Office of the Managing Direc-\ntor at least sixty (60) calendar days prior to the start \nof that quarter. Based on data submitted to the Ad-\nministrator on the Telecommunications Reporting \nWorksheets, the Administrator must submit the total \ncontribution base to the Office of the Managing Direc-\ntor at least thirty (30) days before the start of each \nquarter. The projections of demand and administra-\ntive expenses and the contribution factor shall be \n\n96a \nannounced by the Commission in a public notice and \nshall be made available on the Commission\u2019s website. \nThe Commission reserves the right to set projections \nof demand and administrative expenses at amounts \nthat the Commission determines will serve the public \ninterest at any time within the fourteen-day period \nfollowing release of the Commission\u2019s public notice. If \nthe Commission take no action within fourteen (14) \ndays of the date of release of the public notice an-\nnouncing the projections of demand and administra-\ntive expenses, the projections of demand and admin-\nistrative expenses, and the contribution factor shall be \ndeemed approved by the Commission. Except as pro-\nvided in \u00a7 54.706(c), the Administrator shall apply the \nquarterly contribution factor, once approved by the \nCommission, to contributor\u2019s interstate and interna-\ntional end-user telecommunications revenues to cal-\nculate the amount of individual contributions. \n(b) If the contributions received by the Administrator \nin a quarter exceed the amount of universal service \nsupport program contributions and administrative \ncosts for that quarter, the excess payments will be car-\nried forward to the following quarter. The contribu-\ntion factors for the following quarter will take into \nconsideration the projected costs of the support mech-\nanisms for that quarter and the excess contributions \ncarried over from the previous quarter. The Commis-\nsion may instruct the Administrator to treat excess \ncontributions in a manner other than as prescribed in \nthis paragraph (b). Such instructions may be made in \nthe form of a Commission Order or a public notice re-\nleased by the Wireline Competition Bureau. Any such \npublic notice will become effective fourteen days after \nrelease of the public notice, absent further Commis-\nsion action. \n\n97a \n(c) If the contributions received by the Administrator \nin a quarter are inadequate to meet the amount of uni-\nversal service support program payments and admin-\nistrative costs for that quarter, the Administrator \nshall request authority from the Commission to bor-\nrow funds commercially, with such debt secured by fu-\nture contributions. Subsequent contribution factors \nwill take into consideration the projected costs of the \nsupport mechanisms and the additional costs associ-\nated with borrowing funds. \n(d) If a contributor fails to file a Telecommunications \nReporting Worksheet by the date on which it is due, \nthe Administrator shall bill that contributor based on \nwhatever relevant data the Administrator has availa-\nble, including, but not limited to, the number of lines \npresubscribed to the contributor and data from previ-\nous years, taking into consideration any estimated \nchanges in such data. \n \n \n\n98a \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.711 provides: \nContributor reporting requirements. \n(a) Contributions shall be calculated and filed in ac-\ncordance with the Telecommunications Reporting \nWorksheet which shall be published in the FEDERAL \nREGISTER. The Telecommunications Reporting Work-\nsheet sets forth information that the contributor must \nsubmit to the Administrator on a quarterly and an-\nnual basis. The Commission shall announce by Public \nNotice published in the FEDERAL REGISTER and on its \nwebsite the manner of payment and dates by which \npayments must be made. An executive officer of the \ncontributor must certify to the truth and accuracy of \nhistorical data included in the Telecommunications \nReporting Worksheet, and that any projections in the \nTelecommunications Reporting Worksheet represent \na good-faith estimate based on the contributor\u2019s poli-\ncies and procedures. The Commission or the Adminis-\ntrator may verify any information contained in the \nTelecommunications Reporting Worksheet. Contribu-\ntors shall maintain records and documentation to jus-\ntify information reported in the Telecommunications \nReporting Worksheet, including the methodology \nused to determine projections, for three years and \nshall provide such records and documentation to the \nCommission or the Administrator upon request. Inac-\ncurate or untruthful information contained in the Tel-\necommunications Reporting Worksheet may lead to \nprosecution under the criminal provisions of Title 18 \nof the United States Code. The Administrator shall \nadvise the Commission of any enforcement issues that \narise and provide any suggested response. \n(b) The Commission shall have access to all data re-\nported to the Administrator. Contributors may make \n\n99a \nrequests for Commission nondisclosure of company-\nspecific revenue information under \u00a7 0.459 of this \nchapter by so indicating on the Telecommunications \nReporting Worksheet at the time that the subject data \nare submitted. The Commission shall make all deci-\nsions regarding nondisclosure of company-specific in-\nformation. The Administrator shall keep confidential \nall data obtained from contributors, shall not use such \ndata except for purposes of administering the univer-\nsal service support programs, and shall not disclose \nsuch data in company-specific form unless directed to \ndo so by the Commission.

The \nAdministrator shall keep confidential all data ob-\ntained from other administrators and shall not use \nsuch data except for purposes of administering the \nuniversal service support mechanisms. \n(c) The Bureau may waive, reduce, modify, or elimi-\nnate contributor reporting requirements that prove \nunnecessary and require additional reporting require-\nments that the Bureau deems necessary to the sound \nand efficient administration of the universal service \nsupport mechanisms. \n \n \n\n100a \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.717 provides: \nAudits of the Administrator. \nThe Administrator shall obtain and pay for an annual \naudit conducted by an independent auditor to exam-\nine its operations and books of account to determine, \namong other things, whether the Administrator is \nproperly administering the universal service support \nmechanisms to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse: \n(a) Before selecting an independent auditor, the Ad-\nministrator shall submit preliminary audit require-\nments, including the proposed scope of the audit and \nthe extent of compliance and substantive testing, to \nthe Office of Managing Director. \n(b) The Office of Managing Director shall review the \npreliminary audit requirements to determine whether \nthey are adequate to meet the audit objectives. The \nOffice of Managing Director shall prescribe modifica-\ntions that shall be incorporated into the final audit re-\nquirements. \n(c) After the audit requirements have been approved \nby the Office of Managing Director, the Administrator \nshall engage within thirty (30) calendar days an inde-\npendent auditor to conduct the annual audit required \nby this paragraph. In making its selection, the Admin-\nistrator shall not engage any independent auditor who \nhas been involved in designing any of the accounting \nor reporting systems under review in the audit. \n(d) The independent auditor selected by the Adminis-\ntrator to conduct the annual audit shall be instructed \nby the Administrator to develop a detailed audit pro-\ngram based on the final audit requirements and shall \nbe instructed by the Administrator to submit the au-\ndit program to the Office of Managing Director. The \n\n101a \nOffice of Managing Director shall review the audit \nprogram and make modifications, as needed, that \nshall be incorporated into the final audit program. \nDuring the course of the audit, the Office of Managing \nDirector may direct the Administrator to direct the in-\ndependent auditor to take any actions necessary to en-\nsure compliance with the audit requirements. \n(e) During the course of the audit, the Administrator \nshall instruct the independent auditor to: \n \n(1) Inform the Office of Managing Director of any \nrevisions to the final audit program or to the scope of \nthe audit; \n \n(2) Notify the Office of Managing Director of any \nmeetings with the Administrator in which audit find-\nings are discussed; and \n \n(3) Submit to the Chief of the Wireline Competition \nBureau any accounting or rule interpretations neces-\nsary to complete the audit. \n(f) Within 105 calendar days after the end of the audit \nperiod, but prior to discussing the audit findings with \nthe Administrator, the independent auditor shall be \ninstructed by the Administrator to submit a draft of \nthe audit report to the Office of Managing Director \nAudit Staff. \n(g) The Office of Managing Director shall review the \naudit findings and audit workpapers and offer its rec-\nommendations concerning the conduct of the audit or \nthe audit findings to the independent auditor. Excep-\ntions of the Office of Managing Director to the findings \nand conclusions of the independent auditor that re-\nmain unresolved shall be included in the final audit \nreport. \n(h) Within fifteen (15) calendar days after receiving \n\n102a \nthe Office of Managing Director\u2019s recommendations \nand making any revisions to the audit report, the Ad-\nministrator shall instruct the independent auditor to \nsubmit the audit report to the Administrator for its \nresponse to the audit findings. At this time the auditor \nalso must send copies of its audit findings to the Office \nof Managing Director.

Rural \nDigital Opportunity Fund support may be made avail-\nable for census blocks or other areas identified as eli-\ngible by public notice. \n(b) Term of support. Rural Digital Opportunity Fund \nsupport shall be provided for ten years. \n(c) Deployment obligation.  \n \n(1) All recipients of Rural Digital Opportunity \nFund support must complete deployment to 40 per-\ncent of the required number of locations as deter-\nmined by the Connect America Cost Model by the end \nof the third year, to 60 percent by the end of the fourth \nyear, and to 80 percent by the end of the fifth year. \nThe Wireline Competition Bureau will publish up-\ndated location counts no later than the end of the sixth \nyear. A support recipient\u2019s final service milestones \nwill depend on whether the Wireline Competition Bu-\nreau determines there are more or fewer locations \nthan determined by the Connect America Cost Model \nin the relevant areas as follows: \n \n(i) More Locations. After the Wireline Compe-\ntition Bureau adopts updated location counts, in \nareas where there are more locations than the \nnumber of locations determined by the Connect \nAmerica Cost Model, recipients of Rural Digital \nOpportunity Fund support must complete deploy-\nment to 100 percent of the number of locations de-\ntermined by the Connect America Cost Model by \nthe end of the sixth year. Recipients of Rural \n\n107a \nDigital Opportunity Fund support must then com-\nplete deployment to 100 percent of the additional \nnumber of locations determined by the Wireline \nCompetition Bureau\u2019s updated location count by \nend of the eighth year. If the new location count \nexceeds 35% of the number of locations determined \nby the Connect America Cost Model within their \narea in each state, recipients of Rural Digital Op-\nportunity Fund support will have the opportunity \nto seek additional support or relief. \n \n(ii) Fewer Locations. In areas where there are \nfewer locations than the number of locations deter-\nmined by the Connect America Cost Model, a Rural \nDigital Opportunity Fund support recipient must \nnotify the Wireline Competition Bureau no later \nthan March 1 following the fifth year of deploy-\nment. Upon confirmation by the Wireline Compe-\ntition Bureau, Rural Digital Opportunity Fund \nsupport recipients must complete deployment to \nthe number of locations required by the new loca-\ntion count by the end of the sixth year. Support re-\ncipients for which the new location count is less \nthan 65 percent of the Connect America Cost \nModel locations within their area in each state \nshall have the support amount reduced on a pro \nrata basis by the number of reduced locations. \n \n(iii) Newly Built Locations. In addition to of-\nfering the required service to the updated number \nof locations identified by the Wireline Competition \nBureau, Rural Digital Opportunity Fund support \nrecipients must offer service to locations built since \nthe revised count, upon reasonable request. Sup-\nport recipients are not required to deploy to any lo-\ncation built after milestone year eight. \n\n108a \n(d) Disbursement of Rural Digital Opportunity \nFund funding.

For \npurposes of determining reasonable comparable usage \ncapacity, recipients are presumed to meet this re-\nquirement if they meet or exceed the usage level an-\nnounced by public notice issued by the Wireline Com-\npetition Bureau. For purposes of determining reason-\nable comparability of rates, recipients are presumed \nto meet this requirement if they offer rates at or below \nthe applicable benchmark to be announced annually \nby public notice issued by the Wireline Competition \nBureau, or no more than the non-promotional prices \ncharged for a comparable fixed wireline service in ur-\nban areas in the state or U.S. Territory where the eli-\ngible telecommunications carrier receives support. \n(b) Recipients of Rural Digital Opportunity Fund sup-\nport are required to offer broadband service meeting \nthe performance standards for the relevant perfor-\nmance tier. \n \n(1) Rural Digital Opportunity Fund support recip-\nients meeting the minimum performance tier stand-\nards are required to offer broadband service at actual \nspeeds of at least 25 Mbps downstream and 3 Mbps \nupstream and offer a minimum usage allowance of \n250 GB per month, or that reflects the average usage \nof a majority of fixed broadband customers as \n\n122a \nannounced annually by the Wireline Competition Bu-\nreau over the 10-year term. \n \n(2) Rural Digital Opportunity Fund support recip-\nients meeting the above-baseline performance tier \nstandards are required to offer broadband service at \nactual speeds of at least 100 Mbps downstream and \n20 Mbps upstream and offer at least 2 terabytes of \nmonthly usage. \n \n(3) Rural Digital Opportunity Fund support recip-\nients meeting the Gigabit performance tier standards \nare required to offer broadband service at actual \nspeeds of at least 1 Gigabit per second downstream \nand 500 Mbps upstream and offer at least 2 terabytes \nof monthly usage. \n \n(4) For each of the tiers in paragraphs (b)(1) \nthrough (3) of this section, bidders are required to \nmeet one of two latency performance levels: \n \n(i) Low-latency bidders will be required to meet \n95 percent or more of all peak period measure-\nments of network round trip latency at or below \n100 milliseconds; and \n \n(ii) High-latency bidders will be required to \nmeet 95 percent or more of all peak period meas-\nurements of network round trip latency at or below \n750 ms and, with respect to voice performance, \ndemonstrate a score of four or higher using the \nMean Opinion Score (MOS). \n(c) Recipients of Rural Digital Opportunity Fund sup-\nport are required to bid on category one telecommuni-\ncations and internet access services in response to a \nposted FCC Form 470 seeking broadband service that \nmeets the connectivity targets for the schools and li-\nbraries universal service support program for eligible \nschools and libraries (as described in \u00a7 54.501) located \n\n123a \nwithin any area in a census block where the carrier is \nreceiving Rural Digital Opportunity Fund support. \nSuch bids must be at rates reasonably comparable to \nrates charged to eligible schools and libraries in urban \nareas for comparable offerings. \n \n \n\n124a \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.806 provides: \nRural Digital Opportunity Fund reporting obli-\ngations, compliance, and recordkeeping. \n(a) Recipients of Rural Digital Opportunity Fund sup-\nport shall be subject to the reporting obligations set \nforth in \u00a7\u00a7 54.313, 54.314, and 54.316. \n(b) Recipients of Rural Digital Opportunity Fund sup-\nport shall be subject to the compliance measures, \nrecordkeeping requirements and audit requirements \nset forth in \u00a7 54.320(a)-(c). \n(c) Recipients of Rural Digital Opportunity Fund sup-\nport shall be subject to the non-compliance measures \nset forth in \u00a7 54.320(d) subject to the following modi-\nfications related to the recovery of support. \n \n(1) If the support recipient does not report it has \ncome into full compliance after the grace period for its \nsixth year or eighth year service milestone as applica-\nble or if USAC determines in the course of a compli-\nance review that the eligible telecommunications car-\nrier does not have sufficient evidence to demonstrate \nthat it is offering service to all of the locations re-\nquired by the sixth or eighth year service milestone as \nset forth in \u00a7 54.320(d)(3): \n \n(i) Sixth year service milestone. Support will be \nrecovered as follows after the sixth year service \nmilestone grace period or if USAC later determines \nin the course of a compliance review that a support \nrecipient does not have sufficient evidence to \ndemonstrate that it was offering service to all of \nthe locations required by the sixth year service \nmilestone: \n \n(A) If an ETC has deployed to 95 percent or \nmore of the Connect America Cost Model \n\n125a \nlocation count or the adjusted Connect America \nCost Model location count if there are fewer lo-\ncations, but less than 100 percent, USAC will \nrecover an amount of support that is equal to \n1.25 times the average amount of support per \nlocation received in the state for that ETC over \nthe support term for the relevant number of lo-\ncations; \n \n(B) If an ETC has deployed to 90 percent or \nmore of the Connect America Cost Model loca-\ntion count or the adjusted Connect America \nCost Model location count if there are fewer lo-\ncations, but less than 95 percent, USAC will re-\ncover an amount of support that is equal to \n1.5 times the average amount of support per lo-\ncation received in the state for that ETC over \nthe support term for the relevant number of lo-\ncations, plus 5 percent of the support recipient\u2019s \ntotal Rural Digital Opportunity Fund support \nauthorized over the 10-year support term for \nthat state; \n \n(C) If an ETC has deployed to fewer than \n90 percent of the Connect America Cost Model \nlocation count or the adjusted Connect America \nCost Model location count if there are fewer lo-\ncations, USAC will recover an amount of sup-\nport that is equal to 1.75 times the average \namount of support per location received in the \nstate for that ETC over the support term for the \nrelevant number of locations, plus 10 percent of \nthe support recipient\u2019s total Rural Digital Op-\nportunity Fund support authorized over the \n10-year support term for that state. \n \n(ii) Eighth year service milestone. If a Rural \nDigital Opportunity Fund support recipient is \n\n126a \nrequired to serve more new locations than deter-\nmined by the Connect America Cost Model, sup-\nport will be recovered as follows after the eighth \nyear service milestone grace period or if USAC \nlater determines in the course of a compliance re-\nview that a support recipient does not have suffi-\ncient evidence to demonstrate that it was offering \nservice to all of the locations required by the eighth \nyear service milestone: \n \n(A) If an ETC has deployed to 95 percent or \nmore of its new location count, but less than 100 \npercent, USAC will recover an amount of sup-\nport that is equal to the average amount of sup-\nport per location received in the state for that \nETC over the support term for the relevant \nnumber of locations; \n \n(B) If an ETC has deployed to 90 percent or \nmore of its new location count, but less than \n95 percent, USAC will recover an amount of \nsupport that is equal to 1.25 times the average \namount of support per location received in the \nstate for that ETC over the support term for the \nrelevant number of locations; \n \n(C) If an ETC has deployed to 85 percent or \nmore of its new location count, but less than \n90 percent, USAC will recover an amount of \nsupport that is equal to 1.5 times the average \namount of support per location received in the \nstate for that ETC over the support term for the \nrelevant number of locations, plus 5 percent of \nthe support recipient\u2019s total Rural Digital Op-\nportunity Fund support authorized over the \n10-year support term for that state; \n\n127a \n \n(D) If an ETC has deployed to less than \n85 percent of its new location count, USAC will \nrecover an amount of support that is equal to \n1.75 times the average amount of support per \nlocation received in the state for that ETC over \nthe support term for the relevant number of lo-\ncations, plus 10 percent of the support recipi-\nent\u2019s total Rural Digital Opportunity Fund sup-\nport authorized over the 10-year support term \nfor that state. \n \n(2) Any support recipient that believes it cannot \nmeet the third-year service milestone must notify the \nWireline Competition Bureau within 10 business days \nof the third-year service milestone deadline and pro-\nvide information explaining this expected deficiency. \nIf a support recipient has not made such a notification \nby March 1 following the third-year service milestone, \nand has deployed to fewer than 20 percent of the re-\nquired number of locations by the end of the third \nyear, the recipient will immediately be in default and \nsubject to support recovery. The Tier 4 status six-\nmonth grace period as set forth in \u00a7 54.320(d)(iv) will \nnot be applicable.",

This is one of the most critical documents for understanding the case and predicting the outcome. The agent has already gathered preliminary documents (lower court opinion, cert petition, opposition brief). The next logical and essential step is to analyze the detailed arguments the parties will present to the Court.\n\nTask EIG is very high (0.9) because this brief will contain the petitioner's complete legal reasoning, their interpretation of precedent, and the specific arguments they will use to persuade the Justices. Understanding how the government frames its defense of the delegation of power is fundamental to predicting how justices, particularly those skeptical of the administrative state, will react.\n\nDesign EIG is moderate (0.4). The action represents a standard, methodical step in legal case analysis. It reinforces the effectiveness of a structured research strategy (lower court opinion -> cert-stage briefs -> merits briefs). While not a novel or surprising strategy, successfully executing this step confirms that this systematic approach is a valid and effective design for this prediction task. It's a valuable confirmation of a core procedural hypothesis.",

Congress defined universal service and \nadopted specific, detailed principles to guide and \ncabin the FCC\u2019s exercise of delegated authority. \nSee 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(b), (c), (d), (h).  \nFollowing Congress\u2019s directive in Section 254, the \nFCC has administered the Universal Service Fund \n(\u201cUSF\u201d or the \u201cFund\u201d) for decades, with ministerial \nsupport from the Universal Service Administrative \nCompany (\u201cUSAC\u201d or the \u201cAdministrator\u201d). The \nFCC\u2019s rules limit USAC\u2019s role to administrative \nmatters, \nprohibit \nUSAC \nfrom \nmaking \npolicy \ndecisions, and provide for de novo FCC review of any \nUSAC decision upon request. \nThe questions presented are: \n1. Whether Congress violated the nondelegation \ndoctrine \nby \nauthorizing \nthe \nCommission \nto \ndetermine, within the limits set forth in Section 254, \nthe amount that providers must contribute to the \nFund. \n2. \nWhether \nthe \nCommission \nviolated \nthe \nnondelegation doctrine by using the Administrator\u2019s \nfinancial projections in computing universal service \ncontribution rates. \n3. \nWhether \nthe \ncombination \nof \nCongress\u2019s \nconferral of authority on the Commission and the \nCommission\u2019s \ndelegation \nof \nadministrative \n\nii \n \nresponsibilities to the Administrator violates the \nnondelegation doctrine. \n4. Whether this case is moot in light of the \nchallengers\u2019 failure to seek preliminary relief before \nthe Fifth Circuit. \n\niii \n \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nAND RULE 29.6 STATEMENT \nPetitioners in Case No. 24-354 are the Federal \nCommunications Commission and the United States \nof America. \nPetitioners in Case No. 24-422 are the Schools, \nHealth & Libraries Broadband Coalition (\u201cSHLB \nCoalition\u201d), Benton Institute for Broadband & \nSociety, National Digital Inclusion Alliance, and \nCenter for Media Justice dba MediaJustice, Competi-\ntive \nCarriers \nAssociation, \nNational \nTele-\ncommunications Cooperative Association dba NTCA, \nand USTelecom \u2013 The Broadband Association. \nRespondents in both cases are Consumers\u2019 Re-\nsearch; Cause Based Commerce, Inc.; Kersten Con-\nway; Suzanne Bettac; Robert Kull; Kwang Ja Kirby; \nTom Kirby; Joseph Bayly; Jeremy Roth; Deanna \nRoth; Lynn Gibbs; Paul Gibbs; and Rhonda Thomas. \nThe disclosure statement included in the Petition \nfor Writ of Certiorari in Case No. 24-422 remains ac-\ncurate as to SHLB Coalition, Benton Institute for \nBroadband & Society, National Digital Inclusion \nAlliance, and Center for Media Justice dba Media-\nJustice. \n  \n \n\niv \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nQUESTIONS PRESENTED ....................................... i \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING AND RULE 29.6 \nSTATEMENT ............................................................ iii \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES ....................................... vi \nOPINIONS BELOW .................................................... 1 \nJURISDICTIONAL STATEMENT ............................. 1 \nCONSTITUTIONAL, STATUTORY, AND \nREGULATORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED .............. 1 \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE .................................... 2 \nA.

This Court \nhas jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1).  \nCONSTITUTIONAL, STATUTORY, AND \nREGULATORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nArticle I, Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution \nprovides: \u201cAll legislative Powers herein granted shall \nbe vested in a Congress of the United States, which \nshall \nconsist \nof \na \nSenate \nand \nHouse \nof \nRepresentatives.\u201d \nPertinent statutory and regulatory provisions are \nreproduced at App. 1a-127a to this brief. \n \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. The FCC\u2019s History of Promoting Universal \nService  \nThe FCC\u2019s history of promoting universal service \nlong predates the Telecommunications Act of 1996 \n(\u201c1996 Act\u201d). Congress created the FCC in the \nCommunications Act of 1934, Pub. L. No. 73-416, 48 \nStat. 1064 (1934) (\u201cthe Act\u201d or \u201cCommunications \nAct\u201d), with a charge to promote universal service\u2014\ni.e., \u201cto make available \u2026 to all the people of the \nUnited States \u2026 a rapid, efficient, Nation-wide, and \nworld-wide \n\u2026 \ncommunication \nservice \n\u2026 \nat \nreasonable charges.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 151. \nIn 1934, \u201cAT&T \u2026 held a virtual monopoly over \nthe Nation\u2019s telephone service.\u201d MCI Telecomms. \nCorp. v. Am. Tel. & Tel. Co., 512 U.S. 218, 220 \n(1994). AT&T\u2019s vertical business model enabled it to \nprovide long-distance telephone service at higher \nrates to help subsidize its subsidiaries\u2019 local service.  \nIn the early 1980s, following antitrust litigation \nresulting from the development of competition in the \nlong-distance market, AT&T was forced to divest its \nlocal telephone subsidiaries. Because AT&T could no \nlonger internally subsidize local service, the FCC \nbegan assessing charges on all interstate long-\ndistance carriers to finance a \u201cUniversal Service \nFund\u201d to support high-cost areas.1 That Fund used \nrevenues from \u201ceasy-to-reach customers, such as city \ndwellers, to implicitly subsidize service to those in \n \n1 See Access Charges; MTS and WATS Market Structure, \n48 Fed. Reg. 10319, \u00b6 123 (Mar. 11, 1983) (\u201c1983 Access \nCharge Order\u201d). \n\n3 \n \nareas that were hard to reach.\u201d AT&T, Inc. v. FCC, \n886 F.3d 1236, 1242 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (citation \nomitted). \nAt that time, the FCC derived the authority to \npromote universal service from several general \nprovisions of the Communications Act. See 1983 \nAccess Charge Order \u00b6\u00b6 36-55, 83; infra p.20 & n.27. \nSee generally Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n Regul. Util. Comm\u2019rs v. \nFCC, 737 F.2d 1095, 1108 n.6 (D.C. Cir. 1984) \n(\u201cNARUC\u201d) (affirming the FCC\u2019s implicit universal \nservice goal and related authority).  \nThe FCC also allowed providers to assess end-\nuser charges.2 Out of concern that these new charges \ncould impact telephone subscribership levels, and \nthus \nundermine \nuniversal \nservice, \nthe \nFCC \nimplemented the Lifeline program to waive the end-\nuser charges for qualifying households.3  \nB. Congress\u2019s Direction to the FCC to Promote \nUniversal Service in the 1996 Act \nIn 1996, Congress adopted fundamental changes \nthat moved away from a monopoly-based system for \nlocal telephone service to a competitive market-\ndriven \napproach. \nBecause \ncompetition \nwas \ninconsistent with the use of implicit subsidies, \nCongress required the FCC to replace its implicit \nsubsidy system with explicit universal service \nmechanisms, as codified in 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254.  \n \n2 1983 Access Charge Order \u00b6 3. \n3 See \nMTS \nand \nWATS \nMarket \nStructure; \nand \nEstablishment of a Joint Board; Amendment, 50 Fed. \nReg. 939 (Jan. 8, 1985); MTS and WATS Market \nStructure, 51 Fed. Reg. 1371 (Jan. 13, 1986). \n\n4 \n \nSection 254 directs the FCC\u2019s implementation of \nuniversal service in numerous ways.  \nUniversal Service Definition. Congress defined \nuniversal \nservice \nas \n\u201can \nevolving \nlevel \nof \ntelecommunications services that the Commission \nshall establish periodically under this section, taking \ninto account advances in telecommunications and \ninformation technologies and services.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(c)(1); see also S. Rep. No. 104-23, at 27 (1995) \n(explaining the intention to \u201censure that the \ndefinition of universal service evolves over time to \nkeep pace with modern life\u201d). Congress authorized \nthe FCC to define the \u201cservices that are supported by \nFederal universal service support mechanisms,\u201d \nrequiring that the FCC \u201cshall consider\u201d the extent to \nwhich the services are \u201cessential to education, public \nhealth, or public safety,\u201d \u201csubscribed to by a \nsubstantial majority of residential customers,\u201d \u201cbeing \ndeployed in public telecommunications networks,\u201d \nand \u201cconsistent with the public interest, convenience, \nand necessity.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(c)(1)(A)-(D). \nPrinciples. Congress required the FCC to base its \nuniversal service policies on six limiting principles. \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(b). The first three principles \nprovided direction for implementation, building on \nthe \nFCC\u2019s \nprior \nuniversal \nservice \ntenets \nof \naffordability and nationwide availability: \n(1) QUALITY \nAND RATES. Quality services \nshould be available at just, reasonable, and \naffordable rates. \n(2) ACCESS TO ADVANCED SERVICES. Access to \nadvanced telecommunications and information \nservices should be provided in all regions of \nthe Nation. \n\n5 \n \n(3) ACCESS IN RURAL AND HIGH COST AREAS. \nConsumers in all regions of the Nation, \nincluding low-income consumers and those in \nrural, insular, and high cost areas, should \nhave \naccess \nto \ntelecommunications \nand \ninformation services \u2026 that are reasonably \ncomparable to those services provided in \nurban areas and that are available at rates \nthat are reasonably comparable \u2026 .  \nId. \u00a7 254(b)(1)-(3). \nThe fourth and fifth enumerated principles \nestablished guidelines for a funding mechanism: \n(4) EQUITABLE \nAND \nNONDISCRIMINATORY \nCONTRIBUTIONS. All providers of telecomm-\nunications services should make an equitable \nand no\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Congress defined universal service and \nadopted specific, detailed principles to guide and \ncabin the FCC\u2019s exercise of delegated authority. \nSee 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(b), (c), (d), (h).  \nFollowing Congress\u2019s directive in Section 254, the \nFCC has administered the Universal Service Fund \n(\u201cUSF\u201d or the \u201cFund\u201d) for decades, with ministerial \nsupport from the Universal Service Administrative \nCompany (\u201cUSAC\u201d or the \u201cAdministrator\u201d). The \nFCC\u2019s rules limit USAC\u2019s role to administrative \nmatters, \nprohibit \nUSAC \nfrom \nmaking \npolicy \ndecisions, and provide for de novo FCC review of any \nUSAC decision upon request. \nThe questions presented are: \n1. Whether Congress violated the nondelegation \ndoctrine \nby \nauthorizing \nthe \nCommission \nto \ndetermine, within the limits set forth in Section 254, \nthe amount that providers must contribute to the \nFund. \n2. \nWhether \nthe \nCommission \nviolated \nthe \nnondelegation doctrine by using the Administrator\u2019s \nfinancial projections in computing universal service \ncontribution rates. \n3. \nWhether \nthe \ncombination \nof \nCongress\u2019s \nconferral of authority on the Commission and the \nCommission\u2019s \ndelegation \nof \nadministrative \n\nii \n \nresponsibilities to the Administrator violates the \nnondelegation doctrine. \n4. Whether this case is moot in light of the \nchallengers\u2019 failure to seek preliminary relief before \nthe Fifth Circuit. \n\niii \n \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nAND RULE 29.6 STATEMENT \nPetitioners in Case No. 24-354 are the Federal \nCommunications Commission and the United States \nof America. \nPetitioners in Case No. 24-422 are the Schools, \nHealth & Libraries Broadband Coalition (\u201cSHLB \nCoalition\u201d), Benton Institute for Broadband & \nSociety, National Digital Inclusion Alliance, and \nCenter for Media Justice dba MediaJustice, Competi-\ntive \nCarriers \nAssociation, \nNational \nTele-\ncommunications Cooperative Association dba NTCA, \nand USTelecom \u2013 The Broadband Association. \nRespondents in both cases are Consumers\u2019 Re-\nsearch; Cause Based Commerce, Inc.; Kersten Con-\nway; Suzanne Bettac; Robert Kull; Kwang Ja Kirby; \nTom Kirby; Joseph Bayly; Jeremy Roth; Deanna \nRoth; Lynn Gibbs; Paul Gibbs; and Rhonda Thomas. \nThe disclosure statement included in the Petition \nfor Writ of Certiorari in Case No. 24-422 remains ac-\ncurate as to SHLB Coalition, Benton Institute for \nBroadband & Society, National Digital Inclusion \nAlliance, and Center for Media Justice dba Media-\nJustice. \n  \n \n\niv \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nQUESTIONS PRESENTED ....................................... i \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING AND RULE 29.6 \nSTATEMENT ............................................................ iii \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES ....................................... vi \nOPINIONS BELOW .................................................... 1 \nJURISDICTIONAL STATEMENT ............................. 1 \nCONSTITUTIONAL, STATUTORY, AND \nREGULATORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED .............. 1 \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE .................................... 2 \nA.

No. 73-416, 48 \nStat. 1064 (1934) (\u201cthe Act\u201d or \u201cCommunications \nAct\u201d), with a charge to promote universal service\u2014\ni.e., \u201cto make available \u2026 to all the people of the \nUnited States \u2026 a rapid, efficient, Nation-wide, and \nworld-wide \n\u2026 \ncommunication \nservice \n\u2026 \nat \nreasonable charges.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 151. \nIn 1934, \u201cAT&T \u2026 held a virtual monopoly over \nthe Nation\u2019s telephone service.\u201d MCI Telecomms. \nCorp. v. Am. Tel. & Tel. Co., 512 U.S. 218, 220 \n(1994). AT&T\u2019s vertical business model enabled it to \nprovide long-distance telephone service at higher \nrates to help subsidize its subsidiaries\u2019 local service.  \nIn the early 1980s, following antitrust litigation \nresulting from the development of competition in the \nlong-distance market, AT&T was forced to divest its \nlocal telephone subsidiaries. Because AT&T could no \nlonger internally subsidize local service, the FCC \nbegan assessing charges on all interstate long-\ndistance carriers to finance a \u201cUniversal Service \nFund\u201d to support high-cost areas.1 That Fund used \nrevenues from \u201ceasy-to-reach customers, such as city \ndwellers, to implicitly subsidize service to those in \n \n1 See Access Charges; MTS and WATS Market Structure, \n48 Fed. Reg. 10319, \u00b6 123 (Mar. 11, 1983) (\u201c1983 Access \nCharge Order\u201d). \n\n3 \n \nareas that were hard to reach.\u201d AT&T, Inc. v. FCC, \n886 F.3d 1236, 1242 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (citation \nomitted). \nAt that time, the FCC derived the authority to \npromote universal service from several general \nprovisions of the Communications Act. See 1983 \nAccess Charge Order \u00b6\u00b6 36-55, 83; infra p.20 & n.27. \nSee generally Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n Regul. Util. Comm\u2019rs v. \nFCC, 737 F.2d 1095, 1108 n.6 (D.C. Cir. 1984) \n(\u201cNARUC\u201d) (affirming the FCC\u2019s implicit universal \nservice goal and related authority).  \nThe FCC also allowed providers to assess end-\nuser charges.2 Out of concern that these new charges \ncould impact telephone subscribership levels, and \nthus \nundermine \nuniversal \nservice, \nthe \nFCC \nimplemented the Lifeline program to waive the end-\nuser charges for qualifying households.3  \nB. Congress\u2019s Direction to the FCC to Promote \nUniversal Service in the 1996 Act \nIn 1996, Congress adopted fundamental changes \nthat moved away from a monopoly-based system for \nlocal telephone service to a competitive market-\ndriven \napproach. \nBecause \ncompetition \nwas \ninconsistent with the use of implicit subsidies, \nCongress required the FCC to replace its implicit \nsubsidy system with explicit universal service \nmechanisms, as codified in 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254.  \n \n2 1983 Access Charge Order \u00b6 3. \n3 See \nMTS \nand \nWATS \nMarket \nStructure; \nand \nEstablishment of a Joint Board; Amendment, 50 Fed. \nReg. 939 (Jan. 8, 1985); MTS and WATS Market \nStructure, 51 Fed. Reg. 1371 (Jan. 13, 1986). \n\n4 \n \nSection 254 directs the FCC\u2019s implementation of \nuniversal service in numerous ways.  \nUniversal Service Definition. Congress defined \nuniversal \nservice \nas \n\u201can \nevolving \nlevel \nof \ntelecommunications services that the Commission \nshall establish periodically under this section, taking \ninto account advances in telecommunications and \ninformation technologies and services.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(c)(1); see also S. Rep. No. 104-23, at 27 (1995) \n(explaining the intention to \u201censure that the \ndefinition of universal service evolves over time to \nkeep pace with modern life\u201d). Congress authorized \nthe FCC to define the \u201cservices that are supported by \nFederal universal service support mechanisms,\u201d \nrequiring that the FCC \u201cshall consider\u201d the extent to \nwhich the services are \u201cessential to education, public \nhealth, or public safety,\u201d \u201csubscribed to by a \nsubstantial majority of residential customers,\u201d \u201cbeing \ndeployed in public telecommunications networks,\u201d \nand \u201cconsistent with the public interest, convenience, \nand necessity.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(c)(1)(A)-(D). \nPrinciples. Congress required the FCC to base its \nuniversal service policies on six limiting principles. \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(b). The first three principles \nprovided direction for implementation, building on \nthe \nFCC\u2019s \nprior \nuniversal \nservice \ntenets \nof \naffordability and nationwide availability: \n(1) QUALITY \nAND RATES. Quality services \nshould be available at just, reasonable, and \naffordable rates. \n(2) ACCESS TO ADVANCED SERVICES. Access to \nadvanced telecommunications and information \nservices should be provided in all regions of \nthe Nation. \n\n5 \n \n(3) ACCESS IN RURAL AND HIGH COST AREAS. \nConsumers in all regions of the Nation, \nincluding low-income consumers and those in \nrural, insular, and high cost areas, should \nhave \naccess \nto \ntelecommunications \nand \ninformation services \u2026 that are reasonably \ncomparable to those services provided in \nurban areas and that are available at rates \nthat are reasonably comparable \u2026 .  \nId. \u00a7 254(b)(1)-(3). \nThe fourth and fifth enumerated principles \nestablished guidelines for a funding mechanism: \n(4) EQUITABLE \nAND \nNONDISCRIMINATORY \nCONTRIBUTIONS. All providers of telecomm-\nunications services should make an equitable \nand nondiscriminatory contribution to the \npreservation and advancement of universal \nservice. \n(5) SPECIFIC \nAND \nPREDICTABLE \nSUPPORT \nMECHANISMS. \nThere \nshould \nbe \nspecific, \npredictable and sufficient Federal and State \nmechanisms \nto \npreserve \nand \nadvance \nuniversal service.  \nId. \u00a7 254(b)(4)-(5). \nIn the last enumerated principle, Congress \nestablished schools, libraries, and rural health care \nproviders as explicit beneficiaries: \n(6) ACCESS \nTO \nADVANCED \nTELECOMM-\nUNICATIONS SERVICES FOR SCHOOLS, HEALTH \nCARE, \nAND \nLIBRARIES. \nElementary \nand \nsecondary schools and classrooms, health care \nproviders, and libraries should have access to \n\n6 \n \nadvanced \ntelecommunications \nservices \nas \ndescribed in subsection (h). \nId. \u00a7 254(b)(6). \nCongress also authorized the FCC to adopt \nadditional principles, subject to the requirements \nthat they \u201care necessary and appropriate for the \nprotection of the public interest, convenience, and \nnecessity and are consistent with this chapter.\u201d Id. \n\u00a7 254(b)(7).  \nFunding Mechanism. Congress established the \nframework for contributions to finance universal \nservice. It required every \u201ccarrier that provides \ninterstate telecommunications service [to] contribute, \non an equitable and nondiscriminatory basis to the \nspecific, predictable, and sufficient mechanisms \nestablished by the Commission to preserve and \nadvance universal service.\u201d Id. \u00a7 254(d). Congress \nspecified that the support be \u201cexplicit and sufficient \nto achieve the purposes\u201d of Section 254. Id. \u00a7 254(e). \nSpecific \nPrograms. \nFor \nthe \nnew \nsupport \nmechanisms for rural health care providers and \nschools and libraries, Congress required that \ntelecommunications carriers provide services at \ndiscounted rates. For rural health care facilities, the \nrate must be \u201creasonably comparable to rates \ncharged for similar services in urban areas in that \nState.\u201d Id. \u00a7 254(h)(1)(A). For \u201celementary schools, \nsecondary schools, and libraries,\u201d Congress directed \nthe Commission to provide a discount compared to \nthe rates for \u201csimilar services to other parties\u201d that \n\u201cthe Commission \u2026 determine[s] is appropriate and \nnecessary to ensure affordable access to and use of \nsuch services by such entities.\u201d Id. \u00a7 254(h)(1)(B).  \n\n7 \n \nOversight. \nCongress \nestablished \nperiodic \nreporting requirements in the 1996 Act and \nsubsequent \nlegislation \nto \noversee \nthe \nFCC\u2019s \nimplementation of Section 254. For example, the \nFCC must conduct an annual inquiry into \u201cthe \navailability \nof \nadvanced \ntelecommunications \ncapability to all Americans\u201d and, if necessary, \u201ctake \nimmediate action to accelerate deployment of such \ncapability.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1302(b). And in 1997, immediately \nafter the FCC issued rules implementing Section \n254, Congress required the FCC to submit a detailed \nreport on who was required to contribute, and who \nwas permitted to receive, universal service funds.4  \nLikewise in 2009, Congress mandated that the \nFCC assess the state of broadband deployment.5 The \nFCC published the National Broadband Plan the \nfollowing year.6 And in 2021, Congress further \nrequired the FCC to provide recommendations for \n\u201cimproving \nits \neffectiveness \nin \nachieving \nthe \nuniversal service goals for broadband,\u201d with a \nlimitation that the recommendations \u201cmay not in any \nway reduce the congressional mandate to achieve the \n \n4 Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the \nJudiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, \n1998, Pub.

FCC Implementation of Section 254 \n1. In 1997, the FCC adopted regulations to \nimplement Congress\u2019s directives.9  \nHigh Cost. As Congress directed, the FCC \nadopted an explicit support mechanism. Id. \u00b6 246; \nsee 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(e). The FCC implemented the \nstatutory requirement that rates in high-cost areas \nbe \u201creasonably comparable\u201d to urban rates, 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(b)(3), by presuming that a rural rate within \ntwo standard deviations of the national average \nurban rate was \u201creasonably comparable.\u201d10  \nLifeline. The FCC modified the Lifeline program \nto make it consistent with Congress\u2019s direction that \n\u201clow-income consumers\u201d should have access to \ntelecommunications \u201cin all regions of the Nation.\u201d 47 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 254(b)(3).11 The FCC similarly implemented \nCongress\u2019s direction that low-income consumers \nshould have \u201creasonably comparable\u201d services, 47 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 254(b)(3), by providing that the Lifeline \n \n7 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Pub.

The FCC developed the \u201cE-Rate\u201d program \nto satisfy Congress\u2019s explicit direction to include \nschools \nand \nlibraries \nas \nuniversal \nservice \nbeneficiaries.13 To satisfy Congress\u2019s mandate that \nthe discount for schools and libraries be \u201cappropriate \nand necessary to ensure affordable access,\u201d 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(h)(1)(B), the FCC adopted a discount level that \nvaried from 20 to 90% depending on poverty \nindicators.14 The FCC has also implemented a \nperiodically adjusted annual cap to fulfill Congress\u2019s \ndirective to establish a \u201cspecific, predictable and \nsufficient\u201d universal service support mechanism. 47 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 254(b)(5), (d), (e); see 1997 Universal \nService Order \u00b6 529. \nRural Health Care. In establishing the Rural \nHealth Care Program, the FCC implemented the \nstatutory requirement that rates be \u201creasonably \ncomparable,\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(h)(1)(A), by requiring \nthat they be \u201cno higher than the highest\u201d rate \ncharged in the nearest large city in the same state.15 \nFinally, the FCC implemented a $400 million cap on \nthe Rural Health Care program.16  \n2. The FCC also directed the creation of the \nUniversal \nService \nAdministrative \nCompany \nto \nprovide ministerial support for the Fund programs. \nThe FCC charged the Administrator with \u201cbilling \n \n12 See 1997 Universal Service Order \u00b6 28. \n13 See id. \u00b6 425. \n14 1997 Universal Service Order \u00b6 31. \n15 1997 Universal Service Order \u00b6 669. \n16 Id. \u00b6 35. \n\n10 \n \ncontributors, collecting contributions to the universal \nsupport mechanisms, and disbursing universal \nservice support funds.\u201d 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.702(b). The \nFCC forbade the Administrator from \u201cmak[ing] \npolicy\u201d or \u201cinterpret[ing] unclear provisions\u201d of the \nAct or FCC rules. Id. \u00a7 54.702(c). The FCC also \nrequired that the Administrator \u201cbe neutral and \nimpartial.\u201d17 The FCC noted that the Administrator\u2019s \nparent entity had been administering the High Cost \nFund for more than a decade when Congress passed \nthe 1996 Act.18  \nThe FCC established comprehensive oversight \nand control of the Administrator. The FCC required \nthat the Administrator: (1) submit its cost allocation \nmanual; (2) provide the FCC with full access to all \nthe data it collected; (3) file an annual report, \nincluding an itemization of monthly administrative \ncosts; and (4) submit quarterly reports on USF \ndisbursements. See 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.702(g), (h), (j)-(k). \n3. \nThe \nFCC \nalso \nimplemented \nCongress\u2019s \nrequirement \nthat \ntelecommunications \ncarriers \nproviding interstate telecommunications services \ncontribute to the universal service mechanisms. See \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(d). Each quarter, pursuant to \nSection 254(d), the FCC adopts a \u201ccontribution \nfactor\u201d that specifies the percentage of telecomm-\nunications \nproviders\u2019 \n\u201cend-user \ninterstate \nand \ninternational telecommunications revenues\u201d that \nmust be paid into the Fund. 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.709(a)(2). \n \n17 1997 Universal Service Order \u00b6 863. \n18 Changes to the Board of Directors of the National \nExchange Carrier Association, Inc., 13 FCC Rcd. 25058, \n\u00b6 14 (1998). \n\n11 \n \nThe contribution factor is calculated based on that \nquarter\u2019s ratio of projected universal service program \nexpenses to total eligible interstate and international \nrevenues (the \u201ccontribution base\u201d): \n \nUSF \nQuarterly \nContribution \nFactor \n= \nProjected USF Demand \n(Projected program support +  \nadministrative expenses) \nContribution Base \n(Total eligible interstate & \ninternational revenues \u2013 \nprojected contributions) \n \nDemand. To facilitate the FCC\u2019s determination, \nthe Administrator calculates and submits the \nprojected USF support amounts\u2014including \u201cthe \nbasis for those projections\u201d based on the FCC\u2019s \ndetailed rules for the programs\u2014at least sixty \ncalendar days before each quarter as well as its \nprojected administrative expenses. Id. \u00a7 54.709(a)(3); \nsee also Memorandum of Understanding Between the \nFederal \nCommunications \nCommission \nand \nthe \nUniversal Service Administrative Company \u00b6 13 \n(Oct. 17, 2024), https://www.fcc.gov/sites/default/files/\nusac-mou.pdf (\u201cFCC/USAC MOU\u201d). \nContribution Base. Next, at least 30 days before \nthe start of the quarter, the Administrator submits \nthe total \u201ccontribution base\u201d (i.e., providers\u2019 projected \ninterstate and international revenues) to the FCC. \n47 \nC.F.R. \n\u00a7 54.709(a)(3). \nThe \nAdministrator \ndetermines projected revenue based on quarterly \nreports from service providers. Pursuant to the \n\n12 \n \nMemorandum of Understanding between the FCC \nand the Administrator, the FCC\u2019s Office of Managing \nDirector must \u201creview the contribution base and \nprovide any necessary feedback to USAC before \nUSAC publicly files the contribution base with the \nFCC.\u201d FCC/USAC MOU \u00b6 13.  \nContribution Factor. After reviewing the demand \nand \ncontribution \nbase \nprojections \nfrom \nthe \nAdministrator, the FCC\u2014through its Office of \nManaging Director\u2014issues a public notice with a \nproposed contribution factor. \u201cThe Commission \nreserves the right to set projections of demand and \nadministrative expenses at amounts that the \nCommission \ndetermines \nwill \nserve \nthe \npublic \ninterest.\u201d 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.709(a)(3). If the FCC takes \nno further action within 14 days of the public notice, \nthe contribution factor is \u201cdeemed approved.\u201d Id.  \nWhile the contribution factor percentage has \nincreased over time, this increase is primarily due to \na decline in the contribution base (particularly the \nnumber of landline phones) rather than from \nsignificant growth in the Fund programs. Thus, USF \ndisbursements decreased from $8.71 billion in 2012 \nto $8.27 billion in 2020, while the contribution base \ndecreased from $65.9 billion in 2011 to $41.4 billion \nin 2020.19  \n4. The FCC has adjusted the four USF programs \nover time to reflect evolving technologies. The \ngrowing need for broadband support spurred the \nmost comprehensive reform of the USF programs. \nAfter Congress directed the FCC in 2009 to develop a \n \n19 See 2022 Future of USF Report \u00b6\u00b6 91-92. \n\n13 \n \nNational Broadband Plan to ensure every American \nhas \u201caccess to broadband capability,\u201d20 the FCC \nbegan to refocus Fund support from basic landline \nvoice telephone service to broadband deployment.21  \nToday, the High Cost program funds rural \nservices to consumers and businesses in every state \nand territory. Over 8.5 million households subscribe \nto the Lifeline program, including low-income \nhouseholds, Veterans, and people on tribal lands.22 \nFrom 2022 to 2024, over 106,000 schools and 12,500 \nlibraries received funding from the E-Rate program, \nbenefiting over 54 million students.23 From 2021 to \n2023, over 16,000 health care providers received \nfunding from the Rural Health Care program.24  \nD. This Litigation \nIn 2021, Respondents began challenging each \nsuccessive FCC quarterly contribution factor in the \nfederal courts of appeals. Respondents contended \nthat (1) Congress violated the nondelegation doctrine \nin granting the FCC authority regarding the \ncollection of contributions in support of universal \nservice in Section 254; and (2) the FCC violated the \nprivate nondelegation doctrine by relying on the \n \n20 2009 Recovery Act \u00a7 6001(k)(2). \n21 See, e.g., Connect America Fund, et al., 26 FCC Rcd. \n17663, \u00b6 115 (2011) (\u201c2011 USF Transformation Order\u201d). \n22 Program \nData: \nLifeline \nParticipation, \nUSAC, \nhttps://www.usac.org/lifeline/resources/program-data/ \n(last accessed Jan. 7, 2025) (figures from \u201cLifeline \nParticipation Rate\u201d Excel file). \n23 FCC, The Universal Service Fund: How It Impacts the \nUnited States, at 1 (2024). \n24 Id. \n\n14 \n \nAdministrator to calculate the projected demand and \ncontribution base that inform the FCC\u2019s quarterly \ncontribution factor. The Sixth and Eleventh Circuits \nrejected those challenges. See Pet. App. 14a, 127a; \nConsumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, 67 F.4th 773, 778 (6th Cir. \n2023), cert. denied, 144 S.

The panel \nreasoned that Section 254(b) \u201cexpressly requires\u201d the \nFCC to ensure compliance with the enumerated \nprinciples, and Congress therefore \u201cprovided ample \ndirection.\u201d Pet. App. 133a. The Fifth Circuit panel \nalso \nconcluded \nthat \nthere \nwas \nno \nprivate \nnondelegation violation because the Administrator \ncannot make policy, lacks rulemaking power, and \ncompletes all of its functions subject to FCC \nsupervision and review. See id. at 139a-40a. \nThe en banc Fifth Circuit, in a 9-7 vote, granted \nRespondents\u2019 petition for review. The majority first \nconsidered whether the challenge \u201cmight be moot\u201d \ngiven that \u201csovereign immunity may bar recovery of \nthe monies [Respondents] paid into USF.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 13a. It declined to reach that issue, however, \nconcluding that the challenge was justiciable \n\u201cbecause it is capable of repetition yet evading \nreview.\u201d Id. \nOn the merits, the court held the First Quarter \n2022 contribution factor unconstitutional.25 First, the \n \n25 The Fifth Circuit stayed the issuance of its mandate \npending this Court\u2019s disposition of a petition for a writ of \ncertiorari. See Order, Consumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, No. 22-\n60008 (5th Cir. Aug. 26, 2024). \n\n15 \n \ncourt concluded that USF contributions were a tax, \nnot a fee, and that Congress therefore delegated its \npower to tax\u2014a \u201ccore legislative power\u201d\u2014to the FCC. \nPet. App. 23a-24a. The court nevertheless recognized \nthat delegations by Congress to agencies are \npermissible so long as Congress provides an \nintelligible principle to guide the exercise of \ndelegated authority. See id. at 24a-25a. It further \nrecognized that this Court \u201chas not in the past \nseveral decades held that Congress failed to provide \na requisite intelligible principle.\u201d Id. at 25a-26a \n(quoting Jarkesy v. SEC, 34 F.4th 446, 462 (5th Cir. \n2022)). The Fifth Circuit did not conclude that \nSection 254 violated the nondelegation doctrine \nunder this Court\u2019s precedents. Instead, it expressed \n\u201cgrave concerns about \u00a7 254\u2019s constitutionality.\u201d Id. \nat 42a. \nAs \nto \nRespondents\u2019 \nprivate \nnondelegation \nchallenge, the Fifth Circuit found that the FCC\u2019s \nreliance on the Administrator was problematic for \ntwo reasons. It first stated that FCC regulations \npermit the Administrator\u2019s projections to take effect \n\u201cwithout formal FCC approval.\u201d Pet. App. 49a. It \nthen stated that the FCC has \u201cde facto abdicat[ed]\u201d \nits duty to supervise the Administrator. Id. at 50a. \nHowever, \nthe \nFifth \nCircuit \nstopped \nshort \nof \nconcluding \nthat \nthe \nFCC\u2019s \nreliance \non \nthe \nAdministrator was itself unconstitutional. See id. at \n55a. \nInstead, the court determined that it \u201cneed not \nresolve either question in this case \u2026 because the \ncombination of Congress\u2019s sweeping delegation to \nFCC and FCC\u2019s unauthorized subdelegation to USAC \nviolates the Legislative Vesting Clause in Article I, \n\u00a7 1.\u201d Id. at 64a. The Fifth Circuit read this Court\u2019s \n\n16 \n \nopinions in Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company \nAccounting Oversight Board, 561 U.S. 477 (2010), \nand Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau, 591 U.S. 197 (2020), to stand for \u201ca general \nprinciple that \u2026 two constitutional parts do not \nnecessarily add up to a constitutional whole.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 66a-67a. Reviewing Congress\u2019s delegation to the \nFCC and the Administrator\u2019s role through this lens, \nthe court concluded that the \u201ccombination of \ndelegations, subdelegations, and obfuscations of the \nUSF Tax mechanism offends Article I, \u00a7 1 of the \nConstitution.\u201d Id. at 81a. \nJudge \nStewart, \nwriting \nfor \nseven \njudges, \ndissented and argued that Section 254 provides an \nintelligible principle, imposing on the FCC \u201ca duty to \nweigh the enumerated universal service principles.\u201d \nId. at 92a. The dissent also noted that Sections \n254(c) and (e) limit the FCC\u2019s discretion as to the \neligible recipients and services. See id. at 93a-96a. \nThese factors \u201csatisfie[d] the intelligible principle \ntest as articulated by the Supreme Court.\u201d Id. at 96a. \nAs to the private nondelegation doctrine, the \ndissent explained that the Administrator\u2019s authority \nis limited to billing, collection, and distribution of \ncontributions, as well as collecting information from \ncontributors to calculate inputs for the FCC\u2019s \ncontribution-factor determination, applying formulas \nthat the FCC provides. See id. at 99a. Finally, the \ndissent highlighted that the FCC\u2019s control over the \nAdministrator is evident in regulations barring the \nlatter from making policy, interpreting rules, or \nissuing anything that has the force of law. Id. at \n100a. \nIn a second dissent, Judge Higginson, writing for \nfive judges, disagreed with the majority\u2019s \u201cnovel \n\n17 \n \ntheory\u201d of nondelegation. Id. at 115a. He explained \nthat this Court had previously considered cases that \nraised \nboth \npublic \nand \nprivate \nnondelegation \nchallenges, but \u201cnever instructed \u2026 that a different \nstandard applies\u201d in cases involving both issues. Id. \nat 116a (citing Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U.S. \n238, 311 (1936); Currin v. Wallace, 306 U.S. 1, 15-16 \n(1939); Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v. Adkins, 310 \nU.S. 381, 399 (1940)). \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n1. This case is not moot because it falls within the \n\u201ccapable of repetition yet evading review\u201d principle. \n2. In Section 254, Congress provided ample \ndirection to the Commission. This Court has never \napplied the nondelegation rule to strike down a \nstatute that provides intelligible principles as clear \nas those Congress provided here. Indeed, it has \napproved delegations that are far less detailed. \nMoreover, because Congress made the key policy \ndecisions, while instructing the FCC to engage in the \nkind of context-specific fact-finding that is not \ncontroversial under the nondelegation doctrine, the \nstatute \nsatisfies \nany \nreasonable \nalternative \nnondelegation test. See Gundy v. United States, 588 \nU.S. 128, 158 (2019) (Gorsuch, J., dissenting).  \n3. The Fifth Circuit significantly exaggerated the \nscope of the Administrator\u2019s responsibilities. In fact, \nthe FCC relies upon the Administrator only for \nministerial duties and retains control over all of the \nAdministrator\u2019s \nactions. \nIn \nparticular, \nthe \nAdministrator\u2019s role in connection with the FCC\u2019s \nadoption of the quarterly contribution factor is to \ncollect data and make projections pursuant to \ndetailed FCC rules. It would be surprising if the \n\n18 \n \nCommission needed to revise the Administrator\u2019s \nprojections frequently. \n4. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s \u201ccombination\u201d approach fails \nhere, where both Congress\u2019s delegation and the \nFCC\u2019s reliance on the Administrator raise no serious \nconstitutional issue. In addition, no precedent \nsupports the use of a combination approach outside \nthe removal context.  \nMoreover, the reasoning of Free Enterprise Fund \nis inapplicable to nondelegation cases. In that case, \nthe Court identified a structural problem: the \ncombination of tenure protection at two levels meant \nthat \u201c[n]either the President \u2026 nor even an officer \nwhose conduct he may review only for good cause, \nha[d] full control over\u201d the entity at issue in that \ncase. 561 U.S. at 496. In contrast, the FCC has full \nauthority \nto \ncontrol \nthe \nAdministrator, \neven \nassuming (contrary to fact) that it is not adequately \nsupervising that entity under current rules. There is \nthus no structural problem analogous to the problem \nthe Court identified in Free Enterprise Fund.  \nARGUMENT \nI. This Case Is Not Moot. \nThe Fifth Circuit correctly found the injury \nalleged by the petitioners in that court capable of \nrepetition yet evading review. Pet. App. 13a. The \nFCC adopts the contribution factor each quarter, and \nthe three months during which the contribution \nmust be paid is too little time for \u201cconsidered plenary \nreview in this Court.\u201d Neb. Press Ass\u2019n v. Stuart, 427 \nU.S. 539, 547 (1976). \nThis Court has never held that a challenger must \nexhaust every potential avenue for preliminary relief \n\n19 \n \nfor this exception to mootness to apply. And while \nsome courts have denied application of the exception \nwhere a challenger\u2019s \u201cprocedural missteps \u2026 prevent \njudicial review,\u201d Protestant Mem\u2019l Med. Ctr., Inc. v. \nMaram, 471 F.3d 724, 731 (7th Cir. 2006), this is not \nsuch a case. The challengers filed their petition for \nreview promptly after the FCC adopted the First \nQuarter 2022 contribution factor. The FCC collects \ncontributions on a monthly basis,26 and those \ncollections are used for ongoing Fund operations, \nincluding disbursements to recipients of Fund \nsupport. In this context, mandating that a challenger \nseek a stay of the contribution factor to bring any \nchallenge would be extremely disruptive given the \ngrave harm that could ensue for other stakeholders. \nParticularly here, where there is no dispute that the \nobligation to contribute recurs on a clear, periodic \nbasis (as it has for many years), there is no benefit to \ndenying application of this mootness exception.  \nIf the Court does find the case moot, it should \nvacate the judgment below under its \u201cwell settled\u201d \nMunsingwear practice. Acheson Hotels, LLC v. \nLaufer, 601 U.S. 1, 5 (2023); see United States v. \nMunsingwear, Inc., 340 U.S. 36 (1950). If the case is \nmoot, it occurred before the Fifth Circuit decision, \nand that decision should not be binding in that \ncircuit.  \n \n26 See, e.g., How to Pay, USAC, https://www.usac.org/\nservice-providers/making-payments/how-to-pay/ (last upd-\nated Oct. 2024) (\u201cUSF payments are due on the 15th of \neach month.\u201d). \n\n20 \n \nII. Congress Provided Ample Direction to the \nFCC Regarding the Universal Service Fund.  \nSection 254 passes muster under any plausible \nunderstanding of the limits the Constitution places \non delegation to agencies.  \nA. Section 254 Provides Extensive Guidance \nto the FCC. \nWhen Congress adopted Section 254 in 1996, it \nwas well aware that the FCC had previously created \nhigh-cost and lifeline programs, relying in part on \nCongress\u2019s direction that the Commission \u201cmake \navailable, so far as possible, to all the people of the \nUnited States \u2026 a rapid, efficient, Nation-wide, and \nworld-wide wire and radio communications service \nwith adequate facilities at reasonable charges,\u201d 47 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 151.27 Congress also recognized that the \npre-1996 Act universal service regime relied on \nimplicit subsidies under which some customers paid \nhigher fees to keep rates affordable for other, lower-\nincome and higher-cost consumers.  \nBecause implicit subsidies cannot survive in a \ncompetitive environment, Congress in the 1996 Act \ndirected the FCC to move to an explicit subsidy \nregime. See 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(e). And, to create the \nnecessary parameters for such a new regime, \n \n27 See also 1997 Universal Service Order \u00b6 329 (citing 47 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151, 154(i), 201, and 205 in summarizing pre-\n1996 Act authority); see NARUC, 737 F.2d at 1108 n.6 \n(rejecting argument that FCC had no authority over \nuniversal service because, in 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 151, \u201cCongress \ndirected that, \u2018so far as possible, ... all people of the \nUnited States\u2019 are to have adequate telephone facilities at \nreasonable prices\u201d). \n\n21 \n \nSection 254 provided significantly more statutory \ndirection as to the key inputs that determine the size \nof the universal service fund and thus the amount of \nthe quarterly contribution factor.  \nCongress specified the entities that must pay into \nthe regime: \u201cEvery telecommunications carrier that \nprovides interstate telecommunications services\u201d \nmust contribute toward the universal service \nmechanisms created under the statute. Id. \u00a7 254(d).28 \nCongress further provided that those payments must \nbe \u201cequitable and nondiscriminatory.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(d).  \nCongress \nlikewise \nconstrained \nthe \nFCC\u2019s \nauthority as to the services that could be part of the \n\u201cuniversal service\u201d program. While giving the FCC \nthe authority to determine the \u201cevolving level\u201d of \nservices that should be covered, Congress generally \nlimited \nthe \nagency \nto \nsupporting \n\u201ctelecomm-\nunications services\u201d\u2014a statutorily defined term that \ninvolves common carriage29\u2014as well as other \n \n28 Congress allowed the FCC to expand this class to \ninclude \u201cproviders of interstate telecommunications\u201d if it \nmade an appropriate public interest finding. See id.; see \nalso 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 153(50), (53) (defining \u201ctelecomm-\nunications\u201d and \u201ctelecommunications service\u201d). The FCC \nhas exercised that authority only to a limited degree to \nadd, for instance, payphone providers and interconnected \nVoice over Internet Protocol services to the class of \ncontributors. See 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.706(a).  \n29 See 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 153(53) (defining \u201ctelecommunications \nservice\u201d as \u201cthe offering of telecommunications for a fee \ndirectly to the public, or to such classes of users as to be \neffectively available directly to the public, regardless of \nthe facilities used\u201d). \n\n22 \n \nservices, including broadband, if they are provided \nover the same \u201cfacilities.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(c)(1), (e).30 \nCongress also mandated that, in deciding on the \ncovered services, the agency evaluate the extent to \nwhich such services \u201care essential to education, \npublic \nhealth, \nor \npublic \nsafety,\u201d \nhave \n\u201cbeen \nsubscribed to by a substantial majority of residential \ncustomers,\u201d and \u201care being deployed in public \ntelecommunications networks by telecommunications \ncarriers, as well as being \u201cconsistent with the public \ninterest, convenience, and necessity.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(c)(1).31  \nCongress \nalso \nspecified \nwho \nmay \nreceive \nsubsidies: \u201c[O]nly an eligible telecommunications \ncarrier designated under [47 U.S.C. \u00a7 214(e)] shall be \neligible to receive specific Federal universal service \nsupport.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(e); see id. \u00a7 214(e) \n(enumerating criteria for eligible telecommunications \ncarriers). For particular programs, Congress also \ndefined the customers whose services must be \n \n30 See \n2011 \nUSF \nTransformation \nOrder \n\u00b6\u00b6 64-65 \n(\u201cSection 254(e) thus contemplates that carriers may \nreceive federal support to enable the deployment of \nbroadband \nfacilities \nused \nto \nprovide \nsupported \ntelecommunications services as well as other services.\u201d), \naff\u2019d, In re FCC 11-161, 753 F.3d 1015 (10th Cir. 2014); \nsee IIJA \u00a7 60104(c)(1)-(3) (directing that the FCC \u201cmay \nnot in any way reduce the congressional mandate to \nachieve the universal service goal for broadband\u201d). \n31 Congress also authorized the FCC to designate \nadditional services for support for schools, libraries, and \nhealth care providers that serve the purposes of \nSection 254(h). See id. \u00a7 254(c)(3); Tex. Off. of Pub. Util. \nCouns. v. FCC, 183 F.3d 393, 441 (5th Cir. 1999) \n(\u201cTOPUC I\u201d).  \n\n23 \n \ndiscounted \nbased \non \nthat \nsupport. \nSee \nid. \n\u00a7 254(h)(1)(A)-(B) (for Rural Health Care program, \n\u201cany public or nonprofit health care provider that \nserves persons who reside in rural areas in that \nState,\u201d \nand \nfor \nE-Rate, \n\u201celementary \nschools, \nsecondary schools, and libraries\u201d).  \nBeyond \nthis, \nin \nSection \n254(b), \nCongress \nspecifically identified the principles (quoted in full \nsupra pp.4-6) the FCC should advance in making its \njudgments implementing the statute. A number of \nthese principles are especially relevant to limiting \nthe size of the universal service fund, and thus the \namount of the quarterly contribution factor. The \nrequirement in Section 254(b)(1) that quality service \nremain \u201caffordable\u201d32 is significant because, as the \nFCC has explained, \u201cif the universal service burden \nis too high, the affordability of service will be placed \nin jeopardy, undermining the very purpose of the \nuniversal service program.\u201d33  \nLikewise, the principle enunciated in Section \n254(b)(5) (and Section 254(d)) that USF mechanisms \nbe not only \u201cspecific\u201d and \u201cpredictable,\u201d but also \n\u201csufficient\u201d imposes an obligation to ensure that the \nFund is large enough, but not too large, to achieve \nthe statutory goals. Addressing judicial decisions \ndiscussing the text of Section 254, the FCC thus \ndefined the term to mean \u201can affordable and \nsustainable amount of support that is adequate, but \n \n32 See also 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(i) (\u201cThe Commission \u2026 should \nensure that universal service is available at rates that are \njust, reasonable, and affordable.\u201d). \n33 Lifeline and Link Up Reform and Modernization, et al., \n27 \nFCC \nRcd. \n6656, \n\u00b6 37 \n(2012) \n(\u201c2012 \nLifeline \nModernization Order\u201d).  \n\n24 \n \nno greater than necessary, to achieve the goals of the \nuniversal service program.\u201d34 The Fifth Circuit itself \nhas read this language to confirm that \u201cexcessive \nfunding \nmay \nitself \nviolate \nthe \nsufficiency \nrequirements.\u201d Alenco Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v. FCC, 201 \nF.3d 608, 620 (5th Cir. 2000).  \nSection \n254, \nmoreover, \nprovides \nadditional \nspecific guidance as to the amount that universal \nservice subsidies should reduce end-user rates, again \nlimiting the potential size of the universal service \nfund. Supported services for consumers in high-cost \nareas and low-income consumers should be \u201cat rates \nthat are reasonably comparable to rates charged for \nsimilar service in urban areas.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(b)(3). \nRural health care providers should be served at rates \n\u201creasonably comparable\u201d to those for similar services \nin urban areas in the same state. Id. \u00a7 254(h)(1)(A). \nSchools and libraries \u201cshall\u201d receive service at \u201crates \nless than the amounts charged for similar services to \nother parties,\u201d through a discount \u201cappropriate and \nnecessary to ensure affordable access to and use of \nsuch services.\u201d Id. \u00a7 254(h)(1)(B). And for access to \n\u201cadvanced \nservices\u201d\u2014which \nincludes \nbroadband \nInternet \naccess \nfor \nschools, \nlibraries, \nand \nhospitals35\u2014the statute directs the FCC to establish \nrules that account for what is \u201ceconomically \nreasonable.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(h)(2)(A). Four years ago, \nCongress passed legislation confirming the FCC\u2019s \n \n34 High Cost Universal Service Support, et al., 25 FCC \nRcd. 4072, \u00b6\u00b6 3, 30 (2010) (emphasis added). \n35 See Modernizing the E-rate Program for Schools and \nLibraries, 29 FCC Rcd. 8870, \u00b6\u00b6 68-70 (2014); Rural \nHealth Care Support Mechanism, 27 FCC Rcd. 16778, \n\u00b6 39 (2012). \n\n25 \n \n\u201ccongressional mandate to achieve the universal \nservice goal for broadband\u201d and tasking the FCC \nwith preparing a report on how to improve the \nFund.36 \nConsistent \nwith \nthis \nsubstantial \nlegislative \nguidance, the FCC has repeatedly concluded that \nSection 254 constrains the Commission\u2019s decision-\nmaking. For instance, the FCC has established \nannual monetary caps for the USF programs to fulfill \nits \u201cstatutory obligation to create a specific, \npredictable, and sufficient universal service support \nmechanism.\u201d37 Likewise, the FCC declined to extend \nsupport to rural home care providers, explaining that \nSection 254(h) limited support to statutorily defined \nhealth care providers.38 Similarly, just last year, the \nFCC rejected calls for it to support certain broadband \nwireless technologies because, as it explained, it \n\u201cremain[s] focused on the statutory obligation to \nestablish rules that enhance access to the extent it is \n\u2018economically reasonable.\u2019\u201d39  \nMoreover, \ncontrary \nto \nthe \nFifth \nCircuit\u2019s \nsuggestion that Section 254 is so lacking in guidance \nthat \u201cno reviewing court could ever possibly \ninvalidate any FCC action,\u201d Pet. App. 40a-41a, the \nFifth Circuit and other federal courts have enforced \nSection 254\u2019s limits on multiple occasions. See, e.g., \n \n36 IIJA \u00a7 60104(c)(1)-(3). \n37 1997 Universal Service Order \u00b6 529 (establishing initial \ncap for the E-Rate program); id. \u00b6 705 (establishing initial \ncap for the Rural Health Care program). \n38 Id. \u00b6 656. \n39 Addressing the Homework Gap Through the E-Rate \nProgram, FCC 24-76, WC Docket No. 21-31, \u00b6 25 \n(rel.

Raimondo, 144 S. Ct. 2244 \n(2024). That decision reinforces the importance of the \nstatutory guardrails that courts can and do impose \nby enforcing the extensive prescriptive language of \nSection 254.

The Fifth Circuit\u2019s Contrary Assessment \nof Section 254 Disregards the Significant \nConstraints on FCC Discretion. \nThe Fifth Circuit majority\u2019s contrary analysis of \nSection 254 is inconsistent with the statute\u2019s text \nand surrounding context.  \nTo begin, the Fifth Circuit suggests that \nSection 254\u2019s definition of \u201cuniversal service\u201d is not \n\u201cmeaningful\u201d because the concept of \u201cuniversal \nservice\u201d \nis \nnot \n\u201csufficiently \nintelligible.\u201d \nPet. \nApp. 26a. But the statutory text belies that \nconclusion. As noted above, Congress defined \nuniversal service to be an evolving level of \n\u201ctelecommunications services,\u201d which is a defined \nterm, see 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 153(53), and the statute \ngenerally authorizes support only for those services \nand other services such as broadband that use the \nsupported \nfacilities. \nSee \nid. \n\u00a7 254(e); \nsupra \npp.21-22.40 \nIn \naddition, \nSection 254(c) \nspecifies \nnearly \nmathematical criteria for FCC use in determining \nwhether a particular service qualifies for universal \nservice support. As noted, those criteria include \nwhether the service is subscribed to \u201cby a substantial \nmajority of residential customers\u201d and is \u201cbeing \ndeployed in public telecommunications networks by \ntelecommunications \ncarriers.\u201d \n47 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(c)(1)(B)-(C).  \n \n40 As noted above, Section 254(c) authorizes the FCC to \nprovide additional support for schools, libraries, and \nhealth care providers, but only where that is consistent \nwith the policies in Section 254(h). See supra n.31. \n\n28 \n \nSection 254(c) further mandates that the FCC \nconsider whether a particular service is \u201cessential to \neducation, \npublic \nhealth, \nor \npublic \nsafety.\u201d \nId. \u00a7 254(c)(1)(A). \nAlthough \nthe \nFifth \nCircuit \nsuggested without explanation that \u201cessential\u201d is not \na meaningful direction, Pet. App. 29a, that is a \ncommon word that can be readily understood in \naccordance with its plain meaning. See American \nHeritage Dictionary (5th ed. 2022) (\u201c1. Constituting \nor being part of the nature or essence of something; \ninherent \n\u2026 \n2. Fundamentally \nimportant \nor \nnecessary \u2026 .\u201d). The FCC thus readily applied that \nterm in 1997 in establishing nine core services \nsupported \nby \nthe \nfederal \nuniversal \nservice \nmechanisms.41 For instance, the FCC concluded that \nsingle-party service was \u201cessential to public health \nand safety in that it allows residential consumers \naccess to emergency services without delay.\u201d42  \nBeyond that, as discussed above and as the Fifth \nCircuit previously explained, the fact that support \nshould be \u201csufficient\u201d to preserve and advance \nuniversal service itself limits the Fund to enough \nsupport, but not too much, to achieve Congress\u2019s \nobjectives. See supra pp.23-24. Although, as the Fifth \nCircuit noted, that requirement may not mandate \nsupport that precisely \u201c\u2018equal[s] the actual costs \nincurred\u2019\u201d by each carrier, Pet. App. 27a (quoting \nTOPUC I, 183 F.3d at 412), that is far from failing to \nprovide any meaningful limitation on FCC action. \nIndeed, in the portion of TOPUC I the circuit court \nmajority cited, the Fifth Circuit noted that, as used \nin Section 254, \u201csufficiency\u201d was a \u201cdirect statutory \n \n41 See 1997 Universal Service Order \u00b6\u00b6 61-83. \n42 Id. \u00b6 62. \n\n29 \n \ncommand.\u201d Id. at 95a. And in that case, the Fifth \nCircuit approved the FCC\u2019s use of \u201cforward-looking \ncosts\u201d rather than historical costs, which reduces the \namount of support carriers receive and the size of the \nFund. See 183 F.3d at 411; see also Verizon \nCommc\u2019ns v. FCC, 535 U.S. 467, 475 (2002) \n(affirming the FCC\u2019s reliance on forward-looking \ncosts to set just and reasonable rates under 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 252(d)(1), which was also part of the 1996 Act).  \nSimilarly, the specific principles that Congress \nrequired the FCC to \u201cbase\u201d its \u201cpolicies\u201d on in \nSection 254(b) cannot be disregarded on the basis \nthat they are \u201caspirational.\u201d Pet. App. 28a. While it \nis undoubtedly the case that those principles cannot \n\u201coverrid[e] other portions of the Act,\u201d TOPUC I, 183 \nF.3d at 421, the FCC in fact \u201cmust work to achieve \neach one unless there is a direct conflict between it \nand either another listed principle or some other \nobligation or limitation on the FCC\u2019s authority.\u201d \nQwest, 258 F.3d at 1199.  \nTo be sure, as the Fifth Circuit noted (Pet. App. \n28a), the FCC has authority to adopt additional \nprinciples. Those principles themselves, however, \nmust \nbe \n\u201cnecessary \nand appropriate \nfor \nthe \nprotection of the public interest\u201d and \u201cconsistent with \nthis chapter,\u201d which includes all the limitations \ndiscussed above. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(b)(7). Accordingly, \nin nearly three decades, the FCC has adopted only \ntwo \nsuch \nprinciples\u2014advancing \ncompetitive \nneutrality and using universal service funds to \nsupport advanced services\u2014both of which the FCC \nadopted because they are deeply grounded in the text \n\n30 \n \nof the statute.43 No party has challenged the FCC\u2019s \njudgments on those points in this case. \nSection 254 plainly does not permit the FCC to \nuse the Fund \u201cto create an endowment \u2026 to fund \nwhatever projects it might like.\u201d Pet App. 27a. \nCarriers may use universal service funding \u201conly for \nthe provision, maintenance, and upgrading of \nfacilities and services for which the support is \nintended.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(e). And as discussed, \nSection 254 limits which services qualify as part of \n\u201cuniversal service.\u201d See 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(c). \nNor is there significant ambiguity regarding \n\u201cwhich \nschools \nand \nlibraries \nshould \nreceive \nsubsidized services.\u201d Pet. App. 29a. The statute \nmakes clear that all schools and libraries that are \neligible and that meet the statutory definition should \nreceive subsidized service. Section 254(h)(1)(B) states \nthat \u201c[a]ll telecommunications carriers\u201d receiving a \n\u201cbona fide\u201d request from \u201celementary schools, \nsecondary schools, and libraries,\u201d \u201cshall\u201d provide the \nrelevant \nsupported \nservices \nat \nthe \nrelevant \ndiscounted rate. (emphases added). See also 47 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 254(h)(4), (h)(7)(A) (defining elementary and \nsecondary school and providing criteria for school \nand library eligibility).  \nNor was the Fifth Circuit correct in suggesting \neither \nthat \n(1) \u201cthe \nonly \nreal \nconstraint\u201d \nis \nSection 254(b)(1)\u2019s reference to rates remaining \n\u201caffordable\u201d or (2) that that term is \u201cno guidance \nwhatsoever.\u201d Pet. App. 30a (internal quotation marks \nomitted). As explained, there are multiple additional \n \n43 See 1997 Universal Service Order \u00b6 43; 2011 USF \nTransformation Order \u00b6\u00b6 10, 44, 64-65. \n\n31 \n \nconstraints on the size of the universal service \ncontribution factor. See supra pp.20-24. Moreover, \nand \ncontrary \nto \nthe \nFifth \nCircuit \nmajority\u2019s \nunderstanding, the word \u201caffordable\u201d is not rendered \nmeaningless when a product is so necessary that \ndemand is \u201cuncommonly inelastic.\u201d Pet. App. 30a. \nThe FCC resolved this precise issue nearly 30 years \nago, concluding that it must \u201cconsider both the \nabsolute and relative components when making the \naffordability determinations required under section \n254.\u201d44 In determining affordability, it thus must \nassess not only rates, but also \u201cnon-rate factors, such \nas consumer income levels, that can be used to assess \nthe financial burden\u201d created by subscribing to a \nparticular service.45   \nC. Section 254 Is Consistent with Precedent \nand Constitutional History and Would \nSatisfy Any Reasonable Nondelegation \nTest. \nPrecedent strongly supports the conclusion that \nSection 254 does not improperly delegate legislative \npower in violation of Article I, Section 1\u2019s Vesting \nClause. That is equally true even under the more \nrestrictive delegation standards advocated by some \nJustices. \n1. \nAlthough \nthe \nVesting \nClause \nprohibits \ndelegating Congress\u2019s unique legislative power to an \nagency, it has long been established that Congress \nmay lawfully delegate \u201cthe authority to make policies \nand rules that implement its statutes.\u201d Loving v. \nUnited States, 517 U.S. 748, 771 (1996). Thus, the \n \n44 1997 Universal Service Order \u00b6 110.  \n45 Id. \n\n32 \n \nCourt has repeatedly held that there is no \nconstitutional issue where Congress identifies an \n\u201c\u2018intelligible principle\u2019 to guide the delegee\u2019s exercise \nof authority.\u201d Gundy, 588 U.S. at 145 (plurality) \n(quoting J.W. Hampton, Jr., & Co. v. United States, \n276 U.S. 394, 409 (1928)). And as the Court has \nexplained in language that is particularly apt for the \nfast-changing world of telecommunications, \u201cin our \nincreasingly complex society, replete with ever \nchanging and more technical problems, Congress \nsimply cannot do its job absent an ability to delegate \npower under broad general directives.\u201d Mistretta v. \nUnited States, 488 U.S. 361, 372 (1989).  \nThe \nCourt\u2019s \napplication \nof \nthat \nprinciple \ndemonstrates that Section 254 is a permissible \ndelegation. The Court, for instance, has upheld the \nFCC\u2019s issuance of regulations governing radio \nlicensing based on the \u201cpublic interest, convenience, \nor necessity.\u201d NBC v. United States, 319 U.S. 190, \n215 (1943) (citing 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 307(a), (d), 309(a), \n310, 312). In so doing, the Court rejected the claim \nthat the \u201cpublic interest\u201d standard is \u201cso vague and \nindefinite\u201d that the \u201cdelegation is unconstitutional,\u201d \nexplaining that \u201c\u2018[t]he purpose of the Act, the \nrequirements it imposes, and the context of the \nprovision\u2019\u201d make the statutory language more than a \n\u201c\u2018mere general reference to public welfare.\u2019\u201d Id. at \n225-26 (quoting Fed. Radio Comm\u2019n v. Nelson Bros. \nBond & Mortg. Co., 289 U.S. 266, 285 (1933)).  \nAs discussed above, the specific directions \nimposed by the text of Section 254 are far more \nreticulated \nand \nprescriptive \nthan \nthe \n\u201cpublic \ninterest\u201d standard upheld in NBC. See NARUC, 737 \nF.2d at 1129. Indeed, as it codified what services \nshould be supported, Congress mandated that the \n\n33 \n \nFCC consider a number of factual considerations in \naddition to the public interest. See 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(c)(1) (FCC \u201cshall consider\u201d what services are \n\u201cessential\u201d to education, health, or safety; are being \n\u201csubscribed \nto \nby \na \nsubstantial \nmajority \nof \nresidential consumers\u201d; and are being \u201cdeployed in \npublic telecommunications networks\u201d). Beyond that, \nCongress provided guidance as to what kinds of \nservices could be supported; which entities should be \nassessed to support those services; how those entities \nshould be assessed; and how much support could be \nrequired, among many other things. See, e.g., id. \n\u00a7 254(d), (e), (h). Unlike the statutory text at issue in \nNBC, \nSection \n254 \nexplicitly \nenumerates \nsix \nprinciples Congress sought to advance. See id. \n\u00a7 254(b). And, as in NBC, these provisions must be \nunderstood in the context of the goals of the 1996 Act \nand the FCC\u2019s history of universal service regulation.  \nNBC is only one of a number of cases to approve \ndelegations through language that is far more \ngeneral than that at issue here. Many of those cases \ninvolve public utility regulations setting rates. See, \ne.g., Sunshine Anthracite, 310 U.S. at 398 (approving \ndelegation to set coal prices because \u201cappropriate-\nness of the criterion of the \u2018public interest\u2019 in various \ncontexts \u2026 make it clear that there is a valid \ndelegation of authority in this case\u201d); Yakus v. United \nStates, 321 U.S. 414, 420 (1944) (upholding authority \nof Administrator to promulgate regulations fixing \nprices of commodities that \u201c\u2018in his judgment will be \ngenerally fair and equitable and will effectuate the \npurposes of this Act\u2019 when, in his judgment, their \nprices \u2018have risen or threaten to rise to an extent or \nin a manner inconsistent with the purposes of this \nAct\u2019\u201d) (quoting statute); see also Whitman v. Am. \nTrucking Ass\u2019ns, 531 U.S. 457, 472 (2001) (approving \n\n34 \n \ndelegation to the EPA to set \u201cambient air quality \nstandards\u201d that \u201care requisite to protect the public \nhealth\u201d).  \nContrary \nto \nthe \nFifth \nCircuit \nmajority\u2019s \nsuggestion, NBC cannot be disregarded on the basis \nthat the \u201cpublic owns the airwaves,\u201d so that \u201cprivate \npeople may use that resource only on terms the \ngovernment sets.\u201d Pet. App. 35a-36a (cleaned up). \nThe Executive has not exercised unique authority to \nact there without a congressional delegation: \u201cBefore \n1927, the allocation of frequencies was left entirely to \nthe private sector,\u201d and Congress established the \nFederal Radio Commission \u201cto allocate frequencies \namong competing applicants.\u201d Red Lion Broad. Co. v. \nFCC, 395 U.S. 367, 375-77 (1969). Perhaps for that \nreason, the Fifth Circuit cites no language from NBC \nor any other case invoking such reasoning.  \nThe Fifth Circuit also erred in suggesting that, \nunlike in the many other cases where this Court has \napproved delegations far less constrained than the \none at issue here, the FCC lacks any \u201cspecial agency \nexpertise\u201d \nrelevant \nto \nuniversal \nservice. \nPet. \nApp. 40a. In fact, this Court has for nearly a century \nacknowledged the FCC\u2019s (and its predecessor\u2019s) \nexpertise \nin \nthe \nfast-changing \nworld \nof \ntelecommunications and technology. See Nelson Bros. \nBond & Mortg. Co., 289 U.S. at 276 (\u201cCongress \nestablished the Commission as its instrumentality to \nprovide continuous and expert supervision and to \nexercise the administrative judgment essential in \napplying \nlegislative \nstandards \nto \na \nhost \nof \ninstances.\u201d); FCC v. Nat\u2019l Citizens Comm. for Broad., \n436 U.S. 775, (1978) (deference warranted for FCC\u2019s \npredictive factual determinations, as \u201cforecast[s] of \nthe direction in which future public interest lies \n\n35 \n \nnecessarily involves deductions based on the expert \nknowledge of the agency\u201d) (internal quotation \nomitted). Congress explicitly invoked that expertise \nin asking the FCC to \u201cestablish\u201d the \u201cevolving level of \ntelecommunications \nservices\u201d \nthat \nconstitute \nuniversal service, \u201ctaking into account advances in \ntelecommunications and information technologies \nand services.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(c).  \nThe \nFifth \nCircuit\u2019s \nsuggestion \nthat \nthe \nconstitutional analysis is different here because the \nUSF contributions are allegedly a \u201ctax\u201d likewise runs \ncounter to this Court\u2019s precedents. Pet. App. 19a-23a. \nThe Court has held that there is no \u201cdifferent and \nstricter nondelegation doctrine in cases where \nCongress delegates discretionary authority to the \nExecutive under its taxing power.\u201d Skinner v. Mid-\nAm. Pipeline Co., 490 U.S. 212, 222-23 (1989). \n2. Section 254 does not raise the same issues \nthat concerned the Justices who dissented in Gundy. \nThe statute in Gundy allowed the Attorney General \nto \n\u201cspecify \nthe \napplicability\u201d \nof \nregistration \nrequirements to sex offenders convicted before the \nstatute\u2019s passage and \u201cprescribe rules.\u201d 588 U.S. at \n151, 177 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting). Justice Gorsuch \nconcluded that the statutory language \u201cgave the \nAttorney General free rein to write the rules for \nvirtually the entire existing sex offender population \nin this country.\u201d Id. at 151. Section 254, as discussed \nabove, bears no resemblance to that kind of \nlanguage.  \nLikewise, \nSection \n254 \nwould \nsatisfy \nthe \nalternative test proposed by Justice Gorsuch in \nGundy. In particular, Congress has \u201cannounced the \ncontrolling general polic[ies]\u201d underlying Section 254. \nId. at 157. Among other things, Congress has: \n\n36 \n \n\u2022 Made the decision to support universal service \nand told the FCC what factors to consider in \ndetermining \nwhich \nparticular \n\u201ctelecomm-\nunications services\u201d and associated facilities to \nsupport. See 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(c)(1), (e).  \n\u2022 Defined which entities must pay fees to \nsupport universal service. See id. \u00a7 254(d).  \n\u2022 Established which entities are eligible to \nreceive universal service support, criteria \nthose entities must meet, and for what \nservices they can use that funding. See id. \n\u00a7\u00a7 214(e), 254(e).  \n\u2022 Adopted a series of principles that the FCC \nmust follow in making decisions under \nSection 254. See id. \u00a7 254(b)(1)-(6). \n\u2022 Created, through those principles and other \nexplicit statutory text, meaningful limits on \nthe extent to which specific services can be \nfunded, thus limiting the size of the fund. \nSee supra pp.21-24.  \nIn all these instances, Congress has \u201cset forth \nstandards \u2018sufficiently definite and precise to enable \nCongress, the courts, and the public to ascertain\u2019 \nwhether Congress\u2019s guidance has been followed.\u201d \nGundy, 588 U.S. at 158 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting) \n(quoting Yakus, 321 U.S. at 426). \nThe decisions left to the FCC are thus reasonably \nunderstood to be authorizations to apply the \nstatutory text and policies to evolving factual \ncircumstances\u2014or, in other words, to \u201c\u2018fill up the \ndetails.\u2019\u201d Id. at 157 (quoting Wayman v. Southard, 23 \nU.S. 1, 43 (1825)); see id. at 158 (agencies permitted \nto engage in \u201cfact-finding\u201d). The FCC determines, for \ninstance, what services have \u201cbeen subscribed to by a \n\n37 \n \nsubstantial majority of residential customers\u201d and \nare \u201cbeing deployed in public telecommunications \nnetworks by telecommunications carriers.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(c)(1)(B)-(C); see, e.g., 1997 Universal Service \nOrder \u00b6 63 (concluding voice service should be \ncovered \u201cconsistent with section 254(c)(1)\u201d); 2012 \nLifeline Modernization Order \u00b6\u00b6 397-98 (declining to \nmake payphones eligible for Lifeline support upon \nfinding that they were not used by a substantial \nmajority of residential consumers).  \nThe \nagency \nlikewise \ndetermines \nwhat \nis \nnecessary for health care providers and those living \nin high-cost areas to have access at rates that are \n\u201creasonably comparable\u201d to access in urban areas, 47 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 254(b)(3), (h)(1)(A), and for schools and \nlibraries to have access at rates \u201cless than the \namounts charged for similar services to other \nparties,\u201d id. \u00a7 254(h)(1)(B). For instance, in the Rural \nHealth Care program, the FCC determines what \nconstitutes sufficient funding by subtracting the \nurban rate in the state from the rural rate for similar \n(i.e., \u201creasonably comparable\u201d) services. See 47 C.F.R. \n\u00a7\u00a7 54.603-605. \nSimilarly, \nthe \nFCC \nfulfills \nits \nstatutory directive in the E-Rate program through its \n\u201clowest corresponding price\u201d rules. See id. \u00a7\u00a7 54.500, \n54.511(b) (prohibiting providers from submitting bids \nhigher than the price charged to non-residential \ncustomers that are similarly situated to the \nparticular school or library \u201cfor similar services\u201d). \nThe fact that the FCC\u2019s granular implementation of \nthe program flows directly from the statutory \ndirectives cannot be squared with the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \nconclusion that Congress left the agency at sea, \nwithout significant guidance. \n\n38 \n \n3. The delegation of authority in Section 254 is \nalso consistent with the practice of the early \nCongresses, \nwhich \nthis \nCourt \nhas \nrepeatedly \nemphasized are a good guide to the original \nunderstanding of the Constitution. See, e.g., Bowsher \nv. Synar, 478 U.S. 714, 723-24 (1986).  \nThe practice of those Congresses demonstrates \nthat the Founders understood that delegations far \nbroader than the one at issue here were consistent \nwith the constitutional structure. For instance, the \nFirst Congress passed a bill to authorize the \nPresident of the Senate, the Chief Justice, the \nSecretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, \nand the Attorney General (or any three of them), to \npurchase an unspecified amount of certain debt \nwith the approbation of the President of the \nUnited States \u2026 in such manner, and under \nsuch regulations as shall appear to them best \ncalculated to fulfill the intent of this act: \nProvided, That the same be made openly, and \nwith due regard to the equal benefit of the \nseveral states \u2026 .  \nAct of Aug. 12, 1790, ch. 47, \u00a7 2, 1 Stat. 186, 186.  \nSimilarly, in 1798, the Fifth Congress\u2014which \nstill included in its ranks many Framers46\u2014adopted \na direct tax to be apportioned among the states. \n \n46 See Nevada Comm\u2019n on Ethics v. Carrigan, 564 U.S. \n117, 122 (2011) (\u201c[e]arly congressional enactments \nprovide contemporaneous and weighty evidence of the \nConstitution\u2019s meaning,\u201d and finding it \u201cdispositive\u201d that \n\u201c[w]ithin 15 years of the founding, both the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate adopted \u2026 rules\u201d akin to \nthose at issue in the case) (cleaned up). \n\n39 \n \nSee Act of July 9, 1798, ch. 70, \u00a7 8, 1 Stat. 580, 585. \nCongress levied the tax, but then allowed tax \ncommissioners to \u201crevise, adjust and vary, the \nvaluations of lands and dwelling-houses in any \nassessment district \u2026 [at] such a rate \u2026 as shall \nappear to be just and equitable: Provided, that the \nrelative valuations of the different lots or tracts of \nland, or dwelling-houses, in the same assessment \ndistrict, shall not be changed or affected.\u201d Id. \u00a7 22, \n1 Stat. at 589. In other words, Congress again \nenacted a delegation far broader than the one at \nissue here: \u201c[F]ederal administrators had the power \nto raise or lower the tax assessments of thousands of \nproperty owners all at once, by any percentage \namount, so long as the change \u2018shall appear to be just \nand equitable.\u2019\u201d Nicholas R.

Rev. 367 (2024). \n\n40 \n \nIII. The FCC Exercises Direction and Control \nOver the Administrator. \nThe Administrator\u2019s role providing ministerial \nsupport to the FCC in managing the Fund is likewise \nwell within the bounds of this Court\u2019s private \nnondelegation \nprecedents. \nThe \nFifth \nCircuit \nmajority\u2019s suggestion to the contrary is based on an \n\u201cexaggerated conception\u201d of the Administrator\u2019s \u201crole \nand discretion.\u201d Pet. App. 103a (Stewart, J., \ndissenting).  \nA. In determining whether a delegation to a \nprivate actor is permissible, this Court has focused \non whether \u201claw-making is \u2026 entrusted to\u201d a private \nactor and whether a private actor \u201cfunction[s] \nsubordinately to\u201d a government actor with the ability \nto exercise \u201cauthority and surveillance\u201d over it. \nSunshine Anthracite, 310 U.S. at 399. In this case, \nthose factors point decisively toward the lawfulness \nof the Commission\u2019s reliance on the Administrator. \nAdditionally, although the Fifth Circuit analyzed \nfactors that go beyond this Court\u2019s precedents, see \nPet. App. 46a-47a, those factors likewise support the \nlawfulness of the Administrator\u2019s ministerial role.  \nMost significantly, responsibility for carrying out \nCongress\u2019s direction in Section 254 is \u201cnot entrusted \nto\u201d the Administrator; rather, the Administrator \nremains subordinate to the FCC in all respects. \nSunshine Anthracite, 310 U.S. at 399; see Pet. \nApp. 46a (agency \u201cmust have final decision-making \nauthority\u201d). The FCC adopts the rules defining the \nscope of the various Fund programs, the eligible \nrecipients consistent with the statute, and the \namounts of the subsidies (including through rules \ngoverning competitive bidding to determine subsidy \namounts for particular recipients). Those rules \n\n41 \n \ninclude \u201celigibility requirements,\u201d \u201ccaps on particular \ntypes of support,\u201d and \u201cprecise formulas for \ncalculating the amount of the subsidy\u201d in particular \nprograms.\u201d FCC Pet. 20 (citing 47 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 54.410, \n54.507, 54.604-606).  \nMoreover, FCC rules explicitly prohibit the \nAdministrator from \u201cmak[ing] policy, interpret[ing] \nunclear provisions of the statute or rules or \ninterpret[ing] the intent of Congress.\u201d 47 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 54.702(c). Where the Administrator is in doubt, it \n\u201cshall seek guidance from the Commission.\u201d Id.  \nRegarding the quarterly contribution factor in \nparticular, the factor \u201cshall be determined by the \nCommission,\u201d \nnot \nthe \nAdministrator. \nId. \n\u00a7 54.709(a)(2) (emphasis added). The FCC rules and \ndecisions regarding the Fund programs provide the \nfoundation each quarter for determining both inputs \ninto the factor: the Fund programs\u2019 needs and the \nassessable contribution base.  \nThe Administrator, by contrast, plays only a \nministerial role. For example, on the demand side, \nthe Administrator prepares the \u201cquarterly projected \ncosts of the universal service support mechanisms\u201d \nand the \u201cprojected expenses for the federal universal \nservice support mechanisms for each quarter.\u201d Id. \n\u00a7 54.709(a)(2), (3). But those projections are no more \nthan calculations based on decisions already made by \nthe FCC, together with information provided by \nprivate parties under the FCC\u2019s rules. In this case, \nfor example, the Administrator determined the \nsupport amounts for the various Fund programs by \nwalking through the FCC rules and associated \ndecisions for each program. See, e.g., J.A. 21-33, 46-\n49. The FCC\u2019s caps and other funding limits further \nfactor into each program\u2019s demand calculation. See, \n\n42 \n \ne.g., id. at 46 (noting FCC \u201ccap for Funding Year \n2021\u201d in Rural Health Care program). \nOn top of that, the \u201c[t]otal projected expenses \u2026 \nfor \neach \nquarter \nmust \nbe \napproved \nby \nthe \nCommission before they are used to calculate the \nquarterly contribution factor,\u201d and the Commission \n\u201creserves the right to set projections of demand and \nadministrative \nexpenses \nat \namounts \nthat \n[it] \ndetermines will serve the public interest.\u201d 47 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 54.709(a)(3). \nLikewise, on the contribution-base side the \nAdministrator \n\u201ccompile[s]\u201d \nthe \n\u201ctotal \nsubject \nrevenues\u201d to which the contribution factor will apply \neach quarter, \u201cbased on information contained in the \nTelecommunications Reporting Worksheets,\u201d the \ncontent of which is in turn mandated by the \nCommission\u2019s own rules.

In this case, again, the \nAdministrator\u2019s filing shows that the contribution \nbase \u201cwas derived\u201d from information on \u201cForm 499-Q \nsubmissions\u201d the FCC requires). Pet. App. 158a.

Pet. App. 47a. In addition \nto the FCC\u2019s direct role in determining the \ncontribution \nfactor \nand \nreviewing \nthe \nAdministrator\u2019s projections, the FCC regularly \nexercises its authority to review the Administrator\u2019s \nministerial handling of claims for support. See 47 \n\n43 \n \nC.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 54.719 (parties may seek review), 54.723 \n(review of Administrator decisions is de novo). The \nCommission has not hesitated in exercising that \nauthority and issues a monthly document disposing \nof appeals of the Administrator\u2019s actions. In April \n2024, the FCC granted 27 of 53 E-Rate and Rural \nHealth Care appeals.

See, e.g., 47 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 54.702(g) (annual \nreport from Administrator to FCC and Congress), \n54.702(h) \n(quarterly \nreport \nto \nFCC \n\u201con \nthe \ndisbursement of \u2026 program funds\u201d), 54.702(j) (FCC \nhas \n\u201cfull \naccess \nto \nthe \ndata \ncollected\u201d \nin \nAdministrator\u2019s \nduties), \n54.709(b) \n(FCC \n\u201cmay \ninstruct the Administrator\u201d on how to handle \u201cexcess \ncontributions\u201d beyond steps already provided by \nrule). \n\n44 \n \nB. Contrary to the Fifth Circuit\u2019s understanding, \nthe FCC \u201cactually exercise[s]\u201d its authority each \nquarter to adopt the contribution factor. Pet. \nApp. 47a (emphasis omitted). The Fifth Circuit \nstated that \u201cUSAC\u2019s projections take legal effect \nwithout formal FCC approval,\u201d id. at 49a, but that is \ninconsistent with FCC rules and the actual process \nfor adopting the contribution factor. The FCC\u2019s Office \nof Managing Director\u2014not the Administrator\u2014\nissues the Public Notice announcing the proposed \ncontribution factor, and the absence of any further \naction within fourteen days of the release of that \nPublic Notice means the projections and resulting \ncontribution factor are \u201cdeemed approved by the \nCommission.\u201d 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.709(a)(3). It is thus the \nFCC\u2019s rules that govern approval and modifications.  \nThe Fifth Circuit also stated that the \u201c\u2018approval\u2019 \nprocess for [the Administrator\u2019s] proposals plays out \njust days before the new quarter begins,\u201d leaving the \nFCC \u201cno real choice but to accept [the] proposed \nfigures.\u201d Pet. App. 50a n.17. That, too, is inaccurate. \nThe Administrator must submit its quarterly \nprojections \nof \ndemand \n(including \nprogram \nadministrative expenses) and the \u201cbasis for those \nprojections\u201d to the FCC and its Office of Managing \nDirector \u201cat least sixty (60) calendar days\u201d before the \nstart of each quarter, and must submit the \u201ctotal \ncontribution base ... at least thirty (30) days before.\u201d \n47 \nC.F.R. \n\u00a7 54.709(a)(3). \nIn \naddition, \nthe \nCommission\u2019s Office of Managing Director \u201cshall \nreview\u201d both submissions and provide \u201cany necessary \nfeedback\u201d before either is \u201cpublicly filed with the \nFCC.\u201d FCC/USAC MOU \u00b6 13. And after the \nCommission\u2019s own Office of Managing Director \nreleases the proposed contribution factor, the \nCommission reserves time within which it can revise \n\n45 \n \nthe projected demand and administrative expenses \namounts where necessary to \u201cserve the public \ninterest.\u201d 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.709(a)(3). That the window \nfor this final step is 14 days does not support a \nconclusion that the Commission cannot or does not \nexercise its authority over the Administrator. \nThe Fifth Circuit also stated that the relative \ninfrequency \nwith \nwhich \nthe \nCommission \n\u201csubstantive[ly] \nchange[s]\u201d \nthe \nAdministrator\u2019s \nprojections means that it is a mere rubber stamp. \nPet. App. 50a (emphasis omitted). The legally \nrelevant question is whether the FCC has such \nauthority, not the frequency with which it exercises \nit. See Sunshine Anthracite, 310 U.S. at 399. \nRegardless, as discussed above, the Administrator\u2019s \nprojections are based on extensive FCC rules \ngoverning the various Universal Service Fund \nprograms. See supra pp.11-12. It is unsurprising that \nthe FCC, having established the policies and \ndetermined the amount of necessary revenues and \nthen tasked the Administrator with calculation and \nother \nministerial \ntasks \nto \nimplement \nthose \ndeterminations, does not frequently alter the output \nof that process. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s characterization \nof this system as an unsupervised \u201cblank check\u201d is \nthus incorrect. Pet. App. 53a.  \nIn any event, the government has identified \nmultiple occasions\u2014including before this litigation \nbegan\u2014on \nwhich \nit \nhas \ndeparted \nfrom \nthe \nAdministrator\u2019s \nprojections \nfor \nthe \nquarterly \ncontribution factor. See FCC Pet. 23; Proposed \nFourth Quarter 2023 Universal Service Contribution \nFactor, 38 FCC Rcd. 8362, 8362-63 (2023); Proposed \nThird Quarter 2023 Universal Service Contribution \nFactor, 38 FCC Rcd. 5670, 5670-71 (2023); Revised \n\n46 \n \nSecond Quarter 2003 Universal Service Contribution \nFactor, 18 FCC Rcd. 5097, 5097-98 (2003). The FCC \nhas also discussed its own revisions to the \nmethodology for calculating the contribution factor in \npublic notices for the proposed contribution factor. \nSee, e.g., Proposed First Quarter 2002 Universal \nService Contribution Factor, 16 FCC Rcd. 21334, \n21334 (2001) (FCC \u201creduce[d] the interval between \nthe accrual of revenues and the assessment of \nuniversal service contributions based on those \nrevenues\u201d from 12 months to 6 months). And at \nvarious times, the Commission has \u201cadjust[ed] the \ncontribution factor \u2026 if USAC collect[ed] insufficient \nfunds, or if USAC collect[ed] funds in excess of actual \nexpenses in the prior quarter.\u201d Universal Service \nContribution Methodology; A National Broadband \nPlan for Our Future, 27 FCC Rcd. 5357, \u00b6 351 (2012). \nIn \nmultiple \nways, \nthe \nFCC \nrevises \nthe \nAdministrator\u2019s projections or the contribution factor \nitself. \nThe Fifth Circuit also suggested that the \npossibility that \u201cdisbursements often do not comply \nwith FCC policy\u201d means that the FCC\u2019s role in \ndefining the rules and scope of Fund programs \u201cdoes \nnothing to limit the revenue FCC allows private \nentities to exact from consumers.\u201d Pet. App. 51a. \nThere is no basis in this Court\u2019s precedent for such a \nstandard\u2014an improper payment does not give rise to \na private nondelegation doctrine issue. See id. \nat 122a (Higginson, J., dissenting) (waste and fraud \nhave \u201cnever been enough to declare a coequal \nbranch\u2019s act unconstitutional\u201d). In any event, as \ndiscussed above, the FCC\u2019s rules for Fund programs \nprovide significant oversight into the relevant \naspects of how recipients spend Fund support. See, \ne.g., 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.622 (extensive rules regarding the \n\n47 \n \ncompetitive bidding process Rural Health Care \nprogram participants must undertake to request \nservices and select a provider); id. \u00a7\u00a7 54.801-806 \n(rules \nregarding \ncompetitive \nbidding, \ncoverage \nobligations, reporting requirements, and more for \nRural Digital Opportunity Fund in High Cost \nprogram). The Administrator\u2019s work also is subject to \nindependent audit (with the participation of the \nFCC\u2019s Office of Managing Director). See id. \u00a7 54.717. \nC. The Fifth Circuit also stated that Section 254 \n\u201cdoes not authorize\u201d the role the FCC has assigned to \nthe Administrator. Pet. App. 55a. It acknowledged, \nhowever, that the challengers did not bring a \nstatutory claim. Id. at 63a & n.21. It also recognized \nthat its concerns regarding statutory authorization \ndo not apply to delegations of \u201cministerial tasks.\u201d \nId. at 56a-58a. \nAs \ndiscussed \nabove, \nthe \nAdministrator\u2019s role is ministerial\u2014the FCC adopts \nthe contribution factor, and the Administrator\u2019s role \nis \nlimited \nto \nproviding \ninputs \ninto \nthat \ndetermination, \nsubject \nto \nFCC \napproval \nand \nnumerous forms of supervision. Whether Section 254 \nor other provisions of the Communications Act \nauthorize \nthe \nFCC \nto \nassign \ntasks \nto \nthe \nAdministrator is therefore immaterial to deciding the \nprivate nondelegation issue in this case.48 \nIV. The Court Should Reject the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \n\u201cCombination\u201d Approach. \nDespite its concerns regarding the public and \nprivate nondelegation issues, the Fifth Circuit \n \n48 In any event, in responding to such a statutory \nchallenge, the FCC may point to 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 154(i), \n201(b), and other provisions. \n\n48 \n \nconcluded that it \u201cneed not resolve either question in \nthis case\u201d because, in its view, \u201cthe combination of \nCongress\u2019s sweeping delegation to FCC and FCC\u2019s \nunauthorized subdelegation to USAC violates the \nLegislative Vesting Clause in Article I, \u00a7 1.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 64a.  \nA. As discussed above, the majority\u2019s reasons for \nbeing \u201chighly skeptical,\u201d Pet. App. 64a, of Congress\u2019s \ndelegation to the FCC are without merit. Rather, as \nthe principal dissent concluded, the text and context \nof Section 254 establish \u201ca clear intelligible principle \ndelimiting agency discretion.\u201d Id. at 97a. Likewise, \nthe court of appeals\u2019 reasons for being \u201cskeptical\u201d of \nthe FCC\u2019s use of the Administrator in a subordinate \ncapacity do not survive scrutiny. Rather, as Judge \nStewart put it in dissent, the majority adopted an \n\u201cexaggerated \nconception \nof \nUSAC\u2019s \nrole \nand \ndiscretion to create a private nondelegation doctrine \nproblem where none exists.\u201d Id. at 103a. The \ncombination of these two non-violations is not \nproblematic.  \nB. In addition, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s approach is \ninconsistent \nwith \nhow \nthis \nCourt \naddressed \nchallenges in Sunshine Anthracite, Currin, and other \ncases. \nSunshine Anthracite\u2014like this case\u2014involved \nboth public and private nondelegation claims. Yet, \nthis Court addressed those issues individually, \nrather than assessing the \u201ccombination\u201d of the two \nissues as the Fifth Circuit would. The Court first \nconcluded that Congress\u2019s authorization for the \nNational Bituminous Coal Commission to \u201cfix \nminimum prices\u201d and \u201cestablish maximum prices\u201d for \nmembers of the \u201cBituminous Coal Code\u201d was \npermissible, holding that \u201cin the hands of experts the \n\n49 \n \ncriteria which Congress has supplied are wholly \nadequate.\u201d 310 U.S. at 388-89, 397-98. Separately, \nthe Court concluded that \u201claw-making is not \nentrusted to the industry.\u201d Id. at 399. Were the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s approach correct, the Court would have \ngone \non \nto \nconsider \nwhether, \nwhile \n\u201cnot \nindependently unconstitutional,\u201d the alleged public \nand private nondelegation problems nonetheless \n\u201ccombine[d] to violate the Constitution\u2019s separation \nof powers.\u201d Pet. App. 64a.  \nCurrin likewise considered both public and \nprivate nondelegation issues. Congress authorized \nthe Secretary of Agriculture to designate markets \nwhere standards for tobacco would apply, subject to \nthe condition that growers in that market vote in \nfavor. See 306 U.S. at 6. The Court separately \nconsidered whether that scheme \u201cinvolve[d] any \ndelegation of legislative authority\u201d to the \u201cgrowers of \ntobacco,\u201d and concluded it did not. Id. at 15. The \nCourt \nthen \nconcluded \nthere \nwas \nalso \nno \n\u201cunconstitutional delegation to the Secretary of \nAgriculture.\u201d Id. at 16. The Court did not consider \nwhether the combination of those features separately \nviolated the separation of powers. \nThe \nFifth \nCircuit\u2019s \nattempt \nto \ndistinguish \nSunshine Anthracite and Currin because \u201cthe Court \nfound the Government had not delegated any \nlegislative power to any private entity\u201d fails. Pet. \nApp. 78a-79a. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s \u201ccombination\u201d \napproach was necessary in this case because that \ncourt did not hold that Section 254 or the FCC\u2019s \nadministration of the Fund violates either the public \nor \nprivate \nnondelegation \ndoctrine. \nSunshine \nAnthracite and Currin similarly rejected both public \nand private nondelegation challenges. The Fifth \n\n50 \n \nCircuit\u2019s approach thus would have called for an \nanalysis \nwhether \nthe \n\u201cnot \nindependently \nunconstitutional\u201d \nparts, \nid. \nat \n64a, \nwere \nan \nunconstitutional whole.  \nBeyond the specific context of public and private \nnondelegation challenges, this Court has often \nconsidered multiple separation-of-powers challenges \n(and other constitutional challenges) in the same \ncase. As in Sunshine Anthracite, the Court did not \nanalyze whether a \u201ccombination\u201d of non-violations \ntogether amounted to a constitutional violation. \nIn Mistretta, for example, prisoners challenging \nthe \nconstitutionality \nof \nthe \nU.S. \nSentencing \nCommission raised several \u201cseparation of powers\u201d \nconcerns, in addition to arguing that \u201cCongress [had] \ndelegated excessive authority to the Commission to \nstructure the [Sentencing] Guidelines.\u201d 488 U.S. at \n370. This Court first addressed and rejected the \nnondelegation \ndoctrine \nchallenge, \neven \nwhile \nagreeing that the Sentencing Commission \u201cenjoys \nsignificant discretion in formulating guidelines.\u201d Id. \nat 377. \u201cHaving determined\u201d that the nondelegation \nchallenge failed, the Court \u201cturn[ed] to\u201d the multiple \ndistinct separation-of-powers challenges regarding \nthe \n\u201c[l]ocation\u201d \nand \n\u201c[c]omposition\u201d \nof \nthe \nCommission and the President\u2019s ability to \u201cremove\u201d \nits members. Id. at 380, 384, 397, 409. Contrary to \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s approach here, the Court \naddressed the nondelegation doctrine issues and \neach of the purported separation-of-powers violations \nseparately, \nwithout \nconsidering \nwhether \nthe \ncombination of these independently constitutional \n\n51 \n \nfacets might together violate the Constitution. See, \ne.g., id. at 381-411.49 \nC. Neither Seila Law nor Free Enterprise Fund \nrequires that courts assess the \u201ccombination\u201d of \nmultiple, individually constitutional, aspects of any \nchallenged statutory or regulatory scheme. Both \ncases addressed a particular separation-of-powers \nquestion not at issue here: what restrictions on the \nPresident\u2019s \nauthority \nto \nremove \nofficers \nare \npermissible, \nconsistent \nwith \nthe \nConstitution\u2019s \nvesting of the \u201cexecutive Power\u201d in the President. See \nSeila Law, 591 U.S. at 227 (quoting Free Enter. \nFund, 561 U.S. at 483).  \nThe removal question at issue in Seila Law was \nwhether the single head of an \u201cagency that wields \nsignificant executive power\u201d could constitutionally \nenjoy protection from at-will removal by the \nPresident. 591 U.S. at 204. While Humphrey\u2019s \nExecutor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602 (1935), had \napproved removal protections for \u201cmultimember \n \n49 See also, e.g., Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 660 \n(1988) (considering whether provisions governing the \nfunction \nof \nan \nindependent \ncounsel \nviolated \nthe \nAppointments Clause of Article II or the \u201climitations of \nArticle III\u201d or otherwise \u201cimpermissibly interfere[d] with \nthe President\u2019s authority under Article II in violation of \nthe constitutional separation of powers); Yakus, 321 U.S. \nat \n418 \n(considering \nmultiple \nconstitutional \nissues \nalongside \na \npublic \nnondelegation \nchallenge); \nJ.W. \nHampton, Jr., 276 U.S. at 404-07, 411-13  (considering \nchallenges to both (1) Congress\u2019s grant of authority to the \nPresident to impose customs duties on certain goods and \n(2) whether such customs duties could be imposed for a \npurpose other than raising revenue).  \n\n52 \n \nexpert agencies that do not wield substantial \nexecutive power\u201d and Morrison had approved \nremoval protection for \u201cinferior officers with limited \nduties,\u201d the head of the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau fit neither description, and the \nCourt was unwilling to \u201cextend those precedents to \nth[is] \u2018new situation.\u2019\u201d 591 U.S. at 216-20. Thus, as \nJudge Higginson explained in dissent, the Court \nsimply \u201capplied precedent\u201d and \u201cdeclined to create a \nnew\u201d \nexception \nto \nthe \nPresident\u2019s \n\u201cotherwise \n\u2018unrestricted removal power.\u2019\u201d Pet. App. 117a \n(quoting Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 204).  \nNor did Free Enterprise Fund establish an \napproach \nthat \nsupports \nthe \nFifth \nCircuit\u2019s \ncombination theory. In that removal case, the \nstatutory scheme provided that members of the \nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board were \n\u201csubstantially insulated from the [Securities and \nExchange] \nCommission\u2019s \ncontrol,\u201d \nand \nSEC \ncommissioners were also understood to be protected \nfrom at-will removal. 561 U.S. at 486-87. For that \nreason, the Court was required to \u201cconsider a new \nsituation not yet encountered\u201d in its line of \nprecedents on removal authority\u2014\u201cwhether these \nseparate layers of protection may be combined.\u201d Id. \nat 483. \nBecause \nthe \n\u201cadded \nlayer \nof \ntenure \nprotection\u201d meant that the \u201cPresident is stripped of \nthe power [the Court\u2019s] precedents have preserved,\u201d \nthe Court struck it down. Id. at 495-96; see also id. at \n514 (\u201cWhile we have sustained in certain cases limits \non the President\u2019s removal power, the Act before us \nimposes a new type of restriction \u2026 .\u201d). \nContrary to the Fifth Circuit\u2019s reading, however, \nFree Enterprise Fund did not purport to announce a \n\u201cgeneral principle\u201d extending beyond a challenge to \n\n53 \n \nmultiple layers of removal protection. Pet. App. 66a. \nIndeed, Free Enterprise Fund itself also involved \nseveral additional challenges to the Board \u201cunder the \nAppointments Clause,\u201d 561 U.S. at 510, each of \nwhich \nthe \nCourt \nconsidered \nand \nrejected \nindependently, without considering whether their \ncombination \nmight \nnonetheless \nviolate \nthe \nConstitution.  \nMoreover, \nremoval \nissues \nare \nsignificantly \ndifferent from nondelegation issues. As this Court \nexplained, on account of the \u201csecond level of tenure \nprotection\u201d at issue in Free Enterprise Fund, \n\u201c[n]either \nthe \nPresident, \nnor \nanyone \ndirectly \nresponsible to him, nor even an officer whose conduct \nhe may review only for good cause, ha[d] full control \nover the Board.\u201d 561 U.S. at 496. Thus, even if both \nlevels of tenure protection were acceptable by \nthemselves, as was the case in Free Enterprise Fund, \nthey combined to create a structure that necessarily \nlimited the President\u2019s authority beyond permissible \nbounds.  \nIn \ncontrast, \nthere \nis \nnothing \ninherently \nproblematic about Congress delegating to an agency \nand the agency separately relying on another entity \nfor \nsome \nfunctions, \nsubject \nto \nthe \nagency\u2019s \nsupervision. Even assuming arguendo that the FCC \nis not adequately supervising the Administrator, the \nFCC retains full authority to do so.  Accordingly, this \nis not a case where \u201ceven\u201d officials \u201cwhose conduct \n[the President] may review only for good cause\u201d lack \ncontrol over the Administrator. Id. And if a court \nwere to determine that some agency lacked full \ncontrol over the entity to which it delegated \nauthority, the appropriate remedy would be to \ncorrect the impermissible delegation. \n\n54 \n \nFinally, the harm in removal cases is cumulative, \nwhile the harm in public and private nondelegation \ncases is not. That is, each layer of tenure protection \nlimits \nthe \nPresident\u2019s \nability \nto \ncontrol \nhis \nsubordinates\u2014each layer\u2019s harm is the same, with \ncumulative effect. In contrast, the harms in public \nnondelegation cases (Congress\u2019s improper delegation \nof its legislative powers) and the harm in private \nnondelegation \ncases \n(an \nagency\u2019s \nimproper \ndelegation of government power to private actors) \nare distinct and non-cumulative. Therefore, for \nexample, a grant of authority by Congress that \nsatisfies the public nondelegation doctrine is not \naffected by an agency\u2019s impermissible delegation of \nnon-ministerial duties to a private party.  \nD. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s approach also would create \nserious workability problems, which in turn would \nlead to confusion in the lower courts. Most notably, \nthe Fifth Circuit \u201coffers no test\u201d for adjudicating \nsituations \ninvolving \nauthorization \nfor \nboth \ngovernment agencies and private parties providing \nministerial support, Pet. App. 123a (Higginson, J., \ndissenting), let alone other separation-of-powers \ncontexts. Neither Free Enterprise Fund nor Seila \nLaw offered one, as neither case spoke so broadly as \nthe Fifth Circuit concluded they did.  \nIndeed, \nthis \nCourt \nhas \nraised \nworkability \nconcerns regarding such an interpretation of Seila \nLaw, \nrejecting \nthe \nargument \nthat \n\u201cthe \nconstitutionality of removal restrictions hinges on\u201d \nthe \u201crelative importance of the regulatory and \nenforcement authority of disparate agencies.\u201d Collins \nv. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220, 253 (2021). \u201cCourts are not \nwell-suited to weigh\u201d such matters. Id. Yet, the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s approach would require courts to go far \n\n55 \n \nbeyond \nsuch \nissues, \nweighing \nthe \n\u201crelative \nimportance\u201d of various constitutional aspects of \nvarious \nstatutory \nor \nregulatory \nschemes \nfor \ndetermining whether their combination exceeds a \nthus-far undefined limit.  \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the Fifth Circuit should be \nreversed.  \n \n \nAndrew Jay Schwartzman \n525 9th Street NW, 7th Fl. \nWashington, DC 20004 \n(202) 241-2408 \nAndySchwartzman \n@gmail.com \n \nCounsel for Benton \nInstitute, NDIA, and \nMediaJustice \n \n \n \nJANUARY 9, 2025 \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nChristopher J.

Upon \nrequest and consistent with the public interest, con-\nvenience and necessity, the Commission may, with re-\nspect to an area served by a rural telephone company, \nand shall, in the case of all other areas, designate \nmore than one common carrier as an eligible telecom-\nmunications carrier for a service area designated un-\nder this paragraph, so long as each additional request-\ning carrier meets the requirements of paragraph (1). \nBefore designating an additional eligible telecommu-\nnications carrier for an area served by a rural tele-\nphone company, the Commission shall find that the \ndesignation is in the public interest. \n \n \n\n11a \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 252 provides, in relevant part: \nProcedures for negotiation, arbitration, and \napproval of agreements \n[\u2026] \n(d) Pricing standards \n(1) Interconnection and network element \ncharges \nDeterminations by a State commission of the \njust and reasonable rate for the interconnection of \nfacilities and equipment for purposes of subsection \n(c)(2) of section 251 of this title, and the just and \nreasonable rate for network elements for purposes \nof subsection (c)(3) of such section\u2014 \n(A) shall be\u2014 \n(i) based on the cost (determined with-\nout reference to a rate-of-return or other \nrate-based proceeding) of providing the in-\nterconnection or network element (which-\never is applicable), and \n(ii) nondiscriminatory, and \n(B) may include a reasonable profit. \n \n \n\n12a \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254 provides: \nUniversal service \n(a) Procedures to review universal service re-\nquirements \n(1) Federal-State Joint Board on universal \nservice \nWithin one month after February 8, 1996, the \nCommission shall institute and refer to a Federal-\nState Joint Board under section 410(c) of this title a \nproceeding to recommend changes to any of its regu-\nlations in order to implement sections 214(e) of this \ntitle and this section, including the definition of the \nservices that are supported by Federal universal ser \nvice support mechanisms and a specific timetable for \ncompletion of such recommendations. In addition to \nthe members of the Joint Board required under sec-\ntion 410(c) of this title, one member of such Joint \nBoard shall be a State-appointed utility consumer ad-\nvocate nominated by a national organization of State \nutility consumer advocates. The Joint Board shall, af-\nter notice and opportunity for public comment, make \nits recommendations to the Commission 9 months af-\nter February 8, 1996. \n(2) Commission action \nThe Commission shall initiate a single proceeding \nto implement the recommendations from the Joint \nBoard required by paragraph (1) and shall complete \nsuch proceeding within 15 months after February 8, \n1996. The rules established by such proceeding shall \ninclude a definition of the services that are supported \nby Federal universal service support mechanisms and \na specific timetable for implementation. Thereafter, \nthe Commission shall complete any proceeding to \n\n13a \nimplement subsequent recommendations from any \nJoint Board on universal service within one year after \nreceiving such recommendations. \n(b) Universal service principles \nThe Joint Board and the Commission shall base \npolicies for the preservation and advancement of uni-\nversal service on the following principles: \n(1) Quality and rates \nQuality services should be available at just, rea-\nsonable, and affordable rates. \n(2) Access to advanced services \nAccess to advanced telecommunications and infor-\nmation services should be provided in all regions of \nthe Nation. \n(3) Access in rural and high cost areas \nConsumers in all regions of the Nation, including \nlow-income consumers and those in rural, insular, and \nhigh cost areas, should have access to telecommunica-\ntions and information services, including interex-\nchange services and advanced telecommunications \nand information services, that are reasonably compa-\nrable to those services provided in urban areas and \nthat are available at rates that are reasonably compa-\nrable to rates charged for similar services in urban ar-\neas. \n(4) Equitable and nondiscriminatory con-\ntributions \nAll providers of telecommunications services \nshould make an equitable and nondiscriminatory con-\ntribution to the preservation and advancement of uni-\nversal service. \n\n14a \n(5) Specific and predictable support mech-\nanisms \nThere should be specific, predictable and sufficient \nFederal and State mechanisms to preserve and ad-\nvance universal service. \n(6) Access to advanced telecommunications \nservices for schools, health care, and li-\nbraries \nElementary and secondary schools and class-\nrooms, health care providers, and libraries should \nhave access to advanced telecommunications services \nas described in subsection (h). \n(7) Additional principles \nSuch other principles as the Joint Board and the \nCommission determine are necessary and appropriate \nfor the protection of the public interest, convenience, \nand necessity and are consistent with this chapter. \n(c) Definition \n(1) In general \nUniversal service is an evolving level of telecom-\nmunications services that the Commission shall es-\ntablish periodically under this section, taking into ac-\ncount advances in telecommunications and infor-\nmation technologies and services. The Joint Board in \nrecommending, and the Commission in establishing, \nthe definition of the services that are supported by \nFederal universal service support mechanisms shall \nconsider the extent to which such telecommunications \nservices\u2014 \n(A) are essential to education, public health, \nor public safety; \n(B) have, through the operation of market \n\n15a \nchoices by customers, been subscribed to by a sub-\nstantial majority of residential customers; \n(C) are being deployed in public telecommuni-\ncations networks by telecommunications carriers; \nand \n(D) are consistent with the public interest, \nconvenience, and necessity. \n(2) Alterations and modifications \nThe Joint Board may, from time to time, recom-\nmend to the Commission modifications in the defini-\ntion of the services that are supported by Federal uni-\nversal service support mechanisms. \n(3) Special services \nIn addition to the services included in the defini-\ntion of universal service under paragraph (1), the \nCommission may designate additional services for \nsuch support mechanisms for schools, libraries, and \nhealth care providers for the purposes of subsection \n(h). \n(d) Telecommunications carrier contribution \nEvery telecommunications carrier that provides \ninterstate telecommunications services shall contrib-\nute, on an equitable and nondiscriminatory basis, to \nthe specific, predictable, and sufficient mechanisms \nestablished by the Commission to preserve and ad-\nvance universal service. The Commission may exempt \na carrier or class of carriers from this requirement if \nthe carrier\u2019s telecommunications activities are limited \nto such an extent that the level of such carrier\u2019s con-\ntribution to the preservation and advancement of uni-\nversal service would be de minimis. Any other pro-\nvider of interstate telecommunications may be re-\nquired to contribute to the preservation and \n\n16a \nadvancement of universal service if the public interest \nso requires. \n(e) Universal service support \nAfter the date on which Commission regulations \nimplementing this section take effect, only an eligible \ntelecommunications carrier designated under section \n214(e) of this title shall be eligible to receive specific \nFederal universal service support. A carrier that re-\nceives such support shall use that support only for the \nprovision, maintenance, and upgrading of facilities \nand services for which the support is intended. Any \nsuch support should be explicit and sufficient to \nachieve the purposes of this section. \n(f) \nState authority \nA State may adopt regulations not inconsistent \nwith the Commission\u2019s rules to preserve and advance \nuniversal service. Every telecommunications carrier \nthat provides intrastate telecommunications services \nshall contribute, on an equitable and nondiscrimina-\ntory basis, in a manner determined by the State to the \npreservation and advancement of universal service in \nthat State. A State may adopt regulations to provide \nfor additional definitions and standards to preserve \nand advance universal service within that State only \nto the extent that such regulations adopt additional \nspecific, predictable, and sufficient mechanisms to \nsupport such definitions or standards that do not rely \non or burden Federal universal service support mech-\nanisms. \n(g) Interexchange and interstate services \nWithin 6 months after February 8, 1996, the Com-\nmission shall adopt rules to require that the rates \ncharged by providers of interexchange telecommuni-\ncations services to subscribers in rural and high cost \n\n17a \nareas shall be no higher than the rates charged by \neach such provider to its subscribers in urban areas. \nSuch rules shall also require that a provider of inter-\nstate interexchange telecommunications services \nshall provide such services to its subscribers in each \nState at rates no higher than the rates charged to its \nsubscribers in any other State. \n(h) Telecommunications services for certain \nproviders \n(1) In general \n(A) Health care providers for rural areas \nA telecommunications carrier shall, upon receiv-\ning a bona fide request, provide telecommunications \nservices which are necessary for the provision of \nhealth care services in a State, including instruction \nrelating to such services, to any public or nonprofit \nhealth care provider that serves persons who reside in \nrural areas in that State at rates that are reasonably \ncomparable to rates charged for similar services in ur-\nban areas in that State.

If the subscriber\u2019s eligibility was previously \nconfirmed through an eligibility database during \nenrollment or a prior recertification and the sub-\nscriber is no longer included in any eligibility da-\ntabase, the eligible telecommunications carrier \nmust obtain both an Annual Recertification Form \nand documentation meeting the requirements of \nparagraph (b)(1)(i)(B) or (c)(1)(i)(B) from that sub-\nscriber to complete the process. Eligible telecom-\nmunications carriers must use the Wireline Com-\npetition Bureau-approved universal Annual Recer-\ntification Form, except where state law, state reg-\nulation, a state Lifeline administrator, or a state \nagency requires eligible telecommunications carri-\ners to use state-specific Lifeline recertification \nforms. \n \n(iv) In states in which the National Verifier has \nbeen implemented, the eligible telecommunica-\ntions carrier cannot re-certify subscribers not \nfound in the National Verifier by obtaining a certi-\nfication form from the subscriber. \n \n(3) Where the National Verifier, state Lifeline ad-\nministrator, or other state agency is responsible for re-\ncertification of a subscriber\u2019s Lifeline eligibility, the \nNational Verifier, state Lifeline administrator, or \nstate agency must confirm a subscriber\u2019s current eli-\ngibility to receive a Lifeline service by: \n \n(i) Querying the appropriate eligibility data-\nbases, confirming that the subscriber still meets \nthe program-based eligibility requirements for \n\n57a \nLifeline, and documenting the results of that re-\nview; or \n \n(ii) Querying the appropriate income data-\nbases, confirming that the subscriber continues to \nmeet the income-based eligibility requirements for \nLifeline, and documenting the results of that re-\nview. \n \n(iii) If the subscriber\u2019s program-based or in-\ncome-based eligibility for Lifeline cannot be deter-\nmined by accessing one or more eligibility data-\nbases, then the National Verifier, state Lifeline ad-\nministrator, or state agency must obtain a signed \ncertification from the subscriber confirming the \nsubscriber\u2019s continued eligibility. If the sub-\nscriber\u2019s eligibility was previously confirmed \nthrough an eligibility database during enrollment \nor a prior recertification and the subscriber is no \nlonger included in any eligibility database, the Na-\ntional Verifier, state Lifeline administrator, or \nstate agency must obtain both an approved Annual \nRecertification Form and documentation meeting \nthe requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i)(B) or \n(c)(1)(i)(B) from that subscriber to complete the \ncertification process. Entities responsible for re-\ncertification under this section must use the Wire-\nline Competition Bureau-approved universal An-\nnual Recertification Form, except where state law, \nstate regulation, a state Lifeline administrator, or \na state agency requires eligible telecommunica-\ntions carriers to use state-specific Lifeline recerti-\nfication forms, or where the National Verifier \nRecertification Form is required. \n \n(4) Where the National Verifier, state Lifeline ad-\nministrator, or other state agency is responsible for re-\ncertification of subscribers\u2019 Lifeline eligibility, the \n\n58a \nNational Verifier, state Lifeline administrator, or \nother state agency must provide to each eligible tele-\ncommunications carrier the results of its annual re-\ncertification efforts with respect to that eligible tele-\ncommunications carrier\u2019s subscribers. \n \n(5) If an eligible telecommunications carrier is un-\nable to re-certify a subscriber or has been notified by \nthe National Verifier, a state Lifeline administrator, \nor other state agency that it is unable to re-certify a \nsubscriber, the eligible telecommunications carrier \nmust comply with the de-enrollment requirements \nprovided for in \u00a7 54.405(e)(4). \n(g) One-Per-Household Worksheet. If the prospec-\ntive subscriber shares an address with one or more ex-\nisting Lifeline subscribers according to the National \nLifeline Accountability Database or National Verifier, \nthe prospective subscriber must complete a form cer-\ntifying compliance with the one-per-household rule \nupon initial enrollment. Eligible telecommunications \ncarriers must fulfill the requirement in this para-\ngraph (g) by using the Household Worksheet, as pro-\nvided by the Wireline Competition Bureau. Where \nstate law, state regulation, a state Lifeline adminis-\ntrator, or a state agency requires eligible telecommu-\nnications carriers to use state-specific Lifeline enroll-\nment forms, eligible telecommunications carriers may \nuse those forms in place of the Commission\u2019s House-\nhold Worksheet. At re-certification, if there are \nchanges to the subscriber\u2019s household that would pre-\nvent the subscriber from accurately certifying to par-\nagraph (d)(3)(vi) of this section, then the subscriber \nmust complete a new Household Worksheet. Eligible \ntelecommunications carriers must mark subscribers \nas having completed a Household Worksheet in the \nNational Lifeline Accountability Database if and only \n\n59a \nif the subscriber shares an address with an existing \nLifeline subscriber, as reported by the National Life-\nline Accountability Database. \n(h) National Verifier transition.

All survivors \nseeking to receive emergency communications sup-\nport from the Lifeline program must have their eligi-\nbility to participate in the program confirmed through \nthe National Verifier. The National Verifier will also \ntransition survivors approaching the end of their six-\nmonth emergency support period in a manner con-\nsistent with the requirements applied to eligible tele-\ncommunications carriers at paragraph (f) of this sec-\ntion, and the National Verifier will de-enroll survivors \nwhose continued eligibility to participate in the Life-\nline program cannot be confirmed, consistent with \n\u00a7 54.405(e)(6). \n \n\n60a \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.500 provides, in relevant part: \nTerms and definitions. \n[\u2026] \nLowest corresponding price. \u201cLowest corresponding \nprice\u201d is the lowest price that a service provider \ncharges to non-residential customers who are simi-\nlarly situated to a particular school, library, or library \nconsortium for similar services. \n \n \n\n61a \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.507 provides: \nCap. \n(a) Amount of the annual cap. The aggregate an-\nnual cap on federal universal service support for \nschools and libraries shall be $3.9 billion per funding \nyear, of which $1 billion per funding year will be avail-\nable for category two services, as described in \n\u00a7 54.502(a)(2), unless demand for category one ser-\nvices is higher than available funding. \n \n(1) Inflation increase. In funding year 2016 and \nsubsequent funding years, the $3.9 billion funding cap \non federal universal service support for schools and li-\nbraries shall be automatically increased annually to \ntake into account increases in the rate of inflation as \ncalculated in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. \n \n(2) Increase calculation. To measure increases \nin the rate of inflation for the purposes of this para-\ngraph (a), the Commission shall use the Gross Domes-\ntic Product Chain-type Price Index (GDP-CPI). To \ncompute the annual increase as required by this par-\nagraph (a), the percentage increase in the GDP-CPI \nfrom the previous year will be used. For instance, the \nannual increase in the GDP-CPI from 2008 to 2009 \nwould be used for the 2010 funding year. The increase \nshall be rounded to the nearest 0.1 percent by round-\ning 0.05 percent and above to the next higher 0.1 per-\ncent and otherwise rounding to the next lower 0.1 per-\ncent. This percentage increase shall be added to the \namount of the annual funding cap from the previous \nfunding year. If the yearly average GDP-CPI de-\ncreases or stays the same, the annual funding cap \nshall remain the same as the previous year. \n\n62a \n \n(3) Public notice. When the calculation of the \nyearly average GDP-CPI is determined, the Wireline \nCompetition Bureau shall publish a public notice in \nthe FEDERAL REGISTER within 60 days announcing \nany increase of the annual funding cap including any \nincrease to the $1 billion funding level available for \ncategory two services based on the rate of inflation. \n \n(4) Filing window requests. At the close of the \nfiling window, if requests for category one services are \ngreater than the available funding, the Administrator \nshall shift category two funds to provide support for \ncategory one services. If available funds are sufficient \nto meet demand for category one services, the Admin-\nistrator, at the direction of the Wireline Competition \nBureau, shall direct the remaining additional funds to \nprovide support for category two requests. \n \n(5) Amount of unused funds. All funds collected \nthat are unused shall be carried forward into subse-\nquent funding years for use in the schools and librar-\nies support mechanism in accordance with the public \ninterest and notwithstanding the annual cap. The \nChief, Wireline Competition Bureau, is delegated au-\nthority to determine the proportion of unused funds, \nif any, needed to meet category one demand, and to \ndirect the Administrator to use any remaining funds \nto provide support for category two requests. The Ad-\nministrator shall report to the Commission, on a quar-\nterly basis, funding that is unused from prior years of \nthe schools and libraries support mechanism. \n \n(6) Application of unused funds. On an annual \nbasis, in the second quarter of each calendar year, all \nfunds that are collected and that are unused from \nprior years shall be available for use in the next full \nfunding year of the schools and libraries mechanism \nin \naccordance \nwith \nthe \npublic \ninterest \nand \n\n63a \nnotwithstanding the annual cap as described in this \nparagraph (a). \n(b) Funding year. A funding year for purposes of the \nschools and libraries cap shall be the period July 1 \nthrough June 30. \n(c) Requests. The Administrator shall implement an \ninitial filing period that treats all schools and libraries \nfiling an application within that period as if their ap-\nplications were simultaneously received. The initial \nfiling period shall begin and conclude on dates to be \ndetermined by the Administrator with the approval of \nthe Chief of the Wireline Competition Bureau. The \nAdministrator shall maintain on the Administrator\u2019s \nWeb site a running tally of the funds already commit-\nted for the existing funding year. The Administrator \nmay implement such additional filing periods as it \ndeems necessary. \n(d) Annual filing requirement. \n \n(1) Schools and libraries, and consortia of such eli-\ngible entities shall file new funding requests for each \nfunding year no sooner than the July 1 prior to the \nstart of that funding year. Schools, libraries, and eli-\ngible consortia must use recurring services for which \ndiscounts have been committed by the Administrator \nwithin the funding year for which the discounts were \nsought. \n \n(2) Installation of category one non-recurring ser-\nvices may begin on January 1 prior to the July 1 start \nof the funding year, provided the following conditions \nare met: \n \n(i) Construction begins after selection of the \nservice provider pursuant to a posted FCC Form \n470, \n\n64a \n \n(ii) A category one recurring service must de-\npend on the installation of the infrastructure, and \n \n(iii) The actual service start date for that recur-\nring service is on or after the start of the funding \nyear (July 1). \n(3) Installation of category two non-recurring ser-\nvices may begin on April 1 prior to the July 1 start of \nthe funding year. \n(4) The deadline for implementation of all non-re-\ncurring services will be September 30 following the \nclose of the funding year. An applicant may request \nand receive from the Administrator an extension of \nthe implementation deadline for non-recurring ser-\nvices if it satisfies one of the following criteria: \n(i) The applicant\u2019s funding commitment deci-\nsion letter is issued by the Administrator on or af-\nter March 1 of the funding year for which discounts \nare authorized; \n(ii) The applicant receives a service provider \nchange authorization or service substitution au-\nthorization from the Administrator on or after \nMarch 1 of the funding year for which discounts \nare authorized; \n(iii) The applicant\u2019s service provider is unable \nto complete implementation for reasons beyond the \nservice provider\u2019s control; or \n(iv) The applicant\u2019s service provider is unwill-\ning to complete installation because funding dis-\nbursements are delayed while the Administrator \ninvestigates the application for program compli-\nance. \n(e) Long term contracts. If schools and libraries en-\nter into long term contracts for eligible services, the \n\n65a \nAdministrator shall only commit funds to cover the \npro rata portion of such a long term contract sched-\nuled to be delivered during the funding year for which \nuniversal service support is sought. \n(f) Rules of distribution. When the filing period de-\nscribed in paragraph (c) of this section closes, the Ad-\nministrator shall calculate the total demand for both \ncategory one and category two support submitted by \napplicants during the filing period. If total demand for \nthe funding year exceeds the total support available \nfor category one or both categories, the Administrator \nshall take the following steps: \n \n(1) Category one. The Administrator shall first \ncalculate the demand for category one services for all \ndiscount levels. The Administrator shall allocate the \ncategory one funds to these requests for support, be-\nginning with the most economically disadvantaged \nschools and libraries, as determined by the schools \nand libraries discount matrix in \u00a7 54.505(c). Schools \nand libraries eligible for a 90 percent discount shall \nreceive first priority for the category one funds. The \nAdministrator shall next allocate funds toward the re-\nquests submitted by schools and libraries eligible for \nan 80 percent discount, then for a 70 percent discount, \nand shall continue committing funds for category one \nservices in the same manner to the applicants at each \ndescending discount level until there are no funds re-\nmaining. \n \n(2) Category two. The Administrator shall next \ncalculate the demand for category two services for all \ndiscount categories as determined by the schools and \nlibraries discount matrix in \u00a7 54.505(c). If that de-\nmand exceeds the category two budget for that fund-\ning year, the Administrator shall allocate the category \ntwo funds beginning with the most economically \n\n66a \ndisadvantaged schools and libraries, as determined by \nthe schools and libraries discount matrix in \n\u00a7 54.505(c). The Administrator shall allocate funds to-\nward the category two requests submitted by schools \nand libraries eligible for an 85 percent discount first, \nthen for a 80 percent discount, and shall continue \ncommitting funds in the same manner to the appli-\ncants at each descending discount level until there are \nno category two funds remaining. \n \n(3) To the extent that there are single discount per-\ncentage levels associated with \u201cshared services\u201d under \n\u00a7 54.505(b)(4), the Administrator shall allocate funds \nto the applicants at each descending discount level \n(e.g., 90 percent, 89 percent, then 88 percent) until \nthere are no funds remaining. \n \n(4) In the event that demand exceeds available \nfunding, requests for category one services used off-\npremises shall be funded after on-premises category \none and category two services. \n \n(5) For paragraphs (f)(1) through (4) of this section, \nif the remaining funds are not sufficient to support all \nof the funding requests within a particular discount \nlevel, the Administrator shall allocate funds at that \ndiscount level using the percentage of students eligi-\nble for the National School Lunch Program. Thus, if \nthere is not enough support to fund all requests at the \n40 percent discount level, the Administrator shall al-\nlocate funds beginning with those applicants with the \nhighest percentage of NSLP eligibility for that dis-\ncount level by funding those applicants with 19 per-\ncent NSLP eligibility, then 18 percent NSLP eligibil-\nity, and shall continue committing funds in the same \nmanner to applicants at each descending percentage \nof NSLP until there are no funds remaining. \n \n\n67a \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.511 provides: \nOrdering services. \n(a) Selecting a provider of eligible services. Ex-\ncept as exempted in \u00a7 54.503(e), in selecting a provider \nof eligible services, schools, libraries, library consor-\ntia, and consortia including any of those entities shall \ncarefully consider all bids submitted and must select \nthe most cost-effective service offering. In determin-\ning which service offering is the most cost-effective, \nentities may consider relevant factors other than the \npre-discount prices submitted by providers, but price \nshould be the primary factor considered. \n(b) Lowest corresponding price. Providers of eligi-\nble services shall not submit bids for or charge schools, \nschool districts, libraries, library consortia, or consor-\ntia including any of these entities a price above the \nlowest corresponding price for supported services, un-\nless the Commission, with respect to interstate ser-\nvices or the state commission with respect to intra-\nstate services, finds that the lowest corresponding \nprice is not compensatory. Promotional rates offered \nby a service provider for a period of more than 90 days \nmust be included among the comparable rates upon \nwhich the lowest corresponding price is determined. \n \n \n\n68a \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.603 provides: \nConsortia, telecommunications services, and \nexisting contracts. \n(a) Consortia. \n \n(1) Under the Telecommunications Program, an el-\nigible health care provider may join a consortium with \nother eligible health care providers; with schools, li-\nbraries, and library consortia eligible under subpart F \nof this part; and with public sector (governmental) en-\ntities to order telecommunications services. With one \nexception, eligible health care providers participating \nin consortia with ineligible private sector members \nshall not be eligible for supported services under this \nsubpart. A consortium may include ineligible private \nsector entities if such consortium is only receiving ser-\nvices at tariffed rates or at market rates from those \nproviders who do not file tariffs. \n \n(2) For consortia, universal service support under \nthe Telecommunications Program shall apply only to \nthe portion of eligible services used by an eligible \nhealth care provider. \n(b) Telecommunications services. Any telecommu-\nnications service that is the subject of a properly com-\npleted bona fide request by a rural health care pro-\nvider shall be eligible for universal service support. \nUpon submitting a bona fide request to a telecommu-\nnications carrier, each eligible rural health care pro-\nvider is entitled to receive the most cost-effective, com-\nmercially-available telecommunications service, and a \ntelecommunications service carrier that is eligible for \nsupport under the Telecommunications Program shall \nprovide such service at the urban rate, as defined in \n\u00a7 54.604. \n\n69a \n(c) Existing contracts. A signed contract for services \neligible for Telecommunications Program support \npursuant to this subpart between an eligible health \ncare provider, as defined under \u00a7 54.600, and a service \nprovider shall be exempt from the competitive bid re-\nquirements as set forth in \u00a7 54.622(i). \n \n \n\n70a \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.604 provides: \nDetermining the urban rate. \n(a) Effective funding year 2024: \n \n(1) If a rural health care provider requests support \nfor an eligible service to be funded from the Telecom-\nmunications Program that is to be provided over a dis-\ntance that is less than or equal to the \u201cstandard urban \ndistance,\u201d as defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this sec-\ntion, for the state in which it is located, the \u201curban \nrate\u201d for that service shall be a rate no higher than the \nhighest tariffed or publicly-available rate charged to a \ncommercial customer for a functionally similar service \nin any city with a population of 50,000 or more in that \nstate, calculated as if it were provided between two \npoints within the city. \n \n(2) If a rural health care provider requests an eli-\ngible service to be provided over a distance that is \ngreater than the \u201cstandard urban distance,\u201d as de-\nfined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, for the state \nin which it is located, the urban rate for that service \nshall be a rate no higher than the highest tariffed or \npublicly-available rate charged to a commercial cus-\ntomer for a functionally similar service provided over \nthe standard urban distance in any city with a popu-\nlation of 50,000 or more in that state, calculated as if \nthe service were provided between two points within \nthe city. \n \n(3) The \u201cstandard urban distance\u201d for a state is the \naverage of the longest diameters of all cities with a \npopulation of 50,000 or more within the state. \n \n(4) The Administrator shall calculate the \u201cstand-\nard urban distance\u201d and shall post the \u201cstandard ur-\nban distance\u201d and the maximum supported distance \n\n71a \nfor each state on its website. \n(b) As of funding year 2025, if a rural health care pro-\nvider requests support for an eligible service to be \nfunded from the Telecommunications Program the \n\u201curban rate\u201d for that service shall be a rate no higher \nthan the highest tariffed or publicly-available rate \ncharged to a commercial customer for a functionally \nsimilar service in any city with a population of 50,000 \nor more in that state, calculated as if it were provided \nbetween two points within the city. \n \n \n\n72a \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.605 provides: \nDetermining the rural rate. \n(a) Effective funding year 2024, the rural rate shall be \nthe average of the rates actually being charged to com-\nmercial customers, other than health care providers, \nfor identical or similar services provided by the tele-\ncommunications carrier providing the service in the \nrural area in which the health care provider is located. \nThe rates included in this average shall be for services \nprovided over the same distance as the eligible ser-\nvice. The rates averaged to calculate the rural rate \nmust not include any rates reduced by universal ser-\nvice support mechanisms. The \u201crural rate\u201d shall be \nused as described in this subpart to determine the \ncredit or reimbursement due to a telecommunications \ncarrier that provides eligible telecommunications ser-\nvices to eligible health care providers. \n(b) If the telecommunications carrier serving the \nhealth care provider is not providing any identical or \nsimilar services in the rural area, then the rural rate \nshall be the average of the tariffed and other publicly \navailable rates, not including any rates reduced by \nuniversal service programs, charged for the same or \nsimilar services in that rural area over the same dis-\ntance as the eligible service by other carriers. If there \nare no tariffed or publicly available rates for such ser-\nvices in that rural area, or if the carrier reasonably \ndetermines that this method for calculating the rural \nrate is unfair, then the carrier shall submit for the \nstate commission\u2019s approval, for intrastate rates, or \nfor the Commission\u2019s approval, for interstate rates, a \ncost-based rate for the provision of the service in the \nmost economically efficient, reasonably available \nmanner. \n\n73a \n \n(1) The carrier must provide, to the state commis-\nsion, for intrastate rates, or to the Commission, for in-\nterstate rates, a justification of the proposed rural \nrate, including an itemization of the costs of providing \nthe requested service. \n \n(2) The carrier must provide such information pe-\nriodically thereafter as required, by the state commis-\nsion for intrastate rates or the Commission for inter-\nstate rates. In doing so, the carrier much take into ac-\ncount anticipated and actual demand for telecommu-\nnications services by all customers who will use the \nfacilities over which services are being provided to el-\nigible health care providers. \n \n \n\n74a \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.606 provides: \nCalculating support. \n(a) The amount of universal service support provided \nfor an eligible service to be funded from the Telecom-\nmunications program shall be the difference, if any, \nbetween the urban rate and the rural rate charged for \nthe services, as defined in this section. In addition, all \nreasonable charges that are incurred by taking such \nservices, such as state and federal taxes, shall be eli-\ngible for universal service support. Charges for termi-\nnation liability, penalty surcharges, and other charges \nnot included in the cost of taking such service shall \nnot be covered by the universal service support mech-\nanisms. \n(b) The universal service support mechanisms shall \nprovide support for intrastate telecommunications \nservices, as set forth in \u00a7 54.101(a), provided to rural \nhealth care providers as well as interstate telecommu-\nnications services. \n(c) Mobile rural health care providers \u2014 \n \n(1) Calculation of support. The support amount \nallowed under the Telecommunications Program for \nsatellite services provided to mobile rural health care \nproviders is calculated by comparing the rate for the \nsatellite service to the rate for an urban wireline ser-\nvice with a similar bandwidth. Support for satellite \nservices shall not be capped at an amount of a func-\ntionally similar wireline alternative. Where the mo-\nbile rural health care provider provides service in \nmore than one state, the calculation shall be based on \nthe urban areas in each state, proportional to the \nnumber of locations served in each state. \n\n75a \n \n(2) Documentation of support. \n \n(i) Mobile rural health care providers shall pro-\nvide to the Administrator documentation of the \nprice of bandwidth equivalent wireline services in \nthe urban area in the state or states where the ser-\nvice is provided. Mobile rural health care providers \nshall provide to the Administrator the number of \nsites the mobile health care provider will serve \nduring the funding year. \n \n(ii) Where a mobile rural health care provider \nserves less than eight different sites per year, the \nmobile rural health care provider shall provide to \nthe Administrator documentation of the price of \nbandwidth equivalent wireline services. In such \ncase, the Administrator shall determine on a case-\nby-case basis whether the telecommunications ser-\nvice selected by the mobile rural health care pro-\nvider is the most cost-effective option. Where a mo-\nbile rural health care provider seeks a more expen-\nsive satellite-based service when a less expensive \nwireline alternative is most cost-effective, the mo-\nbile rural health care provider shall be responsible \nfor the additional cost. \n \n \n\n76a \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.622 provides: \nCompetitive bidding requirements and exemp-\ntions. \n(a) Competitive bidding requirement. All appli-\ncants are required to engage in a competitive bidding \nprocess for supported services, facilities, or equip-\nment, as applicable, consistent with the requirements \nset forth in this section and any additional applicable \nstate, Tribal, local, or other procurement require-\nments, unless they qualify for an exemption listed in \nparagraph (i) in this section. In addition, applicants \nmay engage in competitive bidding even if they qual-\nify for an exemption. Applicants who utilize a compet-\nitive bidding exemption may proceed directly to filing \na funding request as described in \u00a7 54.623. \n(b) Fair and open process. \n \n(1) Applicants participating in the Telecommuni-\ncations Program or Healthcare Connect Fund Pro-\ngram must conduct a fair and open competitive bid-\nding process. The following actions are necessary to \nsatisfy the \u201cfair and open\u201d competitive standard in the \nTelecommunications Program and the Healthcare \nConnect Fund Program: \n \n(i) All potential bidders and service providers \nmust have access to the same information and \nmust be treated in the same manner throughout \nthe procurement process. \n \n(ii) Service providers who intend to bid on sup-\nported services many not simultaneously help the \napplicant complete its request for proposal (RFP) \nor Request for Services form. \n \n(iii) Service providers who have submitted a bid \nto provide supported services, equipment, or \n\n77a \nfacilities to a health care provider may not simul-\ntaneously help the health care provider evaluate \nsubmitted bids or choose a winning bid. \n \n(iv) Applicants must respond to all service pro-\nviders that have submitted questions or proposals \nduring the competitive bidding process. \n \n(v) All applicants and service providers must \ncomply with any applicable state, Tribal, or local \nprocurement laws, in addition to the Commission\u2019s \ncompetitive bidding requirements. The competi-\ntive bidding requirements in this section are not \nintended to preempt such state, Tribal, or local re-\nquirements. \n(c) Selecting a cost-effective service. In selecting a \nprovider of eligible services, the applicant shall care-\nfully consider all bids submitted and must select the \nmost cost-effective means of meeting its specific \nhealth care needs. \u201cCost-effective\u201d is defined as the \nmethod that costs the least after consideration of the \nfeatures, quality of transmission, reliability, and \nother factors that the health care provider deems rel-\nevant to choosing a method of providing the required \nhealth care services. In the Healthcare Connect Fund \nProgram, when choosing the most \u201ccost-effective\u201d bid, \nprice must be a primary factor, but need not be the \nonly primary factor. A non-price factor may receive an \nequal weight to price, but may not receive a greater \nweight than price. \n(d) Bid evaluation criteria. Applicants must de-\nvelop weighted evaluation criteria (e.g., a scoring ma-\ntrix) that demonstrates how the applicant will choose \nthe most cost-effective bid before submitting its re-\nquest for services. The applicant must specify on its \nbid evaluation worksheet and/or scoring matrix the \n\n78a \nrequested services for which it seeks bids, the infor-\nmation provided to bidders to allow bidders to reason-\nably determine the needs of the applicant, its mini-\nmum requirements for the developed weighted evalu-\nation criteria, and each service provider\u2019s proposed \nservice levels for the criteria. The applicant must also \nspecify the disqualification factors, if any, that it will \nuse to remove bids or bidders from further considera-\ntion. After reviewing the bid submissions and identi-\nfying the bids that satisfy the applicant\u2019s specific \nneeds, the applicant must then select the service pro-\nvider that offers the most cost-effective service. \n(e) Request for Services. Applicants must submit the \nfollowing documents to the Administrator in order to \ninitiate competitive bidding: \n \n(1) Request for Services, including certifica-\ntions. The applicant must submit a Request for Ser-\nvices and make the following certifications as part of \nits Request for Services: \n \n(i) The entity seeking supported services is a \npublic or nonprofit health care provider that falls \nwithin one of the categories set forth in the defini-\ntion of health care provider listed in \u00a7 54.600, or \nexpects to be such a public or nonprofit health care \nprovider before the end of the funding year for \nwhich the supported services are requested pro-\nvided that the entity has received a conditional ap-\nproval of eligibility pursuant to \u00a7 54.601(c); \n \n(ii) The health care provider seeking supported \nservices is physically located in a rural area as de-\nfined in \u00a7 54.600 or is a member of a Healthcare \nConnect Fund Program consortium which satisfies \nthe rural health care provider composition require-\nments set forth in \u00a7 54.607(b). If an entity seeks \n\n79a \nsupported services under a conditional approval of \neligibility set forth in \u00a7 54.601(c), the entity ex-\npects to be located in a rural area defined in \n\u00a7 54.600 before the end of the funding year for \nwhich the supported services are requested, or \nplans to be a member of a Healthcare Connect \nFund Program consortium which satisfies the ru-\nral health care provider composition requirements \nset forth in \u00a7 54.607(b) before the end of the fund-\ning year for which the supported services are re-\nquested; \n(iii) The person signing the application is au-\nthorized to submit the application on behalf of the \nhealth care provider or consortium applicant; \n \n(iv) The person signing the application has ex-\namined the Request for Services and all attach-\nments, and to the best of his or her knowledge, in-\nformation, and belief, all statements contained in \nthe request are true; \n \n(v) The applicant has complied with any appli-\ncable state, Tribal, or local procurement rules; \n \n(vi) All requested Rural Health Care Program \nsupport will be used solely for purposes reasonably \nrelated to the provision of health care service or in-\nstruction that the health care provider is legally \nauthorized to provide under the law of the state in \nwhich the services are provided; \n \n(vii) The supported services will not be sold, re-\nsold, or transferred in consideration for money or \nany other thing of value; \n \n(viii) The applicant satisfies all of the require-\nments under section 254 of the Act and applicable \nCommission rules; and \n\n80a \n \n(ix) The applicant has reviewed all applicable \nrequirements for the Telecommunications Pro-\ngram or the Healthcare Connect Fund Program, as \napplicable, and will comply with those require-\nments. \n \n(2) Aggregated purchase details. If the service \nor services are being purchased as part of an aggre-\ngated purchase with other entities or individuals, the \nfull details of any such arrangement, including the \nidentities of all co-purchasers and the portion of the \nservice or services being purchased by the health care \nprovider, must be submitted. \n \n(3) Bid evaluation criteria. Requirements for \nbid evaluation criteria are described in paragraph (d) \nin this section and must be included with the appli-\ncant\u2019s Request for Services. \n \n(4) Declaration of Assistance. All applicants \nmust submit a \u201cDeclaration of Assistance\u201d with their \nRequest for Services. In the Declaration of Assistance, \nthe applicant must identify each and every consult-\nant, service provider, and other outside expert, \nwhether paid or unpaid, who aided in the preparation \nof its applications. The applicant must also describe \nthe nature of the relationship it has with each consult-\nant, service provider, or other outside expert provid-\ning such assistance. \n \n(5) Request for proposal (if applicable). \n \n(i) Any applicant may use an RFP.

Contributions to the mechanisms begin-\nning April 1, 2003 shall be based on contributors\u2019 pro-\njected collected end-user telecommunications reve-\nnues, and on a contribution factor determined quar-\nterly by the Commission. \n \n(1) For funding the federal universal service sup-\nport mechanisms prior to April 1, 2003, the subject \nrevenues will be contributors\u2019 interstate and interna-\ntional revenues derived from domestic end users for \ntelecommunications or telecommunications services, \nnet of prior period actual contributions. Beginning \nApril 1, 2003, the subject revenues will be contribu-\ntors\u2019 projected collected interstate and international \nrevenues derived from domestic end users for telecom-\nmunications or telecommunications services, net of \nprojected contributions. \n \n(2) Prior to April 1, 2003, the quarterly universal \nservice contribution factor shall be determined by the \nCommission based on the ratio of total projected quar-\nterly expenses of the universal service support mech-\nanisms to the total end-user interstate and interna-\ntional telecommunications revenues, net of prior pe-\nriod actual contributions. Beginning April 1, 2003, the \nquarterly universal service contribution factor shall \nbe determined by the Commission based on the ratio \nof total projected quarterly expenses of the universal \nservice support mechanisms to the total projected \n\n95a \ncollected end-user interstate and international tele-\ncommunications revenues, net of projected contribu-\ntions. The Commission shall approve the Administra-\ntor\u2019s quarterly projected costs of the universal service \nsupport mechanisms, taking into account demand for \nsupport and administrative expenses. The total sub-\nject revenues shall be compiled by the Administrator \nbased on information contained in the Telecommuni-\ncations \nReporting \nWorksheets \ndescribed \nin \n\u00a7 54.711(a). \n \n(3) Total projected expenses for the federal univer-\nsal service support mechanisms for each quarter must \nbe approved by the Commission before they are used \nto calculate the quarterly contribution factor and in-\ndividual contributions. For each quarter, the Admin-\nistrator must submit its projections of demand for the \nfederal universal service support mechanisms for \nhigh-cost areas, low-income consumers, schools and li-\nbraries, and rural health care providers, respectively, \nand the basis for those projections, to the Commission \nand the Office of the Managing Director at least sixty \n(60) calendar days prior to the start of that quarter. \nFor each quarter, the Administrator must submit its \nprojections of administrative expenses for the high-\ncost mechanism, the low-income mechanism, the \nschools and libraries mechanism and the rural health \ncare mechanism and the basis for those projections to \nthe Commission and the Office of the Managing Direc-\ntor at least sixty (60) calendar days prior to the start \nof that quarter. Based on data submitted to the Ad-\nministrator on the Telecommunications Reporting \nWorksheets, the Administrator must submit the total \ncontribution base to the Office of the Managing Direc-\ntor at least thirty (30) days before the start of each \nquarter. The projections of demand and administra-\ntive expenses and the contribution factor shall be \n\n96a \nannounced by the Commission in a public notice and \nshall be made available on the Commission\u2019s website. \nThe Commission reserves the right to set projections \nof demand and administrative expenses at amounts \nthat the Commission determines will serve the public \ninterest at any time within the fourteen-day period \nfollowing release of the Commission\u2019s public notice. If \nthe Commission take no action within fourteen (14) \ndays of the date of release of the public notice an-\nnouncing the projections of demand and administra-\ntive expenses, the projections of demand and admin-\nistrative expenses, and the contribution factor shall be \ndeemed approved by the Commission. Except as pro-\nvided in \u00a7 54.706(c), the Administrator shall apply the \nquarterly contribution factor, once approved by the \nCommission, to contributor\u2019s interstate and interna-\ntional end-user telecommunications revenues to cal-\nculate the amount of individual contributions. \n(b) If the contributions received by the Administrator \nin a quarter exceed the amount of universal service \nsupport program contributions and administrative \ncosts for that quarter, the excess payments will be car-\nried forward to the following quarter. The contribu-\ntion factors for the following quarter will take into \nconsideration the projected costs of the support mech-\nanisms for that quarter and the excess contributions \ncarried over from the previous quarter. The Commis-\nsion may instruct the Administrator to treat excess \ncontributions in a manner other than as prescribed in \nthis paragraph (b). Such instructions may be made in \nthe form of a Commission Order or a public notice re-\nleased by the Wireline Competition Bureau. Any such \npublic notice will become effective fourteen days after \nrelease of the public notice, absent further Commis-\nsion action. \n\n97a \n(c) If the contributions received by the Administrator \nin a quarter are inadequate to meet the amount of uni-\nversal service support program payments and admin-\nistrative costs for that quarter, the Administrator \nshall request authority from the Commission to bor-\nrow funds commercially, with such debt secured by fu-\nture contributions. Subsequent contribution factors \nwill take into consideration the projected costs of the \nsupport mechanisms and the additional costs associ-\nated with borrowing funds. \n(d) If a contributor fails to file a Telecommunications \nReporting Worksheet by the date on which it is due, \nthe Administrator shall bill that contributor based on \nwhatever relevant data the Administrator has availa-\nble, including, but not limited to, the number of lines \npresubscribed to the contributor and data from previ-\nous years, taking into consideration any estimated \nchanges in such data. \n \n \n\n98a \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.711 provides: \nContributor reporting requirements. \n(a) Contributions shall be calculated and filed in ac-\ncordance with the Telecommunications Reporting \nWorksheet which shall be published in the FEDERAL \nREGISTER. The Telecommunications Reporting Work-\nsheet sets forth information that the contributor must \nsubmit to the Administrator on a quarterly and an-\nnual basis. The Commission shall announce by Public \nNotice published in the FEDERAL REGISTER and on its \nwebsite the manner of payment and dates by which \npayments must be made. An executive officer of the \ncontributor must certify to the truth and accuracy of \nhistorical data included in the Telecommunications \nReporting Worksheet, and that any projections in the \nTelecommunications Reporting Worksheet represent \na good-faith estimate based on the contributor\u2019s poli-\ncies and procedures. The Commission or the Adminis-\ntrator may verify any information contained in the \nTelecommunications Reporting Worksheet. Contribu-\ntors shall maintain records and documentation to jus-\ntify information reported in the Telecommunications \nReporting Worksheet, including the methodology \nused to determine projections, for three years and \nshall provide such records and documentation to the \nCommission or the Administrator upon request. Inac-\ncurate or untruthful information contained in the Tel-\necommunications Reporting Worksheet may lead to \nprosecution under the criminal provisions of Title 18 \nof the United States Code. The Administrator shall \nadvise the Commission of any enforcement issues that \narise and provide any suggested response. \n(b) The Commission shall have access to all data re-\nported to the Administrator. Contributors may make \n\n99a \nrequests for Commission nondisclosure of company-\nspecific revenue information under \u00a7 0.459 of this \nchapter by so indicating on the Telecommunications \nReporting Worksheet at the time that the subject data \nare submitted. The Commission shall make all deci-\nsions regarding nondisclosure of company-specific in-\nformation. The Administrator shall keep confidential \nall data obtained from contributors, shall not use such \ndata except for purposes of administering the univer-\nsal service support programs, and shall not disclose \nsuch data in company-specific form unless directed to \ndo so by the Commission.

The \nAdministrator shall keep confidential all data ob-\ntained from other administrators and shall not use \nsuch data except for purposes of administering the \nuniversal service support mechanisms. \n(c) The Bureau may waive, reduce, modify, or elimi-\nnate contributor reporting requirements that prove \nunnecessary and require additional reporting require-\nments that the Bureau deems necessary to the sound \nand efficient administration of the universal service \nsupport mechanisms. \n \n \n\n100a \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.717 provides: \nAudits of the Administrator. \nThe Administrator shall obtain and pay for an annual \naudit conducted by an independent auditor to exam-\nine its operations and books of account to determine, \namong other things, whether the Administrator is \nproperly administering the universal service support \nmechanisms to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse: \n(a) Before selecting an independent auditor, the Ad-\nministrator shall submit preliminary audit require-\nments, including the proposed scope of the audit and \nthe extent of compliance and substantive testing, to \nthe Office of Managing Director. \n(b) The Office of Managing Director shall review the \npreliminary audit requirements to determine whether \nthey are adequate to meet the audit objectives. The \nOffice of Managing Director shall prescribe modifica-\ntions that shall be incorporated into the final audit re-\nquirements. \n(c) After the audit requirements have been approved \nby the Office of Managing Director, the Administrator \nshall engage within thirty (30) calendar days an inde-\npendent auditor to conduct the annual audit required \nby this paragraph. In making its selection, the Admin-\nistrator shall not engage any independent auditor who \nhas been involved in designing any of the accounting \nor reporting systems under review in the audit. \n(d) The independent auditor selected by the Adminis-\ntrator to conduct the annual audit shall be instructed \nby the Administrator to develop a detailed audit pro-\ngram based on the final audit requirements and shall \nbe instructed by the Administrator to submit the au-\ndit program to the Office of Managing Director. The \n\n101a \nOffice of Managing Director shall review the audit \nprogram and make modifications, as needed, that \nshall be incorporated into the final audit program. \nDuring the course of the audit, the Office of Managing \nDirector may direct the Administrator to direct the in-\ndependent auditor to take any actions necessary to en-\nsure compliance with the audit requirements. \n(e) During the course of the audit, the Administrator \nshall instruct the independent auditor to: \n \n(1) Inform the Office of Managing Director of any \nrevisions to the final audit program or to the scope of \nthe audit; \n \n(2) Notify the Office of Managing Director of any \nmeetings with the Administrator in which audit find-\nings are discussed; and \n \n(3) Submit to the Chief of the Wireline Competition \nBureau any accounting or rule interpretations neces-\nsary to complete the audit. \n(f) Within 105 calendar days after the end of the audit \nperiod, but prior to discussing the audit findings with \nthe Administrator, the independent auditor shall be \ninstructed by the Administrator to submit a draft of \nthe audit report to the Office of Managing Director \nAudit Staff. \n(g) The Office of Managing Director shall review the \naudit findings and audit workpapers and offer its rec-\nommendations concerning the conduct of the audit or \nthe audit findings to the independent auditor. Excep-\ntions of the Office of Managing Director to the findings \nand conclusions of the independent auditor that re-\nmain unresolved shall be included in the final audit \nreport. \n(h) Within fifteen (15) calendar days after receiving \n\n102a \nthe Office of Managing Director\u2019s recommendations \nand making any revisions to the audit report, the Ad-\nministrator shall instruct the independent auditor to \nsubmit the audit report to the Administrator for its \nresponse to the audit findings. At this time the auditor \nalso must send copies of its audit findings to the Office \nof Managing Director.

Rural \nDigital Opportunity Fund support may be made avail-\nable for census blocks or other areas identified as eli-\ngible by public notice. \n(b) Term of support. Rural Digital Opportunity Fund \nsupport shall be provided for ten years. \n(c) Deployment obligation.  \n \n(1) All recipients of Rural Digital Opportunity \nFund support must complete deployment to 40 per-\ncent of the required number of locations as deter-\nmined by the Connect America Cost Model by the end \nof the third year, to 60 percent by the end of the fourth \nyear, and to 80 percent by the end of the fifth year. \nThe Wireline Competition Bureau will publish up-\ndated location counts no later than the end of the sixth \nyear. A support recipient\u2019s final service milestones \nwill depend on whether the Wireline Competition Bu-\nreau determines there are more or fewer locations \nthan determined by the Connect America Cost Model \nin the relevant areas as follows: \n \n(i) More Locations. After the Wireline Compe-\ntition Bureau adopts updated location counts, in \nareas where there are more locations than the \nnumber of locations determined by the Connect \nAmerica Cost Model, recipients of Rural Digital \nOpportunity Fund support must complete deploy-\nment to 100 percent of the number of locations de-\ntermined by the Connect America Cost Model by \nthe end of the sixth year. Recipients of Rural \n\n107a \nDigital Opportunity Fund support must then com-\nplete deployment to 100 percent of the additional \nnumber of locations determined by the Wireline \nCompetition Bureau\u2019s updated location count by \nend of the eighth year. If the new location count \nexceeds 35% of the number of locations determined \nby the Connect America Cost Model within their \narea in each state, recipients of Rural Digital Op-\nportunity Fund support will have the opportunity \nto seek additional support or relief. \n \n(ii) Fewer Locations. In areas where there are \nfewer locations than the number of locations deter-\nmined by the Connect America Cost Model, a Rural \nDigital Opportunity Fund support recipient must \nnotify the Wireline Competition Bureau no later \nthan March 1 following the fifth year of deploy-\nment. Upon confirmation by the Wireline Compe-\ntition Bureau, Rural Digital Opportunity Fund \nsupport recipients must complete deployment to \nthe number of locations required by the new loca-\ntion count by the end of the sixth year. Support re-\ncipients for which the new location count is less \nthan 65 percent of the Connect America Cost \nModel locations within their area in each state \nshall have the support amount reduced on a pro \nrata basis by the number of reduced locations. \n \n(iii) Newly Built Locations. In addition to of-\nfering the required service to the updated number \nof locations identified by the Wireline Competition \nBureau, Rural Digital Opportunity Fund support \nrecipients must offer service to locations built since \nthe revised count, upon reasonable request. Sup-\nport recipients are not required to deploy to any lo-\ncation built after milestone year eight. \n\n108a \n(d) Disbursement of Rural Digital Opportunity \nFund funding.

For \npurposes of determining reasonable comparable usage \ncapacity, recipients are presumed to meet this re-\nquirement if they meet or exceed the usage level an-\nnounced by public notice issued by the Wireline Com-\npetition Bureau. For purposes of determining reason-\nable comparability of rates, recipients are presumed \nto meet this requirement if they offer rates at or below \nthe applicable benchmark to be announced annually \nby public notice issued by the Wireline Competition \nBureau, or no more than the non-promotional prices \ncharged for a comparable fixed wireline service in ur-\nban areas in the state or U.S. Territory where the eli-\ngible telecommunications carrier receives support. \n(b) Recipients of Rural Digital Opportunity Fund sup-\nport are required to offer broadband service meeting \nthe performance standards for the relevant perfor-\nmance tier. \n \n(1) Rural Digital Opportunity Fund support recip-\nients meeting the minimum performance tier stand-\nards are required to offer broadband service at actual \nspeeds of at least 25 Mbps downstream and 3 Mbps \nupstream and offer a minimum usage allowance of \n250 GB per month, or that reflects the average usage \nof a majority of fixed broadband customers as \n\n122a \nannounced annually by the Wireline Competition Bu-\nreau over the 10-year term. \n \n(2) Rural Digital Opportunity Fund support recip-\nients meeting the above-baseline performance tier \nstandards are required to offer broadband service at \nactual speeds of at least 100 Mbps downstream and \n20 Mbps upstream and offer at least 2 terabytes of \nmonthly usage. \n \n(3) Rural Digital Opportunity Fund support recip-\nients meeting the Gigabit performance tier standards \nare required to offer broadband service at actual \nspeeds of at least 1 Gigabit per second downstream \nand 500 Mbps upstream and offer at least 2 terabytes \nof monthly usage. \n \n(4) For each of the tiers in paragraphs (b)(1) \nthrough (3) of this section, bidders are required to \nmeet one of two latency performance levels: \n \n(i) Low-latency bidders will be required to meet \n95 percent or more of all peak period measure-\nments of network round trip latency at or below \n100 milliseconds; and \n \n(ii) High-latency bidders will be required to \nmeet 95 percent or more of all peak period meas-\nurements of network round trip latency at or below \n750 ms and, with respect to voice performance, \ndemonstrate a score of four or higher using the \nMean Opinion Score (MOS). \n(c) Recipients of Rural Digital Opportunity Fund sup-\nport are required to bid on category one telecommuni-\ncations and internet access services in response to a \nposted FCC Form 470 seeking broadband service that \nmeets the connectivity targets for the schools and li-\nbraries universal service support program for eligible \nschools and libraries (as described in \u00a7 54.501) located \n\n123a \nwithin any area in a census block where the carrier is \nreceiving Rural Digital Opportunity Fund support. \nSuch bids must be at rates reasonably comparable to \nrates charged to eligible schools and libraries in urban \nareas for comparable offerings. \n \n \n\n124a \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.806 provides: \nRural Digital Opportunity Fund reporting obli-\ngations, compliance, and recordkeeping. \n(a) Recipients of Rural Digital Opportunity Fund sup-\nport shall be subject to the reporting obligations set \nforth in \u00a7\u00a7 54.313, 54.314, and 54.316. \n(b) Recipients of Rural Digital Opportunity Fund sup-\nport shall be subject to the compliance measures, \nrecordkeeping requirements and audit requirements \nset forth in \u00a7 54.320(a)-(c). \n(c) Recipients of Rural Digital Opportunity Fund sup-\nport shall be subject to the non-compliance measures \nset forth in \u00a7 54.320(d) subject to the following modi-\nfications related to the recovery of support. \n \n(1) If the support recipient does not report it has \ncome into full compliance after the grace period for its \nsixth year or eighth year service milestone as applica-\nble or if USAC determines in the course of a compli-\nance review that the eligible telecommunications car-\nrier does not have sufficient evidence to demonstrate \nthat it is offering service to all of the locations re-\nquired by the sixth or eighth year service milestone as \nset forth in \u00a7 54.320(d)(3): \n \n(i) Sixth year service milestone. Support will be \nrecovered as follows after the sixth year service \nmilestone grace period or if USAC later determines \nin the course of a compliance review that a support \nrecipient does not have sufficient evidence to \ndemonstrate that it was offering service to all of \nthe locations required by the sixth year service \nmilestone: \n \n(A) If an ETC has deployed to 95 percent or \nmore of the Connect America Cost Model \n\n125a \nlocation count or the adjusted Connect America \nCost Model location count if there are fewer lo-\ncations, but less than 100 percent, USAC will \nrecover an amount of support that is equal to \n1.25 times the average amount of support per \nlocation received in the state for that ETC over \nthe support term for the relevant number of lo-\ncations; \n \n(B) If an ETC has deployed to 90 percent or \nmore of the Connect America Cost Model loca-\ntion count or the adjusted Connect America \nCost Model location count if there are fewer lo-\ncations, but less than 95 percent, USAC will re-\ncover an amount of support that is equal to \n1.5 times the average amount of support per lo-\ncation received in the state for that ETC over \nthe support term for the relevant number of lo-\ncations, plus 5 percent of the support recipient\u2019s \ntotal Rural Digital Opportunity Fund support \nauthorized over the 10-year support term for \nthat state; \n \n(C) If an ETC has deployed to fewer than \n90 percent of the Connect America Cost Model \nlocation count or the adjusted Connect America \nCost Model location count if there are fewer lo-\ncations, USAC will recover an amount of sup-\nport that is equal to 1.75 times the average \namount of support per location received in the \nstate for that ETC over the support term for the \nrelevant number of locations, plus 10 percent of \nthe support recipient\u2019s total Rural Digital Op-\nportunity Fund support authorized over the \n10-year support term for that state. \n \n(ii) Eighth year service milestone. If a Rural \nDigital Opportunity Fund support recipient is \n\n126a \nrequired to serve more new locations than deter-\nmined by the Connect America Cost Model, sup-\nport will be recovered as follows after the eighth \nyear service milestone grace period or if USAC \nlater determines in the course of a compliance re-\nview that a support recipient does not have suffi-\ncient evidence to demonstrate that it was offering \nservice to all of the locations required by the eighth \nyear service milestone: \n \n(A) If an ETC has deployed to 95 percent or \nmore of its new location count, but less than 100 \npercent, USAC will recover an amount of sup-\nport that is equal to the average amount of sup-\nport per location received in the state for that \nETC over the support term for the relevant \nnumber of locations; \n \n(B) If an ETC has deployed to 90 percent or \nmore of its new location count, but less than \n95 percent, USAC will recover an amount of \nsupport that is equal to 1.25 times the average \namount of support per location received in the \nstate for that ETC over the support term for the \nrelevant number of locations; \n \n(C) If an ETC has deployed to 85 percent or \nmore of its new location count, but less than \n90 percent, USAC will recover an amount of \nsupport that is equal to 1.5 times the average \namount of support per location received in the \nstate for that ETC over the support term for the \nrelevant number of locations, plus 5 percent of \nthe support recipient\u2019s total Rural Digital Op-\nportunity Fund support authorized over the \n10-year support term for that state; \n\n127a \n \n(D) If an ETC has deployed to less than \n85 percent of its new location count, USAC will \nrecover an amount of support that is equal to \n1.75 times the average amount of support per \nlocation received in the state for that ETC over \nthe support term for the relevant number of lo-\ncations, plus 10 percent of the support recipi-\nent\u2019s total Rural Digital Opportunity Fund sup-\nport authorized over the 10-year support term \nfor that state. \n \n(2) Any support recipient that believes it cannot \nmeet the third-year service milestone must notify the \nWireline Competition Bureau within 10 business days \nof the third-year service milestone deadline and pro-\nvide information explaining this expected deficiency. \nIf a support recipient has not made such a notification \nby March 1 following the third-year service milestone, \nand has deployed to fewer than 20 percent of the re-\nquired number of locations by the end of the third \nyear, the recipient will immediately be in default and \nsubject to support recovery. The Tier 4 status six-\nmonth grace period as set forth in \u00a7 54.320(d)(iv) will \nnot be applicable.",

The Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s March 24, 2023, vacated panel opinion \n(Pet.App.125a) is reported at 63 F.4th 441. \nJURISDICTION \nThis Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1254(1). The en banc Fifth Circuit entered its \njudgment on July 24, 2024. \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \nRespondents in this case (\u201cthe Challengers\u201d) have \nlong contended that the taxing system used to fund \nthe \nUniversal \nService \nFund \n(\u201cUSF\u201d) \nis \nunconstitutional under nondelegation principles. \nIndeed, the Challengers include all petitioners in two \nother cases currently pending before this Court \nraising nondelegation challenges to the USF. See \nConsumers\u2019 Research v. FCC, Nos. 23-456 & 23-743 \n(certiorari denied June 10, 2024; rehearing sought \nJune 18, 2024). Those cases arose out of the Sixth and \nEleventh Circuits, respectively. \nThe en banc Fifth Circuit\u2019s scholarly decision \nbelow adopted the Challengers\u2019 arguments and held \nthe USF funding mechanism violates Article I of the \nU.S. Constitution. As the en banc Fifth Circuit \nexplained, \u201cthere is no record of any government \nprogram like [the] USF in all the U.S. Reports.\u201d \nPet.App.67a. Rather than pay for a multi-billion-\ndollar social welfare program with an appropriation \nfrom \nfederal \nrevenues, \nCongress \nrequires \ntelecommunications carriers to contribute to the USF, \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(d), with carriers passing along a \nportion of that cost to consumers via line-item charges \nin their monthly phone bills, 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.712(a). \nThe collected funds are then redistributed by the \nprivate Universal Service Administrative Company \n(\u201cUSAC\u201d) to entities and projects that ostensibly will \nexpand telecommunications services. 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(b), (e). \n\n3 \n \nBut Congress imposed no formula, ceiling, or other \nmeaningful restrictions on how much money can be \nraised for the USF. To be sure, Congress provided a \nlist of universal service \u201cprinciples.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(b). But they are so amorphous and non-binding \nthat courts\u2014adopting the FCC\u2019s own language\u2014have \nlong labeled them \u201caspirational only,\u201d Tex. Off. of Pub. \nUtil. Couns. v. FCC, 265 F.3d 313, 321 (5th Cir. 2001), \nmeaning Congress \u201csuppl[ied] no principle at all,\u201d \nPet.App.27a. \nIn \naddition, \nCongress \nexpressly \nauthorized the FCC to redefine \u201cuniversal service\u201d and \n\u201cuniversal service principles\u201d as often as it wishes, \ngiving the agency even broader authority to raise \nbillions of dollars in taxes for a program designed to \nbenefit the country more broadly. See 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(b)(7), (c)(1). \nThe FCC then off-loaded authority over the USF to \nUSAC, a private entity of self-described industry \ninsiders with an incentive to push USF charges \nincreasingly higher. Each quarter, USAC exercises its \ndiscretion in determining the desired budget for the \nUSF, which includes the cost of funding USAC itself. \nThe FCC then ministerially converts that figure into \na contribution factor that will apply to certain \ntelecommunications revenues, and that tax rate is \nthen passively \u201cdeemed approved\u201d by the FCC 14 days \nlater, without the FCC ever taking any affirmative \naction or even issuing an approval order. 47 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 54.709(a)(3). There is no evidence the FCC itself \never actually reviews USAC\u2019s work or agrees with \nUSAC\u2019s discretionary decisions about how much \n\n4 \n \nmoney to raise, which is far from a ministerial \nundertaking. \nThis entire process happens only days before the \nnew quarter begins, giving the FCC no real option but \nto accept whatever numbers USAC demands. USAC \nthen collects the forced contributions and chooses how \nto disburse the funds. In essence, a private company \nis taxing Americans in amounts that total billions of \ndollars every year, under penalty of law, without true \ngovernmental accountability. \nThe en banc Fifth Circuit correctly held the USF\u2019s \nrevenue raising is unconstitutional under Article I of \nthe U.S. Constitution. See Pet.App.64a\u201381a. The \ncourt concluded there are \u201cgrave concerns about \n\u00a7 254\u2019s constitutionality under the Supreme Court\u2019s \nnondelegation precedents,\u201d as Congress handed over \nits core legislative taxing power to an agency with \nnothing \nmore \nthan \n\u201c\u2018aspirational\u2019\u201d \nlimits. \nPet.App.28a\u201329a, 42a. The Fifth Circuit also had \n\u201cserious trouble squaring FCC\u2019s subdelegation [to \nUSAC] with Article I, \u00a7 1 of the Constitution.\u201d \nPet.App.54a\u201355a. \nRather than hold independently unconstitutional \nCongress\u2019s delegation to the FCC and the FCC\u2019s \ndelegation to USAC, the Court concluded that the \ncombination \nwas \nunconstitutional. \n\u201c[T]he \nunprecedented nature of the delegation\u201d of broad \ntaxing power from Congress to the FCC, \u201ccombined \nwith other factors\u201d like the FCC\u2019s subsequent \nredelegation to USAC, was more than \u201cenough to hold \n[the USF] unlawful.\u201d Pet.App.42a. \n\n5 \n \nThe dual layers of delegation\u2014from Congress to \nthe FCC, then from the FCC to USAC\u2014\u201cobscure lines \nof accountability the Framers intended to be clear\u201d \nand \u201crender the promise of recourse to the judiciary \nillusory because they give reviewing courts no \nstandard against which to measure the compatibility \nof executive action with the prescriptions of the \npeople\u2019s elected representatives.\u201d Pet.App.75a. \nThe \nFifth \nCircuit \nconcluded: \n\u201cAmerican \ntelecommunications consumers are subject to a \nmultibillion-dollar tax nobody voted for. The size of \nthat tax is de facto determined by a trade group \nstaffed by industry insiders with no semblance of \naccountability to the public. And the trade group in \nturn relies on projections made by its private, for-\nprofit constituent companies, all of which stand to \nprofit \nfrom \nevery \nsingle \ntax \nincrease. \nThis \ncombination of delegations, subdelegations, and \nobfuscations of the USF Tax mechanism offends \nArticle I, \u00a7 1 of the Constitution.\u201d Pet.App.81a. \nConcurring, several judges would have gone \nfurther, explaining that \u201cCongress\u2019s delegation of \nlegislative power to the FCC and the FCC\u2019s delegation \nof the taxing power to a private entity each \nindividually contravene the separation of powers \nprinciple \nthat \nundergirds \nour \nConstitutional \nRepublic.\u201d Pet.App.82a (Elrod, J., joined by Ho & \nEnglehardt, JJ., concurring) (emphasis added). \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision was unsurprising. \nScholars had long flagged these serious constitutional \nflaws with the USF. \u201cUnlike the thousands of \n\n6 \n \nresponsibilities carried out by governmental agencies \non behalf of Congress, this delegation is unique \nbecause of the unfettered power given to the FCC in \ndefining the scope of universal service, and because \nCongress delegated the power to levy a tax to pay for \nthe service with no limits, knowing that the end user, \nthe American public, would ultimately be saddled \nwith the burden.\u201d Barbara A. Cherry & Donald D. \nNystrom, \nUniversal \nService \nContributions: \nAn \nUnconstitutional Delegation of Taxing Power, 2000 L. \nRev. Mich. St. U. Det. C.L. 107, 110. \nSimilarly, former FCC Commissioner Harold \nFurchtgott-Roth has written that the USF charges are \na \u201chidden tax\u201d where \u201c[t]he FCC, by its own logic, [has] \nas much authority to spend $2.25 trillion as it [has] to \nspend $2.25 billion.\u201d Harold W. Furchtgott-Roth, A \nTough Act to Follow? at 62, 72 (2006). \nThe Challengers consented to the government\u2019s \nrequest to stay the Fifth Circuit\u2019s mandate, on \ncondition that the government file its petition for a \nwrit of certiorari by September 30, 2024. The Fifth \nCircuit granted the government\u2019s request. See Order, \nConsumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, No. 22-60008 (5th Cir. Aug. \n26, 2024), ECF No. 349-2. \nDISCUSSION \nAs noted above, the Challengers filed petitions for \nwrits of certiorari from decisions by the Sixth and \nEleventh Circuits, which rejected the Challengers\u2019 \nnondelegation claims. See Consumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, \nNos. 23-456 & 23-743. The Challengers have sought \n\n7 \n \nrehearing of this Court\u2019s June 2024 denial of those \npetitions. Id. Those rehearing petitions remain \npending. \nGiven their own pending requests for this Court\u2019s \nreview of those adverse rulings, the Challengers agree \nthe constitutionality of the USF funding mechanism \nwarrants this Court\u2019s review. There is also now a \ncircuit split on whether that funding mechanism \nviolates nondelegation principles. \nTime is of the essence because the government \ncontinues to collect funds for the USF despite the \nFifth Circuit\u2019s holding below, as the Fifth Circuit \nagreed to stay its mandate on condition that the \ngovernment file its petition for a writ of certiorari by \nSeptember 30, 2024. See Order, Consumers\u2019 Rsch., No. \n22-60008 (5th Cir. Aug. 26, 2024). \nGiven the time sensitivity, the Court should grant \nthe petitions for rehearing and certiorari in Nos. 23-\n456 and 23-743, which are already fully briefed, and \nthus merits briefing can begin immediately. The \nCourt could then either consolidate all three cases, or \nhold this case pending a decision in Nos. 23-456 and \n23-743. \nThe Court should realign the parties for any \nconsolidated proceedings so the Challengers are \ntreated as petitioners, given that they first sought this \nCourt\u2019s review on these issues and have been \npetitioners in all lower-court proceedings. The Court \nhas previously realigned the parties in cases raising \nthe same issue, consistent with the parties\u2019 status in \n\n8 \n \nthe earlier-filed case. See, e.g., Axon Enter., Inc. v. \nFTC, No. 21-86 & SEC v. Cochran, No. 21-1239 \n(realigned parties so the Government was treated as \nrespondent in both cases); AMG Capital Mgmt., LLC \nv. FTC, No. 19-508 & FTC v. Credit Bureau Ctr., LLC, \nNo. 19-825 (similar). The Court has also previously \ngranted rehearing and then consolidated several \npending cases for merits briefing and argument. See, \ne.g., Al Odah v. United States, No. 06-1196 & \nBoumediene v. Bush, No. 06-1195. \n \n \n\n9 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe petitions for rehearing and for writs of \ncertiorari in Nos. 23-456 and 23-743 should be \ngranted. If the Court grants this case (No. 24-354), \ntoo, it should either hold it pending a decision in Nos. \n23-456 and 23-743, or consolidate the three cases and \nrealign the parties here so the Challengers are treated \nas petitioners. \nROBERT HENNEKE \nCHANCE WELDON \nTEXAS PUBLIC POLICY \nFOUNDATION \n901 Congress Avenue \nAustin, TX 78701 \n(512) 472-2700 \nrhenneke@texaspolicy.com \n \nR.

The Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s March 24, 2023, vacated panel opinion \n(Pet.App.125a) is reported at 63 F.4th 441. \nJURISDICTION \nThis Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1254(1). The en banc Fifth Circuit entered its \njudgment on July 24, 2024. \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \nRespondents in this case (\u201cthe Challengers\u201d) have \nlong contended that the taxing system used to fund \nthe \nUniversal \nService \nFund \n(\u201cUSF\u201d) \nis \nunconstitutional under nondelegation principles. \nIndeed, the Challengers include all petitioners in two \nother cases currently pending before this Court \nraising nondelegation challenges to the USF. See \nConsumers\u2019 Research v. FCC, Nos. 23-456 & 23-743 \n(certiorari denied June 10, 2024; rehearing sought \nJune 18, 2024). Those cases arose out of the Sixth and \nEleventh Circuits, respectively. \nThe en banc Fifth Circuit\u2019s scholarly decision \nbelow adopted the Challengers\u2019 arguments and held \nthe USF funding mechanism violates Article I of the \nU.S. Constitution. As the en banc Fifth Circuit \nexplained, \u201cthere is no record of any government \nprogram like [the] USF in all the U.S. Reports.\u201d \nPet.App.67a. Rather than pay for a multi-billion-\ndollar social welfare program with an appropriation \nfrom \nfederal \nrevenues, \nCongress \nrequires \ntelecommunications carriers to contribute to the USF, \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(d), with carriers passing along a \nportion of that cost to consumers via line-item charges \nin their monthly phone bills, 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.712(a). \nThe collected funds are then redistributed by the \nprivate Universal Service Administrative Company \n(\u201cUSAC\u201d) to entities and projects that ostensibly will \nexpand telecommunications services. 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(b), (e). \n\n3 \n \nBut Congress imposed no formula, ceiling, or other \nmeaningful restrictions on how much money can be \nraised for the USF. To be sure, Congress provided a \nlist of universal service \u201cprinciples.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(b). But they are so amorphous and non-binding \nthat courts\u2014adopting the FCC\u2019s own language\u2014have \nlong labeled them \u201caspirational only,\u201d Tex. Off. of Pub. \nUtil. Couns. v. FCC, 265 F.3d 313, 321 (5th Cir. 2001), \nmeaning Congress \u201csuppl[ied] no principle at all,\u201d \nPet.App.27a. \nIn \naddition, \nCongress \nexpressly \nauthorized the FCC to redefine \u201cuniversal service\u201d and \n\u201cuniversal service principles\u201d as often as it wishes, \ngiving the agency even broader authority to raise \nbillions of dollars in taxes for a program designed to \nbenefit the country more broadly. See 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(b)(7), (c)(1). \nThe FCC then off-loaded authority over the USF to \nUSAC, a private entity of self-described industry \ninsiders with an incentive to push USF charges \nincreasingly higher. Each quarter, USAC exercises its \ndiscretion in determining the desired budget for the \nUSF, which includes the cost of funding USAC itself. \nThe FCC then ministerially converts that figure into \na contribution factor that will apply to certain \ntelecommunications revenues, and that tax rate is \nthen passively \u201cdeemed approved\u201d by the FCC 14 days \nlater, without the FCC ever taking any affirmative \naction or even issuing an approval order. 47 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 54.709(a)(3). There is no evidence the FCC itself \never actually reviews USAC\u2019s work or agrees with \nUSAC\u2019s discretionary decisions about how much \n\n4 \n \nmoney to raise, which is far from a ministerial \nundertaking. \nThis entire process happens only days before the \nnew quarter begins, giving the FCC no real option but \nto accept whatever numbers USAC demands. USAC \nthen collects the forced contributions and chooses how \nto disburse the funds. In essence, a private company \nis taxing Americans in amounts that total billions of \ndollars every year, under penalty of law, without true \ngovernmental accountability. \nThe en banc Fifth Circuit correctly held the USF\u2019s \nrevenue raising is unconstitutional under Article I of \nthe U.S. Constitution. See Pet.App.64a\u201381a. The \ncourt concluded there are \u201cgrave concerns about \n\u00a7 254\u2019s constitutionality under the Supreme Court\u2019s \nnondelegation precedents,\u201d as Congress handed over \nits core legislative taxing power to an agency with \nnothing \nmore \nthan \n\u201c\u2018aspirational\u2019\u201d \nlimits. \nPet.App.28a\u201329a, 42a. The Fifth Circuit also had \n\u201cserious trouble squaring FCC\u2019s subdelegation [to \nUSAC] with Article I, \u00a7 1 of the Constitution.\u201d \nPet.App.54a\u201355a. \nRather than hold independently unconstitutional \nCongress\u2019s delegation to the FCC and the FCC\u2019s \ndelegation to USAC, the Court concluded that the \ncombination \nwas \nunconstitutional. \n\u201c[T]he \nunprecedented nature of the delegation\u201d of broad \ntaxing power from Congress to the FCC, \u201ccombined \nwith other factors\u201d like the FCC\u2019s subsequent \nredelegation to USAC, was more than \u201cenough to hold \n[the USF] unlawful.\u201d Pet.App.42a. \n\n5 \n \nThe dual layers of delegation\u2014from Congress to \nthe FCC, then from the FCC to USAC\u2014\u201cobscure lines \nof accountability the Framers intended to be clear\u201d \nand \u201crender the promise of recourse to the judiciary \nillusory because they give reviewing courts no \nstandard against which to measure the compatibility \nof executive action with the prescriptions of the \npeople\u2019s elected representatives.\u201d Pet.App.75a. \nThe \nFifth \nCircuit \nconcluded: \n\u201cAmerican \ntelecommunications consumers are subject to a \nmultibillion-dollar tax nobody voted for. The size of \nthat tax is de facto determined by a trade group \nstaffed by industry insiders with no semblance of \naccountability to the public. And the trade group in \nturn relies on projections made by its private, for-\nprofit constituent companies, all of which stand to \nprofit \nfrom \nevery \nsingle \ntax \nincrease. \nThis \ncombination of delegations, subdelegations, and \nobfuscations of the USF Tax mechanism offends \nArticle I, \u00a7 1 of the Constitution.\u201d Pet.App.81a. \nConcurring, several judges would have gone \nfurther, explaining that \u201cCongress\u2019s delegation of \nlegislative power to the FCC and the FCC\u2019s delegation \nof the taxing power to a private entity each \nindividually contravene the separation of powers \nprinciple \nthat \nundergirds \nour \nConstitutional \nRepublic.\u201d Pet.App.82a (Elrod, J., joined by Ho & \nEnglehardt, JJ., concurring) (emphasis added). \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision was unsurprising. \nScholars had long flagged these serious constitutional \nflaws with the USF. \u201cUnlike the thousands of \n\n6 \n \nresponsibilities carried out by governmental agencies \non behalf of Congress, this delegation is unique \nbecause of the unfettered power given to the FCC in \ndefining the scope of universal service, and because \nCongress delegated the power to levy a tax to pay for \nthe service with no limits, knowing that the end user, \nthe American public, would ultimately be saddled \nwith the burden.\u201d Barbara A. Cherry & Donald D. \nNystrom, \nUniversal \nService \nContributions: \nAn \nUnconstitutional Delegation of Taxing Power, 2000 L. \nRev. Mich. St. U. Det. C.L. 107, 110. \nSimilarly, former FCC Commissioner Harold \nFurchtgott-Roth has written that the USF charges are \na \u201chidden tax\u201d where \u201c[t]he FCC, by its own logic, [has] \nas much authority to spend $2.25 trillion as it [has] to \nspend $2.25 billion.\u201d Harold W. Furchtgott-Roth, A \nTough Act to Follow? at 62, 72 (2006). \nThe Challengers consented to the government\u2019s \nrequest to stay the Fifth Circuit\u2019s mandate, on \ncondition that the government file its petition for a \nwrit of certiorari by September 30, 2024. The Fifth \nCircuit granted the government\u2019s request. See Order, \nConsumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, No. 22-60008 (5th Cir. Aug. \n26, 2024), ECF No. 349-2. \nDISCUSSION \nAs noted above, the Challengers filed petitions for \nwrits of certiorari from decisions by the Sixth and \nEleventh Circuits, which rejected the Challengers\u2019 \nnondelegation claims. See Consumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, \nNos. 23-456 & 23-743. The Challengers have sought \n\n7 \n \nrehearing of this Court\u2019s June 2024 denial of those \npetitions. Id. Those rehearing petitions remain \npending. \nGiven their own pending requests for this Court\u2019s \nreview of those adverse rulings, the Challengers agree \nthe constitutionality of the USF funding mechanism \nwarrants this Court\u2019s review. There is also now a \ncircuit split on whether that funding mechanism \nviolates nondelegation principles. \nTime is of the essence because the government \ncontinues to collect funds for the USF despite the \nFifth Circuit\u2019s holding below, as the Fifth Circuit \nagreed to stay its mandate on condition that the \ngovernment file its petition for a writ of certiorari by \nSeptember 30, 2024. See Order, Consumers\u2019 Rsch., No. \n22-60008 (5th Cir. Aug. 26, 2024). \nGiven the time sensitivity, the Court should grant \nthe petitions for rehearing and certiorari in Nos. 23-\n456 and 23-743, which are already fully briefed, and \nthus merits briefing can begin immediately. The \nCourt could then either consolidate all three cases, or \nhold this case pending a decision in Nos. 23-456 and \n23-743. \nThe Court should realign the parties for any \nconsolidated proceedings so the Challengers are \ntreated as petitioners, given that they first sought this \nCourt\u2019s review on these issues and have been \npetitioners in all lower-court proceedings. The Court \nhas previously realigned the parties in cases raising \nthe same issue, consistent with the parties\u2019 status in \n\n8 \n \nthe earlier-filed case. See, e.g., Axon Enter., Inc. v. \nFTC, No. 21-86 & SEC v. Cochran, No. 21-1239 \n(realigned parties so the Government was treated as \nrespondent in both cases); AMG Capital Mgmt., LLC \nv. FTC, No. 19-508 & FTC v. Credit Bureau Ctr., LLC, \nNo. 19-825 (similar). The Court has also previously \ngranted rehearing and then consolidated several \npending cases for merits briefing and argument. See, \ne.g., Al Odah v. United States, No. 06-1196 & \nBoumediene v. Bush, No. 06-1195. \n \n \n\n9 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe petitions for rehearing and for writs of \ncertiorari in Nos. 23-456 and 23-743 should be \ngranted. If the Court grants this case (No. 24-354), \ntoo, it should either hold it pending a decision in Nos. \n23-456 and 23-743, or consolidate the three cases and \nrealign the parties here so the Challengers are treated \nas petitioners. \nROBERT HENNEKE \nCHANCE WELDON \nTEXAS PUBLIC POLICY \nFOUNDATION \n901 Congress Avenue \nAustin, TX 78701 \n(512) 472-2700 \nrhenneke@texaspolicy.com \n \nR.

Congress defined universal service and \nadopted specific, detailed principles to guide and \ncabin the FCC\u2019s exercise of delegated authority. \nSee 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(b), (c), (d), (h).  \nFollowing Congress\u2019s directive in Section 254, the \nFCC has administered the Universal Service Fund \n(\u201cUSF\u201d or the \u201cFund\u201d) for decades, with ministerial \nsupport from the Universal Service Administrative \nCompany (\u201cUSAC\u201d or the \u201cAdministrator\u201d). The \nFCC\u2019s rules limit USAC\u2019s role to administrative \nmatters, \nprohibit \nUSAC \nfrom \nmaking \npolicy \ndecisions, and provide for de novo FCC review of any \nUSAC decision upon request. \nThe questions presented are: \n1. Whether Congress violated the nondelegation \ndoctrine \nby \nauthorizing \nthe \nCommission \nto \ndetermine, within the limits set forth in Section 254, \nthe amount that providers must contribute to the \nFund. \n2. \nWhether \nthe \nCommission \nviolated \nthe \nnondelegation doctrine by using the Administrator\u2019s \nfinancial projections in computing universal service \ncontribution rates. \n3. \nWhether \nthe \ncombination \nof \nCongress\u2019s \nconferral of authority on the Commission and the \nCommission\u2019s \ndelegation \nof \nadministrative \n\nii \n \nresponsibilities to the Administrator violates the \nnondelegation doctrine. \n4. Whether this case is moot in light of the \nchallengers\u2019 failure to seek preliminary relief before \nthe Fifth Circuit. \n\niii \n \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nAND RULE 29.6 STATEMENT \nPetitioners in Case No. 24-354 are the Federal \nCommunications Commission and the United States \nof America. \nPetitioners in Case No. 24-422 are the Schools, \nHealth & Libraries Broadband Coalition (\u201cSHLB \nCoalition\u201d), Benton Institute for Broadband & \nSociety, National Digital Inclusion Alliance, and \nCenter for Media Justice dba MediaJustice, Competi-\ntive \nCarriers \nAssociation, \nNational \nTele-\ncommunications Cooperative Association dba NTCA, \nand USTelecom \u2013 The Broadband Association. \nRespondents in both cases are Consumers\u2019 Re-\nsearch; Cause Based Commerce, Inc.; Kersten Con-\nway; Suzanne Bettac; Robert Kull; Kwang Ja Kirby; \nTom Kirby; Joseph Bayly; Jeremy Roth; Deanna \nRoth; Lynn Gibbs; Paul Gibbs; and Rhonda Thomas. \nThe disclosure statement included in the Petition \nfor Writ of Certiorari in Case No. 24-422 remains ac-\ncurate as to SHLB Coalition, Benton Institute for \nBroadband & Society, National Digital Inclusion \nAlliance, and Center for Media Justice dba Media-\nJustice. \n  \n \n\niv \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nQUESTIONS PRESENTED ....................................... i \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING AND RULE 29.6 \nSTATEMENT ............................................................ iii \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES ....................................... vi \nOPINIONS BELOW .................................................... 1 \nJURISDICTIONAL STATEMENT ............................. 1 \nCONSTITUTIONAL, STATUTORY, AND \nREGULATORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED .............. 1 \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE .................................... 2 \nA.

The FCC\u2019s History of Promoting Universal \nService  \nThe FCC\u2019s history of promoting universal service \nlong predates the Telecommunications Act of 1996 \n(\u201c1996 Act\u201d). Congress created the FCC in the \nCommunications Act of 1934, Pub. L. No. 73-416, 48 \nStat. 1064 (1934) (\u201cthe Act\u201d or \u201cCommunications \nAct\u201d), with a charge to promote universal service\u2014\ni.e., \u201cto make available \u2026 to all the people of the \nUnited States \u2026 a rapid, efficient, Nation-wide, and \nworld-wide \n\u2026 \ncommunication \nservice \n\u2026 \nat \nreasonable charges.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 151. \nIn 1934, \u201cAT&T \u2026 held a virtual monopoly over \nthe Nation\u2019s telephone service.\u201d MCI Telecomms. \nCorp. v. Am. Tel. & Tel. Co., 512 U.S. 218, 220 \n(1994). AT&T\u2019s vertical business model enabled it to \nprovide long-distance telephone service at higher \nrates to help subsidize its subsidiaries\u2019 local service.  \nIn the early 1980s, following antitrust litigation \nresulting from the development of competition in the \nlong-distance market, AT&T was forced to divest its \nlocal telephone subsidiaries. Because AT&T could no \nlonger internally subsidize local service, the FCC \nbegan assessing charges on all interstate long-\ndistance carriers to finance a \u201cUniversal Service \nFund\u201d to support high-cost areas.1 That Fund used \nrevenues from \u201ceasy-to-reach customers, such as city \ndwellers, to implicitly subsidize service to those in \n \n1 See Access Charges; MTS and WATS Market Structure, \n48 Fed. Reg. 10319, \u00b6 123 (Mar. 11, 1983) (\u201c1983 Access \nCharge Order\u201d). \n\n3 \n \nareas that were hard to reach.\u201d AT&T, Inc. v. FCC, \n886 F.3d 1236, 1242 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (citation \nomitted). \nAt that time, the FCC derived the authority to \npromote universal service from several general \nprovisions of the Communications Act. See 1983 \nAccess Charge Order \u00b6\u00b6 36-55, 83; infra p.20 & n.27. \nSee generally Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n Regul. Util. Comm\u2019rs v. \nFCC, 737 F.2d 1095, 1108 n.6 (D.C. Cir. 1984) \n(\u201cNARUC\u201d) (affirming the FCC\u2019s implicit universal \nservice goal and related authority).  \nThe FCC also allowed providers to assess end-\nuser charges.2 Out of concern that these new charges \ncould impact telephone subscribership levels, and \nthus \nundermine \nuniversal \nservice, \nthe \nFCC \nimplemented the Lifeline program to waive the end-\nuser charges for qualifying households.3  \nB. Congress\u2019s Direction to the FCC to Promote \nUniversal Service in the 1996 Act \nIn 1996, Congress adopted fundamental changes \nthat moved away from a monopoly-based system for \nlocal telephone service to a competitive market-\ndriven \napproach. \nBecause \ncompetition \nwas \ninconsistent with the use of implicit subsidies, \nCongress required the FCC to replace its implicit \nsubsidy system with explicit universal service \nmechanisms, as codified in 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254.  \n \n2 1983 Access Charge Order \u00b6 3. \n3 See \nMTS \nand \nWATS \nMarket \nStructure; \nand \nEstablishment of a Joint Board; Amendment, 50 Fed. \nReg. 939 (Jan. 8, 1985); MTS and WATS Market \nStructure, 51 Fed. Reg. 1371 (Jan. 13, 1986). \n\n4 \n \nSection 254 directs the FCC\u2019s implementation of \nuniversal service in numerous ways.  \nUniversal Service Definition. Congress defined \nuniversal \nservice \nas \n\u201can \nevolving \nlevel \nof \ntelecommunications services that the Commission \nshall establish periodically under this section, taking \ninto account advances in telecommunications and \ninformation technologies and services.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(c)(1); see also S. Rep. No. 104-23, at 27 (1995) \n(explaining the intention to \u201censure that the \ndefinition of universal service evolves over time to \nkeep pace with modern life\u201d). Congress authorized \nthe FCC to define the \u201cservices that are supported by \nFederal universal service support mechanisms,\u201d \nrequiring that the FCC \u201cshall consider\u201d the extent to \nwhich the services are \u201cessential to education, public \nhealth, or public safety,\u201d \u201csubscribed to by a \nsubstantial majority of residential customers,\u201d \u201cbeing \ndeployed in public telecommunications networks,\u201d \nand \u201cconsistent with the public interest, convenience, \nand necessity.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(c)(1)(A)-(D). \nPrinciples. Congress required the FCC to base its \nuniversal service policies on six limiting principles. \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(b). The first three principles \nprovided direction for implementation, building on \nthe \nFCC\u2019s \nprior \nuniversal \nservice \ntenets \nof \naffordability and nationwide availability: \n(1) QUALITY \nAND RATES. Quality services \nshould be available at just, reasonable, and \naffordable rates. \n(2) ACCESS TO ADVANCED SERVICES. Access to \nadvanced telecommunications and information \nservices should be provided in all regions of \nthe Nation. \n\n5 \n \n(3) ACCESS IN RURAL AND HIGH COST AREAS. \nConsumers in all regions of the Nation, \nincluding low-income consumers and those in \nrural, insular, and high cost areas, should \nhave \naccess \nto \ntelecommunications \nand \ninformation services \u2026 that are reasonably \ncomparable to those services provided in \nurban areas and that are available at rates \nthat are reasonably comparable \u2026 .  \nId. \u00a7 254(b)(1)-(3). \nThe fourth and fifth enumerated principles \nestablished guidelines for a funding mechanism: \n(4) EQUITABLE \nAND \nNONDISCRIMINATORY \nCONTRIBUTIONS. All providers of telecomm-\nunications services should make an equitable \nand no\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Congress defined universal service and \nadopted specific, detailed principles to guide and \ncabin the FCC\u2019s exercise of delegated authority. \nSee 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(b), (c), (d), (h).  \nFollowing Congress\u2019s directive in Section 254, the \nFCC has administered the Universal Service Fund \n(\u201cUSF\u201d or the \u201cFund\u201d) for decades, with ministerial \nsupport from the Universal Service Administrative \nCompany (\u201cUSAC\u201d or the \u201cAdministrator\u201d). The \nFCC\u2019s rules limit USAC\u2019s role to administrative \nmatters, \nprohibit \nUSAC \nfrom \nmaking \npolicy \ndecisions, and provide for de novo FCC review of any \nUSAC decision upon request. \nThe questions presented are: \n1. Whether Congress violated the nondelegation \ndoctrine \nby \nauthorizing \nthe \nCommission \nto \ndetermine, within the limits set forth in Section 254, \nthe amount that providers must contribute to the \nFund. \n2. \nWhether \nthe \nCommission \nviolated \nthe \nnondelegation doctrine by using the Administrator\u2019s \nfinancial projections in computing universal service \ncontribution rates. \n3. \nWhether \nthe \ncombination \nof \nCongress\u2019s \nconferral of authority on the Commission and the \nCommission\u2019s \ndelegation \nof \nadministrative \n\nii \n \nresponsibilities to the Administrator violates the \nnondelegation doctrine. \n4. Whether this case is moot in light of the \nchallengers\u2019 failure to seek preliminary relief before \nthe Fifth Circuit. \n\niii \n \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nAND RULE 29.6 STATEMENT \nPetitioners in Case No. 24-354 are the Federal \nCommunications Commission and the United States \nof America. \nPetitioners in Case No. 24-422 are the Schools, \nHealth & Libraries Broadband Coalition (\u201cSHLB \nCoalition\u201d), Benton Institute for Broadband & \nSociety, National Digital Inclusion Alliance, and \nCenter for Media Justice dba MediaJustice, Competi-\ntive \nCarriers \nAssociation, \nNational \nTele-\ncommunications Cooperative Association dba NTCA, \nand USTelecom \u2013 The Broadband Association. \nRespondents in both cases are Consumers\u2019 Re-\nsearch; Cause Based Commerce, Inc.; Kersten Con-\nway; Suzanne Bettac; Robert Kull; Kwang Ja Kirby; \nTom Kirby; Joseph Bayly; Jeremy Roth; Deanna \nRoth; Lynn Gibbs; Paul Gibbs; and Rhonda Thomas. \nThe disclosure statement included in the Petition \nfor Writ of Certiorari in Case No. 24-422 remains ac-\ncurate as to SHLB Coalition, Benton Institute for \nBroadband & Society, National Digital Inclusion \nAlliance, and Center for Media Justice dba Media-\nJustice. \n  \n \n\niv \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nQUESTIONS PRESENTED ....................................... i \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING AND RULE 29.6 \nSTATEMENT ............................................................ iii \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES ....................................... vi \nOPINIONS BELOW .................................................... 1 \nJURISDICTIONAL STATEMENT ............................. 1 \nCONSTITUTIONAL, STATUTORY, AND \nREGULATORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED .............. 1 \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE .................................... 2 \nA.

The FCC\u2019s History of Promoting Universal \nService  \nThe FCC\u2019s history of promoting universal service \nlong predates the Telecommunications Act of 1996 \n(\u201c1996 Act\u201d). Congress created the FCC in the \nCommunications Act of 1934, Pub. L. No. 73-416, 48 \nStat. 1064 (1934) (\u201cthe Act\u201d or \u201cCommunications \nAct\u201d), with a charge to promote universal service\u2014\ni.e., \u201cto make available \u2026 to all the people of the \nUnited States \u2026 a rapid, efficient, Nation-wide, and \nworld-wide \n\u2026 \ncommunication \nservice \n\u2026 \nat \nreasonable charges.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 151. \nIn 1934, \u201cAT&T \u2026 held a virtual monopoly over \nthe Nation\u2019s telephone service.\u201d MCI Telecomms. \nCorp. v. Am. Tel. & Tel. Co., 512 U.S. 218, 220 \n(1994). AT&T\u2019s vertical business model enabled it to \nprovide long-distance telephone service at higher \nrates to help subsidize its subsidiaries\u2019 local service.  \nIn the early 1980s, following antitrust litigation \nresulting from the development of competition in the \nlong-distance market, AT&T was forced to divest its \nlocal telephone subsidiaries. Because AT&T could no \nlonger internally subsidize local service, the FCC \nbegan assessing charges on all interstate long-\ndistance carriers to finance a \u201cUniversal Service \nFund\u201d to support high-cost areas.1 That Fund used \nrevenues from \u201ceasy-to-reach customers, such as city \ndwellers, to implicitly subsidize service to those in \n \n1 See Access Charges; MTS and WATS Market Structure, \n48 Fed. Reg. 10319, \u00b6 123 (Mar. 11, 1983) (\u201c1983 Access \nCharge Order\u201d). \n\n3 \n \nareas that were hard to reach.\u201d AT&T, Inc. v. FCC, \n886 F.3d 1236, 1242 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (citation \nomitted). \nAt that time, the FCC derived the authority to \npromote universal service from several general \nprovisions of the Communications Act. See 1983 \nAccess Charge Order \u00b6\u00b6 36-55, 83; infra p.20 & n.27. \nSee generally Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n Regul. Util. Comm\u2019rs v. \nFCC, 737 F.2d 1095, 1108 n.6 (D.C. Cir. 1984) \n(\u201cNARUC\u201d) (affirming the FCC\u2019s implicit universal \nservice goal and related authority).  \nThe FCC also allowed providers to assess end-\nuser charges.2 Out of concern that these new charges \ncould impact telephone subscribership levels, and \nthus \nundermine \nuniversal \nservice, \nthe \nFCC \nimplemented the Lifeline program to waive the end-\nuser charges for qualifying households.3  \nB. Congress\u2019s Direction to the FCC to Promote \nUniversal Service in the 1996 Act \nIn 1996, Congress adopted fundamental changes \nthat moved away from a monopoly-based system for \nlocal telephone service to a competitive market-\ndriven \napproach. \nBecause \ncompetition \nwas \ninconsistent with the use of implicit subsidies, \nCongress required the FCC to replace its implicit \nsubsidy system with explicit universal service \nmechanisms, as codified in 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254.  \n \n2 1983 Access Charge Order \u00b6 3. \n3 See \nMTS \nand \nWATS \nMarket \nStructure; \nand \nEstablishment of a Joint Board; Amendment, 50 Fed. \nReg. 939 (Jan. 8, 1985); MTS and WATS Market \nStructure, 51 Fed. Reg. 1371 (Jan. 13, 1986). \n\n4 \n \nSection 254 directs the FCC\u2019s implementation of \nuniversal service in numerous ways.  \nUniversal Service Definition. Congress defined \nuniversal \nservice \nas \n\u201can \nevolving \nlevel \nof \ntelecommunications services that the Commission \nshall establish periodically under this section, taking \ninto account advances in telecommunications and \ninformation technologies and services.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(c)(1); see also S. Rep. No. 104-23, at 27 (1995) \n(explaining the intention to \u201censure that the \ndefinition of universal service evolves over time to \nkeep pace with modern life\u201d). Congress authorized \nthe FCC to define the \u201cservices that are supported by \nFederal universal service support mechanisms,\u201d \nrequiring that the FCC \u201cshall consider\u201d the extent to \nwhich the services are \u201cessential to education, public \nhealth, or public safety,\u201d \u201csubscribed to by a \nsubstantial majority of residential customers,\u201d \u201cbeing \ndeployed in public telecommunications networks,\u201d \nand \u201cconsistent with the public interest, convenience, \nand necessity.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(c)(1)(A)-(D). \nPrinciples. Congress required the FCC to base its \nuniversal service policies on six limiting principles. \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(b). The first three principles \nprovided direction for implementation, building on \nthe \nFCC\u2019s \nprior \nuniversal \nservice \ntenets \nof \naffordability and nationwide availability: \n(1) QUALITY \nAND RATES. Quality services \nshould be available at just, reasonable, and \naffordable rates. \n(2) ACCESS TO ADVANCED SERVICES. Access to \nadvanced telecommunications and information \nservices should be provided in all regions of \nthe Nation. \n\n5 \n \n(3) ACCESS IN RURAL AND HIGH COST AREAS. \nConsumers in all regions of the Nation, \nincluding low-income consumers and those in \nrural, insular, and high cost areas, should \nhave \naccess \nto \ntelecommunications \nand \ninformation services \u2026 that are reasonably \ncomparable to those services provided in \nurban areas and that are available at rates \nthat are reasonably comparable \u2026 .  \nId. \u00a7 254(b)(1)-(3). \nThe fourth and fifth enumerated principles \nestablished guidelines for a funding mechanism: \n(4) EQUITABLE \nAND \nNONDISCRIMINATORY \nCONTRIBUTIONS. All providers of telecomm-\nunications services should make an equitable \nand nondiscriminatory contribution to the \npreservation and advancement of universal \nservice. \n(5) SPECIFIC \nAND \nPREDICTABLE \nSUPPORT \nMECHANISMS. \nThere \nshould \nbe \nspecific, \npredictable and sufficient Federal and State \nmechanisms \nto \npreserve \nand \nadvance \nuniversal service.  \nId. \u00a7 254(b)(4)-(5). \nIn the last enumerated principle, Congress \nestablished schools, libraries, and rural health care \nproviders as explicit beneficiaries: \n(6) ACCESS \nTO \nADVANCED \nTELECOMM-\nUNICATIONS SERVICES FOR SCHOOLS, HEALTH \nCARE, \nAND \nLIBRARIES. \nElementary \nand \nsecondary schools and classrooms, health care \nproviders, and libraries should have access to \n\n6 \n \nadvanced \ntelecommunications \nservices \nas \ndescribed in subsection (h). \nId. \u00a7 254(b)(6). \nCongress also authorized the FCC to adopt \nadditional principles, subject to the requirements \nthat they \u201care necessary and appropriate for the \nprotection of the public interest, convenience, and \nnecessity and are consistent with this chapter.\u201d Id. \n\u00a7 254(b)(7).  \nFunding Mechanism. Congress established the \nframework for contributions to finance universal \nservice. It required every \u201ccarrier that provides \ninterstate telecommunications service [to] contribute, \non an equitable and nondiscriminatory basis to the \nspecific, predictable, and sufficient mechanisms \nestablished by the Commission to preserve and \nadvance universal service.\u201d Id. \u00a7 254(d). Congress \nspecified that the support be \u201cexplicit and sufficient \nto achieve the purposes\u201d of Section 254. Id. \u00a7 254(e). \nSpecific \nPrograms. \nFor \nthe \nnew \nsupport \nmechanisms for rural health care providers and \nschools and libraries, Congress required that \ntelecommunications carriers provide services at \ndiscounted rates. For rural health care facilities, the \nrate must be \u201creasonably comparable to rates \ncharged for similar services in urban areas in that \nState.\u201d Id. \u00a7 254(h)(1)(A). For \u201celementary schools, \nsecondary schools, and libraries,\u201d Congress directed \nthe Commission to provide a discount compared to \nthe rates for \u201csimilar services to other parties\u201d that \n\u201cthe Commission \u2026 determine[s] is appropriate and \nnecessary to ensure affordable access to and use of \nsuch services by such entities.\u201d Id. \u00a7 254(h)(1)(B).  \n\n7 \n \nOversight. \nCongress \nestablished \nperiodic \nreporting requirements in the 1996 Act and \nsubsequent \nlegislation \nto \noversee \nthe \nFCC\u2019s \nimplementation of Section 254. For example, the \nFCC must conduct an annual inquiry into \u201cthe \navailability \nof \nadvanced \ntelecommunications \ncapability to all Americans\u201d and, if necessary, \u201ctake \nimmediate action to accelerate deployment of such \ncapability.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1302(b). And in 1997, immediately \nafter the FCC issued rules implementing Section \n254, Congress required the FCC to submit a detailed \nreport on who was required to contribute, and who \nwas permitted to receive, universal service funds.4  \nLikewise in 2009, Congress mandated that the \nFCC assess the state of broadband deployment.5 The \nFCC published the National Broadband Plan the \nfollowing year.6 And in 2021, Congress further \nrequired the FCC to provide recommendations for \n\u201cimproving \nits \neffectiveness \nin \nachieving \nthe \nuniversal service goals for broadband,\u201d with a \nlimitation that the recommendations \u201cmay not in any \nway reduce the congressional mandate to achieve the \n \n4 Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the \nJudiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, \n1998, Pub.

To facilitate the FCC\u2019s determination, \nthe Administrator calculates and submits the \nprojected USF support amounts\u2014including \u201cthe \nbasis for those projections\u201d based on the FCC\u2019s \ndetailed rules for the programs\u2014at least sixty \ncalendar days before each quarter as well as its \nprojected administrative expenses. Id. \u00a7 54.709(a)(3); \nsee also Memorandum of Understanding Between the \nFederal \nCommunications \nCommission \nand \nthe \nUniversal Service Administrative Company \u00b6 13 \n(Oct. 17, 2024), https://www.fcc.gov/sites/default/files/\nusac-mou.pdf (\u201cFCC/USAC MOU\u201d). \nContribution Base. Next, at least 30 days before \nthe start of the quarter, the Administrator submits \nthe total \u201ccontribution base\u201d (i.e., providers\u2019 projected \ninterstate and international revenues) to the FCC. \n47 \nC.F.R. \n\u00a7 54.709(a)(3). \nThe \nAdministrator \ndetermines projected revenue based on quarterly \nreports from service providers. Pursuant to the \n\n12 \n \nMemorandum of Understanding between the FCC \nand the Administrator, the FCC\u2019s Office of Managing \nDirector must \u201creview the contribution base and \nprovide any necessary feedback to USAC before \nUSAC publicly files the contribution base with the \nFCC.\u201d FCC/USAC MOU \u00b6 13.  \nContribution Factor. After reviewing the demand \nand \ncontribution \nbase \nprojections \nfrom \nthe \nAdministrator, the FCC\u2014through its Office of \nManaging Director\u2014issues a public notice with a \nproposed contribution factor. \u201cThe Commission \nreserves the right to set projections of demand and \nadministrative expenses at amounts that the \nCommission \ndetermines \nwill \nserve \nthe \npublic \ninterest.\u201d 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.709(a)(3). If the FCC takes \nno further action within 14 days of the public notice, \nthe contribution factor is \u201cdeemed approved.\u201d Id.  \nWhile the contribution factor percentage has \nincreased over time, this increase is primarily due to \na decline in the contribution base (particularly the \nnumber of landline phones) rather than from \nsignificant growth in the Fund programs. Thus, USF \ndisbursements decreased from $8.71 billion in 2012 \nto $8.27 billion in 2020, while the contribution base \ndecreased from $65.9 billion in 2011 to $41.4 billion \nin 2020.19  \n4. The FCC has adjusted the four USF programs \nover time to reflect evolving technologies. The \ngrowing need for broadband support spurred the \nmost comprehensive reform of the USF programs. \nAfter Congress directed the FCC in 2009 to develop a \n \n19 See 2022 Future of USF Report \u00b6\u00b6 91-92. \n\n13 \n \nNational Broadband Plan to ensure every American \nhas \u201caccess to broadband capability,\u201d20 the FCC \nbegan to refocus Fund support from basic landline \nvoice telephone service to broadband deployment.21  \nToday, the High Cost program funds rural \nservices to consumers and businesses in every state \nand territory. Over 8.5 million households subscribe \nto the Lifeline program, including low-income \nhouseholds, Veterans, and people on tribal lands.22 \nFrom 2022 to 2024, over 106,000 schools and 12,500 \nlibraries received funding from the E-Rate program, \nbenefiting over 54 million students.23 From 2021 to \n2023, over 16,000 health care providers received \nfunding from the Rural Health Care program.24  \nD. This Litigation \nIn 2021, Respondents began challenging each \nsuccessive FCC quarterly contribution factor in the \nfederal courts of appeals. Respondents contended \nthat (1) Congress violated the nondelegation doctrine \nin granting the FCC authority regarding the \ncollection of contributions in support of universal \nservice in Section 254; and (2) the FCC violated the \nprivate nondelegation doctrine by relying on the \n \n20 2009 Recovery Act \u00a7 6001(k)(2). \n21 See, e.g., Connect America Fund, et al., 26 FCC Rcd. \n17663, \u00b6 115 (2011) (\u201c2011 USF Transformation Order\u201d). \n22 Program \nData: \nLifeline \nParticipation, \nUSAC, \nhttps://www.usac.org/lifeline/resources/program-data/ \n(last accessed Jan. 7, 2025) (figures from \u201cLifeline \nParticipation Rate\u201d Excel file). \n23 FCC, The Universal Service Fund: How It Impacts the \nUnited States, at 1 (2024). \n24 Id. \n\n14 \n \nAdministrator to calculate the projected demand and \ncontribution base that inform the FCC\u2019s quarterly \ncontribution factor. The Sixth and Eleventh Circuits \nrejected those challenges. See Pet. App. 14a, 127a; \nConsumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, 67 F.4th 773, 778 (6th Cir. \n2023), cert. denied, 144 S.

The panel \nreasoned that Section 254(b) \u201cexpressly requires\u201d the \nFCC to ensure compliance with the enumerated \nprinciples, and Congress therefore \u201cprovided ample \ndirection.\u201d Pet. App. 133a. The Fifth Circuit panel \nalso \nconcluded \nthat \nthere \nwas \nno \nprivate \nnondelegation violation because the Administrator \ncannot make policy, lacks rulemaking power, and \ncompletes all of its functions subject to FCC \nsupervision and review. See id. at 139a-40a. \nThe en banc Fifth Circuit, in a 9-7 vote, granted \nRespondents\u2019 petition for review.

It declined to reach that issue, however, \nconcluding that the challenge was justiciable \n\u201cbecause it is capable of repetition yet evading \nreview.\u201d Id. \nOn the merits, the court held the First Quarter \n2022 contribution factor unconstitutional.25 First, the \n \n25 The Fifth Circuit stayed the issuance of its mandate \npending this Court\u2019s disposition of a petition for a writ of \ncertiorari.

Aug. 26, 2024). \n\n15 \n \ncourt concluded that USF contributions were a tax, \nnot a fee, and that Congress therefore delegated its \npower to tax\u2014a \u201ccore legislative power\u201d\u2014to the FCC. \nPet. App. 23a-24a. The court nevertheless recognized \nthat delegations by Congress to agencies are \npermissible so long as Congress provides an \nintelligible principle to guide the exercise of \ndelegated authority. See id. at 24a-25a. It further \nrecognized that this Court \u201chas not in the past \nseveral decades held that Congress failed to provide \na requisite intelligible principle.\u201d Id. at 25a-26a \n(quoting Jarkesy v. SEC, 34 F.4th 446, 462 (5th Cir. \n2022)). The Fifth Circuit did not conclude that \nSection 254 violated the nondelegation doctrine \nunder this Court\u2019s precedents. Instead, it expressed \n\u201cgrave concerns about \u00a7 254\u2019s constitutionality.\u201d Id. \nat 42a. \nAs \nto \nRespondents\u2019 \nprivate \nnondelegation \nchallenge, the Fifth Circuit found that the FCC\u2019s \nreliance on the Administrator was problematic for \ntwo reasons. It first stated that FCC regulations \npermit the Administrator\u2019s projections to take effect \n\u201cwithout formal FCC approval.\u201d Pet. App. 49a. It \nthen stated that the FCC has \u201cde facto abdicat[ed]\u201d \nits duty to supervise the Administrator. Id. at 50a. \nHowever, \nthe \nFifth \nCircuit \nstopped \nshort \nof \nconcluding \nthat \nthe \nFCC\u2019s \nreliance \non \nthe \nAdministrator was itself unconstitutional. See id. at \n55a. \nInstead, the court determined that it \u201cneed not \nresolve either question in this case \u2026 because the \ncombination of Congress\u2019s sweeping delegation to \nFCC and FCC\u2019s unauthorized subdelegation to USAC \nviolates the Legislative Vesting Clause in Article I, \n\u00a7 1.\u201d Id. at 64a. The Fifth Circuit read this Court\u2019s \n\n16 \n \nopinions in Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company \nAccounting Oversight Board, 561 U.S. 477 (2010), \nand Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau, 591 U.S. 197 (2020), to stand for \u201ca general \nprinciple that \u2026 two constitutional parts do not \nnecessarily add up to a constitutional whole.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 66a-67a. Reviewing Congress\u2019s delegation to the \nFCC and the Administrator\u2019s role through this lens, \nthe court concluded that the \u201ccombination of \ndelegations, subdelegations, and obfuscations of the \nUSF Tax mechanism offends Article I, \u00a7 1 of the \nConstitution.\u201d Id. at 81a. \nJudge \nStewart, \nwriting \nfor \nseven \njudges, \ndissented and argued that Section 254 provides an \nintelligible principle, imposing on the FCC \u201ca duty to \nweigh the enumerated universal service principles.\u201d \nId. at 92a. The dissent also noted that Sections \n254(c) and (e) limit the FCC\u2019s discretion as to the \neligible recipients and services. See id. at 93a-96a. \nThese factors \u201csatisfie[d] the intelligible principle \ntest as articulated by the Supreme Court.\u201d Id. at 96a. \nAs to the private nondelegation doctrine, the \ndissent explained that the Administrator\u2019s authority \nis limited to billing, collection, and distribution of \ncontributions, as well as collecting information from \ncontributors to calculate inputs for the FCC\u2019s \ncontribution-factor determination, applying formulas \nthat the FCC provides. See id. at 99a. Finally, the \ndissent highlighted that the FCC\u2019s control over the \nAdministrator is evident in regulations barring the \nlatter from making policy, interpreting rules, or \nissuing anything that has the force of law. Id. at \n100a. \nIn a second dissent, Judge Higginson, writing for \nfive judges, disagreed with the majority\u2019s \u201cnovel \n\n17 \n \ntheory\u201d of nondelegation. Id. at 115a. He explained \nthat this Court had previously considered cases that \nraised \nboth \npublic \nand \nprivate \nnondelegation \nchallenges, but \u201cnever instructed \u2026 that a different \nstandard applies\u201d in cases involving both issues. Id. \nat 116a (citing Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U.S. \n238, 311 (1936); Currin v. Wallace, 306 U.S. 1, 15-16 \n(1939); Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v. Adkins, 310 \nU.S. 381, 399 (1940)). \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n1. This case is not moot because it falls within the \n\u201ccapable of repetition yet evading review\u201d principle. \n2. In Section 254, Congress provided ample \ndirection to the Commission. This Court has never \napplied the nondelegation rule to strike down a \nstatute that provides intelligible principles as clear \nas those Congress provided here. Indeed, it has \napproved delegations that are far less detailed. \nMoreover, because Congress made the key policy \ndecisions, while instructing the FCC to engage in the \nkind of context-specific fact-finding that is not \ncontroversial under the nondelegation doctrine, the \nstatute \nsatisfies \nany \nreasonable \nalternative \nnondelegation test. See Gundy v. United States, 588 \nU.S. 128, 158 (2019) (Gorsuch, J., dissenting).  \n3. The Fifth Circuit significantly exaggerated the \nscope of the Administrator\u2019s responsibilities. In fact, \nthe FCC relies upon the Administrator only for \nministerial duties and retains control over all of the \nAdministrator\u2019s \nactions. \nIn \nparticular, \nthe \nAdministrator\u2019s role in connection with the FCC\u2019s \nadoption of the quarterly contribution factor is to \ncollect data and make projections pursuant to \ndetailed FCC rules. It would be surprising if the \n\n18 \n \nCommission needed to revise the Administrator\u2019s \nprojections frequently. \n4. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s \u201ccombination\u201d approach fails \nhere, where both Congress\u2019s delegation and the \nFCC\u2019s reliance on the Administrator raise no serious \nconstitutional issue. In addition, no precedent \nsupports the use of a combination approach outside \nthe removal context.  \nMoreover, the reasoning of Free Enterprise Fund \nis inapplicable to nondelegation cases. In that case, \nthe Court identified a structural problem: the \ncombination of tenure protection at two levels meant \nthat \u201c[n]either the President \u2026 nor even an officer \nwhose conduct he may review only for good cause, \nha[d] full control over\u201d the entity at issue in that \ncase. 561 U.S. at 496. In contrast, the FCC has full \nauthority \nto \ncontrol \nthe \nAdministrator, \neven \nassuming (contrary to fact) that it is not adequately \nsupervising that entity under current rules. There is \nthus no structural problem analogous to the problem \nthe Court identified in Free Enterprise Fund.  \nARGUMENT \nI. This Case Is Not Moot. \nThe Fifth Circuit correctly found the injury \nalleged by the petitioners in that court capable of \nrepetition yet evading review. Pet. App. 13a. The \nFCC adopts the contribution factor each quarter, and \nthe three months during which the contribution \nmust be paid is too little time for \u201cconsidered plenary \nreview in this Court.\u201d Neb. Press Ass\u2019n v. Stuart, 427 \nU.S. 539, 547 (1976). \nThis Court has never held that a challenger must \nexhaust every potential avenue for preliminary relief \n\n19 \n \nfor this exception to mootness to apply. And while \nsome courts have denied application of the exception \nwhere a challenger\u2019s \u201cprocedural missteps \u2026 prevent \njudicial review,\u201d Protestant Mem\u2019l Med. Ctr., Inc. v. \nMaram, 471 F.3d 724, 731 (7th Cir. 2006), this is not \nsuch a case. The challengers filed their petition for \nreview promptly after the FCC adopted the First \nQuarter 2022 contribution factor. The FCC collects \ncontributions on a monthly basis,26 and those \ncollections are used for ongoing Fund operations, \nincluding disbursements to recipients of Fund \nsupport. In this context, mandating that a challenger \nseek a stay of the contribution factor to bring any \nchallenge would be extremely disruptive given the \ngrave harm that could ensue for other stakeholders. \nParticularly here, where there is no dispute that the \nobligation to contribute recurs on a clear, periodic \nbasis (as it has for many years), there is no benefit to \ndenying application of this mootness exception.  \nIf the Court does find the case moot, it should \nvacate the judgment below under its \u201cwell settled\u201d \nMunsingwear practice. Acheson Hotels, LLC v. \nLaufer, 601 U.S. 1, 5 (2023); see United States v. \nMunsingwear, Inc., 340 U.S. 36 (1950). If the case is \nmoot, it occurred before the Fifth Circuit decision, \nand that decision should not be binding in that \ncircuit.  \n \n26 See, e.g., How to Pay, USAC, https://www.usac.org/\nservice-providers/making-payments/how-to-pay/ (last upd-\nated Oct. 2024) (\u201cUSF payments are due on the 15th of \neach month.\u201d). \n\n20 \n \nII. Congress Provided Ample Direction to the \nFCC Regarding the Universal Service Fund.  \nSection 254 passes muster under any plausible \nunderstanding of the limits the Constitution places \non delegation to agencies.  \nA. Section 254 Provides Extensive Guidance \nto the FCC. \nWhen Congress adopted Section 254 in 1996, it \nwas well aware that the FCC had previously created \nhigh-cost and lifeline programs, relying in part on \nCongress\u2019s direction that the Commission \u201cmake \navailable, so far as possible, to all the people of the \nUnited States \u2026 a rapid, efficient, Nation-wide, and \nworld-wide wire and radio communications service \nwith adequate facilities at reasonable charges,\u201d 47 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 151.27 Congress also recognized that the \npre-1996 Act universal service regime relied on \nimplicit subsidies under which some customers paid \nhigher fees to keep rates affordable for other, lower-\nincome and higher-cost consumers.  \nBecause implicit subsidies cannot survive in a \ncompetitive environment, Congress in the 1996 Act \ndirected the FCC to move to an explicit subsidy \nregime. See 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(e). And, to create the \nnecessary parameters for such a new regime, \n \n27 See also 1997 Universal Service Order \u00b6 329 (citing 47 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151, 154(i), 201, and 205 in summarizing pre-\n1996 Act authority); see NARUC, 737 F.2d at 1108 n.6 \n(rejecting argument that FCC had no authority over \nuniversal service because, in 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 151, \u201cCongress \ndirected that, \u2018so far as possible, ... all people of the \nUnited States\u2019 are to have adequate telephone facilities at \nreasonable prices\u201d). \n\n21 \n \nSection 254 provided significantly more statutory \ndirection as to the key inputs that determine the size \nof the universal service fund and thus the amount of \nthe quarterly contribution factor.  \nCongress specified the entities that must pay into \nthe regime: \u201cEvery telecommunications carrier that \nprovides interstate telecommunications services\u201d \nmust contribute toward the universal service \nmechanisms created under the statute. Id. \u00a7 254(d).28 \nCongress further provided that those payments must \nbe \u201cequitable and nondiscriminatory.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(d).  \nCongress \nlikewise \nconstrained \nthe \nFCC\u2019s \nauthority as to the services that could be part of the \n\u201cuniversal service\u201d program. While giving the FCC \nthe authority to determine the \u201cevolving level\u201d of \nservices that should be covered, Congress generally \nlimited \nthe \nagency \nto \nsupporting \n\u201ctelecomm-\nunications services\u201d\u2014a statutorily defined term that \ninvolves common carriage29\u2014as well as other \n \n28 Congress allowed the FCC to expand this class to \ninclude \u201cproviders of interstate telecommunications\u201d if it \nmade an appropriate public interest finding.

See id. \u00a7 254(c)(3); Tex. Off. of Pub. Util. \nCouns. v.

A number of \nthese principles are especially relevant to limiting \nthe size of the universal service fund, and thus the \namount of the quarterly contribution factor. The \nrequirement in Section 254(b)(1) that quality service \nremain \u201caffordable\u201d32 is significant because, as the \nFCC has explained, \u201cif the universal service burden \nis too high, the affordability of service will be placed \nin jeopardy, undermining the very purpose of the \nuniversal service program.\u201d33  \nLikewise, the principle enunciated in Section \n254(b)(5) (and Section 254(d)) that USF mechanisms \nbe not only \u201cspecific\u201d and \u201cpredictable,\u201d but also \n\u201csufficient\u201d imposes an obligation to ensure that the \nFund is large enough, but not too large, to achieve \nthe statutory goals. Addressing judicial decisions \ndiscussing the text of Section 254, the FCC thus \ndefined the term to mean \u201can affordable and \nsustainable amount of support that is adequate, but \n \n32 See also 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(i) (\u201cThe Commission \u2026 should \nensure that universal service is available at rates that are \njust, reasonable, and affordable.\u201d). \n33 Lifeline and Link Up Reform and Modernization, et al., \n27 \nFCC \nRcd. \n6656, \n\u00b6 37 \n(2012) \n(\u201c2012 \nLifeline \nModernization Order\u201d).  \n\n24 \n \nno greater than necessary, to achieve the goals of the \nuniversal service program.\u201d34 The Fifth Circuit itself \nhas read this language to confirm that \u201cexcessive \nfunding \nmay \nitself \nviolate \nthe \nsufficiency \nrequirements.\u201d Alenco Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v. FCC, 201 \nF.3d 608, 620 (5th Cir. 2000).  \nSection \n254, \nmoreover, \nprovides \nadditional \nspecific guidance as to the amount that universal \nservice subsidies should reduce end-user rates, again \nlimiting the potential size of the universal service \nfund. Supported services for consumers in high-cost \nareas and low-income consumers should be \u201cat rates \nthat are reasonably comparable to rates charged for \nsimilar service in urban areas.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(b)(3). \nRural health care providers should be served at rates \n\u201creasonably comparable\u201d to those for similar services \nin urban areas in the same state.

For instance, the FCC has established \nannual monetary caps for the USF programs to fulfill \nits \u201cstatutory obligation to create a specific, \npredictable, and sufficient universal service support \nmechanism.\u201d37 Likewise, the FCC declined to extend \nsupport to rural home care providers, explaining that \nSection 254(h) limited support to statutorily defined \nhealth care providers.38 Similarly, just last year, the \nFCC rejected calls for it to support certain broadband \nwireless technologies because, as it explained, it \n\u201cremain[s] focused on the statutory obligation to \nestablish rules that enhance access to the extent it is \n\u2018economically reasonable.\u2019\u201d39  \nMoreover, \ncontrary \nto \nthe \nFifth \nCircuit\u2019s \nsuggestion that Section 254 is so lacking in guidance \nthat \u201cno reviewing court could ever possibly \ninvalidate any FCC action,\u201d Pet.

See, e.g., \n \n36 IIJA \u00a7 60104(c)(1)-(3). \n37 1997 Universal Service Order \u00b6 529 (establishing initial \ncap for the E-Rate program); id. \u00b6 705 (establishing initial \ncap for the Rural Health Care program). \n38 Id. \u00b6 656. \n39 Addressing the Homework Gap Through the E-Rate \nProgram, FCC 24-76, WC Docket No. 21-31, \u00b6 25 \n(rel.

That decision reinforces the importance of the \nstatutory guardrails that courts can and do impose \nby enforcing the extensive prescriptive language of \nSection 254.

See Gundy, 588 U.S. at 167 (Gorsuch, J., \ndissenting) (\u201cwe apply the major questions doctrine \nin service of\u201d nondelegation principles).  \n\n27 \n \nB. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s Contrary Assessment \nof Section 254 Disregards the Significant \nConstraints on FCC Discretion. \nThe Fifth Circuit majority\u2019s contrary analysis of \nSection 254 is inconsistent with the statute\u2019s text \nand surrounding context.  \nTo begin, the Fifth Circuit suggests that \nSection 254\u2019s definition of \u201cuniversal service\u201d is not \n\u201cmeaningful\u201d because the concept of \u201cuniversal \nservice\u201d \nis \nnot \n\u201csufficiently \nintelligible.\u201d \nPet. \nApp. 26a. But the statutory text belies that \nconclusion. As noted above, Congress defined \nuniversal service to be an evolving level of \n\u201ctelecommunications services,\u201d which is a defined \nterm, see 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 153(53), and the statute \ngenerally authorizes support only for those services \nand other services such as broadband that use the \nsupported \nfacilities. \nSee \nid. \n\u00a7 254(e); \nsupra \npp.21-22.40 \nIn \naddition, \nSection 254(c) \nspecifies \nnearly \nmathematical criteria for FCC use in determining \nwhether a particular service qualifies for universal \nservice support. As noted, those criteria include \nwhether the service is subscribed to \u201cby a substantial \nmajority of residential customers\u201d and is \u201cbeing \ndeployed in public telecommunications networks by \ntelecommunications \ncarriers.\u201d \n47 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(c)(1)(B)-(C).  \n \n40 As noted above, Section 254(c) authorizes the FCC to \nprovide additional support for schools, libraries, and \nhealth care providers, but only where that is consistent \nwith the policies in Section 254(h). See supra n.31. \n\n28 \n \nSection 254(c) further mandates that the FCC \nconsider whether a particular service is \u201cessential to \neducation, \npublic \nhealth, \nor \npublic \nsafety.\u201d \nId. \u00a7 254(c)(1)(A). \nAlthough \nthe \nFifth \nCircuit \nsuggested without explanation that \u201cessential\u201d is not \na meaningful direction, Pet. App. 29a, that is a \ncommon word that can be readily understood in \naccordance with its plain meaning. See American \nHeritage Dictionary (5th ed. 2022) (\u201c1. Constituting \nor being part of the nature or essence of something; \ninherent \n\u2026 \n2. Fundamentally \nimportant \nor \nnecessary \u2026 .\u201d). The FCC thus readily applied that \nterm in 1997 in establishing nine core services \nsupported \nby \nthe \nfederal \nuniversal \nservice \nmechanisms.41 For instance, the FCC concluded that \nsingle-party service was \u201cessential to public health \nand safety in that it allows residential consumers \naccess to emergency services without delay.\u201d42  \nBeyond that, as discussed above and as the Fifth \nCircuit previously explained, the fact that support \nshould be \u201csufficient\u201d to preserve and advance \nuniversal service itself limits the Fund to enough \nsupport, but not too much, to achieve Congress\u2019s \nobjectives. See supra pp.23-24. Although, as the Fifth \nCircuit noted, that requirement may not mandate \nsupport that precisely \u201c\u2018equal[s] the actual costs \nincurred\u2019\u201d by each carrier, Pet. App. 27a (quoting \nTOPUC I, 183 F.3d at 412), that is far from failing to \nprovide any meaningful limitation on FCC action. \nIndeed, in the portion of TOPUC I the circuit court \nmajority cited, the Fifth Circuit noted that, as used \nin Section 254, \u201csufficiency\u201d was a \u201cdirect statutory \n \n41 See 1997 Universal Service Order \u00b6\u00b6 61-83. \n42 Id. \u00b6 62. \n\n29 \n \ncommand.\u201d Id. at 95a. And in that case, the Fifth \nCircuit approved the FCC\u2019s use of \u201cforward-looking \ncosts\u201d rather than historical costs, which reduces the \namount of support carriers receive and the size of the \nFund. See 183 F.3d at 411; see also Verizon \nCommc\u2019ns v. FCC, 535 U.S. 467, 475 (2002) \n(affirming the FCC\u2019s reliance on forward-looking \ncosts to set just and reasonable rates under 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 252(d)(1), which was also part of the 1996 Act).  \nSimilarly, the specific principles that Congress \nrequired the FCC to \u201cbase\u201d its \u201cpolicies\u201d on in \nSection 254(b) cannot be disregarded on the basis \nthat they are \u201caspirational.\u201d Pet. App. 28a. While it \nis undoubtedly the case that those principles cannot \n\u201coverrid[e] other portions of the Act,\u201d TOPUC I, 183 \nF.3d at 421, the FCC in fact \u201cmust work to achieve \neach one unless there is a direct conflict between it \nand either another listed principle or some other \nobligation or limitation on the FCC\u2019s authority.\u201d \nQwest, 258 F.3d at 1199.  \nTo be sure, as the Fifth Circuit noted (Pet. App. \n28a), the FCC has authority to adopt additional \nprinciples. Those principles themselves, however, \nmust \nbe \n\u201cnecessary \nand appropriate \nfor \nthe \nprotection of the public interest\u201d and \u201cconsistent with \nthis chapter,\u201d which includes all the limitations \ndiscussed above. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(b)(7). Accordingly, \nin nearly three decades, the FCC has adopted only \ntwo \nsuch \nprinciples\u2014advancing \ncompetitive \nneutrality and using universal service funds to \nsupport advanced services\u2014both of which the FCC \nadopted because they are deeply grounded in the text \n\n30 \n \nof the statute.43 No party has challenged the FCC\u2019s \njudgments on those points in this case. \nSection 254 plainly does not permit the FCC to \nuse the Fund \u201cto create an endowment \u2026 to fund \nwhatever projects it might like.\u201d Pet App. 27a. \nCarriers may use universal service funding \u201conly for \nthe provision, maintenance, and upgrading of \nfacilities and services for which the support is \nintended.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(e). And as discussed, \nSection 254 limits which services qualify as part of \n\u201cuniversal service.\u201d See 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(c). \nNor is there significant ambiguity regarding \n\u201cwhich \nschools \nand \nlibraries \nshould \nreceive \nsubsidized services.\u201d Pet. App. 29a. The statute \nmakes clear that all schools and libraries that are \neligible and that meet the statutory definition should \nreceive subsidized service. Section 254(h)(1)(B) states \nthat \u201c[a]ll telecommunications carriers\u201d receiving a \n\u201cbona fide\u201d request from \u201celementary schools, \nsecondary schools, and libraries,\u201d \u201cshall\u201d provide the \nrelevant \nsupported \nservices \nat \nthe \nrelevant \ndiscounted rate. (emphases added). See also 47 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 254(h)(4), (h)(7)(A) (defining elementary and \nsecondary school and providing criteria for school \nand library eligibility).  \nNor was the Fifth Circuit correct in suggesting \neither \nthat \n(1) \u201cthe \nonly \nreal \nconstraint\u201d \nis \nSection 254(b)(1)\u2019s reference to rates remaining \n\u201caffordable\u201d or (2) that that term is \u201cno guidance \nwhatsoever.\u201d Pet. App. 30a (internal quotation marks \nomitted). As explained, there are multiple additional \n \n43 See 1997 Universal Service Order \u00b6 43; 2011 USF \nTransformation Order \u00b6\u00b6 10, 44, 64-65. \n\n31 \n \nconstraints on the size of the universal service \ncontribution factor. See supra pp.20-24. Moreover, \nand \ncontrary \nto \nthe \nFifth \nCircuit \nmajority\u2019s \nunderstanding, the word \u201caffordable\u201d is not rendered \nmeaningless when a product is so necessary that \ndemand is \u201cuncommonly inelastic.\u201d Pet. App. 30a. \nThe FCC resolved this precise issue nearly 30 years \nago, concluding that it must \u201cconsider both the \nabsolute and relative components when making the \naffordability determinations required under section \n254.\u201d44 In determining affordability, it thus must \nassess not only rates, but also \u201cnon-rate factors, such \nas consumer income levels, that can be used to assess \nthe financial burden\u201d created by subscribing to a \nparticular service.45   \nC. Section 254 Is Consistent with Precedent \nand Constitutional History and Would \nSatisfy Any Reasonable Nondelegation \nTest. \nPrecedent strongly supports the conclusion that \nSection 254 does not improperly delegate legislative \npower in violation of Article I, Section 1\u2019s Vesting \nClause. That is equally true even under the more \nrestrictive delegation standards advocated by some \nJustices. \n1. \nAlthough \nthe \nVesting \nClause \nprohibits \ndelegating Congress\u2019s unique legislative power to an \nagency, it has long been established that Congress \nmay lawfully delegate \u201cthe authority to make policies \nand rules that implement its statutes.\u201d Loving v. \nUnited States, 517 U.S. 748, 771 (1996). Thus, the \n \n44 1997 Universal Service Order \u00b6 110.  \n45 Id. \n\n32 \n \nCourt has repeatedly held that there is no \nconstitutional issue where Congress identifies an \n\u201c\u2018intelligible principle\u2019 to guide the delegee\u2019s exercise \nof authority.\u201d Gundy, 588 U.S. at 145 (plurality) \n(quoting J.W. Hampton, Jr., & Co. v. United States, \n276 U.S. 394, 409 (1928)). And as the Court has \nexplained in language that is particularly apt for the \nfast-changing world of telecommunications, \u201cin our \nincreasingly complex society, replete with ever \nchanging and more technical problems, Congress \nsimply cannot do its job absent an ability to delegate \npower under broad general directives.\u201d Mistretta v. \nUnited States, 488 U.S. 361, 372 (1989).  \nThe \nCourt\u2019s \napplication \nof \nthat \nprinciple \ndemonstrates that Section 254 is a permissible \ndelegation. The Court, for instance, has upheld the \nFCC\u2019s issuance of regulations governing radio \nlicensing based on the \u201cpublic interest, convenience, \nor necessity.\u201d NBC v. United States, 319 U.S. 190, \n215 (1943) (citing 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 307(a), (d), 309(a), \n310, 312). In so doing, the Court rejected the claim \nthat the \u201cpublic interest\u201d standard is \u201cso vague and \nindefinite\u201d that the \u201cdelegation is unconstitutional,\u201d \nexplaining that \u201c\u2018[t]he purpose of the Act, the \nrequirements it imposes, and the context of the \nprovision\u2019\u201d make the statutory language more than a \n\u201c\u2018mere general reference to public welfare.\u2019\u201d Id. at \n225-26 (quoting Fed. Radio Comm\u2019n v. Nelson Bros. \nBond & Mortg. Co., 289 U.S. 266, 285 (1933)).  \nAs discussed above, the specific directions \nimposed by the text of Section 254 are far more \nreticulated \nand \nprescriptive \nthan \nthe \n\u201cpublic \ninterest\u201d standard upheld in NBC. See NARUC, 737 \nF.2d at 1129. Indeed, as it codified what services \nshould be supported, Congress mandated that the \n\n33 \n \nFCC consider a number of factual considerations in \naddition to the public interest. See 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(c)(1) (FCC \u201cshall consider\u201d what services are \n\u201cessential\u201d to education, health, or safety; are being \n\u201csubscribed \nto \nby \na \nsubstantial \nmajority \nof \nresidential consumers\u201d; and are being \u201cdeployed in \npublic telecommunications networks\u201d). Beyond that, \nCongress provided guidance as to what kinds of \nservices could be supported; which entities should be \nassessed to support those services; how those entities \nshould be assessed; and how much support could be \nrequired, among many other things. See, e.g., id. \n\u00a7 254(d), (e), (h). Unlike the statutory text at issue in \nNBC, \nSection \n254 \nexplicitly \nenumerates \nsix \nprinciples Congress sought to advance. See id. \n\u00a7 254(b). And, as in NBC, these provisions must be \nunderstood in the context of the goals of the 1996 Act \nand the FCC\u2019s history of universal service regulation.  \nNBC is only one of a number of cases to approve \ndelegations through language that is far more \ngeneral than that at issue here. Many of those cases \ninvolve public utility regulations setting rates.

Co. v. \nFCC, 395 U.S. 367, 375-77 (1969). Perhaps for that \nreason, the Fifth Circuit cites no language from NBC \nor any other case invoking such reasoning.  \nThe Fifth Circuit also erred in suggesting that, \nunlike in the many other cases where this Court has \napproved delegations far less constrained than the \none at issue here, the FCC lacks any \u201cspecial agency \nexpertise\u201d \nrelevant \nto \nuniversal \nservice. \nPet. \nApp. 40a. In fact, this Court has for nearly a century \nacknowledged the FCC\u2019s (and its predecessor\u2019s) \nexpertise \nin \nthe \nfast-changing \nworld \nof \ntelecommunications and technology. See Nelson Bros. \nBond & Mortg.

Mid-\nAm. Pipeline Co., 490 U.S. 212, 222-23 (1989). \n2. Section 254 does not raise the same issues \nthat concerned the Justices who dissented in Gundy. \nThe statute in Gundy allowed the Attorney General \nto \n\u201cspecify \nthe \napplicability\u201d \nof \nregistration \nrequirements to sex offenders convicted before the \nstatute\u2019s passage and \u201cprescribe rules.\u201d 588 U.S. at \n151, 177 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting). Justice Gorsuch \nconcluded that the statutory language \u201cgave the \nAttorney General free rein to write the rules for \nvirtually the entire existing sex offender population \nin this country.\u201d Id. at 151. Section 254, as discussed \nabove, bears no resemblance to that kind of \nlanguage.  \nLikewise, \nSection \n254 \nwould \nsatisfy \nthe \nalternative test proposed by Justice Gorsuch in \nGundy. In particular, Congress has \u201cannounced the \ncontrolling general polic[ies]\u201d underlying Section 254. \nId. at 157. Among other things, Congress has: \n\n36 \n \n\u2022 Made the decision to support universal service \nand told the FCC what factors to consider in \ndetermining \nwhich \nparticular \n\u201ctelecomm-\nunications services\u201d and associated facilities to \nsupport. See 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(c)(1), (e).  \n\u2022 Defined which entities must pay fees to \nsupport universal service. See id. \u00a7 254(d).  \n\u2022 Established which entities are eligible to \nreceive universal service support, criteria \nthose entities must meet, and for what \nservices they can use that funding. See id. \n\u00a7\u00a7 214(e), 254(e).  \n\u2022 Adopted a series of principles that the FCC \nmust follow in making decisions under \nSection 254. See id. \u00a7 254(b)(1)-(6). \n\u2022 Created, through those principles and other \nexplicit statutory text, meaningful limits on \nthe extent to which specific services can be \nfunded, thus limiting the size of the fund. \nSee supra pp.21-24.  \nIn all these instances, Congress has \u201cset forth \nstandards \u2018sufficiently definite and precise to enable \nCongress, the courts, and the public to ascertain\u2019 \nwhether Congress\u2019s guidance has been followed.\u201d \nGundy, 588 U.S. at 158 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting) \n(quoting Yakus, 321 U.S. at 426). \nThe decisions left to the FCC are thus reasonably \nunderstood to be authorizations to apply the \nstatutory text and policies to evolving factual \ncircumstances\u2014or, in other words, to \u201c\u2018fill up the \ndetails.\u2019\u201d Id. at 157 (quoting Wayman v. Southard, 23 \nU.S. 1, 43 (1825)); see id. at 158 (agencies permitted \nto engage in \u201cfact-finding\u201d). The FCC determines, for \ninstance, what services have \u201cbeen subscribed to by a \n\n37 \n \nsubstantial majority of residential customers\u201d and \nare \u201cbeing deployed in public telecommunications \nnetworks by telecommunications carriers.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(c)(1)(B)-(C); see, e.g., 1997 Universal Service \nOrder \u00b6 63 (concluding voice service should be \ncovered \u201cconsistent with section 254(c)(1)\u201d); 2012 \nLifeline Modernization Order \u00b6\u00b6 397-98 (declining to \nmake payphones eligible for Lifeline support upon \nfinding that they were not used by a substantial \nmajority of residential consumers).  \nThe \nagency \nlikewise \ndetermines \nwhat \nis \nnecessary for health care providers and those living \nin high-cost areas to have access at rates that are \n\u201creasonably comparable\u201d to access in urban areas, 47 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 254(b)(3), (h)(1)(A), and for schools and \nlibraries to have access at rates \u201cless than the \namounts charged for similar services to other \nparties,\u201d id. \u00a7 254(h)(1)(B). For instance, in the Rural \nHealth Care program, the FCC determines what \nconstitutes sufficient funding by subtracting the \nurban rate in the state from the rural rate for similar \n(i.e., \u201creasonably comparable\u201d) services. See 47 C.F.R. \n\u00a7\u00a7 54.603-605. \nSimilarly, \nthe \nFCC \nfulfills \nits \nstatutory directive in the E-Rate program through its \n\u201clowest corresponding price\u201d rules. See id. \u00a7\u00a7 54.500, \n54.511(b) (prohibiting providers from submitting bids \nhigher than the price charged to non-residential \ncustomers that are similarly situated to the \nparticular school or library \u201cfor similar services\u201d). \nThe fact that the FCC\u2019s granular implementation of \nthe program flows directly from the statutory \ndirectives cannot be squared with the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \nconclusion that Congress left the agency at sea, \nwithout significant guidance. \n\n38 \n \n3. The delegation of authority in Section 254 is \nalso consistent with the practice of the early \nCongresses, \nwhich \nthis \nCourt \nhas \nrepeatedly \nemphasized are a good guide to the original \nunderstanding of the Constitution. See, e.g., Bowsher \nv. Synar, 478 U.S. 714, 723-24 (1986).  \nThe practice of those Congresses demonstrates \nthat the Founders understood that delegations far \nbroader than the one at issue here were consistent \nwith the constitutional structure. For instance, the \nFirst Congress passed a bill to authorize the \nPresident of the Senate, the Chief Justice, the \nSecretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, \nand the Attorney General (or any three of them), to \npurchase an unspecified amount of certain debt \nwith the approbation of the President of the \nUnited States \u2026 in such manner, and under \nsuch regulations as shall appear to them best \ncalculated to fulfill the intent of this act: \nProvided, That the same be made openly, and \nwith due regard to the equal benefit of the \nseveral states \u2026 .  \nAct of Aug. 12, 1790, ch. 47, \u00a7 2, 1 Stat. 186, 186.  \nSimilarly, in 1798, the Fifth Congress\u2014which \nstill included in its ranks many Framers46\u2014adopted \na direct tax to be apportioned among the states. \n \n46 See Nevada Comm\u2019n on Ethics v. Carrigan, 564 U.S. \n117, 122 (2011) (\u201c[e]arly congressional enactments \nprovide contemporaneous and weighty evidence of the \nConstitution\u2019s meaning,\u201d and finding it \u201cdispositive\u201d that \n\u201c[w]ithin 15 years of the founding, both the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate adopted \u2026 rules\u201d akin to \nthose at issue in the case) (cleaned up). \n\n39 \n \nSee Act of July 9, 1798, ch. 70, \u00a7 8, 1 Stat. 580, 585. \nCongress levied the tax, but then allowed tax \ncommissioners to \u201crevise, adjust and vary, the \nvaluations of lands and dwelling-houses in any \nassessment district \u2026 [at] such a rate \u2026 as shall \nappear to be just and equitable: Provided, that the \nrelative valuations of the different lots or tracts of \nland, or dwelling-houses, in the same assessment \ndistrict, shall not be changed or affected.\u201d Id. \u00a7 22, \n1 Stat. at 589. In other words, Congress again \nenacted a delegation far broader than the one at \nissue here: \u201c[F]ederal administrators had the power \nto raise or lower the tax assessments of thousands of \nproperty owners all at once, by any percentage \namount, so long as the change \u2018shall appear to be just \nand equitable.\u2019\u201d Nicholas R.

Rev. 367 (2024). \n\n40 \n \nIII. The FCC Exercises Direction and Control \nOver the Administrator. \nThe Administrator\u2019s role providing ministerial \nsupport to the FCC in managing the Fund is likewise \nwell within the bounds of this Court\u2019s private \nnondelegation \nprecedents. \nThe \nFifth \nCircuit \nmajority\u2019s suggestion to the contrary is based on an \n\u201cexaggerated conception\u201d of the Administrator\u2019s \u201crole \nand discretion.\u201d Pet. App. 103a (Stewart, J., \ndissenting).  \nA. In determining whether a delegation to a \nprivate actor is permissible, this Court has focused \non whether \u201claw-making is \u2026 entrusted to\u201d a private \nactor and whether a private actor \u201cfunction[s] \nsubordinately to\u201d a government actor with the ability \nto exercise \u201cauthority and surveillance\u201d over it. \nSunshine Anthracite, 310 U.S. at 399. In this case, \nthose factors point decisively toward the lawfulness \nof the Commission\u2019s reliance on the Administrator. \nAdditionally, although the Fifth Circuit analyzed \nfactors that go beyond this Court\u2019s precedents, see \nPet. App. 46a-47a, those factors likewise support the \nlawfulness of the Administrator\u2019s ministerial role.  \nMost significantly, responsibility for carrying out \nCongress\u2019s direction in Section 254 is \u201cnot entrusted \nto\u201d the Administrator; rather, the Administrator \nremains subordinate to the FCC in all respects. \nSunshine Anthracite, 310 U.S. at 399; see Pet. \nApp. 46a (agency \u201cmust have final decision-making \nauthority\u201d). The FCC adopts the rules defining the \nscope of the various Fund programs, the eligible \nrecipients consistent with the statute, and the \namounts of the subsidies (including through rules \ngoverning competitive bidding to determine subsidy \namounts for particular recipients). Those rules \n\n41 \n \ninclude \u201celigibility requirements,\u201d \u201ccaps on particular \ntypes of support,\u201d and \u201cprecise formulas for \ncalculating the amount of the subsidy\u201d in particular \nprograms.\u201d FCC Pet. 20 (citing 47 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 54.410, \n54.507, 54.604-606).  \nMoreover, FCC rules explicitly prohibit the \nAdministrator from \u201cmak[ing] policy, interpret[ing] \nunclear provisions of the statute or rules or \ninterpret[ing] the intent of Congress.\u201d 47 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 54.702(c). Where the Administrator is in doubt, it \n\u201cshall seek guidance from the Commission.\u201d Id.  \nRegarding the quarterly contribution factor in \nparticular, the factor \u201cshall be determined by the \nCommission,\u201d \nnot \nthe \nAdministrator. \nId. \n\u00a7 54.709(a)(2) (emphasis added). The FCC rules and \ndecisions regarding the Fund programs provide the \nfoundation each quarter for determining both inputs \ninto the factor: the Fund programs\u2019 needs and the \nassessable contribution base.  \nThe Administrator, by contrast, plays only a \nministerial role. For example, on the demand side, \nthe Administrator prepares the \u201cquarterly projected \ncosts of the universal service support mechanisms\u201d \nand the \u201cprojected expenses for the federal universal \nservice support mechanisms for each quarter.\u201d Id. \n\u00a7 54.709(a)(2), (3). But those projections are no more \nthan calculations based on decisions already made by \nthe FCC, together with information provided by \nprivate parties under the FCC\u2019s rules. In this case, \nfor example, the Administrator determined the \nsupport amounts for the various Fund programs by \nwalking through the FCC rules and associated \ndecisions for each program. See, e.g., J.A. 21-33, 46-\n49. The FCC\u2019s caps and other funding limits further \nfactor into each program\u2019s demand calculation. See, \n\n42 \n \ne.g., id. at 46 (noting FCC \u201ccap for Funding Year \n2021\u201d in Rural Health Care program). \nOn top of that, the \u201c[t]otal projected expenses \u2026 \nfor \neach \nquarter \nmust \nbe \napproved \nby \nthe \nCommission before they are used to calculate the \nquarterly contribution factor,\u201d and the Commission \n\u201creserves the right to set projections of demand and \nadministrative \nexpenses \nat \namounts \nthat \n[it] \ndetermines will serve the public interest.\u201d 47 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 54.709(a)(3). \nLikewise, on the contribution-base side the \nAdministrator \n\u201ccompile[s]\u201d \nthe \n\u201ctotal \nsubject \nrevenues\u201d to which the contribution factor will apply \neach quarter, \u201cbased on information contained in the \nTelecommunications Reporting Worksheets,\u201d the \ncontent of which is in turn mandated by the \nCommission\u2019s own rules. Id. \u00a7 54.709(a)(2); see id. \n\u00a7 54.711(a) (FCC rule requiring that contributors \n\u201ccalculate[] and file[]\u201d their contributions based on \nthis Worksheet as \u201cpublished in the Federal \nRegister\u201d by the FCC). In this case, again, the \nAdministrator\u2019s filing shows that the contribution \nbase \u201cwas derived\u201d from information on \u201cForm 499-Q \nsubmissions\u201d the FCC requires). Pet. App. 158a. See \ngenerally U.S. Gov\u2019t Accountability Off., GAO-24-\n106967, \nAdministration \nof \nUniversal \nService \nPrograms \nIs \nConsistent \nwith \nSelected \nFCC \nRequirements, app. II at 21-22 (2024). \nAdditionally, \nthe \nFCC \nsupervises \nall \nthe \nAdministrator\u2019s functions. Pet. App. 47a. In addition \nto the FCC\u2019s direct role in determining the \ncontribution \nfactor \nand \nreviewing \nthe \nAdministrator\u2019s projections, the FCC regularly \nexercises its authority to review the Administrator\u2019s \nministerial handling of claims for support. See 47 \n\n43 \n \nC.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 54.719 (parties may seek review), 54.723 \n(review of Administrator decisions is de novo). The \nCommission has not hesitated in exercising that \nauthority and issues a monthly document disposing \nof appeals of the Administrator\u2019s actions. In April \n2024, the FCC granted 27 of 53 E-Rate and Rural \nHealth Care appeals. See Streamlined Resolution of \nRequests Related to Actions by the Universal Service \nAdministrative Company, 39 FCC Rcd. 2989, 2992 \nn.12 (2024) (\u201c[c]onsistent with our obligation to \nconduct a de novo review of appeals of decisions \nmade by USAC, we grant this request for review\u201d \nbased on \u201cdisagree[ment] with USAC\u2019s conclusion\u201d); \nsee also Streamlined Resolution of Requests Related \nto Actions by the Universal Service Administrative \nCompany, 34 FCC Rcd. 9870, 9872 n.9 (2019) \n(\u201cdirect[ing] USAC\u201d to review remanded applications \nwithin 90 days); Request for Review of a Decision of \nthe Universal Service Support Mechanism, 23 FCC \nRcd. \n15413, \n15416 \n\u00b6 7 \n(2008) \n(reviewing \nAdministrator decision and granting waiver in order \nto \u201cpromote[] the statutory requirements of section \n254(h)\u201d).

App. 101a. \nOther forms of FCC supervision and control \nabound. See, e.g., 47 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 54.702(g) (annual \nreport from Administrator to FCC and Congress), \n54.702(h) \n(quarterly \nreport \nto \nFCC \n\u201con \nthe \ndisbursement of \u2026 program funds\u201d), 54.702(j) (FCC \nhas \n\u201cfull \naccess \nto \nthe \ndata \ncollected\u201d \nin \nAdministrator\u2019s \nduties), \n54.709(b) \n(FCC \n\u201cmay \ninstruct the Administrator\u201d on how to handle \u201cexcess \ncontributions\u201d beyond steps already provided by \nrule). \n\n44 \n \nB. Contrary to the Fifth Circuit\u2019s understanding, \nthe FCC \u201cactually exercise[s]\u201d its authority each \nquarter to adopt the contribution factor. Pet. \nApp. 47a (emphasis omitted). The Fifth Circuit \nstated that \u201cUSAC\u2019s projections take legal effect \nwithout formal FCC approval,\u201d id. at 49a, but that is \ninconsistent with FCC rules and the actual process \nfor adopting the contribution factor. The FCC\u2019s Office \nof Managing Director\u2014not the Administrator\u2014\nissues the Public Notice announcing the proposed \ncontribution factor, and the absence of any further \naction within fourteen days of the release of that \nPublic Notice means the projections and resulting \ncontribution factor are \u201cdeemed approved by the \nCommission.\u201d 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.709(a)(3). It is thus the \nFCC\u2019s rules that govern approval and modifications.  \nThe Fifth Circuit also stated that the \u201c\u2018approval\u2019 \nprocess for [the Administrator\u2019s] proposals plays out \njust days before the new quarter begins,\u201d leaving the \nFCC \u201cno real choice but to accept [the] proposed \nfigures.\u201d Pet. App. 50a n.17. That, too, is inaccurate. \nThe Administrator must submit its quarterly \nprojections \nof \ndemand \n(including \nprogram \nadministrative expenses) and the \u201cbasis for those \nprojections\u201d to the FCC and its Office of Managing \nDirector \u201cat least sixty (60) calendar days\u201d before the \nstart of each quarter, and must submit the \u201ctotal \ncontribution base ... at least thirty (30) days before.\u201d \n47 \nC.F.R. \n\u00a7 54.709(a)(3). \nIn \naddition, \nthe \nCommission\u2019s Office of Managing Director \u201cshall \nreview\u201d both submissions and provide \u201cany necessary \nfeedback\u201d before either is \u201cpublicly filed with the \nFCC.\u201d FCC/USAC MOU \u00b6 13. And after the \nCommission\u2019s own Office of Managing Director \nreleases the proposed contribution factor, the \nCommission reserves time within which it can revise \n\n45 \n \nthe projected demand and administrative expenses \namounts where necessary to \u201cserve the public \ninterest.\u201d 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.709(a)(3). That the window \nfor this final step is 14 days does not support a \nconclusion that the Commission cannot or does not \nexercise its authority over the Administrator. \nThe Fifth Circuit also stated that the relative \ninfrequency \nwith \nwhich \nthe \nCommission \n\u201csubstantive[ly] \nchange[s]\u201d \nthe \nAdministrator\u2019s \nprojections means that it is a mere rubber stamp. \nPet. App. 50a (emphasis omitted). The legally \nrelevant question is whether the FCC has such \nauthority, not the frequency with which it exercises \nit. See Sunshine Anthracite, 310 U.S. at 399. \nRegardless, as discussed above, the Administrator\u2019s \nprojections are based on extensive FCC rules \ngoverning the various Universal Service Fund \nprograms. See supra pp.11-12. It is unsurprising that \nthe FCC, having established the policies and \ndetermined the amount of necessary revenues and \nthen tasked the Administrator with calculation and \nother \nministerial \ntasks \nto \nimplement \nthose \ndeterminations, does not frequently alter the output \nof that process. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s characterization \nof this system as an unsupervised \u201cblank check\u201d is \nthus incorrect. Pet. App. 53a.  \nIn any event, the government has identified \nmultiple occasions\u2014including before this litigation \nbegan\u2014on \nwhich \nit \nhas \ndeparted \nfrom \nthe \nAdministrator\u2019s \nprojections \nfor \nthe \nquarterly \ncontribution factor. See FCC Pet. 23; Proposed \nFourth Quarter 2023 Universal Service Contribution \nFactor, 38 FCC Rcd. 8362, 8362-63 (2023); Proposed \nThird Quarter 2023 Universal Service Contribution \nFactor, 38 FCC Rcd. 5670, 5670-71 (2023); Revised \n\n46 \n \nSecond Quarter 2003 Universal Service Contribution \nFactor, 18 FCC Rcd. 5097, 5097-98 (2003). The FCC \nhas also discussed its own revisions to the \nmethodology for calculating the contribution factor in \npublic notices for the proposed contribution factor. \nSee, e.g., Proposed First Quarter 2002 Universal \nService Contribution Factor, 16 FCC Rcd. 21334, \n21334 (2001) (FCC \u201creduce[d] the interval between \nthe accrual of revenues and the assessment of \nuniversal service contributions based on those \nrevenues\u201d from 12 months to 6 months). And at \nvarious times, the Commission has \u201cadjust[ed] the \ncontribution factor \u2026 if USAC collect[ed] insufficient \nfunds, or if USAC collect[ed] funds in excess of actual \nexpenses in the prior quarter.\u201d Universal Service \nContribution Methodology; A National Broadband \nPlan for Our Future, 27 FCC Rcd. 5357, \u00b6 351 (2012). \nIn \nmultiple \nways, \nthe \nFCC \nrevises \nthe \nAdministrator\u2019s projections or the contribution factor \nitself. \nThe Fifth Circuit also suggested that the \npossibility that \u201cdisbursements often do not comply \nwith FCC policy\u201d means that the FCC\u2019s role in \ndefining the rules and scope of Fund programs \u201cdoes \nnothing to limit the revenue FCC allows private \nentities to exact from consumers.\u201d Pet. App. 51a. \nThere is no basis in this Court\u2019s precedent for such a \nstandard\u2014an improper payment does not give rise to \na private nondelegation doctrine issue. See id. \nat 122a (Higginson, J., dissenting) (waste and fraud \nhave \u201cnever been enough to declare a coequal \nbranch\u2019s act unconstitutional\u201d). In any event, as \ndiscussed above, the FCC\u2019s rules for Fund programs \nprovide significant oversight into the relevant \naspects of how recipients spend Fund support. See, \ne.g., 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.622 (extensive rules regarding the \n\n47 \n \ncompetitive bidding process Rural Health Care \nprogram participants must undertake to request \nservices and select a provider); id. \u00a7\u00a7 54.801-806 \n(rules \nregarding \ncompetitive \nbidding, \ncoverage \nobligations, reporting requirements, and more for \nRural Digital Opportunity Fund in High Cost \nprogram). The Administrator\u2019s work also is subject to \nindependent audit (with the participation of the \nFCC\u2019s Office of Managing Director). See id. \u00a7 54.717. \nC. The Fifth Circuit also stated that Section 254 \n\u201cdoes not authorize\u201d the role the FCC has assigned to \nthe Administrator. Pet. App. 55a. It acknowledged, \nhowever, that the challengers did not bring a \nstatutory claim. Id. at 63a & n.21. It also recognized \nthat its concerns regarding statutory authorization \ndo not apply to delegations of \u201cministerial tasks.\u201d \nId. at 56a-58a. \nAs \ndiscussed \nabove, \nthe \nAdministrator\u2019s role is ministerial\u2014the FCC adopts \nthe contribution factor, and the Administrator\u2019s role \nis \nlimited \nto \nproviding \ninputs \ninto \nthat \ndetermination, \nsubject \nto \nFCC \napproval \nand \nnumerous forms of supervision. Whether Section 254 \nor other provisions of the Communications Act \nauthorize \nthe \nFCC \nto \nassign \ntasks \nto \nthe \nAdministrator is therefore immaterial to deciding the \nprivate nondelegation issue in this case.48 \nIV. The Court Should Reject the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \n\u201cCombination\u201d Approach. \nDespite its concerns regarding the public and \nprivate nondelegation issues, the Fifth Circuit \n \n48 In any event, in responding to such a statutory \nchallenge, the FCC may point to 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 154(i), \n201(b), and other provisions. \n\n48 \n \nconcluded that it \u201cneed not resolve either question in \nthis case\u201d because, in its view, \u201cthe combination of \nCongress\u2019s sweeping delegation to FCC and FCC\u2019s \nunauthorized subdelegation to USAC violates the \nLegislative Vesting Clause in Article I, \u00a7 1.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 64a.  \nA. As discussed above, the majority\u2019s reasons for \nbeing \u201chighly skeptical,\u201d Pet. App. 64a, of Congress\u2019s \ndelegation to the FCC are without merit. Rather, as \nthe principal dissent concluded, the text and context \nof Section 254 establish \u201ca clear intelligible principle \ndelimiting agency discretion.\u201d Id. at 97a. Likewise, \nthe court of appeals\u2019 reasons for being \u201cskeptical\u201d of \nthe FCC\u2019s use of the Administrator in a subordinate \ncapacity do not survive scrutiny. Rather, as Judge \nStewart put it in dissent, the majority adopted an \n\u201cexaggerated \nconception \nof \nUSAC\u2019s \nrole \nand \ndiscretion to create a private nondelegation doctrine \nproblem where none exists.\u201d Id. at 103a. The \ncombination of these two non-violations is not \nproblematic.  \nB. In addition, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s approach is \ninconsistent \nwith \nhow \nthis \nCourt \naddressed \nchallenges in Sunshine Anthracite, Currin, and other \ncases. \nSunshine Anthracite\u2014like this case\u2014involved \nboth public and private nondelegation claims. Yet, \nthis Court addressed those issues individually, \nrather than assessing the \u201ccombination\u201d of the two \nissues as the Fifth Circuit would. The Court first \nconcluded that Congress\u2019s authorization for the \nNational Bituminous Coal Commission to \u201cfix \nminimum prices\u201d and \u201cestablish maximum prices\u201d for \nmembers of the \u201cBituminous Coal Code\u201d was \npermissible, holding that \u201cin the hands of experts the \n\n49 \n \ncriteria which Congress has supplied are wholly \nadequate.\u201d 310 U.S. at 388-89, 397-98. Separately, \nthe Court concluded that \u201claw-making is not \nentrusted to the industry.\u201d Id. at 399. Were the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s approach correct, the Court would have \ngone \non \nto \nconsider \nwhether, \nwhile \n\u201cnot \nindependently unconstitutional,\u201d the alleged public \nand private nondelegation problems nonetheless \n\u201ccombine[d] to violate the Constitution\u2019s separation \nof powers.\u201d Pet. App. 64a.  \nCurrin likewise considered both public and \nprivate nondelegation issues. Congress authorized \nthe Secretary of Agriculture to designate markets \nwhere standards for tobacco would apply, subject to \nthe condition that growers in that market vote in \nfavor. See 306 U.S. at 6. The Court separately \nconsidered whether that scheme \u201cinvolve[d] any \ndelegation of legislative authority\u201d to the \u201cgrowers of \ntobacco,\u201d and concluded it did not. Id. at 15. The \nCourt \nthen \nconcluded \nthere \nwas \nalso \nno \n\u201cunconstitutional delegation to the Secretary of \nAgriculture.\u201d Id. at 16. The Court did not consider \nwhether the combination of those features separately \nviolated the separation of powers. \nThe \nFifth \nCircuit\u2019s \nattempt \nto \ndistinguish \nSunshine Anthracite and Currin because \u201cthe Court \nfound the Government had not delegated any \nlegislative power to any private entity\u201d fails. Pet. \nApp. 78a-79a. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s \u201ccombination\u201d \napproach was necessary in this case because that \ncourt did not hold that Section 254 or the FCC\u2019s \nadministration of the Fund violates either the public \nor \nprivate \nnondelegation \ndoctrine. \nSunshine \nAnthracite and Currin similarly rejected both public \nand private nondelegation challenges. The Fifth \n\n50 \n \nCircuit\u2019s approach thus would have called for an \nanalysis \nwhether \nthe \n\u201cnot \nindependently \nunconstitutional\u201d \nparts, \nid. \nat \n64a, \nwere \nan \nunconstitutional whole.  \nBeyond the specific context of public and private \nnondelegation challenges, this Court has often \nconsidered multiple separation-of-powers challenges \n(and other constitutional challenges) in the same \ncase. As in Sunshine Anthracite, the Court did not \nanalyze whether a \u201ccombination\u201d of non-violations \ntogether amounted to a constitutional violation. \nIn Mistretta, for example, prisoners challenging \nthe \nconstitutionality \nof \nthe \nU.S. \nSentencing \nCommission raised several \u201cseparation of powers\u201d \nconcerns, in addition to arguing that \u201cCongress [had] \ndelegated excessive authority to the Commission to \nstructure the [Sentencing] Guidelines.\u201d 488 U.S. at \n370. This Court first addressed and rejected the \nnondelegation \ndoctrine \nchallenge, \neven \nwhile \nagreeing that the Sentencing Commission \u201cenjoys \nsignificant discretion in formulating guidelines.\u201d Id. \nat 377. \u201cHaving determined\u201d that the nondelegation \nchallenge failed, the Court \u201cturn[ed] to\u201d the multiple \ndistinct separation-of-powers challenges regarding \nthe \n\u201c[l]ocation\u201d \nand \n\u201c[c]omposition\u201d \nof \nthe \nCommission and the President\u2019s ability to \u201cremove\u201d \nits members. Id. at 380, 384, 397, 409. Contrary to \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s approach here, the Court \naddressed the nondelegation doctrine issues and \neach of the purported separation-of-powers violations \nseparately, \nwithout \nconsidering \nwhether \nthe \ncombination of these independently constitutional \n\n51 \n \nfacets might together violate the Constitution. See, \ne.g., id. at 381-411.49 \nC. Neither Seila Law nor Free Enterprise Fund \nrequires that courts assess the \u201ccombination\u201d of \nmultiple, individually constitutional, aspects of any \nchallenged statutory or regulatory scheme. Both \ncases addressed a particular separation-of-powers \nquestion not at issue here: what restrictions on the \nPresident\u2019s \nauthority \nto \nremove \nofficers \nare \npermissible, \nconsistent \nwith \nthe \nConstitution\u2019s \nvesting of the \u201cexecutive Power\u201d in the President. See \nSeila Law, 591 U.S. at 227 (quoting Free Enter. \nFund, 561 U.S. at 483).  \nThe removal question at issue in Seila Law was \nwhether the single head of an \u201cagency that wields \nsignificant executive power\u201d could constitutionally \nenjoy protection from at-will removal by the \nPresident. 591 U.S. at 204. While Humphrey\u2019s \nExecutor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602 (1935), had \napproved removal protections for \u201cmultimember \n \n49 See also, e.g., Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 660 \n(1988) (considering whether provisions governing the \nfunction \nof \nan \nindependent \ncounsel \nviolated \nthe \nAppointments Clause of Article II or the \u201climitations of \nArticle III\u201d or otherwise \u201cimpermissibly interfere[d] with \nthe President\u2019s authority under Article II in violation of \nthe constitutional separation of powers); Yakus, 321 U.S. \nat \n418 \n(considering \nmultiple \nconstitutional \nissues \nalongside \na \npublic \nnondelegation \nchallenge); \nJ.W. \nHampton, Jr., 276 U.S. at 404-07, 411-13  (considering \nchallenges to both (1) Congress\u2019s grant of authority to the \nPresident to impose customs duties on certain goods and \n(2) whether such customs duties could be imposed for a \npurpose other than raising revenue).  \n\n52 \n \nexpert agencies that do not wield substantial \nexecutive power\u201d and Morrison had approved \nremoval protection for \u201cinferior officers with limited \nduties,\u201d the head of the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau fit neither description, and the \nCourt was unwilling to \u201cextend those precedents to \nth[is] \u2018new situation.\u2019\u201d 591 U.S. at 216-20. Thus, as \nJudge Higginson explained in dissent, the Court \nsimply \u201capplied precedent\u201d and \u201cdeclined to create a \nnew\u201d \nexception \nto \nthe \nPresident\u2019s \n\u201cotherwise \n\u2018unrestricted removal power.\u2019\u201d Pet. App. 117a \n(quoting Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 204).  \nNor did Free Enterprise Fund establish an \napproach \nthat \nsupports \nthe \nFifth \nCircuit\u2019s \ncombination theory. In that removal case, the \nstatutory scheme provided that members of the \nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board were \n\u201csubstantially insulated from the [Securities and \nExchange] \nCommission\u2019s \ncontrol,\u201d \nand \nSEC \ncommissioners were also understood to be protected \nfrom at-will removal. 561 U.S. at 486-87. For that \nreason, the Court was required to \u201cconsider a new \nsituation not yet encountered\u201d in its line of \nprecedents on removal authority\u2014\u201cwhether these \nseparate layers of protection may be combined.\u201d Id. \nat 483. \nBecause \nthe \n\u201cadded \nlayer \nof \ntenure \nprotection\u201d meant that the \u201cPresident is stripped of \nthe power [the Court\u2019s] precedents have preserved,\u201d \nthe Court struck it down. Id. at 495-96; see also id. at \n514 (\u201cWhile we have sustained in certain cases limits \non the President\u2019s removal power, the Act before us \nimposes a new type of restriction \u2026 .\u201d). \nContrary to the Fifth Circuit\u2019s reading, however, \nFree Enterprise Fund did not purport to announce a \n\u201cgeneral principle\u201d extending beyond a challenge to \n\n53 \n \nmultiple layers of removal protection. Pet. App. 66a. \nIndeed, Free Enterprise Fund itself also involved \nseveral additional challenges to the Board \u201cunder the \nAppointments Clause,\u201d 561 U.S. at 510, each of \nwhich \nthe \nCourt \nconsidered \nand \nrejected \nindependently, without considering whether their \ncombination \nmight \nnonetheless \nviolate \nthe \nConstitution.  \nMoreover, \nremoval \nissues \nare \nsignificantly \ndifferent from nondelegation issues. As this Court \nexplained, on account of the \u201csecond level of tenure \nprotection\u201d at issue in Free Enterprise Fund, \n\u201c[n]either \nthe \nPresident, \nnor \nanyone \ndirectly \nresponsible to him, nor even an officer whose conduct \nhe may review only for good cause, ha[d] full control \nover the Board.\u201d 561 U.S. at 496. Thus, even if both \nlevels of tenure protection were acceptable by \nthemselves, as was the case in Free Enterprise Fund, \nthey combined to create a structure that necessarily \nlimited the President\u2019s authority beyond permissible \nbounds.  \nIn \ncontrast, \nthere \nis \nnothing \ninherently \nproblematic about Congress delegating to an agency \nand the agency separately relying on another entity \nfor \nsome \nfunctions, \nsubject \nto \nthe \nagency\u2019s \nsupervision. Even assuming arguendo that the FCC \nis not adequately supervising the Administrator, the \nFCC retains full authority to do so.  Accordingly, this \nis not a case where \u201ceven\u201d officials \u201cwhose conduct \n[the President] may review only for good cause\u201d lack \ncontrol over the Administrator. Id. And if a court \nwere to determine that some agency lacked full \ncontrol over the entity to which it delegated \nauthority, the appropriate remedy would be to \ncorrect the impermissible delegation. \n\n54 \n \nFinally, the harm in removal cases is cumulative, \nwhile the harm in public and private nondelegation \ncases is not. That is, each layer of tenure protection \nlimits \nthe \nPresident\u2019s \nability \nto \ncontrol \nhis \nsubordinates\u2014each layer\u2019s harm is the same, with \ncumulative effect. In contrast, the harms in public \nnondelegation cases (Congress\u2019s improper delegation \nof its legislative powers) and the harm in private \nnondelegation \ncases \n(an \nagency\u2019s \nimproper \ndelegation of government power to private actors) \nare distinct and non-cumulative. Therefore, for \nexample, a grant of authority by Congress that \nsatisfies the public nondelegation doctrine is not \naffected by an agency\u2019s impermissible delegation of \nnon-ministerial duties to a private party.  \nD. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s approach also would create \nserious workability problems, which in turn would \nlead to confusion in the lower courts. Most notably, \nthe Fifth Circuit \u201coffers no test\u201d for adjudicating \nsituations \ninvolving \nauthorization \nfor \nboth \ngovernment agencies and private parties providing \nministerial support, Pet. App. 123a (Higginson, J., \ndissenting), let alone other separation-of-powers \ncontexts. Neither Free Enterprise Fund nor Seila \nLaw offered one, as neither case spoke so broadly as \nthe Fifth Circuit concluded they did.  \nIndeed, \nthis \nCourt \nhas \nraised \nworkability \nconcerns regarding such an interpretation of Seila \nLaw, \nrejecting \nthe \nargument \nthat \n\u201cthe \nconstitutionality of removal restrictions hinges on\u201d \nthe \u201crelative importance of the regulatory and \nenforcement authority of disparate agencies.\u201d Collins \nv. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220, 253 (2021). \u201cCourts are not \nwell-suited to weigh\u201d such matters. Id. Yet, the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s approach would require courts to go far \n\n55 \n \nbeyond \nsuch \nissues, \nweighing \nthe \n\u201crelative \nimportance\u201d of various constitutional aspects of \nvarious \nstatutory \nor \nregulatory \nschemes \nfor \ndetermining whether their combination exceeds a \nthus-far undefined limit.  \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the Fifth Circuit should be \nreversed.  \n \n \nAndrew Jay Schwartzman \n525 9th Street NW, 7th Fl. \nWashington, DC 20004 \n(202) 241-2408 \nAndySchwartzman \n@gmail.com \n \nCounsel for Benton \nInstitute, NDIA, and \nMediaJustice \n \n \n \nJANUARY 9, 2025 \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nChristopher J.

Thereafter, \nthe Commission shall complete any proceeding to \n\n13a \nimplement subsequent recommendations from any \nJoint Board on universal service within one year after \nreceiving such recommendations. \n(b) Universal service principles \nThe Joint Board and the Commission shall base \npolicies for the preservation and advancement of uni-\nversal service on the following principles: \n(1) Quality and rates \nQuality services should be available at just, rea-\nsonable, and affordable rates. \n(2) Access to advanced services \nAccess to advanced telecommunications and infor-\nmation services should be provided in all regions of \nthe Nation. \n(3) Access in rural and high cost areas \nConsumers in all regions of the Nation, including \nlow-income consumers and those in rural, insular, and \nhigh cost areas, should have access to telecommunica-\ntions and information services, including interex-\nchange services and advanced telecommunications \nand information services, that are reasonably compa-\nrable to those services provided in urban areas and \nthat are available at rates that are reasonably compa-\nrable to rates charged for similar services in urban ar-\neas. \n(4) Equitable and nondiscriminatory con-\ntributions \nAll providers of telecommunications services \nshould make an equitable and nondiscriminatory con-\ntribution to the preservation and advancement of uni-\nversal service. \n\n14a \n(5) Specific and predictable support mech-\nanisms \nThere should be specific, predictable and sufficient \nFederal and State mechanisms to preserve and ad-\nvance universal service. \n(6) Access to advanced telecommunications \nservices for schools, health care, and li-\nbraries \nElementary and secondary schools and class-\nrooms, health care providers, and libraries should \nhave access to advanced telecommunications services \nas described in subsection (h). \n(7) Additional principles \nSuch other principles as the Joint Board and the \nCommission determine are necessary and appropriate \nfor the protection of the public interest, convenience, \nand necessity and are consistent with this chapter. \n(c) Definition \n(1) In general \nUniversal service is an evolving level of telecom-\nmunications services that the Commission shall es-\ntablish periodically under this section, taking into ac-\ncount advances in telecommunications and infor-\nmation technologies and services. The Joint Board in \nrecommending, and the Commission in establishing, \nthe definition of the services that are supported by \nFederal universal service support mechanisms shall \nconsider the extent to which such telecommunications \nservices\u2014 \n(A) are essential to education, public health, \nor public safety; \n(B) have, through the operation of market \n\n15a \nchoices by customers, been subscribed to by a sub-\nstantial majority of residential customers; \n(C) are being deployed in public telecommuni-\ncations networks by telecommunications carriers; \nand \n(D) are consistent with the public interest, \nconvenience, and necessity. \n(2) Alterations and modifications \nThe Joint Board may, from time to time, recom-\nmend to the Commission modifications in the defini-\ntion of the services that are supported by Federal uni-\nversal service support mechanisms. \n(3) Special services \nIn addition to the services included in the defini-\ntion of universal service under paragraph (1), the \nCommission may designate additional services for \nsuch support mechanisms for schools, libraries, and \nhealth care providers for the purposes of subsection \n(h). \n(d) Telecommunications carrier contribution \nEvery telecommunications carrier that provides \ninterstate telecommunications services shall contrib-\nute, on an equitable and nondiscriminatory basis, to \nthe specific, predictable, and sufficient mechanisms \nestablished by the Commission to preserve and ad-\nvance universal service. The Commission may exempt \na carrier or class of carriers from this requirement if \nthe carrier\u2019s telecommunications activities are limited \nto such an extent that the level of such carrier\u2019s con-\ntribution to the preservation and advancement of uni-\nversal service would be de minimis. Any other pro-\nvider of interstate telecommunications may be re-\nquired to contribute to the preservation and \n\n16a \nadvancement of universal service if the public interest \nso requires. \n(e) Universal service support \nAfter the date on which Commission regulations \nimplementing this section take effect, only an eligible \ntelecommunications carrier designated under section \n214(e) of this title shall be eligible to receive specific \nFederal universal service support. A carrier that re-\nceives such support shall use that support only for the \nprovision, maintenance, and upgrading of facilities \nand services for which the support is intended. Any \nsuch support should be explicit and sufficient to \nachieve the purposes of this section. \n(f) \nState authority \nA State may adopt regulations not inconsistent \nwith the Commission\u2019s rules to preserve and advance \nuniversal service. Every telecommunications carrier \nthat provides intrastate telecommunications services \nshall contribute, on an equitable and nondiscrimina-\ntory basis, in a manner determined by the State to the \npreservation and advancement of universal service in \nthat State. A State may adopt regulations to provide \nfor additional definitions and standards to preserve \nand advance universal service within that State only \nto the extent that such regulations adopt additional \nspecific, predictable, and sufficient mechanisms to \nsupport such definitions or standards that do not rely \non or burden Federal universal service support mech-\nanisms. \n(g) Interexchange and interstate services \nWithin 6 months after February 8, 1996, the Com-\nmission shall adopt rules to require that the rates \ncharged by providers of interexchange telecommuni-\ncations services to subscribers in rural and high cost \n\n17a \nareas shall be no higher than the rates charged by \neach such provider to its subscribers in urban areas. \nSuch rules shall also require that a provider of inter-\nstate interexchange telecommunications services \nshall provide such services to its subscribers in each \nState at rates no higher than the rates charged to its \nsubscribers in any other State. \n(h) Telecommunications services for certain \nproviders \n(1) In general \n(A) Health care providers for rural areas \nA telecommunications carrier shall, upon receiv-\ning a bona fide request, provide telecommunications \nservices which are necessary for the provision of \nhealth care services in a State, including instruction \nrelating to such services, to any public or nonprofit \nhealth care provider that serves persons who reside in \nrural areas in that State at rates that are reasonably \ncomparable to rates charged for similar services in ur-\nban areas in that State. A telecommunications carrier \nproviding service under this paragraph shall be enti-\ntled to have an amount equal to the difference, if any, \nbetween the rates for services provided to health care \nproviders for rural areas in a State and the rates for \nsimilar services provided to other customers in com-\nparable rural areas in that State treated as a service \nobligation as a part of its obligation to participate in \nthe mechanisms to preserve and advance universal \nservice. \n(B) Educational providers and libraries \nAll telecommunications carriers serving a geo-\ngraphic area shall, upon a bona fide request for any of \nits services that are within the definition of universal \nservice under subsection (c)(3), provide such services \n\n18a \nto elementary schools, secondary schools, and librar-\nies for educational purposes at rates less than the \namounts charged for similar services to other parties. \nThe discount shall be an amount that the Commis-\nsion, with respect to interstate services, and the \nStates, with respect to intrastate services, determine \nis appropriate and necessary to ensure affordable ac-\ncess to and use of such services by such entities. A tel-\necommunications carrier providing service under this \nparagraph shall\u2014 \n(i) have an amount equal to the amount \nof the discount treated as an offset to its ob-\nligation to contribute to the mechanisms to \npreserve and advance universal service, or \n(ii) notwithstanding the provisions of \nsubsection (e) of this section, receive reim-\nbursement utilizing the support mecha-\nnisms to preserve and advance universal \nservice. \n(2) Advanced services \nThe Commission shall establish competitively neu-\ntral rules\u2014 \n(A) to enhance, to the extent technically \nfeasible and economically reasonable, access to \nadvanced telecommunications and information \nservices for all public and nonprofit elementary \nand secondary school classrooms, health care \nproviders, and libraries; and \n(B) to define the circumstances under \nwhich a telecommunications carrier may be re-\nquired to connect its network to such public in-\nstitutional telecommunications users. \n \n\n19a \n(3) Terms and conditions \nTelecommunications services and network capac-\nity provided to a public institutional telecommunica-\ntions user under this subsection may not be sold, re-\nsold, or otherwise transferred by such user in consid-\neration for money or any other thing of value. \n(4) Eligibility of users \nNo entity listed in this subsection shall be entitled \nto preferential rates or treatment as required by this \nsubsection, if such entity operates as a for-profit busi-\nness, is a school described in paragraph (7)(A) with an \nendowment of more than $50,000,000, or is a library \nor library consortium not eligible for assistance from \na State library administrative agency under the Li-\nbrary Services and Technology Act [20 U.S.C. 9121 et \nseq.]. \n(5) Requirements for certain schools with \ncomputers having Internet access \n(A) Internet safety \n(i) \nIn general \nExcept as provided in clause (ii), an elementary or \nsecondary school having computers with Internet ac-\ncess may not receive services at discount rates under \nparagraph (1)(B) unless the school, school board, local \neducational agency, or other authority with responsi-\nbility for administration of the school\u2014 \n \n(I) \nsubmits to the Commission the \ncertifications \ndescribed \nin \nsubpara-\ngraphs (B) and (C); \n \n(II) submits to the Commission a \ncertification that an Internet safety pol-\nicy has been adopted and implemented \n\n20a \nfor the school under subsection (l); and \n \n(III) ensures the use of such comput-\ners in accordance with the certifications. \n(ii) Applicability \nThe prohibition in clause (i) shall not apply with \nrespect to a school that receives services at discount \nrates under paragraph (1)(B) only for purposes other \nthan the provision of Internet access, Internet service, \nor internal connections. \n(iii) Public notice; hearing \nAn elementary or secondary school described in \nclause (i), or the school board, local educational \nagency, or other authority with responsibility for ad-\nministration of the school, shall provide reasonable \npublic notice and hold at least one public hearing or \nmeeting to address the proposed Internet safety pol-\nicy.

and \n(viii) If the subscriber is seeking to qualify for \nLifeline under the income-based criterion, as set \nforth in \u00a7 54.409, the number of individuals in his \nor her household. \n \n(3) The form provided by the entity enrolling sub-\nscribers shall require each prospective subscriber to \n\n54a \ninitial his or her acknowledgement of each of the cer-\ntifications in paragraphs (d)(3)(i) through (viii) of this \nsection individually and under penalty of perjury: \n(i) The subscriber meets the income-based or \nprogram-based eligibility criteria for receiving \nLifeline, provided in \u00a7 54.409; \n(ii) The subscriber will notify the carrier within \n30 days if for any reason he or she no longer satis-\nfies the criteria for receiving Lifeline including, as \nrelevant, if the subscriber no longer meets the in-\ncome-based or program-based criteria for receiving \nLifeline support, the subscriber is receiving more \nthan one Lifeline benefit, or another member of the \nsubscriber\u2019s household is receiving a Lifeline ben-\nefit. \n(iii) If the subscriber is seeking to qualify for \nLifeline as an eligible resident of Tribal lands, he \nor she lives on Tribal lands, as defined in 54.400(e); \n(iv) If the subscriber moves to a new address, \nhe or she will provide that new address to the eli-\ngible telecommunications carrier within 30 days; \n(v) The subscriber\u2019s household will receive only \none Lifeline service and, to the best of his or her \nknowledge, the subscriber\u2019s household is not al-\nready receiving a Lifeline service;

or \n \n(ii) Querying the appropriate income data-\nbases, confirming that the subscriber continues to \nmeet the income-based eligibility requirements for \nLifeline, and documenting the results of that re-\nview. \n \n(iii) If the subscriber\u2019s program-based or \n\n56a \nincome-based eligibility for Lifeline cannot be de-\ntermined by accessing one or more eligibility data-\nbases, then the eligible telecommunications carrier \nmust obtain a signed certification from the sub-\nscriber confirming the subscriber\u2019s continued eligi-\nbility. If the subscriber\u2019s eligibility was previously \nconfirmed through an eligibility database during \nenrollment or a prior recertification and the sub-\nscriber is no longer included in any eligibility da-\ntabase, the eligible telecommunications carrier \nmust obtain both an Annual Recertification Form \nand documentation meeting the requirements of \nparagraph (b)(1)(i)(B) or (c)(1)(i)(B) from that sub-\nscriber to complete the process. Eligible telecom-\nmunications carriers must use the Wireline Com-\npetition Bureau-approved universal Annual Recer-\ntification Form, except where state law, state reg-\nulation, a state Lifeline administrator, or a state \nagency requires eligible telecommunications carri-\ners to use state-specific Lifeline recertification \nforms. \n \n(iv) In states in which the National Verifier has \nbeen implemented, the eligible telecommunica-\ntions carrier cannot re-certify subscribers not \nfound in the National Verifier by obtaining a certi-\nfication form from the subscriber. \n \n(3) Where the National Verifier, state Lifeline ad-\nministrator, or other state agency is responsible for re-\ncertification of a subscriber\u2019s Lifeline eligibility, the \nNational Verifier, state Lifeline administrator, or \nstate agency must confirm a subscriber\u2019s current eli-\ngibility to receive a Lifeline service by: \n \n(i) Querying the appropriate eligibility data-\nbases, confirming that the subscriber still meets \nthe program-based eligibility requirements for \n\n57a \nLifeline, and documenting the results of that re-\nview; or \n \n(ii) Querying the appropriate income data-\nbases, confirming that the subscriber continues to \nmeet the income-based eligibility requirements for \nLifeline, and documenting the results of that re-\nview. \n \n(iii) If the subscriber\u2019s program-based or in-\ncome-based eligibility for Lifeline cannot be deter-\nmined by accessing one or more eligibility data-\nbases, then the National Verifier, state Lifeline ad-\nministrator, or state agency must obtain a signed \ncertification from the subscriber confirming the \nsubscriber\u2019s continued eligibility. If the sub-\nscriber\u2019s eligibility was previously confirmed \nthrough an eligibility database during enrollment \nor a prior recertification and the subscriber is no \nlonger included in any eligibility database, the Na-\ntional Verifier, state Lifeline administrator, or \nstate agency must obtain both an approved Annual \nRecertification Form and documentation meeting \nthe requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i)(B) or \n(c)(1)(i)(B) from that subscriber to complete the \ncertification process. Entities responsible for re-\ncertification under this section must use the Wire-\nline Competition Bureau-approved universal An-\nnual Recertification Form, except where state law, \nstate regulation, a state Lifeline administrator, or \na state agency requires eligible telecommunica-\ntions carriers to use state-specific Lifeline recerti-\nfication forms, or where the National Verifier \nRecertification Form is required. \n \n(4) Where the National Verifier, state Lifeline ad-\nministrator, or other state agency is responsible for re-\ncertification of subscribers\u2019 Lifeline eligibility, the \n\n58a \nNational Verifier, state Lifeline administrator, or \nother state agency must provide to each eligible tele-\ncommunications carrier the results of its annual re-\ncertification efforts with respect to that eligible tele-\ncommunications carrier\u2019s subscribers. \n \n(5) If an eligible telecommunications carrier is un-\nable to re-certify a subscriber or has been notified by \nthe National Verifier, a state Lifeline administrator, \nor other state agency that it is unable to re-certify a \nsubscriber, the eligible telecommunications carrier \nmust comply with the de-enrollment requirements \nprovided for in \u00a7 54.405(e)(4). \n(g) One-Per-Household Worksheet. If the prospec-\ntive subscriber shares an address with one or more ex-\nisting Lifeline subscribers according to the National \nLifeline Accountability Database or National Verifier, \nthe prospective subscriber must complete a form cer-\ntifying compliance with the one-per-household rule \nupon initial enrollment. Eligible telecommunications \ncarriers must fulfill the requirement in this para-\ngraph (g) by using the Household Worksheet, as pro-\nvided by the Wireline Competition Bureau. Where \nstate law, state regulation, a state Lifeline adminis-\ntrator, or a state agency requires eligible telecommu-\nnications carriers to use state-specific Lifeline enroll-\nment forms, eligible telecommunications carriers may \nuse those forms in place of the Commission\u2019s House-\nhold Worksheet. At re-certification, if there are \nchanges to the subscriber\u2019s household that would pre-\nvent the subscriber from accurately certifying to par-\nagraph (d)(3)(vi) of this section, then the subscriber \nmust complete a new Household Worksheet. Eligible \ntelecommunications carriers must mark subscribers \nas having completed a Household Worksheet in the \nNational Lifeline Accountability Database if and only \n\n59a \nif the subscriber shares an address with an existing \nLifeline subscriber, as reported by the National Life-\nline Accountability Database. \n(h) National Verifier transition. As the National \nVerifier is implemented in a state, the obligations in \nparagraphs (b) through (g) of this section with respect \nto the National Verifier and eligible telecommunica-\ntions carriers will also take effect. \n(i) Survivors of domestic violence. All survivors \nseeking to receive emergency communications sup-\nport from the Lifeline program must have their eligi-\nbility to participate in the program confirmed through \nthe National Verifier. The National Verifier will also \ntransition survivors approaching the end of their six-\nmonth emergency support period in a manner con-\nsistent with the requirements applied to eligible tele-\ncommunications carriers at paragraph (f) of this sec-\ntion, and the National Verifier will de-enroll survivors \nwhose continued eligibility to participate in the Life-\nline program cannot be confirmed, consistent with \n\u00a7 54.405(e)(6). \n \n\n60a \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.500 provides, in relevant part: \nTerms and definitions. \n[\u2026] \nLowest corresponding price. \u201cLowest corresponding \nprice\u201d is the lowest price that a service provider \ncharges to non-residential customers who are simi-\nlarly situated to a particular school, library, or library \nconsortium for similar services. \n \n \n\n61a \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.507 provides: \nCap. \n(a) Amount of the annual cap. The aggregate an-\nnual cap on federal universal service support for \nschools and libraries shall be $3.9 billion per funding \nyear, of which $1 billion per funding year will be avail-\nable for category two services, as described in \n\u00a7 54.502(a)(2), unless demand for category one ser-\nvices is higher than available funding. \n \n(1) Inflation increase. In funding year 2016 and \nsubsequent funding years, the $3.9 billion funding cap \non federal universal service support for schools and li-\nbraries shall be automatically increased annually to \ntake into account increases in the rate of inflation as \ncalculated in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. \n \n(2) Increase calculation. To measure increases \nin the rate of inflation for the purposes of this para-\ngraph (a), the Commission shall use the Gross Domes-\ntic Product Chain-type Price Index (GDP-CPI). To \ncompute the annual increase as required by this par-\nagraph (a), the percentage increase in the GDP-CPI \nfrom the previous year will be used. For instance, the \nannual increase in the GDP-CPI from 2008 to 2009 \nwould be used for the 2010 funding year. The increase \nshall be rounded to the nearest 0.1 percent by round-\ning 0.05 percent and above to the next higher 0.1 per-\ncent and otherwise rounding to the next lower 0.1 per-\ncent. This percentage increase shall be added to the \namount of the annual funding cap from the previous \nfunding year. If the yearly average GDP-CPI de-\ncreases or stays the same, the annual funding cap \nshall remain the same as the previous year. \n\n62a \n \n(3) Public notice. When the calculation of the \nyearly average GDP-CPI is determined, the Wireline \nCompetition Bureau shall publish a public notice in \nthe FEDERAL REGISTER within 60 days announcing \nany increase of the annual funding cap including any \nincrease to the $1 billion funding level available for \ncategory two services based on the rate of inflation. \n \n(4) Filing window requests. At the close of the \nfiling window, if requests for category one services are \ngreater than the available funding, the Administrator \nshall shift category two funds to provide support for \ncategory one services. If available funds are sufficient \nto meet demand for category one services, the Admin-\nistrator, at the direction of the Wireline Competition \nBureau, shall direct the remaining additional funds to \nprovide support for category two requests. \n \n(5) Amount of unused funds. All funds collected \nthat are unused shall be carried forward into subse-\nquent funding years for use in the schools and librar-\nies support mechanism in accordance with the public \ninterest and notwithstanding the annual cap. The \nChief, Wireline Competition Bureau, is delegated au-\nthority to determine the proportion of unused funds, \nif any, needed to meet category one demand, and to \ndirect the Administrator to use any remaining funds \nto provide support for category two requests. The Ad-\nministrator shall report to the Commission, on a quar-\nterly basis, funding that is unused from prior years of \nthe schools and libraries support mechanism. \n \n(6) Application of unused funds. On an annual \nbasis, in the second quarter of each calendar year, all \nfunds that are collected and that are unused from \nprior years shall be available for use in the next full \nfunding year of the schools and libraries mechanism \nin \naccordance \nwith \nthe \npublic \ninterest \nand \n\n63a \nnotwithstanding the annual cap as described in this \nparagraph (a). \n(b) Funding year. A funding year for purposes of the \nschools and libraries cap shall be the period July 1 \nthrough June 30. \n(c) Requests. The Administrator shall implement an \ninitial filing period that treats all schools and libraries \nfiling an application within that period as if their ap-\nplications were simultaneously received. The initial \nfiling period shall begin and conclude on dates to be \ndetermined by the Administrator with the approval of \nthe Chief of the Wireline Competition Bureau. The \nAdministrator shall maintain on the Administrator\u2019s \nWeb site a running tally of the funds already commit-\nted for the existing funding year. The Administrator \nmay implement such additional filing periods as it \ndeems necessary. \n(d) Annual filing requirement. \n \n(1) Schools and libraries, and consortia of such eli-\ngible entities shall file new funding requests for each \nfunding year no sooner than the July 1 prior to the \nstart of that funding year. Schools, libraries, and eli-\ngible consortia must use recurring services for which \ndiscounts have been committed by the Administrator \nwithin the funding year for which the discounts were \nsought. \n \n(2) Installation of category one non-recurring ser-\nvices may begin on January 1 prior to the July 1 start \nof the funding year, provided the following conditions \nare met: \n \n(i) Construction begins after selection of the \nservice provider pursuant to a posted FCC Form \n470, \n\n64a \n \n(ii) A category one recurring service must de-\npend on the installation of the infrastructure, and \n \n(iii) The actual service start date for that recur-\nring service is on or after the start of the funding \nyear (July 1). \n(3) Installation of category two non-recurring ser-\nvices may begin on April 1 prior to the July 1 start of \nthe funding year. \n(4) The deadline for implementation of all non-re-\ncurring services will be September 30 following the \nclose of the funding year. An applicant may request \nand receive from the Administrator an extension of \nthe implementation deadline for non-recurring ser-\nvices if it satisfies one of the following criteria: \n(i) The applicant\u2019s funding commitment deci-\nsion letter is issued by the Administrator on or af-\nter March 1 of the funding year for which discounts \nare authorized; \n(ii) The applicant receives a service provider \nchange authorization or service substitution au-\nthorization from the Administrator on or after \nMarch 1 of the funding year for which discounts \nare authorized; \n(iii) The applicant\u2019s service provider is unable \nto complete implementation for reasons beyond the \nservice provider\u2019s control; or \n(iv) The applicant\u2019s service provider is unwill-\ning to complete installation because funding dis-\nbursements are delayed while the Administrator \ninvestigates the application for program compli-\nance. \n(e) Long term contracts. If schools and libraries en-\nter into long term contracts for eligible services, the \n\n65a \nAdministrator shall only commit funds to cover the \npro rata portion of such a long term contract sched-\nuled to be delivered during the funding year for which \nuniversal service support is sought. \n(f) Rules of distribution. When the filing period de-\nscribed in paragraph (c) of this section closes, the Ad-\nministrator shall calculate the total demand for both \ncategory one and category two support submitted by \napplicants during the filing period. If total demand for \nthe funding year exceeds the total support available \nfor category one or both categories, the Administrator \nshall take the following steps: \n \n(1) Category one. The Administrator shall first \ncalculate the demand for category one services for all \ndiscount levels. The Administrator shall allocate the \ncategory one funds to these requests for support, be-\nginning with the most economically disadvantaged \nschools and libraries, as determined by the schools \nand libraries discount matrix in \u00a7 54.505(c). Schools \nand libraries eligible for a 90 percent discount shall \nreceive first priority for the category one funds. The \nAdministrator shall next allocate funds toward the re-\nquests submitted by schools and libraries eligible for \nan 80 percent discount, then for a 70 percent discount, \nand shall continue committing funds for category one \nservices in the same manner to the applicants at each \ndescending discount level until there are no funds re-\nmaining. \n \n(2) Category two. The Administrator shall next \ncalculate the demand for category two services for all \ndiscount categories as determined by the schools and \nlibraries discount matrix in \u00a7 54.505(c). If that de-\nmand exceeds the category two budget for that fund-\ning year, the Administrator shall allocate the category \ntwo funds beginning with the most economically \n\n66a \ndisadvantaged schools and libraries, as determined by \nthe schools and libraries discount matrix in \n\u00a7 54.505(c). The Administrator shall allocate funds to-\nward the category two requests submitted by schools \nand libraries eligible for an 85 percent discount first, \nthen for a 80 percent discount, and shall continue \ncommitting funds in the same manner to the appli-\ncants at each descending discount level until there are \nno category two funds remaining. \n \n(3) To the extent that there are single discount per-\ncentage levels associated with \u201cshared services\u201d under \n\u00a7 54.505(b)(4), the Administrator shall allocate funds \nto the applicants at each descending discount level \n(e.g., 90 percent, 89 percent, then 88 percent) until \nthere are no funds remaining. \n \n(4) In the event that demand exceeds available \nfunding, requests for category one services used off-\npremises shall be funded after on-premises category \none and category two services. \n \n(5) For paragraphs (f)(1) through (4) of this section, \nif the remaining funds are not sufficient to support all \nof the funding requests within a particular discount \nlevel, the Administrator shall allocate funds at that \ndiscount level using the percentage of students eligi-\nble for the National School Lunch Program. Thus, if \nthere is not enough support to fund all requests at the \n40 percent discount level, the Administrator shall al-\nlocate funds beginning with those applicants with the \nhighest percentage of NSLP eligibility for that dis-\ncount level by funding those applicants with 19 per-\ncent NSLP eligibility, then 18 percent NSLP eligibil-\nity, and shall continue committing funds in the same \nmanner to applicants at each descending percentage \nof NSLP until there are no funds remaining. \n \n\n67a \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.511 provides: \nOrdering services. \n(a) Selecting a provider of eligible services. Ex-\ncept as exempted in \u00a7 54.503(e), in selecting a provider \nof eligible services, schools, libraries, library consor-\ntia, and consortia including any of those entities shall \ncarefully consider all bids submitted and must select \nthe most cost-effective service offering. In determin-\ning which service offering is the most cost-effective, \nentities may consider relevant factors other than the \npre-discount prices submitted by providers, but price \nshould be the primary factor considered. \n(b) Lowest corresponding price. Providers of eligi-\nble services shall not submit bids for or charge schools, \nschool districts, libraries, library consortia, or consor-\ntia including any of these entities a price above the \nlowest corresponding price for supported services, un-\nless the Commission, with respect to interstate ser-\nvices or the state commission with respect to intra-\nstate services, finds that the lowest corresponding \nprice is not compensatory. Promotional rates offered \nby a service provider for a period of more than 90 days \nmust be included among the comparable rates upon \nwhich the lowest corresponding price is determined. \n \n \n\n68a \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.603 provides: \nConsortia, telecommunications services, and \nexisting contracts. \n(a) Consortia. \n \n(1) Under the Telecommunications Program, an el-\nigible health care provider may join a consortium with \nother eligible health care providers; with schools, li-\nbraries, and library consortia eligible under subpart F \nof this part; and with public sector (governmental) en-\ntities to order telecommunications services. With one \nexception, eligible health care providers participating \nin consortia with ineligible private sector members \nshall not be eligible for supported services under this \nsubpart. A consortium may include ineligible private \nsector entities if such consortium is only receiving ser-\nvices at tariffed rates or at market rates from those \nproviders who do not file tariffs. \n \n(2) For consortia, universal service support under \nthe Telecommunications Program shall apply only to \nthe portion of eligible services used by an eligible \nhealth care provider. \n(b) Telecommunications services. Any telecommu-\nnications service that is the subject of a properly com-\npleted bona fide request by a rural health care pro-\nvider shall be eligible for universal service support. \nUpon submitting a bona fide request to a telecommu-\nnications carrier, each eligible rural health care pro-\nvider is entitled to receive the most cost-effective, com-\nmercially-available telecommunications service, and a \ntelecommunications service carrier that is eligible for \nsupport under the Telecommunications Program shall \nprovide such service at the urban rate, as defined in \n\u00a7 54.604. \n\n69a \n(c) Existing contracts. A signed contract for services \neligible for Telecommunications Program support \npursuant to this subpart between an eligible health \ncare provider, as defined under \u00a7 54.600, and a service \nprovider shall be exempt from the competitive bid re-\nquirements as set forth in \u00a7 54.622(i). \n \n \n\n70a \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.604 provides: \nDetermining the urban rate. \n(a) Effective funding year 2024: \n \n(1) If a rural health care provider requests support \nfor an eligible service to be funded from the Telecom-\nmunications Program that is to be provided over a dis-\ntance that is less than or equal to the \u201cstandard urban \ndistance,\u201d as defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this sec-\ntion, for the state in which it is located, the \u201curban \nrate\u201d for that service shall be a rate no higher than the \nhighest tariffed or publicly-available rate charged to a \ncommercial customer for a functionally similar service \nin any city with a population of 50,000 or more in that \nstate, calculated as if it were provided between two \npoints within the city. \n \n(2) If a rural health care provider requests an eli-\ngible service to be provided over a distance that is \ngreater than the \u201cstandard urban distance,\u201d as de-\nfined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, for the state \nin which it is located, the urban rate for that service \nshall be a rate no higher than the highest tariffed or \npublicly-available rate charged to a commercial cus-\ntomer for a functionally similar service provided over \nthe standard urban distance in any city with a popu-\nlation of 50,000 or more in that state, calculated as if \nthe service were provided between two points within \nthe city. \n \n(3) The \u201cstandard urban distance\u201d for a state is the \naverage of the longest diameters of all cities with a \npopulation of 50,000 or more within the state. \n \n(4) The Administrator shall calculate the \u201cstand-\nard urban distance\u201d and shall post the \u201cstandard ur-\nban distance\u201d and the maximum supported distance \n\n71a \nfor each state on its website. \n(b) As of funding year 2025, if a rural health care pro-\nvider requests support for an eligible service to be \nfunded from the Telecommunications Program the \n\u201curban rate\u201d for that service shall be a rate no higher \nthan the highest tariffed or publicly-available rate \ncharged to a commercial customer for a functionally \nsimilar service in any city with a population of 50,000 \nor more in that state, calculated as if it were provided \nbetween two points within the city. \n \n \n\n72a \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.605 provides: \nDetermining the rural rate. \n(a) Effective funding year 2024, the rural rate shall be \nthe average of the rates actually being charged to com-\nmercial customers, other than health care providers, \nfor identical or similar services provided by the tele-\ncommunications carrier providing the service in the \nrural area in which the health care provider is located. \nThe rates included in this average shall be for services \nprovided over the same distance as the eligible ser-\nvice. The rates averaged to calculate the rural rate \nmust not include any rates reduced by universal ser-\nvice support mechanisms. The \u201crural rate\u201d shall be \nused as described in this subpart to determine the \ncredit or reimbursement due to a telecommunications \ncarrier that provides eligible telecommunications ser-\nvices to eligible health care providers. \n(b) If the telecommunications carrier serving the \nhealth care provider is not providing any identical or \nsimilar services in the rural area, then the rural rate \nshall be the average of the tariffed and other publicly \navailable rates, not including any rates reduced by \nuniversal service programs, charged for the same or \nsimilar services in that rural area over the same dis-\ntance as the eligible service by other carriers. If there \nare no tariffed or publicly available rates for such ser-\nvices in that rural area, or if the carrier reasonably \ndetermines that this method for calculating the rural \nrate is unfair, then the carrier shall submit for the \nstate commission\u2019s approval, for intrastate rates, or \nfor the Commission\u2019s approval, for interstate rates, a \ncost-based rate for the provision of the service in the \nmost economically efficient, reasonably available \nmanner. \n\n73a \n \n(1) The carrier must provide, to the state commis-\nsion, for intrastate rates, or to the Commission, for in-\nterstate rates, a justification of the proposed rural \nrate, including an itemization of the costs of providing \nthe requested service. \n \n(2) The carrier must provide such information pe-\nriodically thereafter as required, by the state commis-\nsion for intrastate rates or the Commission for inter-\nstate rates. In doing so, the carrier much take into ac-\ncount anticipated and actual demand for telecommu-\nnications services by all customers who will use the \nfacilities over which services are being provided to el-\nigible health care providers. \n \n \n\n74a \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.606 provides: \nCalculating support. \n(a) The amount of universal service support provided \nfor an eligible service to be funded from the Telecom-\nmunications program shall be the difference, if any, \nbetween the urban rate and the rural rate charged for \nthe services, as defined in this section. In addition, all \nreasonable charges that are incurred by taking such \nservices, such as state and federal taxes, shall be eli-\ngible for universal service support. Charges for termi-\nnation liability, penalty surcharges, and other charges \nnot included in the cost of taking such service shall \nnot be covered by the universal service support mech-\nanisms. \n(b) The universal service support mechanisms shall \nprovide support for intrastate telecommunications \nservices, as set forth in \u00a7 54.101(a), provided to rural \nhealth care providers as well as interstate telecommu-\nnications services. \n(c) Mobile rural health care providers \u2014 \n \n(1) Calculation of support. The support amount \nallowed under the Telecommunications Program for \nsatellite services provided to mobile rural health care \nproviders is calculated by comparing the rate for the \nsatellite service to the rate for an urban wireline ser-\nvice with a similar bandwidth. Support for satellite \nservices shall not be capped at an amount of a func-\ntionally similar wireline alternative. Where the mo-\nbile rural health care provider provides service in \nmore than one state, the calculation shall be based on \nthe urban areas in each state, proportional to the \nnumber of locations served in each state. \n\n75a \n \n(2) Documentation of support. \n \n(i) Mobile rural health care providers shall pro-\nvide to the Administrator documentation of the \nprice of bandwidth equivalent wireline services in \nthe urban area in the state or states where the ser-\nvice is provided. Mobile rural health care providers \nshall provide to the Administrator the number of \nsites the mobile health care provider will serve \nduring the funding year. \n \n(ii) Where a mobile rural health care provider \nserves less than eight different sites per year, the \nmobile rural health care provider shall provide to \nthe Administrator documentation of the price of \nbandwidth equivalent wireline services. In such \ncase, the Administrator shall determine on a case-\nby-case basis whether the telecommunications ser-\nvice selected by the mobile rural health care pro-\nvider is the most cost-effective option. Where a mo-\nbile rural health care provider seeks a more expen-\nsive satellite-based service when a less expensive \nwireline alternative is most cost-effective, the mo-\nbile rural health care provider shall be responsible \nfor the additional cost. \n \n \n\n76a \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.622 provides: \nCompetitive bidding requirements and exemp-\ntions. \n(a) Competitive bidding requirement. All appli-\ncants are required to engage in a competitive bidding \nprocess for supported services, facilities, or equip-\nment, as applicable, consistent with the requirements \nset forth in this section and any additional applicable \nstate, Tribal, local, or other procurement require-\nments, unless they qualify for an exemption listed in \nparagraph (i) in this section. In addition, applicants \nmay engage in competitive bidding even if they qual-\nify for an exemption. Applicants who utilize a compet-\nitive bidding exemption may proceed directly to filing \na funding request as described in \u00a7 54.623. \n(b) Fair and open process. \n \n(1) Applicants participating in the Telecommuni-\ncations Program or Healthcare Connect Fund Pro-\ngram must conduct a fair and open competitive bid-\nding process. The following actions are necessary to \nsatisfy the \u201cfair and open\u201d competitive standard in the \nTelecommunications Program and the Healthcare \nConnect Fund Program: \n \n(i) All potential bidders and service providers \nmust have access to the same information and \nmust be treated in the same manner throughout \nthe procurement process. \n \n(ii) Service providers who intend to bid on sup-\nported services many not simultaneously help the \napplicant complete its request for proposal (RFP) \nor Request for Services form. \n \n(iii) Service providers who have submitted a bid \nto provide supported services, equipment, or \n\n77a \nfacilities to a health care provider may not simul-\ntaneously help the health care provider evaluate \nsubmitted bids or choose a winning bid. \n \n(iv) Applicants must respond to all service pro-\nviders that have submitted questions or proposals \nduring the competitive bidding process. \n \n(v) All applicants and service providers must \ncomply with any applicable state, Tribal, or local \nprocurement laws, in addition to the Commission\u2019s \ncompetitive bidding requirements. The competi-\ntive bidding requirements in this section are not \nintended to preempt such state, Tribal, or local re-\nquirements. \n(c) Selecting a cost-effective service. In selecting a \nprovider of eligible services, the applicant shall care-\nfully consider all bids submitted and must select the \nmost cost-effective means of meeting its specific \nhealth care needs. \u201cCost-effective\u201d is defined as the \nmethod that costs the least after consideration of the \nfeatures, quality of transmission, reliability, and \nother factors that the health care provider deems rel-\nevant to choosing a method of providing the required \nhealth care services. In the Healthcare Connect Fund \nProgram, when choosing the most \u201ccost-effective\u201d bid, \nprice must be a primary factor, but need not be the \nonly primary factor. A non-price factor may receive an \nequal weight to price, but may not receive a greater \nweight than price. \n(d) Bid evaluation criteria. Applicants must de-\nvelop weighted evaluation criteria (e.g., a scoring ma-\ntrix) that demonstrates how the applicant will choose \nthe most cost-effective bid before submitting its re-\nquest for services. The applicant must specify on its \nbid evaluation worksheet and/or scoring matrix the \n\n78a \nrequested services for which it seeks bids, the infor-\nmation provided to bidders to allow bidders to reason-\nably determine the needs of the applicant, its mini-\nmum requirements for the developed weighted evalu-\nation criteria, and each service provider\u2019s proposed \nservice levels for the criteria. The applicant must also \nspecify the disqualification factors, if any, that it will \nuse to remove bids or bidders from further considera-\ntion. After reviewing the bid submissions and identi-\nfying the bids that satisfy the applicant\u2019s specific \nneeds, the applicant must then select the service pro-\nvider that offers the most cost-effective service. \n(e) Request for Services. Applicants must submit the \nfollowing documents to the Administrator in order to \ninitiate competitive bidding: \n \n(1) Request for Services, including certifica-\ntions. The applicant must submit a Request for Ser-\nvices and make the following certifications as part of \nits Request for Services: \n \n(i) The entity seeking supported services is a \npublic or nonprofit health care provider that falls \nwithin one of the categories set forth in the defini-\ntion of health care provider listed in \u00a7 54.600, or \nexpects to be such a public or nonprofit health care \nprovider before the end of the funding year for \nwhich the supported services are requested pro-\nvided that the entity has received a conditional ap-\nproval of eligibility pursuant to \u00a7 54.601(c); \n \n(ii) The health care provider seeking supported \nservices is physically located in a rural area as de-\nfined in \u00a7 54.600 or is a member of a Healthcare \nConnect Fund Program consortium which satisfies \nthe rural health care provider composition require-\nments set forth in \u00a7 54.607(b). If an entity seeks \n\n79a \nsupported services under a conditional approval of \neligibility set forth in \u00a7 54.601(c), the entity ex-\npects to be located in a rural area defined in \n\u00a7 54.600 before the end of the funding year for \nwhich the supported services are requested, or \nplans to be a member of a Healthcare Connect \nFund Program consortium which satisfies the ru-\nral health care provider composition requirements \nset forth in \u00a7 54.607(b) before the end of the fund-\ning year for which the supported services are re-\nquested; \n(iii) The person signing the application is au-\nthorized to submit the application on behalf of the \nhealth care provider or consortium applicant; \n \n(iv) The person signing the application has ex-\namined the Request for Services and all attach-\nments, and to the best of his or her knowledge, in-\nformation, and belief, all statements contained in \nthe request are true; \n \n(v) The applicant has complied with any appli-\ncable state, Tribal, or local procurement rules; \n \n(vi) All requested Rural Health Care Program \nsupport will be used solely for purposes reasonably \nrelated to the provision of health care service or in-\nstruction that the health care provider is legally \nauthorized to provide under the law of the state in \nwhich the services are provided; \n \n(vii) The supported services will not be sold, re-\nsold, or transferred in consideration for money or \nany other thing of value; \n \n(viii) The applicant satisfies all of the require-\nments under section 254 of the Act and applicable \nCommission rules; and \n\n80a \n \n(ix) The applicant has reviewed all applicable \nrequirements for the Telecommunications Pro-\ngram or the Healthcare Connect Fund Program, as \napplicable, and will comply with those require-\nments. \n \n(2) Aggregated purchase details. If the service \nor services are being purchased as part of an aggre-\ngated purchase with other entities or individuals, the \nfull details of any such arrangement, including the \nidentities of all co-purchasers and the portion of the \nservice or services being purchased by the health care \nprovider, must be submitted. \n \n(3) Bid evaluation criteria. Requirements for \nbid evaluation criteria are described in paragraph (d) \nin this section and must be included with the appli-\ncant\u2019s Request for Services. \n \n(4) Declaration of Assistance. All applicants \nmust submit a \u201cDeclaration of Assistance\u201d with their \nRequest for Services. In the Declaration of Assistance, \nthe applicant must identify each and every consult-\nant, service provider, and other outside expert, \nwhether paid or unpaid, who aided in the preparation \nof its applications. The applicant must also describe \nthe nature of the relationship it has with each consult-\nant, service provider, or other outside expert provid-\ning such assistance. \n \n(5) Request for proposal (if applicable). \n \n(i) Any applicant may use an RFP. Applicants \nwho use an RFP must submit the RFP and any ad-\nditional relevant bidding information to the Ad-\nministrator with its Request for Services. \n \n(ii) An applicant must submit an RFP: \n \n(A) If it is required to issue an RFP under \n\n81a \napplicable State, Tribal, or local procurement \nrules or regulations; \n \n(B) If the applicant is a consortium seeking \nmore than $100,000 in program support during \nthe funding year, including applications that \nseek more than $100,000 in program support \nfor a multi-year commitment; or \n \n(C) If the applicant is a consortium seeking \nsupport for participant-constructed and owned \nnetwork facilities. \n \n(iii) RFP requirements. \n \n(A) An RFP must provide sufficient infor-\nmation to enable an effective competitive bid-\nding process, including describing the health \ncare provider\u2019s service needs and defining the \nscope of the project and network costs (if appli-\ncable). \n \n(B) An RFP must specify the time period \nduring which bids will be accepted. \n \n(C) An RFP must include the bid evaluation \ncriteria described in paragraph (d) in this sec-\ntion, and solicit sufficient information so that \nthe criteria can be applied effectively. \n \n(D) Consortium applicants seeking support \nfor long-term capital investments whose useful \nlife extends beyond the time period of the fund-\ning commitment (e.g., facilities constructed and \nowned by the applicant, fiber indefeasible \nrights of use) must seek bids in the same RFP \nfrom service providers who propose to meet \nthose needs via services provided over service \nprovider-owned facilities, for a time period com-\nparable to the life of the proposed capital \n\n82a \ninvestment. \n \n(E) Applicants may prepare RFPs in any \nmanner that complies with the rules in this \nsubpart and any applicable state, Tribal, or lo-\ncal procurement rules or regulations. \n \n(6) Additional requirements for Healthcare \nConnect Fund Program consortium applicants. \n \n(i) Network plan. Consortium applicants must \nsubmit a narrative describing specific elements of \ntheir network plan with their Request for Services. \nConsortia applicants are required to use program \nsupport for the purposes described in their narra-\ntive. The required elements of the narrative in-\nclude: \n \n(A) Goals and objectives of the network; \n \n(B) Strategy for aggregating the specific \nneeds of health care providers (including pro-\nviders that serve rural areas) within a state or \nregion; \n \n(C) Strategy for leveraging existing technol-\nogy to adopt the most efficient and cost-effec-\ntive means of connecting those providers; \n \n(D) How the supported network will be used \nto improve or provide health care delivery; \n \n(E) Any previous experience in developing \nand managing health information technology \n(including telemedicine) programs; and \n \n(F) A project management plan outlining \nthe project\u2019s leadership and management struc-\nture, and a work plan, schedule, and budget. \n \n(ii) Letters of agency (LOA). Consortium ap-\nplicants must submit LOAs pursuant to \u00a7 54.610. \n\n83a \n(f) Public posting by the Administrator. The Ad-\nministrator shall post on its website the following \ncompetitive bidding documents, as applicable: \n \n(1) Request for Services; \n \n(2) Bid evaluation criteria; \n \n(3) RFP; and \n \n(4) Network plans for Healthcare Connect Fund \nProgram applicants. \n(g) 28-day waiting period. After posting the docu-\nments described in paragraph (f) in this section, as ap-\nplicable, on its website, the Administrator shall send \nconfirmation of the posting to the applicant. The ap-\nplicant shall wait at least 28 days from the date on \nwhich its competitive bidding documents are posted \non the Administrator\u2019s website before selecting and \ncommitting to a service provider.

Applicants are re-\nquired to submit the documentation, identified in \n\u00a7 54.623, to support their certifications. \n \n(2) Applicants who plan to request evergreen sta-\ntus under this section must enter into a contract that \nidentifies both parties, is signed and dated by the \nhealth care provider or Consortium Leader after the \n28-day waiting period expires, and specifies the type, \nterm, and cost of service(s). \n\n84a \n(h) Gift restrictions. \n \n(1) Subject to paragraphs (h)(3) and (4) in this sec-\ntion, an eligible health care provider or consortium \nthat includes eligible health care providers, may not \ndirectly or indirectly solicit or accept any gift, gratu-\nity, favor, entertainment, loan, or any other thing of \nvalue from a service provider participating in or seek-\ning to participate in the Rural Health Care Program. \nNo such service provider shall offer or provide any \nsuch gift, gratuity, favor, entertainment, loan, or \nother thing of value except as otherwise provided in \nthis section. Modest refreshments not offered as part \nof a meal, items with little intrinsic value intended \nsolely for presentation, and items worth $20 or less, \nincluding meals, may be offered or provided, and ac-\ncepted by any individual or entity subject to this rule, \nif the value of these items received by any individual \ndoes not exceed $50 from any one service provider per \nfunding year. The $50 amount for any service provider \nshall be calculated as the aggregate value of all gifts \nprovided during a funding year by the individuals \nspecified in paragraph (h)(2)(ii) in this section. \n \n(2) For purposes of this paragraph: \n \n(i) The terms \u201chealth care provider\u201d or \u201cconsor-\ntium\u201d shall include all individuals who are on the \ngoverning boards of such entities and all employ-\nees, officers, representatives, agents, consultants, \nor independent contractors of such entities in-\nvolved on behalf of such health care provider or \nconsortium with the Rural Health Care Program, \nincluding individuals who prepare, approve, sign, \nor submit Rural Health Care Program applica-\ntions, or other forms related to the Rural Health \nCare Program, or who prepare bids, communicate, \nor work with Rural Health Care Program service \n\n85a \nproviders, consultants, or with the Administrator, \nas well as any staff of such entities responsible for \nmonitoring compliance with the Rural Health Care \nProgram; and \n \n(ii) The term \u201cservice provider\u201d includes all in-\ndividuals who are on the governing boards of such \nan entity (such as members of the board of direc-\ntors), and all employees, officers, representatives, \nagents, consultants, or independent contractors of \nsuch entities. \n \n(3) The restrictions set forth in this paragraph \nshall not be applicable to the provision of any gift, gra-\ntuity, favor, entertainment, loan, or any other thing of \nvalue, to the extent given to a family member or a \nfriend working for an eligible health care provider or \nconsortium that includes eligible health care provid-\ners, provided that such transactions: \n \n(i) Are motivated solely by a personal relation-\nship; \n \n(ii) Are not rooted in any service provider busi-\nness activities or any other business relationship \nwith any such eligible health care provider; and \n \n(iii) Are provided using only the donor\u2019s per-\nsonal funds that will not be reimbursed through \nany employment or business relationship. \n \n(4) Any service provider may make charitable do-\nnations to an eligible health care provider or consor-\ntium that includes eligible health care providers in the \nsupport of its programs as long as such contributions \nare not directly or indirectly related to the Rural \nHealth Care Program procurement activities or deci-\nsions and are not given by service providers to circum-\nvent competitive bidding and other Rural Health Care \nProgram rules, including those in \u00a7 54.611(a), \n\n86a \nrequiring health care providers under the Healthcare \nConnect Fund Program to contribute 35 percent of the \ntotal cost of all eligible expenses. \n(i) Exemptions to the competitive bidding re-\nquirements \u2014 \n \n(1) Government Master Service Agreement \n(MSA). Eligible health care providers that seek sup-\nport for services and equipment purchased from MSAs \nnegotiated by federal, state, Tribal, or local govern-\nment entities on behalf of such health care providers \nand others, if such MSAs were awarded pursuant to \napplicable federal, state, Tribal, or local competitive \nbidding requirements, are exempt from the competi-\ntive bidding requirements under this section. \n \n(2) Master Service Agreements approved un-\nder the Rural Health Care Pilot Program or \nHealthcare Connect Fund Program.

Upon approving a requested change, the \nAdministrator will issue a revised funding commit-\nment letter to the health care provider reflecting \n\n88a \nthe changed dates. If the Administrator denies a \nrequested change, it will issue a letter to the health \ncare provider explaining the basis for the denial. \n \n(4) Schools and libraries program master con-\ntracts. Subject to the provisions in \u00a7 54.500, \n\u00a7 54.501(c)(1), and \u00a7 54.503, an eligible health care \nprovider in a consortium with participants in the \nschools and libraries universal service support pro-\ngram and a party to the consortium\u2019s existing contract \nis exempt from the competitive bidding requirements \nif the contract was approved in the schools and librar-\nies universal service support program as a master con-\ntract.

Contributions to the mechanisms begin-\nning April 1, 2003 shall be based on contributors\u2019 pro-\njected collected end-user telecommunications reve-\nnues, and on a contribution factor determined quar-\nterly by the Commission. \n \n(1) For funding the federal universal service sup-\nport mechanisms prior to April 1, 2003, the subject \nrevenues will be contributors\u2019 interstate and interna-\ntional revenues derived from domestic end users for \ntelecommunications or telecommunications services, \nnet of prior period actual contributions. Beginning \nApril 1, 2003, the subject revenues will be contribu-\ntors\u2019 projected collected interstate and international \nrevenues derived from domestic end users for telecom-\nmunications or telecommunications services, net of \nprojected contributions. \n \n(2) Prior to April 1, 2003, the quarterly universal \nservice contribution factor shall be determined by the \nCommission based on the ratio of total projected quar-\nterly expenses of the universal service support mech-\nanisms to the total end-user interstate and interna-\ntional telecommunications revenues, net of prior pe-\nriod actual contributions. Beginning April 1, 2003, the \nquarterly universal service contribution factor shall \nbe determined by the Commission based on the ratio \nof total projected quarterly expenses of the universal \nservice support mechanisms to the total projected \n\n95a \ncollected end-user interstate and international tele-\ncommunications revenues, net of projected contribu-\ntions. The Commission shall approve the Administra-\ntor\u2019s quarterly projected costs of the universal service \nsupport mechanisms, taking into account demand for \nsupport and administrative expenses. The total sub-\nject revenues shall be compiled by the Administrator \nbased on information contained in the Telecommuni-\ncations \nReporting \nWorksheets \ndescribed \nin \n\u00a7 54.711(a). \n \n(3) Total projected expenses for the federal univer-\nsal service support mechanisms for each quarter must \nbe approved by the Commission before they are used \nto calculate the quarterly contribution factor and in-\ndividual contributions. For each quarter, the Admin-\nistrator must submit its projections of demand for the \nfederal universal service support mechanisms for \nhigh-cost areas, low-income consumers, schools and li-\nbraries, and rural health care providers, respectively, \nand the basis for those projections, to the Commission \nand the Office of the Managing Director at least sixty \n(60) calendar days prior to the start of that quarter. \nFor each quarter, the Administrator must submit its \nprojections of administrative expenses for the high-\ncost mechanism, the low-income mechanism, the \nschools and libraries mechanism and the rural health \ncare mechanism and the basis for those projections to \nthe Commission and the Office of the Managing Direc-\ntor at least sixty (60) calendar days prior to the start \nof that quarter. Based on data submitted to the Ad-\nministrator on the Telecommunications Reporting \nWorksheets, the Administrator must submit the total \ncontribution base to the Office of the Managing Direc-\ntor at least thirty (30) days before the start of each \nquarter. The projections of demand and administra-\ntive expenses and the contribution factor shall be \n\n96a \nannounced by the Commission in a public notice and \nshall be made available on the Commission\u2019s website. \nThe Commission reserves the right to set projections \nof demand and administrative expenses at amounts \nthat the Commission determines will serve the public \ninterest at any time within the fourteen-day period \nfollowing release of the Commission\u2019s public notice. If \nthe Commission take no action within fourteen (14) \ndays of the date of release of the public notice an-\nnouncing the projections of demand and administra-\ntive expenses, the projections of demand and admin-\nistrative expenses, and the contribution factor shall be \ndeemed approved by the Commission. Except as pro-\nvided in \u00a7 54.706(c), the Administrator shall apply the \nquarterly contribution factor, once approved by the \nCommission, to contributor\u2019s interstate and interna-\ntional end-user telecommunications revenues to cal-\nculate the amount of individual contributions. \n(b) If the contributions received by the Administrator \nin a quarter exceed the amount of universal service \nsupport program contributions and administrative \ncosts for that quarter, the excess payments will be car-\nried forward to the following quarter. The contribu-\ntion factors for the following quarter will take into \nconsideration the projected costs of the support mech-\nanisms for that quarter and the excess contributions \ncarried over from the previous quarter. The Commis-\nsion may instruct the Administrator to treat excess \ncontributions in a manner other than as prescribed in \nthis paragraph (b). Such instructions may be made in \nthe form of a Commission Order or a public notice re-\nleased by the Wireline Competition Bureau. Any such \npublic notice will become effective fourteen days after \nrelease of the public notice, absent further Commis-\nsion action. \n\n97a \n(c) If the contributions received by the Administrator \nin a quarter are inadequate to meet the amount of uni-\nversal service support program payments and admin-\nistrative costs for that quarter, the Administrator \nshall request authority from the Commission to bor-\nrow funds commercially, with such debt secured by fu-\nture contributions. Subsequent contribution factors \nwill take into consideration the projected costs of the \nsupport mechanisms and the additional costs associ-\nated with borrowing funds. \n(d) If a contributor fails to file a Telecommunications \nReporting Worksheet by the date on which it is due, \nthe Administrator shall bill that contributor based on \nwhatever relevant data the Administrator has availa-\nble, including, but not limited to, the number of lines \npresubscribed to the contributor and data from previ-\nous years, taking into consideration any estimated \nchanges in such data. \n \n \n\n98a \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.711 provides: \nContributor reporting requirements. \n(a) Contributions shall be calculated and filed in ac-\ncordance with the Telecommunications Reporting \nWorksheet which shall be published in the FEDERAL \nREGISTER. The Telecommunications Reporting Work-\nsheet sets forth information that the contributor must \nsubmit to the Administrator on a quarterly and an-\nnual basis. The Commission shall announce by Public \nNotice published in the FEDERAL REGISTER and on its \nwebsite the manner of payment and dates by which \npayments must be made. An executive officer of the \ncontributor must certify to the truth and accuracy of \nhistorical data included in the Telecommunications \nReporting Worksheet, and that any projections in the \nTelecommunications Reporting Worksheet represent \na good-faith estimate based on the contributor\u2019s poli-\ncies and procedures. The Commission or the Adminis-\ntrator may verify any information contained in the \nTelecommunications Reporting Worksheet. Contribu-\ntors shall maintain records and documentation to jus-\ntify information reported in the Telecommunications \nReporting Worksheet, including the methodology \nused to determine projections, for three years and \nshall provide such records and documentation to the \nCommission or the Administrator upon request. Inac-\ncurate or untruthful information contained in the Tel-\necommunications Reporting Worksheet may lead to \nprosecution under the criminal provisions of Title 18 \nof the United States Code. The Administrator shall \nadvise the Commission of any enforcement issues that \narise and provide any suggested response. \n(b) The Commission shall have access to all data re-\nported to the Administrator. Contributors may make \n\n99a \nrequests for Commission nondisclosure of company-\nspecific revenue information under \u00a7 0.459 of this \nchapter by so indicating on the Telecommunications \nReporting Worksheet at the time that the subject data \nare submitted. The Commission shall make all deci-\nsions regarding nondisclosure of company-specific in-\nformation. The Administrator shall keep confidential \nall data obtained from contributors, shall not use such \ndata except for purposes of administering the univer-\nsal service support programs, and shall not disclose \nsuch data in company-specific form unless directed to \ndo so by the Commission. Subject to any restrictions \nimposed by the Chief of the Wireline Competition Bu-\nreau, the Universal Service Administrator may share \ndata obtained from contributors with the administra-\ntors of the North American Numbering Plan admin-\nistration cost recovery (See 47 CFR 52.16 of this chap-\nter), the local number portability cost recovery \n(See 47 CFR 52.32 of this chapter), and the TRS Fund \n(See 47 CFR 64.604(c)(4)(iii)(H) of this chapter). The \nAdministrator shall keep confidential all data ob-\ntained from other administrators and shall not use \nsuch data except for purposes of administering the \nuniversal service support mechanisms. \n(c) The Bureau may waive, reduce, modify, or elimi-\nnate contributor reporting requirements that prove \nunnecessary and require additional reporting require-\nments that the Bureau deems necessary to the sound \nand efficient administration of the universal service \nsupport mechanisms. \n \n \n\n100a \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.717 provides: \nAudits of the Administrator. \nThe Administrator shall obtain and pay for an annual \naudit conducted by an independent auditor to exam-\nine its operations and books of account to determine, \namong other things, whether the Administrator is \nproperly administering the universal service support \nmechanisms to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse: \n(a) Before selecting an independent auditor, the Ad-\nministrator shall submit preliminary audit require-\nments, including the proposed scope of the audit and \nthe extent of compliance and substantive testing, to \nthe Office of Managing Director. \n(b) The Office of Managing Director shall review the \npreliminary audit requirements to determine whether \nthey are adequate to meet the audit objectives. The \nOffice of Managing Director shall prescribe modifica-\ntions that shall be incorporated into the final audit re-\nquirements. \n(c) After the audit requirements have been approved \nby the Office of Managing Director, the Administrator \nshall engage within thirty (30) calendar days an inde-\npendent auditor to conduct the annual audit required \nby this paragraph. In making its selection, the Admin-\nistrator shall not engage any independent auditor who \nhas been involved in designing any of the accounting \nor reporting systems under review in the audit. \n(d) The independent auditor selected by the Adminis-\ntrator to conduct the annual audit shall be instructed \nby the Administrator to develop a detailed audit pro-\ngram based on the final audit requirements and shall \nbe instructed by the Administrator to submit the au-\ndit program to the Office of Managing Director. The \n\n101a \nOffice of Managing Director shall review the audit \nprogram and make modifications, as needed, that \nshall be incorporated into the final audit program. \nDuring the course of the audit, the Office of Managing \nDirector may direct the Administrator to direct the in-\ndependent auditor to take any actions necessary to en-\nsure compliance with the audit requirements. \n(e) During the course of the audit, the Administrator \nshall instruct the independent auditor to: \n \n(1) Inform the Office of Managing Director of any \nrevisions to the final audit program or to the scope of \nthe audit; \n \n(2) Notify the Office of Managing Director of any \nmeetings with the Administrator in which audit find-\nings are discussed; and \n \n(3) Submit to the Chief of the Wireline Competition \nBureau any accounting or rule interpretations neces-\nsary to complete the audit. \n(f) Within 105 calendar days after the end of the audit \nperiod, but prior to discussing the audit findings with \nthe Administrator, the independent auditor shall be \ninstructed by the Administrator to submit a draft of \nthe audit report to the Office of Managing Director \nAudit Staff. \n(g) The Office of Managing Director shall review the \naudit findings and audit workpapers and offer its rec-\nommendations concerning the conduct of the audit or \nthe audit findings to the independent auditor. Excep-\ntions of the Office of Managing Director to the findings \nand conclusions of the independent auditor that re-\nmain unresolved shall be included in the final audit \nreport. \n(h) Within fifteen (15) calendar days after receiving \n\n102a \nthe Office of Managing Director\u2019s recommendations \nand making any revisions to the audit report, the Ad-\nministrator shall instruct the independent auditor to \nsubmit the audit report to the Administrator for its \nresponse to the audit findings. At this time the auditor \nalso must send copies of its audit findings to the Office \nof Managing Director. The Administrator shall pro-\nvide the independent auditor time to perform addi-\ntional audit work recommended by the Office of Man-\naging Director. \n(i) Within thirty (30) calendar days after receiving the \naudit report, the Administrator shall respond to the \naudit findings and send copies of its response to the \nOffice of Managing Director. The Administrator shall \ninstruct the independent auditor that any reply that \nthe independent auditor wishes to make to the Admin-\nistrator\u2019s responses shall be sent to the Office of Man-\naging Director as well as the Administrator. The Ad-\nministrator\u2019s response and the independent auditor\u2019s \nreplies shall be included in the final audit report[.] \n(j) Within ten (10) calendar days after receiving the \nresponse of the Administrator, the independent audi-\ntor shall file with the Commission the final audit re-\nport. \n(k) Based on the final audit report, the Managing Di-\nrector may take any action necessary to ensure that \nthe universal service support mechanisms operate in \na manner consistent with the requirements of this \npart, as well as such other action as is deemed neces-\nsary and in the public interest. \n \n \n\n103a \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.719 provides: \nParties permitted to seek review of Adminis-\ntrator decision. \n(a) Any party aggrieved by an action taken by the Ad-\nministrator, as defined in \u00a7 54.701, \u00a7 54.703, or \n\u00a7 54.705, must first seek review from the Administra-\ntor. \n(b) Any party aggrieved by an action taken by the Ad-\nministrator, after seeking review from the Adminis-\ntrator, may then seek review from the Federal Com-\nmunications Commission, as set forth in \u00a7 54.722. \n(c) Parties seeking waivers of the Commission\u2019s rules \nshall seek relief directly from the Commission. \n \n \n\n104a \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.723 provides: \nStandard of review. \n(a) The Wireline Competition Bureau shall conduct \nde novo review of request for review of decisions issue \nby the Administrator. \n(b) The Federal Communications Commission shall \nconduct de novo review of requests for review of deci-\nsions by the Administrator that involve novel ques-\ntions of fact, law, or policy; provided, however, that the \nCommission shall not conduct de novo review of deci-\nsions issued by the Wireline Competition Bureau un-\nder delegated authority. \n \n \n\n105a \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.801 provides: \nUse of competitive bidding for Rural Digital \nOpportunity Fund. \nThe Commission will use competitive bidding, as pro-\nvided in part 1, subpart AA of this chapter, to deter-\nmine the recipients of Rural Digital Opportunity Fund \nsupport and the amount of support that they may re-\nceive for specific geographic areas, subject to applica-\nble post-auction procedures. \n \n \n\n106a \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.802 provides: \nRural Digital Opportunity Fund geographic ar-\neas, deployment obligations, and support dis-\nbursements. \n(a) Geographic areas eligible for support.

A support recipient\u2019s final service milestones \nwill depend on whether the Wireline Competition Bu-\nreau determines there are more or fewer locations \nthan determined by the Connect America Cost Model \nin the relevant areas as follows: \n \n(i) More Locations. After the Wireline Compe-\ntition Bureau adopts updated location counts, in \nareas where there are more locations than the \nnumber of locations determined by the Connect \nAmerica Cost Model, recipients of Rural Digital \nOpportunity Fund support must complete deploy-\nment to 100 percent of the number of locations de-\ntermined by the Connect America Cost Model by \nthe end of the sixth year. Recipients of Rural \n\n107a \nDigital Opportunity Fund support must then com-\nplete deployment to 100 percent of the additional \nnumber of locations determined by the Wireline \nCompetition Bureau\u2019s updated location count by \nend of the eighth year. If the new location count \nexceeds 35% of the number of locations determined \nby the Connect America Cost Model within their \narea in each state, recipients of Rural Digital Op-\nportunity Fund support will have the opportunity \nto seek additional support or relief. \n \n(ii) Fewer Locations. In areas where there are \nfewer locations than the number of locations deter-\nmined by the Connect America Cost Model, a Rural \nDigital Opportunity Fund support recipient must \nnotify the Wireline Competition Bureau no later \nthan March 1 following the fifth year of deploy-\nment. Upon confirmation by the Wireline Compe-\ntition Bureau, Rural Digital Opportunity Fund \nsupport recipients must complete deployment to \nthe number of locations required by the new loca-\ntion count by the end of the sixth year. Support re-\ncipients for which the new location count is less \nthan 65 percent of the Connect America Cost \nModel locations within their area in each state \nshall have the support amount reduced on a pro \nrata basis by the number of reduced locations. \n \n(iii) Newly Built Locations. In addition to of-\nfering the required service to the updated number \nof locations identified by the Wireline Competition \nBureau, Rural Digital Opportunity Fund support \nrecipients must offer service to locations built since \nthe revised count, upon reasonable request. Sup-\nport recipients are not required to deploy to any lo-\ncation built after milestone year eight. \n\n108a \n(d) Disbursement of Rural Digital Opportunity \nFund funding.

Failure to \ncome into full compliance during the relevant cure \nperiod as described in \u00a7\u00a7 54.320(d)(1)(iv)(B) or \n54.320(d)(2) will trigger a recovery action by the \nUniversal Service Administrative Company as \n\n120a \ndescribed \nin \n\u00a7 54.320(d)(1)(iv)(B) \nor \n\u00a7 54.806(c)(1)(i), as applicable. If the Rural Digital \nOpportunity Fund recipient does not repay the \nrequisite amount of support within six months, the \nUniversal Service Administrative Company will be \nentitled to draw the entire amount of the letter of \ncredit and may disqualify the Rural Digital Oppor-\ntunity Fund support recipient from the receipt of \nRural Digital Opportunity Fund support or addi-\ntional universal service support. \n \n(ii) The default will be evidenced by a letter is-\nsued by the Chief of the Wireline Competition Bu-\nreau, or its respective designees, which letter, at-\ntached to a standby letter of credit draw certificate, \nshall be sufficient for a draw on the standby letter \nof credit for the entire amount of the standby letter \nof credit. \n \n \n\n121a \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.805 provides: \nRural Digital Opportunity Fund public interest \nobligations. \n(a) Recipients of Rural Digital Opportunity Fund sup-\nport are required to offer broadband service with la-\ntency suitable for real-time applications, including \nVoice over internet Protocol, and usage capacity that \nis reasonably comparable to comparable offerings in \nurban areas, at rates that are reasonably comparable \nto rates for comparable offerings in urban areas. For \npurposes of determining reasonable comparable usage \ncapacity, recipients are presumed to meet this re-\nquirement if they meet or exceed the usage level an-\nnounced by public notice issued by the Wireline Com-\npetition Bureau. For purposes of determining reason-\nable comparability of rates, recipients are presumed \nto meet this requirement if they offer rates at or below \nthe applicable benchmark to be announced annually \nby public notice issued by the Wireline Competition \nBureau, or no more than the non-promotional prices \ncharged for a comparable fixed wireline service in ur-\nban areas in the state or U.S. Territory where the eli-\ngible telecommunications carrier receives support. \n(b) Recipients of Rural Digital Opportunity Fund sup-\nport are required to offer broadband service meeting \nthe performance standards for the relevant perfor-\nmance tier. \n \n(1) Rural Digital Opportunity Fund support recip-\nients meeting the minimum performance tier stand-\nards are required to offer broadband service at actual \nspeeds of at least 25 Mbps downstream and 3 Mbps \nupstream and offer a minimum usage allowance of \n250 GB per month, or that reflects the average usage \nof a majority of fixed broadband customers as \n\n122a \nannounced annually by the Wireline Competition Bu-\nreau over the 10-year term. \n \n(2) Rural Digital Opportunity Fund support recip-\nients meeting the above-baseline performance tier \nstandards are required to offer broadband service at \nactual speeds of at least 100 Mbps downstream and \n20 Mbps upstream and offer at least 2 terabytes of \nmonthly usage. \n \n(3) Rural Digital Opportunity Fund support recip-\nients meeting the Gigabit performance tier standards \nare required to offer broadband service at actual \nspeeds of at least 1 Gigabit per second downstream \nand 500 Mbps upstream and offer at least 2 terabytes \nof monthly usage. \n \n(4) For each of the tiers in paragraphs (b)(1) \nthrough (3) of this section, bidders are required to \nmeet one of two latency performance levels: \n \n(i) Low-latency bidders will be required to meet \n95 percent or more of all peak period measure-\nments of network round trip latency at or below \n100 milliseconds; and \n \n(ii) High-latency bidders will be required to \nmeet 95 percent or more of all peak period meas-\nurements of network round trip latency at or below \n750 ms and, with respect to voice performance, \ndemonstrate a score of four or higher using the \nMean Opinion Score (MOS). \n(c) Recipients of Rural Digital Opportunity Fund sup-\nport are required to bid on category one telecommuni-\ncations and internet access services in response to a \nposted FCC Form 470 seeking broadband service that \nmeets the connectivity targets for the schools and li-\nbraries universal service support program for eligible \nschools and libraries (as described in \u00a7 54.501) located \n\n123a \nwithin any area in a census block where the carrier is \nreceiving Rural Digital Opportunity Fund support. \nSuch bids must be at rates reasonably comparable to \nrates charged to eligible schools and libraries in urban \nareas for comparable offerings. \n \n \n\n124a \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.806 provides: \nRural Digital Opportunity Fund reporting obli-\ngations, compliance, and recordkeeping. \n(a) Recipients of Rural Digital Opportunity Fund sup-\nport shall be subject to the reporting obligations set \nforth in \u00a7\u00a7 54.313, 54.314, and 54.316. \n(b) Recipients of Rural Digital Opportunity Fund sup-\nport shall be subject to the compliance measures, \nrecordkeeping requirements and audit requirements \nset forth in \u00a7 54.320(a)-(c). \n(c) Recipients of Rural Digital Opportunity Fund sup-\nport shall be subject to the non-compliance measures \nset forth in \u00a7 54.320(d) subject to the following modi-\nfications related to the recovery of support. \n \n(1) If the support recipient does not report it has \ncome into full compliance after the grace period for its \nsixth year or eighth year service milestone as applica-\nble or if USAC determines in the course of a compli-\nance review that the eligible telecommunications car-\nrier does not have sufficient evidence to demonstrate \nthat it is offering service to all of the locations re-\nquired by the sixth or eighth year service milestone as \nset forth in \u00a7 54.320(d)(3): \n \n(i) Sixth year service milestone. Support will be \nrecovered as follows after the sixth year service \nmilestone grace period or if USAC later determines \nin the course of a compliance review that a support \nrecipient does not have sufficient evidence to \ndemonstrate that it was offering service to all of \nthe locations required by the sixth year service \nmilestone: \n \n(A) If an ETC has deployed to 95 percent or \nmore of the Connect America Cost Model \n\n125a \nlocation count or the adjusted Connect America \nCost Model location count if there are fewer lo-\ncations, but less than 100 percent, USAC will \nrecover an amount of support that is equal to \n1.25 times the average amount of support per \nlocation received in the state for that ETC over \nthe support term for the relevant number of lo-\ncations; \n \n(B) If an ETC has deployed to 90 percent or \nmore of the Connect America Cost Model loca-\ntion count or the adjusted Connect America \nCost Model location count if there are fewer lo-\ncations, but less than 95 percent, USAC will re-\ncover an amount of support that is equal to \n1.5 times the average amount of support per lo-\ncation received in the state for that ETC over \nthe support term for the relevant number of lo-\ncations, plus 5 percent of the support recipient\u2019s \ntotal Rural Digital Opportunity Fund support \nauthorized over the 10-year support term for \nthat state; \n \n(C) If an ETC has deployed to fewer than \n90 percent of the Connect America Cost Model \nlocation count or the adjusted Connect America \nCost Model location count if there are fewer lo-\ncations, USAC will recover an amount of sup-\nport that is equal to 1.75 times the average \namount of support per location received in the \nstate for that ETC over the support term for the \nrelevant number of locations, plus 10 percent of \nthe support recipient\u2019s total Rural Digital Op-\nportunity Fund support authorized over the \n10-year support term for that state. \n \n(ii) Eighth year service milestone. If a Rural \nDigital Opportunity Fund support recipient is \n\n126a \nrequired to serve more new locations than deter-\nmined by the Connect America Cost Model, sup-\nport will be recovered as follows after the eighth \nyear service milestone grace period or if USAC \nlater determines in the course of a compliance re-\nview that a support recipient does not have suffi-\ncient evidence to demonstrate that it was offering \nservice to all of the locations required by the eighth \nyear service milestone: \n \n(A) If an ETC has deployed to 95 percent or \nmore of its new location count, but less than 100 \npercent, USAC will recover an amount of sup-\nport that is equal to the average amount of sup-\nport per location received in the state for that \nETC over the support term for the relevant \nnumber of locations; \n \n(B) If an ETC has deployed to 90 percent or \nmore of its new location count, but less than \n95 percent, USAC will recover an amount of \nsupport that is equal to 1.25 times the average \namount of support per location received in the \nstate for that ETC over the support term for the \nrelevant number of locations; \n \n(C) If an ETC has deployed to 85 percent or \nmore of its new location count, but less than \n90 percent, USAC will recover an amount of \nsupport that is equal to 1.5 times the average \namount of support per location received in the \nstate for that ETC over the support term for the \nrelevant number of locations, plus 5 percent of \nthe support recipient\u2019s total Rural Digital Op-\nportunity Fund support authorized over the \n10-year support term for that state; \n\n127a \n \n(D) If an ETC has deployed to less than \n85 percent of its new location count, USAC will \nrecover an amount of support that is equal to \n1.75 times the average amount of support per \nlocation received in the state for that ETC over \nthe support term for the relevant number of lo-\ncations, plus 10 percent of the support recipi-\nent\u2019s total Rural Digital Opportunity Fund sup-\nport authorized over the 10-year support term \nfor that state. \n \n(2) Any support recipient that believes it cannot \nmeet the third-year service milestone must notify the \nWireline Competition Bureau within 10 business days \nof the third-year service milestone deadline and pro-\nvide information explaining this expected deficiency. \nIf a support recipient has not made such a notification \nby March 1 following the third-year service milestone, \nand has deployed to fewer than 20 percent of the re-\nquired number of locations by the end of the third \nyear, the recipient will immediately be in default and \nsubject to support recovery.

The task EIG is therefore very high, as this information is a cornerstone of the required legal analysis.\n\nFrom a design perspective, this action represents a fundamental and effective strategy: after understanding the case's background and lower court ruling, the next logical step is to analyze the primary arguments of the parties before the Supreme Court. The action's use of specific field filters ('proceeding_title', 'link_name') to precisely target the main brief is also an efficient search technique. While reading the main brief is a standard, almost obvious step, confirming its high utility and practicing efficient retrieval reinforces a core component of a successful legal analysis workflow. The design EIG is moderate because it solidifies a best practice rather than discovering a novel one.",

The Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s March 24, 2023, vacated panel opinion \n(Pet.App.125a) is reported at 63 F.4th 441. \nJURISDICTION \nThis Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1254(1). The en banc Fifth Circuit entered its \njudgment on July 24, 2024. \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \nRespondents in this case (\u201cthe Challengers\u201d) have \nlong contended that the taxing system used to fund \nthe \nUniversal \nService \nFund \n(\u201cUSF\u201d) \nis \nunconstitutional under nondelegation principles. \nIndeed, the Challengers include all petitioners in two \nother cases currently pending before this Court \nraising nondelegation challenges to the USF. See \nConsumers\u2019 Research v. FCC, Nos. 23-456 & 23-743 \n(certiorari denied June 10, 2024; rehearing sought \nJune 18, 2024). Those cases arose out of the Sixth and \nEleventh Circuits, respectively. \nThe en banc Fifth Circuit\u2019s scholarly decision \nbelow adopted the Challengers\u2019 arguments and held \nthe USF funding mechanism violates Article I of the \nU.S. Constitution. As the en banc Fifth Circuit \nexplained, \u201cthere is no record of any government \nprogram like [the] USF in all the U.S. Reports.\u201d \nPet.App.67a. Rather than pay for a multi-billion-\ndollar social welfare program with an appropriation \nfrom \nfederal \nrevenues, \nCongress \nrequires \ntelecommunications carriers to contribute to the USF, \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(d), with carriers passing along a \nportion of that cost to consumers via line-item charges \nin their monthly phone bills, 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.712(a). \nThe collected funds are then redistributed by the \nprivate Universal Service Administrative Company \n(\u201cUSAC\u201d) to entities and projects that ostensibly will \nexpand telecommunications services. 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(b), (e). \n\n3 \n \nBut Congress imposed no formula, ceiling, or other \nmeaningful restrictions on how much money can be \nraised for the USF. To be sure, Congress provided a \nlist of universal service \u201cprinciples.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(b). But they are so amorphous and non-binding \nthat courts\u2014adopting the FCC\u2019s own language\u2014have \nlong labeled them \u201caspirational only,\u201d Tex. Off. of Pub. \nUtil. Couns. v. FCC, 265 F.3d 313, 321 (5th Cir. 2001), \nmeaning Congress \u201csuppl[ied] no principle at all,\u201d \nPet.App.27a. \nIn \naddition, \nCongress \nexpressly \nauthorized the FCC to redefine \u201cuniversal service\u201d and \n\u201cuniversal service principles\u201d as often as it wishes, \ngiving the agency even broader authority to raise \nbillions of dollars in taxes for a program designed to \nbenefit the country more broadly. See 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(b)(7), (c)(1). \nThe FCC then off-loaded authority over the USF to \nUSAC, a private entity of self-described industry \ninsiders with an incentive to push USF charges \nincreasingly higher. Each quarter, USAC exercises its \ndiscretion in determining the desired budget for the \nUSF, which includes the cost of funding USAC itself. \nThe FCC then ministerially converts that figure into \na contribution factor that will apply to certain \ntelecommunications revenues, and that tax rate is \nthen passively \u201cdeemed approved\u201d by the FCC 14 days \nlater, without the FCC ever taking any affirmative \naction or even issuing an approval order. 47 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 54.709(a)(3). There is no evidence the FCC itself \never actually reviews USAC\u2019s work or agrees with \nUSAC\u2019s discretionary decisions about how much \n\n4 \n \nmoney to raise, which is far from a ministerial \nundertaking. \nThis entire process happens only days before the \nnew quarter begins, giving the FCC no real option but \nto accept whatever numbers USAC demands. USAC \nthen collects the forced contributions and chooses how \nto disburse the funds. In essence, a private company \nis taxing Americans in amounts that total billions of \ndollars every year, under penalty of law, without true \ngovernmental accountability. \nThe en banc Fifth Circuit correctly held the USF\u2019s \nrevenue raising is unconstitutional under Article I of \nthe U.S. Constitution. See Pet.App.64a\u201381a. The \ncourt concluded there are \u201cgrave concerns about \n\u00a7 254\u2019s constitutionality under the Supreme Court\u2019s \nnondelegation precedents,\u201d as Congress handed over \nits core legislative taxing power to an agency with \nnothing \nmore \nthan \n\u201c\u2018aspirational\u2019\u201d \nlimits. \nPet.App.28a\u201329a, 42a. The Fifth Circuit also had \n\u201cserious trouble squaring FCC\u2019s subdelegation [to \nUSAC] with Article I, \u00a7 1 of the Constitution.\u201d \nPet.App.54a\u201355a. \nRather than hold independently unconstitutional \nCongress\u2019s delegation to the FCC and the FCC\u2019s \ndelegation to USAC, the Court concluded that the \ncombination \nwas \nunconstitutional. \n\u201c[T]he \nunprecedented nature of the delegation\u201d of broad \ntaxing power from Congress to the FCC, \u201ccombined \nwith other factors\u201d like the FCC\u2019s subsequent \nredelegation to USAC, was more than \u201cenough to hold \n[the USF] unlawful.\u201d Pet.App.42a. \n\n5 \n \nThe dual layers of delegation\u2014from Congress to \nthe FCC, then from the FCC to USAC\u2014\u201cobscure lines \nof accountability the Framers intended to be clear\u201d \nand \u201crender the promise of recourse to the judiciary \nillusory because they give reviewing courts no \nstandard against which to measure the compatibility \nof executive action with the prescriptions of the \npeople\u2019s elected representatives.\u201d Pet.App.75a. \nThe \nFifth \nCircuit \nconcluded: \n\u201cAmerican \ntelecommunications consumers are subject to a \nmultibillion-dollar tax nobody voted for. The size of \nthat tax is de facto determined by a trade group \nstaffed by industry insiders with no semblance of \naccountability to the public. And the trade group in \nturn relies on projections made by its private, for-\nprofit constituent companies, all of which stand to \nprofit \nfrom \nevery \nsingle \ntax \nincrease. \nThis \ncombination of delegations, subdelegations, and \nobfuscations of the USF Tax mechanism offends \nArticle I, \u00a7 1 of the Constitution.\u201d Pet.App.81a. \nConcurring, several judges would have gone \nfurther, explaining that \u201cCongress\u2019s delegation of \nlegislative power to the FCC and the FCC\u2019s delegation \nof the taxing power to a private entity each \nindividually contravene the separation of powers \nprinciple \nthat \nundergirds \nour \nConstitutional \nRepublic.\u201d Pet.App.82a (Elrod, J., joined by Ho & \nEnglehardt, JJ., concurring) (emphasis added). \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision was unsurprising. \nScholars had long flagged these serious constitutional \nflaws with the USF. \u201cUnlike the thousands of \n\n6 \n \nresponsibilities carried out by governmental agencies \non behalf of Congress, this delegation is unique \nbecause of the unfettered power given to the FCC in \ndefining the scope of universal service, and because \nCongress delegated the power to levy a tax to pay for \nthe service with no limits, knowing that the end user, \nthe American public, would ultimately be saddled \nwith the burden.\u201d Barbara A. Cherry & Donald D. \nNystrom, \nUniversal \nService \nContributions: \nAn \nUnconstitutional Delegation of Taxing Power, 2000 L. \nRev. Mich. St. U. Det. C.L. 107, 110. \nSimilarly, former FCC Commissioner Harold \nFurchtgott-Roth has written that the USF charges are \na \u201chidden tax\u201d where \u201c[t]he FCC, by its own logic, [has] \nas much authority to spend $2.25 trillion as it [has] to \nspend $2.25 billion.\u201d Harold W. Furchtgott-Roth, A \nTough Act to Follow? at 62, 72 (2006). \nThe Challengers consented to the government\u2019s \nrequest to stay the Fifth Circuit\u2019s mandate, on \ncondition that the government file its petition for a \nwrit of certiorari by September 30, 2024. The Fifth \nCircuit granted the government\u2019s request. See Order, \nConsumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, No. 22-60008 (5th Cir. Aug. \n26, 2024), ECF No. 349-2. \nDISCUSSION \nAs noted above, the Challengers filed petitions for \nwrits of certiorari from decisions by the Sixth and \nEleventh Circuits, which rejected the Challengers\u2019 \nnondelegation claims. See Consumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, \nNos. 23-456 & 23-743. The Challengers have sought \n\n7 \n \nrehearing of this Court\u2019s June 2024 denial of those \npetitions. Id. Those rehearing petitions remain \npending. \nGiven their own pending requests for this Court\u2019s \nreview of those adverse rulings, the Challengers agree \nthe constitutionality of the USF funding mechanism \nwarrants this Court\u2019s review. There is also now a \ncircuit split on whether that funding mechanism \nviolates nondelegation principles. \nTime is of the essence because the government \ncontinues to collect funds for the USF despite the \nFifth Circuit\u2019s holding below, as the Fifth Circuit \nagreed to stay its mandate on condition that the \ngovernment file its petition for a writ of certiorari by \nSeptember 30, 2024. See Order, Consumers\u2019 Rsch., No. \n22-60008 (5th Cir. Aug. 26, 2024). \nGiven the time sensitivity, the Court should grant \nthe petitions for rehearing and certiorari in Nos. 23-\n456 and 23-743, which are already fully briefed, and \nthus merits briefing can begin immediately. The \nCourt could then either consolidate all three cases, or \nhold this case pending a decision in Nos. 23-456 and \n23-743. \nThe Court should realign the parties for any \nconsolidated proceedings so the Challengers are \ntreated as petitioners, given that they first sought this \nCourt\u2019s review on these issues and have been \npetitioners in all lower-court proceedings. The Court \nhas previously realigned the parties in cases raising \nthe same issue, consistent with the parties\u2019 status in \n\n8 \n \nthe earlier-filed case. See, e.g., Axon Enter., Inc. v. \nFTC, No. 21-86 & SEC v. Cochran, No. 21-1239 \n(realigned parties so the Government was treated as \nrespondent in both cases); AMG Capital Mgmt., LLC \nv. FTC, No. 19-508 & FTC v. Credit Bureau Ctr., LLC, \nNo. 19-825 (similar). The Court has also previously \ngranted rehearing and then consolidated several \npending cases for merits briefing and argument. See, \ne.g., Al Odah v. United States, No. 06-1196 & \nBoumediene v. Bush, No. 06-1195. \n \n \n\n9 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe petitions for rehearing and for writs of \ncertiorari in Nos. 23-456 and 23-743 should be \ngranted. If the Court grants this case (No. 24-354), \ntoo, it should either hold it pending a decision in Nos. \n23-456 and 23-743, or consolidate the three cases and \nrealign the parties here so the Challengers are treated \nas petitioners. \nROBERT HENNEKE \nCHANCE WELDON \nTEXAS PUBLIC POLICY \nFOUNDATION \n901 Congress Avenue \nAustin, TX 78701 \n(512) 472-2700 \nrhenneke@texaspolicy.com \n \nR.

The Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s March 24, 2023, vacated panel opinion \n(Pet.App.125a) is reported at 63 F.4th 441. \nJURISDICTION \nThis Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1254(1). The en banc Fifth Circuit entered its \njudgment on July 24, 2024. \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \nRespondents in this case (\u201cthe Challengers\u201d) have \nlong contended that the taxing system used to fund \nthe \nUniversal \nService \nFund \n(\u201cUSF\u201d) \nis \nunconstitutional under nondelegation principles. \nIndeed, the Challengers include all petitioners in two \nother cases currently pending before this Court \nraising nondelegation challenges to the USF. See \nConsumers\u2019 Research v. FCC, Nos. 23-456 & 23-743 \n(certiorari denied June 10, 2024; rehearing sought \nJune 18, 2024). Those cases arose out of the Sixth and \nEleventh Circuits, respectively. \nThe en banc Fifth Circuit\u2019s scholarly decision \nbelow adopted the Challengers\u2019 arguments and held \nthe USF funding mechanism violates Article I of the \nU.S. Constitution. As the en banc Fifth Circuit \nexplained, \u201cthere is no record of any government \nprogram like [the] USF in all the U.S. Reports.\u201d \nPet.App.67a. Rather than pay for a multi-billion-\ndollar social welfare program with an appropriation \nfrom \nfederal \nrevenues, \nCongress \nrequires \ntelecommunications carriers to contribute to the USF, \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(d), with carriers passing along a \nportion of that cost to consumers via line-item charges \nin their monthly phone bills, 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.712(a). \nThe collected funds are then redistributed by the \nprivate Universal Service Administrative Company \n(\u201cUSAC\u201d) to entities and projects that ostensibly will \nexpand telecommunications services. 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(b), (e). \n\n3 \n \nBut Congress imposed no formula, ceiling, or other \nmeaningful restrictions on how much money can be \nraised for the USF. To be sure, Congress provided a \nlist of universal service \u201cprinciples.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(b). But they are so amorphous and non-binding \nthat courts\u2014adopting the FCC\u2019s own language\u2014have \nlong labeled them \u201caspirational only,\u201d Tex. Off. of Pub. \nUtil. Couns. v. FCC, 265 F.3d 313, 321 (5th Cir. 2001), \nmeaning Congress \u201csuppl[ied] no principle at all,\u201d \nPet.App.27a. \nIn \naddition, \nCongress \nexpressly \nauthorized the FCC to redefine \u201cuniversal service\u201d and \n\u201cuniversal service principles\u201d as often as it wishes, \ngiving the agency even broader authority to raise \nbillions of dollars in taxes for a program designed to \nbenefit the country more broadly. See 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(b)(7), (c)(1). \nThe FCC then off-loaded authority over the USF to \nUSAC, a private entity of self-described industry \ninsiders with an incentive to push USF charges \nincreasingly higher. Each quarter, USAC exercises its \ndiscretion in determining the desired budget for the \nUSF, which includes the cost of funding USAC itself. \nThe FCC then ministerially converts that figure into \na contribution factor that will apply to certain \ntelecommunications revenues, and that tax rate is \nthen passively \u201cdeemed approved\u201d by the FCC 14 days \nlater, without the FCC ever taking any affirmative \naction or even issuing an approval order. 47 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 54.709(a)(3). There is no evidence the FCC itself \never actually reviews USAC\u2019s work or agrees with \nUSAC\u2019s discretionary decisions about how much \n\n4 \n \nmoney to raise, which is far from a ministerial \nundertaking. \nThis entire process happens only days before the \nnew quarter begins, giving the FCC no real option but \nto accept whatever numbers USAC demands. USAC \nthen collects the forced contributions and chooses how \nto disburse the funds. In essence, a private company \nis taxing Americans in amounts that total billions of \ndollars every year, under penalty of law, without true \ngovernmental accountability. \nThe en banc Fifth Circuit correctly held the USF\u2019s \nrevenue raising is unconstitutional under Article I of \nthe U.S. Constitution. See Pet.App.64a\u201381a. The \ncourt concluded there are \u201cgrave concerns about \n\u00a7 254\u2019s constitutionality under the Supreme Court\u2019s \nnondelegation precedents,\u201d as Congress handed over \nits core legislative taxing power to an agency with \nnothing \nmore \nthan \n\u201c\u2018aspirational\u2019\u201d \nlimits. \nPet.App.28a\u201329a, 42a. The Fifth Circuit also had \n\u201cserious trouble squaring FCC\u2019s subdelegation [to \nUSAC] with Article I, \u00a7 1 of the Constitution.\u201d \nPet.App.54a\u201355a. \nRather than hold independently unconstitutional \nCongress\u2019s delegation to the FCC and the FCC\u2019s \ndelegation to USAC, the Court concluded that the \ncombination \nwas \nunconstitutional. \n\u201c[T]he \nunprecedented nature of the delegation\u201d of broad \ntaxing power from Congress to the FCC, \u201ccombined \nwith other factors\u201d like the FCC\u2019s subsequent \nredelegation to USAC, was more than \u201cenough to hold \n[the USF] unlawful.\u201d Pet.App.42a. \n\n5 \n \nThe dual layers of delegation\u2014from Congress to \nthe FCC, then from the FCC to USAC\u2014\u201cobscure lines \nof accountability the Framers intended to be clear\u201d \nand \u201crender the promise of recourse to the judiciary \nillusory because they give reviewing courts no \nstandard against which to measure the compatibility \nof executive action with the prescriptions of the \npeople\u2019s elected representatives.\u201d Pet.App.75a. \nThe \nFifth \nCircuit \nconcluded: \n\u201cAmerican \ntelecommunications consumers are subject to a \nmultibillion-dollar tax nobody voted for. The size of \nthat tax is de facto determined by a trade group \nstaffed by industry insiders with no semblance of \naccountability to the public. And the trade group in \nturn relies on projections made by its private, for-\nprofit constituent companies, all of which stand to \nprofit \nfrom \nevery \nsingle \ntax \nincrease. \nThis \ncombination of delegations, subdelegations, and \nobfuscations of the USF Tax mechanism offends \nArticle I, \u00a7 1 of the Constitution.\u201d Pet.App.81a. \nConcurring, several judges would have gone \nfurther, explaining that \u201cCongress\u2019s delegation of \nlegislative power to the FCC and the FCC\u2019s delegation \nof the taxing power to a private entity each \nindividually contravene the separation of powers \nprinciple \nthat \nundergirds \nour \nConstitutional \nRepublic.\u201d Pet.App.82a (Elrod, J., joined by Ho & \nEnglehardt, JJ., concurring) (emphasis added). \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision was unsurprising. \nScholars had long flagged these serious constitutional \nflaws with the USF. \u201cUnlike the thousands of \n\n6 \n \nresponsibilities carried out by governmental agencies \non behalf of Congress, this delegation is unique \nbecause of the unfettered power given to the FCC in \ndefining the scope of universal service, and because \nCongress delegated the power to levy a tax to pay for \nthe service with no limits, knowing that the end user, \nthe American public, would ultimately be saddled \nwith the burden.\u201d Barbara A. Cherry & Donald D. \nNystrom, \nUniversal \nService \nContributions: \nAn \nUnconstitutional Delegation of Taxing Power, 2000 L. \nRev. Mich. St. U. Det. C.L. 107, 110. \nSimilarly, former FCC Commissioner Harold \nFurchtgott-Roth has written that the USF charges are \na \u201chidden tax\u201d where \u201c[t]he FCC, by its own logic, [has] \nas much authority to spend $2.25 trillion as it [has] to \nspend $2.25 billion.\u201d Harold W. Furchtgott-Roth, A \nTough Act to Follow? at 62, 72 (2006). \nThe Challengers consented to the government\u2019s \nrequest to stay the Fifth Circuit\u2019s mandate, on \ncondition that the government file its petition for a \nwrit of certiorari by September 30, 2024. The Fifth \nCircuit granted the government\u2019s request. See Order, \nConsumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, No. 22-60008 (5th Cir. Aug. \n26, 2024), ECF No. 349-2. \nDISCUSSION \nAs noted above, the Challengers filed petitions for \nwrits of certiorari from decisions by the Sixth and \nEleventh Circuits, which rejected the Challengers\u2019 \nnondelegation claims. See Consumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, \nNos. 23-456 & 23-743. The Challengers have sought \n\n7 \n \nrehearing of this Court\u2019s June 2024 denial of those \npetitions. Id. Those rehearing petitions remain \npending. \nGiven their own pending requests for this Court\u2019s \nreview of those adverse rulings, the Challengers agree \nthe constitutionality of the USF funding mechanism \nwarrants this Court\u2019s review. There is also now a \ncircuit split on whether that funding mechanism \nviolates nondelegation principles. \nTime is of the essence because the government \ncontinues to collect funds for the USF despite the \nFifth Circuit\u2019s holding below, as the Fifth Circuit \nagreed to stay its mandate on condition that the \ngovernment file its petition for a writ of certiorari by \nSeptember 30, 2024. See Order, Consumers\u2019 Rsch., No. \n22-60008 (5th Cir. Aug. 26, 2024). \nGiven the time sensitivity, the Court should grant \nthe petitions for rehearing and certiorari in Nos. 23-\n456 and 23-743, which are already fully briefed, and \nthus merits briefing can begin immediately. The \nCourt could then either consolidate all three cases, or \nhold this case pending a decision in Nos. 23-456 and \n23-743. \nThe Court should realign the parties for any \nconsolidated proceedings so the Challengers are \ntreated as petitioners, given that they first sought this \nCourt\u2019s review on these issues and have been \npetitioners in all lower-court proceedings. The Court \nhas previously realigned the parties in cases raising \nthe same issue, consistent with the parties\u2019 status in \n\n8 \n \nthe earlier-filed case. See, e.g., Axon Enter., Inc. v. \nFTC, No. 21-86 & SEC v. Cochran, No. 21-1239 \n(realigned parties so the Government was treated as \nrespondent in both cases); AMG Capital Mgmt., LLC \nv. FTC, No. 19-508 & FTC v. Credit Bureau Ctr., LLC, \nNo. 19-825 (similar). The Court has also previously \ngranted rehearing and then consolidated several \npending cases for merits briefing and argument. See, \ne.g., Al Odah v. United States, No. 06-1196 & \nBoumediene v. Bush, No. 06-1195. \n \n \n\n9 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe petitions for rehearing and for writs of \ncertiorari in Nos. 23-456 and 23-743 should be \ngranted. If the Court grants this case (No. 24-354), \ntoo, it should either hold it pending a decision in Nos. \n23-456 and 23-743, or consolidate the three cases and \nrealign the parties here so the Challengers are treated \nas petitioners. \nROBERT HENNEKE \nCHANCE WELDON \nTEXAS PUBLIC POLICY \nFOUNDATION \n901 Congress Avenue \nAustin, TX 78701 \n(512) 472-2700 \nrhenneke@texaspolicy.com \n \nR.
