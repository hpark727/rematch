    "facts_of_the_case": "In 2012, Danny Rivers was convicted in Texas state court of multiple charges related to sexual abuse of a child and possession of child pornography. He filed his first federal habeas petition in August 2017 challenging these convictions, which was denied by the district court in September 2018. While his appeal of that denial was pending, Rivers filed a second habeas petition in February 2021 raising new claims after obtaining his attorney-client file through a state bar grievance in October 2019. The district court deemed this second petition \u201csuccessive\u201d under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d) and transferred it to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit for authorization, but Rivers failed to file the required motion for authorization. After the Fifth Circuit ultimately affirmed the denial of his first petition in May 2022, Rivers appealed the transfer order of his second petition, arguing that it should have been treated as a motion to amend his first petition rather than as a successive petition since his first petition was still pending when he filed the second one.\n\nThe Fifth Circuit disagreed and affirmed the district court\u2019s dismissal of Rivers\u2019s second-in-time petition for lack of jurisdiction.",

This document is the single most important source for understanding the petitioner's arguments and the reasons the Court might take the case (like a circuit split). By creating this specific plan, the action significantly reduces uncertainty about how to proceed and makes the subsequent information-gathering action much more likely to be successful. \n\nDesign EIG (0.8): This action exemplifies a cornerstone strategy for SCOTUS case analysis: 'start with the cert petition.' This is a highly effective and generalizable heuristic. By explicitly stating the need to find the petitioner's arguments, the alleged lower court error, and potential circuit splits, the thought process models an expert approach to legal prediction. Validating this as a primary step is highly valuable for refining the agent's overall design and strategy for any case.\n\nJoint EIG (1.4): The action provides significant value by creating a well-defined plan for the specific task while simultaneously demonstrating a robust, reusable methodological principle. It's a strong example of effective reasoning that bridges the gap between understanding the current problem and improving the general problem-solving approach.",

This is foundational information, making the Task EIG extremely high. Without it, any prediction would be based on an incomplete summary. For Design EIG, this action reinforces a core principle of effective legal prediction: always start by analyzing the primary documents that frame the legal dispute.

Davis, 590 U.S. \n504, 509 (2020). After that, the stringent gatekeeping \nrequirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2) bar nearly all \nattempts to file a \u201csecond or successive habeas corpus \napplication.\u201d Here, petitioner sought to amend his in-\nitial habeas application while it was pending on ap-\npeal. The Fifth Circuit applied \u00a7 2244(b)(2) and re-\njected the amended filing. \nThe circuits are intractably split on whether \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies to such filings. The Fifth, Sixth, \nSeventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits hold \nthat \u00a7 2244(b)(2) categorically applies to all second-\nin-time habeas filings made after the district court \nenters final judgment. The Second Circuit disagrees, \napplying \u00a7 2244(b)(2) only after a petitioner exhausts \nappellate review of his initial petition. And the Third \nand Tenth Circuits exempt some second-in-time fil-\nings from \u00a7 2244(b)(2), depending on whether a pris-\noner prevails on his initial appeal (Third Circuit) or \nsatisfies a seven-factor test (Tenth Circuit). \nThe question presented is: \nWhether \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies (i) only to habeas fil-\nings made after a prisoner has exhausted appellate \nreview of his first petition, (ii) to all second-in-time \nhabeas filings after final judgment, or (iii) to some \nsecond-in-time filings, depending on a prisoner\u2019s suc-\ncess on appeal or ability to satisfy a seven-factor test. \n \n\nii \n \nRELATED PROCEEDINGS \nEx parte Rivers, WR-84,550-01 & 84,550-02 (Tex. \nCt.

Nine cir-\ncuits have split four ways over that question, and on-\nly this Court can resolve the conflict. \n1. This case is about the hurdles that a prisoner \nmust clear before a court will hear him out. Petitioner \nDanny Rivers sought habeas relief, arguing that his \ncounsel had failed to investigate his case and had \nshown up to trial drunk. The district court denied the \npetition, finding that Rivers couldn\u2019t explain what his \nlawyer should have done differently or why that \nwould have changed things. But the answer soon \nemerged. After fighting for years to obtain his coun-\nsel\u2019s records, Rivers finally received them while his \ninitial petition was up on appeal. Among the files, \nRivers found an exculpatory report suggesting that \nhe was wrongly convicted\u2014evidence that his lawyers \nnever once mentioned at trial.  \nNew evidence in hand, Rivers raced to court\u2014only \nto find the doors barred. Applying \u00a7 2244(b)(2), the \ndistrict court reasoned that it was \u201cwithout jurisdic-\ntion to entertain\u201d the new evidence because Rivers\u2019s \nfiling counted as a \u201csecond or successive\u201d petition. \nPet. App. 19a. (Never mind that his first petition was \nstill pending on appeal and would be for nearly a \nyear.) The Fifth Circuit affirmed, explaining that \u201cfil-\nings introduced after a final judgment that raise ha-\nbeas claims\u201d are \u201cdeemed successive.\u201d Pet. App. 10a. \n\n2 \n \n \n2. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision deepens a circuit con-\nflict over when \u00a7 2244(b)(2) kicks in. In the Second \nCircuit, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) doesn\u2019t apply until a prisoner \nhas exhausted appellate review of his initial habeas \npetition\u2014leaving district courts free to consider a fil-\ning like Rivers\u2019s. As then-Judge Sotomayor put it, \nthat approach guarantees \u201cone full opportunity to \nseek collateral review.\u201d Ching v. United States, 298 \nF.3d 174, 177 (2d Cir. 2002). But the Fifth Circuit ex-\npressly \u201cdecline[d] \u2026 to embrace\u201d that rule. Pet. App. \n10a. Instead, it joined the Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, \nNinth, and Eleventh Circuits in applying \u00a7 2244(b)(2) \nafter the district court enters final judgment. That \napproach effectively grants \u201cone full opportunity to \nseek collateral review in the district court.\u201d United \nStates v. Santarelli, 929 F.3d 95, 104 (3d Cir. 2019) \n(cleaned up). Meanwhile, the Third and Tenth Cir-\ncuits follow their own unique approaches, holding \nthat \u00a7 2244(b)(2) sometimes applies between final \njudgment and exhaustion and sometimes doesn\u2019t. \nThree circuits have already denied rehearing en banc, \nand the rest show no sign of rethinking their views. \nIn short: the circuits are intractably split, the con-\nflict won\u2019t disappear on its own, and this Court\u2019s \nguidance is badly needed. See Balbuena v. Sullivan, \n970 F.3d 1176, 1197, 1200 (9th Cir. 2020) (Fletcher, \nJ., concurring in the result) (\u201curg[ing] the Supreme \nCourt to recognize\u201d and \u201cresolve the conflict\u201d).  \n3. The decision below is also wrong. In Banister v. \nDavis, 590 U.S. 504 (2020), this Court explained that \nthe phrase \u201csecond or successive\u201d is a term of art that \ndoesn\u2019t simply refer to every second-in-time habeas \nfiling. Instead, the Court has looked to historical \npractice and statutory aims when determining \nwhether \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies. But the Fifth Circuit \n\n3 \n \n \ndidn\u2019t even cite Banister, let alone follow its guidance. \nHad it done so, the court would have realized that its \nrule doesn\u2019t square with history. Early courts analyz-\ning abuses of the writ treated appellate review\u2014not \nfinal judgment\u2014as the relevant inflection point. \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s approach will also frustrate \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2)\u2019s aims. At bottom, the question is not \nwhether prisoners like Rivers will try to bring new \nevidence to the courts\u2019 attention. (They will\u2014no mat-\nter what rule this Court adopts.) The question in-\nstead is which court will consider that evidence first. \nUnder the Second Circuit\u2019s approach, a filing like \nRivers\u2019s would have gone to the district court that \njust denied the initial petition: the single member of \nArticle III most familiar with the case. That judge \ncould then have weighed the new evidence and decid-\ned whether to issue an indicative ruling under Feder-\nal Rule of Civil Procedure 62.1. By contrast, the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s rule requires Rivers to ask a brand-new \nthree-judge panel for permission to ask the district \ncourt to consider whether or not to reach the merits. \nIt\u2019s hard to squeeze that rule from the statutory \ntext\u2014and harder still to attribute it to a Congress fo-\ncused on judicial economy, efficiency, and finality. \n4. The question presented is important, and this \ncase is an ideal vehicle. Until this Court weighs in, at \nleast some states and prisoners will be living under \nthe wrong rule, and those in the outstanding circuits \nwill have to guess which rule applies. The interests \non both sides are too critical to leave up to geograph-\nical chance. The split is also outcome-determinative \nhere: if Rivers were incarcerated in New York instead \nof Texas, courts would have considered the new evi-\ndence, giving him a meaningful path to relief. \nThe Court should grant review. \n\n4 \n \n \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe court of appeals\u2019 opinion is reported at 99 F.4th \n216 and is reproduced in the appendix to this petition \nat Pet. App. 1a\u201311a. The district court\u2019s opinion is \nunpublished but is available at 2021 WL 4319670 and \nis reproduced at Pet. App. 12a\u201317a. \nJURISDICTION \nThe Fifth Circuit issued its judgment on April 15, \n2024. Pet. App. 1a. This Court has jurisdiction under \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISION INVOLVED \nSection 2244(b)(2) of Title 28, U.S. Code, provides: \nA claim presented in a second or successive ha-\nbeas corpus application under section 2254 that \nwas not presented in a prior application shall be \ndismissed unless\u2014 \n(A) the applicant shows that the claim relies on \na new rule of constitutional law, made retroac-\ntive to cases on collateral review by the Su-\npreme Court, that was previously unavailable; \nor \n(B)(i) the factual predicate for the claim could \nnot have been discovered previously through \nthe exercise of due diligence; and \n(ii) the facts underlying the claim, if proven \nand viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, \nwould be sufficient to establish by clear and \nconvincing evidence that, but for constitutional \nerror, no reasonable factfinder would have \nfound the applicant guilty of the underlying of-\nfense. \n\n5 \n \n \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal background \n1. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty \nAct of 1996 creates a dual-track system for federal \nhabeas relief. One path is for first-time petitioners. \n\u201cUnder AEDPA, a state prisoner always gets one \nchance to bring a federal habeas challenge to his con-\nviction.\u201d Banister v. Davis, 590 U.S. 504, 509 (2020). \nThis path begins in the district court. If that court \ndenies relief, the prisoner may request a \u201ccertificate \nof appealability\u201d\u2014initially from the district court, \nand then from the court of appeals. See Gonzalez v. \nThaler, 565 U.S. 134, 140 & n.5 (2012). The path ends \nonly when the prisoner has exhausted the chance to \nappeal and seek certiorari. \nThe second path is \u201crockier.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at \n509. A prisoner who wants to file a \u201csecond or succes-\nsive \nhabeas \ncorpus \napplication,\u201d \n28 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2), must first ask the court of appeals for \n\u201can order authorizing the district court to consider \nthe application,\u201d id. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). The appellate \ncourt may oblige only if the prisoner makes a \u201cprima \nfacie showing,\u201d id. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(C), that the petition \n\u201crelies on a new and retroactive rule of constitutional \nlaw\u201d or \u201calleges previously undiscoverable facts that \nwould establish \u2026 innocence,\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at \n509 (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2)). If so, the petition \ngoes to the district court, which must decide for itself \nwhether the petition \u201csatisfies the requirements\u201d of \n\u00a7 2244. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(4). At the same time, be-\ncause any claim \u201cpresented in a prior application\u201d \nmust be dismissed, \u00a7 2244(b)(1), both courts must \ncarefully compare the new petition to all prior peti-\ntions to determine precisely what \u201cclaims\u201d the prison-\n\n6 \n \n \ner has brought. Only then\u2014after all that is done\u2014\nmay the district court reach the merits. \nThe upshot is that much rides on whether \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies\u2014that is: on whether a filing is \ndeemed \u201cpart and parcel of the first habeas proceed-\ning,\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 507, or instead a \u201csecond \nor successive habeas corpus application,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2).  \n2. The phrase \u201csecond or successive\u201d is a \u201cterm of \nart\u201d that does not refer simply to \u201call habeas filings \u2026 \nfollowing an initial application.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at \n511 (first quoting Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, \n486 (2000), then quoting Magwood, 561 U.S. at 332 \n(2010)). To determine when \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies, \u201cthis \nCourt has looked for guidance in two main places.\u201d \nId. at 512. First, the Court has considered history: \n\u201cwhether a type of later-in-time filing would have \nconstituted an abuse of the writ\u201d under the Court\u2019s  \n\u201cpre-AEDPA cases.\u201d Id. (cleaned up) (quoting Panetti \nv. Quarterman, 551 U.S. 930, 947 (2007)). Second, the \nCourt has looked to \u201cAEDPA\u2019s own purposes\u201d: con-\nserving judicial resources, reducing piecemeal litiga-\ntion, and achieving finality \u201cwithin a reasonable \ntime.\u201d Id. (citing Panetti, 551 U.S. at 945\u201346). \nB. Factual and procedural background \nDanny Rivers has spent the last twelve years \nfighting to prove his innocence. Along the way, he \ndiscovered that exculpatory evidence had been sitting \nin his trial counsel\u2019s files all the while\u2014evidence that \nhis lawyers could have used to clear his name. If Riv-\ners is right, then he not only received ineffective as-\nsistance but was also wrongly convicted. This case is \nabout the procedural hurdles that Rivers must clear \nbefore a court will hear him out. \n\n7 \n \n \n1. Rivers is tried and convicted \nIn 2012, a Texas jury convicted Rivers of sexually \nabusing his children and possessing child pornogra-\nphy. He is currently serving a 38-year sentence. \na. This case began amidst a bitter divorce. In 2008, \na Texas judge awarded Rivers temporary custody of \nhis 9-year-old daughter. Rivers v. Lumpkin, No. 7:21-\ncv-00012 (N.D. Tex.), Dkt. 11-14 (\u201cR-1\u201d), at 156, 164. \nThe court also granted Rivers sole use of the family \nhome, ordered his ex-wife to pay child support, and \ndenied her request for alimony. Id. Dkt. 11-15 (\u201cR-2\u201d), \nat 15. In response, Rivers\u2019s ex-wife \u201cpunish[ed]\u201d him \nby \u201cnot letting him see\u201d his 12-year-old stepdaughter, \nwhom he had raised as his own. R-2, at 16. \nThe following year, with custody arrangements un-\nchanged, Rivers\u2019s ex-wife drove the children to the \npolice station while Rivers was away for work. Both \ngirls met with officers and accused Rivers of sexually \nabusing them. R-2, at 18, 129. Police then searched \nRivers\u2019s home, seized the family laptop, and launched \na monthslong forensic examination, eventually identi-\nfying \u201ctwo files of interest\u201d that \u201cappeared to be child \npornography.\u201d Id. at 26, 28; id. Dkt. 11-10 (\u201cR-3\u201d), at \n13, 31, 73; id. Dkt. 11-16, at 15, 66\u201367. \nb. A Wichita County, Texas grand jury indicted \nRivers for continuous sexual abuse, indecency with a \nchild, and two counts of possessing child pornogra-\nphy. R-3, at 8\u201315. Rivers, who had no prior criminal \nhistory, R-2, at 161, pleaded not guilty. \nWith his trial looming, Rivers moved to sever the \nchild-pornography counts, arguing that they might \ncolor the jury\u2019s views on the other charges. R-1, at 15. \nThe state opposed severance. Because its case had \n\u201cno DNA or physical evidence,\u201d Texas argued that the \n\n8 \n \n \nalleged child pornography was \u201cnecessary\u201d to estab-\nlish Rivers\u2019s \u201cmotive\u201d and \u201cattraction to young girls.\u201d \nId. at 14\u201315. The court refused to sever. Id. at 23. \nc. At trial, Rivers\u2019s daughter and stepdaughter al-\nleged a staggering pattern of sexual abuse. R-1, at \n142, 145\u2013146, 167\u2013168. They further claimed that \nRivers had shown them child pornography at least \nseventy times, testifying that he had \u201cdownloaded \nmultiple videos\u201d and played different films on differ-\nent occasions. Id. at 153, 172. Rivers\u2019s daughter also \naccused her father of secretly recording images in the \nshower. R-1, at 170. (No hidden cameras were ever \nfound.) All told, the girls alleged over 200 instances of \nshocking abuse, many of which reportedly took place \nin common areas of the home while their mother, un-\ncle, or cousin were also present in the house. R-1, at \n139, 147, 152\u201353, 156, 158, 166; R-2, at 12, 90. No \nother witnesses saw the alleged abuse, and no physi-\ncal evidence corroborated the story. R-2, at 34, 64. \nGiven the lack of supporting evidence, the alleged \nchild pornography was a key issue at trial. The prose-\ncution called multiple witnesses to testify about the \ntwo files\u2014a single image and a single video\u2014that \nRivers was charged with possessing. R-2, at 19, 28, \n44, 74, 84, 100. While the trial judge had granted a \ncontinuance so the defense could obtain its own fo-\nrensic experts, R-3, at 31, 40, counsel did not do so. \nR-2, at 112. Instead, the defense called only a single \nwitness, who testified that Rivers was out of town \nwhen the files were allegedly downloaded. R-2, at \n113\u2013114, 131. \nd. The jury convicted Rivers on all charges, Pet. \nApp. 2a. It rejected the prosecution\u2019s call for a 169-\nyear sentence, however, and recommended that the \ncourt sentence Rivers to 42 years instead. R-3, at \n\n9 \n \n \n213\u201314, 221\u201329. The court went lower still: 38 years \nbehind bars, all counts considered\u2014just three years \nabove the minimum. Pet. App. 13a. The Texas Court \nof Appeals affirmed. \n2. Rivers seeks postconviction relief \na. In 2013, Rivers began asking his lawyers to send \nhim his client file. He explained: \u201cI don\u2019t know what \nall it contains, but it looks like I\u2019m going to have to do \nthis thing pro se, so I need everything I can get.\u201d \nNo. 7:21-cv-00012 (N.D. Tex.) Dkt. 15-11, at 67. \nCounsel \u201cnever responded to [his] request,\u201d and two \nyears later, Rivers was still trying. Id. at 68\u201369. He \neventually resorted to filing a formal grievance with \nthe Texas state bar. \nMeanwhile, Rivers pressed forward with what rec-\nords he had. In 2016, he sought state postconviction \nrelief based on ineffective assistance, among other \ngrounds. Relevant here, he argued that his trial \ncounsel had failed to \u201cper\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Davis, 590 U.S. \n504, 509 (2020). After that, the stringent gatekeeping \nrequirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2) bar nearly all \nattempts to file a \u201csecond or successive habeas corpus \napplication.\u201d Here, petitioner sought to amend his in-\nitial habeas application while it was pending on ap-\npeal. The Fifth Circuit applied \u00a7 2244(b)(2) and re-\njected the amended filing. \nThe circuits are intractably split on whether \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies to such filings. The Fifth, Sixth, \nSeventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits hold \nthat \u00a7 2244(b)(2) categorically applies to all second-\nin-time habeas filings made after the district court \nenters final judgment. The Second Circuit disagrees, \napplying \u00a7 2244(b)(2) only after a petitioner exhausts \nappellate review of his initial petition. And the Third \nand Tenth Circuits exempt some second-in-time fil-\nings from \u00a7 2244(b)(2), depending on whether a pris-\noner prevails on his initial appeal (Third Circuit) or \nsatisfies a seven-factor test (Tenth Circuit). \nThe question presented is: \nWhether \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies (i) only to habeas fil-\nings made after a prisoner has exhausted appellate \nreview of his first petition, (ii) to all second-in-time \nhabeas filings after final judgment, or (iii) to some \nsecond-in-time filings, depending on a prisoner\u2019s suc-\ncess on appeal or ability to satisfy a seven-factor test. \n \n\nii \n \nRELATED PROCEEDINGS \nEx parte Rivers, WR-84,550-01 & 84,550-02 (Tex. \nCt.

Nine cir-\ncuits have split four ways over that question, and on-\nly this Court can resolve the conflict. \n1. This case is about the hurdles that a prisoner \nmust clear before a court will hear him out. Petitioner \nDanny Rivers sought habeas relief, arguing that his \ncounsel had failed to investigate his case and had \nshown up to trial drunk. The district court denied the \npetition, finding that Rivers couldn\u2019t explain what his \nlawyer should have done differently or why that \nwould have changed things. But the answer soon \nemerged. After fighting for years to obtain his coun-\nsel\u2019s records, Rivers finally received them while his \ninitial petition was up on appeal. Among the files, \nRivers found an exculpatory report suggesting that \nhe was wrongly convicted\u2014evidence that his lawyers \nnever once mentioned at trial.  \nNew evidence in hand, Rivers raced to court\u2014only \nto find the doors barred. Applying \u00a7 2244(b)(2), the \ndistrict court reasoned that it was \u201cwithout jurisdic-\ntion to entertain\u201d the new evidence because Rivers\u2019s \nfiling counted as a \u201csecond or successive\u201d petition. \nPet. App. 19a. (Never mind that his first petition was \nstill pending on appeal and would be for nearly a \nyear.) The Fifth Circuit affirmed, explaining that \u201cfil-\nings introduced after a final judgment that raise ha-\nbeas claims\u201d are \u201cdeemed successive.\u201d Pet. App. 10a. \n\n2 \n \n \n2. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision deepens a circuit con-\nflict over when \u00a7 2244(b)(2) kicks in. In the Second \nCircuit, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) doesn\u2019t apply until a prisoner \nhas exhausted appellate review of his initial habeas \npetition\u2014leaving district courts free to consider a fil-\ning like Rivers\u2019s. As then-Judge Sotomayor put it, \nthat approach guarantees \u201cone full opportunity to \nseek collateral review.\u201d Ching v. United States, 298 \nF.3d 174, 177 (2d Cir. 2002). But the Fifth Circuit ex-\npressly \u201cdecline[d] \u2026 to embrace\u201d that rule. Pet. App. \n10a. Instead, it joined the Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, \nNinth, and Eleventh Circuits in applying \u00a7 2244(b)(2) \nafter the district court enters final judgment. That \napproach effectively grants \u201cone full opportunity to \nseek collateral review in the district court.\u201d United \nStates v. Santarelli, 929 F.3d 95, 104 (3d Cir. 2019) \n(cleaned up). Meanwhile, the Third and Tenth Cir-\ncuits follow their own unique approaches, holding \nthat \u00a7 2244(b)(2) sometimes applies between final \njudgment and exhaustion and sometimes doesn\u2019t. \nThree circuits have already denied rehearing en banc, \nand the rest show no sign of rethinking their views. \nIn short: the circuits are intractably split, the con-\nflict won\u2019t disappear on its own, and this Court\u2019s \nguidance is badly needed. See Balbuena v. Sullivan, \n970 F.3d 1176, 1197, 1200 (9th Cir. 2020) (Fletcher, \nJ., concurring in the result) (\u201curg[ing] the Supreme \nCourt to recognize\u201d and \u201cresolve the conflict\u201d).  \n3. The decision below is also wrong. In Banister v. \nDavis, 590 U.S. 504 (2020), this Court explained that \nthe phrase \u201csecond or successive\u201d is a term of art that \ndoesn\u2019t simply refer to every second-in-time habeas \nfiling. Instead, the Court has looked to historical \npractice and statutory aims when determining \nwhether \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies. But the Fifth Circuit \n\n3 \n \n \ndidn\u2019t even cite Banister, let alone follow its guidance. \nHad it done so, the court would have realized that its \nrule doesn\u2019t square with history. Early courts analyz-\ning abuses of the writ treated appellate review\u2014not \nfinal judgment\u2014as the relevant inflection point. \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s approach will also frustrate \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2)\u2019s aims. At bottom, the question is not \nwhether prisoners like Rivers will try to bring new \nevidence to the courts\u2019 attention. (They will\u2014no mat-\nter what rule this Court adopts.) The question in-\nstead is which court will consider that evidence first. \nUnder the Second Circuit\u2019s approach, a filing like \nRivers\u2019s would have gone to the district court that \njust denied the initial petition: the single member of \nArticle III most familiar with the case. That judge \ncould then have weighed the new evidence and decid-\ned whether to issue an indicative ruling under Feder-\nal Rule of Civil Procedure 62.1. By contrast, the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s rule requires Rivers to ask a brand-new \nthree-judge panel for permission to ask the district \ncourt to consider whether or not to reach the merits. \nIt\u2019s hard to squeeze that rule from the statutory \ntext\u2014and harder still to attribute it to a Congress fo-\ncused on judicial economy, efficiency, and finality. \n4. The question presented is important, and this \ncase is an ideal vehicle. Until this Court weighs in, at \nleast some states and prisoners will be living under \nthe wrong rule, and those in the outstanding circuits \nwill have to guess which rule applies. The interests \non both sides are too critical to leave up to geograph-\nical chance. The split is also outcome-determinative \nhere: if Rivers were incarcerated in New York instead \nof Texas, courts would have considered the new evi-\ndence, giving him a meaningful path to relief. \nThe Court should grant review. \n\n4 \n \n \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe court of appeals\u2019 opinion is reported at 99 F.4th \n216 and is reproduced in the appendix to this petition \nat Pet. App. 1a\u201311a. The district court\u2019s opinion is \nunpublished but is available at 2021 WL 4319670 and \nis reproduced at Pet. App. 12a\u201317a. \nJURISDICTION \nThe Fifth Circuit issued its judgment on April 15, \n2024. Pet. App. 1a. This Court has jurisdiction under \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISION INVOLVED \nSection 2244(b)(2) of Title 28, U.S. Code, provides: \nA claim presented in a second or successive ha-\nbeas corpus application under section 2254 that \nwas not presented in a prior application shall be \ndismissed unless\u2014 \n(A) the applicant shows that the claim relies on \na new rule of constitutional law, made retroac-\ntive to cases on collateral review by the Su-\npreme Court, that was previously unavailable; \nor \n(B)(i) the factual predicate for the claim could \nnot have been discovered previously through \nthe exercise of due diligence; and \n(ii) the facts underlying the claim, if proven \nand viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, \nwould be sufficient to establish by clear and \nconvincing evidence that, but for constitutional \nerror, no reasonable factfinder would have \nfound the applicant guilty of the underlying of-\nfense. \n\n5 \n \n \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal background \n1. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty \nAct of 1996 creates a dual-track system for federal \nhabeas relief. One path is for first-time petitioners. \n\u201cUnder AEDPA, a state prisoner always gets one \nchance to bring a federal habeas challenge to his con-\nviction.\u201d Banister v. Davis, 590 U.S. 504, 509 (2020). \nThis path begins in the district court. If that court \ndenies relief, the prisoner may request a \u201ccertificate \nof appealability\u201d\u2014initially from the district court, \nand then from the court of appeals. See Gonzalez v. \nThaler, 565 U.S. 134, 140 & n.5 (2012). The path ends \nonly when the prisoner has exhausted the chance to \nappeal and seek certiorari. \nThe second path is \u201crockier.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at \n509. A prisoner who wants to file a \u201csecond or succes-\nsive \nhabeas \ncorpus \napplication,\u201d \n28 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2), must first ask the court of appeals for \n\u201can order authorizing the district court to consider \nthe application,\u201d id. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). The appellate \ncourt may oblige only if the prisoner makes a \u201cprima \nfacie showing,\u201d id. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(C), that the petition \n\u201crelies on a new and retroactive rule of constitutional \nlaw\u201d or \u201calleges previously undiscoverable facts that \nwould establish \u2026 innocence,\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at \n509 (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2)). If so, the petition \ngoes to the district court, which must decide for itself \nwhether the petition \u201csatisfies the requirements\u201d of \n\u00a7 2244. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(4). At the same time, be-\ncause any claim \u201cpresented in a prior application\u201d \nmust be dismissed, \u00a7 2244(b)(1), both courts must \ncarefully compare the new petition to all prior peti-\ntions to determine precisely what \u201cclaims\u201d the prison-\n\n6 \n \n \ner has brought. Only then\u2014after all that is done\u2014\nmay the district court reach the merits. \nThe upshot is that much rides on whether \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies\u2014that is: on whether a filing is \ndeemed \u201cpart and parcel of the first habeas proceed-\ning,\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 507, or instead a \u201csecond \nor successive habeas corpus application,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2).  \n2. The phrase \u201csecond or successive\u201d is a \u201cterm of \nart\u201d that does not refer simply to \u201call habeas filings \u2026 \nfollowing an initial application.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at \n511 (first quoting Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, \n486 (2000), then quoting Magwood, 561 U.S. at 332 \n(2010)). To determine when \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies, \u201cthis \nCourt has looked for guidance in two main places.\u201d \nId. at 512. First, the Court has considered history: \n\u201cwhether a type of later-in-time filing would have \nconstituted an abuse of the writ\u201d under the Court\u2019s  \n\u201cpre-AEDPA cases.\u201d Id. (cleaned up) (quoting Panetti \nv. Quarterman, 551 U.S. 930, 947 (2007)). Second, the \nCourt has looked to \u201cAEDPA\u2019s own purposes\u201d: con-\nserving judicial resources, reducing piecemeal litiga-\ntion, and achieving finality \u201cwithin a reasonable \ntime.\u201d Id. (citing Panetti, 551 U.S. at 945\u201346). \nB. Factual and procedural background \nDanny Rivers has spent the last twelve years \nfighting to prove his innocence. Along the way, he \ndiscovered that exculpatory evidence had been sitting \nin his trial counsel\u2019s files all the while\u2014evidence that \nhis lawyers could have used to clear his name. If Riv-\ners is right, then he not only received ineffective as-\nsistance but was also wrongly convicted. This case is \nabout the procedural hurdles that Rivers must clear \nbefore a court will hear him out. \n\n7 \n \n \n1. Rivers is tried and convicted \nIn 2012, a Texas jury convicted Rivers of sexually \nabusing his children and possessing child pornogra-\nphy. He is currently serving a 38-year sentence. \na. This case began amidst a bitter divorce. In 2008, \na Texas judge awarded Rivers temporary custody of \nhis 9-year-old daughter. Rivers v. Lumpkin, No. 7:21-\ncv-00012 (N.D. Tex.), Dkt. 11-14 (\u201cR-1\u201d), at 156, 164. \nThe court also granted Rivers sole use of the family \nhome, ordered his ex-wife to pay child support, and \ndenied her request for alimony. Id. Dkt. 11-15 (\u201cR-2\u201d), \nat 15. In response, Rivers\u2019s ex-wife \u201cpunish[ed]\u201d him \nby \u201cnot letting him see\u201d his 12-year-old stepdaughter, \nwhom he had raised as his own. R-2, at 16. \nThe following year, with custody arrangements un-\nchanged, Rivers\u2019s ex-wife drove the children to the \npolice station while Rivers was away for work. Both \ngirls met with officers and accused Rivers of sexually \nabusing them. R-2, at 18, 129. Police then searched \nRivers\u2019s home, seized the family laptop, and launched \na monthslong forensic examination, eventually identi-\nfying \u201ctwo files of interest\u201d that \u201cappeared to be child \npornography.\u201d Id. at 26, 28; id. Dkt. 11-10 (\u201cR-3\u201d), at \n13, 31, 73; id. Dkt. 11-16, at 15, 66\u201367. \nb. A Wichita County, Texas grand jury indicted \nRivers for continuous sexual abuse, indecency with a \nchild, and two counts of possessing child pornogra-\nphy. R-3, at 8\u201315. Rivers, who had no prior criminal \nhistory, R-2, at 161, pleaded not guilty. \nWith his trial looming, Rivers moved to sever the \nchild-pornography counts, arguing that they might \ncolor the jury\u2019s views on the other charges. R-1, at 15. \nThe state opposed severance. Because its case had \n\u201cno DNA or physical evidence,\u201d Texas argued that the \n\n8 \n \n \nalleged child pornography was \u201cnecessary\u201d to estab-\nlish Rivers\u2019s \u201cmotive\u201d and \u201cattraction to young girls.\u201d \nId. at 14\u201315. The court refused to sever. Id. at 23. \nc. At trial, Rivers\u2019s daughter and stepdaughter al-\nleged a staggering pattern of sexual abuse. R-1, at \n142, 145\u2013146, 167\u2013168. They further claimed that \nRivers had shown them child pornography at least \nseventy times, testifying that he had \u201cdownloaded \nmultiple videos\u201d and played different films on differ-\nent occasions. Id. at 153, 172. Rivers\u2019s daughter also \naccused her father of secretly recording images in the \nshower. R-1, at 170. (No hidden cameras were ever \nfound.) All told, the girls alleged over 200 instances of \nshocking abuse, many of which reportedly took place \nin common areas of the home while their mother, un-\ncle, or cousin were also present in the house. R-1, at \n139, 147, 152\u201353, 156, 158, 166; R-2, at 12, 90. No \nother witnesses saw the alleged abuse, and no physi-\ncal evidence corroborated the story. R-2, at 34, 64. \nGiven the lack of supporting evidence, the alleged \nchild pornography was a key issue at trial. The prose-\ncution called multiple witnesses to testify about the \ntwo files\u2014a single image and a single video\u2014that \nRivers was charged with possessing. R-2, at 19, 28, \n44, 74, 84, 100. While the trial judge had granted a \ncontinuance so the defense could obtain its own fo-\nrensic experts, R-3, at 31, 40, counsel did not do so. \nR-2, at 112. Instead, the defense called only a single \nwitness, who testified that Rivers was out of town \nwhen the files were allegedly downloaded. R-2, at \n113\u2013114, 131. \nd. The jury convicted Rivers on all charges, Pet. \nApp. 2a. It rejected the prosecution\u2019s call for a 169-\nyear sentence, however, and recommended that the \ncourt sentence Rivers to 42 years instead. R-3, at \n\n9 \n \n \n213\u201314, 221\u201329. The court went lower still: 38 years \nbehind bars, all counts considered\u2014just three years \nabove the minimum. Pet. App. 13a. The Texas Court \nof Appeals affirmed. \n2. Rivers seeks postconviction relief \na. In 2013, Rivers began asking his lawyers to send \nhim his client file. He explained: \u201cI don\u2019t know what \nall it contains, but it looks like I\u2019m going to have to do \nthis thing pro se, so I need everything I can get.\u201d \nNo. 7:21-cv-00012 (N.D. Tex.) Dkt. 15-11, at 67. \nCounsel \u201cnever responded to [his] request,\u201d and two \nyears later, Rivers was still trying. Id. at 68\u201369. He \neventually resorted to filing a formal grievance with \nthe Texas state bar. \nMeanwhile, Rivers pressed forward with what rec-\nords he had. In 2016, he sought state postconviction \nrelief based on ineffective assistance, among other \ngrounds. Relevant here, he argued that his trial \ncounsel had failed to \u201cperform an objectively reasona-\nble investigation\u201d or \u201cverify the ages of the persons\u201d \nin the alleged child pornography. No. 7:21-cv-00012 \n(N.D. Tex.), Dkt. 12-21, at 9. He added that his lead \ncounsel was \u201cinebriated\u201d at the trial. Id. at 11. \nThe Texas Court of Criminal Appeals found that \nRivers had \u201calleged facts that, if true, might entitle \nhim to relief.\u201d Ex parte Rivers, 2016 WL 5800277, at \n*1 (Tex. Crim. App. Oct. 5, 2016). It remanded for \nfurther factfinding, ordering the court to appoint \ncounsel if it \u201celect[ed] to hold a hearing.\u201d Id. Judge \nAlcala wrote separately to urge the appointment of \ncounsel \u201cregardless of whether the trial court holds a \nhearing.\u201d Id. (Alcala, J., concurring). \nOn remand, the trial court neither held a hearing \nnor appointed counsel. Instead, it chiefly relied on af-\n\n10 \n \n \nfidavits in which trial counsel defended their perfor-\nmance, denied any drunkenness, and claimed that \nRivers had \u201cadmitted to [them] that he engaged in \nsexual acts with the victims.\u201d Rivers v. Davis, 2018 \nWL 4443153, at *3 (N.D. Tex. July 27, 2018); see also \nNo. 7:17-cv-00124 (N.D. Tex.), Dkt. 24-1, at 24. Rivers \nresponded with his own affidavit, categorically \u201cde-\nny[ing] making such admissions.\u201d Id. at 2. He also \nsubmitted a text message from one of the lawyers\u2019 \nspouses, confirming that counsel \u201cshowed up intoxi-\ncated for court,\u201d id. at 25, and a news report showing \nthat his lead counsel was arrested six months before \nthe trial \u201cafter showing up at a woman[\u2019]s house na-\nked and drunk,\u201d id. at 33 (cleaned up) (quoting Tex-\noma, Local Attorney Sentenced to Two Years Proba-\ntion (Mar. 18, 2015), bit.ly/Barber-Arrest). The trial \ncourt nonetheless \u201cconcluded that counsel were not \nineffective,\u201d and the Court of Criminal Appeals af-\nfirmed. Ex parte Rivers, 2017 WL 3380491, at *1 \n(Tex. Crim. App. June 7, 2017). \nb. Rivers sought federal habeas relief in August \n2017, raising the same ineffective-assistance claims, \namong other grounds. No. 7:17-cv-00124 (N.D. Tex.), \nDkt. 1, at 6. The district court denied Rivers\u2019s habeas \npetition and declined to grant a certificate of appeal-\nability. Pet. App. 2a. Rivers then sought a certificate \nof appealability from the Fifth Circuit. \n3. While his habeas appeal is pending, \nRivers obtains exculpatory evidence \na. While his case was pending on appeal, Rivers fi-\nnally received the client file that he first requested in \n2013. Pet. App. 2a. In it, he found a state investiga-\ntor\u2019s report analyzing the two files underlying his \nchild-pornography conviction. The report called the \nvideo merely \u201cof interest,\u201d without further comment. \n\n11 \n \n \nMeanwhile, the image was labeled \u201cNOT CHILD \nPORN.\u201d No. 7:21-cv-00012 (N.D. Tex.), Dkt. 15-11, at \n75\u201377. The report also listed a number of other files \nfound on the family laptop. Next to one\u2014entitled  \n\u201creallyunderagekiddieporn\u201d\u2014the state investigator \nhad written: \u201calthough the title indicated it to be \nchild porn,\u201d it \u201cis not.\u201d Id. at 75. Another, whose title \nincluded phrases like \u201cpre-teen tiny children\u201d and \n\u201cincest sex porn underage,\u201d was also marked \u201cNOT \nCHILD PORN.\u201d Id. Most telling of all, these files \nand the video \u201cof interest\u201d were not saved under Riv-\ners\u2019s name; they were instead recovered from a down-\nload folder bearing the name of Rivers\u2019s ex-wife. \nAfter discovering the investigator\u2019s report, Rivers \nmoved to supplement the appellate record. See \nNo. 18-11490 (5th Cir.), Dkt. 27. He also filed an affi-\ndavit stating that he had never seen the report and \nnoting that his lawyers had \u201cfailed to raise this ex-\nculpatory evidence\u201d that had been \u201cin [their] posses-\nsion\u201d all along. Id. at 5, 10\u201311. The affidavit added \nthat Rivers\u2019s \u201cestranged wife had access to the house \nand did in fact enter the house, against court orders, \nwhile [Rivers] was out of town during the time frame \nthe alleged child porn was downloaded,\u201d id. at 7\u2014one \nexplanation for why the \u201cchild pornography\u201d ap-\npeared under her username, not his. \nThe Fifth Circuit denied Rivers\u2019s motion to supple-\nment the record but granted a certificate of appeala-\nbility for the ineffective-assistance claim. Id. Dkt. 34, \nat 2. Rivers later asked the court either to stay his \nappeal or to remand so he could seek relief in the dis-\ntrict court without creating \u201cpiecemeal litigation.\u201d Id. \nDkt. 61, at 5\u20136. The Fifth Circuit refused, id. Dkt. 78, \nand ultimately affirmed, see Rivers v. Lumpkin, 2022 \n\n12 \n \n \nWL 1517027 (5th Cir. May 13, 2022), cert. denied, 143 \nS. Ct. 1090 (2023). \nb. In February 2021, while his appeal was still \npending, Rivers used the standard \u00a7 2254 petition \ntemplate provided to pro se litigants to bring the new \nevidence to the district court\u2019s attention. No. 7:21-cv-\n00012 (N.D. Tex.), Dkt. 2, at 7. While the filing also \nraised several new claims, Rivers chiefly argued that \ntrial counsel\u2019s \u201cfail[ure] to present exculpatory evi-\ndence\u201d violated his right to effective assistance. Id. \nDkt. 10, at 24. \nThe same magistrate judge who reviewed Rivers\u2019s \ninitial habeas petition recommended that the new fil-\ning be deemed a \u201csecond or successive\u201d petition and \ntransferred to the Fifth Circuit for lack of jurisdic-\ntion. See Pet. App. 3a\u20134a. Rivers objected to the rec-\nommendation, No. 7:21-cv-00012 (N.D. Tex.), Dkt. 27, \nand \u201cmove[d] the court to consider an interlocutory \nreview,\u201d id. Dkt. 26, at 5. The district court adopted \nthe recommendation and denied Rivers\u2019s motion as \nmoot. See Pet. App. 18a\u201319a \nRivers appealed the transfer order, urging the court \nto construe the February 2021 filing as an amend-\nment to his initial petition, instead of a second or suc-\ncessive petition. Pet. App. 3a\u20134a. The Fifth Circuit \naffirmed. Id. at 1a\u20132a. It reasoned that \u00a7 2244(b)(2) \napplies to \u201cfilings introduced after a final judgment \nthat raise habeas claims, no matter how titled.\u201d Id. at \n10a. Here, the February 2021 filing was \u201csecond-in-\ntime\u201d and \u201cattack[ed] the same conviction that [Riv-\ners had] challenged\u201d in his initial habeas proceeding, \nso it counted as \u201csecond or successive.\u201d Id. at 6a. The \ncourt\u2019s opinion acknowledged that eight other circuits \nhad splintered on the question. Id. at 8a. \n\n13 \n \n \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \nThe courts of appeals are intractably split over \nwhether \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies to a habeas filing made \nafter the district court has denied an initial petition \nbut before an appellate court has weighed in. That \nquestion is critically important to states and prison-\ners alike, and it arises too often to leave up to geo-\ngraphical happenstance. The decision below is also \nwrong. It ignores this Court\u2019s guidance in Banister, \nflies in the face of historical practice, and frustrates\u2014\nrather than furthers\u2014AEDPA\u2019s aims. Finally, this \ncase is an ideal vehicle for the Court to offer much-\nneeded guidance. The issue is cleanly presented and \noutcome-determinative: only the Fifth Circuit\u2019s mis-\ntaken reading of \u00a7 2244(b)(2) stands between Rivers \nand a meaningful path to relief. The Court should \ngrant the petition. \nI. The courts of appeals are split four ways \nover what triggers \u00a7 2244(b)(2), and only \nthis Court can resolve the conflict. \nNine circuits have split four ways over the question \npresented. In the Second Circuit, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) does \nnot apply until the petitioner exhausts appellate re-\nview of his first habeas petition. The Fifth, Sixth, \nSeventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits disa-\ngree, holding that \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies as soon as, or \nshortly after, the district court enters final judgment. \n(Even they can\u2019t agree on the precise trigger.) Mean-\nwhile, the Tenth Circuit applies \u00a7 2244(b)(2) even \nearlier\u2014except when the petitioner satisfies a seven-\nfactor test. And in the Third Circuit, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) tog-\ngles on and off depending on whether the petitioner \nwins or loses on appeal. Respondent acknowledged \nthe split below, see No. 21-11031 (5th Cir.), Dkt. 52, \nat 15\u201324, and only this Court can resolve it.  \n\n14 \n \n \nA. In the Second Circuit, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) does \nnot apply until appellate review of the \nfirst habeas petition is exhausted.  \nIn Whab v. United States, the Second Circuit held \nthat \u00a7 2244(b)(2) does not apply while \u201cappellate pro-\nceedings following the district court\u2019s dismissal of the \ninitial petition remain pending.\u201d 408 F.3d 116, 118 \n(2d Cir. 2005).  \nUsama Whab filed a pro se habeas petition. Id. at \n117. The district court denied the petition and de-\nclined to issue a certificate of appealability. Id. at \n118. Whab then sought a certificate of appealability \nfrom the Second Circuit, which the court ultimately \ndenied. Id. While that motion was still pending, how-\never, Whab asked the Second Circuit for permission \nto file a \u201csecond or successive\u201d petition. Id. at 119. \nThe court held that Whab\u2019s \u201csubsequent petition \nwas not \u2018second or successive\u2019 within the meaning of\u201d \nAEDPA. Id. at 118. Citing then-Judge Sotomayor\u2019s \nrationale in Ching v. United States, it explained that \na petition can\u2019t be \u201csecond or successive\u201d unless it is \nfiled after \u201cthe conclusion of a proceeding that counts \nas the first.\u201d 298 F.3d at 177. And the first proceeding \nisn\u2019t over until the \u201copportunity to seek review in the \nSupreme Court has expired.\u201d Whab, 408 F.3d at 120. \nBecause Whab\u2019s first proceeding was still pending \nwhen he filed his subsequent petition, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) \ndid not apply. Id. at 119.  \nOf course, that doesn\u2019t mean that anything goes. \n\u201cTraditional doctrines, such as abuse of the writ, con-\ntinue to apply.\u201d Id. at 119 n.2. So even if a filing is \nnot \u201csecond or successive\u201d under \u00a7 2244(b)(2), prison-\ners do not get a \u201cfree pass\u201d to \u201cfile numerous petitions \nbefore an initially filed petition is finally adjudicated \n\n15 \n \n \non the merits.\u201d Id.; see also Ching, 298 F.3d at 179\u2013\n80 (\u201cCourts are not obliged to entertain needless or \npiecemeal litigation; nor should they adjudicate a mo-\ntion or petition whose purpose is to vex, harass, or \ndelay.\u201d) Neither can prisoners \u201cprevent the adjudica-\ntion of an initial habeas petition from ever becoming \nfinal by extending the first habeas proceedings \nthrough an infinite number of new petitions.\u201d Fuller \nv. United States, 815 F.3d 112, 113 (2d Cir. 2016). \nSection 2244(b)(2) kicks in \u201cwhen the time to file a \npetition for certiorari \u2026 expire[s]\u201d\u2014whether or not a \nfollow-up petition is still pending. Id. \nSince Whab, the Second Circuit has repeatedly re-\naffirmed this workable approach. E.g., Garcia v. Su-\nperintendent of Great Meadow Corr. Facility, 841 \nF.3d 581, 582 (2d Cir. 2016); Fuller, 815 F.3d at 113.  \nB. In the Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, \nNinth, and Eleventh Circuits, \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies when the district \ncourt enters final judgment or  \nshortly after. \nSix circuits have expressly rejected the Second Cir-\ncuit\u2019s approach, holding that \u00a7 2244(b)(2) is triggered \nat (or around) the time that the district court enters \nfinal judgment. Yet even these courts can\u2019t agree on \nexactly what triggers the statute. \n1. In the Fifth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Elev-\nenth Circuits, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies as soon as the dis-\ntrict court enters final judgment. \na. The Fifth Circuit below recognized the split and \n\u201cdecline[d] \u2026 to embrace\u201d the Second Circuit\u2019s rule, \nholding instead that \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies after the en-\ntry of final judgment. Pet. App. 10a\u201312a. \n\n16 \n \n \nThe district court denied Danny Rivers\u2019s pro se ha-\nbeas petition and entered final judgment. Pet. \nApp. 2a. The Fifth Circuit then granted a certificate \nof appealability as to Rivers\u2019s ineffective-assistance \nclaim. Id. While that appeal was pending, Rivers \nsought further relief in the district court. Applying \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2), the district court deemed Rivers\u2019s filing \na \u201csecond or successive\u201d petition, and the Fifth Cir-\ncuit affirmed. \nAccording to the Fifth Circuit, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) covers \n\u201cfilings introduced after a final judgment that raise \nhabeas claims.\u201d Pet. App. 10a. The court derived that \nrule from this Court\u2019s decision in Gonzalez v. Crosby, \n545 U.S. 524 (2005). The prisoner in Gonzalez \u201cdid \nnot file for rehearing or review\u201d in his first habeas \nproceeding and then sought Rule 60(b) relief a year \nlater. Id. at 527. This Court held that \u00a7 2244(b)(2) did \nnot apply because the prisoner\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion \ndid not raise habeas claims. The Fifth Circuit read \nGonzalez to stand for the \u201cunderlying principle\u201d that \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies after final judgment, lest prison-\ners use \u201cpost-judgment motions\u201d to evade AEDPA. \nBut see Balbuena, 970 F.3d at 1200 (Fletcher, J., con-\ncurring in the result) (\u201cGonzalez does not answer the \nquestion whether [a petition] is a \u2018second or succes-\nsive\u2019 habeas application under \u00a7 2244(b).\u201d). \nb. The Ninth Circuit also applies \u00a7 2244(b)(2) as \nsoon as the district court has \u201cadjudicated [a] habeas \npetition on the merits.\u201d Balbuena v. Sullivan, 980 \nF.3d 619, 642 (9th Cir. 2020).  \nWhile the denial of Alexander Balbuena\u2019s habeas \npetition was still pending on appeal, Balbuena sought \nadditional relief in the district court. Id. at 628, 639. \nThe district court deemed Balbuena\u2019s subsequent fil-\ning \u201can unauthorized second or successive petition,\u201d \n\n17 \n \n \nand the Ninth Circuit affirmed. Id. at 628. Citing cir-\ncuit precedent, it held that \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applied be-\ncause Balbuena \u201csought to add a new claim after the \ndistrict court denied his petition.\u201d Id. at 636\u201337. \nAlong the way, the Ninth Circuit expressly acknowl-\nedged\u2014and \u201cdecline[d] to follow\u201d\u2014the Second Cir-\ncuit\u2019s contrary approach. Id. at 637. \nJudge Fletcher wrote separately to \u201curge the Su-\npreme Court to recognize the circuit split and adopt\u201d \nthe Second Circuit\u2019s rule. Id. at 642 (Fletcher, J., con-\ncurring in the result). In his view, the Ninth Circuit \n\u201cmade a mistake\u201d both \u201cas a matter of ordinary lan-\nguage\u201d and \u201cas a practical matter.\u201d Id. at 644. As to \ntext, he reasoned that \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies \u201conly once \nan appeal has been finally adjudicated.\u201d Id. And as to \nconsequences, he explained that the Second Circuit\u2019s \nrule \u201cwill not result in a flood of late and procedurally \nabusive claims.\u201d Id. He closed by \u201cencourag[ing]\u201d this \nCourt to \u201cresolve the conflict in the circuits\u201d and ex-\npressing \u201coptimis[m]\u201d that it would \u201cagree with\u201d the \nSecond Circuit \u201crather than\u201d the Ninth. Id. at 645. \nc. The Seventh Circuit also holds that final judg-\nment triggers \u00a7 2244(b)(2). See Phillips v. United \nStates, 668 F.3d 433, 435\u201336 (7th Cir. 2012). While \nthe Seventh Circuit was reviewing his habeas denial, \nDavid Phillips asked the district court to consider \nnewly discovered evidence. Id. at 434. The district \ncourt denied that motion on the merits, but the Sev-\nenth Circuit approached things differently. It held \nthat the new filing was not \u201cproperly before the dis-\ntrict court\u201d in the first place because it was a second-\nor-successive petition. Id. That was so (reasoned the \ncourt) because \u201c[f]inal judgment marks a terminal \npoint,\u201d and \u201c[t]reating motions filed during appeal as \n\n18 \n \n \npart of the original application\u201d would undermine \nAEDPA\u2019s \u201ctime-and-number limits.\u201d Id. at 435. \nd. The Eighth Circuit follows a similar approach. \nSee Williams v. Norris, 461 F.3d 999 (8th Cir. 2006). \nAfter the district court denied Frank Williams\u2019s ha-\nbeas petition, it failed to enter a separate final judg-\nment. Id. at 1000\u201301. In the brief period before the \norder became final, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 58, Williams \nmoved to amend the judgment and sought relief from \nit. 461 F.3d at 1000\u201301. The district court denied \nboth motions as second-or-successive habeas peti-\ntions. Id. The Eighth Circuit affirmed, reasoning that \nthe district court had intended to \u201cdispose of Wil-\nliams\u2019s petition on the merits,\u201d so his later filings \nwere \n\u201cpostjudgment\u201d\u2014and \nthus \nsubject \nto \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2). Id. at 1002. \ne. The Eleventh Circuit also applies \u00a7 2244(b)(2) af-\nter final judgment. See United States v. Terrell, 141 \nF. App\u2019x 849, 851\u201352 (11th Cir. 2005). Shortly after \nGeorge Terrell asked the Eleventh Circuit to review \nthe denial of his initial habeas petition, he sought ad-\nditional habeas relief in the district court. Id. at 850\u2013\n51. The district court applied \u00a7 2244(b)(2), deeming \nhis motion an unauthorized second-or-successive ap-\nplication. Id. at 851. The Eleventh Circuit agreed, \nemphasizing that \u201cthe district court had already de-\nnied\u201d Terrell\u2019s initial habeas petition. Id. at 852.  \n2. The Sixth Circuit follows a slightly different rule, \ntying \u00a7 2244(b)(2) to the opportunity for appeal\u2014not \nthe entry of final judgment. \nSamuel Moreland\u2019s initial habeas petition was still \npending on appeal when Moreland sought further \nhabeas relief in the district court. Moreland v. Robin-\nson, 813 F.3d 315, 322 (6th Cir. 2016). The Sixth Cir-\n\n19 \n \n \ncuit deemed Moreland\u2019s filings \u201csecond or successive \nhabeas petitions.\u201d Id. at 319. But instead of pegging \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2) to the entry of final judgment, like the \nFifth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits, \nthe Sixth Circuit focused on the window for appeal. \nIn its view, a motion that \u201cseeks to raise habeas \nclaims\u201d is a \u201csecond or successive habeas petition\u201d \nwhen filed \u201cafter the petitioner has appealed the dis-\ntrict court\u2019s denial of his original habeas petition or \nafter the time for the petitioner to do so has expired.\u201d \nId. at 325. In other words, courts in the Sixth Circuit \nask whether \u201cthe district court has \u2026 lost jurisdiction \nof the original habeas petition.\u201d Jones v. Bradshaw, \n46 F.4th 459, 479\u201381 (6th Cir. 2022). This means that \na petitioner who would be out of luck in the other cir-\ncuits could get relief in the Sixth Circuit while the \nwindow to appeal is still open. \nC. In the Tenth Circuit, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies \nafter a first-in-time petition is filed, un-\nless the petitioner satisfies a seven-\nfactor test.  \nThe Tenth Circuit applies \u00a7 2244(b)(2) whenever a \nsecond-in-time petition raises \u201cseparate and distinct\u201d \nclaims\u2014even if the first-in-time petition is still pend-\ning before the district court. United States v. Espino-\nza-Saenz, 235 F.3d 501, 503, 505 (10th Cir. 2000). \nThat rule puts the Tenth Circuit at odds with not on-\nly the Second Circuit, see Ochoa v. Sirmons, 485 F.3d \n538, 540\u201341 (10th Cir. 2007) (\u201cdeclin[ing]\u201d to follow \nthe Second Circuit\u2019s rule), but also with other circuits \nthat allow amendments before final judgment, e.g., \nPhillips, 668 F.3d at 435.  \nBut petitioners in the Tenth Circuit can avoid this \notherwise strict rule when \u201cjustice\u201d demands. Doug-\nlas v. Workman, 560 F.3d 1156, 1190 (10th Cir. 2009). \n\n20 \n \n \nWhile the denial of his first habeas petition was \npending on appeal, Yancy Douglas asked the Tenth \nCircuit for permission to file a second application as-\nserting that prosecutors had concealed information \nabout a key witness. Id. at 1160, 1167\u201368. The Tenth \nCircuit acknowledged that, under Ochoa, it \u201cwould \nnot ordinarily permit a habeas petitioner to supple-\nment his habeas petition in this way.\u201d Id. at 1189. \nBut this was no ordinary case. Rather, based on \u201csev-\nen factors\u201d\u2014including that Douglas\u2019s initial habeas \npetition remained pending, that the new claim relat-\ned closely to his pending claims, the prosecutor\u2019s con-\nduct, that Douglas faced the death penalty, and dis-\nparity between Douglas and his codefendant\u2014the \ncourt decided to \u201cdeem\u201d the later petition \u201ca supple-\nment to the previously asserted\u201d petition, rather than \na second-or-successive petition. Id. at 1189\u201396. The \nupshot is that courts in the Tenth Circuit don\u2019t apply \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2) under circumstances when courts in the \nFifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Eleventh \nCircuits would have to. See also United States v. \nPickard, 396 F. App\u2019x 568, 572 (10th Cir. 2010). \nD. In the Third Circuit, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) toggles \non and off depending on who wins the \ninitial appeal.  \nFinally, the Third Circuit follows its own unique \nrule. It agrees with the Second Circuit that \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2) does not automatically apply to a \u201csubse-\nquent habeas petition\u201d filed before \u201cexhaustion of ap-\npellate remedies with respect to the denial of [the] \ninitial habeas petition.\u201d Santarelli, 929 F.3d at 104\u2013\n05. But prisoners in Delaware, New Jersey, and \nPennsylvania face a twist that those in Connecticut, \nNew York, and Vermont don\u2019t. When a prisoner in \nthe Third Circuit seeks further habeas relief while \n\n21 \n \n \nhis initial petition is pending on appeal, the applica-\nbility of \u00a7 2244(b)(2) depends on the outcome of that \nappeal. See id. at 104 n.5 (Even if a \u201csubsequent ha-\nbeas petition\u201d is \u201cnot \u2018second or successive\u2019 at the time \nof filing,\u201d it \u201ccould later be construed as a \u2018second or \nsuccessive\u2019 habeas petition.\u201d). \nHere\u2019s the Third Circuit\u2019s logic. While the first peti-\ntion is up on appeal, the petitioner has not had \u201cone \nfull opportunity to seek collateral review.\u201d Id. at 105 \n(citation omitted). So a subsequent petition filed dur-\ning that period should be \u201cconstrued as a motion to \namend\u201d the first petition. Id. at 105\u201306. That motion \nbelongs \u201cin the district court in the first instance.\u201d Id. \nat 106. Yet the district court lacks jurisdiction while \nthe appeal is pending, so the motion to amend must \nstay on ice. Id. Now for the twist. If the Third Circuit \n\u201cvacates or reverses \u2026 and remands the matter,\u201d the \ndistrict court \u201cwould again be vested with jurisdiction \nto consider\u201d the motion. Id. When that happens, \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2) doesn\u2019t apply. On the other hand, if the \nprisoner \u201cexhausts her appellate remedies to no \navail,\u201d she has \u201cexpended the \u2018one full opportunity to \nseek collateral review\u2019 that AEDPA ensures.\u201d Id. (ci-\ntation omitted). In that case, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) does apply \nand\u2014presto!\u2014the \u201cmotion to amend\u201d becomes a \u201csec-\nond or successive\u201d habeas petition. Id. \n*     *     * \nOnly this Court can \u201cresolve the conflict in the cir-\ncuits,\u201d Balbuena, 980 F.3d at 642 (Fletcher, J., con-\ncurring in the result), and there is no reason to wait. \nThree circuits have already denied rehearing en \nbanc\u2014and one of them has done so twice. See Order, \nPhillips v. United States, Nos. 10-2154 & 11-1498 \n(7th Cir. Feb. 21, 2012); Order, Williams v. Norris, \nNo. 04-3485 (8th Cir. Jan. 11, 2007); Order, Balbuena \n\n22 \n \n \nv. Sullivan, Nos. 12-16414, 18-15432 (9th Cir. Nov. \n17, 2020); Order, Jacobs v. Thornell, No. 22-16822 \n(9th Cir. Apr. 9, 2024). The others show no sign of re-\nthinking their positions. Nor is there any need for \nmore percolation. The nine circuits that have already \nweighed in cover roughly 88% of all federal and state \nprisoners. See Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Statistics, \nbit.ly/Federal-Prisons; Prison Pol\u2019y Initiative, Appen-\ndix: State and Federal Prison Populations 2019-2023, \nbit.ly/State-Prisons. All positions are staked out, and \nthis Court now has the benefit of numerous opinions \non the issue. The Court should grant review. \nII. The question presented is critically im-\nportant and recurring. \nA. The question presented is too important to punt. \nSince 1996, AEDPA cases have become a fixture of \nthis Court\u2019s docket. In fact, the Court has repeatedly \ngranted cert to resolve conflicts over this very provi-\nsion. See, e.g., Banister, 590 U.S. at 511 (5-3 split); \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. 524 (2005); Slack v. McDaniel, \n529 U.S. 473 (2000) (3-4 split); Stewart v. Martinez-\nVillareal, 523 U.S. 637, 641 (1998) (1-1 split). That \nalone suggests certworthiness\u2014even apart from the \nfact that this split is deeper than those. \nThe issue is also critically important to parties on \nboth sides. Until this Court weighs in, at least some \nstates and prisoners will be living under the wrong \nrule, and those in the outstanding circuits will have \nto guess which rule applies. For states, that uncer-\ntainty turns AEDPA\u2019s promise of \u201cfinality\u201d on its \nhead. Banister, 590 U.S. at 512. But the stakes are \neven higher for prisoners. Cf. Boumediene v. Bush, \n553 U.S. 723, 739 (2008) (calling habeas \u201cone of the \nfew safeguards of liberty specified in a Constitution \nthat, at the outset, had no Bill of Rights\u201d). \u201cFederal \n\n23 \n \n \npostconviction law is complex, and few prisoners un-\nderstand it well.\u201d Curry v. United States, 507 F.3d \n603, 604 (7th Cir. 2007). So the last thing they need \nwhen seeking to navigate AEDPA\u2019s procedural thick-\net is uncertainty over which thicket they are in. \nB. The need for review is all the more pressing be-\ncause this issue arises so often. Two circuits have \nconfronted the question presented in the last four \nmonths. See Pet. App. 1a; Jacobs v. Thornell, 2024 \nWL 810443 (9th Cir. Feb. 27, 2024). But that\u2019s noth-\ning compared to the district courts. See, e.g., Daly v. \nOliver, 2024 WL 2092997, at *3 (E.D. Pa. May 9, \n2024), appeal docketed, No. 24-2070 (3d Cir. June 18, \n2024); Herrera v. United States, 2024 WL 218964, at \n*1 (N.D. Tex. Jan. 19, 2024); Hernandez v. Macomber, \n2023 WL 2992172, at *3 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 17, 2023); \nThomas v. Sec\u2019y, Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., 2023 WL \n2837521, at *9\u201311 (M.D. Fla. Apr. 7, 2023); Bollinger \nv. Gittere, 2023 WL 2242444, at *1\u20133 (D. Nev. Feb. \n24, 2023), appeal docketed, No. 23-99002 (9th Cir. \nMarch. 28, 2023); Perpall v. United States, 2023 WL \n2016836, at *1\u20132 (S.D. Fla. Feb. 15, 2023) (acknowl-\nedging the split); Atkins v. United States, 2023 WL \n1765536, at *3 (S.D. Fla. Feb. 3, 2023) (same).  \nAnd those are just (some of) the cases available on \nWestlaw. The federal courts received over 14,000 ha-\nbeas petitions last year. See U.S. Courts, Civil Statis-\ntical Tables For the Federal Judiciary (Dec. 31, 2023), \nbit.ly/2023-Statistics. Since one in ten habeas cases \ninvolves an amended petition, see N. King, et al., Fi-\nnal Technical Report: Habeas Litigation in U.S. Dis-\ntrict Courts 34 (2007), bit.ly/Habeas-Report, the real \nnumbers are likely far higher. Cf. Rachel Brown, et \nal., Is Unpublished Unequal? An Empirical Examina-\ntion of the 87% Nonpublication Rate in Federal Ap-\n\n24 \n \n \npeals, 107 Cornell L. Rev. 1, 62 (2021) (finding that \npro se, non-capital habeas cases are \u201cpublished at less \nthan one-third of the overall rate\u201d). \nIII. The decision below is wrong. \nThe Fifth Circuit thought that \u00a7 2244(b)(2) required \nthe district court to dismiss \u201cfor lack of jurisdiction\u201d \nbecause Rivers\u2019s 2021 filing was \u201cintroduced after a \nfinal judgment\u201d and \u201craise[d] habeas claims.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 10a\u201311a. That is wrong. Banister showed how \ncourts should determine \u201cwhat qualifies as second or \nsuccessive,\u201d 590 U.S. at 512, and its logic favors Riv-\ners here. But the Fifth Circuit didn\u2019t even cite Banis-\nter\u2014let alone engage in the proper analysis\u2014and its \nrule doesn\u2019t square with this Court\u2019s holdings either.    \nA. Section 2244(b)(2) does not apply until \nappellate review of the first habeas ap-\nplication is exhausted. \nThe phrase \u201csecond or successive application\u201d is a \n\u201cterm of art\u201d that is \u201cnot self-defining.\u201d Banister, 590 \nU.S. at 511 (quoting Slack, 529 U.S. at 486). To de-\ntermine when \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies, \u201cthis Court has \nlooked for guidance in two main places.\u201d Id. at 512. \nFirst, history: \u201cwhether a type of later-in-time filing \nwould have constituted an abuse of the writ, as that \nconcept is explained\u201d in this Court\u2019s \u201cpre-AEDPA cas-\nes.\u201d Id. (cleaned up) (quoting Panetti, 551 U.S. at \n947). Second, \u201cAEDPA\u2019s own purposes\u201d: conserving \njudicial resources, reducing piecemeal litigation, and \nachieving finality \u201cwithin a reasonable time.\u201d Id. (cit-\ning Panetti, 551 U.S. at 945\u201346). Here, both factors \nalign. Early courts applied abuse-of-the-writ rules in \nlight of appellate review, not final judgment, and ap-\nplying \u00a7 2244(b)(2) to filings like Rivers\u2019s would frus-\ntrate, not further, AEDPA\u2019s aims. \n\n25 \n \n \n1. Courts historically analyzed abuses of \nthe writ by reference to appellate re-\nview, not final judgment. \nThe abuse-of-the-writ doctrine was a nineteenth-\ncentury innovation. \u201c[B]y the common law of Eng-\nland, as it stood at the adoption of the constitution,\u201d \nthe denial of habeas relief was \u201cno bar to the issuing \nof a second or third or more writs, by any other court \nor magistrate having jurisdiction of the case.\u201d Ex \nparte Kaine, 14 F. Cas. 78, 80 (C.C.S.D.N.Y. 1853). \nInstead, \u201ccourts and judges were accustomed to exer-\ncise an independent judgment on each successive ap-\nplication, regardless of the number.\u201d Salinger v. \nLoisel, 265 U.S. 224, 231 (1924). Only later, once \u201ca \nright to an appellate review was given,\u201d did American \ncourts pare back this practice. Id. When they did, \nthey tied abuse-of-the-writ rules to the completion of \nappellate review\u2014not the entry of final judgment.  \nEx parte Cuddy, one of the earliest abuse-of-the-\nwrit cases, is a good example. 40 F. 62, 66 (C.C.S.D. \nCal. 1889) (Field, J.). A district court denied Thomas \nCuddy\u2019s habeas petition, and this Court affirmed. Id. \nat 63 (citing Ex parte Cuddy, 131 U.S. 280 (1889)). \nCuddy then sought habeas relief from Justice Field, \nriding circuit. Justice Field ordered the writ dis-\nmissed, reasoning that \u201ca second application upon the \nsame facts \u2026 should not be heard,\u201d absent \u201cleave to \nmake a new application.\u201d Id. at 66.  \nAlong the way, Justice Field emphasized two \nthings. First, \u201caction \u2026 on the second application\u201d \nshould turn on the \u201ccharacter of the court or officer to \nwhom the first application was made, and the full-\nness of the consideration given to it.\u201d Id. In Cuddy, \nfor example, Justice Field rejected the petition be-\ncause the prisoner sought further relief \u201cafter invok-\n\n26 \n \n \ning the judgment of the appellate court\u201d and \u201cfailing \ntherein.\u201d Id. at 64. In other words: the abuse-of-the-\nwrit doctrine applied after this Court weighed in\u2014\nnot after the district court entered final judgment. In \nfact, had the prisoner not \u201cappealed from the refusal \nof the district court,\u201d he could have \u201capplied to the \ncircuit judge\u201d for the same relief. Id. at 66. Second, \nJustice Field \u201crefer[red], of course,\u201d only to \u201ccases \nwhere a second application is made upon the same \nfacts presented, or which might have been presented\u201d \nin the initial application. Id. In his view, things \nwould be \u201centirely different\u201d if \u201csubsequent occurring \nevents\u201d offered \u201cnew\u201d grounds for consideration. Id. \nThis Court\u2019s abuse-of-the-writ cases followed the \nsame approach. Take Salinger, 265 U.S. at 230\u201332, \nwhich involved a serial habeas petitioner. Citing \nCuddy, the Court explained that an appellate court\u2019s \n\u201cprior refusal\u201d to grant a \u201clike application\u201d carries \nweight \u201cwhen a later application is being considered.\u201d \nId. at 230\u201331. Since the \u201cprior refusal\u201d in Salinger \nwas \u201caffirmed in a considered opinion by a Circuit \nCourt of Appeals,\u201d with \u201cno attempt to obtain\u201d further \nreview, an abuse-of-the-writ dismissal \u201cwould have \nbeen well exercised.\u201d Id. at 226\u201327, 232. Here again, \nwhat mattered was that an appellate court had \nweighed in\u2014not that a district court had denied the \nfirst petition and entered final judgment. \nAll of that boils down to this. When early courts \napplied abuse-of-the-writ rules, they asked whether \nan appellate decisionmaker had spoken\u2014not whether \na district court had entered final judgment. That \nmakes sense, since this Court has long understood \n\u201cproceedings in the appellate tribunal\u201d to be part of \nthe \u201cprocess of law\u201d by which prisoners test the legal-\nity of confinement. Frank v. Mangum, 237 U.S. 309, \n\n27 \n \n \n327 (1915) (discussing appellate review of conviction). \nAgainst that backdrop, a rule that treats final judg-\nment as the relevant inflection point is \u201cbad wine of \nrecent vintage.\u201d Rotkiske v. Klemm, 589 U.S. 8, 14 \n(2019) (citing TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U.S. 19, 37 \n(2001) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment)). \n2. Treating filings like Rivers\u2019s as \u201csec-\nond or successive\u201d would frustrate \nAEDPA\u2019s aims. \nBanister\u2019s other source of guidance\u2014\u201cAEDPA\u2019s own \npurposes\u201d\u2014points the same way. 590 U.S. at 512. \nTreating filings like Rivers\u2019s as \u201csecond or successive\u201d \nwould have baleful \u201cimplications for habeas practice,\u201d \nmaking it unlikely that \u201cCongress would have viewed \n[them] as successive.\u201d Id. at 512\u201313. \na. Judicial resources. So far as the lower courts \nare concerned, the question is not whether prisoners \nlike Rivers will seek further relief while their initial \npetitions are on appeal. The question instead is which \ncourt will review those filings first. Everyone agrees \nthat \u201ca three-judge panel of the court of appeals\u201d is \nthe first port of call for petitions filed after a prisoner \nexhausts appellate review of his initial application. \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(B). But Congress had little \nreason to channel filings like Rivers\u2019s down that \npath\u2014and good reason to treat them as part and par-\ncel of the initial habeas application. \ni. If section 2244(b)(2) is a \u201crock[y]\u201d path for prison-\ners, that goes double for courts. Banister, 590 U.S. at \n509. When the court of appeals receives a \u201csecond or \nsuccessive\u201d petition, three appellate judges have to \ndecide\u2014from square zero, and often without adver-\nsarial briefing\u2014whether the new evidence could have \nbeen \u201cdiscovered previously through the exercise of \n\n28 \n \n \ndue diligence.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(B)(i). Then they \nhave to examine \u201cthe evidence as a whole\u201d and de-\ntermine whether \u201cthe facts underlying the claim, if \nproven,\u201d would be \u201csufficient to establish by clear and \nconvincing evidence\u201d that \u201cno reasonable factfinder\u201d \nwould have convicted but for constitutional error. Id. \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2)(B)(ii). That, in turn, means considering \nthe state\u2019s \u201ctheory of the case,\u201d the evidence \u201csup-\nport[ing]\u201d that theory, and the counterfactual effect of \nthe \u201cnewly-discovered evidence,\u201d including how it \nwould have undermined the state\u2019s evidence and in-\nfluenced the theories\u2014and even \u201calternative theo-\nries\u201d\u2014that both sides could have \u201coffered the jury.\u201d \nMunchinski v. Wilson, 694 F.3d 308, 335\u201337 (3d Cir. \n2012). One recent authorization case was pending be-\nfore the Fifth Circuit for almost three years, and the \nopinion features a two-column, sixteen-row chart that \nspans three pages of the Federal Reporter. See In re \nWill, 970 F.3d 536, 544\u201346 (5th Cir. 2020). And that\u2019s \njust the first step. Even when the appellate court au-\nthorizes a \u201csecond or successive\u201d petition, the district \ncourt must still \u201cconduct its own thorough review\u201d to \nensure \u201cthe requirements of \u00a7 2244(b)(2) have been \nsatisfied.\u201d Id. at 543 (citation and quotation marks \nomitted). Still more: because any claim \u201cpresented in \na prior application\u201d must be dismissed, \u00a7 2244(b)(1), \nboth courts must carefully compare the \u201csecond or \nsuccessive\u201d petition to all prior petitions and deter-\nmine precisely what \u201cclaim[s]\u201d have been brought. Id. \nat 541. That can be especially challenging when the \ncourts confront an \u201cinartistically drawn [pro se] peti-\ntion,\u201d Price v. Johnston, 334 U.S. 266, 292 (1948).  \nii. Now consider the alternative. When Rivers \nsought further relief in February 2021, he went be-\nfore the same magistrate judge and district court \njudge who denied his initial petition. Had those judg-\n\n29 \n \n \nes reached the merits, they\u2014better than anyone\u2014\nwould have known whether his new evidence was \nworth the candle. If not: game over. If so, the court \ncould have issued an indicative ruling under Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 62.1. E.g., Parry v. Kerestes, \n2013 WL 6002358 (W.D. Pa. Nov. 12, 2013). Either \nway, a judge \u201cfamiliar with a habeas applicant\u2019s \nclaims\u201d would likely make \u201cquick work\u201d of a filing like \nthis. Banister, 590 U.S. at 517. That\u2019s good reason to \nthink that a Congress concerned about judicial re-\nsources \u201cwould have viewed\u201d such filings as \u201cpart and \nparcel of the first habeas proceeding.\u201d Id. at 507, 513.  \nb. Reducing piecemeal litigation. The latter \npath would serve AEDPA\u2019s second aim too\u2014and this \ncase is Exhibit A. New evidence in hand, Rivers \nasked the Fifth Circuit to remand so that he could \nseek relief on \u201call [his] claims rather than revisiting \nthis case in piecemeal litigation.\u201d No. 18-11490 (5th \nCir.) Dkt. 61, at 5\u20136. When that failed, he asked the \ndistrict court to \u201cconsider an interlocutory review\u201d to \n\u201cprevent unnecessary litigation and to preserve judi-\ncial resources.\u201d No. 7:21-cv-00012 (N.D. Tex.), Dkt. \n26, at 5. Instead, the court transferred the matter to \nthe Fifth Circuit, which opened a brand new proceed-\ning, where Rivers must convince three judges to au-\nthorize a fourth judge to consider whether or not to \nconsider the new evidence. \nc. Finality. Finality cuts the same way. Suppose \nthat the state investigator\u2019s report that Rivers dis-\ncovered in his client file isn\u2019t the bombshell that Riv-\ners reckons. In that case, the way to \u201clend[] finality\u201d \nto Rivers\u2019s conviction \u201cwithin a reasonable time\u201d \nwould have been for the district court to say so in \nSeptember 2021. Banister, 590 U.S. at 512. Had it \ndone that, this case would be over. Instead, the lower \n\n30 \n \n \ncourts sent Rivers and Texas down a path that could \nprolong this case\u2014and leave the validity of Rivers\u2019s \nconviction up in the air\u2014for years to come. \n* \n* \n* \nHad Congress wanted all post-judgment habeas fil-\nings to count as second or successive petitions, \u201cit eas-\nily could have written\u201d such a law. Ali v. Fed. Bureau \nof Prisons, 552 U.S. 214, 227 (2008). But it\u2019s hard to \nsqueeze that rule from the text of \u00a7 2244(b)(2) and the \nhistory against which it was written. And it\u2019s even \nharder to attribute the consequences to a Congress \nfocused on judicial resources, efficiency, and finality. \nSee N.Y. State Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs. v. Dublino, 413 \nU.S. 405, 419\u201320 (1973) (\u201cWe cannot interpret federal \nstatute to negate their own stated purposes.\u201d).  \nB. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision cannot be \nsquared with this Court\u2019s cases. \nThe Fifth Circuit addressed none of this. It did not \nask whether Rivers\u2019s filing \u201cwould have constituted \nan abuse of the writ, as that concept is explained in \n[this Court\u2019s] pre-AEDPA cases.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. \nat 512 (cleaned up) (quoting Panetti, 551 U.S. at 947). \nIt did not explain how its approach would \u201cconserv[e] \njudicial resources\u201d or \u201cstreamlin[e] habeas cases.\u201d Id. \nat 515, 517. And while it offered vague generalities \nabout evading AEDPA\u2019s limitations, it said not a \nword about finality, let alone whether its rule would \nhasten or hinder that objective here. In fact, the court \ndidn\u2019t even cite Banister\u2014even through both parties \nrelied on that case in their briefs. \nNor does the Fifth Circuit\u2019s approach square with \nthis Court\u2019s holdings. Gregory Banister\u2019s Rule 59(e) \nmotion came \u201cafter a final judgment\u201d and raised \u201cha-\nbeas claims,\u201d Pet. App. 10a, but this Court still held \n\n31 \n \n \nthat it was \u201cpart and parcel of the first habeas pro-\nceeding,\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 507. Likewise, the \nprisoner in Slack filed a post-final-judgment habeas \npetition, and this Court allowed that to proceed too. \nSlack, 529 U.S. at 487. And the same was true in \nStewart, where the prisoner\u2019s post-final-judgment \nhabeas application \u201cwas not a \u2018second or successive\u2019 \npetition\u2019 under \u00a7 2244(b).\u201d 523 U.S. at 643\u201345. \nIV. This case is an excellent vehicle. \nThis case is an ideal vehicle to finish what Banister \nstarted. The question presented raises a pure legal \nissue that was fully briefed and squarely decided be-\nlow. There are no preservation problems, alternative \nholdings, or factual disputes that would frustrate re-\nview. And the split is outcome-determinative. The \nFifth Circuit declined to consider Rivers\u2019s new evi-\ndence because it thought \u00a7 2244(b)(2) required that \nresult. Yet if Rivers were held in Buffalo, New York, \ninstead of Beeville, Texas, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) would have \nbeen no barrier, and the lower courts could have \nreached the merits. In other words, if this Court re-\nverses and adopts the Second Circuit\u2019s rule, Rivers \nwill have a meaningful path to relief. The lower \ncourts denied Rivers\u2019s initial petition largely because \nhe could not pinpoint what his counsel should have \ndone differently or how that might have changed \nthings. See Rivers, 2018 WL 4443153, at *4. But the \nnew evidence puts those questions to rest. Now all \nthat stands between Rivers and a fighting chance is \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s mistaken reading of \u00a7 2244(b)(2).  \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should grant the petition. \n \n\n32 \n \n \nRespectfully submitted,  \n \n \nPeter A.

The second petition, dubbed by Rivers as an \nattempt to amend his initial petition, reiterated an \nineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim from his first \npetition as well as raised new habeas claims, again \nchallenging his underlying state convictions. At the \ntime he filed his second petition, the denial of his first \npetition was pending on appeal. \n \n \nIn lieu of Rivers\u2019 question presented, Respondent \nsuggests: \n \n \nDid the Fifth Circuit correctly hold that Rivers\u2019 \npost-judgment motion, which advanced habeas claims \nattacking his underlying convictions, was a successive \nhabeas petition subject to the gatekeeping provisions \nof 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244? \n  \n \n \n\n \nii \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nQuestion Presented ................................................... i \nTable of Contents ..................................................... ii \nIndex of Authorities ................................................. iii \nIntroduction ............................................................. 1 \nOpinions Below ........................................................ 1 \nJurisdiction .............................................................. 1 \nStatutory Provision Involved .................................... 1 \nStatement of the Case .............................................. 3 \nArgument ................................................................. 5 \nI. \nThe \nCourt \nShould \nDeny \nCertiorari \nBecause the Fifth Circuit\u2019s Decision Is \nConsistent with, and Mandated by, This \nCourt\u2019s Cases. .......................................... 5 \nII. \nThe \nCourt \nShould \nDeny \nCertiorari \nBecause the Fifth Circuit\u2019s Decision Is \nConsistent with AEDPA\u2019s Aims. ............ 8 \nIII. \nThe Decision Below Is Fully Consistent \nwith the Majority of Circuit Courts to \nHave Addressed This Issue; the Court \nShould Deny Certiorari to Allow the \nMinority Circuits to Self-Correct. ......... 13 \nConclusion .............................................................. 16 \n \n\n \niii \n \nINDEX OF AUTHORITIES \nCASES \nBanister v.

The court below\u2014and the majority of \nthe circuits\u2014have issued decisions fully consistent \nwith this Court\u2019s precedents and with AEDPA\u2019s clear \npurposes. The circuit majority rule minimizes the \nwaste of judicial resources, restricts piecemeal \nlitigation, and promotes the finality of criminal \nconvictions. \nThe \nremaining \ncircuits\u2014a \nsmall \nminority\u2014should self-correct, especially under the \nguidance of this Court\u2019s more recent decision in \nBanister v. Davis, 590 U.S. 504 (2020). Accordingly, \nRivers should be denied certiorari review. \n \nOPINIONS BELOW \n \nThe opinion of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals is \nreported at Rivers v. Lumpkin, 99 F.4th 216 (5th Cir. \n2024). Pet. App. 1a\u201311a. The district court\u2019s order \nadopting the magistrate judge\u2019s findings, conclusions, \nand \nrecommendation \n(Pet. \nApp. \n12a\u201317a), \nis \nunreported. Pet. App. 18a\u201319a. \n \n \nJURISDICTION \n \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment was entered on April \n15, 2024. Pet. App. 1a. This Court has jurisdiction \nunder the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1254(1) and \n2253(c). \n \nSTATUTORY PROVISION INVOLVED \n \nThe Question Presented involves the application of \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(a)\u2013(b): \n \n(a) No circuit or district judge shall be \n\n \n2 \n \nrequired to entertain an application for a \nwrit of habeas corpus to inquire into the \ndetention of a person pursuant to a \njudgment of a court of the United States \nif it appears that the legality of such \ndetention has been determined by a judge \nor court of the United States on a prior \napplication for a writ of habeas corpus, \nexcept as provided in section 2255. \n \n(b)(1) A claim presented in a second or \nsuccessive habeas corpus application \nunder section 2254 that was presented in \na prior application shall be dismissed. \n \n     (2) A claim presented in a second or \nsuccessive habeas corpus application \nunder \nsection \n2254 \nthat \nwas \nnot \npresented in a prior application shall be \ndismissed unless\u2014 \n(A) the applicant shows that the \nclaim relies on a new rule of \nconstitutional \nlaw, \nmade \nretroactive to cases on collateral \nreview by the Supreme Court, that \nwas previously unavailable; or \n(B)(i) the factual predicate for the \nclaim \ncould \nnot \nhave \nbeen \ndiscovered previously through the \nexercise of due diligence; and \n     (ii) the facts underlying the \nclaim, if proven and viewed in light \nof the evidence as a whole, would \nbe sufficient to establish by clear \nand convincing evidence that, but \n\n \n3 \n \nfor \nconstitutional \nerror, \nno \nreasonable factfinder would have \nfound the applicant guilty of the \nunderlying offense. \n \n    (3)(A) Before a second or successive \napplication permitted by this section is \nfiled in the district court, the applicant \nshall move in the appropriate court of \nappeals for an order authorizing the \ndistrict court to consider the application. \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE  \n \nA Texas jury found Rivers guilty of one count of \ncontinuous sexual abuse of a young child (Count I), two \ncounts of indecency with a child by contact (Counts II \nand III), one count of indecency with a child by \nexposure (Count IV), and two counts of possession of \nchild pornography (Counts V and VI). Rivers v. State, \nNo. 08-12-00145-CR, 2014 WL 3662569 (Tex. App.\u2014El \nPaso Jul. 23, 2014, pet. ref\u2019d). Rivers received \nsentences of thirty years\u2019 incarceration for Count I, \nthree years\u2019 incarceration each for Counts II and III, \nand two years\u2019 incarceration for Count IV, all to run \nconsecutively. Id.  He received two concurrent two-year \nsentences for Counts V and VI. Id. \n \n \nAfter exhausting his available state remedies, \nRivers first sought federal habeas relief in August \n2017. Pet. App. 2a. The district court entered final \njudgment and denied Rivers\u2019 claims on the merits in \nSeptember 2018. Id. Rivers appealed from the denial, \nand the Fifth Circuit granted a certificate of \nappealability on his claim that his trial counsel was \n\n \n4 \n \nineffective for failing to conduct a reasonable \ninvestigation and interview witnesses. Id. The Fifth \nCircuit ultimately affirmed the district court\u2019s final \njudgment in May 2022. Pet. App. 3a.  \n \n \nBack in February 2021, while the appeal of his first \npetition was still pending, Rivers filed a second petition \nto challenge the same convictions. Pet. App. 2a. In the \nsecond petition, Rivers reasserted that his trial counsel \nwas ineffective and added a myriad of new claims. Id. \nRivers alleged that the new claims arose from \ninformation he gleaned from his attorney-client file, \nwhich he obtained in October 2019. Id. The district \ncourt found that it lacked jurisdiction over this petition \nbecause it was \u201csecond or successive\u201d to his previous \npetition and transferred it to the Fifth Circuit Pet. App. \n12a\u201319a. Pursuant to the transfer order, an original \nproceeding was docketed in the Fifth Circuit for Rivers \nto file a motion for authorization to file a successive \nhabeas petition. See In re Rivers, No. 21-10967 (5th Cir. \nSep. 24, 2021); see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3). Instead of \nmoving for authorization, Rivers filed a notice of appeal \nchallenging the district court\u2019s transfer order and \nurged the Fifth Circuit to construe his second petition \nas a motion to amend his first petition. Pet. App. 3a\u2013\n4a. The Fifth Circuit dismissed the authorization \nproceeding because Rivers never filed a supporting \nmotion. Order, In re Rivers, No. 21-10967 (5th Cir. Nov. \n15, 2021).  \n \n \nThe Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s \ntransfer order on April 15, 2024, holding that the \nsecond petition was successive and thus subject to the \nrequirements of \u00a7 2244. Pet. App. 11a. Rivers now \nseeks certiorari to challenge that decision. \n\n \n5 \n \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe Court Should Deny Certiorari Because \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s Decision Is Consistent \nwith, and Mandated by, This Court\u2019s Cases. \n \nCertiorari is unwarranted. The Fifth Circuit \ncorrectly held that Rivers\u2019 second petition is an \nunauthorized successive petition subject to the \nrequirements of \u00a7 2244(b). See Pet. App. 11a. This \nholding is consistent with Gonzalez and Banister. See \nGonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524 (2005) (holding that a \npost-judgment filing is a successive habeas petition if \nit advances habeas claims); Banister v. Davis, 590 U.S. \n504 (holding that a motion to amend or alter a \njudgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) \nis not successive because it is part of the final judgment \nin the initial habeas proceeding). \n \n \nThe restrictions on \u201csecond or successive\u201d federal \nhabeas petitions in \u00a7 2244(b) apply to Rivers\u2019 second \npetition because it challenged the same six-count \njudgment of conviction as his initial petition. See \nMagwood v. Patterson, 561 U.S. 320, 331 (2010) \n(holding that \u00a7 2244(b) applies \u201conly to a \u2018second or \nsuccessive\u2019 application challenging the same state-\ncourt judgment.\u201d). The Fifth Circuit properly relied on \nthis Court\u2019s analysis in Gonzalez to determine whether \nRivers\u2019 post-judgment \u201cmotion to amend\u201d his initial \nhabeas petition, i.e., his second habeas petition, was \n\u201csecond or successive\u201d to his initial habeas petition \nunder \u00a7 2244(b). Pet. App. 9a\u201310a (citing Gonzalez, 545 \nU.S. at 531\u201332). The court below found Rivers\u2019 second \npetition to be successive because it was a post-\njudgment filing that advanced habeas claims. Pet. App. \n\n \n6 \n \n9a\u201310a (\u201c[F]ilings introduced after a final judgment \nthat raise habeas claims, no matter how titled, are \ndeemed successive\u201d) (citing Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 531\u2013\n32). Chronology does not end the inquiry, however, as \nthis Court has clarified that not all habeas filings made \nafter an initial application qualify as \u201csecond or \nsuccessive.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 511\u201312; Magwood, \n561 U.S. at 332; Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U.S. 930, \n944 (2007).  \n \n \nThus, relying on Gonzalez, the Fifth Circuit \nproperly looked \u201cat the nature of the relief sought rather \nthan the filing\u2019s label to determine whether failing to \nsubject \n[Rivers\u2019 \nsecond \npetition] \nto \nthe \nsame \nrequirements would be inconsistent with the statute.\u201d \nPet. App. 10a (quoting Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 531) \n(cleaned up) (emphasis added). Although Rivers\u2019 \nsecond petition was characterized as a motion to \namend and not a Rule 60(b) motion, \u201cthat is a \ndistinction without a difference.\u201d Pet. App. 9a\u201310a \n(citing Gonzalez, 545 U.S. 527). His second petition\u2014\nthough \u201ccouched in the language\u201d of a motion to \namend\u2014was properly construed as a successive \npetition because it both \u201cattack[ed] the federal court\u2019s \nresolution of [his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel] \nclaim on the merits\u201d by raising ineffective assistance of \ncounsel yet again and \u201csought to add [] new grounds for \nrelief.\u201d Pet. App. 10a (citing Gonzalez, 545 U.S. 531\u2013\n32). AEDPA afforded Rivers one chance to challenge \nhis convictions, and he availed of that chance with his \ninitial habeas petition. See Magwood, 561 U.S. at 333\u2013\n34. The court below rightly relied on Gonzalez and saw \nRivers\u2019 second petition for what it was: an attempted \nsecond bite of the proverbial apple and thus subject to \nauthorization requirements of \u00a7 2244(b). The transfer \n\n \n7 \n \norder was not only correct; it was mandated. Failure to \nread Rivers\u2019 second petition in tandem with \u00a7 2244 \nwould have \u201ccircumvent[ed] the requirement that a \nsuccessive habeas petition be precertified by the court \nof appeals as falling within an exception to the \nsuccessive-petition bar.\u201d See Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 532 \n(citation and internal quotation omitted). \n \n \nRivers\u2019 complaint that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision \n\u201cignores this Court\u2019s guidance in Banister\u201d is wholly \nnon-sequitur. Pet. Cert. 13. As in Gonzalez, the final \njudgment of the initial habeas proceeding is the crux of \nthe inquiry in Banister. The Court explicitly \ndistinguished a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend a \njudgment as not subject to \u00a7 2244(b) because the \nmotion suspends the finality of the judgment, and the \nruling on the motion merges into the final judgment, \nthus ultimately making the Rule 59(e) motion \u201cpart \nand parcel\u201d of the initial habeas proceeding. Banister, \n590 U.S. at 507\u201309. This Court\u2019s holding in Gonzalez \nthat a post-judgment filing \u201ccounts as a second or \nsuccessive habeas application if it \u2018attacks the federal \ncourt\u2019s previous resolution of a claim on the merits\u2019 . . . \ndoes not alter that conclusion.\u201d Id. at 505 (citing \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. 532).  \n \n \nLike a Rule 60(b) motion that advances habeas \nclaims and would thus unequivocally count as a \nsuccessive petition, Rivers\u2019 second petition \u201cdiffers \nfrom a Rule 59(e) [motion] in just about every way that \nmatters to the inquiry here.\u201d See Banister, 590 U.S. at \n516. That is, Rivers\u2019 second petition is unlike a Rule \n59(e) motion in timing, scope, and procedural posture. \nA Rule 59(e) motion must be brought within 28 days of \nfinal judgment and requests only \u201creconsideration of \n\n \n8 \n \nmatters properly encompassed\u201d in the challenged \njudgment. Id. at 516. It is a \u201cone-time effort to bring \nalleged errors in a just-issued decision to a habeas \ncourt\u2019s attention, before taking a single appeal.\u201d Id. \nDespite Rivers\u2019 wishes, his second petition cannot be \ntreated akin to a Rule 59(e) motion as \u201cpart and parcel\u201d \nof his initial habeas proceeding because it was: (1) filed \nin a new, separately numbered district court \nproceeding; (2) more than 28 days after final judgment; \nand (3) exceeded the scope of claims that were raised \nin his initial petition. \n \n \nIn sum, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision comports with \nboth Gonzalez and Banister. Certiorari is unwarranted \nbecause this Court has provided sufficient guidance as \nto what constitutes a successive petition, and the lower \ncourt\u2019s analysis correctly relied on that guidance. The \nonly legally available way to merge Rivers\u2019 new habeas \nclaims \ninto \nhis \nfirst-in-time \npetition\u2019s \nalready \ncompleted judgment is a Rule 60(b) motion, which this \nCourt in Gonzalez already established would be a \nsuccessive petition. \n \nII. \nThe Court Should Deny Certiorari Because \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s Decision Is Consistent \nwith AEDPA\u2019s Aims. \n \nRivers argues that the lower court was wrong \nbecause its approach \u201cwould frustrate AEDPA\u2019s aims.\u201d \nPet. Cert. 27. His arguments have no force because he \ndisregards Congress\u2019 intent in enacting \u00a7 2244(b). \nOddly enough, Rivers faults the Fifth Circuit for not \nasking whether his filing \u201cwould have constituted an \nabuse of the writ,\u201d as the historical doctrine is \nexplained in Banister. Pet. Cert. 30 (citing Banister, \n\n \n9 \n \n590 U.S. at 512) (cleaned up). In doing so, Rivers \nsuggests that the abuse-of-the-writ doctrine should \nsupplant \u00a7 2244(b) as gatekeeper. However, this Court \nhas previously explained that the text of AEDPA as \nwritten\u2014and not pre-AEDPA doctrines like abuse of \nthe writ\u2014controls whether a filing is successive. See \nMagwood, 561 U.S. at 338 (\u201cIn light of this complex \nhistory of the phrase \u2018second or successive,\u2019 we must \nrely upon the current text to determine when the \nphrase applies, rather than pre-AEDPA precedents or \nsuperseded statutory formulations.\u201d).  \n \n \nMoreover, the debate over AEDPA reveals that \nCongress likely intended to override the pre-AEDPA \nlegal standards such as abuse of the writ. See, e.g., 141 \nCong. Rec. 15047 (1995) (\u201cWe are into that school that \nsays . . . drastically curtail the time within which \nsomeone is able to file a habeas petition and how many \ntimes they are able to file one and what constitutes a \nsuccessive petition\u201d); accord id. at 15054\u2013055 (\u201c[S]ome \nreform of habeas corpus is necessary. . . . I support \nlimits on successive, repetitive petitions.\u201d). The \nhistorical \nabuse-of-the-writ \ndoctrine \n\u201cwas \nmore \nforgiving than AEDPA\u2019s gatekeeping provision\u201d to the \nextent that successive petitions were a persistent, \nrecurring issue prior to AEDPA\u2019s enactment. See \nBanister, 590 U.S. at 514 (citing McCleskey v. Zant, 499 \nU.S. 467, 485 (1991)); 141 Cong. Rec. 15039 (\u201c[T]he \ncourt as well as the Congress has found that the writs \nof habeas corpus . . . the petition, more accurately, \nseeking a writ, has been used excessively. This has \nbeen happening for many, many years.\u201d). It thus \nfollows that more stringent amendment to \u00a7 2244(b) \nwas Congress\u2019 solution to curtail the problem of \nsuccessive habeas petitions, to serve as gatekeeper \n\n \n10 \n \nwhere the abuse-of-the-writ doctrine failed. The Fifth \nCircuit did not consider whether Rivers\u2019 second \npetition constituted abuse of the writ because the text \nof \u00a7 2244, not abuse of the writ, was the relevant \ninquiry. \n \nA. Congress determined that the application \nof AEDPA\u2019s successive bar conserves \njudicial \nresources, \nwhile \npre-AEDPA \ndoctrines wasted them. \n \nRivers suggests that the procedural impediments of \n\u00a7 2244(b) are, in of themselves, inefficient at conserving \njudicial resources. See Pet. Cert. 27\u201330 (\u201cIf section \n2244(b)(2) is a \u2018rock[y]\u2019 path for prisoners, that goes \ndouble for courts.\u201d) (quoting Banister, 590 U.S. at 509). \nIn other words, he suggests that the plain text of \n\u00a7 2244(b) should not control because the historical pre-\nAEDPA doctrines such as abuse of the writ better \nconserved judicial resources. See id. at 30 (\u201cHad \nCongress wanted all post-judgment habeas filings to \ncount as second or successive petitions, it easily could \nhave written such a law. But it\u2019s hard to squeeze that \nrule from the text of \u00a7 2244(b)(2) and the history \nagainst which it was written.\u201d).  \n \nBut Rivers\u2019 argument is inapposite, because \nCongress concluded that the pre-AEDPA legal \nstandards were inefficient and wasted judicial \nresources. Rivers cannot take issue with Congress\u2019 \npolicy determinations, and neither should the Court. \nSee Felker v. Turpin, 518 U.S. 651, 664 (1996) (\u201c[W]e \nhave likewise recognized that judgments about the \nproper scope of the writ are normally for Congress to \nmake.\u201d). Furthermore, Rivers ignores the fact that a \n\n \n11 \n \ncircuit court\u2019s authorization decision is not itself an \n\u201cappeal,\u201d and cannot be further appealed, either en \nbanc or to this Court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(E) (\u201cThe \ngrant or denial of an authorization by a court of appeals \nto file a second or successive application shall not be \nappealable and shall not be the subject of a petition for \nrehearing or for a writ of certiorari.\u201d). Because this \nlimitation represents the \u201cmaximum\u201d conservation of \njudicial resources, as contemplated by Congress, \nRivers\u2019 arguments necessarily expend more judicial \nresources in comparison. \n \n \nMoreover, it cannot follow that the district court \nshould have issued an indicative ruling on his second \npetition under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62.1 if \nit found that Rivers \u201cnew evidence was [not] worth the \ncandle.\u201d Pet. Cert. 29 (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 62.1). It \nwas the prerogative of the Fifth Circuit to assess the \nbasis of Rivers\u2019 new claims, had he complied with \nAEDPA\u2019s mandate that he move for authorization. See \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b). Such an analysis under \u00a7 2244(b) \nsupplants the ruling Rivers desired under Rule 62.1. \nAs this Court in Banister admonished, the restrictions \nof \u00a7 2244(b), \u201clike all statutes and rules pertaining to \nhabeas, trump any \u2018inconsistent\u2019 Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure \notherwise \napplicable \nto \nhabeas \nproceedings.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 509. This \nargument, too, falters. \n \n \n\n \n12 \n \nB. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s application of \u00a7 2244(b) \ndecreases piecemeal litigation.  \n \n \nRivers argues that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s approach \nincreases piecemeal litigation because the district \ncourt should have considered his second petition on the \nmerits rather than transfer it to the Fifth Circuit. Pet. \nCert. 29. Rivers again suggests that the procedural \nimpediments \nof \n\u00a7 \n2244(b) \nthemselves \npromote \npiecemeal litigation. First, Rivers\u2019 argument fails to \nacknowledge that the district court lacked authority to \nreopen the judgment while the denial of his first \npetition remained pending on appeal because it had no \njurisdiction to consider an \u201camended\u201d petition. Second, \nthe only way Rivers could have reopened the judgment \nto amend his first petition more than 28 days after final \njudgment would have been a Rule 60(b) motion, which \nwould be plainly successive under Gonzalez because it \nincreases piecemeal litigation.   \n \nC. Congress intended for AEDPA and its \nsuccessive bar to promote finality.  \n \n \nRivers argues that if the evidence that formed the \nbasis of his new claims \u201cisn\u2019t the bombshell that Rivers \nreckons,\u201d the district court should have denied the \nclaims in his second petition on the merits. Pet. Cert. \n29 (\u201cHad it done that, this case would be over.\u201d). But \nbecause the district court lacked jurisdiction to \nconsider the second petition, \u00a7 2244(b) required that \nthe court transfer it to the Fifth Circuit. Yet again, he \nsuggests that the procedural requirements of \u00a7 2244(b) \nare themselves impediments to conviction finality. Id. \nat 29\u201330 (\u201cInstead, the lower courts sent Rivers and \nTexas down a path that could prolong this case.\u201d).  \n\n \n13 \n \n \nIn enacting \u00a7 2244(b), Congress \u201caimed to prevent \nserial challenges to a judgment of conviction.\u201d Banister, \n590 U.S. at 515. Yet Rivers\u2019 proposed approach would \nallow petitioners to make an infinite number of post-\njudgment \u201camendments\u201d to an initial petition so long \nas that petition remains pending on appeal. See id. at \n521. Allowing petitioners to raise habeas claims ad \ninfinitum during the post-judgment pendency of the \ninitial petition runs contrary to \u00a7 2244(b)\u2019s purpose to \n\u201c\u2018conserve judicial resources, reduc[e] piecemeal \nlitigation,\u2019 and \u2018lend[ ] finality to state court judgments \nwithin a reasonable time.\u2019\u201d Id. at 512 (citing Panetti, \n551 U.S. at 945\u201346). In sum, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision \nbelow aligns with AEDPA and Congress\u2019 intent \ntherein. \n \nIII. \nThe Decision Below Is Fully Consistent \nwith the Majority of Circuit Courts to Have \nAddressed This Issue; the Court Should \nDeny Certiorari to Allow the Minority \nCircuits to Self-Correct. \n \nThe rule followed by the majority of circuits is \ncorrect, for the reasons explained above. The Fifth \nCircuit, along with the Fourth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, \nand Eleventh Circuits, all agree that an initial habeas \nproceeding is \u201cconcluded\u201d once the district court has \nissued a final judgment, regardless of a pending \nappeal; any later attempts to advance habeas claims \nare deemed succe\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n43: 20241015114816247_23-134520Rivers20Word20Count20Cert.json (score: 0.288)\nNo. 23-1345 \n \n \nIN THE \nSupreme Court of the United States \n \nDANNY RICHARD RIVERS, \nPetitioner, \nv. \n \nBOBBY LUMPKIN, DIRECTOR, TDCJ-CID,  \nRespondent. \n \nOn Petition for a Writ of Certiorari \nTo the Fifth Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit \n \nRESPONDENT\u2019S WORD COUNT CERTIFICATION \n \n \nAs required by Supreme Court Rule 33.1(h), I certify that the document \ncontains 3,965 words, excluding the parts of the document that are exempted \nby Supreme Court Rule 33.1(d).

The court below\u2014and the majority of \nthe circuits\u2014have issued decisions fully consistent \nwith this Court\u2019s precedents and with AEDPA\u2019s clear \npurposes. The circuit majority rule minimizes the \nwaste of judicial resources, restricts piecemeal \nlitigation, and promotes the finality of criminal \nconvictions. \nThe \nremaining \ncircuits\u2014a \nsmall \nminority\u2014should self-correct, especially under the \nguidance of this Court\u2019s more recent decision in \nBanister v. Davis, 590 U.S. 504 (2020). Accordingly, \nRivers should be denied certiorari review. \n \nOPINIONS BELOW \n \nThe opinion of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals is \nreported at Rivers v. Lumpkin, 99 F.4th 216 (5th Cir. \n2024). Pet. App. 1a\u201311a. The district court\u2019s order \nadopting the magistrate judge\u2019s findings, conclusions, \nand \nrecommendation \n(Pet. \nApp. \n12a\u201317a), \nis \nunreported. Pet. App. 18a\u201319a. \n \n \nJURISDICTION \n \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment was entered on April \n15, 2024. Pet. App. 1a. This Court has jurisdiction \nunder the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1254(1) and \n2253(c). \n \nSTATUTORY PROVISION INVOLVED \n \nThe Question Presented involves the application of \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(a)\u2013(b): \n \n(a) No circuit or district judge shall be \n\n \n2 \n \nrequired to entertain an application for a \nwrit of habeas corpus to inquire into the \ndetention of a person pursuant to a \njudgment of a court of the United States \nif it appears that the legality of such \ndetention has been determined by a judge \nor court of the United States on a prior \napplication for a writ of habeas corpus, \nexcept as provided in section 2255. \n \n(b)(1) A claim presented in a second or \nsuccessive habeas corpus application \nunder section 2254 that was presented in \na prior application shall be dismissed. \n \n     (2) A claim presented in a second or \nsuccessive habeas corpus application \nunder \nsection \n2254 \nthat \nwas \nnot \npresented in a prior application shall be \ndismissed unless\u2014 \n(A) the applicant shows that the \nclaim relies on a new rule of \nconstitutional \nlaw, \nmade \nretroactive to cases on collateral \nreview by the Supreme Court, that \nwas previously unavailable; or \n(B)(i) the factual predicate for the \nclaim \ncould \nnot \nhave \nbeen \ndiscovered previously through the \nexercise of due diligence; and \n     (ii) the facts underlying the \nclaim, if proven and viewed in light \nof the evidence as a whole, would \nbe sufficient to establish by clear \nand convincing evidence that, but \n\n \n3 \n \nfor \nconstitutional \nerror, \nno \nreasonable factfinder would have \nfound the applicant guilty of the \nunderlying offense. \n \n    (3)(A) Before a second or successive \napplication permitted by this section is \nfiled in the district court, the applicant \nshall move in the appropriate court of \nappeals for an order authorizing the \ndistrict court to consider the application. \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE  \n \nA Texas jury found Rivers guilty of one count of \ncontinuous sexual abuse of a young child (Count I), two \ncounts of indecency with a child by contact (Counts II \nand III), one count of indecency with a child by \nexposure (Count IV), and two counts of possession of \nchild pornography (Counts V and VI). Rivers v. State, \nNo. 08-12-00145-CR, 2014 WL 3662569 (Tex. App.\u2014El \nPaso Jul. 23, 2014, pet. ref\u2019d). Rivers received \nsentences of thirty years\u2019 incarceration for Count I, \nthree years\u2019 incarceration each for Counts II and III, \nand two years\u2019 incarceration for Count IV, all to run \nconsecutively. Id.  He received two concurrent two-year \nsentences for Counts V and VI. Id. \n \n \nAfter exhausting his available state remedies, \nRivers first sought federal habeas relief in August \n2017. Pet. App. 2a. The district court entered final \njudgment and denied Rivers\u2019 claims on the merits in \nSeptember 2018. Id. Rivers appealed from the denial, \nand the Fifth Circuit granted a certificate of \nappealability on his claim that his trial counsel was \n\n \n4 \n \nineffective for failing to conduct a reasonable \ninvestigation and interview witnesses. Id. The Fifth \nCircuit ultimately affirmed the district court\u2019s final \njudgment in May 2022. Pet. App. 3a.  \n \n \nBack in February 2021, while the appeal of his first \npetition was still pending, Rivers filed a second petition \nto challenge the same convictions. Pet. App. 2a. In the \nsecond petition, Rivers reasserted that his trial counsel \nwas ineffective and added a myriad of new claims. Id. \nRivers alleged that the new claims arose from \ninformation he gleaned from his attorney-client file, \nwhich he obtained in October 2019. Id. The district \ncourt found that it lacked jurisdiction over this petition \nbecause it was \u201csecond or successive\u201d to his previous \npetition and transferred it to the Fifth Circuit Pet. App. \n12a\u201319a. Pursuant to the transfer order, an original \nproceeding was docketed in the Fifth Circuit for Rivers \nto file a motion for authorization to file a successive \nhabeas petition. See In re Rivers, No. 21-10967 (5th Cir. \nSep. 24, 2021); see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3). Instead of \nmoving for authorization, Rivers filed a notice of appeal \nchallenging the district court\u2019s transfer order and \nurged the Fifth Circuit to construe his second petition \nas a motion to amend his first petition. Pet. App. 3a\u2013\n4a. The Fifth Circuit dismissed the authorization \nproceeding because Rivers never filed a supporting \nmotion. Order, In re Rivers, No. 21-10967 (5th Cir. Nov. \n15, 2021).  \n \n \nThe Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s \ntransfer order on April 15, 2024, holding that the \nsecond petition was successive and thus subject to the \nrequirements of \u00a7 2244. Pet. App. 11a. Rivers now \nseeks certiorari to challenge that decision. \n\n \n5 \n \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe Court Should Deny Certiorari Because \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s Decision Is Consistent \nwith, and Mandated by, This Court\u2019s Cases. \n \nCertiorari is unwarranted. The Fifth Circuit \ncorrectly held that Rivers\u2019 second petition is an \nunauthorized successive petition subject to the \nrequirements of \u00a7 2244(b). See Pet. App. 11a. This \nholding is consistent with Gonzalez and Banister. See \nGonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524 (2005) (holding that a \npost-judgment filing is a successive habeas petition if \nit advances habeas claims); Banister v. Davis, 590 U.S. \n504 (holding that a motion to amend or alter a \njudgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) \nis not successive because it is part of the final judgment \nin the initial habeas proceeding). \n \n \nThe restrictions on \u201csecond or successive\u201d federal \nhabeas petitions in \u00a7 2244(b) apply to Rivers\u2019 second \npetition because it challenged the same six-count \njudgment of conviction as his initial petition. See \nMagwood v. Patterson, 561 U.S. 320, 331 (2010) \n(holding that \u00a7 2244(b) applies \u201conly to a \u2018second or \nsuccessive\u2019 application challenging the same state-\ncourt judgment.\u201d). The Fifth Circuit properly relied on \nthis Court\u2019s analysis in Gonzalez to determine whether \nRivers\u2019 post-judgment \u201cmotion to amend\u201d his initial \nhabeas petition, i.e., his second habeas petition, was \n\u201csecond or successive\u201d to his initial habeas petition \nunder \u00a7 2244(b). Pet. App. 9a\u201310a (citing Gonzalez, 545 \nU.S. at 531\u201332). The court below found Rivers\u2019 second \npetition to be successive because it was a post-\njudgment filing that advanced habeas claims. Pet. App. \n\n \n6 \n \n9a\u201310a (\u201c[F]ilings introduced after a final judgment \nthat raise habeas claims, no matter how titled, are \ndeemed successive\u201d) (citing Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 531\u2013\n32). Chronology does not end the inquiry, however, as \nthis Court has clarified that not all habeas filings made \nafter an initial application qualify as \u201csecond or \nsuccessive.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 511\u201312; Magwood, \n561 U.S. at 332; Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U.S. 930, \n944 (2007).  \n \n \nThus, relying on Gonzalez, the Fifth Circuit \nproperly looked \u201cat the nature of the relief sought rather \nthan the filing\u2019s label to determine whether failing to \nsubject \n[Rivers\u2019 \nsecond \npetition] \nto \nthe \nsame \nrequirements would be inconsistent with the statute.\u201d \nPet. App. 10a (quoting Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 531) \n(cleaned up) (emphasis added). Although Rivers\u2019 \nsecond petition was characterized as a motion to \namend and not a Rule 60(b) motion, \u201cthat is a \ndistinction without a difference.\u201d Pet. App. 9a\u201310a \n(citing Gonzalez, 545 U.S. 527). His second petition\u2014\nthough \u201ccouched in the language\u201d of a motion to \namend\u2014was properly construed as a successive \npetition because it both \u201cattack[ed] the federal court\u2019s \nresolution of [his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel] \nclaim on the merits\u201d by raising ineffective assistance of \ncounsel yet again and \u201csought to add [] new grounds for \nrelief.\u201d Pet. App. 10a (citing Gonzalez, 545 U.S. 531\u2013\n32). AEDPA afforded Rivers one chance to challenge \nhis convictions, and he availed of that chance with his \ninitial habeas petition. See Magwood, 561 U.S. at 333\u2013\n34. The court below rightly relied on Gonzalez and saw \nRivers\u2019 second petition for what it was: an attempted \nsecond bite of the proverbial apple and thus subject to \nauthorization requirements of \u00a7 2244(b). The transfer \n\n \n7 \n \norder was not only correct; it was mandated. Failure to \nread Rivers\u2019 second petition in tandem with \u00a7 2244 \nwould have \u201ccircumvent[ed] the requirement that a \nsuccessive habeas petition be precertified by the court \nof appeals as falling within an exception to the \nsuccessive-petition bar.\u201d See Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 532 \n(citation and internal quotation omitted). \n \n \nRivers\u2019 complaint that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision \n\u201cignores this Court\u2019s guidance in Banister\u201d is wholly \nnon-sequitur. Pet. Cert. 13. As in Gonzalez, the final \njudgment of the initial habeas proceeding is the crux of \nthe inquiry in Banister. The Court explicitly \ndistinguished a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend a \njudgment as not subject to \u00a7 2244(b) because the \nmotion suspends the finality of the judgment, and the \nruling on the motion merges into the final judgment, \nthus ultimately making the Rule 59(e) motion \u201cpart \nand parcel\u201d of the initial habeas proceeding. Banister, \n590 U.S. at 507\u201309. This Court\u2019s holding in Gonzalez \nthat a post-judgment filing \u201ccounts as a second or \nsuccessive habeas application if it \u2018attacks the federal \ncourt\u2019s previous resolution of a claim on the merits\u2019 . . . \ndoes not alter that conclusion.\u201d Id. at 505 (citing \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. 532).  \n \n \nLike a Rule 60(b) motion that advances habeas \nclaims and would thus unequivocally count as a \nsuccessive petition, Rivers\u2019 second petition \u201cdiffers \nfrom a Rule 59(e) [motion] in just about every way that \nmatters to the inquiry here.\u201d See Banister, 590 U.S. at \n516. That is, Rivers\u2019 second petition is unlike a Rule \n59(e) motion in timing, scope, and procedural posture. \nA Rule 59(e) motion must be brought within 28 days of \nfinal judgment and requests only \u201creconsideration of \n\n \n8 \n \nmatters properly encompassed\u201d in the challenged \njudgment. Id. at 516. It is a \u201cone-time effort to bring \nalleged errors in a just-issued decision to a habeas \ncourt\u2019s attention, before taking a single appeal.\u201d Id. \nDespite Rivers\u2019 wishes, his second petition cannot be \ntreated akin to a Rule 59(e) motion as \u201cpart and parcel\u201d \nof his initial habeas proceeding because it was: (1) filed \nin a new, separately numbered district court \nproceeding; (2) more than 28 days after final judgment; \nand (3) exceeded the scope of claims that were raised \nin his initial petition. \n \n \nIn sum, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision comports with \nboth Gonzalez and Banister. Certiorari is unwarranted \nbecause this Court has provided sufficient guidance as \nto what constitutes a successive petition, and the lower \ncourt\u2019s analysis correctly relied on that guidance. The \nonly legally available way to merge Rivers\u2019 new habeas \nclaims \ninto \nhis \nfirst-in-time \npetition\u2019s \nalready \ncompleted judgment is a Rule 60(b) motion, which this \nCourt in Gonzalez already established would be a \nsuccessive petition. \n \nII. \nThe Court Should Deny Certiorari Because \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s Decision Is Consistent \nwith AEDPA\u2019s Aims. \n \nRivers argues that the lower court was wrong \nbecause its approach \u201cwould frustrate AEDPA\u2019s aims.\u201d \nPet. Cert. 27. His arguments have no force because he \ndisregards Congress\u2019 intent in enacting \u00a7 2244(b). \nOddly enough, Rivers faults the Fifth Circuit for not \nasking whether his filing \u201cwould have constituted an \nabuse of the writ,\u201d as the historical doctrine is \nexplained in Banister. Pet. Cert. 30 (citing Banister, \n\n \n9 \n \n590 U.S. at 512) (cleaned up). In doing so, Rivers \nsuggests that the abuse-of-the-writ doctrine should \nsupplant \u00a7 2244(b) as gatekeeper. However, this Court \nhas previously explained that the text of AEDPA as \nwritten\u2014and not pre-AEDPA doctrines like abuse of \nthe writ\u2014controls whether a filing is successive. See \nMagwood, 561 U.S. at 338 (\u201cIn light of this complex \nhistory of the phrase \u2018second or successive,\u2019 we must \nrely upon the current text to determine when the \nphrase applies, rather than pre-AEDPA precedents or \nsuperseded statutory formulations.\u201d).  \n \n \nMoreover, the debate over AEDPA reveals that \nCongress likely intended to override the pre-AEDPA \nlegal standards such as abuse of the writ. See, e.g., 141 \nCong. Rec. 15047 (1995) (\u201cWe are into that school that \nsays . . . drastically curtail the time within which \nsomeone is able to file a habeas petition and how many \ntimes they are able to file one and what constitutes a \nsuccessive petition\u201d); accord id. at 15054\u2013055 (\u201c[S]ome \nreform of habeas corpus is necessary. . . . I support \nlimits on successive, repetitive petitions.\u201d). The \nhistorical \nabuse-of-the-writ \ndoctrine \n\u201cwas \nmore \nforgiving than AEDPA\u2019s gatekeeping provision\u201d to the \nextent that successive petitions were a persistent, \nrecurring issue prior to AEDPA\u2019s enactment. See \nBanister, 590 U.S. at 514 (citing McCleskey v. Zant, 499 \nU.S. 467, 485 (1991)); 141 Cong. Rec. 15039 (\u201c[T]he \ncourt as well as the Congress has found that the writs \nof habeas corpus . . . the petition, more accurately, \nseeking a writ, has been used excessively. This has \nbeen happening for many, many years.\u201d). It thus \nfollows that more stringent amendment to \u00a7 2244(b) \nwas Congress\u2019 solution to curtail the problem of \nsuccessive habeas petitions, to serve as gatekeeper \n\n \n10 \n \nwhere the abuse-of-the-writ doctrine failed. The Fifth \nCircuit did not consider whether Rivers\u2019 second \npetition constituted abuse of the writ because the text \nof \u00a7 2244, not abuse of the writ, was the relevant \ninquiry. \n \nA. Congress determined that the application \nof AEDPA\u2019s successive bar conserves \njudicial \nresources, \nwhile \npre-AEDPA \ndoctrines wasted them. \n \nRivers suggests that the procedural impediments of \n\u00a7 2244(b) are, in of themselves, inefficient at conserving \njudicial resources. See Pet. Cert. 27\u201330 (\u201cIf section \n2244(b)(2) is a \u2018rock[y]\u2019 path for prisoners, that goes \ndouble for courts.\u201d) (quoting Banister, 590 U.S. at 509). \nIn other words, he suggests that the plain text of \n\u00a7 2244(b) should not control because the historical pre-\nAEDPA doctrines such as abuse of the writ better \nconserved judicial resources. See id. at 30 (\u201cHad \nCongress wanted all post-judgment habeas filings to \ncount as second or successive petitions, it easily could \nhave written such a law. But it\u2019s hard to squeeze that \nrule from the text of \u00a7 2244(b)(2) and the history \nagainst which it was written.\u201d).  \n \nBut Rivers\u2019 argument is inapposite, because \nCongress concluded that the pre-AEDPA legal \nstandards were inefficient and wasted judicial \nresources. Rivers cannot take issue with Congress\u2019 \npolicy determinations, and neither should the Court. \nSee Felker v. Turpin, 518 U.S. 651, 664 (1996) (\u201c[W]e \nhave likewise recognized that judgments about the \nproper scope of the writ are normally for Congress to \nmake.\u201d). Furthermore, Rivers ignores the fact that a \n\n \n11 \n \ncircuit court\u2019s authorization decision is not itself an \n\u201cappeal,\u201d and cannot be further appealed, either en \nbanc or to this Court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(E) (\u201cThe \ngrant or denial of an authorization by a court of appeals \nto file a second or successive application shall not be \nappealable and shall not be the subject of a petition for \nrehearing or for a writ of certiorari.\u201d). Because this \nlimitation represents the \u201cmaximum\u201d conservation of \njudicial resources, as contemplated by Congress, \nRivers\u2019 arguments necessarily expend more judicial \nresources in comparison. \n \n \nMoreover, it cannot follow that the district court \nshould have issued an indicative ruling on his second \npetition under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62.1 if \nit found that Rivers \u201cnew evidence was [not] worth the \ncandle.\u201d Pet. Cert. 29 (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 62.1). It \nwas the prerogative of the Fifth Circuit to assess the \nbasis of Rivers\u2019 new claims, had he complied with \nAEDPA\u2019s mandate that he move for authorization. See \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b). Such an analysis under \u00a7 2244(b) \nsupplants the ruling Rivers desired under Rule 62.1. \nAs this Court in Banister admonished, the restrictions \nof \u00a7 2244(b), \u201clike all statutes and rules pertaining to \nhabeas, trump any \u2018inconsistent\u2019 Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure \notherwise \napplicable \nto \nhabeas \nproceedings.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 509. This \nargument, too, falters. \n \n \n\n \n12 \n \nB. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s application of \u00a7 2244(b) \ndecreases piecemeal litigation.  \n \n \nRivers argues that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s approach \nincreases piecemeal litigation because the district \ncourt should have considered his second petition on the \nmerits rather than transfer it to the Fifth Circuit. Pet. \nCert. 29. Rivers again suggests that the procedural \nimpediments \nof \n\u00a7 \n2244(b) \nthemselves \npromote \npiecemeal litigation. First, Rivers\u2019 argument fails to \nacknowledge that the district court lacked authority to \nreopen the judgment while the denial of his first \npetition remained pending on appeal because it had no \njurisdiction to consider an \u201camended\u201d petition. Second, \nthe only way Rivers could have reopened the judgment \nto amend his first petition more than 28 days after final \njudgment would have been a Rule 60(b) motion, which \nwould be plainly successive under Gonzalez because it \nincreases piecemeal litigation.   \n \nC. Congress intended for AEDPA and its \nsuccessive bar to promote finality.  \n \n \nRivers argues that if the evidence that formed the \nbasis of his new claims \u201cisn\u2019t the bombshell that Rivers \nreckons,\u201d the district court should have denied the \nclaims in his second petition on the merits. Pet. Cert. \n29 (\u201cHad it done that, this case would be over.\u201d). But \nbecause the district court lacked jurisdiction to \nconsider the second petition, \u00a7 2244(b) required that \nthe court transfer it to the Fifth Circuit. Yet again, he \nsuggests that the procedural requirements of \u00a7 2244(b) \nare themselves impediments to conviction finality. Id. \nat 29\u201330 (\u201cInstead, the lower courts sent Rivers and \nTexas down a path that could prolong this case.\u201d).  \n\n \n13 \n \n \nIn enacting \u00a7 2244(b), Congress \u201caimed to prevent \nserial challenges to a judgment of conviction.\u201d Banister, \n590 U.S. at 515. Yet Rivers\u2019 proposed approach would \nallow petitioners to make an infinite number of post-\njudgment \u201camendments\u201d to an initial petition so long \nas that petition remains pending on appeal. See id. at \n521. Allowing petitioners to raise habeas claims ad \ninfinitum during the post-judgment pendency of the \ninitial petition runs contrary to \u00a7 2244(b)\u2019s purpose to \n\u201c\u2018conserve judicial resources, reduc[e] piecemeal \nlitigation,\u2019 and \u2018lend[ ] finality to state court judgments \nwithin a reasonable time.\u2019\u201d Id. at 512 (citing Panetti, \n551 U.S. at 945\u201346). In sum, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision \nbelow aligns with AEDPA and Congress\u2019 intent \ntherein. \n \nIII. \nThe Decision Below Is Fully Consistent \nwith the Majority of Circuit Courts to Have \nAddressed This Issue; the Court Should \nDeny Certiorari to Allow the Minority \nCircuits to Self-Correct. \n \nThe rule followed by the majority of circuits is \ncorrect, for the reasons explained above. The Fifth \nCircuit, along with the Fourth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, \nand Eleventh Circuits, all agree that an initial habeas \nproceeding is \u201cconcluded\u201d once the district court has \nissued a final judgment, regardless of a pending \nappeal; any later attempts to advance habeas claims \nare deemed successive under \u00a7 2244(b). See Bixby v. \nStirling, 90 F.4th 140 (4th Cir. 2024); Phillips v. United \nStates, 668 F.3d 433, 435 (7th Cir. 2012); Williams v. \nNorris, 461 F.3d 999, 1003 (8th Cir. 2006); Beaty v. \nSchriro, 554 F.3d 780, 783 n.1 (9th Cir. 2009); Ochoa v. \nSirmons, 485 F.3d 538, 540 (10th Cir. 2007); Boyd v. \n\n \n14 \n \nSec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corr., 114 F.4th 1232, 1239 (11th Cir. \n2024). \n \n \nThe Fourth and Eleventh Circuits most recently \nissued clear decisions aligning with the majority view. \nBixby, 90 F.4th at 146\u201350 (relying on Gonzalez, the \nFourth Circuit determined this year that under \nAEDPA, only it may authorize a second or successive \nhabeas petition); Boyd, 114 F.4th at 1239 (finding that, \neven if filed during an appeal for an adjudicated \n\u201cearlier application,\u201d a habeas petition or motion \u201cthat \npresents new evidence in support of a claim\u201d should be \ndeemed \nsuccessive \nand \n\u201c\u2018treated \naccordingly.\u2019\u201d) \n(quoting Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 531). This position\u2014\nthat upon a final judgment by the district court, if a \npetitioner wishes to present new claims or new \nevidence for old claims during the pendency of an \nappeal, AEDPA grants only the circuit courts the \npower to authorize. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). \n \n \nThe Seventh Circuit, along with the Eighth and \nNinth, have had long-standing views on this issue, \nfinding that upon an appeal, a habeas petitioner\u2019s \nadditional claims would be successive. Phillips, 668 \nF.3d at 435; Williams v. Norris, 461 F.3d at 1003; Beaty \nv. Schriro, 554 F.3d at 783 n.1. As the Seventh Circuit \nwarned, ruling otherwise would allow a petitioner to \n\u201cfile[] an entirely independent \u00a7 2255 petition raising a \ndistinct claim of relief; indeed, he could still file one or \nmore, as many as he likes, because this appeal is not \nover.\u201d Phillips, 668 F.3d at 435. As such, \u201c[t]reating \nmotions filed during appeal as part of the original \napplication,\u201d would potentially \u201cdrain most force from \nthe time-and-number limits,\u201d of AEDPA. Id. A district \n\n \n15 \n \ncourt\u2019s final judgment, therefore, must \u201cmark[] the \nterminal point.\u201d Id. \n \n \nBy contrast, only the Second and Third Circuits \nhave ruled that a petition is not successive if filed \nduring the pendency of the initial petition\u2019s appeal.  \nWhab v. United States, 408 F.3d 116, 118 (2d Cir. \n2005); United States v. Santarelli, 929 F.3d 95, 106 (3d \nCir. 2019) (holding that a prior proceeding has not \nconcluded for purposes of \u00a7 2244(b) until all appeals \nhave been exhausted.).  \n \n \nTo strengthen his circuit-split argument, Rivers \nasserts that the Tenth Circuit applies a \u201cseven-factor \ntest\u201d to determine if a petitioner may supplement an \ninitial petition before the district court rendered \njudgment. Pet. Cert. 19\u201320. In Douglas v. Workman, \n560 F.3d 1156 (10th Cir. 2009), the Tenth Circuit \ncarved out an exception for prosecutorial misconduct \nclaims to its normal rule concerning AEDPA\u2019s bar of \nsuccessive petitions. Specifically, when the \u201cprosecutor \nacted \nwillfully, \nand \nnot \njust \nnegligently \nor \ninadvertently, \nhis \nconduct \nwarrants \nspecial \ncondemnation and justifies permitting [the petitioner] \nto supplement his initial habeas petition.\u201d Id. at 1190. \nThat court then laid out \u201cseven factors on which [it \nbased \nits] \nconclusion\u201d \nthat \na \npetitioner \nmay \nsupplement. Id. at 1190\u201396. But to be clear, the Tenth \nCircuit has explicitly declined to follow the Second \nCircuit\u2019s position detailed in Whab, 408 F.3d 116, for \nmost second petitions filed during the appeal of the \ninitial habeas petition. Ochoa, 485 F.3d at 540. Indeed, \nthe Tenth Circuit stated that the minority rule \u201cwould \ngreatly undermine the policy against piecemeal \nlitigation embodied in \u00a7 2244(b).\u201d Id. \n\n \n16 \n \n \nNevertheless, there is a mature circuit split on \nwhether \u00a7 2244(b) applies to post-judgment motions \nfiled when the initial habeas application is pending on \nappeal. Moreover, this is a jurisdictional question, and \nthis Court has repeatedly described the importance of \nclear jurisdictional rules. See, e.g., Lapides v. Bd. of \nRegents of Univ. Sys. Of Georgia, 535 U.S. 613, 621 \n(2002). Thus, this could be a sufficient basis to justify \ncertiorari, even if only to affirm the majority rule. \n \n \nOn the other hand, the circuits are not \u201cintractably\u201d \nsplit as Rivers claims, nor is it certain that \u201cthe conflict \nwon\u2019t disappear on its own.\u201d See Pet. Cert. 2. Even \nlooking at Rivers\u2019 assertions more favorably, all of the \ncourts that do or could take the minority view\u2014the \nSecond, Third, and Tenth Circuits\u2014lacked the \nguidance and historical examination of AEDPA from \nthis Court\u2019s intervening decision in Banister. See, e.g., \nWhab, 408 F.3d at 118 (decided fifteen years prior to \nBanister); Santarelli, 929 F.3d at 106 (decided one year \nprior); Douglas, 560 F.3d at 1196 (decided eleven years \nprior). Certiorari is unwarranted at this stage because \nthe minority circuits have yet to self-correct. This \nCould should grant certiorari only if they fail to do so \nat the next opportunity. \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nBased on the foregoing reasons, the petition for a \nwrit of certiorari should be denied. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n17 \n \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \nKEN PAXTON \n \nAttorney General of Texas \n \n \n \nBRENT WEBSTER \n \nFirst Assistant Attorney \n \nGeneral \n \n \n \nJOSH RENO \n \nDeputy Attorney General for \n \nCriminal Justice \n \n \n \nEDWARD L.

This is the single most important document to analyze at this stage.\n\nDesign EIG is moderate (0.5) because while retrieving the petition is a fundamental and crucial step in any SCOTUS case analysis, it's not a novel or complex strategic maneuver. Successfully executing this action reinforces the core design principle that analysis must begin with primary source documents, which is a valuable but foundational lesson for the agent's overall strategy.\n\nThe joint EIG is high because the immense value for the specific task, combined with its role in validating a core part of the analysis process, makes this an extremely informative action.",

Davis, 590 U.S. \n504, 509 (2020). After that, the stringent gatekeeping \nrequirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2) bar nearly all \nattempts to file a \u201csecond or successive habeas corpus \napplication.\u201d Here, petitioner sought to amend his in-\nitial habeas application while it was pending on ap-\npeal. The Fifth Circuit applied \u00a7 2244(b)(2) and re-\njected the amended filing. \nThe circuits are intractably split on whether \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies to such filings. The Fifth, Sixth, \nSeventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits hold \nthat \u00a7 2244(b)(2) categorically applies to all second-\nin-time habeas filings made after the district court \nenters final judgment. The Second Circuit disagrees, \napplying \u00a7 2244(b)(2) only after a petitioner exhausts \nappellate review of his initial petition. And the Third \nand Tenth Circuits exempt some second-in-time fil-\nings from \u00a7 2244(b)(2), depending on whether a pris-\noner prevails on his initial appeal (Third Circuit) or \nsatisfies a seven-factor test (Tenth Circuit). \nThe question presented is: \nWhether \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies (i) only to habeas fil-\nings made after a prisoner has exhausted appellate \nreview of his first petition, (ii) to all second-in-time \nhabeas filings after final judgment, or (iii) to some \nsecond-in-time filings, depending on a prisoner\u2019s suc-\ncess on appeal or ability to satisfy a seven-factor test. \n \n\nii \n \nRELATED PROCEEDINGS \nEx parte Rivers, WR-84,550-01 & 84,550-02 (Tex. \nCt.

Nine cir-\ncuits have split four ways over that question, and on-\nly this Court can resolve the conflict. \n1. This case is about the hurdles that a prisoner \nmust clear before a court will hear him out. Petitioner \nDanny Rivers sought habeas relief, arguing that his \ncounsel had failed to investigate his case and had \nshown up to trial drunk. The district court denied the \npetition, finding that Rivers couldn\u2019t explain what his \nlawyer should have done differently or why that \nwould have changed things. But the answer soon \nemerged. After fighting for years to obtain his coun-\nsel\u2019s records, Rivers finally received them while his \ninitial petition was up on appeal. Among the files, \nRivers found an exculpatory report suggesting that \nhe was wrongly convicted\u2014evidence that his lawyers \nnever once mentioned at trial.  \nNew evidence in hand, Rivers raced to court\u2014only \nto find the doors barred. Applying \u00a7 2244(b)(2), the \ndistrict court reasoned that it was \u201cwithout jurisdic-\ntion to entertain\u201d the new evidence because Rivers\u2019s \nfiling counted as a \u201csecond or successive\u201d petition. \nPet. App. 19a. (Never mind that his first petition was \nstill pending on appeal and would be for nearly a \nyear.) The Fifth Circuit affirmed, explaining that \u201cfil-\nings introduced after a final judgment that raise ha-\nbeas claims\u201d are \u201cdeemed successive.\u201d Pet. App. 10a. \n\n2 \n \n \n2. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision deepens a circuit con-\nflict over when \u00a7 2244(b)(2) kicks in. In the Second \nCircuit, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) doesn\u2019t apply until a prisoner \nhas exhausted appellate review of his initial habeas \npetition\u2014leaving district courts free to consider a fil-\ning like Rivers\u2019s. As then-Judge Sotomayor put it, \nthat approach guarantees \u201cone full opportunity to \nseek collateral review.\u201d Ching v. United States, 298 \nF.3d 174, 177 (2d Cir. 2002). But the Fifth Circuit ex-\npressly \u201cdecline[d] \u2026 to embrace\u201d that rule. Pet. App. \n10a. Instead, it joined the Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, \nNinth, and Eleventh Circuits in applying \u00a7 2244(b)(2) \nafter the district court enters final judgment. That \napproach effectively grants \u201cone full opportunity to \nseek collateral review in the district court.\u201d United \nStates v. Santarelli, 929 F.3d 95, 104 (3d Cir. 2019) \n(cleaned up). Meanwhile, the Third and Tenth Cir-\ncuits follow their own unique approaches, holding \nthat \u00a7 2244(b)(2) sometimes applies between final \njudgment and exhaustion and sometimes doesn\u2019t. \nThree circuits have already denied rehearing en banc, \nand the rest show no sign of rethinking their views. \nIn short: the circuits are intractably split, the con-\nflict won\u2019t disappear on its own, and this Court\u2019s \nguidance is badly needed. See Balbuena v. Sullivan, \n970 F.3d 1176, 1197, 1200 (9th Cir. 2020) (Fletcher, \nJ., concurring in the result) (\u201curg[ing] the Supreme \nCourt to recognize\u201d and \u201cresolve the conflict\u201d).  \n3. The decision below is also wrong. In Banister v. \nDavis, 590 U.S. 504 (2020), this Court explained that \nthe phrase \u201csecond or successive\u201d is a term of art that \ndoesn\u2019t simply refer to every second-in-time habeas \nfiling. Instead, the Court has looked to historical \npractice and statutory aims when determining \nwhether \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies. But the Fifth Circuit \n\n3 \n \n \ndidn\u2019t even cite Banister, let alone follow its guidance. \nHad it done so, the court would have realized that its \nrule doesn\u2019t square with history. Early courts analyz-\ning abuses of the writ treated appellate review\u2014not \nfinal judgment\u2014as the relevant inflection point. \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s approach will also frustrate \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2)\u2019s aims. At bottom, the question is not \nwhether prisoners like Rivers will try to bring new \nevidence to the courts\u2019 attention. (They will\u2014no mat-\nter what rule this Court adopts.) The question in-\nstead is which court will consider that evidence first. \nUnder the Second Circuit\u2019s approach, a filing like \nRivers\u2019s would have gone to the district court that \njust denied the initial petition: the single member of \nArticle III most familiar with the case. That judge \ncould then have weighed the new evidence and decid-\ned whether to issue an indicative ruling under Feder-\nal Rule of Civil Procedure 62.1. By contrast, the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s rule requires Rivers to ask a brand-new \nthree-judge panel for permission to ask the district \ncourt to consider whether or not to reach the merits. \nIt\u2019s hard to squeeze that rule from the statutory \ntext\u2014and harder still to attribute it to a Congress fo-\ncused on judicial economy, efficiency, and finality. \n4. The question presented is important, and this \ncase is an ideal vehicle. Until this Court weighs in, at \nleast some states and prisoners will be living under \nthe wrong rule, and those in the outstanding circuits \nwill have to guess which rule applies. The interests \non both sides are too critical to leave up to geograph-\nical chance. The split is also outcome-determinative \nhere: if Rivers were incarcerated in New York instead \nof Texas, courts would have considered the new evi-\ndence, giving him a meaningful path to relief. \nThe Court should grant review. \n\n4 \n \n \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe court of appeals\u2019 opinion is reported at 99 F.4th \n216 and is reproduced in the appendix to this petition \nat Pet. App. 1a\u201311a. The district court\u2019s opinion is \nunpublished but is available at 2021 WL 4319670 and \nis reproduced at Pet. App. 12a\u201317a. \nJURISDICTION \nThe Fifth Circuit issued its judgment on April 15, \n2024. Pet. App. 1a. This Court has jurisdiction under \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISION INVOLVED \nSection 2244(b)(2) of Title 28, U.S. Code, provides: \nA claim presented in a second or successive ha-\nbeas corpus application under section 2254 that \nwas not presented in a prior application shall be \ndismissed unless\u2014 \n(A) the applicant shows that the claim relies on \na new rule of constitutional law, made retroac-\ntive to cases on collateral review by the Su-\npreme Court, that was previously unavailable; \nor \n(B)(i) the factual predicate for the claim could \nnot have been discovered previously through \nthe exercise of due diligence; and \n(ii) the facts underlying the claim, if proven \nand viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, \nwould be sufficient to establish by clear and \nconvincing evidence that, but for constitutional \nerror, no reasonable factfinder would have \nfound the applicant guilty of the underlying of-\nfense. \n\n5 \n \n \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal background \n1. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty \nAct of 1996 creates a dual-track system for federal \nhabeas relief. One path is for first-time petitioners. \n\u201cUnder AEDPA, a state prisoner always gets one \nchance to bring a federal habeas challenge to his con-\nviction.\u201d Banister v. Davis, 590 U.S. 504, 509 (2020). \nThis path begins in the district court. If that court \ndenies relief, the prisoner may request a \u201ccertificate \nof appealability\u201d\u2014initially from the district court, \nand then from the court of appeals. See Gonzalez v. \nThaler, 565 U.S. 134, 140 & n.5 (2012). The path ends \nonly when the prisoner has exhausted the chance to \nappeal and seek certiorari. \nThe second path is \u201crockier.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at \n509. A prisoner who wants to file a \u201csecond or succes-\nsive \nhabeas \ncorpus \napplication,\u201d \n28 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2), must first ask the court of appeals for \n\u201can order authorizing the district court to consider \nthe application,\u201d id. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). The appellate \ncourt may oblige only if the prisoner makes a \u201cprima \nfacie showing,\u201d id. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(C), that the petition \n\u201crelies on a new and retroactive rule of constitutional \nlaw\u201d or \u201calleges previously undiscoverable facts that \nwould establish \u2026 innocence,\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at \n509 (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2)). If so, the petition \ngoes to the district court, which must decide for itself \nwhether the petition \u201csatisfies the requirements\u201d of \n\u00a7 2244. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(4). At the same time, be-\ncause any claim \u201cpresented in a prior application\u201d \nmust be dismissed, \u00a7 2244(b)(1), both courts must \ncarefully compare the new petition to all prior peti-\ntions to determine precisely what \u201cclaims\u201d the prison-\n\n6 \n \n \ner has brought. Only then\u2014after all that is done\u2014\nmay the district court reach the merits. \nThe upshot is that much rides on whether \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies\u2014that is: on whether a filing is \ndeemed \u201cpart and parcel of the first habeas proceed-\ning,\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 507, or instead a \u201csecond \nor successive habeas corpus application,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2).  \n2. The phrase \u201csecond or successive\u201d is a \u201cterm of \nart\u201d that does not refer simply to \u201call habeas filings \u2026 \nfollowing an initial application.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at \n511 (first quoting Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, \n486 (2000), then quoting Magwood, 561 U.S. at 332 \n(2010)). To determine when \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies, \u201cthis \nCourt has looked for guidance in two main places.\u201d \nId. at 512. First, the Court has considered history: \n\u201cwhether a type of later-in-time filing would have \nconstituted an abuse of the writ\u201d under the Court\u2019s  \n\u201cpre-AEDPA cases.\u201d Id. (cleaned up) (quoting Panetti \nv. Quarterman, 551 U.S. 930, 947 (2007)). Second, the \nCourt has looked to \u201cAEDPA\u2019s own purposes\u201d: con-\nserving judicial resources, reducing piecemeal litiga-\ntion, and achieving finality \u201cwithin a reasonable \ntime.\u201d Id. (citing Panetti, 551 U.S. at 945\u201346). \nB. Factual and procedural background \nDanny Rivers has spent the last twelve years \nfighting to prove his innocence. Along the way, he \ndiscovered that exculpatory evidence had been sitting \nin his trial counsel\u2019s files all the while\u2014evidence that \nhis lawyers could have used to clear his name. If Riv-\ners is right, then he not only received ineffective as-\nsistance but was also wrongly convicted. This case is \nabout the procedural hurdles that Rivers must clear \nbefore a court will hear him out. \n\n7 \n \n \n1. Rivers is tried and convicted \nIn 2012, a Texas jury convicted Rivers of sexually \nabusing his children and possessing child pornogra-\nphy. He is currently serving a 38-year sentence. \na. This case began amidst a bitter divorce. In 2008, \na Texas judge awarded Rivers temporary custody of \nhis 9-year-old daughter. Rivers v. Lumpkin, No. 7:21-\ncv-00012 (N.D. Tex.), Dkt. 11-14 (\u201cR-1\u201d), at 156, 164. \nThe court also granted Rivers sole use of the family \nhome, ordered his ex-wife to pay child support, and \ndenied her request for alimony. Id. Dkt. 11-15 (\u201cR-2\u201d), \nat 15. In response, Rivers\u2019s ex-wife \u201cpunish[ed]\u201d him \nby \u201cnot letting him see\u201d his 12-year-old stepdaughter, \nwhom he had raised as his own. R-2, at 16. \nThe following year, with custody arrangements un-\nchanged, Rivers\u2019s ex-wife drove the children to the \npolice station while Rivers was away for work. Both \ngirls met with officers and accused Rivers of sexually \nabusing them. R-2, at 18, 129. Police then searched \nRivers\u2019s home, seized the family laptop, and launched \na monthslong forensic examination, eventually identi-\nfying \u201ctwo files of interest\u201d that \u201cappeared to be child \npornography.\u201d Id. at 26, 28; id. Dkt. 11-10 (\u201cR-3\u201d), at \n13, 31, 73; id. Dkt. 11-16, at 15, 66\u201367. \nb. A Wichita County, Texas grand jury indicted \nRivers for continuous sexual abuse, indecency with a \nchild, and two counts of possessing child pornogra-\nphy. R-3, at 8\u201315. Rivers, who had no prior criminal \nhistory, R-2, at 161, pleaded not guilty. \nWith his trial looming, Rivers moved to sever the \nchild-pornography counts, arguing that they might \ncolor the jury\u2019s views on the other charges. R-1, at 15. \nThe state opposed severance. Because its case had \n\u201cno DNA or physical evidence,\u201d Texas argued that the \n\n8 \n \n \nalleged child pornography was \u201cnecessary\u201d to estab-\nlish Rivers\u2019s \u201cmotive\u201d and \u201cattraction to young girls.\u201d \nId. at 14\u201315. The court refused to sever. Id. at 23. \nc. At trial, Rivers\u2019s daughter and stepdaughter al-\nleged a staggering pattern of sexual abuse. R-1, at \n142, 145\u2013146, 167\u2013168. They further claimed that \nRivers had shown them child pornography at least \nseventy times, testifying that he had \u201cdownloaded \nmultiple videos\u201d and played different films on differ-\nent occasions. Id. at 153, 172. Rivers\u2019s daughter also \naccused her father of secretly recording images in the \nshower. R-1, at 170. (No hidden cameras were ever \nfound.) All told, the girls alleged over 200 instances of \nshocking abuse, many of which reportedly took place \nin common areas of the home while their mother, un-\ncle, or cousin were also present in the house. R-1, at \n139, 147, 152\u201353, 156, 158, 166; R-2, at 12, 90. No \nother witnesses saw the alleged abuse, and no physi-\ncal evidence corroborated the story. R-2, at 34, 64. \nGiven the lack of supporting evidence, the alleged \nchild pornography was a key issue at trial. The prose-\ncution called multiple witnesses to testify about the \ntwo files\u2014a single image and a single video\u2014that \nRivers was charged with possessing. R-2, at 19, 28, \n44, 74, 84, 100. While the trial judge had granted a \ncontinuance so the defense could obtain its own fo-\nrensic experts, R-3, at 31, 40, counsel did not do so. \nR-2, at 112. Instead, the defense called only a single \nwitness, who testified that Rivers was out of town \nwhen the files were allegedly downloaded. R-2, at \n113\u2013114, 131. \nd. The jury convicted Rivers on all charges, Pet. \nApp. 2a. It rejected the prosecution\u2019s call for a 169-\nyear sentence, however, and recommended that the \ncourt sentence Rivers to 42 years instead. R-3, at \n\n9 \n \n \n213\u201314, 221\u201329. The court went lower still: 38 years \nbehind bars, all counts considered\u2014just three years \nabove the minimum. Pet. App. 13a. The Texas Court \nof Appeals affirmed. \n2. Rivers seeks postconviction relief \na. In 2013, Rivers began asking his lawyers to send \nhim his client file. He explained: \u201cI don\u2019t know what \nall it contains, but it looks like I\u2019m going to have to do \nthis thing pro se, so I need everything I can get.\u201d \nNo. 7:21-cv-00012 (N.D. Tex.) Dkt. 15-11, at 67. \nCounsel \u201cnever responded to [his] request,\u201d and two \nyears later, Rivers was still trying. Id. at 68\u201369. He \neventually resorted to filing a formal grievance with \nthe Texas state bar. \nMeanwhile, Rivers pressed forward with what rec-\nords he had. In 2016, he sought state postconviction \nrelief based on ineffective assistance, among other \ngrounds. Relevant here, he argued that his trial \ncounsel had failed to \u201cper\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Davis, 590 U.S. \n504, 509 (2020). After that, the stringent gatekeeping \nrequirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2) bar nearly all \nattempts to file a \u201csecond or successive habeas corpus \napplication.\u201d Here, petitioner sought to amend his in-\nitial habeas application while it was pending on ap-\npeal. The Fifth Circuit applied \u00a7 2244(b)(2) and re-\njected the amended filing. \nThe circuits are intractably split on whether \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies to such filings. The Fifth, Sixth, \nSeventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits hold \nthat \u00a7 2244(b)(2) categorically applies to all second-\nin-time habeas filings made after the district court \nenters final judgment. The Second Circuit disagrees, \napplying \u00a7 2244(b)(2) only after a petitioner exhausts \nappellate review of his initial petition. And the Third \nand Tenth Circuits exempt some second-in-time fil-\nings from \u00a7 2244(b)(2), depending on whether a pris-\noner prevails on his initial appeal (Third Circuit) or \nsatisfies a seven-factor test (Tenth Circuit). \nThe question presented is: \nWhether \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies (i) only to habeas fil-\nings made after a prisoner has exhausted appellate \nreview of his first petition, (ii) to all second-in-time \nhabeas filings after final judgment, or (iii) to some \nsecond-in-time filings, depending on a prisoner\u2019s suc-\ncess on appeal or ability to satisfy a seven-factor test. \n \n\nii \n \nRELATED PROCEEDINGS \nEx parte Rivers, WR-84,550-01 & 84,550-02 (Tex. \nCt.

Nine cir-\ncuits have split four ways over that question, and on-\nly this Court can resolve the conflict. \n1. This case is about the hurdles that a prisoner \nmust clear before a court will hear him out. Petitioner \nDanny Rivers sought habeas relief, arguing that his \ncounsel had failed to investigate his case and had \nshown up to trial drunk. The district court denied the \npetition, finding that Rivers couldn\u2019t explain what his \nlawyer should have done differently or why that \nwould have changed things. But the answer soon \nemerged. After fighting for years to obtain his coun-\nsel\u2019s records, Rivers finally received them while his \ninitial petition was up on appeal. Among the files, \nRivers found an exculpatory report suggesting that \nhe was wrongly convicted\u2014evidence that his lawyers \nnever once mentioned at trial.  \nNew evidence in hand, Rivers raced to court\u2014only \nto find the doors barred. Applying \u00a7 2244(b)(2), the \ndistrict court reasoned that it was \u201cwithout jurisdic-\ntion to entertain\u201d the new evidence because Rivers\u2019s \nfiling counted as a \u201csecond or successive\u201d petition. \nPet. App. 19a. (Never mind that his first petition was \nstill pending on appeal and would be for nearly a \nyear.) The Fifth Circuit affirmed, explaining that \u201cfil-\nings introduced after a final judgment that raise ha-\nbeas claims\u201d are \u201cdeemed successive.\u201d Pet. App. 10a. \n\n2 \n \n \n2. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision deepens a circuit con-\nflict over when \u00a7 2244(b)(2) kicks in. In the Second \nCircuit, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) doesn\u2019t apply until a prisoner \nhas exhausted appellate review of his initial habeas \npetition\u2014leaving district courts free to consider a fil-\ning like Rivers\u2019s. As then-Judge Sotomayor put it, \nthat approach guarantees \u201cone full opportunity to \nseek collateral review.\u201d Ching v. United States, 298 \nF.3d 174, 177 (2d Cir. 2002). But the Fifth Circuit ex-\npressly \u201cdecline[d] \u2026 to embrace\u201d that rule. Pet. App. \n10a. Instead, it joined the Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, \nNinth, and Eleventh Circuits in applying \u00a7 2244(b)(2) \nafter the district court enters final judgment. That \napproach effectively grants \u201cone full opportunity to \nseek collateral review in the district court.\u201d United \nStates v. Santarelli, 929 F.3d 95, 104 (3d Cir. 2019) \n(cleaned up). Meanwhile, the Third and Tenth Cir-\ncuits follow their own unique approaches, holding \nthat \u00a7 2244(b)(2) sometimes applies between final \njudgment and exhaustion and sometimes doesn\u2019t. \nThree circuits have already denied rehearing en banc, \nand the rest show no sign of rethinking their views. \nIn short: the circuits are intractably split, the con-\nflict won\u2019t disappear on its own, and this Court\u2019s \nguidance is badly needed. See Balbuena v. Sullivan, \n970 F.3d 1176, 1197, 1200 (9th Cir. 2020) (Fletcher, \nJ., concurring in the result) (\u201curg[ing] the Supreme \nCourt to recognize\u201d and \u201cresolve the conflict\u201d).  \n3. The decision below is also wrong. In Banister v. \nDavis, 590 U.S. 504 (2020), this Court explained that \nthe phrase \u201csecond or successive\u201d is a term of art that \ndoesn\u2019t simply refer to every second-in-time habeas \nfiling. Instead, the Court has looked to historical \npractice and statutory aims when determining \nwhether \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies. But the Fifth Circuit \n\n3 \n \n \ndidn\u2019t even cite Banister, let alone follow its guidance. \nHad it done so, the court would have realized that its \nrule doesn\u2019t square with history. Early courts analyz-\ning abuses of the writ treated appellate review\u2014not \nfinal judgment\u2014as the relevant inflection point. \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s approach will also frustrate \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2)\u2019s aims. At bottom, the question is not \nwhether prisoners like Rivers will try to bring new \nevidence to the courts\u2019 attention. (They will\u2014no mat-\nter what rule this Court adopts.) The question in-\nstead is which court will consider that evidence first. \nUnder the Second Circuit\u2019s approach, a filing like \nRivers\u2019s would have gone to the district court that \njust denied the initial petition: the single member of \nArticle III most familiar with the case. That judge \ncould then have weighed the new evidence and decid-\ned whether to issue an indicative ruling under Feder-\nal Rule of Civil Procedure 62.1. By contrast, the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s rule requires Rivers to ask a brand-new \nthree-judge panel for permission to ask the district \ncourt to consider whether or not to reach the merits. \nIt\u2019s hard to squeeze that rule from the statutory \ntext\u2014and harder still to attribute it to a Congress fo-\ncused on judicial economy, efficiency, and finality. \n4. The question presented is important, and this \ncase is an ideal vehicle. Until this Court weighs in, at \nleast some states and prisoners will be living under \nthe wrong rule, and those in the outstanding circuits \nwill have to guess which rule applies. The interests \non both sides are too critical to leave up to geograph-\nical chance. The split is also outcome-determinative \nhere: if Rivers were incarcerated in New York instead \nof Texas, courts would have considered the new evi-\ndence, giving him a meaningful path to relief. \nThe Court should grant review. \n\n4 \n \n \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe court of appeals\u2019 opinion is reported at 99 F.4th \n216 and is reproduced in the appendix to this petition \nat Pet. App. 1a\u201311a. The district court\u2019s opinion is \nunpublished but is available at 2021 WL 4319670 and \nis reproduced at Pet. App. 12a\u201317a. \nJURISDICTION \nThe Fifth Circuit issued its judgment on April 15, \n2024. Pet. App. 1a. This Court has jurisdiction under \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISION INVOLVED \nSection 2244(b)(2) of Title 28, U.S. Code, provides: \nA claim presented in a second or successive ha-\nbeas corpus application under section 2254 that \nwas not presented in a prior application shall be \ndismissed unless\u2014 \n(A) the applicant shows that the claim relies on \na new rule of constitutional law, made retroac-\ntive to cases on collateral review by the Su-\npreme Court, that was previously unavailable; \nor \n(B)(i) the factual predicate for the claim could \nnot have been discovered previously through \nthe exercise of due diligence; and \n(ii) the facts underlying the claim, if proven \nand viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, \nwould be sufficient to establish by clear and \nconvincing evidence that, but for constitutional \nerror, no reasonable factfinder would have \nfound the applicant guilty of the underlying of-\nfense. \n\n5 \n \n \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal background \n1. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty \nAct of 1996 creates a dual-track system for federal \nhabeas relief. One path is for first-time petitioners. \n\u201cUnder AEDPA, a state prisoner always gets one \nchance to bring a federal habeas challenge to his con-\nviction.\u201d Banister v. Davis, 590 U.S. 504, 509 (2020). \nThis path begins in the district court. If that court \ndenies relief, the prisoner may request a \u201ccertificate \nof appealability\u201d\u2014initially from the district court, \nand then from the court of appeals. See Gonzalez v. \nThaler, 565 U.S. 134, 140 & n.5 (2012). The path ends \nonly when the prisoner has exhausted the chance to \nappeal and seek certiorari. \nThe second path is \u201crockier.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at \n509. A prisoner who wants to file a \u201csecond or succes-\nsive \nhabeas \ncorpus \napplication,\u201d \n28 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2), must first ask the court of appeals for \n\u201can order authorizing the district court to consider \nthe application,\u201d id. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). The appellate \ncourt may oblige only if the prisoner makes a \u201cprima \nfacie showing,\u201d id. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(C), that the petition \n\u201crelies on a new and retroactive rule of constitutional \nlaw\u201d or \u201calleges previously undiscoverable facts that \nwould establish \u2026 innocence,\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at \n509 (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2)). If so, the petition \ngoes to the district court, which must decide for itself \nwhether the petition \u201csatisfies the requirements\u201d of \n\u00a7 2244. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(4). At the same time, be-\ncause any claim \u201cpresented in a prior application\u201d \nmust be dismissed, \u00a7 2244(b)(1), both courts must \ncarefully compare the new petition to all prior peti-\ntions to determine precisely what \u201cclaims\u201d the prison-\n\n6 \n \n \ner has brought. Only then\u2014after all that is done\u2014\nmay the district court reach the merits. \nThe upshot is that much rides on whether \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies\u2014that is: on whether a filing is \ndeemed \u201cpart and parcel of the first habeas proceed-\ning,\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 507, or instead a \u201csecond \nor successive habeas corpus application,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2).  \n2. The phrase \u201csecond or successive\u201d is a \u201cterm of \nart\u201d that does not refer simply to \u201call habeas filings \u2026 \nfollowing an initial application.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at \n511 (first quoting Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, \n486 (2000), then quoting Magwood, 561 U.S. at 332 \n(2010)). To determine when \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies, \u201cthis \nCourt has looked for guidance in two main places.\u201d \nId. at 512. First, the Court has considered history: \n\u201cwhether a type of later-in-time filing would have \nconstituted an abuse of the writ\u201d under the Court\u2019s  \n\u201cpre-AEDPA cases.\u201d Id. (cleaned up) (quoting Panetti \nv. Quarterman, 551 U.S. 930, 947 (2007)). Second, the \nCourt has looked to \u201cAEDPA\u2019s own purposes\u201d: con-\nserving judicial resources, reducing piecemeal litiga-\ntion, and achieving finality \u201cwithin a reasonable \ntime.\u201d Id. (citing Panetti, 551 U.S. at 945\u201346). \nB. Factual and procedural background \nDanny Rivers has spent the last twelve years \nfighting to prove his innocence. Along the way, he \ndiscovered that exculpatory evidence had been sitting \nin his trial counsel\u2019s files all the while\u2014evidence that \nhis lawyers could have used to clear his name. If Riv-\ners is right, then he not only received ineffective as-\nsistance but was also wrongly convicted. This case is \nabout the procedural hurdles that Rivers must clear \nbefore a court will hear him out. \n\n7 \n \n \n1. Rivers is tried and convicted \nIn 2012, a Texas jury convicted Rivers of sexually \nabusing his children and possessing child pornogra-\nphy. He is currently serving a 38-year sentence. \na. This case began amidst a bitter divorce. In 2008, \na Texas judge awarded Rivers temporary custody of \nhis 9-year-old daughter. Rivers v. Lumpkin, No. 7:21-\ncv-00012 (N.D. Tex.), Dkt. 11-14 (\u201cR-1\u201d), at 156, 164. \nThe court also granted Rivers sole use of the family \nhome, ordered his ex-wife to pay child support, and \ndenied her request for alimony. Id. Dkt. 11-15 (\u201cR-2\u201d), \nat 15. In response, Rivers\u2019s ex-wife \u201cpunish[ed]\u201d him \nby \u201cnot letting him see\u201d his 12-year-old stepdaughter, \nwhom he had raised as his own. R-2, at 16. \nThe following year, with custody arrangements un-\nchanged, Rivers\u2019s ex-wife drove the children to the \npolice station while Rivers was away for work. Both \ngirls met with officers and accused Rivers of sexually \nabusing them. R-2, at 18, 129. Police then searched \nRivers\u2019s home, seized the family laptop, and launched \na monthslong forensic examination, eventually identi-\nfying \u201ctwo files of interest\u201d that \u201cappeared to be child \npornography.\u201d Id. at 26, 28; id. Dkt. 11-10 (\u201cR-3\u201d), at \n13, 31, 73; id. Dkt. 11-16, at 15, 66\u201367. \nb. A Wichita County, Texas grand jury indicted \nRivers for continuous sexual abuse, indecency with a \nchild, and two counts of possessing child pornogra-\nphy. R-3, at 8\u201315. Rivers, who had no prior criminal \nhistory, R-2, at 161, pleaded not guilty. \nWith his trial looming, Rivers moved to sever the \nchild-pornography counts, arguing that they might \ncolor the jury\u2019s views on the other charges. R-1, at 15. \nThe state opposed severance. Because its case had \n\u201cno DNA or physical evidence,\u201d Texas argued that the \n\n8 \n \n \nalleged child pornography was \u201cnecessary\u201d to estab-\nlish Rivers\u2019s \u201cmotive\u201d and \u201cattraction to young girls.\u201d \nId. at 14\u201315. The court refused to sever. Id. at 23. \nc. At trial, Rivers\u2019s daughter and stepdaughter al-\nleged a staggering pattern of sexual abuse. R-1, at \n142, 145\u2013146, 167\u2013168. They further claimed that \nRivers had shown them child pornography at least \nseventy times, testifying that he had \u201cdownloaded \nmultiple videos\u201d and played different films on differ-\nent occasions. Id. at 153, 172. Rivers\u2019s daughter also \naccused her father of secretly recording images in the \nshower. R-1, at 170. (No hidden cameras were ever \nfound.) All told, the girls alleged over 200 instances of \nshocking abuse, many of which reportedly took place \nin common areas of the home while their mother, un-\ncle, or cousin were also present in the house. R-1, at \n139, 147, 152\u201353, 156, 158, 166; R-2, at 12, 90. No \nother witnesses saw the alleged abuse, and no physi-\ncal evidence corroborated the story. R-2, at 34, 64. \nGiven the lack of supporting evidence, the alleged \nchild pornography was a key issue at trial. The prose-\ncution called multiple witnesses to testify about the \ntwo files\u2014a single image and a single video\u2014that \nRivers was charged with possessing. R-2, at 19, 28, \n44, 74, 84, 100. While the trial judge had granted a \ncontinuance so the defense could obtain its own fo-\nrensic experts, R-3, at 31, 40, counsel did not do so. \nR-2, at 112. Instead, the defense called only a single \nwitness, who testified that Rivers was out of town \nwhen the files were allegedly downloaded. R-2, at \n113\u2013114, 131. \nd. The jury convicted Rivers on all charges, Pet. \nApp. 2a. It rejected the prosecution\u2019s call for a 169-\nyear sentence, however, and recommended that the \ncourt sentence Rivers to 42 years instead. R-3, at \n\n9 \n \n \n213\u201314, 221\u201329. The court went lower still: 38 years \nbehind bars, all counts considered\u2014just three years \nabove the minimum. Pet. App. 13a. The Texas Court \nof Appeals affirmed. \n2. Rivers seeks postconviction relief \na. In 2013, Rivers began asking his lawyers to send \nhim his client file. He explained: \u201cI don\u2019t know what \nall it contains, but it looks like I\u2019m going to have to do \nthis thing pro se, so I need everything I can get.\u201d \nNo. 7:21-cv-00012 (N.D. Tex.) Dkt. 15-11, at 67. \nCounsel \u201cnever responded to [his] request,\u201d and two \nyears later, Rivers was still trying. Id. at 68\u201369. He \neventually resorted to filing a formal grievance with \nthe Texas state bar. \nMeanwhile, Rivers pressed forward with what rec-\nords he had. In 2016, he sought state postconviction \nrelief based on ineffective assistance, among other \ngrounds. Relevant here, he argued that his trial \ncounsel had failed to \u201cperform an objectively reasona-\nble investigation\u201d or \u201cverify the ages of the persons\u201d \nin the alleged child pornography. No. 7:21-cv-00012 \n(N.D. Tex.), Dkt. 12-21, at 9. He added that his lead \ncounsel was \u201cinebriated\u201d at the trial. Id. at 11. \nThe Texas Court of Criminal Appeals found that \nRivers had \u201calleged facts that, if true, might entitle \nhim to relief.\u201d Ex parte Rivers, 2016 WL 5800277, at \n*1 (Tex. Crim. App. Oct. 5, 2016). It remanded for \nfurther factfinding, ordering the court to appoint \ncounsel if it \u201celect[ed] to hold a hearing.\u201d Id. Judge \nAlcala wrote separately to urge the appointment of \ncounsel \u201cregardless of whether the trial court holds a \nhearing.\u201d Id. (Alcala, J., concurring). \nOn remand, the trial court neither held a hearing \nnor appointed counsel. Instead, it chiefly relied on af-\n\n10 \n \n \nfidavits in which trial counsel defended their perfor-\nmance, denied any drunkenness, and claimed that \nRivers had \u201cadmitted to [them] that he engaged in \nsexual acts with the victims.\u201d Rivers v. Davis, 2018 \nWL 4443153, at *3 (N.D. Tex. July 27, 2018); see also \nNo. 7:17-cv-00124 (N.D. Tex.), Dkt. 24-1, at 24. Rivers \nresponded with his own affidavit, categorically \u201cde-\nny[ing] making such admissions.\u201d Id. at 2. He also \nsubmitted a text message from one of the lawyers\u2019 \nspouses, confirming that counsel \u201cshowed up intoxi-\ncated for court,\u201d id. at 25, and a news report showing \nthat his lead counsel was arrested six months before \nthe trial \u201cafter showing up at a woman[\u2019]s house na-\nked and drunk,\u201d id. at 33 (cleaned up) (quoting Tex-\noma, Local Attorney Sentenced to Two Years Proba-\ntion (Mar. 18, 2015), bit.ly/Barber-Arrest). The trial \ncourt nonetheless \u201cconcluded that counsel were not \nineffective,\u201d and the Court of Criminal Appeals af-\nfirmed. Ex parte Rivers, 2017 WL 3380491, at *1 \n(Tex. Crim. App. June 7, 2017). \nb. Rivers sought federal habeas relief in August \n2017, raising the same ineffective-assistance claims, \namong other grounds. No. 7:17-cv-00124 (N.D. Tex.), \nDkt. 1, at 6. The district court denied Rivers\u2019s habeas \npetition and declined to grant a certificate of appeal-\nability. Pet. App. 2a. Rivers then sought a certificate \nof appealability from the Fifth Circuit. \n3. While his habeas appeal is pending, \nRivers obtains exculpatory evidence \na. While his case was pending on appeal, Rivers fi-\nnally received the client file that he first requested in \n2013. Pet. App. 2a. In it, he found a state investiga-\ntor\u2019s report analyzing the two files underlying his \nchild-pornography conviction. The report called the \nvideo merely \u201cof interest,\u201d without further comment. \n\n11 \n \n \nMeanwhile, the image was labeled \u201cNOT CHILD \nPORN.\u201d No. 7:21-cv-00012 (N.D. Tex.), Dkt. 15-11, at \n75\u201377. The report also listed a number of other files \nfound on the family laptop. Next to one\u2014entitled  \n\u201creallyunderagekiddieporn\u201d\u2014the state investigator \nhad written: \u201calthough the title indicated it to be \nchild porn,\u201d it \u201cis not.\u201d Id. at 75. Another, whose title \nincluded phrases like \u201cpre-teen tiny children\u201d and \n\u201cincest sex porn underage,\u201d was also marked \u201cNOT \nCHILD PORN.\u201d Id. Most telling of all, these files \nand the video \u201cof interest\u201d were not saved under Riv-\ners\u2019s name; they were instead recovered from a down-\nload folder bearing the name of Rivers\u2019s ex-wife. \nAfter discovering the investigator\u2019s report, Rivers \nmoved to supplement the appellate record. See \nNo. 18-11490 (5th Cir.), Dkt. 27. He also filed an affi-\ndavit stating that he had never seen the report and \nnoting that his lawyers had \u201cfailed to raise this ex-\nculpatory evidence\u201d that had been \u201cin [their] posses-\nsion\u201d all along. Id. at 5, 10\u201311. The affidavit added \nthat Rivers\u2019s \u201cestranged wife had access to the house \nand did in fact enter the house, against court orders, \nwhile [Rivers] was out of town during the time frame \nthe alleged child porn was downloaded,\u201d id. at 7\u2014one \nexplanation for why the \u201cchild pornography\u201d ap-\npeared under her username, not his. \nThe Fifth Circuit denied Rivers\u2019s motion to supple-\nment the record but granted a certificate of appeala-\nbility for the ineffective-assistance claim. Id. Dkt. 34, \nat 2. Rivers later asked the court either to stay his \nappeal or to remand so he could seek relief in the dis-\ntrict court without creating \u201cpiecemeal litigation.\u201d Id. \nDkt. 61, at 5\u20136. The Fifth Circuit refused, id. Dkt. 78, \nand ultimately affirmed, see Rivers v. Lumpkin, 2022 \n\n12 \n \n \nWL 1517027 (5th Cir. May 13, 2022), cert. denied, 143 \nS. Ct. 1090 (2023). \nb. In February 2021, while his appeal was still \npending, Rivers used the standard \u00a7 2254 petition \ntemplate provided to pro se litigants to bring the new \nevidence to the district court\u2019s attention. No. 7:21-cv-\n00012 (N.D. Tex.), Dkt. 2, at 7. While the filing also \nraised several new claims, Rivers chiefly argued that \ntrial counsel\u2019s \u201cfail[ure] to present exculpatory evi-\ndence\u201d violated his right to effective assistance. Id. \nDkt. 10, at 24. \nThe same magistrate judge who reviewed Rivers\u2019s \ninitial habeas petition recommended that the new fil-\ning be deemed a \u201csecond or successive\u201d petition and \ntransferred to the Fifth Circuit for lack of jurisdic-\ntion. See Pet. App. 3a\u20134a. Rivers objected to the rec-\nommendation, No. 7:21-cv-00012 (N.D. Tex.), Dkt. 27, \nand \u201cmove[d] the court to consider an interlocutory \nreview,\u201d id. Dkt. 26, at 5. The district court adopted \nthe recommendation and denied Rivers\u2019s motion as \nmoot. See Pet. App. 18a\u201319a \nRivers appealed the transfer order, urging the court \nto construe the February 2021 filing as an amend-\nment to his initial petition, instead of a second or suc-\ncessive petition. Pet. App. 3a\u20134a. The Fifth Circuit \naffirmed. Id. at 1a\u20132a. It reasoned that \u00a7 2244(b)(2) \napplies to \u201cfilings introduced after a final judgment \nthat raise habeas claims, no matter how titled.\u201d Id. at \n10a. Here, the February 2021 filing was \u201csecond-in-\ntime\u201d and \u201cattack[ed] the same conviction that [Riv-\ners had] challenged\u201d in his initial habeas proceeding, \nso it counted as \u201csecond or successive.\u201d Id. at 6a. The \ncourt\u2019s opinion acknowledged that eight other circuits \nhad splintered on the question. Id. at 8a. \n\n13 \n \n \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \nThe courts of appeals are intractably split over \nwhether \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies to a habeas filing made \nafter the district court has denied an initial petition \nbut before an appellate court has weighed in. That \nquestion is critically important to states and prison-\ners alike, and it arises too often to leave up to geo-\ngraphical happenstance. The decision below is also \nwrong. It ignores this Court\u2019s guidance in Banister, \nflies in the face of historical practice, and frustrates\u2014\nrather than furthers\u2014AEDPA\u2019s aims. Finally, this \ncase is an ideal vehicle for the Court to offer much-\nneeded guidance. The issue is cleanly presented and \noutcome-determinative: only the Fifth Circuit\u2019s mis-\ntaken reading of \u00a7 2244(b)(2) stands between Rivers \nand a meaningful path to relief. The Court should \ngrant the petition. \nI. The courts of appeals are split four ways \nover what triggers \u00a7 2244(b)(2), and only \nthis Court can resolve the conflict. \nNine circuits have split four ways over the question \npresented. In the Second Circuit, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) does \nnot apply until the petitioner exhausts appellate re-\nview of his first habeas petition. The Fifth, Sixth, \nSeventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits disa-\ngree, holding that \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies as soon as, or \nshortly after, the district court enters final judgment. \n(Even they can\u2019t agree on the precise trigger.) Mean-\nwhile, the Tenth Circuit applies \u00a7 2244(b)(2) even \nearlier\u2014except when the petitioner satisfies a seven-\nfactor test. And in the Third Circuit, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) tog-\ngles on and off depending on whether the petitioner \nwins or loses on appeal. Respondent acknowledged \nthe split below, see No. 21-11031 (5th Cir.), Dkt. 52, \nat 15\u201324, and only this Court can resolve it.  \n\n14 \n \n \nA. In the Second Circuit, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) does \nnot apply until appellate review of the \nfirst habeas petition is exhausted.  \nIn Whab v. United States, the Second Circuit held \nthat \u00a7 2244(b)(2) does not apply while \u201cappellate pro-\nceedings following the district court\u2019s dismissal of the \ninitial petition remain pending.\u201d 408 F.3d 116, 118 \n(2d Cir. 2005).  \nUsama Whab filed a pro se habeas petition. Id. at \n117. The district court denied the petition and de-\nclined to issue a certificate of appealability. Id. at \n118. Whab then sought a certificate of appealability \nfrom the Second Circuit, which the court ultimately \ndenied. Id. While that motion was still pending, how-\never, Whab asked the Second Circuit for permission \nto file a \u201csecond or successive\u201d petition. Id. at 119. \nThe court held that Whab\u2019s \u201csubsequent petition \nwas not \u2018second or successive\u2019 within the meaning of\u201d \nAEDPA. Id. at 118. Citing then-Judge Sotomayor\u2019s \nrationale in Ching v. United States, it explained that \na petition can\u2019t be \u201csecond or successive\u201d unless it is \nfiled after \u201cthe conclusion of a proceeding that counts \nas the first.\u201d 298 F.3d at 177. And the first proceeding \nisn\u2019t over until the \u201copportunity to seek review in the \nSupreme Court has expired.\u201d Whab, 408 F.3d at 120. \nBecause Whab\u2019s first proceeding was still pending \nwhen he filed his subsequent petition, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) \ndid not apply. Id. at 119.  \nOf course, that doesn\u2019t mean that anything goes. \n\u201cTraditional doctrines, such as abuse of the writ, con-\ntinue to apply.\u201d Id. at 119 n.2. So even if a filing is \nnot \u201csecond or successive\u201d under \u00a7 2244(b)(2), prison-\ners do not get a \u201cfree pass\u201d to \u201cfile numerous petitions \nbefore an initially filed petition is finally adjudicated \n\n15 \n \n \non the merits.\u201d Id.; see also Ching, 298 F.3d at 179\u2013\n80 (\u201cCourts are not obliged to entertain needless or \npiecemeal litigation; nor should they adjudicate a mo-\ntion or petition whose purpose is to vex, harass, or \ndelay.\u201d) Neither can prisoners \u201cprevent the adjudica-\ntion of an initial habeas petition from ever becoming \nfinal by extending the first habeas proceedings \nthrough an infinite number of new petitions.\u201d Fuller \nv. United States, 815 F.3d 112, 113 (2d Cir. 2016). \nSection 2244(b)(2) kicks in \u201cwhen the time to file a \npetition for certiorari \u2026 expire[s]\u201d\u2014whether or not a \nfollow-up petition is still pending. Id. \nSince Whab, the Second Circuit has repeatedly re-\naffirmed this workable approach. E.g., Garcia v. Su-\nperintendent of Great Meadow Corr. Facility, 841 \nF.3d 581, 582 (2d Cir. 2016); Fuller, 815 F.3d at 113.  \nB. In the Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, \nNinth, and Eleventh Circuits, \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies when the district \ncourt enters final judgment or  \nshortly after. \nSix circuits have expressly rejected the Second Cir-\ncuit\u2019s approach, holding that \u00a7 2244(b)(2) is triggered \nat (or around) the time that the district court enters \nfinal judgment. Yet even these courts can\u2019t agree on \nexactly what triggers the statute. \n1. In the Fifth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Elev-\nenth Circuits, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies as soon as the dis-\ntrict court enters final judgment. \na. The Fifth Circuit below recognized the split and \n\u201cdecline[d] \u2026 to embrace\u201d the Second Circuit\u2019s rule, \nholding instead that \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies after the en-\ntry of final judgment. Pet. App. 10a\u201312a. \n\n16 \n \n \nThe district court denied Danny Rivers\u2019s pro se ha-\nbeas petition and entered final judgment. Pet. \nApp. 2a. The Fifth Circuit then granted a certificate \nof appealability as to Rivers\u2019s ineffective-assistance \nclaim. Id. While that appeal was pending, Rivers \nsought further relief in the district court. Applying \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2), the district court deemed Rivers\u2019s filing \na \u201csecond or successive\u201d petition, and the Fifth Cir-\ncuit affirmed. \nAccording to the Fifth Circuit, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) covers \n\u201cfilings introduced after a final judgment that raise \nhabeas claims.\u201d Pet. App. 10a. The court derived that \nrule from this Court\u2019s decision in Gonzalez v. Crosby, \n545 U.S. 524 (2005). The prisoner in Gonzalez \u201cdid \nnot file for rehearing or review\u201d in his first habeas \nproceeding and then sought Rule 60(b) relief a year \nlater. Id. at 527. This Court held that \u00a7 2244(b)(2) did \nnot apply because the prisoner\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion \ndid not raise habeas claims. The Fifth Circuit read \nGonzalez to stand for the \u201cunderlying principle\u201d that \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies after final judgment, lest prison-\ners use \u201cpost-judgment motions\u201d to evade AEDPA. \nBut see Balbuena, 970 F.3d at 1200 (Fletcher, J., con-\ncurring in the result) (\u201cGonzalez does not answer the \nquestion whether [a petition] is a \u2018second or succes-\nsive\u2019 habeas application under \u00a7 2244(b).\u201d). \nb. The Ninth Circuit also applies \u00a7 2244(b)(2) as \nsoon as the district court has \u201cadjudicated [a] habeas \npetition on the merits.\u201d Balbuena v. Sullivan, 980 \nF.3d 619, 642 (9th Cir. 2020).  \nWhile the denial of Alexander Balbuena\u2019s habeas \npetition was still pending on appeal, Balbuena sought \nadditional relief in the district court. Id. at 628, 639. \nThe district court deemed Balbuena\u2019s subsequent fil-\ning \u201can unauthorized second or successive petition,\u201d \n\n17 \n \n \nand the Ninth Circuit affirmed. Id. at 628. Citing cir-\ncuit precedent, it held that \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applied be-\ncause Balbuena \u201csought to add a new claim after the \ndistrict court denied his petition.\u201d Id. at 636\u201337. \nAlong the way, the Ninth Circuit expressly acknowl-\nedged\u2014and \u201cdecline[d] to follow\u201d\u2014the Second Cir-\ncuit\u2019s contrary approach. Id. at 637. \nJudge Fletcher wrote separately to \u201curge the Su-\npreme Court to recognize the circuit split and adopt\u201d \nthe Second Circuit\u2019s rule. Id. at 642 (Fletcher, J., con-\ncurring in the result). In his view, the Ninth Circuit \n\u201cmade a mistake\u201d both \u201cas a matter of ordinary lan-\nguage\u201d and \u201cas a practical matter.\u201d Id. at 644. As to \ntext, he reasoned that \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies \u201conly once \nan appeal has been finally adjudicated.\u201d Id. And as to \nconsequences, he explained that the Second Circuit\u2019s \nrule \u201cwill not result in a flood of late and procedurally \nabusive claims.\u201d Id. He closed by \u201cencourag[ing]\u201d this \nCourt to \u201cresolve the conflict in the circuits\u201d and ex-\npressing \u201coptimis[m]\u201d that it would \u201cagree with\u201d the \nSecond Circuit \u201crather than\u201d the Ninth. Id. at 645. \nc. The Seventh Circuit also holds that final judg-\nment triggers \u00a7 2244(b)(2). See Phillips v. United \nStates, 668 F.3d 433, 435\u201336 (7th Cir. 2012). While \nthe Seventh Circuit was reviewing his habeas denial, \nDavid Phillips asked the district court to consider \nnewly discovered evidence. Id. at 434. The district \ncourt denied that motion on the merits, but the Sev-\nenth Circuit approached things differently. It held \nthat the new filing was not \u201cproperly before the dis-\ntrict court\u201d in the first place because it was a second-\nor-successive petition. Id. That was so (reasoned the \ncourt) because \u201c[f]inal judgment marks a terminal \npoint,\u201d and \u201c[t]reating motions filed during appeal as \n\n18 \n \n \npart of the original application\u201d would undermine \nAEDPA\u2019s \u201ctime-and-number limits.\u201d Id. at 435. \nd. The Eighth Circuit follows a similar approach. \nSee Williams v. Norris, 461 F.3d 999 (8th Cir. 2006). \nAfter the district court denied Frank Williams\u2019s ha-\nbeas petition, it failed to enter a separate final judg-\nment. Id. at 1000\u201301. In the brief period before the \norder became final, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 58, Williams \nmoved to amend the judgment and sought relief from \nit. 461 F.3d at 1000\u201301. The district court denied \nboth motions as second-or-successive habeas peti-\ntions. Id. The Eighth Circuit affirmed, reasoning that \nthe district court had intended to \u201cdispose of Wil-\nliams\u2019s petition on the merits,\u201d so his later filings \nwere \n\u201cpostjudgment\u201d\u2014and \nthus \nsubject \nto \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2). Id. at 1002. \ne. The Eleventh Circuit also applies \u00a7 2244(b)(2) af-\nter final judgment. See United States v. Terrell, 141 \nF. App\u2019x 849, 851\u201352 (11th Cir. 2005). Shortly after \nGeorge Terrell asked the Eleventh Circuit to review \nthe denial of his initial habeas petition, he sought ad-\nditional habeas relief in the district court. Id. at 850\u2013\n51. The district court applied \u00a7 2244(b)(2), deeming \nhis motion an unauthorized second-or-successive ap-\nplication. Id. at 851. The Eleventh Circuit agreed, \nemphasizing that \u201cthe district court had already de-\nnied\u201d Terrell\u2019s initial habeas petition. Id. at 852.  \n2. The Sixth Circuit follows a slightly different rule, \ntying \u00a7 2244(b)(2) to the opportunity for appeal\u2014not \nthe entry of final judgment. \nSamuel Moreland\u2019s initial habeas petition was still \npending on appeal when Moreland sought further \nhabeas relief in the district court. Moreland v. Robin-\nson, 813 F.3d 315, 322 (6th Cir. 2016). The Sixth Cir-\n\n19 \n \n \ncuit deemed Moreland\u2019s filings \u201csecond or successive \nhabeas petitions.\u201d Id. at 319. But instead of pegging \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2) to the entry of final judgment, like the \nFifth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits, \nthe Sixth Circuit focused on the window for appeal. \nIn its view, a motion that \u201cseeks to raise habeas \nclaims\u201d is a \u201csecond or successive habeas petition\u201d \nwhen filed \u201cafter the petitioner has appealed the dis-\ntrict court\u2019s denial of his original habeas petition or \nafter the time for the petitioner to do so has expired.\u201d \nId. at 325. In other words, courts in the Sixth Circuit \nask whether \u201cthe district court has \u2026 lost jurisdiction \nof the original habeas petition.\u201d Jones v. Bradshaw, \n46 F.4th 459, 479\u201381 (6th Cir. 2022). This means that \na petitioner who would be out of luck in the other cir-\ncuits could get relief in the Sixth Circuit while the \nwindow to appeal is still open. \nC. In the Tenth Circuit, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies \nafter a first-in-time petition is filed, un-\nless the petitioner satisfies a seven-\nfactor test.  \nThe Tenth Circuit applies \u00a7 2244(b)(2) whenever a \nsecond-in-time petition raises \u201cseparate and distinct\u201d \nclaims\u2014even if the first-in-time petition is still pend-\ning before the district court. United States v. Espino-\nza-Saenz, 235 F.3d 501, 503, 505 (10th Cir. 2000). \nThat rule puts the Tenth Circuit at odds with not on-\nly the Second Circuit, see Ochoa v. Sirmons, 485 F.3d \n538, 540\u201341 (10th Cir. 2007) (\u201cdeclin[ing]\u201d to follow \nthe Second Circuit\u2019s rule), but also with other circuits \nthat allow amendments before final judgment, e.g., \nPhillips, 668 F.3d at 435.  \nBut petitioners in the Tenth Circuit can avoid this \notherwise strict rule when \u201cjustice\u201d demands. Doug-\nlas v. Workman, 560 F.3d 1156, 1190 (10th Cir. 2009). \n\n20 \n \n \nWhile the denial of his first habeas petition was \npending on appeal, Yancy Douglas asked the Tenth \nCircuit for permission to file a second application as-\nserting that prosecutors had concealed information \nabout a key witness. Id. at 1160, 1167\u201368. The Tenth \nCircuit acknowledged that, under Ochoa, it \u201cwould \nnot ordinarily permit a habeas petitioner to supple-\nment his habeas petition in this way.\u201d Id. at 1189. \nBut this was no ordinary case. Rather, based on \u201csev-\nen factors\u201d\u2014including that Douglas\u2019s initial habeas \npetition remained pending, that the new claim relat-\ned closely to his pending claims, the prosecutor\u2019s con-\nduct, that Douglas faced the death penalty, and dis-\nparity between Douglas and his codefendant\u2014the \ncourt decided to \u201cdeem\u201d the later petition \u201ca supple-\nment to the previously asserted\u201d petition, rather than \na second-or-successive petition. Id. at 1189\u201396. The \nupshot is that courts in the Tenth Circuit don\u2019t apply \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2) under circumstances when courts in the \nFifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Eleventh \nCircuits would have to. See also United States v. \nPickard, 396 F. App\u2019x 568, 572 (10th Cir. 2010). \nD. In the Third Circuit, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) toggles \non and off depending on who wins the \ninitial appeal.  \nFinally, the Third Circuit follows its own unique \nrule. It agrees with the Second Circuit that \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2) does not automatically apply to a \u201csubse-\nquent habeas petition\u201d filed before \u201cexhaustion of ap-\npellate remedies with respect to the denial of [the] \ninitial habeas petition.\u201d Santarelli, 929 F.3d at 104\u2013\n05. But prisoners in Delaware, New Jersey, and \nPennsylvania face a twist that those in Connecticut, \nNew York, and Vermont don\u2019t. When a prisoner in \nthe Third Circuit seeks further habeas relief while \n\n21 \n \n \nhis initial petition is pending on appeal, the applica-\nbility of \u00a7 2244(b)(2) depends on the outcome of that \nappeal. See id. at 104 n.5 (Even if a \u201csubsequent ha-\nbeas petition\u201d is \u201cnot \u2018second or successive\u2019 at the time \nof filing,\u201d it \u201ccould later be construed as a \u2018second or \nsuccessive\u2019 habeas petition.\u201d). \nHere\u2019s the Third Circuit\u2019s logic. While the first peti-\ntion is up on appeal, the petitioner has not had \u201cone \nfull opportunity to seek collateral review.\u201d Id. at 105 \n(citation omitted). So a subsequent petition filed dur-\ning that period should be \u201cconstrued as a motion to \namend\u201d the first petition. Id. at 105\u201306. That motion \nbelongs \u201cin the district court in the first instance.\u201d Id. \nat 106. Yet the district court lacks jurisdiction while \nthe appeal is pending, so the motion to amend must \nstay on ice. Id. Now for the twist. If the Third Circuit \n\u201cvacates or reverses \u2026 and remands the matter,\u201d the \ndistrict court \u201cwould again be vested with jurisdiction \nto consider\u201d the motion. Id. When that happens, \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2) doesn\u2019t apply. On the other hand, if the \nprisoner \u201cexhausts her appellate remedies to no \navail,\u201d she has \u201cexpended the \u2018one full opportunity to \nseek collateral review\u2019 that AEDPA ensures.\u201d Id. (ci-\ntation omitted). In that case, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) does apply \nand\u2014presto!\u2014the \u201cmotion to amend\u201d becomes a \u201csec-\nond or successive\u201d habeas petition. Id. \n*     *     * \nOnly this Court can \u201cresolve the conflict in the cir-\ncuits,\u201d Balbuena, 980 F.3d at 642 (Fletcher, J., con-\ncurring in the result), and there is no reason to wait. \nThree circuits have already denied rehearing en \nbanc\u2014and one of them has done so twice. See Order, \nPhillips v. United States, Nos. 10-2154 & 11-1498 \n(7th Cir. Feb. 21, 2012); Order, Williams v. Norris, \nNo. 04-3485 (8th Cir. Jan. 11, 2007); Order, Balbuena \n\n22 \n \n \nv. Sullivan, Nos. 12-16414, 18-15432 (9th Cir. Nov. \n17, 2020); Order, Jacobs v. Thornell, No. 22-16822 \n(9th Cir. Apr. 9, 2024). The others show no sign of re-\nthinking their positions. Nor is there any need for \nmore percolation. The nine circuits that have already \nweighed in cover roughly 88% of all federal and state \nprisoners. See Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Statistics, \nbit.ly/Federal-Prisons; Prison Pol\u2019y Initiative, Appen-\ndix: State and Federal Prison Populations 2019-2023, \nbit.ly/State-Prisons. All positions are staked out, and \nthis Court now has the benefit of numerous opinions \non the issue. The Court should grant review. \nII. The question presented is critically im-\nportant and recurring. \nA. The question presented is too important to punt. \nSince 1996, AEDPA cases have become a fixture of \nthis Court\u2019s docket. In fact, the Court has repeatedly \ngranted cert to resolve conflicts over this very provi-\nsion. See, e.g., Banister, 590 U.S. at 511 (5-3 split); \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. 524 (2005); Slack v. McDaniel, \n529 U.S. 473 (2000) (3-4 split); Stewart v. Martinez-\nVillareal, 523 U.S. 637, 641 (1998) (1-1 split). That \nalone suggests certworthiness\u2014even apart from the \nfact that this split is deeper than those. \nThe issue is also critically important to parties on \nboth sides. Until this Court weighs in, at least some \nstates and prisoners will be living under the wrong \nrule, and those in the outstanding circuits will have \nto guess which rule applies. For states, that uncer-\ntainty turns AEDPA\u2019s promise of \u201cfinality\u201d on its \nhead. Banister, 590 U.S. at 512. But the stakes are \neven higher for prisoners. Cf. Boumediene v. Bush, \n553 U.S. 723, 739 (2008) (calling habeas \u201cone of the \nfew safeguards of liberty specified in a Constitution \nthat, at the outset, had no Bill of Rights\u201d). \u201cFederal \n\n23 \n \n \npostconviction law is complex, and few prisoners un-\nderstand it well.\u201d Curry v. United States, 507 F.3d \n603, 604 (7th Cir. 2007). So the last thing they need \nwhen seeking to navigate AEDPA\u2019s procedural thick-\net is uncertainty over which thicket they are in. \nB. The need for review is all the more pressing be-\ncause this issue arises so often. Two circuits have \nconfronted the question presented in the last four \nmonths. See Pet. App. 1a; Jacobs v. Thornell, 2024 \nWL 810443 (9th Cir. Feb. 27, 2024). But that\u2019s noth-\ning compared to the district courts. See, e.g., Daly v. \nOliver, 2024 WL 2092997, at *3 (E.D. Pa. May 9, \n2024), appeal docketed, No. 24-2070 (3d Cir. June 18, \n2024); Herrera v. United States, 2024 WL 218964, at \n*1 (N.D. Tex. Jan. 19, 2024); Hernandez v. Macomber, \n2023 WL 2992172, at *3 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 17, 2023); \nThomas v. Sec\u2019y, Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., 2023 WL \n2837521, at *9\u201311 (M.D. Fla. Apr. 7, 2023); Bollinger \nv. Gittere, 2023 WL 2242444, at *1\u20133 (D. Nev. Feb. \n24, 2023), appeal docketed, No. 23-99002 (9th Cir. \nMarch. 28, 2023); Perpall v. United States, 2023 WL \n2016836, at *1\u20132 (S.D. Fla. Feb. 15, 2023) (acknowl-\nedging the split); Atkins v. United States, 2023 WL \n1765536, at *3 (S.D. Fla. Feb. 3, 2023) (same).  \nAnd those are just (some of) the cases available on \nWestlaw. The federal courts received over 14,000 ha-\nbeas petitions last year. See U.S. Courts, Civil Statis-\ntical Tables For the Federal Judiciary (Dec. 31, 2023), \nbit.ly/2023-Statistics. Since one in ten habeas cases \ninvolves an amended petition, see N. King, et al., Fi-\nnal Technical Report: Habeas Litigation in U.S. Dis-\ntrict Courts 34 (2007), bit.ly/Habeas-Report, the real \nnumbers are likely far higher. Cf. Rachel Brown, et \nal., Is Unpublished Unequal? An Empirical Examina-\ntion of the 87% Nonpublication Rate in Federal Ap-\n\n24 \n \n \npeals, 107 Cornell L. Rev. 1, 62 (2021) (finding that \npro se, non-capital habeas cases are \u201cpublished at less \nthan one-third of the overall rate\u201d). \nIII. The decision below is wrong. \nThe Fifth Circuit thought that \u00a7 2244(b)(2) required \nthe district court to dismiss \u201cfor lack of jurisdiction\u201d \nbecause Rivers\u2019s 2021 filing was \u201cintroduced after a \nfinal judgment\u201d and \u201craise[d] habeas claims.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 10a\u201311a. That is wrong. Banister showed how \ncourts should determine \u201cwhat qualifies as second or \nsuccessive,\u201d 590 U.S. at 512, and its logic favors Riv-\ners here. But the Fifth Circuit didn\u2019t even cite Banis-\nter\u2014let alone engage in the proper analysis\u2014and its \nrule doesn\u2019t square with this Court\u2019s holdings either.    \nA. Section 2244(b)(2) does not apply until \nappellate review of the first habeas ap-\nplication is exhausted. \nThe phrase \u201csecond or successive application\u201d is a \n\u201cterm of art\u201d that is \u201cnot self-defining.\u201d Banister, 590 \nU.S. at 511 (quoting Slack, 529 U.S. at 486). To de-\ntermine when \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies, \u201cthis Court has \nlooked for guidance in two main places.\u201d Id. at 512. \nFirst, history: \u201cwhether a type of later-in-time filing \nwould have constituted an abuse of the writ, as that \nconcept is explained\u201d in this Court\u2019s \u201cpre-AEDPA cas-\nes.\u201d Id. (cleaned up) (quoting Panetti, 551 U.S. at \n947). Second, \u201cAEDPA\u2019s own purposes\u201d: conserving \njudicial resources, reducing piecemeal litigation, and \nachieving finality \u201cwithin a reasonable time.\u201d Id. (cit-\ning Panetti, 551 U.S. at 945\u201346). Here, both factors \nalign. Early courts applied abuse-of-the-writ rules in \nlight of appellate review, not final judgment, and ap-\nplying \u00a7 2244(b)(2) to filings like Rivers\u2019s would frus-\ntrate, not further, AEDPA\u2019s aims. \n\n25 \n \n \n1. Courts historically analyzed abuses of \nthe writ by reference to appellate re-\nview, not final judgment. \nThe abuse-of-the-writ doctrine was a nineteenth-\ncentury innovation. \u201c[B]y the common law of Eng-\nland, as it stood at the adoption of the constitution,\u201d \nthe denial of habeas relief was \u201cno bar to the issuing \nof a second or third or more writs, by any other court \nor magistrate having jurisdiction of the case.\u201d Ex \nparte Kaine, 14 F. Cas. 78, 80 (C.C.S.D.N.Y. 1853). \nInstead, \u201ccourts and judges were accustomed to exer-\ncise an independent judgment on each successive ap-\nplication, regardless of the number.\u201d Salinger v. \nLoisel, 265 U.S. 224, 231 (1924). Only later, once \u201ca \nright to an appellate review was given,\u201d did American \ncourts pare back this practice. Id. When they did, \nthey tied abuse-of-the-writ rules to the completion of \nappellate review\u2014not the entry of final judgment.  \nEx parte Cuddy, one of the earliest abuse-of-the-\nwrit cases, is a good example. 40 F. 62, 66 (C.C.S.D. \nCal. 1889) (Field, J.). A district court denied Thomas \nCuddy\u2019s habeas petition, and this Court affirmed. Id. \nat 63 (citing Ex parte Cuddy, 131 U.S. 280 (1889)). \nCuddy then sought habeas relief from Justice Field, \nriding circuit. Justice Field ordered the writ dis-\nmissed, reasoning that \u201ca second application upon the \nsame facts \u2026 should not be heard,\u201d absent \u201cleave to \nmake a new application.\u201d Id. at 66.  \nAlong the way, Justice Field emphasized two \nthings. First, \u201caction \u2026 on the second application\u201d \nshould turn on the \u201ccharacter of the court or officer to \nwhom the first application was made, and the full-\nness of the consideration given to it.\u201d Id. In Cuddy, \nfor example, Justice Field rejected the petition be-\ncause the prisoner sought further relief \u201cafter invok-\n\n26 \n \n \ning the judgment of the appellate court\u201d and \u201cfailing \ntherein.\u201d Id. at 64. In other words: the abuse-of-the-\nwrit doctrine applied after this Court weighed in\u2014\nnot after the district court entered final judgment. In \nfact, had the prisoner not \u201cappealed from the refusal \nof the district court,\u201d he could have \u201capplied to the \ncircuit judge\u201d for the same relief. Id. at 66. Second, \nJustice Field \u201crefer[red], of course,\u201d only to \u201ccases \nwhere a second application is made upon the same \nfacts presented, or which might have been presented\u201d \nin the initial application. Id. In his view, things \nwould be \u201centirely different\u201d if \u201csubsequent occurring \nevents\u201d offered \u201cnew\u201d grounds for consideration. Id. \nThis Court\u2019s abuse-of-the-writ cases followed the \nsame approach. Take Salinger, 265 U.S. at 230\u201332, \nwhich involved a serial habeas petitioner. Citing \nCuddy, the Court explained that an appellate court\u2019s \n\u201cprior refusal\u201d to grant a \u201clike application\u201d carries \nweight \u201cwhen a later application is being considered.\u201d \nId. at 230\u201331. Since the \u201cprior refusal\u201d in Salinger \nwas \u201caffirmed in a considered opinion by a Circuit \nCourt of Appeals,\u201d with \u201cno attempt to obtain\u201d further \nreview, an abuse-of-the-writ dismissal \u201cwould have \nbeen well exercised.\u201d Id. at 226\u201327, 232. Here again, \nwhat mattered was that an appellate court had \nweighed in\u2014not that a district court had denied the \nfirst petition and entered final judgment. \nAll of that boils down to this. When early courts \napplied abuse-of-the-writ rules, they asked whether \nan appellate decisionmaker had spoken\u2014not whether \na district court had entered final judgment. That \nmakes sense, since this Court has long understood \n\u201cproceedings in the appellate tribunal\u201d to be part of \nthe \u201cprocess of law\u201d by which prisoners test the legal-\nity of confinement. Frank v. Mangum, 237 U.S. 309, \n\n27 \n \n \n327 (1915) (discussing appellate review of conviction). \nAgainst that backdrop, a rule that treats final judg-\nment as the relevant inflection point is \u201cbad wine of \nrecent vintage.\u201d Rotkiske v. Klemm, 589 U.S. 8, 14 \n(2019) (citing TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U.S. 19, 37 \n(2001) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment)). \n2. Treating filings like Rivers\u2019s as \u201csec-\nond or successive\u201d would frustrate \nAEDPA\u2019s aims. \nBanister\u2019s other source of guidance\u2014\u201cAEDPA\u2019s own \npurposes\u201d\u2014points the same way. 590 U.S. at 512. \nTreating filings like Rivers\u2019s as \u201csecond or successive\u201d \nwould have baleful \u201cimplications for habeas practice,\u201d \nmaking it unlikely that \u201cCongress would have viewed \n[them] as successive.\u201d Id. at 512\u201313. \na. Judicial resources. So far as the lower courts \nare concerned, the question is not whether prisoners \nlike Rivers will seek further relief while their initial \npetitions are on appeal. The question instead is which \ncourt will review those filings first. Everyone agrees \nthat \u201ca three-judge panel of the court of appeals\u201d is \nthe first port of call for petitions filed after a prisoner \nexhausts appellate review of his initial application. \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(B). But Congress had little \nreason to channel filings like Rivers\u2019s down that \npath\u2014and good reason to treat them as part and par-\ncel of the initial habeas application. \ni. If section 2244(b)(2) is a \u201crock[y]\u201d path for prison-\ners, that goes double for courts. Banister, 590 U.S. at \n509. When the court of appeals receives a \u201csecond or \nsuccessive\u201d petition, three appellate judges have to \ndecide\u2014from square zero, and often without adver-\nsarial briefing\u2014whether the new evidence could have \nbeen \u201cdiscovered previously through the exercise of \n\n28 \n \n \ndue diligence.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(B)(i). Then they \nhave to examine \u201cthe evidence as a whole\u201d and de-\ntermine whether \u201cthe facts underlying the claim, if \nproven,\u201d would be \u201csufficient to establish by clear and \nconvincing evidence\u201d that \u201cno reasonable factfinder\u201d \nwould have convicted but for constitutional error. Id. \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2)(B)(ii). That, in turn, means considering \nthe state\u2019s \u201ctheory of the case,\u201d the evidence \u201csup-\nport[ing]\u201d that theory, and the counterfactual effect of \nthe \u201cnewly-discovered evidence,\u201d including how it \nwould have undermined the state\u2019s evidence and in-\nfluenced the theories\u2014and even \u201calternative theo-\nries\u201d\u2014that both sides could have \u201coffered the jury.\u201d \nMunchinski v. Wilson, 694 F.3d 308, 335\u201337 (3d Cir. \n2012). One recent authorization case was pending be-\nfore the Fifth Circuit for almost three years, and the \nopinion features a two-column, sixteen-row chart that \nspans three pages of the Federal Reporter. See In re \nWill, 970 F.3d 536, 544\u201346 (5th Cir. 2020). And that\u2019s \njust the first step. Even when the appellate court au-\nthorizes a \u201csecond or successive\u201d petition, the district \ncourt must still \u201cconduct its own thorough review\u201d to \nensure \u201cthe requirements of \u00a7 2244(b)(2) have been \nsatisfied.\u201d Id. at 543 (citation and quotation marks \nomitted). Still more: because any claim \u201cpresented in \na prior application\u201d must be dismissed, \u00a7 2244(b)(1), \nboth courts must carefully compare the \u201csecond or \nsuccessive\u201d petition to all prior petitions and deter-\nmine precisely what \u201cclaim[s]\u201d have been brought. Id. \nat 541. That can be especially challenging when the \ncourts confront an \u201cinartistically drawn [pro se] peti-\ntion,\u201d Price v. Johnston, 334 U.S. 266, 292 (1948).  \nii. Now consider the alternative. When Rivers \nsought further relief in February 2021, he went be-\nfore the same magistrate judge and district court \njudge who denied his initial petition. Had those judg-\n\n29 \n \n \nes reached the merits, they\u2014better than anyone\u2014\nwould have known whether his new evidence was \nworth the candle. If not: game over. If so, the court \ncould have issued an indicative ruling under Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 62.1. E.g., Parry v. Kerestes, \n2013 WL 6002358 (W.D. Pa. Nov. 12, 2013). Either \nway, a judge \u201cfamiliar with a habeas applicant\u2019s \nclaims\u201d would likely make \u201cquick work\u201d of a filing like \nthis. Banister, 590 U.S. at 517. That\u2019s good reason to \nthink that a Congress concerned about judicial re-\nsources \u201cwould have viewed\u201d such filings as \u201cpart and \nparcel of the first habeas proceeding.\u201d Id. at 507, 513.  \nb. Reducing piecemeal litigation. The latter \npath would serve AEDPA\u2019s second aim too\u2014and this \ncase is Exhibit A. New evidence in hand, Rivers \nasked the Fifth Circuit to remand so that he could \nseek relief on \u201call [his] claims rather than revisiting \nthis case in piecemeal litigation.\u201d No. 18-11490 (5th \nCir.) Dkt. 61, at 5\u20136. When that failed, he asked the \ndistrict court to \u201cconsider an interlocutory review\u201d to \n\u201cprevent unnecessary litigation and to preserve judi-\ncial resources.\u201d No. 7:21-cv-00012 (N.D. Tex.), Dkt. \n26, at 5. Instead, the court transferred the matter to \nthe Fifth Circuit, which opened a brand new proceed-\ning, where Rivers must convince three judges to au-\nthorize a fourth judge to consider whether or not to \nconsider the new evidence. \nc. Finality. Finality cuts the same way. Suppose \nthat the state investigator\u2019s report that Rivers dis-\ncovered in his client file isn\u2019t the bombshell that Riv-\ners reckons. In that case, the way to \u201clend[] finality\u201d \nto Rivers\u2019s conviction \u201cwithin a reasonable time\u201d \nwould have been for the district court to say so in \nSeptember 2021. Banister, 590 U.S. at 512. Had it \ndone that, this case would be over. Instead, the lower \n\n30 \n \n \ncourts sent Rivers and Texas down a path that could \nprolong this case\u2014and leave the validity of Rivers\u2019s \nconviction up in the air\u2014for years to come. \n* \n* \n* \nHad Congress wanted all post-judgment habeas fil-\nings to count as second or successive petitions, \u201cit eas-\nily could have written\u201d such a law. Ali v. Fed. Bureau \nof Prisons, 552 U.S. 214, 227 (2008). But it\u2019s hard to \nsqueeze that rule from the text of \u00a7 2244(b)(2) and the \nhistory against which it was written. And it\u2019s even \nharder to attribute the consequences to a Congress \nfocused on judicial resources, efficiency, and finality. \nSee N.Y. State Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs. v. Dublino, 413 \nU.S. 405, 419\u201320 (1973) (\u201cWe cannot interpret federal \nstatute to negate their own stated purposes.\u201d).  \nB. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision cannot be \nsquared with this Court\u2019s cases. \nThe Fifth Circuit addressed none of this. It did not \nask whether Rivers\u2019s filing \u201cwould have constituted \nan abuse of the writ, as that concept is explained in \n[this Court\u2019s] pre-AEDPA cases.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. \nat 512 (cleaned up) (quoting Panetti, 551 U.S. at 947). \nIt did not explain how its approach would \u201cconserv[e] \njudicial resources\u201d or \u201cstreamlin[e] habeas cases.\u201d Id. \nat 515, 517. And while it offered vague generalities \nabout evading AEDPA\u2019s limitations, it said not a \nword about finality, let alone whether its rule would \nhasten or hinder that objective here. In fact, the court \ndidn\u2019t even cite Banister\u2014even through both parties \nrelied on that case in their briefs. \nNor does the Fifth Circuit\u2019s approach square with \nthis Court\u2019s holdings. Gregory Banister\u2019s Rule 59(e) \nmotion came \u201cafter a final judgment\u201d and raised \u201cha-\nbeas claims,\u201d Pet. App. 10a, but this Court still held \n\n31 \n \n \nthat it was \u201cpart and parcel of the first habeas pro-\nceeding,\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 507. Likewise, the \nprisoner in Slack filed a post-final-judgment habeas \npetition, and this Court allowed that to proceed too. \nSlack, 529 U.S. at 487. And the same was true in \nStewart, where the prisoner\u2019s post-final-judgment \nhabeas application \u201cwas not a \u2018second or successive\u2019 \npetition\u2019 under \u00a7 2244(b).\u201d 523 U.S. at 643\u201345. \nIV. This case is an excellent vehicle. \nThis case is an ideal vehicle to finish what Banister \nstarted. The question presented raises a pure legal \nissue that was fully briefed and squarely decided be-\nlow. There are no preservation problems, alternative \nholdings, or factual disputes that would frustrate re-\nview. And the split is outcome-determinative. The \nFifth Circuit declined to consider Rivers\u2019s new evi-\ndence because it thought \u00a7 2244(b)(2) required that \nresult. Yet if Rivers were held in Buffalo, New York, \ninstead of Beeville, Texas, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) would have \nbeen no barrier, and the lower courts could have \nreached the merits. In other words, if this Court re-\nverses and adopts the Second Circuit\u2019s rule, Rivers \nwill have a meaningful path to relief. The lower \ncourts denied Rivers\u2019s initial petition largely because \nhe could not pinpoint what his counsel should have \ndone differently or how that might have changed \nthings. See Rivers, 2018 WL 4443153, at *4. But the \nnew evidence puts those questions to rest. Now all \nthat stands between Rivers and a fighting chance is \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s mistaken reading of \u00a7 2244(b)(2).  \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should grant the petition. \n \n\n32 \n \n \nRespectfully submitted,  \n \n \nPeter A.

The second petition, dubbed by Rivers as an \nattempt to amend his initial petition, reiterated an \nineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim from his first \npetition as well as raised new habeas claims, again \nchallenging his underlying state convictions.

The court below\u2014and the majority of \nthe circuits\u2014have issued decisions fully consistent \nwith this Court\u2019s precedents and with AEDPA\u2019s clear \npurposes. The circuit majority rule minimizes the \nwaste of judicial resources, restricts piecemeal \nlitigation, and promotes the finality of criminal \nconvictions. \nThe \nremaining \ncircuits\u2014a \nsmall \nminority\u2014should self-correct, especially under the \nguidance of this Court\u2019s more recent decision in \nBanister v. Davis, 590 U.S. 504 (2020). Accordingly, \nRivers should be denied certiorari review. \n \nOPINIONS BELOW \n \nThe opinion of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals is \nreported at Rivers v. Lumpkin, 99 F.4th 216 (5th Cir. \n2024). Pet. App. 1a\u201311a. The district court\u2019s order \nadopting the magistrate judge\u2019s findings, conclusions, \nand \nrecommendation \n(Pet. \nApp. \n12a\u201317a), \nis \nunreported. Pet. App. 18a\u201319a. \n \n \nJURISDICTION \n \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment was entered on April \n15, 2024. Pet. App. 1a. This Court has jurisdiction \nunder the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1254(1) and \n2253(c). \n \nSTATUTORY PROVISION INVOLVED \n \nThe Question Presented involves the application of \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(a)\u2013(b): \n \n(a) No circuit or district judge shall be \n\n \n2 \n \nrequired to entertain an application for a \nwrit of habeas corpus to inquire into the \ndetention of a person pursuant to a \njudgment of a court of the United States \nif it appears that the legality of such \ndetention has been determined by a judge \nor court of the United States on a prior \napplication for a writ of habeas corpus, \nexcept as provided in section 2255. \n \n(b)(1) A claim presented in a second or \nsuccessive habeas corpus application \nunder section 2254 that was presented in \na prior application shall be dismissed. \n \n     (2) A claim presented in a second or \nsuccessive habeas corpus application \nunder \nsection \n2254 \nthat \nwas \nnot \npresented in a prior application shall be \ndismissed unless\u2014 \n(A) the applicant shows that the \nclaim relies on a new rule of \nconstitutional \nlaw, \nmade \nretroactive to cases on collateral \nreview by the Supreme Court, that \nwas previously unavailable; or \n(B)(i) the factual predicate for the \nclaim \ncould \nnot \nhave \nbeen \ndiscovered previously through the \nexercise of due diligence; and \n     (ii) the facts underlying the \nclaim, if proven and viewed in light \nof the evidence as a whole, would \nbe sufficient to establish by clear \nand convincing evidence that, but \n\n \n3 \n \nfor \nconstitutional \nerror, \nno \nreasonable factfinder would have \nfound the applicant guilty of the \nunderlying offense. \n \n    (3)(A) Before a second or successive \napplication permitted by this section is \nfiled in the district court, the applicant \nshall move in the appropriate court of \nappeals for an order authorizing the \ndistrict court to consider the application. \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE  \n \nA Texas jury found Rivers guilty of one count of \ncontinuous sexual abuse of a young child (Count I), two \ncounts of indecency with a child by contact (Counts II \nand III), one count of indecency with a child by \nexposure (Count IV), and two counts of possession of \nchild pornography (Counts V and VI). Rivers v. State, \nNo. 08-12-00145-CR, 2014 WL 3662569 (Tex. App.\u2014El \nPaso Jul. 23, 2014, pet. ref\u2019d). Rivers received \nsentences of thirty years\u2019 incarceration for Count I, \nthree years\u2019 incarceration each for Counts II and III, \nand two years\u2019 incarceration for Count IV, all to run \nconsecutively. Id.  He received two concurrent two-year \nsentences for Counts V and VI. Id. \n \n \nAfter exhausting his available state remedies, \nRivers first sought federal habeas relief in August \n2017. Pet. App. 2a. The district court entered final \njudgment and denied Rivers\u2019 claims on the merits in \nSeptember 2018. Id. Rivers appealed from the denial, \nand the Fifth Circuit granted a certificate of \nappealability on his claim that his trial counsel was \n\n \n4 \n \nineffective for failing to conduct a reasonable \ninvestigation and interview witnesses. Id. The Fifth \nCircuit ultimately affirmed the district court\u2019s final \njudgment in May 2022. Pet. App. 3a.  \n \n \nBack in February 2021, while the appeal of his first \npetition was still pending, Rivers filed a second petition \nto challenge the same convictions. Pet. App. 2a. In the \nsecond petition, Rivers reasserted that his trial counsel \nwas ineffective and added a myriad of new claims. Id. \nRivers alleged that the new claims arose from \ninformation he gleaned from his attorney-client file, \nwhich he obtained in October 2019. Id. The district \ncourt found that it lacked jurisdiction over this petition \nbecause it was \u201csecond or successive\u201d to his previous \npetition and transferred it to the Fifth Circuit Pet. App. \n12a\u201319a. Pursuant to the transfer order, an original \nproceeding was docketed in the Fifth Circuit for Rivers \nto file a motion for authorization to file a successive \nhabeas petition. See In re Rivers, No. 21-10967 (5th Cir. \nSep. 24, 2021); see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3). Instead of \nmoving for authorization, Rivers filed a notice of appeal \nchallenging the district court\u2019s transfer order and \nurged the Fifth Circuit to construe his second petition \nas a motion to amend his first petition. Pet. App. 3a\u2013\n4a. The Fifth Circuit dismissed the authorization \nproceeding because Rivers never filed a supporting \nmotion. Order, In re Rivers, No. 21-10967 (5th Cir. Nov. \n15, 2021).  \n \n \nThe Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s \ntransfer order on April 15, 2024, holding that the \nsecond petition was successive and thus subject to the \nrequirements of \u00a7 2244. Pet. App. 11a. Rivers now \nseeks certiorari to challenge that decision. \n\n \n5 \n \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe Court Should Deny Certiorari Because \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s Decision Is Consistent \nwith, and Mandated by, This Court\u2019s Cases. \n \nCertiorari is unwarranted. The Fifth Circuit \ncorrectly held that Rivers\u2019 second petition is an \nunauthorized successive petition subject to the \nrequirements of \u00a7 2244(b). See Pet. App. 11a. This \nholding is consistent with Gonzalez and Banister. See \nGonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524 (2005) (holding that a \npost-judgment filing is a successive habeas petition if \nit advances habeas claims); Banister v. Davis, 590 U.S. \n504 (holding that a motion to amend or alter a \njudgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) \nis not successive because it is part of the final judgment \nin the initial habeas proceeding). \n \n \nThe restrictions on \u201csecond or successive\u201d federal \nhabeas petitions in \u00a7 2244(b) apply to Rivers\u2019 second \npetition because it challenged the same six-count \njudgment of conviction as his initial petition. See \nMagwood v. Patterson, 561 U.S. 320, 331 (2010) \n(holding that \u00a7 2244(b) applies \u201conly to a \u2018second or \nsuccessive\u2019 application challenging the same state-\ncourt judgment.\u201d). The Fifth Circuit properly relied on \nthis Court\u2019s analysis in Gonzalez to determine whether \nRivers\u2019 post-judgment \u201cmotion to amend\u201d his initial \nhabeas petition, i.e., his second habeas petition, was \n\u201csecond or successive\u201d to his initial habeas petition \nunder \u00a7 2244(b). Pet. App. 9a\u201310a (citing Gonzalez, 545 \nU.S. at 531\u201332). The court below found Rivers\u2019 second \npetition to be successive because it was a post-\njudgment filing that advanced habeas claims. Pet. App. \n\n \n6 \n \n9a\u201310a (\u201c[F]ilings introduced after a final judgment \nthat raise habeas claims, no matter how titled, are \ndeemed successive\u201d) (citing Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 531\u2013\n32). Chronology does not end the inquiry, however, as \nthis Court has clarified that not all habeas filings made \nafter an initial application qualify as \u201csecond or \nsuccessive.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 511\u201312; Magwood, \n561 U.S. at 332; Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U.S. 930, \n944 (2007).  \n \n \nThus, relying on Gonzalez, the Fifth Circuit \nproperly looked \u201cat the nature of the relief sought rather \nthan the filing\u2019s label to determine whether failing to \nsubject \n[Rivers\u2019 \nsecond \npetition] \nto \nthe \nsame \nrequirements would be inconsistent with the statute.\u201d \nPet. App. 10a (quoting Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 531) \n(cleaned up) (emphasis added). Although Rivers\u2019 \nsecond petition was characterized as a motion to \namend and not a Rule 60(b) motion, \u201cthat is a \ndistinction without a difference.\u201d Pet. App. 9a\u201310a \n(citing Gonzalez, 545 U.S. 527). His second petition\u2014\nthough \u201ccouched in the language\u201d of a motion to \namend\u2014was properly construed as a successive \npetition because it both \u201cattack[ed] the federal court\u2019s \nresolution of [his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel] \nclaim on the merits\u201d by raising ineffective assistance of \ncounsel yet again and \u201csought to add [] new grounds for \nrelief.\u201d Pet. App. 10a (citing Gonzalez, 545 U.S. 531\u2013\n32). AEDPA afforded Rivers one chance to challenge \nhis convictions, and he availed of that chance with his \ninitial habeas petition. See Magwood, 561 U.S. at 333\u2013\n34. The court below rightly relied on Gonzalez and saw \nRivers\u2019 second petition for what it was: an attempted \nsecond bite of the proverbial apple and thus subject to \nauthorization requirements of \u00a7 2244(b). The transfer \n\n \n7 \n \norder was not only correct; it was mandated. Failure to \nread Rivers\u2019 second petition in tandem with \u00a7 2244 \nwould have \u201ccircumvent[ed] the requirement that a \nsuccessive habeas petition be precertified by the court \nof appeals as falling within an exception to the \nsuccessive-petition bar.\u201d See Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 532 \n(citation and internal quotation omitted). \n \n \nRivers\u2019 complaint that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision \n\u201cignores this Court\u2019s guidance in Banister\u201d is wholly \nnon-sequitur. Pet. Cert. 13. As in Gonzalez, the final \njudgment of the initial habeas proceeding is the crux of \nthe inquiry in Banister. The Court explicitly \ndistinguished a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend a \njudgment as not subject to \u00a7 2244(b) because the \nmotion suspends the finality of the judgment, and the \nruling on the motion merges into the final judgment, \nthus ultimately making the Rule 59(e) motion \u201cpart \nand parcel\u201d of the initial habeas proceeding. Banister, \n590 U.S. at 507\u201309. This Court\u2019s holding in Gonzalez \nthat a post-judgment filing \u201ccounts as a second or \nsuccessive habeas application if it \u2018attacks the federal \ncourt\u2019s previous resolution of a claim on the merits\u2019 . . . \ndoes not alter that conclusion.\u201d Id. at 505 (citing \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. 532).  \n \n \nLike a Rule 60(b) motion that advances habeas \nclaims and would thus unequivocally count as a \nsuccessive petition, Rivers\u2019 second petition \u201cdiffers \nfrom a Rule 59(e) [motion] in just about every way that \nmatters to the inquiry here.\u201d See Banister, 590 U.S. at \n516. That is, Rivers\u2019 second petition is unlike a Rule \n59(e) motion in timing, scope, and procedural posture. \nA Rule 59(e) motion must be brought within 28 days of \nfinal judgment and requests only \u201creconsideration of \n\n \n8 \n \nmatters properly encompassed\u201d in the challenged \njudgment. Id. at 516. It is a \u201cone-time effort to bring \nalleged errors in a just-issued decision to a habeas \ncourt\u2019s attention, before taking a single appeal.\u201d Id. \nDespite Rivers\u2019 wishes, his second petition cannot be \ntreated akin to a Rule 59(e) motion as \u201cpart and parcel\u201d \nof his initial habeas proceeding because it was: (1) filed \nin a new, separately numbered district court \nproceeding; (2) more than 28 days after final judgment; \nand (3) exceeded the scope of claims that were raised \nin his initial petition. \n \n \nIn sum, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision comports with \nboth Gonzalez and Banister. Certiorari is unwarranted \nbecause this Court has provided sufficient guidance as \nto what constitutes a successive petition, and the lower \ncourt\u2019s analysis correctly relied on that guidance. The \nonly legally available way to merge Rivers\u2019 new habeas \nclaims \ninto \nhis \nfirst-in-time \npetition\u2019s \nalready \ncompleted judgment is a Rule 60(b) motion, which this \nCourt in Gonzalez already established would be a \nsuccessive petition. \n \nII. \nThe Court Should Deny Certiorari Because \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s Decision Is Consistent \nwith AEDPA\u2019s Aims. \n \nRivers argues that the lower court was wrong \nbecause its approach \u201cwould frustrate AEDPA\u2019s aims.\u201d \nPet. Cert. 27. His arguments have no force because he \ndisregards Congress\u2019 intent in enacting \u00a7 2244(b). \nOddly enough, Rivers faults the Fifth Circuit for not \nasking whether his filing \u201cwould have constituted an \nabuse of the writ,\u201d as the historical doctrine is \nexplained in Banister. Pet. Cert. 30 (citing Banister, \n\n \n9 \n \n590 U.S. at 512) (cleaned up). In doing so, Rivers \nsuggests that the abuse-of-the-writ doctrine should \nsupplant \u00a7 2244(b) as gatekeeper. However, this Court \nhas previously explained that the text of AEDPA as \nwritten\u2014and not pre-AEDPA doctrines like abuse of \nthe writ\u2014controls whether a filing is successive. See \nMagwood, 561 U.S. at 338 (\u201cIn light of this complex \nhistory of the phrase \u2018second or successive,\u2019 we must \nrely upon the current text to determine when the \nphrase applies, rather than pre-AEDPA precedents or \nsuperseded statutory formulations.\u201d).  \n \n \nMoreover, the debate over AEDPA reveals that \nCongress likely intended to override the pre-AEDPA \nlegal standards such as abuse of the writ. See, e.g., 141 \nCong. Rec. 15047 (1995) (\u201cWe are into that school that \nsays . . . drastically curtail the time within which \nsomeone is able to file a habeas petition and how many \ntimes they are able to file one and what constitutes a \nsuccessive petition\u201d); accord id. at 15054\u2013055 (\u201c[S]ome \nreform of habeas corpus is necessary. . . . I support \nlimits on successive, repetitive petitions.\u201d). The \nhistorical \nabuse-of-the-writ \ndoctrine \n\u201cwas \nmore \nforgiving than AEDPA\u2019s gatekeeping provision\u201d to the \nextent that successive petitions were a persistent, \nrecurring issue prior to AEDPA\u2019s enactment. See \nBanister, 590 U.S. at 514 (citing McCleskey v. Zant, 499 \nU.S. 467, 485 (1991)); 141 Cong. Rec. 15039 (\u201c[T]he \ncourt as well as the Congress has found that the writs \nof habeas corpus . . . the petition, more accurately, \nseeking a writ, has been used excessively. This has \nbeen happening for many, many years.\u201d). It thus \nfollows that more stringent amendment to \u00a7 2244(b) \nwas Congress\u2019 solution to curtail the problem of \nsuccessive habeas petitions, to serve as gatekeeper \n\n \n10 \n \nwhere the abuse-of-the-writ doctrine failed. The Fifth \nCircuit did not consider whether Rivers\u2019 second \npetition constituted abuse of the writ because the text \nof \u00a7 2244, not abuse of the writ, was the relevant \ninquiry. \n \nA. Congress determined that the application \nof AEDPA\u2019s successive bar conserves \njudicial \nresources, \nwhile \npre-AEDPA \ndoctrines wasted them. \n \nRivers suggests that the procedural impediments of \n\u00a7 2244(b) are, in of themselves, inefficient at conserving \njudicial resources. See Pet. Cert. 27\u201330 (\u201cIf section \n2244(b)(2) is a \u2018rock[y]\u2019 path for prisoners, that goes \ndouble for courts.\u201d) (quoting Banister, 590 U.S. at 509). \nIn other words, he suggests that the plain text of \n\u00a7 2244(b) should not control because the historical pre-\nAEDPA doctrines such as abuse of the writ better \nconserved judicial resources. See id. at 30 (\u201cHad \nCongress wanted all post-judgment habeas filings to \ncount as second or successive petitions, it easily could \nhave written such a law. But it\u2019s hard to squeeze that \nrule from the text of \u00a7 2244(b)(2) and the history \nagainst which it was written.\u201d).  \n \nBut Rivers\u2019 argument is inapposite, because \nCongress concluded that the pre-AEDPA legal \nstandards were inefficient and wasted judicial \nresources. Rivers cannot take issue with Congress\u2019 \npolicy determinations, and neither should the Court. \nSee Felker v. Turpin, 518 U.S. 651, 664 (1996) (\u201c[W]e \nhave likewise recognized that judgments about the \nproper scope of the writ are normally for Congress to \nmake.\u201d). Furthermore, Rivers ignores the fact that a \n\n \n11 \n \ncircuit court\u2019s authorization decision is not itself an \n\u201cappeal,\u201d and cannot be further appealed, either en \nbanc or to this Court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(E) (\u201cThe \ngrant or denial of an authorization by a court of appeals \nto file a second or successive application shall not be \nappealable and shall not be the subject of a petition for \nrehearing or for a writ of certiorari.\u201d). Because this \nlimitation represents the \u201cmaximum\u201d conservation of \njudicial resources, as contemplated by Congress, \nRivers\u2019 arguments necessarily expend more judicial \nresources in comparison. \n \n \nMoreover, it cannot follow that the district court \nshould have issued an indicative ruling on his second \npetition under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62.1 if \nit found that Rivers \u201cnew evidence was [not] worth the \ncandle.\u201d Pet. Cert. 29 (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 62.1). It \nwas the prerogative of the Fifth Circuit to assess the \nbasis of Rivers\u2019 new claims, had he complied with \nAEDPA\u2019s mandate that he move for authorization. See \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b). Such an analysis under \u00a7 2244(b) \nsupplants the ruling Rivers desired under Rule 62.1. \nAs this Court in Banister admonished, the restrictions \nof \u00a7 2244(b), \u201clike all statutes and rules pertaining to \nhabeas, trump any \u2018inconsistent\u2019 Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure \notherwise \napplicable \nto \nhabeas \nproceedings.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 509. This \nargument, too, falters. \n \n \n\n \n12 \n \nB. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s application of \u00a7 2244(b) \ndecreases piecemeal litigation.  \n \n \nRivers argues that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s approach \nincreases piecemeal litigation because the district \ncourt should have considered his second petition on the \nmerits rather than transfer it to the Fifth Circuit. Pet. \nCert. 29. Rivers again suggests that the procedural \nimpediments \nof \n\u00a7 \n2244(b) \nthemselves \npromote \npiecemeal litigation. First, Rivers\u2019 argument fails to \nacknowledge that the district court lacked authority to \nreopen the judgment while the denial of his first \npetition remained pending on appeal because it had no \njurisdiction to consider an \u201camended\u201d petition. Second, \nthe only way Rivers could have reopened the judgment \nto amend his first petition more than 28 days after final \njudgment would have been a Rule 60(b) motion, which \nwould be plainly successive under Gonzalez because it \nincreases piecemeal litigation.   \n \nC. Congress intended for AEDPA and its \nsuccessive bar to promote finality.  \n \n \nRivers argues that if the evidence that formed the \nbasis of his new claims \u201cisn\u2019t the bombshell that Rivers \nreckons,\u201d the district court should have denied the \nclaims in his second petition on the merits. Pet. Cert. \n29 (\u201cHad it done that, this case would be over.\u201d). But \nbecause the district court lacked jurisdiction to \nconsider the second petition, \u00a7 2244(b) required that \nthe court transfer it to the Fifth Circuit. Yet again, he \nsuggests that the procedural requirements of \u00a7 2244(b) \nare themselves impediments to conviction finality. Id. \nat 29\u201330 (\u201cInstead, the lower courts sent Rivers and \nTexas down a path that could prolong this case.\u201d).  \n\n \n13 \n \n \nIn enacting \u00a7 2244(b), Congress \u201caimed to prevent \nserial challenges to a judgment of conviction.\u201d Banister, \n590 U.S. at 515. Yet Rivers\u2019 proposed approach would \nallow petitioners to make an infinite number of post-\njudgment \u201camendments\u201d to an initial petition so long \nas that petition remains pending on appeal. See id. at \n521. Allowing petitioners to raise habeas claims ad \ninfinitum during the post-judgment pendency of the \ninitial petition runs contrary to \u00a7 2244(b)\u2019s purpose to \n\u201c\u2018conserve judicial resources, reduc[e] piecemeal \nlitigation,\u2019 and \u2018lend[ ] finality to state court judgments \nwithin a reasonable time.\u2019\u201d Id. at 512 (citing Panetti, \n551 U.S. at 945\u201346). In sum, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision \nbelow aligns with AEDPA and Congress\u2019 intent \ntherein. \n \nIII. \nThe Decision Below Is Fully Consistent \nwith the Majority of Circuit Courts to Have \nAddressed This Issue; the Court Should \nDeny Certiorari to Allow the Minority \nCircuits to Self-Correct. \n \nThe rule followed by the majority of circuits is \ncorrect, for the reasons explained above. The Fifth \nCircuit, along with the Fourth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, \nand Eleventh Circuits, all agree that an initial habeas \nproceeding is \u201cconcluded\u201d once the district court has \nissued a final judgment, regardless of a pending \nappeal; any later attempts to advance habeas claims \nare deemed succe\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n43: 20241015114816247_23-134520Rivers20Word20Count20Cert.json (score: 0.288)\nNo. 23-1345 \n \n \nIN THE \nSupreme Court of the United States \n \nDANNY RICHARD RIVERS, \nPetitioner, \nv. \n \nBOBBY LUMPKIN, DIRECTOR, TDCJ-CID,  \nRespondent. \n \nOn Petition for a Writ of Certiorari \nTo the Fifth Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit \n \nRESPONDENT\u2019S WORD COUNT CERTIFICATION \n \n \nAs required by Supreme Court Rule 33.1(h), I certify that the document \ncontains 3,965 words, excluding the parts of the document that are exempted \nby Supreme Court Rule 33.1(d).

At the \ntime he filed his second petition, the denial of his first \npetition was pending on appeal. \n \n \nIn lieu of Rivers\u2019 question presented, Respondent \nsuggests: \n \n \nDid the Fifth Circuit correctly hold that Rivers\u2019 \npost-judgment motion, which advanced habeas claims \nattacking his underlying convictions, was a successive \nhabeas petition subject to the gatekeeping provisions \nof 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244? \n  \n \n \n\n \nii \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nQuestion Presented ................................................... i \nTable of Contents ..................................................... ii \nIndex of Authorities ................................................. iii \nIntroduction ............................................................. 1 \nOpinions Below ........................................................ 1 \nJurisdiction .............................................................. 1 \nStatutory Provision Involved .................................... 1 \nStatement of the Case .............................................. 3 \nArgument ................................................................. 5 \nI. \nThe \nCourt \nShould \nDeny \nCertiorari \nBecause the Fifth Circuit\u2019s Decision Is \nConsistent with, and Mandated by, This \nCourt\u2019s Cases. .......................................... 5 \nII. \nThe \nCourt \nShould \nDeny \nCertiorari \nBecause the Fifth Circuit\u2019s Decision Is \nConsistent with AEDPA\u2019s Aims. ............ 8 \nIII. \nThe Decision Below Is Fully Consistent \nwith the Majority of Circuit Courts to \nHave Addressed This Issue; the Court \nShould Deny Certiorari to Allow the \nMinority Circuits to Self-Correct. ......... 13 \nConclusion .............................................................. 16 \n \n\n \niii \n \nINDEX OF AUTHORITIES \nCASES \nBanister v.

The court below\u2014and the majority of \nthe circuits\u2014have issued decisions fully consistent \nwith this Court\u2019s precedents and with AEDPA\u2019s clear \npurposes. The circuit majority rule minimizes the \nwaste of judicial resources, restricts piecemeal \nlitigation, and promotes the finality of criminal \nconvictions. \nThe \nremaining \ncircuits\u2014a \nsmall \nminority\u2014should self-correct, especially under the \nguidance of this Court\u2019s more recent decision in \nBanister v. Davis, 590 U.S. 504 (2020). Accordingly, \nRivers should be denied certiorari review. \n \nOPINIONS BELOW \n \nThe opinion of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals is \nreported at Rivers v. Lumpkin, 99 F.4th 216 (5th Cir. \n2024). Pet. App. 1a\u201311a. The district court\u2019s order \nadopting the magistrate judge\u2019s findings, conclusions, \nand \nrecommendation \n(Pet. \nApp. \n12a\u201317a), \nis \nunreported. Pet. App. 18a\u201319a. \n \n \nJURISDICTION \n \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment was entered on April \n15, 2024. Pet. App. 1a. This Court has jurisdiction \nunder the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1254(1) and \n2253(c). \n \nSTATUTORY PROVISION INVOLVED \n \nThe Question Presented involves the application of \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(a)\u2013(b): \n \n(a) No circuit or district judge shall be \n\n \n2 \n \nrequired to entertain an application for a \nwrit of habeas corpus to inquire into the \ndetention of a person pursuant to a \njudgment of a court of the United States \nif it appears that the legality of such \ndetention has been determined by a judge \nor court of the United States on a prior \napplication for a writ of habeas corpus, \nexcept as provided in section 2255. \n \n(b)(1) A claim presented in a second or \nsuccessive habeas corpus application \nunder section 2254 that was presented in \na prior application shall be dismissed. \n \n     (2) A claim presented in a second or \nsuccessive habeas corpus application \nunder \nsection \n2254 \nthat \nwas \nnot \npresented in a prior application shall be \ndismissed unless\u2014 \n(A) the applicant shows that the \nclaim relies on a new rule of \nconstitutional \nlaw, \nmade \nretroactive to cases on collateral \nreview by the Supreme Court, that \nwas previously unavailable; or \n(B)(i) the factual predicate for the \nclaim \ncould \nnot \nhave \nbeen \ndiscovered previously through the \nexercise of due diligence; and \n     (ii) the facts underlying the \nclaim, if proven and viewed in light \nof the evidence as a whole, would \nbe sufficient to establish by clear \nand convincing evidence that, but \n\n \n3 \n \nfor \nconstitutional \nerror, \nno \nreasonable factfinder would have \nfound the applicant guilty of the \nunderlying offense. \n \n    (3)(A) Before a second or successive \napplication permitted by this section is \nfiled in the district court, the applicant \nshall move in the appropriate court of \nappeals for an order authorizing the \ndistrict court to consider the application. \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE  \n \nA Texas jury found Rivers guilty of one count of \ncontinuous sexual abuse of a young child (Count I), two \ncounts of indecency with a child by contact (Counts II \nand III), one count of indecency with a child by \nexposure (Count IV), and two counts of possession of \nchild pornography (Counts V and VI). Rivers v. State, \nNo. 08-12-00145-CR, 2014 WL 3662569 (Tex. App.\u2014El \nPaso Jul. 23, 2014, pet. ref\u2019d). Rivers received \nsentences of thirty years\u2019 incarceration for Count I, \nthree years\u2019 incarceration each for Counts II and III, \nand two years\u2019 incarceration for Count IV, all to run \nconsecutively. Id.  He received two concurrent two-year \nsentences for Counts V and VI. Id. \n \n \nAfter exhausting his available state remedies, \nRivers first sought federal habeas relief in August \n2017. Pet. App. 2a. The district court entered final \njudgment and denied Rivers\u2019 claims on the merits in \nSeptember 2018. Id. Rivers appealed from the denial, \nand the Fifth Circuit granted a certificate of \nappealability on his claim that his trial counsel was \n\n \n4 \n \nineffective for failing to conduct a reasonable \ninvestigation and interview witnesses. Id. The Fifth \nCircuit ultimately affirmed the district court\u2019s final \njudgment in May 2022. Pet. App. 3a.  \n \n \nBack in February 2021, while the appeal of his first \npetition was still pending, Rivers filed a second petition \nto challenge the same convictions. Pet. App. 2a. In the \nsecond petition, Rivers reasserted that his trial counsel \nwas ineffective and added a myriad of new claims. Id. \nRivers alleged that the new claims arose from \ninformation he gleaned from his attorney-client file, \nwhich he obtained in October 2019. Id. The district \ncourt found that it lacked jurisdiction over this petition \nbecause it was \u201csecond or successive\u201d to his previous \npetition and transferred it to the Fifth Circuit Pet. App. \n12a\u201319a. Pursuant to the transfer order, an original \nproceeding was docketed in the Fifth Circuit for Rivers \nto file a motion for authorization to file a successive \nhabeas petition. See In re Rivers, No. 21-10967 (5th Cir. \nSep. 24, 2021); see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3). Instead of \nmoving for authorization, Rivers filed a notice of appeal \nchallenging the district court\u2019s transfer order and \nurged the Fifth Circuit to construe his second petition \nas a motion to amend his first petition. Pet. App. 3a\u2013\n4a. The Fifth Circuit dismissed the authorization \nproceeding because Rivers never filed a supporting \nmotion. Order, In re Rivers, No. 21-10967 (5th Cir. Nov. \n15, 2021).  \n \n \nThe Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s \ntransfer order on April 15, 2024, holding that the \nsecond petition was successive and thus subject to the \nrequirements of \u00a7 2244. Pet. App. 11a. Rivers now \nseeks certiorari to challenge that decision. \n\n \n5 \n \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe Court Should Deny Certiorari Because \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s Decision Is Consistent \nwith, and Mandated by, This Court\u2019s Cases. \n \nCertiorari is unwarranted. The Fifth Circuit \ncorrectly held that Rivers\u2019 second petition is an \nunauthorized successive petition subject to the \nrequirements of \u00a7 2244(b). See Pet. App. 11a. This \nholding is consistent with Gonzalez and Banister. See \nGonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524 (2005) (holding that a \npost-judgment filing is a successive habeas petition if \nit advances habeas claims); Banister v. Davis, 590 U.S. \n504 (holding that a motion to amend or alter a \njudgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) \nis not successive because it is part of the final judgment \nin the initial habeas proceeding). \n \n \nThe restrictions on \u201csecond or successive\u201d federal \nhabeas petitions in \u00a7 2244(b) apply to Rivers\u2019 second \npetition because it challenged the same six-count \njudgment of conviction as his initial petition. See \nMagwood v. Patterson, 561 U.S. 320, 331 (2010) \n(holding that \u00a7 2244(b) applies \u201conly to a \u2018second or \nsuccessive\u2019 application challenging the same state-\ncourt judgment.\u201d). The Fifth Circuit properly relied on \nthis Court\u2019s analysis in Gonzalez to determine whether \nRivers\u2019 post-judgment \u201cmotion to amend\u201d his initial \nhabeas petition, i.e., his second habeas petition, was \n\u201csecond or successive\u201d to his initial habeas petition \nunder \u00a7 2244(b). Pet. App. 9a\u201310a (citing Gonzalez, 545 \nU.S. at 531\u201332). The court below found Rivers\u2019 second \npetition to be successive because it was a post-\njudgment filing that advanced habeas claims. Pet. App. \n\n \n6 \n \n9a\u201310a (\u201c[F]ilings introduced after a final judgment \nthat raise habeas claims, no matter how titled, are \ndeemed successive\u201d) (citing Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 531\u2013\n32). Chronology does not end the inquiry, however, as \nthis Court has clarified that not all habeas filings made \nafter an initial application qualify as \u201csecond or \nsuccessive.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 511\u201312; Magwood, \n561 U.S. at 332; Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U.S. 930, \n944 (2007).  \n \n \nThus, relying on Gonzalez, the Fifth Circuit \nproperly looked \u201cat the nature of the relief sought rather \nthan the filing\u2019s label to determine whether failing to \nsubject \n[Rivers\u2019 \nsecond \npetition] \nto \nthe \nsame \nrequirements would be inconsistent with the statute.\u201d \nPet. App. 10a (quoting Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 531) \n(cleaned up) (emphasis added). Although Rivers\u2019 \nsecond petition was characterized as a motion to \namend and not a Rule 60(b) motion, \u201cthat is a \ndistinction without a difference.\u201d Pet. App. 9a\u201310a \n(citing Gonzalez, 545 U.S. 527). His second petition\u2014\nthough \u201ccouched in the language\u201d of a motion to \namend\u2014was properly construed as a successive \npetition because it both \u201cattack[ed] the federal court\u2019s \nresolution of [his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel] \nclaim on the merits\u201d by raising ineffective assistance of \ncounsel yet again and \u201csought to add [] new grounds for \nrelief.\u201d Pet. App. 10a (citing Gonzalez, 545 U.S. 531\u2013\n32). AEDPA afforded Rivers one chance to challenge \nhis convictions, and he availed of that chance with his \ninitial habeas petition. See Magwood, 561 U.S. at 333\u2013\n34. The court below rightly relied on Gonzalez and saw \nRivers\u2019 second petition for what it was: an attempted \nsecond bite of the proverbial apple and thus subject to \nauthorization requirements of \u00a7 2244(b). The transfer \n\n \n7 \n \norder was not only correct; it was mandated. Failure to \nread Rivers\u2019 second petition in tandem with \u00a7 2244 \nwould have \u201ccircumvent[ed] the requirement that a \nsuccessive habeas petition be precertified by the court \nof appeals as falling within an exception to the \nsuccessive-petition bar.\u201d See Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 532 \n(citation and internal quotation omitted). \n \n \nRivers\u2019 complaint that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision \n\u201cignores this Court\u2019s guidance in Banister\u201d is wholly \nnon-sequitur. Pet. Cert. 13. As in Gonzalez, the final \njudgment of the initial habeas proceeding is the crux of \nthe inquiry in Banister. The Court explicitly \ndistinguished a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend a \njudgment as not subject to \u00a7 2244(b) because the \nmotion suspends the finality of the judgment, and the \nruling on the motion merges into the final judgment, \nthus ultimately making the Rule 59(e) motion \u201cpart \nand parcel\u201d of the initial habeas proceeding. Banister, \n590 U.S. at 507\u201309. This Court\u2019s holding in Gonzalez \nthat a post-judgment filing \u201ccounts as a second or \nsuccessive habeas application if it \u2018attacks the federal \ncourt\u2019s previous resolution of a claim on the merits\u2019 . . . \ndoes not alter that conclusion.\u201d Id. at 505 (citing \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. 532).  \n \n \nLike a Rule 60(b) motion that advances habeas \nclaims and would thus unequivocally count as a \nsuccessive petition, Rivers\u2019 second petition \u201cdiffers \nfrom a Rule 59(e) [motion] in just about every way that \nmatters to the inquiry here.\u201d See Banister, 590 U.S. at \n516. That is, Rivers\u2019 second petition is unlike a Rule \n59(e) motion in timing, scope, and procedural posture. \nA Rule 59(e) motion must be brought within 28 days of \nfinal judgment and requests only \u201creconsideration of \n\n \n8 \n \nmatters properly encompassed\u201d in the challenged \njudgment. Id. at 516. It is a \u201cone-time effort to bring \nalleged errors in a just-issued decision to a habeas \ncourt\u2019s attention, before taking a single appeal.\u201d Id. \nDespite Rivers\u2019 wishes, his second petition cannot be \ntreated akin to a Rule 59(e) motion as \u201cpart and parcel\u201d \nof his initial habeas proceeding because it was: (1) filed \nin a new, separately numbered district court \nproceeding; (2) more than 28 days after final judgment; \nand (3) exceeded the scope of claims that were raised \nin his initial petition. \n \n \nIn sum, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision comports with \nboth Gonzalez and Banister. Certiorari is unwarranted \nbecause this Court has provided sufficient guidance as \nto what constitutes a successive petition, and the lower \ncourt\u2019s analysis correctly relied on that guidance. The \nonly legally available way to merge Rivers\u2019 new habeas \nclaims \ninto \nhis \nfirst-in-time \npetition\u2019s \nalready \ncompleted judgment is a Rule 60(b) motion, which this \nCourt in Gonzalez already established would be a \nsuccessive petition. \n \nII. \nThe Court Should Deny Certiorari Because \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s Decision Is Consistent \nwith AEDPA\u2019s Aims. \n \nRivers argues that the lower court was wrong \nbecause its approach \u201cwould frustrate AEDPA\u2019s aims.\u201d \nPet. Cert. 27. His arguments have no force because he \ndisregards Congress\u2019 intent in enacting \u00a7 2244(b). \nOddly enough, Rivers faults the Fifth Circuit for not \nasking whether his filing \u201cwould have constituted an \nabuse of the writ,\u201d as the historical doctrine is \nexplained in Banister. Pet. Cert. 30 (citing Banister, \n\n \n9 \n \n590 U.S. at 512) (cleaned up). In doing so, Rivers \nsuggests that the abuse-of-the-writ doctrine should \nsupplant \u00a7 2244(b) as gatekeeper. However, this Court \nhas previously explained that the text of AEDPA as \nwritten\u2014and not pre-AEDPA doctrines like abuse of \nthe writ\u2014controls whether a filing is successive. See \nMagwood, 561 U.S. at 338 (\u201cIn light of this complex \nhistory of the phrase \u2018second or successive,\u2019 we must \nrely upon the current text to determine when the \nphrase applies, rather than pre-AEDPA precedents or \nsuperseded statutory formulations.\u201d).  \n \n \nMoreover, the debate over AEDPA reveals that \nCongress likely intended to override the pre-AEDPA \nlegal standards such as abuse of the writ. See, e.g., 141 \nCong. Rec. 15047 (1995) (\u201cWe are into that school that \nsays . . . drastically curtail the time within which \nsomeone is able to file a habeas petition and how many \ntimes they are able to file one and what constitutes a \nsuccessive petition\u201d); accord id. at 15054\u2013055 (\u201c[S]ome \nreform of habeas corpus is necessary. . . . I support \nlimits on successive, repetitive petitions.\u201d). The \nhistorical \nabuse-of-the-writ \ndoctrine \n\u201cwas \nmore \nforgiving than AEDPA\u2019s gatekeeping provision\u201d to the \nextent that successive petitions were a persistent, \nrecurring issue prior to AEDPA\u2019s enactment. See \nBanister, 590 U.S. at 514 (citing McCleskey v. Zant, 499 \nU.S. 467, 485 (1991)); 141 Cong. Rec. 15039 (\u201c[T]he \ncourt as well as the Congress has found that the writs \nof habeas corpus . . . the petition, more accurately, \nseeking a writ, has been used excessively. This has \nbeen happening for many, many years.\u201d). It thus \nfollows that more stringent amendment to \u00a7 2244(b) \nwas Congress\u2019 solution to curtail the problem of \nsuccessive habeas petitions, to serve as gatekeeper \n\n \n10 \n \nwhere the abuse-of-the-writ doctrine failed. The Fifth \nCircuit did not consider whether Rivers\u2019 second \npetition constituted abuse of the writ because the text \nof \u00a7 2244, not abuse of the writ, was the relevant \ninquiry. \n \nA. Congress determined that the application \nof AEDPA\u2019s successive bar conserves \njudicial \nresources, \nwhile \npre-AEDPA \ndoctrines wasted them. \n \nRivers suggests that the procedural impediments of \n\u00a7 2244(b) are, in of themselves, inefficient at conserving \njudicial resources. See Pet. Cert. 27\u201330 (\u201cIf section \n2244(b)(2) is a \u2018rock[y]\u2019 path for prisoners, that goes \ndouble for courts.\u201d) (quoting Banister, 590 U.S. at 509). \nIn other words, he suggests that the plain text of \n\u00a7 2244(b) should not control because the historical pre-\nAEDPA doctrines such as abuse of the writ better \nconserved judicial resources. See id. at 30 (\u201cHad \nCongress wanted all post-judgment habeas filings to \ncount as second or successive petitions, it easily could \nhave written such a law. But it\u2019s hard to squeeze that \nrule from the text of \u00a7 2244(b)(2) and the history \nagainst which it was written.\u201d).  \n \nBut Rivers\u2019 argument is inapposite, because \nCongress concluded that the pre-AEDPA legal \nstandards were inefficient and wasted judicial \nresources. Rivers cannot take issue with Congress\u2019 \npolicy determinations, and neither should the Court. \nSee Felker v. Turpin, 518 U.S. 651, 664 (1996) (\u201c[W]e \nhave likewise recognized that judgments about the \nproper scope of the writ are normally for Congress to \nmake.\u201d). Furthermore, Rivers ignores the fact that a \n\n \n11 \n \ncircuit court\u2019s authorization decision is not itself an \n\u201cappeal,\u201d and cannot be further appealed, either en \nbanc or to this Court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(E) (\u201cThe \ngrant or denial of an authorization by a court of appeals \nto file a second or successive application shall not be \nappealable and shall not be the subject of a petition for \nrehearing or for a writ of certiorari.\u201d). Because this \nlimitation represents the \u201cmaximum\u201d conservation of \njudicial resources, as contemplated by Congress, \nRivers\u2019 arguments necessarily expend more judicial \nresources in comparison. \n \n \nMoreover, it cannot follow that the district court \nshould have issued an indicative ruling on his second \npetition under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62.1 if \nit found that Rivers \u201cnew evidence was [not] worth the \ncandle.\u201d Pet. Cert. 29 (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 62.1). It \nwas the prerogative of the Fifth Circuit to assess the \nbasis of Rivers\u2019 new claims, had he complied with \nAEDPA\u2019s mandate that he move for authorization. See \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b). Such an analysis under \u00a7 2244(b) \nsupplants the ruling Rivers desired under Rule 62.1. \nAs this Court in Banister admonished, the restrictions \nof \u00a7 2244(b), \u201clike all statutes and rules pertaining to \nhabeas, trump any \u2018inconsistent\u2019 Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure \notherwise \napplicable \nto \nhabeas \nproceedings.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 509. This \nargument, too, falters. \n \n \n\n \n12 \n \nB. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s application of \u00a7 2244(b) \ndecreases piecemeal litigation.  \n \n \nRivers argues that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s approach \nincreases piecemeal litigation because the district \ncourt should have considered his second petition on the \nmerits rather than transfer it to the Fifth Circuit. Pet. \nCert. 29. Rivers again suggests that the procedural \nimpediments \nof \n\u00a7 \n2244(b) \nthemselves \npromote \npiecemeal litigation. First, Rivers\u2019 argument fails to \nacknowledge that the district court lacked authority to \nreopen the judgment while the denial of his first \npetition remained pending on appeal because it had no \njurisdiction to consider an \u201camended\u201d petition. Second, \nthe only way Rivers could have reopened the judgment \nto amend his first petition more than 28 days after final \njudgment would have been a Rule 60(b) motion, which \nwould be plainly successive under Gonzalez because it \nincreases piecemeal litigation.   \n \nC. Congress intended for AEDPA and its \nsuccessive bar to promote finality.  \n \n \nRivers argues that if the evidence that formed the \nbasis of his new claims \u201cisn\u2019t the bombshell that Rivers \nreckons,\u201d the district court should have denied the \nclaims in his second petition on the merits. Pet. Cert. \n29 (\u201cHad it done that, this case would be over.\u201d). But \nbecause the district court lacked jurisdiction to \nconsider the second petition, \u00a7 2244(b) required that \nthe court transfer it to the Fifth Circuit. Yet again, he \nsuggests that the procedural requirements of \u00a7 2244(b) \nare themselves impediments to conviction finality. Id. \nat 29\u201330 (\u201cInstead, the lower courts sent Rivers and \nTexas down a path that could prolong this case.\u201d).  \n\n \n13 \n \n \nIn enacting \u00a7 2244(b), Congress \u201caimed to prevent \nserial challenges to a judgment of conviction.\u201d Banister, \n590 U.S. at 515. Yet Rivers\u2019 proposed approach would \nallow petitioners to make an infinite number of post-\njudgment \u201camendments\u201d to an initial petition so long \nas that petition remains pending on appeal. See id. at \n521. Allowing petitioners to raise habeas claims ad \ninfinitum during the post-judgment pendency of the \ninitial petition runs contrary to \u00a7 2244(b)\u2019s purpose to \n\u201c\u2018conserve judicial resources, reduc[e] piecemeal \nlitigation,\u2019 and \u2018lend[ ] finality to state court judgments \nwithin a reasonable time.\u2019\u201d Id. at 512 (citing Panetti, \n551 U.S. at 945\u201346). In sum, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision \nbelow aligns with AEDPA and Congress\u2019 intent \ntherein. \n \nIII. \nThe Decision Below Is Fully Consistent \nwith the Majority of Circuit Courts to Have \nAddressed This Issue; the Court Should \nDeny Certiorari to Allow the Minority \nCircuits to Self-Correct. \n \nThe rule followed by the majority of circuits is \ncorrect, for the reasons explained above. The Fifth \nCircuit, along with the Fourth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, \nand Eleventh Circuits, all agree that an initial habeas \nproceeding is \u201cconcluded\u201d once the district court has \nissued a final judgment, regardless of a pending \nappeal; any later attempts to advance habeas claims \nare deemed successive under \u00a7 2244(b). See Bixby v. \nStirling, 90 F.4th 140 (4th Cir. 2024); Phillips v. United \nStates, 668 F.3d 433, 435 (7th Cir. 2012); Williams v. \nNorris, 461 F.3d 999, 1003 (8th Cir. 2006); Beaty v. \nSchriro, 554 F.3d 780, 783 n.1 (9th Cir. 2009); Ochoa v. \nSirmons, 485 F.3d 538, 540 (10th Cir. 2007); Boyd v. \n\n \n14 \n \nSec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corr., 114 F.4th 1232, 1239 (11th Cir. \n2024). \n \n \nThe Fourth and Eleventh Circuits most recently \nissued clear decisions aligning with the majority view. \nBixby, 90 F.4th at 146\u201350 (relying on Gonzalez, the \nFourth Circuit determined this year that under \nAEDPA, only it may authorize a second or successive \nhabeas petition); Boyd, 114 F.4th at 1239 (finding that, \neven if filed during an appeal for an adjudicated \n\u201cearlier application,\u201d a habeas petition or motion \u201cthat \npresents new evidence in support of a claim\u201d should be \ndeemed \nsuccessive \nand \n\u201c\u2018treated \naccordingly.\u2019\u201d) \n(quoting Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 531). This position\u2014\nthat upon a final judgment by the district court, if a \npetitioner wishes to present new claims or new \nevidence for old claims during the pendency of an \nappeal, AEDPA grants only the circuit courts the \npower to authorize. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). \n \n \nThe Seventh Circuit, along with the Eighth and \nNinth, have had long-standing views on this issue, \nfinding that upon an appeal, a habeas petitioner\u2019s \nadditional claims would be successive. Phillips, 668 \nF.3d at 435; Williams v. Norris, 461 F.3d at 1003; Beaty \nv. Schriro, 554 F.3d at 783 n.1. As the Seventh Circuit \nwarned, ruling otherwise would allow a petitioner to \n\u201cfile[] an entirely independent \u00a7 2255 petition raising a \ndistinct claim of relief; indeed, he could still file one or \nmore, as many as he likes, because this appeal is not \nover.\u201d Phillips, 668 F.3d at 435. As such, \u201c[t]reating \nmotions filed during appeal as part of the original \napplication,\u201d would potentially \u201cdrain most force from \nthe time-and-number limits,\u201d of AEDPA. Id. A district \n\n \n15 \n \ncourt\u2019s final judgment, therefore, must \u201cmark[] the \nterminal point.\u201d Id. \n \n \nBy contrast, only the Second and Third Circuits \nhave ruled that a petition is not successive if filed \nduring the pendency of the initial petition\u2019s appeal.  \nWhab v. United States, 408 F.3d 116, 118 (2d Cir. \n2005); United States v. Santarelli, 929 F.3d 95, 106 (3d \nCir. 2019) (holding that a prior proceeding has not \nconcluded for purposes of \u00a7 2244(b) until all appeals \nhave been exhausted.).  \n \n \nTo strengthen his circuit-split argument, Rivers \nasserts that the Tenth Circuit applies a \u201cseven-factor \ntest\u201d to determine if a petitioner may supplement an \ninitial petition before the district court rendered \njudgment. Pet. Cert. 19\u201320. In Douglas v. Workman, \n560 F.3d 1156 (10th Cir. 2009), the Tenth Circuit \ncarved out an exception for prosecutorial misconduct \nclaims to its normal rule concerning AEDPA\u2019s bar of \nsuccessive petitions. Specifically, when the \u201cprosecutor \nacted \nwillfully, \nand \nnot \njust \nnegligently \nor \ninadvertently, \nhis \nconduct \nwarrants \nspecial \ncondemnation and justifies permitting [the petitioner] \nto supplement his initial habeas petition.\u201d Id. at 1190. \nThat court then laid out \u201cseven factors on which [it \nbased \nits] \nconclusion\u201d \nthat \na \npetitioner \nmay \nsupplement. Id. at 1190\u201396. But to be clear, the Tenth \nCircuit has explicitly declined to follow the Second \nCircuit\u2019s position detailed in Whab, 408 F.3d 116, for \nmost second petitions filed during the appeal of the \ninitial habeas petition. Ochoa, 485 F.3d at 540. Indeed, \nthe Tenth Circuit stated that the minority rule \u201cwould \ngreatly undermine the policy against piecemeal \nlitigation embodied in \u00a7 2244(b).\u201d Id. \n\n \n16 \n \n \nNevertheless, there is a mature circuit split on \nwhether \u00a7 2244(b) applies to post-judgment motions \nfiled when the initial habeas application is pending on \nappeal. Moreover, this is a jurisdictional question, and \nthis Court has repeatedly described the importance of \nclear jurisdictional rules. See, e.g., Lapides v. Bd. of \nRegents of Univ. Sys. Of Georgia, 535 U.S. 613, 621 \n(2002). Thus, this could be a sufficient basis to justify \ncertiorari, even if only to affirm the majority rule. \n \n \nOn the other hand, the circuits are not \u201cintractably\u201d \nsplit as Rivers claims, nor is it certain that \u201cthe conflict \nwon\u2019t disappear on its own.\u201d See Pet. Cert. 2. Even \nlooking at Rivers\u2019 assertions more favorably, all of the \ncourts that do or could take the minority view\u2014the \nSecond, Third, and Tenth Circuits\u2014lacked the \nguidance and historical examination of AEDPA from \nthis Court\u2019s intervening decision in Banister. See, e.g., \nWhab, 408 F.3d at 118 (decided fifteen years prior to \nBanister); Santarelli, 929 F.3d at 106 (decided one year \nprior); Douglas, 560 F.3d at 1196 (decided eleven years \nprior). Certiorari is unwarranted at this stage because \nthe minority circuits have yet to self-correct. This \nCould should grant certiorari only if they fail to do so \nat the next opportunity. \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nBased on the foregoing reasons, the petition for a \nwrit of certiorari should be denied. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n17 \n \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \nKEN PAXTON \n \nAttorney General of Texas \n \n \n \nBRENT WEBSTER \n \nFirst Assistant Attorney \n \nGeneral \n \n \n \nJOSH RENO \n \nDeputy Attorney General for \n \nCriminal Justice \n \n \n \nEDWARD L.

The petition contains the petitioner's core legal arguments, the precise question presented, and the justification for the Court's review (e.g., a circuit split). Without this information, any prediction is impossible. This action directly plans to acquire the most crucial missing piece of information.\n\nDesign EIG is also high (0.7) because this action demonstrates a fundamental and generalizable principle of SCOTUS case analysis: always start with the petition for certiorari.

Davis, 590 U.S. \n504, 509 (2020). After that, the stringent gatekeeping \nrequirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2) bar nearly all \nattempts to file a \u201csecond or successive habeas corpus \napplication.\u201d Here, petitioner sought to amend his in-\nitial habeas application while it was pending on ap-\npeal. The Fifth Circuit applied \u00a7 2244(b)(2) and re-\njected the amended filing. \nThe circuits are intractably split on whether \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies to such filings. The Fifth, Sixth, \nSeventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits hold \nthat \u00a7 2244(b)(2) categorically applies to all second-\nin-time habeas filings made after the district court \nenters final judgment. The Second Circuit disagrees, \napplying \u00a7 2244(b)(2) only after a petitioner exhausts \nappellate review of his initial petition. And the Third \nand Tenth Circuits exempt some second-in-time fil-\nings from \u00a7 2244(b)(2), depending on whether a pris-\noner prevails on his initial appeal (Third Circuit) or \nsatisfies a seven-factor test (Tenth Circuit). \nThe question presented is: \nWhether \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies (i) only to habeas fil-\nings made after a prisoner has exhausted appellate \nreview of his first petition, (ii) to all second-in-time \nhabeas filings after final judgment, or (iii) to some \nsecond-in-time filings, depending on a prisoner\u2019s suc-\ncess on appeal or ability to satisfy a seven-factor test. \n \n\nii \n \nRELATED PROCEEDINGS \nEx parte Rivers, WR-84,550-01 & 84,550-02 (Tex. \nCt.

Nine cir-\ncuits have split four ways over that question, and on-\nly this Court can resolve the conflict. \n1. This case is about the hurdles that a prisoner \nmust clear before a court will hear him out. Petitioner \nDanny Rivers sought habeas relief, arguing that his \ncounsel had failed to investigate his case and had \nshown up to trial drunk. The district court denied the \npetition, finding that Rivers couldn\u2019t explain what his \nlawyer should have done differently or why that \nwould have changed things. But the answer soon \nemerged. After fighting for years to obtain his coun-\nsel\u2019s records, Rivers finally received them while his \ninitial petition was up on appeal. Among the files, \nRivers found an exculpatory report suggesting that \nhe was wrongly convicted\u2014evidence that his lawyers \nnever once mentioned at trial.  \nNew evidence in hand, Rivers raced to court\u2014only \nto find the doors barred. Applying \u00a7 2244(b)(2), the \ndistrict court reasoned that it was \u201cwithout jurisdic-\ntion to entertain\u201d the new evidence because Rivers\u2019s \nfiling counted as a \u201csecond or successive\u201d petition. \nPet. App. 19a. (Never mind that his first petition was \nstill pending on appeal and would be for nearly a \nyear.) The Fifth Circuit affirmed, explaining that \u201cfil-\nings introduced after a final judgment that raise ha-\nbeas claims\u201d are \u201cdeemed successive.\u201d Pet. App. 10a. \n\n2 \n \n \n2. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision deepens a circuit con-\nflict over when \u00a7 2244(b)(2) kicks in. In the Second \nCircuit, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) doesn\u2019t apply until a prisoner \nhas exhausted appellate review of his initial habeas \npetition\u2014leaving district courts free to consider a fil-\ning like Rivers\u2019s. As then-Judge Sotomayor put it, \nthat approach guarantees \u201cone full opportunity to \nseek collateral review.\u201d Ching v. United States, 298 \nF.3d 174, 177 (2d Cir. 2002). But the Fifth Circuit ex-\npressly \u201cdecline[d] \u2026 to embrace\u201d that rule. Pet. App. \n10a. Instead, it joined the Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, \nNinth, and Eleventh Circuits in applying \u00a7 2244(b)(2) \nafter the district court enters final judgment. That \napproach effectively grants \u201cone full opportunity to \nseek collateral review in the district court.\u201d United \nStates v. Santarelli, 929 F.3d 95, 104 (3d Cir. 2019) \n(cleaned up). Meanwhile, the Third and Tenth Cir-\ncuits follow their own unique approaches, holding \nthat \u00a7 2244(b)(2) sometimes applies between final \njudgment and exhaustion and sometimes doesn\u2019t. \nThree circuits have already denied rehearing en banc, \nand the rest show no sign of rethinking their views. \nIn short: the circuits are intractably split, the con-\nflict won\u2019t disappear on its own, and this Court\u2019s \nguidance is badly needed. See Balbuena v. Sullivan, \n970 F.3d 1176, 1197, 1200 (9th Cir. 2020) (Fletcher, \nJ., concurring in the result) (\u201curg[ing] the Supreme \nCourt to recognize\u201d and \u201cresolve the conflict\u201d).  \n3. The decision below is also wrong. In Banister v. \nDavis, 590 U.S. 504 (2020), this Court explained that \nthe phrase \u201csecond or successive\u201d is a term of art that \ndoesn\u2019t simply refer to every second-in-time habeas \nfiling. Instead, the Court has looked to historical \npractice and statutory aims when determining \nwhether \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies. But the Fifth Circuit \n\n3 \n \n \ndidn\u2019t even cite Banister, let alone follow its guidance. \nHad it done so, the court would have realized that its \nrule doesn\u2019t square with history. Early courts analyz-\ning abuses of the writ treated appellate review\u2014not \nfinal judgment\u2014as the relevant inflection point. \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s approach will also frustrate \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2)\u2019s aims. At bottom, the question is not \nwhether prisoners like Rivers will try to bring new \nevidence to the courts\u2019 attention. (They will\u2014no mat-\nter what rule this Court adopts.) The question in-\nstead is which court will consider that evidence first. \nUnder the Second Circuit\u2019s approach, a filing like \nRivers\u2019s would have gone to the district court that \njust denied the initial petition: the single member of \nArticle III most familiar with the case. That judge \ncould then have weighed the new evidence and decid-\ned whether to issue an indicative ruling under Feder-\nal Rule of Civil Procedure 62.1. By contrast, the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s rule requires Rivers to ask a brand-new \nthree-judge panel for permission to ask the district \ncourt to consider whether or not to reach the merits. \nIt\u2019s hard to squeeze that rule from the statutory \ntext\u2014and harder still to attribute it to a Congress fo-\ncused on judicial economy, efficiency, and finality. \n4. The question presented is important, and this \ncase is an ideal vehicle. Until this Court weighs in, at \nleast some states and prisoners will be living under \nthe wrong rule, and those in the outstanding circuits \nwill have to guess which rule applies. The interests \non both sides are too critical to leave up to geograph-\nical chance. The split is also outcome-determinative \nhere: if Rivers were incarcerated in New York instead \nof Texas, courts would have considered the new evi-\ndence, giving him a meaningful path to relief. \nThe Court should grant review. \n\n4 \n \n \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe court of appeals\u2019 opinion is reported at 99 F.4th \n216 and is reproduced in the appendix to this petition \nat Pet. App. 1a\u201311a. The district court\u2019s opinion is \nunpublished but is available at 2021 WL 4319670 and \nis reproduced at Pet. App. 12a\u201317a. \nJURISDICTION \nThe Fifth Circuit issued its judgment on April 15, \n2024. Pet. App. 1a. This Court has jurisdiction under \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISION INVOLVED \nSection 2244(b)(2) of Title 28, U.S. Code, provides: \nA claim presented in a second or successive ha-\nbeas corpus application under section 2254 that \nwas not presented in a prior application shall be \ndismissed unless\u2014 \n(A) the applicant shows that the claim relies on \na new rule of constitutional law, made retroac-\ntive to cases on collateral review by the Su-\npreme Court, that was previously unavailable; \nor \n(B)(i) the factual predicate for the claim could \nnot have been discovered previously through \nthe exercise of due diligence; and \n(ii) the facts underlying the claim, if proven \nand viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, \nwould be sufficient to establish by clear and \nconvincing evidence that, but for constitutional \nerror, no reasonable factfinder would have \nfound the applicant guilty of the underlying of-\nfense. \n\n5 \n \n \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal background \n1. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty \nAct of 1996 creates a dual-track system for federal \nhabeas relief. One path is for first-time petitioners. \n\u201cUnder AEDPA, a state prisoner always gets one \nchance to bring a federal habeas challenge to his con-\nviction.\u201d Banister v. Davis, 590 U.S. 504, 509 (2020). \nThis path begins in the district court. If that court \ndenies relief, the prisoner may request a \u201ccertificate \nof appealability\u201d\u2014initially from the district court, \nand then from the court of appeals. See Gonzalez v. \nThaler, 565 U.S. 134, 140 & n.5 (2012). The path ends \nonly when the prisoner has exhausted the chance to \nappeal and seek certiorari. \nThe second path is \u201crockier.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at \n509. A prisoner who wants to file a \u201csecond or succes-\nsive \nhabeas \ncorpus \napplication,\u201d \n28 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2), must first ask the court of appeals for \n\u201can order authorizing the district court to consider \nthe application,\u201d id. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). The appellate \ncourt may oblige only if the prisoner makes a \u201cprima \nfacie showing,\u201d id. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(C), that the petition \n\u201crelies on a new and retroactive rule of constitutional \nlaw\u201d or \u201calleges previously undiscoverable facts that \nwould establish \u2026 innocence,\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at \n509 (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2)). If so, the petition \ngoes to the district court, which must decide for itself \nwhether the petition \u201csatisfies the requirements\u201d of \n\u00a7 2244. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(4). At the same time, be-\ncause any claim \u201cpresented in a prior application\u201d \nmust be dismissed, \u00a7 2244(b)(1), both courts must \ncarefully compare the new petition to all prior peti-\ntions to determine precisely what \u201cclaims\u201d the prison-\n\n6 \n \n \ner has brought. Only then\u2014after all that is done\u2014\nmay the district court reach the merits. \nThe upshot is that much rides on whether \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies\u2014that is: on whether a filing is \ndeemed \u201cpart and parcel of the first habeas proceed-\ning,\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 507, or instead a \u201csecond \nor successive habeas corpus application,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2).  \n2. The phrase \u201csecond or successive\u201d is a \u201cterm of \nart\u201d that does not refer simply to \u201call habeas filings \u2026 \nfollowing an initial application.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at \n511 (first quoting Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, \n486 (2000), then quoting Magwood, 561 U.S. at 332 \n(2010)). To determine when \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies, \u201cthis \nCourt has looked for guidance in two main places.\u201d \nId. at 512. First, the Court has considered history: \n\u201cwhether a type of later-in-time filing would have \nconstituted an abuse of the writ\u201d under the Court\u2019s  \n\u201cpre-AEDPA cases.\u201d Id. (cleaned up) (quoting Panetti \nv. Quarterman, 551 U.S. 930, 947 (2007)). Second, the \nCourt has looked to \u201cAEDPA\u2019s own purposes\u201d: con-\nserving judicial resources, reducing piecemeal litiga-\ntion, and achieving finality \u201cwithin a reasonable \ntime.\u201d Id. (citing Panetti, 551 U.S. at 945\u201346). \nB. Factual and procedural background \nDanny Rivers has spent the last twelve years \nfighting to prove his innocence. Along the way, he \ndiscovered that exculpatory evidence had been sitting \nin his trial counsel\u2019s files all the while\u2014evidence that \nhis lawyers could have used to clear his name. If Riv-\ners is right, then he not only received ineffective as-\nsistance but was also wrongly convicted. This case is \nabout the procedural hurdles that Rivers must clear \nbefore a court will hear him out. \n\n7 \n \n \n1. Rivers is tried and convicted \nIn 2012, a Texas jury convicted Rivers of sexually \nabusing his children and possessing child pornogra-\nphy. He is currently serving a 38-year sentence. \na. This case began amidst a bitter divorce. In 2008, \na Texas judge awarded Rivers temporary custody of \nhis 9-year-old daughter. Rivers v. Lumpkin, No. 7:21-\ncv-00012 (N.D. Tex.), Dkt. 11-14 (\u201cR-1\u201d), at 156, 164. \nThe court also granted Rivers sole use of the family \nhome, ordered his ex-wife to pay child support, and \ndenied her request for alimony. Id. Dkt. 11-15 (\u201cR-2\u201d), \nat 15. In response, Rivers\u2019s ex-wife \u201cpunish[ed]\u201d him \nby \u201cnot letting him see\u201d his 12-year-old stepdaughter, \nwhom he had raised as his own. R-2, at 16. \nThe following year, with custody arrangements un-\nchanged, Rivers\u2019s ex-wife drove the children to the \npolice station while Rivers was away for work. Both \ngirls met with officers and accused Rivers of sexually \nabusing them. R-2, at 18, 129. Police then searched \nRivers\u2019s home, seized the family laptop, and launched \na monthslong forensic examination, eventually identi-\nfying \u201ctwo files of interest\u201d that \u201cappeared to be child \npornography.\u201d Id. at 26, 28; id. Dkt. 11-10 (\u201cR-3\u201d), at \n13, 31, 73; id. Dkt. 11-16, at 15, 66\u201367. \nb. A Wichita County, Texas grand jury indicted \nRivers for continuous sexual abuse, indecency with a \nchild, and two counts of possessing child pornogra-\nphy. R-3, at 8\u201315. Rivers, who had no prior criminal \nhistory, R-2, at 161, pleaded not guilty. \nWith his trial looming, Rivers moved to sever the \nchild-pornography counts, arguing that they might \ncolor the jury\u2019s views on the other charges. R-1, at 15. \nThe state opposed severance. Because its case had \n\u201cno DNA or physical evidence,\u201d Texas argued that the \n\n8 \n \n \nalleged child pornography was \u201cnecessary\u201d to estab-\nlish Rivers\u2019s \u201cmotive\u201d and \u201cattraction to young girls.\u201d \nId. at 14\u201315. The court refused to sever. Id. at 23. \nc. At trial, Rivers\u2019s daughter and stepdaughter al-\nleged a staggering pattern of sexual abuse. R-1, at \n142, 145\u2013146, 167\u2013168. They further claimed that \nRivers had shown them child pornography at least \nseventy times, testifying that he had \u201cdownloaded \nmultiple videos\u201d and played different films on differ-\nent occasions. Id. at 153, 172. Rivers\u2019s daughter also \naccused her father of secretly recording images in the \nshower. R-1, at 170. (No hidden cameras were ever \nfound.) All told, the girls alleged over 200 instances of \nshocking abuse, many of which reportedly took place \nin common areas of the home while their mother, un-\ncle, or cousin were also present in the house. R-1, at \n139, 147, 152\u201353, 156, 158, 166; R-2, at 12, 90. No \nother witnesses saw the alleged abuse, and no physi-\ncal evidence corroborated the story. R-2, at 34, 64. \nGiven the lack of supporting evidence, the alleged \nchild pornography was a key issue at trial. The prose-\ncution called multiple witnesses to testify about the \ntwo files\u2014a single image and a single video\u2014that \nRivers was charged with possessing. R-2, at 19, 28, \n44, 74, 84, 100. While the trial judge had granted a \ncontinuance so the defense could obtain its own fo-\nrensic experts, R-3, at 31, 40, counsel did not do so. \nR-2, at 112. Instead, the defense called only a single \nwitness, who testified that Rivers was out of town \nwhen the files were allegedly downloaded. R-2, at \n113\u2013114, 131. \nd. The jury convicted Rivers on all charges, Pet. \nApp. 2a. It rejected the prosecution\u2019s call for a 169-\nyear sentence, however, and recommended that the \ncourt sentence Rivers to 42 years instead. R-3, at \n\n9 \n \n \n213\u201314, 221\u201329. The court went lower still: 38 years \nbehind bars, all counts considered\u2014just three years \nabove the minimum. Pet. App. 13a. The Texas Court \nof Appeals affirmed. \n2. Rivers seeks postconviction relief \na. In 2013, Rivers began asking his lawyers to send \nhim his client file. He explained: \u201cI don\u2019t know what \nall it contains, but it looks like I\u2019m going to have to do \nthis thing pro se, so I need everything I can get.\u201d \nNo. 7:21-cv-00012 (N.D. Tex.) Dkt. 15-11, at 67. \nCounsel \u201cnever responded to [his] request,\u201d and two \nyears later, Rivers was still trying. Id. at 68\u201369. He \neventually resorted to filing a formal grievance with \nthe Texas state bar. \nMeanwhile, Rivers pressed forward with what rec-\nords he had. In 2016, he sought state postconviction \nrelief based on ineffective assistance, among other \ngrounds. Relevant here, he argued that his trial \ncounsel had failed to \u201cper\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Davis, 590 U.S. \n504, 509 (2020). After that, the stringent gatekeeping \nrequirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2) bar nearly all \nattempts to file a \u201csecond or successive habeas corpus \napplication.\u201d Here, petitioner sought to amend his in-\nitial habeas application while it was pending on ap-\npeal. The Fifth Circuit applied \u00a7 2244(b)(2) and re-\njected the amended filing. \nThe circuits are intractably split on whether \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies to such filings. The Fifth, Sixth, \nSeventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits hold \nthat \u00a7 2244(b)(2) categorically applies to all second-\nin-time habeas filings made after the district court \nenters final judgment. The Second Circuit disagrees, \napplying \u00a7 2244(b)(2) only after a petitioner exhausts \nappellate review of his initial petition. And the Third \nand Tenth Circuits exempt some second-in-time fil-\nings from \u00a7 2244(b)(2), depending on whether a pris-\noner prevails on his initial appeal (Third Circuit) or \nsatisfies a seven-factor test (Tenth Circuit). \nThe question presented is: \nWhether \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies (i) only to habeas fil-\nings made after a prisoner has exhausted appellate \nreview of his first petition, (ii) to all second-in-time \nhabeas filings after final judgment, or (iii) to some \nsecond-in-time filings, depending on a prisoner\u2019s suc-\ncess on appeal or ability to satisfy a seven-factor test. \n \n\nii \n \nRELATED PROCEEDINGS \nEx parte Rivers, WR-84,550-01 & 84,550-02 (Tex. \nCt.

Nine cir-\ncuits have split four ways over that question, and on-\nly this Court can resolve the conflict. \n1. This case is about the hurdles that a prisoner \nmust clear before a court will hear him out. Petitioner \nDanny Rivers sought habeas relief, arguing that his \ncounsel had failed to investigate his case and had \nshown up to trial drunk. The district court denied the \npetition, finding that Rivers couldn\u2019t explain what his \nlawyer should have done differently or why that \nwould have changed things. But the answer soon \nemerged. After fighting for years to obtain his coun-\nsel\u2019s records, Rivers finally received them while his \ninitial petition was up on appeal. Among the files, \nRivers found an exculpatory report suggesting that \nhe was wrongly convicted\u2014evidence that his lawyers \nnever once mentioned at trial.  \nNew evidence in hand, Rivers raced to court\u2014only \nto find the doors barred. Applying \u00a7 2244(b)(2), the \ndistrict court reasoned that it was \u201cwithout jurisdic-\ntion to entertain\u201d the new evidence because Rivers\u2019s \nfiling counted as a \u201csecond or successive\u201d petition. \nPet. App. 19a. (Never mind that his first petition was \nstill pending on appeal and would be for nearly a \nyear.) The Fifth Circuit affirmed, explaining that \u201cfil-\nings introduced after a final judgment that raise ha-\nbeas claims\u201d are \u201cdeemed successive.\u201d Pet. App. 10a. \n\n2 \n \n \n2. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision deepens a circuit con-\nflict over when \u00a7 2244(b)(2) kicks in. In the Second \nCircuit, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) doesn\u2019t apply until a prisoner \nhas exhausted appellate review of his initial habeas \npetition\u2014leaving district courts free to consider a fil-\ning like Rivers\u2019s. As then-Judge Sotomayor put it, \nthat approach guarantees \u201cone full opportunity to \nseek collateral review.\u201d Ching v. United States, 298 \nF.3d 174, 177 (2d Cir. 2002). But the Fifth Circuit ex-\npressly \u201cdecline[d] \u2026 to embrace\u201d that rule. Pet. App. \n10a. Instead, it joined the Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, \nNinth, and Eleventh Circuits in applying \u00a7 2244(b)(2) \nafter the district court enters final judgment. That \napproach effectively grants \u201cone full opportunity to \nseek collateral review in the district court.\u201d United \nStates v. Santarelli, 929 F.3d 95, 104 (3d Cir. 2019) \n(cleaned up). Meanwhile, the Third and Tenth Cir-\ncuits follow their own unique approaches, holding \nthat \u00a7 2244(b)(2) sometimes applies between final \njudgment and exhaustion and sometimes doesn\u2019t. \nThree circuits have already denied rehearing en banc, \nand the rest show no sign of rethinking their views. \nIn short: the circuits are intractably split, the con-\nflict won\u2019t disappear on its own, and this Court\u2019s \nguidance is badly needed. See Balbuena v. Sullivan, \n970 F.3d 1176, 1197, 1200 (9th Cir. 2020) (Fletcher, \nJ., concurring in the result) (\u201curg[ing] the Supreme \nCourt to recognize\u201d and \u201cresolve the conflict\u201d).  \n3. The decision below is also wrong. In Banister v. \nDavis, 590 U.S. 504 (2020), this Court explained that \nthe phrase \u201csecond or successive\u201d is a term of art that \ndoesn\u2019t simply refer to every second-in-time habeas \nfiling. Instead, the Court has looked to historical \npractice and statutory aims when determining \nwhether \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies. But the Fifth Circuit \n\n3 \n \n \ndidn\u2019t even cite Banister, let alone follow its guidance. \nHad it done so, the court would have realized that its \nrule doesn\u2019t square with history. Early courts analyz-\ning abuses of the writ treated appellate review\u2014not \nfinal judgment\u2014as the relevant inflection point. \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s approach will also frustrate \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2)\u2019s aims. At bottom, the question is not \nwhether prisoners like Rivers will try to bring new \nevidence to the courts\u2019 attention. (They will\u2014no mat-\nter what rule this Court adopts.) The question in-\nstead is which court will consider that evidence first. \nUnder the Second Circuit\u2019s approach, a filing like \nRivers\u2019s would have gone to the district court that \njust denied the initial petition: the single member of \nArticle III most familiar with the case. That judge \ncould then have weighed the new evidence and decid-\ned whether to issue an indicative ruling under Feder-\nal Rule of Civil Procedure 62.1. By contrast, the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s rule requires Rivers to ask a brand-new \nthree-judge panel for permission to ask the district \ncourt to consider whether or not to reach the merits. \nIt\u2019s hard to squeeze that rule from the statutory \ntext\u2014and harder still to attribute it to a Congress fo-\ncused on judicial economy, efficiency, and finality. \n4. The question presented is important, and this \ncase is an ideal vehicle. Until this Court weighs in, at \nleast some states and prisoners will be living under \nthe wrong rule, and those in the outstanding circuits \nwill have to guess which rule applies. The interests \non both sides are too critical to leave up to geograph-\nical chance. The split is also outcome-determinative \nhere: if Rivers were incarcerated in New York instead \nof Texas, courts would have considered the new evi-\ndence, giving him a meaningful path to relief. \nThe Court should grant review. \n\n4 \n \n \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe court of appeals\u2019 opinion is reported at 99 F.4th \n216 and is reproduced in the appendix to this petition \nat Pet. App. 1a\u201311a. The district court\u2019s opinion is \nunpublished but is available at 2021 WL 4319670 and \nis reproduced at Pet. App. 12a\u201317a. \nJURISDICTION \nThe Fifth Circuit issued its judgment on April 15, \n2024. Pet. App. 1a. This Court has jurisdiction under \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISION INVOLVED \nSection 2244(b)(2) of Title 28, U.S. Code, provides: \nA claim presented in a second or successive ha-\nbeas corpus application under section 2254 that \nwas not presented in a prior application shall be \ndismissed unless\u2014 \n(A) the applicant shows that the claim relies on \na new rule of constitutional law, made retroac-\ntive to cases on collateral review by the Su-\npreme Court, that was previously unavailable; \nor \n(B)(i) the factual predicate for the claim could \nnot have been discovered previously through \nthe exercise of due diligence; and \n(ii) the facts underlying the claim, if proven \nand viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, \nwould be sufficient to establish by clear and \nconvincing evidence that, but for constitutional \nerror, no reasonable factfinder would have \nfound the applicant guilty of the underlying of-\nfense. \n\n5 \n \n \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal background \n1. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty \nAct of 1996 creates a dual-track system for federal \nhabeas relief. One path is for first-time petitioners. \n\u201cUnder AEDPA, a state prisoner always gets one \nchance to bring a federal habeas challenge to his con-\nviction.\u201d Banister v. Davis, 590 U.S. 504, 509 (2020). \nThis path begins in the district court. If that court \ndenies relief, the prisoner may request a \u201ccertificate \nof appealability\u201d\u2014initially from the district court, \nand then from the court of appeals. See Gonzalez v. \nThaler, 565 U.S. 134, 140 & n.5 (2012). The path ends \nonly when the prisoner has exhausted the chance to \nappeal and seek certiorari. \nThe second path is \u201crockier.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at \n509. A prisoner who wants to file a \u201csecond or succes-\nsive \nhabeas \ncorpus \napplication,\u201d \n28 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2), must first ask the court of appeals for \n\u201can order authorizing the district court to consider \nthe application,\u201d id. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). The appellate \ncourt may oblige only if the prisoner makes a \u201cprima \nfacie showing,\u201d id. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(C), that the petition \n\u201crelies on a new and retroactive rule of constitutional \nlaw\u201d or \u201calleges previously undiscoverable facts that \nwould establish \u2026 innocence,\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at \n509 (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2)). If so, the petition \ngoes to the district court, which must decide for itself \nwhether the petition \u201csatisfies the requirements\u201d of \n\u00a7 2244. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(4). At the same time, be-\ncause any claim \u201cpresented in a prior application\u201d \nmust be dismissed, \u00a7 2244(b)(1), both courts must \ncarefully compare the new petition to all prior peti-\ntions to determine precisely what \u201cclaims\u201d the prison-\n\n6 \n \n \ner has brought. Only then\u2014after all that is done\u2014\nmay the district court reach the merits. \nThe upshot is that much rides on whether \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies\u2014that is: on whether a filing is \ndeemed \u201cpart and parcel of the first habeas proceed-\ning,\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 507, or instead a \u201csecond \nor successive habeas corpus application,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2).  \n2. The phrase \u201csecond or successive\u201d is a \u201cterm of \nart\u201d that does not refer simply to \u201call habeas filings \u2026 \nfollowing an initial application.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at \n511 (first quoting Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, \n486 (2000), then quoting Magwood, 561 U.S. at 332 \n(2010)). To determine when \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies, \u201cthis \nCourt has looked for guidance in two main places.\u201d \nId. at 512. First, the Court has considered history: \n\u201cwhether a type of later-in-time filing would have \nconstituted an abuse of the writ\u201d under the Court\u2019s  \n\u201cpre-AEDPA cases.\u201d Id. (cleaned up) (quoting Panetti \nv. Quarterman, 551 U.S. 930, 947 (2007)). Second, the \nCourt has looked to \u201cAEDPA\u2019s own purposes\u201d: con-\nserving judicial resources, reducing piecemeal litiga-\ntion, and achieving finality \u201cwithin a reasonable \ntime.\u201d Id. (citing Panetti, 551 U.S. at 945\u201346). \nB. Factual and procedural background \nDanny Rivers has spent the last twelve years \nfighting to prove his innocence. Along the way, he \ndiscovered that exculpatory evidence had been sitting \nin his trial counsel\u2019s files all the while\u2014evidence that \nhis lawyers could have used to clear his name. If Riv-\ners is right, then he not only received ineffective as-\nsistance but was also wrongly convicted. This case is \nabout the procedural hurdles that Rivers must clear \nbefore a court will hear him out. \n\n7 \n \n \n1. Rivers is tried and convicted \nIn 2012, a Texas jury convicted Rivers of sexually \nabusing his children and possessing child pornogra-\nphy. He is currently serving a 38-year sentence. \na. This case began amidst a bitter divorce. In 2008, \na Texas judge awarded Rivers temporary custody of \nhis 9-year-old daughter. Rivers v. Lumpkin, No. 7:21-\ncv-00012 (N.D. Tex.), Dkt. 11-14 (\u201cR-1\u201d), at 156, 164. \nThe court also granted Rivers sole use of the family \nhome, ordered his ex-wife to pay child support, and \ndenied her request for alimony. Id. Dkt. 11-15 (\u201cR-2\u201d), \nat 15. In response, Rivers\u2019s ex-wife \u201cpunish[ed]\u201d him \nby \u201cnot letting him see\u201d his 12-year-old stepdaughter, \nwhom he had raised as his own. R-2, at 16. \nThe following year, with custody arrangements un-\nchanged, Rivers\u2019s ex-wife drove the children to the \npolice station while Rivers was away for work. Both \ngirls met with officers and accused Rivers of sexually \nabusing them. R-2, at 18, 129. Police then searched \nRivers\u2019s home, seized the family laptop, and launched \na monthslong forensic examination, eventually identi-\nfying \u201ctwo files of interest\u201d that \u201cappeared to be child \npornography.\u201d Id. at 26, 28; id. Dkt. 11-10 (\u201cR-3\u201d), at \n13, 31, 73; id. Dkt. 11-16, at 15, 66\u201367. \nb. A Wichita County, Texas grand jury indicted \nRivers for continuous sexual abuse, indecency with a \nchild, and two counts of possessing child pornogra-\nphy. R-3, at 8\u201315. Rivers, who had no prior criminal \nhistory, R-2, at 161, pleaded not guilty. \nWith his trial looming, Rivers moved to sever the \nchild-pornography counts, arguing that they might \ncolor the jury\u2019s views on the other charges. R-1, at 15. \nThe state opposed severance. Because its case had \n\u201cno DNA or physical evidence,\u201d Texas argued that the \n\n8 \n \n \nalleged child pornography was \u201cnecessary\u201d to estab-\nlish Rivers\u2019s \u201cmotive\u201d and \u201cattraction to young girls.\u201d \nId. at 14\u201315. The court refused to sever. Id. at 23. \nc. At trial, Rivers\u2019s daughter and stepdaughter al-\nleged a staggering pattern of sexual abuse. R-1, at \n142, 145\u2013146, 167\u2013168. They further claimed that \nRivers had shown them child pornography at least \nseventy times, testifying that he had \u201cdownloaded \nmultiple videos\u201d and played different films on differ-\nent occasions. Id. at 153, 172. Rivers\u2019s daughter also \naccused her father of secretly recording images in the \nshower. R-1, at 170. (No hidden cameras were ever \nfound.) All told, the girls alleged over 200 instances of \nshocking abuse, many of which reportedly took place \nin common areas of the home while their mother, un-\ncle, or cousin were also present in the house. R-1, at \n139, 147, 152\u201353, 156, 158, 166; R-2, at 12, 90. No \nother witnesses saw the alleged abuse, and no physi-\ncal evidence corroborated the story. R-2, at 34, 64. \nGiven the lack of supporting evidence, the alleged \nchild pornography was a key issue at trial. The prose-\ncution called multiple witnesses to testify about the \ntwo files\u2014a single image and a single video\u2014that \nRivers was charged with possessing. R-2, at 19, 28, \n44, 74, 84, 100. While the trial judge had granted a \ncontinuance so the defense could obtain its own fo-\nrensic experts, R-3, at 31, 40, counsel did not do so. \nR-2, at 112. Instead, the defense called only a single \nwitness, who testified that Rivers was out of town \nwhen the files were allegedly downloaded. R-2, at \n113\u2013114, 131. \nd. The jury convicted Rivers on all charges, Pet. \nApp. 2a. It rejected the prosecution\u2019s call for a 169-\nyear sentence, however, and recommended that the \ncourt sentence Rivers to 42 years instead. R-3, at \n\n9 \n \n \n213\u201314, 221\u201329. The court went lower still: 38 years \nbehind bars, all counts considered\u2014just three years \nabove the minimum. Pet. App. 13a. The Texas Court \nof Appeals affirmed. \n2. Rivers seeks postconviction relief \na. In 2013, Rivers began asking his lawyers to send \nhim his client file. He explained: \u201cI don\u2019t know what \nall it contains, but it looks like I\u2019m going to have to do \nthis thing pro se, so I need everything I can get.\u201d \nNo. 7:21-cv-00012 (N.D. Tex.) Dkt. 15-11, at 67. \nCounsel \u201cnever responded to [his] request,\u201d and two \nyears later, Rivers was still trying. Id. at 68\u201369. He \neventually resorted to filing a formal grievance with \nthe Texas state bar. \nMeanwhile, Rivers pressed forward with what rec-\nords he had. In 2016, he sought state postconviction \nrelief based on ineffective assistance, among other \ngrounds. Relevant here, he argued that his trial \ncounsel had failed to \u201cperform an objectively reasona-\nble investigation\u201d or \u201cverify the ages of the persons\u201d \nin the alleged child pornography. No. 7:21-cv-00012 \n(N.D. Tex.), Dkt. 12-21, at 9. He added that his lead \ncounsel was \u201cinebriated\u201d at the trial. Id. at 11. \nThe Texas Court of Criminal Appeals found that \nRivers had \u201calleged facts that, if true, might entitle \nhim to relief.\u201d Ex parte Rivers, 2016 WL 5800277, at \n*1 (Tex. Crim. App. Oct. 5, 2016). It remanded for \nfurther factfinding, ordering the court to appoint \ncounsel if it \u201celect[ed] to hold a hearing.\u201d Id. Judge \nAlcala wrote separately to urge the appointment of \ncounsel \u201cregardless of whether the trial court holds a \nhearing.\u201d Id. (Alcala, J., concurring). \nOn remand, the trial court neither held a hearing \nnor appointed counsel. Instead, it chiefly relied on af-\n\n10 \n \n \nfidavits in which trial counsel defended their perfor-\nmance, denied any drunkenness, and claimed that \nRivers had \u201cadmitted to [them] that he engaged in \nsexual acts with the victims.\u201d Rivers v. Davis, 2018 \nWL 4443153, at *3 (N.D. Tex. July 27, 2018); see also \nNo. 7:17-cv-00124 (N.D. Tex.), Dkt. 24-1, at 24. Rivers \nresponded with his own affidavit, categorically \u201cde-\nny[ing] making such admissions.\u201d Id. at 2. He also \nsubmitted a text message from one of the lawyers\u2019 \nspouses, confirming that counsel \u201cshowed up intoxi-\ncated for court,\u201d id. at 25, and a news report showing \nthat his lead counsel was arrested six months before \nthe trial \u201cafter showing up at a woman[\u2019]s house na-\nked and drunk,\u201d id. at 33 (cleaned up) (quoting Tex-\noma, Local Attorney Sentenced to Two Years Proba-\ntion (Mar. 18, 2015), bit.ly/Barber-Arrest). The trial \ncourt nonetheless \u201cconcluded that counsel were not \nineffective,\u201d and the Court of Criminal Appeals af-\nfirmed. Ex parte Rivers, 2017 WL 3380491, at *1 \n(Tex. Crim. App. June 7, 2017). \nb. Rivers sought federal habeas relief in August \n2017, raising the same ineffective-assistance claims, \namong other grounds. No. 7:17-cv-00124 (N.D. Tex.), \nDkt. 1, at 6. The district court denied Rivers\u2019s habeas \npetition and declined to grant a certificate of appeal-\nability. Pet. App. 2a. Rivers then sought a certificate \nof appealability from the Fifth Circuit. \n3. While his habeas appeal is pending, \nRivers obtains exculpatory evidence \na. While his case was pending on appeal, Rivers fi-\nnally received the client file that he first requested in \n2013. Pet. App. 2a. In it, he found a state investiga-\ntor\u2019s report analyzing the two files underlying his \nchild-pornography conviction. The report called the \nvideo merely \u201cof interest,\u201d without further comment. \n\n11 \n \n \nMeanwhile, the image was labeled \u201cNOT CHILD \nPORN.\u201d No. 7:21-cv-00012 (N.D. Tex.), Dkt. 15-11, at \n75\u201377. The report also listed a number of other files \nfound on the family laptop. Next to one\u2014entitled  \n\u201creallyunderagekiddieporn\u201d\u2014the state investigator \nhad written: \u201calthough the title indicated it to be \nchild porn,\u201d it \u201cis not.\u201d Id. at 75. Another, whose title \nincluded phrases like \u201cpre-teen tiny children\u201d and \n\u201cincest sex porn underage,\u201d was also marked \u201cNOT \nCHILD PORN.\u201d Id. Most telling of all, these files \nand the video \u201cof interest\u201d were not saved under Riv-\ners\u2019s name; they were instead recovered from a down-\nload folder bearing the name of Rivers\u2019s ex-wife. \nAfter discovering the investigator\u2019s report, Rivers \nmoved to supplement the appellate record. See \nNo. 18-11490 (5th Cir.), Dkt. 27. He also filed an affi-\ndavit stating that he had never seen the report and \nnoting that his lawyers had \u201cfailed to raise this ex-\nculpatory evidence\u201d that had been \u201cin [their] posses-\nsion\u201d all along. Id. at 5, 10\u201311. The affidavit added \nthat Rivers\u2019s \u201cestranged wife had access to the house \nand did in fact enter the house, against court orders, \nwhile [Rivers] was out of town during the time frame \nthe alleged child porn was downloaded,\u201d id. at 7\u2014one \nexplanation for why the \u201cchild pornography\u201d ap-\npeared under her username, not his. \nThe Fifth Circuit denied Rivers\u2019s motion to supple-\nment the record but granted a certificate of appeala-\nbility for the ineffective-assistance claim. Id. Dkt. 34, \nat 2. Rivers later asked the court either to stay his \nappeal or to remand so he could seek relief in the dis-\ntrict court without creating \u201cpiecemeal litigation.\u201d Id. \nDkt. 61, at 5\u20136. The Fifth Circuit refused, id. Dkt. 78, \nand ultimately affirmed, see Rivers v. Lumpkin, 2022 \n\n12 \n \n \nWL 1517027 (5th Cir. May 13, 2022), cert. denied, 143 \nS. Ct. 1090 (2023). \nb. In February 2021, while his appeal was still \npending, Rivers used the standard \u00a7 2254 petition \ntemplate provided to pro se litigants to bring the new \nevidence to the district court\u2019s attention. No. 7:21-cv-\n00012 (N.D. Tex.), Dkt. 2, at 7. While the filing also \nraised several new claims, Rivers chiefly argued that \ntrial counsel\u2019s \u201cfail[ure] to present exculpatory evi-\ndence\u201d violated his right to effective assistance. Id. \nDkt. 10, at 24. \nThe same magistrate judge who reviewed Rivers\u2019s \ninitial habeas petition recommended that the new fil-\ning be deemed a \u201csecond or successive\u201d petition and \ntransferred to the Fifth Circuit for lack of jurisdic-\ntion. See Pet. App. 3a\u20134a. Rivers objected to the rec-\nommendation, No. 7:21-cv-00012 (N.D. Tex.), Dkt. 27, \nand \u201cmove[d] the court to consider an interlocutory \nreview,\u201d id. Dkt. 26, at 5. The district court adopted \nthe recommendation and denied Rivers\u2019s motion as \nmoot. See Pet. App. 18a\u201319a \nRivers appealed the transfer order, urging the court \nto construe the February 2021 filing as an amend-\nment to his initial petition, instead of a second or suc-\ncessive petition. Pet. App. 3a\u20134a. The Fifth Circuit \naffirmed. Id. at 1a\u20132a. It reasoned that \u00a7 2244(b)(2) \napplies to \u201cfilings introduced after a final judgment \nthat raise habeas claims, no matter how titled.\u201d Id. at \n10a. Here, the February 2021 filing was \u201csecond-in-\ntime\u201d and \u201cattack[ed] the same conviction that [Riv-\ners had] challenged\u201d in his initial habeas proceeding, \nso it counted as \u201csecond or successive.\u201d Id. at 6a. The \ncourt\u2019s opinion acknowledged that eight other circuits \nhad splintered on the question. Id. at 8a. \n\n13 \n \n \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \nThe courts of appeals are intractably split over \nwhether \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies to a habeas filing made \nafter the district court has denied an initial petition \nbut before an appellate court has weighed in. That \nquestion is critically important to states and prison-\ners alike, and it arises too often to leave up to geo-\ngraphical happenstance. The decision below is also \nwrong. It ignores this Court\u2019s guidance in Banister, \nflies in the face of historical practice, and frustrates\u2014\nrather than furthers\u2014AEDPA\u2019s aims. Finally, this \ncase is an ideal vehicle for the Court to offer much-\nneeded guidance. The issue is cleanly presented and \noutcome-determinative: only the Fifth Circuit\u2019s mis-\ntaken reading of \u00a7 2244(b)(2) stands between Rivers \nand a meaningful path to relief. The Court should \ngrant the petition. \nI. The courts of appeals are split four ways \nover what triggers \u00a7 2244(b)(2), and only \nthis Court can resolve the conflict. \nNine circuits have split four ways over the question \npresented. In the Second Circuit, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) does \nnot apply until the petitioner exhausts appellate re-\nview of his first habeas petition. The Fifth, Sixth, \nSeventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits disa-\ngree, holding that \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies as soon as, or \nshortly after, the district court enters final judgment. \n(Even they can\u2019t agree on the precise trigger.) Mean-\nwhile, the Tenth Circuit applies \u00a7 2244(b)(2) even \nearlier\u2014except when the petitioner satisfies a seven-\nfactor test. And in the Third Circuit, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) tog-\ngles on and off depending on whether the petitioner \nwins or loses on appeal. Respondent acknowledged \nthe split below, see No. 21-11031 (5th Cir.), Dkt. 52, \nat 15\u201324, and only this Court can resolve it.  \n\n14 \n \n \nA. In the Second Circuit, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) does \nnot apply until appellate review of the \nfirst habeas petition is exhausted.  \nIn Whab v. United States, the Second Circuit held \nthat \u00a7 2244(b)(2) does not apply while \u201cappellate pro-\nceedings following the district court\u2019s dismissal of the \ninitial petition remain pending.\u201d 408 F.3d 116, 118 \n(2d Cir. 2005).  \nUsama Whab filed a pro se habeas petition. Id. at \n117. The district court denied the petition and de-\nclined to issue a certificate of appealability. Id. at \n118. Whab then sought a certificate of appealability \nfrom the Second Circuit, which the court ultimately \ndenied. Id. While that motion was still pending, how-\never, Whab asked the Second Circuit for permission \nto file a \u201csecond or successive\u201d petition. Id. at 119. \nThe court held that Whab\u2019s \u201csubsequent petition \nwas not \u2018second or successive\u2019 within the meaning of\u201d \nAEDPA. Id. at 118. Citing then-Judge Sotomayor\u2019s \nrationale in Ching v. United States, it explained that \na petition can\u2019t be \u201csecond or successive\u201d unless it is \nfiled after \u201cthe conclusion of a proceeding that counts \nas the first.\u201d 298 F.3d at 177. And the first proceeding \nisn\u2019t over until the \u201copportunity to seek review in the \nSupreme Court has expired.\u201d Whab, 408 F.3d at 120. \nBecause Whab\u2019s first proceeding was still pending \nwhen he filed his subsequent petition, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) \ndid not apply. Id. at 119.  \nOf course, that doesn\u2019t mean that anything goes. \n\u201cTraditional doctrines, such as abuse of the writ, con-\ntinue to apply.\u201d Id. at 119 n.2. So even if a filing is \nnot \u201csecond or successive\u201d under \u00a7 2244(b)(2), prison-\ners do not get a \u201cfree pass\u201d to \u201cfile numerous petitions \nbefore an initially filed petition is finally adjudicated \n\n15 \n \n \non the merits.\u201d Id.; see also Ching, 298 F.3d at 179\u2013\n80 (\u201cCourts are not obliged to entertain needless or \npiecemeal litigation; nor should they adjudicate a mo-\ntion or petition whose purpose is to vex, harass, or \ndelay.\u201d) Neither can prisoners \u201cprevent the adjudica-\ntion of an initial habeas petition from ever becoming \nfinal by extending the first habeas proceedings \nthrough an infinite number of new petitions.\u201d Fuller \nv. United States, 815 F.3d 112, 113 (2d Cir. 2016). \nSection 2244(b)(2) kicks in \u201cwhen the time to file a \npetition for certiorari \u2026 expire[s]\u201d\u2014whether or not a \nfollow-up petition is still pending. Id. \nSince Whab, the Second Circuit has repeatedly re-\naffirmed this workable approach. E.g., Garcia v. Su-\nperintendent of Great Meadow Corr. Facility, 841 \nF.3d 581, 582 (2d Cir. 2016); Fuller, 815 F.3d at 113.  \nB. In the Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, \nNinth, and Eleventh Circuits, \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies when the district \ncourt enters final judgment or  \nshortly after. \nSix circuits have expressly rejected the Second Cir-\ncuit\u2019s approach, holding that \u00a7 2244(b)(2) is triggered \nat (or around) the time that the district court enters \nfinal judgment. Yet even these courts can\u2019t agree on \nexactly what triggers the statute. \n1. In the Fifth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Elev-\nenth Circuits, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies as soon as the dis-\ntrict court enters final judgment. \na. The Fifth Circuit below recognized the split and \n\u201cdecline[d] \u2026 to embrace\u201d the Second Circuit\u2019s rule, \nholding instead that \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies after the en-\ntry of final judgment. Pet. App. 10a\u201312a. \n\n16 \n \n \nThe district court denied Danny Rivers\u2019s pro se ha-\nbeas petition and entered final judgment. Pet. \nApp. 2a. The Fifth Circuit then granted a certificate \nof appealability as to Rivers\u2019s ineffective-assistance \nclaim. Id. While that appeal was pending, Rivers \nsought further relief in the district court. Applying \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2), the district court deemed Rivers\u2019s filing \na \u201csecond or successive\u201d petition, and the Fifth Cir-\ncuit affirmed. \nAccording to the Fifth Circuit, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) covers \n\u201cfilings introduced after a final judgment that raise \nhabeas claims.\u201d Pet. App. 10a. The court derived that \nrule from this Court\u2019s decision in Gonzalez v. Crosby, \n545 U.S. 524 (2005). The prisoner in Gonzalez \u201cdid \nnot file for rehearing or review\u201d in his first habeas \nproceeding and then sought Rule 60(b) relief a year \nlater. Id. at 527. This Court held that \u00a7 2244(b)(2) did \nnot apply because the prisoner\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion \ndid not raise habeas claims. The Fifth Circuit read \nGonzalez to stand for the \u201cunderlying principle\u201d that \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies after final judgment, lest prison-\ners use \u201cpost-judgment motions\u201d to evade AEDPA. \nBut see Balbuena, 970 F.3d at 1200 (Fletcher, J., con-\ncurring in the result) (\u201cGonzalez does not answer the \nquestion whether [a petition] is a \u2018second or succes-\nsive\u2019 habeas application under \u00a7 2244(b).\u201d). \nb. The Ninth Circuit also applies \u00a7 2244(b)(2) as \nsoon as the district court has \u201cadjudicated [a] habeas \npetition on the merits.\u201d Balbuena v. Sullivan, 980 \nF.3d 619, 642 (9th Cir. 2020).  \nWhile the denial of Alexander Balbuena\u2019s habeas \npetition was still pending on appeal, Balbuena sought \nadditional relief in the district court. Id. at 628, 639. \nThe district court deemed Balbuena\u2019s subsequent fil-\ning \u201can unauthorized second or successive petition,\u201d \n\n17 \n \n \nand the Ninth Circuit affirmed. Id. at 628. Citing cir-\ncuit precedent, it held that \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applied be-\ncause Balbuena \u201csought to add a new claim after the \ndistrict court denied his petition.\u201d Id. at 636\u201337. \nAlong the way, the Ninth Circuit expressly acknowl-\nedged\u2014and \u201cdecline[d] to follow\u201d\u2014the Second Cir-\ncuit\u2019s contrary approach. Id. at 637. \nJudge Fletcher wrote separately to \u201curge the Su-\npreme Court to recognize the circuit split and adopt\u201d \nthe Second Circuit\u2019s rule. Id. at 642 (Fletcher, J., con-\ncurring in the result). In his view, the Ninth Circuit \n\u201cmade a mistake\u201d both \u201cas a matter of ordinary lan-\nguage\u201d and \u201cas a practical matter.\u201d Id. at 644. As to \ntext, he reasoned that \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies \u201conly once \nan appeal has been finally adjudicated.\u201d Id. And as to \nconsequences, he explained that the Second Circuit\u2019s \nrule \u201cwill not result in a flood of late and procedurally \nabusive claims.\u201d Id. He closed by \u201cencourag[ing]\u201d this \nCourt to \u201cresolve the conflict in the circuits\u201d and ex-\npressing \u201coptimis[m]\u201d that it would \u201cagree with\u201d the \nSecond Circuit \u201crather than\u201d the Ninth. Id. at 645. \nc. The Seventh Circuit also holds that final judg-\nment triggers \u00a7 2244(b)(2). See Phillips v. United \nStates, 668 F.3d 433, 435\u201336 (7th Cir. 2012). While \nthe Seventh Circuit was reviewing his habeas denial, \nDavid Phillips asked the district court to consider \nnewly discovered evidence. Id. at 434. The district \ncourt denied that motion on the merits, but the Sev-\nenth Circuit approached things differently. It held \nthat the new filing was not \u201cproperly before the dis-\ntrict court\u201d in the first place because it was a second-\nor-successive petition. Id. That was so (reasoned the \ncourt) because \u201c[f]inal judgment marks a terminal \npoint,\u201d and \u201c[t]reating motions filed during appeal as \n\n18 \n \n \npart of the original application\u201d would undermine \nAEDPA\u2019s \u201ctime-and-number limits.\u201d Id. at 435. \nd. The Eighth Circuit follows a similar approach. \nSee Williams v. Norris, 461 F.3d 999 (8th Cir. 2006). \nAfter the district court denied Frank Williams\u2019s ha-\nbeas petition, it failed to enter a separate final judg-\nment. Id. at 1000\u201301. In the brief period before the \norder became final, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 58, Williams \nmoved to amend the judgment and sought relief from \nit. 461 F.3d at 1000\u201301. The district court denied \nboth motions as second-or-successive habeas peti-\ntions. Id. The Eighth Circuit affirmed, reasoning that \nthe district court had intended to \u201cdispose of Wil-\nliams\u2019s petition on the merits,\u201d so his later filings \nwere \n\u201cpostjudgment\u201d\u2014and \nthus \nsubject \nto \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2). Id. at 1002. \ne. The Eleventh Circuit also applies \u00a7 2244(b)(2) af-\nter final judgment. See United States v. Terrell, 141 \nF. App\u2019x 849, 851\u201352 (11th Cir. 2005). Shortly after \nGeorge Terrell asked the Eleventh Circuit to review \nthe denial of his initial habeas petition, he sought ad-\nditional habeas relief in the district court. Id. at 850\u2013\n51. The district court applied \u00a7 2244(b)(2), deeming \nhis motion an unauthorized second-or-successive ap-\nplication. Id. at 851. The Eleventh Circuit agreed, \nemphasizing that \u201cthe district court had already de-\nnied\u201d Terrell\u2019s initial habeas petition. Id. at 852.  \n2. The Sixth Circuit follows a slightly different rule, \ntying \u00a7 2244(b)(2) to the opportunity for appeal\u2014not \nthe entry of final judgment. \nSamuel Moreland\u2019s initial habeas petition was still \npending on appeal when Moreland sought further \nhabeas relief in the district court. Moreland v. Robin-\nson, 813 F.3d 315, 322 (6th Cir. 2016). The Sixth Cir-\n\n19 \n \n \ncuit deemed Moreland\u2019s filings \u201csecond or successive \nhabeas petitions.\u201d Id. at 319. But instead of pegging \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2) to the entry of final judgment, like the \nFifth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits, \nthe Sixth Circuit focused on the window for appeal. \nIn its view, a motion that \u201cseeks to raise habeas \nclaims\u201d is a \u201csecond or successive habeas petition\u201d \nwhen filed \u201cafter the petitioner has appealed the dis-\ntrict court\u2019s denial of his original habeas petition or \nafter the time for the petitioner to do so has expired.\u201d \nId. at 325. In other words, courts in the Sixth Circuit \nask whether \u201cthe district court has \u2026 lost jurisdiction \nof the original habeas petition.\u201d Jones v. Bradshaw, \n46 F.4th 459, 479\u201381 (6th Cir. 2022). This means that \na petitioner who would be out of luck in the other cir-\ncuits could get relief in the Sixth Circuit while the \nwindow to appeal is still open. \nC. In the Tenth Circuit, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies \nafter a first-in-time petition is filed, un-\nless the petitioner satisfies a seven-\nfactor test.  \nThe Tenth Circuit applies \u00a7 2244(b)(2) whenever a \nsecond-in-time petition raises \u201cseparate and distinct\u201d \nclaims\u2014even if the first-in-time petition is still pend-\ning before the district court. United States v. Espino-\nza-Saenz, 235 F.3d 501, 503, 505 (10th Cir. 2000). \nThat rule puts the Tenth Circuit at odds with not on-\nly the Second Circuit, see Ochoa v. Sirmons, 485 F.3d \n538, 540\u201341 (10th Cir. 2007) (\u201cdeclin[ing]\u201d to follow \nthe Second Circuit\u2019s rule), but also with other circuits \nthat allow amendments before final judgment, e.g., \nPhillips, 668 F.3d at 435.  \nBut petitioners in the Tenth Circuit can avoid this \notherwise strict rule when \u201cjustice\u201d demands. Doug-\nlas v. Workman, 560 F.3d 1156, 1190 (10th Cir. 2009). \n\n20 \n \n \nWhile the denial of his first habeas petition was \npending on appeal, Yancy Douglas asked the Tenth \nCircuit for permission to file a second application as-\nserting that prosecutors had concealed information \nabout a key witness. Id. at 1160, 1167\u201368. The Tenth \nCircuit acknowledged that, under Ochoa, it \u201cwould \nnot ordinarily permit a habeas petitioner to supple-\nment his habeas petition in this way.\u201d Id. at 1189. \nBut this was no ordinary case. Rather, based on \u201csev-\nen factors\u201d\u2014including that Douglas\u2019s initial habeas \npetition remained pending, that the new claim relat-\ned closely to his pending claims, the prosecutor\u2019s con-\nduct, that Douglas faced the death penalty, and dis-\nparity between Douglas and his codefendant\u2014the \ncourt decided to \u201cdeem\u201d the later petition \u201ca supple-\nment to the previously asserted\u201d petition, rather than \na second-or-successive petition. Id. at 1189\u201396. The \nupshot is that courts in the Tenth Circuit don\u2019t apply \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2) under circumstances when courts in the \nFifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Eleventh \nCircuits would have to. See also United States v. \nPickard, 396 F. App\u2019x 568, 572 (10th Cir. 2010). \nD. In the Third Circuit, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) toggles \non and off depending on who wins the \ninitial appeal.  \nFinally, the Third Circuit follows its own unique \nrule. It agrees with the Second Circuit that \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2) does not automatically apply to a \u201csubse-\nquent habeas petition\u201d filed before \u201cexhaustion of ap-\npellate remedies with respect to the denial of [the] \ninitial habeas petition.\u201d Santarelli, 929 F.3d at 104\u2013\n05. But prisoners in Delaware, New Jersey, and \nPennsylvania face a twist that those in Connecticut, \nNew York, and Vermont don\u2019t. When a prisoner in \nthe Third Circuit seeks further habeas relief while \n\n21 \n \n \nhis initial petition is pending on appeal, the applica-\nbility of \u00a7 2244(b)(2) depends on the outcome of that \nappeal. See id. at 104 n.5 (Even if a \u201csubsequent ha-\nbeas petition\u201d is \u201cnot \u2018second or successive\u2019 at the time \nof filing,\u201d it \u201ccould later be construed as a \u2018second or \nsuccessive\u2019 habeas petition.\u201d). \nHere\u2019s the Third Circuit\u2019s logic. While the first peti-\ntion is up on appeal, the petitioner has not had \u201cone \nfull opportunity to seek collateral review.\u201d Id. at 105 \n(citation omitted). So a subsequent petition filed dur-\ning that period should be \u201cconstrued as a motion to \namend\u201d the first petition. Id. at 105\u201306. That motion \nbelongs \u201cin the district court in the first instance.\u201d Id. \nat 106. Yet the district court lacks jurisdiction while \nthe appeal is pending, so the motion to amend must \nstay on ice. Id. Now for the twist. If the Third Circuit \n\u201cvacates or reverses \u2026 and remands the matter,\u201d the \ndistrict court \u201cwould again be vested with jurisdiction \nto consider\u201d the motion. Id. When that happens, \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2) doesn\u2019t apply. On the other hand, if the \nprisoner \u201cexhausts her appellate remedies to no \navail,\u201d she has \u201cexpended the \u2018one full opportunity to \nseek collateral review\u2019 that AEDPA ensures.\u201d Id. (ci-\ntation omitted). In that case, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) does apply \nand\u2014presto!\u2014the \u201cmotion to amend\u201d becomes a \u201csec-\nond or successive\u201d habeas petition. Id. \n*     *     * \nOnly this Court can \u201cresolve the conflict in the cir-\ncuits,\u201d Balbuena, 980 F.3d at 642 (Fletcher, J., con-\ncurring in the result), and there is no reason to wait. \nThree circuits have already denied rehearing en \nbanc\u2014and one of them has done so twice. See Order, \nPhillips v. United States, Nos. 10-2154 & 11-1498 \n(7th Cir. Feb. 21, 2012); Order, Williams v. Norris, \nNo. 04-3485 (8th Cir. Jan. 11, 2007); Order, Balbuena \n\n22 \n \n \nv. Sullivan, Nos. 12-16414, 18-15432 (9th Cir. Nov. \n17, 2020); Order, Jacobs v. Thornell, No. 22-16822 \n(9th Cir. Apr. 9, 2024). The others show no sign of re-\nthinking their positions. Nor is there any need for \nmore percolation. The nine circuits that have already \nweighed in cover roughly 88% of all federal and state \nprisoners. See Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Statistics, \nbit.ly/Federal-Prisons; Prison Pol\u2019y Initiative, Appen-\ndix: State and Federal Prison Populations 2019-2023, \nbit.ly/State-Prisons. All positions are staked out, and \nthis Court now has the benefit of numerous opinions \non the issue. The Court should grant review. \nII. The question presented is critically im-\nportant and recurring. \nA. The question presented is too important to punt. \nSince 1996, AEDPA cases have become a fixture of \nthis Court\u2019s docket. In fact, the Court has repeatedly \ngranted cert to resolve conflicts over this very provi-\nsion. See, e.g., Banister, 590 U.S. at 511 (5-3 split); \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. 524 (2005); Slack v. McDaniel, \n529 U.S. 473 (2000) (3-4 split); Stewart v. Martinez-\nVillareal, 523 U.S. 637, 641 (1998) (1-1 split). That \nalone suggests certworthiness\u2014even apart from the \nfact that this split is deeper than those. \nThe issue is also critically important to parties on \nboth sides. Until this Court weighs in, at least some \nstates and prisoners will be living under the wrong \nrule, and those in the outstanding circuits will have \nto guess which rule applies. For states, that uncer-\ntainty turns AEDPA\u2019s promise of \u201cfinality\u201d on its \nhead. Banister, 590 U.S. at 512. But the stakes are \neven higher for prisoners. Cf. Boumediene v. Bush, \n553 U.S. 723, 739 (2008) (calling habeas \u201cone of the \nfew safeguards of liberty specified in a Constitution \nthat, at the outset, had no Bill of Rights\u201d). \u201cFederal \n\n23 \n \n \npostconviction law is complex, and few prisoners un-\nderstand it well.\u201d Curry v. United States, 507 F.3d \n603, 604 (7th Cir. 2007). So the last thing they need \nwhen seeking to navigate AEDPA\u2019s procedural thick-\net is uncertainty over which thicket they are in. \nB. The need for review is all the more pressing be-\ncause this issue arises so often. Two circuits have \nconfronted the question presented in the last four \nmonths. See Pet. App. 1a; Jacobs v. Thornell, 2024 \nWL 810443 (9th Cir. Feb. 27, 2024). But that\u2019s noth-\ning compared to the district courts. See, e.g., Daly v. \nOliver, 2024 WL 2092997, at *3 (E.D. Pa. May 9, \n2024), appeal docketed, No. 24-2070 (3d Cir. June 18, \n2024); Herrera v. United States, 2024 WL 218964, at \n*1 (N.D. Tex. Jan. 19, 2024); Hernandez v. Macomber, \n2023 WL 2992172, at *3 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 17, 2023); \nThomas v. Sec\u2019y, Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., 2023 WL \n2837521, at *9\u201311 (M.D. Fla. Apr. 7, 2023); Bollinger \nv. Gittere, 2023 WL 2242444, at *1\u20133 (D. Nev. Feb. \n24, 2023), appeal docketed, No. 23-99002 (9th Cir. \nMarch. 28, 2023); Perpall v. United States, 2023 WL \n2016836, at *1\u20132 (S.D. Fla. Feb. 15, 2023) (acknowl-\nedging the split); Atkins v. United States, 2023 WL \n1765536, at *3 (S.D. Fla. Feb. 3, 2023) (same).  \nAnd those are just (some of) the cases available on \nWestlaw. The federal courts received over 14,000 ha-\nbeas petitions last year. See U.S. Courts, Civil Statis-\ntical Tables For the Federal Judiciary (Dec. 31, 2023), \nbit.ly/2023-Statistics. Since one in ten habeas cases \ninvolves an amended petition, see N. King, et al., Fi-\nnal Technical Report: Habeas Litigation in U.S. Dis-\ntrict Courts 34 (2007), bit.ly/Habeas-Report, the real \nnumbers are likely far higher. Cf. Rachel Brown, et \nal., Is Unpublished Unequal? An Empirical Examina-\ntion of the 87% Nonpublication Rate in Federal Ap-\n\n24 \n \n \npeals, 107 Cornell L. Rev. 1, 62 (2021) (finding that \npro se, non-capital habeas cases are \u201cpublished at less \nthan one-third of the overall rate\u201d). \nIII. The decision below is wrong. \nThe Fifth Circuit thought that \u00a7 2244(b)(2) required \nthe district court to dismiss \u201cfor lack of jurisdiction\u201d \nbecause Rivers\u2019s 2021 filing was \u201cintroduced after a \nfinal judgment\u201d and \u201craise[d] habeas claims.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 10a\u201311a. That is wrong. Banister showed how \ncourts should determine \u201cwhat qualifies as second or \nsuccessive,\u201d 590 U.S. at 512, and its logic favors Riv-\ners here. But the Fifth Circuit didn\u2019t even cite Banis-\nter\u2014let alone engage in the proper analysis\u2014and its \nrule doesn\u2019t square with this Court\u2019s holdings either.    \nA. Section 2244(b)(2) does not apply until \nappellate review of the first habeas ap-\nplication is exhausted. \nThe phrase \u201csecond or successive application\u201d is a \n\u201cterm of art\u201d that is \u201cnot self-defining.\u201d Banister, 590 \nU.S. at 511 (quoting Slack, 529 U.S. at 486). To de-\ntermine when \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies, \u201cthis Court has \nlooked for guidance in two main places.\u201d Id. at 512. \nFirst, history: \u201cwhether a type of later-in-time filing \nwould have constituted an abuse of the writ, as that \nconcept is explained\u201d in this Court\u2019s \u201cpre-AEDPA cas-\nes.\u201d Id. (cleaned up) (quoting Panetti, 551 U.S. at \n947). Second, \u201cAEDPA\u2019s own purposes\u201d: conserving \njudicial resources, reducing piecemeal litigation, and \nachieving finality \u201cwithin a reasonable time.\u201d Id. (cit-\ning Panetti, 551 U.S. at 945\u201346). Here, both factors \nalign. Early courts applied abuse-of-the-writ rules in \nlight of appellate review, not final judgment, and ap-\nplying \u00a7 2244(b)(2) to filings like Rivers\u2019s would frus-\ntrate, not further, AEDPA\u2019s aims. \n\n25 \n \n \n1. Courts historically analyzed abuses of \nthe writ by reference to appellate re-\nview, not final judgment. \nThe abuse-of-the-writ doctrine was a nineteenth-\ncentury innovation. \u201c[B]y the common law of Eng-\nland, as it stood at the adoption of the constitution,\u201d \nthe denial of habeas relief was \u201cno bar to the issuing \nof a second or third or more writs, by any other court \nor magistrate having jurisdiction of the case.\u201d Ex \nparte Kaine, 14 F. Cas. 78, 80 (C.C.S.D.N.Y. 1853). \nInstead, \u201ccourts and judges were accustomed to exer-\ncise an independent judgment on each successive ap-\nplication, regardless of the number.\u201d Salinger v. \nLoisel, 265 U.S. 224, 231 (1924). Only later, once \u201ca \nright to an appellate review was given,\u201d did American \ncourts pare back this practice. Id. When they did, \nthey tied abuse-of-the-writ rules to the completion of \nappellate review\u2014not the entry of final judgment.  \nEx parte Cuddy, one of the earliest abuse-of-the-\nwrit cases, is a good example. 40 F. 62, 66 (C.C.S.D. \nCal. 1889) (Field, J.). A district court denied Thomas \nCuddy\u2019s habeas petition, and this Court affirmed. Id. \nat 63 (citing Ex parte Cuddy, 131 U.S. 280 (1889)). \nCuddy then sought habeas relief from Justice Field, \nriding circuit. Justice Field ordered the writ dis-\nmissed, reasoning that \u201ca second application upon the \nsame facts \u2026 should not be heard,\u201d absent \u201cleave to \nmake a new application.\u201d Id. at 66.  \nAlong the way, Justice Field emphasized two \nthings. First, \u201caction \u2026 on the second application\u201d \nshould turn on the \u201ccharacter of the court or officer to \nwhom the first application was made, and the full-\nness of the consideration given to it.\u201d Id. In Cuddy, \nfor example, Justice Field rejected the petition be-\ncause the prisoner sought further relief \u201cafter invok-\n\n26 \n \n \ning the judgment of the appellate court\u201d and \u201cfailing \ntherein.\u201d Id. at 64. In other words: the abuse-of-the-\nwrit doctrine applied after this Court weighed in\u2014\nnot after the district court entered final judgment. In \nfact, had the prisoner not \u201cappealed from the refusal \nof the district court,\u201d he could have \u201capplied to the \ncircuit judge\u201d for the same relief. Id. at 66. Second, \nJustice Field \u201crefer[red], of course,\u201d only to \u201ccases \nwhere a second application is made upon the same \nfacts presented, or which might have been presented\u201d \nin the initial application. Id. In his view, things \nwould be \u201centirely different\u201d if \u201csubsequent occurring \nevents\u201d offered \u201cnew\u201d grounds for consideration. Id. \nThis Court\u2019s abuse-of-the-writ cases followed the \nsame approach. Take Salinger, 265 U.S. at 230\u201332, \nwhich involved a serial habeas petitioner. Citing \nCuddy, the Court explained that an appellate court\u2019s \n\u201cprior refusal\u201d to grant a \u201clike application\u201d carries \nweight \u201cwhen a later application is being considered.\u201d \nId. at 230\u201331. Since the \u201cprior refusal\u201d in Salinger \nwas \u201caffirmed in a considered opinion by a Circuit \nCourt of Appeals,\u201d with \u201cno attempt to obtain\u201d further \nreview, an abuse-of-the-writ dismissal \u201cwould have \nbeen well exercised.\u201d Id. at 226\u201327, 232. Here again, \nwhat mattered was that an appellate court had \nweighed in\u2014not that a district court had denied the \nfirst petition and entered final judgment. \nAll of that boils down to this. When early courts \napplied abuse-of-the-writ rules, they asked whether \nan appellate decisionmaker had spoken\u2014not whether \na district court had entered final judgment. That \nmakes sense, since this Court has long understood \n\u201cproceedings in the appellate tribunal\u201d to be part of \nthe \u201cprocess of law\u201d by which prisoners test the legal-\nity of confinement. Frank v. Mangum, 237 U.S. 309, \n\n27 \n \n \n327 (1915) (discussing appellate review of conviction). \nAgainst that backdrop, a rule that treats final judg-\nment as the relevant inflection point is \u201cbad wine of \nrecent vintage.\u201d Rotkiske v. Klemm, 589 U.S. 8, 14 \n(2019) (citing TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U.S. 19, 37 \n(2001) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment)). \n2. Treating filings like Rivers\u2019s as \u201csec-\nond or successive\u201d would frustrate \nAEDPA\u2019s aims. \nBanister\u2019s other source of guidance\u2014\u201cAEDPA\u2019s own \npurposes\u201d\u2014points the same way. 590 U.S. at 512. \nTreating filings like Rivers\u2019s as \u201csecond or successive\u201d \nwould have baleful \u201cimplications for habeas practice,\u201d \nmaking it unlikely that \u201cCongress would have viewed \n[them] as successive.\u201d Id. at 512\u201313. \na. Judicial resources. So far as the lower courts \nare concerned, the question is not whether prisoners \nlike Rivers will seek further relief while their initial \npetitions are on appeal. The question instead is which \ncourt will review those filings first. Everyone agrees \nthat \u201ca three-judge panel of the court of appeals\u201d is \nthe first port of call for petitions filed after a prisoner \nexhausts appellate review of his initial application. \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(B). But Congress had little \nreason to channel filings like Rivers\u2019s down that \npath\u2014and good reason to treat them as part and par-\ncel of the initial habeas application. \ni. If section 2244(b)(2) is a \u201crock[y]\u201d path for prison-\ners, that goes double for courts. Banister, 590 U.S. at \n509. When the court of appeals receives a \u201csecond or \nsuccessive\u201d petition, three appellate judges have to \ndecide\u2014from square zero, and often without adver-\nsarial briefing\u2014whether the new evidence could have \nbeen \u201cdiscovered previously through the exercise of \n\n28 \n \n \ndue diligence.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(B)(i). Then they \nhave to examine \u201cthe evidence as a whole\u201d and de-\ntermine whether \u201cthe facts underlying the claim, if \nproven,\u201d would be \u201csufficient to establish by clear and \nconvincing evidence\u201d that \u201cno reasonable factfinder\u201d \nwould have convicted but for constitutional error. Id. \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2)(B)(ii). That, in turn, means considering \nthe state\u2019s \u201ctheory of the case,\u201d the evidence \u201csup-\nport[ing]\u201d that theory, and the counterfactual effect of \nthe \u201cnewly-discovered evidence,\u201d including how it \nwould have undermined the state\u2019s evidence and in-\nfluenced the theories\u2014and even \u201calternative theo-\nries\u201d\u2014that both sides could have \u201coffered the jury.\u201d \nMunchinski v. Wilson, 694 F.3d 308, 335\u201337 (3d Cir. \n2012). One recent authorization case was pending be-\nfore the Fifth Circuit for almost three years, and the \nopinion features a two-column, sixteen-row chart that \nspans three pages of the Federal Reporter. See In re \nWill, 970 F.3d 536, 544\u201346 (5th Cir. 2020). And that\u2019s \njust the first step. Even when the appellate court au-\nthorizes a \u201csecond or successive\u201d petition, the district \ncourt must still \u201cconduct its own thorough review\u201d to \nensure \u201cthe requirements of \u00a7 2244(b)(2) have been \nsatisfied.\u201d Id. at 543 (citation and quotation marks \nomitted). Still more: because any claim \u201cpresented in \na prior application\u201d must be dismissed, \u00a7 2244(b)(1), \nboth courts must carefully compare the \u201csecond or \nsuccessive\u201d petition to all prior petitions and deter-\nmine precisely what \u201cclaim[s]\u201d have been brought. Id. \nat 541. That can be especially challenging when the \ncourts confront an \u201cinartistically drawn [pro se] peti-\ntion,\u201d Price v. Johnston, 334 U.S. 266, 292 (1948).  \nii. Now consider the alternative. When Rivers \nsought further relief in February 2021, he went be-\nfore the same magistrate judge and district court \njudge who denied his initial petition. Had those judg-\n\n29 \n \n \nes reached the merits, they\u2014better than anyone\u2014\nwould have known whether his new evidence was \nworth the candle. If not: game over. If so, the court \ncould have issued an indicative ruling under Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 62.1. E.g., Parry v. Kerestes, \n2013 WL 6002358 (W.D. Pa. Nov. 12, 2013). Either \nway, a judge \u201cfamiliar with a habeas applicant\u2019s \nclaims\u201d would likely make \u201cquick work\u201d of a filing like \nthis. Banister, 590 U.S. at 517. That\u2019s good reason to \nthink that a Congress concerned about judicial re-\nsources \u201cwould have viewed\u201d such filings as \u201cpart and \nparcel of the first habeas proceeding.\u201d Id. at 507, 513.  \nb. Reducing piecemeal litigation. The latter \npath would serve AEDPA\u2019s second aim too\u2014and this \ncase is Exhibit A. New evidence in hand, Rivers \nasked the Fifth Circuit to remand so that he could \nseek relief on \u201call [his] claims rather than revisiting \nthis case in piecemeal litigation.\u201d No. 18-11490 (5th \nCir.) Dkt. 61, at 5\u20136. When that failed, he asked the \ndistrict court to \u201cconsider an interlocutory review\u201d to \n\u201cprevent unnecessary litigation and to preserve judi-\ncial resources.\u201d No. 7:21-cv-00012 (N.D. Tex.), Dkt. \n26, at 5. Instead, the court transferred the matter to \nthe Fifth Circuit, which opened a brand new proceed-\ning, where Rivers must convince three judges to au-\nthorize a fourth judge to consider whether or not to \nconsider the new evidence. \nc. Finality. Finality cuts the same way. Suppose \nthat the state investigator\u2019s report that Rivers dis-\ncovered in his client file isn\u2019t the bombshell that Riv-\ners reckons. In that case, the way to \u201clend[] finality\u201d \nto Rivers\u2019s conviction \u201cwithin a reasonable time\u201d \nwould have been for the district court to say so in \nSeptember 2021. Banister, 590 U.S. at 512. Had it \ndone that, this case would be over. Instead, the lower \n\n30 \n \n \ncourts sent Rivers and Texas down a path that could \nprolong this case\u2014and leave the validity of Rivers\u2019s \nconviction up in the air\u2014for years to come. \n* \n* \n* \nHad Congress wanted all post-judgment habeas fil-\nings to count as second or successive petitions, \u201cit eas-\nily could have written\u201d such a law. Ali v. Fed. Bureau \nof Prisons, 552 U.S. 214, 227 (2008). But it\u2019s hard to \nsqueeze that rule from the text of \u00a7 2244(b)(2) and the \nhistory against which it was written. And it\u2019s even \nharder to attribute the consequences to a Congress \nfocused on judicial resources, efficiency, and finality. \nSee N.Y. State Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs. v. Dublino, 413 \nU.S. 405, 419\u201320 (1973) (\u201cWe cannot interpret federal \nstatute to negate their own stated purposes.\u201d).  \nB. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision cannot be \nsquared with this Court\u2019s cases. \nThe Fifth Circuit addressed none of this. It did not \nask whether Rivers\u2019s filing \u201cwould have constituted \nan abuse of the writ, as that concept is explained in \n[this Court\u2019s] pre-AEDPA cases.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. \nat 512 (cleaned up) (quoting Panetti, 551 U.S. at 947). \nIt did not explain how its approach would \u201cconserv[e] \njudicial resources\u201d or \u201cstreamlin[e] habeas cases.\u201d Id. \nat 515, 517. And while it offered vague generalities \nabout evading AEDPA\u2019s limitations, it said not a \nword about finality, let alone whether its rule would \nhasten or hinder that objective here. In fact, the court \ndidn\u2019t even cite Banister\u2014even through both parties \nrelied on that case in their briefs. \nNor does the Fifth Circuit\u2019s approach square with \nthis Court\u2019s holdings. Gregory Banister\u2019s Rule 59(e) \nmotion came \u201cafter a final judgment\u201d and raised \u201cha-\nbeas claims,\u201d Pet. App. 10a, but this Court still held \n\n31 \n \n \nthat it was \u201cpart and parcel of the first habeas pro-\nceeding,\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 507. Likewise, the \nprisoner in Slack filed a post-final-judgment habeas \npetition, and this Court allowed that to proceed too. \nSlack, 529 U.S. at 487. And the same was true in \nStewart, where the prisoner\u2019s post-final-judgment \nhabeas application \u201cwas not a \u2018second or successive\u2019 \npetition\u2019 under \u00a7 2244(b).\u201d 523 U.S. at 643\u201345. \nIV. This case is an excellent vehicle. \nThis case is an ideal vehicle to finish what Banister \nstarted. The question presented raises a pure legal \nissue that was fully briefed and squarely decided be-\nlow. There are no preservation problems, alternative \nholdings, or factual disputes that would frustrate re-\nview. And the split is outcome-determinative. The \nFifth Circuit declined to consider Rivers\u2019s new evi-\ndence because it thought \u00a7 2244(b)(2) required that \nresult. Yet if Rivers were held in Buffalo, New York, \ninstead of Beeville, Texas, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) would have \nbeen no barrier, and the lower courts could have \nreached the merits. In other words, if this Court re-\nverses and adopts the Second Circuit\u2019s rule, Rivers \nwill have a meaningful path to relief. The lower \ncourts denied Rivers\u2019s initial petition largely because \nhe could not pinpoint what his counsel should have \ndone differently or how that might have changed \nthings. See Rivers, 2018 WL 4443153, at *4. But the \nnew evidence puts those questions to rest. Now all \nthat stands between Rivers and a fighting chance is \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s mistaken reading of \u00a7 2244(b)(2).  \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should grant the petition. \n \n\n32 \n \n \nRespectfully submitted,  \n \n \nPeter A.

Davis, 590 U.S. \n504, 509 (2020). After that, the stringent gatekeeping \nrequirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2) bar nearly all \nattempts to file a \u201csecond or successive habeas corpus \napplication.\u201d Here, petitioner sought to amend his in-\nitial habeas application while it was pending on ap-\npeal. The Fifth Circuit applied \u00a7 2244(b)(2) and re-\njected the amended filing. \nThe circuits are intractably split on whether \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies to such filings. The Fifth, Sixth, \nSeventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits hold \nthat \u00a7 2244(b)(2) categorically applies to all second-\nin-time habeas filings made after the district court \nenters final judgment. The Second Circuit disagrees, \napplying \u00a7 2244(b)(2) only after a petitioner exhausts \nappellate review of his initial petition. And the Third \nand Tenth Circuits exempt some second-in-time fil-\nings from \u00a7 2244(b)(2), depending on whether a pris-\noner prevails on his initial appeal (Third Circuit) or \nsatisfies a seven-factor test (Tenth Circuit). \nThe question presented is: \nWhether \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies (i) only to habeas fil-\nings made after a prisoner has exhausted appellate \nreview of his first petition, (ii) to all second-in-time \nhabeas filings after final judgment, or (iii) to some \nsecond-in-time filings, depending on a prisoner\u2019s suc-\ncess on appeal or ability to satisfy a seven-factor test. \n \n\nii \n \nRELATED PROCEEDINGS \nEx parte Rivers, WR-84,550-01 & 84,550-02 (Tex. \nCt.

Nine cir-\ncuits have split four ways over that question, and on-\nly this Court can resolve the conflict. \n1. This case is about the hurdles that a prisoner \nmust clear before a court will hear him out. Petitioner \nDanny Rivers sought habeas relief, arguing that his \ncounsel had failed to investigate his case and had \nshown up to trial drunk. The district court denied the \npetition, finding that Rivers couldn\u2019t explain what his \nlawyer should have done differently or why that \nwould have changed things. But the answer soon \nemerged. After fighting for years to obtain his coun-\nsel\u2019s records, Rivers finally received them while his \ninitial petition was up on appeal. Among the files, \nRivers found an exculpatory report suggesting that \nhe was wrongly convicted\u2014evidence that his lawyers \nnever once mentioned at trial.  \nNew evidence in hand, Rivers raced to court\u2014only \nto find the doors barred. Applying \u00a7 2244(b)(2), the \ndistrict court reasoned that it was \u201cwithout jurisdic-\ntion to entertain\u201d the new evidence because Rivers\u2019s \nfiling counted as a \u201csecond or successive\u201d petition. \nPet. App. 19a. (Never mind that his first petition was \nstill pending on appeal and would be for nearly a \nyear.) The Fifth Circuit affirmed, explaining that \u201cfil-\nings introduced after a final judgment that raise ha-\nbeas claims\u201d are \u201cdeemed successive.\u201d Pet. App. 10a. \n\n2 \n \n \n2. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision deepens a circuit con-\nflict over when \u00a7 2244(b)(2) kicks in. In the Second \nCircuit, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) doesn\u2019t apply until a prisoner \nhas exhausted appellate review of his initial habeas \npetition\u2014leaving district courts free to consider a fil-\ning like Rivers\u2019s. As then-Judge Sotomayor put it, \nthat approach guarantees \u201cone full opportunity to \nseek collateral review.\u201d Ching v. United States, 298 \nF.3d 174, 177 (2d Cir. 2002). But the Fifth Circuit ex-\npressly \u201cdecline[d] \u2026 to embrace\u201d that rule. Pet. App. \n10a. Instead, it joined the Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, \nNinth, and Eleventh Circuits in applying \u00a7 2244(b)(2) \nafter the district court enters final judgment. That \napproach effectively grants \u201cone full opportunity to \nseek collateral review in the district court.\u201d United \nStates v. Santarelli, 929 F.3d 95, 104 (3d Cir. 2019) \n(cleaned up). Meanwhile, the Third and Tenth Cir-\ncuits follow their own unique approaches, holding \nthat \u00a7 2244(b)(2) sometimes applies between final \njudgment and exhaustion and sometimes doesn\u2019t. \nThree circuits have already denied rehearing en banc, \nand the rest show no sign of rethinking their views. \nIn short: the circuits are intractably split, the con-\nflict won\u2019t disappear on its own, and this Court\u2019s \nguidance is badly needed. See Balbuena v. Sullivan, \n970 F.3d 1176, 1197, 1200 (9th Cir. 2020) (Fletcher, \nJ., concurring in the result) (\u201curg[ing] the Supreme \nCourt to recognize\u201d and \u201cresolve the conflict\u201d).  \n3. The decision below is also wrong. In Banister v. \nDavis, 590 U.S. 504 (2020), this Court explained that \nthe phrase \u201csecond or successive\u201d is a term of art that \ndoesn\u2019t simply refer to every second-in-time habeas \nfiling. Instead, the Court has looked to historical \npractice and statutory aims when determining \nwhether \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies. But the Fifth Circuit \n\n3 \n \n \ndidn\u2019t even cite Banister, let alone follow its guidance. \nHad it done so, the court would have realized that its \nrule doesn\u2019t square with history. Early courts analyz-\ning abuses of the writ treated appellate review\u2014not \nfinal judgment\u2014as the relevant inflection point. \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s approach will also frustrate \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2)\u2019s aims. At bottom, the question is not \nwhether prisoners like Rivers will try to bring new \nevidence to the courts\u2019 attention. (They will\u2014no mat-\nter what rule this Court adopts.) The question in-\nstead is which court will consider that evidence first. \nUnder the Second Circuit\u2019s approach, a filing like \nRivers\u2019s would have gone to the district court that \njust denied the initial petition: the single member of \nArticle III most familiar with the case. That judge \ncould then have weighed the new evidence and decid-\ned whether to issue an indicative ruling under Feder-\nal Rule of Civil Procedure 62.1. By contrast, the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s rule requires Rivers to ask a brand-new \nthree-judge panel for permission to ask the district \ncourt to consider whether or not to reach the merits. \nIt\u2019s hard to squeeze that rule from the statutory \ntext\u2014and harder still to attribute it to a Congress fo-\ncused on judicial economy, efficiency, and finality. \n4. The question presented is important, and this \ncase is an ideal vehicle. Until this Court weighs in, at \nleast some states and prisoners will be living under \nthe wrong rule, and those in the outstanding circuits \nwill have to guess which rule applies. The interests \non both sides are too critical to leave up to geograph-\nical chance. The split is also outcome-determinative \nhere: if Rivers were incarcerated in New York instead \nof Texas, courts would have considered the new evi-\ndence, giving him a meaningful path to relief. \nThe Court should grant review. \n\n4 \n \n \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe court of appeals\u2019 opinion is reported at 99 F.4th \n216 and is reproduced in the appendix to this petition \nat Pet. App. 1a\u201311a. The district court\u2019s opinion is \nunpublished but is available at 2021 WL 4319670 and \nis reproduced at Pet. App. 12a\u201317a. \nJURISDICTION \nThe Fifth Circuit issued its judgment on April 15, \n2024. Pet. App. 1a. This Court has jurisdiction under \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISION INVOLVED \nSection 2244(b)(2) of Title 28, U.S. Code, provides: \nA claim presented in a second or successive ha-\nbeas corpus application under section 2254 that \nwas not presented in a prior application shall be \ndismissed unless\u2014 \n(A) the applicant shows that the claim relies on \na new rule of constitutional law, made retroac-\ntive to cases on collateral review by the Su-\npreme Court, that was previously unavailable; \nor \n(B)(i) the factual predicate for the claim could \nnot have been discovered previously through \nthe exercise of due diligence; and \n(ii) the facts underlying the claim, if proven \nand viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, \nwould be sufficient to establish by clear and \nconvincing evidence that, but for constitutional \nerror, no reasonable factfinder would have \nfound the applicant guilty of the underlying of-\nfense. \n\n5 \n \n \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal background \n1. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty \nAct of 1996 creates a dual-track system for federal \nhabeas relief. One path is for first-time petitioners. \n\u201cUnder AEDPA, a state prisoner always gets one \nchance to bring a federal habeas challenge to his con-\nviction.\u201d Banister v. Davis, 590 U.S. 504, 509 (2020). \nThis path begins in the district court. If that court \ndenies relief, the prisoner may request a \u201ccertificate \nof appealability\u201d\u2014initially from the district court, \nand then from the court of appeals. See Gonzalez v. \nThaler, 565 U.S. 134, 140 & n.5 (2012). The path ends \nonly when the prisoner has exhausted the chance to \nappeal and seek certiorari. \nThe second path is \u201crockier.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at \n509. A prisoner who wants to file a \u201csecond or succes-\nsive \nhabeas \ncorpus \napplication,\u201d \n28 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2), must first ask the court of appeals for \n\u201can order authorizing the district court to consider \nthe application,\u201d id. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). The appellate \ncourt may oblige only if the prisoner makes a \u201cprima \nfacie showing,\u201d id. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(C), that the petition \n\u201crelies on a new and retroactive rule of constitutional \nlaw\u201d or \u201calleges previously undiscoverable facts that \nwould establish \u2026 innocence,\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at \n509 (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2)). If so, the petition \ngoes to the district court, which must decide for itself \nwhether the petition \u201csatisfies the requirements\u201d of \n\u00a7 2244. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(4). At the same time, be-\ncause any claim \u201cpresented in a prior application\u201d \nmust be dismissed, \u00a7 2244(b)(1), both courts must \ncarefully compare the new petition to all prior peti-\ntions to determine precisely what \u201cclaims\u201d the prison-\n\n6 \n \n \ner has brought. Only then\u2014after all that is done\u2014\nmay the district court reach the merits. \nThe upshot is that much rides on whether \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies\u2014that is: on whether a filing is \ndeemed \u201cpart and parcel of the first habeas proceed-\ning,\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 507, or instead a \u201csecond \nor successive habeas corpus application,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2).  \n2. The phrase \u201csecond or successive\u201d is a \u201cterm of \nart\u201d that does not refer simply to \u201call habeas filings \u2026 \nfollowing an initial application.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at \n511 (first quoting Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, \n486 (2000), then quoting Magwood, 561 U.S. at 332 \n(2010)). To determine when \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies, \u201cthis \nCourt has looked for guidance in two main places.\u201d \nId. at 512. First, the Court has considered history: \n\u201cwhether a type of later-in-time filing would have \nconstituted an abuse of the writ\u201d under the Court\u2019s  \n\u201cpre-AEDPA cases.\u201d Id. (cleaned up) (quoting Panetti \nv. Quarterman, 551 U.S. 930, 947 (2007)). Second, the \nCourt has looked to \u201cAEDPA\u2019s own purposes\u201d: con-\nserving judicial resources, reducing piecemeal litiga-\ntion, and achieving finality \u201cwithin a reasonable \ntime.\u201d Id. (citing Panetti, 551 U.S. at 945\u201346). \nB. Factual and procedural background \nDanny Rivers has spent the last twelve years \nfighting to prove his innocence. Along the way, he \ndiscovered that exculpatory evidence had been sitting \nin his trial counsel\u2019s files all the while\u2014evidence that \nhis lawyers could have used to clear his name. If Riv-\ners is right, then he not only received ineffective as-\nsistance but was also wrongly convicted. This case is \nabout the procedural hurdles that Rivers must clear \nbefore a court will hear him out. \n\n7 \n \n \n1. Rivers is tried and convicted \nIn 2012, a Texas jury convicted Rivers of sexually \nabusing his children and possessing child pornogra-\nphy. He is currently serving a 38-year sentence. \na. This case began amidst a bitter divorce. In 2008, \na Texas judge awarded Rivers temporary custody of \nhis 9-year-old daughter. Rivers v. Lumpkin, No. 7:21-\ncv-00012 (N.D. Tex.), Dkt. 11-14 (\u201cR-1\u201d), at 156, 164. \nThe court also granted Rivers sole use of the family \nhome, ordered his ex-wife to pay child support, and \ndenied her request for alimony. Id. Dkt. 11-15 (\u201cR-2\u201d), \nat 15. In response, Rivers\u2019s ex-wife \u201cpunish[ed]\u201d him \nby \u201cnot letting him see\u201d his 12-year-old stepdaughter, \nwhom he had raised as his own. R-2, at 16. \nThe following year, with custody arrangements un-\nchanged, Rivers\u2019s ex-wife drove the children to the \npolice station while Rivers was away for work. Both \ngirls met with officers and accused Rivers of sexually \nabusing them. R-2, at 18, 129. Police then searched \nRivers\u2019s home, seized the family laptop, and launched \na monthslong forensic examination, eventually identi-\nfying \u201ctwo files of interest\u201d that \u201cappeared to be child \npornography.\u201d Id. at 26, 28; id. Dkt. 11-10 (\u201cR-3\u201d), at \n13, 31, 73; id. Dkt. 11-16, at 15, 66\u201367. \nb. A Wichita County, Texas grand jury indicted \nRivers for continuous sexual abuse, indecency with a \nchild, and two counts of possessing child pornogra-\nphy. R-3, at 8\u201315. Rivers, who had no prior criminal \nhistory, R-2, at 161, pleaded not guilty. \nWith his trial looming, Rivers moved to sever the \nchild-pornography counts, arguing that they might \ncolor the jury\u2019s views on the other charges. R-1, at 15. \nThe state opposed severance. Because its case had \n\u201cno DNA or physical evidence,\u201d Texas argued that the \n\n8 \n \n \nalleged child pornography was \u201cnecessary\u201d to estab-\nlish Rivers\u2019s \u201cmotive\u201d and \u201cattraction to young girls.\u201d \nId. at 14\u201315. The court refused to sever. Id. at 23. \nc. At trial, Rivers\u2019s daughter and stepdaughter al-\nleged a staggering pattern of sexual abuse. R-1, at \n142, 145\u2013146, 167\u2013168. They further claimed that \nRivers had shown them child pornography at least \nseventy times, testifying that he had \u201cdownloaded \nmultiple videos\u201d and played different films on differ-\nent occasions. Id. at 153, 172. Rivers\u2019s daughter also \naccused her father of secretly recording images in the \nshower. R-1, at 170. (No hidden cameras were ever \nfound.) All told, the girls alleged over 200 instances of \nshocking abuse, many of which reportedly took place \nin common areas of the home while their mother, un-\ncle, or cousin were also present in the house. R-1, at \n139, 147, 152\u201353, 156, 158, 166; R-2, at 12, 90. No \nother witnesses saw the alleged abuse, and no physi-\ncal evidence corroborated the story. R-2, at 34, 64. \nGiven the lack of supporting evidence, the alleged \nchild pornography was a key issue at trial. The prose-\ncution called multiple witnesses to testify about the \ntwo files\u2014a single image and a single video\u2014that \nRivers was charged with possessing. R-2, at 19, 28, \n44, 74, 84, 100. While the trial judge had granted a \ncontinuance so the defense could obtain its own fo-\nrensic experts, R-3, at 31, 40, counsel did not do so. \nR-2, at 112. Instead, the defense called only a single \nwitness, who testified that Rivers was out of town \nwhen the files were allegedly downloaded. R-2, at \n113\u2013114, 131. \nd. The jury convicted Rivers on all charges, Pet. \nApp. 2a. It rejected the prosecution\u2019s call for a 169-\nyear sentence, however, and recommended that the \ncourt sentence Rivers to 42 years instead. R-3, at \n\n9 \n \n \n213\u201314, 221\u201329. The court went lower still: 38 years \nbehind bars, all counts considered\u2014just three years \nabove the minimum. Pet. App. 13a. The Texas Court \nof Appeals affirmed. \n2. Rivers seeks postconviction relief \na. In 2013, Rivers began asking his lawyers to send \nhim his client file. He explained: \u201cI don\u2019t know what \nall it contains, but it looks like I\u2019m going to have to do \nthis thing pro se, so I need everything I can get.\u201d \nNo. 7:21-cv-00012 (N.D. Tex.) Dkt. 15-11, at 67. \nCounsel \u201cnever responded to [his] request,\u201d and two \nyears later, Rivers was still trying. Id. at 68\u201369. He \neventually resorted to filing a formal grievance with \nthe Texas state bar. \nMeanwhile, Rivers pressed forward with what rec-\nords he had. In 2016, he sought state postconviction \nrelief based on ineffective assistance, among other \ngrounds. Relevant here, he argued that his trial \ncounsel had failed to \u201cper\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Davis, 590 U.S. \n504, 509 (2020). After that, the stringent gatekeeping \nrequirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2) bar nearly all \nattempts to file a \u201csecond or successive habeas corpus \napplication.\u201d Here, petitioner sought to amend his in-\nitial habeas application while it was pending on ap-\npeal. The Fifth Circuit applied \u00a7 2244(b)(2) and re-\njected the amended filing. \nThe circuits are intractably split on whether \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies to such filings. The Fifth, Sixth, \nSeventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits hold \nthat \u00a7 2244(b)(2) categorically applies to all second-\nin-time habeas filings made after the district court \nenters final judgment. The Second Circuit disagrees, \napplying \u00a7 2244(b)(2) only after a petitioner exhausts \nappellate review of his initial petition. And the Third \nand Tenth Circuits exempt some second-in-time fil-\nings from \u00a7 2244(b)(2), depending on whether a pris-\noner prevails on his initial appeal (Third Circuit) or \nsatisfies a seven-factor test (Tenth Circuit). \nThe question presented is: \nWhether \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies (i) only to habeas fil-\nings made after a prisoner has exhausted appellate \nreview of his first petition, (ii) to all second-in-time \nhabeas filings after final judgment, or (iii) to some \nsecond-in-time filings, depending on a prisoner\u2019s suc-\ncess on appeal or ability to satisfy a seven-factor test. \n \n\nii \n \nRELATED PROCEEDINGS \nEx parte Rivers, WR-84,550-01 & 84,550-02 (Tex. \nCt.

Nine cir-\ncuits have split four ways over that question, and on-\nly this Court can resolve the conflict. \n1. This case is about the hurdles that a prisoner \nmust clear before a court will hear him out. Petitioner \nDanny Rivers sought habeas relief, arguing that his \ncounsel had failed to investigate his case and had \nshown up to trial drunk. The district court denied the \npetition, finding that Rivers couldn\u2019t explain what his \nlawyer should have done differently or why that \nwould have changed things. But the answer soon \nemerged. After fighting for years to obtain his coun-\nsel\u2019s records, Rivers finally received them while his \ninitial petition was up on appeal. Among the files, \nRivers found an exculpatory report suggesting that \nhe was wrongly convicted\u2014evidence that his lawyers \nnever once mentioned at trial.  \nNew evidence in hand, Rivers raced to court\u2014only \nto find the doors barred. Applying \u00a7 2244(b)(2), the \ndistrict court reasoned that it was \u201cwithout jurisdic-\ntion to entertain\u201d the new evidence because Rivers\u2019s \nfiling counted as a \u201csecond or successive\u201d petition. \nPet. App. 19a. (Never mind that his first petition was \nstill pending on appeal and would be for nearly a \nyear.) The Fifth Circuit affirmed, explaining that \u201cfil-\nings introduced after a final judgment that raise ha-\nbeas claims\u201d are \u201cdeemed successive.\u201d Pet. App. 10a. \n\n2 \n \n \n2. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision deepens a circuit con-\nflict over when \u00a7 2244(b)(2) kicks in. In the Second \nCircuit, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) doesn\u2019t apply until a prisoner \nhas exhausted appellate review of his initial habeas \npetition\u2014leaving district courts free to consider a fil-\ning like Rivers\u2019s. As then-Judge Sotomayor put it, \nthat approach guarantees \u201cone full opportunity to \nseek collateral review.\u201d Ching v. United States, 298 \nF.3d 174, 177 (2d Cir. 2002). But the Fifth Circuit ex-\npressly \u201cdecline[d] \u2026 to embrace\u201d that rule. Pet. App. \n10a. Instead, it joined the Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, \nNinth, and Eleventh Circuits in applying \u00a7 2244(b)(2) \nafter the district court enters final judgment. That \napproach effectively grants \u201cone full opportunity to \nseek collateral review in the district court.\u201d United \nStates v. Santarelli, 929 F.3d 95, 104 (3d Cir. 2019) \n(cleaned up). Meanwhile, the Third and Tenth Cir-\ncuits follow their own unique approaches, holding \nthat \u00a7 2244(b)(2) sometimes applies between final \njudgment and exhaustion and sometimes doesn\u2019t. \nThree circuits have already denied rehearing en banc, \nand the rest show no sign of rethinking their views. \nIn short: the circuits are intractably split, the con-\nflict won\u2019t disappear on its own, and this Court\u2019s \nguidance is badly needed. See Balbuena v. Sullivan, \n970 F.3d 1176, 1197, 1200 (9th Cir. 2020) (Fletcher, \nJ., concurring in the result) (\u201curg[ing] the Supreme \nCourt to recognize\u201d and \u201cresolve the conflict\u201d).  \n3. The decision below is also wrong. In Banister v. \nDavis, 590 U.S. 504 (2020), this Court explained that \nthe phrase \u201csecond or successive\u201d is a term of art that \ndoesn\u2019t simply refer to every second-in-time habeas \nfiling. Instead, the Court has looked to historical \npractice and statutory aims when determining \nwhether \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies. But the Fifth Circuit \n\n3 \n \n \ndidn\u2019t even cite Banister, let alone follow its guidance. \nHad it done so, the court would have realized that its \nrule doesn\u2019t square with history. Early courts analyz-\ning abuses of the writ treated appellate review\u2014not \nfinal judgment\u2014as the relevant inflection point. \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s approach will also frustrate \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2)\u2019s aims. At bottom, the question is not \nwhether prisoners like Rivers will try to bring new \nevidence to the courts\u2019 attention. (They will\u2014no mat-\nter what rule this Court adopts.) The question in-\nstead is which court will consider that evidence first. \nUnder the Second Circuit\u2019s approach, a filing like \nRivers\u2019s would have gone to the district court that \njust denied the initial petition: the single member of \nArticle III most familiar with the case. That judge \ncould then have weighed the new evidence and decid-\ned whether to issue an indicative ruling under Feder-\nal Rule of Civil Procedure 62.1. By contrast, the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s rule requires Rivers to ask a brand-new \nthree-judge panel for permission to ask the district \ncourt to consider whether or not to reach the merits. \nIt\u2019s hard to squeeze that rule from the statutory \ntext\u2014and harder still to attribute it to a Congress fo-\ncused on judicial economy, efficiency, and finality. \n4. The question presented is important, and this \ncase is an ideal vehicle. Until this Court weighs in, at \nleast some states and prisoners will be living under \nthe wrong rule, and those in the outstanding circuits \nwill have to guess which rule applies. The interests \non both sides are too critical to leave up to geograph-\nical chance. The split is also outcome-determinative \nhere: if Rivers were incarcerated in New York instead \nof Texas, courts would have considered the new evi-\ndence, giving him a meaningful path to relief. \nThe Court should grant review. \n\n4 \n \n \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe court of appeals\u2019 opinion is reported at 99 F.4th \n216 and is reproduced in the appendix to this petition \nat Pet. App. 1a\u201311a. The district court\u2019s opinion is \nunpublished but is available at 2021 WL 4319670 and \nis reproduced at Pet. App. 12a\u201317a. \nJURISDICTION \nThe Fifth Circuit issued its judgment on April 15, \n2024. Pet. App. 1a. This Court has jurisdiction under \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISION INVOLVED \nSection 2244(b)(2) of Title 28, U.S. Code, provides: \nA claim presented in a second or successive ha-\nbeas corpus application under section 2254 that \nwas not presented in a prior application shall be \ndismissed unless\u2014 \n(A) the applicant shows that the claim relies on \na new rule of constitutional law, made retroac-\ntive to cases on collateral review by the Su-\npreme Court, that was previously unavailable; \nor \n(B)(i) the factual predicate for the claim could \nnot have been discovered previously through \nthe exercise of due diligence; and \n(ii) the facts underlying the claim, if proven \nand viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, \nwould be sufficient to establish by clear and \nconvincing evidence that, but for constitutional \nerror, no reasonable factfinder would have \nfound the applicant guilty of the underlying of-\nfense. \n\n5 \n \n \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal background \n1. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty \nAct of 1996 creates a dual-track system for federal \nhabeas relief. One path is for first-time petitioners. \n\u201cUnder AEDPA, a state prisoner always gets one \nchance to bring a federal habeas challenge to his con-\nviction.\u201d Banister v. Davis, 590 U.S. 504, 509 (2020). \nThis path begins in the district court. If that court \ndenies relief, the prisoner may request a \u201ccertificate \nof appealability\u201d\u2014initially from the district court, \nand then from the court of appeals. See Gonzalez v. \nThaler, 565 U.S. 134, 140 & n.5 (2012). The path ends \nonly when the prisoner has exhausted the chance to \nappeal and seek certiorari. \nThe second path is \u201crockier.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at \n509. A prisoner who wants to file a \u201csecond or succes-\nsive \nhabeas \ncorpus \napplication,\u201d \n28 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2), must first ask the court of appeals for \n\u201can order authorizing the district court to consider \nthe application,\u201d id. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). The appellate \ncourt may oblige only if the prisoner makes a \u201cprima \nfacie showing,\u201d id. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(C), that the petition \n\u201crelies on a new and retroactive rule of constitutional \nlaw\u201d or \u201calleges previously undiscoverable facts that \nwould establish \u2026 innocence,\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at \n509 (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2)). If so, the petition \ngoes to the district court, which must decide for itself \nwhether the petition \u201csatisfies the requirements\u201d of \n\u00a7 2244. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(4). At the same time, be-\ncause any claim \u201cpresented in a prior application\u201d \nmust be dismissed, \u00a7 2244(b)(1), both courts must \ncarefully compare the new petition to all prior peti-\ntions to determine precisely what \u201cclaims\u201d the prison-\n\n6 \n \n \ner has brought. Only then\u2014after all that is done\u2014\nmay the district court reach the merits. \nThe upshot is that much rides on whether \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies\u2014that is: on whether a filing is \ndeemed \u201cpart and parcel of the first habeas proceed-\ning,\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 507, or instead a \u201csecond \nor successive habeas corpus application,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2).  \n2. The phrase \u201csecond or successive\u201d is a \u201cterm of \nart\u201d that does not refer simply to \u201call habeas filings \u2026 \nfollowing an initial application.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at \n511 (first quoting Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, \n486 (2000), then quoting Magwood, 561 U.S. at 332 \n(2010)). To determine when \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies, \u201cthis \nCourt has looked for guidance in two main places.\u201d \nId. at 512. First, the Court has considered history: \n\u201cwhether a type of later-in-time filing would have \nconstituted an abuse of the writ\u201d under the Court\u2019s  \n\u201cpre-AEDPA cases.\u201d Id. (cleaned up) (quoting Panetti \nv. Quarterman, 551 U.S. 930, 947 (2007)). Second, the \nCourt has looked to \u201cAEDPA\u2019s own purposes\u201d: con-\nserving judicial resources, reducing piecemeal litiga-\ntion, and achieving finality \u201cwithin a reasonable \ntime.\u201d Id. (citing Panetti, 551 U.S. at 945\u201346). \nB. Factual and procedural background \nDanny Rivers has spent the last twelve years \nfighting to prove his innocence. Along the way, he \ndiscovered that exculpatory evidence had been sitting \nin his trial counsel\u2019s files all the while\u2014evidence that \nhis lawyers could have used to clear his name. If Riv-\ners is right, then he not only received ineffective as-\nsistance but was also wrongly convicted. This case is \nabout the procedural hurdles that Rivers must clear \nbefore a court will hear him out. \n\n7 \n \n \n1. Rivers is tried and convicted \nIn 2012, a Texas jury convicted Rivers of sexually \nabusing his children and possessing child pornogra-\nphy. He is currently serving a 38-year sentence. \na. This case began amidst a bitter divorce. In 2008, \na Texas judge awarded Rivers temporary custody of \nhis 9-year-old daughter. Rivers v. Lumpkin, No. 7:21-\ncv-00012 (N.D. Tex.), Dkt. 11-14 (\u201cR-1\u201d), at 156, 164. \nThe court also granted Rivers sole use of the family \nhome, ordered his ex-wife to pay child support, and \ndenied her request for alimony. Id. Dkt. 11-15 (\u201cR-2\u201d), \nat 15. In response, Rivers\u2019s ex-wife \u201cpunish[ed]\u201d him \nby \u201cnot letting him see\u201d his 12-year-old stepdaughter, \nwhom he had raised as his own. R-2, at 16. \nThe following year, with custody arrangements un-\nchanged, Rivers\u2019s ex-wife drove the children to the \npolice station while Rivers was away for work. Both \ngirls met with officers and accused Rivers of sexually \nabusing them. R-2, at 18, 129. Police then searched \nRivers\u2019s home, seized the family laptop, and launched \na monthslong forensic examination, eventually identi-\nfying \u201ctwo files of interest\u201d that \u201cappeared to be child \npornography.\u201d Id. at 26, 28; id. Dkt. 11-10 (\u201cR-3\u201d), at \n13, 31, 73; id. Dkt. 11-16, at 15, 66\u201367. \nb. A Wichita County, Texas grand jury indicted \nRivers for continuous sexual abuse, indecency with a \nchild, and two counts of possessing child pornogra-\nphy. R-3, at 8\u201315. Rivers, who had no prior criminal \nhistory, R-2, at 161, pleaded not guilty. \nWith his trial looming, Rivers moved to sever the \nchild-pornography counts, arguing that they might \ncolor the jury\u2019s views on the other charges. R-1, at 15. \nThe state opposed severance. Because its case had \n\u201cno DNA or physical evidence,\u201d Texas argued that the \n\n8 \n \n \nalleged child pornography was \u201cnecessary\u201d to estab-\nlish Rivers\u2019s \u201cmotive\u201d and \u201cattraction to young girls.\u201d \nId. at 14\u201315. The court refused to sever. Id. at 23. \nc. At trial, Rivers\u2019s daughter and stepdaughter al-\nleged a staggering pattern of sexual abuse. R-1, at \n142, 145\u2013146, 167\u2013168. They further claimed that \nRivers had shown them child pornography at least \nseventy times, testifying that he had \u201cdownloaded \nmultiple videos\u201d and played different films on differ-\nent occasions. Id. at 153, 172. Rivers\u2019s daughter also \naccused her father of secretly recording images in the \nshower. R-1, at 170. (No hidden cameras were ever \nfound.) All told, the girls alleged over 200 instances of \nshocking abuse, many of which reportedly took place \nin common areas of the home while their mother, un-\ncle, or cousin were also present in the house. R-1, at \n139, 147, 152\u201353, 156, 158, 166; R-2, at 12, 90. No \nother witnesses saw the alleged abuse, and no physi-\ncal evidence corroborated the story. R-2, at 34, 64. \nGiven the lack of supporting evidence, the alleged \nchild pornography was a key issue at trial. The prose-\ncution called multiple witnesses to testify about the \ntwo files\u2014a single image and a single video\u2014that \nRivers was charged with possessing. R-2, at 19, 28, \n44, 74, 84, 100. While the trial judge had granted a \ncontinuance so the defense could obtain its own fo-\nrensic experts, R-3, at 31, 40, counsel did not do so. \nR-2, at 112. Instead, the defense called only a single \nwitness, who testified that Rivers was out of town \nwhen the files were allegedly downloaded. R-2, at \n113\u2013114, 131. \nd. The jury convicted Rivers on all charges, Pet. \nApp. 2a. It rejected the prosecution\u2019s call for a 169-\nyear sentence, however, and recommended that the \ncourt sentence Rivers to 42 years instead. R-3, at \n\n9 \n \n \n213\u201314, 221\u201329. The court went lower still: 38 years \nbehind bars, all counts considered\u2014just three years \nabove the minimum. Pet. App. 13a. The Texas Court \nof Appeals affirmed. \n2. Rivers seeks postconviction relief \na. In 2013, Rivers began asking his lawyers to send \nhim his client file. He explained: \u201cI don\u2019t know what \nall it contains, but it looks like I\u2019m going to have to do \nthis thing pro se, so I need everything I can get.\u201d \nNo. 7:21-cv-00012 (N.D. Tex.) Dkt. 15-11, at 67. \nCounsel \u201cnever responded to [his] request,\u201d and two \nyears later, Rivers was still trying. Id. at 68\u201369. He \neventually resorted to filing a formal grievance with \nthe Texas state bar. \nMeanwhile, Rivers pressed forward with what rec-\nords he had. In 2016, he sought state postconviction \nrelief based on ineffective assistance, among other \ngrounds. Relevant here, he argued that his trial \ncounsel had failed to \u201cperform an objectively reasona-\nble investigation\u201d or \u201cverify the ages of the persons\u201d \nin the alleged child pornography. No. 7:21-cv-00012 \n(N.D. Tex.), Dkt. 12-21, at 9. He added that his lead \ncounsel was \u201cinebriated\u201d at the trial. Id. at 11. \nThe Texas Court of Criminal Appeals found that \nRivers had \u201calleged facts that, if true, might entitle \nhim to relief.\u201d Ex parte Rivers, 2016 WL 5800277, at \n*1 (Tex. Crim. App. Oct. 5, 2016). It remanded for \nfurther factfinding, ordering the court to appoint \ncounsel if it \u201celect[ed] to hold a hearing.\u201d Id. Judge \nAlcala wrote separately to urge the appointment of \ncounsel \u201cregardless of whether the trial court holds a \nhearing.\u201d Id. (Alcala, J., concurring). \nOn remand, the trial court neither held a hearing \nnor appointed counsel. Instead, it chiefly relied on af-\n\n10 \n \n \nfidavits in which trial counsel defended their perfor-\nmance, denied any drunkenness, and claimed that \nRivers had \u201cadmitted to [them] that he engaged in \nsexual acts with the victims.\u201d Rivers v. Davis, 2018 \nWL 4443153, at *3 (N.D. Tex. July 27, 2018); see also \nNo. 7:17-cv-00124 (N.D. Tex.), Dkt. 24-1, at 24. Rivers \nresponded with his own affidavit, categorically \u201cde-\nny[ing] making such admissions.\u201d Id. at 2. He also \nsubmitted a text message from one of the lawyers\u2019 \nspouses, confirming that counsel \u201cshowed up intoxi-\ncated for court,\u201d id. at 25, and a news report showing \nthat his lead counsel was arrested six months before \nthe trial \u201cafter showing up at a woman[\u2019]s house na-\nked and drunk,\u201d id. at 33 (cleaned up) (quoting Tex-\noma, Local Attorney Sentenced to Two Years Proba-\ntion (Mar. 18, 2015), bit.ly/Barber-Arrest). The trial \ncourt nonetheless \u201cconcluded that counsel were not \nineffective,\u201d and the Court of Criminal Appeals af-\nfirmed. Ex parte Rivers, 2017 WL 3380491, at *1 \n(Tex. Crim. App. June 7, 2017). \nb. Rivers sought federal habeas relief in August \n2017, raising the same ineffective-assistance claims, \namong other grounds. No. 7:17-cv-00124 (N.D. Tex.), \nDkt. 1, at 6. The district court denied Rivers\u2019s habeas \npetition and declined to grant a certificate of appeal-\nability. Pet. App. 2a. Rivers then sought a certificate \nof appealability from the Fifth Circuit. \n3. While his habeas appeal is pending, \nRivers obtains exculpatory evidence \na. While his case was pending on appeal, Rivers fi-\nnally received the client file that he first requested in \n2013. Pet. App. 2a. In it, he found a state investiga-\ntor\u2019s report analyzing the two files underlying his \nchild-pornography conviction. The report called the \nvideo merely \u201cof interest,\u201d without further comment. \n\n11 \n \n \nMeanwhile, the image was labeled \u201cNOT CHILD \nPORN.\u201d No. 7:21-cv-00012 (N.D. Tex.), Dkt. 15-11, at \n75\u201377. The report also listed a number of other files \nfound on the family laptop. Next to one\u2014entitled  \n\u201creallyunderagekiddieporn\u201d\u2014the state investigator \nhad written: \u201calthough the title indicated it to be \nchild porn,\u201d it \u201cis not.\u201d Id. at 75. Another, whose title \nincluded phrases like \u201cpre-teen tiny children\u201d and \n\u201cincest sex porn underage,\u201d was also marked \u201cNOT \nCHILD PORN.\u201d Id. Most telling of all, these files \nand the video \u201cof interest\u201d were not saved under Riv-\ners\u2019s name; they were instead recovered from a down-\nload folder bearing the name of Rivers\u2019s ex-wife. \nAfter discovering the investigator\u2019s report, Rivers \nmoved to supplement the appellate record. See \nNo. 18-11490 (5th Cir.), Dkt. 27. He also filed an affi-\ndavit stating that he had never seen the report and \nnoting that his lawyers had \u201cfailed to raise this ex-\nculpatory evidence\u201d that had been \u201cin [their] posses-\nsion\u201d all along. Id. at 5, 10\u201311. The affidavit added \nthat Rivers\u2019s \u201cestranged wife had access to the house \nand did in fact enter the house, against court orders, \nwhile [Rivers] was out of town during the time frame \nthe alleged child porn was downloaded,\u201d id. at 7\u2014one \nexplanation for why the \u201cchild pornography\u201d ap-\npeared under her username, not his. \nThe Fifth Circuit denied Rivers\u2019s motion to supple-\nment the record but granted a certificate of appeala-\nbility for the ineffective-assistance claim. Id. Dkt. 34, \nat 2. Rivers later asked the court either to stay his \nappeal or to remand so he could seek relief in the dis-\ntrict court without creating \u201cpiecemeal litigation.\u201d Id. \nDkt. 61, at 5\u20136. The Fifth Circuit refused, id. Dkt. 78, \nand ultimately affirmed, see Rivers v. Lumpkin, 2022 \n\n12 \n \n \nWL 1517027 (5th Cir. May 13, 2022), cert. denied, 143 \nS. Ct. 1090 (2023). \nb. In February 2021, while his appeal was still \npending, Rivers used the standard \u00a7 2254 petition \ntemplate provided to pro se litigants to bring the new \nevidence to the district court\u2019s attention. No. 7:21-cv-\n00012 (N.D. Tex.), Dkt. 2, at 7. While the filing also \nraised several new claims, Rivers chiefly argued that \ntrial counsel\u2019s \u201cfail[ure] to present exculpatory evi-\ndence\u201d violated his right to effective assistance. Id. \nDkt. 10, at 24. \nThe same magistrate judge who reviewed Rivers\u2019s \ninitial habeas petition recommended that the new fil-\ning be deemed a \u201csecond or successive\u201d petition and \ntransferred to the Fifth Circuit for lack of jurisdic-\ntion. See Pet. App. 3a\u20134a. Rivers objected to the rec-\nommendation, No. 7:21-cv-00012 (N.D. Tex.), Dkt. 27, \nand \u201cmove[d] the court to consider an interlocutory \nreview,\u201d id. Dkt. 26, at 5. The district court adopted \nthe recommendation and denied Rivers\u2019s motion as \nmoot. See Pet. App. 18a\u201319a \nRivers appealed the transfer order, urging the court \nto construe the February 2021 filing as an amend-\nment to his initial petition, instead of a second or suc-\ncessive petition. Pet. App. 3a\u20134a. The Fifth Circuit \naffirmed. Id. at 1a\u20132a. It reasoned that \u00a7 2244(b)(2) \napplies to \u201cfilings introduced after a final judgment \nthat raise habeas claims, no matter how titled.\u201d Id. at \n10a. Here, the February 2021 filing was \u201csecond-in-\ntime\u201d and \u201cattack[ed] the same conviction that [Riv-\ners had] challenged\u201d in his initial habeas proceeding, \nso it counted as \u201csecond or successive.\u201d Id. at 6a. The \ncourt\u2019s opinion acknowledged that eight other circuits \nhad splintered on the question. Id. at 8a. \n\n13 \n \n \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \nThe courts of appeals are intractably split over \nwhether \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies to a habeas filing made \nafter the district court has denied an initial petition \nbut before an appellate court has weighed in. That \nquestion is critically important to states and prison-\ners alike, and it arises too often to leave up to geo-\ngraphical happenstance. The decision below is also \nwrong. It ignores this Court\u2019s guidance in Banister, \nflies in the face of historical practice, and frustrates\u2014\nrather than furthers\u2014AEDPA\u2019s aims. Finally, this \ncase is an ideal vehicle for the Court to offer much-\nneeded guidance. The issue is cleanly presented and \noutcome-determinative: only the Fifth Circuit\u2019s mis-\ntaken reading of \u00a7 2244(b)(2) stands between Rivers \nand a meaningful path to relief. The Court should \ngrant the petition. \nI. The courts of appeals are split four ways \nover what triggers \u00a7 2244(b)(2), and only \nthis Court can resolve the conflict. \nNine circuits have split four ways over the question \npresented. In the Second Circuit, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) does \nnot apply until the petitioner exhausts appellate re-\nview of his first habeas petition. The Fifth, Sixth, \nSeventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits disa-\ngree, holding that \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies as soon as, or \nshortly after, the district court enters final judgment. \n(Even they can\u2019t agree on the precise trigger.) Mean-\nwhile, the Tenth Circuit applies \u00a7 2244(b)(2) even \nearlier\u2014except when the petitioner satisfies a seven-\nfactor test. And in the Third Circuit, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) tog-\ngles on and off depending on whether the petitioner \nwins or loses on appeal. Respondent acknowledged \nthe split below, see No. 21-11031 (5th Cir.), Dkt. 52, \nat 15\u201324, and only this Court can resolve it.  \n\n14 \n \n \nA. In the Second Circuit, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) does \nnot apply until appellate review of the \nfirst habeas petition is exhausted.  \nIn Whab v. United States, the Second Circuit held \nthat \u00a7 2244(b)(2) does not apply while \u201cappellate pro-\nceedings following the district court\u2019s dismissal of the \ninitial petition remain pending.\u201d 408 F.3d 116, 118 \n(2d Cir. 2005).  \nUsama Whab filed a pro se habeas petition. Id. at \n117. The district court denied the petition and de-\nclined to issue a certificate of appealability. Id. at \n118. Whab then sought a certificate of appealability \nfrom the Second Circuit, which the court ultimately \ndenied. Id. While that motion was still pending, how-\never, Whab asked the Second Circuit for permission \nto file a \u201csecond or successive\u201d petition. Id. at 119. \nThe court held that Whab\u2019s \u201csubsequent petition \nwas not \u2018second or successive\u2019 within the meaning of\u201d \nAEDPA. Id. at 118. Citing then-Judge Sotomayor\u2019s \nrationale in Ching v. United States, it explained that \na petition can\u2019t be \u201csecond or successive\u201d unless it is \nfiled after \u201cthe conclusion of a proceeding that counts \nas the first.\u201d 298 F.3d at 177. And the first proceeding \nisn\u2019t over until the \u201copportunity to seek review in the \nSupreme Court has expired.\u201d Whab, 408 F.3d at 120. \nBecause Whab\u2019s first proceeding was still pending \nwhen he filed his subsequent petition, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) \ndid not apply. Id. at 119.  \nOf course, that doesn\u2019t mean that anything goes. \n\u201cTraditional doctrines, such as abuse of the writ, con-\ntinue to apply.\u201d Id. at 119 n.2. So even if a filing is \nnot \u201csecond or successive\u201d under \u00a7 2244(b)(2), prison-\ners do not get a \u201cfree pass\u201d to \u201cfile numerous petitions \nbefore an initially filed petition is finally adjudicated \n\n15 \n \n \non the merits.\u201d Id.; see also Ching, 298 F.3d at 179\u2013\n80 (\u201cCourts are not obliged to entertain needless or \npiecemeal litigation; nor should they adjudicate a mo-\ntion or petition whose purpose is to vex, harass, or \ndelay.\u201d) Neither can prisoners \u201cprevent the adjudica-\ntion of an initial habeas petition from ever becoming \nfinal by extending the first habeas proceedings \nthrough an infinite number of new petitions.\u201d Fuller \nv. United States, 815 F.3d 112, 113 (2d Cir. 2016). \nSection 2244(b)(2) kicks in \u201cwhen the time to file a \npetition for certiorari \u2026 expire[s]\u201d\u2014whether or not a \nfollow-up petition is still pending. Id. \nSince Whab, the Second Circuit has repeatedly re-\naffirmed this workable approach. E.g., Garcia v. Su-\nperintendent of Great Meadow Corr. Facility, 841 \nF.3d 581, 582 (2d Cir. 2016); Fuller, 815 F.3d at 113.  \nB. In the Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, \nNinth, and Eleventh Circuits, \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies when the district \ncourt enters final judgment or  \nshortly after. \nSix circuits have expressly rejected the Second Cir-\ncuit\u2019s approach, holding that \u00a7 2244(b)(2) is triggered \nat (or around) the time that the district court enters \nfinal judgment. Yet even these courts can\u2019t agree on \nexactly what triggers the statute. \n1. In the Fifth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Elev-\nenth Circuits, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies as soon as the dis-\ntrict court enters final judgment. \na. The Fifth Circuit below recognized the split and \n\u201cdecline[d] \u2026 to embrace\u201d the Second Circuit\u2019s rule, \nholding instead that \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies after the en-\ntry of final judgment. Pet. App. 10a\u201312a. \n\n16 \n \n \nThe district court denied Danny Rivers\u2019s pro se ha-\nbeas petition and entered final judgment. Pet. \nApp. 2a. The Fifth Circuit then granted a certificate \nof appealability as to Rivers\u2019s ineffective-assistance \nclaim. Id. While that appeal was pending, Rivers \nsought further relief in the district court. Applying \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2), the district court deemed Rivers\u2019s filing \na \u201csecond or successive\u201d petition, and the Fifth Cir-\ncuit affirmed. \nAccording to the Fifth Circuit, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) covers \n\u201cfilings introduced after a final judgment that raise \nhabeas claims.\u201d Pet. App. 10a. The court derived that \nrule from this Court\u2019s decision in Gonzalez v. Crosby, \n545 U.S. 524 (2005). The prisoner in Gonzalez \u201cdid \nnot file for rehearing or review\u201d in his first habeas \nproceeding and then sought Rule 60(b) relief a year \nlater. Id. at 527. This Court held that \u00a7 2244(b)(2) did \nnot apply because the prisoner\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion \ndid not raise habeas claims. The Fifth Circuit read \nGonzalez to stand for the \u201cunderlying principle\u201d that \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies after final judgment, lest prison-\ners use \u201cpost-judgment motions\u201d to evade AEDPA. \nBut see Balbuena, 970 F.3d at 1200 (Fletcher, J., con-\ncurring in the result) (\u201cGonzalez does not answer the \nquestion whether [a petition] is a \u2018second or succes-\nsive\u2019 habeas application under \u00a7 2244(b).\u201d). \nb. The Ninth Circuit also applies \u00a7 2244(b)(2) as \nsoon as the district court has \u201cadjudicated [a] habeas \npetition on the merits.\u201d Balbuena v. Sullivan, 980 \nF.3d 619, 642 (9th Cir. 2020).  \nWhile the denial of Alexander Balbuena\u2019s habeas \npetition was still pending on appeal, Balbuena sought \nadditional relief in the district court. Id. at 628, 639. \nThe district court deemed Balbuena\u2019s subsequent fil-\ning \u201can unauthorized second or successive petition,\u201d \n\n17 \n \n \nand the Ninth Circuit affirmed. Id. at 628. Citing cir-\ncuit precedent, it held that \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applied be-\ncause Balbuena \u201csought to add a new claim after the \ndistrict court denied his petition.\u201d Id. at 636\u201337. \nAlong the way, the Ninth Circuit expressly acknowl-\nedged\u2014and \u201cdecline[d] to follow\u201d\u2014the Second Cir-\ncuit\u2019s contrary approach. Id. at 637. \nJudge Fletcher wrote separately to \u201curge the Su-\npreme Court to recognize the circuit split and adopt\u201d \nthe Second Circuit\u2019s rule. Id. at 642 (Fletcher, J., con-\ncurring in the result). In his view, the Ninth Circuit \n\u201cmade a mistake\u201d both \u201cas a matter of ordinary lan-\nguage\u201d and \u201cas a practical matter.\u201d Id. at 644. As to \ntext, he reasoned that \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies \u201conly once \nan appeal has been finally adjudicated.\u201d Id. And as to \nconsequences, he explained that the Second Circuit\u2019s \nrule \u201cwill not result in a flood of late and procedurally \nabusive claims.\u201d Id. He closed by \u201cencourag[ing]\u201d this \nCourt to \u201cresolve the conflict in the circuits\u201d and ex-\npressing \u201coptimis[m]\u201d that it would \u201cagree with\u201d the \nSecond Circuit \u201crather than\u201d the Ninth. Id. at 645. \nc. The Seventh Circuit also holds that final judg-\nment triggers \u00a7 2244(b)(2). See Phillips v. United \nStates, 668 F.3d 433, 435\u201336 (7th Cir. 2012). While \nthe Seventh Circuit was reviewing his habeas denial, \nDavid Phillips asked the district court to consider \nnewly discovered evidence. Id. at 434. The district \ncourt denied that motion on the merits, but the Sev-\nenth Circuit approached things differently. It held \nthat the new filing was not \u201cproperly before the dis-\ntrict court\u201d in the first place because it was a second-\nor-successive petition. Id. That was so (reasoned the \ncourt) because \u201c[f]inal judgment marks a terminal \npoint,\u201d and \u201c[t]reating motions filed during appeal as \n\n18 \n \n \npart of the original application\u201d would undermine \nAEDPA\u2019s \u201ctime-and-number limits.\u201d Id. at 435. \nd. The Eighth Circuit follows a similar approach. \nSee Williams v. Norris, 461 F.3d 999 (8th Cir. 2006). \nAfter the district court denied Frank Williams\u2019s ha-\nbeas petition, it failed to enter a separate final judg-\nment. Id. at 1000\u201301. In the brief period before the \norder became final, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 58, Williams \nmoved to amend the judgment and sought relief from \nit. 461 F.3d at 1000\u201301. The district court denied \nboth motions as second-or-successive habeas peti-\ntions. Id. The Eighth Circuit affirmed, reasoning that \nthe district court had intended to \u201cdispose of Wil-\nliams\u2019s petition on the merits,\u201d so his later filings \nwere \n\u201cpostjudgment\u201d\u2014and \nthus \nsubject \nto \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2). Id. at 1002. \ne. The Eleventh Circuit also applies \u00a7 2244(b)(2) af-\nter final judgment. See United States v. Terrell, 141 \nF. App\u2019x 849, 851\u201352 (11th Cir. 2005). Shortly after \nGeorge Terrell asked the Eleventh Circuit to review \nthe denial of his initial habeas petition, he sought ad-\nditional habeas relief in the district court. Id. at 850\u2013\n51. The district court applied \u00a7 2244(b)(2), deeming \nhis motion an unauthorized second-or-successive ap-\nplication. Id. at 851. The Eleventh Circuit agreed, \nemphasizing that \u201cthe district court had already de-\nnied\u201d Terrell\u2019s initial habeas petition. Id. at 852.  \n2. The Sixth Circuit follows a slightly different rule, \ntying \u00a7 2244(b)(2) to the opportunity for appeal\u2014not \nthe entry of final judgment. \nSamuel Moreland\u2019s initial habeas petition was still \npending on appeal when Moreland sought further \nhabeas relief in the district court. Moreland v. Robin-\nson, 813 F.3d 315, 322 (6th Cir. 2016). The Sixth Cir-\n\n19 \n \n \ncuit deemed Moreland\u2019s filings \u201csecond or successive \nhabeas petitions.\u201d Id. at 319. But instead of pegging \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2) to the entry of final judgment, like the \nFifth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits, \nthe Sixth Circuit focused on the window for appeal. \nIn its view, a motion that \u201cseeks to raise habeas \nclaims\u201d is a \u201csecond or successive habeas petition\u201d \nwhen filed \u201cafter the petitioner has appealed the dis-\ntrict court\u2019s denial of his original habeas petition or \nafter the time for the petitioner to do so has expired.\u201d \nId. at 325. In other words, courts in the Sixth Circuit \nask whether \u201cthe district court has \u2026 lost jurisdiction \nof the original habeas petition.\u201d Jones v. Bradshaw, \n46 F.4th 459, 479\u201381 (6th Cir. 2022). This means that \na petitioner who would be out of luck in the other cir-\ncuits could get relief in the Sixth Circuit while the \nwindow to appeal is still open. \nC. In the Tenth Circuit, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies \nafter a first-in-time petition is filed, un-\nless the petitioner satisfies a seven-\nfactor test.  \nThe Tenth Circuit applies \u00a7 2244(b)(2) whenever a \nsecond-in-time petition raises \u201cseparate and distinct\u201d \nclaims\u2014even if the first-in-time petition is still pend-\ning before the district court. United States v. Espino-\nza-Saenz, 235 F.3d 501, 503, 505 (10th Cir. 2000). \nThat rule puts the Tenth Circuit at odds with not on-\nly the Second Circuit, see Ochoa v. Sirmons, 485 F.3d \n538, 540\u201341 (10th Cir. 2007) (\u201cdeclin[ing]\u201d to follow \nthe Second Circuit\u2019s rule), but also with other circuits \nthat allow amendments before final judgment, e.g., \nPhillips, 668 F.3d at 435.  \nBut petitioners in the Tenth Circuit can avoid this \notherwise strict rule when \u201cjustice\u201d demands. Doug-\nlas v. Workman, 560 F.3d 1156, 1190 (10th Cir. 2009). \n\n20 \n \n \nWhile the denial of his first habeas petition was \npending on appeal, Yancy Douglas asked the Tenth \nCircuit for permission to file a second application as-\nserting that prosecutors had concealed information \nabout a key witness. Id. at 1160, 1167\u201368. The Tenth \nCircuit acknowledged that, under Ochoa, it \u201cwould \nnot ordinarily permit a habeas petitioner to supple-\nment his habeas petition in this way.\u201d Id. at 1189. \nBut this was no ordinary case. Rather, based on \u201csev-\nen factors\u201d\u2014including that Douglas\u2019s initial habeas \npetition remained pending, that the new claim relat-\ned closely to his pending claims, the prosecutor\u2019s con-\nduct, that Douglas faced the death penalty, and dis-\nparity between Douglas and his codefendant\u2014the \ncourt decided to \u201cdeem\u201d the later petition \u201ca supple-\nment to the previously asserted\u201d petition, rather than \na second-or-successive petition. Id. at 1189\u201396. The \nupshot is that courts in the Tenth Circuit don\u2019t apply \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2) under circumstances when courts in the \nFifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Eleventh \nCircuits would have to. See also United States v. \nPickard, 396 F. App\u2019x 568, 572 (10th Cir. 2010). \nD. In the Third Circuit, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) toggles \non and off depending on who wins the \ninitial appeal.  \nFinally, the Third Circuit follows its own unique \nrule. It agrees with the Second Circuit that \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2) does not automatically apply to a \u201csubse-\nquent habeas petition\u201d filed before \u201cexhaustion of ap-\npellate remedies with respect to the denial of [the] \ninitial habeas petition.\u201d Santarelli, 929 F.3d at 104\u2013\n05. But prisoners in Delaware, New Jersey, and \nPennsylvania face a twist that those in Connecticut, \nNew York, and Vermont don\u2019t. When a prisoner in \nthe Third Circuit seeks further habeas relief while \n\n21 \n \n \nhis initial petition is pending on appeal, the applica-\nbility of \u00a7 2244(b)(2) depends on the outcome of that \nappeal. See id. at 104 n.5 (Even if a \u201csubsequent ha-\nbeas petition\u201d is \u201cnot \u2018second or successive\u2019 at the time \nof filing,\u201d it \u201ccould later be construed as a \u2018second or \nsuccessive\u2019 habeas petition.\u201d). \nHere\u2019s the Third Circuit\u2019s logic. While the first peti-\ntion is up on appeal, the petitioner has not had \u201cone \nfull opportunity to seek collateral review.\u201d Id. at 105 \n(citation omitted). So a subsequent petition filed dur-\ning that period should be \u201cconstrued as a motion to \namend\u201d the first petition. Id. at 105\u201306. That motion \nbelongs \u201cin the district court in the first instance.\u201d Id. \nat 106. Yet the district court lacks jurisdiction while \nthe appeal is pending, so the motion to amend must \nstay on ice. Id. Now for the twist. If the Third Circuit \n\u201cvacates or reverses \u2026 and remands the matter,\u201d the \ndistrict court \u201cwould again be vested with jurisdiction \nto consider\u201d the motion. Id. When that happens, \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2) doesn\u2019t apply. On the other hand, if the \nprisoner \u201cexhausts her appellate remedies to no \navail,\u201d she has \u201cexpended the \u2018one full opportunity to \nseek collateral review\u2019 that AEDPA ensures.\u201d Id. (ci-\ntation omitted). In that case, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) does apply \nand\u2014presto!\u2014the \u201cmotion to amend\u201d becomes a \u201csec-\nond or successive\u201d habeas petition. Id. \n*     *     * \nOnly this Court can \u201cresolve the conflict in the cir-\ncuits,\u201d Balbuena, 980 F.3d at 642 (Fletcher, J., con-\ncurring in the result), and there is no reason to wait. \nThree circuits have already denied rehearing en \nbanc\u2014and one of them has done so twice. See Order, \nPhillips v. United States, Nos. 10-2154 & 11-1498 \n(7th Cir. Feb. 21, 2012); Order, Williams v. Norris, \nNo. 04-3485 (8th Cir. Jan. 11, 2007); Order, Balbuena \n\n22 \n \n \nv. Sullivan, Nos. 12-16414, 18-15432 (9th Cir. Nov. \n17, 2020); Order, Jacobs v. Thornell, No. 22-16822 \n(9th Cir. Apr. 9, 2024). The others show no sign of re-\nthinking their positions. Nor is there any need for \nmore percolation. The nine circuits that have already \nweighed in cover roughly 88% of all federal and state \nprisoners. See Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Statistics, \nbit.ly/Federal-Prisons; Prison Pol\u2019y Initiative, Appen-\ndix: State and Federal Prison Populations 2019-2023, \nbit.ly/State-Prisons. All positions are staked out, and \nthis Court now has the benefit of numerous opinions \non the issue. The Court should grant review. \nII. The question presented is critically im-\nportant and recurring. \nA. The question presented is too important to punt. \nSince 1996, AEDPA cases have become a fixture of \nthis Court\u2019s docket. In fact, the Court has repeatedly \ngranted cert to resolve conflicts over this very provi-\nsion. See, e.g., Banister, 590 U.S. at 511 (5-3 split); \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. 524 (2005); Slack v. McDaniel, \n529 U.S. 473 (2000) (3-4 split); Stewart v. Martinez-\nVillareal, 523 U.S. 637, 641 (1998) (1-1 split). That \nalone suggests certworthiness\u2014even apart from the \nfact that this split is deeper than those. \nThe issue is also critically important to parties on \nboth sides. Until this Court weighs in, at least some \nstates and prisoners will be living under the wrong \nrule, and those in the outstanding circuits will have \nto guess which rule applies. For states, that uncer-\ntainty turns AEDPA\u2019s promise of \u201cfinality\u201d on its \nhead. Banister, 590 U.S. at 512. But the stakes are \neven higher for prisoners. Cf. Boumediene v. Bush, \n553 U.S. 723, 739 (2008) (calling habeas \u201cone of the \nfew safeguards of liberty specified in a Constitution \nthat, at the outset, had no Bill of Rights\u201d). \u201cFederal \n\n23 \n \n \npostconviction law is complex, and few prisoners un-\nderstand it well.\u201d Curry v. United States, 507 F.3d \n603, 604 (7th Cir. 2007). So the last thing they need \nwhen seeking to navigate AEDPA\u2019s procedural thick-\net is uncertainty over which thicket they are in. \nB. The need for review is all the more pressing be-\ncause this issue arises so often. Two circuits have \nconfronted the question presented in the last four \nmonths. See Pet. App. 1a; Jacobs v. Thornell, 2024 \nWL 810443 (9th Cir. Feb. 27, 2024). But that\u2019s noth-\ning compared to the district courts. See, e.g., Daly v. \nOliver, 2024 WL 2092997, at *3 (E.D. Pa. May 9, \n2024), appeal docketed, No. 24-2070 (3d Cir. June 18, \n2024); Herrera v. United States, 2024 WL 218964, at \n*1 (N.D. Tex. Jan. 19, 2024); Hernandez v. Macomber, \n2023 WL 2992172, at *3 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 17, 2023); \nThomas v. Sec\u2019y, Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., 2023 WL \n2837521, at *9\u201311 (M.D. Fla. Apr. 7, 2023); Bollinger \nv. Gittere, 2023 WL 2242444, at *1\u20133 (D. Nev. Feb. \n24, 2023), appeal docketed, No. 23-99002 (9th Cir. \nMarch. 28, 2023); Perpall v. United States, 2023 WL \n2016836, at *1\u20132 (S.D. Fla. Feb. 15, 2023) (acknowl-\nedging the split); Atkins v. United States, 2023 WL \n1765536, at *3 (S.D. Fla. Feb. 3, 2023) (same).  \nAnd those are just (some of) the cases available on \nWestlaw. The federal courts received over 14,000 ha-\nbeas petitions last year. See U.S. Courts, Civil Statis-\ntical Tables For the Federal Judiciary (Dec. 31, 2023), \nbit.ly/2023-Statistics. Since one in ten habeas cases \ninvolves an amended petition, see N. King, et al., Fi-\nnal Technical Report: Habeas Litigation in U.S. Dis-\ntrict Courts 34 (2007), bit.ly/Habeas-Report, the real \nnumbers are likely far higher. Cf. Rachel Brown, et \nal., Is Unpublished Unequal? An Empirical Examina-\ntion of the 87% Nonpublication Rate in Federal Ap-\n\n24 \n \n \npeals, 107 Cornell L. Rev. 1, 62 (2021) (finding that \npro se, non-capital habeas cases are \u201cpublished at less \nthan one-third of the overall rate\u201d). \nIII. The decision below is wrong. \nThe Fifth Circuit thought that \u00a7 2244(b)(2) required \nthe district court to dismiss \u201cfor lack of jurisdiction\u201d \nbecause Rivers\u2019s 2021 filing was \u201cintroduced after a \nfinal judgment\u201d and \u201craise[d] habeas claims.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 10a\u201311a. That is wrong. Banister showed how \ncourts should determine \u201cwhat qualifies as second or \nsuccessive,\u201d 590 U.S. at 512, and its logic favors Riv-\ners here. But the Fifth Circuit didn\u2019t even cite Banis-\nter\u2014let alone engage in the proper analysis\u2014and its \nrule doesn\u2019t square with this Court\u2019s holdings either.    \nA. Section 2244(b)(2) does not apply until \nappellate review of the first habeas ap-\nplication is exhausted. \nThe phrase \u201csecond or successive application\u201d is a \n\u201cterm of art\u201d that is \u201cnot self-defining.\u201d Banister, 590 \nU.S. at 511 (quoting Slack, 529 U.S. at 486). To de-\ntermine when \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies, \u201cthis Court has \nlooked for guidance in two main places.\u201d Id. at 512. \nFirst, history: \u201cwhether a type of later-in-time filing \nwould have constituted an abuse of the writ, as that \nconcept is explained\u201d in this Court\u2019s \u201cpre-AEDPA cas-\nes.\u201d Id. (cleaned up) (quoting Panetti, 551 U.S. at \n947). Second, \u201cAEDPA\u2019s own purposes\u201d: conserving \njudicial resources, reducing piecemeal litigation, and \nachieving finality \u201cwithin a reasonable time.\u201d Id. (cit-\ning Panetti, 551 U.S. at 945\u201346). Here, both factors \nalign. Early courts applied abuse-of-the-writ rules in \nlight of appellate review, not final judgment, and ap-\nplying \u00a7 2244(b)(2) to filings like Rivers\u2019s would frus-\ntrate, not further, AEDPA\u2019s aims. \n\n25 \n \n \n1. Courts historically analyzed abuses of \nthe writ by reference to appellate re-\nview, not final judgment. \nThe abuse-of-the-writ doctrine was a nineteenth-\ncentury innovation. \u201c[B]y the common law of Eng-\nland, as it stood at the adoption of the constitution,\u201d \nthe denial of habeas relief was \u201cno bar to the issuing \nof a second or third or more writs, by any other court \nor magistrate having jurisdiction of the case.\u201d Ex \nparte Kaine, 14 F. Cas. 78, 80 (C.C.S.D.N.Y. 1853). \nInstead, \u201ccourts and judges were accustomed to exer-\ncise an independent judgment on each successive ap-\nplication, regardless of the number.\u201d Salinger v. \nLoisel, 265 U.S. 224, 231 (1924). Only later, once \u201ca \nright to an appellate review was given,\u201d did American \ncourts pare back this practice. Id. When they did, \nthey tied abuse-of-the-writ rules to the completion of \nappellate review\u2014not the entry of final judgment.  \nEx parte Cuddy, one of the earliest abuse-of-the-\nwrit cases, is a good example. 40 F. 62, 66 (C.C.S.D. \nCal. 1889) (Field, J.). A district court denied Thomas \nCuddy\u2019s habeas petition, and this Court affirmed. Id. \nat 63 (citing Ex parte Cuddy, 131 U.S. 280 (1889)). \nCuddy then sought habeas relief from Justice Field, \nriding circuit. Justice Field ordered the writ dis-\nmissed, reasoning that \u201ca second application upon the \nsame facts \u2026 should not be heard,\u201d absent \u201cleave to \nmake a new application.\u201d Id. at 66.  \nAlong the way, Justice Field emphasized two \nthings. First, \u201caction \u2026 on the second application\u201d \nshould turn on the \u201ccharacter of the court or officer to \nwhom the first application was made, and the full-\nness of the consideration given to it.\u201d Id. In Cuddy, \nfor example, Justice Field rejected the petition be-\ncause the prisoner sought further relief \u201cafter invok-\n\n26 \n \n \ning the judgment of the appellate court\u201d and \u201cfailing \ntherein.\u201d Id. at 64. In other words: the abuse-of-the-\nwrit doctrine applied after this Court weighed in\u2014\nnot after the district court entered final judgment. In \nfact, had the prisoner not \u201cappealed from the refusal \nof the district court,\u201d he could have \u201capplied to the \ncircuit judge\u201d for the same relief. Id. at 66. Second, \nJustice Field \u201crefer[red], of course,\u201d only to \u201ccases \nwhere a second application is made upon the same \nfacts presented, or which might have been presented\u201d \nin the initial application. Id. In his view, things \nwould be \u201centirely different\u201d if \u201csubsequent occurring \nevents\u201d offered \u201cnew\u201d grounds for consideration. Id. \nThis Court\u2019s abuse-of-the-writ cases followed the \nsame approach. Take Salinger, 265 U.S. at 230\u201332, \nwhich involved a serial habeas petitioner. Citing \nCuddy, the Court explained that an appellate court\u2019s \n\u201cprior refusal\u201d to grant a \u201clike application\u201d carries \nweight \u201cwhen a later application is being considered.\u201d \nId. at 230\u201331. Since the \u201cprior refusal\u201d in Salinger \nwas \u201caffirmed in a considered opinion by a Circuit \nCourt of Appeals,\u201d with \u201cno attempt to obtain\u201d further \nreview, an abuse-of-the-writ dismissal \u201cwould have \nbeen well exercised.\u201d Id. at 226\u201327, 232. Here again, \nwhat mattered was that an appellate court had \nweighed in\u2014not that a district court had denied the \nfirst petition and entered final judgment. \nAll of that boils down to this. When early courts \napplied abuse-of-the-writ rules, they asked whether \nan appellate decisionmaker had spoken\u2014not whether \na district court had entered final judgment. That \nmakes sense, since this Court has long understood \n\u201cproceedings in the appellate tribunal\u201d to be part of \nthe \u201cprocess of law\u201d by which prisoners test the legal-\nity of confinement. Frank v. Mangum, 237 U.S. 309, \n\n27 \n \n \n327 (1915) (discussing appellate review of conviction). \nAgainst that backdrop, a rule that treats final judg-\nment as the relevant inflection point is \u201cbad wine of \nrecent vintage.\u201d Rotkiske v. Klemm, 589 U.S. 8, 14 \n(2019) (citing TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U.S. 19, 37 \n(2001) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment)). \n2. Treating filings like Rivers\u2019s as \u201csec-\nond or successive\u201d would frustrate \nAEDPA\u2019s aims. \nBanister\u2019s other source of guidance\u2014\u201cAEDPA\u2019s own \npurposes\u201d\u2014points the same way. 590 U.S. at 512. \nTreating filings like Rivers\u2019s as \u201csecond or successive\u201d \nwould have baleful \u201cimplications for habeas practice,\u201d \nmaking it unlikely that \u201cCongress would have viewed \n[them] as successive.\u201d Id. at 512\u201313. \na. Judicial resources. So far as the lower courts \nare concerned, the question is not whether prisoners \nlike Rivers will seek further relief while their initial \npetitions are on appeal. The question instead is which \ncourt will review those filings first. Everyone agrees \nthat \u201ca three-judge panel of the court of appeals\u201d is \nthe first port of call for petitions filed after a prisoner \nexhausts appellate review of his initial application. \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(B). But Congress had little \nreason to channel filings like Rivers\u2019s down that \npath\u2014and good reason to treat them as part and par-\ncel of the initial habeas application. \ni. If section 2244(b)(2) is a \u201crock[y]\u201d path for prison-\ners, that goes double for courts. Banister, 590 U.S. at \n509. When the court of appeals receives a \u201csecond or \nsuccessive\u201d petition, three appellate judges have to \ndecide\u2014from square zero, and often without adver-\nsarial briefing\u2014whether the new evidence could have \nbeen \u201cdiscovered previously through the exercise of \n\n28 \n \n \ndue diligence.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(B)(i). Then they \nhave to examine \u201cthe evidence as a whole\u201d and de-\ntermine whether \u201cthe facts underlying the claim, if \nproven,\u201d would be \u201csufficient to establish by clear and \nconvincing evidence\u201d that \u201cno reasonable factfinder\u201d \nwould have convicted but for constitutional error. Id. \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2)(B)(ii). That, in turn, means considering \nthe state\u2019s \u201ctheory of the case,\u201d the evidence \u201csup-\nport[ing]\u201d that theory, and the counterfactual effect of \nthe \u201cnewly-discovered evidence,\u201d including how it \nwould have undermined the state\u2019s evidence and in-\nfluenced the theories\u2014and even \u201calternative theo-\nries\u201d\u2014that both sides could have \u201coffered the jury.\u201d \nMunchinski v. Wilson, 694 F.3d 308, 335\u201337 (3d Cir. \n2012). One recent authorization case was pending be-\nfore the Fifth Circuit for almost three years, and the \nopinion features a two-column, sixteen-row chart that \nspans three pages of the Federal Reporter. See In re \nWill, 970 F.3d 536, 544\u201346 (5th Cir. 2020). And that\u2019s \njust the first step. Even when the appellate court au-\nthorizes a \u201csecond or successive\u201d petition, the district \ncourt must still \u201cconduct its own thorough review\u201d to \nensure \u201cthe requirements of \u00a7 2244(b)(2) have been \nsatisfied.\u201d Id. at 543 (citation and quotation marks \nomitted). Still more: because any claim \u201cpresented in \na prior application\u201d must be dismissed, \u00a7 2244(b)(1), \nboth courts must carefully compare the \u201csecond or \nsuccessive\u201d petition to all prior petitions and deter-\nmine precisely what \u201cclaim[s]\u201d have been brought. Id. \nat 541. That can be especially challenging when the \ncourts confront an \u201cinartistically drawn [pro se] peti-\ntion,\u201d Price v. Johnston, 334 U.S. 266, 292 (1948).  \nii. Now consider the alternative. When Rivers \nsought further relief in February 2021, he went be-\nfore the same magistrate judge and district court \njudge who denied his initial petition. Had those judg-\n\n29 \n \n \nes reached the merits, they\u2014better than anyone\u2014\nwould have known whether his new evidence was \nworth the candle. If not: game over. If so, the court \ncould have issued an indicative ruling under Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 62.1. E.g., Parry v. Kerestes, \n2013 WL 6002358 (W.D. Pa. Nov. 12, 2013). Either \nway, a judge \u201cfamiliar with a habeas applicant\u2019s \nclaims\u201d would likely make \u201cquick work\u201d of a filing like \nthis. Banister, 590 U.S. at 517. That\u2019s good reason to \nthink that a Congress concerned about judicial re-\nsources \u201cwould have viewed\u201d such filings as \u201cpart and \nparcel of the first habeas proceeding.\u201d Id. at 507, 513.  \nb. Reducing piecemeal litigation. The latter \npath would serve AEDPA\u2019s second aim too\u2014and this \ncase is Exhibit A. New evidence in hand, Rivers \nasked the Fifth Circuit to remand so that he could \nseek relief on \u201call [his] claims rather than revisiting \nthis case in piecemeal litigation.\u201d No. 18-11490 (5th \nCir.) Dkt. 61, at 5\u20136. When that failed, he asked the \ndistrict court to \u201cconsider an interlocutory review\u201d to \n\u201cprevent unnecessary litigation and to preserve judi-\ncial resources.\u201d No. 7:21-cv-00012 (N.D. Tex.), Dkt. \n26, at 5. Instead, the court transferred the matter to \nthe Fifth Circuit, which opened a brand new proceed-\ning, where Rivers must convince three judges to au-\nthorize a fourth judge to consider whether or not to \nconsider the new evidence. \nc. Finality. Finality cuts the same way. Suppose \nthat the state investigator\u2019s report that Rivers dis-\ncovered in his client file isn\u2019t the bombshell that Riv-\ners reckons. In that case, the way to \u201clend[] finality\u201d \nto Rivers\u2019s conviction \u201cwithin a reasonable time\u201d \nwould have been for the district court to say so in \nSeptember 2021. Banister, 590 U.S. at 512. Had it \ndone that, this case would be over. Instead, the lower \n\n30 \n \n \ncourts sent Rivers and Texas down a path that could \nprolong this case\u2014and leave the validity of Rivers\u2019s \nconviction up in the air\u2014for years to come. \n* \n* \n* \nHad Congress wanted all post-judgment habeas fil-\nings to count as second or successive petitions, \u201cit eas-\nily could have written\u201d such a law. Ali v. Fed. Bureau \nof Prisons, 552 U.S. 214, 227 (2008). But it\u2019s hard to \nsqueeze that rule from the text of \u00a7 2244(b)(2) and the \nhistory against which it was written. And it\u2019s even \nharder to attribute the consequences to a Congress \nfocused on judicial resources, efficiency, and finality. \nSee N.Y. State Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs. v. Dublino, 413 \nU.S. 405, 419\u201320 (1973) (\u201cWe cannot interpret federal \nstatute to negate their own stated purposes.\u201d).  \nB. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision cannot be \nsquared with this Court\u2019s cases. \nThe Fifth Circuit addressed none of this. It did not \nask whether Rivers\u2019s filing \u201cwould have constituted \nan abuse of the writ, as that concept is explained in \n[this Court\u2019s] pre-AEDPA cases.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. \nat 512 (cleaned up) (quoting Panetti, 551 U.S. at 947). \nIt did not explain how its approach would \u201cconserv[e] \njudicial resources\u201d or \u201cstreamlin[e] habeas cases.\u201d Id. \nat 515, 517. And while it offered vague generalities \nabout evading AEDPA\u2019s limitations, it said not a \nword about finality, let alone whether its rule would \nhasten or hinder that objective here. In fact, the court \ndidn\u2019t even cite Banister\u2014even through both parties \nrelied on that case in their briefs. \nNor does the Fifth Circuit\u2019s approach square with \nthis Court\u2019s holdings. Gregory Banister\u2019s Rule 59(e) \nmotion came \u201cafter a final judgment\u201d and raised \u201cha-\nbeas claims,\u201d Pet. App. 10a, but this Court still held \n\n31 \n \n \nthat it was \u201cpart and parcel of the first habeas pro-\nceeding,\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 507. Likewise, the \nprisoner in Slack filed a post-final-judgment habeas \npetition, and this Court allowed that to proceed too. \nSlack, 529 U.S. at 487. And the same was true in \nStewart, where the prisoner\u2019s post-final-judgment \nhabeas application \u201cwas not a \u2018second or successive\u2019 \npetition\u2019 under \u00a7 2244(b).\u201d 523 U.S. at 643\u201345. \nIV. This case is an excellent vehicle. \nThis case is an ideal vehicle to finish what Banister \nstarted. The question presented raises a pure legal \nissue that was fully briefed and squarely decided be-\nlow. There are no preservation problems, alternative \nholdings, or factual disputes that would frustrate re-\nview. And the split is outcome-determinative. The \nFifth Circuit declined to consider Rivers\u2019s new evi-\ndence because it thought \u00a7 2244(b)(2) required that \nresult. Yet if Rivers were held in Buffalo, New York, \ninstead of Beeville, Texas, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) would have \nbeen no barrier, and the lower courts could have \nreached the merits. In other words, if this Court re-\nverses and adopts the Second Circuit\u2019s rule, Rivers \nwill have a meaningful path to relief. The lower \ncourts denied Rivers\u2019s initial petition largely because \nhe could not pinpoint what his counsel should have \ndone differently or how that might have changed \nthings. See Rivers, 2018 WL 4443153, at *4. But the \nnew evidence puts those questions to rest. Now all \nthat stands between Rivers and a fighting chance is \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s mistaken reading of \u00a7 2244(b)(2).  \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should grant the petition. \n \n\n32 \n \n \nRespectfully submitted,  \n \n \nPeter A.

The second petition, dubbed by Rivers as an \nattempt to amend his initial petition, reiterated an \nineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim from his first \npetition as well as raised new habeas claims, again \nchallenging his underlying state convictions.

The court below\u2014and the majority of \nthe circuits\u2014have issued decisions fully consistent \nwith this Court\u2019s precedents and with AEDPA\u2019s clear \npurposes. The circuit majority rule minimizes the \nwaste of judicial resources, restricts piecemeal \nlitigation, and promotes the finality of criminal \nconvictions. \nThe \nremaining \ncircuits\u2014a \nsmall \nminority\u2014should self-correct, especially under the \nguidance of this Court\u2019s more recent decision in \nBanister v. Davis, 590 U.S. 504 (2020). Accordingly, \nRivers should be denied certiorari review. \n \nOPINIONS BELOW \n \nThe opinion of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals is \nreported at Rivers v. Lumpkin, 99 F.4th 216 (5th Cir. \n2024). Pet. App. 1a\u201311a. The district court\u2019s order \nadopting the magistrate judge\u2019s findings, conclusions, \nand \nrecommendation \n(Pet. \nApp. \n12a\u201317a), \nis \nunreported. Pet. App. 18a\u201319a. \n \n \nJURISDICTION \n \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment was entered on April \n15, 2024. Pet. App. 1a. This Court has jurisdiction \nunder the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1254(1) and \n2253(c). \n \nSTATUTORY PROVISION INVOLVED \n \nThe Question Presented involves the application of \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(a)\u2013(b): \n \n(a) No circuit or district judge shall be \n\n \n2 \n \nrequired to entertain an application for a \nwrit of habeas corpus to inquire into the \ndetention of a person pursuant to a \njudgment of a court of the United States \nif it appears that the legality of such \ndetention has been determined by a judge \nor court of the United States on a prior \napplication for a writ of habeas corpus, \nexcept as provided in section 2255. \n \n(b)(1) A claim presented in a second or \nsuccessive habeas corpus application \nunder section 2254 that was presented in \na prior application shall be dismissed. \n \n     (2) A claim presented in a second or \nsuccessive habeas corpus application \nunder \nsection \n2254 \nthat \nwas \nnot \npresented in a prior application shall be \ndismissed unless\u2014 \n(A) the applicant shows that the \nclaim relies on a new rule of \nconstitutional \nlaw, \nmade \nretroactive to cases on collateral \nreview by the Supreme Court, that \nwas previously unavailable; or \n(B)(i) the factual predicate for the \nclaim \ncould \nnot \nhave \nbeen \ndiscovered previously through the \nexercise of due diligence; and \n     (ii) the facts underlying the \nclaim, if proven and viewed in light \nof the evidence as a whole, would \nbe sufficient to establish by clear \nand convincing evidence that, but \n\n \n3 \n \nfor \nconstitutional \nerror, \nno \nreasonable factfinder would have \nfound the applicant guilty of the \nunderlying offense. \n \n    (3)(A) Before a second or successive \napplication permitted by this section is \nfiled in the district court, the applicant \nshall move in the appropriate court of \nappeals for an order authorizing the \ndistrict court to consider the application. \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE  \n \nA Texas jury found Rivers guilty of one count of \ncontinuous sexual abuse of a young child (Count I), two \ncounts of indecency with a child by contact (Counts II \nand III), one count of indecency with a child by \nexposure (Count IV), and two counts of possession of \nchild pornography (Counts V and VI). Rivers v. State, \nNo. 08-12-00145-CR, 2014 WL 3662569 (Tex. App.\u2014El \nPaso Jul. 23, 2014, pet. ref\u2019d). Rivers received \nsentences of thirty years\u2019 incarceration for Count I, \nthree years\u2019 incarceration each for Counts II and III, \nand two years\u2019 incarceration for Count IV, all to run \nconsecutively. Id.  He received two concurrent two-year \nsentences for Counts V and VI. Id. \n \n \nAfter exhausting his available state remedies, \nRivers first sought federal habeas relief in August \n2017. Pet. App. 2a. The district court entered final \njudgment and denied Rivers\u2019 claims on the merits in \nSeptember 2018. Id. Rivers appealed from the denial, \nand the Fifth Circuit granted a certificate of \nappealability on his claim that his trial counsel was \n\n \n4 \n \nineffective for failing to conduct a reasonable \ninvestigation and interview witnesses. Id. The Fifth \nCircuit ultimately affirmed the district court\u2019s final \njudgment in May 2022. Pet. App. 3a.  \n \n \nBack in February 2021, while the appeal of his first \npetition was still pending, Rivers filed a second petition \nto challenge the same convictions. Pet. App. 2a. In the \nsecond petition, Rivers reasserted that his trial counsel \nwas ineffective and added a myriad of new claims. Id. \nRivers alleged that the new claims arose from \ninformation he gleaned from his attorney-client file, \nwhich he obtained in October 2019. Id. The district \ncourt found that it lacked jurisdiction over this petition \nbecause it was \u201csecond or successive\u201d to his previous \npetition and transferred it to the Fifth Circuit Pet. App. \n12a\u201319a. Pursuant to the transfer order, an original \nproceeding was docketed in the Fifth Circuit for Rivers \nto file a motion for authorization to file a successive \nhabeas petition. See In re Rivers, No. 21-10967 (5th Cir. \nSep. 24, 2021); see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3). Instead of \nmoving for authorization, Rivers filed a notice of appeal \nchallenging the district court\u2019s transfer order and \nurged the Fifth Circuit to construe his second petition \nas a motion to amend his first petition. Pet. App. 3a\u2013\n4a. The Fifth Circuit dismissed the authorization \nproceeding because Rivers never filed a supporting \nmotion. Order, In re Rivers, No. 21-10967 (5th Cir. Nov. \n15, 2021).  \n \n \nThe Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s \ntransfer order on April 15, 2024, holding that the \nsecond petition was successive and thus subject to the \nrequirements of \u00a7 2244. Pet. App. 11a. Rivers now \nseeks certiorari to challenge that decision. \n\n \n5 \n \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe Court Should Deny Certiorari Because \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s Decision Is Consistent \nwith, and Mandated by, This Court\u2019s Cases. \n \nCertiorari is unwarranted. The Fifth Circuit \ncorrectly held that Rivers\u2019 second petition is an \nunauthorized successive petition subject to the \nrequirements of \u00a7 2244(b). See Pet. App. 11a. This \nholding is consistent with Gonzalez and Banister. See \nGonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524 (2005) (holding that a \npost-judgment filing is a successive habeas petition if \nit advances habeas claims); Banister v. Davis, 590 U.S. \n504 (holding that a motion to amend or alter a \njudgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) \nis not successive because it is part of the final judgment \nin the initial habeas proceeding). \n \n \nThe restrictions on \u201csecond or successive\u201d federal \nhabeas petitions in \u00a7 2244(b) apply to Rivers\u2019 second \npetition because it challenged the same six-count \njudgment of conviction as his initial petition. See \nMagwood v. Patterson, 561 U.S. 320, 331 (2010) \n(holding that \u00a7 2244(b) applies \u201conly to a \u2018second or \nsuccessive\u2019 application challenging the same state-\ncourt judgment.\u201d). The Fifth Circuit properly relied on \nthis Court\u2019s analysis in Gonzalez to determine whether \nRivers\u2019 post-judgment \u201cmotion to amend\u201d his initial \nhabeas petition, i.e., his second habeas petition, was \n\u201csecond or successive\u201d to his initial habeas petition \nunder \u00a7 2244(b). Pet. App. 9a\u201310a (citing Gonzalez, 545 \nU.S. at 531\u201332). The court below found Rivers\u2019 second \npetition to be successive because it was a post-\njudgment filing that advanced habeas claims. Pet. App. \n\n \n6 \n \n9a\u201310a (\u201c[F]ilings introduced after a final judgment \nthat raise habeas claims, no matter how titled, are \ndeemed successive\u201d) (citing Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 531\u2013\n32). Chronology does not end the inquiry, however, as \nthis Court has clarified that not all habeas filings made \nafter an initial application qualify as \u201csecond or \nsuccessive.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 511\u201312; Magwood, \n561 U.S. at 332; Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U.S. 930, \n944 (2007).  \n \n \nThus, relying on Gonzalez, the Fifth Circuit \nproperly looked \u201cat the nature of the relief sought rather \nthan the filing\u2019s label to determine whether failing to \nsubject \n[Rivers\u2019 \nsecond \npetition] \nto \nthe \nsame \nrequirements would be inconsistent with the statute.\u201d \nPet. App. 10a (quoting Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 531) \n(cleaned up) (emphasis added). Although Rivers\u2019 \nsecond petition was characterized as a motion to \namend and not a Rule 60(b) motion, \u201cthat is a \ndistinction without a difference.\u201d Pet. App. 9a\u201310a \n(citing Gonzalez, 545 U.S. 527). His second petition\u2014\nthough \u201ccouched in the language\u201d of a motion to \namend\u2014was properly construed as a successive \npetition because it both \u201cattack[ed] the federal court\u2019s \nresolution of [his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel] \nclaim on the merits\u201d by raising ineffective assistance of \ncounsel yet again and \u201csought to add [] new grounds for \nrelief.\u201d Pet. App. 10a (citing Gonzalez, 545 U.S. 531\u2013\n32). AEDPA afforded Rivers one chance to challenge \nhis convictions, and he availed of that chance with his \ninitial habeas petition. See Magwood, 561 U.S. at 333\u2013\n34. The court below rightly relied on Gonzalez and saw \nRivers\u2019 second petition for what it was: an attempted \nsecond bite of the proverbial apple and thus subject to \nauthorization requirements of \u00a7 2244(b). The transfer \n\n \n7 \n \norder was not only correct; it was mandated. Failure to \nread Rivers\u2019 second petition in tandem with \u00a7 2244 \nwould have \u201ccircumvent[ed] the requirement that a \nsuccessive habeas petition be precertified by the court \nof appeals as falling within an exception to the \nsuccessive-petition bar.\u201d See Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 532 \n(citation and internal quotation omitted). \n \n \nRivers\u2019 complaint that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision \n\u201cignores this Court\u2019s guidance in Banister\u201d is wholly \nnon-sequitur. Pet. Cert. 13. As in Gonzalez, the final \njudgment of the initial habeas proceeding is the crux of \nthe inquiry in Banister. The Court explicitly \ndistinguished a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend a \njudgment as not subject to \u00a7 2244(b) because the \nmotion suspends the finality of the judgment, and the \nruling on the motion merges into the final judgment, \nthus ultimately making the Rule 59(e) motion \u201cpart \nand parcel\u201d of the initial habeas proceeding. Banister, \n590 U.S. at 507\u201309. This Court\u2019s holding in Gonzalez \nthat a post-judgment filing \u201ccounts as a second or \nsuccessive habeas application if it \u2018attacks the federal \ncourt\u2019s previous resolution of a claim on the merits\u2019 . . . \ndoes not alter that conclusion.\u201d Id. at 505 (citing \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. 532).  \n \n \nLike a Rule 60(b) motion that advances habeas \nclaims and would thus unequivocally count as a \nsuccessive petition, Rivers\u2019 second petition \u201cdiffers \nfrom a Rule 59(e) [motion] in just about every way that \nmatters to the inquiry here.\u201d See Banister, 590 U.S. at \n516. That is, Rivers\u2019 second petition is unlike a Rule \n59(e) motion in timing, scope, and procedural posture. \nA Rule 59(e) motion must be brought within 28 days of \nfinal judgment and requests only \u201creconsideration of \n\n \n8 \n \nmatters properly encompassed\u201d in the challenged \njudgment. Id. at 516. It is a \u201cone-time effort to bring \nalleged errors in a just-issued decision to a habeas \ncourt\u2019s attention, before taking a single appeal.\u201d Id. \nDespite Rivers\u2019 wishes, his second petition cannot be \ntreated akin to a Rule 59(e) motion as \u201cpart and parcel\u201d \nof his initial habeas proceeding because it was: (1) filed \nin a new, separately numbered district court \nproceeding; (2) more than 28 days after final judgment; \nand (3) exceeded the scope of claims that were raised \nin his initial petition. \n \n \nIn sum, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision comports with \nboth Gonzalez and Banister. Certiorari is unwarranted \nbecause this Court has provided sufficient guidance as \nto what constitutes a successive petition, and the lower \ncourt\u2019s analysis correctly relied on that guidance. The \nonly legally available way to merge Rivers\u2019 new habeas \nclaims \ninto \nhis \nfirst-in-time \npetition\u2019s \nalready \ncompleted judgment is a Rule 60(b) motion, which this \nCourt in Gonzalez already established would be a \nsuccessive petition. \n \nII. \nThe Court Should Deny Certiorari Because \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s Decision Is Consistent \nwith AEDPA\u2019s Aims. \n \nRivers argues that the lower court was wrong \nbecause its approach \u201cwould frustrate AEDPA\u2019s aims.\u201d \nPet. Cert. 27. His arguments have no force because he \ndisregards Congress\u2019 intent in enacting \u00a7 2244(b). \nOddly enough, Rivers faults the Fifth Circuit for not \nasking whether his filing \u201cwould have constituted an \nabuse of the writ,\u201d as the historical doctrine is \nexplained in Banister. Pet. Cert. 30 (citing Banister, \n\n \n9 \n \n590 U.S. at 512) (cleaned up). In doing so, Rivers \nsuggests that the abuse-of-the-writ doctrine should \nsupplant \u00a7 2244(b) as gatekeeper. However, this Court \nhas previously explained that the text of AEDPA as \nwritten\u2014and not pre-AEDPA doctrines like abuse of \nthe writ\u2014controls whether a filing is successive. See \nMagwood, 561 U.S. at 338 (\u201cIn light of this complex \nhistory of the phrase \u2018second or successive,\u2019 we must \nrely upon the current text to determine when the \nphrase applies, rather than pre-AEDPA precedents or \nsuperseded statutory formulations.\u201d).  \n \n \nMoreover, the debate over AEDPA reveals that \nCongress likely intended to override the pre-AEDPA \nlegal standards such as abuse of the writ. See, e.g., 141 \nCong. Rec. 15047 (1995) (\u201cWe are into that school that \nsays . . . drastically curtail the time within which \nsomeone is able to file a habeas petition and how many \ntimes they are able to file one and what constitutes a \nsuccessive petition\u201d); accord id. at 15054\u2013055 (\u201c[S]ome \nreform of habeas corpus is necessary. . . . I support \nlimits on successive, repetitive petitions.\u201d). The \nhistorical \nabuse-of-the-writ \ndoctrine \n\u201cwas \nmore \nforgiving than AEDPA\u2019s gatekeeping provision\u201d to the \nextent that successive petitions were a persistent, \nrecurring issue prior to AEDPA\u2019s enactment. See \nBanister, 590 U.S. at 514 (citing McCleskey v. Zant, 499 \nU.S. 467, 485 (1991)); 141 Cong. Rec. 15039 (\u201c[T]he \ncourt as well as the Congress has found that the writs \nof habeas corpus . . . the petition, more accurately, \nseeking a writ, has been used excessively. This has \nbeen happening for many, many years.\u201d). It thus \nfollows that more stringent amendment to \u00a7 2244(b) \nwas Congress\u2019 solution to curtail the problem of \nsuccessive habeas petitions, to serve as gatekeeper \n\n \n10 \n \nwhere the abuse-of-the-writ doctrine failed. The Fifth \nCircuit did not consider whether Rivers\u2019 second \npetition constituted abuse of the writ because the text \nof \u00a7 2244, not abuse of the writ, was the relevant \ninquiry. \n \nA. Congress determined that the application \nof AEDPA\u2019s successive bar conserves \njudicial \nresources, \nwhile \npre-AEDPA \ndoctrines wasted them. \n \nRivers suggests that the procedural impediments of \n\u00a7 2244(b) are, in of themselves, inefficient at conserving \njudicial resources. See Pet. Cert. 27\u201330 (\u201cIf section \n2244(b)(2) is a \u2018rock[y]\u2019 path for prisoners, that goes \ndouble for courts.\u201d) (quoting Banister, 590 U.S. at 509). \nIn other words, he suggests that the plain text of \n\u00a7 2244(b) should not control because the historical pre-\nAEDPA doctrines such as abuse of the writ better \nconserved judicial resources. See id. at 30 (\u201cHad \nCongress wanted all post-judgment habeas filings to \ncount as second or successive petitions, it easily could \nhave written such a law. But it\u2019s hard to squeeze that \nrule from the text of \u00a7 2244(b)(2) and the history \nagainst which it was written.\u201d).  \n \nBut Rivers\u2019 argument is inapposite, because \nCongress concluded that the pre-AEDPA legal \nstandards were inefficient and wasted judicial \nresources. Rivers cannot take issue with Congress\u2019 \npolicy determinations, and neither should the Court. \nSee Felker v. Turpin, 518 U.S. 651, 664 (1996) (\u201c[W]e \nhave likewise recognized that judgments about the \nproper scope of the writ are normally for Congress to \nmake.\u201d). Furthermore, Rivers ignores the fact that a \n\n \n11 \n \ncircuit court\u2019s authorization decision is not itself an \n\u201cappeal,\u201d and cannot be further appealed, either en \nbanc or to this Court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(E) (\u201cThe \ngrant or denial of an authorization by a court of appeals \nto file a second or successive application shall not be \nappealable and shall not be the subject of a petition for \nrehearing or for a writ of certiorari.\u201d). Because this \nlimitation represents the \u201cmaximum\u201d conservation of \njudicial resources, as contemplated by Congress, \nRivers\u2019 arguments necessarily expend more judicial \nresources in comparison. \n \n \nMoreover, it cannot follow that the district court \nshould have issued an indicative ruling on his second \npetition under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62.1 if \nit found that Rivers \u201cnew evidence was [not] worth the \ncandle.\u201d Pet. Cert. 29 (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 62.1). It \nwas the prerogative of the Fifth Circuit to assess the \nbasis of Rivers\u2019 new claims, had he complied with \nAEDPA\u2019s mandate that he move for authorization. See \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b). Such an analysis under \u00a7 2244(b) \nsupplants the ruling Rivers desired under Rule 62.1. \nAs this Court in Banister admonished, the restrictions \nof \u00a7 2244(b), \u201clike all statutes and rules pertaining to \nhabeas, trump any \u2018inconsistent\u2019 Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure \notherwise \napplicable \nto \nhabeas \nproceedings.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 509. This \nargument, too, falters. \n \n \n\n \n12 \n \nB. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s application of \u00a7 2244(b) \ndecreases piecemeal litigation.  \n \n \nRivers argues that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s approach \nincreases piecemeal litigation because the district \ncourt should have considered his second petition on the \nmerits rather than transfer it to the Fifth Circuit. Pet. \nCert. 29. Rivers again suggests that the procedural \nimpediments \nof \n\u00a7 \n2244(b) \nthemselves \npromote \npiecemeal litigation. First, Rivers\u2019 argument fails to \nacknowledge that the district court lacked authority to \nreopen the judgment while the denial of his first \npetition remained pending on appeal because it had no \njurisdiction to consider an \u201camended\u201d petition. Second, \nthe only way Rivers could have reopened the judgment \nto amend his first petition more than 28 days after final \njudgment would have been a Rule 60(b) motion, which \nwould be plainly successive under Gonzalez because it \nincreases piecemeal litigation.   \n \nC. Congress intended for AEDPA and its \nsuccessive bar to promote finality.  \n \n \nRivers argues that if the evidence that formed the \nbasis of his new claims \u201cisn\u2019t the bombshell that Rivers \nreckons,\u201d the district court should have denied the \nclaims in his second petition on the merits. Pet. Cert. \n29 (\u201cHad it done that, this case would be over.\u201d). But \nbecause the district court lacked jurisdiction to \nconsider the second petition, \u00a7 2244(b) required that \nthe court transfer it to the Fifth Circuit. Yet again, he \nsuggests that the procedural requirements of \u00a7 2244(b) \nare themselves impediments to conviction finality. Id. \nat 29\u201330 (\u201cInstead, the lower courts sent Rivers and \nTexas down a path that could prolong this case.\u201d).  \n\n \n13 \n \n \nIn enacting \u00a7 2244(b), Congress \u201caimed to prevent \nserial challenges to a judgment of conviction.\u201d Banister, \n590 U.S. at 515. Yet Rivers\u2019 proposed approach would \nallow petitioners to make an infinite number of post-\njudgment \u201camendments\u201d to an initial petition so long \nas that petition remains pending on appeal. See id. at \n521. Allowing petitioners to raise habeas claims ad \ninfinitum during the post-judgment pendency of the \ninitial petition runs contrary to \u00a7 2244(b)\u2019s purpose to \n\u201c\u2018conserve judicial resources, reduc[e] piecemeal \nlitigation,\u2019 and \u2018lend[ ] finality to state court judgments \nwithin a reasonable time.\u2019\u201d Id. at 512 (citing Panetti, \n551 U.S. at 945\u201346). In sum, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision \nbelow aligns with AEDPA and Congress\u2019 intent \ntherein. \n \nIII. \nThe Decision Below Is Fully Consistent \nwith the Majority of Circuit Courts to Have \nAddressed This Issue; the Court Should \nDeny Certiorari to Allow the Minority \nCircuits to Self-Correct. \n \nThe rule followed by the majority of circuits is \ncorrect, for the reasons explained above. The Fifth \nCircuit, along with the Fourth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, \nand Eleventh Circuits, all agree that an initial habeas \nproceeding is \u201cconcluded\u201d once the district court has \nissued a final judgment, regardless of a pending \nappeal; any later attempts to advance habeas claims \nare deemed succe\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

The court below\u2014and the majority of \nthe circuits\u2014have issued decisions fully consistent \nwith this Court\u2019s precedents and with AEDPA\u2019s clear \npurposes. The circuit majority rule minimizes the \nwaste of judicial resources, restricts piecemeal \nlitigation, and promotes the finality of criminal \nconvictions. \nThe \nremaining \ncircuits\u2014a \nsmall \nminority\u2014should self-correct, especially under the \nguidance of this Court\u2019s more recent decision in \nBanister v. Davis, 590 U.S. 504 (2020). Accordingly, \nRivers should be denied certiorari review. \n \nOPINIONS BELOW \n \nThe opinion of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals is \nreported at Rivers v. Lumpkin, 99 F.4th 216 (5th Cir. \n2024). Pet. App. 1a\u201311a. The district court\u2019s order \nadopting the magistrate judge\u2019s findings, conclusions, \nand \nrecommendation \n(Pet. \nApp. \n12a\u201317a), \nis \nunreported. Pet. App. 18a\u201319a. \n \n \nJURISDICTION \n \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment was entered on April \n15, 2024. Pet. App. 1a. This Court has jurisdiction \nunder the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1254(1) and \n2253(c). \n \nSTATUTORY PROVISION INVOLVED \n \nThe Question Presented involves the application of \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(a)\u2013(b): \n \n(a) No circuit or district judge shall be \n\n \n2 \n \nrequired to entertain an application for a \nwrit of habeas corpus to inquire into the \ndetention of a person pursuant to a \njudgment of a court of the United States \nif it appears that the legality of such \ndetention has been determined by a judge \nor court of the United States on a prior \napplication for a writ of habeas corpus, \nexcept as provided in section 2255. \n \n(b)(1) A claim presented in a second or \nsuccessive habeas corpus application \nunder section 2254 that was presented in \na prior application shall be dismissed. \n \n     (2) A claim presented in a second or \nsuccessive habeas corpus application \nunder \nsection \n2254 \nthat \nwas \nnot \npresented in a prior application shall be \ndismissed unless\u2014 \n(A) the applicant shows that the \nclaim relies on a new rule of \nconstitutional \nlaw, \nmade \nretroactive to cases on collateral \nreview by the Supreme Court, that \nwas previously unavailable; or \n(B)(i) the factual predicate for the \nclaim \ncould \nnot \nhave \nbeen \ndiscovered previously through the \nexercise of due diligence; and \n     (ii) the facts underlying the \nclaim, if proven and viewed in light \nof the evidence as a whole, would \nbe sufficient to establish by clear \nand convincing evidence that, but \n\n \n3 \n \nfor \nconstitutional \nerror, \nno \nreasonable factfinder would have \nfound the applicant guilty of the \nunderlying offense. \n \n    (3)(A) Before a second or successive \napplication permitted by this section is \nfiled in the district court, the applicant \nshall move in the appropriate court of \nappeals for an order authorizing the \ndistrict court to consider the application. \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE  \n \nA Texas jury found Rivers guilty of one count of \ncontinuous sexual abuse of a young child (Count I), two \ncounts of indecency with a child by contact (Counts II \nand III), one count of indecency with a child by \nexposure (Count IV), and two counts of possession of \nchild pornography (Counts V and VI). Rivers v. State, \nNo. 08-12-00145-CR, 2014 WL 3662569 (Tex. App.\u2014El \nPaso Jul. 23, 2014, pet. ref\u2019d). Rivers received \nsentences of thirty years\u2019 incarceration for Count I, \nthree years\u2019 incarceration each for Counts II and III, \nand two years\u2019 incarceration for Count IV, all to run \nconsecutively. Id.  He received two concurrent two-year \nsentences for Counts V and VI. Id. \n \n \nAfter exhausting his available state remedies, \nRivers first sought federal habeas relief in August \n2017. Pet. App. 2a. The district court entered final \njudgment and denied Rivers\u2019 claims on the merits in \nSeptember 2018. Id. Rivers appealed from the denial, \nand the Fifth Circuit granted a certificate of \nappealability on his claim that his trial counsel was \n\n \n4 \n \nineffective for failing to conduct a reasonable \ninvestigation and interview witnesses. Id. The Fifth \nCircuit ultimately affirmed the district court\u2019s final \njudgment in May 2022. Pet. App. 3a.  \n \n \nBack in February 2021, while the appeal of his first \npetition was still pending, Rivers filed a second petition \nto challenge the same convictions. Pet. App. 2a. In the \nsecond petition, Rivers reasserted that his trial counsel \nwas ineffective and added a myriad of new claims. Id. \nRivers alleged that the new claims arose from \ninformation he gleaned from his attorney-client file, \nwhich he obtained in October 2019. Id. The district \ncourt found that it lacked jurisdiction over this petition \nbecause it was \u201csecond or successive\u201d to his previous \npetition and transferred it to the Fifth Circuit Pet. App. \n12a\u201319a. Pursuant to the transfer order, an original \nproceeding was docketed in the Fifth Circuit for Rivers \nto file a motion for authorization to file a successive \nhabeas petition. See In re Rivers, No. 21-10967 (5th Cir. \nSep. 24, 2021); see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3). Instead of \nmoving for authorization, Rivers filed a notice of appeal \nchallenging the district court\u2019s transfer order and \nurged the Fifth Circuit to construe his second petition \nas a motion to amend his first petition. Pet. App. 3a\u2013\n4a. The Fifth Circuit dismissed the authorization \nproceeding because Rivers never filed a supporting \nmotion. Order, In re Rivers, No. 21-10967 (5th Cir. Nov. \n15, 2021).  \n \n \nThe Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s \ntransfer order on April 15, 2024, holding that the \nsecond petition was successive and thus subject to the \nrequirements of \u00a7 2244. Pet. App. 11a. Rivers now \nseeks certiorari to challenge that decision. \n\n \n5 \n \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe Court Should Deny Certiorari Because \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s Decision Is Consistent \nwith, and Mandated by, This Court\u2019s Cases. \n \nCertiorari is unwarranted. The Fifth Circuit \ncorrectly held that Rivers\u2019 second petition is an \nunauthorized successive petition subject to the \nrequirements of \u00a7 2244(b). See Pet. App. 11a. This \nholding is consistent with Gonzalez and Banister. See \nGonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524 (2005) (holding that a \npost-judgment filing is a successive habeas petition if \nit advances habeas claims); Banister v. Davis, 590 U.S. \n504 (holding that a motion to amend or alter a \njudgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) \nis not successive because it is part of the final judgment \nin the initial habeas proceeding). \n \n \nThe restrictions on \u201csecond or successive\u201d federal \nhabeas petitions in \u00a7 2244(b) apply to Rivers\u2019 second \npetition because it challenged the same six-count \njudgment of conviction as his initial petition. See \nMagwood v. Patterson, 561 U.S. 320, 331 (2010) \n(holding that \u00a7 2244(b) applies \u201conly to a \u2018second or \nsuccessive\u2019 application challenging the same state-\ncourt judgment.\u201d). The Fifth Circuit properly relied on \nthis Court\u2019s analysis in Gonzalez to determine whether \nRivers\u2019 post-judgment \u201cmotion to amend\u201d his initial \nhabeas petition, i.e., his second habeas petition, was \n\u201csecond or successive\u201d to his initial habeas petition \nunder \u00a7 2244(b). Pet. App. 9a\u201310a (citing Gonzalez, 545 \nU.S. at 531\u201332). The court below found Rivers\u2019 second \npetition to be successive because it was a post-\njudgment filing that advanced habeas claims. Pet. App. \n\n \n6 \n \n9a\u201310a (\u201c[F]ilings introduced after a final judgment \nthat raise habeas claims, no matter how titled, are \ndeemed successive\u201d) (citing Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 531\u2013\n32). Chronology does not end the inquiry, however, as \nthis Court has clarified that not all habeas filings made \nafter an initial application qualify as \u201csecond or \nsuccessive.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 511\u201312; Magwood, \n561 U.S. at 332; Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U.S. 930, \n944 (2007).  \n \n \nThus, relying on Gonzalez, the Fifth Circuit \nproperly looked \u201cat the nature of the relief sought rather \nthan the filing\u2019s label to determine whether failing to \nsubject \n[Rivers\u2019 \nsecond \npetition] \nto \nthe \nsame \nrequirements would be inconsistent with the statute.\u201d \nPet. App. 10a (quoting Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 531) \n(cleaned up) (emphasis added). Although Rivers\u2019 \nsecond petition was characterized as a motion to \namend and not a Rule 60(b) motion, \u201cthat is a \ndistinction without a difference.\u201d Pet. App. 9a\u201310a \n(citing Gonzalez, 545 U.S. 527). His second petition\u2014\nthough \u201ccouched in the language\u201d of a motion to \namend\u2014was properly construed as a successive \npetition because it both \u201cattack[ed] the federal court\u2019s \nresolution of [his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel] \nclaim on the merits\u201d by raising ineffective assistance of \ncounsel yet again and \u201csought to add [] new grounds for \nrelief.\u201d Pet. App. 10a (citing Gonzalez, 545 U.S. 531\u2013\n32). AEDPA afforded Rivers one chance to challenge \nhis convictions, and he availed of that chance with his \ninitial habeas petition. See Magwood, 561 U.S. at 333\u2013\n34. The court below rightly relied on Gonzalez and saw \nRivers\u2019 second petition for what it was: an attempted \nsecond bite of the proverbial apple and thus subject to \nauthorization requirements of \u00a7 2244(b). The transfer \n\n \n7 \n \norder was not only correct; it was mandated. Failure to \nread Rivers\u2019 second petition in tandem with \u00a7 2244 \nwould have \u201ccircumvent[ed] the requirement that a \nsuccessive habeas petition be precertified by the court \nof appeals as falling within an exception to the \nsuccessive-petition bar.\u201d See Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 532 \n(citation and internal quotation omitted). \n \n \nRivers\u2019 complaint that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision \n\u201cignores this Court\u2019s guidance in Banister\u201d is wholly \nnon-sequitur. Pet. Cert. 13. As in Gonzalez, the final \njudgment of the initial habeas proceeding is the crux of \nthe inquiry in Banister. The Court explicitly \ndistinguished a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend a \njudgment as not subject to \u00a7 2244(b) because the \nmotion suspends the finality of the judgment, and the \nruling on the motion merges into the final judgment, \nthus ultimately making the Rule 59(e) motion \u201cpart \nand parcel\u201d of the initial habeas proceeding. Banister, \n590 U.S. at 507\u201309. This Court\u2019s holding in Gonzalez \nthat a post-judgment filing \u201ccounts as a second or \nsuccessive habeas application if it \u2018attacks the federal \ncourt\u2019s previous resolution of a claim on the merits\u2019 . . . \ndoes not alter that conclusion.\u201d Id. at 505 (citing \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. 532).  \n \n \nLike a Rule 60(b) motion that advances habeas \nclaims and would thus unequivocally count as a \nsuccessive petition, Rivers\u2019 second petition \u201cdiffers \nfrom a Rule 59(e) [motion] in just about every way that \nmatters to the inquiry here.\u201d See Banister, 590 U.S. at \n516. That is, Rivers\u2019 second petition is unlike a Rule \n59(e) motion in timing, scope, and procedural posture. \nA Rule 59(e) motion must be brought within 28 days of \nfinal judgment and requests only \u201creconsideration of \n\n \n8 \n \nmatters properly encompassed\u201d in the challenged \njudgment. Id. at 516. It is a \u201cone-time effort to bring \nalleged errors in a just-issued decision to a habeas \ncourt\u2019s attention, before taking a single appeal.\u201d Id. \nDespite Rivers\u2019 wishes, his second petition cannot be \ntreated akin to a Rule 59(e) motion as \u201cpart and parcel\u201d \nof his initial habeas proceeding because it was: (1) filed \nin a new, separately numbered district court \nproceeding; (2) more than 28 days after final judgment; \nand (3) exceeded the scope of claims that were raised \nin his initial petition. \n \n \nIn sum, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision comports with \nboth Gonzalez and Banister. Certiorari is unwarranted \nbecause this Court has provided sufficient guidance as \nto what constitutes a successive petition, and the lower \ncourt\u2019s analysis correctly relied on that guidance. The \nonly legally available way to merge Rivers\u2019 new habeas \nclaims \ninto \nhis \nfirst-in-time \npetition\u2019s \nalready \ncompleted judgment is a Rule 60(b) motion, which this \nCourt in Gonzalez already established would be a \nsuccessive petition. \n \nII. \nThe Court Should Deny Certiorari Because \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s Decision Is Consistent \nwith AEDPA\u2019s Aims. \n \nRivers argues that the lower court was wrong \nbecause its approach \u201cwould frustrate AEDPA\u2019s aims.\u201d \nPet. Cert. 27. His arguments have no force because he \ndisregards Congress\u2019 intent in enacting \u00a7 2244(b). \nOddly enough, Rivers faults the Fifth Circuit for not \nasking whether his filing \u201cwould have constituted an \nabuse of the writ,\u201d as the historical doctrine is \nexplained in Banister. Pet. Cert. 30 (citing Banister, \n\n \n9 \n \n590 U.S. at 512) (cleaned up). In doing so, Rivers \nsuggests that the abuse-of-the-writ doctrine should \nsupplant \u00a7 2244(b) as gatekeeper. However, this Court \nhas previously explained that the text of AEDPA as \nwritten\u2014and not pre-AEDPA doctrines like abuse of \nthe writ\u2014controls whether a filing is successive. See \nMagwood, 561 U.S. at 338 (\u201cIn light of this complex \nhistory of the phrase \u2018second or successive,\u2019 we must \nrely upon the current text to determine when the \nphrase applies, rather than pre-AEDPA precedents or \nsuperseded statutory formulations.\u201d).  \n \n \nMoreover, the debate over AEDPA reveals that \nCongress likely intended to override the pre-AEDPA \nlegal standards such as abuse of the writ. See, e.g., 141 \nCong. Rec. 15047 (1995) (\u201cWe are into that school that \nsays . . . drastically curtail the time within which \nsomeone is able to file a habeas petition and how many \ntimes they are able to file one and what constitutes a \nsuccessive petition\u201d); accord id. at 15054\u2013055 (\u201c[S]ome \nreform of habeas corpus is necessary. . . . I support \nlimits on successive, repetitive petitions.\u201d). The \nhistorical \nabuse-of-the-writ \ndoctrine \n\u201cwas \nmore \nforgiving than AEDPA\u2019s gatekeeping provision\u201d to the \nextent that successive petitions were a persistent, \nrecurring issue prior to AEDPA\u2019s enactment. See \nBanister, 590 U.S. at 514 (citing McCleskey v. Zant, 499 \nU.S. 467, 485 (1991)); 141 Cong. Rec. 15039 (\u201c[T]he \ncourt as well as the Congress has found that the writs \nof habeas corpus . . . the petition, more accurately, \nseeking a writ, has been used excessively. This has \nbeen happening for many, many years.\u201d). It thus \nfollows that more stringent amendment to \u00a7 2244(b) \nwas Congress\u2019 solution to curtail the problem of \nsuccessive habeas petitions, to serve as gatekeeper \n\n \n10 \n \nwhere the abuse-of-the-writ doctrine failed. The Fifth \nCircuit did not consider whether Rivers\u2019 second \npetition constituted abuse of the writ because the text \nof \u00a7 2244, not abuse of the writ, was the relevant \ninquiry. \n \nA. Congress determined that the application \nof AEDPA\u2019s successive bar conserves \njudicial \nresources, \nwhile \npre-AEDPA \ndoctrines wasted them. \n \nRivers suggests that the procedural impediments of \n\u00a7 2244(b) are, in of themselves, inefficient at conserving \njudicial resources. See Pet. Cert. 27\u201330 (\u201cIf section \n2244(b)(2) is a \u2018rock[y]\u2019 path for prisoners, that goes \ndouble for courts.\u201d) (quoting Banister, 590 U.S. at 509). \nIn other words, he suggests that the plain text of \n\u00a7 2244(b) should not control because the historical pre-\nAEDPA doctrines such as abuse of the writ better \nconserved judicial resources. See id. at 30 (\u201cHad \nCongress wanted all post-judgment habeas filings to \ncount as second or successive petitions, it easily could \nhave written such a law. But it\u2019s hard to squeeze that \nrule from the text of \u00a7 2244(b)(2) and the history \nagainst which it was written.\u201d).  \n \nBut Rivers\u2019 argument is inapposite, because \nCongress concluded that the pre-AEDPA legal \nstandards were inefficient and wasted judicial \nresources. Rivers cannot take issue with Congress\u2019 \npolicy determinations, and neither should the Court. \nSee Felker v. Turpin, 518 U.S. 651, 664 (1996) (\u201c[W]e \nhave likewise recognized that judgments about the \nproper scope of the writ are normally for Congress to \nmake.\u201d). Furthermore, Rivers ignores the fact that a \n\n \n11 \n \ncircuit court\u2019s authorization decision is not itself an \n\u201cappeal,\u201d and cannot be further appealed, either en \nbanc or to this Court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(E) (\u201cThe \ngrant or denial of an authorization by a court of appeals \nto file a second or successive application shall not be \nappealable and shall not be the subject of a petition for \nrehearing or for a writ of certiorari.\u201d). Because this \nlimitation represents the \u201cmaximum\u201d conservation of \njudicial resources, as contemplated by Congress, \nRivers\u2019 arguments necessarily expend more judicial \nresources in comparison. \n \n \nMoreover, it cannot follow that the district court \nshould have issued an indicative ruling on his second \npetition under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62.1 if \nit found that Rivers \u201cnew evidence was [not] worth the \ncandle.\u201d Pet. Cert. 29 (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 62.1). It \nwas the prerogative of the Fifth Circuit to assess the \nbasis of Rivers\u2019 new claims, had he complied with \nAEDPA\u2019s mandate that he move for authorization. See \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b). Such an analysis under \u00a7 2244(b) \nsupplants the ruling Rivers desired under Rule 62.1. \nAs this Court in Banister admonished, the restrictions \nof \u00a7 2244(b), \u201clike all statutes and rules pertaining to \nhabeas, trump any \u2018inconsistent\u2019 Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure \notherwise \napplicable \nto \nhabeas \nproceedings.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 509. This \nargument, too, falters. \n \n \n\n \n12 \n \nB. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s application of \u00a7 2244(b) \ndecreases piecemeal litigation.  \n \n \nRivers argues that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s approach \nincreases piecemeal litigation because the district \ncourt should have considered his second petition on the \nmerits rather than transfer it to the Fifth Circuit. Pet. \nCert. 29. Rivers again suggests that the procedural \nimpediments \nof \n\u00a7 \n2244(b) \nthemselves \npromote \npiecemeal litigation. First, Rivers\u2019 argument fails to \nacknowledge that the district court lacked authority to \nreopen the judgment while the denial of his first \npetition remained pending on appeal because it had no \njurisdiction to consider an \u201camended\u201d petition. Second, \nthe only way Rivers could have reopened the judgment \nto amend his first petition more than 28 days after final \njudgment would have been a Rule 60(b) motion, which \nwould be plainly successive under Gonzalez because it \nincreases piecemeal litigation.   \n \nC. Congress intended for AEDPA and its \nsuccessive bar to promote finality.  \n \n \nRivers argues that if the evidence that formed the \nbasis of his new claims \u201cisn\u2019t the bombshell that Rivers \nreckons,\u201d the district court should have denied the \nclaims in his second petition on the merits. Pet. Cert. \n29 (\u201cHad it done that, this case would be over.\u201d). But \nbecause the district court lacked jurisdiction to \nconsider the second petition, \u00a7 2244(b) required that \nthe court transfer it to the Fifth Circuit. Yet again, he \nsuggests that the procedural requirements of \u00a7 2244(b) \nare themselves impediments to conviction finality. Id. \nat 29\u201330 (\u201cInstead, the lower courts sent Rivers and \nTexas down a path that could prolong this case.\u201d).  \n\n \n13 \n \n \nIn enacting \u00a7 2244(b), Congress \u201caimed to prevent \nserial challenges to a judgment of conviction.\u201d Banister, \n590 U.S. at 515. Yet Rivers\u2019 proposed approach would \nallow petitioners to make an infinite number of post-\njudgment \u201camendments\u201d to an initial petition so long \nas that petition remains pending on appeal. See id. at \n521. Allowing petitioners to raise habeas claims ad \ninfinitum during the post-judgment pendency of the \ninitial petition runs contrary to \u00a7 2244(b)\u2019s purpose to \n\u201c\u2018conserve judicial resources, reduc[e] piecemeal \nlitigation,\u2019 and \u2018lend[ ] finality to state court judgments \nwithin a reasonable time.\u2019\u201d Id. at 512 (citing Panetti, \n551 U.S. at 945\u201346). In sum, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision \nbelow aligns with AEDPA and Congress\u2019 intent \ntherein. \n \nIII. \nThe Decision Below Is Fully Consistent \nwith the Majority of Circuit Courts to Have \nAddressed This Issue; the Court Should \nDeny Certiorari to Allow the Minority \nCircuits to Self-Correct. \n \nThe rule followed by the majority of circuits is \ncorrect, for the reasons explained above. The Fifth \nCircuit, along with the Fourth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, \nand Eleventh Circuits, all agree that an initial habeas \nproceeding is \u201cconcluded\u201d once the district court has \nissued a final judgment, regardless of a pending \nappeal; any later attempts to advance habeas claims \nare deemed successive under \u00a7 2244(b). See Bixby v. \nStirling, 90 F.4th 140 (4th Cir. 2024); Phillips v. United \nStates, 668 F.3d 433, 435 (7th Cir. 2012); Williams v. \nNorris, 461 F.3d 999, 1003 (8th Cir. 2006); Beaty v. \nSchriro, 554 F.3d 780, 783 n.1 (9th Cir. 2009); Ochoa v. \nSirmons, 485 F.3d 538, 540 (10th Cir. 2007); Boyd v. \n\n \n14 \n \nSec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corr., 114 F.4th 1232, 1239 (11th Cir. \n2024). \n \n \nThe Fourth and Eleventh Circuits most recently \nissued clear decisions aligning with the majority view. \nBixby, 90 F.4th at 146\u201350 (relying on Gonzalez, the \nFourth Circuit determined this year that under \nAEDPA, only it may authorize a second or successive \nhabeas petition); Boyd, 114 F.4th at 1239 (finding that, \neven if filed during an appeal for an adjudicated \n\u201cearlier application,\u201d a habeas petition or motion \u201cthat \npresents new evidence in support of a claim\u201d should be \ndeemed \nsuccessive \nand \n\u201c\u2018treated \naccordingly.\u2019\u201d) \n(quoting Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 531). This position\u2014\nthat upon a final judgment by the district court, if a \npetitioner wishes to present new claims or new \nevidence for old claims during the pendency of an \nappeal, AEDPA grants only the circuit courts the \npower to authorize. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). \n \n \nThe Seventh Circuit, along with the Eighth and \nNinth, have had long-standing views on this issue, \nfinding that upon an appeal, a habeas petitioner\u2019s \nadditional claims would be successive. Phillips, 668 \nF.3d at 435; Williams v. Norris, 461 F.3d at 1003; Beaty \nv. Schriro, 554 F.3d at 783 n.1. As the Seventh Circuit \nwarned, ruling otherwise would allow a petitioner to \n\u201cfile[] an entirely independent \u00a7 2255 petition raising a \ndistinct claim of relief; indeed, he could still file one or \nmore, as many as he likes, because this appeal is not \nover.\u201d Phillips, 668 F.3d at 435. As such, \u201c[t]reating \nmotions filed during appeal as part of the original \napplication,\u201d would potentially \u201cdrain most force from \nthe time-and-number limits,\u201d of AEDPA. Id. A district \n\n \n15 \n \ncourt\u2019s final judgment, therefore, must \u201cmark[] the \nterminal point.\u201d Id. \n \n \nBy contrast, only the Second and Third Circuits \nhave ruled that a petition is not successive if filed \nduring the pendency of the initial petition\u2019s appeal.  \nWhab v. United States, 408 F.3d 116, 118 (2d Cir. \n2005); United States v. Santarelli, 929 F.3d 95, 106 (3d \nCir. 2019) (holding that a prior proceeding has not \nconcluded for purposes of \u00a7 2244(b) until all appeals \nhave been exhausted.).  \n \n \nTo strengthen his circuit-split argument, Rivers \nasserts that the Tenth Circuit applies a \u201cseven-factor \ntest\u201d to determine if a petitioner may supplement an \ninitial petition before the district court rendered \njudgment. Pet. Cert. 19\u201320. In Douglas v. Workman, \n560 F.3d 1156 (10th Cir. 2009), the Tenth Circuit \ncarved out an exception for prosecutorial misconduct \nclaims to its normal rule concerning AEDPA\u2019s bar of \nsuccessive petitions. Specifically, when the \u201cprosecutor \nacted \nwillfully, \nand \nnot \njust \nnegligently \nor \ninadvertently, \nhis \nconduct \nwarrants \nspecial \ncondemnation and justifies permitting [the petitioner] \nto supplement his initial habeas petition.\u201d Id. at 1190. \nThat court then laid out \u201cseven factors on which [it \nbased \nits] \nconclusion\u201d \nthat \na \npetitioner \nmay \nsupplement. Id. at 1190\u201396. But to be clear, the Tenth \nCircuit has explicitly declined to follow the Second \nCircuit\u2019s position detailed in Whab, 408 F.3d 116, for \nmost second petitions filed during the appeal of the \ninitial habeas petition. Ochoa, 485 F.3d at 540. Indeed, \nthe Tenth Circuit stated that the minority rule \u201cwould \ngreatly undermine the policy against piecemeal \nlitigation embodied in \u00a7 2244(b).\u201d Id. \n\n \n16 \n \n \nNevertheless, there is a mature circuit split on \nwhether \u00a7 2244(b) applies to post-judgment motions \nfiled when the initial habeas application is pending on \nappeal. Moreover, this is a jurisdictional question, and \nthis Court has repeatedly described the importance of \nclear jurisdictional rules. See, e.g., Lapides v. Bd. of \nRegents of Univ. Sys. Of Georgia, 535 U.S. 613, 621 \n(2002). Thus, this could be a sufficient basis to justify \ncertiorari, even if only to affirm the majority rule. \n \n \nOn the other hand, the circuits are not \u201cintractably\u201d \nsplit as Rivers claims, nor is it certain that \u201cthe conflict \nwon\u2019t disappear on its own.\u201d See Pet. Cert. 2. Even \nlooking at Rivers\u2019 assertions more favorably, all of the \ncourts that do or could take the minority view\u2014the \nSecond, Third, and Tenth Circuits\u2014lacked the \nguidance and historical examination of AEDPA from \nthis Court\u2019s intervening decision in Banister. See, e.g., \nWhab, 408 F.3d at 118 (decided fifteen years prior to \nBanister); Santarelli, 929 F.3d at 106 (decided one year \nprior); Douglas, 560 F.3d at 1196 (decided eleven years \nprior). Certiorari is unwarranted at this stage because \nthe minority circuits have yet to self-correct. This \nCould should grant certiorari only if they fail to do so \nat the next opportunity. \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nBased on the foregoing reasons, the petition for a \nwrit of certiorari should be denied. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n17 \n \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \nKEN PAXTON \n \nAttorney General of Texas \n \n \n \nBRENT WEBSTER \n \nFirst Assistant Attorney \n \nGeneral \n \n \n \nJOSH RENO \n \nDeputy Attorney General for \n \nCriminal Justice \n \n \n \nEDWARD L.

He doesn\u2019t deny that this case is the ideal vehicle \nfor resolving it. And he admits that the conflict has \ndeepened even while this case has been pending. Ten \ncircuits have now splintered four ways over when 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2)\u2019s gatekeeping requirements for \n\u201csecond or successive\u201d habeas petitions kick in, and \nthe question is ripe for review.  \nLumpkin\u2019s only response is that the circuits are not \n\u201cintractably\u201d split because the Second, Third, and \nTenth might still \u201cself-correct\u201d in light of Banister v. \nDavis, 590 U.S. 504 (2020). Opp. 16. But those courts \nhave already had\u2014and rejected\u2014multiple opportuni-\nties to do so. Only this Court can resolve the conflict, \nand there is no reason to stay on the sidelines. \nWith nowhere else to turn, Lumpkin spends most of \nhis brief on the merits\u2014but none of his arguments \nmakes this case any less certworthy. Gonzalez v. \nCrosby, 545 U.S. 524 (2005), doesn\u2019t \u201cmandat[e]\u201d the \noutcome because that case did not implicate the tim-\ning question posed here. Contra Opp. 7. Nor can the \ndecision below be squared with Banister. Like the \nFifth Circuit, Lumpkin sidesteps historical habeas \npractice, and he offers no serious answer on AEDPA\u2019s \npurposes. Finally, Lumpkin is also wrong that Rule \n60(b) was Rivers\u2019s only path to relief. Even while an \nappeal is pending, a district court retains jurisdiction \nto issue an indicative ruling about new exculpatory \nevidence. Section 2244(b)(2) doesn\u2019t supplant Rule \n62.1 any more than it does Rule 59(e). \nThis case is the perfect opportunity to resolve an \nimportant question. The Court should grant review. \n\n2 \n \n \nI. Respondent concedes that the 7-1-1-1  \ncircuit split is certworthy. \nA.  Lumpkin admits \u201cthere is a mature circuit split\u201d \non the question presented, which \u201ccould be a suffi-\ncient basis to justify certiorari.\u201d Opp. 16. He\u2019s right. \nIn the Second Circuit, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) does not apply un-\ntil a prisoner exhausts appellate review of his first \nhabeas petition. In seven other circuits, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) \nkicks in once the district court enters final judgment \nor shortly thereafter. (Even those courts can\u2019t agree \non when.) In the Tenth Circuit, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies \neven sooner\u2014unless the prisoner satisfies a seven-\nfactor test. And in the Third Circuit, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) tog-\ngles on and off depending on who wins the appeal. \nSee Pet. 13\u201320. In short: the circuits are in shambles, \nand this Court\u2019s intervention is badly needed. \nThe split is now even deeper than it was when this \ncase started. As Lumpkin concedes (at 14), \u201c[t]he \nFourth and Eleventh Circuits [have] recently issued \nclear decisions\u201d deepening the conflict. Opp. 14. In \nBixby v. Stirling, 90 F.4th 140, 143, 145 (4th Cir. \n2024), the petitioner sought further habeas relief \nwhile the \u201cappeal from the denial of his [first] petition \nwas pending.\u201d The Fourth Circuit rejected that filing \nas a \u201csecond or successive\u201d petition, deepening the \nconflict. And the Eleventh Circuit, which had previ-\nously addressed the issue only in unpublished orders, \njust solidified the split in a published opinion. Citing \nthe decision below, it \u201cjoin[ed] the majority of \u2026 cir-\ncuits\u201d and expressly \u201cdisagree[d]\u201d with the Second \nCircuit\u2019s approach. Boyd v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corr., 114 \nF.4th 1232, 1238 & n.3 (11th Cir. 2024). \nB.  Split conceded, Lumpkin offers just one reason \nto punt: that \u201cthe minority circuits\u201d might still \u201cself-\ncorrect\u201d in light of Banister. Opp. 16. In his view, \n\n3 \n \n \n\u201c[t]his Court should grant certiorari only if they fail \nto do so at the next opportunity.\u201d Id. What Lumpkin \ndoesn\u2019t mention, however, is that those courts have \nalready had the chance to \u201cself-correct\u201d\u2014and they\u2019ve \npassed. Just a few weeks ago, the Third Circuit dou-\nbled down on its approach in an opinion citing Banis-\nter. See Ross v. Adm\u2019r E. Jersey State Prison, No. 23-\n1240, 2024 WL 4341335, at *6 (3d Cir. Sept. 30, \n2024). And the Second Circuit has also stuck to its \nguns. See Waiters v. United States, No. 20-2712, 2021 \nWL 11096770, at *1 (2d Cir. May 19, 2021) (continu-\ning to apply Whab v. United States, 408 F.3d 116 (2d \nCir. 2005)). \n* \n* \n* \nTen circuits have now split four ways over the \nquestion presented. The conflict is entrenched and \nwon\u2019t fix itself. And with roughly 99% of prisoners \nnow covered by the split, there is no reason for this \nCourt to wait any longer. See Fed. Bureau of Prisons, \nStatistics, bit.ly/Federal-Prisons; Prison Pol\u2019y Initia-\ntive, Appendix: State and Federal Prison Populations \n2019-2023, bit.ly/State-Prisons. It\u2019s high time to re-\nsolve this question once and for all. \nII. Respondent doesn\u2019t deny that this case is \nthe ideal vehicle to resolve a critically im-\nportant habeas question. \nA.  Lumpkin admits that the question presented is \nimportant. See Opp. 16 (conceding the \u201cimportance of \nclear jurisdictional rules\u201d). Rivers\u2019s amici agree. The \nNation\u2019s leading habeas scholars have explained how \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s rule \u201cleads to perverse results\u201d and \ncould \u201cbar potentially meritorious habeas claims.\u201d \nScholars Br. 13. The National Association of Criminal \nDefense Lawyers, the Innocence Project, and the \n\n4 \n \n \nFederal Public Defenders have warned that \u201can en-\ntire subset of Brady and ineffective assistance claims\u201d \nmay fall through the cracks. NACDL Br. 14. And \nnearly a dozen of this Court\u2019s former Article III col-\nleagues have urged it to grant review because \u201cthe \nmajority rule unduly burdens courts.\u201d Judges Br. 6.  \nB.  Lumpkin also doesn\u2019t deny that \u201cthis case is an \nideal vehicle.\u201d Pet. 3. The question presented is out-\ncome-determinative. No factual disputes will hinder \nreview. See Opp. 3\u20134. And\u2014unlike most habeas peti-\ntioners\u2014Rivers meticulously preserved all of his ar-\nguments below. No wonder Lumpkin doesn\u2019t dispute \nthat \u201cRivers will have a meaningful path to relief\u201d if \nthis Court reverses. Pet. 31. It\u2019s hard to imagine a \nbetter vehicle for addressing the question presented. \nIII. The decision below is wrong. \nA.  Section 2244(b)(2) does not strip district courts \nof jurisdiction to consider all habeas filings submitted \nwhile an initial petition is on appeal. In holding oth-\nerwise, the Fifth Circuit failed to cite Banister\u2014much \nless follow the roadmap that it lays out. Had it done \nso, the court would have realized that its ruling \ndoesn\u2019t square with either \u201chistorical precedents\u201d or \n\u201cstatutory aims.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 513. As to his-\ntory, early cases suggest that filings submitted while \nan initial habeas application is on appeal are not \n\u201csecond or successive.\u201d See Pet. 25\u201327; Scholars Br. \n6\u201313. And as to purposes, treating filings like Rivers\u2019s \nas \u201csecond or successive\u201d would frustrate\u2014not fur-\nther\u2014judicial economy, efficiency, and finality. See \nPet. 27\u201330; Judges Br. 7\u20138. The Fifth Circuit consid-\nered none of this, and its categorical rule can\u2019t be \nsquared with this Court\u2019s cases. \nB.  Lumpkin\u2019s responses don\u2019t wash. \n\n5 \n \n \n1.  Lumpkin chiefly argues (at 7\u20138) that cert isn\u2019t \nwarranted because Gonzalez \u201cmandated\u201d the outcome \nbelow and offers \u201csufficient guidance as to what con-\nstitutes a successive petition.\u201d That\u2019s doubly wrong. \nFor one thing, even if Lumpkin were right and \nGonzalez controlled, the lower courts are still in dis-\narray over how to apply its \u201cguidance.\u201d Contra Opp. \n7. The Fifth Circuit gleaned from Gonzalez the \u201cun-\nderlying principle\u201d that habeas filings \u201cintroduced af-\nter a final judgment \u2026 are deemed successive.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 10a. Other courts beg to differ. See, e.g., Doug-\nlas v. Workman, 560 F.3d 1156, 1190, 1193 (10th Cir. \n2009) (citing Gonzalez and adopting seven-factor \ntest); Moreland v. Robinson, 813 F.3d 315, 322\u201324 \n(6th Cir. 2016) (citing Gonzalez and pegging \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2) to the window for appeal); United States \nv. Santarelli, 929 F.3d 95, 105 (3d Cir. 2019) (pegging \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2) to exhaustion and stating that Gonzalez \n\u201cdoes not compel a different result\u201d). That alone war-\nrants review. \nBut Lumpkin isn\u2019t right: \u201cGonzalez does not answer \nthe question whether a [mid-appeal habeas filing] is a \n\u2018second or successive\u2019 habeas application under \n\u00a7 2244(b).\u201d Balbuena v. Sullivan, 970 F.3d 1176, 1200 \n(9th Cir. 2020) (Fletcher, J., concurring in the result). \nHow could it? The petitioner in Gonzalez sought relief \nmore than a year after his appeal ended, and his fil-\ning did not present a habeas claim in the first place. \nSee Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 527, 533 & n.6; Scholars \nBr. 23. So the \u201cgeneral expressions\u201d Lumpkin cites \ncan hardly \u201ccontrol the judgment in a subsequent suit \nwhen the very point is presented for decision.\u201d Co-\nhens v. Virginia, 19 U.S. (6 Wheat.) 264, 399 (1821).  \n2.  Turning to Banister, Lumpkin insists that the \ndecision below is \u201cconsistent with\u201d this Court\u2019s guid-\n\n6 \n \n \nance. Opp. 5. But he has no sound answer to the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s failure to cite Banister, and his efforts to de-\nfend that court\u2019s reasoning fall flat. \na.  Lumpkin concedes (at 10) that the Fifth Circuit \n\u201cdid not consider\u201d whether Rivers\u2019s filing \u201cwould have \n\u2018constituted an abuse of the writ, as that concept is \nexplained in [this Court\u2019s] pre-AEDPA cases.\u2019\u201d Banis-\nter, 590 U.S. at 512. Neither does Lumpkin.  \nInstead, he principally contends that the Fifth Cir-\ncuit was right to ignore that question because \u201cthe \ntext of \u00a7 2244, not abuse of the writ, [i]s the relevant \ninquiry.\u201d Opp. 10. That misses the point. No one \ndoubts that \u201cthe text of AEDPA \u2026 controls,\u201d nor does \nanyone think historical practice \u201cshould supplant \n\u00a7 2244(b) as gatekeeper.\u201d Contra Opp. 9. This Court \nlooked to \u201chistorical habeas doctrine and practice\u201d in \nBanister because \u201c[t]he phrase \u2018second or successive \nhabeas corpus application\u2019 \u2026 is a \u2018term of art\u2019 that \u2018is \nnot self-defining.\u2019\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 511 (quoting \nSlack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 486 (2000)). In other \nwords, historical practice matters precisely because \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2) \u201ctakes its full meaning from [the Court\u2019s] \ncase law.\u201d Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U.S. 930, 943 \n(2007). Ignoring that is a telltale sign that the Fifth \nCircuit (and Lumpkin) have taken a wrong turn.  \nAfter thumbing his nose at historical practice, \nLumpkin pivots to a source that Banister did not con-\nsult: legislative history. Citing a handful of floor \nstatements, Lumpkin declares that \u201cCongress likely \nintended\u201d to \u201ccurtail the problem of successive habeas \npetitions\u201d by \u201coverrid[ing] \u2026 pre-AEDPA legal stand-\nards.\u201d Opp. 9. \u201cWell, yes, but so what?\u201d Pulsifer v. \nUnited States, 601 U.S. 124, 135 n.3 (2024). Banister \nalready confirmed that AEDPA \u201cdid not redefine\u201d the \n\n7 \n \n \nstandard that matters here: \u201cwhat qualifies as a suc-\ncessive petition.\u201d 590 U.S. at 515.  \nIn all events, the legislative history doesn\u2019t favor \nLumpkin. As then-Chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee Orrin Hatch explained, AEDPA was in-\ntended to \u201cguarantee prisoners one complete and fair \ncourse of collateral review in the Federal System.\u201d \nFederal Habeas Corpus Reform: Eliminating Prison-\ners\u2019 Abuse of the Judicial Process: Hearing on S. 623 \nBefore the S. Comm. on the Judiciary, 104th Cong. 2, \n3 (1995) (emphasis added). That meant \u201cone full \ncourse of litigation up to the Supreme Court.\u201d Judi-\ncial Conference of the United States, Ad Hoc Comm. \non Fed. Habeas Corpus in Capital Cases, Comm. Re-\nport and Proposal (Lewis F. Powell, Jr., Chairman, \nAug. 23, 1989), reprinted in Habeas Corpus Reform: \nHearings Before the S. Comm. on the Judiciary, 101st \nCong. 7\u201330 (1991). It follows that \u201ca subsequent fil-\ning\u201d is not \u201c\u2018second or successive\u2019 \u2026 simply because \nthe district court rendered a [final] judgment.\u201d Ching \nv. United States, 298 F.3d 174, 178 (2d Cir. 2002)  \n(Sotomayor, J.).   \nb.  Lumpkin fares no better when he turns to Ban-\nister\u2019s other source of guidance, AEDPA\u2019s purposes. \nLumpkin begins (at 10) by chiding Rivers for \n\u201ctak[ing] issue with Congress\u2019 policy determinations\u201d \nand for quibbling with \u201cthe procedural impediments \nof \u00a7 2244(b) \u2026 in [and] of themselves.\u201d Not at all. \nEveryone agrees that petitions filed after the prisoner \nexhausts appellate review of his initial application \ncount as second or successive and are channeled \nthrough the court of appeals. See Pet. 27. The ques-\ntion here is whether \u00a7 2244(b)(2) also governs a filing \nlike Rivers\u2019s\u2014i.e., one submitted while the initial ap-\nplication is pending on appeal. As the petition ex-\n\n8 \n \n \nplained (at 27\u201330), \u201cAEDPA\u2019s own purposes\u201d suggest \nthat the answer is no. Banister, 590 U.S. at 512. By \ninvoking \u201cCongress\u2019 policy determinations,\u201d however, \nLumpkin merely begs the question. Opp. 10. \nTurning to the merits, Lumpkin warns that Riv-\ners\u2019s approach would waste \u201cjudicial resources\u201d and \npermit \u201can infinite number of post-judgment amend-\nments.\u201d Opp. 11, 13. But the Second Circuit has ap-\nplied the rule that Rivers advocates for nearly two \ndecades. So if Lumpkin is right, it\u2019s fair to ask why he \ndoesn\u2019t cite a single example of the abuses he fears. \nHis failure to do so suggests that district courts have \nall the tools they need to serve as effective gatekeep-\ners. See Whab, 408 F.3d at 119 n.2 (\u201cTraditional doc-\ntrines, such as abuse of the writ, continue to apply.\u201d); \nChing, 298 F.3d at 180 (\u201c[T]he decision to grant a mo-\ntion to amend is committed to the sound discretion of \nthe district court.\u201d); NACDL Br. 19\u201321. Nearly a doz-\nen \u201cformer judges who have dealt with numerous fil-\nings by habeas petitioners in both district and appel-\nlate roles\u201d agree. Judges Br. 7. In their experience, \n\u201cdistrict courts are best positioned to deal with and \ndispose of these types of post-appeal filings, and can \nreadily handle them using tools already at their dis-\nposal without resort to\u201d \u00a7 2244(b)(2). Id. at 4. \n3.  Finally, Lumpkin is also wrong that Rivers\u2019s on-\nly path to relief \u201cwould have been a Rule 60(b) mo-\ntion.\u201d Opp. 12. True, the district court \u201chad no juris-\ndiction to consider an \u2018amended\u2019 petition\u201d while the \ncase was \u201cpending on appeal.\u201d Opp. 12. But even \nwhile \u201can appeal \u2026 is pending,\u201d a district court may \nissue an indicative ruling stating \u201cthat [a] motion \nraises a substantial issue.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 62.1. The \nappellate court may then \u201cremand for further pro-\nceedings.\u201d Fed. R. App. P. 12.1(b). Here, had the dis-\n\n9 \n \n \ntrict court not misread \u00a7 2244(b)(2), it could have con-\nsidered Rivers\u2019s new evidence and (if warranted) \nstated that \u201cit would grant the motion if the court of \nappeals remand[ed].\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 62.1. In that \ncase, an \u201corder for remand would \u2026 amount in itself \nto a vacation of the judgment for further proceedings, \nincluding amendments.\u201d Markert v. Swift & Co., 173 \nF.2d 517, 520 (2d Cir. 1949) (deeming \u201cresort \u2026 to \nRule 60\u201d unnecessary); see also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106 (au-\nthorizing appellate courts to \u201cvacate \u2026 any judg-\nment\u201d and \u201crequire such further proceedings \u2026 as \nmay be just under the circumstances\u201d). \nContra Lumpkin, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) doesn\u2019t \u201csupplan[t]\u201d \nRule 62.1 any more than it does Rule 59(e). Opp. 11. \nLike a Rule 59(e) motion, a Rule 62.1 motion \u201cgives a \nprisoner only a narrow window to ask for relief.\u201d Ban-\nister, 590 U.S. at 516. Should both courts oblige, a \nremand for amendment would be \u201ca limited continua-\ntion of the original proceeding.\u201d Id. at 521. And if the \ndistrict court again denied relief, the prisoner would \n\u201ctak[e] a single appeal.\u201d Id. In short, Rule 59(e) and \nRule 62.1 are alike \u201cin just about every way that mat-\nters.\u201d Id. at 518. The courts below reached none of \nthis because they thought \u00a7 2244(b)(2) strips district \ncourts of jurisdiction to consider any \u201cpost-judgment\u201d \nhabeas filing. Opp. 5. Should this Court reverse, Riv-\ners will be free to seek 62.1 relief on remand. \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should grant the petition. \n \n\n10 \n \n \nRespectfully submitted,  \n \n \nPeter A.

Habeas courts historically enter-\ntained mid-appeal efforts to amend, without a word \nabout successive litigation. Just before Congress en-\nacted \u00a72244(b), Texas itself told this Court why. \nWhen \u201cthere has been no appellate review of the \njudgment of the district court, there is no finality to \nthat court\u2019s review on the merits, and thus [an] \namended petition would not be subject to dismissal \nfor abuse.\u201d Pet\u2019r. Br., McCotter v. Petty, No. 85-1656, \n1986 WL 728550, at *23. \u201cCongress passed AEDPA \nagainst this legal backdrop, and did nothing to \nchange it.\u201d Banister v. Davis, 590 U.S. 504, 515 \n(2020). That should resolve this case. Rivers\u2019s motion \nwas not a second or successive application, and the \nFifth Circuit was wrong to hold otherwise. \nTexas scarcely disputes the meaning of \u00a72244(b). \nInstead, it spends most of its brief arguing that the \nrules of civil procedure do not permit mid-appeal ef-\nforts to amend. Every step of its logic is wrong\u2014but \nRivers can prevail whether or not this Court settles \nthe procedural debate. The courts below made a \nthreshold error about the meaning of \u00a72244(b), and \nthe Court can reverse on that basis alone.  \nWhen Texas does get around to \u00a72244(b), the theory \nit offers is wrong and unworkable. The State under-\nstandably abandons the decision below, which didn\u2019t \neven cite Banister. It then cobbles together a new \ntheory, consisting of one line from Banister and one \nline from Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524 (2005), Br. \n20, plus an ad hoc time-of-appeal rule borrowed from \nthe Sixth Circuit, Br. 28. That approach has no basis \nin text or history, and no other court has found it per-\nsuasive. It also guarantees that this issue will be \n\n2 \n \nback again soon, once the lower courts trip on the \ncracks already evident in Texas\u2019s theory. To save it-\nself time, the Court should reject that theory now. \nFinally, a word to clear the air. \u201cToo much public \ndiscourse today is sullied by ad hominem rhetoric,\u201d \nand Texas \u201cregrettably succumbs to this trend.\u201d Ra-\nmos v. Louisiana, 590 U.S. 83, 141 (2020) (Alito, J., \ndissenting). Presenting \u201cas historical fact the testi-\nmony of the prosecution\u2019s witnesses,\u201d Glossip v. Ok-\nlahoma, 145 S. Ct. 612, 620 n.1 (2025), its brief \nbrands Rivers as an \u201cadmitted\u201d child abuser who has \nspent \u201cthe last thirteen years\u201d seeking to \u201cescape jus-\ntice.\u201d Br. 1. Even if true, that would shed no light on \nthe meaning of \u00a72244(b). But Rivers denies such ad-\nmissions, ROA.1584, and he has presented new evi-\ndence calling his convictions into question. If the \nCourt reverses, those merits issues will be ripe for \nreview. But this case is about \u00a72244(b)\u2014\u201c[s]o all the \ntalk\u201d of escaping justice \u201cis entirely out of place.\u201d \nRamos, 590 U.S. at 143. \nARGUMENT \nI. There is no obstacle to reaching the  \nquestion presented. \nA. This Court has jurisdiction. \nRivers has appellate standing. The district court re-\nfused to consider Rivers\u2019s proposed amendment, mis-\ntakenly holding that \u00a72244(b) stripped it of jurisdic-\ntion. Pet. App. 19a. The Fifth Circuit affirmed. Pet. \nApp. 11a. That judgment injures Rivers because it \nmakes his path to habeas relief \u201crockier.\u201d Banister, \n590 U.S. at 509. \u201cAnd a favorable ruling from this \nCourt would redress [his] injury by reversing that \njudgment.\u201d Food Mktg. Inst. v. Argus Leader Media, \n588 U.S. 427, 432\u201333 (2019).  \n\n3 \n \nNor is the case moot. Texas never explains (at 17) \nwhat \u201cjurisdictional consequences\u201d flow from the \nclerk\u2019s decision to docket Rivers\u2019s proposed amend-\nment as a new case, but that error is easily fixed. On \nremand, Rivers could move to consolidate this case \nwith his original habeas case, where his amendment \nbelonged from the start. Cf. Sherrod v. Am. Airlines, \nInc., 132 F.3d 1112, 1117 (5th Cir. 1998) (after consol-\nidation, \u201call motions filed in the second lawsuit were \ndeemed filed in the consolidated suit\u201d). He could then \nmove under Rule 60(b)(6) for relief from the judgment \ndenying his original habeas application. The grounds \nfor that motion would be integrity-based: that the \ndistrict court\u2019s threshold jurisdictional error, Pet. \nApp. 18a\u201319a, \u201cprecluded\u201d it from considering Riv-\ners\u2019s proposed amendment while the original case \nwas still pending. Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 532 n.4. If \nthe district court granted that motion, Rivers\u2019s origi-\nnal petition would again be pending, and the court \ncould grant leave to amend. See Chafin v. Chafin, 568 \nU.S. 165, 174 (2013) (\u201c[P]rospects of success are \u2026 \nnot pertinent to the mootness inquiry.\u201d). \nThe Court also has habeas jurisdiction. While Riv-\ners has served his child-pornography sentences, he \nremains \u201cin custody\u201d for sexual assault and indecen-\ncy. 28 U.S.C. \u00a72254(a). The proposed amendment \npleads facts that could warrant relief from those con-\nvictions. J.A.68\u201369, 75. Prosecutors used the alleged \nchild pornography to show \u201cmotive,\u201d ROA.733, and \n\u201cconfir[m] what the girls were saying,\u201d ROA.1045, \nand Rivers can argue on remand that the new evi-\ndence would have undermined the State\u2019s case. The \nalleged confession, which jurors never heard, would \nbe immaterial under Strickland and Napue. \n\n4 \n \nB. Rivers\u2019s arguments are properly before \nthe Court. \n1. Rivers\u2019s arguments are fairly included within the \nquestion presented. The paragraph introducing that \nquestion stated that Rivers \u201csought to amend his ini-\ntial habeas application while it was pending on ap-\npeal\u201d and explained that the circuits are split on \n\u201cwhether \u00a72244(b)(2) applies to such filings.\u201d Pet. i. \nThe question then asked whether \u00a72244(b)(2) applies \nto all, some, or no filings submitted between final \njudgment and the end of appellate review. \nOur opening brief offered the Court two ways to an-\nswer that question. Texas concedes that the broader, \ntiming-focused theory\u2014that \u00a72244(b)(2) does not ap-\nply to any mid-appeal habeas filings\u2014is properly be-\nfore the Court and fits squarely within the question \npresented. If that\u2019s true, then so must our amend-\nment theory: that \u00a72244(b)(2) does not apply to some \nmid-appeal filings. The greater (mid-appeal filings) \nincludes the lesser (mid-appeal Rule 15 motions). And \ndeciding the case on that ground would all but resolve \nthe circuit conflict, since most cases in the split in-\nvolved amendments. \n2. Rivers also preserved his amendment theory. \nRivers told the district court that \u00a72244(b)(2) did not \napply because he had filed \u201can amendment to [his] \ninitial petition under Fed. R. Civ. P. 15.\u201d Pet\u2019r. Objec-\ntions, No. 7:21-cv-00012 (N.D. Tex. Sept. 2, 2021), \nDkt. 27, at 8; see also id. at 7\u20138 (applying Rule 15 \nwould not \u201cfrustrate AEDPA\u2019s goals\u201d). He pressed the \nsame argument on appeal, reasoning that \u201ca supple-\nment/amendment should be acceptable under Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 15 and thus the new claims should not be sub-\nject to \u00a72244.\u201d C.A. Br. 8. That\u2019s more than enough to \npreserve the argument that \u00a72244(b) does not apply \n\n5 \n \nto amendments, especially under the relaxed stand-\nards for pro se litigants.  \nThe amendment argument is properly before this \nCourt too. The petition stated that Rivers \u201curg[ed] the \ncourt to construe [his] filing as an amendment ... in-\nstead of a second or successive petition.\u201d Pet. 12. Fol-\nlowing Banister\u2019s logic, it then argued that the lower \ncourts were wrong to apply \u00a72244(b). Compare Pet. \n25\u201326 with Br. 25\u201327 (history), and Pet. 27\u201330 with \nBr. 31\u201335 (purposes). Texas is right that Rivers first \ncited \u00a72242 at the merits stage. But our \u00a72242 argu-\nment is just that: an argument in support of the same \nclaim that Rivers has made all along\u2014that \u00a72244(b) \ndoes not apply. See Yee v. City of Escondido, 503 U.S. \n519, 534 (1992). Texas does not suggest otherwise. In \nall events, this Court \u201cretains the independent power \nto identify and apply the proper construction of gov-\nerning law.\u201d Kamen v. Kemper Fin. Servs., Inc., 500 \nU.S. 90, 99 (1991). \n3. The procedural issues were also on full display \nwhen the Court granted cert. Anticipating Texas\u2019s ob-\njections, our petition explained that Rule 62.1 allows \ndistrict courts to consider mid-appeal filings. See Pet. \n3, 29 (citing case law). Texas responded that \u201cthe only \nway Rivers could have reopened the judgment to \namend\u201d was \u201cRule 60(b).\u201d BIO 12. Our reply showed \nwhy that was wrong\u2014previewing the procedural \npathway set forth in our opening merits brief. See \nReply 9 (citing Rules 62.1 and 12.1, \u00a72106, and case \nlaw). The Court may address these \u201cantecedent\u201d mat-\nters, Arcadia v. Ohio Power Co., 498 U.S. 73, 77 \n(1990), as \u201csubsidiary issues fairly comprised by the \nquestion presented,\u201d City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian \nNation, 544 U.S. 197, 214 n.8 (2005).  \n\n6 \n \nII. A motion to amend or supplement an initial \nhabeas petition that is pending on appeal is \nnot a \u201csecond or successive\u201d application. \nA. A mid-appeal Rule 15 motion is not a \n\u201csecond or successive\u201d application.  \nText. Whatever the phrase \u201csecond or successive \nhabeas corpus application\u201d means, it cannot cover \nmotions to amend. Congress treated \u201csecond or suc-\ncessive application[s]\u201d and \u201camendment[s] to an ap-\nplication\u201d as distinct legal concepts. \u00a72266(b)(2)(B), \n(b)(3)(B). It subjected them to different legal rules. \nSee \u00a72242; \u00a72244(b). And when Congress wanted to \nsubject amendments to the rules governing second or \nsuccessive applications, it said so. See \u00a72266(b)(3)(B). \nAs the United States concedes, all other amendments \n\u201cfollow the Federal Rules,\u201d U.S. Br. 17, so applying \n\u00a72244(b) instead would flout Congress\u2019s drafting \nchoices. Plenty of challenges might await a mid-\nappeal Rule 15 motion, but \u00a72244(b) isn\u2019t one of them. \nTexas fails to answer most of these points. It chiefly \nargues (at 29) that \u00a72242 applies only before final \njudgment, whereas \u00a72244(b) applies after. But the \nstatutes don\u2019t say that, and the \u00a72242 Codifier\u2019s Note \nsuggests otherwise. Congress added the amendment \nprovision to \u201cconform to existing practice,\u201d Codifier\u2019s \nNote, 28 U.S.C. \u00a72242 (1952), and fresh on its mind \nwould have been Price v. Johnston, 334 U.S. 266 \n(1948). After the prisoner there made new factual al-\nlegations in his appellate brief, this Court remanded \nfor \u201camendment or elaboration of [the] pleadings.\u201d Id. \nat 277, 290\u201391. Pre-AEDPA courts continued to en-\ntertain such efforts, and Texas cites no language in \n\u00a72244(b) purporting to \u201caffec[t]\u201d this practice. Contra \nResp. Br. 29. Finally, because amendments and sec-\nond or successive applications are mutually exclusive \ncategories, \u201cthere is no conflict\u201d between \u00a72242(b) and \n\n7 \n \n\u00a72244. Nat\u2019l Cable & Telecomms. Ass\u2019n v. Gulf Power \nCo., 534 U.S. 327, 336 (2002). \nHistory. The history here is even stronger than in \nBanister. Our opening brief cited cases from six cir-\ncuits that addressed mid-appeal efforts to amend \u201con \nthe merits.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 515. Texas\u2019s amici \ncite only one case going the other way\u2014the same los-\ning score as in Banister.  \n1. Texas can\u2019t get around the historical cases that \nentertained mid-appeal motions to amend. \na. Nearly everything Texas says about Harisiades \nv. Shaughnessy is wrong. Had Harisiades just wanted \nto \u201cbuttress\u201d his claims with \u201cintervening authority,\u201d \nBr. 35, he could have done so in an appellate brief. \nInstead, he sought to \u201camend\u201d his \u201cpetition\u201d with new \nfactual allegations supporting a claim under the APA, \nwhich this Court had just held applicable to deporta-\ntion proceedings like his. 90 F. Supp. 431, 432 n.2 \n(S.D.N.Y. 1950). Only later, when the government ar-\ngued that \u201cthe notice of appeal barred the District \nCourt from considering the motion,\u201d did Harisiades \nmove to withdraw his appeal. Id. at 433. Faced with \nthe two motions, the court \u201cfirst consider[ed] the mer-\nits of the original application for leave to amend.\u201d Id. \nat 434. It then spent six pages analyzing \u201cwhether \nthe deportation proceeding was \u2018initiated\u2019 prior to the \n[APA\u2019s] effective date.\u201d Id. at 436. (If so, amendment \nwould be futile.) Finding that it had been, the court \ndenied leave to amend. It then summarily denied the \nmotion to withdraw\u2014which Texas calls the main is-\nsue\u2014in a single sentence. \nNor was the amendment issue simply lurking in \nthe record when Harisiades reached this Court. \nAmong the questions this Court granted was whether \nthe APA \u201cwas applicable to the proceeding against\u201d \n\n8 \n \nHarisiades\u2014a question that entered the case only \nthrough the motion to amend. Pet. for Writ of Cert. at \n5, Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, No. 50-43 (U.S. May 3, \n1951). Harisiades\u2019s opening brief then made clear \nthat he had \u201cmoved to amend\u201d his habeas application \nto allege facts supporting an APA claim after \u201cfil[ing] \na notice of appeal.\u201d Pet\u2019r. Br. at *10\u201311, Harisiades v. \nShaughnessy, 1951 WL 81967 (U.S. Dec. 4, 1951). \nAnd he argued the effective-date issue at length. Id. \nat *23\u201327. \nIf mid-appeal efforts to amend were abusive, this \nCourt had every reason and opportunity to say so. In-\nstead, it reached the \u201ceffective date\u201d question\u2014the \nbasis for denying leave to amend\u2014and affirmed on \nthe merits. Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, 342 U.S. 580, \n583 n.4 (1952). (Texas\u2019s references to \u201cstanding\u201d and \n\u201cconsent\u201d are misleading. Those statements related to \nanother argument, \u201caside\u201d from the APA. Id.) \nb. Texas fares no better with the remaining cases. \nIt first claims (at 36) that Strand v. United States, \n780 F.2d 1497 (10th Cir. 1985), involved mid-appeal \nefforts to supplement the record, not a motion to \namend. Even if that were right, Texas doesn\u2019t explain \nwhy (under its theory) that would not have been abu-\nsive. But Texas is wrong. The prisoner in Strand filed \ntwo mid-appeal motions asking the district court to \nconsider additional factual bases for habeas relief, \nand the Tenth Circuit called those motions \u201c\u00a72255 \npleadings.\u201d 780 F.2d at 1500 (emphasis added). Yet \nneither the United States nor any of the four judges \nwho heard the case hinted that they were abusive. \nTexas has even less to say about our other cases. It \nchiefly observes (at 36) that prisoners who introduced \nnew grounds for relief directly in the court of appeals \ndid not file \u201cRule 15 motions.\u201d Perhaps not. But the \n\n9 \n \nrelief those prisoners sought (and sometimes re-\nceived) was the chance to raise new habeas claims \nmid-appeal: precisely what Texas says was off-limits. \nNor does it matter that reaching the merits might \nsometimes have been \u201ceasier\u201d than applying early \nabuse-of-the-writ doctrine. Contra CJLF Br. 13\u201314. \nThat objection applies equally to the cases this Court \nrelied on in Banister. E.g., Gajewski v. Stevens, 346 \nF.2d 1000 (8th Cir. 1965). Here, as in Banister, what \nmatters is that court after court addressed mid-\nappeal efforts to amend \u201cwithout any comment about \nrepetitive litigation,\u201d 590 U.S. at 515\u2014not even as an \nalternative ground, mentioned in passing. \n2. Texas\u2019s amici cite just one pre-AEDPA case going \nthe other way. In Smith v. Armontrout, the Eighth \nCircuit called the prisoner\u2019s \u201cmotion to remand\u201d the \n\u201cfunctional equivalent of a second or successive peti-\ntion.\u201d 888 F.2d 530, 540 (1989). That court used the \nsame rationale to find Rule 59(e) motions successive \nin a case Banister deemed an outlier. See 590 U.S. at \n515 (citing Bannister v. Armontrout, 4 F.3d 1434, \n1445 (8th Cir. 1993)). Smith is an outlier too. \nFinally, there was no historical habeas practice of \nconstruing mid-appeal Rule 15 motions as Rule 60(b) \nmotions. Contra U.S. Br. 26. The United States mis-\nreads the procedural history of Bonin v. Vasquez, 999 \nF.2d 425 (9th Cir. 1993), which did not involve a mid-\nappeal filing of any sort. (It also double-counts Bonin \nv. Calderon, 59 F.3d 815 (9th Cir. 1995), a later opin-\nion in the same case.) The only takeaway from Bonin \nis that a motion seeking \u201cRelief From Judgment,\u201d \nfiled \u201cpursuant to Rule 60(b),\u201d was \u201cproperly con-\nstrued\u201d as a Rule 60(b) motion. 999 F.2d at 427\u201328. \n\n10 \n \nB. Mid-appeal Rule 15 motions offer a  \nviable path to relief. \n1. This Court may reverse without reaching the \nprocedural issues. The district court ruled on thresh-\nold jurisdictional grounds, holding that Rivers\u2019s pro-\nposed amendment was a second or successive applica-\ntion. The narrowest way to resolve this case would be \nto correct that error, reserving all other questions. \nAnticipating Texas\u2019s objections, we have explained \nwhy motions like Rivers\u2019s are viable. But questions \nabout the meaning of \u00a72244(b) are analytically dis-\ntinct from questions about the procedural path to re-\nlief, and the Court can answer the former without \ntackling the latter. E.g., Morgan v. Sundance, Inc., \n596 U.S. 411, 417 (2022) (\u201cassum[ing] without decid-\ning\u201d several antecedent issues and \u201cconsider[ing] only \nthe next step\u201d). That would be appropriate here, since \ntwo circuits allow mid-appeal Rule 15 motions, and \nthere are strong arguments for their viability. See \nUnited States v. Santarelli, 929 F.3d 95, 105\u201306 (3d \nCir. 2019); Ching v. United States, 298 F.3d 174, 177 \n(2d Cir. 2002). \n2. If the Court reaches the procedural issues, it \nshould apply \u00a72106 and the Federal Rules as written. \na. The procedural debate comes down to vacatur. \nNo one denies that clerks may docket mid-appeal \nRule 15 motions. All agree that such motions cannot \nbe granted absent vacatur. And all agree that Rule \n60(b) is one path to vacatur. Texas, however, needs \nthe Court to go further and deem Rule 60(b) the only \npath. But that ignores \u00a72106, the same s\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

He doesn\u2019t deny that this case is the ideal vehicle \nfor resolving it. And he admits that the conflict has \ndeepened even while this case has been pending. Ten \ncircuits have now splintered four ways over when 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2)\u2019s gatekeeping requirements for \n\u201csecond or successive\u201d habeas petitions kick in, and \nthe question is ripe for review.  \nLumpkin\u2019s only response is that the circuits are not \n\u201cintractably\u201d split because the Second, Third, and \nTenth might still \u201cself-correct\u201d in light of Banister v. \nDavis, 590 U.S. 504 (2020). Opp. 16. But those courts \nhave already had\u2014and rejected\u2014multiple opportuni-\nties to do so. Only this Court can resolve the conflict, \nand there is no reason to stay on the sidelines. \nWith nowhere else to turn, Lumpkin spends most of \nhis brief on the merits\u2014but none of his arguments \nmakes this case any less certworthy. Gonzalez v. \nCrosby, 545 U.S. 524 (2005), doesn\u2019t \u201cmandat[e]\u201d the \noutcome because that case did not implicate the tim-\ning question posed here. Contra Opp. 7. Nor can the \ndecision below be squared with Banister. Like the \nFifth Circuit, Lumpkin sidesteps historical habeas \npractice, and he offers no serious answer on AEDPA\u2019s \npurposes. Finally, Lumpkin is also wrong that Rule \n60(b) was Rivers\u2019s only path to relief. Even while an \nappeal is pending, a district court retains jurisdiction \nto issue an indicative ruling about new exculpatory \nevidence. Section 2244(b)(2) doesn\u2019t supplant Rule \n62.1 any more than it does Rule 59(e). \nThis case is the perfect opportunity to resolve an \nimportant question. The Court should grant review. \n\n2 \n \n \nI. Respondent concedes that the 7-1-1-1  \ncircuit split is certworthy. \nA.  Lumpkin admits \u201cthere is a mature circuit split\u201d \non the question presented, which \u201ccould be a suffi-\ncient basis to justify certiorari.\u201d Opp. 16. He\u2019s right. \nIn the Second Circuit, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) does not apply un-\ntil a prisoner exhausts appellate review of his first \nhabeas petition. In seven other circuits, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) \nkicks in once the district court enters final judgment \nor shortly thereafter. (Even those courts can\u2019t agree \non when.) In the Tenth Circuit, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies \neven sooner\u2014unless the prisoner satisfies a seven-\nfactor test. And in the Third Circuit, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) tog-\ngles on and off depending on who wins the appeal. \nSee Pet. 13\u201320. In short: the circuits are in shambles, \nand this Court\u2019s intervention is badly needed. \nThe split is now even deeper than it was when this \ncase started. As Lumpkin concedes (at 14), \u201c[t]he \nFourth and Eleventh Circuits [have] recently issued \nclear decisions\u201d deepening the conflict. Opp. 14. In \nBixby v. Stirling, 90 F.4th 140, 143, 145 (4th Cir. \n2024), the petitioner sought further habeas relief \nwhile the \u201cappeal from the denial of his [first] petition \nwas pending.\u201d The Fourth Circuit rejected that filing \nas a \u201csecond or successive\u201d petition, deepening the \nconflict. And the Eleventh Circuit, which had previ-\nously addressed the issue only in unpublished orders, \njust solidified the split in a published opinion. Citing \nthe decision below, it \u201cjoin[ed] the majority of \u2026 cir-\ncuits\u201d and expressly \u201cdisagree[d]\u201d with the Second \nCircuit\u2019s approach. Boyd v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corr., 114 \nF.4th 1232, 1238 & n.3 (11th Cir. 2024). \nB.  Split conceded, Lumpkin offers just one reason \nto punt: that \u201cthe minority circuits\u201d might still \u201cself-\ncorrect\u201d in light of Banister. Opp. 16. In his view, \n\n3 \n \n \n\u201c[t]his Court should grant certiorari only if they fail \nto do so at the next opportunity.\u201d Id. What Lumpkin \ndoesn\u2019t mention, however, is that those courts have \nalready had the chance to \u201cself-correct\u201d\u2014and they\u2019ve \npassed. Just a few weeks ago, the Third Circuit dou-\nbled down on its approach in an opinion citing Banis-\nter. See Ross v. Adm\u2019r E. Jersey State Prison, No. 23-\n1240, 2024 WL 4341335, at *6 (3d Cir. Sept. 30, \n2024). And the Second Circuit has also stuck to its \nguns. See Waiters v. United States, No. 20-2712, 2021 \nWL 11096770, at *1 (2d Cir. May 19, 2021) (continu-\ning to apply Whab v. United States, 408 F.3d 116 (2d \nCir. 2005)). \n* \n* \n* \nTen circuits have now split four ways over the \nquestion presented. The conflict is entrenched and \nwon\u2019t fix itself. And with roughly 99% of prisoners \nnow covered by the split, there is no reason for this \nCourt to wait any longer. See Fed. Bureau of Prisons, \nStatistics, bit.ly/Federal-Prisons; Prison Pol\u2019y Initia-\ntive, Appendix: State and Federal Prison Populations \n2019-2023, bit.ly/State-Prisons. It\u2019s high time to re-\nsolve this question once and for all. \nII. Respondent doesn\u2019t deny that this case is \nthe ideal vehicle to resolve a critically im-\nportant habeas question. \nA.  Lumpkin admits that the question presented is \nimportant. See Opp. 16 (conceding the \u201cimportance of \nclear jurisdictional rules\u201d). Rivers\u2019s amici agree. The \nNation\u2019s leading habeas scholars have explained how \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s rule \u201cleads to perverse results\u201d and \ncould \u201cbar potentially meritorious habeas claims.\u201d \nScholars Br. 13. The National Association of Criminal \nDefense Lawyers, the Innocence Project, and the \n\n4 \n \n \nFederal Public Defenders have warned that \u201can en-\ntire subset of Brady and ineffective assistance claims\u201d \nmay fall through the cracks. NACDL Br. 14. And \nnearly a dozen of this Court\u2019s former Article III col-\nleagues have urged it to grant review because \u201cthe \nmajority rule unduly burdens courts.\u201d Judges Br. 6.  \nB.  Lumpkin also doesn\u2019t deny that \u201cthis case is an \nideal vehicle.\u201d Pet. 3. The question presented is out-\ncome-determinative. No factual disputes will hinder \nreview. See Opp. 3\u20134. And\u2014unlike most habeas peti-\ntioners\u2014Rivers meticulously preserved all of his ar-\nguments below. No wonder Lumpkin doesn\u2019t dispute \nthat \u201cRivers will have a meaningful path to relief\u201d if \nthis Court reverses. Pet. 31. It\u2019s hard to imagine a \nbetter vehicle for addressing the question presented. \nIII. The decision below is wrong. \nA.  Section 2244(b)(2) does not strip district courts \nof jurisdiction to consider all habeas filings submitted \nwhile an initial petition is on appeal. In holding oth-\nerwise, the Fifth Circuit failed to cite Banister\u2014much \nless follow the roadmap that it lays out. Had it done \nso, the court would have realized that its ruling \ndoesn\u2019t square with either \u201chistorical precedents\u201d or \n\u201cstatutory aims.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 513. As to his-\ntory, early cases suggest that filings submitted while \nan initial habeas application is on appeal are not \n\u201csecond or successive.\u201d See Pet. 25\u201327; Scholars Br. \n6\u201313. And as to purposes, treating filings like Rivers\u2019s \nas \u201csecond or successive\u201d would frustrate\u2014not fur-\nther\u2014judicial economy, efficiency, and finality. See \nPet. 27\u201330; Judges Br. 7\u20138. The Fifth Circuit consid-\nered none of this, and its categorical rule can\u2019t be \nsquared with this Court\u2019s cases. \nB.  Lumpkin\u2019s responses don\u2019t wash. \n\n5 \n \n \n1.  Lumpkin chiefly argues (at 7\u20138) that cert isn\u2019t \nwarranted because Gonzalez \u201cmandated\u201d the outcome \nbelow and offers \u201csufficient guidance as to what con-\nstitutes a successive petition.\u201d That\u2019s doubly wrong. \nFor one thing, even if Lumpkin were right and \nGonzalez controlled, the lower courts are still in dis-\narray over how to apply its \u201cguidance.\u201d Contra Opp. \n7. The Fifth Circuit gleaned from Gonzalez the \u201cun-\nderlying principle\u201d that habeas filings \u201cintroduced af-\nter a final judgment \u2026 are deemed successive.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 10a. Other courts beg to differ. See, e.g., Doug-\nlas v. Workman, 560 F.3d 1156, 1190, 1193 (10th Cir. \n2009) (citing Gonzalez and adopting seven-factor \ntest); Moreland v. Robinson, 813 F.3d 315, 322\u201324 \n(6th Cir. 2016) (citing Gonzalez and pegging \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2) to the window for appeal); United States \nv. Santarelli, 929 F.3d 95, 105 (3d Cir. 2019) (pegging \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2) to exhaustion and stating that Gonzalez \n\u201cdoes not compel a different result\u201d). That alone war-\nrants review. \nBut Lumpkin isn\u2019t right: \u201cGonzalez does not answer \nthe question whether a [mid-appeal habeas filing] is a \n\u2018second or successive\u2019 habeas application under \n\u00a7 2244(b).\u201d Balbuena v. Sullivan, 970 F.3d 1176, 1200 \n(9th Cir. 2020) (Fletcher, J., concurring in the result). \nHow could it? The petitioner in Gonzalez sought relief \nmore than a year after his appeal ended, and his fil-\ning did not present a habeas claim in the first place. \nSee Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 527, 533 & n.6; Scholars \nBr. 23. So the \u201cgeneral expressions\u201d Lumpkin cites \ncan hardly \u201ccontrol the judgment in a subsequent suit \nwhen the very point is presented for decision.\u201d Co-\nhens v. Virginia, 19 U.S. (6 Wheat.) 264, 399 (1821).  \n2.  Turning to Banister, Lumpkin insists that the \ndecision below is \u201cconsistent with\u201d this Court\u2019s guid-\n\n6 \n \n \nance. Opp. 5. But he has no sound answer to the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s failure to cite Banister, and his efforts to de-\nfend that court\u2019s reasoning fall flat. \na.  Lumpkin concedes (at 10) that the Fifth Circuit \n\u201cdid not consider\u201d whether Rivers\u2019s filing \u201cwould have \n\u2018constituted an abuse of the writ, as that concept is \nexplained in [this Court\u2019s] pre-AEDPA cases.\u2019\u201d Banis-\nter, 590 U.S. at 512. Neither does Lumpkin.  \nInstead, he principally contends that the Fifth Cir-\ncuit was right to ignore that question because \u201cthe \ntext of \u00a7 2244, not abuse of the writ, [i]s the relevant \ninquiry.\u201d Opp. 10. That misses the point. No one \ndoubts that \u201cthe text of AEDPA \u2026 controls,\u201d nor does \nanyone think historical practice \u201cshould supplant \n\u00a7 2244(b) as gatekeeper.\u201d Contra Opp. 9. This Court \nlooked to \u201chistorical habeas doctrine and practice\u201d in \nBanister because \u201c[t]he phrase \u2018second or successive \nhabeas corpus application\u2019 \u2026 is a \u2018term of art\u2019 that \u2018is \nnot self-defining.\u2019\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 511 (quoting \nSlack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 486 (2000)). In other \nwords, historical practice matters precisely because \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2) \u201ctakes its full meaning from [the Court\u2019s] \ncase law.\u201d Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U.S. 930, 943 \n(2007). Ignoring that is a telltale sign that the Fifth \nCircuit (and Lumpkin) have taken a wrong turn.  \nAfter thumbing his nose at historical practice, \nLumpkin pivots to a source that Banister did not con-\nsult: legislative history. Citing a handful of floor \nstatements, Lumpkin declares that \u201cCongress likely \nintended\u201d to \u201ccurtail the problem of successive habeas \npetitions\u201d by \u201coverrid[ing] \u2026 pre-AEDPA legal stand-\nards.\u201d Opp. 9. \u201cWell, yes, but so what?\u201d Pulsifer v. \nUnited States, 601 U.S. 124, 135 n.3 (2024). Banister \nalready confirmed that AEDPA \u201cdid not redefine\u201d the \n\n7 \n \n \nstandard that matters here: \u201cwhat qualifies as a suc-\ncessive petition.\u201d 590 U.S. at 515.  \nIn all events, the legislative history doesn\u2019t favor \nLumpkin. As then-Chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee Orrin Hatch explained, AEDPA was in-\ntended to \u201cguarantee prisoners one complete and fair \ncourse of collateral review in the Federal System.\u201d \nFederal Habeas Corpus Reform: Eliminating Prison-\ners\u2019 Abuse of the Judicial Process: Hearing on S. 623 \nBefore the S. Comm. on the Judiciary, 104th Cong. 2, \n3 (1995) (emphasis added). That meant \u201cone full \ncourse of litigation up to the Supreme Court.\u201d Judi-\ncial Conference of the United States, Ad Hoc Comm. \non Fed. Habeas Corpus in Capital Cases, Comm. Re-\nport and Proposal (Lewis F. Powell, Jr., Chairman, \nAug. 23, 1989), reprinted in Habeas Corpus Reform: \nHearings Before the S. Comm. on the Judiciary, 101st \nCong. 7\u201330 (1991). It follows that \u201ca subsequent fil-\ning\u201d is not \u201c\u2018second or successive\u2019 \u2026 simply because \nthe district court rendered a [final] judgment.\u201d Ching \nv. United States, 298 F.3d 174, 178 (2d Cir. 2002)  \n(Sotomayor, J.).   \nb.  Lumpkin fares no better when he turns to Ban-\nister\u2019s other source of guidance, AEDPA\u2019s purposes. \nLumpkin begins (at 10) by chiding Rivers for \n\u201ctak[ing] issue with Congress\u2019 policy determinations\u201d \nand for quibbling with \u201cthe procedural impediments \nof \u00a7 2244(b) \u2026 in [and] of themselves.\u201d Not at all. \nEveryone agrees that petitions filed after the prisoner \nexhausts appellate review of his initial application \ncount as second or successive and are channeled \nthrough the court of appeals. See Pet. 27. The ques-\ntion here is whether \u00a7 2244(b)(2) also governs a filing \nlike Rivers\u2019s\u2014i.e., one submitted while the initial ap-\nplication is pending on appeal. As the petition ex-\n\n8 \n \n \nplained (at 27\u201330), \u201cAEDPA\u2019s own purposes\u201d suggest \nthat the answer is no. Banister, 590 U.S. at 512. By \ninvoking \u201cCongress\u2019 policy determinations,\u201d however, \nLumpkin merely begs the question. Opp. 10. \nTurning to the merits, Lumpkin warns that Riv-\ners\u2019s approach would waste \u201cjudicial resources\u201d and \npermit \u201can infinite number of post-judgment amend-\nments.\u201d Opp. 11, 13. But the Second Circuit has ap-\nplied the rule that Rivers advocates for nearly two \ndecades. So if Lumpkin is right, it\u2019s fair to ask why he \ndoesn\u2019t cite a single example of the abuses he fears. \nHis failure to do so suggests that district courts have \nall the tools they need to serve as effective gatekeep-\ners. See Whab, 408 F.3d at 119 n.2 (\u201cTraditional doc-\ntrines, such as abuse of the writ, continue to apply.\u201d); \nChing, 298 F.3d at 180 (\u201c[T]he decision to grant a mo-\ntion to amend is committed to the sound discretion of \nthe district court.\u201d); NACDL Br. 19\u201321. Nearly a doz-\nen \u201cformer judges who have dealt with numerous fil-\nings by habeas petitioners in both district and appel-\nlate roles\u201d agree. Judges Br. 7. In their experience, \n\u201cdistrict courts are best positioned to deal with and \ndispose of these types of post-appeal filings, and can \nreadily handle them using tools already at their dis-\nposal without resort to\u201d \u00a7 2244(b)(2). Id. at 4. \n3.  Finally, Lumpkin is also wrong that Rivers\u2019s on-\nly path to relief \u201cwould have been a Rule 60(b) mo-\ntion.\u201d Opp. 12. True, the district court \u201chad no juris-\ndiction to consider an \u2018amended\u2019 petition\u201d while the \ncase was \u201cpending on appeal.\u201d Opp. 12. But even \nwhile \u201can appeal \u2026 is pending,\u201d a district court may \nissue an indicative ruling stating \u201cthat [a] motion \nraises a substantial issue.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 62.1. The \nappellate court may then \u201cremand for further pro-\nceedings.\u201d Fed. R. App. P. 12.1(b). Here, had the dis-\n\n9 \n \n \ntrict court not misread \u00a7 2244(b)(2), it could have con-\nsidered Rivers\u2019s new evidence and (if warranted) \nstated that \u201cit would grant the motion if the court of \nappeals remand[ed].\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 62.1. In that \ncase, an \u201corder for remand would \u2026 amount in itself \nto a vacation of the judgment for further proceedings, \nincluding amendments.\u201d Markert v. Swift & Co., 173 \nF.2d 517, 520 (2d Cir. 1949) (deeming \u201cresort \u2026 to \nRule 60\u201d unnecessary); see also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106 (au-\nthorizing appellate courts to \u201cvacate \u2026 any judg-\nment\u201d and \u201crequire such further proceedings \u2026 as \nmay be just under the circumstances\u201d). \nContra Lumpkin, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) doesn\u2019t \u201csupplan[t]\u201d \nRule 62.1 any more than it does Rule 59(e). Opp. 11. \nLike a Rule 59(e) motion, a Rule 62.1 motion \u201cgives a \nprisoner only a narrow window to ask for relief.\u201d Ban-\nister, 590 U.S. at 516. Should both courts oblige, a \nremand for amendment would be \u201ca limited continua-\ntion of the original proceeding.\u201d Id. at 521. And if the \ndistrict court again denied relief, the prisoner would \n\u201ctak[e] a single appeal.\u201d Id. In short, Rule 59(e) and \nRule 62.1 are alike \u201cin just about every way that mat-\nters.\u201d Id. at 518. The courts below reached none of \nthis because they thought \u00a7 2244(b)(2) strips district \ncourts of jurisdiction to consider any \u201cpost-judgment\u201d \nhabeas filing. Opp. 5. Should this Court reverse, Riv-\ners will be free to seek 62.1 relief on remand. \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should grant the petition. \n \n\n10 \n \n \nRespectfully submitted,  \n \n \nPeter A.

June 2024).............  11, 14, 18 \n \n\n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nWhen a prisoner discovers exculpatory evidence \nmid-appeal, 28 U.S.C. \u00a72244(b) does not tie the dis-\ntrict court\u2019s hands. Habeas courts historically enter-\ntained mid-appeal efforts to amend, without a word \nabout successive litigation. Just before Congress en-\nacted \u00a72244(b), Texas itself told this Court why. \nWhen \u201cthere has been no appellate review of the \njudgment of the district court, there is no finality to \nthat court\u2019s review on the merits, and thus [an] \namended petition would not be subject to dismissal \nfor abuse.\u201d Pet\u2019r. Br., McCotter v. Petty, No. 85-1656, \n1986 WL 728550, at *23. \u201cCongress passed AEDPA \nagainst this legal backdrop, and did nothing to \nchange it.\u201d Banister v. Davis, 590 U.S. 504, 515 \n(2020). That should resolve this case. Rivers\u2019s motion \nwas not a second or successive application, and the \nFifth Circuit was wrong to hold otherwise. \nTexas scarcely disputes the meaning of \u00a72244(b). \nInstead, it spends most of its brief arguing that the \nrules of civil procedure do not permit mid-appeal ef-\nforts to amend. Every step of its logic is wrong\u2014but \nRivers can prevail whether or not this Court settles \nthe procedural debate. The courts below made a \nthreshold error about the meaning of \u00a72244(b), and \nthe Court can reverse on that basis alone.  \nWhen Texas does get around to \u00a72244(b), the theory \nit offers is wrong and unworkable. The State under-\nstandably abandons the decision below, which didn\u2019t \neven cite Banister. It then cobbles together a new \ntheory, consisting of one line from Banister and one \nline from Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524 (2005), Br. \n20, plus an ad hoc time-of-appeal rule borrowed from \nthe Sixth Circuit, Br. 28. That approach has no basis \nin text or history, and no other court has found it per-\nsuasive. It also guarantees that this issue will be \n\n2 \n \nback again soon, once the lower courts trip on the \ncracks already evident in Texas\u2019s theory. To save it-\nself time, the Court should reject that theory now. \nFinally, a word to clear the air. \u201cToo much public \ndiscourse today is sullied by ad hominem rhetoric,\u201d \nand Texas \u201cregrettably succumbs to this trend.\u201d Ra-\nmos v. Louisiana, 590 U.S. 83, 141 (2020) (Alito, J., \ndissenting). Presenting \u201cas historical fact the testi-\nmony of the prosecution\u2019s witnesses,\u201d Glossip v. Ok-\nlahoma, 145 S. Ct. 612, 620 n.1 (2025), its brief \nbrands Rivers as an \u201cadmitted\u201d child abuser who has \nspent \u201cthe last thirteen years\u201d seeking to \u201cescape jus-\ntice.\u201d Br. 1. Even if true, that would shed no light on \nthe meaning of \u00a72244(b). But Rivers denies such ad-\nmissions, ROA.1584, and he has presented new evi-\ndence calling his convictions into question. If the \nCourt reverses, those merits issues will be ripe for \nreview. But this case is about \u00a72244(b)\u2014\u201c[s]o all the \ntalk\u201d of escaping justice \u201cis entirely out of place.\u201d \nRamos, 590 U.S. at 143. \nARGUMENT \nI. There is no obstacle to reaching the  \nquestion presented. \nA. This Court has jurisdiction. \nRivers has appellate standing. The district court re-\nfused to consider Rivers\u2019s proposed amendment, mis-\ntakenly holding that \u00a72244(b) stripped it of jurisdic-\ntion. Pet. App. 19a. The Fifth Circuit affirmed. Pet. \nApp. 11a. That judgment injures Rivers because it \nmakes his path to habeas relief \u201crockier.\u201d Banister, \n590 U.S. at 509. \u201cAnd a favorable ruling from this \nCourt would redress [his] injury by reversing that \njudgment.\u201d Food Mktg. Inst. v. Argus Leader Media, \n588 U.S. 427, 432\u201333 (2019).  \n\n3 \n \nNor is the case moot. Texas never explains (at 17) \nwhat \u201cjurisdictional consequences\u201d flow from the \nclerk\u2019s decision to docket Rivers\u2019s proposed amend-\nment as a new case, but that error is easily fixed. On \nremand, Rivers could move to consolidate this case \nwith his original habeas case, where his amendment \nbelonged from the start. Cf. Sherrod v. Am. Airlines, \nInc., 132 F.3d 1112, 1117 (5th Cir. 1998) (after consol-\nidation, \u201call motions filed in the second lawsuit were \ndeemed filed in the consolidated suit\u201d). He could then \nmove under Rule 60(b)(6) for relief from the judgment \ndenying his original habeas application. The grounds \nfor that motion would be integrity-based: that the \ndistrict court\u2019s threshold jurisdictional error, Pet. \nApp. 18a\u201319a, \u201cprecluded\u201d it from considering Riv-\ners\u2019s proposed amendment while the original case \nwas still pending. Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 532 n.4. If \nthe district court granted that motion, Rivers\u2019s origi-\nnal petition would again be pending, and the court \ncould grant leave to amend. See Chafin v. Chafin, 568 \nU.S. 165, 174 (2013) (\u201c[P]rospects of success are \u2026 \nnot pertinent to the mootness inquiry.\u201d). \nThe Court also has habeas jurisdiction. While Riv-\ners has served his child-pornography sentences, he \nremains \u201cin custody\u201d for sexual assault and indecen-\ncy. 28 U.S.C. \u00a72254(a). The proposed amendment \npleads facts that could warrant relief from those con-\nvictions. J.A.68\u201369, 75. Prosecutors used the alleged \nchild pornography to show \u201cmotive,\u201d ROA.733, and \n\u201cconfir[m] what the girls were saying,\u201d ROA.1045, \nand Rivers can argue on remand that the new evi-\ndence would have undermined the State\u2019s case. The \nalleged confession, which jurors never heard, would \nbe immaterial under Strickland and Napue. \n\n4 \n \nB. Rivers\u2019s arguments are properly before \nthe Court. \n1. Rivers\u2019s arguments are fairly included within the \nquestion presented. The paragraph introducing that \nquestion stated that Rivers \u201csought to amend his ini-\ntial habeas application while it was pending on ap-\npeal\u201d and explained that the circuits are split on \n\u201cwhether \u00a72244(b)(2) applies to such filings.\u201d Pet. i. \nThe question then asked whether \u00a72244(b)(2) applies \nto all, some, or no filings submitted between final \njudgment and the end of appellate review. \nOur opening brief offered the Court two ways to an-\nswer that question. Texas concedes that the broader, \ntiming-focused theory\u2014that \u00a72244(b)(2) does not ap-\nply to any mid-appeal habeas filings\u2014is properly be-\nfore the Court and fits squarely within the question \npresented. If that\u2019s true, then so must our amend-\nment theory: that \u00a72244(b)(2) does not apply to some \nmid-appeal filings. The greater (mid-appeal filings) \nincludes the lesser (mid-appeal Rule 15 motions). And \ndeciding the case on that ground would all but resolve \nthe circuit conflict, since most cases in the split in-\nvolved amendments. \n2. Rivers also preserved his amendment theory. \nRivers told the district court that \u00a72244(b)(2) did not \napply because he had filed \u201can amendment to [his] \ninitial petition under Fed. R. Civ. P. 15.\u201d Pet\u2019r. Objec-\ntions, No. 7:21-cv-00012 (N.D. Tex. Sept. 2, 2021), \nDkt. 27, at 8; see also id. at 7\u20138 (applying Rule 15 \nwould not \u201cfrustrate AEDPA\u2019s goals\u201d). He pressed the \nsame argument on appeal, reasoning that \u201ca supple-\nment/amendment should be acceptable under Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 15 and thus the new claims should not be sub-\nject to \u00a72244.\u201d C.A. Br. 8. That\u2019s more than enough to \npreserve the argument that \u00a72244(b) does not apply \n\n5 \n \nto amendments, especially under the relaxed stand-\nards for pro se litigants.  \nThe amendment argument is properly before this \nCourt too. The petition stated that Rivers \u201curg[ed] the \ncourt to construe [his] filing as an amendment ... in-\nstead of a second or successive petition.\u201d Pet. 12. Fol-\nlowing Banister\u2019s logic, it then argued that the lower \ncourts were wrong to apply \u00a72244(b). Compare Pet. \n25\u201326 with Br. 25\u201327 (history), and Pet. 27\u201330 with \nBr. 31\u201335 (purposes). Texas is right that Rivers first \ncited \u00a72242 at the merits stage. But our \u00a72242 argu-\nment is just that: an argument in support of the same \nclaim that Rivers has made all along\u2014that \u00a72244(b) \ndoes not apply. See Yee v. City of Escondido, 503 U.S. \n519, 534 (1992). Texas does not suggest otherwise. In \nall events, this Court \u201cretains the independent power \nto identify and apply the proper construction of gov-\nerning law.\u201d Kamen v. Kemper Fin. Servs., Inc., 500 \nU.S. 90, 99 (1991). \n3. The procedural issues were also on full display \nwhen the Court granted cert. Anticipating Texas\u2019s ob-\njections, our petition explained that Rule 62.1 allows \ndistrict courts to consider mid-appeal filings. See Pet. \n3, 29 (citing case law). Texas responded that \u201cthe only \nway Rivers could have reopened the judgment to \namend\u201d was \u201cRule 60(b).\u201d BIO 12. Our reply showed \nwhy that was wrong\u2014previewing the procedural \npathway set forth in our opening merits brief. See \nReply 9 (citing Rules 62.1 and 12.1, \u00a72106, and case \nlaw). The Court may address these \u201cantecedent\u201d mat-\nters, Arcadia v. Ohio Power Co., 498 U.S. 73, 77 \n(1990), as \u201csubsidiary issues fairly comprised by the \nquestion presented,\u201d City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian \nNation, 544 U.S. 197, 214 n.8 (2005).  \n\n6 \n \nII. A motion to amend or supplement an initial \nhabeas petition that is pending on appeal is \nnot a \u201csecond or successive\u201d application. \nA. A mid-appeal Rule 15 motion is not a \n\u201csecond or successive\u201d application.  \nText. Whatever the phrase \u201csecond or successive \nhabeas corpus application\u201d means, it cannot cover \nmotions to amend. Congress treated \u201csecond or suc-\ncessive application[s]\u201d and \u201camendment[s] to an ap-\nplication\u201d as distinct legal concepts. \u00a72266(b)(2)(B), \n(b)(3)(B). It subjected them to different legal rules. \nSee \u00a72242; \u00a72244(b). And when Congress wanted to \nsubject amendments to the rules governing second or \nsuccessive applications, it said so. See \u00a72266(b)(3)(B). \nAs the United States concedes, all other amendments \n\u201cfollow the Federal Rules,\u201d U.S. Br. 17, so applying \n\u00a72244(b) instead would flout Congress\u2019s drafting \nchoices. Plenty of challenges might await a mid-\nappeal Rule 15 motion, but \u00a72244(b) isn\u2019t one of them. \nTexas fails to answer most of these points. It chiefly \nargues (at 29) that \u00a72242 applies only before final \njudgment, whereas \u00a72244(b) applies after. But the \nstatutes don\u2019t say that, and the \u00a72242 Codifier\u2019s Note \nsuggests otherwise. Congress added the amendment \nprovision to \u201cconform to existing practice,\u201d Codifier\u2019s \nNote, 28 U.S.C. \u00a72242 (1952), and fresh on its mind \nwould have been Price v. Johnston, 334 U.S. 266 \n(1948). After the prisoner there made new factual al-\nlegations in his appellate brief, this Court remanded \nfor \u201camendment or elaboration of [the] pleadings.\u201d Id. \nat 277, 290\u201391. Pre-AEDPA courts continued to en-\ntertain such efforts, and Texas cites no language in \n\u00a72244(b) purporting to \u201caffec[t]\u201d this practice. Contra \nResp. Br. 29. Finally, because amendments and sec-\nond or successive applications are mutually exclusive \ncategories, \u201cthere is no conflict\u201d between \u00a72242(b) and \n\n7 \n \n\u00a72244. Nat\u2019l Cable & Telecomms. Ass\u2019n v. Gulf Power \nCo., 534 U.S. 327, 336 (2002). \nHistory. The history here is even stronger than in \nBanister. Our opening brief cited cases from six cir-\ncuits that addressed mid-appeal efforts to amend \u201con \nthe merits.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 515. Texas\u2019s amici \ncite only one case going the other way\u2014the same los-\ning score as in Banister.  \n1. Texas can\u2019t get around the historical cases that \nentertained mid-appeal motions to amend. \na. Nearly everything Texas says about Harisiades \nv. Shaughnessy is wrong. Had Harisiades just wanted \nto \u201cbuttress\u201d his claims with \u201cintervening authority,\u201d \nBr. 35, he could have done so in an appellate brief. \nInstead, he sought to \u201camend\u201d his \u201cpetition\u201d with new \nfactual allegations supporting a claim under the APA, \nwhich this Court had just held applicable to deporta-\ntion proceedings like his. 90 F. Supp. 431, 432 n.2 \n(S.D.N.Y. 1950). Only later, when the government ar-\ngued that \u201cthe notice of appeal barred the District \nCourt from considering the motion,\u201d did Harisiades \nmove to withdraw his appeal. Id. at 433. Faced with \nthe two motions, the court \u201cfirst consider[ed] the mer-\nits of the original application for leave to amend.\u201d Id. \nat 434. It then spent six pages analyzing \u201cwhether \nthe deportation proceeding was \u2018initiated\u2019 prior to the \n[APA\u2019s] effective date.\u201d Id. at 436. (If so, amendment \nwould be futile.) Finding that it had been, the court \ndenied leave to amend. It then summarily denied the \nmotion to withdraw\u2014which Texas calls the main is-\nsue\u2014in a single sentence. \nNor was the amendment issue simply lurking in \nthe record when Harisiades reached this Court. \nAmong the questions this Court granted was whether \nthe APA \u201cwas applicable to the proceeding against\u201d \n\n8 \n \nHarisiades\u2014a question that entered the case only \nthrough the motion to amend. Pet. for Writ of Cert. at \n5, Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, No. 50-43 (U.S. May 3, \n1951). Harisiades\u2019s opening brief then made clear \nthat he had \u201cmoved to amend\u201d his habeas application \nto allege facts supporting an APA claim after \u201cfil[ing] \na notice of appeal.\u201d Pet\u2019r. Br. at *10\u201311, Harisiades v. \nShaughnessy, 1951 WL 81967 (U.S. Dec. 4, 1951). \nAnd he argued the effective-date issue at length. Id. \nat *23\u201327. \nIf mid-appeal efforts to amend were abusive, this \nCourt had every reason and opportunity to say so. In-\nstead, it reached the \u201ceffective date\u201d question\u2014the \nbasis for denying leave to amend\u2014and affirmed on \nthe merits. Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, 342 U.S. 580, \n583 n.4 (1952). (Texas\u2019s references to \u201cstanding\u201d and \n\u201cconsent\u201d are misleading. Those statements related to \nanother argument, \u201caside\u201d from the APA. Id.) \nb. Texas fares no better with the remaining cases. \nIt first claims (at 36) that Strand v. United States, \n780 F.2d 1497 (10th Cir. 1985), involved mid-appeal \nefforts to supplement the record, not a motion to \namend. Even if that were right, Texas doesn\u2019t explain \nwhy (under its theory) that would not have been abu-\nsive. But Texas is wrong. The prisoner in Strand filed \ntwo mid-appeal motions asking the district court to \nconsider additional factual bases for habeas relief, \nand the Tenth Circuit called those motions \u201c\u00a72255 \npleadings.\u201d 780 F.2d at 1500 (emphasis added). Yet \nneither the United States nor any of the four judges \nwho heard the case hinted that they were abusive. \nTexas has even less to say about our other cases. It \nchiefly observes (at 36) that prisoners who introduced \nnew grounds for relief directly in the court of appeals \ndid not file \u201cRule 15 motions.\u201d Perhaps not. But the \n\n9 \n \nrelief those prisoners sought (and sometimes re-\nceived) was the chance to raise new habeas claims \nmid-appeal: precisely what Texas says was off-limits. \nNor does it matter that reaching the merits might \nsometimes have been \u201ceasier\u201d than applying early \nabuse-of-the-writ doctrine. Contra CJLF Br. 13\u201314. \nThat objection applies equally to the cases this Court \nrelied on in Banister. E.g., Gajewski v. Stevens, 346 \nF.2d 1000 (8th Cir. 1965). Here, as in Banister, what \nmatters is that court after court addressed mid-\nappeal efforts to amend \u201cwithout any comment about \nrepetitive litigation,\u201d 590 U.S. at 515\u2014not even as an \nalternative ground, mentioned in passing. \n2. Texas\u2019s amici cite just one pre-AEDPA case going \nthe other way. In Smith v. Armontrout, the Eighth \nCircuit called the prisoner\u2019s \u201cmotion to remand\u201d the \n\u201cfunctional equivalent of a second or successive peti-\ntion.\u201d 888 F.2d 530, 540 (1989). That court used the \nsame rationale to find Rule 59(e) motions successive \nin a case Banister deemed an outlier. See 590 U.S. at \n515 (citing Bannister v. Armontrout, 4 F.3d 1434, \n1445 (8th Cir. 1993)). Smith is an outlier too. \nFinally, there was no historical habeas practice of \nconstruing mid-appeal Rule 15 motions as Rule 60(b) \nmotions. Contra U.S. Br. 26. The United States mis-\nreads the procedural history of Bonin v. Vasquez, 999 \nF.2d 425 (9th Cir. 1993), which did not involve a mid-\nappeal filing of any sort. (It also double-counts Bonin \nv. Calderon, 59 F.3d 815 (9th Cir. 1995), a later opin-\nion in the same case.) The only takeaway from Bonin \nis that a motion seeking \u201cRelief From Judgment,\u201d \nfiled \u201cpursuant to Rule 60(b),\u201d was \u201cproperly con-\nstrued\u201d as a Rule 60(b) motion. 999 F.2d at 427\u201328. \n\n10 \n \nB. Mid-appeal Rule 15 motions offer a  \nviable path to relief. \n1. This Court may reverse without reaching the \nprocedural issues. The district court ruled on thresh-\nold jurisdictional grounds, holding that Rivers\u2019s pro-\nposed amendment was a second or successive applica-\ntion. The narrowest way to resolve this case would be \nto correct that error, reserving all other questions. \nAnticipating Texas\u2019s objections, we have explained \nwhy motions like Rivers\u2019s are viable. But questions \nabout the meaning of \u00a72244(b) are analytically dis-\ntinct from questions about the procedural path to re-\nlief, and the Court can answer the former without \ntackling the latter. E.g., Morgan v. Sundance, Inc., \n596 U.S. 411, 417 (2022) (\u201cassum[ing] without decid-\ning\u201d several antecedent issues and \u201cconsider[ing] only \nthe next step\u201d). That would be appropriate here, since \ntwo circuits allow mid-appeal Rule 15 motions, and \nthere are strong arguments for their viability. See \nUnited States v. Santarelli, 929 F.3d 95, 105\u201306 (3d \nCir. 2019); Ching v. United States, 298 F.3d 174, 177 \n(2d Cir. 2002). \n2. If the Court reaches the procedural issues, it \nshould apply \u00a72106 and the Federal Rules as written. \na. The procedural debate comes down to vacatur. \nNo one denies that clerks may docket mid-appeal \nRule 15 motions. All agree that such motions cannot \nbe granted absent vacatur. And all agree that Rule \n60(b) is one path to vacatur. Texas, however, needs \nthe Court to go further and deem Rule 60(b) the only \npath. But that ignores \u00a72106, the same statute that \npermits this Court to GVR. E.g., Lawrence v. Chater, \n516 U.S. 163, 166\u201367 (1996) (\u201cWe have GVR\u2019d\u201d under \n\u00a72106 \u201cin light of \u2026 changed factual circumstances\u201d). \n\n11 \n \ni. According to Texas, \u201cevery regional circuit holds\u201d \nthat postjudgment amendment requires \u201crelief under \nRule 59(e) or Rule 60(b).\u201d Br. 23. That is not what the \ncases say. Most of the thirty-odd cases cited by Texas \nand its amici involved efforts to amend after judg-\nment and before appeal, when a movant would need \nto seek vacatur under Rules 59(e) or 60(b). None \ncites\u2014let alone purports to limit\u2014\u00a72106. None holds \nthat a party who secures a reversal must still seek \nRule 60(b) relief before amending. And none suggests \nthat Rule 60(b) is necessary when the court of ap-\npeals vacates without reaching the merits.  \nThe treatises don\u2019t help Texas either. The Wright & \nMiller section \u201cexplaining why Rivers cannot do what \nhe proposes,\u201d Resp. Br. 34, actually states Rivers\u2019s \nrule. \u201c[T]he district court may request the court of \nappeals to remand the case for consideration of the \nmotion for leave to amend and the remand order will \nbe viewed as comparable to a vacation of the lower \ncourt\u2019s judgment.\u201d 6 Wright & Miller, Federal Prac-\ntice & Procedure \u00a71489 (3d ed. June 2024); see 13A \nCyc. of Fed. Proc. \u00a763:11 (3d ed. Jan. 2025) (similar). \nii. The United States insists (at 29) that \u00a72106 may \nnot be used to \u201cavoi[d] the limitations of the federal \nprocedural rules.\u201d But Rule 60(b) does not purport to \nlimit the exercise of appellate vacatur. Nor does it \npurport to be the only path to district-court vacatur. \nRule 60(d)(1) disclaims such exclusivity by preserving \nthe \u201cindependent action,\u201d one of the \u201cold forms of ob-\ntaining relief from a judgment.\u201d United States v. \nBeggerly, 524 U.S. 38, 45 (1998). And this Court has \ntreated \u00a72106 and Rule 60(b) as alternative paths to \nvacatur. See U.S. Bancorp Mortg. Co. v. Bonner Mall \nP\u2019ship, 513 U.S. 18, 29 (1994) (appellate court \u201cmay \nremand\u201d for consideration of Rule 60(b) vacatur \u201ceven \n\n12 \n \nin the absence of, or before considering the existence \nof\u201d grounds for \u00a72106 vacatur (emphasis added)). \nNo case holds otherwise. Contra U.S. Br. 29\u201330. \nUnitherm Food Systems, Inc. v. Swift-Eckrich, Inc., \n546 U.S. 394, 402 n.4 (2006), reasoned that \u00a72106 \ncannot be used to do what this Court had long inter-\npreted Rule 50 to \u201cforbi[d].\u201d But (again) this Court \nhas never held that Rule 60(b) forbids appellate vaca-\ntur. As for Calderon v. Thompson, 523 U.S. 538, 546 \n(1998), that case says nothing about \u00a72106, and the \nNinth Circuit recalled its mandate after this Court \ndenied cert, when all agree that \u00a72244(b) applies.  \nIf the United States is worried that appellate courts \nwill use \u00a72106 to circumvent Rule 60(b), this Court \ncan always clarify the \u00a72106 standards. But this de-\nbate is about vacatur authority\u2014not vacatur stand-\nards\u2014and Rivers has never argued that \u00a72106 is less \nexacting than Rule 60(b). Cf. Bancorp, 513 U.S. at 26 \n(\u00a72106 vacatur is \u201cextraordinary remedy\u201d). \nb. Texas (but not the United States) floats various \nother objections. None is sound. \ni. Rule 62.1 applies to Rule 15 motions, and Texas \ncites no case suggesting otherwise. The phrase \u201cmo-\ntion \u2026 for relief,\u201d Rule 62.1(a), covers \u201cany motion \nthat the district court cannot grant because of a pend-\ning appeal,\u201d Report of the Civil Rules Advisory Com-\nmittee, Dec. 12, 2006 at 14. A motion to amend \u201cfalls \nwithin th[at] scope.\u201d Scriber v. Ford Motor Co., 2024 \nWL 2830499, at *3 (S.D. Cal. June 4, 2024); see Rule \n7(b)(1)(C) (motions must \u201cstate the relief sought\u201d); \nCarbiener v. Lender Processing Servs., Inc., 2014 WL \n12616966, at *2 n.6 (M.D. Fla. Sept. 29, 2014) (\u201cleave \nto amend\u201d is \u201crelief\u201d). Plenty of courts have consid-\nered Rule 15 motions under Rule 62.1. E.g., Scriber, \n2024 WL 2830499, at *3; Louisiana v. Becerra, No. \n\n13 \n \n21-cv-03970, ECF No. 59, at 5 (W.D. La. Feb. 9, \n2022); Beverley v. N.Y.C. Health & Hosp. Corp., 2020 \nWL 5750828, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 25, 2020). \nNor does Texas cite (at 32) any case requiring a \nstandalone \u201cRule 62.1 motion.\u201d Rule 62.1 mentions \nonly one motion: the underlying \u201cmotion \u2026 for relief \nthat the court lacks jurisdiction to grant.\u201d Meanwhile, \nthe \u201csplit\u201d that Texas cites is about what to do when \nthere is no underlying motion\u2014not about whether a \nRule 62.1 motion is necessary. Anyhow, Rivers did \nseek an indicative ruling. He didn\u2019t use the magic \nwords \u201cindicative ruling under Rule 62.1(a)(3),\u201d but \nthat is the only plausible way to construe his request \nfor \u201cinterlocutory review.\u201d J.A.107; see also C.A. \nOpening Br. 8; Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 106 \n(1976) (pro se filings are \u201cliberally construed\u201d). \nTexas is also wrong (at 33) that Rule 62.1 imports \n\u201cRule 60(b)\u2019s deadlines.\u201d A \u201ctimely motion,\u201d Rule \n62.1(a), is a motion that is timely under whatever \nstandards govern that motion. That follows from the \ndrafters\u2019 choice to \u201cg[o] beyond Rule 60(b) motions\u201d \nand \u201cinclude all circumstances in which a pending \nappeal\u201d bars relief. Committee Report at 14. Nor \nwould reading Rule 62.1 faithfully render Rule 60(b)\u2019s \ndeadlines \u201cmeaningless.\u201d Resp. Br. 33. When no ap-\npeal is pending, an amendment must go through Rule \n60(b), and would thus be subject to its deadlines. And \nRule 60(b) is also necessary for relief unavailable un-\nder Rule 15. In all events, Texas\u2019s deadline argument \nassumes (at 33 n.5) that the Rule 60(b)(6) door is shut \nfor newly discovered evidence. But this Court has \nnever held that, and some courts disagree. E.g., \nPETA v. HHS, 901 F.3d 343, 355 (D.C. Cir. 2018). \nii. The State\u2019s Rule 15 objections are nonstarters \ntoo. The heading \u201cAmendments Before Trial\u201d was \u201cin-\ntended to be stylistic only.\u201d Committee Notes on 2007 \n\n14 \n \nAmendment; see also Wright & Miller \u00a71488 \n(\u201c[C]ourts have not imposed any arbitrary timing re-\nstrictions on requests for leave to amend \u2026.\u201d). And \nRule 15(b)(2)\u2019s provision for amendment \u201ceven after \njudgment\u201d simply means that vacatur is unnecessary \nwhen a party seeks to \u201cconform the pleadings to the \nproof.\u201d First Nat\u2019l Bank of Louisville v. Cont\u2019l Ill. \nNat\u2019l Bank & Tr. Co., 933 F.2d 466, 468 (7th Cir. \n1991) (Posner, J.). That doesn\u2019t imply that Rule 15(a) \nbecomes unavailable after the court enters judgment. \nIt just means Rule 15(b)(2) motions\u2014unlike Rule \n15(a) motions\u2014can be granted absent vacatur. \niii. Texas\u2019s response to \u00a72106 is a non sequitur. \nBr. 32. No one is talking about \u201cenlarg[ing] the record \non appeal.\u201d Stanton v. Liaw, 2023 WL 3645525, at *3 \n(7th Cir. May 25, 2023). The point is that appellate \ncourts are \u201cbound to consider any change, either in \nfact or in law, which has supervened since the judg-\nment was entered.\u201d Patterson v. Alabama, 294 U.S. \n600, 607 (1935). If \u201csuch a change \u2026 may affect the \nresult,\u201d courts \u201cmay recognize\u201d this \u201cby setting aside \nthe judgment and remanding.\u201d Id.; see, e.g., Giles v. \nMaryland, 386 U.S. 66, 74 (1967) (plurality) (postcon-\nviction vacatur in light of new evidence); United \nStates v. Shotwell Mfg. Co., 355 U.S. 233, 237 (1957). \nIII. Alternatively, \u00a72244(b) applies only after \nthe initial petition is final on appeal. \nThe Court could also reverse by holding that \n\u00a72244(b) does not apply while an appeal is pending. \n(By clarifying that mid-appeal Rule 60(b) motions are \nnot successive, the Court would also make the proce-\ndural debate a nonissue.) Texas\u2019s criticism (at 37) \nthat Rivers gave \u201ccursory treatment\u201d to this theory is \nbaffling. Historical and purposive arguments for mid-\nappeal amendments equally support the broader \npoint that \u00a72244(b) permits mid-appeal habeas \n\n15 \n \nclaims. Br. 25\u201335. In all events, history confirms that \nmid-appeal Rule 60(b) motions were not considered \nabusive, and only Rivers\u2019s rule responds to AEDPA\u2019s \npurposes. Contra Texas (at 13), Banister did not \n\u201cforeclos[e]\u201d these arguments, and \u201cwhat the Court \ndid say \u2026 hardly advances the [State\u2019s] cause here.\u201d \nPerez v. Sturgis Pub. Schs., 598 U.S. 142, 149 (2023). \nContext. Other provisions of AEDPA tie finality to \na final, nonappealable order\u2014not a judgment. This \nreflects the \u201clong-recognized, clear meaning\u201d of finali-\nty in the postconviction context. Clay v. United \nStates, 537 U.S. 522, 527 (2003). After all, \u201c[w]hen a \nsovereign furnishes an opportunity to appeal \u2026 none \nof the preceding decisions are final in an ultimate \nsense until any appeals are concluded.\u201d Edwards v. \nVannoy, 593 U.S. 255, 287 n.2 (2021) (Gorsuch, J., \nconcurring) (quoting 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries \non the Laws of England 411 (1768)) (cleaned up).  \nTexas retorts (at 38) that Clay is distinguishable \nbecause its rule \u201cpromote[s] federal-state comity.\u201d \nBut Clay involved a \u201cfederal prisoner\u201d and said noth-\ning about comity. 537 U.S. at 524. Nor did Clay limit \nits logic to \u201cthe context of initial federal applications.\u201d \nResp. Br. 38. Speaking broadly about the \u201cpostconvic-\ntion\u201d context, Clay said that finality attaches when \nthis Court affirms, denies review, or when the chance \nto seek cert expires. 537 U.S. at 527. \nHistory. In the decades before AEDPA, what was \ntrue of mid-appeal Rule 15 motions, Br. 27\u201331, was \nalso true of mid-appeal habeas claims generally. \nA. As of 1987, it was settled law that abuse-of-the-\nwrit doctrine did not cover mid-appeal habeas filings. \nTexas would know. As the United States recognizes \n(at 26), the Fifth Circuit remanded to \u201callo[w] \npostjudgment amendment without considering abuse \n\n16 \n \nof the writ\u201d in Petty v. McCotter, 779 F.2d 299, 302 \n(5th Cir. 1986). Texas challenged that ruling, and \nthis Court granted cert (later dismissed as improvi-\ndently granted). Lynaugh v. Petty, 480 U.S. 699 \n(1987) (Mem.). In its opening brief, Texas explained \nthat \u201c[b]ecause there ha[d] been no appellate review \nof the judgment of the district court, there [w]as no \nfinality to that court\u2019s review on the merits.\u201d Pet\u2019r. \nBr. at *23, 1986 WL 728550. In other words (Texas\u2019s \nown): \u201cthe abuse doctrine simply does not apply\u201d \nwhen a prisoner \u201cis sent back to the District Court\u201d \nbecause \u201c[i]t is all the same case. It is not a new \ncase.\u201d Oral Arg. Recording at 10:05, Lynaugh, No. 86-\n1656 (Mar. 3, 1987), bit.ly/Petty_OA. The author of \nGonzalez also weighed in. See id. at 8:29 (Justice \nScalia: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have seen any basis for arguing an \nabuse of the writ.\u201d). \nB. To show that AEDPA codified the opposite view, \nTexas would need to show that a sea change took \nplace over the next nine years. Nothing of the sort \nhappened. Between 1987 and 1996, at least six cases \naddressed mid-appeal Rule 60(b) motions without \ndeeming them successive. See United States v. Ed-\nmonson, 928 F. Supp. 1052, 1053\u201355 (D. Kan. 1996); \nMay v. Collins, 961 F.2d 74 (5th Cir. 1992); Carriger \nv. Lewis, 971 F.2d 329, 331\u201332 (9th Cir. 1992) (en \nbanc); Ford v. Armontrout, 916 F.2d 457, 459, 461 \n(8th Cir. 1990); Giarratano v. Procunier, 891 F.2d \n483, 486\u201387 (4th Cir. 1989); Schewchun v. Edwards, \n815 F.2d 79 (Table) (6th Cir. 1987). Three went the \nother way. See Guinan v. Delo, 5 F.3d 313 (8th Cir. \n1993); Hunt v. Nuth, 57 F.3d 1327 (4th Cir. 1995); \nBehringer v. Johnson, 75 F.3d 189 (5th Cir. 1996). \nAnd some cases sent mixed signals. See Resnover v. \nPearson, 1993 WL 430159 (7th Cir. 1993); McQueen \nv. Scroggy, 99 F.3d 1302 (6th Cir. 1996). The final tal-\n\n17 \n \nly: lopsided for Rivers. But even if the post-Petty cas-\nes were a draw, that is \u201chardly the sort of uniform \nconstruction that Congress might have endorsed.\u201d \nFogerty v. Fantasy, Inc., 510 U.S. 517, 532 (1994); see \nScalia & Garner, Reading Law 325 (2012). \nPurposes. Both of Rivers\u2019s theories respond to \nAEDPA\u2019s aims. Texas\u2019s theory does not, and its objec-\ntions miss the mark.  \nA. River\u2019s approach furthers all three of AEDPA\u2019s \naims. First, judicial economy. Our rule benefits re-\nviewing courts by flagging mid-appeal claims that \ncould make it \u201caltogether unnecessary\u201d to decide the \nappeal. Banister, 590 U.S. at 516. And all with mini-\nmal burden on district courts whose \u201cfamiliar[ity] \nwith a habeas applicant\u2019s claims\u201d will make for \u201cquick \nwork of a meritless motion.\u201d Id. at 517. Texas objects \n(at 41) that a prisoner whose mid-appeal motion is \ndenied under Rule 62.1(a)(2) could later refile it as a \nsuccessive application. That\u2019s conceivable\u2014although \nany prisoner who sized up the odds would likely take \nno for an answer. Even if he didn\u2019t, however, the \ncourt of appeals would still have \u201cthe benefit of the \ndistrict court\u2019s plenary findings,\u201d id., and could deny \nauthorization in a one-line order citing the prior de-\nnial. By contrast, Texas would channel every mid-\nappeal habeas filing to an appeals panel under \n\u00a72244(b)(3)(B)\u2014demanding \u201ca significant investment \nof time and resources.\u201d Judges\u2019 Br. 6. It would also \nforce the merits panel to decide the original appeal, \neven if every judge involved thought that the new ev-\nidence would change the outcome. That is why this \nCourt\u2019s former colleagues with experience at every \nlevel of the federal judiciary say that River\u2019s rule \n\u201cwill lessen the burden on the judicial system as a \nwhole.\u201d Id. 5. \n\n18 \n \nSecond, mid-appeal habeas claims will not create \npiecemeal litigation. Option A: indicative ruling, re-\nmand, and a decision that \u201cmerges with the prior de-\ntermination.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 509. Option B: the \ndistrict court denies the motion because it doesn\u2019t \neven \u201crais[e] a substantial issue\u201d\u2014which also means \nno certificate of appealability. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a72253(c) \n(requiring \u201csubstantial showing\u201d). By contrast, Tex-\nas\u2019s rule will always create piecemeal litigation be-\ncause the court of appeals will need to open a new \noriginal proceeding to review every mid-appeal habe-\nas claim that comes through the door. \nFinality cuts the same way\u2014at least according to \namici who have \u201copposed \u2026 hundreds of petitions for \nwrits of habeas corpus.\u201d Prosecutors\u2019 Br. 1. \u201cThe only \nputative benefit\u201d that Texas\u2019s rule offers states \u201cis to \nmake it harder\u201d for prisoners like Rivers \u201cto obtain \nhabeas relief given AEDPA\u2019s escalating stringency.\u201d \nId. at 6\u20137. \u201cBut procedurally hamstringing a prison-\ner\u2019s amended habeas filing, particularly where the \nnew filing reflects newly discovered evidence, does \nnot serve any legitimate state interest.\u201d Id. at 7. In-\nstead, \u201cthe interests of prosecutors, victims, and the \npublic alike\u201d favor treating such filings as \u201cpart of the \nstill-pending, first-in-time habeas petition.\u201d Id. \nB. Our timing theory also accounts for repose. \nBr. 40\u201341. Texas doesn\u2019t explain why \u00a72244(b) should \ngrant a state repose before the case is final on appeal. \nInstead, it pivots\u2014claiming (at 41) that Congress \nwanted to \u201cprovide States with certainty that the \nuniverse of claims would be closed once an appeal is \nfiled.\u201d Wrong again. Congress granted prisoners the \nchance to appeal, which means that the \u201cuniverse of \nclaims\u201d could always reopen. Subject only to the law-\nof-the-case doctrine and the appellate mandate, \nstates are on notice that a district court \u201cwill permit \n\n19 \n \nnew issues to be presented by an amended pleading\u201d \nif the appellate court reverses or vacates. Wright & \nMiller \u00a71489. Besides, Congress knew how to close \nthe \u201cuniverse of claims,\u201d but it did so only under \nAEDPA\u2019s capital-habeas opt-in chapter. See Br. 23. \nC. Nothing cuts the other way. Texas chiefly warns \n(at 25\u201326) that our approach opens the floodgates to \nabusive habeas claims. If that is true, it\u2019s fair to ask \nwhy Texas still hasn\u2019t found a single case from the \nSecond Circuit saying so. (The lone case it cites, An-\nderson v. Connecticut, 2022 WL 3082985 (D. Conn. \nAug. 3, 2022), addresses a few civil-procedure ques-\ntions and doesn\u2019t beg the Second Circuit to revisit \n\u00a72244(b).) The Second Circuit may see fewer habeas \ncases than the Fifth, but surely its prisoners are no \nless ingenious. For that matter, if the Second Cir-\ncuit\u2019s reading is so unworkable, why aren\u2019t Connecti-\ncut, New York, or Vermont here supporting Texas? In \nall events, Texas never engages with the daunting \nstructural and doctrinal barriers to relief. Br. 44\u201345. \nOur approach is a safety valve\u2014not a magnet\u2014and \nthe valve doesn\u2019t open unless a prisoner can persuade \ntwo courts that remand is warranted. Any \u201cinsurance \npolicy\u201d claims will fail outright, contra Resp. Br. 44\u2013\n45, and prisoners who seek delay can be sanctioned or \ndeemed vexatious filers.  \nIV. Texas\u2019s remaining arguments fail. \nA. Texas\u2019s outlier rule is unworkable. \nTexas wants this Court to adopt an outlier position \nthat only the Sixth Circuit has embraced. The State \ndoesn\u2019t even try to defend the Fifth Circuit\u2019s after-\nfinal-judgment rule. Pet. App. 10a. Instead, it bor-\nrows a few words from Banister and Gonzalez and de-\nclares that a filing is \u201csecond or successive\u201d if it \n\u201cthreatens an already final judgment\u201d or \u201cseeks to re-\n\n20 \n \nvisit\u201d a merits determination. Br. 20 (cleaned up). \nTexas then announces\u2014out of nowhere\u2014that the \u201cdi-\nviding line\u201d between first and successive petitions \u201cis \nthe filing of a notice of appeal.\u201d Id. 28. That is the \nSixth Circuit\u2019s rule, which it adopted solely to \u201crecon-\ncile\u201d circuit precedent. Moreland v. Robinson, 813 \nF.3d 315, 325 (6th Cir. 2016). No other court agrees.  \nNor does Texas explain how district courts are sup-\nposed to administer its \u201crule.\u201d For example, after the \nRule 59(e) window closes, do federal prisoners get an-\nother thirty-two days to file more habeas claims? See \nFed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(B). In the Sixth Circuit, the \nanswer is yes. See Moreland, 813 F.3d at 324. But \nsuch claims would threaten an already final judg-\nment and revisit the merits\u2014so a district court would \nhave to choose between Texas\u2019s ad hoc \u201cdividing line\u201d \nand its \u201crule.\u201d Or consider a timely Rule 59(e) motion \nfiled after the notice of appeal. Is such a filing kosher \n(under Banister) or successive (under Texas\u2019s theory)? \nA district court would have no idea. Meanwhile, our \nrules are clear: \u00a72244(b) doesn\u2019t apply (i) to amend-\nments or (ii) while appeals are pending. \nB. Texas\u2019s vehicle arguments are waived \nand wrong. \nFor the first time, Texas now suggests that what \nRivers filed should not be construed as a motion to \namend. Even if Texas hadn\u2019t forfeited that argument \nbelow and waived it here, it would still be wrong. \nTexas concedes (at 8, 22) that Rivers\u2019s filing over-\nlapped with his first application and sought to \u201cmodi-\nfy\u201d some claims by pleading new facts. By definition, \nthat is a proposed amendment. If any doubt re-\nmained, Rivers clarified the relief he sought before \nthe district court ruled\u2014and just eleven days after \nreceiving the magistrate\u2019s report. 7:21-cv-00012 (N.D. \nTex. Sept. 2, 2021), Dkt. 27, at 10. Texas doesn\u2019t ex-\n\n21 \n \nplain (at 20) why using the prison library\u2019s \u00a72254 \ntemplate changes matters or why Rivers is responsi-\nble for the clerk\u2019s issuing \u201ca new case number.\u201d \nNor can Texas credibly deny (at 44) that the new \nevidence raises questions about Rivers\u2019s convictions. \nAccording to Rivers, the report shows that neither the \nimage nor the video he was convicted of possessing \nwere child pornography. See J.A.69; ROA.4113. While \nTexas may contest the evidence on remand, its claims \nabout the image ring especially hollow. Trial exhibit \n33 lists three files \u201cof [i]nterest\u201d: the two files Rivers \nwas convicted of possessing, plus a false positive. See \nROA.1137\u201338. The report also lists three files \u201cof in-\nterest.\u201d J.A.94. The first file in the report is the first \nfile in the exhibit: the video. The second file in the re-\nport is the second file in the exhibit: the false posi-\ntive. And the third file in the report\u2014labeled \u201cNOT \nCHILD PORN\u201d\u2014matches the exhibit\u2019s description of \nthe image that Rivers was convicted for possessing. If \nTexas thought that its report was talking about a dif-\nferent image, it has had years to say so. \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should reverse and remand. \n\n22 \n \nRespectfully submitted,  \n \n \nPeter A.

My previous actions have likely focused on the petitioner's arguments and the background of the case. This action, searching for the respondent's brief on the merits, is the critical next step to obtain the counterarguments. This brief will detail the State of Texas's legal reasoning for why the Fifth Circuit's decision should be upheld, how it interprets 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b), and how it distinguishes the precedents cited by the petitioner. This information is fundamental to weighing the competing legal theories and predicting the outcome, making the task EIG extremely high. From a design perspective, this action reinforces the core strategy of analyzing both sides of a case. While not a novel step, it provides valuable data on the types of arguments (e.g., textualist, federalism-focused) that respondents believe are persuasive to the current Court in the context of AEDPA. This helps refine the model of what constitutes a winning argument, yielding a moderate design EIG.",

The court below\u2014and the majority of \nthe circuits\u2014have issued decisions fully consistent \nwith this Court\u2019s precedents and with AEDPA\u2019s clear \npurposes. The circuit majority rule minimizes the \nwaste of judicial resources, restricts piecemeal \nlitigation, and promotes the finality of criminal \nconvictions. \nThe \nremaining \ncircuits\u2014a \nsmall \nminority\u2014should self-correct, especially under the \nguidance of this Court\u2019s more recent decision in \nBanister v. Davis, 590 U.S. 504 (2020). Accordingly, \nRivers should be denied certiorari review. \n \nOPINIONS BELOW \n \nThe opinion of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals is \nreported at Rivers v. Lumpkin, 99 F.4th 216 (5th Cir. \n2024). Pet. App. 1a\u201311a. The district court\u2019s order \nadopting the magistrate judge\u2019s findings, conclusions, \nand \nrecommendation \n(Pet. \nApp. \n12a\u201317a), \nis \nunreported. Pet. App. 18a\u201319a. \n \n \nJURISDICTION \n \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment was entered on April \n15, 2024. Pet. App. 1a. This Court has jurisdiction \nunder the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1254(1) and \n2253(c). \n \nSTATUTORY PROVISION INVOLVED \n \nThe Question Presented involves the application of \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(a)\u2013(b): \n \n(a) No circuit or district judge shall be \n\n \n2 \n \nrequired to entertain an application for a \nwrit of habeas corpus to inquire into the \ndetention of a person pursuant to a \njudgment of a court of the United States \nif it appears that the legality of such \ndetention has been determined by a judge \nor court of the United States on a prior \napplication for a writ of habeas corpus, \nexcept as provided in section 2255. \n \n(b)(1) A claim presented in a second or \nsuccessive habeas corpus application \nunder section 2254 that was presented in \na prior application shall be dismissed. \n \n     (2) A claim presented in a second or \nsuccessive habeas corpus application \nunder \nsection \n2254 \nthat \nwas \nnot \npresented in a prior application shall be \ndismissed unless\u2014 \n(A) the applicant shows that the \nclaim relies on a new rule of \nconstitutional \nlaw, \nmade \nretroactive to cases on collateral \nreview by the Supreme Court, that \nwas previously unavailable; or \n(B)(i) the factual predicate for the \nclaim \ncould \nnot \nhave \nbeen \ndiscovered previously through the \nexercise of due diligence; and \n     (ii) the facts underlying the \nclaim, if proven and viewed in light \nof the evidence as a whole, would \nbe sufficient to establish by clear \nand convincing evidence that, but \n\n \n3 \n \nfor \nconstitutional \nerror, \nno \nreasonable factfinder would have \nfound the applicant guilty of the \nunderlying offense. \n \n    (3)(A) Before a second or successive \napplication permitted by this section is \nfiled in the district court, the applicant \nshall move in the appropriate court of \nappeals for an order authorizing the \ndistrict court to consider the application. \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE  \n \nA Texas jury found Rivers guilty of one count of \ncontinuous sexual abuse of a young child (Count I), two \ncounts of indecency with a child by contact (Counts II \nand III), one count of indecency with a child by \nexposure (Count IV), and two counts of possession of \nchild pornography (Counts V and VI). Rivers v. State, \nNo. 08-12-00145-CR, 2014 WL 3662569 (Tex. App.\u2014El \nPaso Jul. 23, 2014, pet. ref\u2019d). Rivers received \nsentences of thirty years\u2019 incarceration for Count I, \nthree years\u2019 incarceration each for Counts II and III, \nand two years\u2019 incarceration for Count IV, all to run \nconsecutively. Id.  He received two concurrent two-year \nsentences for Counts V and VI. Id. \n \n \nAfter exhausting his available state remedies, \nRivers first sought federal habeas relief in August \n2017. Pet. App. 2a. The district court entered final \njudgment and denied Rivers\u2019 claims on the merits in \nSeptember 2018. Id. Rivers appealed from the denial, \nand the Fifth Circuit granted a certificate of \nappealability on his claim that his trial counsel was \n\n \n4 \n \nineffective for failing to conduct a reasonable \ninvestigation and interview witnesses. Id. The Fifth \nCircuit ultimately affirmed the district court\u2019s final \njudgment in May 2022. Pet. App. 3a.  \n \n \nBack in February 2021, while the appeal of his first \npetition was still pending, Rivers filed a second petition \nto challenge the same convictions. Pet. App. 2a. In the \nsecond petition, Rivers reasserted that his trial counsel \nwas ineffective and added a myriad of new claims. Id. \nRivers alleged that the new claims arose from \ninformation he gleaned from his attorney-client file, \nwhich he obtained in October 2019. Id. The district \ncourt found that it lacked jurisdiction over this petition \nbecause it was \u201csecond or successive\u201d to his previous \npetition and transferred it to the Fifth Circuit Pet. App. \n12a\u201319a. Pursuant to the transfer order, an original \nproceeding was docketed in the Fifth Circuit for Rivers \nto file a motion for authorization to file a successive \nhabeas petition. See In re Rivers, No. 21-10967 (5th Cir. \nSep. 24, 2021); see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3). Instead of \nmoving for authorization, Rivers filed a notice of appeal \nchallenging the district court\u2019s transfer order and \nurged the Fifth Circuit to construe his second petition \nas a motion to amend his first petition. Pet. App. 3a\u2013\n4a. The Fifth Circuit dismissed the authorization \nproceeding because Rivers never filed a supporting \nmotion. Order, In re Rivers, No. 21-10967 (5th Cir. Nov. \n15, 2021).  \n \n \nThe Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s \ntransfer order on April 15, 2024, holding that the \nsecond petition was successive and thus subject to the \nrequirements of \u00a7 2244. Pet. App. 11a. Rivers now \nseeks certiorari to challenge that decision. \n\n \n5 \n \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe Court Should Deny Certiorari Because \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s Decision Is Consistent \nwith, and Mandated by, This Court\u2019s Cases. \n \nCertiorari is unwarranted. The Fifth Circuit \ncorrectly held that Rivers\u2019 second petition is an \nunauthorized successive petition subject to the \nrequirements of \u00a7 2244(b). See Pet. App. 11a. This \nholding is consistent with Gonzalez and Banister. See \nGonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524 (2005) (holding that a \npost-judgment filing is a successive habeas petition if \nit advances habeas claims); Banister v. Davis, 590 U.S. \n504 (holding that a motion to amend or alter a \njudgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) \nis not successive because it is part of the final judgment \nin the initial habeas proceeding). \n \n \nThe restrictions on \u201csecond or successive\u201d federal \nhabeas petitions in \u00a7 2244(b) apply to Rivers\u2019 second \npetition because it challenged the same six-count \njudgment of conviction as his initial petition. See \nMagwood v. Patterson, 561 U.S. 320, 331 (2010) \n(holding that \u00a7 2244(b) applies \u201conly to a \u2018second or \nsuccessive\u2019 application challenging the same state-\ncourt judgment.\u201d). The Fifth Circuit properly relied on \nthis Court\u2019s analysis in Gonzalez to determine whether \nRivers\u2019 post-judgment \u201cmotion to amend\u201d his initial \nhabeas petition, i.e., his second habeas petition, was \n\u201csecond or successive\u201d to his initial habeas petition \nunder \u00a7 2244(b). Pet. App. 9a\u201310a (citing Gonzalez, 545 \nU.S. at 531\u201332). The court below found Rivers\u2019 second \npetition to be successive because it was a post-\njudgment filing that advanced habeas claims. Pet. App. \n\n \n6 \n \n9a\u201310a (\u201c[F]ilings introduced after a final judgment \nthat raise habeas claims, no matter how titled, are \ndeemed successive\u201d) (citing Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 531\u2013\n32). Chronology does not end the inquiry, however, as \nthis Court has clarified that not all habeas filings made \nafter an initial application qualify as \u201csecond or \nsuccessive.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 511\u201312; Magwood, \n561 U.S. at 332; Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U.S. 930, \n944 (2007).  \n \n \nThus, relying on Gonzalez, the Fifth Circuit \nproperly looked \u201cat the nature of the relief sought rather \nthan the filing\u2019s label to determine whether failing to \nsubject \n[Rivers\u2019 \nsecond \npetition] \nto \nthe \nsame \nrequirements would be inconsistent with the statute.\u201d \nPet. App. 10a (quoting Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 531) \n(cleaned up) (emphasis added). Although Rivers\u2019 \nsecond petition was characterized as a motion to \namend and not a Rule 60(b) motion, \u201cthat is a \ndistinction without a difference.\u201d Pet. App. 9a\u201310a \n(citing Gonzalez, 545 U.S. 527). His second petition\u2014\nthough \u201ccouched in the language\u201d of a motion to \namend\u2014was properly construed as a successive \npetition because it both \u201cattack[ed] the federal court\u2019s \nresolution of [his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel] \nclaim on the merits\u201d by raising ineffective assistance of \ncounsel yet again and \u201csought to add [] new grounds for \nrelief.\u201d Pet. App. 10a (citing Gonzalez, 545 U.S. 531\u2013\n32). AEDPA afforded Rivers one chance to challenge \nhis convictions, and he availed of that chance with his \ninitial habeas petition. See Magwood, 561 U.S. at 333\u2013\n34. The court below rightly relied on Gonzalez and saw \nRivers\u2019 second petition for what it was: an attempted \nsecond bite of the proverbial apple and thus subject to \nauthorization requirements of \u00a7 2244(b). The transfer \n\n \n7 \n \norder was not only correct; it was mandated. Failure to \nread Rivers\u2019 second petition in tandem with \u00a7 2244 \nwould have \u201ccircumvent[ed] the requirement that a \nsuccessive habeas petition be precertified by the court \nof appeals as falling within an exception to the \nsuccessive-petition bar.\u201d See Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 532 \n(citation and internal quotation omitted). \n \n \nRivers\u2019 complaint that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision \n\u201cignores this Court\u2019s guidance in Banister\u201d is wholly \nnon-sequitur. Pet. Cert. 13. As in Gonzalez, the final \njudgment of the initial habeas proceeding is the crux of \nthe inquiry in Banister. The Court explicitly \ndistinguished a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend a \njudgment as not subject to \u00a7 2244(b) because the \nmotion suspends the finality of the judgment, and the \nruling on the motion merges into the final judgment, \nthus ultimately making the Rule 59(e) motion \u201cpart \nand parcel\u201d of the initial habeas proceeding. Banister, \n590 U.S. at 507\u201309. This Court\u2019s holding in Gonzalez \nthat a post-judgment filing \u201ccounts as a second or \nsuccessive habeas application if it \u2018attacks the federal \ncourt\u2019s previous resolution of a claim on the merits\u2019 . . . \ndoes not alter that conclusion.\u201d Id. at 505 (citing \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. 532).  \n \n \nLike a Rule 60(b) motion that advances habeas \nclaims and would thus unequivocally count as a \nsuccessive petition, Rivers\u2019 second petition \u201cdiffers \nfrom a Rule 59(e) [motion] in just about every way that \nmatters to the inquiry here.\u201d See Banister, 590 U.S. at \n516. That is, Rivers\u2019 second petition is unlike a Rule \n59(e) motion in timing, scope, and procedural posture. \nA Rule 59(e) motion must be brought within 28 days of \nfinal judgment and requests only \u201creconsideration of \n\n \n8 \n \nmatters properly encompassed\u201d in the challenged \njudgment. Id. at 516. It is a \u201cone-time effort to bring \nalleged errors in a just-issued decision to a habeas \ncourt\u2019s attention, before taking a single appeal.\u201d Id. \nDespite Rivers\u2019 wishes, his second petition cannot be \ntreated akin to a Rule 59(e) motion as \u201cpart and parcel\u201d \nof his initial habeas proceeding because it was: (1) filed \nin a new, separately numbered district court \nproceeding; (2) more than 28 days after final judgment; \nand (3) exceeded the scope of claims that were raised \nin his initial petition. \n \n \nIn sum, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision comports with \nboth Gonzalez and Banister. Certiorari is unwarranted \nbecause this Court has provided sufficient guidance as \nto what constitutes a successive petition, and the lower \ncourt\u2019s analysis correctly relied on that guidance. The \nonly legally available way to merge Rivers\u2019 new habeas \nclaims \ninto \nhis \nfirst-in-time \npetition\u2019s \nalready \ncompleted judgment is a Rule 60(b) motion, which this \nCourt in Gonzalez already established would be a \nsuccessive petition. \n \nII. \nThe Court Should Deny Certiorari Because \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s Decision Is Consistent \nwith AEDPA\u2019s Aims. \n \nRivers argues that the lower court was wrong \nbecause its approach \u201cwould frustrate AEDPA\u2019s aims.\u201d \nPet. Cert. 27. His arguments have no force because he \ndisregards Congress\u2019 intent in enacting \u00a7 2244(b). \nOddly enough, Rivers faults the Fifth Circuit for not \nasking whether his filing \u201cwould have constituted an \nabuse of the writ,\u201d as the historical doctrine is \nexplained in Banister. Pet. Cert. 30 (citing Banister, \n\n \n9 \n \n590 U.S. at 512) (cleaned up). In doing so, Rivers \nsuggests that the abuse-of-the-writ doctrine should \nsupplant \u00a7 2244(b) as gatekeeper. However, this Court \nhas previously explained that the text of AEDPA as \nwritten\u2014and not pre-AEDPA doctrines like abuse of \nthe writ\u2014controls whether a filing is successive. See \nMagwood, 561 U.S. at 338 (\u201cIn light of this complex \nhistory of the phrase \u2018second or successive,\u2019 we must \nrely upon the current text to determine when the \nphrase applies, rather than pre-AEDPA precedents or \nsuperseded statutory formulations.\u201d).  \n \n \nMoreover, the debate over AEDPA reveals that \nCongress likely intended to override the pre-AEDPA \nlegal standards such as abuse of the writ. See, e.g., 141 \nCong. Rec. 15047 (1995) (\u201cWe are into that school that \nsays . . . drastically curtail the time within which \nsomeone is able to file a habeas petition and how many \ntimes they are able to file one and what constitutes a \nsuccessive petition\u201d); accord id. at 15054\u2013055 (\u201c[S]ome \nreform of habeas corpus is necessary. . . . I support \nlimits on successive, repetitive petitions.\u201d). The \nhistorical \nabuse-of-the-writ \ndoctrine \n\u201cwas \nmore \nforgiving than AEDPA\u2019s gatekeeping provision\u201d to the \nextent that successive petitions were a persistent, \nrecurring issue prior to AEDPA\u2019s enactment. See \nBanister, 590 U.S. at 514 (citing McCleskey v. Zant, 499 \nU.S. 467, 485 (1991)); 141 Cong. Rec. 15039 (\u201c[T]he \ncourt as well as the Congress has found that the writs \nof habeas corpus . . . the petition, more accurately, \nseeking a writ, has been used excessively. This has \nbeen happening for many, many years.\u201d). It thus \nfollows that more stringent amendment to \u00a7 2244(b) \nwas Congress\u2019 solution to curtail the problem of \nsuccessive habeas petitions, to serve as gatekeeper \n\n \n10 \n \nwhere the abuse-of-the-writ doctrine failed. The Fifth \nCircuit did not consider whether Rivers\u2019 second \npetition constituted abuse of the writ because the text \nof \u00a7 2244, not abuse of the writ, was the relevant \ninquiry. \n \nA. Congress determined that the application \nof AEDPA\u2019s successive bar conserves \njudicial \nresources, \nwhile \npre-AEDPA \ndoctrines wasted them. \n \nRivers suggests that the procedural impediments of \n\u00a7 2244(b) are, in of themselves, inefficient at conserving \njudicial resources. See Pet. Cert. 27\u201330 (\u201cIf section \n2244(b)(2) is a \u2018rock[y]\u2019 path for prisoners, that goes \ndouble for courts.\u201d) (quoting Banister, 590 U.S. at 509). \nIn other words, he suggests that the plain text of \n\u00a7 2244(b) should not control because the historical pre-\nAEDPA doctrines such as abuse of the writ better \nconserved judicial resources. See id. at 30 (\u201cHad \nCongress wanted all post-judgment habeas filings to \ncount as second or successive petitions, it easily could \nhave written such a law. But it\u2019s hard to squeeze that \nrule from the text of \u00a7 2244(b)(2) and the history \nagainst which it was written.\u201d).  \n \nBut Rivers\u2019 argument is inapposite, because \nCongress concluded that the pre-AEDPA legal \nstandards were inefficient and wasted judicial \nresources. Rivers cannot take issue with Congress\u2019 \npolicy determinations, and neither should the Court. \nSee Felker v. Turpin, 518 U.S. 651, 664 (1996) (\u201c[W]e \nhave likewise recognized that judgments about the \nproper scope of the writ are normally for Congress to \nmake.\u201d). Furthermore, Rivers ignores the fact that a \n\n \n11 \n \ncircuit court\u2019s authorization decision is not itself an \n\u201cappeal,\u201d and cannot be further appealed, either en \nbanc or to this Court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(E) (\u201cThe \ngrant or denial of an authorization by a court of appeals \nto file a second or successive application shall not be \nappealable and shall not be the subject of a petition for \nrehearing or for a writ of certiorari.\u201d). Because this \nlimitation represents the \u201cmaximum\u201d conservation of \njudicial resources, as contemplated by Congress, \nRivers\u2019 arguments necessarily expend more judicial \nresources in comparison. \n \n \nMoreover, it cannot follow that the district court \nshould have issued an indicative ruling on his second \npetition under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62.1 if \nit found that Rivers \u201cnew evidence was [not] worth the \ncandle.\u201d Pet. Cert. 29 (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 62.1). It \nwas the prerogative of the Fifth Circuit to assess the \nbasis of Rivers\u2019 new claims, had he complied with \nAEDPA\u2019s mandate that he move for authorization. See \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b). Such an analysis under \u00a7 2244(b) \nsupplants the ruling Rivers desired under Rule 62.1. \nAs this Court in Banister admonished, the restrictions \nof \u00a7 2244(b), \u201clike all statutes and rules pertaining to \nhabeas, trump any \u2018inconsistent\u2019 Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure \notherwise \napplicable \nto \nhabeas \nproceedings.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 509. This \nargument, too, falters. \n \n \n\n \n12 \n \nB. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s application of \u00a7 2244(b) \ndecreases piecemeal litigation.  \n \n \nRivers argues that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s approach \nincreases piecemeal litigation because the district \ncourt should have considered his second petition on the \nmerits rather than transfer it to the Fifth Circuit. Pet. \nCert. 29. Rivers again suggests that the procedural \nimpediments \nof \n\u00a7 \n2244(b) \nthemselves \npromote \npiecemeal litigation. First, Rivers\u2019 argument fails to \nacknowledge that the district court lacked authority to \nreopen the judgment while the denial of his first \npetition remained pending on appeal because it had no \njurisdiction to consider an \u201camended\u201d petition. Second, \nthe only way Rivers could have reopened the judgment \nto amend his first petition more than 28 days after final \njudgment would have been a Rule 60(b) motion, which \nwould be plainly successive under Gonzalez because it \nincreases piecemeal litigation.   \n \nC. Congress intended for AEDPA and its \nsuccessive bar to promote finality.  \n \n \nRivers argues that if the evidence that formed the \nbasis of his new claims \u201cisn\u2019t the bombshell that Rivers \nreckons,\u201d the district court should have denied the \nclaims in his second petition on the merits. Pet. Cert. \n29 (\u201cHad it done that, this case would be over.\u201d). But \nbecause the district court lacked jurisdiction to \nconsider the second petition, \u00a7 2244(b) required that \nthe court transfer it to the Fifth Circuit. Yet again, he \nsuggests that the procedural requirements of \u00a7 2244(b) \nare themselves impediments to conviction finality. Id. \nat 29\u201330 (\u201cInstead, the lower courts sent Rivers and \nTexas down a path that could prolong this case.\u201d).  \n\n \n13 \n \n \nIn enacting \u00a7 2244(b), Congress \u201caimed to prevent \nserial challenges to a judgment of conviction.\u201d Banister, \n590 U.S. at 515. Yet Rivers\u2019 proposed approach would \nallow petitioners to make an infinite number of post-\njudgment \u201camendments\u201d to an initial petition so long \nas that petition remains pending on appeal. See id. at \n521. Allowing petitioners to raise habeas claims ad \ninfinitum during the post-judgment pendency of the \ninitial petition runs contrary to \u00a7 2244(b)\u2019s purpose to \n\u201c\u2018conserve judicial resources, reduc[e] piecemeal \nlitigation,\u2019 and \u2018lend[ ] finality to state court judgments \nwithin a reasonable time.\u2019\u201d Id. at 512 (citing Panetti, \n551 U.S. at 945\u201346). In sum, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision \nbelow aligns with AEDPA and Congress\u2019 intent \ntherein. \n \nIII. \nThe Decision Below Is Fully Consistent \nwith the Majority of Circuit Courts to Have \nAddressed This Issue; the Court Should \nDeny Certiorari to Allow the Minority \nCircuits to Self-Correct. \n \nThe rule followed by the majority of circuits is \ncorrect, for the reasons explained above. The Fifth \nCircuit, along with the Fourth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, \nand Eleventh Circuits, all agree that an initial habeas \nproceeding is \u201cconcluded\u201d once the district court has \nissued a final judgment, regardless of a pending \nappeal; any later attempts to advance habeas claims \nare deemed succe\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n43: 20241015114816247_23-134520Rivers20Word20Count20Cert.json (score: 0.429)\nNo. 23-1345 \n \n \nIN THE \nSupreme Court of the United States \n \nDANNY RICHARD RIVERS, \nPetitioner, \nv. \n \nBOBBY LUMPKIN, DIRECTOR, TDCJ-CID,  \nRespondent. \n \nOn Petition for a Writ of Certiorari \nTo the Fifth Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit \n \nRESPONDENT\u2019S WORD COUNT CERTIFICATION \n \n \nAs required by Supreme Court Rule 33.1(h), I certify that the document \ncontains 3,965 words, excluding the parts of the document that are exempted \nby Supreme Court Rule 33.1(d).

The court below\u2014and the majority of \nthe circuits\u2014have issued decisions fully consistent \nwith this Court\u2019s precedents and with AEDPA\u2019s clear \npurposes. The circuit majority rule minimizes the \nwaste of judicial resources, restricts piecemeal \nlitigation, and promotes the finality of criminal \nconvictions. \nThe \nremaining \ncircuits\u2014a \nsmall \nminority\u2014should self-correct, especially under the \nguidance of this Court\u2019s more recent decision in \nBanister v. Davis, 590 U.S. 504 (2020). Accordingly, \nRivers should be denied certiorari review. \n \nOPINIONS BELOW \n \nThe opinion of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals is \nreported at Rivers v.

This Court has jurisdiction \nunder the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1254(1) and \n2253(c). \n \nSTATUTORY PROVISION INVOLVED \n \nThe Question Presented involves the application of \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(a)\u2013(b): \n \n(a) No circuit or district judge shall be \n\n \n2 \n \nrequired to entertain an application for a \nwrit of habeas corpus to inquire into the \ndetention of a person pursuant to a \njudgment of a court of the United States \nif it appears that the legality of such \ndetention has been determined by a judge \nor court of the United States on a prior \napplication for a writ of habeas corpus, \nexcept as provided in section 2255. \n \n(b)(1) A claim presented in a second or \nsuccessive habeas corpus application \nunder section 2254 that was presented in \na prior application shall be dismissed. \n \n     (2) A claim presented in a second or \nsuccessive habeas corpus application \nunder \nsection \n2254 \nthat \nwas \nnot \npresented in a prior application shall be \ndismissed unless\u2014 \n(A) the applicant shows that the \nclaim relies on a new rule of \nconstitutional \nlaw, \nmade \nretroactive to cases on collateral \nreview by the Supreme Court, that \nwas previously unavailable; or \n(B)(i) the factual predicate for the \nclaim \ncould \nnot \nhave \nbeen \ndiscovered previously through the \nexercise of due diligence; and \n     (ii) the facts underlying the \nclaim, if proven and viewed in light \nof the evidence as a whole, would \nbe sufficient to establish by clear \nand convincing evidence that, but \n\n \n3 \n \nfor \nconstitutional \nerror, \nno \nreasonable factfinder would have \nfound the applicant guilty of the \nunderlying offense. \n \n    (3)(A) Before a second or successive \napplication permitted by this section is \nfiled in the district court, the applicant \nshall move in the appropriate court of \nappeals for an order authorizing the \ndistrict court to consider the application. \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE  \n \nA Texas jury found Rivers guilty of one count of \ncontinuous sexual abuse of a young child (Count I), two \ncounts of indecency with a child by contact (Counts II \nand III), one count of indecency with a child by \nexposure (Count IV), and two counts of possession of \nchild pornography (Counts V and VI). Rivers v. State, \nNo. 08-12-00145-CR, 2014 WL 3662569 (Tex. App.\u2014El \nPaso Jul. 23, 2014, pet. ref\u2019d). Rivers received \nsentences of thirty years\u2019 incarceration for Count I, \nthree years\u2019 incarceration each for Counts II and III, \nand two years\u2019 incarceration for Count IV, all to run \nconsecutively. Id.  He received two concurrent two-year \nsentences for Counts V and VI. Id. \n \n \nAfter exhausting his available state remedies, \nRivers first sought federal habeas relief in August \n2017. Pet. App. 2a. The district court entered final \njudgment and denied Rivers\u2019 claims on the merits in \nSeptember 2018. Id. Rivers appealed from the denial, \nand the Fifth Circuit granted a certificate of \nappealability on his claim that his trial counsel was \n\n \n4 \n \nineffective for failing to conduct a reasonable \ninvestigation and interview witnesses. Id. The Fifth \nCircuit ultimately affirmed the district court\u2019s final \njudgment in May 2022. Pet. App. 3a.  \n \n \nBack in February 2021, while the appeal of his first \npetition was still pending, Rivers filed a second petition \nto challenge the same convictions. Pet. App. 2a. In the \nsecond petition, Rivers reasserted that his trial counsel \nwas ineffective and added a myriad of new claims. Id. \nRivers alleged that the new claims arose from \ninformation he gleaned from his attorney-client file, \nwhich he obtained in October 2019. Id. The district \ncourt found that it lacked jurisdiction over this petition \nbecause it was \u201csecond or successive\u201d to his previous \npetition and transferred it to the Fifth Circuit Pet. App. \n12a\u201319a. Pursuant to the transfer order, an original \nproceeding was docketed in the Fifth Circuit for Rivers \nto file a motion for authorization to file a successive \nhabeas petition. See In re Rivers, No. 21-10967 (5th Cir. \nSep. 24, 2021); see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3). Instead of \nmoving for authorization, Rivers filed a notice of appeal \nchallenging the district court\u2019s transfer order and \nurged the Fifth Circuit to construe his second petition \nas a motion to amend his first petition. Pet. App. 3a\u2013\n4a. The Fifth Circuit dismissed the authorization \nproceeding because Rivers never filed a supporting \nmotion. Order, In re Rivers, No. 21-10967 (5th Cir. Nov. \n15, 2021).  \n \n \nThe Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s \ntransfer order on April 15, 2024, holding that the \nsecond petition was successive and thus subject to the \nrequirements of \u00a7 2244. Pet. App. 11a. Rivers now \nseeks certiorari to challenge that decision. \n\n \n5 \n \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe Court Should Deny Certiorari Because \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s Decision Is Consistent \nwith, and Mandated by, This Court\u2019s Cases. \n \nCertiorari is unwarranted. The Fifth Circuit \ncorrectly held that Rivers\u2019 second petition is an \nunauthorized successive petition subject to the \nrequirements of \u00a7 2244(b). See Pet. App. 11a. This \nholding is consistent with Gonzalez and Banister. See \nGonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524 (2005) (holding that a \npost-judgment filing is a successive habeas petition if \nit advances habeas claims); Banister v. Davis, 590 U.S. \n504 (holding that a motion to amend or alter a \njudgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) \nis not successive because it is part of the final judgment \nin the initial habeas proceeding). \n \n \nThe restrictions on \u201csecond or successive\u201d federal \nhabeas petitions in \u00a7 2244(b) apply to Rivers\u2019 second \npetition because it challenged the same six-count \njudgment of conviction as his initial petition. See \nMagwood v. Patterson, 561 U.S. 320, 331 (2010) \n(holding that \u00a7 2244(b) applies \u201conly to a \u2018second or \nsuccessive\u2019 application challenging the same state-\ncourt judgment.\u201d). The Fifth Circuit properly relied on \nthis Court\u2019s analysis in Gonzalez to determine whether \nRivers\u2019 post-judgment \u201cmotion to amend\u201d his initial \nhabeas petition, i.e., his second habeas petition, was \n\u201csecond or successive\u201d to his initial habeas petition \nunder \u00a7 2244(b). Pet. App. 9a\u201310a (citing Gonzalez, 545 \nU.S. at 531\u201332). The court below found Rivers\u2019 second \npetition to be successive because it was a post-\njudgment filing that advanced habeas claims. Pet. App. \n\n \n6 \n \n9a\u201310a (\u201c[F]ilings introduced after a final judgment \nthat raise habeas claims, no matter how titled, are \ndeemed successive\u201d) (citing Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 531\u2013\n32). Chronology does not end the inquiry, however, as \nthis Court has clarified that not all habeas filings made \nafter an initial application qualify as \u201csecond or \nsuccessive.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 511\u201312; Magwood, \n561 U.S. at 332; Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U.S. 930, \n944 (2007).  \n \n \nThus, relying on Gonzalez, the Fifth Circuit \nproperly looked \u201cat the nature of the relief sought rather \nthan the filing\u2019s label to determine whether failing to \nsubject \n[Rivers\u2019 \nsecond \npetition] \nto \nthe \nsame \nrequirements would be inconsistent with the statute.\u201d \nPet. App. 10a (quoting Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 531) \n(cleaned up) (emphasis added). Although Rivers\u2019 \nsecond petition was characterized as a motion to \namend and not a Rule 60(b) motion, \u201cthat is a \ndistinction without a difference.\u201d Pet. App. 9a\u201310a \n(citing Gonzalez, 545 U.S. 527). His second petition\u2014\nthough \u201ccouched in the language\u201d of a motion to \namend\u2014was properly construed as a successive \npetition because it both \u201cattack[ed] the federal court\u2019s \nresolution of [his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel] \nclaim on the merits\u201d by raising ineffective assistance of \ncounsel yet again and \u201csought to add [] new grounds for \nrelief.\u201d Pet. App. 10a (citing Gonzalez, 545 U.S. 531\u2013\n32). AEDPA afforded Rivers one chance to challenge \nhis convictions, and he availed of that chance with his \ninitial habeas petition. See Magwood, 561 U.S. at 333\u2013\n34. The court below rightly relied on Gonzalez and saw \nRivers\u2019 second petition for what it was: an attempted \nsecond bite of the proverbial apple and thus subject to \nauthorization requirements of \u00a7 2244(b). The transfer \n\n \n7 \n \norder was not only correct; it was mandated. Failure to \nread Rivers\u2019 second petition in tandem with \u00a7 2244 \nwould have \u201ccircumvent[ed] the requirement that a \nsuccessive habeas petition be precertified by the court \nof appeals as falling within an exception to the \nsuccessive-petition bar.\u201d See Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 532 \n(citation and internal quotation omitted). \n \n \nRivers\u2019 complaint that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision \n\u201cignores this Court\u2019s guidance in Banister\u201d is wholly \nnon-sequitur. Pet. Cert. 13. As in Gonzalez, the final \njudgment of the initial habeas proceeding is the crux of \nthe inquiry in Banister. The Court explicitly \ndistinguished a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend a \njudgment as not subject to \u00a7 2244(b) because the \nmotion suspends the finality of the judgment, and the \nruling on the motion merges into the final judgment, \nthus ultimately making the Rule 59(e) motion \u201cpart \nand parcel\u201d of the initial habeas proceeding. Banister, \n590 U.S. at 507\u201309. This Court\u2019s holding in Gonzalez \nthat a post-judgment filing \u201ccounts as a second or \nsuccessive habeas application if it \u2018attacks the federal \ncourt\u2019s previous resolution of a claim on the merits\u2019 . . . \ndoes not alter that conclusion.\u201d Id. at 505 (citing \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. 532).  \n \n \nLike a Rule 60(b) motion that advances habeas \nclaims and would thus unequivocally count as a \nsuccessive petition, Rivers\u2019 second petition \u201cdiffers \nfrom a Rule 59(e) [motion] in just about every way that \nmatters to the inquiry here.\u201d See Banister, 590 U.S. at \n516. That is, Rivers\u2019 second petition is unlike a Rule \n59(e) motion in timing, scope, and procedural posture. \nA Rule 59(e) motion must be brought within 28 days of \nfinal judgment and requests only \u201creconsideration of \n\n \n8 \n \nmatters properly encompassed\u201d in the challenged \njudgment. Id. at 516. It is a \u201cone-time effort to bring \nalleged errors in a just-issued decision to a habeas \ncourt\u2019s attention, before taking a single appeal.\u201d Id. \nDespite Rivers\u2019 wishes, his second petition cannot be \ntreated akin to a Rule 59(e) motion as \u201cpart and parcel\u201d \nof his initial habeas proceeding because it was: (1) filed \nin a new, separately numbered district court \nproceeding; (2) more than 28 days after final judgment; \nand (3) exceeded the scope of claims that were raised \nin his initial petition. \n \n \nIn sum, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision comports with \nboth Gonzalez and Banister. Certiorari is unwarranted \nbecause this Court has provided sufficient guidance as \nto what constitutes a successive petition, and the lower \ncourt\u2019s analysis correctly relied on that guidance. The \nonly legally available way to merge Rivers\u2019 new habeas \nclaims \ninto \nhis \nfirst-in-time \npetition\u2019s \nalready \ncompleted judgment is a Rule 60(b) motion, which this \nCourt in Gonzalez already established would be a \nsuccessive petition. \n \nII. \nThe Court Should Deny Certiorari Because \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s Decision Is Consistent \nwith AEDPA\u2019s Aims. \n \nRivers argues that the lower court was wrong \nbecause its approach \u201cwould frustrate AEDPA\u2019s aims.\u201d \nPet. Cert. 27. His arguments have no force because he \ndisregards Congress\u2019 intent in enacting \u00a7 2244(b). \nOddly enough, Rivers faults the Fifth Circuit for not \nasking whether his filing \u201cwould have constituted an \nabuse of the writ,\u201d as the historical doctrine is \nexplained in Banister. Pet. Cert. 30 (citing Banister, \n\n \n9 \n \n590 U.S. at 512) (cleaned up). In doing so, Rivers \nsuggests that the abuse-of-the-writ doctrine should \nsupplant \u00a7 2244(b) as gatekeeper. However, this Court \nhas previously explained that the text of AEDPA as \nwritten\u2014and not pre-AEDPA doctrines like abuse of \nthe writ\u2014controls whether a filing is successive. See \nMagwood, 561 U.S. at 338 (\u201cIn light of this complex \nhistory of the phrase \u2018second or successive,\u2019 we must \nrely upon the current text to determine when the \nphrase applies, rather than pre-AEDPA precedents or \nsuperseded statutory formulations.\u201d).  \n \n \nMoreover, the debate over AEDPA reveals that \nCongress likely intended to override the pre-AEDPA \nlegal standards such as abuse of the writ. See, e.g., 141 \nCong. Rec. 15047 (1995) (\u201cWe are into that school that \nsays . . . drastically curtail the time within which \nsomeone is able to file a habeas petition and how many \ntimes they are able to file one and what constitutes a \nsuccessive petition\u201d); accord id. at 15054\u2013055 (\u201c[S]ome \nreform of habeas corpus is necessary. . . . I support \nlimits on successive, repetitive petitions.\u201d). The \nhistorical \nabuse-of-the-writ \ndoctrine \n\u201cwas \nmore \nforgiving than AEDPA\u2019s gatekeeping provision\u201d to the \nextent that successive petitions were a persistent, \nrecurring issue prior to AEDPA\u2019s enactment. See \nBanister, 590 U.S. at 514 (citing McCleskey v. Zant, 499 \nU.S. 467, 485 (1991)); 141 Cong. Rec. 15039 (\u201c[T]he \ncourt as well as the Congress has found that the writs \nof habeas corpus . . . the petition, more accurately, \nseeking a writ, has been used excessively. This has \nbeen happening for many, many years.\u201d). It thus \nfollows that more stringent amendment to \u00a7 2244(b) \nwas Congress\u2019 solution to curtail the problem of \nsuccessive habeas petitions, to serve as gatekeeper \n\n \n10 \n \nwhere the abuse-of-the-writ doctrine failed. The Fifth \nCircuit did not consider whether Rivers\u2019 second \npetition constituted abuse of the writ because the text \nof \u00a7 2244, not abuse of the writ, was the relevant \ninquiry. \n \nA. Congress determined that the application \nof AEDPA\u2019s successive bar conserves \njudicial \nresources, \nwhile \npre-AEDPA \ndoctrines wasted them. \n \nRivers suggests that the procedural impediments of \n\u00a7 2244(b) are, in of themselves, inefficient at conserving \njudicial resources. See Pet. Cert. 27\u201330 (\u201cIf section \n2244(b)(2) is a \u2018rock[y]\u2019 path for prisoners, that goes \ndouble for courts.\u201d) (quoting Banister, 590 U.S. at 509). \nIn other words, he suggests that the plain text of \n\u00a7 2244(b) should not control because the historical pre-\nAEDPA doctrines such as abuse of the writ better \nconserved judicial resources. See id. at 30 (\u201cHad \nCongress wanted all post-judgment habeas filings to \ncount as second or successive petitions, it easily could \nhave written such a law. But it\u2019s hard to squeeze that \nrule from the text of \u00a7 2244(b)(2) and the history \nagainst which it was written.\u201d).  \n \nBut Rivers\u2019 argument is inapposite, because \nCongress concluded that the pre-AEDPA legal \nstandards were inefficient and wasted judicial \nresources. Rivers cannot take issue with Congress\u2019 \npolicy determinations, and neither should the Court. \nSee Felker v. Turpin, 518 U.S. 651, 664 (1996) (\u201c[W]e \nhave likewise recognized that judgments about the \nproper scope of the writ are normally for Congress to \nmake.\u201d). Furthermore, Rivers ignores the fact that a \n\n \n11 \n \ncircuit court\u2019s authorization decision is not itself an \n\u201cappeal,\u201d and cannot be further appealed, either en \nbanc or to this Court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(E) (\u201cThe \ngrant or denial of an authorization by a court of appeals \nto file a second or successive application shall not be \nappealable and shall not be the subject of a petition for \nrehearing or for a writ of certiorari.\u201d). Because this \nlimitation represents the \u201cmaximum\u201d conservation of \njudicial resources, as contemplated by Congress, \nRivers\u2019 arguments necessarily expend more judicial \nresources in comparison. \n \n \nMoreover, it cannot follow that the district court \nshould have issued an indicative ruling on his second \npetition under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62.1 if \nit found that Rivers \u201cnew evidence was [not] worth the \ncandle.\u201d Pet. Cert. 29 (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 62.1). It \nwas the prerogative of the Fifth Circuit to assess the \nbasis of Rivers\u2019 new claims, had he complied with \nAEDPA\u2019s mandate that he move for authorization. See \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b). Such an analysis under \u00a7 2244(b) \nsupplants the ruling Rivers desired under Rule 62.1. \nAs this Court in Banister admonished, the restrictions \nof \u00a7 2244(b), \u201clike all statutes and rules pertaining to \nhabeas, trump any \u2018inconsistent\u2019 Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure \notherwise \napplicable \nto \nhabeas \nproceedings.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 509. This \nargument, too, falters. \n \n \n\n \n12 \n \nB. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s application of \u00a7 2244(b) \ndecreases piecemeal litigation.  \n \n \nRivers argues that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s approach \nincreases piecemeal litigation because the district \ncourt should have considered his second petition on the \nmerits rather than transfer it to the Fifth Circuit. Pet. \nCert. 29. Rivers again suggests that the procedural \nimpediments \nof \n\u00a7 \n2244(b) \nthemselves \npromote \npiecemeal litigation. First, Rivers\u2019 argument fails to \nacknowledge that the district court lacked authority to \nreopen the judgment while the denial of his first \npetition remained pending on appeal because it had no \njurisdiction to consider an \u201camended\u201d petition. Second, \nthe only way Rivers could have reopened the judgment \nto amend his first petition more than 28 days after final \njudgment would have been a Rule 60(b) motion, which \nwould be plainly successive under Gonzalez because it \nincreases piecemeal litigation.   \n \nC. Congress intended for AEDPA and its \nsuccessive bar to promote finality.  \n \n \nRivers argues that if the evidence that formed the \nbasis of his new claims \u201cisn\u2019t the bombshell that Rivers \nreckons,\u201d the district court should have denied the \nclaims in his second petition on the merits. Pet. Cert. \n29 (\u201cHad it done that, this case would be over.\u201d). But \nbecause the district court lacked jurisdiction to \nconsider the second petition, \u00a7 2244(b) required that \nthe court transfer it to the Fifth Circuit. Yet again, he \nsuggests that the procedural requirements of \u00a7 2244(b) \nare themselves impediments to conviction finality. Id. \nat 29\u201330 (\u201cInstead, the lower courts sent Rivers and \nTexas down a path that could prolong this case.\u201d).  \n\n \n13 \n \n \nIn enacting \u00a7 2244(b), Congress \u201caimed to prevent \nserial challenges to a judgment of conviction.\u201d Banister, \n590 U.S. at 515. Yet Rivers\u2019 proposed approach would \nallow petitioners to make an infinite number of post-\njudgment \u201camendments\u201d to an initial petition so long \nas that petition remains pending on appeal. See id. at \n521. Allowing petitioners to raise habeas claims ad \ninfinitum during the post-judgment pendency of the \ninitial petition runs contrary to \u00a7 2244(b)\u2019s purpose to \n\u201c\u2018conserve judicial resources, reduc[e] piecemeal \nlitigation,\u2019 and \u2018lend[ ] finality to state court judgments \nwithin a reasonable time.\u2019\u201d Id. at 512 (citing Panetti, \n551 U.S. at 945\u201346). In sum, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision \nbelow aligns with AEDPA and Congress\u2019 intent \ntherein. \n \nIII. \nThe Decision Below Is Fully Consistent \nwith the Majority of Circuit Courts to Have \nAddressed This Issue; the Court Should \nDeny Certiorari to Allow the Minority \nCircuits to Self-Correct. \n \nThe rule followed by the majority of circuits is \ncorrect, for the reasons explained above. The Fifth \nCircuit, along with the Fourth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, \nand Eleventh Circuits, all agree that an initial habeas \nproceeding is \u201cconcluded\u201d once the district court has \nissued a final judgment, regardless of a pending \nappeal; any later attempts to advance habeas claims \nare deemed successive under \u00a7 2244(b). See Bixby v. \nStirling, 90 F.4th 140 (4th Cir. 2024); Phillips v. United \nStates, 668 F.3d 433, 435 (7th Cir. 2012); Williams v. \nNorris, 461 F.3d 999, 1003 (8th Cir. 2006); Beaty v. \nSchriro, 554 F.3d 780, 783 n.1 (9th Cir. 2009); Ochoa v. \nSirmons, 485 F.3d 538, 540 (10th Cir. 2007); Boyd v. \n\n \n14 \n \nSec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corr., 114 F.4th 1232, 1239 (11th Cir. \n2024). \n \n \nThe Fourth and Eleventh Circuits most recently \nissued clear decisions aligning with the majority view. \nBixby, 90 F.4th at 146\u201350 (relying on Gonzalez, the \nFourth Circuit determined this year that under \nAEDPA, only it may authorize a second or successive \nhabeas petition); Boyd, 114 F.4th at 1239 (finding that, \neven if filed during an appeal for an adjudicated \n\u201cearlier application,\u201d a habeas petition or motion \u201cthat \npresents new evidence in support of a claim\u201d should be \ndeemed \nsuccessive \nand \n\u201c\u2018treated \naccordingly.\u2019\u201d) \n(quoting Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 531). This position\u2014\nthat upon a final judgment by the district court, if a \npetitioner wishes to present new claims or new \nevidence for old claims during the pendency of an \nappeal, AEDPA grants only the circuit courts the \npower to authorize. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). \n \n \nThe Seventh Circuit, along with the Eighth and \nNinth, have had long-standing views on this issue, \nfinding that upon an appeal, a habeas petitioner\u2019s \nadditional claims would be successive. Phillips, 668 \nF.3d at 435; Williams v. Norris, 461 F.3d at 1003; Beaty \nv. Schriro, 554 F.3d at 783 n.1. As the Seventh Circuit \nwarned, ruling otherwise would allow a petitioner to \n\u201cfile[] an entirely independent \u00a7 2255 petition raising a \ndistinct claim of relief; indeed, he could still file one or \nmore, as many as he likes, because this appeal is not \nover.\u201d Phillips, 668 F.3d at 435. As such, \u201c[t]reating \nmotions filed during appeal as part of the original \napplication,\u201d would potentially \u201cdrain most force from \nthe time-and-number limits,\u201d of AEDPA. Id. A district \n\n \n15 \n \ncourt\u2019s final judgment, therefore, must \u201cmark[] the \nterminal point.\u201d Id. \n \n \nBy contrast, only the Second and Third Circuits \nhave ruled that a petition is not successive if filed \nduring the pendency of the initial petition\u2019s appeal.  \nWhab v. United States, 408 F.3d 116, 118 (2d Cir. \n2005); United States v. Santarelli, 929 F.3d 95, 106 (3d \nCir. 2019) (holding that a prior proceeding has not \nconcluded for purposes of \u00a7 2244(b) until all appeals \nhave been exhausted.).  \n \n \nTo strengthen his circuit-split argument, Rivers \nasserts that the Tenth Circuit applies a \u201cseven-factor \ntest\u201d to determine if a petitioner may supplement an \ninitial petition before the district court rendered \njudgment. Pet. Cert. 19\u201320. In Douglas v. Workman, \n560 F.3d 1156 (10th Cir. 2009), the Tenth Circuit \ncarved out an exception for prosecutorial misconduct \nclaims to its normal rule concerning AEDPA\u2019s bar of \nsuccessive petitions. Specifically, when the \u201cprosecutor \nacted \nwillfully, \nand \nnot \njust \nnegligently \nor \ninadvertently, \nhis \nconduct \nwarrants \nspecial \ncondemnation and justifies permitting [the petitioner] \nto supplement his initial habeas petition.\u201d Id. at 1190. \nThat court then laid out \u201cseven factors on which [it \nbased \nits] \nconclusion\u201d \nthat \na \npetitioner \nmay \nsupplement. Id. at 1190\u201396. But to be clear, the Tenth \nCircuit has explicitly declined to follow the Second \nCircuit\u2019s position detailed in Whab, 408 F.3d 116, for \nmost second petitions filed during the appeal of the \ninitial habeas petition. Ochoa, 485 F.3d at 540. Indeed, \nthe Tenth Circuit stated that the minority rule \u201cwould \ngreatly undermine the policy against piecemeal \nlitigation embodied in \u00a7 2244(b).\u201d Id. \n\n \n16 \n \n \nNevertheless, there is a mature circuit split on \nwhether \u00a7 2244(b) applies to post-judgment motions \nfiled when the initial habeas application is pending on \nappeal. Moreover, this is a jurisdictional question, and \nthis Court has repeatedly described the importance of \nclear jurisdictional rules. See, e.g., Lapides v. Bd. of \nRegents of Univ. Sys. Of Georgia, 535 U.S. 613, 621 \n(2002). Thus, this could be a sufficient basis to justify \ncertiorari, even if only to affirm the majority rule. \n \n \nOn the other hand, the circuits are not \u201cintractably\u201d \nsplit as Rivers claims, nor is it certain that \u201cthe conflict \nwon\u2019t disappear on its own.\u201d See Pet. Cert. 2. Even \nlooking at Rivers\u2019 assertions more favorably, all of the \ncourts that do or could take the minority view\u2014the \nSecond, Third, and Tenth Circuits\u2014lacked the \nguidance and historical examination of AEDPA from \nthis Court\u2019s intervening decision in Banister. See, e.g., \nWhab, 408 F.3d at 118 (decided fifteen years prior to \nBanister); Santarelli, 929 F.3d at 106 (decided one year \nprior); Douglas, 560 F.3d at 1196 (decided eleven years \nprior). Certiorari is unwarranted at this stage because \nthe minority circuits have yet to self-correct. This \nCould should grant certiorari only if they fail to do so \nat the next opportunity. \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nBased on the foregoing reasons, the petition for a \nwrit of certiorari should be denied. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n17 \n \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \nKEN PAXTON \n \nAttorney General of Texas \n \n \n \nBRENT WEBSTER \n \nFirst Assistant Attorney \n \nGeneral \n \n \n \nJOSH RENO \n \nDeputy Attorney General for \n \nCriminal Justice \n \n \n \nEDWARD L.

Evaluating the final output is crucial for assessing the overall effectiveness of the agent's strategy (D). Seeing the final, synthesized prediction allows for a holistic review of the entire process from information gathering to reasoning. However, the action itself is not exploratory; it doesn't test a new strategy but rather culminates the current one.
