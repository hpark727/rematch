    "facts_of_the_case": "This case involves victims and family members of HAMAS terrorist attacks who sued BLOM Bank SAL for allegedly aiding HAMAS by providing financial services to customers affiliated with the terrorist organization. The plaintiffs brought their case under the Anti-Terrorism Act, as amended by the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA), claiming BLOM Bank was liable for aiding and abetting terrorism through these financial services.\n\nThe plaintiffs filed their initial complaint in January 2019, which the district court dismissed for failure to state a claim. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal but clarified that the district court had applied the wrong legal standard for aiding-and-abetting liability under JASTA. The plaintiffs then returned to the district court and moved to vacate the dismissal and amend their complaint. The district court denied their motion, and the Second Circuit concluded that the district court had erred by not properly balancing the competing principles of judgment finality (Rule 60(b)) and liberal pleading standards (Rule 15(a)).",

My current knowledge is limited to a high-level summary of the legal question. Accessing this brief is essential to move from a general understanding to a detailed analysis of one side's case, which is a critical step in forming a prediction.\n\nDesign EIG is moderately high (0.6) because this action represents a core, repeatable step in any SCOTUS case analysis: 'read the primary briefs'. Confirming the high utility of this step reinforces a fundamental principle of the prediction strategy, helping to solidify the optimal sequence of actions (i.e., party briefs are more critical to read early than, for example, amicus briefs or lower court opinions). It's not a novel strategy, but confirming its value is important for a robust design.\n\nJoint EIG is therefore very high, as this action is crucial for the specific task and also provides significant reinforcement for the general predictive methodology.",

In this case, Respondents \ndeclined multiple invitations and opportunities to \namend their complaint.  The District Court then \ndismissed their complaint with prejudice, and the \nSecond Circuit affirmed.  Only then did Respondents \nask the District Court to vacate the judgment so they \ncould file an amended complaint that would include \npreviously available facts.  The District Court denied \nthe \nmotion \nunder \nRule \n60(b)(6)\u2019s \nwell-settled \nstandard.  But the Second Circuit reversed, based on \nan anomalous \u201cbalanc[ing]\u201d test that requires district \ncourts to heed Rule 15(a)\u2019s \u201cliberal pleading principles\u201d \nwhen addressing a Rule 60(b)(6) motion to reopen a \nfinal judgment for the purpose of filing an amended \ncomplaint. \nThe question presented is: \nWhether Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent standard applies \nto a post-judgment request to vacate for the purpose of \nfiling an amended complaint. \n \n\nii \n \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nPetitioner BLOM Bank SAL was defendant in the \nUnited States District Court for the Eastern District \nof New York and appellee in the United States Court \nof Appeals for the Second Circuit.  \nRespondents Michal Honickman, Individually and \nfor the Estate of Howard Goldstein, Eugene \nGoldstein, Lorraine Goldstein, Richard Goldstein, \nBarbara Goldstein Ingardia, Michael Goldstein, \nChana Freedman, David Goldstein, Moses Strauss, \nPhilip Strauss, Bluma Strauss, Ahron Strauss, Roisie \nEngelman, Joseph Strauss, Tzvi Weiss, Leib Weiss, \nIndividually and for the Estate of Malka Weiss, \nYitzchak Weiss, Yeruchaim Weiss, Esther Deutsch, \nMatanya Nathansen, Individually and for the Estate \nof Tehilla Nathansen, Chana Nathansen, Individually \nand for the Estate of Tehilla Nathansen, Yehudit \nNathansen, S.N., a minor, Hezekial Toporowitch, \nPearl B.

As those precedents make clear, obtaining \nrelief from a final judgment under Rule 60(b)(6) \n\u201crequires a showing of \u2018extraordinary circumstances.\u2019\u201d  \nGonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524, 536 (2005).  And \nthose circumstances must demonstrate \u201cthat the \n[moving] party is faultless.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. \nBrunswick Assocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship, 507 U.S. 380, 393 \n(1993).  After all, \u201c[t]here must be an end to litigation \nsomeday, and free, calculated, deliberate choices are \nnot to be relieved from.\u201d  Ackermann v. United States, \n340 U.S. 193, 198 (1950). \nIt could hardly be otherwise.  Our adversarial \nsystem of civil justice could not function without a \nscrupulous regard for the conclusiveness of judgments \nprofessing to settle the parties\u2019 rights.  Courts have \nrecognized that fundamental precept since the \nFounding.  Consistent with that history and tradition, \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure afford district \ncourts the power to revisit a final judgment through \nRule 60(b) only in \u201ca limited set of circumstances.\u201d  \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. at 528.  And they strictly prohibit \na party from moving for such relief more than a year \nafter judgment if that party is even \u201cpartly to blame \nfor the delay.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs., 507 U.S. at 393; see \nFed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1), (c)(1).  \nFor decades, lower courts have faithfully applied \nthese well-settled principles of judgment finality.  And \nthey have uniformly rejected attempts by plaintiffs to \navoid Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent requirements by \n\n2 \n \nappealing to Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policy.  \nIndeed, the two inquiries are entirely separate.  Rule \n15(a) applies before trial and judgment, while Rule 60 \napplies after a final judgment.  Accordingly, \u201cif a \nplaintiff seeks to reopen a case under Rule 60(b) in \norder to file an amended complaint, she must satisfy \none of the Rule 60(b) grounds\u201d and have the judgment \nset aside \u201cbefore a court may consider her motion to \namend.\u201d  Daulatzai v. Maryland, 97 F.4th 166, 178 \n(4th Cir. 2024).  As the Fourth Circuit aptly put it \nearlier this year, adopting a contrary rule would have \nplaced it \u201calone in the Nation in collapsing the Rule \n60(b) standard with the standard for Rule 15(a).\u201d  Id. \nat 177. \nBut the decision below did just that\u2014in a case \nwhere Respondents repeatedly declined to amend \ntheir complaint in the normal course.  By rejecting the \nDistrict Court\u2019s multiple invitations to amend their \ncomplaint, Respondents deliberately chose to proceed \non that complaint as pled and take their chances on a \nmotion to dismiss.  The District Court eventually \ndismissed the complaint with prejudice, and the \nSecond Circuit affirmed the dismissal after full merits \nbriefing, oral argument, and supplemental briefing.  \nAt no time during those proceedings did Respondents \nseek leave to amend.   \nThen, more than 18 months after the dismissal \nwith prejudice\u2014and after that dismissal was affirmed \non appeal\u2014Respondents filed a Rule 60(b)(6) motion \nto vacate the judgment so they could restart the \nprocess and try again with an amended complaint.  \nThe District Court rejected that effort by properly \napplying Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent standard.  It \n\n3 \n \nemphasized that Respondents had \u201cnot demonstrated \nany extraordinary circumstances\u201d and had engaged in \na \u201cseries of deliberate choices not to cure the \ndeficiencies identified in their pleading by [Petitioner] \nand th[e] Court.\u201d  Pet.App.14, 19.  The District Court \ntherefore permissibly exercised its discretion to deny \nRespondents\u2019 motion. \nThe \nSecond \nCircuit \nnevertheless \nreversed.  \nApplying an atextual balancing test adopted by a split \npanel in Mandala v. NTT Data, Inc., 88 F.4th 353 (2d \nCir. 2023), the Second Circuit held that the District \nCourt abused its discretion by failing to \u201cgive \u2018due \nregard\u2019 to \u2018both the philosophy favoring finality of \njudgments . . . and the liberal amendment policy of \nRule 15(a).\u2019\u201d  Pet.App.7 (alteration in original) \n(quoting Mandala, 88 F.4th at 361).  In the Second \nCircuit\u2019s view, district courts are \u201crequired to consider \nRule 60(b) finality and Rule 15(a) liberality in tandem\u201d \nwhen plaintiffs seek to reopen a judgment in order to \nfile an amended complaint.  Id.  It thus faulted the \nDistrict Court for analyzing Respondents\u2019 Rule 60(b) \nmotion \u201cunder only Rule 60(b)\u2019s standard.\u201d  Id.   \nThat reasoning is indefensible.  The Second \nCircuit\u2019s outlier balancing test effectively rewrites the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.  It destroys the \nfinality principles embodied in Rule 60(b).  It \nencourages wasteful and pernicious litigation tactics.  \nIt imbues uncertainty.  And it contravenes this Court\u2019s \nprecedents at every turn.  This Court should reverse. \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe District Court\u2019s opinion dismissing the case \nwith prejudice on January 14, 2020 is reported at 432 \nF.

Only then did Respondents \nask the District Court to vacate the judgment so they \ncould file an amended complaint that would include \npreviously available facts.  The District Court denied \nthe \nmotion \nunder \nRule \n60(b)(6)\u2019s \nwell-settled \nstandard.  But the Second Circuit reversed, based on \nan anomalous \u201cbalanc[ing]\u201d test that requires district \ncourts to heed Rule 15(a)\u2019s \u201cliberal pleading principles\u201d \nwhen addressing a Rule 60(b)(6) motion to reopen a \nfinal judgment for the purpose of filing an amended \ncomplaint. \nThe question presented is: \nWhether Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent standard applies \nto a post-judgment request to vacate for the purpose of \nfiling an amended complaint. \n \n\nii \n \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nPetitioner BLOM Bank SAL was defendant in the \nUnited States District Court for the Eastern District \nof New York and appellee in the United States Court \nof Appeals for the Second Circuit.  \nRespondents Michal Honickman, Individually and \nfor the Estate of Howard Goldstein, Eugene \nGoldstein, Lorraine Goldstein, Richard Goldstein, \nBarbara Goldstein Ingardia, Michael Goldstein, \nChana Freedman, David Goldstein, Moses Strauss, \nPhilip Strauss, Bluma Strauss, Ahron Strauss, Roisie \nEngelman, Joseph Strauss, Tzvi Weiss, Leib Weiss, \nIndividually and for the Estate of Malka Weiss, \nYitzchak Weiss, Yeruchaim Weiss, Esther Deutsch, \nMatanya Nathansen, Individually and for the Estate \nof Tehilla Nathansen, Chana Nathansen, Individually \nand for the Estate of Tehilla Nathansen, Yehudit \nNathansen, S.N., a minor, Hezekial Toporowitch, \nPearl B.

As those precedents make clear, obtaining \nrelief from a final judgment under Rule 60(b)(6) \n\u201crequires a showing of \u2018extraordinary circumstances.\u2019\u201d  \nGonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524, 536 (2005).  And \nthose circumstances must demonstrate \u201cthat the \n[moving] party is faultless.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. \nBrunswick Assocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship, 507 U.S. 380, 393 \n(1993).  After all, \u201c[t]here must be an end to litigation \nsomeday, and free, calculated, deliberate choices are \nnot to be relieved from.\u201d  Ackermann v. United States, \n340 U.S. 193, 198 (1950). \nIt could hardly be otherwise.  Our adversarial \nsystem of civil justice could not function without a \nscrupulous regard for the conclusiveness of judgments \nprofessing to settle the parties\u2019 rights.  Courts have \nrecognized that fundamental precept since the \nFounding.  Consistent with that history and tradition, \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure afford district \ncourts the power to revisit a final judgment through \nRule 60(b) only in \u201ca limited set of circumstances.\u201d  \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. at 528.  And they strictly prohibit \na party from moving for such relief more than a year \nafter judgment if that party is even \u201cpartly to blame \nfor the delay.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs., 507 U.S. at 393; see \nFed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1), (c)(1).  \nFor decades, lower courts have faithfully applied \nthese well-settled principles of judgment finality.  And \nthey have uniformly rejected attempts by plaintiffs to \navoid Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent requirements by \n\n2 \n \nappealing to Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policy.  \nIndeed, the two inquiries are entirely separate.  Rule \n15(a) applies before trial and judgment, while Rule 60 \napplies after a final judgment.  Accordingly, \u201cif a \nplaintiff seeks to reopen a case under Rule 60(b) in \norder to file an amended complaint, she must satisfy \none of the Rule 60(b) grounds\u201d and have the judgment \nset aside \u201cbefore a court may consider her motion to \namend.\u201d  Daulatzai v. Maryland, 97 F.4th 166, 178 \n(4th Cir. 2024).  As the Fourth Circuit aptly put it \nearlier this year, adopting a contrary rule would have \nplaced it \u201calone in the Nation in collapsing the Rule \n60(b) standard with the standard for Rule 15(a).\u201d  Id. \nat 177. \nBut the decision below did just that\u2014in a case \nwhere Respondents repeatedly declined to amend \ntheir complaint in the normal course.  By rejecting the \nDistrict Court\u2019s multiple invitations to amend their \ncomplaint, Respondents deliberately chose to proceed \non that complaint as pled and take their chances on a \nmotion to dismiss.  The District Court eventually \ndismissed the complaint with prejudice, and the \nSecond Circuit affirmed the dismissal after full merits \nbriefing, oral argument, and supplemental briefing.  \nAt no time during those proceedings did Respondents \nseek leave to amend.   \nThen, more than 18 months after the dismissal \nwith prejudice\u2014and after that dismissal was affirmed \non appeal\u2014Respondents filed a Rule 60(b)(6) motion \nto vacate the judgment so they could restart the \nprocess and try again with an amended complaint.  \nThe District Court rejected that effort by properly \napplying Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent standard.  It \n\n3 \n \nemphasized that Respondents had \u201cnot demonstrated \nany extraordinary circumstances\u201d and had engaged in \na \u201cseries of deliberate choices not to cure the \ndeficiencies identified in their pleading by [Petitioner] \nand th[e] Court.\u201d  Pet.App.14, 19.  The District Court \ntherefore permissibly exercised its discretion to deny \nRespondents\u2019 motion. \nThe \nSecond \nCircuit \nnevertheless \nreversed.  \nApplying an atextual balancing test adopted by a split \npanel in Mandala v. NTT Data, Inc., 88 F.4th 353 (2d \nCir. 2023), the Second Circuit held that the District \nCourt abused its discretion by failing to \u201cgive \u2018due \nregard\u2019 to \u2018both the philosophy favoring finality of \njudgments . . . and the liberal amendment policy of \nRule 15(a).\u2019\u201d  Pet.App.7 (alteration in original) \n(quoting Mandala, 88 F.4th at 361).  In the Second \nCircuit\u2019s view, district courts are \u201crequired to consider \nRule 60(b) finality and Rule 15(a) liberality in tandem\u201d \nwhen plaintiffs seek to reopen a judgment in order to \nfile an amended complaint.  Id.  It thus faulted the \nDistrict Court for analyzing Respondents\u2019 Rule 60(b) \nmotion \u201cunder only Rule 60(b)\u2019s standard.\u201d  Id.   \nThat reasoning is indefensible.  The Second \nCircuit\u2019s outlier balancing test effectively rewrites the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.  It destroys the \nfinality principles embodied in Rule 60(b).  It \nencourages wasteful and pernicious litigation tactics.  \nIt imbues uncertainty.  And it contravenes this Court\u2019s \nprecedents at every turn.  This Court should reverse. \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe District Court\u2019s opinion dismissing the case \nwith prejudice on January 14, 2020 is reported at 432 \nF.

The petition for writ of certiorari was timely \nfiled on May 29, 2024, and granted on October 4, 2024.  \nThis Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nFEDERAL RULES INVOLVED \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) governs \nmotions for \u201cRelief from a Final Judgment.\u201d  It \nprovides five specific grounds for relief.  See Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 60(b)(1)-(5).  Rule 60(b)(6) then states that \u201cthe \ncourt may relieve a party or its legal representative \nfrom a final judgment, order, or proceeding for . . . any \nother reason that justifies relief.\u201d \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a) governs \n\u201cAmendments Before Trial.\u201d  Rule 15(a)(2) provides \nthat \u201ca party may amend its pleading only with the \nopposing party\u2019s written consent or the court\u2019s leave.  \nThe court should freely give leave when justice so \nrequires.\u201d \n\n5 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. The Initial District Court Proceedings \nRespondents filed this lawsuit on January 1, 2019, \na day before the statute of limitations expired and \nnearly sixteen years after the latest of the events in \nquestion.  JA.1; see Pub. L. No. 112-239, \u00a7 1251(c), 126 \nStat. 1632, 2017-18 (2013) (extending the ordinary \nlimitations period for certain Anti-Terrorism Act \nclaims to January 2, 2019).  Respondents are victims \nand the families of victims of terrorist attacks carried \nout by Hamas between December 1, 2001, and August \n19, 2003.  JA.7-81.  As Petitioner explained in the \nproceedings below, it categorically abhors terrorism, it \nhas no connection to Hamas, and it is not legally or \nfactually \nresponsible \nfor \nRespondents\u2019 \ninjuries.  \nJA.160-62, 168-72.1   \nThe complaint accuses Petitioner of aiding and \nabetting those attacks through a daisy chain of \nspeculation.  In particular, Respondents allege that \n \n1  Respondents have filed almost a dozen more lawsuits \nagainst other defendants in the nearly sixteen years following the \nattacks, all seeking damages for the same injuries alleged here.  \nSee Kirschenbaum v. Islamic Repub. of Iran, No. 1:03-cv-01708-\nRCL (D.D.C.); Sokolow v. Palestine Liberation Org., No. 1:04-cv-\n00397-GBD-RLE (S.D.N.Y); Linde v. Arab Bank, PLC, No. 1:04-\ncv-02799-BMC-PK (E.D.N.Y.); Wolf v. Credit Lyonnais, S.A., No. \n07-cv-00914 (E.D.N.Y.); Applebaum v. Nat\u2019l Westminster Bank, \nPLC, No. 1:07-cv-00916-DLI-RML (E.D.N.Y.); Beer v. ASSA \nCorp., No. 1:13-cv-01848-LAP (S.D.N.Y.); Singer v. Bank of \nPalestine, No. 1:19-cv-00006-ENV-RML (E.D.N.Y.); Averbach v. \nCairo Amman Bank, No. 1:19-cv-00004-GHW-KHP (S.D.N.Y.); \nMiller v.

Bank, No. 1:19-cv-\n00005-EK-JAM (E.D.N.Y.). \n\n6 \n \nPetitioner provided routine financial services to three \ncustomers:  Sanabil, Subul al-Khair, and Union of \nGood (together, the \u201cThree Customers\u201d).  JA.106, 116, \n120.  Though the Complaint spans 645 paragraphs, it \nsays relatively little about the Three Customers (or \nPetitioner).  See generally JA.1-122.  In fact, none of \nthe Three Customers was itself alleged to have \nengaged in acts of terrorism.  Instead, \u201cthe Three \nCustomers were alleged only to have supported \norphans in Palestinian refugee camps.\u201d  Pet.App.52 \nn.21.   \nRespondents pled their claim under the Anti-\nTerrorism Act (\u201cATA\u201d), as amended by the Justice \nAgainst Sponsors of Terrorism Act (\u201cJASTA\u201d).  JA.121-\n22.  Under the ATA, a United States national \u201cinjured \nin his or her person, property, or business by reason of \nan act of international terrorism, or his or her estate, \nsurvivors, or heirs, may sue therefor in any \nappropriate district court of the United States.\u201d  18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2333(a).  JASTA provides for secondary \nliability against \u201cany person who aids and abets, by \nknowingly providing substantial assistance, or who \nconspires with the person who committed such an act \nof international terrorism.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 2333(d)(2).   \nTo impose secondary liability, JASTA requires \u201cthat \nthe defendant consciously and culpably \u2018participated\u2019 \nin a wrongful act so as to help \u2018make it succeed.\u2019\u201d  \nTwitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, 598 U.S. 471, 493 (2023) \n(alteration adopted) (quoting Nye & Nissen v. United \nStates, 326 U.S. 613, 619 (1949)).  And \u201cJASTA further \nrestricts secondary liability by requiring that the \u2018act \nof international terrorism\u2019 be \u2018committed, planned, or \nauthorized by\u2019 a foreign terrorist organization \n\n7 \n \ndesignated as such \u2018as of the date on which such act of \ninternational terrorism was committed, planned, or \nauthorized.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 495 (quoting 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2333(d)(2)).  Thus, \u201cit is not enough\u201d that a \ndefendant has \u201cgiven substantial assistance to a \ntranscendent \u2018enterprise\u2019 separate from and floating \nabove all the actionable wrongs that constitute it.\u201d  Id.  \n\u201cRather, a defendant must have aided and abetted (by \nknowingly providing substantial assistance) another \nperson in the commission of the actionable wrong\u2014\nhere, an act of international terrorism.\u201d  Id.  \nUnder JASTA, one of the three elements for aiding-\nand-abetting liability is that \u201cthe defendant must be \ngenerally aware of his role as part of an overall illegal \nor tortious activity at the time that he provides the \nassistance.\u201d  Id. at 486 (emphasis added) (quoting \nHalberstam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472, 477 (D.C. Cir. \n1983)).  Accordingly, to state a claim, Respondents \nneeded to plausibly allege that Petitioner was aware \nof a link between the Three Customers and Hamas \u201cat \nthe time\u201d Petitioner allegedly provided services to \nthem.  Id. (citation omitted).  But they failed to do so, \neven though their complaint was filed more than \nfifteen years after the latest of the attacks.  \nPetitioner made this point clearly and repeatedly \nthroughout the proceedings below.  Before moving to \ndismiss, Petitioner submitted a three-page letter \nsummarizing the grounds for its contemplated motion, \nas required by the District Court\u2019s Individual \nPractices.  JA.142-47.  Petitioner\u2019s lead argument was \nthat the complaint did not plausibly allege the general \nawareness element necessary to state their JASTA \n\n8 \n \nclaim.  JA.144.2  This argument, in turn, relied on the \ncomplaint\u2019s failure to allege that Petitioner was aware \nof any connection between the Three Customers and \nHamas before the attacks\u2014that is, by August 19, \n2003.  JA.145.  The complaint acknowledged that the \nThree Customers \u201cengaged in actual charitable work.\u201d  \nJA.143.  They were only \u201clater linked to Hamas.\u201d  Id.   \nIn response to this letter, Respondents chose not to \namend.  See JA.148-55.  They instead stood on the \nallegations in their complaint.  See id. \nAt a pre-motion conference, the District Court \nasked Respondents\u2019 counsel: \u201cAre there any additional \nfacts you could add to the allegations that the \ndefendant is challenging here or are you comfortable \nstanding on your complaint as it is?\u201d  Pet.App.93 \n(emphasis added).  Respondents\u2019 counsel declined the \nCourt\u2019s invitation: \u201cNo, I think we are prepared to \nbrief it based on the arguments presented in the pre-\nmotion letter.\u201d  Id.  The Court then asked whether \nRespondents would seek leave to amend if the Court \ngranted \nPetitioner\u2019s \nmotion \nto \ndismiss. \n \nId.  \nRespondents\u2019 counsel unequivocally stated that they \n\u201cwould not seek leave to amend.\u201d  Pet.App.94. \nAfter the conference, the District Court issued an \norder memorializing the fact that the court \u201coffered \n[Respondents] \nan \nopportunity \nto \namend \ntheir \n \n2  Petitioner also argued that Respondents failed to plausibly \nallege the knowing provision of substantial assistance to the \nalleged terrorist activities or any facts suggesting that \nPetitioner\u2019s routine banking services directly assisted the acts \nthat caused Respondents\u2019 injuries.  JA.145-47; see also Twitter, \n598 U.S. at 506 (summarizing principles of aiding-and-abetting \nliability under JASTA). \n\n9 \n \ncomplaint\u201d to \u201cadd additional information in response \nto the arguments raised by [Petitioner],\u201d but they \n\u201cdeclined to do so and represented that they would not \nbe seeking to amend their Complaint in this regard.\u201d  \nJA.156.  Respondents stuck to that position, and they \ndid not seek leave to amend their complaint. \nA few weeks later, Petitioner moved to dismiss \nconsistent with its pre-motion letter.  JA.159.  Among \nother arguments, it reiterated that the complaint \nfailed to plausibly allege that Petitioner knew of the \nThree Customers\u2019 purported affiliation with Hamas \nbefore the alleged attacks.  JA.160-61, 174-85.  \nRespondents opposed that motion and, in doing so, \nonce again stood on their papers.  JA.197-241.  They \ndid not move to amend or ask for an opportunity to \nreplead \nshould \nthe \nDistrict \nCourt \nfind \ntheir \nallegations lacking. \nThe District Court then held oral argument.  \nPet.App.100.  There, Petitioner\u2019s counsel again \nemphasized the complaint\u2019s failure to connect the \nThree Customers to Hamas \u201cat the time of any of the \nattacks.\u201d  Pet.App.109.  \u201cAt the very most, what the \ncomplaint alleges is that BLOM provided financial \nservices to three entities, two of which were later \ndetermined by the [U.S.] government to have provided \nfinancial support to [Hamas].\u201d  Pet.App.108 (emphasis \nadded). \nThe District Court pressed Respondents\u2019 counsel \non this pleading deficiency, asking \u201c[w]here do you \nallege in your complaint that BLOM Bank knew that \nthese account holders are alter egos or are a part of, or \nthe same as [Hamas]?\u201d  Pet.App.121.  The District \nCourt then offered Respondents\u2019 counsel yet another \n\n10 \n \nopportunity to amend the complaint, specifically with \nrespect to Petitioner\u2019s alleged \u201cknowledge\u201d: \nThe Court: I do recall that you did not want an \nopportunity to try to replead . . . . And I think \nthe Second Circuit may not encourage district \ncourts to allow another round of pleading if \nthere\u2019s been a declination of an opportunity to \nreplead . . . . So everything I need to consider in \nterms of sufficiency of your pleading is going to \nbe found in the complaint that\u2019s filed in this \ncase, correct? \nMr. Radine: Yes, Your Honor.  The\u2014 \nThe Court: There are no facts that you would \nhave to offer to address some of the contentions \nof \nthe \ndefendants \nregarding \nknowledge, \nespecially? \nMr. Radine: I think we could always add \nallegations, but the\u2014we believe the complaint \ngoes far enough in saying that BLOM . . . was \ngenerally aware of its role in th[e] [il]licit \nconduct . . . . \nPet.App.124-25 (emphasis added). \nThe District Court granted Petitioner\u2019s motion to \ndismiss, holding in relevant part that Respondents \nhad not \u201cplausibly allege[d] that [Petitioner] was \ngenerally aware of any connection between the Three \nCustomers and Hamas\u201d \u201cat the time it provided \nfinancial \nservices \nto \nthe \nThree \nCustomers.\u201d  \nPet.App.73-75.   \nThe court noted that it \u201ctypically grants plaintiffs \nan opportunity to amend their complaints following \ndismissal, to address any deficiencies raised by the \n\n11 \n \nCourt\u2019s order.\u201d  Pet.App.85.  However, Respondents \nhere \u201c[did] not request leave to amend, and specifically \ndeclined the Court\u2019s offer to do so.\u201d  Id.  Accordingly, \n\u201c[i]n \nlight \nof \n[Respondents\u2019] \nrejection \nof \nthe \nopportunity to amend their pleading at the pre-motion \nconference, and the fact that they ha[d] not identified \nany additional facts they could allege which would \naddress the deficiencies in their complaint,\u201d the \nDistrict Court dismissed the complaint with prejudice.  \nPet.App.86.   \nB. Respondents\u2019 Initial Appeal to the Second \nCircuit \nRather than request leave to amend or file a Rule \n59(e) \nmotion \nfor \nreconsideration, \nRespondents \nappealed.  In that appeal, they did not challenge the \nDistrict Court\u2019s decision to dismiss without leave to \namend.  Pet.App.16 n.4.  They instead doubled down \non their argument that their existing allegations were \nenough to \u201cstate a claim to relief that is plausible on \nits face.\u201d  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) \n(citation omitted).   \nAfter oral argument, the Second Circuit held the \nappeal in abeyance pending its decision in Kaplan v. \nLebanese Canadian Bank, SAL, 999 F.3d 842 (2d Cir. \n2021).  It also ordered the parties to submit \nsupplemental briefs addressing the significance of \nthat decision.  JA.257-58.  At this point, Respondents \nhad yet another opportunity to ask the appellate court \nto remand or grant them leave to amend in light of the \nKaplan decision.  Once again, though, they did \nneither.  They instead relied on their complaint as pled \nand insisted that the allegations therein stated a \nclaim.  JA.259-81.   \n\n12 \n \nThe Second Circuit affirmed the District Court\u2019s \ndismissal because the complaint\u2019s \u201callegations [did] \nnot support an inference that [Petitioner] was aware \nof the Three Customers\u2019 ties with Hamas prior to the \nrelevant attacks.\u201d  Pet.App.49.  Respondents did not \nseek rehearing.  Nor did they belatedly request that \nthe Second Circuit modify its decision to remand and \npermit Respondents leave to amend the complaint. \nC. The Post-Judgment Proceedings \nRespondents instead returned to the District Court \nand moved to vacate the District Court\u2019s now-affirmed \njudgment under Rule 60(b)(6) so they could amend \ntheir complaint and return to square one.  JA.315-22.  \nThe District Court held a pre-motion conference, at \nwhich it ordered briefing \u201conly as to the issue of \nvacatur.\u201d  JA.509.   \nAfter briefing, the District Court held that \n\u201c[Respondents] \nhave \nnot \ndemonstrated \nany \nextraordinary circumstances warranting relief under \nRule 60(b)(6).\u201d  Pet.App.14.  It also explained that \nRespondents had not demonstrated that they would \nsuffer an \u201cextreme and undue hardship\u201d from letting \nthe judgment stand because they \u201chave had ample \nopportunity to pursue all legal avenues available to \nthem for relief.\u201d  Pet.App.15-16 (quotation marks \nomitted).  \u201cFundamentally, [Respondents] seek to \namend their complaint after declining two prior \nopportunities to do so, and after unsuccessfully \nappealing the dismissal of that complaint with \nprejudice.\u201d  Pet.App.16.  And they sought to start the \nprocess all over again on the sole basis that they \nwished to plead new facts that were previously \navailable.  Pet.App.15.  The District Court thus \n\n13 \n \ndecided, in its discretion, to leave the final judgment \nin place given Respondents\u2019 \u201cdocumented series of \ndeliberate choices not to cure the deficiencies \nidentified in their pleading by [Petitioner] and [the \nDistrict] Court.\u201d  Pet.App.19.  \nRespondents appealed again.  Petitioner defended \nthe District Court\u2019s ruling by arguing that Rule \n60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent standards governed Respondents\u2019 \nmotion, that Rule 15(a) had no role to play in that \nanalysis, and that Respondents fell far short of \ndemonstrating \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d given \ntheir many earlier refusals to seek leave to amend.  \nSee 2d Cir. Dkt. No. 42, at 37-49, 55-59.  After oral \nargument, the Second Circuit issued its decision in \nMandala, 88 F.4th 353.   \nIn Mandala, a split panel held that, when a losing \nparty seeks post-judgment relief under Rule 60(b)(6) \nto amend its complaint, a district court must balance \nRule 60(b)(6)\u2019s finality principles with Rule 15(a)(2)\u2019s \n\u201cliberal amendment policy.\u201d  Id. at 361 (quoting \nWilliams v. Citigroup Inc., 659 F.3d 208, 213 (2d Cir. \n2011) (per curiam)).  And, where a losing party has not \nyet filed an amended complaint, the Second Circuit \nheld that it is an abuse of discretion for a district court \nto deny a Rule 60(b)(6) motion based solely on the \nmovant\u2019s \u201cfailure to demonstrate adequate grounds for \nrelief under Rule 60.\u201d  Id. at 362 & n.5.  In doing so, \nthe court flipped the burden from Rule 60 movants \n(who \nnormally \nmust \nprove \nextraordinary \ncircumstances) to their opponent (to show that the \nmovant should not receive another bite at the apple).  \nAs Judge Sullivan explained in dissent, that defies \n\u201cthe principle that Rule 60(b)(6) affords litigants an \n\n14 \n \nextraordinary remedy and effectively holds that such \nrelief is available in the ordinary course.\u201d  Id. at 368 \n(Sullivan, J., dissenting).  Judge Sullivan also \nexplained that the Second Circuit\u2019s approach \u201cerode[s] \nthe finality of judgments,\u201d \u201csignificantly undermine[s] \nthe important purposes served by Rule 60(b),\u201d and \n\u201cincrease[s] the workload of busy district court judges \nwho carry the heaviest burden in our system of civil \njustice.\u201d  Id. at 369. \nThe Second Circuit then applied and reaffirmed \nMandala\u2019s balancing test in the decision below.  It held \nthat \u201cthe district court exceeded its discretion by \nbasing its ruling on an erroneous view of the law \nbecause it failed to balance Rule 60(b)\u2019s finality \nprinciples \nand \nRule \n15(a)\u2019s \nliberal \npleading \nprinciples.\u201d  Pet.App.7-8.  When presented with a \nmotion to vacate for the purposes of amendment, the \nSecond Circuit said, \u201cthe district court is required to \nconsider Rule 60(b) finality and Rule 15(a) liberality \nin tandem.\u201d  Pet.App.7.  Thus, the Second Circuit held \nthat the District Court abused its discretion because it \nanalyzed the Rule 60(b) motion here \u201cunder only Rule \n60(b)\u2019s standard.\u201d  Id. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s outlier approach contradicts \nthe text, structure, and history of the Federal Rules, \nand it violates decades of this Court\u2019s precedents.  It \njettisons Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s well-settled and exacting \n\u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d \nstandard \nfor \na \nnebulous balancing test that wrongly smuggles Rule \n15(a)\u2019s \u201cliberal pleading principles\u201d into the calculus \nfor vacating a final judgment.  The decision below \nshould therefore be reversed, and the District Court\u2019s \n\n15 \n \ndenial of Respondents\u2019 Rule 60(b)(6) motion should be \nreinstated so this case can finally come to an end. \nI.  A party seeking to set aside an affirmed \njudgment for the purpose of filing an amended \ncomplaint must first satisfy Rule 60(b)\u2019s stringent \nstandards for vacating the judgment.  That common-\nsense position has been adopted by every other Court \nof Appeals.  And the Second Circuit\u2019s contrary \nbalancing approach is fundamentally mistaken. \nA.  Rule 60(b) imposes an intentionally high hurdle \nfor relief\u2014and understandably so.  This Court has \nlong underscored the profound importance of finality \nto our civil justice system.  After all, litigants, courts, \nand the public alike all share an interest in the \nconclusiveness of judgments and the peace and repose \nthat such finality brings.  Courts since the Founding \nhave thus consistently refused to reopen matters that \nhave been litigated to final judgment\u2014except in the \nmost compelling circumstances. \nRule 60(b) is rooted in that tradition.  It codified \nmany of the narrow, common-law exceptions for relief \nfrom a final judgment, along with a catchall in Rule \n60(b)(6) for similarly extraordinary circumstances \nthat are not explicitly covered by subsections \n(1) through (5).  Rule 60(b) therefore demands a \nscrupulous regard for finality.  Indeed, this Court has \nrepeatedly emphasized that Rule 60(b)(6) requires \n\u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d to justify vacating a \nfinal judgment.  See, e.g., Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 536. \nThat is the standard that applies here.  Rule 60(b) \nprovides the exclusive mechanism for \u201cRelief from a \nFinal Judgment\u201d more than 28 days after entry.  And \nRule 15(a) has no place in that inquiry.  Instead, Rule \n\n16 \n \n15(a) is limited to \u201cAmendments Before Trial.\u201d  There \nis not even a pending complaint to amend when an \naction has been finally dismissed with prejudice.  The \nsuit is over, and the claim is extinguished by the \ndoctrine of res judicata. \nAccordingly, plaintiffs cannot reopen a final \njudgment by invoking Rule 15(a)\u2019s policies without \nfirst meeting Rule 60(b)\u2019s restrictive standards.  And \nwhere, as here, plaintiffs seek relief under Rule \n60(b)(6), \nthey \nmust \nshow \n\u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d not covered by any other provision of \nRule 60(b).  To hold otherwise would enable plaintiffs \nto sidestep Rule 60(b)\u2019s deliberately narrow grounds \nfor post-judgment relief and thwart the Rule\u2019s respect \nfor finality. \nB.  Moreover, this Court has long held that a party \nmust be \u201cfaultless\u201d to obtain relief under Rule 60(b)(6).  \nPioneer Inv. Servs., 507 U.S. at 393; see Ackermann, \n340 U.S. at 197-202.  That is because Rule 60(b)(1) \nspecifically authorizes motions for relief premised on \n\u201cmistake, \ninadvertence, \nsurprise, \nor \nexcusable \nneglect,\u201d while strictly limiting the window for \nbringing such a motion to one year after judgment.  \nRule 60(b)(6) cannot be used to circumvent those \nlimitations.  If it could, then Rule 60(b)\u2019s provision for \n\u201cexcusable neglect\u201d would become superfluous. \nNor can Rule 60(b)(6) be used to circumvent basic \nprinciples of waiver.  That has been firmly settled by \nthis Court for decades.  See Ackermann, 340 U.S. at \n197-98.  Accordingly, where a plaintiff deliberately \nwaives the right to amend its complaint in the \nordinary course, it cannot seek a mulligan post-\n\n17 \n \njudgment after that considered choice has led to a \ndismissal with prejudice. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s outlier approach nullifies \nthese foundational principles.  Rather than requiring \nthe moving party to be faultless, the Second Circuit \nhas crafted a muddled balancing test that saves \nplaintiffs from their own litigation choices.  And the \ncourt has eschewed finality even where\u2014as here\u2014the \nmoving parties repeatedly and explicitly declined to \namend their complaint before judgment.  \nC.  The Second Circuit provided no persuasive \njustification for its balancing test.   \n1. It never even attempted to ground its analysis \nin the text of the Federal Rules.  In fact, as noted \nabove, its approach is at odds with the text and context \nof both Rule 15(a) and Rule 60(b). \n2. Moreover, by diluting Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s standard \nwith Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal repleading policy, the Second \nCircuit rendered Rule 60(b) internally inconsistent in \nat least three ways.  First, its balancing test enables \nplaintiffs to evade the one-year limitations period for \nRule 60(b) motions premised on \u201cexcusable neglect,\u201d \nby compelling district courts to reopen final judgments \noutside that timeframe based on previously omitted \nallegations.  Second, it thwarts the time limits for Rule \n60(b) motions premised on \u201cmistake\u201d of law or fact that \noccurred in the initial proceedings.  Third, it allows \nparties to reopen proceedings based on factual \nallegations they could have made pre-judgment\u2014even \nthough Rule 60(b)(2) specifically limits relief based on \nnew facts to those that could not have been previously \ndiscovered through due diligence.  \n\n18 \n \n3. The Second Circuit\u2019s test finds no support in \nprecedent either.  The decision below relied on Foman \nv. Davis, 371 U.S. 178 (1962).  But Foman is \ninapposite.  That case involved a Rule 59(e) motion, \nwhile this case concerns a Rule 60(b) motion.  There is \nno reason to conflate the standards for those two rules.  \nRules 59(e) and 60(b) differ in material ways and \nimpose different standards for relief by their own \nterms.  So this Court has refused to treat Rule 59(e) \nand Rule 60(b) motions as fungible.  See Banister v. \nDavis, 590 U.S. 504, 517-21 (2020). \n4. Finally, \neven \nif \nany \ninterpretive \ndoubt \nremained, this Court must \u201cconstrue[]\u201d the Rules to \n\u201csecure \nthe \njust, \nspeedy, \nand \ninexpensive \ndetermination of every action.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 1.  Far \nfrom advancing these overarching objectives, the \nSecond Circuit\u2019s test destroys them.  It allows the \nreopening of final judgments after plaintiffs have \nwillingly induced the judiciary to render a final \njudgment (and here an appellate ruling) based on their \noperative pleadings.  It thus invites a wasteful \nfeedback loop of relitigation.  As this case shows, that \napproach is neither just nor speedy nor inexpensive.   \nAt bottom, the Second Circuit erred in collapsing \nthe Rule 15(a) and Rule 60(b) inquiries.  The two rules \npose distinct hurdles.  The former applies before final \njudgment, and the latter applies after final judgment.  \nAs a result, Respondents could not seek leave to \namend unless they first proved \u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d beyond their control that would justify \nthe reopening of the final judgment dismissing their \ncase, which had already been affirmed on appeal. \n\n19 \n \nII. Respondents came nowhere close to meeting \nthat stringent standard\u2014and the District Court \ncertainly did not abuse its discretion in so finding. \nA.  There are no extraordinary circumstances here.  \nRespondents do not dispute that their late-breaking \nallegations were previously available to them.  They \nmerely argue that the Second Circuit \u201cclarified\u201d the \npleading standard for JASTA claims in their appeal.  \nBut the Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal with \nprejudice because\u2014as the District Court recognized\u2014\nRespondents failed to plausibly allege that Petitioner \nknew of the Three Customers\u2019 supposed connection to \nHamas at the time it allegedly provided routine \nbanking services to them.  And, in all events, mere \nclarification of the law is not extraordinary.  It is what \nappellate courts do day in and day out.  Indeed, this \nCourt has held that even an outright change in the law \ndoes not warrant relief under Rule 60(b)(6).  See \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. at 537.  The District Court thus did \nnot abuse its discretion in finding a lack of \nextraordinary circumstances. \nB.  On the contrary, the District Court would have \nnecessarily abused its discretion had it granted \nRespondents\u2019 motion.  This Court has made clear that \nit is an abuse of discretion to override a party\u2019s \ndeliberate waiver.  Here, Respondents waived or \nforfeited multiple opportunities to amend their \ncomplaint.  They first explicitly rejected the District \nCourt\u2019s invitation to amend at the pre-motion \nconference, after Petitioner had already pointed out \nthe \ndeficiencies \nin \nRespondents\u2019 \npleadings.  \nRespondents again rebuffed the District Court\u2019s \ninvitation to amend at oral argument.  They declined \n\n20 \n \nto file a Rule 59(e) motion to ask the District Court for \na chance to replead after they lost.  They chose not to \nappeal the \u201cwith prejudice\u201d component of the District \nCourt\u2019s dismissal.  And they never asked the Second \nCircuit for leave to replead if the court found their \nallegations lacking\u2014not in their opening brief, not in \ntheir reply brief, not at oral argument, and not in their \nsupplemental brief.   \nRespondents were thus far from faultless in the \ndelay.  Their own deliberate choices created the \ncircumstances from which they now seek relief.  Rule \n60(b)(6) does not save them from those strategic and \n\u201cvoluntary\u201d decisions.  Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 200.  \nGiven their repeated waivers of the chance to amend, \nRespondents could not even satisfy the more forgiving \nstandard for relief under Rule 59(e). \nFor all these reasons, this Court should reverse the \ndecision below and render judgment for Petitioner. \nARGUMENT \nI. A Party Seeking To Vacate A Final Judgment \nFor Purposes Of Amendment Must First \nSatisfy Rule 60(b). \nRelying on a series of Second Circuit precedents, \nthe decision below held that the District Court abused \nits discretion by \u201crequiring Plaintiffs to successfully \nnavigate Rule 60(b)\u2019s finality gauntlet before they \ncould invoke Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal repleading policy.\u201d  \nPet.App.8.  That, however, is precisely what the \nDistrict Court was obligated to do.  The Second \nCircuit\u2019s contrary position cannot be squared with \nRule 60(b)\u2019s text, its broader context, or this Court\u2019s \nprecedents.  It has thus been unanimously rejected by \n\n21 \n \nevery other Court of Appeals.3  That overwhelming \nmajority view is correct, and the Second Circuit\u2019s \noutlier balancing test is wrong. \nA. Rule 60(b)(6) Requires a Movant to Show \n\u201cExtraordinary Circumstances.\u201d \nThis Court has long extolled the importance of \nfinality to our system of justice.  Indeed, \u201cthe very \nobject for which civil courts have been established\u201d is \n\u201cto secure the peace and repose of society by the \nsettlement \nof \nmatters \ncapable \nof \njudicial \ndetermination.\u201d  Southern Pac. R.R. Co. v. United \nStates, 168 U.S. 1, 49 (1897).  \u201c[T]he aid of judicial \ntribunals would not be invoked\u201d if \u201cconclusiveness did \nnot attend the judgments of such tribunals.\u201d  Id.  For \nthat reason, courts since the Founding have \nrecognized that only \u201ca very strong case\u201d may justify \ndisturbing \u201cthe public interest and policy to make an \nend to litigation.\u201d  Ocean Ins.

Farrand ed., 1807). \nThat understanding persisted up through the \nadoption of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in \n1938.  By that time, a patchwork of methods had \ndeveloped for litigants seeking relief after a court\u2019s \nentry of final judgment and the expiration of the term.  \nSee Comment, Temporal Aspects of the Finality of \nJudgments\u2014The Significance of Federal Rule 60(b), \n17 U. Chi. L. Rev. 664, 664-65 (1950).  But courts \nalways remained \u201ccautious in exercising their power\u201d \nto reopen settled matters.  Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. \nHartford-Empire Co., 322 U.S. 238, 244 (1944).  Relief \ncontinued to be reserved only for \u201ccertain limited \nsituations.\u201d  James Wm. Moore & Elizabeth B. A. \nRogers, Federal Relief from Civil Judgments, 55 Yale \nL.J. 623, 627 (1946). \nRule 60(b) codifies many of these \u201cwell-recognized \nand concrete exceptions to the finality principle.\u201d  \nMary Kay Kane, Relief from Federal Judgments: A \nMorass Unrelieved by a Rule, 30 Hastings L.J. 41, 43 \n(1978); see Banister, 590 U.S. at 518.  These specific \nexceptions \ninclude \n(1) \u201cmistake, \ninadvertence, \nsurprise, or excusable neglect,\u201d (2) \u201cnewly discovered \nevidence,\u201d (3) \u201cfraud,\u201d (4) a \u201cvoid\u201d judgment, or \n(5) situations where \u201cthe judgment has been satisfied, \nreleased, or discharged; it is based on an earlier \njudgment that has been reversed or vacated; or \napplying it prospectively is no longer equitable.\u201d  Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 60(b)(1)-(5).  Rule 60(b) also includes a \n\n23 \n \ncatchall provision for \u201cany other reason that justifies \nrelief.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6). \nThat final subsection\u2019s berth has been tightly \ncircumscribed.  \u201cWhen faced with a catchall phrase \nlike [Rule 60(b)(6)], courts do not necessarily afford it \nthe broadest possible construction it can bear.\u201d  \nHarrington v. Purdue Pharma L.P., 144 S. Ct. 2071, \n2082 (2024).  That is because readers \u201cgenerally \nappreciate that the catchall must be interpreted in \nlight of its surrounding context and read to \u2018embrace \nonly objects similar in nature\u2019 to the specific examples \npreceding it.\u201d  Id. (quoting Epic Sys. Corp. v. Lewis, \n584 U.S. 497, 512 (2018)); accord Hall St. Assocs., \nL.L.C. v. Mattel, Inc., 552 U.S. 576, 586 (2008). \nConsistent with that \u201cancient interpretive principle\u201d \nof ejusdem generis, Harrington, 144 S. Ct. at 2082, this \nCourt has long construed Rule 60(b)(6) to authorize \nrelief from a final judgment only in similarly \n\u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d that are not otherwise \nspecifically covered by the Rule, Ackermann, 340 U.S. \nat 199.  The Court has emphasized that stringent \nrequirement time and again in an unbroken line of \ndecisions.  See Kemp v. United States, 596 U.S. 528, \n533 (2022); Tharpe v. Sellers, 583 U.S. 33, 35 (2018) \n(per curiam); Buck v. Davis, 580 U.S. 100, 123 (2017); \nChristeson v. Roper, 574 U.S. 373, 380 (2015) (per \ncuriam); Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 535; Agostini v. Felton, \n521 U.S. 203, 239 (1997); Pioneer Inv. Servs., 507 U.S. \nat 393; Liljeberg v. Health Servs. Acquisition Corp., \n486 U.S. 847, 863 n.11, 864 (1988); Ackermann, 340 \nU.S. at 199; Klapprott v. United States, 335 U.S. 601, \n613-14 (1949).   \n\n24 \n \n\u201cThis very strict interpretation of Rule 60(b) is \nessential if the finality of judgments is to be \npreserved.\u201d  Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 535 (quoting \nLiljeberg, \n486 \nU.S. \nat \n873 \n(Rehnquist, \nC.J., \ndissenting)).  And this Court has left no room for Rule \n15\u2019s liberal amendment policy to creep into the \nequation.  For good reason:  Rule 60(b) is carefully \ncrafted to provide a mechanism only for those rare \n\u201csituations in which relief must be obtained after \njudgment,\u201d and \u201cthe broad amendment policy of Rule \n15(a) should not be construed in a manner that would \nrender [that] provision[] meaningless.\u201d  6 Wright & \nMiller, Federal Practice & Procedure \u00a7 1489 (3d ed. \n2024).  \u201cTo hold otherwise would enable the liberal \namendment policy of Rule 15(a) to be employed in a \nway that is contrary to the philosophy favoring finality \nof judgments and the expeditious termination of \nlitigation\u201d that the Rules were designed to promote.  \nTool Box, Inc. v. Ogden City Corp., 419 F.3d 1084, 1087 \n(10th Cir. 2005) (quoting 6 Wright & Miller, Federal \nPractice & Procedure \u00a7 1489 (2d ed. 1990)); see Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 1. \nThis understanding is also consistent with Rule \n15(a)\u2019s text, history, and structure.  By its terms, Rule \n15(a) provides a liberal repleading policy only \u201cbefore \ntrial.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a) (capitalization altered).  Up \nuntil that point in the litigation, courts \u201cshould freely \ngive leave\u201d to amend a complaint \u201cwhen justice so \nrequires.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2).  This policy \nfacilitates having claims \u201cdecided on [their] merits \nrather than on procedural technicalities.\u201d  6 Wright & \nMiller, supra, \u00a7 1471 (3d ed.).   \n\n25 \n \nBut that liberal pre-trial policy evaporates post-\njudgment.  After all, \u201ca trial court\u2019s final judgment \n\u2018resolves conclusively the substance of all claims, \nrights, and liabilities of all parties to an action\u2019 and \n\u2018ends the litigation on the merits\u2019 in the district court.\u201d  \nBoyd v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corrs., 114 F.4th 1232, 1237 \n(11th Cir. 2024) (citation omitted).  \u201cSo once the court \nhas entered final judgment, Rule 15(a) no longer \napplies and no amendment is possible unless the \njudgment is first set aside.\u201d  Id.  And, where the \nplaintiff seeks vacatur through Rule 60(b)(6), \n\u201cextraordinary circumstances must justify reopening.\u201d  \nKemp, 596 U.S. at 533 (quotation marks omitted).  \nOnly after making that threshold showing to vacate \nthe judgment may the plaintiff seek leave to amend \nunder Rule 15(a)\u2019s standard.  \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s contrary rule breaks from this \nCourt\u2019s precedents, the history and structure of the \nFederal Rules, and every one of its sister Circuits.  It \nabandons the \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d standard \nin favor of a nebulous \u201cbalanc[ing]\u201d inquiry that pits \nRule 60(b)(6)\u2019s protection of \u201cfinality\u201d against \u201cRule \n15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policies.\u201d  Pet.App.8.  And \nit loads the dice in that balancing test against finality, \nproviding that district courts necessarily abuse their \ndiscretion by \u201cdenying post-judgment relief\u201d based on \nthe movant\u2019s \u201cfailure to demonstrate adequate \ngrounds for relief under Rule 60.\u201d  Mandala, 88 F.4th \nat 362 & n.5. \nNot only does that defy this Court\u2019s precedent, but \nit also violates the cardinal principle that \u201c[c]ourts are \nrequired to give effect to Congress\u2019 express inclusions \nand exclusions, not disregard them.\u201d  Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of \n\n26 \n \nMfrs. v. Dep\u2019t of Def., 583 U.S. 109, 126 (2018).  In Rule \n15(a)(2), Congress adopted this Court\u2019s instruction to \n\u201cfreely give leave\u201d to amend before trial.  Fed. R. Civ. \nP. \n15(a)(2). \n \nBut \nCongress \nand \nthis \nCourt \nconspicuously chose not to do the same in Rule 60(b) \nwhen delineating the \u201cgrounds for relief from a final \njudgment.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) (capitalization \naltered).  The implication from that differing language \nis thus straightforward.  When a plaintiff seeks to \n\u201creopen a final judgment,\u201d as here, \u201cthe policy favoring \nthe finality of judgments [is] implicated,\u201d and \u201c[t]he \npermissive policy favoring amendment under Rule 15 \n[is] simply not relevant.\u201d  Garrett v. Wexford Health, \n938 F.3d 69, 86 (3d Cir. 2019) (emphasis added).  \nIndeed, \u201cthere is no pending complaint to amend\u201d once \n\u201cthe action has been dismissed\u201d with prejudice.  \nCalvary Christian Ctr. v.

Bank of Richmond, 467 \nU.S. 867, 874 (1984). \nAs a result, the \u201cmore restrictive standard\u201d for \ngranting a Rule 60(b) motion \u201cmust be satisfied before \nconsideration can be given to a motion to amend.\u201d  \nDaulatzai, 97 F.4th at 179 (emphasis added).  \nOtherwise, as now-Chief Judge Sutton has explained, \nplaintiffs could \u201csidestep the narrow grounds for \nobtaining post-judgment relief\u201d under Rule 60(b), \n\u201cmake the finality of judgments an interim concept,\u201d \nand risk turning Rule 60(b) into a \u201cnullit[y].\u201d  Leisure \nCaviar, LLC v. U.S. Fish & Wildlife Serv., 616 F.3d \n\n27 \n \n612, 616 (6th Cir. 2010).  There is no good reason for \n\u201cjudgment finality\u201d to be so \u201clightly cast aside.\u201d  United \nStates v.

Rule 60(b)(6) Provides No Basis for Relief \nfrom a Party\u2019s Free, Calculated Choices. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s rebuke of the \u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d test suffers from another shortcoming.  \nIt \ndefies \nthe \nrequirement \nthat \nthe \nalleged \n\u201c\u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019\u201d be such \u201cthat the \n[moving] party is faultless in the delay.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. \nServs., 507 U.S. at 393 (citation omitted); see \nAckermann, 340 U.S. at 198.  Put another way:  The \nmovant must be \u201ccompletely without fault for his or \nher predicament\u201d and \u201cunable to have taken any steps \nthat would have resulted in preventing the judgment \nfrom which relief is sought.\u201d  12 James Wm.

That narrow, \nresidual role for the catchall clause respects the plain \nmeaning of its \u201c\u2018other reason\u2019 language\u201d and \n\u201cprevent[s] clause (6) from being used to circumvent \nthe 1-year limitations period\u201d that applies to clauses \n(1) through (3).  Liljeberg, 486 U.S. at 863 n.11; see \nFed. R. Civ. P. 60(c)(1).  One of those time-limited \ncircumstances is for \u201cexcusable neglect.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 60(b)(1).  Thus, \u201ca party who failed to take timely \naction due to \u2018excusable neglect\u2019 may not seek relief \n\n28 \n \nmore than a year after the judgment by resorting to \nsubsection (6).\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs., 507 U.S. at 393.  \nIf it could, then the \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d provision and \nits limitations would become \u201csuperfluous\u201d and \n\u201cinsignificant.\u201d  TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U.S. 19, 31 \n(2001) (citation omitted).  Such an interpretation \u201cis of \ncourse to be avoided.\u201d  Dastar Corp. v. Twentieth \nCentury Fox Film Corp., 539 U.S. 23, 35 (2003). \nSo too is any interpretation that would excuse a \nparty\u2019s voluntary waiver of a court\u2019s invitation to \namend.  The \u201cusual federal rule of waiver\u201d applies \nregardless of \u201cprejudice\u201d to the party that \u201cknowingly \nrelinquish[ed]\u201d his rights.  Morgan v. Sundance, Inc., \n596 U.S. 411, 417-19 (2022).  And this Court has made \nclear that \u201c[i]t would be \u2018an abuse of discretion\u2019\u201d to \n\u201c\u2018override a [party\u2019s] deliberative waiver.\u2019\u201d  Wood v. \nMilyard, 566 U.S. 463, 472-73 (2012) (quoting Day v. \nMcDonough, 547 U.S. 198, 202 (2006)). \nRule 60(b)(6) is no exception.  As this Court held \nlong ago, parties \u201ccannot be relieved of [their] \nchoice[s]\u201d through that mechanism simply \u201cbecause \nhindsight seems to indicate\u201d the improvidence of their \ndecisions.  Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 198.  A party\u2019s \nwaiver of the right to amend in the normal course\u2014\nlike Respondents\u2019 repeated waivers here\u2014thus cannot \njustify relief from the entry of a final judgment that \nresults from that party\u2019s \u201cconsidered choice.\u201d  Id. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s tortured approach violates \nthese basic principles of waiver.  By requiring district \ncourts to consider Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberality policy in \ntandem with Rule 60\u2019s regard for finality\u2014even when \nthe movant has consistently and consciously rejected \nnumerous invitations and opportunities to amend\u2014\n\n29 \n \nthe Second Circuit has directed district courts to \noverride and rescue parties from their \u201cfree, \ncalculated, [and] deliberate choices.\u201d  Id.  That is \nprecisely the sort of unfair and inefficient relitigation \nloop that this Court has repeatedly warned against.  \n\u201cThere must be an end to litigation someday,\u201d and a \nlitigant\u2019s strategic choices \u201care not to be relieved \nfrom.\u201d  Id. \nC. The Second Circuit\u2019s Outlier Balancing \nTest Is Untenable. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s approach cannot be squared \nwith any of this.  The decision below held that \nRespondents \nneed \nnot \nshow \n\u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d to reopen the final judgment entered \nagainst \nthem \nbecause, \nin \nits \nview, \n\u201cspecial \nconsiderations come into play\u201d when \u201cvacatur is \nsought in order to obtain leave to file an amended \ncomplaint.\u201d  Pet.App.7 (quoting Mandala, 88 F.4th at \n361).  But the court failed to root these supposedly \nspecial considerations in text, context, or precedent.  \nAnd it contradicted each of those sources of legal \nauthority along the way. \n1. The Second Circuit\u2019s Test Is Atextual. \nMost notably, the Second Circuit\u2019s balancing test is \nunmoored from the text of the Federal Rules.  This \nCourt interprets the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \nas it would any statute.  See Bus. Guides, Inc. v. \nChromatic Commc\u2019ns Enters., Inc., 498 U.S. 533, 540-\n41 (1991).  Its analysis in that interpretive enterprise \nalways \u201cbegins with the text.\u201d  Ross v. Blake, 578 U.S. \n632, 638 (2016).  Here, however, the Second Circuit \n\n30 \n \n\u201cmade no attempt to ground its analysis\u201d in the actual \nlanguage of Rule 60(b)(6).  Id. \nNor could it.  Nothing in that Rule\u2019s text compels \ndistricts courts to give \u201c\u2018due regard\u2019 to \u2018the liberal \nspirit of Rule 15\u2019\u201d after final judgment \u201cby ensuring \nplaintiffs at least one opportunity to replead.\u201d  \nMandala, 88 F.4th at 362 (quoting Metzler Inv. GmbH \nv. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., 970 F.3d 133, 146 (2d \nCir. 2020)).  Nothing in the Federal Rules\u2019 text allows \nplaintiffs to leapfrog over \u201cRule 60(b)\u2019s finality \ngauntlet\u201d to the sanctuary of \u201cRule 15(a)\u2019s liberal \nrepleading policy.\u201d  Pet.App.8.  And nothing in the text \ncalls for any exceptions to Rule 60(b)\u2019s demanding \nstandards for \u201cRelief from a Final Judgment.\u201d  Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 60(b). \nMeanwhile, the text of Rule 15(a) expressly \nindicates that it has no role to play after judgment.  \nInstead, it applies only to \u201cAmendments Before Trial.\u201d  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 15(a); see Krupski v. Costa Crociere S. p. \nA., 560 U.S. 538, 553 (2010).  It is in that setting\u2014\nbefore trial and a final judgment\u2014that the Rules \nencourage courts to \u201cfreely give leave\u201d to amend, so \nthat the relevant factual allegations and legal issues \ncan be joined and presented at trial.  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n15(a)(2).  By contrast, Rule 15(a) does not provide any \nmechanism for amending pleadings after dismissal, \nfinal judgment, and affirmance on appeal.  At that \npoint, there are no pending pleadings to amend.  And \nalterations of the final judgment are the province of \nRule 60(b). \nThe Second Circuit thus failed to heed the plain \ntext of both Rule 15(a) and Rule 60(b) when fashioning \nits balancing test.  That led it to fault the District \n\n31 \n \nCourt for evaluating Plaintiffs\u2019 Rule 60(b) motion \n\u201cunder only Rule 60(b)\u2019s standard.\u201d  Pet.App.7.  But \nthat is exactly what the District Court was supposed \nto do.  \u201cPlaintiffs must first meet the threshold \nrequirement of 60(b)(6)\u2019s extraordinary or exceptional \ncircumstances to vacate the judgment before seeking\u201d \nto amend their pleadings.  In re Ferro Corp. Deriv. \nLitig., 511 F.3d 611, 624 (6th Cir. 2008).  The structure \nand plain text of the Federal Rules both make clear \nthat failure to meet that burden forecloses relief. \n2. The Second Circuit\u2019s Test Conflicts \nwith Other Provisions of Rule 60. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s test makes even less sense \nwhen assessed within the \u201ctotal context\u201d of Rule 60.  \nPavelic & LeFlore v. Marvel Ent. Grp., 493 U.S. 120, \n123 (1989).  A Rule 60(b) motion to reopen \u201cmust be \nmade within a reasonable time\u2014and for reasons (1), \n(2), and (3) no more than a year after the entry of the \njudgment.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(c)(1).  Yet the Second \nCircuit\u2019s balancing test for Rule 60(b)(6) enables \nlitigants to evade those explicit time limitations in at \nleast three ways. \nFirst, the Second Circuit\u2019s liberal repleading policy \npermits litigants to bypass Rule 60\u2019s strict time \nlimitations for \u201cexcusable neglect.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n60(b)(1).  If a plaintiff neglects to include certain \nallegations in his complaint and that omission is \n\u201cexcusable,\u201d then he has only one year to move to \nreopen the judgment based on that oversight through \nRule 60(b)(1).  He cannot do the same through Rule \n60(b)(6), as a party cannot \u201c\u2018avail himself\u2019\u201d of that \nprovision \u201cif his motion is based on grounds specified \nin clause (1).\u201d  Liljeberg, 486 U.S. at 863 n.11 (citation \n\n32 \n \nomitted).  But the Second Circuit allows and even \nencourages plaintiffs to do precisely that, by \ncompelling district courts to reopen actions under Rule \n60(b)(6) if the plaintiffs \u201creasonably\u201d (i.e., excusably) \nneglected to include their late-breaking allegations \nbefore final judgment.  Mandala, 88 F.4th at 359, 364.4  \nRather than embrace that misguided approach, this \nCourt \nshould \n\u201cresist\u201d \nany \ninterpretation \nthat \n\u201crender[s] [Rule 60(b)] so internally inconsistent.\u201d  \nJones v. Hendrix, 599 U.S. 465, 479 (2023) (citation \nomitted). \nSecond, the Second Circuit\u2019s balancing test serves \nas an end-run around Rule 60(b)(1)\u2019s time limits for \n\u201cmistake.\u201d  In Mandala, for instance, the Court of \nAppeals held that Rule 60(b)(1) is \u201cinapplicable\u201d\u2014and \nthat \u201c\u2018the liberal spirit of Rule 15\u2019\u201d instead kicks in\u2014\nwhen a \u201cvacatur motion arises from a legal mistake\u201d \nthat leads a plaintiff into \u201cinsufficient pleading.\u201d  88 \nF.4th at 360-62 (emphasis added; citation omitted).  \nYet, there is no reason why that form of \u201clegal mistake\u201d \nwould pull a motion outside of Rule 60(b)(1)\u2019s ambit.  \nThose who drafted and adopted the Rules \u201cchose to \ninclude \u2018mistake\u2019 unqualified.\u201d  Kemp, 596 U.S. at 534.  \n\u201cWhen the Rule was adopted in 1938 and revised in \n \n4  Of course, if a plaintiff \u201cinexcusably\u201d omitted their new \nallegations, that cannot possibly provide a \u201creason that justifies \nrelief.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6) (emphasis added); see, e.g., \nInexcusable, American College Dictionary 621 (Clarence L. \nBarnhart ed., 1953) (\u201cincapable of being justified\u201d); Inexcusable, \nWebster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary 428 (6th ed. 1949) (\u201cnot \nadmitting excuse or justification\u201d).  It is therefore \u201cclear\u201d that \n\u201cinexcusable neglect\u201d similarly \u201cdoes not justify relief under Rule \n60(b)(6).\u201d  Helm v. Resolution Tr. Corp., 84 F.3d 874, 879 (7th Cir. \n1996); see Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 202; PIRS Cap., LLC v. \nWilliams, 54 F.4th 1050, 1055 (8th Cir. 2022). \n\n33 \n \n1946, \nthe \nword \n\u2018mistake\u2019 \napplied \nto \nany \n\u2018misconception,\u2019 \u2018misunderstanding,\u2019 or \u2018fault in \nopinion or judgment.\u2019\u201d  Id. (quoting Webster\u2019s New \nInternational Dictionary 1383 (1914)).  That includes \n\u201cmistakes of law\u201d made by judges and litigants alike.  \nId. at 534-35.  The Second Circuit\u2019s atextual standard \nthus clashes with Rule 60\u2019s limited availability of \nrelief for \u201cmistake\u201d as well.  That provides yet another \ncontextual strike against it. \nThird, the Second Circuit\u2019s approach overrides \nRule 60(b)(2)\u2019s restrictions for vacatur based on new \nevidence.  That provision allows parties \u201cto reopen \nproceedings\u201d based only \u201con matter which could not \nreasonably have been previously adduced\u201d\u2014and even \nthen, only if the party presents that material within a \nyear of final judgment.  INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314, \n326 (1992); see Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(2) (\u201cnewly \ndiscovered evidence that, with reasonable diligence, \ncould not have been discovered in time to move for a \nnew trial\u201d).  This rule is consistent with centuries of \nhistorical \npractice. \n \nSee, \ne.g., \nJoseph \nStory, \nCommentaries on Equity Pleadings 322 (2d ed. 1840) \n(explaining that a final judgment can be reopened \nbased only on \u201csome new matter, which hath arisen in \ntime after the decree, and not on any new proof, which \nmight have been used, when the decree was made\u201d \n(discussing the Ordinances in Chancery of Lord \nChancellor Bacon)); Purcell v. Miner, 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) \n519, 521 (1867) (same).  But, under the Second \nCircuit\u2019s regime, movants can introduce new factual \nallegations through Rule 60(b)(6), even if they could \nhave presented them before, and even if more than a \nyear has elapsed from the entry of final judgment.  See \nMandala, 88 F.4th at 365.  In this way, too, the Second \n\n34 \n \nCircuit has put Rule 60 \u201cat war with itself.\u201d  United \nStates ex rel. Polansky v. Exec. Health Res., Inc., 599 \nU.S. 419, 434 (2023) (citation omitted).  \n3. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s Test Distorts this \nCourt\u2019s Precedents. \nLeft with no support in Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s text or \ncontext, the Second Circuit tried to ground its \nstandard in Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178.  See \nMandala, 88 F.4th at 362; Pet.App.6.  But Foman did \nnot address a Rule 60(b)(6) motion.  This Court instead \nrecognized the motion there (which was filed just a day \nafter the district court\u2019s decision) \u201cas one under Rule \n59(e).\u201d  Foman, 371 U.S. at 179, 181 (emphasis added). \nAs a result, Foman is simply inapt in this setting. \nRather, the controlling precedent is Gonzalez, which \nreaffirmed that a Rule 60(b)(6) motion \u201crequires a \nshowing of \u2018extraordinary circumstances.\u2019\u201d  545 U.S. at \n536.  And there is no basis to conflate that demanding \nstandard with the one for Rule 59(e).  \u201cThe difference \nbetween the two rules . . . is material, both in scope \nand purpose, and, by their own terms, different \nstandards apply.\u201d  Daulatzai, 97 F.4th at 177. \nIndeed, \u201cRule 60(b) differs from Rule 59(e) in just \nabout every way that matters to the inquiry here.\u201d  \nBanister, 590 U.S. at 518; see Daulatzai, 97 F.4th at \n177-78.  A Rule 59(e) motion \u201cis a one-time effort to \nbring alleged errors in a just-issued decision to a \n[district] court\u2019s attention, before taking a single \nappeal.\u201d  Banister, 590 U.S. at 521; see Fed. R. Civ. P. \n59(e).  Accordingly, the time for bringing a Rule 59(e) \nmotion \u201cis short\u201428 days from entry of the judgment, \nwith no possibility of an extension.\u201d  Banister, 590 U.S. \nat 507-08.  And, because \u201c[i]t is a limited continuation \n\n35 \n \nof the original proceeding,\u201d a timely Rule 59(e) motion \nautomatically \n\u201c\u2018suspend[s] \nthe \nfinality\u2019 \nof \nany \njudgment.\u201d  Id. at 514, 521 (citation omitted); see Fed. \nR. App. P. 4(a)(4)(A)(iv).  \u201cOnly the disposition of that \nmotion restores the finality of the original judgment,\u201d \nand \nthat \ndisposition \n\u201cmerges \nwith \nthe \nprior \ndetermination, so that the reviewing court takes up \nonly one judgment\u201d on appeal.  Banister, 590 U.S. at \n508-09 (brackets and quotation marks omitted).  By \ncontrast, \u201c[a] Rule 60(b) motion\u2014often distant in time \nand scope and always giving rise to a separate \nappeal\u2014attacks an already completed judgment,\u201d and \nit \u201c\u2018does not affect the [original] judgment\u2019s finality or \nsuspend its operation.\u201d  Id. at 520-21 (second \nalteration in original) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(c)(2)).  \nA Rule 60(b) motion therefore uniquely \u201cthreaten[s] an \nalready final judgment with successive litigation.\u201d  Id. \nat 519.  Consequently, the \u201cstandard for granting a \nRule 59(e) motion\u201d is more \u201cbroad and open ended\u201d \nthan Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s strict standard for relief.  \nDaulatzai, 97 F.4th at 177.   \nThe Second Circuit failed to grasp these crucial \ndifferences.  Instead, Mandala and the decision below \nwrongly treated Rule 59(e) and Rule 60(b)(6) motions \nas fungible, and then uncritically transplanted \nFoman\u2019s more forgiving Rule 59(e) standard to \noverride the stringent requirements for Rule 60(b)(6).  \nThis Court should reject that misguided approach.  It \ndisregards Rule 60(b)\u2019s unique text and context and \nflouts this Court\u2019s Rule 60(b) precedents. \n\n36 \n \n4. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s Test Undermines \nthe Guiding Principles of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure. \nEven if there were any doubt (which there is not), \nthe Federal Rules would require this Court to resolve \nit against the Second Circuit\u2019s interpretation.  That is \nbecause the Rules state that they must be \u201cconstrued\u201d \nin the face of ambiguity to \u201csecure the just, speedy, and \ninexpensive determination of every action and \nproceeding.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 1.   \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s approach flips those guiding \nprinciples on their head.  It eschews finality, and it \nundermines confidence in the outcome of hard-fought \nlitigation.  It also enables plaintiffs to \u201cuse the court \nas a sounding board to discover holes in their \narguments, then \u2018reopen the case by amending their \ncomplaint to take account of the court\u2019s decision,\u2019\u201d even \nafter testing the complaint against a full appeal and \nrepeatedly declining earlier opportunities to amend.  \nLeisure Caviar, 616 F.3d at 616 (quoting James v. \nWatt, 716 F.2d 71, 78 (1st Cir. 1983) (Breyer, J.)).  Such \ngamesmanship will inevitably draw out litigation and \ndrive up its already high costs.   \nThis case proves the point.  The matter \u201chas been \nclosed since January 15, 2020,\u201d when Petitioner \nsecured a final judgment in its favor.  Pet.App.10.  \nPetitioner prevailed on appeal after that.  Then \nPetitioner successfully showed that Rule 60(b) \nprovided no path for reopening the final judgment.  \nRespondents\u2019 \u201cfail[ure] to satisfy the requirements of \nRule 60(b) should therefore have ended the matter.\u201d  \nDaulatzai, 97 F.4th at 179.  Yet, Respondents continue \nto seek a return to square one\u2014merely so that they \n\n37 \n \ncan plead new factual allegations that were previously \navailable to them and which they had expressly \ndeclined to plead before dismissal. \nAllowing losing litigants to thus restart the loop of \nlitigation would not promote the \u201cspeedy\u201d and \n\u201cinexpensive\u201d resolution of claims.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 1.  \nNor would it be \u201cjust.\u201d  Id.  Quite the opposite:  Like \nthe doctrine of res judicata, Rule 60(b)\u2019s demanding \nrequirements for reopening a final judgment are \nthemselves rooted in \u201cfundamental and substantial \njustice,\u201d and they are designed to further both \u201c\u2018public \npolicy and . . . private peace.\u2019\u201d  Federated Dep\u2019t Stores, \nInc. v. Moitie, 452 U.S. 394, 401 (1981) (citation \nomitted); see supra Section I.A.  They should therefore \n\u201cbe cordially regarded and enforced by the courts.\u201d  \nMoitie, 452 U.S. at 401 (citation omitted).  The \n\u201cweighty interests in finality\u201d must \u201ctrump the \ninterest in giving losing litigants access to an \nadditional\u201d round of proceedings in all but the most \nunusual case.  See San Remo Hotel, L.P. v. City & \nCounty of S.F., 545 U.S. 323, 345 (2005).  That is \nparticularly true when the movant seeks a mulligan to \nrescue himself from his \u201cfree, calculated, deliberate \nchoices.\u201d  Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 198.   \nConsistent with these fundamental tenets of civil \nprocedure, courts have long rejected belated attempts \nby plaintiffs to attack a final judgment with an \namended complaint.  See supra note 3 (collecting \ncases).  They have instead required plaintiffs to put \ntheir best foot forward before judgment or risk an end \nto their lawsuit.  And they have reserved Rule 60(b)(6) \nrelief\u2014as this Court\u2019s precedents command\u2014for only \n\n38 \n \ntruly \u201ccompelling circumstances\u201d outside the movant\u2019s \ncontrol.  James, 716 F.2d at 78 (Breyer, J.). \n*   *   * \nIn sum, Rule 15(a) \u201cgoverns amendment of \npleadings before judgment is entered; it has no \napplication after judgment is entered.\u201d  Jacobs v. \nTempur-Pedic Int\u2019l Inc., 626 F.3d 1327, 1344 (11th Cir. \n2010).  From that point, a party that seeks \u201crelief from \na final judgment\u201d must first satisfy the rigorous \ndemands of Rule 60(b).  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) \n(capitalization altered).5  And where, as here, the \nparty seeks such relief under Rule 60(b)(6), he must \n\u201cshow \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019\u201d beyond his \ncontrol that would \u201cjustify[] the reopening of a final \njudgment.\u201d  Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 535 (quoting \nAckermann, 340 U.S. at 199); see Pioneer Inv. Servs., \n507 U.S. at 393.  Only after surmounting that \nintentionally high hurdle for vacating the judgment \ncan he invoke the more liberal policies of Rule 15(a).  \nThe Second Circuit erred in holding to the contrary. \nII. Respondents Cannot Satisfy Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s \nStringent Standard. \nThis Court should reverse the decision below and \nbring an end to this litigation once and for all.  Unlike \nthe Second Circuit, the District Court applied the \ncorrect legal standard by refusing to \u201c\u2018entertain a \nmotion to amend the complaint\u2019 under Rule 15(a) \nwithout \u2018a valid basis to vacate the previously entered \njudgment\u2019 under Rule 60(b).\u201d  Pet.App.7 (quoting \nDistrict Court\u2019s decision).  It properly treated those \n \n5  Or those of Rule 59(e), if the motion is filed within 28 days \nof the entry of judgment. \n\n39 \n \nRules as posing two distinct inquiries.  And, in a \nthoughtful \nopinion \nissued \nafter \na \npre-motion \nconference and full briefing, it methodically explained \nwhy Respondents \u201chave not demonstrated any \nextraordinary circumstances warranting relief under \nRule 60(b)(6).\u201d  Pet.App.14. \nA. Respondents Have Not Demonstrated \n\u201cExtraordinary Circumstances.\u201d \nWhen a District Court applies the correct legal \nstandard, as here, \u201cRule 60(b) proceedings are subject \nto only limited and deferential appellate review.\u201d  \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. at 535.  An appellate court \u201cmay \nreview the [district court\u2019s] ruling only for abuse of \ndiscretion.\u201d  Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corrs. of Ill., 434 \nU.S. 257, 263 n.7 (1978).  And that standard affords \u201ca \nwide range of choice\u201d to the district court.  McLane Co. \nv. EEOC, 581 U.S. 72, 83 (2017) (citation omitted).  \nAppellate courts cannot \u201cinterfere with the District \nCourt\u2019s exercise of discretion unless\u201d they are left with \n\u201ca definite and firm conviction that the court \ncommitted a clear error of judgment.\u201d  Betterbox \nCommc\u2019ns, Ltd. v. BB Techs, Inc., 300 F.3d 325, 332 \n(3d Cir. 2002) (Alito, J.) (alterations adopted; citation \nomitted).  In other words, the Court must \u201cfind a \ncomplete absence of a reasonable basis and [be] \ncertain that the [District Court\u2019s] decision is wrong.\u201d  \nDavis v. Kan. Dep\u2019t of Corrs., 507 F.3d 1246, 1248 (10th \nCir. 2007) (citation omitted). \nThat is not the case here.  Far from it.  Respondents \nhave never contended \u201cthat any of their proposed new \nallegations were unavailable to them\u201d when they filed \ntheir complaint or when they repeatedly declined the \nDistrict Court\u2019s invitations to amend.  Pet.App.15.  \n\n40 \n \nThey argue only that the Second Circuit \u201cclarified\u201d the \nJASTA pleading standard in some respects in their \nprevious appeal of the District Court\u2019s dismissal.  \nBIO.2.  But that is neither correct nor relevant.   \nIt is not correct because the Second Circuit \naffirmed the dismissal on grounds that the District \nCourt had relied on\u2014namely, that Respondents\u2019 \n\u201callegations do not support an inference that BLOM \nBank was aware of the Three Customers\u2019 ties with \nHamas prior to the relevant attacks.\u201d  Pet.App.49; see \nalso Pet.App.74-75 (\u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 allegations therefore \nfail to raise above the speculative level the specter that \nBLOM was aware of a connection between the Three \nCustomers and Hamas at the time it provided \nfinancial services to the Three Customers.\u201d).  In dicta, \nthe Second Circuit disagreed with other grounds relied \non by the District Court.  But the District Court\u2019s \nindependent conclusion that Respondents failed to \ndemonstrate general awareness at the time of the \nalleged assistance\u2014as JASTA requires\u2014\u201cremain[s] \ncompletely unaffected by anything that was decided or \nsaid\u201d by the Second Circuit in this case or any other.  \nPolites v. United States, 364 U.S. 426, 436 (1960) \n(affirming denial of Rule 60(b) motion).   \nRespondents\u2019 argument is also irrelevant because, \neven if the Second Circuit had clarified its view of the \nlaw, that would not be enough to satisfy Rule 60(b)(6).  \n\u201cIntervening developments in the law by themselves \nrarely\u201d \nif \never \n\u201cconstitute \nthe \nextraordinary \ncircumstances required for relief under Rule 60(b)(6).\u201d  \nAgostini, 521 U.S. at 239; see Pet.App.14-15.  And the \ndevelopments here are by no means groundbreaking.  \nThe governing statute did not change after final \n\n41 \n \njudgment. \n \nRespondents \nmerely \nallege \na \n\u201cclarification[]\u201d of the law by the Second Circuit that \nwas in line with their own interpretation.  BIO.25.  \nThere \nis \nnothing \n\u201cextraordinary\u201d \nabout \nthat.  \nRespondents never \u201cexplain[ed] why they did not \nallege facts sufficient to satisfy the standard for which \nthey were advocating.\u201d  Pet.App.17 n.5.  And clarifying \nthe law is what appellate courts do all the time.  In \nfact, this Court has held that even a \u201cchange in the \nlaw\u201d worked by one of its decisions abrogating \npreviously controlling circuit precedent could not \njustify Rule 60(b)(6) relief.  Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 536-\n37 (emphasis added).  Such a change in decisional \ncaselaw, \nthe \nCourt \nexplained, \nis \n\u201chardly \nextraordinary.\u201d  Id. at 536.  The circumstances here \nare even less so.  \nIn short, the District Court\u2019s determination that \nRespondents failed to satisfy Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s high bar \nfor reopening a final judgment fell well within the \nrange of permissible decisions.  It was not an abuse of \ndiscretion.  It should have been upheld for that reason \nalone. \nB. Respondents Waived or Forfeited Multiple \nOpportunities to Amend Their Complaint. \nNot only did the District Court act within its \ndiscretion, but it would have abused its discretion had \nit ruled the other way.  As this Court has explained, it \nis \u201can abuse of discretion\u201d to \u201coverride a [party\u2019s] \ndeliberative waiver.\u201d  Wood, 566 U.S. at 472-73 \n(citation omitted).  And this case involves waiver many \ntimes over.  Respondents \u201cdo not contend that the \nadditional facts they now propose to allege were not \navailable\u201d to them before, and they \u201cconcede that they \n\n42 \n \ntwice declined the opportunity to amend their \nComplaint before th[e] [District] Court dismissed it.\u201d  \nPet.App.16, 18 n.6.  The District Court rightly held \nthat those repeated waivers foreclosed relief as well.  \nSee Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 198.   \nRespondents first rejected the District Court\u2019s \ninvitation to amend at the pre-motion conference.  \nPet.App.16-17.  Before that conference, Petitioner \nexplained that \u201cthe Complaint alleges nothing more \nthan that [Petitioner] provided routine banking \nservices to organizations that later were revealed to be \nconnected to Hamas.\u201d  JA.145.  \u201c[N]one of the \nallegations, if true, would establish that [Petitioner] \nwas aware of that connection at the time it provided \nthose banking services\u201d to the Three Customers.  Id.  \nAccordingly, the District Court asked Respondents\u2019 \ncounsel if there were \u201cany additional facts [they] could \nadd to the allegations\u201d to address Petitioner\u2019s \narguments.  Pet.App.93.  Respondents\u2019 counsel \n\u201cexpressly declined\u201d the invitation.  Pet.App.17.  The \nDistrict Court then asked a second time if \nRespondents \u201cwould not want to amend\u201d if the Court \n\u201cwere to grant [Petitioner\u2019s] motion.\u201d  Pet.App.93.  \nRespondents unequivocally stated that they \u201cwould \nnot seek leave to amend.\u201d  Pet.App.94.  Hence, the \nDistrict Court issued a minute entry and scheduling \norder to that effect.  JA.156. \nNotwithstanding that entry, the District Court \ngave Respondents yet another chance to amend at oral \nargument \non \nPetitioner\u2019s \nmotion \nto \ndismiss.  \nPet.App.17-18.  At the hearing, the judge explained \nthat she \u201cjust [did not] see any knowledge on the part \nof [Petitioner]\u201d alleged in the complaint.  Pet.App.118.  \n\n43 \n \nShe asked if \u201ceverything [she] need[ed] to consider in \nterms of sufficiency of [the] pleading is going to be \nfound in the complaint that\u2019s filed in this case.\u201d  \nPet.App.124.  And she asked Respondents to confirm \nthat \u201c[t]here are no facts that [Respondents] would \nhave to offer to address some of the contentions of \n[Petitioner] \nregarding \nknowledge, \nespecially.\u201d  \nPet.App.125.  In response, Respondents \u201cagain \nexpressly declined the opportunity to amend their \ncomplaint\u201d and chose to proceed on their complaint as \npled.  Pet.App.18.  That was a \u201ccalculated and \ndeliberate\u201d choice.  Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 198.  Rule \n60(b)(6) therefore \u201chas no application.\u201d  Id. at 202. \nNor did Respondents\u2019 waivers stop there.  Despite \nproceeding up to the Second Circuit, Respondents \n\u201cnever appealed the \u2018with prejudice\u2019 aspect of the \ndismissal\u201d and never argued that the District Court \nshould \nhave \ngranted \nthem \nleave \nto \nreplead.  \nPet.App.16 n.4.  They simply maintained that their \nallegations were sufficient.  The District Court \ncorrectly recognized this litigation choice as still \nanother waiver that precluded Respondents from \nseeking leave to replead if they lost on appeal.  See id. \n(citing 18A Wright & Miller, Federal Practice & \nProcedure \u00a7 4433 (3d ed. 2021) (\u201cA party who elects to \nappeal on one issue, omitting another issue on which \nit lost, is subject to issue preclusion on the issue not \nappealed.\u201d)).   \nThat failure was by itself fatal, even ignoring \nRespondents\u2019 previous waivers.  If a party\u2019s \u201creason \nasserted for [its] Rule 60(b)(6) motion could have been \naddressed on appeal from the judgment,\u201d then the \nmotion must be denied \u201cas merely an inappropriate \n\n44 \n \nsubstitute for an appeal.\u201d  Aikens v. Ingram, 652 F.3d \n496, 501 (4th Cir. 2011) (en banc).  This understanding \nthat Rule 60(b)(6) \u201ccannot be used as a substitute for \nappeal\u201d has been \u201csettled\u201d for decades.  Jean F. \nRydstrom, Construction and Application of Rule \n60(b)(6) of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 15 A.L.R. \nFed. 193, \u00a7 2[a] (2024).  And that principle makes \neminent sense.  Otherwise, parties could skirt the \nlimitations period for post-judgment motions based on \n\u201cmistake, \ninadvertence, \nsurprise, \nor \nexcusable \nneglect,\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1), as well as the \njurisdictional time limits for appealing an adverse \ndecision, see Fed. R. App. P. 4(a); Bowles v. Russell, 551 \nU.S. 205, 206 (2007). \nEach of the foregoing waivers demonstrates that \nRespondents were not \u201cfaultless in the delay.\u201d  Pioneer \nInv. Servs., 507 U.S. at 393.  That delay resulted from \ntheir own strategic decisions, each of which precludes \nrelief.  And, beyond those waivers, Respondents \nforfeited still more opportunities to seek amendment \nof their complaint.  In particular, before failing to \nappeal from the District Court\u2019s \u201cwith prejudice\u201d \nruling, they failed to file a Rule 59(e) motion \nchallenging that aspect of the District Court\u2019s \ndismissal.  And despite being invited to file \nsupplemental briefing in the Second Circuit\u2014after \nthat court issued its controlling decision in Kaplan\u2014\nRespondents still failed to request leave to amend in \nlight of that new precedent.   \nRespondents have thus come nowhere close to \nmeeting Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d \nstandard.  Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 536.  In fact, they \ncould not even satisfy Foman\u2019s more lenient standard \n\n45 \n \nfor Rule 59(e) motions.  Foman held only that a district \ncourt \nerrs \nby \n\u201coutright \nrefus[ing]\u201d \nto \npermit \namendment before appeal \u201cwithout any justifying \nreason.\u201d  371 U.S. at 182.  Here, by contrast, the \nDistrict Court provided many justifying reasons for \ndenying relief (after appellate proceedings had \nalready concluded).  It explained that Respondents \n\u201chad ample opportunity to pursue all legal avenues \navailable to them for relief,\u201d but they simply chose not \nto do so.  Pet.App.16.  They instead engaged in a \n\u201cdocumented series of deliberate choices not to cure \nthe deficiencies identified in their pleading by \n[Petitioner] and [the District] Court.\u201d  Pet.App.19.  \nThose \u201cfree, calculated, deliberate choices are not to be \nrelieved from.\u201d  Id. (quoting Ackermann, 340 U.S. at \n198).  Not only was the District Court\u2019s decision a \npermissible exercise of discretion, but it was \ndemonstrably correct. \n \n \n\n46 \n \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should reverse \nthe judgment below. \n  \n \n \n \n  Respectfully submitted, \nJONATHAN R.

The petitioner argues this is atextual, contrary to precedent emphasizing finality (*Ackermann*, *Gonzalez*), and creates an outlier rule among the circuits. They stress that the respondents made a 'calculated' choice not to amend their complaint when they had the chance. To form a complete picture, I must now understand the respondents' counterarguments. I will search for the brief for the respondents to see how they defend the Second Circuit's approach and justify their post-judgment request to amend."

Circuit courts generally hold that \nmeans providing an opportunity to amend once a ruling \nidentifies remediable defects, if any, in a pleading. Fail-\ning to provide that opportunity may constitute an \u201cex-\ntraordinary circumstance\u201d and a basis to vacate a judg-\nment under Rule 60(b)(6).  \nHere, the Second Circuit found that the district \ncourt dismissed Respondents\u2019 complaint by applying \nthe \u201cwrong legal standard\u201d for pleading an aiding and \nabetting claim (in the Second Circuit) under the Justice \nAgainst Sponsors of Terrorism Act, as well as a stand-\nard for pleading knowledge that was \u201ctoo exacting\u201d and \nall but impossible to meet by amendment. The circuit \ncourt provided clarified pleading standards and identi-\nfied specific, remediable defects in the complaint. Re-\nspondents then promptly moved to vacate the district \ncourt\u2019s judgment in order to meet those clarified stand-\nards in an amended complaint\u2014their first in this litiga-\ntion. The district court refused and, after Respondents \nappealed again, the circuit issued a non-precedential \nsummary order remanding the case for \u201crecon-\nsider[ation].\u201d \nThe question presented is thus whether the circuit \ncourt erred in directing the district court to reconsider \nits refusal to grant Respondents an opportunity to meet \nthe pleading standards the circuit corrected in the prior \nappeal. \n \n \n\nii \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \nQUESTION PRESENTED ............................................. i \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES ......................................... iv \nINTRODUCTION .......................................................... 1 \nSTATEMENT ................................................................ 4 \nI. \nThe Complaint and Pre-Motion Conference for \nBLOM\u2019s Motion to Dismiss .............................. 4 \nII. \nThe Motion to Dismiss ..................................... 7 \nIII.

The dis-\ntrict court had denied vacatur because Plaintiffs de-\nclined its pre-dismissal invitations to amend their \ncomplaint\u2014but the circuit court found the district \ncourt was applying the \u201cwrong\u201d pleading standards, \nPet.App.5, which were so overly \u201cexacting\u201d that Plain-\ntiffs could not meet them before discovery, Pet.App.49.  \nPetitioner (\u201cBLOM\u201d) argues that by making this \nstraightforward remand, the Second Circuit has effec-\ntively \u201cabandon[ed] the \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 \nstandard in favor of a nebulous \u2018balanc[ing]\u2019 inquiry \nthat pits Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s protection of \u2018finality\u2019 against \n\u2018Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policies.\u2019\u201d Pet.Br.25 \n(quoting Pet.App.8). In BLOM\u2019s telling, the Second \nCircuit has \u201cjettisoned\u201d Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s guardrails, \nPet.Br.14., and motions for post-judgment amend-\nments will now be all but rubber-stamped in the cir-\ncuit. This is incorrect. \nFirst of all, this conclusion is not supported by the \nspare language of the summary order, which simply \ndirects the district court to \u201creconsider\u201d denying vaca-\ntur given Second Circuit and Supreme Court prece-\ndents. Nothing has been \u201cabandoned\u201d\u2014consistent \nwith decisions from this Court, \u201c[r]elief under Rule \n60(b)(6)\u201d in the Second Circuit \u201cis reserved for cases \nthat present \u2018extraordinary circumstances,\u2019\u201d including \nwhere a party seeks post-judgment amendment. Man-\ndala v. NTT Data, Inc., 88 F.4th 353, 361 (2d Cir. 2023) \n(citation omitted). Indeed, the standards the Second \n\n \n \n \n \n \n2 \n \nCircuit has \u201cdeveloped\u201d\u2014and reaffirmed by the sum-\nmary order below\u2014\u201cfor evaluating postjudgment mo-\ntions generally place significant emphasis on the \n\u2018value of finality and repose.\u2019\u201d Williams v. Citigroup \nInc., 659 F.3d 208, 213 (2d Cir. 2011) (citation omit-\nted). \nSecond, balancing finality and justice is not \u201cnebu-\nlous,\u201d as BLOM calls it, but rather inherent to Rule \n60(b)(6) jurisprudence: The rule\u2019s \u201cextraordinary cir-\ncumstances\u201d requirement \u201cexists in order to balance \nthe broad language of Rule 60(b)(6), which allows \ncourts to set aside judgments for \u2018any\u2019 reason justify-\ning relief, with the interest in the finality of judg-\nments.\u201d Budget Blinds, Inc. v. White, 536 F.3d 244, \n255 (3d Cir. 2008). When considering a motion to \namend a complaint, finality interests are \u201cbalance[d] \n. . . with the preference expressed in the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure in general, and Rule 15 in particu-\nlar, for resolving disputes on their merits.\u201d Krupski v. \nCosta Crociere S. p. A., 560 U.S. 538, 550 (2010).  \nThird, this case does involve truly \u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d because (1) the district court dismissed \nthe complaint using a set of \u201cwrong legal standards,\u201d \nincluding the nearly impossible requirement of alleg-\ning, without the opportunity for any discovery, \u201cacts or \nstatements\u201d of \u201cBLOM employees\u201d to demonstrate the \nbank\u2019s knowledge; (2) the circuit court rejected those \nstandards on appeal\u2014including the direct evidence re-\nquirement\u2014and \u201cclarified\u201d the correct ones; (3) the cir-\ncuit court found that Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations were none-\ntheless too \u201climited\u201d to meet the clarified standards, \ndrawing a newly announced distinction between \nPlaintiffs\u2019 \u201cpublicly available\u201d evidence and \u201cpublic \nsources such as media articles,\u201d Pet.App.50 & n.18; (4) \nthe circuit court identified several remediable defects \n\n \n \n \n \n \n3 \n \nin the complaint that the district court had not, such \nas clarifying that cash withdrawals are untraceable \nand alleging the degree to which Israeli terrorism des-\nignations were publicized; and (5) Plaintiffs had not \nyet amended their complaint even once. In these one-\nof-a-kind circumstances, the Rules\u2019 strong preference \nfor deciding cases on their merits entitles Plaintiffs to \nhave at least one opportunity to cure those defects. \nBLOM\u2019s argument is therefore premised on con-\nstruing the case\u2019s procedural history to suggest the \nSecond Circuit found that Plaintiffs \u201cwaived\u201d their \nright to amend post-judgment but nevertheless \u201cdi-\nrected district courts to override and rescue parties \nfrom their \u2018free, calculated, [and] deliberate choices,\u2019\u201d \nsuch as \u201cwhen the movant has consistently and con-\nsciously rejected numerous invitations and opportuni-\nties to amend.\u201d Pet.Br.28-29 (citations omitted).  \nBut the Second Circuit never accepted BLOM\u2019s \n\u201cwaiver\u201d argument. To the contrary, it recognized that \nPlaintiffs did not have a meaningful opportunity to \namend at all because \u201cthe district court applied the \nwrong legal standard for aiding-and-abetting liability \nunder JASTA,\u201d Pet.App.5, and a standard for pleading \nknowledge that was \u201ctoo exacting,\u201d Pet.App.49. In fact, \nthe district court\u2019s knowledge pleading standard was \nunmeetable\u2014as Circuit Court Judge Wesley noted in \nresponse to BLOM\u2019s insistence at oral argument that \nPlaintiffs waived opportunities to amend: \u201cWhat are \nthey supposed to do? They know they can\u2019t amend [to] \n. . . meet that.\u201d Oral Arg. at 11:52-:56, Honickman, No. \n22-1039 (2d Cir. Oct. 5, 2023), https://ww3.ca2. \nuscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/6a33dfa3-27c7-4b0a-\n82ee-86c41553c09a/1/doc/22-1039.mp3. \nIgnoring this, BLOM further insists that \u201cthe Sec-\nond Circuit affirmed the dismissal on grounds that the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n4 \n \nDistrict Court had relied on,\u201d Pet.Br. 40\u2014but the dis-\ntrict court itself acknowledged that the decision was \naffirmed \u201con other grounds.\u201d Pet.App.10. Most im-\nportantly, BLOM\u2019s reading of the record is irrelevant \nto the question presented\u2014the summary order below \nwas not premised on any such finding and thus did not \ndirect district courts to \u201coverride\u201d waivers.  \nThe unusual procedural history of this case makes \nclear that no meaningful opportunities to satisfy the \ncorrect legal standards were available to Plaintiffs and \ntherefore the remand to the district court was not a \ndeparture from Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s long-recognized stand-\nards. Rather, in the Second Circuit parties who de-\nclined meaningful invitations \u201care not entitled to relief \nfrom the judgment.\u201d Metzler Inv. GmbH v. Chipotle \nMexican Grill, Inc., 970 F.3d 133, 148 (2d Cir. 2020).  \nThis is not unusual\u2014the circuits broadly require \ndistrict courts to provide at least one opportunity to \namend, often after dismissal when the complaint\u2019s re-\nmediable defects, if any, are correctly identified by a \ncourt ruling. Refusing leave to amend after dismissal \nis thus often an abuse of discretion\u2014the result is no \ndifferent here, except that Plaintiffs were compelled to \nappeal the district court\u2019s erroneous decision first. \nSTATEMENT \nI. \nThe Complaint and Pre-Motion Conference \nfor BLOM\u2019s Motion to Dismiss \nPlaintiffs filed their complaint on January 1, 2019, \nasserting claims under the Anti-Terrorism Act \n(\u201cATA\u201d), as amended by the Justice Against Sponsors \nof Terrorism Act (\u201cJASTA\u201d), and alleging that BLOM \naided and abetted a series of terrorist attacks commit-\nted by the Palestinian foreign terrorist organization \n(\u201cFTO\u201d) Hamas (or \u201cHAMAS\u201d) that injured Plaintiffs. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n5 \n \nSpecifically, Plaintiffs alleged that BLOM knowingly \nprovided substantial assistance to three Hamas fund-\nraisers (the \u201cThree Customers\u201d), including the pur-\nported charitable institution Sanabil, which the \nUnited States designated a Specially Designated \nGlobal Terrorist (\u201cSDGT\u201d) in 2003. Relying in part on \nfinancial records disclosed during the criminal trial of \nthe Holy Land Foundation (\u201cHLF,\u201d a notorious Hamas \nfundraiser) in Texas, Plaintiffs alleged that BLOM as-\nsisted the Three Customers in converting millions of \ndollars of donations from HLF and other Hamas sup-\nporters abroad into cash (notwithstanding BLOM\u2019s de-\nscription of its services as \u201croutine,\u201d Pet.Br.5-6), which \nthey used, inter alia, to recruit Palestinians living in \nLebanon to join and support Hamas before and during \nthe \u201cSecond Intifada,\u201d when the acts of terrorism at is-\nsue here occurred.  \nPlaintiffs alleged BLOM\u2019s knowledge by \u201crefer-\nences to media articles and publications on the Three \nCustomers\u2019 connection to Hamas.\u201d Pet.App.49. Plain-\ntiffs also alleged that Sanabil\u2019s board included contem-\nporaneous Hamas leaders in Lebanon. JA.105, 114. \nPlaintiffs alleged that Israel designated another one of \nthe Three Customers, the Union of Good, as \u201cpart of \nthe Hamas organization\u201d in 2002, during the relevant \nperiod (1998-2004, JA.82). JA.118. The Union of \nGood\u2019s infamous leader, Sheikh Qaradawi, regularly \nappeared on television during that period extolling the \nvirtues of suicide bombings against Israel. JA.120.  \nPlaintiffs also alleged that BLOM converted mil-\nlions of dollars for the Three Customers from not only \nHLF, but also from its successor KindHearts after the \nUnited States designated HLF an SDGT in 2001, \nJA.99-100, 106-13, 117, and from Al Aqsa Foundation \nafter Israel designated it a Hamas entity and its \n\n \n \n \n \n \n6 \n \nheadquarters were shuttered by the German govern-\nment\u2014and one transaction after the United States \ndesignated it an SDGT. JA.95-96, 113.  \nOn May 3, 2019, BLOM filed a letter requesting a \npre-motion conference to initiate a motion to dismiss \nthe complaint for failure to state a claim, setting forth \na summary of its anticipated arguments. JA.142-47. \nThese arguments, which the district court later \nadopted in dismissing the complaint, were incon-\nsistent with JASTA\u2019s plain language, the interpreta-\ntive guidance in Halberstam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472 \n(D.C. Cir. 1983)\u2014which Congress set as the legal \nframework for JASTA\u2014and the Second Circuit\u2019s then-\nonly prior JASTA ruling in Linde v. Arab Bank, PLC, \n882 F.3d 314 (2d Cir. 2018).  \nPlaintiffs provided a summary of their anticipated \nopposition in a letter on May 8, 2019. JA.148-55. Spe-\ncifically, Plaintiffs relied on the standards from both \nLinde and Halberstam and noted that foreseeability \nwas the key factor in assessing a defendant\u2019s wrongful \nconduct under JASTA. As shown below, the district \ncourt ultimately adopted BLOM\u2019s arguments and re-\njected foreseeability. See Pet.App.71-72. The Second \nCircuit subsequently vindicated Plaintiffs\u2019 analysis, as \ndid this Court four years later. See Twitter, Inc. v. \nTaamneh, 598 U.S. 471, 496 (2023).  \nThe district court held a pre-motion conference on \nMay 15, 2019. After raising sua sponte whether BLOM \nhad an affirmative defense based on the statute of lim-\nitations, Pet.App.91, the court then stated:  \nI am just wondering if it might be prudent to \nallow the plaintiffs to amend their complaint, \nnot to add more claims, not to add more parties, \nbut rather to factually support some of the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n7 \n \nclaims that [defense counsel] have identified as \nbeing deficient regarding the standards that \nwere adopted by [Linde] from [Halberstam]. \n[Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel], do you want that oppor-\ntunity?  \nPet.App.93. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel responded, \u201cNo, I think \nwe are prepared to brief it based on the arguments pre-\nsented in [our] pre-motion letter.\u201d Id. This position was \nappropriate given that Plaintiffs\u2019 readings of Linde \nand Halberstam were substantively correct, whereas \nBLOM\u2019s contrary positions were not. \nFollowing the pre-motion conference, the district \ncourt issued a Minute Entry and Scheduling Order \nnoting: \u201cThe Court offered Plaintiffs an opportunity to \namend their complaint to add additional information \nin response to the arguments raised by Defendant. \nPlaintiffs declined . . . to amend their Complaint in \nthis regard.\u201d JA.156 (emphasis added). That is, the \ndistrict court offered Plaintiffs the opportunity to meet \nBLOM\u2019s urged legal standards, which they reasonably \ndeclined\u2014as shown by the circuit\u2019s later \u201cclarification\u201d \nof the applicable standards. \nII. \nThe Motion to Dis\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Circuit courts generally hold that \nmeans providing an opportunity to amend once a ruling \nidentifies remediable defects, if any, in a pleading. Fail-\ning to provide that opportunity may constitute an \u201cex-\ntraordinary circumstance\u201d and a basis to vacate a judg-\nment under Rule 60(b)(6).  \nHere, the Second Circuit found that the district \ncourt dismissed Respondents\u2019 complaint by applying \nthe \u201cwrong legal standard\u201d for pleading an aiding and \nabetting claim (in the Second Circuit) under the Justice \nAgainst Sponsors of Terrorism Act, as well as a stand-\nard for pleading knowledge that was \u201ctoo exacting\u201d and \nall but impossible to meet by amendment. The circuit \ncourt provided clarified pleading standards and identi-\nfied specific, remediable defects in the complaint. Re-\nspondents then promptly moved to vacate the district \ncourt\u2019s judgment in order to meet those clarified stand-\nards in an amended complaint\u2014their first in this litiga-\ntion. The district court refused and, after Respondents \nappealed again, the circuit issued a non-precedential \nsummary order remanding the case for \u201crecon-\nsider[ation].\u201d \nThe question presented is thus whether the circuit \ncourt erred in directing the district court to reconsider \nits refusal to grant Respondents an opportunity to meet \nthe pleading standards the circuit corrected in the prior \nappeal. \n \n \n\nii \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \nQUESTION PRESENTED ............................................. i \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES ......................................... iv \nINTRODUCTION .......................................................... 1 \nSTATEMENT ................................................................ 4 \nI. \nThe Complaint and Pre-Motion Conference for \nBLOM\u2019s Motion to Dismiss .............................. 4 \nII. \nThe Motion to Dismiss ..................................... 7 \nIII.

The dis-\ntrict court had denied vacatur because Plaintiffs de-\nclined its pre-dismissal invitations to amend their \ncomplaint\u2014but the circuit court found the district \ncourt was applying the \u201cwrong\u201d pleading standards, \nPet.App.5, which were so overly \u201cexacting\u201d that Plain-\ntiffs could not meet them before discovery, Pet.App.49.  \nPetitioner (\u201cBLOM\u201d) argues that by making this \nstraightforward remand, the Second Circuit has effec-\ntively \u201cabandon[ed] the \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 \nstandard in favor of a nebulous \u2018balanc[ing]\u2019 inquiry \nthat pits Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s protection of \u2018finality\u2019 against \n\u2018Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policies.\u2019\u201d Pet.Br.25 \n(quoting Pet.App.8). In BLOM\u2019s telling, the Second \nCircuit has \u201cjettisoned\u201d Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s guardrails, \nPet.Br.14., and motions for post-judgment amend-\nments will now be all but rubber-stamped in the cir-\ncuit. This is incorrect. \nFirst of all, this conclusion is not supported by the \nspare language of the summary order, which simply \ndirects the district court to \u201creconsider\u201d denying vaca-\ntur given Second Circuit and Supreme Court prece-\ndents. Nothing has been \u201cabandoned\u201d\u2014consistent \nwith decisions from this Court, \u201c[r]elief under Rule \n60(b)(6)\u201d in the Second Circuit \u201cis reserved for cases \nthat present \u2018extraordinary circumstances,\u2019\u201d including \nwhere a party seeks post-judgment amendment. Man-\ndala v. NTT Data, Inc., 88 F.4th 353, 361 (2d Cir. 2023) \n(citation omitted). Indeed, the standards the Second \n\n \n \n \n \n \n2 \n \nCircuit has \u201cdeveloped\u201d\u2014and reaffirmed by the sum-\nmary order below\u2014\u201cfor evaluating postjudgment mo-\ntions generally place significant emphasis on the \n\u2018value of finality and repose.\u2019\u201d Williams v. Citigroup \nInc., 659 F.3d 208, 213 (2d Cir. 2011) (citation omit-\nted). \nSecond, balancing finality and justice is not \u201cnebu-\nlous,\u201d as BLOM calls it, but rather inherent to Rule \n60(b)(6) jurisprudence: The rule\u2019s \u201cextraordinary cir-\ncumstances\u201d requirement \u201cexists in order to balance \nthe broad language of Rule 60(b)(6), which allows \ncourts to set aside judgments for \u2018any\u2019 reason justify-\ning relief, with the interest in the finality of judg-\nments.\u201d Budget Blinds, Inc. v. White, 536 F.3d 244, \n255 (3d Cir. 2008). When considering a motion to \namend a complaint, finality interests are \u201cbalance[d] \n. . . with the preference expressed in the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure in general, and Rule 15 in particu-\nlar, for resolving disputes on their merits.\u201d Krupski v. \nCosta Crociere S. p. A., 560 U.S. 538, 550 (2010).  \nThird, this case does involve truly \u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d because (1) the district court dismissed \nthe complaint using a set of \u201cwrong legal standards,\u201d \nincluding the nearly impossible requirement of alleg-\ning, without the opportunity for any discovery, \u201cacts or \nstatements\u201d of \u201cBLOM employees\u201d to demonstrate the \nbank\u2019s knowledge; (2) the circuit court rejected those \nstandards on appeal\u2014including the direct evidence re-\nquirement\u2014and \u201cclarified\u201d the correct ones; (3) the cir-\ncuit court found that Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations were none-\ntheless too \u201climited\u201d to meet the clarified standards, \ndrawing a newly announced distinction between \nPlaintiffs\u2019 \u201cpublicly available\u201d evidence and \u201cpublic \nsources such as media articles,\u201d Pet.App.50 & n.18; (4) \nthe circuit court identified several remediable defects \n\n \n \n \n \n \n3 \n \nin the complaint that the district court had not, such \nas clarifying that cash withdrawals are untraceable \nand alleging the degree to which Israeli terrorism des-\nignations were publicized; and (5) Plaintiffs had not \nyet amended their complaint even once. In these one-\nof-a-kind circumstances, the Rules\u2019 strong preference \nfor deciding cases on their merits entitles Plaintiffs to \nhave at least one opportunity to cure those defects. \nBLOM\u2019s argument is therefore premised on con-\nstruing the case\u2019s procedural history to suggest the \nSecond Circuit found that Plaintiffs \u201cwaived\u201d their \nright to amend post-judgment but nevertheless \u201cdi-\nrected district courts to override and rescue parties \nfrom their \u2018free, calculated, [and] deliberate choices,\u2019\u201d \nsuch as \u201cwhen the movant has consistently and con-\nsciously rejected numerous invitations and opportuni-\nties to amend.\u201d Pet.Br.28-29 (citations omitted).  \nBut the Second Circuit never accepted BLOM\u2019s \n\u201cwaiver\u201d argument. To the contrary, it recognized that \nPlaintiffs did not have a meaningful opportunity to \namend at all because \u201cthe district court applied the \nwrong legal standard for aiding-and-abetting liability \nunder JASTA,\u201d Pet.App.5, and a standard for pleading \nknowledge that was \u201ctoo exacting,\u201d Pet.App.49. In fact, \nthe district court\u2019s knowledge pleading standard was \nunmeetable\u2014as Circuit Court Judge Wesley noted in \nresponse to BLOM\u2019s insistence at oral argument that \nPlaintiffs waived opportunities to amend: \u201cWhat are \nthey supposed to do? They know they can\u2019t amend [to] \n. . . meet that.\u201d Oral Arg. at 11:52-:56, Honickman, No. \n22-1039 (2d Cir. Oct. 5, 2023), https://ww3.ca2. \nuscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/6a33dfa3-27c7-4b0a-\n82ee-86c41553c09a/1/doc/22-1039.mp3. \nIgnoring this, BLOM further insists that \u201cthe Sec-\nond Circuit affirmed the dismissal on grounds that the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n4 \n \nDistrict Court had relied on,\u201d Pet.Br. 40\u2014but the dis-\ntrict court itself acknowledged that the decision was \naffirmed \u201con other grounds.\u201d Pet.App.10. Most im-\nportantly, BLOM\u2019s reading of the record is irrelevant \nto the question presented\u2014the summary order below \nwas not premised on any such finding and thus did not \ndirect district courts to \u201coverride\u201d waivers.  \nThe unusual procedural history of this case makes \nclear that no meaningful opportunities to satisfy the \ncorrect legal standards were available to Plaintiffs and \ntherefore the remand to the district court was not a \ndeparture from Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s long-recognized stand-\nards. Rather, in the Second Circuit parties who de-\nclined meaningful invitations \u201care not entitled to relief \nfrom the judgment.\u201d Metzler Inv. GmbH v. Chipotle \nMexican Grill, Inc., 970 F.3d 133, 148 (2d Cir. 2020).  \nThis is not unusual\u2014the circuits broadly require \ndistrict courts to provide at least one opportunity to \namend, often after dismissal when the complaint\u2019s re-\nmediable defects, if any, are correctly identified by a \ncourt ruling. Refusing leave to amend after dismissal \nis thus often an abuse of discretion\u2014the result is no \ndifferent here, except that Plaintiffs were compelled to \nappeal the district court\u2019s erroneous decision first. \nSTATEMENT \nI. \nThe Complaint and Pre-Motion Conference \nfor BLOM\u2019s Motion to Dismiss \nPlaintiffs filed their complaint on January 1, 2019, \nasserting claims under the Anti-Terrorism Act \n(\u201cATA\u201d), as amended by the Justice Against Sponsors \nof Terrorism Act (\u201cJASTA\u201d), and alleging that BLOM \naided and abetted a series of terrorist attacks commit-\nted by the Palestinian foreign terrorist organization \n(\u201cFTO\u201d) Hamas (or \u201cHAMAS\u201d) that injured Plaintiffs. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n5 \n \nSpecifically, Plaintiffs alleged that BLOM knowingly \nprovided substantial assistance to three Hamas fund-\nraisers (the \u201cThree Customers\u201d), including the pur-\nported charitable institution Sanabil, which the \nUnited States designated a Specially Designated \nGlobal Terrorist (\u201cSDGT\u201d) in 2003. Relying in part on \nfinancial records disclosed during the criminal trial of \nthe Holy Land Foundation (\u201cHLF,\u201d a notorious Hamas \nfundraiser) in Texas, Plaintiffs alleged that BLOM as-\nsisted the Three Customers in converting millions of \ndollars of donations from HLF and other Hamas sup-\nporters abroad into cash (notwithstanding BLOM\u2019s de-\nscription of its services as \u201croutine,\u201d Pet.Br.5-6), which \nthey used, inter alia, to recruit Palestinians living in \nLebanon to join and support Hamas before and during \nthe \u201cSecond Intifada,\u201d when the acts of terrorism at is-\nsue here occurred.  \nPlaintiffs alleged BLOM\u2019s knowledge by \u201crefer-\nences to media articles and publications on the Three \nCustomers\u2019 connection to Hamas.\u201d Pet.App.49. Plain-\ntiffs also alleged that Sanabil\u2019s board included contem-\nporaneous Hamas leaders in Lebanon. JA.105, 114. \nPlaintiffs alleged that Israel designated another one of \nthe Three Customers, the Union of Good, as \u201cpart of \nthe Hamas organization\u201d in 2002, during the relevant \nperiod (1998-2004, JA.82). JA.118. The Union of \nGood\u2019s infamous leader, Sheikh Qaradawi, regularly \nappeared on television during that period extolling the \nvirtues of suicide bombings against Israel. JA.120.  \nPlaintiffs also alleged that BLOM converted mil-\nlions of dollars for the Three Customers from not only \nHLF, but also from its successor KindHearts after the \nUnited States designated HLF an SDGT in 2001, \nJA.99-100, 106-13, 117, and from Al Aqsa Foundation \nafter Israel designated it a Hamas entity and its \n\n \n \n \n \n \n6 \n \nheadquarters were shuttered by the German govern-\nment\u2014and one transaction after the United States \ndesignated it an SDGT. JA.95-96, 113.  \nOn May 3, 2019, BLOM filed a letter requesting a \npre-motion conference to initiate a motion to dismiss \nthe complaint for failure to state a claim, setting forth \na summary of its anticipated arguments. JA.142-47. \nThese arguments, which the district court later \nadopted in dismissing the complaint, were incon-\nsistent with JASTA\u2019s plain language, the interpreta-\ntive guidance in Halberstam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472 \n(D.C. Cir. 1983)\u2014which Congress set as the legal \nframework for JASTA\u2014and the Second Circuit\u2019s then-\nonly prior JASTA ruling in Linde v. Arab Bank, PLC, \n882 F.3d 314 (2d Cir. 2018).  \nPlaintiffs provided a summary of their anticipated \nopposition in a letter on May 8, 2019. JA.148-55. Spe-\ncifically, Plaintiffs relied on the standards from both \nLinde and Halberstam and noted that foreseeability \nwas the key factor in assessing a defendant\u2019s wrongful \nconduct under JASTA. As shown below, the district \ncourt ultimately adopted BLOM\u2019s arguments and re-\njected foreseeability. See Pet.App.71-72. The Second \nCircuit subsequently vindicated Plaintiffs\u2019 analysis, as \ndid this Court four years later. See Twitter, Inc. v. \nTaamneh, 598 U.S. 471, 496 (2023).  \nThe district court held a pre-motion conference on \nMay 15, 2019. After raising sua sponte whether BLOM \nhad an affirmative defense based on the statute of lim-\nitations, Pet.App.91, the court then stated:  \nI am just wondering if it might be prudent to \nallow the plaintiffs to amend their complaint, \nnot to add more claims, not to add more parties, \nbut rather to factually support some of the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n7 \n \nclaims that [defense counsel] have identified as \nbeing deficient regarding the standards that \nwere adopted by [Linde] from [Halberstam]. \n[Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel], do you want that oppor-\ntunity?  \nPet.App.93. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel responded, \u201cNo, I think \nwe are prepared to brief it based on the arguments pre-\nsented in [our] pre-motion letter.\u201d Id. This position was \nappropriate given that Plaintiffs\u2019 readings of Linde \nand Halberstam were substantively correct, whereas \nBLOM\u2019s contrary positions were not. \nFollowing the pre-motion conference, the district \ncourt issued a Minute Entry and Scheduling Order \nnoting: \u201cThe Court offered Plaintiffs an opportunity to \namend their complaint to add additional information \nin response to the arguments raised by Defendant. \nPlaintiffs declined . . . to amend their Complaint in \nthis regard.\u201d JA.156 (emphasis added). That is, the \ndistrict court offered Plaintiffs the opportunity to meet \nBLOM\u2019s urged legal standards, which they reasonably \ndeclined\u2014as shown by the circuit\u2019s later \u201cclarification\u201d \nof the applicable standards. \nII. \nThe Motion to Dismiss \nThe parties then briefed the motion to dismiss, in \nwhich they presented arguments largely consistent \nwith the summaries set forth in their pre-motion let-\nters.  \nDuring oral argument on the motion to dismiss, \nBLOM\u2019s counsel relied heavily on a district court deci-\nsion, Kaplan v. Lebanese Canadian Bank, SAL, 405 F. \nSupp. 3d 525 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (\u201cKaplan I\u201d), vac\u2019d in rel-\nevant part, 999 F.3d 842 (2d Cir. 2021) (\u201cKaplan II\u201d). \nKaplan I dismissed JASTA claims against Lebanese \nCanadian Bank (\u201cLCB\u201d), premised on allegations that \n\n \n \n \n \n \n8 \n \nLCB provided financial services for the terrorist group \nHezbollah. As BLOM pointed out, BLOM allegedly \nprovided financial services for Hamas fundraisers in \nLebanon much as LCB did for entities controlled by \nHezbollah. Pet.App.131. \nBLOM urged the district court to adopt Kaplan I\u2019s \nerroneous pleading standards\u2014including its unwork-\nable standard for pleading scienter. Under that stand-\nard, the Kaplan I district court held that public state-\nments and media reports tying five of LCB\u2019s customers \nto Hezbollah could not support an inference of LCB\u2019s \nknowledge of those ties because \u201cPlaintiffs nowhere al-\nlege . . . that Defendant read or was aware of such \nsources.\u201d 405 F. Supp. 3d at 535. Naturally, before dis-\ncovery, a plaintiff will rarely be able to find support for \nwhat sources a defendant has actually \u201cread\u201d or was \naware of. See Pet.App.50 n.18 (\u201cpublic sources\u201d can \n\u201cplausibly suggest a defendant\u2019s knowledge which can \nbe confirmed during discovery\u201d) (emphasis added).  \nNonetheless, BLOM\u2019s counsel argued: \nFinally, I wanted to point out that the level of \nknowledge that Judge Daniels rejected in \nKaplan [I] was very much what\u2019s claimed here, \nwhere it said that it was notorious that there \nwere links between the accounts at issue there, \nbetween those persons and in that case, Hezbol-\nlah. And that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s said here. It was \napparently notorious that BLOM should have \nknown that these accounts were linked to HA-\nMAS, but there\u2019s no direct allegation of why \nBLOM should have known that.  \nPet.App.131. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel disagreed, arguing \n\u201cKaplan [I] requires a level of proof that is out of step \n\n \n \n \n \n \n9 \n \nwith JASTA, out of step with Linde and would be im-\npossible to meet.\u201d Pet.App.126.  \nDuring the oral argument, the district court again \nasked: \u201cThere are no facts that you would have to offer \nto address some of the contentions of the defendants \nregarding knowledge, especially?\u201d Pet.App.125 (em-\nphasis added). But these \u201ccontentions\u201d premised on \nKaplan I were impossible to meet on amendment\u2014\nPlaintiffs possessed no evidence that any BLOM em-\nployee \u201cread or was aware of\u201d any specific piece of in-\nformation. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel explained that while \nthey \u201ccould always add allegations, . . . the complaint \ngoes far enough in saying that BLOM holding accounts \nfor Specially Designated Global Terrorists designated \nfor . . . financing HAMAS, was generally aware of its \nrole in that [il]licit conduct, and . . . the violence that \nresulted from it was foreseeable\u201d as set forth in Linde. \nId. \nIII. \nThe District Court\u2019s Decision on the Motion \nto Dismiss and First Appeal \nThe district court granted BLOM\u2019s motion to dis-\nmiss on January 14, 2020 (\u201cHonickman I\u201d), largely on \nthe grounds BLOM raised, including\u2014as BLOM \nurged\u2014by relying heavily on Kaplan I. The district \ncourt called Kaplan I \u201ca more appropriate comparison\u201d \nand \u201ca more appropriate point of reference\u201d than other \nJASTA and ATA cases to which Plaintiffs analogized \ntheir complaint. Pet.App.77, 84.  \nFor example, and of particular importance to the \nquestion presented here, the district court adopted \nKaplan I\u2019s \u201cread-or-was-aware-of\u201d standard for plead-\ning knowledge. The district court explained that in \nKaplan I, \n\n \n \n \n \n \n10 \n \nalthough the plaintiffs argued that the entities\u2019 \nconnections to Hizbollah \u201cwas [sic] openly, pub-\nlicly and repeatedly acknowledged and publi-\ncized by Hizbollah [through its own sources]\u201d \nand \u201cin various English-language publications,\u201d \nthe plaintiffs \u201cnowhere allege[d] . . . that [LCB] \nread or was aware of such sources.\u201d The same \nanalysis applies even more strongly here, given \nthe relatively greater strength of the allegations \nin Kaplan [I]. \nPet.App.79 (quoting Kaplan I, 405 F. Supp. 3d at 535) \n(emphasis added). Having adopted this position, the \ndistrict court then faulted Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint for \nlacking allegations citing \u201cacts or statements by \nBLOM or BLOM\u2019s employees\u201d regarding its customers\u2019 \naffiliations with Hamas, instead relying on \u201cpress ar-\nticles, government actions, and allegedly \u2018public \nknowledge\u2019 discussing\u201d such connections. Pet.App.73-\n74.  \nUnsurprisingly, financial institutions do not often \npublicly admit their knowledge of their roles in assist-\ning terrorism. Therefore, moving to amend after dis-\nmissal in this case\u2014or accepting the district court\u2019s in-\nvitations to amend, such as during oral argument \nwhere BLOM demanded \u201cdirect allegation[s]\u201d of its \nknowledge, Pet.App.131\u2014would have been pointless. \nAnd while the Second Circuit also ultimately found \nPlaintiffs\u2019 allegations of BLOM\u2019s knowledge of the \nThree Customers\u2019 Hamas affiliations insufficient, it \ndid so for reasons that could be remedied by replead-\ning\u2014such as by pleading more allegations of (1) \u201cpub-\nlic sources\u201d demonstrating that Israeli terrorism des-\nignations were made public, (2) banks\u2019 policies for \nmonitoring counterparties, and (3) the untraceable na-\nture of cash. None of those grounds required alleging \n\n \n \n \n \n \n11 \n \nBLOM\u2019s internal communications or deliberations at \nthe pleading stage showing that BLOM \u201cread or was \naware\u201d of such sources.  \nPlaintiffs timely appealed the district court\u2019s dis-\nmissal decision. Because Kaplan I was also on appeal, \nthe Second Circuit held Honickman in abeyance and \ndirected the parties to submit supplemental briefs on \nthe \u201cissue of how [Kaplan] applies to this case,\u201d once \ndecided. JA.257-258. The circuit subsequently issued \nKaplan II, vacating Kaplan I\u2019s dismissal of JASTA aid-\ning and abetting claims against LCB. See 999 F.3d \n842. Kaplan II largely clarified the standards for \nJASTA liability, as Plaintiffs explained in their sup-\nplemental brief. JA.259-281. BLOM, however, argued \nthat Kaplan II somehow \u201cunderscore[d] the soundness \nof the District Court\u2019s legal analysis,\u201d despite vacating \nits primary support\u2014Kaplan I. JA.294. The circuit \nthen issued its first decision in Honickman on July 29, \n2021 (\u201cHonickman II\u201d). \nIV. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s Assessment of the Dis-\ntrict Court\u2019s Dismissal Decision  \nThe Second Circuit \u201cagree[d]\u201d with Plaintiffs \u201cthat \nthe [district] court did not apply the proper standard \n. . . .\u201d Pet.App.24. Specifically, the circuit rejected \nevery standard the district court applied as grounds \nfor dismissal, including the direct-evidence standard \nfor alleging BLOM\u2019s knowledge of the Three Custom-\ners\u2019 affiliations with Hamas. It also rejected the dis-\ntrict court\u2019s standards for alleging the general aware-\nness and substantial assistance elements, which to-\ngether \u201cform the crux of most JASTA aiding-and-abet-\nting cases.\u201d Pet.App.37. These holdings are detailed \nbelow. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n12 \n \nBLOM \nlargely \nignores \nthese \nholdings. \nSee \nPet.Br.40. But the district court was more forthcom-\ning\u2014it acknowledged that the circuit court only af-\nfirmed on \u201cother grounds.\u201d Pet.App.10. BLOM also \ntries to rehabilitate the district court\u2019s dismissal order \nby suggesting it conforms to this Court\u2019s analysis in \nTaamneh. See Pet.Br.6-7, 8 n.2. But, of course, \nTaamneh affirmed the foreseeability standard from \nHalberstam\u2014the Honickman district court, \u201chowever, \nrejected the foreseeability principle.\u201d Pet.App.39.  \nMoreover, Taamneh had not been issued when \nPlaintiffs sought post-judgment amendment to meet \nthe Second Circuit\u2019s \u201cclarifications\u201d in Kaplan II and \nHonickman II. The issue in this case is the standard \nfor post-judgment amendment where a district court \nhas misapplied controlling law\u2014that is, the law of the \ncircuit. And even if Taamneh had completely repudi-\nated the Second Circuit\u2019s interpretation of JASTA, \nthat would only have provided a further reason to af-\nford Plaintiffs an opportunity to meet this Court\u2019s \nnewly-articulated standard. \nA. The District Court Applied the Wrong \nStandard for Pleading Knowledge \nThe most decisive problem with the district court\u2019s \ndismissal decision was its articulated standard for \npleading knowledge, which required Plaintiffs to al-\nlege \u201cacts or statements by BLOM or BLOM\u2019s employ-\nees\u201d showing their knowledge. Pet.App.73. The Second \nCircuit explained why this standard was incorrect:  \nIn assessing this element, the district court \nfound that the complaint\u2019s references to media \narticles and publications on the Three Custom-\ners\u2019 connection to Hamas were insufficient be-\ncause \u201cPlaintiffs fail[ed] plausibly to allege that \n\n \n \n \n \n \n13 \n \nBLOM [Bank] . . . actually knew or should have \nknown of any of the cited sources.\u201d However, as \nwe explained in Kaplan [II], Plaintiffs did not \nneed to allege that BLOM Bank knew or should \nhave known of the public sources at the plead-\ning stage. Such a requirement at this juncture \nwould be too exacting. \nPet.App.49 (citations omitted). \nThe district court had adopted its erroneous stand-\nard from Kaplan I, before it was vacated in relevant \npart. In Kaplan II, the circuit explained that \u201c[a] com-\nplaint is allowed to contain general allegations as to a \ndefendant\u2019s knowledge because \u2018a plaintiff realistically \ncannot be expected to plead a defendant\u2019s actual state \nof mind,\u2019\u201d although plaintiffs must \u201cinclude allegations \nof the facts or events they claim give rise to an infer-\nence of knowledge.\u201d 999 F.3d at 864 (citations omit-\nted). Moreover, the district court must \u201cconsider all of \nthe complaint\u2019s allegations, rather than considering \neach in isolation, and to accept as true all permissible \ninferences that could be drawn from the complaint as \na whole.\u201d Id. at 865.1  \nThis correction is critical. While Plaintiffs\u2019 pro-\nposed amended complaint submitted in support of \n \n1  \nThe Honickman district court also echoed Kaplan I in \npointing out that with one exception cited in the complaint, the \nU.S. did not designate the Three Customers or their counterpar-\nties as SDGTs until after the transfers at issue (although Israel \nhad designated several of the counterparties as terrorist organi-\nzations years before). See Pet.App.74-75. The circuit rejected this \nstandard in Kaplan II as well, writing: \u201cThe [Kaplan I] court cited \nno authority for such a prerequisite for knowledge, and we know \nof none; and it would defy common sense to hold that such \nknowledge could be gained in no other way.\u201d 999 F.3d at 864. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n14 \n \ntheir vacatur motion contained numerous additional \n\u201cpublic source\u201d allegations (including publications in \nEnglish, French and Arabic) to further support the \n\u201cpermissible inferences\u201d of BLOM\u2019s contemporaneous \nknowledge that it was providing substantial assis-\ntance to Hamas, JA.315-508, those allegations would \nnot satisfy Kaplan I\u2019s \u201cread or was aware of\u201d require-\nment adopted by the district court below. \nB. The District Court Applied the Wrong \nJASTA Standards \nThe Second Circuit also explained that the district \ncourt applied the wrong standards for assessing the \nJASTA elements.  \nAs to general awareness, the Second Circuit first \nset forth the standard given in Halberstam and \nacknowledged in Linde: \u201c[t]he defendant need not be \ngenerally aware of its role in the specific act that \ncaused the plaintiff\u2019s injury; instead, it must be gener-\nally aware of its role in an overall illegal activity from \nwhich the act that caused the plaintiff\u2019s injury was \nforeseeable.\u201d Pet.App.37 (citing Halberstam, 705 F.2d \nat 477, 488). It then explained that the district court \ndid not apply this standard:  \nThe district court, however, rejected the foresee-\nability principle, holding that \u201cit is not enough \nfor Plaintiffs to plausibl[y] allege that BLOM \n[Bank] was generally aware of [its] role in ter-\nrorist activities, from which terrorist attacks \nwere a natural and foreseeable consequence.\u201d \nThe court\u2019s conclusion contravenes both Hal-\nberstam and Linde[], one of the first cases in \nwhich we interpreted aiding-and-abetting lia-\nbility under JASTA. \nPet.App.39 (quoting Pet.App.71-72).  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n15 \n \nIn Taamneh, this Court likewise confirmed that:  \nAs Halberstam makes clear, people who aid and \nabet a tort can be held liable for other torts that \nwere \u201ca foreseeable risk\u201d of the intended \ntort. Accordingly, a close nexus between the as-\nsistance and the tort might help establish that \nthe defendant aided and abetted the tort, but \neven more remote support can still constitute \naiding and abetting in the right case. \n598 U.S. at 496 (quoting Halberstam, 705 F.2d at 488). \nThe Second Circuit rejected BLOM\u2019s argument \nthat providing indirect assistance changes the stand-\nard for pleading knowledge, explaining that \u201cKaplan \n[II] did not so hold; instead, it asserted \u2018the actual \nknowledge component of the Halberstam standard re-\nquires that the defendant \u201cknow[ ]\u201d that it is providing \n\u201cassistance,\u201d . . . whether directly to the FTO or indi-\nrectly through an intermediary.\u2019\u201d Pet.App.46 n.16 \n(quoting Kaplan II, 999 F.3d at 863-64). See also \nPet.App.45 n.15 (rejecting BLOM\u2019s argument regard-\ning customer activities).  \nThe circuit\u2019s Honickman II and Kaplan II decisions \nalso rejected the district court\u2019s assertion that \u201cthe \nmere provision of routine banking services to an FTO \ndoes not render a bank liable for civil aiding and abet-\nting.\u201d Pet.App.71. The Kaplan II court explained that \nso-called \u201croutine\u201d services could suffice depending on \nthe circumstances, and that, under Linde, \u201cwhether a \ndefendant bank\u2019s \u2018financial services to [an FTO or its \naffiliates should or] should not be viewed as routine\u2019 is \na \u2018question[] of fact for a jury to decide.\u2019\u201d 999 F.3d at \n858 (quoting Linde, 882 F.3d at 327) (alterations orig-\ninal to Kaplan II). See also Taamneh, 598 U.S. at 502 \n(noting circumstances \u201cwhere the provider of routine \n\n \n \n \n \n \n16 \n \nservices\u201d could be liable for \u201caiding and abetting a fore-\nseeable terror attack\u201d). \nThe Second Circuit also found that the district \ncourt applied incorrect standards to plead the knowing \nand substantial assistance element. This included \nmisapprehending the \u201cknowing\u201d prong under circuit \nlaw2 and misapplying each of the Halberstam substan-\ntial assistance factors it analyzed. Pet.App.45.  \nThe district court \u201cmisunderstood the first factor, \n\u2018the nature of the act encouraged,\u2019 to be a question of \nwhether Plaintiffs plausibly alleged \u2018that BLOM \n[Bank] knowingly encouraged Hamas\u2019[s] violent activ-\nities, such as those which caused Plaintiffs\u2019 injuries.\u2019\u201d \nPet.App.46. Indeed, the Halberstam defendant did not \n\u201cencourage\u201d her burglar boyfriend to commit the un-\nplanned murder of Dr. Halberstam, of which she had \nno knowledge.  \nThe district court also applied too exacting a stand-\nard for \u201cthe second factor, \u2018the amount of assistance,\u2019\u201d \nrequiring allegations of how the money BLOM moved \nfor Hamas actually made it through the FTO\u2019s fronts. \nTo the contrary, \u201c[f]actual allegations that permit a \nreasonable inference that the defendant recognized \nthe money it transferred to its customers would be re-\nceived by the FTO would suffice.\u201d Pet.App.47. \n \n2  \nThe Second Circuit did not, as some JASTA defendants \nhave suggested, \u201canalyze[] the \u2018knowing\u2019 subelement as a carbon \ncopy of the antecedent element of whether the defendants were \n\u2018generally aware\u2019 of their role in ISIS\u2019 overall scheme.\u201d Taamneh, \n598 U.S. at 503 (citations omitted). It only observed that the same \nfacts could satisfy both mental state elements: \u201cFor instance, Hal-\nberstam . . . . did not require [the defendant] to \u2018know\u2019 anything \nmore about [the murderer\u2019s] unlawful activities than what she \nknew for the general awareness element.\u201d Pet.App.46.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n17 \n \nFinally, under the fourth factor, the defendant\u2019s re-\nlation to the principal, \u201c[t]he district court erroneously \nconstrued\u201d Second Circuit precedent \u201cto mean that \nPlaintiffs must plead a direct relationship between \nBLOM Bank and Hamas.\u201d Pet.App.47-48. A less direct \nrelationship, depending on the circumstances, could \nsuffice. \nAgain, these errors align with BLOM\u2019s \u201cargu-\nments\u201d and \u201ccontentions\u201d to which the district court \ninvited Plaintiffs to respond by amendment. JA.156, \nPet.App.125. Plaintiffs reasonably declined these invi-\ntations, as evidenced by the Second Circuit\u2019s complete \nrejection of them. \nC. The Second Circuit Affirmed the District \nCourt Decision Only on Another Ground \nThe Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal decision \nentirely on one ground: \u201cWe conclude that Plaintiffs\u2019 \naiding-and-abetting claim fails because the allegations \ndo not support an inference that BLOM Bank was \naware of the Three Customers\u2019 ties with Hamas prior \nto the relevant attacks, thereby undermining the sec-\nond element of general awareness.\u201d Pet.App.49. But \nwhereas the district court required allegations of \u201cacts \nor statements\u201d from \u201cBLOM employees\u201d demonstrat-\ning their actual knowledge (which Plaintiffs naturally \ndid not have before discovery), the Second Circuit \nidentified a less exacting set of specific and remediable \ndeficiencies in the complaint\u2019s knowledge allegations. \nChief among these was the circuit\u2019s finding that \nPlaintiffs\u2019 evidence of the Three Customers\u2019 Hamas af-\nfiliations was \u201cpublicly available,\u201d rather than from \n\u201cpublic sources\u201d: \nHowever, \u201cpublicly available\u201d evidence is not \nthe same as public sources such as media \n\n \n \n \n \n \n18 \n \narticles. The latter, depending on their sub-\nstance, \nplausibly \nsuggest \na \ndefendant\u2019s \nknowledge which can be confirmed during dis-\ncovery, whereas the former requires the implau-\nsible inference that the defendant was aware of \nthose facts even before the news media. \nPet.App.50 n.18. The court then went on to find Plain-\ntiffs\u2019 allegations of \u201cpublic sources\u201d too \u201climited\u201d in de-\ntail and numerosity. Pet.App.51. \nPlaintiffs understandably did not anticipate this \nnew evidentiary distinction (the district court cer-\ntainly did not). Moreover, the Second Circuit did not \ncite any precedent for this position, and it is by all ap-\npearances a newly articulated distinction. Nor did the \nKaplan II decision mention any distinction between \n\u201cpublicly available evidence\u201d and \u201cpublic sources\u201d of \nevidence. In fact, \u201cpublicly available evidence\u201d echoes \nthe term the Second Circuit had previously used as a \nbasis for inferring knowledge, relying on this Court\u2019s \nprecedent: \u201cPublicly available information may pro-\nvide relevant circumstantial evidence of actual \nknowledge.\u201d Fed. Hous. Fin. Agency v. Nomura Hold-\ning Am., Inc., 873 F.3d 85, 122 (2d Cir. 2017) (empha-\nsis added) (citing Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa, 539 U.S. \n90, 100 (2003)). Indeed, it seems reasonable that \nbanks, given their unique Know-Your-Customer obli-\ngations and due diligence policies, which assume close \nmonitoring of customer accounts and transactions, \nwould know facts about their customers \u201cbefore the \nnews media\u201d report it (which involves deciding what is \nnewsworthy and what facts are verifiable).  \nBut no matter\u2014Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed amended com-\nplaint included numerous and detailed allegations of \ncontemporaneous \u201cpublic sources\u201d to meet the Second \nCircuit\u2019s requirement.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n19 \n \nThe other defects the circuit identified were also re-\nmediable. For example, the circuit discounted Plain-\ntiffs\u2019 assertion that BLOM must have noticed that the \nThree Customers were receiving funds from desig-\nnated terrorist entities. The circuit noted that the com-\nplaint alleged that Sanabil received transfers from the \n\u201cAl-Aqsa Foundation\u201d after Israel designated it as a \nterrorist organization, but not \u201cwhether and where \nthis [designation] was made public.\u201d Pet.App.52 n.20. \nThe circuit also noted that the complaint needed \u201cfur-\nther allegations\u201d to show that a defendant-bank would \nknow about \u201ctransfers of funds from non-customers as-\nsociated with an FTO to the defendant\u2019s customers.\u201d \nId.  \nThese defects were not due to unreasonable draft-\ning\u2014previous ATA decisions found it reasonable to in-\nfer that a foreign bank would \u201cmonitor publicly avail-\nable information,\u201d including \u201cIsraeli lists of terrorists.\u201d \nWeiss v. Nat\u2019l Westminster Bank PLC, 453 F. Supp. \n2d 609, 627 (E.D.N.Y. 2006) (emphasis added). But the \nproposed amended complaint now includes media re-\nports on the relevant Israeli designations and BLOM\u2019s \nown customer due diligence procedures, such as moni-\ntoring transfer counterparties and non-profit organi-\nzations, which are often used as terror fronts.  \nSimilarly, although Plaintiffs repeatedly empha-\nsized the suspicious nature of Sanabil making large \ncash withdrawals from its BLOM account, the circuit \nsuggesting that the complaint should more explicitly \nallege that cash is \u201cuntraceable.\u201d Pet.App.51 n.19. Alt-\nhough Plaintiffs took that characteristic of cash to be \na reasonable inference rather than a necessary allega-\ntion, they included those explicit allegations in the \nproposed amended complaint. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n20 \n \nV. \nPlaintiffs\u2019 Motion to Vacate and Amend and \nthe Second Appeal \nAs the Second Circuit explained in the summary \norder below, the district court had applied the \u201cwrong \nlegal standards\u201d in dismissing the complaint, so once \n\u201c[a]rmed with this Court\u2019s clarifications, Plaintiffs re-\nturned to the district court,\u201d promptly moving (11 days \nafter Honickman II issued\u2014in fact, before the man-\ndate issued) under Rules 60(b)(6) and 15(a)(2) to va-\ncate the judgment of dismissal and grant them leave \nto file a first amended complaint. JA.315. The district \ncourt denied the motion, concluding that Plaintiffs \nfailed to show extraordinary circumstances chiefly be-\ncause they declined the district court\u2019s two prior invi-\ntations to meet the erroneous and largely impossible \npleading standard BLOM urged and that the district \ncourt erroneously adopted.  \nPlaintiffs again appealed. During argument, Cir-\ncuit Court Judge Wesley\u2014who also authored Honick-\nman II\u2014noted the case constituted an \u201cunusual cir-\ncumstance,\u201d 10/5/2023 Oral Arg. at 3:40, and \u201ca curi-\nous situation,\u201d id. at 10:54, and was \u201cquirky,\u201d id. at \n18:07. And as he recognized, Plaintiffs faced \u201ca wrong \nstandard\u201d \u201cthat\u2019s even harder for them to meet.\u201d Judge \nWesley observed: \u201cWhat are they supposed to do? They \nknow they can\u2019t amend [to] . . . meet that\u201d standard. \nId. at 11:50-56. The dismissal was \u201c[a]ffirmed for a dif-\nferent reason,\u201d as a result of a series of cases \u201cwhere \nthe law was really recasting itself.\u201d Id. at 13:12-38. \nAfter that oral argument in this case, the Second \nCircuit decided Mandala, another \u201cone of the excep-\ntional cases necessitating relief from judgment.\u201d Man-\ndala, 88 F.4th at 365. In Mandala, the plaintiffs \nbrought a putative class action alleging that defendant \nNTT Data\u2019s policy of not hiring people with felony \n\n \n \n \n \n \n21 \n \nconvictions disproportionately harms Black appli-\ncants. See id. at 357. The plaintiffs cited government \nreports showing \u201cBlack people are arrested and incar-\ncerated at higher rates than others.\u201d Id. The district \ncourt dismissed the complaint because it did not show \nthat there was a similar disparity among Black appli-\ncants for NTT\u2019s positions specifically.  \nThe Second Circuit affirmed, \u201cagree[ing] with the \ndistrict court\u201d that the complaint\u2019s statistics did not \nfocus on \u201cappropriate comparator groups.\u201d Id. at 357-\n58 (citation omitted). However, the circuit recognized \n\u201cthat such granular data may be impossible to collect \nwithout discovery,\u201d and that \u201cthe Complaint might \nhave survived dismissal if it had contained allegations \nexplaining \u2018why their chosen national statistics are in \nfact likely to be representative of NTT\u2019s qualified ap-\nplicant pool.\u2019\u201d Id. at 358 (citation omitted). The plain-\ntiffs petitioned for rehearing en banc, and although it \nwas denied, the dissenting judges urged the plaintiffs \nto move for vacatur and leave to amend. The plaintiffs \ndid, and the district court denied the motion.  \nOn appeal, the second Mandala panel acknowl-\nedged that \u201c[i]t wasn\u2019t until this Court\u2019s decision on \nappeal that it became clear what other types of infor-\nmation might suffice at the pleading stage.\u201d Id. at 365. \nAs a result, the panel vacated that denial and re-\nmanded the motion for reconsideration given Foman, \nthe Second Circuit cases Metzler and Williams, and \nother precedents.  \nRecognizing that its \u201cdiscussion of the various con-\nsiderations in Mandala will be particularly helpful to \nthe district court\u2019s analysis\u201d of Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for \nvacatur and leave to amend, the Second Circuit issued \nthe summary order below, likewise citing Foman and \nMetzler. Pet.App.1-8. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n22 \n \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n1. Second Circuit precedent does not meaningfully \ndiffer from other circuits\u2019 post-judgment amendment \nholdings. The summary order below does not \u201chold\u201d \nanything, and the precedents it cites are typical of \nRule 60(b)(6) cases. For example, they uncontrover-\nsially hold that \u201c[r]elief under Rule 60(b)(6) is reserved \nfor cases that present \u2018extraordinary circumstances.\u2019\u201d \nMandala, 88 F.4th at 361 (quoting Liljeberg v. Health \nServs. Acquisition Corp., 486 U.S. 847, 863 (1988)).  \nThis case involves highly exceptional circum-\nstances. The district court applied erroneous stand-\nards for pleading aiding and abetting under JASTA, \nincluding a knowledge pleading standard that was all \nbut impossible to meet. Pet.App.5, 49. Plaintiffs rea-\nsonably declined the district court\u2019s invitation to \namend to meet those erroneous standards. The Second \nCircuit \u201cagree[d]\u201d that those standards were incorrect, \nbut found the complaint did not meet the standards it \n\u201cclarified\u201d on appeal. Pet.App.25, 40 n.11. After the \ndistrict court refused to let Plaintiffs amend their com-\nplaint to meet the clarified standard, the Second Cir-\ncuit directed it to reconsider, given prior precedents. It \ndid not dictate a particular outcome.  \n2. The balancing test the circuit court described is \nalso typical of Rule 60(b)(6) cases. The Second Circuit \nrejects allowing the \u201cliberal amendment policy of Rule \n15(a) to swallow the philosophy favoring finality of \njudgments whole.\u201d Metzler, 970 F.3d at 146 (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted). Rather, the \ntest balances Rule 60(b)\u2019s value of finality \u201cwith the \npreference expressed in the Federal Rules of Civil Pro-\ncedure in general, and Rule 15 in particular, for resolv-\ning disputes on their merits.\u201d Krupski, 560 U.S. at \n550. After all, \u201cthe \u2018whole purpose\u2019 of Rule 60(b) \u2018is to \n\n \n \n \n \n \n23 \n \nmake an exception to finality.\u2019\u201d Buck v. Davis, 580 U.S. \n100, 126 (2017) (citations omitted). \nThe practical effect of that balance is far more mod-\nest than BLOM suggests: \u201cIn the post-judgment con-\ntext, we have indeed given \u2018due regard\u2019 to \u2018the liberal \nspirit of Rule 15\u2019 by ensuring plaintiffs at least one op-\nportunity to replead.\u201d Metzler, 970 F.3d at 146 (quot-\ning Williams, 659 F.3d at 213-14). See also Mandala, \n88 F.4th at 362 (same). Courts regularly recognize the \nimportance of providing plaintiffs an opportunity to \namend their complaints once apprised of actual defects \nin them. Where the dismissal standards are wrong, \nhowever, \u201cthe proper recourse\u201d is an appeal, United \nStates v. Mask of Ka-Nefer-Nefer, 752 F.3d 737, 743 \n(8th Cir. 2014), which Plaintiffs here took. None of \nBLOM\u2019s cited cases suggest that under the circum-\nstances present here Plaintiffs would not be entitled to \namend. \n3. BLOM\u2019s appeal is premised on the unsupported \ninference that the Second Circuit agreed that Plain-\ntiffs \u201cwaived\u201d their opportunities to amend but then \n\u201cdirected district courts to override and rescue parties \nfrom their \u2018free, calculated, [and] deliberate choices.\u2019\u201d \nPet.Br.28-29. But the Second Circuit did not find any \nwaiver. Quite the opposite, it suggested Plaintiffs rea-\nsonably appealed the district court\u2019s dismissal deci-\nsion and never received a meaningful opportunity to \nmeet the correct and newly clarified standards\u2014and \nthus had nothing to waive.  \nBLOM\u2019s litany of \u201cwaived\u201d opportunities to amend \nare not supported by the record and in any event were \nnot accepted by the panel below in discussing post-\njudgment amendment standards. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n24 \n \n4. The Second Circuit\u2019s precedents do not conflict \nwith the text of Rule 60(b) or Rule 15(a). The Second \nCircuit requires determining which Rule 60(b) provi-\nsion applies as a \u201cthreshold issue,\u201d before considering \namendment. Mandala, 88 F.4th at 359. The desire to \namend a complaint itself is insufficient. \n5. Extraordinary circumstances are clearly present \nhere, for the reasons stated above. Plaintiffs were not \nafforded a meaningful opportunity to address actual \ndefects in their complaint. They properly appealed the \ndistrict court\u2019s erroneous decision and then promptly \nsought vacatur to meet the clarified standards the cir-\ncuit issued on appeal. Discovery has not even com-\nmenced\u2014this case is in its infancy, and Plaintiffs \nshould have the opportunity to have their case adjudi-\ncated on the merits. \nARGUMENT  \nI. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s Analysis Is Consistent \nwith Post-Judgment Amendment Jurispru-\ndence Nationally. \nBLOM asserts that the summary order below \n\u201cabandons the \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 standard \nin favor of a nebulous \u2018balanc[ing]\u2019 inquiry that pits \nRule 60(b)(6)\u2019s protection of \u2018finality\u2019 against \u2018Rule \n15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policies.\u2019\u201d Pet.Br.25 (quot-\ning Pet.App.8). This is inaccurate.  \nFirst, as Respondent acknowledges, the decision \nbelow is a non-precedential summary order which \nmerely \u201c[r]el[ies] on a series of Second Circuit prece-\ndents.\u201d Pet.Br.20. In fact, the order only cites three de-\ncisions on post-judgment amendment\u2014Mandala and \nMetzler from the Second Circuit, and Foman v. Davis, \n371 U.S. 178 (1962), from this Court.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n25 \n \nSecond, these decisions are not erroneous and cer-\ntainly do not \u201cjettison\u201d the extraordinary circum-\nstances standard, as BLOM claims. Pet.Br.14. Man-\ndala holds that \u201c[r]elief under Rule 60(b)(6) is reserved \nfor cases that present \u2018extraordinary circumstances.\u2019\u201d \n88 F.4th at 361 (quoting Liljeberg, 486 U.S. at 863). \nAnd in Metzler, the Second Circuit affirmed denial of \npost-judgment amendment because \u201cthe plaintiffs-ap-\npellants fail[ed] to identify any \u2018extraordinary circum-\nstances\u2019 that would \u2018justify[] relief\u2019 under Rule \n60(b)(6).\u201d 970 F.3d at 147. \nAs explained below, the \u201cextraordinary circum-\nstances\u201d here are clear. This case is, as Judge Wesley \nput it, \u201cunusual,\u201d \u201cquirky,\u201d and \u201ccurious,\u201d appearing to \ndeny Plaintiffs even a single meaningful opportunity \nto amend. The Second Circuit therefore directed the \ndistrict court to reconsider its denial of vacatur given \nthe standards in Mandala and Metzler. As this re-\nmand reflected, Rule 60(b)(6) motions inherently re-\nquire \u201ccase-by-case inquiry,\u201d Stokes v. Williams, 475 \nF.3d 732, 736 (6th Cir. 2007)). Indeed, even if this \nCourt wanted to revisit its jurisprudence on Rule \n60(b), it is difficult to imagine it being able to fashion \nany generally applicable standard based on the \u201cunu-\nsual\u201d procedural history of this case. \nA. Rule 60(b)(6) Jurisprudence Balances Fi-\nnality and the Preference for Deciding \nCases on Their Merits. \nMandala and Metzler both apply the balancing test \narticulated in Williams v. Citigroup: \u201cpostjudgment \nmotions for leave to replead must be evaluated with \ndue regard to both the value of finality and the policies \nembodied in Rule 15.\u201d 659 F.3d at 213. Finality thus \nremains the starting point for applying Rule 60(b)(6) \nin the Second Circuit: \u201c[t]he standards we have \n\n \n \n \n \n \n26 \n \ndeveloped for evaluating postjudgment motions gener-\nally place significant emphasis on the \u2018value of finality \nand repose.\u2019\u201d Id. (citation omitted). The circuit notes \nthat \u2018\u201c[t]o hold otherwise would enable the liberal \namendment policy of Rule 15(a) to be employed in a \nway that is contrary to the philosophy favoring finality \nof judgments and the expeditious termination of liti-\ngation.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Nat\u2019l Petrochemical Co. v. M/T \nStolt Sheaf, 930 F.2d 240, 245 (2d Cir. 1991)). \nFinality is then balanced with Rule 15(a)\u2019s prefer-\nence for resolving cases on their merits, which the Wil-\nliams panel sourced from this Court\u2019s \u201c[p]articularly \ninstructive\u201d Foman decision. 695 F.3d at 213. Foman \nheld that the district court abused its discretion in \ndenying a motion to vacate the judgment in order to \namend the complaint:  \nRule 15(a) declares that leave to amend \u201cshall \nbe freely given when justice so requires\u201d; this \nmandate is to be heeded. See generally, 3 \nMoore, Federal Practice (2d ed. 1948), paras. \n15.08, 15.10. If the underlying facts or circum-\nstances relied upon by a plaintiff may be a \nproper subject of relief, he ought to be afforded \nan opportunity to test his claim on the mer-\nits. In the absence of any apparent or declared \nreason \u2014 such as undue delay, bad faith or di-\nlatory motive on the part of the movant, re-\npeated failure to cure deficiencies by amend-\nments previously allowed, undue prejudice to \nthe opposing party by virtue of allowance of the \namendment, futility of amendment, etc. \u2014 the \nleave sought should, as the rules require, be \n\u201cfreely given.\u201d Of course, the grant or denial of \nan opportunity to amend is within the discre-\ntion of the District Court, but outright refusal to \n\n \n \n \n \n \n27 \n \ngrant the leave without any justifying reason \nappearing for the denial is not an exercise of dis-\ncretion; it is merely abuse of that discretion and \ninconsistent with the spirit of the Federal \nRules. \n371 U.S. at 182.3 See, e.g., United States v. Vorachek, \n563 F.2d 884, 887 (8th Cir. 1977) (vacatur necessary \ngiven Foman and Rule 15(a)).  \nThis Court has always balanced the finality of judg-\nments with the preference for giving plaintiffs \u201can op-\nportunity to test their claims on the merits.\u201d For ex-\nample, this Court \u201cbalance[d] the interests of the de-\nfendant protected by the statute of limitations with \nthe preference expressed in the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure in general, and Rule 15 in particular, for re-\nsolving disputes on their merits.\u201d Krupski, 560 U.S. at \n550. A statute of limitations embodies the value of fi-\nnality and repose, see, e.g., Lozano v. Alvarez, 572 U.S. \n1, 14 (2014), just as, in the Second Circuit, \u201cpostjudg-\nment motions generally place significant emphasis on \n \n3  \nBLOM argues that the circuit erred in relying on Foman \nbecause the vacatur motion in that case was treated as coming \nunder Rule 59(e), not Rule 60(b), and the two rules \u201cdiffer in ma-\nterial ways and impose different standards for relief by their own \nterms.\u201d Pet.Br.18, 34-35. As explained infra 31-32, any such dis-\ntinction does not help BLOM\u2014but it was also completely irrele-\nvant to this Court\u2019s analysis in Foman. The First Circuit had de-\ncided to treat the motion as \u201cfiled pursuant to Rule 59(e), rather \nthan under Rule 60(b)\u201d to resolve an unrelated procedural issue \ninvolving two notices of appeal. Foman v. Davis, 292 F.2d 85, 87 \n(1st Cir. 1961). This Court then noted that the \u201cCourt of Appeals\u2019 \ntreatment of the motion to vacate as one under Rule 59(e) was \npermissible, at least as an original matter, and we will accept \nthat characterization here.\u201d 371 U.S. at 181. It never suggested \nthat the \u201ccharacterization\u201d impacted its review or the vacatur \nstandards it applied.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n28 \n \nthe \u2018value of finality and repose,\u2019\u201d Williams, 659 F.3d \nat 213 (internal citation omitted).  \nThis Court has also always understood Rule 60(b) \nas accommodating that preference, rejecting argu-\nments that overemphasize finality at its expense. For \nexample: \u201c[T]he State reminds us of the importance of \npreserving the finality of judgments. But the \u2018whole \npurpose\u2019 of Rule 60(b) \u2018is to make an exception to final-\nity.\u2019\u201d Buck, 580 U.S. at 126 (citations omitted). BLOM \nrelies heavily on this Court\u2019s analysis of finality in \nGonzalez v. Crosby but omits its conclusion: \u201c[W]e give \nlittle weight to respondent\u2019s appeal to the virtues of \nfinality. That policy consideration, standing alone, is \nunpersuasive in the interpretation of a provision \nwhose whole purpose is to make an exception to final-\nity.\u201d 545 U.S. 524, 529 (2005). Likewise, BLOM quotes \nthis Court\u2019s admonition in United States v. Denedo \nthat \u201cjudgment finality is not to be lightly cast aside,\u201d \nPet.Br.27, but again leaves out the Court\u2019s conclusion: \n\u201cthe finality rule is not so inflexible that it trumps each \nand every competing consideration.\u201d 556 U.S. 904, 916 \n(2009). A \u201cjudgment\u201d based on the wrong reasons, due \nlargely to what the circuit itself concedes to have been \nits own \u201cambigu[ous]\u201d precedent, Pet.App.40 n.11, is \nto be \u201ccast aside\u201d in order to permit disposition on the \nmerits.  \nLike this Court, the Second Circuit rejects \u201ca stand-\nard that overemphasize[s] considerations of finality at \nthe expense of the liberal amendment policy embodied \nin the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\u201d Williams, 659 \nF.3d at 210. And like this Court, the Second Circuit \nholds that \u201cRule 60(b) relief is designed to afford par-\nties an opportunity to resolve a dispute on its merits.\u201d \nNemaizer v. Baker, 793 F.2d 58, 63 (2d Cir. 1986) (cit-\ning 7 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, \u00b6 60.19, at 156 (2d ed. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n29 \n \n1983)). That is, the policies underlying Rules 60(b) and \n15(a) work \u201cin tandem,\u201d as the Second Circuit ex-\nplained below. Pet.App.7. \nThe circuit courts have also consistently recognized \nthis balance inherent in Rule 60(b)(6). The rule\u2019s \u201c[ex-\ntraordinary circumstances] requirement exists in or-\nder to balance the broad language of Rule 60(b)(6), \nwhich allows courts to set aside judgments for \u2018any\u2019 \nreason justifying relief, with the interest in the finality \nof judgments.\u201d Budget Blinds, 536 F.3d at 255. The \nNinth Circuit sourced this principle to Gonzalez:  \nAs the Sixth Circuit rightly held when applying \nGonzalez, \u201cthe decision to grant Rule 60(b)(6) \nrelief is a case-by-case inquiry that requires the \ntrial court to intensively balance numerous fac-\ntors, including the competing policies of the fi-\nnality of judgments and the incessant command \nof the court\u2019s conscience that justice be done in \nlight of all the facts.\u201d  \nPhelps v. Alameida, 569 F.3d 1120, 1133 (9th Cir. \n2009) (quoting Stokes, 475 F.3d at 736). See also In re \nSpansion, Inc., 507 F.

Miller & M.K. \nKane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2851 (2d ed. \n1995) (same). \nThe Eighth Circuit has held that district courts re-\nviewing post-judgment motions to amend under Rule \n59(e) or Rule 60(b) \u2018\u201cmay not ignore the Rule 15(a)(2) \nconsiderations that favor affording parties an oppor-\ntunity to test their claims on the merits . . . .\u2019\u201d Mask of \nKa-Nefer-Nefer, 752 F.3d at 743 (quoting United \nStates ex rel. Roop v. Hypoguard USA, Inc., 559 F.3d \n818, 823-24 (8th Cir. 2009)). Indeed, Moore\u2019s Federal \nPractice specifically notes that \u201c[t]he hybrid approach \nof the Second and Eighth Circuits strikes the correct \nbalance: it protects the strong interest in finality of \njudgments and the expeditious termination of litiga-\ntion, while allowing postjudgment amendment of \npleadings in a particular case if justice requires.\u201d 12 \nMoore\u2019s Federal Practice - Civil \u00a7 59.30. For that prop-\nosition, Moore\u2019s relies on two Rule 60(b)(6) cases\u2014Wil-\nliams and Mask of Ka-Nefer-Nefer. Id., \u00a7 59.30 n.9.1.3, \nn.9.1.4. \nThe Seventh Circuit gives even greater weight to \nRule 15 interests when the district court has entered \njudgment at the same time it dismisses a complaint: \nBecause Rules 59(e) and 60(b) are reserved for \nextraordinary cases, the Girl Scouts urge us to \napply a more demanding standard to post-judg-\nment motions to amend than we do to motions \nto amend filed prior to the entry of judgment. \n \n4  \nThe same is true for Rule 59(e), in which \u201c[t]he court must \nstrike the proper balance between two competing imperatives: (1) \nfinality, and (2) the need to render just decisions on the basis of \nall the facts.\u201d Edward H. Bohlin Co. v. Banning Co., 6 F.3d 350, \n355 (5th Cir. 1993). \n\n \n \n \n \n \n31 \n \nBut the extraordinary nature of these remedies \ndoes not mean that a different standard ap-\nplies\u2014at least when judgment was entered at \nthe same time the case was first dismissed. \nWhen the district court has taken the unusual \nstep of entering judgment at the same time it \ndismisses the complaint, the court need not find \nother extraordinary circumstances and must \nstill apply the liberal standard for amending \npleadings under Rule 15(a). \nRunnion v. Girl Scouts of Greater Chi. & Nw. Ind., 786 \nF.3d 510, 521 (7th Cir. 2015). See also NewSpin \nSports, Ltd. Liab. Co. v.

Maryland, 97 F.4th 166 (4th \nCir. 2024). Pet.Br.34-35. But Daulatzai only held that \nunder Rule 59(e), a court should solely \u201capply the more \nspecific standard of Rule 15(a),\u201d and \u201cneed not concern \nitself\u201d with Rule 59(e)\u2019s other standards. 97 F.4th at \n177 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \nSee also Rosenzweig v. Azurix Corp., 332 F.3d 854, 864 \n(5th Cir. 2003) (\u201cthis Court has held that, under these \ncircumstances, the considerations for a Rule 59(e) mo-\ntion are governed by Rule 15(a)\u201d); Jang v.

Walmart Stores, L.L.C., 907 F.3d 170, \n184 (5th Cir. 2018) (same).5 Daulatzai unremarkably \n \n5  \nBLOM relies heavily on Banister v. Davis, 590 U.S. 504 \n(2020), but that case deals with what types of vacatur motions \ncount as a successive habeas application. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n32 \n \nheld that \u201cto obtain relief from a final judgment under \nRule 60(b), one of the six grounds enumerated must be \nsatisfied,\u201d including finding \u201cextraordinary circum-\nstances\u201d under Rule 60(b)(6). 97 F.4th at 178. The \nplaintiff failed to show \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d \nthere because she had already amended twice, and her \namendment \u201cefforts were pursued in bad faith.\u201d Id. at \n170. The extraordinary circumstances requirement is \nthe same in Metzler and Mandala (and in Runnion, \nwhich did find \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d).  \nIn sum, BLOM\u2019s claim that \u201cevery one of [the Sec-\nond Circuit\u2019s] sister Circuits\u201d disagrees with it is \nsimply wrong. Pet.Br.25. A number of BLOM\u2019s own \ncases recognize the need to balance competing policies \nin Rule 60(b). For example, in Leisure Caviar, LLC v. \nUnited States Fish & Wildlife Service, the Sixth Cir-\ncuit explained that while amendment should be \u201cfreely \nallowed,\u201d \u201cwhen a Rule 15 motion comes after a judg-\nment against the plaintiff,\u201d courts \u201cmust \u2018consider[] \nthe competing interest of protecting the finality of \njudgments\u201d; that is, \u201c[i]nstead of meeting only the \nmodest requirements of Rule 15, the claimant must \nmeet the requirements for reopening a case estab-\nlished by Rules 59 or 60.\u201d 616 F.3d 612, 615-16 (6th \nCir. 2010) (citations omitted) (emphases added). Like \nin Phelps, Leisure Caviar directs courts to balance the \n\u201ccompeting\u201d policies of Rule 15 and Rule 60.  \nAnd in Nation v. DOI, the Ninth Circuit explained \nthat \u201c[a]fter judgment . . . \u2018our policy of promoting the \nfinality of judgments\u2019 somewhat displaces Rule 15\u2019s \nopenhandedness,\u201d given Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s predicate of \nextraordinary circumstances. 876 F.3d 1144, 1173 (9th \nCir. 2017) (citation omitted) (emphasis added). That \ncase affirmed denial of post-judgment leave to amend \nbecause the plaintiff had already twice amended and \n\n \n \n \n \n \n33 \n \nfailed to identify how yet another amendment could \ncure its standing problem.  \nMost of BLOM\u2019s remaining cases simply note that \na judgment must be appealed or vacated before a com-\nplaint is amended or that Rule 15(a) does not alone \nprovide the analytical basis for vacatur\u2014but none dis-\npute that the Rule 15 principles could inform the ex-\nceptional circumstances analysis. See Rosenzweig, 332 \nF.3d at 864 (explaining that post-judgment amend-\nment requires appeal or vacatur); In re Ferro Corp. \nDerivative Litig., 511 F.3d 611, 624 (6th Cir. 2008) \n(same); Helm v. Resolution Tr. Corp., 84 F.3d 874, 879 \n(7th Cir. 1996) (same); Bldg. Indus. Ass\u2019n v. Norton, \n247 F.3d 1241, 1245 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (same); Boyd v. \nSecretary, 114 F.4th 1232, 1237 (11th Cir. 2024) \n(same). Indeed, in a case BLOM cites for the proposi-\ntion that \u201cthere is no pending complaint to amend\u201d \nonce \u201cthe action has been dismissed\u201d with prejudice, \nthe opinion noted that courts still apply \u201cRule 15 \nstandards\u201d to such vacatur motions. Calvary Christian \nCenter v. City of Fredericksburg, 710 F.3d 536, 540 \n(4th Cir. 2013). \nTo the extent that any of BLOM\u2019s cases can be read \nto suggest that Rule 15(a)\u2019s preference for determining \ncases on their merits plays no role in motions for post-\njudgment amendment, they are out of step with the \nother circuits. BLOM quotes Garrett v. Wexford \nHealth as holding that under Rule 60(b), \u201c[t]he permis-\nsive policy favoring amendment under Rule 15 was \nsimply not relevant.\u201d 938 F.3d 69, 86 (3d Cir. 2019). \nBut that case cited and relied on Leisure Caviar, 616 \nF.3d at 615-16, which requires courts to weigh the \n\u201ccompeting interests\u201d of Rules 15 and 60. The starker \nlanguage in Garrett was understandable as the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n34 \n \nplaintiff had already amended his complaint four \ntimes, clearly exhausting the policy of liberal amend-\nment.  \nUnsurprisingly, BLOM has selected cases where \nplaintiffs have thoroughly exhausted any chance to \namend. As noted above, Daulatzai involved a motion \nto file a fourth complaint, \u201cpursued in bad faith.\u201d 97 \nF.4th at 170. In James v. Watt, 716 F.2d 71, 77 (1st \nCir. 1983), the delay in amendment was \u201cstrategic.\u201d In \nIn re Ferro, the plaintiff did not have an actual amend-\nment in mind and needed discovery. 511 F.3d at 624. \nSee also Helm, 84 F.3d at 879 (\u201cinexcusable attorney \nnegligence\u201d); UMB Bank, N.A. v. Guerin, 89 F.4th \n1047, 1057-58 (8th Cir. 2024) (proposed second \namended complaint \u201crepeats . . . scandalous, logically \nirrelevant material\u201d and was futile) (internal quota-\ntion marks and citations omitted); Nation, 876 F.3d at \n1174 (plaintiff \u201camended its complaint twice before\u201d \ndismissal).  \nB. Rule 60(b)\u2019s Balancing Means Ensuring \nParties Have a Meaningful Opportunity \nto Amend Pleadings at Least Once, \nWhich Courts Broadly Support. \nIn the Second Circuit, the practical effect of the bal-\nancing inquiry for post-judgment motions to amend is \nfar less dramatic than BLOM suggests: \u201cIn the post-\njudgment context, we have indeed given \u2018due regard\u2019 \nto \u2018the liberal spirit of Rule 15\u2019 by ensuring plaintiffs \nat least one opportunity to replead.\u201d Metzler, 970 F.3d \nat 146 (quoting Williams, 659 F.3d at 213-14). See also \nMandala, 88 F.4th at 362 (same). If the plaintiff has \nhad a meaningful chance to amend, dismissal is no \nlonger extraordinary:  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n35 \n \nIn most if not all Second Circuit cases denying \npost-judgment leave to replead, the plaintiff \nhad already taken at least one shot at amend-\nment. This makes sense: when a plaintiff al-\nready had multiple chances to state a claim, \nthere is little risk of manifest injustice in deny-\ning yet another go. \nId. (citations omitted). \nBut a chance to state a claim is only meaningful if \nthe claimant has been fairly instructed in the correct \nlegal standard, either by a ruling of the district court \nor by clear precedent. Such a ruling identifies actual \nand remediable defects in the complaint, if any. See, \ne.g., United States ex rel. Customs Fraud Investiga-\ntions, LLC v. Victaulic Co., 839 F.3d 242, 250 (3d Cir. \n2016) (observing that without a ruling, \u201ca plaintiff is \nunlikely to know whether his complaint is actually de-\nficient\u2014and in need of revision\u201d); Tate v. SCR Med. \nTransp., 809 F.3d 343, 346 (7th Cir. 2015) (\u201cthe court \nshould grant leave to amend after dismissal of the first \ncomplaint \u2018unless it is certain from the face of the com-\nplaint that any amendment would be futile or other-\nwise unwarranted\u2019\u201d) (citation omitted); United States \nex rel. Lee v. Corinthian Colls., 655 F.3d 984, 998 (9th \nCir. 2011) (\u201c[plaintiffs] should have at least one oppor-\ntunity to add any such facts to the Complaint\u201d); Fire-\nstone v. Firestone, 76 F.3d 1205, 1208 (D.C. Cir. 1996) \n(similar). The Second Circuit noted that it is an \u201cim-\npropriety\u201d to deny amendment \u201cwithout the benefit of \na ruling,\u201d as that presents plaintiffs with a \u201cHobson\u2019s \nchoice: agree to cure deficiencies not yet fully briefed \nand decided or forfeit the opportunity to replead.\u201d Lo-\nreley Fin. (Jersey) No. 3 Ltd. v. Wells Fargo Sec., LLC, \n797 F.3d 160, 190 (2d Cir. 2015). \n\n \n \n \n \n \n36 \n \nOrdinarily, entering judgment dismissing a case \nwithout the opportunity to amend is an abuse of dis-\ncretion. See supra 30-31 (quoting Runnion, 786 F.3d at \n521). See also Jack v. Evonik Corp., 79 F.4th 547, 565 \n(5th Cir. 2023) (\u201cPlaintiffs should usually be able to \namend at least once, because \u2018fairness requires\u2019 it.\u201d) \n(citation omitted). In such case, \u201c[t]he district court left \nthe plaintiff with little recourse but to file a motion \nunder Rules 59(e) and 60(b) . . . .\u201d Foster v. DeLuca, \n545 F.3d 582, 584 (7th Cir. 2008).  \nIn fact, Plaintiffs\u2019 motion here would have come un-\nder Rule 59(e), which BLOM\u2019s cases suggest are eval-\nuated under Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal standards only, see \nsupra 31-32\u2014if not for the necessity of appealing the \ndistrict court\u2019s erroneous and essentially impossible \npleading standards first. See Mask of Ka-Nefer-Nefer, \n752 F.3d at 743 (explaining that appealing is \u201cthe \nproper recourse\u201d where a dismissal decision is wrong). \nAs the Seventh Circuit explained, \u201ca plaintiff who re-\nceives a Rule 12(b)(6) motion and who has good reason \nto think the complaint is sufficient may also choose to \nstand on the complaint and insist on a decision with-\nout losing the benefit of the well-established liberal \nstandard for amendment with leave of court under \nRule 15(a)(2).\u201d Runnion, 786 F.3d at 523. \nOf course, that entailed a risk\u2014Plaintiffs could \nhave been wrong on appeal. If the Second Circuit had \naffirmed the district court\u2019s reasoning (and not just \noutcome), that would not be an \u201cexceptional circum-\nstance\u201d\u2014that happens routinely and when it does, a \nplaintiff may have made a \u201cfree, calculated, [and] de-\nliberate choice\u201d not to take advantage of any prior op-\nportunities to amend. The circuit\u2019s affirmance on other \ngrounds here was thus fortuitous for BLOM\u2014but that \n\n \n \n \n \n \n37 \n \ndoes not justify elevating finality over the interests of \njustice. \nThis is why BLOM is compelled to argue that the \nSecond Circuit really affirmed dismissal of the case on \nthe same \u201cgrounds\u201d the district court used. Pet.Br.40. \nBut the district court acknowledged its dismissal was \nonly affirmed \u201con other grounds.\u201d Pet.App.10. The Sec-\nond Circuit\u2019s ground for affirmance involved one of the \nsame elements (knowledge), but for a fundamentally \ndifferent reason: the (original and still only) complaint \nrelied too much on \u201cpublicly available evidence\u201d rather \nthan \u201cpublic sources\u201d of information identifying \nBLOM\u2019s customers as Hamas-affiliated entities, and \nits allegation of the latter was too \u201climited.\u201d \nPet.App.51. \nThat the pleading standard was clarified on appeal \nis grounds to permit amendment, not deny it. For ex-\nample, in Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., \nthis Court explained that \u201c[w]hile we reject the Sev-\nenth Circuit\u2019s approach . . . we do not decide whether, \nunder the standard we have described . . . the Share-\nholders\u2019 allegations\u201d are sufficient. Because the lower \ncourts lacked \u201cthe opportunity to consider the matter \nin light of the prescriptions we announce today,\u201d the \nCourt vacated judgment \u201cso that the case may be reex-\namined in accord with our construction . . . .\u201d 551 U.S. \n308, 329 (2007). And after clarifying the Rule 8 plead-\ning standard in Ashcroft v. Iqbal, this Court ordered \nthat \u201c[t]he Court of Appeals should decide in the first \ninstance whether to remand to the District Court so \nthat respondent can seek leave to amend his deficient \ncomplaint.\u201d 556 U.S. 662, 687 (2009). See also Johnson \nv. City of Shelby, 574 U.S. 10, 12 (2014) (reversing dis-\nmissal with instructions to permit amendment if nec-\nessary). See also Marranzano v. Riggs Nat\u2019l Bank, 184 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n38 \n \nF.2d 349, 351 (D.C. Cir. 1950) (where a decision is \u201caf-\nfirmed\u201d but \u201cbased on an incorrect ground,\u201d the \u201cends \nof justice\u201d require \u201can opportunity to amend [the] com-\nplaint\u201d); Oil, Chem. & Atomic Workers Int\u2019l Union v. \nDelta Ref. Co., 277 F.2d 694, 697 (6th Cir. 1960) \n(where \u201cthe views which we have expressed give the \ncase a somewhat different aspect than it had under the \ntrial court\u2019s ruling,\u201d amendment is appropriate).  \nAfter the Second Circuit affirmed dismissal on \nother grounds in Honickman II, it left Plaintiffs the \nchoice of whether to move for post-judgment leave to \namend, if they thought they had the allegations to do \nso. But as is clear from the subsequent summary order \nbelow remanding the case for further consideration, \nthat affirmance was not intended to preclude Plain-\ntiffs from seeking an opportunity to amend.  \nII. \nThe Second Circuit Did Not Find Waiver, \nand Thus Did Not Alter the Vacatur Stand-\nard in Its Summary Order \nBLOM\u2019s argument hangs on the straw man that \nthe Second Circuit agreed that Plaintiffs \u201cconsistently \nand consciously rejected numerous invitations and op-\nportunities to amend,\u201d but nevertheless \u201cdirected dis-\ntrict courts to override and rescue parties from their \n\u2018free, calculated, [and] deliberate choices.\u2019\u201d Pet.Br.28-\n29 (citations omitted). Although BLOM pressed this \nargument to the circuit below, see BLOM Brief, No. 22-\n1039, Dkt. No. 42, at 1-2, 41-43, the circuit did not find \nany such waiver. To the contrary, it found that the dis-\ntrict court applied a \u201cwrong standard\u201d that was un-\nmeetable. As Judge Wesley asked BLOM\u2019s counsel \nduring the oral argument below, \u201cWhat are [Plaintiffs] \nsupposed to do? They know they can\u2019t amend [to] \n. . . meet\u201d the standard BLOM urged and the district \ncourt adopted. Notably, BLOM does not challenge the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n39 \n \nSecond Circuit\u2019s findings as to waiver in its question \npresented here. \nNevertheless, BLOM attempts to muster evidence \nof occasions when Plaintiffs forfeited opportunities to \namend. The first two \u201copportunities\u201d were the district \ncourt\u2019s invitations to amend before issuing its dismis-\nsal decision. But these opportunities were not mean-\ningful because they offered only to amend in conform-\nity with the incorrect legal standards BLOM urged, \ngiving Plaintiffs no notice of defects under the correct \nlegal standard. See, e.g., Bryant v. Dupree, 252 F.3d \n1161, 1164 (11th Cir. 2001) (\u201cit cannot be said that the \nplaintiffs failed to correct defects of which they had no-\ntice\u201d) (emphasis added). There is no forfeiture where \n\u201cDefendants did not [identify] below\u201d and \u201cthe district \ncourt itself did not rely on the deficiencies we have \nidentified in dismissing\u201d a plaintiff\u2019s claims\u2014espe-\ncially where \u201cthe district court\u2019s reasoning meant that \nno such amendments would remedy the defects that \nthe district court perceived.\u201d Charles Schwab Corp. v. \nBank of Am. Corp., 883 F.3d 68, 89-90 (2d Cir. 2018).  \nAgain, even the district court here acknowledged \nthat its dismissal decision was only affirmed \u201con other \ngrounds.\u201d Pet.App.10. BLOM notes that Plaintiffs \ncould have added some useful additional allegations in \ntheir proposed amended complaint before appealing, \nbut it would have been futile to do so given that Plain-\ntiffs would still have failed to meet each of the district \ncourt\u2019s (erroneous) standards.  \nIndeed, if declining these pre-judgment \u201copportuni-\nties\u201d to amend constituted waiver, litigants would be \ncompelled to file serial (futile) amendments and re-\nbrief Rule 12(b) motions simply to preserve their \nrights to amend post-appeal, which would hardly im-\nprove the efficiency of the lower federal courts or lead \n\n \n \n \n \n \n40 \n \nto more equitable outcomes. Likewise, a rule that dis-\nincentives bringing valid cases \u201cwhere the law [i]s re-\nally recasting itself\u201d in the circuit courts, as Judge \nWesley observed it was here, Oral Arg. at 13:23-38, \ndoes not promote the interests of justice. \nBLOM faults Plaintiffs for not moving for vacatur-\nfor-amendment instead of appealing, or not appealing \nthe with-prejudice nature of the dismissal. Pet.Br.11. \nPlaintiffs did not seek vacatur before appealing be-\ncause there is \u201cno reason\u201d to \u201cfile a post-judgment mo-\ntion seeking leave to amend\u201d where \u201cthe district \ncourt\u2019s reasoning meant that no such amendments \nwould remedy the defects that the district court per-\nceived.\u201d Charles Schwab, 883 F.3d at 90. Again, \u201cthe \nproper recourse when [a party] disagreed with the dis-\ntrict court\u2019s interpretation of the . . . statute was a di-\nrect appeal, not a Rule 60(b) motion.\u201d Mask of Ka-\nNefer-Nefer, 752 F.3d at 743. And Plaintiffs did not \nappeal the \u201cwith-prejudice\u201d component of the dismis-\nsal decision because leave to amend would not have \naltered the result without the circuit first correcting \nthe district court\u2019s legal errors.  \nFinally, BLOM also faults Plaintiffs for not asking \nthe circuit court for leave to amend in their post-argu-\nment supplemental brief in Honickman II. Pet.Br.11. \nThough asking the circuit for leave to amend is per-\nmissible, in the Second Circuit, post-judgment leave to \namend is generally a decision for the district court to \nmake \u201cin the first instance.\u201d Iqbal v. Ashcroft, 574 F.3d \n820, 822 (2d Cir. 2009).6 The circuit court\u2019s job is to \n \n6  \nBLOM also faults Plaintiffs for \u201cnot seek[ing] rehearing,\u201d \nPet.Br.12, but in the Mandala dissent BLOM relies on, Judge Sul-\nlivan criticized precisely that: \u201c[r]ather than seek vacatur and \nleave to amend\u201d after the first appeal, \u201cPlaintiffs instead opted to \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n41 \n \nassess the district court\u2019s ruling\u2014it goes without say-\ning that if a viable amendment is necessary, plaintiffs \nwill want to make it. The summary order demon-\nstrates that the circuit court did not find a need for \nPlaintiffs to have requested leave to amend from the \nfirst panel (Judge Wesley was on both unanimous pan-\nels). \nIII. \nThe Balancing Inquiry Does Not Conflict \nwith the Text of Any of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure. \nBLOM argues that the Second Circuit\u2019s precedent \nconflicts with the plain text of Rule 15(a) and Rule \n60(b). To do so, it erroneously construes the Second \nCircuit\u2019s basis for remand as \u201callow[ing] plaintiffs to \nleapfrog over \u2018Rule 60(b)\u2019s finality gauntlet\u2019 to the \nsanctuary of \u2018Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal repleading policy.\u2019\u201d \nPet.Br.30. Again, the Second Circuit directs district \ncourts to balance Rule 60(b)\u2019s finality and Rule 15(a)\u2019s \nliberality \u201cin tandem,\u201d Pet.App.7; it does not permit \n\u201cleapfrogging.\u201d See Meltzer, 970 F.3d at 146 (finding \nthe \u201cargument that the [post-judgment] motion is gov-\nerned solely by the legal standard applicable to Rule \n15(a)(2) motions . . . without merit.\u201d). \nTo establish a textual conflict, BLOM argues that \nRule 15(a) \u201capplies only to \u2018Amendments Before \nTrial,\u2019\u201d and \u201c[i]t is in that setting . . . that the Rules \nencourage courts to \u2018freely give leave\u2019 to amend.\u201d \nPet.Br.30. Thus, BLOM suggests, Rule 15\u2019s preference \n \nfile a petition for rehearing en banc\u2014a strategic choice that \nplainly undermines any argument that some aspect of the district \ncourt\u2019s order was an \u2018extraordinary circumstance\u2019 preventing \nPlaintiffs from pursuing their claims.\u201d 88 F.4th at 368. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n42 \n \nfor deciding cases on their merits is entirely extin-\nguished at judgment.  \nBut Rule 15 contemplates two stages of amend-\nment\u2014before trial and during or after trial. Both in-\nvolve \u201cfreely\u201d giving leave to amend, under certain cir-\ncumstances which depend on trial, not judgment. See \nRule 15(a)(2), Rule 15(b)(1). The rule has no higher \nstandard. \nIndeed, \n\u201c\u2018[a]mendments \nunder \n[Rule \n15(a)(2)] may be made at any stage of the litigation.\u2019 \nGranting leave to amend after summary judgment is \nthus allowed at the discretion of the trial court.\u201d Ngu-\nyen v. United States, 792 F.2d 1500, 1502 (9th Cir. \n1986) (quoting 6 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Prac-\ntice and Procedure \u00a7 1484 (1971)). See also Dussouy v. \nGulf Coast Inv. Corp., 660 F.2d 594, 598 (5th Cir. \n1981) (applying Rule 15 and noting that \u201c[i]nstances \nabound in which appellate courts on review have re-\nquired that leave to amend be granted after dismissal \nor entry of judgment\u201d). \nObviously, this case was not dismissed after trial\u2014\nit was dismissed following an initial Rule 12(b)(6) mo-\ntion, before Plaintiffs had the opportunity to try to \ncure any actual defects in their complaint. That is pre-\ncisely the context that Rule 15(a) squarely addresses. \nEntering judgment does not eliminate Rule 15(a)\u2019s \npreference for \u201cresolving disputes on their merits.\u201d \nKrupski, 560 U.S. at 550. \nBLOM argues that Rule 15(a) \u201cdoes not provide a \nmechanism for amending pleadings after dismissal,\u201d \nPet.Br.30, but that is likewise irrelevant. To the extent \nRule 60(b)(6) provides the \u201cmechanism,\u201d it is an \u201cex-\nception to finality\u201d for \u201cany reason that justifies relief.\u201d \nGranting leave to amend \u201cwhen justice so requires,\u201d as \nRule 15(a) commands, presumably informs the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n43 \n \nreasons that \u201cjustify relief\u201d under Rule 60(b)(6)\u2014in-\ncluding providing an opportunity to amend at least \nonce.7  \nBLOM asserts that the Second Circuit\u2019s \u201cbalancing \ntest\u201d conflicts with the rest of Rule 60(b) because it \nwould permit plaintiffs to \u201cevade those explicit time \nlimitations in\u201d Rule 60(b)(1) (relief given mistake or \nexcusable neglect) and Rule 60(b)(2) (relief given new \nevidence). Pet.Br.31-33. But the Second Circuit has \nnever suggested that vacatur and amendment are per-\nmissible where a complaint failed due to counsel\u2019s mis-\ntake or where a plaintiff simply wants to present new \nevidence over a year after judgment. Instead, a district \ncourt\u2019s failure to give plaintiffs at least one meaningful \nopportunity to replead may constitute extraordinary \ncircumstances, and vacatur and amendment may be \nappropriate.  \nIn Mandala, the Second Circuit determined which \nprovision of Rule 60(b) applied before turning to the \npolicies and standards of either Rule 60(b) or Rule \n15(a): \u201cProper characterization of Plaintiffs\u2019 Rule 60(b) \nmotion is a threshold issue because, as previously ex-\nplained, [Rule 60(b)\u2019s] provisions are subject to differ-\nent filing limitations . . . .\u201d 88 F.4th at 359. The Second \nCircuit determined that Rule 60(b)(6) was the proper \nrule because \u201cinsufficient pleading is not categorically \na \u2018mistake,\u2019 and Plaintiffs\u2019 belief that their Complaint \nsatisfied the standards for pleading a disparate impact \nclaim was well-founded, even if ultimately erroneous.\u201d \nId. \n \n7  \nBLOM contends that this Court should read Rule 60(b) \nwith Rule 1, not Rule 15(a). Pet.Br.35-38. But Rule 1 does not \nnegate Rule 15\u2014to the extent Rule 1 provides any guidance here, \nit is its command to secure the \u201cjust\u201d outcome. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n44 \n \nNor does the decision below conflict with Rule \n60(b)(2), which only permits vacatur to introduce (1) \nnewly discovered evidence (2) within a year of judg-\nment. The Second Circuit does not permit post-judg-\nment amendments \u201cbased on previously omitted alle-\ngations,\u201d as BLOM asserts (or evidence discovered \nover a year after judgment). Pet.Br.33. In fact, Metzler \nrejected an attempt to circumvent Rule 60(b)(2)\u2019s \n\u201cnewly discovered evidence standard.\u201d 970 F.3d at 146. \nThat case still required a showing of extraordinary cir-\ncumstances under Rule 60(b)(6). BLOM points out \nthat movants might introduce allegations they could \nhave presented before, Pet.Br.33, but Rule 60(b) gives \nreasons for vacating a judgment\u2014it does not limit \nwhat a party can include in an amended pleading once \nvacatur and leave to amend are granted. \nTo be clear, BLOM no longer appears to contest \nthat Rule 60(b)(6) applies in this case. The district \ncourt itself found that Rule 60(b)(6) applied here, not-\ning that \u201cnone of [the other provisions] are applicable\u201d \nto Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for vacatur. Pet.App.12. BLOM \ndid nevertheless argue to the panel below that Rule \n60(b)(1) applied, but the circuit did not accept the ar-\ngument, assessing the case under Rule 60(b)(6). See \nPet.App.6-7. BLOM did not challenge the district \ncourt\u2019s or circuit court\u2019s application of Rule 60(b)(6) in \nits petition for certiorari or in their merits brief to this \nCourt. \nIV. \nExtraordinary Circumstances Are Present \nHere Because After Honickman II Clarified \nthe Previously \u201cAmbigu[ous]\u201d Legal Stand-\nards, Plaintiffs Were Denied Any Oppor-\ntunity to Meet Them. \nAs this Court has explained, \u201c[i]n determining \nwhether extraordinary circumstances are present \n\n \n \n \n \n \n45 \n \n[under Rule 60(b)(6)], a court may consider a wide \nrange of factors,\u201d including \u201c\u2018the risk of injustice to the \nparties\u2019 and \u2018the risk of undermining the public\u2019s con-\nfidence in the judicial process.\u2019\u201d Buck, 580 U.S. at 123 \n(quoting Liljeberg, 486 U.S. at 864). In Mandala, the \nSecond Circuit noted several factors in that case that \nestablished exceptional circumstances for purposes of \na motion for post-judgment amendment: \n[1] Plaintiffs have yet to be afforded a single op-\nportunity to amend their pleading; [2] the orig-\ninal dismissal of the Complaint was premised \non grounds subject to reasonable, actual, and \nvigorous debate; [3] Plaintiffs diligently prose-\ncuted their case at all times; and [4] Plaintiffs\u2019 \nproposed amendments address the sole plead-\ning deficiency identified by the district court.  \n88 F.4th at 365.  \nPlaintiffs meet all of these factors here. Denying \nPlaintiffs leave to amend risks injustice, as they may \nlose their only opportunity to have this case decided on \nthe merits, as the statute of limitations has run on \ntheir claims. See LeBlanc v. Cleveland, 248 F.3d 95, \n101 (2d Cir. 2001) (finding \u201c\u2018extraordinary circum-\nstances\u2019 under Rule 60(b)(6), because [plaintiff] would \nbe left without a remedy if the motion [for vacatur and \nleave to amend] were not granted\u201d). And where the \ncase is at its earliest stage, with no discovery con-\nducted, the prejudice to BLOM is limited solely to \nbriefing a new motion to dismiss against allegations \ntailored to meet the legal standards articulated by the \nSecond Circuit and this Court in Taamneh. The poten-\ntial burden of re-briefing a motion to dismiss is already \nbuilt into Rules 15(a)(1) and (2) and is not the kind of \nprejudice that the Rule considers. See, e.g., Patton v. \nGuyer, 443 F.2d 79, 86 (10th Cir. 1971) (\u201cThere is \n\n \n \n \n \n \n46 \n \ninvariably some practical prejudice resulting from an \namendment, but this is not the test for refusal of an \namendment. . . . The defendants were not prejudiced \nin terms of preparing their defense to the amend-\nment.\u201d). \nIndeed, courts have applied more liberal standards \nto motions for post-judgment amendment at early \nstages in the litigation. For example, the Fifth Circuit \nheld that \u201cthe Rule 15 standards apply when a party \nseeks to amend a judgment that has been entered \nbased on the pleadings,\u201d but doubted whether those \nstandards would apply \u201cafter trial.\u201d S. Constructors \nGrp. v. Dynalectric Co., 2 F.3d 606, 611 (5th Cir. 1993). \nSee also Duggins v. Steak \u2018n Shake, Inc., 195 F.3d 828, \n834 (6th Cir. 1999) (holding that amendment risks sig-\nnificant prejudice \u201cafter the close of discovery\u201d); Ru-\notolo v. City of N.Y., 514 F.3d 184, 187, 192 (2d Cir. \n2008) (similar).  \nPlaintiffs have also yet to be afforded a single \nmeaningful opportunity to amend their complaint; the \nbasis for the original dismissal of the complaint was \nnot merely open to \u201cvigorous debate,\u201d Mandala, 88 \nF.4th at 365, but entirely incorrect; Plaintiffs dili-\ngently prosecuted their case, appealing and moving for \nvacatur expeditiously; and Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed amend-\nments could address the actual defects in the com-\nplaint that the Second Circuit identified.  \nBLOM argues that no extraordinary circumstances \nare present here because (1) the district court\u2019s deci-\nsion was affirmed on the same grounds it provided; (2) \nPlaintiffs waived any \u201cright\u201d to an amendment be-\ncause they did not take the district court\u2019s invitations \nto amend; (3) even if the district court was wrong, a \nclarification or change in law is not an extraordinary \ncircumstance; and (4) Plaintiffs are at \u201cfault\u201d for \n\n \n \n \n \n \n47 \n \nfailing to amend or delaying doing so. Pet.Br.39-45. \nThe first two reasons are addressed above: the dismis-\nsal decision was premised on \u201cthe wrong legal stand-\nard,\u201d and the Second Circuit did not find that Plaintiffs \n\u201cwaived\u201d any meaningful opportunities to amend.  \nBLOM asserts that \u201cmere clarification of the law is \nnot extraordinary,\u201d as it \u201cis what appellate courts do \nday in and day out\u201d\u2014and, in fact, \u201cthis Court has held \nthat even an outright change in the law does not war-\nrant relief under Rule 60(b)(6).\u201d Pet.Br.19 (citing Gon-\nzalez, 545 U.S. at 537). But in Gonzalez, the change in \nlaw was made in another case after the case under re-\nview was decided, leading this Court to remark: \u201c[i]t is \nhardly extraordinary that subsequently, after peti-\ntioner\u2019s case was no longer pending, this Court arrived \nat a different interpretation.\u201d 545 U.S. at 537. Moreo-\nver, Mr. Gonzalez failed to show sufficient diligence \nbecause he did not \u201cseek review of the District Court\u2019s \ndecision\u201d on the issue relating to his vacatur motion. \nId.  \nHere the \u201cclarification\u201d came in the same case, as a \nresult of Plaintiffs\u2019 appeal. See Charles Schwab, 883 \nF.3d at 89-90. The Second Circuit \u201cacknowledge[d] the \ndistrict court\u2019s decision came before our opinion \nin Kaplan [II] clarified the import of our earlier \nJASTA aiding-and-abetting precedents which may \nhave generated some ambiguity as to the proper \nstandard.\u201d Pet.App.40 n.11. It is manifestly unfair to \nexpect Plaintiffs to fully understand a set of legal \nstandards that were still being \u201crecast[],\u201d Oral Arg. at \n13:23-38, when the district court could not. \nBLOM argues in the alternative that if the Second \nCircuit\u2019s clarification was \u201cin line with [Plaintiffs\u2019] \nown interpretation\u201d of JASTA, Plaintiffs \u201cnever \u2018ex-\nplain[ed] why they did not allege facts sufficient to \n\n \n \n \n \n \n48 \n \nsatisfy the standard for which they were advocating.\u2019\u201d \nPet.Br.41 (quoting Pet.App.17 n.5). But while Plain-\ntiffs were indeed broadly correct about JASTA\u2019s plead-\ning standards\u2014a fact that BLOM argues somehow \ncounts against them\u2014they could not anticipate the ev-\nidentiary distinction newly articulated by the Second \nCircuit between \u201cpublicly available evidence\u201d and \n\u201cpublic sources.\u201d \nIn fact, this Court has held that even a change in \nlaw in another case can constitute extraordinary cir-\ncumstances. See Kemp v. United States, 596 U.S. 528, \n540 (2022) (noting \u201cthe availability of Rule 60(b)(6) to \nreopen a judgment in extraordinary circumstances, in-\ncluding a change in controlling law\u201d and citing cases) \n(Sotomayor, J., concurring). For example, a change in \nlaw relating to the same incident justified reversing a \nthree-year-old denial of certiorari, because \u201cthe inter-\nest in finality of litigation must yield where the inter-\nests of justice would make unfair the strict application \nof our rules\u201d\u2014another recitation of the balancing test. \nGondeck v. Pan Am. World Airways, Inc., 382 U.S. 25, \n26-28 (1965). The Tenth Circuit also found such a \nchange in law in another case an \u201cextraordinary situ-\nation justifying Rule 60(b)(6) relief.\u201d Pierce v. Cook & \nCo., 518 F.2d 720, 723-24 (10th Cir. 1975) (en banc). \nThe interests of justice and demands of fairness are \neven more pronounced when the relevant \u201cchange in \nlaw\u201d occurs in the same case.  \nPetitioner\u2019s fourth waiver argument is wrong as \nwell: unlike BLOM\u2019s cases rejecting post-judgment \namendments that were strategically delayed like \nJames and Rozensweig, Plaintiffs here are not at any \n\u201cfault\u201d and did not engage in any \u201cgamesmanship.\u201d \nPet.Br.27, 33, 36, 44. They timely appealed the district \ncourt\u2019s incorrect dismissal decision and, once \u201c[a]rmed \n\n \n \n \n \n \n49 \n \nwith [the Second Circuit\u2019s] clarifications,\u201d promptly \nmoved for vacatur and leave to amend. There was no \n\u201cundue delay\u201d\u2014although \u201cdelay alone, regardless of \nits length is not enough to bar [amendment] if the \nother party is not prejudiced.\u201d Moore v. Paducah, 790 \nF.2d 557, 560 (6th Cir. 1986) (quoting 3 Moore\u2019s Fed-\neral Practice, para. 15.08 at 15.76). As explained \nabove, BLOM would not be unduly prejudiced by vaca-\ntur and amendment here. \nCONCLUSION \nBLOM quotes extensively from Ackermann v. \nUnited States to argue that \u201c\u2018[t]here must be an end to \nlitigation someday . . . .\u201d Pet.Br.1, 29 (quoting 340 U.S. \n193, 198 (1950)). BLOM\u2019s comparison of Ackermann to \nthis case is illustrative of its arguments generally. In \nAckermann, the petitioners sought vacatur four years \nafter judgments were entered following a trial, in or-\nder to bring an extremely late appeal. This case has \nnever even entered discovery. See Dubicz v. Common-\nwealth Edison Co., 377 F.3d 787, 793 n.1 (7th Cir. \n2004) (\u201cIt is important to emphasize that this litiga-\ntion has never progressed beyond the pleadings stage. \nThis is not the case where a plaintiff seeks to amend \nits complaint after the close of discovery or on the eve \nof trial.\u201d). Plaintiffs did file a timely and necessary ap-\npeal. Dismissal here is hardly what this Court in \nAckermann meant by \u201csomeday.\u201d \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be af-\nfirmed and the case should be remanded for further \nproceedings.  \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n50 \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \n \nMichael Radine \n Counsel of Record \nGary M.

To form a balanced and accurate prediction, it is absolutely essential to understand the respondents' counterarguments. This action, which seeks the respondents' main brief, will provide the core legal and policy reasons why the Second Circuit's decision should be affirmed. This information is fundamental to weighing the competing legal principles at the heart of the case (finality under Rule 60(b) vs. liberal amendment under Rule 15(a)). Therefore, the Task EIG is very high, as this document is a primary source for the opposing viewpoint. The Design EIG is moderate; while obtaining the respondent's brief is a standard and crucial step in any case analysis, it reinforces a known-good strategy rather than revealing a novel one. It confirms the importance of systematically gathering arguments from all parties before attempting a prediction.",

Circuit courts generally hold that \nmeans providing an opportunity to amend once a ruling \nidentifies remediable defects, if any, in a pleading. Fail-\ning to provide that opportunity may constitute an \u201cex-\ntraordinary circumstance\u201d and a basis to vacate a judg-\nment under Rule 60(b)(6).  \nHere, the Second Circuit found that the district \ncourt dismissed Respondents\u2019 complaint by applying \nthe \u201cwrong legal standard\u201d for pleading an aiding and \nabetting claim (in the Second Circuit) under the Justice \nAgainst Sponsors of Terrorism Act, as well as a stand-\nard for pleading knowledge that was \u201ctoo exacting\u201d and \nall but impossible to meet by amendment. The circuit \ncourt provided clarified pleading standards and identi-\nfied specific, remediable defects in the complaint. Re-\nspondents then promptly moved to vacate the district \ncourt\u2019s judgment in order to meet those clarified stand-\nards in an amended complaint\u2014their first in this litiga-\ntion. The district court refused and, after Respondents \nappealed again, the circuit issued a non-precedential \nsummary order remanding the case for \u201crecon-\nsider[ation].\u201d \nThe question presented is thus whether the circuit \ncourt erred in directing the district court to reconsider \nits refusal to grant Respondents an opportunity to meet \nthe pleading standards the circuit corrected in the prior \nappeal. \n \n \n\nii \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \nQUESTION PRESENTED ............................................. i \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES ......................................... iv \nINTRODUCTION .......................................................... 1 \nSTATEMENT ................................................................ 4 \nI. \nThe Complaint and Pre-Motion Conference for \nBLOM\u2019s Motion to Dismiss .............................. 4 \nII. \nThe Motion to Dismiss ..................................... 7 \nIII.

The dis-\ntrict court had denied vacatur because Plaintiffs de-\nclined its pre-dismissal invitations to amend their \ncomplaint\u2014but the circuit court found the district \ncourt was applying the \u201cwrong\u201d pleading standards, \nPet.App.5, which were so overly \u201cexacting\u201d that Plain-\ntiffs could not meet them before discovery, Pet.App.49.  \nPetitioner (\u201cBLOM\u201d) argues that by making this \nstraightforward remand, the Second Circuit has effec-\ntively \u201cabandon[ed] the \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 \nstandard in favor of a nebulous \u2018balanc[ing]\u2019 inquiry \nthat pits Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s protection of \u2018finality\u2019 against \n\u2018Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policies.\u2019\u201d Pet.Br.25 \n(quoting Pet.App.8). In BLOM\u2019s telling, the Second \nCircuit has \u201cjettisoned\u201d Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s guardrails, \nPet.Br.14., and motions for post-judgment amend-\nments will now be all but rubber-stamped in the cir-\ncuit. This is incorrect. \nFirst of all, this conclusion is not supported by the \nspare language of the summary order, which simply \ndirects the district court to \u201creconsider\u201d denying vaca-\ntur given Second Circuit and Supreme Court prece-\ndents. Nothing has been \u201cabandoned\u201d\u2014consistent \nwith decisions from this Court, \u201c[r]elief under Rule \n60(b)(6)\u201d in the Second Circuit \u201cis reserved for cases \nthat present \u2018extraordinary circumstances,\u2019\u201d including \nwhere a party seeks post-judgment amendment. Man-\ndala v. NTT Data, Inc., 88 F.4th 353, 361 (2d Cir. 2023) \n(citation omitted). Indeed, the standards the Second \n\n \n \n \n \n \n2 \n \nCircuit has \u201cdeveloped\u201d\u2014and reaffirmed by the sum-\nmary order below\u2014\u201cfor evaluating postjudgment mo-\ntions generally place significant emphasis on the \n\u2018value of finality and repose.\u2019\u201d Williams v. Citigroup \nInc., 659 F.3d 208, 213 (2d Cir. 2011) (citation omit-\nted). \nSecond, balancing finality and justice is not \u201cnebu-\nlous,\u201d as BLOM calls it, but rather inherent to Rule \n60(b)(6) jurisprudence: The rule\u2019s \u201cextraordinary cir-\ncumstances\u201d requirement \u201cexists in order to balance \nthe broad language of Rule 60(b)(6), which allows \ncourts to set aside judgments for \u2018any\u2019 reason justify-\ning relief, with the interest in the finality of judg-\nments.\u201d Budget Blinds, Inc. v. White, 536 F.3d 244, \n255 (3d Cir. 2008). When considering a motion to \namend a complaint, finality interests are \u201cbalance[d] \n. . . with the preference expressed in the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure in general, and Rule 15 in particu-\nlar, for resolving disputes on their merits.\u201d Krupski v. \nCosta Crociere S. p. A., 560 U.S. 538, 550 (2010).  \nThird, this case does involve truly \u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d because (1) the district court dismissed \nthe complaint using a set of \u201cwrong legal standards,\u201d \nincluding the nearly impossible requirement of alleg-\ning, without the opportunity for any discovery, \u201cacts or \nstatements\u201d of \u201cBLOM employees\u201d to demonstrate the \nbank\u2019s knowledge; (2) the circuit court rejected those \nstandards on appeal\u2014including the direct evidence re-\nquirement\u2014and \u201cclarified\u201d the correct ones; (3) the cir-\ncuit court found that Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations were none-\ntheless too \u201climited\u201d to meet the clarified standards, \ndrawing a newly announced distinction between \nPlaintiffs\u2019 \u201cpublicly available\u201d evidence and \u201cpublic \nsources such as media articles,\u201d Pet.App.50 & n.18; (4) \nthe circuit court identified several remediable defects \n\n \n \n \n \n \n3 \n \nin the complaint that the district court had not, such \nas clarifying that cash withdrawals are untraceable \nand alleging the degree to which Israeli terrorism des-\nignations were publicized; and (5) Plaintiffs had not \nyet amended their complaint even once. In these one-\nof-a-kind circumstances, the Rules\u2019 strong preference \nfor deciding cases on their merits entitles Plaintiffs to \nhave at least one opportunity to cure those defects. \nBLOM\u2019s argument is therefore premised on con-\nstruing the case\u2019s procedural history to suggest the \nSecond Circuit found that Plaintiffs \u201cwaived\u201d their \nright to amend post-judgment but nevertheless \u201cdi-\nrected district courts to override and rescue parties \nfrom their \u2018free, calculated, [and] deliberate choices,\u2019\u201d \nsuch as \u201cwhen the movant has consistently and con-\nsciously rejected numerous invitations and opportuni-\nties to amend.\u201d Pet.Br.28-29 (citations omitted).  \nBut the Second Circuit never accepted BLOM\u2019s \n\u201cwaiver\u201d argument. To the contrary, it recognized that \nPlaintiffs did not have a meaningful opportunity to \namend at all because \u201cthe district court applied the \nwrong legal standard for aiding-and-abetting liability \nunder JASTA,\u201d Pet.App.5, and a standard for pleading \nknowledge that was \u201ctoo exacting,\u201d Pet.App.49. In fact, \nthe district court\u2019s knowledge pleading standard was \nunmeetable\u2014as Circuit Court Judge Wesley noted in \nresponse to BLOM\u2019s insistence at oral argument that \nPlaintiffs waived opportunities to amend: \u201cWhat are \nthey supposed to do? They know they can\u2019t amend [to] \n. . . meet that.\u201d Oral Arg. at 11:52-:56, Honickman, No. \n22-1039 (2d Cir. Oct. 5, 2023), https://ww3.ca2. \nuscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/6a33dfa3-27c7-4b0a-\n82ee-86c41553c09a/1/doc/22-1039.mp3. \nIgnoring this, BLOM further insists that \u201cthe Sec-\nond Circuit affirmed the dismissal on grounds that the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n4 \n \nDistrict Court had relied on,\u201d Pet.Br. 40\u2014but the dis-\ntrict court itself acknowledged that the decision was \naffirmed \u201con other grounds.\u201d Pet.App.10. Most im-\nportantly, BLOM\u2019s reading of the record is irrelevant \nto the question presented\u2014the summary order below \nwas not premised on any such finding and thus did not \ndirect district courts to \u201coverride\u201d waivers.  \nThe unusual procedural history of this case makes \nclear that no meaningful opportunities to satisfy the \ncorrect legal standards were available to Plaintiffs and \ntherefore the remand to the district court was not a \ndeparture from Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s long-recognized stand-\nards. Rather, in the Second Circuit parties who de-\nclined meaningful invitations \u201care not entitled to relief \nfrom the judgment.\u201d Metzler Inv. GmbH v. Chipotle \nMexican Grill, Inc., 970 F.3d 133, 148 (2d Cir. 2020).  \nThis is not unusual\u2014the circuits broadly require \ndistrict courts to provide at least one opportunity to \namend, often after dismissal when the complaint\u2019s re-\nmediable defects, if any, are correctly identified by a \ncourt ruling. Refusing leave to amend after dismissal \nis thus often an abuse of discretion\u2014the result is no \ndifferent here, except that Plaintiffs were compelled to \nappeal the district court\u2019s erroneous decision first. \nSTATEMENT \nI. \nThe Complaint and Pre-Motion Conference \nfor BLOM\u2019s Motion to Dismiss \nPlaintiffs filed their complaint on January 1, 2019, \nasserting claims under the Anti-Terrorism Act \n(\u201cATA\u201d), as amended by the Justice Against Sponsors \nof Terrorism Act (\u201cJASTA\u201d), and alleging that BLOM \naided and abetted a series of terrorist attacks commit-\nted by the Palestinian foreign terrorist organization \n(\u201cFTO\u201d) Hamas (or \u201cHAMAS\u201d) that injured Plaintiffs. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n5 \n \nSpecifically, Plaintiffs alleged that BLOM knowingly \nprovided substantial assistance to three Hamas fund-\nraisers (the \u201cThree Customers\u201d), including the pur-\nported charitable institution Sanabil, which the \nUnited States designated a Specially Designated \nGlobal Terrorist (\u201cSDGT\u201d) in 2003. Relying in part on \nfinancial records disclosed during the criminal trial of \nthe Holy Land Foundation (\u201cHLF,\u201d a notorious Hamas \nfundraiser) in Texas, Plaintiffs alleged that BLOM as-\nsisted the Three Customers in converting millions of \ndollars of donations from HLF and other Hamas sup-\nporters abroad into cash (notwithstanding BLOM\u2019s de-\nscription of its services as \u201croutine,\u201d Pet.Br.5-6), which \nthey used, inter alia, to recruit Palestinians living in \nLebanon to join and support Hamas before and during \nthe \u201cSecond Intifada,\u201d when the acts of terrorism at is-\nsue here occurred.  \nPlaintiffs alleged BLOM\u2019s knowledge by \u201crefer-\nences to media articles and publications on the Three \nCustomers\u2019 connection to Hamas.\u201d Pet.App.49. Plain-\ntiffs also alleged that Sanabil\u2019s board included contem-\nporaneous Hamas leaders in Lebanon. JA.105, 114. \nPlaintiffs alleged that Israel designated another one of \nthe Three Customers, the Union of Good, as \u201cpart of \nthe Hamas organization\u201d in 2002, during the relevant \nperiod (1998-2004, JA.82). JA.118. The Union of \nGood\u2019s infamous leader, Sheikh Qaradawi, regularly \nappeared on television during that period extolling the \nvirtues of suicide bombings against Israel. JA.120.  \nPlaintiffs also alleged that BLOM converted mil-\nlions of dollars for the Three Customers from not only \nHLF, but also from its successor KindHearts after the \nUnited States designated HLF an SDGT in 2001, \nJA.99-100, 106-13, 117, and from Al Aqsa Foundation \nafter Israel designated it a Hamas entity and its \n\n \n \n \n \n \n6 \n \nheadquarters were shuttered by the German govern-\nment\u2014and one transaction after the United States \ndesignated it an SDGT. JA.95-96, 113.  \nOn May 3, 2019, BLOM filed a letter requesting a \npre-motion conference to initiate a motion to dismiss \nthe complaint for failure to state a claim, setting forth \na summary of its anticipated arguments. JA.142-47. \nThese arguments, which the district court later \nadopted in dismissing the complaint, were incon-\nsistent with JASTA\u2019s plain language, the interpreta-\ntive guidance in Halberstam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472 \n(D.C. Cir. 1983)\u2014which Congress set as the legal \nframework for JASTA\u2014and the Second Circuit\u2019s then-\nonly prior JASTA ruling in Linde v. Arab Bank, PLC, \n882 F.3d 314 (2d Cir. 2018).  \nPlaintiffs provided a summary of their anticipated \nopposition in a letter on May 8, 2019. JA.148-55. Spe-\ncifically, Plaintiffs relied on the standards from both \nLinde and Halberstam and noted that foreseeability \nwas the key factor in assessing a defendant\u2019s wrongful \nconduct under JASTA. As shown below, the district \ncourt ultimately adopted BLOM\u2019s arguments and re-\njected foreseeability. See Pet.App.71-72. The Second \nCircuit subsequently vindicated Plaintiffs\u2019 analysis, as \ndid this Court four years later. See Twitter, Inc. v. \nTaamneh, 598 U.S. 471, 496 (2023).  \nThe district court held a pre-motion conference on \nMay 15, 2019. After raising sua sponte whether BLOM \nhad an affirmative defense based on the statute of lim-\nitations, Pet.App.91, the court then stated:  \nI am just wondering if it might be prudent to \nallow the plaintiffs to amend their complaint, \nnot to add more claims, not to add more parties, \nbut rather to factually support some of the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n7 \n \nclaims that [defense counsel] have identified as \nbeing deficient regarding the standards that \nwere adopted by [Linde] from [Halberstam]. \n[Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel], do you want that oppor-\ntunity?  \nPet.App.93. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel responded, \u201cNo, I think \nwe are prepared to brief it based on the arguments pre-\nsented in [our] pre-motion letter.\u201d Id. This position was \nappropriate given that Plaintiffs\u2019 readings of Linde \nand Halberstam were substantively correct, whereas \nBLOM\u2019s contrary positions were not. \nFollowing the pre-motion conference, the district \ncourt issued a Minute Entry and Scheduling Order \nnoting: \u201cThe Court offered Plaintiffs an opportunity to \namend their complaint to add additional information \nin response to the arguments raised by Defendant. \nPlaintiffs declined . . . to amend their Complaint in \nthis regard.\u201d JA.156 (emphasis added). That is, the \ndistrict court offered Plaintiffs the opportunity to meet \nBLOM\u2019s urged legal standards, which they reasonably \ndeclined\u2014as shown by the circuit\u2019s later \u201cclarification\u201d \nof the applicable standards. \nII. \nThe Motion to Dis\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Circuit courts generally hold that \nmeans providing an opportunity to amend once a ruling \nidentifies remediable defects, if any, in a pleading. Fail-\ning to provide that opportunity may constitute an \u201cex-\ntraordinary circumstance\u201d and a basis to vacate a judg-\nment under Rule 60(b)(6).  \nHere, the Second Circuit found that the district \ncourt dismissed Respondents\u2019 complaint by applying \nthe \u201cwrong legal standard\u201d for pleading an aiding and \nabetting claim (in the Second Circuit) under the Justice \nAgainst Sponsors of Terrorism Act, as well as a stand-\nard for pleading knowledge that was \u201ctoo exacting\u201d and \nall but impossible to meet by amendment. The circuit \ncourt provided clarified pleading standards and identi-\nfied specific, remediable defects in the complaint. Re-\nspondents then promptly moved to vacate the district \ncourt\u2019s judgment in order to meet those clarified stand-\nards in an amended complaint\u2014their first in this litiga-\ntion. The district court refused and, after Respondents \nappealed again, the circuit issued a non-precedential \nsummary order remanding the case for \u201crecon-\nsider[ation].\u201d \nThe question presented is thus whether the circuit \ncourt erred in directing the district court to reconsider \nits refusal to grant Respondents an opportunity to meet \nthe pleading standards the circuit corrected in the prior \nappeal. \n \n \n\nii \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \nQUESTION PRESENTED ............................................. i \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES ......................................... iv \nINTRODUCTION .......................................................... 1 \nSTATEMENT ................................................................ 4 \nI. \nThe Complaint and Pre-Motion Conference for \nBLOM\u2019s Motion to Dismiss .............................. 4 \nII. \nThe Motion to Dismiss ..................................... 7 \nIII.

The dis-\ntrict court had denied vacatur because Plaintiffs de-\nclined its pre-dismissal invitations to amend their \ncomplaint\u2014but the circuit court found the district \ncourt was applying the \u201cwrong\u201d pleading standards, \nPet.App.5, which were so overly \u201cexacting\u201d that Plain-\ntiffs could not meet them before discovery, Pet.App.49.  \nPetitioner (\u201cBLOM\u201d) argues that by making this \nstraightforward remand, the Second Circuit has effec-\ntively \u201cabandon[ed] the \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 \nstandard in favor of a nebulous \u2018balanc[ing]\u2019 inquiry \nthat pits Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s protection of \u2018finality\u2019 against \n\u2018Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policies.\u2019\u201d Pet.Br.25 \n(quoting Pet.App.8). In BLOM\u2019s telling, the Second \nCircuit has \u201cjettisoned\u201d Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s guardrails, \nPet.Br.14., and motions for post-judgment amend-\nments will now be all but rubber-stamped in the cir-\ncuit. This is incorrect. \nFirst of all, this conclusion is not supported by the \nspare language of the summary order, which simply \ndirects the district court to \u201creconsider\u201d denying vaca-\ntur given Second Circuit and Supreme Court prece-\ndents. Nothing has been \u201cabandoned\u201d\u2014consistent \nwith decisions from this Court, \u201c[r]elief under Rule \n60(b)(6)\u201d in the Second Circuit \u201cis reserved for cases \nthat present \u2018extraordinary circumstances,\u2019\u201d including \nwhere a party seeks post-judgment amendment. Man-\ndala v. NTT Data, Inc., 88 F.4th 353, 361 (2d Cir. 2023) \n(citation omitted). Indeed, the standards the Second \n\n \n \n \n \n \n2 \n \nCircuit has \u201cdeveloped\u201d\u2014and reaffirmed by the sum-\nmary order below\u2014\u201cfor evaluating postjudgment mo-\ntions generally place significant emphasis on the \n\u2018value of finality and repose.\u2019\u201d Williams v. Citigroup \nInc., 659 F.3d 208, 213 (2d Cir. 2011) (citation omit-\nted). \nSecond, balancing finality and justice is not \u201cnebu-\nlous,\u201d as BLOM calls it, but rather inherent to Rule \n60(b)(6) jurisprudence: The rule\u2019s \u201cextraordinary cir-\ncumstances\u201d requirement \u201cexists in order to balance \nthe broad language of Rule 60(b)(6), which allows \ncourts to set aside judgments for \u2018any\u2019 reason justify-\ning relief, with the interest in the finality of judg-\nments.\u201d Budget Blinds, Inc. v. White, 536 F.3d 244, \n255 (3d Cir. 2008). When considering a motion to \namend a complaint, finality interests are \u201cbalance[d] \n. . . with the preference expressed in the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure in general, and Rule 15 in particu-\nlar, for resolving disputes on their merits.\u201d Krupski v. \nCosta Crociere S. p. A., 560 U.S. 538, 550 (2010).  \nThird, this case does involve truly \u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d because (1) the district court dismissed \nthe complaint using a set of \u201cwrong legal standards,\u201d \nincluding the nearly impossible requirement of alleg-\ning, without the opportunity for any discovery, \u201cacts or \nstatements\u201d of \u201cBLOM employees\u201d to demonstrate the \nbank\u2019s knowledge; (2) the circuit court rejected those \nstandards on appeal\u2014including the direct evidence re-\nquirement\u2014and \u201cclarified\u201d the correct ones; (3) the cir-\ncuit court found that Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations were none-\ntheless too \u201climited\u201d to meet the clarified standards, \ndrawing a newly announced distinction between \nPlaintiffs\u2019 \u201cpublicly available\u201d evidence and \u201cpublic \nsources such as media articles,\u201d Pet.App.50 & n.18; (4) \nthe circuit court identified several remediable defects \n\n \n \n \n \n \n3 \n \nin the complaint that the district court had not, such \nas clarifying that cash withdrawals are untraceable \nand alleging the degree to which Israeli terrorism des-\nignations were publicized; and (5) Plaintiffs had not \nyet amended their complaint even once. In these one-\nof-a-kind circumstances, the Rules\u2019 strong preference \nfor deciding cases on their merits entitles Plaintiffs to \nhave at least one opportunity to cure those defects. \nBLOM\u2019s argument is therefore premised on con-\nstruing the case\u2019s procedural history to suggest the \nSecond Circuit found that Plaintiffs \u201cwaived\u201d their \nright to amend post-judgment but nevertheless \u201cdi-\nrected district courts to override and rescue parties \nfrom their \u2018free, calculated, [and] deliberate choices,\u2019\u201d \nsuch as \u201cwhen the movant has consistently and con-\nsciously rejected numerous invitations and opportuni-\nties to amend.\u201d Pet.Br.28-29 (citations omitted).  \nBut the Second Circuit never accepted BLOM\u2019s \n\u201cwaiver\u201d argument. To the contrary, it recognized that \nPlaintiffs did not have a meaningful opportunity to \namend at all because \u201cthe district court applied the \nwrong legal standard for aiding-and-abetting liability \nunder JASTA,\u201d Pet.App.5, and a standard for pleading \nknowledge that was \u201ctoo exacting,\u201d Pet.App.49. In fact, \nthe district court\u2019s knowledge pleading standard was \nunmeetable\u2014as Circuit Court Judge Wesley noted in \nresponse to BLOM\u2019s insistence at oral argument that \nPlaintiffs waived opportunities to amend: \u201cWhat are \nthey supposed to do? They know they can\u2019t amend [to] \n. . . meet that.\u201d Oral Arg. at 11:52-:56, Honickman, No. \n22-1039 (2d Cir. Oct. 5, 2023), https://ww3.ca2. \nuscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/6a33dfa3-27c7-4b0a-\n82ee-86c41553c09a/1/doc/22-1039.mp3. \nIgnoring this, BLOM further insists that \u201cthe Sec-\nond Circuit affirmed the dismissal on grounds that the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n4 \n \nDistrict Court had relied on,\u201d Pet.Br. 40\u2014but the dis-\ntrict court itself acknowledged that the decision was \naffirmed \u201con other grounds.\u201d Pet.App.10. Most im-\nportantly, BLOM\u2019s reading of the record is irrelevant \nto the question presented\u2014the summary order below \nwas not premised on any such finding and thus did not \ndirect district courts to \u201coverride\u201d waivers.  \nThe unusual procedural history of this case makes \nclear that no meaningful opportunities to satisfy the \ncorrect legal standards were available to Plaintiffs and \ntherefore the remand to the district court was not a \ndeparture from Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s long-recognized stand-\nards. Rather, in the Second Circuit parties who de-\nclined meaningful invitations \u201care not entitled to relief \nfrom the judgment.\u201d Metzler Inv. GmbH v. Chipotle \nMexican Grill, Inc., 970 F.3d 133, 148 (2d Cir. 2020).  \nThis is not unusual\u2014the circuits broadly require \ndistrict courts to provide at least one opportunity to \namend, often after dismissal when the complaint\u2019s re-\nmediable defects, if any, are correctly identified by a \ncourt ruling. Refusing leave to amend after dismissal \nis thus often an abuse of discretion\u2014the result is no \ndifferent here, except that Plaintiffs were compelled to \nappeal the district court\u2019s erroneous decision first. \nSTATEMENT \nI. \nThe Complaint and Pre-Motion Conference \nfor BLOM\u2019s Motion to Dismiss \nPlaintiffs filed their complaint on January 1, 2019, \nasserting claims under the Anti-Terrorism Act \n(\u201cATA\u201d), as amended by the Justice Against Sponsors \nof Terrorism Act (\u201cJASTA\u201d), and alleging that BLOM \naided and abetted a series of terrorist attacks commit-\nted by the Palestinian foreign terrorist organization \n(\u201cFTO\u201d) Hamas (or \u201cHAMAS\u201d) that injured Plaintiffs. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n5 \n \nSpecifically, Plaintiffs alleged that BLOM knowingly \nprovided substantial assistance to three Hamas fund-\nraisers (the \u201cThree Customers\u201d), including the pur-\nported charitable institution Sanabil, which the \nUnited States designated a Specially Designated \nGlobal Terrorist (\u201cSDGT\u201d) in 2003. Relying in part on \nfinancial records disclosed during the criminal trial of \nthe Holy Land Foundation (\u201cHLF,\u201d a notorious Hamas \nfundraiser) in Texas, Plaintiffs alleged that BLOM as-\nsisted the Three Customers in converting millions of \ndollars of donations from HLF and other Hamas sup-\nporters abroad into cash (notwithstanding BLOM\u2019s de-\nscription of its services as \u201croutine,\u201d Pet.Br.5-6), which \nthey used, inter alia, to recruit Palestinians living in \nLebanon to join and support Hamas before and during \nthe \u201cSecond Intifada,\u201d when the acts of terrorism at is-\nsue here occurred.  \nPlaintiffs alleged BLOM\u2019s knowledge by \u201crefer-\nences to media articles and publications on the Three \nCustomers\u2019 connection to Hamas.\u201d Pet.App.49. Plain-\ntiffs also alleged that Sanabil\u2019s board included contem-\nporaneous Hamas leaders in Lebanon. JA.105, 114. \nPlaintiffs alleged that Israel designated another one of \nthe Three Customers, the Union of Good, as \u201cpart of \nthe Hamas organization\u201d in 2002, during the relevant \nperiod (1998-2004, JA.82). JA.118. The Union of \nGood\u2019s infamous leader, Sheikh Qaradawi, regularly \nappeared on television during that period extolling the \nvirtues of suicide bombings against Israel. JA.120.  \nPlaintiffs also alleged that BLOM converted mil-\nlions of dollars for the Three Customers from not only \nHLF, but also from its successor KindHearts after the \nUnited States designated HLF an SDGT in 2001, \nJA.99-100, 106-13, 117, and from Al Aqsa Foundation \nafter Israel designated it a Hamas entity and its \n\n \n \n \n \n \n6 \n \nheadquarters were shuttered by the German govern-\nment\u2014and one transaction after the United States \ndesignated it an SDGT. JA.95-96, 113.  \nOn May 3, 2019, BLOM filed a letter requesting a \npre-motion conference to initiate a motion to dismiss \nthe complaint for failure to state a claim, setting forth \na summary of its anticipated arguments. JA.142-47. \nThese arguments, which the district court later \nadopted in dismissing the complaint, were incon-\nsistent with JASTA\u2019s plain language, the interpreta-\ntive guidance in Halberstam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472 \n(D.C. Cir. 1983)\u2014which Congress set as the legal \nframework for JASTA\u2014and the Second Circuit\u2019s then-\nonly prior JASTA ruling in Linde v. Arab Bank, PLC, \n882 F.3d 314 (2d Cir. 2018).  \nPlaintiffs provided a summary of their anticipated \nopposition in a letter on May 8, 2019. JA.148-55. Spe-\ncifically, Plaintiffs relied on the standards from both \nLinde and Halberstam and noted that foreseeability \nwas the key factor in assessing a defendant\u2019s wrongful \nconduct under JASTA. As shown below, the district \ncourt ultimately adopted BLOM\u2019s arguments and re-\njected foreseeability. See Pet.App.71-72. The Second \nCircuit subsequently vindicated Plaintiffs\u2019 analysis, as \ndid this Court four years later. See Twitter, Inc. v. \nTaamneh, 598 U.S. 471, 496 (2023).  \nThe district court held a pre-motion conference on \nMay 15, 2019. After raising sua sponte whether BLOM \nhad an affirmative defense based on the statute of lim-\nitations, Pet.App.91, the court then stated:  \nI am just wondering if it might be prudent to \nallow the plaintiffs to amend their complaint, \nnot to add more claims, not to add more parties, \nbut rather to factually support some of the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n7 \n \nclaims that [defense counsel] have identified as \nbeing deficient regarding the standards that \nwere adopted by [Linde] from [Halberstam]. \n[Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel], do you want that oppor-\ntunity?  \nPet.App.93. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel responded, \u201cNo, I think \nwe are prepared to brief it based on the arguments pre-\nsented in [our] pre-motion letter.\u201d Id. This position was \nappropriate given that Plaintiffs\u2019 readings of Linde \nand Halberstam were substantively correct, whereas \nBLOM\u2019s contrary positions were not. \nFollowing the pre-motion conference, the district \ncourt issued a Minute Entry and Scheduling Order \nnoting: \u201cThe Court offered Plaintiffs an opportunity to \namend their complaint to add additional information \nin response to the arguments raised by Defendant. \nPlaintiffs declined . . . to amend their Complaint in \nthis regard.\u201d JA.156 (emphasis added). That is, the \ndistrict court offered Plaintiffs the opportunity to meet \nBLOM\u2019s urged legal standards, which they reasonably \ndeclined\u2014as shown by the circuit\u2019s later \u201cclarification\u201d \nof the applicable standards. \nII. \nThe Motion to Dismiss \nThe parties then briefed the motion to dismiss, in \nwhich they presented arguments largely consistent \nwith the summaries set forth in their pre-motion let-\nters.  \nDuring oral argument on the motion to dismiss, \nBLOM\u2019s counsel relied heavily on a district court deci-\nsion, Kaplan v. Lebanese Canadian Bank, SAL, 405 F. \nSupp. 3d 525 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (\u201cKaplan I\u201d), vac\u2019d in rel-\nevant part, 999 F.3d 842 (2d Cir. 2021) (\u201cKaplan II\u201d). \nKaplan I dismissed JASTA claims against Lebanese \nCanadian Bank (\u201cLCB\u201d), premised on allegations that \n\n \n \n \n \n \n8 \n \nLCB provided financial services for the terrorist group \nHezbollah. As BLOM pointed out, BLOM allegedly \nprovided financial services for Hamas fundraisers in \nLebanon much as LCB did for entities controlled by \nHezbollah. Pet.App.131. \nBLOM urged the district court to adopt Kaplan I\u2019s \nerroneous pleading standards\u2014including its unwork-\nable standard for pleading scienter. Under that stand-\nard, the Kaplan I district court held that public state-\nments and media reports tying five of LCB\u2019s customers \nto Hezbollah could not support an inference of LCB\u2019s \nknowledge of those ties because \u201cPlaintiffs nowhere al-\nlege . . . that Defendant read or was aware of such \nsources.\u201d 405 F. Supp. 3d at 535. Naturally, before dis-\ncovery, a plaintiff will rarely be able to find support for \nwhat sources a defendant has actually \u201cread\u201d or was \naware of. See Pet.App.50 n.18 (\u201cpublic sources\u201d can \n\u201cplausibly suggest a defendant\u2019s knowledge which can \nbe confirmed during discovery\u201d) (emphasis added).  \nNonetheless, BLOM\u2019s counsel argued: \nFinally, I wanted to point out that the level of \nknowledge that Judge Daniels rejected in \nKaplan [I] was very much what\u2019s claimed here, \nwhere it said that it was notorious that there \nwere links between the accounts at issue there, \nbetween those persons and in that case, Hezbol-\nlah. And that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s said here. It was \napparently notorious that BLOM should have \nknown that these accounts were linked to HA-\nMAS, but there\u2019s no direct allegation of why \nBLOM should have known that.  \nPet.App.131. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel disagreed, arguing \n\u201cKaplan [I] requires a level of proof that is out of step \n\n \n \n \n \n \n9 \n \nwith JASTA, out of step with Linde and would be im-\npossible to meet.\u201d Pet.App.126.  \nDuring the oral argument, the district court again \nasked: \u201cThere are no facts that you would have to offer \nto address some of the contentions of the defendants \nregarding knowledge, especially?\u201d Pet.App.125 (em-\nphasis added). But these \u201ccontentions\u201d premised on \nKaplan I were impossible to meet on amendment\u2014\nPlaintiffs possessed no evidence that any BLOM em-\nployee \u201cread or was aware of\u201d any specific piece of in-\nformation. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel explained that while \nthey \u201ccould always add allegations, . . . the complaint \ngoes far enough in saying that BLOM holding accounts \nfor Specially Designated Global Terrorists designated \nfor . . . financing HAMAS, was generally aware of its \nrole in that [il]licit conduct, and . . . the violence that \nresulted from it was foreseeable\u201d as set forth in Linde. \nId. \nIII. \nThe District Court\u2019s Decision on the Motion \nto Dismiss and First Appeal \nThe district court granted BLOM\u2019s motion to dis-\nmiss on January 14, 2020 (\u201cHonickman I\u201d), largely on \nthe grounds BLOM raised, including\u2014as BLOM \nurged\u2014by relying heavily on Kaplan I. The district \ncourt called Kaplan I \u201ca more appropriate comparison\u201d \nand \u201ca more appropriate point of reference\u201d than other \nJASTA and ATA cases to which Plaintiffs analogized \ntheir complaint. Pet.App.77, 84.  \nFor example, and of particular importance to the \nquestion presented here, the district court adopted \nKaplan I\u2019s \u201cread-or-was-aware-of\u201d standard for plead-\ning knowledge. The district court explained that in \nKaplan I, \n\n \n \n \n \n \n10 \n \nalthough the plaintiffs argued that the entities\u2019 \nconnections to Hizbollah \u201cwas [sic] openly, pub-\nlicly and repeatedly acknowledged and publi-\ncized by Hizbollah [through its own sources]\u201d \nand \u201cin various English-language publications,\u201d \nthe plaintiffs \u201cnowhere allege[d] . . . that [LCB] \nread or was aware of such sources.\u201d The same \nanalysis applies even more strongly here, given \nthe relatively greater strength of the allegations \nin Kaplan [I]. \nPet.App.79 (quoting Kaplan I, 405 F. Supp. 3d at 535) \n(emphasis added). Having adopted this position, the \ndistrict court then faulted Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint for \nlacking allegations citing \u201cacts or statements by \nBLOM or BLOM\u2019s employees\u201d regarding its customers\u2019 \naffiliations with Hamas, instead relying on \u201cpress ar-\nticles, government actions, and allegedly \u2018public \nknowledge\u2019 discussing\u201d such connections. Pet.App.73-\n74.  \nUnsurprisingly, financial institutions do not often \npublicly admit their knowledge of their roles in assist-\ning terrorism. Therefore, moving to amend after dis-\nmissal in this case\u2014or accepting the district court\u2019s in-\nvitations to amend, such as during oral argument \nwhere BLOM demanded \u201cdirect allegation[s]\u201d of its \nknowledge, Pet.App.131\u2014would have been pointless. \nAnd while the Second Circuit also ultimately found \nPlaintiffs\u2019 allegations of BLOM\u2019s knowledge of the \nThree Customers\u2019 Hamas affiliations insufficient, it \ndid so for reasons that could be remedied by replead-\ning\u2014such as by pleading more allegations of (1) \u201cpub-\nlic sources\u201d demonstrating that Israeli terrorism des-\nignations were made public, (2) banks\u2019 policies for \nmonitoring counterparties, and (3) the untraceable na-\nture of cash. None of those grounds required alleging \n\n \n \n \n \n \n11 \n \nBLOM\u2019s internal communications or deliberations at \nthe pleading stage showing that BLOM \u201cread or was \naware\u201d of such sources.  \nPlaintiffs timely appealed the district court\u2019s dis-\nmissal decision. Because Kaplan I was also on appeal, \nthe Second Circuit held Honickman in abeyance and \ndirected the parties to submit supplemental briefs on \nthe \u201cissue of how [Kaplan] applies to this case,\u201d once \ndecided. JA.257-258. The circuit subsequently issued \nKaplan II, vacating Kaplan I\u2019s dismissal of JASTA aid-\ning and abetting claims against LCB. See 999 F.3d \n842. Kaplan II largely clarified the standards for \nJASTA liability, as Plaintiffs explained in their sup-\nplemental brief. JA.259-281. BLOM, however, argued \nthat Kaplan II somehow \u201cunderscore[d] the soundness \nof the District Court\u2019s legal analysis,\u201d despite vacating \nits primary support\u2014Kaplan I. JA.294. The circuit \nthen issued its first decision in Honickman on July 29, \n2021 (\u201cHonickman II\u201d). \nIV. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s Assessment of the Dis-\ntrict Court\u2019s Dismissal Decision  \nThe Second Circuit \u201cagree[d]\u201d with Plaintiffs \u201cthat \nthe [district] court did not apply the proper standard \n. . . .\u201d Pet.App.24. Specifically, the circuit rejected \nevery standard the district court applied as grounds \nfor dismissal, including the direct-evidence standard \nfor alleging BLOM\u2019s knowledge of the Three Custom-\ners\u2019 affiliations with Hamas. It also rejected the dis-\ntrict court\u2019s standards for alleging the general aware-\nness and substantial assistance elements, which to-\ngether \u201cform the crux of most JASTA aiding-and-abet-\nting cases.\u201d Pet.App.37. These holdings are detailed \nbelow. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n12 \n \nBLOM \nlargely \nignores \nthese \nholdings. \nSee \nPet.Br.40. But the district court was more forthcom-\ning\u2014it acknowledged that the circuit court only af-\nfirmed on \u201cother grounds.\u201d Pet.App.10. BLOM also \ntries to rehabilitate the district court\u2019s dismissal order \nby suggesting it conforms to this Court\u2019s analysis in \nTaamneh. See Pet.Br.6-7, 8 n.2. But, of course, \nTaamneh affirmed the foreseeability standard from \nHalberstam\u2014the Honickman district court, \u201chowever, \nrejected the foreseeability principle.\u201d Pet.App.39.  \nMoreover, Taamneh had not been issued when \nPlaintiffs sought post-judgment amendment to meet \nthe Second Circuit\u2019s \u201cclarifications\u201d in Kaplan II and \nHonickman II. The issue in this case is the standard \nfor post-judgment amendment where a district court \nhas misapplied controlling law\u2014that is, the law of the \ncircuit. And even if Taamneh had completely repudi-\nated the Second Circuit\u2019s interpretation of JASTA, \nthat would only have provided a further reason to af-\nford Plaintiffs an opportunity to meet this Court\u2019s \nnewly-articulated standard. \nA. The District Court Applied the Wrong \nStandard for Pleading Knowledge \nThe most decisive problem with the district court\u2019s \ndismissal decision was its articulated standard for \npleading knowledge, which required Plaintiffs to al-\nlege \u201cacts or statements by BLOM or BLOM\u2019s employ-\nees\u201d showing their knowledge. Pet.App.73. The Second \nCircuit explained why this standard was incorrect:  \nIn assessing this element, the district court \nfound that the complaint\u2019s references to media \narticles and publications on the Three Custom-\ners\u2019 connection to Hamas were insufficient be-\ncause \u201cPlaintiffs fail[ed] plausibly to allege that \n\n \n \n \n \n \n13 \n \nBLOM [Bank] . . . actually knew or should have \nknown of any of the cited sources.\u201d However, as \nwe explained in Kaplan [II], Plaintiffs did not \nneed to allege that BLOM Bank knew or should \nhave known of the public sources at the plead-\ning stage. Such a requirement at this juncture \nwould be too exacting. \nPet.App.49 (citations omitted). \nThe district court had adopted its erroneous stand-\nard from Kaplan I, before it was vacated in relevant \npart. In Kaplan II, the circuit explained that \u201c[a] com-\nplaint is allowed to contain general allegations as to a \ndefendant\u2019s knowledge because \u2018a plaintiff realistically \ncannot be expected to plead a defendant\u2019s actual state \nof mind,\u2019\u201d although plaintiffs must \u201cinclude allegations \nof the facts or events they claim give rise to an infer-\nence of knowledge.\u201d 999 F.3d at 864 (citations omit-\nted). Moreover, the district court must \u201cconsider all of \nthe complaint\u2019s allegations, rather than considering \neach in isolation, and to accept as true all permissible \ninferences that could be drawn from the complaint as \na whole.\u201d Id. at 865.1  \nThis correction is critical. While Plaintiffs\u2019 pro-\nposed amended complaint submitted in support of \n \n1  \nThe Honickman district court also echoed Kaplan I in \npointing out that with one exception cited in the complaint, the \nU.S. did not designate the Three Customers or their counterpar-\nties as SDGTs until after the transfers at issue (although Israel \nhad designated several of the counterparties as terrorist organi-\nzations years before). See Pet.App.74-75. The circuit rejected this \nstandard in Kaplan II as well, writing: \u201cThe [Kaplan I] court cited \nno authority for such a prerequisite for knowledge, and we know \nof none; and it would defy common sense to hold that such \nknowledge could be gained in no other way.\u201d 999 F.3d at 864. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n14 \n \ntheir vacatur motion contained numerous additional \n\u201cpublic source\u201d allegations (including publications in \nEnglish, French and Arabic) to further support the \n\u201cpermissible inferences\u201d of BLOM\u2019s contemporaneous \nknowledge that it was providing substantial assis-\ntance to Hamas, JA.315-508, those allegations would \nnot satisfy Kaplan I\u2019s \u201cread or was aware of\u201d require-\nment adopted by the district court below. \nB. The District Court Applied the Wrong \nJASTA Standards \nThe Second Circuit also explained that the district \ncourt applied the wrong standards for assessing the \nJASTA elements.  \nAs to general awareness, the Second Circuit first \nset forth the standard given in Halberstam and \nacknowledged in Linde: \u201c[t]he defendant need not be \ngenerally aware of its role in the specific act that \ncaused the plaintiff\u2019s injury; instead, it must be gener-\nally aware of its role in an overall illegal activity from \nwhich the act that caused the plaintiff\u2019s injury was \nforeseeable.\u201d Pet.App.37 (citing Halberstam, 705 F.2d \nat 477, 488). It then explained that the district court \ndid not apply this standard:  \nThe district court, however, rejected the foresee-\nability principle, holding that \u201cit is not enough \nfor Plaintiffs to plausibl[y] allege that BLOM \n[Bank] was generally aware of [its] role in ter-\nrorist activities, from which terrorist attacks \nwere a natural and foreseeable consequence.\u201d \nThe court\u2019s conclusion contravenes both Hal-\nberstam and Linde[], one of the first cases in \nwhich we interpreted aiding-and-abetting lia-\nbility under JASTA. \nPet.App.39 (quoting Pet.App.71-72).  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n15 \n \nIn Taamneh, this Court likewise confirmed that:  \nAs Halberstam makes clear, people who aid and \nabet a tort can be held liable for other torts that \nwere \u201ca foreseeable risk\u201d of the intended \ntort. Accordingly, a close nexus between the as-\nsistance and the tort might help establish that \nthe defendant aided and abetted the tort, but \neven more remote support can still constitute \naiding and abetting in the right case. \n598 U.S. at 496 (quoting Halberstam, 705 F.2d at 488). \nThe Second Circuit rejected BLOM\u2019s argument \nthat providing indirect assistance changes the stand-\nard for pleading knowledge, explaining that \u201cKaplan \n[II] did not so hold; instead, it asserted \u2018the actual \nknowledge component of the Halberstam standard re-\nquires that the defendant \u201cknow[ ]\u201d that it is providing \n\u201cassistance,\u201d . . . whether directly to the FTO or indi-\nrectly through an intermediary.\u2019\u201d Pet.App.46 n.16 \n(quoting Kaplan II, 999 F.3d at 863-64). See also \nPet.App.45 n.15 (rejecting BLOM\u2019s argument regard-\ning customer activities).  \nThe circuit\u2019s Honickman II and Kaplan II decisions \nalso rejected the district court\u2019s assertion that \u201cthe \nmere provision of routine banking services to an FTO \ndoes not render a bank liable for civil aiding and abet-\nting.\u201d Pet.App.71. The Kaplan II court explained that \nso-called \u201croutine\u201d services could suffice depending on \nthe circumstances, and that, under Linde, \u201cwhether a \ndefendant bank\u2019s \u2018financial services to [an FTO or its \naffiliates should or] should not be viewed as routine\u2019 is \na \u2018question[] of fact for a jury to decide.\u2019\u201d 999 F.3d at \n858 (quoting Linde, 882 F.3d at 327) (alterations orig-\ninal to Kaplan II). See also Taamneh, 598 U.S. at 502 \n(noting circumstances \u201cwhere the provider of routine \n\n \n \n \n \n \n16 \n \nservices\u201d could be liable for \u201caiding and abetting a fore-\nseeable terror attack\u201d). \nThe Second Circuit also found that the district \ncourt applied incorrect standards to plead the knowing \nand substantial assistance element. This included \nmisapprehending the \u201cknowing\u201d prong under circuit \nlaw2 and misapplying each of the Halberstam substan-\ntial assistance factors it analyzed. Pet.App.45.  \nThe district court \u201cmisunderstood the first factor, \n\u2018the nature of the act encouraged,\u2019 to be a question of \nwhether Plaintiffs plausibly alleged \u2018that BLOM \n[Bank] knowingly encouraged Hamas\u2019[s] violent activ-\nities, such as those which caused Plaintiffs\u2019 injuries.\u2019\u201d \nPet.App.46. Indeed, the Halberstam defendant did not \n\u201cencourage\u201d her burglar boyfriend to commit the un-\nplanned murder of Dr. Halberstam, of which she had \nno knowledge.  \nThe district court also applied too exacting a stand-\nard for \u201cthe second factor, \u2018the amount of assistance,\u2019\u201d \nrequiring allegations of how the money BLOM moved \nfor Hamas actually made it through the FTO\u2019s fronts. \nTo the contrary, \u201c[f]actual allegations that permit a \nreasonable inference that the defendant recognized \nthe money it transferred to its customers would be re-\nceived by the FTO would suffice.\u201d Pet.App.47. \n \n2  \nThe Second Circuit did not, as some JASTA defendants \nhave suggested, \u201canalyze[] the \u2018knowing\u2019 subelement as a carbon \ncopy of the antecedent element of whether the defendants were \n\u2018generally aware\u2019 of their role in ISIS\u2019 overall scheme.\u201d Taamneh, \n598 U.S. at 503 (citations omitted). It only observed that the same \nfacts could satisfy both mental state elements: \u201cFor instance, Hal-\nberstam . . . . did not require [the defendant] to \u2018know\u2019 anything \nmore about [the murderer\u2019s] unlawful activities than what she \nknew for the general awareness element.\u201d Pet.App.46.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n17 \n \nFinally, under the fourth factor, the defendant\u2019s re-\nlation to the principal, \u201c[t]he district court erroneously \nconstrued\u201d Second Circuit precedent \u201cto mean that \nPlaintiffs must plead a direct relationship between \nBLOM Bank and Hamas.\u201d Pet.App.47-48. A less direct \nrelationship, depending on the circumstances, could \nsuffice. \nAgain, these errors align with BLOM\u2019s \u201cargu-\nments\u201d and \u201ccontentions\u201d to which the district court \ninvited Plaintiffs to respond by amendment. JA.156, \nPet.App.125. Plaintiffs reasonably declined these invi-\ntations, as evidenced by the Second Circuit\u2019s complete \nrejection of them. \nC. The Second Circuit Affirmed the District \nCourt Decision Only on Another Ground \nThe Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal decision \nentirely on one ground: \u201cWe conclude that Plaintiffs\u2019 \naiding-and-abetting claim fails because the allegations \ndo not support an inference that BLOM Bank was \naware of the Three Customers\u2019 ties with Hamas prior \nto the relevant attacks, thereby undermining the sec-\nond element of general awareness.\u201d Pet.App.49. But \nwhereas the district court required allegations of \u201cacts \nor statements\u201d from \u201cBLOM employees\u201d demonstrat-\ning their actual knowledge (which Plaintiffs naturally \ndid not have before discovery), the Second Circuit \nidentified a less exacting set of specific and remediable \ndeficiencies in the complaint\u2019s knowledge allegations. \nChief among these was the circuit\u2019s finding that \nPlaintiffs\u2019 evidence of the Three Customers\u2019 Hamas af-\nfiliations was \u201cpublicly available,\u201d rather than from \n\u201cpublic sources\u201d: \nHowever, \u201cpublicly available\u201d evidence is not \nthe same as public sources such as media \n\n \n \n \n \n \n18 \n \narticles. The latter, depending on their sub-\nstance, \nplausibly \nsuggest \na \ndefendant\u2019s \nknowledge which can be confirmed during dis-\ncovery, whereas the former requires the implau-\nsible inference that the defendant was aware of \nthose facts even before the news media. \nPet.App.50 n.18. The court then went on to find Plain-\ntiffs\u2019 allegations of \u201cpublic sources\u201d too \u201climited\u201d in de-\ntail and numerosity. Pet.App.51. \nPlaintiffs understandably did not anticipate this \nnew evidentiary distinction (the district court cer-\ntainly did not). Moreover, the Second Circuit did not \ncite any precedent for this position, and it is by all ap-\npearances a newly articulated distinction. Nor did the \nKaplan II decision mention any distinction between \n\u201cpublicly available evidence\u201d and \u201cpublic sources\u201d of \nevidence. In fact, \u201cpublicly available evidence\u201d echoes \nthe term the Second Circuit had previously used as a \nbasis for inferring knowledge, relying on this Court\u2019s \nprecedent: \u201cPublicly available information may pro-\nvide relevant circumstantial evidence of actual \nknowledge.\u201d Fed. Hous. Fin. Agency v. Nomura Hold-\ning Am., Inc., 873 F.3d 85, 122 (2d Cir. 2017) (empha-\nsis added) (citing Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa, 539 U.S. \n90, 100 (2003)). Indeed, it seems reasonable that \nbanks, given their unique Know-Your-Customer obli-\ngations and due diligence policies, which assume close \nmonitoring of customer accounts and transactions, \nwould know facts about their customers \u201cbefore the \nnews media\u201d report it (which involves deciding what is \nnewsworthy and what facts are verifiable).  \nBut no matter\u2014Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed amended com-\nplaint included numerous and detailed allegations of \ncontemporaneous \u201cpublic sources\u201d to meet the Second \nCircuit\u2019s requirement.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n19 \n \nThe other defects the circuit identified were also re-\nmediable. For example, the circuit discounted Plain-\ntiffs\u2019 assertion that BLOM must have noticed that the \nThree Customers were receiving funds from desig-\nnated terrorist entities. The circuit noted that the com-\nplaint alleged that Sanabil received transfers from the \n\u201cAl-Aqsa Foundation\u201d after Israel designated it as a \nterrorist organization, but not \u201cwhether and where \nthis [designation] was made public.\u201d Pet.App.52 n.20. \nThe circuit also noted that the complaint needed \u201cfur-\nther allegations\u201d to show that a defendant-bank would \nknow about \u201ctransfers of funds from non-customers as-\nsociated with an FTO to the defendant\u2019s customers.\u201d \nId.  \nThese defects were not due to unreasonable draft-\ning\u2014previous ATA decisions found it reasonable to in-\nfer that a foreign bank would \u201cmonitor publicly avail-\nable information,\u201d including \u201cIsraeli lists of terrorists.\u201d \nWeiss v. Nat\u2019l Westminster Bank PLC, 453 F. Supp. \n2d 609, 627 (E.D.N.Y. 2006) (emphasis added). But the \nproposed amended complaint now includes media re-\nports on the relevant Israeli designations and BLOM\u2019s \nown customer due diligence procedures, such as moni-\ntoring transfer counterparties and non-profit organi-\nzations, which are often used as terror fronts.  \nSimilarly, although Plaintiffs repeatedly empha-\nsized the suspicious nature of Sanabil making large \ncash withdrawals from its BLOM account, the circuit \nsuggesting that the complaint should more explicitly \nallege that cash is \u201cuntraceable.\u201d Pet.App.51 n.19. Alt-\nhough Plaintiffs took that characteristic of cash to be \na reasonable inference rather than a necessary allega-\ntion, they included those explicit allegations in the \nproposed amended complaint. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n20 \n \nV. \nPlaintiffs\u2019 Motion to Vacate and Amend and \nthe Second Appeal \nAs the Second Circuit explained in the summary \norder below, the district court had applied the \u201cwrong \nlegal standards\u201d in dismissing the complaint, so once \n\u201c[a]rmed with this Court\u2019s clarifications, Plaintiffs re-\nturned to the district court,\u201d promptly moving (11 days \nafter Honickman II issued\u2014in fact, before the man-\ndate issued) under Rules 60(b)(6) and 15(a)(2) to va-\ncate the judgment of dismissal and grant them leave \nto file a first amended complaint. JA.315. The district \ncourt denied the motion, concluding that Plaintiffs \nfailed to show extraordinary circumstances chiefly be-\ncause they declined the district court\u2019s two prior invi-\ntations to meet the erroneous and largely impossible \npleading standard BLOM urged and that the district \ncourt erroneously adopted.  \nPlaintiffs again appealed. During argument, Cir-\ncuit Court Judge Wesley\u2014who also authored Honick-\nman II\u2014noted the case constituted an \u201cunusual cir-\ncumstance,\u201d 10/5/2023 Oral Arg. at 3:40, and \u201ca curi-\nous situation,\u201d id. at 10:54, and was \u201cquirky,\u201d id. at \n18:07. And as he recognized, Plaintiffs faced \u201ca wrong \nstandard\u201d \u201cthat\u2019s even harder for them to meet.\u201d Judge \nWesley observed: \u201cWhat are they supposed to do? They \nknow they can\u2019t amend [to] . . . meet that\u201d standard. \nId. at 11:50-56. The dismissal was \u201c[a]ffirmed for a dif-\nferent reason,\u201d as a result of a series of cases \u201cwhere \nthe law was really recasting itself.\u201d Id. at 13:12-38. \nAfter that oral argument in this case, the Second \nCircuit decided Mandala, another \u201cone of the excep-\ntional cases necessitating relief from judgment.\u201d Man-\ndala, 88 F.4th at 365. In Mandala, the plaintiffs \nbrought a putative class action alleging that defendant \nNTT Data\u2019s policy of not hiring people with felony \n\n \n \n \n \n \n21 \n \nconvictions disproportionately harms Black appli-\ncants. See id. at 357. The plaintiffs cited government \nreports showing \u201cBlack people are arrested and incar-\ncerated at higher rates than others.\u201d Id. The district \ncourt dismissed the complaint because it did not show \nthat there was a similar disparity among Black appli-\ncants for NTT\u2019s positions specifically.  \nThe Second Circuit affirmed, \u201cagree[ing] with the \ndistrict court\u201d that the complaint\u2019s statistics did not \nfocus on \u201cappropriate comparator groups.\u201d Id. at 357-\n58 (citation omitted). However, the circuit recognized \n\u201cthat such granular data may be impossible to collect \nwithout discovery,\u201d and that \u201cthe Complaint might \nhave survived dismissal if it had contained allegations \nexplaining \u2018why their chosen national statistics are in \nfact likely to be representative of NTT\u2019s qualified ap-\nplicant pool.\u2019\u201d Id. at 358 (citation omitted). The plain-\ntiffs petitioned for rehearing en banc, and although it \nwas denied, the dissenting judges urged the plaintiffs \nto move for vacatur and leave to amend. The plaintiffs \ndid, and the district court denied the motion.  \nOn appeal, the second Mandala panel acknowl-\nedged that \u201c[i]t wasn\u2019t until this Court\u2019s decision on \nappeal that it became clear what other types of infor-\nmation might suffice at the pleading stage.\u201d Id. at 365. \nAs a result, the panel vacated that denial and re-\nmanded the motion for reconsideration given Foman, \nthe Second Circuit cases Metzler and Williams, and \nother precedents.  \nRecognizing that its \u201cdiscussion of the various con-\nsiderations in Mandala will be particularly helpful to \nthe district court\u2019s analysis\u201d of Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for \nvacatur and leave to amend, the Second Circuit issued \nthe summary order below, likewise citing Foman and \nMetzler. Pet.App.1-8. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n22 \n \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n1. Second Circuit precedent does not meaningfully \ndiffer from other circuits\u2019 post-judgment amendment \nholdings. The summary order below does not \u201chold\u201d \nanything, and the precedents it cites are typical of \nRule 60(b)(6) cases. For example, they uncontrover-\nsially hold that \u201c[r]elief under Rule 60(b)(6) is reserved \nfor cases that present \u2018extraordinary circumstances.\u2019\u201d \nMandala, 88 F.4th at 361 (quoting Liljeberg v. Health \nServs. Acquisition Corp., 486 U.S. 847, 863 (1988)).  \nThis case involves highly exceptional circum-\nstances. The district court applied erroneous stand-\nards for pleading aiding and abetting under JASTA, \nincluding a knowledge pleading standard that was all \nbut impossible to meet. Pet.App.5, 49. Plaintiffs rea-\nsonably declined the district court\u2019s invitation to \namend to meet those erroneous standards. The Second \nCircuit \u201cagree[d]\u201d that those standards were incorrect, \nbut found the complaint did not meet the standards it \n\u201cclarified\u201d on appeal. Pet.App.25, 40 n.11. After the \ndistrict court refused to let Plaintiffs amend their com-\nplaint to meet the clarified standard, the Second Cir-\ncuit directed it to reconsider, given prior precedents. It \ndid not dictate a particular outcome.  \n2. The balancing test the circuit court described is \nalso typical of Rule 60(b)(6) cases. The Second Circuit \nrejects allowing the \u201cliberal amendment policy of Rule \n15(a) to swallow the philosophy favoring finality of \njudgments whole.\u201d Metzler, 970 F.3d at 146 (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted). Rather, the \ntest balances Rule 60(b)\u2019s value of finality \u201cwith the \npreference expressed in the Federal Rules of Civil Pro-\ncedure in general, and Rule 15 in particular, for resolv-\ning disputes on their merits.\u201d Krupski, 560 U.S. at \n550. After all, \u201cthe \u2018whole purpose\u2019 of Rule 60(b) \u2018is to \n\n \n \n \n \n \n23 \n \nmake an exception to finality.\u2019\u201d Buck v. Davis, 580 U.S. \n100, 126 (2017) (citations omitted). \nThe practical effect of that balance is far more mod-\nest than BLOM suggests: \u201cIn the post-judgment con-\ntext, we have indeed given \u2018due regard\u2019 to \u2018the liberal \nspirit of Rule 15\u2019 by ensuring plaintiffs at least one op-\nportunity to replead.\u201d Metzler, 970 F.3d at 146 (quot-\ning Williams, 659 F.3d at 213-14). See also Mandala, \n88 F.4th at 362 (same). Courts regularly recognize the \nimportance of providing plaintiffs an opportunity to \namend their complaints once apprised of actual defects \nin them. Where the dismissal standards are wrong, \nhowever, \u201cthe proper recourse\u201d is an appeal, United \nStates v. Mask of Ka-Nefer-Nefer, 752 F.3d 737, 743 \n(8th Cir. 2014), which Plaintiffs here took. None of \nBLOM\u2019s cited cases suggest that under the circum-\nstances present here Plaintiffs would not be entitled to \namend. \n3. BLOM\u2019s appeal is premised on the unsupported \ninference that the Second Circuit agreed that Plain-\ntiffs \u201cwaived\u201d their opportunities to amend but then \n\u201cdirected district courts to override and rescue parties \nfrom their \u2018free, calculated, [and] deliberate choices.\u2019\u201d \nPet.Br.28-29. But the Second Circuit did not find any \nwaiver. Quite the opposite, it suggested Plaintiffs rea-\nsonably appealed the district court\u2019s dismissal deci-\nsion and never received a meaningful opportunity to \nmeet the correct and newly clarified standards\u2014and \nthus had nothing to waive.  \nBLOM\u2019s litany of \u201cwaived\u201d opportunities to amend \nare not supported by the record and in any event were \nnot accepted by the panel below in discussing post-\njudgment amendment standards. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n24 \n \n4. The Second Circuit\u2019s precedents do not conflict \nwith the text of Rule 60(b) or Rule 15(a). The Second \nCircuit requires determining which Rule 60(b) provi-\nsion applies as a \u201cthreshold issue,\u201d before considering \namendment. Mandala, 88 F.4th at 359. The desire to \namend a complaint itself is insufficient. \n5. Extraordinary circumstances are clearly present \nhere, for the reasons stated above. Plaintiffs were not \nafforded a meaningful opportunity to address actual \ndefects in their complaint. They properly appealed the \ndistrict court\u2019s erroneous decision and then promptly \nsought vacatur to meet the clarified standards the cir-\ncuit issued on appeal. Discovery has not even com-\nmenced\u2014this case is in its infancy, and Plaintiffs \nshould have the opportunity to have their case adjudi-\ncated on the merits. \nARGUMENT  \nI. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s Analysis Is Consistent \nwith Post-Judgment Amendment Jurispru-\ndence Nationally. \nBLOM asserts that the summary order below \n\u201cabandons the \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 standard \nin favor of a nebulous \u2018balanc[ing]\u2019 inquiry that pits \nRule 60(b)(6)\u2019s protection of \u2018finality\u2019 against \u2018Rule \n15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policies.\u2019\u201d Pet.Br.25 (quot-\ning Pet.App.8). This is inaccurate.  \nFirst, as Respondent acknowledges, the decision \nbelow is a non-precedential summary order which \nmerely \u201c[r]el[ies] on a series of Second Circuit prece-\ndents.\u201d Pet.Br.20. In fact, the order only cites three de-\ncisions on post-judgment amendment\u2014Mandala and \nMetzler from the Second Circuit, and Foman v. Davis, \n371 U.S. 178 (1962), from this Court.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n25 \n \nSecond, these decisions are not erroneous and cer-\ntainly do not \u201cjettison\u201d the extraordinary circum-\nstances standard, as BLOM claims. Pet.Br.14. Man-\ndala holds that \u201c[r]elief under Rule 60(b)(6) is reserved \nfor cases that present \u2018extraordinary circumstances.\u2019\u201d \n88 F.4th at 361 (quoting Liljeberg, 486 U.S. at 863). \nAnd in Metzler, the Second Circuit affirmed denial of \npost-judgment amendment because \u201cthe plaintiffs-ap-\npellants fail[ed] to identify any \u2018extraordinary circum-\nstances\u2019 that would \u2018justify[] relief\u2019 under Rule \n60(b)(6).\u201d 970 F.3d at 147. \nAs explained below, the \u201cextraordinary circum-\nstances\u201d here are clear. This case is, as Judge Wesley \nput it, \u201cunusual,\u201d \u201cquirky,\u201d and \u201ccurious,\u201d appearing to \ndeny Plaintiffs even a single meaningful opportunity \nto amend. The Second Circuit therefore directed the \ndistrict court to reconsider its denial of vacatur given \nthe standards in Mandala and Metzler. As this re-\nmand reflected, Rule 60(b)(6) motions inherently re-\nquire \u201ccase-by-case inquiry,\u201d Stokes v. Williams, 475 \nF.3d 732, 736 (6th Cir. 2007)). Indeed, even if this \nCourt wanted to revisit its jurisprudence on Rule \n60(b), it is difficult to imagine it being able to fashion \nany generally applicable standard based on the \u201cunu-\nsual\u201d procedural history of this case. \nA. Rule 60(b)(6) Jurisprudence Balances Fi-\nnality and the Preference for Deciding \nCases on Their Merits. \nMandala and Metzler both apply the balancing test \narticulated in Williams v. Citigroup: \u201cpostjudgment \nmotions for leave to replead must be evaluated with \ndue regard to both the value of finality and the policies \nembodied in Rule 15.\u201d 659 F.3d at 213. Finality thus \nremains the starting point for applying Rule 60(b)(6) \nin the Second Circuit: \u201c[t]he standards we have \n\n \n \n \n \n \n26 \n \ndeveloped for evaluating postjudgment motions gener-\nally place significant emphasis on the \u2018value of finality \nand repose.\u2019\u201d Id. (citation omitted). The circuit notes \nthat \u2018\u201c[t]o hold otherwise would enable the liberal \namendment policy of Rule 15(a) to be employed in a \nway that is contrary to the philosophy favoring finality \nof judgments and the expeditious termination of liti-\ngation.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Nat\u2019l Petrochemical Co. v. M/T \nStolt Sheaf, 930 F.2d 240, 245 (2d Cir. 1991)). \nFinality is then balanced with Rule 15(a)\u2019s prefer-\nence for resolving cases on their merits, which the Wil-\nliams panel sourced from this Court\u2019s \u201c[p]articularly \ninstructive\u201d Foman decision. 695 F.3d at 213. Foman \nheld that the district court abused its discretion in \ndenying a motion to vacate the judgment in order to \namend the complaint:  \nRule 15(a) declares that leave to amend \u201cshall \nbe freely given when justice so requires\u201d; this \nmandate is to be heeded. See generally, 3 \nMoore, Federal Practice (2d ed. 1948), paras. \n15.08, 15.10. If the underlying facts or circum-\nstances relied upon by a plaintiff may be a \nproper subject of relief, he ought to be afforded \nan opportunity to test his claim on the mer-\nits. In the absence of any apparent or declared \nreason \u2014 such as undue delay, bad faith or di-\nlatory motive on the part of the movant, re-\npeated failure to cure deficiencies by amend-\nments previously allowed, undue prejudice to \nthe opposing party by virtue of allowance of the \namendment, futility of amendment, etc. \u2014 the \nleave sought should, as the rules require, be \n\u201cfreely given.\u201d Of course, the grant or denial of \nan opportunity to amend is within the discre-\ntion of the District Court, but outright refusal to \n\n \n \n \n \n \n27 \n \ngrant the leave without any justifying reason \nappearing for the denial is not an exercise of dis-\ncretion; it is merely abuse of that discretion and \ninconsistent with the spirit of the Federal \nRules. \n371 U.S. at 182.3 See, e.g., United States v. Vorachek, \n563 F.2d 884, 887 (8th Cir. 1977) (vacatur necessary \ngiven Foman and Rule 15(a)).  \nThis Court has always balanced the finality of judg-\nments with the preference for giving plaintiffs \u201can op-\nportunity to test their claims on the merits.\u201d For ex-\nample, this Court \u201cbalance[d] the interests of the de-\nfendant protected by the statute of limitations with \nthe preference expressed in the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure in general, and Rule 15 in particular, for re-\nsolving disputes on their merits.\u201d Krupski, 560 U.S. at \n550. A statute of limitations embodies the value of fi-\nnality and repose, see, e.g., Lozano v. Alvarez, 572 U.S. \n1, 14 (2014), just as, in the Second Circuit, \u201cpostjudg-\nment motions generally place significant emphasis on \n \n3  \nBLOM argues that the circuit erred in relying on Foman \nbecause the vacatur motion in that case was treated as coming \nunder Rule 59(e), not Rule 60(b), and the two rules \u201cdiffer in ma-\nterial ways and impose different standards for relief by their own \nterms.\u201d Pet.Br.18, 34-35. As explained infra 31-32, any such dis-\ntinction does not help BLOM\u2014but it was also completely irrele-\nvant to this Court\u2019s analysis in Foman. The First Circuit had de-\ncided to treat the motion as \u201cfiled pursuant to Rule 59(e), rather \nthan under Rule 60(b)\u201d to resolve an unrelated procedural issue \ninvolving two notices of appeal. Foman v. Davis, 292 F.2d 85, 87 \n(1st Cir. 1961). This Court then noted that the \u201cCourt of Appeals\u2019 \ntreatment of the motion to vacate as one under Rule 59(e) was \npermissible, at least as an original matter, and we will accept \nthat characterization here.\u201d 371 U.S. at 181. It never suggested \nthat the \u201ccharacterization\u201d impacted its review or the vacatur \nstandards it applied.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n28 \n \nthe \u2018value of finality and repose,\u2019\u201d Williams, 659 F.3d \nat 213 (internal citation omitted).  \nThis Court has also always understood Rule 60(b) \nas accommodating that preference, rejecting argu-\nments that overemphasize finality at its expense. For \nexample: \u201c[T]he State reminds us of the importance of \npreserving the finality of judgments. But the \u2018whole \npurpose\u2019 of Rule 60(b) \u2018is to make an exception to final-\nity.\u2019\u201d Buck, 580 U.S. at 126 (citations omitted). BLOM \nrelies heavily on this Court\u2019s analysis of finality in \nGonzalez v. Crosby but omits its conclusion: \u201c[W]e give \nlittle weight to respondent\u2019s appeal to the virtues of \nfinality. That policy consideration, standing alone, is \nunpersuasive in the interpretation of a provision \nwhose whole purpose is to make an exception to final-\nity.\u201d 545 U.S. 524, 529 (2005). Likewise, BLOM quotes \nthis Court\u2019s admonition in United States v. Denedo \nthat \u201cjudgment finality is not to be lightly cast aside,\u201d \nPet.Br.27, but again leaves out the Court\u2019s conclusion: \n\u201cthe finality rule is not so inflexible that it trumps each \nand every competing consideration.\u201d 556 U.S. 904, 916 \n(2009). A \u201cjudgment\u201d based on the wrong reasons, due \nlargely to what the circuit itself concedes to have been \nits own \u201cambigu[ous]\u201d precedent, Pet.App.40 n.11, is \nto be \u201ccast aside\u201d in order to permit disposition on the \nmerits.  \nLike this Court, the Second Circuit rejects \u201ca stand-\nard that overemphasize[s] considerations of finality at \nthe expense of the liberal amendment policy embodied \nin the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\u201d Williams, 659 \nF.3d at 210. And like this Court, the Second Circuit \nholds that \u201cRule 60(b) relief is designed to afford par-\nties an opportunity to resolve a dispute on its merits.\u201d \nNemaizer v. Baker, 793 F.2d 58, 63 (2d Cir. 1986) (cit-\ning 7 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, \u00b6 60.19, at 156 (2d ed. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n29 \n \n1983)). That is, the policies underlying Rules 60(b) and \n15(a) work \u201cin tandem,\u201d as the Second Circuit ex-\nplained below. Pet.App.7. \nThe circuit courts have also consistently recognized \nthis balance inherent in Rule 60(b)(6). The rule\u2019s \u201c[ex-\ntraordinary circumstances] requirement exists in or-\nder to balance the broad language of Rule 60(b)(6), \nwhich allows courts to set aside judgments for \u2018any\u2019 \nreason justifying relief, with the interest in the finality \nof judgments.\u201d Budget Blinds, 536 F.3d at 255. The \nNinth Circuit sourced this principle to Gonzalez:  \nAs the Sixth Circuit rightly held when applying \nGonzalez, \u201cthe decision to grant Rule 60(b)(6) \nrelief is a case-by-case inquiry that requires the \ntrial court to intensively balance numerous fac-\ntors, including the competing policies of the fi-\nnality of judgments and the incessant command \nof the court\u2019s conscience that justice be done in \nlight of all the facts.\u201d  \nPhelps v. Alameida, 569 F.3d 1120, 1133 (9th Cir. \n2009) (quoting Stokes, 475 F.3d at 736). See also In re \nSpansion, Inc., 507 F. App\u2019x 125, 128 (3d Cir. 2012) \n(\u201cThe rule seeks \u2018to strike a proper balance between \nthe conflicting principles that litigation must be \nbrought to an end and that justice must be done.\u2019\u201d) (ci-\ntation omitted); Blue Diamond Coal Co. v. Trs. of the \nUMWA Combined Benefit Fund, 249 F.3d 519, 529 \n(6th Cir. 2001) (same); People for the Ethical Treat-\nment of Animals v. United States HHS, 901 F.3d 343, \n354-55 (D.C.

Miller & M.K. \nKane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2851 (2d ed. \n1995) (same). \nThe Eighth Circuit has held that district courts re-\nviewing post-judgment motions to amend under Rule \n59(e) or Rule 60(b) \u2018\u201cmay not ignore the Rule 15(a)(2) \nconsiderations that favor affording parties an oppor-\ntunity to test their claims on the merits . . . .\u2019\u201d Mask of \nKa-Nefer-Nefer, 752 F.3d at 743 (quoting United \nStates ex rel. Roop v. Hypoguard USA, Inc., 559 F.3d \n818, 823-24 (8th Cir. 2009)). Indeed, Moore\u2019s Federal \nPractice specifically notes that \u201c[t]he hybrid approach \nof the Second and Eighth Circuits strikes the correct \nbalance: it protects the strong interest in finality of \njudgments and the expeditious termination of litiga-\ntion, while allowing postjudgment amendment of \npleadings in a particular case if justice requires.\u201d 12 \nMoore\u2019s Federal Practice - Civil \u00a7 59.30. For that prop-\nosition, Moore\u2019s relies on two Rule 60(b)(6) cases\u2014Wil-\nliams and Mask of Ka-Nefer-Nefer. Id., \u00a7 59.30 n.9.1.3, \nn.9.1.4. \nThe Seventh Circuit gives even greater weight to \nRule 15 interests when the district court has entered \njudgment at the same time it dismisses a complaint: \nBecause Rules 59(e) and 60(b) are reserved for \nextraordinary cases, the Girl Scouts urge us to \napply a more demanding standard to post-judg-\nment motions to amend than we do to motions \nto amend filed prior to the entry of judgment. \n \n4  \nThe same is true for Rule 59(e), in which \u201c[t]he court must \nstrike the proper balance between two competing imperatives: (1) \nfinality, and (2) the need to render just decisions on the basis of \nall the facts.\u201d Edward H. Bohlin Co. v. Banning Co., 6 F.3d 350, \n355 (5th Cir. 1993). \n\n \n \n \n \n \n31 \n \nBut the extraordinary nature of these remedies \ndoes not mean that a different standard ap-\nplies\u2014at least when judgment was entered at \nthe same time the case was first dismissed. \nWhen the district court has taken the unusual \nstep of entering judgment at the same time it \ndismisses the complaint, the court need not find \nother extraordinary circumstances and must \nstill apply the liberal standard for amending \npleadings under Rule 15(a). \nRunnion v. Girl Scouts of Greater Chi. & Nw. Ind., 786 \nF.3d 510, 521 (7th Cir. 2015). See also NewSpin \nSports, Ltd. Liab. Co. v. Arrow Elecs., Inc., 910 F.3d \n293, 310 (7th Cir. 2018) (same). \nBLOM attempts to draw a distinction between \npost-judgment analyses under \u201cRules 59(e) and 60(b),\u201d \nrelying on Daulatzai v. Maryland, 97 F.4th 166 (4th \nCir. 2024). Pet.Br.34-35. But Daulatzai only held that \nunder Rule 59(e), a court should solely \u201capply the more \nspecific standard of Rule 15(a),\u201d and \u201cneed not concern \nitself\u201d with Rule 59(e)\u2019s other standards. 97 F.4th at \n177 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \nSee also Rosenzweig v. Azurix Corp., 332 F.3d 854, 864 \n(5th Cir. 2003) (\u201cthis Court has held that, under these \ncircumstances, the considerations for a Rule 59(e) mo-\ntion are governed by Rule 15(a)\u201d); Jang v. Bos. Sci. \nScimed, Inc., 729 F.3d 357, 368 (3d Cir. 2013) (\u201c[w]here \na timely motion to amend judgment is filed under Rule \n59(e), the Rule 15 and 59 inquiries turn on the same \nfactors.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omit-\nted); Allen v. Walmart Stores, L.L.C., 907 F.3d 170, \n184 (5th Cir. 2018) (same).5 Daulatzai unremarkably \n \n5  \nBLOM relies heavily on Banister v. Davis, 590 U.S. 504 \n(2020), but that case deals with what types of vacatur motions \ncount as a successive habeas application. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n32 \n \nheld that \u201cto obtain relief from a final judgment under \nRule 60(b), one of the six grounds enumerated must be \nsatisfied,\u201d including finding \u201cextraordinary circum-\nstances\u201d under Rule 60(b)(6). 97 F.4th at 178. The \nplaintiff failed to show \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d \nthere because she had already amended twice, and her \namendment \u201cefforts were pursued in bad faith.\u201d Id. at \n170. The extraordinary circumstances requirement is \nthe same in Metzler and Mandala (and in Runnion, \nwhich did find \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d).  \nIn sum, BLOM\u2019s claim that \u201cevery one of [the Sec-\nond Circuit\u2019s] sister Circuits\u201d disagrees with it is \nsimply wrong. Pet.Br.25. A number of BLOM\u2019s own \ncases recognize the need to balance competing policies \nin Rule 60(b). For example, in Leisure Caviar, LLC v. \nUnited States Fish & Wildlife Service, the Sixth Cir-\ncuit explained that while amendment should be \u201cfreely \nallowed,\u201d \u201cwhen a Rule 15 motion comes after a judg-\nment against the plaintiff,\u201d courts \u201cmust \u2018consider[] \nthe competing interest of protecting the finality of \njudgments\u201d; that is, \u201c[i]nstead of meeting only the \nmodest requirements of Rule 15, the claimant must \nmeet the requirements for reopening a case estab-\nlished by Rules 59 or 60.\u201d 616 F.3d 612, 615-16 (6th \nCir. 2010) (citations omitted) (emphases added). Like \nin Phelps, Leisure Caviar directs courts to balance the \n\u201ccompeting\u201d policies of Rule 15 and Rule 60.  \nAnd in Nation v. DOI, the Ninth Circuit explained \nthat \u201c[a]fter judgment . . . \u2018our policy of promoting the \nfinality of judgments\u2019 somewhat displaces Rule 15\u2019s \nopenhandedness,\u201d given Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s predicate of \nextraordinary circumstances. 876 F.3d 1144, 1173 (9th \nCir. 2017) (citation omitted) (emphasis added). That \ncase affirmed denial of post-judgment leave to amend \nbecause the plaintiff had already twice amended and \n\n \n \n \n \n \n33 \n \nfailed to identify how yet another amendment could \ncure its standing problem.  \nMost of BLOM\u2019s remaining cases simply note that \na judgment must be appealed or vacated before a com-\nplaint is amended or that Rule 15(a) does not alone \nprovide the analytical basis for vacatur\u2014but none dis-\npute that the Rule 15 principles could inform the ex-\nceptional circumstances analysis. See Rosenzweig, 332 \nF.3d at 864 (explaining that post-judgment amend-\nment requires appeal or vacatur); In re Ferro Corp. \nDerivative Litig., 511 F.3d 611, 624 (6th Cir. 2008) \n(same); Helm v. Resolution Tr. Corp., 84 F.3d 874, 879 \n(7th Cir. 1996) (same); Bldg. Indus. Ass\u2019n v. Norton, \n247 F.3d 1241, 1245 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (same); Boyd v. \nSecretary, 114 F.4th 1232, 1237 (11th Cir. 2024) \n(same). Indeed, in a case BLOM cites for the proposi-\ntion that \u201cthere is no pending complaint to amend\u201d \nonce \u201cthe action has been dismissed\u201d with prejudice, \nthe opinion noted that courts still apply \u201cRule 15 \nstandards\u201d to such vacatur motions. Calvary Christian \nCenter v. City of Fredericksburg, 710 F.3d 536, 540 \n(4th Cir. 2013). \nTo the extent that any of BLOM\u2019s cases can be read \nto suggest that Rule 15(a)\u2019s preference for determining \ncases on their merits plays no role in motions for post-\njudgment amendment, they are out of step with the \nother circuits. BLOM quotes Garrett v. Wexford \nHealth as holding that under Rule 60(b), \u201c[t]he permis-\nsive policy favoring amendment under Rule 15 was \nsimply not relevant.\u201d 938 F.3d 69, 86 (3d Cir. 2019). \nBut that case cited and relied on Leisure Caviar, 616 \nF.3d at 615-16, which requires courts to weigh the \n\u201ccompeting interests\u201d of Rules 15 and 60. The starker \nlanguage in Garrett was understandable as the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n34 \n \nplaintiff had already amended his complaint four \ntimes, clearly exhausting the policy of liberal amend-\nment.  \nUnsurprisingly, BLOM has selected cases where \nplaintiffs have thoroughly exhausted any chance to \namend. As noted above, Daulatzai involved a motion \nto file a fourth complaint, \u201cpursued in bad faith.\u201d 97 \nF.4th at 170. In James v. Watt, 716 F.2d 71, 77 (1st \nCir. 1983), the delay in amendment was \u201cstrategic.\u201d In \nIn re Ferro, the plaintiff did not have an actual amend-\nment in mind and needed discovery. 511 F.3d at 624. \nSee also Helm, 84 F.3d at 879 (\u201cinexcusable attorney \nnegligence\u201d); UMB Bank, N.A. v. Guerin, 89 F.4th \n1047, 1057-58 (8th Cir. 2024) (proposed second \namended complaint \u201crepeats . . . scandalous, logically \nirrelevant material\u201d and was futile) (internal quota-\ntion marks and citations omitted); Nation, 876 F.3d at \n1174 (plaintiff \u201camended its complaint twice before\u201d \ndismissal).  \nB. Rule 60(b)\u2019s Balancing Means Ensuring \nParties Have a Meaningful Opportunity \nto Amend Pleadings at Least Once, \nWhich Courts Broadly Support. \nIn the Second Circuit, the practical effect of the bal-\nancing inquiry for post-judgment motions to amend is \nfar less dramatic than BLOM suggests: \u201cIn the post-\njudgment context, we have indeed given \u2018due regard\u2019 \nto \u2018the liberal spirit of Rule 15\u2019 by ensuring plaintiffs \nat least one opportunity to replead.\u201d Metzler, 970 F.3d \nat 146 (quoting Williams, 659 F.3d at 213-14). See also \nMandala, 88 F.4th at 362 (same). If the plaintiff has \nhad a meaningful chance to amend, dismissal is no \nlonger extraordinary:  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n35 \n \nIn most if not all Second Circuit cases denying \npost-judgment leave to replead, the plaintiff \nhad already taken at least one shot at amend-\nment. This makes sense: when a plaintiff al-\nready had multiple chances to state a claim, \nthere is little risk of manifest injustice in deny-\ning yet another go. \nId. (citations omitted). \nBut a chance to state a claim is only meaningful if \nthe claimant has been fairly instructed in the correct \nlegal standard, either by a ruling of the district court \nor by clear precedent. Such a ruling identifies actual \nand remediable defects in the complaint, if any. See, \ne.g., United States ex rel. Customs Fraud Investiga-\ntions, LLC v. Victaulic Co., 839 F.3d 242, 250 (3d Cir. \n2016) (observing that without a ruling, \u201ca plaintiff is \nunlikely to know whether his complaint is actually de-\nficient\u2014and in need of revision\u201d); Tate v. SCR Med. \nTransp., 809 F.3d 343, 346 (7th Cir. 2015) (\u201cthe court \nshould grant leave to amend after dismissal of the first \ncomplaint \u2018unless it is certain from the face of the com-\nplaint that any amendment would be futile or other-\nwise unwarranted\u2019\u201d) (citation omitted); United States \nex rel. Lee v. Corinthian Colls., 655 F.3d 984, 998 (9th \nCir. 2011) (\u201c[plaintiffs] should have at least one oppor-\ntunity to add any such facts to the Complaint\u201d); Fire-\nstone v. Firestone, 76 F.3d 1205, 1208 (D.C. Cir. 1996) \n(similar). The Second Circuit noted that it is an \u201cim-\npropriety\u201d to deny amendment \u201cwithout the benefit of \na ruling,\u201d as that presents plaintiffs with a \u201cHobson\u2019s \nchoice: agree to cure deficiencies not yet fully briefed \nand decided or forfeit the opportunity to replead.\u201d Lo-\nreley Fin. (Jersey) No. 3 Ltd. v. Wells Fargo Sec., LLC, \n797 F.3d 160, 190 (2d Cir. 2015). \n\n \n \n \n \n \n36 \n \nOrdinarily, entering judgment dismissing a case \nwithout the opportunity to amend is an abuse of dis-\ncretion. See supra 30-31 (quoting Runnion, 786 F.3d at \n521). See also Jack v. Evonik Corp., 79 F.4th 547, 565 \n(5th Cir. 2023) (\u201cPlaintiffs should usually be able to \namend at least once, because \u2018fairness requires\u2019 it.\u201d) \n(citation omitted). In such case, \u201c[t]he district court left \nthe plaintiff with little recourse but to file a motion \nunder Rules 59(e) and 60(b) . . . .\u201d Foster v. DeLuca, \n545 F.3d 582, 584 (7th Cir. 2008).  \nIn fact, Plaintiffs\u2019 motion here would have come un-\nder Rule 59(e), which BLOM\u2019s cases suggest are eval-\nuated under Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal standards only, see \nsupra 31-32\u2014if not for the necessity of appealing the \ndistrict court\u2019s erroneous and essentially impossible \npleading standards first. See Mask of Ka-Nefer-Nefer, \n752 F.3d at 743 (explaining that appealing is \u201cthe \nproper recourse\u201d where a dismissal decision is wrong). \nAs the Seventh Circuit explained, \u201ca plaintiff who re-\nceives a Rule 12(b)(6) motion and who has good reason \nto think the complaint is sufficient may also choose to \nstand on the complaint and insist on a decision with-\nout losing the benefit of the well-established liberal \nstandard for amendment with leave of court under \nRule 15(a)(2).\u201d Runnion, 786 F.3d at 523. \nOf course, that entailed a risk\u2014Plaintiffs could \nhave been wrong on appeal. If the Second Circuit had \naffirmed the district court\u2019s reasoning (and not just \noutcome), that would not be an \u201cexceptional circum-\nstance\u201d\u2014that happens routinely and when it does, a \nplaintiff may have made a \u201cfree, calculated, [and] de-\nliberate choice\u201d not to take advantage of any prior op-\nportunities to amend. The circuit\u2019s affirmance on other \ngrounds here was thus fortuitous for BLOM\u2014but that \n\n \n \n \n \n \n37 \n \ndoes not justify elevating finality over the interests of \njustice. \nThis is why BLOM is compelled to argue that the \nSecond Circuit really affirmed dismissal of the case on \nthe same \u201cgrounds\u201d the district court used. Pet.Br.40. \nBut the district court acknowledged its dismissal was \nonly affirmed \u201con other grounds.\u201d Pet.App.10. The Sec-\nond Circuit\u2019s ground for affirmance involved one of the \nsame elements (knowledge), but for a fundamentally \ndifferent reason: the (original and still only) complaint \nrelied too much on \u201cpublicly available evidence\u201d rather \nthan \u201cpublic sources\u201d of information identifying \nBLOM\u2019s customers as Hamas-affiliated entities, and \nits allegation of the latter was too \u201climited.\u201d \nPet.App.51. \nThat the pleading standard was clarified on appeal \nis grounds to permit amendment, not deny it. For ex-\nample, in Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., \nthis Court explained that \u201c[w]hile we reject the Sev-\nenth Circuit\u2019s approach . . . we do not decide whether, \nunder the standard we have described . . . the Share-\nholders\u2019 allegations\u201d are sufficient. Because the lower \ncourts lacked \u201cthe opportunity to consider the matter \nin light of the prescriptions we announce today,\u201d the \nCourt vacated judgment \u201cso that the case may be reex-\namined in accord with our construction . . . .\u201d 551 U.S. \n308, 329 (2007). And after clarifying the Rule 8 plead-\ning standard in Ashcroft v. Iqbal, this Court ordered \nthat \u201c[t]he Court of Appeals should decide in the first \ninstance whether to remand to the District Court so \nthat respondent can seek leave to amend his deficient \ncomplaint.\u201d 556 U.S. 662, 687 (2009). See also Johnson \nv. City of Shelby, 574 U.S. 10, 12 (2014) (reversing dis-\nmissal with instructions to permit amendment if nec-\nessary). See also Marranzano v. Riggs Nat\u2019l Bank, 184 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n38 \n \nF.2d 349, 351 (D.C. Cir. 1950) (where a decision is \u201caf-\nfirmed\u201d but \u201cbased on an incorrect ground,\u201d the \u201cends \nof justice\u201d require \u201can opportunity to amend [the] com-\nplaint\u201d); Oil, Chem. & Atomic Workers Int\u2019l Union v. \nDelta Ref. Co., 277 F.2d 694, 697 (6th Cir. 1960) \n(where \u201cthe views which we have expressed give the \ncase a somewhat different aspect than it had under the \ntrial court\u2019s ruling,\u201d amendment is appropriate).  \nAfter the Second Circuit affirmed dismissal on \nother grounds in Honickman II, it left Plaintiffs the \nchoice of whether to move for post-judgment leave to \namend, if they thought they had the allegations to do \nso. But as is clear from the subsequent summary order \nbelow remanding the case for further consideration, \nthat affirmance was not intended to preclude Plain-\ntiffs from seeking an opportunity to amend.  \nII. \nThe Second Circuit Did Not Find Waiver, \nand Thus Did Not Alter the Vacatur Stand-\nard in Its Summary Order \nBLOM\u2019s argument hangs on the straw man that \nthe Second Circuit agreed that Plaintiffs \u201cconsistently \nand consciously rejected numerous invitations and op-\nportunities to amend,\u201d but nevertheless \u201cdirected dis-\ntrict courts to override and rescue parties from their \n\u2018free, calculated, [and] deliberate choices.\u2019\u201d Pet.Br.28-\n29 (citations omitted). Although BLOM pressed this \nargument to the circuit below, see BLOM Brief, No. 22-\n1039, Dkt. No. 42, at 1-2, 41-43, the circuit did not find \nany such waiver. To the contrary, it found that the dis-\ntrict court applied a \u201cwrong standard\u201d that was un-\nmeetable. As Judge Wesley asked BLOM\u2019s counsel \nduring the oral argument below, \u201cWhat are [Plaintiffs] \nsupposed to do? They know they can\u2019t amend [to] \n. . . meet\u201d the standard BLOM urged and the district \ncourt adopted. Notably, BLOM does not challenge the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n39 \n \nSecond Circuit\u2019s findings as to waiver in its question \npresented here. \nNevertheless, BLOM attempts to muster evidence \nof occasions when Plaintiffs forfeited opportunities to \namend. The first two \u201copportunities\u201d were the district \ncourt\u2019s invitations to amend before issuing its dismis-\nsal decision. But these opportunities were not mean-\ningful because they offered only to amend in conform-\nity with the incorrect legal standards BLOM urged, \ngiving Plaintiffs no notice of defects under the correct \nlegal standard. See, e.g., Bryant v. Dupree, 252 F.3d \n1161, 1164 (11th Cir. 2001) (\u201cit cannot be said that the \nplaintiffs failed to correct defects of which they had no-\ntice\u201d) (emphasis added). There is no forfeiture where \n\u201cDefendants did not [identify] below\u201d and \u201cthe district \ncourt itself did not rely on the deficiencies we have \nidentified in dismissing\u201d a plaintiff\u2019s claims\u2014espe-\ncially where \u201cthe district court\u2019s reasoning meant that \nno such amendments would remedy the defects that \nthe district court perceived.\u201d Charles Schwab Corp. v. \nBank of Am. Corp., 883 F.3d 68, 89-90 (2d Cir. 2018).  \nAgain, even the district court here acknowledged \nthat its dismissal decision was only affirmed \u201con other \ngrounds.\u201d Pet.App.10. BLOM notes that Plaintiffs \ncould have added some useful additional allegations in \ntheir proposed amended complaint before appealing, \nbut it would have been futile to do so given that Plain-\ntiffs would still have failed to meet each of the district \ncourt\u2019s (erroneous) standards.  \nIndeed, if declining these pre-judgment \u201copportuni-\nties\u201d to amend constituted waiver, litigants would be \ncompelled to file serial (futile) amendments and re-\nbrief Rule 12(b) motions simply to preserve their \nrights to amend post-appeal, which would hardly im-\nprove the efficiency of the lower federal courts or lead \n\n \n \n \n \n \n40 \n \nto more equitable outcomes. Likewise, a rule that dis-\nincentives bringing valid cases \u201cwhere the law [i]s re-\nally recasting itself\u201d in the circuit courts, as Judge \nWesley observed it was here, Oral Arg. at 13:23-38, \ndoes not promote the interests of justice. \nBLOM faults Plaintiffs for not moving for vacatur-\nfor-amendment instead of appealing, or not appealing \nthe with-prejudice nature of the dismissal. Pet.Br.11. \nPlaintiffs did not seek vacatur before appealing be-\ncause there is \u201cno reason\u201d to \u201cfile a post-judgment mo-\ntion seeking leave to amend\u201d where \u201cthe district \ncourt\u2019s reasoning meant that no such amendments \nwould remedy the defects that the district court per-\nceived.\u201d Charles Schwab, 883 F.3d at 90. Again, \u201cthe \nproper recourse when [a party] disagreed with the dis-\ntrict court\u2019s interpretation of the . . . statute was a di-\nrect appeal, not a Rule 60(b) motion.\u201d Mask of Ka-\nNefer-Nefer, 752 F.3d at 743. And Plaintiffs did not \nappeal the \u201cwith-prejudice\u201d component of the dismis-\nsal decision because leave to amend would not have \naltered the result without the circuit first correcting \nthe district court\u2019s legal errors.  \nFinally, BLOM also faults Plaintiffs for not asking \nthe circuit court for leave to amend in their post-argu-\nment supplemental brief in Honickman II. Pet.Br.11. \nThough asking the circuit for leave to amend is per-\nmissible, in the Second Circuit, post-judgment leave to \namend is generally a decision for the district court to \nmake \u201cin the first instance.\u201d Iqbal v. Ashcroft, 574 F.3d \n820, 822 (2d Cir. 2009).6 The circuit court\u2019s job is to \n \n6  \nBLOM also faults Plaintiffs for \u201cnot seek[ing] rehearing,\u201d \nPet.Br.12, but in the Mandala dissent BLOM relies on, Judge Sul-\nlivan criticized precisely that: \u201c[r]ather than seek vacatur and \nleave to amend\u201d after the first appeal, \u201cPlaintiffs instead opted to \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n41 \n \nassess the district court\u2019s ruling\u2014it goes without say-\ning that if a viable amendment is necessary, plaintiffs \nwill want to make it. The summary order demon-\nstrates that the circuit court did not find a need for \nPlaintiffs to have requested leave to amend from the \nfirst panel (Judge Wesley was on both unanimous pan-\nels). \nIII. \nThe Balancing Inquiry Does Not Conflict \nwith the Text of Any of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure. \nBLOM argues that the Second Circuit\u2019s precedent \nconflicts with the plain text of Rule 15(a) and Rule \n60(b). To do so, it erroneously construes the Second \nCircuit\u2019s basis for remand as \u201callow[ing] plaintiffs to \nleapfrog over \u2018Rule 60(b)\u2019s finality gauntlet\u2019 to the \nsanctuary of \u2018Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal repleading policy.\u2019\u201d \nPet.Br.30. Again, the Second Circuit directs district \ncourts to balance Rule 60(b)\u2019s finality and Rule 15(a)\u2019s \nliberality \u201cin tandem,\u201d Pet.App.7; it does not permit \n\u201cleapfrogging.\u201d See Meltzer, 970 F.3d at 146 (finding \nthe \u201cargument that the [post-judgment] motion is gov-\nerned solely by the legal standard applicable to Rule \n15(a)(2) motions . . . without merit.\u201d). \nTo establish a textual conflict, BLOM argues that \nRule 15(a) \u201capplies only to \u2018Amendments Before \nTrial,\u2019\u201d and \u201c[i]t is in that setting . . . that the Rules \nencourage courts to \u2018freely give leave\u2019 to amend.\u201d \nPet.Br.30. Thus, BLOM suggests, Rule 15\u2019s preference \n \nfile a petition for rehearing en banc\u2014a strategic choice that \nplainly undermines any argument that some aspect of the district \ncourt\u2019s order was an \u2018extraordinary circumstance\u2019 preventing \nPlaintiffs from pursuing their claims.\u201d 88 F.4th at 368. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n42 \n \nfor deciding cases on their merits is entirely extin-\nguished at judgment.  \nBut Rule 15 contemplates two stages of amend-\nment\u2014before trial and during or after trial. Both in-\nvolve \u201cfreely\u201d giving leave to amend, under certain cir-\ncumstances which depend on trial, not judgment. See \nRule 15(a)(2), Rule 15(b)(1). The rule has no higher \nstandard. \nIndeed, \n\u201c\u2018[a]mendments \nunder \n[Rule \n15(a)(2)] may be made at any stage of the litigation.\u2019 \nGranting leave to amend after summary judgment is \nthus allowed at the discretion of the trial court.\u201d Ngu-\nyen v. United States, 792 F.2d 1500, 1502 (9th Cir. \n1986) (quoting 6 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Prac-\ntice and Procedure \u00a7 1484 (1971)). See also Dussouy v. \nGulf Coast Inv. Corp., 660 F.2d 594, 598 (5th Cir. \n1981) (applying Rule 15 and noting that \u201c[i]nstances \nabound in which appellate courts on review have re-\nquired that leave to amend be granted after dismissal \nor entry of judgment\u201d). \nObviously, this case was not dismissed after trial\u2014\nit was dismissed following an initial Rule 12(b)(6) mo-\ntion, before Plaintiffs had the opportunity to try to \ncure any actual defects in their complaint. That is pre-\ncisely the context that Rule 15(a) squarely addresses. \nEntering judgment does not eliminate Rule 15(a)\u2019s \npreference for \u201cresolving disputes on their merits.\u201d \nKrupski, 560 U.S. at 550. \nBLOM argues that Rule 15(a) \u201cdoes not provide a \nmechanism for amending pleadings after dismissal,\u201d \nPet.Br.30, but that is likewise irrelevant. To the extent \nRule 60(b)(6) provides the \u201cmechanism,\u201d it is an \u201cex-\nception to finality\u201d for \u201cany reason that justifies relief.\u201d \nGranting leave to amend \u201cwhen justice so requires,\u201d as \nRule 15(a) commands, presumably informs the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n43 \n \nreasons that \u201cjustify relief\u201d under Rule 60(b)(6)\u2014in-\ncluding providing an opportunity to amend at least \nonce.7  \nBLOM asserts that the Second Circuit\u2019s \u201cbalancing \ntest\u201d conflicts with the rest of Rule 60(b) because it \nwould permit plaintiffs to \u201cevade those explicit time \nlimitations in\u201d Rule 60(b)(1) (relief given mistake or \nexcusable neglect) and Rule 60(b)(2) (relief given new \nevidence). Pet.Br.31-33. But the Second Circuit has \nnever suggested that vacatur and amendment are per-\nmissible where a complaint failed due to counsel\u2019s mis-\ntake or where a plaintiff simply wants to present new \nevidence over a year after judgment. Instead, a district \ncourt\u2019s failure to give plaintiffs at least one meaningful \nopportunity to replead may constitute extraordinary \ncircumstances, and vacatur and amendment may be \nappropriate.  \nIn Mandala, the Second Circuit determined which \nprovision of Rule 60(b) applied before turning to the \npolicies and standards of either Rule 60(b) or Rule \n15(a): \u201cProper characterization of Plaintiffs\u2019 Rule 60(b) \nmotion is a threshold issue because, as previously ex-\nplained, [Rule 60(b)\u2019s] provisions are subject to differ-\nent filing limitations . . . .\u201d 88 F.4th at 359. The Second \nCircuit determined that Rule 60(b)(6) was the proper \nrule because \u201cinsufficient pleading is not categorically \na \u2018mistake,\u2019 and Plaintiffs\u2019 belief that their Complaint \nsatisfied the standards for pleading a disparate impact \nclaim was well-founded, even if ultimately erroneous.\u201d \nId. \n \n7  \nBLOM contends that this Court should read Rule 60(b) \nwith Rule 1, not Rule 15(a). Pet.Br.35-38. But Rule 1 does not \nnegate Rule 15\u2014to the extent Rule 1 provides any guidance here, \nit is its command to secure the \u201cjust\u201d outcome. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n44 \n \nNor does the decision below conflict with Rule \n60(b)(2), which only permits vacatur to introduce (1) \nnewly discovered evidence (2) within a year of judg-\nment. The Second Circuit does not permit post-judg-\nment amendments \u201cbased on previously omitted alle-\ngations,\u201d as BLOM asserts (or evidence discovered \nover a year after judgment). Pet.Br.33. In fact, Metzler \nrejected an attempt to circumvent Rule 60(b)(2)\u2019s \n\u201cnewly discovered evidence standard.\u201d 970 F.3d at 146. \nThat case still required a showing of extraordinary cir-\ncumstances under Rule 60(b)(6). BLOM points out \nthat movants might introduce allegations they could \nhave presented before, Pet.Br.33, but Rule 60(b) gives \nreasons for vacating a judgment\u2014it does not limit \nwhat a party can include in an amended pleading once \nvacatur and leave to amend are granted. \nTo be clear, BLOM no longer appears to contest \nthat Rule 60(b)(6) applies in this case. The district \ncourt itself found that Rule 60(b)(6) applied here, not-\ning that \u201cnone of [the other provisions] are applicable\u201d \nto Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for vacatur. Pet.App.12. BLOM \ndid nevertheless argue to the panel below that Rule \n60(b)(1) applied, but the circuit did not accept the ar-\ngument, assessing the case under Rule 60(b)(6). See \nPet.App.6-7. BLOM did not challenge the district \ncourt\u2019s or circuit court\u2019s application of Rule 60(b)(6) in \nits petition for certiorari or in their merits brief to this \nCourt. \nIV. \nExtraordinary Circumstances Are Present \nHere Because After Honickman II Clarified \nthe Previously \u201cAmbigu[ous]\u201d Legal Stand-\nards, Plaintiffs Were Denied Any Oppor-\ntunity to Meet Them. \nAs this Court has explained, \u201c[i]n determining \nwhether extraordinary circumstances are present \n\n \n \n \n \n \n45 \n \n[under Rule 60(b)(6)], a court may consider a wide \nrange of factors,\u201d including \u201c\u2018the risk of injustice to the \nparties\u2019 and \u2018the risk of undermining the public\u2019s con-\nfidence in the judicial process.\u2019\u201d Buck, 580 U.S. at 123 \n(quoting Liljeberg, 486 U.S. at 864). In Mandala, the \nSecond Circuit noted several factors in that case that \nestablished exceptional circumstances for purposes of \na motion for post-judgment amendment: \n[1] Plaintiffs have yet to be afforded a single op-\nportunity to amend their pleading; [2] the orig-\ninal dismissal of the Complaint was premised \non grounds subject to reasonable, actual, and \nvigorous debate; [3] Plaintiffs diligently prose-\ncuted their case at all times; and [4] Plaintiffs\u2019 \nproposed amendments address the sole plead-\ning deficiency identified by the district court.  \n88 F.4th at 365.  \nPlaintiffs meet all of these factors here. Denying \nPlaintiffs leave to amend risks injustice, as they may \nlose their only opportunity to have this case decided on \nthe merits, as the statute of limitations has run on \ntheir claims. See LeBlanc v. Cleveland, 248 F.3d 95, \n101 (2d Cir. 2001) (finding \u201c\u2018extraordinary circum-\nstances\u2019 under Rule 60(b)(6), because [plaintiff] would \nbe left without a remedy if the motion [for vacatur and \nleave to amend] were not granted\u201d). And where the \ncase is at its earliest stage, with no discovery con-\nducted, the prejudice to BLOM is limited solely to \nbriefing a new motion to dismiss against allegations \ntailored to meet the legal standards articulated by the \nSecond Circuit and this Court in Taamneh. The poten-\ntial burden of re-briefing a motion to dismiss is already \nbuilt into Rules 15(a)(1) and (2) and is not the kind of \nprejudice that the Rule considers. See, e.g., Patton v. \nGuyer, 443 F.2d 79, 86 (10th Cir. 1971) (\u201cThere is \n\n \n \n \n \n \n46 \n \ninvariably some practical prejudice resulting from an \namendment, but this is not the test for refusal of an \namendment. . . . The defendants were not prejudiced \nin terms of preparing their defense to the amend-\nment.\u201d). \nIndeed, courts have applied more liberal standards \nto motions for post-judgment amendment at early \nstages in the litigation. For example, the Fifth Circuit \nheld that \u201cthe Rule 15 standards apply when a party \nseeks to amend a judgment that has been entered \nbased on the pleadings,\u201d but doubted whether those \nstandards would apply \u201cafter trial.\u201d S. Constructors \nGrp. v. Dynalectric Co., 2 F.3d 606, 611 (5th Cir. 1993). \nSee also Duggins v. Steak \u2018n Shake, Inc., 195 F.3d 828, \n834 (6th Cir. 1999) (holding that amendment risks sig-\nnificant prejudice \u201cafter the close of discovery\u201d); Ru-\notolo v. City of N.Y., 514 F.3d 184, 187, 192 (2d Cir. \n2008) (similar).  \nPlaintiffs have also yet to be afforded a single \nmeaningful opportunity to amend their complaint; the \nbasis for the original dismissal of the complaint was \nnot merely open to \u201cvigorous debate,\u201d Mandala, 88 \nF.4th at 365, but entirely incorrect; Plaintiffs dili-\ngently prosecuted their case, appealing and moving for \nvacatur expeditiously; and Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed amend-\nments could address the actual defects in the com-\nplaint that the Second Circuit identified.  \nBLOM argues that no extraordinary circumstances \nare present here because (1) the district court\u2019s deci-\nsion was affirmed on the same grounds it provided; (2) \nPlaintiffs waived any \u201cright\u201d to an amendment be-\ncause they did not take the district court\u2019s invitations \nto amend; (3) even if the district court was wrong, a \nclarification or change in law is not an extraordinary \ncircumstance; and (4) Plaintiffs are at \u201cfault\u201d for \n\n \n \n \n \n \n47 \n \nfailing to amend or delaying doing so. Pet.Br.39-45. \nThe first two reasons are addressed above: the dismis-\nsal decision was premised on \u201cthe wrong legal stand-\nard,\u201d and the Second Circuit did not find that Plaintiffs \n\u201cwaived\u201d any meaningful opportunities to amend.  \nBLOM asserts that \u201cmere clarification of the law is \nnot extraordinary,\u201d as it \u201cis what appellate courts do \nday in and day out\u201d\u2014and, in fact, \u201cthis Court has held \nthat even an outright change in the law does not war-\nrant relief under Rule 60(b)(6).\u201d Pet.Br.19 (citing Gon-\nzalez, 545 U.S. at 537). But in Gonzalez, the change in \nlaw was made in another case after the case under re-\nview was decided, leading this Court to remark: \u201c[i]t is \nhardly extraordinary that subsequently, after peti-\ntioner\u2019s case was no longer pending, this Court arrived \nat a different interpretation.\u201d 545 U.S. at 537. Moreo-\nver, Mr. Gonzalez failed to show sufficient diligence \nbecause he did not \u201cseek review of the District Court\u2019s \ndecision\u201d on the issue relating to his vacatur motion. \nId.  \nHere the \u201cclarification\u201d came in the same case, as a \nresult of Plaintiffs\u2019 appeal. See Charles Schwab, 883 \nF.3d at 89-90. The Second Circuit \u201cacknowledge[d] the \ndistrict court\u2019s decision came before our opinion \nin Kaplan [II] clarified the import of our earlier \nJASTA aiding-and-abetting precedents which may \nhave generated some ambiguity as to the proper \nstandard.\u201d Pet.App.40 n.11. It is manifestly unfair to \nexpect Plaintiffs to fully understand a set of legal \nstandards that were still being \u201crecast[],\u201d Oral Arg. at \n13:23-38, when the district court could not. \nBLOM argues in the alternative that if the Second \nCircuit\u2019s clarification was \u201cin line with [Plaintiffs\u2019] \nown interpretation\u201d of JASTA, Plaintiffs \u201cnever \u2018ex-\nplain[ed] why they did not allege facts sufficient to \n\n \n \n \n \n \n48 \n \nsatisfy the standard for which they were advocating.\u2019\u201d \nPet.Br.41 (quoting Pet.App.17 n.5). But while Plain-\ntiffs were indeed broadly correct about JASTA\u2019s plead-\ning standards\u2014a fact that BLOM argues somehow \ncounts against them\u2014they could not anticipate the ev-\nidentiary distinction newly articulated by the Second \nCircuit between \u201cpublicly available evidence\u201d and \n\u201cpublic sources.\u201d \nIn fact, this Court has held that even a change in \nlaw in another case can constitute extraordinary cir-\ncumstances. See Kemp v. United States, 596 U.S. 528, \n540 (2022) (noting \u201cthe availability of Rule 60(b)(6) to \nreopen a judgment in extraordinary circumstances, in-\ncluding a change in controlling law\u201d and citing cases) \n(Sotomayor, J., concurring). For example, a change in \nlaw relating to the same incident justified reversing a \nthree-year-old denial of certiorari, because \u201cthe inter-\nest in finality of litigation must yield where the inter-\nests of justice would make unfair the strict application \nof our rules\u201d\u2014another recitation of the balancing test. \nGondeck v. Pan Am. World Airways, Inc., 382 U.S. 25, \n26-28 (1965). The Tenth Circuit also found such a \nchange in law in another case an \u201cextraordinary situ-\nation justifying Rule 60(b)(6) relief.\u201d Pierce v. Cook & \nCo., 518 F.2d 720, 723-24 (10th Cir. 1975) (en banc). \nThe interests of justice and demands of fairness are \neven more pronounced when the relevant \u201cchange in \nlaw\u201d occurs in the same case.  \nPetitioner\u2019s fourth waiver argument is wrong as \nwell: unlike BLOM\u2019s cases rejecting post-judgment \namendments that were strategically delayed like \nJames and Rozensweig, Plaintiffs here are not at any \n\u201cfault\u201d and did not engage in any \u201cgamesmanship.\u201d \nPet.Br.27, 33, 36, 44. They timely appealed the district \ncourt\u2019s incorrect dismissal decision and, once \u201c[a]rmed \n\n \n \n \n \n \n49 \n \nwith [the Second Circuit\u2019s] clarifications,\u201d promptly \nmoved for vacatur and leave to amend. There was no \n\u201cundue delay\u201d\u2014although \u201cdelay alone, regardless of \nits length is not enough to bar [amendment] if the \nother party is not prejudiced.\u201d Moore v. Paducah, 790 \nF.2d 557, 560 (6th Cir. 1986) (quoting 3 Moore\u2019s Fed-\neral Practice, para. 15.08 at 15.76). As explained \nabove, BLOM would not be unduly prejudiced by vaca-\ntur and amendment here. \nCONCLUSION \nBLOM quotes extensively from Ackermann v. \nUnited States to argue that \u201c\u2018[t]here must be an end to \nlitigation someday . . . .\u201d Pet.Br.1, 29 (quoting 340 U.S. \n193, 198 (1950)). BLOM\u2019s comparison of Ackermann to \nthis case is illustrative of its arguments generally. In \nAckermann, the petitioners sought vacatur four years \nafter judgments were entered following a trial, in or-\nder to bring an extremely late appeal. This case has \nnever even entered discovery. See Dubicz v. Common-\nwealth Edison Co., 377 F.3d 787, 793 n.1 (7th Cir. \n2004) (\u201cIt is important to emphasize that this litiga-\ntion has never progressed beyond the pleadings stage. \nThis is not the case where a plaintiff seeks to amend \nits complaint after the close of discovery or on the eve \nof trial.\u201d). Plaintiffs did file a timely and necessary ap-\npeal. Dismissal here is hardly what this Court in \nAckermann meant by \u201csomeday.\u201d \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be af-\nfirmed and the case should be remanded for further \nproceedings.  \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n50 \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \n \nMichael Radine \n Counsel of Record \nGary M.

This Court has also stressed \nthat a movant must be \u201cfaultless\u201d to obtain relief.  \nPioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. Brunswick Assocs.

In this case, Respondents \ndeclined multiple invitations and opportunities to \namend their complaint.  The District Court then \ndismissed their complaint with prejudice, and the \nSecond Circuit affirmed.  Only then did Respondents \nask the District Court to vacate the judgment so they \ncould file an amended complaint that would include \npreviously available facts.  The District Court denied \nthe \nmotion \nunder \nRule \n60(b)(6)\u2019s \nwell-settled \nstandard.

As those precedents make clear, obtaining \nrelief from a final judgment under Rule 60(b)(6) \n\u201crequires a showing of \u2018extraordinary circumstances.\u2019\u201d  \nGonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524, 536 (2005).  And \nthose circumstances must demonstrate \u201cthat the \n[moving] party is faultless.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. \nBrunswick Assocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship, 507 U.S. 380, 393 \n(1993).  After all, \u201c[t]here must be an end to litigation \nsomeday, and free, calculated, deliberate choices are \nnot to be relieved from.\u201d  Ackermann v. United States, \n340 U.S. 193, 198 (1950). \nIt could hardly be otherwise.  Our adversarial \nsystem of civil justice could not function without a \nscrupulous regard for the conclusiveness of judgments \nprofessing to settle the parties\u2019 rights.  Courts have \nrecognized that fundamental precept since the \nFounding.  Consistent with that history and tradition, \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure afford district \ncourts the power to revisit a final judgment through \nRule 60(b) only in \u201ca limited set of circumstances.\u201d  \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. at 528.  And they strictly prohibit \na party from moving for such relief more than a year \nafter judgment if that party is even \u201cpartly to blame \nfor the delay.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs., 507 U.S. at 393; see \nFed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1), (c)(1).  \nFor decades, lower courts have faithfully applied \nthese well-settled principles of judgment finality.  And \nthey have uniformly rejected attempts by plaintiffs to \navoid Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent requirements by \n\n2 \n \nappealing to Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policy.  \nIndeed, the two inquiries are entirely separate.  Rule \n15(a) applies before trial and judgment, while Rule 60 \napplies after a final judgment.  Accordingly, \u201cif a \nplaintiff seeks to reopen a case under Rule 60(b) in \norder to file an amended complaint, she must satisfy \none of the Rule 60(b) grounds\u201d and have the judgment \nset aside \u201cbefore a court may consider her motion to \namend.\u201d  Daulatzai v. Maryland, 97 F.4th 166, 178 \n(4th Cir. 2024).  As the Fourth Circuit aptly put it \nearlier this year, adopting a contrary rule would have \nplaced it \u201calone in the Nation in collapsing the Rule \n60(b) standard with the standard for Rule 15(a).\u201d  Id. \nat 177. \nBut the decision below did just that\u2014in a case \nwhere Respondents repeatedly declined to amend \ntheir complaint in the normal course.  By rejecting the \nDistrict Court\u2019s multiple invitations to amend their \ncomplaint, Respondents deliberately chose to proceed \non that complaint as pled and take their chances on a \nmotion to dismiss.  The District Court eventually \ndismissed the complaint with prejudice, and the \nSecond Circuit affirmed the dismissal after full merits \nbriefing, oral argument, and supplemental briefing.  \nAt no time during those proceedings did Respondents \nseek leave to amend.   \nThen, more than 18 months after the dismissal \nwith prejudice\u2014and after that dismissal was affirmed \non appeal\u2014Respondents filed a Rule 60(b)(6) motion \nto vacate the judgment so they could restart the \nprocess and try again with an amended complaint.  \nThe District Court rejected that effort by properly \napplying Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent standard.  It \n\n3 \n \nemphasized that Respondents had \u201cnot demonstrated \nany extraordinary circumstances\u201d and had engaged in \na \u201cseries of deliberate choices not to cure the \ndeficiencies identified in their pleading by [Petitioner] \nand th[e] Court.\u201d  Pet.App.14, 19.  The District Court \ntherefore permissibly exercised its discretion to deny \nRespondents\u2019 motion. \nThe \nSecond \nCircuit \nnevertheless \nreversed.  \nApplying an atextual balancing test adopted by a split \npanel in Mandala v. NTT Data, Inc., 88 F.4th 353 (2d \nCir. 2023), the Second Circuit held that the District \nCourt abused its discretion by failing to \u201cgive \u2018due \nregard\u2019 to \u2018both the philosophy favoring finality of \njudgments . . . and the liberal amendment policy of \nRule 15(a).\u2019\u201d  Pet.App.7 (alteration in original) \n(quoting Mandala, 88 F.4th at 361).  In the Second \nCircuit\u2019s view, district courts are \u201crequired to consider \nRule 60(b) finality and Rule 15(a) liberality in tandem\u201d \nwhen plaintiffs seek to reopen a judgment in order to \nfile an amended complaint.  Id.  It thus faulted the \nDistrict Court for analyzing Respondents\u2019 Rule 60(b) \nmotion \u201cunder only Rule 60(b)\u2019s standard.\u201d  Id.   \nThat reasoning is indefensible.  The Second \nCircuit\u2019s outlier balancing test effectively rewrites the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.  It destroys the \nfinality principles embodied in Rule 60(b).  It \nencourages wasteful and pernicious litigation tactics.  \nIt imbues uncertainty.  And it contravenes this Court\u2019s \nprecedents at every turn.  This Court should reverse. \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe District Court\u2019s opinion dismissing the case \nwith prejudice on January 14, 2020 is reported at 432 \nF.

Crosby, 545 U.S. 524, \n535 (2005) (quoting Ackermann v. United States, 340 \nU.S. 193, 199 (1950)).  This Court has also stressed \nthat a movant must be \u201cfaultless\u201d to obtain relief.  \nPioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. Brunswick Assocs. Ltd. \nP\u2019ship, 507 U.S. 380, 393 (1993).  \u201cThis very strict \ninterpretation of Rule 60(b) is essential if the finality \nof judgments is to be preserved.\u201d  Gonzalez, 545 U.S. \nat 535 (citation omitted).  In this case, Respondents \ndeclined multiple invitations and opportunities to \namend their complaint.  The District Court then \ndismissed their complaint with prejudice, and the \nSecond Circuit affirmed.  Only then did Respondents \nask the District Court to vacate the judgment so they \ncould file an amended complaint that would include \npreviously available facts.  The District Court denied \nthe \nmotion \nunder \nRule \n60(b)(6)\u2019s \nwell-settled \nstandard.  But the Second Circuit reversed, based on \nan anomalous \u201cbalanc[ing]\u201d test that requires district \ncourts to heed Rule 15(a)\u2019s \u201cliberal pleading principles\u201d \nwhen addressing a Rule 60(b)(6) motion to reopen a \nfinal judgment for the purpose of filing an amended \ncomplaint. \nThe question presented is: \nWhether Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent standard applies \nto a post-judgment request to vacate for the purpose of \nfiling an amended complaint. \n \n\nii \n \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nPetitioner BLOM Bank SAL was defendant in the \nUnited States District Court for the Eastern District \nof New York and appellee in the United States Court \nof Appeals for the Second Circuit.  \nRespondents Michal Honickman, Individually and \nfor the Estate of Howard Goldstein, Eugene \nGoldstein, Lorraine Goldstein, Richard Goldstein, \nBarbara Goldstein Ingardia, Michael Goldstein, \nChana Freedman, David Goldstein, Moses Strauss, \nPhilip Strauss, Bluma Strauss, Ahron Strauss, Roisie \nEngelman, Joseph Strauss, Tzvi Weiss, Leib Weiss, \nIndividually and for the Estate of Malka Weiss, \nYitzchak Weiss, Yeruchaim Weiss, Esther Deutsch, \nMatanya Nathansen, Individually and for the Estate \nof Tehilla Nathansen, Chana Nathansen, Individually \nand for the Estate of Tehilla Nathansen, Yehudit \nNathansen, S.N., a minor, Hezekial Toporowitch, \nPearl B.

As those precedents make clear, obtaining \nrelief from a final judgment under Rule 60(b)(6) \n\u201crequires a showing of \u2018extraordinary circumstances.\u2019\u201d  \nGonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524, 536 (2005).  And \nthose circumstances must demonstrate \u201cthat the \n[moving] party is faultless.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. \nBrunswick Assocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship, 507 U.S. 380, 393 \n(1993).  After all, \u201c[t]here must be an end to litigation \nsomeday, and free, calculated, deliberate choices are \nnot to be relieved from.\u201d  Ackermann v. United States, \n340 U.S. 193, 198 (1950). \nIt could hardly be otherwise.  Our adversarial \nsystem of civil justice could not function without a \nscrupulous regard for the conclusiveness of judgments \nprofessing to settle the parties\u2019 rights.  Courts have \nrecognized that fundamental precept since the \nFounding.  Consistent with that history and tradition, \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure afford district \ncourts the power to revisit a final judgment through \nRule 60(b) only in \u201ca limited set of circumstances.\u201d  \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. at 528.  And they strictly prohibit \na party from moving for such relief more than a year \nafter judgment if that party is even \u201cpartly to blame \nfor the delay.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs., 507 U.S. at 393; see \nFed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1), (c)(1).  \nFor decades, lower courts have faithfully applied \nthese well-settled principles of judgment finality.  And \nthey have uniformly rejected attempts by plaintiffs to \navoid Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent requirements by \n\n2 \n \nappealing to Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policy.  \nIndeed, the two inquiries are entirely separate.  Rule \n15(a) applies before trial and judgment, while Rule 60 \napplies after a final judgment.  Accordingly, \u201cif a \nplaintiff seeks to reopen a case under Rule 60(b) in \norder to file an amended complaint, she must satisfy \none of the Rule 60(b) grounds\u201d and have the judgment \nset aside \u201cbefore a court may consider her motion to \namend.\u201d  Daulatzai v. Maryland, 97 F.4th 166, 178 \n(4th Cir. 2024).  As the Fourth Circuit aptly put it \nearlier this year, adopting a contrary rule would have \nplaced it \u201calone in the Nation in collapsing the Rule \n60(b) standard with the standard for Rule 15(a).\u201d  Id. \nat 177. \nBut the decision below did just that\u2014in a case \nwhere Respondents repeatedly declined to amend \ntheir complaint in the normal course.  By rejecting the \nDistrict Court\u2019s multiple invitations to amend their \ncomplaint, Respondents deliberately chose to proceed \non that complaint as pled and take their chances on a \nmotion to dismiss.  The District Court eventually \ndismissed the complaint with prejudice, and the \nSecond Circuit affirmed the dismissal after full merits \nbriefing, oral argument, and supplemental briefing.  \nAt no time during those proceedings did Respondents \nseek leave to amend.   \nThen, more than 18 months after the dismissal \nwith prejudice\u2014and after that dismissal was affirmed \non appeal\u2014Respondents filed a Rule 60(b)(6) motion \nto vacate the judgment so they could restart the \nprocess and try again with an amended complaint.  \nThe District Court rejected that effort by properly \napplying Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent standard.  It \n\n3 \n \nemphasized that Respondents had \u201cnot demonstrated \nany extraordinary circumstances\u201d and had engaged in \na \u201cseries of deliberate choices not to cure the \ndeficiencies identified in their pleading by [Petitioner] \nand th[e] Court.\u201d  Pet.App.14, 19.  The District Court \ntherefore permissibly exercised its discretion to deny \nRespondents\u2019 motion. \nThe \nSecond \nCircuit \nnevertheless \nreversed.  \nApplying an atextual balancing test adopted by a split \npanel in Mandala v. NTT Data, Inc., 88 F.4th 353 (2d \nCir. 2023), the Second Circuit held that the District \nCourt abused its discretion by failing to \u201cgive \u2018due \nregard\u2019 to \u2018both the philosophy favoring finality of \njudgments . . . and the liberal amendment policy of \nRule 15(a).\u2019\u201d  Pet.App.7 (alteration in original) \n(quoting Mandala, 88 F.4th at 361).  In the Second \nCircuit\u2019s view, district courts are \u201crequired to consider \nRule 60(b) finality and Rule 15(a) liberality in tandem\u201d \nwhen plaintiffs seek to reopen a judgment in order to \nfile an amended complaint.  Id.  It thus faulted the \nDistrict Court for analyzing Respondents\u2019 Rule 60(b) \nmotion \u201cunder only Rule 60(b)\u2019s standard.\u201d  Id.   \nThat reasoning is indefensible.  The Second \nCircuit\u2019s outlier balancing test effectively rewrites the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.  It destroys the \nfinality principles embodied in Rule 60(b).  It \nencourages wasteful and pernicious litigation tactics.  \nIt imbues uncertainty.  And it contravenes this Court\u2019s \nprecedents at every turn.  This Court should reverse. \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe District Court\u2019s opinion dismissing the case \nwith prejudice on January 14, 2020 is reported at 432 \nF.

The petition for writ of certiorari was timely \nfiled on May 29, 2024, and granted on October 4, 2024.  \nThis Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nFEDERAL RULES INVOLVED \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) governs \nmotions for \u201cRelief from a Final Judgment.\u201d  It \nprovides five specific grounds for relief.  See Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 60(b)(1)-(5).  Rule 60(b)(6) then states that \u201cthe \ncourt may relieve a party or its legal representative \nfrom a final judgment, order, or proceeding for . . . any \nother reason that justifies relief.\u201d \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a) governs \n\u201cAmendments Before Trial.\u201d  Rule 15(a)(2) provides \nthat \u201ca party may amend its pleading only with the \nopposing party\u2019s written consent or the court\u2019s leave.  \nThe court should freely give leave when justice so \nrequires.\u201d \n\n5 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. The Initial District Court Proceedings \nRespondents filed this lawsuit on January 1, 2019, \na day before the statute of limitations expired and \nnearly sixteen years after the latest of the events in \nquestion.  JA.1; see Pub. L. No. 112-239, \u00a7 1251(c), 126 \nStat. 1632, 2017-18 (2013) (extending the ordinary \nlimitations period for certain Anti-Terrorism Act \nclaims to January 2, 2019).  Respondents are victims \nand the families of victims of terrorist attacks carried \nout by Hamas between December 1, 2001, and August \n19, 2003.  JA.7-81.  As Petitioner explained in the \nproceedings below, it categorically abhors terrorism, it \nhas no connection to Hamas, and it is not legally or \nfactually \nresponsible \nfor \nRespondents\u2019 \ninjuries.  \nJA.160-62, 168-72.1   \nThe complaint accuses Petitioner of aiding and \nabetting those attacks through a daisy chain of \nspeculation.  In particular, Respondents allege that \n \n1  Respondents have filed almost a dozen more lawsuits \nagainst other defendants in the nearly sixteen years following the \nattacks, all seeking damages for the same injuries alleged here.  \nSee Kirschenbaum v. Islamic Repub. of Iran, No. 1:03-cv-01708-\nRCL (D.D.C.); Sokolow v. Palestine Liberation Org., No. 1:04-cv-\n00397-GBD-RLE (S.D.N.Y); Linde v. Arab Bank, PLC, No. 1:04-\ncv-02799-BMC-PK (E.D.N.Y.); Wolf v. Credit Lyonnais, S.A., No. \n07-cv-00914 (E.D.N.Y.); Applebaum v.

Bank, No. 1:19-cv-\n00005-EK-JAM (E.D.N.Y.). \n\n6 \n \nPetitioner provided routine financial services to three \ncustomers:  Sanabil, Subul al-Khair, and Union of \nGood (together, the \u201cThree Customers\u201d).  JA.106, 116, \n120.  Though the Complaint spans 645 paragraphs, it \nsays relatively little about the Three Customers (or \nPetitioner).  See generally JA.1-122.  In fact, none of \nthe Three Customers was itself alleged to have \nengaged in acts of terrorism.  Instead, \u201cthe Three \nCustomers were alleged only to have supported \norphans in Palestinian refugee camps.\u201d  Pet.App.52 \nn.21.   \nRespondents pled their claim under the Anti-\nTerrorism Act (\u201cATA\u201d), as amended by the Justice \nAgainst Sponsors of Terrorism Act (\u201cJASTA\u201d).  JA.121-\n22.  Under the ATA, a United States national \u201cinjured \nin his or her person, property, or business by reason of \nan act of international terrorism, or his or her estate, \nsurvivors, or heirs, may sue therefor in any \nappropriate district court of the United States.\u201d  18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2333(a).  JASTA provides for secondary \nliability against \u201cany person who aids and abets, by \nknowingly providing substantial assistance, or who \nconspires with the person who committed such an act \nof international terrorism.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 2333(d)(2).   \nTo impose secondary liability, JASTA requires \u201cthat \nthe defendant consciously and culpably \u2018participated\u2019 \nin a wrongful act so as to help \u2018make it succeed.\u2019\u201d  \nTwitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, 598 U.S. 471, 493 (2023) \n(alteration adopted) (quoting Nye & Nissen v. United \nStates, 326 U.S. 613, 619 (1949)).  And \u201cJASTA further \nrestricts secondary liability by requiring that the \u2018act \nof international terrorism\u2019 be \u2018committed, planned, or \nauthorized by\u2019 a foreign terrorist organization \n\n7 \n \ndesignated as such \u2018as of the date on which such act of \ninternational terrorism was committed, planned, or \nauthorized.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 495 (quoting 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2333(d)(2)).  Thus, \u201cit is not enough\u201d that a \ndefendant has \u201cgiven substantial assistance to a \ntranscendent \u2018enterprise\u2019 separate from and floating \nabove all the actionable wrongs that constitute it.\u201d  Id.  \n\u201cRather, a defendant must have aided and abetted (by \nknowingly providing substantial assistance) another \nperson in the commission of the actionable wrong\u2014\nhere, an act of international terrorism.\u201d  Id.  \nUnder JASTA, one of the three elements for aiding-\nand-abetting liability is that \u201cthe defendant must be \ngenerally aware of his role as part of an overall illegal \nor tortious activity at the time that he provides the \nassistance.\u201d  Id. at 486 (emphasis added) (quoting \nHalberstam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472, 477 (D.C. Cir. \n1983)).  Accordingly, to state a claim, Respondents \nneeded to plausibly allege that Petitioner was aware \nof a link between the Three Customers and Hamas \u201cat \nthe time\u201d Petitioner allegedly provided services to \nthem.  Id. (citation omitted).  But they failed to do so, \neven though their complaint was filed more than \nfifteen years after the latest of the attacks.  \nPetitioner made this point clearly and repeatedly \nthroughout the proceedings below.  Before moving to \ndismiss, Petitioner submitted a three-page letter \nsummarizing the grounds for its contemplated motion, \nas required by the District Court\u2019s Individual \nPractices.  JA.142-47.  Petitioner\u2019s lead argument was \nthat the complaint did not plausibly allege the general \nawareness element necessary to state their JASTA \n\n8 \n \nclaim.  JA.144.2  This argument, in turn, relied on the \ncomplaint\u2019s failure to allege that Petitioner was aware \nof any connection between the Three Customers and \nHamas before the attacks\u2014that is, by August 19, \n2003.  JA.145.  The complaint acknowledged that the \nThree Customers \u201cengaged in actual charitable work.\u201d  \nJA.143.  They were only \u201clater linked to Hamas.\u201d  Id.   \nIn response to this letter, Respondents chose not to \namend.  See JA.148-55.  They instead stood on the \nallegations in their complaint.  See id. \nAt a pre-motion conference, the District Court \nasked Respondents\u2019 counsel: \u201cAre there any additional \nfacts you could add to the allegations that the \ndefendant is challenging here or are you comfortable \nstanding on your complaint as it is?\u201d  Pet.App.93 \n(emphasis added).  Respondents\u2019 counsel declined the \nCourt\u2019s invitation: \u201cNo, I think we are prepared to \nbrief it based on the arguments presented in the pre-\nmotion letter.\u201d  Id.  The Court then asked whether \nRespondents would seek leave to amend if the Court \ngranted \nPetitioner\u2019s \nmotion \nto \ndismiss. \n \nId.  \nRespondents\u2019 counsel unequivocally stated that they \n\u201cwould not seek leave to amend.\u201d  Pet.App.94. \nAfter the conference, the District Court issued an \norder memorializing the fact that the court \u201coffered \n[Respondents] \nan \nopportunity \nto \namend \ntheir \n \n2  Petitioner also argued that Respondents failed to plausibly \nallege the knowing provision of substantial assistance to the \nalleged terrorist activities or any facts suggesting that \nPetitioner\u2019s routine banking services directly assisted the acts \nthat caused Respondents\u2019 injuries.  JA.145-47; see also Twitter, \n598 U.S. at 506 (summarizing principles of aiding-and-abetting \nliability under JASTA). \n\n9 \n \ncomplaint\u201d to \u201cadd additional information in response \nto the arguments raised by [Petitioner],\u201d but they \n\u201cdeclined to do so and represented that they would not \nbe seeking to amend their Complaint in this regard.\u201d  \nJA.156.  Respondents stuck to that position, and they \ndid not seek leave to amend their complaint. \nA few weeks later, Petitioner moved to dismiss \nconsistent with its pre-motion letter.  JA.159.  Among \nother arguments, it reiterated that the complaint \nfailed to plausibly allege that Petitioner knew of the \nThree Customers\u2019 purported affiliation with Hamas \nbefore the alleged attacks.  JA.160-61, 174-85.  \nRespondents opposed that motion and, in doing so, \nonce again stood on their papers.  JA.197-241.  They \ndid not move to amend or ask for an opportunity to \nreplead \nshould \nthe \nDistrict \nCourt \nfind \ntheir \nallegations lacking. \nThe District Court then held oral argument.  \nPet.App.100.  There, Petitioner\u2019s counsel again \nemphasized the complaint\u2019s failure to connect the \nThree Customers to Hamas \u201cat the time of any of the \nattacks.\u201d  Pet.App.109.  \u201cAt the very most, what the \ncomplaint alleges is that BLOM provided financial \nservices to three entities, two of which were later \ndetermined by the [U.S.] government to have provided \nfinancial support to [Hamas].\u201d  Pet.App.108 (emphasis \nadded). \nThe District Court pressed Respondents\u2019 counsel \non this pleading deficiency, asking \u201c[w]here do you \nallege in your complaint that BLOM Bank knew that \nthese account holders are alter egos or are a part of, or \nthe same as [Hamas]?\u201d  Pet.App.121.  The District \nCourt then offered Respondents\u2019 counsel yet another \n\n10 \n \nopportunity to amend the complaint, specifically with \nrespect to Petitioner\u2019s alleged \u201cknowledge\u201d: \nThe Court: I do recall that you did not want an \nopportunity to try to replead . . . . And I think \nthe Second Circuit may not encourage district \ncourts to allow another round of pleading if \nthere\u2019s been a declination of an opportunity to \nreplead . . . . So everything I need to consider in \nterms of sufficiency of your pleading is going to \nbe found in the complaint that\u2019s filed in this \ncase, correct? \nMr. Radine: Yes, Your Honor.  The\u2014 \nThe Court: There are no facts that you would \nhave to offer to address some of the contentions \nof \nthe \ndefendants \nregarding \nknowledge, \nespecially? \nMr. Radine: I think we could always add \nallegations, but the\u2014we believe the complaint \ngoes far enough in saying that BLOM . . . was \ngenerally aware of its role in th[e] [il]licit \nconduct . . . . \nPet.App.124-25 (emphasis added). \nThe District Court granted Petitioner\u2019s motion to \ndismiss, holding in relevant part that Respondents \nhad not \u201cplausibly allege[d] that [Petitioner] was \ngenerally aware of any connection between the Three \nCustomers and Hamas\u201d \u201cat the time it provided \nfinancial \nservices \nto \nthe \nThree \nCustomers.\u201d  \nPet.App.73-75.   \nThe court noted that it \u201ctypically grants plaintiffs \nan opportunity to amend their complaints following \ndismissal, to address any deficiencies raised by the \n\n11 \n \nCourt\u2019s order.\u201d  Pet.App.85.  However, Respondents \nhere \u201c[did] not request leave to amend, and specifically \ndeclined the Court\u2019s offer to do so.\u201d  Id.  Accordingly, \n\u201c[i]n \nlight \nof \n[Respondents\u2019] \nrejection \nof \nthe \nopportunity to amend their pleading at the pre-motion \nconference, and the fact that they ha[d] not identified \nany additional facts they could allege which would \naddress the deficiencies in their complaint,\u201d the \nDistrict Court dismissed the complaint with prejudice.  \nPet.App.86.   \nB. Respondents\u2019 Initial Appeal to the Second \nCircuit \nRather than request leave to amend or file a Rule \n59(e) \nmotion \nfor \nreconsideration, \nRespondents \nappealed.  In that appeal, they did not challenge the \nDistrict Court\u2019s decision to dismiss without leave to \namend.  Pet.App.16 n.4.  They instead doubled down \non their argument that their existing allegations were \nenough to \u201cstate a claim to relief that is plausible on \nits face.\u201d  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) \n(citation omitted).   \nAfter oral argument, the Second Circuit held the \nappeal in abeyance pending its decision in Kaplan v. \nLebanese Canadian Bank, SAL, 999 F.3d 842 (2d Cir. \n2021).  It also ordered the parties to submit \nsupplemental briefs addressing the significance of \nthat decision.  JA.257-58.  At this point, Respondents \nhad yet another opportunity to ask the appellate court \nto remand or grant them leave to amend in light of the \nKaplan decision.  Once again, though, they did \nneither.  They instead relied on their complaint as pled \nand insisted that the allegations therein stated a \nclaim.  JA.259-81.   \n\n12 \n \nThe Second Circuit affirmed the District Court\u2019s \ndismissal because the complaint\u2019s \u201callegations [did] \nnot support an inference that [Petitioner] was aware \nof the Three Customers\u2019 ties with Hamas prior to the \nrelevant attacks.\u201d  Pet.App.49.  Respondents did not \nseek rehearing.  Nor did they belatedly request that \nthe Second Circuit modify its decision to remand and \npermit Respondents leave to amend the complaint. \nC. The Post-Judgment Proceedings \nRespondents instead returned to the District Court \nand moved to vacate the District Court\u2019s now-affirmed \njudgment under Rule 60(b)(6) so they could amend \ntheir complaint and return to square one.  JA.315-22.  \nThe District Court held a pre-motion conference, at \nwhich it ordered briefing \u201conly as to the issue of \nvacatur.\u201d  JA.509.   \nAfter briefing, the District Court held that \n\u201c[Respondents] \nhave \nnot \ndemonstrated \nany \nextraordinary circumstances warranting relief under \nRule 60(b)(6).\u201d  Pet.App.14.  It also explained that \nRespondents had not demonstrated that they would \nsuffer an \u201cextreme and undue hardship\u201d from letting \nthe judgment stand because they \u201chave had ample \nopportunity to pursue all legal avenues available to \nthem for relief.\u201d  Pet.App.15-16 (quotation marks \nomitted).  \u201cFundamentally, [Respondents] seek to \namend their complaint after declining two prior \nopportunities to do so, and after unsuccessfully \nappealing the dismissal of that complaint with \nprejudice.\u201d  Pet.App.16.  And they sought to start the \nprocess all over again on the sole basis that they \nwished to plead new facts that were previously \navailable.  Pet.App.15.  The District Court thus \n\n13 \n \ndecided, in its discretion, to leave the final judgment \nin place given Respondents\u2019 \u201cdocumented series of \ndeliberate choices not to cure the deficiencies \nidentified in their pleading by [Petitioner] and [the \nDistrict] Court.\u201d  Pet.App.19.  \nRespondents appealed again.  Petitioner defended \nthe District Court\u2019s ruling by arguing that Rule \n60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent standards governed Respondents\u2019 \nmotion, that Rule 15(a) had no role to play in that \nanalysis, and that Respondents fell far short of \ndemonstrating \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d given \ntheir many earlier refusals to seek leave to amend.  \nSee 2d Cir. Dkt. No. 42, at 37-49, 55-59.  After oral \nargument, the Second Circuit issued its decision in \nMandala, 88 F.4th 353.   \nIn Mandala, a split panel held that, when a losing \nparty seeks post-judgment relief under Rule 60(b)(6) \nto amend its complaint, a district court must balance \nRule 60(b)(6)\u2019s finality principles with Rule 15(a)(2)\u2019s \n\u201cliberal amendment policy.\u201d  Id. at 361 (quoting \nWilliams v. Citigroup Inc., 659 F.3d 208, 213 (2d Cir. \n2011) (per curiam)).  And, where a losing party has not \nyet filed an amended complaint, the Second Circuit \nheld that it is an abuse of discretion for a district court \nto deny a Rule 60(b)(6) motion based solely on the \nmovant\u2019s \u201cfailure to demonstrate adequate grounds for \nrelief under Rule 60.\u201d  Id. at 362 & n.5.  In doing so, \nthe court flipped the burden from Rule 60 movants \n(who \nnormally \nmust \nprove \nextraordinary \ncircumstances) to their opponent (to show that the \nmovant should not receive another bite at the apple).  \nAs Judge Sullivan explained in dissent, that defies \n\u201cthe principle that Rule 60(b)(6) affords litigants an \n\n14 \n \nextraordinary remedy and effectively holds that such \nrelief is available in the ordinary course.\u201d  Id. at 368 \n(Sullivan, J., dissenting).  Judge Sullivan also \nexplained that the Second Circuit\u2019s approach \u201cerode[s] \nthe finality of judgments,\u201d \u201csignificantly undermine[s] \nthe important purposes served by Rule 60(b),\u201d and \n\u201cincrease[s] the workload of busy district court judges \nwho carry the heaviest burden in our system of civil \njustice.\u201d  Id. at 369. \nThe Second Circuit then applied and reaffirmed \nMandala\u2019s balancing test in the decision below.  It held \nthat \u201cthe district court exceeded its discretion by \nbasing its ruling on an erroneous view of the law \nbecause it failed to balance Rule 60(b)\u2019s finality \nprinciples \nand \nRule \n15(a)\u2019s \nliberal \npleading \nprinciples.\u201d  Pet.App.7-8.  When presented with a \nmotion to vacate for the purposes of amendment, the \nSecond Circuit said, \u201cthe district court is required to \nconsider Rule 60(b) finality and Rule 15(a) liberality \nin tandem.\u201d  Pet.App.7.  Thus, the Second Circuit held \nthat the District Court abused its discretion because it \nanalyzed the Rule 60(b) motion here \u201cunder only Rule \n60(b)\u2019s standard.\u201d  Id. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s outlier approach contradicts \nthe text, structure, and history of the Federal Rules, \nand it violates decades of this Court\u2019s precedents.  It \njettisons Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s well-settled and exacting \n\u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d \nstandard \nfor \na \nnebulous balancing test that wrongly smuggles Rule \n15(a)\u2019s \u201cliberal pleading principles\u201d into the calculus \nfor vacating a final judgment.  The decision below \nshould therefore be reversed, and the District Court\u2019s \n\n15 \n \ndenial of Respondents\u2019 Rule 60(b)(6) motion should be \nreinstated so this case can finally come to an end. \nI.  A party seeking to set aside an affirmed \njudgment for the purpose of filing an amended \ncomplaint must first satisfy Rule 60(b)\u2019s stringent \nstandards for vacating the judgment.  That common-\nsense position has been adopted by every other Court \nof Appeals.  And the Second Circuit\u2019s contrary \nbalancing approach is fundamentally mistaken. \nA.  Rule 60(b) imposes an intentionally high hurdle \nfor relief\u2014and understandably so.  This Court has \nlong underscored the profound importance of finality \nto our civil justice system.  After all, litigants, courts, \nand the public alike all share an interest in the \nconclusiveness of judgments and the peace and repose \nthat such finality brings.  Courts since the Founding \nhave thus consistently refused to reopen matters that \nhave been litigated to final judgment\u2014except in the \nmost compelling circumstances. \nRule 60(b) is rooted in that tradition.  It codified \nmany of the narrow, common-law exceptions for relief \nfrom a final judgment, along with a catchall in Rule \n60(b)(6) for similarly extraordinary circumstances \nthat are not explicitly covered by subsections \n(1) through (5).  Rule 60(b) therefore demands a \nscrupulous regard for finality.  Indeed, this Court has \nrepeatedly emphasized that Rule 60(b)(6) requires \n\u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d to justify vacating a \nfinal judgment.  See, e.g., Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 536. \nThat is the standard that applies here.  Rule 60(b) \nprovides the exclusive mechanism for \u201cRelief from a \nFinal Judgment\u201d more than 28 days after entry.  And \nRule 15(a) has no place in that inquiry.  Instead, Rule \n\n16 \n \n15(a) is limited to \u201cAmendments Before Trial.\u201d  There \nis not even a pending complaint to amend when an \naction has been finally dismissed with prejudice.  The \nsuit is over, and the claim is extinguished by the \ndoctrine of res judicata. \nAccordingly, plaintiffs cannot reopen a final \njudgment by invoking Rule 15(a)\u2019s policies without \nfirst meeting Rule 60(b)\u2019s restrictive standards.  And \nwhere, as here, plaintiffs seek relief under Rule \n60(b)(6), \nthey \nmust \nshow \n\u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d not covered by any other provision of \nRule 60(b).  To hold otherwise would enable plaintiffs \nto sidestep Rule 60(b)\u2019s deliberately narrow grounds \nfor post-judgment relief and thwart the Rule\u2019s respect \nfor finality. \nB.  Moreover, this Court has long held that a party \nmust be \u201cfaultless\u201d to obtain relief under Rule 60(b)(6).  \nPioneer Inv. Servs., 507 U.S. at 393; see Ackermann, \n340 U.S. at 197-202.  That is because Rule 60(b)(1) \nspecifically authorizes motions for relief premised on \n\u201cmistake, \ninadvertence, \nsurprise, \nor \nexcusable \nneglect,\u201d while strictly limiting the window for \nbringing such a motion to one year after judgment.  \nRule 60(b)(6) cannot be used to circumvent those \nlimitations.  If it could, then Rule 60(b)\u2019s provision for \n\u201cexcusable neglect\u201d would become superfluous. \nNor can Rule 60(b)(6) be used to circumvent basic \nprinciples of waiver.  That has been firmly settled by \nthis Court for decades.  See Ackermann, 340 U.S. at \n197-98.  Accordingly, where a plaintiff deliberately \nwaives the right to amend its complaint in the \nordinary course, it cannot seek a mulligan post-\n\n17 \n \njudgment after that considered choice has led to a \ndismissal with prejudice. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s outlier approach nullifies \nthese foundational principles.  Rather than requiring \nthe moving party to be faultless, the Second Circuit \nhas crafted a muddled balancing test that saves \nplaintiffs from their own litigation choices.  And the \ncourt has eschewed finality even where\u2014as here\u2014the \nmoving parties repeatedly and explicitly declined to \namend their complaint before judgment.  \nC.  The Second Circuit provided no persuasive \njustification for its balancing test.   \n1. It never even attempted to ground its analysis \nin the text of the Federal Rules.  In fact, as noted \nabove, its approach is at odds with the text and context \nof both Rule 15(a) and Rule 60(b). \n2. Moreover, by diluting Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s standard \nwith Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal repleading policy, the Second \nCircuit rendered Rule 60(b) internally inconsistent in \nat least three ways.  First, its balancing test enables \nplaintiffs to evade the one-year limitations period for \nRule 60(b) motions premised on \u201cexcusable neglect,\u201d \nby compelling district courts to reopen final judgments \noutside that timeframe based on previously omitted \nallegations.  Second, it thwarts the time limits for Rule \n60(b) motions premised on \u201cmistake\u201d of law or fact that \noccurred in the initial proceedings.  Third, it allows \nparties to reopen proceedings based on factual \nallegations they could have made pre-judgment\u2014even \nthough Rule 60(b)(2) specifically limits relief based on \nnew facts to those that could not have been previously \ndiscovered through due diligence.  \n\n18 \n \n3. The Second Circuit\u2019s test finds no support in \nprecedent either.  The decision below relied on Foman \nv. Davis, 371 U.S. 178 (1962).  But Foman is \ninapposite.  That case involved a Rule 59(e) motion, \nwhile this case concerns a Rule 60(b) motion.  There is \nno reason to conflate the standards for those two rules.  \nRules 59(e) and 60(b) differ in material ways and \nimpose different standards for relief by their own \nterms.  So this Court has refused to treat Rule 59(e) \nand Rule 60(b) motions as fungible.  See Banister v. \nDavis, 590 U.S. 504, 517-21 (2020). \n4. Finally, \neven \nif \nany \ninterpretive \ndoubt \nremained, this Court must \u201cconstrue[]\u201d the Rules to \n\u201csecure \nthe \njust, \nspeedy, \nand \ninexpensive \ndetermination of every action.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 1.  Far \nfrom advancing these overarching objectives, the \nSecond Circuit\u2019s test destroys them.  It allows the \nreopening of final judgments after plaintiffs have \nwillingly induced the judiciary to render a final \njudgment (and here an appellate ruling) based on their \noperative pleadings.  It thus invites a wasteful \nfeedback loop of relitigation.  As this case shows, that \napproach is neither just nor speedy nor inexpensive.   \nAt bottom, the Second Circuit erred in collapsing \nthe Rule 15(a) and Rule 60(b) inquiries.  The two rules \npose distinct hurdles.  The former applies before final \njudgment, and the latter applies after final judgment.  \nAs a result, Respondents could not seek leave to \namend unless they first proved \u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d beyond their control that would justify \nthe reopening of the final judgment dismissing their \ncase, which had already been affirmed on appeal. \n\n19 \n \nII. Respondents came nowhere close to meeting \nthat stringent standard\u2014and the District Court \ncertainly did not abuse its discretion in so finding. \nA.  There are no extraordinary circumstances here.  \nRespondents do not dispute that their late-breaking \nallegations were previously available to them.  They \nmerely argue that the Second Circuit \u201cclarified\u201d the \npleading standard for JASTA claims in their appeal.  \nBut the Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal with \nprejudice because\u2014as the District Court recognized\u2014\nRespondents failed to plausibly allege that Petitioner \nknew of the Three Customers\u2019 supposed connection to \nHamas at the time it allegedly provided routine \nbanking services to them.  And, in all events, mere \nclarification of the law is not extraordinary.  It is what \nappellate courts do day in and day out.  Indeed, this \nCourt has held that even an outright change in the law \ndoes not warrant relief under Rule 60(b)(6).  See \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. at 537.  The District Court thus did \nnot abuse its discretion in finding a lack of \nextraordinary circumstances. \nB.  On the contrary, the District Court would have \nnecessarily abused its discretion had it granted \nRespondents\u2019 motion.  This Court has made clear that \nit is an abuse of discretion to override a party\u2019s \ndeliberate waiver.  Here, Respondents waived or \nforfeited multiple opportunities to amend their \ncomplaint.  They first explicitly rejected the District \nCourt\u2019s invitation to amend at the pre-motion \nconference, after Petitioner had already pointed out \nthe \ndeficiencies \nin \nRespondents\u2019 \npleadings.  \nRespondents again rebuffed the District Court\u2019s \ninvitation to amend at oral argument.  They declined \n\n20 \n \nto file a Rule 59(e) motion to ask the District Court for \na chance to replead after they lost.  They chose not to \nappeal the \u201cwith prejudice\u201d component of the District \nCourt\u2019s dismissal.  And they never asked the Second \nCircuit for leave to replead if the court found their \nallegations lacking\u2014not in their opening brief, not in \ntheir reply brief, not at oral argument, and not in their \nsupplemental brief.   \nRespondents were thus far from faultless in the \ndelay.  Their own deliberate choices created the \ncircumstances from which they now seek relief.  Rule \n60(b)(6) does not save them from those strategic and \n\u201cvoluntary\u201d decisions.  Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 200.  \nGiven their repeated waivers of the chance to amend, \nRespondents could not even satisfy the more forgiving \nstandard for relief under Rule 59(e). \nFor all these reasons, this Court should reverse the \ndecision below and render judgment for Petitioner. \nARGUMENT \nI. A Party Seeking To Vacate A Final Judgment \nFor Purposes Of Amendment Must First \nSatisfy Rule 60(b). \nRelying on a series of Second Circuit precedents, \nthe decision below held that the District Court abused \nits discretion by \u201crequiring Plaintiffs to successfully \nnavigate Rule 60(b)\u2019s finality gauntlet before they \ncould invoke Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal repleading policy.\u201d  \nPet.App.8.  That, however, is precisely what the \nDistrict Court was obligated to do.  The Second \nCircuit\u2019s contrary position cannot be squared with \nRule 60(b)\u2019s text, its broader context, or this Court\u2019s \nprecedents.  It has thus been unanimously rejected by \n\n21 \n \nevery other Court of Appeals.3  That overwhelming \nmajority view is correct, and the Second Circuit\u2019s \noutlier balancing test is wrong. \nA. Rule 60(b)(6) Requires a Movant to Show \n\u201cExtraordinary Circumstances.\u201d \nThis Court has long extolled the importance of \nfinality to our system of justice.  Indeed, \u201cthe very \nobject for which civil courts have been established\u201d is \n\u201cto secure the peace and repose of society by the \nsettlement \nof \nmatters \ncapable \nof \njudicial \ndetermination.\u201d  Southern Pac. R.R. Co. v. United \nStates, 168 U.S. 1, 49 (1897).  \u201c[T]he aid of judicial \ntribunals would not be invoked\u201d if \u201cconclusiveness did \nnot attend the judgments of such tribunals.\u201d  Id.  For \nthat reason, courts since the Founding have \nrecognized that only \u201ca very strong case\u201d may justify \ndisturbing \u201cthe public interest and policy to make an \nend to litigation.\u201d  Ocean Ins.

Farrand ed., 1807). \nThat understanding persisted up through the \nadoption of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in \n1938.  By that time, a patchwork of methods had \ndeveloped for litigants seeking relief after a court\u2019s \nentry of final judgment and the expiration of the term.  \nSee Comment, Temporal Aspects of the Finality of \nJudgments\u2014The Significance of Federal Rule 60(b), \n17 U. Chi. L. Rev. 664, 664-65 (1950).  But courts \nalways remained \u201ccautious in exercising their power\u201d \nto reopen settled matters.  Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. \nHartford-Empire Co., 322 U.S. 238, 244 (1944).  Relief \ncontinued to be reserved only for \u201ccertain limited \nsituations.\u201d  James Wm. Moore & Elizabeth B. A. \nRogers, Federal Relief from Civil Judgments, 55 Yale \nL.J. 623, 627 (1946). \nRule 60(b) codifies many of these \u201cwell-recognized \nand concrete exceptions to the finality principle.\u201d  \nMary Kay Kane, Relief from Federal Judgments: A \nMorass Unrelieved by a Rule, 30 Hastings L.J. 41, 43 \n(1978); see Banister, 590 U.S. at 518.  These specific \nexceptions \ninclude \n(1) \u201cmistake, \ninadvertence, \nsurprise, or excusable neglect,\u201d (2) \u201cnewly discovered \nevidence,\u201d (3) \u201cfraud,\u201d (4) a \u201cvoid\u201d judgment, or \n(5) situations where \u201cthe judgment has been satisfied, \nreleased, or discharged; it is based on an earlier \njudgment that has been reversed or vacated; or \napplying it prospectively is no longer equitable.\u201d  Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 60(b)(1)-(5).  Rule 60(b) also includes a \n\n23 \n \ncatchall provision for \u201cany other reason that justifies \nrelief.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6). \nThat final subsection\u2019s berth has been tightly \ncircumscribed.  \u201cWhen faced with a catchall phrase \nlike [Rule 60(b)(6)], courts do not necessarily afford it \nthe broadest possible construction it can bear.\u201d  \nHarrington v. Purdue Pharma L.P., 144 S. Ct. 2071, \n2082 (2024).  That is because readers \u201cgenerally \nappreciate that the catchall must be interpreted in \nlight of its surrounding context and read to \u2018embrace \nonly objects similar in nature\u2019 to the specific examples \npreceding it.\u201d  Id. (quoting Epic Sys. Corp. v. Lewis, \n584 U.S. 497, 512 (2018)); accord Hall St. Assocs., \nL.L.C. v. Mattel, Inc., 552 U.S. 576, 586 (2008). \nConsistent with that \u201cancient interpretive principle\u201d \nof ejusdem generis, Harrington, 144 S. Ct. at 2082, this \nCourt has long construed Rule 60(b)(6) to authorize \nrelief from a final judgment only in similarly \n\u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d that are not otherwise \nspecifically covered by the Rule, Ackermann, 340 U.S. \nat 199.  The Court has emphasized that stringent \nrequirement time and again in an unbroken line of \ndecisions.  See Kemp v. United States, 596 U.S. 528, \n533 (2022); Tharpe v. Sellers, 583 U.S. 33, 35 (2018) \n(per curiam); Buck v. Davis, 580 U.S. 100, 123 (2017); \nChristeson v. Roper, 574 U.S. 373, 380 (2015) (per \ncuriam); Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 535; Agostini v. Felton, \n521 U.S. 203, 239 (1997); Pioneer Inv. Servs., 507 U.S. \nat 393; Liljeberg v. Health Servs. Acquisition Corp., \n486 U.S. 847, 863 n.11, 864 (1988); Ackermann, 340 \nU.S. at 199; Klapprott v. United States, 335 U.S. 601, \n613-14 (1949).   \n\n24 \n \n\u201cThis very strict interpretation of Rule 60(b) is \nessential if the finality of judgments is to be \npreserved.\u201d  Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 535 (quoting \nLiljeberg, \n486 \nU.S. \nat \n873 \n(Rehnquist, \nC.J., \ndissenting)).  And this Court has left no room for Rule \n15\u2019s liberal amendment policy to creep into the \nequation.  For good reason:  Rule 60(b) is carefully \ncrafted to provide a mechanism only for those rare \n\u201csituations in which relief must be obtained after \njudgment,\u201d and \u201cthe broad amendment policy of Rule \n15(a) should not be construed in a manner that would \nrender [that] provision[] meaningless.\u201d  6 Wright & \nMiller, Federal Practice & Procedure \u00a7 1489 (3d ed. \n2024).  \u201cTo hold otherwise would enable the liberal \namendment policy of Rule 15(a) to be employed in a \nway that is contrary to the philosophy favoring finality \nof judgments and the expeditious termination of \nlitigation\u201d that the Rules were designed to promote.  \nTool Box, Inc. v. Ogden City Corp., 419 F.3d 1084, 1087 \n(10th Cir. 2005) (quoting 6 Wright & Miller, Federal \nPractice & Procedure \u00a7 1489 (2d ed. 1990)); see Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 1. \nThis understanding is also consistent with Rule \n15(a)\u2019s text, history, and structure.  By its terms, Rule \n15(a) provides a liberal repleading policy only \u201cbefore \ntrial.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a) (capitalization altered).  Up \nuntil that point in the litigation, courts \u201cshould freely \ngive leave\u201d to amend a complaint \u201cwhen justice so \nrequires.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2).  This policy \nfacilitates having claims \u201cdecided on [their] merits \nrather than on procedural technicalities.\u201d  6 Wright & \nMiller, supra, \u00a7 1471 (3d ed.).   \n\n25 \n \nBut that liberal pre-trial policy evaporates post-\njudgment.  After all, \u201ca trial court\u2019s final judgment \n\u2018resolves conclusively the substance of all claims, \nrights, and liabilities of all parties to an action\u2019 and \n\u2018ends the litigation on the merits\u2019 in the district court.\u201d  \nBoyd v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corrs., 114 F.4th 1232, 1237 \n(11th Cir. 2024) (citation omitted).  \u201cSo once the court \nhas entered final judgment, Rule 15(a) no longer \napplies and no amendment is possible unless the \njudgment is first set aside.\u201d  Id.  And, where the \nplaintiff seeks vacatur through Rule 60(b)(6), \n\u201cextraordinary circumstances must justify reopening.\u201d  \nKemp, 596 U.S. at 533 (quotation marks omitted).  \nOnly after making that threshold showing to vacate \nthe judgment may the plaintiff seek leave to amend \nunder Rule 15(a)\u2019s standard.  \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s contrary rule breaks from this \nCourt\u2019s precedents, the history and structure of the \nFederal Rules, and every one of its sister Circuits.  It \nabandons the \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d standard \nin favor of a nebulous \u201cbalanc[ing]\u201d inquiry that pits \nRule 60(b)(6)\u2019s protection of \u201cfinality\u201d against \u201cRule \n15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policies.\u201d  Pet.App.8.  And \nit loads the dice in that balancing test against finality, \nproviding that district courts necessarily abuse their \ndiscretion by \u201cdenying post-judgment relief\u201d based on \nthe movant\u2019s \u201cfailure to demonstrate adequate \ngrounds for relief under Rule 60.\u201d  Mandala, 88 F.4th \nat 362 & n.5. \nNot only does that defy this Court\u2019s precedent, but \nit also violates the cardinal principle that \u201c[c]ourts are \nrequired to give effect to Congress\u2019 express inclusions \nand exclusions, not disregard them.\u201d  Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of \n\n26 \n \nMfrs. v. Dep\u2019t of Def., 583 U.S. 109, 126 (2018).  In Rule \n15(a)(2), Congress adopted this Court\u2019s instruction to \n\u201cfreely give leave\u201d to amend before trial.  Fed. R. Civ. \nP. \n15(a)(2). \n \nBut \nCongress \nand \nthis \nCourt \nconspicuously chose not to do the same in Rule 60(b) \nwhen delineating the \u201cgrounds for relief from a final \njudgment.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) (capitalization \naltered).  The implication from that differing language \nis thus straightforward.  When a plaintiff seeks to \n\u201creopen a final judgment,\u201d as here, \u201cthe policy favoring \nthe finality of judgments [is] implicated,\u201d and \u201c[t]he \npermissive policy favoring amendment under Rule 15 \n[is] simply not relevant.\u201d  Garrett v. Wexford Health, \n938 F.3d 69, 86 (3d Cir. 2019) (emphasis added).  \nIndeed, \u201cthere is no pending complaint to amend\u201d once \n\u201cthe action has been dismissed\u201d with prejudice.  \nCalvary Christian Ctr. v. City of Fredericksburg, 710 \nF.3d 536, 540 (4th Cir. 2013); see also, e.g., Pe\u00f1a v. \nMattox, 84 F.3d 894, 903 (7th Cir. 1996); Fisher v. \nKadant, Inc., 589 F.3d 505, 509 (1st Cir. 2009).  The \nmatter is closed, the claim is \u201cextinguishe[d],\u201d and res \njudicata generally \u201cbar[s] a subsequent action on that \nclaim.\u201d  Cooper v. Fed. Rsrv. Bank of Richmond, 467 \nU.S. 867, 874 (1984). \nAs a result, the \u201cmore restrictive standard\u201d for \ngranting a Rule 60(b) motion \u201cmust be satisfied before \nconsideration can be given to a motion to amend.\u201d  \nDaulatzai, 97 F.4th at 179 (emphasis added).  \nOtherwise, as now-Chief Judge Sutton has explained, \nplaintiffs could \u201csidestep the narrow grounds for \nobtaining post-judgment relief\u201d under Rule 60(b), \n\u201cmake the finality of judgments an interim concept,\u201d \nand risk turning Rule 60(b) into a \u201cnullit[y].\u201d  Leisure \nCaviar, LLC v. U.S. Fish & Wildlife Serv., 616 F.3d \n\n27 \n \n612, 616 (6th Cir. 2010).  There is no good reason for \n\u201cjudgment finality\u201d to be so \u201clightly cast aside.\u201d  United \nStates v. Denedo, 556 U.S. 904, 916 (2009).   \nB. Rule 60(b)(6) Provides No Basis for Relief \nfrom a Party\u2019s Free, Calculated Choices. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s rebuke of the \u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d test suffers from another shortcoming.  \nIt \ndefies \nthe \nrequirement \nthat \nthe \nalleged \n\u201c\u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019\u201d be such \u201cthat the \n[moving] party is faultless in the delay.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. \nServs., 507 U.S. at 393 (citation omitted); see \nAckermann, 340 U.S. at 198.  Put another way:  The \nmovant must be \u201ccompletely without fault for his or \nher predicament\u201d and \u201cunable to have taken any steps \nthat would have resulted in preventing the judgment \nfrom which relief is sought.\u201d  12 James Wm. Moore et \nal., Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00a7 60.48[3][b] (3d ed. \n2024).  A party that is even \u201cpartly to blame for the \ndelay\u201d cannot obtain relief under Rule 60(b)(6).  \nPioneer Inv. Servs., 507 U.S. at 393. \nThat requirement fits neatly within the broader \ncontext of Rule 60(b).  After all, Rule 60(b)(6) \u201cis \navailable only when Rules 60(b)(1) through (b)(5) are \ninapplicable.\u201d  Kemp, 596 U.S. at 533.  That narrow, \nresidual role for the catchall clause respects the plain \nmeaning of its \u201c\u2018other reason\u2019 language\u201d and \n\u201cprevent[s] clause (6) from being used to circumvent \nthe 1-year limitations period\u201d that applies to clauses \n(1) through (3).  Liljeberg, 486 U.S. at 863 n.11; see \nFed. R. Civ. P. 60(c)(1).  One of those time-limited \ncircumstances is for \u201cexcusable neglect.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 60(b)(1).  Thus, \u201ca party who failed to take timely \naction due to \u2018excusable neglect\u2019 may not seek relief \n\n28 \n \nmore than a year after the judgment by resorting to \nsubsection (6).\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs., 507 U.S. at 393.  \nIf it could, then the \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d provision and \nits limitations would become \u201csuperfluous\u201d and \n\u201cinsignificant.\u201d  TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U.S. 19, 31 \n(2001) (citation omitted).  Such an interpretation \u201cis of \ncourse to be avoided.\u201d  Dastar Corp. v. Twentieth \nCentury Fox Film Corp., 539 U.S. 23, 35 (2003). \nSo too is any interpretation that would excuse a \nparty\u2019s voluntary waiver of a court\u2019s invitation to \namend.  The \u201cusual federal rule of waiver\u201d applies \nregardless of \u201cprejudice\u201d to the party that \u201cknowingly \nrelinquish[ed]\u201d his rights.  Morgan v. Sundance, Inc., \n596 U.S. 411, 417-19 (2022).  And this Court has made \nclear that \u201c[i]t would be \u2018an abuse of discretion\u2019\u201d to \n\u201c\u2018override a [party\u2019s] deliberative waiver.\u2019\u201d  Wood v. \nMilyard, 566 U.S. 463, 472-73 (2012) (quoting Day v. \nMcDonough, 547 U.S. 198, 202 (2006)). \nRule 60(b)(6) is no exception.  As this Court held \nlong ago, parties \u201ccannot be relieved of [their] \nchoice[s]\u201d through that mechanism simply \u201cbecause \nhindsight seems to indicate\u201d the improvidence of their \ndecisions.  Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 198.  A party\u2019s \nwaiver of the right to amend in the normal course\u2014\nlike Respondents\u2019 repeated waivers here\u2014thus cannot \njustify relief from the entry of a final judgment that \nresults from that party\u2019s \u201cconsidered choice.\u201d  Id. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s tortured approach violates \nthese basic principles of waiver.  By requiring district \ncourts to consider Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberality policy in \ntandem with Rule 60\u2019s regard for finality\u2014even when \nthe movant has consistently and consciously rejected \nnumerous invitations and opportunities to amend\u2014\n\n29 \n \nthe Second Circuit has directed district courts to \noverride and rescue parties from their \u201cfree, \ncalculated, [and] deliberate choices.\u201d  Id.  That is \nprecisely the sort of unfair and inefficient relitigation \nloop that this Court has repeatedly warned against.  \n\u201cThere must be an end to litigation someday,\u201d and a \nlitigant\u2019s strategic choices \u201care not to be relieved \nfrom.\u201d  Id. \nC. The Second Circuit\u2019s Outlier Balancing \nTest Is Untenable. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s approach cannot be squared \nwith any of this.  The decision below held that \nRespondents \nneed \nnot \nshow \n\u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d to reopen the final judgment entered \nagainst \nthem \nbecause, \nin \nits \nview, \n\u201cspecial \nconsiderations come into play\u201d when \u201cvacatur is \nsought in order to obtain leave to file an amended \ncomplaint.\u201d  Pet.App.7 (quoting Mandala, 88 F.4th at \n361).  But the court failed to root these supposedly \nspecial considerations in text, context, or precedent.  \nAnd it contradicted each of those sources of legal \nauthority along the way. \n1. The Second Circuit\u2019s Test Is Atextual. \nMost notably, the Second Circuit\u2019s balancing test is \nunmoored from the text of the Federal Rules.  This \nCourt interprets the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \nas it would any statute.  See Bus. Guides, Inc. v. \nChromatic Commc\u2019ns Enters., Inc., 498 U.S. 533, 540-\n41 (1991).  Its analysis in that interpretive enterprise \nalways \u201cbegins with the text.\u201d  Ross v. Blake, 578 U.S. \n632, 638 (2016).  Here, however, the Second Circuit \n\n30 \n \n\u201cmade no attempt to ground its analysis\u201d in the actual \nlanguage of Rule 60(b)(6).  Id. \nNor could it.  Nothing in that Rule\u2019s text compels \ndistricts courts to give \u201c\u2018due regard\u2019 to \u2018the liberal \nspirit of Rule 15\u2019\u201d after final judgment \u201cby ensuring \nplaintiffs at least one opportunity to replead.\u201d  \nMandala, 88 F.4th at 362 (quoting Metzler Inv. GmbH \nv. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., 970 F.3d 133, 146 (2d \nCir. 2020)).  Nothing in the Federal Rules\u2019 text allows \nplaintiffs to leapfrog over \u201cRule 60(b)\u2019s finality \ngauntlet\u201d to the sanctuary of \u201cRule 15(a)\u2019s liberal \nrepleading policy.\u201d  Pet.App.8.  And nothing in the text \ncalls for any exceptions to Rule 60(b)\u2019s demanding \nstandards for \u201cRelief from a Final Judgment.\u201d  Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 60(b). \nMeanwhile, the text of Rule 15(a) expressly \nindicates that it has no role to play after judgment.  \nInstead, it applies only to \u201cAmendments Before Trial.\u201d  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 15(a); see Krupski v. Costa Crociere S. p. \nA., 560 U.S. 538, 553 (2010).  It is in that setting\u2014\nbefore trial and a final judgment\u2014that the Rules \nencourage courts to \u201cfreely give leave\u201d to amend, so \nthat the relevant factual allegations and legal issues \ncan be joined and presented at trial.  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n15(a)(2).  By contrast, Rule 15(a) does not provide any \nmechanism for amending pleadings after dismissal, \nfinal judgment, and affirmance on appeal.  At that \npoint, there are no pending pleadings to amend.  And \nalterations of the final judgment are the province of \nRule 60(b). \nThe Second Circuit thus failed to heed the plain \ntext of both Rule 15(a) and Rule 60(b) when fashioning \nits balancing test.  That led it to fault the District \n\n31 \n \nCourt for evaluating Plaintiffs\u2019 Rule 60(b) motion \n\u201cunder only Rule 60(b)\u2019s standard.\u201d  Pet.App.7.  But \nthat is exactly what the District Court was supposed \nto do.  \u201cPlaintiffs must first meet the threshold \nrequirement of 60(b)(6)\u2019s extraordinary or exceptional \ncircumstances to vacate the judgment before seeking\u201d \nto amend their pleadings.  In re Ferro Corp. Deriv. \nLitig., 511 F.3d 611, 624 (6th Cir. 2008).  The structure \nand plain text of the Federal Rules both make clear \nthat failure to meet that burden forecloses relief. \n2. The Second Circuit\u2019s Test Conflicts \nwith Other Provisions of Rule 60. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s test makes even less sense \nwhen assessed within the \u201ctotal context\u201d of Rule 60.  \nPavelic & LeFlore v. Marvel Ent. Grp., 493 U.S. 120, \n123 (1989).  A Rule 60(b) motion to reopen \u201cmust be \nmade within a reasonable time\u2014and for reasons (1), \n(2), and (3) no more than a year after the entry of the \njudgment.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(c)(1).  Yet the Second \nCircuit\u2019s balancing test for Rule 60(b)(6) enables \nlitigants to evade those explicit time limitations in at \nleast three ways. \nFirst, the Second Circuit\u2019s liberal repleading policy \npermits litigants to bypass Rule 60\u2019s strict time \nlimitations for \u201cexcusable neglect.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n60(b)(1).  If a plaintiff neglects to include certain \nallegations in his complaint and that omission is \n\u201cexcusable,\u201d then he has only one year to move to \nreopen the judgment based on that oversight through \nRule 60(b)(1).  He cannot do the same through Rule \n60(b)(6), as a party cannot \u201c\u2018avail himself\u2019\u201d of that \nprovision \u201cif his motion is based on grounds specified \nin clause (1).\u201d  Liljeberg, 486 U.S. at 863 n.11 (citation \n\n32 \n \nomitted).  But the Second Circuit allows and even \nencourages plaintiffs to do precisely that, by \ncompelling district courts to reopen actions under Rule \n60(b)(6) if the plaintiffs \u201creasonably\u201d (i.e., excusably) \nneglected to include their late-breaking allegations \nbefore final judgment.  Mandala, 88 F.4th at 359, 364.4  \nRather than embrace that misguided approach, this \nCourt \nshould \n\u201cresist\u201d \nany \ninterpretation \nthat \n\u201crender[s] [Rule 60(b)] so internally inconsistent.\u201d  \nJones v. Hendrix, 599 U.S. 465, 479 (2023) (citation \nomitted). \nSecond, the Second Circuit\u2019s balancing test serves \nas an end-run around Rule 60(b)(1)\u2019s time limits for \n\u201cmistake.\u201d  In Mandala, for instance, the Court of \nAppeals held that Rule 60(b)(1) is \u201cinapplicable\u201d\u2014and \nthat \u201c\u2018the liberal spirit of Rule 15\u2019\u201d instead kicks in\u2014\nwhen a \u201cvacatur motion arises from a legal mistake\u201d \nthat leads a plaintiff into \u201cinsufficient pleading.\u201d  88 \nF.4th at 360-62 (emphasis added; citation omitted).  \nYet, there is no reason why that form of \u201clegal mistake\u201d \nwould pull a motion outside of Rule 60(b)(1)\u2019s ambit.  \nThose who drafted and adopted the Rules \u201cchose to \ninclude \u2018mistake\u2019 unqualified.\u201d  Kemp, 596 U.S. at 534.  \n\u201cWhen the Rule was adopted in 1938 and revised in \n \n4  Of course, if a plaintiff \u201cinexcusably\u201d omitted their new \nallegations, that cannot possibly provide a \u201creason that justifies \nrelief.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6) (emphasis added); see, e.g., \nInexcusable, American College Dictionary 621 (Clarence L. \nBarnhart ed., 1953) (\u201cincapable of being justified\u201d); Inexcusable, \nWebster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary 428 (6th ed. 1949) (\u201cnot \nadmitting excuse or justification\u201d).  It is therefore \u201cclear\u201d that \n\u201cinexcusable neglect\u201d similarly \u201cdoes not justify relief under Rule \n60(b)(6).\u201d  Helm v. Resolution Tr. Corp., 84 F.3d 874, 879 (7th Cir. \n1996); see Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 202; PIRS Cap., LLC v. \nWilliams, 54 F.4th 1050, 1055 (8th Cir. 2022). \n\n33 \n \n1946, \nthe \nword \n\u2018mistake\u2019 \napplied \nto \nany \n\u2018misconception,\u2019 \u2018misunderstanding,\u2019 or \u2018fault in \nopinion or judgment.\u2019\u201d  Id. (quoting Webster\u2019s New \nInternational Dictionary 1383 (1914)).  That includes \n\u201cmistakes of law\u201d made by judges and litigants alike.  \nId. at 534-35.  The Second Circuit\u2019s atextual standard \nthus clashes with Rule 60\u2019s limited availability of \nrelief for \u201cmistake\u201d as well.  That provides yet another \ncontextual strike against it. \nThird, the Second Circuit\u2019s approach overrides \nRule 60(b)(2)\u2019s restrictions for vacatur based on new \nevidence.  That provision allows parties \u201cto reopen \nproceedings\u201d based only \u201con matter which could not \nreasonably have been previously adduced\u201d\u2014and even \nthen, only if the party presents that material within a \nyear of final judgment.  INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314, \n326 (1992); see Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(2) (\u201cnewly \ndiscovered evidence that, with reasonable diligence, \ncould not have been discovered in time to move for a \nnew trial\u201d).  This rule is consistent with centuries of \nhistorical \npractice. \n \nSee, \ne.g., \nJoseph \nStory, \nCommentaries on Equity Pleadings 322 (2d ed. 1840) \n(explaining that a final judgment can be reopened \nbased only on \u201csome new matter, which hath arisen in \ntime after the decree, and not on any new proof, which \nmight have been used, when the decree was made\u201d \n(discussing the Ordinances in Chancery of Lord \nChancellor Bacon)); Purcell v. Miner, 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) \n519, 521 (1867) (same).  But, under the Second \nCircuit\u2019s regime, movants can introduce new factual \nallegations through Rule 60(b)(6), even if they could \nhave presented them before, and even if more than a \nyear has elapsed from the entry of final judgment.  See \nMandala, 88 F.4th at 365.  In this way, too, the Second \n\n34 \n \nCircuit has put Rule 60 \u201cat war with itself.\u201d  United \nStates ex rel. Polansky v. Exec. Health Res., Inc., 599 \nU.S. 419, 434 (2023) (citation omitted).  \n3. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s Test Distorts this \nCourt\u2019s Precedents. \nLeft with no support in Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s text or \ncontext, the Second Circuit tried to ground its \nstandard in Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178.  See \nMandala, 88 F.4th at 362; Pet.App.6.  But Foman did \nnot address a Rule 60(b)(6) motion.  This Court instead \nrecognized the motion there (which was filed just a day \nafter the district court\u2019s decision) \u201cas one under Rule \n59(e).\u201d  Foman, 371 U.S. at 179, 181 (emphasis added). \nAs a result, Foman is simply inapt in this setting. \nRather, the controlling precedent is Gonzalez, which \nreaffirmed that a Rule 60(b)(6) motion \u201crequires a \nshowing of \u2018extraordinary circumstances.\u2019\u201d  545 U.S. at \n536.  And there is no basis to conflate that demanding \nstandard with the one for Rule 59(e).  \u201cThe difference \nbetween the two rules . . . is material, both in scope \nand purpose, and, by their own terms, different \nstandards apply.\u201d  Daulatzai, 97 F.4th at 177. \nIndeed, \u201cRule 60(b) differs from Rule 59(e) in just \nabout every way that matters to the inquiry here.\u201d  \nBanister, 590 U.S. at 518; see Daulatzai, 97 F.4th at \n177-78.  A Rule 59(e) motion \u201cis a one-time effort to \nbring alleged errors in a just-issued decision to a \n[district] court\u2019s attention, before taking a single \nappeal.\u201d  Banister, 590 U.S. at 521; see Fed. R. Civ. P. \n59(e).  Accordingly, the time for bringing a Rule 59(e) \nmotion \u201cis short\u201428 days from entry of the judgment, \nwith no possibility of an extension.\u201d  Banister, 590 U.S. \nat 507-08.  And, because \u201c[i]t is a limited continuation \n\n35 \n \nof the original proceeding,\u201d a timely Rule 59(e) motion \nautomatically \n\u201c\u2018suspend[s] \nthe \nfinality\u2019 \nof \nany \njudgment.\u201d  Id. at 514, 521 (citation omitted); see Fed. \nR. App. P. 4(a)(4)(A)(iv).  \u201cOnly the disposition of that \nmotion restores the finality of the original judgment,\u201d \nand \nthat \ndisposition \n\u201cmerges \nwith \nthe \nprior \ndetermination, so that the reviewing court takes up \nonly one judgment\u201d on appeal.  Banister, 590 U.S. at \n508-09 (brackets and quotation marks omitted).  By \ncontrast, \u201c[a] Rule 60(b) motion\u2014often distant in time \nand scope and always giving rise to a separate \nappeal\u2014attacks an already completed judgment,\u201d and \nit \u201c\u2018does not affect the [original] judgment\u2019s finality or \nsuspend its operation.\u201d  Id. at 520-21 (second \nalteration in original) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(c)(2)).  \nA Rule 60(b) motion therefore uniquely \u201cthreaten[s] an \nalready final judgment with successive litigation.\u201d  Id. \nat 519.  Consequently, the \u201cstandard for granting a \nRule 59(e) motion\u201d is more \u201cbroad and open ended\u201d \nthan Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s strict standard for relief.  \nDaulatzai, 97 F.4th at 177.   \nThe Second Circuit failed to grasp these crucial \ndifferences.  Instead, Mandala and the decision below \nwrongly treated Rule 59(e) and Rule 60(b)(6) motions \nas fungible, and then uncritically transplanted \nFoman\u2019s more forgiving Rule 59(e) standard to \noverride the stringent requirements for Rule 60(b)(6).  \nThis Court should reject that misguided approach.  It \ndisregards Rule 60(b)\u2019s unique text and context and \nflouts this Court\u2019s Rule 60(b) precedents. \n\n36 \n \n4. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s Test Undermines \nthe Guiding Principles of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure. \nEven if there were any doubt (which there is not), \nthe Federal Rules would require this Court to resolve \nit against the Second Circuit\u2019s interpretation.  That is \nbecause the Rules state that they must be \u201cconstrued\u201d \nin the face of ambiguity to \u201csecure the just, speedy, and \ninexpensive determination of every action and \nproceeding.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 1.   \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s approach flips those guiding \nprinciples on their head.  It eschews finality, and it \nundermines confidence in the outcome of hard-fought \nlitigation.  It also enables plaintiffs to \u201cuse the court \nas a sounding board to discover holes in their \narguments, then \u2018reopen the case by amending their \ncomplaint to take account of the court\u2019s decision,\u2019\u201d even \nafter testing the complaint against a full appeal and \nrepeatedly declining earlier opportunities to amend.  \nLeisure Caviar, 616 F.3d at 616 (quoting James v. \nWatt, 716 F.2d 71, 78 (1st Cir. 1983) (Breyer, J.)).  Such \ngamesmanship will inevitably draw out litigation and \ndrive up its already high costs.   \nThis case proves the point.  The matter \u201chas been \nclosed since January 15, 2020,\u201d when Petitioner \nsecured a final judgment in its favor.  Pet.App.10.  \nPetitioner prevailed on appeal after that.  Then \nPetitioner successfully showed that Rule 60(b) \nprovided no path for reopening the final judgment.  \nRespondents\u2019 \u201cfail[ure] to satisfy the requirements of \nRule 60(b) should therefore have ended the matter.\u201d  \nDaulatzai, 97 F.4th at 179.  Yet, Respondents continue \nto seek a return to square one\u2014merely so that they \n\n37 \n \ncan plead new factual allegations that were previously \navailable to them and which they had expressly \ndeclined to plead before dismissal. \nAllowing losing litigants to thus restart the loop of \nlitigation would not promote the \u201cspeedy\u201d and \n\u201cinexpensive\u201d resolution of claims.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 1.  \nNor would it be \u201cjust.\u201d  Id.  Quite the opposite:  Like \nthe doctrine of res judicata, Rule 60(b)\u2019s demanding \nrequirements for reopening a final judgment are \nthemselves rooted in \u201cfundamental and substantial \njustice,\u201d and they are designed to further both \u201c\u2018public \npolicy and . . . private peace.\u2019\u201d  Federated Dep\u2019t Stores, \nInc. v. Moitie, 452 U.S. 394, 401 (1981) (citation \nomitted); see supra Section I.A.  They should therefore \n\u201cbe cordially regarded and enforced by the courts.\u201d  \nMoitie, 452 U.S. at 401 (citation omitted).  The \n\u201cweighty interests in finality\u201d must \u201ctrump the \ninterest in giving losing litigants access to an \nadditional\u201d round of proceedings in all but the most \nunusual case.  See San Remo Hotel, L.P. v. City & \nCounty of S.F., 545 U.S. 323, 345 (2005).  That is \nparticularly true when the movant seeks a mulligan to \nrescue himself from his \u201cfree, calculated, deliberate \nchoices.\u201d  Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 198.   \nConsistent with these fundamental tenets of civil \nprocedure, courts have long rejected belated attempts \nby plaintiffs to attack a final judgment with an \namended complaint.  See supra note 3 (collecting \ncases).  They have instead required plaintiffs to put \ntheir best foot forward before judgment or risk an end \nto their lawsuit.  And they have reserved Rule 60(b)(6) \nrelief\u2014as this Court\u2019s precedents command\u2014for only \n\n38 \n \ntruly \u201ccompelling circumstances\u201d outside the movant\u2019s \ncontrol.  James, 716 F.2d at 78 (Breyer, J.). \n*   *   * \nIn sum, Rule 15(a) \u201cgoverns amendment of \npleadings before judgment is entered; it has no \napplication after judgment is entered.\u201d  Jacobs v. \nTempur-Pedic Int\u2019l Inc., 626 F.3d 1327, 1344 (11th Cir. \n2010).  From that point, a party that seeks \u201crelief from \na final judgment\u201d must first satisfy the rigorous \ndemands of Rule 60(b).  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) \n(capitalization altered).5  And where, as here, the \nparty seeks such relief under Rule 60(b)(6), he must \n\u201cshow \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019\u201d beyond his \ncontrol that would \u201cjustify[] the reopening of a final \njudgment.\u201d  Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 535 (quoting \nAckermann, 340 U.S. at 199); see Pioneer Inv. Servs., \n507 U.S. at 393.  Only after surmounting that \nintentionally high hurdle for vacating the judgment \ncan he invoke the more liberal policies of Rule 15(a).  \nThe Second Circuit erred in holding to the contrary. \nII. Respondents Cannot Satisfy Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s \nStringent Standard. \nThis Court should reverse the decision below and \nbring an end to this litigation once and for all.  Unlike \nthe Second Circuit, the District Court applied the \ncorrect legal standard by refusing to \u201c\u2018entertain a \nmotion to amend the complaint\u2019 under Rule 15(a) \nwithout \u2018a valid basis to vacate the previously entered \njudgment\u2019 under Rule 60(b).\u201d  Pet.App.7 (quoting \nDistrict Court\u2019s decision).  It properly treated those \n \n5  Or those of Rule 59(e), if the motion is filed within 28 days \nof the entry of judgment. \n\n39 \n \nRules as posing two distinct inquiries.  And, in a \nthoughtful \nopinion \nissued \nafter \na \npre-motion \nconference and full briefing, it methodically explained \nwhy Respondents \u201chave not demonstrated any \nextraordinary circumstances warranting relief under \nRule 60(b)(6).\u201d  Pet.App.14. \nA. Respondents Have Not Demonstrated \n\u201cExtraordinary Circumstances.\u201d \nWhen a District Court applies the correct legal \nstandard, as here, \u201cRule 60(b) proceedings are subject \nto only limited and deferential appellate review.\u201d  \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. at 535.  An appellate court \u201cmay \nreview the [district court\u2019s] ruling only for abuse of \ndiscretion.\u201d  Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corrs. of Ill., 434 \nU.S. 257, 263 n.7 (1978).  And that standard affords \u201ca \nwide range of choice\u201d to the district court.  McLane Co. \nv. EEOC, 581 U.S. 72, 83 (2017) (citation omitted).  \nAppellate courts cannot \u201cinterfere with the District \nCourt\u2019s exercise of discretion unless\u201d they are left with \n\u201ca definite and firm conviction that the court \ncommitted a clear error of judgment.\u201d  Betterbox \nCommc\u2019ns, Ltd. v. BB Techs, Inc., 300 F.3d 325, 332 \n(3d Cir. 2002) (Alito, J.) (alterations adopted; citation \nomitted).  In other words, the Court must \u201cfind a \ncomplete absence of a reasonable basis and [be] \ncertain that the [District Court\u2019s] decision is wrong.\u201d  \nDavis v. Kan. Dep\u2019t of Corrs., 507 F.3d 1246, 1248 (10th \nCir. 2007) (citation omitted). \nThat is not the case here.  Far from it.  Respondents \nhave never contended \u201cthat any of their proposed new \nallegations were unavailable to them\u201d when they filed \ntheir complaint or when they repeatedly declined the \nDistrict Court\u2019s invitations to amend.  Pet.App.15.  \n\n40 \n \nThey argue only that the Second Circuit \u201cclarified\u201d the \nJASTA pleading standard in some respects in their \nprevious appeal of the District Court\u2019s dismissal.  \nBIO.2.  But that is neither correct nor relevant.   \nIt is not correct because the Second Circuit \naffirmed the dismissal on grounds that the District \nCourt had relied on\u2014namely, that Respondents\u2019 \n\u201callegations do not support an inference that BLOM \nBank was aware of the Three Customers\u2019 ties with \nHamas prior to the relevant attacks.\u201d  Pet.App.49; see \nalso Pet.App.74-75 (\u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 allegations therefore \nfail to raise above the speculative level the specter that \nBLOM was aware of a connection between the Three \nCustomers and Hamas at the time it provided \nfinancial services to the Three Customers.\u201d).  In dicta, \nthe Second Circuit disagreed with other grounds relied \non by the District Court.  But the District Court\u2019s \nindependent conclusion that Respondents failed to \ndemonstrate general awareness at the time of the \nalleged assistance\u2014as JASTA requires\u2014\u201cremain[s] \ncompletely unaffected by anything that was decided or \nsaid\u201d by the Second Circuit in this case or any other.  \nPolites v. United States, 364 U.S. 426, 436 (1960) \n(affirming denial of Rule 60(b) motion).   \nRespondents\u2019 argument is also irrelevant because, \neven if the Second Circuit had clarified its view of the \nlaw, that would not be enough to satisfy Rule 60(b)(6).  \n\u201cIntervening developments in the law by themselves \nrarely\u201d \nif \never \n\u201cconstitute \nthe \nextraordinary \ncircumstances required for relief under Rule 60(b)(6).\u201d  \nAgostini, 521 U.S. at 239; see Pet.App.14-15.  And the \ndevelopments here are by no means groundbreaking.  \nThe governing statute did not change after final \n\n41 \n \njudgment. \n \nRespondents \nmerely \nallege \na \n\u201cclarification[]\u201d of the law by the Second Circuit that \nwas in line with their own interpretation.  BIO.25.  \nThere \nis \nnothing \n\u201cextraordinary\u201d \nabout \nthat.  \nRespondents never \u201cexplain[ed] why they did not \nallege facts sufficient to satisfy the standard for which \nthey were advocating.\u201d  Pet.App.17 n.5.  And clarifying \nthe law is what appellate courts do all the time.  In \nfact, this Court has held that even a \u201cchange in the \nlaw\u201d worked by one of its decisions abrogating \npreviously controlling circuit precedent could not \njustify Rule 60(b)(6) relief.  Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 536-\n37 (emphasis added).  Such a change in decisional \ncaselaw, \nthe \nCourt \nexplained, \nis \n\u201chardly \nextraordinary.\u201d  Id. at 536.  The circumstances here \nare even less so.  \nIn short, the District Court\u2019s determination that \nRespondents failed to satisfy Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s high bar \nfor reopening a final judgment fell well within the \nrange of permissible decisions.  It was not an abuse of \ndiscretion.  It should have been upheld for that reason \nalone. \nB. Respondents Waived or Forfeited Multiple \nOpportunities to Amend Their Complaint. \nNot only did the District Court act within its \ndiscretion, but it would have abused its discretion had \nit ruled the other way.  As this Court has explained, it \nis \u201can abuse of discretion\u201d to \u201coverride a [party\u2019s] \ndeliberative waiver.\u201d  Wood, 566 U.S. at 472-73 \n(citation omitted).  And this case involves waiver many \ntimes over.  Respondents \u201cdo not contend that the \nadditional facts they now propose to allege were not \navailable\u201d to them before, and they \u201cconcede that they \n\n42 \n \ntwice declined the opportunity to amend their \nComplaint before th[e] [District] Court dismissed it.\u201d  \nPet.App.16, 18 n.6.  The District Court rightly held \nthat those repeated waivers foreclosed relief as well.  \nSee Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 198.   \nRespondents first rejected the District Court\u2019s \ninvitation to amend at the pre-motion conference.  \nPet.App.16-17.  Before that conference, Petitioner \nexplained that \u201cthe Complaint alleges nothing more \nthan that [Petitioner] provided routine banking \nservices to organizations that later were revealed to be \nconnected to Hamas.\u201d  JA.145.  \u201c[N]one of the \nallegations, if true, would establish that [Petitioner] \nwas aware of that connection at the time it provided \nthose banking services\u201d to the Three Customers.  Id.  \nAccordingly, the District Court asked Respondents\u2019 \ncounsel if there were \u201cany additional facts [they] could \nadd to the allegations\u201d to address Petitioner\u2019s \narguments.  Pet.App.93.  Respondents\u2019 counsel \n\u201cexpressly declined\u201d the invitation.  Pet.App.17.  The \nDistrict Court then asked a second time if \nRespondents \u201cwould not want to amend\u201d if the Court \n\u201cwere to grant [Petitioner\u2019s] motion.\u201d  Pet.App.93.  \nRespondents unequivocally stated that they \u201cwould \nnot seek leave to amend.\u201d  Pet.App.94.  Hence, the \nDistrict Court issued a minute entry and scheduling \norder to that effect.  JA.156. \nNotwithstanding that entry, the District Court \ngave Respondents yet another chance to amend at oral \nargument \non \nPetitioner\u2019s \nmotion \nto \ndismiss.  \nPet.App.17-18.  At the hearing, the judge explained \nthat she \u201cjust [did not] see any knowledge on the part \nof [Petitioner]\u201d alleged in the complaint.  Pet.App.118.  \n\n43 \n \nShe asked if \u201ceverything [she] need[ed] to consider in \nterms of sufficiency of [the] pleading is going to be \nfound in the complaint that\u2019s filed in this case.\u201d  \nPet.App.124.  And she asked Respondents to confirm \nthat \u201c[t]here are no facts that [Respondents] would \nhave to offer to address some of the contentions of \n[Petitioner] \nregarding \nknowledge, \nespecially.\u201d  \nPet.App.125.  In response, Respondents \u201cagain \nexpressly declined the opportunity to amend their \ncomplaint\u201d and chose to proceed on their complaint as \npled.  Pet.App.18.  That was a \u201ccalculated and \ndeliberate\u201d choice.  Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 198.  Rule \n60(b)(6) therefore \u201chas no application.\u201d  Id. at 202. \nNor did Respondents\u2019 waivers stop there.  Despite \nproceeding up to the Second Circuit, Respondents \n\u201cnever appealed the \u2018with prejudice\u2019 aspect of the \ndismissal\u201d and never argued that the District Court \nshould \nhave \ngranted \nthem \nleave \nto \nreplead.  \nPet.App.16 n.4.  They simply maintained that their \nallegations were sufficient.  The District Court \ncorrectly recognized this litigation choice as still \nanother waiver that precluded Respondents from \nseeking leave to replead if they lost on appeal.  See id. \n(citing 18A Wright & Miller, Federal Practice & \nProcedure \u00a7 4433 (3d ed. 2021) (\u201cA party who elects to \nappeal on one issue, omitting another issue on which \nit lost, is subject to issue preclusion on the issue not \nappealed.\u201d)).   \nThat failure was by itself fatal, even ignoring \nRespondents\u2019 previous waivers.  If a party\u2019s \u201creason \nasserted for [its] Rule 60(b)(6) motion could have been \naddressed on appeal from the judgment,\u201d then the \nmotion must be denied \u201cas merely an inappropriate \n\n44 \n \nsubstitute for an appeal.\u201d  Aikens v. Ingram, 652 F.3d \n496, 501 (4th Cir. 2011) (en banc).  This understanding \nthat Rule 60(b)(6) \u201ccannot be used as a substitute for \nappeal\u201d has been \u201csettled\u201d for decades.  Jean F. \nRydstrom, Construction and Application of Rule \n60(b)(6) of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 15 A.L.R. \nFed. 193, \u00a7 2[a] (2024).  And that principle makes \neminent sense.  Otherwise, parties could skirt the \nlimitations period for post-judgment motions based on \n\u201cmistake, \ninadvertence, \nsurprise, \nor \nexcusable \nneglect,\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1), as well as the \njurisdictional time limits for appealing an adverse \ndecision, see Fed. R. App. P. 4(a); Bowles v. Russell, 551 \nU.S. 205, 206 (2007). \nEach of the foregoing waivers demonstrates that \nRespondents were not \u201cfaultless in the delay.\u201d  Pioneer \nInv. Servs., 507 U.S. at 393.  That delay resulted from \ntheir own strategic decisions, each of which precludes \nrelief.  And, beyond those waivers, Respondents \nforfeited still more opportunities to seek amendment \nof their complaint.  In particular, before failing to \nappeal from the District Court\u2019s \u201cwith prejudice\u201d \nruling, they failed to file a Rule 59(e) motion \nchallenging that aspect of the District Court\u2019s \ndismissal.  And despite being invited to file \nsupplemental briefing in the Second Circuit\u2014after \nthat court issued its controlling decision in Kaplan\u2014\nRespondents still failed to request leave to amend in \nlight of that new precedent.   \nRespondents have thus come nowhere close to \nmeeting Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d \nstandard.  Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 536.  In fact, they \ncould not even satisfy Foman\u2019s more lenient standard \n\n45 \n \nfor Rule 59(e) motions.  Foman held only that a district \ncourt \nerrs \nby \n\u201coutright \nrefus[ing]\u201d \nto \npermit \namendment before appeal \u201cwithout any justifying \nreason.\u201d  371 U.S. at 182.  Here, by contrast, the \nDistrict Court provided many justifying reasons for \ndenying relief (after appellate proceedings had \nalready concluded).  It explained that Respondents \n\u201chad ample opportunity to pursue all legal avenues \navailable to them for relief,\u201d but they simply chose not \nto do so.  Pet.App.16.  They instead engaged in a \n\u201cdocumented series of deliberate choices not to cure \nthe deficiencies identified in their pleading by \n[Petitioner] and [the District] Court.\u201d  Pet.App.19.  \nThose \u201cfree, calculated, deliberate choices are not to be \nrelieved from.\u201d  Id. (quoting Ackermann, 340 U.S. at \n198).  Not only was the District Court\u2019s decision a \npermissible exercise of discretion, but it was \ndemonstrably correct. \n \n \n\n46 \n \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should reverse \nthe judgment below. \n  \n \n \n \n  Respectfully submitted, \nJONATHAN R.

Circuit courts generally hold that \nmeans providing an opportunity to amend once a ruling \nidentifies remediable defects, if any, in a pleading. Fail-\ning to provide that opportunity may constitute an \u201cex-\ntraordinary circumstance\u201d and a basis to vacate a judg-\nment under Rule 60(b)(6).  \nHere, the Second Circuit found that the district \ncourt dismissed Respondents\u2019 complaint by applying \nthe \u201cwrong legal standard\u201d for pleading an aiding and \nabetting claim (in the Second Circuit) under the Justice \nAgainst Sponsors of Terrorism Act, as well as a stand-\nard for pleading knowledge that was \u201ctoo exacting\u201d and \nall but impossible to meet by amendment. The circuit \ncourt provided clarified pleading standards and identi-\nfied specific, remediable defects in the complaint. Re-\nspondents then promptly moved to vacate the district \ncourt\u2019s judgment in order to meet those clarified stand-\nards in an amended complaint\u2014their first in this litiga-\ntion. The district court refused and, after Respondents \nappealed again, the circuit issued a non-precedential \nsummary order remanding the case for \u201crecon-\nsider[ation].\u201d \nThe question presented is thus whether the circuit \ncourt erred in directing the district court to reconsider \nits refusal to grant Respondents an opportunity to meet \nthe pleading standards the circuit corrected in the prior \nappeal. \n \n \n\nii \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \nQUESTION PRESENTED ............................................. i \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES ......................................... iv \nINTRODUCTION .......................................................... 1 \nSTATEMENT ................................................................ 4 \nI. \nThe Complaint and Pre-Motion Conference for \nBLOM\u2019s Motion to Dismiss .............................. 4 \nII. \nThe Motion to Dismiss ..................................... 7 \nIII.

The dis-\ntrict court had denied vacatur because Plaintiffs de-\nclined its pre-dismissal invitations to amend their \ncomplaint\u2014but the circuit court found the district \ncourt was applying the \u201cwrong\u201d pleading standards, \nPet.App.5, which were so overly \u201cexacting\u201d that Plain-\ntiffs could not meet them before discovery, Pet.App.49.  \nPetitioner (\u201cBLOM\u201d) argues that by making this \nstraightforward remand, the Second Circuit has effec-\ntively \u201cabandon[ed] the \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 \nstandard in favor of a nebulous \u2018balanc[ing]\u2019 inquiry \nthat pits Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s protection of \u2018finality\u2019 against \n\u2018Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policies.\u2019\u201d Pet.Br.25 \n(quoting Pet.App.8). In BLOM\u2019s telling, the Second \nCircuit has \u201cjettisoned\u201d Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s guardrails, \nPet.Br.14., and motions for post-judgment amend-\nments will now be all but rubber-stamped in the cir-\ncuit. This is incorrect. \nFirst of all, this conclusion is not supported by the \nspare language of the summary order, which simply \ndirects the district court to \u201creconsider\u201d denying vaca-\ntur given Second Circuit and Supreme Court prece-\ndents. Nothing has been \u201cabandoned\u201d\u2014consistent \nwith decisions from this Court, \u201c[r]elief under Rule \n60(b)(6)\u201d in the Second Circuit \u201cis reserved for cases \nthat present \u2018extraordinary circumstances,\u2019\u201d including \nwhere a party seeks post-judgment amendment. Man-\ndala v. NTT Data, Inc., 88 F.4th 353, 361 (2d Cir. 2023) \n(citation omitted). Indeed, the standards the Second \n\n \n \n \n \n \n2 \n \nCircuit has \u201cdeveloped\u201d\u2014and reaffirmed by the sum-\nmary order below\u2014\u201cfor evaluating postjudgment mo-\ntions generally place significant emphasis on the \n\u2018value of finality and repose.\u2019\u201d Williams v. Citigroup \nInc., 659 F.3d 208, 213 (2d Cir. 2011) (citation omit-\nted). \nSecond, balancing finality and justice is not \u201cnebu-\nlous,\u201d as BLOM calls it, but rather inherent to Rule \n60(b)(6) jurisprudence: The rule\u2019s \u201cextraordinary cir-\ncumstances\u201d requirement \u201cexists in order to balance \nthe broad language of Rule 60(b)(6), which allows \ncourts to set aside judgments for \u2018any\u2019 reason justify-\ning relief, with the interest in the finality of judg-\nments.\u201d Budget Blinds, Inc. v. White, 536 F.3d 244, \n255 (3d Cir. 2008). When considering a motion to \namend a complaint, finality interests are \u201cbalance[d] \n. . . with the preference expressed in the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure in general, and Rule 15 in particu-\nlar, for resolving disputes on their merits.\u201d Krupski v. \nCosta Crociere S. p. A., 560 U.S. 538, 550 (2010).  \nThird, this case does involve truly \u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d because (1) the district court dismissed \nthe complaint using a set of \u201cwrong legal standards,\u201d \nincluding the nearly impossible requirement of alleg-\ning, without the opportunity for any discovery, \u201cacts or \nstatements\u201d of \u201cBLOM employees\u201d to demonstrate the \nbank\u2019s knowledge; (2) the circuit court rejected those \nstandards on appeal\u2014including the direct evidence re-\nquirement\u2014and \u201cclarified\u201d the correct ones; (3) the cir-\ncuit court found that Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations were none-\ntheless too \u201climited\u201d to meet the clarified standards, \ndrawing a newly announced distinction between \nPlaintiffs\u2019 \u201cpublicly available\u201d evidence and \u201cpublic \nsources such as media articles,\u201d Pet.App.50 & n.18; (4) \nthe circuit court identified several remediable defects \n\n \n \n \n \n \n3 \n \nin the complaint that the district court had not, such \nas clarifying that cash withdrawals are untraceable \nand alleging the degree to which Israeli terrorism des-\nignations were publicized; and (5) Plaintiffs had not \nyet amended their complaint even once. In these one-\nof-a-kind circumstances, the Rules\u2019 strong preference \nfor deciding cases on their merits entitles Plaintiffs to \nhave at least one opportunity to cure those defects. \nBLOM\u2019s argument is therefore premised on con-\nstruing the case\u2019s procedural history to suggest the \nSecond Circuit found that Plaintiffs \u201cwaived\u201d their \nright to amend post-judgment but nevertheless \u201cdi-\nrected district courts to override and rescue parties \nfrom their \u2018free, calculated, [and] deliberate choices,\u2019\u201d \nsuch as \u201cwhen the movant has consistently and con-\nsciously rejected numerous invitations and opportuni-\nties to amend.\u201d Pet.Br.28-29 (citations omitted).  \nBut the Second Circuit never accepted BLOM\u2019s \n\u201cwaiver\u201d argument. To the contrary, it recognized that \nPlaintiffs did not have a meaningful opportunity to \namend at all because \u201cthe district court applied the \nwrong legal standard for aiding-and-abetting liability \nunder JASTA,\u201d Pet.App.5, and a standard for pleading \nknowledge that was \u201ctoo exacting,\u201d Pet.App.49. In fact, \nthe district court\u2019s knowledge pleading standard was \nunmeetable\u2014as Circuit Court Judge Wesley noted in \nresponse to BLOM\u2019s insistence at oral argument that \nPlaintiffs waived opportunities to amend: \u201cWhat are \nthey supposed to do? They know they can\u2019t amend [to] \n. . . meet that.\u201d Oral Arg. at 11:52-:56, Honickman, No. \n22-1039 (2d Cir. Oct. 5, 2023), https://ww3.ca2. \nuscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/6a33dfa3-27c7-4b0a-\n82ee-86c41553c09a/1/doc/22-1039.mp3. \nIgnoring this, BLOM further insists that \u201cthe Sec-\nond Circuit affirmed the dismissal on grounds that the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n4 \n \nDistrict Court had relied on,\u201d Pet.Br. 40\u2014but the dis-\ntrict court itself acknowledged that the decision was \naffirmed \u201con other grounds.\u201d Pet.App.10. Most im-\nportantly, BLOM\u2019s reading of the record is irrelevant \nto the question presented\u2014the summary order below \nwas not premised on any such finding and thus did not \ndirect district courts to \u201coverride\u201d waivers.  \nThe unusual procedural history of this case makes \nclear that no meaningful opportunities to satisfy the \ncorrect legal standards were available to Plaintiffs and \ntherefore the remand to the district court was not a \ndeparture from Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s long-recognized stand-\nards. Rather, in the Second Circuit parties who de-\nclined meaningful invitations \u201care not entitled to relief \nfrom the judgment.\u201d Metzler Inv. GmbH v. Chipotle \nMexican Grill, Inc., 970 F.3d 133, 148 (2d Cir. 2020).  \nThis is not unusual\u2014the circuits broadly require \ndistrict courts to provide at least one opportunity to \namend, often after dismissal when the complaint\u2019s re-\nmediable defects, if any, are correctly identified by a \ncourt ruling. Refusing leave to amend after dismissal \nis thus often an abuse of discretion\u2014the result is no \ndifferent here, except that Plaintiffs were compelled to \nappeal the district court\u2019s erroneous decision first. \nSTATEMENT \nI. \nThe Complaint and Pre-Motion Conference \nfor BLOM\u2019s Motion to Dismiss \nPlaintiffs filed their complaint on January 1, 2019, \nasserting claims under the Anti-Terrorism Act \n(\u201cATA\u201d), as amended by the Justice Against Sponsors \nof Terrorism Act (\u201cJASTA\u201d), and alleging that BLOM \naided and abetted a series of terrorist attacks commit-\nted by the Palestinian foreign terrorist organization \n(\u201cFTO\u201d) Hamas (or \u201cHAMAS\u201d) that injured Plaintiffs. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n5 \n \nSpecifically, Plaintiffs alleged that BLOM knowingly \nprovided substantial assistance to three Hamas fund-\nraisers (the \u201cThree Customers\u201d), including the pur-\nported charitable institution Sanabil, which the \nUnited States designated a Specially Designated \nGlobal Terrorist (\u201cSDGT\u201d) in 2003. Relying in part on \nfinancial records disclosed during the criminal trial of \nthe Holy Land Foundation (\u201cHLF,\u201d a notorious Hamas \nfundraiser) in Texas, Plaintiffs alleged that BLOM as-\nsisted the Three Customers in converting millions of \ndollars of donations from HLF and other Hamas sup-\nporters abroad into cash (notwithstanding BLOM\u2019s de-\nscription of its services as \u201croutine,\u201d Pet.Br.5-6), which \nthey used, inter alia, to recruit Palestinians living in \nLebanon to join and support Hamas before and during \nthe \u201cSecond Intifada,\u201d when the acts of terrorism at is-\nsue here occurred.  \nPlaintiffs alleged BLOM\u2019s knowledge by \u201crefer-\nences to media articles and publications on the Three \nCustomers\u2019 connection to Hamas.\u201d Pet.App.49. Plain-\ntiffs also alleged that Sanabil\u2019s board included contem-\nporaneous Hamas leaders in Lebanon. JA.105, 114. \nPlaintiffs alleged that Israel designated another one of \nthe Three Customers, the Union of Good, as \u201cpart of \nthe Hamas organization\u201d in 2002, during the relevant \nperiod (1998-2004, JA.82). JA.118. The Union of \nGood\u2019s infamous leader, Sheikh Qaradawi, regularly \nappeared on television during that period extolling the \nvirtues of suicide bombings against Israel. JA.120.  \nPlaintiffs also alleged that BLOM converted mil-\nlions of dollars for the Three Customers from not only \nHLF, but also from its successor KindHearts after the \nUnited States designated HLF an SDGT in 2001, \nJA.99-100, 106-13, 117, and from Al Aqsa Foundation \nafter Israel designated it a Hamas entity and its \n\n \n \n \n \n \n6 \n \nheadquarters were shuttered by the German govern-\nment\u2014and one transaction after the United States \ndesignated it an SDGT. JA.95-96, 113.  \nOn May 3, 2019, BLOM filed a letter requesting a \npre-motion conference to initiate a motion to dismiss \nthe complaint for failure to state a claim, setting forth \na summary of its anticipated arguments. JA.142-47. \nThese arguments, which the district court later \nadopted in dismissing the complaint, were incon-\nsistent with JASTA\u2019s plain language, the interpreta-\ntive guidance in Halberstam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472 \n(D.C. Cir. 1983)\u2014which Congress set as the legal \nframework for JASTA\u2014and the Second Circuit\u2019s then-\nonly prior JASTA ruling in Linde v. Arab Bank, PLC, \n882 F.3d 314 (2d Cir. 2018).  \nPlaintiffs provided a summary of their anticipated \nopposition in a letter on May 8, 2019. JA.148-55. Spe-\ncifically, Plaintiffs relied on the standards from both \nLinde and Halberstam and noted that foreseeability \nwas the key factor in assessing a defendant\u2019s wrongful \nconduct under JASTA. As shown below, the district \ncourt ultimately adopted BLOM\u2019s arguments and re-\njected foreseeability. See Pet.App.71-72. The Second \nCircuit subsequently vindicated Plaintiffs\u2019 analysis, as \ndid this Court four years later. See Twitter, Inc. v. \nTaamneh, 598 U.S. 471, 496 (2023).  \nThe district court held a pre-motion conference on \nMay 15, 2019. After raising sua sponte whether BLOM \nhad an affirmative defense based on the statute of lim-\nitations, Pet.App.91, the court then stated:  \nI am just wondering if it might be prudent to \nallow the plaintiffs to amend their complaint, \nnot to add more claims, not to add more parties, \nbut rather to factually support some of the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n7 \n \nclaims that [defense counsel] have identified as \nbeing deficient regarding the standards that \nwere adopted by [Linde] from [Halberstam]. \n[Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel], do you want that oppor-\ntunity?  \nPet.App.93. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel responded, \u201cNo, I think \nwe are prepared to brief it based on the arguments pre-\nsented in [our] pre-motion letter.\u201d Id.

Circuit courts generally hold that \nmeans providing an opportunity to amend once a ruling \nidentifies remediable defects, if any, in a pleading. Fail-\ning to provide that opportunity may constitute an \u201cex-\ntraordinary circumstance\u201d and a basis to vacate a judg-\nment under Rule 60(b)(6).  \nHere, the Second Circuit found that the district \ncourt dismissed Respondents\u2019 complaint by applying \nthe \u201cwrong legal standard\u201d for pleading an aiding and \nabetting claim (in the Second Circuit) under the Justice \nAgainst Sponsors of Terrorism Act, as well as a stand-\nard for pleading knowledge that was \u201ctoo exacting\u201d and \nall but impossible to meet by amendment. The circuit \ncourt provided clarified pleading standards and identi-\nfied specific, remediable defects in the complaint. Re-\nspondents then promptly moved to vacate the district \ncourt\u2019s judgment in order to meet those clarified stand-\nards in an amended complaint\u2014their first in this litiga-\ntion. The district court refused and, after Respondents \nappealed again, the circuit issued a non-precedential \nsummary order remanding the case for \u201crecon-\nsider[ation].\u201d \nThe question presented is thus whether the circuit \ncourt erred in directing the district court to reconsider \nits refusal to grant Respondents an opportunity to meet \nthe pleading standards the circuit corrected in the prior \nappeal. \n \n \n\nii \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \nQUESTION PRESENTED ............................................. i \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES ......................................... iv \nINTRODUCTION .......................................................... 1 \nSTATEMENT ................................................................ 4 \nI. \nThe Complaint and Pre-Motion Conference for \nBLOM\u2019s Motion to Dismiss .............................. 4 \nII. \nThe Motion to Dismiss ..................................... 7 \nIII.

The dis-\ntrict court had denied vacatur because Plaintiffs de-\nclined its pre-dismissal invitations to amend their \ncomplaint\u2014but the circuit court found the district \ncourt was applying the \u201cwrong\u201d pleading standards, \nPet.App.5, which were so overly \u201cexacting\u201d that Plain-\ntiffs could not meet them before discovery, Pet.App.49.  \nPetitioner (\u201cBLOM\u201d) argues that by making this \nstraightforward remand, the Second Circuit has effec-\ntively \u201cabandon[ed] the \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 \nstandard in favor of a nebulous \u2018balanc[ing]\u2019 inquiry \nthat pits Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s protection of \u2018finality\u2019 against \n\u2018Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policies.\u2019\u201d Pet.Br.25 \n(quoting Pet.App.8). In BLOM\u2019s telling, the Second \nCircuit has \u201cjettisoned\u201d Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s guardrails, \nPet.Br.14., and motions for post-judgment amend-\nments will now be all but rubber-stamped in the cir-\ncuit. This is incorrect. \nFirst of all, this conclusion is not supported by the \nspare language of the summary order, which simply \ndirects the district court to \u201creconsider\u201d denying vaca-\ntur given Second Circuit and Supreme Court prece-\ndents. Nothing has been \u201cabandoned\u201d\u2014consistent \nwith decisions from this Court, \u201c[r]elief under Rule \n60(b)(6)\u201d in the Second Circuit \u201cis reserved for cases \nthat present \u2018extraordinary circumstances,\u2019\u201d including \nwhere a party seeks post-judgment amendment. Man-\ndala v. NTT Data, Inc., 88 F.4th 353, 361 (2d Cir. 2023) \n(citation omitted). Indeed, the standards the Second \n\n \n \n \n \n \n2 \n \nCircuit has \u201cdeveloped\u201d\u2014and reaffirmed by the sum-\nmary order below\u2014\u201cfor evaluating postjudgment mo-\ntions generally place significant emphasis on the \n\u2018value of finality and repose.\u2019\u201d Williams v. Citigroup \nInc., 659 F.3d 208, 213 (2d Cir. 2011) (citation omit-\nted). \nSecond, balancing finality and justice is not \u201cnebu-\nlous,\u201d as BLOM calls it, but rather inherent to Rule \n60(b)(6) jurisprudence: The rule\u2019s \u201cextraordinary cir-\ncumstances\u201d requirement \u201cexists in order to balance \nthe broad language of Rule 60(b)(6), which allows \ncourts to set aside judgments for \u2018any\u2019 reason justify-\ning relief, with the interest in the finality of judg-\nments.\u201d Budget Blinds, Inc. v. White, 536 F.3d 244, \n255 (3d Cir. 2008). When considering a motion to \namend a complaint, finality interests are \u201cbalance[d] \n. . . with the preference expressed in the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure in general, and Rule 15 in particu-\nlar, for resolving disputes on their merits.\u201d Krupski v. \nCosta Crociere S. p. A., 560 U.S. 538, 550 (2010).  \nThird, this case does involve truly \u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d because (1) the district court dismissed \nthe complaint using a set of \u201cwrong legal standards,\u201d \nincluding the nearly impossible requirement of alleg-\ning, without the opportunity for any discovery, \u201cacts or \nstatements\u201d of \u201cBLOM employees\u201d to demonstrate the \nbank\u2019s knowledge; (2) the circuit court rejected those \nstandards on appeal\u2014including the direct evidence re-\nquirement\u2014and \u201cclarified\u201d the correct ones; (3) the cir-\ncuit court found that Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations were none-\ntheless too \u201climited\u201d to meet the clarified standards, \ndrawing a newly announced distinction between \nPlaintiffs\u2019 \u201cpublicly available\u201d evidence and \u201cpublic \nsources such as media articles,\u201d Pet.App.50 & n.18; (4) \nthe circuit court identified several remediable defects \n\n \n \n \n \n \n3 \n \nin the complaint that the district court had not, such \nas clarifying that cash withdrawals are untraceable \nand alleging the degree to which Israeli terrorism des-\nignations were publicized; and (5) Plaintiffs had not \nyet amended their complaint even once. In these one-\nof-a-kind circumstances, the Rules\u2019 strong preference \nfor deciding cases on their merits entitles Plaintiffs to \nhave at least one opportunity to cure those defects. \nBLOM\u2019s argument is therefore premised on con-\nstruing the case\u2019s procedural history to suggest the \nSecond Circuit found that Plaintiffs \u201cwaived\u201d their \nright to amend post-judgment but nevertheless \u201cdi-\nrected district courts to override and rescue parties \nfrom their \u2018free, calculated, [and] deliberate choices,\u2019\u201d \nsuch as \u201cwhen the movant has consistently and con-\nsciously rejected numerous invitations and opportuni-\nties to amend.\u201d Pet.Br.28-29 (citations omitted).  \nBut the Second Circuit never accepted BLOM\u2019s \n\u201cwaiver\u201d argument. To the contrary, it recognized that \nPlaintiffs did not have a meaningful opportunity to \namend at all because \u201cthe district court applied the \nwrong legal standard for aiding-and-abetting liability \nunder JASTA,\u201d Pet.App.5, and a standard for pleading \nknowledge that was \u201ctoo exacting,\u201d Pet.App.49. In fact, \nthe district court\u2019s knowledge pleading standard was \nunmeetable\u2014as Circuit Court Judge Wesley noted in \nresponse to BLOM\u2019s insistence at oral argument that \nPlaintiffs waived opportunities to amend: \u201cWhat are \nthey supposed to do? They know they can\u2019t amend [to] \n. . . meet that.\u201d Oral Arg. at 11:52-:56, Honickman, No. \n22-1039 (2d Cir. Oct. 5, 2023), https://ww3.ca2. \nuscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/6a33dfa3-27c7-4b0a-\n82ee-86c41553c09a/1/doc/22-1039.mp3. \nIgnoring this, BLOM further insists that \u201cthe Sec-\nond Circuit affirmed the dismissal on grounds that the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n4 \n \nDistrict Court had relied on,\u201d Pet.Br. 40\u2014but the dis-\ntrict court itself acknowledged that the decision was \naffirmed \u201con other grounds.\u201d Pet.App.10. Most im-\nportantly, BLOM\u2019s reading of the record is irrelevant \nto the question presented\u2014the summary order below \nwas not premised on any such finding and thus did not \ndirect district courts to \u201coverride\u201d waivers.  \nThe unusual procedural history of this case makes \nclear that no meaningful opportunities to satisfy the \ncorrect legal standards were available to Plaintiffs and \ntherefore the remand to the district court was not a \ndeparture from Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s long-recognized stand-\nards. Rather, in the Second Circuit parties who de-\nclined meaningful invitations \u201care not entitled to relief \nfrom the judgment.\u201d Metzler Inv. GmbH v. Chipotle \nMexican Grill, Inc., 970 F.3d 133, 148 (2d Cir. 2020).  \nThis is not unusual\u2014the circuits broadly require \ndistrict courts to provide at least one opportunity to \namend, often after dismissal when the complaint\u2019s re-\nmediable defects, if any, are correctly identified by a \ncourt ruling. Refusing leave to amend after dismissal \nis thus often an abuse of discretion\u2014the result is no \ndifferent here, except that Plaintiffs were compelled to \nappeal the district court\u2019s erroneous decision first. \nSTATEMENT \nI. \nThe Complaint and Pre-Motion Conference \nfor BLOM\u2019s Motion to Dismiss \nPlaintiffs filed their complaint on January 1, 2019, \nasserting claims under the Anti-Terrorism Act \n(\u201cATA\u201d), as amended by the Justice Against Sponsors \nof Terrorism Act (\u201cJASTA\u201d), and alleging that BLOM \naided and abetted a series of terrorist attacks commit-\nted by the Palestinian foreign terrorist organization \n(\u201cFTO\u201d) Hamas (or \u201cHAMAS\u201d) that injured Plaintiffs. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n5 \n \nSpecifically, Plaintiffs alleged that BLOM knowingly \nprovided substantial assistance to three Hamas fund-\nraisers (the \u201cThree Customers\u201d), including the pur-\nported charitable institution Sanabil, which the \nUnited States designated a Specially Designated \nGlobal Terrorist (\u201cSDGT\u201d) in 2003. Relying in part on \nfinancial records disclosed during the criminal trial of \nthe Holy Land Foundation (\u201cHLF,\u201d a notorious Hamas \nfundraiser) in Texas, Plaintiffs alleged that BLOM as-\nsisted the Three Customers in converting millions of \ndollars of donations from HLF and other Hamas sup-\nporters abroad into cash (notwithstanding BLOM\u2019s de-\nscription of its services as \u201croutine,\u201d Pet.Br.5-6), which \nthey used, inter alia, to recruit Palestinians living in \nLebanon to join and support Hamas before and during \nthe \u201cSecond Intifada,\u201d when the acts of terrorism at is-\nsue here occurred.  \nPlaintiffs alleged BLOM\u2019s knowledge by \u201crefer-\nences to media articles and publications on the Three \nCustomers\u2019 connection to Hamas.\u201d Pet.App.49. Plain-\ntiffs also alleged that Sanabil\u2019s board included contem-\nporaneous Hamas leaders in Lebanon. JA.105, 114. \nPlaintiffs alleged that Israel designated another one of \nthe Three Customers, the Union of Good, as \u201cpart of \nthe Hamas organization\u201d in 2002, during the relevant \nperiod (1998-2004, JA.82). JA.118. The Union of \nGood\u2019s infamous leader, Sheikh Qaradawi, regularly \nappeared on television during that period extolling the \nvirtues of suicide bombings against Israel. JA.120.  \nPlaintiffs also alleged that BLOM converted mil-\nlions of dollars for the Three Customers from not only \nHLF, but also from its successor KindHearts after the \nUnited States designated HLF an SDGT in 2001, \nJA.99-100, 106-13, 117, and from Al Aqsa Foundation \nafter Israel designated it a Hamas entity and its \n\n \n \n \n \n \n6 \n \nheadquarters were shuttered by the German govern-\nment\u2014and one transaction after the United States \ndesignated it an SDGT. JA.95-96, 113.  \nOn May 3, 2019, BLOM filed a letter requesting a \npre-motion conference to initiate a motion to dismiss \nthe complaint for failure to state a claim, setting forth \na summary of its anticipated arguments. JA.142-47. \nThese arguments, which the district court later \nadopted in dismissing the complaint, were incon-\nsistent with JASTA\u2019s plain language, the interpreta-\ntive guidance in Halberstam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472 \n(D.C. Cir. 1983)\u2014which Congress set as the legal \nframework for JASTA\u2014and the Second Circuit\u2019s then-\nonly prior JASTA ruling in Linde v. Arab Bank, PLC, \n882 F.3d 314 (2d Cir. 2018).  \nPlaintiffs provided a summary of their anticipated \nopposition in a letter on May 8, 2019. JA.148-55. Spe-\ncifically, Plaintiffs relied on the standards from both \nLinde and Halberstam and noted that foreseeability \nwas the key factor in assessing a defendant\u2019s wrongful \nconduct under JASTA. As shown below, the district \ncourt ultimately adopted BLOM\u2019s arguments and re-\njected foreseeability. See Pet.App.71-72. The Second \nCircuit subsequently vindicated Plaintiffs\u2019 analysis, as \ndid this Court four years later. See Twitter, Inc. v. \nTaamneh, 598 U.S. 471, 496 (2023).  \nThe district court held a pre-motion conference on \nMay 15, 2019. After raising sua sponte whether BLOM \nhad an affirmative defense based on the statute of lim-\nitations, Pet.App.91, the court then stated:  \nI am just wondering if it might be prudent to \nallow the plaintiffs to amend their complaint, \nnot to add more claims, not to add more parties, \nbut rather to factually support some of the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n7 \n \nclaims that [defense counsel] have identified as \nbeing deficient regarding the standards that \nwere adopted by [Linde] from [Halberstam]. \n[Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel], do you want that oppor-\ntunity?  \nPet.App.93. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel responded, \u201cNo, I think \nwe are prepared to brief it based on the arguments pre-\nsented in [our] pre-motion letter.\u201d Id. This position was \nappropriate given that Plaintiffs\u2019 readings of Linde \nand Halberstam were substantively correct, whereas \nBLOM\u2019s contrary positions were not. \nFollowing the pre-motion conference, the district \ncourt issued a Minute Entry and Scheduling Order \nnoting: \u201cThe Court offered Plaintiffs an opportunity to \namend their complaint to add additional information \nin response to the arguments raised by Defendant. \nPlaintiffs declined . . . to amend their Complaint in \nthis regard.\u201d JA.156 (emphasis added). That is, the \ndistrict court offered Plaintiffs the opportunity to meet \nBLOM\u2019s urged legal standards, which they reasonably \ndeclined\u2014as shown by the circuit\u2019s later \u201cclarification\u201d \nof the applicable standards. \nII. \nThe Motion to Dismiss \nThe parties then briefed the motion to dismiss, in \nwhich they presented arguments largely consistent \nwith the summaries set forth in their pre-motion let-\nters.  \nDuring oral argument on the motion to dismiss, \nBLOM\u2019s counsel relied heavily on a district court deci-\nsion, Kaplan v. Lebanese Canadian Bank, SAL, 405 F. \nSupp. 3d 525 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (\u201cKaplan I\u201d), vac\u2019d in rel-\nevant part, 999 F.3d 842 (2d Cir. 2021) (\u201cKaplan II\u201d). \nKaplan I dismissed JASTA claims against Lebanese \nCanadian Bank (\u201cLCB\u201d), premised on allegations that \n\n \n \n \n \n \n8 \n \nLCB provided financial services for the terrorist group \nHezbollah. As BLOM pointed out, BLOM allegedly \nprovided financial services for Hamas fundraisers in \nLebanon much as LCB did for entities controlled by \nHezbollah. Pet.App.131. \nBLOM urged the district court to adopt Kaplan I\u2019s \nerroneous pleading standards\u2014including its unwork-\nable standard for pleading scienter. Under that stand-\nard, the Kaplan I district court held that public state-\nments and media reports tying five of LCB\u2019s customers \nto Hezbollah could not support an inference of LCB\u2019s \nknowledge of those ties because \u201cPlaintiffs nowhere al-\nlege . . . that Defendant read or was aware of such \nsources.\u201d 405 F. Supp. 3d at 535. Naturally, before dis-\ncovery, a plaintiff will rarely be able to find support for \nwhat sources a defendant has actually \u201cread\u201d or was \naware of. See Pet.App.50 n.18 (\u201cpublic sources\u201d can \n\u201cplausibly suggest a defendant\u2019s knowledge which can \nbe confirmed during discovery\u201d) (emphasis added).  \nNonetheless, BLOM\u2019s counsel argued: \nFinally, I wanted to point out that the level of \nknowledge that Judge Daniels rejected in \nKaplan [I] was very much what\u2019s claimed here, \nwhere it said that it was notorious that there \nwere links between the accounts at issue there, \nbetween those persons and in that case, Hezbol-\nlah. And that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s said here. It was \napparently notorious that BLOM should have \nknown that these accounts were linked to HA-\nMAS, but there\u2019s no direct allegation of why \nBLOM should have known that.  \nPet.App.131. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel disagreed, arguing \n\u201cKaplan [I] requires a level of proof that is out of step \n\n \n \n \n \n \n9 \n \nwith JASTA, out of step with Linde and would be im-\npossible to meet.\u201d Pet.App.126.  \nDuring the oral argument, the district court again \nasked: \u201cThere are no facts that you would have to offer \nto address some of the contentions of the defendants \nregarding knowledge, especially?\u201d Pet.App.125 (em-\nphasis added). But these \u201ccontentions\u201d premised on \nKaplan I were impossible to meet on amendment\u2014\nPlaintiffs possessed no evidence that any BLOM em-\nployee \u201cread or was aware of\u201d any specific piece of in-\nformation. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel explained that while \nthey \u201ccould always add allegations, . . . the complaint \ngoes far enough in saying that BLOM holding accounts \nfor Specially Designated Global Terrorists designated \nfor . . . financing HAMAS, was generally aware of its \nrole in that [il]licit conduct, and . . . the violence that \nresulted from it was foreseeable\u201d as set forth in Linde. \nId. \nIII. \nThe District Court\u2019s Decision on the Motion \nto Dismiss and First Appeal \nThe district court granted BLOM\u2019s motion to dis-\nmiss on January 14, 2020 (\u201cHonickman I\u201d), largely on \nthe grounds BLOM raised, including\u2014as BLOM \nurged\u2014by relying heavily on Kaplan I. The district \ncourt called Kaplan I \u201ca more appropriate comparison\u201d \nand \u201ca more appropriate point of reference\u201d than other \nJASTA and ATA cases to which Plaintiffs analogized \ntheir complaint. Pet.App.77, 84.  \nFor example, and of particular importance to the \nquestion presented here, the district court adopted \nKaplan I\u2019s \u201cread-or-was-aware-of\u201d standard for plead-\ning knowledge. The district court explained that in \nKaplan I, \n\n \n \n \n \n \n10 \n \nalthough the plaintiffs argued that the entities\u2019 \nconnections to Hizbollah \u201cwas [sic] openly, pub-\nlicly and repeatedly acknowledged and publi-\ncized by Hizbollah [through its own sources]\u201d \nand \u201cin various English-language publications,\u201d \nthe plaintiffs \u201cnowhere allege[d] . . . that [LCB] \nread or was aware of such sources.\u201d The same \nanalysis applies even more strongly here, given \nthe relatively greater strength of the allegations \nin Kaplan [I]. \nPet.App.79 (quoting Kaplan I, 405 F. Supp. 3d at 535) \n(emphasis added). Having adopted this position, the \ndistrict court then faulted Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint for \nlacking allegations citing \u201cacts or statements by \nBLOM or BLOM\u2019s employees\u201d regarding its customers\u2019 \naffiliations with Hamas, instead relying on \u201cpress ar-\nticles, government actions, and allegedly \u2018public \nknowledge\u2019 discussing\u201d such connections. Pet.App.73-\n74.  \nUnsurprisingly, financial institutions do not often \npublicly admit their knowledge of their roles in assist-\ning terrorism. Therefore, moving to amend after dis-\nmissal in this case\u2014or accepting the district court\u2019s in-\nvitations to amend, such as during oral argument \nwhere BLOM demanded \u201cdirect allegation[s]\u201d of its \nknowledge, Pet.App.131\u2014would have been pointless. \nAnd while the Second Circuit also ultimately found \nPlaintiffs\u2019 allegations of BLOM\u2019s knowledge of the \nThree Customers\u2019 Hamas affiliations insufficient, it \ndid so for reasons that could be remedied by replead-\ning\u2014such as by pleading more allegations of (1) \u201cpub-\nlic sources\u201d demonstrating that Israeli terrorism des-\nignations were made public, (2) banks\u2019 policies for \nmonitoring counterparties, and (3) the untraceable na-\nture of cash. None of those grounds required alleging \n\n \n \n \n \n \n11 \n \nBLOM\u2019s internal communications or deliberations at \nthe pleading stage showing that BLOM \u201cread or was \naware\u201d of such sources.  \nPlaintiffs timely appealed the district court\u2019s dis-\nmissal decision. Because Kaplan I was also on appeal, \nthe Second Circuit held Honickman in abeyance and \ndirected the parties to submit supplemental briefs on \nthe \u201cissue of how [Kaplan] applies to this case,\u201d once \ndecided. JA.257-258. The circuit subsequently issued \nKaplan II, vacating Kaplan I\u2019s dismissal of JASTA aid-\ning and abetting claims against LCB. See 999 F.3d \n842. Kaplan II largely clarified the standards for \nJASTA liability, as Plaintiffs explained in their sup-\nplemental brief. JA.259-281. BLOM, however, argued \nthat Kaplan II somehow \u201cunderscore[d] the soundness \nof the District Court\u2019s legal analysis,\u201d despite vacating \nits primary support\u2014Kaplan I. JA.294. The circuit \nthen issued its first decision in Honickman on July 29, \n2021 (\u201cHonickman II\u201d). \nIV. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s Assessment of the Dis-\ntrict Court\u2019s Dismissal Decision  \nThe Second Circuit \u201cagree[d]\u201d with Plaintiffs \u201cthat \nthe [district] court did not apply the proper standard \n. . . .\u201d Pet.App.24. Specifically, the circuit rejected \nevery standard the district court applied as grounds \nfor dismissal, including the direct-evidence standard \nfor alleging BLOM\u2019s knowledge of the Three Custom-\ners\u2019 affiliations with Hamas. It also rejected the dis-\ntrict court\u2019s standards for alleging the general aware-\nness and substantial assistance elements, which to-\ngether \u201cform the crux of most JASTA aiding-and-abet-\nting cases.\u201d Pet.App.37. These holdings are detailed \nbelow. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n12 \n \nBLOM \nlargely \nignores \nthese \nholdings. \nSee \nPet.Br.40. But the district court was more forthcom-\ning\u2014it acknowledged that the circuit court only af-\nfirmed on \u201cother grounds.\u201d Pet.App.10. BLOM also \ntries to rehabilitate the district court\u2019s dismissal order \nby suggesting it conforms to this Court\u2019s analysis in \nTaamneh. See Pet.Br.6-7, 8 n.2. But, of course, \nTaamneh affirmed the foreseeability standard from \nHalberstam\u2014the Honickman district court, \u201chowever, \nrejected the foreseeability principle.\u201d Pet.App.39.  \nMoreover, Taamneh had not been issued when \nPlaintiffs sought post-judgment amendment to meet \nthe Second Circuit\u2019s \u201cclarifications\u201d in Kaplan II and \nHonickman II. The issue in this case is the standard \nfor post-judgment amendment where a district court \nhas misapplied controlling law\u2014that is, the law of the \ncircuit. And even if Taamneh had completely repudi-\nated the Second Circuit\u2019s interpretation of JASTA, \nthat would only have provided a further reason to af-\nford Plaintiffs an opportunity to meet this Court\u2019s \nnewly-articulated standard. \nA. The District Court Applied the Wrong \nStandard for Pleading Knowledge \nThe most decisive problem with the district court\u2019s \ndismissal decision was its articulated standard for \npleading knowledge, which required Plaintiffs to al-\nlege \u201cacts or statements by BLOM or BLOM\u2019s employ-\nees\u201d showing their knowledge. Pet.App.73. The Second \nCircuit explained why this standard was incorrect:  \nIn assessing this element, the district court \nfound that the complaint\u2019s references to media \narticles and publications on the Three Custom-\ners\u2019 connection to Hamas were insufficient be-\ncause \u201cPlaintiffs fail[ed] plausibly to allege that \n\n \n \n \n \n \n13 \n \nBLOM [Bank] . . . actually knew or should have \nknown of any of the cited sources.\u201d However, as \nwe explained in Kaplan [II], Plaintiffs did not \nneed to allege that BLOM Bank knew or should \nhave known of the public sources at the plead-\ning stage. Such a requirement at this juncture \nwould be too exacting. \nPet.App.49 (citations omitted). \nThe district court had adopted its erroneous stand-\nard from Kaplan I, before it was vacated in relevant \npart. In Kaplan II, the circuit explained that \u201c[a] com-\nplaint is allowed to contain general allegations as to a \ndefendant\u2019s knowledge because \u2018a plaintiff realistically \ncannot be expected to plead a defendant\u2019s actual state \nof mind,\u2019\u201d although plaintiffs must \u201cinclude allegations \nof the facts or events they claim give rise to an infer-\nence of knowledge.\u201d 999 F.3d at 864 (citations omit-\nted). Moreover, the district court must \u201cconsider all of \nthe complaint\u2019s allegations, rather than considering \neach in isolation, and to accept as true all permissible \ninferences that could be drawn from the complaint as \na whole.\u201d Id. at 865.1  \nThis correction is critical. While Plaintiffs\u2019 pro-\nposed amended complaint submitted in support of \n \n1  \nThe Honickman district court also echoed Kaplan I in \npointing out that with one exception cited in the complaint, the \nU.S. did not designate the Three Customers or their counterpar-\nties as SDGTs until after the transfers at issue (although Israel \nhad designated several of the counterparties as terrorist organi-\nzations years before). See Pet.App.74-75. The circuit rejected this \nstandard in Kaplan II as well, writing: \u201cThe [Kaplan I] court cited \nno authority for such a prerequisite for knowledge, and we know \nof none; and it would defy common sense to hold that such \nknowledge could be gained in no other way.\u201d 999 F.3d at 864. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n14 \n \ntheir vacatur motion contained numerous additional \n\u201cpublic source\u201d allegations (including publications in \nEnglish, French and Arabic) to further support the \n\u201cpermissible inferences\u201d of BLOM\u2019s contemporaneous \nknowledge that it was providing substantial assis-\ntance to Hamas, JA.315-508, those allegations would \nnot satisfy Kaplan I\u2019s \u201cread or was aware of\u201d require-\nment adopted by the district court below. \nB. The District Court Applied the Wrong \nJASTA Standards \nThe Second Circuit also explained that the district \ncourt applied the wrong standards for assessing the \nJASTA elements.  \nAs to general awareness, the Second Circuit first \nset forth the standard given in Halberstam and \nacknowledged in Linde: \u201c[t]he defendant need not be \ngenerally aware of its role in the specific act that \ncaused the plaintiff\u2019s injury; instead, it must be gener-\nally aware of its role in an overall illegal activity from \nwhich the act that caused the plaintiff\u2019s injury was \nforeseeable.\u201d Pet.App.37 (citing Halberstam, 705 F.2d \nat 477, 488). It then explained that the district court \ndid not apply this standard:  \nThe district court, however, rejected the foresee-\nability principle, holding that \u201cit is not enough \nfor Plaintiffs to plausibl[y] allege that BLOM \n[Bank] was generally aware of [its] role in ter-\nrorist activities, from which terrorist attacks \nwere a natural and foreseeable consequence.\u201d \nThe court\u2019s conclusion contravenes both Hal-\nberstam and Linde[], one of the first cases in \nwhich we interpreted aiding-and-abetting lia-\nbility under JASTA. \nPet.App.39 (quoting Pet.App.71-72).  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n15 \n \nIn Taamneh, this Court likewise confirmed that:  \nAs Halberstam makes clear, people who aid and \nabet a tort can be held liable for other torts that \nwere \u201ca foreseeable risk\u201d of the intended \ntort. Accordingly, a close nexus between the as-\nsistance and the tort might help establish that \nthe defendant aided and abetted the tort, but \neven more remote support can still constitute \naiding and abetting in the right case. \n598 U.S. at 496 (quoting Halberstam, 705 F.2d at 488). \nThe Second Circuit rejected BLOM\u2019s argument \nthat providing indirect assistance changes the stand-\nard for pleading knowledge, explaining that \u201cKaplan \n[II] did not so hold; instead, it asserted \u2018the actual \nknowledge component of the Halberstam standard re-\nquires that the defendant \u201cknow[ ]\u201d that it is providing \n\u201cassistance,\u201d . . . whether directly to the FTO or indi-\nrectly through an intermediary.\u2019\u201d Pet.App.46 n.16 \n(quoting Kaplan II, 999 F.3d at 863-64). See also \nPet.App.45 n.15 (rejecting BLOM\u2019s argument regard-\ning customer activities).  \nThe circuit\u2019s Honickman II and Kaplan II decisions \nalso rejected the district court\u2019s assertion that \u201cthe \nmere provision of routine banking services to an FTO \ndoes not render a bank liable for civil aiding and abet-\nting.\u201d Pet.App.71. The Kaplan II court explained that \nso-called \u201croutine\u201d services could suffice depending on \nthe circumstances, and that, under Linde, \u201cwhether a \ndefendant bank\u2019s \u2018financial services to [an FTO or its \naffiliates should or] should not be viewed as routine\u2019 is \na \u2018question[] of fact for a jury to decide.\u2019\u201d 999 F.3d at \n858 (quoting Linde, 882 F.3d at 327) (alterations orig-\ninal to Kaplan II). See also Taamneh, 598 U.S. at 502 \n(noting circumstances \u201cwhere the provider of routine \n\n \n \n \n \n \n16 \n \nservices\u201d could be liable for \u201caiding and abetting a fore-\nseeable terror attack\u201d). \nThe Second Circuit also found that the district \ncourt applied incorrect standards to plead the knowing \nand substantial assistance element. This included \nmisapprehending the \u201cknowing\u201d prong under circuit \nlaw2 and misapplying each of the Halberstam substan-\ntial assistance factors it analyzed. Pet.App.45.  \nThe district court \u201cmisunderstood the first factor, \n\u2018the nature of the act encouraged,\u2019 to be a question of \nwhether Plaintiffs plausibly alleged \u2018that BLOM \n[Bank] knowingly encouraged Hamas\u2019[s] violent activ-\nities, such as those which caused Plaintiffs\u2019 injuries.\u2019\u201d \nPet.App.46. Indeed, the Halberstam defendant did not \n\u201cencourage\u201d her burglar boyfriend to commit the un-\nplanned murder of Dr. Halberstam, of which she had \nno knowledge.  \nThe district court also applied too exacting a stand-\nard for \u201cthe second factor, \u2018the amount of assistance,\u2019\u201d \nrequiring allegations of how the money BLOM moved \nfor Hamas actually made it through the FTO\u2019s fronts. \nTo the contrary, \u201c[f]actual allegations that permit a \nreasonable inference that the defendant recognized \nthe money it transferred to its customers would be re-\nceived by the FTO would suffice.\u201d Pet.App.47. \n \n2  \nThe Second Circuit did not, as some JASTA defendants \nhave suggested, \u201canalyze[] the \u2018knowing\u2019 subelement as a carbon \ncopy of the antecedent element of whether the defendants were \n\u2018generally aware\u2019 of their role in ISIS\u2019 overall scheme.\u201d Taamneh, \n598 U.S. at 503 (citations omitted). It only observed that the same \nfacts could satisfy both mental state elements: \u201cFor instance, Hal-\nberstam . . . . did not require [the defendant] to \u2018know\u2019 anything \nmore about [the murderer\u2019s] unlawful activities than what she \nknew for the general awareness element.\u201d Pet.App.46.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n17 \n \nFinally, under the fourth factor, the defendant\u2019s re-\nlation to the principal, \u201c[t]he district court erroneously \nconstrued\u201d Second Circuit precedent \u201cto mean that \nPlaintiffs must plead a direct relationship between \nBLOM Bank and Hamas.\u201d Pet.App.47-48. A less direct \nrelationship, depending on the circumstances, could \nsuffice. \nAgain, these errors align with BLOM\u2019s \u201cargu-\nments\u201d and \u201ccontentions\u201d to which the district court \ninvited Plaintiffs to respond by amendment. JA.156, \nPet.App.125. Plaintiffs reasonably declined these invi-\ntations, as evidenced by the Second Circuit\u2019s complete \nrejection of them. \nC. The Second Circuit Affirmed the District \nCourt Decision Only on Another Ground \nThe Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal decision \nentirely on one ground: \u201cWe conclude that Plaintiffs\u2019 \naiding-and-abetting claim fails because the allegations \ndo not support an inference that BLOM Bank was \naware of the Three Customers\u2019 ties with Hamas prior \nto the relevant attacks, thereby undermining the sec-\nond element of general awareness.\u201d Pet.App.49. But \nwhereas the district court required allegations of \u201cacts \nor statements\u201d from \u201cBLOM employees\u201d demonstrat-\ning their actual knowledge (which Plaintiffs naturally \ndid not have before discovery), the Second Circuit \nidentified a less exacting set of specific and remediable \ndeficiencies in the complaint\u2019s knowledge allegations. \nChief among these was the circuit\u2019s finding that \nPlaintiffs\u2019 evidence of the Three Customers\u2019 Hamas af-\nfiliations was \u201cpublicly available,\u201d rather than from \n\u201cpublic sources\u201d: \nHowever, \u201cpublicly available\u201d evidence is not \nthe same as public sources such as media \n\n \n \n \n \n \n18 \n \narticles. The latter, depending on their sub-\nstance, \nplausibly \nsuggest \na \ndefendant\u2019s \nknowledge which can be confirmed during dis-\ncovery, whereas the former requires the implau-\nsible inference that the defendant was aware of \nthose facts even before the news media. \nPet.App.50 n.18. The court then went on to find Plain-\ntiffs\u2019 allegations of \u201cpublic sources\u201d too \u201climited\u201d in de-\ntail and numerosity. Pet.App.51. \nPlaintiffs understandably did not anticipate this \nnew evidentiary distinction (the district court cer-\ntainly did not). Moreover, the Second Circuit did not \ncite any precedent for this position, and it is by all ap-\npearances a newly articulated distinction. Nor did the \nKaplan II decision mention any distinction between \n\u201cpublicly available evidence\u201d and \u201cpublic sources\u201d of \nevidence. In fact, \u201cpublicly available evidence\u201d echoes \nthe term the Second Circuit had previously used as a \nbasis for inferring knowledge, relying on this Court\u2019s \nprecedent: \u201cPublicly available information may pro-\nvide relevant circumstantial evidence of actual \nknowledge.\u201d Fed. Hous. Fin. Agency v. Nomura Hold-\ning Am., Inc., 873 F.3d 85, 122 (2d Cir. 2017) (empha-\nsis added) (citing Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa, 539 U.S. \n90, 100 (2003)). Indeed, it seems reasonable that \nbanks, given their unique Know-Your-Customer obli-\ngations and due diligence policies, which assume close \nmonitoring of customer accounts and transactions, \nwould know facts about their customers \u201cbefore the \nnews media\u201d report it (which involves deciding what is \nnewsworthy and what facts are verifiable).  \nBut no matter\u2014Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed amended com-\nplaint included numerous and detailed allegations of \ncontemporaneous \u201cpublic sources\u201d to meet the Second \nCircuit\u2019s requirement.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n19 \n \nThe other defects the circuit identified were also re-\nmediable. For example, the circuit discounted Plain-\ntiffs\u2019 assertion that BLOM must have noticed that the \nThree Customers were receiving funds from desig-\nnated terrorist entities. The circuit noted that the com-\nplaint alleged that Sanabil received transfers from the \n\u201cAl-Aqsa Foundation\u201d after Israel designated it as a \nterrorist organization, but not \u201cwhether and where \nthis [designation] was made public.\u201d Pet.App.52 n.20. \nThe circuit also noted that the complaint needed \u201cfur-\nther allegations\u201d to show that a defendant-bank would \nknow about \u201ctransfers of funds from non-customers as-\nsociated with an FTO to the defendant\u2019s customers.\u201d \nId.  \nThese defects were not due to unreasonable draft-\ning\u2014previous ATA decisions found it reasonable to in-\nfer that a foreign bank would \u201cmonitor publicly avail-\nable information,\u201d including \u201cIsraeli lists of terrorists.\u201d \nWeiss v. Nat\u2019l Westminster Bank PLC, 453 F. Supp. \n2d 609, 627 (E.D.N.Y. 2006) (emphasis added). But the \nproposed amended complaint now includes media re-\nports on the relevant Israeli designations and BLOM\u2019s \nown customer due diligence procedures, such as moni-\ntoring transfer counterparties and non-profit organi-\nzations, which are often used as terror fronts.  \nSimilarly, although Plaintiffs repeatedly empha-\nsized the suspicious nature of Sanabil making large \ncash withdrawals from its BLOM account, the circuit \nsuggesting that the complaint should more explicitly \nallege that cash is \u201cuntraceable.\u201d Pet.App.51 n.19. Alt-\nhough Plaintiffs took that characteristic of cash to be \na reasonable inference rather than a necessary allega-\ntion, they included those explicit allegations in the \nproposed amended complaint. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n20 \n \nV. \nPlaintiffs\u2019 Motion to Vacate and Amend and \nthe Second Appeal \nAs the Second Circuit explained in the summary \norder below, the district court had applied the \u201cwrong \nlegal standards\u201d in dismissing the complaint, so once \n\u201c[a]rmed with this Court\u2019s clarifications, Plaintiffs re-\nturned to the district court,\u201d promptly moving (11 days \nafter Honickman II issued\u2014in fact, before the man-\ndate issued) under Rules 60(b)(6) and 15(a)(2) to va-\ncate the judgment of dismissal and grant them leave \nto file a first amended complaint. JA.315. The district \ncourt denied the motion, concluding that Plaintiffs \nfailed to show extraordinary circumstances chiefly be-\ncause they declined the district court\u2019s two prior invi-\ntations to meet the erroneous and largely impossible \npleading standard BLOM urged and that the district \ncourt erroneously adopted.  \nPlaintiffs again appealed. During argument, Cir-\ncuit Court Judge Wesley\u2014who also authored Honick-\nman II\u2014noted the case constituted an \u201cunusual cir-\ncumstance,\u201d 10/5/2023 Oral Arg. at 3:40, and \u201ca curi-\nous situation,\u201d id. at 10:54, and was \u201cquirky,\u201d id. at \n18:07. And as he recognized, Plaintiffs faced \u201ca wrong \nstandard\u201d \u201cthat\u2019s even harder for them to meet.\u201d Judge \nWesley observed: \u201cWhat are they supposed to do? They \nknow they can\u2019t amend [to] . . . meet that\u201d standard. \nId. at 11:50-56. The dismissal was \u201c[a]ffirmed for a dif-\nferent reason,\u201d as a result of a series of cases \u201cwhere \nthe law was really recasting itself.\u201d Id. at 13:12-38. \nAfter that oral argument in this case, the Second \nCircuit decided Mandala, another \u201cone of the excep-\ntional cases necessitating relief from judgment.\u201d Man-\ndala, 88 F.4th at 365. In Mandala, the plaintiffs \nbrought a putative class action alleging that defendant \nNTT Data\u2019s policy of not hiring people with felony \n\n \n \n \n \n \n21 \n \nconvictions disproportionately harms Black appli-\ncants. See id. at 357. The plaintiffs cited government \nreports showing \u201cBlack people are arrested and incar-\ncerated at higher rates than others.\u201d Id. The district \ncourt dismissed the complaint because it did not show \nthat there was a similar disparity among Black appli-\ncants for NTT\u2019s positions specifically.  \nThe Second Circuit affirmed, \u201cagree[ing] with the \ndistrict court\u201d that the complaint\u2019s statistics did not \nfocus on \u201cappropriate comparator groups.\u201d Id. at 357-\n58 (citation omitted). However, the circuit recognized \n\u201cthat such granular data may be impossible to collect \nwithout discovery,\u201d and that \u201cthe Complaint might \nhave survived dismissal if it had contained allegations \nexplaining \u2018why their chosen national statistics are in \nfact likely to be representative of NTT\u2019s qualified ap-\nplicant pool.\u2019\u201d Id. at 358 (citation omitted). The plain-\ntiffs petitioned for rehearing en banc, and although it \nwas denied, the dissenting judges urged the plaintiffs \nto move for vacatur and leave to amend. The plaintiffs \ndid, and the district court denied the motion.  \nOn appeal, the second Mandala panel acknowl-\nedged that \u201c[i]t wasn\u2019t until this Court\u2019s decision on \nappeal that it became clear what other types of infor-\nmation might suffice at the pleading stage.\u201d Id. at 365. \nAs a result, the panel vacated that denial and re-\nmanded the motion for reconsideration given Foman, \nthe Second Circuit cases Metzler and Williams, and \nother precedents.  \nRecognizing that its \u201cdiscussion of the various con-\nsiderations in Mandala will be particularly helpful to \nthe district court\u2019s analysis\u201d of Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for \nvacatur and leave to amend, the Second Circuit issued \nthe summary order below, likewise citing Foman and \nMetzler. Pet.App.1-8. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n22 \n \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n1. Second Circuit precedent does not meaningfully \ndiffer from other circuits\u2019 post-judgment amendment \nholdings. The summary order below does not \u201chold\u201d \nanything, and the precedents it cites are typical of \nRule 60(b)(6) cases. For example, they uncontrover-\nsially hold that \u201c[r]elief under Rule 60(b)(6) is reserved \nfor cases that present \u2018extraordinary circumstances.\u2019\u201d \nMandala, 88 F.4th at 361 (quoting Liljeberg v. Health \nServs. Acquisition Corp., 486 U.S. 847, 863 (1988)).  \nThis case involves highly exceptional circum-\nstances. The district court applied erroneous stand-\nards for pleading aiding and abetting under JASTA, \nincluding a knowledge pleading standard that was all \nbut impossible to meet. Pet.App.5, 49. Plaintiffs rea-\nsonably declined the district court\u2019s invitation to \namend to meet those erroneous standards. The Second \nCircuit \u201cagree[d]\u201d that those standards were incorrect, \nbut found the complaint did not meet the standards it \n\u201cclarified\u201d on appeal. Pet.App.25, 40 n.11. After the \ndistrict court refused to let Plaintiffs amend their com-\nplaint to meet the clarified standard, the Second Cir-\ncuit directed it to reconsider, given prior precedents. It \ndid not dictate a particular outcome.  \n2. The balancing test the circuit court described is \nalso typical of Rule 60(b)(6) cases. The Second Circuit \nrejects allowing the \u201cliberal amendment policy of Rule \n15(a) to swallow the philosophy favoring finality of \njudgments whole.\u201d Metzler, 970 F.3d at 146 (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted). Rather, the \ntest balances Rule 60(b)\u2019s value of finality \u201cwith the \npreference expressed in the Federal Rules of Civil Pro-\ncedure in general, and Rule 15 in particular, for resolv-\ning disputes on their merits.\u201d Krupski, 560 U.S. at \n550. After all, \u201cthe \u2018whole purpose\u2019 of Rule 60(b) \u2018is to \n\n \n \n \n \n \n23 \n \nmake an exception to finality.\u2019\u201d Buck v. Davis, 580 U.S. \n100, 126 (2017) (citations omitted). \nThe practical effect of that balance is far more mod-\nest than BLOM suggests: \u201cIn the post-judgment con-\ntext, we have indeed given \u2018due regard\u2019 to \u2018the liberal \nspirit of Rule 15\u2019 by ensuring plaintiffs at least one op-\nportunity to replead.\u201d Metzler, 970 F.3d at 146 (quot-\ning Williams, 659 F.3d at 213-14). See also Mandala, \n88 F.4th at 362 (same). Courts regularly recognize the \nimportance of providing plaintiffs an opportunity to \namend their complaints once apprised of actual defects \nin them. Where the dismissal standards are wrong, \nhowever, \u201cthe proper recourse\u201d is an appeal, United \nStates v. Mask of Ka-Nefer-Nefer, 752 F.3d 737, 743 \n(8th Cir. 2014), which Plaintiffs here took. None of \nBLOM\u2019s cited cases suggest that under the circum-\nstances present here Plaintiffs would not be entitled to \namend. \n3. BLOM\u2019s appeal is premised on the unsupported \ninference that the Second Circuit agreed that Plain-\ntiffs \u201cwaived\u201d their opportunities to amend but then \n\u201cdirected district courts to override and rescue parties \nfrom their \u2018free, calculated, [and] deliberate choices.\u2019\u201d \nPet.Br.28-29. But the Second Circuit did not find any \nwaiver. Quite the opposite, it suggested Plaintiffs rea-\nsonably appealed the district court\u2019s dismissal deci-\nsion and never received a meaningful opportunity to \nmeet the correct and newly clarified standards\u2014and \nthus had nothing to waive.  \nBLOM\u2019s litany of \u201cwaived\u201d opportunities to amend \nare not supported by the record and in any event were \nnot accepted by the panel below in discussing post-\njudgment amendment standards. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n24 \n \n4. The Second Circuit\u2019s precedents do not conflict \nwith the text of Rule 60(b) or Rule 15(a). The Second \nCircuit requires determining which Rule 60(b) provi-\nsion applies as a \u201cthreshold issue,\u201d before considering \namendment. Mandala, 88 F.4th at 359. The desire to \namend a complaint itself is insufficient. \n5. Extraordinary circumstances are clearly present \nhere, for the reasons stated above. Plaintiffs were not \nafforded a meaningful opportunity to address actual \ndefects in their complaint. They properly appealed the \ndistrict court\u2019s erroneous decision and then promptly \nsought vacatur to meet the clarified standards the cir-\ncuit issued on appeal. Discovery has not even com-\nmenced\u2014this case is in its infancy, and Plaintiffs \nshould have the opportunity to have their case adjudi-\ncated on the merits. \nARGUMENT  \nI. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s Analysis Is Consistent \nwith Post-Judgment Amendment Jurispru-\ndence Nationally. \nBLOM asserts that the summary order below \n\u201cabandons the \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 standard \nin favor of a nebulous \u2018balanc[ing]\u2019 inquiry that pits \nRule 60(b)(6)\u2019s protection of \u2018finality\u2019 against \u2018Rule \n15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policies.\u2019\u201d Pet.Br.25 (quot-\ning Pet.App.8). This is inaccurate.  \nFirst, as Respondent acknowledges, the decision \nbelow is a non-precedential summary order which \nmerely \u201c[r]el[ies] on a series of Second Circuit prece-\ndents.\u201d Pet.Br.20. In fact, the order only cites three de-\ncisions on post-judgment amendment\u2014Mandala and \nMetzler from the Second Circuit, and Foman v. Davis, \n371 U.S. 178 (1962), from this Court.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n25 \n \nSecond, these decisions are not erroneous and cer-\ntainly do not \u201cjettison\u201d the extraordinary circum-\nstances standard, as BLOM claims. Pet.Br.14. Man-\ndala holds that \u201c[r]elief under Rule 60(b)(6) is reserved \nfor cases that present \u2018extraordinary circumstances.\u2019\u201d \n88 F.4th at 361 (quoting Liljeberg, 486 U.S. at 863). \nAnd in Metzler, the Second Circuit affirmed denial of \npost-judgment amendment because \u201cthe plaintiffs-ap-\npellants fail[ed] to identify any \u2018extraordinary circum-\nstances\u2019 that would \u2018justify[] relief\u2019 under Rule \n60(b)(6).\u201d 970 F.3d at 147. \nAs explained below, the \u201cextraordinary circum-\nstances\u201d here are clear. This case is, as Judge Wesley \nput it, \u201cunusual,\u201d \u201cquirky,\u201d and \u201ccurious,\u201d appearing to \ndeny Plaintiffs even a single meaningful opportunity \nto amend. The Second Circuit therefore directed the \ndistrict court to reconsider its denial of vacatur given \nthe standards in Mandala and Metzler. As this re-\nmand reflected, Rule 60(b)(6) motions inherently re-\nquire \u201ccase-by-case inquiry,\u201d Stokes v. Williams, 475 \nF.3d 732, 736 (6th Cir. 2007)). Indeed, even if this \nCourt wanted to revisit its jurisprudence on Rule \n60(b), it is difficult to imagine it being able to fashion \nany generally applicable standard based on the \u201cunu-\nsual\u201d procedural history of this case. \nA. Rule 60(b)(6) Jurisprudence Balances Fi-\nnality and the Preference for Deciding \nCases on Their Merits. \nMandala and Metzler both apply the balancing test \narticulated in Williams v. Citigroup: \u201cpostjudgment \nmotions for leave to replead must be evaluated with \ndue regard to both the value of finality and the policies \nembodied in Rule 15.\u201d 659 F.3d at 213. Finality thus \nremains the starting point for applying Rule 60(b)(6) \nin the Second Circuit: \u201c[t]he standards we have \n\n \n \n \n \n \n26 \n \ndeveloped for evaluating postjudgment motions gener-\nally place significant emphasis on the \u2018value of finality \nand repose.\u2019\u201d Id. (citation omitted). The circuit notes \nthat \u2018\u201c[t]o hold otherwise would enable the liberal \namendment policy of Rule 15(a) to be employed in a \nway that is contrary to the philosophy favoring finality \nof judgments and the expeditious termination of liti-\ngation.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Nat\u2019l Petrochemical Co. v. M/T \nStolt Sheaf, 930 F.2d 240, 245 (2d Cir. 1991)). \nFinality is then balanced with Rule 15(a)\u2019s prefer-\nence for resolving cases on their merits, which the Wil-\nliams panel sourced from this Court\u2019s \u201c[p]articularly \ninstructive\u201d Foman decision. 695 F.3d at 213. Foman \nheld that the district court abused its discretion in \ndenying a motion to vacate the judgment in order to \namend the complaint:  \nRule 15(a) declares that leave to amend \u201cshall \nbe freely given when justice so requires\u201d; this \nmandate is to be heeded. See generally, 3 \nMoore, Federal Practice (2d ed. 1948), paras. \n15.08, 15.10. If the underlying facts or circum-\nstances relied upon by a plaintiff may be a \nproper subject of relief, he ought to be afforded \nan opportunity to test his claim on the mer-\nits. In the absence of any apparent or declared \nreason \u2014 such as undue delay, bad faith or di-\nlatory motive on the part of the movant, re-\npeated failure to cure deficiencies by amend-\nments previously allowed, undue prejudice to \nthe opposing party by virtue of allowance of the \namendment, futility of amendment, etc. \u2014 the \nleave sought should, as the rules require, be \n\u201cfreely given.\u201d Of course, the grant or denial of \nan opportunity to amend is within the discre-\ntion of the District Court, but outright refusal to \n\n \n \n \n \n \n27 \n \ngrant the leave without any justifying reason \nappearing for the denial is not an exercise of dis-\ncretion; it is merely abuse of that discretion and \ninconsistent with the spirit of the Federal \nRules. \n371 U.S. at 182.3 See, e.g., United States v. Vorachek, \n563 F.2d 884, 887 (8th Cir. 1977) (vacatur necessary \ngiven Foman and Rule 15(a)).  \nThis Court has always balanced the finality of judg-\nments with the preference for giving plaintiffs \u201can op-\nportunity to test their claims on the merits.\u201d For ex-\nample, this Court \u201cbalance[d] the interests of the de-\nfendant protected by the statute of limitations with \nthe preference expressed in the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure in general, and Rule 15 in particular, for re-\nsolving disputes on their merits.\u201d Krupski, 560 U.S. at \n550. A statute of limitations embodies the value of fi-\nnality and repose, see, e.g., Lozano v. Alvarez, 572 U.S. \n1, 14 (2014), just as, in the Second Circuit, \u201cpostjudg-\nment motions generally place significant emphasis on \n \n3  \nBLOM argues that the circuit erred in relying on Foman \nbecause the vacatur motion in that case was treated as coming \nunder Rule 59(e), not Rule 60(b), and the two rules \u201cdiffer in ma-\nterial ways and impose different standards for relief by their own \nterms.\u201d Pet.Br.18, 34-35. As explained infra 31-32, any such dis-\ntinction does not help BLOM\u2014but it was also completely irrele-\nvant to this Court\u2019s analysis in Foman. The First Circuit had de-\ncided to treat the motion as \u201cfiled pursuant to Rule 59(e), rather \nthan under Rule 60(b)\u201d to resolve an unrelated procedural issue \ninvolving two notices of appeal. Foman v. Davis, 292 F.2d 85, 87 \n(1st Cir. 1961). This Court then noted that the \u201cCourt of Appeals\u2019 \ntreatment of the motion to vacate as one under Rule 59(e) was \npermissible, at least as an original matter, and we will accept \nthat characterization here.\u201d 371 U.S. at 181. It never suggested \nthat the \u201ccharacterization\u201d impacted its review or the vacatur \nstandards it applied.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n28 \n \nthe \u2018value of finality and repose,\u2019\u201d Williams, 659 F.3d \nat 213 (internal citation omitted).  \nThis Court has also always understood Rule 60(b) \nas accommodating that preference, rejecting argu-\nments that overemphasize finality at its expense. For \nexample: \u201c[T]he State reminds us of the importance of \npreserving the finality of judgments. But the \u2018whole \npurpose\u2019 of Rule 60(b) \u2018is to make an exception to final-\nity.\u2019\u201d Buck, 580 U.S. at 126 (citations omitted). BLOM \nrelies heavily on this Court\u2019s analysis of finality in \nGonzalez v. Crosby but omits its conclusion: \u201c[W]e give \nlittle weight to respondent\u2019s appeal to the virtues of \nfinality. That policy consideration, standing alone, is \nunpersuasive in the interpretation of a provision \nwhose whole purpose is to make an exception to final-\nity.\u201d 545 U.S. 524, 529 (2005). Likewise, BLOM quotes \nthis Court\u2019s admonition in United States v. Denedo \nthat \u201cjudgment finality is not to be lightly cast aside,\u201d \nPet.Br.27, but again leaves out the Court\u2019s conclusion: \n\u201cthe finality rule is not so inflexible that it trumps each \nand every competing consideration.\u201d 556 U.S. 904, 916 \n(2009). A \u201cjudgment\u201d based on the wrong reasons, due \nlargely to what the circuit itself concedes to have been \nits own \u201cambigu[ous]\u201d precedent, Pet.App.40 n.11, is \nto be \u201ccast aside\u201d in order to permit disposition on the \nmerits.  \nLike this Court, the Second Circuit rejects \u201ca stand-\nard that overemphasize[s] considerations of finality at \nthe expense of the liberal amendment policy embodied \nin the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\u201d Williams, 659 \nF.3d at 210. And like this Court, the Second Circuit \nholds that \u201cRule 60(b) relief is designed to afford par-\nties an opportunity to resolve a dispute on its merits.\u201d \nNemaizer v. Baker, 793 F.2d 58, 63 (2d Cir. 1986) (cit-\ning 7 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, \u00b6 60.19, at 156 (2d ed. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n29 \n \n1983)). That is, the policies underlying Rules 60(b) and \n15(a) work \u201cin tandem,\u201d as the Second Circuit ex-\nplained below. Pet.App.7. \nThe circuit courts have also consistently recognized \nthis balance inherent in Rule 60(b)(6). The rule\u2019s \u201c[ex-\ntraordinary circumstances] requirement exists in or-\nder to balance the broad language of Rule 60(b)(6), \nwhich allows courts to set aside judgments for \u2018any\u2019 \nreason justifying relief, with the interest in the finality \nof judgments.\u201d Budget Blinds, 536 F.3d at 255. The \nNinth Circuit sourced this principle to Gonzalez:  \nAs the Sixth Circuit rightly held when applying \nGonzalez, \u201cthe decision to grant Rule 60(b)(6) \nrelief is a case-by-case inquiry that requires the \ntrial court to intensively balance numerous fac-\ntors, including the competing policies of the fi-\nnality of judgments and the incessant command \nof the court\u2019s conscience that justice be done in \nlight of all the facts.\u201d  \nPhelps v. Alameida, 569 F.3d 1120, 1133 (9th Cir. \n2009) (quoting Stokes, 475 F.3d at 736). See also In re \nSpansion, Inc., 507 F. App\u2019x 125, 128 (3d Cir. 2012) \n(\u201cThe rule seeks \u2018to strike a proper balance between \nthe conflicting principles that litigation must be \nbrought to an end and that justice must be done.\u2019\u201d) (ci-\ntation omitted); Blue Diamond Coal Co. v. Trs. of the \nUMWA Combined Benefit Fund, 249 F.3d 519, 529 \n(6th Cir. 2001) (same); People for the Ethical Treat-\nment of Animals v. United States HHS, 901 F.3d 343, \n354-55 (D.C.

Miller & M.K. \nKane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2851 (2d ed. \n1995) (same). \nThe Eighth Circuit has held that district courts re-\nviewing post-judgment motions to amend under Rule \n59(e) or Rule 60(b) \u2018\u201cmay not ignore the Rule 15(a)(2) \nconsiderations that favor affording parties an oppor-\ntunity to test their claims on the merits . . . .\u2019\u201d Mask of \nKa-Nefer-Nefer, 752 F.3d at 743 (quoting United \nStates ex rel. Roop v. Hypoguard USA, Inc., 559 F.3d \n818, 823-24 (8th Cir. 2009)). Indeed, Moore\u2019s Federal \nPractice specifically notes that \u201c[t]he hybrid approach \nof the Second and Eighth Circuits strikes the correct \nbalance: it protects the strong interest in finality of \njudgments and the expeditious termination of litiga-\ntion, while allowing postjudgment amendment of \npleadings in a particular case if justice requires.\u201d 12 \nMoore\u2019s Federal Practice - Civil \u00a7 59.30. For that prop-\nosition, Moore\u2019s relies on two Rule 60(b)(6) cases\u2014Wil-\nliams and Mask of Ka-Nefer-Nefer. Id., \u00a7 59.30 n.9.1.3, \nn.9.1.4. \nThe Seventh Circuit gives even greater weight to \nRule 15 interests when the district court has entered \njudgment at the same time it dismisses a complaint: \nBecause Rules 59(e) and 60(b) are reserved for \nextraordinary cases, the Girl Scouts urge us to \napply a more demanding standard to post-judg-\nment motions to amend than we do to motions \nto amend filed prior to the entry of judgment. \n \n4  \nThe same is true for Rule 59(e), in which \u201c[t]he court must \nstrike the proper balance between two competing imperatives: (1) \nfinality, and (2) the need to render just decisions on the basis of \nall the facts.\u201d Edward H. Bohlin Co. v. Banning Co., 6 F.3d 350, \n355 (5th Cir. 1993). \n\n \n \n \n \n \n31 \n \nBut the extraordinary nature of these remedies \ndoes not mean that a different standard ap-\nplies\u2014at least when judgment was entered at \nthe same time the case was first dismissed. \nWhen the district court has taken the unusual \nstep of entering judgment at the same time it \ndismisses the complaint, the court need not find \nother extraordinary circumstances and must \nstill apply the liberal standard for amending \npleadings under Rule 15(a). \nRunnion v. Girl Scouts of Greater Chi. & Nw. Ind., 786 \nF.3d 510, 521 (7th Cir. 2015). See also NewSpin \nSports, Ltd. Liab. Co. v. Arrow Elecs., Inc., 910 F.3d \n293, 310 (7th Cir. 2018) (same). \nBLOM attempts to draw a distinction between \npost-judgment analyses under \u201cRules 59(e) and 60(b),\u201d \nrelying on Daulatzai v. Maryland, 97 F.4th 166 (4th \nCir. 2024). Pet.Br.34-35. But Daulatzai only held that \nunder Rule 59(e), a court should solely \u201capply the more \nspecific standard of Rule 15(a),\u201d and \u201cneed not concern \nitself\u201d with Rule 59(e)\u2019s other standards. 97 F.4th at \n177 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \nSee also Rosenzweig v. Azurix Corp., 332 F.3d 854, 864 \n(5th Cir. 2003) (\u201cthis Court has held that, under these \ncircumstances, the considerations for a Rule 59(e) mo-\ntion are governed by Rule 15(a)\u201d); Jang v. Bos. Sci. \nScimed, Inc., 729 F.3d 357, 368 (3d Cir. 2013) (\u201c[w]here \na timely motion to amend judgment is filed under Rule \n59(e), the Rule 15 and 59 inquiries turn on the same \nfactors.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omit-\nted); Allen v. Walmart Stores, L.L.C., 907 F.3d 170, \n184 (5th Cir. 2018) (same).5 Daulatzai unremarkably \n \n5  \nBLOM relies heavily on Banister v. Davis, 590 U.S. 504 \n(2020), but that case deals with what types of vacatur motions \ncount as a successive habeas application. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n32 \n \nheld that \u201cto obtain relief from a final judgment under \nRule 60(b), one of the six grounds enumerated must be \nsatisfied,\u201d including finding \u201cextraordinary circum-\nstances\u201d under Rule 60(b)(6). 97 F.4th at 178. The \nplaintiff failed to show \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d \nthere because she had already amended twice, and her \namendment \u201cefforts were pursued in bad faith.\u201d Id. at \n170. The extraordinary circumstances requirement is \nthe same in Metzler and Mandala (and in Runnion, \nwhich did find \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d).  \nIn sum, BLOM\u2019s claim that \u201cevery one of [the Sec-\nond Circuit\u2019s] sister Circuits\u201d disagrees with it is \nsimply wrong. Pet.Br.25. A number of BLOM\u2019s own \ncases recognize the need to balance competing policies \nin Rule 60(b). For example, in Leisure Caviar, LLC v. \nUnited States Fish & Wildlife Service, the Sixth Cir-\ncuit explained that while amendment should be \u201cfreely \nallowed,\u201d \u201cwhen a Rule 15 motion comes after a judg-\nment against the plaintiff,\u201d courts \u201cmust \u2018consider[] \nthe competing interest of protecting the finality of \njudgments\u201d; that is, \u201c[i]nstead of meeting only the \nmodest requirements of Rule 15, the claimant must \nmeet the requirements for reopening a case estab-\nlished by Rules 59 or 60.\u201d 616 F.3d 612, 615-16 (6th \nCir. 2010) (citations omitted) (emphases added). Like \nin Phelps, Leisure Caviar directs courts to balance the \n\u201ccompeting\u201d policies of Rule 15 and Rule 60.  \nAnd in Nation v. DOI, the Ninth Circuit explained \nthat \u201c[a]fter judgment . . . \u2018our policy of promoting the \nfinality of judgments\u2019 somewhat displaces Rule 15\u2019s \nopenhandedness,\u201d given Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s predicate of \nextraordinary circumstances. 876 F.3d 1144, 1173 (9th \nCir. 2017) (citation omitted) (emphasis added). That \ncase affirmed denial of post-judgment leave to amend \nbecause the plaintiff had already twice amended and \n\n \n \n \n \n \n33 \n \nfailed to identify how yet another amendment could \ncure its standing problem.  \nMost of BLOM\u2019s remaining cases simply note that \na judgment must be appealed or vacated before a com-\nplaint is amended or that Rule 15(a) does not alone \nprovide the analytical basis for vacatur\u2014but none dis-\npute that the Rule 15 principles could inform the ex-\nceptional circumstances analysis. See Rosenzweig, 332 \nF.3d at 864 (explaining that post-judgment amend-\nment requires appeal or vacatur); In re Ferro Corp. \nDerivative Litig., 511 F.3d 611, 624 (6th Cir. 2008) \n(same); Helm v. Resolution Tr. Corp., 84 F.3d 874, 879 \n(7th Cir. 1996) (same); Bldg. Indus. Ass\u2019n v. Norton, \n247 F.3d 1241, 1245 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (same); Boyd v. \nSecretary, 114 F.4th 1232, 1237 (11th Cir. 2024) \n(same). Indeed, in a case BLOM cites for the proposi-\ntion that \u201cthere is no pending complaint to amend\u201d \nonce \u201cthe action has been dismissed\u201d with prejudice, \nthe opinion noted that courts still apply \u201cRule 15 \nstandards\u201d to such vacatur motions. Calvary Christian \nCenter v. City of Fredericksburg, 710 F.3d 536, 540 \n(4th Cir. 2013). \nTo the extent that any of BLOM\u2019s cases can be read \nto suggest that Rule 15(a)\u2019s preference for determining \ncases on their merits plays no role in motions for post-\njudgment amendment, they are out of step with the \nother circuits. BLOM quotes Garrett v. Wexford \nHealth as holding that under Rule 60(b), \u201c[t]he permis-\nsive policy favoring amendment under Rule 15 was \nsimply not relevant.\u201d 938 F.3d 69, 86 (3d Cir. 2019). \nBut that case cited and relied on Leisure Caviar, 616 \nF.3d at 615-16, which requires courts to weigh the \n\u201ccompeting interests\u201d of Rules 15 and 60. The starker \nlanguage in Garrett was understandable as the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n34 \n \nplaintiff had already amended his complaint four \ntimes, clearly exhausting the policy of liberal amend-\nment.  \nUnsurprisingly, BLOM has selected cases where \nplaintiffs have thoroughly exhausted any chance to \namend. As noted above, Daulatzai involved a motion \nto file a fourth complaint, \u201cpursued in bad faith.\u201d 97 \nF.4th at 170. In James v. Watt, 716 F.2d 71, 77 (1st \nCir. 1983), the delay in amendment was \u201cstrategic.\u201d In \nIn re Ferro, the plaintiff did not have an actual amend-\nment in mind and needed discovery. 511 F.3d at 624. \nSee also Helm, 84 F.3d at 879 (\u201cinexcusable attorney \nnegligence\u201d); UMB Bank, N.A. v. Guerin, 89 F.4th \n1047, 1057-58 (8th Cir. 2024) (proposed second \namended complaint \u201crepeats . . . scandalous, logically \nirrelevant material\u201d and was futile) (internal quota-\ntion marks and citations omitted); Nation, 876 F.3d at \n1174 (plaintiff \u201camended its complaint twice before\u201d \ndismissal).  \nB. Rule 60(b)\u2019s Balancing Means Ensuring \nParties Have a Meaningful Opportunity \nto Amend Pleadings at Least Once, \nWhich Courts Broadly Support. \nIn the Second Circuit, the practical effect of the bal-\nancing inquiry for post-judgment motions to amend is \nfar less dramatic than BLOM suggests: \u201cIn the post-\njudgment context, we have indeed given \u2018due regard\u2019 \nto \u2018the liberal spirit of Rule 15\u2019 by ensuring plaintiffs \nat least one opportunity to replead.\u201d Metzler, 970 F.3d \nat 146 (quoting Williams, 659 F.3d at 213-14). See also \nMandala, 88 F.4th at 362 (same). If the plaintiff has \nhad a meaningful chance to amend, dismissal is no \nlonger extraordinary:  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n35 \n \nIn most if not all Second Circuit cases denying \npost-judgment leave to replead, the plaintiff \nhad already taken at least one shot at amend-\nment. This makes sense: when a plaintiff al-\nready had multiple chances to state a claim, \nthere is little risk of manifest injustice in deny-\ning yet another go. \nId. (citations omitted). \nBut a chance to state a claim is only meaningful if \nthe claimant has been fairly instructed in the correct \nlegal standard, either by a ruling of the district court \nor by clear precedent. Such a ruling identifies actual \nand remediable defects in the complaint, if any. See, \ne.g., United States ex rel. Customs Fraud Investiga-\ntions, LLC v. Victaulic Co., 839 F.3d 242, 250 (3d Cir. \n2016) (observing that without a ruling, \u201ca plaintiff is \nunlikely to know whether his complaint is actually de-\nficient\u2014and in need of revision\u201d); Tate v. SCR Med. \nTransp., 809 F.3d 343, 346 (7th Cir. 2015) (\u201cthe court \nshould grant leave to amend after dismissal of the first \ncomplaint \u2018unless it is certain from the face of the com-\nplaint that any amendment would be futile or other-\nwise unwarranted\u2019\u201d) (citation omitted); United States \nex rel. Lee v. Corinthian Colls., 655 F.3d 984, 998 (9th \nCir. 2011) (\u201c[plaintiffs] should have at least one oppor-\ntunity to add any such facts to the Complaint\u201d); Fire-\nstone v. Firestone, 76 F.3d 1205, 1208 (D.C. Cir. 1996) \n(similar). The Second Circuit noted that it is an \u201cim-\npropriety\u201d to deny amendment \u201cwithout the benefit of \na ruling,\u201d as that presents plaintiffs with a \u201cHobson\u2019s \nchoice: agree to cure deficiencies not yet fully briefed \nand decided or forfeit the opportunity to replead.\u201d Lo-\nreley Fin. (Jersey) No. 3 Ltd. v. Wells Fargo Sec., LLC, \n797 F.3d 160, 190 (2d Cir. 2015). \n\n \n \n \n \n \n36 \n \nOrdinarily, entering judgment dismissing a case \nwithout the opportunity to amend is an abuse of dis-\ncretion. See supra 30-31 (quoting Runnion, 786 F.3d at \n521). See also Jack v. Evonik Corp., 79 F.4th 547, 565 \n(5th Cir. 2023) (\u201cPlaintiffs should usually be able to \namend at least once, because \u2018fairness requires\u2019 it.\u201d) \n(citation omitted). In such case, \u201c[t]he district court left \nthe plaintiff with little recourse but to file a motion \nunder Rules 59(e) and 60(b) . . . .\u201d Foster v. DeLuca, \n545 F.3d 582, 584 (7th Cir. 2008).  \nIn fact, Plaintiffs\u2019 motion here would have come un-\nder Rule 59(e), which BLOM\u2019s cases suggest are eval-\nuated under Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal standards only, see \nsupra 31-32\u2014if not for the necessity of appealing the \ndistrict court\u2019s erroneous and essentially impossible \npleading standards first. See Mask of Ka-Nefer-Nefer, \n752 F.3d at 743 (explaining that appealing is \u201cthe \nproper recourse\u201d where a dismissal decision is wrong). \nAs the Seventh Circuit explained, \u201ca plaintiff who re-\nceives a Rule 12(b)(6) motion and who has good reason \nto think the complaint is sufficient may also choose to \nstand on the complaint and insist on a decision with-\nout losing the benefit of the well-established liberal \nstandard for amendment with leave of court under \nRule 15(a)(2).\u201d Runnion, 786 F.3d at 523. \nOf course, that entailed a risk\u2014Plaintiffs could \nhave been wrong on appeal. If the Second Circuit had \naffirmed the district court\u2019s reasoning (and not just \noutcome), that would not be an \u201cexceptional circum-\nstance\u201d\u2014that happens routinely and when it does, a \nplaintiff may have made a \u201cfree, calculated, [and] de-\nliberate choice\u201d not to take advantage of any prior op-\nportunities to amend. The circuit\u2019s affirmance on other \ngrounds here was thus fortuitous for BLOM\u2014but that \n\n \n \n \n \n \n37 \n \ndoes not justify elevating finality over the interests of \njustice. \nThis is why BLOM is compelled to argue that the \nSecond Circuit really affirmed dismissal of the case on \nthe same \u201cgrounds\u201d the district court used. Pet.Br.40. \nBut the district court acknowledged its dismissal was \nonly affirmed \u201con other grounds.\u201d Pet.App.10. The Sec-\nond Circuit\u2019s ground for affirmance involved one of the \nsame elements (knowledge), but for a fundamentally \ndifferent reason: the (original and still only) complaint \nrelied too much on \u201cpublicly available evidence\u201d rather \nthan \u201cpublic sources\u201d of information identifying \nBLOM\u2019s customers as Hamas-affiliated entities, and \nits allegation of the latter was too \u201climited.\u201d \nPet.App.51. \nThat the pleading standard was clarified on appeal \nis grounds to permit amendment, not deny it. For ex-\nample, in Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., \nthis Court explained that \u201c[w]hile we reject the Sev-\nenth Circuit\u2019s approach . . . we do not decide whether, \nunder the standard we have described . . . the Share-\nholders\u2019 allegations\u201d are sufficient. Because the lower \ncourts lacked \u201cthe opportunity to consider the matter \nin light of the prescriptions we announce today,\u201d the \nCourt vacated judgment \u201cso that the case may be reex-\namined in accord with our construction . . . .\u201d 551 U.S. \n308, 329 (2007). And after clarifying the Rule 8 plead-\ning standard in Ashcroft v. Iqbal, this Court ordered \nthat \u201c[t]he Court of Appeals should decide in the first \ninstance whether to remand to the District Court so \nthat respondent can seek leave to amend his deficient \ncomplaint.\u201d 556 U.S. 662, 687 (2009).

Co., 277 F.2d 694, 697 (6th Cir. 1960) \n(where \u201cthe views which we have expressed give the \ncase a somewhat different aspect than it had under the \ntrial court\u2019s ruling,\u201d amendment is appropriate).  \nAfter the Second Circuit affirmed dismissal on \nother grounds in Honickman II, it left Plaintiffs the \nchoice of whether to move for post-judgment leave to \namend, if they thought they had the allegations to do \nso. But as is clear from the subsequent summary order \nbelow remanding the case for further consideration, \nthat affirmance was not intended to preclude Plain-\ntiffs from seeking an opportunity to amend.  \nII. \nThe Second Circuit Did Not Find Waiver, \nand Thus Did Not Alter the Vacatur Stand-\nard in Its Summary Order \nBLOM\u2019s argument hangs on the straw man that \nthe Second Circuit agreed that Plaintiffs \u201cconsistently \nand consciously rejected numerous invitations and op-\nportunities to amend,\u201d but nevertheless \u201cdirected dis-\ntrict courts to override and rescue parties from their \n\u2018free, calculated, [and] deliberate choices.\u2019\u201d Pet.Br.28-\n29 (citations omitted). Although BLOM pressed this \nargument to the circuit below, see BLOM Brief, No. 22-\n1039, Dkt. No. 42, at 1-2, 41-43, the circuit did not find \nany such waiver. To the contrary, it found that the dis-\ntrict court applied a \u201cwrong standard\u201d that was un-\nmeetable. As Judge Wesley asked BLOM\u2019s counsel \nduring the oral argument below, \u201cWhat are [Plaintiffs] \nsupposed to do? They know they can\u2019t amend [to] \n. . . meet\u201d the standard BLOM urged and the district \ncourt adopted. Notably, BLOM does not challenge the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n39 \n \nSecond Circuit\u2019s findings as to waiver in its question \npresented here. \nNevertheless, BLOM attempts to muster evidence \nof occasions when Plaintiffs forfeited opportunities to \namend. The first two \u201copportunities\u201d were the district \ncourt\u2019s invitations to amend before issuing its dismis-\nsal decision. But these opportunities were not mean-\ningful because they offered only to amend in conform-\nity with the incorrect legal standards BLOM urged, \ngiving Plaintiffs no notice of defects under the correct \nlegal standard. See, e.g., Bryant v. Dupree, 252 F.3d \n1161, 1164 (11th Cir. 2001) (\u201cit cannot be said that the \nplaintiffs failed to correct defects of which they had no-\ntice\u201d) (emphasis added). There is no forfeiture where \n\u201cDefendants did not [identify] below\u201d and \u201cthe district \ncourt itself did not rely on the deficiencies we have \nidentified in dismissing\u201d a plaintiff\u2019s claims\u2014espe-\ncially where \u201cthe district court\u2019s reasoning meant that \nno such amendments would remedy the defects that \nthe district court perceived.\u201d Charles Schwab Corp. v. \nBank of Am. Corp., 883 F.3d 68, 89-90 (2d Cir. 2018).  \nAgain, even the district court here acknowledged \nthat its dismissal decision was only affirmed \u201con other \ngrounds.\u201d Pet.App.10. BLOM notes that Plaintiffs \ncould have added some useful additional allegations in \ntheir proposed amended complaint before appealing, \nbut it would have been futile to do so given that Plain-\ntiffs would still have failed to meet each of the district \ncourt\u2019s (erroneous) standards.  \nIndeed, if declining these pre-judgment \u201copportuni-\nties\u201d to amend constituted waiver, litigants would be \ncompelled to file serial (futile) amendments and re-\nbrief Rule 12(b) motions simply to preserve their \nrights to amend post-appeal, which would hardly im-\nprove the efficiency of the lower federal courts or lead \n\n \n \n \n \n \n40 \n \nto more equitable outcomes. Likewise, a rule that dis-\nincentives bringing valid cases \u201cwhere the law [i]s re-\nally recasting itself\u201d in the circuit courts, as Judge \nWesley observed it was here, Oral Arg. at 13:23-38, \ndoes not promote the interests of justice. \nBLOM faults Plaintiffs for not moving for vacatur-\nfor-amendment instead of appealing, or not appealing \nthe with-prejudice nature of the dismissal. Pet.Br.11. \nPlaintiffs did not seek vacatur before appealing be-\ncause there is \u201cno reason\u201d to \u201cfile a post-judgment mo-\ntion seeking leave to amend\u201d where \u201cthe district \ncourt\u2019s reasoning meant that no such amendments \nwould remedy the defects that the district court per-\nceived.\u201d Charles Schwab, 883 F.3d at 90. Again, \u201cthe \nproper recourse when [a party] disagreed with the dis-\ntrict court\u2019s interpretation of the . . . statute was a di-\nrect appeal, not a Rule 60(b) motion.\u201d Mask of Ka-\nNefer-Nefer, 752 F.3d at 743. And Plaintiffs did not \nappeal the \u201cwith-prejudice\u201d component of the dismis-\nsal decision because leave to amend would not have \naltered the result without the circuit first correcting \nthe district court\u2019s legal errors.  \nFinally, BLOM also faults Plaintiffs for not asking \nthe circuit court for leave to amend in their post-argu-\nment supplemental brief in Honickman II. Pet.Br.11. \nThough asking the circuit for leave to amend is per-\nmissible, in the Second Circuit, post-judgment leave to \namend is generally a decision for the district court to \nmake \u201cin the first instance.\u201d Iqbal v. Ashcroft, 574 F.3d \n820, 822 (2d Cir. 2009).6 The circuit court\u2019s job is to \n \n6  \nBLOM also faults Plaintiffs for \u201cnot seek[ing] rehearing,\u201d \nPet.Br.12, but in the Mandala dissent BLOM relies on, Judge Sul-\nlivan criticized precisely that: \u201c[r]ather than seek vacatur and \nleave to amend\u201d after the first appeal, \u201cPlaintiffs instead opted to \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n41 \n \nassess the district court\u2019s ruling\u2014it goes without say-\ning that if a viable amendment is necessary, plaintiffs \nwill want to make it. The summary order demon-\nstrates that the circuit court did not find a need for \nPlaintiffs to have requested leave to amend from the \nfirst panel (Judge Wesley was on both unanimous pan-\nels). \nIII. \nThe Balancing Inquiry Does Not Conflict \nwith the Text of Any of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure. \nBLOM argues that the Second Circuit\u2019s precedent \nconflicts with the plain text of Rule 15(a) and Rule \n60(b). To do so, it erroneously construes the Second \nCircuit\u2019s basis for remand as \u201callow[ing] plaintiffs to \nleapfrog over \u2018Rule 60(b)\u2019s finality gauntlet\u2019 to the \nsanctuary of \u2018Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal repleading policy.\u2019\u201d \nPet.Br.30. Again, the Second Circuit directs district \ncourts to balance Rule 60(b)\u2019s finality and Rule 15(a)\u2019s \nliberality \u201cin tandem,\u201d Pet.App.7; it does not permit \n\u201cleapfrogging.\u201d See Meltzer, 970 F.3d at 146 (finding \nthe \u201cargument that the [post-judgment] motion is gov-\nerned solely by the legal standard applicable to Rule \n15(a)(2) motions . . . without merit.\u201d). \nTo establish a textual conflict, BLOM argues that \nRule 15(a) \u201capplies only to \u2018Amendments Before \nTrial,\u2019\u201d and \u201c[i]t is in that setting . . . that the Rules \nencourage courts to \u2018freely give leave\u2019 to amend.\u201d \nPet.Br.30. Thus, BLOM suggests, Rule 15\u2019s preference \n \nfile a petition for rehearing en banc\u2014a strategic choice that \nplainly undermines any argument that some aspect of the district \ncourt\u2019s order was an \u2018extraordinary circumstance\u2019 preventing \nPlaintiffs from pursuing their claims.\u201d 88 F.4th at 368. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n42 \n \nfor deciding cases on their merits is entirely extin-\nguished at judgment.  \nBut Rule 15 contemplates two stages of amend-\nment\u2014before trial and during or after trial. Both in-\nvolve \u201cfreely\u201d giving leave to amend, under certain cir-\ncumstances which depend on trial, not judgment. See \nRule 15(a)(2), Rule 15(b)(1). The rule has no higher \nstandard. \nIndeed, \n\u201c\u2018[a]mendments \nunder \n[Rule \n15(a)(2)] may be made at any stage of the litigation.\u2019 \nGranting leave to amend after summary judgment is \nthus allowed at the discretion of the trial court.\u201d Ngu-\nyen v. United States, 792 F.2d 1500, 1502 (9th Cir. \n1986) (quoting 6 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Prac-\ntice and Procedure \u00a7 1484 (1971)). See also Dussouy v. \nGulf Coast Inv. Corp., 660 F.2d 594, 598 (5th Cir. \n1981) (applying Rule 15 and noting that \u201c[i]nstances \nabound in which appellate courts on review have re-\nquired that leave to amend be granted after dismissal \nor entry of judgment\u201d). \nObviously, this case was not dismissed after trial\u2014\nit was dismissed following an initial Rule 12(b)(6) mo-\ntion, before Plaintiffs had the opportunity to try to \ncure any actual defects in their complaint. That is pre-\ncisely the context that Rule 15(a) squarely addresses. \nEntering judgment does not eliminate Rule 15(a)\u2019s \npreference for \u201cresolving disputes on their merits.\u201d \nKrupski, 560 U.S. at 550. \nBLOM argues that Rule 15(a) \u201cdoes not provide a \nmechanism for amending pleadings after dismissal,\u201d \nPet.Br.30, but that is likewise irrelevant. To the extent \nRule 60(b)(6) provides the \u201cmechanism,\u201d it is an \u201cex-\nception to finality\u201d for \u201cany reason that justifies relief.\u201d \nGranting leave to amend \u201cwhen justice so requires,\u201d as \nRule 15(a) commands, presumably informs the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n43 \n \nreasons that \u201cjustify relief\u201d under Rule 60(b)(6)\u2014in-\ncluding providing an opportunity to amend at least \nonce.7  \nBLOM asserts that the Second Circuit\u2019s \u201cbalancing \ntest\u201d conflicts with the rest of Rule 60(b) because it \nwould permit plaintiffs to \u201cevade those explicit time \nlimitations in\u201d Rule 60(b)(1) (relief given mistake or \nexcusable neglect) and Rule 60(b)(2) (relief given new \nevidence). Pet.Br.31-33. But the Second Circuit has \nnever suggested that vacatur and amendment are per-\nmissible where a complaint failed due to counsel\u2019s mis-\ntake or where a plaintiff simply wants to present new \nevidence over a year after judgment. Instead, a district \ncourt\u2019s failure to give plaintiffs at least one meaningful \nopportunity to replead may constitute extraordinary \ncircumstances, and vacatur and amendment may be \nappropriate.  \nIn Mandala, the Second Circuit determined which \nprovision of Rule 60(b) applied before turning to the \npolicies and standards of either Rule 60(b) or Rule \n15(a): \u201cProper characterization of Plaintiffs\u2019 Rule 60(b) \nmotion is a threshold issue because, as previously ex-\nplained, [Rule 60(b)\u2019s] provisions are subject to differ-\nent filing limitations . . . .\u201d 88 F.4th at 359. The Second \nCircuit determined that Rule 60(b)(6) was the proper \nrule because \u201cinsufficient pleading is not categorically \na \u2018mistake,\u2019 and Plaintiffs\u2019 belief that their Complaint \nsatisfied the standards for pleading a disparate impact \nclaim was well-founded, even if ultimately erroneous.\u201d \nId. \n \n7  \nBLOM contends that this Court should read Rule 60(b) \nwith Rule 1, not Rule 15(a). Pet.Br.35-38. But Rule 1 does not \nnegate Rule 15\u2014to the extent Rule 1 provides any guidance here, \nit is its command to secure the \u201cjust\u201d outcome. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n44 \n \nNor does the decision below conflict with Rule \n60(b)(2), which only permits vacatur to introduce (1) \nnewly discovered evidence (2) within a year of judg-\nment. The Second Circuit does not permit post-judg-\nment amendments \u201cbased on previously omitted alle-\ngations,\u201d as BLOM asserts (or evidence discovered \nover a year after judgment). Pet.Br.33. In fact, Metzler \nrejected an attempt to circumvent Rule 60(b)(2)\u2019s \n\u201cnewly discovered evidence standard.\u201d 970 F.3d at 146. \nThat case still required a showing of extraordinary cir-\ncumstances under Rule 60(b)(6). BLOM points out \nthat movants might introduce allegations they could \nhave presented before, Pet.Br.33, but Rule 60(b) gives \nreasons for vacating a judgment\u2014it does not limit \nwhat a party can include in an amended pleading once \nvacatur and leave to amend are granted. \nTo be clear, BLOM no longer appears to contest \nthat Rule 60(b)(6) applies in this case. The district \ncourt itself found that Rule 60(b)(6) applied here, not-\ning that \u201cnone of [the other provisions] are applicable\u201d \nto Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for vacatur. Pet.App.12. BLOM \ndid nevertheless argue to the panel below that Rule \n60(b)(1) applied, but the circuit did not accept the ar-\ngument, assessing the case under Rule 60(b)(6). See \nPet.App.6-7. BLOM did not challenge the district \ncourt\u2019s or circuit court\u2019s application of Rule 60(b)(6) in \nits petition for certiorari or in their merits brief to this \nCourt. \nIV. \nExtraordinary Circumstances Are Present \nHere Because After Honickman II Clarified \nthe Previously \u201cAmbigu[ous]\u201d Legal Stand-\nards, Plaintiffs Were Denied Any Oppor-\ntunity to Meet Them. \nAs this Court has explained, \u201c[i]n determining \nwhether extraordinary circumstances are present \n\n \n \n \n \n \n45 \n \n[under Rule 60(b)(6)], a court may consider a wide \nrange of factors,\u201d including \u201c\u2018the risk of injustice to the \nparties\u2019 and \u2018the risk of undermining the public\u2019s con-\nfidence in the judicial process.\u2019\u201d Buck, 580 U.S. at 123 \n(quoting Liljeberg, 486 U.S. at 864). In Mandala, the \nSecond Circuit noted several factors in that case that \nestablished exceptional circumstances for purposes of \na motion for post-judgment amendment: \n[1] Plaintiffs have yet to be afforded a single op-\nportunity to amend their pleading; [2] the orig-\ninal dismissal of the Complaint was premised \non grounds subject to reasonable, actual, and \nvigorous debate; [3] Plaintiffs diligently prose-\ncuted their case at all times; and [4] Plaintiffs\u2019 \nproposed amendments address the sole plead-\ning deficiency identified by the district court.  \n88 F.4th at 365.  \nPlaintiffs meet all of these factors here. Denying \nPlaintiffs leave to amend risks injustice, as they may \nlose their only opportunity to have this case decided on \nthe merits, as the statute of limitations has run on \ntheir claims. See LeBlanc v. Cleveland, 248 F.3d 95, \n101 (2d Cir. 2001) (finding \u201c\u2018extraordinary circum-\nstances\u2019 under Rule 60(b)(6), because [plaintiff] would \nbe left without a remedy if the motion [for vacatur and \nleave to amend] were not granted\u201d). And where the \ncase is at its earliest stage, with no discovery con-\nducted, the prejudice to BLOM is limited solely to \nbriefing a new motion to dismiss against allegations \ntailored to meet the legal standards articulated by the \nSecond Circuit and this Court in Taamneh. The poten-\ntial burden of re-briefing a motion to dismiss is already \nbuilt into Rules 15(a)(1) and (2) and is not the kind of \nprejudice that the Rule considers. See, e.g., Patton v. \nGuyer, 443 F.2d 79, 86 (10th Cir. 1971) (\u201cThere is \n\n \n \n \n \n \n46 \n \ninvariably some practical prejudice resulting from an \namendment, but this is not the test for refusal of an \namendment. . . . The defendants were not prejudiced \nin terms of preparing their defense to the amend-\nment.\u201d). \nIndeed, courts have applied more liberal standards \nto motions for post-judgment amendment at early \nstages in the litigation. For example, the Fifth Circuit \nheld that \u201cthe Rule 15 standards apply when a party \nseeks to amend a judgment that has been entered \nbased on the pleadings,\u201d but doubted whether those \nstandards would apply \u201cafter trial.\u201d S. Constructors \nGrp. v. Dynalectric Co., 2 F.3d 606, 611 (5th Cir. 1993). \nSee also Duggins v. Steak \u2018n Shake, Inc., 195 F.3d 828, \n834 (6th Cir. 1999) (holding that amendment risks sig-\nnificant prejudice \u201cafter the close of discovery\u201d); Ru-\notolo v. City of N.Y., 514 F.3d 184, 187, 192 (2d Cir. \n2008) (similar).  \nPlaintiffs have also yet to be afforded a single \nmeaningful opportunity to amend their complaint; the \nbasis for the original dismissal of the complaint was \nnot merely open to \u201cvigorous debate,\u201d Mandala, 88 \nF.4th at 365, but entirely incorrect; Plaintiffs dili-\ngently prosecuted their case, appealing and moving for \nvacatur expeditiously; and Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed amend-\nments could address the actual defects in the com-\nplaint that the Second Circuit identified.  \nBLOM argues that no extraordinary circumstances \nare present here because (1) the district court\u2019s deci-\nsion was affirmed on the same grounds it provided; (2) \nPlaintiffs waived any \u201cright\u201d to an amendment be-\ncause they did not take the district court\u2019s invitations \nto amend; (3) even if the district court was wrong, a \nclarification or change in law is not an extraordinary \ncircumstance; and (4) Plaintiffs are at \u201cfault\u201d for \n\n \n \n \n \n \n47 \n \nfailing to amend or delaying doing so. Pet.Br.39-45. \nThe first two reasons are addressed above: the dismis-\nsal decision was premised on \u201cthe wrong legal stand-\nard,\u201d and the Second Circuit did not find that Plaintiffs \n\u201cwaived\u201d any meaningful opportunities to amend.  \nBLOM asserts that \u201cmere clarification of the law is \nnot extraordinary,\u201d as it \u201cis what appellate courts do \nday in and day out\u201d\u2014and, in fact, \u201cthis Court has held \nthat even an outright change in the law does not war-\nrant relief under Rule 60(b)(6).\u201d Pet.Br.19 (citing Gon-\nzalez, 545 U.S. at 537). But in Gonzalez, the change in \nlaw was made in another case after the case under re-\nview was decided, leading this Court to remark: \u201c[i]t is \nhardly extraordinary that subsequently, after peti-\ntioner\u2019s case was no longer pending, this Court arrived \nat a different interpretation.\u201d 545 U.S. at 537. Moreo-\nver, Mr. Gonzalez failed to show sufficient diligence \nbecause he did not \u201cseek review of the District Court\u2019s \ndecision\u201d on the issue relating to his vacatur motion. \nId.  \nHere the \u201cclarification\u201d came in the same case, as a \nresult of Plaintiffs\u2019 appeal. See Charles Schwab, 883 \nF.3d at 89-90. The Second Circuit \u201cacknowledge[d] the \ndistrict court\u2019s decision came before our opinion \nin Kaplan [II] clarified the import of our earlier \nJASTA aiding-and-abetting precedents which may \nhave generated some ambiguity as to the proper \nstandard.\u201d Pet.App.40 n.11. It is manifestly unfair to \nexpect Plaintiffs to fully understand a set of legal \nstandards that were still being \u201crecast[],\u201d Oral Arg. at \n13:23-38, when the district court could not. \nBLOM argues in the alternative that if the Second \nCircuit\u2019s clarification was \u201cin line with [Plaintiffs\u2019] \nown interpretation\u201d of JASTA, Plaintiffs \u201cnever \u2018ex-\nplain[ed] why they did not allege facts sufficient to \n\n \n \n \n \n \n48 \n \nsatisfy the standard for which they were advocating.\u2019\u201d \nPet.Br.41 (quoting Pet.App.17 n.5). But while Plain-\ntiffs were indeed broadly correct about JASTA\u2019s plead-\ning standards\u2014a fact that BLOM argues somehow \ncounts against them\u2014they could not anticipate the ev-\nidentiary distinction newly articulated by the Second \nCircuit between \u201cpublicly available evidence\u201d and \n\u201cpublic sources.\u201d \nIn fact, this Court has held that even a change in \nlaw in another case can constitute extraordinary cir-\ncumstances. See Kemp v. United States, 596 U.S. 528, \n540 (2022) (noting \u201cthe availability of Rule 60(b)(6) to \nreopen a judgment in extraordinary circumstances, in-\ncluding a change in controlling law\u201d and citing cases) \n(Sotomayor, J., concurring). For example, a change in \nlaw relating to the same incident justified reversing a \nthree-year-old denial of certiorari, because \u201cthe inter-\nest in finality of litigation must yield where the inter-\nests of justice would make unfair the strict application \nof our rules\u201d\u2014another recitation of the balancing test. \nGondeck v. Pan Am. World Airways, Inc., 382 U.S. 25, \n26-28 (1965). The Tenth Circuit also found such a \nchange in law in another case an \u201cextraordinary situ-\nation justifying Rule 60(b)(6) relief.\u201d Pierce v. Cook & \nCo., 518 F.2d 720, 723-24 (10th Cir. 1975) (en banc). \nThe interests of justice and demands of fairness are \neven more pronounced when the relevant \u201cchange in \nlaw\u201d occurs in the same case.  \nPetitioner\u2019s fourth waiver argument is wrong as \nwell: unlike BLOM\u2019s cases rejecting post-judgment \namendments that were strategically delayed like \nJames and Rozensweig, Plaintiffs here are not at any \n\u201cfault\u201d and did not engage in any \u201cgamesmanship.\u201d \nPet.Br.27, 33, 36, 44. They timely appealed the district \ncourt\u2019s incorrect dismissal decision and, once \u201c[a]rmed \n\n \n \n \n \n \n49 \n \nwith [the Second Circuit\u2019s] clarifications,\u201d promptly \nmoved for vacatur and leave to amend. There was no \n\u201cundue delay\u201d\u2014although \u201cdelay alone, regardless of \nits length is not enough to bar [amendment] if the \nother party is not prejudiced.\u201d Moore v. Paducah, 790 \nF.2d 557, 560 (6th Cir. 1986) (quoting 3 Moore\u2019s Fed-\neral Practice, para. 15.08 at 15.76). As explained \nabove, BLOM would not be unduly prejudiced by vaca-\ntur and amendment here. \nCONCLUSION \nBLOM quotes extensively from Ackermann v. \nUnited States to argue that \u201c\u2018[t]here must be an end to \nlitigation someday . . . .\u201d Pet.Br.1, 29 (quoting 340 U.S. \n193, 198 (1950)). BLOM\u2019s comparison of Ackermann to \nthis case is illustrative of its arguments generally. In \nAckermann, the petitioners sought vacatur four years \nafter judgments were entered following a trial, in or-\nder to bring an extremely late appeal. This case has \nnever even entered discovery. See Dubicz v. Common-\nwealth Edison Co., 377 F.3d 787, 793 n.1 (7th Cir. \n2004) (\u201cIt is important to emphasize that this litiga-\ntion has never progressed beyond the pleadings stage. \nThis is not the case where a plaintiff seeks to amend \nits complaint after the close of discovery or on the eve \nof trial.\u201d). Plaintiffs did file a timely and necessary ap-\npeal. Dismissal here is hardly what this Court in \nAckermann meant by \u201csomeday.\u201d \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be af-\nfirmed and the case should be remanded for further \nproceedings.  \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n50 \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \n \nMichael Radine \n Counsel of Record \nGary M.

This is a massive information gain for understanding one side of the legal battle, which is essential for predicting the outcome. Therefore, the Task EIG is very high. The Design EIG is moderate because while reading the primary briefs is a known, crucial step in any SCOTUS prediction strategy, successfully executing this step and confirming its high value helps refine the agent's workflow and reinforces the importance of this data source for future cases. It's less about discovering a new strategy and more about validating a core component of an effective one.",

In this case, Respondents \ndeclined multiple invitations and opportunities to \namend their complaint.  The District Court then \ndismissed their complaint with prejudice, and the \nSecond Circuit affirmed.  Only then did Respondents \nask the District Court to vacate the judgment so they \ncould file an amended complaint that would include \npreviously available facts.  The District Court denied \nthe \nmotion \nunder \nRule \n60(b)(6)\u2019s \nwell-settled \nstandard.  But the Second Circuit reversed, based on \nan anomalous \u201cbalanc[ing]\u201d test that requires district \ncourts to heed Rule 15(a)\u2019s \u201cliberal pleading principles\u201d \nwhen addressing a Rule 60(b)(6) motion to reopen a \nfinal judgment for the purpose of filing an amended \ncomplaint. \nThe question presented is: \nWhether Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent standard applies \nto a post-judgment request to vacate for the purpose of \nfiling an amended complaint. \n \n\nii \n \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nPetitioner BLOM Bank SAL was defendant in the \nUnited States District Court for the Eastern District \nof New York and appellee in the United States Court \nof Appeals for the Second Circuit.  \nRespondents Michal Honickman, Individually and \nfor the Estate of Howard Goldstein, Eugene \nGoldstein, Lorraine Goldstein, Richard Goldstein, \nBarbara Goldstein Ingardia, Michael Goldstein, \nChana Freedman, David Goldstein, Moses Strauss, \nPhilip Strauss, Bluma Strauss, Ahron Strauss, Roisie \nEngelman, Joseph Strauss, Tzvi Weiss, Leib Weiss, \nIndividually and for the Estate of Malka Weiss, \nYitzchak Weiss, Yeruchaim Weiss, Esther Deutsch, \nMatanya Nathansen, Individually and for the Estate \nof Tehilla Nathansen, Chana Nathansen, Individually \nand for the Estate of Tehilla Nathansen, Yehudit \nNathansen, S.N., a minor, Hezekial Toporowitch, \nPearl B.

As those precedents make clear, obtaining \nrelief from a final judgment under Rule 60(b)(6) \n\u201crequires a showing of \u2018extraordinary circumstances.\u2019\u201d  \nGonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524, 536 (2005).  And \nthose circumstances must demonstrate \u201cthat the \n[moving] party is faultless.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. \nBrunswick Assocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship, 507 U.S. 380, 393 \n(1993).  After all, \u201c[t]here must be an end to litigation \nsomeday, and free, calculated, deliberate choices are \nnot to be relieved from.\u201d  Ackermann v. United States, \n340 U.S. 193, 198 (1950). \nIt could hardly be otherwise.  Our adversarial \nsystem of civil justice could not function without a \nscrupulous regard for the conclusiveness of judgments \nprofessing to settle the parties\u2019 rights.  Courts have \nrecognized that fundamental precept since the \nFounding.  Consistent with that history and tradition, \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure afford district \ncourts the power to revisit a final judgment through \nRule 60(b) only in \u201ca limited set of circumstances.\u201d  \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. at 528.  And they strictly prohibit \na party from moving for such relief more than a year \nafter judgment if that party is even \u201cpartly to blame \nfor the delay.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs., 507 U.S. at 393; see \nFed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1), (c)(1).  \nFor decades, lower courts have faithfully applied \nthese well-settled principles of judgment finality.  And \nthey have uniformly rejected attempts by plaintiffs to \navoid Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent requirements by \n\n2 \n \nappealing to Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policy.  \nIndeed, the two inquiries are entirely separate.  Rule \n15(a) applies before trial and judgment, while Rule 60 \napplies after a final judgment.  Accordingly, \u201cif a \nplaintiff seeks to reopen a case under Rule 60(b) in \norder to file an amended complaint, she must satisfy \none of the Rule 60(b) grounds\u201d and have the judgment \nset aside \u201cbefore a court may consider her motion to \namend.\u201d  Daulatzai v. Maryland, 97 F.4th 166, 178 \n(4th Cir. 2024).  As the Fourth Circuit aptly put it \nearlier this year, adopting a contrary rule would have \nplaced it \u201calone in the Nation in collapsing the Rule \n60(b) standard with the standard for Rule 15(a).\u201d  Id. \nat 177. \nBut the decision below did just that\u2014in a case \nwhere Respondents repeatedly declined to amend \ntheir complaint in the normal course.  By rejecting the \nDistrict Court\u2019s multiple invitations to amend their \ncomplaint, Respondents deliberately chose to proceed \non that complaint as pled and take their chances on a \nmotion to dismiss.  The District Court eventually \ndismissed the complaint with prejudice, and the \nSecond Circuit affirmed the dismissal after full merits \nbriefing, oral argument, and supplemental briefing.  \nAt no time during those proceedings did Respondents \nseek leave to amend.   \nThen, more than 18 months after the dismissal \nwith prejudice\u2014and after that dismissal was affirmed \non appeal\u2014Respondents filed a Rule 60(b)(6) motion \nto vacate the judgment so they could restart the \nprocess and try again with an amended complaint.  \nThe District Court rejected that effort by properly \napplying Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent standard.  It \n\n3 \n \nemphasized that Respondents had \u201cnot demonstrated \nany extraordinary circumstances\u201d and had engaged in \na \u201cseries of deliberate choices not to cure the \ndeficiencies identified in their pleading by [Petitioner] \nand th[e] Court.\u201d  Pet.App.14, 19.  The District Court \ntherefore permissibly exercised its discretion to deny \nRespondents\u2019 motion. \nThe \nSecond \nCircuit \nnevertheless \nreversed.  \nApplying an atextual balancing test adopted by a split \npanel in Mandala v. NTT Data, Inc., 88 F.4th 353 (2d \nCir. 2023), the Second Circuit held that the District \nCourt abused its discretion by failing to \u201cgive \u2018due \nregard\u2019 to \u2018both the philosophy favoring finality of \njudgments . . . and the liberal amendment policy of \nRule 15(a).\u2019\u201d  Pet.App.7 (alteration in original) \n(quoting Mandala, 88 F.4th at 361).  In the Second \nCircuit\u2019s view, district courts are \u201crequired to consider \nRule 60(b) finality and Rule 15(a) liberality in tandem\u201d \nwhen plaintiffs seek to reopen a judgment in order to \nfile an amended complaint.  Id.  It thus faulted the \nDistrict Court for analyzing Respondents\u2019 Rule 60(b) \nmotion \u201cunder only Rule 60(b)\u2019s standard.\u201d  Id.   \nThat reasoning is indefensible.  The Second \nCircuit\u2019s outlier balancing test effectively rewrites the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.  It destroys the \nfinality principles embodied in Rule 60(b).  It \nencourages wasteful and pernicious litigation tactics.  \nIt imbues uncertainty.  And it contravenes this Court\u2019s \nprecedents at every turn.  This Court should reverse. \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe District Court\u2019s opinion dismissing the case \nwith prejudice on January 14, 2020 is reported at 432 \nF.

This Court has also stressed \nthat a movant must be \u201cfaultless\u201d to obtain relief.  \nPioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. Brunswick Assocs.

In this case, Respondents \ndeclined multiple invitations and opportunities to \namend their complaint.  The District Court then \ndismissed their complaint with prejudice, and the \nSecond Circuit affirmed.  Only then did Respondents \nask the District Court to vacate the judgment so they \ncould file an amended complaint that would include \npreviously available facts.  The District Court denied \nthe \nmotion \nunder \nRule \n60(b)(6)\u2019s \nwell-settled \nstandard.  But the Second Circuit reversed, based on \nan anomalous \u201cbalanc[ing]\u201d test that requires district \ncourts to heed Rule 15(a)\u2019s \u201cliberal pleading principles\u201d \nwhen addressing a Rule 60(b)(6) motion to reopen a \nfinal judgment for the purpose of filing an amended \ncomplaint. \nThe question presented is: \nWhether Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent standard applies \nto a post-judgment request to vacate for the purpose of \nfiling an amended complaint. \n \n\nii \n \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nPetitioner BLOM Bank SAL was defendant in the \nUnited States District Court for the Eastern District \nof New York and appellee in the United States Court \nof Appeals for the Second Circuit.  \nRespondents Michal Honickman, Individually and \nfor the Estate of Howard Goldstein, Eugene \nGoldstein, Lorraine Goldstein, Richard Goldstein, \nBarbara Goldstein Ingardia, Michael Goldstein, \nChana Freedman, David Goldstein, Moses Strauss, \nPhilip Strauss, Bluma Strauss, Ahron Strauss, Roisie \nEngelman, Joseph Strauss, Tzvi Weiss, Leib Weiss, \nIndividually and for the Estate of Malka Weiss, \nYitzchak Weiss, Yeruchaim Weiss, Esther Deutsch, \nMatanya Nathansen, Individually and for the Estate \nof Tehilla Nathansen, Chana Nathansen, Individually \nand for the Estate of Tehilla Nathansen, Yehudit \nNathansen, S.N., a minor, Hezekial Toporowitch, \nPearl B.

As those precedents make clear, obtaining \nrelief from a final judgment under Rule 60(b)(6) \n\u201crequires a showing of \u2018extraordinary circumstances.\u2019\u201d  \nGonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524, 536 (2005).  And \nthose circumstances must demonstrate \u201cthat the \n[moving] party is faultless.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. \nBrunswick Assocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship, 507 U.S. 380, 393 \n(1993).  After all, \u201c[t]here must be an end to litigation \nsomeday, and free, calculated, deliberate choices are \nnot to be relieved from.\u201d  Ackermann v. United States, \n340 U.S. 193, 198 (1950). \nIt could hardly be otherwise.  Our adversarial \nsystem of civil justice could not function without a \nscrupulous regard for the conclusiveness of judgments \nprofessing to settle the parties\u2019 rights.  Courts have \nrecognized that fundamental precept since the \nFounding.  Consistent with that history and tradition, \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure afford district \ncourts the power to revisit a final judgment through \nRule 60(b) only in \u201ca limited set of circumstances.\u201d  \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. at 528.  And they strictly prohibit \na party from moving for such relief more than a year \nafter judgment if that party is even \u201cpartly to blame \nfor the delay.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs., 507 U.S. at 393; see \nFed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1), (c)(1).  \nFor decades, lower courts have faithfully applied \nthese well-settled principles of judgment finality.  And \nthey have uniformly rejected attempts by plaintiffs to \navoid Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent requirements by \n\n2 \n \nappealing to Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policy.  \nIndeed, the two inquiries are entirely separate.  Rule \n15(a) applies before trial and judgment, while Rule 60 \napplies after a final judgment.  Accordingly, \u201cif a \nplaintiff seeks to reopen a case under Rule 60(b) in \norder to file an amended complaint, she must satisfy \none of the Rule 60(b) grounds\u201d and have the judgment \nset aside \u201cbefore a court may consider her motion to \namend.\u201d  Daulatzai v. Maryland, 97 F.4th 166, 178 \n(4th Cir. 2024).  As the Fourth Circuit aptly put it \nearlier this year, adopting a contrary rule would have \nplaced it \u201calone in the Nation in collapsing the Rule \n60(b) standard with the standard for Rule 15(a).\u201d  Id. \nat 177. \nBut the decision below did just that\u2014in a case \nwhere Respondents repeatedly declined to amend \ntheir complaint in the normal course.  By rejecting the \nDistrict Court\u2019s multiple invitations to amend their \ncomplaint, Respondents deliberately chose to proceed \non that complaint as pled and take their chances on a \nmotion to dismiss.  The District Court eventually \ndismissed the complaint with prejudice, and the \nSecond Circuit affirmed the dismissal after full merits \nbriefing, oral argument, and supplemental briefing.  \nAt no time during those proceedings did Respondents \nseek leave to amend.   \nThen, more than 18 months after the dismissal \nwith prejudice\u2014and after that dismissal was affirmed \non appeal\u2014Respondents filed a Rule 60(b)(6) motion \nto vacate the judgment so they could restart the \nprocess and try again with an amended complaint.  \nThe District Court rejected that effort by properly \napplying Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent standard.  It \n\n3 \n \nemphasized that Respondents had \u201cnot demonstrated \nany extraordinary circumstances\u201d and had engaged in \na \u201cseries of deliberate choices not to cure the \ndeficiencies identified in their pleading by [Petitioner] \nand th[e] Court.\u201d  Pet.App.14, 19.  The District Court \ntherefore permissibly exercised its discretion to deny \nRespondents\u2019 motion. \nThe \nSecond \nCircuit \nnevertheless \nreversed.  \nApplying an atextual balancing test adopted by a split \npanel in Mandala v. NTT Data, Inc., 88 F.4th 353 (2d \nCir. 2023), the Second Circuit held that the District \nCourt abused its discretion by failing to \u201cgive \u2018due \nregard\u2019 to \u2018both the philosophy favoring finality of \njudgments . . . and the liberal amendment policy of \nRule 15(a).\u2019\u201d  Pet.App.7 (alteration in original) \n(quoting Mandala, 88 F.4th at 361).  In the Second \nCircuit\u2019s view, district courts are \u201crequired to consider \nRule 60(b) finality and Rule 15(a) liberality in tandem\u201d \nwhen plaintiffs seek to reopen a judgment in order to \nfile an amended complaint.  Id.  It thus faulted the \nDistrict Court for analyzing Respondents\u2019 Rule 60(b) \nmotion \u201cunder only Rule 60(b)\u2019s standard.\u201d  Id.   \nThat reasoning is indefensible.  The Second \nCircuit\u2019s outlier balancing test effectively rewrites the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.  It destroys the \nfinality principles embodied in Rule 60(b).  It \nencourages wasteful and pernicious litigation tactics.  \nIt imbues uncertainty.  And it contravenes this Court\u2019s \nprecedents at every turn.  This Court should reverse. \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe District Court\u2019s opinion dismissing the case \nwith prejudice on January 14, 2020 is reported at 432 \nF.

The petition for writ of certiorari was timely \nfiled on May 29, 2024, and granted on October 4, 2024.  \nThis Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nFEDERAL RULES INVOLVED \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) governs \nmotions for \u201cRelief from a Final Judgment.\u201d  It \nprovides five specific grounds for relief.  See Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 60(b)(1)-(5).  Rule 60(b)(6) then states that \u201cthe \ncourt may relieve a party or its legal representative \nfrom a final judgment, order, or proceeding for . . . any \nother reason that justifies relief.\u201d \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a) governs \n\u201cAmendments Before Trial.\u201d  Rule 15(a)(2) provides \nthat \u201ca party may amend its pleading only with the \nopposing party\u2019s written consent or the court\u2019s leave.  \nThe court should freely give leave when justice so \nrequires.\u201d \n\n5 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. The Initial District Court Proceedings \nRespondents filed this lawsuit on January 1, 2019, \na day before the statute of limitations expired and \nnearly sixteen years after the latest of the events in \nquestion.  JA.1; see Pub. L. No. 112-239, \u00a7 1251(c), 126 \nStat. 1632, 2017-18 (2013) (extending the ordinary \nlimitations period for certain Anti-Terrorism Act \nclaims to January 2, 2019).  Respondents are victims \nand the families of victims of terrorist attacks carried \nout by Hamas between December 1, 2001, and August \n19, 2003.  JA.7-81.  As Petitioner explained in the \nproceedings below, it categorically abhors terrorism, it \nhas no connection to Hamas, and it is not legally or \nfactually \nresponsible \nfor \nRespondents\u2019 \ninjuries.  \nJA.160-62, 168-72.1   \nThe complaint accuses Petitioner of aiding and \nabetting those attacks through a daisy chain of \nspeculation.  In particular, Respondents allege that \n \n1  Respondents have filed almost a dozen more lawsuits \nagainst other defendants in the nearly sixteen years following the \nattacks, all seeking damages for the same injuries alleged here.  \nSee Kirschenbaum v. Islamic Repub. of Iran, No. 1:03-cv-01708-\nRCL (D.D.C.); Sokolow v. Palestine Liberation Org., No. 1:04-cv-\n00397-GBD-RLE (S.D.N.Y); Linde v. Arab Bank, PLC, No. 1:04-\ncv-02799-BMC-PK (E.D.N.Y.); Wolf v. Credit Lyonnais, S.A., No. \n07-cv-00914 (E.D.N.Y.); Applebaum v. Nat\u2019l Westminster Bank, \nPLC, No. 1:07-cv-00916-DLI-RML (E.D.N.Y.); Beer v. ASSA \nCorp., No. 1:13-cv-01848-LAP (S.D.N.Y.); Singer v. Bank of \nPalestine, No. 1:19-cv-00006-ENV-RML (E.D.N.Y.); Averbach v. \nCairo Amman Bank, No. 1:19-cv-00004-GHW-KHP (S.D.N.Y.); \nMiller v. Credit Lyonnais, S.A., No. 1:19-cv-00002-DLI-RML \n(E.D.N.Y.); Miller v. Nat\u2019l Westminster Bank, PLC, 1:19-cv-00001-\nDLI-RML (E.D.N.Y.); Spetner v. Palestine Inv. Bank, No. 1:19-cv-\n00005-EK-JAM (E.D.N.Y.). \n\n6 \n \nPetitioner provided routine financial services to three \ncustomers:  Sanabil, Subul al-Khair, and Union of \nGood (together, the \u201cThree Customers\u201d).  JA.106, 116, \n120.  Though the Complaint spans 645 paragraphs, it \nsays relatively little about the Three Customers (or \nPetitioner).  See generally JA.1-122.  In fact, none of \nthe Three Customers was itself alleged to have \nengaged in acts of terrorism.  Instead, \u201cthe Three \nCustomers were alleged only to have supported \norphans in Palestinian refugee camps.\u201d  Pet.App.52 \nn.21.   \nRespondents pled their claim under the Anti-\nTerrorism Act (\u201cATA\u201d), as amended by the Justice \nAgainst Sponsors of Terrorism Act (\u201cJASTA\u201d).  JA.121-\n22.  Under the ATA, a United States national \u201cinjured \nin his or her person, property, or business by reason of \nan act of international terrorism, or his or her estate, \nsurvivors, or heirs, may sue therefor in any \nappropriate district court of the United States.\u201d  18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2333(a).  JASTA provides for secondary \nliability against \u201cany person who aids and abets, by \nknowingly providing substantial assistance, or who \nconspires with the person who committed such an act \nof international terrorism.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 2333(d)(2).   \nTo impose secondary liability, JASTA requires \u201cthat \nthe defendant consciously and culpably \u2018participated\u2019 \nin a wrongful act so as to help \u2018make it succeed.\u2019\u201d  \nTwitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, 598 U.S. 471, 493 (2023) \n(alteration adopted) (quoting Nye & Nissen v. United \nStates, 326 U.S. 613, 619 (1949)).  And \u201cJASTA further \nrestricts secondary liability by requiring that the \u2018act \nof international terrorism\u2019 be \u2018committed, planned, or \nauthorized by\u2019 a foreign terrorist organization \n\n7 \n \ndesignated as such \u2018as of the date on which such act of \ninternational terrorism was committed, planned, or \nauthorized.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 495 (quoting 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2333(d)(2)).  Thus, \u201cit is not enough\u201d that a \ndefendant has \u201cgiven substantial assistance to a \ntranscendent \u2018enterprise\u2019 separate from and floating \nabove all the actionable wrongs that constitute it.\u201d  Id.  \n\u201cRather, a defendant must have aided and abetted (by \nknowingly providing substantial assistance) another \nperson in the commission of the actionable wrong\u2014\nhere, an act of international terrorism.\u201d  Id.  \nUnder JASTA, one of the three elements for aiding-\nand-abetting liability is that \u201cthe defendant must be \ngenerally aware of his role as part of an overall illegal \nor tortious activity at the time that he provides the \nassistance.\u201d  Id. at 486 (emphasis added) (quoting \nHalberstam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472, 477 (D.C. Cir. \n1983)).  Accordingly, to state a claim, Respondents \nneeded to plausibly allege that Petitioner was aware \nof a link between the Three Customers and Hamas \u201cat \nthe time\u201d Petitioner allegedly provided services to \nthem.  Id. (citation omitted).  But they failed to do so, \neven though their complaint was filed more than \nfifteen years after the latest of the attacks.  \nPetitioner made this point clearly and repeatedly \nthroughout the proceedings below.  Before moving to \ndismiss, Petitioner submitted a three-page letter \nsummarizing the grounds for its contemplated motion, \nas required by the District Court\u2019s Individual \nPractices.  JA.142-47.  Petitioner\u2019s lead argument was \nthat the complaint did not plausibly allege the general \nawareness element necessary to state their JASTA \n\n8 \n \nclaim.  JA.144.2  This argument, in turn, relied on the \ncomplaint\u2019s failure to allege that Petitioner was aware \nof any connection between the Three Customers and \nHamas before the attacks\u2014that is, by August 19, \n2003.  JA.145.  The complaint acknowledged that the \nThree Customers \u201cengaged in actual charitable work.\u201d  \nJA.143.  They were only \u201clater linked to Hamas.\u201d  Id.   \nIn response to this letter, Respondents chose not to \namend.  See JA.148-55.  They instead stood on the \nallegations in their complaint.  See id. \nAt a pre-motion conference, the District Court \nasked Respondents\u2019 counsel: \u201cAre there any additional \nfacts you could add to the allegations that the \ndefendant is challenging here or are you comfortable \nstanding on your complaint as it is?\u201d  Pet.App.93 \n(emphasis added).  Respondents\u2019 counsel declined the \nCourt\u2019s invitation: \u201cNo, I think we are prepared to \nbrief it based on the arguments presented in the pre-\nmotion letter.\u201d  Id.  The Court then asked whether \nRespondents would seek leave to amend if the Court \ngranted \nPetitioner\u2019s \nmotion \nto \ndismiss. \n \nId.  \nRespondents\u2019 counsel unequivocally stated that they \n\u201cwould not seek leave to amend.\u201d  Pet.App.94. \nAfter the conference, the District Court issued an \norder memorializing the fact that the court \u201coffered \n[Respondents] \nan \nopportunity \nto \namend \ntheir \n \n2  Petitioner also argued that Respondents failed to plausibly \nallege the knowing provision of substantial assistance to the \nalleged terrorist activities or any facts suggesting that \nPetitioner\u2019s routine banking services directly assisted the acts \nthat caused Respondents\u2019 injuries.  JA.145-47; see also Twitter, \n598 U.S. at 506 (summarizing principles of aiding-and-abetting \nliability under JASTA). \n\n9 \n \ncomplaint\u201d to \u201cadd additional information in response \nto the arguments raised by [Petitioner],\u201d but they \n\u201cdeclined to do so and represented that they would not \nbe seeking to amend their Complaint in this regard.\u201d  \nJA.156.  Respondents stuck to that position, and they \ndid not seek leave to amend their complaint. \nA few weeks later, Petitioner moved to dismiss \nconsistent with its pre-motion letter.  JA.159.  Among \nother arguments, it reiterated that the complaint \nfailed to plausibly allege that Petitioner knew of the \nThree Customers\u2019 purported affiliation with Hamas \nbefore the alleged attacks.  JA.160-61, 174-85.  \nRespondents opposed that motion and, in doing so, \nonce again stood on their papers.  JA.197-241.  They \ndid not move to amend or ask for an opportunity to \nreplead \nshould \nthe \nDistrict \nCourt \nfind \ntheir \nallegations lacking. \nThe District Court then held oral argument.  \nPet.App.100.  There, Petitioner\u2019s counsel again \nemphasized the complaint\u2019s failure to connect the \nThree Customers to Hamas \u201cat the time of any of the \nattacks.\u201d  Pet.App.109.  \u201cAt the very most, what the \ncomplaint alleges is that BLOM provided financial \nservices to three entities, two of which were later \ndetermined by the [U.S.] government to have provided \nfinancial support to [Hamas].\u201d  Pet.App.108 (emphasis \nadded). \nThe District Court pressed Respondents\u2019 counsel \non this pleading deficiency, asking \u201c[w]here do you \nallege in your complaint that BLOM Bank knew that \nthese account holders are alter egos or are a part of, or \nthe same as [Hamas]?\u201d  Pet.App.121.  The District \nCourt then offered Respondents\u2019 counsel yet another \n\n10 \n \nopportunity to amend the complaint, specifically with \nrespect to Petitioner\u2019s alleged \u201cknowledge\u201d: \nThe Court: I do recall that you did not want an \nopportunity to try to replead . . . . And I think \nthe Second Circuit may not encourage district \ncourts to allow another round of pleading if \nthere\u2019s been a declination of an opportunity to \nreplead . . . . So everything I need to consider in \nterms of sufficiency of your pleading is going to \nbe found in the complaint that\u2019s filed in this \ncase, correct? \nMr. Radine: Yes, Your Honor.  The\u2014 \nThe Court: There are no facts that you would \nhave to offer to address some of the contentions \nof \nthe \ndefendants \nregarding \nknowledge, \nespecially? \nMr. Radine: I think we could always add \nallegations, but the\u2014we believe the complaint \ngoes far enough in saying that BLOM . . . was \ngenerally aware of its role in th[e] [il]licit \nconduct . . . . \nPet.App.124-25 (emphasis added). \nThe District Court granted Petitioner\u2019s motion to \ndismiss, holding in relevant part that Respondents \nhad not \u201cplausibly allege[d] that [Petitioner] was \ngenerally aware of any connection between the Three \nCustomers and Hamas\u201d \u201cat the time it provided \nfinancial \nservices \nto \nthe \nThree \nCustomers.\u201d  \nPet.App.73-75.   \nThe court noted that it \u201ctypically grants plaintiffs \nan opportunity to amend their complaints following \ndismissal, to address any deficiencies raised by the \n\n11 \n \nCourt\u2019s order.\u201d  Pet.App.85.  However, Respondents \nhere \u201c[did] not request leave to amend, and specifically \ndeclined the Court\u2019s offer to do so.\u201d  Id.  Accordingly, \n\u201c[i]n \nlight \nof \n[Respondents\u2019] \nrejection \nof \nthe \nopportunity to amend their pleading at the pre-motion \nconference, and the fact that they ha[d] not identified \nany additional facts they could allege which would \naddress the deficiencies in their complaint,\u201d the \nDistrict Court dismissed the complaint with prejudice.  \nPet.App.86.   \nB. Respondents\u2019 Initial Appeal to the Second \nCircuit \nRather than request leave to amend or file a Rule \n59(e) \nmotion \nfor \nreconsideration, \nRespondents \nappealed.  In that appeal, they did not challenge the \nDistrict Court\u2019s decision to dismiss without leave to \namend.  Pet.App.16 n.4.  They instead doubled down \non their argument that their existing allegations were \nenough to \u201cstate a claim to relief that is plausible on \nits face.\u201d  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) \n(citation omitted).   \nAfter oral argument, the Second Circuit held the \nappeal in abeyance pending its decision in Kaplan v. \nLebanese Canadian Bank, SAL, 999 F.3d 842 (2d Cir. \n2021).  It also ordered the parties to submit \nsupplemental briefs addressing the significance of \nthat decision.  JA.257-58.  At this point, Respondents \nhad yet another opportunity to ask the appellate court \nto remand or grant them leave to amend in light of the \nKaplan decision.  Once again, though, they did \nneither.  They instead relied on their complaint as pled \nand insisted that the allegations therein stated a \nclaim.  JA.259-81.   \n\n12 \n \nThe Second Circuit affirmed the District Court\u2019s \ndismissal because the complaint\u2019s \u201callegations [did] \nnot support an inference that [Petitioner] was aware \nof the Three Customers\u2019 ties with Hamas prior to the \nrelevant attacks.\u201d  Pet.App.49.  Respondents did not \nseek rehearing.  Nor did they belatedly request that \nthe Second Circuit modify its decision to remand and \npermit Respondents leave to amend the complaint. \nC. The Post-Judgment Proceedings \nRespondents instead returned to the District Court \nand moved to vacate the District Court\u2019s now-affirmed \njudgment under Rule 60(b)(6) so they could amend \ntheir complaint and return to square one.  JA.315-22.  \nThe District Court held a pre-motion conference, at \nwhich it ordered briefing \u201conly as to the issue of \nvacatur.\u201d  JA.509.   \nAfter briefing, the District Court held that \n\u201c[Respondents] \nhave \nnot \ndemonstrated \nany \nextraordinary circumstances warranting relief under \nRule 60(b)(6).\u201d  Pet.App.14.  It also explained that \nRespondents had not demonstrated that they would \nsuffer an \u201cextreme and undue hardship\u201d from letting \nthe judgment stand because they \u201chave had ample \nopportunity to pursue all legal avenues available to \nthem for relief.\u201d  Pet.App.15-16 (quotation marks \nomitted).  \u201cFundamentally, [Respondents] seek to \namend their complaint after declining two prior \nopportunities to do so, and after unsuccessfully \nappealing the dismissal of that complaint with \nprejudice.\u201d  Pet.App.16.  And they sought to start the \nprocess all over again on the sole basis that they \nwished to plead new facts that were previously \navailable.  Pet.App.15.  The District Court thus \n\n13 \n \ndecided, in its discretion, to leave the final judgment \nin place given Respondents\u2019 \u201cdocumented series of \ndeliberate choices not to cure the deficiencies \nidentified in their pleading by [Petitioner] and [the \nDistrict] Court.\u201d  Pet.App.19.  \nRespondents appealed again.  Petitioner defended \nthe District Court\u2019s ruling by arguing that Rule \n60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent standards governed Respondents\u2019 \nmotion, that Rule 15(a) had no role to play in that \nanalysis, and that Respondents fell far short of \ndemonstrating \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d given \ntheir many earlier refusals to seek leave to amend.  \nSee 2d Cir. Dkt. No. 42, at 37-49, 55-59.  After oral \nargument, the Second Circuit issued its decision in \nMandala, 88 F.4th 353.   \nIn Mandala, a split panel held that, when a losing \nparty seeks post-judgment relief under Rule 60(b)(6) \nto amend its complaint, a district court must balance \nRule 60(b)(6)\u2019s finality principles with Rule 15(a)(2)\u2019s \n\u201cliberal amendment policy.\u201d  Id. at 361 (quoting \nWilliams v. Citigroup Inc., 659 F.3d 208, 213 (2d Cir. \n2011) (per curiam)).  And, where a losing party has not \nyet filed an amended complaint, the Second Circuit \nheld that it is an abuse of discretion for a district court \nto deny a Rule 60(b)(6) motion based solely on the \nmovant\u2019s \u201cfailure to demonstrate adequate grounds for \nrelief under Rule 60.\u201d  Id. at 362 & n.5.  In doing so, \nthe court flipped the burden from Rule 60 movants \n(who \nnormally \nmust \nprove \nextraordinary \ncircumstances) to their opponent (to show that the \nmovant should not receive another bite at the apple).  \nAs Judge Sullivan explained in dissent, that defies \n\u201cthe principle that Rule 60(b)(6) affords litigants an \n\n14 \n \nextraordinary remedy and effectively holds that such \nrelief is available in the ordinary course.\u201d  Id. at 368 \n(Sullivan, J., dissenting).  Judge Sullivan also \nexplained that the Second Circuit\u2019s approach \u201cerode[s] \nthe finality of judgments,\u201d \u201csignificantly undermine[s] \nthe important purposes served by Rule 60(b),\u201d and \n\u201cincrease[s] the workload of busy district court judges \nwho carry the heaviest burden in our system of civil \njustice.\u201d  Id. at 369. \nThe Second Circuit then applied and reaffirmed \nMandala\u2019s balancing test in the decision below.  It held \nthat \u201cthe district court exceeded its discretion by \nbasing its ruling on an erroneous view of the law \nbecause it failed to balance Rule 60(b)\u2019s finality \nprinciples \nand \nRule \n15(a)\u2019s \nliberal \npleading \nprinciples.\u201d  Pet.App.7-8.  When presented with a \nmotion to vacate for the purposes of amendment, the \nSecond Circuit said, \u201cthe district court is required to \nconsider Rule 60(b) finality and Rule 15(a) liberality \nin tandem.\u201d  Pet.App.7.  Thus, the Second Circuit held \nthat the District Court abused its discretion because it \nanalyzed the Rule 60(b) motion here \u201cunder only Rule \n60(b)\u2019s standard.\u201d  Id. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s outlier approach contradicts \nthe text, structure, and history of the Federal Rules, \nand it violates decades of this Court\u2019s precedents.  It \njettisons Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s well-settled and exacting \n\u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d \nstandard \nfor \na \nnebulous balancing test that wrongly smuggles Rule \n15(a)\u2019s \u201cliberal pleading principles\u201d into the calculus \nfor vacating a final judgment.  The decision below \nshould therefore be reversed, and the District Court\u2019s \n\n15 \n \ndenial of Respondents\u2019 Rule 60(b)(6) motion should be \nreinstated so this case can finally come to an end. \nI.  A party seeking to set aside an affirmed \njudgment for the purpose of filing an amended \ncomplaint must first satisfy Rule 60(b)\u2019s stringent \nstandards for vacating the judgment.  That common-\nsense position has been adopted by every other Court \nof Appeals.  And the Second Circuit\u2019s contrary \nbalancing approach is fundamentally mistaken. \nA.  Rule 60(b) imposes an intentionally high hurdle \nfor relief\u2014and understandably so.  This Court has \nlong underscored the profound importance of finality \nto our civil justice system.  After all, litigants, courts, \nand the public alike all share an interest in the \nconclusiveness of judgments and the peace and repose \nthat such finality brings.  Courts since the Founding \nhave thus consistently refused to reopen matters that \nhave been litigated to final judgment\u2014except in the \nmost compelling circumstances. \nRule 60(b) is rooted in that tradition.  It codified \nmany of the narrow, common-law exceptions for relief \nfrom a final judgment, along with a catchall in Rule \n60(b)(6) for similarly extraordinary circumstances \nthat are not explicitly covered by subsections \n(1) through (5).  Rule 60(b) therefore demands a \nscrupulous regard for finality.  Indeed, this Court has \nrepeatedly emphasized that Rule 60(b)(6) requires \n\u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d to justify vacating a \nfinal judgment.  See, e.g., Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 536. \nThat is the standard that applies here.  Rule 60(b) \nprovides the exclusive mechanism for \u201cRelief from a \nFinal Judgment\u201d more than 28 days after entry.  And \nRule 15(a) has no place in that inquiry.  Instead, Rule \n\n16 \n \n15(a) is limited to \u201cAmendments Before Trial.\u201d  There \nis not even a pending complaint to amend when an \naction has been finally dismissed with prejudice.  The \nsuit is over, and the claim is extinguished by the \ndoctrine of res judicata. \nAccordingly, plaintiffs cannot reopen a final \njudgment by invoking Rule 15(a)\u2019s policies without \nfirst meeting Rule 60(b)\u2019s restrictive standards.  And \nwhere, as here, plaintiffs seek relief under Rule \n60(b)(6), \nthey \nmust \nshow \n\u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d not covered by any other provision of \nRule 60(b).  To hold otherwise would enable plaintiffs \nto sidestep Rule 60(b)\u2019s deliberately narrow grounds \nfor post-judgment relief and thwart the Rule\u2019s respect \nfor finality. \nB.  Moreover, this Court has long held that a party \nmust be \u201cfaultless\u201d to obtain relief under Rule 60(b)(6).  \nPioneer Inv. Servs., 507 U.S. at 393; see Ackermann, \n340 U.S. at 197-202.  That is because Rule 60(b)(1) \nspecifically authorizes motions for relief premised on \n\u201cmistake, \ninadvertence, \nsurprise, \nor \nexcusable \nneglect,\u201d while strictly limiting the window for \nbringing such a motion to one year after judgment.  \nRule 60(b)(6) cannot be used to circumvent those \nlimitations.  If it could, then Rule 60(b)\u2019s provision for \n\u201cexcusable neglect\u201d would become superfluous. \nNor can Rule 60(b)(6) be used to circumvent basic \nprinciples of waiver.  That has been firmly settled by \nthis Court for decades.  See Ackermann, 340 U.S. at \n197-98.  Accordingly, where a plaintiff deliberately \nwaives the right to amend its complaint in the \nordinary course, it cannot seek a mulligan post-\n\n17 \n \njudgment after that considered choice has led to a \ndismissal with prejudice. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s outlier approach nullifies \nthese foundational principles.  Rather than requiring \nthe moving party to be faultless, the Second Circuit \nhas crafted a muddled balancing test that saves \nplaintiffs from their own litigation choices.  And the \ncourt has eschewed finality even where\u2014as here\u2014the \nmoving parties repeatedly and explicitly declined to \namend their complaint before judgment.  \nC.  The Second Circuit provided no persuasive \njustification for its balancing test.   \n1. It never even attempted to ground its analysis \nin the text of the Federal Rules.  In fact, as noted \nabove, its approach is at odds with the text and context \nof both Rule 15(a) and Rule 60(b). \n2. Moreover, by diluting Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s standard \nwith Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal repleading policy, the Second \nCircuit rendered Rule 60(b) internally inconsistent in \nat least three ways.  First, its balancing test enables \nplaintiffs to evade the one-year limitations period for \nRule 60(b) motions premised on \u201cexcusable neglect,\u201d \nby compelling district courts to reopen final judgments \noutside that timeframe based on previously omitted \nallegations.  Second, it thwarts the time limits for Rule \n60(b) motions premised on \u201cmistake\u201d of law or fact that \noccurred in the initial proceedings.  Third, it allows \nparties to reopen proceedings based on factual \nallegations they could have made pre-judgment\u2014even \nthough Rule 60(b)(2) specifically limits relief based on \nnew facts to those that could not have been previously \ndiscovered through due diligence.  \n\n18 \n \n3. The Second Circuit\u2019s test finds no support in \nprecedent either.  The decision below relied on Foman \nv. Davis, 371 U.S. 178 (1962).  But Foman is \ninapposite.  That case involved a Rule 59(e) motion, \nwhile this case concerns a Rule 60(b) motion.  There is \nno reason to conflate the standards for those two rules.  \nRules 59(e) and 60(b) differ in material ways and \nimpose different standards for relief by their own \nterms.  So this Court has refused to treat Rule 59(e) \nand Rule 60(b) motions as fungible.  See Banister v. \nDavis, 590 U.S. 504, 517-21 (2020). \n4. Finally, \neven \nif \nany \ninterpretive \ndoubt \nremained, this Court must \u201cconstrue[]\u201d the Rules to \n\u201csecure \nthe \njust, \nspeedy, \nand \ninexpensive \ndetermination of every action.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 1.  Far \nfrom advancing these overarching objectives, the \nSecond Circuit\u2019s test destroys them.  It allows the \nreopening of final judgments after plaintiffs have \nwillingly induced the judiciary to render a final \njudgment (and here an appellate ruling) based on their \noperative pleadings.  It thus invites a wasteful \nfeedback loop of relitigation.  As this case shows, that \napproach is neither just nor speedy nor inexpensive.   \nAt bottom, the Second Circuit erred in collapsing \nthe Rule 15(a) and Rule 60(b) inquiries.  The two rules \npose distinct hurdles.  The former applies before final \njudgment, and the latter applies after final judgment.  \nAs a result, Respondents could not seek leave to \namend unless they first proved \u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d beyond their control that would justify \nthe reopening of the final judgment dismissing their \ncase, which had already been affirmed on appeal. \n\n19 \n \nII. Respondents came nowhere close to meeting \nthat stringent standard\u2014and the District Court \ncertainly did not abuse its discretion in so finding. \nA.  There are no extraordinary circumstances here.  \nRespondents do not dispute that their late-breaking \nallegations were previously available to them.  They \nmerely argue that the Second Circuit \u201cclarified\u201d the \npleading standard for JASTA claims in their appeal.  \nBut the Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal with \nprejudice because\u2014as the District Court recognized\u2014\nRespondents failed to plausibly allege that Petitioner \nknew of the Three Customers\u2019 supposed connection to \nHamas at the time it allegedly provided routine \nbanking services to them.  And, in all events, mere \nclarification of the law is not extraordinary.  It is what \nappellate courts do day in and day out.  Indeed, this \nCourt has held that even an outright change in the law \ndoes not warrant relief under Rule 60(b)(6).  See \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. at 537.  The District Court thus did \nnot abuse its discretion in finding a lack of \nextraordinary circumstances. \nB.  On the contrary, the District Court would have \nnecessarily abused its discretion had it granted \nRespondents\u2019 motion.  This Court has made clear that \nit is an abuse of discretion to override a party\u2019s \ndeliberate waiver.  Here, Respondents waived or \nforfeited multiple opportunities to amend their \ncomplaint.  They first explicitly rejected the District \nCourt\u2019s invitation to amend at the pre-motion \nconference, after Petitioner had already pointed out \nthe \ndeficiencies \nin \nRespondents\u2019 \npleadings.  \nRespondents again rebuffed the District Court\u2019s \ninvitation to amend at oral argument.  They declined \n\n20 \n \nto file a Rule 59(e) motion to ask the District Court for \na chance to replead after they lost.  They chose not to \nappeal the \u201cwith prejudice\u201d component of the District \nCourt\u2019s dismissal.  And they never asked the Second \nCircuit for leave to replead if the court found their \nallegations lacking\u2014not in their opening brief, not in \ntheir reply brief, not at oral argument, and not in their \nsupplemental brief.   \nRespondents were thus far from faultless in the \ndelay.  Their own deliberate choices created the \ncircumstances from which they now seek relief.  Rule \n60(b)(6) does not save them from those strategic and \n\u201cvoluntary\u201d decisions.  Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 200.  \nGiven their repeated waivers of the chance to amend, \nRespondents could not even satisfy the more forgiving \nstandard for relief under Rule 59(e). \nFor all these reasons, this Court should reverse the \ndecision below and render judgment for Petitioner. \nARGUMENT \nI. A Party Seeking To Vacate A Final Judgment \nFor Purposes Of Amendment Must First \nSatisfy Rule 60(b). \nRelying on a series of Second Circuit precedents, \nthe decision below held that the District Court abused \nits discretion by \u201crequiring Plaintiffs to successfully \nnavigate Rule 60(b)\u2019s finality gauntlet before they \ncould invoke Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal repleading policy.\u201d  \nPet.App.8.  That, however, is precisely what the \nDistrict Court was obligated to do.  The Second \nCircuit\u2019s contrary position cannot be squared with \nRule 60(b)\u2019s text, its broader context, or this Court\u2019s \nprecedents.  It has thus been unanimously rejected by \n\n21 \n \nevery other Court of Appeals.3  That overwhelming \nmajority view is correct, and the Second Circuit\u2019s \noutlier balancing test is wrong. \nA. Rule 60(b)(6) Requires a Movant to Show \n\u201cExtraordinary Circumstances.\u201d \nThis Court has long extolled the importance of \nfinality to our system of justice.  Indeed, \u201cthe very \nobject for which civil courts have been established\u201d is \n\u201cto secure the peace and repose of society by the \nsettlement \nof \nmatters \ncapable \nof \njudicial \ndetermination.\u201d  Southern Pac. R.R. Co. v. United \nStates, 168 U.S. 1, 49 (1897).  \u201c[T]he aid of judicial \ntribunals would not be invoked\u201d if \u201cconclusiveness did \nnot attend the judgments of such tribunals.\u201d  Id.  For \nthat reason, courts since the Founding have \nrecognized that only \u201ca very strong case\u201d may justify \ndisturbing \u201cthe public interest and policy to make an \nend to litigation.\u201d  Ocean Ins.

Farrand ed., 1807). \nThat understanding persisted up through the \nadoption of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in \n1938.  By that time, a patchwork of methods had \ndeveloped for litigants seeking relief after a court\u2019s \nentry of final judgment and the expiration of the term.  \nSee Comment, Temporal Aspects of the Finality of \nJudgments\u2014The Significance of Federal Rule 60(b), \n17 U. Chi. L. Rev. 664, 664-65 (1950).  But courts \nalways remained \u201ccautious in exercising their power\u201d \nto reopen settled matters.  Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. \nHartford-Empire Co., 322 U.S. 238, 244 (1944).  Relief \ncontinued to be reserved only for \u201ccertain limited \nsituations.\u201d  James Wm. Moore & Elizabeth B. A. \nRogers, Federal Relief from Civil Judgments, 55 Yale \nL.J. 623, 627 (1946). \nRule 60(b) codifies many of these \u201cwell-recognized \nand concrete exceptions to the finality principle.\u201d  \nMary Kay Kane, Relief from Federal Judgments: A \nMorass Unrelieved by a Rule, 30 Hastings L.J. 41, 43 \n(1978); see Banister, 590 U.S. at 518.  These specific \nexceptions \ninclude \n(1) \u201cmistake, \ninadvertence, \nsurprise, or excusable neglect,\u201d (2) \u201cnewly discovered \nevidence,\u201d (3) \u201cfraud,\u201d (4) a \u201cvoid\u201d judgment, or \n(5) situations where \u201cthe judgment has been satisfied, \nreleased, or discharged; it is based on an earlier \njudgment that has been reversed or vacated; or \napplying it prospectively is no longer equitable.\u201d  Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 60(b)(1)-(5).  Rule 60(b) also includes a \n\n23 \n \ncatchall provision for \u201cany other reason that justifies \nrelief.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6). \nThat final subsection\u2019s berth has been tightly \ncircumscribed.  \u201cWhen faced with a catchall phrase \nlike [Rule 60(b)(6)], courts do not necessarily afford it \nthe broadest possible construction it can bear.\u201d  \nHarrington v. Purdue Pharma L.P., 144 S. Ct. 2071, \n2082 (2024).  That is because readers \u201cgenerally \nappreciate that the catchall must be interpreted in \nlight of its surrounding context and read to \u2018embrace \nonly objects similar in nature\u2019 to the specific examples \npreceding it.\u201d  Id. (quoting Epic Sys. Corp. v. Lewis, \n584 U.S. 497, 512 (2018)); accord Hall St. Assocs., \nL.L.C. v. Mattel, Inc., 552 U.S. 576, 586 (2008). \nConsistent with that \u201cancient interpretive principle\u201d \nof ejusdem generis, Harrington, 144 S. Ct. at 2082, this \nCourt has long construed Rule 60(b)(6) to authorize \nrelief from a final judgment only in similarly \n\u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d that are not otherwise \nspecifically covered by the Rule, Ackermann, 340 U.S. \nat 199.  The Court has emphasized that stringent \nrequirement time and again in an unbroken line of \ndecisions.  See Kemp v. United States, 596 U.S. 528, \n533 (2022); Tharpe v. Sellers, 583 U.S. 33, 35 (2018) \n(per curiam); Buck v. Davis, 580 U.S. 100, 123 (2017); \nChristeson v. Roper, 574 U.S. 373, 380 (2015) (per \ncuriam); Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 535; Agostini v. Felton, \n521 U.S. 203, 239 (1997); Pioneer Inv. Servs., 507 U.S. \nat 393; Liljeberg v. Health Servs. Acquisition Corp., \n486 U.S. 847, 863 n.11, 864 (1988); Ackermann, 340 \nU.S. at 199; Klapprott v. United States, 335 U.S. 601, \n613-14 (1949).   \n\n24 \n \n\u201cThis very strict interpretation of Rule 60(b) is \nessential if the finality of judgments is to be \npreserved.\u201d  Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 535 (quoting \nLiljeberg, \n486 \nU.S. \nat \n873 \n(Rehnquist, \nC.J., \ndissenting)).  And this Court has left no room for Rule \n15\u2019s liberal amendment policy to creep into the \nequation.  For good reason:  Rule 60(b) is carefully \ncrafted to provide a mechanism only for those rare \n\u201csituations in which relief must be obtained after \njudgment,\u201d and \u201cthe broad amendment policy of Rule \n15(a) should not be construed in a manner that would \nrender [that] provision[] meaningless.\u201d  6 Wright & \nMiller, Federal Practice & Procedure \u00a7 1489 (3d ed. \n2024).  \u201cTo hold otherwise would enable the liberal \namendment policy of Rule 15(a) to be employed in a \nway that is contrary to the philosophy favoring finality \nof judgments and the expeditious termination of \nlitigation\u201d that the Rules were designed to promote.  \nTool Box, Inc. v. Ogden City Corp., 419 F.3d 1084, 1087 \n(10th Cir. 2005) (quoting 6 Wright & Miller, Federal \nPractice & Procedure \u00a7 1489 (2d ed. 1990)); see Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 1. \nThis understanding is also consistent with Rule \n15(a)\u2019s text, history, and structure.  By its terms, Rule \n15(a) provides a liberal repleading policy only \u201cbefore \ntrial.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a) (capitalization altered).  Up \nuntil that point in the litigation, courts \u201cshould freely \ngive leave\u201d to amend a complaint \u201cwhen justice so \nrequires.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2).  This policy \nfacilitates having claims \u201cdecided on [their] merits \nrather than on procedural technicalities.\u201d  6 Wright & \nMiller, supra, \u00a7 1471 (3d ed.).   \n\n25 \n \nBut that liberal pre-trial policy evaporates post-\njudgment.  After all, \u201ca trial court\u2019s final judgment \n\u2018resolves conclusively the substance of all claims, \nrights, and liabilities of all parties to an action\u2019 and \n\u2018ends the litigation on the merits\u2019 in the district court.\u201d  \nBoyd v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corrs., 114 F.4th 1232, 1237 \n(11th Cir. 2024) (citation omitted).  \u201cSo once the court \nhas entered final judgment, Rule 15(a) no longer \napplies and no amendment is possible unless the \njudgment is first set aside.\u201d  Id.  And, where the \nplaintiff seeks vacatur through Rule 60(b)(6), \n\u201cextraordinary circumstances must justify reopening.\u201d  \nKemp, 596 U.S. at 533 (quotation marks omitted).  \nOnly after making that threshold showing to vacate \nthe judgment may the plaintiff seek leave to amend \nunder Rule 15(a)\u2019s standard.  \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s contrary rule breaks from this \nCourt\u2019s precedents, the history and structure of the \nFederal Rules, and every one of its sister Circuits.  It \nabandons the \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d standard \nin favor of a nebulous \u201cbalanc[ing]\u201d inquiry that pits \nRule 60(b)(6)\u2019s protection of \u201cfinality\u201d against \u201cRule \n15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policies.\u201d  Pet.App.8.  And \nit loads the dice in that balancing test against finality, \nproviding that district courts necessarily abuse their \ndiscretion by \u201cdenying post-judgment relief\u201d based on \nthe movant\u2019s \u201cfailure to demonstrate adequate \ngrounds for relief under Rule 60.\u201d  Mandala, 88 F.4th \nat 362 & n.5. \nNot only does that defy this Court\u2019s precedent, but \nit also violates the cardinal principle that \u201c[c]ourts are \nrequired to give effect to Congress\u2019 express inclusions \nand exclusions, not disregard them.\u201d  Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of \n\n26 \n \nMfrs. v. Dep\u2019t of Def., 583 U.S. 109, 126 (2018).  In Rule \n15(a)(2), Congress adopted this Court\u2019s instruction to \n\u201cfreely give leave\u201d to amend before trial.  Fed. R. Civ. \nP. \n15(a)(2). \n \nBut \nCongress \nand \nthis \nCourt \nconspicuously chose not to do the same in Rule 60(b) \nwhen delineating the \u201cgrounds for relief from a final \njudgment.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) (capitalization \naltered).  The implication from that differing language \nis thus straightforward.  When a plaintiff seeks to \n\u201creopen a final judgment,\u201d as here, \u201cthe policy favoring \nthe finality of judgments [is] implicated,\u201d and \u201c[t]he \npermissive policy favoring amendment under Rule 15 \n[is] simply not relevant.\u201d  Garrett v. Wexford Health, \n938 F.3d 69, 86 (3d Cir. 2019) (emphasis added).  \nIndeed, \u201cthere is no pending complaint to amend\u201d once \n\u201cthe action has been dismissed\u201d with prejudice.  \nCalvary Christian Ctr. v. City of Fredericksburg, 710 \nF.3d 536, 540 (4th Cir. 2013); see also, e.g., Pe\u00f1a v. \nMattox, 84 F.3d 894, 903 (7th Cir. 1996); Fisher v. \nKadant, Inc., 589 F.3d 505, 509 (1st Cir. 2009).  The \nmatter is closed, the claim is \u201cextinguishe[d],\u201d and res \njudicata generally \u201cbar[s] a subsequent action on that \nclaim.\u201d  Cooper v. Fed. Rsrv. Bank of Richmond, 467 \nU.S. 867, 874 (1984). \nAs a result, the \u201cmore restrictive standard\u201d for \ngranting a Rule 60(b) motion \u201cmust be satisfied before \nconsideration can be given to a motion to amend.\u201d  \nDaulatzai, 97 F.4th at 179 (emphasis added).  \nOtherwise, as now-Chief Judge Sutton has explained, \nplaintiffs could \u201csidestep the narrow grounds for \nobtaining post-judgment relief\u201d under Rule 60(b), \n\u201cmake the finality of judgments an interim concept,\u201d \nand risk turning Rule 60(b) into a \u201cnullit[y].\u201d  Leisure \nCaviar, LLC v. U.S. Fish & Wildlife Serv., 616 F.3d \n\n27 \n \n612, 616 (6th Cir. 2010).  There is no good reason for \n\u201cjudgment finality\u201d to be so \u201clightly cast aside.\u201d  United \nStates v. Denedo, 556 U.S. 904, 916 (2009).   \nB. Rule 60(b)(6) Provides No Basis for Relief \nfrom a Party\u2019s Free, Calculated Choices. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s rebuke of the \u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d test suffers from another shortcoming.  \nIt \ndefies \nthe \nrequirement \nthat \nthe \nalleged \n\u201c\u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019\u201d be such \u201cthat the \n[moving] party is faultless in the delay.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. \nServs., 507 U.S. at 393 (citation omitted); see \nAckermann, 340 U.S. at 198.  Put another way:  The \nmovant must be \u201ccompletely without fault for his or \nher predicament\u201d and \u201cunable to have taken any steps \nthat would have resulted in preventing the judgment \nfrom which relief is sought.\u201d  12 James Wm. Moore et \nal., Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00a7 60.48[3][b] (3d ed. \n2024).  A party that is even \u201cpartly to blame for the \ndelay\u201d cannot obtain relief under Rule 60(b)(6).  \nPioneer Inv. Servs., 507 U.S. at 393. \nThat requirement fits neatly within the broader \ncontext of Rule 60(b).  After all, Rule 60(b)(6) \u201cis \navailable only when Rules 60(b)(1) through (b)(5) are \ninapplicable.\u201d  Kemp, 596 U.S. at 533.  That narrow, \nresidual role for the catchall clause respects the plain \nmeaning of its \u201c\u2018other reason\u2019 language\u201d and \n\u201cprevent[s] clause (6) from being used to circumvent \nthe 1-year limitations period\u201d that applies to clauses \n(1) through (3).  Liljeberg, 486 U.S. at 863 n.11; see \nFed. R. Civ. P. 60(c)(1).  One of those time-limited \ncircumstances is for \u201cexcusable neglect.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 60(b)(1).  Thus, \u201ca party who failed to take timely \naction due to \u2018excusable neglect\u2019 may not seek relief \n\n28 \n \nmore than a year after the judgment by resorting to \nsubsection (6).\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs., 507 U.S. at 393.  \nIf it could, then the \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d provision and \nits limitations would become \u201csuperfluous\u201d and \n\u201cinsignificant.\u201d  TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U.S. 19, 31 \n(2001) (citation omitted).  Such an interpretation \u201cis of \ncourse to be avoided.\u201d  Dastar Corp. v. Twentieth \nCentury Fox Film Corp., 539 U.S. 23, 35 (2003). \nSo too is any interpretation that would excuse a \nparty\u2019s voluntary waiver of a court\u2019s invitation to \namend.  The \u201cusual federal rule of waiver\u201d applies \nregardless of \u201cprejudice\u201d to the party that \u201cknowingly \nrelinquish[ed]\u201d his rights.  Morgan v. Sundance, Inc., \n596 U.S. 411, 417-19 (2022).  And this Court has made \nclear that \u201c[i]t would be \u2018an abuse of discretion\u2019\u201d to \n\u201c\u2018override a [party\u2019s] deliberative waiver.\u2019\u201d  Wood v. \nMilyard, 566 U.S. 463, 472-73 (2012) (quoting Day v. \nMcDonough, 547 U.S. 198, 202 (2006)). \nRule 60(b)(6) is no exception.  As this Court held \nlong ago, parties \u201ccannot be relieved of [their] \nchoice[s]\u201d through that mechanism simply \u201cbecause \nhindsight seems to indicate\u201d the improvidence of their \ndecisions.  Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 198.  A party\u2019s \nwaiver of the right to amend in the normal course\u2014\nlike Respondents\u2019 repeated waivers here\u2014thus cannot \njustify relief from the entry of a final judgment that \nresults from that party\u2019s \u201cconsidered choice.\u201d  Id. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s tortured approach violates \nthese basic principles of waiver.  By requiring district \ncourts to consider Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberality policy in \ntandem with Rule 60\u2019s regard for finality\u2014even when \nthe movant has consistently and consciously rejected \nnumerous invitations and opportunities to amend\u2014\n\n29 \n \nthe Second Circuit has directed district courts to \noverride and rescue parties from their \u201cfree, \ncalculated, [and] deliberate choices.\u201d  Id.  That is \nprecisely the sort of unfair and inefficient relitigation \nloop that this Court has repeatedly warned against.  \n\u201cThere must be an end to litigation someday,\u201d and a \nlitigant\u2019s strategic choices \u201care not to be relieved \nfrom.\u201d  Id. \nC. The Second Circuit\u2019s Outlier Balancing \nTest Is Untenable. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s approach cannot be squared \nwith any of this.  The decision below held that \nRespondents \nneed \nnot \nshow \n\u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d to reopen the final judgment entered \nagainst \nthem \nbecause, \nin \nits \nview, \n\u201cspecial \nconsiderations come into play\u201d when \u201cvacatur is \nsought in order to obtain leave to file an amended \ncomplaint.\u201d  Pet.App.7 (quoting Mandala, 88 F.4th at \n361).  But the court failed to root these supposedly \nspecial considerations in text, context, or precedent.  \nAnd it contradicted each of those sources of legal \nauthority along the way. \n1. The Second Circuit\u2019s Test Is Atextual. \nMost notably, the Second Circuit\u2019s balancing test is \nunmoored from the text of the Federal Rules.  This \nCourt interprets the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \nas it would any statute.  See Bus. Guides, Inc. v. \nChromatic Commc\u2019ns Enters., Inc., 498 U.S. 533, 540-\n41 (1991).  Its analysis in that interpretive enterprise \nalways \u201cbegins with the text.\u201d  Ross v. Blake, 578 U.S. \n632, 638 (2016).  Here, however, the Second Circuit \n\n30 \n \n\u201cmade no attempt to ground its analysis\u201d in the actual \nlanguage of Rule 60(b)(6).  Id. \nNor could it.  Nothing in that Rule\u2019s text compels \ndistricts courts to give \u201c\u2018due regard\u2019 to \u2018the liberal \nspirit of Rule 15\u2019\u201d after final judgment \u201cby ensuring \nplaintiffs at least one opportunity to replead.\u201d  \nMandala, 88 F.4th at 362 (quoting Metzler Inv. GmbH \nv. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., 970 F.3d 133, 146 (2d \nCir. 2020)).  Nothing in the Federal Rules\u2019 text allows \nplaintiffs to leapfrog over \u201cRule 60(b)\u2019s finality \ngauntlet\u201d to the sanctuary of \u201cRule 15(a)\u2019s liberal \nrepleading policy.\u201d  Pet.App.8.  And nothing in the text \ncalls for any exceptions to Rule 60(b)\u2019s demanding \nstandards for \u201cRelief from a Final Judgment.\u201d  Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 60(b). \nMeanwhile, the text of Rule 15(a) expressly \nindicates that it has no role to play after judgment.  \nInstead, it applies only to \u201cAmendments Before Trial.\u201d  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 15(a); see Krupski v. Costa Crociere S. p. \nA., 560 U.S. 538, 553 (2010).  It is in that setting\u2014\nbefore trial and a final judgment\u2014that the Rules \nencourage courts to \u201cfreely give leave\u201d to amend, so \nthat the relevant factual allegations and legal issues \ncan be joined and presented at trial.  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n15(a)(2).  By contrast, Rule 15(a) does not provide any \nmechanism for amending pleadings after dismissal, \nfinal judgment, and affirmance on appeal.  At that \npoint, there are no pending pleadings to amend.  And \nalterations of the final judgment are the province of \nRule 60(b). \nThe Second Circuit thus failed to heed the plain \ntext of both Rule 15(a) and Rule 60(b) when fashioning \nits balancing test.  That led it to fault the District \n\n31 \n \nCourt for evaluating Plaintiffs\u2019 Rule 60(b) motion \n\u201cunder only Rule 60(b)\u2019s standard.\u201d  Pet.App.7.  But \nthat is exactly what the District Court was supposed \nto do.  \u201cPlaintiffs must first meet the threshold \nrequirement of 60(b)(6)\u2019s extraordinary or exceptional \ncircumstances to vacate the judgment before seeking\u201d \nto amend their pleadings.  In re Ferro Corp. Deriv. \nLitig., 511 F.3d 611, 624 (6th Cir. 2008).  The structure \nand plain text of the Federal Rules both make clear \nthat failure to meet that burden forecloses relief. \n2. The Second Circuit\u2019s Test Conflicts \nwith Other Provisions of Rule 60. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s test makes even less sense \nwhen assessed within the \u201ctotal context\u201d of Rule 60.  \nPavelic & LeFlore v. Marvel Ent. Grp., 493 U.S. 120, \n123 (1989).  A Rule 60(b) motion to reopen \u201cmust be \nmade within a reasonable time\u2014and for reasons (1), \n(2), and (3) no more than a year after the entry of the \njudgment.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(c)(1).  Yet the Second \nCircuit\u2019s balancing test for Rule 60(b)(6) enables \nlitigants to evade those explicit time limitations in at \nleast three ways. \nFirst, the Second Circuit\u2019s liberal repleading policy \npermits litigants to bypass Rule 60\u2019s strict time \nlimitations for \u201cexcusable neglect.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n60(b)(1).  If a plaintiff neglects to include certain \nallegations in his complaint and that omission is \n\u201cexcusable,\u201d then he has only one year to move to \nreopen the judgment based on that oversight through \nRule 60(b)(1).  He cannot do the same through Rule \n60(b)(6), as a party cannot \u201c\u2018avail himself\u2019\u201d of that \nprovision \u201cif his motion is based on grounds specified \nin clause (1).\u201d  Liljeberg, 486 U.S. at 863 n.11 (citation \n\n32 \n \nomitted).  But the Second Circuit allows and even \nencourages plaintiffs to do precisely that, by \ncompelling district courts to reopen actions under Rule \n60(b)(6) if the plaintiffs \u201creasonably\u201d (i.e., excusably) \nneglected to include their late-breaking allegations \nbefore final judgment.  Mandala, 88 F.4th at 359, 364.4  \nRather than embrace that misguided approach, this \nCourt \nshould \n\u201cresist\u201d \nany \ninterpretation \nthat \n\u201crender[s] [Rule 60(b)] so internally inconsistent.\u201d  \nJones v. Hendrix, 599 U.S. 465, 479 (2023) (citation \nomitted). \nSecond, the Second Circuit\u2019s balancing test serves \nas an end-run around Rule 60(b)(1)\u2019s time limits for \n\u201cmistake.\u201d  In Mandala, for instance, the Court of \nAppeals held that Rule 60(b)(1) is \u201cinapplicable\u201d\u2014and \nthat \u201c\u2018the liberal spirit of Rule 15\u2019\u201d instead kicks in\u2014\nwhen a \u201cvacatur motion arises from a legal mistake\u201d \nthat leads a plaintiff into \u201cinsufficient pleading.\u201d  88 \nF.4th at 360-62 (emphasis added; citation omitted).  \nYet, there is no reason why that form of \u201clegal mistake\u201d \nwould pull a motion outside of Rule 60(b)(1)\u2019s ambit.  \nThose who drafted and adopted the Rules \u201cchose to \ninclude \u2018mistake\u2019 unqualified.\u201d  Kemp, 596 U.S. at 534.  \n\u201cWhen the Rule was adopted in 1938 and revised in \n \n4  Of course, if a plaintiff \u201cinexcusably\u201d omitted their new \nallegations, that cannot possibly provide a \u201creason that justifies \nrelief.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6) (emphasis added); see, e.g., \nInexcusable, American College Dictionary 621 (Clarence L. \nBarnhart ed., 1953) (\u201cincapable of being justified\u201d); Inexcusable, \nWebster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary 428 (6th ed. 1949) (\u201cnot \nadmitting excuse or justification\u201d).  It is therefore \u201cclear\u201d that \n\u201cinexcusable neglect\u201d similarly \u201cdoes not justify relief under Rule \n60(b)(6).\u201d  Helm v. Resolution Tr. Corp., 84 F.3d 874, 879 (7th Cir. \n1996); see Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 202; PIRS Cap., LLC v. \nWilliams, 54 F.4th 1050, 1055 (8th Cir. 2022). \n\n33 \n \n1946, \nthe \nword \n\u2018mistake\u2019 \napplied \nto \nany \n\u2018misconception,\u2019 \u2018misunderstanding,\u2019 or \u2018fault in \nopinion or judgment.\u2019\u201d  Id. (quoting Webster\u2019s New \nInternational Dictionary 1383 (1914)).  That includes \n\u201cmistakes of law\u201d made by judges and litigants alike.  \nId. at 534-35.  The Second Circuit\u2019s atextual standard \nthus clashes with Rule 60\u2019s limited availability of \nrelief for \u201cmistake\u201d as well.  That provides yet another \ncontextual strike against it. \nThird, the Second Circuit\u2019s approach overrides \nRule 60(b)(2)\u2019s restrictions for vacatur based on new \nevidence.  That provision allows parties \u201cto reopen \nproceedings\u201d based only \u201con matter which could not \nreasonably have been previously adduced\u201d\u2014and even \nthen, only if the party presents that material within a \nyear of final judgment.  INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314, \n326 (1992); see Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(2) (\u201cnewly \ndiscovered evidence that, with reasonable diligence, \ncould not have been discovered in time to move for a \nnew trial\u201d).  This rule is consistent with centuries of \nhistorical \npractice. \n \nSee, \ne.g., \nJoseph \nStory, \nCommentaries on Equity Pleadings 322 (2d ed. 1840) \n(explaining that a final judgment can be reopened \nbased only on \u201csome new matter, which hath arisen in \ntime after the decree, and not on any new proof, which \nmight have been used, when the decree was made\u201d \n(discussing the Ordinances in Chancery of Lord \nChancellor Bacon)); Purcell v. Miner, 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) \n519, 521 (1867) (same).  But, under the Second \nCircuit\u2019s regime, movants can introduce new factual \nallegations through Rule 60(b)(6), even if they could \nhave presented them before, and even if more than a \nyear has elapsed from the entry of final judgment.  See \nMandala, 88 F.4th at 365.  In this way, too, the Second \n\n34 \n \nCircuit has put Rule 60 \u201cat war with itself.\u201d  United \nStates ex rel. Polansky v. Exec. Health Res., Inc., 599 \nU.S. 419, 434 (2023) (citation omitted).  \n3. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s Test Distorts this \nCourt\u2019s Precedents. \nLeft with no support in Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s text or \ncontext, the Second Circuit tried to ground its \nstandard in Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178.  See \nMandala, 88 F.4th at 362; Pet.App.6.  But Foman did \nnot address a Rule 60(b)(6) motion.  This Court instead \nrecognized the motion there (which was filed just a day \nafter the district court\u2019s decision) \u201cas one under Rule \n59(e).\u201d  Foman, 371 U.S. at 179, 181 (emphasis added). \nAs a result, Foman is simply inapt in this setting. \nRather, the controlling precedent is Gonzalez, which \nreaffirmed that a Rule 60(b)(6) motion \u201crequires a \nshowing of \u2018extraordinary circumstances.\u2019\u201d  545 U.S. at \n536.  And there is no basis to conflate that demanding \nstandard with the one for Rule 59(e).  \u201cThe difference \nbetween the two rules . . . is material, both in scope \nand purpose, and, by their own terms, different \nstandards apply.\u201d  Daulatzai, 97 F.4th at 177. \nIndeed, \u201cRule 60(b) differs from Rule 59(e) in just \nabout every way that matters to the inquiry here.\u201d  \nBanister, 590 U.S. at 518; see Daulatzai, 97 F.4th at \n177-78.  A Rule 59(e) motion \u201cis a one-time effort to \nbring alleged errors in a just-issued decision to a \n[district] court\u2019s attention, before taking a single \nappeal.\u201d  Banister, 590 U.S. at 521; see Fed. R. Civ. P. \n59(e).  Accordingly, the time for bringing a Rule 59(e) \nmotion \u201cis short\u201428 days from entry of the judgment, \nwith no possibility of an extension.\u201d  Banister, 590 U.S. \nat 507-08.  And, because \u201c[i]t is a limited continuation \n\n35 \n \nof the original proceeding,\u201d a timely Rule 59(e) motion \nautomatically \n\u201c\u2018suspend[s] \nthe \nfinality\u2019 \nof \nany \njudgment.\u201d  Id. at 514, 521 (citation omitted); see Fed. \nR. App. P. 4(a)(4)(A)(iv).  \u201cOnly the disposition of that \nmotion restores the finality of the original judgment,\u201d \nand \nthat \ndisposition \n\u201cmerges \nwith \nthe \nprior \ndetermination, so that the reviewing court takes up \nonly one judgment\u201d on appeal.  Banister, 590 U.S. at \n508-09 (brackets and quotation marks omitted).  By \ncontrast, \u201c[a] Rule 60(b) motion\u2014often distant in time \nand scope and always giving rise to a separate \nappeal\u2014attacks an already completed judgment,\u201d and \nit \u201c\u2018does not affect the [original] judgment\u2019s finality or \nsuspend its operation.\u201d  Id. at 520-21 (second \nalteration in original) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(c)(2)).  \nA Rule 60(b) motion therefore uniquely \u201cthreaten[s] an \nalready final judgment with successive litigation.\u201d  Id. \nat 519.  Consequently, the \u201cstandard for granting a \nRule 59(e) motion\u201d is more \u201cbroad and open ended\u201d \nthan Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s strict standard for relief.  \nDaulatzai, 97 F.4th at 177.   \nThe Second Circuit failed to grasp these crucial \ndifferences.  Instead, Mandala and the decision below \nwrongly treated Rule 59(e) and Rule 60(b)(6) motions \nas fungible, and then uncritically transplanted \nFoman\u2019s more forgiving Rule 59(e) standard to \noverride the stringent requirements for Rule 60(b)(6).  \nThis Court should reject that misguided approach.  It \ndisregards Rule 60(b)\u2019s unique text and context and \nflouts this Court\u2019s Rule 60(b) precedents. \n\n36 \n \n4. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s Test Undermines \nthe Guiding Principles of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure. \nEven if there were any doubt (which there is not), \nthe Federal Rules would require this Court to resolve \nit against the Second Circuit\u2019s interpretation.  That is \nbecause the Rules state that they must be \u201cconstrued\u201d \nin the face of ambiguity to \u201csecure the just, speedy, and \ninexpensive determination of every action and \nproceeding.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 1.   \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s approach flips those guiding \nprinciples on their head.  It eschews finality, and it \nundermines confidence in the outcome of hard-fought \nlitigation.  It also enables plaintiffs to \u201cuse the court \nas a sounding board to discover holes in their \narguments, then \u2018reopen the case by amending their \ncomplaint to take account of the court\u2019s decision,\u2019\u201d even \nafter testing the complaint against a full appeal and \nrepeatedly declining earlier opportunities to amend.  \nLeisure Caviar, 616 F.3d at 616 (quoting James v. \nWatt, 716 F.2d 71, 78 (1st Cir. 1983) (Breyer, J.)).  Such \ngamesmanship will inevitably draw out litigation and \ndrive up its already high costs.   \nThis case proves the point.  The matter \u201chas been \nclosed since January 15, 2020,\u201d when Petitioner \nsecured a final judgment in its favor.  Pet.App.10.  \nPetitioner prevailed on appeal after that.  Then \nPetitioner successfully showed that Rule 60(b) \nprovided no path for reopening the final judgment.  \nRespondents\u2019 \u201cfail[ure] to satisfy the requirements of \nRule 60(b) should therefore have ended the matter.\u201d  \nDaulatzai, 97 F.4th at 179.  Yet, Respondents continue \nto seek a return to square one\u2014merely so that they \n\n37 \n \ncan plead new factual allegations that were previously \navailable to them and which they had expressly \ndeclined to plead before dismissal. \nAllowing losing litigants to thus restart the loop of \nlitigation would not promote the \u201cspeedy\u201d and \n\u201cinexpensive\u201d resolution of claims.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 1.  \nNor would it be \u201cjust.\u201d  Id.  Quite the opposite:  Like \nthe doctrine of res judicata, Rule 60(b)\u2019s demanding \nrequirements for reopening a final judgment are \nthemselves rooted in \u201cfundamental and substantial \njustice,\u201d and they are designed to further both \u201c\u2018public \npolicy and . . . private peace.\u2019\u201d  Federated Dep\u2019t Stores, \nInc. v. Moitie, 452 U.S. 394, 401 (1981) (citation \nomitted); see supra Section I.A.  They should therefore \n\u201cbe cordially regarded and enforced by the courts.\u201d  \nMoitie, 452 U.S. at 401 (citation omitted).  The \n\u201cweighty interests in finality\u201d must \u201ctrump the \ninterest in giving losing litigants access to an \nadditional\u201d round of proceedings in all but the most \nunusual case.  See San Remo Hotel, L.P. v. City & \nCounty of S.F., 545 U.S. 323, 345 (2005).  That is \nparticularly true when the movant seeks a mulligan to \nrescue himself from his \u201cfree, calculated, deliberate \nchoices.\u201d  Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 198.   \nConsistent with these fundamental tenets of civil \nprocedure, courts have long rejected belated attempts \nby plaintiffs to attack a final judgment with an \namended complaint.  See supra note 3 (collecting \ncases).  They have instead required plaintiffs to put \ntheir best foot forward before judgment or risk an end \nto their lawsuit.  And they have reserved Rule 60(b)(6) \nrelief\u2014as this Court\u2019s precedents command\u2014for only \n\n38 \n \ntruly \u201ccompelling circumstances\u201d outside the movant\u2019s \ncontrol.  James, 716 F.2d at 78 (Breyer, J.). \n*   *   * \nIn sum, Rule 15(a) \u201cgoverns amendment of \npleadings before judgment is entered; it has no \napplication after judgment is entered.\u201d  Jacobs v. \nTempur-Pedic Int\u2019l Inc., 626 F.3d 1327, 1344 (11th Cir. \n2010).  From that point, a party that seeks \u201crelief from \na final judgment\u201d must first satisfy the rigorous \ndemands of Rule 60(b).  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) \n(capitalization altered).5  And where, as here, the \nparty seeks such relief under Rule 60(b)(6), he must \n\u201cshow \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019\u201d beyond his \ncontrol that would \u201cjustify[] the reopening of a final \njudgment.\u201d  Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 535 (quoting \nAckermann, 340 U.S. at 199); see Pioneer Inv. Servs., \n507 U.S. at 393.  Only after surmounting that \nintentionally high hurdle for vacating the judgment \ncan he invoke the more liberal policies of Rule 15(a).  \nThe Second Circuit erred in holding to the contrary. \nII. Respondents Cannot Satisfy Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s \nStringent Standard. \nThis Court should reverse the decision below and \nbring an end to this litigation once and for all.  Unlike \nthe Second Circuit, the District Court applied the \ncorrect legal standard by refusing to \u201c\u2018entertain a \nmotion to amend the complaint\u2019 under Rule 15(a) \nwithout \u2018a valid basis to vacate the previously entered \njudgment\u2019 under Rule 60(b).\u201d  Pet.App.7 (quoting \nDistrict Court\u2019s decision).  It properly treated those \n \n5  Or those of Rule 59(e), if the motion is filed within 28 days \nof the entry of judgment. \n\n39 \n \nRules as posing two distinct inquiries.  And, in a \nthoughtful \nopinion \nissued \nafter \na \npre-motion \nconference and full briefing, it methodically explained \nwhy Respondents \u201chave not demonstrated any \nextraordinary circumstances warranting relief under \nRule 60(b)(6).\u201d  Pet.App.14. \nA. Respondents Have Not Demonstrated \n\u201cExtraordinary Circumstances.\u201d \nWhen a District Court applies the correct legal \nstandard, as here, \u201cRule 60(b) proceedings are subject \nto only limited and deferential appellate review.\u201d  \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. at 535.  An appellate court \u201cmay \nreview the [district court\u2019s] ruling only for abuse of \ndiscretion.\u201d  Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corrs. of Ill., 434 \nU.S. 257, 263 n.7 (1978).  And that standard affords \u201ca \nwide range of choice\u201d to the district court.  McLane Co. \nv. EEOC, 581 U.S. 72, 83 (2017) (citation omitted).  \nAppellate courts cannot \u201cinterfere with the District \nCourt\u2019s exercise of discretion unless\u201d they are left with \n\u201ca definite and firm conviction that the court \ncommitted a clear error of judgment.\u201d  Betterbox \nCommc\u2019ns, Ltd. v. BB Techs, Inc., 300 F.3d 325, 332 \n(3d Cir. 2002) (Alito, J.) (alterations adopted; citation \nomitted).  In other words, the Court must \u201cfind a \ncomplete absence of a reasonable basis and [be] \ncertain that the [District Court\u2019s] decision is wrong.\u201d  \nDavis v. Kan. Dep\u2019t of Corrs., 507 F.3d 1246, 1248 (10th \nCir. 2007) (citation omitted). \nThat is not the case here.  Far from it.  Respondents \nhave never contended \u201cthat any of their proposed new \nallegations were unavailable to them\u201d when they filed \ntheir complaint or when they repeatedly declined the \nDistrict Court\u2019s invitations to amend.  Pet.App.15.  \n\n40 \n \nThey argue only that the Second Circuit \u201cclarified\u201d the \nJASTA pleading standard in some respects in their \nprevious appeal of the District Court\u2019s dismissal.  \nBIO.2.  But that is neither correct nor relevant.   \nIt is not correct because the Second Circuit \naffirmed the dismissal on grounds that the District \nCourt had relied on\u2014namely, that Respondents\u2019 \n\u201callegations do not support an inference that BLOM \nBank was aware of the Three Customers\u2019 ties with \nHamas prior to the relevant attacks.\u201d  Pet.App.49; see \nalso Pet.App.74-75 (\u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 allegations therefore \nfail to raise above the speculative level the specter that \nBLOM was aware of a connection between the Three \nCustomers and Hamas at the time it provided \nfinancial services to the Three Customers.\u201d).  In dicta, \nthe Second Circuit disagreed with other grounds relied \non by the District Court.  But the District Court\u2019s \nindependent conclusion that Respondents failed to \ndemonstrate general awareness at the time of the \nalleged assistance\u2014as JASTA requires\u2014\u201cremain[s] \ncompletely unaffected by anything that was decided or \nsaid\u201d by the Second Circuit in this case or any other.  \nPolites v. United States, 364 U.S. 426, 436 (1960) \n(affirming denial of Rule 60(b) motion).   \nRespondents\u2019 argument is also irrelevant because, \neven if the Second Circuit had clarified its view of the \nlaw, that would not be enough to satisfy Rule 60(b)(6).  \n\u201cIntervening developments in the law by themselves \nrarely\u201d \nif \never \n\u201cconstitute \nthe \nextraordinary \ncircumstances required for relief under Rule 60(b)(6).\u201d  \nAgostini, 521 U.S. at 239; see Pet.App.14-15.  And the \ndevelopments here are by no means groundbreaking.  \nThe governing statute did not change after final \n\n41 \n \njudgment. \n \nRespondents \nmerely \nallege \na \n\u201cclarification[]\u201d of the law by the Second Circuit that \nwas in line with their own interpretation.  BIO.25.  \nThere \nis \nnothing \n\u201cextraordinary\u201d \nabout \nthat.  \nRespondents never \u201cexplain[ed] why they did not \nallege facts sufficient to satisfy the standard for which \nthey were advocating.\u201d  Pet.App.17 n.5.  And clarifying \nthe law is what appellate courts do all the time.  In \nfact, this Court has held that even a \u201cchange in the \nlaw\u201d worked by one of its decisions abrogating \npreviously controlling circuit precedent could not \njustify Rule 60(b)(6) relief.  Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 536-\n37 (emphasis added).  Such a change in decisional \ncaselaw, \nthe \nCourt \nexplained, \nis \n\u201chardly \nextraordinary.\u201d  Id. at 536.  The circumstances here \nare even less so.  \nIn short, the District Court\u2019s determination that \nRespondents failed to satisfy Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s high bar \nfor reopening a final judgment fell well within the \nrange of permissible decisions.  It was not an abuse of \ndiscretion.  It should have been upheld for that reason \nalone. \nB. Respondents Waived or Forfeited Multiple \nOpportunities to Amend Their Complaint. \nNot only did the District Court act within its \ndiscretion, but it would have abused its discretion had \nit ruled the other way.  As this Court has explained, it \nis \u201can abuse of discretion\u201d to \u201coverride a [party\u2019s] \ndeliberative waiver.\u201d  Wood, 566 U.S. at 472-73 \n(citation omitted).  And this case involves waiver many \ntimes over.  Respondents \u201cdo not contend that the \nadditional facts they now propose to allege were not \navailable\u201d to them before, and they \u201cconcede that they \n\n42 \n \ntwice declined the opportunity to amend their \nComplaint before th[e] [District] Court dismissed it.\u201d  \nPet.App.16, 18 n.6.  The District Court rightly held \nthat those repeated waivers foreclosed relief as well.  \nSee Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 198.   \nRespondents first rejected the District Court\u2019s \ninvitation to amend at the pre-motion conference.  \nPet.App.16-17.  Before that conference, Petitioner \nexplained that \u201cthe Complaint alleges nothing more \nthan that [Petitioner] provided routine banking \nservices to organizations that later were revealed to be \nconnected to Hamas.\u201d  JA.145.  \u201c[N]one of the \nallegations, if true, would establish that [Petitioner] \nwas aware of that connection at the time it provided \nthose banking services\u201d to the Three Customers.  Id.  \nAccordingly, the District Court asked Respondents\u2019 \ncounsel if there were \u201cany additional facts [they] could \nadd to the allegations\u201d to address Petitioner\u2019s \narguments.  Pet.App.93.  Respondents\u2019 counsel \n\u201cexpressly declined\u201d the invitation.  Pet.App.17.  The \nDistrict Court then asked a second time if \nRespondents \u201cwould not want to amend\u201d if the Court \n\u201cwere to grant [Petitioner\u2019s] motion.\u201d  Pet.App.93.  \nRespondents unequivocally stated that they \u201cwould \nnot seek leave to amend.\u201d  Pet.App.94.  Hence, the \nDistrict Court issued a minute entry and scheduling \norder to that effect.  JA.156. \nNotwithstanding that entry, the District Court \ngave Respondents yet another chance to amend at oral \nargument \non \nPetitioner\u2019s \nmotion \nto \ndismiss.  \nPet.App.17-18.  At the hearing, the judge explained \nthat she \u201cjust [did not] see any knowledge on the part \nof [Petitioner]\u201d alleged in the complaint.  Pet.App.118.  \n\n43 \n \nShe asked if \u201ceverything [she] need[ed] to consider in \nterms of sufficiency of [the] pleading is going to be \nfound in the complaint that\u2019s filed in this case.\u201d  \nPet.App.124.  And she asked Respondents to confirm \nthat \u201c[t]here are no facts that [Respondents] would \nhave to offer to address some of the contentions of \n[Petitioner] \nregarding \nknowledge, \nespecially.\u201d  \nPet.App.125.  In response, Respondents \u201cagain \nexpressly declined the opportunity to amend their \ncomplaint\u201d and chose to proceed on their complaint as \npled.  Pet.App.18.  That was a \u201ccalculated and \ndeliberate\u201d choice.  Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 198.  Rule \n60(b)(6) therefore \u201chas no application.\u201d  Id. at 202. \nNor did Respondents\u2019 waivers stop there.  Despite \nproceeding up to the Second Circuit, Respondents \n\u201cnever appealed the \u2018with prejudice\u2019 aspect of the \ndismissal\u201d and never argued that the District Court \nshould \nhave \ngranted \nthem \nleave \nto \nreplead.  \nPet.App.16 n.4.  They simply maintained that their \nallegations were sufficient.  The District Court \ncorrectly recognized this litigation choice as still \nanother waiver that precluded Respondents from \nseeking leave to replead if they lost on appeal.  See id. \n(citing 18A Wright & Miller, Federal Practice & \nProcedure \u00a7 4433 (3d ed. 2021) (\u201cA party who elects to \nappeal on one issue, omitting another issue on which \nit lost, is subject to issue preclusion on the issue not \nappealed.\u201d)).   \nThat failure was by itself fatal, even ignoring \nRespondents\u2019 previous waivers.  If a party\u2019s \u201creason \nasserted for [its] Rule 60(b)(6) motion could have been \naddressed on appeal from the judgment,\u201d then the \nmotion must be denied \u201cas merely an inappropriate \n\n44 \n \nsubstitute for an appeal.\u201d  Aikens v. Ingram, 652 F.3d \n496, 501 (4th Cir. 2011) (en banc).  This understanding \nthat Rule 60(b)(6) \u201ccannot be used as a substitute for \nappeal\u201d has been \u201csettled\u201d for decades.  Jean F. \nRydstrom, Construction and Application of Rule \n60(b)(6) of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 15 A.L.R. \nFed. 193, \u00a7 2[a] (2024).  And that principle makes \neminent sense.  Otherwise, parties could skirt the \nlimitations period for post-judgment motions based on \n\u201cmistake, \ninadvertence, \nsurprise, \nor \nexcusable \nneglect,\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1), as well as the \njurisdictional time limits for appealing an adverse \ndecision, see Fed. R. App. P. 4(a); Bowles v. Russell, 551 \nU.S. 205, 206 (2007). \nEach of the foregoing waivers demonstrates that \nRespondents were not \u201cfaultless in the delay.\u201d  Pioneer \nInv. Servs., 507 U.S. at 393.  That delay resulted from \ntheir own strategic decisions, each of which precludes \nrelief.  And, beyond those waivers, Respondents \nforfeited still more opportunities to seek amendment \nof their complaint.  In particular, before failing to \nappeal from the District Court\u2019s \u201cwith prejudice\u201d \nruling, they failed to file a Rule 59(e) motion \nchallenging that aspect of the District Court\u2019s \ndismissal.  And despite being invited to file \nsupplemental briefing in the Second Circuit\u2014after \nthat court issued its controlling decision in Kaplan\u2014\nRespondents still failed to request leave to amend in \nlight of that new precedent.   \nRespondents have thus come nowhere close to \nmeeting Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d \nstandard.  Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 536.  In fact, they \ncould not even satisfy Foman\u2019s more lenient standard \n\n45 \n \nfor Rule 59(e) motions.  Foman held only that a district \ncourt \nerrs \nby \n\u201coutright \nrefus[ing]\u201d \nto \npermit \namendment before appeal \u201cwithout any justifying \nreason.\u201d  371 U.S. at 182.  Here, by contrast, the \nDistrict Court provided many justifying reasons for \ndenying relief (after appellate proceedings had \nalready concluded).  It explained that Respondents \n\u201chad ample opportunity to pursue all legal avenues \navailable to them for relief,\u201d but they simply chose not \nto do so.  Pet.App.16.  They instead engaged in a \n\u201cdocumented series of deliberate choices not to cure \nthe deficiencies identified in their pleading by \n[Petitioner] and [the District] Court.\u201d  Pet.App.19.  \nThose \u201cfree, calculated, deliberate choices are not to be \nrelieved from.\u201d  Id. (quoting Ackermann, 340 U.S. at \n198).  Not only was the District Court\u2019s decision a \npermissible exercise of discretion, but it was \ndemonstrably correct. \n \n \n\n46 \n \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should reverse \nthe judgment below. \n  \n \n \n \n  Respectfully submitted, \nJONATHAN R.

Circuit courts generally hold that \nmeans providing an opportunity to amend once a ruling \nidentifies remediable defects, if any, in a pleading. Fail-\ning to provide that opportunity may constitute an \u201cex-\ntraordinary circumstance\u201d and a basis to vacate a judg-\nment under Rule 60(b)(6).  \nHere, the Second Circuit found that the district \ncourt dismissed Respondents\u2019 complaint by applying \nthe \u201cwrong legal standard\u201d for pleading an aiding and \nabetting claim (in the Second Circuit) under the Justice \nAgainst Sponsors of Terrorism Act, as well as a stand-\nard for pleading knowledge that was \u201ctoo exacting\u201d and \nall but impossible to meet by amendment. The circuit \ncourt provided clarified pleading standards and identi-\nfied specific, remediable defects in the complaint. Re-\nspondents then promptly moved to vacate the district \ncourt\u2019s judgment in order to meet those clarified stand-\nards in an amended complaint\u2014their first in this litiga-\ntion. The district court refused and, after Respondents \nappealed again, the circuit issued a non-precedential \nsummary order remanding the case for \u201crecon-\nsider[ation].\u201d \nThe question presented is thus whether the circuit \ncourt erred in directing the district court to reconsider \nits refusal to grant Respondents an opportunity to meet \nthe pleading standards the circuit corrected in the prior \nappeal. \n \n \n\nii \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \nQUESTION PRESENTED ............................................. i \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES ......................................... iv \nINTRODUCTION .......................................................... 1 \nSTATEMENT ................................................................ 4 \nI. \nThe Complaint and Pre-Motion Conference for \nBLOM\u2019s Motion to Dismiss .............................. 4 \nII. \nThe Motion to Dismiss ..................................... 7 \nIII.

The dis-\ntrict court had denied vacatur because Plaintiffs de-\nclined its pre-dismissal invitations to amend their \ncomplaint\u2014but the circuit court found the district \ncourt was applying the \u201cwrong\u201d pleading standards, \nPet.App.5, which were so overly \u201cexacting\u201d that Plain-\ntiffs could not meet them before discovery, Pet.App.49.  \nPetitioner (\u201cBLOM\u201d) argues that by making this \nstraightforward remand, the Second Circuit has effec-\ntively \u201cabandon[ed] the \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 \nstandard in favor of a nebulous \u2018balanc[ing]\u2019 inquiry \nthat pits Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s protection of \u2018finality\u2019 against \n\u2018Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policies.\u2019\u201d Pet.Br.25 \n(quoting Pet.App.8). In BLOM\u2019s telling, the Second \nCircuit has \u201cjettisoned\u201d Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s guardrails, \nPet.Br.14., and motions for post-judgment amend-\nments will now be all but rubber-stamped in the cir-\ncuit. This is incorrect. \nFirst of all, this conclusion is not supported by the \nspare language of the summary order, which simply \ndirects the district court to \u201creconsider\u201d denying vaca-\ntur given Second Circuit and Supreme Court prece-\ndents. Nothing has been \u201cabandoned\u201d\u2014consistent \nwith decisions from this Court, \u201c[r]elief under Rule \n60(b)(6)\u201d in the Second Circuit \u201cis reserved for cases \nthat present \u2018extraordinary circumstances,\u2019\u201d including \nwhere a party seeks post-judgment amendment. Man-\ndala v. NTT Data, Inc., 88 F.4th 353, 361 (2d Cir. 2023) \n(citation omitted). Indeed, the standards the Second \n\n \n \n \n \n \n2 \n \nCircuit has \u201cdeveloped\u201d\u2014and reaffirmed by the sum-\nmary order below\u2014\u201cfor evaluating postjudgment mo-\ntions generally place significant emphasis on the \n\u2018value of finality and repose.\u2019\u201d Williams v. Citigroup \nInc., 659 F.3d 208, 213 (2d Cir. 2011) (citation omit-\nted). \nSecond, balancing finality and justice is not \u201cnebu-\nlous,\u201d as BLOM calls it, but rather inherent to Rule \n60(b)(6) jurisprudence: The rule\u2019s \u201cextraordinary cir-\ncumstances\u201d requirement \u201cexists in order to balance \nthe broad language of Rule 60(b)(6), which allows \ncourts to set aside judgments for \u2018any\u2019 reason justify-\ning relief, with the interest in the finality of judg-\nments.\u201d Budget Blinds, Inc. v. White, 536 F.3d 244, \n255 (3d Cir. 2008). When considering a motion to \namend a complaint, finality interests are \u201cbalance[d] \n. . . with the preference expressed in the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure in general, and Rule 15 in particu-\nlar, for resolving disputes on their merits.\u201d Krupski v. \nCosta Crociere S. p. A., 560 U.S. 538, 550 (2010).  \nThird, this case does involve truly \u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d because (1) the district court dismissed \nthe complaint using a set of \u201cwrong legal standards,\u201d \nincluding the nearly impossible requirement of alleg-\ning, without the opportunity for any discovery, \u201cacts or \nstatements\u201d of \u201cBLOM employees\u201d to demonstrate the \nbank\u2019s knowledge; (2) the circuit court rejected those \nstandards on appeal\u2014including the direct evidence re-\nquirement\u2014and \u201cclarified\u201d the correct ones; (3) the cir-\ncuit court found that Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations were none-\ntheless too \u201climited\u201d to meet the clarified standards, \ndrawing a newly announced distinction between \nPlaintiffs\u2019 \u201cpublicly available\u201d evidence and \u201cpublic \nsources such as media articles,\u201d Pet.App.50 & n.18; (4) \nthe circuit court identified several remediable defects \n\n \n \n \n \n \n3 \n \nin the complaint that the district court had not, such \nas clarifying that cash withdrawals are untraceable \nand alleging the degree to which Israeli terrorism des-\nignations were publicized; and (5) Plaintiffs had not \nyet amended their complaint even once. In these one-\nof-a-kind circumstances, the Rules\u2019 strong preference \nfor deciding cases on their merits entitles Plaintiffs to \nhave at least one opportunity to cure those defects. \nBLOM\u2019s argument is therefore premised on con-\nstruing the case\u2019s procedural history to suggest the \nSecond Circuit found that Plaintiffs \u201cwaived\u201d their \nright to amend post-judgment but nevertheless \u201cdi-\nrected district courts to override and rescue parties \nfrom their \u2018free, calculated, [and] deliberate choices,\u2019\u201d \nsuch as \u201cwhen the movant has consistently and con-\nsciously rejected numerous invitations and opportuni-\nties to amend.\u201d Pet.Br.28-29 (citations omitted).  \nBut the Second Circuit never accepted BLOM\u2019s \n\u201cwaiver\u201d argument. To the contrary, it recognized that \nPlaintiffs did not have a meaningful opportunity to \namend at all because \u201cthe district court applied the \nwrong legal standard for aiding-and-abetting liability \nunder JASTA,\u201d Pet.App.5, and a standard for pleading \nknowledge that was \u201ctoo exacting,\u201d Pet.App.49. In fact, \nthe district court\u2019s knowledge pleading standard was \nunmeetable\u2014as Circuit Court Judge Wesley noted in \nresponse to BLOM\u2019s insistence at oral argument that \nPlaintiffs waived opportunities to amend: \u201cWhat are \nthey supposed to do? They know they can\u2019t amend [to] \n. . . meet that.\u201d Oral Arg. at 11:52-:56, Honickman, No. \n22-1039 (2d Cir. Oct. 5, 2023), https://ww3.ca2. \nuscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/6a33dfa3-27c7-4b0a-\n82ee-86c41553c09a/1/doc/22-1039.mp3. \nIgnoring this, BLOM further insists that \u201cthe Sec-\nond Circuit affirmed the dismissal on grounds that the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n4 \n \nDistrict Court had relied on,\u201d Pet.Br. 40\u2014but the dis-\ntrict court itself acknowledged that the decision was \naffirmed \u201con other grounds.\u201d Pet.App.10. Most im-\nportantly, BLOM\u2019s reading of the record is irrelevant \nto the question presented\u2014the summary order below \nwas not premised on any such finding and thus did not \ndirect district courts to \u201coverride\u201d waivers.  \nThe unusual procedural history of this case makes \nclear that no meaningful opportunities to satisfy the \ncorrect legal standards were available to Plaintiffs and \ntherefore the remand to the district court was not a \ndeparture from Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s long-recognized stand-\nards. Rather, in the Second Circuit parties who de-\nclined meaningful invitations \u201care not entitled to relief \nfrom the judgment.\u201d Metzler Inv. GmbH v. Chipotle \nMexican Grill, Inc., 970 F.3d 133, 148 (2d Cir. 2020).  \nThis is not unusual\u2014the circuits broadly require \ndistrict courts to provide at least one opportunity to \namend, often after dismissal when the complaint\u2019s re-\nmediable defects, if any, are correctly identified by a \ncourt ruling. Refusing leave to amend after dismissal \nis thus often an abuse of discretion\u2014the result is no \ndifferent here, except that Plaintiffs were compelled to \nappeal the district court\u2019s erroneous decision first. \nSTATEMENT \nI. \nThe Complaint and Pre-Motion Conference \nfor BLOM\u2019s Motion to Dismiss \nPlaintiffs filed their complaint on January 1, 2019, \nasserting claims under the Anti-Terrorism Act \n(\u201cATA\u201d), as amended by the Justice Against Sponsors \nof Terrorism Act (\u201cJASTA\u201d), and alleging that BLOM \naided and abetted a series of terrorist attacks commit-\nted by the Palestinian foreign terrorist organization \n(\u201cFTO\u201d) Hamas (or \u201cHAMAS\u201d) that injured Plaintiffs. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n5 \n \nSpecifically, Plaintiffs alleged that BLOM knowingly \nprovided substantial assistance to three Hamas fund-\nraisers (the \u201cThree Customers\u201d), including the pur-\nported charitable institution Sanabil, which the \nUnited States designated a Specially Designated \nGlobal Terrorist (\u201cSDGT\u201d) in 2003. Relying in part on \nfinancial records disclosed during the criminal trial of \nthe Holy Land Foundation (\u201cHLF,\u201d a notorious Hamas \nfundraiser) in Texas, Plaintiffs alleged that BLOM as-\nsisted the Three Customers in converting millions of \ndollars of donations from HLF and other Hamas sup-\nporters abroad into cash (notwithstanding BLOM\u2019s de-\nscription of its services as \u201croutine,\u201d Pet.Br.5-6), which \nthey used, inter alia, to recruit Palestinians living in \nLebanon to join and support Hamas before and during \nthe \u201cSecond Intifada,\u201d when the acts of terrorism at is-\nsue here occurred.  \nPlaintiffs alleged BLOM\u2019s knowledge by \u201crefer-\nences to media articles and publications on the Three \nCustomers\u2019 connection to Hamas.\u201d Pet.App.49. Plain-\ntiffs also alleged that Sanabil\u2019s board included contem-\nporaneous Hamas leaders in Lebanon. JA.105, 114. \nPlaintiffs alleged that Israel designated another one of \nthe Three Customers, the Union of Good, as \u201cpart of \nthe Hamas organization\u201d in 2002, during the relevant \nperiod (1998-2004, JA.82). JA.118. The Union of \nGood\u2019s infamous leader, Sheikh Qaradawi, regularly \nappeared on television during that period extolling the \nvirtues of suicide bombings against Israel. JA.120.  \nPlaintiffs also alleged that BLOM converted mil-\nlions of dollars for the Three Customers from not only \nHLF, but also from its successor KindHearts after the \nUnited States designated HLF an SDGT in 2001, \nJA.99-100, 106-13, 117, and from Al Aqsa Foundation \nafter Israel designated it a Hamas entity and its \n\n \n \n \n \n \n6 \n \nheadquarters were shuttered by the German govern-\nment\u2014and one transaction after the United States \ndesignated it an SDGT. JA.95-96, 113.  \nOn May 3, 2019, BLOM filed a letter requesting a \npre-motion conference to initiate a motion to dismiss \nthe complaint for failure to state a claim, setting forth \na summary of its anticipated arguments. JA.142-47. \nThese arguments, which the district court later \nadopted in dismissing the complaint, were incon-\nsistent with JASTA\u2019s plain language, the interpreta-\ntive guidance in Halberstam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472 \n(D.C. Cir. 1983)\u2014which Congress set as the legal \nframework for JASTA\u2014and the Second Circuit\u2019s then-\nonly prior JASTA ruling in Linde v. Arab Bank, PLC, \n882 F.3d 314 (2d Cir. 2018).  \nPlaintiffs provided a summary of their anticipated \nopposition in a letter on May 8, 2019. JA.148-55. Spe-\ncifically, Plaintiffs relied on the standards from both \nLinde and Halberstam and noted that foreseeability \nwas the key factor in assessing a defendant\u2019s wrongful \nconduct under JASTA. As shown below, the district \ncourt ultimately adopted BLOM\u2019s arguments and re-\njected foreseeability. See Pet.App.71-72. The Second \nCircuit subsequently vindicated Plaintiffs\u2019 analysis, as \ndid this Court four years later. See Twitter, Inc. v. \nTaamneh, 598 U.S. 471, 496 (2023).  \nThe district court held a pre-motion conference on \nMay 15, 2019. After raising sua sponte whether BLOM \nhad an affirmative defense based on the statute of lim-\nitations, Pet.App.91, the court then stated:  \nI am just wondering if it might be prudent to \nallow the plaintiffs to amend their complaint, \nnot to add more claims, not to add more parties, \nbut rather to factually support some of the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n7 \n \nclaims that [defense counsel] have identified as \nbeing deficient regarding the standards that \nwere adopted by [Linde] from [Halberstam]. \n[Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel], do you want that oppor-\ntunity?  \nPet.App.93. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel responded, \u201cNo, I think \nwe are prepared to brief it based on the arguments pre-\nsented in [our] pre-motion letter.\u201d Id. This position was \nappropriate given that Plaintiffs\u2019 readings of Linde \nand Halberstam were substantively correct, whereas \nBLOM\u2019s contrary positions were not. \nFollowing the pre-motion conference, the district \ncourt issued a Minute Entry and Scheduling Order \nnoting: \u201cThe Court offered Plaintiffs an opportunity to \namend their complaint to add additional information \nin response to the arguments raised by Defendant. \nPlaintiffs declined . . . to amend their Complaint in \nthis regard.\u201d JA.156 (emphasis added). That is, the \ndistrict court offered Plaintiffs the opportunity to meet \nBLOM\u2019s urged legal standards, which they reasonably \ndeclined\u2014as shown by the circuit\u2019s later \u201cclarification\u201d \nof the applicable standards. \nII. \nThe Motion to Dis\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Circuit courts generally hold that \nmeans providing an opportunity to amend once a ruling \nidentifies remediable defects, if any, in a pleading. Fail-\ning to provide that opportunity may constitute an \u201cex-\ntraordinary circumstance\u201d and a basis to vacate a judg-\nment under Rule 60(b)(6).  \nHere, the Second Circuit found that the district \ncourt dismissed Respondents\u2019 complaint by applying \nthe \u201cwrong legal standard\u201d for pleading an aiding and \nabetting claim (in the Second Circuit) under the Justice \nAgainst Sponsors of Terrorism Act, as well as a stand-\nard for pleading knowledge that was \u201ctoo exacting\u201d and \nall but impossible to meet by amendment. The circuit \ncourt provided clarified pleading standards and identi-\nfied specific, remediable defects in the complaint. Re-\nspondents then promptly moved to vacate the district \ncourt\u2019s judgment in order to meet those clarified stand-\nards in an amended complaint\u2014their first in this litiga-\ntion. The district court refused and, after Respondents \nappealed again, the circuit issued a non-precedential \nsummary order remanding the case for \u201crecon-\nsider[ation].\u201d \nThe question presented is thus whether the circuit \ncourt erred in directing the district court to reconsider \nits refusal to grant Respondents an opportunity to meet \nthe pleading standards the circuit corrected in the prior \nappeal. \n \n \n\nii \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \nQUESTION PRESENTED ............................................. i \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES ......................................... iv \nINTRODUCTION .......................................................... 1 \nSTATEMENT ................................................................ 4 \nI. \nThe Complaint and Pre-Motion Conference for \nBLOM\u2019s Motion to Dismiss .............................. 4 \nII. \nThe Motion to Dismiss ..................................... 7 \nIII.

The dis-\ntrict court had denied vacatur because Plaintiffs de-\nclined its pre-dismissal invitations to amend their \ncomplaint\u2014but the circuit court found the district \ncourt was applying the \u201cwrong\u201d pleading standards, \nPet.App.5, which were so overly \u201cexacting\u201d that Plain-\ntiffs could not meet them before discovery, Pet.App.49.  \nPetitioner (\u201cBLOM\u201d) argues that by making this \nstraightforward remand, the Second Circuit has effec-\ntively \u201cabandon[ed] the \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 \nstandard in favor of a nebulous \u2018balanc[ing]\u2019 inquiry \nthat pits Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s protection of \u2018finality\u2019 against \n\u2018Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policies.\u2019\u201d Pet.Br.25 \n(quoting Pet.App.8). In BLOM\u2019s telling, the Second \nCircuit has \u201cjettisoned\u201d Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s guardrails, \nPet.Br.14., and motions for post-judgment amend-\nments will now be all but rubber-stamped in the cir-\ncuit. This is incorrect. \nFirst of all, this conclusion is not supported by the \nspare language of the summary order, which simply \ndirects the district court to \u201creconsider\u201d denying vaca-\ntur given Second Circuit and Supreme Court prece-\ndents. Nothing has been \u201cabandoned\u201d\u2014consistent \nwith decisions from this Court, \u201c[r]elief under Rule \n60(b)(6)\u201d in the Second Circuit \u201cis reserved for cases \nthat present \u2018extraordinary circumstances,\u2019\u201d including \nwhere a party seeks post-judgment amendment. Man-\ndala v. NTT Data, Inc., 88 F.4th 353, 361 (2d Cir. 2023) \n(citation omitted). Indeed, the standards the Second \n\n \n \n \n \n \n2 \n \nCircuit has \u201cdeveloped\u201d\u2014and reaffirmed by the sum-\nmary order below\u2014\u201cfor evaluating postjudgment mo-\ntions generally place significant emphasis on the \n\u2018value of finality and repose.\u2019\u201d Williams v. Citigroup \nInc., 659 F.3d 208, 213 (2d Cir. 2011) (citation omit-\nted). \nSecond, balancing finality and justice is not \u201cnebu-\nlous,\u201d as BLOM calls it, but rather inherent to Rule \n60(b)(6) jurisprudence: The rule\u2019s \u201cextraordinary cir-\ncumstances\u201d requirement \u201cexists in order to balance \nthe broad language of Rule 60(b)(6), which allows \ncourts to set aside judgments for \u2018any\u2019 reason justify-\ning relief, with the interest in the finality of judg-\nments.\u201d Budget Blinds, Inc. v. White, 536 F.3d 244, \n255 (3d Cir. 2008). When considering a motion to \namend a complaint, finality interests are \u201cbalance[d] \n. . . with the preference expressed in the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure in general, and Rule 15 in particu-\nlar, for resolving disputes on their merits.\u201d Krupski v. \nCosta Crociere S. p. A., 560 U.S. 538, 550 (2010).  \nThird, this case does involve truly \u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d because (1) the district court dismissed \nthe complaint using a set of \u201cwrong legal standards,\u201d \nincluding the nearly impossible requirement of alleg-\ning, without the opportunity for any discovery, \u201cacts or \nstatements\u201d of \u201cBLOM employees\u201d to demonstrate the \nbank\u2019s knowledge; (2) the circuit court rejected those \nstandards on appeal\u2014including the direct evidence re-\nquirement\u2014and \u201cclarified\u201d the correct ones; (3) the cir-\ncuit court found that Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations were none-\ntheless too \u201climited\u201d to meet the clarified standards, \ndrawing a newly announced distinction between \nPlaintiffs\u2019 \u201cpublicly available\u201d evidence and \u201cpublic \nsources such as media articles,\u201d Pet.App.50 & n.18; (4) \nthe circuit court identified several remediable defects \n\n \n \n \n \n \n3 \n \nin the complaint that the district court had not, such \nas clarifying that cash withdrawals are untraceable \nand alleging the degree to which Israeli terrorism des-\nignations were publicized; and (5) Plaintiffs had not \nyet amended their complaint even once. In these one-\nof-a-kind circumstances, the Rules\u2019 strong preference \nfor deciding cases on their merits entitles Plaintiffs to \nhave at least one opportunity to cure those defects. \nBLOM\u2019s argument is therefore premised on con-\nstruing the case\u2019s procedural history to suggest the \nSecond Circuit found that Plaintiffs \u201cwaived\u201d their \nright to amend post-judgment but nevertheless \u201cdi-\nrected district courts to override and rescue parties \nfrom their \u2018free, calculated, [and] deliberate choices,\u2019\u201d \nsuch as \u201cwhen the movant has consistently and con-\nsciously rejected numerous invitations and opportuni-\nties to amend.\u201d Pet.Br.28-29 (citations omitted).  \nBut the Second Circuit never accepted BLOM\u2019s \n\u201cwaiver\u201d argument. To the contrary, it recognized that \nPlaintiffs did not have a meaningful opportunity to \namend at all because \u201cthe district court applied the \nwrong legal standard for aiding-and-abetting liability \nunder JASTA,\u201d Pet.App.5, and a standard for pleading \nknowledge that was \u201ctoo exacting,\u201d Pet.App.49. In fact, \nthe district court\u2019s knowledge pleading standard was \nunmeetable\u2014as Circuit Court Judge Wesley noted in \nresponse to BLOM\u2019s insistence at oral argument that \nPlaintiffs waived opportunities to amend: \u201cWhat are \nthey supposed to do? They know they can\u2019t amend [to] \n. . . meet that.\u201d Oral Arg. at 11:52-:56, Honickman, No. \n22-1039 (2d Cir. Oct. 5, 2023), https://ww3.ca2. \nuscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/6a33dfa3-27c7-4b0a-\n82ee-86c41553c09a/1/doc/22-1039.mp3. \nIgnoring this, BLOM further insists that \u201cthe Sec-\nond Circuit affirmed the dismissal on grounds that the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n4 \n \nDistrict Court had relied on,\u201d Pet.Br. 40\u2014but the dis-\ntrict court itself acknowledged that the decision was \naffirmed \u201con other grounds.\u201d Pet.App.10. Most im-\nportantly, BLOM\u2019s reading of the record is irrelevant \nto the question presented\u2014the summary order below \nwas not premised on any such finding and thus did not \ndirect district courts to \u201coverride\u201d waivers.  \nThe unusual procedural history of this case makes \nclear that no meaningful opportunities to satisfy the \ncorrect legal standards were available to Plaintiffs and \ntherefore the remand to the district court was not a \ndeparture from Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s long-recognized stand-\nards. Rather, in the Second Circuit parties who de-\nclined meaningful invitations \u201care not entitled to relief \nfrom the judgment.\u201d Metzler Inv. GmbH v. Chipotle \nMexican Grill, Inc., 970 F.3d 133, 148 (2d Cir. 2020).  \nThis is not unusual\u2014the circuits broadly require \ndistrict courts to provide at least one opportunity to \namend, often after dismissal when the complaint\u2019s re-\nmediable defects, if any, are correctly identified by a \ncourt ruling. Refusing leave to amend after dismissal \nis thus often an abuse of discretion\u2014the result is no \ndifferent here, except that Plaintiffs were compelled to \nappeal the district court\u2019s erroneous decision first. \nSTATEMENT \nI. \nThe Complaint and Pre-Motion Conference \nfor BLOM\u2019s Motion to Dismiss \nPlaintiffs filed their complaint on January 1, 2019, \nasserting claims under the Anti-Terrorism Act \n(\u201cATA\u201d), as amended by the Justice Against Sponsors \nof Terrorism Act (\u201cJASTA\u201d), and alleging that BLOM \naided and abetted a series of terrorist attacks commit-\nted by the Palestinian foreign terrorist organization \n(\u201cFTO\u201d) Hamas (or \u201cHAMAS\u201d) that injured Plaintiffs. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n5 \n \nSpecifically, Plaintiffs alleged that BLOM knowingly \nprovided substantial assistance to three Hamas fund-\nraisers (the \u201cThree Customers\u201d), including the pur-\nported charitable institution Sanabil, which the \nUnited States designated a Specially Designated \nGlobal Terrorist (\u201cSDGT\u201d) in 2003. Relying in part on \nfinancial records disclosed during the criminal trial of \nthe Holy Land Foundation (\u201cHLF,\u201d a notorious Hamas \nfundraiser) in Texas, Plaintiffs alleged that BLOM as-\nsisted the Three Customers in converting millions of \ndollars of donations from HLF and other Hamas sup-\nporters abroad into cash (notwithstanding BLOM\u2019s de-\nscription of its services as \u201croutine,\u201d Pet.Br.5-6), which \nthey used, inter alia, to recruit Palestinians living in \nLebanon to join and support Hamas before and during \nthe \u201cSecond Intifada,\u201d when the acts of terrorism at is-\nsue here occurred.  \nPlaintiffs alleged BLOM\u2019s knowledge by \u201crefer-\nences to media articles and publications on the Three \nCustomers\u2019 connection to Hamas.\u201d Pet.App.49. Plain-\ntiffs also alleged that Sanabil\u2019s board included contem-\nporaneous Hamas leaders in Lebanon. JA.105, 114. \nPlaintiffs alleged that Israel designated another one of \nthe Three Customers, the Union of Good, as \u201cpart of \nthe Hamas organization\u201d in 2002, during the relevant \nperiod (1998-2004, JA.82). JA.118. The Union of \nGood\u2019s infamous leader, Sheikh Qaradawi, regularly \nappeared on television during that period extolling the \nvirtues of suicide bombings against Israel. JA.120.  \nPlaintiffs also alleged that BLOM converted mil-\nlions of dollars for the Three Customers from not only \nHLF, but also from its successor KindHearts after the \nUnited States designated HLF an SDGT in 2001, \nJA.99-100, 106-13, 117, and from Al Aqsa Foundation \nafter Israel designated it a Hamas entity and its \n\n \n \n \n \n \n6 \n \nheadquarters were shuttered by the German govern-\nment\u2014and one transaction after the United States \ndesignated it an SDGT. JA.95-96, 113.  \nOn May 3, 2019, BLOM filed a letter requesting a \npre-motion conference to initiate a motion to dismiss \nthe complaint for failure to state a claim, setting forth \na summary of its anticipated arguments. JA.142-47. \nThese arguments, which the district court later \nadopted in dismissing the complaint, were incon-\nsistent with JASTA\u2019s plain language, the interpreta-\ntive guidance in Halberstam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472 \n(D.C. Cir. 1983)\u2014which Congress set as the legal \nframework for JASTA\u2014and the Second Circuit\u2019s then-\nonly prior JASTA ruling in Linde v. Arab Bank, PLC, \n882 F.3d 314 (2d Cir. 2018).  \nPlaintiffs provided a summary of their anticipated \nopposition in a letter on May 8, 2019. JA.148-55. Spe-\ncifically, Plaintiffs relied on the standards from both \nLinde and Halberstam and noted that foreseeability \nwas the key factor in assessing a defendant\u2019s wrongful \nconduct under JASTA. As shown below, the district \ncourt ultimately adopted BLOM\u2019s arguments and re-\njected foreseeability. See Pet.App.71-72. The Second \nCircuit subsequently vindicated Plaintiffs\u2019 analysis, as \ndid this Court four years later. See Twitter, Inc. v. \nTaamneh, 598 U.S. 471, 496 (2023).  \nThe district court held a pre-motion conference on \nMay 15, 2019. After raising sua sponte whether BLOM \nhad an affirmative defense based on the statute of lim-\nitations, Pet.App.91, the court then stated:  \nI am just wondering if it might be prudent to \nallow the plaintiffs to amend their complaint, \nnot to add more claims, not to add more parties, \nbut rather to factually support some of the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n7 \n \nclaims that [defense counsel] have identified as \nbeing deficient regarding the standards that \nwere adopted by [Linde] from [Halberstam]. \n[Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel], do you want that oppor-\ntunity?  \nPet.App.93. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel responded, \u201cNo, I think \nwe are prepared to brief it based on the arguments pre-\nsented in [our] pre-motion letter.\u201d Id. This position was \nappropriate given that Plaintiffs\u2019 readings of Linde \nand Halberstam were substantively correct, whereas \nBLOM\u2019s contrary positions were not. \nFollowing the pre-motion conference, the district \ncourt issued a Minute Entry and Scheduling Order \nnoting: \u201cThe Court offered Plaintiffs an opportunity to \namend their complaint to add additional information \nin response to the arguments raised by Defendant. \nPlaintiffs declined . . . to amend their Complaint in \nthis regard.\u201d JA.156 (emphasis added). That is, the \ndistrict court offered Plaintiffs the opportunity to meet \nBLOM\u2019s urged legal standards, which they reasonably \ndeclined\u2014as shown by the circuit\u2019s later \u201cclarification\u201d \nof the applicable standards. \nII. \nThe Motion to Dismiss \nThe parties then briefed the motion to dismiss, in \nwhich they presented arguments largely consistent \nwith the summaries set forth in their pre-motion let-\nters.  \nDuring oral argument on the motion to dismiss, \nBLOM\u2019s counsel relied heavily on a district court deci-\nsion, Kaplan v. Lebanese Canadian Bank, SAL, 405 F. \nSupp. 3d 525 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (\u201cKaplan I\u201d), vac\u2019d in rel-\nevant part, 999 F.3d 842 (2d Cir. 2021) (\u201cKaplan II\u201d). \nKaplan I dismissed JASTA claims against Lebanese \nCanadian Bank (\u201cLCB\u201d), premised on allegations that \n\n \n \n \n \n \n8 \n \nLCB provided financial services for the terrorist group \nHezbollah. As BLOM pointed out, BLOM allegedly \nprovided financial services for Hamas fundraisers in \nLebanon much as LCB did for entities controlled by \nHezbollah. Pet.App.131. \nBLOM urged the district court to adopt Kaplan I\u2019s \nerroneous pleading standards\u2014including its unwork-\nable standard for pleading scienter. Under that stand-\nard, the Kaplan I district court held that public state-\nments and media reports tying five of LCB\u2019s customers \nto Hezbollah could not support an inference of LCB\u2019s \nknowledge of those ties because \u201cPlaintiffs nowhere al-\nlege . . . that Defendant read or was aware of such \nsources.\u201d 405 F. Supp. 3d at 535. Naturally, before dis-\ncovery, a plaintiff will rarely be able to find support for \nwhat sources a defendant has actually \u201cread\u201d or was \naware of. See Pet.App.50 n.18 (\u201cpublic sources\u201d can \n\u201cplausibly suggest a defendant\u2019s knowledge which can \nbe confirmed during discovery\u201d) (emphasis added).  \nNonetheless, BLOM\u2019s counsel argued: \nFinally, I wanted to point out that the level of \nknowledge that Judge Daniels rejected in \nKaplan [I] was very much what\u2019s claimed here, \nwhere it said that it was notorious that there \nwere links between the accounts at issue there, \nbetween those persons and in that case, Hezbol-\nlah. And that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s said here. It was \napparently notorious that BLOM should have \nknown that these accounts were linked to HA-\nMAS, but there\u2019s no direct allegation of why \nBLOM should have known that.  \nPet.App.131. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel disagreed, arguing \n\u201cKaplan [I] requires a level of proof that is out of step \n\n \n \n \n \n \n9 \n \nwith JASTA, out of step with Linde and would be im-\npossible to meet.\u201d Pet.App.126.  \nDuring the oral argument, the district court again \nasked: \u201cThere are no facts that you would have to offer \nto address some of the contentions of the defendants \nregarding knowledge, especially?\u201d Pet.App.125 (em-\nphasis added). But these \u201ccontentions\u201d premised on \nKaplan I were impossible to meet on amendment\u2014\nPlaintiffs possessed no evidence that any BLOM em-\nployee \u201cread or was aware of\u201d any specific piece of in-\nformation. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel explained that while \nthey \u201ccould always add allegations, . . . the complaint \ngoes far enough in saying that BLOM holding accounts \nfor Specially Designated Global Terrorists designated \nfor . . . financing HAMAS, was generally aware of its \nrole in that [il]licit conduct, and . . . the violence that \nresulted from it was foreseeable\u201d as set forth in Linde. \nId. \nIII. \nThe District Court\u2019s Decision on the Motion \nto Dismiss and First Appeal \nThe district court granted BLOM\u2019s motion to dis-\nmiss on January 14, 2020 (\u201cHonickman I\u201d), largely on \nthe grounds BLOM raised, including\u2014as BLOM \nurged\u2014by relying heavily on Kaplan I. The district \ncourt called Kaplan I \u201ca more appropriate comparison\u201d \nand \u201ca more appropriate point of reference\u201d than other \nJASTA and ATA cases to which Plaintiffs analogized \ntheir complaint. Pet.App.77, 84.  \nFor example, and of particular importance to the \nquestion presented here, the district court adopted \nKaplan I\u2019s \u201cread-or-was-aware-of\u201d standard for plead-\ning knowledge. The district court explained that in \nKaplan I, \n\n \n \n \n \n \n10 \n \nalthough the plaintiffs argued that the entities\u2019 \nconnections to Hizbollah \u201cwas [sic] openly, pub-\nlicly and repeatedly acknowledged and publi-\ncized by Hizbollah [through its own sources]\u201d \nand \u201cin various English-language publications,\u201d \nthe plaintiffs \u201cnowhere allege[d] . . . that [LCB] \nread or was aware of such sources.\u201d The same \nanalysis applies even more strongly here, given \nthe relatively greater strength of the allegations \nin Kaplan [I]. \nPet.App.79 (quoting Kaplan I, 405 F. Supp. 3d at 535) \n(emphasis added). Having adopted this position, the \ndistrict court then faulted Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint for \nlacking allegations citing \u201cacts or statements by \nBLOM or BLOM\u2019s employees\u201d regarding its customers\u2019 \naffiliations with Hamas, instead relying on \u201cpress ar-\nticles, government actions, and allegedly \u2018public \nknowledge\u2019 discussing\u201d such connections. Pet.App.73-\n74.  \nUnsurprisingly, financial institutions do not often \npublicly admit their knowledge of their roles in assist-\ning terrorism. Therefore, moving to amend after dis-\nmissal in this case\u2014or accepting the district court\u2019s in-\nvitations to amend, such as during oral argument \nwhere BLOM demanded \u201cdirect allegation[s]\u201d of its \nknowledge, Pet.App.131\u2014would have been pointless. \nAnd while the Second Circuit also ultimately found \nPlaintiffs\u2019 allegations of BLOM\u2019s knowledge of the \nThree Customers\u2019 Hamas affiliations insufficient, it \ndid so for reasons that could be remedied by replead-\ning\u2014such as by pleading more allegations of (1) \u201cpub-\nlic sources\u201d demonstrating that Israeli terrorism des-\nignations were made public, (2) banks\u2019 policies for \nmonitoring counterparties, and (3) the untraceable na-\nture of cash. None of those grounds required alleging \n\n \n \n \n \n \n11 \n \nBLOM\u2019s internal communications or deliberations at \nthe pleading stage showing that BLOM \u201cread or was \naware\u201d of such sources.  \nPlaintiffs timely appealed the district court\u2019s dis-\nmissal decision. Because Kaplan I was also on appeal, \nthe Second Circuit held Honickman in abeyance and \ndirected the parties to submit supplemental briefs on \nthe \u201cissue of how [Kaplan] applies to this case,\u201d once \ndecided. JA.257-258. The circuit subsequently issued \nKaplan II, vacating Kaplan I\u2019s dismissal of JASTA aid-\ning and abetting claims against LCB. See 999 F.3d \n842. Kaplan II largely clarified the standards for \nJASTA liability, as Plaintiffs explained in their sup-\nplemental brief. JA.259-281. BLOM, however, argued \nthat Kaplan II somehow \u201cunderscore[d] the soundness \nof the District Court\u2019s legal analysis,\u201d despite vacating \nits primary support\u2014Kaplan I. JA.294. The circuit \nthen issued its first decision in Honickman on July 29, \n2021 (\u201cHonickman II\u201d). \nIV. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s Assessment of the Dis-\ntrict Court\u2019s Dismissal Decision  \nThe Second Circuit \u201cagree[d]\u201d with Plaintiffs \u201cthat \nthe [district] court did not apply the proper standard \n. . . .\u201d Pet.App.24. Specifically, the circuit rejected \nevery standard the district court applied as grounds \nfor dismissal, including the direct-evidence standard \nfor alleging BLOM\u2019s knowledge of the Three Custom-\ners\u2019 affiliations with Hamas. It also rejected the dis-\ntrict court\u2019s standards for alleging the general aware-\nness and substantial assistance elements, which to-\ngether \u201cform the crux of most JASTA aiding-and-abet-\nting cases.\u201d Pet.App.37. These holdings are detailed \nbelow. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n12 \n \nBLOM \nlargely \nignores \nthese \nholdings. \nSee \nPet.Br.40. But the district court was more forthcom-\ning\u2014it acknowledged that the circuit court only af-\nfirmed on \u201cother grounds.\u201d Pet.App.10. BLOM also \ntries to rehabilitate the district court\u2019s dismissal order \nby suggesting it conforms to this Court\u2019s analysis in \nTaamneh. See Pet.Br.6-7, 8 n.2. But, of course, \nTaamneh affirmed the foreseeability standard from \nHalberstam\u2014the Honickman district court, \u201chowever, \nrejected the foreseeability principle.\u201d Pet.App.39.  \nMoreover, Taamneh had not been issued when \nPlaintiffs sought post-judgment amendment to meet \nthe Second Circuit\u2019s \u201cclarifications\u201d in Kaplan II and \nHonickman II. The issue in this case is the standard \nfor post-judgment amendment where a district court \nhas misapplied controlling law\u2014that is, the law of the \ncircuit. And even if Taamneh had completely repudi-\nated the Second Circuit\u2019s interpretation of JASTA, \nthat would only have provided a further reason to af-\nford Plaintiffs an opportunity to meet this Court\u2019s \nnewly-articulated standard. \nA. The District Court Applied the Wrong \nStandard for Pleading Knowledge \nThe most decisive problem with the district court\u2019s \ndismissal decision was its articulated standard for \npleading knowledge, which required Plaintiffs to al-\nlege \u201cacts or statements by BLOM or BLOM\u2019s employ-\nees\u201d showing their knowledge. Pet.App.73. The Second \nCircuit explained why this standard was incorrect:  \nIn assessing this element, the district court \nfound that the complaint\u2019s references to media \narticles and publications on the Three Custom-\ners\u2019 connection to Hamas were insufficient be-\ncause \u201cPlaintiffs fail[ed] plausibly to allege that \n\n \n \n \n \n \n13 \n \nBLOM [Bank] . . . actually knew or should have \nknown of any of the cited sources.\u201d However, as \nwe explained in Kaplan [II], Plaintiffs did not \nneed to allege that BLOM Bank knew or should \nhave known of the public sources at the plead-\ning stage. Such a requirement at this juncture \nwould be too exacting. \nPet.App.49 (citations omitted). \nThe district court had adopted its erroneous stand-\nard from Kaplan I, before it was vacated in relevant \npart. In Kaplan II, the circuit explained that \u201c[a] com-\nplaint is allowed to contain general allegations as to a \ndefendant\u2019s knowledge because \u2018a plaintiff realistically \ncannot be expected to plead a defendant\u2019s actual state \nof mind,\u2019\u201d although plaintiffs must \u201cinclude allegations \nof the facts or events they claim give rise to an infer-\nence of knowledge.\u201d 999 F.3d at 864 (citations omit-\nted). Moreover, the district court must \u201cconsider all of \nthe complaint\u2019s allegations, rather than considering \neach in isolation, and to accept as true all permissible \ninferences that could be drawn from the complaint as \na whole.\u201d Id. at 865.1  \nThis correction is critical. While Plaintiffs\u2019 pro-\nposed amended complaint submitted in support of \n \n1  \nThe Honickman district court also echoed Kaplan I in \npointing out that with one exception cited in the complaint, the \nU.S. did not designate the Three Customers or their counterpar-\nties as SDGTs until after the transfers at issue (although Israel \nhad designated several of the counterparties as terrorist organi-\nzations years before). See Pet.App.74-75. The circuit rejected this \nstandard in Kaplan II as well, writing: \u201cThe [Kaplan I] court cited \nno authority for such a prerequisite for knowledge, and we know \nof none; and it would defy common sense to hold that such \nknowledge could be gained in no other way.\u201d 999 F.3d at 864. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n14 \n \ntheir vacatur motion contained numerous additional \n\u201cpublic source\u201d allegations (including publications in \nEnglish, French and Arabic) to further support the \n\u201cpermissible inferences\u201d of BLOM\u2019s contemporaneous \nknowledge that it was providing substantial assis-\ntance to Hamas, JA.315-508, those allegations would \nnot satisfy Kaplan I\u2019s \u201cread or was aware of\u201d require-\nment adopted by the district court below. \nB. The District Court Applied the Wrong \nJASTA Standards \nThe Second Circuit also explained that the district \ncourt applied the wrong standards for assessing the \nJASTA elements.  \nAs to general awareness, the Second Circuit first \nset forth the standard given in Halberstam and \nacknowledged in Linde: \u201c[t]he defendant need not be \ngenerally aware of its role in the specific act that \ncaused the plaintiff\u2019s injury; instead, it must be gener-\nally aware of its role in an overall illegal activity from \nwhich the act that caused the plaintiff\u2019s injury was \nforeseeable.\u201d Pet.App.37 (citing Halberstam, 705 F.2d \nat 477, 488). It then explained that the district court \ndid not apply this standard:  \nThe district court, however, rejected the foresee-\nability principle, holding that \u201cit is not enough \nfor Plaintiffs to plausibl[y] allege that BLOM \n[Bank] was generally aware of [its] role in ter-\nrorist activities, from which terrorist attacks \nwere a natural and foreseeable consequence.\u201d \nThe court\u2019s conclusion contravenes both Hal-\nberstam and Linde[], one of the first cases in \nwhich we interpreted aiding-and-abetting lia-\nbility under JASTA. \nPet.App.39 (quoting Pet.App.71-72).  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n15 \n \nIn Taamneh, this Court likewise confirmed that:  \nAs Halberstam makes clear, people who aid and \nabet a tort can be held liable for other torts that \nwere \u201ca foreseeable risk\u201d of the intended \ntort. Accordingly, a close nexus between the as-\nsistance and the tort might help establish that \nthe defendant aided and abetted the tort, but \neven more remote support can still constitute \naiding and abetting in the right case. \n598 U.S. at 496 (quoting Halberstam, 705 F.2d at 488). \nThe Second Circuit rejected BLOM\u2019s argument \nthat providing indirect assistance changes the stand-\nard for pleading knowledge, explaining that \u201cKaplan \n[II] did not so hold; instead, it asserted \u2018the actual \nknowledge component of the Halberstam standard re-\nquires that the defendant \u201cknow[ ]\u201d that it is providing \n\u201cassistance,\u201d . . . whether directly to the FTO or indi-\nrectly through an intermediary.\u2019\u201d Pet.App.46 n.16 \n(quoting Kaplan II, 999 F.3d at 863-64). See also \nPet.App.45 n.15 (rejecting BLOM\u2019s argument regard-\ning customer activities).  \nThe circuit\u2019s Honickman II and Kaplan II decisions \nalso rejected the district court\u2019s assertion that \u201cthe \nmere provision of routine banking services to an FTO \ndoes not render a bank liable for civil aiding and abet-\nting.\u201d Pet.App.71. The Kaplan II court explained that \nso-called \u201croutine\u201d services could suffice depending on \nthe circumstances, and that, under Linde, \u201cwhether a \ndefendant bank\u2019s \u2018financial services to [an FTO or its \naffiliates should or] should not be viewed as routine\u2019 is \na \u2018question[] of fact for a jury to decide.\u2019\u201d 999 F.3d at \n858 (quoting Linde, 882 F.3d at 327) (alterations orig-\ninal to Kaplan II). See also Taamneh, 598 U.S. at 502 \n(noting circumstances \u201cwhere the provider of routine \n\n \n \n \n \n \n16 \n \nservices\u201d could be liable for \u201caiding and abetting a fore-\nseeable terror attack\u201d). \nThe Second Circuit also found that the district \ncourt applied incorrect standards to plead the knowing \nand substantial assistance element. This included \nmisapprehending the \u201cknowing\u201d prong under circuit \nlaw2 and misapplying each of the Halberstam substan-\ntial assistance factors it analyzed. Pet.App.45.  \nThe district court \u201cmisunderstood the first factor, \n\u2018the nature of the act encouraged,\u2019 to be a question of \nwhether Plaintiffs plausibly alleged \u2018that BLOM \n[Bank] knowingly encouraged Hamas\u2019[s] violent activ-\nities, such as those which caused Plaintiffs\u2019 injuries.\u2019\u201d \nPet.App.46. Indeed, the Halberstam defendant did not \n\u201cencourage\u201d her burglar boyfriend to commit the un-\nplanned murder of Dr. Halberstam, of which she had \nno knowledge.  \nThe district court also applied too exacting a stand-\nard for \u201cthe second factor, \u2018the amount of assistance,\u2019\u201d \nrequiring allegations of how the money BLOM moved \nfor Hamas actually made it through the FTO\u2019s fronts. \nTo the contrary, \u201c[f]actual allegations that permit a \nreasonable inference that the defendant recognized \nthe money it transferred to its customers would be re-\nceived by the FTO would suffice.\u201d Pet.App.47. \n \n2  \nThe Second Circuit did not, as some JASTA defendants \nhave suggested, \u201canalyze[] the \u2018knowing\u2019 subelement as a carbon \ncopy of the antecedent element of whether the defendants were \n\u2018generally aware\u2019 of their role in ISIS\u2019 overall scheme.\u201d Taamneh, \n598 U.S. at 503 (citations omitted). It only observed that the same \nfacts could satisfy both mental state elements: \u201cFor instance, Hal-\nberstam . . . . did not require [the defendant] to \u2018know\u2019 anything \nmore about [the murderer\u2019s] unlawful activities than what she \nknew for the general awareness element.\u201d Pet.App.46.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n17 \n \nFinally, under the fourth factor, the defendant\u2019s re-\nlation to the principal, \u201c[t]he district court erroneously \nconstrued\u201d Second Circuit precedent \u201cto mean that \nPlaintiffs must plead a direct relationship between \nBLOM Bank and Hamas.\u201d Pet.App.47-48. A less direct \nrelationship, depending on the circumstances, could \nsuffice. \nAgain, these errors align with BLOM\u2019s \u201cargu-\nments\u201d and \u201ccontentions\u201d to which the district court \ninvited Plaintiffs to respond by amendment. JA.156, \nPet.App.125. Plaintiffs reasonably declined these invi-\ntations, as evidenced by the Second Circuit\u2019s complete \nrejection of them. \nC. The Second Circuit Affirmed the District \nCourt Decision Only on Another Ground \nThe Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal decision \nentirely on one ground: \u201cWe conclude that Plaintiffs\u2019 \naiding-and-abetting claim fails because the allegations \ndo not support an inference that BLOM Bank was \naware of the Three Customers\u2019 ties with Hamas prior \nto the relevant attacks, thereby undermining the sec-\nond element of general awareness.\u201d Pet.App.49. But \nwhereas the district court required allegations of \u201cacts \nor statements\u201d from \u201cBLOM employees\u201d demonstrat-\ning their actual knowledge (which Plaintiffs naturally \ndid not have before discovery), the Second Circuit \nidentified a less exacting set of specific and remediable \ndeficiencies in the complaint\u2019s knowledge allegations. \nChief among these was the circuit\u2019s finding that \nPlaintiffs\u2019 evidence of the Three Customers\u2019 Hamas af-\nfiliations was \u201cpublicly available,\u201d rather than from \n\u201cpublic sources\u201d: \nHowever, \u201cpublicly available\u201d evidence is not \nthe same as public sources such as media \n\n \n \n \n \n \n18 \n \narticles. The latter, depending on their sub-\nstance, \nplausibly \nsuggest \na \ndefendant\u2019s \nknowledge which can be confirmed during dis-\ncovery, whereas the former requires the implau-\nsible inference that the defendant was aware of \nthose facts even before the news media. \nPet.App.50 n.18. The court then went on to find Plain-\ntiffs\u2019 allegations of \u201cpublic sources\u201d too \u201climited\u201d in de-\ntail and numerosity. Pet.App.51. \nPlaintiffs understandably did not anticipate this \nnew evidentiary distinction (the district court cer-\ntainly did not). Moreover, the Second Circuit did not \ncite any precedent for this position, and it is by all ap-\npearances a newly articulated distinction. Nor did the \nKaplan II decision mention any distinction between \n\u201cpublicly available evidence\u201d and \u201cpublic sources\u201d of \nevidence. In fact, \u201cpublicly available evidence\u201d echoes \nthe term the Second Circuit had previously used as a \nbasis for inferring knowledge, relying on this Court\u2019s \nprecedent: \u201cPublicly available information may pro-\nvide relevant circumstantial evidence of actual \nknowledge.\u201d Fed. Hous. Fin. Agency v. Nomura Hold-\ning Am., Inc., 873 F.3d 85, 122 (2d Cir. 2017) (empha-\nsis added) (citing Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa, 539 U.S. \n90, 100 (2003)). Indeed, it seems reasonable that \nbanks, given their unique Know-Your-Customer obli-\ngations and due diligence policies, which assume close \nmonitoring of customer accounts and transactions, \nwould know facts about their customers \u201cbefore the \nnews media\u201d report it (which involves deciding what is \nnewsworthy and what facts are verifiable).  \nBut no matter\u2014Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed amended com-\nplaint included numerous and detailed allegations of \ncontemporaneous \u201cpublic sources\u201d to meet the Second \nCircuit\u2019s requirement.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n19 \n \nThe other defects the circuit identified were also re-\nmediable. For example, the circuit discounted Plain-\ntiffs\u2019 assertion that BLOM must have noticed that the \nThree Customers were receiving funds from desig-\nnated terrorist entities. The circuit noted that the com-\nplaint alleged that Sanabil received transfers from the \n\u201cAl-Aqsa Foundation\u201d after Israel designated it as a \nterrorist organization, but not \u201cwhether and where \nthis [designation] was made public.\u201d Pet.App.52 n.20. \nThe circuit also noted that the complaint needed \u201cfur-\nther allegations\u201d to show that a defendant-bank would \nknow about \u201ctransfers of funds from non-customers as-\nsociated with an FTO to the defendant\u2019s customers.\u201d \nId.  \nThese defects were not due to unreasonable draft-\ning\u2014previous ATA decisions found it reasonable to in-\nfer that a foreign bank would \u201cmonitor publicly avail-\nable information,\u201d including \u201cIsraeli lists of terrorists.\u201d \nWeiss v. Nat\u2019l Westminster Bank PLC, 453 F. Supp. \n2d 609, 627 (E.D.N.Y. 2006) (emphasis added). But the \nproposed amended complaint now includes media re-\nports on the relevant Israeli designations and BLOM\u2019s \nown customer due diligence procedures, such as moni-\ntoring transfer counterparties and non-profit organi-\nzations, which are often used as terror fronts.  \nSimilarly, although Plaintiffs repeatedly empha-\nsized the suspicious nature of Sanabil making large \ncash withdrawals from its BLOM account, the circuit \nsuggesting that the complaint should more explicitly \nallege that cash is \u201cuntraceable.\u201d Pet.App.51 n.19. Alt-\nhough Plaintiffs took that characteristic of cash to be \na reasonable inference rather than a necessary allega-\ntion, they included those explicit allegations in the \nproposed amended complaint. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n20 \n \nV. \nPlaintiffs\u2019 Motion to Vacate and Amend and \nthe Second Appeal \nAs the Second Circuit explained in the summary \norder below, the district court had applied the \u201cwrong \nlegal standards\u201d in dismissing the complaint, so once \n\u201c[a]rmed with this Court\u2019s clarifications, Plaintiffs re-\nturned to the district court,\u201d promptly moving (11 days \nafter Honickman II issued\u2014in fact, before the man-\ndate issued) under Rules 60(b)(6) and 15(a)(2) to va-\ncate the judgment of dismissal and grant them leave \nto file a first amended complaint. JA.315. The district \ncourt denied the motion, concluding that Plaintiffs \nfailed to show extraordinary circumstances chiefly be-\ncause they declined the district court\u2019s two prior invi-\ntations to meet the erroneous and largely impossible \npleading standard BLOM urged and that the district \ncourt erroneously adopted.  \nPlaintiffs again appealed. During argument, Cir-\ncuit Court Judge Wesley\u2014who also authored Honick-\nman II\u2014noted the case constituted an \u201cunusual cir-\ncumstance,\u201d 10/5/2023 Oral Arg. at 3:40, and \u201ca curi-\nous situation,\u201d id. at 10:54, and was \u201cquirky,\u201d id. at \n18:07. And as he recognized, Plaintiffs faced \u201ca wrong \nstandard\u201d \u201cthat\u2019s even harder for them to meet.\u201d Judge \nWesley observed: \u201cWhat are they supposed to do? They \nknow they can\u2019t amend [to] . . . meet that\u201d standard. \nId. at 11:50-56. The dismissal was \u201c[a]ffirmed for a dif-\nferent reason,\u201d as a result of a series of cases \u201cwhere \nthe law was really recasting itself.\u201d Id. at 13:12-38. \nAfter that oral argument in this case, the Second \nCircuit decided Mandala, another \u201cone of the excep-\ntional cases necessitating relief from judgment.\u201d Man-\ndala, 88 F.4th at 365. In Mandala, the plaintiffs \nbrought a putative class action alleging that defendant \nNTT Data\u2019s policy of not hiring people with felony \n\n \n \n \n \n \n21 \n \nconvictions disproportionately harms Black appli-\ncants. See id. at 357. The plaintiffs cited government \nreports showing \u201cBlack people are arrested and incar-\ncerated at higher rates than others.\u201d Id. The district \ncourt dismissed the complaint because it did not show \nthat there was a similar disparity among Black appli-\ncants for NTT\u2019s positions specifically.  \nThe Second Circuit affirmed, \u201cagree[ing] with the \ndistrict court\u201d that the complaint\u2019s statistics did not \nfocus on \u201cappropriate comparator groups.\u201d Id. at 357-\n58 (citation omitted). However, the circuit recognized \n\u201cthat such granular data may be impossible to collect \nwithout discovery,\u201d and that \u201cthe Complaint might \nhave survived dismissal if it had contained allegations \nexplaining \u2018why their chosen national statistics are in \nfact likely to be representative of NTT\u2019s qualified ap-\nplicant pool.\u2019\u201d Id. at 358 (citation omitted). The plain-\ntiffs petitioned for rehearing en banc, and although it \nwas denied, the dissenting judges urged the plaintiffs \nto move for vacatur and leave to amend. The plaintiffs \ndid, and the district court denied the motion.  \nOn appeal, the second Mandala panel acknowl-\nedged that \u201c[i]t wasn\u2019t until this Court\u2019s decision on \nappeal that it became clear what other types of infor-\nmation might suffice at the pleading stage.\u201d Id. at 365. \nAs a result, the panel vacated that denial and re-\nmanded the motion for reconsideration given Foman, \nthe Second Circuit cases Metzler and Williams, and \nother precedents.  \nRecognizing that its \u201cdiscussion of the various con-\nsiderations in Mandala will be particularly helpful to \nthe district court\u2019s analysis\u201d of Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for \nvacatur and leave to amend, the Second Circuit issued \nthe summary order below, likewise citing Foman and \nMetzler. Pet.App.1-8. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n22 \n \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n1. Second Circuit precedent does not meaningfully \ndiffer from other circuits\u2019 post-judgment amendment \nholdings. The summary order below does not \u201chold\u201d \nanything, and the precedents it cites are typical of \nRule 60(b)(6) cases. For example, they uncontrover-\nsially hold that \u201c[r]elief under Rule 60(b)(6) is reserved \nfor cases that present \u2018extraordinary circumstances.\u2019\u201d \nMandala, 88 F.4th at 361 (quoting Liljeberg v. Health \nServs. Acquisition Corp., 486 U.S. 847, 863 (1988)).  \nThis case involves highly exceptional circum-\nstances. The district court applied erroneous stand-\nards for pleading aiding and abetting under JASTA, \nincluding a knowledge pleading standard that was all \nbut impossible to meet. Pet.App.5, 49. Plaintiffs rea-\nsonably declined the district court\u2019s invitation to \namend to meet those erroneous standards. The Second \nCircuit \u201cagree[d]\u201d that those standards were incorrect, \nbut found the complaint did not meet the standards it \n\u201cclarified\u201d on appeal. Pet.App.25, 40 n.11. After the \ndistrict court refused to let Plaintiffs amend their com-\nplaint to meet the clarified standard, the Second Cir-\ncuit directed it to reconsider, given prior precedents. It \ndid not dictate a particular outcome.  \n2. The balancing test the circuit court described is \nalso typical of Rule 60(b)(6) cases. The Second Circuit \nrejects allowing the \u201cliberal amendment policy of Rule \n15(a) to swallow the philosophy favoring finality of \njudgments whole.\u201d Metzler, 970 F.3d at 146 (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted). Rather, the \ntest balances Rule 60(b)\u2019s value of finality \u201cwith the \npreference expressed in the Federal Rules of Civil Pro-\ncedure in general, and Rule 15 in particular, for resolv-\ning disputes on their merits.\u201d Krupski, 560 U.S. at \n550. After all, \u201cthe \u2018whole purpose\u2019 of Rule 60(b) \u2018is to \n\n \n \n \n \n \n23 \n \nmake an exception to finality.\u2019\u201d Buck v. Davis, 580 U.S. \n100, 126 (2017) (citations omitted). \nThe practical effect of that balance is far more mod-\nest than BLOM suggests: \u201cIn the post-judgment con-\ntext, we have indeed given \u2018due regard\u2019 to \u2018the liberal \nspirit of Rule 15\u2019 by ensuring plaintiffs at least one op-\nportunity to replead.\u201d Metzler, 970 F.3d at 146 (quot-\ning Williams, 659 F.3d at 213-14). See also Mandala, \n88 F.4th at 362 (same). Courts regularly recognize the \nimportance of providing plaintiffs an opportunity to \namend their complaints once apprised of actual defects \nin them. Where the dismissal standards are wrong, \nhowever, \u201cthe proper recourse\u201d is an appeal, United \nStates v. Mask of Ka-Nefer-Nefer, 752 F.3d 737, 743 \n(8th Cir. 2014), which Plaintiffs here took. None of \nBLOM\u2019s cited cases suggest that under the circum-\nstances present here Plaintiffs would not be entitled to \namend. \n3. BLOM\u2019s appeal is premised on the unsupported \ninference that the Second Circuit agreed that Plain-\ntiffs \u201cwaived\u201d their opportunities to amend but then \n\u201cdirected district courts to override and rescue parties \nfrom their \u2018free, calculated, [and] deliberate choices.\u2019\u201d \nPet.Br.28-29. But the Second Circuit did not find any \nwaiver. Quite the opposite, it suggested Plaintiffs rea-\nsonably appealed the district court\u2019s dismissal deci-\nsion and never received a meaningful opportunity to \nmeet the correct and newly clarified standards\u2014and \nthus had nothing to waive.  \nBLOM\u2019s litany of \u201cwaived\u201d opportunities to amend \nare not supported by the record and in any event were \nnot accepted by the panel below in discussing post-\njudgment amendment standards. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n24 \n \n4. The Second Circuit\u2019s precedents do not conflict \nwith the text of Rule 60(b) or Rule 15(a). The Second \nCircuit requires determining which Rule 60(b) provi-\nsion applies as a \u201cthreshold issue,\u201d before considering \namendment. Mandala, 88 F.4th at 359. The desire to \namend a complaint itself is insufficient. \n5. Extraordinary circumstances are clearly present \nhere, for the reasons stated above. Plaintiffs were not \nafforded a meaningful opportunity to address actual \ndefects in their complaint. They properly appealed the \ndistrict court\u2019s erroneous decision and then promptly \nsought vacatur to meet the clarified standards the cir-\ncuit issued on appeal. Discovery has not even com-\nmenced\u2014this case is in its infancy, and Plaintiffs \nshould have the opportunity to have their case adjudi-\ncated on the merits. \nARGUMENT  \nI. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s Analysis Is Consistent \nwith Post-Judgment Amendment Jurispru-\ndence Nationally. \nBLOM asserts that the summary order below \n\u201cabandons the \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 standard \nin favor of a nebulous \u2018balanc[ing]\u2019 inquiry that pits \nRule 60(b)(6)\u2019s protection of \u2018finality\u2019 against \u2018Rule \n15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policies.\u2019\u201d Pet.Br.25 (quot-\ning Pet.App.8). This is inaccurate.  \nFirst, as Respondent acknowledges, the decision \nbelow is a non-precedential summary order which \nmerely \u201c[r]el[ies] on a series of Second Circuit prece-\ndents.\u201d Pet.Br.20. In fact, the order only cites three de-\ncisions on post-judgment amendment\u2014Mandala and \nMetzler from the Second Circuit, and Foman v. Davis, \n371 U.S. 178 (1962), from this Court.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n25 \n \nSecond, these decisions are not erroneous and cer-\ntainly do not \u201cjettison\u201d the extraordinary circum-\nstances standard, as BLOM claims. Pet.Br.14. Man-\ndala holds that \u201c[r]elief under Rule 60(b)(6) is reserved \nfor cases that present \u2018extraordinary circumstances.\u2019\u201d \n88 F.4th at 361 (quoting Liljeberg, 486 U.S. at 863). \nAnd in Metzler, the Second Circuit affirmed denial of \npost-judgment amendment because \u201cthe plaintiffs-ap-\npellants fail[ed] to identify any \u2018extraordinary circum-\nstances\u2019 that would \u2018justify[] relief\u2019 under Rule \n60(b)(6).\u201d 970 F.3d at 147. \nAs explained below, the \u201cextraordinary circum-\nstances\u201d here are clear. This case is, as Judge Wesley \nput it, \u201cunusual,\u201d \u201cquirky,\u201d and \u201ccurious,\u201d appearing to \ndeny Plaintiffs even a single meaningful opportunity \nto amend. The Second Circuit therefore directed the \ndistrict court to reconsider its denial of vacatur given \nthe standards in Mandala and Metzler. As this re-\nmand reflected, Rule 60(b)(6) motions inherently re-\nquire \u201ccase-by-case inquiry,\u201d Stokes v. Williams, 475 \nF.3d 732, 736 (6th Cir. 2007)). Indeed, even if this \nCourt wanted to revisit its jurisprudence on Rule \n60(b), it is difficult to imagine it being able to fashion \nany generally applicable standard based on the \u201cunu-\nsual\u201d procedural history of this case. \nA. Rule 60(b)(6) Jurisprudence Balances Fi-\nnality and the Preference for Deciding \nCases on Their Merits. \nMandala and Metzler both apply the balancing test \narticulated in Williams v. Citigroup: \u201cpostjudgment \nmotions for leave to replead must be evaluated with \ndue regard to both the value of finality and the policies \nembodied in Rule 15.\u201d 659 F.3d at 213. Finality thus \nremains the starting point for applying Rule 60(b)(6) \nin the Second Circuit: \u201c[t]he standards we have \n\n \n \n \n \n \n26 \n \ndeveloped for evaluating postjudgment motions gener-\nally place significant emphasis on the \u2018value of finality \nand repose.\u2019\u201d Id. (citation omitted). The circuit notes \nthat \u2018\u201c[t]o hold otherwise would enable the liberal \namendment policy of Rule 15(a) to be employed in a \nway that is contrary to the philosophy favoring finality \nof judgments and the expeditious termination of liti-\ngation.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Nat\u2019l Petrochemical Co. v. M/T \nStolt Sheaf, 930 F.2d 240, 245 (2d Cir. 1991)). \nFinality is then balanced with Rule 15(a)\u2019s prefer-\nence for resolving cases on their merits, which the Wil-\nliams panel sourced from this Court\u2019s \u201c[p]articularly \ninstructive\u201d Foman decision. 695 F.3d at 213. Foman \nheld that the district court abused its discretion in \ndenying a motion to vacate the judgment in order to \namend the complaint:  \nRule 15(a) declares that leave to amend \u201cshall \nbe freely given when justice so requires\u201d; this \nmandate is to be heeded. See generally, 3 \nMoore, Federal Practice (2d ed. 1948), paras. \n15.08, 15.10. If the underlying facts or circum-\nstances relied upon by a plaintiff may be a \nproper subject of relief, he ought to be afforded \nan opportunity to test his claim on the mer-\nits. In the absence of any apparent or declared \nreason \u2014 such as undue delay, bad faith or di-\nlatory motive on the part of the movant, re-\npeated failure to cure deficiencies by amend-\nments previously allowed, undue prejudice to \nthe opposing party by virtue of allowance of the \namendment, futility of amendment, etc. \u2014 the \nleave sought should, as the rules require, be \n\u201cfreely given.\u201d Of course, the grant or denial of \nan opportunity to amend is within the discre-\ntion of the District Court, but outright refusal to \n\n \n \n \n \n \n27 \n \ngrant the leave without any justifying reason \nappearing for the denial is not an exercise of dis-\ncretion; it is merely abuse of that discretion and \ninconsistent with the spirit of the Federal \nRules. \n371 U.S. at 182.3 See, e.g., United States v. Vorachek, \n563 F.2d 884, 887 (8th Cir. 1977) (vacatur necessary \ngiven Foman and Rule 15(a)).  \nThis Court has always balanced the finality of judg-\nments with the preference for giving plaintiffs \u201can op-\nportunity to test their claims on the merits.\u201d For ex-\nample, this Court \u201cbalance[d] the interests of the de-\nfendant protected by the statute of limitations with \nthe preference expressed in the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure in general, and Rule 15 in particular, for re-\nsolving disputes on their merits.\u201d Krupski, 560 U.S. at \n550. A statute of limitations embodies the value of fi-\nnality and repose, see, e.g., Lozano v. Alvarez, 572 U.S. \n1, 14 (2014), just as, in the Second Circuit, \u201cpostjudg-\nment motions generally place significant emphasis on \n \n3  \nBLOM argues that the circuit erred in relying on Foman \nbecause the vacatur motion in that case was treated as coming \nunder Rule 59(e), not Rule 60(b), and the two rules \u201cdiffer in ma-\nterial ways and impose different standards for relief by their own \nterms.\u201d Pet.Br.18, 34-35. As explained infra 31-32, any such dis-\ntinction does not help BLOM\u2014but it was also completely irrele-\nvant to this Court\u2019s analysis in Foman. The First Circuit had de-\ncided to treat the motion as \u201cfiled pursuant to Rule 59(e), rather \nthan under Rule 60(b)\u201d to resolve an unrelated procedural issue \ninvolving two notices of appeal. Foman v. Davis, 292 F.2d 85, 87 \n(1st Cir. 1961). This Court then noted that the \u201cCourt of Appeals\u2019 \ntreatment of the motion to vacate as one under Rule 59(e) was \npermissible, at least as an original matter, and we will accept \nthat characterization here.\u201d 371 U.S. at 181. It never suggested \nthat the \u201ccharacterization\u201d impacted its review or the vacatur \nstandards it applied.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n28 \n \nthe \u2018value of finality and repose,\u2019\u201d Williams, 659 F.3d \nat 213 (internal citation omitted).  \nThis Court has also always understood Rule 60(b) \nas accommodating that preference, rejecting argu-\nments that overemphasize finality at its expense. For \nexample: \u201c[T]he State reminds us of the importance of \npreserving the finality of judgments. But the \u2018whole \npurpose\u2019 of Rule 60(b) \u2018is to make an exception to final-\nity.\u2019\u201d Buck, 580 U.S. at 126 (citations omitted). BLOM \nrelies heavily on this Court\u2019s analysis of finality in \nGonzalez v. Crosby but omits its conclusion: \u201c[W]e give \nlittle weight to respondent\u2019s appeal to the virtues of \nfinality. That policy consideration, standing alone, is \nunpersuasive in the interpretation of a provision \nwhose whole purpose is to make an exception to final-\nity.\u201d 545 U.S. 524, 529 (2005). Likewise, BLOM quotes \nthis Court\u2019s admonition in United States v. Denedo \nthat \u201cjudgment finality is not to be lightly cast aside,\u201d \nPet.Br.27, but again leaves out the Court\u2019s conclusion: \n\u201cthe finality rule is not so inflexible that it trumps each \nand every competing consideration.\u201d 556 U.S. 904, 916 \n(2009). A \u201cjudgment\u201d based on the wrong reasons, due \nlargely to what the circuit itself concedes to have been \nits own \u201cambigu[ous]\u201d precedent, Pet.App.40 n.11, is \nto be \u201ccast aside\u201d in order to permit disposition on the \nmerits.  \nLike this Court, the Second Circuit rejects \u201ca stand-\nard that overemphasize[s] considerations of finality at \nthe expense of the liberal amendment policy embodied \nin the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\u201d Williams, 659 \nF.3d at 210. And like this Court, the Second Circuit \nholds that \u201cRule 60(b) relief is designed to afford par-\nties an opportunity to resolve a dispute on its merits.\u201d \nNemaizer v. Baker, 793 F.2d 58, 63 (2d Cir. 1986) (cit-\ning 7 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, \u00b6 60.19, at 156 (2d ed. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n29 \n \n1983)). That is, the policies underlying Rules 60(b) and \n15(a) work \u201cin tandem,\u201d as the Second Circuit ex-\nplained below. Pet.App.7. \nThe circuit courts have also consistently recognized \nthis balance inherent in Rule 60(b)(6). The rule\u2019s \u201c[ex-\ntraordinary circumstances] requirement exists in or-\nder to balance the broad language of Rule 60(b)(6), \nwhich allows courts to set aside judgments for \u2018any\u2019 \nreason justifying relief, with the interest in the finality \nof judgments.\u201d Budget Blinds, 536 F.3d at 255. The \nNinth Circuit sourced this principle to Gonzalez:  \nAs the Sixth Circuit rightly held when applying \nGonzalez, \u201cthe decision to grant Rule 60(b)(6) \nrelief is a case-by-case inquiry that requires the \ntrial court to intensively balance numerous fac-\ntors, including the competing policies of the fi-\nnality of judgments and the incessant command \nof the court\u2019s conscience that justice be done in \nlight of all the facts.\u201d  \nPhelps v. Alameida, 569 F.3d 1120, 1133 (9th Cir. \n2009) (quoting Stokes, 475 F.3d at 736). See also In re \nSpansion, Inc., 507 F. App\u2019x 125, 128 (3d Cir. 2012) \n(\u201cThe rule seeks \u2018to strike a proper balance between \nthe conflicting principles that litigation must be \nbrought to an end and that justice must be done.\u2019\u201d) (ci-\ntation omitted); Blue Diamond Coal Co. v. Trs. of the \nUMWA Combined Benefit Fund, 249 F.3d 519, 529 \n(6th Cir. 2001) (same); People for the Ethical Treat-\nment of Animals v. United States HHS, 901 F.3d 343, \n354-55 (D.C.

Miller & M.K. \nKane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2851 (2d ed. \n1995) (same). \nThe Eighth Circuit has held that district courts re-\nviewing post-judgment motions to amend under Rule \n59(e) or Rule 60(b) \u2018\u201cmay not ignore the Rule 15(a)(2) \nconsiderations that favor affording parties an oppor-\ntunity to test their claims on the merits . . . .\u2019\u201d Mask of \nKa-Nefer-Nefer, 752 F.3d at 743 (quoting United \nStates ex rel. Roop v. Hypoguard USA, Inc., 559 F.3d \n818, 823-24 (8th Cir. 2009)). Indeed, Moore\u2019s Federal \nPractice specifically notes that \u201c[t]he hybrid approach \nof the Second and Eighth Circuits strikes the correct \nbalance: it protects the strong interest in finality of \njudgments and the expeditious termination of litiga-\ntion, while allowing postjudgment amendment of \npleadings in a particular case if justice requires.\u201d 12 \nMoore\u2019s Federal Practice - Civil \u00a7 59.30. For that prop-\nosition, Moore\u2019s relies on two Rule 60(b)(6) cases\u2014Wil-\nliams and Mask of Ka-Nefer-Nefer. Id., \u00a7 59.30 n.9.1.3, \nn.9.1.4. \nThe Seventh Circuit gives even greater weight to \nRule 15 interests when the district court has entered \njudgment at the same time it dismisses a complaint: \nBecause Rules 59(e) and 60(b) are reserved for \nextraordinary cases, the Girl Scouts urge us to \napply a more demanding standard to post-judg-\nment motions to amend than we do to motions \nto amend filed prior to the entry of judgment. \n \n4  \nThe same is true for Rule 59(e), in which \u201c[t]he court must \nstrike the proper balance between two competing imperatives: (1) \nfinality, and (2) the need to render just decisions on the basis of \nall the facts.\u201d Edward H. Bohlin Co. v. Banning Co., 6 F.3d 350, \n355 (5th Cir. 1993). \n\n \n \n \n \n \n31 \n \nBut the extraordinary nature of these remedies \ndoes not mean that a different standard ap-\nplies\u2014at least when judgment was entered at \nthe same time the case was first dismissed. \nWhen the district court has taken the unusual \nstep of entering judgment at the same time it \ndismisses the complaint, the court need not find \nother extraordinary circumstances and must \nstill apply the liberal standard for amending \npleadings under Rule 15(a). \nRunnion v. Girl Scouts of Greater Chi. & Nw. Ind., 786 \nF.3d 510, 521 (7th Cir. 2015). See also NewSpin \nSports, Ltd. Liab. Co. v. Arrow Elecs., Inc., 910 F.3d \n293, 310 (7th Cir. 2018) (same). \nBLOM attempts to draw a distinction between \npost-judgment analyses under \u201cRules 59(e) and 60(b),\u201d \nrelying on Daulatzai v. Maryland, 97 F.4th 166 (4th \nCir. 2024). Pet.Br.34-35. But Daulatzai only held that \nunder Rule 59(e), a court should solely \u201capply the more \nspecific standard of Rule 15(a),\u201d and \u201cneed not concern \nitself\u201d with Rule 59(e)\u2019s other standards. 97 F.4th at \n177 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \nSee also Rosenzweig v. Azurix Corp., 332 F.3d 854, 864 \n(5th Cir. 2003) (\u201cthis Court has held that, under these \ncircumstances, the considerations for a Rule 59(e) mo-\ntion are governed by Rule 15(a)\u201d); Jang v. Bos. Sci. \nScimed, Inc., 729 F.3d 357, 368 (3d Cir. 2013) (\u201c[w]here \na timely motion to amend judgment is filed under Rule \n59(e), the Rule 15 and 59 inquiries turn on the same \nfactors.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omit-\nted); Allen v. Walmart Stores, L.L.C., 907 F.3d 170, \n184 (5th Cir. 2018) (same).5 Daulatzai unremarkably \n \n5  \nBLOM relies heavily on Banister v. Davis, 590 U.S. 504 \n(2020), but that case deals with what types of vacatur motions \ncount as a successive habeas application. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n32 \n \nheld that \u201cto obtain relief from a final judgment under \nRule 60(b), one of the six grounds enumerated must be \nsatisfied,\u201d including finding \u201cextraordinary circum-\nstances\u201d under Rule 60(b)(6). 97 F.4th at 178. The \nplaintiff failed to show \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d \nthere because she had already amended twice, and her \namendment \u201cefforts were pursued in bad faith.\u201d Id. at \n170. The extraordinary circumstances requirement is \nthe same in Metzler and Mandala (and in Runnion, \nwhich did find \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d).  \nIn sum, BLOM\u2019s claim that \u201cevery one of [the Sec-\nond Circuit\u2019s] sister Circuits\u201d disagrees with it is \nsimply wrong. Pet.Br.25. A number of BLOM\u2019s own \ncases recognize the need to balance competing policies \nin Rule 60(b). For example, in Leisure Caviar, LLC v. \nUnited States Fish & Wildlife Service, the Sixth Cir-\ncuit explained that while amendment should be \u201cfreely \nallowed,\u201d \u201cwhen a Rule 15 motion comes after a judg-\nment against the plaintiff,\u201d courts \u201cmust \u2018consider[] \nthe competing interest of protecting the finality of \njudgments\u201d; that is, \u201c[i]nstead of meeting only the \nmodest requirements of Rule 15, the claimant must \nmeet the requirements for reopening a case estab-\nlished by Rules 59 or 60.\u201d 616 F.3d 612, 615-16 (6th \nCir. 2010) (citations omitted) (emphases added). Like \nin Phelps, Leisure Caviar directs courts to balance the \n\u201ccompeting\u201d policies of Rule 15 and Rule 60.  \nAnd in Nation v. DOI, the Ninth Circuit explained \nthat \u201c[a]fter judgment . . . \u2018our policy of promoting the \nfinality of judgments\u2019 somewhat displaces Rule 15\u2019s \nopenhandedness,\u201d given Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s predicate of \nextraordinary circumstances. 876 F.3d 1144, 1173 (9th \nCir. 2017) (citation omitted) (emphasis added). That \ncase affirmed denial of post-judgment leave to amend \nbecause the plaintiff had already twice amended and \n\n \n \n \n \n \n33 \n \nfailed to identify how yet another amendment could \ncure its standing problem.  \nMost of BLOM\u2019s remaining cases simply note that \na judgment must be appealed or vacated before a com-\nplaint is amended or that Rule 15(a) does not alone \nprovide the analytical basis for vacatur\u2014but none dis-\npute that the Rule 15 principles could inform the ex-\nceptional circumstances analysis. See Rosenzweig, 332 \nF.3d at 864 (explaining that post-judgment amend-\nment requires appeal or vacatur); In re Ferro Corp. \nDerivative Litig., 511 F.3d 611, 624 (6th Cir. 2008) \n(same); Helm v. Resolution Tr. Corp., 84 F.3d 874, 879 \n(7th Cir. 1996) (same); Bldg. Indus. Ass\u2019n v. Norton, \n247 F.3d 1241, 1245 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (same); Boyd v. \nSecretary, 114 F.4th 1232, 1237 (11th Cir. 2024) \n(same). Indeed, in a case BLOM cites for the proposi-\ntion that \u201cthere is no pending complaint to amend\u201d \nonce \u201cthe action has been dismissed\u201d with prejudice, \nthe opinion noted that courts still apply \u201cRule 15 \nstandards\u201d to such vacatur motions. Calvary Christian \nCenter v. City of Fredericksburg, 710 F.3d 536, 540 \n(4th Cir. 2013). \nTo the extent that any of BLOM\u2019s cases can be read \nto suggest that Rule 15(a)\u2019s preference for determining \ncases on their merits plays no role in motions for post-\njudgment amendment, they are out of step with the \nother circuits. BLOM quotes Garrett v. Wexford \nHealth as holding that under Rule 60(b), \u201c[t]he permis-\nsive policy favoring amendment under Rule 15 was \nsimply not relevant.\u201d 938 F.3d 69, 86 (3d Cir. 2019). \nBut that case cited and relied on Leisure Caviar, 616 \nF.3d at 615-16, which requires courts to weigh the \n\u201ccompeting interests\u201d of Rules 15 and 60. The starker \nlanguage in Garrett was understandable as the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n34 \n \nplaintiff had already amended his complaint four \ntimes, clearly exhausting the policy of liberal amend-\nment.  \nUnsurprisingly, BLOM has selected cases where \nplaintiffs have thoroughly exhausted any chance to \namend. As noted above, Daulatzai involved a motion \nto file a fourth complaint, \u201cpursued in bad faith.\u201d 97 \nF.4th at 170. In James v. Watt, 716 F.2d 71, 77 (1st \nCir. 1983), the delay in amendment was \u201cstrategic.\u201d In \nIn re Ferro, the plaintiff did not have an actual amend-\nment in mind and needed discovery. 511 F.3d at 624. \nSee also Helm, 84 F.3d at 879 (\u201cinexcusable attorney \nnegligence\u201d); UMB Bank, N.A. v. Guerin, 89 F.4th \n1047, 1057-58 (8th Cir. 2024) (proposed second \namended complaint \u201crepeats . . . scandalous, logically \nirrelevant material\u201d and was futile) (internal quota-\ntion marks and citations omitted); Nation, 876 F.3d at \n1174 (plaintiff \u201camended its complaint twice before\u201d \ndismissal).  \nB. Rule 60(b)\u2019s Balancing Means Ensuring \nParties Have a Meaningful Opportunity \nto Amend Pleadings at Least Once, \nWhich Courts Broadly Support. \nIn the Second Circuit, the practical effect of the bal-\nancing inquiry for post-judgment motions to amend is \nfar less dramatic than BLOM suggests: \u201cIn the post-\njudgment context, we have indeed given \u2018due regard\u2019 \nto \u2018the liberal spirit of Rule 15\u2019 by ensuring plaintiffs \nat least one opportunity to replead.\u201d Metzler, 970 F.3d \nat 146 (quoting Williams, 659 F.3d at 213-14). See also \nMandala, 88 F.4th at 362 (same). If the plaintiff has \nhad a meaningful chance to amend, dismissal is no \nlonger extraordinary:  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n35 \n \nIn most if not all Second Circuit cases denying \npost-judgment leave to replead, the plaintiff \nhad already taken at least one shot at amend-\nment. This makes sense: when a plaintiff al-\nready had multiple chances to state a claim, \nthere is little risk of manifest injustice in deny-\ning yet another go. \nId. (citations omitted). \nBut a chance to state a claim is only meaningful if \nthe claimant has been fairly instructed in the correct \nlegal standard, either by a ruling of the district court \nor by clear precedent. Such a ruling identifies actual \nand remediable defects in the complaint, if any. See, \ne.g., United States ex rel. Customs Fraud Investiga-\ntions, LLC v. Victaulic Co., 839 F.3d 242, 250 (3d Cir. \n2016) (observing that without a ruling, \u201ca plaintiff is \nunlikely to know whether his complaint is actually de-\nficient\u2014and in need of revision\u201d); Tate v. SCR Med. \nTransp., 809 F.3d 343, 346 (7th Cir. 2015) (\u201cthe court \nshould grant leave to amend after dismissal of the first \ncomplaint \u2018unless it is certain from the face of the com-\nplaint that any amendment would be futile or other-\nwise unwarranted\u2019\u201d) (citation omitted); United States \nex rel. Lee v. Corinthian Colls., 655 F.3d 984, 998 (9th \nCir. 2011) (\u201c[plaintiffs] should have at least one oppor-\ntunity to add any such facts to the Complaint\u201d); Fire-\nstone v. Firestone, 76 F.3d 1205, 1208 (D.C. Cir. 1996) \n(similar). The Second Circuit noted that it is an \u201cim-\npropriety\u201d to deny amendment \u201cwithout the benefit of \na ruling,\u201d as that presents plaintiffs with a \u201cHobson\u2019s \nchoice: agree to cure deficiencies not yet fully briefed \nand decided or forfeit the opportunity to replead.\u201d Lo-\nreley Fin. (Jersey) No. 3 Ltd. v. Wells Fargo Sec., LLC, \n797 F.3d 160, 190 (2d Cir. 2015). \n\n \n \n \n \n \n36 \n \nOrdinarily, entering judgment dismissing a case \nwithout the opportunity to amend is an abuse of dis-\ncretion. See supra 30-31 (quoting Runnion, 786 F.3d at \n521). See also Jack v. Evonik Corp., 79 F.4th 547, 565 \n(5th Cir. 2023) (\u201cPlaintiffs should usually be able to \namend at least once, because \u2018fairness requires\u2019 it.\u201d) \n(citation omitted). In such case, \u201c[t]he district court left \nthe plaintiff with little recourse but to file a motion \nunder Rules 59(e) and 60(b) . . . .\u201d Foster v. DeLuca, \n545 F.3d 582, 584 (7th Cir. 2008).  \nIn fact, Plaintiffs\u2019 motion here would have come un-\nder Rule 59(e), which BLOM\u2019s cases suggest are eval-\nuated under Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal standards only, see \nsupra 31-32\u2014if not for the necessity of appealing the \ndistrict court\u2019s erroneous and essentially impossible \npleading standards first. See Mask of Ka-Nefer-Nefer, \n752 F.3d at 743 (explaining that appealing is \u201cthe \nproper recourse\u201d where a dismissal decision is wrong). \nAs the Seventh Circuit explained, \u201ca plaintiff who re-\nceives a Rule 12(b)(6) motion and who has good reason \nto think the complaint is sufficient may also choose to \nstand on the complaint and insist on a decision with-\nout losing the benefit of the well-established liberal \nstandard for amendment with leave of court under \nRule 15(a)(2).\u201d Runnion, 786 F.3d at 523. \nOf course, that entailed a risk\u2014Plaintiffs could \nhave been wrong on appeal. If the Second Circuit had \naffirmed the district court\u2019s reasoning (and not just \noutcome), that would not be an \u201cexceptional circum-\nstance\u201d\u2014that happens routinely and when it does, a \nplaintiff may have made a \u201cfree, calculated, [and] de-\nliberate choice\u201d not to take advantage of any prior op-\nportunities to amend. The circuit\u2019s affirmance on other \ngrounds here was thus fortuitous for BLOM\u2014but that \n\n \n \n \n \n \n37 \n \ndoes not justify elevating finality over the interests of \njustice. \nThis is why BLOM is compelled to argue that the \nSecond Circuit really affirmed dismissal of the case on \nthe same \u201cgrounds\u201d the district court used. Pet.Br.40. \nBut the district court acknowledged its dismissal was \nonly affirmed \u201con other grounds.\u201d Pet.App.10. The Sec-\nond Circuit\u2019s ground for affirmance involved one of the \nsame elements (knowledge), but for a fundamentally \ndifferent reason: the (original and still only) complaint \nrelied too much on \u201cpublicly available evidence\u201d rather \nthan \u201cpublic sources\u201d of information identifying \nBLOM\u2019s customers as Hamas-affiliated entities, and \nits allegation of the latter was too \u201climited.\u201d \nPet.App.51. \nThat the pleading standard was clarified on appeal \nis grounds to permit amendment, not deny it. For ex-\nample, in Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., \nthis Court explained that \u201c[w]hile we reject the Sev-\nenth Circuit\u2019s approach . . . we do not decide whether, \nunder the standard we have described . . . the Share-\nholders\u2019 allegations\u201d are sufficient. Because the lower \ncourts lacked \u201cthe opportunity to consider the matter \nin light of the prescriptions we announce today,\u201d the \nCourt vacated judgment \u201cso that the case may be reex-\namined in accord with our construction . . . .\u201d 551 U.S. \n308, 329 (2007). And after clarifying the Rule 8 plead-\ning standard in Ashcroft v. Iqbal, this Court ordered \nthat \u201c[t]he Court of Appeals should decide in the first \ninstance whether to remand to the District Court so \nthat respondent can seek leave to amend his deficient \ncomplaint.\u201d 556 U.S. 662, 687 (2009). See also Johnson \nv. City of Shelby, 574 U.S. 10, 12 (2014) (reversing dis-\nmissal with instructions to permit amendment if nec-\nessary). See also Marranzano v. Riggs Nat\u2019l Bank, 184 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n38 \n \nF.2d 349, 351 (D.C. Cir. 1950) (where a decision is \u201caf-\nfirmed\u201d but \u201cbased on an incorrect ground,\u201d the \u201cends \nof justice\u201d require \u201can opportunity to amend [the] com-\nplaint\u201d); Oil, Chem. & Atomic Workers Int\u2019l Union v. \nDelta Ref. Co., 277 F.2d 694, 697 (6th Cir. 1960) \n(where \u201cthe views which we have expressed give the \ncase a somewhat different aspect than it had under the \ntrial court\u2019s ruling,\u201d amendment is appropriate).  \nAfter the Second Circuit affirmed dismissal on \nother grounds in Honickman II, it left Plaintiffs the \nchoice of whether to move for post-judgment leave to \namend, if they thought they had the allegations to do \nso. But as is clear from the subsequent summary order \nbelow remanding the case for further consideration, \nthat affirmance was not intended to preclude Plain-\ntiffs from seeking an opportunity to amend.  \nII. \nThe Second Circuit Did Not Find Waiver, \nand Thus Did Not Alter the Vacatur Stand-\nard in Its Summary Order \nBLOM\u2019s argument hangs on the straw man that \nthe Second Circuit agreed that Plaintiffs \u201cconsistently \nand consciously rejected numerous invitations and op-\nportunities to amend,\u201d but nevertheless \u201cdirected dis-\ntrict courts to override and rescue parties from their \n\u2018free, calculated, [and] deliberate choices.\u2019\u201d Pet.Br.28-\n29 (citations omitted). Although BLOM pressed this \nargument to the circuit below, see BLOM Brief, No. 22-\n1039, Dkt. No. 42, at 1-2, 41-43, the circuit did not find \nany such waiver. To the contrary, it found that the dis-\ntrict court applied a \u201cwrong standard\u201d that was un-\nmeetable. As Judge Wesley asked BLOM\u2019s counsel \nduring the oral argument below, \u201cWhat are [Plaintiffs] \nsupposed to do? They know they can\u2019t amend [to] \n. . . meet\u201d the standard BLOM urged and the district \ncourt adopted. Notably, BLOM does not challenge the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n39 \n \nSecond Circuit\u2019s findings as to waiver in its question \npresented here. \nNevertheless, BLOM attempts to muster evidence \nof occasions when Plaintiffs forfeited opportunities to \namend. The first two \u201copportunities\u201d were the district \ncourt\u2019s invitations to amend before issuing its dismis-\nsal decision. But these opportunities were not mean-\ningful because they offered only to amend in conform-\nity with the incorrect legal standards BLOM urged, \ngiving Plaintiffs no notice of defects under the correct \nlegal standard. See, e.g., Bryant v. Dupree, 252 F.3d \n1161, 1164 (11th Cir. 2001) (\u201cit cannot be said that the \nplaintiffs failed to correct defects of which they had no-\ntice\u201d) (emphasis added). There is no forfeiture where \n\u201cDefendants did not [identify] below\u201d and \u201cthe district \ncourt itself did not rely on the deficiencies we have \nidentified in dismissing\u201d a plaintiff\u2019s claims\u2014espe-\ncially where \u201cthe district court\u2019s reasoning meant that \nno such amendments would remedy the defects that \nthe district court perceived.\u201d Charles Schwab Corp. v. \nBank of Am. Corp., 883 F.3d 68, 89-90 (2d Cir. 2018).  \nAgain, even the district court here acknowledged \nthat its dismissal decision was only affirmed \u201con other \ngrounds.\u201d Pet.App.10. BLOM notes that Plaintiffs \ncould have added some useful additional allegations in \ntheir proposed amended complaint before appealing, \nbut it would have been futile to do so given that Plain-\ntiffs would still have failed to meet each of the district \ncourt\u2019s (erroneous) standards.  \nIndeed, if declining these pre-judgment \u201copportuni-\nties\u201d to amend constituted waiver, litigants would be \ncompelled to file serial (futile) amendments and re-\nbrief Rule 12(b) motions simply to preserve their \nrights to amend post-appeal, which would hardly im-\nprove the efficiency of the lower federal courts or lead \n\n \n \n \n \n \n40 \n \nto more equitable outcomes. Likewise, a rule that dis-\nincentives bringing valid cases \u201cwhere the law [i]s re-\nally recasting itself\u201d in the circuit courts, as Judge \nWesley observed it was here, Oral Arg. at 13:23-38, \ndoes not promote the interests of justice. \nBLOM faults Plaintiffs for not moving for vacatur-\nfor-amendment instead of appealing, or not appealing \nthe with-prejudice nature of the dismissal. Pet.Br.11. \nPlaintiffs did not seek vacatur before appealing be-\ncause there is \u201cno reason\u201d to \u201cfile a post-judgment mo-\ntion seeking leave to amend\u201d where \u201cthe district \ncourt\u2019s reasoning meant that no such amendments \nwould remedy the defects that the district court per-\nceived.\u201d Charles Schwab, 883 F.3d at 90. Again, \u201cthe \nproper recourse when [a party] disagreed with the dis-\ntrict court\u2019s interpretation of the . . . statute was a di-\nrect appeal, not a Rule 60(b) motion.\u201d Mask of Ka-\nNefer-Nefer, 752 F.3d at 743. And Plaintiffs did not \nappeal the \u201cwith-prejudice\u201d component of the dismis-\nsal decision because leave to amend would not have \naltered the result without the circuit first correcting \nthe district court\u2019s legal errors.  \nFinally, BLOM also faults Plaintiffs for not asking \nthe circuit court for leave to amend in their post-argu-\nment supplemental brief in Honickman II. Pet.Br.11. \nThough asking the circuit for leave to amend is per-\nmissible, in the Second Circuit, post-judgment leave to \namend is generally a decision for the district court to \nmake \u201cin the first instance.\u201d Iqbal v. Ashcroft, 574 F.3d \n820, 822 (2d Cir. 2009).6 The circuit court\u2019s job is to \n \n6  \nBLOM also faults Plaintiffs for \u201cnot seek[ing] rehearing,\u201d \nPet.Br.12, but in the Mandala dissent BLOM relies on, Judge Sul-\nlivan criticized precisely that: \u201c[r]ather than seek vacatur and \nleave to amend\u201d after the first appeal, \u201cPlaintiffs instead opted to \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n41 \n \nassess the district court\u2019s ruling\u2014it goes without say-\ning that if a viable amendment is necessary, plaintiffs \nwill want to make it. The summary order demon-\nstrates that the circuit court did not find a need for \nPlaintiffs to have requested leave to amend from the \nfirst panel (Judge Wesley was on both unanimous pan-\nels). \nIII. \nThe Balancing Inquiry Does Not Conflict \nwith the Text of Any of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure. \nBLOM argues that the Second Circuit\u2019s precedent \nconflicts with the plain text of Rule 15(a) and Rule \n60(b). To do so, it erroneously construes the Second \nCircuit\u2019s basis for remand as \u201callow[ing] plaintiffs to \nleapfrog over \u2018Rule 60(b)\u2019s finality gauntlet\u2019 to the \nsanctuary of \u2018Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal repleading policy.\u2019\u201d \nPet.Br.30. Again, the Second Circuit directs district \ncourts to balance Rule 60(b)\u2019s finality and Rule 15(a)\u2019s \nliberality \u201cin tandem,\u201d Pet.App.7; it does not permit \n\u201cleapfrogging.\u201d See Meltzer, 970 F.3d at 146 (finding \nthe \u201cargument that the [post-judgment] motion is gov-\nerned solely by the legal standard applicable to Rule \n15(a)(2) motions . . . without merit.\u201d). \nTo establish a textual conflict, BLOM argues that \nRule 15(a) \u201capplies only to \u2018Amendments Before \nTrial,\u2019\u201d and \u201c[i]t is in that setting . . . that the Rules \nencourage courts to \u2018freely give leave\u2019 to amend.\u201d \nPet.Br.30. Thus, BLOM suggests, Rule 15\u2019s preference \n \nfile a petition for rehearing en banc\u2014a strategic choice that \nplainly undermines any argument that some aspect of the district \ncourt\u2019s order was an \u2018extraordinary circumstance\u2019 preventing \nPlaintiffs from pursuing their claims.\u201d 88 F.4th at 368. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n42 \n \nfor deciding cases on their merits is entirely extin-\nguished at judgment.  \nBut Rule 15 contemplates two stages of amend-\nment\u2014before trial and during or after trial. Both in-\nvolve \u201cfreely\u201d giving leave to amend, under certain cir-\ncumstances which depend on trial, not judgment. See \nRule 15(a)(2), Rule 15(b)(1). The rule has no higher \nstandard. \nIndeed, \n\u201c\u2018[a]mendments \nunder \n[Rule \n15(a)(2)] may be made at any stage of the litigation.\u2019 \nGranting leave to amend after summary judgment is \nthus allowed at the discretion of the trial court.\u201d Ngu-\nyen v. United States, 792 F.2d 1500, 1502 (9th Cir. \n1986) (quoting 6 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Prac-\ntice and Procedure \u00a7 1484 (1971)). See also Dussouy v. \nGulf Coast Inv. Corp., 660 F.2d 594, 598 (5th Cir. \n1981) (applying Rule 15 and noting that \u201c[i]nstances \nabound in which appellate courts on review have re-\nquired that leave to amend be granted after dismissal \nor entry of judgment\u201d). \nObviously, this case was not dismissed after trial\u2014\nit was dismissed following an initial Rule 12(b)(6) mo-\ntion, before Plaintiffs had the opportunity to try to \ncure any actual defects in their complaint. That is pre-\ncisely the context that Rule 15(a) squarely addresses. \nEntering judgment does not eliminate Rule 15(a)\u2019s \npreference for \u201cresolving disputes on their merits.\u201d \nKrupski, 560 U.S. at 550. \nBLOM argues that Rule 15(a) \u201cdoes not provide a \nmechanism for amending pleadings after dismissal,\u201d \nPet.Br.30, but that is likewise irrelevant. To the extent \nRule 60(b)(6) provides the \u201cmechanism,\u201d it is an \u201cex-\nception to finality\u201d for \u201cany reason that justifies relief.\u201d \nGranting leave to amend \u201cwhen justice so requires,\u201d as \nRule 15(a) commands, presumably informs the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n43 \n \nreasons that \u201cjustify relief\u201d under Rule 60(b)(6)\u2014in-\ncluding providing an opportunity to amend at least \nonce.7  \nBLOM asserts that the Second Circuit\u2019s \u201cbalancing \ntest\u201d conflicts with the rest of Rule 60(b) because it \nwould permit plaintiffs to \u201cevade those explicit time \nlimitations in\u201d Rule 60(b)(1) (relief given mistake or \nexcusable neglect) and Rule 60(b)(2) (relief given new \nevidence). Pet.Br.31-33. But the Second Circuit has \nnever suggested that vacatur and amendment are per-\nmissible where a complaint failed due to counsel\u2019s mis-\ntake or where a plaintiff simply wants to present new \nevidence over a year after judgment. Instead, a district \ncourt\u2019s failure to give plaintiffs at least one meaningful \nopportunity to replead may constitute extraordinary \ncircumstances, and vacatur and amendment may be \nappropriate.  \nIn Mandala, the Second Circuit determined which \nprovision of Rule 60(b) applied before turning to the \npolicies and standards of either Rule 60(b) or Rule \n15(a): \u201cProper characterization of Plaintiffs\u2019 Rule 60(b) \nmotion is a threshold issue because, as previously ex-\nplained, [Rule 60(b)\u2019s] provisions are subject to differ-\nent filing limitations . . . .\u201d 88 F.4th at 359. The Second \nCircuit determined that Rule 60(b)(6) was the proper \nrule because \u201cinsufficient pleading is not categorically \na \u2018mistake,\u2019 and Plaintiffs\u2019 belief that their Complaint \nsatisfied the standards for pleading a disparate impact \nclaim was well-founded, even if ultimately erroneous.\u201d \nId. \n \n7  \nBLOM contends that this Court should read Rule 60(b) \nwith Rule 1, not Rule 15(a). Pet.Br.35-38. But Rule 1 does not \nnegate Rule 15\u2014to the extent Rule 1 provides any guidance here, \nit is its command to secure the \u201cjust\u201d outcome. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n44 \n \nNor does the decision below conflict with Rule \n60(b)(2), which only permits vacatur to introduce (1) \nnewly discovered evidence (2) within a year of judg-\nment. The Second Circuit does not permit post-judg-\nment amendments \u201cbased on previously omitted alle-\ngations,\u201d as BLOM asserts (or evidence discovered \nover a year after judgment). Pet.Br.33. In fact, Metzler \nrejected an attempt to circumvent Rule 60(b)(2)\u2019s \n\u201cnewly discovered evidence standard.\u201d 970 F.3d at 146. \nThat case still required a showing of extraordinary cir-\ncumstances under Rule 60(b)(6). BLOM points out \nthat movants might introduce allegations they could \nhave presented before, Pet.Br.33, but Rule 60(b) gives \nreasons for vacating a judgment\u2014it does not limit \nwhat a party can include in an amended pleading once \nvacatur and leave to amend are granted. \nTo be clear, BLOM no longer appears to contest \nthat Rule 60(b)(6) applies in this case. The district \ncourt itself found that Rule 60(b)(6) applied here, not-\ning that \u201cnone of [the other provisions] are applicable\u201d \nto Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for vacatur. Pet.App.12. BLOM \ndid nevertheless argue to the panel below that Rule \n60(b)(1) applied, but the circuit did not accept the ar-\ngument, assessing the case under Rule 60(b)(6). See \nPet.App.6-7. BLOM did not challenge the district \ncourt\u2019s or circuit court\u2019s application of Rule 60(b)(6) in \nits petition for certiorari or in their merits brief to this \nCourt. \nIV. \nExtraordinary Circumstances Are Present \nHere Because After Honickman II Clarified \nthe Previously \u201cAmbigu[ous]\u201d Legal Stand-\nards, Plaintiffs Were Denied Any Oppor-\ntunity to Meet Them. \nAs this Court has explained, \u201c[i]n determining \nwhether extraordinary circumstances are present \n\n \n \n \n \n \n45 \n \n[under Rule 60(b)(6)], a court may consider a wide \nrange of factors,\u201d including \u201c\u2018the risk of injustice to the \nparties\u2019 and \u2018the risk of undermining the public\u2019s con-\nfidence in the judicial process.\u2019\u201d Buck, 580 U.S. at 123 \n(quoting Liljeberg, 486 U.S. at 864). In Mandala, the \nSecond Circuit noted several factors in that case that \nestablished exceptional circumstances for purposes of \na motion for post-judgment amendment: \n[1] Plaintiffs have yet to be afforded a single op-\nportunity to amend their pleading; [2] the orig-\ninal dismissal of the Complaint was premised \non grounds subject to reasonable, actual, and \nvigorous debate; [3] Plaintiffs diligently prose-\ncuted their case at all times; and [4] Plaintiffs\u2019 \nproposed amendments address the sole plead-\ning deficiency identified by the district court.  \n88 F.4th at 365.  \nPlaintiffs meet all of these factors here. Denying \nPlaintiffs leave to amend risks injustice, as they may \nlose their only opportunity to have this case decided on \nthe merits, as the statute of limitations has run on \ntheir claims. See LeBlanc v. Cleveland, 248 F.3d 95, \n101 (2d Cir. 2001) (finding \u201c\u2018extraordinary circum-\nstances\u2019 under Rule 60(b)(6), because [plaintiff] would \nbe left without a remedy if the motion [for vacatur and \nleave to amend] were not granted\u201d). And where the \ncase is at its earliest stage, with no discovery con-\nducted, the prejudice to BLOM is limited solely to \nbriefing a new motion to dismiss against allegations \ntailored to meet the legal standards articulated by the \nSecond Circuit and this Court in Taamneh. The poten-\ntial burden of re-briefing a motion to dismiss is already \nbuilt into Rules 15(a)(1) and (2) and is not the kind of \nprejudice that the Rule considers. See, e.g., Patton v. \nGuyer, 443 F.2d 79, 86 (10th Cir. 1971) (\u201cThere is \n\n \n \n \n \n \n46 \n \ninvariably some practical prejudice resulting from an \namendment, but this is not the test for refusal of an \namendment. . . . The defendants were not prejudiced \nin terms of preparing their defense to the amend-\nment.\u201d). \nIndeed, courts have applied more liberal standards \nto motions for post-judgment amendment at early \nstages in the litigation. For example, the Fifth Circuit \nheld that \u201cthe Rule 15 standards apply when a party \nseeks to amend a judgment that has been entered \nbased on the pleadings,\u201d but doubted whether those \nstandards would apply \u201cafter trial.\u201d S. Constructors \nGrp. v. Dynalectric Co., 2 F.3d 606, 611 (5th Cir. 1993). \nSee also Duggins v. Steak \u2018n Shake, Inc., 195 F.3d 828, \n834 (6th Cir. 1999) (holding that amendment risks sig-\nnificant prejudice \u201cafter the close of discovery\u201d); Ru-\notolo v. City of N.Y., 514 F.3d 184, 187, 192 (2d Cir. \n2008) (similar).  \nPlaintiffs have also yet to be afforded a single \nmeaningful opportunity to amend their complaint; the \nbasis for the original dismissal of the complaint was \nnot merely open to \u201cvigorous debate,\u201d Mandala, 88 \nF.4th at 365, but entirely incorrect; Plaintiffs dili-\ngently prosecuted their case, appealing and moving for \nvacatur expeditiously; and Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed amend-\nments could address the actual defects in the com-\nplaint that the Second Circuit identified.  \nBLOM argues that no extraordinary circumstances \nare present here because (1) the district court\u2019s deci-\nsion was affirmed on the same grounds it provided; (2) \nPlaintiffs waived any \u201cright\u201d to an amendment be-\ncause they did not take the district court\u2019s invitations \nto amend; (3) even if the district court was wrong, a \nclarification or change in law is not an extraordinary \ncircumstance; and (4) Plaintiffs are at \u201cfault\u201d for \n\n \n \n \n \n \n47 \n \nfailing to amend or delaying doing so. Pet.Br.39-45. \nThe first two reasons are addressed above: the dismis-\nsal decision was premised on \u201cthe wrong legal stand-\nard,\u201d and the Second Circuit did not find that Plaintiffs \n\u201cwaived\u201d any meaningful opportunities to amend.  \nBLOM asserts that \u201cmere clarification of the law is \nnot extraordinary,\u201d as it \u201cis what appellate courts do \nday in and day out\u201d\u2014and, in fact, \u201cthis Court has held \nthat even an outright change in the law does not war-\nrant relief under Rule 60(b)(6).\u201d Pet.Br.19 (citing Gon-\nzalez, 545 U.S. at 537). But in Gonzalez, the change in \nlaw was made in another case after the case under re-\nview was decided, leading this Court to remark: \u201c[i]t is \nhardly extraordinary that subsequently, after peti-\ntioner\u2019s case was no longer pending, this Court arrived \nat a different interpretation.\u201d 545 U.S. at 537. Moreo-\nver, Mr. Gonzalez failed to show sufficient diligence \nbecause he did not \u201cseek review of the District Court\u2019s \ndecision\u201d on the issue relating to his vacatur motion. \nId.  \nHere the \u201cclarification\u201d came in the same case, as a \nresult of Plaintiffs\u2019 appeal. See Charles Schwab, 883 \nF.3d at 89-90. The Second Circuit \u201cacknowledge[d] the \ndistrict court\u2019s decision came before our opinion \nin Kaplan [II] clarified the import of our earlier \nJASTA aiding-and-abetting precedents which may \nhave generated some ambiguity as to the proper \nstandard.\u201d Pet.App.40 n.11. It is manifestly unfair to \nexpect Plaintiffs to fully understand a set of legal \nstandards that were still being \u201crecast[],\u201d Oral Arg. at \n13:23-38, when the district court could not. \nBLOM argues in the alternative that if the Second \nCircuit\u2019s clarification was \u201cin line with [Plaintiffs\u2019] \nown interpretation\u201d of JASTA, Plaintiffs \u201cnever \u2018ex-\nplain[ed] why they did not allege facts sufficient to \n\n \n \n \n \n \n48 \n \nsatisfy the standard for which they were advocating.\u2019\u201d \nPet.Br.41 (quoting Pet.App.17 n.5). But while Plain-\ntiffs were indeed broadly correct about JASTA\u2019s plead-\ning standards\u2014a fact that BLOM argues somehow \ncounts against them\u2014they could not anticipate the ev-\nidentiary distinction newly articulated by the Second \nCircuit between \u201cpublicly available evidence\u201d and \n\u201cpublic sources.\u201d \nIn fact, this Court has held that even a change in \nlaw in another case can constitute extraordinary cir-\ncumstances. See Kemp v. United States, 596 U.S. 528, \n540 (2022) (noting \u201cthe availability of Rule 60(b)(6) to \nreopen a judgment in extraordinary circumstances, in-\ncluding a change in controlling law\u201d and citing cases) \n(Sotomayor, J., concurring). For example, a change in \nlaw relating to the same incident justified reversing a \nthree-year-old denial of certiorari, because \u201cthe inter-\nest in finality of litigation must yield where the inter-\nests of justice would make unfair the strict application \nof our rules\u201d\u2014another recitation of the balancing test. \nGondeck v. Pan Am. World Airways, Inc., 382 U.S. 25, \n26-28 (1965). The Tenth Circuit also found such a \nchange in law in another case an \u201cextraordinary situ-\nation justifying Rule 60(b)(6) relief.\u201d Pierce v. Cook & \nCo., 518 F.2d 720, 723-24 (10th Cir. 1975) (en banc). \nThe interests of justice and demands of fairness are \neven more pronounced when the relevant \u201cchange in \nlaw\u201d occurs in the same case.  \nPetitioner\u2019s fourth waiver argument is wrong as \nwell: unlike BLOM\u2019s cases rejecting post-judgment \namendments that were strategically delayed like \nJames and Rozensweig, Plaintiffs here are not at any \n\u201cfault\u201d and did not engage in any \u201cgamesmanship.\u201d \nPet.Br.27, 33, 36, 44. They timely appealed the district \ncourt\u2019s incorrect dismissal decision and, once \u201c[a]rmed \n\n \n \n \n \n \n49 \n \nwith [the Second Circuit\u2019s] clarifications,\u201d promptly \nmoved for vacatur and leave to amend. There was no \n\u201cundue delay\u201d\u2014although \u201cdelay alone, regardless of \nits length is not enough to bar [amendment] if the \nother party is not prejudiced.\u201d Moore v. Paducah, 790 \nF.2d 557, 560 (6th Cir. 1986) (quoting 3 Moore\u2019s Fed-\neral Practice, para. 15.08 at 15.76). As explained \nabove, BLOM would not be unduly prejudiced by vaca-\ntur and amendment here. \nCONCLUSION \nBLOM quotes extensively from Ackermann v. \nUnited States to argue that \u201c\u2018[t]here must be an end to \nlitigation someday . . . .\u201d Pet.Br.1, 29 (quoting 340 U.S. \n193, 198 (1950)). BLOM\u2019s comparison of Ackermann to \nthis case is illustrative of its arguments generally. In \nAckermann, the petitioners sought vacatur four years \nafter judgments were entered following a trial, in or-\nder to bring an extremely late appeal. This case has \nnever even entered discovery. See Dubicz v. Common-\nwealth Edison Co., 377 F.3d 787, 793 n.1 (7th Cir. \n2004) (\u201cIt is important to emphasize that this litiga-\ntion has never progressed beyond the pleadings stage. \nThis is not the case where a plaintiff seeks to amend \nits complaint after the close of discovery or on the eve \nof trial.\u201d). Plaintiffs did file a timely and necessary ap-\npeal. Dismissal here is hardly what this Court in \nAckermann meant by \u201csomeday.\u201d \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be af-\nfirmed and the case should be remanded for further \nproceedings.  \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n50 \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \n \nMichael Radine \n Counsel of Record \nGary M.

For the task, this synthesis is necessary to understand the core legal tension between judgment finality and liberal pleading standards, identify the nature of the circuit split, and formulate a hypothesis about how the Court might resolve it. This directly moves the agent from data collection to legal analysis, significantly improving its ability to make a prediction. For the design, this action tests the fundamental 'search-synthesize-plan' loop. Evaluating the outcome of this thinking process provides strong evidence for the importance of interleaving information gathering with structured reflection, a core principle for any effective reasoning agent. It helps refine the strategy of when and how to pause to make sense of accumulated data before proceeding, preventing inefficient or redundant future actions.",

It confirms the agent understands the 'how' of legal prediction, which is a core aspect of its design.\n\nJoint EIG (1.3): The action is highly valuable overall.

As those precedents make clear, obtaining \nrelief from a final judgment under Rule 60(b)(6) \n\u201crequires a showing of \u2018extraordinary circumstances.\u2019\u201d  \nGonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524, 536 (2005).  And \nthose circumstances must demonstrate \u201cthat the \n[moving] party is faultless.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. \nBrunswick Assocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship, 507 U.S. 380, 393 \n(1993).  After all, \u201c[t]here must be an end to litigation \nsomeday, and free, calculated, deliberate choices are \nnot to be relieved from.\u201d  Ackermann v. United States, \n340 U.S. 193, 198 (1950). \nIt could hardly be otherwise.  Our adversarial \nsystem of civil justice could not function without a \nscrupulous regard for the conclusiveness of judgments \nprofessing to settle the parties\u2019 rights.  Courts have \nrecognized that fundamental precept since the \nFounding.  Consistent with that history and tradition, \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure afford district \ncourts the power to revisit a final judgment through \nRule 60(b) only in \u201ca limited set of circumstances.\u201d  \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. at 528.  And they strictly prohibit \na party from moving for such relief more than a year \nafter judgment if that party is even \u201cpartly to blame \nfor the delay.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs., 507 U.S. at 393; see \nFed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1), (c)(1).  \nFor decades, lower courts have faithfully applied \nthese well-settled principles of judgment finality.  And \nthey have uniformly rejected attempts by plaintiffs to \navoid Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent requirements by \n\n2 \n \nappealing to Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policy.  \nIndeed, the two inquiries are entirely separate.  Rule \n15(a) applies before trial and judgment, while Rule 60 \napplies after a final judgment.  Accordingly, \u201cif a \nplaintiff seeks to reopen a case under Rule 60(b) in \norder to file an amended complaint, she must satisfy \none of the Rule 60(b) grounds\u201d and have the judgment \nset aside \u201cbefore a court may consider her motion to \namend.\u201d  Daulatzai v. Maryland, 97 F.4th 166, 178 \n(4th Cir. 2024).  As the Fourth Circuit aptly put it \nearlier this year, adopting a contrary rule would have \nplaced it \u201calone in the Nation in collapsing the Rule \n60(b) standard with the standard for Rule 15(a).\u201d  Id. \nat 177. \nBut the decision below did just that\u2014in a case \nwhere Respondents repeatedly declined to amend \ntheir complaint in the normal course.  By rejecting the \nDistrict Court\u2019s multiple invitations to amend their \ncomplaint, Respondents deliberately chose to proceed \non that complaint as pled and take their chances on a \nmotion to dismiss.  The District Court eventually \ndismissed the complaint with prejudice, and the \nSecond Circuit affirmed the dismissal after full merits \nbriefing, oral argument, and supplemental briefing.  \nAt no time during those proceedings did Respondents \nseek leave to amend.   \nThen, more than 18 months after the dismissal \nwith prejudice\u2014and after that dismissal was affirmed \non appeal\u2014Respondents filed a Rule 60(b)(6) motion \nto vacate the judgment so they could restart the \nprocess and try again with an amended complaint.  \nThe District Court rejected that effort by properly \napplying Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent standard.  It \n\n3 \n \nemphasized that Respondents had \u201cnot demonstrated \nany extraordinary circumstances\u201d and had engaged in \na \u201cseries of deliberate choices not to cure the \ndeficiencies identified in their pleading by [Petitioner] \nand th[e] Court.\u201d  Pet.App.14, 19.  The District Court \ntherefore permissibly exercised its discretion to deny \nRespondents\u2019 motion. \nThe \nSecond \nCircuit \nnevertheless \nreversed.  \nApplying an atextual balancing test adopted by a split \npanel in Mandala v. NTT Data, Inc., 88 F.4th 353 (2d \nCir. 2023), the Second Circuit held that the District \nCourt abused its discretion by failing to \u201cgive \u2018due \nregard\u2019 to \u2018both the philosophy favoring finality of \njudgments . . . and the liberal amendment policy of \nRule 15(a).\u2019\u201d  Pet.App.7 (alteration in original) \n(quoting Mandala, 88 F.4th at 361).  In the Second \nCircuit\u2019s view, district courts are \u201crequired to consider \nRule 60(b) finality and Rule 15(a) liberality in tandem\u201d \nwhen plaintiffs seek to reopen a judgment in order to \nfile an amended complaint.  Id.  It thus faulted the \nDistrict Court for analyzing Respondents\u2019 Rule 60(b) \nmotion \u201cunder only Rule 60(b)\u2019s standard.\u201d  Id.   \nThat reasoning is indefensible.  The Second \nCircuit\u2019s outlier balancing test effectively rewrites the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.  It destroys the \nfinality principles embodied in Rule 60(b).  It \nencourages wasteful and pernicious litigation tactics.  \nIt imbues uncertainty.  And it contravenes this Court\u2019s \nprecedents at every turn.  This Court should reverse. \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe District Court\u2019s opinion dismissing the case \nwith prejudice on January 14, 2020 is reported at 432 \nF.

Crosby, 545 U.S. 524, \n535 (2005) (quoting Ackermann v. United States, 340 \nU.S. 193, 199 (1950)).  This Court has also stressed \nthat a movant must be \u201cfaultless\u201d to obtain relief.  \nPioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. Brunswick Assocs. Ltd. \nP\u2019ship, 507 U.S. 380, 393 (1993).  \u201cThis very strict \ninterpretation of Rule 60(b) is essential if the finality \nof judgments is to be preserved.\u201d  Gonzalez, 545 U.S. \nat 535 (citation omitted).  In this case, Respondents \ndeclined multiple invitations and opportunities to \namend their complaint.  The District Court then \ndismissed their complaint with prejudice, and the \nSecond Circuit affirmed.  Only then did Respondents \nask the District Court to vacate the judgment so they \ncould file an amended complaint that would include \npreviously available facts.  The District Court denied \nthe \nmotion \nunder \nRule \n60(b)(6)\u2019s \nwell-settled \nstandard.  But the Second Circuit reversed, based on \nan anomalous \u201cbalanc[ing]\u201d test that requires district \ncourts to heed Rule 15(a)\u2019s \u201cliberal pleading principles\u201d \nwhen addressing a Rule 60(b)(6) motion to reopen a \nfinal judgment for the purpose of filing an amended \ncomplaint. \nThe question presented is: \nWhether Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent standard applies \nto a post-judgment request to vacate for the purpose of \nfiling an amended complaint. \n \n\nii \n \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nPetitioner BLOM Bank SAL was defendant in the \nUnited States District Court for the Eastern District \nof New York and appellee in the United States Court \nof Appeals for the Second Circuit.  \nRespondents Michal Honickman, Individually and \nfor the Estate of Howard Goldstein, Eugene \nGoldstein, Lorraine Goldstein, Richard Goldstein, \nBarbara Goldstein Ingardia, Michael Goldstein, \nChana Freedman, David Goldstein, Moses Strauss, \nPhilip Strauss, Bluma Strauss, Ahron Strauss, Roisie \nEngelman, Joseph Strauss, Tzvi Weiss, Leib Weiss, \nIndividually and for the Estate of Malka Weiss, \nYitzchak Weiss, Yeruchaim Weiss, Esther Deutsch, \nMatanya Nathansen, Individually and for the Estate \nof Tehilla Nathansen, Chana Nathansen, Individually \nand for the Estate of Tehilla Nathansen, Yehudit \nNathansen, S.N., a minor, Hezekial Toporowitch, \nPearl B.

Crosby, 545 U.S. 524, 536 (2005).  And \nthose circumstances must demonstrate \u201cthat the \n[moving] party is faultless.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. \nBrunswick Assocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship, 507 U.S. 380, 393 \n(1993).  After all, \u201c[t]here must be an end to litigation \nsomeday, and free, calculated, deliberate choices are \nnot to be relieved from.\u201d  Ackermann v. United States, \n340 U.S. 193, 198 (1950). \nIt could hardly be otherwise.  Our adversarial \nsystem of civil justice could not function without a \nscrupulous regard for the conclusiveness of judgments \nprofessing to settle the parties\u2019 rights.  Courts have \nrecognized that fundamental precept since the \nFounding.  Consistent with that history and tradition, \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure afford district \ncourts the power to revisit a final judgment through \nRule 60(b) only in \u201ca limited set of circumstances.\u201d  \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. at 528.  And they strictly prohibit \na party from moving for such relief more than a year \nafter judgment if that party is even \u201cpartly to blame \nfor the delay.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs., 507 U.S. at 393; see \nFed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1), (c)(1).  \nFor decades, lower courts have faithfully applied \nthese well-settled principles of judgment finality.  And \nthey have uniformly rejected attempts by plaintiffs to \navoid Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent requirements by \n\n2 \n \nappealing to Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policy.  \nIndeed, the two inquiries are entirely separate.  Rule \n15(a) applies before trial and judgment, while Rule 60 \napplies after a final judgment.  Accordingly, \u201cif a \nplaintiff seeks to reopen a case under Rule 60(b) in \norder to file an amended complaint, she must satisfy \none of the Rule 60(b) grounds\u201d and have the judgment \nset aside \u201cbefore a court may consider her motion to \namend.\u201d  Daulatzai v. Maryland, 97 F.4th 166, 178 \n(4th Cir. 2024).  As the Fourth Circuit aptly put it \nearlier this year, adopting a contrary rule would have \nplaced it \u201calone in the Nation in collapsing the Rule \n60(b) standard with the standard for Rule 15(a).\u201d  Id. \nat 177. \nBut the decision below did just that\u2014in a case \nwhere Respondents repeatedly declined to amend \ntheir complaint in the normal course.  By rejecting the \nDistrict Court\u2019s multiple invitations to amend their \ncomplaint, Respondents deliberately chose to proceed \non that complaint as pled and take their chances on a \nmotion to dismiss.  The District Court eventually \ndismissed the complaint with prejudice, and the \nSecond Circuit affirmed the dismissal after full merits \nbriefing, oral argument, and supplemental briefing.  \nAt no time during those proceedings did Respondents \nseek leave to amend.   \nThen, more than 18 months after the dismissal \nwith prejudice\u2014and after that dismissal was affirmed \non appeal\u2014Respondents filed a Rule 60(b)(6) motion \nto vacate the judgment so they could restart the \nprocess and try again with an amended complaint.  \nThe District Court rejected that effort by properly \napplying Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent standard.  It \n\n3 \n \nemphasized that Respondents had \u201cnot demonstrated \nany extraordinary circumstances\u201d and had engaged in \na \u201cseries of deliberate choices not to cure the \ndeficiencies identified in their pleading by [Petitioner] \nand th[e] Court.\u201d  Pet.App.14, 19.  The District Court \ntherefore permissibly exercised its discretion to deny \nRespondents\u2019 motion. \nThe \nSecond \nCircuit \nnevertheless \nreversed.  \nApplying an atextual balancing test adopted by a split \npanel in Mandala v. NTT Data, Inc., 88 F.4th 353 (2d \nCir. 2023), the Second Circuit held that the District \nCourt abused its discretion by failing to \u201cgive \u2018due \nregard\u2019 to \u2018both the philosophy favoring finality of \njudgments . . . and the liberal amendment policy of \nRule 15(a).\u2019\u201d  Pet.App.7 (alteration in original) \n(quoting Mandala, 88 F.4th at 361).  In the Second \nCircuit\u2019s view, district courts are \u201crequired to consider \nRule 60(b) finality and Rule 15(a) liberality in tandem\u201d \nwhen plaintiffs seek to reopen a judgment in order to \nfile an amended complaint.  Id.  It thus faulted the \nDistrict Court for analyzing Respondents\u2019 Rule 60(b) \nmotion \u201cunder only Rule 60(b)\u2019s standard.\u201d  Id.   \nThat reasoning is indefensible.  The Second \nCircuit\u2019s outlier balancing test effectively rewrites the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.  It destroys the \nfinality principles embodied in Rule 60(b).  It \nencourages wasteful and pernicious litigation tactics.  \nIt imbues uncertainty.  And it contravenes this Court\u2019s \nprecedents at every turn.  This Court should reverse. \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe District Court\u2019s opinion dismissing the case \nwith prejudice on January 14, 2020 is reported at 432 \nF.

The petition for writ of certiorari was timely \nfiled on May 29, 2024, and granted on October 4, 2024.  \nThis Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nFEDERAL RULES INVOLVED \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) governs \nmotions for \u201cRelief from a Final Judgment.\u201d  It \nprovides five specific grounds for relief.  See Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 60(b)(1)-(5).  Rule 60(b)(6) then states that \u201cthe \ncourt may relieve a party or its legal representative \nfrom a final judgment, order, or proceeding for . . . any \nother reason that justifies relief.\u201d \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a) governs \n\u201cAmendments Before Trial.\u201d  Rule 15(a)(2) provides \nthat \u201ca party may amend its pleading only with the \nopposing party\u2019s written consent or the court\u2019s leave.  \nThe court should freely give leave when justice so \nrequires.\u201d \n\n5 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. The Initial District Court Proceedings \nRespondents filed this lawsuit on January 1, 2019, \na day before the statute of limitations expired and \nnearly sixteen years after the latest of the events in \nquestion.  JA.1; see Pub. L. No. 112-239, \u00a7 1251(c), 126 \nStat. 1632, 2017-18 (2013) (extending the ordinary \nlimitations period for certain Anti-Terrorism Act \nclaims to January 2, 2019).  Respondents are victims \nand the families of victims of terrorist attacks carried \nout by Hamas between December 1, 2001, and August \n19, 2003.  JA.7-81.  As Petitioner explained in the \nproceedings below, it categorically abhors terrorism, it \nhas no connection to Hamas, and it is not legally or \nfactually \nresponsible \nfor \nRespondents\u2019 \ninjuries.  \nJA.160-62, 168-72.1   \nThe complaint accuses Petitioner of aiding and \nabetting those attacks through a daisy chain of \nspeculation.  In particular, Respondents allege that \n \n1  Respondents have filed almost a dozen more lawsuits \nagainst other defendants in the nearly sixteen years following the \nattacks, all seeking damages for the same injuries alleged here.  \nSee Kirschenbaum v. Islamic Repub. of Iran, No. 1:03-cv-01708-\nRCL (D.D.C.); Sokolow v. Palestine Liberation Org., No. 1:04-cv-\n00397-GBD-RLE (S.D.N.Y); Linde v. Arab Bank, PLC, No. 1:04-\ncv-02799-BMC-PK (E.D.N.Y.); Wolf v. Credit Lyonnais, S.A., No. \n07-cv-00914 (E.D.N.Y.); Applebaum v. Nat\u2019l Westminster Bank, \nPLC, No. 1:07-cv-00916-DLI-RML (E.D.N.Y.); Beer v. ASSA \nCorp., No. 1:13-cv-01848-LAP (S.D.N.Y.); Singer v. Bank of \nPalestine, No. 1:19-cv-00006-ENV-RML (E.D.N.Y.); Averbach v. \nCairo Amman Bank, No. 1:19-cv-00004-GHW-KHP (S.D.N.Y.); \nMiller v. Credit Lyonnais, S.A., No. 1:19-cv-00002-DLI-RML \n(E.D.N.Y.); Miller v. Nat\u2019l Westminster Bank, PLC, 1:19-cv-00001-\nDLI-RML (E.D.N.Y.); Spetner v. Palestine Inv. Bank, No. 1:19-cv-\n00005-EK-JAM (E.D.N.Y.). \n\n6 \n \nPetitioner provided routine financial services to three \ncustomers:  Sanabil, Subul al-Khair, and Union of \nGood (together, the \u201cThree Customers\u201d).  JA.106, 116, \n120.  Though the Complaint spans 645 paragraphs, it \nsays relatively little about the Three Customers (or \nPetitioner).  See generally JA.1-122.  In fact, none of \nthe Three Customers was itself alleged to have \nengaged in acts of terrorism.  Instead, \u201cthe Three \nCustomers were alleged only to have supported \norphans in Palestinian refugee camps.\u201d  Pet.App.52 \nn.21.   \nRespondents pled their claim under the Anti-\nTerrorism Act (\u201cATA\u201d), as amended by the Justice \nAgainst Sponsors of Terrorism Act (\u201cJASTA\u201d).  JA.121-\n22.  Under the ATA, a United States national \u201cinjured \nin his or her person, property, or business by reason of \nan act of international terrorism, or his or her estate, \nsurvivors, or heirs, may sue therefor in any \nappropriate district court of the United States.\u201d  18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2333(a).  JASTA provides for secondary \nliability against \u201cany person who aids and abets, by \nknowingly providing substantial assistance, or who \nconspires with the person who committed such an act \nof international terrorism.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 2333(d)(2).   \nTo impose secondary liability, JASTA requires \u201cthat \nthe defendant consciously and culpably \u2018participated\u2019 \nin a wrongful act so as to help \u2018make it succeed.\u2019\u201d  \nTwitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, 598 U.S. 471, 493 (2023) \n(alteration adopted) (quoting Nye & Nissen v. United \nStates, 326 U.S. 613, 619 (1949)).  And \u201cJASTA further \nrestricts secondary liability by requiring that the \u2018act \nof international terrorism\u2019 be \u2018committed, planned, or \nauthorized by\u2019 a foreign terrorist organization \n\n7 \n \ndesignated as such \u2018as of the date on which such act of \ninternational terrorism was committed, planned, or \nauthorized.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 495 (quoting 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2333(d)(2)).  Thus, \u201cit is not enough\u201d that a \ndefendant has \u201cgiven substantial assistance to a \ntranscendent \u2018enterprise\u2019 separate from and floating \nabove all the actionable wrongs that constitute it.\u201d  Id.  \n\u201cRather, a defendant must have aided and abetted (by \nknowingly providing substantial assistance) another \nperson in the commission of the actionable wrong\u2014\nhere, an act of international terrorism.\u201d  Id.  \nUnder JASTA, one of the three elements for aiding-\nand-abetting liability is that \u201cthe defendant must be \ngenerally aware of his role as part of an overall illegal \nor tortious activity at the time that he provides the \nassistance.\u201d  Id. at 486 (emphasis added) (quoting \nHalberstam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472, 477 (D.C. Cir. \n1983)).  Accordingly, to state a claim, Respondents \nneeded to plausibly allege that Petitioner was aware \nof a link between the Three Customers and Hamas \u201cat \nthe time\u201d Petitioner allegedly provided services to \nthem.  Id. (citation omitted).  But they failed to do so, \neven though their complaint was filed more than \nfifteen years after the latest of the attacks.  \nPetitioner made this point clearly and repeatedly \nthroughout the proceedings below.  Before moving to \ndismiss, Petitioner submitted a three-page letter \nsummarizing the grounds for its contemplated motion, \nas required by the District Court\u2019s Individual \nPractices.  JA.142-47.  Petitioner\u2019s lead argument was \nthat the complaint did not plausibly allege the general \nawareness element necessary to state their JASTA \n\n8 \n \nclaim.  JA.144.2  This argument, in turn, relied on the \ncomplaint\u2019s failure to allege that Petitioner was aware \nof any connection between the Three Customers and \nHamas before the attacks\u2014that is, by August 19, \n2003.  JA.145.  The complaint acknowledged that the \nThree Customers \u201cengaged in actual charitable work.\u201d  \nJA.143.  They were only \u201clater linked to Hamas.\u201d  Id.   \nIn response to this letter, Respondents chose not to \namend.  See JA.148-55.  They instead stood on the \nallegations in their complaint.  See id. \nAt a pre-motion conference, the District Court \nasked Respondents\u2019 counsel: \u201cAre there any additional \nfacts you could add to the allegations that the \ndefendant is challenging here or are you comfortable \nstanding on your complaint as it is?\u201d  Pet.App.93 \n(emphasis added).  Respondents\u2019 counsel declined the \nCourt\u2019s invitation: \u201cNo, I think we are prepared to \nbrief it based on the arguments presented in the pre-\nmotion letter.\u201d  Id.  The Court then asked whether \nRespondents would seek leave to amend if the Court \ngranted \nPetitioner\u2019s \nmotion \nto \ndismiss. \n \nId.  \nRespondents\u2019 counsel unequivocally stated that they \n\u201cwould not seek leave to amend.\u201d  Pet.App.94. \nAfter the conference, the District Court issued an \norder memorializing the fact that the court \u201coffered \n[Respondents] \nan \nopportunity \nto \namend \ntheir \n \n2  Petitioner also argued that Respondents failed to plausibly \nallege the knowing provision of substantial assistance to the \nalleged terrorist activities or any facts suggesting that \nPetitioner\u2019s routine banking services directly assisted the acts \nthat caused Respondents\u2019 injuries.  JA.145-47; see also Twitter, \n598 U.S. at 506 (summarizing principles of aiding-and-abetting \nliability under JASTA). \n\n9 \n \ncomplaint\u201d to \u201cadd additional information in response \nto the arguments raised by [Petitioner],\u201d but they \n\u201cdeclined to do so and represented that they would not \nbe seeking to amend their Complaint in this regard.\u201d  \nJA.156.  Respondents stuck to that position, and they \ndid not seek leave to amend their complaint. \nA few weeks later, Petitioner moved to dismiss \nconsistent with its pre-motion letter.  JA.159.  Among \nother arguments, it reiterated that the complaint \nfailed to plausibly allege that Petitioner knew of the \nThree Customers\u2019 purported affiliation with Hamas \nbefore the alleged attacks.  JA.160-61, 174-85.  \nRespondents opposed that motion and, in doing so, \nonce again stood on their papers.  JA.197-241.  They \ndid not move to amend or ask for an opportunity to \nreplead \nshould \nthe \nDistrict \nCourt \nfind \ntheir \nallegations lacking. \nThe District Court then held oral argument.  \nPet.App.100.  There, Petitioner\u2019s counsel again \nemphasized the complaint\u2019s failure to connect the \nThree Customers to Hamas \u201cat the time of any of the \nattacks.\u201d  Pet.App.109.  \u201cAt the very most, what the \ncomplaint alleges is that BLOM provided financial \nservices to three entities, two of which were later \ndetermined by the [U.S.] government to have provided \nfinancial support to [Hamas].\u201d  Pet.App.108 (emphasis \nadded). \nThe District Court pressed Respondents\u2019 counsel \non this pleading deficiency, asking \u201c[w]here do you \nallege in your complaint that BLOM Bank knew that \nthese account holders are alter egos or are a part of, or \nthe same as [Hamas]?\u201d  Pet.App.121.  The District \nCourt then offered Respondents\u2019 counsel yet another \n\n10 \n \nopportunity to amend the complaint, specifically with \nrespect to Petitioner\u2019s alleged \u201cknowledge\u201d: \nThe Court: I do recall that you did not want an \nopportunity to try to replead . . . . And I think \nthe Second Circuit may not encourage district \ncourts to allow another round of pleading if \nthere\u2019s been a declination of an opportunity to \nreplead . . . . So everything I need to consider in \nterms of sufficiency of your pleading is going to \nbe found in the complaint that\u2019s filed in this \ncase, correct? \nMr. Radine: Yes, Your Honor.  The\u2014 \nThe Court: There are no facts that you would \nhave to offer to address some of the contentions \nof \nthe \ndefendants \nregarding \nknowledge, \nespecially? \nMr. Radine: I think we could always add \nallegations, but the\u2014we believe the complaint \ngoes far enough in saying that BLOM . . . was \ngenerally aware of its role in th[e] [il]licit \nconduct . . . . \nPet.App.124-25 (emphasis added). \nThe District Court granted Petitioner\u2019s motion to \ndismiss, holding in relevant part that Respondents \nhad not \u201cplausibly allege[d] that [Petitioner] was \ngenerally aware of any connection between the Three \nCustomers and Hamas\u201d \u201cat the time it provided \nfinancial \nservices \nto \nthe \nThree \nCustomers.\u201d  \nPet.App.73-75.   \nThe court noted that it \u201ctypically grants plaintiffs \nan opportunity to amend their complaints following \ndismissal, to address any deficiencies raised by the \n\n11 \n \nCourt\u2019s order.\u201d  Pet.App.85.  However, Respondents \nhere \u201c[did] not request leave to amend, and specifically \ndeclined the Court\u2019s offer to do so.\u201d  Id.  Accordingly, \n\u201c[i]n \nlight \nof \n[Respondents\u2019] \nrejection \nof \nthe \nopportunity to amend their pleading at the pre-motion \nconference, and the fact that they ha[d] not identified \nany additional facts they could allege which would \naddress the deficiencies in their complaint,\u201d the \nDistrict Court dismissed the complaint with prejudice.  \nPet.App.86.   \nB. Respondents\u2019 Initial Appeal to the Second \nCircuit \nRather than request leave to amend or file a Rule \n59(e) \nmotion \nfor \nreconsideration, \nRespondents \nappealed.  In that appeal, they did not challenge the \nDistrict Court\u2019s decision to dismiss without leave to \namend.  Pet.App.16 n.4.  They instead doubled down \non their argument that their existing allegations were \nenough to \u201cstate a claim to relief that is plausible on \nits face.\u201d  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) \n(citation omitted).   \nAfter oral argument, the Second Circuit held the \nappeal in abeyance pending its decision in Kaplan v. \nLebanese Canadian Bank, SAL, 999 F.3d 842 (2d Cir. \n2021).  It also ordered the parties to submit \nsupplemental briefs addressing the significance of \nthat decision.  JA.257-58.  At this point, Respondents \nhad yet another opportunity to ask the appellate court \nto remand or grant them leave to amend in light of the \nKaplan decision.  Once again, though, they did \nneither.  They instead relied on their complaint as pled \nand insisted that the allegations therein stated a \nclaim.  JA.259-81.   \n\n12 \n \nThe Second Circuit affirmed the District Court\u2019s \ndismissal because the complaint\u2019s \u201callegations [did] \nnot support an inference that [Petitioner] was aware \nof the Three Customers\u2019 ties with Hamas prior to the \nrelevant attacks.\u201d  Pet.App.49.  Respondents did not \nseek rehearing.  Nor did they belatedly request that \nthe Second Circuit modify its decision to remand and \npermit Respondents leave to amend the complaint. \nC. The Post-Judgment Proceedings \nRespondents instead returned to the District Court \nand moved to vacate the District Court\u2019s now-affirmed \njudgment under Rule 60(b)(6) so they could amend \ntheir complaint and return to square one.  JA.315-22.  \nThe District Court held a pre-motion conference, at \nwhich it ordered briefing \u201conly as to the issue of \nvacatur.\u201d  JA.509.   \nAfter briefing, the District Court held that \n\u201c[Respondents] \nhave \nnot \ndemonstrated \nany \nextraordinary circumstances warranting relief under \nRule 60(b)(6).\u201d  Pet.App.14.  It also explained that \nRespondents had not demonstrated that they would \nsuffer an \u201cextreme and undue hardship\u201d from letting \nthe judgment stand because they \u201chave had ample \nopportunity to pursue all legal avenues available to \nthem for relief.\u201d  Pet.App.15-16 (quotation marks \nomitted).  \u201cFundamentally, [Respondents] seek to \namend their complaint after declining two prior \nopportunities to do so, and after unsuccessfully \nappealing the dismissal of that complaint with \nprejudice.\u201d  Pet.App.16.  And they sought to start the \nprocess all over again on the sole basis that they \nwished to plead new facts that were previously \navailable.  Pet.App.15.  The District Court thus \n\n13 \n \ndecided, in its discretion, to leave the final judgment \nin place given Respondents\u2019 \u201cdocumented series of \ndeliberate choices not to cure the deficiencies \nidentified in their pleading by [Petitioner] and [the \nDistrict] Court.\u201d  Pet.App.19.  \nRespondents appealed again.  Petitioner defended \nthe District Court\u2019s ruling by arguing that Rule \n60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent standards governed Respondents\u2019 \nmotion, that Rule 15(a) had no role to play in that \nanalysis, and that Respondents fell far short of \ndemonstrating \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d given \ntheir many earlier refusals to seek leave to amend.  \nSee 2d Cir. Dkt. No. 42, at 37-49, 55-59.  After oral \nargument, the Second Circuit issued its decision in \nMandala, 88 F.4th 353.   \nIn Mandala, a split panel held that, when a losing \nparty seeks post-judgment relief under Rule 60(b)(6) \nto amend its complaint, a district court must balance \nRule 60(b)(6)\u2019s finality principles with Rule 15(a)(2)\u2019s \n\u201cliberal amendment policy.\u201d  Id. at 361 (quoting \nWilliams v. Citigroup Inc., 659 F.3d 208, 213 (2d Cir. \n2011) (per curiam)).  And, where a losing party has not \nyet filed an amended complaint, the Second Circuit \nheld that it is an abuse of discretion for a district court \nto deny a Rule 60(b)(6) motion based solely on the \nmovant\u2019s \u201cfailure to demonstrate adequate grounds for \nrelief under Rule 60.\u201d  Id. at 362 & n.5.  In doing so, \nthe court flipped the burden from Rule 60 movants \n(who \nnormally \nmust \nprove \nextraordinary \ncircumstances) to their opponent (to show that the \nmovant should not receive another bite at the apple).  \nAs Judge Sullivan explained in dissent, that defies \n\u201cthe principle that Rule 60(b)(6) affords litigants an \n\n14 \n \nextraordinary remedy and effectively holds that such \nrelief is available in the ordinary course.\u201d  Id. at 368 \n(Sullivan, J., dissenting).  Judge Sullivan also \nexplained that the Second Circuit\u2019s approach \u201cerode[s] \nthe finality of judgments,\u201d \u201csignificantly undermine[s] \nthe important purposes served by Rule 60(b),\u201d and \n\u201cincrease[s] the workload of busy district court judges \nwho carry the heaviest burden in our system of civil \njustice.\u201d  Id. at 369. \nThe Second Circuit then applied and reaffirmed \nMandala\u2019s balancing test in the decision below.  It held \nthat \u201cthe district court exceeded its discretion by \nbasing its ruling on an erroneous view of the law \nbecause it failed to balance Rule 60(b)\u2019s finality \nprinciples \nand \nRule \n15(a)\u2019s \nliberal \npleading \nprinciples.\u201d  Pet.App.7-8.  When presented with a \nmotion to vacate for the purposes of amendment, the \nSecond Circuit said, \u201cthe district court is required to \nconsider Rule 60(b) finality and Rule 15(a) liberality \nin tandem.\u201d  Pet.App.7.  Thus, the Second Circuit held \nthat the District Court abused its discretion because it \nanalyzed the Rule 60(b) motion here \u201cunder only Rule \n60(b)\u2019s standard.\u201d  Id. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s outlier approach contradicts \nthe text, structure, and history of the Federal Rules, \nand it violates decades of this Court\u2019s precedents.  It \njettisons Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s well-settled and exacting \n\u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d \nstandard \nfor \na \nnebulous balancing test that wrongly smuggles Rule \n15(a)\u2019s \u201cliberal pleading principles\u201d into the calculus \nfor vacating a final judgment.  The decision below \nshould therefore be reversed, and the District Court\u2019s \n\n15 \n \ndenial of Respondents\u2019 Rule 60(b)(6) motion should be \nreinstated so this case can finally come to an end. \nI.  A party seeking to set aside an affirmed \njudgment for the purpose of filing an amended \ncomplaint must first satisfy Rule 60(b)\u2019s stringent \nstandards for vacating the judgment.  That common-\nsense position has been adopted by every other Court \nof Appeals.  And the Second Circuit\u2019s contrary \nbalancing approach is fundamentally mistaken. \nA.  Rule 60(b) imposes an intentionally high hurdle \nfor relief\u2014and understandably so.  This Court has \nlong underscored the profound importance of finality \nto our civil justice system.  After all, litigants, courts, \nand the public alike all share an interest in the \nconclusiveness of judgments and the peace and repose \nthat such finality brings.  Courts since the Founding \nhave thus consistently refused to reopen matters that \nhave been litigated to final judgment\u2014except in the \nmost compelling circumstances. \nRule 60(b) is rooted in that tradition.  It codified \nmany of the narrow, common-law exceptions for relief \nfrom a final judgment, along with a catchall in Rule \n60(b)(6) for similarly extraordinary circumstances \nthat are not explicitly covered by subsections \n(1) through (5).  Rule 60(b) therefore demands a \nscrupulous regard for finality.  Indeed, this Court has \nrepeatedly emphasized that Rule 60(b)(6) requires \n\u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d to justify vacating a \nfinal judgment.  See, e.g., Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 536. \nThat is the standard that applies here.  Rule 60(b) \nprovides the exclusive mechanism for \u201cRelief from a \nFinal Judgment\u201d more than 28 days after entry.  And \nRule 15(a) has no place in that inquiry.  Instead, Rule \n\n16 \n \n15(a) is limited to \u201cAmendments Before Trial.\u201d  There \nis not even a pending complaint to amend when an \naction has been finally dismissed with prejudice.  The \nsuit is over, and the claim is extinguished by the \ndoctrine of res judicata. \nAccordingly, plaintiffs cannot reopen a final \njudgment by invoking Rule 15(a)\u2019s policies without \nfirst meeting Rule 60(b)\u2019s restrictive standards.  And \nwhere, as here, plaintiffs seek relief under Rule \n60(b)(6), \nthey \nmust \nshow \n\u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d not covered by any other provision of \nRule 60(b).  To hold otherwise would enable plaintiffs \nto sidestep Rule 60(b)\u2019s deliberately narrow grounds \nfor post-judgment relief and thwart the Rule\u2019s respect \nfor finality. \nB.  Moreover, this Court has long held that a party \nmust be \u201cfaultless\u201d to obtain relief under Rule 60(b)(6).  \nPioneer Inv. Servs., 507 U.S. at 393; see Ackermann, \n340 U.S. at 197-202.  That is because Rule 60(b)(1) \nspecifically authorizes motions for relief premised on \n\u201cmistake, \ninadvertence, \nsurprise, \nor \nexcusable \nneglect,\u201d while strictly limiting the window for \nbringing such a motion to one year after judgment.  \nRule 60(b)(6) cannot be used to circumvent those \nlimitations.  If it could, then Rule 60(b)\u2019s provision for \n\u201cexcusable neglect\u201d would become superfluous. \nNor can Rule 60(b)(6) be used to circumvent basic \nprinciples of waiver.  That has been firmly settled by \nthis Court for decades.  See Ackermann, 340 U.S. at \n197-98.  Accordingly, where a plaintiff deliberately \nwaives the right to amend its complaint in the \nordinary course, it cannot seek a mulligan post-\n\n17 \n \njudgment after that considered choice has led to a \ndismissal with prejudice. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s outlier approach nullifies \nthese foundational principles.  Rather than requiring \nthe moving party to be faultless, the Second Circuit \nhas crafted a muddled balancing test that saves \nplaintiffs from their own litigation choices.  And the \ncourt has eschewed finality even where\u2014as here\u2014the \nmoving parties repeatedly and explicitly declined to \namend their complaint before judgment.  \nC.  The Second Circuit provided no persuasive \njustification for its balancing test.   \n1. It never even attempted to ground its analysis \nin the text of the Federal Rules.  In fact, as noted \nabove, its approach is at odds with the text and context \nof both Rule 15(a) and Rule 60(b). \n2. Moreover, by diluting Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s standard \nwith Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal repleading policy, the Second \nCircuit rendered Rule 60(b) internally inconsistent in \nat least three ways.  First, its balancing test enables \nplaintiffs to evade the one-year limitations period for \nRule 60(b) motions premised on \u201cexcusable neglect,\u201d \nby compelling district courts to reopen final judgments \noutside that timeframe based on previously omitted \nallegations.  Second, it thwarts the time limits for Rule \n60(b) motions premised on \u201cmistake\u201d of law or fact that \noccurred in the initial proceedings.  Third, it allows \nparties to reopen proceedings based on factual \nallegations they could have made pre-judgment\u2014even \nthough Rule 60(b)(2) specifically limits relief based on \nnew facts to those that could not have been previously \ndiscovered through due diligence.  \n\n18 \n \n3. The Second Circuit\u2019s test finds no support in \nprecedent either.  The decision below relied on Foman \nv. Davis, 371 U.S. 178 (1962).  But Foman is \ninapposite.  That case involved a Rule 59(e) motion, \nwhile this case concerns a Rule 60(b) motion.  There is \nno reason to conflate the standards for those two rules.  \nRules 59(e) and 60(b) differ in material ways and \nimpose different standards for relief by their own \nterms.  So this Court has refused to treat Rule 59(e) \nand Rule 60(b) motions as fungible.  See Banister v. \nDavis, 590 U.S. 504, 517-21 (2020). \n4. Finally, \neven \nif \nany \ninterpretive \ndoubt \nremained, this Court must \u201cconstrue[]\u201d the Rules to \n\u201csecure \nthe \njust, \nspeedy, \nand \ninexpensive \ndetermination of every action.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 1.  Far \nfrom advancing these overarching objectives, the \nSecond Circuit\u2019s test destroys them.  It allows the \nreopening of final judgments after plaintiffs have \nwillingly induced the judiciary to render a final \njudgment (and here an appellate ruling) based on their \noperative pleadings.  It thus invites a wasteful \nfeedback loop of relitigation.  As this case shows, that \napproach is neither just nor speedy nor inexpensive.   \nAt bottom, the Second Circuit erred in collapsing \nthe Rule 15(a) and Rule 60(b) inquiries.  The two rules \npose distinct hurdles.  The former applies before final \njudgment, and the latter applies after final judgment.  \nAs a result, Respondents could not seek leave to \namend unless they first proved \u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d beyond their control that would justify \nthe reopening of the final judgment dismissing their \ncase, which had already been affirmed on appeal. \n\n19 \n \nII. Respondents came nowhere close to meeting \nthat stringent standard\u2014and the District Court \ncertainly did not abuse its discretion in so finding. \nA.  There are no extraordinary circumstances here.  \nRespondents do not dispute that their late-breaking \nallegations were previously available to them.  They \nmerely argue that the Second Circuit \u201cclarified\u201d the \npleading standard for JASTA claims in their appeal.  \nBut the Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal with \nprejudice because\u2014as the District Court recognized\u2014\nRespondents failed to plausibly allege that Petitioner \nknew of the Three Customers\u2019 supposed connection to \nHamas at the time it allegedly provided routine \nbanking services to them.  And, in all events, mere \nclarification of the law is not extraordinary.  It is what \nappellate courts do day in and day out.  Indeed, this \nCourt has held that even an outright change in the law \ndoes not warrant relief under Rule 60(b)(6).  See \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. at 537.  The District Court thus did \nnot abuse its discretion in finding a lack of \nextraordinary circumstances. \nB.  On the contrary, the District Court would have \nnecessarily abused its discretion had it granted \nRespondents\u2019 motion.  This Court has made clear that \nit is an abuse of discretion to override a party\u2019s \ndeliberate waiver.  Here, Respondents waived or \nforfeited multiple opportunities to amend their \ncomplaint.  They first explicitly rejected the District \nCourt\u2019s invitation to amend at the pre-motion \nconference, after Petitioner had already pointed out \nthe \ndeficiencies \nin \nRespondents\u2019 \npleadings.  \nRespondents again rebuffed the District Court\u2019s \ninvitation to amend at oral argument.  They declined \n\n20 \n \nto file a Rule 59(e) motion to ask the District Court for \na chance to replead after they lost.  They chose not to \nappeal the \u201cwith prejudice\u201d component of the District \nCourt\u2019s dismissal.  And they never asked the Second \nCircuit for leave to replead if the court found their \nallegations lacking\u2014not in their opening brief, not in \ntheir reply brief, not at oral argument, and not in their \nsupplemental brief.   \nRespondents were thus far from faultless in the \ndelay.  Their own deliberate choices created the \ncircumstances from which they now seek relief.  Rule \n60(b)(6) does not save them from those strategic and \n\u201cvoluntary\u201d decisions.  Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 200.  \nGiven their repeated waivers of the chance to amend, \nRespondents could not even satisfy the more forgiving \nstandard for relief under Rule 59(e). \nFor all these reasons, this Court should reverse the \ndecision below and render judgment for Petitioner. \nARGUMENT \nI. A Party Seeking To Vacate A Final Judgment \nFor Purposes Of Amendment Must First \nSatisfy Rule 60(b). \nRelying on a series of Second Circuit precedents, \nthe decision below held that the District Court abused \nits discretion by \u201crequiring Plaintiffs to successfully \nnavigate Rule 60(b)\u2019s finality gauntlet before they \ncould invoke Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal repleading policy.\u201d  \nPet.App.8.  That, however, is precisely what the \nDistrict Court was obligated to do.  The Second \nCircuit\u2019s contrary position cannot be squared with \nRule 60(b)\u2019s text, its broader context, or this Court\u2019s \nprecedents.  It has thus been unanimously rejected by \n\n21 \n \nevery other Court of Appeals.3  That overwhelming \nmajority view is correct, and the Second Circuit\u2019s \noutlier balancing test is wrong. \nA. Rule 60(b)(6) Requires a Movant to Show \n\u201cExtraordinary Circumstances.\u201d \nThis Court has long extolled the importance of \nfinality to our system of justice.  Indeed, \u201cthe very \nobject for which civil courts have been established\u201d is \n\u201cto secure the peace and repose of society by the \nsettlement \nof \nmatters \ncapable \nof \njudicial \ndetermination.\u201d  Southern Pac. R.R. Co. v. United \nStates, 168 U.S. 1, 49 (1897).  \u201c[T]he aid of judicial \ntribunals would not be invoked\u201d if \u201cconclusiveness did \nnot attend the judgments of such tribunals.\u201d  Id.  For \nthat reason, courts since the Founding have \nrecognized that only \u201ca very strong case\u201d may justify \ndisturbing \u201cthe public interest and policy to make an \nend to litigation.\u201d  Ocean Ins.

Farrand ed., 1807). \nThat understanding persisted up through the \nadoption of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in \n1938.  By that time, a patchwork of methods had \ndeveloped for litigants seeking relief after a court\u2019s \nentry of final judgment and the expiration of the term.  \nSee Comment, Temporal Aspects of the Finality of \nJudgments\u2014The Significance of Federal Rule 60(b), \n17 U. Chi. L. Rev. 664, 664-65 (1950).  But courts \nalways remained \u201ccautious in exercising their power\u201d \nto reopen settled matters.  Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. \nHartford-Empire Co., 322 U.S. 238, 244 (1944).  Relief \ncontinued to be reserved only for \u201ccertain limited \nsituations.\u201d  James Wm. Moore & Elizabeth B. A. \nRogers, Federal Relief from Civil Judgments, 55 Yale \nL.J. 623, 627 (1946). \nRule 60(b) codifies many of these \u201cwell-recognized \nand concrete exceptions to the finality principle.\u201d  \nMary Kay Kane, Relief from Federal Judgments: A \nMorass Unrelieved by a Rule, 30 Hastings L.J. 41, 43 \n(1978); see Banister, 590 U.S. at 518.  These specific \nexceptions \ninclude \n(1) \u201cmistake, \ninadvertence, \nsurprise, or excusable neglect,\u201d (2) \u201cnewly discovered \nevidence,\u201d (3) \u201cfraud,\u201d (4) a \u201cvoid\u201d judgment, or \n(5) situations where \u201cthe judgment has been satisfied, \nreleased, or discharged; it is based on an earlier \njudgment that has been reversed or vacated; or \napplying it prospectively is no longer equitable.\u201d  Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 60(b)(1)-(5).  Rule 60(b) also includes a \n\n23 \n \ncatchall provision for \u201cany other reason that justifies \nrelief.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6). \nThat final subsection\u2019s berth has been tightly \ncircumscribed.  \u201cWhen faced with a catchall phrase \nlike [Rule 60(b)(6)], courts do not necessarily afford it \nthe broadest possible construction it can bear.\u201d  \nHarrington v. Purdue Pharma L.P., 144 S. Ct. 2071, \n2082 (2024).  That is because readers \u201cgenerally \nappreciate that the catchall must be interpreted in \nlight of its surrounding context and read to \u2018embrace \nonly objects similar in nature\u2019 to the specific examples \npreceding it.\u201d  Id. (quoting Epic Sys. Corp. v. Lewis, \n584 U.S. 497, 512 (2018)); accord Hall St. Assocs., \nL.L.C. v. Mattel, Inc., 552 U.S. 576, 586 (2008). \nConsistent with that \u201cancient interpretive principle\u201d \nof ejusdem generis, Harrington, 144 S. Ct. at 2082, this \nCourt has long construed Rule 60(b)(6) to authorize \nrelief from a final judgment only in similarly \n\u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d that are not otherwise \nspecifically covered by the Rule, Ackermann, 340 U.S. \nat 199.  The Court has emphasized that stringent \nrequirement time and again in an unbroken line of \ndecisions.  See Kemp v. United States, 596 U.S. 528, \n533 (2022); Tharpe v. Sellers, 583 U.S. 33, 35 (2018) \n(per curiam); Buck v. Davis, 580 U.S. 100, 123 (2017); \nChristeson v. Roper, 574 U.S. 373, 380 (2015) (per \ncuriam); Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 535; Agostini v. Felton, \n521 U.S. 203, 239 (1997); Pioneer Inv. Servs., 507 U.S. \nat 393; Liljeberg v. Health Servs. Acquisition Corp., \n486 U.S. 847, 863 n.11, 864 (1988); Ackermann, 340 \nU.S. at 199; Klapprott v. United States, 335 U.S. 601, \n613-14 (1949).   \n\n24 \n \n\u201cThis very strict interpretation of Rule 60(b) is \nessential if the finality of judgments is to be \npreserved.\u201d  Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 535 (quoting \nLiljeberg, \n486 \nU.S. \nat \n873 \n(Rehnquist, \nC.J., \ndissenting)).  And this Court has left no room for Rule \n15\u2019s liberal amendment policy to creep into the \nequation.  For good reason:  Rule 60(b) is carefully \ncrafted to provide a mechanism only for those rare \n\u201csituations in which relief must be obtained after \njudgment,\u201d and \u201cthe broad amendment policy of Rule \n15(a) should not be construed in a manner that would \nrender [that] provision[] meaningless.\u201d  6 Wright & \nMiller, Federal Practice & Procedure \u00a7 1489 (3d ed. \n2024).  \u201cTo hold otherwise would enable the liberal \namendment policy of Rule 15(a) to be employed in a \nway that is contrary to the philosophy favoring finality \nof judgments and the expeditious termination of \nlitigation\u201d that the Rules were designed to promote.  \nTool Box, Inc. v. Ogden City Corp., 419 F.3d 1084, 1087 \n(10th Cir. 2005) (quoting 6 Wright & Miller, Federal \nPractice & Procedure \u00a7 1489 (2d ed. 1990)); see Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 1. \nThis understanding is also consistent with Rule \n15(a)\u2019s text, history, and structure.  By its terms, Rule \n15(a) provides a liberal repleading policy only \u201cbefore \ntrial.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a) (capitalization altered).  Up \nuntil that point in the litigation, courts \u201cshould freely \ngive leave\u201d to amend a complaint \u201cwhen justice so \nrequires.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2).  This policy \nfacilitates having claims \u201cdecided on [their] merits \nrather than on procedural technicalities.\u201d  6 Wright & \nMiller, supra, \u00a7 1471 (3d ed.).   \n\n25 \n \nBut that liberal pre-trial policy evaporates post-\njudgment.  After all, \u201ca trial court\u2019s final judgment \n\u2018resolves conclusively the substance of all claims, \nrights, and liabilities of all parties to an action\u2019 and \n\u2018ends the litigation on the merits\u2019 in the district court.\u201d  \nBoyd v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corrs., 114 F.4th 1232, 1237 \n(11th Cir. 2024) (citation omitted).  \u201cSo once the court \nhas entered final judgment, Rule 15(a) no longer \napplies and no amendment is possible unless the \njudgment is first set aside.\u201d  Id.  And, where the \nplaintiff seeks vacatur through Rule 60(b)(6), \n\u201cextraordinary circumstances must justify reopening.\u201d  \nKemp, 596 U.S. at 533 (quotation marks omitted).  \nOnly after making that threshold showing to vacate \nthe judgment may the plaintiff seek leave to amend \nunder Rule 15(a)\u2019s standard.  \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s contrary rule breaks from this \nCourt\u2019s precedents, the history and structure of the \nFederal Rules, and every one of its sister Circuits.  It \nabandons the \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d standard \nin favor of a nebulous \u201cbalanc[ing]\u201d inquiry that pits \nRule 60(b)(6)\u2019s protection of \u201cfinality\u201d against \u201cRule \n15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policies.\u201d  Pet.App.8.  And \nit loads the dice in that balancing test against finality, \nproviding that district courts necessarily abuse their \ndiscretion by \u201cdenying post-judgment relief\u201d based on \nthe movant\u2019s \u201cfailure to demonstrate adequate \ngrounds for relief under Rule 60.\u201d  Mandala, 88 F.4th \nat 362 & n.5. \nNot only does that defy this Court\u2019s precedent, but \nit also violates the cardinal principle that \u201c[c]ourts are \nrequired to give effect to Congress\u2019 express inclusions \nand exclusions, not disregard them.\u201d  Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of \n\n26 \n \nMfrs. v. Dep\u2019t of Def., 583 U.S. 109, 126 (2018).  In Rule \n15(a)(2), Congress adopted this Court\u2019s instruction to \n\u201cfreely give leave\u201d to amend before trial.  Fed. R. Civ. \nP. \n15(a)(2). \n \nBut \nCongress \nand \nthis \nCourt \nconspicuously chose not to do the same in Rule 60(b) \nwhen delineating the \u201cgrounds for relief from a final \njudgment.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) (capitalization \naltered).  The implication from that differing language \nis thus straightforward.  When a plaintiff seeks to \n\u201creopen a final judgment,\u201d as here, \u201cthe policy favoring \nthe finality of judgments [is] implicated,\u201d and \u201c[t]he \npermissive policy favoring amendment under Rule 15 \n[is] simply not relevant.\u201d  Garrett v. Wexford Health, \n938 F.3d 69, 86 (3d Cir. 2019) (emphasis added).  \nIndeed, \u201cthere is no pending complaint to amend\u201d once \n\u201cthe action has been dismissed\u201d with prejudice.  \nCalvary Christian Ctr. v. City of Fredericksburg, 710 \nF.3d 536, 540 (4th Cir. 2013); see also, e.g., Pe\u00f1a v. \nMattox, 84 F.3d 894, 903 (7th Cir. 1996); Fisher v. \nKadant, Inc., 589 F.3d 505, 509 (1st Cir. 2009).  The \nmatter is closed, the claim is \u201cextinguishe[d],\u201d and res \njudicata generally \u201cbar[s] a subsequent action on that \nclaim.\u201d  Cooper v. Fed. Rsrv. Bank of Richmond, 467 \nU.S. 867, 874 (1984). \nAs a result, the \u201cmore restrictive standard\u201d for \ngranting a Rule 60(b) motion \u201cmust be satisfied before \nconsideration can be given to a motion to amend.\u201d  \nDaulatzai, 97 F.4th at 179 (emphasis added).  \nOtherwise, as now-Chief Judge Sutton has explained, \nplaintiffs could \u201csidestep the narrow grounds for \nobtaining post-judgment relief\u201d under Rule 60(b), \n\u201cmake the finality of judgments an interim concept,\u201d \nand risk turning Rule 60(b) into a \u201cnullit[y].\u201d  Leisure \nCaviar, LLC v. U.S. Fish & Wildlife Serv., 616 F.3d \n\n27 \n \n612, 616 (6th Cir. 2010).  There is no good reason for \n\u201cjudgment finality\u201d to be so \u201clightly cast aside.\u201d  United \nStates v. Denedo, 556 U.S. 904, 916 (2009).   \nB. Rule 60(b)(6) Provides No Basis for Relief \nfrom a Party\u2019s Free, Calculated Choices. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s rebuke of the \u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d test suffers from another shortcoming.  \nIt \ndefies \nthe \nrequirement \nthat \nthe \nalleged \n\u201c\u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019\u201d be such \u201cthat the \n[moving] party is faultless in the delay.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. \nServs., 507 U.S. at 393 (citation omitted); see \nAckermann, 340 U.S. at 198.  Put another way:  The \nmovant must be \u201ccompletely without fault for his or \nher predicament\u201d and \u201cunable to have taken any steps \nthat would have resulted in preventing the judgment \nfrom which relief is sought.\u201d  12 James Wm. Moore et \nal., Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00a7 60.48[3][b] (3d ed. \n2024).  A party that is even \u201cpartly to blame for the \ndelay\u201d cannot obtain relief under Rule 60(b)(6).  \nPioneer Inv. Servs., 507 U.S. at 393. \nThat requirement fits neatly within the broader \ncontext of Rule 60(b).  After all, Rule 60(b)(6) \u201cis \navailable only when Rules 60(b)(1) through (b)(5) are \ninapplicable.\u201d  Kemp, 596 U.S. at 533.  That narrow, \nresidual role for the catchall clause respects the plain \nmeaning of its \u201c\u2018other reason\u2019 language\u201d and \n\u201cprevent[s] clause (6) from being used to circumvent \nthe 1-year limitations period\u201d that applies to clauses \n(1) through (3).  Liljeberg, 486 U.S. at 863 n.11; see \nFed. R. Civ. P. 60(c)(1).  One of those time-limited \ncircumstances is for \u201cexcusable neglect.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 60(b)(1).  Thus, \u201ca party who failed to take timely \naction due to \u2018excusable neglect\u2019 may not seek relief \n\n28 \n \nmore than a year after the judgment by resorting to \nsubsection (6).\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs., 507 U.S. at 393.  \nIf it could, then the \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d provision and \nits limitations would become \u201csuperfluous\u201d and \n\u201cinsignificant.\u201d  TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U.S. 19, 31 \n(2001) (citation omitted).  Such an interpretation \u201cis of \ncourse to be avoided.\u201d  Dastar Corp. v. Twentieth \nCentury Fox Film Corp., 539 U.S. 23, 35 (2003). \nSo too is any interpretation that would excuse a \nparty\u2019s voluntary waiver of a court\u2019s invitation to \namend.  The \u201cusual federal rule of waiver\u201d applies \nregardless of \u201cprejudice\u201d to the party that \u201cknowingly \nrelinquish[ed]\u201d his rights.  Morgan v. Sundance, Inc., \n596 U.S. 411, 417-19 (2022).  And this Court has made \nclear that \u201c[i]t would be \u2018an abuse of discretion\u2019\u201d to \n\u201c\u2018override a [party\u2019s] deliberative waiver.\u2019\u201d  Wood v. \nMilyard, 566 U.S. 463, 472-73 (2012) (quoting Day v. \nMcDonough, 547 U.S. 198, 202 (2006)). \nRule 60(b)(6) is no exception.  As this Court held \nlong ago, parties \u201ccannot be relieved of [their] \nchoice[s]\u201d through that mechanism simply \u201cbecause \nhindsight seems to indicate\u201d the improvidence of their \ndecisions.  Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 198.  A party\u2019s \nwaiver of the right to amend in the normal course\u2014\nlike Respondents\u2019 repeated waivers here\u2014thus cannot \njustify relief from the entry of a final judgment that \nresults from that party\u2019s \u201cconsidered choice.\u201d  Id. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s tortured approach violates \nthese basic principles of waiver.  By requiring district \ncourts to consider Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberality policy in \ntandem with Rule 60\u2019s regard for finality\u2014even when \nthe movant has consistently and consciously rejected \nnumerous invitations and opportunities to amend\u2014\n\n29 \n \nthe Second Circuit has directed district courts to \noverride and rescue parties from their \u201cfree, \ncalculated, [and] deliberate choices.\u201d  Id.  That is \nprecisely the sort of unfair and inefficient relitigation \nloop that this Court has repeatedly warned against.  \n\u201cThere must be an end to litigation someday,\u201d and a \nlitigant\u2019s strategic choices \u201care not to be relieved \nfrom.\u201d  Id. \nC. The Second Circuit\u2019s Outlier Balancing \nTest Is Untenable. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s approach cannot be squared \nwith any of this.  The decision below held that \nRespondents \nneed \nnot \nshow \n\u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d to reopen the final judgment entered \nagainst \nthem \nbecause, \nin \nits \nview, \n\u201cspecial \nconsiderations come into play\u201d when \u201cvacatur is \nsought in order to obtain leave to file an amended \ncomplaint.\u201d  Pet.App.7 (quoting Mandala, 88 F.4th at \n361).  But the court failed to root these supposedly \nspecial considerations in text, context, or precedent.  \nAnd it contradicted each of those sources of legal \nauthority along the way. \n1. The Second Circuit\u2019s Test Is Atextual. \nMost notably, the Second Circuit\u2019s balancing test is \nunmoored from the text of the Federal Rules.  This \nCourt interprets the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \nas it would any statute.  See Bus. Guides, Inc. v. \nChromatic Commc\u2019ns Enters., Inc., 498 U.S. 533, 540-\n41 (1991).  Its analysis in that interpretive enterprise \nalways \u201cbegins with the text.\u201d  Ross v. Blake, 578 U.S. \n632, 638 (2016).  Here, however, the Second Circuit \n\n30 \n \n\u201cmade no attempt to ground its analysis\u201d in the actual \nlanguage of Rule 60(b)(6).  Id. \nNor could it.  Nothing in that Rule\u2019s text compels \ndistricts courts to give \u201c\u2018due regard\u2019 to \u2018the liberal \nspirit of Rule 15\u2019\u201d after final judgment \u201cby ensuring \nplaintiffs at least one opportunity to replead.\u201d  \nMandala, 88 F.4th at 362 (quoting Metzler Inv. GmbH \nv. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., 970 F.3d 133, 146 (2d \nCir. 2020)).  Nothing in the Federal Rules\u2019 text allows \nplaintiffs to leapfrog over \u201cRule 60(b)\u2019s finality \ngauntlet\u201d to the sanctuary of \u201cRule 15(a)\u2019s liberal \nrepleading policy.\u201d  Pet.App.8.  And nothing in the text \ncalls for any exceptions to Rule 60(b)\u2019s demanding \nstandards for \u201cRelief from a Final Judgment.\u201d  Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 60(b). \nMeanwhile, the text of Rule 15(a) expressly \nindicates that it has no role to play after judgment.  \nInstead, it applies only to \u201cAmendments Before Trial.\u201d  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 15(a); see Krupski v. Costa Crociere S. p. \nA., 560 U.S. 538, 553 (2010).  It is in that setting\u2014\nbefore trial and a final judgment\u2014that the Rules \nencourage courts to \u201cfreely give leave\u201d to amend, so \nthat the relevant factual allegations and legal issues \ncan be joined and presented at trial.  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n15(a)(2).  By contrast, Rule 15(a) does not provide any \nmechanism for amending pleadings after dismissal, \nfinal judgment, and affirmance on appeal.  At that \npoint, there are no pending pleadings to amend.  And \nalterations of the final judgment are the province of \nRule 60(b). \nThe Second Circuit thus failed to heed the plain \ntext of both Rule 15(a) and Rule 60(b) when fashioning \nits balancing test.  That led it to fault the District \n\n31 \n \nCourt for evaluating Plaintiffs\u2019 Rule 60(b) motion \n\u201cunder only Rule 60(b)\u2019s standard.\u201d  Pet.App.7.  But \nthat is exactly what the District Court was supposed \nto do.  \u201cPlaintiffs must first meet the threshold \nrequirement of 60(b)(6)\u2019s extraordinary or exceptional \ncircumstances to vacate the judgment before seeking\u201d \nto amend their pleadings.  In re Ferro Corp. Deriv. \nLitig., 511 F.3d 611, 624 (6th Cir. 2008).  The structure \nand plain text of the Federal Rules both make clear \nthat failure to meet that burden forecloses relief. \n2. The Second Circuit\u2019s Test Conflicts \nwith Other Provisions of Rule 60. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s test makes even less sense \nwhen assessed within the \u201ctotal context\u201d of Rule 60.  \nPavelic & LeFlore v. Marvel Ent. Grp., 493 U.S. 120, \n123 (1989).  A Rule 60(b) motion to reopen \u201cmust be \nmade within a reasonable time\u2014and for reasons (1), \n(2), and (3) no more than a year after the entry of the \njudgment.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(c)(1).  Yet the Second \nCircuit\u2019s balancing test for Rule 60(b)(6) enables \nlitigants to evade those explicit time limitations in at \nleast three ways. \nFirst, the Second Circuit\u2019s liberal repleading policy \npermits litigants to bypass Rule 60\u2019s strict time \nlimitations for \u201cexcusable neglect.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n60(b)(1).  If a plaintiff neglects to include certain \nallegations in his complaint and that omission is \n\u201cexcusable,\u201d then he has only one year to move to \nreopen the judgment based on that oversight through \nRule 60(b)(1).  He cannot do the same through Rule \n60(b)(6), as a party cannot \u201c\u2018avail himself\u2019\u201d of that \nprovision \u201cif his motion is based on grounds specified \nin clause (1).\u201d  Liljeberg, 486 U.S. at 863 n.11 (citation \n\n32 \n \nomitted).  But the Second Circuit allows and even \nencourages plaintiffs to do precisely that, by \ncompelling district courts to reopen actions under Rule \n60(b)(6) if the plaintiffs \u201creasonably\u201d (i.e., excusably) \nneglected to include their late-breaking allegations \nbefore final judgment.  Mandala, 88 F.4th at 359, 364.4  \nRather than embrace that misguided approach, this \nCourt \nshould \n\u201cresist\u201d \nany \ninterpretation \nthat \n\u201crender[s] [Rule 60(b)] so internally inconsistent.\u201d  \nJones v. Hendrix, 599 U.S. 465, 479 (2023) (citation \nomitted). \nSecond, the Second Circuit\u2019s balancing test serves \nas an end-run around Rule 60(b)(1)\u2019s time limits for \n\u201cmistake.\u201d  In Mandala, for instance, the Court of \nAppeals held that Rule 60(b)(1) is \u201cinapplicable\u201d\u2014and \nthat \u201c\u2018the liberal spirit of Rule 15\u2019\u201d instead kicks in\u2014\nwhen a \u201cvacatur motion arises from a legal mistake\u201d \nthat leads a plaintiff into \u201cinsufficient pleading.\u201d  88 \nF.4th at 360-62 (emphasis added; citation omitted).  \nYet, there is no reason why that form of \u201clegal mistake\u201d \nwould pull a motion outside of Rule 60(b)(1)\u2019s ambit.  \nThose who drafted and adopted the Rules \u201cchose to \ninclude \u2018mistake\u2019 unqualified.\u201d  Kemp, 596 U.S. at 534.  \n\u201cWhen the Rule was adopted in 1938 and revised in \n \n4  Of course, if a plaintiff \u201cinexcusably\u201d omitted their new \nallegations, that cannot possibly provide a \u201creason that justifies \nrelief.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6) (emphasis added); see, e.g., \nInexcusable, American College Dictionary 621 (Clarence L. \nBarnhart ed., 1953) (\u201cincapable of being justified\u201d); Inexcusable, \nWebster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary 428 (6th ed. 1949) (\u201cnot \nadmitting excuse or justification\u201d).  It is therefore \u201cclear\u201d that \n\u201cinexcusable neglect\u201d similarly \u201cdoes not justify relief under Rule \n60(b)(6).\u201d  Helm v. Resolution Tr. Corp., 84 F.3d 874, 879 (7th Cir. \n1996); see Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 202; PIRS Cap., LLC v. \nWilliams, 54 F.4th 1050, 1055 (8th Cir. 2022). \n\n33 \n \n1946, \nthe \nword \n\u2018mistake\u2019 \napplied \nto \nany \n\u2018misconception,\u2019 \u2018misunderstanding,\u2019 or \u2018fault in \nopinion or judgment.\u2019\u201d  Id. (quoting Webster\u2019s New \nInternational Dictionary 1383 (1914)).  That includes \n\u201cmistakes of law\u201d made by judges and litigants alike.  \nId. at 534-35.  The Second Circuit\u2019s atextual standard \nthus clashes with Rule 60\u2019s limited availability of \nrelief for \u201cmistake\u201d as well.  That provides yet another \ncontextual strike against it. \nThird, the Second Circuit\u2019s approach overrides \nRule 60(b)(2)\u2019s restrictions for vacatur based on new \nevidence.  That provision allows parties \u201cto reopen \nproceedings\u201d based only \u201con matter which could not \nreasonably have been previously adduced\u201d\u2014and even \nthen, only if the party presents that material within a \nyear of final judgment.  INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314, \n326 (1992); see Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(2) (\u201cnewly \ndiscovered evidence that, with reasonable diligence, \ncould not have been discovered in time to move for a \nnew trial\u201d).  This rule is consistent with centuries of \nhistorical \npractice. \n \nSee, \ne.g., \nJoseph \nStory, \nCommentaries on Equity Pleadings 322 (2d ed. 1840) \n(explaining that a final judgment can be reopened \nbased only on \u201csome new matter, which hath arisen in \ntime after the decree, and not on any new proof, which \nmight have been used, when the decree was made\u201d \n(discussing the Ordinances in Chancery of Lord \nChancellor Bacon)); Purcell v. Miner, 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) \n519, 521 (1867) (same).  But, under the Second \nCircuit\u2019s regime, movants can introduce new factual \nallegations through Rule 60(b)(6), even if they could \nhave presented them before, and even if more than a \nyear has elapsed from the entry of final judgment.  See \nMandala, 88 F.4th at 365.  In this way, too, the Second \n\n34 \n \nCircuit has put Rule 60 \u201cat war with itself.\u201d  United \nStates ex rel. Polansky v. Exec. Health Res., Inc., 599 \nU.S. 419, 434 (2023) (citation omitted).  \n3. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s Test Distorts this \nCourt\u2019s Precedents. \nLeft with no support in Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s text or \ncontext, the Second Circuit tried to ground its \nstandard in Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178.  See \nMandala, 88 F.4th at 362; Pet.App.6.  But Foman did \nnot address a Rule 60(b)(6) motion.  This Court instead \nrecognized the motion there (which was filed just a day \nafter the district court\u2019s decision) \u201cas one under Rule \n59(e).\u201d  Foman, 371 U.S. at 179, 181 (emphasis added). \nAs a result, Foman is simply inapt in this setting. \nRather, the controlling precedent is Gonzalez, which \nreaffirmed that a Rule 60(b)(6) motion \u201crequires a \nshowing of \u2018extraordinary circumstances.\u2019\u201d  545 U.S. at \n536.  And there is no basis to conflate that demanding \nstandard with the one for Rule 59(e).  \u201cThe difference \nbetween the two rules . . . is material, both in scope \nand purpose, and, by their own terms, different \nstandards apply.\u201d  Daulatzai, 97 F.4th at 177. \nIndeed, \u201cRule 60(b) differs from Rule 59(e) in just \nabout every way that matters to the inquiry here.\u201d  \nBanister, 590 U.S. at 518; see Daulatzai, 97 F.4th at \n177-78.  A Rule 59(e) motion \u201cis a one-time effort to \nbring alleged errors in a just-issued decision to a \n[district] court\u2019s attention, before taking a single \nappeal.\u201d  Banister, 590 U.S. at 521; see Fed. R. Civ. P. \n59(e).  Accordingly, the time for bringing a Rule 59(e) \nmotion \u201cis short\u201428 days from entry of the judgment, \nwith no possibility of an extension.\u201d  Banister, 590 U.S. \nat 507-08.  And, because \u201c[i]t is a limited continuation \n\n35 \n \nof the original proceeding,\u201d a timely Rule 59(e) motion \nautomatically \n\u201c\u2018suspend[s] \nthe \nfinality\u2019 \nof \nany \njudgment.\u201d  Id. at 514, 521 (citation omitted); see Fed. \nR. App. P. 4(a)(4)(A)(iv).  \u201cOnly the disposition of that \nmotion restores the finality of the original judgment,\u201d \nand \nthat \ndisposition \n\u201cmerges \nwith \nthe \nprior \ndetermination, so that the reviewing court takes up \nonly one judgment\u201d on appeal.  Banister, 590 U.S. at \n508-09 (brackets and quotation marks omitted).  By \ncontrast, \u201c[a] Rule 60(b) motion\u2014often distant in time \nand scope and always giving rise to a separate \nappeal\u2014attacks an already completed judgment,\u201d and \nit \u201c\u2018does not affect the [original] judgment\u2019s finality or \nsuspend its operation.\u201d  Id. at 520-21 (second \nalteration in original) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(c)(2)).  \nA Rule 60(b) motion therefore uniquely \u201cthreaten[s] an \nalready final judgment with successive litigation.\u201d  Id. \nat 519.  Consequently, the \u201cstandard for granting a \nRule 59(e) motion\u201d is more \u201cbroad and open ended\u201d \nthan Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s strict standard for relief.  \nDaulatzai, 97 F.4th at 177.   \nThe Second Circuit failed to grasp these crucial \ndifferences.  Instead, Mandala and the decision below \nwrongly treated Rule 59(e) and Rule 60(b)(6) motions \nas fungible, and then uncritically transplanted \nFoman\u2019s more forgiving Rule 59(e) standard to \noverride the stringent requirements for Rule 60(b)(6).  \nThis Court should reject that misguided approach.  It \ndisregards Rule 60(b)\u2019s unique text and context and \nflouts this Court\u2019s Rule 60(b) precedents. \n\n36 \n \n4. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s Test Undermines \nthe Guiding Principles of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure. \nEven if there were any doubt (which there is not), \nthe Federal Rules would require this Court to resolve \nit against the Second Circuit\u2019s interpretation.  That is \nbecause the Rules state that they must be \u201cconstrued\u201d \nin the face of ambiguity to \u201csecure the just, speedy, and \ninexpensive determination of every action and \nproceeding.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 1.   \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s approach flips those guiding \nprinciples on their head.  It eschews finality, and it \nundermines confidence in the outcome of hard-fought \nlitigation.  It also enables plaintiffs to \u201cuse the court \nas a sounding board to discover holes in their \narguments, then \u2018reopen the case by amending their \ncomplaint to take account of the court\u2019s decision,\u2019\u201d even \nafter testing the complaint against a full appeal and \nrepeatedly declining earlier opportunities to amend.  \nLeisure Caviar, 616 F.3d at 616 (quoting James v. \nWatt, 716 F.2d 71, 78 (1st Cir. 1983) (Breyer, J.)).  Such \ngamesmanship will inevitably draw out litigation and \ndrive up its already high costs.   \nThis case proves the point.  The matter \u201chas been \nclosed since January 15, 2020,\u201d when Petitioner \nsecured a final judgment in its favor.  Pet.App.10.  \nPetitioner prevailed on appeal after that.  Then \nPetitioner successfully showed that Rule 60(b) \nprovided no path for reopening the final judgment.  \nRespondents\u2019 \u201cfail[ure] to satisfy the requirements of \nRule 60(b) should therefore have ended the matter.\u201d  \nDaulatzai, 97 F.4th at 179.  Yet, Respondents continue \nto seek a return to square one\u2014merely so that they \n\n37 \n \ncan plead new factual allegations that were previously \navailable to them and which they had expressly \ndeclined to plead before dismissal. \nAllowing losing litigants to thus restart the loop of \nlitigation would not promote the \u201cspeedy\u201d and \n\u201cinexpensive\u201d resolution of claims.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 1.  \nNor would it be \u201cjust.\u201d  Id.  Quite the opposite:  Like \nthe doctrine of res judicata, Rule 60(b)\u2019s demanding \nrequirements for reopening a final judgment are \nthemselves rooted in \u201cfundamental and substantial \njustice,\u201d and they are designed to further both \u201c\u2018public \npolicy and . . . private peace.\u2019\u201d  Federated Dep\u2019t Stores, \nInc. v. Moitie, 452 U.S. 394, 401 (1981) (citation \nomitted); see supra Section I.A.  They should therefore \n\u201cbe cordially regarded and enforced by the courts.\u201d  \nMoitie, 452 U.S. at 401 (citation omitted).  The \n\u201cweighty interests in finality\u201d must \u201ctrump the \ninterest in giving losing litigants access to an \nadditional\u201d round of proceedings in all but the most \nunusual case.  See San Remo Hotel, L.P. v. City & \nCounty of S.F., 545 U.S. 323, 345 (2005).  That is \nparticularly true when the movant seeks a mulligan to \nrescue himself from his \u201cfree, calculated, deliberate \nchoices.\u201d  Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 198.   \nConsistent with these fundamental tenets of civil \nprocedure, courts have long rejected belated attempts \nby plaintiffs to attack a final judgment with an \namended complaint.  See supra note 3 (collecting \ncases).  They have instead required plaintiffs to put \ntheir best foot forward before judgment or risk an end \nto their lawsuit.  And they have reserved Rule 60(b)(6) \nrelief\u2014as this Court\u2019s precedents command\u2014for only \n\n38 \n \ntruly \u201ccompelling circumstances\u201d outside the movant\u2019s \ncontrol.  James, 716 F.2d at 78 (Breyer, J.). \n*   *   * \nIn sum, Rule 15(a) \u201cgoverns amendment of \npleadings before judgment is entered; it has no \napplication after judgment is entered.\u201d  Jacobs v. \nTempur-Pedic Int\u2019l Inc., 626 F.3d 1327, 1344 (11th Cir. \n2010).  From that point, a party that seeks \u201crelief from \na final judgment\u201d must first satisfy the rigorous \ndemands of Rule 60(b).  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) \n(capitalization altered).5  And where, as here, the \nparty seeks such relief under Rule 60(b)(6), he must \n\u201cshow \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019\u201d beyond his \ncontrol that would \u201cjustify[] the reopening of a final \njudgment.\u201d  Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 535 (quoting \nAckermann, 340 U.S. at 199); see Pioneer Inv. Servs., \n507 U.S. at 393.  Only after surmounting that \nintentionally high hurdle for vacating the judgment \ncan he invoke the more liberal policies of Rule 15(a).  \nThe Second Circuit erred in holding to the contrary. \nII. Respondents Cannot Satisfy Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s \nStringent Standard. \nThis Court should reverse the decision below and \nbring an end to this litigation once and for all.  Unlike \nthe Second Circuit, the District Court applied the \ncorrect legal standard by refusing to \u201c\u2018entertain a \nmotion to amend the complaint\u2019 under Rule 15(a) \nwithout \u2018a valid basis to vacate the previously entered \njudgment\u2019 under Rule 60(b).\u201d  Pet.App.7 (quoting \nDistrict Court\u2019s decision).  It properly treated those \n \n5  Or those of Rule 59(e), if the motion is filed within 28 days \nof the entry of judgment. \n\n39 \n \nRules as posing two distinct inquiries.  And, in a \nthoughtful \nopinion \nissued \nafter \na \npre-motion \nconference and full briefing, it methodically explained \nwhy Respondents \u201chave not demonstrated any \nextraordinary circumstances warranting relief under \nRule 60(b)(6).\u201d  Pet.App.14. \nA. Respondents Have Not Demonstrated \n\u201cExtraordinary Circumstances.\u201d \nWhen a District Court applies the correct legal \nstandard, as here, \u201cRule 60(b) proceedings are subject \nto only limited and deferential appellate review.\u201d  \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. at 535.  An appellate court \u201cmay \nreview the [district court\u2019s] ruling only for abuse of \ndiscretion.\u201d  Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corrs. of Ill., 434 \nU.S. 257, 263 n.7 (1978).  And that standard affords \u201ca \nwide range of choice\u201d to the district court.  McLane Co. \nv. EEOC, 581 U.S. 72, 83 (2017) (citation omitted).  \nAppellate courts cannot \u201cinterfere with the District \nCourt\u2019s exercise of discretion unless\u201d they are left with \n\u201ca definite and firm conviction that the court \ncommitted a clear error of judgment.\u201d  Betterbox \nCommc\u2019ns, Ltd. v. BB Techs, Inc., 300 F.3d 325, 332 \n(3d Cir. 2002) (Alito, J.) (alterations adopted; citation \nomitted).  In other words, the Court must \u201cfind a \ncomplete absence of a reasonable basis and [be] \ncertain that the [District Court\u2019s] decision is wrong.\u201d  \nDavis v. Kan. Dep\u2019t of Corrs., 507 F.3d 1246, 1248 (10th \nCir. 2007) (citation omitted). \nThat is not the case here.  Far from it.  Respondents \nhave never contended \u201cthat any of their proposed new \nallegations were unavailable to them\u201d when they filed \ntheir complaint or when they repeatedly declined the \nDistrict Court\u2019s invitations to amend.  Pet.App.15.  \n\n40 \n \nThey argue only that the Second Circuit \u201cclarified\u201d the \nJASTA pleading standard in some respects in their \nprevious appeal of the District Court\u2019s dismissal.  \nBIO.2.  But that is neither correct nor relevant.   \nIt is not correct because the Second Circuit \naffirmed the dismissal on grounds that the District \nCourt had relied on\u2014namely, that Respondents\u2019 \n\u201callegations do not support an inference that BLOM \nBank was aware of the Three Customers\u2019 ties with \nHamas prior to the relevant attacks.\u201d  Pet.App.49; see \nalso Pet.App.74-75 (\u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 allegations therefore \nfail to raise above the speculative level the specter that \nBLOM was aware of a connection between the Three \nCustomers and Hamas at the time it provided \nfinancial services to the Three Customers.\u201d).  In dicta, \nthe Second Circuit disagreed with other grounds relied \non by the District Court.  But the District Court\u2019s \nindependent conclusion that Respondents failed to \ndemonstrate general awareness at the time of the \nalleged assistance\u2014as JASTA requires\u2014\u201cremain[s] \ncompletely unaffected by anything that was decided or \nsaid\u201d by the Second Circuit in this case or any other.  \nPolites v. United States, 364 U.S. 426, 436 (1960) \n(affirming denial of Rule 60(b) motion).   \nRespondents\u2019 argument is also irrelevant because, \neven if the Second Circuit had clarified its view of the \nlaw, that would not be enough to satisfy Rule 60(b)(6).  \n\u201cIntervening developments in the law by themselves \nrarely\u201d \nif \never \n\u201cconstitute \nthe \nextraordinary \ncircumstances required for relief under Rule 60(b)(6).\u201d  \nAgostini, 521 U.S. at 239; see Pet.App.14-15.  And the \ndevelopments here are by no means groundbreaking.  \nThe governing statute did not change after final \n\n41 \n \njudgment. \n \nRespondents \nmerely \nallege \na \n\u201cclarification[]\u201d of the law by the Second Circuit that \nwas in line with their own interpretation.  BIO.25.  \nThere \nis \nnothing \n\u201cextraordinary\u201d \nabout \nthat.  \nRespondents never \u201cexplain[ed] why they did not \nallege facts sufficient to satisfy the standard for which \nthey were advocating.\u201d  Pet.App.17 n.5.  And clarifying \nthe law is what appellate courts do all the time.  In \nfact, this Court has held that even a \u201cchange in the \nlaw\u201d worked by one of its decisions abrogating \npreviously controlling circuit precedent could not \njustify Rule 60(b)(6) relief.  Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 536-\n37 (emphasis added).  Such a change in decisional \ncaselaw, \nthe \nCourt \nexplained, \nis \n\u201chardly \nextraordinary.\u201d  Id. at 536.  The circumstances here \nare even less so.  \nIn short, the District Court\u2019s determination that \nRespondents failed to satisfy Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s high bar \nfor reopening a final judgment fell well within the \nrange of permissible decisions.  It was not an abuse of \ndiscretion.  It should have been upheld for that reason \nalone. \nB. Respondents Waived or Forfeited Multiple \nOpportunities to Amend Their Complaint. \nNot only did the District Court act within its \ndiscretion, but it would have abused its discretion had \nit ruled the other way.  As this Court has explained, it \nis \u201can abuse of discretion\u201d to \u201coverride a [party\u2019s] \ndeliberative waiver.\u201d  Wood, 566 U.S. at 472-73 \n(citation omitted).  And this case involves waiver many \ntimes over.  Respondents \u201cdo not contend that the \nadditional facts they now propose to allege were not \navailable\u201d to them before, and they \u201cconcede that they \n\n42 \n \ntwice declined the opportunity to amend their \nComplaint before th[e] [District] Court dismissed it.\u201d  \nPet.App.16, 18 n.6.  The District Court rightly held \nthat those repeated waivers foreclosed relief as well.  \nSee Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 198.   \nRespondents first rejected the District Court\u2019s \ninvitation to amend at the pre-motion conference.  \nPet.App.16-17.  Before that conference, Petitioner \nexplained that \u201cthe Complaint alleges nothing more \nthan that [Petitioner] provided routine banking \nservices to organizations that later were revealed to be \nconnected to Hamas.\u201d  JA.145.  \u201c[N]one of the \nallegations, if true, would establish that [Petitioner] \nwas aware of that connection at the time it provided \nthose banking services\u201d to the Three Customers.  Id.  \nAccordingly, the District Court asked Respondents\u2019 \ncounsel if there were \u201cany additional facts [they] could \nadd to the allegations\u201d to address Petitioner\u2019s \narguments.  Pet.App.93.  Respondents\u2019 counsel \n\u201cexpressly declined\u201d the invitation.  Pet.App.17.  The \nDistrict Court then asked a second time if \nRespondents \u201cwould not want to amend\u201d if the Court \n\u201cwere to grant [Petitioner\u2019s] motion.\u201d  Pet.App.93.  \nRespondents unequivocally stated that they \u201cwould \nnot seek leave to amend.\u201d  Pet.App.94.  Hence, the \nDistrict Court issued a minute entry and scheduling \norder to that effect.  JA.156. \nNotwithstanding that entry, the District Court \ngave Respondents yet another chance to amend at oral \nargument \non \nPetitioner\u2019s \nmotion \nto \ndismiss.  \nPet.App.17-18.  At the hearing, the judge explained \nthat she \u201cjust [did not] see any knowledge on the part \nof [Petitioner]\u201d alleged in the complaint.  Pet.App.118.  \n\n43 \n \nShe asked if \u201ceverything [she] need[ed] to consider in \nterms of sufficiency of [the] pleading is going to be \nfound in the complaint that\u2019s filed in this case.\u201d  \nPet.App.124.  And she asked Respondents to confirm \nthat \u201c[t]here are no facts that [Respondents] would \nhave to offer to address some of the contentions of \n[Petitioner] \nregarding \nknowledge, \nespecially.\u201d  \nPet.App.125.  In response, Respondents \u201cagain \nexpressly declined the opportunity to amend their \ncomplaint\u201d and chose to proceed on their complaint as \npled.  Pet.App.18.  That was a \u201ccalculated and \ndeliberate\u201d choice.  Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 198.  Rule \n60(b)(6) therefore \u201chas no application.\u201d  Id. at 202. \nNor did Respondents\u2019 waivers stop there.  Despite \nproceeding up to the Second Circuit, Respondents \n\u201cnever appealed the \u2018with prejudice\u2019 aspect of the \ndismissal\u201d and never argued that the District Court \nshould \nhave \ngranted \nthem \nleave \nto \nreplead.  \nPet.App.16 n.4.  They simply maintained that their \nallegations were sufficient.  The District Court \ncorrectly recognized this litigation choice as still \nanother waiver that precluded Respondents from \nseeking leave to replead if they lost on appeal.  See id. \n(citing 18A Wright & Miller, Federal Practice & \nProcedure \u00a7 4433 (3d ed. 2021) (\u201cA party who elects to \nappeal on one issue, omitting another issue on which \nit lost, is subject to issue preclusion on the issue not \nappealed.\u201d)).   \nThat failure was by itself fatal, even ignoring \nRespondents\u2019 previous waivers.  If a party\u2019s \u201creason \nasserted for [its] Rule 60(b)(6) motion could have been \naddressed on appeal from the judgment,\u201d then the \nmotion must be denied \u201cas merely an inappropriate \n\n44 \n \nsubstitute for an appeal.\u201d  Aikens v. Ingram, 652 F.3d \n496, 501 (4th Cir. 2011) (en banc).  This understanding \nthat Rule 60(b)(6) \u201ccannot be used as a substitute for \nappeal\u201d has been \u201csettled\u201d for decades.  Jean F. \nRydstrom, Construction and Application of Rule \n60(b)(6) of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 15 A.L.R. \nFed. 193, \u00a7 2[a] (2024).  And that principle makes \neminent sense.  Otherwise, parties could skirt the \nlimitations period for post-judgment motions based on \n\u201cmistake, \ninadvertence, \nsurprise, \nor \nexcusable \nneglect,\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1), as well as the \njurisdictional time limits for appealing an adverse \ndecision, see Fed. R. App. P. 4(a); Bowles v. Russell, 551 \nU.S. 205, 206 (2007). \nEach of the foregoing waivers demonstrates that \nRespondents were not \u201cfaultless in the delay.\u201d  Pioneer \nInv. Servs., 507 U.S. at 393.  That delay resulted from \ntheir own strategic decisions, each of which precludes \nrelief.  And, beyond those waivers, Respondents \nforfeited still more opportunities to seek amendment \nof their complaint.  In particular, before failing to \nappeal from the District Court\u2019s \u201cwith prejudice\u201d \nruling, they failed to file a Rule 59(e) motion \nchallenging that aspect of the District Court\u2019s \ndismissal.  And despite being invited to file \nsupplemental briefing in the Second Circuit\u2014after \nthat court issued its controlling decision in Kaplan\u2014\nRespondents still failed to request leave to amend in \nlight of that new precedent.   \nRespondents have thus come nowhere close to \nmeeting Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d \nstandard.  Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 536.  In fact, they \ncould not even satisfy Foman\u2019s more lenient standard \n\n45 \n \nfor Rule 59(e) motions.  Foman held only that a district \ncourt \nerrs \nby \n\u201coutright \nrefus[ing]\u201d \nto \npermit \namendment before appeal \u201cwithout any justifying \nreason.\u201d  371 U.S. at 182.  Here, by contrast, the \nDistrict Court provided many justifying reasons for \ndenying relief (after appellate proceedings had \nalready concluded).  It explained that Respondents \n\u201chad ample opportunity to pursue all legal avenues \navailable to them for relief,\u201d but they simply chose not \nto do so.  Pet.App.16.  They instead engaged in a \n\u201cdocumented series of deliberate choices not to cure \nthe deficiencies identified in their pleading by \n[Petitioner] and [the District] Court.\u201d  Pet.App.19.  \nThose \u201cfree, calculated, deliberate choices are not to be \nrelieved from.\u201d  Id. (quoting Ackermann, 340 U.S. at \n198).  Not only was the District Court\u2019s decision a \npermissible exercise of discretion, but it was \ndemonstrably correct. \n \n \n\n46 \n \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should reverse \nthe judgment below. \n  \n \n \n \n  Respectfully submitted, \nJONATHAN R.

Circuit courts generally hold that \nmeans providing an opportunity to amend once a ruling \nidentifies remediable defects, if any, in a pleading. Fail-\ning to provide that opportunity may constitute an \u201cex-\ntraordinary circumstance\u201d and a basis to vacate a judg-\nment under Rule 60(b)(6).  \nHere, the Second Circuit found that the district \ncourt dismissed Respondents\u2019 complaint by applying \nthe \u201cwrong legal standard\u201d for pleading an aiding and \nabetting claim (in the Second Circuit) under the Justice \nAgainst Sponsors of Terrorism Act, as well as a stand-\nard for pleading knowledge that was \u201ctoo exacting\u201d and \nall but impossible to meet by amendment. The circuit \ncourt provided clarified pleading standards and identi-\nfied specific, remediable defects in the complaint. Re-\nspondents then promptly moved to vacate the district \ncourt\u2019s judgment in order to meet those clarified stand-\nards in an amended complaint\u2014their first in this litiga-\ntion. The district court refused and, after Respondents \nappealed again, the circuit issued a non-precedential \nsummary order remanding the case for \u201crecon-\nsider[ation].\u201d \nThe question presented is thus whether the circuit \ncourt erred in directing the district court to reconsider \nits refusal to grant Respondents an opportunity to meet \nthe pleading standards the circuit corrected in the prior \nappeal. \n \n \n\nii \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \nQUESTION PRESENTED ............................................. i \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES ......................................... iv \nINTRODUCTION .......................................................... 1 \nSTATEMENT ................................................................ 4 \nI. \nThe Complaint and Pre-Motion Conference for \nBLOM\u2019s Motion to Dismiss .............................. 4 \nII. \nThe Motion to Dismiss ..................................... 7 \nIII.

The dis-\ntrict court had denied vacatur because Plaintiffs de-\nclined its pre-dismissal invitations to amend their \ncomplaint\u2014but the circuit court found the district \ncourt was applying the \u201cwrong\u201d pleading standards, \nPet.App.5, which were so overly \u201cexacting\u201d that Plain-\ntiffs could not meet them before discovery, Pet.App.49.  \nPetitioner (\u201cBLOM\u201d) argues that by making this \nstraightforward remand, the Second Circuit has effec-\ntively \u201cabandon[ed] the \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 \nstandard in favor of a nebulous \u2018balanc[ing]\u2019 inquiry \nthat pits Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s protection of \u2018finality\u2019 against \n\u2018Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policies.\u2019\u201d Pet.Br.25 \n(quoting Pet.App.8). In BLOM\u2019s telling, the Second \nCircuit has \u201cjettisoned\u201d Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s guardrails, \nPet.Br.14., and motions for post-judgment amend-\nments will now be all but rubber-stamped in the cir-\ncuit. This is incorrect. \nFirst of all, this conclusion is not supported by the \nspare language of the summary order, which simply \ndirects the district court to \u201creconsider\u201d denying vaca-\ntur given Second Circuit and Supreme Court prece-\ndents. Nothing has been \u201cabandoned\u201d\u2014consistent \nwith decisions from this Court, \u201c[r]elief under Rule \n60(b)(6)\u201d in the Second Circuit \u201cis reserved for cases \nthat present \u2018extraordinary circumstances,\u2019\u201d including \nwhere a party seeks post-judgment amendment. Man-\ndala v. NTT Data, Inc., 88 F.4th 353, 361 (2d Cir. 2023) \n(citation omitted). Indeed, the standards the Second \n\n \n \n \n \n \n2 \n \nCircuit has \u201cdeveloped\u201d\u2014and reaffirmed by the sum-\nmary order below\u2014\u201cfor evaluating postjudgment mo-\ntions generally place significant emphasis on the \n\u2018value of finality and repose.\u2019\u201d Williams v. Citigroup \nInc., 659 F.3d 208, 213 (2d Cir. 2011) (citation omit-\nted). \nSecond, balancing finality and justice is not \u201cnebu-\nlous,\u201d as BLOM calls it, but rather inherent to Rule \n60(b)(6) jurisprudence: The rule\u2019s \u201cextraordinary cir-\ncumstances\u201d requirement \u201cexists in order to balance \nthe broad language of Rule 60(b)(6), which allows \ncourts to set aside judgments for \u2018any\u2019 reason justify-\ning relief, with the interest in the finality of judg-\nments.\u201d Budget Blinds, Inc. v. White, 536 F.3d 244, \n255 (3d Cir. 2008). When considering a motion to \namend a complaint, finality interests are \u201cbalance[d] \n. . . with the preference expressed in the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure in general, and Rule 15 in particu-\nlar, for resolving disputes on their merits.\u201d Krupski v. \nCosta Crociere S. p. A., 560 U.S. 538, 550 (2010).  \nThird, this case does involve truly \u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d because (1) the district court dismissed \nthe complaint using a set of \u201cwrong legal standards,\u201d \nincluding the nearly impossible requirement of alleg-\ning, without the opportunity for any discovery, \u201cacts or \nstatements\u201d of \u201cBLOM employees\u201d to demonstrate the \nbank\u2019s knowledge; (2) the circuit court rejected those \nstandards on appeal\u2014including the direct evidence re-\nquirement\u2014and \u201cclarified\u201d the correct ones; (3) the cir-\ncuit court found that Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations were none-\ntheless too \u201climited\u201d to meet the clarified standards, \ndrawing a newly announced distinction between \nPlaintiffs\u2019 \u201cpublicly available\u201d evidence and \u201cpublic \nsources such as media articles,\u201d Pet.App.50 & n.18; (4) \nthe circuit court identified several remediable defects \n\n \n \n \n \n \n3 \n \nin the complaint that the district court had not, such \nas clarifying that cash withdrawals are untraceable \nand alleging the degree to which Israeli terrorism des-\nignations were publicized; and (5) Plaintiffs had not \nyet amended their complaint even once. In these one-\nof-a-kind circumstances, the Rules\u2019 strong preference \nfor deciding cases on their merits entitles Plaintiffs to \nhave at least one opportunity to cure those defects. \nBLOM\u2019s argument is therefore premised on con-\nstruing the case\u2019s procedural history to suggest the \nSecond Circuit found that Plaintiffs \u201cwaived\u201d their \nright to amend post-judgment but nevertheless \u201cdi-\nrected district courts to override and rescue parties \nfrom their \u2018free, calculated, [and] deliberate choices,\u2019\u201d \nsuch as \u201cwhen the movant has consistently and con-\nsciously rejected numerous invitations and opportuni-\nties to amend.\u201d Pet.Br.28-29 (citations omitted).  \nBut the Second Circuit never accepted BLOM\u2019s \n\u201cwaiver\u201d argument. To the contrary, it recognized that \nPlaintiffs did not have a meaningful opportunity to \namend at all because \u201cthe district court applied the \nwrong legal standard for aiding-and-abetting liability \nunder JASTA,\u201d Pet.App.5, and a standard for pleading \nknowledge that was \u201ctoo exacting,\u201d Pet.App.49. In fact, \nthe district court\u2019s knowledge pleading standard was \nunmeetable\u2014as Circuit Court Judge Wesley noted in \nresponse to BLOM\u2019s insistence at oral argument that \nPlaintiffs waived opportunities to amend: \u201cWhat are \nthey supposed to do? They know they can\u2019t amend [to] \n. . . meet that.\u201d Oral Arg. at 11:52-:56, Honickman, No. \n22-1039 (2d Cir. Oct. 5, 2023), https://ww3.ca2. \nuscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/6a33dfa3-27c7-4b0a-\n82ee-86c41553c09a/1/doc/22-1039.mp3. \nIgnoring this, BLOM further insists that \u201cthe Sec-\nond Circuit affirmed the dismissal on grounds that the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n4 \n \nDistrict Court had relied on,\u201d Pet.Br. 40\u2014but the dis-\ntrict court itself acknowledged that the decision was \naffirmed \u201con other grounds.\u201d Pet.App.10. Most im-\nportantly, BLOM\u2019s reading of the record is irrelevant \nto the question presented\u2014the summary order below \nwas not premised on any such finding and thus did not \ndirect district courts to \u201coverride\u201d waivers.  \nThe unusual procedural history of this case makes \nclear that no meaningful opportunities to satisfy the \ncorrect legal standards were available to Plaintiffs and \ntherefore the remand to the district court was not a \ndeparture from Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s long-recognized stand-\nards. Rather, in the Second Circuit parties who de-\nclined meaningful invitations \u201care not entitled to relief \nfrom the judgment.\u201d Metzler Inv. GmbH v. Chipotle \nMexican Grill, Inc., 970 F.3d 133, 148 (2d Cir. 2020).  \nThis is not unusual\u2014the circuits broadly require \ndistrict courts to provide at least one opportunity to \namend, often after dismissal when the complaint\u2019s re-\nmediable defects, if any, are correctly identified by a \ncourt ruling. Refusing leave to amend after dismissal \nis thus often an abuse of discretion\u2014the result is no \ndifferent here, except that Plaintiffs were compelled to \nappeal the district court\u2019s erroneous decision first. \nSTATEMENT \nI. \nThe Complaint and Pre-Motion Conference \nfor BLOM\u2019s Motion to Dismiss \nPlaintiffs filed their complaint on January 1, 2019, \nasserting claims under the Anti-Terrorism Act \n(\u201cATA\u201d), as amended by the Justice Against Sponsors \nof Terrorism Act (\u201cJASTA\u201d), and alleging that BLOM \naided and abetted a series of terrorist attacks commit-\nted by the Palestinian foreign terrorist organization \n(\u201cFTO\u201d) Hamas (or \u201cHAMAS\u201d) that injured Plaintiffs. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n5 \n \nSpecifically, Plaintiffs alleged that BLOM knowingly \nprovided substantial assistance to three Hamas fund-\nraisers (the \u201cThree Customers\u201d), including the pur-\nported charitable institution Sanabil, which the \nUnited States designated a Specially Designated \nGlobal Terrorist (\u201cSDGT\u201d) in 2003. Relying in part on \nfinancial records disclosed during the criminal trial of \nthe Holy Land Foundation (\u201cHLF,\u201d a notorious Hamas \nfundraiser) in Texas, Plaintiffs alleged that BLOM as-\nsisted the Three Customers in converting millions of \ndollars of donations from HLF and other Hamas sup-\nporters abroad into cash (notwithstanding BLOM\u2019s de-\nscription of its services as \u201croutine,\u201d Pet.Br.5-6), which \nthey used, inter alia, to recruit Palestinians living in \nLebanon to join and support Hamas before and during \nthe \u201cSecond Intifada,\u201d when the acts of terrorism at is-\nsue here occurred.  \nPlaintiffs alleged BLOM\u2019s knowledge by \u201crefer-\nences to media articles and publications on the Three \nCustomers\u2019 connection to Hamas.\u201d Pet.App.49. Plain-\ntiffs also alleged that Sanabil\u2019s board included contem-\nporaneous Hamas leaders in Lebanon. JA.105, 114. \nPlaintiffs alleged that Israel designated another one of \nthe Three Customers, the Union of Good, as \u201cpart of \nthe Hamas organization\u201d in 2002, during the relevant \nperiod (1998-2004, JA.82). JA.118. The Union of \nGood\u2019s infamous leader, Sheikh Qaradawi, regularly \nappeared on television during that period extolling the \nvirtues of suicide bombings against Israel. JA.120.  \nPlaintiffs also alleged that BLOM converted mil-\nlions of dollars for the Three Customers from not only \nHLF, but also from its successor KindHearts after the \nUnited States designated HLF an SDGT in 2001, \nJA.99-100, 106-13, 117, and from Al Aqsa Foundation \nafter Israel designated it a Hamas entity and its \n\n \n \n \n \n \n6 \n \nheadquarters were shuttered by the German govern-\nment\u2014and one transaction after the United States \ndesignated it an SDGT. JA.95-96, 113.  \nOn May 3, 2019, BLOM filed a letter requesting a \npre-motion conference to initiate a motion to dismiss \nthe complaint for failure to state a claim, setting forth \na summary of its anticipated arguments. JA.142-47. \nThese arguments, which the district court later \nadopted in dismissing the complaint, were incon-\nsistent with JASTA\u2019s plain language, the interpreta-\ntive guidance in Halberstam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472 \n(D.C. Cir. 1983)\u2014which Congress set as the legal \nframework for JASTA\u2014and the Second Circuit\u2019s then-\nonly prior JASTA ruling in Linde v. Arab Bank, PLC, \n882 F.3d 314 (2d Cir. 2018).  \nPlaintiffs provided a summary of their anticipated \nopposition in a letter on May 8, 2019. JA.148-55. Spe-\ncifically, Plaintiffs relied on the standards from both \nLinde and Halberstam and noted that foreseeability \nwas the key factor in assessing a defendant\u2019s wrongful \nconduct under JASTA. As shown below, the district \ncourt ultimately adopted BLOM\u2019s arguments and re-\njected foreseeability. See Pet.App.71-72. The Second \nCircuit subsequently vindicated Plaintiffs\u2019 analysis, as \ndid this Court four years later. See Twitter, Inc. v. \nTaamneh, 598 U.S. 471, 496 (2023).  \nThe district court held a pre-motion conference on \nMay 15, 2019. After raising sua sponte whether BLOM \nhad an affirmative defense based on the statute of lim-\nitations, Pet.App.91, the court then stated:  \nI am just wondering if it might be prudent to \nallow the plaintiffs to amend their complaint, \nnot to add more claims, not to add more parties, \nbut rather to factually support some of the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n7 \n \nclaims that [defense counsel] have identified as \nbeing deficient regarding the standards that \nwere adopted by [Linde] from [Halberstam]. \n[Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel], do you want that oppor-\ntunity?  \nPet.App.93. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel responded, \u201cNo, I think \nwe are prepared to brief it based on the arguments pre-\nsented in [our] pre-motion letter.\u201d Id. This position was \nappropriate given that Plaintiffs\u2019 readings of Linde \nand Halberstam were substantively correct, whereas \nBLOM\u2019s contrary positions were not. \nFollowing the pre-motion conference, the district \ncourt issued a Minute Entry and Scheduling Order \nnoting: \u201cThe Court offered Plaintiffs an opportunity to \namend their complaint to add additional information \nin response to the arguments raised by Defendant. \nPlaintiffs declined . . . to amend their Complaint in \nthis regard.\u201d JA.156 (emphasis added). That is, the \ndistrict court offered Plaintiffs the opportunity to meet \nBLOM\u2019s urged legal standards, which they reasonably \ndeclined\u2014as shown by the circuit\u2019s later \u201cclarification\u201d \nof the applicable standards. \nII. \nThe Motion to Dis\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n2: 20250108172215073_No.2023-125920Osen20LLC20COC.json (score: 0.344)\nNo. 23-1259\n\nINTue\nSupreme Court of the United States\nBLOM Bak SAL\n\nPetitioner,\n\nMICHAL HONICKMAN, ET AL.\nRespondent.\n\nOn Writ of Certiorari\nto the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Second Circuit\n\nBRIEF FOR RESPONDENTS:\n\nCERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE\n\nAs required by Supreme Court Rule 33.1(h), I certify that the document contains\n12,993 words, excluding the parts of the document that are exempted by Supreme Court\nRule 33.1(2).\n\nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.\n\n\u2018Sworn to and subscribed before me this 8th day sf January 2\n\nMy commission expires April 30, 2029.\n\n20: 20250108172209078_No.2023-125920Osen20LLC20COS.json (score: 0.343)\nE-Mail Address: 1115 H Street, NE.\nfae Driefs@wilsonepes.com Washington, D.C. 20002\n\nWeb Site: \u2018Tal (202) 789.0096\nwo \u2018wor wilsonepes.com Fax (202) 842-4896\nNo. 28-1259\nBLOM BANK SAL\nPetitioner,\n\nMICHAL HONICKMAN, ET AL.\nRespondents.\n\nAFFIDAVIT OF SERVICE\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that on January 8, 2025, three (9) copies of the BRIEF FOR\nRESPONDENTS in the abovecaptioned case were served, as required by US.

Circuit courts generally hold that \nmeans providing an opportunity to amend once a ruling \nidentifies remediable defects, if any, in a pleading. Fail-\ning to provide that opportunity may constitute an \u201cex-\ntraordinary circumstance\u201d and a basis to vacate a judg-\nment under Rule 60(b)(6).  \nHere, the Second Circuit found that the district \ncourt dismissed Respondents\u2019 complaint by applying \nthe \u201cwrong legal standard\u201d for pleading an aiding and \nabetting claim (in the Second Circuit) under the Justice \nAgainst Sponsors of Terrorism Act, as well as a stand-\nard for pleading knowledge that was \u201ctoo exacting\u201d and \nall but impossible to meet by amendment. The circuit \ncourt provided clarified pleading standards and identi-\nfied specific, remediable defects in the complaint. Re-\nspondents then promptly moved to vacate the district \ncourt\u2019s judgment in order to meet those clarified stand-\nards in an amended complaint\u2014their first in this litiga-\ntion. The district court refused and, after Respondents \nappealed again, the circuit issued a non-precedential \nsummary order remanding the case for \u201crecon-\nsider[ation].\u201d \nThe question presented is thus whether the circuit \ncourt erred in directing the district court to reconsider \nits refusal to grant Respondents an opportunity to meet \nthe pleading standards the circuit corrected in the prior \nappeal. \n \n \n\nii \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \nQUESTION PRESENTED ............................................. i \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES ......................................... iv \nINTRODUCTION .......................................................... 1 \nSTATEMENT ................................................................ 4 \nI. \nThe Complaint and Pre-Motion Conference for \nBLOM\u2019s Motion to Dismiss .............................. 4 \nII. \nThe Motion to Dismiss ..................................... 7 \nIII.

The dis-\ntrict court had denied vacatur because Plaintiffs de-\nclined its pre-dismissal invitations to amend their \ncomplaint\u2014but the circuit court found the district \ncourt was applying the \u201cwrong\u201d pleading standards, \nPet.App.5, which were so overly \u201cexacting\u201d that Plain-\ntiffs could not meet them before discovery, Pet.App.49.  \nPetitioner (\u201cBLOM\u201d) argues that by making this \nstraightforward remand, the Second Circuit has effec-\ntively \u201cabandon[ed] the \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 \nstandard in favor of a nebulous \u2018balanc[ing]\u2019 inquiry \nthat pits Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s protection of \u2018finality\u2019 against \n\u2018Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policies.\u2019\u201d Pet.Br.25 \n(quoting Pet.App.8). In BLOM\u2019s telling, the Second \nCircuit has \u201cjettisoned\u201d Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s guardrails, \nPet.Br.14., and motions for post-judgment amend-\nments will now be all but rubber-stamped in the cir-\ncuit. This is incorrect. \nFirst of all, this conclusion is not supported by the \nspare language of the summary order, which simply \ndirects the district court to \u201creconsider\u201d denying vaca-\ntur given Second Circuit and Supreme Court prece-\ndents. Nothing has been \u201cabandoned\u201d\u2014consistent \nwith decisions from this Court, \u201c[r]elief under Rule \n60(b)(6)\u201d in the Second Circuit \u201cis reserved for cases \nthat present \u2018extraordinary circumstances,\u2019\u201d including \nwhere a party seeks post-judgment amendment. Man-\ndala v. NTT Data, Inc., 88 F.4th 353, 361 (2d Cir. 2023) \n(citation omitted). Indeed, the standards the Second \n\n \n \n \n \n \n2 \n \nCircuit has \u201cdeveloped\u201d\u2014and reaffirmed by the sum-\nmary order below\u2014\u201cfor evaluating postjudgment mo-\ntions generally place significant emphasis on the \n\u2018value of finality and repose.\u2019\u201d Williams v. Citigroup \nInc., 659 F.3d 208, 213 (2d Cir. 2011) (citation omit-\nted). \nSecond, balancing finality and justice is not \u201cnebu-\nlous,\u201d as BLOM calls it, but rather inherent to Rule \n60(b)(6) jurisprudence: The rule\u2019s \u201cextraordinary cir-\ncumstances\u201d requirement \u201cexists in order to balance \nthe broad language of Rule 60(b)(6), which allows \ncourts to set aside judgments for \u2018any\u2019 reason justify-\ning relief, with the interest in the finality of judg-\nments.\u201d Budget Blinds, Inc. v. White, 536 F.3d 244, \n255 (3d Cir. 2008). When considering a motion to \namend a complaint, finality interests are \u201cbalance[d] \n. . . with the preference expressed in the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure in general, and Rule 15 in particu-\nlar, for resolving disputes on their merits.\u201d Krupski v. \nCosta Crociere S. p. A., 560 U.S. 538, 550 (2010).  \nThird, this case does involve truly \u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d because (1) the district court dismissed \nthe complaint using a set of \u201cwrong legal standards,\u201d \nincluding the nearly impossible requirement of alleg-\ning, without the opportunity for any discovery, \u201cacts or \nstatements\u201d of \u201cBLOM employees\u201d to demonstrate the \nbank\u2019s knowledge; (2) the circuit court rejected those \nstandards on appeal\u2014including the direct evidence re-\nquirement\u2014and \u201cclarified\u201d the correct ones; (3) the cir-\ncuit court found that Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations were none-\ntheless too \u201climited\u201d to meet the clarified standards, \ndrawing a newly announced distinction between \nPlaintiffs\u2019 \u201cpublicly available\u201d evidence and \u201cpublic \nsources such as media articles,\u201d Pet.App.50 & n.18; (4) \nthe circuit court identified several remediable defects \n\n \n \n \n \n \n3 \n \nin the complaint that the district court had not, such \nas clarifying that cash withdrawals are untraceable \nand alleging the degree to which Israeli terrorism des-\nignations were publicized; and (5) Plaintiffs had not \nyet amended their complaint even once. In these one-\nof-a-kind circumstances, the Rules\u2019 strong preference \nfor deciding cases on their merits entitles Plaintiffs to \nhave at least one opportunity to cure those defects. \nBLOM\u2019s argument is therefore premised on con-\nstruing the case\u2019s procedural history to suggest the \nSecond Circuit found that Plaintiffs \u201cwaived\u201d their \nright to amend post-judgment but nevertheless \u201cdi-\nrected district courts to override and rescue parties \nfrom their \u2018free, calculated, [and] deliberate choices,\u2019\u201d \nsuch as \u201cwhen the movant has consistently and con-\nsciously rejected numerous invitations and opportuni-\nties to amend.\u201d Pet.Br.28-29 (citations omitted).  \nBut the Second Circuit never accepted BLOM\u2019s \n\u201cwaiver\u201d argument. To the contrary, it recognized that \nPlaintiffs did not have a meaningful opportunity to \namend at all because \u201cthe district court applied the \nwrong legal standard for aiding-and-abetting liability \nunder JASTA,\u201d Pet.App.5, and a standard for pleading \nknowledge that was \u201ctoo exacting,\u201d Pet.App.49. In fact, \nthe district court\u2019s knowledge pleading standard was \nunmeetable\u2014as Circuit Court Judge Wesley noted in \nresponse to BLOM\u2019s insistence at oral argument that \nPlaintiffs waived opportunities to amend: \u201cWhat are \nthey supposed to do? They know they can\u2019t amend [to] \n. . . meet that.\u201d Oral Arg. at 11:52-:56, Honickman, No. \n22-1039 (2d Cir. Oct. 5, 2023), https://ww3.ca2. \nuscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/6a33dfa3-27c7-4b0a-\n82ee-86c41553c09a/1/doc/22-1039.mp3. \nIgnoring this, BLOM further insists that \u201cthe Sec-\nond Circuit affirmed the dismissal on grounds that the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n4 \n \nDistrict Court had relied on,\u201d Pet.Br. 40\u2014but the dis-\ntrict court itself acknowledged that the decision was \naffirmed \u201con other grounds.\u201d Pet.App.10. Most im-\nportantly, BLOM\u2019s reading of the record is irrelevant \nto the question presented\u2014the summary order below \nwas not premised on any such finding and thus did not \ndirect district courts to \u201coverride\u201d waivers.  \nThe unusual procedural history of this case makes \nclear that no meaningful opportunities to satisfy the \ncorrect legal standards were available to Plaintiffs and \ntherefore the remand to the district court was not a \ndeparture from Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s long-recognized stand-\nards. Rather, in the Second Circuit parties who de-\nclined meaningful invitations \u201care not entitled to relief \nfrom the judgment.\u201d Metzler Inv. GmbH v. Chipotle \nMexican Grill, Inc., 970 F.3d 133, 148 (2d Cir. 2020).  \nThis is not unusual\u2014the circuits broadly require \ndistrict courts to provide at least one opportunity to \namend, often after dismissal when the complaint\u2019s re-\nmediable defects, if any, are correctly identified by a \ncourt ruling. Refusing leave to amend after dismissal \nis thus often an abuse of discretion\u2014the result is no \ndifferent here, except that Plaintiffs were compelled to \nappeal the district court\u2019s erroneous decision first. \nSTATEMENT \nI. \nThe Complaint and Pre-Motion Conference \nfor BLOM\u2019s Motion to Dismiss \nPlaintiffs filed their complaint on January 1, 2019, \nasserting claims under the Anti-Terrorism Act \n(\u201cATA\u201d), as amended by the Justice Against Sponsors \nof Terrorism Act (\u201cJASTA\u201d), and alleging that BLOM \naided and abetted a series of terrorist attacks commit-\nted by the Palestinian foreign terrorist organization \n(\u201cFTO\u201d) Hamas (or \u201cHAMAS\u201d) that injured Plaintiffs. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n5 \n \nSpecifically, Plaintiffs alleged that BLOM knowingly \nprovided substantial assistance to three Hamas fund-\nraisers (the \u201cThree Customers\u201d), including the pur-\nported charitable institution Sanabil, which the \nUnited States designated a Specially Designated \nGlobal Terrorist (\u201cSDGT\u201d) in 2003. Relying in part on \nfinancial records disclosed during the criminal trial of \nthe Holy Land Foundation (\u201cHLF,\u201d a notorious Hamas \nfundraiser) in Texas, Plaintiffs alleged that BLOM as-\nsisted the Three Customers in converting millions of \ndollars of donations from HLF and other Hamas sup-\nporters abroad into cash (notwithstanding BLOM\u2019s de-\nscription of its services as \u201croutine,\u201d Pet.Br.5-6), which \nthey used, inter alia, to recruit Palestinians living in \nLebanon to join and support Hamas before and during \nthe \u201cSecond Intifada,\u201d when the acts of terrorism at is-\nsue here occurred.  \nPlaintiffs alleged BLOM\u2019s knowledge by \u201crefer-\nences to media articles and publications on the Three \nCustomers\u2019 connection to Hamas.\u201d Pet.App.49. Plain-\ntiffs also alleged that Sanabil\u2019s board included contem-\nporaneous Hamas leaders in Lebanon. JA.105, 114. \nPlaintiffs alleged that Israel designated another one of \nthe Three Customers, the Union of Good, as \u201cpart of \nthe Hamas organization\u201d in 2002, during the relevant \nperiod (1998-2004, JA.82). JA.118. The Union of \nGood\u2019s infamous leader, Sheikh Qaradawi, regularly \nappeared on television during that period extolling the \nvirtues of suicide bombings against Israel. JA.120.  \nPlaintiffs also alleged that BLOM converted mil-\nlions of dollars for the Three Customers from not only \nHLF, but also from its successor KindHearts after the \nUnited States designated HLF an SDGT in 2001, \nJA.99-100, 106-13, 117, and from Al Aqsa Foundation \nafter Israel designated it a Hamas entity and its \n\n \n \n \n \n \n6 \n \nheadquarters were shuttered by the German govern-\nment\u2014and one transaction after the United States \ndesignated it an SDGT. JA.95-96, 113.  \nOn May 3, 2019, BLOM filed a letter requesting a \npre-motion conference to initiate a motion to dismiss \nthe complaint for failure to state a claim, setting forth \na summary of its anticipated arguments. JA.142-47. \nThese arguments, which the district court later \nadopted in dismissing the complaint, were incon-\nsistent with JASTA\u2019s plain language, the interpreta-\ntive guidance in Halberstam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472 \n(D.C. Cir. 1983)\u2014which Congress set as the legal \nframework for JASTA\u2014and the Second Circuit\u2019s then-\nonly prior JASTA ruling in Linde v. Arab Bank, PLC, \n882 F.3d 314 (2d Cir. 2018).  \nPlaintiffs provided a summary of their anticipated \nopposition in a letter on May 8, 2019. JA.148-55. Spe-\ncifically, Plaintiffs relied on the standards from both \nLinde and Halberstam and noted that foreseeability \nwas the key factor in assessing a defendant\u2019s wrongful \nconduct under JASTA. As shown below, the district \ncourt ultimately adopted BLOM\u2019s arguments and re-\njected foreseeability. See Pet.App.71-72. The Second \nCircuit subsequently vindicated Plaintiffs\u2019 analysis, as \ndid this Court four years later. See Twitter, Inc. v. \nTaamneh, 598 U.S. 471, 496 (2023).  \nThe district court held a pre-motion conference on \nMay 15, 2019. After raising sua sponte whether BLOM \nhad an affirmative defense based on the statute of lim-\nitations, Pet.App.91, the court then stated:  \nI am just wondering if it might be prudent to \nallow the plaintiffs to amend their complaint, \nnot to add more claims, not to add more parties, \nbut rather to factually support some of the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n7 \n \nclaims that [defense counsel] have identified as \nbeing deficient regarding the standards that \nwere adopted by [Linde] from [Halberstam]. \n[Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel], do you want that oppor-\ntunity?  \nPet.App.93. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel responded, \u201cNo, I think \nwe are prepared to brief it based on the arguments pre-\nsented in [our] pre-motion letter.\u201d Id. This position was \nappropriate given that Plaintiffs\u2019 readings of Linde \nand Halberstam were substantively correct, whereas \nBLOM\u2019s contrary positions were not. \nFollowing the pre-motion conference, the district \ncourt issued a Minute Entry and Scheduling Order \nnoting: \u201cThe Court offered Plaintiffs an opportunity to \namend their complaint to add additional information \nin response to the arguments raised by Defendant. \nPlaintiffs declined . . . to amend their Complaint in \nthis regard.\u201d JA.156 (emphasis added). That is, the \ndistrict court offered Plaintiffs the opportunity to meet \nBLOM\u2019s urged legal standards, which they reasonably \ndeclined\u2014as shown by the circuit\u2019s later \u201cclarification\u201d \nof the applicable standards. \nII. \nThe Motion to Dismiss \nThe parties then briefed the motion to dismiss, in \nwhich they presented arguments largely consistent \nwith the summaries set forth in their pre-motion let-\nters.  \nDuring oral argument on the motion to dismiss, \nBLOM\u2019s counsel relied heavily on a district court deci-\nsion, Kaplan v. Lebanese Canadian Bank, SAL, 405 F. \nSupp. 3d 525 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (\u201cKaplan I\u201d), vac\u2019d in rel-\nevant part, 999 F.3d 842 (2d Cir. 2021) (\u201cKaplan II\u201d). \nKaplan I dismissed JASTA claims against Lebanese \nCanadian Bank (\u201cLCB\u201d), premised on allegations that \n\n \n \n \n \n \n8 \n \nLCB provided financial services for the terrorist group \nHezbollah. As BLOM pointed out, BLOM allegedly \nprovided financial services for Hamas fundraisers in \nLebanon much as LCB did for entities controlled by \nHezbollah. Pet.App.131. \nBLOM urged the district court to adopt Kaplan I\u2019s \nerroneous pleading standards\u2014including its unwork-\nable standard for pleading scienter. Under that stand-\nard, the Kaplan I district court held that public state-\nments and media reports tying five of LCB\u2019s customers \nto Hezbollah could not support an inference of LCB\u2019s \nknowledge of those ties because \u201cPlaintiffs nowhere al-\nlege . . . that Defendant read or was aware of such \nsources.\u201d 405 F. Supp. 3d at 535. Naturally, before dis-\ncovery, a plaintiff will rarely be able to find support for \nwhat sources a defendant has actually \u201cread\u201d or was \naware of. See Pet.App.50 n.18 (\u201cpublic sources\u201d can \n\u201cplausibly suggest a defendant\u2019s knowledge which can \nbe confirmed during discovery\u201d) (emphasis added).  \nNonetheless, BLOM\u2019s counsel argued: \nFinally, I wanted to point out that the level of \nknowledge that Judge Daniels rejected in \nKaplan [I] was very much what\u2019s claimed here, \nwhere it said that it was notorious that there \nwere links between the accounts at issue there, \nbetween those persons and in that case, Hezbol-\nlah. And that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s said here. It was \napparently notorious that BLOM should have \nknown that these accounts were linked to HA-\nMAS, but there\u2019s no direct allegation of why \nBLOM should have known that.  \nPet.App.131. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel disagreed, arguing \n\u201cKaplan [I] requires a level of proof that is out of step \n\n \n \n \n \n \n9 \n \nwith JASTA, out of step with Linde and would be im-\npossible to meet.\u201d Pet.App.126.  \nDuring the oral argument, the district court again \nasked: \u201cThere are no facts that you would have to offer \nto address some of the contentions of the defendants \nregarding knowledge, especially?\u201d Pet.App.125 (em-\nphasis added). But these \u201ccontentions\u201d premised on \nKaplan I were impossible to meet on amendment\u2014\nPlaintiffs possessed no evidence that any BLOM em-\nployee \u201cread or was aware of\u201d any specific piece of in-\nformation. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel explained that while \nthey \u201ccould always add allegations, . . . the complaint \ngoes far enough in saying that BLOM holding accounts \nfor Specially Designated Global Terrorists designated \nfor . . . financing HAMAS, was generally aware of its \nrole in that [il]licit conduct, and . . . the violence that \nresulted from it was foreseeable\u201d as set forth in Linde. \nId. \nIII. \nThe District Court\u2019s Decision on the Motion \nto Dismiss and First Appeal \nThe district court granted BLOM\u2019s motion to dis-\nmiss on January 14, 2020 (\u201cHonickman I\u201d), largely on \nthe grounds BLOM raised, including\u2014as BLOM \nurged\u2014by relying heavily on Kaplan I. The district \ncourt called Kaplan I \u201ca more appropriate comparison\u201d \nand \u201ca more appropriate point of reference\u201d than other \nJASTA and ATA cases to which Plaintiffs analogized \ntheir complaint. Pet.App.77, 84.  \nFor example, and of particular importance to the \nquestion presented here, the district court adopted \nKaplan I\u2019s \u201cread-or-was-aware-of\u201d standard for plead-\ning knowledge. The district court explained that in \nKaplan I, \n\n \n \n \n \n \n10 \n \nalthough the plaintiffs argued that the entities\u2019 \nconnections to Hizbollah \u201cwas [sic] openly, pub-\nlicly and repeatedly acknowledged and publi-\ncized by Hizbollah [through its own sources]\u201d \nand \u201cin various English-language publications,\u201d \nthe plaintiffs \u201cnowhere allege[d] . . . that [LCB] \nread or was aware of such sources.\u201d The same \nanalysis applies even more strongly here, given \nthe relatively greater strength of the allegations \nin Kaplan [I]. \nPet.App.79 (quoting Kaplan I, 405 F. Supp. 3d at 535) \n(emphasis added). Having adopted this position, the \ndistrict court then faulted Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint for \nlacking allegations citing \u201cacts or statements by \nBLOM or BLOM\u2019s employees\u201d regarding its customers\u2019 \naffiliations with Hamas, instead relying on \u201cpress ar-\nticles, government actions, and allegedly \u2018public \nknowledge\u2019 discussing\u201d such connections. Pet.App.73-\n74.  \nUnsurprisingly, financial institutions do not often \npublicly admit their knowledge of their roles in assist-\ning terrorism. Therefore, moving to amend after dis-\nmissal in this case\u2014or accepting the district court\u2019s in-\nvitations to amend, such as during oral argument \nwhere BLOM demanded \u201cdirect allegation[s]\u201d of its \nknowledge, Pet.App.131\u2014would have been pointless. \nAnd while the Second Circuit also ultimately found \nPlaintiffs\u2019 allegations of BLOM\u2019s knowledge of the \nThree Customers\u2019 Hamas affiliations insufficient, it \ndid so for reasons that could be remedied by replead-\ning\u2014such as by pleading more allegations of (1) \u201cpub-\nlic sources\u201d demonstrating that Israeli terrorism des-\nignations were made public, (2) banks\u2019 policies for \nmonitoring counterparties, and (3) the untraceable na-\nture of cash. None of those grounds required alleging \n\n \n \n \n \n \n11 \n \nBLOM\u2019s internal communications or deliberations at \nthe pleading stage showing that BLOM \u201cread or was \naware\u201d of such sources.  \nPlaintiffs timely appealed the district court\u2019s dis-\nmissal decision. Because Kaplan I was also on appeal, \nthe Second Circuit held Honickman in abeyance and \ndirected the parties to submit supplemental briefs on \nthe \u201cissue of how [Kaplan] applies to this case,\u201d once \ndecided. JA.257-258. The circuit subsequently issued \nKaplan II, vacating Kaplan I\u2019s dismissal of JASTA aid-\ning and abetting claims against LCB. See 999 F.3d \n842. Kaplan II largely clarified the standards for \nJASTA liability, as Plaintiffs explained in their sup-\nplemental brief. JA.259-281. BLOM, however, argued \nthat Kaplan II somehow \u201cunderscore[d] the soundness \nof the District Court\u2019s legal analysis,\u201d despite vacating \nits primary support\u2014Kaplan I. JA.294. The circuit \nthen issued its first decision in Honickman on July 29, \n2021 (\u201cHonickman II\u201d). \nIV. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s Assessment of the Dis-\ntrict Court\u2019s Dismissal Decision  \nThe Second Circuit \u201cagree[d]\u201d with Plaintiffs \u201cthat \nthe [district] court did not apply the proper standard \n. . . .\u201d Pet.App.24. Specifically, the circuit rejected \nevery standard the district court applied as grounds \nfor dismissal, including the direct-evidence standard \nfor alleging BLOM\u2019s knowledge of the Three Custom-\ners\u2019 affiliations with Hamas. It also rejected the dis-\ntrict court\u2019s standards for alleging the general aware-\nness and substantial assistance elements, which to-\ngether \u201cform the crux of most JASTA aiding-and-abet-\nting cases.\u201d Pet.App.37. These holdings are detailed \nbelow. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n12 \n \nBLOM \nlargely \nignores \nthese \nholdings. \nSee \nPet.Br.40. But the district court was more forthcom-\ning\u2014it acknowledged that the circuit court only af-\nfirmed on \u201cother grounds.\u201d Pet.App.10. BLOM also \ntries to rehabilitate the district court\u2019s dismissal order \nby suggesting it conforms to this Court\u2019s analysis in \nTaamneh. See Pet.Br.6-7, 8 n.2. But, of course, \nTaamneh affirmed the foreseeability standard from \nHalberstam\u2014the Honickman district court, \u201chowever, \nrejected the foreseeability principle.\u201d Pet.App.39.  \nMoreover, Taamneh had not been issued when \nPlaintiffs sought post-judgment amendment to meet \nthe Second Circuit\u2019s \u201cclarifications\u201d in Kaplan II and \nHonickman II. The issue in this case is the standard \nfor post-judgment amendment where a district court \nhas misapplied controlling law\u2014that is, the law of the \ncircuit. And even if Taamneh had completely repudi-\nated the Second Circuit\u2019s interpretation of JASTA, \nthat would only have provided a further reason to af-\nford Plaintiffs an opportunity to meet this Court\u2019s \nnewly-articulated standard. \nA. The District Court Applied the Wrong \nStandard for Pleading Knowledge \nThe most decisive problem with the district court\u2019s \ndismissal decision was its articulated standard for \npleading knowledge, which required Plaintiffs to al-\nlege \u201cacts or statements by BLOM or BLOM\u2019s employ-\nees\u201d showing their knowledge. Pet.App.73. The Second \nCircuit explained why this standard was incorrect:  \nIn assessing this element, the district court \nfound that the complaint\u2019s references to media \narticles and publications on the Three Custom-\ners\u2019 connection to Hamas were insufficient be-\ncause \u201cPlaintiffs fail[ed] plausibly to allege that \n\n \n \n \n \n \n13 \n \nBLOM [Bank] . . . actually knew or should have \nknown of any of the cited sources.\u201d However, as \nwe explained in Kaplan [II], Plaintiffs did not \nneed to allege that BLOM Bank knew or should \nhave known of the public sources at the plead-\ning stage. Such a requirement at this juncture \nwould be too exacting. \nPet.App.49 (citations omitted). \nThe district court had adopted its erroneous stand-\nard from Kaplan I, before it was vacated in relevant \npart. In Kaplan II, the circuit explained that \u201c[a] com-\nplaint is allowed to contain general allegations as to a \ndefendant\u2019s knowledge because \u2018a plaintiff realistically \ncannot be expected to plead a defendant\u2019s actual state \nof mind,\u2019\u201d although plaintiffs must \u201cinclude allegations \nof the facts or events they claim give rise to an infer-\nence of knowledge.\u201d 999 F.3d at 864 (citations omit-\nted). Moreover, the district court must \u201cconsider all of \nthe complaint\u2019s allegations, rather than considering \neach in isolation, and to accept as true all permissible \ninferences that could be drawn from the complaint as \na whole.\u201d Id. at 865.1  \nThis correction is critical. While Plaintiffs\u2019 pro-\nposed amended complaint submitted in support of \n \n1  \nThe Honickman district court also echoed Kaplan I in \npointing out that with one exception cited in the complaint, the \nU.S. did not designate the Three Customers or their counterpar-\nties as SDGTs until after the transfers at issue (although Israel \nhad designated several of the counterparties as terrorist organi-\nzations years before). See Pet.App.74-75. The circuit rejected this \nstandard in Kaplan II as well, writing: \u201cThe [Kaplan I] court cited \nno authority for such a prerequisite for knowledge, and we know \nof none; and it would defy common sense to hold that such \nknowledge could be gained in no other way.\u201d 999 F.3d at 864. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n14 \n \ntheir vacatur motion contained numerous additional \n\u201cpublic source\u201d allegations (including publications in \nEnglish, French and Arabic) to further support the \n\u201cpermissible inferences\u201d of BLOM\u2019s contemporaneous \nknowledge that it was providing substantial assis-\ntance to Hamas, JA.315-508, those allegations would \nnot satisfy Kaplan I\u2019s \u201cread or was aware of\u201d require-\nment adopted by the district court below. \nB. The District Court Applied the Wrong \nJASTA Standards \nThe Second Circuit also explained that the district \ncourt applied the wrong standards for assessing the \nJASTA elements.  \nAs to general awareness, the Second Circuit first \nset forth the standard given in Halberstam and \nacknowledged in Linde: \u201c[t]he defendant need not be \ngenerally aware of its role in the specific act that \ncaused the plaintiff\u2019s injury; instead, it must be gener-\nally aware of its role in an overall illegal activity from \nwhich the act that caused the plaintiff\u2019s injury was \nforeseeable.\u201d Pet.App.37 (citing Halberstam, 705 F.2d \nat 477, 488). It then explained that the district court \ndid not apply this standard:  \nThe district court, however, rejected the foresee-\nability principle, holding that \u201cit is not enough \nfor Plaintiffs to plausibl[y] allege that BLOM \n[Bank] was generally aware of [its] role in ter-\nrorist activities, from which terrorist attacks \nwere a natural and foreseeable consequence.\u201d \nThe court\u2019s conclusion contravenes both Hal-\nberstam and Linde[], one of the first cases in \nwhich we interpreted aiding-and-abetting lia-\nbility under JASTA. \nPet.App.39 (quoting Pet.App.71-72).  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n15 \n \nIn Taamneh, this Court likewise confirmed that:  \nAs Halberstam makes clear, people who aid and \nabet a tort can be held liable for other torts that \nwere \u201ca foreseeable risk\u201d of the intended \ntort. Accordingly, a close nexus between the as-\nsistance and the tort might help establish that \nthe defendant aided and abetted the tort, but \neven more remote support can still constitute \naiding and abetting in the right case. \n598 U.S. at 496 (quoting Halberstam, 705 F.2d at 488). \nThe Second Circuit rejected BLOM\u2019s argument \nthat providing indirect assistance changes the stand-\nard for pleading knowledge, explaining that \u201cKaplan \n[II] did not so hold; instead, it asserted \u2018the actual \nknowledge component of the Halberstam standard re-\nquires that the defendant \u201cknow[ ]\u201d that it is providing \n\u201cassistance,\u201d . . . whether directly to the FTO or indi-\nrectly through an intermediary.\u2019\u201d Pet.App.46 n.16 \n(quoting Kaplan II, 999 F.3d at 863-64). See also \nPet.App.45 n.15 (rejecting BLOM\u2019s argument regard-\ning customer activities).  \nThe circuit\u2019s Honickman II and Kaplan II decisions \nalso rejected the district court\u2019s assertion that \u201cthe \nmere provision of routine banking services to an FTO \ndoes not render a bank liable for civil aiding and abet-\nting.\u201d Pet.App.71. The Kaplan II court explained that \nso-called \u201croutine\u201d services could suffice depending on \nthe circumstances, and that, under Linde, \u201cwhether a \ndefendant bank\u2019s \u2018financial services to [an FTO or its \naffiliates should or] should not be viewed as routine\u2019 is \na \u2018question[] of fact for a jury to decide.\u2019\u201d 999 F.3d at \n858 (quoting Linde, 882 F.3d at 327) (alterations orig-\ninal to Kaplan II). See also Taamneh, 598 U.S. at 502 \n(noting circumstances \u201cwhere the provider of routine \n\n \n \n \n \n \n16 \n \nservices\u201d could be liable for \u201caiding and abetting a fore-\nseeable terror attack\u201d). \nThe Second Circuit also found that the district \ncourt applied incorrect standards to plead the knowing \nand substantial assistance element. This included \nmisapprehending the \u201cknowing\u201d prong under circuit \nlaw2 and misapplying each of the Halberstam substan-\ntial assistance factors it analyzed. Pet.App.45.  \nThe district court \u201cmisunderstood the first factor, \n\u2018the nature of the act encouraged,\u2019 to be a question of \nwhether Plaintiffs plausibly alleged \u2018that BLOM \n[Bank] knowingly encouraged Hamas\u2019[s] violent activ-\nities, such as those which caused Plaintiffs\u2019 injuries.\u2019\u201d \nPet.App.46. Indeed, the Halberstam defendant did not \n\u201cencourage\u201d her burglar boyfriend to commit the un-\nplanned murder of Dr. Halberstam, of which she had \nno knowledge.  \nThe district court also applied too exacting a stand-\nard for \u201cthe second factor, \u2018the amount of assistance,\u2019\u201d \nrequiring allegations of how the money BLOM moved \nfor Hamas actually made it through the FTO\u2019s fronts. \nTo the contrary, \u201c[f]actual allegations that permit a \nreasonable inference that the defendant recognized \nthe money it transferred to its customers would be re-\nceived by the FTO would suffice.\u201d Pet.App.47. \n \n2  \nThe Second Circuit did not, as some JASTA defendants \nhave suggested, \u201canalyze[] the \u2018knowing\u2019 subelement as a carbon \ncopy of the antecedent element of whether the defendants were \n\u2018generally aware\u2019 of their role in ISIS\u2019 overall scheme.\u201d Taamneh, \n598 U.S. at 503 (citations omitted). It only observed that the same \nfacts could satisfy both mental state elements: \u201cFor instance, Hal-\nberstam . . . . did not require [the defendant] to \u2018know\u2019 anything \nmore about [the murderer\u2019s] unlawful activities than what she \nknew for the general awareness element.\u201d Pet.App.46.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n17 \n \nFinally, under the fourth factor, the defendant\u2019s re-\nlation to the principal, \u201c[t]he district court erroneously \nconstrued\u201d Second Circuit precedent \u201cto mean that \nPlaintiffs must plead a direct relationship between \nBLOM Bank and Hamas.\u201d Pet.App.47-48. A less direct \nrelationship, depending on the circumstances, could \nsuffice. \nAgain, these errors align with BLOM\u2019s \u201cargu-\nments\u201d and \u201ccontentions\u201d to which the district court \ninvited Plaintiffs to respond by amendment. JA.156, \nPet.App.125. Plaintiffs reasonably declined these invi-\ntations, as evidenced by the Second Circuit\u2019s complete \nrejection of them. \nC. The Second Circuit Affirmed the District \nCourt Decision Only on Another Ground \nThe Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal decision \nentirely on one ground: \u201cWe conclude that Plaintiffs\u2019 \naiding-and-abetting claim fails because the allegations \ndo not support an inference that BLOM Bank was \naware of the Three Customers\u2019 ties with Hamas prior \nto the relevant attacks, thereby undermining the sec-\nond element of general awareness.\u201d Pet.App.49. But \nwhereas the district court required allegations of \u201cacts \nor statements\u201d from \u201cBLOM employees\u201d demonstrat-\ning their actual knowledge (which Plaintiffs naturally \ndid not have before discovery), the Second Circuit \nidentified a less exacting set of specific and remediable \ndeficiencies in the complaint\u2019s knowledge allegations. \nChief among these was the circuit\u2019s finding that \nPlaintiffs\u2019 evidence of the Three Customers\u2019 Hamas af-\nfiliations was \u201cpublicly available,\u201d rather than from \n\u201cpublic sources\u201d: \nHowever, \u201cpublicly available\u201d evidence is not \nthe same as public sources such as media \n\n \n \n \n \n \n18 \n \narticles. The latter, depending on their sub-\nstance, \nplausibly \nsuggest \na \ndefendant\u2019s \nknowledge which can be confirmed during dis-\ncovery, whereas the former requires the implau-\nsible inference that the defendant was aware of \nthose facts even before the news media. \nPet.App.50 n.18. The court then went on to find Plain-\ntiffs\u2019 allegations of \u201cpublic sources\u201d too \u201climited\u201d in de-\ntail and numerosity. Pet.App.51. \nPlaintiffs understandably did not anticipate this \nnew evidentiary distinction (the district court cer-\ntainly did not). Moreover, the Second Circuit did not \ncite any precedent for this position, and it is by all ap-\npearances a newly articulated distinction. Nor did the \nKaplan II decision mention any distinction between \n\u201cpublicly available evidence\u201d and \u201cpublic sources\u201d of \nevidence. In fact, \u201cpublicly available evidence\u201d echoes \nthe term the Second Circuit had previously used as a \nbasis for inferring knowledge, relying on this Court\u2019s \nprecedent: \u201cPublicly available information may pro-\nvide relevant circumstantial evidence of actual \nknowledge.\u201d Fed. Hous. Fin. Agency v. Nomura Hold-\ning Am., Inc., 873 F.3d 85, 122 (2d Cir. 2017) (empha-\nsis added) (citing Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa, 539 U.S. \n90, 100 (2003)). Indeed, it seems reasonable that \nbanks, given their unique Know-Your-Customer obli-\ngations and due diligence policies, which assume close \nmonitoring of customer accounts and transactions, \nwould know facts about their customers \u201cbefore the \nnews media\u201d report it (which involves deciding what is \nnewsworthy and what facts are verifiable).  \nBut no matter\u2014Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed amended com-\nplaint included numerous and detailed allegations of \ncontemporaneous \u201cpublic sources\u201d to meet the Second \nCircuit\u2019s requirement.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n19 \n \nThe other defects the circuit identified were also re-\nmediable. For example, the circuit discounted Plain-\ntiffs\u2019 assertion that BLOM must have noticed that the \nThree Customers were receiving funds from desig-\nnated terrorist entities. The circuit noted that the com-\nplaint alleged that Sanabil received transfers from the \n\u201cAl-Aqsa Foundation\u201d after Israel designated it as a \nterrorist organization, but not \u201cwhether and where \nthis [designation] was made public.\u201d Pet.App.52 n.20. \nThe circuit also noted that the complaint needed \u201cfur-\nther allegations\u201d to show that a defendant-bank would \nknow about \u201ctransfers of funds from non-customers as-\nsociated with an FTO to the defendant\u2019s customers.\u201d \nId.  \nThese defects were not due to unreasonable draft-\ning\u2014previous ATA decisions found it reasonable to in-\nfer that a foreign bank would \u201cmonitor publicly avail-\nable information,\u201d including \u201cIsraeli lists of terrorists.\u201d \nWeiss v. Nat\u2019l Westminster Bank PLC, 453 F. Supp. \n2d 609, 627 (E.D.N.Y. 2006) (emphasis added). But the \nproposed amended complaint now includes media re-\nports on the relevant Israeli designations and BLOM\u2019s \nown customer due diligence procedures, such as moni-\ntoring transfer counterparties and non-profit organi-\nzations, which are often used as terror fronts.  \nSimilarly, although Plaintiffs repeatedly empha-\nsized the suspicious nature of Sanabil making large \ncash withdrawals from its BLOM account, the circuit \nsuggesting that the complaint should more explicitly \nallege that cash is \u201cuntraceable.\u201d Pet.App.51 n.19. Alt-\nhough Plaintiffs took that characteristic of cash to be \na reasonable inference rather than a necessary allega-\ntion, they included those explicit allegations in the \nproposed amended complaint. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n20 \n \nV. \nPlaintiffs\u2019 Motion to Vacate and Amend and \nthe Second Appeal \nAs the Second Circuit explained in the summary \norder below, the district court had applied the \u201cwrong \nlegal standards\u201d in dismissing the complaint, so once \n\u201c[a]rmed with this Court\u2019s clarifications, Plaintiffs re-\nturned to the district court,\u201d promptly moving (11 days \nafter Honickman II issued\u2014in fact, before the man-\ndate issued) under Rules 60(b)(6) and 15(a)(2) to va-\ncate the judgment of dismissal and grant them leave \nto file a first amended complaint. JA.315. The district \ncourt denied the motion, concluding that Plaintiffs \nfailed to show extraordinary circumstances chiefly be-\ncause they declined the district court\u2019s two prior invi-\ntations to meet the erroneous and largely impossible \npleading standard BLOM urged and that the district \ncourt erroneously adopted.  \nPlaintiffs again appealed. During argument, Cir-\ncuit Court Judge Wesley\u2014who also authored Honick-\nman II\u2014noted the case constituted an \u201cunusual cir-\ncumstance,\u201d 10/5/2023 Oral Arg. at 3:40, and \u201ca curi-\nous situation,\u201d id. at 10:54, and was \u201cquirky,\u201d id. at \n18:07. And as he recognized, Plaintiffs faced \u201ca wrong \nstandard\u201d \u201cthat\u2019s even harder for them to meet.\u201d Judge \nWesley observed: \u201cWhat are they supposed to do? They \nknow they can\u2019t amend [to] . . . meet that\u201d standard. \nId. at 11:50-56. The dismissal was \u201c[a]ffirmed for a dif-\nferent reason,\u201d as a result of a series of cases \u201cwhere \nthe law was really recasting itself.\u201d Id. at 13:12-38. \nAfter that oral argument in this case, the Second \nCircuit decided Mandala, another \u201cone of the excep-\ntional cases necessitating relief from judgment.\u201d Man-\ndala, 88 F.4th at 365. In Mandala, the plaintiffs \nbrought a putative class action alleging that defendant \nNTT Data\u2019s policy of not hiring people with felony \n\n \n \n \n \n \n21 \n \nconvictions disproportionately harms Black appli-\ncants. See id. at 357. The plaintiffs cited government \nreports showing \u201cBlack people are arrested and incar-\ncerated at higher rates than others.\u201d Id. The district \ncourt dismissed the complaint because it did not show \nthat there was a similar disparity among Black appli-\ncants for NTT\u2019s positions specifically.  \nThe Second Circuit affirmed, \u201cagree[ing] with the \ndistrict court\u201d that the complaint\u2019s statistics did not \nfocus on \u201cappropriate comparator groups.\u201d Id. at 357-\n58 (citation omitted). However, the circuit recognized \n\u201cthat such granular data may be impossible to collect \nwithout discovery,\u201d and that \u201cthe Complaint might \nhave survived dismissal if it had contained allegations \nexplaining \u2018why their chosen national statistics are in \nfact likely to be representative of NTT\u2019s qualified ap-\nplicant pool.\u2019\u201d Id. at 358 (citation omitted). The plain-\ntiffs petitioned for rehearing en banc, and although it \nwas denied, the dissenting judges urged the plaintiffs \nto move for vacatur and leave to amend. The plaintiffs \ndid, and the district court denied the motion.  \nOn appeal, the second Mandala panel acknowl-\nedged that \u201c[i]t wasn\u2019t until this Court\u2019s decision on \nappeal that it became clear what other types of infor-\nmation might suffice at the pleading stage.\u201d Id. at 365. \nAs a result, the panel vacated that denial and re-\nmanded the motion for reconsideration given Foman, \nthe Second Circuit cases Metzler and Williams, and \nother precedents.  \nRecognizing that its \u201cdiscussion of the various con-\nsiderations in Mandala will be particularly helpful to \nthe district court\u2019s analysis\u201d of Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for \nvacatur and leave to amend, the Second Circuit issued \nthe summary order below, likewise citing Foman and \nMetzler. Pet.App.1-8. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n22 \n \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n1. Second Circuit precedent does not meaningfully \ndiffer from other circuits\u2019 post-judgment amendment \nholdings. The summary order below does not \u201chold\u201d \nanything, and the precedents it cites are typical of \nRule 60(b)(6) cases. For example, they uncontrover-\nsially hold that \u201c[r]elief under Rule 60(b)(6) is reserved \nfor cases that present \u2018extraordinary circumstances.\u2019\u201d \nMandala, 88 F.4th at 361 (quoting Liljeberg v. Health \nServs. Acquisition Corp., 486 U.S. 847, 863 (1988)).  \nThis case involves highly exceptional circum-\nstances. The district court applied erroneous stand-\nards for pleading aiding and abetting under JASTA, \nincluding a knowledge pleading standard that was all \nbut impossible to meet. Pet.App.5, 49. Plaintiffs rea-\nsonably declined the district court\u2019s invitation to \namend to meet those erroneous standards. The Second \nCircuit \u201cagree[d]\u201d that those standards were incorrect, \nbut found the complaint did not meet the standards it \n\u201cclarified\u201d on appeal. Pet.App.25, 40 n.11. After the \ndistrict court refused to let Plaintiffs amend their com-\nplaint to meet the clarified standard, the Second Cir-\ncuit directed it to reconsider, given prior precedents. It \ndid not dictate a particular outcome.  \n2. The balancing test the circuit court described is \nalso typical of Rule 60(b)(6) cases. The Second Circuit \nrejects allowing the \u201cliberal amendment policy of Rule \n15(a) to swallow the philosophy favoring finality of \njudgments whole.\u201d Metzler, 970 F.3d at 146 (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted). Rather, the \ntest balances Rule 60(b)\u2019s value of finality \u201cwith the \npreference expressed in the Federal Rules of Civil Pro-\ncedure in general, and Rule 15 in particular, for resolv-\ning disputes on their merits.\u201d Krupski, 560 U.S. at \n550. After all, \u201cthe \u2018whole purpose\u2019 of Rule 60(b) \u2018is to \n\n \n \n \n \n \n23 \n \nmake an exception to finality.\u2019\u201d Buck v. Davis, 580 U.S. \n100, 126 (2017) (citations omitted). \nThe practical effect of that balance is far more mod-\nest than BLOM suggests: \u201cIn the post-judgment con-\ntext, we have indeed given \u2018due regard\u2019 to \u2018the liberal \nspirit of Rule 15\u2019 by ensuring plaintiffs at least one op-\nportunity to replead.\u201d Metzler, 970 F.3d at 146 (quot-\ning Williams, 659 F.3d at 213-14). See also Mandala, \n88 F.4th at 362 (same). Courts regularly recognize the \nimportance of providing plaintiffs an opportunity to \namend their complaints once apprised of actual defects \nin them. Where the dismissal standards are wrong, \nhowever, \u201cthe proper recourse\u201d is an appeal, United \nStates v. Mask of Ka-Nefer-Nefer, 752 F.3d 737, 743 \n(8th Cir. 2014), which Plaintiffs here took. None of \nBLOM\u2019s cited cases suggest that under the circum-\nstances present here Plaintiffs would not be entitled to \namend. \n3. BLOM\u2019s appeal is premised on the unsupported \ninference that the Second Circuit agreed that Plain-\ntiffs \u201cwaived\u201d their opportunities to amend but then \n\u201cdirected district courts to override and rescue parties \nfrom their \u2018free, calculated, [and] deliberate choices.\u2019\u201d \nPet.Br.28-29. But the Second Circuit did not find any \nwaiver. Quite the opposite, it suggested Plaintiffs rea-\nsonably appealed the district court\u2019s dismissal deci-\nsion and never received a meaningful opportunity to \nmeet the correct and newly clarified standards\u2014and \nthus had nothing to waive.  \nBLOM\u2019s litany of \u201cwaived\u201d opportunities to amend \nare not supported by the record and in any event were \nnot accepted by the panel below in discussing post-\njudgment amendment standards. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n24 \n \n4. The Second Circuit\u2019s precedents do not conflict \nwith the text of Rule 60(b) or Rule 15(a). The Second \nCircuit requires determining which Rule 60(b) provi-\nsion applies as a \u201cthreshold issue,\u201d before considering \namendment. Mandala, 88 F.4th at 359. The desire to \namend a complaint itself is insufficient. \n5. Extraordinary circumstances are clearly present \nhere, for the reasons stated above. Plaintiffs were not \nafforded a meaningful opportunity to address actual \ndefects in their complaint. They properly appealed the \ndistrict court\u2019s erroneous decision and then promptly \nsought vacatur to meet the clarified standards the cir-\ncuit issued on appeal. Discovery has not even com-\nmenced\u2014this case is in its infancy, and Plaintiffs \nshould have the opportunity to have their case adjudi-\ncated on the merits. \nARGUMENT  \nI. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s Analysis Is Consistent \nwith Post-Judgment Amendment Jurispru-\ndence Nationally. \nBLOM asserts that the summary order below \n\u201cabandons the \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 standard \nin favor of a nebulous \u2018balanc[ing]\u2019 inquiry that pits \nRule 60(b)(6)\u2019s protection of \u2018finality\u2019 against \u2018Rule \n15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policies.\u2019\u201d Pet.Br.25 (quot-\ning Pet.App.8). This is inaccurate.  \nFirst, as Respondent acknowledges, the decision \nbelow is a non-precedential summary order which \nmerely \u201c[r]el[ies] on a series of Second Circuit prece-\ndents.\u201d Pet.Br.20. In fact, the order only cites three de-\ncisions on post-judgment amendment\u2014Mandala and \nMetzler from the Second Circuit, and Foman v. Davis, \n371 U.S. 178 (1962), from this Court.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n25 \n \nSecond, these decisions are not erroneous and cer-\ntainly do not \u201cjettison\u201d the extraordinary circum-\nstances standard, as BLOM claims. Pet.Br.14. Man-\ndala holds that \u201c[r]elief under Rule 60(b)(6) is reserved \nfor cases that present \u2018extraordinary circumstances.\u2019\u201d \n88 F.4th at 361 (quoting Liljeberg, 486 U.S. at 863). \nAnd in Metzler, the Second Circuit affirmed denial of \npost-judgment amendment because \u201cthe plaintiffs-ap-\npellants fail[ed] to identify any \u2018extraordinary circum-\nstances\u2019 that would \u2018justify[] relief\u2019 under Rule \n60(b)(6).\u201d 970 F.3d at 147. \nAs explained below, the \u201cextraordinary circum-\nstances\u201d here are clear. This case is, as Judge Wesley \nput it, \u201cunusual,\u201d \u201cquirky,\u201d and \u201ccurious,\u201d appearing to \ndeny Plaintiffs even a single meaningful opportunity \nto amend. The Second Circuit therefore directed the \ndistrict court to reconsider its denial of vacatur given \nthe standards in Mandala and Metzler. As this re-\nmand reflected, Rule 60(b)(6) motions inherently re-\nquire \u201ccase-by-case inquiry,\u201d Stokes v. Williams, 475 \nF.3d 732, 736 (6th Cir. 2007)). Indeed, even if this \nCourt wanted to revisit its jurisprudence on Rule \n60(b), it is difficult to imagine it being able to fashion \nany generally applicable standard based on the \u201cunu-\nsual\u201d procedural history of this case. \nA. Rule 60(b)(6) Jurisprudence Balances Fi-\nnality and the Preference for Deciding \nCases on Their Merits. \nMandala and Metzler both apply the balancing test \narticulated in Williams v. Citigroup: \u201cpostjudgment \nmotions for leave to replead must be evaluated with \ndue regard to both the value of finality and the policies \nembodied in Rule 15.\u201d 659 F.3d at 213. Finality thus \nremains the starting point for applying Rule 60(b)(6) \nin the Second Circuit: \u201c[t]he standards we have \n\n \n \n \n \n \n26 \n \ndeveloped for evaluating postjudgment motions gener-\nally place significant emphasis on the \u2018value of finality \nand repose.\u2019\u201d Id. (citation omitted). The circuit notes \nthat \u2018\u201c[t]o hold otherwise would enable the liberal \namendment policy of Rule 15(a) to be employed in a \nway that is contrary to the philosophy favoring finality \nof judgments and the expeditious termination of liti-\ngation.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Nat\u2019l Petrochemical Co. v. M/T \nStolt Sheaf, 930 F.2d 240, 245 (2d Cir. 1991)). \nFinality is then balanced with Rule 15(a)\u2019s prefer-\nence for resolving cases on their merits, which the Wil-\nliams panel sourced from this Court\u2019s \u201c[p]articularly \ninstructive\u201d Foman decision. 695 F.3d at 213. Foman \nheld that the district court abused its discretion in \ndenying a motion to vacate the judgment in order to \namend the complaint:  \nRule 15(a) declares that leave to amend \u201cshall \nbe freely given when justice so requires\u201d; this \nmandate is to be heeded. See generally, 3 \nMoore, Federal Practice (2d ed. 1948), paras. \n15.08, 15.10. If the underlying facts or circum-\nstances relied upon by a plaintiff may be a \nproper subject of relief, he ought to be afforded \nan opportunity to test his claim on the mer-\nits. In the absence of any apparent or declared \nreason \u2014 such as undue delay, bad faith or di-\nlatory motive on the part of the movant, re-\npeated failure to cure deficiencies by amend-\nments previously allowed, undue prejudice to \nthe opposing party by virtue of allowance of the \namendment, futility of amendment, etc. \u2014 the \nleave sought should, as the rules require, be \n\u201cfreely given.\u201d Of course, the grant or denial of \nan opportunity to amend is within the discre-\ntion of the District Court, but outright refusal to \n\n \n \n \n \n \n27 \n \ngrant the leave without any justifying reason \nappearing for the denial is not an exercise of dis-\ncretion; it is merely abuse of that discretion and \ninconsistent with the spirit of the Federal \nRules. \n371 U.S. at 182.3 See, e.g., United States v. Vorachek, \n563 F.2d 884, 887 (8th Cir. 1977) (vacatur necessary \ngiven Foman and Rule 15(a)).  \nThis Court has always balanced the finality of judg-\nments with the preference for giving plaintiffs \u201can op-\nportunity to test their claims on the merits.\u201d For ex-\nample, this Court \u201cbalance[d] the interests of the de-\nfendant protected by the statute of limitations with \nthe preference expressed in the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure in general, and Rule 15 in particular, for re-\nsolving disputes on their merits.\u201d Krupski, 560 U.S. at \n550. A statute of limitations embodies the value of fi-\nnality and repose, see, e.g., Lozano v. Alvarez, 572 U.S. \n1, 14 (2014), just as, in the Second Circuit, \u201cpostjudg-\nment motions generally place significant emphasis on \n \n3  \nBLOM argues that the circuit erred in relying on Foman \nbecause the vacatur motion in that case was treated as coming \nunder Rule 59(e), not Rule 60(b), and the two rules \u201cdiffer in ma-\nterial ways and impose different standards for relief by their own \nterms.\u201d Pet.Br.18, 34-35. As explained infra 31-32, any such dis-\ntinction does not help BLOM\u2014but it was also completely irrele-\nvant to this Court\u2019s analysis in Foman. The First Circuit had de-\ncided to treat the motion as \u201cfiled pursuant to Rule 59(e), rather \nthan under Rule 60(b)\u201d to resolve an unrelated procedural issue \ninvolving two notices of appeal. Foman v. Davis, 292 F.2d 85, 87 \n(1st Cir. 1961). This Court then noted that the \u201cCourt of Appeals\u2019 \ntreatment of the motion to vacate as one under Rule 59(e) was \npermissible, at least as an original matter, and we will accept \nthat characterization here.\u201d 371 U.S. at 181. It never suggested \nthat the \u201ccharacterization\u201d impacted its review or the vacatur \nstandards it applied.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n28 \n \nthe \u2018value of finality and repose,\u2019\u201d Williams, 659 F.3d \nat 213 (internal citation omitted).  \nThis Court has also always understood Rule 60(b) \nas accommodating that preference, rejecting argu-\nments that overemphasize finality at its expense. For \nexample: \u201c[T]he State reminds us of the importance of \npreserving the finality of judgments. But the \u2018whole \npurpose\u2019 of Rule 60(b) \u2018is to make an exception to final-\nity.\u2019\u201d Buck, 580 U.S. at 126 (citations omitted). BLOM \nrelies heavily on this Court\u2019s analysis of finality in \nGonzalez v. Crosby but omits its conclusion: \u201c[W]e give \nlittle weight to respondent\u2019s appeal to the virtues of \nfinality. That policy consideration, standing alone, is \nunpersuasive in the interpretation of a provision \nwhose whole purpose is to make an exception to final-\nity.\u201d 545 U.S. 524, 529 (2005). Likewise, BLOM quotes \nthis Court\u2019s admonition in United States v. Denedo \nthat \u201cjudgment finality is not to be lightly cast aside,\u201d \nPet.Br.27, but again leaves out the Court\u2019s conclusion: \n\u201cthe finality rule is not so inflexible that it trumps each \nand every competing consideration.\u201d 556 U.S. 904, 916 \n(2009). A \u201cjudgment\u201d based on the wrong reasons, due \nlargely to what the circuit itself concedes to have been \nits own \u201cambigu[ous]\u201d precedent, Pet.App.40 n.11, is \nto be \u201ccast aside\u201d in order to permit disposition on the \nmerits.  \nLike this Court, the Second Circuit rejects \u201ca stand-\nard that overemphasize[s] considerations of finality at \nthe expense of the liberal amendment policy embodied \nin the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\u201d Williams, 659 \nF.3d at 210. And like this Court, the Second Circuit \nholds that \u201cRule 60(b) relief is designed to afford par-\nties an opportunity to resolve a dispute on its merits.\u201d \nNemaizer v. Baker, 793 F.2d 58, 63 (2d Cir. 1986) (cit-\ning 7 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, \u00b6 60.19, at 156 (2d ed. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n29 \n \n1983)). That is, the policies underlying Rules 60(b) and \n15(a) work \u201cin tandem,\u201d as the Second Circuit ex-\nplained below. Pet.App.7. \nThe circuit courts have also consistently recognized \nthis balance inherent in Rule 60(b)(6). The rule\u2019s \u201c[ex-\ntraordinary circumstances] requirement exists in or-\nder to balance the broad language of Rule 60(b)(6), \nwhich allows courts to set aside judgments for \u2018any\u2019 \nreason justifying relief, with the interest in the finality \nof judgments.\u201d Budget Blinds, 536 F.3d at 255. The \nNinth Circuit sourced this principle to Gonzalez:  \nAs the Sixth Circuit rightly held when applying \nGonzalez, \u201cthe decision to grant Rule 60(b)(6) \nrelief is a case-by-case inquiry that requires the \ntrial court to intensively balance numerous fac-\ntors, including the competing policies of the fi-\nnality of judgments and the incessant command \nof the court\u2019s conscience that justice be done in \nlight of all the facts.\u201d  \nPhelps v. Alameida, 569 F.3d 1120, 1133 (9th Cir. \n2009) (quoting Stokes, 475 F.3d at 736). See also In re \nSpansion, Inc., 507 F. App\u2019x 125, 128 (3d Cir. 2012) \n(\u201cThe rule seeks \u2018to strike a proper balance between \nthe conflicting principles that litigation must be \nbrought to an end and that justice must be done.\u2019\u201d) (ci-\ntation omitted); Blue Diamond Coal Co. v. Trs. of the \nUMWA Combined Benefit Fund, 249 F.3d 519, 529 \n(6th Cir. 2001) (same); People for the Ethical Treat-\nment of Animals v. United States HHS, 901 F.3d 343, \n354-55 (D.C.

Miller & M.K. \nKane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2851 (2d ed. \n1995) (same). \nThe Eighth Circuit has held that district courts re-\nviewing post-judgment motions to amend under Rule \n59(e) or Rule 60(b) \u2018\u201cmay not ignore the Rule 15(a)(2) \nconsiderations that favor affording parties an oppor-\ntunity to test their claims on the merits . . . .\u2019\u201d Mask of \nKa-Nefer-Nefer, 752 F.3d at 743 (quoting United \nStates ex rel. Roop v. Hypoguard USA, Inc., 559 F.3d \n818, 823-24 (8th Cir. 2009)). Indeed, Moore\u2019s Federal \nPractice specifically notes that \u201c[t]he hybrid approach \nof the Second and Eighth Circuits strikes the correct \nbalance: it protects the strong interest in finality of \njudgments and the expeditious termination of litiga-\ntion, while allowing postjudgment amendment of \npleadings in a particular case if justice requires.\u201d 12 \nMoore\u2019s Federal Practice - Civil \u00a7 59.30. For that prop-\nosition, Moore\u2019s relies on two Rule 60(b)(6) cases\u2014Wil-\nliams and Mask of Ka-Nefer-Nefer. Id., \u00a7 59.30 n.9.1.3, \nn.9.1.4. \nThe Seventh Circuit gives even greater weight to \nRule 15 interests when the district court has entered \njudgment at the same time it dismisses a complaint: \nBecause Rules 59(e) and 60(b) are reserved for \nextraordinary cases, the Girl Scouts urge us to \napply a more demanding standard to post-judg-\nment motions to amend than we do to motions \nto amend filed prior to the entry of judgment. \n \n4  \nThe same is true for Rule 59(e), in which \u201c[t]he court must \nstrike the proper balance between two competing imperatives: (1) \nfinality, and (2) the need to render just decisions on the basis of \nall the facts.\u201d Edward H. Bohlin Co. v.

Davis, 590 U.S. 504 \n(2020), but that case deals with what types of vacatur motions \ncount as a successive habeas application. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n32 \n \nheld that \u201cto obtain relief from a final judgment under \nRule 60(b), one of the six grounds enumerated must be \nsatisfied,\u201d including finding \u201cextraordinary circum-\nstances\u201d under Rule 60(b)(6). 97 F.4th at 178. The \nplaintiff failed to show \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d \nthere because she had already amended twice, and her \namendment \u201cefforts were pursued in bad faith.\u201d Id. at \n170. The extraordinary circumstances requirement is \nthe same in Metzler and Mandala (and in Runnion, \nwhich did find \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d).  \nIn sum, BLOM\u2019s claim that \u201cevery one of [the Sec-\nond Circuit\u2019s] sister Circuits\u201d disagrees with it is \nsimply wrong. Pet.Br.25. A number of BLOM\u2019s own \ncases recognize the need to balance competing policies \nin Rule 60(b). For example, in Leisure Caviar, LLC v. \nUnited States Fish & Wildlife Service, the Sixth Cir-\ncuit explained that while amendment should be \u201cfreely \nallowed,\u201d \u201cwhen a Rule 15 motion comes after a judg-\nment against the plaintiff,\u201d courts \u201cmust \u2018consider[] \nthe competing interest of protecting the finality of \njudgments\u201d; that is, \u201c[i]nstead of meeting only the \nmodest requirements of Rule 15, the claimant must \nmeet the requirements for reopening a case estab-\nlished by Rules 59 or 60.\u201d 616 F.3d 612, 615-16 (6th \nCir. 2010) (citations omitted) (emphases added). Like \nin Phelps, Leisure Caviar directs courts to balance the \n\u201ccompeting\u201d policies of Rule 15 and Rule 60.  \nAnd in Nation v. DOI, the Ninth Circuit explained \nthat \u201c[a]fter judgment . . . \u2018our policy of promoting the \nfinality of judgments\u2019 somewhat displaces Rule 15\u2019s \nopenhandedness,\u201d given Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s predicate of \nextraordinary circumstances. 876 F.3d 1144, 1173 (9th \nCir. 2017) (citation omitted) (emphasis added). That \ncase affirmed denial of post-judgment leave to amend \nbecause the plaintiff had already twice amended and \n\n \n \n \n \n \n33 \n \nfailed to identify how yet another amendment could \ncure its standing problem.  \nMost of BLOM\u2019s remaining cases simply note that \na judgment must be appealed or vacated before a com-\nplaint is amended or that Rule 15(a) does not alone \nprovide the analytical basis for vacatur\u2014but none dis-\npute that the Rule 15 principles could inform the ex-\nceptional circumstances analysis. See Rosenzweig, 332 \nF.3d at 864 (explaining that post-judgment amend-\nment requires appeal or vacatur); In re Ferro Corp. \nDerivative Litig., 511 F.3d 611, 624 (6th Cir. 2008) \n(same); Helm v. Resolution Tr. Corp., 84 F.3d 874, 879 \n(7th Cir. 1996) (same); Bldg. Indus. Ass\u2019n v. Norton, \n247 F.3d 1241, 1245 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (same); Boyd v. \nSecretary, 114 F.4th 1232, 1237 (11th Cir. 2024) \n(same). Indeed, in a case BLOM cites for the proposi-\ntion that \u201cthere is no pending complaint to amend\u201d \nonce \u201cthe action has been dismissed\u201d with prejudice, \nthe opinion noted that courts still apply \u201cRule 15 \nstandards\u201d to such vacatur motions. Calvary Christian \nCenter v. City of Fredericksburg, 710 F.3d 536, 540 \n(4th Cir. 2013). \nTo the extent that any of BLOM\u2019s cases can be read \nto suggest that Rule 15(a)\u2019s preference for determining \ncases on their merits plays no role in motions for post-\njudgment amendment, they are out of step with the \nother circuits. BLOM quotes Garrett v. Wexford \nHealth as holding that under Rule 60(b), \u201c[t]he permis-\nsive policy favoring amendment under Rule 15 was \nsimply not relevant.\u201d 938 F.3d 69, 86 (3d Cir. 2019). \nBut that case cited and relied on Leisure Caviar, 616 \nF.3d at 615-16, which requires courts to weigh the \n\u201ccompeting interests\u201d of Rules 15 and 60. The starker \nlanguage in Garrett was understandable as the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n34 \n \nplaintiff had already amended his complaint four \ntimes, clearly exhausting the policy of liberal amend-\nment.  \nUnsurprisingly, BLOM has selected cases where \nplaintiffs have thoroughly exhausted any chance to \namend. As noted above, Daulatzai involved a motion \nto file a fourth complaint, \u201cpursued in bad faith.\u201d 97 \nF.4th at 170. In James v. Watt, 716 F.2d 71, 77 (1st \nCir. 1983), the delay in amendment was \u201cstrategic.\u201d In \nIn re Ferro, the plaintiff did not have an actual amend-\nment in mind and needed discovery. 511 F.3d at 624. \nSee also Helm, 84 F.3d at 879 (\u201cinexcusable attorney \nnegligence\u201d); UMB Bank, N.A. v. Guerin, 89 F.4th \n1047, 1057-58 (8th Cir. 2024) (proposed second \namended complaint \u201crepeats . . . scandalous, logically \nirrelevant material\u201d and was futile) (internal quota-\ntion marks and citations omitted); Nation, 876 F.3d at \n1174 (plaintiff \u201camended its complaint twice before\u201d \ndismissal).  \nB. Rule 60(b)\u2019s Balancing Means Ensuring \nParties Have a Meaningful Opportunity \nto Amend Pleadings at Least Once, \nWhich Courts Broadly Support. \nIn the Second Circuit, the practical effect of the bal-\nancing inquiry for post-judgment motions to amend is \nfar less dramatic than BLOM suggests: \u201cIn the post-\njudgment context, we have indeed given \u2018due regard\u2019 \nto \u2018the liberal spirit of Rule 15\u2019 by ensuring plaintiffs \nat least one opportunity to replead.\u201d Metzler, 970 F.3d \nat 146 (quoting Williams, 659 F.3d at 213-14). See also \nMandala, 88 F.4th at 362 (same). If the plaintiff has \nhad a meaningful chance to amend, dismissal is no \nlonger extraordinary:  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n35 \n \nIn most if not all Second Circuit cases denying \npost-judgment leave to replead, the plaintiff \nhad already taken at least one shot at amend-\nment. This makes sense: when a plaintiff al-\nready had multiple chances to state a claim, \nthere is little risk of manifest injustice in deny-\ning yet another go. \nId. (citations omitted). \nBut a chance to state a claim is only meaningful if \nthe claimant has been fairly instructed in the correct \nlegal standard, either by a ruling of the district court \nor by clear precedent. Such a ruling identifies actual \nand remediable defects in the complaint, if any. See, \ne.g., United States ex rel. Customs Fraud Investiga-\ntions, LLC v. Victaulic Co., 839 F.3d 242, 250 (3d Cir. \n2016) (observing that without a ruling, \u201ca plaintiff is \nunlikely to know whether his complaint is actually de-\nficient\u2014and in need of revision\u201d); Tate v. SCR Med. \nTransp., 809 F.3d 343, 346 (7th Cir. 2015) (\u201cthe court \nshould grant leave to amend after dismissal of the first \ncomplaint \u2018unless it is certain from the face of the com-\nplaint that any amendment would be futile or other-\nwise unwarranted\u2019\u201d) (citation omitted); United States \nex rel. Lee v. Corinthian Colls., 655 F.3d 984, 998 (9th \nCir. 2011) (\u201c[plaintiffs] should have at least one oppor-\ntunity to add any such facts to the Complaint\u201d); Fire-\nstone v. Firestone, 76 F.3d 1205, 1208 (D.C. Cir. 1996) \n(similar). The Second Circuit noted that it is an \u201cim-\npropriety\u201d to deny amendment \u201cwithout the benefit of \na ruling,\u201d as that presents plaintiffs with a \u201cHobson\u2019s \nchoice: agree to cure deficiencies not yet fully briefed \nand decided or forfeit the opportunity to replead.\u201d Lo-\nreley Fin. (Jersey) No. 3 Ltd. v. Wells Fargo Sec., LLC, \n797 F.3d 160, 190 (2d Cir. 2015). \n\n \n \n \n \n \n36 \n \nOrdinarily, entering judgment dismissing a case \nwithout the opportunity to amend is an abuse of dis-\ncretion. See supra 30-31 (quoting Runnion, 786 F.3d at \n521). See also Jack v. Evonik Corp., 79 F.4th 547, 565 \n(5th Cir. 2023) (\u201cPlaintiffs should usually be able to \namend at least once, because \u2018fairness requires\u2019 it.\u201d) \n(citation omitted). In such case, \u201c[t]he district court left \nthe plaintiff with little recourse but to file a motion \nunder Rules 59(e) and 60(b) . . . .\u201d Foster v. DeLuca, \n545 F.3d 582, 584 (7th Cir. 2008).  \nIn fact, Plaintiffs\u2019 motion here would have come un-\nder Rule 59(e), which BLOM\u2019s cases suggest are eval-\nuated under Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal standards only, see \nsupra 31-32\u2014if not for the necessity of appealing the \ndistrict court\u2019s erroneous and essentially impossible \npleading standards first. See Mask of Ka-Nefer-Nefer, \n752 F.3d at 743 (explaining that appealing is \u201cthe \nproper recourse\u201d where a dismissal decision is wrong). \nAs the Seventh Circuit explained, \u201ca plaintiff who re-\nceives a Rule 12(b)(6) motion and who has good reason \nto think the complaint is sufficient may also choose to \nstand on the complaint and insist on a decision with-\nout losing the benefit of the well-established liberal \nstandard for amendment with leave of court under \nRule 15(a)(2).\u201d Runnion, 786 F.3d at 523. \nOf course, that entailed a risk\u2014Plaintiffs could \nhave been wrong on appeal. If the Second Circuit had \naffirmed the district court\u2019s reasoning (and not just \noutcome), that would not be an \u201cexceptional circum-\nstance\u201d\u2014that happens routinely and when it does, a \nplaintiff may have made a \u201cfree, calculated, [and] de-\nliberate choice\u201d not to take advantage of any prior op-\nportunities to amend. The circuit\u2019s affirmance on other \ngrounds here was thus fortuitous for BLOM\u2014but that \n\n \n \n \n \n \n37 \n \ndoes not justify elevating finality over the interests of \njustice. \nThis is why BLOM is compelled to argue that the \nSecond Circuit really affirmed dismissal of the case on \nthe same \u201cgrounds\u201d the district court used. Pet.Br.40. \nBut the district court acknowledged its dismissal was \nonly affirmed \u201con other grounds.\u201d Pet.App.10. The Sec-\nond Circuit\u2019s ground for affirmance involved one of the \nsame elements (knowledge), but for a fundamentally \ndifferent reason: the (original and still only) complaint \nrelied too much on \u201cpublicly available evidence\u201d rather \nthan \u201cpublic sources\u201d of information identifying \nBLOM\u2019s customers as Hamas-affiliated entities, and \nits allegation of the latter was too \u201climited.\u201d \nPet.App.51. \nThat the pleading standard was clarified on appeal \nis grounds to permit amendment, not deny it. For ex-\nample, in Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., \nthis Court explained that \u201c[w]hile we reject the Sev-\nenth Circuit\u2019s approach . . . we do not decide whether, \nunder the standard we have described . . . the Share-\nholders\u2019 allegations\u201d are sufficient. Because the lower \ncourts lacked \u201cthe opportunity to consider the matter \nin light of the prescriptions we announce today,\u201d the \nCourt vacated judgment \u201cso that the case may be reex-\namined in accord with our construction . . . .\u201d 551 U.S. \n308, 329 (2007). And after clarifying the Rule 8 plead-\ning standard in Ashcroft v. Iqbal, this Court ordered \nthat \u201c[t]he Court of Appeals should decide in the first \ninstance whether to remand to the District Court so \nthat respondent can seek leave to amend his deficient \ncomplaint.\u201d 556 U.S. 662, 687 (2009). See also Johnson \nv. City of Shelby, 574 U.S. 10, 12 (2014) (reversing dis-\nmissal with instructions to permit amendment if nec-\nessary). See also Marranzano v. Riggs Nat\u2019l Bank, 184 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n38 \n \nF.2d 349, 351 (D.C. Cir. 1950) (where a decision is \u201caf-\nfirmed\u201d but \u201cbased on an incorrect ground,\u201d the \u201cends \nof justice\u201d require \u201can opportunity to amend [the] com-\nplaint\u201d); Oil, Chem. & Atomic Workers Int\u2019l Union v. \nDelta Ref. Co., 277 F.2d 694, 697 (6th Cir. 1960) \n(where \u201cthe views which we have expressed give the \ncase a somewhat different aspect than it had under the \ntrial court\u2019s ruling,\u201d amendment is appropriate).  \nAfter the Second Circuit affirmed dismissal on \nother grounds in Honickman II, it left Plaintiffs the \nchoice of whether to move for post-judgment leave to \namend, if they thought they had the allegations to do \nso. But as is clear from the subsequent summary order \nbelow remanding the case for further consideration, \nthat affirmance was not intended to preclude Plain-\ntiffs from seeking an opportunity to amend.  \nII. \nThe Second Circuit Did Not Find Waiver, \nand Thus Did Not Alter the Vacatur Stand-\nard in Its Summary Order \nBLOM\u2019s argument hangs on the straw man that \nthe Second Circuit agreed that Plaintiffs \u201cconsistently \nand consciously rejected numerous invitations and op-\nportunities to amend,\u201d but nevertheless \u201cdirected dis-\ntrict courts to override and rescue parties from their \n\u2018free, calculated, [and] deliberate choices.\u2019\u201d Pet.Br.28-\n29 (citations omitted). Although BLOM pressed this \nargument to the circuit below, see BLOM Brief, No. 22-\n1039, Dkt. No. 42, at 1-2, 41-43, the circuit did not find \nany such waiver. To the contrary, it found that the dis-\ntrict court applied a \u201cwrong standard\u201d that was un-\nmeetable. As Judge Wesley asked BLOM\u2019s counsel \nduring the oral argument below, \u201cWhat are [Plaintiffs] \nsupposed to do? They know they can\u2019t amend [to] \n. . . meet\u201d the standard BLOM urged and the district \ncourt adopted. Notably, BLOM does not challenge the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n39 \n \nSecond Circuit\u2019s findings as to waiver in its question \npresented here. \nNevertheless, BLOM attempts to muster evidence \nof occasions when Plaintiffs forfeited opportunities to \namend. The first two \u201copportunities\u201d were the district \ncourt\u2019s invitations to amend before issuing its dismis-\nsal decision. But these opportunities were not mean-\ningful because they offered only to amend in conform-\nity with the incorrect legal standards BLOM urged, \ngiving Plaintiffs no notice of defects under the correct \nlegal standard. See, e.g., Bryant v. Dupree, 252 F.3d \n1161, 1164 (11th Cir. 2001) (\u201cit cannot be said that the \nplaintiffs failed to correct defects of which they had no-\ntice\u201d) (emphasis added). There is no forfeiture where \n\u201cDefendants did not [identify] below\u201d and \u201cthe district \ncourt itself did not rely on the deficiencies we have \nidentified in dismissing\u201d a plaintiff\u2019s claims\u2014espe-\ncially where \u201cthe district court\u2019s reasoning meant that \nno such amendments would remedy the defects that \nthe district court perceived.\u201d Charles Schwab Corp. v. \nBank of Am. Corp., 883 F.3d 68, 89-90 (2d Cir. 2018).  \nAgain, even the district court here acknowledged \nthat its dismissal decision was only affirmed \u201con other \ngrounds.\u201d Pet.App.10. BLOM notes that Plaintiffs \ncould have added some useful additional allegations in \ntheir proposed amended complaint before appealing, \nbut it would have been futile to do so given that Plain-\ntiffs would still have failed to meet each of the district \ncourt\u2019s (erroneous) standards.  \nIndeed, if declining these pre-judgment \u201copportuni-\nties\u201d to amend constituted waiver, litigants would be \ncompelled to file serial (futile) amendments and re-\nbrief Rule 12(b) motions simply to preserve their \nrights to amend post-appeal, which would hardly im-\nprove the efficiency of the lower federal courts or lead \n\n \n \n \n \n \n40 \n \nto more equitable outcomes. Likewise, a rule that dis-\nincentives bringing valid cases \u201cwhere the law [i]s re-\nally recasting itself\u201d in the circuit courts, as Judge \nWesley observed it was here, Oral Arg. at 13:23-38, \ndoes not promote the interests of justice. \nBLOM faults Plaintiffs for not moving for vacatur-\nfor-amendment instead of appealing, or not appealing \nthe with-prejudice nature of the dismissal. Pet.Br.11. \nPlaintiffs did not seek vacatur before appealing be-\ncause there is \u201cno reason\u201d to \u201cfile a post-judgment mo-\ntion seeking leave to amend\u201d where \u201cthe district \ncourt\u2019s reasoning meant that no such amendments \nwould remedy the defects that the district court per-\nceived.\u201d Charles Schwab, 883 F.3d at 90. Again, \u201cthe \nproper recourse when [a party] disagreed with the dis-\ntrict court\u2019s interpretation of the . . . statute was a di-\nrect appeal, not a Rule 60(b) motion.\u201d Mask of Ka-\nNefer-Nefer, 752 F.3d at 743. And Plaintiffs did not \nappeal the \u201cwith-prejudice\u201d component of the dismis-\nsal decision because leave to amend would not have \naltered the result without the circuit first correcting \nthe district court\u2019s legal errors.  \nFinally, BLOM also faults Plaintiffs for not asking \nthe circuit court for leave to amend in their post-argu-\nment supplemental brief in Honickman II. Pet.Br.11. \nThough asking the circuit for leave to amend is per-\nmissible, in the Second Circuit, post-judgment leave to \namend is generally a decision for the district court to \nmake \u201cin the first instance.\u201d Iqbal v. Ashcroft, 574 F.3d \n820, 822 (2d Cir. 2009).6 The circuit court\u2019s job is to \n \n6  \nBLOM also faults Plaintiffs for \u201cnot seek[ing] rehearing,\u201d \nPet.Br.12, but in the Mandala dissent BLOM relies on, Judge Sul-\nlivan criticized precisely that: \u201c[r]ather than seek vacatur and \nleave to amend\u201d after the first appeal, \u201cPlaintiffs instead opted to \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n41 \n \nassess the district court\u2019s ruling\u2014it goes without say-\ning that if a viable amendment is necessary, plaintiffs \nwill want to make it. The summary order demon-\nstrates that the circuit court did not find a need for \nPlaintiffs to have requested leave to amend from the \nfirst panel (Judge Wesley was on both unanimous pan-\nels). \nIII. \nThe Balancing Inquiry Does Not Conflict \nwith the Text of Any of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure. \nBLOM argues that the Second Circuit\u2019s precedent \nconflicts with the plain text of Rule 15(a) and Rule \n60(b). To do so, it erroneously construes the Second \nCircuit\u2019s basis for remand as \u201callow[ing] plaintiffs to \nleapfrog over \u2018Rule 60(b)\u2019s finality gauntlet\u2019 to the \nsanctuary of \u2018Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal repleading policy.\u2019\u201d \nPet.Br.30. Again, the Second Circuit directs district \ncourts to balance Rule 60(b)\u2019s finality and Rule 15(a)\u2019s \nliberality \u201cin tandem,\u201d Pet.App.7; it does not permit \n\u201cleapfrogging.\u201d See Meltzer, 970 F.3d at 146 (finding \nthe \u201cargument that the [post-judgment] motion is gov-\nerned solely by the legal standard applicable to Rule \n15(a)(2) motions . . . without merit.\u201d). \nTo establish a textual conflict, BLOM argues that \nRule 15(a) \u201capplies only to \u2018Amendments Before \nTrial,\u2019\u201d and \u201c[i]t is in that setting . . . that the Rules \nencourage courts to \u2018freely give leave\u2019 to amend.\u201d \nPet.Br.30. Thus, BLOM suggests, Rule 15\u2019s preference \n \nfile a petition for rehearing en banc\u2014a strategic choice that \nplainly undermines any argument that some aspect of the district \ncourt\u2019s order was an \u2018extraordinary circumstance\u2019 preventing \nPlaintiffs from pursuing their claims.\u201d 88 F.4th at 368. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n42 \n \nfor deciding cases on their merits is entirely extin-\nguished at judgment.  \nBut Rule 15 contemplates two stages of amend-\nment\u2014before trial and during or after trial. Both in-\nvolve \u201cfreely\u201d giving leave to amend, under certain cir-\ncumstances which depend on trial, not judgment. See \nRule 15(a)(2), Rule 15(b)(1). The rule has no higher \nstandard. \nIndeed, \n\u201c\u2018[a]mendments \nunder \n[Rule \n15(a)(2)] may be made at any stage of the litigation.\u2019 \nGranting leave to amend after summary judgment is \nthus allowed at the discretion of the trial court.\u201d Ngu-\nyen v. United States, 792 F.2d 1500, 1502 (9th Cir. \n1986) (quoting 6 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Prac-\ntice and Procedure \u00a7 1484 (1971)). See also Dussouy v. \nGulf Coast Inv. Corp., 660 F.2d 594, 598 (5th Cir. \n1981) (applying Rule 15 and noting that \u201c[i]nstances \nabound in which appellate courts on review have re-\nquired that leave to amend be granted after dismissal \nor entry of judgment\u201d). \nObviously, this case was not dismissed after trial\u2014\nit was dismissed following an initial Rule 12(b)(6) mo-\ntion, before Plaintiffs had the opportunity to try to \ncure any actual defects in their complaint. That is pre-\ncisely the context that Rule 15(a) squarely addresses. \nEntering judgment does not eliminate Rule 15(a)\u2019s \npreference for \u201cresolving disputes on their merits.\u201d \nKrupski, 560 U.S. at 550. \nBLOM argues that Rule 15(a) \u201cdoes not provide a \nmechanism for amending pleadings after dismissal,\u201d \nPet.Br.30, but that is likewise irrelevant. To the extent \nRule 60(b)(6) provides the \u201cmechanism,\u201d it is an \u201cex-\nception to finality\u201d for \u201cany reason that justifies relief.\u201d \nGranting leave to amend \u201cwhen justice so requires,\u201d as \nRule 15(a) commands, presumably informs the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n43 \n \nreasons that \u201cjustify relief\u201d under Rule 60(b)(6)\u2014in-\ncluding providing an opportunity to amend at least \nonce.7  \nBLOM asserts that the Second Circuit\u2019s \u201cbalancing \ntest\u201d conflicts with the rest of Rule 60(b) because it \nwould permit plaintiffs to \u201cevade those explicit time \nlimitations in\u201d Rule 60(b)(1) (relief given mistake or \nexcusable neglect) and Rule 60(b)(2) (relief given new \nevidence). Pet.Br.31-33. But the Second Circuit has \nnever suggested that vacatur and amendment are per-\nmissible where a complaint failed due to counsel\u2019s mis-\ntake or where a plaintiff simply wants to present new \nevidence over a year after judgment. Instead, a district \ncourt\u2019s failure to give plaintiffs at least one meaningful \nopportunity to replead may constitute extraordinary \ncircumstances, and vacatur and amendment may be \nappropriate.  \nIn Mandala, the Second Circuit determined which \nprovision of Rule 60(b) applied before turning to the \npolicies and standards of either Rule 60(b) or Rule \n15(a): \u201cProper characterization of Plaintiffs\u2019 Rule 60(b) \nmotion is a threshold issue because, as previously ex-\nplained, [Rule 60(b)\u2019s] provisions are subject to differ-\nent filing limitations . . . .\u201d 88 F.4th at 359. The Second \nCircuit determined that Rule 60(b)(6) was the proper \nrule because \u201cinsufficient pleading is not categorically \na \u2018mistake,\u2019 and Plaintiffs\u2019 belief that their Complaint \nsatisfied the standards for pleading a disparate impact \nclaim was well-founded, even if ultimately erroneous.\u201d \nId. \n \n7  \nBLOM contends that this Court should read Rule 60(b) \nwith Rule 1, not Rule 15(a). Pet.Br.35-38. But Rule 1 does not \nnegate Rule 15\u2014to the extent Rule 1 provides any guidance here, \nit is its command to secure the \u201cjust\u201d outcome. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n44 \n \nNor does the decision below conflict with Rule \n60(b)(2), which only permits vacatur to introduce (1) \nnewly discovered evidence (2) within a year of judg-\nment. The Second Circuit does not permit post-judg-\nment amendments \u201cbased on previously omitted alle-\ngations,\u201d as BLOM asserts (or evidence discovered \nover a year after judgment). Pet.Br.33. In fact, Metzler \nrejected an attempt to circumvent Rule 60(b)(2)\u2019s \n\u201cnewly discovered evidence standard.\u201d 970 F.3d at 146. \nThat case still required a showing of extraordinary cir-\ncumstances under Rule 60(b)(6). BLOM points out \nthat movants might introduce allegations they could \nhave presented before, Pet.Br.33, but Rule 60(b) gives \nreasons for vacating a judgment\u2014it does not limit \nwhat a party can include in an amended pleading once \nvacatur and leave to amend are granted. \nTo be clear, BLOM no longer appears to contest \nthat Rule 60(b)(6) applies in this case. The district \ncourt itself found that Rule 60(b)(6) applied here, not-\ning that \u201cnone of [the other provisions] are applicable\u201d \nto Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for vacatur. Pet.App.12. BLOM \ndid nevertheless argue to the panel below that Rule \n60(b)(1) applied, but the circuit did not accept the ar-\ngument, assessing the case under Rule 60(b)(6). See \nPet.App.6-7. BLOM did not challenge the district \ncourt\u2019s or circuit court\u2019s application of Rule 60(b)(6) in \nits petition for certiorari or in their merits brief to this \nCourt. \nIV. \nExtraordinary Circumstances Are Present \nHere Because After Honickman II Clarified \nthe Previously \u201cAmbigu[ous]\u201d Legal Stand-\nards, Plaintiffs Were Denied Any Oppor-\ntunity to Meet Them. \nAs this Court has explained, \u201c[i]n determining \nwhether extraordinary circumstances are present \n\n \n \n \n \n \n45 \n \n[under Rule 60(b)(6)], a court may consider a wide \nrange of factors,\u201d including \u201c\u2018the risk of injustice to the \nparties\u2019 and \u2018the risk of undermining the public\u2019s con-\nfidence in the judicial process.\u2019\u201d Buck, 580 U.S. at 123 \n(quoting Liljeberg, 486 U.S. at 864). In Mandala, the \nSecond Circuit noted several factors in that case that \nestablished exceptional circumstances for purposes of \na motion for post-judgment amendment: \n[1] Plaintiffs have yet to be afforded a single op-\nportunity to amend their pleading; [2] the orig-\ninal dismissal of the Complaint was premised \non grounds subject to reasonable, actual, and \nvigorous debate; [3] Plaintiffs diligently prose-\ncuted their case at all times; and [4] Plaintiffs\u2019 \nproposed amendments address the sole plead-\ning deficiency identified by the district court.  \n88 F.4th at 365.  \nPlaintiffs meet all of these factors here. Denying \nPlaintiffs leave to amend risks injustice, as they may \nlose their only opportunity to have this case decided on \nthe merits, as the statute of limitations has run on \ntheir claims. See LeBlanc v. Cleveland, 248 F.3d 95, \n101 (2d Cir. 2001) (finding \u201c\u2018extraordinary circum-\nstances\u2019 under Rule 60(b)(6), because [plaintiff] would \nbe left without a remedy if the motion [for vacatur and \nleave to amend] were not granted\u201d). And where the \ncase is at its earliest stage, with no discovery con-\nducted, the prejudice to BLOM is limited solely to \nbriefing a new motion to dismiss against allegations \ntailored to meet the legal standards articulated by the \nSecond Circuit and this Court in Taamneh. The poten-\ntial burden of re-briefing a motion to dismiss is already \nbuilt into Rules 15(a)(1) and (2) and is not the kind of \nprejudice that the Rule considers. See, e.g., Patton v. \nGuyer, 443 F.2d 79, 86 (10th Cir. 1971) (\u201cThere is \n\n \n \n \n \n \n46 \n \ninvariably some practical prejudice resulting from an \namendment, but this is not the test for refusal of an \namendment. . . . The defendants were not prejudiced \nin terms of preparing their defense to the amend-\nment.\u201d). \nIndeed, courts have applied more liberal standards \nto motions for post-judgment amendment at early \nstages in the litigation. For example, the Fifth Circuit \nheld that \u201cthe Rule 15 standards apply when a party \nseeks to amend a judgment that has been entered \nbased on the pleadings,\u201d but doubted whether those \nstandards would apply \u201cafter trial.\u201d S. Constructors \nGrp. v. Dynalectric Co., 2 F.3d 606, 611 (5th Cir. 1993). \nSee also Duggins v. Steak \u2018n Shake, Inc., 195 F.3d 828, \n834 (6th Cir. 1999) (holding that amendment risks sig-\nnificant prejudice \u201cafter the close of discovery\u201d); Ru-\notolo v. City of N.Y., 514 F.3d 184, 187, 192 (2d Cir. \n2008) (similar).  \nPlaintiffs have also yet to be afforded a single \nmeaningful opportunity to amend their complaint; the \nbasis for the original dismissal of the complaint was \nnot merely open to \u201cvigorous debate,\u201d Mandala, 88 \nF.4th at 365, but entirely incorrect; Plaintiffs dili-\ngently prosecuted their case, appealing and moving for \nvacatur expeditiously; and Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed amend-\nments could address the actual defects in the com-\nplaint that the Second Circuit identified.  \nBLOM argues that no extraordinary circumstances \nare present here because (1) the district court\u2019s deci-\nsion was affirmed on the same grounds it provided; (2) \nPlaintiffs waived any \u201cright\u201d to an amendment be-\ncause they did not take the district court\u2019s invitations \nto amend; (3) even if the district court was wrong, a \nclarification or change in law is not an extraordinary \ncircumstance; and (4) Plaintiffs are at \u201cfault\u201d for \n\n \n \n \n \n \n47 \n \nfailing to amend or delaying doing so. Pet.Br.39-45. \nThe first two reasons are addressed above: the dismis-\nsal decision was premised on \u201cthe wrong legal stand-\nard,\u201d and the Second Circuit did not find that Plaintiffs \n\u201cwaived\u201d any meaningful opportunities to amend.  \nBLOM asserts that \u201cmere clarification of the law is \nnot extraordinary,\u201d as it \u201cis what appellate courts do \nday in and day out\u201d\u2014and, in fact, \u201cthis Court has held \nthat even an outright change in the law does not war-\nrant relief under Rule 60(b)(6).\u201d Pet.Br.19 (citing Gon-\nzalez, 545 U.S. at 537). But in Gonzalez, the change in \nlaw was made in another case after the case under re-\nview was decided, leading this Court to remark: \u201c[i]t is \nhardly extraordinary that subsequently, after peti-\ntioner\u2019s case was no longer pending, this Court arrived \nat a different interpretation.\u201d 545 U.S. at 537. Moreo-\nver, Mr. Gonzalez failed to show sufficient diligence \nbecause he did not \u201cseek review of the District Court\u2019s \ndecision\u201d on the issue relating to his vacatur motion. \nId.  \nHere the \u201cclarification\u201d came in the same case, as a \nresult of Plaintiffs\u2019 appeal. See Charles Schwab, 883 \nF.3d at 89-90. The Second Circuit \u201cacknowledge[d] the \ndistrict court\u2019s decision came before our opinion \nin Kaplan [II] clarified the import of our earlier \nJASTA aiding-and-abetting precedents which may \nhave generated some ambiguity as to the proper \nstandard.\u201d Pet.App.40 n.11. It is manifestly unfair to \nexpect Plaintiffs to fully understand a set of legal \nstandards that were still being \u201crecast[],\u201d Oral Arg. at \n13:23-38, when the district court could not. \nBLOM argues in the alternative that if the Second \nCircuit\u2019s clarification was \u201cin line with [Plaintiffs\u2019] \nown interpretation\u201d of JASTA, Plaintiffs \u201cnever \u2018ex-\nplain[ed] why they did not allege facts sufficient to \n\n \n \n \n \n \n48 \n \nsatisfy the standard for which they were advocating.\u2019\u201d \nPet.Br.41 (quoting Pet.App.17 n.5). But while Plain-\ntiffs were indeed broadly correct about JASTA\u2019s plead-\ning standards\u2014a fact that BLOM argues somehow \ncounts against them\u2014they could not anticipate the ev-\nidentiary distinction newly articulated by the Second \nCircuit between \u201cpublicly available evidence\u201d and \n\u201cpublic sources.\u201d \nIn fact, this Court has held that even a change in \nlaw in another case can constitute extraordinary cir-\ncumstances. See Kemp v. United States, 596 U.S. 528, \n540 (2022) (noting \u201cthe availability of Rule 60(b)(6) to \nreopen a judgment in extraordinary circumstances, in-\ncluding a change in controlling law\u201d and citing cases) \n(Sotomayor, J., concurring). For example, a change in \nlaw relating to the same incident justified reversing a \nthree-year-old denial of certiorari, because \u201cthe inter-\nest in finality of litigation must yield where the inter-\nests of justice would make unfair the strict application \nof our rules\u201d\u2014another recitation of the balancing test. \nGondeck v. Pan Am. World Airways, Inc., 382 U.S. 25, \n26-28 (1965). The Tenth Circuit also found such a \nchange in law in another case an \u201cextraordinary situ-\nation justifying Rule 60(b)(6) relief.\u201d Pierce v. Cook & \nCo., 518 F.2d 720, 723-24 (10th Cir. 1975) (en banc). \nThe interests of justice and demands of fairness are \neven more pronounced when the relevant \u201cchange in \nlaw\u201d occurs in the same case.  \nPetitioner\u2019s fourth waiver argument is wrong as \nwell: unlike BLOM\u2019s cases rejecting post-judgment \namendments that were strategically delayed like \nJames and Rozensweig, Plaintiffs here are not at any \n\u201cfault\u201d and did not engage in any \u201cgamesmanship.\u201d \nPet.Br.27, 33, 36, 44. They timely appealed the district \ncourt\u2019s incorrect dismissal decision and, once \u201c[a]rmed \n\n \n \n \n \n \n49 \n \nwith [the Second Circuit\u2019s] clarifications,\u201d promptly \nmoved for vacatur and leave to amend. There was no \n\u201cundue delay\u201d\u2014although \u201cdelay alone, regardless of \nits length is not enough to bar [amendment] if the \nother party is not prejudiced.\u201d Moore v. Paducah, 790 \nF.2d 557, 560 (6th Cir. 1986) (quoting 3 Moore\u2019s Fed-\neral Practice, para. 15.08 at 15.76). As explained \nabove, BLOM would not be unduly prejudiced by vaca-\ntur and amendment here. \nCONCLUSION \nBLOM quotes extensively from Ackermann v. \nUnited States to argue that \u201c\u2018[t]here must be an end to \nlitigation someday . . . .\u201d Pet.Br.1, 29 (quoting 340 U.S. \n193, 198 (1950)). BLOM\u2019s comparison of Ackermann to \nthis case is illustrative of its arguments generally. In \nAckermann, the petitioners sought vacatur four years \nafter judgments were entered following a trial, in or-\nder to bring an extremely late appeal. This case has \nnever even entered discovery. See Dubicz v. Common-\nwealth Edison Co., 377 F.3d 787, 793 n.1 (7th Cir. \n2004) (\u201cIt is important to emphasize that this litiga-\ntion has never progressed beyond the pleadings stage. \nThis is not the case where a plaintiff seeks to amend \nits complaint after the close of discovery or on the eve \nof trial.\u201d). Plaintiffs did file a timely and necessary ap-\npeal. Dismissal here is hardly what this Court in \nAckermann meant by \u201csomeday.\u201d \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be af-\nfirmed and the case should be remanded for further \nproceedings.  \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n50 \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \n \nMichael Radine \n Counsel of Record \nGary M.

Successfully executing this targeted search validates the importance of prioritizing influential amici over general searches. It refines the general strategy of 'check amicus briefs' into a more sophisticated, efficient workflow, confirming that identifying and analyzing the SG's position is a high-priority, high-yield step in the prediction process.\n\nJoint EIG (1.7): The combination of high task-specific predictive power and significant methodological insight makes this action extremely valuable.

This structured approach (Petitioner -> Respondent -> retry SG search) dramatically increases the probability that subsequent SEARCH actions will be successful and relevant, thus moving the agent much closer to a well-reasoned prediction.\n\nDesign EIG (0.7): This action demonstrates a highly effective and generalizable reasoning pattern for legal analysis: 1) attempt to find key evidence, 2) recognize failure/gaps, 3) step back to assess the information landscape, and 4) formulate a systematic plan to fill those gaps, starting with the most foundational documents (party briefs). This iterative process of self-correction and structured information gathering is a core component of a sophisticated legal reasoning agent, making this a valuable insight into effective design.\n\nThe joint value is high because this strategic re-orientation is essential for both making progress on the specific task and for demonstrating a robust, repeatable problem-solving methodology.",

As those precedents make clear, obtaining \nrelief from a final judgment under Rule 60(b)(6) \n\u201crequires a showing of \u2018extraordinary circumstances.\u2019\u201d  \nGonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524, 536 (2005).  And \nthose circumstances must demonstrate \u201cthat the \n[moving] party is faultless.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. \nBrunswick Assocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship, 507 U.S. 380, 393 \n(1993).  After all, \u201c[t]here must be an end to litigation \nsomeday, and free, calculated, deliberate choices are \nnot to be relieved from.\u201d  Ackermann v. United States, \n340 U.S. 193, 198 (1950). \nIt could hardly be otherwise.  Our adversarial \nsystem of civil justice could not function without a \nscrupulous regard for the conclusiveness of judgments \nprofessing to settle the parties\u2019 rights.  Courts have \nrecognized that fundamental precept since the \nFounding.  Consistent with that history and tradition, \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure afford district \ncourts the power to revisit a final judgment through \nRule 60(b) only in \u201ca limited set of circumstances.\u201d  \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. at 528.  And they strictly prohibit \na party from moving for such relief more than a year \nafter judgment if that party is even \u201cpartly to blame \nfor the delay.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs., 507 U.S. at 393; see \nFed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1), (c)(1).  \nFor decades, lower courts have faithfully applied \nthese well-settled principles of judgment finality.  And \nthey have uniformly rejected attempts by plaintiffs to \navoid Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent requirements by \n\n2 \n \nappealing to Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policy.  \nIndeed, the two inquiries are entirely separate.  Rule \n15(a) applies before trial and judgment, while Rule 60 \napplies after a final judgment.  Accordingly, \u201cif a \nplaintiff seeks to reopen a case under Rule 60(b) in \norder to file an amended complaint, she must satisfy \none of the Rule 60(b) grounds\u201d and have the judgment \nset aside \u201cbefore a court may consider her motion to \namend.\u201d  Daulatzai v. Maryland, 97 F.4th 166, 178 \n(4th Cir. 2024).  As the Fourth Circuit aptly put it \nearlier this year, adopting a contrary rule would have \nplaced it \u201calone in the Nation in collapsing the Rule \n60(b) standard with the standard for Rule 15(a).\u201d  Id. \nat 177. \nBut the decision below did just that\u2014in a case \nwhere Respondents repeatedly declined to amend \ntheir complaint in the normal course.  By rejecting the \nDistrict Court\u2019s multiple invitations to amend their \ncomplaint, Respondents deliberately chose to proceed \non that complaint as pled and take their chances on a \nmotion to dismiss.  The District Court eventually \ndismissed the complaint with prejudice, and the \nSecond Circuit affirmed the dismissal after full merits \nbriefing, oral argument, and supplemental briefing.  \nAt no time during those proceedings did Respondents \nseek leave to amend.   \nThen, more than 18 months after the dismissal \nwith prejudice\u2014and after that dismissal was affirmed \non appeal\u2014Respondents filed a Rule 60(b)(6) motion \nto vacate the judgment so they could restart the \nprocess and try again with an amended complaint.  \nThe District Court rejected that effort by properly \napplying Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent standard.  It \n\n3 \n \nemphasized that Respondents had \u201cnot demonstrated \nany extraordinary circumstances\u201d and had engaged in \na \u201cseries of deliberate choices not to cure the \ndeficiencies identified in their pleading by [Petitioner] \nand th[e] Court.\u201d  Pet.App.14, 19.  The District Court \ntherefore permissibly exercised its discretion to deny \nRespondents\u2019 motion. \nThe \nSecond \nCircuit \nnevertheless \nreversed.  \nApplying an atextual balancing test adopted by a split \npanel in Mandala v. NTT Data, Inc., 88 F.4th 353 (2d \nCir. 2023), the Second Circuit held that the District \nCourt abused its discretion by failing to \u201cgive \u2018due \nregard\u2019 to \u2018both the philosophy favoring finality of \njudgments . . . and the liberal amendment policy of \nRule 15(a).\u2019\u201d  Pet.App.7 (alteration in original) \n(quoting Mandala, 88 F.4th at 361).  In the Second \nCircuit\u2019s view, district courts are \u201crequired to consider \nRule 60(b) finality and Rule 15(a) liberality in tandem\u201d \nwhen plaintiffs seek to reopen a judgment in order to \nfile an amended complaint.  Id.  It thus faulted the \nDistrict Court for analyzing Respondents\u2019 Rule 60(b) \nmotion \u201cunder only Rule 60(b)\u2019s standard.\u201d  Id.   \nThat reasoning is indefensible.  The Second \nCircuit\u2019s outlier balancing test effectively rewrites the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.  It destroys the \nfinality principles embodied in Rule 60(b).  It \nencourages wasteful and pernicious litigation tactics.  \nIt imbues uncertainty.  And it contravenes this Court\u2019s \nprecedents at every turn.  This Court should reverse. \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe District Court\u2019s opinion dismissing the case \nwith prejudice on January 14, 2020 is reported at 432 \nF.

In this case, Respondents \ndeclined multiple invitations and opportunities to \namend their complaint.  The District Court then \ndismissed their complaint with prejudice, and the \nSecond Circuit affirmed.  Only then did Respondents \nask the District Court to vacate the judgment so they \ncould file an amended complaint that would include \npreviously available facts.  The District Court denied \nthe \nmotion \nunder \nRule \n60(b)(6)\u2019s \nwell-settled \nstandard.  But the Second Circuit reversed, based on \nan anomalous \u201cbalanc[ing]\u201d test that requires district \ncourts to heed Rule 15(a)\u2019s \u201cliberal pleading principles\u201d \nwhen addressing a Rule 60(b)(6) motion to reopen a \nfinal judgment for the purpose of filing an amended \ncomplaint. \nThe question presented is: \nWhether Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent standard applies \nto a post-judgment request to vacate for the purpose of \nfiling an amended complaint. \n \n\nii \n \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nPetitioner BLOM Bank SAL was defendant in the \nUnited States District Court for the Eastern District \nof New York and appellee in the United States Court \nof Appeals for the Second Circuit.  \nRespondents Michal Honickman, Individually and \nfor the Estate of Howard Goldstein, Eugene \nGoldstein, Lorraine Goldstein, Richard Goldstein, \nBarbara Goldstein Ingardia, Michael Goldstein, \nChana Freedman, David Goldstein, Moses Strauss, \nPhilip Strauss, Bluma Strauss, Ahron Strauss, Roisie \nEngelman, Joseph Strauss, Tzvi Weiss, Leib Weiss, \nIndividually and for the Estate of Malka Weiss, \nYitzchak Weiss, Yeruchaim Weiss, Esther Deutsch, \nMatanya Nathansen, Individually and for the Estate \nof Tehilla Nathansen, Chana Nathansen, Individually \nand for the Estate of Tehilla Nathansen, Yehudit \nNathansen, S.N., a minor, Hezekial Toporowitch, \nPearl B.

As those precedents make clear, obtaining \nrelief from a final judgment under Rule 60(b)(6) \n\u201crequires a showing of \u2018extraordinary circumstances.\u2019\u201d  \nGonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524, 536 (2005).  And \nthose circumstances must demonstrate \u201cthat the \n[moving] party is faultless.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. \nBrunswick Assocs. Ltd. P\u2019ship, 507 U.S. 380, 393 \n(1993).  After all, \u201c[t]here must be an end to litigation \nsomeday, and free, calculated, deliberate choices are \nnot to be relieved from.\u201d  Ackermann v. United States, \n340 U.S. 193, 198 (1950). \nIt could hardly be otherwise.  Our adversarial \nsystem of civil justice could not function without a \nscrupulous regard for the conclusiveness of judgments \nprofessing to settle the parties\u2019 rights.  Courts have \nrecognized that fundamental precept since the \nFounding.  Consistent with that history and tradition, \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure afford district \ncourts the power to revisit a final judgment through \nRule 60(b) only in \u201ca limited set of circumstances.\u201d  \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. at 528.  And they strictly prohibit \na party from moving for such relief more than a year \nafter judgment if that party is even \u201cpartly to blame \nfor the delay.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs., 507 U.S. at 393; see \nFed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1), (c)(1).  \nFor decades, lower courts have faithfully applied \nthese well-settled principles of judgment finality.  And \nthey have uniformly rejected attempts by plaintiffs to \navoid Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent requirements by \n\n2 \n \nappealing to Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policy.  \nIndeed, the two inquiries are entirely separate.  Rule \n15(a) applies before trial and judgment, while Rule 60 \napplies after a final judgment.  Accordingly, \u201cif a \nplaintiff seeks to reopen a case under Rule 60(b) in \norder to file an amended complaint, she must satisfy \none of the Rule 60(b) grounds\u201d and have the judgment \nset aside \u201cbefore a court may consider her motion to \namend.\u201d  Daulatzai v. Maryland, 97 F.4th 166, 178 \n(4th Cir. 2024).  As the Fourth Circuit aptly put it \nearlier this year, adopting a contrary rule would have \nplaced it \u201calone in the Nation in collapsing the Rule \n60(b) standard with the standard for Rule 15(a).\u201d  Id. \nat 177. \nBut the decision below did just that\u2014in a case \nwhere Respondents repeatedly declined to amend \ntheir complaint in the normal course.  By rejecting the \nDistrict Court\u2019s multiple invitations to amend their \ncomplaint, Respondents deliberately chose to proceed \non that complaint as pled and take their chances on a \nmotion to dismiss.  The District Court eventually \ndismissed the complaint with prejudice, and the \nSecond Circuit affirmed the dismissal after full merits \nbriefing, oral argument, and supplemental briefing.  \nAt no time during those proceedings did Respondents \nseek leave to amend.   \nThen, more than 18 months after the dismissal \nwith prejudice\u2014and after that dismissal was affirmed \non appeal\u2014Respondents filed a Rule 60(b)(6) motion \nto vacate the judgment so they could restart the \nprocess and try again with an amended complaint.  \nThe District Court rejected that effort by properly \napplying Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent standard.  It \n\n3 \n \nemphasized that Respondents had \u201cnot demonstrated \nany extraordinary circumstances\u201d and had engaged in \na \u201cseries of deliberate choices not to cure the \ndeficiencies identified in their pleading by [Petitioner] \nand th[e] Court.\u201d  Pet.App.14, 19.  The District Court \ntherefore permissibly exercised its discretion to deny \nRespondents\u2019 motion. \nThe \nSecond \nCircuit \nnevertheless \nreversed.  \nApplying an atextual balancing test adopted by a split \npanel in Mandala v. NTT Data, Inc., 88 F.4th 353 (2d \nCir. 2023), the Second Circuit held that the District \nCourt abused its discretion by failing to \u201cgive \u2018due \nregard\u2019 to \u2018both the philosophy favoring finality of \njudgments . . . and the liberal amendment policy of \nRule 15(a).\u2019\u201d  Pet.App.7 (alteration in original) \n(quoting Mandala, 88 F.4th at 361).  In the Second \nCircuit\u2019s view, district courts are \u201crequired to consider \nRule 60(b) finality and Rule 15(a) liberality in tandem\u201d \nwhen plaintiffs seek to reopen a judgment in order to \nfile an amended complaint.  Id.  It thus faulted the \nDistrict Court for analyzing Respondents\u2019 Rule 60(b) \nmotion \u201cunder only Rule 60(b)\u2019s standard.\u201d  Id.   \nThat reasoning is indefensible.  The Second \nCircuit\u2019s outlier balancing test effectively rewrites the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.  It destroys the \nfinality principles embodied in Rule 60(b).  It \nencourages wasteful and pernicious litigation tactics.  \nIt imbues uncertainty.  And it contravenes this Court\u2019s \nprecedents at every turn.  This Court should reverse. \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe District Court\u2019s opinion dismissing the case \nwith prejudice on January 14, 2020 is reported at 432 \nF.

The petition for writ of certiorari was timely \nfiled on May 29, 2024, and granted on October 4, 2024.  \nThis Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nFEDERAL RULES INVOLVED \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) governs \nmotions for \u201cRelief from a Final Judgment.\u201d  It \nprovides five specific grounds for relief.  See Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 60(b)(1)-(5).  Rule 60(b)(6) then states that \u201cthe \ncourt may relieve a party or its legal representative \nfrom a final judgment, order, or proceeding for . . . any \nother reason that justifies relief.\u201d \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a) governs \n\u201cAmendments Before Trial.\u201d  Rule 15(a)(2) provides \nthat \u201ca party may amend its pleading only with the \nopposing party\u2019s written consent or the court\u2019s leave.  \nThe court should freely give leave when justice so \nrequires.\u201d \n\n5 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. The Initial District Court Proceedings \nRespondents filed this lawsuit on January 1, 2019, \na day before the statute of limitations expired and \nnearly sixteen years after the latest of the events in \nquestion.  JA.1; see Pub. L. No. 112-239, \u00a7 1251(c), 126 \nStat. 1632, 2017-18 (2013) (extending the ordinary \nlimitations period for certain Anti-Terrorism Act \nclaims to January 2, 2019).  Respondents are victims \nand the families of victims of terrorist attacks carried \nout by Hamas between December 1, 2001, and August \n19, 2003.  JA.7-81.  As Petitioner explained in the \nproceedings below, it categorically abhors terrorism, it \nhas no connection to Hamas, and it is not legally or \nfactually \nresponsible \nfor \nRespondents\u2019 \ninjuries.  \nJA.160-62, 168-72.1   \nThe complaint accuses Petitioner of aiding and \nabetting those attacks through a daisy chain of \nspeculation.  In particular, Respondents allege that \n \n1  Respondents have filed almost a dozen more lawsuits \nagainst other defendants in the nearly sixteen years following the \nattacks, all seeking damages for the same injuries alleged here.  \nSee Kirschenbaum v. Islamic Repub. of Iran, No. 1:03-cv-01708-\nRCL (D.D.C.); Sokolow v. Palestine Liberation Org., No. 1:04-cv-\n00397-GBD-RLE (S.D.N.Y); Linde v. Arab Bank, PLC, No. 1:04-\ncv-02799-BMC-PK (E.D.N.Y.); Wolf v. Credit Lyonnais, S.A., No. \n07-cv-00914 (E.D.N.Y.); Applebaum v. Nat\u2019l Westminster Bank, \nPLC, No. 1:07-cv-00916-DLI-RML (E.D.N.Y.); Beer v. ASSA \nCorp., No. 1:13-cv-01848-LAP (S.D.N.Y.); Singer v. Bank of \nPalestine, No. 1:19-cv-00006-ENV-RML (E.D.N.Y.); Averbach v. \nCairo Amman Bank, No. 1:19-cv-00004-GHW-KHP (S.D.N.Y.); \nMiller v. Credit Lyonnais, S.A., No. 1:19-cv-00002-DLI-RML \n(E.D.N.Y.); Miller v. Nat\u2019l Westminster Bank, PLC, 1:19-cv-00001-\nDLI-RML (E.D.N.Y.); Spetner v. Palestine Inv. Bank, No. 1:19-cv-\n00005-EK-JAM (E.D.N.Y.). \n\n6 \n \nPetitioner provided routine financial services to three \ncustomers:  Sanabil, Subul al-Khair, and Union of \nGood (together, the \u201cThree Customers\u201d).  JA.106, 116, \n120.  Though the Complaint spans 645 paragraphs, it \nsays relatively little about the Three Customers (or \nPetitioner).  See generally JA.1-122.  In fact, none of \nthe Three Customers was itself alleged to have \nengaged in acts of terrorism.  Instead, \u201cthe Three \nCustomers were alleged only to have supported \norphans in Palestinian refugee camps.\u201d  Pet.App.52 \nn.21.   \nRespondents pled their claim under the Anti-\nTerrorism Act (\u201cATA\u201d), as amended by the Justice \nAgainst Sponsors of Terrorism Act (\u201cJASTA\u201d).  JA.121-\n22.  Under the ATA, a United States national \u201cinjured \nin his or her person, property, or business by reason of \nan act of international terrorism, or his or her estate, \nsurvivors, or heirs, may sue therefor in any \nappropriate district court of the United States.\u201d  18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2333(a).  JASTA provides for secondary \nliability against \u201cany person who aids and abets, by \nknowingly providing substantial assistance, or who \nconspires with the person who committed such an act \nof international terrorism.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 2333(d)(2).   \nTo impose secondary liability, JASTA requires \u201cthat \nthe defendant consciously and culpably \u2018participated\u2019 \nin a wrongful act so as to help \u2018make it succeed.\u2019\u201d  \nTwitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, 598 U.S. 471, 493 (2023) \n(alteration adopted) (quoting Nye & Nissen v. United \nStates, 326 U.S. 613, 619 (1949)).  And \u201cJASTA further \nrestricts secondary liability by requiring that the \u2018act \nof international terrorism\u2019 be \u2018committed, planned, or \nauthorized by\u2019 a foreign terrorist organization \n\n7 \n \ndesignated as such \u2018as of the date on which such act of \ninternational terrorism was committed, planned, or \nauthorized.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 495 (quoting 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2333(d)(2)).  Thus, \u201cit is not enough\u201d that a \ndefendant has \u201cgiven substantial assistance to a \ntranscendent \u2018enterprise\u2019 separate from and floating \nabove all the actionable wrongs that constitute it.\u201d  Id.  \n\u201cRather, a defendant must have aided and abetted (by \nknowingly providing substantial assistance) another \nperson in the commission of the actionable wrong\u2014\nhere, an act of international terrorism.\u201d  Id.  \nUnder JASTA, one of the three elements for aiding-\nand-abetting liability is that \u201cthe defendant must be \ngenerally aware of his role as part of an overall illegal \nor tortious activity at the time that he provides the \nassistance.\u201d  Id. at 486 (emphasis added) (quoting \nHalberstam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472, 477 (D.C. Cir. \n1983)).  Accordingly, to state a claim, Respondents \nneeded to plausibly allege that Petitioner was aware \nof a link between the Three Customers and Hamas \u201cat \nthe time\u201d Petitioner allegedly provided services to \nthem.  Id. (citation omitted).  But they failed to do so, \neven though their complaint was filed more than \nfifteen years after the latest of the attacks.  \nPetitioner made this point clearly and repeatedly \nthroughout the proceedings below.  Before moving to \ndismiss, Petitioner submitted a three-page letter \nsummarizing the grounds for its contemplated motion, \nas required by the District Court\u2019s Individual \nPractices.  JA.142-47.  Petitioner\u2019s lead argument was \nthat the complaint did not plausibly allege the general \nawareness element necessary to state their JASTA \n\n8 \n \nclaim.  JA.144.2  This argument, in turn, relied on the \ncomplaint\u2019s failure to allege that Petitioner was aware \nof any connection between the Three Customers and \nHamas before the attacks\u2014that is, by August 19, \n2003.  JA.145.  The complaint acknowledged that the \nThree Customers \u201cengaged in actual charitable work.\u201d  \nJA.143.  They were only \u201clater linked to Hamas.\u201d  Id.   \nIn response to this letter, Respondents chose not to \namend.  See JA.148-55.  They instead stood on the \nallegations in their complaint.  See id. \nAt a pre-motion conference, the District Court \nasked Respondents\u2019 counsel: \u201cAre there any additional \nfacts you could add to the allegations that the \ndefendant is challenging here or are you comfortable \nstanding on your complaint as it is?\u201d  Pet.App.93 \n(emphasis added).  Respondents\u2019 counsel declined the \nCourt\u2019s invitation: \u201cNo, I think we are prepared to \nbrief it based on the arguments presented in the pre-\nmotion letter.\u201d  Id.  The Court then asked whether \nRespondents would seek leave to amend if the Court \ngranted \nPetitioner\u2019s \nmotion \nto \ndismiss. \n \nId.  \nRespondents\u2019 counsel unequivocally stated that they \n\u201cwould not seek leave to amend.\u201d  Pet.App.94. \nAfter the conference, the District Court issued an \norder memorializing the fact that the court \u201coffered \n[Respondents] \nan \nopportunity \nto \namend \ntheir \n \n2  Petitioner also argued that Respondents failed to plausibly \nallege the knowing provision of substantial assistance to the \nalleged terrorist activities or any facts suggesting that \nPetitioner\u2019s routine banking services directly assisted the acts \nthat caused Respondents\u2019 injuries.  JA.145-47; see also Twitter, \n598 U.S. at 506 (summarizing principles of aiding-and-abetting \nliability under JASTA). \n\n9 \n \ncomplaint\u201d to \u201cadd additional information in response \nto the arguments raised by [Petitioner],\u201d but they \n\u201cdeclined to do so and represented that they would not \nbe seeking to amend their Complaint in this regard.\u201d  \nJA.156.  Respondents stuck to that position, and they \ndid not seek leave to amend their complaint. \nA few weeks later, Petitioner moved to dismiss \nconsistent with its pre-motion letter.  JA.159.  Among \nother arguments, it reiterated that the complaint \nfailed to plausibly allege that Petitioner knew of the \nThree Customers\u2019 purported affiliation with Hamas \nbefore the alleged attacks.  JA.160-61, 174-85.  \nRespondents opposed that motion and, in doing so, \nonce again stood on their papers.  JA.197-241.  They \ndid not move to amend or ask for an opportunity to \nreplead \nshould \nthe \nDistrict \nCourt \nfind \ntheir \nallegations lacking. \nThe District Court then held oral argument.  \nPet.App.100.  There, Petitioner\u2019s counsel again \nemphasized the complaint\u2019s failure to connect the \nThree Customers to Hamas \u201cat the time of any of the \nattacks.\u201d  Pet.App.109.  \u201cAt the very most, what the \ncomplaint alleges is that BLOM provided financial \nservices to three entities, two of which were later \ndetermined by the [U.S.] government to have provided \nfinancial support to [Hamas].\u201d  Pet.App.108 (emphasis \nadded). \nThe District Court pressed Respondents\u2019 counsel \non this pleading deficiency, asking \u201c[w]here do you \nallege in your complaint that BLOM Bank knew that \nthese account holders are alter egos or are a part of, or \nthe same as [Hamas]?\u201d  Pet.App.121.  The District \nCourt then offered Respondents\u2019 counsel yet another \n\n10 \n \nopportunity to amend the complaint, specifically with \nrespect to Petitioner\u2019s alleged \u201cknowledge\u201d: \nThe Court: I do recall that you did not want an \nopportunity to try to replead . . . . And I think \nthe Second Circuit may not encourage district \ncourts to allow another round of pleading if \nthere\u2019s been a declination of an opportunity to \nreplead . . . . So everything I need to consider in \nterms of sufficiency of your pleading is going to \nbe found in the complaint that\u2019s filed in this \ncase, correct? \nMr. Radine: Yes, Your Honor.  The\u2014 \nThe Court: There are no facts that you would \nhave to offer to address some of the contentions \nof \nthe \ndefendants \nregarding \nknowledge, \nespecially? \nMr. Radine: I think we could always add \nallegations, but the\u2014we believe the complaint \ngoes far enough in saying that BLOM . . . was \ngenerally aware of its role in th[e] [il]licit \nconduct . . . . \nPet.App.124-25 (emphasis added). \nThe District Court granted Petitioner\u2019s motion to \ndismiss, holding in relevant part that Respondents \nhad not \u201cplausibly allege[d] that [Petitioner] was \ngenerally aware of any connection between the Three \nCustomers and Hamas\u201d \u201cat the time it provided \nfinancial \nservices \nto \nthe \nThree \nCustomers.\u201d  \nPet.App.73-75.   \nThe court noted that it \u201ctypically grants plaintiffs \nan opportunity to amend their complaints following \ndismissal, to address any deficiencies raised by the \n\n11 \n \nCourt\u2019s order.\u201d  Pet.App.85.  However, Respondents \nhere \u201c[did] not request leave to amend, and specifically \ndeclined the Court\u2019s offer to do so.\u201d  Id.  Accordingly, \n\u201c[i]n \nlight \nof \n[Respondents\u2019] \nrejection \nof \nthe \nopportunity to amend their pleading at the pre-motion \nconference, and the fact that they ha[d] not identified \nany additional facts they could allege which would \naddress the deficiencies in their complaint,\u201d the \nDistrict Court dismissed the complaint with prejudice.  \nPet.App.86.   \nB. Respondents\u2019 Initial Appeal to the Second \nCircuit \nRather than request leave to amend or file a Rule \n59(e) \nmotion \nfor \nreconsideration, \nRespondents \nappealed.  In that appeal, they did not challenge the \nDistrict Court\u2019s decision to dismiss without leave to \namend.  Pet.App.16 n.4.  They instead doubled down \non their argument that their existing allegations were \nenough to \u201cstate a claim to relief that is plausible on \nits face.\u201d  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) \n(citation omitted).   \nAfter oral argument, the Second Circuit held the \nappeal in abeyance pending its decision in Kaplan v. \nLebanese Canadian Bank, SAL, 999 F.3d 842 (2d Cir. \n2021).  It also ordered the parties to submit \nsupplemental briefs addressing the significance of \nthat decision.  JA.257-58.  At this point, Respondents \nhad yet another opportunity to ask the appellate court \nto remand or grant them leave to amend in light of the \nKaplan decision.  Once again, though, they did \nneither.  They instead relied on their complaint as pled \nand insisted that the allegations therein stated a \nclaim.  JA.259-81.   \n\n12 \n \nThe Second Circuit affirmed the District Court\u2019s \ndismissal because the complaint\u2019s \u201callegations [did] \nnot support an inference that [Petitioner] was aware \nof the Three Customers\u2019 ties with Hamas prior to the \nrelevant attacks.\u201d  Pet.App.49.  Respondents did not \nseek rehearing.  Nor did they belatedly request that \nthe Second Circuit modify its decision to remand and \npermit Respondents leave to amend the complaint. \nC. The Post-Judgment Proceedings \nRespondents instead returned to the District Court \nand moved to vacate the District Court\u2019s now-affirmed \njudgment under Rule 60(b)(6) so they could amend \ntheir complaint and return to square one.  JA.315-22.  \nThe District Court held a pre-motion conference, at \nwhich it ordered briefing \u201conly as to the issue of \nvacatur.\u201d  JA.509.   \nAfter briefing, the District Court held that \n\u201c[Respondents] \nhave \nnot \ndemonstrated \nany \nextraordinary circumstances warranting relief under \nRule 60(b)(6).\u201d  Pet.App.14.  It also explained that \nRespondents had not demonstrated that they would \nsuffer an \u201cextreme and undue hardship\u201d from letting \nthe judgment stand because they \u201chave had ample \nopportunity to pursue all legal avenues available to \nthem for relief.\u201d  Pet.App.15-16 (quotation marks \nomitted).  \u201cFundamentally, [Respondents] seek to \namend their complaint after declining two prior \nopportunities to do so, and after unsuccessfully \nappealing the dismissal of that complaint with \nprejudice.\u201d  Pet.App.16.  And they sought to start the \nprocess all over again on the sole basis that they \nwished to plead new facts that were previously \navailable.  Pet.App.15.  The District Court thus \n\n13 \n \ndecided, in its discretion, to leave the final judgment \nin place given Respondents\u2019 \u201cdocumented series of \ndeliberate choices not to cure the deficiencies \nidentified in their pleading by [Petitioner] and [the \nDistrict] Court.\u201d  Pet.App.19.  \nRespondents appealed again.  Petitioner defended \nthe District Court\u2019s ruling by arguing that Rule \n60(b)(6)\u2019s stringent standards governed Respondents\u2019 \nmotion, that Rule 15(a) had no role to play in that \nanalysis, and that Respondents fell far short of \ndemonstrating \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d given \ntheir many earlier refusals to seek leave to amend.  \nSee 2d Cir. Dkt. No. 42, at 37-49, 55-59.  After oral \nargument, the Second Circuit issued its decision in \nMandala, 88 F.4th 353.   \nIn Mandala, a split panel held that, when a losing \nparty seeks post-judgment relief under Rule 60(b)(6) \nto amend its complaint, a district court must balance \nRule 60(b)(6)\u2019s finality principles with Rule 15(a)(2)\u2019s \n\u201cliberal amendment policy.\u201d  Id. at 361 (quoting \nWilliams v. Citigroup Inc., 659 F.3d 208, 213 (2d Cir. \n2011) (per curiam)).  And, where a losing party has not \nyet filed an amended complaint, the Second Circuit \nheld that it is an abuse of discretion for a district court \nto deny a Rule 60(b)(6) motion based solely on the \nmovant\u2019s \u201cfailure to demonstrate adequate grounds for \nrelief under Rule 60.\u201d  Id. at 362 & n.5.  In doing so, \nthe court flipped the burden from Rule 60 movants \n(who \nnormally \nmust \nprove \nextraordinary \ncircumstances) to their opponent (to show that the \nmovant should not receive another bite at the apple).  \nAs Judge Sullivan explained in dissent, that defies \n\u201cthe principle that Rule 60(b)(6) affords litigants an \n\n14 \n \nextraordinary remedy and effectively holds that such \nrelief is available in the ordinary course.\u201d  Id. at 368 \n(Sullivan, J., dissenting).  Judge Sullivan also \nexplained that the Second Circuit\u2019s approach \u201cerode[s] \nthe finality of judgments,\u201d \u201csignificantly undermine[s] \nthe important purposes served by Rule 60(b),\u201d and \n\u201cincrease[s] the workload of busy district court judges \nwho carry the heaviest burden in our system of civil \njustice.\u201d  Id. at 369. \nThe Second Circuit then applied and reaffirmed \nMandala\u2019s balancing test in the decision below.  It held \nthat \u201cthe district court exceeded its discretion by \nbasing its ruling on an erroneous view of the law \nbecause it failed to balance Rule 60(b)\u2019s finality \nprinciples \nand \nRule \n15(a)\u2019s \nliberal \npleading \nprinciples.\u201d  Pet.App.7-8.  When presented with a \nmotion to vacate for the purposes of amendment, the \nSecond Circuit said, \u201cthe district court is required to \nconsider Rule 60(b) finality and Rule 15(a) liberality \nin tandem.\u201d  Pet.App.7.  Thus, the Second Circuit held \nthat the District Court abused its discretion because it \nanalyzed the Rule 60(b) motion here \u201cunder only Rule \n60(b)\u2019s standard.\u201d  Id. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s outlier approach contradicts \nthe text, structure, and history of the Federal Rules, \nand it violates decades of this Court\u2019s precedents.  It \njettisons Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s well-settled and exacting \n\u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d \nstandard \nfor \na \nnebulous balancing test that wrongly smuggles Rule \n15(a)\u2019s \u201cliberal pleading principles\u201d into the calculus \nfor vacating a final judgment.  The decision below \nshould therefore be reversed, and the District Court\u2019s \n\n15 \n \ndenial of Respondents\u2019 Rule 60(b)(6) motion should be \nreinstated so this case can finally come to an end. \nI.  A party seeking to set aside an affirmed \njudgment for the purpose of filing an amended \ncomplaint must first satisfy Rule 60(b)\u2019s stringent \nstandards for vacating the judgment.  That common-\nsense position has been adopted by every other Court \nof Appeals.  And the Second Circuit\u2019s contrary \nbalancing approach is fundamentally mistaken. \nA.  Rule 60(b) imposes an intentionally high hurdle \nfor relief\u2014and understandably so.  This Court has \nlong underscored the profound importance of finality \nto our civil justice system.  After all, litigants, courts, \nand the public alike all share an interest in the \nconclusiveness of judgments and the peace and repose \nthat such finality brings.  Courts since the Founding \nhave thus consistently refused to reopen matters that \nhave been litigated to final judgment\u2014except in the \nmost compelling circumstances. \nRule 60(b) is rooted in that tradition.  It codified \nmany of the narrow, common-law exceptions for relief \nfrom a final judgment, along with a catchall in Rule \n60(b)(6) for similarly extraordinary circumstances \nthat are not explicitly covered by subsections \n(1) through (5).  Rule 60(b) therefore demands a \nscrupulous regard for finality.  Indeed, this Court has \nrepeatedly emphasized that Rule 60(b)(6) requires \n\u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d to justify vacating a \nfinal judgment.  See, e.g., Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 536. \nThat is the standard that applies here.  Rule 60(b) \nprovides the exclusive mechanism for \u201cRelief from a \nFinal Judgment\u201d more than 28 days after entry.  And \nRule 15(a) has no place in that inquiry.  Instead, Rule \n\n16 \n \n15(a) is limited to \u201cAmendments Before Trial.\u201d  There \nis not even a pending complaint to amend when an \naction has been finally dismissed with prejudice.  The \nsuit is over, and the claim is extinguished by the \ndoctrine of res judicata. \nAccordingly, plaintiffs cannot reopen a final \njudgment by invoking Rule 15(a)\u2019s policies without \nfirst meeting Rule 60(b)\u2019s restrictive standards.  And \nwhere, as here, plaintiffs seek relief under Rule \n60(b)(6), \nthey \nmust \nshow \n\u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d not covered by any other provision of \nRule 60(b).  To hold otherwise would enable plaintiffs \nto sidestep Rule 60(b)\u2019s deliberately narrow grounds \nfor post-judgment relief and thwart the Rule\u2019s respect \nfor finality. \nB.  Moreover, this Court has long held that a party \nmust be \u201cfaultless\u201d to obtain relief under Rule 60(b)(6).  \nPioneer Inv. Servs., 507 U.S. at 393; see Ackermann, \n340 U.S. at 197-202.  That is because Rule 60(b)(1) \nspecifically authorizes motions for relief premised on \n\u201cmistake, \ninadvertence, \nsurprise, \nor \nexcusable \nneglect,\u201d while strictly limiting the window for \nbringing such a motion to one year after judgment.  \nRule 60(b)(6) cannot be used to circumvent those \nlimitations.  If it could, then Rule 60(b)\u2019s provision for \n\u201cexcusable neglect\u201d would become superfluous. \nNor can Rule 60(b)(6) be used to circumvent basic \nprinciples of waiver.  That has been firmly settled by \nthis Court for decades.  See Ackermann, 340 U.S. at \n197-98.  Accordingly, where a plaintiff deliberately \nwaives the right to amend its complaint in the \nordinary course, it cannot seek a mulligan post-\n\n17 \n \njudgment after that considered choice has led to a \ndismissal with prejudice. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s outlier approach nullifies \nthese foundational principles.  Rather than requiring \nthe moving party to be faultless, the Second Circuit \nhas crafted a muddled balancing test that saves \nplaintiffs from their own litigation choices.  And the \ncourt has eschewed finality even where\u2014as here\u2014the \nmoving parties repeatedly and explicitly declined to \namend their complaint before judgment.  \nC.  The Second Circuit provided no persuasive \njustification for its balancing test.   \n1. It never even attempted to ground its analysis \nin the text of the Federal Rules.  In fact, as noted \nabove, its approach is at odds with the text and context \nof both Rule 15(a) and Rule 60(b). \n2. Moreover, by diluting Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s standard \nwith Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal repleading policy, the Second \nCircuit rendered Rule 60(b) internally inconsistent in \nat least three ways.  First, its balancing test enables \nplaintiffs to evade the one-year limitations period for \nRule 60(b) motions premised on \u201cexcusable neglect,\u201d \nby compelling district courts to reopen final judgments \noutside that timeframe based on previously omitted \nallegations.  Second, it thwarts the time limits for Rule \n60(b) motions premised on \u201cmistake\u201d of law or fact that \noccurred in the initial proceedings.  Third, it allows \nparties to reopen proceedings based on factual \nallegations they could have made pre-judgment\u2014even \nthough Rule 60(b)(2) specifically limits relief based on \nnew facts to those that could not have been previously \ndiscovered through due diligence.  \n\n18 \n \n3. The Second Circuit\u2019s test finds no support in \nprecedent either.  The decision below relied on Foman \nv. Davis, 371 U.S. 178 (1962).  But Foman is \ninapposite.  That case involved a Rule 59(e) motion, \nwhile this case concerns a Rule 60(b) motion.  There is \nno reason to conflate the standards for those two rules.  \nRules 59(e) and 60(b) differ in material ways and \nimpose different standards for relief by their own \nterms.  So this Court has refused to treat Rule 59(e) \nand Rule 60(b) motions as fungible.  See Banister v. \nDavis, 590 U.S. 504, 517-21 (2020). \n4. Finally, \neven \nif \nany \ninterpretive \ndoubt \nremained, this Court must \u201cconstrue[]\u201d the Rules to \n\u201csecure \nthe \njust, \nspeedy, \nand \ninexpensive \ndetermination of every action.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 1.  Far \nfrom advancing these overarching objectives, the \nSecond Circuit\u2019s test destroys them.  It allows the \nreopening of final judgments after plaintiffs have \nwillingly induced the judiciary to render a final \njudgment (and here an appellate ruling) based on their \noperative pleadings.  It thus invites a wasteful \nfeedback loop of relitigation.  As this case shows, that \napproach is neither just nor speedy nor inexpensive.   \nAt bottom, the Second Circuit erred in collapsing \nthe Rule 15(a) and Rule 60(b) inquiries.  The two rules \npose distinct hurdles.  The former applies before final \njudgment, and the latter applies after final judgment.  \nAs a result, Respondents could not seek leave to \namend unless they first proved \u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d beyond their control that would justify \nthe reopening of the final judgment dismissing their \ncase, which had already been affirmed on appeal. \n\n19 \n \nII. Respondents came nowhere close to meeting \nthat stringent standard\u2014and the District Court \ncertainly did not abuse its discretion in so finding. \nA.  There are no extraordinary circumstances here.  \nRespondents do not dispute that their late-breaking \nallegations were previously available to them.  They \nmerely argue that the Second Circuit \u201cclarified\u201d the \npleading standard for JASTA claims in their appeal.  \nBut the Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal with \nprejudice because\u2014as the District Court recognized\u2014\nRespondents failed to plausibly allege that Petitioner \nknew of the Three Customers\u2019 supposed connection to \nHamas at the time it allegedly provided routine \nbanking services to them.  And, in all events, mere \nclarification of the law is not extraordinary.  It is what \nappellate courts do day in and day out.  Indeed, this \nCourt has held that even an outright change in the law \ndoes not warrant relief under Rule 60(b)(6).  See \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. at 537.  The District Court thus did \nnot abuse its discretion in finding a lack of \nextraordinary circumstances. \nB.  On the contrary, the District Court would have \nnecessarily abused its discretion had it granted \nRespondents\u2019 motion.  This Court has made clear that \nit is an abuse of discretion to override a party\u2019s \ndeliberate waiver.  Here, Respondents waived or \nforfeited multiple opportunities to amend their \ncomplaint.  They first explicitly rejected the District \nCourt\u2019s invitation to amend at the pre-motion \nconference, after Petitioner had already pointed out \nthe \ndeficiencies \nin \nRespondents\u2019 \npleadings.  \nRespondents again rebuffed the District Court\u2019s \ninvitation to amend at oral argument.  They declined \n\n20 \n \nto file a Rule 59(e) motion to ask the District Court for \na chance to replead after they lost.  They chose not to \nappeal the \u201cwith prejudice\u201d component of the District \nCourt\u2019s dismissal.  And they never asked the Second \nCircuit for leave to replead if the court found their \nallegations lacking\u2014not in their opening brief, not in \ntheir reply brief, not at oral argument, and not in their \nsupplemental brief.   \nRespondents were thus far from faultless in the \ndelay.  Their own deliberate choices created the \ncircumstances from which they now seek relief.  Rule \n60(b)(6) does not save them from those strategic and \n\u201cvoluntary\u201d decisions.  Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 200.  \nGiven their repeated waivers of the chance to amend, \nRespondents could not even satisfy the more forgiving \nstandard for relief under Rule 59(e). \nFor all these reasons, this Court should reverse the \ndecision below and render judgment for Petitioner. \nARGUMENT \nI. A Party Seeking To Vacate A Final Judgment \nFor Purposes Of Amendment Must First \nSatisfy Rule 60(b). \nRelying on a series of Second Circuit precedents, \nthe decision below held that the District Court abused \nits discretion by \u201crequiring Plaintiffs to successfully \nnavigate Rule 60(b)\u2019s finality gauntlet before they \ncould invoke Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal repleading policy.\u201d  \nPet.App.8.  That, however, is precisely what the \nDistrict Court was obligated to do.  The Second \nCircuit\u2019s contrary position cannot be squared with \nRule 60(b)\u2019s text, its broader context, or this Court\u2019s \nprecedents.  It has thus been unanimously rejected by \n\n21 \n \nevery other Court of Appeals.3  That overwhelming \nmajority view is correct, and the Second Circuit\u2019s \noutlier balancing test is wrong. \nA. Rule 60(b)(6) Requires a Movant to Show \n\u201cExtraordinary Circumstances.\u201d \nThis Court has long extolled the importance of \nfinality to our system of justice.  Indeed, \u201cthe very \nobject for which civil courts have been established\u201d is \n\u201cto secure the peace and repose of society by the \nsettlement \nof \nmatters \ncapable \nof \njudicial \ndetermination.\u201d  Southern Pac. R.R. Co. v. United \nStates, 168 U.S. 1, 49 (1897).  \u201c[T]he aid of judicial \ntribunals would not be invoked\u201d if \u201cconclusiveness did \nnot attend the judgments of such tribunals.\u201d  Id.  For \nthat reason, courts since the Founding have \nrecognized that only \u201ca very strong case\u201d may justify \ndisturbing \u201cthe public interest and policy to make an \nend to litigation.\u201d  Ocean Ins.

Farrand ed., 1807). \nThat understanding persisted up through the \nadoption of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in \n1938.  By that time, a patchwork of methods had \ndeveloped for litigants seeking relief after a court\u2019s \nentry of final judgment and the expiration of the term.  \nSee Comment, Temporal Aspects of the Finality of \nJudgments\u2014The Significance of Federal Rule 60(b), \n17 U. Chi. L. Rev. 664, 664-65 (1950).  But courts \nalways remained \u201ccautious in exercising their power\u201d \nto reopen settled matters.  Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. \nHartford-Empire Co., 322 U.S. 238, 244 (1944).  Relief \ncontinued to be reserved only for \u201ccertain limited \nsituations.\u201d  James Wm. Moore & Elizabeth B. A. \nRogers, Federal Relief from Civil Judgments, 55 Yale \nL.J. 623, 627 (1946). \nRule 60(b) codifies many of these \u201cwell-recognized \nand concrete exceptions to the finality principle.\u201d  \nMary Kay Kane, Relief from Federal Judgments: A \nMorass Unrelieved by a Rule, 30 Hastings L.J. 41, 43 \n(1978); see Banister, 590 U.S. at 518.  These specific \nexceptions \ninclude \n(1) \u201cmistake, \ninadvertence, \nsurprise, or excusable neglect,\u201d (2) \u201cnewly discovered \nevidence,\u201d (3) \u201cfraud,\u201d (4) a \u201cvoid\u201d judgment, or \n(5) situations where \u201cthe judgment has been satisfied, \nreleased, or discharged; it is based on an earlier \njudgment that has been reversed or vacated; or \napplying it prospectively is no longer equitable.\u201d  Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 60(b)(1)-(5).  Rule 60(b) also includes a \n\n23 \n \ncatchall provision for \u201cany other reason that justifies \nrelief.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6). \nThat final subsection\u2019s berth has been tightly \ncircumscribed.  \u201cWhen faced with a catchall phrase \nlike [Rule 60(b)(6)], courts do not necessarily afford it \nthe broadest possible construction it can bear.\u201d  \nHarrington v. Purdue Pharma L.P., 144 S. Ct. 2071, \n2082 (2024).  That is because readers \u201cgenerally \nappreciate that the catchall must be interpreted in \nlight of its surrounding context and read to \u2018embrace \nonly objects similar in nature\u2019 to the specific examples \npreceding it.\u201d  Id. (quoting Epic Sys. Corp. v. Lewis, \n584 U.S. 497, 512 (2018)); accord Hall St. Assocs., \nL.L.C. v.

Ct. at 2082, this \nCourt has long construed Rule 60(b)(6) to authorize \nrelief from a final judgment only in similarly \n\u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d that are not otherwise \nspecifically covered by the Rule, Ackermann, 340 U.S. \nat 199.  The Court has emphasized that stringent \nrequirement time and again in an unbroken line of \ndecisions.  See Kemp v. United States, 596 U.S. 528, \n533 (2022); Tharpe v. Sellers, 583 U.S. 33, 35 (2018) \n(per curiam); Buck v. Davis, 580 U.S. 100, 123 (2017); \nChristeson v. Roper, 574 U.S. 373, 380 (2015) (per \ncuriam); Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 535; Agostini v.

United States, 335 U.S. 601, \n613-14 (1949).   \n\n24 \n \n\u201cThis very strict interpretation of Rule 60(b) is \nessential if the finality of judgments is to be \npreserved.\u201d  Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 535 (quoting \nLiljeberg, \n486 \nU.S. \nat \n873 \n(Rehnquist, \nC.J., \ndissenting)).  And this Court has left no room for Rule \n15\u2019s liberal amendment policy to creep into the \nequation.  For good reason:  Rule 60(b) is carefully \ncrafted to provide a mechanism only for those rare \n\u201csituations in which relief must be obtained after \njudgment,\u201d and \u201cthe broad amendment policy of Rule \n15(a) should not be construed in a manner that would \nrender [that] provision[] meaningless.\u201d  6 Wright & \nMiller, Federal Practice & Procedure \u00a7 1489 (3d ed. \n2024).  \u201cTo hold otherwise would enable the liberal \namendment policy of Rule 15(a) to be employed in a \nway that is contrary to the philosophy favoring finality \nof judgments and the expeditious termination of \nlitigation\u201d that the Rules were designed to promote.  \nTool Box, Inc. v. Ogden City Corp., 419 F.3d 1084, 1087 \n(10th Cir. 2005) (quoting 6 Wright & Miller, Federal \nPractice & Procedure \u00a7 1489 (2d ed. 1990)); see Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 1. \nThis understanding is also consistent with Rule \n15(a)\u2019s text, history, and structure.  By its terms, Rule \n15(a) provides a liberal repleading policy only \u201cbefore \ntrial.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a) (capitalization altered).  Up \nuntil that point in the litigation, courts \u201cshould freely \ngive leave\u201d to amend a complaint \u201cwhen justice so \nrequires.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2).  This policy \nfacilitates having claims \u201cdecided on [their] merits \nrather than on procedural technicalities.\u201d  6 Wright & \nMiller, supra, \u00a7 1471 (3d ed.).   \n\n25 \n \nBut that liberal pre-trial policy evaporates post-\njudgment.  After all, \u201ca trial court\u2019s final judgment \n\u2018resolves conclusively the substance of all claims, \nrights, and liabilities of all parties to an action\u2019 and \n\u2018ends the litigation on the merits\u2019 in the district court.\u201d  \nBoyd v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corrs., 114 F.4th 1232, 1237 \n(11th Cir. 2024) (citation omitted).  \u201cSo once the court \nhas entered final judgment, Rule 15(a) no longer \napplies and no amendment is possible unless the \njudgment is first set aside.\u201d  Id.  And, where the \nplaintiff seeks vacatur through Rule 60(b)(6), \n\u201cextraordinary circumstances must justify reopening.\u201d  \nKemp, 596 U.S. at 533 (quotation marks omitted).  \nOnly after making that threshold showing to vacate \nthe judgment may the plaintiff seek leave to amend \nunder Rule 15(a)\u2019s standard.  \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s contrary rule breaks from this \nCourt\u2019s precedents, the history and structure of the \nFederal Rules, and every one of its sister Circuits.  It \nabandons the \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d standard \nin favor of a nebulous \u201cbalanc[ing]\u201d inquiry that pits \nRule 60(b)(6)\u2019s protection of \u201cfinality\u201d against \u201cRule \n15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policies.\u201d  Pet.App.8.  And \nit loads the dice in that balancing test against finality, \nproviding that district courts necessarily abuse their \ndiscretion by \u201cdenying post-judgment relief\u201d based on \nthe movant\u2019s \u201cfailure to demonstrate adequate \ngrounds for relief under Rule 60.\u201d  Mandala, 88 F.4th \nat 362 & n.5. \nNot only does that defy this Court\u2019s precedent, but \nit also violates the cardinal principle that \u201c[c]ourts are \nrequired to give effect to Congress\u2019 express inclusions \nand exclusions, not disregard them.\u201d  Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of \n\n26 \n \nMfrs. v. Dep\u2019t of Def., 583 U.S. 109, 126 (2018).  In Rule \n15(a)(2), Congress adopted this Court\u2019s instruction to \n\u201cfreely give leave\u201d to amend before trial.  Fed. R. Civ. \nP. \n15(a)(2). \n \nBut \nCongress \nand \nthis \nCourt \nconspicuously chose not to do the same in Rule 60(b) \nwhen delineating the \u201cgrounds for relief from a final \njudgment.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) (capitalization \naltered).  The implication from that differing language \nis thus straightforward.  When a plaintiff seeks to \n\u201creopen a final judgment,\u201d as here, \u201cthe policy favoring \nthe finality of judgments [is] implicated,\u201d and \u201c[t]he \npermissive policy favoring amendment under Rule 15 \n[is] simply not relevant.\u201d  Garrett v. Wexford Health, \n938 F.3d 69, 86 (3d Cir. 2019) (emphasis added).  \nIndeed, \u201cthere is no pending complaint to amend\u201d once \n\u201cthe action has been dismissed\u201d with prejudice.  \nCalvary Christian Ctr. v. City of Fredericksburg, 710 \nF.3d 536, 540 (4th Cir. 2013); see also, e.g., Pe\u00f1a v. \nMattox, 84 F.3d 894, 903 (7th Cir. 1996); Fisher v. \nKadant, Inc., 589 F.3d 505, 509 (1st Cir. 2009).  The \nmatter is closed, the claim is \u201cextinguishe[d],\u201d and res \njudicata generally \u201cbar[s] a subsequent action on that \nclaim.\u201d  Cooper v. Fed. Rsrv. Bank of Richmond, 467 \nU.S. 867, 874 (1984). \nAs a result, the \u201cmore restrictive standard\u201d for \ngranting a Rule 60(b) motion \u201cmust be satisfied before \nconsideration can be given to a motion to amend.\u201d  \nDaulatzai, 97 F.4th at 179 (emphasis added).  \nOtherwise, as now-Chief Judge Sutton has explained, \nplaintiffs could \u201csidestep the narrow grounds for \nobtaining post-judgment relief\u201d under Rule 60(b), \n\u201cmake the finality of judgments an interim concept,\u201d \nand risk turning Rule 60(b) into a \u201cnullit[y].\u201d  Leisure \nCaviar, LLC v. U.S. Fish & Wildlife Serv., 616 F.3d \n\n27 \n \n612, 616 (6th Cir. 2010).  There is no good reason for \n\u201cjudgment finality\u201d to be so \u201clightly cast aside.\u201d  United \nStates v. Denedo, 556 U.S. 904, 916 (2009).   \nB. Rule 60(b)(6) Provides No Basis for Relief \nfrom a Party\u2019s Free, Calculated Choices. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s rebuke of the \u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d test suffers from another shortcoming.  \nIt \ndefies \nthe \nrequirement \nthat \nthe \nalleged \n\u201c\u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019\u201d be such \u201cthat the \n[moving] party is faultless in the delay.\u201d  Pioneer Inv. \nServs., 507 U.S. at 393 (citation omitted); see \nAckermann, 340 U.S. at 198.  Put another way:  The \nmovant must be \u201ccompletely without fault for his or \nher predicament\u201d and \u201cunable to have taken any steps \nthat would have resulted in preventing the judgment \nfrom which relief is sought.\u201d  12 James Wm. Moore et \nal., Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00a7 60.48[3][b] (3d ed. \n2024).  A party that is even \u201cpartly to blame for the \ndelay\u201d cannot obtain relief under Rule 60(b)(6).  \nPioneer Inv. Servs., 507 U.S. at 393. \nThat requirement fits neatly within the broader \ncontext of Rule 60(b).  After all, Rule 60(b)(6) \u201cis \navailable only when Rules 60(b)(1) through (b)(5) are \ninapplicable.\u201d  Kemp, 596 U.S. at 533.  That narrow, \nresidual role for the catchall clause respects the plain \nmeaning of its \u201c\u2018other reason\u2019 language\u201d and \n\u201cprevent[s] clause (6) from being used to circumvent \nthe 1-year limitations period\u201d that applies to clauses \n(1) through (3).  Liljeberg, 486 U.S. at 863 n.11; see \nFed. R. Civ. P. 60(c)(1).  One of those time-limited \ncircumstances is for \u201cexcusable neglect.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 60(b)(1).  Thus, \u201ca party who failed to take timely \naction due to \u2018excusable neglect\u2019 may not seek relief \n\n28 \n \nmore than a year after the judgment by resorting to \nsubsection (6).\u201d  Pioneer Inv. Servs., 507 U.S. at 393.  \nIf it could, then the \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d provision and \nits limitations would become \u201csuperfluous\u201d and \n\u201cinsignificant.\u201d  TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U.S. 19, 31 \n(2001) (citation omitted).  Such an interpretation \u201cis of \ncourse to be avoided.\u201d  Dastar Corp. v. Twentieth \nCentury Fox Film Corp., 539 U.S. 23, 35 (2003). \nSo too is any interpretation that would excuse a \nparty\u2019s voluntary waiver of a court\u2019s invitation to \namend.  The \u201cusual federal rule of waiver\u201d applies \nregardless of \u201cprejudice\u201d to the party that \u201cknowingly \nrelinquish[ed]\u201d his rights.  Morgan v. Sundance, Inc., \n596 U.S. 411, 417-19 (2022).  And this Court has made \nclear that \u201c[i]t would be \u2018an abuse of discretion\u2019\u201d to \n\u201c\u2018override a [party\u2019s] deliberative waiver.\u2019\u201d  Wood v. \nMilyard, 566 U.S. 463, 472-73 (2012) (quoting Day v. \nMcDonough, 547 U.S. 198, 202 (2006)). \nRule 60(b)(6) is no exception.  As this Court held \nlong ago, parties \u201ccannot be relieved of [their] \nchoice[s]\u201d through that mechanism simply \u201cbecause \nhindsight seems to indicate\u201d the improvidence of their \ndecisions.  Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 198.  A party\u2019s \nwaiver of the right to amend in the normal course\u2014\nlike Respondents\u2019 repeated waivers here\u2014thus cannot \njustify relief from the entry of a final judgment that \nresults from that party\u2019s \u201cconsidered choice.\u201d  Id. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s tortured approach violates \nthese basic principles of waiver.  By requiring district \ncourts to consider Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberality policy in \ntandem with Rule 60\u2019s regard for finality\u2014even when \nthe movant has consistently and consciously rejected \nnumerous invitations and opportunities to amend\u2014\n\n29 \n \nthe Second Circuit has directed district courts to \noverride and rescue parties from their \u201cfree, \ncalculated, [and] deliberate choices.\u201d  Id.  That is \nprecisely the sort of unfair and inefficient relitigation \nloop that this Court has repeatedly warned against.  \n\u201cThere must be an end to litigation someday,\u201d and a \nlitigant\u2019s strategic choices \u201care not to be relieved \nfrom.\u201d  Id. \nC. The Second Circuit\u2019s Outlier Balancing \nTest Is Untenable. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s approach cannot be squared \nwith any of this.  The decision below held that \nRespondents \nneed \nnot \nshow \n\u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d to reopen the final judgment entered \nagainst \nthem \nbecause, \nin \nits \nview, \n\u201cspecial \nconsiderations come into play\u201d when \u201cvacatur is \nsought in order to obtain leave to file an amended \ncomplaint.\u201d  Pet.App.7 (quoting Mandala, 88 F.4th at \n361).  But the court failed to root these supposedly \nspecial considerations in text, context, or precedent.  \nAnd it contradicted each of those sources of legal \nauthority along the way. \n1. The Second Circuit\u2019s Test Is Atextual. \nMost notably, the Second Circuit\u2019s balancing test is \nunmoored from the text of the Federal Rules.  This \nCourt interprets the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \nas it would any statute.  See Bus. Guides, Inc. v. \nChromatic Commc\u2019ns Enters., Inc., 498 U.S. 533, 540-\n41 (1991).  Its analysis in that interpretive enterprise \nalways \u201cbegins with the text.\u201d  Ross v. Blake, 578 U.S. \n632, 638 (2016).  Here, however, the Second Circuit \n\n30 \n \n\u201cmade no attempt to ground its analysis\u201d in the actual \nlanguage of Rule 60(b)(6).  Id. \nNor could it.  Nothing in that Rule\u2019s text compels \ndistricts courts to give \u201c\u2018due regard\u2019 to \u2018the liberal \nspirit of Rule 15\u2019\u201d after final judgment \u201cby ensuring \nplaintiffs at least one opportunity to replead.\u201d  \nMandala, 88 F.4th at 362 (quoting Metzler Inv. GmbH \nv. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., 970 F.3d 133, 146 (2d \nCir. 2020)).  Nothing in the Federal Rules\u2019 text allows \nplaintiffs to leapfrog over \u201cRule 60(b)\u2019s finality \ngauntlet\u201d to the sanctuary of \u201cRule 15(a)\u2019s liberal \nrepleading policy.\u201d  Pet.App.8.  And nothing in the text \ncalls for any exceptions to Rule 60(b)\u2019s demanding \nstandards for \u201cRelief from a Final Judgment.\u201d  Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 60(b). \nMeanwhile, the text of Rule 15(a) expressly \nindicates that it has no role to play after judgment.  \nInstead, it applies only to \u201cAmendments Before Trial.\u201d  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 15(a); see Krupski v. Costa Crociere S. p. \nA., 560 U.S. 538, 553 (2010).  It is in that setting\u2014\nbefore trial and a final judgment\u2014that the Rules \nencourage courts to \u201cfreely give leave\u201d to amend, so \nthat the relevant factual allegations and legal issues \ncan be joined and presented at trial.  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n15(a)(2).  By contrast, Rule 15(a) does not provide any \nmechanism for amending pleadings after dismissal, \nfinal judgment, and affirmance on appeal.  At that \npoint, there are no pending pleadings to amend.  And \nalterations of the final judgment are the province of \nRule 60(b). \nThe Second Circuit thus failed to heed the plain \ntext of both Rule 15(a) and Rule 60(b) when fashioning \nits balancing test.  That led it to fault the District \n\n31 \n \nCourt for evaluating Plaintiffs\u2019 Rule 60(b) motion \n\u201cunder only Rule 60(b)\u2019s standard.\u201d  Pet.App.7.  But \nthat is exactly what the District Court was supposed \nto do.  \u201cPlaintiffs must first meet the threshold \nrequirement of 60(b)(6)\u2019s extraordinary or exceptional \ncircumstances to vacate the judgment before seeking\u201d \nto amend their pleadings.  In re Ferro Corp. Deriv. \nLitig., 511 F.3d 611, 624 (6th Cir. 2008).  The structure \nand plain text of the Federal Rules both make clear \nthat failure to meet that burden forecloses relief. \n2. The Second Circuit\u2019s Test Conflicts \nwith Other Provisions of Rule 60. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s test makes even less sense \nwhen assessed within the \u201ctotal context\u201d of Rule 60.  \nPavelic & LeFlore v. Marvel Ent. Grp., 493 U.S. 120, \n123 (1989).  A Rule 60(b) motion to reopen \u201cmust be \nmade within a reasonable time\u2014and for reasons (1), \n(2), and (3) no more than a year after the entry of the \njudgment.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(c)(1).  Yet the Second \nCircuit\u2019s balancing test for Rule 60(b)(6) enables \nlitigants to evade those explicit time limitations in at \nleast three ways. \nFirst, the Second Circuit\u2019s liberal repleading policy \npermits litigants to bypass Rule 60\u2019s strict time \nlimitations for \u201cexcusable neglect.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n60(b)(1).  If a plaintiff neglects to include certain \nallegations in his complaint and that omission is \n\u201cexcusable,\u201d then he has only one year to move to \nreopen the judgment based on that oversight through \nRule 60(b)(1).  He cannot do the same through Rule \n60(b)(6), as a party cannot \u201c\u2018avail himself\u2019\u201d of that \nprovision \u201cif his motion is based on grounds specified \nin clause (1).\u201d  Liljeberg, 486 U.S. at 863 n.11 (citation \n\n32 \n \nomitted).  But the Second Circuit allows and even \nencourages plaintiffs to do precisely that, by \ncompelling district courts to reopen actions under Rule \n60(b)(6) if the plaintiffs \u201creasonably\u201d (i.e., excusably) \nneglected to include their late-breaking allegations \nbefore final judgment.  Mandala, 88 F.4th at 359, 364.4  \nRather than embrace that misguided approach, this \nCourt \nshould \n\u201cresist\u201d \nany \ninterpretation \nthat \n\u201crender[s] [Rule 60(b)] so internally inconsistent.\u201d  \nJones v. Hendrix, 599 U.S. 465, 479 (2023) (citation \nomitted). \nSecond, the Second Circuit\u2019s balancing test serves \nas an end-run around Rule 60(b)(1)\u2019s time limits for \n\u201cmistake.\u201d  In Mandala, for instance, the Court of \nAppeals held that Rule 60(b)(1) is \u201cinapplicable\u201d\u2014and \nthat \u201c\u2018the liberal spirit of Rule 15\u2019\u201d instead kicks in\u2014\nwhen a \u201cvacatur motion arises from a legal mistake\u201d \nthat leads a plaintiff into \u201cinsufficient pleading.\u201d  88 \nF.4th at 360-62 (emphasis added; citation omitted).  \nYet, there is no reason why that form of \u201clegal mistake\u201d \nwould pull a motion outside of Rule 60(b)(1)\u2019s ambit.  \nThose who drafted and adopted the Rules \u201cchose to \ninclude \u2018mistake\u2019 unqualified.\u201d  Kemp, 596 U.S. at 534.  \n\u201cWhen the Rule was adopted in 1938 and revised in \n \n4  Of course, if a plaintiff \u201cinexcusably\u201d omitted their new \nallegations, that cannot possibly provide a \u201creason that justifies \nrelief.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6) (emphasis added); see, e.g., \nInexcusable, American College Dictionary 621 (Clarence L. \nBarnhart ed., 1953) (\u201cincapable of being justified\u201d); Inexcusable, \nWebster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary 428 (6th ed. 1949) (\u201cnot \nadmitting excuse or justification\u201d).  It is therefore \u201cclear\u201d that \n\u201cinexcusable neglect\u201d similarly \u201cdoes not justify relief under Rule \n60(b)(6).\u201d  Helm v. Resolution Tr. Corp., 84 F.3d 874, 879 (7th Cir. \n1996); see Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 202; PIRS Cap., LLC v. \nWilliams, 54 F.4th 1050, 1055 (8th Cir. 2022). \n\n33 \n \n1946, \nthe \nword \n\u2018mistake\u2019 \napplied \nto \nany \n\u2018misconception,\u2019 \u2018misunderstanding,\u2019 or \u2018fault in \nopinion or judgment.\u2019\u201d  Id. (quoting Webster\u2019s New \nInternational Dictionary 1383 (1914)).  That includes \n\u201cmistakes of law\u201d made by judges and litigants alike.  \nId. at 534-35.  The Second Circuit\u2019s atextual standard \nthus clashes with Rule 60\u2019s limited availability of \nrelief for \u201cmistake\u201d as well.  That provides yet another \ncontextual strike against it. \nThird, the Second Circuit\u2019s approach overrides \nRule 60(b)(2)\u2019s restrictions for vacatur based on new \nevidence.  That provision allows parties \u201cto reopen \nproceedings\u201d based only \u201con matter which could not \nreasonably have been previously adduced\u201d\u2014and even \nthen, only if the party presents that material within a \nyear of final judgment.  INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314, \n326 (1992); see Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(2) (\u201cnewly \ndiscovered evidence that, with reasonable diligence, \ncould not have been discovered in time to move for a \nnew trial\u201d).  This rule is consistent with centuries of \nhistorical \npractice. \n \nSee, \ne.g., \nJoseph \nStory, \nCommentaries on Equity Pleadings 322 (2d ed. 1840) \n(explaining that a final judgment can be reopened \nbased only on \u201csome new matter, which hath arisen in \ntime after the decree, and not on any new proof, which \nmight have been used, when the decree was made\u201d \n(discussing the Ordinances in Chancery of Lord \nChancellor Bacon)); Purcell v. Miner, 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) \n519, 521 (1867) (same).  But, under the Second \nCircuit\u2019s regime, movants can introduce new factual \nallegations through Rule 60(b)(6), even if they could \nhave presented them before, and even if more than a \nyear has elapsed from the entry of final judgment.  See \nMandala, 88 F.4th at 365.  In this way, too, the Second \n\n34 \n \nCircuit has put Rule 60 \u201cat war with itself.\u201d  United \nStates ex rel. Polansky v. Exec. Health Res., Inc., 599 \nU.S. 419, 434 (2023) (citation omitted).  \n3. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s Test Distorts this \nCourt\u2019s Precedents. \nLeft with no support in Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s text or \ncontext, the Second Circuit tried to ground its \nstandard in Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178.  See \nMandala, 88 F.4th at 362; Pet.App.6.  But Foman did \nnot address a Rule 60(b)(6) motion.  This Court instead \nrecognized the motion there (which was filed just a day \nafter the district court\u2019s decision) \u201cas one under Rule \n59(e).\u201d  Foman, 371 U.S. at 179, 181 (emphasis added). \nAs a result, Foman is simply inapt in this setting. \nRather, the controlling precedent is Gonzalez, which \nreaffirmed that a Rule 60(b)(6) motion \u201crequires a \nshowing of \u2018extraordinary circumstances.\u2019\u201d  545 U.S. at \n536.  And there is no basis to conflate that demanding \nstandard with the one for Rule 59(e).  \u201cThe difference \nbetween the two rules . . . is material, both in scope \nand purpose, and, by their own terms, different \nstandards apply.\u201d  Daulatzai, 97 F.4th at 177. \nIndeed, \u201cRule 60(b) differs from Rule 59(e) in just \nabout every way that matters to the inquiry here.\u201d  \nBanister, 590 U.S. at 518; see Daulatzai, 97 F.4th at \n177-78.  A Rule 59(e) motion \u201cis a one-time effort to \nbring alleged errors in a just-issued decision to a \n[district] court\u2019s attention, before taking a single \nappeal.\u201d  Banister, 590 U.S. at 521; see Fed. R. Civ. P. \n59(e).  Accordingly, the time for bringing a Rule 59(e) \nmotion \u201cis short\u201428 days from entry of the judgment, \nwith no possibility of an extension.\u201d  Banister, 590 U.S. \nat 507-08.  And, because \u201c[i]t is a limited continuation \n\n35 \n \nof the original proceeding,\u201d a timely Rule 59(e) motion \nautomatically \n\u201c\u2018suspend[s] \nthe \nfinality\u2019 \nof \nany \njudgment.\u201d  Id. at 514, 521 (citation omitted); see Fed. \nR. App. P. 4(a)(4)(A)(iv).  \u201cOnly the disposition of that \nmotion restores the finality of the original judgment,\u201d \nand \nthat \ndisposition \n\u201cmerges \nwith \nthe \nprior \ndetermination, so that the reviewing court takes up \nonly one judgment\u201d on appeal.  Banister, 590 U.S. at \n508-09 (brackets and quotation marks omitted).  By \ncontrast, \u201c[a] Rule 60(b) motion\u2014often distant in time \nand scope and always giving rise to a separate \nappeal\u2014attacks an already completed judgment,\u201d and \nit \u201c\u2018does not affect the [original] judgment\u2019s finality or \nsuspend its operation.\u201d  Id. at 520-21 (second \nalteration in original) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(c)(2)).  \nA Rule 60(b) motion therefore uniquely \u201cthreaten[s] an \nalready final judgment with successive litigation.\u201d  Id. \nat 519.  Consequently, the \u201cstandard for granting a \nRule 59(e) motion\u201d is more \u201cbroad and open ended\u201d \nthan Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s strict standard for relief.  \nDaulatzai, 97 F.4th at 177.   \nThe Second Circuit failed to grasp these crucial \ndifferences.  Instead, Mandala and the decision below \nwrongly treated Rule 59(e) and Rule 60(b)(6) motions \nas fungible, and then uncritically transplanted \nFoman\u2019s more forgiving Rule 59(e) standard to \noverride the stringent requirements for Rule 60(b)(6).  \nThis Court should reject that misguided approach.  It \ndisregards Rule 60(b)\u2019s unique text and context and \nflouts this Court\u2019s Rule 60(b) precedents. \n\n36 \n \n4. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s Test Undermines \nthe Guiding Principles of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure. \nEven if there were any doubt (which there is not), \nthe Federal Rules would require this Court to resolve \nit against the Second Circuit\u2019s interpretation.  That is \nbecause the Rules state that they must be \u201cconstrued\u201d \nin the face of ambiguity to \u201csecure the just, speedy, and \ninexpensive determination of every action and \nproceeding.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 1.   \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s approach flips those guiding \nprinciples on their head.  It eschews finality, and it \nundermines confidence in the outcome of hard-fought \nlitigation.  It also enables plaintiffs to \u201cuse the court \nas a sounding board to discover holes in their \narguments, then \u2018reopen the case by amending their \ncomplaint to take account of the court\u2019s decision,\u2019\u201d even \nafter testing the complaint against a full appeal and \nrepeatedly declining earlier opportunities to amend.  \nLeisure Caviar, 616 F.3d at 616 (quoting James v. \nWatt, 716 F.2d 71, 78 (1st Cir. 1983) (Breyer, J.)).  Such \ngamesmanship will inevitably draw out litigation and \ndrive up its already high costs.   \nThis case proves the point.  The matter \u201chas been \nclosed since January 15, 2020,\u201d when Petitioner \nsecured a final judgment in its favor.  Pet.App.10.  \nPetitioner prevailed on appeal after that.  Then \nPetitioner successfully showed that Rule 60(b) \nprovided no path for reopening the final judgment.  \nRespondents\u2019 \u201cfail[ure] to satisfy the requirements of \nRule 60(b) should therefore have ended the matter.\u201d  \nDaulatzai, 97 F.4th at 179.  Yet, Respondents continue \nto seek a return to square one\u2014merely so that they \n\n37 \n \ncan plead new factual allegations that were previously \navailable to them and which they had expressly \ndeclined to plead before dismissal. \nAllowing losing litigants to thus restart the loop of \nlitigation would not promote the \u201cspeedy\u201d and \n\u201cinexpensive\u201d resolution of claims.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 1.  \nNor would it be \u201cjust.\u201d  Id.  Quite the opposite:  Like \nthe doctrine of res judicata, Rule 60(b)\u2019s demanding \nrequirements for reopening a final judgment are \nthemselves rooted in \u201cfundamental and substantial \njustice,\u201d and they are designed to further both \u201c\u2018public \npolicy and . . . private peace.\u2019\u201d  Federated Dep\u2019t Stores, \nInc. v. Moitie, 452 U.S. 394, 401 (1981) (citation \nomitted); see supra Section I.A.  They should therefore \n\u201cbe cordially regarded and enforced by the courts.\u201d  \nMoitie, 452 U.S. at 401 (citation omitted).  The \n\u201cweighty interests in finality\u201d must \u201ctrump the \ninterest in giving losing litigants access to an \nadditional\u201d round of proceedings in all but the most \nunusual case.  See San Remo Hotel, L.P. v. City & \nCounty of S.F., 545 U.S. 323, 345 (2005).  That is \nparticularly true when the movant seeks a mulligan to \nrescue himself from his \u201cfree, calculated, deliberate \nchoices.\u201d  Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 198.   \nConsistent with these fundamental tenets of civil \nprocedure, courts have long rejected belated attempts \nby plaintiffs to attack a final judgment with an \namended complaint.  See supra note 3 (collecting \ncases).  They have instead required plaintiffs to put \ntheir best foot forward before judgment or risk an end \nto their lawsuit.  And they have reserved Rule 60(b)(6) \nrelief\u2014as this Court\u2019s precedents command\u2014for only \n\n38 \n \ntruly \u201ccompelling circumstances\u201d outside the movant\u2019s \ncontrol.  James, 716 F.2d at 78 (Breyer, J.). \n*   *   * \nIn sum, Rule 15(a) \u201cgoverns amendment of \npleadings before judgment is entered; it has no \napplication after judgment is entered.\u201d  Jacobs v. \nTempur-Pedic Int\u2019l Inc., 626 F.3d 1327, 1344 (11th Cir. \n2010).  From that point, a party that seeks \u201crelief from \na final judgment\u201d must first satisfy the rigorous \ndemands of Rule 60(b).  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) \n(capitalization altered).5  And where, as here, the \nparty seeks such relief under Rule 60(b)(6), he must \n\u201cshow \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019\u201d beyond his \ncontrol that would \u201cjustify[] the reopening of a final \njudgment.\u201d  Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 535 (quoting \nAckermann, 340 U.S. at 199); see Pioneer Inv. Servs., \n507 U.S. at 393.  Only after surmounting that \nintentionally high hurdle for vacating the judgment \ncan he invoke the more liberal policies of Rule 15(a).  \nThe Second Circuit erred in holding to the contrary. \nII. Respondents Cannot Satisfy Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s \nStringent Standard. \nThis Court should reverse the decision below and \nbring an end to this litigation once and for all.  Unlike \nthe Second Circuit, the District Court applied the \ncorrect legal standard by refusing to \u201c\u2018entertain a \nmotion to amend the complaint\u2019 under Rule 15(a) \nwithout \u2018a valid basis to vacate the previously entered \njudgment\u2019 under Rule 60(b).\u201d  Pet.App.7 (quoting \nDistrict Court\u2019s decision).  It properly treated those \n \n5  Or those of Rule 59(e), if the motion is filed within 28 days \nof the entry of judgment. \n\n39 \n \nRules as posing two distinct inquiries.  And, in a \nthoughtful \nopinion \nissued \nafter \na \npre-motion \nconference and full briefing, it methodically explained \nwhy Respondents \u201chave not demonstrated any \nextraordinary circumstances warranting relief under \nRule 60(b)(6).\u201d  Pet.App.14. \nA. Respondents Have Not Demonstrated \n\u201cExtraordinary Circumstances.\u201d \nWhen a District Court applies the correct legal \nstandard, as here, \u201cRule 60(b) proceedings are subject \nto only limited and deferential appellate review.\u201d  \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. at 535.  An appellate court \u201cmay \nreview the [district court\u2019s] ruling only for abuse of \ndiscretion.\u201d  Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corrs. of Ill., 434 \nU.S. 257, 263 n.7 (1978).  And that standard affords \u201ca \nwide range of choice\u201d to the district court.  McLane Co. \nv. EEOC, 581 U.S. 72, 83 (2017) (citation omitted).  \nAppellate courts cannot \u201cinterfere with the District \nCourt\u2019s exercise of discretion unless\u201d they are left with \n\u201ca definite and firm conviction that the court \ncommitted a clear error of judgment.\u201d  Betterbox \nCommc\u2019ns, Ltd. v. BB Techs, Inc., 300 F.3d 325, 332 \n(3d Cir. 2002) (Alito, J.) (alterations adopted; citation \nomitted).  In other words, the Court must \u201cfind a \ncomplete absence of a reasonable basis and [be] \ncertain that the [District Court\u2019s] decision is wrong.\u201d  \nDavis v. Kan. Dep\u2019t of Corrs., 507 F.3d 1246, 1248 (10th \nCir. 2007) (citation omitted). \nThat is not the case here.  Far from it.  Respondents \nhave never contended \u201cthat any of their proposed new \nallegations were unavailable to them\u201d when they filed \ntheir complaint or when they repeatedly declined the \nDistrict Court\u2019s invitations to amend.  Pet.App.15.  \n\n40 \n \nThey argue only that the Second Circuit \u201cclarified\u201d the \nJASTA pleading standard in some respects in their \nprevious appeal of the District Court\u2019s dismissal.  \nBIO.2.  But that is neither correct nor relevant.   \nIt is not correct because the Second Circuit \naffirmed the dismissal on grounds that the District \nCourt had relied on\u2014namely, that Respondents\u2019 \n\u201callegations do not support an inference that BLOM \nBank was aware of the Three Customers\u2019 ties with \nHamas prior to the relevant attacks.\u201d  Pet.App.49; see \nalso Pet.App.74-75 (\u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 allegations therefore \nfail to raise above the speculative level the specter that \nBLOM was aware of a connection between the Three \nCustomers and Hamas at the time it provided \nfinancial services to the Three Customers.\u201d).  In dicta, \nthe Second Circuit disagreed with other grounds relied \non by the District Court.  But the District Court\u2019s \nindependent conclusion that Respondents failed to \ndemonstrate general awareness at the time of the \nalleged assistance\u2014as JASTA requires\u2014\u201cremain[s] \ncompletely unaffected by anything that was decided or \nsaid\u201d by the Second Circuit in this case or any other.  \nPolites v. United States, 364 U.S. 426, 436 (1960) \n(affirming denial of Rule 60(b) motion).   \nRespondents\u2019 argument is also irrelevant because, \neven if the Second Circuit had clarified its view of the \nlaw, that would not be enough to satisfy Rule 60(b)(6).  \n\u201cIntervening developments in the law by themselves \nrarely\u201d \nif \never \n\u201cconstitute \nthe \nextraordinary \ncircumstances required for relief under Rule 60(b)(6).\u201d  \nAgostini, 521 U.S. at 239; see Pet.App.14-15.  And the \ndevelopments here are by no means groundbreaking.  \nThe governing statute did not change after final \n\n41 \n \njudgment. \n \nRespondents \nmerely \nallege \na \n\u201cclarification[]\u201d of the law by the Second Circuit that \nwas in line with their own interpretation.  BIO.25.  \nThere \nis \nnothing \n\u201cextraordinary\u201d \nabout \nthat.  \nRespondents never \u201cexplain[ed] why they did not \nallege facts sufficient to satisfy the standard for which \nthey were advocating.\u201d  Pet.App.17 n.5.  And clarifying \nthe law is what appellate courts do all the time.  In \nfact, this Court has held that even a \u201cchange in the \nlaw\u201d worked by one of its decisions abrogating \npreviously controlling circuit precedent could not \njustify Rule 60(b)(6) relief.  Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 536-\n37 (emphasis added).  Such a change in decisional \ncaselaw, \nthe \nCourt \nexplained, \nis \n\u201chardly \nextraordinary.\u201d  Id. at 536.  The circumstances here \nare even less so.  \nIn short, the District Court\u2019s determination that \nRespondents failed to satisfy Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s high bar \nfor reopening a final judgment fell well within the \nrange of permissible decisions.  It was not an abuse of \ndiscretion.  It should have been upheld for that reason \nalone. \nB. Respondents Waived or Forfeited Multiple \nOpportunities to Amend Their Complaint. \nNot only did the District Court act within its \ndiscretion, but it would have abused its discretion had \nit ruled the other way.  As this Court has explained, it \nis \u201can abuse of discretion\u201d to \u201coverride a [party\u2019s] \ndeliberative waiver.\u201d  Wood, 566 U.S. at 472-73 \n(citation omitted).  And this case involves waiver many \ntimes over.  Respondents \u201cdo not contend that the \nadditional facts they now propose to allege were not \navailable\u201d to them before, and they \u201cconcede that they \n\n42 \n \ntwice declined the opportunity to amend their \nComplaint before th[e] [District] Court dismissed it.\u201d  \nPet.App.16, 18 n.6.  The District Court rightly held \nthat those repeated waivers foreclosed relief as well.  \nSee Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 198.   \nRespondents first rejected the District Court\u2019s \ninvitation to amend at the pre-motion conference.  \nPet.App.16-17.  Before that conference, Petitioner \nexplained that \u201cthe Complaint alleges nothing more \nthan that [Petitioner] provided routine banking \nservices to organizations that later were revealed to be \nconnected to Hamas.\u201d  JA.145.  \u201c[N]one of the \nallegations, if true, would establish that [Petitioner] \nwas aware of that connection at the time it provided \nthose banking services\u201d to the Three Customers.  Id.  \nAccordingly, the District Court asked Respondents\u2019 \ncounsel if there were \u201cany additional facts [they] could \nadd to the allegations\u201d to address Petitioner\u2019s \narguments.  Pet.App.93.  Respondents\u2019 counsel \n\u201cexpressly declined\u201d the invitation.  Pet.App.17.  The \nDistrict Court then asked a second time if \nRespondents \u201cwould not want to amend\u201d if the Court \n\u201cwere to grant [Petitioner\u2019s] motion.\u201d  Pet.App.93.  \nRespondents unequivocally stated that they \u201cwould \nnot seek leave to amend.\u201d  Pet.App.94.  Hence, the \nDistrict Court issued a minute entry and scheduling \norder to that effect.  JA.156. \nNotwithstanding that entry, the District Court \ngave Respondents yet another chance to amend at oral \nargument \non \nPetitioner\u2019s \nmotion \nto \ndismiss.  \nPet.App.17-18.  At the hearing, the judge explained \nthat she \u201cjust [did not] see any knowledge on the part \nof [Petitioner]\u201d alleged in the complaint.  Pet.App.118.  \n\n43 \n \nShe asked if \u201ceverything [she] need[ed] to consider in \nterms of sufficiency of [the] pleading is going to be \nfound in the complaint that\u2019s filed in this case.\u201d  \nPet.App.124.  And she asked Respondents to confirm \nthat \u201c[t]here are no facts that [Respondents] would \nhave to offer to address some of the contentions of \n[Petitioner] \nregarding \nknowledge, \nespecially.\u201d  \nPet.App.125.  In response, Respondents \u201cagain \nexpressly declined the opportunity to amend their \ncomplaint\u201d and chose to proceed on their complaint as \npled.  Pet.App.18.  That was a \u201ccalculated and \ndeliberate\u201d choice.  Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 198.  Rule \n60(b)(6) therefore \u201chas no application.\u201d  Id. at 202. \nNor did Respondents\u2019 waivers stop there.  Despite \nproceeding up to the Second Circuit, Respondents \n\u201cnever appealed the \u2018with prejudice\u2019 aspect of the \ndismissal\u201d and never argued that the District Court \nshould \nhave \ngranted \nthem \nleave \nto \nreplead.  \nPet.App.16 n.4.  They simply maintained that their \nallegations were sufficient.  The District Court \ncorrectly recognized this litigation choice as still \nanother waiver that precluded Respondents from \nseeking leave to replead if they lost on appeal.  See id. \n(citing 18A Wright & Miller, Federal Practice & \nProcedure \u00a7 4433 (3d ed. 2021) (\u201cA party who elects to \nappeal on one issue, omitting another issue on which \nit lost, is subject to issue preclusion on the issue not \nappealed.\u201d)).   \nThat failure was by itself fatal, even ignoring \nRespondents\u2019 previous waivers.  If a party\u2019s \u201creason \nasserted for [its] Rule 60(b)(6) motion could have been \naddressed on appeal from the judgment,\u201d then the \nmotion must be denied \u201cas merely an inappropriate \n\n44 \n \nsubstitute for an appeal.\u201d  Aikens v. Ingram, 652 F.3d \n496, 501 (4th Cir. 2011) (en banc).  This understanding \nthat Rule 60(b)(6) \u201ccannot be used as a substitute for \nappeal\u201d has been \u201csettled\u201d for decades.  Jean F. \nRydstrom, Construction and Application of Rule \n60(b)(6) of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 15 A.L.R. \nFed. 193, \u00a7 2[a] (2024).  And that principle makes \neminent sense.  Otherwise, parties could skirt the \nlimitations period for post-judgment motions based on \n\u201cmistake, \ninadvertence, \nsurprise, \nor \nexcusable \nneglect,\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1), as well as the \njurisdictional time limits for appealing an adverse \ndecision, see Fed. R. App. P. 4(a); Bowles v. Russell, 551 \nU.S. 205, 206 (2007). \nEach of the foregoing waivers demonstrates that \nRespondents were not \u201cfaultless in the delay.\u201d  Pioneer \nInv. Servs., 507 U.S. at 393.  That delay resulted from \ntheir own strategic decisions, each of which precludes \nrelief.  And, beyond those waivers, Respondents \nforfeited still more opportunities to seek amendment \nof their complaint.  In particular, before failing to \nappeal from the District Court\u2019s \u201cwith prejudice\u201d \nruling, they failed to file a Rule 59(e) motion \nchallenging that aspect of the District Court\u2019s \ndismissal.  And despite being invited to file \nsupplemental briefing in the Second Circuit\u2014after \nthat court issued its controlling decision in Kaplan\u2014\nRespondents still failed to request leave to amend in \nlight of that new precedent.   \nRespondents have thus come nowhere close to \nmeeting Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d \nstandard.  Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 536.  In fact, they \ncould not even satisfy Foman\u2019s more lenient standard \n\n45 \n \nfor Rule 59(e) motions.  Foman held only that a district \ncourt \nerrs \nby \n\u201coutright \nrefus[ing]\u201d \nto \npermit \namendment before appeal \u201cwithout any justifying \nreason.\u201d  371 U.S. at 182.  Here, by contrast, the \nDistrict Court provided many justifying reasons for \ndenying relief (after appellate proceedings had \nalready concluded).  It explained that Respondents \n\u201chad ample opportunity to pursue all legal avenues \navailable to them for relief,\u201d but they simply chose not \nto do so.  Pet.App.16.  They instead engaged in a \n\u201cdocumented series of deliberate choices not to cure \nthe deficiencies identified in their pleading by \n[Petitioner] and [the District] Court.\u201d  Pet.App.19.  \nThose \u201cfree, calculated, deliberate choices are not to be \nrelieved from.\u201d  Id. (quoting Ackermann, 340 U.S. at \n198).  Not only was the District Court\u2019s decision a \npermissible exercise of discretion, but it was \ndemonstrably correct. \n \n \n\n46 \n \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should reverse \nthe judgment below. \n  \n \n \n \n  Respectfully submitted, \nJONATHAN R.

Circuit courts generally hold that \nmeans providing an opportunity to amend once a ruling \nidentifies remediable defects, if any, in a pleading. Fail-\ning to provide that opportunity may constitute an \u201cex-\ntraordinary circumstance\u201d and a basis to vacate a judg-\nment under Rule 60(b)(6).  \nHere, the Second Circuit found that the district \ncourt dismissed Respondents\u2019 complaint by applying \nthe \u201cwrong legal standard\u201d for pleading an aiding and \nabetting claim (in the Second Circuit) under the Justice \nAgainst Sponsors of Terrorism Act, as well as a stand-\nard for pleading knowledge that was \u201ctoo exacting\u201d and \nall but impossible to meet by amendment. The circuit \ncourt provided clarified pleading standards and identi-\nfied specific, remediable defects in the complaint. Re-\nspondents then promptly moved to vacate the district \ncourt\u2019s judgment in order to meet those clarified stand-\nards in an amended complaint\u2014their first in this litiga-\ntion. The district court refused and, after Respondents \nappealed again, the circuit issued a non-precedential \nsummary order remanding the case for \u201crecon-\nsider[ation].\u201d \nThe question presented is thus whether the circuit \ncourt erred in directing the district court to reconsider \nits refusal to grant Respondents an opportunity to meet \nthe pleading standards the circuit corrected in the prior \nappeal. \n \n \n\nii \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \nQUESTION PRESENTED ............................................. i \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES ......................................... iv \nINTRODUCTION .......................................................... 1 \nSTATEMENT ................................................................ 4 \nI. \nThe Complaint and Pre-Motion Conference for \nBLOM\u2019s Motion to Dismiss .............................. 4 \nII. \nThe Motion to Dismiss ..................................... 7 \nIII.

The dis-\ntrict court had denied vacatur because Plaintiffs de-\nclined its pre-dismissal invitations to amend their \ncomplaint\u2014but the circuit court found the district \ncourt was applying the \u201cwrong\u201d pleading standards, \nPet.App.5, which were so overly \u201cexacting\u201d that Plain-\ntiffs could not meet them before discovery, Pet.App.49.  \nPetitioner (\u201cBLOM\u201d) argues that by making this \nstraightforward remand, the Second Circuit has effec-\ntively \u201cabandon[ed] the \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 \nstandard in favor of a nebulous \u2018balanc[ing]\u2019 inquiry \nthat pits Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s protection of \u2018finality\u2019 against \n\u2018Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policies.\u2019\u201d Pet.Br.25 \n(quoting Pet.App.8). In BLOM\u2019s telling, the Second \nCircuit has \u201cjettisoned\u201d Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s guardrails, \nPet.Br.14., and motions for post-judgment amend-\nments will now be all but rubber-stamped in the cir-\ncuit. This is incorrect. \nFirst of all, this conclusion is not supported by the \nspare language of the summary order, which simply \ndirects the district court to \u201creconsider\u201d denying vaca-\ntur given Second Circuit and Supreme Court prece-\ndents. Nothing has been \u201cabandoned\u201d\u2014consistent \nwith decisions from this Court, \u201c[r]elief under Rule \n60(b)(6)\u201d in the Second Circuit \u201cis reserved for cases \nthat present \u2018extraordinary circumstances,\u2019\u201d including \nwhere a party seeks post-judgment amendment. Man-\ndala v. NTT Data, Inc., 88 F.4th 353, 361 (2d Cir. 2023) \n(citation omitted). Indeed, the standards the Second \n\n \n \n \n \n \n2 \n \nCircuit has \u201cdeveloped\u201d\u2014and reaffirmed by the sum-\nmary order below\u2014\u201cfor evaluating postjudgment mo-\ntions generally place significant emphasis on the \n\u2018value of finality and repose.\u2019\u201d Williams v. Citigroup \nInc., 659 F.3d 208, 213 (2d Cir. 2011) (citation omit-\nted). \nSecond, balancing finality and justice is not \u201cnebu-\nlous,\u201d as BLOM calls it, but rather inherent to Rule \n60(b)(6) jurisprudence: The rule\u2019s \u201cextraordinary cir-\ncumstances\u201d requirement \u201cexists in order to balance \nthe broad language of Rule 60(b)(6), which allows \ncourts to set aside judgments for \u2018any\u2019 reason justify-\ning relief, with the interest in the finality of judg-\nments.\u201d Budget Blinds, Inc. v. White, 536 F.3d 244, \n255 (3d Cir. 2008). When considering a motion to \namend a complaint, finality interests are \u201cbalance[d] \n. . . with the preference expressed in the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure in general, and Rule 15 in particu-\nlar, for resolving disputes on their merits.\u201d Krupski v. \nCosta Crociere S. p. A., 560 U.S. 538, 550 (2010).  \nThird, this case does involve truly \u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d because (1) the district court dismissed \nthe complaint using a set of \u201cwrong legal standards,\u201d \nincluding the nearly impossible requirement of alleg-\ning, without the opportunity for any discovery, \u201cacts or \nstatements\u201d of \u201cBLOM employees\u201d to demonstrate the \nbank\u2019s knowledge; (2) the circuit court rejected those \nstandards on appeal\u2014including the direct evidence re-\nquirement\u2014and \u201cclarified\u201d the correct ones; (3) the cir-\ncuit court found that Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations were none-\ntheless too \u201climited\u201d to meet the clarified standards, \ndrawing a newly announced distinction between \nPlaintiffs\u2019 \u201cpublicly available\u201d evidence and \u201cpublic \nsources such as media articles,\u201d Pet.App.50 & n.18; (4) \nthe circuit court identified several remediable defects \n\n \n \n \n \n \n3 \n \nin the complaint that the district court had not, such \nas clarifying that cash withdrawals are untraceable \nand alleging the degree to which Israeli terrorism des-\nignations were publicized; and (5) Plaintiffs had not \nyet amended their complaint even once. In these one-\nof-a-kind circumstances, the Rules\u2019 strong preference \nfor deciding cases on their merits entitles Plaintiffs to \nhave at least one opportunity to cure those defects. \nBLOM\u2019s argument is therefore premised on con-\nstruing the case\u2019s procedural history to suggest the \nSecond Circuit found that Plaintiffs \u201cwaived\u201d their \nright to amend post-judgment but nevertheless \u201cdi-\nrected district courts to override and rescue parties \nfrom their \u2018free, calculated, [and] deliberate choices,\u2019\u201d \nsuch as \u201cwhen the movant has consistently and con-\nsciously rejected numerous invitations and opportuni-\nties to amend.\u201d Pet.Br.28-29 (citations omitted).  \nBut the Second Circuit never accepted BLOM\u2019s \n\u201cwaiver\u201d argument. To the contrary, it recognized that \nPlaintiffs did not have a meaningful opportunity to \namend at all because \u201cthe district court applied the \nwrong legal standard for aiding-and-abetting liability \nunder JASTA,\u201d Pet.App.5, and a standard for pleading \nknowledge that was \u201ctoo exacting,\u201d Pet.App.49. In fact, \nthe district court\u2019s knowledge pleading standard was \nunmeetable\u2014as Circuit Court Judge Wesley noted in \nresponse to BLOM\u2019s insistence at oral argument that \nPlaintiffs waived opportunities to amend: \u201cWhat are \nthey supposed to do? They know they can\u2019t amend [to] \n. . . meet that.\u201d Oral Arg. at 11:52-:56, Honickman, No. \n22-1039 (2d Cir. Oct. 5, 2023), https://ww3.ca2. \nuscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/6a33dfa3-27c7-4b0a-\n82ee-86c41553c09a/1/doc/22-1039.mp3. \nIgnoring this, BLOM further insists that \u201cthe Sec-\nond Circuit affirmed the dismissal on grounds that the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n4 \n \nDistrict Court had relied on,\u201d Pet.Br. 40\u2014but the dis-\ntrict court itself acknowledged that the decision was \naffirmed \u201con other grounds.\u201d Pet.App.10. Most im-\nportantly, BLOM\u2019s reading of the record is irrelevant \nto the question presented\u2014the summary order below \nwas not premised on any such finding and thus did not \ndirect district courts to \u201coverride\u201d waivers.  \nThe unusual procedural history of this case makes \nclear that no meaningful opportunities to satisfy the \ncorrect legal standards were available to Plaintiffs and \ntherefore the remand to the district court was not a \ndeparture from Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s long-recognized stand-\nards. Rather, in the Second Circuit parties who de-\nclined meaningful invitations \u201care not entitled to relief \nfrom the judgment.\u201d Metzler Inv. GmbH v. Chipotle \nMexican Grill, Inc., 970 F.3d 133, 148 (2d Cir. 2020).  \nThis is not unusual\u2014the circuits broadly require \ndistrict courts to provide at least one opportunity to \namend, often after dismissal when the complaint\u2019s re-\nmediable defects, if any, are correctly identified by a \ncourt ruling. Refusing leave to amend after dismissal \nis thus often an abuse of discretion\u2014the result is no \ndifferent here, except that Plaintiffs were compelled to \nappeal the district court\u2019s erroneous decision first. \nSTATEMENT \nI. \nThe Complaint and Pre-Motion Conference \nfor BLOM\u2019s Motion to Dismiss \nPlaintiffs filed their complaint on January 1, 2019, \nasserting claims under the Anti-Terrorism Act \n(\u201cATA\u201d), as amended by the Justice Against Sponsors \nof Terrorism Act (\u201cJASTA\u201d), and alleging that BLOM \naided and abetted a series of terrorist attacks commit-\nted by the Palestinian foreign terrorist organization \n(\u201cFTO\u201d) Hamas (or \u201cHAMAS\u201d) that injured Plaintiffs. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n5 \n \nSpecifically, Plaintiffs alleged that BLOM knowingly \nprovided substantial assistance to three Hamas fund-\nraisers (the \u201cThree Customers\u201d), including the pur-\nported charitable institution Sanabil, which the \nUnited States designated a Specially Designated \nGlobal Terrorist (\u201cSDGT\u201d) in 2003. Relying in part on \nfinancial records disclosed during the criminal trial of \nthe Holy Land Foundation (\u201cHLF,\u201d a notorious Hamas \nfundraiser) in Texas, Plaintiffs alleged that BLOM as-\nsisted the Three Customers in converting millions of \ndollars of donations from HLF and other Hamas sup-\nporters abroad into cash (notwithstanding BLOM\u2019s de-\nscription of its services as \u201croutine,\u201d Pet.Br.5-6), which \nthey used, inter alia, to recruit Palestinians living in \nLebanon to join and support Hamas before and during \nthe \u201cSecond Intifada,\u201d when the acts of terrorism at is-\nsue here occurred.  \nPlaintiffs alleged BLOM\u2019s knowledge by \u201crefer-\nences to media articles and publications on the Three \nCustomers\u2019 connection to Hamas.\u201d Pet.App.49. Plain-\ntiffs also alleged that Sanabil\u2019s board included contem-\nporaneous Hamas leaders in Lebanon. JA.105, 114. \nPlaintiffs alleged that Israel designated another one of \nthe Three Customers, the Union of Good, as \u201cpart of \nthe Hamas organization\u201d in 2002, during the relevant \nperiod (1998-2004, JA.82). JA.118. The Union of \nGood\u2019s infamous leader, Sheikh Qaradawi, regularly \nappeared on television during that period extolling the \nvirtues of suicide bombings against Israel. JA.120.  \nPlaintiffs also alleged that BLOM converted mil-\nlions of dollars for the Three Customers from not only \nHLF, but also from its successor KindHearts after the \nUnited States designated HLF an SDGT in 2001, \nJA.99-100, 106-13, 117, and from Al Aqsa Foundation \nafter Israel designated it a Hamas entity and its \n\n \n \n \n \n \n6 \n \nheadquarters were shuttered by the German govern-\nment\u2014and one transaction after the United States \ndesignated it an SDGT. JA.95-96, 113.  \nOn May 3, 2019, BLOM filed a letter requesting a \npre-motion conference to initiate a motion to dismiss \nthe complaint for failure to state a claim, setting forth \na summary of its anticipated arguments. JA.142-47. \nThese arguments, which the district court later \nadopted in dismissing the complaint, were incon-\nsistent with JASTA\u2019s plain language, the interpreta-\ntive guidance in Halberstam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472 \n(D.C. Cir. 1983)\u2014which Congress set as the legal \nframework for JASTA\u2014and the Second Circuit\u2019s then-\nonly prior JASTA ruling in Linde v. Arab Bank, PLC, \n882 F.3d 314 (2d Cir. 2018).  \nPlaintiffs provided a summary of their anticipated \nopposition in a letter on May 8, 2019. JA.148-55. Spe-\ncifically, Plaintiffs relied on the standards from both \nLinde and Halberstam and noted that foreseeability \nwas the key factor in assessing a defendant\u2019s wrongful \nconduct under JASTA. As shown below, the district \ncourt ultimately adopted BLOM\u2019s arguments and re-\njected foreseeability. See Pet.App.71-72. The Second \nCircuit subsequently vindicated Plaintiffs\u2019 analysis, as \ndid this Court four years later. See Twitter, Inc. v. \nTaamneh, 598 U.S. 471, 496 (2023).  \nThe district court held a pre-motion conference on \nMay 15, 2019. After raising sua sponte whether BLOM \nhad an affirmative defense based on the statute of lim-\nitations, Pet.App.91, the court then stated:  \nI am just wondering if it might be prudent to \nallow the plaintiffs to amend their complaint, \nnot to add more claims, not to add more parties, \nbut rather to factually support some of the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n7 \n \nclaims that [defense counsel] have identified as \nbeing deficient regarding the standards that \nwere adopted by [Linde] from [Halberstam]. \n[Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel], do you want that oppor-\ntunity?  \nPet.App.93. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel responded, \u201cNo, I think \nwe are prepared to brief it based on the arguments pre-\nsented in [our] pre-motion letter.\u201d Id. This position was \nappropriate given that Plaintiffs\u2019 readings of Linde \nand Halberstam were substantively correct, whereas \nBLOM\u2019s contrary positions were not. \nFollowing the pre-motion conference, the district \ncourt issued a Minute Entry and Scheduling Order \nnoting: \u201cThe Court offered Plaintiffs an opportunity to \namend their complaint to add additional information \nin response to the arguments raised by Defendant. \nPlaintiffs declined . . . to amend their Complaint in \nthis regard.\u201d JA.156 (emphasis added). That is, the \ndistrict court offered Plaintiffs the opportunity to meet \nBLOM\u2019s urged legal standards, which they reasonably \ndeclined\u2014as shown by the circuit\u2019s later \u201cclarification\u201d \nof the applicable standards. \nII. \nThe Motion to Dis\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n20: 20250108172209078_No.2023-125920Osen20LLC20COS.json (score: 0.399)\nE-Mail Address: 1115 H Street, NE.\nfae Driefs@wilsonepes.com Washington, D.C. 20002\n\nWeb Site: \u2018Tal (202) 789.0096\nwo \u2018wor wilsonepes.com Fax (202) 842-4896\nNo. 28-1259\nBLOM BANK SAL\nPetitioner,\n\nMICHAL HONICKMAN, ET AL.\nRespondents.\n\nAFFIDAVIT OF SERVICE\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that on January 8, 2025, three (9) copies of the BRIEF FOR\nRESPONDENTS in the abovecaptioned case were served, as required by US.

Circuit courts generally hold that \nmeans providing an opportunity to amend once a ruling \nidentifies remediable defects, if any, in a pleading. Fail-\ning to provide that opportunity may constitute an \u201cex-\ntraordinary circumstance\u201d and a basis to vacate a judg-\nment under Rule 60(b)(6).  \nHere, the Second Circuit found that the district \ncourt dismissed Respondents\u2019 complaint by applying \nthe \u201cwrong legal standard\u201d for pleading an aiding and \nabetting claim (in the Second Circuit) under the Justice \nAgainst Sponsors of Terrorism Act, as well as a stand-\nard for pleading knowledge that was \u201ctoo exacting\u201d and \nall but impossible to meet by amendment. The circuit \ncourt provided clarified pleading standards and identi-\nfied specific, remediable defects in the complaint. Re-\nspondents then promptly moved to vacate the district \ncourt\u2019s judgment in order to meet those clarified stand-\nards in an amended complaint\u2014their first in this litiga-\ntion. The district court refused and, after Respondents \nappealed again, the circuit issued a non-precedential \nsummary order remanding the case for \u201crecon-\nsider[ation].\u201d \nThe question presented is thus whether the circuit \ncourt erred in directing the district court to reconsider \nits refusal to grant Respondents an opportunity to meet \nthe pleading standards the circuit corrected in the prior \nappeal. \n \n \n\nii \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \nQUESTION PRESENTED ............................................. i \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES ......................................... iv \nINTRODUCTION .......................................................... 1 \nSTATEMENT ................................................................ 4 \nI. \nThe Complaint and Pre-Motion Conference for \nBLOM\u2019s Motion to Dismiss .............................. 4 \nII. \nThe Motion to Dismiss ..................................... 7 \nIII.

The dis-\ntrict court had denied vacatur because Plaintiffs de-\nclined its pre-dismissal invitations to amend their \ncomplaint\u2014but the circuit court found the district \ncourt was applying the \u201cwrong\u201d pleading standards, \nPet.App.5, which were so overly \u201cexacting\u201d that Plain-\ntiffs could not meet them before discovery, Pet.App.49.  \nPetitioner (\u201cBLOM\u201d) argues that by making this \nstraightforward remand, the Second Circuit has effec-\ntively \u201cabandon[ed] the \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 \nstandard in favor of a nebulous \u2018balanc[ing]\u2019 inquiry \nthat pits Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s protection of \u2018finality\u2019 against \n\u2018Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policies.\u2019\u201d Pet.Br.25 \n(quoting Pet.App.8). In BLOM\u2019s telling, the Second \nCircuit has \u201cjettisoned\u201d Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s guardrails, \nPet.Br.14., and motions for post-judgment amend-\nments will now be all but rubber-stamped in the cir-\ncuit. This is incorrect. \nFirst of all, this conclusion is not supported by the \nspare language of the summary order, which simply \ndirects the district court to \u201creconsider\u201d denying vaca-\ntur given Second Circuit and Supreme Court prece-\ndents. Nothing has been \u201cabandoned\u201d\u2014consistent \nwith decisions from this Court, \u201c[r]elief under Rule \n60(b)(6)\u201d in the Second Circuit \u201cis reserved for cases \nthat present \u2018extraordinary circumstances,\u2019\u201d including \nwhere a party seeks post-judgment amendment. Man-\ndala v. NTT Data, Inc., 88 F.4th 353, 361 (2d Cir. 2023) \n(citation omitted). Indeed, the standards the Second \n\n \n \n \n \n \n2 \n \nCircuit has \u201cdeveloped\u201d\u2014and reaffirmed by the sum-\nmary order below\u2014\u201cfor evaluating postjudgment mo-\ntions generally place significant emphasis on the \n\u2018value of finality and repose.\u2019\u201d Williams v. Citigroup \nInc., 659 F.3d 208, 213 (2d Cir. 2011) (citation omit-\nted). \nSecond, balancing finality and justice is not \u201cnebu-\nlous,\u201d as BLOM calls it, but rather inherent to Rule \n60(b)(6) jurisprudence: The rule\u2019s \u201cextraordinary cir-\ncumstances\u201d requirement \u201cexists in order to balance \nthe broad language of Rule 60(b)(6), which allows \ncourts to set aside judgments for \u2018any\u2019 reason justify-\ning relief, with the interest in the finality of judg-\nments.\u201d Budget Blinds, Inc. v. White, 536 F.3d 244, \n255 (3d Cir. 2008). When considering a motion to \namend a complaint, finality interests are \u201cbalance[d] \n. . . with the preference expressed in the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure in general, and Rule 15 in particu-\nlar, for resolving disputes on their merits.\u201d Krupski v. \nCosta Crociere S. p. A., 560 U.S. 538, 550 (2010).  \nThird, this case does involve truly \u201cextraordinary \ncircumstances\u201d because (1) the district court dismissed \nthe complaint using a set of \u201cwrong legal standards,\u201d \nincluding the nearly impossible requirement of alleg-\ning, without the opportunity for any discovery, \u201cacts or \nstatements\u201d of \u201cBLOM employees\u201d to demonstrate the \nbank\u2019s knowledge; (2) the circuit court rejected those \nstandards on appeal\u2014including the direct evidence re-\nquirement\u2014and \u201cclarified\u201d the correct ones; (3) the cir-\ncuit court found that Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations were none-\ntheless too \u201climited\u201d to meet the clarified standards, \ndrawing a newly announced distinction between \nPlaintiffs\u2019 \u201cpublicly available\u201d evidence and \u201cpublic \nsources such as media articles,\u201d Pet.App.50 & n.18; (4) \nthe circuit court identified several remediable defects \n\n \n \n \n \n \n3 \n \nin the complaint that the district court had not, such \nas clarifying that cash withdrawals are untraceable \nand alleging the degree to which Israeli terrorism des-\nignations were publicized; and (5) Plaintiffs had not \nyet amended their complaint even once. In these one-\nof-a-kind circumstances, the Rules\u2019 strong preference \nfor deciding cases on their merits entitles Plaintiffs to \nhave at least one opportunity to cure those defects. \nBLOM\u2019s argument is therefore premised on con-\nstruing the case\u2019s procedural history to suggest the \nSecond Circuit found that Plaintiffs \u201cwaived\u201d their \nright to amend post-judgment but nevertheless \u201cdi-\nrected district courts to override and rescue parties \nfrom their \u2018free, calculated, [and] deliberate choices,\u2019\u201d \nsuch as \u201cwhen the movant has consistently and con-\nsciously rejected numerous invitations and opportuni-\nties to amend.\u201d Pet.Br.28-29 (citations omitted).  \nBut the Second Circuit never accepted BLOM\u2019s \n\u201cwaiver\u201d argument. To the contrary, it recognized that \nPlaintiffs did not have a meaningful opportunity to \namend at all because \u201cthe district court applied the \nwrong legal standard for aiding-and-abetting liability \nunder JASTA,\u201d Pet.App.5, and a standard for pleading \nknowledge that was \u201ctoo exacting,\u201d Pet.App.49. In fact, \nthe district court\u2019s knowledge pleading standard was \nunmeetable\u2014as Circuit Court Judge Wesley noted in \nresponse to BLOM\u2019s insistence at oral argument that \nPlaintiffs waived opportunities to amend: \u201cWhat are \nthey supposed to do? They know they can\u2019t amend [to] \n. . . meet that.\u201d Oral Arg. at 11:52-:56, Honickman, No. \n22-1039 (2d Cir. Oct. 5, 2023), https://ww3.ca2. \nuscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/6a33dfa3-27c7-4b0a-\n82ee-86c41553c09a/1/doc/22-1039.mp3. \nIgnoring this, BLOM further insists that \u201cthe Sec-\nond Circuit affirmed the dismissal on grounds that the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n4 \n \nDistrict Court had relied on,\u201d Pet.Br. 40\u2014but the dis-\ntrict court itself acknowledged that the decision was \naffirmed \u201con other grounds.\u201d Pet.App.10. Most im-\nportantly, BLOM\u2019s reading of the record is irrelevant \nto the question presented\u2014the summary order below \nwas not premised on any such finding and thus did not \ndirect district courts to \u201coverride\u201d waivers.  \nThe unusual procedural history of this case makes \nclear that no meaningful opportunities to satisfy the \ncorrect legal standards were available to Plaintiffs and \ntherefore the remand to the district court was not a \ndeparture from Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s long-recognized stand-\nards. Rather, in the Second Circuit parties who de-\nclined meaningful invitations \u201care not entitled to relief \nfrom the judgment.\u201d Metzler Inv. GmbH v. Chipotle \nMexican Grill, Inc., 970 F.3d 133, 148 (2d Cir. 2020).  \nThis is not unusual\u2014the circuits broadly require \ndistrict courts to provide at least one opportunity to \namend, often after dismissal when the complaint\u2019s re-\nmediable defects, if any, are correctly identified by a \ncourt ruling. Refusing leave to amend after dismissal \nis thus often an abuse of discretion\u2014the result is no \ndifferent here, except that Plaintiffs were compelled to \nappeal the district court\u2019s erroneous decision first. \nSTATEMENT \nI. \nThe Complaint and Pre-Motion Conference \nfor BLOM\u2019s Motion to Dismiss \nPlaintiffs filed their complaint on January 1, 2019, \nasserting claims under the Anti-Terrorism Act \n(\u201cATA\u201d), as amended by the Justice Against Sponsors \nof Terrorism Act (\u201cJASTA\u201d), and alleging that BLOM \naided and abetted a series of terrorist attacks commit-\nted by the Palestinian foreign terrorist organization \n(\u201cFTO\u201d) Hamas (or \u201cHAMAS\u201d) that injured Plaintiffs. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n5 \n \nSpecifically, Plaintiffs alleged that BLOM knowingly \nprovided substantial assistance to three Hamas fund-\nraisers (the \u201cThree Customers\u201d), including the pur-\nported charitable institution Sanabil, which the \nUnited States designated a Specially Designated \nGlobal Terrorist (\u201cSDGT\u201d) in 2003. Relying in part on \nfinancial records disclosed during the criminal trial of \nthe Holy Land Foundation (\u201cHLF,\u201d a notorious Hamas \nfundraiser) in Texas, Plaintiffs alleged that BLOM as-\nsisted the Three Customers in converting millions of \ndollars of donations from HLF and other Hamas sup-\nporters abroad into cash (notwithstanding BLOM\u2019s de-\nscription of its services as \u201croutine,\u201d Pet.Br.5-6), which \nthey used, inter alia, to recruit Palestinians living in \nLebanon to join and support Hamas before and during \nthe \u201cSecond Intifada,\u201d when the acts of terrorism at is-\nsue here occurred.  \nPlaintiffs alleged BLOM\u2019s knowledge by \u201crefer-\nences to media articles and publications on the Three \nCustomers\u2019 connection to Hamas.\u201d Pet.App.49. Plain-\ntiffs also alleged that Sanabil\u2019s board included contem-\nporaneous Hamas leaders in Lebanon. JA.105, 114. \nPlaintiffs alleged that Israel designated another one of \nthe Three Customers, the Union of Good, as \u201cpart of \nthe Hamas organization\u201d in 2002, during the relevant \nperiod (1998-2004, JA.82). JA.118. The Union of \nGood\u2019s infamous leader, Sheikh Qaradawi, regularly \nappeared on television during that period extolling the \nvirtues of suicide bombings against Israel. JA.120.  \nPlaintiffs also alleged that BLOM converted mil-\nlions of dollars for the Three Customers from not only \nHLF, but also from its successor KindHearts after the \nUnited States designated HLF an SDGT in 2001, \nJA.99-100, 106-13, 117, and from Al Aqsa Foundation \nafter Israel designated it a Hamas entity and its \n\n \n \n \n \n \n6 \n \nheadquarters were shuttered by the German govern-\nment\u2014and one transaction after the United States \ndesignated it an SDGT. JA.95-96, 113.  \nOn May 3, 2019, BLOM filed a letter requesting a \npre-motion conference to initiate a motion to dismiss \nthe complaint for failure to state a claim, setting forth \na summary of its anticipated arguments. JA.142-47. \nThese arguments, which the district court later \nadopted in dismissing the complaint, were incon-\nsistent with JASTA\u2019s plain language, the interpreta-\ntive guidance in Halberstam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472 \n(D.C. Cir. 1983)\u2014which Congress set as the legal \nframework for JASTA\u2014and the Second Circuit\u2019s then-\nonly prior JASTA ruling in Linde v. Arab Bank, PLC, \n882 F.3d 314 (2d Cir. 2018).  \nPlaintiffs provided a summary of their anticipated \nopposition in a letter on May 8, 2019. JA.148-55. Spe-\ncifically, Plaintiffs relied on the standards from both \nLinde and Halberstam and noted that foreseeability \nwas the key factor in assessing a defendant\u2019s wrongful \nconduct under JASTA. As shown below, the district \ncourt ultimately adopted BLOM\u2019s arguments and re-\njected foreseeability. See Pet.App.71-72. The Second \nCircuit subsequently vindicated Plaintiffs\u2019 analysis, as \ndid this Court four years later. See Twitter, Inc. v. \nTaamneh, 598 U.S. 471, 496 (2023).  \nThe district court held a pre-motion conference on \nMay 15, 2019. After raising sua sponte whether BLOM \nhad an affirmative defense based on the statute of lim-\nitations, Pet.App.91, the court then stated:  \nI am just wondering if it might be prudent to \nallow the plaintiffs to amend their complaint, \nnot to add more claims, not to add more parties, \nbut rather to factually support some of the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n7 \n \nclaims that [defense counsel] have identified as \nbeing deficient regarding the standards that \nwere adopted by [Linde] from [Halberstam]. \n[Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel], do you want that oppor-\ntunity?  \nPet.App.93. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel responded, \u201cNo, I think \nwe are prepared to brief it based on the arguments pre-\nsented in [our] pre-motion letter.\u201d Id. This position was \nappropriate given that Plaintiffs\u2019 readings of Linde \nand Halberstam were substantively correct, whereas \nBLOM\u2019s contrary positions were not. \nFollowing the pre-motion conference, the district \ncourt issued a Minute Entry and Scheduling Order \nnoting: \u201cThe Court offered Plaintiffs an opportunity to \namend their complaint to add additional information \nin response to the arguments raised by Defendant. \nPlaintiffs declined . . . to amend their Complaint in \nthis regard.\u201d JA.156 (emphasis added). That is, the \ndistrict court offered Plaintiffs the opportunity to meet \nBLOM\u2019s urged legal standards, which they reasonably \ndeclined\u2014as shown by the circuit\u2019s later \u201cclarification\u201d \nof the applicable standards. \nII. \nThe Motion to Dismiss \nThe parties then briefed the motion to dismiss, in \nwhich they presented arguments largely consistent \nwith the summaries set forth in their pre-motion let-\nters.  \nDuring oral argument on the motion to dismiss, \nBLOM\u2019s counsel relied heavily on a district court deci-\nsion, Kaplan v. Lebanese Canadian Bank, SAL, 405 F. \nSupp. 3d 525 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (\u201cKaplan I\u201d), vac\u2019d in rel-\nevant part, 999 F.3d 842 (2d Cir. 2021) (\u201cKaplan II\u201d). \nKaplan I dismissed JASTA claims against Lebanese \nCanadian Bank (\u201cLCB\u201d), premised on allegations that \n\n \n \n \n \n \n8 \n \nLCB provided financial services for the terrorist group \nHezbollah. As BLOM pointed out, BLOM allegedly \nprovided financial services for Hamas fundraisers in \nLebanon much as LCB did for entities controlled by \nHezbollah. Pet.App.131. \nBLOM urged the district court to adopt Kaplan I\u2019s \nerroneous pleading standards\u2014including its unwork-\nable standard for pleading scienter. Under that stand-\nard, the Kaplan I district court held that public state-\nments and media reports tying five of LCB\u2019s customers \nto Hezbollah could not support an inference of LCB\u2019s \nknowledge of those ties because \u201cPlaintiffs nowhere al-\nlege . . . that Defendant read or was aware of such \nsources.\u201d 405 F. Supp. 3d at 535. Naturally, before dis-\ncovery, a plaintiff will rarely be able to find support for \nwhat sources a defendant has actually \u201cread\u201d or was \naware of. See Pet.App.50 n.18 (\u201cpublic sources\u201d can \n\u201cplausibly suggest a defendant\u2019s knowledge which can \nbe confirmed during discovery\u201d) (emphasis added).  \nNonetheless, BLOM\u2019s counsel argued: \nFinally, I wanted to point out that the level of \nknowledge that Judge Daniels rejected in \nKaplan [I] was very much what\u2019s claimed here, \nwhere it said that it was notorious that there \nwere links between the accounts at issue there, \nbetween those persons and in that case, Hezbol-\nlah. And that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s said here. It was \napparently notorious that BLOM should have \nknown that these accounts were linked to HA-\nMAS, but there\u2019s no direct allegation of why \nBLOM should have known that.  \nPet.App.131. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel disagreed, arguing \n\u201cKaplan [I] requires a level of proof that is out of step \n\n \n \n \n \n \n9 \n \nwith JASTA, out of step with Linde and would be im-\npossible to meet.\u201d Pet.App.126.  \nDuring the oral argument, the district court again \nasked: \u201cThere are no facts that you would have to offer \nto address some of the contentions of the defendants \nregarding knowledge, especially?\u201d Pet.App.125 (em-\nphasis added). But these \u201ccontentions\u201d premised on \nKaplan I were impossible to meet on amendment\u2014\nPlaintiffs possessed no evidence that any BLOM em-\nployee \u201cread or was aware of\u201d any specific piece of in-\nformation. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel explained that while \nthey \u201ccould always add allegations, . . . the complaint \ngoes far enough in saying that BLOM holding accounts \nfor Specially Designated Global Terrorists designated \nfor . . . financing HAMAS, was generally aware of its \nrole in that [il]licit conduct, and . . . the violence that \nresulted from it was foreseeable\u201d as set forth in Linde. \nId. \nIII. \nThe District Court\u2019s Decision on the Motion \nto Dismiss and First Appeal \nThe district court granted BLOM\u2019s motion to dis-\nmiss on January 14, 2020 (\u201cHonickman I\u201d), largely on \nthe grounds BLOM raised, including\u2014as BLOM \nurged\u2014by relying heavily on Kaplan I. The district \ncourt called Kaplan I \u201ca more appropriate comparison\u201d \nand \u201ca more appropriate point of reference\u201d than other \nJASTA and ATA cases to which Plaintiffs analogized \ntheir complaint. Pet.App.77, 84.  \nFor example, and of particular importance to the \nquestion presented here, the district court adopted \nKaplan I\u2019s \u201cread-or-was-aware-of\u201d standard for plead-\ning knowledge. The district court explained that in \nKaplan I, \n\n \n \n \n \n \n10 \n \nalthough the plaintiffs argued that the entities\u2019 \nconnections to Hizbollah \u201cwas [sic] openly, pub-\nlicly and repeatedly acknowledged and publi-\ncized by Hizbollah [through its own sources]\u201d \nand \u201cin various English-language publications,\u201d \nthe plaintiffs \u201cnowhere allege[d] . . . that [LCB] \nread or was aware of such sources.\u201d The same \nanalysis applies even more strongly here, given \nthe relatively greater strength of the allegations \nin Kaplan [I]. \nPet.App.79 (quoting Kaplan I, 405 F. Supp. 3d at 535) \n(emphasis added). Having adopted this position, the \ndistrict court then faulted Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint for \nlacking allegations citing \u201cacts or statements by \nBLOM or BLOM\u2019s employees\u201d regarding its customers\u2019 \naffiliations with Hamas, instead relying on \u201cpress ar-\nticles, government actions, and allegedly \u2018public \nknowledge\u2019 discussing\u201d such connections. Pet.App.73-\n74.  \nUnsurprisingly, financial institutions do not often \npublicly admit their knowledge of their roles in assist-\ning terrorism. Therefore, moving to amend after dis-\nmissal in this case\u2014or accepting the district court\u2019s in-\nvitations to amend, such as during oral argument \nwhere BLOM demanded \u201cdirect allegation[s]\u201d of its \nknowledge, Pet.App.131\u2014would have been pointless. \nAnd while the Second Circuit also ultimately found \nPlaintiffs\u2019 allegations of BLOM\u2019s knowledge of the \nThree Customers\u2019 Hamas affiliations insufficient, it \ndid so for reasons that could be remedied by replead-\ning\u2014such as by pleading more allegations of (1) \u201cpub-\nlic sources\u201d demonstrating that Israeli terrorism des-\nignations were made public, (2) banks\u2019 policies for \nmonitoring counterparties, and (3) the untraceable na-\nture of cash. None of those grounds required alleging \n\n \n \n \n \n \n11 \n \nBLOM\u2019s internal communications or deliberations at \nthe pleading stage showing that BLOM \u201cread or was \naware\u201d of such sources.  \nPlaintiffs timely appealed the district court\u2019s dis-\nmissal decision. Because Kaplan I was also on appeal, \nthe Second Circuit held Honickman in abeyance and \ndirected the parties to submit supplemental briefs on \nthe \u201cissue of how [Kaplan] applies to this case,\u201d once \ndecided. JA.257-258. The circuit subsequently issued \nKaplan II, vacating Kaplan I\u2019s dismissal of JASTA aid-\ning and abetting claims against LCB. See 999 F.3d \n842. Kaplan II largely clarified the standards for \nJASTA liability, as Plaintiffs explained in their sup-\nplemental brief. JA.259-281. BLOM, however, argued \nthat Kaplan II somehow \u201cunderscore[d] the soundness \nof the District Court\u2019s legal analysis,\u201d despite vacating \nits primary support\u2014Kaplan I. JA.294. The circuit \nthen issued its first decision in Honickman on July 29, \n2021 (\u201cHonickman II\u201d). \nIV. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s Assessment of the Dis-\ntrict Court\u2019s Dismissal Decision  \nThe Second Circuit \u201cagree[d]\u201d with Plaintiffs \u201cthat \nthe [district] court did not apply the proper standard \n. . . .\u201d Pet.App.24. Specifically, the circuit rejected \nevery standard the district court applied as grounds \nfor dismissal, including the direct-evidence standard \nfor alleging BLOM\u2019s knowledge of the Three Custom-\ners\u2019 affiliations with Hamas. It also rejected the dis-\ntrict court\u2019s standards for alleging the general aware-\nness and substantial assistance elements, which to-\ngether \u201cform the crux of most JASTA aiding-and-abet-\nting cases.\u201d Pet.App.37. These holdings are detailed \nbelow. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n12 \n \nBLOM \nlargely \nignores \nthese \nholdings. \nSee \nPet.Br.40. But the district court was more forthcom-\ning\u2014it acknowledged that the circuit court only af-\nfirmed on \u201cother grounds.\u201d Pet.App.10. BLOM also \ntries to rehabilitate the district court\u2019s dismissal order \nby suggesting it conforms to this Court\u2019s analysis in \nTaamneh. See Pet.Br.6-7, 8 n.2. But, of course, \nTaamneh affirmed the foreseeability standard from \nHalberstam\u2014the Honickman district court, \u201chowever, \nrejected the foreseeability principle.\u201d Pet.App.39.  \nMoreover, Taamneh had not been issued when \nPlaintiffs sought post-judgment amendment to meet \nthe Second Circuit\u2019s \u201cclarifications\u201d in Kaplan II and \nHonickman II. The issue in this case is the standard \nfor post-judgment amendment where a district court \nhas misapplied controlling law\u2014that is, the law of the \ncircuit. And even if Taamneh had completely repudi-\nated the Second Circuit\u2019s interpretation of JASTA, \nthat would only have provided a further reason to af-\nford Plaintiffs an opportunity to meet this Court\u2019s \nnewly-articulated standard. \nA. The District Court Applied the Wrong \nStandard for Pleading Knowledge \nThe most decisive problem with the district court\u2019s \ndismissal decision was its articulated standard for \npleading knowledge, which required Plaintiffs to al-\nlege \u201cacts or statements by BLOM or BLOM\u2019s employ-\nees\u201d showing their knowledge. Pet.App.73. The Second \nCircuit explained why this standard was incorrect:  \nIn assessing this element, the district court \nfound that the complaint\u2019s references to media \narticles and publications on the Three Custom-\ners\u2019 connection to Hamas were insufficient be-\ncause \u201cPlaintiffs fail[ed] plausibly to allege that \n\n \n \n \n \n \n13 \n \nBLOM [Bank] . . . actually knew or should have \nknown of any of the cited sources.\u201d However, as \nwe explained in Kaplan [II], Plaintiffs did not \nneed to allege that BLOM Bank knew or should \nhave known of the public sources at the plead-\ning stage. Such a requirement at this juncture \nwould be too exacting. \nPet.App.49 (citations omitted). \nThe district court had adopted its erroneous stand-\nard from Kaplan I, before it was vacated in relevant \npart. In Kaplan II, the circuit explained that \u201c[a] com-\nplaint is allowed to contain general allegations as to a \ndefendant\u2019s knowledge because \u2018a plaintiff realistically \ncannot be expected to plead a defendant\u2019s actual state \nof mind,\u2019\u201d although plaintiffs must \u201cinclude allegations \nof the facts or events they claim give rise to an infer-\nence of knowledge.\u201d 999 F.3d at 864 (citations omit-\nted). Moreover, the district court must \u201cconsider all of \nthe complaint\u2019s allegations, rather than considering \neach in isolation, and to accept as true all permissible \ninferences that could be drawn from the complaint as \na whole.\u201d Id. at 865.1  \nThis correction is critical. While Plaintiffs\u2019 pro-\nposed amended complaint submitted in support of \n \n1  \nThe Honickman district court also echoed Kaplan I in \npointing out that with one exception cited in the complaint, the \nU.S. did not designate the Three Customers or their counterpar-\nties as SDGTs until after the transfers at issue (although Israel \nhad designated several of the counterparties as terrorist organi-\nzations years before). See Pet.App.74-75. The circuit rejected this \nstandard in Kaplan II as well, writing: \u201cThe [Kaplan I] court cited \nno authority for such a prerequisite for knowledge, and we know \nof none; and it would defy common sense to hold that such \nknowledge could be gained in no other way.\u201d 999 F.3d at 864. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n14 \n \ntheir vacatur motion contained numerous additional \n\u201cpublic source\u201d allegations (including publications in \nEnglish, French and Arabic) to further support the \n\u201cpermissible inferences\u201d of BLOM\u2019s contemporaneous \nknowledge that it was providing substantial assis-\ntance to Hamas, JA.315-508, those allegations would \nnot satisfy Kaplan I\u2019s \u201cread or was aware of\u201d require-\nment adopted by the district court below. \nB. The District Court Applied the Wrong \nJASTA Standards \nThe Second Circuit also explained that the district \ncourt applied the wrong standards for assessing the \nJASTA elements.  \nAs to general awareness, the Second Circuit first \nset forth the standard given in Halberstam and \nacknowledged in Linde: \u201c[t]he defendant need not be \ngenerally aware of its role in the specific act that \ncaused the plaintiff\u2019s injury; instead, it must be gener-\nally aware of its role in an overall illegal activity from \nwhich the act that caused the plaintiff\u2019s injury was \nforeseeable.\u201d Pet.App.37 (citing Halberstam, 705 F.2d \nat 477, 488). It then explained that the district court \ndid not apply this standard:  \nThe district court, however, rejected the foresee-\nability principle, holding that \u201cit is not enough \nfor Plaintiffs to plausibl[y] allege that BLOM \n[Bank] was generally aware of [its] role in ter-\nrorist activities, from which terrorist attacks \nwere a natural and foreseeable consequence.\u201d \nThe court\u2019s conclusion contravenes both Hal-\nberstam and Linde[], one of the first cases in \nwhich we interpreted aiding-and-abetting lia-\nbility under JASTA. \nPet.App.39 (quoting Pet.App.71-72).  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n15 \n \nIn Taamneh, this Court likewise confirmed that:  \nAs Halberstam makes clear, people who aid and \nabet a tort can be held liable for other torts that \nwere \u201ca foreseeable risk\u201d of the intended \ntort. Accordingly, a close nexus between the as-\nsistance and the tort might help establish that \nthe defendant aided and abetted the tort, but \neven more remote support can still constitute \naiding and abetting in the right case. \n598 U.S. at 496 (quoting Halberstam, 705 F.2d at 488). \nThe Second Circuit rejected BLOM\u2019s argument \nthat providing indirect assistance changes the stand-\nard for pleading knowledge, explaining that \u201cKaplan \n[II] did not so hold; instead, it asserted \u2018the actual \nknowledge component of the Halberstam standard re-\nquires that the defendant \u201cknow[ ]\u201d that it is providing \n\u201cassistance,\u201d . . . whether directly to the FTO or indi-\nrectly through an intermediary.\u2019\u201d Pet.App.46 n.16 \n(quoting Kaplan II, 999 F.3d at 863-64). See also \nPet.App.45 n.15 (rejecting BLOM\u2019s argument regard-\ning customer activities).  \nThe circuit\u2019s Honickman II and Kaplan II decisions \nalso rejected the district court\u2019s assertion that \u201cthe \nmere provision of routine banking services to an FTO \ndoes not render a bank liable for civil aiding and abet-\nting.\u201d Pet.App.71. The Kaplan II court explained that \nso-called \u201croutine\u201d services could suffice depending on \nthe circumstances, and that, under Linde, \u201cwhether a \ndefendant bank\u2019s \u2018financial services to [an FTO or its \naffiliates should or] should not be viewed as routine\u2019 is \na \u2018question[] of fact for a jury to decide.\u2019\u201d 999 F.3d at \n858 (quoting Linde, 882 F.3d at 327) (alterations orig-\ninal to Kaplan II). See also Taamneh, 598 U.S. at 502 \n(noting circumstances \u201cwhere the provider of routine \n\n \n \n \n \n \n16 \n \nservices\u201d could be liable for \u201caiding and abetting a fore-\nseeable terror attack\u201d). \nThe Second Circuit also found that the district \ncourt applied incorrect standards to plead the knowing \nand substantial assistance element. This included \nmisapprehending the \u201cknowing\u201d prong under circuit \nlaw2 and misapplying each of the Halberstam substan-\ntial assistance factors it analyzed. Pet.App.45.  \nThe district court \u201cmisunderstood the first factor, \n\u2018the nature of the act encouraged,\u2019 to be a question of \nwhether Plaintiffs plausibly alleged \u2018that BLOM \n[Bank] knowingly encouraged Hamas\u2019[s] violent activ-\nities, such as those which caused Plaintiffs\u2019 injuries.\u2019\u201d \nPet.App.46. Indeed, the Halberstam defendant did not \n\u201cencourage\u201d her burglar boyfriend to commit the un-\nplanned murder of Dr. Halberstam, of which she had \nno knowledge.  \nThe district court also applied too exacting a stand-\nard for \u201cthe second factor, \u2018the amount of assistance,\u2019\u201d \nrequiring allegations of how the money BLOM moved \nfor Hamas actually made it through the FTO\u2019s fronts. \nTo the contrary, \u201c[f]actual allegations that permit a \nreasonable inference that the defendant recognized \nthe money it transferred to its customers would be re-\nceived by the FTO would suffice.\u201d Pet.App.47. \n \n2  \nThe Second Circuit did not, as some JASTA defendants \nhave suggested, \u201canalyze[] the \u2018knowing\u2019 subelement as a carbon \ncopy of the antecedent element of whether the defendants were \n\u2018generally aware\u2019 of their role in ISIS\u2019 overall scheme.\u201d Taamneh, \n598 U.S. at 503 (citations omitted). It only observed that the same \nfacts could satisfy both mental state elements: \u201cFor instance, Hal-\nberstam . . . . did not require [the defendant] to \u2018know\u2019 anything \nmore about [the murderer\u2019s] unlawful activities than what she \nknew for the general awareness element.\u201d Pet.App.46.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n17 \n \nFinally, under the fourth factor, the defendant\u2019s re-\nlation to the principal, \u201c[t]he district court erroneously \nconstrued\u201d Second Circuit precedent \u201cto mean that \nPlaintiffs must plead a direct relationship between \nBLOM Bank and Hamas.\u201d Pet.App.47-48. A less direct \nrelationship, depending on the circumstances, could \nsuffice. \nAgain, these errors align with BLOM\u2019s \u201cargu-\nments\u201d and \u201ccontentions\u201d to which the district court \ninvited Plaintiffs to respond by amendment. JA.156, \nPet.App.125. Plaintiffs reasonably declined these invi-\ntations, as evidenced by the Second Circuit\u2019s complete \nrejection of them. \nC. The Second Circuit Affirmed the District \nCourt Decision Only on Another Ground \nThe Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal decision \nentirely on one ground: \u201cWe conclude that Plaintiffs\u2019 \naiding-and-abetting claim fails because the allegations \ndo not support an inference that BLOM Bank was \naware of the Three Customers\u2019 ties with Hamas prior \nto the relevant attacks, thereby undermining the sec-\nond element of general awareness.\u201d Pet.App.49. But \nwhereas the district court required allegations of \u201cacts \nor statements\u201d from \u201cBLOM employees\u201d demonstrat-\ning their actual knowledge (which Plaintiffs naturally \ndid not have before discovery), the Second Circuit \nidentified a less exacting set of specific and remediable \ndeficiencies in the complaint\u2019s knowledge allegations. \nChief among these was the circuit\u2019s finding that \nPlaintiffs\u2019 evidence of the Three Customers\u2019 Hamas af-\nfiliations was \u201cpublicly available,\u201d rather than from \n\u201cpublic sources\u201d: \nHowever, \u201cpublicly available\u201d evidence is not \nthe same as public sources such as media \n\n \n \n \n \n \n18 \n \narticles. The latter, depending on their sub-\nstance, \nplausibly \nsuggest \na \ndefendant\u2019s \nknowledge which can be confirmed during dis-\ncovery, whereas the former requires the implau-\nsible inference that the defendant was aware of \nthose facts even before the news media. \nPet.App.50 n.18. The court then went on to find Plain-\ntiffs\u2019 allegations of \u201cpublic sources\u201d too \u201climited\u201d in de-\ntail and numerosity. Pet.App.51. \nPlaintiffs understandably did not anticipate this \nnew evidentiary distinction (the district court cer-\ntainly did not). Moreover, the Second Circuit did not \ncite any precedent for this position, and it is by all ap-\npearances a newly articulated distinction. Nor did the \nKaplan II decision mention any distinction between \n\u201cpublicly available evidence\u201d and \u201cpublic sources\u201d of \nevidence. In fact, \u201cpublicly available evidence\u201d echoes \nthe term the Second Circuit had previously used as a \nbasis for inferring knowledge, relying on this Court\u2019s \nprecedent: \u201cPublicly available information may pro-\nvide relevant circumstantial evidence of actual \nknowledge.\u201d Fed. Hous. Fin. Agency v. Nomura Hold-\ning Am., Inc., 873 F.3d 85, 122 (2d Cir. 2017) (empha-\nsis added) (citing Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa, 539 U.S. \n90, 100 (2003)). Indeed, it seems reasonable that \nbanks, given their unique Know-Your-Customer obli-\ngations and due diligence policies, which assume close \nmonitoring of customer accounts and transactions, \nwould know facts about their customers \u201cbefore the \nnews media\u201d report it (which involves deciding what is \nnewsworthy and what facts are verifiable).  \nBut no matter\u2014Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed amended com-\nplaint included numerous and detailed allegations of \ncontemporaneous \u201cpublic sources\u201d to meet the Second \nCircuit\u2019s requirement.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n19 \n \nThe other defects the circuit identified were also re-\nmediable. For example, the circuit discounted Plain-\ntiffs\u2019 assertion that BLOM must have noticed that the \nThree Customers were receiving funds from desig-\nnated terrorist entities. The circuit noted that the com-\nplaint alleged that Sanabil received transfers from the \n\u201cAl-Aqsa Foundation\u201d after Israel designated it as a \nterrorist organization, but not \u201cwhether and where \nthis [designation] was made public.\u201d Pet.App.52 n.20. \nThe circuit also noted that the complaint needed \u201cfur-\nther allegations\u201d to show that a defendant-bank would \nknow about \u201ctransfers of funds from non-customers as-\nsociated with an FTO to the defendant\u2019s customers.\u201d \nId.  \nThese defects were not due to unreasonable draft-\ning\u2014previous ATA decisions found it reasonable to in-\nfer that a foreign bank would \u201cmonitor publicly avail-\nable information,\u201d including \u201cIsraeli lists of terrorists.\u201d \nWeiss v. Nat\u2019l Westminster Bank PLC, 453 F. Supp. \n2d 609, 627 (E.D.N.Y. 2006) (emphasis added). But the \nproposed amended complaint now includes media re-\nports on the relevant Israeli designations and BLOM\u2019s \nown customer due diligence procedures, such as moni-\ntoring transfer counterparties and non-profit organi-\nzations, which are often used as terror fronts.  \nSimilarly, although Plaintiffs repeatedly empha-\nsized the suspicious nature of Sanabil making large \ncash withdrawals from its BLOM account, the circuit \nsuggesting that the complaint should more explicitly \nallege that cash is \u201cuntraceable.\u201d Pet.App.51 n.19. Alt-\nhough Plaintiffs took that characteristic of cash to be \na reasonable inference rather than a necessary allega-\ntion, they included those explicit allegations in the \nproposed amended complaint. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n20 \n \nV. \nPlaintiffs\u2019 Motion to Vacate and Amend and \nthe Second Appeal \nAs the Second Circuit explained in the summary \norder below, the district court had applied the \u201cwrong \nlegal standards\u201d in dismissing the complaint, so once \n\u201c[a]rmed with this Court\u2019s clarifications, Plaintiffs re-\nturned to the district court,\u201d promptly moving (11 days \nafter Honickman II issued\u2014in fact, before the man-\ndate issued) under Rules 60(b)(6) and 15(a)(2) to va-\ncate the judgment of dismissal and grant them leave \nto file a first amended complaint. JA.315. The district \ncourt denied the motion, concluding that Plaintiffs \nfailed to show extraordinary circumstances chiefly be-\ncause they declined the district court\u2019s two prior invi-\ntations to meet the erroneous and largely impossible \npleading standard BLOM urged and that the district \ncourt erroneously adopted.  \nPlaintiffs again appealed. During argument, Cir-\ncuit Court Judge Wesley\u2014who also authored Honick-\nman II\u2014noted the case constituted an \u201cunusual cir-\ncumstance,\u201d 10/5/2023 Oral Arg. at 3:40, and \u201ca curi-\nous situation,\u201d id. at 10:54, and was \u201cquirky,\u201d id. at \n18:07. And as he recognized, Plaintiffs faced \u201ca wrong \nstandard\u201d \u201cthat\u2019s even harder for them to meet.\u201d Judge \nWesley observed: \u201cWhat are they supposed to do? They \nknow they can\u2019t amend [to] . . . meet that\u201d standard. \nId. at 11:50-56. The dismissal was \u201c[a]ffirmed for a dif-\nferent reason,\u201d as a result of a series of cases \u201cwhere \nthe law was really recasting itself.\u201d Id. at 13:12-38. \nAfter that oral argument in this case, the Second \nCircuit decided Mandala, another \u201cone of the excep-\ntional cases necessitating relief from judgment.\u201d Man-\ndala, 88 F.4th at 365. In Mandala, the plaintiffs \nbrought a putative class action alleging that defendant \nNTT Data\u2019s policy of not hiring people with felony \n\n \n \n \n \n \n21 \n \nconvictions disproportionately harms Black appli-\ncants. See id. at 357. The plaintiffs cited government \nreports showing \u201cBlack people are arrested and incar-\ncerated at higher rates than others.\u201d Id. The district \ncourt dismissed the complaint because it did not show \nthat there was a similar disparity among Black appli-\ncants for NTT\u2019s positions specifically.  \nThe Second Circuit affirmed, \u201cagree[ing] with the \ndistrict court\u201d that the complaint\u2019s statistics did not \nfocus on \u201cappropriate comparator groups.\u201d Id. at 357-\n58 (citation omitted). However, the circuit recognized \n\u201cthat such granular data may be impossible to collect \nwithout discovery,\u201d and that \u201cthe Complaint might \nhave survived dismissal if it had contained allegations \nexplaining \u2018why their chosen national statistics are in \nfact likely to be representative of NTT\u2019s qualified ap-\nplicant pool.\u2019\u201d Id. at 358 (citation omitted). The plain-\ntiffs petitioned for rehearing en banc, and although it \nwas denied, the dissenting judges urged the plaintiffs \nto move for vacatur and leave to amend. The plaintiffs \ndid, and the district court denied the motion.  \nOn appeal, the second Mandala panel acknowl-\nedged that \u201c[i]t wasn\u2019t until this Court\u2019s decision on \nappeal that it became clear what other types of infor-\nmation might suffice at the pleading stage.\u201d Id. at 365. \nAs a result, the panel vacated that denial and re-\nmanded the motion for reconsideration given Foman, \nthe Second Circuit cases Metzler and Williams, and \nother precedents.  \nRecognizing that its \u201cdiscussion of the various con-\nsiderations in Mandala will be particularly helpful to \nthe district court\u2019s analysis\u201d of Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for \nvacatur and leave to amend, the Second Circuit issued \nthe summary order below, likewise citing Foman and \nMetzler. Pet.App.1-8. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n22 \n \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n1. Second Circuit precedent does not meaningfully \ndiffer from other circuits\u2019 post-judgment amendment \nholdings. The summary order below does not \u201chold\u201d \nanything, and the precedents it cites are typical of \nRule 60(b)(6) cases. For example, they uncontrover-\nsially hold that \u201c[r]elief under Rule 60(b)(6) is reserved \nfor cases that present \u2018extraordinary circumstances.\u2019\u201d \nMandala, 88 F.4th at 361 (quoting Liljeberg v. Health \nServs. Acquisition Corp., 486 U.S. 847, 863 (1988)).  \nThis case involves highly exceptional circum-\nstances. The district court applied erroneous stand-\nards for pleading aiding and abetting under JASTA, \nincluding a knowledge pleading standard that was all \nbut impossible to meet. Pet.App.5, 49. Plaintiffs rea-\nsonably declined the district court\u2019s invitation to \namend to meet those erroneous standards. The Second \nCircuit \u201cagree[d]\u201d that those standards were incorrect, \nbut found the complaint did not meet the standards it \n\u201cclarified\u201d on appeal. Pet.App.25, 40 n.11. After the \ndistrict court refused to let Plaintiffs amend their com-\nplaint to meet the clarified standard, the Second Cir-\ncuit directed it to reconsider, given prior precedents. It \ndid not dictate a particular outcome.  \n2. The balancing test the circuit court described is \nalso typical of Rule 60(b)(6) cases. The Second Circuit \nrejects allowing the \u201cliberal amendment policy of Rule \n15(a) to swallow the philosophy favoring finality of \njudgments whole.\u201d Metzler, 970 F.3d at 146 (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted). Rather, the \ntest balances Rule 60(b)\u2019s value of finality \u201cwith the \npreference expressed in the Federal Rules of Civil Pro-\ncedure in general, and Rule 15 in particular, for resolv-\ning disputes on their merits.\u201d Krupski, 560 U.S. at \n550. After all, \u201cthe \u2018whole purpose\u2019 of Rule 60(b) \u2018is to \n\n \n \n \n \n \n23 \n \nmake an exception to finality.\u2019\u201d Buck v. Davis, 580 U.S. \n100, 126 (2017) (citations omitted). \nThe practical effect of that balance is far more mod-\nest than BLOM suggests: \u201cIn the post-judgment con-\ntext, we have indeed given \u2018due regard\u2019 to \u2018the liberal \nspirit of Rule 15\u2019 by ensuring plaintiffs at least one op-\nportunity to replead.\u201d Metzler, 970 F.3d at 146 (quot-\ning Williams, 659 F.3d at 213-14). See also Mandala, \n88 F.4th at 362 (same). Courts regularly recognize the \nimportance of providing plaintiffs an opportunity to \namend their complaints once apprised of actual defects \nin them. Where the dismissal standards are wrong, \nhowever, \u201cthe proper recourse\u201d is an appeal, United \nStates v. Mask of Ka-Nefer-Nefer, 752 F.3d 737, 743 \n(8th Cir. 2014), which Plaintiffs here took. None of \nBLOM\u2019s cited cases suggest that under the circum-\nstances present here Plaintiffs would not be entitled to \namend. \n3. BLOM\u2019s appeal is premised on the unsupported \ninference that the Second Circuit agreed that Plain-\ntiffs \u201cwaived\u201d their opportunities to amend but then \n\u201cdirected district courts to override and rescue parties \nfrom their \u2018free, calculated, [and] deliberate choices.\u2019\u201d \nPet.Br.28-29. But the Second Circuit did not find any \nwaiver. Quite the opposite, it suggested Plaintiffs rea-\nsonably appealed the district court\u2019s dismissal deci-\nsion and never received a meaningful opportunity to \nmeet the correct and newly clarified standards\u2014and \nthus had nothing to waive.  \nBLOM\u2019s litany of \u201cwaived\u201d opportunities to amend \nare not supported by the record and in any event were \nnot accepted by the panel below in discussing post-\njudgment amendment standards. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n24 \n \n4. The Second Circuit\u2019s precedents do not conflict \nwith the text of Rule 60(b) or Rule 15(a). The Second \nCircuit requires determining which Rule 60(b) provi-\nsion applies as a \u201cthreshold issue,\u201d before considering \namendment. Mandala, 88 F.4th at 359. The desire to \namend a complaint itself is insufficient. \n5. Extraordinary circumstances are clearly present \nhere, for the reasons stated above. Plaintiffs were not \nafforded a meaningful opportunity to address actual \ndefects in their complaint. They properly appealed the \ndistrict court\u2019s erroneous decision and then promptly \nsought vacatur to meet the clarified standards the cir-\ncuit issued on appeal. Discovery has not even com-\nmenced\u2014this case is in its infancy, and Plaintiffs \nshould have the opportunity to have their case adjudi-\ncated on the merits. \nARGUMENT  \nI. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s Analysis Is Consistent \nwith Post-Judgment Amendment Jurispru-\ndence Nationally. \nBLOM asserts that the summary order below \n\u201cabandons the \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 standard \nin favor of a nebulous \u2018balanc[ing]\u2019 inquiry that pits \nRule 60(b)(6)\u2019s protection of \u2018finality\u2019 against \u2018Rule \n15(a)\u2019s liberal amendment policies.\u2019\u201d Pet.Br.25 (quot-\ning Pet.App.8). This is inaccurate.  \nFirst, as Respondent acknowledges, the decision \nbelow is a non-precedential summary order which \nmerely \u201c[r]el[ies] on a series of Second Circuit prece-\ndents.\u201d Pet.Br.20. In fact, the order only cites three de-\ncisions on post-judgment amendment\u2014Mandala and \nMetzler from the Second Circuit, and Foman v. Davis, \n371 U.S. 178 (1962), from this Court.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n25 \n \nSecond, these decisions are not erroneous and cer-\ntainly do not \u201cjettison\u201d the extraordinary circum-\nstances standard, as BLOM claims. Pet.Br.14. Man-\ndala holds that \u201c[r]elief under Rule 60(b)(6) is reserved \nfor cases that present \u2018extraordinary circumstances.\u2019\u201d \n88 F.4th at 361 (quoting Liljeberg, 486 U.S. at 863). \nAnd in Metzler, the Second Circuit affirmed denial of \npost-judgment amendment because \u201cthe plaintiffs-ap-\npellants fail[ed] to identify any \u2018extraordinary circum-\nstances\u2019 that would \u2018justify[] relief\u2019 under Rule \n60(b)(6).\u201d 970 F.3d at 147. \nAs explained below, the \u201cextraordinary circum-\nstances\u201d here are clear. This case is, as Judge Wesley \nput it, \u201cunusual,\u201d \u201cquirky,\u201d and \u201ccurious,\u201d appearing to \ndeny Plaintiffs even a single meaningful opportunity \nto amend. The Second Circuit therefore directed the \ndistrict court to reconsider its denial of vacatur given \nthe standards in Mandala and Metzler. As this re-\nmand reflected, Rule 60(b)(6) motions inherently re-\nquire \u201ccase-by-case inquiry,\u201d Stokes v. Williams, 475 \nF.3d 732, 736 (6th Cir. 2007)). Indeed, even if this \nCourt wanted to revisit its jurisprudence on Rule \n60(b), it is difficult to imagine it being able to fashion \nany generally applicable standard based on the \u201cunu-\nsual\u201d procedural history of this case. \nA. Rule 60(b)(6) Jurisprudence Balances Fi-\nnality and the Preference for Deciding \nCases on Their Merits. \nMandala and Metzler both apply the balancing test \narticulated in Williams v. Citigroup: \u201cpostjudgment \nmotions for leave to replead must be evaluated with \ndue regard to both the value of finality and the policies \nembodied in Rule 15.\u201d 659 F.3d at 213. Finality thus \nremains the starting point for applying Rule 60(b)(6) \nin the Second Circuit: \u201c[t]he standards we have \n\n \n \n \n \n \n26 \n \ndeveloped for evaluating postjudgment motions gener-\nally place significant emphasis on the \u2018value of finality \nand repose.\u2019\u201d Id. (citation omitted). The circuit notes \nthat \u2018\u201c[t]o hold otherwise would enable the liberal \namendment policy of Rule 15(a) to be employed in a \nway that is contrary to the philosophy favoring finality \nof judgments and the expeditious termination of liti-\ngation.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Nat\u2019l Petrochemical Co. v. M/T \nStolt Sheaf, 930 F.2d 240, 245 (2d Cir. 1991)). \nFinality is then balanced with Rule 15(a)\u2019s prefer-\nence for resolving cases on their merits, which the Wil-\nliams panel sourced from this Court\u2019s \u201c[p]articularly \ninstructive\u201d Foman decision. 695 F.3d at 213. Foman \nheld that the district court abused its discretion in \ndenying a motion to vacate the judgment in order to \namend the complaint:  \nRule 15(a) declares that leave to amend \u201cshall \nbe freely given when justice so requires\u201d; this \nmandate is to be heeded. See generally, 3 \nMoore, Federal Practice (2d ed. 1948), paras. \n15.08, 15.10. If the underlying facts or circum-\nstances relied upon by a plaintiff may be a \nproper subject of relief, he ought to be afforded \nan opportunity to test his claim on the mer-\nits. In the absence of any apparent or declared \nreason \u2014 such as undue delay, bad faith or di-\nlatory motive on the part of the movant, re-\npeated failure to cure deficiencies by amend-\nments previously allowed, undue prejudice to \nthe opposing party by virtue of allowance of the \namendment, futility of amendment, etc. \u2014 the \nleave sought should, as the rules require, be \n\u201cfreely given.\u201d Of course, the grant or denial of \nan opportunity to amend is within the discre-\ntion of the District Court, but outright refusal to \n\n \n \n \n \n \n27 \n \ngrant the leave without any justifying reason \nappearing for the denial is not an exercise of dis-\ncretion; it is merely abuse of that discretion and \ninconsistent with the spirit of the Federal \nRules. \n371 U.S. at 182.3 See, e.g., United States v. Vorachek, \n563 F.2d 884, 887 (8th Cir. 1977) (vacatur necessary \ngiven Foman and Rule 15(a)).  \nThis Court has always balanced the finality of judg-\nments with the preference for giving plaintiffs \u201can op-\nportunity to test their claims on the merits.\u201d For ex-\nample, this Court \u201cbalance[d] the interests of the de-\nfendant protected by the statute of limitations with \nthe preference expressed in the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure in general, and Rule 15 in particular, for re-\nsolving disputes on their merits.\u201d Krupski, 560 U.S. at \n550. A statute of limitations embodies the value of fi-\nnality and repose, see, e.g., Lozano v. Alvarez, 572 U.S. \n1, 14 (2014), just as, in the Second Circuit, \u201cpostjudg-\nment motions generally place significant emphasis on \n \n3  \nBLOM argues that the circuit erred in relying on Foman \nbecause the vacatur motion in that case was treated as coming \nunder Rule 59(e), not Rule 60(b), and the two rules \u201cdiffer in ma-\nterial ways and impose different standards for relief by their own \nterms.\u201d Pet.Br.18, 34-35. As explained infra 31-32, any such dis-\ntinction does not help BLOM\u2014but it was also completely irrele-\nvant to this Court\u2019s analysis in Foman. The First Circuit had de-\ncided to treat the motion as \u201cfiled pursuant to Rule 59(e), rather \nthan under Rule 60(b)\u201d to resolve an unrelated procedural issue \ninvolving two notices of appeal. Foman v. Davis, 292 F.2d 85, 87 \n(1st Cir. 1961). This Court then noted that the \u201cCourt of Appeals\u2019 \ntreatment of the motion to vacate as one under Rule 59(e) was \npermissible, at least as an original matter, and we will accept \nthat characterization here.\u201d 371 U.S. at 181. It never suggested \nthat the \u201ccharacterization\u201d impacted its review or the vacatur \nstandards it applied.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n28 \n \nthe \u2018value of finality and repose,\u2019\u201d Williams, 659 F.3d \nat 213 (internal citation omitted).  \nThis Court has also always understood Rule 60(b) \nas accommodating that preference, rejecting argu-\nments that overemphasize finality at its expense. For \nexample: \u201c[T]he State reminds us of the importance of \npreserving the finality of judgments. But the \u2018whole \npurpose\u2019 of Rule 60(b) \u2018is to make an exception to final-\nity.\u2019\u201d Buck, 580 U.S. at 126 (citations omitted). BLOM \nrelies heavily on this Court\u2019s analysis of finality in \nGonzalez v. Crosby but omits its conclusion: \u201c[W]e give \nlittle weight to respondent\u2019s appeal to the virtues of \nfinality. That policy consideration, standing alone, is \nunpersuasive in the interpretation of a provision \nwhose whole purpose is to make an exception to final-\nity.\u201d 545 U.S. 524, 529 (2005). Likewise, BLOM quotes \nthis Court\u2019s admonition in United States v. Denedo \nthat \u201cjudgment finality is not to be lightly cast aside,\u201d \nPet.Br.27, but again leaves out the Court\u2019s conclusion: \n\u201cthe finality rule is not so inflexible that it trumps each \nand every competing consideration.\u201d 556 U.S. 904, 916 \n(2009). A \u201cjudgment\u201d based on the wrong reasons, due \nlargely to what the circuit itself concedes to have been \nits own \u201cambigu[ous]\u201d precedent, Pet.App.40 n.11, is \nto be \u201ccast aside\u201d in order to permit disposition on the \nmerits.  \nLike this Court, the Second Circuit rejects \u201ca stand-\nard that overemphasize[s] considerations of finality at \nthe expense of the liberal amendment policy embodied \nin the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\u201d Williams, 659 \nF.3d at 210. And like this Court, the Second Circuit \nholds that \u201cRule 60(b) relief is designed to afford par-\nties an opportunity to resolve a dispute on its merits.\u201d \nNemaizer v. Baker, 793 F.2d 58, 63 (2d Cir. 1986) (cit-\ning 7 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, \u00b6 60.19, at 156 (2d ed. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n29 \n \n1983)). That is, the policies underlying Rules 60(b) and \n15(a) work \u201cin tandem,\u201d as the Second Circuit ex-\nplained below. Pet.App.7. \nThe circuit courts have also consistently recognized \nthis balance inherent in Rule 60(b)(6). The rule\u2019s \u201c[ex-\ntraordinary circumstances] requirement exists in or-\nder to balance the broad language of Rule 60(b)(6), \nwhich allows courts to set aside judgments for \u2018any\u2019 \nreason justifying relief, with the interest in the finality \nof judgments.\u201d Budget Blinds, 536 F.3d at 255. The \nNinth Circuit sourced this principle to Gonzalez:  \nAs the Sixth Circuit rightly held when applying \nGonzalez, \u201cthe decision to grant Rule 60(b)(6) \nrelief is a case-by-case inquiry that requires the \ntrial court to intensively balance numerous fac-\ntors, including the competing policies of the fi-\nnality of judgments and the incessant command \nof the court\u2019s conscience that justice be done in \nlight of all the facts.\u201d  \nPhelps v. Alameida, 569 F.3d 1120, 1133 (9th Cir. \n2009) (quoting Stokes, 475 F.3d at 736). See also In re \nSpansion, Inc., 507 F. App\u2019x 125, 128 (3d Cir. 2012) \n(\u201cThe rule seeks \u2018to strike a proper balance between \nthe conflicting principles that litigation must be \nbrought to an end and that justice must be done.\u2019\u201d) (ci-\ntation omitted); Blue Diamond Coal Co. v.

Miller & M.K. \nKane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2851 (2d ed. \n1995) (same). \nThe Eighth Circuit has held that district courts re-\nviewing post-judgment motions to amend under Rule \n59(e) or Rule 60(b) \u2018\u201cmay not ignore the Rule 15(a)(2) \nconsiderations that favor affording parties an oppor-\ntunity to test their claims on the merits . . . .\u2019\u201d Mask of \nKa-Nefer-Nefer, 752 F.3d at 743 (quoting United \nStates ex rel. Roop v. Hypoguard USA, Inc., 559 F.3d \n818, 823-24 (8th Cir. 2009)). Indeed, Moore\u2019s Federal \nPractice specifically notes that \u201c[t]he hybrid approach \nof the Second and Eighth Circuits strikes the correct \nbalance: it protects the strong interest in finality of \njudgments and the expeditious termination of litiga-\ntion, while allowing postjudgment amendment of \npleadings in a particular case if justice requires.\u201d 12 \nMoore\u2019s Federal Practice - Civil \u00a7 59.30. For that prop-\nosition, Moore\u2019s relies on two Rule 60(b)(6) cases\u2014Wil-\nliams and Mask of Ka-Nefer-Nefer. Id., \u00a7 59.30 n.9.1.3, \nn.9.1.4. \nThe Seventh Circuit gives even greater weight to \nRule 15 interests when the district court has entered \njudgment at the same time it dismisses a complaint: \nBecause Rules 59(e) and 60(b) are reserved for \nextraordinary cases, the Girl Scouts urge us to \napply a more demanding standard to post-judg-\nment motions to amend than we do to motions \nto amend filed prior to the entry of judgment. \n \n4  \nThe same is true for Rule 59(e), in which \u201c[t]he court must \nstrike the proper balance between two competing imperatives: (1) \nfinality, and (2) the need to render just decisions on the basis of \nall the facts.\u201d Edward H. Bohlin Co. v. Banning Co., 6 F.3d 350, \n355 (5th Cir. 1993). \n\n \n \n \n \n \n31 \n \nBut the extraordinary nature of these remedies \ndoes not mean that a different standard ap-\nplies\u2014at least when judgment was entered at \nthe same time the case was first dismissed. \nWhen the district court has taken the unusual \nstep of entering judgment at the same time it \ndismisses the complaint, the court need not find \nother extraordinary circumstances and must \nstill apply the liberal standard for amending \npleadings under Rule 15(a). \nRunnion v. Girl Scouts of Greater Chi. & Nw. Ind., 786 \nF.3d 510, 521 (7th Cir. 2015). See also NewSpin \nSports, Ltd. Liab. Co. v. Arrow Elecs., Inc., 910 F.3d \n293, 310 (7th Cir. 2018) (same). \nBLOM attempts to draw a distinction between \npost-judgment analyses under \u201cRules 59(e) and 60(b),\u201d \nrelying on Daulatzai v. Maryland, 97 F.4th 166 (4th \nCir. 2024). Pet.Br.34-35. But Daulatzai only held that \nunder Rule 59(e), a court should solely \u201capply the more \nspecific standard of Rule 15(a),\u201d and \u201cneed not concern \nitself\u201d with Rule 59(e)\u2019s other standards. 97 F.4th at \n177 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \nSee also Rosenzweig v. Azurix Corp., 332 F.3d 854, 864 \n(5th Cir. 2003) (\u201cthis Court has held that, under these \ncircumstances, the considerations for a Rule 59(e) mo-\ntion are governed by Rule 15(a)\u201d); Jang v. Bos. Sci. \nScimed, Inc., 729 F.3d 357, 368 (3d Cir. 2013) (\u201c[w]here \na timely motion to amend judgment is filed under Rule \n59(e), the Rule 15 and 59 inquiries turn on the same \nfactors.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omit-\nted); Allen v. Walmart Stores, L.L.C., 907 F.3d 170, \n184 (5th Cir. 2018) (same).5 Daulatzai unremarkably \n \n5  \nBLOM relies heavily on Banister v. Davis, 590 U.S. 504 \n(2020), but that case deals with what types of vacatur motions \ncount as a successive habeas application. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n32 \n \nheld that \u201cto obtain relief from a final judgment under \nRule 60(b), one of the six grounds enumerated must be \nsatisfied,\u201d including finding \u201cextraordinary circum-\nstances\u201d under Rule 60(b)(6). 97 F.4th at 178. The \nplaintiff failed to show \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d \nthere because she had already amended twice, and her \namendment \u201cefforts were pursued in bad faith.\u201d Id. at \n170. The extraordinary circumstances requirement is \nthe same in Metzler and Mandala (and in Runnion, \nwhich did find \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d).  \nIn sum, BLOM\u2019s claim that \u201cevery one of [the Sec-\nond Circuit\u2019s] sister Circuits\u201d disagrees with it is \nsimply wrong. Pet.Br.25. A number of BLOM\u2019s own \ncases recognize the need to balance competing policies \nin Rule 60(b). For example, in Leisure Caviar, LLC v. \nUnited States Fish & Wildlife Service, the Sixth Cir-\ncuit explained that while amendment should be \u201cfreely \nallowed,\u201d \u201cwhen a Rule 15 motion comes after a judg-\nment against the plaintiff,\u201d courts \u201cmust \u2018consider[] \nthe competing interest of protecting the finality of \njudgments\u201d; that is, \u201c[i]nstead of meeting only the \nmodest requirements of Rule 15, the claimant must \nmeet the requirements for reopening a case estab-\nlished by Rules 59 or 60.\u201d 616 F.3d 612, 615-16 (6th \nCir. 2010) (citations omitted) (emphases added). Like \nin Phelps, Leisure Caviar directs courts to balance the \n\u201ccompeting\u201d policies of Rule 15 and Rule 60.  \nAnd in Nation v. DOI, the Ninth Circuit explained \nthat \u201c[a]fter judgment . . . \u2018our policy of promoting the \nfinality of judgments\u2019 somewhat displaces Rule 15\u2019s \nopenhandedness,\u201d given Rule 60(b)(6)\u2019s predicate of \nextraordinary circumstances. 876 F.3d 1144, 1173 (9th \nCir. 2017) (citation omitted) (emphasis added). That \ncase affirmed denial of post-judgment leave to amend \nbecause the plaintiff had already twice amended and \n\n \n \n \n \n \n33 \n \nfailed to identify how yet another amendment could \ncure its standing problem.  \nMost of BLOM\u2019s remaining cases simply note that \na judgment must be appealed or vacated before a com-\nplaint is amended or that Rule 15(a) does not alone \nprovide the analytical basis for vacatur\u2014but none dis-\npute that the Rule 15 principles could inform the ex-\nceptional circumstances analysis. See Rosenzweig, 332 \nF.3d at 864 (explaining that post-judgment amend-\nment requires appeal or vacatur); In re Ferro Corp. \nDerivative Litig., 511 F.3d 611, 624 (6th Cir. 2008) \n(same); Helm v. Resolution Tr. Corp., 84 F.3d 874, 879 \n(7th Cir. 1996) (same); Bldg. Indus. Ass\u2019n v. Norton, \n247 F.3d 1241, 1245 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (same); Boyd v. \nSecretary, 114 F.4th 1232, 1237 (11th Cir. 2024) \n(same). Indeed, in a case BLOM cites for the proposi-\ntion that \u201cthere is no pending complaint to amend\u201d \nonce \u201cthe action has been dismissed\u201d with prejudice, \nthe opinion noted that courts still apply \u201cRule 15 \nstandards\u201d to such vacatur motions. Calvary Christian \nCenter v. City of Fredericksburg, 710 F.3d 536, 540 \n(4th Cir. 2013). \nTo the extent that any of BLOM\u2019s cases can be read \nto suggest that Rule 15(a)\u2019s preference for determining \ncases on their merits plays no role in motions for post-\njudgment amendment, they are out of step with the \nother circuits. BLOM quotes Garrett v. Wexford \nHealth as holding that under Rule 60(b), \u201c[t]he permis-\nsive policy favoring amendment under Rule 15 was \nsimply not relevant.\u201d 938 F.3d 69, 86 (3d Cir. 2019). \nBut that case cited and relied on Leisure Caviar, 616 \nF.3d at 615-16, which requires courts to weigh the \n\u201ccompeting interests\u201d of Rules 15 and 60. The starker \nlanguage in Garrett was understandable as the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n34 \n \nplaintiff had already amended his complaint four \ntimes, clearly exhausting the policy of liberal amend-\nment.  \nUnsurprisingly, BLOM has selected cases where \nplaintiffs have thoroughly exhausted any chance to \namend. As noted above, Daulatzai involved a motion \nto file a fourth complaint, \u201cpursued in bad faith.\u201d 97 \nF.4th at 170. In James v. Watt, 716 F.2d 71, 77 (1st \nCir. 1983), the delay in amendment was \u201cstrategic.\u201d In \nIn re Ferro, the plaintiff did not have an actual amend-\nment in mind and needed discovery. 511 F.3d at 624. \nSee also Helm, 84 F.3d at 879 (\u201cinexcusable attorney \nnegligence\u201d); UMB Bank, N.A. v. Guerin, 89 F.4th \n1047, 1057-58 (8th Cir. 2024) (proposed second \namended complaint \u201crepeats . . . scandalous, logically \nirrelevant material\u201d and was futile) (internal quota-\ntion marks and citations omitted); Nation, 876 F.3d at \n1174 (plaintiff \u201camended its complaint twice before\u201d \ndismissal).  \nB. Rule 60(b)\u2019s Balancing Means Ensuring \nParties Have a Meaningful Opportunity \nto Amend Pleadings at Least Once, \nWhich Courts Broadly Support. \nIn the Second Circuit, the practical effect of the bal-\nancing inquiry for post-judgment motions to amend is \nfar less dramatic than BLOM suggests: \u201cIn the post-\njudgment context, we have indeed given \u2018due regard\u2019 \nto \u2018the liberal spirit of Rule 15\u2019 by ensuring plaintiffs \nat least one opportunity to replead.\u201d Metzler, 970 F.3d \nat 146 (quoting Williams, 659 F.3d at 213-14). See also \nMandala, 88 F.4th at 362 (same). If the plaintiff has \nhad a meaningful chance to amend, dismissal is no \nlonger extraordinary:  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n35 \n \nIn most if not all Second Circuit cases denying \npost-judgment leave to replead, the plaintiff \nhad already taken at least one shot at amend-\nment. This makes sense: when a plaintiff al-\nready had multiple chances to state a claim, \nthere is little risk of manifest injustice in deny-\ning yet another go. \nId. (citations omitted). \nBut a chance to state a claim is only meaningful if \nthe claimant has been fairly instructed in the correct \nlegal standard, either by a ruling of the district court \nor by clear precedent. Such a ruling identifies actual \nand remediable defects in the complaint, if any. See, \ne.g., United States ex rel. Customs Fraud Investiga-\ntions, LLC v. Victaulic Co., 839 F.3d 242, 250 (3d Cir. \n2016) (observing that without a ruling, \u201ca plaintiff is \nunlikely to know whether his complaint is actually de-\nficient\u2014and in need of revision\u201d); Tate v. SCR Med. \nTransp., 809 F.3d 343, 346 (7th Cir. 2015) (\u201cthe court \nshould grant leave to amend after dismissal of the first \ncomplaint \u2018unless it is certain from the face of the com-\nplaint that any amendment would be futile or other-\nwise unwarranted\u2019\u201d) (citation omitted); United States \nex rel. Lee v. Corinthian Colls., 655 F.3d 984, 998 (9th \nCir. 2011) (\u201c[plaintiffs] should have at least one oppor-\ntunity to add any such facts to the Complaint\u201d); Fire-\nstone v. Firestone, 76 F.3d 1205, 1208 (D.C. Cir. 1996) \n(similar). The Second Circuit noted that it is an \u201cim-\npropriety\u201d to deny amendment \u201cwithout the benefit of \na ruling,\u201d as that presents plaintiffs with a \u201cHobson\u2019s \nchoice: agree to cure deficiencies not yet fully briefed \nand decided or forfeit the opportunity to replead.\u201d Lo-\nreley Fin. (Jersey) No. 3 Ltd. v. Wells Fargo Sec., LLC, \n797 F.3d 160, 190 (2d Cir. 2015). \n\n \n \n \n \n \n36 \n \nOrdinarily, entering judgment dismissing a case \nwithout the opportunity to amend is an abuse of dis-\ncretion. See supra 30-31 (quoting Runnion, 786 F.3d at \n521). See also Jack v. Evonik Corp., 79 F.4th 547, 565 \n(5th Cir. 2023) (\u201cPlaintiffs should usually be able to \namend at least once, because \u2018fairness requires\u2019 it.\u201d) \n(citation omitted). In such case, \u201c[t]he district court left \nthe plaintiff with little recourse but to file a motion \nunder Rules 59(e) and 60(b) . . . .\u201d Foster v. DeLuca, \n545 F.3d 582, 584 (7th Cir. 2008).  \nIn fact, Plaintiffs\u2019 motion here would have come un-\nder Rule 59(e), which BLOM\u2019s cases suggest are eval-\nuated under Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal standards only, see \nsupra 31-32\u2014if not for the necessity of appealing the \ndistrict court\u2019s erroneous and essentially impossible \npleading standards first. See Mask of Ka-Nefer-Nefer, \n752 F.3d at 743 (explaining that appealing is \u201cthe \nproper recourse\u201d where a dismissal decision is wrong). \nAs the Seventh Circuit explained, \u201ca plaintiff who re-\nceives a Rule 12(b)(6) motion and who has good reason \nto think the complaint is sufficient may also choose to \nstand on the complaint and insist on a decision with-\nout losing the benefit of the well-established liberal \nstandard for amendment with leave of court under \nRule 15(a)(2).\u201d Runnion, 786 F.3d at 523. \nOf course, that entailed a risk\u2014Plaintiffs could \nhave been wrong on appeal. If the Second Circuit had \naffirmed the district court\u2019s reasoning (and not just \noutcome), that would not be an \u201cexceptional circum-\nstance\u201d\u2014that happens routinely and when it does, a \nplaintiff may have made a \u201cfree, calculated, [and] de-\nliberate choice\u201d not to take advantage of any prior op-\nportunities to amend. The circuit\u2019s affirmance on other \ngrounds here was thus fortuitous for BLOM\u2014but that \n\n \n \n \n \n \n37 \n \ndoes not justify elevating finality over the interests of \njustice. \nThis is why BLOM is compelled to argue that the \nSecond Circuit really affirmed dismissal of the case on \nthe same \u201cgrounds\u201d the district court used. Pet.Br.40. \nBut the district court acknowledged its dismissal was \nonly affirmed \u201con other grounds.\u201d Pet.App.10. The Sec-\nond Circuit\u2019s ground for affirmance involved one of the \nsame elements (knowledge), but for a fundamentally \ndifferent reason: the (original and still only) complaint \nrelied too much on \u201cpublicly available evidence\u201d rather \nthan \u201cpublic sources\u201d of information identifying \nBLOM\u2019s customers as Hamas-affiliated entities, and \nits allegation of the latter was too \u201climited.\u201d \nPet.App.51. \nThat the pleading standard was clarified on appeal \nis grounds to permit amendment, not deny it. For ex-\nample, in Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., \nthis Court explained that \u201c[w]hile we reject the Sev-\nenth Circuit\u2019s approach . . . we do not decide whether, \nunder the standard we have described . . . the Share-\nholders\u2019 allegations\u201d are sufficient. Because the lower \ncourts lacked \u201cthe opportunity to consider the matter \nin light of the prescriptions we announce today,\u201d the \nCourt vacated judgment \u201cso that the case may be reex-\namined in accord with our construction . . . .\u201d 551 U.S. \n308, 329 (2007). And after clarifying the Rule 8 plead-\ning standard in Ashcroft v. Iqbal, this Court ordered \nthat \u201c[t]he Court of Appeals should decide in the first \ninstance whether to remand to the District Court so \nthat respondent can seek leave to amend his deficient \ncomplaint.\u201d 556 U.S. 662, 687 (2009). See also Johnson \nv. City of Shelby, 574 U.S. 10, 12 (2014) (reversing dis-\nmissal with instructions to permit amendment if nec-\nessary). See also Marranzano v. Riggs Nat\u2019l Bank, 184 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n38 \n \nF.2d 349, 351 (D.C. Cir. 1950) (where a decision is \u201caf-\nfirmed\u201d but \u201cbased on an incorrect ground,\u201d the \u201cends \nof justice\u201d require \u201can opportunity to amend [the] com-\nplaint\u201d); Oil, Chem. & Atomic Workers Int\u2019l Union v. \nDelta Ref. Co., 277 F.2d 694, 697 (6th Cir. 1960) \n(where \u201cthe views which we have expressed give the \ncase a somewhat different aspect than it had under the \ntrial court\u2019s ruling,\u201d amendment is appropriate).  \nAfter the Second Circuit affirmed dismissal on \nother grounds in Honickman II, it left Plaintiffs the \nchoice of whether to move for post-judgment leave to \namend, if they thought they had the allegations to do \nso. But as is clear from the subsequent summary order \nbelow remanding the case for further consideration, \nthat affirmance was not intended to preclude Plain-\ntiffs from seeking an opportunity to amend.  \nII. \nThe Second Circuit Did Not Find Waiver, \nand Thus Did Not Alter the Vacatur Stand-\nard in Its Summary Order \nBLOM\u2019s argument hangs on the straw man that \nthe Second Circuit agreed that Plaintiffs \u201cconsistently \nand consciously rejected numerous invitations and op-\nportunities to amend,\u201d but nevertheless \u201cdirected dis-\ntrict courts to override and rescue parties from their \n\u2018free, calculated, [and] deliberate choices.\u2019\u201d Pet.Br.28-\n29 (citations omitted). Although BLOM pressed this \nargument to the circuit below, see BLOM Brief, No. 22-\n1039, Dkt. No. 42, at 1-2, 41-43, the circuit did not find \nany such waiver. To the contrary, it found that the dis-\ntrict court applied a \u201cwrong standard\u201d that was un-\nmeetable. As Judge Wesley asked BLOM\u2019s counsel \nduring the oral argument below, \u201cWhat are [Plaintiffs] \nsupposed to do? They know they can\u2019t amend [to] \n. . . meet\u201d the standard BLOM urged and the district \ncourt adopted. Notably, BLOM does not challenge the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n39 \n \nSecond Circuit\u2019s findings as to waiver in its question \npresented here. \nNevertheless, BLOM attempts to muster evidence \nof occasions when Plaintiffs forfeited opportunities to \namend. The first two \u201copportunities\u201d were the district \ncourt\u2019s invitations to amend before issuing its dismis-\nsal decision. But these opportunities were not mean-\ningful because they offered only to amend in conform-\nity with the incorrect legal standards BLOM urged, \ngiving Plaintiffs no notice of defects under the correct \nlegal standard. See, e.g., Bryant v. Dupree, 252 F.3d \n1161, 1164 (11th Cir. 2001) (\u201cit cannot be said that the \nplaintiffs failed to correct defects of which they had no-\ntice\u201d) (emphasis added). There is no forfeiture where \n\u201cDefendants did not [identify] below\u201d and \u201cthe district \ncourt itself did not rely on the deficiencies we have \nidentified in dismissing\u201d a plaintiff\u2019s claims\u2014espe-\ncially where \u201cthe district court\u2019s reasoning meant that \nno such amendments would remedy the defects that \nthe district court perceived.\u201d Charles Schwab Corp. v. \nBank of Am. Corp., 883 F.3d 68, 89-90 (2d Cir. 2018).  \nAgain, even the district court here acknowledged \nthat its dismissal decision was only affirmed \u201con other \ngrounds.\u201d Pet.App.10. BLOM notes that Plaintiffs \ncould have added some useful additional allegations in \ntheir proposed amended complaint before appealing, \nbut it would have been futile to do so given that Plain-\ntiffs would still have failed to meet each of the district \ncourt\u2019s (erroneous) standards.  \nIndeed, if declining these pre-judgment \u201copportuni-\nties\u201d to amend constituted waiver, litigants would be \ncompelled to file serial (futile) amendments and re-\nbrief Rule 12(b) motions simply to preserve their \nrights to amend post-appeal, which would hardly im-\nprove the efficiency of the lower federal courts or lead \n\n \n \n \n \n \n40 \n \nto more equitable outcomes. Likewise, a rule that dis-\nincentives bringing valid cases \u201cwhere the law [i]s re-\nally recasting itself\u201d in the circuit courts, as Judge \nWesley observed it was here, Oral Arg. at 13:23-38, \ndoes not promote the interests of justice. \nBLOM faults Plaintiffs for not moving for vacatur-\nfor-amendment instead of appealing, or not appealing \nthe with-prejudice nature of the dismissal. Pet.Br.11. \nPlaintiffs did not seek vacatur before appealing be-\ncause there is \u201cno reason\u201d to \u201cfile a post-judgment mo-\ntion seeking leave to amend\u201d where \u201cthe district \ncourt\u2019s reasoning meant that no such amendments \nwould remedy the defects that the district court per-\nceived.\u201d Charles Schwab, 883 F.3d at 90. Again, \u201cthe \nproper recourse when [a party] disagreed with the dis-\ntrict court\u2019s interpretation of the . . . statute was a di-\nrect appeal, not a Rule 60(b) motion.\u201d Mask of Ka-\nNefer-Nefer, 752 F.3d at 743. And Plaintiffs did not \nappeal the \u201cwith-prejudice\u201d component of the dismis-\nsal decision because leave to amend would not have \naltered the result without the circuit first correcting \nthe district court\u2019s legal errors.  \nFinally, BLOM also faults Plaintiffs for not asking \nthe circuit court for leave to amend in their post-argu-\nment supplemental brief in Honickman II. Pet.Br.11. \nThough asking the circuit for leave to amend is per-\nmissible, in the Second Circuit, post-judgment leave to \namend is generally a decision for the district court to \nmake \u201cin the first instance.\u201d Iqbal v. Ashcroft, 574 F.3d \n820, 822 (2d Cir. 2009).6 The circuit court\u2019s job is to \n \n6  \nBLOM also faults Plaintiffs for \u201cnot seek[ing] rehearing,\u201d \nPet.Br.12, but in the Mandala dissent BLOM relies on, Judge Sul-\nlivan criticized precisely that: \u201c[r]ather than seek vacatur and \nleave to amend\u201d after the first appeal, \u201cPlaintiffs instead opted to \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n41 \n \nassess the district court\u2019s ruling\u2014it goes without say-\ning that if a viable amendment is necessary, plaintiffs \nwill want to make it. The summary order demon-\nstrates that the circuit court did not find a need for \nPlaintiffs to have requested leave to amend from the \nfirst panel (Judge Wesley was on both unanimous pan-\nels). \nIII. \nThe Balancing Inquiry Does Not Conflict \nwith the Text of Any of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure. \nBLOM argues that the Second Circuit\u2019s precedent \nconflicts with the plain text of Rule 15(a) and Rule \n60(b). To do so, it erroneously construes the Second \nCircuit\u2019s basis for remand as \u201callow[ing] plaintiffs to \nleapfrog over \u2018Rule 60(b)\u2019s finality gauntlet\u2019 to the \nsanctuary of \u2018Rule 15(a)\u2019s liberal repleading policy.\u2019\u201d \nPet.Br.30. Again, the Second Circuit directs district \ncourts to balance Rule 60(b)\u2019s finality and Rule 15(a)\u2019s \nliberality \u201cin tandem,\u201d Pet.App.7; it does not permit \n\u201cleapfrogging.\u201d See Meltzer, 970 F.3d at 146 (finding \nthe \u201cargument that the [post-judgment] motion is gov-\nerned solely by the legal standard applicable to Rule \n15(a)(2) motions . . . without merit.\u201d). \nTo establish a textual conflict, BLOM argues that \nRule 15(a) \u201capplies only to \u2018Amendments Before \nTrial,\u2019\u201d and \u201c[i]t is in that setting . . . that the Rules \nencourage courts to \u2018freely give leave\u2019 to amend.\u201d \nPet.Br.30. Thus, BLOM suggests, Rule 15\u2019s preference \n \nfile a petition for rehearing en banc\u2014a strategic choice that \nplainly undermines any argument that some aspect of the district \ncourt\u2019s order was an \u2018extraordinary circumstance\u2019 preventing \nPlaintiffs from pursuing their claims.\u201d 88 F.4th at 368. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n42 \n \nfor deciding cases on their merits is entirely extin-\nguished at judgment.  \nBut Rule 15 contemplates two stages of amend-\nment\u2014before trial and during or after trial. Both in-\nvolve \u201cfreely\u201d giving leave to amend, under certain cir-\ncumstances which depend on trial, not judgment. See \nRule 15(a)(2), Rule 15(b)(1). The rule has no higher \nstandard. \nIndeed, \n\u201c\u2018[a]mendments \nunder \n[Rule \n15(a)(2)] may be made at any stage of the litigation.\u2019 \nGranting leave to amend after summary judgment is \nthus allowed at the discretion of the trial court.\u201d Ngu-\nyen v. United States, 792 F.2d 1500, 1502 (9th Cir. \n1986) (quoting 6 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Prac-\ntice and Procedure \u00a7 1484 (1971)). See also Dussouy v. \nGulf Coast Inv. Corp., 660 F.2d 594, 598 (5th Cir. \n1981) (applying Rule 15 and noting that \u201c[i]nstances \nabound in which appellate courts on review have re-\nquired that leave to amend be granted after dismissal \nor entry of judgment\u201d). \nObviously, this case was not dismissed after trial\u2014\nit was dismissed following an initial Rule 12(b)(6) mo-\ntion, before Plaintiffs had the opportunity to try to \ncure any actual defects in their complaint. That is pre-\ncisely the context that Rule 15(a) squarely addresses. \nEntering judgment does not eliminate Rule 15(a)\u2019s \npreference for \u201cresolving disputes on their merits.\u201d \nKrupski, 560 U.S. at 550. \nBLOM argues that Rule 15(a) \u201cdoes not provide a \nmechanism for amending pleadings after dismissal,\u201d \nPet.Br.30, but that is likewise irrelevant. To the extent \nRule 60(b)(6) provides the \u201cmechanism,\u201d it is an \u201cex-\nception to finality\u201d for \u201cany reason that justifies relief.\u201d \nGranting leave to amend \u201cwhen justice so requires,\u201d as \nRule 15(a) commands, presumably informs the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n43 \n \nreasons that \u201cjustify relief\u201d under Rule 60(b)(6)\u2014in-\ncluding providing an opportunity to amend at least \nonce.7  \nBLOM asserts that the Second Circuit\u2019s \u201cbalancing \ntest\u201d conflicts with the rest of Rule 60(b) because it \nwould permit plaintiffs to \u201cevade those explicit time \nlimitations in\u201d Rule 60(b)(1) (relief given mistake or \nexcusable neglect) and Rule 60(b)(2) (relief given new \nevidence). Pet.Br.31-33. But the Second Circuit has \nnever suggested that vacatur and amendment are per-\nmissible where a complaint failed due to counsel\u2019s mis-\ntake or where a plaintiff simply wants to present new \nevidence over a year after judgment. Instead, a district \ncourt\u2019s failure to give plaintiffs at least one meaningful \nopportunity to replead may constitute extraordinary \ncircumstances, and vacatur and amendment may be \nappropriate.  \nIn Mandala, the Second Circuit determined which \nprovision of Rule 60(b) applied before turning to the \npolicies and standards of either Rule 60(b) or Rule \n15(a): \u201cProper characterization of Plaintiffs\u2019 Rule 60(b) \nmotion is a threshold issue because, as previously ex-\nplained, [Rule 60(b)\u2019s] provisions are subject to differ-\nent filing limitations . . . .\u201d 88 F.4th at 359. The Second \nCircuit determined that Rule 60(b)(6) was the proper \nrule because \u201cinsufficient pleading is not categorically \na \u2018mistake,\u2019 and Plaintiffs\u2019 belief that their Complaint \nsatisfied the standards for pleading a disparate impact \nclaim was well-founded, even if ultimately erroneous.\u201d \nId. \n \n7  \nBLOM contends that this Court should read Rule 60(b) \nwith Rule 1, not Rule 15(a). Pet.Br.35-38. But Rule 1 does not \nnegate Rule 15\u2014to the extent Rule 1 provides any guidance here, \nit is its command to secure the \u201cjust\u201d outcome. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n44 \n \nNor does the decision below conflict with Rule \n60(b)(2), which only permits vacatur to introduce (1) \nnewly discovered evidence (2) within a year of judg-\nment. The Second Circuit does not permit post-judg-\nment amendments \u201cbased on previously omitted alle-\ngations,\u201d as BLOM asserts (or evidence discovered \nover a year after judgment). Pet.Br.33. In fact, Metzler \nrejected an attempt to circumvent Rule 60(b)(2)\u2019s \n\u201cnewly discovered evidence standard.\u201d 970 F.3d at 146. \nThat case still required a showing of extraordinary cir-\ncumstances under Rule 60(b)(6). BLOM points out \nthat movants might introduce allegations they could \nhave presented before, Pet.Br.33, but Rule 60(b) gives \nreasons for vacating a judgment\u2014it does not limit \nwhat a party can include in an amended pleading once \nvacatur and leave to amend are granted. \nTo be clear, BLOM no longer appears to contest \nthat Rule 60(b)(6) applies in this case. The district \ncourt itself found that Rule 60(b)(6) applied here, not-\ning that \u201cnone of [the other provisions] are applicable\u201d \nto Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for vacatur. Pet.App.12. BLOM \ndid nevertheless argue to the panel below that Rule \n60(b)(1) applied, but the circuit did not accept the ar-\ngument, assessing the case under Rule 60(b)(6). See \nPet.App.6-7. BLOM did not challenge the district \ncourt\u2019s or circuit court\u2019s application of Rule 60(b)(6) in \nits petition for certiorari or in their merits brief to this \nCourt. \nIV. \nExtraordinary Circumstances Are Present \nHere Because After Honickman II Clarified \nthe Previously \u201cAmbigu[ous]\u201d Legal Stand-\nards, Plaintiffs Were Denied Any Oppor-\ntunity to Meet Them. \nAs this Court has explained, \u201c[i]n determining \nwhether extraordinary circumstances are present \n\n \n \n \n \n \n45 \n \n[under Rule 60(b)(6)], a court may consider a wide \nrange of factors,\u201d including \u201c\u2018the risk of injustice to the \nparties\u2019 and \u2018the risk of undermining the public\u2019s con-\nfidence in the judicial process.\u2019\u201d Buck, 580 U.S. at 123 \n(quoting Liljeberg, 486 U.S. at 864). In Mandala, the \nSecond Circuit noted several factors in that case that \nestablished exceptional circumstances for purposes of \na motion for post-judgment amendment: \n[1] Plaintiffs have yet to be afforded a single op-\nportunity to amend their pleading; [2] the orig-\ninal dismissal of the Complaint was premised \non grounds subject to reasonable, actual, and \nvigorous debate; [3] Plaintiffs diligently prose-\ncuted their case at all times; and [4] Plaintiffs\u2019 \nproposed amendments address the sole plead-\ning deficiency identified by the district court.  \n88 F.4th at 365.  \nPlaintiffs meet all of these factors here. Denying \nPlaintiffs leave to amend risks injustice, as they may \nlose their only opportunity to have this case decided on \nthe merits, as the statute of limitations has run on \ntheir claims. See LeBlanc v. Cleveland, 248 F.3d 95, \n101 (2d Cir. 2001) (finding \u201c\u2018extraordinary circum-\nstances\u2019 under Rule 60(b)(6), because [plaintiff] would \nbe left without a remedy if the motion [for vacatur and \nleave to amend] were not granted\u201d). And where the \ncase is at its earliest stage, with no discovery con-\nducted, the prejudice to BLOM is limited solely to \nbriefing a new motion to dismiss against allegations \ntailored to meet the legal standards articulated by the \nSecond Circuit and this Court in Taamneh. The poten-\ntial burden of re-briefing a motion to dismiss is already \nbuilt into Rules 15(a)(1) and (2) and is not the kind of \nprejudice that the Rule considers. See, e.g., Patton v. \nGuyer, 443 F.2d 79, 86 (10th Cir. 1971) (\u201cThere is \n\n \n \n \n \n \n46 \n \ninvariably some practical prejudice resulting from an \namendment, but this is not the test for refusal of an \namendment. . . . The defendants were not prejudiced \nin terms of preparing their defense to the amend-\nment.\u201d). \nIndeed, courts have applied more liberal standards \nto motions for post-judgment amendment at early \nstages in the litigation. For example, the Fifth Circuit \nheld that \u201cthe Rule 15 standards apply when a party \nseeks to amend a judgment that has been entered \nbased on the pleadings,\u201d but doubted whether those \nstandards would apply \u201cafter trial.\u201d S. Constructors \nGrp. v. Dynalectric Co., 2 F.3d 606, 611 (5th Cir. 1993). \nSee also Duggins v. Steak \u2018n Shake, Inc., 195 F.3d 828, \n834 (6th Cir. 1999) (holding that amendment risks sig-\nnificant prejudice \u201cafter the close of discovery\u201d); Ru-\notolo v. City of N.Y., 514 F.3d 184, 187, 192 (2d Cir. \n2008) (similar).  \nPlaintiffs have also yet to be afforded a single \nmeaningful opportunity to amend their complaint; the \nbasis for the original dismissal of the complaint was \nnot merely open to \u201cvigorous debate,\u201d Mandala, 88 \nF.4th at 365, but entirely incorrect; Plaintiffs dili-\ngently prosecuted their case, appealing and moving for \nvacatur expeditiously; and Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed amend-\nments could address the actual defects in the com-\nplaint that the Second Circuit identified.  \nBLOM argues that no extraordinary circumstances \nare present here because (1) the district court\u2019s deci-\nsion was affirmed on the same grounds it provided; (2) \nPlaintiffs waived any \u201cright\u201d to an amendment be-\ncause they did not take the district court\u2019s invitations \nto amend; (3) even if the district court was wrong, a \nclarification or change in law is not an extraordinary \ncircumstance; and (4) Plaintiffs are at \u201cfault\u201d for \n\n \n \n \n \n \n47 \n \nfailing to amend or delaying doing so. Pet.Br.39-45. \nThe first two reasons are addressed above: the dismis-\nsal decision was premised on \u201cthe wrong legal stand-\nard,\u201d and the Second Circuit did not find that Plaintiffs \n\u201cwaived\u201d any meaningful opportunities to amend.  \nBLOM asserts that \u201cmere clarification of the law is \nnot extraordinary,\u201d as it \u201cis what appellate courts do \nday in and day out\u201d\u2014and, in fact, \u201cthis Court has held \nthat even an outright change in the law does not war-\nrant relief under Rule 60(b)(6).\u201d Pet.Br.19 (citing Gon-\nzalez, 545 U.S. at 537). But in Gonzalez, the change in \nlaw was made in another case after the case under re-\nview was decided, leading this Court to remark: \u201c[i]t is \nhardly extraordinary that subsequently, after peti-\ntioner\u2019s case was no longer pending, this Court arrived \nat a different interpretation.\u201d 545 U.S. at 537. Moreo-\nver, Mr. Gonzalez failed to show sufficient diligence \nbecause he did not \u201cseek review of the District Court\u2019s \ndecision\u201d on the issue relating to his vacatur motion. \nId.  \nHere the \u201cclarification\u201d came in the same case, as a \nresult of Plaintiffs\u2019 appeal. See Charles Schwab, 883 \nF.3d at 89-90. The Second Circuit \u201cacknowledge[d] the \ndistrict court\u2019s decision came before our opinion \nin Kaplan [II] clarified the import of our earlier \nJASTA aiding-and-abetting precedents which may \nhave generated some ambiguity as to the proper \nstandard.\u201d Pet.App.40 n.11. It is manifestly unfair to \nexpect Plaintiffs to fully understand a set of legal \nstandards that were still being \u201crecast[],\u201d Oral Arg. at \n13:23-38, when the district court could not. \nBLOM argues in the alternative that if the Second \nCircuit\u2019s clarification was \u201cin line with [Plaintiffs\u2019] \nown interpretation\u201d of JASTA, Plaintiffs \u201cnever \u2018ex-\nplain[ed] why they did not allege facts sufficient to \n\n \n \n \n \n \n48 \n \nsatisfy the standard for which they were advocating.\u2019\u201d \nPet.Br.41 (quoting Pet.App.17 n.5). But while Plain-\ntiffs were indeed broadly correct about JASTA\u2019s plead-\ning standards\u2014a fact that BLOM argues somehow \ncounts against them\u2014they could not anticipate the ev-\nidentiary distinction newly articulated by the Second \nCircuit between \u201cpublicly available evidence\u201d and \n\u201cpublic sources.\u201d \nIn fact, this Court has held that even a change in \nlaw in another case can constitute extraordinary cir-\ncumstances. See Kemp v. United States, 596 U.S. 528, \n540 (2022) (noting \u201cthe availability of Rule 60(b)(6) to \nreopen a judgment in extraordinary circumstances, in-\ncluding a change in controlling law\u201d and citing cases) \n(Sotomayor, J., concurring). For example, a change in \nlaw relating to the same incident justified reversing a \nthree-year-old denial of certiorari, because \u201cthe inter-\nest in finality of litigation must yield where the inter-\nests of justice would make unfair the strict application \nof our rules\u201d\u2014another recitation of the balancing test. \nGondeck v. Pan Am. World Airways, Inc., 382 U.S. 25, \n26-28 (1965). The Tenth Circuit also found such a \nchange in law in another case an \u201cextraordinary situ-\nation justifying Rule 60(b)(6) relief.\u201d Pierce v. Cook & \nCo., 518 F.2d 720, 723-24 (10th Cir. 1975) (en banc). \nThe interests of justice and demands of fairness are \neven more pronounced when the relevant \u201cchange in \nlaw\u201d occurs in the same case.  \nPetitioner\u2019s fourth waiver argument is wrong as \nwell: unlike BLOM\u2019s cases rejecting post-judgment \namendments that were strategically delayed like \nJames and Rozensweig, Plaintiffs here are not at any \n\u201cfault\u201d and did not engage in any \u201cgamesmanship.\u201d \nPet.Br.27, 33, 36, 44. They timely appealed the district \ncourt\u2019s incorrect dismissal decision and, once \u201c[a]rmed \n\n \n \n \n \n \n49 \n \nwith [the Second Circuit\u2019s] clarifications,\u201d promptly \nmoved for vacatur and leave to amend. There was no \n\u201cundue delay\u201d\u2014although \u201cdelay alone, regardless of \nits length is not enough to bar [amendment] if the \nother party is not prejudiced.\u201d Moore v. Paducah, 790 \nF.2d 557, 560 (6th Cir. 1986) (quoting 3 Moore\u2019s Fed-\neral Practice, para. 15.08 at 15.76). As explained \nabove, BLOM would not be unduly prejudiced by vaca-\ntur and amendment here. \nCONCLUSION \nBLOM quotes extensively from Ackermann v. \nUnited States to argue that \u201c\u2018[t]here must be an end to \nlitigation someday . . . .\u201d Pet.Br.1, 29 (quoting 340 U.S. \n193, 198 (1950)). BLOM\u2019s comparison of Ackermann to \nthis case is illustrative of its arguments generally. In \nAckermann, the petitioners sought vacatur four years \nafter judgments were entered following a trial, in or-\nder to bring an extremely late appeal. This case has \nnever even entered discovery. See Dubicz v. Common-\nwealth Edison Co., 377 F.3d 787, 793 n.1 (7th Cir. \n2004) (\u201cIt is important to emphasize that this litiga-\ntion has never progressed beyond the pleadings stage. \nThis is not the case where a plaintiff seeks to amend \nits complaint after the close of discovery or on the eve \nof trial.\u201d). Plaintiffs did file a timely and necessary ap-\npeal. Dismissal here is hardly what this Court in \nAckermann meant by \u201csomeday.\u201d \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be af-\nfirmed and the case should be remanded for further \nproceedings.  \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n50 \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \n \nMichael Radine \n Counsel of Record \nGary M.

Whether the government prioritizes judgment finality (supporting the petitioner) or liberal amendment standards (supporting the respondent) will significantly shift the probability of the Court affirming or reversing. The presence, or even the absence, of such a brief is a critical piece of information for predicting the outcome of this specific case.\n\nDesign EIG (0.8): This action tests a fundamental and highly effective heuristic in SCOTUS prediction: always ascertain the position of the Solicitor General. Successfully using this strategy reinforces its importance and helps calibrate the weight it should be given in the overall prediction model. It's a classic, high-value step that provides strong feedback on a core component of the prediction methodology.\n\nJoint EIG (1.7): The action is highly valuable for both the immediate task and for refining the general prediction strategy.
