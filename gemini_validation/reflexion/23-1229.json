      "Should challenges by small oil refineries seeking exemptions from the requirements of the Clean Air Act\u2019s Renewable Fuel Standard program be heard exclusively in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit because the agency\u2019s denial actions are 'nationally applicable' or 'based on a determination of nationwide scope or effect'?"

    "facts_of_the_case": "Congress amended the Clean Air Act to establish the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program, which requires refiners and importers of transportation fuel to blend increasing amounts of renewable fuels into their products each year. To comply, these companies must either blend renewable fuels themselves or purchase credits called Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) from other companies that do the blending. Recognizing that this might create hardship for small refineries (those processing less than 75,000 barrels of crude oil daily), Congress created three exemptions: an initial blanket exemption through 2011, extensions based on a Department of Energy study, and case-by-case exemptions that small refineries could petition for based on \u201cdisproportionate economic hardship.\u201d\n\nIn 2022, the EPA issued two decisions denying multiple small refinery exemption petitions. The April 2022 decision denied 36 petitions for the 2018 compliance year (including some that had previously been granted in 2019), and the June 2022 decision denied 69 petitions covering the years 2016 through 2021. These denials were based on EPA\u2019s new interpretation that required hardship to be caused solely by RFS compliance costs and its \u201cRIN passthrough\u201d economic theory. The affected refineries challenged these denials as impermissibly retroactive, contrary to law, and arbitrary and capricious.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit vacated the EPA\u2019s adjudications, denied a change of venue to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, and remanded, based on its conclusion that the denial was (1) impermissibly retroactive; (2) contrary to law; and (3) counter to the record evidence.",

By deciding to start with the petitioner's (EPA's) arguments, the agent is directly targeting the information that will form one half of the core legal dispute. This structured approach ensures that subsequent searches will be highly relevant and efficient, directly contributing to a well-reasoned prediction.\n\nDesign EIG is also high (0.7) because this action exemplifies a robust and generalizable strategy for legal analysis: 1) Isolate the precise legal question. 2) Identify the controlling statute. 3) Formulate a plan to analyze the primary arguments of each party, starting with their main briefs. This methodical, top-down approach is a cornerstone of effective legal reasoning and serves as an excellent design pattern for the agent's overall prediction methodology.",

Six of those refineries petitioned \nfor review of EPA\u2019s decisions in the Fifth Circuit, which \ndenied the government\u2019s motion to transfer the peti-\ntions to the D.C. Circuit.  The question presented is as \nfollows: \nWhether venue for the refineries\u2019 challenges lies ex-\nclusively in the D.C. Circuit because the denial actions \nare \u201cnationally applicable\u201d or, alternatively, are \u201cbased \non a determination of nationwide scope or effect.\u201d  42 \nU.S.C. 7607(b)(1). \n \n \n\n(III) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage\nOpinion below ................................................................................ 1 \nJurisdiction .................................................................................... 1 \nStatutory provisions involved ...................................................... 1 \nStatement: \nA. \nLegal background ............................................................ 2 \nB. \nFacts and proceedings below ......................................... 6 \nSummary of argument ............................................................... 14 \nArgument: \nThe D.C.

App. 1a-43a) \nis reported at 86 F.4th 1121. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nNovember 22, 2023.  Petitions for rehearing were de-\nnied on January 22, 2024 (Pet. App. 331a-333a).  On April \n11, 2024, Justice Alito extended the time within which \nto file a petition for a writ of certiorari to and including \nMay 21, 2024.  The petition for a writ of certiorari was \nfiled on May 20, 2024, and was granted on October 21, \n2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court rests on 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent statutory provisions are reprinted in the \nappendix.  App., infra, 1a-32a. \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal Background \n1. When a petitioner seeks review of a \u201cfinal action\u201d \ntaken by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \nunder the Clean Air Act (CAA), 42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq., \nSection 7607(b)(1) of Title 42 provides for direct court \nof appeals review of the petitioner\u2019s challenge.  To de-\ntermine which circuit has exclusive venue over the chal-\nlenge, Section 7607(b)(1) separates EPA\u2019s final actions \ninto three categories.  First, challenges to certain spec-\nified actions or to \u201cany other nationally applicable reg-\nulations promulgated, or final action taken,\u201d must be \nfiled \u201conly in the United States Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  Second, \nchallenges to actions that are \u201clocally or regionally ap-\nplicable may be filed only in the United States Court of \nAppeals for the appropriate circuit.\u201d  Ibid.  Third, \n\u201c[n]otwithstanding\u201d the sentence directing review of lo-\ncally or regionally applicable actions to \u201cthe appropri-\nate circuit,\u201d challenges to such locally or regionally ap-\nplicable actions \u201cmay be filed only in the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia if such ac-\ntion is based on a determination of nationwide scope or \neffect and if in taking such action the Administrator \nfinds and publishes that such action is based on such a \ndetermination.\u201d  Ibid.   \nCongress adopted this three-prong structure in \n1977.  See Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977, Pub. L. \nNo. 95, 91 Stat. 776.  The predecessor to Section \n7607(b)(1) had provided for direct court of appeals re-\nview only of certain specifically enumerated EPA ac-\ntions.  42 U.S.C. 1857h-5(b)(1) (1970).  EPA actions in-\nvolving \u201cnational primary or secondary ambient air \nquality standard[s],\u201d \u201cemission standard[s],\u201d or other \n\n3 \n \nspecified standards or controls were reviewable only in \nthe D.C. Circuit, while EPA\u2019s actions \u201cin approving or \npromulgating\u201d a state or federal \u201cimplementation plan\u201d \nwere reviewable only in \u201cthe appropriate circuit.\u201d  Ibid.  \nThat division reflected Congress\u2019s view that EPA ac-\ntions that are \u201cnational in scope\u201d should receive \u201ceven \nand consistent national application,\u201d which would be ac-\ncomplished through centralized D.C. Circuit review.   \nS. Rep. No. 1196, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 41 (1970) (1970 \nSenate Report).  By contrast, Congress viewed EPA ac-\ntions approving or promulgating \u201cimplementation plans \nwhich run only to one air quality control region\u201d as ap-\npropriately reviewed \u201cin the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Circuit in which the affected air quality control re-\ngion, or portion thereof, is located.\u201d  Ibid.  At that time, \nthe venue provision did not include a catchall for other \nnationally or locally or regionally applicable actions, nor \ndid the provision specifically reference EPA actions \nthat are based on a determination of nationwide scope \nor effect.  Rather, final actions that the CAA venue pro-\nvision did not specifically address were reviewable only \nby a district court exercising federal-question jurisdic-\ntion.  See Harrison v. PPG Industries, Inc., 446 U.S. \n578, 584 (1980).   \nIn 1977, Congress amended the statute to authorize \ndirect court of appeals review of all EPA \u201cfinal actions\u201d \nunder the CAA.  Congress achieved that result by add-\ning the catchall categories for the first two subsets of \nfinal actions, and by adding the third category of locally \nor regionally applicable actions that are based on a de-\ntermination of nationwide scope or effect.  The House \nReport accompanying the amendment explained that \nthe revision would \u201cprovide[] for essentially locally, \nstatewide, or regionally applicable rules or orders to be \n\n4 \n \nreviewed in the U.S. court of appeals for the circuit in \nwhich such locality, State, or region is located.\u201d  H.R. \nRep. No. 294, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 323 (1977) (1977 \nHouse Report).  \u201cOn the other hand,\u201d the report ex-\nplained, venue would lie only in the D.C. Circuit \u201cif an \naction of the Administrator is found by him to be based \non a determination of nationwide scope or effect (includ-\ning a determination which has scope or effect beyond a \nsingle judicial circuit).\u201d  Id. at 324.   \n2. The EPA actions at issue in this case involve the \nRenewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program, a CAA pro-\ngram that generally requires transportation fuel sold or \nintroduced into commerce in the United States to con-\ntain specified volumes of renewable fuel.  See 42 U.S.C. \n7545(o)(2)(A)(i) and (B)(i).  To implement the program, \nEPA expresses renewable-fuel targets as a percentage \nof the gasoline and diesel fuel that is projected to be sold \nin the upcoming year, and the agency adopts regulations \nto ensure compliance.  See 42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(2)(A)(i); see \nalso 42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(3).  Obligated parties \u201cuse that \nannual-percentage standard to determine their volume \nobligations\u201d for the year.  Pet. App. 3a.  Each obligated \nparty\u2019s renewable-fuel-volume obligation is propor-\ntional to its annual production or importation of gaso-\nline and diesel fuel.   \nEPA\u2019s implementing regulations identify refineries \nand importers of gasoline and diesel as obligated parties \nsubject to RFS requirements.  40 C.F.R. 80.2, 80.1406.  \nTo track whether an obligated party has satisfied RFS \nprogram requirements, EPA uses a credit system that \noffers parties flexibility in achieving compliance.  See 42 \nU.S.C. 7545(o)(5).  Producers and importers of renewa-\nble fuels generate credits\u2014called Renewable Identifi-\ncation Numbers (RINs)\u2014for each gallon of renewable \n\n5 \n \nfuel they produce or import for use in the United States.  \n40 C.F.R. 80.1426(a).  The producers and importers as-\nsign a RIN to each batch of renewable fuel.  40 C.F.R. \n80.1426(e).  A RIN may be used after it is \u201cseparated\u201d \nfrom its batch by an obligated party or by an entity that \nblends the renewable fuel into gasoline or diesel.  40 \nC.F.R. 80.1429(b).  Once separated, RINs may be kept \nfor compliance or sold.  40 C.F.R. 80.1425-80.1429.  Each \nyear, a refinery may generate its own credits by blend-\ning renewable fuel into transportation fuel, or it may \npurchase the requisite number of credits.  See Pet. App. \n206a-207a; see also 42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(5)(B) and (E); 40 \nC.F.R. 80.1428(b), 80.1429(b). \nObligated parties meet their renewable-fuel-volume \nobligations by \u201cretir[ing]\u201d RINs in an annual compli-\nance demonstration.  40 C.F.R. 80.1427(a)(1).  A refin-\nery may use a particular RIN only during the calendar \nyear in which it was generated or in the following calen-\ndar year.  40 C.F.R. 80.1427(a)(6), 80.1428(c).  An obli-\ngated party who fails to demonstrate full compliance in \none year may carry forward a compliance deficit to the \nfollowing year.  42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(5)(D).  \nCongress created a three-tiered scheme through \nwhich obligated parties that qualify as \u201c[s]mall refiner-\nies\u201d may obtain exemptions from RFS program require-\nments.  42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9) (emphasis omitted); see 42 \nU.S.C. 7545(o)(1)(k) (defining \u201csmall refinery\u201d).   \nFirst, Congress granted all small refineries a blan-\nket exemption until 2011.  42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(A)(i). \nSecond, Congress directed the U.S. Department of \nEnergy (DOE) to study \u201cwhether compliance with the \nrequirements of [the RFS program] would impose a dis-\nproportionate economic hardship on small refineries.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(A)(ii)(I).  For any small refinery \n\n6 \n \nthat DOE determined \u201cwould be subject to a dispropor-\ntionate economic hardship if required to comply,\u201d Con-\ngress directed EPA to extend the exemption for at least \ntwo years.  42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(A)(ii)(II). \nThird, Congress established a mechanism through \nwhich a small refinery \u201cmay at any time petition [EPA] \nfor an extension of the exemption under subparagraph \n(A) for the reason of disproportionate economic hard-\nship.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(B)(i).  In evaluating a peti-\ntion for such an exemption, EPA, \u201cin consultation with\u201d \nDOE, \u201cshall consider the findings of [DOE\u2019s study] and \nother economic factors.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(B)(ii). \nB. Facts And Proceedings Below \n1. In August 2019, EPA issued a single decision act-\ning on 36 exemption petitions filed by small refineries \nfor the 2018 compliance year, granting 31 petitions and \ndenying five.  See C.A. App. 2928.  Multiple parties pe-\ntitioned for review of the action in the D.C. Circuit.  See \nSinclair Wyoming Ref. Co. v. EPA, No. 19-1196; Big \nWest Oil, LLC v. EPA, No. 19-1197; Renewable Fuels \nAss\u2019n v. EPA, No. 19-1220; Kern Oil & Ref. Co. v. EPA, \nNo. 19-1216; Wynnewood Ref. Co. v. EPA, No. 20-1099.   \nWhile those challenges were pending, the Tenth Cir-\ncuit issued a decision vacating and remanding three \nEPA orders granting three exemption petitions for the \n2016 and 2017 compliance years.  Renewable Fuels Ass\u2019n \nv. EPA, 948 F.3d 1206, 1258 (2020).  The court held that \na small refinery is eligible for an extension of an exemp-\ntion only if it has maintained a continuous, uninter-\nrupted exemption, id. at 1245-1249; that \u201crenewable \nfuels compliance must be the cause of any dispropor-\ntionate hardship\u201d in order for an exemption to be avail-\nable, id. at 1253; and that EPA had \u201c\u200a\u2018failed to consider \nan important aspect of the problem\u2019\u200a\u201d when it did not ad-\n\n7 \n \ndress whether refiners could \u201cpass RIN costs on to cus-\ntomers,\u201d id. at 1257 (citation omitted).  This Court \ngranted a petition for a writ of certiorari limited to the \nfirst of those Tenth Circuit holdings.  HollyFrontier \nCheyenne Ref., LLC v. Renewable Fuels Ass\u2019n, 141  \nS. Ct. 974 (2021).  Pending this Court\u2019s resolution of \nHollyFrontier, the D.C. Circuit granted EPA\u2019s motion \nto hold in abeyance the petitions for review that had \nbeen filed in that court. See Sinclair Wyoming Ref. Co. \nv. EPA, No. 19-1196, Doc. 1883334 (Feb. 2, 2021); p. 6, \nsupra.   \nThis Court reversed the Tenth Circuit decision in \nHollyFrontier, holding that a small refinery may be el-\nigible for an exemption renewal even if the refinery had \nallowed a prior exemption to lapse.  HollyFrontier \nCheyenne Ref., LLC v. Renewable Fuels Ass\u2019n, 594 U.S. \n382, 390 (2021).  In the pending D.C. Circuit proceed-\nings, EPA then moved for a voluntary remand without \nvacatur to allow the agency to reconsider its action on \nthe 2018 exemption petitions in light of this Court\u2019s de-\ncision in HollyFrontier, and in light of the Tenth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s analysis in Renewable Fuels Association of addi-\ntional issues this Court had not reached.  See Sinclair \nWyoming Ref. Co., No. 19-1196, Doc. 1911606 (Aug. 25, \n2021).  The D.C. Circuit granted that motion and in-\nstructed EPA to act on the petitions within 120 days.  \nSinclair Wyoming Ref. Co., No. 19-1196, Doc. 1925942 \n(Dec. 8, 2021).   \n2. In December 2021, EPA proposed to deny all \npending small refinery exemption petitions.  86 Fed. \nReg. 70,999 (Dec. 14, 2021); see C.A. App. 520-585.  \nSeeking to create a nationally uniform program, EPA \nproposed to adopt the Tenth Circuit\u2019s reasoning in Re-\nnewable Fuels Association on the issues this Court had \n\n8 \n \nnot considered.  Under that approach, EPA proposed to \ninterpret the pertinent statutory provisions as requir-\ning small refineries seeking exemptions to show that \nRFS compliance itself caused a disproportionate eco-\nnomic hardship.  C.A. App. 545-548.  In accordance with \nthe Tenth Circuit\u2019s analysis, EPA also analyzed whether \nrefineries were able to pass on the costs of RFS compli-\nance to consumers.  The agency concluded that the evi-\ndence supported a rebuttable presumption that such \ncosts \u201care fully passed through to consumers,\u201d so that \nsmall refineries ordinarily would not suffer dispropor-\ntionate economic hardship as a result of RFS compli-\nance.  Id. at 549; see id. at 548-584.  In light of those \nconclusions, EPA proposed to deny all the pending ex-\nemption petitions and sought comment on that pro-\nposed decision.   \nAfter the comment period ended, EPA took two ac-\ntions.  In April 2022\u2014the deadline set by the D.C. Cir-\ncuit to resolve the remanded petitions\u2014EPA denied 36 \nexemption petitions filed by small refineries for the \n2018 compliance year.  Pet. App. 193a; see April 2022 \nDenial of Petitions for Small Refinery Exemptions \nUnder the Renewable Fuel Standard Program, 87 Fed. \nReg. 24,300 (Apr. 25, 2022) (April Notice).  In June \n2022, EPA denied an additional 69 petitions for the \n2016-2021 compliance years.  Pet. App. 48a; see Notice \nof June 2022 Denial of Petitions for Small Refinery Ex-\nemptions Under the Renewable Fuel Standard Pro-\ngram, 87 Fed. Reg. 34,873, 34,874 (June 8, 2022) (June \nNotice).  The two denial actions reflect the same reason-\ning and are based on two principal rationales, one stat-\nutory and one economic.1  The denial actions contain ex-\n \n1  For ease of reference, this brief cites only the April 2022 denial \nwhen discussing reasoning common to both actions. \n\n9 \n \nplicit agency findings that the actions are nationally ap-\nplicable or, in the alternative, that they are based on de-\nterminations of nationwide scope or effect. \nStatutory interpretation.  In the April and June 2022 \ndenial actions, EPA concluded that an extension of the \nsmall refinery exemption under the relevant provisions \nmay be granted only if disproportionate economic hard-\nship was \u201ccaused by RFS compliance.\u201d  Pet. App. 242a.  \nFor relevant context, the agency turned to paragraph \n(A) of 42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9), which established the initial \nblanket exemption for small refineries and the two-year \nextension based on the DOE study.  See 42 U.S.C. \n7545(o)(9)(A) and (B).  The agency observed that para-\ngraph (A) focuses on \u201cwhether compliance with the re-\nquirements of [the RFS program] would impose a [dis-\nproportionate economic hardship] on small refineries.\u201d  \nPet. App. 243a (quoting 42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(A)(ii)(I)).  \nBecause paragraph (B) provides for an extension of the \nexemption provided by paragraph (A), EPA construed \nparagraph (B)\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n15: 20241213185250767_Certificate20-2023-122920-20EPA20v.20Calumet20Shreveport20Refining20LLC.json (score: 0.466)\nNo. 23-1229 \n \n \nIN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES \n _________________ \n \nENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY, PETITIONER \n \nv. \n \nCALUMET SHREVEPORT REFINING, L.L.C., ET AL. \n_________________ \n \n \n \n \nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE \n \n \nIt is hereby certified that all parties required to be served have been served with copies of the \nBRIEF FOR THE PETITIONER, via email and first-class mail, postage prepaid, this 13th day of \nDecember 2024. \n \n[See Attached Service List] \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs required by Supreme Court Rule 33.1(h), I certify that the document contains 12,158 words, \nexcluding the parts of the document that are exempted by Supreme Court Rule 33.1(d).

Six of those refineries petitioned \nfor review of EPA\u2019s decisions in the Fifth Circuit, which \ndenied the government\u2019s motion to transfer the peti-\ntions to the D.C. Circuit.  The question presented is as \nfollows: \nWhether venue for the refineries\u2019 challenges lies ex-\nclusively in the D.C. Circuit because the denial actions \nare \u201cnationally applicable\u201d or, alternatively, are \u201cbased \non a determination of nationwide scope or effect.\u201d  42 \nU.S.C. 7607(b)(1). \n \n \n\n(III) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage\nOpinion below ................................................................................ 1 \nJurisdiction .................................................................................... 1 \nStatutory provisions involved ...................................................... 1 \nStatement: \nA. \nLegal background ............................................................ 2 \nB. \nFacts and proceedings below ......................................... 6 \nSummary of argument ............................................................... 14 \nArgument: \nThe D.C.

Petitions for rehearing were de-\nnied on January 22, 2024 (Pet. App. 331a-333a).  On April \n11, 2024, Justice Alito extended the time within which \nto file a petition for a writ of certiorari to and including \nMay 21, 2024.  The petition for a writ of certiorari was \nfiled on May 20, 2024, and was granted on October 21, \n2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court rests on 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent statutory provisions are reprinted in the \nappendix.  App., infra, 1a-32a. \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal Background \n1. When a petitioner seeks review of a \u201cfinal action\u201d \ntaken by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \nunder the Clean Air Act (CAA), 42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq., \nSection 7607(b)(1) of Title 42 provides for direct court \nof appeals review of the petitioner\u2019s challenge.  To de-\ntermine which circuit has exclusive venue over the chal-\nlenge, Section 7607(b)(1) separates EPA\u2019s final actions \ninto three categories.  First, challenges to certain spec-\nified actions or to \u201cany other nationally applicable reg-\nulations promulgated, or final action taken,\u201d must be \nfiled \u201conly in the United States Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  Second, \nchallenges to actions that are \u201clocally or regionally ap-\nplicable may be filed only in the United States Court of \nAppeals for the appropriate circuit.\u201d  Ibid.  Third, \n\u201c[n]otwithstanding\u201d the sentence directing review of lo-\ncally or regionally applicable actions to \u201cthe appropri-\nate circuit,\u201d challenges to such locally or regionally ap-\nplicable actions \u201cmay be filed only in the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia if such ac-\ntion is based on a determination of nationwide scope or \neffect and if in taking such action the Administrator \nfinds and publishes that such action is based on such a \ndetermination.\u201d  Ibid.   \nCongress adopted this three-prong structure in \n1977.  See Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977, Pub. L. \nNo. 95, 91 Stat. 776.  The predecessor to Section \n7607(b)(1) had provided for direct court of appeals re-\nview only of certain specifically enumerated EPA ac-\ntions.  42 U.S.C. 1857h-5(b)(1) (1970).  EPA actions in-\nvolving \u201cnational primary or secondary ambient air \nquality standard[s],\u201d \u201cemission standard[s],\u201d or other \n\n3 \n \nspecified standards or controls were reviewable only in \nthe D.C. Circuit, while EPA\u2019s actions \u201cin approving or \npromulgating\u201d a state or federal \u201cimplementation plan\u201d \nwere reviewable only in \u201cthe appropriate circuit.\u201d  Ibid.  \nThat division reflected Congress\u2019s view that EPA ac-\ntions that are \u201cnational in scope\u201d should receive \u201ceven \nand consistent national application,\u201d which would be ac-\ncomplished through centralized D.C. Circuit review.   \nS. Rep. No. 1196, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 41 (1970) (1970 \nSenate Report).  By contrast, Congress viewed EPA ac-\ntions approving or promulgating \u201cimplementation plans \nwhich run only to one air quality control region\u201d as ap-\npropriately reviewed \u201cin the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Circuit in which the affected air quality control re-\ngion, or portion thereof, is located.\u201d  Ibid.  At that time, \nthe venue provision did not include a catchall for other \nnationally or locally or regionally applicable actions, nor \ndid the provision specifically reference EPA actions \nthat are based on a determination of nationwide scope \nor effect.  Rather, final actions that the CAA venue pro-\nvision did not specifically address were reviewable only \nby a district court exercising federal-question jurisdic-\ntion.  See Harrison v. PPG Industries, Inc., 446 U.S. \n578, 584 (1980).   \nIn 1977, Congress amended the statute to authorize \ndirect court of appeals review of all EPA \u201cfinal actions\u201d \nunder the CAA.  Congress achieved that result by add-\ning the catchall categories for the first two subsets of \nfinal actions, and by adding the third category of locally \nor regionally applicable actions that are based on a de-\ntermination of nationwide scope or effect.  The House \nReport accompanying the amendment explained that \nthe revision would \u201cprovide[] for essentially locally, \nstatewide, or regionally applicable rules or orders to be \n\n4 \n \nreviewed in the U.S. court of appeals for the circuit in \nwhich such locality, State, or region is located.\u201d  H.R. \nRep. No. 294, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 323 (1977) (1977 \nHouse Report).  \u201cOn the other hand,\u201d the report ex-\nplained, venue would lie only in the D.C. Circuit \u201cif an \naction of the Administrator is found by him to be based \non a determination of nationwide scope or effect (includ-\ning a determination which has scope or effect beyond a \nsingle judicial circuit).\u201d  Id. at 324.   \n2. The EPA actions at issue in this case involve the \nRenewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program, a CAA pro-\ngram that generally requires transportation fuel sold or \nintroduced into commerce in the United States to con-\ntain specified volumes of renewable fuel.  See 42 U.S.C. \n7545(o)(2)(A)(i) and (B)(i).  To implement the program, \nEPA expresses renewable-fuel targets as a percentage \nof the gasoline and diesel fuel that is projected to be sold \nin the upcoming year, and the agency adopts regulations \nto ensure compliance.  See 42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(2)(A)(i); see \nalso 42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(3).  Obligated parties \u201cuse that \nannual-percentage standard to determine their volume \nobligations\u201d for the year.  Pet. App. 3a.  Each obligated \nparty\u2019s renewable-fuel-volume obligation is propor-\ntional to its annual production or importation of gaso-\nline and diesel fuel.   \nEPA\u2019s implementing regulations identify refineries \nand importers of gasoline and diesel as obligated parties \nsubject to RFS requirements.  40 C.F.R. 80.2, 80.1406.  \nTo track whether an obligated party has satisfied RFS \nprogram requirements, EPA uses a credit system that \noffers parties flexibility in achieving compliance.  See 42 \nU.S.C. 7545(o)(5).  Producers and importers of renewa-\nble fuels generate credits\u2014called Renewable Identifi-\ncation Numbers (RINs)\u2014for each gallon of renewable \n\n5 \n \nfuel they produce or import for use in the United States.  \n40 C.F.R. 80.1426(a).  The producers and importers as-\nsign a RIN to each batch of renewable fuel.  40 C.F.R. \n80.1426(e).  A RIN may be used after it is \u201cseparated\u201d \nfrom its batch by an obligated party or by an entity that \nblends the renewable fuel into gasoline or diesel.  40 \nC.F.R. 80.1429(b).  Once separated, RINs may be kept \nfor compliance or sold.  40 C.F.R. 80.1425-80.1429.  Each \nyear, a refinery may generate its own credits by blend-\ning renewable fuel into transportation fuel, or it may \npurchase the requisite number of credits.  See Pet. App. \n206a-207a; see also 42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(5)(B) and (E); 40 \nC.F.R. 80.1428(b), 80.1429(b). \nObligated parties meet their renewable-fuel-volume \nobligations by \u201cretir[ing]\u201d RINs in an annual compli-\nance demonstration.  40 C.F.R. 80.1427(a)(1).  A refin-\nery may use a particular RIN only during the calendar \nyear in which it was generated or in the following calen-\ndar year.  40 C.F.R. 80.1427(a)(6), 80.1428(c).  An obli-\ngated party who fails to demonstrate full compliance in \none year may carry forward a compliance deficit to the \nfollowing year.  42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(5)(D).  \nCongress created a three-tiered scheme through \nwhich obligated parties that qualify as \u201c[s]mall refiner-\nies\u201d may obtain exemptions from RFS program require-\nments.  42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9) (emphasis omitted); see 42 \nU.S.C. 7545(o)(1)(k) (defining \u201csmall refinery\u201d).   \nFirst, Congress granted all small refineries a blan-\nket exemption until 2011.  42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(A)(i). \nSecond, Congress directed the U.S. Department of \nEnergy (DOE) to study \u201cwhether compliance with the \nrequirements of [the RFS program] would impose a dis-\nproportionate economic hardship on small refineries.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(A)(ii)(I).  For any small refinery \n\n6 \n \nthat DOE determined \u201cwould be subject to a dispropor-\ntionate economic hardship if required to comply,\u201d Con-\ngress directed EPA to extend the exemption for at least \ntwo years.  42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(A)(ii)(II). \nThird, Congress established a mechanism through \nwhich a small refinery \u201cmay at any time petition [EPA] \nfor an extension of the exemption under subparagraph \n(A) for the reason of disproportionate economic hard-\nship.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(B)(i).  In evaluating a peti-\ntion for such an exemption, EPA, \u201cin consultation with\u201d \nDOE, \u201cshall consider the findings of [DOE\u2019s study] and \nother economic factors.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(B)(ii). \nB. Facts And Proceedings Below \n1. In August 2019, EPA issued a single decision act-\ning on 36 exemption petitions filed by small refineries \nfor the 2018 compliance year, granting 31 petitions and \ndenying five.  See C.A. App. 2928.  Multiple parties pe-\ntitioned for review of the action in the D.C. Circuit.  See \nSinclair Wyoming Ref. Co. v. EPA, No. 19-1196; Big \nWest Oil, LLC v. EPA, No. 19-1197; Renewable Fuels \nAss\u2019n v. EPA, No. 19-1220; Kern Oil & Ref. Co. v. EPA, \nNo. 19-1216; Wynnewood Ref. Co. v. EPA, No. 20-1099.   \nWhile those challenges were pending, the Tenth Cir-\ncuit issued a decision vacating and remanding three \nEPA orders granting three exemption petitions for the \n2016 and 2017 compliance years.  Renewable Fuels Ass\u2019n \nv. EPA, 948 F.3d 1206, 1258 (2020).  The court held that \na small refinery is eligible for an extension of an exemp-\ntion only if it has maintained a continuous, uninter-\nrupted exemption, id. at 1245-1249; that \u201crenewable \nfuels compliance must be the cause of any dispropor-\ntionate hardship\u201d in order for an exemption to be avail-\nable, id. at 1253; and that EPA had \u201c\u200a\u2018failed to consider \nan important aspect of the problem\u2019\u200a\u201d when it did not ad-\n\n7 \n \ndress whether refiners could \u201cpass RIN costs on to cus-\ntomers,\u201d id. at 1257 (citation omitted).  This Court \ngranted a petition for a writ of certiorari limited to the \nfirst of those Tenth Circuit holdings.  HollyFrontier \nCheyenne Ref., LLC v. Renewable Fuels Ass\u2019n, 141  \nS. Ct. 974 (2021).  Pending this Court\u2019s resolution of \nHollyFrontier, the D.C. Circuit granted EPA\u2019s motion \nto hold in abeyance the petitions for review that had \nbeen filed in that court. See Sinclair Wyoming Ref. Co. \nv. EPA, No. 19-1196, Doc. 1883334 (Feb. 2, 2021); p. 6, \nsupra.   \nThis Court reversed the Tenth Circuit decision in \nHollyFrontier, holding that a small refinery may be el-\nigible for an exemption renewal even if the refinery had \nallowed a prior exemption to lapse.  HollyFrontier \nCheyenne Ref., LLC v. Renewable Fuels Ass\u2019n, 594 U.S. \n382, 390 (2021).  In the pending D.C. Circuit proceed-\nings, EPA then moved for a voluntary remand without \nvacatur to allow the agency to reconsider its action on \nthe 2018 exemption petitions in light of this Court\u2019s de-\ncision in HollyFrontier, and in light of the Tenth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s analysis in Renewable Fuels Association of addi-\ntional issues this Court had not reached.  See Sinclair \nWyoming Ref. Co., No. 19-1196, Doc. 1911606 (Aug. 25, \n2021).  The D.C. Circuit granted that motion and in-\nstructed EPA to act on the petitions within 120 days.  \nSinclair Wyoming Ref. Co., No. 19-1196, Doc. 1925942 \n(Dec. 8, 2021).   \n2. In December 2021, EPA proposed to deny all \npending small refinery exemption petitions.  86 Fed. \nReg. 70,999 (Dec. 14, 2021); see C.A. App. 520-585.  \nSeeking to create a nationally uniform program, EPA \nproposed to adopt the Tenth Circuit\u2019s reasoning in Re-\nnewable Fuels Association on the issues this Court had \n\n8 \n \nnot considered.  Under that approach, EPA proposed to \ninterpret the pertinent statutory provisions as requir-\ning small refineries seeking exemptions to show that \nRFS compliance itself caused a disproportionate eco-\nnomic hardship.  C.A. App. 545-548.  In accordance with \nthe Tenth Circuit\u2019s analysis, EPA also analyzed whether \nrefineries were able to pass on the costs of RFS compli-\nance to consumers.  The agency concluded that the evi-\ndence supported a rebuttable presumption that such \ncosts \u201care fully passed through to consumers,\u201d so that \nsmall refineries ordinarily would not suffer dispropor-\ntionate economic hardship as a result of RFS compli-\nance.  Id. at 549; see id. at 548-584.  In light of those \nconclusions, EPA proposed to deny all the pending ex-\nemption petitions and sought comment on that pro-\nposed decision.   \nAfter the comment period ended, EPA took two ac-\ntions.  In April 2022\u2014the deadline set by the D.C. Cir-\ncuit to resolve the remanded petitions\u2014EPA denied 36 \nexemption petitions filed by small refineries for the \n2018 compliance year.  Pet. App. 193a; see April 2022 \nDenial of Petitions for Small Refinery Exemptions \nUnder the Renewable Fuel Standard Program, 87 Fed. \nReg. 24,300 (Apr. 25, 2022) (April Notice).  In June \n2022, EPA denied an additional 69 petitions for the \n2016-2021 compliance years.  Pet. App. 48a; see Notice \nof June 2022 Denial of Petitions for Small Refinery Ex-\nemptions Under the Renewable Fuel Standard Pro-\ngram, 87 Fed. Reg. 34,873, 34,874 (June 8, 2022) (June \nNotice).  The two denial actions reflect the same reason-\ning and are based on two principal rationales, one stat-\nutory and one economic.1  The denial actions contain ex-\n \n1  For ease of reference, this brief cites only the April 2022 denial \nwhen discussing reasoning common to both actions. \n\n9 \n \nplicit agency findings that the actions are nationally ap-\nplicable or, in the alternative, that they are based on de-\nterminations of nationwide scope or effect. \nStatutory interpretation.  In the April and June 2022 \ndenial actions, EPA concluded that an extension of the \nsmall refinery exemption under the relevant provisions \nmay be granted only if disproportionate economic hard-\nship was \u201ccaused by RFS compliance.\u201d  Pet. App. 242a.  \nFor relevant context, the agency turned to paragraph \n(A) of 42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9), which established the initial \nblanket exemption for small refineries and the two-year \nextension based on the DOE study.  See 42 U.S.C. \n7545(o)(9)(A) and (B).  The agency observed that para-\ngraph (A) focuses on \u201cwhether compliance with the re-\nquirements of [the RFS program] would impose a [dis-\nproportionate economic hardship] on small refineries.\u201d  \nPet. App. 243a (quoting 42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(A)(ii)(I)).  \nBecause paragraph (B) provides for an extension of the \nexemption provided by paragraph (A), EPA construed \nparagraph (B) to require a similar causal connection be-\ntween RFS compliance and any resulting economic \nhardship.  Id. at 245a.  The agency found it \u201chard to im-\nagine that Congress intended\u201d to permit exemptions for \nhardships resulting from \u201ca broad array of circum-\nstances unrelated to the RFS program.\u201d  Id. at 247a. \nEconomic analysis.  In implementing the RFS pro-\ngram, EPA has made \u201clongstanding and consistent \nfindings\u201d that obligated parties can pass the costs of \nRFS compliance on to purchasers, a phenomenon called \nRIN cost passthrough.  Pet. App. 248a; see, e.g., Alon \nRef. Krotz Springs, Inc. v. EPA, 936 F.3d 628, 649-650 \n(D.C. Cir. 2019) (per curiam) (discussing earlier studies \nreaching this conclusion), cert. denied, 140 S. Ct. 2792 \n(2020).  In the April and June 2022 denial actions, EPA \n\n10 \n \nreassessed and reaffirmed those prior findings.  Pet. \nApp. 248a-303a; see id. at 240a-241a (explaining related \nconcept of \u201cRIN discount\u201d).  After reviewing extensive \nmarket data, the agency determined that \u201call obligated \nparties recover the cost of acquiring RINs by selling the \ngasoline and diesel fuel they produce at the market \nprice, which reflects these RIN costs.\u201d  Id. at 249a.  EPA \nfurther concluded that \u201cRINs are generally widely \navailable in an open and liquid market,\u201d and that the \n\u201ccost of acquiring RINs is the same for all parties.\u201d  \nIbid. \nGiven that all refineries bear the same costs of RFS \ncompliance and can recover those costs by selling at \nmarket price, EPA found that such costs presumptively \ndo not cause disproportionate economic hardship to any \nsmall refinery.  Pet. App. 248a-250a.  EPA determined \nthat none of the petitioning small refineries had rebut-\nted that presumption through evidence about their spe-\ncific circumstances.  Id. at 251a-252a; see id. at 305a-\n310a. \nVenue.  EPA determined that the denial actions are \nsubject to review exclusively in the D.C. Circuit because \nthey are \u201c\u200a\u2018nationally applicable\u2019\u200a\u201d or, in the alternative, \nbecause they are \u201cbased on a determination of \u2018nation-\nwide scope or effect.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. 328a; id. at 187a (same \nfor June 2022 denial action); see April Notice, 87 Fed. \nReg. at 24,300-24,301; June Notice, 87 Fed. Reg. at \n34,874.  The agency explained that the April 2022 denial \naction encompasses petitions from more than 30 small \nrefineries located within 18 States in seven of the ten \nEPA regions and in eight different federal judicial cir-\ncuits.  Pet. App. 329a; see id. at 187a (similar for June \ndenial).  The agency further observed that the denial \nactions are \u201cbased on EPA\u2019s revised interpretation of \n\n11 \n \nthe relevant CAA provisions and the  * * *  RIN cost \npassthrough principles that are applicable to all small \nrefineries no matter the location or market in which \nthey operate.\u201d  Id. at 329a; see id. at 187a-188a. \n3. Six small refineries filed petitions for review in \nthe Fifth Circuit, collectively challenging both denial \nactions.  Pet. App. 2a, 6a.  Various renewable-fuel trade \nassociations were granted leave to intervene as respond-\nents.  See 22-60266 C.A. Doc. 303-1 (Mar. 16, 2023).  The \ncourt granted the petitions for review, vacated the de-\nnial actions as to the six petitioners, and remanded to \nEPA for further proceedings.  Pet. App. 1a-34a. \na. The court of appeals denied EPA\u2019s motion to trans-\nfer the petitions to the D.C. Circuit.  Pet. App. 9a-15a.  \nThe court held that the denial actions are \u201clocally or re-\ngionally applicable\u201d rather than \u201cnationally applicable,\u201d \n42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1), because the actions\u2019 \u201clegal effect\u201d \nis limited to the petitioning refineries, and the actions \ndo not \u201cbind[\u200a] EPA in any future adjudication,\u201d Pet. \nApp. 11a-12a (emphases omitted).   \nThe court of appeals further held that neither denial \naction is \u201cbased on a determination of nationwide scope \nor effect.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  The court acknowl-\nedged, but disagreed with, EPA\u2019s express finding that \nthe denial actions were based on such determinations.  \nPet. App. 12a-14a.  The court noted that, under EPA\u2019s \ninterpretation of the relevant provisions, the agency \nwill review refinery-specific information to determine \nwhether there is any basis to depart from EPA\u2019s gen-\neral conclusions about market conditions and RIN \npassthrough.  Id. at 15a.  The court of appeals concluded \nthat, because \u201cthere is still a non-zero chance [EPA] will \ngrant small refinery petitions\u201d based on \u201cdata and evi-\ndence\u201d about particular refineries\u2019 circumstances, \u201cthe \n\n12 \n \nDenial Actions rely on refinery-specific determinations \nand are not based on a determination of nationwide \nscope or effect.\u201d  Ibid. \nOn the merits, the Fifth Circuit held the denial ac-\ntions unlawful on three grounds.  Pet. App. 16a-33a.  \nFirst, the court found that small refineries have a pro-\ntectable property interest in being exempt from RFS \nprogram obligations, and that EPA had impermissibly \napplied its new analysis retroactively to deprive the re-\nfineries here of that interest.  Id. at 16a.  Second, the \ncourt rejected the agency\u2019s interpretation of the gov-\nerning statutory language.  The court characterized the \nagency\u2019s position as requiring that \u201ccompliance costs \nmust be the sole cause of\u200a\u201d hardship, id. at 23a, and it \ndisagreed on the ground that hardship may have \u201cmyr-\niad causes,\u201d id. at 25a.  Third, the court concluded that \nthe agency had acted arbitrarily and capriciously.  Id. \nat 29a-33a.  Without questioning the agency\u2019s RIN cost \npassthrough analysis as a general matter, id. at 31a \nn.44, the court found that the analysis was undermined \nas to the petitioning refineries by data concerning the \nparticular local markets in which they operate, id. at \n31a-33a. \nb. Judge Higginbotham dissented as to venue.  Pet. \nApp. 35a-43a.  He would have held that the denial ac-\ntions are \u201cnationally applicable\u201d because they \u201capply \none consistent statutory interpretation and economic \nanalysis to thirty-six small refineries, located in eight-\neen different states, in the geographical boundaries of \neight different circuit courts.\u201d  Id. at 38a.  In the alterna-\ntive, he concluded that the denial actions are \u201c\u200a\u2018based on \na determination of nationwide scope or effect\u2019\u200a\u201d because \nthe \u201ctwo determinations at the[ir] core\u201d\u2014the agency\u2019s \nstatutory interpretation and economic analysis\u2014\u201care ap-\n\n13 \n \nplicable to all small refineries no matter the location or \nmarket in which they operate.\u201d  Id. at 40a-42a. \n4. Other small refineries petitioned for review of the \nApril and June 2022 denial actions in the Third, Sev-\nenth, Ninth, Tenth, Eleventh, and D.C. Circuits.  Each \nof the other regional circuits either dismissed the peti-\ntions without prejudice based on improper venue2 or \ntransferred them to the D.C. Circuit.3   \nThe D.C. Circuit consolidated the various petitions \nthat were before it, and on July 26, 2024, the court va-\ncated and remanded the denial actions.  Sinclair Wyo-\nming Ref. Co. v. EPA, 114 F.4th 693 (per curiam).  The \ncourt held that EPA had imposed an \u201coverly strict cau-\nsation requirement\u201d in concluding that only dispropor-\ntionate compliance costs could justify granting an ex-\nemption and in failing to consider certain RIN pur-\nchases as a source of disproportionate economic hard-\nship.

Unlike the Fifth Circuit, however, the \nD.C. Circuit declined to address whether EPA\u2019s ap-\nproach was impermissibly retroactive.  Id. at 714 n.12.   \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nUnder the plain terms of Section 7607(b)(1), the de-\nnial actions here are reviewable only in the D.C. Circuit.  \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s contrary decision imposes atextual \nrequirements and fails to give effect to the provision \nCongress enacted.   \nA.  Under Section 7607(b)(1), \u201cnationally applicable\u201d \nEPA final actions are subject to judicial review only in \nthe D.C. Circuit.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  To apply that \nstatutory requirement, courts consider the final action \non its face and determine whether it applies to entities \nlocated throughout the country rather than in a single \nregion.  The denial actions here qualify as \u201cnationally \napplicable\u201d on that basis:  They resolve exemption peti-\ntions from small refineries located in 18 States and eight \nfederal judicial circuits across the country.   \nStatutory context confirms that result.  Section \n7607(b)(1) distinguishes between \u201cnationally applica-\nble\u201d EPA actions, which are subject to review in the \nD.C. Circuit, and \u201clocally or regionally applicable\u201d ac-\ntions, which are subject to review in \u201cthe appropriate \ncircuit.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1) (emphasis added).  Con-\ngress\u2019s use of the definite article indicates that there is \nonly one \u201cappropriate circuit\u201d for review of any partic-\nular \u201clocally or regionally applicable\u201d action.  When an \nEPA action applies to entities in multiple circuits, no \nsingle regional circuit can be identified as \u201cthe\u201d appro-\n\n15 \n \npriate venue, so the action is properly viewed as \u201cna-\ntionally applicable\u201d rather than \u201clocally or regionally \napplicable.\u201d   \nSection 7607(b)(1)\u2019s legislative history reinforces \nthat conclusion.  That history reflects Congress\u2019s un-\nderstanding that any \u201clocally or regionally applicable\u201d \naction could be reviewed in the regional court of appeals \nwhere the affected entity was located.  Where affected \nentities are spread across multiple circuits, however, \nCongress viewed the D.C. Circuit as the proper venue.   \nIn endorsing the contrary conclusion, both the court \nof appeals and respondents go beyond the statutory text \nto impose additional restrictions on the availability of \nD.C. Circuit review.  The court of appeals required that \nthe final action have a prospective effect on future \nagency decisions.  But the court did not ground that re-\nquirement in the statutory text, and respondents do not \ndefend it.  Respondents instead argue that, for venue \npurposes, the Court should treat the denial of each re-\nfinery\u2019s exemption petition as a separate \u201cfinal action.\u201d  \nBut that requirement likewise is untethered to the stat-\nutory text, and this Court has long recognized that \nagencies have discretion to devise their own procedures, \nincluding by aggregating common issues for joint reso-\nlution.  EPA acted reasonably in taking that approach \nhere.  And in determining the proper venue for chal-\nlenges to the agency\u2019s denial actions, the Court should \nfocus on the actions that EPA actually took, rather than \non a hypothetical array of 105 separate, refinery-specific \ndisapprovals. \nB.  Even if this Court finds the denial actions here to \nbe \u201clocally or regionally applicable,\u201d those actions are \nstill subject to review only in the D.C. Circuit because \nthey are \u201cbased on a determination of nationwide scope \n\n16 \n \nor effect,\u201d and EPA published its findings to that effect \nin accordance with Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s requirements.  \n42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).   \nIn requiring a \u201cdetermination of nationwide scope or \neffect,\u201d the statutory text focuses on the underlying \nreasons for EPA\u2019s final action.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  \nThe final action must be \u201cbased on\u201d the relevant deter-\nminations, indicating that the determinations must be a \nbut-for cause of the agency\u2019s final action\u2014forming the \ncore of the agency\u2019s analysis.  And to be nationwide in \nscope or effect, the core justifications for EPA\u2019s final \naction must be intended to govern the agency\u2019s deci-\nsionmaking in actions throughout the country, or have \nlegal consequences for entities beyond a single judicial \ncircuit.   \nThe denial actions here meet those requirements.  \nEPA found that the denial actions were based on two in-\nterrelated determinations of nationwide scope:  (1) EPA\u2019s \nstatutory interpretation that a small refinery\u2019s dispro-\nportionate economic hardship will support an exemp-\ntion only if it is caused by compliance with the RFS pro-\ngram; and (2) EPA\u2019s economic analysis of the national \nmarket for RINs, which found that the cost to acquire \nRINs is the same for refineries everywhere and is \npassed through to consumers in the price of fuels.  Those \ndeterminations apply to all small refinery exemption re-\nquests under the RFS program as a whole, and they \nwere the core rationales for EPA\u2019s denials of the ex-\nemption requests.   \nStatutory history confirms Congress\u2019s intent that \nEPA actions like the denial actions here would be re-\nviewable in the D.C. Circuit.  The original 1970 version \nof the venue provision did not specifically authorize \nD.C. Circuit review of final actions that are based on a \n\n17 \n \ndetermination of nationwide scope or effect.  That stat-\nutory gap led to litigation over which circuit qualified as \n\u201cthe appropriate circuit\u201d when EPA issued an action \nthat established a legal framework for implementation \nplans that spanned multiple States in multiple judicial \ncircuits.  In amending the statute to its current form, \nCongress adopted the view expressed by EPA\u2019s then-\nGeneral Counsel, who urged that challenges to such ac-\ntions should be channeled to the D.C. Circuit to \u201ccen-\ntralize review\u201d and \u201ctak[e] advantage of [the D.C. Cir-\ncuit\u2019s] administrative law expertise,\u201d thereby \u201cfacilitat-\ning an orderly development of the basic law\u201d that EPA \nwould apply nationwide.  41 Fed. Reg. 56,767, 56,769 \n(Dec. 30, 1976).   \nThe court of appeals and respondents have not dis-\nputed that the EPA actions at issue here rested in part \non interpretive and economic determinations having na-\ntionwide scope or effect.  They have observed, however, \nthat EPA also considered refinery-specific facts in rul-\ning on the exemption requests.  But the statute does not \nrequire that the final action be based solely on determi-\nnations of nationwide scope or effect.  Nor would such a \nlimitation make sense.  The third prong of Section \n7607(b)(1) comes into play only when the challenged \nEPA action is \u201clocally or regionally applicable,\u201d and \nsuch actions almost always will rest at least in part on \nconsideration of local or regional circumstances.  42 \nU.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  \nRespondents are also incorrect in asserting that \nEPA\u2019s interpretation would allow for D.C. Circuit venue \nfor challenges to every locally or regionally applicable \naction.  The statute imposes meaningful limits on EPA\u2019s \nauthority to find that a particular action is \u201cbased on a \ndetermination of nationwide scope or effect.\u201d  Courts \n\n18 \n \nshould enforce those limits without adding more of their \nown making.   \nARGUMENT \nTHE D.C. CIRCUIT IS THE APPROPRIATE VENUE FOR \nREVIEW OF THE DENIAL ACTIONS AT ISSUE HERE \nThe CAA\u2019s venue provision reflects a clear congres-\nsional preference for \u201cuniform judicial review of regula-\ntory issues of national importance.\u201d  National Environ-\nmental Development Ass\u2019n Clean Air Project v. EPA, \n891 F.3d 1041, 1054 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (Silberman, J., con-\ncurring).  Section 7607(b)(1) specifies two distinct cir-\ncumstances in which review of nationally significant \nEPA actions will be channeled to the D.C. Circuit.  First, \nany \u201cnationally applicable\u201d final action is subject to re-\nview exclusively in the D.C. Circuit.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  \nSecond, even if a challenged final action is \u201clocally or \nregionally applicable,\u201d venue lies exclusively in the D.C. \nCircuit if that action is \u201cbased on a determination of na-\ntionwide scope or effect and if in taking such action the \nAdministrator finds and publishes that such action is \nbased on such a determination.\u201d  Ibid.   \nBecause the denial actions at issue here resolve the \nexemption petitions of small refineries across the coun-\ntry, those actions are \u201cnationally applicable\u201d within the \nmeaning of Section 7607(b)(1).  In the alternative, if the \nCourt views the denial actions as \u201clocally or regionally \napplicable,\u201d those EPA actions are based on determina-\ntions of nationwide scope because they are grounded in \nEPA\u2019s statutory interpretation and analysis of market-\nplace conditions, both of which apply to all small refin-\nery exemption requests under the RFS program as a \nwhole.  Section 7607(b)(1) thus requires that challenges \nto the denial actions be brought in the D.C. Circuit. \n\n19 \n \nIndeed, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision in this case pro-\nvides a paradigmatic example of the outcome that Sec-\ntion 7607(b)(1) was intended to prevent.  The two EPA \ndenial actions at issue here collectively covered 105 ex-\nemption petitions from 39 small refineries located in \neight different judicial circuits.  The actions were prem-\nised on a statutory interpretation and an economic anal-\nysis that the agency had not previously announced, and \nthat constituted \u201cdetermination[s] of nationwide scope \nor effect\u201d under any reasonable understanding of that \nphrase.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  The ensuing briefing in \nthe court of appeals focused primarily on those nation-\nwide determinations, not on refinery-specific circum-\nstances.  The denial actions thus are precisely the types \nof EPA actions that Congress regarded as appropriate \nfor centralized D.C. Circuit review. \nUnder the Fifth Circuit\u2019s venue analysis, however, \nthe 25 covered refineries that challenged EPA\u2019s denial \nactions in court could have obtained judicial review only \nthrough individual challenges filed in seven different re-\ngional circuits.  That extreme fragmentation was avoided \nhere only because some refineries initially petitioned \nfor review in the D.C. Circuit, and five other regional \ncircuits either dismissed petitions for lack of venue or \ntransferred petitions to that court.  But if this Court en-\ndorses the Fifth Circuit\u2019s venue analysis, future chal-\nlenges to similar EPA actions can be expected to con-\nsume far greater judicial resources, with consequent \nheightened risks of inconsistent outcomes.  Congress \ncrafted Section 7607(b)(1) to avoid that result, and this \nCourt should vacate the court of appeals\u2019 judgment. \nA. The Denial Actions Are Nationally Applicable \nEach of the two denial actions resolved the exemp-\ntion petitions of more than 30 small refineries located in \n\n20 \n \nmultiple judicial circuits across the country.  It there-\nfore is apparent on the face of the final actions that they \nare \u201cnationally applicable\u201d and subject to review in the \nD.C. Circuit.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  The contrary argu-\nments advanced by the court of appeals and respond-\nents do not contest the reach of the two denial actions \nEPA issued, but instead advocate additional limitations \nthat the statutory text does not impose.   \n1.  The text, context, and history of Section 7607(b)(1) \nmake clear that the denial actions are nationally ap-\nplicable  \nSection 7607(b)(1) instructs that a challenge to a \u201cfi-\nnal action\u201d that is \u201cnationally applicable\u201d must be heard \nin the D.C. Circuit.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  That language \nencompasses the denial actions at issue here because \nthose actions apply to small refineries in multiple judi-\ncial circuits throughout the country.  The statutory con-\ntext and history confirm Congress\u2019s intent that the D.C. \nCircuit would review challenges to such actions.   \na. Under the text of Section 7607(b)(1), the proper \nvenue for challenges to EPA\u2019s implementation of the \nCAA depends on the \u201cfinal action\u201d that is being chal-\nlenged.  The term \u201caction\u201d in Section 7607(b)(1) \u201cis \nmeant to cover comprehensively every manner in which \nan agency may exercise its power.\u201d  Whitman v. Amer-\nican Trucking Ass\u2019ns, 531 U.S. 457, 478 (2001).  And as \nnumerous courts of appeals have recognized, the statu-\ntory text makes clear that venue turns on the nature of \nthe pertinent EPA action rather than on the basis for a \nparticular petitioner\u2019s challenge.  See, e.g., Hunt Ref. \nCo. v. EPA, 90 F.4th 1107, 1110 (11th Cir. 2024); South-\nern Ill. Power Coop. v. EPA, 863 F.3d 666, 671 (7th Cir. \n2017); American Road & Transp. Builders Ass\u2019n v. \nEPA, 705 F.3d 453, 455 (D.C. Cir. 2013), cert. denied, \n\n21 \n \n571 U.S. 1125 (2014); ATK Launch Sys., Inc. v. EPA, \n651 F.3d 1194, 1197 (10th Cir. 2011).  Courts thus must \nlook to the face of the action and determine whether it \napplies to\u2014or includes \u201cwithin its scope,\u201d Black\u2019s Law \nDictionary 91 (5th ed. 1979) (Black\u2019s) (defining \u201cap-\nply\u201d)\u2014entities \u201cthroughout [the] nation,\u201d Webster\u2019s \nThird New International Dictionary of the English \nLanguage 1505 (1976) (Webster\u2019s) (defining \u201cnation-\nally\u201d).     \nStatutory context sheds further light on what geo-\ngraphic scope an action must have to be \u201cnationally ap-\nplicable.\u201d  Under Section 7607(b)(1), each EPA action is \neither \u201cnationally applicable\u201d or \u201clocally or regionally \napplicable.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  In distinguishing be-\ntween those two types of actions, \u201c[t]he text of the stat-\nute leaves no room for an intermediate case.\u201d  Southern \nIll. Power Coop., 863 F.3d at 673.  If the challenged ac-\ntion is \u201cnationally applicable,\u201d the D.C. Circuit is the ex-\nclusive forum for judicial review.  And unless a \u201clocally \nor regionally applicable\u201d action is \u201cbased on a determi-\nnation of nationwide scope or effect,\u201d it may be chal-\nlenged \u201conly in the United States Court of Appeals for \nthe appropriate circuit.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  The stat-\nute\u2019s use of the definite article\u2014\u201cthe appropriate cir-\ncuit,\u201d ibid. (emphasis added)\u2014indicates that, for any \ngiven locally or regionally applicable EPA action, there \nis only one appropriate regional court of appeals in \nwhich to seek review.  Cf. Rumsfeld v. Padilla, 542 U.S. \n426, 434 (2004) (explaining that the \u201cuse of the definite \narticle\u201d in the federal habeas statute \u201cindicates that \n\n22 \n \nthere is generally only one proper respondent to a given \nprisoner\u2019s habeas petition\u201d).4 \nThe existence of a single appropriate court of ap-\npeals for this category of EPA actions in turn conveys \nthat a particular action is \u201clocally or regionally applica-\nble\u201d only if it applies to entities that are confined to a \nsingle judicial circuit.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  After all, \nfor an action that applies equally to entities in more \nthan one judicial circuit, no particular court of appeals \ncan be identified as \u201cthe appropriate circuit\u201d for review.  \nIbid. (emphasis added).  Thus, any action that spans \nmore than one judicial circuit is properly viewed as \u201cna-\ntionally applicable\u201d and subject to review only in the \nD.C. Circuit.  Ibid.   \nb. The history of Section 7607(b)(1) reflects the \nsame understanding.  As originally enacted in 1970, the \nCAA venue provision stated that any action \u201cpromul-\ngating any national primary or secondary ambient air \nquality standard,\u201d \u201cemission standard,\u201d \u201cstandard of \nperformance,\u201d or other specified standards or controls, \nwould be reviewable only in the D.C. Circuit.  42 U.S.C. \n1857h-5(b)(1) (1970).  The provision further specified \nthat any action \u201capproving or promulgating any imple-\nmentation plan\u201d could be reviewed only in \u201cthe appro-\npriate circuit.\u201d  Ibid.  Because that venue provision did \nnot specify the proper court for review of the many EPA \nactions that did not fall within any of the enumerated \ncategories, such actions were reviewable only by dis-\n \n4  Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s reference to \u201cthe appropriate circuit,\u201d 42 \nU.S.C. 7607(b)(1) (emphasis added), contrasts with the preceding \nsubsection, where Congress contemplated the prospect of multiple \npermissible forums by authorizing \u201cthe district court  * * *  for any \ndistrict in which such person is found or resides or transacts busi-\nness\u201d to issue certain orders, 42 U.S.C. 7607(a) (emphasis added). \n\n23 \n \ntrict courts exercising federal-question jurisdiction.  \nSee p. 3, supra.   \nThe actions that Congress specified for D.C. Circuit \nreview in the 1970 statute were all \u201cnational in scope,\u201d \nand Congress sought to ensure that they received \u201ceven \nand consistent national application\u201d through centralized \nreview.  1970 Senate Report 41.  By contrast, Congress \nviewed EPA actions approving or promulgating \u201cimple-\nmentation plans which run only to one air quality con-\ntrol region\u201d as amenable to review \u201cin the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Circuit in which the affected air quality \ncontrol region, or portion thereof, is located,\u201d ibid., \nwhich the statute referred to as \u201cthe appropriate cir-\ncuit,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 1857h-5(b)(1) (1970).   \nWhen Congress amended the statute in 1977 to ex-\npand the scope of direct court of appeals review, it \nadopted the same understanding of the limited geo-\ngraphic scope of actions that would be subject to review \nin \u201cthe appropriate circuit.\u201d  The 1977 House Report ex-\nplained that the revision would \u201cprovide[] for essen-\ntially locally, statewide, or regionally applicable rules or \norders to be reviewed in the U.S. court of appeals for \nthe circuit in which such locality, State, or region is lo-\ncated.\u201d  1977 House Report 323.  And the House Report \ncontrasted such local actions with nationally relevant \nactions that extend \u201cbeyond a single judicial circuit\u201d \nand therefore should be subject to centralized D.C. Cir-\ncuit review.  Id. at 324.  That history reinforces the con-\nclusion that, under the venue provision in its current \nform, final EPA actions that apply to entities in multiple \njudicial circuits are reviewable only in the D.C. Circuit.   \nc. Applying that understanding here, the denial ac-\ntions are nationally applicable.  EPA \u201cexercise[d] its \npower\u201d through two final denial actions, each of which \n\n24 \n \napplies to multiple entities located throughout the coun-\ntry in multiple federal judicial circuits.  Whitman, 531 \nU.S. at 478.  The April 2022 denial action covers \u201c36  \n* * *  petitions for exemptions from the RFS program \nfor over 30 small refineries across the country and ap-\nplies to small refineries located within 18 states in 7 of \nthe 10 EPA regions and in 8 different federal judicial \ncircuits.\u201d  Pet. App. 329a.  The June 2022 denial action \ncovers \u201c69 petitions for exemptions from the RFS pro-\ngram for over 30 small refineries across the country and \napplies to small refineries located within 15 states in 7 \nof the 10 EPA regions and in 8 different Federal judicial \ncircuits.\u201d  Id. at 187a.  On a plain-text understanding, \neach of the two denial actions is therefore \u201cnationally \napplicable,\u201d and respondents\u2019 challenges to those ac-\ntions can proceed only in the D.C. Circuit.  42 U.S.C. \n7607(b)(1); see Hunt Ref. Co., 90 F.4th at 1110.   \n2.  The court of appeals\u2019 and respondents\u2019 contrary rea-\nsoning is inconsistent with the statutory text  \nNeither the court of appeals nor respondents have \ndisputed that the denial actions at issue here apply to \nsmall refineries in multiple judicial circuits across the \ncountry.  Nor have they disputed the general proposi-\ntion that, when an EPA final action applies to entities in \nmultiple judicial circuits, that action is \u201cnationally ap-\nplicable\u201d within the meaning of Section 7607(b)(1).  The \ncourt of appeals nevertheless held that the denial ac-\ntions are not \u201cnationally applicable\u201d because those ac-\ntions apply only to the specific refineries whose exemp-\ntion petitions EPA adjudicated, and those adjudications \nwill not bind the agency in any future proceeding.  Re-\nspondents have not endorsed that rationale, but have \nargued instead that the denial actions should be viewed \nfor venue purposes as 105 separate denials of 105 ex-\n\n25 \n \nemption petitions, each of which is confined to a single \njudicial circuit.  Those arguments lack merit. \na. The court of appeals found it significant that the \ndenial actions apply only to the petitioning refineries \nand do not \u201cbind[] EPA in any future adjudication.\u201d  \nPet. App. 12a.  But the court did not attempt to tether \nthat observation to the statutory text.  And nothing in \nSection 7607(b)(1) suggests that a final action must bind \nEPA prospectively in order to be considered \u201cnationally \napplicable.\u201d  The court of appeals erred by effectively \n\u201cadd[ing] words  * * *  to the statute Congress enacted\u201d \nand \u201cimpos[ing] a new requirement\u201d that atextually lim-\nits the category of actions encompassed within Section \n7607(b)(1)\u2019s first category.  Muldrow v. City of St. \nLouis, 601 U.S. 346, 355 (2024).   \nIndeed, under the court of appeals\u2019 approach, virtu-\nally no adjudicatory actions would be deemed \u201cnation-\nally applicable\u201d because agency adjudications typically \n\u201clack \u2018legal effect\u2019 beyond the parties involved.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 39a (Higginbotham, J., dissenting).  But the venue \nprovision at issue here refers broadly to \u201cany other na-\ntionally applicable regulations promulgated, or final ac-\ntion taken.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1) (emphasis added).  \nSuch \u201cexpansive language\u201d is not amenable to the kind \nof \u201climiting construction\u201d the court of appeals\u2019 analysis \nwould impose.  Harrison v. PPG Industries, Inc., 446 \nU.S. 578, 589 (1980); see Whitman, 531 U.S. at 478.  \nElsewhere in Section 7607(b)(1), Congress distinguished \namong particular agency actions by referring specifi-\ncally to a \u201cregulation[]\u201d or \u201corder.\u201d  42 U.S.C 7607(b)(1).  \nIn contrast, Congress\u2019s reference to \u201cany other nation-\nally applicable  * * *  final action\u201d should be given its \nnatural meaning rather than subjected to artificial con-\nstraints.  Ibid.; cf. Nielsen v. Preap, 586 U.S. 392, 414 \n\n26 \n \n(2019) (presuming that \u201cevery word and every provi-\nsion\u201d in a statute \u201cis to be given effect\u201d) (citation omit-\nted).   \nb. Respondents do not defend the court of appeals\u2019 \nreliance on the adjudicative character of the denial ac-\ntions.  Instead, respondents contend (Br. in Opp. 17-21) \nthat, for purposes of the venue provision, the relevant \n\u201cfinal action[s]\u201d are not the two denial actions issued in \nApril and June of 2022, but rather 105 separate denials \nof the various petitioning refineries\u2019 exemption re-\nquests.  That is incorrect.   \nRespondents argue that here, \u201c[t]he final EPA action \n\u2018under\u2019 the CAA is EPA\u2019s adjudication of individual \nhardship petitions.\u201d  Br. in Opp. 18.  Respondents high-\nlight the fact that Section 7545(o)(9)(B) allows \u201ca small \nrefinery\u201d to petition for an exemption and requires EPA \nto \u201cevaluat[e] a petition.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(B) (em-\nphases added).  But neither that CAA provision nor any \nother restricts EPA\u2019s ability to consider petitions to-\ngether and resolve common issues in a single action.  \nThe court of appeals recognized that \u201c[w]ithout more,\u201d \nthe use of \u201can indefinite article immediately followed \nwith a singular noun\u201d does not \u201cshow that the relevant \nstatutory provisions require EPA to consider exemp-\ntion petitions individually.\u201d  Pet. App. 29a.   \nThe Dictionary Act, ch. 71, 16 Stat. 431, instructs \nthat, \u201cunless the context indicates otherwise[,] words \nimporting the singular include and apply to several per-\nsons, parties, or things.\u201d  1 U.S.C. 1.  Here, the context \nprovides no reason to doubt that EPA may evaluate \nmultiple petitions in a single action.  Indeed, this Court \nhas long recognized that administrative agencies \n\u201cshould be free to fashion their own rules of procedure \nand to pursue methods of inquiry capable of permitting \n\n27 \n \nthem to discharge their multitudinous duties.\u201d  FCC v. \nPottsville Broadcasting Co., 309 U.S. 134, 143 (1940); \nsee Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural \nResources Defense Council, 435 U.S. 519, 524 (1978) \n(\u201c[T]his Court has for more than four decades empha-\nsized that the formulation of procedures was basically \nto be left within the discretion of the agencies to which \nCongress had confided the responsibility for substan-\ntive judgments.\u201d).  That discretion includes the ability \nto determine \u201cwhether applications should be heard \ncontemporaneously or successively.\u201d  Pottsville, 309 \nU.S. at 138.  Section 7545(o)(9)(B)\u2019s use of an indefinite \narticle is an insufficient basis for inferring any con-\nstraint on EPA\u2019s discretion to aggregate similar peti-\ntions for joint resolution.    \nThere is nothing unusual or problematic about EPA\u2019s \ndecision to group the various exemption petitions to de-\ncide the common issues that affect refineries across the \ncountry.  That approach aligns with Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s \naim to promote national uniformity and with EPA\u2019s \nlongstanding practice of resolving similar issues in a \nsingle action to ensure consistent treatment.  See ATK \nLaunch Sys., 651 F.3d at 1197 (single EPA action prom-\nulgating air quality designations for 31 areas across 18 \nStates); RMS of Ga., LLC v. EPA, 64 F.4th 1368, 1371 \n(11th Cir. 2023) (single EPA action adjudicating allow-\nance requests and issuing allowances to 32 entities to \nconsume hydrofluorocarbons); West Virginia Chamber \nof Commerce v. Browner, 166 F.3d 336 (4th Cir. 1998) \n(Tbl.) (per curiam) (single EPA action declaring that 22 \nStates\u2019 implementation plans were inadequate and re-\nquired revisions).  Indeed, such aggregation generally \nis encouraged as a means of efficiently adjudicating \ncommon issues.  See Committee on Adjudication, Ad-\n\n28 \n \nministrative Conference of the United States, Aggrega-\ntion of Similar Claims in Agency Adjudication (June \n13, 2016), https://perma.cc/2UQS-TJ6F. \nEPA\u2019s approach was particularly sensible here.  \nEPA was considering the exemption petitions in light of \nthis Court\u2019s decision in HollyFrontier, and in light of \nthe Tenth Circuit\u2019s reasoning in Renewable Fuels Asso-\nciation on issues this Court had not addressed.  See pp. \n6-7, supra.  EPA grouped the petitions together for res-\nolution in order to \u201capply one consistent statutory in-\nterpretation and economic analysis to thirty-six small \nrefineries, located in eighteen different states, in the ge-\nographical boundaries of eight different circuit courts.\u201d  \nPet. App. 38a (Higginbotham, J., dissenting); see also \npp. 7-8, supra.   \nIn making prior exemption decisions, EPA has some-\ntimes declined to group multiple petitions for resolution \nin a single action because the agency concluded that the \ncircumstances did not call for such treatment.  When \nEPA has issued decisions on petitions from individual \nsmall refineries, EPA has recognized that the actions \nare locally or regionally applicable.  See, e.g., Producers \nof Renewables United for Integrity Truth & Transpar-\nency v. EPA, No. 18-1202, Doc. 1775897 (D.C. Cir. Mar. \n4, 2019).  But whichever course EPA chooses in a par-\nticular instance, it is the face of the final action that de-\ntermines the proper venue.  \nRespondents\u2019 position would require the court where \na petition for review is filed to look behind EPA\u2019s char-\nacterization of its own agency action and potentially \nsubstitute a judicial determination of the relevant unit \nof analysis.  But respondents provide little guidance on \nhow courts would make that determination.  Lower \ncourts confronted with such arguments have generally \n\n29 \n \nrejected requests to second-guess EPA\u2019s own framing \nand have focused solely on the face of the final agency \naction.  See, e.g., Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. EPA, 45 F.4th \n380, 387 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (rejecting petitioner\u2019s argu-\nment that EPA\u2019s construction and application to a spe-\ncific context of \u201cnationally applicable provisions of the \nClean Air Act\u201d rendered the agency action itself nation-\nally applicable); Sierra Club v. EPA, 47 F.4th 738, 744 \n(D.C. Cir. 2022) (rejecting petitioner\u2019s argument that \nEPA\u2019s approvals of Texas\u2019s state implementation plans \nwere nationally applicable because EPA had announced \na new understanding that would apply in other loca-\ntions, thereby \u201ceffectively amend[ing] the agency\u2019s na-\ntional implementation regulations\u201d); Southern Ill. Power \nCoop., 863 F.3d at 671 (rejecting petitioner\u2019s argument \nthat EPA\u2019s designations of nonattainment areas were \nan \u201camalgamation of many different locally or region-\nally applicable actions\u201d); RMS of Ga., 64 F.4th at 1374 \n(rejecting petitioner\u2019s argument that an allocation of al-\nlowances among entities should be considered a \u201cdocu-\nment detailing many smaller individual actions\u201d).   \nFocusing on the face of the EPA action has allowed \ncourts and litigants to quickly and efficiently determine \nwhere venue lies, preventing wasteful expenditure of \nresources resolving threshold issues, and furthering \nSection 7607(b)(1)\u2019s purpose of \u201cprioritiz[ing] efficiency.\u201d  \nNational Ass\u2019n of Mfrs. v. Department of Defense, 583 \nU.S. 109, 130 (2018).  Respondents\u2019 approach, by con-\ntrast, would \u201cintroduce[] needless uncertainty into the \ndetermination of venue, where the need for clear rules \nis especially acute.\u201d  Southern Ill. Power Coop., 863 F.3d \nat 673.   \n\n30 \n \nB. The Denial Actions At Issue Here Are Based On Deter-\nminations Of Nationwide Scope Or Effect \nEven if the Court concludes that EPA\u2019s denial ac-\ntions here are \u201clocally or regionally applicable,\u201d those \nactions still are reviewable exclusively in the D.C. Cir-\ncuit.  Those actions are \u201cbased on a determination of na-\ntionwide scope or effect,\u201d and EPA published findings \nto that effect.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).   \n1.  The denial actions at issue here were based on deter-\nminations of nationwide scope \nUnder Section 7607(b)(1), a final action that is \u201clo-\ncally or regionally applicable\u201d is nonetheless reviewable \nin the D.C. Circuit if it is \u201cbased on a determination of \nnationwide scope or effect, and if in taking such action \nthe Administrator finds and publishes that such action \nis based on such a determination.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  \nThere is no dispute that EPA published the requisite \nfindings.  See Pet. App. 12a-13a; see also April Notice, \n87 Fed. Reg. at 24,301; June Notice, 87 Fed. Reg. at \n34,874.  Those findings were correct.   \na. A \u201cdetermination\u201d is a \u201cdecision arrived at or \npromulgated; a determinate sentence, conclusion, or \nopinion.\u201d  4 The Oxford English Dictionary 548 (2d ed. \n1989) (OED); see Webster\u2019s 616 (\u201cthe settling and end-\ning of a controversy esp. by judicial decision\u201d; \u201cthe re-\nsolving of a question by argument or reasoning\u201d).  The \ntext of Section 7607(b)(1) distinguishes between the \nagency\u2019s \u201cfinal action\u201d and the relevant underlying \u201cde-\ntermination.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  A particular EPA \naction may reflect multiple agency determinations, but \nby referring to \u201ca determination of nationwide scope or \neffect,\u201d Section 7607(b)(1) authorizes D.C. Circuit venue \n(if EPA publishes the requisite finding) so long as any \n\n31 \n \nsingle determination of that kind forms the basis of the \naction.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1) (emphasis added).   \nRequiring that the action be \u201c\u200a\u2018based on\u2019\u200a\u201d the rele-\nvant determination ordinarily \u201cindicates a but-for causal \nrelationship and thus a necessary logical condition.\u201d  \nSafeco Ins. Co. of Am. v. Burr, 551 U.S. 47, 63 (2007).  \nEPA\u2019s actions may be\u2014and frequently are\u2014based on \nmultiple determinations, and courts have long accepted \nsuch independent causes as adequate.  See Bostock v. \nClayton County, 590 U.S. 644, 656 (2020) (noting that \n\u201c[o]ften, events have multiple but-for causes\u201d that can \nbe sufficient to trigger liability).  Under \u201cthe traditional \nbut-for causation standard,\u201d causation cannot be de-\nfeated \u201cjust by citing some other factor that contributed \nto [the] challenged  * * *  decision.\u201d  Ibid.  \u201cSo long as\u201d \nthe relevant determination \u201cwas one but-for cause of \nth[e] decision, that is enough to trigger the law.\u201d  Ibid.  \nThus, under Section 7607(b)(1), the relevant determina-\ntions must \u201clie at the core of the agency action\u201d and can-\nnot be \u201c[m]erely peripheral or extraneous.\u201d  Texas v. \nEPA, 829 F.3d 405, 419 (5th Cir. 2016).   \nSection 7607(b)(1) further provides that venue may \nbe appropriate in the D.C. Circuit when the relevant de-\ntermination has \u201cnationwide scope or effect.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n7607(b)(1) (emphasis added).  \u201cScope\u201d means \u201cthe gen-\neral range or extent of cognizance, consideration, activ-\nity, or influence.\u201d  Webster\u2019s 2035; see 14 OED 672 \n(\u201c[R]ange of application or of subjects embraced.\u201d).  \n\u201cEffect\u201d generally means \u201csomething that is produced \nby an agent or cause.\u201d  Webster\u2019s 724; see 5 OED 79 (\u201cTo \nbring about\u201d; \u201cto accomplish\u201d).  When used with respect \nto a statute, \u201ceffect\u201d refers to \u201c[t]he result  * * *  which \na statute will produce upon the existing law.\u201d  Black\u2019s \n462.  Applying that definition in the context of agency \n\n32 \n \naction, the \u201ceffect\u201d of an agency determination refers to \nthe legal consequences that determination produces.  \nThus, Section 7607(b)(1) allows for D.C. Circuit review \nwhen EPA\u2019s final action sets out as a core justification \na principle or conclusion that is intended to govern the \nagency\u2019s decisionmaking in actions throughout the coun-\ntry, or when a central rationale for EPA\u2019s final action \nhas legal consequences for entities beyond a single ju-\ndicial circuit.   \nUnder the third prong of Section 7607(b)(1), a locally \nor regionally applicable action is reviewable in the D.C. \nCircuit only if (a) the action \u201cis based on a determina-\ntion of nationwide scope or effect\u201d and (b) EPA \u201cfinds \nand publishes that such action is based on such a deter-\nmination.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  When EPA publishes \nthe specified finding, a person who seeks review of the \npertinent EPA action may argue that the finding is in-\ncorrect and that venue therefore lies in a regional cir-\ncuit.  In such cases, any disputes about the meaning of \nthe phrase \u201cdetermination of nationwide scope or ef-\nfect\u201d will present questions of statutory interpretation \nthat courts must decide de novo.  See Loper Bright En-\nterprises v. Raimondo, 144 S. Ct. 2244, 2266 (2024).  But \nEPA\u2019s finding that the statutory standard is satisfied \nwith respect to a particular final action ordinarily will be \ngoverned by the arbitrary-and-capricious standard.  See \n5 U.S.C. 706(2)(A) (requiring application of arbitrary-\nand-capricious standard to \u201cagency action, findings, and \nconclusions\u201d); cf. 42 U.S.C. 7607(d)(9) (requiring appli-\ncation of arbitrary-and-capricious standard to particu-\nlar EPA actions).  That deferential standard of review \naccounts for the fact that EPA has obvious knowledge \nand expertise with respect to the centrality of the rele-\nvant \u201cdetermination\u201d to the agency\u2019s own decisionmaking \n\n33 \n \nprocess.  See Marsh v. Oregon Natural Resources Coun-\ncil, 490 U.S. 360, 376-377 (1989) (applying arbitrary-and-\ncapricious review to a \u201cfactual dispute\u201d as to whether \n\u201cnew information undermines conclusions\u201d the agency \nreached because such a question \u201cimplicates substantial \nagency expertise\u201d). \nBy contrast, nothing in the statute requires EPA to \n\u201cfind[] and publish[] that [an] action is based on  * * *  a \ndetermination\u201d of nationwide scope or effect, 42 U.S.C. \n7607(b)(1), even when the facts and law would support \nsuch a finding.  Rather, when EPA declines to publish \nsuch a finding, that decision \u201cis committed to the agency\u2019s \ndiscretion and thus is unreviewable,\u201d Sierra Club, 47 \nF.4th at 745, and it effectively precludes D.C. Circuit \nvenue under Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s third prong.  Thus, for \nany locally or regionally applicable action that is based \non a determination of nationwide scope or effect, Con-\ngress \u201centrusted EPA with discretion to determine the \nproper venue as the agency sees fit.\u201d  Id. at 746; accord \nTexas v. EPA, 983 F.3d 826, 834-835 (5th Cir. 2020).  If \nEPA concludes that a regional circuit is \u201cbest equipped \nto evaluate\u201d a particular agency action based on \u201clocal \nmarket conditions,\u201d Br. in Opp. 21, EPA may decline to \npublish the relevant finding, thereby ensuring that the \nregional circuit will have venue over any challenge to \nthe action. \nb. As EPA correctly found, the denial actions at is-\nsue here were \u201cbased on\u201d two interrelated \u201cdetermina-\ntion[s] of nationwide scope.\u201d  See April Notice, 87 Fed. \nReg. at 24,301; June Notice, 87 Fed. Reg. at 34,874.  \nFirst, the agency adopted a new interpretation of 42 \nU.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(B), construing that provision to re-\nquire that any qualifying hardship \u201cmust be caused by \ncompliance with the RFS program\u201d rather than by \n\n34 \n \nsome unrelated circumstance.  Pet. App. 242a (capitali-\nzation and emphasis altered).  Second, EPA deter-\nmined, as a matter of economic reality, that every refin-\nery recovers the cost of the RIN at the time it sells a \ngallon of fuel.  See id. at 249a.  And because the \u201crefin-\ning and fuel blending markets are highly competitive,\u201d \nEPA found that \u201cRINs are generally widely available in \nan open and liquid market,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he cost of ac-\nquiring RINs is the same for all parties\u201d\u2014features that \n\u201cfacilitate the RIN cost passthrough.\u201d  Ibid.  In light of \nthose two determinations, EPA concluded that, absent \nunusual circumstances, compliance with the RFS pro-\ngram cannot cause disproportionate economic hardship \nto small refineries.   \nAs an interpretation of the statute and an analysis of \nthe national fuels and RIN markets that govern all \nsmall refineries throughout the country seeking exemp-\ntions from the RFS program, EPA\u2019s determinations are \n\u201cnationwide\u201d in scope.  Pet. App. 327a-328a.  That EPA \nadopted and applied those determinations uniformly to \nsmall refineries across the country is evidence of that \nfact.  Those core determinations played a decisive role \nin EPA\u2019s denial actions, leading EPA to presume that \nthe petitioning small refineries across the country had \nnot experienced disproportionate economic hardship\u2014\na presumption that EPA concluded no individual refin-\neries had succeeded in rebutting.  See id. at 15a.  And \nthose determinations were essential to the validity of \nthe challenged denial actions, such that judicial rejec-\ntion of either determination would provide a sufficient \nbasis for reversing the actions.5 \n \n5  Under the RFS program, EPA establishes percentage stand-\nards each year that all obligated parties must use to satisfy their \n \n\n35 \n \nIndeed, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s ultimate merits disposi-\ntion of the petitions for review here confirms that the \nchallenged denial actions were \u201cbased on\u201d the statutory \ninterpretation and economic analysis described above.  \nIn this case the Fifth Circuit, having concluded that \nEPA\u2019s statutory interpretation was inconsistent with \nthe CAA\u2019s text (Pet. App. 23a-27a) and that \u201cEPA\u2019s \nRIN-passthrough theory [was] contrary to the evi-\ndence\u201d (id. at 30a; see id. at 29a-33a), granted the peti-\ntions for review and vacated the denial actions.  See id. \nat 34a.  If judicial invalidation of the relevant determi-\nnation would provide a sufficient basis for finding the \nfinal action itself to be \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse \nof discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,\u201d \n42 U.S.C. 7607(d)(9)(A); 5 U.S.C. 706(2), then the deter-\nmination is properly viewed as \u201ca necessary logical con-\ndition\u201d of the action, Safeco, 551 U.S. at 63, and the req-\nuisite causal relationship exists.  \nc. The statutory history confirms that Congress in-\ntended for final actions like those at issue here to be \nsubject to review in the D.C. Circuit.   \n \nportion of the nationwide target volumes, see p. 4, supra.  When \nEPA anticipates granting an exemption petition at the time it estab-\nlishes the percentage standard, it accounts for that exemption by \nshifting the pro rata burden to other obligated parties.  See Pet. \nApp. 248a & n.139.  If EPA later grants an exemption it did not an-\nticipate, the result is that the national target volumes will not be \nreached for that year.  See id. at 246a & n.135.  EPA\u2019s exemption \ndecisions thus implicate the legal obligations of all non-exempt re-\nfineries across the country.  That reality further underscores the \nneed for nationwide uniformity, and thus the appropriateness of \nD.C. Circuit review, which ensures that uniform standards will ap-\nply and that no refinery will receive a competitive advantage based \non the happenstance of the circuit in which it is located. \n\n36 \n \nBefore Congress amended the venue provision to au-\nthorize D.C. Circuit review of locally or regionally ap-\nplicable actions with nationwide scope or effect, the \n1970 statute made the approval or promulgation of state \nor federal plans reviewable in \u201cthe appropriate circuit.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. 1857h-5(b)(1) (1970).  Disputes concerning \nthat language spawned protracted litigation.  See David \nP. Currie, Judicial Review Under Federal Pollution \nLaws, 62 Iowa L. Rev. 1221, 1262-1269 (1977) (Currie).  \nParties faced a lack of clarity as to which circuit was \n\u201cthe appropriate circuit\u201d when a petitioner challenged a \nfinal action pertaining to state implementation plans \nsubmitted by multiple states spanning multiple judicial \ncircuits.  Id. at 1264.   \nIn light of that uncertainty, one petitioner filed iden-\ntical petitions in ten regional circuits, with an eleventh \nin the D.C. Circuit, and then asked each of the regional \ncircuits to transfer the case to the D.C. Circuit for res-\nolution.  Currie 1263.  Five courts of appeals agreed to \ndo so, while the other five stayed proceedings pending \nthe disposition of the D.C. Circuit case.  Ibid.  Each of \nthe petitions challenged an EPA action that had ap-\nproved numerous state implementation plans based on \nthe agency\u2019s determination that the attainment dead-\nlines for certain pollutants should be extended because \nnecessary control measures would not be available in \nthe time otherwise prescribed.  See Natural Resources \nDefense Council v. EPA, 475 F.2d 968, 969-970 (D.C. \nCir. 1973) (per curiam). \nIn an opinion approving a transfer and finding the \nD.C. Circuit to be \u201cthe appropriate circuit,\u201d the First \nCircuit explained that \u201c[t]he legal issues raised by peti-\ntioners in the\u201d various pending cases \u201cseem[ed] to be \nidentical,\u201d and that \u201clitigation in several circuits, with \n\n37 \n \npossible delayed results on the merits, can only serve to \nfrustrate the strong Congressional interest in improv-\ning the environment.\u201d  Natural Resources Defense \nCouncil v. EPA, 465 F.2d 492, 494 (1st Cir. 1972) (per \ncuriam).  The D.C. Circuit agreed, explaining that \n\u201c[n]one of the[] issues\u201d raised by the petitions \u201cinvolve \nfacts or laws peculiar to any one jurisdiction; rather, all \nconcern uniform determinations of nationwide effect \nmade by the Administrator.\u201d  Natural Resources De-\nfense Council, 475 F.2d at 970.   \nIn 1976, the Administrative Conference of the United \nStates (ACUS) drafted recommendations for amending \nand clarifying the CAA venue provision.  41 Fed. Reg. \nat 56,767.  ACUS urged Congress to \u201cclarify[] that the \nappropriate circuit is the one containing the state whose \nplan is challenged.\u201d  Ibid.  EPA General Counsel G. Wil-\nliam Frick provided additional views, however, and \ncounseled that \u201cwhere \u2018national issues\u2019 are involved \nthey should be reviewed in the D.C. Circuit.\u201d  Id. at \n56,768.  Frick noted that, although EPA actions involv-\ning state implementation plans \u201cusually involve issues \npeculiar to the affected States, such actions sometimes \ninvolve generic determinations of nationwide scope or \neffect.\u201d  Id. at 56,768-56,769.  In Frick\u2019s view, \u201cCongress \nintended review in the D.C. Circuit of \u2018matters on which \nnational uniformity is desirable\u2019\u200a\u201d because of \u201cthe D.C. \nCircuit\u2019s obvious expertise in administrative law mat-\nters\u201d and its familiarity with the CAA\u2019s \u201ccomplex\u201d text \nand history.  Id. at 56,769.  Citing the Natural Re-\nsources Defense Council cases as illustrative, Frick ex-\nplained that it \u201cmakes sense to centralize review of \u2018na-\ntional\u2019 [state implementation plan] issues in the D.C. \nCircuit, taking advantage of its administrative law ex-\npertise and facilitating an orderly development of the \n\n38 \n \nbasic law under the Act, rather than to have such issues \ndecided separately by a number of courts.\u201d  Ibid. \nBy authorizing D.C. Circuit review of final EPA ac-\ntions that are based on \u201cdetermination[s] of nationwide \nscope or effect,\u201d the 1977 amendments incorporated \nFrick\u2019s own language.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1); see 41 Fed. \nReg. at 56,768-56,769.  The House Report that accompa-\nnied the 1977 amendments \u201cconcur[red]\u201d with Frick\u2019s \n\u201ccomments, concerns, and recommendation.\u201d  1977 House \nReport 324.  That history reflects Congress\u2019s awareness \nthat, even when a particular EPA action specifically ad-\ndresses a single State, region, or entity, judicial review \nof the action may implicate national concerns.  After \nconsidering the competing viewpoints expressed by \nACUS and Frick as to the proper means of resolving \nthose national issues, Congress opted to authorize uni-\nform resolution by providing a mechanism for exclusive \nD.C. Circuit review.  \n2.  The court of appeals\u2019 and respondents\u2019 contrary rea-\nsoning would render the \u201cnationwide scope or effect\u201d \nprong of Section 7607(b)(1) practically insignificant \nThe court of appeals and respondents have largely \nignored the determinations of nationwide scope or ef-\nfect that EPA identified.  The court and respondents \nhave focused instead on the refinery-specific circum-\nstances that EPA also considered in the course of de-\ntermining whether individual refineries could rebut the \npresumption the agency had established.  That myopic \napproach is inconsistent with the statutory text and \nwould severely undercut the intended reach of the third \nprong of Section 7607(b)(1).  Under the correct inter-\npretation of the statute, that prong has both meaningful \nreach and meaningful limits, each designed to further \nCongress\u2019s purpose of channeling to the D.C. Circuit \n\n39 \n \nthose challenges that are likely to raise issues of na-\ntional importance.   \na. The Fifth Circuit erred in rejecting EPA\u2019s finding \nthat the denial actions are based on determinations of \nnationwide scope or effect.  The court stated that EPA\u2019s \nstatutory interpretation and economic analysis\u2014\u201cwithout \nmore\u201d\u2014\u201cfail to provide the agency with a sufficient ba-\nsis to adjudicate exemption petitions.\u201d  Pet. App. 15a.  \nThe court observed that, in ruling on a specific exemp-\ntion request, EPA must examine \u201crefinery-specific\u201d \nfacts to ensure that local circumstances do not warrant \na departure from the agency\u2019s general economic analy-\nsis.  Ibid.  Respondents likewise emphasize (Br. in Opp. \n23) that EPA considered \u201clocal facts and data\u201d in deter-\nmining that the refineries\u2019 exemption requests should \nbe denied. \nIn treating that aspect of EPA\u2019s methodology as de-\ncisive, the court and respondents would effectively limit \nD.C. Circuit venue under Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s third \nprong to review of EPA actions that are based solely on \ndeterminations of nationwide scope or effect.  Nothing \nin the statutory text supports that approach.  Where \nCongress intended to require such a limitation, it said \nso explicitly.  See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1) (providing \nan exception to the statute\u2019s 60-day filing window where \nthe \u201cpetition is based solely on grounds arising after\u201d \nthat time period expires) (emphasis added); cf. Bostock, \n590 U.S. at 656 (\u201cAs it has in other statutes, [Congress] \ncould have added \u2018solely\u2019 to indicate that actions taken \n\u2018because of\u200a\u2019 the confluence of multiple factors do not vi-\nolate the law.\u201d).  And this approach would effectively \npreclude application of Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s third prong \nto adjudications, which by their nature involve discrete \n\n40 \n \nparties and virtually always implicate at least some \nparty-specific facts and judgments.  Cf. p. 25, supra.   \nMore fundamentally, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s approach \nwould largely drain the \u201cnationwide scope or effect\u201d \nprong of any practical significance.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  \nBy its terms, Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s third prong applies \nonly to actions that are \u201clocally or regionally applica-\nble.\u201d  Ibid.  Nearly all such actions can be expected to \nrest at least in part on consideration of local or regional \ncircumstances.  Yet on the Fifth Circuit\u2019s view, EPA\u2019s \nconsideration of such circumstances as one aspect of its \nanalysis suffices to preclude application of Section \n7607(b)(1)\u2019s third prong.   \nAs explained above (see pp. 37-38, supra), Congress \nenacted Section 7607(b)(1) in its current form after \nEPA\u2019s then-General Counsel highlighted the fact that \nEPA\u2019s approval and promulgation of implementation \nplans for individual States, which will necessarily rest \nat least in part on State-specific circumstances, can also \nraise issues of national significance for which D.C. Cir-\ncuit review is appropriate.  See 41 Fed. Reg. at 56,769.  \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision thus contravenes Con-\ngress\u2019s purpose of centralizing review of national issues \nin the D.C. Circuit and prioritizing the efficient resolu-\ntion of those issues, even when the actions also address \nlocal or regional concerns.  See Pet. App. 43a (Hig-\nginbotham, J., dissenting).   \nb. Respondents also contend that, because \u201cEPA in \nevery action [must] apply a uniform approach to simi-\nlarly affected parties,\u201d adopting the government\u2019s in-\nterpretation would allow D.C. Circuit venue for chal-\nlenges to every locally or regionally applicable EPA ac-\ntion.  Br. in Opp. 25-26.  That is incorrect.  The statutory \n\n41 \n \ntext includes significant limitations that would prevent \nthat result.   \ni. As an initial matter, the relevant language in Sec-\ntion 7607(b)(1) imposes a causation requirement, au-\nthorizing D.C. Circuit venue only when the challenged \nagency action is \u201cbased on a determination of nation-\nwide scope or effect.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1) (emphasis \nadded).  See pp. 30-31, supra.  EPA\u2019s finding that such \na standard is satisfied is subject to arbitrary-and- \ncapricious review.  See p. 32, supra.  That causation re-\nquirement ensures that D.C. Circuit review will be \navailable only if the relevant determinations are at the \ncore of EPA\u2019s action.  For the reasons already ex-\nplained, ibid., that causation requirement is satisfied \nhere\u2014but it will not be satisfied for every EPA action. \nii. The word \u201cdetermination\u201d suggests a resolution \nof an unsettled issue.  See Webster\u2019s 616 (\u201cthe settling \nand ending of a controversy esp. by judicial decision\u201d).  \nOn that understanding, EPA does not make a \u201cdetermi-\nnation of nationwide scope\u201d when it merely applies a \npreviously established agency rule, policy, or interpre-\ntation to new \u201clocally or regionally applicable\u201d circum-\nstances, even if EPA has previously expressed its intent \nthat the relevant agency rule or policy will apply nation-\nwide.  In deciding whether an EPA rule or policy con-\nstitutes a \u201cdetermination\u201d when the agency applies it in \ntaking a new action, the court may consider whether \nEPA announced the rule or policy at roughly the same \ntime as the challenged agency action itself.  The court \nmay also consider whether the participants in any  \nnotice-and-comment period or comparable agency pro-\nceeding leading up to the challenged action contested \nthe validity of the rule or policy. \n\n42 \n \nThat approach reflects a textually reasonable under-\nstanding of the statutory term \u201cdetermination,\u201d and it \nwould further the congressional policy judgments re-\nflected in the second and third prongs of Section \n7607(b)(1).  The vast majority of \u201clocally or regionally \napplicable\u201d EPA actions reflect the application of some \nnationwide agency rule, policy, or interpretation to a \nfactual setting that is confined to a single judicial cir-\ncuit.  When the circumstances suggest that the rule, pol-\nicy, or interpretation itself is likely to be called into \nquestion in any judicial challenge to the EPA action, \nrouting such challenges to the D.C. Circuit serves im-\nportant interests in judicial efficiency and nationwide \nuniformity.  That is particularly so if the relevant EPA \ndetermination is intended to govern future agency ac-\ntions.  But where the validity of the general rule or pol-\nicy appears to be settled, such that any judicial chal-\nlenges to the action are likely to focus on the application \nof the general pronouncement to discrete local facts, \nthose interests are inapposite. \nHere, EPA\u2019s new statutory interpretation and eco-\nnomic analysis were announced at roughly the same \ntime as, and were intended to guide, the denial actions \nthemselves.  Comments on the proposed denial actions \ndisputed the validity of the interpretation and analysis.  \nSee C.A. App. 96-144, 242-290 (summarizing and re-\nsponding to comments).  The interpretation and analy-\nsis therefore are properly viewed as EPA \u201cdetermina-\ntion[s]\u201d within the meaning of Section 7607(b)(1), rather \nthan as the application of settled nationwide principles \nto new factual settings.6 \n \n6  Respondents have contended (Br. in Opp. 29) that EPA\u2019s April \nand June 2022 denial actions raise distinct venue issues because the \n \n\n43 \n \niii. As explained above, a locally or regionally appli-\ncable EPA action is reviewable in the D.C. Circuit only \nif (a) the action \u201cis based on a determination of nation-\nwide scope or effect\u201d and (b) EPA \u201cfinds and publishes \nthat such action is based on such a determination.\u201d  42 \nU.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  Even when the facts and law would \nsupport the specified finding, EPA has plenary discre-\ntion to decide whether to publish that finding, and the \nagency \u201cmay weigh any number of considerations\u201d in \nmaking that decision.  Sierra Club, 47 F.4th at 746; see \np. 33, supra.  For example, EPA may consider whether \nany petitions for review of a particular action would \nlikely contest EPA determinations of national concern, \nor instead would likely dispute EPA\u2019s understanding of \nlocal or regional circumstances.  For EPA actions in the \nlatter category, the agency may decline to publish the \nrelevant finding, thereby ensuring that the regional cir-\ncuit will have venue over any challenge to the action.   \nc. The limitations described above meaningfully \nconstrain the number of locally or regionally applicable \nactions that will be subject to D.C. Circuit review, while \nfurthering the congressional purpose embodied in Sec-\ntion 7607(b)(1) to promote efficient and uniform resolu-\n \nApril denial action announced a new approach to small-refinery ex-\nemptions, while the June denial action simply applied that approach \nto additional refineries.  That contention is overstated.  Both denial \nactions here stemmed from a single proposed denial that first an-\nnounced EPA\u2019s new approach to exemptions.  Pet. App. 48a, 193a; \nsee 86 Fed. Reg. at 70,999 (proposing to \u201cdeny all pending [exemp-\ntion] petitions\u201d based on the agency\u2019s determinations regarding the \nmeaning of disproportionate economic hardship and the market re-\nalities of refinery operations).  The fact that a short time passed be-\ntween the finalization of the two actions\u2014without any court consid-\nering the validity of EPA\u2019s new determinations\u2014is an insufficient \nbasis to distinguish between the actions for purposes of venue.  \n\n44 \n \ntion of disputed issues of national significance.  By con-\ntrast, respondents\u2019 interpretation would limit D.C. Cir-\ncuit review of locally or regionally applicable EPA ac-\ntions to a vanishingly small category.  Embracing that \ninterpretation would lead to the very problems Con-\ngress sought to avoid in amending the CAA\u2019s venue pro-\nvision to include the nationwide-scope-or-effect lan-\nguage.   \nThis case is illustrative.  As a result of the Fifth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s refusal to transfer this case, EPA now faces two \nmerits decisions from two different circuit courts that \naddressed substantially similar challenges to the same \ndenial actions.  The petitioners in both circuits focused \ntheir attacks on the statutory interpretation and eco-\nnomic analysis that EPA had adopted and applied na-\ntionwide, not on any refinery-specific EPA findings.  \nAnd EPA avoided further fragmentation of judicial re-\nview only because five other regional courts of appeals \ndismissed similar challenges for improper venue or \ntransferred challenges to the D.C. Circuit.     \nAlthough both the Fifth and D.C. Circuits ultimately \nvacated EPA\u2019s denial actions, the differences in reason-\ning between the two circuits may lead to different re-\nsults on remand.7  That would create a bifurcated RFS \n \n7  Most notably, the Fifth Circuit found that refineries had reason-\nably relied on EPA\u2019s prior approach to adjudicating exemption pe-\ntitions, such that the agency\u2019s consideration of updated economic in-\nformation regarding RFS compliance costs\u2014relating to the \u201cRIN \ncost passthrough principle\u201d\u2014created an impermissible retroactive \neffect.  Pet. App. 14a; see id. at 16a-23a.  The D.C. Circuit declined \nto reach that issue.  See Sinclair Wyoming Ref. Co. v. EPA, 114 \nF.4th 693, 714 n.12 (2024) (per curiam).  Under the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \nretroactivity analysis, EPA would be required to evaluate the re-\nmanded petitions under its prior approach, without considering up-\n \n\n45 \n \nprogram consisting of one program for remanded peti-\ntions for most of the nation, and a separate, more favor-\nable program for exemption claimants in the Fifth Cir-\ncuit.  That result is contrary to Congress\u2019s direction to \nensure a uniform, nationwide framework for increasing \nrenewable fuel use, see e.g., 42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(2)(A)(i) \nand (o)(2)(B)(ii)(III), and with Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s evi-\ndent purpose of ensuring efficient, uniform resolution of \nissues with national significance.  And if this Court en-\ndorses the Fifth Circuit\u2019s venue analysis, future EPA \nactions similar to the denial actions here can be ex-\npected to spawn litigation in several courts of appeals, \nwith a consequent increased waste of judicial resources \nand a heightened risk of inconsistent outcomes.  Noth-\ning in the statutory text requires that result, and the \nCourt should reject it.   \n \n \n \ndated economic analysis of a small refinery\u2019s compliance costs be-\nyond those contemplated by the DOE study and corresponding \nscoring matrix.  That aspect of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s opinion focuses \nnot on any refinery-specific circumstance, but on the economic anal-\nysis EPA used in assessing exemption petitions from refineries na-\ntionwide.  Under the D.C. Circuit\u2019s analysis, by contrast, EPA may \nconsider any updated economic information about a small refinery\u2019s \ncompliance costs that is relevant to assessing whether the refinery \nactually suffers disproportionate economic hardship. \n\n46 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThis Court should vacate the order of the court of \nappeals and remand with instructions to transfer the \ncase to the D.C. Circuit.   \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nDIMPLE CHAUDHARY \nActing General Counsel \nSUSANNAH WEAVER \nDeputy General Counsel \nGAUTAM SRINIVASAN \nAssociate General Counsel \nMATTHEW MARKS \nDeputy Associate General \nCounsel \nSUSAN STAHLE \nJEANHEE HONG \nAttorneys \nEnvironmental Protection \nAgency \n \nELIZABETH B.

For the 50 and 60 percent reductions, the \nAdministrator may make such an adjustment only \nif he determines that generally such reduction is \nnot commercially feasible for fuels made using a \n\n16a \n \nvariety of feedstocks, technologies, and processes \nto meet the applicable reduction. \n \n(B) \nAmount of adjustment \n \nIn promulgating regulations under this para-\ngraph, the specified 50 percent reduction in green-\nhouse gas emissions from advanced biofuel and in \nbiomass-based diesel may not be reduced below 40 \npercent.  The specified 20 percent reduction in \ngreenhouse gas emissions from renewable fuel \nmay not be reduced below 10 percent, and the \nspecified 60 percent reduction in greenhouse gas \nemissions from cellulosic biofuel may not be re-\nduced below 50 percent. \n \n(C) \nAdjusted reduction levels \n \nAn adjustment under this paragraph to a per-\ncent less than the specified 20 percent greenhouse \ngas reduction for renewable fuel shall be the min-\nimum possible adjustment, and the adjusted \ngreenhouse gas reduction shall be established by \nthe Administrator at the maximum achievable \nlevel, taking cost in consideration, for natural gas \nfired corn-based ethanol plants, allowing for the \nuse of a variety of technologies and processes.  \nAn adjustment in the 50 or 60 percent greenhouse \ngas levels shall be the minimum possible adjust-\nment for the fuel or fuels concerned, and the ad-\njusted greenhouse gas reduction shall be estab-\nlished at the maximum achievable level, taking \ncost in consideration, allowing for the use of a va-\nriety of feedstocks, technologies, and processes. \n \n \n \n \n\n17a \n \n \n(D) \n5-year review \n \nWhenever the Administrator makes any ad-\njustment under this paragraph, not later than 5 \nyears thereafter he shall review and revise (based \nupon the same criteria and standards as required \nfor the initial adjustment) the regulations estab-\nlishing the adjusted level. \n \n(E) \nSubsequent adjustments \n \nAfter the Administrator has promulgated a fi-\nnal rule under the last sentence of paragraph \n(2)(A)(i) with respect to the method of determin-\ning lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions, except as \nprovided in subparagraph (D), the Administrator \nmay not adjust the percent greenhouse gas reduc-\ntion levels unless he determines that there has \nbeen a significant change in the analytical meth-\nodology used for determining the lifecycle green-\nhouse gas emissions.  If he makes such determi-\nnation, he may adjust the 20, 50, or 60 percent re-\nduction levels through rulemaking using the crite-\nria and standards set forth in this paragraph. \n \n(F) \nLimit on upward adjustments \n \nIf, under subparagraph (D) or (E), the Admin-\nistrator revises a percent level adjusted as pro-\nvided in subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) to a \nhigher percent, such higher percent may not ex-\nceed the applicable percent specified in paragraph \n(2)(A)(i), (1)(D), (1)(B)(i), or (1)(E). \n \n(G) \nApplicability of adjustments \n \nIf the Administrator adjusts, or revises, a per-\ncent level referred to in this paragraph or makes \n\n18a \n \na change in the analytical methodology used for \ndetermining the lifecycle greenhouse gas emis-\nsions, such adjustment, revision, or change (or any \ncombination thereof\u200a) shall only apply to renewa-\nble fuel from new facilities that commence con-\nstruction after the effective date of such adjust-\nment, revision, or change. \n(5) Credit program \n \n(A) \nIn general \n \nThe regulations promulgated under paragraph \n(2)(A) shall provide\u2014 \n \n(i) \nfor the generation of an appropriate \namount of credits by any person that refines, \nblends, or imports gasoline that contains a \nquantity of renewable fuel that is greater than \nthe quantity required under paragraph (2); \n \n(ii) for the generation of an appropriate \namount of credits for biodiesel; and \n \n(iii) for the generation of credits by small \nrefineries in accordance with paragraph (9)(C). \n \n(B) \nUse of credits \n \nA person that generates credits under subpar-\nagraph (A) may use the credits, or transfer all or \na portion of the credits to another person, for the \npurpose of complying with paragraph (2). \n \n(C) \nDuration of credits \n \nA credit generated under this paragraph shall \nbe valid to show compliance for the 12 months as \nof the date of generation. \n\n19a \n \n \n(D) \nInability to generate or purchase sufficient \ncredits \n \nThe regulations promulgated under paragraph \n(2)(A) shall include provisions allowing any person \nthat is unable to generate or purchase sufficient \ncredits to meet the requirements of paragraph (2) \nto carry forward a renewable fuel deficit on condi-\ntion that the person, in the calendar year following \nthe year in which the renewable fuel deficit is  \ncreated\u2014 \n \n(i) \nachieves compliance with the renewa-\nble fuel requirement under paragraph (2); and \n \n(ii) generates or purchases additional re-\nnewable fuel credits to offset the renewable \nfuel deficit of the previous year. \n \n(E) \nCredits for additional renewable fuel \n \nThe Administrator may issue regulations \nproviding:  (i) for the generation of an appropri-\nate amount of credits by any person that refines, \nblends, or imports additional renewable fuels \nspecified by the Administrator; and (ii) for the use \nof such credits by the generator, or the transfer of \nall or a portion of the credits to another person, \nfor the purpose of complying with paragraph (2). \n(6) Seasonal variations in renewable fuel use \n \n(A) \nStudy \n \nFor each of calendar years 2006 through 2012, \nthe Administrator of the Energy Information Ad-\nministration shall conduct a study of renewable \nfuel blending to determine whether there are ex-\n\n20a \n \ncessive seasonal variations in the use of renewable \nfuel. \n \n(B) \nRegulation of excessive seasonal variations \n \nIf, for any calendar year, the Administrator of \nthe Energy Information Administration, based on \nthe study under subparagraph (A), makes the de-\nterminations specified in subparagraph (C), the \nAdministrator of the Environmental Protection \nAgency shall promulgate regulations to ensure \nthat 25 percent or more of the quantity of renew-\nable fuel necessary to meet the requirements of \nparagraph (2) is used during each of the 2 periods \nspecified in subparagraph (D) of each subsequent \ncalendar year. \n \n(C) \nDeterminations \n \nThe determinations referred to in subpara-\ngraph (B) are that\u2014 \n \n(i) \nless than 25 percent of the quantity of \nrenewable fuel necessary to meet the require-\nments of paragraph (2) has been used during 1 \nof the 2 periods specified in subparagraph (D) \nof the calendar year; \n \n(ii) a pattern of excessive seasonal varia-\ntion described in clause (i) will continue in sub-\nsequent calendar years; and \n \n(iii) promulgating regulations or other re-\nquirements to impose a 25 percent or more sea-\nsonal use of renewable fuels will not prevent or \ninterfere with the attainment of national ambi-\nent air quality standards or significantly in-\ncrease the price of motor fuels to the consumer. \n\n21a \n \n \n(D) \nPeriods \n \nThe 2 periods referred to in this paragraph \nare\u2014 \n \n \n \n(i) \nApril through September; and \n \n(ii) January through March and October \nthrough December. \n \n(E) \nExclusion \n \nRenewable fuel blended or consumed in calen-\ndar year 2006 in a State that has received a waiver \nunder section 7543(b) of this title shall not be in-\ncluded in the study under subparagraph (A). \n \n(F) \nState exemption from seasonality require-\nments \n \nNotwithstanding any other provision of law, \nthe seasonality requirement relating to renewable \nfuel use established by this paragraph shall not \napply to any State that has received a waiver un-\nder section 7543(b) of this title or any State de-\npendent on refineries in such State for gasoline \nsupplies. \n(7) Waivers \n \n(A) \nIn general \n \nThe Administrator, in consultation with the \nSecretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of En-\nergy, may waive the requirements of paragraph \n(2) in whole or in part on petition by one or more \nStates, by any person subject to the requirements \nof this subsection, or by the Administrator on his \nown motion by reducing the national quantity of \nrenewable fuel required under paragraph (2)\u2014 \n\n22a \n \n \n(i) \nbased on a determination by the Ad-\nministrator, after public notice and opportunity \nfor comment, that implementation of the re-\nquirement would severely harm the economy \nor environment of a State, a region, or the \nUnited States; or \n \n(ii) based on a determination by the Ad-\nministrator, after public notice and opportunity \nfor comment, that there is an inadequate do-\nmestic supply. \n \n(B) \nPetitions for waivers \n \nThe Administrator, in consultation with the \nSecretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of En-\nergy, shall approve or disapprove a petition for a \nwaiver of the requirements of paragraph (2) \nwithin 90 days after the date on which the petition \nis received by the Administrator. \n \n(C) \nTermination of waivers \n \nA waiver granted under subparagraph (A) shall \nterminate after 1 year, but may be renewed by the \nAdministrator after consultation with the Secre-\ntary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Energy. \n \n(D) \nCellulosic biofuel \n \n(i) \nFor any calendar year for which the pro-\njected volume of cellulosic biofuel production is \nless than the minimum applicable volume estab-\nlished under paragraph (2)(B), as determined by \nthe Administrator based on the estimate provided \nunder paragraph (3)(A), not later than November \n30 of the preceding calendar year, the Administra-\ntor shall reduce the applicable volume of cellulosic \n\n23a \n \nbiofuel required under paragraph (2)(B) to the \nprojected volume available during that calendar \nyear.  For any calendar year in which the Admin-\nistrator makes such a reduction, the Administra-\ntor may also reduce the applicable volume of re-\nnewable fuel and advanced biofuels requirement \nestablished under paragraph (2)(B) by the same or \na lesser volume. \n \n(ii) Whenever the Administrator reduces the \nminimum cellulosic biofuel volume under this sub-\nparagraph, the Administrator shall make availa-\nble for sale cellulosic biofuel credits at the higher \nof $0.25 per gallon or the amount by which $3.00 \nper gallon exceeds the average wholesale price of \na gallon of gasoline in the United States.  Such \namounts shall be adjusted for inflation by the Ad-\nministrator for years after 2008. \n \n(iii) Eighteen months after December 19, 2007, \nthe Administrator shall promulgate regulations to \ngovern the issuance of credits under this subpara-\ngraph.  The regulations shall set forth the \nmethod for determining the exact price of credits \nin the event of a waiver.  The price of such credits \nshall not be changed more frequently than once \neach quarter.  These regulations shall include \nsuch provisions, including limiting the credits\u2019 \nuses and useful life, as the Administrator deems \nappropriate to assist market liquidity and trans-\nparency, to provide appropriate certainty for reg-\nulated entities and renewable fuel producers, and \nto limit any potential misuse of cellulosic biofuel \ncredits to reduce the use of other renewable fuels, \nand for such other purposes as the Administrator \n\n24a \n \ndetermines will help achieve the goals of this sub-\nsection.  The regulations shall limit the number \nof cellulosic biofuel credits for any calendar year \nto the minimum applicable volume (as reduced un-\nder this subparagraph) of cellulosic biofuel for \nthat year. \n \n(E) \nBiomass-based diesel \n \n \n(i) \nMarket evaluation \n \nThe Administrator, in consultation with the \nSecretary of Energy and the Secretary of Ag-\nriculture, shall periodically evaluate the impact \nof the biomass-based diesel requirements es-\ntablished under this paragraph on the price of \ndiesel fuel. \n \n \n(ii) \nWaiver \n \nIf the Administrator determines that there \nis a significant renewable feedstock disruption \nor other market circumstances that would \nmake the price of biomass-based diesel fuel in-\ncrease significantly, the Administrator, in con-\nsultation with the Secretary of Energy and the \nSecretary of Agriculture, shall issue an order \nto reduce, for up to a 60-day period, the quan-\ntity of biomass-based diesel required under \nsubparagraph (A) by an appropriate quantity \nthat does not exceed 15 percent of the applica-\nble annual requirement for biomass-based die-\nsel.  For any calendar year in which the Ad-\nministrator makes a reduction under this sub-\nparagraph, the Administrator may also reduce \nthe applicable volume of renewable fuel and ad-\nvanced biofuels requirement established under \n\n25a \n \nparagraph (2)(B) by the same or a lesser vol-\nume. \n \n \n(iii) Extensions \n \nIf the Administrator determines that the \nfeedstock disruption or circumstances de-\nscribed in clause (ii) is continuing beyond the \n60-day period described in clause (ii) or this \nclause, the Administrator, in consultation with \nthe Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of \nAgriculture, may issue an order to reduce, for \nup to an additional 60-day period, the quantity \nof biomass-based diesel required under sub-\nparagraph (A) by an appropriate quantity that \ndoes not exceed an additional 15 percent of the \napplicable annual requirement for biomass-\nbased diesel. \n \n(F) \nModification of applicable volumes \n \nFor any of the tables in paragraph (2)(B), if the \nAdministrator waives\u2014 \n \n(i) \nat least 20 percent of the applicable vol-\nume requirement set forth in any such table for \n2 consecutive years; or \n \n(ii) at least 50 percent of such volume re-\nquirement for a single year, \nthe Administrator shall promulgate a rule (within \n1 year after issuing such waiver) that modifies the \napplicable volumes set forth in the table con-\ncerned for all years following the final year to \nwhich the waiver applies, except that no such mod-\nification in applicable volumes shall be made for \nany year before 2016.  In promulgating such a \n\n26a \n \nrule, the Administrator shall comply with the pro-\ncesses, criteria, and standards set forth in para-\ngraph (2)(B)(ii). \n(8) Study and waiver for initial year of program \n \n(A) \nIn general \n \nNot later than 180 days after August 8, 2005, \nthe Secretary of Energy shall conduct for the Ad-\nministrator a study assessing whether the renew-\nable fuel requirement under paragraph (2) will \nlikely result in significant adverse impacts on con-\nsumers in 2006, on a national, regional, or State \nbasis. \n \n(B) \nRequired evaluations \n \n \nThe study shall evaluate renewable fuel\u2014 \n \n \n \n(i) \nsupplies and prices; \n \n \n \n(ii) blendstock supplies; and \n \n(iii) supply and distribution system capabil-\nities. \n \n(C) \nRecommendations by the Secretary \n \nBased on the results of the study, the Secretary \nof Energy shall make specific recommendations to \nthe Administrator concerning waiver of the re-\nquirements of paragraph (2), in whole or in part, \nto prevent any adverse impacts described in sub-\nparagraph (A). \n \n(D) \nWaiver \n \n \n(i) \nIn general \n \nNot later than 270 days after August 8, 2005, \nthe Administrator shall, if and to the extent \n\n27a \n \nrecommended by the Secretary of Energy un-\nder subparagraph (C), waive, in whole or in \npart, the renewable fuel requirement under \nparagraph (2) by reducing the national quan-\ntity of renewable fuel required under para-\ngraph (2) in calendar year 2006. \n \n \n(ii) \nNo effect on waiver authority \n \nClause (i) does not limit the authority of the \nAdministrator to waive the requirements of \nparagraph (2) in whole, or in part, under para-\ngraph (7). \n(9) Small refineries \n \n(A) \nTemporary exemption \n \n \n(i) \nIn general \n \nThe requirements of paragraph (2) shall not \napply to small refineries until calendar year \n2011. \n \n \n(ii) \nExtension of exemption \n \n \n \n(I) \nStudy by Secretary of Energy \n \nNot later than December 31, 2008, the \nSecretary of Energy shall conduct for the \nAdministrator a study to determine whether \ncompliance with the requirements of para-\ngraph (2) would impose a disproportionate \neconomic hardship on small refineries. \n \n \n \n(II) \nExtension of exemption \n \nIn the case of a small refinery that the \nSecretary of Energy determines under sub-\nclause (I) would be subject to a dispropor-\n\n28a \n \ntionate economic hardship if required to \ncomply with paragraph (2), the Administra-\ntor shall extend the exemption under clause \n(i) for the small refinery for a period of not \nless than 2 additional years. \n \n(B) \nPetitions based on disproportionate eco-\nnomic hardship \n \n \n(i) \nExtension of exemption \n \nA small refinery may at any time petition \nthe Administrator for an extension of the ex-\nemption under subparagraph (A) for the reason \nof disproportionate economic hardship. \n \n \n(ii) \nEvaluation of petitions \n \nIn evaluating a petition under clause (i), the \nAdministrator, in consultation with the Secre-\ntary of Energy, shall consider the findings of \nthe study under subparagraph (A)(ii) and other \neconomic factors. \n \n \n(iii) Deadline for action on petitions \n \nThe Administrator shall act on any petition \nsubmitted by a small refinery for a hardship ex-\nemption not later than 90 days after the date of \nreceipt of the petition. \n \n(C) \nCredit program \n \nIf a small refinery notifies the Administrator \nthat the small refinery waives the exemption un-\nder subparagraph (A), the regulations promul-\ngated under paragraph (2)(A) shall provide for the \ngeneration of credits by the small refinery under \n\n29a \n \nparagraph (5) beginning in the calendar year fol-\nlowing the date of notification. \n \n(D) \nOpt-in for small refineries \n \nA small refinery shall be subject to the require-\nments of paragraph (2) if the small refinery noti-\nfies the Administrator that the small refinery \nwaives the exemption under subparagraph (A). \n(10) Ethanol market concentration analysis \n \n(A) \nAnalysis \n \n \n(i) \nIn general \n \nNot later than 180 days after August 8, 2005, \nand annually thereafter, the Federal Trade \nCommission shall perform a market concentra-\ntion analysis of the ethanol production industry \nusing the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index to de-\ntermine whether there is sufficient competition \namong industry participants to avoid price- \nsetting and other anticompetitive behavior. \n \n \n(ii) \nScoring \n \nFor the purpose of scoring under clause (i) \nusing the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, all \nmarketing arrangements among industry par-\nticipants shall be considered. \n \n(B) \nReport \n \nNot later than December 1, 2005, and annually \nthereafter, the Federal Trade Commission shall \nsubmit to Congress and the Administrator a re-\nport on the results of the market concentration \nanalysis performed under subparagraph (A)(i). \n\n30a \n \n(11) Periodic reviews \n \nTo allow for the appropriate adjustment of the re-\nquirements described in subparagraph (B) of para-\ngraph (2), the Administrator shall conduct periodic \nreviews of\u2014 \n \n \n(A) \nexisting technologies;

My previous actions have likely focused on the petitioner's (EPA's) arguments for why jurisdiction is exclusive. This search specifically targets the counterarguments from the respondents (the refineries), which is the other essential half of the legal dispute. Understanding the respondents' statutory interpretation of the Clean Air Act's judicial review provisions is critical to evaluating the merits and predicting how the Justices will resolve the textual and structural questions. Without this information, any prediction would be one-sided and incomplete. Therefore, the Task EIG is very high. The Design EIG is also significant because it reinforces a core, systematic strategy for legal prediction: after understanding the petitioner's position on a legal question, the next logical and necessary step is to understand the respondent's. Successfully executing this step confirms the validity of this structured, adversarial approach to information gathering.",

Main Street, Suite 201\nMadison, WI 53703 \n \n\n \nQUESTION PRESENTED \nThe Clean Air Act requires the Environmental Protec-\ntion Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) to grant an exemption from the Act\u2019s \nRenewable Fuel Standard (\u201cRFS\u201d) to a small refinery \nwhen compliance with the RFS would cause the refinery \ndisproportionate economic hardship in a given year.  \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(i). The six small refinery re-\nspondents here separately petitioned EPA for hardship \nexemptions for particular compliance years. EPA con-\ncluded, after \u201cconsider[ing] each [respondent\u2019s] individual \nrefinery information,\u201d that each of the respondents was \nnot entitled to hardship relief and denied the petitions. \nPet.App.14a-15a. Respondents then petitioned for judicial \nreview as permitted by the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1). The question presented is:  \nWhether an EPA decision denying a small refinery\u2019s \nRFS hardship petition is a \u201clocally or regionally applica-\nble\u201d action, such that a court challenge to that action is \nproperly venued in a regional circuit court, or is instead a \n\u201cnationally applicable\u201d action or an action \u201cbased on a  \ndetermination of nationwide scope or effect\u201d that must be \nchallenged only in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. \nCircuit. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). \n \n \n\n \nii \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nStatutory Provision Involved ............................................. 1 \nIntroduction ......................................................................... 3 \nStatement ............................................................................. 6 \nA.

App.1a-31a, infra. \n \n \n\n \n3 \nINTRODUCTION \nThe Clean Air Act (\u201cCAA\u201d or \u201cAct\u201d) assigns the venue \nfor a petition for judicial review of final agency action by \nasking whether the challenged action is \u201cnationally appli-\ncable\u201d (reviewed by the D.C. Circuit) or \u201clocally or region-\nally applicable\u201d (reviewed by the regional circuit courts). \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1).1 Determining venue thus requires \nfocusing with precision on the \u201caction\u201d that the Environ-\nmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) was authorized by the \nCAA to take: the \u201cfinal action taken \u2026 under this chap-\nter.\u201d Ibid. (\u201c[T]his chapter\u201d is the CAA.) \nOnce the final action is properly identified, the venue \nprovision is straightforward. Most EPA actions under the \nAct are rulemakings or similar actions that apply through-\nout the entire nation, or else are adjudications or similar \ndecisions involving individual States or regulated entities. \nThe former go to the D.C. Circuit, the latter to the re-\ngional circuit courts\u2014save only in the exceptional circum-\nstance where the CAA\u2019s text directs EPA to base a local \naction on a \u201cdetermination\u201d about the whole nation. \nApplying those statutory instructions here shows why \nthe Fifth Circuit below got the venue question right. This \ncase concerns a type of statutory forbearance from the \nCAA\u2019s Renewable Fuel Standard (\u201cRFS\u201d) that affects \nonly small refineries. Small refineries like respondents \nmay petition EPA for an exemption from the RFS obliga-\ntion by showing that they will face disproportionate eco-\nnomic hardship from compliance with the RFS in a given \nyear. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(A)-(B). Until a presidential administra-\ntion change in 2021, EPA had repeatedly acknowledged \nthat its decisions on small refineries\u2019 hardship petitions \n \n1  All statutory citations are to Title 42 of the United States \nCode. \n\n \n4 \nare quintessential locally applicable actions that Section \n7607(b)(1) refers to the regional circuits. That\u2019s because \neach EPA \u201cfinal action\u201d on a hardship-exemption petition \nadjudicates the rights of only one small refinery located in \none place, and the \u201cchapter\u201d (the CAA) requires those ac-\ntions to be based on consideration of each small refinery\u2019s \nown economic hardship. \u00a7 7607(b)(1); see \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B). \nEPA changed its position on venue and started delib-\nerately attempting to re-direct judicial challenges to its \npreferred court, the D.C. Circuit, only after it suffered a \nstring of defeats in regional circuit courts that found EPA \nhad wrongly decided hardship petitions. EPA now argues \nthat, because it published its decisions on multiple small \nrefineries\u2019 pending hardship petitions bundled together in \ntwo explanation documents (denying every pending peti-\ntion), it was able to convert what it has long agreed were \nlocally applicable final actions into just two nationally  \napplicable actions. EPA was transparent about its goal of \nmaking the D.C. Circuit the only court allowed to review \nits latest denial decisions. \nEPA\u2019s new venue position is contrary to the CAA\u2019s \ntext, and the Fifth Circuit correctly rejected it. EPA was \nable to produce the bundled decisions only by ignoring the \nstatutory command to decide hardship petitions individu-\nally as they come in. More fundamentally, the two expla-\nnation documents were bundles of individual final actions \nunder the CAA. EPA\u2019s choice about how to publish its  \ndecisions cannot change the nature of the \u201cfinal action \ntaken \u2026 under this chapter,\u201d which is what matters for \nvenue. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). It is the statutory text\u2014\u201cth[e] chap-\nter\u201d\u2014that establishes what actions EPA is permitted to \ntake. And here, every relevant provision of the chapter \nconfirms that EPA was required to produce individualized \n\n \n5 \nfinal actions based on individual petitioning refineries\u2019 \neconomic circumstances.  \nIn fact, that is just what EPA did. EPA itself has \nstated that it denied all of the small-refinery respondents\u2019 \nRFS hardship petitions because it \u201cdetermin[ed],\u201d after \n\u201cconsider[ing] each [refinery\u2019s] individual refinery infor-\nmation,\u201d that each respondent was not experiencing dis-\nproportionate economic hardship. Pet.App.14a-15a. EPA \nconcluded, after examining each respondent\u2019s evidence, \nthat each ostensibly passes on 100% of its RFS compliance \ncosts in the price of the fuel it sells. Those were the con-\nclusions on which EPA based its decisions to deny hard-\nship relief to these small-refinery respondents, each of \nwhich received an individualized explanation from EPA \nanalyzing its own economic evidence. \nMultiple courts of appeals (including the D.C. Circuit) \nhave since held that EPA\u2019s merits reasoning about the \nsmall refineries\u2019 ability to pass through their RFS compli-\nance costs was arbitrary and capricious and unsupported \nby the record evidence. But the venue issue before this \nCourt is simpler. To borrow Judge Silberman\u2019s descrip-\ntion of the venue provision that EPA endorses (U.S. Br. \n18): EPA\u2019s answer to whether a petitioning small refinery \nlike Calumet Shreveport located in Shreveport, Louisi-\nana, does or does not successfully pass through its RFS \ncompliance costs in its fuel sales hardly qualifies as a \u201creg-\nulatory issue[ ] of national importance\u201d that belongs in the \nD.C. Circuit. National Env\u2019t Dev. Ass\u2019ns Clean Air Pro-\nject v. EPA, 891 F.3d. 1041, 1054 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (Silber-\nman, J., concurring). \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment should be affirmed. \n\n \n6 \nSTATEMENT \nA. Statutory and regulatory background \n1. Venue for petitions for review under the Clean \nAir Act \nSection 7607(b)(1) governs \u201c[j]udicial review\u201d of \u201cpeti-\ntions for review\u201d of EPA\u2019s \u201cfinal action[s] under this chap-\nter,\u201d i.e., under the Clean Air Act. See Kentucky v. EPA, \n123 F.4th 447, 458, 461 (6th Cir. 2024); 42 U.S.C. Ch. 85, \nCodification Note (\u201cthis chapter\u201d is the CAA). As relevant \nhere, Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s venue instructions consist of \nthree \u201clengthy\u201d sentences. Kentucky, 123 F.4th at 458.  \na. The first sentence describes the proper venue for \nchallenging EPA final actions that apply to the nation as \na whole. That sentence begins by enumerating several \nCAA provisions authorizing EPA to take national actions. \nFor example, when EPA promulgates a national primary \nor secondary air quality standard under Section 7412, or \nsets a standard of performance for all new stationary \nsources of emissions under Section 7411, challenges to \nthose national actions \u201cmay be filed only in\u201d the D.C. Cir-\ncuit. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). In 1977, Congress amended the venue \nprovision to add a catchall phrase to that sentence: In  \naddition to the enumerated national actions, \u201cany other \nnationally applicable regulations promulgated, or final  \naction taken, by the Administrator under this chapter\u201d \nare reviewable only in the D.C. Circuit. Ibid.; see Clean \nAir Act Amendments of 1977, Pub. L. No. 95-95, 91 Stat. \n685 (Aug. 7, 1977).2 \n \n \n2  For ease of reference, the 1970 and 1982 versions of the \nvenue provision (the latter including the 1977 amendments) are \nprovided at App., infra, 29a and 30a, respectively. \n\n \n7 \nb. The second sentence follows the same basic struc-\nture but for non-national final agency actions. It first enu-\nmerates CAA provisions authorizing EPA to take actions \nthat apply to less than the whole country, and it makes \nthose actions reviewable only in regional circuit courts. \nFor example, when EPA approves or promulgates a state \nimplementation plan under Sections 7410 or 7411(d), a \nchallenge to that action \u201cmay be filed only in the United \nStates Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit.\u201d \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1). The second sentence of Section 7607(b)(1), \nlike the first, also includes a catchall phrase added by the \nsame 1977 amendment: \u201cany other final action of the  \nAdministrator under this chapter \u2026 which is locally or  \nregionally applicable\u201d is reviewable only in \u201cthe appropri-\nate circuit\u201d court. Ibid.  \nIdentifying which circuit court is \u201cappropriate\u201d for  \nreviewing local or regional final action is usually easy. \nThat\u2019s because for these EPA actions, the relevant sub-\nstantive CAA provision makes it clear that the action  \naffects particular regulated facilities or States, each of \nwhich is governed by a regional circuit court. When EPA \npromulgates a regional action that happens to touch more \nthan one federal circuit\u2014for example, approving or re-\njecting an implementation plan for the Metropolitan Kan-\nsas City air-quality-control region\u2014there may be more \nthan one appropriate circuit. \nc. The courts of appeals and EPA agree that, to  \nassess the national vs. local applicability of an EPA action \nfor purposes of Section 7607(b)(1), courts look only \u201cto the \nface\u201d of the action as that action is authorized by the \nCAA\u2014not to the challenger\u2019s arguments in the petition \nfor review, and not to the effects of the action or the rea-\nsoning within it. American Rd. & Transp. Builders Ass\u2019n \nv. EPA, 705 F.3d 453, 456 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (Kavanaugh, \n\n \n8 \nJ.); see also, e.g., ATK Launch Sys., Inc. v. EPA, 651 F.3d \n1194, 1197 (10th Cir. 2011); U.S. Br. 20 (invoking \u201cthe face \nof \u201d the actions). That focus on what action EPA took fol-\nlows from the statutory instruction to look to the \u201cfinal ac-\ntion \u2026 under this chapter\u201d to resolve venue. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). \nThe textual structure of Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s first two \nsentences\u2014enumerated lists of CAA actions followed by \ncatchall phrases\u2014indicates that courts should apply the \ncatchall phrases by reasoning by analogy to the enumer-\nated provisions. The catchall phrases use a \u201ccollective \nterm\u201d\u2014any other final action\u2014\u201cat the end of a list of spe-\ncific items,\u201d so the collective term is \u201ccontrolled and  \ndefined by reference to the specific classes that precede \nit.\u201d Fischer v. United States, 603 U.S. 480, 487 (2024) \n(ejusdem generis canon) (cleaned up); see Kentucky, 123 \nF.4th at 460 (using ejusdem generis to interpret Section \n7607(b)(1)). Thus, an EPA final action pursuant to an  \nunenumerated CAA provision is \u201cnationally applicable\u201d if \nit applies to the whole nation like the enumerated actions \nin the first sentence of Section 7607(b)(1) do. And a final  \naction is \u201clocally or regionally applicable\u201d if it applies to \nless than the whole nation, as the enumerated CAA  \nactions in the second sentence do. Ibid. \nd. The third sentence contemplates a narrow excep-\ntion for certain rare EPA actions that, though locally or \nregionally applicable, are \u201cbased on a determination of  \nnationwide scope or effect.\u201d \u00a7 7607(b)(1). That sentence \nwas added by the same 1977 amendment referenced \nabove, prompted by a recommendation from the Adminis-\ntrative Conference of the United States that included a \nstatement from EPA General Counsel William Frick. See \n41 Fed. Reg. 56,767 (Dec. 30, 1976).  \nFrick had identified a circumstance where the third-\nsentence exception was needed. 41 Fed. Reg. at 56,768-\n\n \n9 \n56,769. Under a particular CAA provision at the time \n(since repealed), EPA could grant extensions of a State\u2019s \nattainment date for certain national ambient air quality \nstandards\u2014actions that were locally applicable\u2014only \u201cif \nafter review ... the Administrator determine[d] that,\u201d \namong other things, regulated emission sources were  \n\u201cunable to comply with the [applicable] requirements \u2026 \nbecause the necessary technology or other alternatives \nare not available or will not be available soon enough to \npermit compliance.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857c-5(e) (1973) (empha-\nsis added); see NRDC v. EPA, 475 F.2d 968 (D.C. Cir. \n1973) (explaining the available-technology determination \nand corresponding extension action). \nFrick\u2019s statement, which the government agrees (U.S. \nBr. 37) was the genesis of the third sentence in Sec-\ntion 7607(b)(1), illustrates how that exception works: If \nthe statutory text requires a particular EPA action to \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n50: 20250121131752371_2025.01.21_No.2023-122920Proof20of20Service.json (score: 0.498)\nNos. 23-1229\nINTHE\nSupreme Court of the Cnited States\n\nENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY,\nPetitioner,\n\nCALUMET SHREVEPORT REFINING, LLC, et al,\n\u2018Respondents.\n\"AFFIDAVIT OF SERVICE\nTHEREBY CERTIFY that all parties required tobe served, have been served, on this 21\" day\nof January, 2026, in accordance with U.S, Supreme Court Rule 29.3, three (3) copies of the\n{foregoing BRIEF FOR THE SMALL REFINERY RESPONDENTS by placing said copies\nin the U.S. mai, first class postage prepaid, addrossed as attached.\n\nlizabeth Prelogar Shelby Leigh Dyl\nSolicitor General ofthe United States Pillsbury Winthrop\nUnited States Department of Justice \u2018Shaw Pittman LLP\n950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW 1700 17 Stroet, NW\nWashington, DC 20530-0001 Washington, DC 20036\n(202) 614-2217 (202) 663.9010\nSupremeCtBriefs@USDOJ.gov shelby.dylapillsburylaw.com\nSeth P.

Main Street, Suite 201\nMadison, WI 53703 \n \n\n \nQUESTION PRESENTED \nThe Clean Air Act requires the Environmental Protec-\ntion Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) to grant an exemption from the Act\u2019s \nRenewable Fuel Standard (\u201cRFS\u201d) to a small refinery \nwhen compliance with the RFS would cause the refinery \ndisproportionate economic hardship in a given year.  \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(i). The six small refinery re-\nspondents here separately petitioned EPA for hardship \nexemptions for particular compliance years. EPA con-\ncluded, after \u201cconsider[ing] each [respondent\u2019s] individual \nrefinery information,\u201d that each of the respondents was \nnot entitled to hardship relief and denied the petitions. \nPet.App.14a-15a. Respondents then petitioned for judicial \nreview as permitted by the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1). The question presented is:  \nWhether an EPA decision denying a small refinery\u2019s \nRFS hardship petition is a \u201clocally or regionally applica-\nble\u201d action, such that a court challenge to that action is \nproperly venued in a regional circuit court, or is instead a \n\u201cnationally applicable\u201d action or an action \u201cbased on a  \ndetermination of nationwide scope or effect\u201d that must be \nchallenged only in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. \nCircuit. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). \n \n \n\n \nii \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nStatutory Provision Involved ............................................. 1 \nIntroduction ......................................................................... 3 \nStatement ............................................................................. 6 \nA.

A petition for review of the Administrator\u2019s  \naction in approving or promulgating any implementation \nplan under section 7410 of this title or section 7411(d) of \nthis title, any order under section 7411(j) of this title,  \nunder section 7412 of this title, under section 7419 of this \ntitle, or under section 7420 of this title, or his action under \nsection 1857c-10(c)(2)(A), (B), or (C) of this title (as in  \neffect before August 7, 1977) or under regulations there-\nunder, or revising regulations for enhanced monitoring \nand compliance certification programs under section \n7414(a)(3) of this title, or any other final action of the  \nAdministrator under this chapter (including any denial or \ndisapproval by the Administrator under subchapter I) \nwhich is locally or regionally applicable may be filed only \nin the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate \ncircuit. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence a petition \nfor review of any action referred to in such sentence may \nbe filed only in the United States Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia if such action is based on a determi-\nnation of nationwide scope or effect and if in taking such \naction the Administrator finds and publishes that such  \naction is based on such a determination. \n* \nThis and other pertinent statutory provisions are  \nreprinted in the appendix to this brief. App.1a-31a, infra. \n \n \n\n \n3 \nINTRODUCTION \nThe Clean Air Act (\u201cCAA\u201d or \u201cAct\u201d) assigns the venue \nfor a petition for judicial review of final agency action by \nasking whether the challenged action is \u201cnationally appli-\ncable\u201d (reviewed by the D.C. Circuit) or \u201clocally or region-\nally applicable\u201d (reviewed by the regional circuit courts). \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1).1 Determining venue thus requires \nfocusing with precision on the \u201caction\u201d that the Environ-\nmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) was authorized by the \nCAA to take: the \u201cfinal action taken \u2026 under this chap-\nter.\u201d Ibid. (\u201c[T]his chapter\u201d is the CAA.) \nOnce the final action is properly identified, the venue \nprovision is straightforward. Most EPA actions under the \nAct are rulemakings or similar actions that apply through-\nout the entire nation, or else are adjudications or similar \ndecisions involving individual States or regulated entities. \nThe former go to the D.C. Circuit, the latter to the re-\ngional circuit courts\u2014save only in the exceptional circum-\nstance where the CAA\u2019s text directs EPA to base a local \naction on a \u201cdetermination\u201d about the whole nation. \nApplying those statutory instructions here shows why \nthe Fifth Circuit below got the venue question right. This \ncase concerns a type of statutory forbearance from the \nCAA\u2019s Renewable Fuel Standard (\u201cRFS\u201d) that affects \nonly small refineries. Small refineries like respondents \nmay petition EPA for an exemption from the RFS obliga-\ntion by showing that they will face disproportionate eco-\nnomic hardship from compliance with the RFS in a given \nyear. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(A)-(B). Until a presidential administra-\ntion change in 2021, EPA had repeatedly acknowledged \nthat its decisions on small refineries\u2019 hardship petitions \n \n1  All statutory citations are to Title 42 of the United States \nCode. \n\n \n4 \nare quintessential locally applicable actions that Section \n7607(b)(1) refers to the regional circuits. That\u2019s because \neach EPA \u201cfinal action\u201d on a hardship-exemption petition \nadjudicates the rights of only one small refinery located in \none place, and the \u201cchapter\u201d (the CAA) requires those ac-\ntions to be based on consideration of each small refinery\u2019s \nown economic hardship. \u00a7 7607(b)(1); see \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B). \nEPA changed its position on venue and started delib-\nerately attempting to re-direct judicial challenges to its \npreferred court, the D.C. Circuit, only after it suffered a \nstring of defeats in regional circuit courts that found EPA \nhad wrongly decided hardship petitions. EPA now argues \nthat, because it published its decisions on multiple small \nrefineries\u2019 pending hardship petitions bundled together in \ntwo explanation documents (denying every pending peti-\ntion), it was able to convert what it has long agreed were \nlocally applicable final actions into just two nationally  \napplicable actions. EPA was transparent about its goal of \nmaking the D.C. Circuit the only court allowed to review \nits latest denial decisions. \nEPA\u2019s new venue position is contrary to the CAA\u2019s \ntext, and the Fifth Circuit correctly rejected it. EPA was \nable to produce the bundled decisions only by ignoring the \nstatutory command to decide hardship petitions individu-\nally as they come in. More fundamentally, the two expla-\nnation documents were bundles of individual final actions \nunder the CAA. EPA\u2019s choice about how to publish its  \ndecisions cannot change the nature of the \u201cfinal action \ntaken \u2026 under this chapter,\u201d which is what matters for \nvenue. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). It is the statutory text\u2014\u201cth[e] chap-\nter\u201d\u2014that establishes what actions EPA is permitted to \ntake. And here, every relevant provision of the chapter \nconfirms that EPA was required to produce individualized \n\n \n5 \nfinal actions based on individual petitioning refineries\u2019 \neconomic circumstances.  \nIn fact, that is just what EPA did. EPA itself has \nstated that it denied all of the small-refinery respondents\u2019 \nRFS hardship petitions because it \u201cdetermin[ed],\u201d after \n\u201cconsider[ing] each [refinery\u2019s] individual refinery infor-\nmation,\u201d that each respondent was not experiencing dis-\nproportionate economic hardship. Pet.App.14a-15a. EPA \nconcluded, after examining each respondent\u2019s evidence, \nthat each ostensibly passes on 100% of its RFS compliance \ncosts in the price of the fuel it sells. Those were the con-\nclusions on which EPA based its decisions to deny hard-\nship relief to these small-refinery respondents, each of \nwhich received an individualized explanation from EPA \nanalyzing its own economic evidence. \nMultiple courts of appeals (including the D.C. Circuit) \nhave since held that EPA\u2019s merits reasoning about the \nsmall refineries\u2019 ability to pass through their RFS compli-\nance costs was arbitrary and capricious and unsupported \nby the record evidence. But the venue issue before this \nCourt is simpler. To borrow Judge Silberman\u2019s descrip-\ntion of the venue provision that EPA endorses (U.S. Br. \n18): EPA\u2019s answer to whether a petitioning small refinery \nlike Calumet Shreveport located in Shreveport, Louisi-\nana, does or does not successfully pass through its RFS \ncompliance costs in its fuel sales hardly qualifies as a \u201creg-\nulatory issue[ ] of national importance\u201d that belongs in the \nD.C. Circuit. National Env\u2019t Dev. Ass\u2019ns Clean Air Pro-\nject v. EPA, 891 F.3d. 1041, 1054 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (Silber-\nman, J., concurring). \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment should be affirmed. \n\n \n6 \nSTATEMENT \nA. Statutory and regulatory background \n1. Venue for petitions for review under the Clean \nAir Act \nSection 7607(b)(1) governs \u201c[j]udicial review\u201d of \u201cpeti-\ntions for review\u201d of EPA\u2019s \u201cfinal action[s] under this chap-\nter,\u201d i.e., under the Clean Air Act. See Kentucky v. EPA, \n123 F.4th 447, 458, 461 (6th Cir. 2024); 42 U.S.C. Ch. 85, \nCodification Note (\u201cthis chapter\u201d is the CAA). As relevant \nhere, Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s venue instructions consist of \nthree \u201clengthy\u201d sentences. Kentucky, 123 F.4th at 458.  \na. The first sentence describes the proper venue for \nchallenging EPA final actions that apply to the nation as \na whole. That sentence begins by enumerating several \nCAA provisions authorizing EPA to take national actions. \nFor example, when EPA promulgates a national primary \nor secondary air quality standard under Section 7412, or \nsets a standard of performance for all new stationary \nsources of emissions under Section 7411, challenges to \nthose national actions \u201cmay be filed only in\u201d the D.C. Cir-\ncuit. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). In 1977, Congress amended the venue \nprovision to add a catchall phrase to that sentence: In  \naddition to the enumerated national actions, \u201cany other \nnationally applicable regulations promulgated, or final  \naction taken, by the Administrator under this chapter\u201d \nare reviewable only in the D.C. Circuit. Ibid.; see Clean \nAir Act Amendments of 1977, Pub. L. No. 95-95, 91 Stat. \n685 (Aug. 7, 1977).2 \n \n \n2  For ease of reference, the 1970 and 1982 versions of the \nvenue provision (the latter including the 1977 amendments) are \nprovided at App., infra, 29a and 30a, respectively. \n\n \n7 \nb. The second sentence follows the same basic struc-\nture but for non-national final agency actions. It first enu-\nmerates CAA provisions authorizing EPA to take actions \nthat apply to less than the whole country, and it makes \nthose actions reviewable only in regional circuit courts. \nFor example, when EPA approves or promulgates a state \nimplementation plan under Sections 7410 or 7411(d), a \nchallenge to that action \u201cmay be filed only in the United \nStates Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit.\u201d \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1). The second sentence of Section 7607(b)(1), \nlike the first, also includes a catchall phrase added by the \nsame 1977 amendment: \u201cany other final action of the  \nAdministrator under this chapter \u2026 which is locally or  \nregionally applicable\u201d is reviewable only in \u201cthe appropri-\nate circuit\u201d court. Ibid.  \nIdentifying which circuit court is \u201cappropriate\u201d for  \nreviewing local or regional final action is usually easy. \nThat\u2019s because for these EPA actions, the relevant sub-\nstantive CAA provision makes it clear that the action  \naffects particular regulated facilities or States, each of \nwhich is governed by a regional circuit court. When EPA \npromulgates a regional action that happens to touch more \nthan one federal circuit\u2014for example, approving or re-\njecting an implementation plan for the Metropolitan Kan-\nsas City air-quality-control region\u2014there may be more \nthan one appropriate circuit. \nc. The courts of appeals and EPA agree that, to  \nassess the national vs. local applicability of an EPA action \nfor purposes of Section 7607(b)(1), courts look only \u201cto the \nface\u201d of the action as that action is authorized by the \nCAA\u2014not to the challenger\u2019s arguments in the petition \nfor review, and not to the effects of the action or the rea-\nsoning within it. American Rd. & Transp. Builders Ass\u2019n \nv. EPA, 705 F.3d 453, 456 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (Kavanaugh, \n\n \n8 \nJ.); see also, e.g., ATK Launch Sys., Inc. v. EPA, 651 F.3d \n1194, 1197 (10th Cir. 2011); U.S. Br. 20 (invoking \u201cthe face \nof \u201d the actions). That focus on what action EPA took fol-\nlows from the statutory instruction to look to the \u201cfinal ac-\ntion \u2026 under this chapter\u201d to resolve venue. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). \nThe textual structure of Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s first two \nsentences\u2014enumerated lists of CAA actions followed by \ncatchall phrases\u2014indicates that courts should apply the \ncatchall phrases by reasoning by analogy to the enumer-\nated provisions. The catchall phrases use a \u201ccollective \nterm\u201d\u2014any other final action\u2014\u201cat the end of a list of spe-\ncific items,\u201d so the collective term is \u201ccontrolled and  \ndefined by reference to the specific classes that precede \nit.\u201d Fischer v. United States, 603 U.S. 480, 487 (2024) \n(ejusdem generis canon) (cleaned up); see Kentucky, 123 \nF.4th at 460 (using ejusdem generis to interpret Section \n7607(b)(1)). Thus, an EPA final action pursuant to an  \nunenumerated CAA provision is \u201cnationally applicable\u201d if \nit applies to the whole nation like the enumerated actions \nin the first sentence of Section 7607(b)(1) do. And a final  \naction is \u201clocally or regionally applicable\u201d if it applies to \nless than the whole nation, as the enumerated CAA  \nactions in the second sentence do. Ibid. \nd. The third sentence contemplates a narrow excep-\ntion for certain rare EPA actions that, though locally or \nregionally applicable, are \u201cbased on a determination of  \nnationwide scope or effect.\u201d \u00a7 7607(b)(1). That sentence \nwas added by the same 1977 amendment referenced \nabove, prompted by a recommendation from the Adminis-\ntrative Conference of the United States that included a \nstatement from EPA General Counsel William Frick. See \n41 Fed. Reg. 56,767 (Dec. 30, 1976).  \nFrick had identified a circumstance where the third-\nsentence exception was needed. 41 Fed. Reg. at 56,768-\n\n \n9 \n56,769. Under a particular CAA provision at the time \n(since repealed), EPA could grant extensions of a State\u2019s \nattainment date for certain national ambient air quality \nstandards\u2014actions that were locally applicable\u2014only \u201cif \nafter review ... the Administrator determine[d] that,\u201d \namong other things, regulated emission sources were  \n\u201cunable to comply with the [applicable] requirements \u2026 \nbecause the necessary technology or other alternatives \nare not available or will not be available soon enough to \npermit compliance.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857c-5(e) (1973) (empha-\nsis added); see NRDC v. EPA, 475 F.2d 968 (D.C. Cir. \n1973) (explaining the available-technology determination \nand corresponding extension action). \nFrick\u2019s statement, which the government agrees (U.S. \nBr. 37) was the genesis of the third sentence in Sec-\ntion 7607(b)(1), illustrates how that exception works: If \nthe statutory text requires a particular EPA action to be \nbased on a statutory \u201cdetermination\u201d about a circum-\nstance equally affecting the whole nation, then a chal-\nlenge to that action should go to the D.C. Circuit. \nCongress provided that \u201cif \u201d a locally applicable action \u201cis \nbased on a determination of nationwide scope or effect and \nif in taking such action [EPA] finds and publishes that \nsuch action is based on such a determination,\u201d then the \nproper venue is the D.C. Circuit. \u00a7 7607(b)(1).  \nThe third sentence thus establishes two independent \nrequirements for this exception: the action must actually \nbe based on a determination of nationwide scope or effect, \nand EPA must publish a finding that it is so based. Accord \nU.S. Br. 30. Whether EPA publishes that finding is the \nonly part of Section 7607(b)(1) that contemplates any dis-\ncretion for the agency. The text is thus \u201cclear\u201d that \u201c[t]he \ncourt\u2014not EPA\u2014determines both the scope of an  \naction\u2019s applicability and whether it was based on a deter-\n\n \n10 \nmination of nationwide scope or effect.\u201d Texas v. EPA \n(\u201cTexas 2020\u201d), 983 F.3d 826, 833 (5th Cir. 2020); accord  \nSierra Club v. EPA, 47 F.4th 738, 746 (D.C. Cir. 2022). \ne. In sum, the CAA allocates venue for regulatory \nchallenges depending on the nature of the \u201cfinal action\u201d \nunder review: If EPA\u2019s \u201cfinal action \u2026 under this chap-\nter\u201d is \u201cnationally applicable,\u201d then the proper venue is \nthe D.C. Circuit. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). If EPA\u2019s \u201cfinal action \u2026  \nunder this chapter\u201d is \u201clocally or regionally applicable,\u201d \nthen the proper venue is presumptively a regional circuit \ncourt. Ibid.; see Texas v. EPA (\u201cTexas 2016\u201d), 829 F.3d \n405, 419, 424 (5th Cir. 2016). If EPA can demonstrate both \nthat a locally applicable action is \u201cbased on a determina-\ntion of nationwide scope or effect\u201d\u2014that is, a textually \ncalled for determination reaching all the nation\u2019s regu-\nlated parties equally\u2014\u201cand\u201d that EPA \u201cf [ound] and pub-\nlishe[d] that such action is based on such a determination,\u201d \nthen venue is proper in the D.C. Circuit. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). \nThe first question for venue, then, is: What is the \u201cfinal \naction \u2026 under this chapter\u201d that EPA was authorized to \ntake? To answer that question, courts \u201clook primarily to \nthe text of the statute,\u201d specifically to the relevant CAA \nprovision that is \u201cthe legal source of [EPA\u2019s] authority to \ntake the challenged action[ ].\u201d Texas v. EPA (\u201cTexas \n2023\u201d), No. 23-60069, 2023 WL 7204840, at *4 (5th Cir. \nMay 1, 2023); see Kentucky, 123 F.4th at 460-462; West \nVirginia v. EPA, 90 F.4th 323, 329 (4th Cir. 2024). \n2. Small-refinery hardship petitions under the \nAct\u2019s RFS Program \na. The CAA\u2019s RFS program requires that increasing \namounts of renewable fuels be blended into the transpor-\ntation fuel (gasoline and diesel) sold in the United States. \n\u00a7 7545(o)(2)(A)(i), (B)(i)(I)-(IV); see HollyFrontier Chey-\nenne Refin., LLC v. Renewable Fuels Ass\u2019n, 594 U.S. 382, \n\n \n11 \n385-387 (2021). EPA first sets annual renewable fuel per-\ncentage standards across the industry. \u00a7 7545(o)(3). Obli-\ngated parties\u2014refiners and importers of transportation \nfuel\u2014use those standards to learn their own annual vol-\nume obligations for each renewable-fuel category. See 40 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 80.1406. \nObligated parties comply with their annual RFS obli-\ngations by \u201cretiring\u201d credits called renewable identifica-\ntion numbers (\u201cRINs\u201d). 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 80.1427. A RIN is \ngenerated when renewable fuel (ethanol, for example) is \nmanufactured. Id. \u00a7 80.1426. The RIN remains attached \nto the volume of renewable fuel until it is blended into \ntransportation fuel, at which point the RIN is \u201csepa-\nrated.\u201d Id. \u00a7\u00a7 80.1428, 80.1429. RINs have a limited life; \nthey can be used for compliance only in the year they are \ngenerated or the next compliance year. \u00a7 7545(o)(5)(C). \nObligated parties demonstrate RFS compliance by secur-\ning sufficient separated RINs, either by generating RINs \nthrough blending renewable fuels or by purchasing RINs \nfrom others that blend. \u00a7 7545(o)(5)(B). \nb. \u201cThe RFS program reflects a carefully crafted leg-\nislative bargain to promote renewable fuels, but also to \nprovide an exemption mechanism for small refineries.\u201d \nSinclair Wyoming Refin. Co. LLC v. EPA, 114 F.4th 693, \n711 (D.C. Cir. 2024). A \u201csmall refinery\u201d has an average \naggregate daily crude oil throughput for a calendar year \nof 75,000 barrels or less. \u00a7 7545(o)(1)(K). Congress recog-\nnized that \u201cescalating [RFS] obligations could work spe-\ncial burdens on small refineries,\u201d many of which \u201clack the \ninherent scale advantages of large refineries\u201d and are lim-\nited in their ability to blend renewable fuels\u2014or are una-\nble to blend at all. HollyFrontier, 594 U.S. at 386 (cleaned \nup). Congress also understood that small refineries are \n\n \n12 \nessential to the nation\u2019s energy supply and often \u201ca major \nsource of jobs in rural communities.\u201d Id. at 386-387. \nEPA has acknowledged that \u201c[m]any\u201d small refineries \n\u201cdo not have access to renewable fuels or the ability to \nblend them, and so must use credits to comply\u201d with the \nRFS. 72 Fed. Reg. 23,900, 23,904 (May 1, 2007). Small  \nrefineries that cannot separate enough RINs through \nblending are forced to buy RINs on an unregulated sec-\nondary market where prices can fluctuate wildly. See 75 \nFed. Reg. 14,670, 14,722 (Mar. 26, 2010) (explaining RIN \nspot markets); HollyFrontier, 594 U.S. at 398 (noting one \nyear where RIN prices \u201cshot up by as much as 100%\u201d). \nCongress initially exempted all small refineries from \nthe RFS until 2011, and it directed the U.S. Department \nof Energy (\u201cDOE\u201d) to study whether RFS compliance \nwould impose disproportionate economic hardship on \nsmall refineries. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(A). DOE completed that \nstudy in 2011, finding that small refineries \u201chave particu-\nlar obstacles that would make compliance more costly \nthan those of large integrated companies.\u201d DOE, Small \nRefinery Exemption Study: An Investigation into Dispro-\nportionate Economic Hardship 3, 32, 37 (March 2011) \n(\u201c2011 DOE Study\u201d).3 DOE also recognized that small  \nrefineries\u2019 hardship would grow increasingly acute as  \nrenewable-fuel blending mandates increased. Id. at 17-18.  \nTo avoid damaging small refineries, Congress created \na permanent safety valve that allows a small refinery to \npetition EPA for an exemption from its annual RFS obli-\ngation \u201cfor the reason of disproportionate economic hard-\nship.\u201d \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(i). The Act provides that \u201c[a] small \nrefinery may at any time petition the Administrator\u201d for \n \n3  https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-12/docu-\nments/small-refinery-exempt-study.pdf. \n\n \n13 \nan exemption\u2014and thus requires each small refinery to \npetition separately for hardship relief. Ibid. (emphasis \nadded). Each granted petition frees only one small refin-\nery from its RFS obligation for the year(s) involved in the \npetition, based on that refinery\u2019s economic circumstances. \n\u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(i)-(ii); 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 80.1441(e)(2). EPA must \ndecide each small-refinery hardship petition in \u201cconsulta-\ntion\u201d with DOE after \u201cconsider[ing] the findings\u201d of DOE\u2019s \n2011 small-refinery study along with \u201cother economic fac-\ntors.\u201d \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(A)-(B). \nCongress required EPA to decide any hardship  \npetition submitted by a small refinery \u201cnot later than 90 \ndays after\u201d receipt, because a small refinery cannot plan \nadequately for RFS compliance until it knows whether it \nhas an obligation. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(iii). But EPA has failed \nto meet that deadline for almost 90 percent of hardship \npetitions submitted since 2013, causing significant uncer-\ntainty for small refineries. See U.S. Government Account-\nability Office, Renewable Fuel Standard: Actions Needed \nto Improve Decision-Making in the Small Refinery Ex-\nemption Program 20, GAO23104273 (Nov. 2022).4 \nc. When EPA has denied small-refinery hardship  \npetitions, the petitioners sometimes sought judicial review. \nRegarding venue for those challenges, EPA repeatedly \nacknowledged that RFS hardship-exemption decisions \nare \u201cquintessentially local action[s]\u201d that must be reviewed \nin the regional circuit courts. E.g., EPA Motion to Dismiss \n18, Advanced Biofuels Ass\u2019n v. EPA, No. 18-1115, Dkt. \n1740614 (D.C. Cir. July 13, 2018). \nOn the merits of those challenges, EPA suffered a \nstreak of losses where circuit courts vacated its hardship \ndecisions. See Sinclair Wyoming Refin. Co. v. EPA, 887 \n \n4  https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-23-104273. \n\n \n14 \nF.3d 986 (10th Cir. 2017); Ergon-West Virginia, Inc. v. \nEPA, 896 F.3d 600 (4th Cir. 2018); Renewable Fuels Ass\u2019n \nv. EPA, 948 F.3d 1206 (10th Cir. 2020); Ergon-West Vir-\nginia, Inc. v. EPA, 980 F.3d 403 (4th Cir. 2020). Frus-\ntrated by its repeated defeats in the regional circuits, and \nafter a 2021 change in presidential administration, EPA \nbegan attempting to eliminate small-refinery hardship  \nrelief altogether. EPA first abandoned defense of its own \nprior decisions granting hardship relief and began newly \ninsisting that a small refinery cannot receive relief unless \nit had received an exemption in every prior compliance \nyear. This Court rejected that new position in HollyFron-\ntier. 594 U.S. at 396-397. \nWhen that effort failed, EPA went back to the drawing \nboard intent on rejecting hardship relief and avoiding  \njudicial review anywhere other than the D.C. Circuit. \nB. The present controversy \n1. The small-refinery respondents here have repeat-\nedly received RFS hardship relief from EPA in the past, \nbecause each of them faces structural disadvantages that \nmake RFS compliance disproportionately burdensome. \nThe respondents petitioned EPA again for hardship relief \nfor some or all of the compliance years 2017 through 2021. \nPet.App.19a nn.26-27. EPA initially granted Wynne-\nwood\u2019s hardship petition for 2017, and it granted Calumet \nShreveport\u2019s, Ergon Refining\u2019s, Placid\u2019s, and Wynne-\nwood\u2019s petitions for 2018. See EPA, Decision on 2018 \nSmall Refinery Exemption Petitions (Aug. 9, 2019).5 \nIn December 2021, however, EPA reversed itself and \nissued a proposal to deny every pending small-refinery \nhardship petition, including by retroactively denying pre-\n \n5 https://www.regulations.gov/comment/EPA-HQ-OAR-2021-\n0566-0077#collapseAttachmentMetadata-ember186 (Tab I). \n\n \n15 \nviously granted petitions. 86 Fed. Reg. 70,999 (Dec. 14, \n2021). EPA proposed to do so by applying multiple sea-\nchanges to the agency\u2019s longstanding approach to hard-\nship petitions. See Proposed Denials.6 EPA also proposed, \nhowever, to continue its existing practice of deciding hard-\nship petitions through agency adjudication, because ap-\nplying a new rulemaking process to hardship petitions \nfrom prior years would have been unlawfully retroactive. \nSee Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hosp., 488 U.S. 204, 208-\n209 (1988). \nEPA\u2019s proposed denials included a new statutory in-\nterpretation and a new \u201ceconomic theory\u201d hypothesizing \nthat \u201cthe RFS program cannot cause [disproportionate \neconomic hardship]\u201d because RIN costs are supposedly \nthe same for all obligated parties regardless of their size, \nbargaining power, location, or blending capability, and  \nbecause obligated parties supposedly universally pass \nthrough 100% of their RIN costs in the price of the fuel \nthey sell. Proposed Denials 11-12 & n.37. Small refineries \ncommented on the proposal, explaining why EPA\u2019s new \nstatutory position was textually unsupportable and why \ntheir individual economic evidence refuted EPA\u2019s hypoth-\nesis that small refineries universally pass on RIN costs. \nE.g., JA 131-275. \nIn April 2022, in the first set of administrative actions \nchallenged here, EPA followed through on its proposal \nand simultaneously denied 36 previously decided hard-\nship petitions (31 of which EPA had previously granted), \nincluding petitions submitted by these respondents. \nPet.App.189a-330a (the \u201cApril Denials\u201d). EPA announced \nit was satisfied that each of the petitioning small refineries \n \n6  EPA, Proposed RFS Small Refinery Exemption Decision \n(Dec. \n2021), \nhttps://www.epa.gov/renewable-fuel-standard-\nprogram/proposal-deny-petitions-small-refinery-exemptions. \n\n \n16 \nwas able to fully pass through its RIN costs in the price of \nits fuel. Id. at 209a-212a. EPA issued each small refinery \na \u201cconfidential, refinery-specific appendi[x]\u201d to the April \nDenials\u2019 explanation document, giving individualized rea-\nsons for its conclusion that each refinery could pass \nthrough 100% of its RFS costs. Id. at 199a. \nIn June 2022, EPA largely copied and pasted its April \nreasoning to announce the denial of another 69 hardship \npetitions, including these small-refinery respondents\u2019  \npetitions for some or all of the 2017 and 2019-2021 years. \nPet.App.44a-188a (the \u201cJune Denials\u201d). The June Denials\u2019 \nexplanation document stated \u201cthat none of the 69 pending \n[small-refinery hardship] petitions for the 2016-2021 com-\npliance years ha[s] demonstrated [disproportionate eco-\nnomic hardship] caused by the cost of compliance with the \nrequirements of the RFS program.\u201d Pet.App.185a. EPA \nagain provided separate \u201cconfidential, refinery-specific \nappendices\u201d explaining its findings on each small refin-\nery\u2019s RIN-cost passthrough. Pet.App.55a. \nThe refinery-specific appendices accompanying the \nApril and June Denials detailed EPA\u2019s individualized  \nassessments of each small refinery\u2019s economic condition. \nFor example, EPA considered whether one respondent \nrefinery could blend enough biodiesel given that it oper-\nates in a market that does not accept biodiesel blends, and \nwhether that refinery faced higher ethanol costs than \nother large refiners and blenders in its area. JA 285-287. \nEPA considered whether another respondent faced \nhigher transportation costs for shipping from terminals \nalong the Gulf Coast. JA 293-295. And EPA considered \nthe price impacts to another respondent from the fact \nthat, in its tri-State region, the small refinery faced dimin-\nished demand for kerosene-based jet fuel and more- \nstringent specifications for ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel. JA \n\n \n17 \n312-313. It was based on individualized, refinery-specific  \nconsiderations like those\u2014how each refinery fits in its \nown local market\u2014that EPA concluded that each of the \npetitioning small refineries \u201cis recovering its [RFS com-\npliance] costs,\u201d and for that reason is not experiencing dis-\nproportionate economic hardship. E.g., JA 280, 286, 298. \nEPA accomplished its bundled denial decisions only \nby ignoring the statutory deadline to decide the hardship \npetitions; it held dozens beyond the 90-day deadline so \nthat it could deny them together and create the appear-\nance of promulgating just two actions. \n2. The small-refinery respondents filed petitions for \njudicial review of EPA\u2019s denials of their RFS hardship  \npetitions. Because the refineries each are headquartered, \nincorporated, or operate within the Fifth Circuit, they \nsought review there. Two groups representing the inter-\nests of the biofuel industry\u2014the respondents in support \nof petitioner here (\u201cBiofuel respondents\u201d)\u2014intervened to \nsupport EPA\u2019s denials of hardship relief. \nEPA moved to dismiss the petitions or transfer them \nto the D.C. Circuit, asserting that because it had bundled \ntogether its hardship-petition denial decisions, they were \n\u201cnationally applicable\u201d or else \u201cbased on a determination \nof nationwide scope or effect.\u201d \u00a7 7607(b)(1). \nThe Fifth Circuit denied EPA\u2019s motions. Pet.App.9a-\n15a. EPA\u2019s actions denying the small refineries\u2019 hardship \npetitions were \u201clocally \u2026 applicable,\u201d not \u201cnationally  \napplicable,\u201d because they affected only the individual  \npetitioning small refineries. Id. at 11a-12a. Nor were \nEPA\u2019s actions based on any nationwide determination. Id. \nat 12a-13a. EPA conceded that it had \u201cconsidered each  \npetition on the merits and individual refinery infor-\nmation.\u201d Id. at 14a (cleaned up). And EPA\u2019s explanation \ndocuments confirm that the agency\u2019s final actions\u2014its  \n\n \n18 \nultimate denials of the hardship-exemption petitions\u2014\n\u201cre[lied] on refinery-specific determinations\u201d about each \nrefinery\u2019s own \u201ceconomic hardship\u201d factors. Id. at 15a. \nOn the merits of the small refineries\u2019 challenges, the \nFifth Circuit explained at length why EPA\u2019s hardship- \ndenial actions were \u201c(1) impermissibly retroactive; \n(2) contrary to law; and (3) counter to the record evi-\ndence.\u201d Pet.App.3a; see id. at 16a-33a. \nThe Biofuel respondents filed petitions for rehearing \nand rehearing en banc. Those were denied. Pet.App.332a-\n333a. \n3. Some other small refineries whose RFS hardship \npetitions were denied as part of EPA\u2019s April and June  \nDenials chose to petition for judicial review only in the \nD.C. Circuit. And still other small refineries filed petitions \nfor review in the regional circuits but had their petitions \ntransferred to the D.C. Circuit\u2014most without a substan-\ntive explanation or opinion. See U.S. Br. 13 & nn.2-3. \nIn July 2024, the D.C. Circuit unanimously agreed \nwith the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \u201canalysis and conclusion\u201d on the \nmerits that EPA\u2019s April and June Denials were \u201ccontrary \nto law\u201d and must be vacated. Sinclair Wyoming, 114 \nF.4th at 706-707 & n.5. The D.C. Circuit also held that the \ndenials were arbitrary and capricious because \u201creality  \nundercuts EPA\u2019s\u201d economic \u201ctheory\u201d that small refineries \ncan universally pass on their RIN costs. Id. at 713. \n \n\n \n19 \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nA. The Fifth Circuit correctly held that EPA\u2019s final \nactions challenged here were locally applicable rather \nthan nationally applicable, and were based on respond-\nents\u2019 local economic circumstances rather than any deter-\nmination of nationwide scope or effect.  \n1. Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s reference to the agency\u2019s \u201cfinal \naction \u2026 under this chapter\u201d indicates that it is the sub-\nstantive CAA text that determines what final actions the \nagency was authorized to take. Whether and how EPA \nchooses to bundle its final actions is irrelevant to venue. \nHere, every part of the relevant provision under the \n\u201cchapter\u201d\u2014especially the singular, definite articles and \nthe deadline for deciding hardship petitions indexed to \neach petition\u2019s submission date\u2014indicates that Congress \ndirected EPA to produce individualized final actions on  \nindividually submitted hardship petitions. \n2. EPA\u2019s individual denials of hardship relief were \nobviously locally appliable rather than nationally applica-\nble. The government does not argue otherwise. Those  \ndecisions on individually submitted petitions affecting \nonly one refinery look nothing like the enumerated nation-\nwide actions in Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s first sentence, but they \nclosely resemble the enumerated locally applicable ac-\ntions in the second sentence. \n3. \u201cDetermination\u201d is a term of art in the CAA. An \nEPA action is based on a determination of nationwide \nscope or effect in the rare instance where the CAA\u2019s text \ndirects EPA to make a \u201cdetermination\u201d about the entire \nnation or industry, without the need to consider individual \ncircumstances. But here, the CAA required EPA to base \nits hardship decisions on each petitioning small refinery\u2019s \nindividual economic hardship factors. And EPA\u2019s own doc-\numents confirm that the agency did just that. \n\n \n20 \nB. The government\u2019s arguments seeking D.C. Circuit \nreview fail. \n1. The government goes astray because it gets the \nrelevant \u201caction\u201d wrong. EPA contends that its denials of \n105 individually submitted hardship petitions were really \njust two actions, asserting that a court may not contest \nEPA\u2019s \u201ccharacterization\u201d of its actions. But it is the text \nof \u201cth[e] chapter,\u201d not EPA, that determines what final \nactions the agency is authorized to take.  \n2. EPA\u2019s argument for national applicability depends \non the Court accepting the agency\u2019s view of the relevant \nunit of administrative action. Even if EPA were correct \nthat the bundled decision announcements were the rele-\nvant actions, those still were not nationally applicable  \nbecause they applied only to those refineries that chose to \npetition for hardship relief, not to the whole nation. EPA \nasserts that any agency action that touches more than one \njudicial circuit is nationally applicable. But that argument \nproduces the absurd result that an expressly regional  \naction for a metropolitan region that happens to encom-\npass two States (and two circuits) would be \u201cnationally ap-\nplicable\u201d and reviewable only by the D.C. Circuit. \n3. Contrary to EPA\u2019s assertion, the hardship denial \nactions were not based on any determination of nation-\nwide scope or effect. \nThe relevant text of the \u201cchapter\u201d here, unlike other \nclosely related provisions, does not call for any \u201cdetermi-\nnation\u201d on a small-refinery hardship petition. EPA\u2019s argu-\nment depends on treating \u201cdetermination\u201d not as a term \nof art but as an amorphous concept of anything that con-\ntributed significantly to an EPA action. \nIn any event, neither EPA\u2019s new interpretation of the \nAct, nor its new RIN-cost-passthrough economic hypoth-\nesis, were \u201cnationwide determinations\u201d that formed the \n\n \n21 \n\u201cbas[is]\u201d for EPA\u2019s hardship denial decisions. Every EPA \naction necessarily rests to some degree on the agency\u2019s \nunderstanding of its statutory authority. And EPA is  \nrequired to apply a \u201cuniform\u201d statutory interpretation to \nsimilarly situated small-refinery petitioners\u2014anything \nelse would have been arbitrary. Moreover, EPA\u2019s new \nstatutory reading could not be the basis for final actions \non respondents\u2019 hardship petitions; EPA expressly did \nnot use a rulemaking here. EPA achieved final actions \nonly by applying its statutory interpretation to respond-\nents\u2019 individual economic facts. \nFor the same reason, even if EPA\u2019s economic theory \ncould qualify as a \u201cdetermination\u201d under the CAA, the  \nfinal actions denying respondents\u2019 hardship petitions \nwere not \u201cbased on\u201d it. Moving beyond hypothesis to final \nactions required EPA to test its prediction against re-\nspondents\u2019 economic evidence. And EPA acknowledges on \nthe face of the denial decisions that it did so. \nEPA\u2019s decisions here do not resemble the unusual \nCAA provision that was the genesis for the nationwide-\ndetermination exception sentence in Section 7607(b)(1).  \nEPA\u2019s appeals to policy cannot overcome the statutory \ntext. And in any event, EPA\u2019s attempt to force dozens of \nsmall refineries to litigate their RFS hardship-denial  \ndecisions together in the D.C. Circuit has served only to  \nobscure judicial consideration of the individual economic \nfactors that the CAA makes the core basis for hardship \nrelief. \n \n \n\n \n22 \nARGUMENT \nSection 7607(b)(1) sets the venue for a petition for  \nreview principally by asking whether the EPA \u201cfinal  \naction\u201d being challenged is nationally applicable or  \nlocally/regionally applicable. Courts identify the relevant \n\u201cfinal action\u201d by examining the substantive text of \u201cth[e] \nchapter\u201d\u2014the CAA. Here the chapter designates the final \nactions as EPA\u2019s denials of small refineries\u2019 individually \nsubmitted RFS hardship petitions. The statutory text \ncalls for individualized consideration of each petitioning \nsmall refinery\u2019s \u201cdisproportionate economic hardship.\u201d \n\u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B). \nOnce EPA\u2019s individual denial decisions are properly \nidentified as the \u201cfinal action[s]\u201d under challenge, their \nnational vs. local applicability is obvious: Those individual \ndenials are, as EPA has always said, \u201cquintessentially  \nlocal action[s]\u201d for Section 7607(b)(1) because they \u201cadju-\ndicate[ ] legal rights as to a single refinery in a single loca-\ntion.\u201d EPA Motion 18, Advanced Biofuels, No. 18-1115, \nsupra. The face of the actions here confirms that EPA \nreached final decisions only by examining refinery-specific \nevidence and reaching refinery-specific conclusions that \nnone of these respondents experiences disproportionate \neconomic hardship from the RFS. Indeed, the statutory \ntext compelled EPA to deny hardship relief based on the \npetitioning small refineries\u2019 own economic circum-\nstances\u2014not any nationwide determination. So the Fifth \nCircuit correctly held that it was the proper venue rather \nthan the D.C. Circuit. \nThe government contends (U.S. Br. 28-29) that these \nhardship-petition denial actions are nationally applica-\nble\u2014unlike all prior hardship decisions\u2014because EPA \nhas \u201ccharacteriz[ed]\u201d them differently. EPA conceives of \nits decisions denying 105 separately submitted hardship \n\n \n23 \npetitions as just two national actions because it chose to \nannounce those denials together. But EPA does not  \ndecide what the relevant \u201cfinal action\u201d is under the CAA\u2014\nthe statute does. The substantive CAA provision at issue \ndesignates each individual hardship decision as the rele-\nvant unit of administrative action, none of which applies in \nmore than one circuit. EPA\u2019s suggestions that any action \nhappening to touch more than one circuit is \u201cnationally  \napplicable,\u201d and that it can manufacture nationally appli-\ncable actions by bundling individual decisions together, \nare inconsistent with the CAA\u2019s text, context, and history, \nas well as common sense. \nAlternatively, EPA claims that these hardship deci-\nsions are locally applicable but based on a new statutory \ninterpretation and economic theory that have nationwide \nscope or effect. Wrong, both times. EPA\u2019s musings about \nits statutory instructions, and its generalized economic \nhypothesis about small refineries\u2019 RIN costs, were merely \nsteps along the way of EPA\u2019s individual-refinery deci-\nsionmaking process. Neither was a \u201cdetermination\u201d\u2014 \na term of art in the CAA\u2014called for by the text. And nei-\nther produced any final agency action. EPA\u2019s final actions \nwere instead expressly based on its conclusions about \neach petitioning small refinery\u2019s economic circumstances. \nEPA itself says it denied respondents\u2019 hardship petitions \nbased on its (erroneous) view that each refinery \u201cis recov-\nering its [RFS compliance] costs.\u201d E.g., JA 280, 286, 298 \n(emphasis added). \nUnder the venue instructions in Section 7607(b)(1),  \nreview of these hardship-petition actions belongs in the \nregional circuit courts\u2014exactly where prior actions on \nsimilar petitions have long been reviewed. The Fifth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s judgment should be affirmed. \n\n \n24 \nA. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision was correct. \nIdentifying the proper venue for judicial review under \nSection 7607(b)(1) involves three questions: (1) What  \n\u201cfinal action\u201d did EPA take \u201cunder\u201d the CAA? (2) Was \nthat final action locally or regionally applicable, as opposed \nto nationally applicable? (3) If so, was the action neverthe-\nless \u201cbased on a determination of nationwide scope or  \neffect\u201d? The Fifth Circuit answered each of those ques-\ntions correctly. \n1. The \u201cfinal action[s]\u201d are EPA\u2019s denials of each \nsmall-refinery\u2019s hardship petition. \na. The parties and the courts of appeals agree that \n\u201cSection 7607(b)(1) categorizes petitions for [judicial]  \nreview according to the nature of the [EPA] action\u201d being \nchallenged. Texas 2016, 829 F.3d at 419; accord U.S. Br. \n20 (citing additional cases). But a court cannot assess an  \naction\u2019s nature until it identifies \u201cwhat \u2018final action\u2019 [it is] \ndealing with.\u201d Kentucky v. EPA, Nos. 23-3216/23-3225, \n2023 WL 11871967, at *2 (6th Cir. July 25, 2023).  \nThe statute helpfully describes how to answer that \nquestion: refer to the \u201cfinal action of [EPA] under this \nchapter.\u201d \u00a7 7607(b)(1) (emphasis added). \u201c[T]his chapter\u201d \nis the CAA. See p. 6, supra. Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s phrase  \n\u201cfinal action \u2026 under this chapter\u201d points the reader to \nthe substantive CAA provision that provides \u201cthe legal \nsource of the agency\u2019s \u2026 authority to take the challenged \nactions.\u201d Texas 2023, 2023 WL 7204840, at *4; see p. 10, \nsupra (additional cases making the same point). \nSection 7607(b)(1)\u2019s overall structure makes this even \nmore clear. By enumerating specific CAA sections author-\nizing national or local/regional actions in the first two sen-\ntences, and then adding a catchall clause to each sentence \nfor \u201cany other\u201d nationally or locally/regionally applicable \naction, the venue provision repeatedly requires cross ref-\n\n \n25 \nerencing the CAA provision that authorized the EPA  \naction under challenge. See Kentucky, 123 F.4th at 461 \n(Section 7607(b)(1) \u201cfocuses on the statute \u2026 to distin-\nguish\u201d national vs. local/regional actions). \nb. The \u201cfinal action\u201d that the CAA authorized here is \nfor EPA to \u201cact on\u201d a small refinery\u2019s individually submit-\nted RFS hardship petition. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B); see Pet.App. \n185a (EPA invoking \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B) as its source of author-\nity). So that is the \u201crelevant unit of administrative action\u201d \nfor venue purposes. Texas 2023, 2023 WL 7204840, at *4.  \nEverything about that substantive text demonstrates \nthat EPA\u2019s final actions on hardship petitions are to be \nindividualized. Every reference in that subsection to the \n\u201cpetition\u201d or the petitioning \u201crefinery\u201d is in the singular: \n\u201cA small refinery may at any time petition\u201d EPA for a \nhardship exemption, based on the \u201creason of dispropor-\ntionate economic hardship\u201d if required to comply with the \nRFS. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(i) (emphasis added). EPA must \n\u201cevaluat[e] a petition,\u201d considering the findings of the \n2011 DOE small-refinery study and other economic fac-\ntors. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(ii) (emphasis added). Whether a par-\nticular petitioning small refinery is experiencing dis-\nproportionate economic hardship from the RFS in a given \nyear is necessarily an individualized inquiry focused on \nthat refinery\u2019s own economic circumstances.  \nCongress also provided that the statutory deadline for \nEPA to \u201cact on any [small-refinery hardship] petition\u201d is \nindexed to each petition: \u201cnot later than 90 days after the \ndate of receipt of the petition.\u201d \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(iii). That \nprovision forcefully confirms that Congress directed EPA \nto produce individualized actions on hardship petitions; \nthe rolling, refinery-specific deadlines would make no \nsense otherwise. Cf. Kentucky, 123 F.4th at 461 (EPA\u2019s \nobligation \u201cto \u2018act\u2019 on each State\u2019s \u2018submission\u2019 on a plan-\n\n \n26 \nby-plan basis within a specified time\u201d indicates those  \nactions are locally rather than nationally applicable) (cita-\ntion omitted). And as mentioned above (p. 17, supra), EPA \nwas able to produce bundled hardship decisions only by \ndeliberately ignoring the CAA\u2019s decision deadline. \nThe broader statutory context also shows that Con-\ngress did not intend its \u201csingular\u201d definite and indefinite \narticles in this subsection to \u201cinclude and apply to several \npersons, parties, or things.\u201d Contra U.S. Br. 26 (quoting \n1 U.S.C. \u00a7 1). Congress initially granted a blanket exemp-\ntion from the RFS through 2011 to all \u201csmall refineries\u201d\u2014\nplural. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(A)(i). Congress then directed EPA to \nextend that exemption for another two years on an indi-\nvidualized basis to only \u201ca\u201d small refinery that DOE  \ndetermined would face disproportionate economic hard-\nship from the RFS. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(A)(ii)(II). After that, Con-\ngress transitioned to the current petition-based approach. \n\u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B). The statute now puts the onus on each \nsmall refinery to request hardship relief based on its own \n\u201cdisproportionate economic hardship.\u201d \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(i). \nCongress knew how to authorize blanket or multiple  \nexemption actions, but it did not do so here. Congress  \ninstead directed EPA to \u201cact on\u201d \u201cthe petition\u201d \u201csubmit-\nted by a small refinery.\u201d \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(iii) (emphases \nadded). \nc. Federal courts\u2019 practice also reflects the reality \nthat EPA\u2019s individual hardship-exemption decisions are \nthe final actions for venue purposes. When the Fifth Cir-\ncuit below held that EPA\u2019s denial decisions were unlawful, \nit did not vacate all 105 EPA denial decisions, despite the \ngovernment\u2019s urging that it had produced just two na-\ntional actions. Instead, the Fifth Circuit properly vacated \nonly the denial decisions for the small refineries before it. \nPet.App.34a. \n\n \n27 \nIn another recent case involving subsequent small- \nrefinery hardship decisions that EPA bundled together, \nthe government moved the D.C. Circuit to act separately \non the denial decisions for particular refineries\u2014to vacate \nsome final actions in EPA\u2019s bundle but not others. See \nCalumet Montana Refin., LLC v. EPA, No. 23-1194, Dkt. \n2081226 (Oct. 21, 2024); see id., Dkt. 2091139 (Dec. 23, \n2024) (D.C. Circuit granting limited vacatur in accord with \nEPA\u2019s request). That motion confirms EPA\u2019s agreement \nthat, even when it bundles small-refinery hardship deci-\nsions together, courts review the individual final actions \nthat apply to each refinery. And EPA would surely take \nthe position that each denied refinery must file a petition \nfor review to obtain judicial review at all. \n* \nThe relevant \u201cfinal action[s]\u201d for venue purposes are \nthus EPA\u2019s decisions on each small refinery\u2019s hardship \npetition, regardless of EPA\u2019s choice to bundle its petition  \ndecisions. Accord Kentucky, 123 F.4th at 460-463 (reject-\ning EPA\u2019s argument that its consolidated disapprovals of \n21 state implementation plans constituted a single action). \nOnce the action is properly identified, it \u201cmakes this case \neasy.\u201d Id. at 461. EPA\u2019s individual denial decisions are  \nobviously locally/regionally applicable\u2014the government \ndoesn\u2019t try to argue otherwise. And those decisions did \nnot involve any nationwide \u201cdetermination\u201d called for by \nthe CAA. Rather, each was based (as they must be per the \nAct) on EPA\u2019s refinery-specific evaluations of each peti-\ntioning small refinery\u2019s own economic hardship factors\u2014\nthings like local-market acceptance of renewable fuel, \npercentage of diesel production, access to capital, etc. See, \ne.g., JA 280, 285-287, 293-298. \n\n \n28 \n2. EPA\u2019s denials of the hardship petitions are \u201clocally \nor regionally applicable\u201d actions. \na. The venue provision\u2019s \u201capplicability\u201d inquiry\u2014 \nnationally vs. locally/regionally applicable\u2014asks about \n\u201cthe location of the persons or enterprises that the action \nregulates.\u201d Texas v. EPA, No. 10-60961, 2011 WL 710598, \nat *3 (5th Cir. Feb. 24, 2011) (quoting New York v. EPA, \n133 F.3d 987, 990 (7th Cir. 1998)). Multiple courts of  \nappeals have agreed, at the government\u2019s urging, that \nwhat matters is \u201cthe face of \u201d the action, American Road, \n705 F.3d at 456 (Kavanaugh, J.), not the action\u2019s reasoning \nor practical \u201ceffects,\u201d ATK Launch, 651 F.3d at 1197.  \nAccord U.S. Br. 20-21 (citing additional cases).7 \nThe \u201c \u2018ordinary meaning\u2019 \u201d of the \u201ckey words\u201d in Sec-\ntion 7607(b)(1)\u2019s first sentence\u2014\u201c \u2018nationally applicable \nregulations promulgated, or final action taken\u2019 by the \nEPA\u201d\u2014\u201cconvey[s] that the challenged regulations or  \naction must apply to the entire country.\u201d Kentucky, 123 \nF.4th at 459 (emphasis added; citations omitted). The \nSixth Circuit\u2019s Kentucky opinion gives the relevant dic-\ntionary definitions, see ibid., though it\u2019s \u201cdoubt[ful] that \nwe need dictionaries for this point,\u201d ibid. The word \u201cna-\ntionally\u201d refers to an EPA action affecting the \u201cnation as \na whole.\u201d Ibid. (citation omitted). \nTwo different canons of construction confirm that  \ninterpretation. The first is ejusdem generis. See Ken-\ntucky, 123 F.4th at 460. Because the phrase \u201cnationally \napplicable\u201d comes in a catchall clause following an enu-\nmerated list of national CAA actions, courts determine \n \n7  Biofuel respondents\u2019 alternative theory (Br. 21)\u2014that the \nkey to venue is what arguments might be raised in a petition \nfor review challenging the agency action\u2014has been repeatedly \nrejected. It is contrary to the textual instruction to look to the \n\u201cfinal action \u2026 under this chapter.\u201d \u00a7 7607(b)(1). \n\n \n29 \nthe meaning of \u201cnationally applicable\u201d by reference to the \nenumerated actions. Ibid. (citing Bissonnette v. LePage \nBakeries Park St., LLC, 601 U.S. 246, 252 (2024)). And the \nfirst sentence\u2019s enumerated CAA actions all \u201chave nation-\nwide applicability,\u201d ibid.: They regulate across the whole \nnation without individualized consideration, and they  \napply irrespective of whether any party requested agency \naction or not. By contrast, the enumerated locally applica-\nble actions in Section 7607(b)(1) involve individual regu-\nlated entities or States. Finding a \u201cnationally applicable\u201d \naction for purposes of the catchall clause thus requires \nidentifying an EPA final action that similarly affects the \nentire nation, irrespective of a party\u2019s local circumstances. \nSecond, \u201ccourts presume that Congress means to \nadopt \u2018clear boundaries\u2019 in \u2018jurisdictional statutes\u2019 to avoid \nwasteful litigation over the proper forum.\u201d Kentucky, 123 \nF.4th at 460 (quoting Direct Mktg. Ass\u2019n v. Brohl, 575 \nU.S. 1, 11 (2015), and citing other cases). The courts of  \nappeals have agreed that Section 7607(b)(1) is a venue \nprovision rather than a jurisdictional one.8 But the basic \npoint is the same: No one\u2019s interests are served by com-\nplex disputes over venue. Clear boundaries are set by giv-\ning \u201cnationally applicable\u201d its ordinary meaning: An EPA \nfinal action is \u201cnationally applicable\u201d for purposes of  \nSection 7607(b)(1) when it governs the entire nation, as  \nopposed to when it governs some lesser subset of regu-\nlated parties, States, or regions. \nb. In the context of the RFS program, the CAA  \nauthorizes EPA to take some national actions and some \nlocal actions. For example: When EPA publishes annual \n \n8  See Texas 2016, 829 F.3d at 418; Dalton Trucking, Inc. v. \nEPA, 808 F.3d 875, 879 (D.C. Cir. 2015); Clean Water Action \nCouncil of Ne. Wis., Inc. v. EPA, 765 F.3d 749, 751 (7th Cir. \n2014). \n\n \n30 \nrenewable-fuel blending-volume obligations for the indus-\ntry, that is a nationally applicable action, and any chal-\nlenge to it goes to the D.C. Circuit. See, e.g., Americans \nfor Clean Energy v. EPA, 864 F.3d 691 (D.C. Cir. 2017). \nThat\u2019s because EPA\u2019s volumes rule affects every RFS-\nobligated party in the nation.  \nBut when EPA decides a small refinery\u2019s RFS hard-\nship petition, that is a \u201cquintessentially local action,\u201d as \nEPA itself has previously (correctly) put it. EPA Motion \n18, Advanced Biofuels, No. 18-1115, supra. Hardship  \ndecisions look nothing like the national actions enumer-\nated in Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s first sentence, but they closely \nresemble the individualized decisions enumerated in the \nsecond sentence. Hardship decisions do not regulate the \nwhole nation or industry; they \u201cinvolve only the regulation \nof \u201d individual facilities\u2019 requests for relief and \u201chave legal \nconsequences only for [those] facilities.\u201d Texas 2023, 2023 \nWL 7204840, at *5; see West Virginia Chamber of Com-\nmerce v. Browner, 166 F.3d 336 (4th Cir. 1998) (finding it \n\u201cclearly regionally applicable\u201d \u201cwhen the EPA \u2026 makes \na determination with respect to a particular facility\u201d). \nAs EPA has previously explained: Each of the small-\nrefinery respondents\u2019 hardship petitions \u201conly requested \nrelief for one refinery.\u201d EPA Reply in Support of Motion \nto Dismiss 2, Lion Oil Co. v. EPA, No. 14-3405, Dkt. \n4227218 (8th Cir. Dec. 17, 2014). And each denial action \nwas a \u201cdecision with respect to a particular small refin-\nery\u2019s request\u201d that \u201cadjudicates legal rights as to that sin-\ngle refinery in its single location.\u201d U.S. Br. 15, Producers \nof Renewables United for Integrity Truth and Transpar-\nency v. EPA (\u201cPRUITT\u201d), No. 18-1202, Dkt. 1775897 \n(D.C. Cir. Mar. 4, 2019). \nThat is why EPA has repeatedly argued that RFS \nhardship decisions are locally applicable for Section \n\n \n31 \n7607(b)(1), before EPA began attempting to manufacture \nvenue in the D.C. Circuit by bundling decisions together. \nE.g., PRUITT, No. 18-1202, supra; EPA Response 2,  \nRenewable Fuels Ass\u2019n v. EPA, No. 18-9533, Dkt. 35 (10th \nCir. July 12, 2018) (\u201cvenue is proper in this Court\u201d); U.S. \nBr. 2-3, Ergon-West Virginia, Inc. v. EPA, Nos. 19-2128, \n19-2148, 19-2152 (consol.), Dkt. 64 (4th Cir. May 28, 2020) \n(challenge to denied hardship petition \u201cproperly venued\u201d \nin Fourth Circuit \u201cbecause the action is locally or region-\nally applicable\u201d). \n3. EPA\u2019s actions were based on local economic facts, \nnot any nationwide statutory determination. \na. Because EPA\u2019s denials of respondents\u2019 RFS hard-\nship petitions are \u201clocally or regionally applicable ac-\ntion[s],\u201d the text of Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s third sentence \npresumptively \u201crequires review in th[e] [regional] cir-\ncuit.\u201d Texas 2016, 829 F.3d at 424; see Kentucky, 2023 WL \n11871967, at *3. EPA can overcome that presumption only \nby demonstrating that its denials were \u201cbased on a deter-\nmination of nationwide scope or effect.\u201d \u00a7 7607(b)(1); see \npp. 8-10, supra. \nThe courts of appeals broadly agree that the scope and \neffect of EPA\u2019s determinations are reviewed \u201cde novo\u201d \nand without deference to the agency. Texas 2016, 829 F.3d \nat 421 (5th Cir.); see Sierra Club, 47 F.4th at 746 (D.C. \nCir.); Dalton Trucking, Inc. v. EPA, 808 F.3d 875, 881 \n(D.C. Cir. 2015). The third-sentence exception applies \nonly \u201cif [the] action is based on a determination of nation-\nwide scope or effect and if in taking such action the Ad-\nministrator finds and publishes that such action is based \non such a determination.\u201d \u00a7 7607(b)(1) (emphases added). \nIt does not suffice for EPA to find and publish a nation-\nwide-effect conclusion; the action must actually be based \non a determination of nationwide scope or effect and EPA \n\n \n32 \nmust publish that finding. The first of those independent \n\u201ctwo conditions\u201d (unlike the second) makes no reference \nto what EPA finds or publishes, so it is a legal question for \nthe courts. Texas 2016, 829 F.3d at 421; see Sierra Club, \n47 F.4th at 746; see also Loper Bright Enterprises v. Rai-\nmondo, 603 U.S. 369 (2024). \nBoth the text and history of Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s third \nsentence show that, to trigger the exception, the relevant \nsubstantive CAA provision must textually direct EPA to \nmake a \u201cdetermination\u201d for the entire nation\u2014i.e., the \nkind of determination that does not depend on individual \ncircumstances. See pp. 8-9, supra. That was the kind of \nstatutory determination identified by EPA General Coun-\nsel Frick that the government agrees (U.S. Br. 18) \nprompted Congress to add the third sentence to Section \n7607(b)(1). And the government further agrees (U.S. Br. \n31) that Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s \u201cbased on\u201d formulation means \nthe relevant EPA determination cannot be \u201cperipheral or \nextraneous\u201d but must \u201clie at the core of the agency  \naction.\u201d Texas 2016, 829 F.3d at 419. \nThe CAA is littered with provisions requiring \u201cdeter-\nminations\u201d as the basis for final actions. In fact, more than \nhalf of the CAA\u2019s sections call for at least one determina-\ntion before EPA can act. See generally 42 U.S.C. Ch. 85. \nCongress\u2019s repeated use of the term \u201cdetermination\u201d or \nits derivatives throughout the Act indicates it is a term of \nart with the same meaning in Section 7607(b)(1). See  \nMohamad v. Palestinian Auth., 566 U.S. 449, 456 (2012). \nSo courts do not apply Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s third sentence \nby asking generally about the inputs or processes for an \nEPA action; they look to whether the statutory text called \nfor taking that action on the basis of a specific kind of  \ndetermination. See Kentucky, 123 F.4th at 463-464 (\u201cWhen \nused to describe a ruling from an \u2018administrative agency,\u2019 \n\n \n33 \n\u2018determination\u2019 has a more precise \u2018legal meaning\u2019 \u201d that \ndoes \u201cnot\u201d refer to \u201ceach preliminary step on the road to \n[the agency\u2019s] decision.\u201d) (citation omitted). \nb. EPA\u2019s denials of the small-refinery respondents\u2019 \nhardship petitions were not based on any statutory deter-\nminations of nationwide scope or effect.  \ni. That is so, first, because the relevant CAA provi-\nsion here (\u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)) does not call for any determi-\nnation at all. Unlike the immediately preceding subsection \nand other subsections within the same section, subsection \n7545(o)(9)(B) does not use the phrase \u201cdetermination\u201d or \n\u201cdetermines.\u201d It instead invites a small refinery to peti-\ntion for relief \u201cfor the reason of disproportionate economic \nhardship,\u201d and it says that EPA should \u201cevaluat[e]\u201d that \nhardship petition in consultation with DOE after consid-\nering DOE\u2019s 2011 study and \u201cother economic factors.\u201d \nThere are no statutory \u201cdetermination[s]\u201d in that process. \nTo the extent Section 7545(o)(9)(B) contemplates any \nstatutory determination at all, it calls for a determination \nthat has a local scope and effect. After the blanket RFS \nexemption for small refineries ended in 2011, Congress  \ndirected EPA to extend an exemption for at least two \nmore years \u201c[i]n the case of a small refinery that the Sec-\nretary of Energy determines \u2026 would be subject to a dis-\nproportionate economic hardship if required to comply \nwith\u201d the RFS. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(A)(ii)(II) (emphases added). \nNo longer did all small refineries nationwide get the  \nexemption; only those specific small refineries that were  \ndetermined to face disproportionate economic hardship. \nThat provision required EPA to grant exemptions based \non DOE\u2019s local determination that a particular small  \nrefinery would face hardship. \n \n\n \n34 \nCongress then provided in the very next subsection\u2014\nthe one at issue here\u2014that \u201c[a] small refinery may at any \ntime petition [EPA] for an extension of the exemption  \nunder subparagraph (A) for the reason of disproportion-\nate economic hardship.\u201d \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(i). The reference \nback to \u201csubparagraph (A)\u201d indicates that, when EPA \nconsiders a small refinery\u2019s hardship petition, it must \nmake the same individualized hardship determinations \nthat drove the earlier regime. \nThe plain text of \u201cth[e] chapter\u201d thus compels EPA\u2019s \nhardship decisions to be \u201cbased on\u201d an economic analysis \nfor \u201ca\u201d petitioning small refinery that is local in scope and \neffect. \u00a7 7607(b)(1); \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(i). EPA has said the \nsame thing: the Act \u201cgive[s] EPA the authority to grant \n[a hardship] petition only when a small refinery demon-\nstrates it is experiencing [hardship] caused by compliance \nwith the RFS program.\u201d Pet.App.185a. That must be the \ncore basis for any final action on a hardship petition. \nii. Moreover, the record here shows that EPA in fact \nbased its final actions denying hardship relief on just such \nindividualized conclusions. EPA explained that it had \n\u201ccompleted a thorough evaluation of the data and infor-\nmation provided in the [hardship] petitions, supplemental \nsubmissions, and comments to determine if any of the  \npetitioners have demonstrated that the cost of compliance \nwith the RFS is the cause of their alleged [hardship].\u201d \nPet.App.94a-95a. EPA then found \u201cthat none of the\u201d \npending petitions had \u201cdemonstrated [hardship] caused \nby the cost of compliance with the requirements of the \nRFS program.\u201d Pet.App.185a; accord U.S. Br. 10 (\u201cEPA  \ndetermined that none of the petitioning small refineries \nhad rebutted [the RIN-cost-passthrough] presumption \nthrough evidence about their specific circumstances.\u201d). \n\n \n35 \nTo be sure, EPA had hypothesized in the proposed  \ndenials, before its final actions, that no small refinery \nwould suffer hardship from the RFS because each could \nfully pass through its RIN costs. But that was merely a \nhypothesis. EPA called it then an \u201ceconomic theory,\u201d \nPet.App.212a n.42, 251a; and calls it now (U.S. Br. 8) a \u201cre-\nbuttable presumption.\u201d Whatever it\u2019s called, for EPA to \ntest its hypothesis\u2014to move beyond theory and produce \nfinal agency action on the hardship petitions\u2014EPA con-\ncedes that it needed to, and did, \u201ccarefully review[ ] data, \n[fuel-sales] contracts, and other information from small \nrefineries.\u201d Pet.App.98a-99a. It was only then that EPA \nconcluded (erroneously) that each small refinery actually \n\u201cis recovering its [RFS compliance] costs,\u201d e.g., JA 280, \n286, 298, and for that reason does not face economic hard-\nship, Pet.App.100a. \n* \nBoth the statutory text and record confirm that EPA \ntook these final actions \u201cbased on\u201d conclusions that none \nof the small-refinery respondents would experience  \ndisproportionate economic hardship from the RFS. \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1). Even if those conclusions could qualify as \n\u201cdeterminations\u201d at all, they were local determinations \nbased on an analysis of each refinery\u2019s local evidence, not \nany \u201cdetermination of nationwide scope or effect.\u201d Ibid. \nB. EPA\u2019s arguments seeking D.C. Circuit review fail. \nDespite EPA\u2019s longtime position that its final actions \non hardship petitions are reviewable only in the regional \ncircuit courts, EPA now argues that these denial decisions \nwere nationally applicable, or else were based on a deter-\nmination of nationwide scope or effect. EPA is wrong on \nboth points. \n\n \n36 \n1. EPA gets the \u201caction\u201d wrong. \nEPA does not attempt to argue that its individual \nhardship-petition decisions\u2014as opposed to its bundled  \nexplanations in the April and June Denials of its reasons \nfor denying those petitions\u2014were nationally applicable. \nEPA\u2019s argument thus hangs on this Court being willing to \ncredit its assertion that it produced just two final actions. \nBut the statute shows EPA is wrong about that. It is the \nchapter\u2019s text, not EPA, that establishes what qualifies as \nthe relevant \u201caction\u201d \u201cunder\u201d the CAA. Texas 2023, 2023 \nWL 7204840, at *4. \na. EPA\u2019s brief offers no real attempt to analyze the \nfirst critical phrase in Section 7607(b)(1): \u201cfinal action \u2026 \nunder this chapter.\u201d The government says (U.S. Br. 28-\n29) all that matters is \u201cEPA\u2019s characterization of its own \nagency action\u201d and that courts may not \u201csecond-guess \nEPA\u2019s own framing.\u201d But all agree it is the nature of the \nadministrative action that matters for venue. See pp. 22-\n23, supra. And nothing in the statute gives EPA the power \nto alter the nature of administrative actions just by choos-\ning how to publish those actions (grouped together vs.  \nindividual announcements). EPA\u2019s argument calls back to \nan era before this Court held squarely that \u201ccourts, not \nagencies,\u201d determine \u201cthe meaning of statutory provi-\nsions.\u201d Loper Bright, 603 U.S. at 392, 394. \nThe Sixth Circuit recently explained why it rejected \nthe same argument advanced by the government here: \nthat EPA\u2019s choice of framing, rather than the statutory \ntext, controls what counts as the final action. See Ken-\ntucky, 123 F.4th at 460-463. \u201cThe \u2018structure\u2019 of the judicial-\nreview provision \u2026 focuses on the statute\u201d\u2014not on how \nEPA chose to report its decisions\u2014\u201cto distinguish the \nEPA actions that parties must challenge in the D.C. Cir-\ncuit from those they must challenge in regional circuits.\u201d \n\n \n37 \nId. at 461 (quoting Engine Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. South Coast Air \nQuality Mgmt. Dist., 541 U.S. 246, 252 (2004)). Congress\u2019s \nown designation in Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s first two sen-\ntences of enumerated actions as either nationally applica-\nble or locally applicable, combined with catchall phrases \nfor each sentence, indicates it is the Act, not EPA, that \ngives an action its nature. See ibid. \nEPA\u2019s invocation (U.S. Br. 28) of \u201cthe face of the final \naction\u201d does not advance the analysis. \u201cTh[at] argument \nconflates the [explanation] issued\u201d for EPA\u2019s hardship-\ndenial decisions \u201cwith the \u2018final action\u2019 that the EPA \ntakes.\u201d Kentucky, 123 F.4th at 462 (quoting \u00a7 7607(b)(1)). \nSmall-refinery respondents\u2019 position does not depend on \nthe contents of any petitioner\u2019s court challenge to the \nEPA action or on downstream effects. Venue depends,  \ninstead, on whether the text of the chapter shows the chal-\nlenged action on its face to be more like Section \n7607(b)(1)\u2019s enumerated nationally applicable actions \n(governing the whole nation) or more like the enumerated \nlocally applicable actions that resolve individual parties\u2019 \nrights or obligations. \nb. None of that calls into question EPA\u2019s \u201cfree[dom] \nto fashion [its] own rules of procedure,\u201d including \n\u201c \u2018whether applications should be heard contemporane-\nously or successively.\u2019 \u201d U.S. Br. 26-27 (quoting FCC v. \nPottsville Broad. Co., 309 U.S. 134, 138 (1940)). That free-\ndom includes the \u201cprocess\u201d for taking action; for example, \nthe freedom (where the law permits) to choose between \n\u201crulemaking, individual adjudication, or a combination of \nthe two.\u201d NAACP v. Federal Power Comm\u2019n, 425 U.S. \n662, 668 (1976). EPA could have conducted a rulemaking \nto establish a new interpretation of Section 7545(o)(9)(B) \nand new adjudicatory framework, and such a rule would \nlikely have been nationally applicable. But a new rule like \n\n \n38 \nthat would have needed to be prospective only, see p. 15, \nsupra, which did not meet EPA\u2019s goal here to issue long-\noverdue decisions denying previously submitted small- \nrefinery hardship petitions from prior years.  \nRespondents\u2019 position thus does not disturb EPA\u2019s \nchoice whether to proceed by rulemaking versus adjudi-\ncation. EPA will retain flexibility in running its future \nhardship decisionmaking processes, so long as it examines \neach small refinery\u2019s evidence and adheres to the statu-\ntory decision deadline for final action on each petition. \nWhat EPA may not do is what it attempted here: disre-\ngard whether the CAA\u2019s text calls for local rather than \nnational action. Contrary to EPA\u2019s assertion (U.S. Br. \n26-27), respondents\u2019 textual analysis does not rely merely \non \u201can indefinite article.\u201d As described above (pp. 24-27,  \nsupra), every relevant part of the text and structure of \nSection 7545(o)(9) confirms that Congress wanted RFS \nhardship decisions to be individualized. Cf. Kentucky, 123 \nF.4th at 461 (\u201cthe disapproval of each state plan qualifies \nas a distinct \u2018action\u2019 \u201d). \n2. EPA fails to establish that the hardship decisions \nare nationally applicable. \nWith EPA\u2019s misidentification of the relevant final  \naction corrected, the errors in its remaining arguments \nbecome clear. EPA\u2019s April and June 2022 explanation doc-\numents asserted that the agency had taken nationally  \napplicable actions for two reasons. First, EPA announced \ntogether the denial of hardship petitions submitted by  \nrefineries located in different circuits. Pet.App.185a-188a \n(June 2022 announcement: \u201cThis final action denies 69  \npetitions \u2026 for over 30 small refineries across the coun-\ntry[.]\u201d); Pet.App.327a-330a (similar for April 2022 an-\nnouncement). Second, EPA applied its new statutory \ninterpretation and new economic passthrough hypothesis \n\n \n39 \nto all hardship petitions that the agency adjudicated. E.g., \nPet.App.187a-188a (\u201cEPA\u2019s revised interpretation of the \nrelevant CAA provisions and the RIN discount and RIN \ncost passthrough principles \u2026 are applicable to all small \nrefineries.\u201d). \na. Although EPA defended the second venue argu-\nment in its certiorari petition, U.S. Pet. 10 (arguing that \nthe Denials \u201care \u2018nationally applicable\u2019 because they apply \na uniform methodology to small refineries\u201d), it has now \nabandoned it, making only the geographic argument here. \nU.S. Br. 19-24. Rightly so. Looking to the legal standard \nor reasoning applied would contradict EPA\u2019s long-held \nposition\u2014accepted by multiple courts of appeals\u2014that \nonly \u201cthe face\u201d of the challenged action matters for venue, \nnot the action\u2019s reasoning or effects. See p. 28, supra.9 \nb. EPA\u2019s argument that the actions here were nation-\nally applicable because of geography rests on two errone-\nous premises. First, as discussed just above in Part B.1, it \nwrongly assumes the relevant \u201cactions\u201d are the two docu-\nments explaining EPA\u2019s reasons for denying 105 individ-\nually submitted hardship petitions. \u201c[T]hrow[ing] a \nblanket labeled \u2018national\u2019 over [105] individual decisions\u201d \ndoes not \u201cconvert\u201d them \u201cinto \u2026 national one[s].\u201d West \nVirginia, 90 F.4th at 330. That is especially so when EPA \n \n9  Biofuel respondents\u2019 argument (at Br. 36) that \u201csmall- \nrefinery exemption decisions\u201d are \u201cinherently nationally appli-\ncable\u201d because they affect \u201cthe amount of renewable fuel that \nobligated parties must inject into the nation\u2019s transportation-\nfuel supply\u201d fails for the same reason. The \u201capplicability\u201d in-\nquiry is unconcerned with the \u201cpractical effects\u201d of the EPA \naction. American Road, 705 F.3d at 456 (Kavanaugh, J.). Espe-\ncially a downstream issue like whether EPA chooses to adjust \nvolume obligations for other parties based on outcomes of small \nrefineries\u2019 hardship petitions. \n\n \n40 \nwas able to get all of these individual decisions under its \npurportedly \u201cnational\u201d blanket only by refusing to follow \nthe CAA\u2019s 90-day deadline for answering the hardship  \npetitions. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(iii). Courts generally \u201cwill not \nsuffer a party to profit by his own wrongdoing.\u201d United \nStates v. Houlihan, 92 F.3d 1271, 1279 (1st Cir. 1996). And \nthe government \u201cshould turn square corners in dealing \nwith the people.\u201d Department of Homeland Sec. v.  \nRegents of the Univ. of California, 591 U.S. 1, 24 (2020)  \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \nSecond, EPA now reads the statutory phrase \u201cthe  \nappropriate circuit\u201d to mean that \u201cany action that spans \nmore than one judicial circuit is properly viewed as \u2018na-\ntionally applicable\u2019 and subject to review only in the D.C. \nCircuit.\u201d U.S. Br. 21-22 (quoting \u00a7 7607(b)(1)). According \nto the government (U.S. Br. 21), \u201c[t]he statute\u2019s use of the \ndefinite article \u2026 indicates that, for any given locally or \nregionally applicable EPA action, there is only one appro-\npriate regional court of appeals in which to seek review.\u201d \nThat reading is incorrect. \nNothing in Section 7607(b)(1) indicates that the phrase \n\u201cthe appropriate circuit\u201d informs the meaning of \u201cnation-\nally applicable,\u201d and the plain meaning of \u201cnationally  \napplicable\u201d contradicts EPA\u2019s reading. \u201cNationally\u201d \nmeans \u201cwith regard to the nation as a whole.\u201d Nationally, \nTHE OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY (1971); see Ken-\ntucky, 123 F.4th at 459 (same). Yet on EPA\u2019s reading, an \naction applying to far less than the whole nation\u2014say, one \napplying only to Mississippi and Alabama\u2014would be  \n\u201cnationally applicable.\u201d That is a stretch, to say the least. \nEven accepting arguendo EPA\u2019s view of the relevant \nfinal action, the April and June 2022 Denials were not \u201cna-\ntionally applicable\u201d because they did not cover the whole \nnation like the enumerated actions in Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s \n\n \n41 \nfirst sentence do. They applied to (and bound) only those \nsmall refineries that petitioned for an exemption. See \nPet.App.11a-12a.  \nThe ordinary meaning of \u201cregionally applicable\u201d also \nrebuts EPA\u2019s proffered reading, because that term con-\ntemplates agency actions applying in multiple places \nwithin a region: \u201cof or pertaining to, or connected with, a \nparticular region.\u201d Regional, THE OXFORD ENGLISH \nDICTIONARY (1971). Indeed, EPA\u2019s attempt to put so \nmuch weight on a single definite article produces textually \nabsurd results. Consider EPA\u2019s 250 air quality control  \nregions, some of which cover large metropolitan areas \nthat happen to cross State (and circuit) lines.10 \u201cMetropol-\nitan St. Louis\u201d (Region 70) and \u201cMetropolitan Kansas City\u201d \n(Region 90) are two examples. Can there be any doubt \nthat an EPA disapproval of a regional implementation \nplan for only Region 90 (Metropolitan Kansas City) is a \n\u201cregionally applicable\u201d action for purposes of Section \n7607(b)(1), even though that action touches both the \nEighth and Tenth Circuits? \nCongress did not think so. The 1970 Senate Report  \ninvoked by the government (U.S. Br. 23) said that \u201cimple-\nmentation plans which run only to one air quality control \nregion\u201d should be reviewed in the circuit court \u201cin which \nthe affected air quality control region, or portion thereof, \nis located.\u201d S. Rep. No. 1196, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 41 (1970) \n(emphasis added). Yet according to the government (U.S. \nBr. 22), the circuit courts governing the States affected by \na Kansas City regional action are powerless because \u201cany \naction that spans more than one judicial circuit\u201d must go \nexclusively to the D.C. Circuit. \n \n10 \nSee \nhttps://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/documents/codeta-\nbles/aqcrs.html. \n\n \n42 \nThe Senate Report supports what ordinary usage sug-\ngests about the meaning of \u201cthe appropriate circuit.\u201d \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1) (emphasis added). The use of \u201cthe appropri-\nate circuit\u201d rather than \u201cthe appropriate circuit(s)\u201d re-\nflects merely that Congress often doesn\u2019t legislate with \nlaser-like precision. E.g., United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. \n336, 344 (1971) (\u201cwe cannot pretend that all statutes are \nmodel statutes\u201d). For most EPA final actions (properly \nidentified), it will be readily apparent whether the action \napplies to the whole nation or to some subset\u2014and in the \nlatter instance, which circuit court is \u201cappropriate.\u201d That \nis certainly true for EPA\u2019s RFS hardship decisions, which \naffect only individual small refineries. \nc. Taken together, EPA\u2019s arguments reveal the \nagency\u2019s conscious desire for the power to choose where \nits actions are reviewed. EPA says (U.S. Br. 28-29) that \n\u201caction \u2026 under this chapter\u201d means its own \u201ccharacteri-\nzation\u201d of an action, which courts cannot \u201csecond-guess.\u201d \nAnd EPA further says (U.S. Br. 22) that any time an  \naction affects states or parties in more than one circuit, it \nis automatically entitled to D.C. Circuit review. If EPA \nwere right about both, then the agency could nearly al-\nways manufacture venue in the D.C. Circuit. EPA could \nsimply mush together two small refineries\u2019 RFS hardship \ndecisions, or decisions on two States\u2019 implementation \nplans\u2014even two decisions that have nothing to do with \neach other\u2014and thereby deny the regulated parties the \nopportunity for review by a regional circuit court. \nThe text of Section 7607(b)(1) does not allow that  \nmanipulation. \u201c[V]enue provisions in Acts of Congress \nshould not be so freely construed as to give the Govern-\nment the choice of \u2018a tribunal favorable\u2019 to it.\u201d Travis v. \nUnited States, 364 U.S. 631, 634 (1961) (citation omitted). \n\n \n43 \n3. The hardship decisions were not based on a \ndetermination of nationwide scope or effect. \nEPA asserts (U.S. Br. 33-35) that its individual denial \ndecisions were based on two determinations of nationwide \nscope or effect: \u201cEPA\u2019s revised interpretation of the rele-\nvant CAA provisions and the RIN discount and RIN cost \npassthrough principles.\u201d Pet.App.187a-188a. That mis-\ncharacterizes both the statutory text and the final actions. \na. As an initial matter, neither EPA\u2019s statutory inter-\npretation nor its economic hypothesis was a statutory  \n\u201cdetermination\u201d as the CAA uses that term of art. See pp. \n32-34, supra. Neither describes any issue that the CAA\u2019s \ntext directed EPA to \u201cdetermine\u201d before acting on a small  \nrefinery\u2019s RFS hardship petition. See \u00a7 7545(o)(9).  \nIn the immediately preceding subsection, Congress  \ninstructed EPA to extend two-year hardship exemptions \nbased on DOE\u2019s \u201cdetermin[ation]\u201d about a small refin-\nery\u2019s hardship. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(A)(ii)(II). And elsewhere in \nthe same Section, Congress authorized EPA to grant cer-\ntain waivers, following consultation with DOE, \u201cbased on \na determination by the Administrator \u2026 that implemen-\ntation of the requirement would severely harm the econ-\nomy or environment of a State, a region, or the United \nStates.\u201d \u00a7 7545(o)(7)(A)(i).  \nCongress thus knows how to make actions \u201cbased on a \ndetermination\u201d when it wants to. It did not do that for \nsmall-refinery hardship petitions in Section 7545(o)(9)(B). \nEPA\u2019s position wrongly depends on treating \u201cdetermina-\ntion\u201d in Section 7607(b)(1) not as a statutory term of art \nbut rather as some amorphous concept of anything that \ncontributed significantly to a final action.  \nb. Even if Section 7607(b)(1) used \u201cdetermination\u201d in \nthe colloquial sense, EPA would still be wrong about the \nbasis for these hardship-petition denial actions. \n\n \n44 \ni. EPA\u2019s first suggestion\u2014that a statutory interpre-\ntation can qualify as a \u201cdetermination of nationwide scope \nor effect\u201d\u2014is nothing less than an argument that every \nEPA action must go to the D.C. Circuit. EPA is a \u201ccrea-\nture[ ] of statute,\u201d so \u201cit possess[es] only the authority that \nCongress has provided.\u201d National Fed\u2019n of Indep. Bus. v. \nDep\u2019t of Lab., Occupational Safety & Health Admin., 595 \nU.S. 109, 117, (2022). Every EPA action is necessarily \n\u201cbased on\u201d the agency\u2019s understanding of its statutory  \nauthority. \nIt similarly cannot be the case (contra U.S. Br. 34) that \nEPA\u2019s denial actions here were based on a nationwide  \ndetermination because EPA applied a statutory interpre-\ntation \u201cuniformly\u201d to them. If EPA had not done that\u2014if \nit had applied a different statutory reading to similarly \nsituated small-refinery petitioners\u2014that would be the \nheight of arbitrariness. So \u201cif application of a national \nstandard \u2026 were the controlling factor, there never could \nbe a local or regional action\u201d because every EPA action \n\u201cpurportedly applies a national standard created by the \nnational statute and its national regulations.\u201d West Vir-\nginia, 90 F.4th at 329-330. This Court should not read the \nnarrow nationwide-scope-or-effect exception to \u201cswallow \nthe\u201d local-or-regionally-applicable rule. Cuomo v. Clear-\ning House Ass\u2019n, L.L.C., 557 U.S. 519, 530 (2009). \nThe most obvious examples of locally applicable  \nactions involve EPA applying a uniform statutory stand-\nard to individual regulated parties\u2019 factual circumstances. \nAccord U.S. Br. 42. Acknowledging that reality, EPA  \nultimately abandons any argument based on application \nof a \u201cuniform\u201d standard, conceding (U.S. Br. 41) that EPA \n\u201cdoes not\u201d make a nationwide-scope determination \u201cwhen \nit merely applies a previously established agency \u2026 inter-\npretation to new \u2018locally or regionally applicable\u2019 circum-\n\n \n45 \nstances.\u201d That describes what EPA did in the final actions \nchallenged here: It applied its statutory interpretation to \neach petitioning small refinery\u2019s evidence about its local \neconomic circumstances. See pp. 34-35, supra. \nInsofar as EPA contends (U.S. Br. 33, 41) that what \nmatters here is that it promulgated its \u201cnew interpreta-\ntion\u201d at \u201croughly the same time\u201d it denied the hardship \npetitions, that argument does not rebut the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \nvenue conclusion. For one thing, that argument would not \nextend to the June 2022 Denial decisions, which merely \napplied the statutory interpretation that EPA had an-\nnounced months earlier in April. Pet.App.80a.11 \nIn any event, EPA\u2019s choice to offer a new statutory \nanalysis cannot alter what determination the statute  \nrequired as the basis for every small-refinery hardship \ndecision. The text does not ask whether the agency made \nsome determination of nationwide scope or effect in con-\nnection with the action. It asks whether EPA \u201cbased\u201d its \nfinal action on such a determination. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). Here, as \nexplained above, the basis for these final actions must by \nlaw be findings about the individual petitioning small  \n \n11  Despite EPA repeatedly referring to the April and June \nDenials as two separate actions, EPA simultaneously argues \nthat those explanation documents should be treated as one for \npurposes of establishing its new adjudication approach to hard-\nship petitions. U.S. Br. 42-43 n.6. EPA urges this Court (ibid.) \nto disregard the \u201ctime that passed between the[ir] finalization\u201d \nbecause \u201c[b]oth denial actions here stemmed from a single \npropos[al].\u201d But obviously one proposal can lead ultimately to \nmultiple final actions. And according to the face of the June  \nexplanation document, it was only the April explanation docu-\nment that broke new ground: \u201cIn this action, EPA is applying \nthe approach proposed on December 7, 2021, and adopted in \nthe April 2022 [RFS] Denial.\u201d Pet.App.80a (emphases added). \n\n \n46 \nrefineries\u2019 economic circumstances. And EPA has admit-\nted that these hardship decisions were based on just that. \nSee p. 34, supra. \nMoreover, EPA\u2019s new statutory interpretation was \nnot sufficient to produce final agency action in this con-\ntext. Recall that EPA could not, and did not, use a rule-\nmaking for its new interpretation\u2014because to do so here \nwould plainly have been illegally retroactive. If EPA had \nwanted judicial review to focus on its new statutory inter-\npretation (U.S. Br. 42), it could have run a (lawful) rule-\nmaking process. But EPA expressly chose to proceed only \nby adjudication. See Pet.App.188 (\u201cThis action is not a \nrulemaking\u201d). That choice meant that EPA could produce \n\u201cfinal action \u2026 under this chapter\u201d not by analyzing the \nstatute but rather only by evaluating the petitioning small \nrefineries\u2019 economic evidence. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). \nIt is also no answer for EPA to contend (U.S. Br. 35, \n42) that a case must go to the D.C. Circuit when \u201ccircum-\nstances suggest\u201d that EPA\u2019s statutory interpretation is \n\u201clikely to be called into question\u201d in the litigation. That \nflies in the face of the courts\u2019 consistent holding (and \nEPA\u2019s consistent position) that what matters is EPA\u2019s  \n\u201cfinal action,\u201d not the petitioner\u2019s arguments challenging \nit. See pp. 7-8, supra. It will not always be apparent at the \noutset of litigation, when venue is typically (and most effi-\nciently) resolved, what aspects of an EPA action will be \ncalled into question. \nThe better answer is the simpler one that also gives \nthe statutory terms their ordinary meaning: An EPA  \naction is based on a determination of nationwide scope or \neffect in the rare instance when the CAA\u2019s text directs \nEPA to make a factual \u201cdetermination\u201d about the entire \nnation or industry, without the need to consider individual \ncircumstances. \n\n \n47 \nii. For many of the same reasons, EPA\u2019s RIN-cost-\npassthrough hypothesis did not make these hardship  \ndenial actions based on a determination of nationwide \nscope or effect. Even if EPA\u2019s passthrough hypothesis \ncould qualify as a \u201cdetermination\u201d under the statute when \nthe text does not describe it that way, see pp. 33-34, supra, \nthe actions denying the hardship petitions were not \n\u201cbased on\u201d it, \u00a7 7607(b)(1). EPA had merely a hypothe-\nsis\u2014an \u201canalysis of how\u201d EPA \u201cexpected\u201d individual fuels \nmarkets to respond, Pet.App.163a-165a\u2014that EPA \nneeded to test, and did test, against each hardship peti-\ntion\u2019s evidence. See pp. 34-35, supra. Only that analysis of \neach refinery\u2019s individual evidence could be the \u201cbas[is]\u201d \nfor \u201cfinal action[s]\u201d denying respondents\u2019 hardship peti-\ntions. \u00a7 7607(b)(1) (emphasis added). \nEPA\u2019s actions were not \u201cbased on\u201d any supposedly  \nnationwide RIN-cost-passthrough determination for the \nadditional reason that, with or without any nationwide  \nassessment, EPA\u2019s denial actions here would have been \nexactly the same. The government agrees (U.S. Br. 41) \nthat the textual \u201ccausation requirement\u201d in Section \n7607(b)(1) means that \u201cthe relevant determinations\u201d must \nbe \u201cat the core of EPA\u2019s action.\u201d But here, EPA did not \nneed any nationwide finding about any other refineries to \nconclude, as it wrongly did in the denial actions, that each \nof the small-refinery respondents were \u201cable to pass along \nRFS compliance costs,\u201d were \u201crecovering [their] costs,\u201d \nand so were suffering \u201cno economic harm.\u201d Pet.App.99a-\n100a, 165a; JA 280.  \nIn short, the conclusion that drove each denial decision \nwas not that all obligated parties recover their RFS costs; \nit was that each of these respondents (purportedly) does. \nAs EPA itself explains (U.S. Br. 10): It denied respond-\nents\u2019 hardship petitions because it \u201cdetermined that none \n\n \n48 \nof the petitioning small refineries had rebutted [the RIN-\ncost-passthrough] presumption through evidence about \ntheir specific circumstances.\u201d Those were conclusions \nabout specific refineries, not nationwide determinations.12 \nc. EPA invokes the history (U.S. Br. 35-38) of the \nthird-sentence exception in Section 7607(b)(1), but that \nhistory actually undermines EPA\u2019s position. As recounted \nabove, the exception was prompted by General Counsel \nFrick\u2019s description of an atypical CAA provision that, \nthough calling for a local action (an extension for specific \nStates), textually required EPA\u2019s action to be based on a \ndetermination about technology available throughout the \nindustry. See pp. 8-9, supra. That extension action did not \nrequire or even contemplate any consideration of individ-\nualized State circumstances; EPA was tasked instead \nwith making a finding about the technology available \nthroughout the nation. \nEPA\u2019s actions on small-refinery hardship petitions \nlook nothing like that. The text of Section 7545(o)(9)(B), \nunlike the unusual provision that Frick described, does \nnot ask EPA to make any \u201cdetermination\u201d about the  \nentire nation or industry as a basis for granting hardship \nrelief. It does not call for any determination at all. To the \nextent it does, it calls for a determination about the indi-\nvidual petitioning small refinery\u2019s economic circum-\nstances. See pp. 33-34, supra. \nEPA responds by catastrophizing (U.S. Br. 38) that if \nthe denials here do not qualify as based on nationwide  \n \n12  EPA\u2019s footnoted discussion (U.S. Br. 34 n.5) of how it \nchooses to respond to granted hardship petitions is irrelevant \nto Section 7607(b)(1), because those downstream choices by the \nagency say nothing about what was the \u201cbas[is]\u201d for the final \ndenial actions here. \n\n \n49 \ndeterminations, then the third-sentence exception to Sec-\ntion 7607(b)(1) will be \u201cpractically insignificant.\u201d But the \nthird sentence was always meant to state an exception to \nthe general rule for locally applicable actions. General \nCounsel Frick urged the exception\u2019s adoption to address \na CAA provision that has since been repealed. That is \nlikely why, before the cases involving EPA\u2019s denial deci-\nsions here, no court had ever found a locally applicable \nEPA action that was based on a determination of nation-\nwide scope or effect. The exception is properly narrow. \nd. EPA concludes by resorting to a policy argument: \nIt asks this Court to read \u201cbased on a determination of  \nnationwide scope or effect\u201d broadly, on the theory that  \njudicial review will be more efficient if the D.C. Circuit \nalone considers issues like EPA\u2019s statutory analysis and \nmethodological framework.  \nAppeals to policy cannot supersede the ordinary \nmeaning of the terms in Section 7607(b)(1) or the confir-\nmation of their meaning in the statutory context and his-\ntory. Niz-Chavez v. Garland, 593 U.S. 155, 171 (2021) (\u201cno \namount of policy-talk can overcome a plain statutory com-\nmand\u201d). And in any event, EPA\u2019s policy argument falls \nflat. If EPA wants to propound a new statutory interpre-\ntation and have it reviewed by only the D.C. Circuit, then \nthe agency need only adopt that interpretation through a \nlawful rulemaking process. \nExperience has proven EPA wrong in suggesting that \nconsolidated D.C. Circuit review of CAA actions is always \nor usually best. The litigation here is a perfect example. \nBecause EPA persuaded several regional circuit courts to \ntransfer small refineries\u2019 challenges to their hardship- \ndenial decisions, the D.C. Circuit ended up hearing one \nmassive case consolidating dozens of small refineries\u2019  \npetitions for review. See p. 18, supra. That consolidation \n\n \n50 \nmade the D.C. Circuit litigation take much longer than \nother small refineries\u2019 regional-circuit challenges to \nEPA\u2019s denials of their hardship petitions.  \nEven more important, consolidation in the D.C. Cir-\ncuit made it very difficult for the individual small refiner-\nies to get judicial attention on what ultimately matters \nmost: their specific economic circumstances that give rise \nto their disproportionate economic hardship from the \nRFS. To take just one example: In the mass D.C. Circuit \nchallenge alongside dozens of co-petitioners, there was no \neasy way for a small refinery affiliated with one respond-\nent here, Calumet Montana, to ask the court to focus on \nthe idiosyncrasies of producing blended diesel fuel in a \ncold climate in winter. Yet that is exactly the sort of con-\ndition that causes Calumet Montana to face dispropor-\ntionate economic hardship from the RFS. \nEPA\u2019s preference for near-universal D.C. Circuit  \nreview would obscure the judiciary\u2019s consideration of  \nindividual regulated entities\u2019 circumstances, contrary to \nthe essential logic of Congress\u2019s plan for a national vs.  \nlocal divide in Section 7607(b)(1). \n\n \n51 \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be af-\nfirmed. \nRespectfully submitted, \nLeAnn M.

For the 50 and 60 percent reduc-\ntions, the Administrator may make such an adjust-\nment only if he determines that generally such reduc-\ntion is not commercially feasible for fuels made using \na variety of feedstocks, technologies, and processes to \nmeet the applicable reduction. \n(B) Amount of adjustment \nIn promulgating regulations under this paragraph, \nthe specified 50 percent reduction in greenhouse gas \nemissions from advanced biofuel and in biomass-based \ndiesel may not be reduced below 40 percent. The spec-\nified 20 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions \nfrom renewable fuel may not be reduced below 10 per-\ncent, and the specified 60 percent reduction in green-\nhouse gas emissions from cellulosic biofuel may not be \nreduced below 50 percent. \n(C) Adjusted reduction levels \nAn adjustment under this paragraph to a percent less \nthan the specified 20 percent greenhouse gas reduc-\ntion for renewable fuel shall be the minimum possible \nadjustment, and the adjusted greenhouse gas reduc-\ntion shall be established by the Administrator at the \nmaximum achievable level, taking cost in consider-\n\n14a \n \nation, for natural gas fired corn-based ethanol plants, \nallowing for the use of a variety of technologies and \nprocesses. An adjustment in the 50 or 60 percent \ngreenhouse gas levels shall be the minimum possible \nadjustment for the fuel or fuels concerned, and the ad-\njusted greenhouse gas reduction shall be established \nat the maximum achievable level, taking cost in con-\nsideration, allowing for the use of a variety of feed-\nstocks, technologies, and processes. \n(D) 5-year review \nWhenever the Administrator makes any adjustment \nunder this paragraph, not later than 5 years thereafter \nhe shall review and revise (based upon the same crite-\nria and standards as required for the initial adjust-\nment) the regulations establishing the adjusted level. \n(E) Subsequent adjustments \nAfter the Administrator has promulgated a final rule \nunder the last sentence of paragraph (2)(A)(i) with re-\nspect to the method of determining lifecycle green-\nhouse gas emissions, except as provided in subpara-\ngraph (D), the Administrator may not adjust the per-\ncent greenhouse gas reduction levels unless he deter-\nmines that there has been a significant change in the \nanalytical methodology used for determining the \nlifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. If he makes such \ndetermination, he may adjust the 20, 50, or 60 percent \nreduction levels through rulemaking using the criteria \nand standards set forth in this paragraph. \n(F) Limit on upward adjustments \nIf, under subparagraph (D) or (E), the Administrator \nrevises a percent level adjusted as provided in subpar-\nagraphs (A), (B), and (C) to a higher percent, such \nhigher percent may not exceed the applicable percent \n\n15a \n \nspecified in paragraph (2)(A)(i), (1)(D), (1)(B)(i), or \n(1)(E). \n(G) Applicability of adjustments \nIf the Administrator adjusts, or revises, a percent \nlevel referred to in this paragraph or makes a change \nin the analytical methodology used for determining \nthe lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions, such adjust-\nment, revision, or change (or any combination thereof) \nshall only apply to renewable fuel from new facilities \nthat commence construction after the effective date of \nsuch adjustment, revision, or change. \n(5) Credit program \n(A) In general \nThe regulations promulgated under paragraph (2)(A) \nshall provide\u2014 \n(i) for the generation of an appropriate amount of \ncredits by any person that refines, blends, or imports \ngasoline that contains a quantity of renewable fuel \nthat is greater than the quantity required under para-\ngraph (2); \n(ii) for the generation of an appropriate amount of \ncredits for biodiesel; and  \n(iii) for the generation of credits by small refiner-\nies in accordance with paragraph (9)(C). \n(B) Use of credits \nA person that generates credits under subparagraph \n(A) may use the credits, or transfer all or a portion of \nthe credits to another person, for the purpose of com-\nplying with paragraph (2). \n\n16a \n \n(C) Duration of credits \nA credit generated under this paragraph shall be valid \nto show compliance for the 12 months as of the date of \ngeneration. \n(D) Inability to generate or purchase sufficient \ncredits \nThe regulations promulgated under paragraph (2)(A) \nshall include provisions allowing any person that is un-\nable to generate or purchase sufficient credits to meet \nthe requirements of paragraph (2) to carry forward a \nrenewable fuel deficit on condition that the person, in \nthe calendar year following the year in which the re-\nnewable fuel deficit is created\u2014 \n(i) achieves compliance with the renewable fuel re-\nquirement under paragraph (2); and \n(ii) generates or purchases additional renewable \nfuel credits to offset the renewable fuel deficit of the \nprevious year. \n(E) Credits for additional renewable fuel \nThe Administrator may issue regulations providing: \n(i) for the generation of an appropriate amount of cred-\nits by any person that refines, blends, or imports addi-\ntional renewable fuels specified by the Administrator; \nand (ii) for the use of such credits by the generator, or \nthe transfer of all or a portion of the credits to another \nperson, for the purpose of complying with paragraph \n(2). \n(6) Seasonal variations in renewable fuel use \n(A) Study \nFor each of calendar years 2006 through 2012, the Ad-\nministrator of the Energy Information Administration \nshall conduct a study of renewable fuel blending to \n\n17a \n \ndetermine whether there are excessive seasonal vari-\nations in the use of renewable fuel. \n(B) Regulation of excessive seasonal variations \nIf, for any calendar year, the Administrator of the En-\nergy Information Administration, based on the study \nunder subparagraph (A), makes the determinations \nspecified in subparagraph (C), the Administrator of \nthe Environmental Protection Agency shall promul-\ngate regulations to ensure that 25 percent or more of \nthe quantity of renewable fuel necessary to meet the \nrequirements of paragraph (2) is used during each of \nthe 2 periods specified in subparagraph (D) of each \nsubsequent calendar year. \n(C) Determinations \nThe determinations referred to in subparagraph (B) \nare that\u2014 \n(i)  less than 25 percent of the quantity of renewa-\nble fuel necessary to meet the requirements of para-\ngraph (2) has been used during 1 of the 2 periods spec-\nified in subparagraph (D) of the calendar year; \n(ii)  a pattern of excessive seasonal variation de-\nscribed in clause (i) will continue in subsequent calen-\ndar years; and promulgating regulations or other re-\nquirements to impose a 25 percent or more seasonal \nuse of renewable fuels will not prevent or interfere \nwith the attainment of national ambient air quality \nstandards or significantly increase the price of motor \nfuels to the consumer. \n(D) Periods \nThe 2 periods referred to in this paragraph are\u2014 \n(i)  April through September; and  \n(ii) January through March and October through \nDecember. \n\n18a \n \n(E) Exclusion \nRenewable fuel blended or consumed in calendar year \n2006 in a State that has received a waiver under sec-\ntion 7543(b) of this title shall not be included in the \nstudy under subparagraph (A). \n(F) State exemption from seasonality require-\nments \nNotwithstanding any other provision of law, the sea-\nsonality requirement relating to renewable fuel use es-\ntablished by this paragraph shall not apply to any \nState that has received a waiver under section 7543(b) \nof this title or any State dependent on refineries in \nsuch State for gasoline supplies. \n(7) Waivers \n(A) In general \nThe Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary \nof Agriculture and the Secretary of Energy, may \nwaive the requirements of paragraph (2) in whole or in \npart on petition by one or more States, by any person \nsubject to the requirements of this subsection, or by \nthe Administrator on his own motion by reducing the \nnational quantity of renewable fuel required under \nparagraph (2)\u2014 \n(i) based on a determination by the Administrator, \nafter public notice and opportunity for comment, that \nimplementation of the requirement would severely \nharm the economy or environment of a State, a region, \nor the United States; or \n(ii) based on a determination by the Administrator, \nafter public notice and opportunity for comment, that \nthere is an inadequate domestic supply. \n\n19a \n \n(B) Petitions for waivers \nThe Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary \nof Agriculture and the Secretary of Energy, shall ap-\nprove or disapprove a petition for a waiver of the re-\nquirements of paragraph (2) within 90 days after the \ndate on which the petition is received by the Adminis-\ntrator. \n(C) Termination of waivers \nA waiver granted under subparagraph (A) shall termi-\nnate after 1 year, but may be renewed by the Admin-\nistrator after consultation with the Secretary of Agri-\nculture and the Secretary of Energy. \n(D) Cellulosic biofuel \n(i) For any calendar year for which the projected \nvolume of cellulosic biofuel production is less than the \nminimum applicable volume established under para-\ngraph (2)(B), as determined by the Administrator \nbased on the estimate provided under paragraph \n(3)(A), not later than November 30 of the preceding \ncalendar year, the Administrator shall reduce the ap-\nplicable volume of cellulosic biofuel required under \nparagraph (2)(B) to the projected volume available \nduring that calendar year. For any calendar year in \nwhich the Administrator makes such a reduction, the \nAdministrator may also reduce the applicable volume \nof renewable fuel and advanced biofuels requirement \nestablished under paragraph (2)(B) by the same or a \nlesser volume. \n(ii) Whenever the Administrator reduces the min-\nimum cellulosic biofuel volume under this subpara-\ngraph, the Administrator shall make available for sale \ncellulosic biofuel credits at the higher of $0.25 per gal-\nlon or the amount by which $3.00 per gallon exceeds \nthe average wholesale price of a gallon of gasoline in \n\n20a \n \nthe United States. Such amounts shall be adjusted for \ninflation by the Administrator for years after 2008. \n(iii)  Eighteen months after December 19, 2007, the \nAdministrator shall promulgate regulations to govern \nthe issuance of credits under this subparagraph. The \nregulations shall set forth the method for determining \nthe exact price of credits in the event of a waiver. The \nprice of such credits shall not be changed more fre-\nquently than once each quarter. These regulations \nshall include such provisions, including limiting the \ncredits\u2019 uses and useful life, as the Administrator \ndeems appropriate to assist market liquidity and \ntransparency, to provide appropriate certainty for \nregulated entities and renewable fuel producers, and \nto limit any potential misuse of cellulosic biofuel cred-\nits to reduce the use of other renewable fuels, and for \nsuch other purposes as the Administrator determines \nwill help achieve the goals of this subsection. The reg-\nulations shall limit the number of cellulosic biofuel \ncredits for any calendar year to the minimum applica-\nble volume (as reduced under this subparagraph) of \ncellulosic biofuel for that year. \n(E) Biomass-based diesel \n(i)  Market evaluation \nThe Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary \nof Energy and the Secretary of Agriculture, shall pe-\nriodically evaluate the impact of the biomass-based \ndiesel requirements established under this paragraph \non the price of diesel fuel. \n(ii)  Waiver \nIf the Administrator determines that there is a signif-\nicant renewable feedstock disruption or other market \ncircumstances that would make the price of biomass-\nbased diesel fuel increase significantly, the Admin- \n\n21a \n \nistrator, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy \nand the Secretary of Agriculture, shall issue an order \nto reduce, for up to a 60-day period, the quantity of bi-\nomass-based diesel required under subparagraph (A) \nby an appropriate quantity that does not exceed 15 \npercent of the applicable annual requirement for bio-\nmass-based diesel. For any calendar year in which the \nAdministrator makes a reduction under this subpara-\ngraph, the Administrator may also reduce the applica-\nble volume of renewable fuel and advanced biofuels re-\nquirement established under paragraph (2)(B) by the \nsame or a lesser volume. \n(iii) Extensions \nIf the Administrator determines that the feedstock \ndisruption or circumstances described in clause (ii) is \ncontinuing beyond the 60-day period described in \nclause (ii) or this clause, the Administrator, in consul-\ntation with the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary \nof Agriculture, may issue an order to reduce, for up to \nan additional 60-day period, the quantity of biomass-\nbased diesel required under subparagraph (A) by an \nappropriate quantity that does not exceed an addi-\ntional 15 percent of the applicable annual requirement \nfor biomass-based diesel. \n(F) Modification of applicable volumes \nFor any of the tables in paragraph (2)(B), if the Ad-\nministrator waives\u2014 \n(i) at least 20 percent of the applicable volume re-\nquirement set forth in any such table for 2 consecutive \nyears; or \n(ii) at least 50 percent of such volume requirement \nfor a single year, the Administrator shall promulgate \na rule (within 1 year after issuing such waiver) that \nmodifies the applicable volumes set forth in the table \n\n22a \n \nconcerned for all years following the final year to \nwhich the waiver applies, except that no such modifi-\ncation in applicable volumes shall be made for any year \nbefore 2016. In promulgating such a rule, the Admin-\nistrator shall comply with the processes, criteria, and \nstandards set forth in paragraph (2)(B)(ii). \n(8) Study and waiver for initial year of program \n(A) In general \nNot later than 180 days after August 8, 2005, the Sec-\nretary of Energy shall conduct for the Administrator \na study assessing whether the renewable fuel require-\nment under paragraph (2) will likely result in signifi-\ncant adverse impacts on consumers in 2006, on a na-\ntional, regional, or State basis. \n(B) Required evaluations \nThe study shall evaluate renewable fuel\u2014 \n(i) supplies and prices; \n(ii) blendstock supplies; and  \n(iii) supply and distribution system capabilities. \n(C) Recommendations by the Secretary \nBased on the results of the study, the Secretary of En-\nergy shall make specific recommendations to the Ad-\nministrator concerning waiver of the requirements of \nparagraph (2), in whole or in part, to prevent any ad-\nverse impacts described in subparagraph (A). \n(D) Waiver \n(i)  In general \nNot later than 270 days after August 8, 2005, the Ad-\nministrator shall, if and to the extent recommended by \nthe Secretary of Energy under subparagraph (C), \nwaive, in whole or in part, the renewable fuel require-\nment under paragraph (2) by reducing the national \n\n23a \n \nquantity of renewable fuel required under paragraph \n(2) in calendar year 2006. \n(ii)  No effect on waiver authority \nClause (i) does not limit the authority of the Adminis-\ntrator to waive the requirements of paragraph (2) in \nwhole, or in part, under paragraph (7). \n(9)  Small refineries \n(A) Temporary exemption \n(i) In general \nThe requirements of paragraph (2) shall not apply to \nsmall refineries until calendar year 2011. \n(ii)  Extension of exemption \n(I) Study by Secretary of Energy \nNot later than December 31, 2008, the Secretary of \nEnergy shall conduct for the Administrator a study to de-\ntermine whether compliance with the requirements of \nparagraph (2) would impose a disproportionate economic \nhardship on small refineries. \n(II) Extension of exemption \nIn the case of a small refinery that the Secretary \nof Energy determines under subclause (I) would be sub-\nject to a disproportionate economic hardship if required \nto comply with paragraph (2), the Administrator shall ex-\ntend the exemption under clause (i) for the small refinery \nfor a period of not less than 2 additional years. \n(B) Petitions based on disproportionate eco-\nnomic hardship \n(i) Extension of exemption \nA small refinery may at any time petition the Admin-\nistrator for an extension of the exemption under \n\n24a \n \nsubparagraph (A) for the reason of disproportionate \neconomic hardship. \n(ii) Evaluation of petitions \nIn evaluating a petition under clause (i), the Adminis-\ntrator, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, \nshall consider the findings of the study under subpar-\nagraph (A)(ii) and other economic factors. \n(iii) Deadline for action on petitions \nThe Administrator shall act on any petition submitted \nby a small refinery for a hardship exemption not later \nthan 90 days after the date of receipt of the petition. \n(C) Credit program \nIf a small refinery notifies the Administrator that the \nsmall refinery waives the exemption under subpara-\ngraph (A), the regulations promulgated under para-\ngraph (2)(A) shall provide for the generation of credits \nby the small refinery under paragraph (5) beginning \nin the calendar year following the date of notification. \n(D) Opt-in for small refineries \nA small refinery shall be subject to the requirements \nof paragraph (2) if the small refinery notifies the Ad-\nministrator that the small refinery waives the exemp-\ntion under subparagraph (A). \n(10)  Ethanol market concentration analysis \n(A) Analysis \n(i) In general \nNot later than 180 days after August 8, 2005, and an-\nnually thereafter, the Federal Trade Commission \nshall perform a market concentration analysis of the \nethanol production industry using the Herfindahl-\nHirschman Index to determine whether there is \n\n25a \n \nsufficient competition among industry participants to \navoid price-setting and other anticompetitive behav-\nior. \n(ii) Scoring \nFor the purpose of scoring under clause (i) using the \nHerfindahl-Hirschman Index, all marketing arrange-\nments among industry participants shall be consid-\nered. \n(B) Report \nNot later than December 1, 2005, and annually there-\nafter, the Federal Trade Commission shall submit to \nCongress and the Administrator a report on the re-\nsults of the market concentration analysis performed \nunder subparagraph (A)(i). \n(11) Periodic reviews \nTo allow for the appropriate adjustment of the re-\nquirements described in subparagraph (B) of para-\ngraph (2), the Administrator shall conduct periodic re-\nviews of\u2014 \n(A) existing technologies;

      "eig_reasoning": "The legal question is narrowly focused on whether the EPA's denial of small refinery exemptions constitutes an action of 'nationwide scope or effect,' thus vesting exclusive jurisdiction in the D.C. Circuit. The petitioner, EPA, argues that it is. This search action specifically targets amicus briefs filed in support of the petitioner's position. These briefs are highly likely to contain detailed legal and policy arguments directly supporting the 'nationwide scope' interpretation, which is the core of the case. Understanding these arguments from key stakeholders (like renewable fuel producers) is crucial for a complete analysis of the legal landscape and predicting the Court's reasoning. Therefore, the task EIG is high.\n\nFrom a design perspective, this action tests the strategy of systematically analyzing amicus support for each party. After likely reviewing the main briefs and perhaps amicus support for the respondents, examining the petitioner's amicus support is a logical and important step. It helps refine the general methodology of weighing the arguments and coalitions on each side of a case, which is a key element of SCOTUS prediction. This action will provide insight into the value of targeted amicus searches versus more general searches, improving my overall prediction process. Therefore, the design EIG is also significant.",

It is headquartered \nin Indiana.\nCountryMark has a significant interest in this \nappeal because, while small refineries (rightly) prevailed \nin the recent Sinclair Wyoming decision in the D.C. \nCircuit, CountryMark did not get its own day in court \nto specifically and fully address the disproportionate \neconomic hardship that is suffers. CountryMark\u2019s case \nwas improperly consolidated with those of 25 other small \nrefineries. See Sinclair Wyoming Refin. Co. LLC v. EPA, \n101 F.4th 871 (D.C. Cir. 2024). As a result, CountryMark\u2019s \nparticular economic circumstances were mentioned in \njust two sentences in the briefs before the D.C. Circuit. It \nhad no chance to fully and fairly explain how denial of its \nhardship petitions could jeopardize its ability to continue \noperating.\nThe demise of CountryMark would significantly \nharm the rural region in which it operates. CountryMark \nemploys nearly 500 workers, concentrated in the rural \neconomy of southwest Indiana and southeast Illinois. \n1.\u2002 No counsel for a party authored this brief in whole or in \npart. No such counsel or a party made a monetary contribution \nintended to fund the preparation or submission of this brief. No \nperson other than the amicus curiae, its members, or its counsel, \nmade such a monetary contribution.\n\n2\nIn Posey County, Indiana, a county with only 25,000 \nresidents, CountryMark provides over $30 million in \nwages and benefits each year. In 2024, it purchased over \n$800 million of crude oil primarily from the Illinois Basin, \nand those purchases provided income to the 40,000 royalty \nowners in the Illinois Basin. Its products are also sold and \ndistributed through its branded dealer network, providing \nemployment throughout rural communities in its area.\nCountryMark is the only farmer-owned integrated \noil company in the United States, and it is recognized in \nIndiana as a leader in the distribution of biodiesel and \nethanol. Its refinery, which uses 100% American crude \noil, processes 35,000 barrels of crude per day. It supplies \nover 70% of agricultural market fuels and 50% of school \ndistrict fuels in Indiana. Although CountryMark is a \ncritical participant in its regional market, it operates as \na small refinery relative to its peers, with a capacity that \nis merely one-tenth the size of the average refinery in its \nregion.\nCountryMark is precisely the type of small refinery \nCongress envisioned when enacting Small Refinery \nExemptions (\u201cSRE\u201d). For CountryMark, SREs are not \na mechanism to avoid compliance with Congressional \nmandates; rather, they are vital tools to sustain economic \nviability while advancing renewable fuel adoption\u2014an \neffort CountryMark has championed since before such \nmandates existed.\nCountryMark is an Obligated Party under the \nRenewable Fuel Standard (\u201cRFS\u201d). Despite its early \nadoption of renewable fuels, CountryMark\u2019s customers \nare unable or unwilling to blend sufficient renewable \n\n3\nfuels to meet the company\u2019s annual RFS obligations. \nWhile CountryMark has invested significantly in blending \ninfrastructure, the continued escalation of Renewable \nVolume Obligations (\u201cRVOs\u201d), combined with rising \nRenewable Identification Number (\u201cRIN\u201d) prices, renders \ncompliance financially unsustainable without relief \nthrough SREs.\nTo address the economic hardship imposed by the \nRFS, CountryMark has sought SREs under the Clean \nAir Act (\u201cCAA\u201d). By statute, these exemptions must be \ndetermined based on the applicant\u2019s individual economic \ncircumstances. When the Environmental Protection \nAgency (\u201cEPA\u201d) denied CountryMark\u2019s RFS hardship \npetitions, CountryMark sought judicial review in its \nregional circuit. But, on EPA\u2019s motion, the cases were \ntransferred to the D.C. Circuit and consolidated with other \nrefineries\u2019 petitions, denying CountryMark its statutory \nright to review of its particular economic hardships by \nits regional circuit. CountryMark thus has significant \ninterest in this Court\u2019s affirmance of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \ndetermination that the proper venue for review of EPA\u2019s \ndecisions on SRE petitions is the small refinery\u2019s regional \ncircuit.\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\nThe Fifth Circuit correctly determined that the \nproper venue for judicial review of EPA\u2019s decision on \nSRE petitions is the regional circuit of the petitioning \nsmall refinery. The specific economic circumstances of \nthe small refinery and the area in which it operates are \nthe statutorily required and exclusive bases for EPA \ndeterminations of RFS hardship applications. A small \n\n4\nrefinery is almost by definition a local or regional concern. \nSee 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07545(o)(1)(K). Thus, the SRE applicant\u2019s \nregional circuit is best suited to address the application \nand the local economic realities that should underlie EPA\u2019s \ndecision.\nCongress concluded that localized EPA decisions \nshould be reviewed by local jurisdictions. 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a07607(b)(1). That is a rational division of labor for at least \nthree reasons.\nFirst, local jurisdictions are best equipped to render \ndecisions based on local economic realities. Indeed, in \nlarge measure, that is the very purpose of having regional \ncourts of appeals. EPA, along with supporting amici from \ntrade associations that represent non-obligated entities, \nwrongly assume that fuel prices are generally set in the \ncontext of a national market. All states and regions have \ndifferent fuel prices, which are driven by the supply and \ndemand in local markets. Anyone who travels regularly \ncan attest that fuel prices in Indiana, California, and \nLouisiana differ widely\u2014driven by local or regional supply \nand demand. Fuel prices in Posey County in southern \nIndiana are noticeably different from those of Chicago-\nadjacent Lake County, Indiana. CountryMark, which is an \nObligated Party, operates wholesale terminals in several \nmarkets and experiences these local economic differences \nevery day. This reinforces the need for review of EPA \ndecisions in the SRE applicant\u2019s regional circuit.\nSecond, distributing localized EPA actions among \nthe regional circuits ensures that petitioners get the \nindividualized review that the CAA contemplates. The \nCAA directs EPA to evaluate \u201ca\u201d hardship petition \nbased on whether the particular petitioner would face \n\n5\na \u201cdisproportionate economic hardship\u201d if required to \ncomply with renewable fuel standards. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07545(o)\n(9)(B)(i-ii). It naturally follows that the denial of an SRE \nhardship petition will also get individualized attention in \nthe appropriate court of appeals. But in the joint opening \nbrief in Sinclair Wyoming, CountryMark\u2019s unique \ncircumstances got just two sentences\u2014totaling 60 words. \nAnd CountryMark was not mentioned at all in the joint \nreply brief. CountryMark has a greater opportunity to \ndiscuss its economic hardship in this amicus brief than it \nhad to explain them in Sinclair Wyoming, where it was a \nparty and its own petition was reviewed.\nThird, individual petitioners are more likely to get \nthe timely review required by the CAA if the workload is \ndispersed among the regional circuits. The CAA directs \nEPA to act on an SRE hardship petition within 90 days \nof receipt. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07545(o)(9)(B)(iii). As Respondents \nexplain, EPA ignored that deadline and deprived many \nSRE petitioners of their right to timely review. See \nRespondents Br. 17, 25-26, 39-40 (Jan. 21, 2025). That \ndelay was exacerbated by the consolidation of dozens of \npetitions in the D.C. Circuit. The Fifth Circuit handled \nits petitions for review months before the D.C. Circuit \nadjudicated its bundle of consolidated cases.\nEPA is wrong to assert that venue lies exclusively in \nthe D.C. Circuit for every petitioner seeking appeal of an \nSRE hardship petition ruling. EPA is wrong about the \nfuel market: fuel prices are local and regional rather than \nnational. And EPA is wrong about the process here. Venue \nshould not shift to the D.C. Circuit merely because EPA \nbundled quintessentially local SRE hardship petitions \ntogether.\n\n6\nARGUMENT\n1.\t CountryMark\u2019s local market conditions dictate \nwhether it can meet the federal renewable fuels \nmandate.\nThe individualized nature of SRE hardship petitions \nmakes regional circuits the \u201cappropriate circuit[s]\u201d \nunder the CAA\u2019s venue provision, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07607(b)(1). \nIndiana-based CountryMark\u2019s SRE petitions should be \nreviewed in the Seventh Circuit. Sending them to the \nD.C. Circuit undermines the statutory framework of the \nCAA. This brief focuses on the practical effects that the \nvenue decision has on a small refinery like CountryMark.\nCountryMark is a quintessential small refinery. It \nis a farmer-owned cooperative that was advancing the \nuse of renewable fuels even before it was subject to a \nfederal law mandate. However, it faces disproportionate \neconomic hardship compared to other refineries\u2014even \nother small refineries\u2014because of circumstances specific \nto its ownership and marketplace.\nCountryMark has invested in fuel blending \ninfrastructure that remains capable of blending enough \nrenewable fuels to meet its annual obligation. But despite \nCountryMark\u2019s infrastructure and a customer base that \nembraced renewable fuels early, CountryMark\u2019s customers \nsimply do not want\u2014and thus will not purchase\u2014the \nhigher renewable fuel blends required for CountryMark\u2019s \ncompliance with EPA mandates.\nCustomers select the percentage of renewable fuels to \nbe blended into their gasoline and diesel when they choose \nwhich fuel mix to purchase. The customer\u2019s preferences \n\n7\nin CountryMark\u2019s market are specific to CountryMark \nand are not \u201cnational\u201d in any sense. In CountryMark\u2019s \nmarketplace, demand remains low for higher blends. \nFor example, E85 (a fuel product typically containing \n85% ethanol and 15% gasoline) is not widely accepted by \nCountryMark\u2019s consumers regardless of price because it \nhas less energy per gallon compared to E10 (10% ethanol; \n90% gasoline).2 That low demand is essentially immune \nto price changes. These local retail economics impact \nCountryMark\u2019s ability to sell fuel blends in sufficient \nquantities to achieve CountryMark\u2019s RVO compliance \nlevels.\nCountryMark\u2019s blend percentages are below the \nfederal government\u2019s CAA mandate because of its \ncustomers\u2019 preferences. They purchase less of the \nhigher fuel blends, resulting in CountryMark\u2019s achieving \nlower blending percentages than the mandate requires. \nCountryMark must then purchase RINs (compliance \ncredits) to achieve RFS compliance. The combination \nof mandated RVO increases above CountryMark\u2019s \nmarketplace\u2019s demand, plus increasing RIN prices, makes \ncontinued compliance practically impossible, and SREs \nvital. Without SREs, CountryMark\u2019s long-term viability \nis threatened.\nAnother economic circumstance specific to \nCountryMark is its disproportionate blending of diesel \n2.\u2002 Ethanol, U.S. Dep\u2019t of Energy, https://www.fueleconomy.\ngov/feg/ethanol.shtml (last visited Jan. 27, 2025) (\u201cDue to ethanol\u2019s \nlower energy content, [flex fuel vehicles] operating on E85 get \nroughly 15% to 27% fewer miles per gallon than when operating \non regular gasoline, depending on the ethanol content. Regular \ngasoline typically contains about 10% ethanol.\u201d).\n\n8\nversus gasoline. CountryMark first blended biodiesel \nin 2006, and it is today considered a leader of biodiesel \nblending in Indiana.3 Unsurprisingly, its farmer members \nand their rural customers require more diesel fuel than \ngasoline.\nCountryMark consequently operates its refinery to \nmaximize diesel fuel production to meet the requirements \nof its diesel-centric farmer members and customers. \nBecause of CountryMark\u2019s local customer demand, \nCountryMark sells more diesel fuel through its member \nretail network than it can produce at its refinery, so it must \npurchase diesel from other suppliers to meet customer \ndemand.\nEven though biodiesel helps meet this demand, \ncustomers strongly disfavor it, and therefore buy much \nless of it. This results in a disproportionate economic \nhardship for CountryMark compared to other refiners. \nAnd to preclude all doubt, the Department of Energy \nhas recognized that high diesel production is a criteria \nfor disproportionate economic harm in its small refinery \nexemption study.4 This is exacerbated for CountryMark.\nCountryMark\u2019s customers are integrated with the \nagricultural community, and they are knowledgeable \nusers of renewable fuels\u2014both ethanol and biodiesel. \nImportantly, CountryMark\u2019s customers are aware \n3.\u2002 Meggie Foster, CountryMark Debuts New Brand, Re-\nenergized Vision, Farm World (Jun. 20, 2007), http://www.\nfarmworldonline.com/news/ArchiveArticle.asp?newsid=4377.\n4.\u2002 U.S. Dep\u2019t of Energy, Small Refinery Exemption Study: An \nInvestigation into Disproportionate Economic Hardship 33 (Mar. \n2011), https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-12/documents/\nsmall-refinery-exempt-study.pdf.\n\n9\nthat biodiesel does not work well in cold temperatures, \nfor which Indiana winters are well known. This is an \nacute concern for agricultural consumers because \nthey frequently store diesel fuel on-site, year-round. \nConsequently, CountryMark can sell less than 2% of \nbiodiesel on an annual average basis as a percentage of \nall diesel sales. Contrast this with non-obligated parties \nlike large truck stops who sell to on-road truckers. Truck \nstops can routinely blend 20% biodiesel in their product \nbecause on-road truckers immediately consume the fuel, \nand thus do not have to worry about exposing that diesel \nfuel to the elements in longer-term storage.\nThese local marketplace factors preclude \nCountryMark\u2019s opportunity to blend biodiesel into diesel \nfuel, as compared to blending ethanol into gasoline. \nEven if CountryMark were to try to force a 5% biodiesel \nblend on customers, that would not be enough to meet \nCountryMark\u2019s RFS obligations. Since higher biodiesel \nblends are not as accepted in the market, CountryMark \ndoes not sell as many biodiesel blends at 10% or higher.\nWithout having the ability to sell higher renewable \nblends in diesel fuel, CountryMark is structurally \ndisadvantaged compared to other refineries. By favoring \nthe production of diesel fuel to meet the needs of its \nregional agricultural market, CountryMark does not \nproduce enough gasoline for ethanol blending at any \npercentage that would eliminate the need to purchase \nhigh-priced RINs.\nCountryMark operates in a volatile fuel market and \nits disproportionate economic hardship is structural. \nCountryMark produces more diesel fuel than a typical \n\n10\nrefinery to serve its farmer-owners, and it is located in \nan extremely competitive market with multiple refineries, \npipelines, and terminals. \nAs a result, EPA needs to reevaluate each year whether \nthe exemption should be extended to CountryMark, \njust as Congress directed. When EPA gets the SRE \ndetermination wrong, CountryMark should be heard \nindividually, not bundled with other geographically \ndispersed SRE petitioners. And its statutory venue is the \nSeventh Circuit, its regional court of appeals.\n2.\t CountryMark lost its opportunity for individualized \njudicial review of the denial of its SRE hardship \npetition.\nCountryMark filed a petition for review of EPA\u2019s denial \nof its hardship petition for 2018 in the Seventh Circuit in \nMay 2022.5 In this petition, CountryMark sought to bring \nbefore its regional circuit its unique and local economic \nfactors. Instead of consideration by the Seventh Circuit \nof these CountryMark-centric economics factors, the case \nwas transferred to the D.C. Circuit on EPA\u2019s motion.6\nCountryMark also filed a petition for review of EPA\u2019s \ndenial of its hardship petitions for 2019, 2020, and 2021 \nin the Seventh Circuit in August 2022.7 As with the May \n5.\u2002 See Petition for Review, Countrymark Refin. and Logistics, \nLLC v. EPA, No. 22-1878 (7th Cir. May 18, 2022).\n6.\u2002 See Order Granting EPA\u2019s Motion to Transfer, Countrymark \nRefin. and Logistics, LLC v. EPA, No. 22-1878 (7th Cir. Jul. 20, \n2022); Countrymark Refin. and Logistics, LLC v. EPA, No. 22-\n1165 (D.C. Cir.).\n7.\u2002 See Petition for Review, Countrymark Refin. and Logistics, \nLLC v. EPA, No. 22-2368 (7th Cir. Aug. 3, 2022).\n\n11\npetition for review, the August petition was transferred \nto the D.C. Circuit on EPA\u2019s motion.8 CountryMark\u2019s \npetitions for review were consolidated with 25 other small \nrefineries into an omnibus case in the D.C. Circuit. See \nSinclair Wyoming Refin. Co. LLC, et al. v. EPA, No. 22-\n1073 (D.C. Cir.).\nIn the small refinery petitioners\u2019 joint opening brief \nin Sinclair Wyoming, CountryMark\u2019s unique economic \ncircumstances got two sentences\u2014just 60 words in an \nopening brief of 23,970 words.9 And in the joint reply brief \nthere was no room to mention CountryMark\u2019s specific, \nlocal economics at all.10 Owing to the consolidated nature \nof the case, CountryMark could spend just two sentences \nexplaining why millions of dollars of compliance costs \nunder the RFS created disproportionate hardship for \nCountryMark and threatened its continued financial \nviability.\nIt is hard to see how CountryMark\u2019s appeal could \nreceive the individualized attention it is entitled to \nwithin just 0.025% of the opening brief\u2014and none of \nthe reply. If CountryMark had remained in the Seventh \n8.\u2002 See Order Granting EPA\u2019s Motion to Transfer, Countrymark \nRefin. and Logistics, LLC v. EPA, No. 22-2368 (7th Cir. Sep. 8, \n2022); Countrymark Refin. and Logistics, LLC v. EPA, No. 22-\n1238 (D.C. Cir.).\n9.\u2002 See Final Joint Opening Brief of Petitioner-Appellants at \n17, 81, Sinclair Wyoming Refin. Co. LLC, et al. v. EPA, No. 22-\n1073 (D.C. Cir., Jun. 15, 2023).\n10.\u2002 See generally Final Joint Reply Brief of Petitioner-\nAppellants, Sinclair Wyoming Refin. Co. LLC, et al. v. EPA, No. \n22-1073 (D.C. Cir., Jan. 9, 2024).\n\n12\nCircuit, it would have had 14,000 words in the opening \nbrief\u2014and 7,000 in the reply\u2014to discuss its individual \neconomic reality and its disproportionate hardship \nunder the RFS.11 If CountryMark\u2019s case had remained \nin the Seventh Circuit, it would have had that court\u2019s full \nattention. CountryMark would have been able to explain \nits particular operations, customers, and market factors. \nIts hardships would have been fully and fairly considered \nby judges in CountryMark\u2019s regional circuit, as Congress \nintended.\n3.\t CountryMark lost its opportunity for timely \njudicial review of the denial of its SRE hardship \npetition.\nCongress recognized that the CAA\u2019s fuel mandates \ncould pose an existential threat to smaller refineries, hence \nthe exemption system for refiners facing \u201cdisproportionate \nhardship.\u201d A smaller refinery facing this existential threat \nneeds timely review of its SRE hardship petition. So the \nCAA directs EPA to act on an SRE hardship petition \nwithin 90 days of receipt. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07545(o)(9)(B)(iii). \nNeedless to say, if EPA denies a hardship petition, the \nsmall refinery also needs timely adjudication of its petition \nfor review of that decision; vindication delivered months, \nand in some cases, years, too late is small comfort.\nThe dozens of SRE petitioners, including CountryMark, \nwho were bundled together in the D.C. Circuit in Sinclair \nWyoming filed SRE hardship petitions as early as 2016, \nreceived denials from EPA in April and June 2022, and \nwere given judicial decisions in the D.C. Circuit in July \n11.\u2002 Seventh Circuit Local Rule 32(c).\n\n13\n2024. Sinclair Wyoming Refin. Co. LLC v. EPA, 114 F.4th \n696, 704 (D.C. Cir. 2024). That means that for more than \nhalf of the existence of the renewable fuel mandate, small \nrefineries like CountryMark have operated in regulatory \nuncertainty that threatened their very existence. See 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07545(o)(9)(A)(i) (directing that the renewable \nfuel mandate will apply to small refineries beginning in \n2011). It is true that much of the delay is attributable to \nEPA\u2019s failure to act on the petitions in a timely fashion.12 \nBut not all. \nVenue mattered. The Fifth Circuit declined to transfer \nits petitions to the D.C. Circuit. It resolved both the venue \ndispute and the merits of those petitions eight months \nbefore the D.C. Circuit adjudicated the dozens of petitions \nbundled together in the April and June 2022 denials. See \nCalumet Shreveport Refin., LLC v. EPA, 86 F.4th 1121 \n(5th Cir. 2023). The distributed workload designed by \nCongress is better suited for timely adjudication of SRE \nhardship petitions. Delayed decision-making leads to \ngreater economic uncertainty. Along with the threats of \nincreasing RVOs and rising RIN prices, delay undermines \nCountryMark\u2019s ability to plan for the future and maintain \nits economic viability for its 140,000 farmer-owners and \ntheir customers.\n12.\u2002 Respondents ably explain why EPA should not be allowed \nto use that unlawful delay to turn dozens of local decisions into \none or two \u201cnational\u201d ones. Respondents Br. 17, 25-26, 39-40 (Jan. \n21, 2025).\n\n14\nCONCLUSION\nCountryMark exemplifies the localized challenges \nfaced by small refineries. Its operations are deeply \nembedded in the region within which it operates. These \nunique regional dynamics are best understood and \nadjudicated within CountryMark\u2019s regional circuit.\nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s venue ruling should be upheld to \nensure that EPA\u2019s actions on SRE applicants\u2019 petitions \nare reviewed within the applicants\u2019 regional circuits. \nThis approach respects the individualized nature of SRE \ndeterminations, reinforces s\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n48: 20250128133338281_23-122920Affidavit.json (score: 0.558)\nAFFIDAVIT OF SERVICE \n \nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES \n \nNo. 23-1229 \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------X \nENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY, \nPetitioner, \n \nv. \n \nCALUMET SHREVEPORT REFINING, L.L.C., ET AL., \nRespondents. \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------X \n \nSTATE OF NEW YORK  \n) \n \nCOUNTY OF NEW YORK \n) \n \nI, Julie Connor, being duly sworn according to law and being over the \nage of 18, upon my oath depose and say that: \n \nI am retained by Counsel of Record for Amicus Curiae. \n \nThat on the 28th day of January, 2025, I served the within Brief of \nCountrymark Refining and Logistics, LLC as Amicus Curiae  in Support of \nRespondent in the above-captioned matter upon: \n \nSarah M.

CountryMark is \nowned by more than 140,000 farmers. It is headquartered \nin Indiana.\nCountryMark has a significant interest in this \nappeal because, while small refineries (rightly) prevailed \nin the recent Sinclair Wyoming decision in the D.C. \nCircuit, CountryMark did not get its own day in court \nto specifically and fully address the disproportionate \neconomic hardship that is suffers. CountryMark\u2019s case \nwas improperly consolidated with those of 25 other small \nrefineries. See Sinclair Wyoming Refin. Co. LLC v. EPA, \n101 F.4th 871 (D.C. Cir. 2024). As a result, CountryMark\u2019s \nparticular economic circumstances were mentioned in \njust two sentences in the briefs before the D.C. Circuit. It \nhad no chance to fully and fairly explain how denial of its \nhardship petitions could jeopardize its ability to continue \noperating.\nThe demise of CountryMark would significantly \nharm the rural region in which it operates. CountryMark \nemploys nearly 500 workers, concentrated in the rural \neconomy of southwest Indiana and southeast Illinois. \n1.\u2002 No counsel for a party authored this brief in whole or in \npart. No such counsel or a party made a monetary contribution \nintended to fund the preparation or submission of this brief. No \nperson other than the amicus curiae, its members, or its counsel, \nmade such a monetary contribution.\n\n2\nIn Posey County, Indiana, a county with only 25,000 \nresidents, CountryMark provides over $30 million in \nwages and benefits each year. In 2024, it purchased over \n$800 million of crude oil primarily from the Illinois Basin, \nand those purchases provided income to the 40,000 royalty \nowners in the Illinois Basin. Its products are also sold and \ndistributed through its branded dealer network, providing \nemployment throughout rural communities in its area.\nCountryMark is the only farmer-owned integrated \noil company in the United States, and it is recognized in \nIndiana as a leader in the distribution of biodiesel and \nethanol. Its refinery, which uses 100% American crude \noil, processes 35,000 barrels of crude per day. It supplies \nover 70% of agricultural market fuels and 50% of school \ndistrict fuels in Indiana. Although CountryMark is a \ncritical participant in its regional market, it operates as \na small refinery relative to its peers, with a capacity that \nis merely one-tenth the size of the average refinery in its \nregion.\nCountryMark is precisely the type of small refinery \nCongress envisioned when enacting Small Refinery \nExemptions (\u201cSRE\u201d). For CountryMark, SREs are not \na mechanism to avoid compliance with Congressional \nmandates; rather, they are vital tools to sustain economic \nviability while advancing renewable fuel adoption\u2014an \neffort CountryMark has championed since before such \nmandates existed.\nCountryMark is an Obligated Party under the \nRenewable Fuel Standard (\u201cRFS\u201d). Despite its early \nadoption of renewable fuels, CountryMark\u2019s customers \nare unable or unwilling to blend sufficient renewable \n\n3\nfuels to meet the company\u2019s annual RFS obligations. \nWhile CountryMark has invested significantly in blending \ninfrastructure, the continued escalation of Renewable \nVolume Obligations (\u201cRVOs\u201d), combined with rising \nRenewable Identification Number (\u201cRIN\u201d) prices, renders \ncompliance financially unsustainable without relief \nthrough SREs.\nTo address the economic hardship imposed by the \nRFS, CountryMark has sought SREs under the Clean \nAir Act (\u201cCAA\u201d). By statute, these exemptions must be \ndetermined based on the applicant\u2019s individual economic \ncircumstances. When the Environmental Protection \nAgency (\u201cEPA\u201d) denied CountryMark\u2019s RFS hardship \npetitions, CountryMark sought judicial review in its \nregional circuit. But, on EPA\u2019s motion, the cases were \ntransferred to the D.C. Circuit and consolidated with other \nrefineries\u2019 petitions, denying CountryMark its statutory \nright to review of its particular economic hardships by \nits regional circuit. CountryMark thus has significant \ninterest in this Court\u2019s affirmance of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \ndetermination that the proper venue for review of EPA\u2019s \ndecisions on SRE petitions is the small refinery\u2019s regional \ncircuit.\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\nThe Fifth Circuit correctly determined that the \nproper venue for judicial review of EPA\u2019s decision on \nSRE petitions is the regional circuit of the petitioning \nsmall refinery. The specific economic circumstances of \nthe small refinery and the area in which it operates are \nthe statutorily required and exclusive bases for EPA \ndeterminations of RFS hardship applications. A small \n\n4\nrefinery is almost by definition a local or regional concern. \nSee 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07545(o)(1)(K). Thus, the SRE applicant\u2019s \nregional circuit is best suited to address the application \nand the local economic realities that should underlie EPA\u2019s \ndecision.\nCongress concluded that localized EPA decisions \nshould be reviewed by local jurisdictions. 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a07607(b)(1). That is a rational division of labor for at least \nthree reasons.\nFirst, local jurisdictions are best equipped to render \ndecisions based on local economic realities. Indeed, in \nlarge measure, that is the very purpose of having regional \ncourts of appeals. EPA, along with supporting amici from \ntrade associations that represent non-obligated entities, \nwrongly assume that fuel prices are generally set in the \ncontext of a national market. All states and regions have \ndifferent fuel prices, which are driven by the supply and \ndemand in local markets. Anyone who travels regularly \ncan attest that fuel prices in Indiana, California, and \nLouisiana differ widely\u2014driven by local or regional supply \nand demand. Fuel prices in Posey County in southern \nIndiana are noticeably different from those of Chicago-\nadjacent Lake County, Indiana. CountryMark, which is an \nObligated Party, operates wholesale terminals in several \nmarkets and experiences these local economic differences \nevery day. This reinforces the need for review of EPA \ndecisions in the SRE applicant\u2019s regional circuit.\nSecond, distributing localized EPA actions among \nthe regional circuits ensures that petitioners get the \nindividualized review that the CAA contemplates. The \nCAA directs EPA to evaluate \u201ca\u201d hardship petition \nbased on whether the particular petitioner would face \n\n5\na \u201cdisproportionate economic hardship\u201d if required to \ncomply with renewable fuel standards. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07545(o)\n(9)(B)(i-ii). It naturally follows that the denial of an SRE \nhardship petition will also get individualized attention in \nthe appropriate court of appeals. But in the joint opening \nbrief in Sinclair Wyoming, CountryMark\u2019s unique \ncircumstances got just two sentences\u2014totaling 60 words. \nAnd CountryMark was not mentioned at all in the joint \nreply brief. CountryMark has a greater opportunity to \ndiscuss its economic hardship in this amicus brief than it \nhad to explain them in Sinclair Wyoming, where it was a \nparty and its own petition was reviewed.\nThird, individual petitioners are more likely to get \nthe timely review required by the CAA if the workload is \ndispersed among the regional circuits. The CAA directs \nEPA to act on an SRE hardship petition within 90 days \nof receipt. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07545(o)(9)(B)(iii). As Respondents \nexplain, EPA ignored that deadline and deprived many \nSRE petitioners of their right to timely review. See \nRespondents Br. 17, 25-26, 39-40 (Jan. 21, 2025). That \ndelay was exacerbated by the consolidation of dozens of \npetitions in the D.C. Circuit. The Fifth Circuit handled \nits petitions for review months before the D.C. Circuit \nadjudicated its bundle of consolidated cases.\nEPA is wrong to assert that venue lies exclusively in \nthe D.C. Circuit for every petitioner seeking appeal of an \nSRE hardship petition ruling. EPA is wrong about the \nfuel market: fuel prices are local and regional rather than \nnational. And EPA is wrong about the process here. Venue \nshould not shift to the D.C. Circuit merely because EPA \nbundled quintessentially local SRE hardship petitions \ntogether.\n\n6\nARGUMENT\n1.\t CountryMark\u2019s local market conditions dictate \nwhether it can meet the federal renewable fuels \nmandate.\nThe individualized nature of SRE hardship petitions \nmakes regional circuits the \u201cappropriate circuit[s]\u201d \nunder the CAA\u2019s venue provision, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07607(b)(1). \nIndiana-based CountryMark\u2019s SRE petitions should be \nreviewed in the Seventh Circuit. Sending them to the \nD.C. Circuit undermines the statutory framework of the \nCAA. This brief focuses on the practical effects that the \nvenue decision has on a small refinery like CountryMark.\nCountryMark is a quintessential small refinery. It \nis a farmer-owned cooperative that was advancing the \nuse of renewable fuels even before it was subject to a \nfederal law mandate. However, it faces disproportionate \neconomic hardship compared to other refineries\u2014even \nother small refineries\u2014because of circumstances specific \nto its ownership and marketplace.\nCountryMark has invested in fuel blending \ninfrastructure that remains capable of blending enough \nrenewable fuels to meet its annual obligation. But despite \nCountryMark\u2019s infrastructure and a customer base that \nembraced renewable fuels early, CountryMark\u2019s customers \nsimply do not want\u2014and thus will not purchase\u2014the \nhigher renewable fuel blends required for CountryMark\u2019s \ncompliance with EPA mandates.\nCustomers select the percentage of renewable fuels to \nbe blended into their gasoline and diesel when they choose \nwhich fuel mix to purchase. The customer\u2019s preferences \n\n7\nin CountryMark\u2019s market are specific to CountryMark \nand are not \u201cnational\u201d in any sense. In CountryMark\u2019s \nmarketplace, demand remains low for higher blends. \nFor example, E85 (a fuel product typically containing \n85% ethanol and 15% gasoline) is not widely accepted by \nCountryMark\u2019s consumers regardless of price because it \nhas less energy per gallon compared to E10 (10% ethanol; \n90% gasoline).2 That low demand is essentially immune \nto price changes. These local retail economics impact \nCountryMark\u2019s ability to sell fuel blends in sufficient \nquantities to achieve CountryMark\u2019s RVO compliance \nlevels.\nCountryMark\u2019s blend percentages are below the \nfederal government\u2019s CAA mandate because of its \ncustomers\u2019 preferences. They purchase less of the \nhigher fuel blends, resulting in CountryMark\u2019s achieving \nlower blending percentages than the mandate requires. \nCountryMark must then purchase RINs (compliance \ncredits) to achieve RFS compliance. The combination \nof mandated RVO increases above CountryMark\u2019s \nmarketplace\u2019s demand, plus increasing RIN prices, makes \ncontinued compliance practically impossible, and SREs \nvital. Without SREs, CountryMark\u2019s long-term viability \nis threatened.\nAnother economic circumstance specific to \nCountryMark is its disproportionate blending of diesel \n2.\u2002 Ethanol, U.S. Dep\u2019t of Energy, https://www.fueleconomy.\ngov/feg/ethanol.shtml (last visited Jan. 27, 2025) (\u201cDue to ethanol\u2019s \nlower energy content, [flex fuel vehicles] operating on E85 get \nroughly 15% to 27% fewer miles per gallon than when operating \non regular gasoline, depending on the ethanol content. Regular \ngasoline typically contains about 10% ethanol.\u201d).\n\n8\nversus gasoline. CountryMark first blended biodiesel \nin 2006, and it is today considered a leader of biodiesel \nblending in Indiana.3 Unsurprisingly, its farmer members \nand their rural customers require more diesel fuel than \ngasoline.\nCountryMark consequently operates its refinery to \nmaximize diesel fuel production to meet the requirements \nof its diesel-centric farmer members and customers. \nBecause of CountryMark\u2019s local customer demand, \nCountryMark sells more diesel fuel through its member \nretail network than it can produce at its refinery, so it must \npurchase diesel from other suppliers to meet customer \ndemand.\nEven though biodiesel helps meet this demand, \ncustomers strongly disfavor it, and therefore buy much \nless of it. This results in a disproportionate economic \nhardship for CountryMark compared to other refiners. \nAnd to preclude all doubt, the Department of Energy \nhas recognized that high diesel production is a criteria \nfor disproportionate economic harm in its small refinery \nexemption study.4 This is exacerbated for CountryMark.\nCountryMark\u2019s customers are integrated with the \nagricultural community, and they are knowledgeable \nusers of renewable fuels\u2014both ethanol and biodiesel. \nImportantly, CountryMark\u2019s customers are aware \n3.\u2002 Meggie Foster, CountryMark Debuts New Brand, Re-\nenergized Vision, Farm World (Jun. 20, 2007), http://www.\nfarmworldonline.com/news/ArchiveArticle.asp?newsid=4377.\n4.\u2002 U.S. Dep\u2019t of Energy, Small Refinery Exemption Study: An \nInvestigation into Disproportionate Economic Hardship 33 (Mar. \n2011), https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-12/documents/\nsmall-refinery-exempt-study.pdf.\n\n9\nthat biodiesel does not work well in cold temperatures, \nfor which Indiana winters are well known. This is an \nacute concern for agricultural consumers because \nthey frequently store diesel fuel on-site, year-round. \nConsequently, CountryMark can sell less than 2% of \nbiodiesel on an annual average basis as a percentage of \nall diesel sales. Contrast this with non-obligated parties \nlike large truck stops who sell to on-road truckers. Truck \nstops can routinely blend 20% biodiesel in their product \nbecause on-road truckers immediately consume the fuel, \nand thus do not have to worry about exposing that diesel \nfuel to the elements in longer-term storage.\nThese local marketplace factors preclude \nCountryMark\u2019s opportunity to blend biodiesel into diesel \nfuel, as compared to blending ethanol into gasoline. \nEven if CountryMark were to try to force a 5% biodiesel \nblend on customers, that would not be enough to meet \nCountryMark\u2019s RFS obligations. Since higher biodiesel \nblends are not as accepted in the market, CountryMark \ndoes not sell as many biodiesel blends at 10% or higher.\nWithout having the ability to sell higher renewable \nblends in diesel fuel, CountryMark is structurally \ndisadvantaged compared to other refineries. By favoring \nthe production of diesel fuel to meet the needs of its \nregional agricultural market, CountryMark does not \nproduce enough gasoline for ethanol blending at any \npercentage that would eliminate the need to purchase \nhigh-priced RINs.\nCountryMark operates in a volatile fuel market and \nits disproportionate economic hardship is structural. \nCountryMark produces more diesel fuel than a typical \n\n10\nrefinery to serve its farmer-owners, and it is located in \nan extremely competitive market with multiple refineries, \npipelines, and terminals. \nAs a result, EPA needs to reevaluate each year whether \nthe exemption should be extended to CountryMark, \njust as Congress directed. When EPA gets the SRE \ndetermination wrong, CountryMark should be heard \nindividually, not bundled with other geographically \ndispersed SRE petitioners. And its statutory venue is the \nSeventh Circuit, its regional court of appeals.\n2.\t CountryMark lost its opportunity for individualized \njudicial review of the denial of its SRE hardship \npetition.\nCountryMark filed a petition for review of EPA\u2019s denial \nof its hardship petition for 2018 in the Seventh Circuit in \nMay 2022.5 In this petition, CountryMark sought to bring \nbefore its regional circuit its unique and local economic \nfactors. Instead of consideration by the Seventh Circuit \nof these CountryMark-centric economics factors, the case \nwas transferred to the D.C. Circuit on EPA\u2019s motion.6\nCountryMark also filed a petition for review of EPA\u2019s \ndenial of its hardship petitions for 2019, 2020, and 2021 \nin the Seventh Circuit in August 2022.7 As with the May \n5.\u2002 See Petition for Review, Countrymark Refin. and Logistics, \nLLC v.

Cir.).\nIn the small refinery petitioners\u2019 joint opening brief \nin Sinclair Wyoming, CountryMark\u2019s unique economic \ncircumstances got two sentences\u2014just 60 words in an \nopening brief of 23,970 words.9 And in the joint reply brief \nthere was no room to mention CountryMark\u2019s specific, \nlocal economics at all.10 Owing to the consolidated nature \nof the case, CountryMark could spend just two sentences \nexplaining why millions of dollars of compliance costs \nunder the RFS created disproportionate hardship for \nCountryMark and threatened its continued financial \nviability.\nIt is hard to see how CountryMark\u2019s appeal could \nreceive the individualized attention it is entitled to \nwithin just 0.025% of the opening brief\u2014and none of \nthe reply. If CountryMark had remained in the Seventh \n8.\u2002 See Order Granting EPA\u2019s Motion to Transfer, Countrymark \nRefin. and Logistics, LLC v. EPA, No. 22-2368 (7th Cir. Sep. 8, \n2022); Countrymark Refin. and Logistics, LLC v. EPA, No. 22-\n1238 (D.C. Cir.).\n9.\u2002 See Final Joint Opening Brief of Petitioner-Appellants at \n17, 81, Sinclair Wyoming Refin. Co. LLC, et al. v. EPA, No. 22-\n1073 (D.C. Cir., Jun. 15, 2023).\n10.\u2002 See generally Final Joint Reply Brief of Petitioner-\nAppellants, Sinclair Wyoming Refin. Co. LLC, et al. v. EPA, No. \n22-1073 (D.C. Cir., Jan. 9, 2024).\n\n12\nCircuit, it would have had 14,000 words in the opening \nbrief\u2014and 7,000 in the reply\u2014to discuss its individual \neconomic reality and its disproportionate hardship \nunder the RFS.11 If CountryMark\u2019s case had remained \nin the Seventh Circuit, it would have had that court\u2019s full \nattention. CountryMark would have been able to explain \nits particular operations, customers, and market factors. \nIts hardships would have been fully and fairly considered \nby judges in CountryMark\u2019s regional circuit, as Congress \nintended.\n3.\t CountryMark lost its opportunity for timely \njudicial review of the denial of its SRE hardship \npetition.\nCongress recognized that the CAA\u2019s fuel mandates \ncould pose an existential threat to smaller refineries, hence \nthe exemption system for refiners facing \u201cdisproportionate \nhardship.\u201d A smaller refinery facing this existential threat \nneeds timely review of its SRE hardship petition. So the \nCAA directs EPA to act on an SRE hardship petition \nwithin 90 days of receipt. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07545(o)(9)(B)(iii). \nNeedless to say, if EPA denies a hardship petition, the \nsmall refinery also needs timely adjudication of its petition \nfor review of that decision; vindication delivered months, \nand in some cases, years, too late is small comfort.\nThe dozens of SRE petitioners, including CountryMark, \nwho were bundled together in the D.C. Circuit in Sinclair \nWyoming filed SRE hardship petitions as early as 2016, \nreceived denials from EPA in April and June 2022, and \nwere given judicial decisions in the D.C. Circuit in July \n11.\u2002 Seventh Circuit Local Rule 32(c).\n\n13\n2024. Sinclair Wyoming Refin. Co. LLC v. EPA, 114 F.4th \n696, 704 (D.C. Cir. 2024). That means that for more than \nhalf of the existence of the renewable fuel mandate, small \nrefineries like CountryMark have operated in regulatory \nuncertainty that threatened their very existence. See 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07545(o)(9)(A)(i) (directing that the renewable \nfuel mandate will apply to small refineries beginning in \n2011). It is true that much of the delay is attributable to \nEPA\u2019s failure to act on the petitions in a timely fashion.12 \nBut not all. \nVenue mattered. The Fifth Circuit declined to transfer \nits petitions to the D.C. Circuit. It resolved both the venue \ndispute and the merits of those petitions eight months \nbefore the D.C. Circuit adjudicated the dozens of petitions \nbundled together in the April and June 2022 denials. See \nCalumet Shreveport Refin., LLC v. EPA, 86 F.4th 1121 \n(5th Cir. 2023). The distributed workload designed by \nCongress is better suited for timely adjudication of SRE \nhardship petitions. Delayed decision-making leads to \ngreater economic uncertainty. Along with the threats of \nincreasing RVOs and rising RIN prices, delay undermines \nCountryMark\u2019s ability to plan for the future and maintain \nits economic viability for its 140,000 farmer-owners and \ntheir customers.\n12.\u2002 Respondents ably explain why EPA should not be allowed \nto use that unlawful delay to turn dozens of local decisions into \none or two \u201cnational\u201d ones. Respondents Br. 17, 25-26, 39-40 (Jan. \n21, 2025).\n\n14\nCONCLUSION\nCountryMark exemplifies the localized challenges \nfaced by small refineries. Its operations are deeply \nembedded in the region within which it operates. These \nunique regional dynamics are best understood and \nadjudicated within CountryMark\u2019s regional circuit.\nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s venue ruling should be upheld to \nensure that EPA\u2019s actions on SRE applicants\u2019 petitions \nare reviewed within the applicants\u2019 regional circuits. \nThis approach respects the individualized nature of SRE \ndeterminations, reinforces statutory compliance, and \npreserves the rights of small refineries like CountryMark \nto operate within a fair and sustainable regulatory \nframework.\nRespectfully submitted,\nJanuary 28, 2025\nAaron M.

Six of those refineries petitioned \nfor review of EPA\u2019s decisions in the Fifth Circuit, which \ndenied the government\u2019s motion to transfer the peti-\ntions to the D.C. Circuit.  The question presented is as \nfollows: \nWhether venue for the refineries\u2019 challenges lies ex-\nclusively in the D.C. Circuit because the denial actions \nare \u201cnationally applicable\u201d or, alternatively, are \u201cbased \non a determination of nationwide scope or effect.\u201d  42 \nU.S.C. 7607(b)(1). \n \n \n\n(III) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage\nOpinion below ................................................................................ 1 \nJurisdiction .................................................................................... 1 \nStatutory provisions involved ...................................................... 1 \nStatement: \nA. \nLegal background ............................................................ 2 \nB. \nFacts and proceedings below ......................................... 6 \nSummary of argument ............................................................... 14 \nArgument: \nThe D.C.

App. 1a-43a) \nis reported at 86 F.4th 1121. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nNovember 22, 2023.  Petitions for rehearing were de-\nnied on January 22, 2024 (Pet. App. 331a-333a).  On April \n11, 2024, Justice Alito extended the time within which \nto file a petition for a writ of certiorari to and including \nMay 21, 2024.  The petition for a writ of certiorari was \nfiled on May 20, 2024, and was granted on October 21, \n2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court rests on 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent statutory provisions are reprinted in the \nappendix.  App., infra, 1a-32a. \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal Background \n1. When a petitioner seeks review of a \u201cfinal action\u201d \ntaken by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \nunder the Clean Air Act (CAA), 42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq., \nSection 7607(b)(1) of Title 42 provides for direct court \nof appeals review of the petitioner\u2019s challenge.  To de-\ntermine which circuit has exclusive venue over the chal-\nlenge, Section 7607(b)(1) separates EPA\u2019s final actions \ninto three categories.  First, challenges to certain spec-\nified actions or to \u201cany other nationally applicable reg-\nulations promulgated, or final action taken,\u201d must be \nfiled \u201conly in the United States Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  Second, \nchallenges to actions that are \u201clocally or regionally ap-\nplicable may be filed only in the United States Court of \nAppeals for the appropriate circuit.\u201d  Ibid.  Third, \n\u201c[n]otwithstanding\u201d the sentence directing review of lo-\ncally or regionally applicable actions to \u201cthe appropri-\nate circuit,\u201d challenges to such locally or regionally ap-\nplicable actions \u201cmay be filed only in the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia if such ac-\ntion is based on a determination of nationwide scope or \neffect and if in taking such action the Administrator \nfinds and publishes that such action is based on such a \ndetermination.\u201d  Ibid.   \nCongress adopted this three-prong structure in \n1977.  See Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977, Pub. L. \nNo. 95, 91 Stat. 776.  The predecessor to Section \n7607(b)(1) had provided for direct court of appeals re-\nview only of certain specifically enumerated EPA ac-\ntions.  42 U.S.C. 1857h-5(b)(1) (1970).  EPA actions in-\nvolving \u201cnational primary or secondary ambient air \nquality standard[s],\u201d \u201cemission standard[s],\u201d or other \n\n3 \n \nspecified standards or controls were reviewable only in \nthe D.C. Circuit, while EPA\u2019s actions \u201cin approving or \npromulgating\u201d a state or federal \u201cimplementation plan\u201d \nwere reviewable only in \u201cthe appropriate circuit.\u201d  Ibid.  \nThat division reflected Congress\u2019s view that EPA ac-\ntions that are \u201cnational in scope\u201d should receive \u201ceven \nand consistent national application,\u201d which would be ac-\ncomplished through centralized D.C. Circuit review.   \nS. Rep. No. 1196, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 41 (1970) (1970 \nSenate Report).  By contrast, Congress viewed EPA ac-\ntions approving or promulgating \u201cimplementation plans \nwhich run only to one air quality control region\u201d as ap-\npropriately reviewed \u201cin the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Circuit in which the affected air quality control re-\ngion, or portion thereof, is located.\u201d  Ibid.  At that time, \nthe venue provision did not include a catchall for other \nnationally or locally or regionally applicable actions, nor \ndid the provision specifically reference EPA actions \nthat are based on a determination of nationwide scope \nor effect.  Rather, final actions that the CAA venue pro-\nvision did not specifically address were reviewable only \nby a district court exercising federal-question jurisdic-\ntion.  See Harrison v. PPG Industries, Inc., 446 U.S. \n578, 584 (1980).   \nIn 1977, Congress amended the statute to authorize \ndirect court of appeals review of all EPA \u201cfinal actions\u201d \nunder the CAA.  Congress achieved that result by add-\ning the catchall categories for the first two subsets of \nfinal actions, and by adding the third category of locally \nor regionally applicable actions that are based on a de-\ntermination of nationwide scope or effect.  The House \nReport accompanying the amendment explained that \nthe revision would \u201cprovide[] for essentially locally, \nstatewide, or regionally applicable rules or orders to be \n\n4 \n \nreviewed in the U.S. court of appeals for the circuit in \nwhich such locality, State, or region is located.\u201d  H.R. \nRep. No. 294, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 323 (1977) (1977 \nHouse Report).  \u201cOn the other hand,\u201d the report ex-\nplained, venue would lie only in the D.C. Circuit \u201cif an \naction of the Administrator is found by him to be based \non a determination of nationwide scope or effect (includ-\ning a determination which has scope or effect beyond a \nsingle judicial circuit).\u201d  Id. at 324.   \n2. The EPA actions at issue in this case involve the \nRenewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program, a CAA pro-\ngram that generally requires transportation fuel sold or \nintroduced into commerce in the United States to con-\ntain specified volumes of renewable fuel.  See 42 U.S.C. \n7545(o)(2)(A)(i) and (B)(i).  To implement the program, \nEPA expresses renewable-fuel targets as a percentage \nof the gasoline and diesel fuel that is projected to be sold \nin the upcoming year, and the agency adopts regulations \nto ensure compliance.  See 42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(2)(A)(i); see \nalso 42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(3).  Obligated parties \u201cuse that \nannual-percentage standard to determine their volume \nobligations\u201d for the year.  Pet. App. 3a.  Each obligated \nparty\u2019s renewable-fuel-volume obligation is propor-\ntional to its annual production or importation of gaso-\nline and diesel fuel.   \nEPA\u2019s implementing regulations identify refineries \nand importers of gasoline and diesel as obligated parties \nsubject to RFS requirements.  40 C.F.R. 80.2, 80.1406.  \nTo track whether an obligated party has satisfied RFS \nprogram requirements, EPA uses a credit system that \noffers parties flexibility in achieving compliance.  See 42 \nU.S.C. 7545(o)(5).  Producers and importers of renewa-\nble fuels generate credits\u2014called Renewable Identifi-\ncation Numbers (RINs)\u2014for each gallon of renewable \n\n5 \n \nfuel they produce or import for use in the United States.  \n40 C.F.R. 80.1426(a).  The producers and importers as-\nsign a RIN to each batch of renewable fuel.  40 C.F.R. \n80.1426(e).  A RIN may be used after it is \u201cseparated\u201d \nfrom its batch by an obligated party or by an entity that \nblends the renewable fuel into gasoline or diesel.  40 \nC.F.R. 80.1429(b).  Once separated, RINs may be kept \nfor compliance or sold.  40 C.F.R. 80.1425-80.1429.  Each \nyear, a refinery may generate its own credits by blend-\ning renewable fuel into transportation fuel, or it may \npurchase the requisite number of credits.  See Pet. App. \n206a-207a; see also 42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(5)(B) and (E); 40 \nC.F.R. 80.1428(b), 80.1429(b). \nObligated parties meet their renewable-fuel-volume \nobligations by \u201cretir[ing]\u201d RINs in an annual compli-\nance demonstration.  40 C.F.R. 80.1427(a)(1).  A refin-\nery may use a particular RIN only during the calendar \nyear in which it was generated or in the following calen-\ndar year.  40 C.F.R. 80.1427(a)(6), 80.1428(c).  An obli-\ngated party who fails to demonstrate full compliance in \none year may carry forward a compliance deficit to the \nfollowing year.  42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(5)(D).  \nCongress created a three-tiered scheme through \nwhich obligated parties that qualify as \u201c[s]mall refiner-\nies\u201d may obtain exemptions from RFS program require-\nments.  42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9) (emphasis omitted); see 42 \nU.S.C. 7545(o)(1)(k) (defining \u201csmall refinery\u201d).   \nFirst, Congress granted all small refineries a blan-\nket exemption until 2011.  42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(A)(i). \nSecond, Congress directed the U.S. Department of \nEnergy (DOE) to study \u201cwhether compliance with the \nrequirements of [the RFS program] would impose a dis-\nproportionate economic hardship on small refineries.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(A)(ii)(I).  For any small refinery \n\n6 \n \nthat DOE determined \u201cwould be subject to a dispropor-\ntionate economic hardship if required to comply,\u201d Con-\ngress directed EPA to extend the exemption for at least \ntwo years.  42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(A)(ii)(II). \nThird, Congress established a mechanism through \nwhich a small refinery \u201cmay at any time petition [EPA] \nfor an extension of the exemption under subparagraph \n(A) for the reason of disproportionate economic hard-\nship.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(B)(i).  In evaluating a peti-\ntion for such an exemption, EPA, \u201cin consultation with\u201d \nDOE, \u201cshall consider the findings of [DOE\u2019s study] and \nother economic factors.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(B)(ii). \nB. Facts And Proceedings Below \n1. In August 2019, EPA issued a single decision act-\ning on 36 exemption petitions filed by small refineries \nfor the 2018 compliance year, granting 31 petitions and \ndenying five.  See C.A. App. 2928.  Multiple parties pe-\ntitioned for review of the action in the D.C. Circuit.  See \nSinclair Wyoming Ref. Co. v. EPA, No. 19-1196; Big \nWest Oil, LLC v. EPA, No. 19-1197; Renewable Fuels \nAss\u2019n v. EPA, No. 19-1220; Kern Oil & Ref. Co. v. EPA, \nNo. 19-1216; Wynnewood Ref. Co. v. EPA, No. 20-1099.   \nWhile those challenges were pending, the Tenth Cir-\ncuit issued a decision vacating and remanding three \nEPA orders granting three exemption petitions for the \n2016 and 2017 compliance years.  Renewable Fuels Ass\u2019n \nv. EPA, 948 F.3d 1206, 1258 (2020).  The court held that \na small refinery is eligible for an extension of an exemp-\ntion only if it has maintained a continuous, uninter-\nrupted exemption, id. at 1245-1249; that \u201crenewable \nfuels compliance must be the cause of any dispropor-\ntionate hardship\u201d in order for an exemption to be avail-\nable, id. at 1253; and that EPA had \u201c\u200a\u2018failed to consider \nan important aspect of the problem\u2019\u200a\u201d when it did not ad-\n\n7 \n \ndress whether refiners could \u201cpass RIN costs on to cus-\ntomers,\u201d id. at 1257 (citation omitted).  This Court \ngranted a petition for a writ of certiorari limited to the \nfirst of those Tenth Circuit holdings.  HollyFrontier \nCheyenne Ref., LLC v. Renewable Fuels Ass\u2019n, 141  \nS. Ct. 974 (2021).  Pending this Court\u2019s resolution of \nHollyFrontier, the D.C. Circuit granted EPA\u2019s motion \nto hold in abeyance the petitions for review that had \nbeen filed in that court. See Sinclair Wyoming Ref. Co. \nv. EPA, No. 19-1196, Doc. 1883334 (Feb. 2, 2021); p. 6, \nsupra.   \nThis Court reversed the Tenth Circuit decision in \nHollyFrontier, holding that a small refinery may be el-\nigible for an exemption renewal even if the refinery had \nallowed a prior exemption to lapse.  HollyFrontier \nCheyenne Ref., LLC v. Renewable Fuels Ass\u2019n, 594 U.S. \n382, 390 (2021).  In the pending D.C. Circuit proceed-\nings, EPA then moved for a voluntary remand without \nvacatur to allow the agency to reconsider its action on \nthe 2018 exemption petitions in light of this Court\u2019s de-\ncision in HollyFrontier, and in light of the Tenth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s analysis in Renewable Fuels Association of addi-\ntional issues this Court had not reached.  See Sinclair \nWyoming Ref. Co., No. 19-1196, Doc. 1911606 (Aug. 25, \n2021).  The D.C. Circuit granted that motion and in-\nstructed EPA to act on the petitions within 120 days.  \nSinclair Wyoming Ref. Co., No. 19-1196, Doc. 1925942 \n(Dec. 8, 2021).   \n2. In December 2021, EPA proposed to deny all \npending small refinery exemption petitions.  86 Fed. \nReg. 70,999 (Dec. 14, 2021); see C.A. App. 520-585.  \nSeeking to create a nationally uniform program, EPA \nproposed to adopt the Tenth Circuit\u2019s reasoning in Re-\nnewable Fuels Association on the issues this Court had \n\n8 \n \nnot considered.  Under that approach, EPA proposed to \ninterpret the pertinent statutory provisions as requir-\ning small refineries seeking exemptions to show that \nRFS compliance itself caused a disproportionate eco-\nnomic hardship.  C.A. App. 545-548.  In accordance with \nthe Tenth Circuit\u2019s analysis, EPA also analyzed whether \nrefineries were able to pass on the costs of RFS compli-\nance to consumers.  The agency concluded that the evi-\ndence supported a rebuttable presumption that such \ncosts \u201care fully passed through to consumers,\u201d so that \nsmall refineries ordinarily would not suffer dispropor-\ntionate economic hardship as a result of RFS compli-\nance.  Id. at 549; see id. at 548-584.  In light of those \nconclusions, EPA proposed to deny all the pending ex-\nemption petitions and sought comment on that pro-\nposed decision.   \nAfter the comment period ended, EPA took two ac-\ntions.  In April 2022\u2014the deadline set by the D.C. Cir-\ncuit to resolve the remanded petitions\u2014EPA denied 36 \nexemption petitions filed by small refineries for the \n2018 compliance year.  Pet. App. 193a; see April 2022 \nDenial of Petitions for Small Refinery Exemptions \nUnder the Renewable Fuel Standard Program, 87 Fed. \nReg. 24,300 (Apr. 25, 2022) (April Notice).  In June \n2022, EPA denied an additional 69 petitions for the \n2016-2021 compliance years.  Pet. App. 48a; see Notice \nof June 2022 Denial of Petitions for Small Refinery Ex-\nemptions Under the Renewable Fuel Standard Pro-\ngram, 87 Fed. Reg. 34,873, 34,874 (June 8, 2022) (June \nNotice).  The two denial actions reflect the same reason-\ning and are based on two principal rationales, one stat-\nutory and one economic.1  The denial actions contain ex-\n \n1  For ease of reference, this brief cites only the April 2022 denial \nwhen discussing reasoning common to both actions. \n\n9 \n \nplicit agency findings that the actions are nationally ap-\nplicable or, in the alternative, that they are based on de-\nterminations of nationwide scope or effect. \nStatutory interpretation.  In the April and June 2022 \ndenial actions, EPA concluded that an extension of the \nsmall refinery exemption under the relevant provisions \nmay be granted only if disproportionate economic hard-\nship was \u201ccaused by RFS compliance.\u201d  Pet. App. 242a.  \nFor relevant context, the agency turned to paragraph \n(A) of 42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9), which established the initial \nblanket exemption for small refineries and the two-year \nextension based on the DOE study.  See 42 U.S.C. \n7545(o)(9)(A) and (B).  The agency observed that para-\ngraph (A) focuses on \u201cwhether compliance with the re-\nquirements of [the RFS program] would impose a [dis-\nproportionate economic hardship] on small refineries.\u201d  \nPet. App. 243a (quoting 42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(A)(ii)(I)).  \nBecause paragraph (B) provides for an extension of the \nexemption provided by paragraph (A), EPA construed \nparagraph (B)\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n15: 20241213185250767_Certificate20-2023-122920-20EPA20v.20Calumet20Shreveport20Refining20LLC.json (score: 0.505)\nNo. 23-1229 \n \n \nIN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES \n _________________ \n \nENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY, PETITIONER \n \nv. \n \nCALUMET SHREVEPORT REFINING, L.L.C., ET AL. \n_________________ \n \n \n \n \nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE \n \n \nIt is hereby certified that all parties required to be served have been served with copies of the \nBRIEF FOR THE PETITIONER, via email and first-class mail, postage prepaid, this 13th day of \nDecember 2024. \n \n[See Attached Service List] \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs required by Supreme Court Rule 33.1(h), I certify that the document contains 12,158 words, \nexcluding the parts of the document that are exempted by Supreme Court Rule 33.1(d).

Six of those refineries petitioned \nfor review of EPA\u2019s decisions in the Fifth Circuit, which \ndenied the government\u2019s motion to transfer the peti-\ntions to the D.C. Circuit.  The question presented is as \nfollows: \nWhether venue for the refineries\u2019 challenges lies ex-\nclusively in the D.C. Circuit because the denial actions \nare \u201cnationally applicable\u201d or, alternatively, are \u201cbased \non a determination of nationwide scope or effect.\u201d  42 \nU.S.C. 7607(b)(1). \n \n \n\n(III) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage\nOpinion below ................................................................................ 1 \nJurisdiction .................................................................................... 1 \nStatutory provisions involved ...................................................... 1 \nStatement: \nA. \nLegal background ............................................................ 2 \nB. \nFacts and proceedings below ......................................... 6 \nSummary of argument ............................................................... 14 \nArgument: \nThe D.C.

App. 1a-43a) \nis reported at 86 F.4th 1121. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nNovember 22, 2023.  Petitions for rehearing were de-\nnied on January 22, 2024 (Pet. App. 331a-333a).  On April \n11, 2024, Justice Alito extended the time within which \nto file a petition for a writ of certiorari to and including \nMay 21, 2024.  The petition for a writ of certiorari was \nfiled on May 20, 2024, and was granted on October 21, \n2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court rests on 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent statutory provisions are reprinted in the \nappendix.  App., infra, 1a-32a. \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal Background \n1. When a petitioner seeks review of a \u201cfinal action\u201d \ntaken by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \nunder the Clean Air Act (CAA), 42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq., \nSection 7607(b)(1) of Title 42 provides for direct court \nof appeals review of the petitioner\u2019s challenge.  To de-\ntermine which circuit has exclusive venue over the chal-\nlenge, Section 7607(b)(1) separates EPA\u2019s final actions \ninto three categories.  First, challenges to certain spec-\nified actions or to \u201cany other nationally applicable reg-\nulations promulgated, or final action taken,\u201d must be \nfiled \u201conly in the United States Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  Second, \nchallenges to actions that are \u201clocally or regionally ap-\nplicable may be filed only in the United States Court of \nAppeals for the appropriate circuit.\u201d  Ibid.  Third, \n\u201c[n]otwithstanding\u201d the sentence directing review of lo-\ncally or regionally applicable actions to \u201cthe appropri-\nate circuit,\u201d challenges to such locally or regionally ap-\nplicable actions \u201cmay be filed only in the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia if such ac-\ntion is based on a determination of nationwide scope or \neffect and if in taking such action the Administrator \nfinds and publishes that such action is based on such a \ndetermination.\u201d  Ibid.   \nCongress adopted this three-prong structure in \n1977.  See Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977, Pub. L. \nNo. 95, 91 Stat. 776.  The predecessor to Section \n7607(b)(1) had provided for direct court of appeals re-\nview only of certain specifically enumerated EPA ac-\ntions.  42 U.S.C. 1857h-5(b)(1) (1970).  EPA actions in-\nvolving \u201cnational primary or secondary ambient air \nquality standard[s],\u201d \u201cemission standard[s],\u201d or other \n\n3 \n \nspecified standards or controls were reviewable only in \nthe D.C. Circuit, while EPA\u2019s actions \u201cin approving or \npromulgating\u201d a state or federal \u201cimplementation plan\u201d \nwere reviewable only in \u201cthe appropriate circuit.\u201d  Ibid.  \nThat division reflected Congress\u2019s view that EPA ac-\ntions that are \u201cnational in scope\u201d should receive \u201ceven \nand consistent national application,\u201d which would be ac-\ncomplished through centralized D.C. Circuit review.   \nS. Rep. No. 1196, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 41 (1970) (1970 \nSenate Report).  By contrast, Congress viewed EPA ac-\ntions approving or promulgating \u201cimplementation plans \nwhich run only to one air quality control region\u201d as ap-\npropriately reviewed \u201cin the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Circuit in which the affected air quality control re-\ngion, or portion thereof, is located.\u201d  Ibid.  At that time, \nthe venue provision did not include a catchall for other \nnationally or locally or regionally applicable actions, nor \ndid the provision specifically reference EPA actions \nthat are based on a determination of nationwide scope \nor effect.  Rather, final actions that the CAA venue pro-\nvision did not specifically address were reviewable only \nby a district court exercising federal-question jurisdic-\ntion.  See Harrison v. PPG Industries, Inc., 446 U.S. \n578, 584 (1980).   \nIn 1977, Congress amended the statute to authorize \ndirect court of appeals review of all EPA \u201cfinal actions\u201d \nunder the CAA.  Congress achieved that result by add-\ning the catchall categories for the first two subsets of \nfinal actions, and by adding the third category of locally \nor regionally applicable actions that are based on a de-\ntermination of nationwide scope or effect.  The House \nReport accompanying the amendment explained that \nthe revision would \u201cprovide[] for essentially locally, \nstatewide, or regionally applicable rules or orders to be \n\n4 \n \nreviewed in the U.S. court of appeals for the circuit in \nwhich such locality, State, or region is located.\u201d  H.R. \nRep. No. 294, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 323 (1977) (1977 \nHouse Report).  \u201cOn the other hand,\u201d the report ex-\nplained, venue would lie only in the D.C. Circuit \u201cif an \naction of the Administrator is found by him to be based \non a determination of nationwide scope or effect (includ-\ning a determination which has scope or effect beyond a \nsingle judicial circuit).\u201d  Id. at 324.   \n2. The EPA actions at issue in this case involve the \nRenewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program, a CAA pro-\ngram that generally requires transportation fuel sold or \nintroduced into commerce in the United States to con-\ntain specified volumes of renewable fuel.  See 42 U.S.C. \n7545(o)(2)(A)(i) and (B)(i).  To implement the program, \nEPA expresses renewable-fuel targets as a percentage \nof the gasoline and diesel fuel that is projected to be sold \nin the upcoming year, and the agency adopts regulations \nto ensure compliance.  See 42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(2)(A)(i); see \nalso 42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(3).  Obligated parties \u201cuse that \nannual-percentage standard to determine their volume \nobligations\u201d for the year.  Pet. App. 3a.  Each obligated \nparty\u2019s renewable-fuel-volume obligation is propor-\ntional to its annual production or importation of gaso-\nline and diesel fuel.   \nEPA\u2019s implementing regulations identify refineries \nand importers of gasoline and diesel as obligated parties \nsubject to RFS requirements.  40 C.F.R. 80.2, 80.1406.  \nTo track whether an obligated party has satisfied RFS \nprogram requirements, EPA uses a credit system that \noffers parties flexibility in achieving compliance.  See 42 \nU.S.C. 7545(o)(5).  Producers and importers of renewa-\nble fuels generate credits\u2014called Renewable Identifi-\ncation Numbers (RINs)\u2014for each gallon of renewable \n\n5 \n \nfuel they produce or import for use in the United States.  \n40 C.F.R. 80.1426(a).  The producers and importers as-\nsign a RIN to each batch of renewable fuel.  40 C.F.R. \n80.1426(e).  A RIN may be used after it is \u201cseparated\u201d \nfrom its batch by an obligated party or by an entity that \nblends the renewable fuel into gasoline or diesel.  40 \nC.F.R. 80.1429(b).  Once separated, RINs may be kept \nfor compliance or sold.  40 C.F.R. 80.1425-80.1429.  Each \nyear, a refinery may generate its own credits by blend-\ning renewable fuel into transportation fuel, or it may \npurchase the requisite number of credits.  See Pet. App. \n206a-207a; see also 42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(5)(B) and (E); 40 \nC.F.R. 80.1428(b), 80.1429(b). \nObligated parties meet their renewable-fuel-volume \nobligations by \u201cretir[ing]\u201d RINs in an annual compli-\nance demonstration.  40 C.F.R. 80.1427(a)(1).  A refin-\nery may use a particular RIN only during the calendar \nyear in which it was generated or in the following calen-\ndar year.  40 C.F.R. 80.1427(a)(6), 80.1428(c).  An obli-\ngated party who fails to demonstrate full compliance in \none year may carry forward a compliance deficit to the \nfollowing year.  42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(5)(D).  \nCongress created a three-tiered scheme through \nwhich obligated parties that qualify as \u201c[s]mall refiner-\nies\u201d may obtain exemptions from RFS program require-\nments.  42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9) (emphasis omitted); see 42 \nU.S.C. 7545(o)(1)(k) (defining \u201csmall refinery\u201d).   \nFirst, Congress granted all small refineries a blan-\nket exemption until 2011.  42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(A)(i). \nSecond, Congress directed the U.S. Department of \nEnergy (DOE) to study \u201cwhether compliance with the \nrequirements of [the RFS program] would impose a dis-\nproportionate economic hardship on small refineries.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(A)(ii)(I).  For any small refinery \n\n6 \n \nthat DOE determined \u201cwould be subject to a dispropor-\ntionate economic hardship if required to comply,\u201d Con-\ngress directed EPA to extend the exemption for at least \ntwo years.  42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(A)(ii)(II). \nThird, Congress established a mechanism through \nwhich a small refinery \u201cmay at any time petition [EPA] \nfor an extension of the exemption under subparagraph \n(A) for the reason of disproportionate economic hard-\nship.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(B)(i).  In evaluating a peti-\ntion for such an exemption, EPA, \u201cin consultation with\u201d \nDOE, \u201cshall consider the findings of [DOE\u2019s study] and \nother economic factors.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(B)(ii). \nB. Facts And Proceedings Below \n1. In August 2019, EPA issued a single decision act-\ning on 36 exemption petitions filed by small refineries \nfor the 2018 compliance year, granting 31 petitions and \ndenying five.  See C.A. App. 2928.  Multiple parties pe-\ntitioned for review of the action in the D.C. Circuit.  See \nSinclair Wyoming Ref. Co. v. EPA, No. 19-1196; Big \nWest Oil, LLC v. EPA, No. 19-1197; Renewable Fuels \nAss\u2019n v. EPA, No. 19-1220; Kern Oil & Ref. Co. v. EPA, \nNo. 19-1216; Wynnewood Ref. Co. v. EPA, No. 20-1099.   \nWhile those challenges were pending, the Tenth Cir-\ncuit issued a decision vacating and remanding three \nEPA orders granting three exemption petitions for the \n2016 and 2017 compliance years.  Renewable Fuels Ass\u2019n \nv. EPA, 948 F.3d 1206, 1258 (2020).  The court held that \na small refinery is eligible for an extension of an exemp-\ntion only if it has maintained a continuous, uninter-\nrupted exemption, id. at 1245-1249; that \u201crenewable \nfuels compliance must be the cause of any dispropor-\ntionate hardship\u201d in order for an exemption to be avail-\nable, id. at 1253; and that EPA had \u201c\u200a\u2018failed to consider \nan important aspect of the problem\u2019\u200a\u201d when it did not ad-\n\n7 \n \ndress whether refiners could \u201cpass RIN costs on to cus-\ntomers,\u201d id. at 1257 (citation omitted).  This Court \ngranted a petition for a writ of certiorari limited to the \nfirst of those Tenth Circuit holdings.  HollyFrontier \nCheyenne Ref., LLC v. Renewable Fuels Ass\u2019n, 141  \nS. Ct. 974 (2021).  Pending this Court\u2019s resolution of \nHollyFrontier, the D.C. Circuit granted EPA\u2019s motion \nto hold in abeyance the petitions for review that had \nbeen filed in that court. See Sinclair Wyoming Ref. Co. \nv. EPA, No. 19-1196, Doc. 1883334 (Feb. 2, 2021); p. 6, \nsupra.   \nThis Court reversed the Tenth Circuit decision in \nHollyFrontier, holding that a small refinery may be el-\nigible for an exemption renewal even if the refinery had \nallowed a prior exemption to lapse.  HollyFrontier \nCheyenne Ref., LLC v. Renewable Fuels Ass\u2019n, 594 U.S. \n382, 390 (2021).  In the pending D.C. Circuit proceed-\nings, EPA then moved for a voluntary remand without \nvacatur to allow the agency to reconsider its action on \nthe 2018 exemption petitions in light of this Court\u2019s de-\ncision in HollyFrontier, and in light of the Tenth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s analysis in Renewable Fuels Association of addi-\ntional issues this Court had not reached.  See Sinclair \nWyoming Ref. Co., No. 19-1196, Doc. 1911606 (Aug. 25, \n2021).  The D.C. Circuit granted that motion and in-\nstructed EPA to act on the petitions within 120 days.  \nSinclair Wyoming Ref. Co., No. 19-1196, Doc. 1925942 \n(Dec. 8, 2021).   \n2. In December 2021, EPA proposed to deny all \npending small refinery exemption petitions.  86 Fed. \nReg. 70,999 (Dec. 14, 2021); see C.A. App. 520-585.  \nSeeking to create a nationally uniform program, EPA \nproposed to adopt the Tenth Circuit\u2019s reasoning in Re-\nnewable Fuels Association on the issues this Court had \n\n8 \n \nnot considered.  Under that approach, EPA proposed to \ninterpret the pertinent statutory provisions as requir-\ning small refineries seeking exemptions to show that \nRFS compliance itself caused a disproportionate eco-\nnomic hardship.  C.A. App. 545-548.  In accordance with \nthe Tenth Circuit\u2019s analysis, EPA also analyzed whether \nrefineries were able to pass on the costs of RFS compli-\nance to consumers.  The agency concluded that the evi-\ndence supported a rebuttable presumption that such \ncosts \u201care fully passed through to consumers,\u201d so that \nsmall refineries ordinarily would not suffer dispropor-\ntionate economic hardship as a result of RFS compli-\nance.  Id. at 549; see id. at 548-584.  In light of those \nconclusions, EPA proposed to deny all the pending ex-\nemption petitions and sought comment on that pro-\nposed decision.   \nAfter the comment period ended, EPA took two ac-\ntions.  In April 2022\u2014the deadline set by the D.C. Cir-\ncuit to resolve the remanded petitions\u2014EPA denied 36 \nexemption petitions filed by small refineries for the \n2018 compliance year.  Pet. App. 193a; see April 2022 \nDenial of Petitions for Small Refinery Exemptions \nUnder the Renewable Fuel Standard Program, 87 Fed. \nReg. 24,300 (Apr. 25, 2022) (April Notice).  In June \n2022, EPA denied an additional 69 petitions for the \n2016-2021 compliance years.  Pet. App. 48a; see Notice \nof June 2022 Denial of Petitions for Small Refinery Ex-\nemptions Under the Renewable Fuel Standard Pro-\ngram, 87 Fed. Reg. 34,873, 34,874 (June 8, 2022) (June \nNotice).  The two denial actions reflect the same reason-\ning and are based on two principal rationales, one stat-\nutory and one economic.1  The denial actions contain ex-\n \n1  For ease of reference, this brief cites only the April 2022 denial \nwhen discussing reasoning common to both actions. \n\n9 \n \nplicit agency findings that the actions are nationally ap-\nplicable or, in the alternative, that they are based on de-\nterminations of nationwide scope or effect. \nStatutory interpretation.  In the April and June 2022 \ndenial actions, EPA concluded that an extension of the \nsmall refinery exemption under the relevant provisions \nmay be granted only if disproportionate economic hard-\nship was \u201ccaused by RFS compliance.\u201d  Pet. App. 242a.  \nFor relevant context, the agency turned to paragraph \n(A) of 42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9), which established the initial \nblanket exemption for small refineries and the two-year \nextension based on the DOE study.  See 42 U.S.C. \n7545(o)(9)(A) and (B).  The agency observed that para-\ngraph (A) focuses on \u201cwhether compliance with the re-\nquirements of [the RFS program] would impose a [dis-\nproportionate economic hardship] on small refineries.\u201d  \nPet. App. 243a (quoting 42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(A)(ii)(I)).  \nBecause paragraph (B) provides for an extension of the \nexemption provided by paragraph (A), EPA construed \nparagraph (B) to require a similar causal connection be-\ntween RFS compliance and any resulting economic \nhardship.  Id. at 245a.  The agency found it \u201chard to im-\nagine that Congress intended\u201d to permit exemptions for \nhardships resulting from \u201ca broad array of circum-\nstances unrelated to the RFS program.\u201d  Id. at 247a. \nEconomic analysis.  In implementing the RFS pro-\ngram, EPA has made \u201clongstanding and consistent \nfindings\u201d that obligated parties can pass the costs of \nRFS compliance on to purchasers, a phenomenon called \nRIN cost passthrough.  Pet. App. 248a; see, e.g., Alon \nRef. Krotz Springs, Inc. v. EPA, 936 F.3d 628, 649-650 \n(D.C. Cir. 2019) (per curiam) (discussing earlier studies \nreaching this conclusion), cert. denied, 140 S. Ct. 2792 \n(2020).  In the April and June 2022 denial actions, EPA \n\n10 \n \nreassessed and reaffirmed those prior findings.  Pet. \nApp. 248a-303a; see id. at 240a-241a (explaining related \nconcept of \u201cRIN discount\u201d).  After reviewing extensive \nmarket data, the agency determined that \u201call obligated \nparties recover the cost of acquiring RINs by selling the \ngasoline and diesel fuel they produce at the market \nprice, which reflects these RIN costs.\u201d  Id. at 249a.  EPA \nfurther concluded that \u201cRINs are generally widely \navailable in an open and liquid market,\u201d and that the \n\u201ccost of acquiring RINs is the same for all parties.\u201d  \nIbid. \nGiven that all refineries bear the same costs of RFS \ncompliance and can recover those costs by selling at \nmarket price, EPA found that such costs presumptively \ndo not cause disproportionate economic hardship to any \nsmall refinery.  Pet. App. 248a-250a.  EPA determined \nthat none of the petitioning small refineries had rebut-\nted that presumption through evidence about their spe-\ncific circumstances.  Id. at 251a-252a; see id. at 305a-\n310a. \nVenue.  EPA determined that the denial actions are \nsubject to review exclusively in the D.C. Circuit because \nthey are \u201c\u200a\u2018nationally applicable\u2019\u200a\u201d or, in the alternative, \nbecause they are \u201cbased on a determination of \u2018nation-\nwide scope or effect.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. 328a; id. at 187a (same \nfor June 2022 denial action); see April Notice, 87 Fed. \nReg. at 24,300-24,301; June Notice, 87 Fed. Reg. at \n34,874.  The agency explained that the April 2022 denial \naction encompasses petitions from more than 30 small \nrefineries located within 18 States in seven of the ten \nEPA regions and in eight different federal judicial cir-\ncuits.  Pet. App. 329a; see id. at 187a (similar for June \ndenial).  The agency further observed that the denial \nactions are \u201cbased on EPA\u2019s revised interpretation of \n\n11 \n \nthe relevant CAA provisions and the  * * *  RIN cost \npassthrough principles that are applicable to all small \nrefineries no matter the location or market in which \nthey operate.\u201d  Id. at 329a; see id. at 187a-188a. \n3. Six small refineries filed petitions for review in \nthe Fifth Circuit, collectively challenging both denial \nactions.  Pet. App. 2a, 6a.  Various renewable-fuel trade \nassociations were granted leave to intervene as respond-\nents.  See 22-60266 C.A. Doc. 303-1 (Mar. 16, 2023).  The \ncourt granted the petitions for review, vacated the de-\nnial actions as to the six petitioners, and remanded to \nEPA for further proceedings.  Pet. App. 1a-34a. \na. The court of appeals denied EPA\u2019s motion to trans-\nfer the petitions to the D.C. Circuit.  Pet. App. 9a-15a.  \nThe court held that the denial actions are \u201clocally or re-\ngionally applicable\u201d rather than \u201cnationally applicable,\u201d \n42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1), because the actions\u2019 \u201clegal effect\u201d \nis limited to the petitioning refineries, and the actions \ndo not \u201cbind[\u200a] EPA in any future adjudication,\u201d Pet. \nApp. 11a-12a (emphases omitted).   \nThe court of appeals further held that neither denial \naction is \u201cbased on a determination of nationwide scope \nor effect.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  The court acknowl-\nedged, but disagreed with, EPA\u2019s express finding that \nthe denial actions were based on such determinations.  \nPet. App. 12a-14a.  The court noted that, under EPA\u2019s \ninterpretation of the relevant provisions, the agency \nwill review refinery-specific information to determine \nwhether there is any basis to depart from EPA\u2019s gen-\neral conclusions about market conditions and RIN \npassthrough.  Id. at 15a.  The court of appeals concluded \nthat, because \u201cthere is still a non-zero chance [EPA] will \ngrant small refinery petitions\u201d based on \u201cdata and evi-\ndence\u201d about particular refineries\u2019 circumstances, \u201cthe \n\n12 \n \nDenial Actions rely on refinery-specific determinations \nand are not based on a determination of nationwide \nscope or effect.\u201d  Ibid. \nOn the merits, the Fifth Circuit held the denial ac-\ntions unlawful on three grounds.  Pet. App. 16a-33a.  \nFirst, the court found that small refineries have a pro-\ntectable property interest in being exempt from RFS \nprogram obligations, and that EPA had impermissibly \napplied its new analysis retroactively to deprive the re-\nfineries here of that interest.  Id. at 16a.  Second, the \ncourt rejected the agency\u2019s interpretation of the gov-\nerning statutory language.  The court characterized the \nagency\u2019s position as requiring that \u201ccompliance costs \nmust be the sole cause of\u200a\u201d hardship, id. at 23a, and it \ndisagreed on the ground that hardship may have \u201cmyr-\niad causes,\u201d id. at 25a.  Third, the court concluded that \nthe agency had acted arbitrarily and capriciously.  Id. \nat 29a-33a.  Without questioning the agency\u2019s RIN cost \npassthrough analysis as a general matter, id. at 31a \nn.44, the court found that the analysis was undermined \nas to the petitioning refineries by data concerning the \nparticular local markets in which they operate, id. at \n31a-33a. \nb.

Unlike the Fifth Circuit, however, the \nD.C. Circuit declined to address whether EPA\u2019s ap-\nproach was impermissibly retroactive.  Id. at 714 n.12.   \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nUnder the plain terms of Section 7607(b)(1), the de-\nnial actions here are reviewable only in the D.C. Circuit.  \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s contrary decision imposes atextual \nrequirements and fails to give effect to the provision \nCongress enacted.   \nA.  Under Section 7607(b)(1), \u201cnationally applicable\u201d \nEPA final actions are subject to judicial review only in \nthe D.C. Circuit.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  To apply that \nstatutory requirement, courts consider the final action \non its face and determine whether it applies to entities \nlocated throughout the country rather than in a single \nregion.  The denial actions here qualify as \u201cnationally \napplicable\u201d on that basis:  They resolve exemption peti-\ntions from small refineries located in 18 States and eight \nfederal judicial circuits across the country.   \nStatutory context confirms that result.  Section \n7607(b)(1) distinguishes between \u201cnationally applica-\nble\u201d EPA actions, which are subject to review in the \nD.C. Circuit, and \u201clocally or regionally applicable\u201d ac-\ntions, which are subject to review in \u201cthe appropriate \ncircuit.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1) (emphasis added).  Con-\ngress\u2019s use of the definite article indicates that there is \nonly one \u201cappropriate circuit\u201d for review of any partic-\nular \u201clocally or regionally applicable\u201d action.  When an \nEPA action applies to entities in multiple circuits, no \nsingle regional circuit can be identified as \u201cthe\u201d appro-\n\n15 \n \npriate venue, so the action is properly viewed as \u201cna-\ntionally applicable\u201d rather than \u201clocally or regionally \napplicable.\u201d   \nSection 7607(b)(1)\u2019s legislative history reinforces \nthat conclusion.  That history reflects Congress\u2019s un-\nderstanding that any \u201clocally or regionally applicable\u201d \naction could be reviewed in the regional court of appeals \nwhere the affected entity was located.  Where affected \nentities are spread across multiple circuits, however, \nCongress viewed the D.C. Circuit as the proper venue.   \nIn endorsing the contrary conclusion, both the court \nof appeals and respondents go beyond the statutory text \nto impose additional restrictions on the availability of \nD.C. Circuit review.  The court of appeals required that \nthe final action have a prospective effect on future \nagency decisions.  But the court did not ground that re-\nquirement in the statutory text, and respondents do not \ndefend it.  Respondents instead argue that, for venue \npurposes, the Court should treat the denial of each re-\nfinery\u2019s exemption petition as a separate \u201cfinal action.\u201d  \nBut that requirement likewise is untethered to the stat-\nutory text, and this Court has long recognized that \nagencies have discretion to devise their own procedures, \nincluding by aggregating common issues for joint reso-\nlution.  EPA acted reasonably in taking that approach \nhere.  And in determining the proper venue for chal-\nlenges to the agency\u2019s denial actions, the Court should \nfocus on the actions that EPA actually took, rather than \non a hypothetical array of 105 separate, refinery-specific \ndisapprovals. \nB.  Even if this Court finds the denial actions here to \nbe \u201clocally or regionally applicable,\u201d those actions are \nstill subject to review only in the D.C. Circuit because \nthey are \u201cbased on a determination of nationwide scope \n\n16 \n \nor effect,\u201d and EPA published its findings to that effect \nin accordance with Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s requirements.  \n42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).   \nIn requiring a \u201cdetermination of nationwide scope or \neffect,\u201d the statutory text focuses on the underlying \nreasons for EPA\u2019s final action.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  \nThe final action must be \u201cbased on\u201d the relevant deter-\nminations, indicating that the determinations must be a \nbut-for cause of the agency\u2019s final action\u2014forming the \ncore of the agency\u2019s analysis.  And to be nationwide in \nscope or effect, the core justifications for EPA\u2019s final \naction must be intended to govern the agency\u2019s deci-\nsionmaking in actions throughout the country, or have \nlegal consequences for entities beyond a single judicial \ncircuit.   \nThe denial actions here meet those requirements.  \nEPA found that the denial actions were based on two in-\nterrelated determinations of nationwide scope:  (1) EPA\u2019s \nstatutory interpretation that a small refinery\u2019s dispro-\nportionate economic hardship will support an exemp-\ntion only if it is caused by compliance with the RFS pro-\ngram; and (2) EPA\u2019s economic analysis of the national \nmarket for RINs, which found that the cost to acquire \nRINs is the same for refineries everywhere and is \npassed through to consumers in the price of fuels.  Those \ndeterminations apply to all small refinery exemption re-\nquests under the RFS program as a whole, and they \nwere the core rationales for EPA\u2019s denials of the ex-\nemption requests.   \nStatutory history confirms Congress\u2019s intent that \nEPA actions like the denial actions here would be re-\nviewable in the D.C. Circuit.  The original 1970 version \nof the venue provision did not specifically authorize \nD.C. Circuit review of final actions that are based on a \n\n17 \n \ndetermination of nationwide scope or effect.  That stat-\nutory gap led to litigation over which circuit qualified as \n\u201cthe appropriate circuit\u201d when EPA issued an action \nthat established a legal framework for implementation \nplans that spanned multiple States in multiple judicial \ncircuits.  In amending the statute to its current form, \nCongress adopted the view expressed by EPA\u2019s then-\nGeneral Counsel, who urged that challenges to such ac-\ntions should be channeled to the D.C. Circuit to \u201ccen-\ntralize review\u201d and \u201ctak[e] advantage of [the D.C. Cir-\ncuit\u2019s] administrative law expertise,\u201d thereby \u201cfacilitat-\ning an orderly development of the basic law\u201d that EPA \nwould apply nationwide.  41 Fed. Reg. 56,767, 56,769 \n(Dec. 30, 1976).   \nThe court of appeals and respondents have not dis-\nputed that the EPA actions at issue here rested in part \non interpretive and economic determinations having na-\ntionwide scope or effect.  They have observed, however, \nthat EPA also considered refinery-specific facts in rul-\ning on the exemption requests.  But the statute does not \nrequire that the final action be based solely on determi-\nnations of nationwide scope or effect.  Nor would such a \nlimitation make sense.  The third prong of Section \n7607(b)(1) comes into play only when the challenged \nEPA action is \u201clocally or regionally applicable,\u201d and \nsuch actions almost always will rest at least in part on \nconsideration of local or regional circumstances.  42 \nU.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  \nRespondents are also incorrect in asserting that \nEPA\u2019s interpretation would allow for D.C. Circuit venue \nfor challenges to every locally or regionally applicable \naction.  The statute imposes meaningful limits on EPA\u2019s \nauthority to find that a particular action is \u201cbased on a \ndetermination of nationwide scope or effect.\u201d  Courts \n\n18 \n \nshould enforce those limits without adding more of their \nown making.   \nARGUMENT \nTHE D.C. CIRCUIT IS THE APPROPRIATE VENUE FOR \nREVIEW OF THE DENIAL ACTIONS AT ISSUE HERE \nThe CAA\u2019s venue provision reflects a clear congres-\nsional preference for \u201cuniform judicial review of regula-\ntory issues of national importance.\u201d  National Environ-\nmental Development Ass\u2019n Clean Air Project v. EPA, \n891 F.3d 1041, 1054 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (Silberman, J., con-\ncurring).  Section 7607(b)(1) specifies two distinct cir-\ncumstances in which review of nationally significant \nEPA actions will be channeled to the D.C. Circuit.  First, \nany \u201cnationally applicable\u201d final action is subject to re-\nview exclusively in the D.C. Circuit.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  \nSecond, even if a challenged final action is \u201clocally or \nregionally applicable,\u201d venue lies exclusively in the D.C. \nCircuit if that action is \u201cbased on a determination of na-\ntionwide scope or effect and if in taking such action the \nAdministrator finds and publishes that such action is \nbased on such a determination.\u201d  Ibid.   \nBecause the denial actions at issue here resolve the \nexemption petitions of small refineries across the coun-\ntry, those actions are \u201cnationally applicable\u201d within the \nmeaning of Section 7607(b)(1).  In the alternative, if the \nCourt views the denial actions as \u201clocally or regionally \napplicable,\u201d those EPA actions are based on determina-\ntions of nationwide scope because they are grounded in \nEPA\u2019s statutory interpretation and analysis of market-\nplace conditions, both of which apply to all small refin-\nery exemption requests under the RFS program as a \nwhole.  Section 7607(b)(1) thus requires that challenges \nto the denial actions be brought in the D.C. Circuit. \n\n19 \n \nIndeed, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision in this case pro-\nvides a paradigmatic example of the outcome that Sec-\ntion 7607(b)(1) was intended to prevent.  The two EPA \ndenial actions at issue here collectively covered 105 ex-\nemption petitions from 39 small refineries located in \neight different judicial circuits.  The actions were prem-\nised on a statutory interpretation and an economic anal-\nysis that the agency had not previously announced, and \nthat constituted \u201cdetermination[s] of nationwide scope \nor effect\u201d under any reasonable understanding of that \nphrase.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  The ensuing briefing in \nthe court of appeals focused primarily on those nation-\nwide determinations, not on refinery-specific circum-\nstances.  The denial actions thus are precisely the types \nof EPA actions that Congress regarded as appropriate \nfor centralized D.C. Circuit review. \nUnder the Fifth Circuit\u2019s venue analysis, however, \nthe 25 covered refineries that challenged EPA\u2019s denial \nactions in court could have obtained judicial review only \nthrough individual challenges filed in seven different re-\ngional circuits.  That extreme fragmentation was avoided \nhere only because some refineries initially petitioned \nfor review in the D.C. Circuit, and five other regional \ncircuits either dismissed petitions for lack of venue or \ntransferred petitions to that court.  But if this Court en-\ndorses the Fifth Circuit\u2019s venue analysis, future chal-\nlenges to similar EPA actions can be expected to con-\nsume far greater judicial resources, with consequent \nheightened risks of inconsistent outcomes.  Congress \ncrafted Section 7607(b)(1) to avoid that result, and this \nCourt should vacate the court of appeals\u2019 judgment. \nA. The Denial Actions Are Nationally Applicable \nEach of the two denial actions resolved the exemp-\ntion petitions of more than 30 small refineries located in \n\n20 \n \nmultiple judicial circuits across the country.  It there-\nfore is apparent on the face of the final actions that they \nare \u201cnationally applicable\u201d and subject to review in the \nD.C. Circuit.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  The contrary argu-\nments advanced by the court of appeals and respond-\nents do not contest the reach of the two denial actions \nEPA issued, but instead advocate additional limitations \nthat the statutory text does not impose.   \n1.  The text, context, and history of Section 7607(b)(1) \nmake clear that the denial actions are nationally ap-\nplicable  \nSection 7607(b)(1) instructs that a challenge to a \u201cfi-\nnal action\u201d that is \u201cnationally applicable\u201d must be heard \nin the D.C. Circuit.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  That language \nencompasses the denial actions at issue here because \nthose actions apply to small refineries in multiple judi-\ncial circuits throughout the country.  The statutory con-\ntext and history confirm Congress\u2019s intent that the D.C. \nCircuit would review challenges to such actions.   \na. Under the text of Section 7607(b)(1), the proper \nvenue for challenges to EPA\u2019s implementation of the \nCAA depends on the \u201cfinal action\u201d that is being chal-\nlenged.  The term \u201caction\u201d in Section 7607(b)(1) \u201cis \nmeant to cover comprehensively every manner in which \nan agency may exercise its power.\u201d  Whitman v. Amer-\nican Trucking Ass\u2019ns, 531 U.S. 457, 478 (2001).  And as \nnumerous courts of appeals have recognized, the statu-\ntory text makes clear that venue turns on the nature of \nthe pertinent EPA action rather than on the basis for a \nparticular petitioner\u2019s challenge.  See, e.g., Hunt Ref. \nCo. v. EPA, 90 F.4th 1107, 1110 (11th Cir. 2024); South-\nern Ill. Power Coop. v. EPA, 863 F.3d 666, 671 (7th Cir. \n2017); American Road & Transp. Builders Ass\u2019n v. \nEPA, 705 F.3d 453, 455 (D.C. Cir. 2013), cert. denied, \n\n21 \n \n571 U.S. 1125 (2014); ATK Launch Sys., Inc. v. EPA, \n651 F.3d 1194, 1197 (10th Cir. 2011).  Courts thus must \nlook to the face of the action and determine whether it \napplies to\u2014or includes \u201cwithin its scope,\u201d Black\u2019s Law \nDictionary 91 (5th ed. 1979) (Black\u2019s) (defining \u201cap-\nply\u201d)\u2014entities \u201cthroughout [the] nation,\u201d Webster\u2019s \nThird New International Dictionary of the English \nLanguage 1505 (1976) (Webster\u2019s) (defining \u201cnation-\nally\u201d).     \nStatutory context sheds further light on what geo-\ngraphic scope an action must have to be \u201cnationally ap-\nplicable.\u201d  Under Section 7607(b)(1), each EPA action is \neither \u201cnationally applicable\u201d or \u201clocally or regionally \napplicable.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  In distinguishing be-\ntween those two types of actions, \u201c[t]he text of the stat-\nute leaves no room for an intermediate case.\u201d  Southern \nIll. Power Coop., 863 F.3d at 673.  If the challenged ac-\ntion is \u201cnationally applicable,\u201d the D.C. Circuit is the ex-\nclusive forum for judicial review.  And unless a \u201clocally \nor regionally applicable\u201d action is \u201cbased on a determi-\nnation of nationwide scope or effect,\u201d it may be chal-\nlenged \u201conly in the United States Court of Appeals for \nthe appropriate circuit.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  The stat-\nute\u2019s use of the definite article\u2014\u201cthe appropriate cir-\ncuit,\u201d ibid. (emphasis added)\u2014indicates that, for any \ngiven locally or regionally applicable EPA action, there \nis only one appropriate regional court of appeals in \nwhich to seek review.  Cf. Rumsfeld v. Padilla, 542 U.S. \n426, 434 (2004) (explaining that the \u201cuse of the definite \narticle\u201d in the federal habeas statute \u201cindicates that \n\n22 \n \nthere is generally only one proper respondent to a given \nprisoner\u2019s habeas petition\u201d).4 \nThe existence of a single appropriate court of ap-\npeals for this category of EPA actions in turn conveys \nthat a particular action is \u201clocally or regionally applica-\nble\u201d only if it applies to entities that are confined to a \nsingle judicial circuit.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  After all, \nfor an action that applies equally to entities in more \nthan one judicial circuit, no particular court of appeals \ncan be identified as \u201cthe appropriate circuit\u201d for review.  \nIbid. (emphasis added).  Thus, any action that spans \nmore than one judicial circuit is properly viewed as \u201cna-\ntionally applicable\u201d and subject to review only in the \nD.C. Circuit.  Ibid.   \nb. The history of Section 7607(b)(1) reflects the \nsame understanding.  As originally enacted in 1970, the \nCAA venue provision stated that any action \u201cpromul-\ngating any national primary or secondary ambient air \nquality standard,\u201d \u201cemission standard,\u201d \u201cstandard of \nperformance,\u201d or other specified standards or controls, \nwould be reviewable only in the D.C. Circuit.  42 U.S.C. \n1857h-5(b)(1) (1970).  The provision further specified \nthat any action \u201capproving or promulgating any imple-\nmentation plan\u201d could be reviewed only in \u201cthe appro-\npriate circuit.\u201d  Ibid.  Because that venue provision did \nnot specify the proper court for review of the many EPA \nactions that did not fall within any of the enumerated \ncategories, such actions were reviewable only by dis-\n \n4  Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s reference to \u201cthe appropriate circuit,\u201d 42 \nU.S.C. 7607(b)(1) (emphasis added), contrasts with the preceding \nsubsection, where Congress contemplated the prospect of multiple \npermissible forums by authorizing \u201cthe district court  * * *  for any \ndistrict in which such person is found or resides or transacts busi-\nness\u201d to issue certain orders, 42 U.S.C. 7607(a) (emphasis added). \n\n23 \n \ntrict courts exercising federal-question jurisdiction.  \nSee p. 3, supra.   \nThe actions that Congress specified for D.C. Circuit \nreview in the 1970 statute were all \u201cnational in scope,\u201d \nand Congress sought to ensure that they received \u201ceven \nand consistent national application\u201d through centralized \nreview.  1970 Senate Report 41.  By contrast, Congress \nviewed EPA actions approving or promulgating \u201cimple-\nmentation plans which run only to one air quality con-\ntrol region\u201d as amenable to review \u201cin the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Circuit in which the affected air quality \ncontrol region, or portion thereof, is located,\u201d ibid., \nwhich the statute referred to as \u201cthe appropriate cir-\ncuit,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 1857h-5(b)(1) (1970).   \nWhen Congress amended the statute in 1977 to ex-\npand the scope of direct court of appeals review, it \nadopted the same understanding of the limited geo-\ngraphic scope of actions that would be subject to review \nin \u201cthe appropriate circuit.\u201d  The 1977 House Report ex-\nplained that the revision would \u201cprovide[] for essen-\ntially locally, statewide, or regionally applicable rules or \norders to be reviewed in the U.S. court of appeals for \nthe circuit in which such locality, State, or region is lo-\ncated.\u201d  1977 House Report 323.  And the House Report \ncontrasted such local actions with nationally relevant \nactions that extend \u201cbeyond a single judicial circuit\u201d \nand therefore should be subject to centralized D.C. Cir-\ncuit review.  Id. at 324.  That history reinforces the con-\nclusion that, under the venue provision in its current \nform, final EPA actions that apply to entities in multiple \njudicial circuits are reviewable only in the D.C. Circuit.   \nc. Applying that understanding here, the denial ac-\ntions are nationally applicable.  EPA \u201cexercise[d] its \npower\u201d through two final denial actions, each of which \n\n24 \n \napplies to multiple entities located throughout the coun-\ntry in multiple federal judicial circuits.  Whitman, 531 \nU.S. at 478.  The April 2022 denial action covers \u201c36  \n* * *  petitions for exemptions from the RFS program \nfor over 30 small refineries across the country and ap-\nplies to small refineries located within 18 states in 7 of \nthe 10 EPA regions and in 8 different federal judicial \ncircuits.\u201d  Pet. App. 329a.  The June 2022 denial action \ncovers \u201c69 petitions for exemptions from the RFS pro-\ngram for over 30 small refineries across the country and \napplies to small refineries located within 15 states in 7 \nof the 10 EPA regions and in 8 different Federal judicial \ncircuits.\u201d  Id. at 187a.  On a plain-text understanding, \neach of the two denial actions is therefore \u201cnationally \napplicable,\u201d and respondents\u2019 challenges to those ac-\ntions can proceed only in the D.C. Circuit.  42 U.S.C. \n7607(b)(1); see Hunt Ref. Co., 90 F.4th at 1110.   \n2.  The court of appeals\u2019 and respondents\u2019 contrary rea-\nsoning is inconsistent with the statutory text  \nNeither the court of appeals nor respondents have \ndisputed that the denial actions at issue here apply to \nsmall refineries in multiple judicial circuits across the \ncountry.  Nor have they disputed the general proposi-\ntion that, when an EPA final action applies to entities in \nmultiple judicial circuits, that action is \u201cnationally ap-\nplicable\u201d within the meaning of Section 7607(b)(1).  The \ncourt of appeals nevertheless held that the denial ac-\ntions are not \u201cnationally applicable\u201d because those ac-\ntions apply only to the specific refineries whose exemp-\ntion petitions EPA adjudicated, and those adjudications \nwill not bind the agency in any future proceeding.  Re-\nspondents have not endorsed that rationale, but have \nargued instead that the denial actions should be viewed \nfor venue purposes as 105 separate denials of 105 ex-\n\n25 \n \nemption petitions, each of which is confined to a single \njudicial circuit.  Those arguments lack merit. \na. The court of appeals found it significant that the \ndenial actions apply only to the petitioning refineries \nand do not \u201cbind[] EPA in any future adjudication.\u201d  \nPet. App. 12a.  But the court did not attempt to tether \nthat observation to the statutory text.  And nothing in \nSection 7607(b)(1) suggests that a final action must bind \nEPA prospectively in order to be considered \u201cnationally \napplicable.\u201d  The court of appeals erred by effectively \n\u201cadd[ing] words  * * *  to the statute Congress enacted\u201d \nand \u201cimpos[ing] a new requirement\u201d that atextually lim-\nits the category of actions encompassed within Section \n7607(b)(1)\u2019s first category.  Muldrow v. City of St. \nLouis, 601 U.S. 346, 355 (2024).   \nIndeed, under the court of appeals\u2019 approach, virtu-\nally no adjudicatory actions would be deemed \u201cnation-\nally applicable\u201d because agency adjudications typically \n\u201clack \u2018legal effect\u2019 beyond the parties involved.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 39a (Higginbotham, J., dissenting).  But the venue \nprovision at issue here refers broadly to \u201cany other na-\ntionally applicable regulations promulgated, or final ac-\ntion taken.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1) (emphasis added).  \nSuch \u201cexpansive language\u201d is not amenable to the kind \nof \u201climiting construction\u201d the court of appeals\u2019 analysis \nwould impose.  Harrison v. PPG Industries, Inc., 446 \nU.S. 578, 589 (1980); see Whitman, 531 U.S. at 478.  \nElsewhere in Section 7607(b)(1), Congress distinguished \namong particular agency actions by referring specifi-\ncally to a \u201cregulation[]\u201d or \u201corder.\u201d  42 U.S.C 7607(b)(1).  \nIn contrast, Congress\u2019s reference to \u201cany other nation-\nally applicable  * * *  final action\u201d should be given its \nnatural meaning rather than subjected to artificial con-\nstraints.  Ibid.; cf. Nielsen v. Preap, 586 U.S. 392, 414 \n\n26 \n \n(2019) (presuming that \u201cevery word and every provi-\nsion\u201d in a statute \u201cis to be given effect\u201d) (citation omit-\nted).   \nb. Respondents do not defend the court of appeals\u2019 \nreliance on the adjudicative character of the denial ac-\ntions.  Instead, respondents contend (Br. in Opp. 17-21) \nthat, for purposes of the venue provision, the relevant \n\u201cfinal action[s]\u201d are not the two denial actions issued in \nApril and June of 2022, but rather 105 separate denials \nof the various petitioning refineries\u2019 exemption re-\nquests.  That is incorrect.   \nRespondents argue that here, \u201c[t]he final EPA action \n\u2018under\u2019 the CAA is EPA\u2019s adjudication of individual \nhardship petitions.\u201d  Br. in Opp. 18.  Respondents high-\nlight the fact that Section 7545(o)(9)(B) allows \u201ca small \nrefinery\u201d to petition for an exemption and requires EPA \nto \u201cevaluat[e] a petition.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(B) (em-\nphases added).  But neither that CAA provision nor any \nother restricts EPA\u2019s ability to consider petitions to-\ngether and resolve common issues in a single action.  \nThe court of appeals recognized that \u201c[w]ithout more,\u201d \nthe use of \u201can indefinite article immediately followed \nwith a singular noun\u201d does not \u201cshow that the relevant \nstatutory provisions require EPA to consider exemp-\ntion petitions individually.\u201d  Pet. App. 29a.   \nThe Dictionary Act, ch. 71, 16 Stat. 431, instructs \nthat, \u201cunless the context indicates otherwise[,] words \nimporting the singular include and apply to several per-\nsons, parties, or things.\u201d  1 U.S.C. 1.  Here, the context \nprovides no reason to doubt that EPA may evaluate \nmultiple petitions in a single action.  Indeed, this Court \nhas long recognized that administrative agencies \n\u201cshould be free to fashion their own rules of procedure \nand to pursue methods of inquiry capable of permitting \n\n27 \n \nthem to discharge their multitudinous duties.\u201d  FCC v. \nPottsville Broadcasting Co., 309 U.S. 134, 143 (1940); \nsee Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural \nResources Defense Council, 435 U.S. 519, 524 (1978) \n(\u201c[T]his Court has for more than four decades empha-\nsized that the formulation of procedures was basically \nto be left within the discretion of the agencies to which \nCongress had confided the responsibility for substan-\ntive judgments.\u201d).  That discretion includes the ability \nto determine \u201cwhether applications should be heard \ncontemporaneously or successively.\u201d  Pottsville, 309 \nU.S. at 138.  Section 7545(o)(9)(B)\u2019s use of an indefinite \narticle is an insufficient basis for inferring any con-\nstraint on EPA\u2019s discretion to aggregate similar peti-\ntions for joint resolution.    \nThere is nothing unusual or problematic about EPA\u2019s \ndecision to group the various exemption petitions to de-\ncide the common issues that affect refineries across the \ncountry.  That approach aligns with Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s \naim to promote national uniformity and with EPA\u2019s \nlongstanding practice of resolving similar issues in a \nsingle action to ensure consistent treatment.  See ATK \nLaunch Sys., 651 F.3d at 1197 (single EPA action prom-\nulgating air quality designations for 31 areas across 18 \nStates); RMS of Ga., LLC v. EPA, 64 F.4th 1368, 1371 \n(11th Cir. 2023) (single EPA action adjudicating allow-\nance requests and issuing allowances to 32 entities to \nconsume hydrofluorocarbons); West Virginia Chamber \nof Commerce v. Browner, 166 F.3d 336 (4th Cir. 1998) \n(Tbl.) (per curiam) (single EPA action declaring that 22 \nStates\u2019 implementation plans were inadequate and re-\nquired revisions).  Indeed, such aggregation generally \nis encouraged as a means of efficiently adjudicating \ncommon issues.  See Committee on Adjudication, Ad-\n\n28 \n \nministrative Conference of the United States, Aggrega-\ntion of Similar Claims in Agency Adjudication (June \n13, 2016), https://perma.cc/2UQS-TJ6F. \nEPA\u2019s approach was particularly sensible here.  \nEPA was considering the exemption petitions in light of \nthis Court\u2019s decision in HollyFrontier, and in light of \nthe Tenth Circuit\u2019s reasoning in Renewable Fuels Asso-\nciation on issues this Court had not addressed.  See pp. \n6-7, supra.  EPA grouped the petitions together for res-\nolution in order to \u201capply one consistent statutory in-\nterpretation and economic analysis to thirty-six small \nrefineries, located in eighteen different states, in the ge-\nographical boundaries of eight different circuit courts.\u201d  \nPet. App. 38a (Higginbotham, J., dissenting); see also \npp. 7-8, supra.   \nIn making prior exemption decisions, EPA has some-\ntimes declined to group multiple petitions for resolution \nin a single action because the agency concluded that the \ncircumstances did not call for such treatment.  When \nEPA has issued decisions on petitions from individual \nsmall refineries, EPA has recognized that the actions \nare locally or regionally applicable.  See, e.g., Producers \nof Renewables United for Integrity Truth & Transpar-\nency v. EPA, No. 18-1202, Doc. 1775897 (D.C. Cir. Mar. \n4, 2019).  But whichever course EPA chooses in a par-\nticular instance, it is the face of the final action that de-\ntermines the proper venue.  \nRespondents\u2019 position would require the court where \na petition for review is filed to look behind EPA\u2019s char-\nacterization of its own agency action and potentially \nsubstitute a judicial determination of the relevant unit \nof analysis.  But respondents provide little guidance on \nhow courts would make that determination.  Lower \ncourts confronted with such arguments have generally \n\n29 \n \nrejected requests to second-guess EPA\u2019s own framing \nand have focused solely on the face of the final agency \naction.  See, e.g., Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. EPA, 45 F.4th \n380, 387 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (rejecting petitioner\u2019s argu-\nment that EPA\u2019s construction and application to a spe-\ncific context of \u201cnationally applicable provisions of the \nClean Air Act\u201d rendered the agency action itself nation-\nally applicable); Sierra Club v. EPA, 47 F.4th 738, 744 \n(D.C. Cir. 2022) (rejecting petitioner\u2019s argument that \nEPA\u2019s approvals of Texas\u2019s state implementation plans \nwere nationally applicable because EPA had announced \na new understanding that would apply in other loca-\ntions, thereby \u201ceffectively amend[ing] the agency\u2019s na-\ntional implementation regulations\u201d); Southern Ill. Power \nCoop., 863 F.3d at 671 (rejecting petitioner\u2019s argument \nthat EPA\u2019s designations of nonattainment areas were \nan \u201camalgamation of many different locally or region-\nally applicable actions\u201d); RMS of Ga., 64 F.4th at 1374 \n(rejecting petitioner\u2019s argument that an allocation of al-\nlowances among entities should be considered a \u201cdocu-\nment detailing many smaller individual actions\u201d).   \nFocusing on the face of the EPA action has allowed \ncourts and litigants to quickly and efficiently determine \nwhere venue lies, preventing wasteful expenditure of \nresources resolving threshold issues, and furthering \nSection 7607(b)(1)\u2019s purpose of \u201cprioritiz[ing] efficiency.\u201d  \nNational Ass\u2019n of Mfrs. v. Department of Defense, 583 \nU.S. 109, 130 (2018).  Respondents\u2019 approach, by con-\ntrast, would \u201cintroduce[] needless uncertainty into the \ndetermination of venue, where the need for clear rules \nis especially acute.\u201d  Southern Ill. Power Coop., 863 F.3d \nat 673.   \n\n30 \n \nB. The Denial Actions At Issue Here Are Based On Deter-\nminations Of Nationwide Scope Or Effect \nEven if the Court concludes that EPA\u2019s denial ac-\ntions here are \u201clocally or regionally applicable,\u201d those \nactions still are reviewable exclusively in the D.C. Cir-\ncuit.  Those actions are \u201cbased on a determination of na-\ntionwide scope or effect,\u201d and EPA published findings \nto that effect.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).   \n1.  The denial actions at issue here were based on deter-\nminations of nationwide scope \nUnder Section 7607(b)(1), a final action that is \u201clo-\ncally or regionally applicable\u201d is nonetheless reviewable \nin the D.C. Circuit if it is \u201cbased on a determination of \nnationwide scope or effect, and if in taking such action \nthe Administrator finds and publishes that such action \nis based on such a determination.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  \nThere is no dispute that EPA published the requisite \nfindings.  See Pet. App. 12a-13a; see also April Notice, \n87 Fed. Reg. at 24,301; June Notice, 87 Fed. Reg. at \n34,874.  Those findings were correct.   \na. A \u201cdetermination\u201d is a \u201cdecision arrived at or \npromulgated; a determinate sentence, conclusion, or \nopinion.\u201d  4 The Oxford English Dictionary 548 (2d ed. \n1989) (OED); see Webster\u2019s 616 (\u201cthe settling and end-\ning of a controversy esp. by judicial decision\u201d; \u201cthe re-\nsolving of a question by argument or reasoning\u201d).  The \ntext of Section 7607(b)(1) distinguishes between the \nagency\u2019s \u201cfinal action\u201d and the relevant underlying \u201cde-\ntermination.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  A particular EPA \naction may reflect multiple agency determinations, but \nby referring to \u201ca determination of nationwide scope or \neffect,\u201d Section 7607(b)(1) authorizes D.C. Circuit venue \n(if EPA publishes the requisite finding) so long as any \n\n31 \n \nsingle determination of that kind forms the basis of the \naction.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1) (emphasis added).   \nRequiring that the action be \u201c\u200a\u2018based on\u2019\u200a\u201d the rele-\nvant determination ordinarily \u201cindicates a but-for causal \nrelationship and thus a necessary logical condition.\u201d  \nSafeco Ins. Co. of Am. v. Burr, 551 U.S. 47, 63 (2007).  \nEPA\u2019s actions may be\u2014and frequently are\u2014based on \nmultiple determinations, and courts have long accepted \nsuch independent causes as adequate.  See Bostock v. \nClayton County, 590 U.S. 644, 656 (2020) (noting that \n\u201c[o]ften, events have multiple but-for causes\u201d that can \nbe sufficient to trigger liability).  Under \u201cthe traditional \nbut-for causation standard,\u201d causation cannot be de-\nfeated \u201cjust by citing some other factor that contributed \nto [the] challenged  * * *  decision.\u201d  Ibid.  \u201cSo long as\u201d \nthe relevant determination \u201cwas one but-for cause of \nth[e] decision, that is enough to trigger the law.\u201d  Ibid.  \nThus, under Section 7607(b)(1), the relevant determina-\ntions must \u201clie at the core of the agency action\u201d and can-\nnot be \u201c[m]erely peripheral or extraneous.\u201d  Texas v. \nEPA, 829 F.3d 405, 419 (5th Cir. 2016).   \nSection 7607(b)(1) further provides that venue may \nbe appropriate in the D.C. Circuit when the relevant de-\ntermination has \u201cnationwide scope or effect.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n7607(b)(1) (emphasis added).  \u201cScope\u201d means \u201cthe gen-\neral range or extent of cognizance, consideration, activ-\nity, or influence.\u201d  Webster\u2019s 2035; see 14 OED 672 \n(\u201c[R]ange of application or of subjects embraced.\u201d).  \n\u201cEffect\u201d generally means \u201csomething that is produced \nby an agent or cause.\u201d  Webster\u2019s 724; see 5 OED 79 (\u201cTo \nbring about\u201d; \u201cto accomplish\u201d).  When used with respect \nto a statute, \u201ceffect\u201d refers to \u201c[t]he result  * * *  which \na statute will produce upon the existing law.\u201d  Black\u2019s \n462.  Applying that definition in the context of agency \n\n32 \n \naction, the \u201ceffect\u201d of an agency determination refers to \nthe legal consequences that determination produces.  \nThus, Section 7607(b)(1) allows for D.C. Circuit review \nwhen EPA\u2019s final action sets out as a core justification \na principle or conclusion that is intended to govern the \nagency\u2019s decisionmaking in actions throughout the coun-\ntry, or when a central rationale for EPA\u2019s final action \nhas legal consequences for entities beyond a single ju-\ndicial circuit.   \nUnder the third prong of Section 7607(b)(1), a locally \nor regionally applicable action is reviewable in the D.C. \nCircuit only if (a) the action \u201cis based on a determina-\ntion of nationwide scope or effect\u201d and (b) EPA \u201cfinds \nand publishes that such action is based on such a deter-\nmination.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  When EPA publishes \nthe specified finding, a person who seeks review of the \npertinent EPA action may argue that the finding is in-\ncorrect and that venue therefore lies in a regional cir-\ncuit.  In such cases, any disputes about the meaning of \nthe phrase \u201cdetermination of nationwide scope or ef-\nfect\u201d will present questions of statutory interpretation \nthat courts must decide de novo.  See Loper Bright En-\nterprises v. Raimondo, 144 S. Ct. 2244, 2266 (2024).  But \nEPA\u2019s finding that the statutory standard is satisfied \nwith respect to a particular final action ordinarily will be \ngoverned by the arbitrary-and-capricious standard.  See \n5 U.S.C. 706(2)(A) (requiring application of arbitrary-\nand-capricious standard to \u201cagency action, findings, and \nconclusions\u201d); cf. 42 U.S.C. 7607(d)(9) (requiring appli-\ncation of arbitrary-and-capricious standard to particu-\nlar EPA actions).  That deferential standard of review \naccounts for the fact that EPA has obvious knowledge \nand expertise with respect to the centrality of the rele-\nvant \u201cdetermination\u201d to the agency\u2019s own decisionmaking \n\n33 \n \nprocess.  See Marsh v. Oregon Natural Resources Coun-\ncil, 490 U.S. 360, 376-377 (1989) (applying arbitrary-and-\ncapricious review to a \u201cfactual dispute\u201d as to whether \n\u201cnew information undermines conclusions\u201d the agency \nreached because such a question \u201cimplicates substantial \nagency expertise\u201d). \nBy contrast, nothing in the statute requires EPA to \n\u201cfind[] and publish[] that [an] action is based on  * * *  a \ndetermination\u201d of nationwide scope or effect, 42 U.S.C. \n7607(b)(1), even when the facts and law would support \nsuch a finding.  Rather, when EPA declines to publish \nsuch a finding, that decision \u201cis committed to the agency\u2019s \ndiscretion and thus is unreviewable,\u201d Sierra Club, 47 \nF.4th at 745, and it effectively precludes D.C. Circuit \nvenue under Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s third prong.  Thus, for \nany locally or regionally applicable action that is based \non a determination of nationwide scope or effect, Con-\ngress \u201centrusted EPA with discretion to determine the \nproper venue as the agency sees fit.\u201d  Id. at 746; accord \nTexas v. EPA, 983 F.3d 826, 834-835 (5th Cir. 2020).  If \nEPA concludes that a regional circuit is \u201cbest equipped \nto evaluate\u201d a particular agency action based on \u201clocal \nmarket conditions,\u201d Br. in Opp. 21, EPA may decline to \npublish the relevant finding, thereby ensuring that the \nregional circuit will have venue over any challenge to \nthe action. \nb. As EPA correctly found, the denial actions at is-\nsue here were \u201cbased on\u201d two interrelated \u201cdetermina-\ntion[s] of nationwide scope.\u201d  See April Notice, 87 Fed. \nReg. at 24,301; June Notice, 87 Fed. Reg. at 34,874.  \nFirst, the agency adopted a new interpretation of 42 \nU.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(B), construing that provision to re-\nquire that any qualifying hardship \u201cmust be caused by \ncompliance with the RFS program\u201d rather than by \n\n34 \n \nsome unrelated circumstance.  Pet. App. 242a (capitali-\nzation and emphasis altered).  Second, EPA deter-\nmined, as a matter of economic reality, that every refin-\nery recovers the cost of the RIN at the time it sells a \ngallon of fuel.  See id. at 249a.  And because the \u201crefin-\ning and fuel blending markets are highly competitive,\u201d \nEPA found that \u201cRINs are generally widely available in \nan open and liquid market,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he cost of ac-\nquiring RINs is the same for all parties\u201d\u2014features that \n\u201cfacilitate the RIN cost passthrough.\u201d  Ibid.  In light of \nthose two determinations, EPA concluded that, absent \nunusual circumstances, compliance with the RFS pro-\ngram cannot cause disproportionate economic hardship \nto small refineries.   \nAs an interpretation of the statute and an analysis of \nthe national fuels and RIN markets that govern all \nsmall refineries throughout the country seeking exemp-\ntions from the RFS program, EPA\u2019s determinations are \n\u201cnationwide\u201d in scope.  Pet. App. 327a-328a.  That EPA \nadopted and applied those determinations uniformly to \nsmall refineries across the country is evidence of that \nfact.  Those core determinations played a decisive role \nin EPA\u2019s denial actions, leading EPA to presume that \nthe petitioning small refineries across the country had \nnot experienced disproportionate economic hardship\u2014\na presumption that EPA concluded no individual refin-\neries had succeeded in rebutting.  See id. at 15a.  And \nthose determinations were essential to the validity of \nthe challenged denial actions, such that judicial rejec-\ntion of either determination would provide a sufficient \nbasis for reversing the actions.5 \n \n5  Under the RFS program, EPA establishes percentage stand-\nards each year that all obligated parties must use to satisfy their \n \n\n35 \n \nIndeed, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s ultimate merits disposi-\ntion of the petitions for review here confirms that the \nchallenged denial actions were \u201cbased on\u201d the statutory \ninterpretation and economic analysis described above.  \nIn this case the Fifth Circuit, having concluded that \nEPA\u2019s statutory interpretation was inconsistent with \nthe CAA\u2019s text (Pet. App. 23a-27a) and that \u201cEPA\u2019s \nRIN-passthrough theory [was] contrary to the evi-\ndence\u201d (id. at 30a; see id. at 29a-33a), granted the peti-\ntions for review and vacated the denial actions.  See id. \nat 34a.  If judicial invalidation of the relevant determi-\nnation would provide a sufficient basis for finding the \nfinal action itself to be \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse \nof discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,\u201d \n42 U.S.C. 7607(d)(9)(A); 5 U.S.C. 706(2), then the deter-\nmination is properly viewed as \u201ca necessary logical con-\ndition\u201d of the action, Safeco, 551 U.S. at 63, and the req-\nuisite causal relationship exists.  \nc. The statutory history confirms that Congress in-\ntended for final actions like those at issue here to be \nsubject to review in the D.C. Circuit.   \n \nportion of the nationwide target volumes, see p. 4, supra.  When \nEPA anticipates granting an exemption petition at the time it estab-\nlishes the percentage standard, it accounts for that exemption by \nshifting the pro rata burden to other obligated parties.  See Pet. \nApp. 248a & n.139.  If EPA later grants an exemption it did not an-\nticipate, the result is that the national target volumes will not be \nreached for that year.  See id. at 246a & n.135.  EPA\u2019s exemption \ndecisions thus implicate the legal obligations of all non-exempt re-\nfineries across the country.  That reality further underscores the \nneed for nationwide uniformity, and thus the appropriateness of \nD.C. Circuit review, which ensures that uniform standards will ap-\nply and that no refinery will receive a competitive advantage based \non the happenstance of the circuit in which it is located. \n\n36 \n \nBefore Congress amended the venue provision to au-\nthorize D.C. Circuit review of locally or regionally ap-\nplicable actions with nationwide scope or effect, the \n1970 statute made the approval or promulgation of state \nor federal plans reviewable in \u201cthe appropriate circuit.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. 1857h-5(b)(1) (1970).  Disputes concerning \nthat language spawned protracted litigation.  See David \nP. Currie, Judicial Review Under Federal Pollution \nLaws, 62 Iowa L. Rev. 1221, 1262-1269 (1977) (Currie).  \nParties faced a lack of clarity as to which circuit was \n\u201cthe appropriate circuit\u201d when a petitioner challenged a \nfinal action pertaining to state implementation plans \nsubmitted by multiple states spanning multiple judicial \ncircuits.  Id. at 1264.   \nIn light of that uncertainty, one petitioner filed iden-\ntical petitions in ten regional circuits, with an eleventh \nin the D.C. Circuit, and then asked each of the regional \ncircuits to transfer the case to the D.C. Circuit for res-\nolution.  Currie 1263.  Five courts of appeals agreed to \ndo so, while the other five stayed proceedings pending \nthe disposition of the D.C. Circuit case.  Ibid.  Each of \nthe petitions challenged an EPA action that had ap-\nproved numerous state implementation plans based on \nthe agency\u2019s determination that the attainment dead-\nlines for certain pollutants should be extended because \nnecessary control measures would not be available in \nthe time otherwise prescribed.  See Natural Resources \nDefense Council v. EPA, 475 F.2d 968, 969-970 (D.C. \nCir. 1973) (per curiam). \nIn an opinion approving a transfer and finding the \nD.C. Circuit to be \u201cthe appropriate circuit,\u201d the First \nCircuit explained that \u201c[t]he legal issues raised by peti-\ntioners in the\u201d various pending cases \u201cseem[ed] to be \nidentical,\u201d and that \u201clitigation in several circuits, with \n\n37 \n \npossible delayed results on the merits, can only serve to \nfrustrate the strong Congressional interest in improv-\ning the environment.\u201d  Natural Resources Defense \nCouncil v. EPA, 465 F.2d 492, 494 (1st Cir. 1972) (per \ncuriam).  The D.C. Circuit agreed, explaining that \n\u201c[n]one of the[] issues\u201d raised by the petitions \u201cinvolve \nfacts or laws peculiar to any one jurisdiction; rather, all \nconcern uniform determinations of nationwide effect \nmade by the Administrator.\u201d  Natural Resources De-\nfense Council, 475 F.2d at 970.   \nIn 1976, the Administrative Conference of the United \nStates (ACUS) drafted recommendations for amending \nand clarifying the CAA venue provision.  41 Fed. Reg. \nat 56,767.  ACUS urged Congress to \u201cclarify[] that the \nappropriate circuit is the one containing the state whose \nplan is challenged.\u201d  Ibid.  EPA General Counsel G. Wil-\nliam Frick provided additional views, however, and \ncounseled that \u201cwhere \u2018national issues\u2019 are involved \nthey should be reviewed in the D.C. Circuit.\u201d  Id. at \n56,768.  Frick noted that, although EPA actions involv-\ning state implementation plans \u201cusually involve issues \npeculiar to the affected States, such actions sometimes \ninvolve generic determinations of nationwide scope or \neffect.\u201d  Id. at 56,768-56,769.  In Frick\u2019s view, \u201cCongress \nintended review in the D.C. Circuit of \u2018matters on which \nnational uniformity is desirable\u2019\u200a\u201d because of \u201cthe D.C. \nCircuit\u2019s obvious expertise in administrative law mat-\nters\u201d and its familiarity with the CAA\u2019s \u201ccomplex\u201d text \nand history.  Id. at 56,769.  Citing the Natural Re-\nsources Defense Council cases as illustrative, Frick ex-\nplained that it \u201cmakes sense to centralize review of \u2018na-\ntional\u2019 [state implementation plan] issues in the D.C. \nCircuit, taking advantage of its administrative law ex-\npertise and facilitating an orderly development of the \n\n38 \n \nbasic law under the Act, rather than to have such issues \ndecided separately by a number of courts.\u201d  Ibid. \nBy authorizing D.C. Circuit review of final EPA ac-\ntions that are based on \u201cdetermination[s] of nationwide \nscope or effect,\u201d the 1977 amendments incorporated \nFrick\u2019s own language.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1); see 41 Fed. \nReg. at 56,768-56,769.  The House Report that accompa-\nnied the 1977 amendments \u201cconcur[red]\u201d with Frick\u2019s \n\u201ccomments, concerns, and recommendation.\u201d  1977 House \nReport 324.  That history reflects Congress\u2019s awareness \nthat, even when a particular EPA action specifically ad-\ndresses a single State, region, or entity, judicial review \nof the action may implicate national concerns.  After \nconsidering the competing viewpoints expressed by \nACUS and Frick as to the proper means of resolving \nthose national issues, Congress opted to authorize uni-\nform resolution by providing a mechanism for exclusive \nD.C. Circuit review.  \n2.  The court of appeals\u2019 and respondents\u2019 contrary rea-\nsoning would render the \u201cnationwide scope or effect\u201d \nprong of Section 7607(b)(1) practically insignificant \nThe court of appeals and respondents have largely \nignored the determinations of nationwide scope or ef-\nfect that EPA identified.  The court and respondents \nhave focused instead on the refinery-specific circum-\nstances that EPA also considered in the course of de-\ntermining whether individual refineries could rebut the \npresumption the agency had established.  That myopic \napproach is inconsistent with the statutory text and \nwould severely undercut the intended reach of the third \nprong of Section 7607(b)(1).  Under the correct inter-\npretation of the statute, that prong has both meaningful \nreach and meaningful limits, each designed to further \nCongress\u2019s purpose of channeling to the D.C. Circuit \n\n39 \n \nthose challenges that are likely to raise issues of na-\ntional importance.   \na. The Fifth Circuit erred in rejecting EPA\u2019s finding \nthat the denial actions are based on determinations of \nnationwide scope or effect.  The court stated that EPA\u2019s \nstatutory interpretation and economic analysis\u2014\u201cwithout \nmore\u201d\u2014\u201cfail to provide the agency with a sufficient ba-\nsis to adjudicate exemption petitions.\u201d  Pet. App. 15a.  \nThe court observed that, in ruling on a specific exemp-\ntion request, EPA must examine \u201crefinery-specific\u201d \nfacts to ensure that local circumstances do not warrant \na departure from the agency\u2019s general economic analy-\nsis.  Ibid.  Respondents likewise emphasize (Br. in Opp. \n23) that EPA considered \u201clocal facts and data\u201d in deter-\nmining that the refineries\u2019 exemption requests should \nbe denied. \nIn treating that aspect of EPA\u2019s methodology as de-\ncisive, the court and respondents would effectively limit \nD.C. Circuit venue under Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s third \nprong to review of EPA actions that are based solely on \ndeterminations of nationwide scope or effect.  Nothing \nin the statutory text supports that approach.  Where \nCongress intended to require such a limitation, it said \nso explicitly.  See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1) (providing \nan exception to the statute\u2019s 60-day filing window where \nthe \u201cpetition is based solely on grounds arising after\u201d \nthat time period expires) (emphasis added); cf. Bostock, \n590 U.S. at 656 (\u201cAs it has in other statutes, [Congress] \ncould have added \u2018solely\u2019 to indicate that actions taken \n\u2018because of\u200a\u2019 the confluence of multiple factors do not vi-\nolate the law.\u201d).  And this approach would effectively \npreclude application of Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s third prong \nto adjudications, which by their nature involve discrete \n\n40 \n \nparties and virtually always implicate at least some \nparty-specific facts and judgments.  Cf. p. 25, supra.   \nMore fundamentally, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s approach \nwould largely drain the \u201cnationwide scope or effect\u201d \nprong of any practical significance.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  \nBy its terms, Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s third prong applies \nonly to actions that are \u201clocally or regionally applica-\nble.\u201d  Ibid.  Nearly all such actions can be expected to \nrest at least in part on consideration of local or regional \ncircumstances.  Yet on the Fifth Circuit\u2019s view, EPA\u2019s \nconsideration of such circumstances as one aspect of its \nanalysis suffices to preclude application of Section \n7607(b)(1)\u2019s third prong.   \nAs explained above (see pp. 37-38, supra), Congress \nenacted Section 7607(b)(1) in its current form after \nEPA\u2019s then-General Counsel highlighted the fact that \nEPA\u2019s approval and promulgation of implementation \nplans for individual States, which will necessarily rest \nat least in part on State-specific circumstances, can also \nraise issues of national significance for which D.C. Cir-\ncuit review is appropriate.  See 41 Fed. Reg. at 56,769.  \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision thus contravenes Con-\ngress\u2019s purpose of centralizing review of national issues \nin the D.C. Circuit and prioritizing the efficient resolu-\ntion of those issues, even when the actions also address \nlocal or regional concerns.  See Pet. App. 43a (Hig-\nginbotham, J., dissenting).   \nb. Respondents also contend that, because \u201cEPA in \nevery action [must] apply a uniform approach to simi-\nlarly affected parties,\u201d adopting the government\u2019s in-\nterpretation would allow D.C. Circuit venue for chal-\nlenges to every locally or regionally applicable EPA ac-\ntion.  Br. in Opp. 25-26.  That is incorrect.  The statutory \n\n41 \n \ntext includes significant limitations that would prevent \nthat result.   \ni. As an initial matter, the relevant language in Sec-\ntion 7607(b)(1) imposes a causation requirement, au-\nthorizing D.C. Circuit venue only when the challenged \nagency action is \u201cbased on a determination of nation-\nwide scope or effect.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1) (emphasis \nadded).  See pp. 30-31, supra.  EPA\u2019s finding that such \na standard is satisfied is subject to arbitrary-and- \ncapricious review.  See p. 32, supra.  That causation re-\nquirement ensures that D.C. Circuit review will be \navailable only if the relevant determinations are at the \ncore of EPA\u2019s action.  For the reasons already ex-\nplained, ibid., that causation requirement is satisfied \nhere\u2014but it will not be satisfied for every EPA action. \nii. The word \u201cdetermination\u201d suggests a resolution \nof an unsettled issue.  See Webster\u2019s 616 (\u201cthe settling \nand ending of a controversy esp. by judicial decision\u201d).  \nOn that understanding, EPA does not make a \u201cdetermi-\nnation of nationwide scope\u201d when it merely applies a \npreviously established agency rule, policy, or interpre-\ntation to new \u201clocally or regionally applicable\u201d circum-\nstances, even if EPA has previously expressed its intent \nthat the relevant agency rule or policy will apply nation-\nwide.  In deciding whether an EPA rule or policy con-\nstitutes a \u201cdetermination\u201d when the agency applies it in \ntaking a new action, the court may consider whether \nEPA announced the rule or policy at roughly the same \ntime as the challenged agency action itself.  The court \nmay also consider whether the participants in any  \nnotice-and-comment period or comparable agency pro-\nceeding leading up to the challenged action contested \nthe validity of the rule or policy. \n\n42 \n \nThat approach reflects a textually reasonable under-\nstanding of the statutory term \u201cdetermination,\u201d and it \nwould further the congressional policy judgments re-\nflected in the second and third prongs of Section \n7607(b)(1).  The vast majority of \u201clocally or regionally \napplicable\u201d EPA actions reflect the application of some \nnationwide agency rule, policy, or interpretation to a \nfactual setting that is confined to a single judicial cir-\ncuit.  When the circumstances suggest that the rule, pol-\nicy, or interpretation itself is likely to be called into \nquestion in any judicial challenge to the EPA action, \nrouting such challenges to the D.C. Circuit serves im-\nportant interests in judicial efficiency and nationwide \nuniformity.  That is particularly so if the relevant EPA \ndetermination is intended to govern future agency ac-\ntions.  But where the validity of the general rule or pol-\nicy appears to be settled, such that any judicial chal-\nlenges to the action are likely to focus on the application \nof the general pronouncement to discrete local facts, \nthose interests are inapposite. \nHere, EPA\u2019s new statutory interpretation and eco-\nnomic analysis were announced at roughly the same \ntime as, and were intended to guide, the denial actions \nthemselves.  Comments on the proposed denial actions \ndisputed the validity of the interpretation and analysis.  \nSee C.A. App. 96-144, 242-290 (summarizing and re-\nsponding to comments).  The interpretation and analy-\nsis therefore are properly viewed as EPA \u201cdetermina-\ntion[s]\u201d within the meaning of Section 7607(b)(1), rather \nthan as the application of settled nationwide principles \nto new factual settings.6 \n \n6  Respondents have contended (Br. in Opp. 29) that EPA\u2019s April \nand June 2022 denial actions raise distinct venue issues because the \n \n\n43 \n \niii. As explained above, a locally or regionally appli-\ncable EPA action is reviewable in the D.C. Circuit only \nif (a) the action \u201cis based on a determination of nation-\nwide scope or effect\u201d and (b) EPA \u201cfinds and publishes \nthat such action is based on such a determination.\u201d  42 \nU.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  Even when the facts and law would \nsupport the specified finding, EPA has plenary discre-\ntion to decide whether to publish that finding, and the \nagency \u201cmay weigh any number of considerations\u201d in \nmaking that decision.  Sierra Club, 47 F.4th at 746; see \np. 33, supra.  For example, EPA may consider whether \nany petitions for review of a particular action would \nlikely contest EPA determinations of national concern, \nor instead would likely dispute EPA\u2019s understanding of \nlocal or regional circumstances.  For EPA actions in the \nlatter category, the agency may decline to publish the \nrelevant finding, thereby ensuring that the regional cir-\ncuit will have venue over any challenge to the action.   \nc. The limitations described above meaningfully \nconstrain the number of locally or regionally applicable \nactions that will be subject to D.C. Circuit review, while \nfurthering the congressional purpose embodied in Sec-\ntion 7607(b)(1) to promote efficient and uniform resolu-\n \nApril denial action announced a new approach to small-refinery ex-\nemptions, while the June denial action simply applied that approach \nto additional refineries.  That contention is overstated.  Both denial \nactions here stemmed from a single proposed denial that first an-\nnounced EPA\u2019s new approach to exemptions.  Pet. App. 48a, 193a; \nsee 86 Fed. Reg. at 70,999 (proposing to \u201cdeny all pending [exemp-\ntion] petitions\u201d based on the agency\u2019s determinations regarding the \nmeaning of disproportionate economic hardship and the market re-\nalities of refinery operations).  The fact that a short time passed be-\ntween the finalization of the two actions\u2014without any court consid-\nering the validity of EPA\u2019s new determinations\u2014is an insufficient \nbasis to distinguish between the actions for purposes of venue.  \n\n44 \n \ntion of disputed issues of national significance.  By con-\ntrast, respondents\u2019 interpretation would limit D.C. Cir-\ncuit review of locally or regionally applicable EPA ac-\ntions to a vanishingly small category.  Embracing that \ninterpretation would lead to the very problems Con-\ngress sought to avoid in amending the CAA\u2019s venue pro-\nvision to include the nationwide-scope-or-effect lan-\nguage.   \nThis case is illustrative.  As a result of the Fifth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s refusal to transfer this case, EPA now faces two \nmerits decisions from two different circuit courts that \naddressed substantially similar challenges to the same \ndenial actions.  The petitioners in both circuits focused \ntheir attacks on the statutory interpretation and eco-\nnomic analysis that EPA had adopted and applied na-\ntionwide, not on any refinery-specific EPA findings.  \nAnd EPA avoided further fragmentation of judicial re-\nview only because five other regional courts of appeals \ndismissed similar challenges for improper venue or \ntransferred challenges to the D.C. Circuit.     \nAlthough both the Fifth and D.C. Circuits ultimately \nvacated EPA\u2019s denial actions, the differences in reason-\ning between the two circuits may lead to different re-\nsults on remand.7  That would create a bifurcated RFS \n \n7  Most notably, the Fifth Circuit found that refineries had reason-\nably relied on EPA\u2019s prior approach to adjudicating exemption pe-\ntitions, such that the agency\u2019s consideration of updated economic in-\nformation regarding RFS compliance costs\u2014relating to the \u201cRIN \ncost passthrough principle\u201d\u2014created an impermissible retroactive \neffect.  Pet. App. 14a; see id. at 16a-23a.  The D.C. Circuit declined \nto reach that issue.  See Sinclair Wyoming Ref. Co. v. EPA, 114 \nF.4th 693, 714 n.12 (2024) (per curiam).  Under the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \nretroactivity analysis, EPA would be required to evaluate the re-\nmanded petitions under its prior approach, without considering up-\n \n\n45 \n \nprogram consisting of one program for remanded peti-\ntions for most of the nation, and a separate, more favor-\nable program for exemption claimants in the Fifth Cir-\ncuit.  That result is contrary to Congress\u2019s direction to \nensure a uniform, nationwide framework for increasing \nrenewable fuel use, see e.g., 42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(2)(A)(i) \nand (o)(2)(B)(ii)(III), and with Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s evi-\ndent purpose of ensuring efficient, uniform resolution of \nissues with national significance.  And if this Court en-\ndorses the Fifth Circuit\u2019s venue analysis, future EPA \nactions similar to the denial actions here can be ex-\npected to spawn litigation in several courts of appeals, \nwith a consequent increased waste of judicial resources \nand a heightened risk of inconsistent outcomes.  Noth-\ning in the statutory text requires that result, and the \nCourt should reject it.   \n \n \n \ndated economic analysis of a small refinery\u2019s compliance costs be-\nyond those contemplated by the DOE study and corresponding \nscoring matrix.  That aspect of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s opinion focuses \nnot on any refinery-specific circumstance, but on the economic anal-\nysis EPA used in assessing exemption petitions from refineries na-\ntionwide.  Under the D.C. Circuit\u2019s analysis, by contrast, EPA may \nconsider any updated economic information about a small refinery\u2019s \ncompliance costs that is relevant to assessing whether the refinery \nactually suffers disproportionate economic hardship. \n\n46 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThis Court should vacate the order of the court of \nappeals and remand with instructions to transfer the \ncase to the D.C. Circuit.   \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nDIMPLE CHAUDHARY \nActing General Counsel \nSUSANNAH WEAVER \nDeputy General Counsel \nGAUTAM SRINIVASAN \nAssociate General Counsel \nMATTHEW MARKS \nDeputy Associate General \nCounsel \nSUSAN STAHLE \nJEANHEE HONG \nAttorneys \nEnvironmental Protection \nAgency \n \nELIZABETH B.

The specified 20 percent reduction in \ngreenhouse gas emissions from renewable fuel \nmay not be reduced below 10 percent, and the \nspecified 60 percent reduction in greenhouse gas \nemissions from cellulosic biofuel may not be re-\nduced below 50 percent. \n \n(C) \nAdjusted reduction levels \n \nAn adjustment under this paragraph to a per-\ncent less than the specified 20 percent greenhouse \ngas reduction for renewable fuel shall be the min-\nimum possible adjustment, and the adjusted \ngreenhouse gas reduction shall be established by \nthe Administrator at the maximum achievable \nlevel, taking cost in consideration, for natural gas \nfired corn-based ethanol plants, allowing for the \nuse of a variety of technologies and processes.  \nAn adjustment in the 50 or 60 percent greenhouse \ngas levels shall be the minimum possible adjust-\nment for the fuel or fuels concerned, and the ad-\njusted greenhouse gas reduction shall be estab-\nlished at the maximum achievable level, taking \ncost in consideration, allowing for the use of a va-\nriety of feedstocks, technologies, and processes. \n \n \n \n \n\n17a \n \n \n(D) \n5-year review \n \nWhenever the Administrator makes any ad-\njustment under this paragraph, not later than 5 \nyears thereafter he shall review and revise (based \nupon the same criteria and standards as required \nfor the initial adjustment) the regulations estab-\nlishing the adjusted level. \n \n(E) \nSubsequent adjustments \n \nAfter the Administrator has promulgated a fi-\nnal rule under the last sentence of paragraph \n(2)(A)(i) with respect to the method of determin-\ning lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions, except as \nprovided in subparagraph (D), the Administrator \nmay not adjust the percent greenhouse gas reduc-\ntion levels unless he determines that there has \nbeen a significant change in the analytical meth-\nodology used for determining the lifecycle green-\nhouse gas emissions.  If he makes such determi-\nnation, he may adjust the 20, 50, or 60 percent re-\nduction levels through rulemaking using the crite-\nria and standards set forth in this paragraph. \n \n(F) \nLimit on upward adjustments \n \nIf, under subparagraph (D) or (E), the Admin-\nistrator revises a percent level adjusted as pro-\nvided in subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) to a \nhigher percent, such higher percent may not ex-\nceed the applicable percent specified in paragraph \n(2)(A)(i), (1)(D), (1)(B)(i), or (1)(E). \n \n(G) \nApplicability of adjustments \n \nIf the Administrator adjusts, or revises, a per-\ncent level referred to in this paragraph or makes \n\n18a \n \na change in the analytical methodology used for \ndetermining the lifecycle greenhouse gas emis-\nsions, such adjustment, revision, or change (or any \ncombination thereof\u200a) shall only apply to renewa-\nble fuel from new facilities that commence con-\nstruction after the effective date of such adjust-\nment, revision, or change. \n(5) Credit program \n \n(A) \nIn general \n \nThe regulations promulgated under paragraph \n(2)(A) shall provide\u2014 \n \n(i) \nfor the generation of an appropriate \namount of credits by any person that refines, \nblends, or imports gasoline that contains a \nquantity of renewable fuel that is greater than \nthe quantity required under paragraph (2); \n \n(ii) for the generation of an appropriate \namount of credits for biodiesel; and \n \n(iii) for the generation of credits by small \nrefineries in accordance with paragraph (9)(C). \n \n(B) \nUse of credits \n \nA person that generates credits under subpar-\nagraph (A) may use the credits, or transfer all or \na portion of the credits to another person, for the \npurpose of complying with paragraph (2). \n \n(C) \nDuration of credits \n \nA credit generated under this paragraph shall \nbe valid to show compliance for the 12 months as \nof the date of generation. \n\n19a \n \n \n(D) \nInability to generate or purchase sufficient \ncredits \n \nThe regulations promulgated under paragraph \n(2)(A) shall include provisions allowing any person \nthat is unable to generate or purchase sufficient \ncredits to meet the requirements of paragraph (2) \nto carry forward a renewable fuel deficit on condi-\ntion that the person, in the calendar year following \nthe year in which the renewable fuel deficit is  \ncreated\u2014 \n \n(i) \nachieves compliance with the renewa-\nble fuel requirement under paragraph (2); and \n \n(ii) generates or purchases additional re-\nnewable fuel credits to offset the renewable \nfuel deficit of the previous year. \n \n(E) \nCredits for additional renewable fuel \n \nThe Administrator may issue regulations \nproviding:  (i) for the generation of an appropri-\nate amount of credits by any person that refines, \nblends, or imports additional renewable fuels \nspecified by the Administrator; and (ii) for the use \nof such credits by the generator, or the transfer of \nall or a portion of the credits to another person, \nfor the purpose of complying with paragraph (2). \n(6) Seasonal variations in renewable fuel use \n \n(A) \nStudy \n \nFor each of calendar years 2006 through 2012, \nthe Administrator of the Energy Information Ad-\nministration shall conduct a study of renewable \nfuel blending to determine whether there are ex-\n\n20a \n \ncessive seasonal variations in the use of renewable \nfuel. \n \n(B) \nRegulation of excessive seasonal variations \n \nIf, for any calendar year, the Administrator of \nthe Energy Information Administration, based on \nthe study under subparagraph (A), makes the de-\nterminations specified in subparagraph (C), the \nAdministrator of the Environmental Protection \nAgency shall promulgate regulations to ensure \nthat 25 percent or more of the quantity of renew-\nable fuel necessary to meet the requirements of \nparagraph (2) is used during each of the 2 periods \nspecified in subparagraph (D) of each subsequent \ncalendar year. \n \n(C) \nDeterminations \n \nThe determinations referred to in subpara-\ngraph (B) are that\u2014 \n \n(i) \nless than 25 percent of the quantity of \nrenewable fuel necessary to meet the require-\nments of paragraph (2) has been used during 1 \nof the 2 periods specified in subparagraph (D) \nof the calendar year; \n \n(ii) a pattern of excessive seasonal varia-\ntion described in clause (i) will continue in sub-\nsequent calendar years; and \n \n(iii) promulgating regulations or other re-\nquirements to impose a 25 percent or more sea-\nsonal use of renewable fuels will not prevent or \ninterfere with the attainment of national ambi-\nent air quality standards or significantly in-\ncrease the price of motor fuels to the consumer. \n\n21a \n \n \n(D) \nPeriods \n \nThe 2 periods referred to in this paragraph \nare\u2014 \n \n \n \n(i) \nApril through September; and \n \n(ii) January through March and October \nthrough December. \n \n(E) \nExclusion \n \nRenewable fuel blended or consumed in calen-\ndar year 2006 in a State that has received a waiver \nunder section 7543(b) of this title shall not be in-\ncluded in the study under subparagraph (A). \n \n(F) \nState exemption from seasonality require-\nments \n \nNotwithstanding any other provision of law, \nthe seasonality requirement relating to renewable \nfuel use established by this paragraph shall not \napply to any State that has received a waiver un-\nder section 7543(b) of this title or any State de-\npendent on refineries in such State for gasoline \nsupplies. \n(7) Waivers \n \n(A) \nIn general \n \nThe Administrator, in consultation with the \nSecretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of En-\nergy, may waive the requirements of paragraph \n(2) in whole or in part on petition by one or more \nStates, by any person subject to the requirements \nof this subsection, or by the Administrator on his \nown motion by reducing the national quantity of \nrenewable fuel required under paragraph (2)\u2014 \n\n22a \n \n \n(i) \nbased on a determination by the Ad-\nministrator, after public notice and opportunity \nfor comment, that implementation of the re-\nquirement would severely harm the economy \nor environment of a State, a region, or the \nUnited States; or \n \n(ii) based on a determination by the Ad-\nministrator, after public notice and opportunity \nfor comment, that there is an inadequate do-\nmestic supply. \n \n(B) \nPetitions for waivers \n \nThe Administrator, in consultation with the \nSecretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of En-\nergy, shall approve or disapprove a petition for a \nwaiver of the requirements of paragraph (2) \nwithin 90 days after the date on which the petition \nis received by the Administrator. \n \n(C) \nTermination of waivers \n \nA waiver granted under subparagraph (A) shall \nterminate after 1 year, but may be renewed by the \nAdministrator after consultation with the Secre-\ntary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Energy. \n \n(D) \nCellulosic biofuel \n \n(i) \nFor any calendar year for which the pro-\njected volume of cellulosic biofuel production is \nless than the minimum applicable volume estab-\nlished under paragraph (2)(B), as determined by \nthe Administrator based on the estimate provided \nunder paragraph (3)(A), not later than November \n30 of the preceding calendar year, the Administra-\ntor shall reduce the applicable volume of cellulosic \n\n23a \n \nbiofuel required under paragraph (2)(B) to the \nprojected volume available during that calendar \nyear.  For any calendar year in which the Admin-\nistrator makes such a reduction, the Administra-\ntor may also reduce the applicable volume of re-\nnewable fuel and advanced biofuels requirement \nestablished under paragraph (2)(B) by the same or \na lesser volume. \n \n(ii) Whenever the Administrator reduces the \nminimum cellulosic biofuel volume under this sub-\nparagraph, the Administrator shall make availa-\nble for sale cellulosic biofuel credits at the higher \nof $0.25 per gallon or the amount by which $3.00 \nper gallon exceeds the average wholesale price of \na gallon of gasoline in the United States.  Such \namounts shall be adjusted for inflation by the Ad-\nministrator for years after 2008. \n \n(iii) Eighteen months after December 19, 2007, \nthe Administrator shall promulgate regulations to \ngovern the issuance of credits under this subpara-\ngraph.  The regulations shall set forth the \nmethod for determining the exact price of credits \nin the event of a waiver.  The price of such credits \nshall not be changed more frequently than once \neach quarter.  These regulations shall include \nsuch provisions, including limiting the credits\u2019 \nuses and useful life, as the Administrator deems \nappropriate to assist market liquidity and trans-\nparency, to provide appropriate certainty for reg-\nulated entities and renewable fuel producers, and \nto limit any potential misuse of cellulosic biofuel \ncredits to reduce the use of other renewable fuels, \nand for such other purposes as the Administrator \n\n24a \n \ndetermines will help achieve the goals of this sub-\nsection.  The regulations shall limit the number \nof cellulosic biofuel credits for any calendar year \nto the minimum applicable volume (as reduced un-\nder this subparagraph) of cellulosic biofuel for \nthat year. \n \n(E) \nBiomass-based diesel \n \n \n(i) \nMarket evaluation \n \nThe Administrator, in consultation with the \nSecretary of Energy and the Secretary of Ag-\nriculture, shall periodically evaluate the impact \nof the biomass-based diesel requirements es-\ntablished under this paragraph on the price of \ndiesel fuel. \n \n \n(ii) \nWaiver \n \nIf the Administrator determines that there \nis a significant renewable feedstock disruption \nor other market circumstances that would \nmake the price of biomass-based diesel fuel in-\ncrease significantly, the Administrator, in con-\nsultation with the Secretary of Energy and the \nSecretary of Agriculture, shall issue an order \nto reduce, for up to a 60-day period, the quan-\ntity of biomass-based diesel required under \nsubparagraph (A) by an appropriate quantity \nthat does not exceed 15 percent of the applica-\nble annual requirement for biomass-based die-\nsel.

The respondent's brief is the primary document that will articulate the counterarguments to the petitioner's (EPA's) claim that these actions are 'nationally applicable'. To predict the Court's ruling on this jurisdictional question, it is essential to understand the respondent's statutory interpretation and their arguments for why these individual adjudications fall outside the D.C. Circuit's exclusive jurisdiction. This information is fundamental to modeling the legal reasoning of the justices and is not duplicative of information likely already gathered.\n\nDesign EIG is moderate (0.5) because this action reinforces a core, effective strategy for SCOTUS prediction: systematically gathering and analyzing the principal briefs from both parties. While not a novel strategy, confirming the high value of this step provides strong positive feedback for a well-structured analytical process. It demonstrates the importance of building a complete, adversarial picture of the legal arguments before attempting a prediction, which is a key design principle for this agent.",

The six small refinery re-\nspondents here separately petitioned EPA for hardship \nexemptions for particular compliance years. EPA con-\ncluded, after \u201cconsider[ing] each [respondent\u2019s] individual \nrefinery information,\u201d that each of the respondents was \nnot entitled to hardship relief and denied the petitions. \nPet.App.14a-15a. Respondents then petitioned for judicial \nreview as permitted by the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1). The question presented is:  \nWhether an EPA decision denying a small refinery\u2019s \nRFS hardship petition is a \u201clocally or regionally applica-\nble\u201d action, such that a court challenge to that action is \nproperly venued in a regional circuit court, or is instead a \n\u201cnationally applicable\u201d action or an action \u201cbased on a  \ndetermination of nationwide scope or effect\u201d that must be \nchallenged only in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. \nCircuit. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). \n \n \n\n \nii \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nStatutory Provision Involved ............................................. 1 \nIntroduction ......................................................................... 3 \nStatement ............................................................................. 6 \nA.

Notwithstanding the preceding sentence a petition \nfor review of any action referred to in such sentence may \nbe filed only in the United States Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia if such action is based on a determi-\nnation of nationwide scope or effect and if in taking such \naction the Administrator finds and publishes that such  \naction is based on such a determination. \n* \nThis and other pertinent statutory provisions are  \nreprinted in the appendix to this brief. App.1a-31a, infra. \n \n \n\n \n3 \nINTRODUCTION \nThe Clean Air Act (\u201cCAA\u201d or \u201cAct\u201d) assigns the venue \nfor a petition for judicial review of final agency action by \nasking whether the challenged action is \u201cnationally appli-\ncable\u201d (reviewed by the D.C. Circuit) or \u201clocally or region-\nally applicable\u201d (reviewed by the regional circuit courts). \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1).1 Determining venue thus requires \nfocusing with precision on the \u201caction\u201d that the Environ-\nmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) was authorized by the \nCAA to take: the \u201cfinal action taken \u2026 under this chap-\nter.\u201d Ibid. (\u201c[T]his chapter\u201d is the CAA.) \nOnce the final action is properly identified, the venue \nprovision is straightforward. Most EPA actions under the \nAct are rulemakings or similar actions that apply through-\nout the entire nation, or else are adjudications or similar \ndecisions involving individual States or regulated entities. \nThe former go to the D.C. Circuit, the latter to the re-\ngional circuit courts\u2014save only in the exceptional circum-\nstance where the CAA\u2019s text directs EPA to base a local \naction on a \u201cdetermination\u201d about the whole nation. \nApplying those statutory instructions here shows why \nthe Fifth Circuit below got the venue question right. This \ncase concerns a type of statutory forbearance from the \nCAA\u2019s Renewable Fuel Standard (\u201cRFS\u201d) that affects \nonly small refineries. Small refineries like respondents \nmay petition EPA for an exemption from the RFS obliga-\ntion by showing that they will face disproportionate eco-\nnomic hardship from compliance with the RFS in a given \nyear. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(A)-(B). Until a presidential administra-\ntion change in 2021, EPA had repeatedly acknowledged \nthat its decisions on small refineries\u2019 hardship petitions \n \n1  All statutory citations are to Title 42 of the United States \nCode. \n\n \n4 \nare quintessential locally applicable actions that Section \n7607(b)(1) refers to the regional circuits. That\u2019s because \neach EPA \u201cfinal action\u201d on a hardship-exemption petition \nadjudicates the rights of only one small refinery located in \none place, and the \u201cchapter\u201d (the CAA) requires those ac-\ntions to be based on consideration of each small refinery\u2019s \nown economic hardship. \u00a7 7607(b)(1); see \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B). \nEPA changed its position on venue and started delib-\nerately attempting to re-direct judicial challenges to its \npreferred court, the D.C. Circuit, only after it suffered a \nstring of defeats in regional circuit courts that found EPA \nhad wrongly decided hardship petitions. EPA now argues \nthat, because it published its decisions on multiple small \nrefineries\u2019 pending hardship petitions bundled together in \ntwo explanation documents (denying every pending peti-\ntion), it was able to convert what it has long agreed were \nlocally applicable final actions into just two nationally  \napplicable actions. EPA was transparent about its goal of \nmaking the D.C. Circuit the only court allowed to review \nits latest denial decisions. \nEPA\u2019s new venue position is contrary to the CAA\u2019s \ntext, and the Fifth Circuit correctly rejected it. EPA was \nable to produce the bundled decisions only by ignoring the \nstatutory command to decide hardship petitions individu-\nally as they come in. More fundamentally, the two expla-\nnation documents were bundles of individual final actions \nunder the CAA. EPA\u2019s choice about how to publish its  \ndecisions cannot change the nature of the \u201cfinal action \ntaken \u2026 under this chapter,\u201d which is what matters for \nvenue. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). It is the statutory text\u2014\u201cth[e] chap-\nter\u201d\u2014that establishes what actions EPA is permitted to \ntake. And here, every relevant provision of the chapter \nconfirms that EPA was required to produce individualized \n\n \n5 \nfinal actions based on individual petitioning refineries\u2019 \neconomic circumstances.  \nIn fact, that is just what EPA did. EPA itself has \nstated that it denied all of the small-refinery respondents\u2019 \nRFS hardship petitions because it \u201cdetermin[ed],\u201d after \n\u201cconsider[ing] each [refinery\u2019s] individual refinery infor-\nmation,\u201d that each respondent was not experiencing dis-\nproportionate economic hardship. Pet.App.14a-15a. EPA \nconcluded, after examining each respondent\u2019s evidence, \nthat each ostensibly passes on 100% of its RFS compliance \ncosts in the price of the fuel it sells. Those were the con-\nclusions on which EPA based its decisions to deny hard-\nship relief to these small-refinery respondents, each of \nwhich received an individualized explanation from EPA \nanalyzing its own economic evidence. \nMultiple courts of appeals (including the D.C. Circuit) \nhave since held that EPA\u2019s merits reasoning about the \nsmall refineries\u2019 ability to pass through their RFS compli-\nance costs was arbitrary and capricious and unsupported \nby the record evidence. But the venue issue before this \nCourt is simpler. To borrow Judge Silberman\u2019s descrip-\ntion of the venue provision that EPA endorses (U.S. Br. \n18): EPA\u2019s answer to whether a petitioning small refinery \nlike Calumet Shreveport located in Shreveport, Louisi-\nana, does or does not successfully pass through its RFS \ncompliance costs in its fuel sales hardly qualifies as a \u201creg-\nulatory issue[ ] of national importance\u201d that belongs in the \nD.C. Circuit. National Env\u2019t Dev. Ass\u2019ns Clean Air Pro-\nject v. EPA, 891 F.3d. 1041, 1054 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (Silber-\nman, J., concurring). \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment should be affirmed. \n\n \n6 \nSTATEMENT \nA. Statutory and regulatory background \n1. Venue for petitions for review under the Clean \nAir Act \nSection 7607(b)(1) governs \u201c[j]udicial review\u201d of \u201cpeti-\ntions for review\u201d of EPA\u2019s \u201cfinal action[s] under this chap-\nter,\u201d i.e., under the Clean Air Act. See Kentucky v. EPA, \n123 F.4th 447, 458, 461 (6th Cir. 2024); 42 U.S.C. Ch. 85, \nCodification Note (\u201cthis chapter\u201d is the CAA). As relevant \nhere, Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s venue instructions consist of \nthree \u201clengthy\u201d sentences. Kentucky, 123 F.4th at 458.  \na. The first sentence describes the proper venue for \nchallenging EPA final actions that apply to the nation as \na whole. That sentence begins by enumerating several \nCAA provisions authorizing EPA to take national actions. \nFor example, when EPA promulgates a national primary \nor secondary air quality standard under Section 7412, or \nsets a standard of performance for all new stationary \nsources of emissions under Section 7411, challenges to \nthose national actions \u201cmay be filed only in\u201d the D.C. Cir-\ncuit. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). In 1977, Congress amended the venue \nprovision to add a catchall phrase to that sentence: In  \naddition to the enumerated national actions, \u201cany other \nnationally applicable regulations promulgated, or final  \naction taken, by the Administrator under this chapter\u201d \nare reviewable only in the D.C. Circuit. Ibid.; see Clean \nAir Act Amendments of 1977, Pub. L. No. 95-95, 91 Stat. \n685 (Aug. 7, 1977).2 \n \n \n2  For ease of reference, the 1970 and 1982 versions of the \nvenue provision (the latter including the 1977 amendments) are \nprovided at App., infra, 29a and 30a, respectively. \n\n \n7 \nb. The second sentence follows the same basic struc-\nture but for non-national final agency actions. It first enu-\nmerates CAA provisions authorizing EPA to take actions \nthat apply to less than the whole country, and it makes \nthose actions reviewable only in regional circuit courts. \nFor example, when EPA approves or promulgates a state \nimplementation plan under Sections 7410 or 7411(d), a \nchallenge to that action \u201cmay be filed only in the United \nStates Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit.\u201d \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1). The second sentence of Section 7607(b)(1), \nlike the first, also includes a catchall phrase added by the \nsame 1977 amendment: \u201cany other final action of the  \nAdministrator under this chapter \u2026 which is locally or  \nregionally applicable\u201d is reviewable only in \u201cthe appropri-\nate circuit\u201d court. Ibid.  \nIdentifying which circuit court is \u201cappropriate\u201d for  \nreviewing local or regional final action is usually easy. \nThat\u2019s because for these EPA actions, the relevant sub-\nstantive CAA provision makes it clear that the action  \naffects particular regulated facilities or States, each of \nwhich is governed by a regional circuit court. When EPA \npromulgates a regional action that happens to touch more \nthan one federal circuit\u2014for example, approving or re-\njecting an implementation plan for the Metropolitan Kan-\nsas City air-quality-control region\u2014there may be more \nthan one appropriate circuit. \nc. The courts of appeals and EPA agree that, to  \nassess the national vs. local applicability of an EPA action \nfor purposes of Section 7607(b)(1), courts look only \u201cto the \nface\u201d of the action as that action is authorized by the \nCAA\u2014not to the challenger\u2019s arguments in the petition \nfor review, and not to the effects of the action or the rea-\nsoning within it. American Rd. & Transp. Builders Ass\u2019n \nv. EPA, 705 F.3d 453, 456 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (Kavanaugh, \n\n \n8 \nJ.); see also, e.g., ATK Launch Sys., Inc. v. EPA, 651 F.3d \n1194, 1197 (10th Cir. 2011); U.S. Br. 20 (invoking \u201cthe face \nof \u201d the actions). That focus on what action EPA took fol-\nlows from the statutory instruction to look to the \u201cfinal ac-\ntion \u2026 under this chapter\u201d to resolve venue. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). \nThe textual structure of Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s first two \nsentences\u2014enumerated lists of CAA actions followed by \ncatchall phrases\u2014indicates that courts should apply the \ncatchall phrases by reasoning by analogy to the enumer-\nated provisions. The catchall phrases use a \u201ccollective \nterm\u201d\u2014any other final action\u2014\u201cat the end of a list of spe-\ncific items,\u201d so the collective term is \u201ccontrolled and  \ndefined by reference to the specific classes that precede \nit.\u201d Fischer v. United States, 603 U.S. 480, 487 (2024) \n(ejusdem generis canon) (cleaned up); see Kentucky, 123 \nF.4th at 460 (using ejusdem generis to interpret Section \n7607(b)(1)). Thus, an EPA final action pursuant to an  \nunenumerated CAA provision is \u201cnationally applicable\u201d if \nit applies to the whole nation like the enumerated actions \nin the first sentence of Section 7607(b)(1) do. And a final  \naction is \u201clocally or regionally applicable\u201d if it applies to \nless than the whole nation, as the enumerated CAA  \nactions in the second sentence do. Ibid. \nd. The third sentence contemplates a narrow excep-\ntion for certain rare EPA actions that, though locally or \nregionally applicable, are \u201cbased on a determination of  \nnationwide scope or effect.\u201d \u00a7 7607(b)(1). That sentence \nwas added by the same 1977 amendment referenced \nabove, prompted by a recommendation from the Adminis-\ntrative Conference of the United States that included a \nstatement from EPA General Counsel William Frick. See \n41 Fed. Reg. 56,767 (Dec. 30, 1976).  \nFrick had identified a circumstance where the third-\nsentence exception was needed. 41 Fed. Reg. at 56,768-\n\n \n9 \n56,769. Under a particular CAA provision at the time \n(since repealed), EPA could grant extensions of a State\u2019s \nattainment date for certain national ambient air quality \nstandards\u2014actions that were locally applicable\u2014only \u201cif \nafter review ... the Administrator determine[d] that,\u201d \namong other things, regulated emission sources were  \n\u201cunable to comply with the [applicable] requirements \u2026 \nbecause the necessary technology or other alternatives \nare not available or will not be available soon enough to \npermit compliance.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857c-5(e) (1973) (empha-\nsis added); see NRDC v. EPA, 475 F.2d 968 (D.C. Cir. \n1973) (explaining the available-technology determination \nand corresponding extension action). \nFrick\u2019s statement, which the government agrees (U.S. \nBr. 37) was the genesis of the third sentence in Sec-\ntion 7607(b)(1), illustrates how that exception works: If \nthe statutory text requires a particular EPA action to \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

The six small refinery re-\nspondents here separately petitioned EPA for hardship \nexemptions for particular compliance years. EPA con-\ncluded, after \u201cconsider[ing] each [respondent\u2019s] individual \nrefinery information,\u201d that each of the respondents was \nnot entitled to hardship relief and denied the petitions. \nPet.App.14a-15a.

The question presented is:  \nWhether an EPA decision denying a small refinery\u2019s \nRFS hardship petition is a \u201clocally or regionally applica-\nble\u201d action, such that a court challenge to that action is \nproperly venued in a regional circuit court, or is instead a \n\u201cnationally applicable\u201d action or an action \u201cbased on a  \ndetermination of nationwide scope or effect\u201d that must be \nchallenged only in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. \nCircuit. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). \n \n \n\n \nii \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nStatutory Provision Involved ............................................. 1 \nIntroduction ......................................................................... 3 \nStatement ............................................................................. 6 \nA.

A petition for review of the Administrator\u2019s  \naction in approving or promulgating any implementation \nplan under section 7410 of this title or section 7411(d) of \nthis title, any order under section 7411(j) of this title,  \nunder section 7412 of this title, under section 7419 of this \ntitle, or under section 7420 of this title, or his action under \nsection 1857c-10(c)(2)(A), (B), or (C) of this title (as in  \neffect before August 7, 1977) or under regulations there-\nunder, or revising regulations for enhanced monitoring \nand compliance certification programs under section \n7414(a)(3) of this title, or any other final action of the  \nAdministrator under this chapter (including any denial or \ndisapproval by the Administrator under subchapter I) \nwhich is locally or regionally applicable may be filed only \nin the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate \ncircuit. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence a petition \nfor review of any action referred to in such sentence may \nbe filed only in the United States Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia if such action is based on a determi-\nnation of nationwide scope or effect and if in taking such \naction the Administrator finds and publishes that such  \naction is based on such a determination. \n* \nThis and other pertinent statutory provisions are  \nreprinted in the appendix to this brief. App.1a-31a, infra. \n \n \n\n \n3 \nINTRODUCTION \nThe Clean Air Act (\u201cCAA\u201d or \u201cAct\u201d) assigns the venue \nfor a petition for judicial review of final agency action by \nasking whether the challenged action is \u201cnationally appli-\ncable\u201d (reviewed by the D.C. Circuit) or \u201clocally or region-\nally applicable\u201d (reviewed by the regional circuit courts). \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1).1 Determining venue thus requires \nfocusing with precision on the \u201caction\u201d that the Environ-\nmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) was authorized by the \nCAA to take: the \u201cfinal action taken \u2026 under this chap-\nter.\u201d Ibid. (\u201c[T]his chapter\u201d is the CAA.) \nOnce the final action is properly identified, the venue \nprovision is straightforward. Most EPA actions under the \nAct are rulemakings or similar actions that apply through-\nout the entire nation, or else are adjudications or similar \ndecisions involving individual States or regulated entities. \nThe former go to the D.C. Circuit, the latter to the re-\ngional circuit courts\u2014save only in the exceptional circum-\nstance where the CAA\u2019s text directs EPA to base a local \naction on a \u201cdetermination\u201d about the whole nation. \nApplying those statutory instructions here shows why \nthe Fifth Circuit below got the venue question right. This \ncase concerns a type of statutory forbearance from the \nCAA\u2019s Renewable Fuel Standard (\u201cRFS\u201d) that affects \nonly small refineries. Small refineries like respondents \nmay petition EPA for an exemption from the RFS obliga-\ntion by showing that they will face disproportionate eco-\nnomic hardship from compliance with the RFS in a given \nyear. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(A)-(B). Until a presidential administra-\ntion change in 2021, EPA had repeatedly acknowledged \nthat its decisions on small refineries\u2019 hardship petitions \n \n1  All statutory citations are to Title 42 of the United States \nCode. \n\n \n4 \nare quintessential locally applicable actions that Section \n7607(b)(1) refers to the regional circuits. That\u2019s because \neach EPA \u201cfinal action\u201d on a hardship-exemption petition \nadjudicates the rights of only one small refinery located in \none place, and the \u201cchapter\u201d (the CAA) requires those ac-\ntions to be based on consideration of each small refinery\u2019s \nown economic hardship. \u00a7 7607(b)(1); see \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B). \nEPA changed its position on venue and started delib-\nerately attempting to re-direct judicial challenges to its \npreferred court, the D.C. Circuit, only after it suffered a \nstring of defeats in regional circuit courts that found EPA \nhad wrongly decided hardship petitions. EPA now argues \nthat, because it published its decisions on multiple small \nrefineries\u2019 pending hardship petitions bundled together in \ntwo explanation documents (denying every pending peti-\ntion), it was able to convert what it has long agreed were \nlocally applicable final actions into just two nationally  \napplicable actions. EPA was transparent about its goal of \nmaking the D.C. Circuit the only court allowed to review \nits latest denial decisions. \nEPA\u2019s new venue position is contrary to the CAA\u2019s \ntext, and the Fifth Circuit correctly rejected it. EPA was \nable to produce the bundled decisions only by ignoring the \nstatutory command to decide hardship petitions individu-\nally as they come in. More fundamentally, the two expla-\nnation documents were bundles of individual final actions \nunder the CAA. EPA\u2019s choice about how to publish its  \ndecisions cannot change the nature of the \u201cfinal action \ntaken \u2026 under this chapter,\u201d which is what matters for \nvenue. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). It is the statutory text\u2014\u201cth[e] chap-\nter\u201d\u2014that establishes what actions EPA is permitted to \ntake. And here, every relevant provision of the chapter \nconfirms that EPA was required to produce individualized \n\n \n5 \nfinal actions based on individual petitioning refineries\u2019 \neconomic circumstances.  \nIn fact, that is just what EPA did. EPA itself has \nstated that it denied all of the small-refinery respondents\u2019 \nRFS hardship petitions because it \u201cdetermin[ed],\u201d after \n\u201cconsider[ing] each [refinery\u2019s] individual refinery infor-\nmation,\u201d that each respondent was not experiencing dis-\nproportionate economic hardship. Pet.App.14a-15a. EPA \nconcluded, after examining each respondent\u2019s evidence, \nthat each ostensibly passes on 100% of its RFS compliance \ncosts in the price of the fuel it sells. Those were the con-\nclusions on which EPA based its decisions to deny hard-\nship relief to these small-refinery respondents, each of \nwhich received an individualized explanation from EPA \nanalyzing its own economic evidence. \nMultiple courts of appeals (including the D.C. Circuit) \nhave since held that EPA\u2019s merits reasoning about the \nsmall refineries\u2019 ability to pass through their RFS compli-\nance costs was arbitrary and capricious and unsupported \nby the record evidence. But the venue issue before this \nCourt is simpler. To borrow Judge Silberman\u2019s descrip-\ntion of the venue provision that EPA endorses (U.S. Br. \n18): EPA\u2019s answer to whether a petitioning small refinery \nlike Calumet Shreveport located in Shreveport, Louisi-\nana, does or does not successfully pass through its RFS \ncompliance costs in its fuel sales hardly qualifies as a \u201creg-\nulatory issue[ ] of national importance\u201d that belongs in the \nD.C. Circuit. National Env\u2019t Dev. Ass\u2019ns Clean Air Pro-\nject v. EPA, 891 F.3d. 1041, 1054 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (Silber-\nman, J., concurring). \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment should be affirmed. \n\n \n6 \nSTATEMENT \nA. Statutory and regulatory background \n1. Venue for petitions for review under the Clean \nAir Act \nSection 7607(b)(1) governs \u201c[j]udicial review\u201d of \u201cpeti-\ntions for review\u201d of EPA\u2019s \u201cfinal action[s] under this chap-\nter,\u201d i.e., under the Clean Air Act. See Kentucky v. EPA, \n123 F.4th 447, 458, 461 (6th Cir. 2024); 42 U.S.C. Ch. 85, \nCodification Note (\u201cthis chapter\u201d is the CAA). As relevant \nhere, Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s venue instructions consist of \nthree \u201clengthy\u201d sentences. Kentucky, 123 F.4th at 458.  \na. The first sentence describes the proper venue for \nchallenging EPA final actions that apply to the nation as \na whole. That sentence begins by enumerating several \nCAA provisions authorizing EPA to take national actions. \nFor example, when EPA promulgates a national primary \nor secondary air quality standard under Section 7412, or \nsets a standard of performance for all new stationary \nsources of emissions under Section 7411, challenges to \nthose national actions \u201cmay be filed only in\u201d the D.C. Cir-\ncuit. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). In 1977, Congress amended the venue \nprovision to add a catchall phrase to that sentence: In  \naddition to the enumerated national actions, \u201cany other \nnationally applicable regulations promulgated, or final  \naction taken, by the Administrator under this chapter\u201d \nare reviewable only in the D.C. Circuit. Ibid.; see Clean \nAir Act Amendments of 1977, Pub. L. No. 95-95, 91 Stat. \n685 (Aug. 7, 1977).2 \n \n \n2  For ease of reference, the 1970 and 1982 versions of the \nvenue provision (the latter including the 1977 amendments) are \nprovided at App., infra, 29a and 30a, respectively. \n\n \n7 \nb. The second sentence follows the same basic struc-\nture but for non-national final agency actions. It first enu-\nmerates CAA provisions authorizing EPA to take actions \nthat apply to less than the whole country, and it makes \nthose actions reviewable only in regional circuit courts. \nFor example, when EPA approves or promulgates a state \nimplementation plan under Sections 7410 or 7411(d), a \nchallenge to that action \u201cmay be filed only in the United \nStates Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit.\u201d \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1). The second sentence of Section 7607(b)(1), \nlike the first, also includes a catchall phrase added by the \nsame 1977 amendment: \u201cany other final action of the  \nAdministrator under this chapter \u2026 which is locally or  \nregionally applicable\u201d is reviewable only in \u201cthe appropri-\nate circuit\u201d court. Ibid.  \nIdentifying which circuit court is \u201cappropriate\u201d for  \nreviewing local or regional final action is usually easy. \nThat\u2019s because for these EPA actions, the relevant sub-\nstantive CAA provision makes it clear that the action  \naffects particular regulated facilities or States, each of \nwhich is governed by a regional circuit court. When EPA \npromulgates a regional action that happens to touch more \nthan one federal circuit\u2014for example, approving or re-\njecting an implementation plan for the Metropolitan Kan-\nsas City air-quality-control region\u2014there may be more \nthan one appropriate circuit. \nc. The courts of appeals and EPA agree that, to  \nassess the national vs. local applicability of an EPA action \nfor purposes of Section 7607(b)(1), courts look only \u201cto the \nface\u201d of the action as that action is authorized by the \nCAA\u2014not to the challenger\u2019s arguments in the petition \nfor review, and not to the effects of the action or the rea-\nsoning within it.

That focus on what action EPA took fol-\nlows from the statutory instruction to look to the \u201cfinal ac-\ntion \u2026 under this chapter\u201d to resolve venue. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). \nThe textual structure of Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s first two \nsentences\u2014enumerated lists of CAA actions followed by \ncatchall phrases\u2014indicates that courts should apply the \ncatchall phrases by reasoning by analogy to the enumer-\nated provisions. The catchall phrases use a \u201ccollective \nterm\u201d\u2014any other final action\u2014\u201cat the end of a list of spe-\ncific items,\u201d so the collective term is \u201ccontrolled and  \ndefined by reference to the specific classes that precede \nit.\u201d Fischer v. United States, 603 U.S. 480, 487 (2024) \n(ejusdem generis canon) (cleaned up); see Kentucky, 123 \nF.4th at 460 (using ejusdem generis to interpret Section \n7607(b)(1)). Thus, an EPA final action pursuant to an  \nunenumerated CAA provision is \u201cnationally applicable\u201d if \nit applies to the whole nation like the enumerated actions \nin the first sentence of Section 7607(b)(1) do. And a final  \naction is \u201clocally or regionally applicable\u201d if it applies to \nless than the whole nation, as the enumerated CAA  \nactions in the second sentence do. Ibid. \nd. The third sentence contemplates a narrow excep-\ntion for certain rare EPA actions that, though locally or \nregionally applicable, are \u201cbased on a determination of  \nnationwide scope or effect.\u201d \u00a7 7607(b)(1). That sentence \nwas added by the same 1977 amendment referenced \nabove, prompted by a recommendation from the Adminis-\ntrative Conference of the United States that included a \nstatement from EPA General Counsel William Frick. See \n41 Fed. Reg. 56,767 (Dec. 30, 1976).  \nFrick had identified a circumstance where the third-\nsentence exception was needed. 41 Fed. Reg. at 56,768-\n\n \n9 \n56,769. Under a particular CAA provision at the time \n(since repealed), EPA could grant extensions of a State\u2019s \nattainment date for certain national ambient air quality \nstandards\u2014actions that were locally applicable\u2014only \u201cif \nafter review ... the Administrator determine[d] that,\u201d \namong other things, regulated emission sources were  \n\u201cunable to comply with the [applicable] requirements \u2026 \nbecause the necessary technology or other alternatives \nare not available or will not be available soon enough to \npermit compliance.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857c-5(e) (1973) (empha-\nsis added); see NRDC v. EPA, 475 F.2d 968 (D.C. Cir. \n1973) (explaining the available-technology determination \nand corresponding extension action). \nFrick\u2019s statement, which the government agrees (U.S. \nBr. 37) was the genesis of the third sentence in Sec-\ntion 7607(b)(1), illustrates how that exception works: If \nthe statutory text requires a particular EPA action to be \nbased on a statutory \u201cdetermination\u201d about a circum-\nstance equally affecting the whole nation, then a chal-\nlenge to that action should go to the D.C. Circuit. \nCongress provided that \u201cif \u201d a locally applicable action \u201cis \nbased on a determination of nationwide scope or effect and \nif in taking such action [EPA] finds and publishes that \nsuch action is based on such a determination,\u201d then the \nproper venue is the D.C. Circuit. \u00a7 7607(b)(1).  \nThe third sentence thus establishes two independent \nrequirements for this exception: the action must actually \nbe based on a determination of nationwide scope or effect, \nand EPA must publish a finding that it is so based. Accord \nU.S. Br. 30. Whether EPA publishes that finding is the \nonly part of Section 7607(b)(1) that contemplates any dis-\ncretion for the agency. The text is thus \u201cclear\u201d that \u201c[t]he \ncourt\u2014not EPA\u2014determines both the scope of an  \naction\u2019s applicability and whether it was based on a deter-\n\n \n10 \nmination of nationwide scope or effect.\u201d Texas v. EPA \n(\u201cTexas 2020\u201d), 983 F.3d 826, 833 (5th Cir. 2020); accord  \nSierra Club v. EPA, 47 F.4th 738, 746 (D.C. Cir. 2022). \ne. In sum, the CAA allocates venue for regulatory \nchallenges depending on the nature of the \u201cfinal action\u201d \nunder review: If EPA\u2019s \u201cfinal action \u2026 under this chap-\nter\u201d is \u201cnationally applicable,\u201d then the proper venue is \nthe D.C. Circuit. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). If EPA\u2019s \u201cfinal action \u2026  \nunder this chapter\u201d is \u201clocally or regionally applicable,\u201d \nthen the proper venue is presumptively a regional circuit \ncourt. Ibid.; see Texas v. EPA (\u201cTexas 2016\u201d), 829 F.3d \n405, 419, 424 (5th Cir. 2016). If EPA can demonstrate both \nthat a locally applicable action is \u201cbased on a determina-\ntion of nationwide scope or effect\u201d\u2014that is, a textually \ncalled for determination reaching all the nation\u2019s regu-\nlated parties equally\u2014\u201cand\u201d that EPA \u201cf [ound] and pub-\nlishe[d] that such action is based on such a determination,\u201d \nthen venue is proper in the D.C. Circuit. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). \nThe first question for venue, then, is: What is the \u201cfinal \naction \u2026 under this chapter\u201d that EPA was authorized to \ntake? To answer that question, courts \u201clook primarily to \nthe text of the statute,\u201d specifically to the relevant CAA \nprovision that is \u201cthe legal source of [EPA\u2019s] authority to \ntake the challenged action[ ].\u201d Texas v. EPA (\u201cTexas \n2023\u201d), No. 23-60069, 2023 WL 7204840, at *4 (5th Cir. \nMay 1, 2023); see Kentucky, 123 F.4th at 460-462; West \nVirginia v. EPA, 90 F.4th 323, 329 (4th Cir. 2024). \n2. Small-refinery hardship petitions under the \nAct\u2019s RFS Program \na. The CAA\u2019s RFS program requires that increasing \namounts of renewable fuels be blended into the transpor-\ntation fuel (gasoline and diesel) sold in the United States. \n\u00a7 7545(o)(2)(A)(i), (B)(i)(I)-(IV); see HollyFrontier Chey-\nenne Refin., LLC v. Renewable Fuels Ass\u2019n, 594 U.S. 382, \n\n \n11 \n385-387 (2021). EPA first sets annual renewable fuel per-\ncentage standards across the industry. \u00a7 7545(o)(3). Obli-\ngated parties\u2014refiners and importers of transportation \nfuel\u2014use those standards to learn their own annual vol-\nume obligations for each renewable-fuel category. See 40 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 80.1406. \nObligated parties comply with their annual RFS obli-\ngations by \u201cretiring\u201d credits called renewable identifica-\ntion numbers (\u201cRINs\u201d). 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 80.1427. A RIN is \ngenerated when renewable fuel (ethanol, for example) is \nmanufactured. Id. \u00a7 80.1426. The RIN remains attached \nto the volume of renewable fuel until it is blended into \ntransportation fuel, at which point the RIN is \u201csepa-\nrated.\u201d Id. \u00a7\u00a7 80.1428, 80.1429. RINs have a limited life; \nthey can be used for compliance only in the year they are \ngenerated or the next compliance year. \u00a7 7545(o)(5)(C). \nObligated parties demonstrate RFS compliance by secur-\ning sufficient separated RINs, either by generating RINs \nthrough blending renewable fuels or by purchasing RINs \nfrom others that blend. \u00a7 7545(o)(5)(B). \nb. \u201cThe RFS program reflects a carefully crafted leg-\nislative bargain to promote renewable fuels, but also to \nprovide an exemption mechanism for small refineries.\u201d \nSinclair Wyoming Refin. Co. LLC v. EPA, 114 F.4th 693, \n711 (D.C. Cir. 2024). A \u201csmall refinery\u201d has an average \naggregate daily crude oil throughput for a calendar year \nof 75,000 barrels or less. \u00a7 7545(o)(1)(K). Congress recog-\nnized that \u201cescalating [RFS] obligations could work spe-\ncial burdens on small refineries,\u201d many of which \u201clack the \ninherent scale advantages of large refineries\u201d and are lim-\nited in their ability to blend renewable fuels\u2014or are una-\nble to blend at all. HollyFrontier, 594 U.S. at 386 (cleaned \nup). Congress also understood that small refineries are \n\n \n12 \nessential to the nation\u2019s energy supply and often \u201ca major \nsource of jobs in rural communities.\u201d Id. at 386-387. \nEPA has acknowledged that \u201c[m]any\u201d small refineries \n\u201cdo not have access to renewable fuels or the ability to \nblend them, and so must use credits to comply\u201d with the \nRFS. 72 Fed. Reg. 23,900, 23,904 (May 1, 2007). Small  \nrefineries that cannot separate enough RINs through \nblending are forced to buy RINs on an unregulated sec-\nondary market where prices can fluctuate wildly. See 75 \nFed. Reg. 14,670, 14,722 (Mar. 26, 2010) (explaining RIN \nspot markets); HollyFrontier, 594 U.S. at 398 (noting one \nyear where RIN prices \u201cshot up by as much as 100%\u201d). \nCongress initially exempted all small refineries from \nthe RFS until 2011, and it directed the U.S. Department \nof Energy (\u201cDOE\u201d) to study whether RFS compliance \nwould impose disproportionate economic hardship on \nsmall refineries. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(A). DOE completed that \nstudy in 2011, finding that small refineries \u201chave particu-\nlar obstacles that would make compliance more costly \nthan those of large integrated companies.\u201d DOE, Small \nRefinery Exemption Study: An Investigation into Dispro-\nportionate Economic Hardship 3, 32, 37 (March 2011) \n(\u201c2011 DOE Study\u201d).3 DOE also recognized that small  \nrefineries\u2019 hardship would grow increasingly acute as  \nrenewable-fuel blending mandates increased. Id. at 17-18.  \nTo avoid damaging small refineries, Congress created \na permanent safety valve that allows a small refinery to \npetition EPA for an exemption from its annual RFS obli-\ngation \u201cfor the reason of disproportionate economic hard-\nship.\u201d \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(i). The Act provides that \u201c[a] small \nrefinery may at any time petition the Administrator\u201d for \n \n3  https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-12/docu-\nments/small-refinery-exempt-study.pdf. \n\n \n13 \nan exemption\u2014and thus requires each small refinery to \npetition separately for hardship relief. Ibid. (emphasis \nadded). Each granted petition frees only one small refin-\nery from its RFS obligation for the year(s) involved in the \npetition, based on that refinery\u2019s economic circumstances. \n\u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(i)-(ii); 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 80.1441(e)(2). EPA must \ndecide each small-refinery hardship petition in \u201cconsulta-\ntion\u201d with DOE after \u201cconsider[ing] the findings\u201d of DOE\u2019s \n2011 small-refinery study along with \u201cother economic fac-\ntors.\u201d \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(A)-(B). \nCongress required EPA to decide any hardship  \npetition submitted by a small refinery \u201cnot later than 90 \ndays after\u201d receipt, because a small refinery cannot plan \nadequately for RFS compliance until it knows whether it \nhas an obligation. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(iii). But EPA has failed \nto meet that deadline for almost 90 percent of hardship \npetitions submitted since 2013, causing significant uncer-\ntainty for small refineries. See U.S. Government Account-\nability Office, Renewable Fuel Standard: Actions Needed \nto Improve Decision-Making in the Small Refinery Ex-\nemption Program 20, GAO23104273 (Nov. 2022).4 \nc. When EPA has denied small-refinery hardship  \npetitions, the petitioners sometimes sought judicial review. \nRegarding venue for those challenges, EPA repeatedly \nacknowledged that RFS hardship-exemption decisions \nare \u201cquintessentially local action[s]\u201d that must be reviewed \nin the regional circuit courts. E.g., EPA Motion to Dismiss \n18, Advanced Biofuels Ass\u2019n v. EPA, No. 18-1115, Dkt. \n1740614 (D.C. Cir. July 13, 2018). \nOn the merits of those challenges, EPA suffered a \nstreak of losses where circuit courts vacated its hardship \ndecisions. See Sinclair Wyoming Refin. Co. v. EPA, 887 \n \n4  https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-23-104273. \n\n \n14 \nF.3d 986 (10th Cir. 2017); Ergon-West Virginia, Inc. v. \nEPA, 896 F.3d 600 (4th Cir. 2018); Renewable Fuels Ass\u2019n \nv. EPA, 948 F.3d 1206 (10th Cir. 2020); Ergon-West Vir-\nginia, Inc. v. EPA, 980 F.3d 403 (4th Cir. 2020). Frus-\ntrated by its repeated defeats in the regional circuits, and \nafter a 2021 change in presidential administration, EPA \nbegan attempting to eliminate small-refinery hardship  \nrelief altogether. EPA first abandoned defense of its own \nprior decisions granting hardship relief and began newly \ninsisting that a small refinery cannot receive relief unless \nit had received an exemption in every prior compliance \nyear. This Court rejected that new position in HollyFron-\ntier. 594 U.S. at 396-397. \nWhen that effort failed, EPA went back to the drawing \nboard intent on rejecting hardship relief and avoiding  \njudicial review anywhere other than the D.C. Circuit. \nB. The present controversy \n1. The small-refinery respondents here have repeat-\nedly received RFS hardship relief from EPA in the past, \nbecause each of them faces structural disadvantages that \nmake RFS compliance disproportionately burdensome. \nThe respondents petitioned EPA again for hardship relief \nfor some or all of the compliance years 2017 through 2021. \nPet.App.19a nn.26-27. EPA initially granted Wynne-\nwood\u2019s hardship petition for 2017, and it granted Calumet \nShreveport\u2019s, Ergon Refining\u2019s, Placid\u2019s, and Wynne-\nwood\u2019s petitions for 2018. See EPA, Decision on 2018 \nSmall Refinery Exemption Petitions (Aug. 9, 2019).5 \nIn December 2021, however, EPA reversed itself and \nissued a proposal to deny every pending small-refinery \nhardship petition, including by retroactively denying pre-\n \n5 https://www.regulations.gov/comment/EPA-HQ-OAR-2021-\n0566-0077#collapseAttachmentMetadata-ember186 (Tab I). \n\n \n15 \nviously granted petitions. 86 Fed. Reg. 70,999 (Dec. 14, \n2021). EPA proposed to do so by applying multiple sea-\nchanges to the agency\u2019s longstanding approach to hard-\nship petitions. See Proposed Denials.6 EPA also proposed, \nhowever, to continue its existing practice of deciding hard-\nship petitions through agency adjudication, because ap-\nplying a new rulemaking process to hardship petitions \nfrom prior years would have been unlawfully retroactive. \nSee Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hosp., 488 U.S. 204, 208-\n209 (1988). \nEPA\u2019s proposed denials included a new statutory in-\nterpretation and a new \u201ceconomic theory\u201d hypothesizing \nthat \u201cthe RFS program cannot cause [disproportionate \neconomic hardship]\u201d because RIN costs are supposedly \nthe same for all obligated parties regardless of their size, \nbargaining power, location, or blending capability, and  \nbecause obligated parties supposedly universally pass \nthrough 100% of their RIN costs in the price of the fuel \nthey sell. Proposed Denials 11-12 & n.37. Small refineries \ncommented on the proposal, explaining why EPA\u2019s new \nstatutory position was textually unsupportable and why \ntheir individual economic evidence refuted EPA\u2019s hypoth-\nesis that small refineries universally pass on RIN costs. \nE.g., JA 131-275. \nIn April 2022, in the first set of administrative actions \nchallenged here, EPA followed through on its proposal \nand simultaneously denied 36 previously decided hard-\nship petitions (31 of which EPA had previously granted), \nincluding petitions submitted by these respondents. \nPet.App.189a-330a (the \u201cApril Denials\u201d). EPA announced \nit was satisfied that each of the petitioning small refineries \n \n6  EPA, Proposed RFS Small Refinery Exemption Decision \n(Dec. \n2021), \nhttps://www.epa.gov/renewable-fuel-standard-\nprogram/proposal-deny-petitions-small-refinery-exemptions. \n\n \n16 \nwas able to fully pass through its RIN costs in the price of \nits fuel. Id. at 209a-212a. EPA issued each small refinery \na \u201cconfidential, refinery-specific appendi[x]\u201d to the April \nDenials\u2019 explanation document, giving individualized rea-\nsons for its conclusion that each refinery could pass \nthrough 100% of its RFS costs. Id. at 199a. \nIn June 2022, EPA largely copied and pasted its April \nreasoning to announce the denial of another 69 hardship \npetitions, including these small-refinery respondents\u2019  \npetitions for some or all of the 2017 and 2019-2021 years. \nPet.App.44a-188a (the \u201cJune Denials\u201d). The June Denials\u2019 \nexplanation document stated \u201cthat none of the 69 pending \n[small-refinery hardship] petitions for the 2016-2021 com-\npliance years ha[s] demonstrated [disproportionate eco-\nnomic hardship] caused by the cost of compliance with the \nrequirements of the RFS program.\u201d Pet.App.185a. EPA \nagain provided separate \u201cconfidential, refinery-specific \nappendices\u201d explaining its findings on each small refin-\nery\u2019s RIN-cost passthrough. Pet.App.55a. \nThe refinery-specific appendices accompanying the \nApril and June Denials detailed EPA\u2019s individualized  \nassessments of each small refinery\u2019s economic condition. \nFor example, EPA considered whether one respondent \nrefinery could blend enough biodiesel given that it oper-\nates in a market that does not accept biodiesel blends, and \nwhether that refinery faced higher ethanol costs than \nother large refiners and blenders in its area. JA 285-287. \nEPA considered whether another respondent faced \nhigher transportation costs for shipping from terminals \nalong the Gulf Coast. JA 293-295. And EPA considered \nthe price impacts to another respondent from the fact \nthat, in its tri-State region, the small refinery faced dimin-\nished demand for kerosene-based jet fuel and more- \nstringent specifications for ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel. JA \n\n \n17 \n312-313. It was based on individualized, refinery-specific  \nconsiderations like those\u2014how each refinery fits in its \nown local market\u2014that EPA concluded that each of the \npetitioning small refineries \u201cis recovering its [RFS com-\npliance] costs,\u201d and for that reason is not experiencing dis-\nproportionate economic hardship. E.g., JA 280, 286, 298. \nEPA accomplished its bundled denial decisions only \nby ignoring the statutory deadline to decide the hardship \npetitions; it held dozens beyond the 90-day deadline so \nthat it could deny them together and create the appear-\nance of promulgating just two actions. \n2. The small-refinery respondents filed petitions for \njudicial review of EPA\u2019s denials of their RFS hardship  \npetitions. Because the refineries each are headquartered, \nincorporated, or operate within the Fifth Circuit, they \nsought review there. Two groups representing the inter-\nests of the biofuel industry\u2014the respondents in support \nof petitioner here (\u201cBiofuel respondents\u201d)\u2014intervened to \nsupport EPA\u2019s denials of hardship relief. \nEPA moved to dismiss the petitions or transfer them \nto the D.C. Circuit, asserting that because it had bundled \ntogether its hardship-petition denial decisions, they were \n\u201cnationally applicable\u201d or else \u201cbased on a determination \nof nationwide scope or effect.\u201d \u00a7 7607(b)(1). \nThe Fifth Circuit denied EPA\u2019s motions. Pet.App.9a-\n15a. EPA\u2019s actions denying the small refineries\u2019 hardship \npetitions were \u201clocally \u2026 applicable,\u201d not \u201cnationally  \napplicable,\u201d because they affected only the individual  \npetitioning small refineries. Id. at 11a-12a. Nor were \nEPA\u2019s actions based on any nationwide determination. Id. \nat 12a-13a. EPA conceded that it had \u201cconsidered each  \npetition on the merits and individual refinery infor-\nmation.\u201d Id. at 14a (cleaned up). And EPA\u2019s explanation \ndocuments confirm that the agency\u2019s final actions\u2014its  \n\n \n18 \nultimate denials of the hardship-exemption petitions\u2014\n\u201cre[lied] on refinery-specific determinations\u201d about each \nrefinery\u2019s own \u201ceconomic hardship\u201d factors. Id. at 15a. \nOn the merits of the small refineries\u2019 challenges, the \nFifth Circuit explained at length why EPA\u2019s hardship- \ndenial actions were \u201c(1) impermissibly retroactive; \n(2) contrary to law; and (3) counter to the record evi-\ndence.\u201d Pet.App.3a; see id. at 16a-33a. \nThe Biofuel respondents filed petitions for rehearing \nand rehearing en banc. Those were denied. Pet.App.332a-\n333a. \n3. Some other small refineries whose RFS hardship \npetitions were denied as part of EPA\u2019s April and June  \nDenials chose to petition for judicial review only in the \nD.C. Circuit. And still other small refineries filed petitions \nfor review in the regional circuits but had their petitions \ntransferred to the D.C. Circuit\u2014most without a substan-\ntive explanation or opinion. See U.S. Br. 13 & nn.2-3. \nIn July 2024, the D.C. Circuit unanimously agreed \nwith the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \u201canalysis and conclusion\u201d on the \nmerits that EPA\u2019s April and June Denials were \u201ccontrary \nto law\u201d and must be vacated. Sinclair Wyoming, 114 \nF.4th at 706-707 & n.5. The D.C. Circuit also held that the \ndenials were arbitrary and capricious because \u201creality  \nundercuts EPA\u2019s\u201d economic \u201ctheory\u201d that small refineries \ncan universally pass on their RIN costs. Id. at 713. \n \n\n \n19 \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nA. The Fifth Circuit correctly held that EPA\u2019s final \nactions challenged here were locally applicable rather \nthan nationally applicable, and were based on respond-\nents\u2019 local economic circumstances rather than any deter-\nmination of nationwide scope or effect.  \n1. Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s reference to the agency\u2019s \u201cfinal \naction \u2026 under this chapter\u201d indicates that it is the sub-\nstantive CAA text that determines what final actions the \nagency was authorized to take. Whether and how EPA \nchooses to bundle its final actions is irrelevant to venue. \nHere, every part of the relevant provision under the \n\u201cchapter\u201d\u2014especially the singular, definite articles and \nthe deadline for deciding hardship petitions indexed to \neach petition\u2019s submission date\u2014indicates that Congress \ndirected EPA to produce individualized final actions on  \nindividually submitted hardship petitions. \n2. EPA\u2019s individual denials of hardship relief were \nobviously locally appliable rather than nationally applica-\nble. The government does not argue otherwise. Those  \ndecisions on individually submitted petitions affecting \nonly one refinery look nothing like the enumerated nation-\nwide actions in Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s first sentence, but they \nclosely resemble the enumerated locally applicable ac-\ntions in the second sentence. \n3. \u201cDetermination\u201d is a term of art in the CAA. An \nEPA action is based on a determination of nationwide \nscope or effect in the rare instance where the CAA\u2019s text \ndirects EPA to make a \u201cdetermination\u201d about the entire \nnation or industry, without the need to consider individual \ncircumstances. But here, the CAA required EPA to base \nits hardship decisions on each petitioning small refinery\u2019s \nindividual economic hardship factors. And EPA\u2019s own doc-\numents confirm that the agency did just that. \n\n \n20 \nB. The government\u2019s arguments seeking D.C. Circuit \nreview fail. \n1. The government goes astray because it gets the \nrelevant \u201caction\u201d wrong. EPA contends that its denials of \n105 individually submitted hardship petitions were really \njust two actions, asserting that a court may not contest \nEPA\u2019s \u201ccharacterization\u201d of its actions. But it is the text \nof \u201cth[e] chapter,\u201d not EPA, that determines what final \nactions the agency is authorized to take.  \n2. EPA\u2019s argument for national applicability depends \non the Court accepting the agency\u2019s view of the relevant \nunit of administrative action. Even if EPA were correct \nthat the bundled decision announcements were the rele-\nvant actions, those still were not nationally applicable  \nbecause they applied only to those refineries that chose to \npetition for hardship relief, not to the whole nation. EPA \nasserts that any agency action that touches more than one \njudicial circuit is nationally applicable. But that argument \nproduces the absurd result that an expressly regional  \naction for a metropolitan region that happens to encom-\npass two States (and two circuits) would be \u201cnationally ap-\nplicable\u201d and reviewable only by the D.C. Circuit. \n3. Contrary to EPA\u2019s assertion, the hardship denial \nactions were not based on any determination of nation-\nwide scope or effect. \nThe relevant text of the \u201cchapter\u201d here, unlike other \nclosely related provisions, does not call for any \u201cdetermi-\nnation\u201d on a small-refinery hardship petition. EPA\u2019s argu-\nment depends on treating \u201cdetermination\u201d not as a term \nof art but as an amorphous concept of anything that con-\ntributed significantly to an EPA action. \nIn any event, neither EPA\u2019s new interpretation of the \nAct, nor its new RIN-cost-passthrough economic hypoth-\nesis, were \u201cnationwide determinations\u201d that formed the \n\n \n21 \n\u201cbas[is]\u201d for EPA\u2019s hardship denial decisions. Every EPA \naction necessarily rests to some degree on the agency\u2019s \nunderstanding of its statutory authority. And EPA is  \nrequired to apply a \u201cuniform\u201d statutory interpretation to \nsimilarly situated small-refinery petitioners\u2014anything \nelse would have been arbitrary. Moreover, EPA\u2019s new \nstatutory reading could not be the basis for final actions \non respondents\u2019 hardship petitions; EPA expressly did \nnot use a rulemaking here. EPA achieved final actions \nonly by applying its statutory interpretation to respond-\nents\u2019 individual economic facts. \nFor the same reason, even if EPA\u2019s economic theory \ncould qualify as a \u201cdetermination\u201d under the CAA, the  \nfinal actions denying respondents\u2019 hardship petitions \nwere not \u201cbased on\u201d it. Moving beyond hypothesis to final \nactions required EPA to test its prediction against re-\nspondents\u2019 economic evidence. And EPA acknowledges on \nthe face of the denial decisions that it did so. \nEPA\u2019s decisions here do not resemble the unusual \nCAA provision that was the genesis for the nationwide-\ndetermination exception sentence in Section 7607(b)(1).  \nEPA\u2019s appeals to policy cannot overcome the statutory \ntext. And in any event, EPA\u2019s attempt to force dozens of \nsmall refineries to litigate their RFS hardship-denial  \ndecisions together in the D.C. Circuit has served only to  \nobscure judicial consideration of the individual economic \nfactors that the CAA makes the core basis for hardship \nrelief. \n \n \n\n \n22 \nARGUMENT \nSection 7607(b)(1) sets the venue for a petition for  \nreview principally by asking whether the EPA \u201cfinal  \naction\u201d being challenged is nationally applicable or  \nlocally/regionally applicable. Courts identify the relevant \n\u201cfinal action\u201d by examining the substantive text of \u201cth[e] \nchapter\u201d\u2014the CAA. Here the chapter designates the final \nactions as EPA\u2019s denials of small refineries\u2019 individually \nsubmitted RFS hardship petitions. The statutory text \ncalls for individualized consideration of each petitioning \nsmall refinery\u2019s \u201cdisproportionate economic hardship.\u201d \n\u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B). \nOnce EPA\u2019s individual denial decisions are properly \nidentified as the \u201cfinal action[s]\u201d under challenge, their \nnational vs. local applicability is obvious: Those individual \ndenials are, as EPA has always said, \u201cquintessentially  \nlocal action[s]\u201d for Section 7607(b)(1) because they \u201cadju-\ndicate[ ] legal rights as to a single refinery in a single loca-\ntion.\u201d EPA Motion 18, Advanced Biofuels, No. 18-1115, \nsupra. The face of the actions here confirms that EPA \nreached final decisions only by examining refinery-specific \nevidence and reaching refinery-specific conclusions that \nnone of these respondents experiences disproportionate \neconomic hardship from the RFS. Indeed, the statutory \ntext compelled EPA to deny hardship relief based on the \npetitioning small refineries\u2019 own economic circum-\nstances\u2014not any nationwide determination. So the Fifth \nCircuit correctly held that it was the proper venue rather \nthan the D.C. Circuit. \nThe government contends (U.S. Br. 28-29) that these \nhardship-petition denial actions are nationally applica-\nble\u2014unlike all prior hardship decisions\u2014because EPA \nhas \u201ccharacteriz[ed]\u201d them differently. EPA conceives of \nits decisions denying 105 separately submitted hardship \n\n \n23 \npetitions as just two national actions because it chose to \nannounce those denials together. But EPA does not  \ndecide what the relevant \u201cfinal action\u201d is under the CAA\u2014\nthe statute does. The substantive CAA provision at issue \ndesignates each individual hardship decision as the rele-\nvant unit of administrative action, none of which applies in \nmore than one circuit. EPA\u2019s suggestions that any action \nhappening to touch more than one circuit is \u201cnationally  \napplicable,\u201d and that it can manufacture nationally appli-\ncable actions by bundling individual decisions together, \nare inconsistent with the CAA\u2019s text, context, and history, \nas well as common sense. \nAlternatively, EPA claims that these hardship deci-\nsions are locally applicable but based on a new statutory \ninterpretation and economic theory that have nationwide \nscope or effect. Wrong, both times. EPA\u2019s musings about \nits statutory instructions, and its generalized economic \nhypothesis about small refineries\u2019 RIN costs, were merely \nsteps along the way of EPA\u2019s individual-refinery deci-\nsionmaking process. Neither was a \u201cdetermination\u201d\u2014 \na term of art in the CAA\u2014called for by the text. And nei-\nther produced any final agency action. EPA\u2019s final actions \nwere instead expressly based on its conclusions about \neach petitioning small refinery\u2019s economic circumstances. \nEPA itself says it denied respondents\u2019 hardship petitions \nbased on its (erroneous) view that each refinery \u201cis recov-\nering its [RFS compliance] costs.\u201d E.g., JA 280, 286, 298 \n(emphasis added). \nUnder the venue instructions in Section 7607(b)(1),  \nreview of these hardship-petition actions belongs in the \nregional circuit courts\u2014exactly where prior actions on \nsimilar petitions have long been reviewed. The Fifth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s judgment should be affirmed. \n\n \n24 \nA. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision was correct. \nIdentifying the proper venue for judicial review under \nSection 7607(b)(1) involves three questions: (1) What  \n\u201cfinal action\u201d did EPA take \u201cunder\u201d the CAA? (2) Was \nthat final action locally or regionally applicable, as opposed \nto nationally applicable? (3) If so, was the action neverthe-\nless \u201cbased on a determination of nationwide scope or  \neffect\u201d? The Fifth Circuit answered each of those ques-\ntions correctly. \n1. The \u201cfinal action[s]\u201d are EPA\u2019s denials of each \nsmall-refinery\u2019s hardship petition. \na. The parties and the courts of appeals agree that \n\u201cSection 7607(b)(1) categorizes petitions for [judicial]  \nreview according to the nature of the [EPA] action\u201d being \nchallenged. Texas 2016, 829 F.3d at 419; accord U.S. Br. \n20 (citing additional cases). But a court cannot assess an  \naction\u2019s nature until it identifies \u201cwhat \u2018final action\u2019 [it is] \ndealing with.\u201d Kentucky v. EPA, Nos. 23-3216/23-3225, \n2023 WL 11871967, at *2 (6th Cir. July 25, 2023).  \nThe statute helpfully describes how to answer that \nquestion: refer to the \u201cfinal action of [EPA] under this \nchapter.\u201d \u00a7 7607(b)(1) (emphasis added). \u201c[T]his chapter\u201d \nis the CAA. See p. 6, supra. Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s phrase  \n\u201cfinal action \u2026 under this chapter\u201d points the reader to \nthe substantive CAA provision that provides \u201cthe legal \nsource of the agency\u2019s \u2026 authority to take the challenged \nactions.\u201d Texas 2023, 2023 WL 7204840, at *4; see p. 10, \nsupra (additional cases making the same point). \nSection 7607(b)(1)\u2019s overall structure makes this even \nmore clear. By enumerating specific CAA sections author-\nizing national or local/regional actions in the first two sen-\ntences, and then adding a catchall clause to each sentence \nfor \u201cany other\u201d nationally or locally/regionally applicable \naction, the venue provision repeatedly requires cross ref-\n\n \n25 \nerencing the CAA provision that authorized the EPA  \naction under challenge. See Kentucky, 123 F.4th at 461 \n(Section 7607(b)(1) \u201cfocuses on the statute \u2026 to distin-\nguish\u201d national vs. local/regional actions). \nb. The \u201cfinal action\u201d that the CAA authorized here is \nfor EPA to \u201cact on\u201d a small refinery\u2019s individually submit-\nted RFS hardship petition. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B); see Pet.App. \n185a (EPA invoking \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B) as its source of author-\nity). So that is the \u201crelevant unit of administrative action\u201d \nfor venue purposes. Texas 2023, 2023 WL 7204840, at *4.  \nEverything about that substantive text demonstrates \nthat EPA\u2019s final actions on hardship petitions are to be \nindividualized. Every reference in that subsection to the \n\u201cpetition\u201d or the petitioning \u201crefinery\u201d is in the singular: \n\u201cA small refinery may at any time petition\u201d EPA for a \nhardship exemption, based on the \u201creason of dispropor-\ntionate economic hardship\u201d if required to comply with the \nRFS. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(i) (emphasis added). EPA must \n\u201cevaluat[e] a petition,\u201d considering the findings of the \n2011 DOE small-refinery study and other economic fac-\ntors. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(ii) (emphasis added). Whether a par-\nticular petitioning small refinery is experiencing dis-\nproportionate economic hardship from the RFS in a given \nyear is necessarily an individualized inquiry focused on \nthat refinery\u2019s own economic circumstances.  \nCongress also provided that the statutory deadline for \nEPA to \u201cact on any [small-refinery hardship] petition\u201d is \nindexed to each petition: \u201cnot later than 90 days after the \ndate of receipt of the petition.\u201d \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(iii). That \nprovision forcefully confirms that Congress directed EPA \nto produce individualized actions on hardship petitions; \nthe rolling, refinery-specific deadlines would make no \nsense otherwise. Cf. Kentucky, 123 F.4th at 461 (EPA\u2019s \nobligation \u201cto \u2018act\u2019 on each State\u2019s \u2018submission\u2019 on a plan-\n\n \n26 \nby-plan basis within a specified time\u201d indicates those  \nactions are locally rather than nationally applicable) (cita-\ntion omitted). And as mentioned above (p. 17, supra), EPA \nwas able to produce bundled hardship decisions only by \ndeliberately ignoring the CAA\u2019s decision deadline. \nThe broader statutory context also shows that Con-\ngress did not intend its \u201csingular\u201d definite and indefinite \narticles in this subsection to \u201cinclude and apply to several \npersons, parties, or things.\u201d Contra U.S. Br. 26 (quoting \n1 U.S.C. \u00a7 1). Congress initially granted a blanket exemp-\ntion from the RFS through 2011 to all \u201csmall refineries\u201d\u2014\nplural. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(A)(i). Congress then directed EPA to \nextend that exemption for another two years on an indi-\nvidualized basis to only \u201ca\u201d small refinery that DOE  \ndetermined would face disproportionate economic hard-\nship from the RFS. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(A)(ii)(II). After that, Con-\ngress transitioned to the current petition-based approach. \n\u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B). The statute now puts the onus on each \nsmall refinery to request hardship relief based on its own \n\u201cdisproportionate economic hardship.\u201d \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(i). \nCongress knew how to authorize blanket or multiple  \nexemption actions, but it did not do so here. Congress  \ninstead directed EPA to \u201cact on\u201d \u201cthe petition\u201d \u201csubmit-\nted by a small refinery.\u201d \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(iii) (emphases \nadded). \nc. Federal courts\u2019 practice also reflects the reality \nthat EPA\u2019s individual hardship-exemption decisions are \nthe final actions for venue purposes. When the Fifth Cir-\ncuit below held that EPA\u2019s denial decisions were unlawful, \nit did not vacate all 105 EPA denial decisions, despite the \ngovernment\u2019s urging that it had produced just two na-\ntional actions. Instead, the Fifth Circuit properly vacated \nonly the denial decisions for the small refineries before it. \nPet.App.34a. \n\n \n27 \nIn another recent case involving subsequent small- \nrefinery hardship decisions that EPA bundled together, \nthe government moved the D.C. Circuit to act separately \non the denial decisions for particular refineries\u2014to vacate \nsome final actions in EPA\u2019s bundle but not others. See \nCalumet Montana Refin., LLC v. EPA, No. 23-1194, Dkt. \n2081226 (Oct. 21, 2024); see id., Dkt. 2091139 (Dec. 23, \n2024) (D.C. Circuit granting limited vacatur in accord with \nEPA\u2019s request). That motion confirms EPA\u2019s agreement \nthat, even when it bundles small-refinery hardship deci-\nsions together, courts review the individual final actions \nthat apply to each refinery. And EPA would surely take \nthe position that each denied refinery must file a petition \nfor review to obtain judicial review at all. \n* \nThe relevant \u201cfinal action[s]\u201d for venue purposes are \nthus EPA\u2019s decisions on each small refinery\u2019s hardship \npetition, regardless of EPA\u2019s choice to bundle its petition  \ndecisions. Accord Kentucky, 123 F.4th at 460-463 (reject-\ning EPA\u2019s argument that its consolidated disapprovals of \n21 state implementation plans constituted a single action). \nOnce the action is properly identified, it \u201cmakes this case \neasy.\u201d Id. at 461. EPA\u2019s individual denial decisions are  \nobviously locally/regionally applicable\u2014the government \ndoesn\u2019t try to argue otherwise. And those decisions did \nnot involve any nationwide \u201cdetermination\u201d called for by \nthe CAA. Rather, each was based (as they must be per the \nAct) on EPA\u2019s refinery-specific evaluations of each peti-\ntioning small refinery\u2019s own economic hardship factors\u2014\nthings like local-market acceptance of renewable fuel, \npercentage of diesel production, access to capital, etc. See, \ne.g., JA 280, 285-287, 293-298. \n\n \n28 \n2. EPA\u2019s denials of the hardship petitions are \u201clocally \nor regionally applicable\u201d actions. \na. The venue provision\u2019s \u201capplicability\u201d inquiry\u2014 \nnationally vs. locally/regionally applicable\u2014asks about \n\u201cthe location of the persons or enterprises that the action \nregulates.\u201d Texas v.

Multiple courts of  \nappeals have agreed, at the government\u2019s urging, that \nwhat matters is \u201cthe face of \u201d the action, American Road, \n705 F.3d at 456 (Kavanaugh, J.), not the action\u2019s reasoning \nor practical \u201ceffects,\u201d ATK Launch, 651 F.3d at 1197.  \nAccord U.S. Br. 20-21 (citing additional cases).7 \nThe \u201c \u2018ordinary meaning\u2019 \u201d of the \u201ckey words\u201d in Sec-\ntion 7607(b)(1)\u2019s first sentence\u2014\u201c \u2018nationally applicable \nregulations promulgated, or final action taken\u2019 by the \nEPA\u201d\u2014\u201cconvey[s] that the challenged regulations or  \naction must apply to the entire country.\u201d Kentucky, 123 \nF.4th at 459 (emphasis added; citations omitted).

The word \u201cna-\ntionally\u201d refers to an EPA action affecting the \u201cnation as \na whole.\u201d Ibid. (citation omitted). \nTwo different canons of construction confirm that  \ninterpretation. The first is ejusdem generis. See Ken-\ntucky, 123 F.4th at 460.

Ibid. (citing Bissonnette v. LePage \nBakeries Park St., LLC, 601 U.S. 246, 252 (2024)). And the \nfirst sentence\u2019s enumerated CAA actions all \u201chave nation-\nwide applicability,\u201d ibid.: They regulate across the whole \nnation without individualized consideration, and they  \napply irrespective of whether any party requested agency \naction or not. By contrast, the enumerated locally applica-\nble actions in Section 7607(b)(1) involve individual regu-\nlated entities or States. Finding a \u201cnationally applicable\u201d \naction for purposes of the catchall clause thus requires \nidentifying an EPA final action that similarly affects the \nentire nation, irrespective of a party\u2019s local circumstances. \nSecond, \u201ccourts presume that Congress means to \nadopt \u2018clear boundaries\u2019 in \u2018jurisdictional statutes\u2019 to avoid \nwasteful litigation over the proper forum.\u201d Kentucky, 123 \nF.4th at 460 (quoting Direct Mktg. Ass\u2019n v. Brohl, 575 \nU.S. 1, 11 (2015), and citing other cases). The courts of  \nappeals have agreed that Section 7607(b)(1) is a venue \nprovision rather than a jurisdictional one.8 But the basic \npoint is the same: No one\u2019s interests are served by com-\nplex disputes over venue. Clear boundaries are set by giv-\ning \u201cnationally applicable\u201d its ordinary meaning: An EPA \nfinal action is \u201cnationally applicable\u201d for purposes of  \nSection 7607(b)(1) when it governs the entire nation, as  \nopposed to when it governs some lesser subset of regu-\nlated parties, States, or regions. \nb. In the context of the RFS program, the CAA  \nauthorizes EPA to take some national actions and some \nlocal actions. For example: When EPA publishes annual \n \n8  See Texas 2016, 829 F.3d at 418; Dalton Trucking, Inc. v. \nEPA, 808 F.3d 875, 879 (D.C. Cir. 2015); Clean Water Action \nCouncil of Ne. Wis., Inc. v. EPA, 765 F.3d 749, 751 (7th Cir. \n2014). \n\n \n30 \nrenewable-fuel blending-volume obligations for the indus-\ntry, that is a nationally applicable action, and any chal-\nlenge to it goes to the D.C. Circuit. See, e.g., Americans \nfor Clean Energy v. EPA, 864 F.3d 691 (D.C. Cir. 2017). \nThat\u2019s because EPA\u2019s volumes rule affects every RFS-\nobligated party in the nation.  \nBut when EPA decides a small refinery\u2019s RFS hard-\nship petition, that is a \u201cquintessentially local action,\u201d as \nEPA itself has previously (correctly) put it. EPA Motion \n18, Advanced Biofuels, No. 18-1115, supra. Hardship  \ndecisions look nothing like the national actions enumer-\nated in Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s first sentence, but they closely \nresemble the individualized decisions enumerated in the \nsecond sentence. Hardship decisions do not regulate the \nwhole nation or industry; they \u201cinvolve only the regulation \nof \u201d individual facilities\u2019 requests for relief and \u201chave legal \nconsequences only for [those] facilities.\u201d Texas 2023, 2023 \nWL 7204840, at *5; see West Virginia Chamber of Com-\nmerce v. Browner, 166 F.3d 336 (4th Cir. 1998) (finding it \n\u201cclearly regionally applicable\u201d \u201cwhen the EPA \u2026 makes \na determination with respect to a particular facility\u201d). \nAs EPA has previously explained: Each of the small-\nrefinery respondents\u2019 hardship petitions \u201conly requested \nrelief for one refinery.\u201d EPA Reply in Support of Motion \nto Dismiss 2, Lion Oil Co. v. EPA, No. 14-3405, Dkt. \n4227218 (8th Cir. Dec. 17, 2014). And each denial action \nwas a \u201cdecision with respect to a particular small refin-\nery\u2019s request\u201d that \u201cadjudicates legal rights as to that sin-\ngle refinery in its single location.\u201d U.S. Br. 15, Producers \nof Renewables United for Integrity Truth and Transpar-\nency v. EPA (\u201cPRUITT\u201d), No. 18-1202, Dkt. 1775897 \n(D.C. Cir. Mar. 4, 2019). \nThat is why EPA has repeatedly argued that RFS \nhardship decisions are locally applicable for Section \n\n \n31 \n7607(b)(1), before EPA began attempting to manufacture \nvenue in the D.C. Circuit by bundling decisions together. \nE.g., PRUITT, No. 18-1202, supra; EPA Response 2,  \nRenewable Fuels Ass\u2019n v. EPA, No. 18-9533, Dkt. 35 (10th \nCir.

May 28, 2020) \n(challenge to denied hardship petition \u201cproperly venued\u201d \nin Fourth Circuit \u201cbecause the action is locally or region-\nally applicable\u201d). \n3. EPA\u2019s actions were based on local economic facts, \nnot any nationwide statutory determination. \na. Because EPA\u2019s denials of respondents\u2019 RFS hard-\nship petitions are \u201clocally or regionally applicable ac-\ntion[s],\u201d the text of Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s third sentence \npresumptively \u201crequires review in th[e] [regional] cir-\ncuit.\u201d Texas 2016, 829 F.3d at 424; see Kentucky, 2023 WL \n11871967, at *3. EPA can overcome that presumption only \nby demonstrating that its denials were \u201cbased on a deter-\nmination of nationwide scope or effect.\u201d \u00a7 7607(b)(1); see \npp. 8-10, supra. \nThe courts of appeals broadly agree that the scope and \neffect of EPA\u2019s determinations are reviewed \u201cde novo\u201d \nand without deference to the agency. Texas 2016, 829 F.3d \nat 421 (5th Cir.); see Sierra Club, 47 F.4th at 746 (D.C. \nCir.); Dalton Trucking, Inc. v. EPA, 808 F.3d 875, 881 \n(D.C. Cir. 2015). The third-sentence exception applies \nonly \u201cif [the] action is based on a determination of nation-\nwide scope or effect and if in taking such action the Ad-\nministrator finds and publishes that such action is based \non such a determination.\u201d \u00a7 7607(b)(1) (emphases added). \nIt does not suffice for EPA to find and publish a nation-\nwide-effect conclusion; the action must actually be based \non a determination of nationwide scope or effect and EPA \n\n \n32 \nmust publish that finding. The first of those independent \n\u201ctwo conditions\u201d (unlike the second) makes no reference \nto what EPA finds or publishes, so it is a legal question for \nthe courts. Texas 2016, 829 F.3d at 421; see Sierra Club, \n47 F.4th at 746; see also Loper Bright Enterprises v. Rai-\nmondo, 603 U.S. 369 (2024). \nBoth the text and history of Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s third \nsentence show that, to trigger the exception, the relevant \nsubstantive CAA provision must textually direct EPA to \nmake a \u201cdetermination\u201d for the entire nation\u2014i.e., the \nkind of determination that does not depend on individual \ncircumstances. See pp. 8-9, supra. That was the kind of \nstatutory determination identified by EPA General Coun-\nsel Frick that the government agrees (U.S. Br. 18) \nprompted Congress to add the third sentence to Section \n7607(b)(1). And the government further agrees (U.S. Br. \n31) that Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s \u201cbased on\u201d formulation means \nthe relevant EPA determination cannot be \u201cperipheral or \nextraneous\u201d but must \u201clie at the core of the agency  \naction.\u201d Texas 2016, 829 F.3d at 419. \nThe CAA is littered with provisions requiring \u201cdeter-\nminations\u201d as the basis for final actions. In fact, more than \nhalf of the CAA\u2019s sections call for at least one determina-\ntion before EPA can act. See generally 42 U.S.C. Ch. 85. \nCongress\u2019s repeated use of the term \u201cdetermination\u201d or \nits derivatives throughout the Act indicates it is a term of \nart with the same meaning in Section 7607(b)(1). See  \nMohamad v. Palestinian Auth., 566 U.S. 449, 456 (2012). \nSo courts do not apply Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s third sentence \nby asking generally about the inputs or processes for an \nEPA action; they look to whether the statutory text called \nfor taking that action on the basis of a specific kind of  \ndetermination. See Kentucky, 123 F.4th at 463-464 (\u201cWhen \nused to describe a ruling from an \u2018administrative agency,\u2019 \n\n \n33 \n\u2018determination\u2019 has a more precise \u2018legal meaning\u2019 \u201d that \ndoes \u201cnot\u201d refer to \u201ceach preliminary step on the road to \n[the agency\u2019s] decision.\u201d) (citation omitted). \nb. EPA\u2019s denials of the small-refinery respondents\u2019 \nhardship petitions were not based on any statutory deter-\nminations of nationwide scope or effect.  \ni. That is so, first, because the relevant CAA provi-\nsion here (\u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)) does not call for any determi-\nnation at all. Unlike the immediately preceding subsection \nand other subsections within the same section, subsection \n7545(o)(9)(B) does not use the phrase \u201cdetermination\u201d or \n\u201cdetermines.\u201d It instead invites a small refinery to peti-\ntion for relief \u201cfor the reason of disproportionate economic \nhardship,\u201d and it says that EPA should \u201cevaluat[e]\u201d that \nhardship petition in consultation with DOE after consid-\nering DOE\u2019s 2011 study and \u201cother economic factors.\u201d \nThere are no statutory \u201cdetermination[s]\u201d in that process. \nTo the extent Section 7545(o)(9)(B) contemplates any \nstatutory determination at all, it calls for a determination \nthat has a local scope and effect. After the blanket RFS \nexemption for small refineries ended in 2011, Congress  \ndirected EPA to extend an exemption for at least two \nmore years \u201c[i]n the case of a small refinery that the Sec-\nretary of Energy determines \u2026 would be subject to a dis-\nproportionate economic hardship if required to comply \nwith\u201d the RFS. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(A)(ii)(II) (emphases added). \nNo longer did all small refineries nationwide get the  \nexemption; only those specific small refineries that were  \ndetermined to face disproportionate economic hardship. \nThat provision required EPA to grant exemptions based \non DOE\u2019s local determination that a particular small  \nrefinery would face hardship. \n \n\n \n34 \nCongress then provided in the very next subsection\u2014\nthe one at issue here\u2014that \u201c[a] small refinery may at any \ntime petition [EPA] for an extension of the exemption  \nunder subparagraph (A) for the reason of disproportion-\nate economic hardship.\u201d \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(i). The reference \nback to \u201csubparagraph (A)\u201d indicates that, when EPA \nconsiders a small refinery\u2019s hardship petition, it must \nmake the same individualized hardship determinations \nthat drove the earlier regime. \nThe plain text of \u201cth[e] chapter\u201d thus compels EPA\u2019s \nhardship decisions to be \u201cbased on\u201d an economic analysis \nfor \u201ca\u201d petitioning small refinery that is local in scope and \neffect. \u00a7 7607(b)(1); \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(i). EPA has said the \nsame thing: the Act \u201cgive[s] EPA the authority to grant \n[a hardship] petition only when a small refinery demon-\nstrates it is experiencing [hardship] caused by compliance \nwith the RFS program.\u201d Pet.App.185a. That must be the \ncore basis for any final action on a hardship petition. \nii. Moreover, the record here shows that EPA in fact \nbased its final actions denying hardship relief on just such \nindividualized conclusions. EPA explained that it had \n\u201ccompleted a thorough evaluation of the data and infor-\nmation provided in the [hardship] petitions, supplemental \nsubmissions, and comments to determine if any of the  \npetitioners have demonstrated that the cost of compliance \nwith the RFS is the cause of their alleged [hardship].\u201d \nPet.App.94a-95a. EPA then found \u201cthat none of the\u201d \npending petitions had \u201cdemonstrated [hardship] caused \nby the cost of compliance with the requirements of the \nRFS program.\u201d Pet.App.185a; accord U.S. Br. 10 (\u201cEPA  \ndetermined that none of the petitioning small refineries \nhad rebutted [the RIN-cost-passthrough] presumption \nthrough evidence about their specific circumstances.\u201d). \n\n \n35 \nTo be sure, EPA had hypothesized in the proposed  \ndenials, before its final actions, that no small refinery \nwould suffer hardship from the RFS because each could \nfully pass through its RIN costs. But that was merely a \nhypothesis. EPA called it then an \u201ceconomic theory,\u201d \nPet.App.212a n.42, 251a; and calls it now (U.S. Br. 8) a \u201cre-\nbuttable presumption.\u201d Whatever it\u2019s called, for EPA to \ntest its hypothesis\u2014to move beyond theory and produce \nfinal agency action on the hardship petitions\u2014EPA con-\ncedes that it needed to, and did, \u201ccarefully review[ ] data, \n[fuel-sales] contracts, and other information from small \nrefineries.\u201d Pet.App.98a-99a. It was only then that EPA \nconcluded (erroneously) that each small refinery actually \n\u201cis recovering its [RFS compliance] costs,\u201d e.g., JA 280, \n286, 298, and for that reason does not face economic hard-\nship, Pet.App.100a. \n* \nBoth the statutory text and record confirm that EPA \ntook these final actions \u201cbased on\u201d conclusions that none \nof the small-refinery respondents would experience  \ndisproportionate economic hardship from the RFS. \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1). Even if those conclusions could qualify as \n\u201cdeterminations\u201d at all, they were local determinations \nbased on an analysis of each refinery\u2019s local evidence, not \nany \u201cdetermination of nationwide scope or effect.\u201d Ibid. \nB. EPA\u2019s arguments seeking D.C. Circuit review fail. \nDespite EPA\u2019s longtime position that its final actions \non hardship petitions are reviewable only in the regional \ncircuit courts, EPA now argues that these denial decisions \nwere nationally applicable, or else were based on a deter-\nmination of nationwide scope or effect. EPA is wrong on \nboth points. \n\n \n36 \n1. EPA gets the \u201caction\u201d wrong. \nEPA does not attempt to argue that its individual \nhardship-petition decisions\u2014as opposed to its bundled  \nexplanations in the April and June Denials of its reasons \nfor denying those petitions\u2014were nationally applicable. \nEPA\u2019s argument thus hangs on this Court being willing to \ncredit its assertion that it produced just two final actions. \nBut the statute shows EPA is wrong about that. It is the \nchapter\u2019s text, not EPA, that establishes what qualifies as \nthe relevant \u201caction\u201d \u201cunder\u201d the CAA. Texas 2023, 2023 \nWL 7204840, at *4. \na. EPA\u2019s brief offers no real attempt to analyze the \nfirst critical phrase in Section 7607(b)(1): \u201cfinal action \u2026 \nunder this chapter.\u201d The government says (U.S. Br. 28-\n29) all that matters is \u201cEPA\u2019s characterization of its own \nagency action\u201d and that courts may not \u201csecond-guess \nEPA\u2019s own framing.\u201d But all agree it is the nature of the \nadministrative action that matters for venue. See pp. 22-\n23, supra. And nothing in the statute gives EPA the power \nto alter the nature of administrative actions just by choos-\ning how to publish those actions (grouped together vs.  \nindividual announcements). EPA\u2019s argument calls back to \nan era before this Court held squarely that \u201ccourts, not \nagencies,\u201d determine \u201cthe meaning of statutory provi-\nsions.\u201d Loper Bright, 603 U.S. at 392, 394. \nThe Sixth Circuit recently explained why it rejected \nthe same argument advanced by the government here: \nthat EPA\u2019s choice of framing, rather than the statutory \ntext, controls what counts as the final action. See Ken-\ntucky, 123 F.4th at 460-463. \u201cThe \u2018structure\u2019 of the judicial-\nreview provision \u2026 focuses on the statute\u201d\u2014not on how \nEPA chose to report its decisions\u2014\u201cto distinguish the \nEPA actions that parties must challenge in the D.C. Cir-\ncuit from those they must challenge in regional circuits.\u201d \n\n \n37 \nId. at 461 (quoting Engine Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. South Coast Air \nQuality Mgmt. Dist., 541 U.S. 246, 252 (2004)). Congress\u2019s \nown designation in Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s first two sen-\ntences of enumerated actions as either nationally applica-\nble or locally applicable, combined with catchall phrases \nfor each sentence, indicates it is the Act, not EPA, that \ngives an action its nature. See ibid. \nEPA\u2019s invocation (U.S. Br. 28) of \u201cthe face of the final \naction\u201d does not advance the analysis. \u201cTh[at] argument \nconflates the [explanation] issued\u201d for EPA\u2019s hardship-\ndenial decisions \u201cwith the \u2018final action\u2019 that the EPA \ntakes.\u201d Kentucky, 123 F.4th at 462 (quoting \u00a7 7607(b)(1)). \nSmall-refinery respondents\u2019 position does not depend on \nthe contents of any petitioner\u2019s court challenge to the \nEPA action or on downstream effects. Venue depends,  \ninstead, on whether the text of the chapter shows the chal-\nlenged action on its face to be more like Section \n7607(b)(1)\u2019s enumerated nationally applicable actions \n(governing the whole nation) or more like the enumerated \nlocally applicable actions that resolve individual parties\u2019 \nrights or obligations. \nb. None of that calls into question EPA\u2019s \u201cfree[dom] \nto fashion [its] own rules of procedure,\u201d including \n\u201c \u2018whether applications should be heard contemporane-\nously or successively.\u2019 \u201d U.S. Br. 26-27 (quoting FCC v. \nPottsville Broad. Co., 309 U.S. 134, 138 (1940)). That free-\ndom includes the \u201cprocess\u201d for taking action; for example, \nthe freedom (where the law permits) to choose between \n\u201crulemaking, individual adjudication, or a combination of \nthe two.\u201d NAACP v. Federal Power Comm\u2019n, 425 U.S. \n662, 668 (1976). EPA could have conducted a rulemaking \nto establish a new interpretation of Section 7545(o)(9)(B) \nand new adjudicatory framework, and such a rule would \nlikely have been nationally applicable. But a new rule like \n\n \n38 \nthat would have needed to be prospective only, see p. 15, \nsupra, which did not meet EPA\u2019s goal here to issue long-\noverdue decisions denying previously submitted small- \nrefinery hardship petitions from prior years.  \nRespondents\u2019 position thus does not disturb EPA\u2019s \nchoice whether to proceed by rulemaking versus adjudi-\ncation. EPA will retain flexibility in running its future \nhardship decisionmaking processes, so long as it examines \neach small refinery\u2019s evidence and adheres to the statu-\ntory decision deadline for final action on each petition. \nWhat EPA may not do is what it attempted here: disre-\ngard whether the CAA\u2019s text calls for local rather than \nnational action. Contrary to EPA\u2019s assertion (U.S. Br. \n26-27), respondents\u2019 textual analysis does not rely merely \non \u201can indefinite article.\u201d As described above (pp. 24-27,  \nsupra), every relevant part of the text and structure of \nSection 7545(o)(9) confirms that Congress wanted RFS \nhardship decisions to be individualized. Cf. Kentucky, 123 \nF.4th at 461 (\u201cthe disapproval of each state plan qualifies \nas a distinct \u2018action\u2019 \u201d). \n2. EPA fails to establish that the hardship decisions \nare nationally applicable. \nWith EPA\u2019s misidentification of the relevant final  \naction corrected, the errors in its remaining arguments \nbecome clear. EPA\u2019s April and June 2022 explanation doc-\numents asserted that the agency had taken nationally  \napplicable actions for two reasons. First, EPA announced \ntogether the denial of hardship petitions submitted by  \nrefineries located in different circuits. Pet.App.185a-188a \n(June 2022 announcement: \u201cThis final action denies 69  \npetitions \u2026 for over 30 small refineries across the coun-\ntry[.]\u201d); Pet.App.327a-330a (similar for April 2022 an-\nnouncement). Second, EPA applied its new statutory \ninterpretation and new economic passthrough hypothesis \n\n \n39 \nto all hardship petitions that the agency adjudicated. E.g., \nPet.App.187a-188a (\u201cEPA\u2019s revised interpretation of the \nrelevant CAA provisions and the RIN discount and RIN \ncost passthrough principles \u2026 are applicable to all small \nrefineries.\u201d). \na. Although EPA defended the second venue argu-\nment in its certiorari petition, U.S. Pet. 10 (arguing that \nthe Denials \u201care \u2018nationally applicable\u2019 because they apply \na uniform methodology to small refineries\u201d), it has now \nabandoned it, making only the geographic argument here. \nU.S. Br. 19-24. Rightly so. Looking to the legal standard \nor reasoning applied would contradict EPA\u2019s long-held \nposition\u2014accepted by multiple courts of appeals\u2014that \nonly \u201cthe face\u201d of the challenged action matters for venue, \nnot the action\u2019s reasoning or effects. See p. 28, supra.9 \nb. EPA\u2019s argument that the actions here were nation-\nally applicable because of geography rests on two errone-\nous premises. First, as discussed just above in Part B.1, it \nwrongly assumes the relevant \u201cactions\u201d are the two docu-\nments explaining EPA\u2019s reasons for denying 105 individ-\nually submitted hardship petitions. \u201c[T]hrow[ing] a \nblanket labeled \u2018national\u2019 over [105] individual decisions\u201d \ndoes not \u201cconvert\u201d them \u201cinto \u2026 national one[s].\u201d West \nVirginia, 90 F.4th at 330. That is especially so when EPA \n \n9  Biofuel respondents\u2019 argument (at Br. 36) that \u201csmall- \nrefinery exemption decisions\u201d are \u201cinherently nationally appli-\ncable\u201d because they affect \u201cthe amount of renewable fuel that \nobligated parties must inject into the nation\u2019s transportation-\nfuel supply\u201d fails for the same reason. The \u201capplicability\u201d in-\nquiry is unconcerned with the \u201cpractical effects\u201d of the EPA \naction. American Road, 705 F.3d at 456 (Kavanaugh, J.). Espe-\ncially a downstream issue like whether EPA chooses to adjust \nvolume obligations for other parties based on outcomes of small \nrefineries\u2019 hardship petitions. \n\n \n40 \nwas able to get all of these individual decisions under its \npurportedly \u201cnational\u201d blanket only by refusing to follow \nthe CAA\u2019s 90-day deadline for answering the hardship  \npetitions. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(iii). Courts generally \u201cwill not \nsuffer a party to profit by his own wrongdoing.\u201d United \nStates v. Houlihan, 92 F.3d 1271, 1279 (1st Cir. 1996). And \nthe government \u201cshould turn square corners in dealing \nwith the people.\u201d Department of Homeland Sec. v.  \nRegents of the Univ. of California, 591 U.S. 1, 24 (2020)  \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \nSecond, EPA now reads the statutory phrase \u201cthe  \nappropriate circuit\u201d to mean that \u201cany action that spans \nmore than one judicial circuit is properly viewed as \u2018na-\ntionally applicable\u2019 and subject to review only in the D.C. \nCircuit.\u201d U.S. Br. 21-22 (quoting \u00a7 7607(b)(1)). According \nto the government (U.S. Br. 21), \u201c[t]he statute\u2019s use of the \ndefinite article \u2026 indicates that, for any given locally or \nregionally applicable EPA action, there is only one appro-\npriate regional court of appeals in which to seek review.\u201d \nThat reading is incorrect. \nNothing in Section 7607(b)(1) indicates that the phrase \n\u201cthe appropriate circuit\u201d informs the meaning of \u201cnation-\nally applicable,\u201d and the plain meaning of \u201cnationally  \napplicable\u201d contradicts EPA\u2019s reading. \u201cNationally\u201d \nmeans \u201cwith regard to the nation as a whole.\u201d Nationally, \nTHE OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY (1971); see Ken-\ntucky, 123 F.4th at 459 (same). Yet on EPA\u2019s reading, an \naction applying to far less than the whole nation\u2014say, one \napplying only to Mississippi and Alabama\u2014would be  \n\u201cnationally applicable.\u201d That is a stretch, to say the least. \nEven accepting arguendo EPA\u2019s view of the relevant \nfinal action, the April and June 2022 Denials were not \u201cna-\ntionally applicable\u201d because they did not cover the whole \nnation like the enumerated actions in Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s \n\n \n41 \nfirst sentence do. They applied to (and bound) only those \nsmall refineries that petitioned for an exemption. See \nPet.App.11a-12a.  \nThe ordinary meaning of \u201cregionally applicable\u201d also \nrebuts EPA\u2019s proffered reading, because that term con-\ntemplates agency actions applying in multiple places \nwithin a region: \u201cof or pertaining to, or connected with, a \nparticular region.\u201d Regional, THE OXFORD ENGLISH \nDICTIONARY (1971). Indeed, EPA\u2019s attempt to put so \nmuch weight on a single definite article produces textually \nabsurd results. Consider EPA\u2019s 250 air quality control  \nregions, some of which cover large metropolitan areas \nthat happen to cross State (and circuit) lines.10 \u201cMetropol-\nitan St. Louis\u201d (Region 70) and \u201cMetropolitan Kansas City\u201d \n(Region 90) are two examples. Can there be any doubt \nthat an EPA disapproval of a regional implementation \nplan for only Region 90 (Metropolitan Kansas City) is a \n\u201cregionally applicable\u201d action for purposes of Section \n7607(b)(1), even though that action touches both the \nEighth and Tenth Circuits? \nCongress did not think so. The 1970 Senate Report  \ninvoked by the government (U.S. Br. 23) said that \u201cimple-\nmentation plans which run only to one air quality control \nregion\u201d should be reviewed in the circuit court \u201cin which \nthe affected air quality control region, or portion thereof, \nis located.\u201d S. Rep. No. 1196, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 41 (1970) \n(emphasis added). Yet according to the government (U.S. \nBr. 22), the circuit courts governing the States affected by \na Kansas City regional action are powerless because \u201cany \naction that spans more than one judicial circuit\u201d must go \nexclusively to the D.C. Circuit. \n \n10 \nSee \nhttps://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/documents/codeta-\nbles/aqcrs.html. \n\n \n42 \nThe Senate Report supports what ordinary usage sug-\ngests about the meaning of \u201cthe appropriate circuit.\u201d \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1) (emphasis added). The use of \u201cthe appropri-\nate circuit\u201d rather than \u201cthe appropriate circuit(s)\u201d re-\nflects merely that Congress often doesn\u2019t legislate with \nlaser-like precision. E.g., United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. \n336, 344 (1971) (\u201cwe cannot pretend that all statutes are \nmodel statutes\u201d). For most EPA final actions (properly \nidentified), it will be readily apparent whether the action \napplies to the whole nation or to some subset\u2014and in the \nlatter instance, which circuit court is \u201cappropriate.\u201d That \nis certainly true for EPA\u2019s RFS hardship decisions, which \naffect only individual small refineries. \nc. Taken together, EPA\u2019s arguments reveal the \nagency\u2019s conscious desire for the power to choose where \nits actions are reviewed. EPA says (U.S. Br. 28-29) that \n\u201caction \u2026 under this chapter\u201d means its own \u201ccharacteri-\nzation\u201d of an action, which courts cannot \u201csecond-guess.\u201d \nAnd EPA further says (U.S. Br. 22) that any time an  \naction affects states or parties in more than one circuit, it \nis automatically entitled to D.C. Circuit review. If EPA \nwere right about both, then the agency could nearly al-\nways manufacture venue in the D.C. Circuit. EPA could \nsimply mush together two small refineries\u2019 RFS hardship \ndecisions, or decisions on two States\u2019 implementation \nplans\u2014even two decisions that have nothing to do with \neach other\u2014and thereby deny the regulated parties the \nopportunity for review by a regional circuit court. \nThe text of Section 7607(b)(1) does not allow that  \nmanipulation. \u201c[V]enue provisions in Acts of Congress \nshould not be so freely construed as to give the Govern-\nment the choice of \u2018a tribunal favorable\u2019 to it.\u201d Travis v. \nUnited States, 364 U.S. 631, 634 (1961) (citation omitted). \n\n \n43 \n3. The hardship decisions were not based on a \ndetermination of nationwide scope or effect. \nEPA asserts (U.S. Br. 33-35) that its individual denial \ndecisions were based on two determinations of nationwide \nscope or effect: \u201cEPA\u2019s revised interpretation of the rele-\nvant CAA provisions and the RIN discount and RIN cost \npassthrough principles.\u201d Pet.App.187a-188a. That mis-\ncharacterizes both the statutory text and the final actions. \na. As an initial matter, neither EPA\u2019s statutory inter-\npretation nor its economic hypothesis was a statutory  \n\u201cdetermination\u201d as the CAA uses that term of art. See pp. \n32-34, supra. Neither describes any issue that the CAA\u2019s \ntext directed EPA to \u201cdetermine\u201d before acting on a small  \nrefinery\u2019s RFS hardship petition. See \u00a7 7545(o)(9).  \nIn the immediately preceding subsection, Congress  \ninstructed EPA to extend two-year hardship exemptions \nbased on DOE\u2019s \u201cdetermin[ation]\u201d about a small refin-\nery\u2019s hardship. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(A)(ii)(II). And elsewhere in \nthe same Section, Congress authorized EPA to grant cer-\ntain waivers, following consultation with DOE, \u201cbased on \na determination by the Administrator \u2026 that implemen-\ntation of the requirement would severely harm the econ-\nomy or environment of a State, a region, or the United \nStates.\u201d \u00a7 7545(o)(7)(A)(i).  \nCongress thus knows how to make actions \u201cbased on a \ndetermination\u201d when it wants to. It did not do that for \nsmall-refinery hardship petitions in Section 7545(o)(9)(B). \nEPA\u2019s position wrongly depends on treating \u201cdetermina-\ntion\u201d in Section 7607(b)(1) not as a statutory term of art \nbut rather as some amorphous concept of anything that \ncontributed significantly to a final action.  \nb. Even if Section 7607(b)(1) used \u201cdetermination\u201d in \nthe colloquial sense, EPA would still be wrong about the \nbasis for these hardship-petition denial actions. \n\n \n44 \ni. EPA\u2019s first suggestion\u2014that a statutory interpre-\ntation can qualify as a \u201cdetermination of nationwide scope \nor effect\u201d\u2014is nothing less than an argument that every \nEPA action must go to the D.C. Circuit. EPA is a \u201ccrea-\nture[ ] of statute,\u201d so \u201cit possess[es] only the authority that \nCongress has provided.\u201d National Fed\u2019n of Indep. Bus. v. \nDep\u2019t of Lab., Occupational Safety & Health Admin., 595 \nU.S. 109, 117, (2022). Every EPA action is necessarily \n\u201cbased on\u201d the agency\u2019s understanding of its statutory  \nauthority. \nIt similarly cannot be the case (contra U.S. Br. 34) that \nEPA\u2019s denial actions here were based on a nationwide  \ndetermination because EPA applied a statutory interpre-\ntation \u201cuniformly\u201d to them. If EPA had not done that\u2014if \nit had applied a different statutory reading to similarly \nsituated small-refinery petitioners\u2014that would be the \nheight of arbitrariness. So \u201cif application of a national \nstandard \u2026 were the controlling factor, there never could \nbe a local or regional action\u201d because every EPA action \n\u201cpurportedly applies a national standard created by the \nnational statute and its national regulations.\u201d West Vir-\nginia, 90 F.4th at 329-330. This Court should not read the \nnarrow nationwide-scope-or-effect exception to \u201cswallow \nthe\u201d local-or-regionally-applicable rule. Cuomo v. Clear-\ning House Ass\u2019n, L.L.C., 557 U.S. 519, 530 (2009). \nThe most obvious examples of locally applicable  \nactions involve EPA applying a uniform statutory stand-\nard to individual regulated parties\u2019 factual circumstances. \nAccord U.S. Br. 42. Acknowledging that reality, EPA  \nultimately abandons any argument based on application \nof a \u201cuniform\u201d standard, conceding (U.S. Br. 41) that EPA \n\u201cdoes not\u201d make a nationwide-scope determination \u201cwhen \nit merely applies a previously established agency \u2026 inter-\npretation to new \u2018locally or regionally applicable\u2019 circum-\n\n \n45 \nstances.\u201d That describes what EPA did in the final actions \nchallenged here: It applied its statutory interpretation to \neach petitioning small refinery\u2019s evidence about its local \neconomic circumstances. See pp. 34-35, supra. \nInsofar as EPA contends (U.S. Br. 33, 41) that what \nmatters here is that it promulgated its \u201cnew interpreta-\ntion\u201d at \u201croughly the same time\u201d it denied the hardship \npetitions, that argument does not rebut the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \nvenue conclusion. For one thing, that argument would not \nextend to the June 2022 Denial decisions, which merely \napplied the statutory interpretation that EPA had an-\nnounced months earlier in April. Pet.App.80a.11 \nIn any event, EPA\u2019s choice to offer a new statutory \nanalysis cannot alter what determination the statute  \nrequired as the basis for every small-refinery hardship \ndecision. The text does not ask whether the agency made \nsome determination of nationwide scope or effect in con-\nnection with the action. It asks whether EPA \u201cbased\u201d its \nfinal action on such a determination. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). Here, as \nexplained above, the basis for these final actions must by \nlaw be findings about the individual petitioning small  \n \n11  Despite EPA repeatedly referring to the April and June \nDenials as two separate actions, EPA simultaneously argues \nthat those explanation documents should be treated as one for \npurposes of establishing its new adjudication approach to hard-\nship petitions. U.S. Br. 42-43 n.6. EPA urges this Court (ibid.) \nto disregard the \u201ctime that passed between the[ir] finalization\u201d \nbecause \u201c[b]oth denial actions here stemmed from a single \npropos[al].\u201d But obviously one proposal can lead ultimately to \nmultiple final actions. And according to the face of the June  \nexplanation document, it was only the April explanation docu-\nment that broke new ground: \u201cIn this action, EPA is applying \nthe approach proposed on December 7, 2021, and adopted in \nthe April 2022 [RFS] Denial.\u201d Pet.App.80a (emphases added). \n\n \n46 \nrefineries\u2019 economic circumstances. And EPA has admit-\nted that these hardship decisions were based on just that. \nSee p. 34, supra. \nMoreover, EPA\u2019s new statutory interpretation was \nnot sufficient to produce final agency action in this con-\ntext. Recall that EPA could not, and did not, use a rule-\nmaking for its new interpretation\u2014because to do so here \nwould plainly have been illegally retroactive. If EPA had \nwanted judicial review to focus on its new statutory inter-\npretation (U.S. Br. 42), it could have run a (lawful) rule-\nmaking process. But EPA expressly chose to proceed only \nby adjudication. See Pet.App.188 (\u201cThis action is not a \nrulemaking\u201d). That choice meant that EPA could produce \n\u201cfinal action \u2026 under this chapter\u201d not by analyzing the \nstatute but rather only by evaluating the petitioning small \nrefineries\u2019 economic evidence. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). \nIt is also no answer for EPA to contend (U.S. Br. 35, \n42) that a case must go to the D.C. Circuit when \u201ccircum-\nstances suggest\u201d that EPA\u2019s statutory interpretation is \n\u201clikely to be called into question\u201d in the litigation. That \nflies in the face of the courts\u2019 consistent holding (and \nEPA\u2019s consistent position) that what matters is EPA\u2019s  \n\u201cfinal action,\u201d not the petitioner\u2019s arguments challenging \nit. See pp. 7-8, supra. It will not always be apparent at the \noutset of litigation, when venue is typically (and most effi-\nciently) resolved, what aspects of an EPA action will be \ncalled into question. \nThe better answer is the simpler one that also gives \nthe statutory terms their ordinary meaning: An EPA  \naction is based on a determination of nationwide scope or \neffect in the rare instance when the CAA\u2019s text directs \nEPA to make a factual \u201cdetermination\u201d about the entire \nnation or industry, without the need to consider individual \ncircumstances. \n\n \n47 \nii. For many of the same reasons, EPA\u2019s RIN-cost-\npassthrough hypothesis did not make these hardship  \ndenial actions based on a determination of nationwide \nscope or effect. Even if EPA\u2019s passthrough hypothesis \ncould qualify as a \u201cdetermination\u201d under the statute when \nthe text does not describe it that way, see pp. 33-34, supra, \nthe actions denying the hardship petitions were not \n\u201cbased on\u201d it, \u00a7 7607(b)(1). EPA had merely a hypothe-\nsis\u2014an \u201canalysis of how\u201d EPA \u201cexpected\u201d individual fuels \nmarkets to respond, Pet.App.163a-165a\u2014that EPA \nneeded to test, and did test, against each hardship peti-\ntion\u2019s evidence. See pp. 34-35, supra. Only that analysis of \neach refinery\u2019s individual evidence could be the \u201cbas[is]\u201d \nfor \u201cfinal action[s]\u201d denying respondents\u2019 hardship peti-\ntions. \u00a7 7607(b)(1) (emphasis added). \nEPA\u2019s actions were not \u201cbased on\u201d any supposedly  \nnationwide RIN-cost-passthrough determination for the \nadditional reason that, with or without any nationwide  \nassessment, EPA\u2019s denial actions here would have been \nexactly the same. The government agrees (U.S. Br. 41) \nthat the textual \u201ccausation requirement\u201d in Section \n7607(b)(1) means that \u201cthe relevant determinations\u201d must \nbe \u201cat the core of EPA\u2019s action.\u201d But here, EPA did not \nneed any nationwide finding about any other refineries to \nconclude, as it wrongly did in the denial actions, that each \nof the small-refinery respondents were \u201cable to pass along \nRFS compliance costs,\u201d were \u201crecovering [their] costs,\u201d \nand so were suffering \u201cno economic harm.\u201d Pet.App.99a-\n100a, 165a; JA 280.  \nIn short, the conclusion that drove each denial decision \nwas not that all obligated parties recover their RFS costs; \nit was that each of these respondents (purportedly) does. \nAs EPA itself explains (U.S. Br. 10): It denied respond-\nents\u2019 hardship petitions because it \u201cdetermined that none \n\n \n48 \nof the petitioning small refineries had rebutted [the RIN-\ncost-passthrough] presumption through evidence about \ntheir specific circumstances.\u201d Those were conclusions \nabout specific refineries, not nationwide determinations.12 \nc. EPA invokes the history (U.S. Br. 35-38) of the \nthird-sentence exception in Section 7607(b)(1), but that \nhistory actually undermines EPA\u2019s position. As recounted \nabove, the exception was prompted by General Counsel \nFrick\u2019s description of an atypical CAA provision that, \nthough calling for a local action (an extension for specific \nStates), textually required EPA\u2019s action to be based on a \ndetermination about technology available throughout the \nindustry. See pp. 8-9, supra. That extension action did not \nrequire or even contemplate any consideration of individ-\nualized State circumstances; EPA was tasked instead \nwith making a finding about the technology available \nthroughout the nation. \nEPA\u2019s actions on small-refinery hardship petitions \nlook nothing like that. The text of Section 7545(o)(9)(B), \nunlike the unusual provision that Frick described, does \nnot ask EPA to make any \u201cdetermination\u201d about the  \nentire nation or industry as a basis for granting hardship \nrelief. It does not call for any determination at all. To the \nextent it does, it calls for a determination about the indi-\nvidual petitioning small refinery\u2019s economic circum-\nstances. See pp. 33-34, supra. \nEPA responds by catastrophizing (U.S. Br. 38) that if \nthe denials here do not qualify as based on nationwide  \n \n12  EPA\u2019s footnoted discussion (U.S. Br. 34 n.5) of how it \nchooses to respond to granted hardship petitions is irrelevant \nto Section 7607(b)(1), because those downstream choices by the \nagency say nothing about what was the \u201cbas[is]\u201d for the final \ndenial actions here. \n\n \n49 \ndeterminations, then the third-sentence exception to Sec-\ntion 7607(b)(1) will be \u201cpractically insignificant.\u201d But the \nthird sentence was always meant to state an exception to \nthe general rule for locally applicable actions. General \nCounsel Frick urged the exception\u2019s adoption to address \na CAA provision that has since been repealed. That is \nlikely why, before the cases involving EPA\u2019s denial deci-\nsions here, no court had ever found a locally applicable \nEPA action that was based on a determination of nation-\nwide scope or effect. The exception is properly narrow. \nd. EPA concludes by resorting to a policy argument: \nIt asks this Court to read \u201cbased on a determination of  \nnationwide scope or effect\u201d broadly, on the theory that  \njudicial review will be more efficient if the D.C. Circuit \nalone considers issues like EPA\u2019s statutory analysis and \nmethodological framework.  \nAppeals to policy cannot supersede the ordinary \nmeaning of the terms in Section 7607(b)(1) or the confir-\nmation of their meaning in the statutory context and his-\ntory. Niz-Chavez v. Garland, 593 U.S. 155, 171 (2021) (\u201cno \namount of policy-talk can overcome a plain statutory com-\nmand\u201d). And in any event, EPA\u2019s policy argument falls \nflat. If EPA wants to propound a new statutory interpre-\ntation and have it reviewed by only the D.C. Circuit, then \nthe agency need only adopt that interpretation through a \nlawful rulemaking process. \nExperience has proven EPA wrong in suggesting that \nconsolidated D.C. Circuit review of CAA actions is always \nor usually best. The litigation here is a perfect example. \nBecause EPA persuaded several regional circuit courts to \ntransfer small refineries\u2019 challenges to their hardship- \ndenial decisions, the D.C. Circuit ended up hearing one \nmassive case consolidating dozens of small refineries\u2019  \npetitions for review. See p. 18, supra. That consolidation \n\n \n50 \nmade the D.C. Circuit litigation take much longer than \nother small refineries\u2019 regional-circuit challenges to \nEPA\u2019s denials of their hardship petitions.  \nEven more important, consolidation in the D.C. Cir-\ncuit made it very difficult for the individual small refiner-\nies to get judicial attention on what ultimately matters \nmost: their specific economic circumstances that give rise \nto their disproportionate economic hardship from the \nRFS. To take just one example: In the mass D.C. Circuit \nchallenge alongside dozens of co-petitioners, there was no \neasy way for a small refinery affiliated with one respond-\nent here, Calumet Montana, to ask the court to focus on \nthe idiosyncrasies of producing blended diesel fuel in a \ncold climate in winter. Yet that is exactly the sort of con-\ndition that causes Calumet Montana to face dispropor-\ntionate economic hardship from the RFS. \nEPA\u2019s preference for near-universal D.C. Circuit  \nreview would obscure the judiciary\u2019s consideration of  \nindividual regulated entities\u2019 circumstances, contrary to \nthe essential logic of Congress\u2019s plan for a national vs.  \nlocal divide in Section 7607(b)(1). \n\n \n51 \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be af-\nfirmed. \nRespectfully submitted, \nLeAnn M.

An adjustment in the 50 or 60 percent \ngreenhouse gas levels shall be the minimum possible \nadjustment for the fuel or fuels concerned, and the ad-\njusted greenhouse gas reduction shall be established \nat the maximum achievable level, taking cost in con-\nsideration, allowing for the use of a variety of feed-\nstocks, technologies, and processes. \n(D) 5-year review \nWhenever the Administrator makes any adjustment \nunder this paragraph, not later than 5 years thereafter \nhe shall review and revise (based upon the same crite-\nria and standards as required for the initial adjust-\nment) the regulations establishing the adjusted level. \n(E) Subsequent adjustments \nAfter the Administrator has promulgated a final rule \nunder the last sentence of paragraph (2)(A)(i) with re-\nspect to the method of determining lifecycle green-\nhouse gas emissions, except as provided in subpara-\ngraph (D), the Administrator may not adjust the per-\ncent greenhouse gas reduction levels unless he deter-\nmines that there has been a significant change in the \nanalytical methodology used for determining the \nlifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. If he makes such \ndetermination, he may adjust the 20, 50, or 60 percent \nreduction levels through rulemaking using the criteria \nand standards set forth in this paragraph. \n(F) Limit on upward adjustments \nIf, under subparagraph (D) or (E), the Administrator \nrevises a percent level adjusted as provided in subpar-\nagraphs (A), (B), and (C) to a higher percent, such \nhigher percent may not exceed the applicable percent \n\n15a \n \nspecified in paragraph (2)(A)(i), (1)(D), (1)(B)(i), or \n(1)(E). \n(G) Applicability of adjustments \nIf the Administrator adjusts, or revises, a percent \nlevel referred to in this paragraph or makes a change \nin the analytical methodology used for determining \nthe lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions, such adjust-\nment, revision, or change (or any combination thereof) \nshall only apply to renewable fuel from new facilities \nthat commence construction after the effective date of \nsuch adjustment, revision, or change. \n(5) Credit program \n(A) In general \nThe regulations promulgated under paragraph (2)(A) \nshall provide\u2014 \n(i) for the generation of an appropriate amount of \ncredits by any person that refines, blends, or imports \ngasoline that contains a quantity of renewable fuel \nthat is greater than the quantity required under para-\ngraph (2); \n(ii) for the generation of an appropriate amount of \ncredits for biodiesel; and  \n(iii) for the generation of credits by small refiner-\nies in accordance with paragraph (9)(C). \n(B) Use of credits \nA person that generates credits under subparagraph \n(A) may use the credits, or transfer all or a portion of \nthe credits to another person, for the purpose of com-\nplying with paragraph (2). \n\n16a \n \n(C) Duration of credits \nA credit generated under this paragraph shall be valid \nto show compliance for the 12 months as of the date of \ngeneration. \n(D) Inability to generate or purchase sufficient \ncredits \nThe regulations promulgated under paragraph (2)(A) \nshall include provisions allowing any person that is un-\nable to generate or purchase sufficient credits to meet \nthe requirements of paragraph (2) to carry forward a \nrenewable fuel deficit on condition that the person, in \nthe calendar year following the year in which the re-\nnewable fuel deficit is created\u2014 \n(i) achieves compliance with the renewable fuel re-\nquirement under paragraph (2); and \n(ii) generates or purchases additional renewable \nfuel credits to offset the renewable fuel deficit of the \nprevious year. \n(E) Credits for additional renewable fuel \nThe Administrator may issue regulations providing: \n(i) for the generation of an appropriate amount of cred-\nits by any person that refines, blends, or imports addi-\ntional renewable fuels specified by the Administrator; \nand (ii) for the use of such credits by the generator, or \nthe transfer of all or a portion of the credits to another \nperson, for the purpose of complying with paragraph \n(2). \n(6) Seasonal variations in renewable fuel use \n(A) Study \nFor each of calendar years 2006 through 2012, the Ad-\nministrator of the Energy Information Administration \nshall conduct a study of renewable fuel blending to \n\n17a \n \ndetermine whether there are excessive seasonal vari-\nations in the use of renewable fuel. \n(B) Regulation of excessive seasonal variations \nIf, for any calendar year, the Administrator of the En-\nergy Information Administration, based on the study \nunder subparagraph (A), makes the determinations \nspecified in subparagraph (C), the Administrator of \nthe Environmental Protection Agency shall promul-\ngate regulations to ensure that 25 percent or more of \nthe quantity of renewable fuel necessary to meet the \nrequirements of paragraph (2) is used during each of \nthe 2 periods specified in subparagraph (D) of each \nsubsequent calendar year. \n(C) Determinations \nThe determinations referred to in subparagraph (B) \nare that\u2014 \n(i)  less than 25 percent of the quantity of renewa-\nble fuel necessary to meet the requirements of para-\ngraph (2) has been used during 1 of the 2 periods spec-\nified in subparagraph (D) of the calendar year; \n(ii)  a pattern of excessive seasonal variation de-\nscribed in clause (i) will continue in subsequent calen-\ndar years; and promulgating regulations or other re-\nquirements to impose a 25 percent or more seasonal \nuse of renewable fuels will not prevent or interfere \nwith the attainment of national ambient air quality \nstandards or significantly increase the price of motor \nfuels to the consumer. \n(D) Periods \nThe 2 periods referred to in this paragraph are\u2014 \n(i)  April through September; and  \n(ii) January through March and October through \nDecember. \n\n18a \n \n(E) Exclusion \nRenewable fuel blended or consumed in calendar year \n2006 in a State that has received a waiver under sec-\ntion 7543(b) of this title shall not be included in the \nstudy under subparagraph (A). \n(F) State exemption from seasonality require-\nments \nNotwithstanding any other provision of law, the sea-\nsonality requirement relating to renewable fuel use es-\ntablished by this paragraph shall not apply to any \nState that has received a waiver under section 7543(b) \nof this title or any State dependent on refineries in \nsuch State for gasoline supplies. \n(7) Waivers \n(A) In general \nThe Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary \nof Agriculture and the Secretary of Energy, may \nwaive the requirements of paragraph (2) in whole or in \npart on petition by one or more States, by any person \nsubject to the requirements of this subsection, or by \nthe Administrator on his own motion by reducing the \nnational quantity of renewable fuel required under \nparagraph (2)\u2014 \n(i) based on a determination by the Administrator, \nafter public notice and opportunity for comment, that \nimplementation of the requirement would severely \nharm the economy or environment of a State, a region, \nor the United States; or \n(ii) based on a determination by the Administrator, \nafter public notice and opportunity for comment, that \nthere is an inadequate domestic supply. \n\n19a \n \n(B) Petitions for waivers \nThe Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary \nof Agriculture and the Secretary of Energy, shall ap-\nprove or disapprove a petition for a waiver of the re-\nquirements of paragraph (2) within 90 days after the \ndate on which the petition is received by the Adminis-\ntrator. \n(C) Termination of waivers \nA waiver granted under subparagraph (A) shall termi-\nnate after 1 year, but may be renewed by the Admin-\nistrator after consultation with the Secretary of Agri-\nculture and the Secretary of Energy. \n(D) Cellulosic biofuel \n(i) For any calendar year for which the projected \nvolume of cellulosic biofuel production is less than the \nminimum applicable volume established under para-\ngraph (2)(B), as determined by the Administrator \nbased on the estimate provided under paragraph \n(3)(A), not later than November 30 of the preceding \ncalendar year, the Administrator shall reduce the ap-\nplicable volume of cellulosic biofuel required under \nparagraph (2)(B) to the projected volume available \nduring that calendar year. For any calendar year in \nwhich the Administrator makes such a reduction, the \nAdministrator may also reduce the applicable volume \nof renewable fuel and advanced biofuels requirement \nestablished under paragraph (2)(B) by the same or a \nlesser volume. \n(ii) Whenever the Administrator reduces the min-\nimum cellulosic biofuel volume under this subpara-\ngraph, the Administrator shall make available for sale \ncellulosic biofuel credits at the higher of $0.25 per gal-\nlon or the amount by which $3.00 per gallon exceeds \nthe average wholesale price of a gallon of gasoline in \n\n20a \n \nthe United States. Such amounts shall be adjusted for \ninflation by the Administrator for years after 2008. \n(iii)  Eighteen months after December 19, 2007, the \nAdministrator shall promulgate regulations to govern \nthe issuance of credits under this subparagraph. The \nregulations shall set forth the method for determining \nthe exact price of credits in the event of a waiver. The \nprice of such credits shall not be changed more fre-\nquently than once each quarter. These regulations \nshall include such provisions, including limiting the \ncredits\u2019 uses and useful life, as the Administrator \ndeems appropriate to assist market liquidity and \ntransparency, to provide appropriate certainty for \nregulated entities and renewable fuel producers, and \nto limit any potential misuse of cellulosic biofuel cred-\nits to reduce the use of other renewable fuels, and for \nsuch other purposes as the Administrator determines \nwill help achieve the goals of this subsection. The reg-\nulations shall limit the number of cellulosic biofuel \ncredits for any calendar year to the minimum applica-\nble volume (as reduced under this subparagraph) of \ncellulosic biofuel for that year. \n(E) Biomass-based diesel \n(i)  Market evaluation \nThe Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary \nof Energy and the Secretary of Agriculture, shall pe-\nriodically evaluate the impact of the biomass-based \ndiesel requirements established under this paragraph \non the price of diesel fuel. \n(ii)  Waiver \nIf the Administrator determines that there is a signif-\nicant renewable feedstock disruption or other market \ncircumstances that would make the price of biomass-\nbased diesel fuel increase significantly, the Admin- \n\n21a \n \nistrator, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy \nand the Secretary of Agriculture, shall issue an order \nto reduce, for up to a 60-day period, the quantity of bi-\nomass-based diesel required under subparagraph (A) \nby an appropriate quantity that does not exceed 15 \npercent of the applicable annual requirement for bio-\nmass-based diesel. For any calendar year in which the \nAdministrator makes a reduction under this subpara-\ngraph, the Administrator may also reduce the applica-\nble volume of renewable fuel and advanced biofuels re-\nquirement established under paragraph (2)(B) by the \nsame or a lesser volume. \n(iii) Extensions \nIf the Administrator determines that the feedstock \ndisruption or circumstances described in clause (ii) is \ncontinuing beyond the 60-day period described in \nclause (ii) or this clause, the Administrator, in consul-\ntation with the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary \nof Agriculture, may issue an order to reduce, for up to \nan additional 60-day period, the quantity of biomass-\nbased diesel required under subparagraph (A) by an \nappropriate quantity that does not exceed an addi-\ntional 15 percent of the applicable annual requirement \nfor biomass-based diesel. \n(F) Modification of applicable volumes \nFor any of the tables in paragraph (2)(B), if the Ad-\nministrator waives\u2014 \n(i) at least 20 percent of the applicable volume re-\nquirement set forth in any such table for 2 consecutive \nyears; or \n(ii) at least 50 percent of such volume requirement \nfor a single year, the Administrator shall promulgate \na rule (within 1 year after issuing such waiver) that \nmodifies the applicable volumes set forth in the table \n\n22a \n \nconcerned for all years following the final year to \nwhich the waiver applies, except that no such modifi-\ncation in applicable volumes shall be made for any year \nbefore 2016. In promulgating such a rule, the Admin-\nistrator shall comply with the processes, criteria, and \nstandards set forth in paragraph (2)(B)(ii). \n(8) Study and waiver for initial year of program \n(A) In general \nNot later than 180 days after August 8, 2005, the Sec-\nretary of Energy shall conduct for the Administrator \na study assessing whether the renewable fuel require-\nment under paragraph (2) will likely result in signifi-\ncant adverse impacts on consumers in 2006, on a na-\ntional, regional, or State basis. \n(B) Required evaluations \nThe study shall evaluate renewable fuel\u2014 \n(i) supplies and prices; \n(ii) blendstock supplies; and  \n(iii) supply and distribution system capabilities. \n(C) Recommendations by the Secretary \nBased on the results of the study, the Secretary of En-\nergy shall make specific recommendations to the Ad-\nministrator concerning waiver of the requirements of \nparagraph (2), in whole or in part, to prevent any ad-\nverse impacts described in subparagraph (A). \n(D) Waiver \n(i)  In general \nNot later than 270 days after August 8, 2005, the Ad-\nministrator shall, if and to the extent recommended by \nthe Secretary of Energy under subparagraph (C), \nwaive, in whole or in part, the renewable fuel require-\nment under paragraph (2) by reducing the national \n\n23a \n \nquantity of renewable fuel required under paragraph \n(2) in calendar year 2006. \n(ii)  No effect on waiver authority \nClause (i) does not limit the authority of the Adminis-\ntrator to waive the requirements of paragraph (2) in \nwhole, or in part, under paragraph (7). \n(9)  Small refineries \n(A) Temporary exemption \n(i) In general \nThe requirements of paragraph (2) shall not apply to \nsmall refineries until calendar year 2011. \n(ii)  Extension of exemption \n(I) Study by Secretary of Energy \nNot later than December 31, 2008, the Secretary of \nEnergy shall conduct for the Administrator a study to de-\ntermine whether compliance with the requirements of \nparagraph (2) would impose a disproportionate economic \nhardship on small refineries. \n(II) Extension of exemption \nIn the case of a small refinery that the Secretary \nof Energy determines under subclause (I) would be sub-\nject to a disproportionate economic hardship if required \nto comply with paragraph (2), the Administrator shall ex-\ntend the exemption under clause (i) for the small refinery \nfor a period of not less than 2 additional years. \n(B) Petitions based on disproportionate eco-\nnomic hardship \n(i) Extension of exemption \nA small refinery may at any time petition the Admin-\nistrator for an extension of the exemption under \n\n24a \n \nsubparagraph (A) for the reason of disproportionate \neconomic hardship. \n(ii) Evaluation of petitions \nIn evaluating a petition under clause (i), the Adminis-\ntrator, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, \nshall consider the findings of the study under subpar-\nagraph (A)(ii) and other economic factors. \n(iii) Deadline for action on petitions \nThe Administrator shall act on any petition submitted \nby a small refinery for a hardship exemption not later \nthan 90 days after the date of receipt of the petition. \n(C) Credit program \nIf a small refinery notifies the Administrator that the \nsmall refinery waives the exemption under subpara-\ngraph (A), the regulations promulgated under para-\ngraph (2)(A) shall provide for the generation of credits \nby the small refinery under paragraph (5) beginning \nin the calendar year following the date of notification. \n(D) Opt-in for small refineries \nA small refinery shall be subject to the requirements \nof paragraph (2) if the small refinery notifies the Ad-\nministrator that the small refinery waives the exemp-\ntion under subparagraph (A). \n(10)  Ethanol market concentration analysis \n(A) Analysis \n(i) In general \nNot later than 180 days after August 8, 2005, and an-\nnually thereafter, the Federal Trade Commission \nshall perform a market concentration analysis of the \nethanol production industry using the Herfindahl-\nHirschman Index to determine whether there is \n\n25a \n \nsufficient competition among industry participants to \navoid price-setting and other anticompetitive behav-\nior. \n(ii) Scoring \nFor the purpose of scoring under clause (i) using the \nHerfindahl-Hirschman Index, all marketing arrange-\nments among industry participants shall be consid-\nered. \n(B) Report \nNot later than December 1, 2005, and annually there-\nafter, the Federal Trade Commission shall submit to \nCongress and the Administrator a report on the re-\nsults of the market concentration analysis performed \nunder subparagraph (A)(i). \n(11) Periodic reviews \nTo allow for the appropriate adjustment of the re-\nquirements described in subparagraph (B) of para-\ngraph (2), the Administrator shall conduct periodic re-\nviews of\u2014 \n(A) existing technologies;

This self-correction makes it highly probable that the next action will succeed in obtaining this crucial information, thus significantly advancing the task goal.\n\nDesign EIG (0.8): This action demonstrates a core principle of effective agent design: self-reflection and adaptive strategy. The agent recognizes a failed search, analyzes the cause ('too specific'), and devises a more robust heuristic ('broader search... focusing on keywords'). This is a highly generalizable and valuable strategy for any information retrieval task, especially within a complex and variably structured environment like a case docket. It's a prime example of learning from mistakes to improve performance.\n\nJoint EIG (1.5): The action scores highly on both axes because it's a perfect synthesis of task-specific progress and general strategic improvement.

Accessing and analyzing these arguments is essential for a balanced and informed prediction of the outcome. Therefore, the Task EIG is very high, as this information will directly and substantially impact my understanding of the legal merits.

Main Street, Suite 201\nMadison, WI 53703 \n \n\n \nQUESTION PRESENTED \nThe Clean Air Act requires the Environmental Protec-\ntion Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) to grant an exemption from the Act\u2019s \nRenewable Fuel Standard (\u201cRFS\u201d) to a small refinery \nwhen compliance with the RFS would cause the refinery \ndisproportionate economic hardship in a given year.  \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(i). The six small refinery re-\nspondents here separately petitioned EPA for hardship \nexemptions for particular compliance years. EPA con-\ncluded, after \u201cconsider[ing] each [respondent\u2019s] individual \nrefinery information,\u201d that each of the respondents was \nnot entitled to hardship relief and denied the petitions. \nPet.App.14a-15a. Respondents then petitioned for judicial \nreview as permitted by the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1). The question presented is:  \nWhether an EPA decision denying a small refinery\u2019s \nRFS hardship petition is a \u201clocally or regionally applica-\nble\u201d action, such that a court challenge to that action is \nproperly venued in a regional circuit court, or is instead a \n\u201cnationally applicable\u201d action or an action \u201cbased on a  \ndetermination of nationwide scope or effect\u201d that must be \nchallenged only in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. \nCircuit. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). \n \n \n\n \nii \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nStatutory Provision Involved ............................................. 1 \nIntroduction ......................................................................... 3 \nStatement ............................................................................. 6 \nA.

A petition for review of the Administrator\u2019s  \naction in approving or promulgating any implementation \nplan under section 7410 of this title or section 7411(d) of \nthis title, any order under section 7411(j) of this title,  \nunder section 7412 of this title, under section 7419 of this \ntitle, or under section 7420 of this title, or his action under \nsection 1857c-10(c)(2)(A), (B), or (C) of this title (as in  \neffect before August 7, 1977) or under regulations there-\nunder, or revising regulations for enhanced monitoring \nand compliance certification programs under section \n7414(a)(3) of this title, or any other final action of the  \nAdministrator under this chapter (including any denial or \ndisapproval by the Administrator under subchapter I) \nwhich is locally or regionally applicable may be filed only \nin the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate \ncircuit. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence a petition \nfor review of any action referred to in such sentence may \nbe filed only in the United States Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia if such action is based on a determi-\nnation of nationwide scope or effect and if in taking such \naction the Administrator finds and publishes that such  \naction is based on such a determination. \n* \nThis and other pertinent statutory provisions are  \nreprinted in the appendix to this brief. App.1a-31a, infra. \n \n \n\n \n3 \nINTRODUCTION \nThe Clean Air Act (\u201cCAA\u201d or \u201cAct\u201d) assigns the venue \nfor a petition for judicial review of final agency action by \nasking whether the challenged action is \u201cnationally appli-\ncable\u201d (reviewed by the D.C. Circuit) or \u201clocally or region-\nally applicable\u201d (reviewed by the regional circuit courts). \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1).1 Determining venue thus requires \nfocusing with precision on the \u201caction\u201d that the Environ-\nmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) was authorized by the \nCAA to take: the \u201cfinal action taken \u2026 under this chap-\nter.\u201d Ibid. (\u201c[T]his chapter\u201d is the CAA.) \nOnce the final action is properly identified, the venue \nprovision is straightforward. Most EPA actions under the \nAct are rulemakings or similar actions that apply through-\nout the entire nation, or else are adjudications or similar \ndecisions involving individual States or regulated entities. \nThe former go to the D.C. Circuit, the latter to the re-\ngional circuit courts\u2014save only in the exceptional circum-\nstance where the CAA\u2019s text directs EPA to base a local \naction on a \u201cdetermination\u201d about the whole nation. \nApplying those statutory instructions here shows why \nthe Fifth Circuit below got the venue question right. This \ncase concerns a type of statutory forbearance from the \nCAA\u2019s Renewable Fuel Standard (\u201cRFS\u201d) that affects \nonly small refineries. Small refineries like respondents \nmay petition EPA for an exemption from the RFS obliga-\ntion by showing that they will face disproportionate eco-\nnomic hardship from compliance with the RFS in a given \nyear. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(A)-(B). Until a presidential administra-\ntion change in 2021, EPA had repeatedly acknowledged \nthat its decisions on small refineries\u2019 hardship petitions \n \n1  All statutory citations are to Title 42 of the United States \nCode. \n\n \n4 \nare quintessential locally applicable actions that Section \n7607(b)(1) refers to the regional circuits. That\u2019s because \neach EPA \u201cfinal action\u201d on a hardship-exemption petition \nadjudicates the rights of only one small refinery located in \none place, and the \u201cchapter\u201d (the CAA) requires those ac-\ntions to be based on consideration of each small refinery\u2019s \nown economic hardship. \u00a7 7607(b)(1); see \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B). \nEPA changed its position on venue and started delib-\nerately attempting to re-direct judicial challenges to its \npreferred court, the D.C. Circuit, only after it suffered a \nstring of defeats in regional circuit courts that found EPA \nhad wrongly decided hardship petitions. EPA now argues \nthat, because it published its decisions on multiple small \nrefineries\u2019 pending hardship petitions bundled together in \ntwo explanation documents (denying every pending peti-\ntion), it was able to convert what it has long agreed were \nlocally applicable final actions into just two nationally  \napplicable actions. EPA was transparent about its goal of \nmaking the D.C. Circuit the only court allowed to review \nits latest denial decisions. \nEPA\u2019s new venue position is contrary to the CAA\u2019s \ntext, and the Fifth Circuit correctly rejected it. EPA was \nable to produce the bundled decisions only by ignoring the \nstatutory command to decide hardship petitions individu-\nally as they come in. More fundamentally, the two expla-\nnation documents were bundles of individual final actions \nunder the CAA. EPA\u2019s choice about how to publish its  \ndecisions cannot change the nature of the \u201cfinal action \ntaken \u2026 under this chapter,\u201d which is what matters for \nvenue. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). It is the statutory text\u2014\u201cth[e] chap-\nter\u201d\u2014that establishes what actions EPA is permitted to \ntake. And here, every relevant provision of the chapter \nconfirms that EPA was required to produce individualized \n\n \n5 \nfinal actions based on individual petitioning refineries\u2019 \neconomic circumstances.  \nIn fact, that is just what EPA did. EPA itself has \nstated that it denied all of the small-refinery respondents\u2019 \nRFS hardship petitions because it \u201cdetermin[ed],\u201d after \n\u201cconsider[ing] each [refinery\u2019s] individual refinery infor-\nmation,\u201d that each respondent was not experiencing dis-\nproportionate economic hardship. Pet.App.14a-15a. EPA \nconcluded, after examining each respondent\u2019s evidence, \nthat each ostensibly passes on 100% of its RFS compliance \ncosts in the price of the fuel it sells. Those were the con-\nclusions on which EPA based its decisions to deny hard-\nship relief to these small-refinery respondents, each of \nwhich received an individualized explanation from EPA \nanalyzing its own economic evidence. \nMultiple courts of appeals (including the D.C. Circuit) \nhave since held that EPA\u2019s merits reasoning about the \nsmall refineries\u2019 ability to pass through their RFS compli-\nance costs was arbitrary and capricious and unsupported \nby the record evidence. But the venue issue before this \nCourt is simpler. To borrow Judge Silberman\u2019s descrip-\ntion of the venue provision that EPA endorses (U.S. Br. \n18): EPA\u2019s answer to whether a petitioning small refinery \nlike Calumet Shreveport located in Shreveport, Louisi-\nana, does or does not successfully pass through its RFS \ncompliance costs in its fuel sales hardly qualifies as a \u201creg-\nulatory issue[ ] of national importance\u201d that belongs in the \nD.C. Circuit. National Env\u2019t Dev. Ass\u2019ns Clean Air Pro-\nject v. EPA, 891 F.3d. 1041, 1054 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (Silber-\nman, J., concurring). \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment should be affirmed. \n\n \n6 \nSTATEMENT \nA. Statutory and regulatory background \n1. Venue for petitions for review under the Clean \nAir Act \nSection 7607(b)(1) governs \u201c[j]udicial review\u201d of \u201cpeti-\ntions for review\u201d of EPA\u2019s \u201cfinal action[s] under this chap-\nter,\u201d i.e., under the Clean Air Act. See Kentucky v. EPA, \n123 F.4th 447, 458, 461 (6th Cir. 2024); 42 U.S.C. Ch. 85, \nCodification Note (\u201cthis chapter\u201d is the CAA). As relevant \nhere, Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s venue instructions consist of \nthree \u201clengthy\u201d sentences. Kentucky, 123 F.4th at 458.  \na. The first sentence describes the proper venue for \nchallenging EPA final actions that apply to the nation as \na whole. That sentence begins by enumerating several \nCAA provisions authorizing EPA to take national actions. \nFor example, when EPA promulgates a national primary \nor secondary air quality standard under Section 7412, or \nsets a standard of performance for all new stationary \nsources of emissions under Section 7411, challenges to \nthose national actions \u201cmay be filed only in\u201d the D.C. Cir-\ncuit. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). In 1977, Congress amended the venue \nprovision to add a catchall phrase to that sentence: In  \naddition to the enumerated national actions, \u201cany other \nnationally applicable regulations promulgated, or final  \naction taken, by the Administrator under this chapter\u201d \nare reviewable only in the D.C. Circuit. Ibid.; see Clean \nAir Act Amendments of 1977, Pub. L. No. 95-95, 91 Stat. \n685 (Aug. 7, 1977).2 \n \n \n2  For ease of reference, the 1970 and 1982 versions of the \nvenue provision (the latter including the 1977 amendments) are \nprovided at App., infra, 29a and 30a, respectively. \n\n \n7 \nb. The second sentence follows the same basic struc-\nture but for non-national final agency actions. It first enu-\nmerates CAA provisions authorizing EPA to take actions \nthat apply to less than the whole country, and it makes \nthose actions reviewable only in regional circuit courts. \nFor example, when EPA approves or promulgates a state \nimplementation plan under Sections 7410 or 7411(d), a \nchallenge to that action \u201cmay be filed only in the United \nStates Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit.\u201d \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1). The second sentence of Section 7607(b)(1), \nlike the first, also includes a catchall phrase added by the \nsame 1977 amendment: \u201cany other final action of the  \nAdministrator under this chapter \u2026 which is locally or  \nregionally applicable\u201d is reviewable only in \u201cthe appropri-\nate circuit\u201d court. Ibid.  \nIdentifying which circuit court is \u201cappropriate\u201d for  \nreviewing local or regional final action is usually easy. \nThat\u2019s because for these EPA actions, the relevant sub-\nstantive CAA provision makes it clear that the action  \naffects particular regulated facilities or States, each of \nwhich is governed by a regional circuit court. When EPA \npromulgates a regional action that happens to touch more \nthan one federal circuit\u2014for example, approving or re-\njecting an implementation plan for the Metropolitan Kan-\nsas City air-quality-control region\u2014there may be more \nthan one appropriate circuit. \nc. The courts of appeals and EPA agree that, to  \nassess the national vs. local applicability of an EPA action \nfor purposes of Section 7607(b)(1), courts look only \u201cto the \nface\u201d of the action as that action is authorized by the \nCAA\u2014not to the challenger\u2019s arguments in the petition \nfor review, and not to the effects of the action or the rea-\nsoning within it. American Rd. & Transp. Builders Ass\u2019n \nv. EPA, 705 F.3d 453, 456 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (Kavanaugh, \n\n \n8 \nJ.); see also, e.g., ATK Launch Sys., Inc. v. EPA, 651 F.3d \n1194, 1197 (10th Cir. 2011); U.S. Br. 20 (invoking \u201cthe face \nof \u201d the actions). That focus on what action EPA took fol-\nlows from the statutory instruction to look to the \u201cfinal ac-\ntion \u2026 under this chapter\u201d to resolve venue. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). \nThe textual structure of Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s first two \nsentences\u2014enumerated lists of CAA actions followed by \ncatchall phrases\u2014indicates that courts should apply the \ncatchall phrases by reasoning by analogy to the enumer-\nated provisions. The catchall phrases use a \u201ccollective \nterm\u201d\u2014any other final action\u2014\u201cat the end of a list of spe-\ncific items,\u201d so the collective term is \u201ccontrolled and  \ndefined by reference to the specific classes that precede \nit.\u201d Fischer v. United States, 603 U.S. 480, 487 (2024) \n(ejusdem generis canon) (cleaned up); see Kentucky, 123 \nF.4th at 460 (using ejusdem generis to interpret Section \n7607(b)(1)). Thus, an EPA final action pursuant to an  \nunenumerated CAA provision is \u201cnationally applicable\u201d if \nit applies to the whole nation like the enumerated actions \nin the first sentence of Section 7607(b)(1) do. And a final  \naction is \u201clocally or regionally applicable\u201d if it applies to \nless than the whole nation, as the enumerated CAA  \nactions in the second sentence do. Ibid. \nd. The third sentence contemplates a narrow excep-\ntion for certain rare EPA actions that, though locally or \nregionally applicable, are \u201cbased on a determination of  \nnationwide scope or effect.\u201d \u00a7 7607(b)(1). That sentence \nwas added by the same 1977 amendment referenced \nabove, prompted by a recommendation from the Adminis-\ntrative Conference of the United States that included a \nstatement from EPA General Counsel William Frick. See \n41 Fed. Reg. 56,767 (Dec. 30, 1976).  \nFrick had identified a circumstance where the third-\nsentence exception was needed. 41 Fed. Reg. at 56,768-\n\n \n9 \n56,769. Under a particular CAA provision at the time \n(since repealed), EPA could grant extensions of a State\u2019s \nattainment date for certain national ambient air quality \nstandards\u2014actions that were locally applicable\u2014only \u201cif \nafter review ... the Administrator determine[d] that,\u201d \namong other things, regulated emission sources were  \n\u201cunable to comply with the [applicable] requirements \u2026 \nbecause the necessary technology or other alternatives \nare not available or will not be available soon enough to \npermit compliance.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857c-5(e) (1973) (empha-\nsis added); see NRDC v. EPA, 475 F.2d 968 (D.C. Cir. \n1973) (explaining the available-technology determination \nand corresponding extension action). \nFrick\u2019s statement, which the government agrees (U.S. \nBr. 37) was the genesis of the third sentence in Sec-\ntion 7607(b)(1), illustrates how that exception works: If \nthe statutory text requires a particular EPA action to \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Main Street, Suite 201\nMadison, WI 53703 \n \n\n \nQUESTION PRESENTED \nThe Clean Air Act requires the Environmental Protec-\ntion Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) to grant an exemption from the Act\u2019s \nRenewable Fuel Standard (\u201cRFS\u201d) to a small refinery \nwhen compliance with the RFS would cause the refinery \ndisproportionate economic hardship in a given year.  \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(i). The six small refinery re-\nspondents here separately petitioned EPA for hardship \nexemptions for particular compliance years. EPA con-\ncluded, after \u201cconsider[ing] each [respondent\u2019s] individual \nrefinery information,\u201d that each of the respondents was \nnot entitled to hardship relief and denied the petitions. \nPet.App.14a-15a. Respondents then petitioned for judicial \nreview as permitted by the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1). The question presented is:  \nWhether an EPA decision denying a small refinery\u2019s \nRFS hardship petition is a \u201clocally or regionally applica-\nble\u201d action, such that a court challenge to that action is \nproperly venued in a regional circuit court, or is instead a \n\u201cnationally applicable\u201d action or an action \u201cbased on a  \ndetermination of nationwide scope or effect\u201d that must be \nchallenged only in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. \nCircuit. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). \n \n \n\n \nii \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nStatutory Provision Involved ............................................. 1 \nIntroduction ......................................................................... 3 \nStatement ............................................................................. 6 \nA.

Notwithstanding the preceding sentence a petition \nfor review of any action referred to in such sentence may \nbe filed only in the United States Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia if such action is based on a determi-\nnation of nationwide scope or effect and if in taking such \naction the Administrator finds and publishes that such  \naction is based on such a determination. \n* \nThis and other pertinent statutory provisions are  \nreprinted in the appendix to this brief. App.1a-31a, infra. \n \n \n\n \n3 \nINTRODUCTION \nThe Clean Air Act (\u201cCAA\u201d or \u201cAct\u201d) assigns the venue \nfor a petition for judicial review of final agency action by \nasking whether the challenged action is \u201cnationally appli-\ncable\u201d (reviewed by the D.C. Circuit) or \u201clocally or region-\nally applicable\u201d (reviewed by the regional circuit courts). \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1).1 Determining venue thus requires \nfocusing with precision on the \u201caction\u201d that the Environ-\nmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) was authorized by the \nCAA to take: the \u201cfinal action taken \u2026 under this chap-\nter.\u201d Ibid. (\u201c[T]his chapter\u201d is the CAA.) \nOnce the final action is properly identified, the venue \nprovision is straightforward. Most EPA actions under the \nAct are rulemakings or similar actions that apply through-\nout the entire nation, or else are adjudications or similar \ndecisions involving individual States or regulated entities. \nThe former go to the D.C. Circuit, the latter to the re-\ngional circuit courts\u2014save only in the exceptional circum-\nstance where the CAA\u2019s text directs EPA to base a local \naction on a \u201cdetermination\u201d about the whole nation. \nApplying those statutory instructions here shows why \nthe Fifth Circuit below got the venue question right. This \ncase concerns a type of statutory forbearance from the \nCAA\u2019s Renewable Fuel Standard (\u201cRFS\u201d) that affects \nonly small refineries. Small refineries like respondents \nmay petition EPA for an exemption from the RFS obliga-\ntion by showing that they will face disproportionate eco-\nnomic hardship from compliance with the RFS in a given \nyear. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(A)-(B). Until a presidential administra-\ntion change in 2021, EPA had repeatedly acknowledged \nthat its decisions on small refineries\u2019 hardship petitions \n \n1  All statutory citations are to Title 42 of the United States \nCode. \n\n \n4 \nare quintessential locally applicable actions that Section \n7607(b)(1) refers to the regional circuits. That\u2019s because \neach EPA \u201cfinal action\u201d on a hardship-exemption petition \nadjudicates the rights of only one small refinery located in \none place, and the \u201cchapter\u201d (the CAA) requires those ac-\ntions to be based on consideration of each small refinery\u2019s \nown economic hardship. \u00a7 7607(b)(1); see \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B). \nEPA changed its position on venue and started delib-\nerately attempting to re-direct judicial challenges to its \npreferred court, the D.C. Circuit, only after it suffered a \nstring of defeats in regional circuit courts that found EPA \nhad wrongly decided hardship petitions. EPA now argues \nthat, because it published its decisions on multiple small \nrefineries\u2019 pending hardship petitions bundled together in \ntwo explanation documents (denying every pending peti-\ntion), it was able to convert what it has long agreed were \nlocally applicable final actions into just two nationally  \napplicable actions. EPA was transparent about its goal of \nmaking the D.C. Circuit the only court allowed to review \nits latest denial decisions. \nEPA\u2019s new venue position is contrary to the CAA\u2019s \ntext, and the Fifth Circuit correctly rejected it. EPA was \nable to produce the bundled decisions only by ignoring the \nstatutory command to decide hardship petitions individu-\nally as they come in. More fundamentally, the two expla-\nnation documents were bundles of individual final actions \nunder the CAA. EPA\u2019s choice about how to publish its  \ndecisions cannot change the nature of the \u201cfinal action \ntaken \u2026 under this chapter,\u201d which is what matters for \nvenue. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). It is the statutory text\u2014\u201cth[e] chap-\nter\u201d\u2014that establishes what actions EPA is permitted to \ntake. And here, every relevant provision of the chapter \nconfirms that EPA was required to produce individualized \n\n \n5 \nfinal actions based on individual petitioning refineries\u2019 \neconomic circumstances.  \nIn fact, that is just what EPA did. EPA itself has \nstated that it denied all of the small-refinery respondents\u2019 \nRFS hardship petitions because it \u201cdetermin[ed],\u201d after \n\u201cconsider[ing] each [refinery\u2019s] individual refinery infor-\nmation,\u201d that each respondent was not experiencing dis-\nproportionate economic hardship. Pet.App.14a-15a. EPA \nconcluded, after examining each respondent\u2019s evidence, \nthat each ostensibly passes on 100% of its RFS compliance \ncosts in the price of the fuel it sells. Those were the con-\nclusions on which EPA based its decisions to deny hard-\nship relief to these small-refinery respondents, each of \nwhich received an individualized explanation from EPA \nanalyzing its own economic evidence. \nMultiple courts of appeals (including the D.C. Circuit) \nhave since held that EPA\u2019s merits reasoning about the \nsmall refineries\u2019 ability to pass through their RFS compli-\nance costs was arbitrary and capricious and unsupported \nby the record evidence. But the venue issue before this \nCourt is simpler. To borrow Judge Silberman\u2019s descrip-\ntion of the venue provision that EPA endorses (U.S. Br. \n18): EPA\u2019s answer to whether a petitioning small refinery \nlike Calumet Shreveport located in Shreveport, Louisi-\nana, does or does not successfully pass through its RFS \ncompliance costs in its fuel sales hardly qualifies as a \u201creg-\nulatory issue[ ] of national importance\u201d that belongs in the \nD.C. Circuit. National Env\u2019t Dev. Ass\u2019ns Clean Air Pro-\nject v. EPA, 891 F.3d. 1041, 1054 (D.C.

Venue for petitions for review under the Clean \nAir Act \nSection 7607(b)(1) governs \u201c[j]udicial review\u201d of \u201cpeti-\ntions for review\u201d of EPA\u2019s \u201cfinal action[s] under this chap-\nter,\u201d i.e., under the Clean Air Act. See Kentucky v. EPA, \n123 F.4th 447, 458, 461 (6th Cir. 2024); 42 U.S.C. Ch. 85, \nCodification Note (\u201cthis chapter\u201d is the CAA). As relevant \nhere, Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s venue instructions consist of \nthree \u201clengthy\u201d sentences. Kentucky, 123 F.4th at 458.  \na. The first sentence describes the proper venue for \nchallenging EPA final actions that apply to the nation as \na whole. That sentence begins by enumerating several \nCAA provisions authorizing EPA to take national actions. \nFor example, when EPA promulgates a national primary \nor secondary air quality standard under Section 7412, or \nsets a standard of performance for all new stationary \nsources of emissions under Section 7411, challenges to \nthose national actions \u201cmay be filed only in\u201d the D.C. Cir-\ncuit. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). In 1977, Congress amended the venue \nprovision to add a catchall phrase to that sentence: In  \naddition to the enumerated national actions, \u201cany other \nnationally applicable regulations promulgated, or final  \naction taken, by the Administrator under this chapter\u201d \nare reviewable only in the D.C. Circuit. Ibid.; see Clean \nAir Act Amendments of 1977, Pub. L. No. 95-95, 91 Stat. \n685 (Aug. 7, 1977).2 \n \n \n2  For ease of reference, the 1970 and 1982 versions of the \nvenue provision (the latter including the 1977 amendments) are \nprovided at App., infra, 29a and 30a, respectively. \n\n \n7 \nb. The second sentence follows the same basic struc-\nture but for non-national final agency actions. It first enu-\nmerates CAA provisions authorizing EPA to take actions \nthat apply to less than the whole country, and it makes \nthose actions reviewable only in regional circuit courts. \nFor example, when EPA approves or promulgates a state \nimplementation plan under Sections 7410 or 7411(d), a \nchallenge to that action \u201cmay be filed only in the United \nStates Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit.\u201d \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1). The second sentence of Section 7607(b)(1), \nlike the first, also includes a catchall phrase added by the \nsame 1977 amendment: \u201cany other final action of the  \nAdministrator under this chapter \u2026 which is locally or  \nregionally applicable\u201d is reviewable only in \u201cthe appropri-\nate circuit\u201d court. Ibid.  \nIdentifying which circuit court is \u201cappropriate\u201d for  \nreviewing local or regional final action is usually easy. \nThat\u2019s because for these EPA actions, the relevant sub-\nstantive CAA provision makes it clear that the action  \naffects particular regulated facilities or States, each of \nwhich is governed by a regional circuit court. When EPA \npromulgates a regional action that happens to touch more \nthan one federal circuit\u2014for example, approving or re-\njecting an implementation plan for the Metropolitan Kan-\nsas City air-quality-control region\u2014there may be more \nthan one appropriate circuit. \nc. The courts of appeals and EPA agree that, to  \nassess the national vs. local applicability of an EPA action \nfor purposes of Section 7607(b)(1), courts look only \u201cto the \nface\u201d of the action as that action is authorized by the \nCAA\u2014not to the challenger\u2019s arguments in the petition \nfor review, and not to the effects of the action or the rea-\nsoning within it. American Rd. & Transp. Builders Ass\u2019n \nv. EPA, 705 F.3d 453, 456 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (Kavanaugh, \n\n \n8 \nJ.); see also, e.g., ATK Launch Sys., Inc. v. EPA, 651 F.3d \n1194, 1197 (10th Cir. 2011); U.S. Br. 20 (invoking \u201cthe face \nof \u201d the actions). That focus on what action EPA took fol-\nlows from the statutory instruction to look to the \u201cfinal ac-\ntion \u2026 under this chapter\u201d to resolve venue. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). \nThe textual structure of Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s first two \nsentences\u2014enumerated lists of CAA actions followed by \ncatchall phrases\u2014indicates that courts should apply the \ncatchall phrases by reasoning by analogy to the enumer-\nated provisions. The catchall phrases use a \u201ccollective \nterm\u201d\u2014any other final action\u2014\u201cat the end of a list of spe-\ncific items,\u201d so the collective term is \u201ccontrolled and  \ndefined by reference to the specific classes that precede \nit.\u201d Fischer v. United States, 603 U.S. 480, 487 (2024) \n(ejusdem generis canon) (cleaned up); see Kentucky, 123 \nF.4th at 460 (using ejusdem generis to interpret Section \n7607(b)(1)). Thus, an EPA final action pursuant to an  \nunenumerated CAA provision is \u201cnationally applicable\u201d if \nit applies to the whole nation like the enumerated actions \nin the first sentence of Section 7607(b)(1) do. And a final  \naction is \u201clocally or regionally applicable\u201d if it applies to \nless than the whole nation, as the enumerated CAA  \nactions in the second sentence do. Ibid. \nd. The third sentence contemplates a narrow excep-\ntion for certain rare EPA actions that, though locally or \nregionally applicable, are \u201cbased on a determination of  \nnationwide scope or effect.\u201d \u00a7 7607(b)(1). That sentence \nwas added by the same 1977 amendment referenced \nabove, prompted by a recommendation from the Adminis-\ntrative Conference of the United States that included a \nstatement from EPA General Counsel William Frick. See \n41 Fed. Reg. 56,767 (Dec. 30, 1976).  \nFrick had identified a circumstance where the third-\nsentence exception was needed. 41 Fed. Reg. at 56,768-\n\n \n9 \n56,769. Under a particular CAA provision at the time \n(since repealed), EPA could grant extensions of a State\u2019s \nattainment date for certain national ambient air quality \nstandards\u2014actions that were locally applicable\u2014only \u201cif \nafter review ... the Administrator determine[d] that,\u201d \namong other things, regulated emission sources were  \n\u201cunable to comply with the [applicable] requirements \u2026 \nbecause the necessary technology or other alternatives \nare not available or will not be available soon enough to \npermit compliance.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857c-5(e) (1973) (empha-\nsis added); see NRDC v. EPA, 475 F.2d 968 (D.C. Cir. \n1973) (explaining the available-technology determination \nand corresponding extension action). \nFrick\u2019s statement, which the government agrees (U.S. \nBr. 37) was the genesis of the third sentence in Sec-\ntion 7607(b)(1), illustrates how that exception works: If \nthe statutory text requires a particular EPA action to be \nbased on a statutory \u201cdetermination\u201d about a circum-\nstance equally affecting the whole nation, then a chal-\nlenge to that action should go to the D.C. Circuit. \nCongress provided that \u201cif \u201d a locally applicable action \u201cis \nbased on a determination of nationwide scope or effect and \nif in taking such action [EPA] finds and publishes that \nsuch action is based on such a determination,\u201d then the \nproper venue is the D.C. Circuit. \u00a7 7607(b)(1).  \nThe third sentence thus establishes two independent \nrequirements for this exception: the action must actually \nbe based on a determination of nationwide scope or effect, \nand EPA must publish a finding that it is so based. Accord \nU.S. Br. 30. Whether EPA publishes that finding is the \nonly part of Section 7607(b)(1) that contemplates any dis-\ncretion for the agency. The text is thus \u201cclear\u201d that \u201c[t]he \ncourt\u2014not EPA\u2014determines both the scope of an  \naction\u2019s applicability and whether it was based on a deter-\n\n \n10 \nmination of nationwide scope or effect.\u201d Texas v. EPA \n(\u201cTexas 2020\u201d), 983 F.3d 826, 833 (5th Cir. 2020); accord  \nSierra Club v. EPA, 47 F.4th 738, 746 (D.C. Cir. 2022). \ne. In sum, the CAA allocates venue for regulatory \nchallenges depending on the nature of the \u201cfinal action\u201d \nunder review: If EPA\u2019s \u201cfinal action \u2026 under this chap-\nter\u201d is \u201cnationally applicable,\u201d then the proper venue is \nthe D.C. Circuit. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). If EPA\u2019s \u201cfinal action \u2026  \nunder this chapter\u201d is \u201clocally or regionally applicable,\u201d \nthen the proper venue is presumptively a regional circuit \ncourt. Ibid.; see Texas v. EPA (\u201cTexas 2016\u201d), 829 F.3d \n405, 419, 424 (5th Cir. 2016). If EPA can demonstrate both \nthat a locally applicable action is \u201cbased on a determina-\ntion of nationwide scope or effect\u201d\u2014that is, a textually \ncalled for determination reaching all the nation\u2019s regu-\nlated parties equally\u2014\u201cand\u201d that EPA \u201cf [ound] and pub-\nlishe[d] that such action is based on such a determination,\u201d \nthen venue is proper in the D.C. Circuit. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). \nThe first question for venue, then, is: What is the \u201cfinal \naction \u2026 under this chapter\u201d that EPA was authorized to \ntake? To answer that question, courts \u201clook primarily to \nthe text of the statute,\u201d specifically to the relevant CAA \nprovision that is \u201cthe legal source of [EPA\u2019s] authority to \ntake the challenged action[ ].\u201d Texas v. EPA (\u201cTexas \n2023\u201d), No. 23-60069, 2023 WL 7204840, at *4 (5th Cir. \nMay 1, 2023); see Kentucky, 123 F.4th at 460-462; West \nVirginia v. EPA, 90 F.4th 323, 329 (4th Cir. 2024). \n2. Small-refinery hardship petitions under the \nAct\u2019s RFS Program \na. The CAA\u2019s RFS program requires that increasing \namounts of renewable fuels be blended into the transpor-\ntation fuel (gasoline and diesel) sold in the United States. \n\u00a7 7545(o)(2)(A)(i), (B)(i)(I)-(IV); see HollyFrontier Chey-\nenne Refin., LLC v. Renewable Fuels Ass\u2019n, 594 U.S. 382, \n\n \n11 \n385-387 (2021). EPA first sets annual renewable fuel per-\ncentage standards across the industry. \u00a7 7545(o)(3). Obli-\ngated parties\u2014refiners and importers of transportation \nfuel\u2014use those standards to learn their own annual vol-\nume obligations for each renewable-fuel category. See 40 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 80.1406. \nObligated parties comply with their annual RFS obli-\ngations by \u201cretiring\u201d credits called renewable identifica-\ntion numbers (\u201cRINs\u201d). 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 80.1427. A RIN is \ngenerated when renewable fuel (ethanol, for example) is \nmanufactured. Id. \u00a7 80.1426. The RIN remains attached \nto the volume of renewable fuel until it is blended into \ntransportation fuel, at which point the RIN is \u201csepa-\nrated.\u201d Id. \u00a7\u00a7 80.1428, 80.1429. RINs have a limited life; \nthey can be used for compliance only in the year they are \ngenerated or the next compliance year. \u00a7 7545(o)(5)(C). \nObligated parties demonstrate RFS compliance by secur-\ning sufficient separated RINs, either by generating RINs \nthrough blending renewable fuels or by purchasing RINs \nfrom others that blend. \u00a7 7545(o)(5)(B). \nb. \u201cThe RFS program reflects a carefully crafted leg-\nislative bargain to promote renewable fuels, but also to \nprovide an exemption mechanism for small refineries.\u201d \nSinclair Wyoming Refin. Co. LLC v. EPA, 114 F.4th 693, \n711 (D.C. Cir. 2024). A \u201csmall refinery\u201d has an average \naggregate daily crude oil throughput for a calendar year \nof 75,000 barrels or less. \u00a7 7545(o)(1)(K). Congress recog-\nnized that \u201cescalating [RFS] obligations could work spe-\ncial burdens on small refineries,\u201d many of which \u201clack the \ninherent scale advantages of large refineries\u201d and are lim-\nited in their ability to blend renewable fuels\u2014or are una-\nble to blend at all. HollyFrontier, 594 U.S. at 386 (cleaned \nup). Congress also understood that small refineries are \n\n \n12 \nessential to the nation\u2019s energy supply and often \u201ca major \nsource of jobs in rural communities.\u201d Id. at 386-387. \nEPA has acknowledged that \u201c[m]any\u201d small refineries \n\u201cdo not have access to renewable fuels or the ability to \nblend them, and so must use credits to comply\u201d with the \nRFS. 72 Fed. Reg. 23,900, 23,904 (May 1, 2007). Small  \nrefineries that cannot separate enough RINs through \nblending are forced to buy RINs on an unregulated sec-\nondary market where prices can fluctuate wildly. See 75 \nFed. Reg. 14,670, 14,722 (Mar. 26, 2010) (explaining RIN \nspot markets); HollyFrontier, 594 U.S. at 398 (noting one \nyear where RIN prices \u201cshot up by as much as 100%\u201d). \nCongress initially exempted all small refineries from \nthe RFS until 2011, and it directed the U.S. Department \nof Energy (\u201cDOE\u201d) to study whether RFS compliance \nwould impose disproportionate economic hardship on \nsmall refineries. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(A). DOE completed that \nstudy in 2011, finding that small refineries \u201chave particu-\nlar obstacles that would make compliance more costly \nthan those of large integrated companies.\u201d DOE, Small \nRefinery Exemption Study: An Investigation into Dispro-\nportionate Economic Hardship 3, 32, 37 (March 2011) \n(\u201c2011 DOE Study\u201d).3 DOE also recognized that small  \nrefineries\u2019 hardship would grow increasingly acute as  \nrenewable-fuel blending mandates increased. Id. at 17-18.  \nTo avoid damaging small refineries, Congress created \na permanent safety valve that allows a small refinery to \npetition EPA for an exemption from its annual RFS obli-\ngation \u201cfor the reason of disproportionate economic hard-\nship.\u201d \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(i). The Act provides that \u201c[a] small \nrefinery may at any time petition the Administrator\u201d for \n \n3  https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-12/docu-\nments/small-refinery-exempt-study.pdf. \n\n \n13 \nan exemption\u2014and thus requires each small refinery to \npetition separately for hardship relief. Ibid. (emphasis \nadded). Each granted petition frees only one small refin-\nery from its RFS obligation for the year(s) involved in the \npetition, based on that refinery\u2019s economic circumstances. \n\u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(i)-(ii); 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 80.1441(e)(2). EPA must \ndecide each small-refinery hardship petition in \u201cconsulta-\ntion\u201d with DOE after \u201cconsider[ing] the findings\u201d of DOE\u2019s \n2011 small-refinery study along with \u201cother economic fac-\ntors.\u201d \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(A)-(B). \nCongress required EPA to decide any hardship  \npetition submitted by a small refinery \u201cnot later than 90 \ndays after\u201d receipt, because a small refinery cannot plan \nadequately for RFS compliance until it knows whether it \nhas an obligation. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(iii). But EPA has failed \nto meet that deadline for almost 90 percent of hardship \npetitions submitted since 2013, causing significant uncer-\ntainty for small refineries. See U.S. Government Account-\nability Office, Renewable Fuel Standard: Actions Needed \nto Improve Decision-Making in the Small Refinery Ex-\nemption Program 20, GAO23104273 (Nov. 2022).4 \nc. When EPA has denied small-refinery hardship  \npetitions, the petitioners sometimes sought judicial review. \nRegarding venue for those challenges, EPA repeatedly \nacknowledged that RFS hardship-exemption decisions \nare \u201cquintessentially local action[s]\u201d that must be reviewed \nin the regional circuit courts. E.g., EPA Motion to Dismiss \n18, Advanced Biofuels Ass\u2019n v. EPA, No. 18-1115, Dkt. \n1740614 (D.C. Cir. July 13, 2018). \nOn the merits of those challenges, EPA suffered a \nstreak of losses where circuit courts vacated its hardship \ndecisions. See Sinclair Wyoming Refin. Co. v. EPA, 887 \n \n4  https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-23-104273. \n\n \n14 \nF.3d 986 (10th Cir. 2017); Ergon-West Virginia, Inc. v. \nEPA, 896 F.3d 600 (4th Cir. 2018); Renewable Fuels Ass\u2019n \nv. EPA, 948 F.3d 1206 (10th Cir. 2020); Ergon-West Vir-\nginia, Inc. v. EPA, 980 F.3d 403 (4th Cir. 2020). Frus-\ntrated by its repeated defeats in the regional circuits, and \nafter a 2021 change in presidential administration, EPA \nbegan attempting to eliminate small-refinery hardship  \nrelief altogether. EPA first abandoned defense of its own \nprior decisions granting hardship relief and began newly \ninsisting that a small refinery cannot receive relief unless \nit had received an exemption in every prior compliance \nyear. This Court rejected that new position in HollyFron-\ntier. 594 U.S. at 396-397. \nWhen that effort failed, EPA went back to the drawing \nboard intent on rejecting hardship relief and avoiding  \njudicial review anywhere other than the D.C. Circuit. \nB. The present controversy \n1. The small-refinery respondents here have repeat-\nedly received RFS hardship relief from EPA in the past, \nbecause each of them faces structural disadvantages that \nmake RFS compliance disproportionately burdensome. \nThe respondents petitioned EPA again for hardship relief \nfor some or all of the compliance years 2017 through 2021. \nPet.App.19a nn.26-27. EPA initially granted Wynne-\nwood\u2019s hardship petition for 2017, and it granted Calumet \nShreveport\u2019s, Ergon Refining\u2019s, Placid\u2019s, and Wynne-\nwood\u2019s petitions for 2018. See EPA, Decision on 2018 \nSmall Refinery Exemption Petitions (Aug. 9, 2019).5 \nIn December 2021, however, EPA reversed itself and \nissued a proposal to deny every pending small-refinery \nhardship petition, including by retroactively denying pre-\n \n5 https://www.regulations.gov/comment/EPA-HQ-OAR-2021-\n0566-0077#collapseAttachmentMetadata-ember186 (Tab I). \n\n \n15 \nviously granted petitions. 86 Fed. Reg. 70,999 (Dec. 14, \n2021). EPA proposed to do so by applying multiple sea-\nchanges to the agency\u2019s longstanding approach to hard-\nship petitions. See Proposed Denials.6 EPA also proposed, \nhowever, to continue its existing practice of deciding hard-\nship petitions through agency adjudication, because ap-\nplying a new rulemaking process to hardship petitions \nfrom prior years would have been unlawfully retroactive. \nSee Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hosp., 488 U.S. 204, 208-\n209 (1988). \nEPA\u2019s proposed denials included a new statutory in-\nterpretation and a new \u201ceconomic theory\u201d hypothesizing \nthat \u201cthe RFS program cannot cause [disproportionate \neconomic hardship]\u201d because RIN costs are supposedly \nthe same for all obligated parties regardless of their size, \nbargaining power, location, or blending capability, and  \nbecause obligated parties supposedly universally pass \nthrough 100% of their RIN costs in the price of the fuel \nthey sell. Proposed Denials 11-12 & n.37. Small refineries \ncommented on the proposal, explaining why EPA\u2019s new \nstatutory position was textually unsupportable and why \ntheir individual economic evidence refuted EPA\u2019s hypoth-\nesis that small refineries universally pass on RIN costs. \nE.g., JA 131-275. \nIn April 2022, in the first set of administrative actions \nchallenged here, EPA followed through on its proposal \nand simultaneously denied 36 previously decided hard-\nship petitions (31 of which EPA had previously granted), \nincluding petitions submitted by these respondents. \nPet.App.189a-330a (the \u201cApril Denials\u201d). EPA announced \nit was satisfied that each of the petitioning small refineries \n \n6  EPA, Proposed RFS Small Refinery Exemption Decision \n(Dec. \n2021), \nhttps://www.epa.gov/renewable-fuel-standard-\nprogram/proposal-deny-petitions-small-refinery-exemptions. \n\n \n16 \nwas able to fully pass through its RIN costs in the price of \nits fuel. Id. at 209a-212a. EPA issued each small refinery \na \u201cconfidential, refinery-specific appendi[x]\u201d to the April \nDenials\u2019 explanation document, giving individualized rea-\nsons for its conclusion that each refinery could pass \nthrough 100% of its RFS costs. Id. at 199a. \nIn June 2022, EPA largely copied and pasted its April \nreasoning to announce the denial of another 69 hardship \npetitions, including these small-refinery respondents\u2019  \npetitions for some or all of the 2017 and 2019-2021 years. \nPet.App.44a-188a (the \u201cJune Denials\u201d). The June Denials\u2019 \nexplanation document stated \u201cthat none of the 69 pending \n[small-refinery hardship] petitions for the 2016-2021 com-\npliance years ha[s] demonstrated [disproportionate eco-\nnomic hardship] caused by the cost of compliance with the \nrequirements of the RFS program.\u201d Pet.App.185a. EPA \nagain provided separate \u201cconfidential, refinery-specific \nappendices\u201d explaining its findings on each small refin-\nery\u2019s RIN-cost passthrough. Pet.App.55a. \nThe refinery-specific appendices accompanying the \nApril and June Denials detailed EPA\u2019s individualized  \nassessments of each small refinery\u2019s economic condition. \nFor example, EPA considered whether one respondent \nrefinery could blend enough biodiesel given that it oper-\nates in a market that does not accept biodiesel blends, and \nwhether that refinery faced higher ethanol costs than \nother large refiners and blenders in its area. JA 285-287. \nEPA considered whether another respondent faced \nhigher transportation costs for shipping from terminals \nalong the Gulf Coast. JA 293-295. And EPA considered \nthe price impacts to another respondent from the fact \nthat, in its tri-State region, the small refinery faced dimin-\nished demand for kerosene-based jet fuel and more- \nstringent specifications for ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel. JA \n\n \n17 \n312-313. It was based on individualized, refinery-specific  \nconsiderations like those\u2014how each refinery fits in its \nown local market\u2014that EPA concluded that each of the \npetitioning small refineries \u201cis recovering its [RFS com-\npliance] costs,\u201d and for that reason is not experiencing dis-\nproportionate economic hardship. E.g., JA 280, 286, 298. \nEPA accomplished its bundled denial decisions only \nby ignoring the statutory deadline to decide the hardship \npetitions; it held dozens beyond the 90-day deadline so \nthat it could deny them together and create the appear-\nance of promulgating just two actions. \n2. The small-refinery respondents filed petitions for \njudicial review of EPA\u2019s denials of their RFS hardship  \npetitions. Because the refineries each are headquartered, \nincorporated, or operate within the Fifth Circuit, they \nsought review there. Two groups representing the inter-\nests of the biofuel industry\u2014the respondents in support \nof petitioner here (\u201cBiofuel respondents\u201d)\u2014intervened to \nsupport EPA\u2019s denials of hardship relief. \nEPA moved to dismiss the petitions or transfer them \nto the D.C. Circuit, asserting that because it had bundled \ntogether its hardship-petition denial decisions, they were \n\u201cnationally applicable\u201d or else \u201cbased on a determination \nof nationwide scope or effect.\u201d \u00a7 7607(b)(1). \nThe Fifth Circuit denied EPA\u2019s motions. Pet.App.9a-\n15a. EPA\u2019s actions denying the small refineries\u2019 hardship \npetitions were \u201clocally \u2026 applicable,\u201d not \u201cnationally  \napplicable,\u201d because they affected only the individual  \npetitioning small refineries.

Circuit\u2014most without a substan-\ntive explanation or opinion. See U.S. Br. 13 & nn.2-3. \nIn July 2024, the D.C. Circuit unanimously agreed \nwith the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \u201canalysis and conclusion\u201d on the \nmerits that EPA\u2019s April and June Denials were \u201ccontrary \nto law\u201d and must be vacated. Sinclair Wyoming, 114 \nF.4th at 706-707 & n.5. The D.C. Circuit also held that the \ndenials were arbitrary and capricious because \u201creality  \nundercuts EPA\u2019s\u201d economic \u201ctheory\u201d that small refineries \ncan universally pass on their RIN costs. Id. at 713. \n \n\n \n19 \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nA. The Fifth Circuit correctly held that EPA\u2019s final \nactions challenged here were locally applicable rather \nthan nationally applicable, and were based on respond-\nents\u2019 local economic circumstances rather than any deter-\nmination of nationwide scope or effect.  \n1. Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s reference to the agency\u2019s \u201cfinal \naction \u2026 under this chapter\u201d indicates that it is the sub-\nstantive CAA text that determines what final actions the \nagency was authorized to take. Whether and how EPA \nchooses to bundle its final actions is irrelevant to venue. \nHere, every part of the relevant provision under the \n\u201cchapter\u201d\u2014especially the singular, definite articles and \nthe deadline for deciding hardship petitions indexed to \neach petition\u2019s submission date\u2014indicates that Congress \ndirected EPA to produce individualized final actions on  \nindividually submitted hardship petitions. \n2. EPA\u2019s individual denials of hardship relief were \nobviously locally appliable rather than nationally applica-\nble. The government does not argue otherwise. Those  \ndecisions on individually submitted petitions affecting \nonly one refinery look nothing like the enumerated nation-\nwide actions in Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s first sentence, but they \nclosely resemble the enumerated locally applicable ac-\ntions in the second sentence. \n3. \u201cDetermination\u201d is a term of art in the CAA. An \nEPA action is based on a determination of nationwide \nscope or effect in the rare instance where the CAA\u2019s text \ndirects EPA to make a \u201cdetermination\u201d about the entire \nnation or industry, without the need to consider individual \ncircumstances. But here, the CAA required EPA to base \nits hardship decisions on each petitioning small refinery\u2019s \nindividual economic hardship factors. And EPA\u2019s own doc-\numents confirm that the agency did just that. \n\n \n20 \nB. The government\u2019s arguments seeking D.C. Circuit \nreview fail. \n1. The government goes astray because it gets the \nrelevant \u201caction\u201d wrong. EPA contends that its denials of \n105 individually submitted hardship petitions were really \njust two actions, asserting that a court may not contest \nEPA\u2019s \u201ccharacterization\u201d of its actions. But it is the text \nof \u201cth[e] chapter,\u201d not EPA, that determines what final \nactions the agency is authorized to take.  \n2. EPA\u2019s argument for national applicability depends \non the Court accepting the agency\u2019s view of the relevant \nunit of administrative action. Even if EPA were correct \nthat the bundled decision announcements were the rele-\nvant actions, those still were not nationally applicable  \nbecause they applied only to those refineries that chose to \npetition for hardship relief, not to the whole nation. EPA \nasserts that any agency action that touches more than one \njudicial circuit is nationally applicable. But that argument \nproduces the absurd result that an expressly regional  \naction for a metropolitan region that happens to encom-\npass two States (and two circuits) would be \u201cnationally ap-\nplicable\u201d and reviewable only by the D.C. Circuit. \n3. Contrary to EPA\u2019s assertion, the hardship denial \nactions were not based on any determination of nation-\nwide scope or effect. \nThe relevant text of the \u201cchapter\u201d here, unlike other \nclosely related provisions, does not call for any \u201cdetermi-\nnation\u201d on a small-refinery hardship petition. EPA\u2019s argu-\nment depends on treating \u201cdetermination\u201d not as a term \nof art but as an amorphous concept of anything that con-\ntributed significantly to an EPA action. \nIn any event, neither EPA\u2019s new interpretation of the \nAct, nor its new RIN-cost-passthrough economic hypoth-\nesis, were \u201cnationwide determinations\u201d that formed the \n\n \n21 \n\u201cbas[is]\u201d for EPA\u2019s hardship denial decisions. Every EPA \naction necessarily rests to some degree on the agency\u2019s \nunderstanding of its statutory authority. And EPA is  \nrequired to apply a \u201cuniform\u201d statutory interpretation to \nsimilarly situated small-refinery petitioners\u2014anything \nelse would have been arbitrary. Moreover, EPA\u2019s new \nstatutory reading could not be the basis for final actions \non respondents\u2019 hardship petitions; EPA expressly did \nnot use a rulemaking here. EPA achieved final actions \nonly by applying its statutory interpretation to respond-\nents\u2019 individual economic facts. \nFor the same reason, even if EPA\u2019s economic theory \ncould qualify as a \u201cdetermination\u201d under the CAA, the  \nfinal actions denying respondents\u2019 hardship petitions \nwere not \u201cbased on\u201d it. Moving beyond hypothesis to final \nactions required EPA to test its prediction against re-\nspondents\u2019 economic evidence. And EPA acknowledges on \nthe face of the denial decisions that it did so. \nEPA\u2019s decisions here do not resemble the unusual \nCAA provision that was the genesis for the nationwide-\ndetermination exception sentence in Section 7607(b)(1).  \nEPA\u2019s appeals to policy cannot overcome the statutory \ntext. And in any event, EPA\u2019s attempt to force dozens of \nsmall refineries to litigate their RFS hardship-denial  \ndecisions together in the D.C. Circuit has served only to  \nobscure judicial consideration of the individual economic \nfactors that the CAA makes the core basis for hardship \nrelief. \n \n \n\n \n22 \nARGUMENT \nSection 7607(b)(1) sets the venue for a petition for  \nreview principally by asking whether the EPA \u201cfinal  \naction\u201d being challenged is nationally applicable or  \nlocally/regionally applicable. Courts identify the relevant \n\u201cfinal action\u201d by examining the substantive text of \u201cth[e] \nchapter\u201d\u2014the CAA. Here the chapter designates the final \nactions as EPA\u2019s denials of small refineries\u2019 individually \nsubmitted RFS hardship petitions. The statutory text \ncalls for individualized consideration of each petitioning \nsmall refinery\u2019s \u201cdisproportionate economic hardship.\u201d \n\u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B). \nOnce EPA\u2019s individual denial decisions are properly \nidentified as the \u201cfinal action[s]\u201d under challenge, their \nnational vs. local applicability is obvious: Those individual \ndenials are, as EPA has always said, \u201cquintessentially  \nlocal action[s]\u201d for Section 7607(b)(1) because they \u201cadju-\ndicate[ ] legal rights as to a single refinery in a single loca-\ntion.\u201d EPA Motion 18, Advanced Biofuels, No. 18-1115, \nsupra. The face of the actions here confirms that EPA \nreached final decisions only by examining refinery-specific \nevidence and reaching refinery-specific conclusions that \nnone of these respondents experiences disproportionate \neconomic hardship from the RFS. Indeed, the statutory \ntext compelled EPA to deny hardship relief based on the \npetitioning small refineries\u2019 own economic circum-\nstances\u2014not any nationwide determination. So the Fifth \nCircuit correctly held that it was the proper venue rather \nthan the D.C. Circuit. \nThe government contends (U.S. Br. 28-29) that these \nhardship-petition denial actions are nationally applica-\nble\u2014unlike all prior hardship decisions\u2014because EPA \nhas \u201ccharacteriz[ed]\u201d them differently. EPA conceives of \nits decisions denying 105 separately submitted hardship \n\n \n23 \npetitions as just two national actions because it chose to \nannounce those denials together. But EPA does not  \ndecide what the relevant \u201cfinal action\u201d is under the CAA\u2014\nthe statute does. The substantive CAA provision at issue \ndesignates each individual hardship decision as the rele-\nvant unit of administrative action, none of which applies in \nmore than one circuit. EPA\u2019s suggestions that any action \nhappening to touch more than one circuit is \u201cnationally  \napplicable,\u201d and that it can manufacture nationally appli-\ncable actions by bundling individual decisions together, \nare inconsistent with the CAA\u2019s text, context, and history, \nas well as common sense. \nAlternatively, EPA claims that these hardship deci-\nsions are locally applicable but based on a new statutory \ninterpretation and economic theory that have nationwide \nscope or effect. Wrong, both times. EPA\u2019s musings about \nits statutory instructions, and its generalized economic \nhypothesis about small refineries\u2019 RIN costs, were merely \nsteps along the way of EPA\u2019s individual-refinery deci-\nsionmaking process. Neither was a \u201cdetermination\u201d\u2014 \na term of art in the CAA\u2014called for by the text. And nei-\nther produced any final agency action. EPA\u2019s final actions \nwere instead expressly based on its conclusions about \neach petitioning small refinery\u2019s economic circumstances. \nEPA itself says it denied respondents\u2019 hardship petitions \nbased on its (erroneous) view that each refinery \u201cis recov-\nering its [RFS compliance] costs.\u201d E.g., JA 280, 286, 298 \n(emphasis added). \nUnder the venue instructions in Section 7607(b)(1),  \nreview of these hardship-petition actions belongs in the \nregional circuit courts\u2014exactly where prior actions on \nsimilar petitions have long been reviewed. The Fifth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s judgment should be affirmed. \n\n \n24 \nA. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision was correct. \nIdentifying the proper venue for judicial review under \nSection 7607(b)(1) involves three questions: (1) What  \n\u201cfinal action\u201d did EPA take \u201cunder\u201d the CAA? (2) Was \nthat final action locally or regionally applicable, as opposed \nto nationally applicable? (3) If so, was the action neverthe-\nless \u201cbased on a determination of nationwide scope or  \neffect\u201d? The Fifth Circuit answered each of those ques-\ntions correctly. \n1. The \u201cfinal action[s]\u201d are EPA\u2019s denials of each \nsmall-refinery\u2019s hardship petition. \na. The parties and the courts of appeals agree that \n\u201cSection 7607(b)(1) categorizes petitions for [judicial]  \nreview according to the nature of the [EPA] action\u201d being \nchallenged. Texas 2016, 829 F.3d at 419; accord U.S. Br. \n20 (citing additional cases). But a court cannot assess an  \naction\u2019s nature until it identifies \u201cwhat \u2018final action\u2019 [it is] \ndealing with.\u201d Kentucky v. EPA, Nos. 23-3216/23-3225, \n2023 WL 11871967, at *2 (6th Cir. July 25, 2023).  \nThe statute helpfully describes how to answer that \nquestion: refer to the \u201cfinal action of [EPA] under this \nchapter.\u201d \u00a7 7607(b)(1) (emphasis added). \u201c[T]his chapter\u201d \nis the CAA. See p. 6, supra. Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s phrase  \n\u201cfinal action \u2026 under this chapter\u201d points the reader to \nthe substantive CAA provision that provides \u201cthe legal \nsource of the agency\u2019s \u2026 authority to take the challenged \nactions.\u201d Texas 2023, 2023 WL 7204840, at *4; see p. 10, \nsupra (additional cases making the same point). \nSection 7607(b)(1)\u2019s overall structure makes this even \nmore clear. By enumerating specific CAA sections author-\nizing national or local/regional actions in the first two sen-\ntences, and then adding a catchall clause to each sentence \nfor \u201cany other\u201d nationally or locally/regionally applicable \naction, the venue provision repeatedly requires cross ref-\n\n \n25 \nerencing the CAA provision that authorized the EPA  \naction under challenge. See Kentucky, 123 F.4th at 461 \n(Section 7607(b)(1) \u201cfocuses on the statute \u2026 to distin-\nguish\u201d national vs. local/regional actions). \nb. The \u201cfinal action\u201d that the CAA authorized here is \nfor EPA to \u201cact on\u201d a small refinery\u2019s individually submit-\nted RFS hardship petition. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B); see Pet.App. \n185a (EPA invoking \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B) as its source of author-\nity). So that is the \u201crelevant unit of administrative action\u201d \nfor venue purposes. Texas 2023, 2023 WL 7204840, at *4.  \nEverything about that substantive text demonstrates \nthat EPA\u2019s final actions on hardship petitions are to be \nindividualized. Every reference in that subsection to the \n\u201cpetition\u201d or the petitioning \u201crefinery\u201d is in the singular: \n\u201cA small refinery may at any time petition\u201d EPA for a \nhardship exemption, based on the \u201creason of dispropor-\ntionate economic hardship\u201d if required to comply with the \nRFS. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(i) (emphasis added). EPA must \n\u201cevaluat[e] a petition,\u201d considering the findings of the \n2011 DOE small-refinery study and other economic fac-\ntors. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(ii) (emphasis added). Whether a par-\nticular petitioning small refinery is experiencing dis-\nproportionate economic hardship from the RFS in a given \nyear is necessarily an individualized inquiry focused on \nthat refinery\u2019s own economic circumstances.  \nCongress also provided that the statutory deadline for \nEPA to \u201cact on any [small-refinery hardship] petition\u201d is \nindexed to each petition: \u201cnot later than 90 days after the \ndate of receipt of the petition.\u201d \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(iii). That \nprovision forcefully confirms that Congress directed EPA \nto produce individualized actions on hardship petitions; \nthe rolling, refinery-specific deadlines would make no \nsense otherwise. Cf. Kentucky, 123 F.4th at 461 (EPA\u2019s \nobligation \u201cto \u2018act\u2019 on each State\u2019s \u2018submission\u2019 on a plan-\n\n \n26 \nby-plan basis within a specified time\u201d indicates those  \nactions are locally rather than nationally applicable) (cita-\ntion omitted). And as mentioned above (p. 17, supra), EPA \nwas able to produce bundled hardship decisions only by \ndeliberately ignoring the CAA\u2019s decision deadline. \nThe broader statutory context also shows that Con-\ngress did not intend its \u201csingular\u201d definite and indefinite \narticles in this subsection to \u201cinclude and apply to several \npersons, parties, or things.\u201d Contra U.S. Br. 26 (quoting \n1 U.S.C. \u00a7 1). Congress initially granted a blanket exemp-\ntion from the RFS through 2011 to all \u201csmall refineries\u201d\u2014\nplural. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(A)(i). Congress then directed EPA to \nextend that exemption for another two years on an indi-\nvidualized basis to only \u201ca\u201d small refinery that DOE  \ndetermined would face disproportionate economic hard-\nship from the RFS. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(A)(ii)(II). After that, Con-\ngress transitioned to the current petition-based approach. \n\u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B). The statute now puts the onus on each \nsmall refinery to request hardship relief based on its own \n\u201cdisproportionate economic hardship.\u201d \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(i). \nCongress knew how to authorize blanket or multiple  \nexemption actions, but it did not do so here. Congress  \ninstead directed EPA to \u201cact on\u201d \u201cthe petition\u201d \u201csubmit-\nted by a small refinery.\u201d \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(iii) (emphases \nadded). \nc. Federal courts\u2019 practice also reflects the reality \nthat EPA\u2019s individual hardship-exemption decisions are \nthe final actions for venue purposes. When the Fifth Cir-\ncuit below held that EPA\u2019s denial decisions were unlawful, \nit did not vacate all 105 EPA denial decisions, despite the \ngovernment\u2019s urging that it had produced just two na-\ntional actions. Instead, the Fifth Circuit properly vacated \nonly the denial decisions for the small refineries before it. \nPet.App.34a. \n\n \n27 \nIn another recent case involving subsequent small- \nrefinery hardship decisions that EPA bundled together, \nthe government moved the D.C. Circuit to act separately \non the denial decisions for particular refineries\u2014to vacate \nsome final actions in EPA\u2019s bundle but not others. See \nCalumet Montana Refin., LLC v. EPA, No. 23-1194, Dkt. \n2081226 (Oct. 21, 2024); see id., Dkt. 2091139 (Dec. 23, \n2024) (D.C. Circuit granting limited vacatur in accord with \nEPA\u2019s request). That motion confirms EPA\u2019s agreement \nthat, even when it bundles small-refinery hardship deci-\nsions together, courts review the individual final actions \nthat apply to each refinery. And EPA would surely take \nthe position that each denied refinery must file a petition \nfor review to obtain judicial review at all. \n* \nThe relevant \u201cfinal action[s]\u201d for venue purposes are \nthus EPA\u2019s decisions on each small refinery\u2019s hardship \npetition, regardless of EPA\u2019s choice to bundle its petition  \ndecisions. Accord Kentucky, 123 F.4th at 460-463 (reject-\ning EPA\u2019s argument that its consolidated disapprovals of \n21 state implementation plans constituted a single action). \nOnce the action is properly identified, it \u201cmakes this case \neasy.\u201d Id. at 461. EPA\u2019s individual denial decisions are  \nobviously locally/regionally applicable\u2014the government \ndoesn\u2019t try to argue otherwise. And those decisions did \nnot involve any nationwide \u201cdetermination\u201d called for by \nthe CAA. Rather, each was based (as they must be per the \nAct) on EPA\u2019s refinery-specific evaluations of each peti-\ntioning small refinery\u2019s own economic hardship factors\u2014\nthings like local-market acceptance of renewable fuel, \npercentage of diesel production, access to capital, etc. See, \ne.g., JA 280, 285-287, 293-298. \n\n \n28 \n2. EPA\u2019s denials of the hardship petitions are \u201clocally \nor regionally applicable\u201d actions. \na. The venue provision\u2019s \u201capplicability\u201d inquiry\u2014 \nnationally vs. locally/regionally applicable\u2014asks about \n\u201cthe location of the persons or enterprises that the action \nregulates.\u201d Texas v. EPA, No. 10-60961, 2011 WL 710598, \nat *3 (5th Cir. Feb. 24, 2011) (quoting New York v. EPA, \n133 F.3d 987, 990 (7th Cir. 1998)). Multiple courts of  \nappeals have agreed, at the government\u2019s urging, that \nwhat matters is \u201cthe face of \u201d the action, American Road, \n705 F.3d at 456 (Kavanaugh, J.), not the action\u2019s reasoning \nor practical \u201ceffects,\u201d ATK Launch, 651 F.3d at 1197.  \nAccord U.S. Br. 20-21 (citing additional cases).7 \nThe \u201c \u2018ordinary meaning\u2019 \u201d of the \u201ckey words\u201d in Sec-\ntion 7607(b)(1)\u2019s first sentence\u2014\u201c \u2018nationally applicable \nregulations promulgated, or final action taken\u2019 by the \nEPA\u201d\u2014\u201cconvey[s] that the challenged regulations or  \naction must apply to the entire country.\u201d Kentucky, 123 \nF.4th at 459 (emphasis added; citations omitted).

And the \nfirst sentence\u2019s enumerated CAA actions all \u201chave nation-\nwide applicability,\u201d ibid.: They regulate across the whole \nnation without individualized consideration, and they  \napply irrespective of whether any party requested agency \naction or not. By contrast, the enumerated locally applica-\nble actions in Section 7607(b)(1) involve individual regu-\nlated entities or States. Finding a \u201cnationally applicable\u201d \naction for purposes of the catchall clause thus requires \nidentifying an EPA final action that similarly affects the \nentire nation, irrespective of a party\u2019s local circumstances. \nSecond, \u201ccourts presume that Congress means to \nadopt \u2018clear boundaries\u2019 in \u2018jurisdictional statutes\u2019 to avoid \nwasteful litigation over the proper forum.\u201d Kentucky, 123 \nF.4th at 460 (quoting Direct Mktg. Ass\u2019n v. Brohl, 575 \nU.S. 1, 11 (2015), and citing other cases). The courts of  \nappeals have agreed that Section 7607(b)(1) is a venue \nprovision rather than a jurisdictional one.8 But the basic \npoint is the same: No one\u2019s interests are served by com-\nplex disputes over venue. Clear boundaries are set by giv-\ning \u201cnationally applicable\u201d its ordinary meaning: An EPA \nfinal action is \u201cnationally applicable\u201d for purposes of  \nSection 7607(b)(1) when it governs the entire nation, as  \nopposed to when it governs some lesser subset of regu-\nlated parties, States, or regions. \nb. In the context of the RFS program, the CAA  \nauthorizes EPA to take some national actions and some \nlocal actions. For example: When EPA publishes annual \n \n8  See Texas 2016, 829 F.3d at 418; Dalton Trucking, Inc. v. \nEPA, 808 F.3d 875, 879 (D.C. Cir. 2015); Clean Water Action \nCouncil of Ne. Wis., Inc. v. EPA, 765 F.3d 749, 751 (7th Cir. \n2014). \n\n \n30 \nrenewable-fuel blending-volume obligations for the indus-\ntry, that is a nationally applicable action, and any chal-\nlenge to it goes to the D.C. Circuit. See, e.g., Americans \nfor Clean Energy v. EPA, 864 F.3d 691 (D.C. Cir. 2017). \nThat\u2019s because EPA\u2019s volumes rule affects every RFS-\nobligated party in the nation.  \nBut when EPA decides a small refinery\u2019s RFS hard-\nship petition, that is a \u201cquintessentially local action,\u201d as \nEPA itself has previously (correctly) put it. EPA Motion \n18, Advanced Biofuels, No. 18-1115, supra. Hardship  \ndecisions look nothing like the national actions enumer-\nated in Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s first sentence, but they closely \nresemble the individualized decisions enumerated in the \nsecond sentence. Hardship decisions do not regulate the \nwhole nation or industry; they \u201cinvolve only the regulation \nof \u201d individual facilities\u2019 requests for relief and \u201chave legal \nconsequences only for [those] facilities.\u201d Texas 2023, 2023 \nWL 7204840, at *5; see West Virginia Chamber of Com-\nmerce v. Browner, 166 F.3d 336 (4th Cir. 1998) (finding it \n\u201cclearly regionally applicable\u201d \u201cwhen the EPA \u2026 makes \na determination with respect to a particular facility\u201d). \nAs EPA has previously explained: Each of the small-\nrefinery respondents\u2019 hardship petitions \u201conly requested \nrelief for one refinery.\u201d EPA Reply in Support of Motion \nto Dismiss 2, Lion Oil Co. v. EPA, No. 14-3405, Dkt. \n4227218 (8th Cir. Dec. 17, 2014). And each denial action \nwas a \u201cdecision with respect to a particular small refin-\nery\u2019s request\u201d that \u201cadjudicates legal rights as to that sin-\ngle refinery in its single location.\u201d U.S. Br. 15, Producers \nof Renewables United for Integrity Truth and Transpar-\nency v. EPA (\u201cPRUITT\u201d), No. 18-1202, Dkt. 1775897 \n(D.C. Cir. Mar. 4, 2019). \nThat is why EPA has repeatedly argued that RFS \nhardship decisions are locally applicable for Section \n\n \n31 \n7607(b)(1), before EPA began attempting to manufacture \nvenue in the D.C. Circuit by bundling decisions together. \nE.g., PRUITT, No. 18-1202, supra; EPA Response 2,  \nRenewable Fuels Ass\u2019n v. EPA, No. 18-9533, Dkt. 35 (10th \nCir. July 12, 2018) (\u201cvenue is proper in this Court\u201d); U.S. \nBr. 2-3, Ergon-West Virginia, Inc. v. EPA, Nos. 19-2128, \n19-2148, 19-2152 (consol.), Dkt. 64 (4th Cir. May 28, 2020) \n(challenge to denied hardship petition \u201cproperly venued\u201d \nin Fourth Circuit \u201cbecause the action is locally or region-\nally applicable\u201d). \n3. EPA\u2019s actions were based on local economic facts, \nnot any nationwide statutory determination. \na. Because EPA\u2019s denials of respondents\u2019 RFS hard-\nship petitions are \u201clocally or regionally applicable ac-\ntion[s],\u201d the text of Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s third sentence \npresumptively \u201crequires review in th[e] [regional] cir-\ncuit.\u201d Texas 2016, 829 F.3d at 424; see Kentucky, 2023 WL \n11871967, at *3. EPA can overcome that presumption only \nby demonstrating that its denials were \u201cbased on a deter-\nmination of nationwide scope or effect.\u201d \u00a7 7607(b)(1); see \npp. 8-10, supra. \nThe courts of appeals broadly agree that the scope and \neffect of EPA\u2019s determinations are reviewed \u201cde novo\u201d \nand without deference to the agency. Texas 2016, 829 F.3d \nat 421 (5th Cir.); see Sierra Club, 47 F.4th at 746 (D.C. \nCir.); Dalton Trucking, Inc. v. EPA, 808 F.3d 875, 881 \n(D.C. Cir. 2015). The third-sentence exception applies \nonly \u201cif [the] action is based on a determination of nation-\nwide scope or effect and if in taking such action the Ad-\nministrator finds and publishes that such action is based \non such a determination.\u201d \u00a7 7607(b)(1) (emphases added). \nIt does not suffice for EPA to find and publish a nation-\nwide-effect conclusion; the action must actually be based \non a determination of nationwide scope or effect and EPA \n\n \n32 \nmust publish that finding. The first of those independent \n\u201ctwo conditions\u201d (unlike the second) makes no reference \nto what EPA finds or publishes, so it is a legal question for \nthe courts. Texas 2016, 829 F.3d at 421; see Sierra Club, \n47 F.4th at 746; see also Loper Bright Enterprises v. Rai-\nmondo, 603 U.S. 369 (2024). \nBoth the text and history of Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s third \nsentence show that, to trigger the exception, the relevant \nsubstantive CAA provision must textually direct EPA to \nmake a \u201cdetermination\u201d for the entire nation\u2014i.e., the \nkind of determination that does not depend on individual \ncircumstances. See pp. 8-9, supra. That was the kind of \nstatutory determination identified by EPA General Coun-\nsel Frick that the government agrees (U.S. Br. 18) \nprompted Congress to add the third sentence to Section \n7607(b)(1). And the government further agrees (U.S. Br. \n31) that Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s \u201cbased on\u201d formulation means \nthe relevant EPA determination cannot be \u201cperipheral or \nextraneous\u201d but must \u201clie at the core of the agency  \naction.\u201d Texas 2016, 829 F.3d at 419. \nThe CAA is littered with provisions requiring \u201cdeter-\nminations\u201d as the basis for final actions. In fact, more than \nhalf of the CAA\u2019s sections call for at least one determina-\ntion before EPA can act. See generally 42 U.S.C. Ch. 85. \nCongress\u2019s repeated use of the term \u201cdetermination\u201d or \nits derivatives throughout the Act indicates it is a term of \nart with the same meaning in Section 7607(b)(1). See  \nMohamad v. Palestinian Auth., 566 U.S. 449, 456 (2012). \nSo courts do not apply Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s third sentence \nby asking generally about the inputs or processes for an \nEPA action; they look to whether the statutory text called \nfor taking that action on the basis of a specific kind of  \ndetermination. See Kentucky, 123 F.4th at 463-464 (\u201cWhen \nused to describe a ruling from an \u2018administrative agency,\u2019 \n\n \n33 \n\u2018determination\u2019 has a more precise \u2018legal meaning\u2019 \u201d that \ndoes \u201cnot\u201d refer to \u201ceach preliminary step on the road to \n[the agency\u2019s] decision.\u201d) (citation omitted). \nb. EPA\u2019s denials of the small-refinery respondents\u2019 \nhardship petitions were not based on any statutory deter-\nminations of nationwide scope or effect.  \ni. That is so, first, because the relevant CAA provi-\nsion here (\u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)) does not call for any determi-\nnation at all. Unlike the immediately preceding subsection \nand other subsections within the same section, subsection \n7545(o)(9)(B) does not use the phrase \u201cdetermination\u201d or \n\u201cdetermines.\u201d It instead invites a small refinery to peti-\ntion for relief \u201cfor the reason of disproportionate economic \nhardship,\u201d and it says that EPA should \u201cevaluat[e]\u201d that \nhardship petition in consultation with DOE after consid-\nering DOE\u2019s 2011 study and \u201cother economic factors.\u201d \nThere are no statutory \u201cdetermination[s]\u201d in that process. \nTo the extent Section 7545(o)(9)(B) contemplates any \nstatutory determination at all, it calls for a determination \nthat has a local scope and effect. After the blanket RFS \nexemption for small refineries ended in 2011, Congress  \ndirected EPA to extend an exemption for at least two \nmore years \u201c[i]n the case of a small refinery that the Sec-\nretary of Energy determines \u2026 would be subject to a dis-\nproportionate economic hardship if required to comply \nwith\u201d the RFS. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(A)(ii)(II) (emphases added). \nNo longer did all small refineries nationwide get the  \nexemption; only those specific small refineries that were  \ndetermined to face disproportionate economic hardship. \nThat provision required EPA to grant exemptions based \non DOE\u2019s local determination that a particular small  \nrefinery would face hardship. \n \n\n \n34 \nCongress then provided in the very next subsection\u2014\nthe one at issue here\u2014that \u201c[a] small refinery may at any \ntime petition [EPA] for an extension of the exemption  \nunder subparagraph (A) for the reason of disproportion-\nate economic hardship.\u201d \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(i). The reference \nback to \u201csubparagraph (A)\u201d indicates that, when EPA \nconsiders a small refinery\u2019s hardship petition, it must \nmake the same individualized hardship determinations \nthat drove the earlier regime. \nThe plain text of \u201cth[e] chapter\u201d thus compels EPA\u2019s \nhardship decisions to be \u201cbased on\u201d an economic analysis \nfor \u201ca\u201d petitioning small refinery that is local in scope and \neffect. \u00a7 7607(b)(1); \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(i). EPA has said the \nsame thing: the Act \u201cgive[s] EPA the authority to grant \n[a hardship] petition only when a small refinery demon-\nstrates it is experiencing [hardship] caused by compliance \nwith the RFS program.\u201d Pet.App.185a. That must be the \ncore basis for any final action on a hardship petition. \nii. Moreover, the record here shows that EPA in fact \nbased its final actions denying hardship relief on just such \nindividualized conclusions. EPA explained that it had \n\u201ccompleted a thorough evaluation of the data and infor-\nmation provided in the [hardship] petitions, supplemental \nsubmissions, and comments to determine if any of the  \npetitioners have demonstrated that the cost of compliance \nwith the RFS is the cause of their alleged [hardship].\u201d \nPet.App.94a-95a. EPA then found \u201cthat none of the\u201d \npending petitions had \u201cdemonstrated [hardship] caused \nby the cost of compliance with the requirements of the \nRFS program.\u201d Pet.App.185a; accord U.S. Br. 10 (\u201cEPA  \ndetermined that none of the petitioning small refineries \nhad rebutted [the RIN-cost-passthrough] presumption \nthrough evidence about their specific circumstances.\u201d). \n\n \n35 \nTo be sure, EPA had hypothesized in the proposed  \ndenials, before its final actions, that no small refinery \nwould suffer hardship from the RFS because each could \nfully pass through its RIN costs. But that was merely a \nhypothesis. EPA called it then an \u201ceconomic theory,\u201d \nPet.App.212a n.42, 251a; and calls it now (U.S. Br. 8) a \u201cre-\nbuttable presumption.\u201d Whatever it\u2019s called, for EPA to \ntest its hypothesis\u2014to move beyond theory and produce \nfinal agency action on the hardship petitions\u2014EPA con-\ncedes that it needed to, and did, \u201ccarefully review[ ] data, \n[fuel-sales] contracts, and other information from small \nrefineries.\u201d Pet.App.98a-99a. It was only then that EPA \nconcluded (erroneously) that each small refinery actually \n\u201cis recovering its [RFS compliance] costs,\u201d e.g., JA 280, \n286, 298, and for that reason does not face economic hard-\nship, Pet.App.100a. \n* \nBoth the statutory text and record confirm that EPA \ntook these final actions \u201cbased on\u201d conclusions that none \nof the small-refinery respondents would experience  \ndisproportionate economic hardship from the RFS. \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1). Even if those conclusions could qualify as \n\u201cdeterminations\u201d at all, they were local determinations \nbased on an analysis of each refinery\u2019s local evidence, not \nany \u201cdetermination of nationwide scope or effect.\u201d Ibid. \nB. EPA\u2019s arguments seeking D.C. Circuit review fail. \nDespite EPA\u2019s longtime position that its final actions \non hardship petitions are reviewable only in the regional \ncircuit courts, EPA now argues that these denial decisions \nwere nationally applicable, or else were based on a deter-\nmination of nationwide scope or effect. EPA is wrong on \nboth points. \n\n \n36 \n1. EPA gets the \u201caction\u201d wrong. \nEPA does not attempt to argue that its individual \nhardship-petition decisions\u2014as opposed to its bundled  \nexplanations in the April and June Denials of its reasons \nfor denying those petitions\u2014were nationally applicable. \nEPA\u2019s argument thus hangs on this Court being willing to \ncredit its assertion that it produced just two final actions. \nBut the statute shows EPA is wrong about that. It is the \nchapter\u2019s text, not EPA, that establishes what qualifies as \nthe relevant \u201caction\u201d \u201cunder\u201d the CAA. Texas 2023, 2023 \nWL 7204840, at *4. \na. EPA\u2019s brief offers no real attempt to analyze the \nfirst critical phrase in Section 7607(b)(1): \u201cfinal action \u2026 \nunder this chapter.\u201d The government says (U.S. Br. 28-\n29) all that matters is \u201cEPA\u2019s characterization of its own \nagency action\u201d and that courts may not \u201csecond-guess \nEPA\u2019s own framing.\u201d But all agree it is the nature of the \nadministrative action that matters for venue. See pp. 22-\n23, supra. And nothing in the statute gives EPA the power \nto alter the nature of administrative actions just by choos-\ning how to publish those actions (grouped together vs.  \nindividual announcements). EPA\u2019s argument calls back to \nan era before this Court held squarely that \u201ccourts, not \nagencies,\u201d determine \u201cthe meaning of statutory provi-\nsions.\u201d Loper Bright, 603 U.S. at 392, 394. \nThe Sixth Circuit recently explained why it rejected \nthe same argument advanced by the government here: \nthat EPA\u2019s choice of framing, rather than the statutory \ntext, controls what counts as the final action. See Ken-\ntucky, 123 F.4th at 460-463. \u201cThe \u2018structure\u2019 of the judicial-\nreview provision \u2026 focuses on the statute\u201d\u2014not on how \nEPA chose to report its decisions\u2014\u201cto distinguish the \nEPA actions that parties must challenge in the D.C. Cir-\ncuit from those they must challenge in regional circuits.\u201d \n\n \n37 \nId. at 461 (quoting Engine Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. South Coast Air \nQuality Mgmt. Dist., 541 U.S. 246, 252 (2004)). Congress\u2019s \nown designation in Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s first two sen-\ntences of enumerated actions as either nationally applica-\nble or locally applicable, combined with catchall phrases \nfor each sentence, indicates it is the Act, not EPA, that \ngives an action its nature. See ibid. \nEPA\u2019s invocation (U.S. Br. 28) of \u201cthe face of the final \naction\u201d does not advance the analysis. \u201cTh[at] argument \nconflates the [explanation] issued\u201d for EPA\u2019s hardship-\ndenial decisions \u201cwith the \u2018final action\u2019 that the EPA \ntakes.\u201d Kentucky, 123 F.4th at 462 (quoting \u00a7 7607(b)(1)). \nSmall-refinery respondents\u2019 position does not depend on \nthe contents of any petitioner\u2019s court challenge to the \nEPA action or on downstream effects. Venue depends,  \ninstead, on whether the text of the chapter shows the chal-\nlenged action on its face to be more like Section \n7607(b)(1)\u2019s enumerated nationally applicable actions \n(governing the whole nation) or more like the enumerated \nlocally applicable actions that resolve individual parties\u2019 \nrights or obligations. \nb. None of that calls into question EPA\u2019s \u201cfree[dom] \nto fashion [its] own rules of procedure,\u201d including \n\u201c \u2018whether applications should be heard contemporane-\nously or successively.\u2019 \u201d U.S. Br. 26-27 (quoting FCC v. \nPottsville Broad. Co., 309 U.S. 134, 138 (1940)). That free-\ndom includes the \u201cprocess\u201d for taking action; for example, \nthe freedom (where the law permits) to choose between \n\u201crulemaking, individual adjudication, or a combination of \nthe two.\u201d NAACP v. Federal Power Comm\u2019n, 425 U.S. \n662, 668 (1976). EPA could have conducted a rulemaking \nto establish a new interpretation of Section 7545(o)(9)(B) \nand new adjudicatory framework, and such a rule would \nlikely have been nationally applicable. But a new rule like \n\n \n38 \nthat would have needed to be prospective only, see p. 15, \nsupra, which did not meet EPA\u2019s goal here to issue long-\noverdue decisions denying previously submitted small- \nrefinery hardship petitions from prior years.  \nRespondents\u2019 position thus does not disturb EPA\u2019s \nchoice whether to proceed by rulemaking versus adjudi-\ncation. EPA will retain flexibility in running its future \nhardship decisionmaking processes, so long as it examines \neach small refinery\u2019s evidence and adheres to the statu-\ntory decision deadline for final action on each petition. \nWhat EPA may not do is what it attempted here: disre-\ngard whether the CAA\u2019s text calls for local rather than \nnational action. Contrary to EPA\u2019s assertion (U.S. Br. \n26-27), respondents\u2019 textual analysis does not rely merely \non \u201can indefinite article.\u201d As described above (pp. 24-27,  \nsupra), every relevant part of the text and structure of \nSection 7545(o)(9) confirms that Congress wanted RFS \nhardship decisions to be individualized. Cf. Kentucky, 123 \nF.4th at 461 (\u201cthe disapproval of each state plan qualifies \nas a distinct \u2018action\u2019 \u201d). \n2. EPA fails to establish that the hardship decisions \nare nationally applicable. \nWith EPA\u2019s misidentification of the relevant final  \naction corrected, the errors in its remaining arguments \nbecome clear. EPA\u2019s April and June 2022 explanation doc-\numents asserted that the agency had taken nationally  \napplicable actions for two reasons. First, EPA announced \ntogether the denial of hardship petitions submitted by  \nrefineries located in different circuits. Pet.App.185a-188a \n(June 2022 announcement: \u201cThis final action denies 69  \npetitions \u2026 for over 30 small refineries across the coun-\ntry[.]\u201d); Pet.App.327a-330a (similar for April 2022 an-\nnouncement). Second, EPA applied its new statutory \ninterpretation and new economic passthrough hypothesis \n\n \n39 \nto all hardship petitions that the agency adjudicated. E.g., \nPet.App.187a-188a (\u201cEPA\u2019s revised interpretation of the \nrelevant CAA provisions and the RIN discount and RIN \ncost passthrough principles \u2026 are applicable to all small \nrefineries.\u201d). \na. Although EPA defended the second venue argu-\nment in its certiorari petition, U.S. Pet. 10 (arguing that \nthe Denials \u201care \u2018nationally applicable\u2019 because they apply \na uniform methodology to small refineries\u201d), it has now \nabandoned it, making only the geographic argument here. \nU.S. Br. 19-24. Rightly so. Looking to the legal standard \nor reasoning applied would contradict EPA\u2019s long-held \nposition\u2014accepted by multiple courts of appeals\u2014that \nonly \u201cthe face\u201d of the challenged action matters for venue, \nnot the action\u2019s reasoning or effects. See p. 28, supra.9 \nb. EPA\u2019s argument that the actions here were nation-\nally applicable because of geography rests on two errone-\nous premises. First, as discussed just above in Part B.1, it \nwrongly assumes the relevant \u201cactions\u201d are the two docu-\nments explaining EPA\u2019s reasons for denying 105 individ-\nually submitted hardship petitions. \u201c[T]hrow[ing] a \nblanket labeled \u2018national\u2019 over [105] individual decisions\u201d \ndoes not \u201cconvert\u201d them \u201cinto \u2026 national one[s].\u201d West \nVirginia, 90 F.4th at 330. That is especially so when EPA \n \n9  Biofuel respondents\u2019 argument (at Br. 36) that \u201csmall- \nrefinery exemption decisions\u201d are \u201cinherently nationally appli-\ncable\u201d because they affect \u201cthe amount of renewable fuel that \nobligated parties must inject into the nation\u2019s transportation-\nfuel supply\u201d fails for the same reason. The \u201capplicability\u201d in-\nquiry is unconcerned with the \u201cpractical effects\u201d of the EPA \naction. American Road, 705 F.3d at 456 (Kavanaugh, J.). Espe-\ncially a downstream issue like whether EPA chooses to adjust \nvolume obligations for other parties based on outcomes of small \nrefineries\u2019 hardship petitions. \n\n \n40 \nwas able to get all of these individual decisions under its \npurportedly \u201cnational\u201d blanket only by refusing to follow \nthe CAA\u2019s 90-day deadline for answering the hardship  \npetitions. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(iii). Courts generally \u201cwill not \nsuffer a party to profit by his own wrongdoing.\u201d United \nStates v. Houlihan, 92 F.3d 1271, 1279 (1st Cir. 1996). And \nthe government \u201cshould turn square corners in dealing \nwith the people.\u201d Department of Homeland Sec. v.  \nRegents of the Univ. of California, 591 U.S. 1, 24 (2020)  \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \nSecond, EPA now reads the statutory phrase \u201cthe  \nappropriate circuit\u201d to mean that \u201cany action that spans \nmore than one judicial circuit is properly viewed as \u2018na-\ntionally applicable\u2019 and subject to review only in the D.C. \nCircuit.\u201d U.S. Br. 21-22 (quoting \u00a7 7607(b)(1)). According \nto the government (U.S. Br. 21), \u201c[t]he statute\u2019s use of the \ndefinite article \u2026 indicates that, for any given locally or \nregionally applicable EPA action, there is only one appro-\npriate regional court of appeals in which to seek review.\u201d \nThat reading is incorrect. \nNothing in Section 7607(b)(1) indicates that the phrase \n\u201cthe appropriate circuit\u201d informs the meaning of \u201cnation-\nally applicable,\u201d and the plain meaning of \u201cnationally  \napplicable\u201d contradicts EPA\u2019s reading. \u201cNationally\u201d \nmeans \u201cwith regard to the nation as a whole.\u201d Nationally, \nTHE OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY (1971); see Ken-\ntucky, 123 F.4th at 459 (same). Yet on EPA\u2019s reading, an \naction applying to far less than the whole nation\u2014say, one \napplying only to Mississippi and Alabama\u2014would be  \n\u201cnationally applicable.\u201d That is a stretch, to say the least. \nEven accepting arguendo EPA\u2019s view of the relevant \nfinal action, the April and June 2022 Denials were not \u201cna-\ntionally applicable\u201d because they did not cover the whole \nnation like the enumerated actions in Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s \n\n \n41 \nfirst sentence do. They applied to (and bound) only those \nsmall refineries that petitioned for an exemption. See \nPet.App.11a-12a.  \nThe ordinary meaning of \u201cregionally applicable\u201d also \nrebuts EPA\u2019s proffered reading, because that term con-\ntemplates agency actions applying in multiple places \nwithin a region: \u201cof or pertaining to, or connected with, a \nparticular region.\u201d Regional, THE OXFORD ENGLISH \nDICTIONARY (1971). Indeed, EPA\u2019s attempt to put so \nmuch weight on a single definite article produces textually \nabsurd results. Consider EPA\u2019s 250 air quality control  \nregions, some of which cover large metropolitan areas \nthat happen to cross State (and circuit) lines.10 \u201cMetropol-\nitan St. Louis\u201d (Region 70) and \u201cMetropolitan Kansas City\u201d \n(Region 90) are two examples. Can there be any doubt \nthat an EPA disapproval of a regional implementation \nplan for only Region 90 (Metropolitan Kansas City) is a \n\u201cregionally applicable\u201d action for purposes of Section \n7607(b)(1), even though that action touches both the \nEighth and Tenth Circuits? \nCongress did not think so. The 1970 Senate Report  \ninvoked by the government (U.S. Br. 23) said that \u201cimple-\nmentation plans which run only to one air quality control \nregion\u201d should be reviewed in the circuit court \u201cin which \nthe affected air quality control region, or portion thereof, \nis located.\u201d S. Rep. No. 1196, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 41 (1970) \n(emphasis added). Yet according to the government (U.S. \nBr. 22), the circuit courts governing the States affected by \na Kansas City regional action are powerless because \u201cany \naction that spans more than one judicial circuit\u201d must go \nexclusively to the D.C. Circuit. \n \n10 \nSee \nhttps://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/documents/codeta-\nbles/aqcrs.html. \n\n \n42 \nThe Senate Report supports what ordinary usage sug-\ngests about the meaning of \u201cthe appropriate circuit.\u201d \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1) (emphasis added). The use of \u201cthe appropri-\nate circuit\u201d rather than \u201cthe appropriate circuit(s)\u201d re-\nflects merely that Congress often doesn\u2019t legislate with \nlaser-like precision. E.g., United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. \n336, 344 (1971) (\u201cwe cannot pretend that all statutes are \nmodel statutes\u201d). For most EPA final actions (properly \nidentified), it will be readily apparent whether the action \napplies to the whole nation or to some subset\u2014and in the \nlatter instance, which circuit court is \u201cappropriate.\u201d That \nis certainly true for EPA\u2019s RFS hardship decisions, which \naffect only individual small refineries. \nc. Taken together, EPA\u2019s arguments reveal the \nagency\u2019s conscious desire for the power to choose where \nits actions are reviewed. EPA says (U.S. Br. 28-29) that \n\u201caction \u2026 under this chapter\u201d means its own \u201ccharacteri-\nzation\u201d of an action, which courts cannot \u201csecond-guess.\u201d \nAnd EPA further says (U.S. Br. 22) that any time an  \naction affects states or parties in more than one circuit, it \nis automatically entitled to D.C. Circuit review. If EPA \nwere right about both, then the agency could nearly al-\nways manufacture venue in the D.C. Circuit. EPA could \nsimply mush together two small refineries\u2019 RFS hardship \ndecisions, or decisions on two States\u2019 implementation \nplans\u2014even two decisions that have nothing to do with \neach other\u2014and thereby deny the regulated parties the \nopportunity for review by a regional circuit court. \nThe text of Section 7607(b)(1) does not allow that  \nmanipulation. \u201c[V]enue provisions in Acts of Congress \nshould not be so freely construed as to give the Govern-\nment the choice of \u2018a tribunal favorable\u2019 to it.\u201d Travis v. \nUnited States, 364 U.S. 631, 634 (1961) (citation omitted). \n\n \n43 \n3. The hardship decisions were not based on a \ndetermination of nationwide scope or effect. \nEPA asserts (U.S. Br. 33-35) that its individual denial \ndecisions were based on two determinations of nationwide \nscope or effect: \u201cEPA\u2019s revised interpretation of the rele-\nvant CAA provisions and the RIN discount and RIN cost \npassthrough principles.\u201d Pet.App.187a-188a. That mis-\ncharacterizes both the statutory text and the final actions. \na. As an initial matter, neither EPA\u2019s statutory inter-\npretation nor its economic hypothesis was a statutory  \n\u201cdetermination\u201d as the CAA uses that term of art. See pp. \n32-34, supra. Neither describes any issue that the CAA\u2019s \ntext directed EPA to \u201cdetermine\u201d before acting on a small  \nrefinery\u2019s RFS hardship petition. See \u00a7 7545(o)(9).  \nIn the immediately preceding subsection, Congress  \ninstructed EPA to extend two-year hardship exemptions \nbased on DOE\u2019s \u201cdetermin[ation]\u201d about a small refin-\nery\u2019s hardship. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(A)(ii)(II). And elsewhere in \nthe same Section, Congress authorized EPA to grant cer-\ntain waivers, following consultation with DOE, \u201cbased on \na determination by the Administrator \u2026 that implemen-\ntation of the requirement would severely harm the econ-\nomy or environment of a State, a region, or the United \nStates.\u201d \u00a7 7545(o)(7)(A)(i).  \nCongress thus knows how to make actions \u201cbased on a \ndetermination\u201d when it wants to. It did not do that for \nsmall-refinery hardship petitions in Section 7545(o)(9)(B). \nEPA\u2019s position wrongly depends on treating \u201cdetermina-\ntion\u201d in Section 7607(b)(1) not as a statutory term of art \nbut rather as some amorphous concept of anything that \ncontributed significantly to a final action.  \nb. Even if Section 7607(b)(1) used \u201cdetermination\u201d in \nthe colloquial sense, EPA would still be wrong about the \nbasis for these hardship-petition denial actions. \n\n \n44 \ni. EPA\u2019s first suggestion\u2014that a statutory interpre-\ntation can qualify as a \u201cdetermination of nationwide scope \nor effect\u201d\u2014is nothing less than an argument that every \nEPA action must go to the D.C. Circuit. EPA is a \u201ccrea-\nture[ ] of statute,\u201d so \u201cit possess[es] only the authority that \nCongress has provided.\u201d National Fed\u2019n of Indep. Bus. v. \nDep\u2019t of Lab., Occupational Safety & Health Admin., 595 \nU.S. 109, 117, (2022). Every EPA action is necessarily \n\u201cbased on\u201d the agency\u2019s understanding of its statutory  \nauthority. \nIt similarly cannot be the case (contra U.S. Br. 34) that \nEPA\u2019s denial actions here were based on a nationwide  \ndetermination because EPA applied a statutory interpre-\ntation \u201cuniformly\u201d to them. If EPA had not done that\u2014if \nit had applied a different statutory reading to similarly \nsituated small-refinery petitioners\u2014that would be the \nheight of arbitrariness. So \u201cif application of a national \nstandard \u2026 were the controlling factor, there never could \nbe a local or regional action\u201d because every EPA action \n\u201cpurportedly applies a national standard created by the \nnational statute and its national regulations.\u201d West Vir-\nginia, 90 F.4th at 329-330. This Court should not read the \nnarrow nationwide-scope-or-effect exception to \u201cswallow \nthe\u201d local-or-regionally-applicable rule. Cuomo v. Clear-\ning House Ass\u2019n, L.L.C., 557 U.S. 519, 530 (2009). \nThe most obvious examples of locally applicable  \nactions involve EPA applying a uniform statutory stand-\nard to individual regulated parties\u2019 factual circumstances. \nAccord U.S. Br. 42. Acknowledging that reality, EPA  \nultimately abandons any argument based on application \nof a \u201cuniform\u201d standard, conceding (U.S. Br. 41) that EPA \n\u201cdoes not\u201d make a nationwide-scope determination \u201cwhen \nit merely applies a previously established agency \u2026 inter-\npretation to new \u2018locally or regionally applicable\u2019 circum-\n\n \n45 \nstances.\u201d That describes what EPA did in the final actions \nchallenged here: It applied its statutory interpretation to \neach petitioning small refinery\u2019s evidence about its local \neconomic circumstances. See pp. 34-35, supra. \nInsofar as EPA contends (U.S. Br. 33, 41) that what \nmatters here is that it promulgated its \u201cnew interpreta-\ntion\u201d at \u201croughly the same time\u201d it denied the hardship \npetitions, that argument does not rebut the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \nvenue conclusion. For one thing, that argument would not \nextend to the June 2022 Denial decisions, which merely \napplied the statutory interpretation that EPA had an-\nnounced months earlier in April. Pet.App.80a.11 \nIn any event, EPA\u2019s choice to offer a new statutory \nanalysis cannot alter what determination the statute  \nrequired as the basis for every small-refinery hardship \ndecision. The text does not ask whether the agency made \nsome determination of nationwide scope or effect in con-\nnection with the action. It asks whether EPA \u201cbased\u201d its \nfinal action on such a determination. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). Here, as \nexplained above, the basis for these final actions must by \nlaw be findings about the individual petitioning small  \n \n11  Despite EPA repeatedly referring to the April and June \nDenials as two separate actions, EPA simultaneously argues \nthat those explanation documents should be treated as one for \npurposes of establishing its new adjudication approach to hard-\nship petitions. U.S. Br. 42-43 n.6. EPA urges this Court (ibid.) \nto disregard the \u201ctime that passed between the[ir] finalization\u201d \nbecause \u201c[b]oth denial actions here stemmed from a single \npropos[al].\u201d But obviously one proposal can lead ultimately to \nmultiple final actions. And according to the face of the June  \nexplanation document, it was only the April explanation docu-\nment that broke new ground: \u201cIn this action, EPA is applying \nthe approach proposed on December 7, 2021, and adopted in \nthe April 2022 [RFS] Denial.\u201d Pet.App.80a (emphases added). \n\n \n46 \nrefineries\u2019 economic circumstances. And EPA has admit-\nted that these hardship decisions were based on just that. \nSee p. 34, supra. \nMoreover, EPA\u2019s new statutory interpretation was \nnot sufficient to produce final agency action in this con-\ntext. Recall that EPA could not, and did not, use a rule-\nmaking for its new interpretation\u2014because to do so here \nwould plainly have been illegally retroactive. If EPA had \nwanted judicial review to focus on its new statutory inter-\npretation (U.S. Br. 42), it could have run a (lawful) rule-\nmaking process. But EPA expressly chose to proceed only \nby adjudication. See Pet.App.188 (\u201cThis action is not a \nrulemaking\u201d). That choice meant that EPA could produce \n\u201cfinal action \u2026 under this chapter\u201d not by analyzing the \nstatute but rather only by evaluating the petitioning small \nrefineries\u2019 economic evidence. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). \nIt is also no answer for EPA to contend (U.S. Br. 35, \n42) that a case must go to the D.C. Circuit when \u201ccircum-\nstances suggest\u201d that EPA\u2019s statutory interpretation is \n\u201clikely to be called into question\u201d in the litigation. That \nflies in the face of the courts\u2019 consistent holding (and \nEPA\u2019s consistent position) that what matters is EPA\u2019s  \n\u201cfinal action,\u201d not the petitioner\u2019s arguments challenging \nit. See pp. 7-8, supra. It will not always be apparent at the \noutset of litigation, when venue is typically (and most effi-\nciently) resolved, what aspects of an EPA action will be \ncalled into question. \nThe better answer is the simpler one that also gives \nthe statutory terms their ordinary meaning: An EPA  \naction is based on a determination of nationwide scope or \neffect in the rare instance when the CAA\u2019s text directs \nEPA to make a factual \u201cdetermination\u201d about the entire \nnation or industry, without the need to consider individual \ncircumstances. \n\n \n47 \nii. For many of the same reasons, EPA\u2019s RIN-cost-\npassthrough hypothesis did not make these hardship  \ndenial actions based on a determination of nationwide \nscope or effect. Even if EPA\u2019s passthrough hypothesis \ncould qualify as a \u201cdetermination\u201d under the statute when \nthe text does not describe it that way, see pp. 33-34, supra, \nthe actions denying the hardship petitions were not \n\u201cbased on\u201d it, \u00a7 7607(b)(1). EPA had merely a hypothe-\nsis\u2014an \u201canalysis of how\u201d EPA \u201cexpected\u201d individual fuels \nmarkets to respond, Pet.App.163a-165a\u2014that EPA \nneeded to test, and did test, against each hardship peti-\ntion\u2019s evidence. See pp. 34-35, supra. Only that analysis of \neach refinery\u2019s individual evidence could be the \u201cbas[is]\u201d \nfor \u201cfinal action[s]\u201d denying respondents\u2019 hardship peti-\ntions. \u00a7 7607(b)(1) (emphasis added). \nEPA\u2019s actions were not \u201cbased on\u201d any supposedly  \nnationwide RIN-cost-passthrough determination for the \nadditional reason that, with or without any nationwide  \nassessment, EPA\u2019s denial actions here would have been \nexactly the same. The government agrees (U.S. Br. 41) \nthat the textual \u201ccausation requirement\u201d in Section \n7607(b)(1) means that \u201cthe relevant determinations\u201d must \nbe \u201cat the core of EPA\u2019s action.\u201d But here, EPA did not \nneed any nationwide finding about any other refineries to \nconclude, as it wrongly did in the denial actions, that each \nof the small-refinery respondents were \u201cable to pass along \nRFS compliance costs,\u201d were \u201crecovering [their] costs,\u201d \nand so were suffering \u201cno economic harm.\u201d Pet.App.99a-\n100a, 165a; JA 280.  \nIn short, the conclusion that drove each denial decision \nwas not that all obligated parties recover their RFS costs; \nit was that each of these respondents (purportedly) does. \nAs EPA itself explains (U.S. Br. 10): It denied respond-\nents\u2019 hardship petitions because it \u201cdetermined that none \n\n \n48 \nof the petitioning small refineries had rebutted [the RIN-\ncost-passthrough] presumption through evidence about \ntheir specific circumstances.\u201d Those were conclusions \nabout specific refineries, not nationwide determinations.12 \nc. EPA invokes the history (U.S. Br. 35-38) of the \nthird-sentence exception in Section 7607(b)(1), but that \nhistory actually undermines EPA\u2019s position. As recounted \nabove, the exception was prompted by General Counsel \nFrick\u2019s description of an atypical CAA provision that, \nthough calling for a local action (an extension for specific \nStates), textually required EPA\u2019s action to be based on a \ndetermination about technology available throughout the \nindustry. See pp. 8-9, supra. That extension action did not \nrequire or even contemplate any consideration of individ-\nualized State circumstances; EPA was tasked instead \nwith making a finding about the technology available \nthroughout the nation. \nEPA\u2019s actions on small-refinery hardship petitions \nlook nothing like that. The text of Section 7545(o)(9)(B), \nunlike the unusual provision that Frick described, does \nnot ask EPA to make any \u201cdetermination\u201d about the  \nentire nation or industry as a basis for granting hardship \nrelief. It does not call for any determination at all. To the \nextent it does, it calls for a determination about the indi-\nvidual petitioning small refinery\u2019s economic circum-\nstances. See pp. 33-34, supra. \nEPA responds by catastrophizing (U.S. Br. 38) that if \nthe denials here do not qualify as based on nationwide  \n \n12  EPA\u2019s footnoted discussion (U.S. Br. 34 n.5) of how it \nchooses to respond to granted hardship petitions is irrelevant \nto Section 7607(b)(1), because those downstream choices by the \nagency say nothing about what was the \u201cbas[is]\u201d for the final \ndenial actions here. \n\n \n49 \ndeterminations, then the third-sentence exception to Sec-\ntion 7607(b)(1) will be \u201cpractically insignificant.\u201d But the \nthird sentence was always meant to state an exception to \nthe general rule for locally applicable actions. General \nCounsel Frick urged the exception\u2019s adoption to address \na CAA provision that has since been repealed. That is \nlikely why, before the cases involving EPA\u2019s denial deci-\nsions here, no court had ever found a locally applicable \nEPA action that was based on a determination of nation-\nwide scope or effect. The exception is properly narrow. \nd. EPA concludes by resorting to a policy argument: \nIt asks this Court to read \u201cbased on a determination of  \nnationwide scope or effect\u201d broadly, on the theory that  \njudicial review will be more efficient if the D.C. Circuit \nalone considers issues like EPA\u2019s statutory analysis and \nmethodological framework.  \nAppeals to policy cannot supersede the ordinary \nmeaning of the terms in Section 7607(b)(1) or the confir-\nmation of their meaning in the statutory context and his-\ntory. Niz-Chavez v. Garland, 593 U.S. 155, 171 (2021) (\u201cno \namount of policy-talk can overcome a plain statutory com-\nmand\u201d). And in any event, EPA\u2019s policy argument falls \nflat. If EPA wants to propound a new statutory interpre-\ntation and have it reviewed by only the D.C. Circuit, then \nthe agency need only adopt that interpretation through a \nlawful rulemaking process. \nExperience has proven EPA wrong in suggesting that \nconsolidated D.C. Circuit review of CAA actions is always \nor usually best. The litigation here is a perfect example. \nBecause EPA persuaded several regional circuit courts to \ntransfer small refineries\u2019 challenges to their hardship- \ndenial decisions, the D.C. Circuit ended up hearing one \nmassive case consolidating dozens of small refineries\u2019  \npetitions for review. See p. 18, supra. That consolidation \n\n \n50 \nmade the D.C. Circuit litigation take much longer than \nother small refineries\u2019 regional-circuit challenges to \nEPA\u2019s denials of their hardship petitions.  \nEven more important, consolidation in the D.C. Cir-\ncuit made it very difficult for the individual small refiner-\nies to get judicial attention on what ultimately matters \nmost: their specific economic circumstances that give rise \nto their disproportionate economic hardship from the \nRFS. To take just one example: In the mass D.C. Circuit \nchallenge alongside dozens of co-petitioners, there was no \neasy way for a small refinery affiliated with one respond-\nent here, Calumet Montana, to ask the court to focus on \nthe idiosyncrasies of producing blended diesel fuel in a \ncold climate in winter. Yet that is exactly the sort of con-\ndition that causes Calumet Montana to face dispropor-\ntionate economic hardship from the RFS. \nEPA\u2019s preference for near-universal D.C. Circuit  \nreview would obscure the judiciary\u2019s consideration of  \nindividual regulated entities\u2019 circumstances, contrary to \nthe essential logic of Congress\u2019s plan for a national vs.  \nlocal divide in Section 7607(b)(1). \n\n \n51 \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be af-\nfirmed. \nRespectfully submitted, \nLeAnn M.

It effectively synthesizes the core arguments from the petitioner and respondent briefs, demonstrating a solid grasp of the central legal dispute. More importantly, it correctly identifies the next logical and high-value step: examining amicus briefs. \n\nTask EIG (0.6): The action significantly advances the task by moving beyond the primary parties' arguments. By planning to analyze amicus briefs supporting the petitioner, the agent is setting up the acquisition of new information that could reveal alternative legal theories, policy arguments, or signals of broader support for the government's position, all of which are critical for predicting the Court's leanings. While the thought itself doesn't provide new data, its strategic planning is a major step toward a more nuanced and accurate prediction.\n\nDesign EIG (0.8): This action demonstrates a highly effective and generalizable strategy for SCOTUS case analysis. The pattern of (1) mastering the main briefs, then (2) systematically exploring amicus briefs to understand the wider context and persuasive pressures on the Court, is a sophisticated and reusable methodology. It mirrors how human legal experts approach case prediction, making it a valuable design pattern for the agent's reasoning process.\n\nThe combined value is high because this is not a trivial or procedural thought; it is a substantive act of strategic planning that directly shapes the subsequent, information-gathering actions in a highly effective way.",

The identity of the amici (e.g., states, industry groups, environmental organizations) provides important context about the real-world stakes and potential consequences of the Court's decision on this procedural question. This information is highly valuable for predicting how different Justices might weigh the arguments about whether the EPA's actions are 'nationally applicable'.\n\nDesign EIG (0.6): This action reinforces a systematic and effective strategy for case analysis: party briefs first, then amicus briefs. It allows for the refinement of the process of identifying and weighing different types of arguments and supporters. By observing which arguments amici choose to emphasize, I can learn about what experienced court-watchers believe will be most persuasive to the current Court, which is a valuable insight for improving the general prediction model.

CountryMark is \nowned by more than 140,000 farmers. It is headquartered \nin Indiana.\nCountryMark has a significant interest in this \nappeal because, while small refineries (rightly) prevailed \nin the recent Sinclair Wyoming decision in the D.C. \nCircuit, CountryMark did not get its own day in court \nto specifically and fully address the disproportionate \neconomic hardship that is suffers. CountryMark\u2019s case \nwas improperly consolidated with those of 25 other small \nrefineries. See Sinclair Wyoming Refin. Co. LLC v. EPA, \n101 F.4th 871 (D.C. Cir. 2024). As a result, CountryMark\u2019s \nparticular economic circumstances were mentioned in \njust two sentences in the briefs before the D.C. Circuit. It \nhad no chance to fully and fairly explain how denial of its \nhardship petitions could jeopardize its ability to continue \noperating.\nThe demise of CountryMark would significantly \nharm the rural region in which it operates. CountryMark \nemploys nearly 500 workers, concentrated in the rural \neconomy of southwest Indiana and southeast Illinois. \n1.\u2002 No counsel for a party authored this brief in whole or in \npart. No such counsel or a party made a monetary contribution \nintended to fund the preparation or submission of this brief. No \nperson other than the amicus curiae, its members, or its counsel, \nmade such a monetary contribution.\n\n2\nIn Posey County, Indiana, a county with only 25,000 \nresidents, CountryMark provides over $30 million in \nwages and benefits each year. In 2024, it purchased over \n$800 million of crude oil primarily from the Illinois Basin, \nand those purchases provided income to the 40,000 royalty \nowners in the Illinois Basin. Its products are also sold and \ndistributed through its branded dealer network, providing \nemployment throughout rural communities in its area.\nCountryMark is the only farmer-owned integrated \noil company in the United States, and it is recognized in \nIndiana as a leader in the distribution of biodiesel and \nethanol. Its refinery, which uses 100% American crude \noil, processes 35,000 barrels of crude per day. It supplies \nover 70% of agricultural market fuels and 50% of school \ndistrict fuels in Indiana. Although CountryMark is a \ncritical participant in its regional market, it operates as \na small refinery relative to its peers, with a capacity that \nis merely one-tenth the size of the average refinery in its \nregion.\nCountryMark is precisely the type of small refinery \nCongress envisioned when enacting Small Refinery \nExemptions (\u201cSRE\u201d). For CountryMark, SREs are not \na mechanism to avoid compliance with Congressional \nmandates; rather, they are vital tools to sustain economic \nviability while advancing renewable fuel adoption\u2014an \neffort CountryMark has championed since before such \nmandates existed.\nCountryMark is an Obligated Party under the \nRenewable Fuel Standard (\u201cRFS\u201d). Despite its early \nadoption of renewable fuels, CountryMark\u2019s customers \nare unable or unwilling to blend sufficient renewable \n\n3\nfuels to meet the company\u2019s annual RFS obligations. \nWhile CountryMark has invested significantly in blending \ninfrastructure, the continued escalation of Renewable \nVolume Obligations (\u201cRVOs\u201d), combined with rising \nRenewable Identification Number (\u201cRIN\u201d) prices, renders \ncompliance financially unsustainable without relief \nthrough SREs.\nTo address the economic hardship imposed by the \nRFS, CountryMark has sought SREs under the Clean \nAir Act (\u201cCAA\u201d). By statute, these exemptions must be \ndetermined based on the applicant\u2019s individual economic \ncircumstances. When the Environmental Protection \nAgency (\u201cEPA\u201d) denied CountryMark\u2019s RFS hardship \npetitions, CountryMark sought judicial review in its \nregional circuit. But, on EPA\u2019s motion, the cases were \ntransferred to the D.C. Circuit and consolidated with other \nrefineries\u2019 petitions, denying CountryMark its statutory \nright to review of its particular economic hardships by \nits regional circuit. CountryMark thus has significant \ninterest in this Court\u2019s affirmance of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \ndetermination that the proper venue for review of EPA\u2019s \ndecisions on SRE petitions is the small refinery\u2019s regional \ncircuit.\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\nThe Fifth Circuit correctly determined that the \nproper venue for judicial review of EPA\u2019s decision on \nSRE petitions is the regional circuit of the petitioning \nsmall refinery. The specific economic circumstances of \nthe small refinery and the area in which it operates are \nthe statutorily required and exclusive bases for EPA \ndeterminations of RFS hardship applications. A small \n\n4\nrefinery is almost by definition a local or regional concern. \nSee 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07545(o)(1)(K). Thus, the SRE applicant\u2019s \nregional circuit is best suited to address the application \nand the local economic realities that should underlie EPA\u2019s \ndecision.\nCongress concluded that localized EPA decisions \nshould be reviewed by local jurisdictions. 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a07607(b)(1). That is a rational division of labor for at least \nthree reasons.\nFirst, local jurisdictions are best equipped to render \ndecisions based on local economic realities. Indeed, in \nlarge measure, that is the very purpose of having regional \ncourts of appeals. EPA, along with supporting amici from \ntrade associations that represent non-obligated entities, \nwrongly assume that fuel prices are generally set in the \ncontext of a national market. All states and regions have \ndifferent fuel prices, which are driven by the supply and \ndemand in local markets. Anyone who travels regularly \ncan attest that fuel prices in Indiana, California, and \nLouisiana differ widely\u2014driven by local or regional supply \nand demand. Fuel prices in Posey County in southern \nIndiana are noticeably different from those of Chicago-\nadjacent Lake County, Indiana. CountryMark, which is an \nObligated Party, operates wholesale terminals in several \nmarkets and experiences these local economic differences \nevery day. This reinforces the need for review of EPA \ndecisions in the SRE applicant\u2019s regional circuit.\nSecond, distributing localized EPA actions among \nthe regional circuits ensures that petitioners get the \nindividualized review that the CAA contemplates. The \nCAA directs EPA to evaluate \u201ca\u201d hardship petition \nbased on whether the particular petitioner would face \n\n5\na \u201cdisproportionate economic hardship\u201d if required to \ncomply with renewable fuel standards. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07545(o)\n(9)(B)(i-ii). It naturally follows that the denial of an SRE \nhardship petition will also get individualized attention in \nthe appropriate court of appeals. But in the joint opening \nbrief in Sinclair Wyoming, CountryMark\u2019s unique \ncircumstances got just two sentences\u2014totaling 60 words. \nAnd CountryMark was not mentioned at all in the joint \nreply brief. CountryMark has a greater opportunity to \ndiscuss its economic hardship in this amicus brief than it \nhad to explain them in Sinclair Wyoming, where it was a \nparty and its own petition was reviewed.\nThird, individual petitioners are more likely to get \nthe timely review required by the CAA if the workload is \ndispersed among the regional circuits. The CAA directs \nEPA to act on an SRE hardship petition within 90 days \nof receipt. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07545(o)(9)(B)(iii). As Respondents \nexplain, EPA ignored that deadline and deprived many \nSRE petitioners of their right to timely review. See \nRespondents Br. 17, 25-26, 39-40 (Jan. 21, 2025). That \ndelay was exacerbated by the consolidation of dozens of \npetitions in the D.C. Circuit. The Fifth Circuit handled \nits petitions for review months before the D.C. Circuit \nadjudicated its bundle of consolidated cases.\nEPA is wrong to assert that venue lies exclusively in \nthe D.C. Circuit for every petitioner seeking appeal of an \nSRE hardship petition ruling. EPA is wrong about the \nfuel market: fuel prices are local and regional rather than \nnational. And EPA is wrong about the process here. Venue \nshould not shift to the D.C. Circuit merely because EPA \nbundled quintessentially local SRE hardship petitions \ntogether.\n\n6\nARGUMENT\n1.\t CountryMark\u2019s local market conditions dictate \nwhether it can meet the federal renewable fuels \nmandate.\nThe individualized nature of SRE hardship petitions \nmakes regional circuits the \u201cappropriate circuit[s]\u201d \nunder the CAA\u2019s venue provision, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07607(b)(1). \nIndiana-based CountryMark\u2019s SRE petitions should be \nreviewed in the Seventh Circuit. Sending them to the \nD.C. Circuit undermines the statutory framework of the \nCAA. This brief focuses on the practical effects that the \nvenue decision has on a small refinery like CountryMark.\nCountryMark is a quintessential small refinery. It \nis a farmer-owned cooperative that was advancing the \nuse of renewable fuels even before it was subject to a \nfederal law mandate. However, it faces disproportionate \neconomic hardship compared to other refineries\u2014even \nother small refineries\u2014because of circumstances specific \nto its ownership and marketplace.\nCountryMark has invested in fuel blending \ninfrastructure that remains capable of blending enough \nrenewable fuels to meet its annual obligation. But despite \nCountryMark\u2019s infrastructure and a customer base that \nembraced renewable fuels early, CountryMark\u2019s customers \nsimply do not want\u2014and thus will not purchase\u2014the \nhigher renewable fuel blends required for CountryMark\u2019s \ncompliance with EPA mandates.\nCustomers select the percentage of renewable fuels to \nbe blended into their gasoline and diesel when they choose \nwhich fuel mix to purchase. The customer\u2019s preferences \n\n7\nin CountryMark\u2019s market are specific to CountryMark \nand are not \u201cnational\u201d in any sense. In CountryMark\u2019s \nmarketplace, demand remains low for higher blends. \nFor example, E85 (a fuel product typically containing \n85% ethanol and 15% gasoline) is not widely accepted by \nCountryMark\u2019s consumers regardless of price because it \nhas less energy per gallon compared to E10 (10% ethanol; \n90% gasoline).2 That low demand is essentially immune \nto price changes. These local retail economics impact \nCountryMark\u2019s ability to sell fuel blends in sufficient \nquantities to achieve CountryMark\u2019s RVO compliance \nlevels.\nCountryMark\u2019s blend percentages are below the \nfederal government\u2019s CAA mandate because of its \ncustomers\u2019 preferences. They purchase less of the \nhigher fuel blends, resulting in CountryMark\u2019s achieving \nlower blending percentages than the mandate requires. \nCountryMark must then purchase RINs (compliance \ncredits) to achieve RFS compliance. The combination \nof mandated RVO increases above CountryMark\u2019s \nmarketplace\u2019s demand, plus increasing RIN prices, makes \ncontinued compliance practically impossible, and SREs \nvital. Without SREs, CountryMark\u2019s long-term viability \nis threatened.\nAnother economic circumstance specific to \nCountryMark is its disproportionate blending of diesel \n2.\u2002 Ethanol, U.S. Dep\u2019t of Energy, https://www.fueleconomy.\ngov/feg/ethanol.shtml (last visited Jan. 27, 2025) (\u201cDue to ethanol\u2019s \nlower energy content, [flex fuel vehicles] operating on E85 get \nroughly 15% to 27% fewer miles per gallon than when operating \non regular gasoline, depending on the ethanol content. Regular \ngasoline typically contains about 10% ethanol.\u201d).\n\n8\nversus gasoline. CountryMark first blended biodiesel \nin 2006, and it is today considered a leader of biodiesel \nblending in Indiana.3 Unsurprisingly, its farmer members \nand their rural customers require more diesel fuel than \ngasoline.\nCountryMark consequently operates its refinery to \nmaximize diesel fuel production to meet the requirements \nof its diesel-centric farmer members and customers. \nBecause of CountryMark\u2019s local customer demand, \nCountryMark sells more diesel fuel through its member \nretail network than it can produce at its refinery, so it must \npurchase diesel from other suppliers to meet customer \ndemand.\nEven though biodiesel helps meet this demand, \ncustomers strongly disfavor it, and therefore buy much \nless of it. This results in a disproportionate economic \nhardship for CountryMark compared to other refiners. \nAnd to preclude all doubt, the Department of Energy \nhas recognized that high diesel production is a criteria \nfor disproportionate economic harm in its small refinery \nexemption study.4 This is exacerbated for CountryMark.\nCountryMark\u2019s customers are integrated with the \nagricultural community, and they are knowledgeable \nusers of renewable fuels\u2014both ethanol and biodiesel. \nImportantly, CountryMark\u2019s customers are aware \n3.\u2002 Meggie Foster, CountryMark Debuts New Brand, Re-\nenergized Vision, Farm World (Jun. 20, 2007), http://www.\nfarmworldonline.com/news/ArchiveArticle.asp?newsid=4377.\n4.\u2002 U.S. Dep\u2019t of Energy, Small Refinery Exemption Study: An \nInvestigation into Disproportionate Economic Hardship 33 (Mar. \n2011), https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-12/documents/\nsmall-refinery-exempt-study.pdf.\n\n9\nthat biodiesel does not work well in cold temperatures, \nfor which Indiana winters are well known. This is an \nacute concern for agricultural consumers because \nthey frequently store diesel fuel on-site, year-round. \nConsequently, CountryMark can sell less than 2% of \nbiodiesel on an annual average basis as a percentage of \nall diesel sales. Contrast this with non-obligated parties \nlike large truck stops who sell to on-road truckers. Truck \nstops can routinely blend 20% biodiesel in their product \nbecause on-road truckers immediately consume the fuel, \nand thus do not have to worry about exposing that diesel \nfuel to the elements in longer-term storage.\nThese local marketplace factors preclude \nCountryMark\u2019s opportunity to blend biodiesel into diesel \nfuel, as compared to blending ethanol into gasoline. \nEven if CountryMark were to try to force a 5% biodiesel \nblend on customers, that would not be enough to meet \nCountryMark\u2019s RFS obligations. Since higher biodiesel \nblends are not as accepted in the market, CountryMark \ndoes not sell as many biodiesel blends at 10% or higher.\nWithout having the ability to sell higher renewable \nblends in diesel fuel, CountryMark is structurally \ndisadvantaged compared to other refineries. By favoring \nthe production of diesel fuel to meet the needs of its \nregional agricultural market, CountryMark does not \nproduce enough gasoline for ethanol blending at any \npercentage that would eliminate the need to purchase \nhigh-priced RINs.\nCountryMark operates in a volatile fuel market and \nits disproportionate economic hardship is structural. \nCountryMark produces more diesel fuel than a typical \n\n10\nrefinery to serve its farmer-owners, and it is located in \nan extremely competitive market with multiple refineries, \npipelines, and terminals. \nAs a result, EPA needs to reevaluate each year whether \nthe exemption should be extended to CountryMark, \njust as Congress directed. When EPA gets the SRE \ndetermination wrong, CountryMark should be heard \nindividually, not bundled with other geographically \ndispersed SRE petitioners. And its statutory venue is the \nSeventh Circuit, its regional court of appeals.\n2.\t CountryMark lost its opportunity for individualized \njudicial review of the denial of its SRE hardship \npetition.\nCountryMark filed a petition for review of EPA\u2019s denial \nof its hardship petition for 2018 in the Seventh Circuit in \nMay 2022.5 In this petition, CountryMark sought to bring \nbefore its regional circuit its unique and local economic \nfactors. Instead of consideration by the Seventh Circuit \nof these CountryMark-centric economics factors, the case \nwas transferred to the D.C. Circuit on EPA\u2019s motion.6\nCountryMark also filed a petition for review of EPA\u2019s \ndenial of its hardship petitions for 2019, 2020, and 2021 \nin the Seventh Circuit in August 2022.7 As with the May \n5.\u2002 See Petition for Review, Countrymark Refin. and Logistics, \nLLC v. EPA, No. 22-1878 (7th Cir. May 18, 2022).\n6.\u2002 See Order Granting EPA\u2019s Motion to Transfer, Countrymark \nRefin. and Logistics, LLC v. EPA, No. 22-1878 (7th Cir.

Aug. 3, 2022).\n\n11\npetition for review, the August petition was transferred \nto the D.C. Circuit on EPA\u2019s motion.8 CountryMark\u2019s \npetitions for review were consolidated with 25 other small \nrefineries into an omnibus case in the D.C. Circuit. See \nSinclair Wyoming Refin. Co. LLC, et al. v. EPA, No. 22-\n1073 (D.C. Cir.).\nIn the small refinery petitioners\u2019 joint opening brief \nin Sinclair Wyoming, CountryMark\u2019s unique economic \ncircumstances got two sentences\u2014just 60 words in an \nopening brief of 23,970 words.9 And in the joint reply brief \nthere was no room to mention CountryMark\u2019s specific, \nlocal economics at all.10 Owing to the consolidated nature \nof the case, CountryMark could spend just two sentences \nexplaining why millions of dollars of compliance costs \nunder the RFS created disproportionate hardship for \nCountryMark and threatened its continued financial \nviability.\nIt is hard to see how CountryMark\u2019s appeal could \nreceive the individualized attention it is entitled to \nwithin just 0.025% of the opening brief\u2014and none of \nthe reply. If CountryMark had remained in the Seventh \n8.\u2002 See Order Granting EPA\u2019s Motion to Transfer, Countrymark \nRefin. and Logistics, LLC v. EPA, No. 22-2368 (7th Cir.

CountryMark would have been able to explain \nits particular operations, customers, and market factors. \nIts hardships would have been fully and fairly considered \nby judges in CountryMark\u2019s regional circuit, as Congress \nintended.\n3.\t CountryMark lost its opportunity for timely \njudicial review of the denial of its SRE hardship \npetition.\nCongress recognized that the CAA\u2019s fuel mandates \ncould pose an existential threat to smaller refineries, hence \nthe exemption system for refiners facing \u201cdisproportionate \nhardship.\u201d A smaller refinery facing this existential threat \nneeds timely review of its SRE hardship petition. So the \nCAA directs EPA to act on an SRE hardship petition \nwithin 90 days of receipt. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07545(o)(9)(B)(iii). \nNeedless to say, if EPA denies a hardship petition, the \nsmall refinery also needs timely adjudication of its petition \nfor review of that decision; vindication delivered months, \nand in some cases, years, too late is small comfort.\nThe dozens of SRE petitioners, including CountryMark, \nwho were bundled together in the D.C. Circuit in Sinclair \nWyoming filed SRE hardship petitions as early as 2016, \nreceived denials from EPA in April and June 2022, and \nwere given judicial decisions in the D.C. Circuit in July \n11.\u2002 Seventh Circuit Local Rule 32(c).\n\n13\n2024. Sinclair Wyoming Refin. Co. LLC v. EPA, 114 F.4th \n696, 704 (D.C. Cir. 2024). That means that for more than \nhalf of the existence of the renewable fuel mandate, small \nrefineries like CountryMark have operated in regulatory \nuncertainty that threatened their very existence. See 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07545(o)(9)(A)(i) (directing that the renewable \nfuel mandate will apply to small refineries beginning in \n2011). It is true that much of the delay is attributable to \nEPA\u2019s failure to act on the petitions in a timely fashion.12 \nBut not all. \nVenue mattered. The Fifth Circuit declined to transfer \nits petitions to the D.C. Circuit. It resolved both the venue \ndispute and the merits of those petitions eight months \nbefore the D.C. Circuit adjudicated the dozens of petitions \nbundled together in the April and June 2022 denials. See \nCalumet Shreveport Refin., LLC v. EPA, 86 F.4th 1121 \n(5th Cir. 2023). The distributed workload designed by \nCongress is better suited for timely adjudication of SRE \nhardship petitions. Delayed decision-making leads to \ngreater economic uncertainty. Along with the threats of \nincreasing RVOs and rising RIN prices, delay undermines \nCountryMark\u2019s ability to plan for the future and maintain \nits economic viability for its 140,000 farmer-owners and \ntheir customers.\n12.\u2002 Respondents ably explain why EPA should not be allowed \nto use that unlawful delay to turn dozens of local decisions into \none or two \u201cnational\u201d ones. Respondents Br. 17, 25-26, 39-40 (Jan. \n21, 2025).\n\n14\nCONCLUSION\nCountryMark exemplifies the localized challenges \nfaced by small refineries. Its operations are deeply \nembedded in the region within which it operates. These \nunique regional dynamics are best understood and \nadjudicated within CountryMark\u2019s regional circuit.\nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s venue ruling should be upheld to \nensure that EPA\u2019s actions on SRE applicants\u2019 petitions \nare reviewed within the applicants\u2019 regional circuits. \nThis approach respects the individualized nature of SRE \ndeterminations, reinforces s\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

CountryMark is \nowned by more than 140,000 farmers. It is headquartered \nin Indiana.\nCountryMark has a significant interest in this \nappeal because, while small refineries (rightly) prevailed \nin the recent Sinclair Wyoming decision in the D.C. \nCircuit, CountryMark did not get its own day in court \nto specifically and fully address the disproportionate \neconomic hardship that is suffers. CountryMark\u2019s case \nwas improperly consolidated with those of 25 other small \nrefineries. See Sinclair Wyoming Refin. Co. LLC v. EPA, \n101 F.4th 871 (D.C. Cir. 2024). As a result, CountryMark\u2019s \nparticular economic circumstances were mentioned in \njust two sentences in the briefs before the D.C. Circuit. It \nhad no chance to fully and fairly explain how denial of its \nhardship petitions could jeopardize its ability to continue \noperating.\nThe demise of CountryMark would significantly \nharm the rural region in which it operates. CountryMark \nemploys nearly 500 workers, concentrated in the rural \neconomy of southwest Indiana and southeast Illinois. \n1.\u2002 No counsel for a party authored this brief in whole or in \npart. No such counsel or a party made a monetary contribution \nintended to fund the preparation or submission of this brief. No \nperson other than the amicus curiae, its members, or its counsel, \nmade such a monetary contribution.\n\n2\nIn Posey County, Indiana, a county with only 25,000 \nresidents, CountryMark provides over $30 million in \nwages and benefits each year. In 2024, it purchased over \n$800 million of crude oil primarily from the Illinois Basin, \nand those purchases provided income to the 40,000 royalty \nowners in the Illinois Basin. Its products are also sold and \ndistributed through its branded dealer network, providing \nemployment throughout rural communities in its area.\nCountryMark is the only farmer-owned integrated \noil company in the United States, and it is recognized in \nIndiana as a leader in the distribution of biodiesel and \nethanol. Its refinery, which uses 100% American crude \noil, processes 35,000 barrels of crude per day. It supplies \nover 70% of agricultural market fuels and 50% of school \ndistrict fuels in Indiana. Although CountryMark is a \ncritical participant in its regional market, it operates as \na small refinery relative to its peers, with a capacity that \nis merely one-tenth the size of the average refinery in its \nregion.\nCountryMark is precisely the type of small refinery \nCongress envisioned when enacting Small Refinery \nExemptions (\u201cSRE\u201d). For CountryMark, SREs are not \na mechanism to avoid compliance with Congressional \nmandates; rather, they are vital tools to sustain economic \nviability while advancing renewable fuel adoption\u2014an \neffort CountryMark has championed since before such \nmandates existed.\nCountryMark is an Obligated Party under the \nRenewable Fuel Standard (\u201cRFS\u201d). Despite its early \nadoption of renewable fuels, CountryMark\u2019s customers \nare unable or unwilling to blend sufficient renewable \n\n3\nfuels to meet the company\u2019s annual RFS obligations. \nWhile CountryMark has invested significantly in blending \ninfrastructure, the continued escalation of Renewable \nVolume Obligations (\u201cRVOs\u201d), combined with rising \nRenewable Identification Number (\u201cRIN\u201d) prices, renders \ncompliance financially unsustainable without relief \nthrough SREs.\nTo address the economic hardship imposed by the \nRFS, CountryMark has sought SREs under the Clean \nAir Act (\u201cCAA\u201d). By statute, these exemptions must be \ndetermined based on the applicant\u2019s individual economic \ncircumstances. When the Environmental Protection \nAgency (\u201cEPA\u201d) denied CountryMark\u2019s RFS hardship \npetitions, CountryMark sought judicial review in its \nregional circuit. But, on EPA\u2019s motion, the cases were \ntransferred to the D.C. Circuit and consolidated with other \nrefineries\u2019 petitions, denying CountryMark its statutory \nright to review of its particular economic hardships by \nits regional circuit. CountryMark thus has significant \ninterest in this Court\u2019s affirmance of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \ndetermination that the proper venue for review of EPA\u2019s \ndecisions on SRE petitions is the small refinery\u2019s regional \ncircuit.\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\nThe Fifth Circuit correctly determined that the \nproper venue for judicial review of EPA\u2019s decision on \nSRE petitions is the regional circuit of the petitioning \nsmall refinery. The specific economic circumstances of \nthe small refinery and the area in which it operates are \nthe statutorily required and exclusive bases for EPA \ndeterminations of RFS hardship applications. A small \n\n4\nrefinery is almost by definition a local or regional concern. \nSee 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07545(o)(1)(K). Thus, the SRE applicant\u2019s \nregional circuit is best suited to address the application \nand the local economic realities that should underlie EPA\u2019s \ndecision.\nCongress concluded that localized EPA decisions \nshould be reviewed by local jurisdictions. 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a07607(b)(1). That is a rational division of labor for at least \nthree reasons.\nFirst, local jurisdictions are best equipped to render \ndecisions based on local economic realities. Indeed, in \nlarge measure, that is the very purpose of having regional \ncourts of appeals. EPA, along with supporting amici from \ntrade associations that represent non-obligated entities, \nwrongly assume that fuel prices are generally set in the \ncontext of a national market. All states and regions have \ndifferent fuel prices, which are driven by the supply and \ndemand in local markets. Anyone who travels regularly \ncan attest that fuel prices in Indiana, California, and \nLouisiana differ widely\u2014driven by local or regional supply \nand demand. Fuel prices in Posey County in southern \nIndiana are noticeably different from those of Chicago-\nadjacent Lake County, Indiana. CountryMark, which is an \nObligated Party, operates wholesale terminals in several \nmarkets and experiences these local economic differences \nevery day. This reinforces the need for review of EPA \ndecisions in the SRE applicant\u2019s regional circuit.\nSecond, distributing localized EPA actions among \nthe regional circuits ensures that petitioners get the \nindividualized review that the CAA contemplates. The \nCAA directs EPA to evaluate \u201ca\u201d hardship petition \nbased on whether the particular petitioner would face \n\n5\na \u201cdisproportionate economic hardship\u201d if required to \ncomply with renewable fuel standards. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07545(o)\n(9)(B)(i-ii). It naturally follows that the denial of an SRE \nhardship petition will also get individualized attention in \nthe appropriate court of appeals. But in the joint opening \nbrief in Sinclair Wyoming, CountryMark\u2019s unique \ncircumstances got just two sentences\u2014totaling 60 words. \nAnd CountryMark was not mentioned at all in the joint \nreply brief. CountryMark has a greater opportunity to \ndiscuss its economic hardship in this amicus brief than it \nhad to explain them in Sinclair Wyoming, where it was a \nparty and its own petition was reviewed.\nThird, individual petitioners are more likely to get \nthe timely review required by the CAA if the workload is \ndispersed among the regional circuits. The CAA directs \nEPA to act on an SRE hardship petition within 90 days \nof receipt. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07545(o)(9)(B)(iii). As Respondents \nexplain, EPA ignored that deadline and deprived many \nSRE petitioners of their right to timely review. See \nRespondents Br. 17, 25-26, 39-40 (Jan. 21, 2025). That \ndelay was exacerbated by the consolidation of dozens of \npetitions in the D.C. Circuit. The Fifth Circuit handled \nits petitions for review months before the D.C. Circuit \nadjudicated its bundle of consolidated cases.\nEPA is wrong to assert that venue lies exclusively in \nthe D.C. Circuit for every petitioner seeking appeal of an \nSRE hardship petition ruling. EPA is wrong about the \nfuel market: fuel prices are local and regional rather than \nnational. And EPA is wrong about the process here. Venue \nshould not shift to the D.C. Circuit merely because EPA \nbundled quintessentially local SRE hardship petitions \ntogether.\n\n6\nARGUMENT\n1.\t CountryMark\u2019s local market conditions dictate \nwhether it can meet the federal renewable fuels \nmandate.\nThe individualized nature of SRE hardship petitions \nmakes regional circuits the \u201cappropriate circuit[s]\u201d \nunder the CAA\u2019s venue provision, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07607(b)(1). \nIndiana-based CountryMark\u2019s SRE petitions should be \nreviewed in the Seventh Circuit. Sending them to the \nD.C. Circuit undermines the statutory framework of the \nCAA. This brief focuses on the practical effects that the \nvenue decision has on a small refinery like CountryMark.\nCountryMark is a quintessential small refinery. It \nis a farmer-owned cooperative that was advancing the \nuse of renewable fuels even before it was subject to a \nfederal law mandate. However, it faces disproportionate \neconomic hardship compared to other refineries\u2014even \nother small refineries\u2014because of circumstances specific \nto its ownership and marketplace.\nCountryMark has invested in fuel blending \ninfrastructure that remains capable of blending enough \nrenewable fuels to meet its annual obligation. But despite \nCountryMark\u2019s infrastructure and a customer base that \nembraced renewable fuels early, CountryMark\u2019s customers \nsimply do not want\u2014and thus will not purchase\u2014the \nhigher renewable fuel blends required for CountryMark\u2019s \ncompliance with EPA mandates.\nCustomers select the percentage of renewable fuels to \nbe blended into their gasoline and diesel when they choose \nwhich fuel mix to purchase. The customer\u2019s preferences \n\n7\nin CountryMark\u2019s market are specific to CountryMark \nand are not \u201cnational\u201d in any sense. In CountryMark\u2019s \nmarketplace, demand remains low for higher blends. \nFor example, E85 (a fuel product typically containing \n85% ethanol and 15% gasoline) is not widely accepted by \nCountryMark\u2019s consumers regardless of price because it \nhas less energy per gallon compared to E10 (10% ethanol; \n90% gasoline).2 That low demand is essentially immune \nto price changes. These local retail economics impact \nCountryMark\u2019s ability to sell fuel blends in sufficient \nquantities to achieve CountryMark\u2019s RVO compliance \nlevels.\nCountryMark\u2019s blend percentages are below the \nfederal government\u2019s CAA mandate because of its \ncustomers\u2019 preferences. They purchase less of the \nhigher fuel blends, resulting in CountryMark\u2019s achieving \nlower blending percentages than the mandate requires. \nCountryMark must then purchase RINs (compliance \ncredits) to achieve RFS compliance. The combination \nof mandated RVO increases above CountryMark\u2019s \nmarketplace\u2019s demand, plus increasing RIN prices, makes \ncontinued compliance practically impossible, and SREs \nvital. Without SREs, CountryMark\u2019s long-term viability \nis threatened.\nAnother economic circumstance specific to \nCountryMark is its disproportionate blending of diesel \n2.\u2002 Ethanol, U.S. Dep\u2019t of Energy, https://www.fueleconomy.\ngov/feg/ethanol.shtml (last visited Jan. 27, 2025) (\u201cDue to ethanol\u2019s \nlower energy content, [flex fuel vehicles] operating on E85 get \nroughly 15% to 27% fewer miles per gallon than when operating \non regular gasoline, depending on the ethanol content. Regular \ngasoline typically contains about 10% ethanol.\u201d).\n\n8\nversus gasoline. CountryMark first blended biodiesel \nin 2006, and it is today considered a leader of biodiesel \nblending in Indiana.3 Unsurprisingly, its farmer members \nand their rural customers require more diesel fuel than \ngasoline.\nCountryMark consequently operates its refinery to \nmaximize diesel fuel production to meet the requirements \nof its diesel-centric farmer members and customers. \nBecause of CountryMark\u2019s local customer demand, \nCountryMark sells more diesel fuel through its member \nretail network than it can produce at its refinery, so it must \npurchase diesel from other suppliers to meet customer \ndemand.\nEven though biodiesel helps meet this demand, \ncustomers strongly disfavor it, and therefore buy much \nless of it. This results in a disproportionate economic \nhardship for CountryMark compared to other refiners. \nAnd to preclude all doubt, the Department of Energy \nhas recognized that high diesel production is a criteria \nfor disproportionate economic harm in its small refinery \nexemption study.4 This is exacerbated for CountryMark.\nCountryMark\u2019s customers are integrated with the \nagricultural community, and they are knowledgeable \nusers of renewable fuels\u2014both ethanol and biodiesel. \nImportantly, CountryMark\u2019s customers are aware \n3.\u2002 Meggie Foster, CountryMark Debuts New Brand, Re-\nenergized Vision, Farm World (Jun. 20, 2007), http://www.\nfarmworldonline.com/news/ArchiveArticle.asp?newsid=4377.\n4.\u2002 U.S. Dep\u2019t of Energy, Small Refinery Exemption Study: An \nInvestigation into Disproportionate Economic Hardship 33 (Mar. \n2011), https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-12/documents/\nsmall-refinery-exempt-study.pdf.\n\n9\nthat biodiesel does not work well in cold temperatures, \nfor which Indiana winters are well known. This is an \nacute concern for agricultural consumers because \nthey frequently store diesel fuel on-site, year-round. \nConsequently, CountryMark can sell less than 2% of \nbiodiesel on an annual average basis as a percentage of \nall diesel sales. Contrast this with non-obligated parties \nlike large truck stops who sell to on-road truckers. Truck \nstops can routinely blend 20% biodiesel in their product \nbecause on-road truckers immediately consume the fuel, \nand thus do not have to worry about exposing that diesel \nfuel to the elements in longer-term storage.\nThese local marketplace factors preclude \nCountryMark\u2019s opportunity to blend biodiesel into diesel \nfuel, as compared to blending ethanol into gasoline. \nEven if CountryMark were to try to force a 5% biodiesel \nblend on customers, that would not be enough to meet \nCountryMark\u2019s RFS obligations. Since higher biodiesel \nblends are not as accepted in the market, CountryMark \ndoes not sell as many biodiesel blends at 10% or higher.\nWithout having the ability to sell higher renewable \nblends in diesel fuel, CountryMark is structurally \ndisadvantaged compared to other refineries. By favoring \nthe production of diesel fuel to meet the needs of its \nregional agricultural market, CountryMark does not \nproduce enough gasoline for ethanol blending at any \npercentage that would eliminate the need to purchase \nhigh-priced RINs.\nCountryMark operates in a volatile fuel market and \nits disproportionate economic hardship is structural. \nCountryMark produces more diesel fuel than a typical \n\n10\nrefinery to serve its farmer-owners, and it is located in \nan extremely competitive market with multiple refineries, \npipelines, and terminals. \nAs a result, EPA needs to reevaluate each year whether \nthe exemption should be extended to CountryMark, \njust as Congress directed. When EPA gets the SRE \ndetermination wrong, CountryMark should be heard \nindividually, not bundled with other geographically \ndispersed SRE petitioners. And its statutory venue is the \nSeventh Circuit, its regional court of appeals.\n2.\t CountryMark lost its opportunity for individualized \njudicial review of the denial of its SRE hardship \npetition.\nCountryMark filed a petition for review of EPA\u2019s denial \nof its hardship petition for 2018 in the Seventh Circuit in \nMay 2022.5 In this petition, CountryMark sought to bring \nbefore its regional circuit its unique and local economic \nfactors. Instead of consideration by the Seventh Circuit \nof these CountryMark-centric economics factors, the case \nwas transferred to the D.C. Circuit on EPA\u2019s motion.6\nCountryMark also filed a petition for review of EPA\u2019s \ndenial of its hardship petitions for 2019, 2020, and 2021 \nin the Seventh Circuit in August 2022.7 As with the May \n5.\u2002 See Petition for Review, Countrymark Refin. and Logistics, \nLLC v. EPA, No. 22-1878 (7th Cir. May 18, 2022).\n6.\u2002 See Order Granting EPA\u2019s Motion to Transfer, Countrymark \nRefin. and Logistics, LLC v. EPA, No. 22-1878 (7th Cir. Jul. 20, \n2022); Countrymark Refin. and Logistics, LLC v. EPA, No. 22-\n1165 (D.C. Cir.).\n7.\u2002 See Petition for Review, Countrymark Refin. and Logistics, \nLLC v. EPA, No. 22-2368 (7th Cir. Aug. 3, 2022).\n\n11\npetition for review, the August petition was transferred \nto the D.C. Circuit on EPA\u2019s motion.8 CountryMark\u2019s \npetitions for review were consolidated with 25 other small \nrefineries into an omnibus case in the D.C. Circuit. See \nSinclair Wyoming Refin. Co. LLC, et al. v. EPA, No. 22-\n1073 (D.C. Cir.).\nIn the small refinery petitioners\u2019 joint opening brief \nin Sinclair Wyoming, CountryMark\u2019s unique economic \ncircumstances got two sentences\u2014just 60 words in an \nopening brief of 23,970 words.9 And in the joint reply brief \nthere was no room to mention CountryMark\u2019s specific, \nlocal economics at all.10 Owing to the consolidated nature \nof the case, CountryMark could spend just two sentences \nexplaining why millions of dollars of compliance costs \nunder the RFS created disproportionate hardship for \nCountryMark and threatened its continued financial \nviability.\nIt is hard to see how CountryMark\u2019s appeal could \nreceive the individualized attention it is entitled to \nwithin just 0.025% of the opening brief\u2014and none of \nthe reply. If CountryMark had remained in the Seventh \n8.\u2002 See Order Granting EPA\u2019s Motion to Transfer, Countrymark \nRefin. and Logistics, LLC v. EPA, No. 22-2368 (7th Cir. Sep. 8, \n2022); Countrymark Refin. and Logistics, LLC v. EPA, No. 22-\n1238 (D.C. Cir.).\n9.\u2002 See Final Joint Opening Brief of Petitioner-Appellants at \n17, 81, Sinclair Wyoming Refin. Co. LLC, et al. v. EPA, No. 22-\n1073 (D.C. Cir., Jun. 15, 2023).\n10.\u2002 See generally Final Joint Reply Brief of Petitioner-\nAppellants, Sinclair Wyoming Refin. Co. LLC, et al. v. EPA, No. \n22-1073 (D.C. Cir., Jan. 9, 2024).\n\n12\nCircuit, it would have had 14,000 words in the opening \nbrief\u2014and 7,000 in the reply\u2014to discuss its individual \neconomic reality and its disproportionate hardship \nunder the RFS.11 If CountryMark\u2019s case had remained \nin the Seventh Circuit, it would have had that court\u2019s full \nattention. CountryMark would have been able to explain \nits particular operations, customers, and market factors. \nIts hardships would have been fully and fairly considered \nby judges in CountryMark\u2019s regional circuit, as Congress \nintended.\n3.\t CountryMark lost its opportunity for timely \njudicial review of the denial of its SRE hardship \npetition.\nCongress recognized that the CAA\u2019s fuel mandates \ncould pose an existential threat to smaller refineries, hence \nthe exemption system for refiners facing \u201cdisproportionate \nhardship.\u201d A smaller refinery facing this existential threat \nneeds timely review of its SRE hardship petition. So the \nCAA directs EPA to act on an SRE hardship petition \nwithin 90 days of receipt. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07545(o)(9)(B)(iii). \nNeedless to say, if EPA denies a hardship petition, the \nsmall refinery also needs timely adjudication of its petition \nfor review of that decision; vindication delivered months, \nand in some cases, years, too late is small comfort.\nThe dozens of SRE petitioners, including CountryMark, \nwho were bundled together in the D.C. Circuit in Sinclair \nWyoming filed SRE hardship petitions as early as 2016, \nreceived denials from EPA in April and June 2022, and \nwere given judicial decisions in the D.C. Circuit in July \n11.\u2002 Seventh Circuit Local Rule 32(c).\n\n13\n2024. Sinclair Wyoming Refin. Co. LLC v. EPA, 114 F.4th \n696, 704 (D.C. Cir. 2024). That means that for more than \nhalf of the existence of the renewable fuel mandate, small \nrefineries like CountryMark have operated in regulatory \nuncertainty that threatened their very existence. See 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07545(o)(9)(A)(i) (directing that the renewable \nfuel mandate will apply to small refineries beginning in \n2011). It is true that much of the delay is attributable to \nEPA\u2019s failure to act on the petitions in a timely fashion.12 \nBut not all. \nVenue mattered. The Fifth Circuit declined to transfer \nits petitions to the D.C. Circuit. It resolved both the venue \ndispute and the merits of those petitions eight months \nbefore the D.C. Circuit adjudicated the dozens of petitions \nbundled together in the April and June 2022 denials. See \nCalumet Shreveport Refin., LLC v. EPA, 86 F.4th 1121 \n(5th Cir. 2023). The distributed workload designed by \nCongress is better suited for timely adjudication of SRE \nhardship petitions. Delayed decision-making leads to \ngreater economic uncertainty. Along with the threats of \nincreasing RVOs and rising RIN prices, delay undermines \nCountryMark\u2019s ability to plan for the future and maintain \nits economic viability for its 140,000 farmer-owners and \ntheir customers.\n12.\u2002 Respondents ably explain why EPA should not be allowed \nto use that unlawful delay to turn dozens of local decisions into \none or two \u201cnational\u201d ones. Respondents Br. 17, 25-26, 39-40 (Jan. \n21, 2025).\n\n14\nCONCLUSION\nCountryMark exemplifies the localized challenges \nfaced by small refineries. Its operations are deeply \nembedded in the region within which it operates. These \nunique regional dynamics are best understood and \nadjudicated within CountryMark\u2019s regional circuit.\nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s venue ruling should be upheld to \nensure that EPA\u2019s actions on SRE applicants\u2019 petitions \nare reviewed within the applicants\u2019 regional circuits. \nThis approach respects the individualized nature of SRE \ndeterminations, reinforces statutory compliance, and \npreserves the rights of small refineries like CountryMark \nto operate within a fair and sustainable regulatory \nframework.\nRespectfully submitted,\nJanuary 28, 2025\nAaron M.

CountryMark is \nowned by more than 140,000 farmers. It is headquartered \nin Indiana.\nCountryMark has a significant interest in this \nappeal because, while small refineries (rightly) prevailed \nin the recent Sinclair Wyoming decision in the D.C. \nCircuit, CountryMark did not get its own day in court \nto specifically and fully address the disproportionate \neconomic hardship that is suffers. CountryMark\u2019s case \nwas improperly consolidated with those of 25 other small \nrefineries. See Sinclair Wyoming Refin. Co. LLC v. EPA, \n101 F.4th 871 (D.C. Cir. 2024). As a result, CountryMark\u2019s \nparticular economic circumstances were mentioned in \njust two sentences in the briefs before the D.C. Circuit. It \nhad no chance to fully and fairly explain how denial of its \nhardship petitions could jeopardize its ability to continue \noperating.\nThe demise of CountryMark would significantly \nharm the rural region in which it operates. CountryMark \nemploys nearly 500 workers, concentrated in the rural \neconomy of southwest Indiana and southeast Illinois. \n1.\u2002 No counsel for a party authored this brief in whole or in \npart. No such counsel or a party made a monetary contribution \nintended to fund the preparation or submission of this brief. No \nperson other than the amicus curiae, its members, or its counsel, \nmade such a monetary contribution.\n\n2\nIn Posey County, Indiana, a county with only 25,000 \nresidents, CountryMark provides over $30 million in \nwages and benefits each year. In 2024, it purchased over \n$800 million of crude oil primarily from the Illinois Basin, \nand those purchases provided income to the 40,000 royalty \nowners in the Illinois Basin. Its products are also sold and \ndistributed through its branded dealer network, providing \nemployment throughout rural communities in its area.\nCountryMark is the only farmer-owned integrated \noil company in the United States, and it is recognized in \nIndiana as a leader in the distribution of biodiesel and \nethanol. Its refinery, which uses 100% American crude \noil, processes 35,000 barrels of crude per day. It supplies \nover 70% of agricultural market fuels and 50% of school \ndistrict fuels in Indiana. Although CountryMark is a \ncritical participant in its regional market, it operates as \na small refinery relative to its peers, with a capacity that \nis merely one-tenth the size of the average refinery in its \nregion.\nCountryMark is precisely the type of small refinery \nCongress envisioned when enacting Small Refinery \nExemptions (\u201cSRE\u201d). For CountryMark, SREs are not \na mechanism to avoid compliance with Congressional \nmandates; rather, they are vital tools to sustain economic \nviability while advancing renewable fuel adoption\u2014an \neffort CountryMark has championed since before such \nmandates existed.\nCountryMark is an Obligated Party under the \nRenewable Fuel Standard (\u201cRFS\u201d). Despite its early \nadoption of renewable fuels, CountryMark\u2019s customers \nare unable or unwilling to blend sufficient renewable \n\n3\nfuels to meet the company\u2019s annual RFS obligations. \nWhile CountryMark has invested significantly in blending \ninfrastructure, the continued escalation of Renewable \nVolume Obligations (\u201cRVOs\u201d), combined with rising \nRenewable Identification Number (\u201cRIN\u201d) prices, renders \ncompliance financially unsustainable without relief \nthrough SREs.\nTo address the economic hardship imposed by the \nRFS, CountryMark has sought SREs under the Clean \nAir Act (\u201cCAA\u201d). By statute, these exemptions must be \ndetermined based on the applicant\u2019s individual economic \ncircumstances. When the Environmental Protection \nAgency (\u201cEPA\u201d) denied CountryMark\u2019s RFS hardship \npetitions, CountryMark sought judicial review in its \nregional circuit. But, on EPA\u2019s motion, the cases were \ntransferred to the D.C. Circuit and consolidated with other \nrefineries\u2019 petitions, denying CountryMark its statutory \nright to review of its particular economic hardships by \nits regional circuit. CountryMark thus has significant \ninterest in this Court\u2019s affirmance of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \ndetermination that the proper venue for review of EPA\u2019s \ndecisions on SRE petitions is the small refinery\u2019s regional \ncircuit.\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\nThe Fifth Circuit correctly determined that the \nproper venue for judicial review of EPA\u2019s decision on \nSRE petitions is the regional circuit of the petitioning \nsmall refinery. The specific economic circumstances of \nthe small refinery and the area in which it operates are \nthe statutorily required and exclusive bases for EPA \ndeterminations of RFS hardship applications. A small \n\n4\nrefinery is almost by definition a local or regional concern. \nSee 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07545(o)(1)(K). Thus, the SRE applicant\u2019s \nregional circuit is best suited to address the application \nand the local economic realities that should underlie EPA\u2019s \ndecision.\nCongress concluded that localized EPA decisions \nshould be reviewed by local jurisdictions. 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a07607(b)(1). That is a rational division of labor for at least \nthree reasons.\nFirst, local jurisdictions are best equipped to render \ndecisions based on local economic realities. Indeed, in \nlarge measure, that is the very purpose of having regional \ncourts of appeals. EPA, along with supporting amici from \ntrade associations that represent non-obligated entities, \nwrongly assume that fuel prices are generally set in the \ncontext of a national market. All states and regions have \ndifferent fuel prices, which are driven by the supply and \ndemand in local markets. Anyone who travels regularly \ncan attest that fuel prices in Indiana, California, and \nLouisiana differ widely\u2014driven by local or regional supply \nand demand. Fuel prices in Posey County in southern \nIndiana are noticeably different from those of Chicago-\nadjacent Lake County, Indiana. CountryMark, which is an \nObligated Party, operates wholesale terminals in several \nmarkets and experiences these local economic differences \nevery day. This reinforces the need for review of EPA \ndecisions in the SRE applicant\u2019s regional circuit.\nSecond, distributing localized EPA actions among \nthe regional circuits ensures that petitioners get the \nindividualized review that the CAA contemplates. The \nCAA directs EPA to evaluate \u201ca\u201d hardship petition \nbased on whether the particular petitioner would face \n\n5\na \u201cdisproportionate economic hardship\u201d if required to \ncomply with renewable fuel standards. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07545(o)\n(9)(B)(i-ii). It naturally follows that the denial of an SRE \nhardship petition will also get individualized attention in \nthe appropriate court of appeals. But in the joint opening \nbrief in Sinclair Wyoming, CountryMark\u2019s unique \ncircumstances got just two sentences\u2014totaling 60 words. \nAnd CountryMark was not mentioned at all in the joint \nreply brief. CountryMark has a greater opportunity to \ndiscuss its economic hardship in this amicus brief than it \nhad to explain them in Sinclair Wyoming, where it was a \nparty and its own petition was reviewed.\nThird, individual petitioners are more likely to get \nthe timely review required by the CAA if the workload is \ndispersed among the regional circuits. The CAA directs \nEPA to act on an SRE hardship petition within 90 days \nof receipt. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07545(o)(9)(B)(iii). As Respondents \nexplain, EPA ignored that deadline and deprived many \nSRE petitioners of their right to timely review. See \nRespondents Br. 17, 25-26, 39-40 (Jan. 21, 2025). That \ndelay was exacerbated by the consolidation of dozens of \npetitions in the D.C. Circuit. The Fifth Circuit handled \nits petitions for review months before the D.C. Circuit \nadjudicated its bundle of consolidated cases.\nEPA is wrong to assert that venue lies exclusively in \nthe D.C. Circuit for every petitioner seeking appeal of an \nSRE hardship petition ruling. EPA is wrong about the \nfuel market: fuel prices are local and regional rather than \nnational. And EPA is wrong about the process here. Venue \nshould not shift to the D.C. Circuit merely because EPA \nbundled quintessentially local SRE hardship petitions \ntogether.\n\n6\nARGUMENT\n1.\t CountryMark\u2019s local market conditions dictate \nwhether it can meet the federal renewable fuels \nmandate.\nThe individualized nature of SRE hardship petitions \nmakes regional circuits the \u201cappropriate circuit[s]\u201d \nunder the CAA\u2019s venue provision, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07607(b)(1). \nIndiana-based CountryMark\u2019s SRE petitions should be \nreviewed in the Seventh Circuit. Sending them to the \nD.C. Circuit undermines the statutory framework of the \nCAA. This brief focuses on the practical effects that the \nvenue decision has on a small refinery like CountryMark.\nCountryMark is a quintessential small refinery. It \nis a farmer-owned cooperative that was advancing the \nuse of renewable fuels even before it was subject to a \nfederal law mandate. However, it faces disproportionate \neconomic hardship compared to other refineries\u2014even \nother small refineries\u2014because of circumstances specific \nto its ownership and marketplace.\nCountryMark has invested in fuel blending \ninfrastructure that remains capable of blending enough \nrenewable fuels to meet its annual obligation. But despite \nCountryMark\u2019s infrastructure and a customer base that \nembraced renewable fuels early, CountryMark\u2019s customers \nsimply do not want\u2014and thus will not purchase\u2014the \nhigher renewable fuel blends required for CountryMark\u2019s \ncompliance with EPA mandates.\nCustomers select the percentage of renewable fuels to \nbe blended into their gasoline and diesel when they choose \nwhich fuel mix to purchase. The customer\u2019s preferences \n\n7\nin CountryMark\u2019s market are specific to CountryMark \nand are not \u201cnational\u201d in any sense. In CountryMark\u2019s \nmarketplace, demand remains low for higher blends. \nFor example, E85 (a fuel product typically containing \n85% ethanol and 15% gasoline) is not widely accepted by \nCountryMark\u2019s consumers regardless of price because it \nhas less energy per gallon compared to E10 (10% ethanol; \n90% gasoline).2 That low demand is essentially immune \nto price changes. These local retail economics impact \nCountryMark\u2019s ability to sell fuel blends in sufficient \nquantities to achieve CountryMark\u2019s RVO compliance \nlevels.\nCountryMark\u2019s blend percentages are below the \nfederal government\u2019s CAA mandate because of its \ncustomers\u2019 preferences. They purchase less of the \nhigher fuel blends, resulting in CountryMark\u2019s achieving \nlower blending percentages than the mandate requires. \nCountryMark must then purchase RINs (compliance \ncredits) to achieve RFS compliance. The combination \nof mandated RVO increases above CountryMark\u2019s \nmarketplace\u2019s demand, plus increasing RIN prices, makes \ncontinued compliance practically impossible, and SREs \nvital. Without SREs, CountryMark\u2019s long-term viability \nis threatened.\nAnother economic circumstance specific to \nCountryMark is its disproportionate blending of diesel \n2.\u2002 Ethanol, U.S. Dep\u2019t of Energy, https://www.fueleconomy.\ngov/feg/ethanol.shtml (last visited Jan. 27, 2025) (\u201cDue to ethanol\u2019s \nlower energy content, [flex fuel vehicles] operating on E85 get \nroughly 15% to 27% fewer miles per gallon than when operating \non regular gasoline, depending on the ethanol content. Regular \ngasoline typically contains about 10% ethanol.\u201d).\n\n8\nversus gasoline. CountryMark first blended biodiesel \nin 2006, and it is today considered a leader of biodiesel \nblending in Indiana.3 Unsurprisingly, its farmer members \nand their rural customers require more diesel fuel than \ngasoline.\nCountryMark consequently operates its refinery to \nmaximize diesel fuel production to meet the requirements \nof its diesel-centric farmer members and customers. \nBecause of CountryMark\u2019s local customer demand, \nCountryMark sells more diesel fuel through its member \nretail network than it can produce at its refinery, so it must \npurchase diesel from other suppliers to meet customer \ndemand.\nEven though biodiesel helps meet this demand, \ncustomers strongly disfavor it, and therefore buy much \nless of it. This results in a disproportionate economic \nhardship for CountryMark compared to other refiners. \nAnd to preclude all doubt, the Department of Energy \nhas recognized that high diesel production is a criteria \nfor disproportionate economic harm in its small refinery \nexemption study.4 This is exacerbated for CountryMark.\nCountryMark\u2019s customers are integrated with the \nagricultural community, and they are knowledgeable \nusers of renewable fuels\u2014both ethanol and biodiesel. \nImportantly, CountryMark\u2019s customers are aware \n3.\u2002 Meggie Foster, CountryMark Debuts New Brand, Re-\nenergized Vision, Farm World (Jun. 20, 2007), http://www.\nfarmworldonline.com/news/ArchiveArticle.asp?newsid=4377.\n4.\u2002 U.S. Dep\u2019t of Energy, Small Refinery Exemption Study: An \nInvestigation into Disproportionate Economic Hardship 33 (Mar. \n2011), https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-12/documents/\nsmall-refinery-exempt-study.pdf.\n\n9\nthat biodiesel does not work well in cold temperatures, \nfor which Indiana winters are well known. This is an \nacute concern for agricultural consumers because \nthey frequently store diesel fuel on-site, year-round. \nConsequently, CountryMark can sell less than 2% of \nbiodiesel on an annual average basis as a percentage of \nall diesel sales. Contrast this with non-obligated parties \nlike large truck stops who sell to on-road truckers. Truck \nstops can routinely blend 20% biodiesel in their product \nbecause on-road truckers immediately consume the fuel, \nand thus do not have to worry about exposing that diesel \nfuel to the elements in longer-term storage.\nThese local marketplace factors preclude \nCountryMark\u2019s opportunity to blend biodiesel into diesel \nfuel, as compared to blending ethanol into gasoline. \nEven if CountryMark were to try to force a 5% biodiesel \nblend on customers, that would not be enough to meet \nCountryMark\u2019s RFS obligations. Since higher biodiesel \nblends are not as accepted in the market, CountryMark \ndoes not sell as many biodiesel blends at 10% or higher.\nWithout having the ability to sell higher renewable \nblends in diesel fuel, CountryMark is structurally \ndisadvantaged compared to other refineries. By favoring \nthe production of diesel fuel to meet the needs of its \nregional agricultural market, CountryMark does not \nproduce enough gasoline for ethanol blending at any \npercentage that would eliminate the need to purchase \nhigh-priced RINs.\nCountryMark operates in a volatile fuel market and \nits disproportionate economic hardship is structural. \nCountryMark produces more diesel fuel than a typical \n\n10\nrefinery to serve its farmer-owners, and it is located in \nan extremely competitive market with multiple refineries, \npipelines, and terminals. \nAs a result, EPA needs to reevaluate each year whether \nthe exemption should be extended to CountryMark, \njust as Congress directed. When EPA gets the SRE \ndetermination wrong, CountryMark should be heard \nindividually, not bundled with other geographically \ndispersed SRE petitioners. And its statutory venue is the \nSeventh Circuit, its regional court of appeals.\n2.\t CountryMark lost its opportunity for individualized \njudicial review of the denial of its SRE hardship \npetition.\nCountryMark filed a petition for review of EPA\u2019s denial \nof its hardship petition for 2018 in the Seventh Circuit in \nMay 2022.5 In this petition, CountryMark sought to bring \nbefore its regional circuit its unique and local economic \nfactors. Instead of consideration by the Seventh Circuit \nof these CountryMark-centric economics factors, the case \nwas transferred to the D.C. Circuit on EPA\u2019s motion.6\nCountryMark also filed a petition for review of EPA\u2019s \ndenial of its hardship petitions for 2019, 2020, and 2021 \nin the Seventh Circuit in August 2022.7 As with the May \n5.\u2002 See Petition for Review, Countrymark Refin. and Logistics, \nLLC v. EPA, No. 22-1878 (7th Cir. May 18, 2022).\n6.\u2002 See Order Granting EPA\u2019s Motion to Transfer, Countrymark \nRefin. and Logistics, LLC v. EPA, No. 22-1878 (7th Cir. Jul. 20, \n2022); Countrymark Refin. and Logistics, LLC v. EPA, No. 22-\n1165 (D.C. Cir.).\n7.\u2002 See Petition for Review, Countrymark Refin. and Logistics, \nLLC v. EPA, No. 22-2368 (7th Cir. Aug. 3, 2022).\n\n11\npetition for review, the August petition was transferred \nto the D.C. Circuit on EPA\u2019s motion.8 CountryMark\u2019s \npetitions for review were consolidated with 25 other small \nrefineries into an omnibus case in the D.C. Circuit. See \nSinclair Wyoming Refin. Co. LLC, et al. v. EPA, No. 22-\n1073 (D.C. Cir.).\nIn the small refinery petitioners\u2019 joint opening brief \nin Sinclair Wyoming, CountryMark\u2019s unique economic \ncircumstances got two sentences\u2014just 60 words in an \nopening brief of 23,970 words.9 And in the joint reply brief \nthere was no room to mention CountryMark\u2019s specific, \nlocal economics at all.10 Owing to the consolidated nature \nof the case, CountryMark could spend just two sentences \nexplaining why millions of dollars of compliance costs \nunder the RFS created disproportionate hardship for \nCountryMark and threatened its continued financial \nviability.\nIt is hard to see how CountryMark\u2019s appeal could \nreceive the individualized attention it is entitled to \nwithin just 0.025% of the opening brief\u2014and none of \nthe reply. If CountryMark had remained in the Seventh \n8.\u2002 See Order Granting EPA\u2019s Motion to Transfer, Countrymark \nRefin. and Logistics, LLC v. EPA, No. 22-2368 (7th Cir. Sep. 8, \n2022); Countrymark Refin. and Logistics, LLC v. EPA, No. 22-\n1238 (D.C. Cir.).\n9.\u2002 See Final Joint Opening Brief of Petitioner-Appellants at \n17, 81, Sinclair Wyoming Refin. Co. LLC, et al. v. EPA, No. 22-\n1073 (D.C. Cir., Jun. 15, 2023).\n10.\u2002 See generally Final Joint Reply Brief of Petitioner-\nAppellants, Sinclair Wyoming Refin. Co. LLC, et al. v. EPA, No. \n22-1073 (D.C. Cir., Jan. 9, 2024).\n\n12\nCircuit, it would have had 14,000 words in the opening \nbrief\u2014and 7,000 in the reply\u2014to discuss its individual \neconomic reality and its disproportionate hardship \nunder the RFS.11 If CountryMark\u2019s case had remained \nin the Seventh Circuit, it would have had that court\u2019s full \nattention. CountryMark would have been able to explain \nits particular operations, customers, and market factors. \nIts hardships would have been fully and fairly considered \nby judges in CountryMark\u2019s regional circuit, as Congress \nintended.\n3.\t CountryMark lost its opportunity for timely \njudicial review of the denial of its SRE hardship \npetition.\nCongress recognized that the CAA\u2019s fuel mandates \ncould pose an existential threat to smaller refineries, hence \nthe exemption system for refiners facing \u201cdisproportionate \nhardship.\u201d A smaller refinery facing this existential threat \nneeds timely review of its SRE hardship petition. So the \nCAA directs EPA to act on an SRE hardship petition \nwithin 90 days of receipt. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07545(o)(9)(B)(iii). \nNeedless to say, if EPA denies a hardship petition, the \nsmall refinery also needs timely adjudication of its petition \nfor review of that decision; vindication delivered months, \nand in some cases, years, too late is small comfort.\nThe dozens of SRE petitioners, including CountryMark, \nwho were bundled together in the D.C. Circuit in Sinclair \nWyoming filed SRE hardship petitions as early as 2016, \nreceived denials from EPA in April and June 2022, and \nwere given judicial decisions in the D.C. Circuit in July \n11.\u2002 Seventh Circuit Local Rule 32(c).\n\n13\n2024. Sinclair Wyoming Refin. Co. LLC v. EPA, 114 F.4th \n696, 704 (D.C. Cir. 2024). That means that for more than \nhalf of the existence of the renewable fuel mandate, small \nrefineries like CountryMark have operated in regulatory \nuncertainty that threatened their very existence. See 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07545(o)(9)(A)(i) (directing that the renewable \nfuel mandate will apply to small refineries beginning in \n2011). It is true that much of the delay is attributable to \nEPA\u2019s failure to act on the petitions in a timely fashion.12 \nBut not all. \nVenue mattered. The Fifth Circuit declined to transfer \nits petitions to the D.C. Circuit. It resolved both the venue \ndispute and the merits of those petitions eight months \nbefore the D.C. Circuit adjudicated the dozens of petitions \nbundled together in the April and June 2022 denials. See \nCalumet Shreveport Refin., LLC v. EPA, 86 F.4th 1121 \n(5th Cir. 2023). The distributed workload designed by \nCongress is better suited for timely adjudication of SRE \nhardship petitions. Delayed decision-making leads to \ngreater economic uncertainty. Along with the threats of \nincreasing RVOs and rising RIN prices, delay undermines \nCountryMark\u2019s ability to plan for the future and maintain \nits economic viability for its 140,000 farmer-owners and \ntheir customers.\n12.\u2002 Respondents ably explain why EPA should not be allowed \nto use that unlawful delay to turn dozens of local decisions into \none or two \u201cnational\u201d ones. Respondents Br. 17, 25-26, 39-40 (Jan. \n21, 2025).\n\n14\nCONCLUSION\nCountryMark exemplifies the localized challenges \nfaced by small refineries. Its operations are deeply \nembedded in the region within which it operates. These \nunique regional dynamics are best understood and \nadjudicated within CountryMark\u2019s regional circuit.\nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s venue ruling should be upheld to \nensure that EPA\u2019s actions on SRE applicants\u2019 petitions \nare reviewed within the applicants\u2019 regional circuits. \nThis approach respects the individualized nature of SRE \ndeterminations, reinforces s\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n48: 20250128133338281_23-122920Affidavit.json (score: 0.473)\nAFFIDAVIT OF SERVICE \n \nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES \n \nNo. 23-1229 \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------X \nENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY, \nPetitioner, \n \nv. \n \nCALUMET SHREVEPORT REFINING, L.L.C., ET AL., \nRespondents. \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------X \n \nSTATE OF NEW YORK  \n) \n \nCOUNTY OF NEW YORK \n) \n \nI, Julie Connor, being duly sworn according to law and being over the \nage of 18, upon my oath depose and say that: \n \nI am retained by Counsel of Record for Amicus Curiae. \n \nThat on the 28th day of January, 2025, I served the within Brief of \nCountrymark Refining and Logistics, LLC as Amicus Curiae  in Support of \nRespondent in the above-captioned matter upon: \n \nSarah M.

CountryMark is \nowned by more than 140,000 farmers. It is headquartered \nin Indiana.\nCountryMark has a significant interest in this \nappeal because, while small refineries (rightly) prevailed \nin the recent Sinclair Wyoming decision in the D.C. \nCircuit, CountryMark did not get its own day in court \nto specifically and fully address the disproportionate \neconomic hardship that is suffers. CountryMark\u2019s case \nwas improperly consolidated with those of 25 other small \nrefineries. See Sinclair Wyoming Refin. Co. LLC v. EPA, \n101 F.4th 871 (D.C. Cir. 2024). As a result, CountryMark\u2019s \nparticular economic circumstances were mentioned in \njust two sentences in the briefs before the D.C. Circuit. It \nhad no chance to fully and fairly explain how denial of its \nhardship petitions could jeopardize its ability to continue \noperating.\nThe demise of CountryMark would significantly \nharm the rural region in which it operates. CountryMark \nemploys nearly 500 workers, concentrated in the rural \neconomy of southwest Indiana and southeast Illinois. \n1.\u2002 No counsel for a party authored this brief in whole or in \npart. No such counsel or a party made a monetary contribution \nintended to fund the preparation or submission of this brief. No \nperson other than the amicus curiae, its members, or its counsel, \nmade such a monetary contribution.\n\n2\nIn Posey County, Indiana, a county with only 25,000 \nresidents, CountryMark provides over $30 million in \nwages and benefits each year. In 2024, it purchased over \n$800 million of crude oil primarily from the Illinois Basin, \nand those purchases provided income to the 40,000 royalty \nowners in the Illinois Basin. Its products are also sold and \ndistributed through its branded dealer network, providing \nemployment throughout rural communities in its area.\nCountryMark is the only farmer-owned integrated \noil company in the United States, and it is recognized in \nIndiana as a leader in the distribution of biodiesel and \nethanol. Its refinery, which uses 100% American crude \noil, processes 35,000 barrels of crude per day. It supplies \nover 70% of agricultural market fuels and 50% of school \ndistrict fuels in Indiana. Although CountryMark is a \ncritical participant in its regional market, it operates as \na small refinery relative to its peers, with a capacity that \nis merely one-tenth the size of the average refinery in its \nregion.\nCountryMark is precisely the type of small refinery \nCongress envisioned when enacting Small Refinery \nExemptions (\u201cSRE\u201d). For CountryMark, SREs are not \na mechanism to avoid compliance with Congressional \nmandates; rather, they are vital tools to sustain economic \nviability while advancing renewable fuel adoption\u2014an \neffort CountryMark has championed since before such \nmandates existed.\nCountryMark is an Obligated Party under the \nRenewable Fuel Standard (\u201cRFS\u201d). Despite its early \nadoption of renewable fuels, CountryMark\u2019s customers \nare unable or unwilling to blend sufficient renewable \n\n3\nfuels to meet the company\u2019s annual RFS obligations. \nWhile CountryMark has invested significantly in blending \ninfrastructure, the continued escalation of Renewable \nVolume Obligations (\u201cRVOs\u201d), combined with rising \nRenewable Identification Number (\u201cRIN\u201d) prices, renders \ncompliance financially unsustainable without relief \nthrough SREs.\nTo address the economic hardship imposed by the \nRFS, CountryMark has sought SREs under the Clean \nAir Act (\u201cCAA\u201d). By statute, these exemptions must be \ndetermined based on the applicant\u2019s individual economic \ncircumstances. When the Environmental Protection \nAgency (\u201cEPA\u201d) denied CountryMark\u2019s RFS hardship \npetitions, CountryMark sought judicial review in its \nregional circuit. But, on EPA\u2019s motion, the cases were \ntransferred to the D.C. Circuit and consolidated with other \nrefineries\u2019 petitions, denying CountryMark its statutory \nright to review of its particular economic hardships by \nits regional circuit. CountryMark thus has significant \ninterest in this Court\u2019s affirmance of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \ndetermination that the proper venue for review of EPA\u2019s \ndecisions on SRE petitions is the small refinery\u2019s regional \ncircuit.\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\nThe Fifth Circuit correctly determined that the \nproper venue for judicial review of EPA\u2019s decision on \nSRE petitions is the regional circuit of the petitioning \nsmall refinery. The specific economic circumstances of \nthe small refinery and the area in which it operates are \nthe statutorily required and exclusive bases for EPA \ndeterminations of RFS hardship applications. A small \n\n4\nrefinery is almost by definition a local or regional concern. \nSee 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07545(o)(1)(K). Thus, the SRE applicant\u2019s \nregional circuit is best suited to address the application \nand the local economic realities that should underlie EPA\u2019s \ndecision.\nCongress concluded that localized EPA decisions \nshould be reviewed by local jurisdictions. 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a07607(b)(1). That is a rational division of labor for at least \nthree reasons.\nFirst, local jurisdictions are best equipped to render \ndecisions based on local economic realities. Indeed, in \nlarge measure, that is the very purpose of having regional \ncourts of appeals. EPA, along with supporting amici from \ntrade associations that represent non-obligated entities, \nwrongly assume that fuel prices are generally set in the \ncontext of a national market. All states and regions have \ndifferent fuel prices, which are driven by the supply and \ndemand in local markets. Anyone who travels regularly \ncan attest that fuel prices in Indiana, California, and \nLouisiana differ widely\u2014driven by local or regional supply \nand demand. Fuel prices in Posey County in southern \nIndiana are noticeably different from those of Chicago-\nadjacent Lake County, Indiana. CountryMark, which is an \nObligated Party, operates wholesale terminals in several \nmarkets and experiences these local economic differences \nevery day. This reinforces the need for review of EPA \ndecisions in the SRE applicant\u2019s regional circuit.\nSecond, distributing localized EPA actions among \nthe regional circuits ensures that petitioners get the \nindividualized review that the CAA contemplates. The \nCAA directs EPA to evaluate \u201ca\u201d hardship petition \nbased on whether the particular petitioner would face \n\n5\na \u201cdisproportionate economic hardship\u201d if required to \ncomply with renewable fuel standards. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07545(o)\n(9)(B)(i-ii). It naturally follows that the denial of an SRE \nhardship petition will also get individualized attention in \nthe appropriate court of appeals. But in the joint opening \nbrief in Sinclair Wyoming, CountryMark\u2019s unique \ncircumstances got just two sentences\u2014totaling 60 words. \nAnd CountryMark was not mentioned at all in the joint \nreply brief. CountryMark has a greater opportunity to \ndiscuss its economic hardship in this amicus brief than it \nhad to explain them in Sinclair Wyoming, where it was a \nparty and its own petition was reviewed.\nThird, individual petitioners are more likely to get \nthe timely review required by the CAA if the workload is \ndispersed among the regional circuits. The CAA directs \nEPA to act on an SRE hardship petition within 90 days \nof receipt. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07545(o)(9)(B)(iii). As Respondents \nexplain, EPA ignored that deadline and deprived many \nSRE petitioners of their right to timely review. See \nRespondents Br. 17, 25-26, 39-40 (Jan. 21, 2025). That \ndelay was exacerbated by the consolidation of dozens of \npetitions in the D.C. Circuit. The Fifth Circuit handled \nits petitions for review months before the D.C. Circuit \nadjudicated its bundle of consolidated cases.\nEPA is wrong to assert that venue lies exclusively in \nthe D.C. Circuit for every petitioner seeking appeal of an \nSRE hardship petition ruling. EPA is wrong about the \nfuel market: fuel prices are local and regional rather than \nnational. And EPA is wrong about the process here. Venue \nshould not shift to the D.C. Circuit merely because EPA \nbundled quintessentially local SRE hardship petitions \ntogether.\n\n6\nARGUMENT\n1.\t CountryMark\u2019s local market conditions dictate \nwhether it can meet the federal renewable fuels \nmandate.\nThe individualized nature of SRE hardship petitions \nmakes regional circuits the \u201cappropriate circuit[s]\u201d \nunder the CAA\u2019s venue provision, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07607(b)(1). \nIndiana-based CountryMark\u2019s SRE petitions should be \nreviewed in the Seventh Circuit. Sending them to the \nD.C. Circuit undermines the statutory framework of the \nCAA. This brief focuses on the practical effects that the \nvenue decision has on a small refinery like CountryMark.\nCountryMark is a quintessential small refinery. It \nis a farmer-owned cooperative that was advancing the \nuse of renewable fuels even before it was subject to a \nfederal law mandate. However, it faces disproportionate \neconomic hardship compared to other refineries\u2014even \nother small refineries\u2014because of circumstances specific \nto its ownership and marketplace.\nCountryMark has invested in fuel blending \ninfrastructure that remains capable of blending enough \nrenewable fuels to meet its annual obligation. But despite \nCountryMark\u2019s infrastructure and a customer base that \nembraced renewable fuels early, CountryMark\u2019s customers \nsimply do not want\u2014and thus will not purchase\u2014the \nhigher renewable fuel blends required for CountryMark\u2019s \ncompliance with EPA mandates.\nCustomers select the percentage of renewable fuels to \nbe blended into their gasoline and diesel when they choose \nwhich fuel mix to purchase. The customer\u2019s preferences \n\n7\nin CountryMark\u2019s market are specific to CountryMark \nand are not \u201cnational\u201d in any sense. In CountryMark\u2019s \nmarketplace, demand remains low for higher blends. \nFor example, E85 (a fuel product typically containing \n85% ethanol and 15% gasoline) is not widely accepted by \nCountryMark\u2019s consumers regardless of price because it \nhas less energy per gallon compared to E10 (10% ethanol; \n90% gasoline).2 That low demand is essentially immune \nto price changes. These local retail economics impact \nCountryMark\u2019s ability to sell fuel blends in sufficient \nquantities to achieve CountryMark\u2019s RVO compliance \nlevels.\nCountryMark\u2019s blend percentages are below the \nfederal government\u2019s CAA mandate because of its \ncustomers\u2019 preferences. They purchase less of the \nhigher fuel blends, resulting in CountryMark\u2019s achieving \nlower blending percentages than the mandate requires. \nCountryMark must then purchase RINs (compliance \ncredits) to achieve RFS compliance. The combination \nof mandated RVO increases above CountryMark\u2019s \nmarketplace\u2019s demand, plus increasing RIN prices, makes \ncontinued compliance practically impossible, and SREs \nvital. Without SREs, CountryMark\u2019s long-term viability \nis threatened.\nAnother economic circumstance specific to \nCountryMark is its disproportionate blending of diesel \n2.\u2002 Ethanol, U.S. Dep\u2019t of Energy, https://www.fueleconomy.\ngov/feg/ethanol.shtml (last visited Jan. 27, 2025) (\u201cDue to ethanol\u2019s \nlower energy content, [flex fuel vehicles] operating on E85 get \nroughly 15% to 27% fewer miles per gallon than when operating \non regular gasoline, depending on the ethanol content. Regular \ngasoline typically contains about 10% ethanol.\u201d).\n\n8\nversus gasoline. CountryMark first blended biodiesel \nin 2006, and it is today considered a leader of biodiesel \nblending in Indiana.3 Unsurprisingly, its farmer members \nand their rural customers require more diesel fuel than \ngasoline.\nCountryMark consequently operates its refinery to \nmaximize diesel fuel production to meet the requirements \nof its diesel-centric farmer members and customers. \nBecause of CountryMark\u2019s local customer demand, \nCountryMark sells more diesel fuel through its member \nretail network than it can produce at its refinery, so it must \npurchase diesel from other suppliers to meet customer \ndemand.\nEven though biodiesel helps meet this demand, \ncustomers strongly disfavor it, and therefore buy much \nless of it. This results in a disproportionate economic \nhardship for CountryMark compared to other refiners. \nAnd to preclude all doubt, the Department of Energy \nhas recognized that high diesel production is a criteria \nfor disproportionate economic harm in its small refinery \nexemption study.4 This is exacerbated for CountryMark.\nCountryMark\u2019s customers are integrated with the \nagricultural community, and they are knowledgeable \nusers of renewable fuels\u2014both ethanol and biodiesel. \nImportantly, CountryMark\u2019s customers are aware \n3.\u2002 Meggie Foster, CountryMark Debuts New Brand, Re-\nenergized Vision, Farm World (Jun. 20, 2007), http://www.\nfarmworldonline.com/news/ArchiveArticle.asp?newsid=4377.\n4.\u2002 U.S. Dep\u2019t of Energy, Small Refinery Exemption Study: An \nInvestigation into Disproportionate Economic Hardship 33 (Mar. \n2011), https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-12/documents/\nsmall-refinery-exempt-study.pdf.\n\n9\nthat biodiesel does not work well in cold temperatures, \nfor which Indiana winters are well known. This is an \nacute concern for agricultural consumers because \nthey frequently store diesel fuel on-site, year-round. \nConsequently, CountryMark can sell less than 2% of \nbiodiesel on an annual average basis as a percentage of \nall diesel sales. Contrast this with non-obligated parties \nlike large truck stops who sell to on-road truckers. Truck \nstops can routinely blend 20% biodiesel in their product \nbecause on-road truckers immediately consume the fuel, \nand thus do not have to worry about exposing that diesel \nfuel to the elements in longer-term storage.\nThese local marketplace factors preclude \nCountryMark\u2019s opportunity to blend biodiesel into diesel \nfuel, as compared to blending ethanol into gasoline. \nEven if CountryMark were to try to force a 5% biodiesel \nblend on customers, that would not be enough to meet \nCountryMark\u2019s RFS obligations. Since higher biodiesel \nblends are not as accepted in the market, CountryMark \ndoes not sell as many biodiesel blends at 10% or higher.\nWithout having the ability to sell higher renewable \nblends in diesel fuel, CountryMark is structurally \ndisadvantaged compared to other refineries. By favoring \nthe production of diesel fuel to meet the needs of its \nregional agricultural market, CountryMark does not \nproduce enough gasoline for ethanol blending at any \npercentage that would eliminate the need to purchase \nhigh-priced RINs.\nCountryMark operates in a volatile fuel market and \nits disproportionate economic hardship is structural. \nCountryMark produces more diesel fuel than a typical \n\n10\nrefinery to serve its farmer-owners, and it is located in \nan extremely competitive market with multiple refineries, \npipelines, and terminals. \nAs a result, EPA needs to reevaluate each year whether \nthe exemption should be extended to CountryMark, \njust as Congress directed. When EPA gets the SRE \ndetermination wrong, CountryMark should be heard \nindividually, not bundled with other geographically \ndispersed SRE petitioners. And its statutory venue is the \nSeventh Circuit, its regional court of appeals.\n2.\t CountryMark lost its opportunity for individualized \njudicial review of the denial of its SRE hardship \npetition.\nCountryMark filed a petition for review of EPA\u2019s denial \nof its hardship petition for 2018 in the Seventh Circuit in \nMay 2022.5 In this petition, CountryMark sought to bring \nbefore its regional circuit its unique and local economic \nfactors. Instead of consideration by the Seventh Circuit \nof these CountryMark-centric economics factors, the case \nwas transferred to the D.C. Circuit on EPA\u2019s motion.6\nCountryMark also filed a petition for review of EPA\u2019s \ndenial of its hardship petitions for 2019, 2020, and 2021 \nin the Seventh Circuit in August 2022.7 As with the May \n5.\u2002 See Petition for Review, Countrymark Refin. and Logistics, \nLLC v. EPA, No. 22-1878 (7th Cir. May 18, 2022).\n6.\u2002 See Order Granting EPA\u2019s Motion to Transfer, Countrymark \nRefin. and Logistics, LLC v. EPA, No. 22-1878 (7th Cir.

Aug. 3, 2022).\n\n11\npetition for review, the August petition was transferred \nto the D.C. Circuit on EPA\u2019s motion.8 CountryMark\u2019s \npetitions for review were consolidated with 25 other small \nrefineries into an omnibus case in the D.C. Circuit. See \nSinclair Wyoming Refin. Co. LLC, et al. v. EPA, No. 22-\n1073 (D.C. Cir.).\nIn the small refinery petitioners\u2019 joint opening brief \nin Sinclair Wyoming, CountryMark\u2019s unique economic \ncircumstances got two sentences\u2014just 60 words in an \nopening brief of 23,970 words.9 And in the joint reply brief \nthere was no room to mention CountryMark\u2019s specific, \nlocal economics at all.10 Owing to the consolidated nature \nof the case, CountryMark could spend just two sentences \nexplaining why millions of dollars of compliance costs \nunder the RFS created disproportionate hardship for \nCountryMark and threatened its continued financial \nviability.\nIt is hard to see how CountryMark\u2019s appeal could \nreceive the individualized attention it is entitled to \nwithin just 0.025% of the opening brief\u2014and none of \nthe reply. If CountryMark had remained in the Seventh \n8.\u2002 See Order Granting EPA\u2019s Motion to Transfer, Countrymark \nRefin. and Logistics, LLC v. EPA, No. 22-2368 (7th Cir.

CountryMark would have been able to explain \nits particular operations, customers, and market factors. \nIts hardships would have been fully and fairly considered \nby judges in CountryMark\u2019s regional circuit, as Congress \nintended.\n3.\t CountryMark lost its opportunity for timely \njudicial review of the denial of its SRE hardship \npetition.\nCongress recognized that the CAA\u2019s fuel mandates \ncould pose an existential threat to smaller refineries, hence \nthe exemption system for refiners facing \u201cdisproportionate \nhardship.\u201d A smaller refinery facing this existential threat \nneeds timely review of its SRE hardship petition. So the \nCAA directs EPA to act on an SRE hardship petition \nwithin 90 days of receipt. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07545(o)(9)(B)(iii). \nNeedless to say, if EPA denies a hardship petition, the \nsmall refinery also needs timely adjudication of its petition \nfor review of that decision; vindication delivered months, \nand in some cases, years, too late is small comfort.\nThe dozens of SRE petitioners, including CountryMark, \nwho were bundled together in the D.C. Circuit in Sinclair \nWyoming filed SRE hardship petitions as early as 2016, \nreceived denials from EPA in April and June 2022, and \nwere given judicial decisions in the D.C. Circuit in July \n11.\u2002 Seventh Circuit Local Rule 32(c).\n\n13\n2024. Sinclair Wyoming Refin. Co. LLC v. EPA, 114 F.4th \n696, 704 (D.C. Cir. 2024). That means that for more than \nhalf of the existence of the renewable fuel mandate, small \nrefineries like CountryMark have operated in regulatory \nuncertainty that threatened their very existence. See 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07545(o)(9)(A)(i) (directing that the renewable \nfuel mandate will apply to small refineries beginning in \n2011). It is true that much of the delay is attributable to \nEPA\u2019s failure to act on the petitions in a timely fashion.12 \nBut not all. \nVenue mattered. The Fifth Circuit declined to transfer \nits petitions to the D.C. Circuit. It resolved both the venue \ndispute and the merits of those petitions eight months \nbefore the D.C. Circuit adjudicated the dozens of petitions \nbundled together in the April and June 2022 denials. See \nCalumet Shreveport Refin., LLC v. EPA, 86 F.4th 1121 \n(5th Cir. 2023). The distributed workload designed by \nCongress is better suited for timely adjudication of SRE \nhardship petitions. Delayed decision-making leads to \ngreater economic uncertainty. Along with the threats of \nincreasing RVOs and rising RIN prices, delay undermines \nCountryMark\u2019s ability to plan for the future and maintain \nits economic viability for its 140,000 farmer-owners and \ntheir customers.\n12.\u2002 Respondents ably explain why EPA should not be allowed \nto use that unlawful delay to turn dozens of local decisions into \none or two \u201cnational\u201d ones. Respondents Br. 17, 25-26, 39-40 (Jan. \n21, 2025).\n\n14\nCONCLUSION\nCountryMark exemplifies the localized challenges \nfaced by small refineries. Its operations are deeply \nembedded in the region within which it operates. These \nunique regional dynamics are best understood and \nadjudicated within CountryMark\u2019s regional circuit.\nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s venue ruling should be upheld to \nensure that EPA\u2019s actions on SRE applicants\u2019 petitions \nare reviewed within the applicants\u2019 regional circuits. \nThis approach respects the individualized nature of SRE \ndeterminations, reinforces statutory compliance, and \npreserves the rights of small refineries like CountryMark \nto operate within a fair and sustainable regulatory \nframework.\nRespectfully submitted,\nJanuary 28, 2025\nAaron M.

Circuit, likely focusing on the need for national uniformity in a national program. These arguments directly address the core legal question and will almost certainly be considered by the Justices. Understanding the breadth and nature of support for the petitioner's position is essential for an accurate prediction. Therefore, the Task EIG is high. The Design EIG is moderate. While analyzing amicus briefs is a standard part of SCOTUS prediction, this action helps refine the strategy by demonstrating the specific types of arguments (e.g., judicial administration, program uniformity) that are most salient in amicus briefs for procedural and jurisdictional cases. This provides a useful data point for how to weigh amicus arguments in future cases of this nature.",

CountryMark is \nowned by more than 140,000 farmers. It is headquartered \nin Indiana.\nCountryMark has a significant interest in this \nappeal because, while small refineries (rightly) prevailed \nin the recent Sinclair Wyoming decision in the D.C. \nCircuit, CountryMark did not get its own day in court \nto specifically and fully address the disproportionate \neconomic hardship that is suffers. CountryMark\u2019s case \nwas improperly consolidated with those of 25 other small \nrefineries. See Sinclair Wyoming Refin. Co. LLC v. EPA, \n101 F.4th 871 (D.C. Cir. 2024). As a result, CountryMark\u2019s \nparticular economic circumstances were mentioned in \njust two sentences in the briefs before the D.C. Circuit. It \nhad no chance to fully and fairly explain how denial of its \nhardship petitions could jeopardize its ability to continue \noperating.\nThe demise of CountryMark would significantly \nharm the rural region in which it operates. CountryMark \nemploys nearly 500 workers, concentrated in the rural \neconomy of southwest Indiana and southeast Illinois. \n1.\u2002 No counsel for a party authored this brief in whole or in \npart. No such counsel or a party made a monetary contribution \nintended to fund the preparation or submission of this brief. No \nperson other than the amicus curiae, its members, or its counsel, \nmade such a monetary contribution.\n\n2\nIn Posey County, Indiana, a county with only 25,000 \nresidents, CountryMark provides over $30 million in \nwages and benefits each year. In 2024, it purchased over \n$800 million of crude oil primarily from the Illinois Basin, \nand those purchases provided income to the 40,000 royalty \nowners in the Illinois Basin. Its products are also sold and \ndistributed through its branded dealer network, providing \nemployment throughout rural communities in its area.\nCountryMark is the only farmer-owned integrated \noil company in the United States, and it is recognized in \nIndiana as a leader in the distribution of biodiesel and \nethanol. Its refinery, which uses 100% American crude \noil, processes 35,000 barrels of crude per day. It supplies \nover 70% of agricultural market fuels and 50% of school \ndistrict fuels in Indiana. Although CountryMark is a \ncritical participant in its regional market, it operates as \na small refinery relative to its peers, with a capacity that \nis merely one-tenth the size of the average refinery in its \nregion.\nCountryMark is precisely the type of small refinery \nCongress envisioned when enacting Small Refinery \nExemptions (\u201cSRE\u201d). For CountryMark, SREs are not \na mechanism to avoid compliance with Congressional \nmandates; rather, they are vital tools to sustain economic \nviability while advancing renewable fuel adoption\u2014an \neffort CountryMark has championed since before such \nmandates existed.\nCountryMark is an Obligated Party under the \nRenewable Fuel Standard (\u201cRFS\u201d). Despite its early \nadoption of renewable fuels, CountryMark\u2019s customers \nare unable or unwilling to blend sufficient renewable \n\n3\nfuels to meet the company\u2019s annual RFS obligations. \nWhile CountryMark has invested significantly in blending \ninfrastructure, the continued escalation of Renewable \nVolume Obligations (\u201cRVOs\u201d), combined with rising \nRenewable Identification Number (\u201cRIN\u201d) prices, renders \ncompliance financially unsustainable without relief \nthrough SREs.\nTo address the economic hardship imposed by the \nRFS, CountryMark has sought SREs under the Clean \nAir Act (\u201cCAA\u201d). By statute, these exemptions must be \ndetermined based on the applicant\u2019s individual economic \ncircumstances. When the Environmental Protection \nAgency (\u201cEPA\u201d) denied CountryMark\u2019s RFS hardship \npetitions, CountryMark sought judicial review in its \nregional circuit. But, on EPA\u2019s motion, the cases were \ntransferred to the D.C. Circuit and consolidated with other \nrefineries\u2019 petitions, denying CountryMark its statutory \nright to review of its particular economic hardships by \nits regional circuit. CountryMark thus has significant \ninterest in this Court\u2019s affirmance of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \ndetermination that the proper venue for review of EPA\u2019s \ndecisions on SRE petitions is the small refinery\u2019s regional \ncircuit.\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\nThe Fifth Circuit correctly determined that the \nproper venue for judicial review of EPA\u2019s decision on \nSRE petitions is the regional circuit of the petitioning \nsmall refinery. The specific economic circumstances of \nthe small refinery and the area in which it operates are \nthe statutorily required and exclusive bases for EPA \ndeterminations of RFS hardship applications. A small \n\n4\nrefinery is almost by definition a local or regional concern. \nSee 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07545(o)(1)(K). Thus, the SRE applicant\u2019s \nregional circuit is best suited to address the application \nand the local economic realities that should underlie EPA\u2019s \ndecision.\nCongress concluded that localized EPA decisions \nshould be reviewed by local jurisdictions. 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a07607(b)(1). That is a rational division of labor for at least \nthree reasons.\nFirst, local jurisdictions are best equipped to render \ndecisions based on local economic realities. Indeed, in \nlarge measure, that is the very purpose of having regional \ncourts of appeals. EPA, along with supporting amici from \ntrade associations that represent non-obligated entities, \nwrongly assume that fuel prices are generally set in the \ncontext of a national market. All states and regions have \ndifferent fuel prices, which are driven by the supply and \ndemand in local markets. Anyone who travels regularly \ncan attest that fuel prices in Indiana, California, and \nLouisiana differ widely\u2014driven by local or regional supply \nand demand. Fuel prices in Posey County in southern \nIndiana are noticeably different from those of Chicago-\nadjacent Lake County, Indiana. CountryMark, which is an \nObligated Party, operates wholesale terminals in several \nmarkets and experiences these local economic differences \nevery day. This reinforces the need for review of EPA \ndecisions in the SRE applicant\u2019s regional circuit.\nSecond, distributing localized EPA actions among \nthe regional circuits ensures that petitioners get the \nindividualized review that the CAA contemplates. The \nCAA directs EPA to evaluate \u201ca\u201d hardship petition \nbased on whether the particular petitioner would face \n\n5\na \u201cdisproportionate economic hardship\u201d if required to \ncomply with renewable fuel standards. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07545(o)\n(9)(B)(i-ii). It naturally follows that the denial of an SRE \nhardship petition will also get individualized attention in \nthe appropriate court of appeals. But in the joint opening \nbrief in Sinclair Wyoming, CountryMark\u2019s unique \ncircumstances got just two sentences\u2014totaling 60 words. \nAnd CountryMark was not mentioned at all in the joint \nreply brief. CountryMark has a greater opportunity to \ndiscuss its economic hardship in this amicus brief than it \nhad to explain them in Sinclair Wyoming, where it was a \nparty and its own petition was reviewed.\nThird, individual petitioners are more likely to get \nthe timely review required by the CAA if the workload is \ndispersed among the regional circuits. The CAA directs \nEPA to act on an SRE hardship petition within 90 days \nof receipt. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07545(o)(9)(B)(iii). As Respondents \nexplain, EPA ignored that deadline and deprived many \nSRE petitioners of their right to timely review. See \nRespondents Br. 17, 25-26, 39-40 (Jan. 21, 2025). That \ndelay was exacerbated by the consolidation of dozens of \npetitions in the D.C. Circuit. The Fifth Circuit handled \nits petitions for review months before the D.C. Circuit \nadjudicated its bundle of consolidated cases.\nEPA is wrong to assert that venue lies exclusively in \nthe D.C. Circuit for every petitioner seeking appeal of an \nSRE hardship petition ruling. EPA is wrong about the \nfuel market: fuel prices are local and regional rather than \nnational. And EPA is wrong about the process here. Venue \nshould not shift to the D.C. Circuit merely because EPA \nbundled quintessentially local SRE hardship petitions \ntogether.\n\n6\nARGUMENT\n1.\t CountryMark\u2019s local market conditions dictate \nwhether it can meet the federal renewable fuels \nmandate.\nThe individualized nature of SRE hardship petitions \nmakes regional circuits the \u201cappropriate circuit[s]\u201d \nunder the CAA\u2019s venue provision, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07607(b)(1). \nIndiana-based CountryMark\u2019s SRE petitions should be \nreviewed in the Seventh Circuit. Sending them to the \nD.C. Circuit undermines the statutory framework of the \nCAA. This brief focuses on the practical effects that the \nvenue decision has on a small refinery like CountryMark.\nCountryMark is a quintessential small refinery. It \nis a farmer-owned cooperative that was advancing the \nuse of renewable fuels even before it was subject to a \nfederal law mandate. However, it faces disproportionate \neconomic hardship compared to other refineries\u2014even \nother small refineries\u2014because of circumstances specific \nto its ownership and marketplace.\nCountryMark has invested in fuel blending \ninfrastructure that remains capable of blending enough \nrenewable fuels to meet its annual obligation. But despite \nCountryMark\u2019s infrastructure and a customer base that \nembraced renewable fuels early, CountryMark\u2019s customers \nsimply do not want\u2014and thus will not purchase\u2014the \nhigher renewable fuel blends required for CountryMark\u2019s \ncompliance with EPA mandates.\nCustomers select the percentage of renewable fuels to \nbe blended into their gasoline and diesel when they choose \nwhich fuel mix to purchase. The customer\u2019s preferences \n\n7\nin CountryMark\u2019s market are specific to CountryMark \nand are not \u201cnational\u201d in any sense. In CountryMark\u2019s \nmarketplace, demand remains low for higher blends. \nFor example, E85 (a fuel product typically containing \n85% ethanol and 15% gasoline) is not widely accepted by \nCountryMark\u2019s consumers regardless of price because it \nhas less energy per gallon compared to E10 (10% ethanol; \n90% gasoline).2 That low demand is essentially immune \nto price changes. These local retail economics impact \nCountryMark\u2019s ability to sell fuel blends in sufficient \nquantities to achieve CountryMark\u2019s RVO compliance \nlevels.\nCountryMark\u2019s blend percentages are below the \nfederal government\u2019s CAA mandate because of its \ncustomers\u2019 preferences. They purchase less of the \nhigher fuel blends, resulting in CountryMark\u2019s achieving \nlower blending percentages than the mandate requires. \nCountryMark must then purchase RINs (compliance \ncredits) to achieve RFS compliance. The combination \nof mandated RVO increases above CountryMark\u2019s \nmarketplace\u2019s demand, plus increasing RIN prices, makes \ncontinued compliance practically impossible, and SREs \nvital. Without SREs, CountryMark\u2019s long-term viability \nis threatened.\nAnother economic circumstance specific to \nCountryMark is its disproportionate blending of diesel \n2.\u2002 Ethanol, U.S. Dep\u2019t of Energy, https://www.fueleconomy.\ngov/feg/ethanol.shtml (last visited Jan. 27, 2025) (\u201cDue to ethanol\u2019s \nlower energy content, [flex fuel vehicles] operating on E85 get \nroughly 15% to 27% fewer miles per gallon than when operating \non regular gasoline, depending on the ethanol content. Regular \ngasoline typically contains about 10% ethanol.\u201d).\n\n8\nversus gasoline. CountryMark first blended biodiesel \nin 2006, and it is today considered a leader of biodiesel \nblending in Indiana.3 Unsurprisingly, its farmer members \nand their rural customers require more diesel fuel than \ngasoline.\nCountryMark consequently operates its refinery to \nmaximize diesel fuel production to meet the requirements \nof its diesel-centric farmer members and customers. \nBecause of CountryMark\u2019s local customer demand, \nCountryMark sells more diesel fuel through its member \nretail network than it can produce at its refinery, so it must \npurchase diesel from other suppliers to meet customer \ndemand.\nEven though biodiesel helps meet this demand, \ncustomers strongly disfavor it, and therefore buy much \nless of it. This results in a disproportionate economic \nhardship for CountryMark compared to other refiners. \nAnd to preclude all doubt, the Department of Energy \nhas recognized that high diesel production is a criteria \nfor disproportionate economic harm in its small refinery \nexemption study.4 This is exacerbated for CountryMark.\nCountryMark\u2019s customers are integrated with the \nagricultural community, and they are knowledgeable \nusers of renewable fuels\u2014both ethanol and biodiesel. \nImportantly, CountryMark\u2019s customers are aware \n3.\u2002 Meggie Foster, CountryMark Debuts New Brand, Re-\nenergized Vision, Farm World (Jun. 20, 2007), http://www.\nfarmworldonline.com/news/ArchiveArticle.asp?newsid=4377.\n4.\u2002 U.S. Dep\u2019t of Energy, Small Refinery Exemption Study: An \nInvestigation into Disproportionate Economic Hardship 33 (Mar. \n2011), https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-12/documents/\nsmall-refinery-exempt-study.pdf.\n\n9\nthat biodiesel does not work well in cold temperatures, \nfor which Indiana winters are well known. This is an \nacute concern for agricultural consumers because \nthey frequently store diesel fuel on-site, year-round. \nConsequently, CountryMark can sell less than 2% of \nbiodiesel on an annual average basis as a percentage of \nall diesel sales. Contrast this with non-obligated parties \nlike large truck stops who sell to on-road truckers. Truck \nstops can routinely blend 20% biodiesel in their product \nbecause on-road truckers immediately consume the fuel, \nand thus do not have to worry about exposing that diesel \nfuel to the elements in longer-term storage.\nThese local marketplace factors preclude \nCountryMark\u2019s opportunity to blend biodiesel into diesel \nfuel, as compared to blending ethanol into gasoline. \nEven if CountryMark were to try to force a 5% biodiesel \nblend on customers, that would not be enough to meet \nCountryMark\u2019s RFS obligations. Since higher biodiesel \nblends are not as accepted in the market, CountryMark \ndoes not sell as many biodiesel blends at 10% or higher.\nWithout having the ability to sell higher renewable \nblends in diesel fuel, CountryMark is structurally \ndisadvantaged compared to other refineries. By favoring \nthe production of diesel fuel to meet the needs of its \nregional agricultural market, CountryMark does not \nproduce enough gasoline for ethanol blending at any \npercentage that would eliminate the need to purchase \nhigh-priced RINs.\nCountryMark operates in a volatile fuel market and \nits disproportionate economic hardship is structural. \nCountryMark produces more diesel fuel than a typical \n\n10\nrefinery to serve its farmer-owners, and it is located in \nan extremely competitive market with multiple refineries, \npipelines, and terminals. \nAs a result, EPA needs to reevaluate each year whether \nthe exemption should be extended to CountryMark, \njust as Congress directed. When EPA gets the SRE \ndetermination wrong, CountryMark should be heard \nindividually, not bundled with other geographically \ndispersed SRE petitioners. And its statutory venue is the \nSeventh Circuit, its regional court of appeals.\n2.\t CountryMark lost its opportunity for individualized \njudicial review of the denial of its SRE hardship \npetition.\nCountryMark filed a petition for review of EPA\u2019s denial \nof its hardship petition for 2018 in the Seventh Circuit in \nMay 2022.5 In this petition, CountryMark sought to bring \nbefore its regional circuit its unique and local economic \nfactors. Instead of consideration by the Seventh Circuit \nof these CountryMark-centric economics factors, the case \nwas transferred to the D.C. Circuit on EPA\u2019s motion.6\nCountryMark also filed a petition for review of EPA\u2019s \ndenial of its hardship petitions for 2019, 2020, and 2021 \nin the Seventh Circuit in August 2022.7 As with the May \n5.\u2002 See Petition for Review, Countrymark Refin. and Logistics, \nLLC v. EPA, No. 22-1878 (7th Cir. May 18, 2022).\n6.\u2002 See Order Granting EPA\u2019s Motion to Transfer, Countrymark \nRefin. and Logistics, LLC v. EPA, No. 22-1878 (7th Cir.

Aug. 3, 2022).\n\n11\npetition for review, the August petition was transferred \nto the D.C. Circuit on EPA\u2019s motion.8 CountryMark\u2019s \npetitions for review were consolidated with 25 other small \nrefineries into an omnibus case in the D.C. Circuit. See \nSinclair Wyoming Refin. Co. LLC, et al. v. EPA, No. 22-\n1073 (D.C. Cir.).\nIn the small refinery petitioners\u2019 joint opening brief \nin Sinclair Wyoming, CountryMark\u2019s unique economic \ncircumstances got two sentences\u2014just 60 words in an \nopening brief of 23,970 words.9 And in the joint reply brief \nthere was no room to mention CountryMark\u2019s specific, \nlocal economics at all.10 Owing to the consolidated nature \nof the case, CountryMark could spend just two sentences \nexplaining why millions of dollars of compliance costs \nunder the RFS created disproportionate hardship for \nCountryMark and threatened its continued financial \nviability.\nIt is hard to see how CountryMark\u2019s appeal could \nreceive the individualized attention it is entitled to \nwithin just 0.025% of the opening brief\u2014and none of \nthe reply. If CountryMark had remained in the Seventh \n8.\u2002 See Order Granting EPA\u2019s Motion to Transfer, Countrymark \nRefin. and Logistics, LLC v. EPA, No. 22-2368 (7th Cir.

LLC, et al. v. EPA, No. 22-\n1073 (D.C. Cir., Jun. 15, 2023).\n10.\u2002 See generally Final Joint Reply Brief of Petitioner-\nAppellants, Sinclair Wyoming Refin. Co. LLC, et al. v. EPA, No. \n22-1073 (D.C. Cir., Jan. 9, 2024).\n\n12\nCircuit, it would have had 14,000 words in the opening \nbrief\u2014and 7,000 in the reply\u2014to discuss its individual \neconomic reality and its disproportionate hardship \nunder the RFS.11 If CountryMark\u2019s case had remained \nin the Seventh Circuit, it would have had that court\u2019s full \nattention. CountryMark would have been able to explain \nits particular operations, customers, and market factors. \nIts hardships would have been fully and fairly considered \nby judges in CountryMark\u2019s regional circuit, as Congress \nintended.\n3.\t CountryMark lost its opportunity for timely \njudicial review of the denial of its SRE hardship \npetition.\nCongress recognized that the CAA\u2019s fuel mandates \ncould pose an existential threat to smaller refineries, hence \nthe exemption system for refiners facing \u201cdisproportionate \nhardship.\u201d A smaller refinery facing this existential threat \nneeds timely review of its SRE hardship petition. So the \nCAA directs EPA to act on an SRE hardship petition \nwithin 90 days of receipt. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07545(o)(9)(B)(iii). \nNeedless to say, if EPA denies a hardship petition, the \nsmall refinery also needs timely adjudication of its petition \nfor review of that decision; vindication delivered months, \nand in some cases, years, too late is small comfort.\nThe dozens of SRE petitioners, including CountryMark, \nwho were bundled together in the D.C. Circuit in Sinclair \nWyoming filed SRE hardship petitions as early as 2016, \nreceived denials from EPA in April and June 2022, and \nwere given judicial decisions in the D.C. Circuit in July \n11.\u2002 Seventh Circuit Local Rule 32(c).\n\n13\n2024. Sinclair Wyoming Refin. Co. LLC v. EPA, 114 F.4th \n696, 704 (D.C. Cir. 2024). That means that for more than \nhalf of the existence of the renewable fuel mandate, small \nrefineries like CountryMark have operated in regulatory \nuncertainty that threatened their very existence. See 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07545(o)(9)(A)(i) (directing that the renewable \nfuel mandate will apply to small refineries beginning in \n2011). It is true that much of the delay is attributable to \nEPA\u2019s failure to act on the petitions in a timely fashion.12 \nBut not all. \nVenue mattered. The Fifth Circuit declined to transfer \nits petitions to the D.C. Circuit. It resolved both the venue \ndispute and the merits of those petitions eight months \nbefore the D.C. Circuit adjudicated the dozens of petitions \nbundled together in the April and June 2022 denials. See \nCalumet Shreveport Refin., LLC v. EPA, 86 F.4th 1121 \n(5th Cir. 2023). The distributed workload designed by \nCongress is better suited for timely adjudication of SRE \nhardship petitions. Delayed decision-making leads to \ngreater economic uncertainty. Along with the threats of \nincreasing RVOs and rising RIN prices, delay undermines \nCountryMark\u2019s ability to plan for the future and maintain \nits economic viability for its 140,000 farmer-owners and \ntheir customers.\n12.\u2002 Respondents ably explain why EPA should not be allowed \nto use that unlawful delay to turn dozens of local decisions into \none or two \u201cnational\u201d ones.

CountryMark is \nowned by more than 140,000 farmers. It is headquartered \nin Indiana.\nCountryMark has a significant interest in this \nappeal because, while small refineries (rightly) prevailed \nin the recent Sinclair Wyoming decision in the D.C. \nCircuit, CountryMark did not get its own day in court \nto specifically and fully address the disproportionate \neconomic hardship that is suffers. CountryMark\u2019s case \nwas improperly consolidated with those of 25 other small \nrefineries. See Sinclair Wyoming Refin. Co. LLC v. EPA, \n101 F.4th 871 (D.C. Cir. 2024). As a result, CountryMark\u2019s \nparticular economic circumstances were mentioned in \njust two sentences in the briefs before the D.C. Circuit. It \nhad no chance to fully and fairly explain how denial of its \nhardship petitions could jeopardize its ability to continue \noperating.\nThe demise of CountryMark would significantly \nharm the rural region in which it operates. CountryMark \nemploys nearly 500 workers, concentrated in the rural \neconomy of southwest Indiana and southeast Illinois. \n1.\u2002 No counsel for a party authored this brief in whole or in \npart. No such counsel or a party made a monetary contribution \nintended to fund the preparation or submission of this brief. No \nperson other than the amicus curiae, its members, or its counsel, \nmade such a monetary contribution.\n\n2\nIn Posey County, Indiana, a county with only 25,000 \nresidents, CountryMark provides over $30 million in \nwages and benefits each year. In 2024, it purchased over \n$800 million of crude oil primarily from the Illinois Basin, \nand those purchases provided income to the 40,000 royalty \nowners in the Illinois Basin. Its products are also sold and \ndistributed through its branded dealer network, providing \nemployment throughout rural communities in its area.\nCountryMark is the only farmer-owned integrated \noil company in the United States, and it is recognized in \nIndiana as a leader in the distribution of biodiesel and \nethanol. Its refinery, which uses 100% American crude \noil, processes 35,000 barrels of crude per day. It supplies \nover 70% of agricultural market fuels and 50% of school \ndistrict fuels in Indiana. Although CountryMark is a \ncritical participant in its regional market, it operates as \na small refinery relative to its peers, with a capacity that \nis merely one-tenth the size of the average refinery in its \nregion.\nCountryMark is precisely the type of small refinery \nCongress envisioned when enacting Small Refinery \nExemptions (\u201cSRE\u201d). For CountryMark, SREs are not \na mechanism to avoid compliance with Congressional \nmandates; rather, they are vital tools to sustain economic \nviability while advancing renewable fuel adoption\u2014an \neffort CountryMark has championed since before such \nmandates existed.\nCountryMark is an Obligated Party under the \nRenewable Fuel Standard (\u201cRFS\u201d). Despite its early \nadoption of renewable fuels, CountryMark\u2019s customers \nare unable or unwilling to blend sufficient renewable \n\n3\nfuels to meet the company\u2019s annual RFS obligations. \nWhile CountryMark has invested significantly in blending \ninfrastructure, the continued escalation of Renewable \nVolume Obligations (\u201cRVOs\u201d), combined with rising \nRenewable Identification Number (\u201cRIN\u201d) prices, renders \ncompliance financially unsustainable without relief \nthrough SREs.\nTo address the economic hardship imposed by the \nRFS, CountryMark has sought SREs under the Clean \nAir Act (\u201cCAA\u201d). By statute, these exemptions must be \ndetermined based on the applicant\u2019s individual economic \ncircumstances. When the Environmental Protection \nAgency (\u201cEPA\u201d) denied CountryMark\u2019s RFS hardship \npetitions, CountryMark sought judicial review in its \nregional circuit. But, on EPA\u2019s motion, the cases were \ntransferred to the D.C. Circuit and consolidated with other \nrefineries\u2019 petitions, denying CountryMark its statutory \nright to review of its particular economic hardships by \nits regional circuit. CountryMark thus has significant \ninterest in this Court\u2019s affirmance of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \ndetermination that the proper venue for review of EPA\u2019s \ndecisions on SRE petitions is the small refinery\u2019s regional \ncircuit.\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\nThe Fifth Circuit correctly determined that the \nproper venue for judicial review of EPA\u2019s decision on \nSRE petitions is the regional circuit of the petitioning \nsmall refinery. The specific economic circumstances of \nthe small refinery and the area in which it operates are \nthe statutorily required and exclusive bases for EPA \ndeterminations of RFS hardship applications. A small \n\n4\nrefinery is almost by definition a local or regional concern. \nSee 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07545(o)(1)(K). Thus, the SRE applicant\u2019s \nregional circuit is best suited to address the application \nand the local economic realities that should underlie EPA\u2019s \ndecision.\nCongress concluded that localized EPA decisions \nshould be reviewed by local jurisdictions. 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a07607(b)(1). That is a rational division of labor for at least \nthree reasons.\nFirst, local jurisdictions are best equipped to render \ndecisions based on local economic realities. Indeed, in \nlarge measure, that is the very purpose of having regional \ncourts of appeals. EPA, along with supporting amici from \ntrade associations that represent non-obligated entities, \nwrongly assume that fuel prices are generally set in the \ncontext of a national market. All states and regions have \ndifferent fuel prices, which are driven by the supply and \ndemand in local markets. Anyone who travels regularly \ncan attest that fuel prices in Indiana, California, and \nLouisiana differ widely\u2014driven by local or regional supply \nand demand. Fuel prices in Posey County in southern \nIndiana are noticeably different from those of Chicago-\nadjacent Lake County, Indiana. CountryMark, which is an \nObligated Party, operates wholesale terminals in several \nmarkets and experiences these local economic differences \nevery day. This reinforces the need for review of EPA \ndecisions in the SRE applicant\u2019s regional circuit.\nSecond, distributing localized EPA actions among \nthe regional circuits ensures that petitioners get the \nindividualized review that the CAA contemplates. The \nCAA directs EPA to evaluate \u201ca\u201d hardship petition \nbased on whether the particular petitioner would face \n\n5\na \u201cdisproportionate economic hardship\u201d if required to \ncomply with renewable fuel standards. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07545(o)\n(9)(B)(i-ii). It naturally follows that the denial of an SRE \nhardship petition will also get individualized attention in \nthe appropriate court of appeals. But in the joint opening \nbrief in Sinclair Wyoming, CountryMark\u2019s unique \ncircumstances got just two sentences\u2014totaling 60 words. \nAnd CountryMark was not mentioned at all in the joint \nreply brief. CountryMark has a greater opportunity to \ndiscuss its economic hardship in this amicus brief than it \nhad to explain them in Sinclair Wyoming, where it was a \nparty and its own petition was reviewed.\nThird, individual petitioners are more likely to get \nthe timely review required by the CAA if the workload is \ndispersed among the regional circuits. The CAA directs \nEPA to act on an SRE hardship petition within 90 days \nof receipt. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07545(o)(9)(B)(iii). As Respondents \nexplain, EPA ignored that deadline and deprived many \nSRE petitioners of their right to timely review. See \nRespondents Br. 17, 25-26, 39-40 (Jan. 21, 2025). That \ndelay was exacerbated by the consolidation of dozens of \npetitions in the D.C. Circuit. The Fifth Circuit handled \nits petitions for review months before the D.C. Circuit \nadjudicated its bundle of consolidated cases.\nEPA is wrong to assert that venue lies exclusively in \nthe D.C. Circuit for every petitioner seeking appeal of an \nSRE hardship petition ruling. EPA is wrong about the \nfuel market: fuel prices are local and regional rather than \nnational. And EPA is wrong about the process here. Venue \nshould not shift to the D.C. Circuit merely because EPA \nbundled quintessentially local SRE hardship petitions \ntogether.\n\n6\nARGUMENT\n1.\t CountryMark\u2019s local market conditions dictate \nwhether it can meet the federal renewable fuels \nmandate.\nThe individualized nature of SRE hardship petitions \nmakes regional circuits the \u201cappropriate circuit[s]\u201d \nunder the CAA\u2019s venue provision, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07607(b)(1). \nIndiana-based CountryMark\u2019s SRE petitions should be \nreviewed in the Seventh Circuit. Sending them to the \nD.C. Circuit undermines the statutory framework of the \nCAA. This brief focuses on the practical effects that the \nvenue decision has on a small refinery like CountryMark.\nCountryMark is a quintessential small refinery. It \nis a farmer-owned cooperative that was advancing the \nuse of renewable fuels even before it was subject to a \nfederal law mandate. However, it faces disproportionate \neconomic hardship compared to other refineries\u2014even \nother small refineries\u2014because of circumstances specific \nto its ownership and marketplace.\nCountryMark has invested in fuel blending \ninfrastructure that remains capable of blending enough \nrenewable fuels to meet its annual obligation. But despite \nCountryMark\u2019s infrastructure and a customer base that \nembraced renewable fuels early, CountryMark\u2019s customers \nsimply do not want\u2014and thus will not purchase\u2014the \nhigher renewable fuel blends required for CountryMark\u2019s \ncompliance with EPA mandates.\nCustomers select the percentage of renewable fuels to \nbe blended into their gasoline and diesel when they choose \nwhich fuel mix to purchase. The customer\u2019s preferences \n\n7\nin CountryMark\u2019s market are specific to CountryMark \nand are not \u201cnational\u201d in any sense. In CountryMark\u2019s \nmarketplace, demand remains low for higher blends. \nFor example, E85 (a fuel product typically containing \n85% ethanol and 15% gasoline) is not widely accepted by \nCountryMark\u2019s consumers regardless of price because it \nhas less energy per gallon compared to E10 (10% ethanol; \n90% gasoline).2 That low demand is essentially immune \nto price changes. These local retail economics impact \nCountryMark\u2019s ability to sell fuel blends in sufficient \nquantities to achieve CountryMark\u2019s RVO compliance \nlevels.\nCountryMark\u2019s blend percentages are below the \nfederal government\u2019s CAA mandate because of its \ncustomers\u2019 preferences. They purchase less of the \nhigher fuel blends, resulting in CountryMark\u2019s achieving \nlower blending percentages than the mandate requires. \nCountryMark must then purchase RINs (compliance \ncredits) to achieve RFS compliance. The combination \nof mandated RVO increases above CountryMark\u2019s \nmarketplace\u2019s demand, plus increasing RIN prices, makes \ncontinued compliance practically impossible, and SREs \nvital. Without SREs, CountryMark\u2019s long-term viability \nis threatened.\nAnother economic circumstance specific to \nCountryMark is its disproportionate blending of diesel \n2.\u2002 Ethanol, U.S. Dep\u2019t of Energy, https://www.fueleconomy.\ngov/feg/ethanol.shtml (last visited Jan. 27, 2025) (\u201cDue to ethanol\u2019s \nlower energy content, [flex fuel vehicles] operating on E85 get \nroughly 15% to 27% fewer miles per gallon than when operating \non regular gasoline, depending on the ethanol content. Regular \ngasoline typically contains about 10% ethanol.\u201d).\n\n8\nversus gasoline. CountryMark first blended biodiesel \nin 2006, and it is today considered a leader of biodiesel \nblending in Indiana.3 Unsurprisingly, its farmer members \nand their rural customers require more diesel fuel than \ngasoline.\nCountryMark consequently operates its refinery to \nmaximize diesel fuel production to meet the requirements \nof its diesel-centric farmer members and customers. \nBecause of CountryMark\u2019s local customer demand, \nCountryMark sells more diesel fuel through its member \nretail network than it can produce at its refinery, so it must \npurchase diesel from other suppliers to meet customer \ndemand.\nEven though biodiesel helps meet this demand, \ncustomers strongly disfavor it, and therefore buy much \nless of it. This results in a disproportionate economic \nhardship for CountryMark compared to other refiners. \nAnd to preclude all doubt, the Department of Energy \nhas recognized that high diesel production is a criteria \nfor disproportionate economic harm in its small refinery \nexemption study.4 This is exacerbated for CountryMark.\nCountryMark\u2019s customers are integrated with the \nagricultural community, and they are knowledgeable \nusers of renewable fuels\u2014both ethanol and biodiesel. \nImportantly, CountryMark\u2019s customers are aware \n3.\u2002 Meggie Foster, CountryMark Debuts New Brand, Re-\nenergized Vision, Farm World (Jun. 20, 2007), http://www.\nfarmworldonline.com/news/ArchiveArticle.asp?newsid=4377.\n4.\u2002 U.S. Dep\u2019t of Energy, Small Refinery Exemption Study: An \nInvestigation into Disproportionate Economic Hardship 33 (Mar. \n2011), https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-12/documents/\nsmall-refinery-exempt-study.pdf.\n\n9\nthat biodiesel does not work well in cold temperatures, \nfor which Indiana winters are well known. This is an \nacute concern for agricultural consumers because \nthey frequently store diesel fuel on-site, year-round. \nConsequently, CountryMark can sell less than 2% of \nbiodiesel on an annual average basis as a percentage of \nall diesel sales. Contrast this with non-obligated parties \nlike large truck stops who sell to on-road truckers. Truck \nstops can routinely blend 20% biodiesel in their product \nbecause on-road truckers immediately consume the fuel, \nand thus do not have to worry about exposing that diesel \nfuel to the elements in longer-term storage.\nThese local marketplace factors preclude \nCountryMark\u2019s opportunity to blend biodiesel into diesel \nfuel, as compared to blending ethanol into gasoline. \nEven if CountryMark were to try to force a 5% biodiesel \nblend on customers, that would not be enough to meet \nCountryMark\u2019s RFS obligations. Since higher biodiesel \nblends are not as accepted in the market, CountryMark \ndoes not sell as many biodiesel blends at 10% or higher.\nWithout having the ability to sell higher renewable \nblends in diesel fuel, CountryMark is structurally \ndisadvantaged compared to other refineries. By favoring \nthe production of diesel fuel to meet the needs of its \nregional agricultural market, CountryMark does not \nproduce enough gasoline for ethanol blending at any \npercentage that would eliminate the need to purchase \nhigh-priced RINs.\nCountryMark operates in a volatile fuel market and \nits disproportionate economic hardship is structural. \nCountryMark produces more diesel fuel than a typical \n\n10\nrefinery to serve its farmer-owners, and it is located in \nan extremely competitive market with multiple refineries, \npipelines, and terminals. \nAs a result, EPA needs to reevaluate each year whether \nthe exemption should be extended to CountryMark, \njust as Congress directed. When EPA gets the SRE \ndetermination wrong, CountryMark should be heard \nindividually, not bundled with other geographically \ndispersed SRE petitioners. And its statutory venue is the \nSeventh Circuit, its regional court of appeals.\n2.\t CountryMark lost its opportunity for individualized \njudicial review of the denial of its SRE hardship \npetition.\nCountryMark filed a petition for review of EPA\u2019s denial \nof its hardship petition for 2018 in the Seventh Circuit in \nMay 2022.5 In this petition, CountryMark sought to bring \nbefore its regional circuit its unique and local economic \nfactors. Instead of consideration by the Seventh Circuit \nof these CountryMark-centric economics factors, the case \nwas transferred to the D.C. Circuit on EPA\u2019s motion.6\nCountryMark also filed a petition for review of EPA\u2019s \ndenial of its hardship petitions for 2019, 2020, and 2021 \nin the Seventh Circuit in August 2022.7 As with the May \n5.\u2002 See Petition for Review, Countrymark Refin. and Logistics, \nLLC v. EPA, No. 22-1878 (7th Cir. May 18, 2022).\n6.\u2002 See Order Granting EPA\u2019s Motion to Transfer, Countrymark \nRefin. and Logistics, LLC v. EPA, No. 22-1878 (7th Cir. Jul. 20, \n2022); Countrymark Refin. and Logistics, LLC v. EPA, No. 22-\n1165 (D.C. Cir.).\n7.\u2002 See Petition for Review, Countrymark Refin. and Logistics, \nLLC v. EPA, No. 22-2368 (7th Cir. Aug. 3, 2022).\n\n11\npetition for review, the August petition was transferred \nto the D.C. Circuit on EPA\u2019s motion.8 CountryMark\u2019s \npetitions for review were consolidated with 25 other small \nrefineries into an omnibus case in the D.C. Circuit. See \nSinclair Wyoming Refin. Co. LLC, et al. v. EPA, No. 22-\n1073 (D.C. Cir.).\nIn the small refinery petitioners\u2019 joint opening brief \nin Sinclair Wyoming, CountryMark\u2019s unique economic \ncircumstances got two sentences\u2014just 60 words in an \nopening brief of 23,970 words.9 And in the joint reply brief \nthere was no room to mention CountryMark\u2019s specific, \nlocal economics at all.10 Owing to the consolidated nature \nof the case, CountryMark could spend just two sentences \nexplaining why millions of dollars of compliance costs \nunder the RFS created disproportionate hardship for \nCountryMark and threatened its continued financial \nviability.\nIt is hard to see how CountryMark\u2019s appeal could \nreceive the individualized attention it is entitled to \nwithin just 0.025% of the opening brief\u2014and none of \nthe reply. If CountryMark had remained in the Seventh \n8.\u2002 See Order Granting EPA\u2019s Motion to Transfer, Countrymark \nRefin. and Logistics, LLC v. EPA, No. 22-2368 (7th Cir. Sep. 8, \n2022); Countrymark Refin. and Logistics, LLC v. EPA, No. 22-\n1238 (D.C. Cir.).\n9.\u2002 See Final Joint Opening Brief of Petitioner-Appellants at \n17, 81, Sinclair Wyoming Refin. Co. LLC, et al. v. EPA, No. 22-\n1073 (D.C. Cir., Jun. 15, 2023).\n10.\u2002 See generally Final Joint Reply Brief of Petitioner-\nAppellants, Sinclair Wyoming Refin. Co. LLC, et al. v. EPA, No. \n22-1073 (D.C. Cir., Jan. 9, 2024).\n\n12\nCircuit, it would have had 14,000 words in the opening \nbrief\u2014and 7,000 in the reply\u2014to discuss its individual \neconomic reality and its disproportionate hardship \nunder the RFS.11 If CountryMark\u2019s case had remained \nin the Seventh Circuit, it would have had that court\u2019s full \nattention. CountryMark would have been able to explain \nits particular operations, customers, and market factors. \nIts hardships would have been fully and fairly considered \nby judges in CountryMark\u2019s regional circuit, as Congress \nintended.\n3.\t CountryMark lost its opportunity for timely \njudicial review of the denial of its SRE hardship \npetition.\nCongress recognized that the CAA\u2019s fuel mandates \ncould pose an existential threat to smaller refineries, hence \nthe exemption system for refiners facing \u201cdisproportionate \nhardship.\u201d A smaller refinery facing this existential threat \nneeds timely review of its SRE hardship petition. So the \nCAA directs EPA to act on an SRE hardship petition \nwithin 90 days of receipt. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07545(o)(9)(B)(iii). \nNeedless to say, if EPA denies a hardship petition, the \nsmall refinery also needs timely adjudication of its petition \nfor review of that decision; vindication delivered months, \nand in some cases, years, too late is small comfort.\nThe dozens of SRE petitioners, including CountryMark, \nwho were bundled together in the D.C. Circuit in Sinclair \nWyoming filed SRE hardship petitions as early as 2016, \nreceived denials from EPA in April and June 2022, and \nwere given judicial decisions in the D.C. Circuit in July \n11.\u2002 Seventh Circuit Local Rule 32(c).\n\n13\n2024. Sinclair Wyoming Refin. Co. LLC v. EPA, 114 F.4th \n696, 704 (D.C. Cir. 2024). That means that for more than \nhalf of the existence of the renewable fuel mandate, small \nrefineries like CountryMark have operated in regulatory \nuncertainty that threatened their very existence. See 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a07545(o)(9)(A)(i) (directing that the renewable \nfuel mandate will apply to small refineries beginning in \n2011). It is true that much of the delay is attributable to \nEPA\u2019s failure to act on the petitions in a timely fashion.12 \nBut not all. \nVenue mattered. The Fifth Circuit declined to transfer \nits petitions to the D.C. Circuit. It resolved both the venue \ndispute and the merits of those petitions eight months \nbefore the D.C. Circuit adjudicated the dozens of petitions \nbundled together in the April and June 2022 denials. See \nCalumet Shreveport Refin., LLC v. EPA, 86 F.4th 1121 \n(5th Cir. 2023). The distributed workload designed by \nCongress is better suited for timely adjudication of SRE \nhardship petitions. Delayed decision-making leads to \ngreater economic uncertainty. Along with the threats of \nincreasing RVOs and rising RIN prices, delay undermines \nCountryMark\u2019s ability to plan for the future and maintain \nits economic viability for its 140,000 farmer-owners and \ntheir customers.\n12.\u2002 Respondents ably explain why EPA should not be allowed \nto use that unlawful delay to turn dozens of local decisions into \none or two \u201cnational\u201d ones. Respondents Br. 17, 25-26, 39-40 (Jan. \n21, 2025).\n\n14\nCONCLUSION\nCountryMark exemplifies the localized challenges \nfaced by small refineries. Its operations are deeply \nembedded in the region within which it operates. These \nunique regional dynamics are best understood and \nadjudicated within CountryMark\u2019s regional circuit.\nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s venue ruling should be upheld to \nensure that EPA\u2019s actions on SRE applicants\u2019 petitions \nare reviewed within the applicants\u2019 regional circuits. \nThis approach respects the individualized nature of SRE \ndeterminations, reinforces statutory compliance, and \npreserves the rights of small refineries like CountryMark \nto operate within a fair and sustainable regulatory \nframework.\nRespectfully submitted,\nJanuary 28, 2025\nAaron M.

Six of those refineries petitioned \nfor review of EPA\u2019s decisions in the Fifth Circuit, which \ndenied the government\u2019s motion to transfer the peti-\ntions to the D.C. Circuit.  The question presented is as \nfollows: \nWhether venue for the refineries\u2019 challenges lies ex-\nclusively in the D.C. Circuit because the denial actions \nare \u201cnationally applicable\u201d or, alternatively, are \u201cbased \non a determination of nationwide scope or effect.\u201d  42 \nU.S.C. 7607(b)(1). \n \n \n\n(III) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage\nOpinion below ................................................................................ 1 \nJurisdiction .................................................................................... 1 \nStatutory provisions involved ...................................................... 1 \nStatement: \nA. \nLegal background ............................................................ 2 \nB. \nFacts and proceedings below ......................................... 6 \nSummary of argument ............................................................... 14 \nArgument: \nThe D.C.

Petitions for rehearing were de-\nnied on January 22, 2024 (Pet. App. 331a-333a).  On April \n11, 2024, Justice Alito extended the time within which \nto file a petition for a writ of certiorari to and including \nMay 21, 2024.  The petition for a writ of certiorari was \nfiled on May 20, 2024, and was granted on October 21, \n2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court rests on 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent statutory provisions are reprinted in the \nappendix.  App., infra, 1a-32a. \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal Background \n1. When a petitioner seeks review of a \u201cfinal action\u201d \ntaken by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \nunder the Clean Air Act (CAA), 42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq., \nSection 7607(b)(1) of Title 42 provides for direct court \nof appeals review of the petitioner\u2019s challenge.  To de-\ntermine which circuit has exclusive venue over the chal-\nlenge, Section 7607(b)(1) separates EPA\u2019s final actions \ninto three categories.  First, challenges to certain spec-\nified actions or to \u201cany other nationally applicable reg-\nulations promulgated, or final action taken,\u201d must be \nfiled \u201conly in the United States Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  Second, \nchallenges to actions that are \u201clocally or regionally ap-\nplicable may be filed only in the United States Court of \nAppeals for the appropriate circuit.\u201d  Ibid.  Third, \n\u201c[n]otwithstanding\u201d the sentence directing review of lo-\ncally or regionally applicable actions to \u201cthe appropri-\nate circuit,\u201d challenges to such locally or regionally ap-\nplicable actions \u201cmay be filed only in the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia if such ac-\ntion is based on a determination of nationwide scope or \neffect and if in taking such action the Administrator \nfinds and publishes that such action is based on such a \ndetermination.\u201d  Ibid.   \nCongress adopted this three-prong structure in \n1977.  See Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977, Pub. L. \nNo. 95, 91 Stat. 776.  The predecessor to Section \n7607(b)(1) had provided for direct court of appeals re-\nview only of certain specifically enumerated EPA ac-\ntions.  42 U.S.C. 1857h-5(b)(1) (1970).  EPA actions in-\nvolving \u201cnational primary or secondary ambient air \nquality standard[s],\u201d \u201cemission standard[s],\u201d or other \n\n3 \n \nspecified standards or controls were reviewable only in \nthe D.C. Circuit, while EPA\u2019s actions \u201cin approving or \npromulgating\u201d a state or federal \u201cimplementation plan\u201d \nwere reviewable only in \u201cthe appropriate circuit.\u201d  Ibid.  \nThat division reflected Congress\u2019s view that EPA ac-\ntions that are \u201cnational in scope\u201d should receive \u201ceven \nand consistent national application,\u201d which would be ac-\ncomplished through centralized D.C. Circuit review.   \nS. Rep. No. 1196, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 41 (1970) (1970 \nSenate Report).  By contrast, Congress viewed EPA ac-\ntions approving or promulgating \u201cimplementation plans \nwhich run only to one air quality control region\u201d as ap-\npropriately reviewed \u201cin the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Circuit in which the affected air quality control re-\ngion, or portion thereof, is located.\u201d  Ibid.  At that time, \nthe venue provision did not include a catchall for other \nnationally or locally or regionally applicable actions, nor \ndid the provision specifically reference EPA actions \nthat are based on a determination of nationwide scope \nor effect.  Rather, final actions that the CAA venue pro-\nvision did not specifically address were reviewable only \nby a district court exercising federal-question jurisdic-\ntion.  See Harrison v. PPG Industries, Inc., 446 U.S. \n578, 584 (1980).   \nIn 1977, Congress amended the statute to authorize \ndirect court of appeals review of all EPA \u201cfinal actions\u201d \nunder the CAA.  Congress achieved that result by add-\ning the catchall categories for the first two subsets of \nfinal actions, and by adding the third category of locally \nor regionally applicable actions that are based on a de-\ntermination of nationwide scope or effect.  The House \nReport accompanying the amendment explained that \nthe revision would \u201cprovide[] for essentially locally, \nstatewide, or regionally applicable rules or orders to be \n\n4 \n \nreviewed in the U.S. court of appeals for the circuit in \nwhich such locality, State, or region is located.\u201d  H.R. \nRep. No. 294, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 323 (1977) (1977 \nHouse Report).  \u201cOn the other hand,\u201d the report ex-\nplained, venue would lie only in the D.C. Circuit \u201cif an \naction of the Administrator is found by him to be based \non a determination of nationwide scope or effect (includ-\ning a determination which has scope or effect beyond a \nsingle judicial circuit).\u201d  Id. at 324.   \n2. The EPA actions at issue in this case involve the \nRenewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program, a CAA pro-\ngram that generally requires transportation fuel sold or \nintroduced into commerce in the United States to con-\ntain specified volumes of renewable fuel.  See 42 U.S.C. \n7545(o)(2)(A)(i) and (B)(i).  To implement the program, \nEPA expresses renewable-fuel targets as a percentage \nof the gasoline and diesel fuel that is projected to be sold \nin the upcoming year, and the agency adopts regulations \nto ensure compliance.  See 42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(2)(A)(i); see \nalso 42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(3).  Obligated parties \u201cuse that \nannual-percentage standard to determine their volume \nobligations\u201d for the year.  Pet. App. 3a.  Each obligated \nparty\u2019s renewable-fuel-volume obligation is propor-\ntional to its annual production or importation of gaso-\nline and diesel fuel.   \nEPA\u2019s implementing regulations identify refineries \nand importers of gasoline and diesel as obligated parties \nsubject to RFS requirements.  40 C.F.R. 80.2, 80.1406.  \nTo track whether an obligated party has satisfied RFS \nprogram requirements, EPA uses a credit system that \noffers parties flexibility in achieving compliance.  See 42 \nU.S.C. 7545(o)(5).  Producers and importers of renewa-\nble fuels generate credits\u2014called Renewable Identifi-\ncation Numbers (RINs)\u2014for each gallon of renewable \n\n5 \n \nfuel they produce or import for use in the United States.  \n40 C.F.R. 80.1426(a).  The producers and importers as-\nsign a RIN to each batch of renewable fuel.  40 C.F.R. \n80.1426(e).  A RIN may be used after it is \u201cseparated\u201d \nfrom its batch by an obligated party or by an entity that \nblends the renewable fuel into gasoline or diesel.  40 \nC.F.R. 80.1429(b).  Once separated, RINs may be kept \nfor compliance or sold.  40 C.F.R. 80.1425-80.1429.  Each \nyear, a refinery may generate its own credits by blend-\ning renewable fuel into transportation fuel, or it may \npurchase the requisite number of credits.  See Pet. App. \n206a-207a; see also 42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(5)(B) and (E); 40 \nC.F.R. 80.1428(b), 80.1429(b). \nObligated parties meet their renewable-fuel-volume \nobligations by \u201cretir[ing]\u201d RINs in an annual compli-\nance demonstration.  40 C.F.R. 80.1427(a)(1).  A refin-\nery may use a particular RIN only during the calendar \nyear in which it was generated or in the following calen-\ndar year.  40 C.F.R. 80.1427(a)(6), 80.1428(c).  An obli-\ngated party who fails to demonstrate full compliance in \none year may carry forward a compliance deficit to the \nfollowing year.  42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(5)(D).  \nCongress created a three-tiered scheme through \nwhich obligated parties that qualify as \u201c[s]mall refiner-\nies\u201d may obtain exemptions from RFS program require-\nments.  42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9) (emphasis omitted); see 42 \nU.S.C. 7545(o)(1)(k) (defining \u201csmall refinery\u201d).   \nFirst, Congress granted all small refineries a blan-\nket exemption until 2011.  42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(A)(i). \nSecond, Congress directed the U.S. Department of \nEnergy (DOE) to study \u201cwhether compliance with the \nrequirements of [the RFS program] would impose a dis-\nproportionate economic hardship on small refineries.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(A)(ii)(I).  For any small refinery \n\n6 \n \nthat DOE determined \u201cwould be subject to a dispropor-\ntionate economic hardship if required to comply,\u201d Con-\ngress directed EPA to extend the exemption for at least \ntwo years.  42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(A)(ii)(II). \nThird, Congress established a mechanism through \nwhich a small refinery \u201cmay at any time petition [EPA] \nfor an extension of the exemption under subparagraph \n(A) for the reason of disproportionate economic hard-\nship.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(B)(i).  In evaluating a peti-\ntion for such an exemption, EPA, \u201cin consultation with\u201d \nDOE, \u201cshall consider the findings of [DOE\u2019s study] and \nother economic factors.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(B)(ii). \nB. Facts And Proceedings Below \n1. In August 2019, EPA issued a single decision act-\ning on 36 exemption petitions filed by small refineries \nfor the 2018 compliance year, granting 31 petitions and \ndenying five.  See C.A. App. 2928.  Multiple parties pe-\ntitioned for review of the action in the D.C. Circuit.  See \nSinclair Wyoming Ref. Co. v. EPA, No. 19-1196; Big \nWest Oil, LLC v. EPA, No. 19-1197; Renewable Fuels \nAss\u2019n v. EPA, No. 19-1220; Kern Oil & Ref. Co. v. EPA, \nNo. 19-1216; Wynnewood Ref. Co. v. EPA, No. 20-1099.   \nWhile those challenges were pending, the Tenth Cir-\ncuit issued a decision vacating and remanding three \nEPA orders granting three exemption petitions for the \n2016 and 2017 compliance years.  Renewable Fuels Ass\u2019n \nv. EPA, 948 F.3d 1206, 1258 (2020).  The court held that \na small refinery is eligible for an extension of an exemp-\ntion only if it has maintained a continuous, uninter-\nrupted exemption, id. at 1245-1249; that \u201crenewable \nfuels compliance must be the cause of any dispropor-\ntionate hardship\u201d in order for an exemption to be avail-\nable, id. at 1253; and that EPA had \u201c\u200a\u2018failed to consider \nan important aspect of the problem\u2019\u200a\u201d when it did not ad-\n\n7 \n \ndress whether refiners could \u201cpass RIN costs on to cus-\ntomers,\u201d id. at 1257 (citation omitted).  This Court \ngranted a petition for a writ of certiorari limited to the \nfirst of those Tenth Circuit holdings.  HollyFrontier \nCheyenne Ref., LLC v. Renewable Fuels Ass\u2019n, 141  \nS. Ct. 974 (2021).  Pending this Court\u2019s resolution of \nHollyFrontier, the D.C. Circuit granted EPA\u2019s motion \nto hold in abeyance the petitions for review that had \nbeen filed in that court. See Sinclair Wyoming Ref. Co. \nv. EPA, No. 19-1196, Doc. 1883334 (Feb. 2, 2021); p. 6, \nsupra.   \nThis Court reversed the Tenth Circuit decision in \nHollyFrontier, holding that a small refinery may be el-\nigible for an exemption renewal even if the refinery had \nallowed a prior exemption to lapse.  HollyFrontier \nCheyenne Ref., LLC v. Renewable Fuels Ass\u2019n, 594 U.S. \n382, 390 (2021).  In the pending D.C. Circuit proceed-\nings, EPA then moved for a voluntary remand without \nvacatur to allow the agency to reconsider its action on \nthe 2018 exemption petitions in light of this Court\u2019s de-\ncision in HollyFrontier, and in light of the Tenth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s analysis in Renewable Fuels Association of addi-\ntional issues this Court had not reached.  See Sinclair \nWyoming Ref. Co., No. 19-1196, Doc. 1911606 (Aug. 25, \n2021).  The D.C. Circuit granted that motion and in-\nstructed EPA to act on the petitions within 120 days.  \nSinclair Wyoming Ref. Co., No. 19-1196, Doc. 1925942 \n(Dec. 8, 2021).   \n2. In December 2021, EPA proposed to deny all \npending small refinery exemption petitions.  86 Fed. \nReg. 70,999 (Dec. 14, 2021); see C.A. App. 520-585.  \nSeeking to create a nationally uniform program, EPA \nproposed to adopt the Tenth Circuit\u2019s reasoning in Re-\nnewable Fuels Association on the issues this Court had \n\n8 \n \nnot considered.  Under that approach, EPA proposed to \ninterpret the pertinent statutory provisions as requir-\ning small refineries seeking exemptions to show that \nRFS compliance itself caused a disproportionate eco-\nnomic hardship.  C.A. App. 545-548.  In accordance with \nthe Tenth Circuit\u2019s analysis, EPA also analyzed whether \nrefineries were able to pass on the costs of RFS compli-\nance to consumers.  The agency concluded that the evi-\ndence supported a rebuttable presumption that such \ncosts \u201care fully passed through to consumers,\u201d so that \nsmall refineries ordinarily would not suffer dispropor-\ntionate economic hardship as a result of RFS compli-\nance.  Id. at 549; see id. at 548-584.  In light of those \nconclusions, EPA proposed to deny all the pending ex-\nemption petitions and sought comment on that pro-\nposed decision.   \nAfter the comment period ended, EPA took two ac-\ntions.  In April 2022\u2014the deadline set by the D.C. Cir-\ncuit to resolve the remanded petitions\u2014EPA denied 36 \nexemption petitions filed by small refineries for the \n2018 compliance year.  Pet. App. 193a; see April 2022 \nDenial of Petitions for Small Refinery Exemptions \nUnder the Renewable Fuel Standard Program, 87 Fed. \nReg. 24,300 (Apr. 25, 2022) (April Notice).  In June \n2022, EPA denied an additional 69 petitions for the \n2016-2021 compliance years.  Pet. App. 48a; see Notice \nof June 2022 Denial of Petitions for Small Refinery Ex-\nemptions Under the Renewable Fuel Standard Pro-\ngram, 87 Fed. Reg. 34,873, 34,874 (June 8, 2022) (June \nNotice).  The two denial actions reflect the same reason-\ning and are based on two principal rationales, one stat-\nutory and one economic.1  The denial actions contain ex-\n \n1  For ease of reference, this brief cites only the April 2022 denial \nwhen discussing reasoning common to both actions. \n\n9 \n \nplicit agency findings that the actions are nationally ap-\nplicable or, in the alternative, that they are based on de-\nterminations of nationwide scope or effect. \nStatutory interpretation.  In the April and June 2022 \ndenial actions, EPA concluded that an extension of the \nsmall refinery exemption under the relevant provisions \nmay be granted only if disproportionate economic hard-\nship was \u201ccaused by RFS compliance.\u201d  Pet. App. 242a.  \nFor relevant context, the agency turned to paragraph \n(A) of 42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9), which established the initial \nblanket exemption for small refineries and the two-year \nextension based on the DOE study.  See 42 U.S.C. \n7545(o)(9)(A) and (B).  The agency observed that para-\ngraph (A) focuses on \u201cwhether compliance with the re-\nquirements of [the RFS program] would impose a [dis-\nproportionate economic hardship] on small refineries.\u201d  \nPet. App. 243a (quoting 42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(A)(ii)(I)).  \nBecause paragraph (B) provides for an extension of the \nexemption provided by paragraph (A), EPA construed \nparagraph (B)\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Six of those refineries petitioned \nfor review of EPA\u2019s decisions in the Fifth Circuit, which \ndenied the government\u2019s motion to transfer the peti-\ntions to the D.C. Circuit.  The question presented is as \nfollows: \nWhether venue for the refineries\u2019 challenges lies ex-\nclusively in the D.C.

Petitions for rehearing were de-\nnied on January 22, 2024 (Pet. App. 331a-333a).  On April \n11, 2024, Justice Alito extended the time within which \nto file a petition for a writ of certiorari to and including \nMay 21, 2024.  The petition for a writ of certiorari was \nfiled on May 20, 2024, and was granted on October 21, \n2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court rests on 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent statutory provisions are reprinted in the \nappendix.  App., infra, 1a-32a. \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal Background \n1. When a petitioner seeks review of a \u201cfinal action\u201d \ntaken by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \nunder the Clean Air Act (CAA), 42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq., \nSection 7607(b)(1) of Title 42 provides for direct court \nof appeals review of the petitioner\u2019s challenge.  To de-\ntermine which circuit has exclusive venue over the chal-\nlenge, Section 7607(b)(1) separates EPA\u2019s final actions \ninto three categories.  First, challenges to certain spec-\nified actions or to \u201cany other nationally applicable reg-\nulations promulgated, or final action taken,\u201d must be \nfiled \u201conly in the United States Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  Second, \nchallenges to actions that are \u201clocally or regionally ap-\nplicable may be filed only in the United States Court of \nAppeals for the appropriate circuit.\u201d  Ibid.  Third, \n\u201c[n]otwithstanding\u201d the sentence directing review of lo-\ncally or regionally applicable actions to \u201cthe appropri-\nate circuit,\u201d challenges to such locally or regionally ap-\nplicable actions \u201cmay be filed only in the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia if such ac-\ntion is based on a determination of nationwide scope or \neffect and if in taking such action the Administrator \nfinds and publishes that such action is based on such a \ndetermination.\u201d  Ibid.   \nCongress adopted this three-prong structure in \n1977.  See Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977, Pub. L. \nNo. 95, 91 Stat. 776.  The predecessor to Section \n7607(b)(1) had provided for direct court of appeals re-\nview only of certain specifically enumerated EPA ac-\ntions.  42 U.S.C. 1857h-5(b)(1) (1970).  EPA actions in-\nvolving \u201cnational primary or secondary ambient air \nquality standard[s],\u201d \u201cemission standard[s],\u201d or other \n\n3 \n \nspecified standards or controls were reviewable only in \nthe D.C. Circuit, while EPA\u2019s actions \u201cin approving or \npromulgating\u201d a state or federal \u201cimplementation plan\u201d \nwere reviewable only in \u201cthe appropriate circuit.\u201d  Ibid.  \nThat division reflected Congress\u2019s view that EPA ac-\ntions that are \u201cnational in scope\u201d should receive \u201ceven \nand consistent national application,\u201d which would be ac-\ncomplished through centralized D.C. Circuit review.   \nS. Rep. No. 1196, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 41 (1970) (1970 \nSenate Report).  By contrast, Congress viewed EPA ac-\ntions approving or promulgating \u201cimplementation plans \nwhich run only to one air quality control region\u201d as ap-\npropriately reviewed \u201cin the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Circuit in which the affected air quality control re-\ngion, or portion thereof, is located.\u201d  Ibid.  At that time, \nthe venue provision did not include a catchall for other \nnationally or locally or regionally applicable actions, nor \ndid the provision specifically reference EPA actions \nthat are based on a determination of nationwide scope \nor effect.  Rather, final actions that the CAA venue pro-\nvision did not specifically address were reviewable only \nby a district court exercising federal-question jurisdic-\ntion.  See Harrison v. PPG Industries, Inc., 446 U.S. \n578, 584 (1980).   \nIn 1977, Congress amended the statute to authorize \ndirect court of appeals review of all EPA \u201cfinal actions\u201d \nunder the CAA.  Congress achieved that result by add-\ning the catchall categories for the first two subsets of \nfinal actions, and by adding the third category of locally \nor regionally applicable actions that are based on a de-\ntermination of nationwide scope or effect.  The House \nReport accompanying the amendment explained that \nthe revision would \u201cprovide[] for essentially locally, \nstatewide, or regionally applicable rules or orders to be \n\n4 \n \nreviewed in the U.S. court of appeals for the circuit in \nwhich such locality, State, or region is located.\u201d  H.R. \nRep. No. 294, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 323 (1977) (1977 \nHouse Report).  \u201cOn the other hand,\u201d the report ex-\nplained, venue would lie only in the D.C. Circuit \u201cif an \naction of the Administrator is found by him to be based \non a determination of nationwide scope or effect (includ-\ning a determination which has scope or effect beyond a \nsingle judicial circuit).\u201d  Id. at 324.   \n2. The EPA actions at issue in this case involve the \nRenewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program, a CAA pro-\ngram that generally requires transportation fuel sold or \nintroduced into commerce in the United States to con-\ntain specified volumes of renewable fuel.  See 42 U.S.C. \n7545(o)(2)(A)(i) and (B)(i).  To implement the program, \nEPA expresses renewable-fuel targets as a percentage \nof the gasoline and diesel fuel that is projected to be sold \nin the upcoming year, and the agency adopts regulations \nto ensure compliance.  See 42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(2)(A)(i); see \nalso 42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(3).  Obligated parties \u201cuse that \nannual-percentage standard to determine their volume \nobligations\u201d for the year.  Pet. App. 3a.  Each obligated \nparty\u2019s renewable-fuel-volume obligation is propor-\ntional to its annual production or importation of gaso-\nline and diesel fuel.   \nEPA\u2019s implementing regulations identify refineries \nand importers of gasoline and diesel as obligated parties \nsubject to RFS requirements.  40 C.F.R. 80.2, 80.1406.  \nTo track whether an obligated party has satisfied RFS \nprogram requirements, EPA uses a credit system that \noffers parties flexibility in achieving compliance.  See 42 \nU.S.C. 7545(o)(5).  Producers and importers of renewa-\nble fuels generate credits\u2014called Renewable Identifi-\ncation Numbers (RINs)\u2014for each gallon of renewable \n\n5 \n \nfuel they produce or import for use in the United States.  \n40 C.F.R. 80.1426(a).  The producers and importers as-\nsign a RIN to each batch of renewable fuel.  40 C.F.R. \n80.1426(e).  A RIN may be used after it is \u201cseparated\u201d \nfrom its batch by an obligated party or by an entity that \nblends the renewable fuel into gasoline or diesel.  40 \nC.F.R. 80.1429(b).  Once separated, RINs may be kept \nfor compliance or sold.  40 C.F.R. 80.1425-80.1429.  Each \nyear, a refinery may generate its own credits by blend-\ning renewable fuel into transportation fuel, or it may \npurchase the requisite number of credits.  See Pet. App. \n206a-207a; see also 42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(5)(B) and (E); 40 \nC.F.R. 80.1428(b), 80.1429(b). \nObligated parties meet their renewable-fuel-volume \nobligations by \u201cretir[ing]\u201d RINs in an annual compli-\nance demonstration.  40 C.F.R. 80.1427(a)(1).  A refin-\nery may use a particular RIN only during the calendar \nyear in which it was generated or in the following calen-\ndar year.  40 C.F.R. 80.1427(a)(6), 80.1428(c).  An obli-\ngated party who fails to demonstrate full compliance in \none year may carry forward a compliance deficit to the \nfollowing year.  42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(5)(D).  \nCongress created a three-tiered scheme through \nwhich obligated parties that qualify as \u201c[s]mall refiner-\nies\u201d may obtain exemptions from RFS program require-\nments.  42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9) (emphasis omitted); see 42 \nU.S.C. 7545(o)(1)(k) (defining \u201csmall refinery\u201d).   \nFirst, Congress granted all small refineries a blan-\nket exemption until 2011.  42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(A)(i). \nSecond, Congress directed the U.S. Department of \nEnergy (DOE) to study \u201cwhether compliance with the \nrequirements of [the RFS program] would impose a dis-\nproportionate economic hardship on small refineries.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(A)(ii)(I).  For any small refinery \n\n6 \n \nthat DOE determined \u201cwould be subject to a dispropor-\ntionate economic hardship if required to comply,\u201d Con-\ngress directed EPA to extend the exemption for at least \ntwo years.  42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(A)(ii)(II). \nThird, Congress established a mechanism through \nwhich a small refinery \u201cmay at any time petition [EPA] \nfor an extension of the exemption under subparagraph \n(A) for the reason of disproportionate economic hard-\nship.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(B)(i).  In evaluating a peti-\ntion for such an exemption, EPA, \u201cin consultation with\u201d \nDOE, \u201cshall consider the findings of [DOE\u2019s study] and \nother economic factors.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(B)(ii). \nB. Facts And Proceedings Below \n1. In August 2019, EPA issued a single decision act-\ning on 36 exemption petitions filed by small refineries \nfor the 2018 compliance year, granting 31 petitions and \ndenying five.  See C.A. App. 2928.  Multiple parties pe-\ntitioned for review of the action in the D.C. Circuit.  See \nSinclair Wyoming Ref. Co. v. EPA, No. 19-1196; Big \nWest Oil, LLC v. EPA, No. 19-1197; Renewable Fuels \nAss\u2019n v. EPA, No. 19-1220; Kern Oil & Ref. Co. v. EPA, \nNo. 19-1216; Wynnewood Ref. Co. v. EPA, No. 20-1099.   \nWhile those challenges were pending, the Tenth Cir-\ncuit issued a decision vacating and remanding three \nEPA orders granting three exemption petitions for the \n2016 and 2017 compliance years.  Renewable Fuels Ass\u2019n \nv. EPA, 948 F.3d 1206, 1258 (2020).  The court held that \na small refinery is eligible for an extension of an exemp-\ntion only if it has maintained a continuous, uninter-\nrupted exemption, id. at 1245-1249; that \u201crenewable \nfuels compliance must be the cause of any dispropor-\ntionate hardship\u201d in order for an exemption to be avail-\nable, id. at 1253; and that EPA had \u201c\u200a\u2018failed to consider \nan important aspect of the problem\u2019\u200a\u201d when it did not ad-\n\n7 \n \ndress whether refiners could \u201cpass RIN costs on to cus-\ntomers,\u201d id. at 1257 (citation omitted).  This Court \ngranted a petition for a writ of certiorari limited to the \nfirst of those Tenth Circuit holdings.  HollyFrontier \nCheyenne Ref., LLC v. Renewable Fuels Ass\u2019n, 141  \nS. Ct. 974 (2021).  Pending this Court\u2019s resolution of \nHollyFrontier, the D.C. Circuit granted EPA\u2019s motion \nto hold in abeyance the petitions for review that had \nbeen filed in that court. See Sinclair Wyoming Ref. Co. \nv. EPA, No. 19-1196, Doc. 1883334 (Feb. 2, 2021); p. 6, \nsupra.   \nThis Court reversed the Tenth Circuit decision in \nHollyFrontier, holding that a small refinery may be el-\nigible for an exemption renewal even if the refinery had \nallowed a prior exemption to lapse.  HollyFrontier \nCheyenne Ref., LLC v. Renewable Fuels Ass\u2019n, 594 U.S. \n382, 390 (2021).  In the pending D.C. Circuit proceed-\nings, EPA then moved for a voluntary remand without \nvacatur to allow the agency to reconsider its action on \nthe 2018 exemption petitions in light of this Court\u2019s de-\ncision in HollyFrontier, and in light of the Tenth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s analysis in Renewable Fuels Association of addi-\ntional issues this Court had not reached.  See Sinclair \nWyoming Ref. Co., No. 19-1196, Doc. 1911606 (Aug. 25, \n2021).  The D.C. Circuit granted that motion and in-\nstructed EPA to act on the petitions within 120 days.  \nSinclair Wyoming Ref. Co., No. 19-1196, Doc. 1925942 \n(Dec. 8, 2021).   \n2. In December 2021, EPA proposed to deny all \npending small refinery exemption petitions.  86 Fed. \nReg. 70,999 (Dec. 14, 2021); see C.A. App. 520-585.  \nSeeking to create a nationally uniform program, EPA \nproposed to adopt the Tenth Circuit\u2019s reasoning in Re-\nnewable Fuels Association on the issues this Court had \n\n8 \n \nnot considered.  Under that approach, EPA proposed to \ninterpret the pertinent statutory provisions as requir-\ning small refineries seeking exemptions to show that \nRFS compliance itself caused a disproportionate eco-\nnomic hardship.  C.A. App. 545-548.  In accordance with \nthe Tenth Circuit\u2019s analysis, EPA also analyzed whether \nrefineries were able to pass on the costs of RFS compli-\nance to consumers.  The agency concluded that the evi-\ndence supported a rebuttable presumption that such \ncosts \u201care fully passed through to consumers,\u201d so that \nsmall refineries ordinarily would not suffer dispropor-\ntionate economic hardship as a result of RFS compli-\nance.  Id. at 549; see id. at 548-584.  In light of those \nconclusions, EPA proposed to deny all the pending ex-\nemption petitions and sought comment on that pro-\nposed decision.   \nAfter the comment period ended, EPA took two ac-\ntions.  In April 2022\u2014the deadline set by the D.C. Cir-\ncuit to resolve the remanded petitions\u2014EPA denied 36 \nexemption petitions filed by small refineries for the \n2018 compliance year.  Pet. App. 193a; see April 2022 \nDenial of Petitions for Small Refinery Exemptions \nUnder the Renewable Fuel Standard Program, 87 Fed. \nReg. 24,300 (Apr. 25, 2022) (April Notice).  In June \n2022, EPA denied an additional 69 petitions for the \n2016-2021 compliance years.  Pet. App. 48a; see Notice \nof June 2022 Denial of Petitions for Small Refinery Ex-\nemptions Under the Renewable Fuel Standard Pro-\ngram, 87 Fed. Reg. 34,873, 34,874 (June 8, 2022) (June \nNotice).  The two denial actions reflect the same reason-\ning and are based on two principal rationales, one stat-\nutory and one economic.1  The denial actions contain ex-\n \n1  For ease of reference, this brief cites only the April 2022 denial \nwhen discussing reasoning common to both actions. \n\n9 \n \nplicit agency findings that the actions are nationally ap-\nplicable or, in the alternative, that they are based on de-\nterminations of nationwide scope or effect. \nStatutory interpretation.  In the April and June 2022 \ndenial actions, EPA concluded that an extension of the \nsmall refinery exemption under the relevant provisions \nmay be granted only if disproportionate economic hard-\nship was \u201ccaused by RFS compliance.\u201d  Pet. App. 242a.  \nFor relevant context, the agency turned to paragraph \n(A) of 42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9), which established the initial \nblanket exemption for small refineries and the two-year \nextension based on the DOE study.  See 42 U.S.C. \n7545(o)(9)(A) and (B).  The agency observed that para-\ngraph (A) focuses on \u201cwhether compliance with the re-\nquirements of [the RFS program] would impose a [dis-\nproportionate economic hardship] on small refineries.\u201d  \nPet. App. 243a (quoting 42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(A)(ii)(I)).  \nBecause paragraph (B) provides for an extension of the \nexemption provided by paragraph (A), EPA construed \nparagraph (B) to require a similar causal connection be-\ntween RFS compliance and any resulting economic \nhardship.  Id. at 245a.  The agency found it \u201chard to im-\nagine that Congress intended\u201d to permit exemptions for \nhardships resulting from \u201ca broad array of circum-\nstances unrelated to the RFS program.\u201d  Id. at 247a. \nEconomic analysis.  In implementing the RFS pro-\ngram, EPA has made \u201clongstanding and consistent \nfindings\u201d that obligated parties can pass the costs of \nRFS compliance on to purchasers, a phenomenon called \nRIN cost passthrough.  Pet. App. 248a; see, e.g., Alon \nRef. Krotz Springs, Inc. v. EPA, 936 F.3d 628, 649-650 \n(D.C. Cir. 2019) (per curiam) (discussing earlier studies \nreaching this conclusion), cert. denied, 140 S. Ct. 2792 \n(2020).  In the April and June 2022 denial actions, EPA \n\n10 \n \nreassessed and reaffirmed those prior findings.  Pet. \nApp. 248a-303a; see id. at 240a-241a (explaining related \nconcept of \u201cRIN discount\u201d).  After reviewing extensive \nmarket data, the agency determined that \u201call obligated \nparties recover the cost of acquiring RINs by selling the \ngasoline and diesel fuel they produce at the market \nprice, which reflects these RIN costs.\u201d  Id. at 249a.  EPA \nfurther concluded that \u201cRINs are generally widely \navailable in an open and liquid market,\u201d and that the \n\u201ccost of acquiring RINs is the same for all parties.\u201d  \nIbid. \nGiven that all refineries bear the same costs of RFS \ncompliance and can recover those costs by selling at \nmarket price, EPA found that such costs presumptively \ndo not cause disproportionate economic hardship to any \nsmall refinery.  Pet. App. 248a-250a.  EPA determined \nthat none of the petitioning small refineries had rebut-\nted that presumption through evidence about their spe-\ncific circumstances.  Id. at 251a-252a; see id. at 305a-\n310a. \nVenue.  EPA determined that the denial actions are \nsubject to review exclusively in the D.C. Circuit because \nthey are \u201c\u200a\u2018nationally applicable\u2019\u200a\u201d or, in the alternative, \nbecause they are \u201cbased on a determination of \u2018nation-\nwide scope or effect.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. 328a; id. at 187a (same \nfor June 2022 denial action); see April Notice, 87 Fed. \nReg. at 24,300-24,301; June Notice, 87 Fed. Reg. at \n34,874.  The agency explained that the April 2022 denial \naction encompasses petitions from more than 30 small \nrefineries located within 18 States in seven of the ten \nEPA regions and in eight different federal judicial cir-\ncuits.  Pet. App. 329a; see id. at 187a (similar for June \ndenial).  The agency further observed that the denial \nactions are \u201cbased on EPA\u2019s revised interpretation of \n\n11 \n \nthe relevant CAA provisions and the  * * *  RIN cost \npassthrough principles that are applicable to all small \nrefineries no matter the location or market in which \nthey operate.\u201d  Id. at 329a; see id. at 187a-188a. \n3. Six small refineries filed petitions for review in \nthe Fifth Circuit, collectively challenging both denial \nactions.  Pet. App. 2a, 6a.  Various renewable-fuel trade \nassociations were granted leave to intervene as respond-\nents.  See 22-60266 C.A. Doc. 303-1 (Mar. 16, 2023).  The \ncourt granted the petitions for review, vacated the de-\nnial actions as to the six petitioners, and remanded to \nEPA for further proceedings.  Pet. App. 1a-34a. \na. The court of appeals denied EPA\u2019s motion to trans-\nfer the petitions to the D.C. Circuit.  Pet. App. 9a-15a.  \nThe court held that the denial actions are \u201clocally or re-\ngionally applicable\u201d rather than \u201cnationally applicable,\u201d \n42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1), because the actions\u2019 \u201clegal effect\u201d \nis limited to the petitioning refineries, and the actions \ndo not \u201cbind[\u200a] EPA in any future adjudication,\u201d Pet. \nApp. 11a-12a (emphases omitted).   \nThe court of appeals further held that neither denial \naction is \u201cbased on a determination of nationwide scope \nor effect.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  The court acknowl-\nedged, but disagreed with, EPA\u2019s express finding that \nthe denial actions were based on such determinations.  \nPet. App. 12a-14a.  The court noted that, under EPA\u2019s \ninterpretation of the relevant provisions, the agency \nwill review refinery-specific information to determine \nwhether there is any basis to depart from EPA\u2019s gen-\neral conclusions about market conditions and RIN \npassthrough.  Id. at 15a.  The court of appeals concluded \nthat, because \u201cthere is still a non-zero chance [EPA] will \ngrant small refinery petitions\u201d based on \u201cdata and evi-\ndence\u201d about particular refineries\u2019 circumstances, \u201cthe \n\n12 \n \nDenial Actions rely on refinery-specific determinations \nand are not based on a determination of nationwide \nscope or effect.\u201d  Ibid. \nOn the merits, the Fifth Circuit held the denial ac-\ntions unlawful on three grounds.  Pet. App. 16a-33a.  \nFirst, the court found that small refineries have a pro-\ntectable property interest in being exempt from RFS \nprogram obligations, and that EPA had impermissibly \napplied its new analysis retroactively to deprive the re-\nfineries here of that interest.  Id. at 16a.  Second, the \ncourt rejected the agency\u2019s interpretation of the gov-\nerning statutory language.  The court characterized the \nagency\u2019s position as requiring that \u201ccompliance costs \nmust be the sole cause of\u200a\u201d hardship, id. at 23a, and it \ndisagreed on the ground that hardship may have \u201cmyr-\niad causes,\u201d id. at 25a.  Third, the court concluded that \nthe agency had acted arbitrarily and capriciously.  Id. \nat 29a-33a.  Without questioning the agency\u2019s RIN cost \npassthrough analysis as a general matter, id. at 31a \nn.44, the court found that the analysis was undermined \nas to the petitioning refineries by data concerning the \nparticular local markets in which they operate, id. at \n31a-33a. \nb. Judge Higginbotham dissented as to venue.  Pet. \nApp. 35a-43a.  He would have held that the denial ac-\ntions are \u201cnationally applicable\u201d because they \u201capply \none consistent statutory interpretation and economic \nanalysis to thirty-six small refineries, located in eight-\neen different states, in the geographical boundaries of \neight different circuit courts.\u201d  Id. at 38a.  In the alterna-\ntive, he concluded that the denial actions are \u201c\u200a\u2018based on \na determination of nationwide scope or effect\u2019\u200a\u201d because \nthe \u201ctwo determinations at the[ir] core\u201d\u2014the agency\u2019s \nstatutory interpretation and economic analysis\u2014\u201care ap-\n\n13 \n \nplicable to all small refineries no matter the location or \nmarket in which they operate.\u201d  Id. at 40a-42a. \n4. Other small refineries petitioned for review of the \nApril and June 2022 denial actions in the Third, Sev-\nenth, Ninth, Tenth, Eleventh, and D.C. Circuits.  Each \nof the other regional circuits either dismissed the peti-\ntions without prejudice based on improper venue2 or \ntransferred them to the D.C. Circuit.3   \nThe D.C. Circuit consolidated the various petitions \nthat were before it, and on July 26, 2024, the court va-\ncated and remanded the denial actions.  Sinclair Wyo-\nming Ref. Co. v. EPA, 114 F.4th 693 (per curiam).  The \ncourt held that EPA had imposed an \u201coverly strict cau-\nsation requirement\u201d in concluding that only dispropor-\ntionate compliance costs could justify granting an ex-\nemption and in failing to consider certain RIN pur-\nchases as a source of disproportionate economic hard-\nship.

Unlike the Fifth Circuit, however, the \nD.C. Circuit declined to address whether EPA\u2019s ap-\nproach was impermissibly retroactive.  Id. at 714 n.12.   \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nUnder the plain terms of Section 7607(b)(1), the de-\nnial actions here are reviewable only in the D.C. Circuit.  \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s contrary decision imposes atextual \nrequirements and fails to give effect to the provision \nCongress enacted.   \nA.  Under Section 7607(b)(1), \u201cnationally applicable\u201d \nEPA final actions are subject to judicial review only in \nthe D.C. Circuit.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  To apply that \nstatutory requirement, courts consider the final action \non its face and determine whether it applies to entities \nlocated throughout the country rather than in a single \nregion.  The denial actions here qualify as \u201cnationally \napplicable\u201d on that basis:  They resolve exemption peti-\ntions from small refineries located in 18 States and eight \nfederal judicial circuits across the country.   \nStatutory context confirms that result.  Section \n7607(b)(1) distinguishes between \u201cnationally applica-\nble\u201d EPA actions, which are subject to review in the \nD.C. Circuit, and \u201clocally or regionally applicable\u201d ac-\ntions, which are subject to review in \u201cthe appropriate \ncircuit.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1) (emphasis added).  Con-\ngress\u2019s use of the definite article indicates that there is \nonly one \u201cappropriate circuit\u201d for review of any partic-\nular \u201clocally or regionally applicable\u201d action.  When an \nEPA action applies to entities in multiple circuits, no \nsingle regional circuit can be identified as \u201cthe\u201d appro-\n\n15 \n \npriate venue, so the action is properly viewed as \u201cna-\ntionally applicable\u201d rather than \u201clocally or regionally \napplicable.\u201d   \nSection 7607(b)(1)\u2019s legislative history reinforces \nthat conclusion.  That history reflects Congress\u2019s un-\nderstanding that any \u201clocally or regionally applicable\u201d \naction could be reviewed in the regional court of appeals \nwhere the affected entity was located.  Where affected \nentities are spread across multiple circuits, however, \nCongress viewed the D.C. Circuit as the proper venue.   \nIn endorsing the contrary conclusion, both the court \nof appeals and respondents go beyond the statutory text \nto impose additional restrictions on the availability of \nD.C. Circuit review.  The court of appeals required that \nthe final action have a prospective effect on future \nagency decisions.  But the court did not ground that re-\nquirement in the statutory text, and respondents do not \ndefend it.  Respondents instead argue that, for venue \npurposes, the Court should treat the denial of each re-\nfinery\u2019s exemption petition as a separate \u201cfinal action.\u201d  \nBut that requirement likewise is untethered to the stat-\nutory text, and this Court has long recognized that \nagencies have discretion to devise their own procedures, \nincluding by aggregating common issues for joint reso-\nlution.  EPA acted reasonably in taking that approach \nhere.  And in determining the proper venue for chal-\nlenges to the agency\u2019s denial actions, the Court should \nfocus on the actions that EPA actually took, rather than \non a hypothetical array of 105 separate, refinery-specific \ndisapprovals. \nB.  Even if this Court finds the denial actions here to \nbe \u201clocally or regionally applicable,\u201d those actions are \nstill subject to review only in the D.C. Circuit because \nthey are \u201cbased on a determination of nationwide scope \n\n16 \n \nor effect,\u201d and EPA published its findings to that effect \nin accordance with Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s requirements.  \n42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).   \nIn requiring a \u201cdetermination of nationwide scope or \neffect,\u201d the statutory text focuses on the underlying \nreasons for EPA\u2019s final action.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  \nThe final action must be \u201cbased on\u201d the relevant deter-\nminations, indicating that the determinations must be a \nbut-for cause of the agency\u2019s final action\u2014forming the \ncore of the agency\u2019s analysis.  And to be nationwide in \nscope or effect, the core justifications for EPA\u2019s final \naction must be intended to govern the agency\u2019s deci-\nsionmaking in actions throughout the country, or have \nlegal consequences for entities beyond a single judicial \ncircuit.   \nThe denial actions here meet those requirements.  \nEPA found that the denial actions were based on two in-\nterrelated determinations of nationwide scope:  (1) EPA\u2019s \nstatutory interpretation that a small refinery\u2019s dispro-\nportionate economic hardship will support an exemp-\ntion only if it is caused by compliance with the RFS pro-\ngram; and (2) EPA\u2019s economic analysis of the national \nmarket for RINs, which found that the cost to acquire \nRINs is the same for refineries everywhere and is \npassed through to consumers in the price of fuels.  Those \ndeterminations apply to all small refinery exemption re-\nquests under the RFS program as a whole, and they \nwere the core rationales for EPA\u2019s denials of the ex-\nemption requests.   \nStatutory history confirms Congress\u2019s intent that \nEPA actions like the denial actions here would be re-\nviewable in the D.C. Circuit.  The original 1970 version \nof the venue provision did not specifically authorize \nD.C. Circuit review of final actions that are based on a \n\n17 \n \ndetermination of nationwide scope or effect.  That stat-\nutory gap led to litigation over which circuit qualified as \n\u201cthe appropriate circuit\u201d when EPA issued an action \nthat established a legal framework for implementation \nplans that spanned multiple States in multiple judicial \ncircuits.  In amending the statute to its current form, \nCongress adopted the view expressed by EPA\u2019s then-\nGeneral Counsel, who urged that challenges to such ac-\ntions should be channeled to the D.C. Circuit to \u201ccen-\ntralize review\u201d and \u201ctak[e] advantage of [the D.C. Cir-\ncuit\u2019s] administrative law expertise,\u201d thereby \u201cfacilitat-\ning an orderly development of the basic law\u201d that EPA \nwould apply nationwide.  41 Fed. Reg. 56,767, 56,769 \n(Dec. 30, 1976).   \nThe court of appeals and respondents have not dis-\nputed that the EPA actions at issue here rested in part \non interpretive and economic determinations having na-\ntionwide scope or effect.  They have observed, however, \nthat EPA also considered refinery-specific facts in rul-\ning on the exemption requests.  But the statute does not \nrequire that the final action be based solely on determi-\nnations of nationwide scope or effect.  Nor would such a \nlimitation make sense.  The third prong of Section \n7607(b)(1) comes into play only when the challenged \nEPA action is \u201clocally or regionally applicable,\u201d and \nsuch actions almost always will rest at least in part on \nconsideration of local or regional circumstances.  42 \nU.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  \nRespondents are also incorrect in asserting that \nEPA\u2019s interpretation would allow for D.C. Circuit venue \nfor challenges to every locally or regionally applicable \naction.  The statute imposes meaningful limits on EPA\u2019s \nauthority to find that a particular action is \u201cbased on a \ndetermination of nationwide scope or effect.\u201d  Courts \n\n18 \n \nshould enforce those limits without adding more of their \nown making.   \nARGUMENT \nTHE D.C. CIRCUIT IS THE APPROPRIATE VENUE FOR \nREVIEW OF THE DENIAL ACTIONS AT ISSUE HERE \nThe CAA\u2019s venue provision reflects a clear congres-\nsional preference for \u201cuniform judicial review of regula-\ntory issues of national importance.\u201d  National Environ-\nmental Development Ass\u2019n Clean Air Project v. EPA, \n891 F.3d 1041, 1054 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (Silberman, J., con-\ncurring).  Section 7607(b)(1) specifies two distinct cir-\ncumstances in which review of nationally significant \nEPA actions will be channeled to the D.C. Circuit.  First, \nany \u201cnationally applicable\u201d final action is subject to re-\nview exclusively in the D.C. Circuit.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  \nSecond, even if a challenged final action is \u201clocally or \nregionally applicable,\u201d venue lies exclusively in the D.C. \nCircuit if that action is \u201cbased on a determination of na-\ntionwide scope or effect and if in taking such action the \nAdministrator finds and publishes that such action is \nbased on such a determination.\u201d  Ibid.   \nBecause the denial actions at issue here resolve the \nexemption petitions of small refineries across the coun-\ntry, those actions are \u201cnationally applicable\u201d within the \nmeaning of Section 7607(b)(1).  In the alternative, if the \nCourt views the denial actions as \u201clocally or regionally \napplicable,\u201d those EPA actions are based on determina-\ntions of nationwide scope because they are grounded in \nEPA\u2019s statutory interpretation and analysis of market-\nplace conditions, both of which apply to all small refin-\nery exemption requests under the RFS program as a \nwhole.  Section 7607(b)(1) thus requires that challenges \nto the denial actions be brought in the D.C. Circuit. \n\n19 \n \nIndeed, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision in this case pro-\nvides a paradigmatic example of the outcome that Sec-\ntion 7607(b)(1) was intended to prevent.  The two EPA \ndenial actions at issue here collectively covered 105 ex-\nemption petitions from 39 small refineries located in \neight different judicial circuits.  The actions were prem-\nised on a statutory interpretation and an economic anal-\nysis that the agency had not previously announced, and \nthat constituted \u201cdetermination[s] of nationwide scope \nor effect\u201d under any reasonable understanding of that \nphrase.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  The ensuing briefing in \nthe court of appeals focused primarily on those nation-\nwide determinations, not on refinery-specific circum-\nstances.  The denial actions thus are precisely the types \nof EPA actions that Congress regarded as appropriate \nfor centralized D.C. Circuit review. \nUnder the Fifth Circuit\u2019s venue analysis, however, \nthe 25 covered refineries that challenged EPA\u2019s denial \nactions in court could have obtained judicial review only \nthrough individual challenges filed in seven different re-\ngional circuits.  That extreme fragmentation was avoided \nhere only because some refineries initially petitioned \nfor review in the D.C. Circuit, and five other regional \ncircuits either dismissed petitions for lack of venue or \ntransferred petitions to that court.  But if this Court en-\ndorses the Fifth Circuit\u2019s venue analysis, future chal-\nlenges to similar EPA actions can be expected to con-\nsume far greater judicial resources, with consequent \nheightened risks of inconsistent outcomes.  Congress \ncrafted Section 7607(b)(1) to avoid that result, and this \nCourt should vacate the court of appeals\u2019 judgment. \nA. The Denial Actions Are Nationally Applicable \nEach of the two denial actions resolved the exemp-\ntion petitions of more than 30 small refineries located in \n\n20 \n \nmultiple judicial circuits across the country.  It there-\nfore is apparent on the face of the final actions that they \nare \u201cnationally applicable\u201d and subject to review in the \nD.C. Circuit.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  The contrary argu-\nments advanced by the court of appeals and respond-\nents do not contest the reach of the two denial actions \nEPA issued, but instead advocate additional limitations \nthat the statutory text does not impose.   \n1.  The text, context, and history of Section 7607(b)(1) \nmake clear that the denial actions are nationally ap-\nplicable  \nSection 7607(b)(1) instructs that a challenge to a \u201cfi-\nnal action\u201d that is \u201cnationally applicable\u201d must be heard \nin the D.C. Circuit.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  That language \nencompasses the denial actions at issue here because \nthose actions apply to small refineries in multiple judi-\ncial circuits throughout the country.  The statutory con-\ntext and history confirm Congress\u2019s intent that the D.C. \nCircuit would review challenges to such actions.   \na. Under the text of Section 7607(b)(1), the proper \nvenue for challenges to EPA\u2019s implementation of the \nCAA depends on the \u201cfinal action\u201d that is being chal-\nlenged.  The term \u201caction\u201d in Section 7607(b)(1) \u201cis \nmeant to cover comprehensively every manner in which \nan agency may exercise its power.\u201d  Whitman v. Amer-\nican Trucking Ass\u2019ns, 531 U.S. 457, 478 (2001).  And as \nnumerous courts of appeals have recognized, the statu-\ntory text makes clear that venue turns on the nature of \nthe pertinent EPA action rather than on the basis for a \nparticular petitioner\u2019s challenge.  See, e.g., Hunt Ref. \nCo. v. EPA, 90 F.4th 1107, 1110 (11th Cir. 2024); South-\nern Ill. Power Coop. v. EPA, 863 F.3d 666, 671 (7th Cir. \n2017); American Road & Transp. Builders Ass\u2019n v. \nEPA, 705 F.3d 453, 455 (D.C. Cir. 2013), cert. denied, \n\n21 \n \n571 U.S. 1125 (2014); ATK Launch Sys., Inc. v. EPA, \n651 F.3d 1194, 1197 (10th Cir. 2011).  Courts thus must \nlook to the face of the action and determine whether it \napplies to\u2014or includes \u201cwithin its scope,\u201d Black\u2019s Law \nDictionary 91 (5th ed. 1979) (Black\u2019s) (defining \u201cap-\nply\u201d)\u2014entities \u201cthroughout [the] nation,\u201d Webster\u2019s \nThird New International Dictionary of the English \nLanguage 1505 (1976) (Webster\u2019s) (defining \u201cnation-\nally\u201d).     \nStatutory context sheds further light on what geo-\ngraphic scope an action must have to be \u201cnationally ap-\nplicable.\u201d  Under Section 7607(b)(1), each EPA action is \neither \u201cnationally applicable\u201d or \u201clocally or regionally \napplicable.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  In distinguishing be-\ntween those two types of actions, \u201c[t]he text of the stat-\nute leaves no room for an intermediate case.\u201d  Southern \nIll. Power Coop., 863 F.3d at 673.  If the challenged ac-\ntion is \u201cnationally applicable,\u201d the D.C. Circuit is the ex-\nclusive forum for judicial review.  And unless a \u201clocally \nor regionally applicable\u201d action is \u201cbased on a determi-\nnation of nationwide scope or effect,\u201d it may be chal-\nlenged \u201conly in the United States Court of Appeals for \nthe appropriate circuit.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  The stat-\nute\u2019s use of the definite article\u2014\u201cthe appropriate cir-\ncuit,\u201d ibid. (emphasis added)\u2014indicates that, for any \ngiven locally or regionally applicable EPA action, there \nis only one appropriate regional court of appeals in \nwhich to seek review.  Cf.

Padilla, 542 U.S. \n426, 434 (2004) (explaining that the \u201cuse of the definite \narticle\u201d in the federal habeas statute \u201cindicates that \n\n22 \n \nthere is generally only one proper respondent to a given \nprisoner\u2019s habeas petition\u201d).4 \nThe existence of a single appropriate court of ap-\npeals for this category of EPA actions in turn conveys \nthat a particular action is \u201clocally or regionally applica-\nble\u201d only if it applies to entities that are confined to a \nsingle judicial circuit.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  After all, \nfor an action that applies equally to entities in more \nthan one judicial circuit, no particular court of appeals \ncan be identified as \u201cthe appropriate circuit\u201d for review.  \nIbid. (emphasis added).  Thus, any action that spans \nmore than one judicial circuit is properly viewed as \u201cna-\ntionally applicable\u201d and subject to review only in the \nD.C. Circuit.  Ibid.   \nb. The history of Section 7607(b)(1) reflects the \nsame understanding.  As originally enacted in 1970, the \nCAA venue provision stated that any action \u201cpromul-\ngating any national primary or secondary ambient air \nquality standard,\u201d \u201cemission standard,\u201d \u201cstandard of \nperformance,\u201d or other specified standards or controls, \nwould be reviewable only in the D.C. Circuit.  42 U.S.C. \n1857h-5(b)(1) (1970).  The provision further specified \nthat any action \u201capproving or promulgating any imple-\nmentation plan\u201d could be reviewed only in \u201cthe appro-\npriate circuit.\u201d  Ibid.  Because that venue provision did \nnot specify the proper court for review of the many EPA \nactions that did not fall within any of the enumerated \ncategories, such actions were reviewable only by dis-\n \n4  Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s reference to \u201cthe appropriate circuit,\u201d 42 \nU.S.C. 7607(b)(1) (emphasis added), contrasts with the preceding \nsubsection, where Congress contemplated the prospect of multiple \npermissible forums by authorizing \u201cthe district court  * * *  for any \ndistrict in which such person is found or resides or transacts busi-\nness\u201d to issue certain orders, 42 U.S.C. 7607(a) (emphasis added). \n\n23 \n \ntrict courts exercising federal-question jurisdiction.  \nSee p. 3, supra.   \nThe actions that Congress specified for D.C. Circuit \nreview in the 1970 statute were all \u201cnational in scope,\u201d \nand Congress sought to ensure that they received \u201ceven \nand consistent national application\u201d through centralized \nreview.  1970 Senate Report 41.  By contrast, Congress \nviewed EPA actions approving or promulgating \u201cimple-\nmentation plans which run only to one air quality con-\ntrol region\u201d as amenable to review \u201cin the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Circuit in which the affected air quality \ncontrol region, or portion thereof, is located,\u201d ibid., \nwhich the statute referred to as \u201cthe appropriate cir-\ncuit,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 1857h-5(b)(1) (1970).   \nWhen Congress amended the statute in 1977 to ex-\npand the scope of direct court of appeals review, it \nadopted the same understanding of the limited geo-\ngraphic scope of actions that would be subject to review \nin \u201cthe appropriate circuit.\u201d  The 1977 House Report ex-\nplained that the revision would \u201cprovide[] for essen-\ntially locally, statewide, or regionally applicable rules or \norders to be reviewed in the U.S. court of appeals for \nthe circuit in which such locality, State, or region is lo-\ncated.\u201d  1977 House Report 323.  And the House Report \ncontrasted such local actions with nationally relevant \nactions that extend \u201cbeyond a single judicial circuit\u201d \nand therefore should be subject to centralized D.C. Cir-\ncuit review.  Id. at 324.  That history reinforces the con-\nclusion that, under the venue provision in its current \nform, final EPA actions that apply to entities in multiple \njudicial circuits are reviewable only in the D.C. Circuit.   \nc. Applying that understanding here, the denial ac-\ntions are nationally applicable.  EPA \u201cexercise[d] its \npower\u201d through two final denial actions, each of which \n\n24 \n \napplies to multiple entities located throughout the coun-\ntry in multiple federal judicial circuits.  Whitman, 531 \nU.S. at 478.  The April 2022 denial action covers \u201c36  \n* * *  petitions for exemptions from the RFS program \nfor over 30 small refineries across the country and ap-\nplies to small refineries located within 18 states in 7 of \nthe 10 EPA regions and in 8 different federal judicial \ncircuits.\u201d  Pet. App. 329a.  The June 2022 denial action \ncovers \u201c69 petitions for exemptions from the RFS pro-\ngram for over 30 small refineries across the country and \napplies to small refineries located within 15 states in 7 \nof the 10 EPA regions and in 8 different Federal judicial \ncircuits.\u201d  Id. at 187a.  On a plain-text understanding, \neach of the two denial actions is therefore \u201cnationally \napplicable,\u201d and respondents\u2019 challenges to those ac-\ntions can proceed only in the D.C. Circuit.  42 U.S.C. \n7607(b)(1); see Hunt Ref. Co., 90 F.4th at 1110.   \n2.  The court of appeals\u2019 and respondents\u2019 contrary rea-\nsoning is inconsistent with the statutory text  \nNeither the court of appeals nor respondents have \ndisputed that the denial actions at issue here apply to \nsmall refineries in multiple judicial circuits across the \ncountry.  Nor have they disputed the general proposi-\ntion that, when an EPA final action applies to entities in \nmultiple judicial circuits, that action is \u201cnationally ap-\nplicable\u201d within the meaning of Section 7607(b)(1).  The \ncourt of appeals nevertheless held that the denial ac-\ntions are not \u201cnationally applicable\u201d because those ac-\ntions apply only to the specific refineries whose exemp-\ntion petitions EPA adjudicated, and those adjudications \nwill not bind the agency in any future proceeding.  Re-\nspondents have not endorsed that rationale, but have \nargued instead that the denial actions should be viewed \nfor venue purposes as 105 separate denials of 105 ex-\n\n25 \n \nemption petitions, each of which is confined to a single \njudicial circuit.  Those arguments lack merit. \na. The court of appeals found it significant that the \ndenial actions apply only to the petitioning refineries \nand do not \u201cbind[] EPA in any future adjudication.\u201d  \nPet. App. 12a.  But the court did not attempt to tether \nthat observation to the statutory text.  And nothing in \nSection 7607(b)(1) suggests that a final action must bind \nEPA prospectively in order to be considered \u201cnationally \napplicable.\u201d  The court of appeals erred by effectively \n\u201cadd[ing] words  * * *  to the statute Congress enacted\u201d \nand \u201cimpos[ing] a new requirement\u201d that atextually lim-\nits the category of actions encompassed within Section \n7607(b)(1)\u2019s first category.  Muldrow v. City of St. \nLouis, 601 U.S. 346, 355 (2024).   \nIndeed, under the court of appeals\u2019 approach, virtu-\nally no adjudicatory actions would be deemed \u201cnation-\nally applicable\u201d because agency adjudications typically \n\u201clack \u2018legal effect\u2019 beyond the parties involved.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 39a (Higginbotham, J., dissenting).  But the venue \nprovision at issue here refers broadly to \u201cany other na-\ntionally applicable regulations promulgated, or final ac-\ntion taken.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1) (emphasis added).  \nSuch \u201cexpansive language\u201d is not amenable to the kind \nof \u201climiting construction\u201d the court of appeals\u2019 analysis \nwould impose.  Harrison v. PPG Industries, Inc., 446 \nU.S. 578, 589 (1980); see Whitman, 531 U.S. at 478.  \nElsewhere in Section 7607(b)(1), Congress distinguished \namong particular agency actions by referring specifi-\ncally to a \u201cregulation[]\u201d or \u201corder.\u201d  42 U.S.C 7607(b)(1).  \nIn contrast, Congress\u2019s reference to \u201cany other nation-\nally applicable  * * *  final action\u201d should be given its \nnatural meaning rather than subjected to artificial con-\nstraints.  Ibid.; cf. Nielsen v. Preap, 586 U.S. 392, 414 \n\n26 \n \n(2019) (presuming that \u201cevery word and every provi-\nsion\u201d in a statute \u201cis to be given effect\u201d) (citation omit-\nted).   \nb. Respondents do not defend the court of appeals\u2019 \nreliance on the adjudicative character of the denial ac-\ntions.  Instead, respondents contend (Br. in Opp. 17-21) \nthat, for purposes of the venue provision, the relevant \n\u201cfinal action[s]\u201d are not the two denial actions issued in \nApril and June of 2022, but rather 105 separate denials \nof the various petitioning refineries\u2019 exemption re-\nquests.  That is incorrect.   \nRespondents argue that here, \u201c[t]he final EPA action \n\u2018under\u2019 the CAA is EPA\u2019s adjudication of individual \nhardship petitions.\u201d  Br. in Opp. 18.  Respondents high-\nlight the fact that Section 7545(o)(9)(B) allows \u201ca small \nrefinery\u201d to petition for an exemption and requires EPA \nto \u201cevaluat[e] a petition.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(B) (em-\nphases added).  But neither that CAA provision nor any \nother restricts EPA\u2019s ability to consider petitions to-\ngether and resolve common issues in a single action.  \nThe court of appeals recognized that \u201c[w]ithout more,\u201d \nthe use of \u201can indefinite article immediately followed \nwith a singular noun\u201d does not \u201cshow that the relevant \nstatutory provisions require EPA to consider exemp-\ntion petitions individually.\u201d  Pet. App. 29a.   \nThe Dictionary Act, ch. 71, 16 Stat. 431, instructs \nthat, \u201cunless the context indicates otherwise[,] words \nimporting the singular include and apply to several per-\nsons, parties, or things.\u201d  1 U.S.C. 1.  Here, the context \nprovides no reason to doubt that EPA may evaluate \nmultiple petitions in a single action.  Indeed, this Court \nhas long recognized that administrative agencies \n\u201cshould be free to fashion their own rules of procedure \nand to pursue methods of inquiry capable of permitting \n\n27 \n \nthem to discharge their multitudinous duties.\u201d  FCC v. \nPottsville Broadcasting Co., 309 U.S. 134, 143 (1940); \nsee Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural \nResources Defense Council, 435 U.S. 519, 524 (1978) \n(\u201c[T]his Court has for more than four decades empha-\nsized that the formulation of procedures was basically \nto be left within the discretion of the agencies to which \nCongress had confided the responsibility for substan-\ntive judgments.\u201d).  That discretion includes the ability \nto determine \u201cwhether applications should be heard \ncontemporaneously or successively.\u201d  Pottsville, 309 \nU.S. at 138.  Section 7545(o)(9)(B)\u2019s use of an indefinite \narticle is an insufficient basis for inferring any con-\nstraint on EPA\u2019s discretion to aggregate similar peti-\ntions for joint resolution.    \nThere is nothing unusual or problematic about EPA\u2019s \ndecision to group the various exemption petitions to de-\ncide the common issues that affect refineries across the \ncountry.  That approach aligns with Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s \naim to promote national uniformity and with EPA\u2019s \nlongstanding practice of resolving similar issues in a \nsingle action to ensure consistent treatment.  See ATK \nLaunch Sys., 651 F.3d at 1197 (single EPA action prom-\nulgating air quality designations for 31 areas across 18 \nStates); RMS of Ga., LLC v. EPA, 64 F.4th 1368, 1371 \n(11th Cir. 2023) (single EPA action adjudicating allow-\nance requests and issuing allowances to 32 entities to \nconsume hydrofluorocarbons); West Virginia Chamber \nof Commerce v. Browner, 166 F.3d 336 (4th Cir. 1998) \n(Tbl.) (per curiam) (single EPA action declaring that 22 \nStates\u2019 implementation plans were inadequate and re-\nquired revisions).  Indeed, such aggregation generally \nis encouraged as a means of efficiently adjudicating \ncommon issues.  See Committee on Adjudication, Ad-\n\n28 \n \nministrative Conference of the United States, Aggrega-\ntion of Similar Claims in Agency Adjudication (June \n13, 2016), https://perma.cc/2UQS-TJ6F. \nEPA\u2019s approach was particularly sensible here.  \nEPA was considering the exemption petitions in light of \nthis Court\u2019s decision in HollyFrontier, and in light of \nthe Tenth Circuit\u2019s reasoning in Renewable Fuels Asso-\nciation on issues this Court had not addressed.  See pp. \n6-7, supra.  EPA grouped the petitions together for res-\nolution in order to \u201capply one consistent statutory in-\nterpretation and economic analysis to thirty-six small \nrefineries, located in eighteen different states, in the ge-\nographical boundaries of eight different circuit courts.\u201d  \nPet. App. 38a (Higginbotham, J., dissenting); see also \npp. 7-8, supra.   \nIn making prior exemption decisions, EPA has some-\ntimes declined to group multiple petitions for resolution \nin a single action because the agency concluded that the \ncircumstances did not call for such treatment.  When \nEPA has issued decisions on petitions from individual \nsmall refineries, EPA has recognized that the actions \nare locally or regionally applicable.  See, e.g., Producers \nof Renewables United for Integrity Truth & Transpar-\nency v. EPA, No. 18-1202, Doc. 1775897 (D.C. Cir. Mar. \n4, 2019).  But whichever course EPA chooses in a par-\nticular instance, it is the face of the final action that de-\ntermines the proper venue.  \nRespondents\u2019 position would require the court where \na petition for review is filed to look behind EPA\u2019s char-\nacterization of its own agency action and potentially \nsubstitute a judicial determination of the relevant unit \nof analysis.  But respondents provide little guidance on \nhow courts would make that determination.  Lower \ncourts confronted with such arguments have generally \n\n29 \n \nrejected requests to second-guess EPA\u2019s own framing \nand have focused solely on the face of the final agency \naction.  See, e.g., Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. EPA, 45 F.4th \n380, 387 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (rejecting petitioner\u2019s argu-\nment that EPA\u2019s construction and application to a spe-\ncific context of \u201cnationally applicable provisions of the \nClean Air Act\u201d rendered the agency action itself nation-\nally applicable); Sierra Club v. EPA, 47 F.4th 738, 744 \n(D.C. Cir. 2022) (rejecting petitioner\u2019s argument that \nEPA\u2019s approvals of Texas\u2019s state implementation plans \nwere nationally applicable because EPA had announced \na new understanding that would apply in other loca-\ntions, thereby \u201ceffectively amend[ing] the agency\u2019s na-\ntional implementation regulations\u201d); Southern Ill. Power \nCoop., 863 F.3d at 671 (rejecting petitioner\u2019s argument \nthat EPA\u2019s designations of nonattainment areas were \nan \u201camalgamation of many different locally or region-\nally applicable actions\u201d); RMS of Ga., 64 F.4th at 1374 \n(rejecting petitioner\u2019s argument that an allocation of al-\nlowances among entities should be considered a \u201cdocu-\nment detailing many smaller individual actions\u201d).   \nFocusing on the face of the EPA action has allowed \ncourts and litigants to quickly and efficiently determine \nwhere venue lies, preventing wasteful expenditure of \nresources resolving threshold issues, and furthering \nSection 7607(b)(1)\u2019s purpose of \u201cprioritiz[ing] efficiency.\u201d  \nNational Ass\u2019n of Mfrs. v. Department of Defense, 583 \nU.S. 109, 130 (2018).  Respondents\u2019 approach, by con-\ntrast, would \u201cintroduce[] needless uncertainty into the \ndetermination of venue, where the need for clear rules \nis especially acute.\u201d  Southern Ill. Power Coop., 863 F.3d \nat 673.   \n\n30 \n \nB. The Denial Actions At Issue Here Are Based On Deter-\nminations Of Nationwide Scope Or Effect \nEven if the Court concludes that EPA\u2019s denial ac-\ntions here are \u201clocally or regionally applicable,\u201d those \nactions still are reviewable exclusively in the D.C. Cir-\ncuit.  Those actions are \u201cbased on a determination of na-\ntionwide scope or effect,\u201d and EPA published findings \nto that effect.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).   \n1.  The denial actions at issue here were based on deter-\nminations of nationwide scope \nUnder Section 7607(b)(1), a final action that is \u201clo-\ncally or regionally applicable\u201d is nonetheless reviewable \nin the D.C. Circuit if it is \u201cbased on a determination of \nnationwide scope or effect, and if in taking such action \nthe Administrator finds and publishes that such action \nis based on such a determination.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  \nThere is no dispute that EPA published the requisite \nfindings.  See Pet. App. 12a-13a; see also April Notice, \n87 Fed. Reg. at 24,301; June Notice, 87 Fed. Reg. at \n34,874.  Those findings were correct.   \na. A \u201cdetermination\u201d is a \u201cdecision arrived at or \npromulgated; a determinate sentence, conclusion, or \nopinion.\u201d  4 The Oxford English Dictionary 548 (2d ed. \n1989) (OED); see Webster\u2019s 616 (\u201cthe settling and end-\ning of a controversy esp. by judicial decision\u201d; \u201cthe re-\nsolving of a question by argument or reasoning\u201d).  The \ntext of Section 7607(b)(1) distinguishes between the \nagency\u2019s \u201cfinal action\u201d and the relevant underlying \u201cde-\ntermination.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  A particular EPA \naction may reflect multiple agency determinations, but \nby referring to \u201ca determination of nationwide scope or \neffect,\u201d Section 7607(b)(1) authorizes D.C. Circuit venue \n(if EPA publishes the requisite finding) so long as any \n\n31 \n \nsingle determination of that kind forms the basis of the \naction.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1) (emphasis added).   \nRequiring that the action be \u201c\u200a\u2018based on\u2019\u200a\u201d the rele-\nvant determination ordinarily \u201cindicates a but-for causal \nrelationship and thus a necessary logical condition.\u201d  \nSafeco Ins. Co. of Am. v. Burr, 551 U.S. 47, 63 (2007).  \nEPA\u2019s actions may be\u2014and frequently are\u2014based on \nmultiple determinations, and courts have long accepted \nsuch independent causes as adequate.  See Bostock v. \nClayton County, 590 U.S. 644, 656 (2020) (noting that \n\u201c[o]ften, events have multiple but-for causes\u201d that can \nbe sufficient to trigger liability).  Under \u201cthe traditional \nbut-for causation standard,\u201d causation cannot be de-\nfeated \u201cjust by citing some other factor that contributed \nto [the] challenged  * * *  decision.\u201d  Ibid.  \u201cSo long as\u201d \nthe relevant determination \u201cwas one but-for cause of \nth[e] decision, that is enough to trigger the law.\u201d  Ibid.  \nThus, under Section 7607(b)(1), the relevant determina-\ntions must \u201clie at the core of the agency action\u201d and can-\nnot be \u201c[m]erely peripheral or extraneous.\u201d  Texas v. \nEPA, 829 F.3d 405, 419 (5th Cir. 2016).   \nSection 7607(b)(1) further provides that venue may \nbe appropriate in the D.C. Circuit when the relevant de-\ntermination has \u201cnationwide scope or effect.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n7607(b)(1) (emphasis added).  \u201cScope\u201d means \u201cthe gen-\neral range or extent of cognizance, consideration, activ-\nity, or influence.\u201d  Webster\u2019s 2035; see 14 OED 672 \n(\u201c[R]ange of application or of subjects embraced.\u201d).  \n\u201cEffect\u201d generally means \u201csomething that is produced \nby an agent or cause.\u201d  Webster\u2019s 724; see 5 OED 79 (\u201cTo \nbring about\u201d; \u201cto accomplish\u201d).  When used with respect \nto a statute, \u201ceffect\u201d refers to \u201c[t]he result  * * *  which \na statute will produce upon the existing law.\u201d  Black\u2019s \n462.  Applying that definition in the context of agency \n\n32 \n \naction, the \u201ceffect\u201d of an agency determination refers to \nthe legal consequences that determination produces.  \nThus, Section 7607(b)(1) allows for D.C. Circuit review \nwhen EPA\u2019s final action sets out as a core justification \na principle or conclusion that is intended to govern the \nagency\u2019s decisionmaking in actions throughout the coun-\ntry, or when a central rationale for EPA\u2019s final action \nhas legal consequences for entities beyond a single ju-\ndicial circuit.   \nUnder the third prong of Section 7607(b)(1), a locally \nor regionally applicable action is reviewable in the D.C. \nCircuit only if (a) the action \u201cis based on a determina-\ntion of nationwide scope or effect\u201d and (b) EPA \u201cfinds \nand publishes that such action is based on such a deter-\nmination.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  When EPA publishes \nthe specified finding, a person who seeks review of the \npertinent EPA action may argue that the finding is in-\ncorrect and that venue therefore lies in a regional cir-\ncuit.  In such cases, any disputes about the meaning of \nthe phrase \u201cdetermination of nationwide scope or ef-\nfect\u201d will present questions of statutory interpretation \nthat courts must decide de novo.  See Loper Bright En-\nterprises v. Raimondo, 144 S. Ct. 2244, 2266 (2024).  But \nEPA\u2019s finding that the statutory standard is satisfied \nwith respect to a particular final action ordinarily will be \ngoverned by the arbitrary-and-capricious standard.  See \n5 U.S.C. 706(2)(A) (requiring application of arbitrary-\nand-capricious standard to \u201cagency action, findings, and \nconclusions\u201d); cf. 42 U.S.C. 7607(d)(9) (requiring appli-\ncation of arbitrary-and-capricious standard to particu-\nlar EPA actions).  That deferential standard of review \naccounts for the fact that EPA has obvious knowledge \nand expertise with respect to the centrality of the rele-\nvant \u201cdetermination\u201d to the agency\u2019s own decisionmaking \n\n33 \n \nprocess.  See Marsh v. Oregon Natural Resources Coun-\ncil, 490 U.S. 360, 376-377 (1989) (applying arbitrary-and-\ncapricious review to a \u201cfactual dispute\u201d as to whether \n\u201cnew information undermines conclusions\u201d the agency \nreached because such a question \u201cimplicates substantial \nagency expertise\u201d). \nBy contrast, nothing in the statute requires EPA to \n\u201cfind[] and publish[] that [an] action is based on  * * *  a \ndetermination\u201d of nationwide scope or effect, 42 U.S.C. \n7607(b)(1), even when the facts and law would support \nsuch a finding.  Rather, when EPA declines to publish \nsuch a finding, that decision \u201cis committed to the agency\u2019s \ndiscretion and thus is unreviewable,\u201d Sierra Club, 47 \nF.4th at 745, and it effectively precludes D.C. Circuit \nvenue under Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s third prong.  Thus, for \nany locally or regionally applicable action that is based \non a determination of nationwide scope or effect, Con-\ngress \u201centrusted EPA with discretion to determine the \nproper venue as the agency sees fit.\u201d  Id. at 746; accord \nTexas v. EPA, 983 F.3d 826, 834-835 (5th Cir. 2020).  If \nEPA concludes that a regional circuit is \u201cbest equipped \nto evaluate\u201d a particular agency action based on \u201clocal \nmarket conditions,\u201d Br. in Opp. 21, EPA may decline to \npublish the relevant finding, thereby ensuring that the \nregional circuit will have venue over any challenge to \nthe action. \nb. As EPA correctly found, the denial actions at is-\nsue here were \u201cbased on\u201d two interrelated \u201cdetermina-\ntion[s] of nationwide scope.\u201d  See April Notice, 87 Fed. \nReg. at 24,301; June Notice, 87 Fed. Reg. at 34,874.  \nFirst, the agency adopted a new interpretation of 42 \nU.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(B), construing that provision to re-\nquire that any qualifying hardship \u201cmust be caused by \ncompliance with the RFS program\u201d rather than by \n\n34 \n \nsome unrelated circumstance.

Second, EPA deter-\nmined, as a matter of economic reality, that every refin-\nery recovers the cost of the RIN at the time it sells a \ngallon of fuel.  See id. at 249a.  And because the \u201crefin-\ning and fuel blending markets are highly competitive,\u201d \nEPA found that \u201cRINs are generally widely available in \nan open and liquid market,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he cost of ac-\nquiring RINs is the same for all parties\u201d\u2014features that \n\u201cfacilitate the RIN cost passthrough.\u201d  Ibid.  In light of \nthose two determinations, EPA concluded that, absent \nunusual circumstances, compliance with the RFS pro-\ngram cannot cause disproportionate economic hardship \nto small refineries.   \nAs an interpretation of the statute and an analysis of \nthe national fuels and RIN markets that govern all \nsmall refineries throughout the country seeking exemp-\ntions from the RFS program, EPA\u2019s determinations are \n\u201cnationwide\u201d in scope.  Pet. App. 327a-328a.  That EPA \nadopted and applied those determinations uniformly to \nsmall refineries across the country is evidence of that \nfact.  Those core determinations played a decisive role \nin EPA\u2019s denial actions, leading EPA to presume that \nthe petitioning small refineries across the country had \nnot experienced disproportionate economic hardship\u2014\na presumption that EPA concluded no individual refin-\neries had succeeded in rebutting.  See id. at 15a.  And \nthose determinations were essential to the validity of \nthe challenged denial actions, such that judicial rejec-\ntion of either determination would provide a sufficient \nbasis for reversing the actions.5 \n \n5  Under the RFS program, EPA establishes percentage stand-\nards each year that all obligated parties must use to satisfy their \n \n\n35 \n \nIndeed, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s ultimate merits disposi-\ntion of the petitions for review here confirms that the \nchallenged denial actions were \u201cbased on\u201d the statutory \ninterpretation and economic analysis described above.  \nIn this case the Fifth Circuit, having concluded that \nEPA\u2019s statutory interpretation was inconsistent with \nthe CAA\u2019s text (Pet. App. 23a-27a) and that \u201cEPA\u2019s \nRIN-passthrough theory [was] contrary to the evi-\ndence\u201d (id. at 30a; see id. at 29a-33a), granted the peti-\ntions for review and vacated the denial actions.  See id. \nat 34a.  If judicial invalidation of the relevant determi-\nnation would provide a sufficient basis for finding the \nfinal action itself to be \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse \nof discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,\u201d \n42 U.S.C. 7607(d)(9)(A); 5 U.S.C. 706(2), then the deter-\nmination is properly viewed as \u201ca necessary logical con-\ndition\u201d of the action, Safeco, 551 U.S. at 63, and the req-\nuisite causal relationship exists.  \nc. The statutory history confirms that Congress in-\ntended for final actions like those at issue here to be \nsubject to review in the D.C. Circuit.   \n \nportion of the nationwide target volumes, see p. 4, supra.  When \nEPA anticipates granting an exemption petition at the time it estab-\nlishes the percentage standard, it accounts for that exemption by \nshifting the pro rata burden to other obligated parties.  See Pet. \nApp. 248a & n.139.  If EPA later grants an exemption it did not an-\nticipate, the result is that the national target volumes will not be \nreached for that year.  See id. at 246a & n.135.  EPA\u2019s exemption \ndecisions thus implicate the legal obligations of all non-exempt re-\nfineries across the country.  That reality further underscores the \nneed for nationwide uniformity, and thus the appropriateness of \nD.C. Circuit review, which ensures that uniform standards will ap-\nply and that no refinery will receive a competitive advantage based \non the happenstance of the circuit in which it is located. \n\n36 \n \nBefore Congress amended the venue provision to au-\nthorize D.C. Circuit review of locally or regionally ap-\nplicable actions with nationwide scope or effect, the \n1970 statute made the approval or promulgation of state \nor federal plans reviewable in \u201cthe appropriate circuit.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. 1857h-5(b)(1) (1970).  Disputes concerning \nthat language spawned protracted litigation.  See David \nP. Currie, Judicial Review Under Federal Pollution \nLaws, 62 Iowa L. Rev. 1221, 1262-1269 (1977) (Currie).  \nParties faced a lack of clarity as to which circuit was \n\u201cthe appropriate circuit\u201d when a petitioner challenged a \nfinal action pertaining to state implementation plans \nsubmitted by multiple states spanning multiple judicial \ncircuits.  Id. at 1264.   \nIn light of that uncertainty, one petitioner filed iden-\ntical petitions in ten regional circuits, with an eleventh \nin the D.C. Circuit, and then asked each of the regional \ncircuits to transfer the case to the D.C. Circuit for res-\nolution.  Currie 1263.  Five courts of appeals agreed to \ndo so, while the other five stayed proceedings pending \nthe disposition of the D.C. Circuit case.  Ibid.  Each of \nthe petitions challenged an EPA action that had ap-\nproved numerous state implementation plans based on \nthe agency\u2019s determination that the attainment dead-\nlines for certain pollutants should be extended because \nnecessary control measures would not be available in \nthe time otherwise prescribed.  See Natural Resources \nDefense Council v. EPA, 475 F.2d 968, 969-970 (D.C. \nCir. 1973) (per curiam). \nIn an opinion approving a transfer and finding the \nD.C. Circuit to be \u201cthe appropriate circuit,\u201d the First \nCircuit explained that \u201c[t]he legal issues raised by peti-\ntioners in the\u201d various pending cases \u201cseem[ed] to be \nidentical,\u201d and that \u201clitigation in several circuits, with \n\n37 \n \npossible delayed results on the merits, can only serve to \nfrustrate the strong Congressional interest in improv-\ning the environment.\u201d  Natural Resources Defense \nCouncil v. EPA, 465 F.2d 492, 494 (1st Cir. 1972) (per \ncuriam).  The D.C. Circuit agreed, explaining that \n\u201c[n]one of the[] issues\u201d raised by the petitions \u201cinvolve \nfacts or laws peculiar to any one jurisdiction; rather, all \nconcern uniform determinations of nationwide effect \nmade by the Administrator.\u201d  Natural Resources De-\nfense Council, 475 F.2d at 970.   \nIn 1976, the Administrative Conference of the United \nStates (ACUS) drafted recommendations for amending \nand clarifying the CAA venue provision.  41 Fed. Reg. \nat 56,767.  ACUS urged Congress to \u201cclarify[] that the \nappropriate circuit is the one containing the state whose \nplan is challenged.\u201d  Ibid.  EPA General Counsel G. Wil-\nliam Frick provided additional views, however, and \ncounseled that \u201cwhere \u2018national issues\u2019 are involved \nthey should be reviewed in the D.C. Circuit.\u201d  Id. at \n56,768.  Frick noted that, although EPA actions involv-\ning state implementation plans \u201cusually involve issues \npeculiar to the affected States, such actions sometimes \ninvolve generic determinations of nationwide scope or \neffect.\u201d  Id. at 56,768-56,769.  In Frick\u2019s view, \u201cCongress \nintended review in the D.C. Circuit of \u2018matters on which \nnational uniformity is desirable\u2019\u200a\u201d because of \u201cthe D.C. \nCircuit\u2019s obvious expertise in administrative law mat-\nters\u201d and its familiarity with the CAA\u2019s \u201ccomplex\u201d text \nand history.  Id. at 56,769.  Citing the Natural Re-\nsources Defense Council cases as illustrative, Frick ex-\nplained that it \u201cmakes sense to centralize review of \u2018na-\ntional\u2019 [state implementation plan] issues in the D.C. \nCircuit, taking advantage of its administrative law ex-\npertise and facilitating an orderly development of the \n\n38 \n \nbasic law under the Act, rather than to have such issues \ndecided separately by a number of courts.\u201d  Ibid. \nBy authorizing D.C. Circuit review of final EPA ac-\ntions that are based on \u201cdetermination[s] of nationwide \nscope or effect,\u201d the 1977 amendments incorporated \nFrick\u2019s own language.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1); see 41 Fed. \nReg. at 56,768-56,769.  The House Report that accompa-\nnied the 1977 amendments \u201cconcur[red]\u201d with Frick\u2019s \n\u201ccomments, concerns, and recommendation.\u201d  1977 House \nReport 324.  That history reflects Congress\u2019s awareness \nthat, even when a particular EPA action specifically ad-\ndresses a single State, region, or entity, judicial review \nof the action may implicate national concerns.  After \nconsidering the competing viewpoints expressed by \nACUS and Frick as to the proper means of resolving \nthose national issues, Congress opted to authorize uni-\nform resolution by providing a mechanism for exclusive \nD.C. Circuit review.  \n2.  The court of appeals\u2019 and respondents\u2019 contrary rea-\nsoning would render the \u201cnationwide scope or effect\u201d \nprong of Section 7607(b)(1) practically insignificant \nThe court of appeals and respondents have largely \nignored the determinations of nationwide scope or ef-\nfect that EPA identified.  The court and respondents \nhave focused instead on the refinery-specific circum-\nstances that EPA also considered in the course of de-\ntermining whether individual refineries could rebut the \npresumption the agency had established.  That myopic \napproach is inconsistent with the statutory text and \nwould severely undercut the intended reach of the third \nprong of Section 7607(b)(1).  Under the correct inter-\npretation of the statute, that prong has both meaningful \nreach and meaningful limits, each designed to further \nCongress\u2019s purpose of channeling to the D.C. Circuit \n\n39 \n \nthose challenges that are likely to raise issues of na-\ntional importance.   \na. The Fifth Circuit erred in rejecting EPA\u2019s finding \nthat the denial actions are based on determinations of \nnationwide scope or effect.  The court stated that EPA\u2019s \nstatutory interpretation and economic analysis\u2014\u201cwithout \nmore\u201d\u2014\u201cfail to provide the agency with a sufficient ba-\nsis to adjudicate exemption petitions.\u201d  Pet. App. 15a.  \nThe court observed that, in ruling on a specific exemp-\ntion request, EPA must examine \u201crefinery-specific\u201d \nfacts to ensure that local circumstances do not warrant \na departure from the agency\u2019s general economic analy-\nsis.  Ibid.  Respondents likewise emphasize (Br. in Opp. \n23) that EPA considered \u201clocal facts and data\u201d in deter-\nmining that the refineries\u2019 exemption requests should \nbe denied. \nIn treating that aspect of EPA\u2019s methodology as de-\ncisive, the court and respondents would effectively limit \nD.C. Circuit venue under Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s third \nprong to review of EPA actions that are based solely on \ndeterminations of nationwide scope or effect.  Nothing \nin the statutory text supports that approach.  Where \nCongress intended to require such a limitation, it said \nso explicitly.  See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1) (providing \nan exception to the statute\u2019s 60-day filing window where \nthe \u201cpetition is based solely on grounds arising after\u201d \nthat time period expires) (emphasis added); cf. Bostock, \n590 U.S. at 656 (\u201cAs it has in other statutes, [Congress] \ncould have added \u2018solely\u2019 to indicate that actions taken \n\u2018because of\u200a\u2019 the confluence of multiple factors do not vi-\nolate the law.\u201d).  And this approach would effectively \npreclude application of Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s third prong \nto adjudications, which by their nature involve discrete \n\n40 \n \nparties and virtually always implicate at least some \nparty-specific facts and judgments.  Cf. p. 25, supra.   \nMore fundamentally, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s approach \nwould largely drain the \u201cnationwide scope or effect\u201d \nprong of any practical significance.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  \nBy its terms, Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s third prong applies \nonly to actions that are \u201clocally or regionally applica-\nble.\u201d  Ibid.  Nearly all such actions can be expected to \nrest at least in part on consideration of local or regional \ncircumstances.  Yet on the Fifth Circuit\u2019s view, EPA\u2019s \nconsideration of such circumstances as one aspect of its \nanalysis suffices to preclude application of Section \n7607(b)(1)\u2019s third prong.   \nAs explained above (see pp. 37-38, supra), Congress \nenacted Section 7607(b)(1) in its current form after \nEPA\u2019s then-General Counsel highlighted the fact that \nEPA\u2019s approval and promulgation of implementation \nplans for individual States, which will necessarily rest \nat least in part on State-specific circumstances, can also \nraise issues of national significance for which D.C. Cir-\ncuit review is appropriate.  See 41 Fed. Reg. at 56,769.  \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision thus contravenes Con-\ngress\u2019s purpose of centralizing review of national issues \nin the D.C. Circuit and prioritizing the efficient resolu-\ntion of those issues, even when the actions also address \nlocal or regional concerns.  See Pet. App. 43a (Hig-\nginbotham, J., dissenting).   \nb. Respondents also contend that, because \u201cEPA in \nevery action [must] apply a uniform approach to simi-\nlarly affected parties,\u201d adopting the government\u2019s in-\nterpretation would allow D.C. Circuit venue for chal-\nlenges to every locally or regionally applicable EPA ac-\ntion.  Br. in Opp. 25-26.  That is incorrect.  The statutory \n\n41 \n \ntext includes significant limitations that would prevent \nthat result.   \ni. As an initial matter, the relevant language in Sec-\ntion 7607(b)(1) imposes a causation requirement, au-\nthorizing D.C. Circuit venue only when the challenged \nagency action is \u201cbased on a determination of nation-\nwide scope or effect.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1) (emphasis \nadded).  See pp. 30-31, supra.  EPA\u2019s finding that such \na standard is satisfied is subject to arbitrary-and- \ncapricious review.  See p. 32, supra.  That causation re-\nquirement ensures that D.C. Circuit review will be \navailable only if the relevant determinations are at the \ncore of EPA\u2019s action.  For the reasons already ex-\nplained, ibid., that causation requirement is satisfied \nhere\u2014but it will not be satisfied for every EPA action. \nii. The word \u201cdetermination\u201d suggests a resolution \nof an unsettled issue.  See Webster\u2019s 616 (\u201cthe settling \nand ending of a controversy esp. by judicial decision\u201d).  \nOn that understanding, EPA does not make a \u201cdetermi-\nnation of nationwide scope\u201d when it merely applies a \npreviously established agency rule, policy, or interpre-\ntation to new \u201clocally or regionally applicable\u201d circum-\nstances, even if EPA has previously expressed its intent \nthat the relevant agency rule or policy will apply nation-\nwide.  In deciding whether an EPA rule or policy con-\nstitutes a \u201cdetermination\u201d when the agency applies it in \ntaking a new action, the court may consider whether \nEPA announced the rule or policy at roughly the same \ntime as the challenged agency action itself.  The court \nmay also consider whether the participants in any  \nnotice-and-comment period or comparable agency pro-\nceeding leading up to the challenged action contested \nthe validity of the rule or policy. \n\n42 \n \nThat approach reflects a textually reasonable under-\nstanding of the statutory term \u201cdetermination,\u201d and it \nwould further the congressional policy judgments re-\nflected in the second and third prongs of Section \n7607(b)(1).  The vast majority of \u201clocally or regionally \napplicable\u201d EPA actions reflect the application of some \nnationwide agency rule, policy, or interpretation to a \nfactual setting that is confined to a single judicial cir-\ncuit.  When the circumstances suggest that the rule, pol-\nicy, or interpretation itself is likely to be called into \nquestion in any judicial challenge to the EPA action, \nrouting such challenges to the D.C. Circuit serves im-\nportant interests in judicial efficiency and nationwide \nuniformity.  That is particularly so if the relevant EPA \ndetermination is intended to govern future agency ac-\ntions.  But where the validity of the general rule or pol-\nicy appears to be settled, such that any judicial chal-\nlenges to the action are likely to focus on the application \nof the general pronouncement to discrete local facts, \nthose interests are inapposite. \nHere, EPA\u2019s new statutory interpretation and eco-\nnomic analysis were announced at roughly the same \ntime as, and were intended to guide, the denial actions \nthemselves.  Comments on the proposed denial actions \ndisputed the validity of the interpretation and analysis.  \nSee C.A. App. 96-144, 242-290 (summarizing and re-\nsponding to comments).  The interpretation and analy-\nsis therefore are properly viewed as EPA \u201cdetermina-\ntion[s]\u201d within the meaning of Section 7607(b)(1), rather \nthan as the application of settled nationwide principles \nto new factual settings.6 \n \n6  Respondents have contended (Br. in Opp. 29) that EPA\u2019s April \nand June 2022 denial actions raise distinct venue issues because the \n \n\n43 \n \niii. As explained above, a locally or regionally appli-\ncable EPA action is reviewable in the D.C. Circuit only \nif (a) the action \u201cis based on a determination of nation-\nwide scope or effect\u201d and (b) EPA \u201cfinds and publishes \nthat such action is based on such a determination.\u201d  42 \nU.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  Even when the facts and law would \nsupport the specified finding, EPA has plenary discre-\ntion to decide whether to publish that finding, and the \nagency \u201cmay weigh any number of considerations\u201d in \nmaking that decision.  Sierra Club, 47 F.4th at 746; see \np. 33, supra.  For example, EPA may consider whether \nany petitions for review of a particular action would \nlikely contest EPA determinations of national concern, \nor instead would likely dispute EPA\u2019s understanding of \nlocal or regional circumstances.  For EPA actions in the \nlatter category, the agency may decline to publish the \nrelevant finding, thereby ensuring that the regional cir-\ncuit will have venue over any challenge to the action.   \nc. The limitations described above meaningfully \nconstrain the number of locally or regionally applicable \nactions that will be subject to D.C. Circuit review, while \nfurthering the congressional purpose embodied in Sec-\ntion 7607(b)(1) to promote efficient and uniform resolu-\n \nApril denial action announced a new approach to small-refinery ex-\nemptions, while the June denial action simply applied that approach \nto additional refineries.  That contention is overstated.  Both denial \nactions here stemmed from a single proposed denial that first an-\nnounced EPA\u2019s new approach to exemptions.  Pet. App. 48a, 193a; \nsee 86 Fed. Reg. at 70,999 (proposing to \u201cdeny all pending [exemp-\ntion] petitions\u201d based on the agency\u2019s determinations regarding the \nmeaning of disproportionate economic hardship and the market re-\nalities of refinery operations).  The fact that a short time passed be-\ntween the finalization of the two actions\u2014without any court consid-\nering the validity of EPA\u2019s new determinations\u2014is an insufficient \nbasis to distinguish between the actions for purposes of venue.  \n\n44 \n \ntion of disputed issues of national significance.  By con-\ntrast, respondents\u2019 interpretation would limit D.C. Cir-\ncuit review of locally or regionally applicable EPA ac-\ntions to a vanishingly small category.  Embracing that \ninterpretation would lead to the very problems Con-\ngress sought to avoid in amending the CAA\u2019s venue pro-\nvision to include the nationwide-scope-or-effect lan-\nguage.   \nThis case is illustrative.  As a result of the Fifth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s refusal to transfer this case, EPA now faces two \nmerits decisions from two different circuit courts that \naddressed substantially similar challenges to the same \ndenial actions.  The petitioners in both circuits focused \ntheir attacks on the statutory interpretation and eco-\nnomic analysis that EPA had adopted and applied na-\ntionwide, not on any refinery-specific EPA findings.  \nAnd EPA avoided further fragmentation of judicial re-\nview only because five other regional courts of appeals \ndismissed similar challenges for improper venue or \ntransferred challenges to the D.C. Circuit.     \nAlthough both the Fifth and D.C. Circuits ultimately \nvacated EPA\u2019s denial actions, the differences in reason-\ning between the two circuits may lead to different re-\nsults on remand.7  That would create a bifurcated RFS \n \n7  Most notably, the Fifth Circuit found that refineries had reason-\nably relied on EPA\u2019s prior approach to adjudicating exemption pe-\ntitions, such that the agency\u2019s consideration of updated economic in-\nformation regarding RFS compliance costs\u2014relating to the \u201cRIN \ncost passthrough principle\u201d\u2014created an impermissible retroactive \neffect.  Pet. App. 14a; see id. at 16a-23a.  The D.C. Circuit declined \nto reach that issue.  See Sinclair Wyoming Ref. Co. v. EPA, 114 \nF.4th 693, 714 n.12 (2024) (per curiam).  Under the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \nretroactivity analysis, EPA would be required to evaluate the re-\nmanded petitions under its prior approach, without considering up-\n \n\n45 \n \nprogram consisting of one program for remanded peti-\ntions for most of the nation, and a separate, more favor-\nable program for exemption claimants in the Fifth Cir-\ncuit.  That result is contrary to Congress\u2019s direction to \nensure a uniform, nationwide framework for increasing \nrenewable fuel use, see e.g., 42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(2)(A)(i) \nand (o)(2)(B)(ii)(III), and with Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s evi-\ndent purpose of ensuring efficient, uniform resolution of \nissues with national significance.  And if this Court en-\ndorses the Fifth Circuit\u2019s venue analysis, future EPA \nactions similar to the denial actions here can be ex-\npected to spawn litigation in several courts of appeals, \nwith a consequent increased waste of judicial resources \nand a heightened risk of inconsistent outcomes.  Noth-\ning in the statutory text requires that result, and the \nCourt should reject it.   \n \n \n \ndated economic analysis of a small refinery\u2019s compliance costs be-\nyond those contemplated by the DOE study and corresponding \nscoring matrix.  That aspect of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s opinion focuses \nnot on any refinery-specific circumstance, but on the economic anal-\nysis EPA used in assessing exemption petitions from refineries na-\ntionwide.  Under the D.C. Circuit\u2019s analysis, by contrast, EPA may \nconsider any updated economic information about a small refinery\u2019s \ncompliance costs that is relevant to assessing whether the refinery \nactually suffers disproportionate economic hardship. \n\n46 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThis Court should vacate the order of the court of \nappeals and remand with instructions to transfer the \ncase to the D.C.

For any calendar year in which the Admin-\nistrator makes such a reduction, the Administra-\ntor may also reduce the applicable volume of re-\nnewable fuel and advanced biofuels requirement \nestablished under paragraph (2)(B) by the same or \na lesser volume. \n \n(ii) Whenever the Administrator reduces the \nminimum cellulosic biofuel volume under this sub-\nparagraph, the Administrator shall make availa-\nble for sale cellulosic biofuel credits at the higher \nof $0.25 per gallon or the amount by which $3.00 \nper gallon exceeds the average wholesale price of \na gallon of gasoline in the United States.  Such \namounts shall be adjusted for inflation by the Ad-\nministrator for years after 2008. \n \n(iii) Eighteen months after December 19, 2007, \nthe Administrator shall promulgate regulations to \ngovern the issuance of credits under this subpara-\ngraph.  The regulations shall set forth the \nmethod for determining the exact price of credits \nin the event of a waiver.  The price of such credits \nshall not be changed more frequently than once \neach quarter.  These regulations shall include \nsuch provisions, including limiting the credits\u2019 \nuses and useful life, as the Administrator deems \nappropriate to assist market liquidity and trans-\nparency, to provide appropriate certainty for reg-\nulated entities and renewable fuel producers, and \nto limit any potential misuse of cellulosic biofuel \ncredits to reduce the use of other renewable fuels, \nand for such other purposes as the Administrator \n\n24a \n \ndetermines will help achieve the goals of this sub-\nsection.  The regulations shall limit the number \nof cellulosic biofuel credits for any calendar year \nto the minimum applicable volume (as reduced un-\nder this subparagraph) of cellulosic biofuel for \nthat year. \n \n(E) \nBiomass-based diesel \n \n \n(i) \nMarket evaluation \n \nThe Administrator, in consultation with the \nSecretary of Energy and the Secretary of Ag-\nriculture, shall periodically evaluate the impact \nof the biomass-based diesel requirements es-\ntablished under this paragraph on the price of \ndiesel fuel. \n \n \n(ii) \nWaiver \n \nIf the Administrator determines that there \nis a significant renewable feedstock disruption \nor other market circumstances that would \nmake the price of biomass-based diesel fuel in-\ncrease significantly, the Administrator, in con-\nsultation with the Secretary of Energy and the \nSecretary of Agriculture, shall issue an order \nto reduce, for up to a 60-day period, the quan-\ntity of biomass-based diesel required under \nsubparagraph (A) by an appropriate quantity \nthat does not exceed 15 percent of the applica-\nble annual requirement for biomass-based die-\nsel.  For any calendar year in which the Ad-\nministrator makes a reduction under this sub-\nparagraph, the Administrator may also reduce \nthe applicable volume of renewable fuel and ad-\nvanced biofuels requirement established under \n\n25a \n \nparagraph (2)(B) by the same or a lesser vol-\nume. \n \n \n(iii) Extensions \n \nIf the Administrator determines that the \nfeedstock disruption or circumstances de-\nscribed in clause (ii) is continuing beyond the \n60-day period described in clause (ii) or this \nclause, the Administrator, in consultation with \nthe Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of \nAgriculture, may issue an order to reduce, for \nup to an additional 60-day period, the quantity \nof biomass-based diesel required under sub-\nparagraph (A) by an appropriate quantity that \ndoes not exceed an additional 15 percent of the \napplicable annual requirement for biomass-\nbased diesel. \n \n(F) \nModification of applicable volumes \n \nFor any of the tables in paragraph (2)(B), if the \nAdministrator waives\u2014 \n \n(i) \nat least 20 percent of the applicable vol-\nume requirement set forth in any such table for \n2 consecutive years; or \n \n(ii) at least 50 percent of such volume re-\nquirement for a single year, \nthe Administrator shall promulgate a rule (within \n1 year after issuing such waiver) that modifies the \napplicable volumes set forth in the table con-\ncerned for all years following the final year to \nwhich the waiver applies, except that no such mod-\nification in applicable volumes shall be made for \nany year before 2016.  In promulgating such a \n\n26a \n \nrule, the Administrator shall comply with the pro-\ncesses, criteria, and standards set forth in para-\ngraph (2)(B)(ii). \n(8) Study and waiver for initial year of program \n \n(A) \nIn general \n \nNot later than 180 days after August 8, 2005, \nthe Secretary of Energy shall conduct for the Ad-\nministrator a study assessing whether the renew-\nable fuel requirement under paragraph (2) will \nlikely result in significant adverse impacts on con-\nsumers in 2006, on a national, regional, or State \nbasis. \n \n(B) \nRequired evaluations \n \n \nThe study shall evaluate renewable fuel\u2014 \n \n \n \n(i) \nsupplies and prices; \n \n \n \n(ii) blendstock supplies; and \n \n(iii) supply and distribution system capabil-\nities. \n \n(C) \nRecommendations by the Secretary \n \nBased on the results of the study, the Secretary \nof Energy shall make specific recommendations to \nthe Administrator concerning waiver of the re-\nquirements of paragraph (2), in whole or in part, \nto prevent any adverse impacts described in sub-\nparagraph (A). \n \n(D) \nWaiver \n \n \n(i) \nIn general \n \nNot later than 270 days after August 8, 2005, \nthe Administrator shall, if and to the extent \n\n27a \n \nrecommended by the Secretary of Energy un-\nder subparagraph (C), waive, in whole or in \npart, the renewable fuel requirement under \nparagraph (2) by reducing the national quan-\ntity of renewable fuel required under para-\ngraph (2) in calendar year 2006. \n \n \n(ii) \nNo effect on waiver authority \n \nClause (i) does not limit the authority of the \nAdministrator to waive the requirements of \nparagraph (2) in whole, or in part, under para-\ngraph (7). \n(9) Small refineries \n \n(A) \nTemporary exemption \n \n \n(i) \nIn general \n \nThe requirements of paragraph (2) shall not \napply to small refineries until calendar year \n2011. \n \n \n(ii) \nExtension of exemption \n \n \n \n(I) \nStudy by Secretary of Energy \n \nNot later than December 31, 2008, the \nSecretary of Energy shall conduct for the \nAdministrator a study to determine whether \ncompliance with the requirements of para-\ngraph (2) would impose a disproportionate \neconomic hardship on small refineries. \n \n \n \n(II) \nExtension of exemption \n \nIn the case of a small refinery that the \nSecretary of Energy determines under sub-\nclause (I) would be subject to a dispropor-\n\n28a \n \ntionate economic hardship if required to \ncomply with paragraph (2), the Administra-\ntor shall extend the exemption under clause \n(i) for the small refinery for a period of not \nless than 2 additional years. \n \n(B) \nPetitions based on disproportionate eco-\nnomic hardship \n \n \n(i) \nExtension of exemption \n \nA small refinery may at any time petition \nthe Administrator for an extension of the ex-\nemption under subparagraph (A) for the reason \nof disproportionate economic hardship. \n \n \n(ii) \nEvaluation of petitions \n \nIn evaluating a petition under clause (i), the \nAdministrator, in consultation with the Secre-\ntary of Energy, shall consider the findings of \nthe study under subparagraph (A)(ii) and other \neconomic factors. \n \n \n(iii) Deadline for action on petitions \n \nThe Administrator shall act on any petition \nsubmitted by a small refinery for a hardship ex-\nemption not later than 90 days after the date of \nreceipt of the petition. \n \n(C) \nCredit program \n \nIf a small refinery notifies the Administrator \nthat the small refinery waives the exemption un-\nder subparagraph (A), the regulations promul-\ngated under paragraph (2)(A) shall provide for the \ngeneration of credits by the small refinery under \n\n29a \n \nparagraph (5) beginning in the calendar year fol-\nlowing the date of notification. \n \n(D) \nOpt-in for small refineries \n \nA small refinery shall be subject to the require-\nments of paragraph (2) if the small refinery noti-\nfies the Administrator that the small refinery \nwaives the exemption under subparagraph (A). \n(10) Ethanol market concentration analysis \n \n(A) \nAnalysis \n \n \n(i) \nIn general \n \nNot later than 180 days after August 8, 2005, \nand annually thereafter, the Federal Trade \nCommission shall perform a market concentra-\ntion analysis of the ethanol production industry \nusing the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index to de-\ntermine whether there is sufficient competition \namong industry participants to avoid price- \nsetting and other anticompetitive behavior. \n \n \n(ii) \nScoring \n \nFor the purpose of scoring under clause (i) \nusing the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, all \nmarketing arrangements among industry par-\nticipants shall be considered. \n \n(B) \nReport \n \nNot later than December 1, 2005, and annually \nthereafter, the Federal Trade Commission shall \nsubmit to Congress and the Administrator a re-\nport on the results of the market concentration \nanalysis performed under subparagraph (A)(i). \n\n30a \n \n(11) Periodic reviews \n \nTo allow for the appropriate adjustment of the re-\nquirements described in subparagraph (B) of para-\ngraph (2), the Administrator shall conduct periodic \nreviews of\u2014 \n \n \n(A) \nexisting technologies;

Circuit. Analyzing their interpretation of the Clean Air Act's venue provision, the precedents they cite, and their characterization of the EPA's action is fundamental to the task. Therefore, the Task EIG is very high, as this information will directly and substantially inform the prediction.

Main Street, Suite 201\nMadison, WI 53703 \n \n\n \nQUESTION PRESENTED \nThe Clean Air Act requires the Environmental Protec-\ntion Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) to grant an exemption from the Act\u2019s \nRenewable Fuel Standard (\u201cRFS\u201d) to a small refinery \nwhen compliance with the RFS would cause the refinery \ndisproportionate economic hardship in a given year.  \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(i). The six small refinery re-\nspondents here separately petitioned EPA for hardship \nexemptions for particular compliance years. EPA con-\ncluded, after \u201cconsider[ing] each [respondent\u2019s] individual \nrefinery information,\u201d that each of the respondents was \nnot entitled to hardship relief and denied the petitions. \nPet.App.14a-15a. Respondents then petitioned for judicial \nreview as permitted by the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1). The question presented is:  \nWhether an EPA decision denying a small refinery\u2019s \nRFS hardship petition is a \u201clocally or regionally applica-\nble\u201d action, such that a court challenge to that action is \nproperly venued in a regional circuit court, or is instead a \n\u201cnationally applicable\u201d action or an action \u201cbased on a  \ndetermination of nationwide scope or effect\u201d that must be \nchallenged only in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. \nCircuit. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). \n \n \n\n \nii \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nStatutory Provision Involved ............................................. 1 \nIntroduction ......................................................................... 3 \nStatement ............................................................................. 6 \nA.

A petition for review of the Administrator\u2019s  \naction in approving or promulgating any implementation \nplan under section 7410 of this title or section 7411(d) of \nthis title, any order under section 7411(j) of this title,  \nunder section 7412 of this title, under section 7419 of this \ntitle, or under section 7420 of this title, or his action under \nsection 1857c-10(c)(2)(A), (B), or (C) of this title (as in  \neffect before August 7, 1977) or under regulations there-\nunder, or revising regulations for enhanced monitoring \nand compliance certification programs under section \n7414(a)(3) of this title, or any other final action of the  \nAdministrator under this chapter (including any denial or \ndisapproval by the Administrator under subchapter I) \nwhich is locally or regionally applicable may be filed only \nin the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate \ncircuit. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence a petition \nfor review of any action referred to in such sentence may \nbe filed only in the United States Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia if such action is based on a determi-\nnation of nationwide scope or effect and if in taking such \naction the Administrator finds and publishes that such  \naction is based on such a determination. \n* \nThis and other pertinent statutory provisions are  \nreprinted in the appendix to this brief. App.1a-31a, infra. \n \n \n\n \n3 \nINTRODUCTION \nThe Clean Air Act (\u201cCAA\u201d or \u201cAct\u201d) assigns the venue \nfor a petition for judicial review of final agency action by \nasking whether the challenged action is \u201cnationally appli-\ncable\u201d (reviewed by the D.C. Circuit) or \u201clocally or region-\nally applicable\u201d (reviewed by the regional circuit courts). \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1).1 Determining venue thus requires \nfocusing with precision on the \u201caction\u201d that the Environ-\nmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) was authorized by the \nCAA to take: the \u201cfinal action taken \u2026 under this chap-\nter.\u201d Ibid. (\u201c[T]his chapter\u201d is the CAA.) \nOnce the final action is properly identified, the venue \nprovision is straightforward. Most EPA actions under the \nAct are rulemakings or similar actions that apply through-\nout the entire nation, or else are adjudications or similar \ndecisions involving individual States or regulated entities. \nThe former go to the D.C. Circuit, the latter to the re-\ngional circuit courts\u2014save only in the exceptional circum-\nstance where the CAA\u2019s text directs EPA to base a local \naction on a \u201cdetermination\u201d about the whole nation. \nApplying those statutory instructions here shows why \nthe Fifth Circuit below got the venue question right. This \ncase concerns a type of statutory forbearance from the \nCAA\u2019s Renewable Fuel Standard (\u201cRFS\u201d) that affects \nonly small refineries. Small refineries like respondents \nmay petition EPA for an exemption from the RFS obliga-\ntion by showing that they will face disproportionate eco-\nnomic hardship from compliance with the RFS in a given \nyear. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(A)-(B). Until a presidential administra-\ntion change in 2021, EPA had repeatedly acknowledged \nthat its decisions on small refineries\u2019 hardship petitions \n \n1  All statutory citations are to Title 42 of the United States \nCode. \n\n \n4 \nare quintessential locally applicable actions that Section \n7607(b)(1) refers to the regional circuits. That\u2019s because \neach EPA \u201cfinal action\u201d on a hardship-exemption petition \nadjudicates the rights of only one small refinery located in \none place, and the \u201cchapter\u201d (the CAA) requires those ac-\ntions to be based on consideration of each small refinery\u2019s \nown economic hardship. \u00a7 7607(b)(1); see \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B). \nEPA changed its position on venue and started delib-\nerately attempting to re-direct judicial challenges to its \npreferred court, the D.C. Circuit, only after it suffered a \nstring of defeats in regional circuit courts that found EPA \nhad wrongly decided hardship petitions. EPA now argues \nthat, because it published its decisions on multiple small \nrefineries\u2019 pending hardship petitions bundled together in \ntwo explanation documents (denying every pending peti-\ntion), it was able to convert what it has long agreed were \nlocally applicable final actions into just two nationally  \napplicable actions. EPA was transparent about its goal of \nmaking the D.C. Circuit the only court allowed to review \nits latest denial decisions. \nEPA\u2019s new venue position is contrary to the CAA\u2019s \ntext, and the Fifth Circuit correctly rejected it. EPA was \nable to produce the bundled decisions only by ignoring the \nstatutory command to decide hardship petitions individu-\nally as they come in. More fundamentally, the two expla-\nnation documents were bundles of individual final actions \nunder the CAA. EPA\u2019s choice about how to publish its  \ndecisions cannot change the nature of the \u201cfinal action \ntaken \u2026 under this chapter,\u201d which is what matters for \nvenue. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). It is the statutory text\u2014\u201cth[e] chap-\nter\u201d\u2014that establishes what actions EPA is permitted to \ntake. And here, every relevant provision of the chapter \nconfirms that EPA was required to produce individualized \n\n \n5 \nfinal actions based on individual petitioning refineries\u2019 \neconomic circumstances.  \nIn fact, that is just what EPA did. EPA itself has \nstated that it denied all of the small-refinery respondents\u2019 \nRFS hardship petitions because it \u201cdetermin[ed],\u201d after \n\u201cconsider[ing] each [refinery\u2019s] individual refinery infor-\nmation,\u201d that each respondent was not experiencing dis-\nproportionate economic hardship. Pet.App.14a-15a. EPA \nconcluded, after examining each respondent\u2019s evidence, \nthat each ostensibly passes on 100% of its RFS compliance \ncosts in the price of the fuel it sells. Those were the con-\nclusions on which EPA based its decisions to deny hard-\nship relief to these small-refinery respondents, each of \nwhich received an individualized explanation from EPA \nanalyzing its own economic evidence. \nMultiple courts of appeals (including the D.C. Circuit) \nhave since held that EPA\u2019s merits reasoning about the \nsmall refineries\u2019 ability to pass through their RFS compli-\nance costs was arbitrary and capricious and unsupported \nby the record evidence. But the venue issue before this \nCourt is simpler. To borrow Judge Silberman\u2019s descrip-\ntion of the venue provision that EPA endorses (U.S. Br. \n18): EPA\u2019s answer to whether a petitioning small refinery \nlike Calumet Shreveport located in Shreveport, Louisi-\nana, does or does not successfully pass through its RFS \ncompliance costs in its fuel sales hardly qualifies as a \u201creg-\nulatory issue[ ] of national importance\u201d that belongs in the \nD.C. Circuit. National Env\u2019t Dev. Ass\u2019ns Clean Air Pro-\nject v. EPA, 891 F.3d. 1041, 1054 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (Silber-\nman, J., concurring). \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment should be affirmed. \n\n \n6 \nSTATEMENT \nA. Statutory and regulatory background \n1. Venue for petitions for review under the Clean \nAir Act \nSection 7607(b)(1) governs \u201c[j]udicial review\u201d of \u201cpeti-\ntions for review\u201d of EPA\u2019s \u201cfinal action[s] under this chap-\nter,\u201d i.e., under the Clean Air Act. See Kentucky v. EPA, \n123 F.4th 447, 458, 461 (6th Cir. 2024); 42 U.S.C. Ch. 85, \nCodification Note (\u201cthis chapter\u201d is the CAA). As relevant \nhere, Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s venue instructions consist of \nthree \u201clengthy\u201d sentences. Kentucky, 123 F.4th at 458.  \na. The first sentence describes the proper venue for \nchallenging EPA final actions that apply to the nation as \na whole. That sentence begins by enumerating several \nCAA provisions authorizing EPA to take national actions. \nFor example, when EPA promulgates a national primary \nor secondary air quality standard under Section 7412, or \nsets a standard of performance for all new stationary \nsources of emissions under Section 7411, challenges to \nthose national actions \u201cmay be filed only in\u201d the D.C. Cir-\ncuit. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). In 1977, Congress amended the venue \nprovision to add a catchall phrase to that sentence: In  \naddition to the enumerated national actions, \u201cany other \nnationally applicable regulations promulgated, or final  \naction taken, by the Administrator under this chapter\u201d \nare reviewable only in the D.C. Circuit. Ibid.; see Clean \nAir Act Amendments of 1977, Pub. L. No. 95-95, 91 Stat. \n685 (Aug. 7, 1977).2 \n \n \n2  For ease of reference, the 1970 and 1982 versions of the \nvenue provision (the latter including the 1977 amendments) are \nprovided at App., infra, 29a and 30a, respectively. \n\n \n7 \nb. The second sentence follows the same basic struc-\nture but for non-national final agency actions. It first enu-\nmerates CAA provisions authorizing EPA to take actions \nthat apply to less than the whole country, and it makes \nthose actions reviewable only in regional circuit courts. \nFor example, when EPA approves or promulgates a state \nimplementation plan under Sections 7410 or 7411(d), a \nchallenge to that action \u201cmay be filed only in the United \nStates Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit.\u201d \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1). The second sentence of Section 7607(b)(1), \nlike the first, also includes a catchall phrase added by the \nsame 1977 amendment: \u201cany other final action of the  \nAdministrator under this chapter \u2026 which is locally or  \nregionally applicable\u201d is reviewable only in \u201cthe appropri-\nate circuit\u201d court. Ibid.  \nIdentifying which circuit court is \u201cappropriate\u201d for  \nreviewing local or regional final action is usually easy. \nThat\u2019s because for these EPA actions, the relevant sub-\nstantive CAA provision makes it clear that the action  \naffects particular regulated facilities or States, each of \nwhich is governed by a regional circuit court. When EPA \npromulgates a regional action that happens to touch more \nthan one federal circuit\u2014for example, approving or re-\njecting an implementation plan for the Metropolitan Kan-\nsas City air-quality-control region\u2014there may be more \nthan one appropriate circuit. \nc. The courts of appeals and EPA agree that, to  \nassess the national vs. local applicability of an EPA action \nfor purposes of Section 7607(b)(1), courts look only \u201cto the \nface\u201d of the action as that action is authorized by the \nCAA\u2014not to the challenger\u2019s arguments in the petition \nfor review, and not to the effects of the action or the rea-\nsoning within it. American Rd. & Transp. Builders Ass\u2019n \nv. EPA, 705 F.3d 453, 456 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (Kavanaugh, \n\n \n8 \nJ.); see also, e.g., ATK Launch Sys., Inc. v. EPA, 651 F.3d \n1194, 1197 (10th Cir. 2011); U.S. Br. 20 (invoking \u201cthe face \nof \u201d the actions). That focus on what action EPA took fol-\nlows from the statutory instruction to look to the \u201cfinal ac-\ntion \u2026 under this chapter\u201d to resolve venue. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). \nThe textual structure of Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s first two \nsentences\u2014enumerated lists of CAA actions followed by \ncatchall phrases\u2014indicates that courts should apply the \ncatchall phrases by reasoning by analogy to the enumer-\nated provisions. The catchall phrases use a \u201ccollective \nterm\u201d\u2014any other final action\u2014\u201cat the end of a list of spe-\ncific items,\u201d so the collective term is \u201ccontrolled and  \ndefined by reference to the specific classes that precede \nit.\u201d Fischer v. United States, 603 U.S. 480, 487 (2024) \n(ejusdem generis canon) (cleaned up); see Kentucky, 123 \nF.4th at 460 (using ejusdem generis to interpret Section \n7607(b)(1)). Thus, an EPA final action pursuant to an  \nunenumerated CAA provision is \u201cnationally applicable\u201d if \nit applies to the whole nation like the enumerated actions \nin the first sentence of Section 7607(b)(1) do. And a final  \naction is \u201clocally or regionally applicable\u201d if it applies to \nless than the whole nation, as the enumerated CAA  \nactions in the second sentence do. Ibid. \nd. The third sentence contemplates a narrow excep-\ntion for certain rare EPA actions that, though locally or \nregionally applicable, are \u201cbased on a determination of  \nnationwide scope or effect.\u201d \u00a7 7607(b)(1). That sentence \nwas added by the same 1977 amendment referenced \nabove, prompted by a recommendation from the Adminis-\ntrative Conference of the United States that included a \nstatement from EPA General Counsel William Frick. See \n41 Fed. Reg. 56,767 (Dec. 30, 1976).  \nFrick had identified a circumstance where the third-\nsentence exception was needed. 41 Fed. Reg. at 56,768-\n\n \n9 \n56,769.

Main Street, Suite 201\nMadison, WI 53703 \n \n\n \nQUESTION PRESENTED \nThe Clean Air Act requires the Environmental Protec-\ntion Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) to grant an exemption from the Act\u2019s \nRenewable Fuel Standard (\u201cRFS\u201d) to a small refinery \nwhen compliance with the RFS would cause the refinery \ndisproportionate economic hardship in a given year.  \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(i). The six small refinery re-\nspondents here separately petitioned EPA for hardship \nexemptions for particular compliance years. EPA con-\ncluded, after \u201cconsider[ing] each [respondent\u2019s] individual \nrefinery information,\u201d that each of the respondents was \nnot entitled to hardship relief and denied the petitions. \nPet.App.14a-15a. Respondents then petitioned for judicial \nreview as permitted by the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1). The question presented is:  \nWhether an EPA decision denying a small refinery\u2019s \nRFS hardship petition is a \u201clocally or regionally applica-\nble\u201d action, such that a court challenge to that action is \nproperly venued in a regional circuit court, or is instead a \n\u201cnationally applicable\u201d action or an action \u201cbased on a  \ndetermination of nationwide scope or effect\u201d that must be \nchallenged only in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. \nCircuit. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). \n \n \n\n \nii \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nStatutory Provision Involved ............................................. 1 \nIntroduction ......................................................................... 3 \nStatement ............................................................................. 6 \nA.

A petition for review of the Administrator\u2019s  \naction in approving or promulgating any implementation \nplan under section 7410 of this title or section 7411(d) of \nthis title, any order under section 7411(j) of this title,  \nunder section 7412 of this title, under section 7419 of this \ntitle, or under section 7420 of this title, or his action under \nsection 1857c-10(c)(2)(A), (B), or (C) of this title (as in  \neffect before August 7, 1977) or under regulations there-\nunder, or revising regulations for enhanced monitoring \nand compliance certification programs under section \n7414(a)(3) of this title, or any other final action of the  \nAdministrator under this chapter (including any denial or \ndisapproval by the Administrator under subchapter I) \nwhich is locally or regionally applicable may be filed only \nin the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate \ncircuit. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence a petition \nfor review of any action referred to in such sentence may \nbe filed only in the United States Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia if such action is based on a determi-\nnation of nationwide scope or effect and if in taking such \naction the Administrator finds and publishes that such  \naction is based on such a determination. \n* \nThis and other pertinent statutory provisions are  \nreprinted in the appendix to this brief. App.1a-31a, infra. \n \n \n\n \n3 \nINTRODUCTION \nThe Clean Air Act (\u201cCAA\u201d or \u201cAct\u201d) assigns the venue \nfor a petition for judicial review of final agency action by \nasking whether the challenged action is \u201cnationally appli-\ncable\u201d (reviewed by the D.C. Circuit) or \u201clocally or region-\nally applicable\u201d (reviewed by the regional circuit courts). \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1).1 Determining venue thus requires \nfocusing with precision on the \u201caction\u201d that the Environ-\nmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) was authorized by the \nCAA to take: the \u201cfinal action taken \u2026 under this chap-\nter.\u201d Ibid. (\u201c[T]his chapter\u201d is the CAA.) \nOnce the final action is properly identified, the venue \nprovision is straightforward. Most EPA actions under the \nAct are rulemakings or similar actions that apply through-\nout the entire nation, or else are adjudications or similar \ndecisions involving individual States or regulated entities. \nThe former go to the D.C. Circuit, the latter to the re-\ngional circuit courts\u2014save only in the exceptional circum-\nstance where the CAA\u2019s text directs EPA to base a local \naction on a \u201cdetermination\u201d about the whole nation. \nApplying those statutory instructions here shows why \nthe Fifth Circuit below got the venue question right. This \ncase concerns a type of statutory forbearance from the \nCAA\u2019s Renewable Fuel Standard (\u201cRFS\u201d) that affects \nonly small refineries. Small refineries like respondents \nmay petition EPA for an exemption from the RFS obliga-\ntion by showing that they will face disproportionate eco-\nnomic hardship from compliance with the RFS in a given \nyear. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(A)-(B). Until a presidential administra-\ntion change in 2021, EPA had repeatedly acknowledged \nthat its decisions on small refineries\u2019 hardship petitions \n \n1  All statutory citations are to Title 42 of the United States \nCode. \n\n \n4 \nare quintessential locally applicable actions that Section \n7607(b)(1) refers to the regional circuits. That\u2019s because \neach EPA \u201cfinal action\u201d on a hardship-exemption petition \nadjudicates the rights of only one small refinery located in \none place, and the \u201cchapter\u201d (the CAA) requires those ac-\ntions to be based on consideration of each small refinery\u2019s \nown economic hardship. \u00a7 7607(b)(1); see \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B). \nEPA changed its position on venue and started delib-\nerately attempting to re-direct judicial challenges to its \npreferred court, the D.C. Circuit, only after it suffered a \nstring of defeats in regional circuit courts that found EPA \nhad wrongly decided hardship petitions. EPA now argues \nthat, because it published its decisions on multiple small \nrefineries\u2019 pending hardship petitions bundled together in \ntwo explanation documents (denying every pending peti-\ntion), it was able to convert what it has long agreed were \nlocally applicable final actions into just two nationally  \napplicable actions. EPA was transparent about its goal of \nmaking the D.C. Circuit the only court allowed to review \nits latest denial decisions. \nEPA\u2019s new venue position is contrary to the CAA\u2019s \ntext, and the Fifth Circuit correctly rejected it. EPA was \nable to produce the bundled decisions only by ignoring the \nstatutory command to decide hardship petitions individu-\nally as they come in. More fundamentally, the two expla-\nnation documents were bundles of individual final actions \nunder the CAA. EPA\u2019s choice about how to publish its  \ndecisions cannot change the nature of the \u201cfinal action \ntaken \u2026 under this chapter,\u201d which is what matters for \nvenue. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). It is the statutory text\u2014\u201cth[e] chap-\nter\u201d\u2014that establishes what actions EPA is permitted to \ntake. And here, every relevant provision of the chapter \nconfirms that EPA was required to produce individualized \n\n \n5 \nfinal actions based on individual petitioning refineries\u2019 \neconomic circumstances.  \nIn fact, that is just what EPA did. EPA itself has \nstated that it denied all of the small-refinery respondents\u2019 \nRFS hardship petitions because it \u201cdetermin[ed],\u201d after \n\u201cconsider[ing] each [refinery\u2019s] individual refinery infor-\nmation,\u201d that each respondent was not experiencing dis-\nproportionate economic hardship. Pet.App.14a-15a. EPA \nconcluded, after examining each respondent\u2019s evidence, \nthat each ostensibly passes on 100% of its RFS compliance \ncosts in the price of the fuel it sells. Those were the con-\nclusions on which EPA based its decisions to deny hard-\nship relief to these small-refinery respondents, each of \nwhich received an individualized explanation from EPA \nanalyzing its own economic evidence. \nMultiple courts of appeals (including the D.C. Circuit) \nhave since held that EPA\u2019s merits reasoning about the \nsmall refineries\u2019 ability to pass through their RFS compli-\nance costs was arbitrary and capricious and unsupported \nby the record evidence. But the venue issue before this \nCourt is simpler. To borrow Judge Silberman\u2019s descrip-\ntion of the venue provision that EPA endorses (U.S. Br. \n18): EPA\u2019s answer to whether a petitioning small refinery \nlike Calumet Shreveport located in Shreveport, Louisi-\nana, does or does not successfully pass through its RFS \ncompliance costs in its fuel sales hardly qualifies as a \u201creg-\nulatory issue[ ] of national importance\u201d that belongs in the \nD.C. Circuit. National Env\u2019t Dev. Ass\u2019ns Clean Air Pro-\nject v. EPA, 891 F.3d. 1041, 1054 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (Silber-\nman, J., concurring). \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment should be affirmed. \n\n \n6 \nSTATEMENT \nA. Statutory and regulatory background \n1. Venue for petitions for review under the Clean \nAir Act \nSection 7607(b)(1) governs \u201c[j]udicial review\u201d of \u201cpeti-\ntions for review\u201d of EPA\u2019s \u201cfinal action[s] under this chap-\nter,\u201d i.e., under the Clean Air Act. See Kentucky v. EPA, \n123 F.4th 447, 458, 461 (6th Cir. 2024); 42 U.S.C. Ch. 85, \nCodification Note (\u201cthis chapter\u201d is the CAA). As relevant \nhere, Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s venue instructions consist of \nthree \u201clengthy\u201d sentences. Kentucky, 123 F.4th at 458.  \na. The first sentence describes the proper venue for \nchallenging EPA final actions that apply to the nation as \na whole. That sentence begins by enumerating several \nCAA provisions authorizing EPA to take national actions. \nFor example, when EPA promulgates a national primary \nor secondary air quality standard under Section 7412, or \nsets a standard of performance for all new stationary \nsources of emissions under Section 7411, challenges to \nthose national actions \u201cmay be filed only in\u201d the D.C. Cir-\ncuit. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). In 1977, Congress amended the venue \nprovision to add a catchall phrase to that sentence: In  \naddition to the enumerated national actions, \u201cany other \nnationally applicable regulations promulgated, or final  \naction taken, by the Administrator under this chapter\u201d \nare reviewable only in the D.C. Circuit. Ibid.; see Clean \nAir Act Amendments of 1977, Pub. L. No. 95-95, 91 Stat. \n685 (Aug. 7, 1977).2 \n \n \n2  For ease of reference, the 1970 and 1982 versions of the \nvenue provision (the latter including the 1977 amendments) are \nprovided at App., infra, 29a and 30a, respectively. \n\n \n7 \nb. The second sentence follows the same basic struc-\nture but for non-national final agency actions. It first enu-\nmerates CAA provisions authorizing EPA to take actions \nthat apply to less than the whole country, and it makes \nthose actions reviewable only in regional circuit courts. \nFor example, when EPA approves or promulgates a state \nimplementation plan under Sections 7410 or 7411(d), a \nchallenge to that action \u201cmay be filed only in the United \nStates Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit.\u201d \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1). The second sentence of Section 7607(b)(1), \nlike the first, also includes a catchall phrase added by the \nsame 1977 amendment: \u201cany other final action of the  \nAdministrator under this chapter \u2026 which is locally or  \nregionally applicable\u201d is reviewable only in \u201cthe appropri-\nate circuit\u201d court. Ibid.  \nIdentifying which circuit court is \u201cappropriate\u201d for  \nreviewing local or regional final action is usually easy. \nThat\u2019s because for these EPA actions, the relevant sub-\nstantive CAA provision makes it clear that the action  \naffects particular regulated facilities or States, each of \nwhich is governed by a regional circuit court. When EPA \npromulgates a regional action that happens to touch more \nthan one federal circuit\u2014for example, approving or re-\njecting an implementation plan for the Metropolitan Kan-\nsas City air-quality-control region\u2014there may be more \nthan one appropriate circuit. \nc. The courts of appeals and EPA agree that, to  \nassess the national vs. local applicability of an EPA action \nfor purposes of Section 7607(b)(1), courts look only \u201cto the \nface\u201d of the action as that action is authorized by the \nCAA\u2014not to the challenger\u2019s arguments in the petition \nfor review, and not to the effects of the action or the rea-\nsoning within it. American Rd. & Transp. Builders Ass\u2019n \nv. EPA, 705 F.3d 453, 456 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (Kavanaugh, \n\n \n8 \nJ.); see also, e.g., ATK Launch Sys., Inc. v. EPA, 651 F.3d \n1194, 1197 (10th Cir. 2011); U.S. Br. 20 (invoking \u201cthe face \nof \u201d the actions). That focus on what action EPA took fol-\nlows from the statutory instruction to look to the \u201cfinal ac-\ntion \u2026 under this chapter\u201d to resolve venue. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). \nThe textual structure of Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s first two \nsentences\u2014enumerated lists of CAA actions followed by \ncatchall phrases\u2014indicates that courts should apply the \ncatchall phrases by reasoning by analogy to the enumer-\nated provisions. The catchall phrases use a \u201ccollective \nterm\u201d\u2014any other final action\u2014\u201cat the end of a list of spe-\ncific items,\u201d so the collective term is \u201ccontrolled and  \ndefined by reference to the specific classes that precede \nit.\u201d Fischer v. United States, 603 U.S. 480, 487 (2024) \n(ejusdem generis canon) (cleaned up); see Kentucky, 123 \nF.4th at 460 (using ejusdem generis to interpret Section \n7607(b)(1)). Thus, an EPA final action pursuant to an  \nunenumerated CAA provision is \u201cnationally applicable\u201d if \nit applies to the whole nation like the enumerated actions \nin the first sentence of Section 7607(b)(1) do. And a final  \naction is \u201clocally or regionally applicable\u201d if it applies to \nless than the whole nation, as the enumerated CAA  \nactions in the second sentence do. Ibid. \nd. The third sentence contemplates a narrow excep-\ntion for certain rare EPA actions that, though locally or \nregionally applicable, are \u201cbased on a determination of  \nnationwide scope or effect.\u201d \u00a7 7607(b)(1). That sentence \nwas added by the same 1977 amendment referenced \nabove, prompted by a recommendation from the Adminis-\ntrative Conference of the United States that included a \nstatement from EPA General Counsel William Frick. See \n41 Fed. Reg. 56,767 (Dec. 30, 1976).  \nFrick had identified a circumstance where the third-\nsentence exception was needed. 41 Fed. Reg. at 56,768-\n\n \n9 \n56,769. Under a particular CAA provision at the time \n(since repealed), EPA could grant extensions of a State\u2019s \nattainment date for certain national ambient air quality \nstandards\u2014actions that were locally applicable\u2014only \u201cif \nafter review ... the Administrator determine[d] that,\u201d \namong other things, regulated emission sources were  \n\u201cunable to comply with the [applicable] requirements \u2026 \nbecause the necessary technology or other alternatives \nare not available or will not be available soon enough to \npermit compliance.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857c-5(e) (1973) (empha-\nsis added); see NRDC v. EPA, 475 F.2d 968 (D.C. Cir. \n1973) (explaining the available-technology determination \nand corresponding extension action). \nFrick\u2019s statement, which the government agrees (U.S. \nBr. 37) was the genesis of the third sentence in Sec-\ntion 7607(b)(1), illustrates how that exception works: If \nthe statutory text requires a particular EPA action to be \nbased on a statutory \u201cdetermination\u201d about a circum-\nstance equally affecting the whole nation, then a chal-\nlenge to that action should go to the D.C. Circuit. \nCongress provided that \u201cif \u201d a locally applicable action \u201cis \nbased on a determination of nationwide scope or effect and \nif in taking such action [EPA] finds and publishes that \nsuch action is based on such a determination,\u201d then the \nproper venue is the D.C. Circuit. \u00a7 7607(b)(1).  \nThe third sentence thus establishes two independent \nrequirements for this exception: the action must actually \nbe based on a determination of nationwide scope or effect, \nand EPA must publish a finding that it is so based. Accord \nU.S. Br. 30. Whether EPA publishes that finding is the \nonly part of Section 7607(b)(1) that contemplates any dis-\ncretion for the agency. The text is thus \u201cclear\u201d that \u201c[t]he \ncourt\u2014not EPA\u2014determines both the scope of an  \naction\u2019s applicability and whether it was based on a deter-\n\n \n10 \nmination of nationwide scope or effect.\u201d Texas v. EPA \n(\u201cTexas 2020\u201d), 983 F.3d 826, 833 (5th Cir. 2020); accord  \nSierra Club v. EPA, 47 F.4th 738, 746 (D.C. Cir. 2022). \ne. In sum, the CAA allocates venue for regulatory \nchallenges depending on the nature of the \u201cfinal action\u201d \nunder review: If EPA\u2019s \u201cfinal action \u2026 under this chap-\nter\u201d is \u201cnationally applicable,\u201d then the proper venue is \nthe D.C. Circuit. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). If EPA\u2019s \u201cfinal action \u2026  \nunder this chapter\u201d is \u201clocally or regionally applicable,\u201d \nthen the proper venue is presumptively a regional circuit \ncourt. Ibid.; see Texas v. EPA (\u201cTexas 2016\u201d), 829 F.3d \n405, 419, 424 (5th Cir. 2016). If EPA can demonstrate both \nthat a locally applicable action is \u201cbased on a determina-\ntion of nationwide scope or effect\u201d\u2014that is, a textually \ncalled for determination reaching all the nation\u2019s regu-\nlated parties equally\u2014\u201cand\u201d that EPA \u201cf [ound] and pub-\nlishe[d] that such action is based on such a determination,\u201d \nthen venue is proper in the D.C. Circuit. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). \nThe first question for venue, then, is: What is the \u201cfinal \naction \u2026 under this chapter\u201d that EPA was authorized to \ntake? To answer that question, courts \u201clook primarily to \nthe text of the statute,\u201d specifically to the relevant CAA \nprovision that is \u201cthe legal source of [EPA\u2019s] authority to \ntake the challenged action[ ].\u201d Texas v. EPA (\u201cTexas \n2023\u201d), No. 23-60069, 2023 WL 7204840, at *4 (5th Cir. \nMay 1, 2023); see Kentucky, 123 F.4th at 460-462; West \nVirginia v. EPA, 90 F.4th 323, 329 (4th Cir. 2024). \n2. Small-refinery hardship petitions under the \nAct\u2019s RFS Program \na. The CAA\u2019s RFS program requires that increasing \namounts of renewable fuels be blended into the transpor-\ntation fuel (gasoline and diesel) sold in the United States. \n\u00a7 7545(o)(2)(A)(i), (B)(i)(I)-(IV); see HollyFrontier Chey-\nenne Refin., LLC v. Renewable Fuels Ass\u2019n, 594 U.S. 382, \n\n \n11 \n385-387 (2021). EPA first sets annual renewable fuel per-\ncentage standards across the industry. \u00a7 7545(o)(3). Obli-\ngated parties\u2014refiners and importers of transportation \nfuel\u2014use those standards to learn their own annual vol-\nume obligations for each renewable-fuel category. See 40 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 80.1406. \nObligated parties comply with their annual RFS obli-\ngations by \u201cretiring\u201d credits called renewable identifica-\ntion numbers (\u201cRINs\u201d). 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 80.1427. A RIN is \ngenerated when renewable fuel (ethanol, for example) is \nmanufactured. Id. \u00a7 80.1426. The RIN remains attached \nto the volume of renewable fuel until it is blended into \ntransportation fuel, at which point the RIN is \u201csepa-\nrated.\u201d Id. \u00a7\u00a7 80.1428, 80.1429. RINs have a limited life; \nthey can be used for compliance only in the year they are \ngenerated or the next compliance year. \u00a7 7545(o)(5)(C). \nObligated parties demonstrate RFS compliance by secur-\ning sufficient separated RINs, either by generating RINs \nthrough blending renewable fuels or by purchasing RINs \nfrom others that blend. \u00a7 7545(o)(5)(B). \nb. \u201cThe RFS program reflects a carefully crafted leg-\nislative bargain to promote renewable fuels, but also to \nprovide an exemption mechanism for small refineries.\u201d \nSinclair Wyoming Refin. Co. LLC v. EPA, 114 F.4th 693, \n711 (D.C. Cir. 2024). A \u201csmall refinery\u201d has an average \naggregate daily crude oil throughput for a calendar year \nof 75,000 barrels or less. \u00a7 7545(o)(1)(K). Congress recog-\nnized that \u201cescalating [RFS] obligations could work spe-\ncial burdens on small refineries,\u201d many of which \u201clack the \ninherent scale advantages of large refineries\u201d and are lim-\nited in their ability to blend renewable fuels\u2014or are una-\nble to blend at all. HollyFrontier, 594 U.S. at 386 (cleaned \nup). Congress also understood that small refineries are \n\n \n12 \nessential to the nation\u2019s energy supply and often \u201ca major \nsource of jobs in rural communities.\u201d Id. at 386-387. \nEPA has acknowledged that \u201c[m]any\u201d small refineries \n\u201cdo not have access to renewable fuels or the ability to \nblend them, and so must use credits to comply\u201d with the \nRFS. 72 Fed. Reg. 23,900, 23,904 (May 1, 2007). Small  \nrefineries that cannot separate enough RINs through \nblending are forced to buy RINs on an unregulated sec-\nondary market where prices can fluctuate wildly. See 75 \nFed. Reg. 14,670, 14,722 (Mar. 26, 2010) (explaining RIN \nspot markets); HollyFrontier, 594 U.S. at 398 (noting one \nyear where RIN prices \u201cshot up by as much as 100%\u201d). \nCongress initially exempted all small refineries from \nthe RFS until 2011, and it directed the U.S. Department \nof Energy (\u201cDOE\u201d) to study whether RFS compliance \nwould impose disproportionate economic hardship on \nsmall refineries. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(A). DOE completed that \nstudy in 2011, finding that small refineries \u201chave particu-\nlar obstacles that would make compliance more costly \nthan those of large integrated companies.\u201d DOE, Small \nRefinery Exemption Study: An Investigation into Dispro-\nportionate Economic Hardship 3, 32, 37 (March 2011) \n(\u201c2011 DOE Study\u201d).3 DOE also recognized that small  \nrefineries\u2019 hardship would grow increasingly acute as  \nrenewable-fuel blending mandates increased. Id. at 17-18.  \nTo avoid damaging small refineries, Congress created \na permanent safety valve that allows a small refinery to \npetition EPA for an exemption from its annual RFS obli-\ngation \u201cfor the reason of disproportionate economic hard-\nship.\u201d \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(i). The Act provides that \u201c[a] small \nrefinery may at any time petition the Administrator\u201d for \n \n3  https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-12/docu-\nments/small-refinery-exempt-study.pdf. \n\n \n13 \nan exemption\u2014and thus requires each small refinery to \npetition separately for hardship relief. Ibid. (emphasis \nadded). Each granted petition frees only one small refin-\nery from its RFS obligation for the year(s) involved in the \npetition, based on that refinery\u2019s economic circumstances. \n\u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(i)-(ii); 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 80.1441(e)(2). EPA must \ndecide each small-refinery hardship petition in \u201cconsulta-\ntion\u201d with DOE after \u201cconsider[ing] the findings\u201d of DOE\u2019s \n2011 small-refinery study along with \u201cother economic fac-\ntors.\u201d \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(A)-(B). \nCongress required EPA to decide any hardship  \npetition submitted by a small refinery \u201cnot later than 90 \ndays after\u201d receipt, because a small refinery cannot plan \nadequately for RFS compliance until it knows whether it \nhas an obligation. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(iii). But EPA has failed \nto meet that deadline for almost 90 percent of hardship \npetitions submitted since 2013, causing significant uncer-\ntainty for small refineries. See U.S. Government Account-\nability Office, Renewable Fuel Standard: Actions Needed \nto Improve Decision-Making in the Small Refinery Ex-\nemption Program 20, GAO23104273 (Nov. 2022).4 \nc. When EPA has denied small-refinery hardship  \npetitions, the petitioners sometimes sought judicial review. \nRegarding venue for those challenges, EPA repeatedly \nacknowledged that RFS hardship-exemption decisions \nare \u201cquintessentially local action[s]\u201d that must be reviewed \nin the regional circuit courts. E.g., EPA Motion to Dismiss \n18, Advanced Biofuels Ass\u2019n v. EPA, No. 18-1115, Dkt. \n1740614 (D.C. Cir. July 13, 2018). \nOn the merits of those challenges, EPA suffered a \nstreak of losses where circuit courts vacated its hardship \ndecisions. See Sinclair Wyoming Refin. Co. v. EPA, 887 \n \n4  https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-23-104273. \n\n \n14 \nF.3d 986 (10th Cir. 2017); Ergon-West Virginia, Inc. v. \nEPA, 896 F.3d 600 (4th Cir. 2018); Renewable Fuels Ass\u2019n \nv. EPA, 948 F.3d 1206 (10th Cir. 2020); Ergon-West Vir-\nginia, Inc. v. EPA, 980 F.3d 403 (4th Cir. 2020). Frus-\ntrated by its repeated defeats in the regional circuits, and \nafter a 2021 change in presidential administration, EPA \nbegan attempting to eliminate small-refinery hardship  \nrelief altogether. EPA first abandoned defense of its own \nprior decisions granting hardship relief and began newly \ninsisting that a small refinery cannot receive relief unless \nit had received an exemption in every prior compliance \nyear. This Court rejected that new position in HollyFron-\ntier. 594 U.S. at 396-397. \nWhen that effort failed, EPA went back to the drawing \nboard intent on rejecting hardship relief and avoiding  \njudicial review anywhere other than the D.C. Circuit. \nB. The present controversy \n1. The small-refinery respondents here have repeat-\nedly received RFS hardship relief from EPA in the past, \nbecause each of them faces structural disadvantages that \nmake RFS compliance disproportionately burdensome. \nThe respondents petitioned EPA again for hardship relief \nfor some or all of the compliance years 2017 through 2021. \nPet.App.19a nn.26-27. EPA initially granted Wynne-\nwood\u2019s hardship petition for 2017, and it granted Calumet \nShreveport\u2019s, Ergon Refining\u2019s, Placid\u2019s, and Wynne-\nwood\u2019s petitions for 2018. See EPA, Decision on 2018 \nSmall Refinery Exemption Petitions (Aug. 9, 2019).5 \nIn December 2021, however, EPA reversed itself and \nissued a proposal to deny every pending small-refinery \nhardship petition, including by retroactively denying pre-\n \n5 https://www.regulations.gov/comment/EPA-HQ-OAR-2021-\n0566-0077#collapseAttachmentMetadata-ember186 (Tab I). \n\n \n15 \nviously granted petitions. 86 Fed. Reg. 70,999 (Dec. 14, \n2021). EPA proposed to do so by applying multiple sea-\nchanges to the agency\u2019s longstanding approach to hard-\nship petitions. See Proposed Denials.6 EPA also proposed, \nhowever, to continue its existing practice of deciding hard-\nship petitions through agency adjudication, because ap-\nplying a new rulemaking process to hardship petitions \nfrom prior years would have been unlawfully retroactive. \nSee Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hosp., 488 U.S. 204, 208-\n209 (1988). \nEPA\u2019s proposed denials included a new statutory in-\nterpretation and a new \u201ceconomic theory\u201d hypothesizing \nthat \u201cthe RFS program cannot cause [disproportionate \neconomic hardship]\u201d because RIN costs are supposedly \nthe same for all obligated parties regardless of their size, \nbargaining power, location, or blending capability, and  \nbecause obligated parties supposedly universally pass \nthrough 100% of their RIN costs in the price of the fuel \nthey sell. Proposed Denials 11-12 & n.37. Small refineries \ncommented on the proposal, explaining why EPA\u2019s new \nstatutory position was textually unsupportable and why \ntheir individual economic evidence refuted EPA\u2019s hypoth-\nesis that small refineries universally pass on RIN costs. \nE.g., JA 131-275. \nIn April 2022, in the first set of administrative actions \nchallenged here, EPA followed through on its proposal \nand simultaneously denied 36 previously decided hard-\nship petitions (31 of which EPA had previously granted), \nincluding petitions submitted by these respondents. \nPet.App.189a-330a (the \u201cApril Denials\u201d). EPA announced \nit was satisfied that each of the petitioning small refineries \n \n6  EPA, Proposed RFS Small Refinery Exemption Decision \n(Dec. \n2021), \nhttps://www.epa.gov/renewable-fuel-standard-\nprogram/proposal-deny-petitions-small-refinery-exemptions. \n\n \n16 \nwas able to fully pass through its RIN costs in the price of \nits fuel. Id. at 209a-212a. EPA issued each small refinery \na \u201cconfidential, refinery-specific appendi[x]\u201d to the April \nDenials\u2019 explanation document, giving individualized rea-\nsons for its conclusion that each refinery could pass \nthrough 100% of its RFS costs. Id. at 199a. \nIn June 2022, EPA largely copied and pasted its April \nreasoning to announce the denial of another 69 hardship \npetitions, including these small-refinery respondents\u2019  \npetitions for some or all of the 2017 and 2019-2021 years. \nPet.App.44a-188a (the \u201cJune Denials\u201d). The June Denials\u2019 \nexplanation document stated \u201cthat none of the 69 pending \n[small-refinery hardship] petitions for the 2016-2021 com-\npliance years ha[s] demonstrated [disproportionate eco-\nnomic hardship] caused by the cost of compliance with the \nrequirements of the RFS program.\u201d Pet.App.185a. EPA \nagain provided separate \u201cconfidential, refinery-specific \nappendices\u201d explaining its findings on each small refin-\nery\u2019s RIN-cost passthrough. Pet.App.55a. \nThe refinery-specific appendices accompanying the \nApril and June Denials detailed EPA\u2019s individualized  \nassessments of each small refinery\u2019s economic condition. \nFor example, EPA considered whether one respondent \nrefinery could blend enough biodiesel given that it oper-\nates in a market that does not accept biodiesel blends, and \nwhether that refinery faced higher ethanol costs than \nother large refiners and blenders in its area. JA 285-287. \nEPA considered whether another respondent faced \nhigher transportation costs for shipping from terminals \nalong the Gulf Coast. JA 293-295. And EPA considered \nthe price impacts to another respondent from the fact \nthat, in its tri-State region, the small refinery faced dimin-\nished demand for kerosene-based jet fuel and more- \nstringent specifications for ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel. JA \n\n \n17 \n312-313. It was based on individualized, refinery-specific  \nconsiderations like those\u2014how each refinery fits in its \nown local market\u2014that EPA concluded that each of the \npetitioning small refineries \u201cis recovering its [RFS com-\npliance] costs,\u201d and for that reason is not experiencing dis-\nproportionate economic hardship. E.g., JA 280, 286, 298. \nEPA accomplished its bundled denial decisions only \nby ignoring the statutory deadline to decide the hardship \npetitions; it held dozens beyond the 90-day deadline so \nthat it could deny them together and create the appear-\nance of promulgating just two actions. \n2. The small-refinery respondents filed petitions for \njudicial review of EPA\u2019s denials of their RFS hardship  \npetitions. Because the refineries each are headquartered, \nincorporated, or operate within the Fifth Circuit, they \nsought review there. Two groups representing the inter-\nests of the biofuel industry\u2014the respondents in support \nof petitioner here (\u201cBiofuel respondents\u201d)\u2014intervened to \nsupport EPA\u2019s denials of hardship relief. \nEPA moved to dismiss the petitions or transfer them \nto the D.C. Circuit, asserting that because it had bundled \ntogether its hardship-petition denial decisions, they were \n\u201cnationally applicable\u201d or else \u201cbased on a determination \nof nationwide scope or effect.\u201d \u00a7 7607(b)(1). \nThe Fifth Circuit denied EPA\u2019s motions. Pet.App.9a-\n15a. EPA\u2019s actions denying the small refineries\u2019 hardship \npetitions were \u201clocally \u2026 applicable,\u201d not \u201cnationally  \napplicable,\u201d because they affected only the individual  \npetitioning small refineries. Id. at 11a-12a. Nor were \nEPA\u2019s actions based on any nationwide determination. Id. \nat 12a-13a. EPA conceded that it had \u201cconsidered each  \npetition on the merits and individual refinery infor-\nmation.\u201d Id. at 14a (cleaned up). And EPA\u2019s explanation \ndocuments confirm that the agency\u2019s final actions\u2014its  \n\n \n18 \nultimate denials of the hardship-exemption petitions\u2014\n\u201cre[lied] on refinery-specific determinations\u201d about each \nrefinery\u2019s own \u201ceconomic hardship\u201d factors. Id. at 15a. \nOn the merits of the small refineries\u2019 challenges, the \nFifth Circuit explained at length why EPA\u2019s hardship- \ndenial actions were \u201c(1) impermissibly retroactive; \n(2) contrary to law; and (3) counter to the record evi-\ndence.\u201d Pet.App.3a; see id. at 16a-33a. \nThe Biofuel respondents filed petitions for rehearing \nand rehearing en banc. Those were denied. Pet.App.332a-\n333a. \n3. Some other small refineries whose RFS hardship \npetitions were denied as part of EPA\u2019s April and June  \nDenials chose to petition for judicial review only in the \nD.C. Circuit. And still other small refineries filed petitions \nfor review in the regional circuits but had their petitions \ntransferred to the D.C. Circuit\u2014most without a substan-\ntive explanation or opinion. See U.S. Br. 13 & nn.2-3. \nIn July 2024, the D.C. Circuit unanimously agreed \nwith the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \u201canalysis and conclusion\u201d on the \nmerits that EPA\u2019s April and June Denials were \u201ccontrary \nto law\u201d and must be vacated. Sinclair Wyoming, 114 \nF.4th at 706-707 & n.5. The D.C. Circuit also held that the \ndenials were arbitrary and capricious because \u201creality  \nundercuts EPA\u2019s\u201d economic \u201ctheory\u201d that small refineries \ncan universally pass on their RIN costs. Id. at 713. \n \n\n \n19 \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nA. The Fifth Circuit correctly held that EPA\u2019s final \nactions challenged here were locally applicable rather \nthan nationally applicable, and were based on respond-\nents\u2019 local economic circumstances rather than any deter-\nmination of nationwide scope or effect.  \n1. Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s reference to the agency\u2019s \u201cfinal \naction \u2026 under this chapter\u201d indicates that it is the sub-\nstantive CAA text that determines what final actions the \nagency was authorized to take. Whether and how EPA \nchooses to bundle its final actions is irrelevant to venue. \nHere, every part of the relevant provision under the \n\u201cchapter\u201d\u2014especially the singular, definite articles and \nthe deadline for deciding hardship petitions indexed to \neach petition\u2019s submission date\u2014indicates that Congress \ndirected EPA to produce individualized final actions on  \nindividually submitted hardship petitions. \n2. EPA\u2019s individual denials of hardship relief were \nobviously locally appliable rather than nationally applica-\nble. The government does not argue otherwise. Those  \ndecisions on individually submitted petitions affecting \nonly one refinery look nothing like the enumerated nation-\nwide actions in Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s first sentence, but they \nclosely resemble the enumerated locally applicable ac-\ntions in the second sentence. \n3. \u201cDetermination\u201d is a term of art in the CAA. An \nEPA action is based on a determination of nationwide \nscope or effect in the rare instance where the CAA\u2019s text \ndirects EPA to make a \u201cdetermination\u201d about the entire \nnation or industry, without the need to consider individual \ncircumstances. But here, the CAA required EPA to base \nits hardship decisions on each petitioning small refinery\u2019s \nindividual economic hardship factors. And EPA\u2019s own doc-\numents confirm that the agency did just that. \n\n \n20 \nB. The government\u2019s arguments seeking D.C. Circuit \nreview fail. \n1. The government goes astray because it gets the \nrelevant \u201caction\u201d wrong. EPA contends that its denials of \n105 individually submitted hardship petitions were really \njust two actions, asserting that a court may not contest \nEPA\u2019s \u201ccharacterization\u201d of its actions. But it is the text \nof \u201cth[e] chapter,\u201d not EPA, that determines what final \nactions the agency is authorized to take.  \n2. EPA\u2019s argument for national applicability depends \non the Court accepting the agency\u2019s view of the relevant \nunit of administrative action. Even if EPA were correct \nthat the bundled decision announcements were the rele-\nvant actions, those still were not nationally applicable  \nbecause they applied only to those refineries that chose to \npetition for hardship relief, not to the whole nation. EPA \nasserts that any agency action that touches more than one \njudicial circuit is nationally applicable. But that argument \nproduces the absurd result that an expressly regional  \naction for a metropolitan region that happens to encom-\npass two States (and two circuits) would be \u201cnationally ap-\nplicable\u201d and reviewable only by the D.C. Circuit. \n3. Contrary to EPA\u2019s assertion, the hardship denial \nactions were not based on any determination of nation-\nwide scope or effect. \nThe relevant text of the \u201cchapter\u201d here, unlike other \nclosely related provisions, does not call for any \u201cdetermi-\nnation\u201d on a small-refinery hardship petition. EPA\u2019s argu-\nment depends on treating \u201cdetermination\u201d not as a term \nof art but as an amorphous concept of anything that con-\ntributed significantly to an EPA action. \nIn any event, neither EPA\u2019s new interpretation of the \nAct, nor its new RIN-cost-passthrough economic hypoth-\nesis, were \u201cnationwide determinations\u201d that formed the \n\n \n21 \n\u201cbas[is]\u201d for EPA\u2019s hardship denial decisions. Every EPA \naction necessarily rests to some degree on the agency\u2019s \nunderstanding of its statutory authority. And EPA is  \nrequired to apply a \u201cuniform\u201d statutory interpretation to \nsimilarly situated small-refinery petitioners\u2014anything \nelse would have been arbitrary. Moreover, EPA\u2019s new \nstatutory reading could not be the basis for final actions \non respondents\u2019 hardship petitions; EPA expressly did \nnot use a rulemaking here. EPA achieved final actions \nonly by applying its statutory interpretation to respond-\nents\u2019 individual economic facts. \nFor the same reason, even if EPA\u2019s economic theory \ncould qualify as a \u201cdetermination\u201d under the CAA, the  \nfinal actions denying respondents\u2019 hardship petitions \nwere not \u201cbased on\u201d it. Moving beyond hypothesis to final \nactions required EPA to test its prediction against re-\nspondents\u2019 economic evidence. And EPA acknowledges on \nthe face of the denial decisions that it did so. \nEPA\u2019s decisions here do not resemble the unusual \nCAA provision that was the genesis for the nationwide-\ndetermination exception sentence in Section 7607(b)(1).  \nEPA\u2019s appeals to policy cannot overcome the statutory \ntext. And in any event, EPA\u2019s attempt to force dozens of \nsmall refineries to litigate their RFS hardship-denial  \ndecisions together in the D.C. Circuit has served only to  \nobscure judicial consideration of the individual economic \nfactors that the CAA makes the core basis for hardship \nrelief. \n \n \n\n \n22 \nARGUMENT \nSection 7607(b)(1) sets the venue for a petition for  \nreview principally by asking whether the EPA \u201cfinal  \naction\u201d being challenged is nationally applicable or  \nlocally/regionally applicable. Courts identify the relevant \n\u201cfinal action\u201d by examining the substantive text of \u201cth[e] \nchapter\u201d\u2014the CAA. Here the chapter designates the final \nactions as EPA\u2019s denials of small refineries\u2019 individually \nsubmitted RFS hardship petitions. The statutory text \ncalls for individualized consideration of each petitioning \nsmall refinery\u2019s \u201cdisproportionate economic hardship.\u201d \n\u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B). \nOnce EPA\u2019s individual denial decisions are properly \nidentified as the \u201cfinal action[s]\u201d under challenge, their \nnational vs. local applicability is obvious: Those individual \ndenials are, as EPA has always said, \u201cquintessentially  \nlocal action[s]\u201d for Section 7607(b)(1) because they \u201cadju-\ndicate[ ] legal rights as to a single refinery in a single loca-\ntion.\u201d EPA Motion 18, Advanced Biofuels, No. 18-1115, \nsupra. The face of the actions here confirms that EPA \nreached final decisions only by examining refinery-specific \nevidence and reaching refinery-specific conclusions that \nnone of these respondents experiences disproportionate \neconomic hardship from the RFS. Indeed, the statutory \ntext compelled EPA to deny hardship relief based on the \npetitioning small refineries\u2019 own economic circum-\nstances\u2014not any nationwide determination. So the Fifth \nCircuit correctly held that it was the proper venue rather \nthan the D.C. Circuit. \nThe government contends (U.S. Br. 28-29) that these \nhardship-petition denial actions are nationally applica-\nble\u2014unlike all prior hardship decisions\u2014because EPA \nhas \u201ccharacteriz[ed]\u201d them differently. EPA conceives of \nits decisions denying 105 separately submitted hardship \n\n \n23 \npetitions as just two national actions because it chose to \nannounce those denials together. But EPA does not  \ndecide what the relevant \u201cfinal action\u201d is under the CAA\u2014\nthe statute does. The substantive CAA provision at issue \ndesignates each individual hardship decision as the rele-\nvant unit of administrative action, none of which applies in \nmore than one circuit. EPA\u2019s suggestions that any action \nhappening to touch more than one circuit is \u201cnationally  \napplicable,\u201d and that it can manufacture nationally appli-\ncable actions by bundling individual decisions together, \nare inconsistent with the CAA\u2019s text, context, and history, \nas well as common sense. \nAlternatively, EPA claims that these hardship deci-\nsions are locally applicable but based on a new statutory \ninterpretation and economic theory that have nationwide \nscope or effect. Wrong, both times. EPA\u2019s musings about \nits statutory instructions, and its generalized economic \nhypothesis about small refineries\u2019 RIN costs, were merely \nsteps along the way of EPA\u2019s individual-refinery deci-\nsionmaking process. Neither was a \u201cdetermination\u201d\u2014 \na term of art in the CAA\u2014called for by the text. And nei-\nther produced any final agency action. EPA\u2019s final actions \nwere instead expressly based on its conclusions about \neach petitioning small refinery\u2019s economic circumstances. \nEPA itself says it denied respondents\u2019 hardship petitions \nbased on its (erroneous) view that each refinery \u201cis recov-\nering its [RFS compliance] costs.\u201d E.g., JA 280, 286, 298 \n(emphasis added). \nUnder the venue instructions in Section 7607(b)(1),  \nreview of these hardship-petition actions belongs in the \nregional circuit courts\u2014exactly where prior actions on \nsimilar petitions have long been reviewed. The Fifth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s judgment should be affirmed. \n\n \n24 \nA. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision was correct. \nIdentifying the proper venue for judicial review under \nSection 7607(b)(1) involves three questions: (1) What  \n\u201cfinal action\u201d did EPA take \u201cunder\u201d the CAA? (2) Was \nthat final action locally or regionally applicable, as opposed \nto nationally applicable? (3) If so, was the action neverthe-\nless \u201cbased on a determination of nationwide scope or  \neffect\u201d? The Fifth Circuit answered each of those ques-\ntions correctly. \n1. The \u201cfinal action[s]\u201d are EPA\u2019s denials of each \nsmall-refinery\u2019s hardship petition. \na. The parties and the courts of appeals agree that \n\u201cSection 7607(b)(1) categorizes petitions for [judicial]  \nreview according to the nature of the [EPA] action\u201d being \nchallenged. Texas 2016, 829 F.3d at 419; accord U.S. Br. \n20 (citing additional cases). But a court cannot assess an  \naction\u2019s nature until it identifies \u201cwhat \u2018final action\u2019 [it is] \ndealing with.\u201d Kentucky v. EPA, Nos. 23-3216/23-3225, \n2023 WL 11871967, at *2 (6th Cir. July 25, 2023).  \nThe statute helpfully describes how to answer that \nquestion: refer to the \u201cfinal action of [EPA] under this \nchapter.\u201d \u00a7 7607(b)(1) (emphasis added). \u201c[T]his chapter\u201d \nis the CAA. See p. 6, supra. Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s phrase  \n\u201cfinal action \u2026 under this chapter\u201d points the reader to \nthe substantive CAA provision that provides \u201cthe legal \nsource of the agency\u2019s \u2026 authority to take the challenged \nactions.\u201d Texas 2023, 2023 WL 7204840, at *4; see p. 10, \nsupra (additional cases making the same point). \nSection 7607(b)(1)\u2019s overall structure makes this even \nmore clear. By enumerating specific CAA sections author-\nizing national or local/regional actions in the first two sen-\ntences, and then adding a catchall clause to each sentence \nfor \u201cany other\u201d nationally or locally/regionally applicable \naction, the venue provision repeatedly requires cross ref-\n\n \n25 \nerencing the CAA provision that authorized the EPA  \naction under challenge. See Kentucky, 123 F.4th at 461 \n(Section 7607(b)(1) \u201cfocuses on the statute \u2026 to distin-\nguish\u201d national vs. local/regional actions). \nb. The \u201cfinal action\u201d that the CAA authorized here is \nfor EPA to \u201cact on\u201d a small refinery\u2019s individually submit-\nted RFS hardship petition. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B); see Pet.App. \n185a (EPA invoking \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B) as its source of author-\nity). So that is the \u201crelevant unit of administrative action\u201d \nfor venue purposes. Texas 2023, 2023 WL 7204840, at *4.  \nEverything about that substantive text demonstrates \nthat EPA\u2019s final actions on hardship petitions are to be \nindividualized. Every reference in that subsection to the \n\u201cpetition\u201d or the petitioning \u201crefinery\u201d is in the singular: \n\u201cA small refinery may at any time petition\u201d EPA for a \nhardship exemption, based on the \u201creason of dispropor-\ntionate economic hardship\u201d if required to comply with the \nRFS. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(i) (emphasis added). EPA must \n\u201cevaluat[e] a petition,\u201d considering the findings of the \n2011 DOE small-refinery study and other economic fac-\ntors. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(ii) (emphasis added). Whether a par-\nticular petitioning small refinery is experiencing dis-\nproportionate economic hardship from the RFS in a given \nyear is necessarily an individualized inquiry focused on \nthat refinery\u2019s own economic circumstances.  \nCongress also provided that the statutory deadline for \nEPA to \u201cact on any [small-refinery hardship] petition\u201d is \nindexed to each petition: \u201cnot later than 90 days after the \ndate of receipt of the petition.\u201d \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(iii). That \nprovision forcefully confirms that Congress directed EPA \nto produce individualized actions on hardship petitions; \nthe rolling, refinery-specific deadlines would make no \nsense otherwise. Cf. Kentucky, 123 F.4th at 461 (EPA\u2019s \nobligation \u201cto \u2018act\u2019 on each State\u2019s \u2018submission\u2019 on a plan-\n\n \n26 \nby-plan basis within a specified time\u201d indicates those  \nactions are locally rather than nationally applicable) (cita-\ntion omitted). And as mentioned above (p. 17, supra), EPA \nwas able to produce bundled hardship decisions only by \ndeliberately ignoring the CAA\u2019s decision deadline. \nThe broader statutory context also shows that Con-\ngress did not intend its \u201csingular\u201d definite and indefinite \narticles in this subsection to \u201cinclude and apply to several \npersons, parties, or things.\u201d Contra U.S. Br. 26 (quoting \n1 U.S.C. \u00a7 1). Congress initially granted a blanket exemp-\ntion from the RFS through 2011 to all \u201csmall refineries\u201d\u2014\nplural. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(A)(i). Congress then directed EPA to \nextend that exemption for another two years on an indi-\nvidualized basis to only \u201ca\u201d small refinery that DOE  \ndetermined would face disproportionate economic hard-\nship from the RFS. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(A)(ii)(II). After that, Con-\ngress transitioned to the current petition-based approach. \n\u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B). The statute now puts the onus on each \nsmall refinery to request hardship relief based on its own \n\u201cdisproportionate economic hardship.\u201d \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(i). \nCongress knew how to authorize blanket or multiple  \nexemption actions, but it did not do so here. Congress  \ninstead directed EPA to \u201cact on\u201d \u201cthe petition\u201d \u201csubmit-\nted by a small refinery.\u201d \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(iii) (emphases \nadded). \nc. Federal courts\u2019 practice also reflects the reality \nthat EPA\u2019s individual hardship-exemption decisions are \nthe final actions for venue purposes. When the Fifth Cir-\ncuit below held that EPA\u2019s denial decisions were unlawful, \nit did not vacate all 105 EPA denial decisions, despite the \ngovernment\u2019s urging that it had produced just two na-\ntional actions. Instead, the Fifth Circuit properly vacated \nonly the denial decisions for the small refineries before it. \nPet.App.34a. \n\n \n27 \nIn another recent case involving subsequent small- \nrefinery hardship decisions that EPA bundled together, \nthe government moved the D.C. Circuit to act separately \non the denial decisions for particular refineries\u2014to vacate \nsome final actions in EPA\u2019s bundle but not others. See \nCalumet Montana Refin., LLC v. EPA, No. 23-1194, Dkt. \n2081226 (Oct. 21, 2024); see id., Dkt. 2091139 (Dec. 23, \n2024) (D.C. Circuit granting limited vacatur in accord with \nEPA\u2019s request). That motion confirms EPA\u2019s agreement \nthat, even when it bundles small-refinery hardship deci-\nsions together, courts review the individual final actions \nthat apply to each refinery. And EPA would surely take \nthe position that each denied refinery must file a petition \nfor review to obtain judicial review at all. \n* \nThe relevant \u201cfinal action[s]\u201d for venue purposes are \nthus EPA\u2019s decisions on each small refinery\u2019s hardship \npetition, regardless of EPA\u2019s choice to bundle its petition  \ndecisions. Accord Kentucky, 123 F.4th at 460-463 (reject-\ning EPA\u2019s argument that its consolidated disapprovals of \n21 state implementation plans constituted a single action). \nOnce the action is properly identified, it \u201cmakes this case \neasy.\u201d Id. at 461. EPA\u2019s individual denial decisions are  \nobviously locally/regionally applicable\u2014the government \ndoesn\u2019t try to argue otherwise. And those decisions did \nnot involve any nationwide \u201cdetermination\u201d called for by \nthe CAA. Rather, each was based (as they must be per the \nAct) on EPA\u2019s refinery-specific evaluations of each peti-\ntioning small refinery\u2019s own economic hardship factors\u2014\nthings like local-market acceptance of renewable fuel, \npercentage of diesel production, access to capital, etc. See, \ne.g., JA 280, 285-287, 293-298. \n\n \n28 \n2. EPA\u2019s denials of the hardship petitions are \u201clocally \nor regionally applicable\u201d actions. \na. The venue provision\u2019s \u201capplicability\u201d inquiry\u2014 \nnationally vs. locally/regionally applicable\u2014asks about \n\u201cthe location of the persons or enterprises that the action \nregulates.\u201d Texas v. EPA, No. 10-60961, 2011 WL 710598, \nat *3 (5th Cir. Feb. 24, 2011) (quoting New York v. EPA, \n133 F.3d 987, 990 (7th Cir. 1998)). Multiple courts of  \nappeals have agreed, at the government\u2019s urging, that \nwhat matters is \u201cthe face of \u201d the action, American Road, \n705 F.3d at 456 (Kavanaugh, J.), not the action\u2019s reasoning \nor practical \u201ceffects,\u201d ATK Launch, 651 F.3d at 1197.  \nAccord U.S. Br. 20-21 (citing additional cases).7 \nThe \u201c \u2018ordinary meaning\u2019 \u201d of the \u201ckey words\u201d in Sec-\ntion 7607(b)(1)\u2019s first sentence\u2014\u201c \u2018nationally applicable \nregulations promulgated, or final action taken\u2019 by the \nEPA\u201d\u2014\u201cconvey[s] that the challenged regulations or  \naction must apply to the entire country.\u201d Kentucky, 123 \nF.4th at 459 (emphasis added; citations omitted). The \nSixth Circuit\u2019s Kentucky opinion gives the relevant dic-\ntionary definitions, see ibid., though it\u2019s \u201cdoubt[ful] that \nwe need dictionaries for this point,\u201d ibid. The word \u201cna-\ntionally\u201d refers to an EPA action affecting the \u201cnation as \na whole.\u201d Ibid. (citation omitted). \nTwo different canons of construction confirm that  \ninterpretation. The first is ejusdem generis. See Ken-\ntucky, 123 F.4th at 460. Because the phrase \u201cnationally \napplicable\u201d comes in a catchall clause following an enu-\nmerated list of national CAA actions, courts determine \n \n7  Biofuel respondents\u2019 alternative theory (Br. 21)\u2014that the \nkey to venue is what arguments might be raised in a petition \nfor review challenging the agency action\u2014has been repeatedly \nrejected. It is contrary to the textual instruction to look to the \n\u201cfinal action \u2026 under this chapter.\u201d \u00a7 7607(b)(1). \n\n \n29 \nthe meaning of \u201cnationally applicable\u201d by reference to the \nenumerated actions. Ibid. (citing Bissonnette v. LePage \nBakeries Park St., LLC, 601 U.S. 246, 252 (2024)). And the \nfirst sentence\u2019s enumerated CAA actions all \u201chave nation-\nwide applicability,\u201d ibid.: They regulate across the whole \nnation without individualized consideration, and they  \napply irrespective of whether any party requested agency \naction or not. By contrast, the enumerated locally applica-\nble actions in Section 7607(b)(1) involve individual regu-\nlated entities or States. Finding a \u201cnationally applicable\u201d \naction for purposes of the catchall clause thus requires \nidentifying an EPA final action that similarly affects the \nentire nation, irrespective of a party\u2019s local circumstances. \nSecond, \u201ccourts presume that Congress means to \nadopt \u2018clear boundaries\u2019 in \u2018jurisdictional statutes\u2019 to avoid \nwasteful litigation over the proper forum.\u201d Kentucky, 123 \nF.4th at 460 (quoting Direct Mktg. Ass\u2019n v. Brohl, 575 \nU.S. 1, 11 (2015), and citing other cases). The courts of  \nappeals have agreed that Section 7607(b)(1) is a venue \nprovision rather than a jurisdictional one.8 But the basic \npoint is the same: No one\u2019s interests are served by com-\nplex disputes over venue. Clear boundaries are set by giv-\ning \u201cnationally applicable\u201d its ordinary meaning: An EPA \nfinal action is \u201cnationally applicable\u201d for purposes of  \nSection 7607(b)(1) when it governs the entire nation, as  \nopposed to when it governs some lesser subset of regu-\nlated parties, States, or regions. \nb. In the context of the RFS program, the CAA  \nauthorizes EPA to take some national actions and some \nlocal actions. For example: When EPA publishes annual \n \n8  See Texas 2016, 829 F.3d at 418; Dalton Trucking, Inc. v. \nEPA, 808 F.3d 875, 879 (D.C. Cir. 2015); Clean Water Action \nCouncil of Ne. Wis., Inc. v. EPA, 765 F.3d 749, 751 (7th Cir. \n2014). \n\n \n30 \nrenewable-fuel blending-volume obligations for the indus-\ntry, that is a nationally applicable action, and any chal-\nlenge to it goes to the D.C. Circuit. See, e.g., Americans \nfor Clean Energy v. EPA, 864 F.3d 691 (D.C. Cir. 2017). \nThat\u2019s because EPA\u2019s volumes rule affects every RFS-\nobligated party in the nation.  \nBut when EPA decides a small refinery\u2019s RFS hard-\nship petition, that is a \u201cquintessentially local action,\u201d as \nEPA itself has previously (correctly) put it. EPA Motion \n18, Advanced Biofuels, No. 18-1115, supra. Hardship  \ndecisions look nothing like the national actions enumer-\nated in Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s first sentence, but they closely \nresemble the individualized decisions enumerated in the \nsecond sentence. Hardship decisions do not regulate the \nwhole nation or industry; they \u201cinvolve only the regulation \nof \u201d individual facilities\u2019 requests for relief and \u201chave legal \nconsequences only for [those] facilities.\u201d Texas 2023, 2023 \nWL 7204840, at *5; see West Virginia Chamber of Com-\nmerce v. Browner, 166 F.3d 336 (4th Cir. 1998) (finding it \n\u201cclearly regionally applicable\u201d \u201cwhen the EPA \u2026 makes \na determination with respect to a particular facility\u201d). \nAs EPA has previously explained: Each of the small-\nrefinery respondents\u2019 hardship petitions \u201conly requested \nrelief for one refinery.\u201d EPA Reply in Support of Motion \nto Dismiss 2, Lion Oil Co. v. EPA, No. 14-3405, Dkt. \n4227218 (8th Cir. Dec. 17, 2014). And each denial action \nwas a \u201cdecision with respect to a particular small refin-\nery\u2019s request\u201d that \u201cadjudicates legal rights as to that sin-\ngle refinery in its single location.\u201d U.S. Br. 15, Producers \nof Renewables United for Integrity Truth and Transpar-\nency v. EPA (\u201cPRUITT\u201d), No. 18-1202, Dkt. 1775897 \n(D.C. Cir. Mar. 4, 2019). \nThat is why EPA has repeatedly argued that RFS \nhardship decisions are locally applicable for Section \n\n \n31 \n7607(b)(1), before EPA began attempting to manufacture \nvenue in the D.C. Circuit by bundling decisions together. \nE.g., PRUITT, No. 18-1202, supra; EPA Response 2,  \nRenewable Fuels Ass\u2019n v. EPA, No. 18-9533, Dkt. 35 (10th \nCir. July 12, 2018) (\u201cvenue is proper in this Court\u201d); U.S. \nBr. 2-3, Ergon-West Virginia, Inc. v. EPA, Nos. 19-2128, \n19-2148, 19-2152 (consol.), Dkt. 64 (4th Cir. May 28, 2020) \n(challenge to denied hardship petition \u201cproperly venued\u201d \nin Fourth Circuit \u201cbecause the action is locally or region-\nally applicable\u201d). \n3. EPA\u2019s actions were based on local economic facts, \nnot any nationwide statutory determination. \na. Because EPA\u2019s denials of respondents\u2019 RFS hard-\nship petitions are \u201clocally or regionally applicable ac-\ntion[s],\u201d the text of Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s third sentence \npresumptively \u201crequires review in th[e] [regional] cir-\ncuit.\u201d Texas 2016, 829 F.3d at 424; see Kentucky, 2023 WL \n11871967, at *3. EPA can overcome that presumption only \nby demonstrating that its denials were \u201cbased on a deter-\nmination of nationwide scope or effect.\u201d \u00a7 7607(b)(1); see \npp. 8-10, supra. \nThe courts of appeals broadly agree that the scope and \neffect of EPA\u2019s determinations are reviewed \u201cde novo\u201d \nand without deference to the agency. Texas 2016, 829 F.3d \nat 421 (5th Cir.); see Sierra Club, 47 F.4th at 746 (D.C. \nCir.); Dalton Trucking, Inc. v. EPA, 808 F.3d 875, 881 \n(D.C. Cir. 2015). The third-sentence exception applies \nonly \u201cif [the] action is based on a determination of nation-\nwide scope or effect and if in taking such action the Ad-\nministrator finds and publishes that such action is based \non such a determination.\u201d \u00a7 7607(b)(1) (emphases added). \nIt does not suffice for EPA to find and publish a nation-\nwide-effect conclusion; the action must actually be based \non a determination of nationwide scope or effect and EPA \n\n \n32 \nmust publish that finding. The first of those independent \n\u201ctwo conditions\u201d (unlike the second) makes no reference \nto what EPA finds or publishes, so it is a legal question for \nthe courts. Texas 2016, 829 F.3d at 421; see Sierra Club, \n47 F.4th at 746; see also Loper Bright Enterprises v. Rai-\nmondo, 603 U.S. 369 (2024). \nBoth the text and history of Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s third \nsentence show that, to trigger the exception, the relevant \nsubstantive CAA provision must textually direct EPA to \nmake a \u201cdetermination\u201d for the entire nation\u2014i.e., the \nkind of determination that does not depend on individual \ncircumstances. See pp. 8-9, supra. That was the kind of \nstatutory determination identified by EPA General Coun-\nsel Frick that the government agrees (U.S. Br. 18) \nprompted Congress to add the third sentence to Section \n7607(b)(1). And the government further agrees (U.S. Br. \n31) that Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s \u201cbased on\u201d formulation means \nthe relevant EPA determination cannot be \u201cperipheral or \nextraneous\u201d but must \u201clie at the core of the agency  \naction.\u201d Texas 2016, 829 F.3d at 419. \nThe CAA is littered with provisions requiring \u201cdeter-\nminations\u201d as the basis for final actions. In fact, more than \nhalf of the CAA\u2019s sections call for at least one determina-\ntion before EPA can act. See generally 42 U.S.C. Ch. 85. \nCongress\u2019s repeated use of the term \u201cdetermination\u201d or \nits derivatives throughout the Act indicates it is a term of \nart with the same meaning in Section 7607(b)(1). See  \nMohamad v. Palestinian Auth., 566 U.S. 449, 456 (2012). \nSo courts do not apply Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s third sentence \nby asking generally about the inputs or processes for an \nEPA action; they look to whether the statutory text called \nfor taking that action on the basis of a specific kind of  \ndetermination. See Kentucky, 123 F.4th at 463-464 (\u201cWhen \nused to describe a ruling from an \u2018administrative agency,\u2019 \n\n \n33 \n\u2018determination\u2019 has a more precise \u2018legal meaning\u2019 \u201d that \ndoes \u201cnot\u201d refer to \u201ceach preliminary step on the road to \n[the agency\u2019s] decision.\u201d) (citation omitted). \nb. EPA\u2019s denials of the small-refinery respondents\u2019 \nhardship petitions were not based on any statutory deter-\nminations of nationwide scope or effect.  \ni. That is so, first, because the relevant CAA provi-\nsion here (\u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)) does not call for any determi-\nnation at all. Unlike the immediately preceding subsection \nand other subsections within the same section, subsection \n7545(o)(9)(B) does not use the phrase \u201cdetermination\u201d or \n\u201cdetermines.\u201d It instead invites a small refinery to peti-\ntion for relief \u201cfor the reason of disproportionate economic \nhardship,\u201d and it says that EPA should \u201cevaluat[e]\u201d that \nhardship petition in consultation with DOE after consid-\nering DOE\u2019s 2011 study and \u201cother economic factors.\u201d \nThere are no statutory \u201cdetermination[s]\u201d in that process. \nTo the extent Section 7545(o)(9)(B) contemplates any \nstatutory determination at all, it calls for a determination \nthat has a local scope and effect. After the blanket RFS \nexemption for small refineries ended in 2011, Congress  \ndirected EPA to extend an exemption for at least two \nmore years \u201c[i]n the case of a small refinery that the Sec-\nretary of Energy determines \u2026 would be subject to a dis-\nproportionate economic hardship if required to comply \nwith\u201d the RFS. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(A)(ii)(II) (emphases added). \nNo longer did all small refineries nationwide get the  \nexemption; only those specific small refineries that were  \ndetermined to face disproportionate economic hardship. \nThat provision required EPA to grant exemptions based \non DOE\u2019s local determination that a particular small  \nrefinery would face hardship. \n \n\n \n34 \nCongress then provided in the very next subsection\u2014\nthe one at issue here\u2014that \u201c[a] small refinery may at any \ntime petition [EPA] for an extension of the exemption  \nunder subparagraph (A) for the reason of disproportion-\nate economic hardship.\u201d \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(i). The reference \nback to \u201csubparagraph (A)\u201d indicates that, when EPA \nconsiders a small refinery\u2019s hardship petition, it must \nmake the same individualized hardship determinations \nthat drove the earlier regime. \nThe plain text of \u201cth[e] chapter\u201d thus compels EPA\u2019s \nhardship decisions to be \u201cbased on\u201d an economic analysis \nfor \u201ca\u201d petitioning small refinery that is local in scope and \neffect. \u00a7 7607(b)(1); \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(i). EPA has said the \nsame thing: the Act \u201cgive[s] EPA the authority to grant \n[a hardship] petition only when a small refinery demon-\nstrates it is experiencing [hardship] caused by compliance \nwith the RFS program.\u201d Pet.App.185a. That must be the \ncore basis for any final action on a hardship petition. \nii. Moreover, the record here shows that EPA in fact \nbased its final actions denying hardship relief on just such \nindividualized conclusions. EPA explained that it had \n\u201ccompleted a thorough evaluation of the data and infor-\nmation provided in the [hardship] petitions, supplemental \nsubmissions, and comments to determine if any of the  \npetitioners have demonstrated that the cost of compliance \nwith the RFS is the cause of their alleged [hardship].\u201d \nPet.App.94a-95a. EPA then found \u201cthat none of the\u201d \npending petitions had \u201cdemonstrated [hardship] caused \nby the cost of compliance with the requirements of the \nRFS program.\u201d Pet.App.185a; accord U.S. Br. 10 (\u201cEPA  \ndetermined that none of the petitioning small refineries \nhad rebutted [the RIN-cost-passthrough] presumption \nthrough evidence about their specific circumstances.\u201d). \n\n \n35 \nTo be sure, EPA had hypothesized in the proposed  \ndenials, before its final actions, that no small refinery \nwould suffer hardship from the RFS because each could \nfully pass through its RIN costs. But that was merely a \nhypothesis. EPA called it then an \u201ceconomic theory,\u201d \nPet.App.212a n.42, 251a; and calls it now (U.S. Br. 8) a \u201cre-\nbuttable presumption.\u201d Whatever it\u2019s called, for EPA to \ntest its hypothesis\u2014to move beyond theory and produce \nfinal agency action on the hardship petitions\u2014EPA con-\ncedes that it needed to, and did, \u201ccarefully review[ ] data, \n[fuel-sales] contracts, and other information from small \nrefineries.\u201d Pet.App.98a-99a. It was only then that EPA \nconcluded (erroneously) that each small refinery actually \n\u201cis recovering its [RFS compliance] costs,\u201d e.g., JA 280, \n286, 298, and for that reason does not face economic hard-\nship, Pet.App.100a. \n* \nBoth the statutory text and record confirm that EPA \ntook these final actions \u201cbased on\u201d conclusions that none \nof the small-refinery respondents would experience  \ndisproportionate economic hardship from the RFS. \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1). Even if those conclusions could qualify as \n\u201cdeterminations\u201d at all, they were local determinations \nbased on an analysis of each refinery\u2019s local evidence, not \nany \u201cdetermination of nationwide scope or effect.\u201d Ibid. \nB. EPA\u2019s arguments seeking D.C. Circuit review fail. \nDespite EPA\u2019s longtime position that its final actions \non hardship petitions are reviewable only in the regional \ncircuit courts, EPA now argues that these denial decisions \nwere nationally applicable, or else were based on a deter-\nmination of nationwide scope or effect. EPA is wrong on \nboth points. \n\n \n36 \n1. EPA gets the \u201caction\u201d wrong. \nEPA does not attempt to argue that its individual \nhardship-petition decisions\u2014as opposed to its bundled  \nexplanations in the April and June Denials of its reasons \nfor denying those petitions\u2014were nationally applicable. \nEPA\u2019s argument thus hangs on this Court being willing to \ncredit its assertion that it produced just two final actions. \nBut the statute shows EPA is wrong about that. It is the \nchapter\u2019s text, not EPA, that establishes what qualifies as \nthe relevant \u201caction\u201d \u201cunder\u201d the CAA. Texas 2023, 2023 \nWL 7204840, at *4. \na. EPA\u2019s brief offers no real attempt to analyze the \nfirst critical phrase in Section 7607(b)(1): \u201cfinal action \u2026 \nunder this chapter.\u201d The government says (U.S. Br. 28-\n29) all that matters is \u201cEPA\u2019s characterization of its own \nagency action\u201d and that courts may not \u201csecond-guess \nEPA\u2019s own framing.\u201d But all agree it is the nature of the \nadministrative action that matters for venue. See pp. 22-\n23, supra. And nothing in the statute gives EPA the power \nto alter the nature of administrative actions just by choos-\ning how to publish those actions (grouped together vs.  \nindividual announcements). EPA\u2019s argument calls back to \nan era before this Court held squarely that \u201ccourts, not \nagencies,\u201d determine \u201cthe meaning of statutory provi-\nsions.\u201d Loper Bright, 603 U.S. at 392, 394. \nThe Sixth Circuit recently explained why it rejected \nthe same argument advanced by the government here: \nthat EPA\u2019s choice of framing, rather than the statutory \ntext, controls what counts as the final action. See Ken-\ntucky, 123 F.4th at 460-463. \u201cThe \u2018structure\u2019 of the judicial-\nreview provision \u2026 focuses on the statute\u201d\u2014not on how \nEPA chose to report its decisions\u2014\u201cto distinguish the \nEPA actions that parties must challenge in the D.C. Cir-\ncuit from those they must challenge in regional circuits.\u201d \n\n \n37 \nId. at 461 (quoting Engine Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. South Coast Air \nQuality Mgmt. Dist., 541 U.S. 246, 252 (2004)). Congress\u2019s \nown designation in Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s first two sen-\ntences of enumerated actions as either nationally applica-\nble or locally applicable, combined with catchall phrases \nfor each sentence, indicates it is the Act, not EPA, that \ngives an action its nature. See ibid. \nEPA\u2019s invocation (U.S. Br. 28) of \u201cthe face of the final \naction\u201d does not advance the analysis. \u201cTh[at] argument \nconflates the [explanation] issued\u201d for EPA\u2019s hardship-\ndenial decisions \u201cwith the \u2018final action\u2019 that the EPA \ntakes.\u201d Kentucky, 123 F.4th at 462 (quoting \u00a7 7607(b)(1)). \nSmall-refinery respondents\u2019 position does not depend on \nthe contents of any petitioner\u2019s court challenge to the \nEPA action or on downstream effects. Venue depends,  \ninstead, on whether the text of the chapter shows the chal-\nlenged action on its face to be more like Section \n7607(b)(1)\u2019s enumerated nationally applicable actions \n(governing the whole nation) or more like the enumerated \nlocally applicable actions that resolve individual parties\u2019 \nrights or obligations. \nb. None of that calls into question EPA\u2019s \u201cfree[dom] \nto fashion [its] own rules of procedure,\u201d including \n\u201c \u2018whether applications should be heard contemporane-\nously or successively.\u2019 \u201d U.S. Br. 26-27 (quoting FCC v. \nPottsville Broad. Co., 309 U.S. 134, 138 (1940)). That free-\ndom includes the \u201cprocess\u201d for taking action; for example, \nthe freedom (where the law permits) to choose between \n\u201crulemaking, individual adjudication, or a combination of \nthe two.\u201d NAACP v. Federal Power Comm\u2019n, 425 U.S. \n662, 668 (1976). EPA could have conducted a rulemaking \nto establish a new interpretation of Section 7545(o)(9)(B) \nand new adjudicatory framework, and such a rule would \nlikely have been nationally applicable. But a new rule like \n\n \n38 \nthat would have needed to be prospective only, see p. 15, \nsupra, which did not meet EPA\u2019s goal here to issue long-\noverdue decisions denying previously submitted small- \nrefinery hardship petitions from prior years.  \nRespondents\u2019 position thus does not disturb EPA\u2019s \nchoice whether to proceed by rulemaking versus adjudi-\ncation. EPA will retain flexibility in running its future \nhardship decisionmaking processes, so long as it examines \neach small refinery\u2019s evidence and adheres to the statu-\ntory decision deadline for final action on each petition. \nWhat EPA may not do is what it attempted here: disre-\ngard whether the CAA\u2019s text calls for local rather than \nnational action. Contrary to EPA\u2019s assertion (U.S. Br. \n26-27), respondents\u2019 textual analysis does not rely merely \non \u201can indefinite article.\u201d As described above (pp. 24-27,  \nsupra), every relevant part of the text and structure of \nSection 7545(o)(9) confirms that Congress wanted RFS \nhardship decisions to be individualized. Cf. Kentucky, 123 \nF.4th at 461 (\u201cthe disapproval of each state plan qualifies \nas a distinct \u2018action\u2019 \u201d). \n2. EPA fails to establish that the hardship decisions \nare nationally applicable. \nWith EPA\u2019s misidentification of the relevant final  \naction corrected, the errors in its remaining arguments \nbecome clear. EPA\u2019s April and June 2022 explanation doc-\numents asserted that the agency had taken nationally  \napplicable actions for two reasons. First, EPA announced \ntogether the denial of hardship petitions submitted by  \nrefineries located in different circuits. Pet.App.185a-188a \n(June 2022 announcement: \u201cThis final action denies 69  \npetitions \u2026 for over 30 small refineries across the coun-\ntry[.]\u201d); Pet.App.327a-330a (similar for April 2022 an-\nnouncement). Second, EPA applied its new statutory \ninterpretation and new economic passthrough hypothesis \n\n \n39 \nto all hardship petitions that the agency adjudicated. E.g., \nPet.App.187a-188a (\u201cEPA\u2019s revised interpretation of the \nrelevant CAA provisions and the RIN discount and RIN \ncost passthrough principles \u2026 are applicable to all small \nrefineries.\u201d). \na. Although EPA defended the second venue argu-\nment in its certiorari petition, U.S. Pet. 10 (arguing that \nthe Denials \u201care \u2018nationally applicable\u2019 because they apply \na uniform methodology to small refineries\u201d), it has now \nabandoned it, making only the geographic argument here. \nU.S. Br. 19-24. Rightly so. Looking to the legal standard \nor reasoning applied would contradict EPA\u2019s long-held \nposition\u2014accepted by multiple courts of appeals\u2014that \nonly \u201cthe face\u201d of the challenged action matters for venue, \nnot the action\u2019s reasoning or effects. See p. 28, supra.9 \nb. EPA\u2019s argument that the actions here were nation-\nally applicable because of geography rests on two errone-\nous premises. First, as discussed just above in Part B.1, it \nwrongly assumes the relevant \u201cactions\u201d are the two docu-\nments explaining EPA\u2019s reasons for denying 105 individ-\nually submitted hardship petitions. \u201c[T]hrow[ing] a \nblanket labeled \u2018national\u2019 over [105] individual decisions\u201d \ndoes not \u201cconvert\u201d them \u201cinto \u2026 national one[s].\u201d West \nVirginia, 90 F.4th at 330. That is especially so when EPA \n \n9  Biofuel respondents\u2019 argument (at Br. 36) that \u201csmall- \nrefinery exemption decisions\u201d are \u201cinherently nationally appli-\ncable\u201d because they affect \u201cthe amount of renewable fuel that \nobligated parties must inject into the nation\u2019s transportation-\nfuel supply\u201d fails for the same reason. The \u201capplicability\u201d in-\nquiry is unconcerned with the \u201cpractical effects\u201d of the EPA \naction. American Road, 705 F.3d at 456 (Kavanaugh, J.). Espe-\ncially a downstream issue like whether EPA chooses to adjust \nvolume obligations for other parties based on outcomes of small \nrefineries\u2019 hardship petitions. \n\n \n40 \nwas able to get all of these individual decisions under its \npurportedly \u201cnational\u201d blanket only by refusing to follow \nthe CAA\u2019s 90-day deadline for answering the hardship  \npetitions. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(iii). Courts generally \u201cwill not \nsuffer a party to profit by his own wrongdoing.\u201d United \nStates v. Houlihan, 92 F.3d 1271, 1279 (1st Cir. 1996). And \nthe government \u201cshould turn square corners in dealing \nwith the people.\u201d Department of Homeland Sec. v.  \nRegents of the Univ. of California, 591 U.S. 1, 24 (2020)  \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \nSecond, EPA now reads the statutory phrase \u201cthe  \nappropriate circuit\u201d to mean that \u201cany action that spans \nmore than one judicial circuit is properly viewed as \u2018na-\ntionally applicable\u2019 and subject to review only in the D.C. \nCircuit.\u201d U.S. Br. 21-22 (quoting \u00a7 7607(b)(1)). According \nto the government (U.S. Br. 21), \u201c[t]he statute\u2019s use of the \ndefinite article \u2026 indicates that, for any given locally or \nregionally applicable EPA action, there is only one appro-\npriate regional court of appeals in which to seek review.\u201d \nThat reading is incorrect. \nNothing in Section 7607(b)(1) indicates that the phrase \n\u201cthe appropriate circuit\u201d informs the meaning of \u201cnation-\nally applicable,\u201d and the plain meaning of \u201cnationally  \napplicable\u201d contradicts EPA\u2019s reading. \u201cNationally\u201d \nmeans \u201cwith regard to the nation as a whole.\u201d Nationally, \nTHE OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY (1971); see Ken-\ntucky, 123 F.4th at 459 (same). Yet on EPA\u2019s reading, an \naction applying to far less than the whole nation\u2014say, one \napplying only to Mississippi and Alabama\u2014would be  \n\u201cnationally applicable.\u201d That is a stretch, to say the least. \nEven accepting arguendo EPA\u2019s view of the relevant \nfinal action, the April and June 2022 Denials were not \u201cna-\ntionally applicable\u201d because they did not cover the whole \nnation like the enumerated actions in Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s \n\n \n41 \nfirst sentence do. They applied to (and bound) only those \nsmall refineries that petitioned for an exemption. See \nPet.App.11a-12a.  \nThe ordinary meaning of \u201cregionally applicable\u201d also \nrebuts EPA\u2019s proffered reading, because that term con-\ntemplates agency actions applying in multiple places \nwithin a region: \u201cof or pertaining to, or connected with, a \nparticular region.\u201d Regional, THE OXFORD ENGLISH \nDICTIONARY (1971). Indeed, EPA\u2019s attempt to put so \nmuch weight on a single definite article produces textually \nabsurd results. Consider EPA\u2019s 250 air quality control  \nregions, some of which cover large metropolitan areas \nthat happen to cross State (and circuit) lines.10 \u201cMetropol-\nitan St. Louis\u201d (Region 70) and \u201cMetropolitan Kansas City\u201d \n(Region 90) are two examples. Can there be any doubt \nthat an EPA disapproval of a regional implementation \nplan for only Region 90 (Metropolitan Kansas City) is a \n\u201cregionally applicable\u201d action for purposes of Section \n7607(b)(1), even though that action touches both the \nEighth and Tenth Circuits? \nCongress did not think so. The 1970 Senate Report  \ninvoked by the government (U.S. Br. 23) said that \u201cimple-\nmentation plans which run only to one air quality control \nregion\u201d should be reviewed in the circuit court \u201cin which \nthe affected air quality control region, or portion thereof, \nis located.\u201d S. Rep. No. 1196, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 41 (1970) \n(emphasis added). Yet according to the government (U.S. \nBr. 22), the circuit courts governing the States affected by \na Kansas City regional action are powerless because \u201cany \naction that spans more than one judicial circuit\u201d must go \nexclusively to the D.C. Circuit. \n \n10 \nSee \nhttps://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/documents/codeta-\nbles/aqcrs.html. \n\n \n42 \nThe Senate Report supports what ordinary usage sug-\ngests about the meaning of \u201cthe appropriate circuit.\u201d \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1) (emphasis added). The use of \u201cthe appropri-\nate circuit\u201d rather than \u201cthe appropriate circuit(s)\u201d re-\nflects merely that Congress often doesn\u2019t legislate with \nlaser-like precision. E.g., United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. \n336, 344 (1971) (\u201cwe cannot pretend that all statutes are \nmodel statutes\u201d). For most EPA final actions (properly \nidentified), it will be readily apparent whether the action \napplies to the whole nation or to some subset\u2014and in the \nlatter instance, which circuit court is \u201cappropriate.\u201d That \nis certainly true for EPA\u2019s RFS hardship decisions, which \naffect only individual small refineries. \nc. Taken together, EPA\u2019s arguments reveal the \nagency\u2019s conscious desire for the power to choose where \nits actions are reviewed. EPA says (U.S. Br. 28-29) that \n\u201caction \u2026 under this chapter\u201d means its own \u201ccharacteri-\nzation\u201d of an action, which courts cannot \u201csecond-guess.\u201d \nAnd EPA further says (U.S. Br. 22) that any time an  \naction affects states or parties in more than one circuit, it \nis automatically entitled to D.C. Circuit review. If EPA \nwere right about both, then the agency could nearly al-\nways manufacture venue in the D.C. Circuit. EPA could \nsimply mush together two small refineries\u2019 RFS hardship \ndecisions, or decisions on two States\u2019 implementation \nplans\u2014even two decisions that have nothing to do with \neach other\u2014and thereby deny the regulated parties the \nopportunity for review by a regional circuit court. \nThe text of Section 7607(b)(1) does not allow that  \nmanipulation. \u201c[V]enue provisions in Acts of Congress \nshould not be so freely construed as to give the Govern-\nment the choice of \u2018a tribunal favorable\u2019 to it.\u201d Travis v. \nUnited States, 364 U.S. 631, 634 (1961) (citation omitted). \n\n \n43 \n3. The hardship decisions were not based on a \ndetermination of nationwide scope or effect. \nEPA asserts (U.S. Br. 33-35) that its individual denial \ndecisions were based on two determinations of nationwide \nscope or effect: \u201cEPA\u2019s revised interpretation of the rele-\nvant CAA provisions and the RIN discount and RIN cost \npassthrough principles.\u201d Pet.App.187a-188a. That mis-\ncharacterizes both the statutory text and the final actions. \na. As an initial matter, neither EPA\u2019s statutory inter-\npretation nor its economic hypothesis was a statutory  \n\u201cdetermination\u201d as the CAA uses that term of art. See pp. \n32-34, supra. Neither describes any issue that the CAA\u2019s \ntext directed EPA to \u201cdetermine\u201d before acting on a small  \nrefinery\u2019s RFS hardship petition. See \u00a7 7545(o)(9).  \nIn the immediately preceding subsection, Congress  \ninstructed EPA to extend two-year hardship exemptions \nbased on DOE\u2019s \u201cdetermin[ation]\u201d about a small refin-\nery\u2019s hardship. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(A)(ii)(II). And elsewhere in \nthe same Section, Congress authorized EPA to grant cer-\ntain waivers, following consultation with DOE, \u201cbased on \na determination by the Administrator \u2026 that implemen-\ntation of the requirement would severely harm the econ-\nomy or environment of a State, a region, or the United \nStates.\u201d \u00a7 7545(o)(7)(A)(i).  \nCongress thus knows how to make actions \u201cbased on a \ndetermination\u201d when it wants to. It did not do that for \nsmall-refinery hardship petitions in Section 7545(o)(9)(B). \nEPA\u2019s position wrongly depends on treating \u201cdetermina-\ntion\u201d in Section 7607(b)(1) not as a statutory term of art \nbut rather as some amorphous concept of anything that \ncontributed significantly to a final action.  \nb. Even if Section 7607(b)(1) used \u201cdetermination\u201d in \nthe colloquial sense, EPA would still be wrong about the \nbasis for these hardship-petition denial actions. \n\n \n44 \ni. EPA\u2019s first suggestion\u2014that a statutory interpre-\ntation can qualify as a \u201cdetermination of nationwide scope \nor effect\u201d\u2014is nothing less than an argument that every \nEPA action must go to the D.C. Circuit. EPA is a \u201ccrea-\nture[ ] of statute,\u201d so \u201cit possess[es] only the authority that \nCongress has provided.\u201d National Fed\u2019n of Indep. Bus. v. \nDep\u2019t of Lab., Occupational Safety & Health Admin., 595 \nU.S. 109, 117, (2022). Every EPA action is necessarily \n\u201cbased on\u201d the agency\u2019s understanding of its statutory  \nauthority. \nIt similarly cannot be the case (contra U.S. Br. 34) that \nEPA\u2019s denial actions here were based on a nationwide  \ndetermination because EPA applied a statutory interpre-\ntation \u201cuniformly\u201d to them. If EPA had not done that\u2014if \nit had applied a different statutory reading to similarly \nsituated small-refinery petitioners\u2014that would be the \nheight of arbitrariness. So \u201cif application of a national \nstandard \u2026 were the controlling factor, there never could \nbe a local or regional action\u201d because every EPA action \n\u201cpurportedly applies a national standard created by the \nnational statute and its national regulations.\u201d West Vir-\nginia, 90 F.4th at 329-330. This Court should not read the \nnarrow nationwide-scope-or-effect exception to \u201cswallow \nthe\u201d local-or-regionally-applicable rule. Cuomo v. Clear-\ning House Ass\u2019n, L.L.C., 557 U.S. 519, 530 (2009). \nThe most obvious examples of locally applicable  \nactions involve EPA applying a uniform statutory stand-\nard to individual regulated parties\u2019 factual circumstances. \nAccord U.S. Br. 42. Acknowledging that reality, EPA  \nultimately abandons any argument based on application \nof a \u201cuniform\u201d standard, conceding (U.S. Br. 41) that EPA \n\u201cdoes not\u201d make a nationwide-scope determination \u201cwhen \nit merely applies a previously established agency \u2026 inter-\npretation to new \u2018locally or regionally applicable\u2019 circum-\n\n \n45 \nstances.\u201d That describes what EPA did in the final actions \nchallenged here: It applied its statutory interpretation to \neach petitioning small refinery\u2019s evidence about its local \neconomic circumstances. See pp. 34-35, supra. \nInsofar as EPA contends (U.S. Br. 33, 41) that what \nmatters here is that it promulgated its \u201cnew interpreta-\ntion\u201d at \u201croughly the same time\u201d it denied the hardship \npetitions, that argument does not rebut the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \nvenue conclusion. For one thing, that argument would not \nextend to the June 2022 Denial decisions, which merely \napplied the statutory interpretation that EPA had an-\nnounced months earlier in April. Pet.App.80a.11 \nIn any event, EPA\u2019s choice to offer a new statutory \nanalysis cannot alter what determination the statute  \nrequired as the basis for every small-refinery hardship \ndecision. The text does not ask whether the agency made \nsome determination of nationwide scope or effect in con-\nnection with the action. It asks whether EPA \u201cbased\u201d its \nfinal action on such a determination. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). Here, as \nexplained above, the basis for these final actions must by \nlaw be findings about the individual petitioning small  \n \n11  Despite EPA repeatedly referring to the April and June \nDenials as two separate actions, EPA simultaneously argues \nthat those explanation documents should be treated as one for \npurposes of establishing its new adjudication approach to hard-\nship petitions. U.S. Br. 42-43 n.6. EPA urges this Court (ibid.) \nto disregard the \u201ctime that passed between the[ir] finalization\u201d \nbecause \u201c[b]oth denial actions here stemmed from a single \npropos[al].\u201d But obviously one proposal can lead ultimately to \nmultiple final actions. And according to the face of the June  \nexplanation document, it was only the April explanation docu-\nment that broke new ground: \u201cIn this action, EPA is applying \nthe approach proposed on December 7, 2021, and adopted in \nthe April 2022 [RFS] Denial.\u201d Pet.App.80a (emphases added). \n\n \n46 \nrefineries\u2019 economic circumstances. And EPA has admit-\nted that these hardship decisions were based on just that. \nSee p. 34, supra. \nMoreover, EPA\u2019s new statutory interpretation was \nnot sufficient to produce final agency action in this con-\ntext. Recall that EPA could not, and did not, use a rule-\nmaking for its new interpretation\u2014because to do so here \nwould plainly have been illegally retroactive. If EPA had \nwanted judicial review to focus on its new statutory inter-\npretation (U.S. Br. 42), it could have run a (lawful) rule-\nmaking process. But EPA expressly chose to proceed only \nby adjudication. See Pet.App.188 (\u201cThis action is not a \nrulemaking\u201d). That choice meant that EPA could produce \n\u201cfinal action \u2026 under this chapter\u201d not by analyzing the \nstatute but rather only by evaluating the petitioning small \nrefineries\u2019 economic evidence. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). \nIt is also no answer for EPA to contend (U.S. Br. 35, \n42) that a case must go to the D.C. Circuit when \u201ccircum-\nstances suggest\u201d that EPA\u2019s statutory interpretation is \n\u201clikely to be called into question\u201d in the litigation. That \nflies in the face of the courts\u2019 consistent holding (and \nEPA\u2019s consistent position) that what matters is EPA\u2019s  \n\u201cfinal action,\u201d not the petitioner\u2019s arguments challenging \nit. See pp. 7-8, supra. It will not always be apparent at the \noutset of litigation, when venue is typically (and most effi-\nciently) resolved, what aspects of an EPA action will be \ncalled into question. \nThe better answer is the simpler one that also gives \nthe statutory terms their ordinary meaning: An EPA  \naction is based on a determination of nationwide scope or \neffect in the rare instance when the CAA\u2019s text directs \nEPA to make a factual \u201cdetermination\u201d about the entire \nnation or industry, without the need to consider individual \ncircumstances. \n\n \n47 \nii. For many of the same reasons, EPA\u2019s RIN-cost-\npassthrough hypothesis did not make these hardship  \ndenial actions based on a determination of nationwide \nscope or effect. Even if EPA\u2019s passthrough hypothesis \ncould qualify as a \u201cdetermination\u201d under the statute when \nthe text does not describe it that way, see pp. 33-34, supra, \nthe actions denying the hardship petitions were not \n\u201cbased on\u201d it, \u00a7 7607(b)(1). EPA had merely a hypothe-\nsis\u2014an \u201canalysis of how\u201d EPA \u201cexpected\u201d individual fuels \nmarkets to respond, Pet.App.163a-165a\u2014that EPA \nneeded to test, and did test, against each hardship peti-\ntion\u2019s evidence. See pp. 34-35, supra. Only that analysis of \neach refinery\u2019s individual evidence could be the \u201cbas[is]\u201d \nfor \u201cfinal action[s]\u201d denying respondents\u2019 hardship peti-\ntions. \u00a7 7607(b)(1) (emphasis added). \nEPA\u2019s actions were not \u201cbased on\u201d any supposedly  \nnationwide RIN-cost-passthrough determination for the \nadditional reason that, with or without any nationwide  \nassessment, EPA\u2019s denial actions here would have been \nexactly the same. The government agrees (U.S. Br. 41) \nthat the textual \u201ccausation requirement\u201d in Section \n7607(b)(1) means that \u201cthe relevant determinations\u201d must \nbe \u201cat the core of EPA\u2019s action.\u201d But here, EPA did not \nneed any nationwide finding about any other refineries to \nconclude, as it wrongly did in the denial actions, that each \nof the small-refinery respondents were \u201cable to pass along \nRFS compliance costs,\u201d were \u201crecovering [their] costs,\u201d \nand so were suffering \u201cno economic harm.\u201d Pet.App.99a-\n100a, 165a; JA 280.  \nIn short, the conclusion that drove each denial decision \nwas not that all obligated parties recover their RFS costs; \nit was that each of these respondents (purportedly) does. \nAs EPA itself explains (U.S. Br. 10): It denied respond-\nents\u2019 hardship petitions because it \u201cdetermined that none \n\n \n48 \nof the petitioning small refineries had rebutted [the RIN-\ncost-passthrough] presumption through evidence about \ntheir specific circumstances.\u201d Those were conclusions \nabout specific refineries, not nationwide determinations.12 \nc. EPA invokes the history (U.S. Br. 35-38) of the \nthird-sentence exception in Section 7607(b)(1), but that \nhistory actually undermines EPA\u2019s position. As recounted \nabove, the exception was prompted by General Counsel \nFrick\u2019s description of an atypical CAA provision that, \nthough calling for a local action (an extension for specific \nStates), textually required EPA\u2019s action to be based on a \ndetermination about technology available throughout the \nindustry. See pp. 8-9, supra. That extension action did not \nrequire or even contemplate any consideration of individ-\nualized State circumstances; EPA was tasked instead \nwith making a finding about the technology available \nthroughout the nation. \nEPA\u2019s actions on small-refinery hardship petitions \nlook nothing like that. The text of Section 7545(o)(9)(B), \nunlike the unusual provision that Frick described, does \nnot ask EPA to make any \u201cdetermination\u201d about the  \nentire nation or industry as a basis for granting hardship \nrelief. It does not call for any determination at all. To the \nextent it does, it calls for a determination about the indi-\nvidual petitioning small refinery\u2019s economic circum-\nstances. See pp. 33-34, supra. \nEPA responds by catastrophizing (U.S. Br. 38) that if \nthe denials here do not qualify as based on nationwide  \n \n12  EPA\u2019s footnoted discussion (U.S. Br. 34 n.5) of how it \nchooses to respond to granted hardship petitions is irrelevant \nto Section 7607(b)(1), because those downstream choices by the \nagency say nothing about what was the \u201cbas[is]\u201d for the final \ndenial actions here. \n\n \n49 \ndeterminations, then the third-sentence exception to Sec-\ntion 7607(b)(1) will be \u201cpractically insignificant.\u201d But the \nthird sentence was always meant to state an exception to \nthe general rule for locally applicable actions. General \nCounsel Frick urged the exception\u2019s adoption to address \na CAA provision that has since been repealed. That is \nlikely why, before the cases involving EPA\u2019s denial deci-\nsions here, no court had ever found a locally applicable \nEPA action that was based on a determination of nation-\nwide scope or effect. The exception is properly narrow. \nd. EPA concludes by resorting to a policy argument: \nIt asks this Court to read \u201cbased on a determination of  \nnationwide scope or effect\u201d broadly, on the theory that  \njudicial review will be more efficient if the D.C. Circuit \nalone considers issues like EPA\u2019s statutory analysis and \nmethodological framework.  \nAppeals to policy cannot supersede the ordinary \nmeaning of the terms in Section 7607(b)(1) or the confir-\nmation of their meaning in the statutory context and his-\ntory. Niz-Chavez v. Garland, 593 U.S. 155, 171 (2021) (\u201cno \namount of policy-talk can overcome a plain statutory com-\nmand\u201d). And in any event, EPA\u2019s policy argument falls \nflat. If EPA wants to propound a new statutory interpre-\ntation and have it reviewed by only the D.C. Circuit, then \nthe agency need only adopt that interpretation through a \nlawful rulemaking process. \nExperience has proven EPA wrong in suggesting that \nconsolidated D.C. Circuit review of CAA actions is always \nor usually best. The litigation here is a perfect example. \nBecause EPA persuaded several regional circuit courts to \ntransfer small refineries\u2019 challenges to their hardship- \ndenial decisions, the D.C. Circuit ended up hearing one \nmassive case consolidating dozens of small refineries\u2019  \npetitions for review. See p. 18, supra. That consolidation \n\n \n50 \nmade the D.C. Circuit litigation take much longer than \nother small refineries\u2019 regional-circuit challenges to \nEPA\u2019s denials of their hardship petitions.  \nEven more important, consolidation in the D.C. Cir-\ncuit made it very difficult for the individual small refiner-\nies to get judicial attention on what ultimately matters \nmost: their specific economic circumstances that give rise \nto their disproportionate economic hardship from the \nRFS. To take just one example: In the mass D.C. Circuit \nchallenge alongside dozens of co-petitioners, there was no \neasy way for a small refinery affiliated with one respond-\nent here, Calumet Montana, to ask the court to focus on \nthe idiosyncrasies of producing blended diesel fuel in a \ncold climate in winter. Yet that is exactly the sort of con-\ndition that causes Calumet Montana to face dispropor-\ntionate economic hardship from the RFS. \nEPA\u2019s preference for near-universal D.C. Circuit  \nreview would obscure the judiciary\u2019s consideration of  \nindividual regulated entities\u2019 circumstances, contrary to \nthe essential logic of Congress\u2019s plan for a national vs.  \nlocal divide in Section 7607(b)(1). \n\n \n51 \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be af-\nfirmed. \nRespectfully submitted, \nLeAnn M.

An adjustment in the 50 or 60 percent \ngreenhouse gas levels shall be the minimum possible \nadjustment for the fuel or fuels concerned, and the ad-\njusted greenhouse gas reduction shall be established \nat the maximum achievable level, taking cost in con-\nsideration, allowing for the use of a variety of feed-\nstocks, technologies, and processes. \n(D) 5-year review \nWhenever the Administrator makes any adjustment \nunder this paragraph, not later than 5 years thereafter \nhe shall review and revise (based upon the same crite-\nria and standards as required for the initial adjust-\nment) the regulations establishing the adjusted level. \n(E) Subsequent adjustments \nAfter the Administrator has promulgated a final rule \nunder the last sentence of paragraph (2)(A)(i) with re-\nspect to the method of determining lifecycle green-\nhouse gas emissions, except as provided in subpara-\ngraph (D), the Administrator may not adjust the per-\ncent greenhouse gas reduction levels unless he deter-\nmines that there has been a significant change in the \nanalytical methodology used for determining the \nlifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. If he makes such \ndetermination, he may adjust the 20, 50, or 60 percent \nreduction levels through rulemaking using the criteria \nand standards set forth in this paragraph. \n(F) Limit on upward adjustments \nIf, under subparagraph (D) or (E), the Administrator \nrevises a percent level adjusted as provided in subpar-\nagraphs (A), (B), and (C) to a higher percent, such \nhigher percent may not exceed the applicable percent \n\n15a \n \nspecified in paragraph (2)(A)(i), (1)(D), (1)(B)(i), or \n(1)(E). \n(G) Applicability of adjustments \nIf the Administrator adjusts, or revises, a percent \nlevel referred to in this paragraph or makes a change \nin the analytical methodology used for determining \nthe lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions, such adjust-\nment, revision, or change (or any combination thereof) \nshall only apply to renewable fuel from new facilities \nthat commence construction after the effective date of \nsuch adjustment, revision, or change. \n(5) Credit program \n(A) In general \nThe regulations promulgated under paragraph (2)(A) \nshall provide\u2014 \n(i) for the generation of an appropriate amount of \ncredits by any person that refines, blends, or imports \ngasoline that contains a quantity of renewable fuel \nthat is greater than the quantity required under para-\ngraph (2); \n(ii) for the generation of an appropriate amount of \ncredits for biodiesel; and  \n(iii) for the generation of credits by small refiner-\nies in accordance with paragraph (9)(C). \n(B) Use of credits \nA person that generates credits under subparagraph \n(A) may use the credits, or transfer all or a portion of \nthe credits to another person, for the purpose of com-\nplying with paragraph (2). \n\n16a \n \n(C) Duration of credits \nA credit generated under this paragraph shall be valid \nto show compliance for the 12 months as of the date of \ngeneration. \n(D) Inability to generate or purchase sufficient \ncredits \nThe regulations promulgated under paragraph (2)(A) \nshall include provisions allowing any person that is un-\nable to generate or purchase sufficient credits to meet \nthe requirements of paragraph (2) to carry forward a \nrenewable fuel deficit on condition that the person, in \nthe calendar year following the year in which the re-\nnewable fuel deficit is created\u2014 \n(i) achieves compliance with the renewable fuel re-\nquirement under paragraph (2); and \n(ii) generates or purchases additional renewable \nfuel credits to offset the renewable fuel deficit of the \nprevious year. \n(E) Credits for additional renewable fuel \nThe Administrator may issue regulations providing: \n(i) for the generation of an appropriate amount of cred-\nits by any person that refines, blends, or imports addi-\ntional renewable fuels specified by the Administrator;

These regulations \nshall include such provisions, including limiting the \ncredits\u2019 uses and useful life, as the Administrator \ndeems appropriate to assist market liquidity and \ntransparency, to provide appropriate certainty for \nregulated entities and renewable fuel producers, and \nto limit any potential misuse of cellulosic biofuel cred-\nits to reduce the use of other renewable fuels, and for \nsuch other purposes as the Administrator determines \nwill help achieve the goals of this subsection. The reg-\nulations shall limit the number of cellulosic biofuel \ncredits for any calendar year to the minimum applica-\nble volume (as reduced under this subparagraph) of \ncellulosic biofuel for that year. \n(E) Biomass-based diesel \n(i)  Market evaluation \nThe Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary \nof Energy and the Secretary of Agriculture, shall pe-\nriodically evaluate the impact of the biomass-based \ndiesel requirements established under this paragraph \non the price of diesel fuel. \n(ii)  Waiver \nIf the Administrator determines that there is a signif-\nicant renewable feedstock disruption or other market \ncircumstances that would make the price of biomass-\nbased diesel fuel increase significantly, the Admin- \n\n21a \n \nistrator, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy \nand the Secretary of Agriculture, shall issue an order \nto reduce, for up to a 60-day period, the quantity of bi-\nomass-based diesel required under subparagraph (A) \nby an appropriate quantity that does not exceed 15 \npercent of the applicable annual requirement for bio-\nmass-based diesel. For any calendar year in which the \nAdministrator makes a reduction under this subpara-\ngraph, the Administrator may also reduce the applica-\nble volume of renewable fuel and advanced biofuels re-\nquirement established under paragraph (2)(B) by the \nsame or a lesser volume. \n(iii) Extensions \nIf the Administrator determines that the feedstock \ndisruption or circumstances described in clause (ii) is \ncontinuing beyond the 60-day period described in \nclause (ii) or this clause, the Administrator, in consul-\ntation with the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary \nof Agriculture, may issue an order to reduce, for up to \nan additional 60-day period, the quantity of biomass-\nbased diesel required under subparagraph (A) by an \nappropriate quantity that does not exceed an addi-\ntional 15 percent of the applicable annual requirement \nfor biomass-based diesel. \n(F) Modification of applicable volumes \nFor any of the tables in paragraph (2)(B), if the Ad-\nministrator waives\u2014 \n(i) at least 20 percent of the applicable volume re-\nquirement set forth in any such table for 2 consecutive \nyears; or \n(ii) at least 50 percent of such volume requirement \nfor a single year, the Administrator shall promulgate \na rule (within 1 year after issuing such waiver) that \nmodifies the applicable volumes set forth in the table \n\n22a \n \nconcerned for all years following the final year to \nwhich the waiver applies, except that no such modifi-\ncation in applicable volumes shall be made for any year \nbefore 2016. In promulgating such a rule, the Admin-\nistrator shall comply with the processes, criteria, and \nstandards set forth in paragraph (2)(B)(ii). \n(8) Study and waiver for initial year of program \n(A) In general \nNot later than 180 days after August 8, 2005, the Sec-\nretary of Energy shall conduct for the Administrator \na study assessing whether the renewable fuel require-\nment under paragraph (2) will likely result in signifi-\ncant adverse impacts on consumers in 2006, on a na-\ntional, regional, or State basis. \n(B) Required evaluations \nThe study shall evaluate renewable fuel\u2014 \n(i) supplies and prices; \n(ii) blendstock supplies; and  \n(iii) supply and distribution system capabilities. \n(C) Recommendations by the Secretary \nBased on the results of the study, the Secretary of En-\nergy shall make specific recommendations to the Ad-\nministrator concerning waiver of the requirements of \nparagraph (2), in whole or in part, to prevent any ad-\nverse impacts described in subparagraph (A). \n(D) Waiver \n(i)  In general \nNot later than 270 days after August 8, 2005, the Ad-\nministrator shall, if and to the extent recommended by \nthe Secretary of Energy under subparagraph (C), \nwaive, in whole or in part, the renewable fuel require-\nment under paragraph (2) by reducing the national \n\n23a \n \nquantity of renewable fuel required under paragraph \n(2) in calendar year 2006. \n(ii)  No effect on waiver authority \nClause (i) does not limit the authority of the Adminis-\ntrator to waive the requirements of paragraph (2) in \nwhole, or in part, under paragraph (7). \n(9)  Small refineries \n(A) Temporary exemption \n(i) In general \nThe requirements of paragraph (2) shall not apply to \nsmall refineries until calendar year 2011. \n(ii)  Extension of exemption \n(I) Study by Secretary of Energy \nNot later than December 31, 2008, the Secretary of \nEnergy shall conduct for the Administrator a study to de-\ntermine whether compliance with the requirements of \nparagraph (2) would impose a disproportionate economic \nhardship on small refineries. \n(II) Extension of exemption \nIn the case of a small refinery that the Secretary \nof Energy determines under subclause (I) would be sub-\nject to a disproportionate economic hardship if required \nto comply with paragraph (2), the Administrator shall ex-\ntend the exemption under clause (i) for the small refinery \nfor a period of not less than 2 additional years. \n(B) Petitions based on disproportionate eco-\nnomic hardship \n(i) Extension of exemption \nA small refinery may at any time petition the Admin-\nistrator for an extension of the exemption under \n\n24a \n \nsubparagraph (A) for the reason of disproportionate \neconomic hardship. \n(ii) Evaluation of petitions \nIn evaluating a petition under clause (i), the Adminis-\ntrator, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, \nshall consider the findings of the study under subpar-\nagraph (A)(ii) and other economic factors. \n(iii) Deadline for action on petitions \nThe Administrator shall act on any petition submitted \nby a small refinery for a hardship exemption not later \nthan 90 days after the date of receipt of the petition. \n(C) Credit program \nIf a small refinery notifies the Administrator that the \nsmall refinery waives the exemption under subpara-\ngraph (A), the regulations promulgated under para-\ngraph (2)(A) shall provide for the generation of credits \nby the small refinery under paragraph (5) beginning \nin the calendar year following the date of notification. \n(D) Opt-in for small refineries \nA small refinery shall be subject to the requirements \nof paragraph (2) if the small refinery notifies the Ad-\nministrator that the small refinery waives the exemp-\ntion under subparagraph (A). \n(10)  Ethanol market concentration analysis \n(A) Analysis \n(i) In general \nNot later than 180 days after August 8, 2005, and an-\nnually thereafter, the Federal Trade Commission \nshall perform a market concentration analysis of the \nethanol production industry using the Herfindahl-\nHirschman Index to determine whether there is \n\n25a \n \nsufficient competition among industry participants to \navoid price-setting and other anticompetitive behav-\nior. \n(ii) Scoring \nFor the purpose of scoring under clause (i) using the \nHerfindahl-Hirschman Index, all marketing arrange-\nments among industry participants shall be consid-\nered. \n(B) Report \nNot later than December 1, 2005, and annually there-\nafter, the Federal Trade Commission shall submit to \nCongress and the Administrator a report on the re-\nsults of the market concentration analysis performed \nunder subparagraph (A)(i). \n(11) Periodic reviews \nTo allow for the appropriate adjustment of the re-\nquirements described in subparagraph (B) of para-\ngraph (2), the Administrator shall conduct periodic re-\nviews of\u2014 \n(A) existing technologies;

Six of those refineries petitioned \nfor review of EPA\u2019s decisions in the Fifth Circuit, which \ndenied the government\u2019s motion to transfer the peti-\ntions to the D.C. Circuit.  The question presented is as \nfollows: \nWhether venue for the refineries\u2019 challenges lies ex-\nclusively in the D.C. Circuit because the denial actions \nare \u201cnationally applicable\u201d or, alternatively, are \u201cbased \non a determination of nationwide scope or effect.\u201d  42 \nU.S.C. 7607(b)(1). \n \n \n\n(III) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage\nOpinion below ................................................................................ 1 \nJurisdiction .................................................................................... 1 \nStatutory provisions involved ...................................................... 1 \nStatement: \nA. \nLegal background ............................................................ 2 \nB. \nFacts and proceedings below ......................................... 6 \nSummary of argument ............................................................... 14 \nArgument: \nThe D.C.

Petitions for rehearing were de-\nnied on January 22, 2024 (Pet. App. 331a-333a).  On April \n11, 2024, Justice Alito extended the time within which \nto file a petition for a writ of certiorari to and including \nMay 21, 2024.  The petition for a writ of certiorari was \nfiled on May 20, 2024, and was granted on October 21, \n2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court rests on 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent statutory provisions are reprinted in the \nappendix.  App., infra, 1a-32a. \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal Background \n1. When a petitioner seeks review of a \u201cfinal action\u201d \ntaken by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \nunder the Clean Air Act (CAA), 42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq., \nSection 7607(b)(1) of Title 42 provides for direct court \nof appeals review of the petitioner\u2019s challenge.  To de-\ntermine which circuit has exclusive venue over the chal-\nlenge, Section 7607(b)(1) separates EPA\u2019s final actions \ninto three categories.  First, challenges to certain spec-\nified actions or to \u201cany other nationally applicable reg-\nulations promulgated, or final action taken,\u201d must be \nfiled \u201conly in the United States Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  Second, \nchallenges to actions that are \u201clocally or regionally ap-\nplicable may be filed only in the United States Court of \nAppeals for the appropriate circuit.\u201d  Ibid.  Third, \n\u201c[n]otwithstanding\u201d the sentence directing review of lo-\ncally or regionally applicable actions to \u201cthe appropri-\nate circuit,\u201d challenges to such locally or regionally ap-\nplicable actions \u201cmay be filed only in the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia if such ac-\ntion is based on a determination of nationwide scope or \neffect and if in taking such action the Administrator \nfinds and publishes that such action is based on such a \ndetermination.\u201d  Ibid.   \nCongress adopted this three-prong structure in \n1977.  See Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977, Pub. L. \nNo. 95, 91 Stat. 776.  The predecessor to Section \n7607(b)(1) had provided for direct court of appeals re-\nview only of certain specifically enumerated EPA ac-\ntions.  42 U.S.C. 1857h-5(b)(1) (1970).  EPA actions in-\nvolving \u201cnational primary or secondary ambient air \nquality standard[s],\u201d \u201cemission standard[s],\u201d or other \n\n3 \n \nspecified standards or controls were reviewable only in \nthe D.C. Circuit, while EPA\u2019s actions \u201cin approving or \npromulgating\u201d a state or federal \u201cimplementation plan\u201d \nwere reviewable only in \u201cthe appropriate circuit.\u201d  Ibid.  \nThat division reflected Congress\u2019s view that EPA ac-\ntions that are \u201cnational in scope\u201d should receive \u201ceven \nand consistent national application,\u201d which would be ac-\ncomplished through centralized D.C. Circuit review.   \nS. Rep. No. 1196, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 41 (1970) (1970 \nSenate Report).  By contrast, Congress viewed EPA ac-\ntions approving or promulgating \u201cimplementation plans \nwhich run only to one air quality control region\u201d as ap-\npropriately reviewed \u201cin the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Circuit in which the affected air quality control re-\ngion, or portion thereof, is located.\u201d  Ibid.  At that time, \nthe venue provision did not include a catchall for other \nnationally or locally or regionally applicable actions, nor \ndid the provision specifically reference EPA actions \nthat are based on a determination of nationwide scope \nor effect.  Rather, final actions that the CAA venue pro-\nvision did not specifically address were reviewable only \nby a district court exercising federal-question jurisdic-\ntion.  See Harrison v. PPG Industries, Inc., 446 U.S. \n578, 584 (1980).   \nIn 1977, Congress amended the statute to authorize \ndirect court of appeals review of all EPA \u201cfinal actions\u201d \nunder the CAA.  Congress achieved that result by add-\ning the catchall categories for the first two subsets of \nfinal actions, and by adding the third category of locally \nor regionally applicable actions that are based on a de-\ntermination of nationwide scope or effect.  The House \nReport accompanying the amendment explained that \nthe revision would \u201cprovide[] for essentially locally, \nstatewide, or regionally applicable rules or orders to be \n\n4 \n \nreviewed in the U.S. court of appeals for the circuit in \nwhich such locality, State, or region is located.\u201d  H.R. \nRep. No. 294, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 323 (1977) (1977 \nHouse Report).  \u201cOn the other hand,\u201d the report ex-\nplained, venue would lie only in the D.C. Circuit \u201cif an \naction of the Administrator is found by him to be based \non a determination of nationwide scope or effect (includ-\ning a determination which has scope or effect beyond a \nsingle judicial circuit).\u201d  Id. at 324.   \n2. The EPA actions at issue in this case involve the \nRenewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program, a CAA pro-\ngram that generally requires transportation fuel sold or \nintroduced into commerce in the United States to con-\ntain specified volumes of renewable fuel.  See 42 U.S.C. \n7545(o)(2)(A)(i) and (B)(i).  To implement the program, \nEPA expresses renewable-fuel targets as a percentage \nof the gasoline and diesel fuel that is projected to be sold \nin the upcoming year, and the agency adopts regulations \nto ensure compliance.  See 42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(2)(A)(i); see \nalso 42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(3).  Obligated parties \u201cuse that \nannual-percentage standard to determine their volume \nobligations\u201d for the year.  Pet. App. 3a.  Each obligated \nparty\u2019s renewable-fuel-volume obligation is propor-\ntional to its annual production or importation of gaso-\nline and diesel fuel.   \nEPA\u2019s implementing regulations identify refineries \nand importers of gasoline and diesel as obligated parties \nsubject to RFS requirements.  40 C.F.R. 80.2, 80.1406.  \nTo track whether an obligated party has satisfied RFS \nprogram requirements, EPA uses a credit system that \noffers parties flexibility in achieving compliance.  See 42 \nU.S.C. 7545(o)(5).  Producers and importers of renewa-\nble fuels generate credits\u2014called Renewable Identifi-\ncation Numbers (RINs)\u2014for each gallon of renewable \n\n5 \n \nfuel they produce or import for use in the United States.  \n40 C.F.R. 80.1426(a).  The producers and importers as-\nsign a RIN to each batch of renewable fuel.  40 C.F.R. \n80.1426(e).  A RIN may be used after it is \u201cseparated\u201d \nfrom its batch by an obligated party or by an entity that \nblends the renewable fuel into gasoline or diesel.  40 \nC.F.R. 80.1429(b).  Once separated, RINs may be kept \nfor compliance or sold.  40 C.F.R. 80.1425-80.1429.  Each \nyear, a refinery may generate its own credits by blend-\ning renewable fuel into transportation fuel, or it may \npurchase the requisite number of credits.  See Pet. App. \n206a-207a; see also 42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(5)(B) and (E); 40 \nC.F.R. 80.1428(b), 80.1429(b). \nObligated parties meet their renewable-fuel-volume \nobligations by \u201cretir[ing]\u201d RINs in an annual compli-\nance demonstration.  40 C.F.R. 80.1427(a)(1).  A refin-\nery may use a particular RIN only during the calendar \nyear in which it was generated or in the following calen-\ndar year.  40 C.F.R. 80.1427(a)(6), 80.1428(c).  An obli-\ngated party who fails to demonstrate full compliance in \none year may carry forward a compliance deficit to the \nfollowing year.  42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(5)(D).  \nCongress created a three-tiered scheme through \nwhich obligated parties that qualify as \u201c[s]mall refiner-\nies\u201d may obtain exemptions from RFS program require-\nments.  42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9) (emphasis omitted); see 42 \nU.S.C. 7545(o)(1)(k) (defining \u201csmall refinery\u201d).   \nFirst, Congress granted all small refineries a blan-\nket exemption until 2011.  42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(A)(i). \nSecond, Congress directed the U.S. Department of \nEnergy (DOE) to study \u201cwhether compliance with the \nrequirements of [the RFS program] would impose a dis-\nproportionate economic hardship on small refineries.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(A)(ii)(I).  For any small refinery \n\n6 \n \nthat DOE determined \u201cwould be subject to a dispropor-\ntionate economic hardship if required to comply,\u201d Con-\ngress directed EPA to extend the exemption for at least \ntwo years.  42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(A)(ii)(II). \nThird, Congress established a mechanism through \nwhich a small refinery \u201cmay at any time petition [EPA] \nfor an extension of the exemption under subparagraph \n(A) for the reason of disproportionate economic hard-\nship.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(B)(i).  In evaluating a peti-\ntion for such an exemption, EPA, \u201cin consultation with\u201d \nDOE, \u201cshall consider the findings of [DOE\u2019s study] and \nother economic factors.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(B)(ii). \nB. Facts And Proceedings Below \n1. In August 2019, EPA issued a single decision act-\ning on 36 exemption petitions filed by small refineries \nfor the 2018 compliance year, granting 31 petitions and \ndenying five.  See C.A. App. 2928.  Multiple parties pe-\ntitioned for review of the action in the D.C. Circuit.  See \nSinclair Wyoming Ref. Co. v. EPA, No. 19-1196; Big \nWest Oil, LLC v. EPA, No. 19-1197; Renewable Fuels \nAss\u2019n v. EPA, No. 19-1220; Kern Oil & Ref. Co. v. EPA, \nNo. 19-1216; Wynnewood Ref. Co. v. EPA, No. 20-1099.   \nWhile those challenges were pending, the Tenth Cir-\ncuit issued a decision vacating and remanding three \nEPA orders granting three exemption petitions for the \n2016 and 2017 compliance years.  Renewable Fuels Ass\u2019n \nv. EPA, 948 F.3d 1206, 1258 (2020).  The court held that \na small refinery is eligible for an extension of an exemp-\ntion only if it has maintained a continuous, uninter-\nrupted exemption, id. at 1245-1249; that \u201crenewable \nfuels compliance must be the cause of any dispropor-\ntionate hardship\u201d in order for an exemption to be avail-\nable, id. at 1253; and that EPA had \u201c\u200a\u2018failed to consider \nan important aspect of the problem\u2019\u200a\u201d when it did not ad-\n\n7 \n \ndress whether refiners could \u201cpass RIN costs on to cus-\ntomers,\u201d id. at 1257 (citation omitted).  This Court \ngranted a petition for a writ of certiorari limited to the \nfirst of those Tenth Circuit holdings.  HollyFrontier \nCheyenne Ref., LLC v. Renewable Fuels Ass\u2019n, 141  \nS. Ct. 974 (2021).  Pending this Court\u2019s resolution of \nHollyFrontier, the D.C. Circuit granted EPA\u2019s motion \nto hold in abeyance the petitions for review that had \nbeen filed in that court. See Sinclair Wyoming Ref. Co. \nv. EPA, No. 19-1196, Doc. 1883334 (Feb. 2, 2021); p. 6, \nsupra.   \nThis Court reversed the Tenth Circuit decision in \nHollyFrontier, holding that a small refinery may be el-\nigible for an exemption renewal even if the refinery had \nallowed a prior exemption to lapse.  HollyFrontier \nCheyenne Ref., LLC v. Renewable Fuels Ass\u2019n, 594 U.S. \n382, 390 (2021).  In the pending D.C. Circuit proceed-\nings, EPA then moved for a voluntary remand without \nvacatur to allow the agency to reconsider its action on \nthe 2018 exemption petitions in light of this Court\u2019s de-\ncision in HollyFrontier, and in light of the Tenth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s analysis in Renewable Fuels Association of addi-\ntional issues this Court had not reached.  See Sinclair \nWyoming Ref. Co., No. 19-1196, Doc. 1911606 (Aug. 25, \n2021).  The D.C. Circuit granted that motion and in-\nstructed EPA to act on the petitions within 120 days.  \nSinclair Wyoming Ref. Co., No. 19-1196, Doc. 1925942 \n(Dec. 8, 2021).   \n2. In December 2021, EPA proposed to deny all \npending small refinery exemption petitions.  86 Fed. \nReg. 70,999 (Dec. 14, 2021); see C.A. App. 520-585.  \nSeeking to create a nationally uniform program, EPA \nproposed to adopt the Tenth Circuit\u2019s reasoning in Re-\nnewable Fuels Association on the issues this Court had \n\n8 \n \nnot considered.  Under that approach, EPA proposed to \ninterpret the pertinent statutory provisions as requir-\ning small refineries seeking exemptions to show that \nRFS compliance itself caused a disproportionate eco-\nnomic hardship.  C.A. App. 545-548.  In accordance with \nthe Tenth Circuit\u2019s analysis, EPA also analyzed whether \nrefineries were able to pass on the costs of RFS compli-\nance to consumers.  The agency concluded that the evi-\ndence supported a rebuttable presumption that such \ncosts \u201care fully passed through to consumers,\u201d so that \nsmall refineries ordinarily would not suffer dispropor-\ntionate economic hardship as a result of RFS compli-\nance.  Id. at 549; see id. at 548-584.  In light of those \nconclusions, EPA proposed to deny all the pending ex-\nemption petitions and sought comment on that pro-\nposed decision.   \nAfter the comment period ended, EPA took two ac-\ntions.  In April 2022\u2014the deadline set by the D.C. Cir-\ncuit to resolve the remanded petitions\u2014EPA denied 36 \nexemption petitions filed by small refineries for the \n2018 compliance year.  Pet. App. 193a; see April 2022 \nDenial of Petitions for Small Refinery Exemptions \nUnder the Renewable Fuel Standard Program, 87 Fed. \nReg. 24,300 (Apr. 25, 2022) (April Notice).  In June \n2022, EPA denied an additional 69 petitions for the \n2016-2021 compliance years.  Pet. App. 48a; see Notice \nof June 2022 Denial of Petitions for Small Refinery Ex-\nemptions Under the Renewable Fuel Standard Pro-\ngram, 87 Fed. Reg. 34,873, 34,874 (June 8, 2022) (June \nNotice).  The two denial actions reflect the same reason-\ning and are based on two principal rationales, one stat-\nutory and one economic.1  The denial actions contain ex-\n \n1  For ease of reference, this brief cites only the April 2022 denial \nwhen discussing reasoning common to both actions. \n\n9 \n \nplicit agency findings that the actions are nationally ap-\nplicable or, in the alternative, that they are based on de-\nterminations of nationwide scope or effect. \nStatutory interpretation.  In the April and June 2022 \ndenial actions, EPA concluded that an extension of the \nsmall refinery exemption under the relevant provisions \nmay be granted only if disproportionate economic hard-\nship was \u201ccaused by RFS compliance.\u201d  Pet. App. 242a.  \nFor relevant context, the agency turned to paragraph \n(A) of 42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9), which established the initial \nblanket exemption for small refineries and the two-year \nextension based on the DOE study.  See 42 U.S.C. \n7545(o)(9)(A) and (B).  The agency observed that para-\ngraph (A) focuses on \u201cwhether compliance with the re-\nquirements of [the RFS program] would impose a [dis-\nproportionate economic hardship] on small refineries.\u201d  \nPet. App. 243a (quoting 42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(A)(ii)(I)).  \nBecause paragraph (B) provides for an extension of the \nexemption provided by paragraph (A), EPA construed \nparagraph (B)\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Six of those refineries petitioned \nfor review of EPA\u2019s decisions in the Fifth Circuit, which \ndenied the government\u2019s motion to transfer the peti-\ntions to the D.C. Circuit.  The question presented is as \nfollows: \nWhether venue for the refineries\u2019 challenges lies ex-\nclusively in the D.C.

App. 1a-43a) \nis reported at 86 F.4th 1121. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nNovember 22, 2023.  Petitions for rehearing were de-\nnied on January 22, 2024 (Pet. App. 331a-333a).  On April \n11, 2024, Justice Alito extended the time within which \nto file a petition for a writ of certiorari to and including \nMay 21, 2024.  The petition for a writ of certiorari was \nfiled on May 20, 2024, and was granted on October 21, \n2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court rests on 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent statutory provisions are reprinted in the \nappendix.  App., infra, 1a-32a. \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal Background \n1. When a petitioner seeks review of a \u201cfinal action\u201d \ntaken by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \nunder the Clean Air Act (CAA), 42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq., \nSection 7607(b)(1) of Title 42 provides for direct court \nof appeals review of the petitioner\u2019s challenge.  To de-\ntermine which circuit has exclusive venue over the chal-\nlenge, Section 7607(b)(1) separates EPA\u2019s final actions \ninto three categories.  First, challenges to certain spec-\nified actions or to \u201cany other nationally applicable reg-\nulations promulgated, or final action taken,\u201d must be \nfiled \u201conly in the United States Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  Second, \nchallenges to actions that are \u201clocally or regionally ap-\nplicable may be filed only in the United States Court of \nAppeals for the appropriate circuit.\u201d  Ibid.  Third, \n\u201c[n]otwithstanding\u201d the sentence directing review of lo-\ncally or regionally applicable actions to \u201cthe appropri-\nate circuit,\u201d challenges to such locally or regionally ap-\nplicable actions \u201cmay be filed only in the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia if such ac-\ntion is based on a determination of nationwide scope or \neffect and if in taking such action the Administrator \nfinds and publishes that such action is based on such a \ndetermination.\u201d  Ibid.   \nCongress adopted this three-prong structure in \n1977.  See Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977, Pub. L. \nNo. 95, 91 Stat. 776.  The predecessor to Section \n7607(b)(1) had provided for direct court of appeals re-\nview only of certain specifically enumerated EPA ac-\ntions.  42 U.S.C. 1857h-5(b)(1) (1970).  EPA actions in-\nvolving \u201cnational primary or secondary ambient air \nquality standard[s],\u201d \u201cemission standard[s],\u201d or other \n\n3 \n \nspecified standards or controls were reviewable only in \nthe D.C. Circuit, while EPA\u2019s actions \u201cin approving or \npromulgating\u201d a state or federal \u201cimplementation plan\u201d \nwere reviewable only in \u201cthe appropriate circuit.\u201d  Ibid.  \nThat division reflected Congress\u2019s view that EPA ac-\ntions that are \u201cnational in scope\u201d should receive \u201ceven \nand consistent national application,\u201d which would be ac-\ncomplished through centralized D.C. Circuit review.   \nS. Rep. No. 1196, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 41 (1970) (1970 \nSenate Report).  By contrast, Congress viewed EPA ac-\ntions approving or promulgating \u201cimplementation plans \nwhich run only to one air quality control region\u201d as ap-\npropriately reviewed \u201cin the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Circuit in which the affected air quality control re-\ngion, or portion thereof, is located.\u201d  Ibid.  At that time, \nthe venue provision did not include a catchall for other \nnationally or locally or regionally applicable actions, nor \ndid the provision specifically reference EPA actions \nthat are based on a determination of nationwide scope \nor effect.  Rather, final actions that the CAA venue pro-\nvision did not specifically address were reviewable only \nby a district court exercising federal-question jurisdic-\ntion.  See Harrison v. PPG Industries, Inc., 446 U.S. \n578, 584 (1980).   \nIn 1977, Congress amended the statute to authorize \ndirect court of appeals review of all EPA \u201cfinal actions\u201d \nunder the CAA.  Congress achieved that result by add-\ning the catchall categories for the first two subsets of \nfinal actions, and by adding the third category of locally \nor regionally applicable actions that are based on a de-\ntermination of nationwide scope or effect.  The House \nReport accompanying the amendment explained that \nthe revision would \u201cprovide[] for essentially locally, \nstatewide, or regionally applicable rules or orders to be \n\n4 \n \nreviewed in the U.S. court of appeals for the circuit in \nwhich such locality, State, or region is located.\u201d  H.R. \nRep. No. 294, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 323 (1977) (1977 \nHouse Report).  \u201cOn the other hand,\u201d the report ex-\nplained, venue would lie only in the D.C. Circuit \u201cif an \naction of the Administrator is found by him to be based \non a determination of nationwide scope or effect (includ-\ning a determination which has scope or effect beyond a \nsingle judicial circuit).\u201d  Id. at 324.   \n2. The EPA actions at issue in this case involve the \nRenewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program, a CAA pro-\ngram that generally requires transportation fuel sold or \nintroduced into commerce in the United States to con-\ntain specified volumes of renewable fuel.  See 42 U.S.C. \n7545(o)(2)(A)(i) and (B)(i).  To implement the program, \nEPA expresses renewable-fuel targets as a percentage \nof the gasoline and diesel fuel that is projected to be sold \nin the upcoming year, and the agency adopts regulations \nto ensure compliance.  See 42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(2)(A)(i); see \nalso 42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(3).  Obligated parties \u201cuse that \nannual-percentage standard to determine their volume \nobligations\u201d for the year.  Pet. App. 3a.  Each obligated \nparty\u2019s renewable-fuel-volume obligation is propor-\ntional to its annual production or importation of gaso-\nline and diesel fuel.   \nEPA\u2019s implementing regulations identify refineries \nand importers of gasoline and diesel as obligated parties \nsubject to RFS requirements.  40 C.F.R. 80.2, 80.1406.  \nTo track whether an obligated party has satisfied RFS \nprogram requirements, EPA uses a credit system that \noffers parties flexibility in achieving compliance.  See 42 \nU.S.C. 7545(o)(5).  Producers and importers of renewa-\nble fuels generate credits\u2014called Renewable Identifi-\ncation Numbers (RINs)\u2014for each gallon of renewable \n\n5 \n \nfuel they produce or import for use in the United States.  \n40 C.F.R. 80.1426(a).  The producers and importers as-\nsign a RIN to each batch of renewable fuel.  40 C.F.R. \n80.1426(e).  A RIN may be used after it is \u201cseparated\u201d \nfrom its batch by an obligated party or by an entity that \nblends the renewable fuel into gasoline or diesel.  40 \nC.F.R. 80.1429(b).  Once separated, RINs may be kept \nfor compliance or sold.  40 C.F.R. 80.1425-80.1429.  Each \nyear, a refinery may generate its own credits by blend-\ning renewable fuel into transportation fuel, or it may \npurchase the requisite number of credits.  See Pet. App. \n206a-207a; see also 42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(5)(B) and (E); 40 \nC.F.R. 80.1428(b), 80.1429(b). \nObligated parties meet their renewable-fuel-volume \nobligations by \u201cretir[ing]\u201d RINs in an annual compli-\nance demonstration.  40 C.F.R. 80.1427(a)(1).  A refin-\nery may use a particular RIN only during the calendar \nyear in which it was generated or in the following calen-\ndar year.  40 C.F.R. 80.1427(a)(6), 80.1428(c).  An obli-\ngated party who fails to demonstrate full compliance in \none year may carry forward a compliance deficit to the \nfollowing year.  42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(5)(D).  \nCongress created a three-tiered scheme through \nwhich obligated parties that qualify as \u201c[s]mall refiner-\nies\u201d may obtain exemptions from RFS program require-\nments.  42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9) (emphasis omitted); see 42 \nU.S.C. 7545(o)(1)(k) (defining \u201csmall refinery\u201d).   \nFirst, Congress granted all small refineries a blan-\nket exemption until 2011.  42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(A)(i). \nSecond, Congress directed the U.S. Department of \nEnergy (DOE) to study \u201cwhether compliance with the \nrequirements of [the RFS program] would impose a dis-\nproportionate economic hardship on small refineries.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(A)(ii)(I).  For any small refinery \n\n6 \n \nthat DOE determined \u201cwould be subject to a dispropor-\ntionate economic hardship if required to comply,\u201d Con-\ngress directed EPA to extend the exemption for at least \ntwo years.  42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(A)(ii)(II). \nThird, Congress established a mechanism through \nwhich a small refinery \u201cmay at any time petition [EPA] \nfor an extension of the exemption under subparagraph \n(A) for the reason of disproportionate economic hard-\nship.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(B)(i).  In evaluating a peti-\ntion for such an exemption, EPA, \u201cin consultation with\u201d \nDOE, \u201cshall consider the findings of [DOE\u2019s study] and \nother economic factors.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(B)(ii). \nB. Facts And Proceedings Below \n1. In August 2019, EPA issued a single decision act-\ning on 36 exemption petitions filed by small refineries \nfor the 2018 compliance year, granting 31 petitions and \ndenying five.  See C.A. App. 2928.  Multiple parties pe-\ntitioned for review of the action in the D.C. Circuit.  See \nSinclair Wyoming Ref. Co. v. EPA, No. 19-1196; Big \nWest Oil, LLC v. EPA, No. 19-1197; Renewable Fuels \nAss\u2019n v. EPA, No. 19-1220; Kern Oil & Ref. Co. v. EPA, \nNo. 19-1216; Wynnewood Ref. Co. v. EPA, No. 20-1099.   \nWhile those challenges were pending, the Tenth Cir-\ncuit issued a decision vacating and remanding three \nEPA orders granting three exemption petitions for the \n2016 and 2017 compliance years.  Renewable Fuels Ass\u2019n \nv. EPA, 948 F.3d 1206, 1258 (2020).  The court held that \na small refinery is eligible for an extension of an exemp-\ntion only if it has maintained a continuous, uninter-\nrupted exemption, id. at 1245-1249; that \u201crenewable \nfuels compliance must be the cause of any dispropor-\ntionate hardship\u201d in order for an exemption to be avail-\nable, id. at 1253; and that EPA had \u201c\u200a\u2018failed to consider \nan important aspect of the problem\u2019\u200a\u201d when it did not ad-\n\n7 \n \ndress whether refiners could \u201cpass RIN costs on to cus-\ntomers,\u201d id. at 1257 (citation omitted).  This Court \ngranted a petition for a writ of certiorari limited to the \nfirst of those Tenth Circuit holdings.  HollyFrontier \nCheyenne Ref., LLC v. Renewable Fuels Ass\u2019n, 141  \nS. Ct. 974 (2021).  Pending this Court\u2019s resolution of \nHollyFrontier, the D.C. Circuit granted EPA\u2019s motion \nto hold in abeyance the petitions for review that had \nbeen filed in that court. See Sinclair Wyoming Ref. Co. \nv. EPA, No. 19-1196, Doc. 1883334 (Feb. 2, 2021); p. 6, \nsupra.   \nThis Court reversed the Tenth Circuit decision in \nHollyFrontier, holding that a small refinery may be el-\nigible for an exemption renewal even if the refinery had \nallowed a prior exemption to lapse.  HollyFrontier \nCheyenne Ref., LLC v. Renewable Fuels Ass\u2019n, 594 U.S. \n382, 390 (2021).  In the pending D.C. Circuit proceed-\nings, EPA then moved for a voluntary remand without \nvacatur to allow the agency to reconsider its action on \nthe 2018 exemption petitions in light of this Court\u2019s de-\ncision in HollyFrontier, and in light of the Tenth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s analysis in Renewable Fuels Association of addi-\ntional issues this Court had not reached.  See Sinclair \nWyoming Ref. Co., No. 19-1196, Doc. 1911606 (Aug. 25, \n2021).  The D.C. Circuit granted that motion and in-\nstructed EPA to act on the petitions within 120 days.  \nSinclair Wyoming Ref. Co., No. 19-1196, Doc. 1925942 \n(Dec. 8, 2021).   \n2. In December 2021, EPA proposed to deny all \npending small refinery exemption petitions.  86 Fed. \nReg. 70,999 (Dec. 14, 2021); see C.A. App. 520-585.  \nSeeking to create a nationally uniform program, EPA \nproposed to adopt the Tenth Circuit\u2019s reasoning in Re-\nnewable Fuels Association on the issues this Court had \n\n8 \n \nnot considered.  Under that approach, EPA proposed to \ninterpret the pertinent statutory provisions as requir-\ning small refineries seeking exemptions to show that \nRFS compliance itself caused a disproportionate eco-\nnomic hardship.  C.A. App. 545-548.  In accordance with \nthe Tenth Circuit\u2019s analysis, EPA also analyzed whether \nrefineries were able to pass on the costs of RFS compli-\nance to consumers.  The agency concluded that the evi-\ndence supported a rebuttable presumption that such \ncosts \u201care fully passed through to consumers,\u201d so that \nsmall refineries ordinarily would not suffer dispropor-\ntionate economic hardship as a result of RFS compli-\nance.  Id. at 549; see id. at 548-584.  In light of those \nconclusions, EPA proposed to deny all the pending ex-\nemption petitions and sought comment on that pro-\nposed decision.   \nAfter the comment period ended, EPA took two ac-\ntions.  In April 2022\u2014the deadline set by the D.C. Cir-\ncuit to resolve the remanded petitions\u2014EPA denied 36 \nexemption petitions filed by small refineries for the \n2018 compliance year.  Pet. App. 193a; see April 2022 \nDenial of Petitions for Small Refinery Exemptions \nUnder the Renewable Fuel Standard Program, 87 Fed. \nReg. 24,300 (Apr. 25, 2022) (April Notice).  In June \n2022, EPA denied an additional 69 petitions for the \n2016-2021 compliance years.  Pet. App. 48a; see Notice \nof June 2022 Denial of Petitions for Small Refinery Ex-\nemptions Under the Renewable Fuel Standard Pro-\ngram, 87 Fed. Reg. 34,873, 34,874 (June 8, 2022) (June \nNotice).  The two denial actions reflect the same reason-\ning and are based on two principal rationales, one stat-\nutory and one economic.1  The denial actions contain ex-\n \n1  For ease of reference, this brief cites only the April 2022 denial \nwhen discussing reasoning common to both actions. \n\n9 \n \nplicit agency findings that the actions are nationally ap-\nplicable or, in the alternative, that they are based on de-\nterminations of nationwide scope or effect. \nStatutory interpretation.  In the April and June 2022 \ndenial actions, EPA concluded that an extension of the \nsmall refinery exemption under the relevant provisions \nmay be granted only if disproportionate economic hard-\nship was \u201ccaused by RFS compliance.\u201d  Pet. App. 242a.  \nFor relevant context, the agency turned to paragraph \n(A) of 42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9), which established the initial \nblanket exemption for small refineries and the two-year \nextension based on the DOE study.  See 42 U.S.C. \n7545(o)(9)(A) and (B).  The agency observed that para-\ngraph (A) focuses on \u201cwhether compliance with the re-\nquirements of [the RFS program] would impose a [dis-\nproportionate economic hardship] on small refineries.\u201d  \nPet. App. 243a (quoting 42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(A)(ii)(I)).  \nBecause paragraph (B) provides for an extension of the \nexemption provided by paragraph (A), EPA construed \nparagraph (B) to require a similar causal connection be-\ntween RFS compliance and any resulting economic \nhardship.  Id. at 245a.  The agency found it \u201chard to im-\nagine that Congress intended\u201d to permit exemptions for \nhardships resulting from \u201ca broad array of circum-\nstances unrelated to the RFS program.\u201d  Id. at 247a. \nEconomic analysis.  In implementing the RFS pro-\ngram, EPA has made \u201clongstanding and consistent \nfindings\u201d that obligated parties can pass the costs of \nRFS compliance on to purchasers, a phenomenon called \nRIN cost passthrough.  Pet. App. 248a; see, e.g., Alon \nRef. Krotz Springs, Inc. v. EPA, 936 F.3d 628, 649-650 \n(D.C. Cir. 2019) (per curiam) (discussing earlier studies \nreaching this conclusion), cert. denied, 140 S. Ct. 2792 \n(2020).  In the April and June 2022 denial actions, EPA \n\n10 \n \nreassessed and reaffirmed those prior findings.  Pet. \nApp. 248a-303a; see id. at 240a-241a (explaining related \nconcept of \u201cRIN discount\u201d).  After reviewing extensive \nmarket data, the agency determined that \u201call obligated \nparties recover the cost of acquiring RINs by selling the \ngasoline and diesel fuel they produce at the market \nprice, which reflects these RIN costs.\u201d  Id. at 249a.  EPA \nfurther concluded that \u201cRINs are generally widely \navailable in an open and liquid market,\u201d and that the \n\u201ccost of acquiring RINs is the same for all parties.\u201d  \nIbid. \nGiven that all refineries bear the same costs of RFS \ncompliance and can recover those costs by selling at \nmarket price, EPA found that such costs presumptively \ndo not cause disproportionate economic hardship to any \nsmall refinery.  Pet. App. 248a-250a.  EPA determined \nthat none of the petitioning small refineries had rebut-\nted that presumption through evidence about their spe-\ncific circumstances.  Id. at 251a-252a; see id. at 305a-\n310a. \nVenue.  EPA determined that the denial actions are \nsubject to review exclusively in the D.C. Circuit because \nthey are \u201c\u200a\u2018nationally applicable\u2019\u200a\u201d or, in the alternative, \nbecause they are \u201cbased on a determination of \u2018nation-\nwide scope or effect.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. 328a; id. at 187a (same \nfor June 2022 denial action); see April Notice, 87 Fed. \nReg. at 24,300-24,301; June Notice, 87 Fed. Reg. at \n34,874.  The agency explained that the April 2022 denial \naction encompasses petitions from more than 30 small \nrefineries located within 18 States in seven of the ten \nEPA regions and in eight different federal judicial cir-\ncuits.  Pet. App. 329a; see id. at 187a (similar for June \ndenial).  The agency further observed that the denial \nactions are \u201cbased on EPA\u2019s revised interpretation of \n\n11 \n \nthe relevant CAA provisions and the  * * *  RIN cost \npassthrough principles that are applicable to all small \nrefineries no matter the location or market in which \nthey operate.\u201d  Id. at 329a; see id. at 187a-188a. \n3. Six small refineries filed petitions for review in \nthe Fifth Circuit, collectively challenging both denial \nactions.  Pet. App. 2a, 6a.  Various renewable-fuel trade \nassociations were granted leave to intervene as respond-\nents.  See 22-60266 C.A. Doc. 303-1 (Mar. 16, 2023).  The \ncourt granted the petitions for review, vacated the de-\nnial actions as to the six petitioners, and remanded to \nEPA for further proceedings.  Pet. App. 1a-34a. \na. The court of appeals denied EPA\u2019s motion to trans-\nfer the petitions to the D.C. Circuit.  Pet. App. 9a-15a.  \nThe court held that the denial actions are \u201clocally or re-\ngionally applicable\u201d rather than \u201cnationally applicable,\u201d \n42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1), because the actions\u2019 \u201clegal effect\u201d \nis limited to the petitioning refineries, and the actions \ndo not \u201cbind[\u200a] EPA in any future adjudication,\u201d Pet. \nApp. 11a-12a (emphases omitted).   \nThe court of appeals further held that neither denial \naction is \u201cbased on a determination of nationwide scope \nor effect.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  The court acknowl-\nedged, but disagreed with, EPA\u2019s express finding that \nthe denial actions were based on such determinations.  \nPet. App. 12a-14a.  The court noted that, under EPA\u2019s \ninterpretation of the relevant provisions, the agency \nwill review refinery-specific information to determine \nwhether there is any basis to depart from EPA\u2019s gen-\neral conclusions about market conditions and RIN \npassthrough.  Id. at 15a.  The court of appeals concluded \nthat, because \u201cthere is still a non-zero chance [EPA] will \ngrant small refinery petitions\u201d based on \u201cdata and evi-\ndence\u201d about particular refineries\u2019 circumstances, \u201cthe \n\n12 \n \nDenial Actions rely on refinery-specific determinations \nand are not based on a determination of nationwide \nscope or effect.\u201d  Ibid. \nOn the merits, the Fifth Circuit held the denial ac-\ntions unlawful on three grounds.  Pet. App. 16a-33a.  \nFirst, the court found that small refineries have a pro-\ntectable property interest in being exempt from RFS \nprogram obligations, and that EPA had impermissibly \napplied its new analysis retroactively to deprive the re-\nfineries here of that interest.  Id. at 16a.  Second, the \ncourt rejected the agency\u2019s interpretation of the gov-\nerning statutory language.  The court characterized the \nagency\u2019s position as requiring that \u201ccompliance costs \nmust be the sole cause of\u200a\u201d hardship, id. at 23a, and it \ndisagreed on the ground that hardship may have \u201cmyr-\niad causes,\u201d id. at 25a.  Third, the court concluded that \nthe agency had acted arbitrarily and capriciously.  Id. \nat 29a-33a.  Without questioning the agency\u2019s RIN cost \npassthrough analysis as a general matter, id. at 31a \nn.44, the court found that the analysis was undermined \nas to the petitioning refineries by data concerning the \nparticular local markets in which they operate, id. at \n31a-33a. \nb. Judge Higginbotham dissented as to venue.  Pet. \nApp. 35a-43a.  He would have held that the denial ac-\ntions are \u201cnationally applicable\u201d because they \u201capply \none consistent statutory interpretation and economic \nanalysis to thirty-six small refineries, located in eight-\neen different states, in the geographical boundaries of \neight different circuit courts.\u201d  Id. at 38a.  In the alterna-\ntive, he concluded that the denial actions are \u201c\u200a\u2018based on \na determination of nationwide scope or effect\u2019\u200a\u201d because \nthe \u201ctwo determinations at the[ir] core\u201d\u2014the agency\u2019s \nstatutory interpretation and economic analysis\u2014\u201care ap-\n\n13 \n \nplicable to all small refineries no matter the location or \nmarket in which they operate.\u201d  Id. at 40a-42a. \n4. Other small refineries petitioned for review of the \nApril and June 2022 denial actions in the Third, Sev-\nenth, Ninth, Tenth, Eleventh, and D.C. Circuits.  Each \nof the other regional circuits either dismissed the peti-\ntions without prejudice based on improper venue2 or \ntransferred them to the D.C. Circuit.3   \nThe D.C. Circuit consolidated the various petitions \nthat were before it, and on July 26, 2024, the court va-\ncated and remanded the denial actions.  Sinclair Wyo-\nming Ref. Co. v. EPA, 114 F.4th 693 (per curiam).  The \ncourt held that EPA had imposed an \u201coverly strict cau-\nsation requirement\u201d in concluding that only dispropor-\ntionate compliance costs could justify granting an ex-\nemption and in failing to consider certain RIN pur-\nchases as a source of disproportionate economic hard-\nship.

Unlike the Fifth Circuit, however, the \nD.C. Circuit declined to address whether EPA\u2019s ap-\nproach was impermissibly retroactive.  Id. at 714 n.12.   \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nUnder the plain terms of Section 7607(b)(1), the de-\nnial actions here are reviewable only in the D.C. Circuit.  \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s contrary decision imposes atextual \nrequirements and fails to give effect to the provision \nCongress enacted.   \nA.  Under Section 7607(b)(1), \u201cnationally applicable\u201d \nEPA final actions are subject to judicial review only in \nthe D.C. Circuit.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  To apply that \nstatutory requirement, courts consider the final action \non its face and determine whether it applies to entities \nlocated throughout the country rather than in a single \nregion.  The denial actions here qualify as \u201cnationally \napplicable\u201d on that basis:  They resolve exemption peti-\ntions from small refineries located in 18 States and eight \nfederal judicial circuits across the country.   \nStatutory context confirms that result.  Section \n7607(b)(1) distinguishes between \u201cnationally applica-\nble\u201d EPA actions, which are subject to review in the \nD.C. Circuit, and \u201clocally or regionally applicable\u201d ac-\ntions, which are subject to review in \u201cthe appropriate \ncircuit.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1) (emphasis added).  Con-\ngress\u2019s use of the definite article indicates that there is \nonly one \u201cappropriate circuit\u201d for review of any partic-\nular \u201clocally or regionally applicable\u201d action.  When an \nEPA action applies to entities in multiple circuits, no \nsingle regional circuit can be identified as \u201cthe\u201d appro-\n\n15 \n \npriate venue, so the action is properly viewed as \u201cna-\ntionally applicable\u201d rather than \u201clocally or regionally \napplicable.\u201d   \nSection 7607(b)(1)\u2019s legislative history reinforces \nthat conclusion.  That history reflects Congress\u2019s un-\nderstanding that any \u201clocally or regionally applicable\u201d \naction could be reviewed in the regional court of appeals \nwhere the affected entity was located.  Where affected \nentities are spread across multiple circuits, however, \nCongress viewed the D.C. Circuit as the proper venue.   \nIn endorsing the contrary conclusion, both the court \nof appeals and respondents go beyond the statutory text \nto impose additional restrictions on the availability of \nD.C. Circuit review.  The court of appeals required that \nthe final action have a prospective effect on future \nagency decisions.  But the court did not ground that re-\nquirement in the statutory text, and respondents do not \ndefend it.  Respondents instead argue that, for venue \npurposes, the Court should treat the denial of each re-\nfinery\u2019s exemption petition as a separate \u201cfinal action.\u201d  \nBut that requirement likewise is untethered to the stat-\nutory text, and this Court has long recognized that \nagencies have discretion to devise their own procedures, \nincluding by aggregating common issues for joint reso-\nlution.  EPA acted reasonably in taking that approach \nhere.  And in determining the proper venue for chal-\nlenges to the agency\u2019s denial actions, the Court should \nfocus on the actions that EPA actually took, rather than \non a hypothetical array of 105 separate, refinery-specific \ndisapprovals. \nB.  Even if this Court finds the denial actions here to \nbe \u201clocally or regionally applicable,\u201d those actions are \nstill subject to review only in the D.C. Circuit because \nthey are \u201cbased on a determination of nationwide scope \n\n16 \n \nor effect,\u201d and EPA published its findings to that effect \nin accordance with Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s requirements.  \n42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).   \nIn requiring a \u201cdetermination of nationwide scope or \neffect,\u201d the statutory text focuses on the underlying \nreasons for EPA\u2019s final action.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  \nThe final action must be \u201cbased on\u201d the relevant deter-\nminations, indicating that the determinations must be a \nbut-for cause of the agency\u2019s final action\u2014forming the \ncore of the agency\u2019s analysis.  And to be nationwide in \nscope or effect, the core justifications for EPA\u2019s final \naction must be intended to govern the agency\u2019s deci-\nsionmaking in actions throughout the country, or have \nlegal consequences for entities beyond a single judicial \ncircuit.   \nThe denial actions here meet those requirements.  \nEPA found that the denial actions were based on two in-\nterrelated determinations of nationwide scope:  (1) EPA\u2019s \nstatutory interpretation that a small refinery\u2019s dispro-\nportionate economic hardship will support an exemp-\ntion only if it is caused by compliance with the RFS pro-\ngram; and (2) EPA\u2019s economic analysis of the national \nmarket for RINs, which found that the cost to acquire \nRINs is the same for refineries everywhere and is \npassed through to consumers in the price of fuels.  Those \ndeterminations apply to all small refinery exemption re-\nquests under the RFS program as a whole, and they \nwere the core rationales for EPA\u2019s denials of the ex-\nemption requests.   \nStatutory history confirms Congress\u2019s intent that \nEPA actions like the denial actions here would be re-\nviewable in the D.C. Circuit.  The original 1970 version \nof the venue provision did not specifically authorize \nD.C. Circuit review of final actions that are based on a \n\n17 \n \ndetermination of nationwide scope or effect.  That stat-\nutory gap led to litigation over which circuit qualified as \n\u201cthe appropriate circuit\u201d when EPA issued an action \nthat established a legal framework for implementation \nplans that spanned multiple States in multiple judicial \ncircuits.  In amending the statute to its current form, \nCongress adopted the view expressed by EPA\u2019s then-\nGeneral Counsel, who urged that challenges to such ac-\ntions should be channeled to the D.C. Circuit to \u201ccen-\ntralize review\u201d and \u201ctak[e] advantage of [the D.C. Cir-\ncuit\u2019s] administrative law expertise,\u201d thereby \u201cfacilitat-\ning an orderly development of the basic law\u201d that EPA \nwould apply nationwide.  41 Fed. Reg. 56,767, 56,769 \n(Dec. 30, 1976).   \nThe court of appeals and respondents have not dis-\nputed that the EPA actions at issue here rested in part \non interpretive and economic determinations having na-\ntionwide scope or effect.  They have observed, however, \nthat EPA also considered refinery-specific facts in rul-\ning on the exemption requests.  But the statute does not \nrequire that the final action be based solely on determi-\nnations of nationwide scope or effect.  Nor would such a \nlimitation make sense.  The third prong of Section \n7607(b)(1) comes into play only when the challenged \nEPA action is \u201clocally or regionally applicable,\u201d and \nsuch actions almost always will rest at least in part on \nconsideration of local or regional circumstances.  42 \nU.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  \nRespondents are also incorrect in asserting that \nEPA\u2019s interpretation would allow for D.C. Circuit venue \nfor challenges to every locally or regionally applicable \naction.  The statute imposes meaningful limits on EPA\u2019s \nauthority to find that a particular action is \u201cbased on a \ndetermination of nationwide scope or effect.\u201d  Courts \n\n18 \n \nshould enforce those limits without adding more of their \nown making.   \nARGUMENT \nTHE D.C. CIRCUIT IS THE APPROPRIATE VENUE FOR \nREVIEW OF THE DENIAL ACTIONS AT ISSUE HERE \nThe CAA\u2019s venue provision reflects a clear congres-\nsional preference for \u201cuniform judicial review of regula-\ntory issues of national importance.\u201d  National Environ-\nmental Development Ass\u2019n Clean Air Project v. EPA, \n891 F.3d 1041, 1054 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (Silberman, J., con-\ncurring).  Section 7607(b)(1) specifies two distinct cir-\ncumstances in which review of nationally significant \nEPA actions will be channeled to the D.C. Circuit.  First, \nany \u201cnationally applicable\u201d final action is subject to re-\nview exclusively in the D.C. Circuit.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  \nSecond, even if a challenged final action is \u201clocally or \nregionally applicable,\u201d venue lies exclusively in the D.C. \nCircuit if that action is \u201cbased on a determination of na-\ntionwide scope or effect and if in taking such action the \nAdministrator finds and publishes that such action is \nbased on such a determination.\u201d  Ibid.   \nBecause the denial actions at issue here resolve the \nexemption petitions of small refineries across the coun-\ntry, those actions are \u201cnationally applicable\u201d within the \nmeaning of Section 7607(b)(1).  In the alternative, if the \nCourt views the denial actions as \u201clocally or regionally \napplicable,\u201d those EPA actions are based on determina-\ntions of nationwide scope because they are grounded in \nEPA\u2019s statutory interpretation and analysis of market-\nplace conditions, both of which apply to all small refin-\nery exemption requests under the RFS program as a \nwhole.  Section 7607(b)(1) thus requires that challenges \nto the denial actions be brought in the D.C. Circuit. \n\n19 \n \nIndeed, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision in this case pro-\nvides a paradigmatic example of the outcome that Sec-\ntion 7607(b)(1) was intended to prevent.  The two EPA \ndenial actions at issue here collectively covered 105 ex-\nemption petitions from 39 small refineries located in \neight different judicial circuits.  The actions were prem-\nised on a statutory interpretation and an economic anal-\nysis that the agency had not previously announced, and \nthat constituted \u201cdetermination[s] of nationwide scope \nor effect\u201d under any reasonable understanding of that \nphrase.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  The ensuing briefing in \nthe court of appeals focused primarily on those nation-\nwide determinations, not on refinery-specific circum-\nstances.  The denial actions thus are precisely the types \nof EPA actions that Congress regarded as appropriate \nfor centralized D.C. Circuit review. \nUnder the Fifth Circuit\u2019s venue analysis, however, \nthe 25 covered refineries that challenged EPA\u2019s denial \nactions in court could have obtained judicial review only \nthrough individual challenges filed in seven different re-\ngional circuits.  That extreme fragmentation was avoided \nhere only because some refineries initially petitioned \nfor review in the D.C. Circuit, and five other regional \ncircuits either dismissed petitions for lack of venue or \ntransferred petitions to that court.  But if this Court en-\ndorses the Fifth Circuit\u2019s venue analysis, future chal-\nlenges to similar EPA actions can be expected to con-\nsume far greater judicial resources, with consequent \nheightened risks of inconsistent outcomes.  Congress \ncrafted Section 7607(b)(1) to avoid that result, and this \nCourt should vacate the court of appeals\u2019 judgment. \nA. The Denial Actions Are Nationally Applicable \nEach of the two denial actions resolved the exemp-\ntion petitions of more than 30 small refineries located in \n\n20 \n \nmultiple judicial circuits across the country.  It there-\nfore is apparent on the face of the final actions that they \nare \u201cnationally applicable\u201d and subject to review in the \nD.C. Circuit.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  The contrary argu-\nments advanced by the court of appeals and respond-\nents do not contest the reach of the two denial actions \nEPA issued, but instead advocate additional limitations \nthat the statutory text does not impose.   \n1.  The text, context, and history of Section 7607(b)(1) \nmake clear that the denial actions are nationally ap-\nplicable  \nSection 7607(b)(1) instructs that a challenge to a \u201cfi-\nnal action\u201d that is \u201cnationally applicable\u201d must be heard \nin the D.C. Circuit.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  That language \nencompasses the denial actions at issue here because \nthose actions apply to small refineries in multiple judi-\ncial circuits throughout the country.  The statutory con-\ntext and history confirm Congress\u2019s intent that the D.C. \nCircuit would review challenges to such actions.   \na. Under the text of Section 7607(b)(1), the proper \nvenue for challenges to EPA\u2019s implementation of the \nCAA depends on the \u201cfinal action\u201d that is being chal-\nlenged.  The term \u201caction\u201d in Section 7607(b)(1) \u201cis \nmeant to cover comprehensively every manner in which \nan agency may exercise its power.\u201d  Whitman v. Amer-\nican Trucking Ass\u2019ns, 531 U.S. 457, 478 (2001).  And as \nnumerous courts of appeals have recognized, the statu-\ntory text makes clear that venue turns on the nature of \nthe pertinent EPA action rather than on the basis for a \nparticular petitioner\u2019s challenge.  See, e.g., Hunt Ref. \nCo. v. EPA, 90 F.4th 1107, 1110 (11th Cir. 2024); South-\nern Ill. Power Coop. v. EPA, 863 F.3d 666, 671 (7th Cir. \n2017); American Road & Transp. Builders Ass\u2019n v. \nEPA, 705 F.3d 453, 455 (D.C. Cir. 2013), cert. denied, \n\n21 \n \n571 U.S. 1125 (2014); ATK Launch Sys., Inc. v. EPA, \n651 F.3d 1194, 1197 (10th Cir. 2011).  Courts thus must \nlook to the face of the action and determine whether it \napplies to\u2014or includes \u201cwithin its scope,\u201d Black\u2019s Law \nDictionary 91 (5th ed. 1979) (Black\u2019s) (defining \u201cap-\nply\u201d)\u2014entities \u201cthroughout [the] nation,\u201d Webster\u2019s \nThird New International Dictionary of the English \nLanguage 1505 (1976) (Webster\u2019s) (defining \u201cnation-\nally\u201d).     \nStatutory context sheds further light on what geo-\ngraphic scope an action must have to be \u201cnationally ap-\nplicable.\u201d  Under Section 7607(b)(1), each EPA action is \neither \u201cnationally applicable\u201d or \u201clocally or regionally \napplicable.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  In distinguishing be-\ntween those two types of actions, \u201c[t]he text of the stat-\nute leaves no room for an intermediate case.\u201d  Southern \nIll. Power Coop., 863 F.3d at 673.  If the challenged ac-\ntion is \u201cnationally applicable,\u201d the D.C. Circuit is the ex-\nclusive forum for judicial review.  And unless a \u201clocally \nor regionally applicable\u201d action is \u201cbased on a determi-\nnation of nationwide scope or effect,\u201d it may be chal-\nlenged \u201conly in the United States Court of Appeals for \nthe appropriate circuit.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  The stat-\nute\u2019s use of the definite article\u2014\u201cthe appropriate cir-\ncuit,\u201d ibid. (emphasis added)\u2014indicates that, for any \ngiven locally or regionally applicable EPA action, there \nis only one appropriate regional court of appeals in \nwhich to seek review.  Cf. Rumsfeld v. Padilla, 542 U.S. \n426, 434 (2004) (explaining that the \u201cuse of the definite \narticle\u201d in the federal habeas statute \u201cindicates that \n\n22 \n \nthere is generally only one proper respondent to a given \nprisoner\u2019s habeas petition\u201d).4 \nThe existence of a single appropriate court of ap-\npeals for this category of EPA actions in turn conveys \nthat a particular action is \u201clocally or regionally applica-\nble\u201d only if it applies to entities that are confined to a \nsingle judicial circuit.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  After all, \nfor an action that applies equally to entities in more \nthan one judicial circuit, no particular court of appeals \ncan be identified as \u201cthe appropriate circuit\u201d for review.  \nIbid. (emphasis added).  Thus, any action that spans \nmore than one judicial circuit is properly viewed as \u201cna-\ntionally applicable\u201d and subject to review only in the \nD.C. Circuit.  Ibid.   \nb. The history of Section 7607(b)(1) reflects the \nsame understanding.  As originally enacted in 1970, the \nCAA venue provision stated that any action \u201cpromul-\ngating any national primary or secondary ambient air \nquality standard,\u201d \u201cemission standard,\u201d \u201cstandard of \nperformance,\u201d or other specified standards or controls, \nwould be reviewable only in the D.C. Circuit.  42 U.S.C. \n1857h-5(b)(1) (1970).  The provision further specified \nthat any action \u201capproving or promulgating any imple-\nmentation plan\u201d could be reviewed only in \u201cthe appro-\npriate circuit.\u201d  Ibid.  Because that venue provision did \nnot specify the proper court for review of the many EPA \nactions that did not fall within any of the enumerated \ncategories, such actions were reviewable only by dis-\n \n4  Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s reference to \u201cthe appropriate circuit,\u201d 42 \nU.S.C. 7607(b)(1) (emphasis added), contrasts with the preceding \nsubsection, where Congress contemplated the prospect of multiple \npermissible forums by authorizing \u201cthe district court  * * *  for any \ndistrict in which such person is found or resides or transacts busi-\nness\u201d to issue certain orders, 42 U.S.C. 7607(a) (emphasis added). \n\n23 \n \ntrict courts exercising federal-question jurisdiction.  \nSee p. 3, supra.   \nThe actions that Congress specified for D.C. Circuit \nreview in the 1970 statute were all \u201cnational in scope,\u201d \nand Congress sought to ensure that they received \u201ceven \nand consistent national application\u201d through centralized \nreview.  1970 Senate Report 41.  By contrast, Congress \nviewed EPA actions approving or promulgating \u201cimple-\nmentation plans which run only to one air quality con-\ntrol region\u201d as amenable to review \u201cin the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Circuit in which the affected air quality \ncontrol region, or portion thereof, is located,\u201d ibid., \nwhich the statute referred to as \u201cthe appropriate cir-\ncuit,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 1857h-5(b)(1) (1970).   \nWhen Congress amended the statute in 1977 to ex-\npand the scope of direct court of appeals review, it \nadopted the same understanding of the limited geo-\ngraphic scope of actions that would be subject to review \nin \u201cthe appropriate circuit.\u201d  The 1977 House Report ex-\nplained that the revision would \u201cprovide[] for essen-\ntially locally, statewide, or regionally applicable rules or \norders to be reviewed in the U.S. court of appeals for \nthe circuit in which such locality, State, or region is lo-\ncated.\u201d  1977 House Report 323.  And the House Report \ncontrasted such local actions with nationally relevant \nactions that extend \u201cbeyond a single judicial circuit\u201d \nand therefore should be subject to centralized D.C. Cir-\ncuit review.  Id. at 324.  That history reinforces the con-\nclusion that, under the venue provision in its current \nform, final EPA actions that apply to entities in multiple \njudicial circuits are reviewable only in the D.C. Circuit.   \nc. Applying that understanding here, the denial ac-\ntions are nationally applicable.  EPA \u201cexercise[d] its \npower\u201d through two final denial actions, each of which \n\n24 \n \napplies to multiple entities located throughout the coun-\ntry in multiple federal judicial circuits.  Whitman, 531 \nU.S. at 478.  The April 2022 denial action covers \u201c36  \n* * *  petitions for exemptions from the RFS program \nfor over 30 small refineries across the country and ap-\nplies to small refineries located within 18 states in 7 of \nthe 10 EPA regions and in 8 different federal judicial \ncircuits.\u201d  Pet. App. 329a.  The June 2022 denial action \ncovers \u201c69 petitions for exemptions from the RFS pro-\ngram for over 30 small refineries across the country and \napplies to small refineries located within 15 states in 7 \nof the 10 EPA regions and in 8 different Federal judicial \ncircuits.\u201d  Id. at 187a.  On a plain-text understanding, \neach of the two denial actions is therefore \u201cnationally \napplicable,\u201d and respondents\u2019 challenges to those ac-\ntions can proceed only in the D.C. Circuit.  42 U.S.C. \n7607(b)(1); see Hunt Ref. Co., 90 F.4th at 1110.   \n2.  The court of appeals\u2019 and respondents\u2019 contrary rea-\nsoning is inconsistent with the statutory text  \nNeither the court of appeals nor respondents have \ndisputed that the denial actions at issue here apply to \nsmall refineries in multiple judicial circuits across the \ncountry.  Nor have they disputed the general proposi-\ntion that, when an EPA final action applies to entities in \nmultiple judicial circuits, that action is \u201cnationally ap-\nplicable\u201d within the meaning of Section 7607(b)(1).  The \ncourt of appeals nevertheless held that the denial ac-\ntions are not \u201cnationally applicable\u201d because those ac-\ntions apply only to the specific refineries whose exemp-\ntion petitions EPA adjudicated, and those adjudications \nwill not bind the agency in any future proceeding.  Re-\nspondents have not endorsed that rationale, but have \nargued instead that the denial actions should be viewed \nfor venue purposes as 105 separate denials of 105 ex-\n\n25 \n \nemption petitions, each of which is confined to a single \njudicial circuit.  Those arguments lack merit. \na. The court of appeals found it significant that the \ndenial actions apply only to the petitioning refineries \nand do not \u201cbind[] EPA in any future adjudication.\u201d  \nPet. App. 12a.  But the court did not attempt to tether \nthat observation to the statutory text.  And nothing in \nSection 7607(b)(1) suggests that a final action must bind \nEPA prospectively in order to be considered \u201cnationally \napplicable.\u201d  The court of appeals erred by effectively \n\u201cadd[ing] words  * * *  to the statute Congress enacted\u201d \nand \u201cimpos[ing] a new requirement\u201d that atextually lim-\nits the category of actions encompassed within Section \n7607(b)(1)\u2019s first category.  Muldrow v. City of St. \nLouis, 601 U.S. 346, 355 (2024).   \nIndeed, under the court of appeals\u2019 approach, virtu-\nally no adjudicatory actions would be deemed \u201cnation-\nally applicable\u201d because agency adjudications typically \n\u201clack \u2018legal effect\u2019 beyond the parties involved.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 39a (Higginbotham, J., dissenting).  But the venue \nprovision at issue here refers broadly to \u201cany other na-\ntionally applicable regulations promulgated, or final ac-\ntion taken.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1) (emphasis added).  \nSuch \u201cexpansive language\u201d is not amenable to the kind \nof \u201climiting construction\u201d the court of appeals\u2019 analysis \nwould impose.  Harrison v. PPG Industries, Inc., 446 \nU.S. 578, 589 (1980); see Whitman, 531 U.S. at 478.  \nElsewhere in Section 7607(b)(1), Congress distinguished \namong particular agency actions by referring specifi-\ncally to a \u201cregulation[]\u201d or \u201corder.\u201d  42 U.S.C 7607(b)(1).  \nIn contrast, Congress\u2019s reference to \u201cany other nation-\nally applicable  * * *  final action\u201d should be given its \nnatural meaning rather than subjected to artificial con-\nstraints.  Ibid.; cf. Nielsen v. Preap, 586 U.S. 392, 414 \n\n26 \n \n(2019) (presuming that \u201cevery word and every provi-\nsion\u201d in a statute \u201cis to be given effect\u201d) (citation omit-\nted).   \nb. Respondents do not defend the court of appeals\u2019 \nreliance on the adjudicative character of the denial ac-\ntions.  Instead, respondents contend (Br. in Opp. 17-21) \nthat, for purposes of the venue provision, the relevant \n\u201cfinal action[s]\u201d are not the two denial actions issued in \nApril and June of 2022, but rather 105 separate denials \nof the various petitioning refineries\u2019 exemption re-\nquests.  That is incorrect.   \nRespondents argue that here, \u201c[t]he final EPA action \n\u2018under\u2019 the CAA is EPA\u2019s adjudication of individual \nhardship petitions.\u201d  Br. in Opp. 18.  Respondents high-\nlight the fact that Section 7545(o)(9)(B) allows \u201ca small \nrefinery\u201d to petition for an exemption and requires EPA \nto \u201cevaluat[e] a petition.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(B) (em-\nphases added).  But neither that CAA provision nor any \nother restricts EPA\u2019s ability to consider petitions to-\ngether and resolve common issues in a single action.  \nThe court of appeals recognized that \u201c[w]ithout more,\u201d \nthe use of \u201can indefinite article immediately followed \nwith a singular noun\u201d does not \u201cshow that the relevant \nstatutory provisions require EPA to consider exemp-\ntion petitions individually.\u201d  Pet. App. 29a.   \nThe Dictionary Act, ch. 71, 16 Stat. 431, instructs \nthat, \u201cunless the context indicates otherwise[,] words \nimporting the singular include and apply to several per-\nsons, parties, or things.\u201d  1 U.S.C. 1.  Here, the context \nprovides no reason to doubt that EPA may evaluate \nmultiple petitions in a single action.  Indeed, this Court \nhas long recognized that administrative agencies \n\u201cshould be free to fashion their own rules of procedure \nand to pursue methods of inquiry capable of permitting \n\n27 \n \nthem to discharge their multitudinous duties.\u201d  FCC v. \nPottsville Broadcasting Co., 309 U.S. 134, 143 (1940); \nsee Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural \nResources Defense Council, 435 U.S. 519, 524 (1978) \n(\u201c[T]his Court has for more than four decades empha-\nsized that the formulation of procedures was basically \nto be left within the discretion of the agencies to which \nCongress had confided the responsibility for substan-\ntive judgments.\u201d).  That discretion includes the ability \nto determine \u201cwhether applications should be heard \ncontemporaneously or successively.\u201d  Pottsville, 309 \nU.S. at 138.  Section 7545(o)(9)(B)\u2019s use of an indefinite \narticle is an insufficient basis for inferring any con-\nstraint on EPA\u2019s discretion to aggregate similar peti-\ntions for joint resolution.    \nThere is nothing unusual or problematic about EPA\u2019s \ndecision to group the various exemption petitions to de-\ncide the common issues that affect refineries across the \ncountry.  That approach aligns with Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s \naim to promote national uniformity and with EPA\u2019s \nlongstanding practice of resolving similar issues in a \nsingle action to ensure consistent treatment.  See ATK \nLaunch Sys., 651 F.3d at 1197 (single EPA action prom-\nulgating air quality designations for 31 areas across 18 \nStates); RMS of Ga., LLC v. EPA, 64 F.4th 1368, 1371 \n(11th Cir. 2023) (single EPA action adjudicating allow-\nance requests and issuing allowances to 32 entities to \nconsume hydrofluorocarbons); West Virginia Chamber \nof Commerce v. Browner, 166 F.3d 336 (4th Cir. 1998) \n(Tbl.) (per curiam) (single EPA action declaring that 22 \nStates\u2019 implementation plans were inadequate and re-\nquired revisions).  Indeed, such aggregation generally \nis encouraged as a means of efficiently adjudicating \ncommon issues.  See Committee on Adjudication, Ad-\n\n28 \n \nministrative Conference of the United States, Aggrega-\ntion of Similar Claims in Agency Adjudication (June \n13, 2016), https://perma.cc/2UQS-TJ6F. \nEPA\u2019s approach was particularly sensible here.  \nEPA was considering the exemption petitions in light of \nthis Court\u2019s decision in HollyFrontier, and in light of \nthe Tenth Circuit\u2019s reasoning in Renewable Fuels Asso-\nciation on issues this Court had not addressed.  See pp. \n6-7, supra.  EPA grouped the petitions together for res-\nolution in order to \u201capply one consistent statutory in-\nterpretation and economic analysis to thirty-six small \nrefineries, located in eighteen different states, in the ge-\nographical boundaries of eight different circuit courts.\u201d  \nPet. App. 38a (Higginbotham, J., dissenting); see also \npp. 7-8, supra.   \nIn making prior exemption decisions, EPA has some-\ntimes declined to group multiple petitions for resolution \nin a single action because the agency concluded that the \ncircumstances did not call for such treatment.  When \nEPA has issued decisions on petitions from individual \nsmall refineries, EPA has recognized that the actions \nare locally or regionally applicable.  See, e.g., Producers \nof Renewables United for Integrity Truth & Transpar-\nency v. EPA, No. 18-1202, Doc. 1775897 (D.C. Cir. Mar. \n4, 2019).  But whichever course EPA chooses in a par-\nticular instance, it is the face of the final action that de-\ntermines the proper venue.  \nRespondents\u2019 position would require the court where \na petition for review is filed to look behind EPA\u2019s char-\nacterization of its own agency action and potentially \nsubstitute a judicial determination of the relevant unit \nof analysis.  But respondents provide little guidance on \nhow courts would make that determination.  Lower \ncourts confronted with such arguments have generally \n\n29 \n \nrejected requests to second-guess EPA\u2019s own framing \nand have focused solely on the face of the final agency \naction.  See, e.g., Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. EPA, 45 F.4th \n380, 387 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (rejecting petitioner\u2019s argu-\nment that EPA\u2019s construction and application to a spe-\ncific context of \u201cnationally applicable provisions of the \nClean Air Act\u201d rendered the agency action itself nation-\nally applicable); Sierra Club v. EPA, 47 F.4th 738, 744 \n(D.C. Cir. 2022) (rejecting petitioner\u2019s argument that \nEPA\u2019s approvals of Texas\u2019s state implementation plans \nwere nationally applicable because EPA had announced \na new understanding that would apply in other loca-\ntions, thereby \u201ceffectively amend[ing] the agency\u2019s na-\ntional implementation regulations\u201d); Southern Ill. Power \nCoop., 863 F.3d at 671 (rejecting petitioner\u2019s argument \nthat EPA\u2019s designations of nonattainment areas were \nan \u201camalgamation of many different locally or region-\nally applicable actions\u201d); RMS of Ga., 64 F.4th at 1374 \n(rejecting petitioner\u2019s argument that an allocation of al-\nlowances among entities should be considered a \u201cdocu-\nment detailing many smaller individual actions\u201d).   \nFocusing on the face of the EPA action has allowed \ncourts and litigants to quickly and efficiently determine \nwhere venue lies, preventing wasteful expenditure of \nresources resolving threshold issues, and furthering \nSection 7607(b)(1)\u2019s purpose of \u201cprioritiz[ing] efficiency.\u201d  \nNational Ass\u2019n of Mfrs. v. Department of Defense, 583 \nU.S. 109, 130 (2018).  Respondents\u2019 approach, by con-\ntrast, would \u201cintroduce[] needless uncertainty into the \ndetermination of venue, where the need for clear rules \nis especially acute.\u201d  Southern Ill. Power Coop., 863 F.3d \nat 673.   \n\n30 \n \nB. The Denial Actions At Issue Here Are Based On Deter-\nminations Of Nationwide Scope Or Effect \nEven if the Court concludes that EPA\u2019s denial ac-\ntions here are \u201clocally or regionally applicable,\u201d those \nactions still are reviewable exclusively in the D.C. Cir-\ncuit.  Those actions are \u201cbased on a determination of na-\ntionwide scope or effect,\u201d and EPA published findings \nto that effect.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).   \n1.  The denial actions at issue here were based on deter-\nminations of nationwide scope \nUnder Section 7607(b)(1), a final action that is \u201clo-\ncally or regionally applicable\u201d is nonetheless reviewable \nin the D.C. Circuit if it is \u201cbased on a determination of \nnationwide scope or effect, and if in taking such action \nthe Administrator finds and publishes that such action \nis based on such a determination.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  \nThere is no dispute that EPA published the requisite \nfindings.  See Pet. App. 12a-13a; see also April Notice, \n87 Fed. Reg. at 24,301; June Notice, 87 Fed. Reg. at \n34,874.  Those findings were correct.   \na. A \u201cdetermination\u201d is a \u201cdecision arrived at or \npromulgated; a determinate sentence, conclusion, or \nopinion.\u201d  4 The Oxford English Dictionary 548 (2d ed. \n1989) (OED); see Webster\u2019s 616 (\u201cthe settling and end-\ning of a controversy esp. by judicial decision\u201d; \u201cthe re-\nsolving of a question by argument or reasoning\u201d).  The \ntext of Section 7607(b)(1) distinguishes between the \nagency\u2019s \u201cfinal action\u201d and the relevant underlying \u201cde-\ntermination.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  A particular EPA \naction may reflect multiple agency determinations, but \nby referring to \u201ca determination of nationwide scope or \neffect,\u201d Section 7607(b)(1) authorizes D.C. Circuit venue \n(if EPA publishes the requisite finding) so long as any \n\n31 \n \nsingle determination of that kind forms the basis of the \naction.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1) (emphasis added).   \nRequiring that the action be \u201c\u200a\u2018based on\u2019\u200a\u201d the rele-\nvant determination ordinarily \u201cindicates a but-for causal \nrelationship and thus a necessary logical condition.\u201d  \nSafeco Ins. Co. of Am. v. Burr, 551 U.S. 47, 63 (2007).  \nEPA\u2019s actions may be\u2014and frequently are\u2014based on \nmultiple determinations, and courts have long accepted \nsuch independent causes as adequate.  See Bostock v. \nClayton County, 590 U.S. 644, 656 (2020) (noting that \n\u201c[o]ften, events have multiple but-for causes\u201d that can \nbe sufficient to trigger liability).  Under \u201cthe traditional \nbut-for causation standard,\u201d causation cannot be de-\nfeated \u201cjust by citing some other factor that contributed \nto [the] challenged  * * *  decision.\u201d  Ibid.  \u201cSo long as\u201d \nthe relevant determination \u201cwas one but-for cause of \nth[e] decision, that is enough to trigger the law.\u201d  Ibid.  \nThus, under Section 7607(b)(1), the relevant determina-\ntions must \u201clie at the core of the agency action\u201d and can-\nnot be \u201c[m]erely peripheral or extraneous.\u201d  Texas v. \nEPA, 829 F.3d 405, 419 (5th Cir. 2016).   \nSection 7607(b)(1) further provides that venue may \nbe appropriate in the D.C. Circuit when the relevant de-\ntermination has \u201cnationwide scope or effect.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n7607(b)(1) (emphasis added).  \u201cScope\u201d means \u201cthe gen-\neral range or extent of cognizance, consideration, activ-\nity, or influence.\u201d  Webster\u2019s 2035; see 14 OED 672 \n(\u201c[R]ange of application or of subjects embraced.\u201d).  \n\u201cEffect\u201d generally means \u201csomething that is produced \nby an agent or cause.\u201d  Webster\u2019s 724; see 5 OED 79 (\u201cTo \nbring about\u201d; \u201cto accomplish\u201d).  When used with respect \nto a statute, \u201ceffect\u201d refers to \u201c[t]he result  * * *  which \na statute will produce upon the existing law.\u201d  Black\u2019s \n462.  Applying that definition in the context of agency \n\n32 \n \naction, the \u201ceffect\u201d of an agency determination refers to \nthe legal consequences that determination produces.  \nThus, Section 7607(b)(1) allows for D.C. Circuit review \nwhen EPA\u2019s final action sets out as a core justification \na principle or conclusion that is intended to govern the \nagency\u2019s decisionmaking in actions throughout the coun-\ntry, or when a central rationale for EPA\u2019s final action \nhas legal consequences for entities beyond a single ju-\ndicial circuit.   \nUnder the third prong of Section 7607(b)(1), a locally \nor regionally applicable action is reviewable in the D.C. \nCircuit only if (a) the action \u201cis based on a determina-\ntion of nationwide scope or effect\u201d and (b) EPA \u201cfinds \nand publishes that such action is based on such a deter-\nmination.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  When EPA publishes \nthe specified finding, a person who seeks review of the \npertinent EPA action may argue that the finding is in-\ncorrect and that venue therefore lies in a regional cir-\ncuit.  In such cases, any disputes about the meaning of \nthe phrase \u201cdetermination of nationwide scope or ef-\nfect\u201d will present questions of statutory interpretation \nthat courts must decide de novo.  See Loper Bright En-\nterprises v. Raimondo, 144 S. Ct. 2244, 2266 (2024).  But \nEPA\u2019s finding that the statutory standard is satisfied \nwith respect to a particular final action ordinarily will be \ngoverned by the arbitrary-and-capricious standard.  See \n5 U.S.C. 706(2)(A) (requiring application of arbitrary-\nand-capricious standard to \u201cagency action, findings, and \nconclusions\u201d); cf. 42 U.S.C. 7607(d)(9) (requiring appli-\ncation of arbitrary-and-capricious standard to particu-\nlar EPA actions).  That deferential standard of review \naccounts for the fact that EPA has obvious knowledge \nand expertise with respect to the centrality of the rele-\nvant \u201cdetermination\u201d to the agency\u2019s own decisionmaking \n\n33 \n \nprocess.  See Marsh v. Oregon Natural Resources Coun-\ncil, 490 U.S. 360, 376-377 (1989) (applying arbitrary-and-\ncapricious review to a \u201cfactual dispute\u201d as to whether \n\u201cnew information undermines conclusions\u201d the agency \nreached because such a question \u201cimplicates substantial \nagency expertise\u201d). \nBy contrast, nothing in the statute requires EPA to \n\u201cfind[] and publish[] that [an] action is based on  * * *  a \ndetermination\u201d of nationwide scope or effect, 42 U.S.C. \n7607(b)(1), even when the facts and law would support \nsuch a finding.  Rather, when EPA declines to publish \nsuch a finding, that decision \u201cis committed to the agency\u2019s \ndiscretion and thus is unreviewable,\u201d Sierra Club, 47 \nF.4th at 745, and it effectively precludes D.C. Circuit \nvenue under Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s third prong.  Thus, for \nany locally or regionally applicable action that is based \non a determination of nationwide scope or effect, Con-\ngress \u201centrusted EPA with discretion to determine the \nproper venue as the agency sees fit.\u201d  Id. at 746; accord \nTexas v. EPA, 983 F.3d 826, 834-835 (5th Cir. 2020).  If \nEPA concludes that a regional circuit is \u201cbest equipped \nto evaluate\u201d a particular agency action based on \u201clocal \nmarket conditions,\u201d Br. in Opp. 21, EPA may decline to \npublish the relevant finding, thereby ensuring that the \nregional circuit will have venue over any challenge to \nthe action. \nb. As EPA correctly found, the denial actions at is-\nsue here were \u201cbased on\u201d two interrelated \u201cdetermina-\ntion[s] of nationwide scope.\u201d  See April Notice, 87 Fed. \nReg. at 24,301; June Notice, 87 Fed. Reg. at 34,874.  \nFirst, the agency adopted a new interpretation of 42 \nU.S.C. 7545(o)(9)(B), construing that provision to re-\nquire that any qualifying hardship \u201cmust be caused by \ncompliance with the RFS program\u201d rather than by \n\n34 \n \nsome unrelated circumstance.  Pet. App. 242a (capitali-\nzation and emphasis altered).  Second, EPA deter-\nmined, as a matter of economic reality, that every refin-\nery recovers the cost of the RIN at the time it sells a \ngallon of fuel.  See id. at 249a.  And because the \u201crefin-\ning and fuel blending markets are highly competitive,\u201d \nEPA found that \u201cRINs are generally widely available in \nan open and liquid market,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he cost of ac-\nquiring RINs is the same for all parties\u201d\u2014features that \n\u201cfacilitate the RIN cost passthrough.\u201d  Ibid.  In light of \nthose two determinations, EPA concluded that, absent \nunusual circumstances, compliance with the RFS pro-\ngram cannot cause disproportionate economic hardship \nto small refineries.   \nAs an interpretation of the statute and an analysis of \nthe national fuels and RIN markets that govern all \nsmall refineries throughout the country seeking exemp-\ntions from the RFS program, EPA\u2019s determinations are \n\u201cnationwide\u201d in scope.  Pet. App. 327a-328a.  That EPA \nadopted and applied those determinations uniformly to \nsmall refineries across the country is evidence of that \nfact.  Those core determinations played a decisive role \nin EPA\u2019s denial actions, leading EPA to presume that \nthe petitioning small refineries across the country had \nnot experienced disproportionate economic hardship\u2014\na presumption that EPA concluded no individual refin-\neries had succeeded in rebutting.  See id. at 15a.  And \nthose determinations were essential to the validity of \nthe challenged denial actions, such that judicial rejec-\ntion of either determination would provide a sufficient \nbasis for reversing the actions.5 \n \n5  Under the RFS program, EPA establishes percentage stand-\nards each year that all obligated parties must use to satisfy their \n \n\n35 \n \nIndeed, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s ultimate merits disposi-\ntion of the petitions for review here confirms that the \nchallenged denial actions were \u201cbased on\u201d the statutory \ninterpretation and economic analysis described above.  \nIn this case the Fifth Circuit, having concluded that \nEPA\u2019s statutory interpretation was inconsistent with \nthe CAA\u2019s text (Pet. App. 23a-27a) and that \u201cEPA\u2019s \nRIN-passthrough theory [was] contrary to the evi-\ndence\u201d (id. at 30a; see id. at 29a-33a), granted the peti-\ntions for review and vacated the denial actions.  See id. \nat 34a.  If judicial invalidation of the relevant determi-\nnation would provide a sufficient basis for finding the \nfinal action itself to be \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse \nof discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,\u201d \n42 U.S.C. 7607(d)(9)(A); 5 U.S.C. 706(2), then the deter-\nmination is properly viewed as \u201ca necessary logical con-\ndition\u201d of the action, Safeco, 551 U.S. at 63, and the req-\nuisite causal relationship exists.  \nc. The statutory history confirms that Congress in-\ntended for final actions like those at issue here to be \nsubject to review in the D.C. Circuit.   \n \nportion of the nationwide target volumes, see p. 4, supra.  When \nEPA anticipates granting an exemption petition at the time it estab-\nlishes the percentage standard, it accounts for that exemption by \nshifting the pro rata burden to other obligated parties.  See Pet. \nApp. 248a & n.139.  If EPA later grants an exemption it did not an-\nticipate, the result is that the national target volumes will not be \nreached for that year.  See id. at 246a & n.135.  EPA\u2019s exemption \ndecisions thus implicate the legal obligations of all non-exempt re-\nfineries across the country.  That reality further underscores the \nneed for nationwide uniformity, and thus the appropriateness of \nD.C. Circuit review, which ensures that uniform standards will ap-\nply and that no refinery will receive a competitive advantage based \non the happenstance of the circuit in which it is located. \n\n36 \n \nBefore Congress amended the venue provision to au-\nthorize D.C. Circuit review of locally or regionally ap-\nplicable actions with nationwide scope or effect, the \n1970 statute made the approval or promulgation of state \nor federal plans reviewable in \u201cthe appropriate circuit.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. 1857h-5(b)(1) (1970).  Disputes concerning \nthat language spawned protracted litigation.  See David \nP. Currie, Judicial Review Under Federal Pollution \nLaws, 62 Iowa L. Rev. 1221, 1262-1269 (1977) (Currie).  \nParties faced a lack of clarity as to which circuit was \n\u201cthe appropriate circuit\u201d when a petitioner challenged a \nfinal action pertaining to state implementation plans \nsubmitted by multiple states spanning multiple judicial \ncircuits.  Id. at 1264.   \nIn light of that uncertainty, one petitioner filed iden-\ntical petitions in ten regional circuits, with an eleventh \nin the D.C. Circuit, and then asked each of the regional \ncircuits to transfer the case to the D.C. Circuit for res-\nolution.  Currie 1263.  Five courts of appeals agreed to \ndo so, while the other five stayed proceedings pending \nthe disposition of the D.C. Circuit case.  Ibid.  Each of \nthe petitions challenged an EPA action that had ap-\nproved numerous state implementation plans based on \nthe agency\u2019s determination that the attainment dead-\nlines for certain pollutants should be extended because \nnecessary control measures would not be available in \nthe time otherwise prescribed.  See Natural Resources \nDefense Council v. EPA, 475 F.2d 968, 969-970 (D.C. \nCir. 1973) (per curiam). \nIn an opinion approving a transfer and finding the \nD.C. Circuit to be \u201cthe appropriate circuit,\u201d the First \nCircuit explained that \u201c[t]he legal issues raised by peti-\ntioners in the\u201d various pending cases \u201cseem[ed] to be \nidentical,\u201d and that \u201clitigation in several circuits, with \n\n37 \n \npossible delayed results on the merits, can only serve to \nfrustrate the strong Congressional interest in improv-\ning the environment.\u201d  Natural Resources Defense \nCouncil v. EPA, 465 F.2d 492, 494 (1st Cir. 1972) (per \ncuriam).  The D.C. Circuit agreed, explaining that \n\u201c[n]one of the[] issues\u201d raised by the petitions \u201cinvolve \nfacts or laws peculiar to any one jurisdiction; rather, all \nconcern uniform determinations of nationwide effect \nmade by the Administrator.\u201d  Natural Resources De-\nfense Council, 475 F.2d at 970.   \nIn 1976, the Administrative Conference of the United \nStates (ACUS) drafted recommendations for amending \nand clarifying the CAA venue provision.  41 Fed. Reg. \nat 56,767.  ACUS urged Congress to \u201cclarify[] that the \nappropriate circuit is the one containing the state whose \nplan is challenged.\u201d  Ibid.  EPA General Counsel G. Wil-\nliam Frick provided additional views, however, and \ncounseled that \u201cwhere \u2018national issues\u2019 are involved \nthey should be reviewed in the D.C. Circuit.\u201d  Id. at \n56,768.  Frick noted that, although EPA actions involv-\ning state implementation plans \u201cusually involve issues \npeculiar to the affected States, such actions sometimes \ninvolve generic determinations of nationwide scope or \neffect.\u201d  Id. at 56,768-56,769.  In Frick\u2019s view, \u201cCongress \nintended review in the D.C. Circuit of \u2018matters on which \nnational uniformity is desirable\u2019\u200a\u201d because of \u201cthe D.C. \nCircuit\u2019s obvious expertise in administrative law mat-\nters\u201d and its familiarity with the CAA\u2019s \u201ccomplex\u201d text \nand history.  Id. at 56,769.  Citing the Natural Re-\nsources Defense Council cases as illustrative, Frick ex-\nplained that it \u201cmakes sense to centralize review of \u2018na-\ntional\u2019 [state implementation plan] issues in the D.C. \nCircuit, taking advantage of its administrative law ex-\npertise and facilitating an orderly development of the \n\n38 \n \nbasic law under the Act, rather than to have such issues \ndecided separately by a number of courts.\u201d  Ibid. \nBy authorizing D.C. Circuit review of final EPA ac-\ntions that are based on \u201cdetermination[s] of nationwide \nscope or effect,\u201d the 1977 amendments incorporated \nFrick\u2019s own language.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1); see 41 Fed. \nReg. at 56,768-56,769.  The House Report that accompa-\nnied the 1977 amendments \u201cconcur[red]\u201d with Frick\u2019s \n\u201ccomments, concerns, and recommendation.\u201d  1977 House \nReport 324.  That history reflects Congress\u2019s awareness \nthat, even when a particular EPA action specifically ad-\ndresses a single State, region, or entity, judicial review \nof the action may implicate national concerns.  After \nconsidering the competing viewpoints expressed by \nACUS and Frick as to the proper means of resolving \nthose national issues, Congress opted to authorize uni-\nform resolution by providing a mechanism for exclusive \nD.C. Circuit review.  \n2.  The court of appeals\u2019 and respondents\u2019 contrary rea-\nsoning would render the \u201cnationwide scope or effect\u201d \nprong of Section 7607(b)(1) practically insignificant \nThe court of appeals and respondents have largely \nignored the determinations of nationwide scope or ef-\nfect that EPA identified.  The court and respondents \nhave focused instead on the refinery-specific circum-\nstances that EPA also considered in the course of de-\ntermining whether individual refineries could rebut the \npresumption the agency had established.  That myopic \napproach is inconsistent with the statutory text and \nwould severely undercut the intended reach of the third \nprong of Section 7607(b)(1).  Under the correct inter-\npretation of the statute, that prong has both meaningful \nreach and meaningful limits, each designed to further \nCongress\u2019s purpose of channeling to the D.C. Circuit \n\n39 \n \nthose challenges that are likely to raise issues of na-\ntional importance.   \na. The Fifth Circuit erred in rejecting EPA\u2019s finding \nthat the denial actions are based on determinations of \nnationwide scope or effect.  The court stated that EPA\u2019s \nstatutory interpretation and economic analysis\u2014\u201cwithout \nmore\u201d\u2014\u201cfail to provide the agency with a sufficient ba-\nsis to adjudicate exemption petitions.\u201d  Pet. App. 15a.  \nThe court observed that, in ruling on a specific exemp-\ntion request, EPA must examine \u201crefinery-specific\u201d \nfacts to ensure that local circumstances do not warrant \na departure from the agency\u2019s general economic analy-\nsis.  Ibid.  Respondents likewise emphasize (Br. in Opp. \n23) that EPA considered \u201clocal facts and data\u201d in deter-\nmining that the refineries\u2019 exemption requests should \nbe denied. \nIn treating that aspect of EPA\u2019s methodology as de-\ncisive, the court and respondents would effectively limit \nD.C. Circuit venue under Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s third \nprong to review of EPA actions that are based solely on \ndeterminations of nationwide scope or effect.  Nothing \nin the statutory text supports that approach.  Where \nCongress intended to require such a limitation, it said \nso explicitly.  See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1) (providing \nan exception to the statute\u2019s 60-day filing window where \nthe \u201cpetition is based solely on grounds arising after\u201d \nthat time period expires) (emphasis added); cf. Bostock, \n590 U.S. at 656 (\u201cAs it has in other statutes, [Congress] \ncould have added \u2018solely\u2019 to indicate that actions taken \n\u2018because of\u200a\u2019 the confluence of multiple factors do not vi-\nolate the law.\u201d).  And this approach would effectively \npreclude application of Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s third prong \nto adjudications, which by their nature involve discrete \n\n40 \n \nparties and virtually always implicate at least some \nparty-specific facts and judgments.  Cf. p. 25, supra.   \nMore fundamentally, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s approach \nwould largely drain the \u201cnationwide scope or effect\u201d \nprong of any practical significance.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  \nBy its terms, Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s third prong applies \nonly to actions that are \u201clocally or regionally applica-\nble.\u201d  Ibid.  Nearly all such actions can be expected to \nrest at least in part on consideration of local or regional \ncircumstances.  Yet on the Fifth Circuit\u2019s view, EPA\u2019s \nconsideration of such circumstances as one aspect of its \nanalysis suffices to preclude application of Section \n7607(b)(1)\u2019s third prong.   \nAs explained above (see pp. 37-38, supra), Congress \nenacted Section 7607(b)(1) in its current form after \nEPA\u2019s then-General Counsel highlighted the fact that \nEPA\u2019s approval and promulgation of implementation \nplans for individual States, which will necessarily rest \nat least in part on State-specific circumstances, can also \nraise issues of national significance for which D.C. Cir-\ncuit review is appropriate.  See 41 Fed. Reg. at 56,769.  \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision thus contravenes Con-\ngress\u2019s purpose of centralizing review of national issues \nin the D.C. Circuit and prioritizing the efficient resolu-\ntion of those issues, even when the actions also address \nlocal or regional concerns.  See Pet. App. 43a (Hig-\nginbotham, J., dissenting).   \nb. Respondents also contend that, because \u201cEPA in \nevery action [must] apply a uniform approach to simi-\nlarly affected parties,\u201d adopting the government\u2019s in-\nterpretation would allow D.C. Circuit venue for chal-\nlenges to every locally or regionally applicable EPA ac-\ntion.  Br. in Opp. 25-26.  That is incorrect.  The statutory \n\n41 \n \ntext includes significant limitations that would prevent \nthat result.   \ni. As an initial matter, the relevant language in Sec-\ntion 7607(b)(1) imposes a causation requirement, au-\nthorizing D.C. Circuit venue only when the challenged \nagency action is \u201cbased on a determination of nation-\nwide scope or effect.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1) (emphasis \nadded).  See pp. 30-31, supra.  EPA\u2019s finding that such \na standard is satisfied is subject to arbitrary-and- \ncapricious review.  See p. 32, supra.  That causation re-\nquirement ensures that D.C. Circuit review will be \navailable only if the relevant determinations are at the \ncore of EPA\u2019s action.  For the reasons already ex-\nplained, ibid., that causation requirement is satisfied \nhere\u2014but it will not be satisfied for every EPA action. \nii. The word \u201cdetermination\u201d suggests a resolution \nof an unsettled issue.  See Webster\u2019s 616 (\u201cthe settling \nand ending of a controversy esp. by judicial decision\u201d).  \nOn that understanding, EPA does not make a \u201cdetermi-\nnation of nationwide scope\u201d when it merely applies a \npreviously established agency rule, policy, or interpre-\ntation to new \u201clocally or regionally applicable\u201d circum-\nstances, even if EPA has previously expressed its intent \nthat the relevant agency rule or policy will apply nation-\nwide.  In deciding whether an EPA rule or policy con-\nstitutes a \u201cdetermination\u201d when the agency applies it in \ntaking a new action, the court may consider whether \nEPA announced the rule or policy at roughly the same \ntime as the challenged agency action itself.  The court \nmay also consider whether the participants in any  \nnotice-and-comment period or comparable agency pro-\nceeding leading up to the challenged action contested \nthe validity of the rule or policy. \n\n42 \n \nThat approach reflects a textually reasonable under-\nstanding of the statutory term \u201cdetermination,\u201d and it \nwould further the congressional policy judgments re-\nflected in the second and third prongs of Section \n7607(b)(1).  The vast majority of \u201clocally or regionally \napplicable\u201d EPA actions reflect the application of some \nnationwide agency rule, policy, or interpretation to a \nfactual setting that is confined to a single judicial cir-\ncuit.  When the circumstances suggest that the rule, pol-\nicy, or interpretation itself is likely to be called into \nquestion in any judicial challenge to the EPA action, \nrouting such challenges to the D.C. Circuit serves im-\nportant interests in judicial efficiency and nationwide \nuniformity.  That is particularly so if the relevant EPA \ndetermination is intended to govern future agency ac-\ntions.  But where the validity of the general rule or pol-\nicy appears to be settled, such that any judicial chal-\nlenges to the action are likely to focus on the application \nof the general pronouncement to discrete local facts, \nthose interests are inapposite. \nHere, EPA\u2019s new statutory interpretation and eco-\nnomic analysis were announced at roughly the same \ntime as, and were intended to guide, the denial actions \nthemselves.  Comments on the proposed denial actions \ndisputed the validity of the interpretation and analysis.  \nSee C.A. App. 96-144, 242-290 (summarizing and re-\nsponding to comments).  The interpretation and analy-\nsis therefore are properly viewed as EPA \u201cdetermina-\ntion[s]\u201d within the meaning of Section 7607(b)(1), rather \nthan as the application of settled nationwide principles \nto new factual settings.6 \n \n6  Respondents have contended (Br. in Opp. 29) that EPA\u2019s April \nand June 2022 denial actions raise distinct venue issues because the \n \n\n43 \n \niii. As explained above, a locally or regionally appli-\ncable EPA action is reviewable in the D.C. Circuit only \nif (a) the action \u201cis based on a determination of nation-\nwide scope or effect\u201d and (b) EPA \u201cfinds and publishes \nthat such action is based on such a determination.\u201d  42 \nU.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  Even when the facts and law would \nsupport the specified finding, EPA has plenary discre-\ntion to decide whether to publish that finding, and the \nagency \u201cmay weigh any number of considerations\u201d in \nmaking that decision.  Sierra Club, 47 F.4th at 746; see \np. 33, supra.  For example, EPA may consider whether \nany petitions for review of a particular action would \nlikely contest EPA determinations of national concern, \nor instead would likely dispute EPA\u2019s understanding of \nlocal or regional circumstances.  For EPA actions in the \nlatter category, the agency may decline to publish the \nrelevant finding, thereby ensuring that the regional cir-\ncuit will have venue over any challenge to the action.   \nc. The limitations described above meaningfully \nconstrain the number of locally or regionally applicable \nactions that will be subject to D.C. Circuit review, while \nfurthering the congressional purpose embodied in Sec-\ntion 7607(b)(1) to promote efficient and uniform resolu-\n \nApril denial action announced a new approach to small-refinery ex-\nemptions, while the June denial action simply applied that approach \nto additional refineries.  That contention is overstated.  Both denial \nactions here stemmed from a single proposed denial that first an-\nnounced EPA\u2019s new approach to exemptions.  Pet. App. 48a, 193a; \nsee 86 Fed. Reg. at 70,999 (proposing to \u201cdeny all pending [exemp-\ntion] petitions\u201d based on the agency\u2019s determinations regarding the \nmeaning of disproportionate economic hardship and the market re-\nalities of refinery operations).  The fact that a short time passed be-\ntween the finalization of the two actions\u2014without any court consid-\nering the validity of EPA\u2019s new determinations\u2014is an insufficient \nbasis to distinguish between the actions for purposes of venue.  \n\n44 \n \ntion of disputed issues of national significance.  By con-\ntrast, respondents\u2019 interpretation would limit D.C. Cir-\ncuit review of locally or regionally applicable EPA ac-\ntions to a vanishingly small category.  Embracing that \ninterpretation would lead to the very problems Con-\ngress sought to avoid in amending the CAA\u2019s venue pro-\nvision to include the nationwide-scope-or-effect lan-\nguage.   \nThis case is illustrative.  As a result of the Fifth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s refusal to transfer this case, EPA now faces two \nmerits decisions from two different circuit courts that \naddressed substantially similar challenges to the same \ndenial actions.  The petitioners in both circuits focused \ntheir attacks on the statutory interpretation and eco-\nnomic analysis that EPA had adopted and applied na-\ntionwide, not on any refinery-specific EPA findings.  \nAnd EPA avoided further fragmentation of judicial re-\nview only because five other regional courts of appeals \ndismissed similar challenges for improper venue or \ntransferred challenges to the D.C. Circuit.     \nAlthough both the Fifth and D.C. Circuits ultimately \nvacated EPA\u2019s denial actions, the differences in reason-\ning between the two circuits may lead to different re-\nsults on remand.7  That would create a bifurcated RFS \n \n7  Most notably, the Fifth Circuit found that refineries had reason-\nably relied on EPA\u2019s prior approach to adjudicating exemption pe-\ntitions, such that the agency\u2019s consideration of updated economic in-\nformation regarding RFS compliance costs\u2014relating to the \u201cRIN \ncost passthrough principle\u201d\u2014created an impermissible retroactive \neffect.  Pet. App. 14a; see id. at 16a-23a.  The D.C. Circuit declined \nto reach that issue.  See Sinclair Wyoming Ref. Co. v. EPA, 114 \nF.4th 693, 714 n.12 (2024) (per curiam).  Under the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \nretroactivity analysis, EPA would be required to evaluate the re-\nmanded petitions under its prior approach, without considering up-\n \n\n45 \n \nprogram consisting of one program for remanded peti-\ntions for most of the nation, and a separate, more favor-\nable program for exemption claimants in the Fifth Cir-\ncuit.  That result is contrary to Congress\u2019s direction to \nensure a uniform, nationwide framework for increasing \nrenewable fuel use, see e.g., 42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(2)(A)(i) \nand (o)(2)(B)(ii)(III), and with Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s evi-\ndent purpose of ensuring efficient, uniform resolution of \nissues with national significance.  And if this Court en-\ndorses the Fifth Circuit\u2019s venue analysis, future EPA \nactions similar to the denial actions here can be ex-\npected to spawn litigation in several courts of appeals, \nwith a consequent increased waste of judicial resources \nand a heightened risk of inconsistent outcomes.  Noth-\ning in the statutory text requires that result, and the \nCourt should reject it.   \n \n \n \ndated economic analysis of a small refinery\u2019s compliance costs be-\nyond those contemplated by the DOE study and corresponding \nscoring matrix.  That aspect of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s opinion focuses \nnot on any refinery-specific circumstance, but on the economic anal-\nysis EPA used in assessing exemption petitions from refineries na-\ntionwide.  Under the D.C. Circuit\u2019s analysis, by contrast, EPA may \nconsider any updated economic information about a small refinery\u2019s \ncompliance costs that is relevant to assessing whether the refinery \nactually suffers disproportionate economic hardship. \n\n46 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThis Court should vacate the order of the court of \nappeals and remand with instructions to transfer the \ncase to the D.C. Circuit.   \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nDIMPLE CHAUDHARY \nActing General Counsel \nSUSANNAH WEAVER \nDeputy General Counsel \nGAUTAM SRINIVASAN \nAssociate General Counsel \nMATTHEW MARKS \nDeputy Associate General \nCounsel \nSUSAN STAHLE \nJEANHEE HONG \nAttorneys \nEnvironmental Protection \nAgency \n \nELIZABETH B.

and \n \n(ii) to account for the use of renewable fuel \nduring the previous calendar year by small re-\nfineries that are exempt under paragraph (9). \n(4) Modification of greenhouse gas reduction per-\ncentages \n \n(A) \nIn general \n \nThe Administrator may, in the regulations un-\nder the last sentence of paragraph (2)(A)(i), adjust \nthe 20 percent, 50 percent, and 60 percent reduc-\ntions in lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions speci-\nfied in paragraphs (2)(A)(i) (relating to renewable \nfuel), (1)(D) (relating to biomass-based diesel), \n(1)(B)(i) (relating to advanced biofuel), and (1)(E) \n(relating to cellulosic biofuel) to a lower percent-\nage.  For the 50 and 60 percent reductions, the \nAdministrator may make such an adjustment only \nif he determines that generally such reduction is \nnot commercially feasible for fuels made using a \n\n16a \n \nvariety of feedstocks, technologies, and processes \nto meet the applicable reduction. \n \n(B) \nAmount of adjustment \n \nIn promulgating regulations under this para-\ngraph, the specified 50 percent reduction in green-\nhouse gas emissions from advanced biofuel and in \nbiomass-based diesel may not be reduced below 40 \npercent.  The specified 20 percent reduction in \ngreenhouse gas emissions from renewable fuel \nmay not be reduced below 10 percent, and the \nspecified 60 percent reduction in greenhouse gas \nemissions from cellulosic biofuel may not be re-\nduced below 50 percent. \n \n(C) \nAdjusted reduction levels \n \nAn adjustment under this paragraph to a per-\ncent less than the specified 20 percent greenhouse \ngas reduction for renewable fuel shall be the min-\nimum possible adjustment, and the adjusted \ngreenhouse gas reduction shall be established by \nthe Administrator at the maximum achievable \nlevel, taking cost in consideration, for natural gas \nfired corn-based ethanol plants, allowing for the \nuse of a variety of technologies and processes.  \nAn adjustment in the 50 or 60 percent greenhouse \ngas levels shall be the minimum possible adjust-\nment for the fuel or fuels concerned, and the ad-\njusted greenhouse gas reduction shall be estab-\nlished at the maximum achievable level, taking \ncost in consideration, allowing for the use of a va-\nriety of feedstocks, technologies, and processes. \n \n \n \n \n\n17a \n \n \n(D) \n5-year review \n \nWhenever the Administrator makes any ad-\njustment under this paragraph, not later than 5 \nyears thereafter he shall review and revise (based \nupon the same criteria and standards as required \nfor the initial adjustment) the regulations estab-\nlishing the adjusted level. \n \n(E) \nSubsequent adjustments \n \nAfter the Administrator has promulgated a fi-\nnal rule under the last sentence of paragraph \n(2)(A)(i) with respect to the method of determin-\ning lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions, except as \nprovided in subparagraph (D), the Administrator \nmay not adjust the percent greenhouse gas reduc-\ntion levels unless he determines that there has \nbeen a significant change in the analytical meth-\nodology used for determining the lifecycle green-\nhouse gas emissions.  If he makes such determi-\nnation, he may adjust the 20, 50, or 60 percent re-\nduction levels through rulemaking using the crite-\nria and standards set forth in this paragraph. \n \n(F) \nLimit on upward adjustments \n \nIf, under subparagraph (D) or (E), the Admin-\nistrator revises a percent level adjusted as pro-\nvided in subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) to a \nhigher percent, such higher percent may not ex-\nceed the applicable percent specified in paragraph \n(2)(A)(i), (1)(D), (1)(B)(i), or (1)(E). \n \n(G) \nApplicability of adjustments \n \nIf the Administrator adjusts, or revises, a per-\ncent level referred to in this paragraph or makes \n\n18a \n \na change in the analytical methodology used for \ndetermining the lifecycle greenhouse gas emis-\nsions, such adjustment, revision, or change (or any \ncombination thereof\u200a) shall only apply to renewa-\nble fuel from new facilities that commence con-\nstruction after the effective date of such adjust-\nment, revision, or change. \n(5) Credit program \n \n(A) \nIn general \n \nThe regulations promulgated under paragraph \n(2)(A) shall provide\u2014 \n \n(i) \nfor the generation of an appropriate \namount of credits by any person that refines, \nblends, or imports gasoline that contains a \nquantity of renewable fuel that is greater than \nthe quantity required under paragraph (2); \n \n(ii) for the generation of an appropriate \namount of credits for biodiesel; and \n \n(iii) for the generation of credits by small \nrefineries in accordance with paragraph (9)(C). \n \n(B) \nUse of credits \n \nA person that generates credits under subpar-\nagraph (A) may use the credits, or transfer all or \na portion of the credits to another person, for the \npurpose of complying with paragraph (2). \n \n(C) \nDuration of credits \n \nA credit generated under this paragraph shall \nbe valid to show compliance for the 12 months as \nof the date of generation. \n\n19a \n \n \n(D) \nInability to generate or purchase sufficient \ncredits \n \nThe regulations promulgated under paragraph \n(2)(A) shall include provisions allowing any person \nthat is unable to generate or purchase sufficient \ncredits to meet the requirements of paragraph (2) \nto carry forward a renewable fuel deficit on condi-\ntion that the person, in the calendar year following \nthe year in which the renewable fuel deficit is  \ncreated\u2014 \n \n(i) \nachieves compliance with the renewa-\nble fuel requirement under paragraph (2); and \n \n(ii) generates or purchases additional re-\nnewable fuel credits to offset the renewable \nfuel deficit of the previous year. \n \n(E) \nCredits for additional renewable fuel \n \nThe Administrator may issue regulations \nproviding:  (i) for the generation of an appropri-\nate amount of credits by any person that refines, \nblends, or imports additional renewable fuels \nspecified by the Administrator; and (ii) for the use \nof such credits by the generator, or the transfer of \nall or a portion of the credits to another person, \nfor the purpose of complying with paragraph (2). \n(6) Seasonal variations in renewable fuel use \n \n(A) \nStudy \n \nFor each of calendar years 2006 through 2012, \nthe Administrator of the Energy Information Ad-\nministration shall conduct a study of renewable \nfuel blending to determine whether there are ex-\n\n20a \n \ncessive seasonal variations in the use of renewable \nfuel. \n \n(B) \nRegulation of excessive seasonal variations \n \nIf, for any calendar year, the Administrator of \nthe Energy Information Administration, based on \nthe study under subparagraph (A), makes the de-\nterminations specified in subparagraph (C), the \nAdministrator of the Environmental Protection \nAgency shall promulgate regulations to ensure \nthat 25 percent or more of the quantity of renew-\nable fuel necessary to meet the requirements of \nparagraph (2) is used during each of the 2 periods \nspecified in subparagraph (D) of each subsequent \ncalendar year. \n \n(C) \nDeterminations \n \nThe determinations referred to in subpara-\ngraph (B) are that\u2014 \n \n(i) \nless than 25 percent of the quantity of \nrenewable fuel necessary to meet the require-\nments of paragraph (2) has been used during 1 \nof the 2 periods specified in subparagraph (D) \nof the calendar year; \n \n(ii) a pattern of excessive seasonal varia-\ntion described in clause (i) will continue in sub-\nsequent calendar years; and \n \n(iii) promulgating regulations or other re-\nquirements to impose a 25 percent or more sea-\nsonal use of renewable fuels will not prevent or \ninterfere with the attainment of national ambi-\nent air quality standards or significantly in-\ncrease the price of motor fuels to the consumer. \n\n21a \n \n \n(D) \nPeriods \n \nThe 2 periods referred to in this paragraph \nare\u2014 \n \n \n \n(i) \nApril through September; and \n \n(ii) January through March and October \nthrough December. \n \n(E) \nExclusion \n \nRenewable fuel blended or consumed in calen-\ndar year 2006 in a State that has received a waiver \nunder section 7543(b) of this title shall not be in-\ncluded in the study under subparagraph (A). \n \n(F) \nState exemption from seasonality require-\nments \n \nNotwithstanding any other provision of law, \nthe seasonality requirement relating to renewable \nfuel use established by this paragraph shall not \napply to any State that has received a waiver un-\nder section 7543(b) of this title or any State de-\npendent on refineries in such State for gasoline \nsupplies. \n(7) Waivers \n \n(A) \nIn general \n \nThe Administrator, in consultation with the \nSecretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of En-\nergy, may waive the requirements of paragraph \n(2) in whole or in part on petition by one or more \nStates, by any person subject to the requirements \nof this subsection, or by the Administrator on his \nown motion by reducing the national quantity of \nrenewable fuel required under paragraph (2)\u2014 \n\n22a \n \n \n(i) \nbased on a determination by the Ad-\nministrator, after public notice and opportunity \nfor comment, that implementation of the re-\nquirement would severely harm the economy \nor environment of a State, a region, or the \nUnited States; or \n \n(ii) based on a determination by the Ad-\nministrator, after public notice and opportunity \nfor comment, that there is an inadequate do-\nmestic supply. \n \n(B) \nPetitions for waivers \n \nThe Administrator, in consultation with the \nSecretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of En-\nergy, shall approve or disapprove a petition for a \nwaiver of the requirements of paragraph (2) \nwithin 90 days after the date on which the petition \nis received by the Administrator. \n \n(C) \nTermination of waivers \n \nA waiver granted under subparagraph (A) shall \nterminate after 1 year, but may be renewed by the \nAdministrator after consultation with the Secre-\ntary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Energy. \n \n(D) \nCellulosic biofuel \n \n(i) \nFor any calendar year for which the pro-\njected volume of cellulosic biofuel production is \nless than the minimum applicable volume estab-\nlished under paragraph (2)(B), as determined by \nthe Administrator based on the estimate provided \nunder paragraph (3)(A), not later than November \n30 of the preceding calendar year, the Administra-\ntor shall reduce the applicable volume of cellulosic \n\n23a \n \nbiofuel required under paragraph (2)(B) to the \nprojected volume available during that calendar \nyear.  For any calendar year in which the Admin-\nistrator makes such a reduction, the Administra-\ntor may also reduce the applicable volume of re-\nnewable fuel and advanced biofuels requirement \nestablished under paragraph (2)(B) by the same or \na lesser volume. \n \n(ii) Whenever the Administrator reduces the \nminimum cellulosic biofuel volume under this sub-\nparagraph, the Administrator shall make availa-\nble for sale cellulosic biofuel credits at the higher \nof $0.25 per gallon or the amount by which $3.00 \nper gallon exceeds the average wholesale price of \na gallon of gasoline in the United States.  Such \namounts shall be adjusted for inflation by the Ad-\nministrator for years after 2008. \n \n(iii) Eighteen months after December 19, 2007, \nthe Administrator shall promulgate regulations to \ngovern the issuance of credits under this subpara-\ngraph.  The regulations shall set forth the \nmethod for determining the exact price of credits \nin the event of a waiver.  The price of such credits \nshall not be changed more frequently than once \neach quarter.  These regulations shall include \nsuch provisions, including limiting the credits\u2019 \nuses and useful life, as the Administrator deems \nappropriate to assist market liquidity and trans-\nparency, to provide appropriate certainty for reg-\nulated entities and renewable fuel producers, and \nto limit any potential misuse of cellulosic biofuel \ncredits to reduce the use of other renewable fuels, \nand for such other purposes as the Administrator \n\n24a \n \ndetermines will help achieve the goals of this sub-\nsection.  The regulations shall limit the number \nof cellulosic biofuel credits for any calendar year \nto the minimum applicable volume (as reduced un-\nder this subparagraph) of cellulosic biofuel for \nthat year. \n \n(E) \nBiomass-based diesel \n \n \n(i) \nMarket evaluation \n \nThe Administrator, in consultation with the \nSecretary of Energy and the Secretary of Ag-\nriculture, shall periodically evaluate the impact \nof the biomass-based diesel requirements es-\ntablished under this paragraph on the price of \ndiesel fuel. \n \n \n(ii) \nWaiver \n \nIf the Administrator determines that there \nis a significant renewable feedstock disruption \nor other market circumstances that would \nmake the price of biomass-based diesel fuel in-\ncrease significantly, the Administrator, in con-\nsultation with the Secretary of Energy and the \nSecretary of Agriculture, shall issue an order \nto reduce, for up to a 60-day period, the quan-\ntity of biomass-based diesel required under \nsubparagraph (A) by an appropriate quantity \nthat does not exceed 15 percent of the applica-\nble annual requirement for biomass-based die-\nsel.  For any calendar year in which the Ad-\nministrator makes a reduction under this sub-\nparagraph, the Administrator may also reduce \nthe applicable volume of renewable fuel and ad-\nvanced biofuels requirement established under \n\n25a \n \nparagraph (2)(B) by the same or a lesser vol-\nume. \n \n \n(iii) Extensions \n \nIf the Administrator determines that the \nfeedstock disruption or circumstances de-\nscribed in clause (ii) is continuing beyond the \n60-day period described in clause (ii) or this \nclause, the Administrator, in consultation with \nthe Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of \nAgriculture, may issue an order to reduce, for \nup to an additional 60-day period, the quantity \nof biomass-based diesel required under sub-\nparagraph (A) by an appropriate quantity that \ndoes not exceed an additional 15 percent of the \napplicable annual requirement for biomass-\nbased diesel. \n \n(F) \nModification of applicable volumes \n \nFor any of the tables in paragraph (2)(B), if the \nAdministrator waives\u2014 \n \n(i) \nat least 20 percent of the applicable vol-\nume requirement set forth in any such table for \n2 consecutive years; or \n \n(ii) at least 50 percent of such volume re-\nquirement for a single year, \nthe Administrator shall promulgate a rule (within \n1 year after issuing such waiver) that modifies the \napplicable volumes set forth in the table con-\ncerned for all years following the final year to \nwhich the waiver applies, except that no such mod-\nification in applicable volumes shall be made for \nany year before 2016.  In promulgating such a \n\n26a \n \nrule, the Administrator shall comply with the pro-\ncesses, criteria, and standards set forth in para-\ngraph (2)(B)(ii). \n(8) Study and waiver for initial year of program \n \n(A) \nIn general \n \nNot later than 180 days after August 8, 2005, \nthe Secretary of Energy shall conduct for the Ad-\nministrator a study assessing whether the renew-\nable fuel requirement under paragraph (2) will \nlikely result in significant adverse impacts on con-\nsumers in 2006, on a national, regional, or State \nbasis. \n \n(B) \nRequired evaluations \n \n \nThe study shall evaluate renewable fuel\u2014 \n \n \n \n(i) \nsupplies and prices; \n \n \n \n(ii) blendstock supplies; and \n \n(iii) supply and distribution system capabil-\nities. \n \n(C) \nRecommendations by the Secretary \n \nBased on the results of the study, the Secretary \nof Energy shall make specific recommendations to \nthe Administrator concerning waiver of the re-\nquirements of paragraph (2), in whole or in part, \nto prevent any adverse impacts described in sub-\nparagraph (A). \n \n(D) \nWaiver \n \n \n(i) \nIn general \n \nNot later than 270 days after August 8, 2005, \nthe Administrator shall, if and to the extent \n\n27a \n \nrecommended by the Secretary of Energy un-\nder subparagraph (C), waive, in whole or in \npart, the renewable fuel requirement under \nparagraph (2) by reducing the national quan-\ntity of renewable fuel required under para-\ngraph (2) in calendar year 2006. \n \n \n(ii) \nNo effect on waiver authority \n \nClause (i) does not limit the authority of the \nAdministrator to waive the requirements of \nparagraph (2) in whole, or in part, under para-\ngraph (7). \n(9) Small refineries \n \n(A) \nTemporary exemption \n \n \n(i) \nIn general \n \nThe requirements of paragraph (2) shall not \napply to small refineries until calendar year \n2011. \n \n \n(ii) \nExtension of exemption \n \n \n \n(I) \nStudy by Secretary of Energy \n \nNot later than December 31, 2008, the \nSecretary of Energy shall conduct for the \nAdministrator a study to determine whether \ncompliance with the requirements of para-\ngraph (2) would impose a disproportionate \neconomic hardship on small refineries. \n \n \n \n(II) \nExtension of exemption \n \nIn the case of a small refinery that the \nSecretary of Energy determines under sub-\nclause (I) would be subject to a dispropor-\n\n28a \n \ntionate economic hardship if required to \ncomply with paragraph (2), the Administra-\ntor shall extend the exemption under clause \n(i) for the small refinery for a period of not \nless than 2 additional years. \n \n(B) \nPetitions based on disproportionate eco-\nnomic hardship \n \n \n(i) \nExtension of exemption \n \nA small refinery may at any time petition \nthe Administrator for an extension of the ex-\nemption under subparagraph (A) for the reason \nof disproportionate economic hardship. \n \n \n(ii) \nEvaluation of petitions \n \nIn evaluating a petition under clause (i), the \nAdministrator, in consultation with the Secre-\ntary of Energy, shall consider the findings of \nthe study under subparagraph (A)(ii) and other \neconomic factors. \n \n \n(iii) Deadline for action on petitions \n \nThe Administrator shall act on any petition \nsubmitted by a small refinery for a hardship ex-\nemption not later than 90 days after the date of \nreceipt of the petition. \n \n(C) \nCredit program \n \nIf a small refinery notifies the Administrator \nthat the small refinery waives the exemption un-\nder subparagraph (A), the regulations promul-\ngated under paragraph (2)(A) shall provide for the \ngeneration of credits by the small refinery under \n\n29a \n \nparagraph (5) beginning in the calendar year fol-\nlowing the date of notification. \n \n(D) \nOpt-in for small refineries \n \nA small refinery shall be subject to the require-\nments of paragraph (2) if the small refinery noti-\nfies the Administrator that the small refinery \nwaives the exemption under subparagraph (A). \n(10) Ethanol market concentration analysis \n \n(A) \nAnalysis \n \n \n(i) \nIn general \n \nNot later than 180 days after August 8, 2005, \nand annually thereafter, the Federal Trade \nCommission shall perform a market concentra-\ntion analysis of the ethanol production industry \nusing the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index to de-\ntermine whether there is sufficient competition \namong industry participants to avoid price- \nsetting and other anticompetitive behavior. \n \n \n(ii) \nScoring \n \nFor the purpose of scoring under clause (i) \nusing the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, all \nmarketing arrangements among industry par-\nticipants shall be considered. \n \n(B) \nReport \n \nNot later than December 1, 2005, and annually \nthereafter, the Federal Trade Commission shall \nsubmit to Congress and the Administrator a re-\nport on the results of the market concentration \nanalysis performed under subparagraph (A)(i). \n\n30a \n \n(11) Periodic reviews \n \nTo allow for the appropriate adjustment of the re-\nquirements described in subparagraph (B) of para-\ngraph (2), the Administrator shall conduct periodic \nreviews of\u2014 \n \n \n(A) \nexisting technologies;

Main Street, Suite 201\nMadison, WI 53703 \n \n\n \nQUESTION PRESENTED \nThe Clean Air Act requires the Environmental Protec-\ntion Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) to grant an exemption from the Act\u2019s \nRenewable Fuel Standard (\u201cRFS\u201d) to a small refinery \nwhen compliance with the RFS would cause the refinery \ndisproportionate economic hardship in a given year.  \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(i). The six small refinery re-\nspondents here separately petitioned EPA for hardship \nexemptions for particular compliance years. EPA con-\ncluded, after \u201cconsider[ing] each [respondent\u2019s] individual \nrefinery information,\u201d that each of the respondents was \nnot entitled to hardship relief and denied the petitions. \nPet.App.14a-15a. Respondents then petitioned for judicial \nreview as permitted by the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1). The question presented is:  \nWhether an EPA decision denying a small refinery\u2019s \nRFS hardship petition is a \u201clocally or regionally applica-\nble\u201d action, such that a court challenge to that action is \nproperly venued in a regional circuit court, or is instead a \n\u201cnationally applicable\u201d action or an action \u201cbased on a  \ndetermination of nationwide scope or effect\u201d that must be \nchallenged only in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. \nCircuit. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). \n \n \n\n \nii \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nStatutory Provision Involved ............................................. 1 \nIntroduction ......................................................................... 3 \nStatement ............................................................................. 6 \nA.

App.1a-31a, infra. \n \n \n\n \n3 \nINTRODUCTION \nThe Clean Air Act (\u201cCAA\u201d or \u201cAct\u201d) assigns the venue \nfor a petition for judicial review of final agency action by \nasking whether the challenged action is \u201cnationally appli-\ncable\u201d (reviewed by the D.C. Circuit) or \u201clocally or region-\nally applicable\u201d (reviewed by the regional circuit courts). \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1).1 Determining venue thus requires \nfocusing with precision on the \u201caction\u201d that the Environ-\nmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) was authorized by the \nCAA to take: the \u201cfinal action taken \u2026 under this chap-\nter.\u201d Ibid. (\u201c[T]his chapter\u201d is the CAA.) \nOnce the final action is properly identified, the venue \nprovision is straightforward. Most EPA actions under the \nAct are rulemakings or similar actions that apply through-\nout the entire nation, or else are adjudications or similar \ndecisions involving individual States or regulated entities. \nThe former go to the D.C. Circuit, the latter to the re-\ngional circuit courts\u2014save only in the exceptional circum-\nstance where the CAA\u2019s text directs EPA to base a local \naction on a \u201cdetermination\u201d about the whole nation. \nApplying those statutory instructions here shows why \nthe Fifth Circuit below got the venue question right. This \ncase concerns a type of statutory forbearance from the \nCAA\u2019s Renewable Fuel Standard (\u201cRFS\u201d) that affects \nonly small refineries. Small refineries like respondents \nmay petition EPA for an exemption from the RFS obliga-\ntion by showing that they will face disproportionate eco-\nnomic hardship from compliance with the RFS in a given \nyear. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(A)-(B). Until a presidential administra-\ntion change in 2021, EPA had repeatedly acknowledged \nthat its decisions on small refineries\u2019 hardship petitions \n \n1  All statutory citations are to Title 42 of the United States \nCode. \n\n \n4 \nare quintessential locally applicable actions that Section \n7607(b)(1) refers to the regional circuits. That\u2019s because \neach EPA \u201cfinal action\u201d on a hardship-exemption petition \nadjudicates the rights of only one small refinery located in \none place, and the \u201cchapter\u201d (the CAA) requires those ac-\ntions to be based on consideration of each small refinery\u2019s \nown economic hardship. \u00a7 7607(b)(1); see \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B). \nEPA changed its position on venue and started delib-\nerately attempting to re-direct judicial challenges to its \npreferred court, the D.C. Circuit, only after it suffered a \nstring of defeats in regional circuit courts that found EPA \nhad wrongly decided hardship petitions. EPA now argues \nthat, because it published its decisions on multiple small \nrefineries\u2019 pending hardship petitions bundled together in \ntwo explanation documents (denying every pending peti-\ntion), it was able to convert what it has long agreed were \nlocally applicable final actions into just two nationally  \napplicable actions. EPA was transparent about its goal of \nmaking the D.C. Circuit the only court allowed to review \nits latest denial decisions. \nEPA\u2019s new venue position is contrary to the CAA\u2019s \ntext, and the Fifth Circuit correctly rejected it. EPA was \nable to produce the bundled decisions only by ignoring the \nstatutory command to decide hardship petitions individu-\nally as they come in. More fundamentally, the two expla-\nnation documents were bundles of individual final actions \nunder the CAA. EPA\u2019s choice about how to publish its  \ndecisions cannot change the nature of the \u201cfinal action \ntaken \u2026 under this chapter,\u201d which is what matters for \nvenue. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). It is the statutory text\u2014\u201cth[e] chap-\nter\u201d\u2014that establishes what actions EPA is permitted to \ntake. And here, every relevant provision of the chapter \nconfirms that EPA was required to produce individualized \n\n \n5 \nfinal actions based on individual petitioning refineries\u2019 \neconomic circumstances.  \nIn fact, that is just what EPA did. EPA itself has \nstated that it denied all of the small-refinery respondents\u2019 \nRFS hardship petitions because it \u201cdetermin[ed],\u201d after \n\u201cconsider[ing] each [refinery\u2019s] individual refinery infor-\nmation,\u201d that each respondent was not experiencing dis-\nproportionate economic hardship. Pet.App.14a-15a. EPA \nconcluded, after examining each respondent\u2019s evidence, \nthat each ostensibly passes on 100% of its RFS compliance \ncosts in the price of the fuel it sells. Those were the con-\nclusions on which EPA based its decisions to deny hard-\nship relief to these small-refinery respondents, each of \nwhich received an individualized explanation from EPA \nanalyzing its own economic evidence. \nMultiple courts of appeals (including the D.C. Circuit) \nhave since held that EPA\u2019s merits reasoning about the \nsmall refineries\u2019 ability to pass through their RFS compli-\nance costs was arbitrary and capricious and unsupported \nby the record evidence. But the venue issue before this \nCourt is simpler. To borrow Judge Silberman\u2019s descrip-\ntion of the venue provision that EPA endorses (U.S. Br. \n18): EPA\u2019s answer to whether a petitioning small refinery \nlike Calumet Shreveport located in Shreveport, Louisi-\nana, does or does not successfully pass through its RFS \ncompliance costs in its fuel sales hardly qualifies as a \u201creg-\nulatory issue[ ] of national importance\u201d that belongs in the \nD.C. Circuit. National Env\u2019t Dev. Ass\u2019ns Clean Air Pro-\nject v. EPA, 891 F.3d. 1041, 1054 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (Silber-\nman, J., concurring). \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment should be affirmed. \n\n \n6 \nSTATEMENT \nA. Statutory and regulatory background \n1. Venue for petitions for review under the Clean \nAir Act \nSection 7607(b)(1) governs \u201c[j]udicial review\u201d of \u201cpeti-\ntions for review\u201d of EPA\u2019s \u201cfinal action[s] under this chap-\nter,\u201d i.e., under the Clean Air Act. See Kentucky v. EPA, \n123 F.4th 447, 458, 461 (6th Cir. 2024); 42 U.S.C. Ch. 85, \nCodification Note (\u201cthis chapter\u201d is the CAA). As relevant \nhere, Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s venue instructions consist of \nthree \u201clengthy\u201d sentences. Kentucky, 123 F.4th at 458.  \na. The first sentence describes the proper venue for \nchallenging EPA final actions that apply to the nation as \na whole. That sentence begins by enumerating several \nCAA provisions authorizing EPA to take national actions. \nFor example, when EPA promulgates a national primary \nor secondary air quality standard under Section 7412, or \nsets a standard of performance for all new stationary \nsources of emissions under Section 7411, challenges to \nthose national actions \u201cmay be filed only in\u201d the D.C. Cir-\ncuit. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). In 1977, Congress amended the venue \nprovision to add a catchall phrase to that sentence: In  \naddition to the enumerated national actions, \u201cany other \nnationally applicable regulations promulgated, or final  \naction taken, by the Administrator under this chapter\u201d \nare reviewable only in the D.C. Circuit. Ibid.; see Clean \nAir Act Amendments of 1977, Pub. L. No. 95-95, 91 Stat. \n685 (Aug. 7, 1977).2 \n \n \n2  For ease of reference, the 1970 and 1982 versions of the \nvenue provision (the latter including the 1977 amendments) are \nprovided at App., infra, 29a and 30a, respectively. \n\n \n7 \nb. The second sentence follows the same basic struc-\nture but for non-national final agency actions. It first enu-\nmerates CAA provisions authorizing EPA to take actions \nthat apply to less than the whole country, and it makes \nthose actions reviewable only in regional circuit courts. \nFor example, when EPA approves or promulgates a state \nimplementation plan under Sections 7410 or 7411(d), a \nchallenge to that action \u201cmay be filed only in the United \nStates Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit.\u201d \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1). The second sentence of Section 7607(b)(1), \nlike the first, also includes a catchall phrase added by the \nsame 1977 amendment: \u201cany other final action of the  \nAdministrator under this chapter \u2026 which is locally or  \nregionally applicable\u201d is reviewable only in \u201cthe appropri-\nate circuit\u201d court. Ibid.  \nIdentifying which circuit court is \u201cappropriate\u201d for  \nreviewing local or regional final action is usually easy. \nThat\u2019s because for these EPA actions, the relevant sub-\nstantive CAA provision makes it clear that the action  \naffects particular regulated facilities or States, each of \nwhich is governed by a regional circuit court. When EPA \npromulgates a regional action that happens to touch more \nthan one federal circuit\u2014for example, approving or re-\njecting an implementation plan for the Metropolitan Kan-\nsas City air-quality-control region\u2014there may be more \nthan one appropriate circuit. \nc. The courts of appeals and EPA agree that, to  \nassess the national vs. local applicability of an EPA action \nfor purposes of Section 7607(b)(1), courts look only \u201cto the \nface\u201d of the action as that action is authorized by the \nCAA\u2014not to the challenger\u2019s arguments in the petition \nfor review, and not to the effects of the action or the rea-\nsoning within it. American Rd. & Transp. Builders Ass\u2019n \nv. EPA, 705 F.3d 453, 456 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (Kavanaugh, \n\n \n8 \nJ.); see also, e.g., ATK Launch Sys., Inc. v. EPA, 651 F.3d \n1194, 1197 (10th Cir. 2011); U.S. Br. 20 (invoking \u201cthe face \nof \u201d the actions). That focus on what action EPA took fol-\nlows from the statutory instruction to look to the \u201cfinal ac-\ntion \u2026 under this chapter\u201d to resolve venue. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). \nThe textual structure of Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s first two \nsentences\u2014enumerated lists of CAA actions followed by \ncatchall phrases\u2014indicates that courts should apply the \ncatchall phrases by reasoning by analogy to the enumer-\nated provisions. The catchall phrases use a \u201ccollective \nterm\u201d\u2014any other final action\u2014\u201cat the end of a list of spe-\ncific items,\u201d so the collective term is \u201ccontrolled and  \ndefined by reference to the specific classes that precede \nit.\u201d Fischer v. United States, 603 U.S. 480, 487 (2024) \n(ejusdem generis canon) (cleaned up); see Kentucky, 123 \nF.4th at 460 (using ejusdem generis to interpret Section \n7607(b)(1)). Thus, an EPA final action pursuant to an  \nunenumerated CAA provision is \u201cnationally applicable\u201d if \nit applies to the whole nation like the enumerated actions \nin the first sentence of Section 7607(b)(1) do. And a final  \naction is \u201clocally or regionally applicable\u201d if it applies to \nless than the whole nation, as the enumerated CAA  \nactions in the second sentence do. Ibid. \nd. The third sentence contemplates a narrow excep-\ntion for certain rare EPA actions that, though locally or \nregionally applicable, are \u201cbased on a determination of  \nnationwide scope or effect.\u201d \u00a7 7607(b)(1). That sentence \nwas added by the same 1977 amendment referenced \nabove, prompted by a recommendation from the Adminis-\ntrative Conference of the United States that included a \nstatement from EPA General Counsel William Frick. See \n41 Fed. Reg. 56,767 (Dec. 30, 1976).  \nFrick had identified a circumstance where the third-\nsentence exception was needed. 41 Fed. Reg. at 56,768-\n\n \n9 \n56,769. Under a particular CAA provision at the time \n(since repealed), EPA could grant extensions of a State\u2019s \nattainment date for certain national ambient air quality \nstandards\u2014actions that were locally applicable\u2014only \u201cif \nafter review ... the Administrator determine[d] that,\u201d \namong other things, regulated emission sources were  \n\u201cunable to comply with the [applicable] requirements \u2026 \nbecause the necessary technology or other alternatives \nare not available or will not be available soon enough to \npermit compliance.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857c-5(e) (1973) (empha-\nsis added); see NRDC v. EPA, 475 F.2d 968 (D.C. Cir. \n1973) (explaining the available-technology determination \nand corresponding extension action). \nFrick\u2019s statement, which the government agrees (U.S. \nBr. 37) was the genesis of the third sentence in Sec-\ntion 7607(b)(1), illustrates how that exception works: If \nthe statutory text requires a particular EPA action to \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Main Street, Suite 201\nMadison, WI 53703 \n \n\n \nQUESTION PRESENTED \nThe Clean Air Act requires the Environmental Protec-\ntion Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) to grant an exemption from the Act\u2019s \nRenewable Fuel Standard (\u201cRFS\u201d) to a small refinery \nwhen compliance with the RFS would cause the refinery \ndisproportionate economic hardship in a given year.  \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(i). The six small refinery re-\nspondents here separately petitioned EPA for hardship \nexemptions for particular compliance years. EPA con-\ncluded, after \u201cconsider[ing] each [respondent\u2019s] individual \nrefinery information,\u201d that each of the respondents was \nnot entitled to hardship relief and denied the petitions. \nPet.App.14a-15a. Respondents then petitioned for judicial \nreview as permitted by the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1). The question presented is:  \nWhether an EPA decision denying a small refinery\u2019s \nRFS hardship petition is a \u201clocally or regionally applica-\nble\u201d action, such that a court challenge to that action is \nproperly venued in a regional circuit court, or is instead a \n\u201cnationally applicable\u201d action or an action \u201cbased on a  \ndetermination of nationwide scope or effect\u201d that must be \nchallenged only in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. \nCircuit. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). \n \n \n\n \nii \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nStatutory Provision Involved ............................................. 1 \nIntroduction ......................................................................... 3 \nStatement ............................................................................. 6 \nA.

A petition for review of the Administrator\u2019s  \naction in approving or promulgating any implementation \nplan under section 7410 of this title or section 7411(d) of \nthis title, any order under section 7411(j) of this title,  \nunder section 7412 of this title, under section 7419 of this \ntitle, or under section 7420 of this title, or his action under \nsection 1857c-10(c)(2)(A), (B), or (C) of this title (as in  \neffect before August 7, 1977) or under regulations there-\nunder, or revising regulations for enhanced monitoring \nand compliance certification programs under section \n7414(a)(3) of this title, or any other final action of the  \nAdministrator under this chapter (including any denial or \ndisapproval by the Administrator under subchapter I) \nwhich is locally or regionally applicable may be filed only \nin the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate \ncircuit. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence a petition \nfor review of any action referred to in such sentence may \nbe filed only in the United States Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia if such action is based on a determi-\nnation of nationwide scope or effect and if in taking such \naction the Administrator finds and publishes that such  \naction is based on such a determination. \n* \nThis and other pertinent statutory provisions are  \nreprinted in the appendix to this brief. App.1a-31a, infra. \n \n \n\n \n3 \nINTRODUCTION \nThe Clean Air Act (\u201cCAA\u201d or \u201cAct\u201d) assigns the venue \nfor a petition for judicial review of final agency action by \nasking whether the challenged action is \u201cnationally appli-\ncable\u201d (reviewed by the D.C. Circuit) or \u201clocally or region-\nally applicable\u201d (reviewed by the regional circuit courts). \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1).1 Determining venue thus requires \nfocusing with precision on the \u201caction\u201d that the Environ-\nmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) was authorized by the \nCAA to take: the \u201cfinal action taken \u2026 under this chap-\nter.\u201d Ibid. (\u201c[T]his chapter\u201d is the CAA.) \nOnce the final action is properly identified, the venue \nprovision is straightforward. Most EPA actions under the \nAct are rulemakings or similar actions that apply through-\nout the entire nation, or else are adjudications or similar \ndecisions involving individual States or regulated entities. \nThe former go to the D.C. Circuit, the latter to the re-\ngional circuit courts\u2014save only in the exceptional circum-\nstance where the CAA\u2019s text directs EPA to base a local \naction on a \u201cdetermination\u201d about the whole nation. \nApplying those statutory instructions here shows why \nthe Fifth Circuit below got the venue question right. This \ncase concerns a type of statutory forbearance from the \nCAA\u2019s Renewable Fuel Standard (\u201cRFS\u201d) that affects \nonly small refineries. Small refineries like respondents \nmay petition EPA for an exemption from the RFS obliga-\ntion by showing that they will face disproportionate eco-\nnomic hardship from compliance with the RFS in a given \nyear. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(A)-(B). Until a presidential administra-\ntion change in 2021, EPA had repeatedly acknowledged \nthat its decisions on small refineries\u2019 hardship petitions \n \n1  All statutory citations are to Title 42 of the United States \nCode. \n\n \n4 \nare quintessential locally applicable actions that Section \n7607(b)(1) refers to the regional circuits. That\u2019s because \neach EPA \u201cfinal action\u201d on a hardship-exemption petition \nadjudicates the rights of only one small refinery located in \none place, and the \u201cchapter\u201d (the CAA) requires those ac-\ntions to be based on consideration of each small refinery\u2019s \nown economic hardship. \u00a7 7607(b)(1); see \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B). \nEPA changed its position on venue and started delib-\nerately attempting to re-direct judicial challenges to its \npreferred court, the D.C. Circuit, only after it suffered a \nstring of defeats in regional circuit courts that found EPA \nhad wrongly decided hardship petitions. EPA now argues \nthat, because it published its decisions on multiple small \nrefineries\u2019 pending hardship petitions bundled together in \ntwo explanation documents (denying every pending peti-\ntion), it was able to convert what it has long agreed were \nlocally applicable final actions into just two nationally  \napplicable actions. EPA was transparent about its goal of \nmaking the D.C. Circuit the only court allowed to review \nits latest denial decisions. \nEPA\u2019s new venue position is contrary to the CAA\u2019s \ntext, and the Fifth Circuit correctly rejected it. EPA was \nable to produce the bundled decisions only by ignoring the \nstatutory command to decide hardship petitions individu-\nally as they come in. More fundamentally, the two expla-\nnation documents were bundles of individual final actions \nunder the CAA. EPA\u2019s choice about how to publish its  \ndecisions cannot change the nature of the \u201cfinal action \ntaken \u2026 under this chapter,\u201d which is what matters for \nvenue. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). It is the statutory text\u2014\u201cth[e] chap-\nter\u201d\u2014that establishes what actions EPA is permitted to \ntake. And here, every relevant provision of the chapter \nconfirms that EPA was required to produce individualized \n\n \n5 \nfinal actions based on individual petitioning refineries\u2019 \neconomic circumstances.  \nIn fact, that is just what EPA did. EPA itself has \nstated that it denied all of the small-refinery respondents\u2019 \nRFS hardship petitions because it \u201cdetermin[ed],\u201d after \n\u201cconsider[ing] each [refinery\u2019s] individual refinery infor-\nmation,\u201d that each respondent was not experiencing dis-\nproportionate economic hardship. Pet.App.14a-15a. EPA \nconcluded, after examining each respondent\u2019s evidence, \nthat each ostensibly passes on 100% of its RFS compliance \ncosts in the price of the fuel it sells. Those were the con-\nclusions on which EPA based its decisions to deny hard-\nship relief to these small-refinery respondents, each of \nwhich received an individualized explanation from EPA \nanalyzing its own economic evidence. \nMultiple courts of appeals (including the D.C. Circuit) \nhave since held that EPA\u2019s merits reasoning about the \nsmall refineries\u2019 ability to pass through their RFS compli-\nance costs was arbitrary and capricious and unsupported \nby the record evidence. But the venue issue before this \nCourt is simpler. To borrow Judge Silberman\u2019s descrip-\ntion of the venue provision that EPA endorses (U.S. Br. \n18): EPA\u2019s answer to whether a petitioning small refinery \nlike Calumet Shreveport located in Shreveport, Louisi-\nana, does or does not successfully pass through its RFS \ncompliance costs in its fuel sales hardly qualifies as a \u201creg-\nulatory issue[ ] of national importance\u201d that belongs in the \nD.C. Circuit. National Env\u2019t Dev. Ass\u2019ns Clean Air Pro-\nject v. EPA, 891 F.3d. 1041, 1054 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (Silber-\nman, J., concurring). \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment should be affirmed. \n\n \n6 \nSTATEMENT \nA. Statutory and regulatory background \n1. Venue for petitions for review under the Clean \nAir Act \nSection 7607(b)(1) governs \u201c[j]udicial review\u201d of \u201cpeti-\ntions for review\u201d of EPA\u2019s \u201cfinal action[s] under this chap-\nter,\u201d i.e., under the Clean Air Act. See Kentucky v. EPA, \n123 F.4th 447, 458, 461 (6th Cir. 2024); 42 U.S.C. Ch. 85, \nCodification Note (\u201cthis chapter\u201d is the CAA). As relevant \nhere, Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s venue instructions consist of \nthree \u201clengthy\u201d sentences. Kentucky, 123 F.4th at 458.  \na. The first sentence describes the proper venue for \nchallenging EPA final actions that apply to the nation as \na whole. That sentence begins by enumerating several \nCAA provisions authorizing EPA to take national actions. \nFor example, when EPA promulgates a national primary \nor secondary air quality standard under Section 7412, or \nsets a standard of performance for all new stationary \nsources of emissions under Section 7411, challenges to \nthose national actions \u201cmay be filed only in\u201d the D.C. Cir-\ncuit. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). In 1977, Congress amended the venue \nprovision to add a catchall phrase to that sentence: In  \naddition to the enumerated national actions, \u201cany other \nnationally applicable regulations promulgated, or final  \naction taken, by the Administrator under this chapter\u201d \nare reviewable only in the D.C. Circuit. Ibid.; see Clean \nAir Act Amendments of 1977, Pub. L. No. 95-95, 91 Stat. \n685 (Aug. 7, 1977).2 \n \n \n2  For ease of reference, the 1970 and 1982 versions of the \nvenue provision (the latter including the 1977 amendments) are \nprovided at App., infra, 29a and 30a, respectively. \n\n \n7 \nb. The second sentence follows the same basic struc-\nture but for non-national final agency actions. It first enu-\nmerates CAA provisions authorizing EPA to take actions \nthat apply to less than the whole country, and it makes \nthose actions reviewable only in regional circuit courts. \nFor example, when EPA approves or promulgates a state \nimplementation plan under Sections 7410 or 7411(d), a \nchallenge to that action \u201cmay be filed only in the United \nStates Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit.\u201d \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1). The second sentence of Section 7607(b)(1), \nlike the first, also includes a catchall phrase added by the \nsame 1977 amendment: \u201cany other final action of the  \nAdministrator under this chapter \u2026 which is locally or  \nregionally applicable\u201d is reviewable only in \u201cthe appropri-\nate circuit\u201d court. Ibid.  \nIdentifying which circuit court is \u201cappropriate\u201d for  \nreviewing local or regional final action is usually easy. \nThat\u2019s because for these EPA actions, the relevant sub-\nstantive CAA provision makes it clear that the action  \naffects particular regulated facilities or States, each of \nwhich is governed by a regional circuit court. When EPA \npromulgates a regional action that happens to touch more \nthan one federal circuit\u2014for example, approving or re-\njecting an implementation plan for the Metropolitan Kan-\nsas City air-quality-control region\u2014there may be more \nthan one appropriate circuit. \nc. The courts of appeals and EPA agree that, to  \nassess the national vs. local applicability of an EPA action \nfor purposes of Section 7607(b)(1), courts look only \u201cto the \nface\u201d of the action as that action is authorized by the \nCAA\u2014not to the challenger\u2019s arguments in the petition \nfor review, and not to the effects of the action or the rea-\nsoning within it. American Rd. & Transp. Builders Ass\u2019n \nv. EPA, 705 F.3d 453, 456 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (Kavanaugh, \n\n \n8 \nJ.); see also, e.g., ATK Launch Sys., Inc. v. EPA, 651 F.3d \n1194, 1197 (10th Cir. 2011); U.S. Br. 20 (invoking \u201cthe face \nof \u201d the actions). That focus on what action EPA took fol-\nlows from the statutory instruction to look to the \u201cfinal ac-\ntion \u2026 under this chapter\u201d to resolve venue. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). \nThe textual structure of Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s first two \nsentences\u2014enumerated lists of CAA actions followed by \ncatchall phrases\u2014indicates that courts should apply the \ncatchall phrases by reasoning by analogy to the enumer-\nated provisions. The catchall phrases use a \u201ccollective \nterm\u201d\u2014any other final action\u2014\u201cat the end of a list of spe-\ncific items,\u201d so the collective term is \u201ccontrolled and  \ndefined by reference to the specific classes that precede \nit.\u201d Fischer v. United States, 603 U.S. 480, 487 (2024) \n(ejusdem generis canon) (cleaned up); see Kentucky, 123 \nF.4th at 460 (using ejusdem generis to interpret Section \n7607(b)(1)). Thus, an EPA final action pursuant to an  \nunenumerated CAA provision is \u201cnationally applicable\u201d if \nit applies to the whole nation like the enumerated actions \nin the first sentence of Section 7607(b)(1) do. And a final  \naction is \u201clocally or regionally applicable\u201d if it applies to \nless than the whole nation, as the enumerated CAA  \nactions in the second sentence do. Ibid. \nd. The third sentence contemplates a narrow excep-\ntion for certain rare EPA actions that, though locally or \nregionally applicable, are \u201cbased on a determination of  \nnationwide scope or effect.\u201d \u00a7 7607(b)(1). That sentence \nwas added by the same 1977 amendment referenced \nabove, prompted by a recommendation from the Adminis-\ntrative Conference of the United States that included a \nstatement from EPA General Counsel William Frick. See \n41 Fed. Reg. 56,767 (Dec. 30, 1976).  \nFrick had identified a circumstance where the third-\nsentence exception was needed. 41 Fed. Reg. at 56,768-\n\n \n9 \n56,769. Under a particular CAA provision at the time \n(since repealed), EPA could grant extensions of a State\u2019s \nattainment date for certain national ambient air quality \nstandards\u2014actions that were locally applicable\u2014only \u201cif \nafter review ... the Administrator determine[d] that,\u201d \namong other things, regulated emission sources were  \n\u201cunable to comply with the [applicable] requirements \u2026 \nbecause the necessary technology or other alternatives \nare not available or will not be available soon enough to \npermit compliance.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857c-5(e) (1973) (empha-\nsis added); see NRDC v. EPA, 475 F.2d 968 (D.C. Cir. \n1973) (explaining the available-technology determination \nand corresponding extension action). \nFrick\u2019s statement, which the government agrees (U.S. \nBr. 37) was the genesis of the third sentence in Sec-\ntion 7607(b)(1), illustrates how that exception works: If \nthe statutory text requires a particular EPA action to be \nbased on a statutory \u201cdetermination\u201d about a circum-\nstance equally affecting the whole nation, then a chal-\nlenge to that action should go to the D.C. Circuit. \nCongress provided that \u201cif \u201d a locally applicable action \u201cis \nbased on a determination of nationwide scope or effect and \nif in taking such action [EPA] finds and publishes that \nsuch action is based on such a determination,\u201d then the \nproper venue is the D.C. Circuit. \u00a7 7607(b)(1).  \nThe third sentence thus establishes two independent \nrequirements for this exception: the action must actually \nbe based on a determination of nationwide scope or effect, \nand EPA must publish a finding that it is so based. Accord \nU.S. Br. 30. Whether EPA publishes that finding is the \nonly part of Section 7607(b)(1) that contemplates any dis-\ncretion for the agency. The text is thus \u201cclear\u201d that \u201c[t]he \ncourt\u2014not EPA\u2014determines both the scope of an  \naction\u2019s applicability and whether it was based on a deter-\n\n \n10 \nmination of nationwide scope or effect.\u201d Texas v. EPA \n(\u201cTexas 2020\u201d), 983 F.3d 826, 833 (5th Cir. 2020); accord  \nSierra Club v. EPA, 47 F.4th 738, 746 (D.C. Cir. 2022). \ne. In sum, the CAA allocates venue for regulatory \nchallenges depending on the nature of the \u201cfinal action\u201d \nunder review: If EPA\u2019s \u201cfinal action \u2026 under this chap-\nter\u201d is \u201cnationally applicable,\u201d then the proper venue is \nthe D.C. Circuit. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). If EPA\u2019s \u201cfinal action \u2026  \nunder this chapter\u201d is \u201clocally or regionally applicable,\u201d \nthen the proper venue is presumptively a regional circuit \ncourt. Ibid.; see Texas v. EPA (\u201cTexas 2016\u201d), 829 F.3d \n405, 419, 424 (5th Cir. 2016). If EPA can demonstrate both \nthat a locally applicable action is \u201cbased on a determina-\ntion of nationwide scope or effect\u201d\u2014that is, a textually \ncalled for determination reaching all the nation\u2019s regu-\nlated parties equally\u2014\u201cand\u201d that EPA \u201cf [ound] and pub-\nlishe[d] that such action is based on such a determination,\u201d \nthen venue is proper in the D.C. Circuit. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). \nThe first question for venue, then, is: What is the \u201cfinal \naction \u2026 under this chapter\u201d that EPA was authorized to \ntake? To answer that question, courts \u201clook primarily to \nthe text of the statute,\u201d specifically to the relevant CAA \nprovision that is \u201cthe legal source of [EPA\u2019s] authority to \ntake the challenged action[ ].\u201d Texas v. EPA (\u201cTexas \n2023\u201d), No. 23-60069, 2023 WL 7204840, at *4 (5th Cir. \nMay 1, 2023); see Kentucky, 123 F.4th at 460-462; West \nVirginia v. EPA, 90 F.4th 323, 329 (4th Cir. 2024). \n2. Small-refinery hardship petitions under the \nAct\u2019s RFS Program \na. The CAA\u2019s RFS program requires that increasing \namounts of renewable fuels be blended into the transpor-\ntation fuel (gasoline and diesel) sold in the United States. \n\u00a7 7545(o)(2)(A)(i), (B)(i)(I)-(IV); see HollyFrontier Chey-\nenne Refin., LLC v. Renewable Fuels Ass\u2019n, 594 U.S. 382, \n\n \n11 \n385-387 (2021). EPA first sets annual renewable fuel per-\ncentage standards across the industry. \u00a7 7545(o)(3). Obli-\ngated parties\u2014refiners and importers of transportation \nfuel\u2014use those standards to learn their own annual vol-\nume obligations for each renewable-fuel category. See 40 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 80.1406. \nObligated parties comply with their annual RFS obli-\ngations by \u201cretiring\u201d credits called renewable identifica-\ntion numbers (\u201cRINs\u201d). 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 80.1427. A RIN is \ngenerated when renewable fuel (ethanol, for example) is \nmanufactured. Id. \u00a7 80.1426. The RIN remains attached \nto the volume of renewable fuel until it is blended into \ntransportation fuel, at which point the RIN is \u201csepa-\nrated.\u201d Id. \u00a7\u00a7 80.1428, 80.1429. RINs have a limited life; \nthey can be used for compliance only in the year they are \ngenerated or the next compliance year. \u00a7 7545(o)(5)(C). \nObligated parties demonstrate RFS compliance by secur-\ning sufficient separated RINs, either by generating RINs \nthrough blending renewable fuels or by purchasing RINs \nfrom others that blend. \u00a7 7545(o)(5)(B). \nb. \u201cThe RFS program reflects a carefully crafted leg-\nislative bargain to promote renewable fuels, but also to \nprovide an exemption mechanism for small refineries.\u201d \nSinclair Wyoming Refin. Co. LLC v. EPA, 114 F.4th 693, \n711 (D.C. Cir. 2024). A \u201csmall refinery\u201d has an average \naggregate daily crude oil throughput for a calendar year \nof 75,000 barrels or less. \u00a7 7545(o)(1)(K). Congress recog-\nnized that \u201cescalating [RFS] obligations could work spe-\ncial burdens on small refineries,\u201d many of which \u201clack the \ninherent scale advantages of large refineries\u201d and are lim-\nited in their ability to blend renewable fuels\u2014or are una-\nble to blend at all. HollyFrontier, 594 U.S. at 386 (cleaned \nup). Congress also understood that small refineries are \n\n \n12 \nessential to the nation\u2019s energy supply and often \u201ca major \nsource of jobs in rural communities.\u201d Id. at 386-387. \nEPA has acknowledged that \u201c[m]any\u201d small refineries \n\u201cdo not have access to renewable fuels or the ability to \nblend them, and so must use credits to comply\u201d with the \nRFS. 72 Fed. Reg. 23,900, 23,904 (May 1, 2007). Small  \nrefineries that cannot separate enough RINs through \nblending are forced to buy RINs on an unregulated sec-\nondary market where prices can fluctuate wildly. See 75 \nFed. Reg. 14,670, 14,722 (Mar. 26, 2010) (explaining RIN \nspot markets); HollyFrontier, 594 U.S. at 398 (noting one \nyear where RIN prices \u201cshot up by as much as 100%\u201d). \nCongress initially exempted all small refineries from \nthe RFS until 2011, and it directed the U.S. Department \nof Energy (\u201cDOE\u201d) to study whether RFS compliance \nwould impose disproportionate economic hardship on \nsmall refineries. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(A). DOE completed that \nstudy in 2011, finding that small refineries \u201chave particu-\nlar obstacles that would make compliance more costly \nthan those of large integrated companies.\u201d DOE, Small \nRefinery Exemption Study: An Investigation into Dispro-\nportionate Economic Hardship 3, 32, 37 (March 2011) \n(\u201c2011 DOE Study\u201d).3 DOE also recognized that small  \nrefineries\u2019 hardship would grow increasingly acute as  \nrenewable-fuel blending mandates increased. Id. at 17-18.  \nTo avoid damaging small refineries, Congress created \na permanent safety valve that allows a small refinery to \npetition EPA for an exemption from its annual RFS obli-\ngation \u201cfor the reason of disproportionate economic hard-\nship.\u201d \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(i). The Act provides that \u201c[a] small \nrefinery may at any time petition the Administrator\u201d for \n \n3  https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-12/docu-\nments/small-refinery-exempt-study.pdf. \n\n \n13 \nan exemption\u2014and thus requires each small refinery to \npetition separately for hardship relief. Ibid. (emphasis \nadded). Each granted petition frees only one small refin-\nery from its RFS obligation for the year(s) involved in the \npetition, based on that refinery\u2019s economic circumstances. \n\u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(i)-(ii); 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 80.1441(e)(2). EPA must \ndecide each small-refinery hardship petition in \u201cconsulta-\ntion\u201d with DOE after \u201cconsider[ing] the findings\u201d of DOE\u2019s \n2011 small-refinery study along with \u201cother economic fac-\ntors.\u201d \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(A)-(B). \nCongress required EPA to decide any hardship  \npetition submitted by a small refinery \u201cnot later than 90 \ndays after\u201d receipt, because a small refinery cannot plan \nadequately for RFS compliance until it knows whether it \nhas an obligation. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(iii). But EPA has failed \nto meet that deadline for almost 90 percent of hardship \npetitions submitted since 2013, causing significant uncer-\ntainty for small refineries. See U.S. Government Account-\nability Office, Renewable Fuel Standard: Actions Needed \nto Improve Decision-Making in the Small Refinery Ex-\nemption Program 20, GAO23104273 (Nov. 2022).4 \nc. When EPA has denied small-refinery hardship  \npetitions, the petitioners sometimes sought judicial review. \nRegarding venue for those challenges, EPA repeatedly \nacknowledged that RFS hardship-exemption decisions \nare \u201cquintessentially local action[s]\u201d that must be reviewed \nin the regional circuit courts. E.g., EPA Motion to Dismiss \n18, Advanced Biofuels Ass\u2019n v. EPA, No. 18-1115, Dkt. \n1740614 (D.C. Cir. July 13, 2018). \nOn the merits of those challenges, EPA suffered a \nstreak of losses where circuit courts vacated its hardship \ndecisions. See Sinclair Wyoming Refin. Co. v. EPA, 887 \n \n4  https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-23-104273. \n\n \n14 \nF.3d 986 (10th Cir. 2017); Ergon-West Virginia, Inc. v. \nEPA, 896 F.3d 600 (4th Cir. 2018); Renewable Fuels Ass\u2019n \nv. EPA, 948 F.3d 1206 (10th Cir. 2020); Ergon-West Vir-\nginia, Inc. v. EPA, 980 F.3d 403 (4th Cir. 2020). Frus-\ntrated by its repeated defeats in the regional circuits, and \nafter a 2021 change in presidential administration, EPA \nbegan attempting to eliminate small-refinery hardship  \nrelief altogether. EPA first abandoned defense of its own \nprior decisions granting hardship relief and began newly \ninsisting that a small refinery cannot receive relief unless \nit had received an exemption in every prior compliance \nyear. This Court rejected that new position in HollyFron-\ntier. 594 U.S. at 396-397. \nWhen that effort failed, EPA went back to the drawing \nboard intent on rejecting hardship relief and avoiding  \njudicial review anywhere other than the D.C. Circuit. \nB. The present controversy \n1. The small-refinery respondents here have repeat-\nedly received RFS hardship relief from EPA in the past, \nbecause each of them faces structural disadvantages that \nmake RFS compliance disproportionately burdensome. \nThe respondents petitioned EPA again for hardship relief \nfor some or all of the compliance years 2017 through 2021. \nPet.App.19a nn.26-27. EPA initially granted Wynne-\nwood\u2019s hardship petition for 2017, and it granted Calumet \nShreveport\u2019s, Ergon Refining\u2019s, Placid\u2019s, and Wynne-\nwood\u2019s petitions for 2018. See EPA, Decision on 2018 \nSmall Refinery Exemption Petitions (Aug. 9, 2019).5 \nIn December 2021, however, EPA reversed itself and \nissued a proposal to deny every pending small-refinery \nhardship petition, including by retroactively denying pre-\n \n5 https://www.regulations.gov/comment/EPA-HQ-OAR-2021-\n0566-0077#collapseAttachmentMetadata-ember186 (Tab I). \n\n \n15 \nviously granted petitions. 86 Fed. Reg. 70,999 (Dec. 14, \n2021). EPA proposed to do so by applying multiple sea-\nchanges to the agency\u2019s longstanding approach to hard-\nship petitions. See Proposed Denials.6 EPA also proposed, \nhowever, to continue its existing practice of deciding hard-\nship petitions through agency adjudication, because ap-\nplying a new rulemaking process to hardship petitions \nfrom prior years would have been unlawfully retroactive. \nSee Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hosp., 488 U.S. 204, 208-\n209 (1988). \nEPA\u2019s proposed denials included a new statutory in-\nterpretation and a new \u201ceconomic theory\u201d hypothesizing \nthat \u201cthe RFS program cannot cause [disproportionate \neconomic hardship]\u201d because RIN costs are supposedly \nthe same for all obligated parties regardless of their size, \nbargaining power, location, or blending capability, and  \nbecause obligated parties supposedly universally pass \nthrough 100% of their RIN costs in the price of the fuel \nthey sell. Proposed Denials 11-12 & n.37. Small refineries \ncommented on the proposal, explaining why EPA\u2019s new \nstatutory position was textually unsupportable and why \ntheir individual economic evidence refuted EPA\u2019s hypoth-\nesis that small refineries universally pass on RIN costs. \nE.g., JA 131-275. \nIn April 2022, in the first set of administrative actions \nchallenged here, EPA followed through on its proposal \nand simultaneously denied 36 previously decided hard-\nship petitions (31 of which EPA had previously granted), \nincluding petitions submitted by these respondents. \nPet.App.189a-330a (the \u201cApril Denials\u201d). EPA announced \nit was satisfied that each of the petitioning small refineries \n \n6  EPA, Proposed RFS Small Refinery Exemption Decision \n(Dec. \n2021), \nhttps://www.epa.gov/renewable-fuel-standard-\nprogram/proposal-deny-petitions-small-refinery-exemptions. \n\n \n16 \nwas able to fully pass through its RIN costs in the price of \nits fuel. Id. at 209a-212a. EPA issued each small refinery \na \u201cconfidential, refinery-specific appendi[x]\u201d to the April \nDenials\u2019 explanation document, giving individualized rea-\nsons for its conclusion that each refinery could pass \nthrough 100% of its RFS costs. Id. at 199a. \nIn June 2022, EPA largely copied and pasted its April \nreasoning to announce the denial of another 69 hardship \npetitions, including these small-refinery respondents\u2019  \npetitions for some or all of the 2017 and 2019-2021 years. \nPet.App.44a-188a (the \u201cJune Denials\u201d). The June Denials\u2019 \nexplanation document stated \u201cthat none of the 69 pending \n[small-refinery hardship] petitions for the 2016-2021 com-\npliance years ha[s] demonstrated [disproportionate eco-\nnomic hardship] caused by the cost of compliance with the \nrequirements of the RFS program.\u201d Pet.App.185a. EPA \nagain provided separate \u201cconfidential, refinery-specific \nappendices\u201d explaining its findings on each small refin-\nery\u2019s RIN-cost passthrough. Pet.App.55a. \nThe refinery-specific appendices accompanying the \nApril and June Denials detailed EPA\u2019s individualized  \nassessments of each small refinery\u2019s economic condition. \nFor example, EPA considered whether one respondent \nrefinery could blend enough biodiesel given that it oper-\nates in a market that does not accept biodiesel blends, and \nwhether that refinery faced higher ethanol costs than \nother large refiners and blenders in its area. JA 285-287. \nEPA considered whether another respondent faced \nhigher transportation costs for shipping from terminals \nalong the Gulf Coast. JA 293-295. And EPA considered \nthe price impacts to another respondent from the fact \nthat, in its tri-State region, the small refinery faced dimin-\nished demand for kerosene-based jet fuel and more- \nstringent specifications for ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel. JA \n\n \n17 \n312-313. It was based on individualized, refinery-specific  \nconsiderations like those\u2014how each refinery fits in its \nown local market\u2014that EPA concluded that each of the \npetitioning small refineries \u201cis recovering its [RFS com-\npliance] costs,\u201d and for that reason is not experiencing dis-\nproportionate economic hardship. E.g., JA 280, 286, 298. \nEPA accomplished its bundled denial decisions only \nby ignoring the statutory deadline to decide the hardship \npetitions; it held dozens beyond the 90-day deadline so \nthat it could deny them together and create the appear-\nance of promulgating just two actions. \n2. The small-refinery respondents filed petitions for \njudicial review of EPA\u2019s denials of their RFS hardship  \npetitions. Because the refineries each are headquartered, \nincorporated, or operate within the Fifth Circuit, they \nsought review there. Two groups representing the inter-\nests of the biofuel industry\u2014the respondents in support \nof petitioner here (\u201cBiofuel respondents\u201d)\u2014intervened to \nsupport EPA\u2019s denials of hardship relief. \nEPA moved to dismiss the petitions or transfer them \nto the D.C. Circuit, asserting that because it had bundled \ntogether its hardship-petition denial decisions, they were \n\u201cnationally applicable\u201d or else \u201cbased on a determination \nof nationwide scope or effect.\u201d \u00a7 7607(b)(1). \nThe Fifth Circuit denied EPA\u2019s motions. Pet.App.9a-\n15a. EPA\u2019s actions denying the small refineries\u2019 hardship \npetitions were \u201clocally \u2026 applicable,\u201d not \u201cnationally  \napplicable,\u201d because they affected only the individual  \npetitioning small refineries. Id. at 11a-12a. Nor were \nEPA\u2019s actions based on any nationwide determination. Id. \nat 12a-13a. EPA conceded that it had \u201cconsidered each  \npetition on the merits and individual refinery infor-\nmation.\u201d Id. at 14a (cleaned up). And EPA\u2019s explanation \ndocuments confirm that the agency\u2019s final actions\u2014its  \n\n \n18 \nultimate denials of the hardship-exemption petitions\u2014\n\u201cre[lied] on refinery-specific determinations\u201d about each \nrefinery\u2019s own \u201ceconomic hardship\u201d factors. Id. at 15a. \nOn the merits of the small refineries\u2019 challenges, the \nFifth Circuit explained at length why EPA\u2019s hardship- \ndenial actions were \u201c(1) impermissibly retroactive; \n(2) contrary to law; and (3) counter to the record evi-\ndence.\u201d Pet.App.3a; see id. at 16a-33a. \nThe Biofuel respondents filed petitions for rehearing \nand rehearing en banc. Those were denied. Pet.App.332a-\n333a. \n3. Some other small refineries whose RFS hardship \npetitions were denied as part of EPA\u2019s April and June  \nDenials chose to petition for judicial review only in the \nD.C. Circuit. And still other small refineries filed petitions \nfor review in the regional circuits but had their petitions \ntransferred to the D.C. Circuit\u2014most without a substan-\ntive explanation or opinion. See U.S. Br. 13 & nn.2-3. \nIn July 2024, the D.C. Circuit unanimously agreed \nwith the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \u201canalysis and conclusion\u201d on the \nmerits that EPA\u2019s April and June Denials were \u201ccontrary \nto law\u201d and must be vacated. Sinclair Wyoming, 114 \nF.4th at 706-707 & n.5. The D.C. Circuit also held that the \ndenials were arbitrary and capricious because \u201creality  \nundercuts EPA\u2019s\u201d economic \u201ctheory\u201d that small refineries \ncan universally pass on their RIN costs. Id. at 713. \n \n\n \n19 \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nA. The Fifth Circuit correctly held that EPA\u2019s final \nactions challenged here were locally applicable rather \nthan nationally applicable, and were based on respond-\nents\u2019 local economic circumstances rather than any deter-\nmination of nationwide scope or effect.  \n1. Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s reference to the agency\u2019s \u201cfinal \naction \u2026 under this chapter\u201d indicates that it is the sub-\nstantive CAA text that determines what final actions the \nagency was authorized to take. Whether and how EPA \nchooses to bundle its final actions is irrelevant to venue. \nHere, every part of the relevant provision under the \n\u201cchapter\u201d\u2014especially the singular, definite articles and \nthe deadline for deciding hardship petitions indexed to \neach petition\u2019s submission date\u2014indicates that Congress \ndirected EPA to produce individualized final actions on  \nindividually submitted hardship petitions. \n2. EPA\u2019s individual denials of hardship relief were \nobviously locally appliable rather than nationally applica-\nble. The government does not argue otherwise. Those  \ndecisions on individually submitted petitions affecting \nonly one refinery look nothing like the enumerated nation-\nwide actions in Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s first sentence, but they \nclosely resemble the enumerated locally applicable ac-\ntions in the second sentence. \n3. \u201cDetermination\u201d is a term of art in the CAA. An \nEPA action is based on a determination of nationwide \nscope or effect in the rare instance where the CAA\u2019s text \ndirects EPA to make a \u201cdetermination\u201d about the entire \nnation or industry, without the need to consider individual \ncircumstances. But here, the CAA required EPA to base \nits hardship decisions on each petitioning small refinery\u2019s \nindividual economic hardship factors. And EPA\u2019s own doc-\numents confirm that the agency did just that. \n\n \n20 \nB. The government\u2019s arguments seeking D.C. Circuit \nreview fail. \n1. The government goes astray because it gets the \nrelevant \u201caction\u201d wrong. EPA contends that its denials of \n105 individually submitted hardship petitions were really \njust two actions, asserting that a court may not contest \nEPA\u2019s \u201ccharacterization\u201d of its actions. But it is the text \nof \u201cth[e] chapter,\u201d not EPA, that determines what final \nactions the agency is authorized to take.  \n2. EPA\u2019s argument for national applicability depends \non the Court accepting the agency\u2019s view of the relevant \nunit of administrative action. Even if EPA were correct \nthat the bundled decision announcements were the rele-\nvant actions, those still were not nationally applicable  \nbecause they applied only to those refineries that chose to \npetition for hardship relief, not to the whole nation. EPA \nasserts that any agency action that touches more than one \njudicial circuit is nationally applicable. But that argument \nproduces the absurd result that an expressly regional  \naction for a metropolitan region that happens to encom-\npass two States (and two circuits) would be \u201cnationally ap-\nplicable\u201d and reviewable only by the D.C. Circuit. \n3. Contrary to EPA\u2019s assertion, the hardship denial \nactions were not based on any determination of nation-\nwide scope or effect. \nThe relevant text of the \u201cchapter\u201d here, unlike other \nclosely related provisions, does not call for any \u201cdetermi-\nnation\u201d on a small-refinery hardship petition. EPA\u2019s argu-\nment depends on treating \u201cdetermination\u201d not as a term \nof art but as an amorphous concept of anything that con-\ntributed significantly to an EPA action. \nIn any event, neither EPA\u2019s new interpretation of the \nAct, nor its new RIN-cost-passthrough economic hypoth-\nesis, were \u201cnationwide determinations\u201d that formed the \n\n \n21 \n\u201cbas[is]\u201d for EPA\u2019s hardship denial decisions. Every EPA \naction necessarily rests to some degree on the agency\u2019s \nunderstanding of its statutory authority. And EPA is  \nrequired to apply a \u201cuniform\u201d statutory interpretation to \nsimilarly situated small-refinery petitioners\u2014anything \nelse would have been arbitrary. Moreover, EPA\u2019s new \nstatutory reading could not be the basis for final actions \non respondents\u2019 hardship petitions; EPA expressly did \nnot use a rulemaking here. EPA achieved final actions \nonly by applying its statutory interpretation to respond-\nents\u2019 individual economic facts. \nFor the same reason, even if EPA\u2019s economic theory \ncould qualify as a \u201cdetermination\u201d under the CAA, the  \nfinal actions denying respondents\u2019 hardship petitions \nwere not \u201cbased on\u201d it. Moving beyond hypothesis to final \nactions required EPA to test its prediction against re-\nspondents\u2019 economic evidence. And EPA acknowledges on \nthe face of the denial decisions that it did so. \nEPA\u2019s decisions here do not resemble the unusual \nCAA provision that was the genesis for the nationwide-\ndetermination exception sentence in Section 7607(b)(1).  \nEPA\u2019s appeals to policy cannot overcome the statutory \ntext. And in any event, EPA\u2019s attempt to force dozens of \nsmall refineries to litigate their RFS hardship-denial  \ndecisions together in the D.C. Circuit has served only to  \nobscure judicial consideration of the individual economic \nfactors that the CAA makes the core basis for hardship \nrelief. \n \n \n\n \n22 \nARGUMENT \nSection 7607(b)(1) sets the venue for a petition for  \nreview principally by asking whether the EPA \u201cfinal  \naction\u201d being challenged is nationally applicable or  \nlocally/regionally applicable. Courts identify the relevant \n\u201cfinal action\u201d by examining the substantive text of \u201cth[e] \nchapter\u201d\u2014the CAA. Here the chapter designates the final \nactions as EPA\u2019s denials of small refineries\u2019 individually \nsubmitted RFS hardship petitions. The statutory text \ncalls for individualized consideration of each petitioning \nsmall refinery\u2019s \u201cdisproportionate economic hardship.\u201d \n\u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B). \nOnce EPA\u2019s individual denial decisions are properly \nidentified as the \u201cfinal action[s]\u201d under challenge, their \nnational vs. local applicability is obvious: Those individual \ndenials are, as EPA has always said, \u201cquintessentially  \nlocal action[s]\u201d for Section 7607(b)(1) because they \u201cadju-\ndicate[ ] legal rights as to a single refinery in a single loca-\ntion.\u201d EPA Motion 18, Advanced Biofuels, No. 18-1115, \nsupra. The face of the actions here confirms that EPA \nreached final decisions only by examining refinery-specific \nevidence and reaching refinery-specific conclusions that \nnone of these respondents experiences disproportionate \neconomic hardship from the RFS. Indeed, the statutory \ntext compelled EPA to deny hardship relief based on the \npetitioning small refineries\u2019 own economic circum-\nstances\u2014not any nationwide determination. So the Fifth \nCircuit correctly held that it was the proper venue rather \nthan the D.C. Circuit. \nThe government contends (U.S. Br. 28-29) that these \nhardship-petition denial actions are nationally applica-\nble\u2014unlike all prior hardship decisions\u2014because EPA \nhas \u201ccharacteriz[ed]\u201d them differently. EPA conceives of \nits decisions denying 105 separately submitted hardship \n\n \n23 \npetitions as just two national actions because it chose to \nannounce those denials together. But EPA does not  \ndecide what the relevant \u201cfinal action\u201d is under the CAA\u2014\nthe statute does. The substantive CAA provision at issue \ndesignates each individual hardship decision as the rele-\nvant unit of administrative action, none of which applies in \nmore than one circuit. EPA\u2019s suggestions that any action \nhappening to touch more than one circuit is \u201cnationally  \napplicable,\u201d and that it can manufacture nationally appli-\ncable actions by bundling individual decisions together, \nare inconsistent with the CAA\u2019s text, context, and history, \nas well as common sense. \nAlternatively, EPA claims that these hardship deci-\nsions are locally applicable but based on a new statutory \ninterpretation and economic theory that have nationwide \nscope or effect. Wrong, both times. EPA\u2019s musings about \nits statutory instructions, and its generalized economic \nhypothesis about small refineries\u2019 RIN costs, were merely \nsteps along the way of EPA\u2019s individual-refinery deci-\nsionmaking process. Neither was a \u201cdetermination\u201d\u2014 \na term of art in the CAA\u2014called for by the text. And nei-\nther produced any final agency action. EPA\u2019s final actions \nwere instead expressly based on its conclusions about \neach petitioning small refinery\u2019s economic circumstances. \nEPA itself says it denied respondents\u2019 hardship petitions \nbased on its (erroneous) view that each refinery \u201cis recov-\nering its [RFS compliance] costs.\u201d E.g., JA 280, 286, 298 \n(emphasis added). \nUnder the venue instructions in Section 7607(b)(1),  \nreview of these hardship-petition actions belongs in the \nregional circuit courts\u2014exactly where prior actions on \nsimilar petitions have long been reviewed. The Fifth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s judgment should be affirmed. \n\n \n24 \nA. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision was correct. \nIdentifying the proper venue for judicial review under \nSection 7607(b)(1) involves three questions: (1) What  \n\u201cfinal action\u201d did EPA take \u201cunder\u201d the CAA? (2) Was \nthat final action locally or regionally applicable, as opposed \nto nationally applicable? (3) If so, was the action neverthe-\nless \u201cbased on a determination of nationwide scope or  \neffect\u201d? The Fifth Circuit answered each of those ques-\ntions correctly. \n1. The \u201cfinal action[s]\u201d are EPA\u2019s denials of each \nsmall-refinery\u2019s hardship petition. \na. The parties and the courts of appeals agree that \n\u201cSection 7607(b)(1) categorizes petitions for [judicial]  \nreview according to the nature of the [EPA] action\u201d being \nchallenged. Texas 2016, 829 F.3d at 419; accord U.S. Br. \n20 (citing additional cases). But a court cannot assess an  \naction\u2019s nature until it identifies \u201cwhat \u2018final action\u2019 [it is] \ndealing with.\u201d Kentucky v. EPA, Nos. 23-3216/23-3225, \n2023 WL 11871967, at *2 (6th Cir. July 25, 2023).  \nThe statute helpfully describes how to answer that \nquestion: refer to the \u201cfinal action of [EPA] under this \nchapter.\u201d \u00a7 7607(b)(1) (emphasis added). \u201c[T]his chapter\u201d \nis the CAA. See p. 6, supra. Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s phrase  \n\u201cfinal action \u2026 under this chapter\u201d points the reader to \nthe substantive CAA provision that provides \u201cthe legal \nsource of the agency\u2019s \u2026 authority to take the challenged \nactions.\u201d Texas 2023, 2023 WL 7204840, at *4; see p. 10, \nsupra (additional cases making the same point). \nSection 7607(b)(1)\u2019s overall structure makes this even \nmore clear. By enumerating specific CAA sections author-\nizing national or local/regional actions in the first two sen-\ntences, and then adding a catchall clause to each sentence \nfor \u201cany other\u201d nationally or locally/regionally applicable \naction, the venue provision repeatedly requires cross ref-\n\n \n25 \nerencing the CAA provision that authorized the EPA  \naction under challenge. See Kentucky, 123 F.4th at 461 \n(Section 7607(b)(1) \u201cfocuses on the statute \u2026 to distin-\nguish\u201d national vs. local/regional actions). \nb. The \u201cfinal action\u201d that the CAA authorized here is \nfor EPA to \u201cact on\u201d a small refinery\u2019s individually submit-\nted RFS hardship petition. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B); see Pet.App. \n185a (EPA invoking \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B) as its source of author-\nity). So that is the \u201crelevant unit of administrative action\u201d \nfor venue purposes. Texas 2023, 2023 WL 7204840, at *4.  \nEverything about that substantive text demonstrates \nthat EPA\u2019s final actions on hardship petitions are to be \nindividualized. Every reference in that subsection to the \n\u201cpetition\u201d or the petitioning \u201crefinery\u201d is in the singular: \n\u201cA small refinery may at any time petition\u201d EPA for a \nhardship exemption, based on the \u201creason of dispropor-\ntionate economic hardship\u201d if required to comply with the \nRFS. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(i) (emphasis added). EPA must \n\u201cevaluat[e] a petition,\u201d considering the findings of the \n2011 DOE small-refinery study and other economic fac-\ntors. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(ii) (emphasis added). Whether a par-\nticular petitioning small refinery is experiencing dis-\nproportionate economic hardship from the RFS in a given \nyear is necessarily an individualized inquiry focused on \nthat refinery\u2019s own economic circumstances.  \nCongress also provided that the statutory deadline for \nEPA to \u201cact on any [small-refinery hardship] petition\u201d is \nindexed to each petition: \u201cnot later than 90 days after the \ndate of receipt of the petition.\u201d \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(iii). That \nprovision forcefully confirms that Congress directed EPA \nto produce individualized actions on hardship petitions; \nthe rolling, refinery-specific deadlines would make no \nsense otherwise. Cf. Kentucky, 123 F.4th at 461 (EPA\u2019s \nobligation \u201cto \u2018act\u2019 on each State\u2019s \u2018submission\u2019 on a plan-\n\n \n26 \nby-plan basis within a specified time\u201d indicates those  \nactions are locally rather than nationally applicable) (cita-\ntion omitted). And as mentioned above (p. 17, supra), EPA \nwas able to produce bundled hardship decisions only by \ndeliberately ignoring the CAA\u2019s decision deadline. \nThe broader statutory context also shows that Con-\ngress did not intend its \u201csingular\u201d definite and indefinite \narticles in this subsection to \u201cinclude and apply to several \npersons, parties, or things.\u201d Contra U.S. Br. 26 (quoting \n1 U.S.C. \u00a7 1). Congress initially granted a blanket exemp-\ntion from the RFS through 2011 to all \u201csmall refineries\u201d\u2014\nplural. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(A)(i). Congress then directed EPA to \nextend that exemption for another two years on an indi-\nvidualized basis to only \u201ca\u201d small refinery that DOE  \ndetermined would face disproportionate economic hard-\nship from the RFS. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(A)(ii)(II). After that, Con-\ngress transitioned to the current petition-based approach. \n\u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B). The statute now puts the onus on each \nsmall refinery to request hardship relief based on its own \n\u201cdisproportionate economic hardship.\u201d \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(i). \nCongress knew how to authorize blanket or multiple  \nexemption actions, but it did not do so here. Congress  \ninstead directed EPA to \u201cact on\u201d \u201cthe petition\u201d \u201csubmit-\nted by a small refinery.\u201d \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(iii) (emphases \nadded). \nc. Federal courts\u2019 practice also reflects the reality \nthat EPA\u2019s individual hardship-exemption decisions are \nthe final actions for venue purposes. When the Fifth Cir-\ncuit below held that EPA\u2019s denial decisions were unlawful, \nit did not vacate all 105 EPA denial decisions, despite the \ngovernment\u2019s urging that it had produced just two na-\ntional actions. Instead, the Fifth Circuit properly vacated \nonly the denial decisions for the small refineries before it. \nPet.App.34a. \n\n \n27 \nIn another recent case involving subsequent small- \nrefinery hardship decisions that EPA bundled together, \nthe government moved the D.C. Circuit to act separately \non the denial decisions for particular refineries\u2014to vacate \nsome final actions in EPA\u2019s bundle but not others. See \nCalumet Montana Refin., LLC v. EPA, No. 23-1194, Dkt. \n2081226 (Oct. 21, 2024); see id., Dkt. 2091139 (Dec. 23, \n2024) (D.C. Circuit granting limited vacatur in accord with \nEPA\u2019s request). That motion confirms EPA\u2019s agreement \nthat, even when it bundles small-refinery hardship deci-\nsions together, courts review the individual final actions \nthat apply to each refinery. And EPA would surely take \nthe position that each denied refinery must file a petition \nfor review to obtain judicial review at all. \n* \nThe relevant \u201cfinal action[s]\u201d for venue purposes are \nthus EPA\u2019s decisions on each small refinery\u2019s hardship \npetition, regardless of EPA\u2019s choice to bundle its petition  \ndecisions. Accord Kentucky, 123 F.4th at 460-463 (reject-\ning EPA\u2019s argument that its consolidated disapprovals of \n21 state implementation plans constituted a single action). \nOnce the action is properly identified, it \u201cmakes this case \neasy.\u201d Id. at 461. EPA\u2019s individual denial decisions are  \nobviously locally/regionally applicable\u2014the government \ndoesn\u2019t try to argue otherwise. And those decisions did \nnot involve any nationwide \u201cdetermination\u201d called for by \nthe CAA. Rather, each was based (as they must be per the \nAct) on EPA\u2019s refinery-specific evaluations of each peti-\ntioning small refinery\u2019s own economic hardship factors\u2014\nthings like local-market acceptance of renewable fuel, \npercentage of diesel production, access to capital, etc. See, \ne.g., JA 280, 285-287, 293-298. \n\n \n28 \n2. EPA\u2019s denials of the hardship petitions are \u201clocally \nor regionally applicable\u201d actions. \na. The venue provision\u2019s \u201capplicability\u201d inquiry\u2014 \nnationally vs. locally/regionally applicable\u2014asks about \n\u201cthe location of the persons or enterprises that the action \nregulates.\u201d Texas v. EPA, No. 10-60961, 2011 WL 710598, \nat *3 (5th Cir. Feb. 24, 2011) (quoting New York v. EPA, \n133 F.3d 987, 990 (7th Cir. 1998)). Multiple courts of  \nappeals have agreed, at the government\u2019s urging, that \nwhat matters is \u201cthe face of \u201d the action, American Road, \n705 F.3d at 456 (Kavanaugh, J.), not the action\u2019s reasoning \nor practical \u201ceffects,\u201d ATK Launch, 651 F.3d at 1197.  \nAccord U.S. Br. 20-21 (citing additional cases).7 \nThe \u201c \u2018ordinary meaning\u2019 \u201d of the \u201ckey words\u201d in Sec-\ntion 7607(b)(1)\u2019s first sentence\u2014\u201c \u2018nationally applicable \nregulations promulgated, or final action taken\u2019 by the \nEPA\u201d\u2014\u201cconvey[s] that the challenged regulations or  \naction must apply to the entire country.\u201d Kentucky, 123 \nF.4th at 459 (emphasis added; citations omitted). The \nSixth Circuit\u2019s Kentucky opinion gives the relevant dic-\ntionary definitions, see ibid., though it\u2019s \u201cdoubt[ful] that \nwe need dictionaries for this point,\u201d ibid. The word \u201cna-\ntionally\u201d refers to an EPA action affecting the \u201cnation as \na whole.\u201d Ibid. (citation omitted). \nTwo different canons of construction confirm that  \ninterpretation. The first is ejusdem generis. See Ken-\ntucky, 123 F.4th at 460. Because the phrase \u201cnationally \napplicable\u201d comes in a catchall clause following an enu-\nmerated list of national CAA actions, courts determine \n \n7  Biofuel respondents\u2019 alternative theory (Br. 21)\u2014that the \nkey to venue is what arguments might be raised in a petition \nfor review challenging the agency action\u2014has been repeatedly \nrejected. It is contrary to the textual instruction to look to the \n\u201cfinal action \u2026 under this chapter.\u201d \u00a7 7607(b)(1). \n\n \n29 \nthe meaning of \u201cnationally applicable\u201d by reference to the \nenumerated actions. Ibid. (citing Bissonnette v. LePage \nBakeries Park St., LLC, 601 U.S. 246, 252 (2024)). And the \nfirst sentence\u2019s enumerated CAA actions all \u201chave nation-\nwide applicability,\u201d ibid.: They regulate across the whole \nnation without individualized consideration, and they  \napply irrespective of whether any party requested agency \naction or not. By contrast, the enumerated locally applica-\nble actions in Section 7607(b)(1) involve individual regu-\nlated entities or States. Finding a \u201cnationally applicable\u201d \naction for purposes of the catchall clause thus requires \nidentifying an EPA final action that similarly affects the \nentire nation, irrespective of a party\u2019s local circumstances. \nSecond, \u201ccourts presume that Congress means to \nadopt \u2018clear boundaries\u2019 in \u2018jurisdictional statutes\u2019 to avoid \nwasteful litigation over the proper forum.\u201d Kentucky, 123 \nF.4th at 460 (quoting Direct Mktg. Ass\u2019n v. Brohl, 575 \nU.S. 1, 11 (2015), and citing other cases). The courts of  \nappeals have agreed that Section 7607(b)(1) is a venue \nprovision rather than a jurisdictional one.8 But the basic \npoint is the same: No one\u2019s interests are served by com-\nplex disputes over venue. Clear boundaries are set by giv-\ning \u201cnationally applicable\u201d its ordinary meaning: An EPA \nfinal action is \u201cnationally applicable\u201d for purposes of  \nSection 7607(b)(1) when it governs the entire nation, as  \nopposed to when it governs some lesser subset of regu-\nlated parties, States, or regions. \nb. In the context of the RFS program, the CAA  \nauthorizes EPA to take some national actions and some \nlocal actions. For example: When EPA publishes annual \n \n8  See Texas 2016, 829 F.3d at 418; Dalton Trucking, Inc. v. \nEPA, 808 F.3d 875, 879 (D.C. Cir. 2015); Clean Water Action \nCouncil of Ne. Wis., Inc. v. EPA, 765 F.3d 749, 751 (7th Cir. \n2014). \n\n \n30 \nrenewable-fuel blending-volume obligations for the indus-\ntry, that is a nationally applicable action, and any chal-\nlenge to it goes to the D.C. Circuit. See, e.g., Americans \nfor Clean Energy v. EPA, 864 F.3d 691 (D.C. Cir. 2017). \nThat\u2019s because EPA\u2019s volumes rule affects every RFS-\nobligated party in the nation.  \nBut when EPA decides a small refinery\u2019s RFS hard-\nship petition, that is a \u201cquintessentially local action,\u201d as \nEPA itself has previously (correctly) put it. EPA Motion \n18, Advanced Biofuels, No. 18-1115, supra. Hardship  \ndecisions look nothing like the national actions enumer-\nated in Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s first sentence, but they closely \nresemble the individualized decisions enumerated in the \nsecond sentence. Hardship decisions do not regulate the \nwhole nation or industry; they \u201cinvolve only the regulation \nof \u201d individual facilities\u2019 requests for relief and \u201chave legal \nconsequences only for [those] facilities.\u201d Texas 2023, 2023 \nWL 7204840, at *5; see West Virginia Chamber of Com-\nmerce v. Browner, 166 F.3d 336 (4th Cir. 1998) (finding it \n\u201cclearly regionally applicable\u201d \u201cwhen the EPA \u2026 makes \na determination with respect to a particular facility\u201d). \nAs EPA has previously explained: Each of the small-\nrefinery respondents\u2019 hardship petitions \u201conly requested \nrelief for one refinery.\u201d EPA Reply in Support of Motion \nto Dismiss 2, Lion Oil Co. v. EPA, No. 14-3405, Dkt. \n4227218 (8th Cir. Dec. 17, 2014). And each denial action \nwas a \u201cdecision with respect to a particular small refin-\nery\u2019s request\u201d that \u201cadjudicates legal rights as to that sin-\ngle refinery in its single location.\u201d U.S. Br. 15, Producers \nof Renewables United for Integrity Truth and Transpar-\nency v. EPA (\u201cPRUITT\u201d), No. 18-1202, Dkt. 1775897 \n(D.C. Cir. Mar. 4, 2019). \nThat is why EPA has repeatedly argued that RFS \nhardship decisions are locally applicable for Section \n\n \n31 \n7607(b)(1), before EPA began attempting to manufacture \nvenue in the D.C. Circuit by bundling decisions together. \nE.g., PRUITT, No. 18-1202, supra; EPA Response 2,  \nRenewable Fuels Ass\u2019n v. EPA, No. 18-9533, Dkt. 35 (10th \nCir. July 12, 2018) (\u201cvenue is proper in this Court\u201d); U.S. \nBr. 2-3, Ergon-West Virginia, Inc. v. EPA, Nos. 19-2128, \n19-2148, 19-2152 (consol.), Dkt. 64 (4th Cir. May 28, 2020) \n(challenge to denied hardship petition \u201cproperly venued\u201d \nin Fourth Circuit \u201cbecause the action is locally or region-\nally applicable\u201d). \n3. EPA\u2019s actions were based on local economic facts, \nnot any nationwide statutory determination. \na. Because EPA\u2019s denials of respondents\u2019 RFS hard-\nship petitions are \u201clocally or regionally applicable ac-\ntion[s],\u201d the text of Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s third sentence \npresumptively \u201crequires review in th[e] [regional] cir-\ncuit.\u201d Texas 2016, 829 F.3d at 424; see Kentucky, 2023 WL \n11871967, at *3. EPA can overcome that presumption only \nby demonstrating that its denials were \u201cbased on a deter-\nmination of nationwide scope or effect.\u201d \u00a7 7607(b)(1); see \npp. 8-10, supra. \nThe courts of appeals broadly agree that the scope and \neffect of EPA\u2019s determinations are reviewed \u201cde novo\u201d \nand without deference to the agency. Texas 2016, 829 F.3d \nat 421 (5th Cir.); see Sierra Club, 47 F.4th at 746 (D.C. \nCir.); Dalton Trucking, Inc. v. EPA, 808 F.3d 875, 881 \n(D.C. Cir. 2015). The third-sentence exception applies \nonly \u201cif [the] action is based on a determination of nation-\nwide scope or effect and if in taking such action the Ad-\nministrator finds and publishes that such action is based \non such a determination.\u201d \u00a7 7607(b)(1) (emphases added). \nIt does not suffice for EPA to find and publish a nation-\nwide-effect conclusion; the action must actually be based \non a determination of nationwide scope or effect and EPA \n\n \n32 \nmust publish that finding. The first of those independent \n\u201ctwo conditions\u201d (unlike the second) makes no reference \nto what EPA finds or publishes, so it is a legal question for \nthe courts. Texas 2016, 829 F.3d at 421; see Sierra Club, \n47 F.4th at 746; see also Loper Bright Enterprises v. Rai-\nmondo, 603 U.S. 369 (2024). \nBoth the text and history of Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s third \nsentence show that, to trigger the exception, the relevant \nsubstantive CAA provision must textually direct EPA to \nmake a \u201cdetermination\u201d for the entire nation\u2014i.e., the \nkind of determination that does not depend on individual \ncircumstances. See pp. 8-9, supra. That was the kind of \nstatutory determination identified by EPA General Coun-\nsel Frick that the government agrees (U.S. Br. 18) \nprompted Congress to add the third sentence to Section \n7607(b)(1). And the government further agrees (U.S. Br. \n31) that Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s \u201cbased on\u201d formulation means \nthe relevant EPA determination cannot be \u201cperipheral or \nextraneous\u201d but must \u201clie at the core of the agency  \naction.\u201d Texas 2016, 829 F.3d at 419. \nThe CAA is littered with provisions requiring \u201cdeter-\nminations\u201d as the basis for final actions. In fact, more than \nhalf of the CAA\u2019s sections call for at least one determina-\ntion before EPA can act. See generally 42 U.S.C. Ch. 85. \nCongress\u2019s repeated use of the term \u201cdetermination\u201d or \nits derivatives throughout the Act indicates it is a term of \nart with the same meaning in Section 7607(b)(1). See  \nMohamad v. Palestinian Auth., 566 U.S. 449, 456 (2012). \nSo courts do not apply Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s third sentence \nby asking generally about the inputs or processes for an \nEPA action; they look to whether the statutory text called \nfor taking that action on the basis of a specific kind of  \ndetermination. See Kentucky, 123 F.4th at 463-464 (\u201cWhen \nused to describe a ruling from an \u2018administrative agency,\u2019 \n\n \n33 \n\u2018determination\u2019 has a more precise \u2018legal meaning\u2019 \u201d that \ndoes \u201cnot\u201d refer to \u201ceach preliminary step on the road to \n[the agency\u2019s] decision.\u201d) (citation omitted). \nb. EPA\u2019s denials of the small-refinery respondents\u2019 \nhardship petitions were not based on any statutory deter-\nminations of nationwide scope or effect.  \ni. That is so, first, because the relevant CAA provi-\nsion here (\u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)) does not call for any determi-\nnation at all. Unlike the immediately preceding subsection \nand other subsections within the same section, subsection \n7545(o)(9)(B) does not use the phrase \u201cdetermination\u201d or \n\u201cdetermines.\u201d It instead invites a small refinery to peti-\ntion for relief \u201cfor the reason of disproportionate economic \nhardship,\u201d and it says that EPA should \u201cevaluat[e]\u201d that \nhardship petition in consultation with DOE after consid-\nering DOE\u2019s 2011 study and \u201cother economic factors.\u201d \nThere are no statutory \u201cdetermination[s]\u201d in that process. \nTo the extent Section 7545(o)(9)(B) contemplates any \nstatutory determination at all, it calls for a determination \nthat has a local scope and effect. After the blanket RFS \nexemption for small refineries ended in 2011, Congress  \ndirected EPA to extend an exemption for at least two \nmore years \u201c[i]n the case of a small refinery that the Sec-\nretary of Energy determines \u2026 would be subject to a dis-\nproportionate economic hardship if required to comply \nwith\u201d the RFS. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(A)(ii)(II) (emphases added). \nNo longer did all small refineries nationwide get the  \nexemption; only those specific small refineries that were  \ndetermined to face disproportionate economic hardship. \nThat provision required EPA to grant exemptions based \non DOE\u2019s local determination that a particular small  \nrefinery would face hardship. \n \n\n \n34 \nCongress then provided in the very next subsection\u2014\nthe one at issue here\u2014that \u201c[a] small refinery may at any \ntime petition [EPA] for an extension of the exemption  \nunder subparagraph (A) for the reason of disproportion-\nate economic hardship.\u201d \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(i). The reference \nback to \u201csubparagraph (A)\u201d indicates that, when EPA \nconsiders a small refinery\u2019s hardship petition, it must \nmake the same individualized hardship determinations \nthat drove the earlier regime. \nThe plain text of \u201cth[e] chapter\u201d thus compels EPA\u2019s \nhardship decisions to be \u201cbased on\u201d an economic analysis \nfor \u201ca\u201d petitioning small refinery that is local in scope and \neffect. \u00a7 7607(b)(1); \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(i). EPA has said the \nsame thing: the Act \u201cgive[s] EPA the authority to grant \n[a hardship] petition only when a small refinery demon-\nstrates it is experiencing [hardship] caused by compliance \nwith the RFS program.\u201d Pet.App.185a. That must be the \ncore basis for any final action on a hardship petition. \nii. Moreover, the record here shows that EPA in fact \nbased its final actions denying hardship relief on just such \nindividualized conclusions. EPA explained that it had \n\u201ccompleted a thorough evaluation of the data and infor-\nmation provided in the [hardship] petitions, supplemental \nsubmissions, and comments to determine if any of the  \npetitioners have demonstrated that the cost of compliance \nwith the RFS is the cause of their alleged [hardship].\u201d \nPet.App.94a-95a. EPA then found \u201cthat none of the\u201d \npending petitions had \u201cdemonstrated [hardship] caused \nby the cost of compliance with the requirements of the \nRFS program.\u201d Pet.App.185a; accord U.S. Br. 10 (\u201cEPA  \ndetermined that none of the petitioning small refineries \nhad rebutted [the RIN-cost-passthrough] presumption \nthrough evidence about their specific circumstances.\u201d). \n\n \n35 \nTo be sure, EPA had hypothesized in the proposed  \ndenials, before its final actions, that no small refinery \nwould suffer hardship from the RFS because each could \nfully pass through its RIN costs. But that was merely a \nhypothesis. EPA called it then an \u201ceconomic theory,\u201d \nPet.App.212a n.42, 251a; and calls it now (U.S. Br. 8) a \u201cre-\nbuttable presumption.\u201d Whatever it\u2019s called, for EPA to \ntest its hypothesis\u2014to move beyond theory and produce \nfinal agency action on the hardship petitions\u2014EPA con-\ncedes that it needed to, and did, \u201ccarefully review[ ] data, \n[fuel-sales] contracts, and other information from small \nrefineries.\u201d Pet.App.98a-99a. It was only then that EPA \nconcluded (erroneously) that each small refinery actually \n\u201cis recovering its [RFS compliance] costs,\u201d e.g., JA 280, \n286, 298, and for that reason does not face economic hard-\nship, Pet.App.100a. \n* \nBoth the statutory text and record confirm that EPA \ntook these final actions \u201cbased on\u201d conclusions that none \nof the small-refinery respondents would experience  \ndisproportionate economic hardship from the RFS. \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1). Even if those conclusions could qualify as \n\u201cdeterminations\u201d at all, they were local determinations \nbased on an analysis of each refinery\u2019s local evidence, not \nany \u201cdetermination of nationwide scope or effect.\u201d Ibid. \nB. EPA\u2019s arguments seeking D.C. Circuit review fail. \nDespite EPA\u2019s longtime position that its final actions \non hardship petitions are reviewable only in the regional \ncircuit courts, EPA now argues that these denial decisions \nwere nationally applicable, or else were based on a deter-\nmination of nationwide scope or effect. EPA is wrong on \nboth points. \n\n \n36 \n1. EPA gets the \u201caction\u201d wrong. \nEPA does not attempt to argue that its individual \nhardship-petition decisions\u2014as opposed to its bundled  \nexplanations in the April and June Denials of its reasons \nfor denying those petitions\u2014were nationally applicable. \nEPA\u2019s argument thus hangs on this Court being willing to \ncredit its assertion that it produced just two final actions. \nBut the statute shows EPA is wrong about that. It is the \nchapter\u2019s text, not EPA, that establishes what qualifies as \nthe relevant \u201caction\u201d \u201cunder\u201d the CAA. Texas 2023, 2023 \nWL 7204840, at *4. \na. EPA\u2019s brief offers no real attempt to analyze the \nfirst critical phrase in Section 7607(b)(1): \u201cfinal action \u2026 \nunder this chapter.\u201d The government says (U.S. Br. 28-\n29) all that matters is \u201cEPA\u2019s characterization of its own \nagency action\u201d and that courts may not \u201csecond-guess \nEPA\u2019s own framing.\u201d But all agree it is the nature of the \nadministrative action that matters for venue. See pp. 22-\n23, supra. And nothing in the statute gives EPA the power \nto alter the nature of administrative actions just by choos-\ning how to publish those actions (grouped together vs.  \nindividual announcements). EPA\u2019s argument calls back to \nan era before this Court held squarely that \u201ccourts, not \nagencies,\u201d determine \u201cthe meaning of statutory provi-\nsions.\u201d Loper Bright, 603 U.S. at 392, 394. \nThe Sixth Circuit recently explained why it rejected \nthe same argument advanced by the government here: \nthat EPA\u2019s choice of framing, rather than the statutory \ntext, controls what counts as the final action. See Ken-\ntucky, 123 F.4th at 460-463. \u201cThe \u2018structure\u2019 of the judicial-\nreview provision \u2026 focuses on the statute\u201d\u2014not on how \nEPA chose to report its decisions\u2014\u201cto distinguish the \nEPA actions that parties must challenge in the D.C. Cir-\ncuit from those they must challenge in regional circuits.\u201d \n\n \n37 \nId. at 461 (quoting Engine Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. South Coast Air \nQuality Mgmt. Dist., 541 U.S. 246, 252 (2004)). Congress\u2019s \nown designation in Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s first two sen-\ntences of enumerated actions as either nationally applica-\nble or locally applicable, combined with catchall phrases \nfor each sentence, indicates it is the Act, not EPA, that \ngives an action its nature. See ibid. \nEPA\u2019s invocation (U.S. Br. 28) of \u201cthe face of the final \naction\u201d does not advance the analysis. \u201cTh[at] argument \nconflates the [explanation] issued\u201d for EPA\u2019s hardship-\ndenial decisions \u201cwith the \u2018final action\u2019 that the EPA \ntakes.\u201d Kentucky, 123 F.4th at 462 (quoting \u00a7 7607(b)(1)). \nSmall-refinery respondents\u2019 position does not depend on \nthe contents of any petitioner\u2019s court challenge to the \nEPA action or on downstream effects. Venue depends,  \ninstead, on whether the text of the chapter shows the chal-\nlenged action on its face to be more like Section \n7607(b)(1)\u2019s enumerated nationally applicable actions \n(governing the whole nation) or more like the enumerated \nlocally applicable actions that resolve individual parties\u2019 \nrights or obligations. \nb. None of that calls into question EPA\u2019s \u201cfree[dom] \nto fashion [its] own rules of procedure,\u201d including \n\u201c \u2018whether applications should be heard contemporane-\nously or successively.\u2019 \u201d U.S. Br. 26-27 (quoting FCC v. \nPottsville Broad. Co., 309 U.S. 134, 138 (1940)). That free-\ndom includes the \u201cprocess\u201d for taking action; for example, \nthe freedom (where the law permits) to choose between \n\u201crulemaking, individual adjudication, or a combination of \nthe two.\u201d NAACP v. Federal Power Comm\u2019n, 425 U.S. \n662, 668 (1976). EPA could have conducted a rulemaking \nto establish a new interpretation of Section 7545(o)(9)(B) \nand new adjudicatory framework, and such a rule would \nlikely have been nationally applicable. But a new rule like \n\n \n38 \nthat would have needed to be prospective only, see p. 15, \nsupra, which did not meet EPA\u2019s goal here to issue long-\noverdue decisions denying previously submitted small- \nrefinery hardship petitions from prior years.  \nRespondents\u2019 position thus does not disturb EPA\u2019s \nchoice whether to proceed by rulemaking versus adjudi-\ncation. EPA will retain flexibility in running its future \nhardship decisionmaking processes, so long as it examines \neach small refinery\u2019s evidence and adheres to the statu-\ntory decision deadline for final action on each petition. \nWhat EPA may not do is what it attempted here: disre-\ngard whether the CAA\u2019s text calls for local rather than \nnational action. Contrary to EPA\u2019s assertion (U.S. Br. \n26-27), respondents\u2019 textual analysis does not rely merely \non \u201can indefinite article.\u201d As described above (pp. 24-27,  \nsupra), every relevant part of the text and structure of \nSection 7545(o)(9) confirms that Congress wanted RFS \nhardship decisions to be individualized. Cf. Kentucky, 123 \nF.4th at 461 (\u201cthe disapproval of each state plan qualifies \nas a distinct \u2018action\u2019 \u201d). \n2. EPA fails to establish that the hardship decisions \nare nationally applicable. \nWith EPA\u2019s misidentification of the relevant final  \naction corrected, the errors in its remaining arguments \nbecome clear. EPA\u2019s April and June 2022 explanation doc-\numents asserted that the agency had taken nationally  \napplicable actions for two reasons. First, EPA announced \ntogether the denial of hardship petitions submitted by  \nrefineries located in different circuits. Pet.App.185a-188a \n(June 2022 announcement: \u201cThis final action denies 69  \npetitions \u2026 for over 30 small refineries across the coun-\ntry[.]\u201d); Pet.App.327a-330a (similar for April 2022 an-\nnouncement). Second, EPA applied its new statutory \ninterpretation and new economic passthrough hypothesis \n\n \n39 \nto all hardship petitions that the agency adjudicated. E.g., \nPet.App.187a-188a (\u201cEPA\u2019s revised interpretation of the \nrelevant CAA provisions and the RIN discount and RIN \ncost passthrough principles \u2026 are applicable to all small \nrefineries.\u201d). \na. Although EPA defended the second venue argu-\nment in its certiorari petition, U.S. Pet. 10 (arguing that \nthe Denials \u201care \u2018nationally applicable\u2019 because they apply \na uniform methodology to small refineries\u201d), it has now \nabandoned it, making only the geographic argument here. \nU.S. Br. 19-24. Rightly so. Looking to the legal standard \nor reasoning applied would contradict EPA\u2019s long-held \nposition\u2014accepted by multiple courts of appeals\u2014that \nonly \u201cthe face\u201d of the challenged action matters for venue, \nnot the action\u2019s reasoning or effects. See p. 28, supra.9 \nb. EPA\u2019s argument that the actions here were nation-\nally applicable because of geography rests on two errone-\nous premises. First, as discussed just above in Part B.1, it \nwrongly assumes the relevant \u201cactions\u201d are the two docu-\nments explaining EPA\u2019s reasons for denying 105 individ-\nually submitted hardship petitions. \u201c[T]hrow[ing] a \nblanket labeled \u2018national\u2019 over [105] individual decisions\u201d \ndoes not \u201cconvert\u201d them \u201cinto \u2026 national one[s].\u201d West \nVirginia, 90 F.4th at 330. That is especially so when EPA \n \n9  Biofuel respondents\u2019 argument (at Br. 36) that \u201csmall- \nrefinery exemption decisions\u201d are \u201cinherently nationally appli-\ncable\u201d because they affect \u201cthe amount of renewable fuel that \nobligated parties must inject into the nation\u2019s transportation-\nfuel supply\u201d fails for the same reason. The \u201capplicability\u201d in-\nquiry is unconcerned with the \u201cpractical effects\u201d of the EPA \naction. American Road, 705 F.3d at 456 (Kavanaugh, J.). Espe-\ncially a downstream issue like whether EPA chooses to adjust \nvolume obligations for other parties based on outcomes of small \nrefineries\u2019 hardship petitions. \n\n \n40 \nwas able to get all of these individual decisions under its \npurportedly \u201cnational\u201d blanket only by refusing to follow \nthe CAA\u2019s 90-day deadline for answering the hardship  \npetitions. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(B)(iii). Courts generally \u201cwill not \nsuffer a party to profit by his own wrongdoing.\u201d United \nStates v. Houlihan, 92 F.3d 1271, 1279 (1st Cir. 1996). And \nthe government \u201cshould turn square corners in dealing \nwith the people.\u201d Department of Homeland Sec. v.  \nRegents of the Univ. of California, 591 U.S. 1, 24 (2020)  \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \nSecond, EPA now reads the statutory phrase \u201cthe  \nappropriate circuit\u201d to mean that \u201cany action that spans \nmore than one judicial circuit is properly viewed as \u2018na-\ntionally applicable\u2019 and subject to review only in the D.C. \nCircuit.\u201d U.S. Br. 21-22 (quoting \u00a7 7607(b)(1)). According \nto the government (U.S. Br. 21), \u201c[t]he statute\u2019s use of the \ndefinite article \u2026 indicates that, for any given locally or \nregionally applicable EPA action, there is only one appro-\npriate regional court of appeals in which to seek review.\u201d \nThat reading is incorrect. \nNothing in Section 7607(b)(1) indicates that the phrase \n\u201cthe appropriate circuit\u201d informs the meaning of \u201cnation-\nally applicable,\u201d and the plain meaning of \u201cnationally  \napplicable\u201d contradicts EPA\u2019s reading. \u201cNationally\u201d \nmeans \u201cwith regard to the nation as a whole.\u201d Nationally, \nTHE OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY (1971); see Ken-\ntucky, 123 F.4th at 459 (same). Yet on EPA\u2019s reading, an \naction applying to far less than the whole nation\u2014say, one \napplying only to Mississippi and Alabama\u2014would be  \n\u201cnationally applicable.\u201d That is a stretch, to say the least. \nEven accepting arguendo EPA\u2019s view of the relevant \nfinal action, the April and June 2022 Denials were not \u201cna-\ntionally applicable\u201d because they did not cover the whole \nnation like the enumerated actions in Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s \n\n \n41 \nfirst sentence do. They applied to (and bound) only those \nsmall refineries that petitioned for an exemption. See \nPet.App.11a-12a.  \nThe ordinary meaning of \u201cregionally applicable\u201d also \nrebuts EPA\u2019s proffered reading, because that term con-\ntemplates agency actions applying in multiple places \nwithin a region: \u201cof or pertaining to, or connected with, a \nparticular region.\u201d Regional, THE OXFORD ENGLISH \nDICTIONARY (1971). Indeed, EPA\u2019s attempt to put so \nmuch weight on a single definite article produces textually \nabsurd results. Consider EPA\u2019s 250 air quality control  \nregions, some of which cover large metropolitan areas \nthat happen to cross State (and circuit) lines.10 \u201cMetropol-\nitan St. Louis\u201d (Region 70) and \u201cMetropolitan Kansas City\u201d \n(Region 90) are two examples. Can there be any doubt \nthat an EPA disapproval of a regional implementation \nplan for only Region 90 (Metropolitan Kansas City) is a \n\u201cregionally applicable\u201d action for purposes of Section \n7607(b)(1), even though that action touches both the \nEighth and Tenth Circuits? \nCongress did not think so. The 1970 Senate Report  \ninvoked by the government (U.S. Br. 23) said that \u201cimple-\nmentation plans which run only to one air quality control \nregion\u201d should be reviewed in the circuit court \u201cin which \nthe affected air quality control region, or portion thereof, \nis located.\u201d S. Rep. No. 1196, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 41 (1970) \n(emphasis added). Yet according to the government (U.S. \nBr. 22), the circuit courts governing the States affected by \na Kansas City regional action are powerless because \u201cany \naction that spans more than one judicial circuit\u201d must go \nexclusively to the D.C. Circuit. \n \n10 \nSee \nhttps://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/documents/codeta-\nbles/aqcrs.html. \n\n \n42 \nThe Senate Report supports what ordinary usage sug-\ngests about the meaning of \u201cthe appropriate circuit.\u201d \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1) (emphasis added). The use of \u201cthe appropri-\nate circuit\u201d rather than \u201cthe appropriate circuit(s)\u201d re-\nflects merely that Congress often doesn\u2019t legislate with \nlaser-like precision. E.g., United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. \n336, 344 (1971) (\u201cwe cannot pretend that all statutes are \nmodel statutes\u201d). For most EPA final actions (properly \nidentified), it will be readily apparent whether the action \napplies to the whole nation or to some subset\u2014and in the \nlatter instance, which circuit court is \u201cappropriate.\u201d That \nis certainly true for EPA\u2019s RFS hardship decisions, which \naffect only individual small refineries. \nc. Taken together, EPA\u2019s arguments reveal the \nagency\u2019s conscious desire for the power to choose where \nits actions are reviewed. EPA says (U.S. Br. 28-29) that \n\u201caction \u2026 under this chapter\u201d means its own \u201ccharacteri-\nzation\u201d of an action, which courts cannot \u201csecond-guess.\u201d \nAnd EPA further says (U.S. Br. 22) that any time an  \naction affects states or parties in more than one circuit, it \nis automatically entitled to D.C. Circuit review. If EPA \nwere right about both, then the agency could nearly al-\nways manufacture venue in the D.C. Circuit. EPA could \nsimply mush together two small refineries\u2019 RFS hardship \ndecisions, or decisions on two States\u2019 implementation \nplans\u2014even two decisions that have nothing to do with \neach other\u2014and thereby deny the regulated parties the \nopportunity for review by a regional circuit court. \nThe text of Section 7607(b)(1) does not allow that  \nmanipulation. \u201c[V]enue provisions in Acts of Congress \nshould not be so freely construed as to give the Govern-\nment the choice of \u2018a tribunal favorable\u2019 to it.\u201d Travis v. \nUnited States, 364 U.S. 631, 634 (1961) (citation omitted). \n\n \n43 \n3. The hardship decisions were not based on a \ndetermination of nationwide scope or effect. \nEPA asserts (U.S. Br. 33-35) that its individual denial \ndecisions were based on two determinations of nationwide \nscope or effect: \u201cEPA\u2019s revised interpretation of the rele-\nvant CAA provisions and the RIN discount and RIN cost \npassthrough principles.\u201d Pet.App.187a-188a. That mis-\ncharacterizes both the statutory text and the final actions. \na. As an initial matter, neither EPA\u2019s statutory inter-\npretation nor its economic hypothesis was a statutory  \n\u201cdetermination\u201d as the CAA uses that term of art. See pp. \n32-34, supra. Neither describes any issue that the CAA\u2019s \ntext directed EPA to \u201cdetermine\u201d before acting on a small  \nrefinery\u2019s RFS hardship petition. See \u00a7 7545(o)(9).  \nIn the immediately preceding subsection, Congress  \ninstructed EPA to extend two-year hardship exemptions \nbased on DOE\u2019s \u201cdetermin[ation]\u201d about a small refin-\nery\u2019s hardship. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(A)(ii)(II). And elsewhere in \nthe same Section, Congress authorized EPA to grant cer-\ntain waivers, following consultation with DOE, \u201cbased on \na determination by the Administrator \u2026 that implemen-\ntation of the requirement would severely harm the econ-\nomy or environment of a State, a region, or the United \nStates.\u201d \u00a7 7545(o)(7)(A)(i).  \nCongress thus knows how to make actions \u201cbased on a \ndetermination\u201d when it wants to. It did not do that for \nsmall-refinery hardship petitions in Section 7545(o)(9)(B). \nEPA\u2019s position wrongly depends on treating \u201cdetermina-\ntion\u201d in Section 7607(b)(1) not as a statutory term of art \nbut rather as some amorphous concept of anything that \ncontributed significantly to a final action.  \nb. Even if Section 7607(b)(1) used \u201cdetermination\u201d in \nthe colloquial sense, EPA would still be wrong about the \nbasis for these hardship-petition denial actions. \n\n \n44 \ni. EPA\u2019s first suggestion\u2014that a statutory interpre-\ntation can qualify as a \u201cdetermination of nationwide scope \nor effect\u201d\u2014is nothing less than an argument that every \nEPA action must go to the D.C. Circuit. EPA is a \u201ccrea-\nture[ ] of statute,\u201d so \u201cit possess[es] only the authority that \nCongress has provided.\u201d National Fed\u2019n of Indep. Bus. v. \nDep\u2019t of Lab., Occupational Safety & Health Admin., 595 \nU.S. 109, 117, (2022). Every EPA action is necessarily \n\u201cbased on\u201d the agency\u2019s understanding of its statutory  \nauthority. \nIt similarly cannot be the case (contra U.S. Br. 34) that \nEPA\u2019s denial actions here were based on a nationwide  \ndetermination because EPA applied a statutory interpre-\ntation \u201cuniformly\u201d to them. If EPA had not done that\u2014if \nit had applied a different statutory reading to similarly \nsituated small-refinery petitioners\u2014that would be the \nheight of arbitrariness. So \u201cif application of a national \nstandard \u2026 were the controlling factor, there never could \nbe a local or regional action\u201d because every EPA action \n\u201cpurportedly applies a national standard created by the \nnational statute and its national regulations.\u201d West Vir-\nginia, 90 F.4th at 329-330. This Court should not read the \nnarrow nationwide-scope-or-effect exception to \u201cswallow \nthe\u201d local-or-regionally-applicable rule. Cuomo v. Clear-\ning House Ass\u2019n, L.L.C., 557 U.S. 519, 530 (2009). \nThe most obvious examples of locally applicable  \nactions involve EPA applying a uniform statutory stand-\nard to individual regulated parties\u2019 factual circumstances. \nAccord U.S. Br. 42. Acknowledging that reality, EPA  \nultimately abandons any argument based on application \nof a \u201cuniform\u201d standard, conceding (U.S. Br. 41) that EPA \n\u201cdoes not\u201d make a nationwide-scope determination \u201cwhen \nit merely applies a previously established agency \u2026 inter-\npretation to new \u2018locally or regionally applicable\u2019 circum-\n\n \n45 \nstances.\u201d That describes what EPA did in the final actions \nchallenged here: It applied its statutory interpretation to \neach petitioning small refinery\u2019s evidence about its local \neconomic circumstances. See pp. 34-35, supra. \nInsofar as EPA contends (U.S. Br. 33, 41) that what \nmatters here is that it promulgated its \u201cnew interpreta-\ntion\u201d at \u201croughly the same time\u201d it denied the hardship \npetitions, that argument does not rebut the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \nvenue conclusion. For one thing, that argument would not \nextend to the June 2022 Denial decisions, which merely \napplied the statutory interpretation that EPA had an-\nnounced months earlier in April. Pet.App.80a.11 \nIn any event, EPA\u2019s choice to offer a new statutory \nanalysis cannot alter what determination the statute  \nrequired as the basis for every small-refinery hardship \ndecision. The text does not ask whether the agency made \nsome determination of nationwide scope or effect in con-\nnection with the action. It asks whether EPA \u201cbased\u201d its \nfinal action on such a determination. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). Here, as \nexplained above, the basis for these final actions must by \nlaw be findings about the individual petitioning small  \n \n11  Despite EPA repeatedly referring to the April and June \nDenials as two separate actions, EPA simultaneously argues \nthat those explanation documents should be treated as one for \npurposes of establishing its new adjudication approach to hard-\nship petitions. U.S. Br. 42-43 n.6. EPA urges this Court (ibid.) \nto disregard the \u201ctime that passed between the[ir] finalization\u201d \nbecause \u201c[b]oth denial actions here stemmed from a single \npropos[al].\u201d But obviously one proposal can lead ultimately to \nmultiple final actions. And according to the face of the June  \nexplanation document, it was only the April explanation docu-\nment that broke new ground: \u201cIn this action, EPA is applying \nthe approach proposed on December 7, 2021, and adopted in \nthe April 2022 [RFS] Denial.\u201d Pet.App.80a (emphases added). \n\n \n46 \nrefineries\u2019 economic circumstances. And EPA has admit-\nted that these hardship decisions were based on just that. \nSee p. 34, supra. \nMoreover, EPA\u2019s new statutory interpretation was \nnot sufficient to produce final agency action in this con-\ntext. Recall that EPA could not, and did not, use a rule-\nmaking for its new interpretation\u2014because to do so here \nwould plainly have been illegally retroactive. If EPA had \nwanted judicial review to focus on its new statutory inter-\npretation (U.S. Br. 42), it could have run a (lawful) rule-\nmaking process. But EPA expressly chose to proceed only \nby adjudication. See Pet.App.188 (\u201cThis action is not a \nrulemaking\u201d). That choice meant that EPA could produce \n\u201cfinal action \u2026 under this chapter\u201d not by analyzing the \nstatute but rather only by evaluating the petitioning small \nrefineries\u2019 economic evidence. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). \nIt is also no answer for EPA to contend (U.S. Br. 35, \n42) that a case must go to the D.C. Circuit when \u201ccircum-\nstances suggest\u201d that EPA\u2019s statutory interpretation is \n\u201clikely to be called into question\u201d in the litigation. That \nflies in the face of the courts\u2019 consistent holding (and \nEPA\u2019s consistent position) that what matters is EPA\u2019s  \n\u201cfinal action,\u201d not the petitioner\u2019s arguments challenging \nit. See pp. 7-8, supra. It will not always be apparent at the \noutset of litigation, when venue is typically (and most effi-\nciently) resolved, what aspects of an EPA action will be \ncalled into question. \nThe better answer is the simpler one that also gives \nthe statutory terms their ordinary meaning: An EPA  \naction is based on a determination of nationwide scope or \neffect in the rare instance when the CAA\u2019s text directs \nEPA to make a factual \u201cdetermination\u201d about the entire \nnation or industry, without the need to consider individual \ncircumstances. \n\n \n47 \nii. For many of the same reasons, EPA\u2019s RIN-cost-\npassthrough hypothesis did not make these hardship  \ndenial actions based on a determination of nationwide \nscope or effect. Even if EPA\u2019s passthrough hypothesis \ncould qualify as a \u201cdetermination\u201d under the statute when \nthe text does not describe it that way, see pp. 33-34, supra, \nthe actions denying the hardship petitions were not \n\u201cbased on\u201d it, \u00a7 7607(b)(1). EPA had merely a hypothe-\nsis\u2014an \u201canalysis of how\u201d EPA \u201cexpected\u201d individual fuels \nmarkets to respond, Pet.App.163a-165a\u2014that EPA \nneeded to test, and did test, against each hardship peti-\ntion\u2019s evidence. See pp. 34-35, supra. Only that analysis of \neach refinery\u2019s individual evidence could be the \u201cbas[is]\u201d \nfor \u201cfinal action[s]\u201d denying respondents\u2019 hardship peti-\ntions. \u00a7 7607(b)(1) (emphasis added). \nEPA\u2019s actions were not \u201cbased on\u201d any supposedly  \nnationwide RIN-cost-passthrough determination for the \nadditional reason that, with or without any nationwide  \nassessment, EPA\u2019s denial actions here would have been \nexactly the same. The government agrees (U.S. Br. 41) \nthat the textual \u201ccausation requirement\u201d in Section \n7607(b)(1) means that \u201cthe relevant determinations\u201d must \nbe \u201cat the core of EPA\u2019s action.\u201d But here, EPA did not \nneed any nationwide finding about any other refineries to \nconclude, as it wrongly did in the denial actions, that each \nof the small-refinery respondents were \u201cable to pass along \nRFS compliance costs,\u201d were \u201crecovering [their] costs,\u201d \nand so were suffering \u201cno economic harm.\u201d Pet.App.99a-\n100a, 165a; JA 280.  \nIn short, the conclusion that drove each denial decision \nwas not that all obligated parties recover their RFS costs; \nit was that each of these respondents (purportedly) does. \nAs EPA itself explains (U.S. Br. 10): It denied respond-\nents\u2019 hardship petitions because it \u201cdetermined that none \n\n \n48 \nof the petitioning small refineries had rebutted [the RIN-\ncost-passthrough] presumption through evidence about \ntheir specific circumstances.\u201d Those were conclusions \nabout specific refineries, not nationwide determinations.12 \nc. EPA invokes the history (U.S. Br. 35-38) of the \nthird-sentence exception in Section 7607(b)(1), but that \nhistory actually undermines EPA\u2019s position. As recounted \nabove, the exception was prompted by General Counsel \nFrick\u2019s description of an atypical CAA provision that, \nthough calling for a local action (an extension for specific \nStates), textually required EPA\u2019s action to be based on a \ndetermination about technology available throughout the \nindustry. See pp. 8-9, supra. That extension action did not \nrequire or even contemplate any consideration of individ-\nualized State circumstances; EPA was tasked instead \nwith making a finding about the technology available \nthroughout the nation. \nEPA\u2019s actions on small-refinery hardship petitions \nlook nothing like that. The text of Section 7545(o)(9)(B), \nunlike the unusual provision that Frick described, does \nnot ask EPA to make any \u201cdetermination\u201d about the  \nentire nation or industry as a basis for granting hardship \nrelief. It does not call for any determination at all. To the \nextent it does, it calls for a determination about the indi-\nvidual petitioning small refinery\u2019s economic circum-\nstances. See pp. 33-34, supra. \nEPA responds by catastrophizing (U.S. Br. 38) that if \nthe denials here do not qualify as based on nationwide  \n \n12  EPA\u2019s footnoted discussion (U.S. Br. 34 n.5) of how it \nchooses to respond to granted hardship petitions is irrelevant \nto Section 7607(b)(1), because those downstream choices by the \nagency say nothing about what was the \u201cbas[is]\u201d for the final \ndenial actions here. \n\n \n49 \ndeterminations, then the third-sentence exception to Sec-\ntion 7607(b)(1) will be \u201cpractically insignificant.\u201d But the \nthird sentence was always meant to state an exception to \nthe general rule for locally applicable actions. General \nCounsel Frick urged the exception\u2019s adoption to address \na CAA provision that has since been repealed. That is \nlikely why, before the cases involving EPA\u2019s denial deci-\nsions here, no court had ever found a locally applicable \nEPA action that was based on a determination of nation-\nwide scope or effect. The exception is properly narrow. \nd. EPA concludes by resorting to a policy argument: \nIt asks this Court to read \u201cbased on a determination of  \nnationwide scope or effect\u201d broadly, on the theory that  \njudicial review will be more efficient if the D.C. Circuit \nalone considers issues like EPA\u2019s statutory analysis and \nmethodological framework.  \nAppeals to policy cannot supersede the ordinary \nmeaning of the terms in Section 7607(b)(1) or the confir-\nmation of their meaning in the statutory context and his-\ntory. Niz-Chavez v. Garland, 593 U.S. 155, 171 (2021) (\u201cno \namount of policy-talk can overcome a plain statutory com-\nmand\u201d). And in any event, EPA\u2019s policy argument falls \nflat. If EPA wants to propound a new statutory interpre-\ntation and have it reviewed by only the D.C. Circuit, then \nthe agency need only adopt that interpretation through a \nlawful rulemaking process. \nExperience has proven EPA wrong in suggesting that \nconsolidated D.C. Circuit review of CAA actions is always \nor usually best. The litigation here is a perfect example. \nBecause EPA persuaded several regional circuit courts to \ntransfer small refineries\u2019 challenges to their hardship- \ndenial decisions, the D.C. Circuit ended up hearing one \nmassive case consolidating dozens of small refineries\u2019  \npetitions for review. See p. 18, supra. That consolidation \n\n \n50 \nmade the D.C. Circuit litigation take much longer than \nother small refineries\u2019 regional-circuit challenges to \nEPA\u2019s denials of their hardship petitions.  \nEven more important, consolidation in the D.C. Cir-\ncuit made it very difficult for the individual small refiner-\nies to get judicial attention on what ultimately matters \nmost: their specific economic circumstances that give rise \nto their disproportionate economic hardship from the \nRFS. To take just one example: In the mass D.C. Circuit \nchallenge alongside dozens of co-petitioners, there was no \neasy way for a small refinery affiliated with one respond-\nent here, Calumet Montana, to ask the court to focus on \nthe idiosyncrasies of producing blended diesel fuel in a \ncold climate in winter. Yet that is exactly the sort of con-\ndition that causes Calumet Montana to face dispropor-\ntionate economic hardship from the RFS. \nEPA\u2019s preference for near-universal D.C. Circuit  \nreview would obscure the judiciary\u2019s consideration of  \nindividual regulated entities\u2019 circumstances, contrary to \nthe essential logic of Congress\u2019s plan for a national vs.  \nlocal divide in Section 7607(b)(1). \n\n \n51 \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be af-\nfirmed. \nRespectfully submitted, \nLeAnn M.

For the 50 and 60 percent reduc-\ntions, the Administrator may make such an adjust-\nment only if he determines that generally such reduc-\ntion is not commercially feasible for fuels made using \na variety of feedstocks, technologies, and processes to \nmeet the applicable reduction. \n(B) Amount of adjustment \nIn promulgating regulations under this paragraph, \nthe specified 50 percent reduction in greenhouse gas \nemissions from advanced biofuel and in biomass-based \ndiesel may not be reduced below 40 percent. The spec-\nified 20 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions \nfrom renewable fuel may not be reduced below 10 per-\ncent, and the specified 60 percent reduction in green-\nhouse gas emissions from cellulosic biofuel may not be \nreduced below 50 percent. \n(C) Adjusted reduction levels \nAn adjustment under this paragraph to a percent less \nthan the specified 20 percent greenhouse gas reduc-\ntion for renewable fuel shall be the minimum possible \nadjustment, and the adjusted greenhouse gas reduc-\ntion shall be established by the Administrator at the \nmaximum achievable level, taking cost in consider-\n\n14a \n \nation, for natural gas fired corn-based ethanol plants, \nallowing for the use of a variety of technologies and \nprocesses. An adjustment in the 50 or 60 percent \ngreenhouse gas levels shall be the minimum possible \nadjustment for the fuel or fuels concerned, and the ad-\njusted greenhouse gas reduction shall be established \nat the maximum achievable level, taking cost in con-\nsideration, allowing for the use of a variety of feed-\nstocks, technologies, and processes. \n(D) 5-year review \nWhenever the Administrator makes any adjustment \nunder this paragraph, not later than 5 years thereafter \nhe shall review and revise (based upon the same crite-\nria and standards as required for the initial adjust-\nment) the regulations establishing the adjusted level. \n(E) Subsequent adjustments \nAfter the Administrator has promulgated a final rule \nunder the last sentence of paragraph (2)(A)(i) with re-\nspect to the method of determining lifecycle green-\nhouse gas emissions, except as provided in subpara-\ngraph (D), the Administrator may not adjust the per-\ncent greenhouse gas reduction levels unless he deter-\nmines that there has been a significant change in the \nanalytical methodology used for determining the \nlifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. If he makes such \ndetermination, he may adjust the 20, 50, or 60 percent \nreduction levels through rulemaking using the criteria \nand standards set forth in this paragraph. \n(F) Limit on upward adjustments \nIf, under subparagraph (D) or (E), the Administrator \nrevises a percent level adjusted as provided in subpar-\nagraphs (A), (B), and (C) to a higher percent, such \nhigher percent may not exceed the applicable percent \n\n15a \n \nspecified in paragraph (2)(A)(i), (1)(D), (1)(B)(i), or \n(1)(E). \n(G) Applicability of adjustments \nIf the Administrator adjusts, or revises, a percent \nlevel referred to in this paragraph or makes a change \nin the analytical methodology used for determining \nthe lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions, such adjust-\nment, revision, or change (or any combination thereof) \nshall only apply to renewable fuel from new facilities \nthat commence construction after the effective date of \nsuch adjustment, revision, or change. \n(5) Credit program \n(A) In general \nThe regulations promulgated under paragraph (2)(A) \nshall provide\u2014 \n(i) for the generation of an appropriate amount of \ncredits by any person that refines, blends, or imports \ngasoline that contains a quantity of renewable fuel \nthat is greater than the quantity required under para-\ngraph (2); \n(ii) for the generation of an appropriate amount of \ncredits for biodiesel; and  \n(iii) for the generation of credits by small refiner-\nies in accordance with paragraph (9)(C). \n(B) Use of credits \nA person that generates credits under subparagraph \n(A) may use the credits, or transfer all or a portion of \nthe credits to another person, for the purpose of com-\nplying with paragraph (2). \n\n16a \n \n(C) Duration of credits \nA credit generated under this paragraph shall be valid \nto show compliance for the 12 months as of the date of \ngeneration. \n(D) Inability to generate or purchase sufficient \ncredits \nThe regulations promulgated under paragraph (2)(A) \nshall include provisions allowing any person that is un-\nable to generate or purchase sufficient credits to meet \nthe requirements of paragraph (2) to carry forward a \nrenewable fuel deficit on condition that the person, in \nthe calendar year following the year in which the re-\nnewable fuel deficit is created\u2014 \n(i) achieves compliance with the renewable fuel re-\nquirement under paragraph (2); and \n(ii) generates or purchases additional renewable \nfuel credits to offset the renewable fuel deficit of the \nprevious year. \n(E) Credits for additional renewable fuel \nThe Administrator may issue regulations providing: \n(i) for the generation of an appropriate amount of cred-\nits by any person that refines, blends, or imports addi-\ntional renewable fuels specified by the Administrator; \nand (ii) for the use of such credits by the generator, or \nthe transfer of all or a portion of the credits to another \nperson, for the purpose of complying with paragraph \n(2). \n(6) Seasonal variations in renewable fuel use \n(A) Study \nFor each of calendar years 2006 through 2012, the Ad-\nministrator of the Energy Information Administration \nshall conduct a study of renewable fuel blending to \n\n17a \n \ndetermine whether there are excessive seasonal vari-\nations in the use of renewable fuel. \n(B) Regulation of excessive seasonal variations \nIf, for any calendar year, the Administrator of the En-\nergy Information Administration, based on the study \nunder subparagraph (A), makes the determinations \nspecified in subparagraph (C), the Administrator of \nthe Environmental Protection Agency shall promul-\ngate regulations to ensure that 25 percent or more of \nthe quantity of renewable fuel necessary to meet the \nrequirements of paragraph (2) is used during each of \nthe 2 periods specified in subparagraph (D) of each \nsubsequent calendar year. \n(C) Determinations \nThe determinations referred to in subparagraph (B) \nare that\u2014 \n(i)  less than 25 percent of the quantity of renewa-\nble fuel necessary to meet the requirements of para-\ngraph (2) has been used during 1 of the 2 periods spec-\nified in subparagraph (D) of the calendar year; \n(ii)  a pattern of excessive seasonal variation de-\nscribed in clause (i) will continue in subsequent calen-\ndar years; and promulgating regulations or other re-\nquirements to impose a 25 percent or more seasonal \nuse of renewable fuels will not prevent or interfere \nwith the attainment of national ambient air quality \nstandards or significantly increase the price of motor \nfuels to the consumer. \n(D) Periods \nThe 2 periods referred to in this paragraph are\u2014 \n(i)  April through September; and  \n(ii) January through March and October through \nDecember. \n\n18a \n \n(E) Exclusion \nRenewable fuel blended or consumed in calendar year \n2006 in a State that has received a waiver under sec-\ntion 7543(b) of this title shall not be included in the \nstudy under subparagraph (A). \n(F) State exemption from seasonality require-\nments \nNotwithstanding any other provision of law, the sea-\nsonality requirement relating to renewable fuel use es-\ntablished by this paragraph shall not apply to any \nState that has received a waiver under section 7543(b) \nof this title or any State dependent on refineries in \nsuch State for gasoline supplies. \n(7) Waivers \n(A) In general \nThe Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary \nof Agriculture and the Secretary of Energy, may \nwaive the requirements of paragraph (2) in whole or in \npart on petition by one or more States, by any person \nsubject to the requirements of this subsection, or by \nthe Administrator on his own motion by reducing the \nnational quantity of renewable fuel required under \nparagraph (2)\u2014 \n(i) based on a determination by the Administrator, \nafter public notice and opportunity for comment, that \nimplementation of the requirement would severely \nharm the economy or environment of a State, a region, \nor the United States; or \n(ii) based on a determination by the Administrator, \nafter public notice and opportunity for comment, that \nthere is an inadequate domestic supply. \n\n19a \n \n(B) Petitions for waivers \nThe Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary \nof Agriculture and the Secretary of Energy, shall ap-\nprove or disapprove a petition for a waiver of the re-\nquirements of paragraph (2) within 90 days after the \ndate on which the petition is received by the Adminis-\ntrator. \n(C) Termination of waivers \nA waiver granted under subparagraph (A) shall termi-\nnate after 1 year, but may be renewed by the Admin-\nistrator after consultation with the Secretary of Agri-\nculture and the Secretary of Energy. \n(D) Cellulosic biofuel \n(i) For any calendar year for which the projected \nvolume of cellulosic biofuel production is less than the \nminimum applicable volume established under para-\ngraph (2)(B), as determined by the Administrator \nbased on the estimate provided under paragraph \n(3)(A), not later than November 30 of the preceding \ncalendar year, the Administrator shall reduce the ap-\nplicable volume of cellulosic biofuel required under \nparagraph (2)(B) to the projected volume available \nduring that calendar year. For any calendar year in \nwhich the Administrator makes such a reduction, the \nAdministrator may also reduce the applicable volume \nof renewable fuel and advanced biofuels requirement \nestablished under paragraph (2)(B) by the same or a \nlesser volume. \n(ii) Whenever the Administrator reduces the min-\nimum cellulosic biofuel volume under this subpara-\ngraph, the Administrator shall make available for sale \ncellulosic biofuel credits at the higher of $0.25 per gal-\nlon or the amount by which $3.00 per gallon exceeds \nthe average wholesale price of a gallon of gasoline in \n\n20a \n \nthe United States. Such amounts shall be adjusted for \ninflation by the Administrator for years after 2008. \n(iii)  Eighteen months after December 19, 2007, the \nAdministrator shall promulgate regulations to govern \nthe issuance of credits under this subparagraph. The \nregulations shall set forth the method for determining \nthe exact price of credits in the event of a waiver. The \nprice of such credits shall not be changed more fre-\nquently than once each quarter. These regulations \nshall include such provisions, including limiting the \ncredits\u2019 uses and useful life, as the Administrator \ndeems appropriate to assist market liquidity and \ntransparency, to provide appropriate certainty for \nregulated entities and renewable fuel producers, and \nto limit any potential misuse of cellulosic biofuel cred-\nits to reduce the use of other renewable fuels, and for \nsuch other purposes as the Administrator determines \nwill help achieve the goals of this subsection. The reg-\nulations shall limit the number of cellulosic biofuel \ncredits for any calendar year to the minimum applica-\nble volume (as reduced under this subparagraph) of \ncellulosic biofuel for that year. \n(E) Biomass-based diesel \n(i)  Market evaluation \nThe Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary \nof Energy and the Secretary of Agriculture, shall pe-\nriodically evaluate the impact of the biomass-based \ndiesel requirements established under this paragraph \non the price of diesel fuel. \n(ii)  Waiver \nIf the Administrator determines that there is a signif-\nicant renewable feedstock disruption or other market \ncircumstances that would make the price of biomass-\nbased diesel fuel increase significantly, the Admin- \n\n21a \n \nistrator, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy \nand the Secretary of Agriculture, shall issue an order \nto reduce, for up to a 60-day period, the quantity of bi-\nomass-based diesel required under subparagraph (A) \nby an appropriate quantity that does not exceed 15 \npercent of the applicable annual requirement for bio-\nmass-based diesel. For any calendar year in which the \nAdministrator makes a reduction under this subpara-\ngraph, the Administrator may also reduce the applica-\nble volume of renewable fuel and advanced biofuels re-\nquirement established under paragraph (2)(B) by the \nsame or a lesser volume. \n(iii) Extensions \nIf the Administrator determines that the feedstock \ndisruption or circumstances described in clause (ii) is \ncontinuing beyond the 60-day period described in \nclause (ii) or this clause, the Administrator, in consul-\ntation with the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary \nof Agriculture, may issue an order to reduce, for up to \nan additional 60-day period, the quantity of biomass-\nbased diesel required under subparagraph (A) by an \nappropriate quantity that does not exceed an addi-\ntional 15 percent of the applicable annual requirement \nfor biomass-based diesel. \n(F) Modification of applicable volumes \nFor any of the tables in paragraph (2)(B), if the Ad-\nministrator waives\u2014 \n(i) at least 20 percent of the applicable volume re-\nquirement set forth in any such table for 2 consecutive \nyears; or \n(ii) at least 50 percent of such volume requirement \nfor a single year, the Administrator shall promulgate \na rule (within 1 year after issuing such waiver) that \nmodifies the applicable volumes set forth in the table \n\n22a \n \nconcerned for all years following the final year to \nwhich the waiver applies, except that no such modifi-\ncation in applicable volumes shall be made for any year \nbefore 2016. In promulgating such a rule, the Admin-\nistrator shall comply with the processes, criteria, and \nstandards set forth in paragraph (2)(B)(ii). \n(8) Study and waiver for initial year of program \n(A) In general \nNot later than 180 days after August 8, 2005, the Sec-\nretary of Energy shall conduct for the Administrator \na study assessing whether the renewable fuel require-\nment under paragraph (2) will likely result in signifi-\ncant adverse impacts on consumers in 2006, on a na-\ntional, regional, or State basis. \n(B) Required evaluations \nThe study shall evaluate renewable fuel\u2014 \n(i) supplies and prices; \n(ii) blendstock supplies; and  \n(iii) supply and distribution system capabilities. \n(C) Recommendations by the Secretary \nBased on the results of the study, the Secretary of En-\nergy shall make specific recommendations to the Ad-\nministrator concerning waiver of the requirements of \nparagraph (2), in whole or in part, to prevent any ad-\nverse impacts described in subparagraph (A). \n(D) Waiver \n(i)  In general \nNot later than 270 days after August 8, 2005, the Ad-\nministrator shall, if and to the extent recommended by \nthe Secretary of Energy under subparagraph (C), \nwaive, in whole or in part, the renewable fuel require-\nment under paragraph (2) by reducing the national \n\n23a \n \nquantity of renewable fuel required under paragraph \n(2) in calendar year 2006. \n(ii)  No effect on waiver authority \nClause (i) does not limit the authority of the Adminis-\ntrator to waive the requirements of paragraph (2) in \nwhole, or in part, under paragraph (7). \n(9)  Small refineries \n(A) Temporary exemption \n(i) In general \nThe requirements of paragraph (2) shall not apply to \nsmall refineries until calendar year 2011. \n(ii)  Extension of exemption \n(I) Study by Secretary of Energy \nNot later than December 31, 2008, the Secretary of \nEnergy shall conduct for the Administrator a study to de-\ntermine whether compliance with the requirements of \nparagraph (2) would impose a disproportionate economic \nhardship on small refineries. \n(II) Extension of exemption \nIn the case of a small refinery that the Secretary \nof Energy determines under subclause (I) would be sub-\nject to a disproportionate economic hardship if required \nto comply with paragraph (2), the Administrator shall ex-\ntend the exemption under clause (i) for the small refinery \nfor a period of not less than 2 additional years. \n(B) Petitions based on disproportionate eco-\nnomic hardship \n(i) Extension of exemption \nA small refinery may at any time petition the Admin-\nistrator for an extension of the exemption under \n\n24a \n \nsubparagraph (A) for the reason of disproportionate \neconomic hardship. \n(ii) Evaluation of petitions \nIn evaluating a petition under clause (i), the Adminis-\ntrator, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, \nshall consider the findings of the study under subpar-\nagraph (A)(ii) and other economic factors. \n(iii) Deadline for action on petitions \nThe Administrator shall act on any petition submitted \nby a small refinery for a hardship exemption not later \nthan 90 days after the date of receipt of the petition. \n(C) Credit program \nIf a small refinery notifies the Administrator that the \nsmall refinery waives the exemption under subpara-\ngraph (A), the regulations promulgated under para-\ngraph (2)(A) shall provide for the generation of credits \nby the small refinery under paragraph (5) beginning \nin the calendar year following the date of notification. \n(D) Opt-in for small refineries \nA small refinery shall be subject to the requirements \nof paragraph (2) if the small refinery notifies the Ad-\nministrator that the small refinery waives the exemp-\ntion under subparagraph (A). \n(10)  Ethanol market concentration analysis \n(A) Analysis \n(i) In general \nNot later than 180 days after August 8, 2005, and an-\nnually thereafter, the Federal Trade Commission \nshall perform a market concentration analysis of the \nethanol production industry using the Herfindahl-\nHirschman Index to determine whether there is \n\n25a \n \nsufficient competition among industry participants to \navoid price-setting and other anticompetitive behav-\nior. \n(ii) Scoring \nFor the purpose of scoring under clause (i) using the \nHerfindahl-Hirschman Index, all marketing arrange-\nments among industry participants shall be consid-\nered. \n(B) Report \nNot later than December 1, 2005, and annually there-\nafter, the Federal Trade Commission shall submit to \nCongress and the Administrator a report on the re-\nsults of the market concentration analysis performed \nunder subparagraph (A)(i). \n(11) Periodic reviews \nTo allow for the appropriate adjustment of the re-\nquirements described in subparagraph (B) of para-\ngraph (2), the Administrator shall conduct periodic re-\nviews of\u2014 \n(A) existing technologies;
